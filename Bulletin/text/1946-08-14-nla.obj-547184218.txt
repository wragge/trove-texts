LONDON AS QUEEN VICTORIA KNEW THE HEART OF EMPIRE.
ANCIENT “ALL SAINTS.” OF CHINGFORD.
peacefully atop the Mount in Chingford a few
miles north from the busy metropolis, this picturesque old
church dates from the early fourteenth century. Abandoned in
1844, the church was partly restored in 1873, and used during the
Queen’s reign for divine service during the summer seasons. It
belongs to the late Early English and Decorated periods. The old
red brick of which the church is built is covered with ivy, and,
overgrown with the growth, the roof collapsed in February, 1904.
The parkland spaced between this fine old church and the River
Lea is still known as “The King’s Mead,” and the name of Ching-
ford is a reminder of the ancient times when regal huntsmen crossed
the Lea by the “King’s Ford.”

EXPERIMENTAL STORIES.
It would not be worth while to subject to
serious critical examination the introduc-
tion which a Mr. Tom Harrisson has
written for Dal Stivens’s The Courtship
of Uncle Henry (Reed and Harris, Ltd.);
for serious criticism would have to be
very discouraging indeed to Mr. Harris-
son:—
Times telescope, the small end outward,
shrinks movement into moments, Oceans
into hours, Continents down to Catalinas,
the spacious liberty of uncharted jungle
and desert into roaring Liberators easily
looking down on (or doing over) all
Haste is first cousin to efficiency, the ethic
of a stage beyond industrialism, and unre-
lated to that peasant or pleasant nature
which is (by testament of sperm or eel or
dandelion head) prodigal or illogical in-
exactitude The new, growing style, which
had its origins somewhere around James
Joyce is a return towards the discursive
dissatisfaction with the streamline, swas-
tikaed paraphernalia of super-efficiency and
quantitative strength Dal Stivens is a
very reputable protege of the discursive re-
naissance, with the emphasis rather on im-
mediate complex than stopwatch simplicity.
As a piece of English criticism, some
distance after Hazlitt and Matthew
Arnold, this is awful. Mr. Stivens was
not wise to print it.
There is a good deal to be said for
Mr. Stivens. In the first place, even
though he uses the Hemingway short sen-
tence and short paragraph—which he
naively admits in a story about a reporter
are the convention of contemporary jour-
nalese —he writes very much better prose
than Mr. Harrisson. It is, at least, lucid.
And then he has touches of humor.
The title story has some brief, genuinely
amusing glimpses of humanity ; and there
are several others which, if hardly more
than anecdotes, do sincerely try to convey
the typical humor of the Australian out-
back. In a thin, arty sort of way, Mr.
Stivens is striving to emulate Steele Rudd.
And his observation, though limited
there are no carcasses hanging in the
butcher’s ’shop of “Funny About That
Canary”—is nearly always precise and
sometimes even beautiful:
The back of his hand rested on the plank
cupping a half-eaten peach: it was almost
as if the fingers were the setting for a large
rough jewel.
Mr. Stivens is more keenly aware than
most Australian short-story writers of the
changing patterns of contemporary life;
or at least, except in a very silly story
about some squatters and three noble
Communists, he is able to write about
significant contemporary events without
appearing merely “documentary” or
cheaply topical. Though it is marred in
the book version by the sentimental end-
ing “You Go, Florence Nightingale,”
which was first published in The Bulle-
tin, is an effective glimpse of sailors and
their girls in war-time ; and “The Dago’s
Wife,” about a Greek restaurant in a
country town, rings true in a rather
squalid and pointless sort of way.
It is also worth noting that the author
is aware of both city and country. After
a surfeit of bush writing it is pleasant
to come across Sydney place-names, and
such a faithful glimpse of Sydney land-
scape as this:
They pushed through the glass doors and
went down the steps to George-sfreet. The
street was browned-qut and they couldn’t
see clearly for a minute. After the dance
floor the street seemed quiet. They saw
the dark' Town Hall tower with the grey-
white faces of the clock A tram whined
along Elizabeth-street and its pole struck
out blue sparks as though from an emery
wheel.
There is, too, a measure of narrative
interest in the book: some of the stories,
that is, such as the one about the man
suffering from delusions who laid soot
on a path to track his wife’s imaginary
lovers, are genuinely interesting stories.
Like all the rest of the book, these
macabre anecdotes are far too sketchily
told ; and perhaps, if they were done at
greater length, they would turn out —like
Mr. Stivens’s extremely vegetarian stories
about the killing of animals —somewhat
repellent: but at least, as they stand, they
have a flicker of interest, of strangeness.
And, lastly, there is the experimental
interest of the collection; for even if
experiment is of special and momentous
importance only to angry penguins it
does give variety.
But when all that has been said in its
favor, it must be added that there is not
a single fully satisfying story in the book ;
nothing rich, nothing to remember,
nothing one would want to read twice.
The work lacks body. The outback
comedies, submitted as “folk lore,” are
hardly of the substance of a Bulletin
“Aboriginalities” paragraph ; the macabre
stories read like plots for stories, ideas
for stories, anecdotes picked up by chance
and hardly developed beyond the anec-
dote. Sometimes we have the raw
materials only; sometimes the frame-
work of a story ; never the finished struc-
ture. The fantastic mannerisms of such
a piece as “A Love Story” leave one with
the impression that Mr. Stivens is “only
fooling,” like a clown who really isn’t
funny,
Mr. Stivens seems capable of more
valuable activity than that of frolicking
with angry penguins.
Sea and Thistledown.
Though they are written in a different
style, some of the poems in W. Hart-
Smith’s The Unceasing Ground (Angus
and Robertson) attempt a subtle humor
like that of Shaw Neilson’s lyrics. Shaw
Neilson wrote of the blue wren:
All children who have seen him are gladder
for all time,
He spells Romance and Comedy, his body is a
chime;
And he often says to my heart “How thin of
blood are you!”
And he puts into the broad sunshine his melody
of blue.
And Hart-Smith writes of the mudlark;
There is no compromise about him at all:
Black is black, and white is white.
He flies untidily, and when he walks
There is nothing of him,
Only a thin body and a petulant cry.
Strange little bird, is that you high up there,
High up there attacking the hawk,
The brown and evil hawk?
Writing of this sort needs rhyme. It is
partly epigrammatic in intention, and
epigrams must be sharply defined and
finished with a “click” or they are no-
thing. It is as if Hart-Smith would
attempt to write “The Rape of the Lock”
not in heroic couplets but in free verse ;
as if he were trying to stab somebody with
a feather; for rhyme is the “click” and
rhyme the stabbing point in epigrammatic
poetry. A rhyme at the end saves his
“Eaglehawk” from complete formless-
ness, and, because it is rhymed through-
out, his “Spider,” slight though, it is, is
better than any of the little nature-pieces:
Not for him pattern
Of spiral and spoke,
Only a nebulous
Silvery smoke.
It is the same when, again inviting com-
parison with Shaw Neilson, Hart-Smith
attempts a more refined subtlety and
delicacy. “Thistledown,” on the surface
about a ball of thistledown being caught
by the waves, and possibly intended as an
image of the turmoil and danger of life,
is probably meant to have the effect of
Neilson’s
Let your voice be delicate.
How faint a thing
Is Love, little Love crying
Under the Spring.
But Hart-Smith’s poem falls a long way
short: —•
At last, at the very end,
committed the indiscretion, ’
kissed the sea,
ever so delicately touched an upflung
wave-crest, kissed it ever so lightly.
Once again, it is the technique at
fault; the absence of rhyme. The lines
of free verse, so painstakingly set out, are
like a frame for something that isn’t
there ; that something being poetry.
In seven short poems about Columbus
there is a genuine subtlety. And also, it
is noticeable, rhyme:
The woman drowned, they say, had almond
eyes.
Masters, a ship, a ship, for ray youth dies!
It is in accord with the general elusive-
ness of the book that these poems should
be fragmentary and scattered, mere
glimpses of Columbus and his voyage,
lacking even the few explanatory notes
they obviously need. But they are re-
markably effective glimpses ; not thistle-
down but real salt-water;
They saw a rope of cloud twist down
And a tongue of sea drawn up as the whirlwind
blew,
Drinking the ocean up in a plume of foam.
“Santa Maria, look! . ~ how far is home.”
And some knelt down, some checked their
blasphemy,
Eyes wide and mouths wide, dumb.
Columbus, watching, touched his brow and
breast.
“Christ be with us!” he said as the ship sped
west.
Fugitives in the Snow.
The smoke from our fire nearly blinded
us. We could see only with pain and great
concentration. To let the smoke out we
thrust up a sapling through the snow. The
drift snow is piled up above our buco
(cave) to a height of ten feet or more. Bert
drew my attention to the footprints of a
wolf in the snow above our buco. Our
first concern was to collect firewood, and
we did this by breaking the fops off the
trees which were sticking out above the
snow.
The quotation is from John E. Broad’s
Poor People, Poor Us (H. H. Tombs,
Ltd., Wellington, N.Z.). A New Zealand
soldier who was captured at Ruweisat
Ridge, Broqd writes on the whole a very
readable account of his adventures. In
his opening chapters there is some of the
guidebook information that mars so
many soldiers’ narratives;
Geologically dating from the fluvio-
marine period, the Nile, with its head-
waters in Abyssinia and the Sudan, has
continued to flow in its present valley for
centuries.
But once Broad really starts on the
story of his captivity the only blemishes
worth mentioning, and they are not
serious, are some jerkiness when the
author quotes from his diary and a ten-
dency to use a highfalutin and melo-
dramatic language. Simplicity is welcome
in all writers, and especially in inex-
perienced ones.
A dramatic highlight in the book is
the account of a brief escape from cap-
tivity in the desert, when Broad and his
fellow-escapees go walking along a road
in enemy territory, trying, with remark-
able success, to look like Germans when
they meet Italians and like Italians when
they meet Germans. The chapters in
which Broad is in hiding among the
Apennines after the capitulation of Italy
—before the country is liberated from
the Germans —make an exciting story,
and Broad gives some very pleasant pic-
tures of the Italian peasants who be-
friended him.
The Eye and the Ear.
Reading Kylie Tennant’s latest novel,
Lost Haven, I noticed that her writing
is full of appeal to the sense of sight.
For instance, “The sky ruffled flamingo
feathers, little fiery plumes burning out
of grey.” One does not find, though,
that she is as sensitive to sound effects
as she is to scenic.
G. B. Shaw and other observers en-
dorse a well-founded theory that each of
us thinks with a bias either to the sense
of sight or to the sense of sound; that
thoughts come in the form of a vision
or picture (from the sense of sight) or in
the form of speech and intonations (from
the sense of sound). With many of us
the bias would be only slight. With
some, however, the bias would be nearly
total: a musician, for instance, is almost
exclusively a “hearer,” but a designer
or a pictorial artist is mainly a “see-er.”
Writers, generally, are believed to have
a bias towards the sense of sound, but
there are many obvious exceptions.
The theory at one time so interested
me that I made inquiries among
librarians who separately cater for the
literary tastes of the blind and of the
deaf and dumb. I found that Stevenson
is particularly., popular with the blind,
but that he makes little appeal to the
congenitally deaf.
Stevenson is a great player upon
sound. I quote from Treasure Island,
at random, but within the space of a few
pages: “Nothing but the low wash of
the ripple and the croaking of the crows
in the wood” ~. “Our old clock began
striking. This sudden noise startled us
shockingly” ... “A low whistle sounded
a good way off upon the hill” ... “The
window of the captain’s room was
thrown open with a slam and a jingle of
broken glass” ... “A sound that brought
my heart into my mouth —the tap-
tapping of the blind man’s stick upon the
frozen road.” It is easy to understand
why Stevenson would appeal so strongly
to those who hear but cannot see, and,
conversely, why he should have much
less appeal for those who see but cannot
hear.
In Lost Haven, however, the imagery
is nearly all visual. “The water soaked
up the reflected light in blackness and
the trees soaked it up in their shadows”
... “Jamaica had once been a beauty, a
big blonde with a marble-white body and
chilly blue eyes.” Kylie Tennant could
stir the deaf, but the congenitally blind
would understand little of her.
I suppose the ideal writing would
appeal equally to the eye and the ear ;
and you would find it, probably, in
Conrad.

Song.
Over the walls the wet wind streamed,
Tears and spun hair; and you lay still.
Close in my arms your body glowed.
And love was all its will.
A foam of lamplight flecked the street
With sallow snows of leaves and faces,
That tossed about the room in waves
Of hurried steps and voices.
The crazy frogs like singing wires
Thrilled in a plot of damps and chill.
We listened ... Leapt a spark between,
And love was all its will'.

A Robin.
The vast cold silver sky
Gleams in the pool on the bluff
And the bush is grey after rain;
Little, oh, little enough
Is a morsel of wild bush robin
As long as your little finger
—A thing you could hide in your hand—
To feed the heart’s great hunger
That could devour whole skies
Flaring with sunset red,
Mountains of fiery c010r ...
Bright black eyes, black head,
And one white feather in his wing.
Flashing from twig to rock,
From rock to the shallow pool
That reels with the tiny shock.
The robin darts to bathe
Breast-deep in the sky’s reflection.
And all that icy france
Breaks in most sweet destruction.
Little, oh, little enough
To fill the heart’s great need.
But when he has splashed his wings
And dipped his dainty head
And spilled the drops down his back
And flown as quick as he came.
There is no need any more
To wish the mountains to flame.
For still it seems in the pool
That breast of crimson glows
And over the whole cold sky
Runs wave after wave of rose.

To An Old Woman, Tatting.
You, who have known the flood and
ebbing tide.
Now wait, where unwilling memory
crests and booms
On beaches half in darkness; there to
grasp
Wind-wrested foam-flakes in your knotted
hands,
And in the quiet of an evening room
You probe with steel their white and
sunlit lace.
But you are caught in firmer mesh than
this.
Summer and winter, weaving sixty strands,
Have veiled your hands and face in gos-
samer
And webbed your days into a netted tree,
Perilous to break with fluttering of birds.
A seagull cries one moment in you, and
another
Voice from a decade spent out Roma way
Beats failing wings for audience.
In your hands
The chuckling bobbin, skimming through
the foam,
Betrays the sound of chains that hold
them fast
Beyond desire to seize your jiife agam.

Biographical details of Steele Rudd (Arthur
Hoey Davis ) ?
Bora on November 14, 1868, he was educated
at Emu Creek (Q.) State School and spent some
of his youth working on sheep and cattle
stations. He entered the Qld. civil service in
1886, and was Clerk of the Sheriff’s Office from
1889 to 1902, then Under-Sheriff until 1903.
He was secretary to the Queensland Royal Com-
mission on the Cloncurry-Normanton railway,
then became full-time contributor of miscellane-
ous bush matter to the Brisbane Press and The
Bulletin. He won fame with On Our Selection
(1899); this was followed by a number of
other books of the same type.
What i&the “bombora v in Sydney Harbor?
“Bombora” is an aboriginal word applied to
the high-crested wave which* breaks, even on
windless days, over submerged rocks near the
coastline and in some cases at entrances to
coastal harbors and inlets. There are one or
two bomboras near North Head at the entrance
to Sydney Harbor, also one at the entrance to
Botany Bay, which is marked on the Admiralty
Chart No. 2179.
(1) What course does the Hawkesbury River
(N.S.W.) take ? (2) Why is it known under dif-
ferent names in different places ? (3) Length ?
(1) It has its source at the southern end of
Lake George, in the Mulwarree Ponds. This
creek runs north to join the Wollondilly a
little north of Goulburn, and under the latter
name traverses deep gorges (of which Burrago-
rang is the best known) in the ranges west of
Berrima and Picton until it receives the Cox
River from the Blue Mountains. Thence known
as the Warragamba, it flows through another
gorge into the Nepean, takes that name and
proceeds n.-e. past Penrith to meet the Grose;
from the junction with this river the stream is
known as the Hawkesbury, and passes Rich-
mond and Windsor to enter the drowned estuary
at Broken Bay. (2) Because various portions
were discovered and named before their con-
nection was known. (3) 335 miles.
Who was Griselda in fiction ?
The heroine of a folk-story, versions of which
are to be found in the works of Boccaccio, of
Chaucer and Petrarch. She was a very beauti-
ful peasant girl who was wooed by a marquis.
She became his wife, and to assure himself of
the worth and stability of her character he put
her to the severest ordeals, through all of
which she passed successfully.
Why is copper piping used in domestic hot-
water systems when mild steel pipes are used
successfully in boilers and steam-power plants?
Copper is used in hot-water systems because
of its higher thermal conductivity and greater
resistance to corrosion. In steam-power plants
pressures considerably above atmospheric are
developed, and mild steel is used because its
tensile strength is much higher than that of
copper, while in domestic water services pres-
sures seldom rise above atmospheric. In
boilers, etc., special measures are taken against
corrosion (such as treating boiler water with
anti-corrosive chemicals), but domestic services
are designed to operate without regular over-
hauling and the extra expense of using copper
fittings is considered worth while to ensure this.
How is concrete set under water ?
The mixture is made up 1:2:3, with a very
small allowance of water. It is essential that
there be little or no movement in the water
surrounding the concrete. If there is much
movement a cofferdam must be constructed
around the structure and (in the case
of sea water) concrete must be applied only
between tides. The concrete is sent through a
large tube or box, known as a tremie spout,
right to the bottom. The spout is gently
lifted a few inches at a time as fresh supplies
of concrete are placed.
Method of drying mulga wood ?
Protect the ends of the mulga pieces by
applying either two coats bituminous paint,
three coats varnish, two coats lead-based paint,
or a heavy coating of grease. Lay the pieces
out in rows, each row separated by strips or
stickers of lin. or -jin. These stacks should
be protected from the sun and-preferably placed
where there is a very small current of air such
as under a house or shed and covered with
bags or dry sawdust.
My Australian silky dog constantly scratches
and pulls out his hair. He has a weekly bath
and apparently no fleas. Cause and cure ?
The dog is probably suffering from mild
dermatitis owing to wrong feeding. Put him on
a milk diet for a time, with the addition of
vegetables chopped fine, and twice a week give
a feed of raw meat only. Don’t feed more tfian
twice a day. Give two baths at weekly intervals
of loz. potassium sulphurata dissolved in one
gallon of water.
Differences between the words slush, sludge
and slosh ?
The differences are not very clear. There is
the natural one, ' resulting from the stickier
sound, that sludge is usually applied to some-
thing less liquid than slush or slosh, e.g., to
slimy deposits or clinging mud, whereas thaw-
ing snow is typical slush; and of slush and
slosh the latter is perhaps more often used to
describe what is metaphorically watery stuff
twaddle or sentimentality.

RECOLLECTIONS OF THE GIPPSLANI) BUSH-
FIRES DURING THE MID-’NINETIES.
Settlers and farmers
In distress did bewail,
Dense clouds of smoke
The horizon did veil.
Prime herds of cattle.
Farms and stations
Were reduced to ashes
By the conflagrations.
Huge burning trees with
A crashing sound fell
And tangled scrub crackled
From the surging hell.
Sons of the bush,
Strong, active and brave,
Coped with the fires
Human lives to save.
I’m a weary Casanova
Who can see the emptiness of his life.
I’ll give up being a lover
And find a nice rich wife.
Swaggie Sam got roaring drunk
And went to the city to get a wife.
He used up his money in buying junk
But declares he had the time of his life.

THE PSYCHOLOCISTS
By E.O. SHLUNKE
EVER since Browning met the
officials at the station he had been
talking about his unique and
peculiar stomach trouble, and the
devices he was obliged to use to avoid
being “shouted” alcoholic drinks by his
friends. But as they approached Herb
Schulz’s farm he became more businesslike.
“We’ll have to approach this fellow
carefully,” he advised. »“They say he’s a
difficult man to get on with. Lives here
all alone, and hardly ever speaks to any-
one. According to gossip, he was dis-
appointed in love about twenty years ago,
and never got over it.”
The three officials thought it over, then
Heron, who was the acknowledged senior,
said:
“The psychology of the misogynist is
interesting, but simple.”
Browning did not appear to be im-
pressed. He started talking about his own
affairs again ; telling them how greatly he
had improved his driving comfort by paint-
ing the upper half of his windshield green
until he pulled up at Herb Schulz’s gate.
It was a heavy iron gate, festooned
with barbed wire, like the fence, and
fastened with a strong chain as well as a
massive latch; it looked as if Herb
Schulz not only meant to prevent his
stock getting out, but to discourage people
coming in.
The farm was low-lying, uniformly flat
and bare of trees. A bitterly cold south-
west wind swept across it unchecked,
bending the tall coarse grass and driving
up the odor of the small green weeds
which grew on the semi-swampy land.
The car shuddered over the rarely-used
track bogged and rutted by cattle. The
flat green was relieved by sprinkles of
sheep and cattle.
A small unpainted
weatherboard cot-
tage was flanked by
a number of uneasy-
looking sheds. A
couple of nervous
young sheepdogs
barked at them, then
retreated hastily
under a tankstand.
The front door looked as if it hadn’t
been opened for years. Browning led the
way round the back, with the pups alter-
nately barking bravely and withdrawing.
They knocked on the back door but
there was no answer.
“Not at home,” said Heron.
“He might be in one of the sheds,”
said Browning.
He called loudly but there was no re-
sponse.
“We’ll have a look,” he said hopefully.
T'HEY looked into a surprisingly neat
* smithy, a stable with a chaffhouse full
of sweet-smelling wheaten chaff, a garage
with a well-kept old Chev. tourer, then,
rounding a corner, they were suddenly in
the middle of a great flock of white Leg-
horn hens, all craning their eager necks
towards an open doorway, into which
the leaders were venturing greedily but
fearfully.
“He must be in there,” said Browning.
The rearguard scattered in outraged
consternation as the party advanced,
making a great noise, and beating up a'
cloud of poultry-perfumed dust. Another
panic started in the shed and poultry
poured out in several agitated waves. A
man loomed in the doorway with a
bucket of wheat in one hand and a large
dish of eggs in the other. He looked
resentful and embarrassed.
He was an ungainly man with a per-
manent bend at the knees, and a crouch
which made his arms hang in front of
him. He leant back against the door,
still holding his burdens, as if he had a
faint melancholy hope that he would
soon be left to continue his work undis-
turbed, His large brown eyes flickered
nervously from face to face, then he
hung his head in a dogged way, and
fastened his eyes on his foot, which he
stubbed against the opposite door jamb.
Browning advanced with outstretched
hand and greeted him in the most cordial
tones. But Schulz looked at the hand
frowningly, then juggled awkwardly with
his buckets, as if he was going to retain
them to avoid the need to shake hands ;
either that, Browning thought, or he
didn’t remember which hand was used
for shaking. At length he put down
the bucket of wheat and placed a bone-
lessly limp hand in Browning’s. He gave
each of the others a brief fleeting glance,
and the same limp, uncordial hand.
“That’s a fine flock
of hens you have,” said
Browning; his bright,
kindly, brown eyes be-
hind the pointed in-
quiring nose were
openly admiring.
“And they seem to
be laying well,” said
Heron, gazing at the
dish of eggs.
Schulz looked at the
eggs, then at the jost-
ling flock of hens
(which were forming up again expec-
tantly), then hard at Heron.
“There’s about a hundred eggs here,
and three hundred hens there,” he said
tonelessly,
A brief, bitter grimace flitted over his
face, as he saw the momentary defeat in
Heron’s. Browning smiled at him, trying
to think of something good humored and
tactful to say, but Schulz hung his head
sulkily and the opportunity passed.
Browning began to talk optimistically
about the weather, crops, grazing con-
ditions and stock markets ; Schulz either
agreed reluctantly with him, or contra-
dicted him curtly. The official party began
to show signs of impatience, fingering their
portfolios, which Schulz seemed to re-
gard with considerable suspicion.
“We’ve really come to see you about a
big water-diversion scheme,” said Brown-
ing, appearing to be reluctant that their
pleasant private conversation should be
interrupted for business. “I’d better let
Mr. Heron tell you all about it.”
Heron stepped forward briskly and
proceeded to address Schulz on the
general outlines of the Greater South-
Western Water Conservation and Land
Preservation Scheme. Schulz stood with
his head half-tumed away, like a horse
which is being forced to face a hailstorm.
He had such a discouraging effect on
Heron that by degrees his speech was
directed to the other members of his
party, who, having heard it some dozens of
times before, were hard put to maintain
a show of interest for Schulz’s benefit.
WHEN Heron stopped Schulz con-
tinued to crouch in an attitude of
self-defence for a few minutes, as if he
expected the storm to break out again
at any moment. Then he raised his head
and said plaintively:
“What are you insiniwatin’ I do? I
don’t understand your gyber,”
Three identical pained expressions
appeared on the faces of the officials.
But the District Agricultural Instructor
recovered first. He was the junior mem-
ber of the party and rarely got an oppor-
tunity to speak officially. He said
quickly, before he could be interrupted:
“But it does affect you, and Mr. Penn,
the Project Engineer, will tell you just
how. And I can assure you—as your
District Agricultural Instructor —that you
have very much more to gain by the
scheme than you can possibly lose. lam
watching your interests.”
Schulz gave the D.A.I. a startled look,
as if he was realising for the first time
that his interests might be threatened.
Heron said reprovingly:
“Leave it to Penn.”
Penn, who was short, dapper and stout
and appeared to be confused by Schulz’s
attitude, shook himself together ; opened
his portfolio with an impressive manipu-
lation of the zipper and produced a large
map of a section of the country, done
out with contours and a maze of other
markings.
“This is your place, Mr. Schulz,” he
said, placing his finger in the middle of
the confusion.
Schulz looked at it unbelievingly.
“The idea,” Penn went on, “is to divert
the water which runs to waste in Hovell’s
Creek, across your farm in a series of
controlled waterways, into the river, where
it will add substantially to the capacity
of the reservoir.”
He stopped to see if Schulz was taking
it in, and was horrified to see him expand-
ing with rage. Schulz had jerked all the
bends out of his body and towered men-
acingly. A bony fist was shaking and
the rest of his body vibrated in sympathy.
He said in a low, slow but singularly em-
phatic manner:
“So that’s what you’re insiniwatin’ with
all your cunning faces. But just listen
first to me. Not one drop of water will
J let you put on my farm and that’s fiat.”
He brought his fist down violently on
the map, as if he regarded it as the source
of all his trouble. Penn salvaged his
map hastily, then backed away in alarm.
The other officials looked at him with
wordless sympathy. Only Browning re-
mained calm. He said drily to the party.
“I showed you the banks he put up to
keep' the water off his farm.”
Schulz turned fiercely on Browning, but
when he heard what he was saying his ex-
pression relaxed a little. Browning kept
on talking to Schulz while the official
party retired to hold a baffled and pessi-
mistic private conference.
“I’ve got some low-lying land just like
this on my own property,” said Brown-
ing, surveying the land with a slow turn
of his body. “I built a lot of banks in my
day, to keep water off.” He laughed,
lightly and deprecatingly. “But all they
did was keep the water on.”
Schulz frowned at him threateningly,
but he went on amiably.
“I finally discovered that the best thing
was contour banks. One of these scien-
tific Johnnies put me on to it.”
He nodded towards the. officials as if in
astonishment that they should know any-
thing useful. He went on smiling con-
fidently.
“Now, I don’t care how much water
flows on. It irrigates pastures. Man, you
ought to come and see them.”
“Na, don’t you tell me no lies,” Schulz
said, with anger gleaming in his eyes
again. “You’re just a snake, too.”
A HURT look came over Browning’s
•‘Mace. He made a gesture as if dis-
missing the whole subject.
“It’s wonderful, the things that are
happening nowadays,” he said, in the
manner of an agreeable, general observa-
tion, “All sorts of officials running round
the country, spending millions of pounds
on electricity projects and water projects.
When I think of how we valued a pound
in my young days.” He shook his head
reminiscently. “I had to work a fort-
night to earn one, then.”
Schulz blinked his eye a couple of
times. He began to look thoughtful and
less hostile.
“My first job was a drover,” Brown-
ing went on. “I had to be up first in the
morning, and I finished last in the even-
ing.”
Schulz said in a grudging voice:
“I worked for ten bob a week. And
I saved money.”
“That took some doing,” Browning
nodded commendingly. “But you must
admit the money went a lot farther in
those days. Take clothes, for instance.
A good suit for £2, a pair of boots for
five shillings.”
Schulz admitted it with a restrained nod.
“And,” went on Browning, “the clothes
lasted so much longer.” He paused,
and a fondly nostalgic smile spread across
his face. “Remember the old moleskins?”
Schulz’s eye lit up with interest, and he
said agreeably:
“They stood up for years. You
couldn’t wear them out.”
“Tough and solid on the outside,” said
Browning. “And soft and warm inside.”
“You never wore underpants, even in
weather like this,” said Schulz.
“A bit difficult to wash though.”
“That didn’t matter though, the
browny-black color never showed the dirt,”
said Schulz, becoming quite animated.
“Some people objected to the smell,”
said Browning.
“Kept the moths away,” Schulz
asserted stoutly.
“The buttons never came off,” Brown-
ing added.
“And they never shrunk.” Schulz
spoke as though nothing more could or
needed f to be said.
“The white ones were dandy,” Brown-
ing said.
Schulz looked a trifle self-conscious.
“Always wore them on Sundays,” he
confessed,
“Jolly nice they looked, too, when they
were well washed and ironed,” said
Browning.
“With the creases down the sides where
they should -be,” said Schulz.
Browning gave a sigh and murmured
regretfully:
“I don’t expect
that we’ll ever see a
pair of them again.”
Schulz seemed to
hesitate, then his
face took on a know-
ing, conspiratorial
expression.
“That’s what you
think,” he said, and
his face contorted
into a nudging wink and smile.
Browning looked at him in surprise.
“What do you mean?”
“Come here,” said Schulz, and began
to sidle off, beckoning mysteriously.
Browning followed him into his house.
When they came out again, twenty
minutes later, the two men were walking
shoulder-to-shoulder like old friends. A
smile of carefully regulated approval
appeared on Heron’s face.
“I think we can start taking measure-
ments,” he said.
He did know a bit about psychology.
THE DEVIL AND THE ANCEL (7).
We climbed some stairs to reach the
topmost tower
Wrought to a twist that doubled out theif
length
So far that, midway, I must catch my
breath;
The Prince of Darkness always just ahead
Smiling with that same downward slant-
ing glance
That stirs me to unease.
“These men,” I said,
“Who build them ivory towers build
high enough” —
“T faith!” quoth he. (Odd phrase for
him I thought it,
But let it pass.)
We knocked. The door creaked back-
wards on its hinges.
He made no move —intent cartographer
Peering at parchments stretched upon a
lectern,
With round him compasses and mariners’
measures.
Sextants, projectors, curious phials of
inks ;
Shells and a shrunken head —these foreign
things
Brought by rough sailors, held in hairy
hands
Or knotted up in gaudy handkerchiefs.
“So, this,” they told him,
“From Hy-Brasil, and this from
Martinique.”
The old man, listening gravely while they
spun
Their tales of strife and wonder, traced
there a coastline
Or else upon his map wrote —“Here are
Tygers,
N.S.W.
Having it from a Spaniard, right ear gone
And wooden leg where one was clawed
away.”
The Devil woke me from my fit of
dreaming.
“Old man,” he told him, ‘‘you must take
a journey ;
Choose Heaven or Hell, for one’s your
destination."
He stared. “I seek for Terra Incognita,
The Unknown Land —I map the world
this way” ——
And would have shown us all his coasts
and ranges,
The margins of the world, the Blessed
Islands
And where the uncharted, unknown
oceans lay.
But that I spoke. Showed from my store
of knowledge
Much that is past and present and to
come.
The Devil, meanwhile, whistling inatten-
tion.
Leant by the panes and spied the market-
square
Till — “Heavejn,” I said. “There’s your
only Incognita.
Good sir, all’s known of earth, or will
be shortly;
Ahead lies Heaven —a yet uncharted
vastness.”
Then said the Devil ‘‘Or else ahead lies
Hell;
That too’s for your discovery.”
‘‘Both, both !” he cried, and gathered up
his compass.
We spread our hands and sighed at one
another.

UNCABLED ADDITIONS
THE GREATEST TRIALS IN HISTORY.
(Based on articles, reports, speeches, etc., from the sources acknowledged.)
Critics of the Experiment
When the indictment drawn up against
24 former leaders of Germany and. six
Nazi organisations was first put forward
about a month in advance of the Nurem-
berg trials, the N.Y. “Times” commented
that “if Germany had won the war the
24 high-ranking Nazis would be jailers,
not prisoners; their crimes would be
overlooked or regarded as praiseworthy
achievements ; and their wishes would be
international law.”
“Hie new Tribunal exists, its indict-
ment is valid and its sentences will be
carried out,” the comment added, “be-
cause it was the Allies, not Germany, that
won.”
The N.Y. “Herald Tribune” of the
same date (Oct. 19, 1945) described the in-
dictment as “unprecedented,” and added;
“The process whereby the indicted will be
tried has no analogy in history, unless
the attempt to bring about a similar trial
after World War I may be so considered.
For the first time mankind is attempting
to make war a crime—not merely un-
successful war but war itself. It is
attempting to register a judgment and en-
force it by individual and group penalties
against those who plotted war and
brought it upon the w0r1d.... This is a
new thing, a new method evolved in an
attempt to permit law and justice to keep
pace with the terrible growth of war as
an institution.”
Origin of the Trials
Clear statements on the intention to
hold war trials were made comparatively
early—on October 8, 1942—by President
Roosevelt and the then Lord Chancellor
of Britain, Sir John Simon.
Stating that provision would be duly
made “for the surrender to the United
Nations of war criminals,” and announc-
ing the establishment of a commission for
the investigation of war crimes in advance
of the proposed trials, Mr. Roosevelt
said; “The number of persons eventually
found guilty will undoubtedly be ex-
tremely small compared to the total
enemy populations. It is not the inten-
tion of this Government or of the Gov-
ernments associated with us to resort to
mass reprisals. It is our intention that
just and sure punishment shall be meted
out to the ringleaders responsible for the
organised murder of thousands of inno-
cent persons and the commission of
atrocities which have violated every tenet
of the Christian faith.”
Sir John Simon said that the aim was
“the punishment of individuals.... who
are proved to be themselves responsible,
whether as ringleaders or as actual per-
petrators, for atrocities.”
Those statements can be said to have
set the precedent. The commission was
put to work accumulating evidence, and
such a mass of it was gathered that, with
breaks at Christmas add Easter, the Mili-
tary Tribunal acting on the trials has
been at work since last November. That
Tribunal, however, was not established
until August 8, 1945, when it was set up
through agreement reached by represen-
tatives of Great Britain, Russia, France
and America. That date, and not the
Roosevelt-Simon date, has been taken by
some critics as the origin of trials.
For instance, K. R. Price, a former Judge-
advocate and defence counsel with the
U.S. forces, in a N.Y. “Times” letter;
The simple and undisputed truth is that until
August 8 there was no law, legal precedent,
treaty or custom justifying the imposition Of
criminal punishment for the planning or waging
of a war of aggression or a war in violation of
international agreement.
It may be admitted that under hundreds of
treaties nations have agreed not to go to
war with each other. But not even its [Kellogg
Pact’s] most extreme opponents had ever before
claimed that it contemplated criminal punish-
merit of the leaders of the offending Govern-
ment.
Now if a thing, though formerly a crime as
between States, subject to State remedies such as
reprisals and the exaction of indemnities, is
newly made an individual crime, subject to
bodily punishment, then an entirely new law
has been enacted. If the new law is applied to
alleged offences committed prior to its enact-
ment, its operation is ex post facto, violating
the basic law of every civilised nation If,
m addition, as here, the so-called law is de-
creed by representatives of the executives of
several victorious Powers to be imposed upon
their defeated enemies, and upon them alone,
his .not a law at all. It is an entirely specious
selt-jtestification for popularly desired revenge.
Mr. Price went on to declare that the
policy “will serve to revive the ancient
practice of putting the loser to the sword,”
and he made a further point that others
also have put forward; “It may only be
guessed how quickly the threat of this
development will cause political and mili-
tary leaders to forget the orthodox laws
of war, as being of no danger to persons
whose fate already hangs on military
victory.”
Mr. Price also argued that, over much
the same period that Germany was en-
gaged in the wars of aggression figuring
in the Nuremberg indictment, Russia was
also engaged in wars of aggression,
against Rumania, Poland, Lithuania,
Latvia, etc., but, he added, “Russia won
her wars in the end ; her leaders now re-
main in power, enjoy all the original
fruits of conquest, and help direct the
trials of her defeated enemies.”
“Very Dangerous Territory”
N.Y. “Times'’ writer Arthur Krock
mentioned in his column that the Ameri-
can Bar Association had been much con-
cerned over the prospect that in the trials
“the majesty of the law will be dethroned
if post-war vengeance is permitted to be
wreaked blindly and without restraints,”
and, on the specific charges, an article in
London “Fortnightly,” signed “Lawyer,”
stated;
By its specification of the three main cate-
gories of charges the London Agreement has
ventured into new but also very dangerous terri-
tory.
Two of the categories, the Crimes against
Peace and the Crimes against Humanity, go
definitely beyond the existing sanctions of inter-
national law.
In the first category, the “planning, prepara-
tion, initiation or waging of a war of aggres-
or a war in violation of international
treaties, agreements or assurances” has a broad
legal basis not only in the League Covenant
but also in the Kellogg Pact for the Renuncia-
tion of War. This is a twofold revolutionary
advance. Firstly, it provides the sanction of
criminal law for preparing aggressive war;
secondly, it makes the individual, instead of the
corporate entity, responsible. This is a fascinat-
ing and wholesome return to the days when
kings and leaders fought, conquered or fell in
battle. But it is unquestionably not based dn
existing international law.
The writer said that, while the trials
against the minor war criminals follow
accepted rules, “the trials against the
major war criminals largely break new
ground. In extending responsibility to
those in charge of the State, whether they
have signed decrees, shot persons, pulled
the wires behind the scene or made profits
out of the war, and in declaring as indi-
vidual offences acts which have not so
far been attended by legal sanctions, let
alone international punishment, new
vistas are opened.” He added that if the
victors adopted “the detested principles
of the Nazi regime... .the trials will be
just another show of power... .which
may one day recoil upon those who now
sit in judgment.”
The Trials Justified
In London “Fortnightly” Viscount
Sankey made a point in justification of
the trials: “That there is no precedent for
their punishments is not an argument for
contending that unprecedented war crimes
should go unpunished.”
Also, “Collier’s” (U.S.A.) commented
in an editorial: “It is not difficult to
understand the uneasy feelings of many
Americans and Englishmen as German
and Japanese leaders go to trial in Allied
Courts for alleged war crimes. These
defendants—Yamashita, Tojo, Goring,
Ribbentrop, Funk, Streicher and the rest
—were fighting according to their lights
while the war was on. You can argue
with considerable justice that these trials
have an ex post facto tinge which violates
American and British principles of law.
However, the murders and other atroci-
ties which these men are charged with
committing, ordering or allowing to
be committed by their subordinates
have for generations been crimes under
the laws of all countries calling them-
selves civilised. It seems to us that this
fact justifies these trials in the eyes of
ordinary people, whatever the technical
objections to them may be.”
“Collier’s” made a further comment
frequently met with, in one form and an-
other, in the discussions of the trials:
“The idea back of these war trials is to
establish it as a world-wide rule that it is
an international crime to start a war, and
that therefore you had better be 100 per
cent, sure of winning before you start
one, or you’ll lose your life or your
liberty if the winners can catch you be-
fore you take poison.”
On the point made by “Collier’s” and
many others, that the trials could serve
as a deterrent to future aggressors, a
writer in Washington “Post,” Wesley M.
Bagby, commented “It is stated that in
any case the trials and executions will
serve as a ghastly deterrent to future
would-be aggressors. However, it was a
barbarian custom for centuries to execute
one’s conquered foes, which did not
noticeably decrease the number or fre-
quency of wars. Nations do not usually
enter a war with the idea of losing it.”
Among other doubts about the trials,
the N.Y. “Times” mentioned that the
“misgivings of some American military
circles” had been expressed by the un-
official “Army and Navy Journal,” which
had charged Mr. Justice Jackson, the
American prosecutor, with “attempting to
convict professional soldiers as criminals
on the ground of membership in high
commands or general staff.” The “Army
and Navy Journal” had declared that this
was “contrary to law and civilised prac-
tice,” and that it should be condemned
by the American Government “lest it
discourage men of ability and experience
from becoming officers.”
That brought a reply from Murray C.
Bernays, a New York lawyer, who was
a member of the U.S. Army General
Staff, “The German military personnel
who are being prosecuted at Nuremberg,”
he wrote, “are not being prosecuted ‘on
the ground of membership of high com-
mands and general staffs.’ They are
being prosecuted because they saw fit to
play the dual role of soldier and poli-
tician, and in the latter role were as
deeply implicated as Hitler and Goring
themselves in planning and making wars
which were aggressive in their intention,
treacherous in their inception and ruth-
less in their execution.”
On that point (and proof regarding it)
would turn, of course, the cases of Jodi,
Keitel and one or two others. Degrees
of guilt could also be involved, N.Y.
“Times” questioning; “Is Hess, who fled
tb Scotland in 1941, as guilty as Goring?
Is Schacht, the renegade banker, as guilty
as the cynical Ribbentrop? Does
Streicher, the vile anti-Semitic propa-
gandist, belong in the same cell with
Generals Keitel and Jodi, or Seyss-
Inquart, the traitor and bully, side by
side with Admiral Raeder?”
That aspect was also considered by
Raymond Moley in “Wall-street Journal”:
Here is a group of defendants who, in one
way or another, promoted the purposes of the
Fiihrer. The Fiihrer intended, by one means
or another, to carry on aggression. The move-
ment or conspiracy thus set in motion a series
of actions which brought on a war. In that
war, illegal acts were performed. Hence, guilt
for what happened in the war is attached to all
those who participated in the original Nazi
movement. It may be that Schacht murdered
no prisoners' and tortured no Jews. As a matter
of fact, he did not even have authority to order
such acts. But he helped to promote the cata-
clysm which included such acts and he helped
knowingly and voluntarily. Hence, he shares
the guilt.
It is important to keep this in mind, be-
cause there are many Americans and English-
men who view the ex post facto angles of this
prosecution with great misgivings. They say
that membership in the Nazi movement was not
a crime under any law in thp beginning. Hence,
to call it a criminal conspiracy after the act is
a violation of Anglo-American justice. But
considering all the evidence, the original Nazi
movement was, in fact, an act of aggression
against nations with which Germany had bound
itself in legal obligations. Hence, the form of
indictment has saved, in great measure, the
principles of our law.
The most widely quoted point of justi-
fication for the trials made by American
prosecutor Mr. Justice Jackson has been
that the accused have not been tried “for
having lost the war, but for having started
it.” The strongest justification for the
Tribunal, however, was probably that
made by the British Attorney-General,
Sir Hartley Shawcross, in his opening
address at Nuremberg on December 4.
As reported in London “Times”;
This Tribunal, acting as we know it will act
notwithstanding its appointment by the vic-
torious Powers, with complete and judicial
objectivity, will provide a contemporary touch-
stone and an authoritative and impartial record
to which future historians may turn for truth
and future politicians for warning. From this
record all generations shall know not only what
our generations suffered, hut also that our
suffering was the result of crimes against the
laws of peoples which the peoples of the world
enforced and will continue in the future to
uphold by international co-operation, not based
merely on military alliances but firmly grounded
in the rule of law.
It was the view of the British Government,
Sir Hartley Shawcross continued, that the Tri-
bunal would apply to individuals not the law
of the victor but the accepted principles of in-
ternational usage in a way which would, if any-
thing could, promote and fortify the rule of
international law and safeguard the future peace
and security of this war-stricken world.
It was not difficult to be misled by such
phrases as that resort to war in the past had
not been a crime and that the present pro-
ceedings were no more than a measure of ven-
geance, subtly concealed in the garb of judicial
proceedings, which the victor wreaked upon the
vanquished. It was not necessary to doubt
that some aspects of the charter of the Tribunal
bore the imprint of significant and salutary
novelty. But fundamentally the provision of
the charter which constituted such wars as the
defendants joined in waging and planning a
crime was not in any way an innovation. That
provision did no more than constitute a com-
petent jurisdiction for the punishment of what
not only the enlightened conscience of mankind
but the law of nations itself constituted an in-
ternational crime before this Tribunal was estab-
lished and this charter became part of the
public law of the world.
Fairness to the Accused
Referring to the danger that the trials
might be used “as precedent by cynical
conquerors not only to liquidate the
vanquished, but to shift guilt from them-
selves to their victims,” N.Y. “Times”
commented that the Tribunal could guard
against that “if it metes out justice whose
fairness is beyond challenge.”
A writer in London “Fortnightly,” P.
H. Winfield, stated that “the rules of
procedure and evidence laid down by
the charter [of the Tribunal] are of great
interest because every one of them is
designed to secure a fair trial for the
accused.” He added: “The essence of
any fair trial is that the accused shall
have full notice of what he is charged
with and shall be given the opportunity
of raising every relevant point in his
defence; the charter makes ample pro-
vision for satisfying both these requisites.”
As to the fairness at Nuremberg, Mr.
Winfield stated that “in particular it is
noteworthy that the bulk of the evidence
put forward by the prosecution is sup-
plied by documents captured from the
Germans, which are of German origin.”

correspondent at Nuremberg reported

SHOE POLISH
how the accused had heard the President
of the Tribunal, Lord Justice Sir Geoffrey
Lawrence, “rule out a sensational Hitler
speech and deliver some sharp remarks
on the prosecution’s mishandling of docu-
ments.” The speech in question was in-
troduced by the American prosecution
and would have been most damning evi-
dence against Goring.
Also regarding the fairness of the
trials, German defence counsel were
flown to London to examine British
Admiralty records; a Scripps-Howard
representative reported that the U.S.
Army was “scouring Germany to pro-
duce defence witnesses... .this is just one
point in the trials which bear many
aspects of a laboratory for democracy’s
diplomacy and fair play” ; and American
prosecutor Mr. Justice Jackson was re-
ported in N.Y. “Times” as stating in the
Court that “more was being done for the
defendants in the way of providing them
with transcripts and documents than any
accused citizen of the United States
might reasonably expect from a Court of
his own country.” “Presiding Justice
Lawrence,” the N.Y. “Times” man also
noted, “has insisted throughout that the
accused must*be confronted with every
word of evidence against them, and that
their lawyers must have the fullest oppor-
tunity to confer with clients and cross-
examine witnesses.”
“The whole proceeding,” according to
the same reporter, “is carried on without
any trace of bitterness or vindictiveness
on the part of the prosecution.”
This must be said to differ considerably
from a good deal of reporting of the
trials. Only occasional bits and pieces
have been published in Australia over
the months, but fairly extensive reports
have appeared in Britain and America.
They have, however, been more in the
nature of comments on the proceedings
than the usual sort of Court reporting.
Even London “Times” reports, though
among the fairest published, have carried
a good deal of comment, as one typical
example will sufficiently show: “Six
months of Nuremberg have not produced
a keener clash of wits than today’s [May
20] cross-examination by Sir David Max-
well Fyfe of Raeder, whose defence, after
hours of involved reasoning in the
witness-box, was at last brought out in
its cold cynicism—one might say in its
essential Germanism.”
Anyone following the evidence over the
months of the trials must have been
struck by the abundance of documents
at the prosecution’s command —the great
bulk of them authentic German docu-
ments of such a nature as to make any-
one wonder why they were ever compiled
or why they were not destroyed. As a
N.Y. “Times” reporter wrote of them:
“The German passion for keeping diaries
and records has served the world well.
One of the most amazing things about the
trials is the wealth of documentary
material that is available for presentation
as proof of each step in the whole mon-
strous plot.”
The Accused
On the personal side of Nuremberg, a
N.Y. “Times” correspondent reported, in
regard to the most sorely-missed absentee,
that it was being demonstrated that
“Hitler, far from being the hare-brained
follower of soothsayers which one school
of thought believed him to be, was really
possessed of a kind of satanic shrewdness
and was much better informed on matters
of policy and strategy than some of his
lieutenants. His judgments have been
shown to have been pretty accurate.”

Reichsmarshal Hermann Goring. —Former
commander of the German Air Force, general of
the Elite Guard, successor-designate to Hitler.,

Gcring’s Defence
The stand of Goring before the Tri-
bunal was practically one of defiance.
When he began his defence the Court,
said London “Times” report, gave him
“full freedom of expression, and there is
no denying that, with his life at stake, he
made the most remarkable speech of his
career.” 1
“It was ridiculous,” Goring said, “to
think that the Nazi leaders conspired for
decades ahead ; war came, as it always
did, from the grouping of the Powers.”
London “Times” reported that
“Gbrmg’s fellow-prisoners... .followed
him with rapt attention, and some of
them, notably Hess, seemed to be carried
away by his eloquence.” The report
added:—
There were no flourishes about Goring in the
box, no purple patches or heated voice.
Nothing could be more disarmingly frank than
his full acceptance of responsibility tor ms
actions, for building up the Luftwaffe, for the
fining of the Jews, and for the annexation of
Austria. Nothing must besmirch the name of
Hitler, but he was careful to imply that the
Fiihrer insisted on complete freedom of decision,
and that no one, after all, could oppose him.
Gdrine said that democracy came to Ger-
many when the nation was at rock bottom:
the authority was with the masses and responsi-
bility with the leaders. Under the leadership
principle the authority was at the top working
downwards, and the responsibility at the bottom
working upwards. Certainly all foreign Gov-
ernments had recognised the Hitler regime and
the entire diplomatic corps came to the Nurem-
berg rallies.
As for the Jews, soldiers returning from the
last' war found them flaunting themselves, hold-
ing all the key positions in business and indus-
try, and they had certainly said and written
things about the Nazis as bad as the Nazis had
said about them.
The prisoner admitted that he had pressed
Hitler fo aid Franco at all costs in the Spanish
civil war, if only as a means of testing his air-
craft and pilots. As supreme commander of
the Luftwaffe there was nothing he had left
undone for its development.
“Whatever the fate of Goring,” the
London “Times” representative later com-
mented, “there is no denying the extra-
ordinary breadth of mind, the evasive
sublety with which he has sought to
counter charges against him His grasp
of detail and choice of words in dealing
with every aspect of this monumental in-
dictment have been quite astonishing.”
From London “Times” reports:
Goring repeated his views on the unwisdom
of the Russian campaign, but when asked by
counsel why he did not warn the German
people or protect his name in history by resign-
ing he replied with heat that his country was
at war, which made it impossible to bring
opposing views on strategy before the public,
and that as an officer he was serving his country
and the man to whom he had given an oath
of loyalty. Hitler, he affirmed, would have
been ready to negotiate had negotiations left
him any sort of hope. The declaration by the
Western Powers after the landing in North
Africa that they would accept only unconditional
surrender merely stiffened German resistance.
Questioned about the defence of German cities
against air attack, Goring said; “Thank heavens
we still had one weapon. As long as the fight
was going on we had to give return blows, and
as a soldier 1 can only regret that we had not
enough V weapons, which perhaps would have
brought an easing of the attacks on our cities.”
To counsel’s suggestion that for the people of
Germany the only means of stopping the war
was revolution or the assassination of Hitler,
he answered with a deprecating smile that revo-
lution always changed a situation if it was suc-
cessful, and that the murder of Hitler would
have brought him in as Hitler’s successor. If
he were then faced with the same demand for
unconditional surrender he would have gon# on
fighting to the last breath. ' ,
Mr. Justice Jackson pointed out that Hitler s
will appointing. Donitz as his successor had
charged Goring and Himmler with secretly ne-
gotiating with the enemy, and with attempting
to seize power themselves, at which the prisoner
expressed his grief that, through a mistake in
transmission and possibly a wrong picture given
by Bormann, the Fiihrer in his last hours could
believe that he, Goring, was disloyal.
Goring described how he had sworn himself
to the Fiihrer. After he came to know him
and his personality he gave him his hand,
affirming: “I wish to unite my fate with yours,
come what may, for better or for worse. I am
ready to answer for it with my head.” “And
that,” exclaimed the prisoner, “still holds good
in this Court today.” *
Mr. Justice Jackson took him into the de-
tails of the German rearmament programme and
of his relations with Schacht as commissar for
the four-year plan. He did not want war, but
saw the best possibility of avoiding it in pos-
sessing strong armaments on the calculation that
“he who has a strong sword has peace.” “I
am more than ever of that opinion today,” said
Goring with a wry smile and a quick glance at
his judges, “when I see the complications that
are now arising in the world.”
“Do you still glorify the Fiihrer after he had
murdered these 50 young flying officers from
Stalag Luff III?” Sir David Maxwell Fyfe asked
Goring. The prisoner retorted that he was
not there to excuse Hitler or to glorify him.
He was" pledged to him in bad as in good days,
but he had never contradicted him so sharply
as over the shooting of R.A.F. officers, and on
that account there had been no conversation be-
tween them for months.
Summing up on Goring, the London
“Times” representative said that he “never
lost command of himself, and if nothing
but his subtlety and powers of reasoning
were involved he would leave the
box a far bigger figure than when he
entered it.”
Hess and Ribbentrop
Hess decided not to go into the witness-
box ; his defence, said the London
“Times” report, “had the same air of un-
reality that has pervaded this man of
shadows since he came down by para-
chute on a May night in Scotland.”
Counsel tried to show that Hess flew to
Scotland with the best of intentions, but
an examination of the interview with him
in which Lord Simon and Mr. Kirk-
patrick of the Foreign Office took part
“clearly proved that the terms he pre-
sented amounted to blackmail. If Britain
refused to accept them, so much the
worse for her. She would be mercilessly
destroyed ; and if the Government sought
to continue the struggle from the Empire
the population of the British Empire
would be left to starve.” The terms, said
the London “Times” report,
were nothing but an extension of those brought
to London by Herr Dahlerus on Goring’s be-
half on the eve of the war —an agreement that
Britain would take no further interest in the
affairs of Continental Europe, in return for a
similar 1 undertaking from Germany about the
Empire; the return of the former German
colonies; a vague reference to Germany’s re-
luctance to leave Iraq in the lurch, and on.
Hess, purporting to have come without Hitler s
knowledge, made sinister references to the grow-
ing volume of Germany’s air fleets and the ines-
capable menace of the submarine campaign.
He pictured an endless row of children’s coffins
with mothers crying behind them. ...
Lord Simon, at one juncture, gently reminded
him that the British people, and the Cabinet,
too, were a Herrenvolk who did not take kindly
to threats, and the air of polite derision with
which Hess’s blusterings were received is
apparent throughout the document.
A Manchester “Guardian” report de-
scribed Ribbentrop as “a shadow of the
man who strutted across the diplomatic
history of Europe during the years of
Nazi domination more than any of
the prisoners he looked a broken man
his voice faltered as he took the oath,
and under the glare of the footlights there
was something inexpressibly tired and
hunted in his whole bearing.”
“It had seemed likely,” the London
“Times” man thought, “that, taking a
lead from Goring, the accused, with their
defending counsel, had entered into a
pact of loyalty to the memory of the
Fiihrer, but Ribbentrop’s first witness, to
the obvious disgust of Goring, tried to
cast all the blame on Hitler and the other
dead men round him.”
That line of defence was, in fact, taken
in most of the cases that followed. In
Ribbentrop’s case it was stated that “on
Goebbels’s advice Hitler ordered the exe-
cution of 10,000 British and American
airmen in retaliation for the bombing of
Dyesden, and was dissuaded from this
massacre only on Ribbentrop’s interven-
tion.” According to his counsel, Ribben-
trop “knew extraordinarily little about

LIFE ASSURANCE
No man should so overload himself with
$
assurance that the payment of premiums
may become an embarrassment during his
lifetime.
On the other hand, no man —at least no
man with a dependent family—can afford
to sit back complacently with too little life
assurance. Indeed, the amount of life
assurance that you should have is of
utmost importance. It is YOUR responsi-
bility to see that the total of your policies
will be sufficient to afford your family the
protection that they will need, should the
emergency arise.
Now is the time to make provision for the
future. Not necessarily protection against
the possibility of death only, but provision
for all manner of purposes; the home you
intend to build; education for your family;
financial independence in your old age.
You can provide for these things with Life
Assurance. . .Whole of Life Assurance
payable at death, and Endowment Assur-
ance payable at a determined date or at
previous death.
Examine your situation now, and decide
how much assurance of both forms you
should have!
A City Mutual Service
City Mutual will welcome the opportunity
of assisting you in your assurance prob-
lems. Our officers will explain the advan-

AGE AT THE HELM.
The Commonwealth has had eight Labor
Administrations. The first, Watson’s, and
the second, Fisher’s, took office without
a majority in either Chamber and were
turned out before they had had a chance
to prove their quality; Watson’s in 81
days, Fisher’s in less than seven months.
On April 13, 1910, the electors gave their
party, still led by Fisher, command-
ing majorities in both Chambers, and
there ensued for three years the most
active and successful Labor Govern-
ment Australia has known.
When it was obliged to resign on June
24, 1913, Australia had the Common-
wealth Bank, old-age and invalid pensions
and maternity bonuses. What was more
important with an international storm
beating up, Australia was possessed of a
serviceable R.A.N., a naval college, Dun-
troon (opened in June, 1911) and the
makings of a fine army planned to con-
sist of 92 battalions of infantry, 56 bat-
teries of field artillery and 28 regiments
of light horse, plus special units, and
based on universal liability to training
and service. Compulsory training had
been ushered in by proclamation on
January 1, 1911. In the pensions and the
provisions for naval and military defence
the Liberals co-operated; indeed, the
principle of universal liability to training
had been established (“for the first time in
any English-speaking community”
Commonwealth Year-Book ) by an Act of
1909, passed when Deakin was Prime
Minister, and it was that last Deakin
Government which brought Lord Kit-
chener to Australia. But no one can deny
the Fisher Government the credit for in-
troducing what the Scullin Government
was to ditch.
In Fisher’s time Ministers were expected
to earn their salaries and to give the
people value for every pound taken from
them in taxes, and these Ministers ful-
filled the specifications. When they took
office there were only eight of Cabinet
rank and two Ministers without port-
folio, Findley and Frazer. Frazer was 30.
Fisher was 48, and Hughes, his No. 2,
was 46. Of the others, Pearce became
Minister of Defence at 40; Tudor
(Customs) was 44, Batchelor (External
Affairs) was 45 and Thomas (P.M.G.) 47.
The oldest Minister by many years was
McGregor, 61, who was named Vice-
President of the Executive Council, with
leadership of the Senate. When Batchelor
died in 1911 Frazer was promoted to
P.M.G., Thomas going to External
Affairs. The new honorary was Roberts,
who was in the early thirties.
What a change has come over the
scene with the Chifleys! We now see
not youth but age “at the helm,” and
there is no “pleasure at the prow.”
Mr, Ward (Transport and External
Territories), who may claim to be the
baby of the Ministry, is rising 48. The
other unspanked child in office, Mr.
Calwell (Immigration and Information), is
just on 50. Mr. Chifley, now older than
any of his predecessors, from Barton to
Curtin, will turn 61 in election-week. His
principal adviser in the House, who at
any time since 1941 could have had a
portfolio for the asking, is Mr. Scullin,
70 next month. His counsellor and
Nestor of debate in the Senate is Mr.
Collings, still a Minister of State (actually
Vice-President of the Executive Council),
who will never see 80 again.
Among Ministers with portfolios there
are Mr. Forde (Army), Mr. Drakeford
(Air) and Mr. Dedman (Post-War Recon-
struction), all in the fifties; Mr.
Don Cameron (P.M.G.) and Mr.
Ashley (Supply and Shipping), who
both served in a war that ended on
May 31, 1902 ; and Mr. Holloway (Labor
and National Service). Mr. Holloway is
a bit sensitive about his years, but is
long past the retiring age in his depart-
ment ; it is 18 years since he gave up a
Melbourne Trades Hall job because the
duties had become too burdensome for
him at his time of life. Mr. Lazzarini
(Works and Housing), the effusive builder
of imaginary homes, is ,59. Mr. Scully
(Commerce and Agriculture) is 56 accord-
ing to Who’s Who, but the “Labor Daily' ’
Year-Book, published when Mr. Scully
was a devoted supporter of Mr. Lang,
says he was born on February 1, 1885.
In any case, his ideas and methods are
antediluvian, and whether he pays land
men for not growing wheat in good sea-
sons or whether, in the name of “stabi-
lisation” or “orderly marketing,” he an-
nexes part of their profits on sales of
compulsorily delivered wheat and wool
when a bad season comes and they need
every penny fatality seems to attend all
his proceedings. It would almost seem
that a Higher Power, working through
Nature, is punishing Australia for having
so stupid' and conscienceless a Govern-
ment.
Taken by and large, the Ministry is far
too old, and its inordinate allotment of
age cannot be dissociated from its
habitual inertia where action is required,
and its drivelling complacency in the
presence of the preventible chaos in
transport and industry and in the build-
ing trades. Old Ministers, especially old
Labor Ministers, tend to take the line of
least resistance, and to imagine that all
is for the best in the best of all worlds
because they are in office. There have
been politicians who in spirit, purpose
and capacity for work were younger
than their years ; but not these politi-
cians.
One of the prime needs of the times has
been Ministerial resistance to and the
assertion of law against the Communist
larrikinism which has brought the country
to a sorry pass without precedent in its
history. None has been forthcoming
from “poor old Holloway.” Banging of
an Evatt fist on the table may be all
very well at Paris. It has on no occasion
been seen or heard at Canberra, though
there have been countless provocations.
Energy in the provision of farms and
houses for returned fighting men was
called for, especially as promises of both
were lavish. It has never been placed at
the service of the young men to whom
the promises were made by the old boys
responsible.
These elderly duds, nominees of a
Caucus in which there are 21 Ms.H.R.
from N. S. Wales, have had as N.S.W.
associates Mr. McGirr, a bright young
man of 55 whose forte was supposed to
be housing, and who works himself into a
great state of. self-admiration when a
house is built, and Mr. Tully, who, as
Secretary for Lands, was charged with
the special duty of providing about 20,000
servicemen ‘ with farms. Like his leader,
Mr. McKell, Mr. Tully had become a
gentleman farmer of substance in the
Goulburn district, and prospective
soldier-settlers hoped that a fellow-
feeling would make these worthies
wondrous kind. And if words were
farms, the 20,000 would have been pro-
vided for in the first post-war year, now
completed.
Mr. Tully began gassing about what he
Was going to do for soldier-settlers in the
middle of 1941, when he was called to
office. He was 55 then. In the ensuing
five years he had numerous conferences
on soldier-settlement with the gentlemen
at Canberra —Labor Ministers are whales
for conferences, and they rarely come to
anything. Turned 60, he felt a pressing
call to the London office at £3OOO a year
for five years, leaving the soldier-settle-
ment business to his colleague Mr. Dunn.
Before leaving for London, where he, will
celebrate his 61st birthday on December
1, Mr, Tully said something about having
satisfied or being about to satisfy the
ambitions of a few score soldier-settle-
ments ; he gave several sets of conflict-
ing figures. Challenged by the Sydney
“Morning Herald” to name “a single re-
turned serviceman who” had been
“placed on a property he may one day
call his own,” Mr. Tully went on packing,
having in the meantime “qualified” for a
life pension of £6 a week under his Gov-
ernment’s Parliamentary Pensions Act by
paying a few pounds into the fund, which
politicians of his own kidney are to con-
trol.
Mr. Dunn’s first statement to prospec-
tive soldier-settlers had a gloomy note.
He said it would be “years” before they
could be accommodated. Long before
that time Mr. Dunn will doubtless have
retired on his £6 a week, to which there
is to be tacked on in every instance
£3 a week for widows, even widows of
Assemblymen whose “service” runs to
seven years spread over three State
Parliaments. They will be privileged to
claim £5 a week —provided in all cases
that taxpayers, who were given no fore-
warning of the raid on the public purse,
behave like dumb-driven cattle. Mr,
Dunn is 69. His colleague Baddeley, who
is to share responsibility for the admini-
stration of the coal-control measure with
some congenial spirit at Canberra—“poor
old Holloway,” perhaps—is approaching
64.
One of Labor’s greatest appeals in the
past was that it was the party of youth
opposed to crabbed age, all the elderly
politicians, it asserted, being on the other
side. The tables have been turned with
a vengeance.
Nowadays the Opposition has the only
members, Mr. Turnbull and Mr. Gullett,
who came to grips with the late enemies
in the front line—the gallant Blain is in
a special category, being voteless —and
each of its groups has plenty of young
servicemen on its list of candidates. The
one Labor member who can claim any
form of combat service is Mr. Maxie Fal-
stein, and, unlike Mr. Gullett and Mr.
Turnbull, Mr. Falstein is not made of
Ministerial timber. His successful appli-
cation for a licence to import Swiss
watches (he is a lawyer) suggests a lively
apprehension on the part of all con-
cerned in the transaction that he and his
electorate and Caucus are about to part
company. Whereas all the services are
strongly represented in the British Labor
party, Federal Labor will be a party with-
out servicemen, except possibly for an
army dentist and a gentleman who was
an aircraftman for a few months. To
return this Government is to return a
parcel of tired old Ministers who are
living in the past —bemused by their
memories of the conscription campaigns
and the 1917 strike—who are out of
touch with this generation, let alone the
future, and whose tails go down when-
ever a Communist boss appears.
Moscow to Canberra.
Doubtless with the Commonwealth
elections in mind, the Soviet Propaganda
Department is flooding Australia with
pamphlets. The distribution of this out-
put is so lavish and so —er —impartial
that The Bulletin itself has been placed
on the Moscow mailing list.
A choice production deals with the
fourth Five-Year Plan, the one for “the
»Rehabilitation and Development of the
National Economy of the U.S.S.R., 1946-
1950,” and in the opening chapters re-
cent history is rewritten.
As a result of the heroic efforts of the
peoples of the Soviet Union and of its
gallant Red Army an epoch-making victory
has been won. Hiller Germany has been
smashed and Japanese imperialism defeated.
The U.S.S.R. ended the war by completely
vanquishing the enemy.
The victory of the U.S.S.R. means, firstly,
a victory for the Soviet social system;
secondly, a victory for the Soviet State
system; thirdly, a victory for the Soviet
armed forces, the Red Army; the Red
Army has withstood all the hardships of
war, completely vanquished the armies of
our enemies and emerged from the war
victorious.
Not a word about the parts borne by the
British Commonwealth, the United States,
Poland, the Netherlands, Norway, Greece
or any other belligerent. No mention of
Dunkirk, the Battle of Britain, the British
Navy, the Royal Air Force, the U.S.A.F.,
El Alamein, the invasions of North-west
Africa, Sicily, Italy, France and the Low
Countries, the atom bomb, or, indeed, any
form of assistance from any quarter.
Shod, clothed, fed and equipped wholly
by Russian effort, the Red Army did all
the fighting and won all the battles single-
handed, “because the whole country had
been made ready lor active defence be-
forehand.”
Perhaps a copy of this pamphlet was
placed in the hands of the US. State
Secretary while Molotov was performing
at Paris. Anyway, Mr. Byrnes was baited
into reminding Stalin’s understudy—or
one of Stalin’s understudies—that “when
Russia’s back was to the wall the United
States came to her aid.” He added that
“we have only admiration and respect
for the Russian people, and we will not
let that be changed by any attacks by
Mr.. Molotov, who has misrepresented tne
position of the United States.”
Almost at the same time Admiral
Okada, a former Japanese Premier,
accused the Russian Government of hav-
ing prolonged the war in the Pacific, and
that during its long neutrality, to secure
bloodless gains for itself; in effect, a re-
turn to the East Asian empire of the
Tsars, with re-entry to Port Arthur and
Dairen and with a commanding position
in China added. According to Okada,
Soviet officials knew six months before
Russia entered the Pacific war —which it
did exactly 10 days before the end —that
Japan wanted to give in, a Japanese
Foreign Office official having so informed
the Soviet Ambassador at Tokyo in
February. This overture and others
made through the Japanese Ambassador
at Moscow, and even carried to Potsdam
when Molotov was there, were never
answered, directly or indirectly, till Russia
renounced its neutrality agreement with
Japan and subscribed with Britain and
the United States to the Potsdam Declara-
tion. If any fighting was done in Man-
churia by the Red Army which “com-
pletely” vanquished “Japanese imperi-
alism” it was over in two days. The
looting began immediately and was of
vast dimensions.
The fourth Five-Year Plan pamphlet
gives glowing accounts of the agri-
cultural and industrial miracles pro-
jected for the Byelorussian and
Ukrainian “Soviet Socialist Repub-
lics,” and since the plans were
adopted at “the session of the Supreme
Soviet on March 18” they should now be
well under way. Unfortunately for the
people of these “republics,” a beginning
had not been made when the Australian
Colonel Jackson, now chief lieutenant to
Mr. La Guardia, arrived in the Common-
wealth a couple of months ago with a
report on their frightful condition, made
through A.8.C.:
In the Ukraine and Byelorussia, where
our U.N.R.R.A. missions are working,
there are still nearly 25,000,000 people with-
out 'houses. They are forced to live very
largely in holes in the ground.
And this two years after the Ukraine and
White Russia were abandoned by the
enemy. Something must have gone wrong
with the marvellous Communist efficiency
of which so much has been heard for so
many years. It should be said that
Colonel Jackson praised the stoical
courage of the Ukrainians and White
Russians and the good use they have
made of the housing materials and farm-
rehabilitation plant provided by the
English-speaking countries —all capitalist,
of course. But a later U.N.R.R.A. report
compiled for presentation to a conference
at Geneva on August 5 shows that the
unhappy victims of Hun barbarism and
the Communist scorched-earth policy (re-
commended by idiots to Australia in
1942) are still in a desperate plight:
The entire territory from Minsk to Mos-
cow, 400 miles, is a desert. Every town is
practically destroyed, and 10,000,000 White
Russians lack clothing, footwear, shelter,
medical supplies and equipment. There is
no food except cereals.
Yet production of everything should
now be going forward under the Five-
Year Plan, which is a mass of imposing
figures and resolutions, all emphasised
by the word “shall.” The same is true of
the plans for the Ukraine, but
U.N.R.R.A. found similar conditions
there.
Hospitals without soap. Never enough
food to supply even a fraction of the
ration. Average consumption of meat does
not exceed-a pound per month per person.
In towns which before the war had popu-
lations of 100,000 only half the people have
survived, and they are living mostly in
cellars and sheds.
It is interesting in a melancholy way to
compare this harrowing picture with the
1946-50 Communist prospectus for the
Ukraine:
Production of undressed timber in 1946-
50 shall be set at 47,600,000 cubic metres.
The crop area shall amount to 30,500,000
hectares. Quantify of livestock: 2,629,000
horses, 12,230,000 head of cattle, 6,780,000
sheep and goats, 9,600,000 pigs. Coal out-
put shall be brought up to 86,100,000 tons;
9,000,000 tons of pig-iron; 8,400,000 tons of
steel; 6,500,000 tons of finished rolled
goods. Capacity of the electric power stations
shall be increased by 2,547,000 k.w. Out-
put of the food industries shall be in-
creased to a value of 4400 million roubles:
55 meat-packing plants; 46 milk factories;
100 butter and cheese factories; 60,000
motor-trucks to be produced annually and
two motor-car assembly plants to be built;
soda, nitrate and super, plants; cement,
glass, brick, lime and tile works; metal
fixtures, prefabricated houses, building sec-
tions, plumbing fixtures, roofing materials
and high-tensile gypsum; 29,045 schools;
173,100 hospital beds. And 15,920,000
square metres of housing accommodation
to be made available for occupation in the
period 1946-50.
No doubt the U.N.R.R.A. leaders are
fully acquainted with this Communist
programme. Their opinion of it may
be judged from the fact that they have
“decided to ship into the Ukraine and
Byelorussia 559,000 tons of supplies,
estimated to cost £62,000,000 sterling.”
This will be the second great U.N.R.R.A.
gift to the two “republics,” and as before
it will be supplied and financed in the
main by the English-speaking “imperialist”
nations. To the end of 1945 U.S.A. had
contributed to U.N.R.R.A. in money and
goods the equivalent of £675,000,000
sterling. The British contribution from a
hard-pressed people, itself now on a bread
and flour ration, amounted to
£156,000,000 sterling. Canada’s was
reckoned at £34,700,000, Australia’s at
£9,600,000 and New Zealand’s at
£2,000,000.
The poor people of the Ukraine and
White Russia are voiceless, and though
gratitude may be felt by them it is not
expressed, even at U.N.O. conferences
and the like, at which their alleged
representatives throw their weight
about. None can be expected from
Moscow or from “Australian” Commu-
nists, who remain as bold as brass.
Their poisonous press is criticising Dr.
Evatt for his change of front at the Paris
Peace Conference, but in terms signifi-
cantly mild. “Australian” Communists
cannot forget Dr. Evatt’s defence of the
Soviet “annexations” —made in repudi-
ation of the Atlantic Charter, of
which he chatters so much —during
his last visit to Australia or the
other favors they have received
from him, beginning with his release of
the convicted Communist conspirators
Ratliff and Thomas; his removal of the
Menzies ban on Communist organisations
and publications, imposed when Com-
munists were sabotaging the Australian
war effort against Stalin’s pal, and his
refusal to restore it when they had
violated their undertaking to abstain from
sabotaging industry ; and his acceptance
meanwhile of a Communist powers-
referendum alliance. On his part this
was carried to the length of speaking
at a Yes “rally,” at which a Communist
was “chief marshal” and a fellow-
speaker was a Communist union secre-
tary who, in April, 1940, had, at *
meeting of union bosses, “demandedjhe^


immediate cessation of hostilities, the
return of Australian soldiers from
abroad and the negotiation of a peace
settlement” —which would have left Hitler
and Stalin masters of Europe, and the
Japanese supreme in East Asia, except for
the regions left to Soviet imperialism
under the Russo-Jap. pact negotiated in
the ensuing year.
Though the Federal A.L.P. executive
has made a show of rejecting a Com-
munist proposal for “some understand-
ing,” all the signs are that the Com-
munists will again be Labor’s election and
referendum allies. So far from acting
on its sweeping anti-Communist declara-
tions at its recent annual conference, the
Sydney A.L.P. executive has endorsed
Mrs. Jessie Street as Labor candidate for
Wentworth, though the lady is a Heroine
(Second Class) of the U.S.S.R. and is pre-
sident of the Australian-Russian Associa-
tion, and Mr. Kenny, a member of the
A.L.P. executive and president of the
Labor Council, has spoken from a Domain
platform with Sharkey, the general presi-
dent of the Communist party. And the
A.C.T.U. has ordered the “Labor” Gov-
ernment to break off diplomatic relations
with the Franco Government, as a step
towards “liquidating the Franco dictator-
ship” and to “recognise the democratic
Republican Government as the legal and
constitutional Government of Spain.” In
other words, it requires the Chifleys to
conform to Moscow policy. All this, to-
gether with the spreading chaos in trans-
port and industry and the continued Com-
munist domination of Australian foreign
policy as it concerns the Dutch, has given
Mr. Menzies too much warrant for
saying that “Labor will not quarrel
with its supporters; it prefers to
quarrel with its allies abroad and
with a growing army of discontented
citizens and their wives at home who pay
the price for lawlessness in the field of
production and for incompetence in high
places.” •
PLAIN ENGLISH
In Defence of S. Claus.
One of the New Zealand delegates to
Mrs. Jessie Street’s Chatter-Chatter Con-
ference in Sydney was accused by a Syd-
ney morning paper of having said that
“parents who teach children to believe in
Santa Claus impair their ability to think
clearly.”
The benevolent old gentleman referred
to is unlikely to be upset by this attack,
seeing that he escaped unscathed from a
brush with Mr. Dedman. He had hid%n
himself so deep in the memory of every
adult and in the heart of eyery child that
nothing Mr. Dedman could do availed to
remove him.
If the conference lady really regards
Mr. Claus as a sinister influence she is
rather ungrateful, for he earned his fame
by an initial act of kindness to three
young sisters who, having no dowry, faced
being forced into a life of shame by their
poverty-stricken parents. Hearing of their
dilemma, Mr. Claus very kindly and
secretly provided the dowries, whereupon
each obtained a husband and, it may be
presumed, lived happily ever after. That
Mr. Claus later emigrated to America
with the Dutch and subsequently travelled
to all parts of the Christian world is a
tribute to his initiative and enterprise
rather than a reflection on his character.
Since children persist in living in a
world of make-believe and possess a
magic that can turn two bits of wood
into a sailing ship or a rusty tin into a
treasure chest, it is difficult to see how
their belief in Santa Claus is likely to
impair their thinking. All of us, child
and adult, must have something in which
to believe, and it would be interesting to
know what substitute the lady proposes
for the kindhearted old party who never
fails to appear at the appointed time and
who always comes with gifts in his hands.
Real gifts, made in a spirit of affec-
tion and often entailing sacrifices, not
vulgar pre-election bribes.
Seeing the World.
“Join the Labor (or Communist) party and
see the world.” —Old gibe, brought up to date.
Having passed the maximum of ill-
considered legislation in the minimum of
time, Ms.H.R. and Senators have ended
their debates and are about to go election-
eering. In point of ability and manners,
the 17th Parliament of the Common-
wealth failed to measure up to any of its
predecessors, but in one respect it was
without a competitor. During its three
years more public money was spent on
overseas tours of politicians and poli-
ticians’ offsiders than in any three previ-
ous Parliaments.
Tours in which members of Cabinet
were engaged on the actual business of
the country can be justified, though some
of them were unnecessarily costly. Mr.
Chifley’s visit to Britain, U.S.A. and
Japan was a striking and welcome excep-
tion. It cost £753. One of his fellow-
travellers was Dr. Evatt, with officials
and staff,” their services no doubt being
at the Prime Minister’s disposal. The
Evatt party’s expenses raised the total to
£3593.
Dr. Evatt began his travels in March,
1942. His first overseas tour cost £3900 ;
his second £4217 ; his third—in which he
had four companions, Mr. Forde and 11
“assistants,” together with wives and
officials—ate up £28,171, of which £3706
was spent in taking the politicians in the
party to the Congress at Washington and
the Canadian House of Commons, as a
pleasant sequel to the U.N.O. proceedings
at San Francisco. In the meantime Dr.
Evatt and Mr. Forde, “accompanied by
their wives, officials and staff” —as was the
case on every occasion—visited New
Zealand; “£905.” Then came the trip
to London, where it was hoped that the
doctor would bustle or muscle into the
Council of Foreign Ministers, and on to
New York; “£4658.”
Mr. Curtin’s one visit to London and
Washington cost £4283. Senator Keane,
Mrs. Keane and staff went to New Zea-
land (£402), to Canada and the U.S.A.
(£2940), and to those countries* again on
the mission which ended in his death
(£3121 ; “accounts incomplete”). Mr.
Makin’s appearance in London as chair-
man of the U.N.O. Security Council cost
“about £1790,” which seems fairly frugal.
With “officials and staff,” Mr. Drakeford
visited Canada and the United States in
1944 (£5387) and again this year (“cost,
so far, £4516”),
A trip across the B Tasman for Senator

officials,” ran to £613. “About £3600”
went in taking Mr. Beasley, Mr. Barnard
and party to Philadelphia and back, and
another £l9OO in carrying “Mr. Beasley,
Mrs. Beasley, their four children, and Mr.
Callaghan, private secretary, with his wife
and two children*” plus furniture, to
London.
When Mr. Beasley went off to Phila-
delphia in the morning, with a chip in-
stead of a bundle on his shoulder (Britain
got the benefit of it), it was to attend an
International Labor Office Conference.
This I.L.p. was a twin of the League of
Nations. It has survived the League,
though what purpose it serves other than
affording a pretext for politicians’ picnics
—especially “Labor politicians from these
parts —is obscure. The 1.L.0. or perhaps
some subsidiary feels impelled to call a
conference every two or three months.
Hence these contributions to the list
tabled in the Senate at the instance of
Old Digger Collett, of Westralia.
In August, 1945, Senator Fraser and Mr.
Lawson and Mr. Haylen, Ms.H.R., went
to the 1.L.0. conference in Paris, accqm-
panied by their wives and representatives
of employees and employers and officials.
Cost, about £B5OO.
In December, 1945, Mr. James, M.H.R.,
accompanied by representatives of em-
ployees and employers, went to London
and Senator Sheehan, with staff and repre-
sentatives of employees and employers, went
to London about the same time. Cost of
the two conferences, “approximately”
£3260.
In April, 1946, Senator Finlay and Mr.
Clark, M.H.R., went to Cleveland, U.S.A.,
with representatives of employees and em-
ployers and staff. “Cost to date, about
£2400.”
That took the expenditure on “trips
abroad by members of Parliament and
others since the beginning of 1942” to
£88,516 ; but there are many items to
be added. For instance. Senator Lamp
has had a jaunt to the U.S.A.,' though
without a translator; and Senator Grant
has had a jaunt to Paris (no business
done), to Scotland to see his rela-
tions, and to Paris again as Dr.
Evatt’s “observer” or “adviser.” And
a collection of union bosses, among them
Thornton and McHenry,- from the
Communist-controlled Ironworkers Fede-
ration, have been toted to foreign coun-
tries at the taxpayers’ expense on “busi-
ness” connected with Laborism or Com-
munism or something. And another party
of politicians, representatives of em-
ployees, employers and staff headed by
Senator Ceilings, that bright young octo-
genarian, is going to another 1.L.0. con-
ference unless the electors or the incoming
Government decide otherwise.
A Government with Mr. Fadden as
Treasurer would certainly shut down hard
on the 1.L.0. racket.
The Blackmarketeer's Mate.
“When an inquiry is held and documents
are produced the people will be shocked
at the vast extent of pillaging in Austra-
lian ports.” So said J. R. Orchard, vice-
chairman of the Launceston Fifty Thou-
sand League, commenting on a national
disgrace of which his own port has had
and is having painful experience.
But Mr. Orchard doesn’t really expect
the Federal “Labor” Government to order
such an inquiry, much less to act upon
the report and recommendations of any
body of investigators. He said indeed
that “all these robberies appear to be
passively and automatically accepted by
the ‘Government’ as inevitable, and the
claims are paid for out of taxpayers’
money.” A reference to Commonwealth
“control” of shipping, which will be in an
almighty mess when “control” ceases.
In June and July, Hobart “Mercury”
has recorded, the Holyman concern at
Launceston had to be the instrument of
“paying about £740 to consignees for
cargo pillaged at its wharves.” A list
of goods stolen from Holyman ships
during the two months was appended:
Groceries, £202; drapery, knitted and
millinery goods, £B4; chemists’ goods, £72;
nearly a complete shipment of razor blades
valued at £7O; hardware, £53 ; motor acces-
sories, £5l; wireless and electrical goods,
£4B ; bottled ale and spirits, £3O; fancy
goods, £29; footwear, £29 ; food, £22; con-
fectionery, £2l; tobacco, £l7; and build-
ing materials (including roofing iron), £lO.
Revealing as to the position at Laun-
ceston, but only a drop in the bucket
compared with what goes on at larger
ports. In Brisbane it is reckoned that
there is an average loss of £6OO on every
3000 tons of pillageable cargo. “Cargo-
picking” it is called in the worst circles.
At Brisbane a special anti-pillaging police
squad was formed in March, 1945, and
during the following six months more
than 300 wharflaborers, seamen, dockers
and other persons were convicted and
fined or sent to jail—though jail sentences
were rare. There were second or third
convictions in many cases.
Conviction is no bar to continued
membership of the Waterside Workers’
Federation. According to a Mr. Eng-
lart, branch secretary of the W.W.F.,
offenders purge their offence by being
fined or imprisoned and are not therefore
liable to expulsion from the union. This
is union policy at all ports. However
vile the crime, the criminal, per favor of
Communists, keeps his union ticket. And
this is not forbidden under National
Security (Cargo Protection) Regulations
issued in accordance with the “ ‘Labor’
principle” of solving problems by issuing
regulations which are never enforced.
In Sydney wharf robbers even when
caught redhanded —which seldom happens
—are usually treated as worthy fellows
who have yielded to a sudden temptation
and can be cured by kindness. An excep-
tion was made when a stipendiary magis-
trate handed out six-month sentences to
two ruffians convicted of having stolen
“16 brief cases and a radio set.” Saying
“they can’t do this to us,’' the ruffians
appealed to Quarter Sessions on the
ground that the punishment was excessive.
/
They and their backers were flabbergasted
when Judge Stacy, with appropriate re-
marks, increased the sentences to 12
months. For wharf robberies, as for
Communist larrikinism, law, sternly en-
forced, is the only remedy, but it is a
remedy which “Labor” never applies.
The wharf robber feeds the black-
market. With the supply of mugs dimin-
ishing, for reasons which are all too
obvious, and with competition increas-
ingly severe, blackmarketeers have taken
to bumping off one another. A most
desirable development; still it is no use
hoping that the infamous trade will dis-
appear in a frenzy of mutual slaughter,
Mr. Beasley member for a water-
front electorate. When he was No. 4in
the Ministry it was brought to his notice
that over 400 cases of beer consigned to
the troops at Lae had been broached at
Sydney and that the robbers had not spared
“Red Cross supplies of orange juice and
other goods for the troops in that area,”
nor even “Red Cross hygiene supplies for
nurses.” Mr. Beasley replied that he was
“disgusted” and that “no person could
stoop to a more despicable action than that
referred to ; but, unfortunately, pillaging
is rife.” He nevertheless expressed the
“hope” that “we shall soon be able to
root out those responsible for the evil
and expose them to the world at large.”
There has been no rooting out nor any
exposure ; and Mr. Beasley is now above
the battle, as it were.
Coal and Capricornla.
Up in North Queensland, which almost
surrounds the Federal principality of
Francis Michael Forde, they’re looking
forward to September 28 with relish.
North Queensland’s first reaction to
the recent meat strike was a stunned and
angry silence. It found its voice when it
discovered that the conspirators respon-
sible were to escape scot-free.
NSftrth Queensland people had taken
much from coal strikers in the
south and from Commo-led wharfies in
its own and other ports. They saw ships
tied up and wharves idle while material
for the south accumulated and material
for the north couldn’t be got. They knew
that the beef herds in the hinterland
would have to miss a killing season and
that their income from meat and hides and
tallow wouldn’t be along this year. They
learned that Mt. Isa was closing down for
lack of coal, and they found that, al-
though the Chifleys and Wards and
Fordes were willing to finance a gran-
diose unemployed-relief rail-standar-
disation scheme, they wouldn’t grant even
£lO,OOO for water-supply investigation in
N.Q.
As if this wasn’t enough, they were told
there would be no seaside or country ex-
cursion trains this year and that ships
would be conspicuous by their absence.
N.Q. was still chewing this over when
several things occurred at once.
There was a strike at the Rhonnda and
Noblevale collieries near Ipswich. State
Transport Minister Walsh had offered to
buy 50,000 tons of coal a year from the
Blair Athol open-cut mine, whereupon
union bosses howled to heaven about
“bolstering up private enterprise at Blair
Athol” and threatened to order Chifley
and Co. to “nationalise” the Queensland
collieries. Blair Athol is in Mr. Forde’s
electorate.
Then J. H. Julin, whose concern got a
640-acre coal lease in the Callide Valley
in 1945, arose full of wrath, stating that
his firm had a State order for 50,000
tons, had plenty ,of other orders, and
could fill them many times over were it
not for divided control:
To start mining in Queensland you have
to have two licences —one from the Coal
Commissioner, giving you authority to
mine, and another from the Central Coal
Board, giving you authority to sell. One
is useless without the other.
Whereupon the C.C.B. secretary an-,
nounced that Julin’s application for a
licence in September, 1945, had been re-
fused on the ground of “insufficient
trade.” A decision such as that, made at
a time when there would be a welcome
market for every ton of coal Julin or
anyone else could produce, whether it
had to go from Callide to Cooktown or
as far as Adelaide, would be incredible
in any other country. In this, of course,
Queensland is meeting the same Canberra
policy (really the Commo-led Miners’
Federation policy) which Premier Play-
ford, of S.A., had to fight and overcome
in order to get his State’s Leigh Creek
field working. The Commos of the
Miners’ Federation don’t want any more
coal seams opened up; so long as they
can keep Australian industry and trans-
port dependent upon the N.S.W. coal-
fields, over which they exercise a rule as
autocratic as that of a feudal baron, they
can keep cracking the whip.
There’s a lot more, of course, but this
is the main leaven of the ferment working
up north and reaching into the south.
And it cannot be allayed by the'Forde
cotton bounty, fourteen-seventeenths of
which will be paid to Capricornia electors.

CARRERAS LTD. - OVER 150 YEARS’ REPUTATION FOR QUALITY
POLITICAL POINTS
With only a pretence of discussion,
Ward’s Railway Standardisation Agree-
ment Bill was whirled through both
Chambers before the 17th Parliament
turned up its toes. Archie Cameron, one
of the few members who were not half-
dead for lack of sleep, noted that Queens-
land was not a party to the agreement
and wanted to know why Ward wasn’t
“unifying the gauge north of the Brisbane
Line.” Ignoring the question. Ward trotted
over the old stuff about the “project”
finding work for 34,000 Diggers. That
will enable Employment Service to add
three words to its current formula:
“Would you like to be a postman or a
railway navvy?” Ninety-nine per cent, of
servicemen don’t want to be either.
A news service to cost anything from
£200,000 p.a. upwards is to be inflicted
on a reluctant A.B.C. by the “Labor”
members of the Parliamentary Broad-
casting Committee, elections permitting.
What it will be like if “Labor”
gets back without Haylen, of Parkes
—which means that Haylen will be
available to direct it —was indicated
when Haylen applied the term “political
stooge” to the writer of an innocent
A.B.C. serial, “The Lawsons.” Married
lady, too; but then nobody expects
chivalry from “Labor” members like
Haylen and Mountjoy.
When the expiring House was giving
a rotten imitation of being a deliberative
assembly Lazzarini dashed in to report
that, on the word of a Mr. Conde,. there
was nothing in Harrison’s charges that
large quantities of salvage had been <p)ld
as “rag” to a Jewish concern, or in
Fadden’s charges that refrigerators
“worth £100” had been quitted at
£7 10s. and £9 10s. Harrison replied that
Mr. Conde hadn’t called for evidence,
verbal or documentary, though he could
have had “statutory declarations and
other documents” from Harrison. Fad-
den said he hadn’t been asked for his
testimony or for duplicate receipts of the
refrigerator sales. Lazzarini got off some-
thing about “stooges,” whicn he had to
withdraw ; and in his excitement he made
the significant admission that all salvage
is now sold by tender. Who Mr. Conde
is nobody but Lazzarini seems to know.
With a scorching drought in its back
Country and early August blazing like a
midsummer month, Sydney awoke on
Monday morning to find (1) a detective
had been shot through the heart and his
mate injured after they had placed two
men under arrest; (2) a big shipyard was
to close because the Labor Council had
declared it “black”; (3) Government
engine-drivers and firemen were threaten-
ing “drastic action” unless coal was
diverted from B.H.P. to the railways,
those dependent on B.H.P. steel and
other products being consigned to blazes,
and (4) the city’s bread, having been
baked last Friday and endured a week-
end of excessive heat, was as dry and
hard as bricks. Weighing % the loaves
thoughtfully in their hands, many house-
wives debated the wisdom of going
somewhere and throwing them at some-
body as a means of putting in their spare
time, Mr, Chifley was not available,
having gone electioneering in Westralia.
At the end of one of the numerous
“exchanges” at the “Peace” Conference,
during which Vishinsky got into verbal
holts with Bidault and Evatt was heard
to murmur “Well, spare me days,” the
Frenchman said: —■
I am very sorry for this interruption.
There is nothing for the interpreters to in-
terpret, because I consider that nothing
has been said.
A precise description of the entire 11
plenary sessions.
In a fireside chat a long way after
Roosevelt, Chifley quoted Scullin as say-
ing that “never in the history of the Labor
movement” had he “seen such a solid
body as in the Federal Parliament today.”
Had the former Prime Minister been
taking a sectional survey of his colleagues
from the neck up? His successor re-
marked “We have been in office five years,
and I think those years speak for them-
selves.” In pay envelopes particularly.
Despite Premier Cain’s assurance, a
liquor poll won’t be ’held in 1948 in con-
junction with the Victorian State elec-
tions. Section 295 of the Licensing Act
provides for a vote every eight years on
a day within three months before or
after the date of a general election. And
it may be that in 1948 Mr. Cain’s Gov-
ernment will be a dim recollection, along
with Nineveh and Tyre.
Brisbane “Courier-Mail” expects that
the current session of the Queensland
Parliament will bring forth an amended
Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration
Act to (a) make a secret ballot compul-
sory before a strike, (6) compel the lodg-
ment with the Industrial Court of private
addresses of union members and (c) pro-
vide penalties where strikes occur without
the holding of a secret ballot, the penalties
to be imposed on union officials held
responsible. The amendments look good
as far as they go, but union officials
could be held responsible without any
alteration of the law.
Mt. Isa, which employs 950 men, had
to stop work last week for lack of coal,
and State departmental chiefs were busy
with explanations. Manager of the Col-
linsville State coalmine:
Lack of railway trucks is the main factor.
This has disorganised our delivery to Mt.
Isa. We must have a guarantee of surplus
trucks each day.
Railways Commissioner Wills ;
The coal is not being turned out by the
Collinsville mine for Mt. Isa. We have
sent all that has been consigned.
Perhaps the 950 unemployed could be
issued with a wheelbarrow each to cart
the coal themselves; that is, if someone
will cut it
Watts, the Westralian Country-party
leader, to Wise, the “Labor” Premier:
How does the Premier explain that, for
1946, the areas licensed for wheat in N. S.
Wales and Victoria are respectively
1,800,000 acres and 947,000 acres more than
in 1938-39, and in Westralia 799,000 acres
less? Is the Federal “Labor” Government
or the State “Labor” Government respon-
sible?
Wise asked for notice of the question or
something. It is a dodge to which Mount-
joy and Lemmon will be unable to resort.
Westralia is thus far having another
good wheatgrowing season, whereas
great parts of Scully’s State are having
another bad one. Nature doesn’t seem
to approve of Scully’s policy.
Highlight of a speech from the House
at Canberra, as written down by a Tas-
manian :
The dust menace is causing men to hex-
pectorate their lungs away year by year,
and the ’ole thing ends in turmos.
To this and to other cauliflowers of de-
bate, the Tasmanian Women’s Non-Party
League objected in a message to Dame
Enid Lyons, stressing the “deplorable
crudity” of speakers and their “bad
grammar and bad manners.” Always
gracious, the lady replied that “lack of
aitches must not be allowed to influence
electors more than commonsense.” When
Archie Cameron’s opinion was asked for,
he said, “a member of Parliament is very
much like a member of a jury; he can’t
be very much better than the average of
the people who choose him.” Also:
“Parliament is produced by election, not
selection,” and it “brings two principal
things to the surface —the cream and the
scum.”
In Hong Kong for Melbourne “Argus,”
Peter Russo, the able Ballarat-born pro-
fessor who has turned newspaperman,
had a look at “285 Jewish refugees who
recently arrived from Shanghai, bound
for Australia,” and presumably consigned
to Caiwell, who was so indignant at the
arrival of a London family of four, “these
English people.” Russo found the
refugees “accommodated in the ballroom
of the Peninsula Hotel till travel arrange-
ments are made for them by the Austra-
lian and Hong Kong Governments,” The
children were improving the shin-
ing hour by “memorising in loud sing-
song voices booklets on Australia puo-
lished by the Australian Department of
Information,” their parents “quizzing one
another from other Information Depart-
ment booldets obtained in Shanghai.”
Arrived here the party will doubtless de-
mand to be housed in Calwell’s comfort-
able 225.-a-week cottages, which no Aus-
tralian serviceman has ever sighted.
Nobody knows what will happen to
wheatgrowers’ money which will be in
the “stabilisation fund” at the end of
five years, but woolgrowers can guess..
They have just seen a cool £7,000,000
made from war-time Government trading
in the sheep’s overcoat swiped into a so-
called “research and publicity fund.” In
Australia; and in Britain also, there is
talk of a farmers’ strike. In both
countries they have been subjected by
socialist Governments to what they
would never take from produce agents
or co-ops, and even land men can be
pressed too hard and far.
Chifley has entered upon his election
campaign, beginning in Westralia. He
would need the eloqaence of Cicero and
Burke to secure the return of the “Labor”
members for Perth, Forrest and Swan,
which went “Labor” in 1943 for the first
time for ages. And he will need to dodge
awkward questions about Mountjoy and
Mountjoy’s association with Communists,
especially Slav market-gardeners in the
.Mountjby electorate.
A flurry of kiteflying succeeded the
announcement that the Duke of
Gloucester will cease to be Governor-
General at the end of January. One flown
in Scullin’s direction brought a disclaimer
from that gentleman. The Evatt news-
paper claque was, of course, active, and
a young gentleman cabled from London
that “if some of those who have lately
been in close contact with Dr. Evatt have
the right impression, he has not dropped
his keenness to become Governor-
General ; possibly we should hear of it
after the general election,” It all depends
how the general election goes. In any
case the aspiring gentleman, at 52, would
think twice before he condemned himself
to genteel inactivity for five years, with
genteel obscurity to follow. Isaac Isaacs
was 77 when he became G.-G.
The Canadian Government’s five-year
guarantee to its wheatgrowers works out
at ABs. sd. a bushel. Publishing this, the
Adelaide “Advertiser” points out that the
best even Australian growers of 1945-46
wheat can hope for is 7s. lOd.
Asked to facilitate a joint overseas tour
by Australian farmers, Scully replied that
lack of travel facilities was an obstacle,
and that in any case the proposed trip
ought to be made by small groups. Lack
of travel facilities hasn’t affected the
trips of “Labor” Ministers and their wives
and minor “Labor” politicians and their
wives. Shipping shortage also did not
prevent British farmers sending a dele-
gation to Australia last year.
Discussing C.P. chances in N.S.W.
Sydney “Sun” commented “At the last
elections the party lost Calare, Hume
and Riverina to Labor, and then Gwydir
to Labor at a by-election.” The statement
is 25 per, cent, correct. Hume* was wrested
from thp Country party in the 1943 land-
slide ; Calare and Riverina had already
gone to Labor by small majorities in
1940. The by-election at which Wheat-
magician Scully won Gwydir took place
in 1937.
There is no escape from the bureau-
crat. In Queensland, where the Govern-
ment has found it necessary—lacking any
coal for its railway trains—to issue per-
mits to road carriers, the innocent car-
riers let out yelps of joy and rushed off
to the State Transport offices. Then they
found that (a) they must pay a fee of 3d.
a ton a mile and (6) the permit was
limited to the trip. One chap, running a
five-ton load of fruit twice a week from
Brisbane to border districts, found that it
would cost him £23 a week in permit fees
alone. He thought of petrol tax, income
tax, payroll tax, sales tax and a few other
things and was last seen weeping into a
case of over-ripe oranges.
“Norther” from an election meeting:
Childers is in Wide Bay (Q.), and it was
slightly stirred when it learned that Max
Julius, a Commo candidate, was to stage a
“street rally,” Commos being rather un-
popular in Queensland since the meat strike.
Maxie turned up and about 200 turned out,
and about the first thing that happened was
Maxie being invited to “come down and fight.”
Then they cut off his amplifier and made other
signs, and Maxie called upon “democratic
people” to “protect” him. Till then it was
all fun and games, but when the 1 Commo
dragged religion into it the police had to
stop the war, and Max withdrew, later to com-
plain that people were “prowling round my
hotel looking for my blood.” They were prob-
ably only looking for a drink, but Max couldn’t
know that, and presently Childers knew him no
more.
Chairman Bell of the Melbourne
Tramways received a pertinent chal-
lenge to his plan for scrapping buses and
reverting to tramcars. Councillor Eric
Hall, of Frankston, managing director of
Peninsular Bus Lines, ha’s offered to
demonstrate in the city streets the ability
of an Australian-made 60-passenger bus,
which can carry 90, to prove that really
modern buses can cope with the heaviest
city traffic more efficiently than fixed-
line transport. His buses have two wide
exits at the side, instead of the single one
at the tail which causes all the conges-
tion and bad language in Mr. Bell’s
caravans. One of these buses has travelled
4000 miles, part of which was a trip from
Melbourne to Toowoomba (Q.) with 60
passengers. Moreover, it has two engines,
synchronised but independent, so it
doesn’t break down as often as Mr. B.’s
do.
There is an optimist who buys a copy
of each edition of every Sydney daily.
He is a curio-collector, and he hopes,
before he dies, to add to his collection an
issue which has not had to report a
strike, an attack by thugs on some harm-
less citizen or the shooting of a policeman.
Such a prize he believes worth the ex-
pense.
C. Evatt, N.S.W. Minister for No
Tourists and No Immigration, gave the
Australian-Russian Society “a solemn
warning” that “Fascism is not dead in
the world or in Australia.” Red Fascism
is very much alive in Australia and it is
nurtured by dupes and muddle-headed en-
thusiasts of the Aust.-Russ. brand every
bit as much as by the acknowledged
Commo.
The Chifley crowd have adopted the
false and paltry excuse that, even if the
miners worked a fair time, the country
wouldn’t have enough coal because of its
expanding industries and population. It
won’t comfort men out of work because
coal strikes have held up production of
raw materials and denied their companies
the power to drive the machines.
At the second post-war French election.
Daladier and Reynaud succeeded against
all-comers, and the Communists vainly
tried to prevent their taking their seats.
Turning on them spiritedly, Daladier said
that Britain and the United States “bore
the weight of the war ‘and saved the
liberty of the world.” As for the Corns’
Moscow masters, he revealed that they
were already intriguing with Hitler when
they invited Britain and France to send
a military mission to the Kremlin, and
that he and Chamberlain had induced the
Polish Government to let Russian troops
cross this country when the Great Doucic-
Cross was sprung on them, a month after
they had placed in Molotov’s hands a
pact which would have prevented the
war.

fox furs complaining to the salesman that
the dearest tie he had to offer was only
twelve and six. Still, she was sick of
traipsing about and she liked the color, so
she supposed she’d have to take it.
When the salesman had wrapped the tie
up and handed her the bill and the
change the befurred one asked him to
lend her his pencil. When he handed it
over she took the bill and altered the
figure one of the amount to a two, turned
to the friend with her and said, “You
know, Gert, Harry would be positively
furious if he knew I’d only paid that for
his tie —this’ll make him happy.” And,
calmly handing his pencil back to the
dumbfounded salesman, she strolled off.
Wonder what racket Harry’s in?

“Meekatharra”: This is not intended as
an insult to any Tasmanians in the audi-
ence, In the local filmhouse a T.V.A.
film showing tremendous dams, hydro-
electric schemes and gigantic earth-
moving equipment was followed by a
newsreel which included a few shots of
the Speck’s Clark Dam and hydro-electric
scheme. The announcer waxed eloquent
on the prospects and on the work —“the
most modern equipment is being used
to build the dam,” he said. Unfortu-
nately at that moment the camera shifted
to show a powerful Aussie laboriously
cracking stones with a 16-pound hammer.
From the gust of laughter which swept
the place a lot of chaps in the audience
must have swung banjos or madmicks in
their time.

“Oliver Filter”: Drink may be the
cause of the hitting in hit-and-run acci-
dents (B. 7/8/’46), but confirmed reckless
drivers don’t need alcohol to sool ’em on.
Drinking and wild driving are separate
vices, and I’d sooner drive with some
chaps slightly sozzled than I would with
others stone sober. The two combined
may constitute a double menace, but
many motorists I’ve known drive with
more caution after they’ve had a few
beers. The running sequel in hit-and-run
tragedies is caused by an immediate, un-
reasoning fear at the time of the acci-
dent, and later, when saner judgment
prevails, fear of returning after running
away. A friend of mine who went up
on a hit-and-run charge a few years ago
was a sober, careful driver and the acci-
dent was not his fault. But the moment
he saw the pedestrian loom out of the
darkness and felt the soft thud and bump
panic turned him into a madman. And
he wasn’t callous —a year or two before
a little ginger mongrel ran under his
wheels and he nearly turned the car
. over trying to avoid it. He pulled up,
took the dog to the side of the road,
spent half an hour in an unsuccessful
search for the owner, and then buried the
dog in a vacant paddock. He was upset
about it for a couple of days. Yet when
he skittled a pedestrian he went as though
all the hammers of hell were on his wheel.

“Curate’s Egg”: It seems that human
bodily changes, at least those determining
facial contour, develop along consistently
“pattern” lines. When a friend directed
my attention to a bar patron with the
remark “Isn’t that chap like the Duke of
Windsor?” the object of our attention,
who certainly did reproduce Windsor’s
now ageing features, caught me in the act
of scrutinising him. To my surprise he
joined us, claiming an acquaintance which
I could not recollect till he introduced
himself. Immediately I remembered him
as a form mate of mine, at 13 known as
“Prince Teddy” to the whole school.

“Eureka”: .Until the recent blizzards
few people had heard of Nimmitabel,
one of the coldest little towns in Aus-
tralia. Almost within the shadow of Mt.
Kosciusko, it gets the full blast of the
westerlies across the snowfields. The R.C.
church is built on higher ground than
any other church in Australia, while the
round tower of the old mill is one of
the two oldest still standing in N.S.W.
(the other is at Mt. Gilead, near Camp-
belltown). It started out as a wind-
“These Canberra broadcasts are a great saving on the gas. Dad!”
driven mill, with large wooden arms, but
these revolving arms cast moving shadows
on the town’s business street, and
frightened the horses to such an extent
that the owner was forced to remove the
sails and use machinery. Of the only
hotel in the town it is claimed that the
water from one pitch of the roof runs
west to find its way into the Murrum-
bidgee, from the other east to find its
way into the Bega River. Before the
railway came to Nimmitabel local people
spelt it Nimmitybelle, and they are still
arguing about the origin of the name.

“Fancar”; Re malnutrition and the
well-to-do (B. 24/7/’46). An ex-p.-0.-w.
nurse who starved in Korea compared
notes with a man who has all his life
enjoyed farm fare cooked by one of the
finest cooks. Both were on a special
course of vitamiri B tablets. The man
was suffering a peculiar gland trouble
which may be more prevalent than one
would suppose, and would account for
malnutrition among the well-to-do.

“Zake”: It is no uncommon thing in
northern N.S.W. coalfields towns to pay
10s. on race days for a place at the bar
counter. A Wynyard (Sydney) bus
queuer found a cheaper though riskier
way of having a “possie” kept for her.
She—it could only be a woman—had
parked on the footpath inside the yellow-
lined lanes, and right by the post where
the bus came in, a bunch of tissue paper-
wrapped flowers and two brown-paper
parcels. The lady herself, I suspect, was
sitting in the waiting-room, but with
an eye skinned ready to pounce when the
incoming bus hove in sight.

“Jasby”; A Sydney radio man inter-
viewed half a dozen groan-music addicts
on their reaction to the news that Frankie
Sinatra was planning to build a boxing
stadium in Hollywood. The first girl, who
said that deffunately Frankie was the best
singer in the world, because he was lovely
and deffunately did things to her, rather
astounded the announcer by referring to
Sinatra as an Australian. She seemed
quite surprised to learn that The Groan
was a Yank, but generously added that
that would make no difference to her
regard for him, “Would Sinatra’s new
role of boxing promoter shake her at
all?” “Deffunately not.” The other five
fans varied in the degree of their allegi-
ance to Frankie —one placed him second
to Bing and another rated Dick Haynes
above him —but without exception they
managed to bring the word “deffunately”
into their piece. The Sinatra stadium
story was news to all of them and they
had no views at all about it, except one
girl, the Bing-er, who suggested that it
was just a publicity stunt. Do I agree?
But deffunately.

“Passun”: A few days after we were
taken prisoner a young Jap lieutenant
came to inspect our grenade-dump. We
wondered what he was up to when he
grabbed a “pine-cone” and began muck-
ing it about. The Jap grenade is made
of cardboard and once primed needs the
draught of a stout pair of lungs to fan
the fuse before it is ready for throwing.
The enemy “loot” was entirely ignorant
of our weapon, but being too proud to
make inquiries was determined to satisfy
his curiosity. We saw the pin come out
and the poor mug blowing like a bellows
just as we hit the ground. None of us
was hurt, but the inquisitive one took
three of his mates with him.
“Ramac”: It’s always been an interest-
ing speculation about the amount ofl
knowledge the Japs had on Australia.
One day I discovered a new angle to
gladden the heart of any Federal poli-
tician. Lugging theodolite and dumpy-
level for a Jap surveyor at Haisho
(Hainan Island), an arid, stinking hole.
without a settled population and worse
than any other place on earth, I was
impressed by a town-plan, six feet square,
that was spread out on the sand. Close
examination revealed an impressive lay-
out that looked vaguely familiar. The
surveyor, noting my interest, told me it
was the future Haisho. To hide my un-
controllable laughter I knelt down and
peered closely at the plan. Beneath it
was clearly seen, in English, “Canberra,
Australian Capital Territory.”
“McGlum”: It was surprising to read
in a daily that low-ranking Jap war
criminals recently arriving in Sydney spent
a good deal of time abusing and swear-
ing at a Jap lieut.-col. who accompanied
them. They may have abused him, al-
though as an ex-p.-0.-w. who knows that
officers received blind respect and devo-
tion from o.rs., I can’t quite believe it.
As for swearing, that is impossible, unless
they had acquired an English vocabulary.
The most abusive word the Japs have
is “dog.” We were called that repeatedly
until our masters learned our own effec-
tive “language.” After that it was
dangerous to answer back, A slip of the
tongue and the slant-eye knew his an-
cestry was being questioned. But they
took evil delight in throwing our own
famous expletives at us, mixed with face-
slaps, kicks and beatings.

“Canon Law”: Echoes of the contro-
versies that used to rage over marriage
with a deceased wife’s sister, sternly for-
bidden by Church of England law as set
out in the prayer book, were revived by
action taken a few weeks ago when the
Convocation of Canterbury promulgated
and enacted a new “Table of Kindred and
Affinity.” The old table gave 62 pro-
hibited degrees of relationship; the new
list has only 50. As one consequence,
marriage with a deceased wife’s sister
will no longer be frowned upon.
But a man is still debarred from alliance
with his niece, and a woman can’t take
her nephew to the altar. In some Aus-
tralian States the law allows marriage
between uncle and niece; and marriage
has also been celebrated between aunt
and nephew. And I know at least one
case in which the bride was the widow of
the bridegroom’s son, which meant the
unravelling of a skein so far as the
childien s relationship was concerned

“Apthoro”: It’s easy enough to make
a clinical thermometer give a high read-
ing, but they just can t be coaxed down-
wards by dipping them in cold water
(B. 24/7/’46). Our doctor had a neat
method of catching a malingerer who had
found out how to make a thermometer
register a high temp. When the patient
was given the thermo, it registered 104
deg. When the doctor turned his back
the bluffer took it out to see how it was
cooking. Imagining he’d gone a bit too
far, he shook it back to 101. As a clini-
cal thermometer will only go down if
shaken down, the bloke lost his bed to a
more deserving case. I’ve been sucking
thermometers and wearing ’em under my
armpit for four years, so 1 won’t fall for
that one.

“Giddup”: With most of my acquaint-
ance, it seems to be a habit to welcome
the unexpected as it comes along, and
even enlarge upon it if possible—maybe
by way of injecting a few ups and downs
into the sameness of everyday life. I
found my friend Brown contemplating
his income-tax assessment. “Twenty quid
more than I expected,” he snarled—“just
as I expected! ”

“Trim”; A visit to the municipal
a b a tt°irs at Jaffa in 1942 first put me
wise that you can eat horseflesh without
knowing it, “Lord Luvus” (B. 24/7/’46).
And enjoy it too. A popular Tel Aviv
dish was “schnitzel,” believed to be pre-
pared from veal. After long spells on
Spinney’s Specials this “schnitzel” dish
was one to back up on. The Wogs at
the abattoirs were killing camels when
I was there and the w.o. of the British
butchering unit was looking on. “Who
eats that stuff?” I asked. “Jaffa and Tel
Aviv, mostly Jaffa,” he replied. I said
“I suppose Tel Aviv goes in more for
beef.” He smiled. “Tel Aviv hasn’t gone
for beef for years,” he remarked.
“I’ve been here three years and they’ve
killed half a dozen cows in that
time. It’s nearly all horse goes to Tel
Aviv with a bit of dog thrown in. I
wouldn’t eat meat ip Tel Aviv for quids.”
I didn’t, either, after that.
* * * *
“Gravelsnatcher”: Can’t say I blame
those Wogs for cliftying “Philm’s” sand-
bags from the earthworks he was con-
structing in Syria (B. 3/7/’46). With a
couple of feet of snow on the ground and
food and apparel scarce, it must have
irked those thrifty peasants to see good
clothing material wasted on a tank
obstacle which, thrown across the Bekaa
Plain, wouldn’t have survived five
minutes’ attention from any tank crew
who noticed it. When the Tommies came
over from Persia to relieve the Sixth
and Seventh Divvies a Tommy officer
discussed the possibility of a German
drive through Turkey. “If they do
come,” he said, “I’d like you blokes to
be here. You might stop them.” I
think he’d seen our tank trap.

“K.G.”: All honor to Thomas Mow-
bray (B. 31/7/’46), but my Presbyterian
conscience will not allow him to be named
as the first Presbyterian minister in Vic-
toria—Port Phillip in his day. This honor
really belongs to James Clow, who held
the first service on the last Sunday in
1837. He had no official status from
headquarters in Sydney; the first regular
minister was James Forbes, M.A.,
brought to Australia by John Dunmore
Lang. Forbes built Scots Church, then
seceded and founded the Free Church
and built its first church. He pub-
lished the first religious periodical in Mel-
bourne, gave the first temperance lecture,
helped to organise what is now the
Athenaeum and established a Scottish
school. Mowbray did not arrive until
1842.

“Cauboy”: Musical judgments, is it
(B. 31/7/’46)? The Australian wife of a
world-famous violinist was going to have
a baby and had to go to a hospital in
Melbourne. Her husband came along
every day and played his fiddle —a Strad.
—at her bedside. Occupants of rooms
on the same floor who knew who their
distinguished entertainer was were de-
lighted with this opportunity' of hearing
the virtuoso and looked forward every
day to a free'concert. A patient on the
floor above, howeyer, felt differently
about it. He sent for the matron and
complained that a hospital was not a fit
and proper place for an inmate to practise
the fiddle. “I wouldn’t mind so much,
he added, “if the fellow knew how to
play it.”
THE BORDERLINER.
The coming elections, it’s true, may provide
To the popular will a reliable guide
And some pleasant excitement - for legions and
clans
Of noisily loyal and robust partisans;
While, for those who are not, they’re a break
of a kind
In existence’s dull and monotonous grind
When such a diverse aggregation of souls
Hold the fate of so few in their hands at the
polls.
But few of these few, it’s quite well understood',
Wouldn’t cheerfully dodge the ordeal if they
could,
And the glummest of all in these days you can
meet
Is the bloke with his stern on a borderline seat.
Let the chaps who could thumping majorities
show
Over all opposition three winters ago
Pretentiously puli' out their chests as they fling
Their cadies exultantly into the ring
And announce, as all creeds but their own they
condemn,
It’s all over bar shouting. It may be for them,
Who’ve no apprehension of missing the ’bus,
But what’s ryebuck for them may be ruin for
us;
And the loss of a thousand per annum and
perks
Is, past all gainsaying, a prospect that irks.
Black care ever rides in the guise of defeat
At the back of the cove in a borderline seat.
To dress up his windows of course he’s allowed
With the showiest goods he can claim for his
crowd,
Or make up, if he must, for the scantness of
those
By the stacks of hard words he can pelt at his
foes.
But, admit it or not, he’s profoundly aware
Keeping sweet with the mob is a ticklish affair,
And holding one’s own is a difficult' biz
With a grip so extremely precarious as his.
For thousands of voters may alter their view
As swiftly and surely as weathercocks do,
A dismal reflection that often must greet
The bird who is perched on a borderline seat.
Of all of the shocks that a pendulum brings
When, sooner or later but ever, it swings,
The direst and worst, there’s no need to repeat,
Endanger the bloke on the borderline seat.

“Pitt St.”: Passing through an inner
Sydney suburb on business the other day
I sighted a cigarette queue, dropped off
the tram and got in line, about 40th from
the tobacconist’s door. At once 1 became
aware of looks both curious and dour, but
held my place and shuffled forward as
the selling began. About 10 minutes later
I reached the counter. The tobacconist
looked at me coldly. “Ain’t servin’
foreigners,” he said, and turned to the
next. “Here,” I bawled, “I’m as much an
Australian as you are! What d’ you
mean —foreigner?” The tobacconist
looked at me briefly. “Never said you
wasn’t an Australian,” he said, wearily.
“You don’t live round here, that’s all.”
And, under the cold, grim eyes of his
customers I sneaked out.

“Blank File”: During six years in the
army I was never to discover just what
was meant when the higher-ups spoke of
someone as being “officer type.” At
first I had a dim notion that it described
a cove who could be trusted to do his job
efficiently and handle the men under him.
Later 1 shared the prevalent view that the
shape of a moustache and a refined accent
were qualifications. For a period I was
with a small specialist detachment under
the command of a senior n.c.o. A capable
chap with years of business experience, a
fund of technical knowledge, presentable
and immensely popular with the lads, he
did a great job in organising and running
the outfit. When it was decided to make
the detachment a self-contained unit
under a commissioned officer it was natur-
ally thought that he would be given the
command. He was rejected as not be-
ing “officer type.” The post was given to
a “loot” who could have passed as a
model for a firm of military tailors and
who spoke with a plum in his mouth. He
had had no experience of the work of
the unit and took little trouble to learn
after his appointment. The n.c.o. con-
tinued to carry the show on his back and
ended his army career without a com-
mission. What it was he lacked has still
got me beaten.

“Clooter”: In a depressed moment
somebody or other once remarked that
“life is just one damned thing after an-
other” and the statement has been fairly
frequently quoted ever since. Nobody
finds it more apt just now than the
Sydney housewife, who no sooner over-
comes one difficulty than she runs slap
into another. Her battle to obtain food-
stuffs, clothing, fuel and light for her
family—even if she has a home to keep
them in—is with her all the time, and
every now and then something comes
along to make things tougher. In Sydney
recently it was day-baking, introduced by
a “Labor” Government, which gives her
bread four days old on Monday, so that
her workers can’t have sandwiches for
that day’s lunch and she must either
bake something or issue them with at least
Is. 6d. with which to buy a lunch, thus
adding to the h.c.l. Lately, too, it’s been
clothing—shirts, socks and similar things
being almost unobtainable. Now, a blow
which might well be the final one has
fallen, she can’t buy washing soap for
the laundry—meat strikes having cut
down tallow supplies. She’s doing what
she can with toilet soaps and bits bor-
rowed here and there, but since most of
her menfolk have but two or three shirts
and fewer socks she’s up against it. How-
ever, between now and September 28
she’ll be literally showered with soft soap.

“K.G.C.”: Apart from his “Plevna”

of Glenrowan. Ryan journeyed to

“K.R.”:' Can’t agree that we must
always be technically correct in our use
of “only” (B. 7/ 8 / ’46). Its popular usage
rarely confuses the meaning of a sen-
tence ; and when used in speech there is
no possible misunderstanding, accent and
intonation making the meaning clear.
Fowler favors the popular placing; and
urges that it is “justified by historical and
colloquial usage and often demanded by
rhetorical needs.” I only add this last
sentence as a sample of its general appli-
cation, not of its misuse.

“Pab D?’: Our office boy, not given
to pranks, confided to me that a small

Since I’d just paid 30 bob for a dicky-
dirt you could shoot peas through, I
grabbed my hat and bolted up town. My
suspicions were aroused when I reached
the shop a short head in front of the rest
of the staff, but he hadn’t lied—in the
window were half a dozen stiff-fronted
dress shirts at half a guinea each.

“V. Cluse”: Jephson has discovered
a new menace. He was travelling per
tram to work the other morning, having
for once secured a window seat, when
he noticed a small red car sidle up beside
the tram. He looked at the driver and a
pleasant shock ran down to his toes. She
was young, pretty and smartly turned
out and she was definitely smiling at
Jephson. He raised his hat and smiled
back. The car drew ahead. Wondering
for whom she had mistaken him, Jephson
sat a little straighter and inwardly glowed
at the obvious interest of acquaintances
aboard the tram. Then the red car
dropped back to run beside the tram again
and Jephson’s heart turned over as the
young woman, coyly smiling, signalled
him to leave the tram and join her. Puzzled,
flattered, half-scared, Jephson got off a,t
the next stop, the target of 50 eyes. The
red car awaited him with opened door.
Now almost in a daze Jephson got in.
“Surprised?” the girl asked. Jephson
gulped something. “It’s a new idea,”
she went on. “You see, I represent the
Supertonic Photograph Company. Our
charges are right and our work is beyond
criticism. We make studies of your
family in the home or in our” But
the profanity that burst from Jephson
overcame her and coldly she ejected him
upon the kerb. All he hopes is that his
missus will accept his explanation when
the inevitable question arises.

“Derwent”: Strange how the word
“squatter,” which originated in the odor
of non-respectability and then became the
tag worn by the best people, has now
slipped down the scale again. News-
papers of late have designated the
“squatter” as a person who jumps un-
occupied premises and refuses to shift,
“It's that bicuspid that's been causing the trouble
In one case, the term was fastened to a
motor-car purchaser who, having offered
the pegged price to the advertiser, struck
some opposition, flourished the fixed-
price ticket and the cash, and squatted in
the car. With all the publicity now be-
ing given to squatters Australians visit-
ing the homeland will have to be careful.'
And that old Australian novel The
Squatter’s Dream will find itself pushed
off library shelves if some vigilant censor,
drops across it.

“Findy” on salvage at sea:
There was a Cappy Ricks and Captain Kettle
flavor about the story of the seizure of the
salvaged derelict, American Farmer, by the crew
of another American vessel after a British ship
had put a prize crew on board. If the details
so far cabled are correct there seems to be
a strong case for the Elizabete’s owners and
crew, whether the matter is decided under
British or American salvage rules. The Ameri-
can Farmer, after a collision, had called
for help and had subsequently been abandoned.
She was thus fair game for any would-be
salvager. Elizabete got there first, put a prize
crew on board and managed to take the Farmer
in tow. Apparently when American Ranger
arrived and took possession by weight of num-
bers, the situation was well in hand. All the
essentials for a long-drawn-out case are present,
as the Ranger’s prize crew certainly got the
prize to port, but the Elizabete’s skipper can
claim that his own success was assured before
the other bloke butted in. British law concedes
that service which has contributed to an ulti-
mate rescue must be rewarded even though the
actual rescue has been effected by others. Ameri-
can law takes a similar view and lays down
that where a salvor has begun a salvage job
and is ready and able to carry it to com-
pletion, he cannot be summarily dismissed on
the arrival of other assistance. There have
been cases before where the original salvor has
been relieved by other vessels of the same line
as the distressed ship and it has usually been
held that the first man in still has his right to at
least a share of the salvage money. The novel
point about the present case is the forceful
seizure of the prize—Elizabete’s owners will
doubtless make this their strong point: the
opposition will probably urge that the Elizabete
was not capable of completing the job and
that Ranger’s skipper acted to protect the in-
terests of his line, which also owned the Ameri-
can Farmer.

“D.M.E.”: There are casual blokes in

disproof of age on enlistment in 1940

ance shown must have been paid with his

money to Egypt!” Six months later a

“Youanmi”: In an excellent short
documentary film of the Work of the
Tennessee Valley Authority the commen-
tator identifies the electric power and
the cables and steel towers that carry it
with “Paul Bunyan, the legendary giant
who strode across the country with a
bolt of lightning on each shoulder.” The
conception is a good one —although most
people in the audience had probably
never heard of Paul —and the power from
the scheme does seem to “stride across
the hills, softly humming, stopping here
to put his shoulder to an atom-bomb
project, and pausing there to help a
farmer’s wife churn her butter.” Cer-
tainly it seems that only a giant hand
could have harnessed the uncontrollable
floods and transformed the flood-eroded
valley and stricken towns of a few years
ago to the present thriving agricultural
and manufacturing district, with good
homes, ample power and wide lakes of
dammed-up water for swimming, fishing
and boating. Anyway, I checked up on
Paul in Britannica and found him all
he was cracked up to be. He was of
Canadian origin—“the legend is said to
have begun in the Papineau Rebellion in
Canada in 1837, when a ‘mighty-muscled,
bellicose, bearded giant named Paul Bun-
yan raged among the Queen’s troops
like Samson among the Philistines.’ ”
But it was the American loggers below
the border who made of Paul Bunyan a
true hero of camp nights’ entertainment.
They gave him Babe, the blue ox, who
measured forty-two axe handles and a plug
of chewing tobacco between the horns.
They created the mythical logging camp
with cookhouse of mountainous size and
peopled it with outstanding minor heroes.
They made their Paul Bunyan an inventor
and an orator and an industrialist whose
labors surpassed those of Hercules. He
ruled America in the period between the
Winter of the Blue Snow and the Spring
that the Rain Came up from China.
Truly a remarkable fellow.

“P. McM.”: Sighting an old friend in
a crowded Sydney store the other day, I
playfully jabbed him in the ribs three or
four times and, seeing that he still didn’t
turn around, gave him a modest push.
It’s a commentary on the manners of
Sydney crowds that he still wasn’t aware
of anything unusual until I sidled through
and grabbed him in a Rugby tackle.

“Philp”: For the benefit of “Clooter”
(B. 7/8/’46) and others who burble about
the beauties of golf, I record the follow-
ing thumbnail biography: At the age of
eight I was ambling happily along a
suburban road when a white missile with
a buzz like an angry hornet came from
nowhere and laid me flat for half an
hour; at eleven I received the toe of a
number nine brogue in the right place for
trying to get off with a golf ball which
could be sold elsewhere for a couple of
bob; at 14 an irate and vigorous uncle
gave me the father of a belting for bor-
rowing one of his clubs to retrieve a
cricket ball from a rather foul drain; at
20 a popsy I liked took up the game and
dumped me for some club swinger; at
24 I proposed to another biddy on a golf
course. Now, 20 years later, her acid
comments about my obesity, laziness and
general uselessness as a husband will soon
drive me to find refuge on week-ends by
taking up the wretched game myself.
RELAXATIONS OF THE GREAT.
“Mr. Attlee sat doodling thoughtfully with his
pen or doing crossword puzzles.”
—ltem from Paris conference.
There are, you may have realised, no end
Of ways in which the great of earth unbend,
Snatching a few short hours from world affairs
And statesmanship’s inevitable cares
For some less onerous pursuit of theirs,
Whence they return to see great issues threshed
Out, re-invigorated and refreshed.
Some turn to out-of-door amenities,
If one may term, them so. Tall forest trees
Came crashing down beneath the sturdy whacks
Of William Ewart Gladstone’s practised axe.
But Dizzy found it easier to relax
By writing novels. And our Parkes penned verse
Sometimes as good as “Bellerive’s” —seldom
worse.
Winston, when freed from Parliament’s re-
straints,
Sits at an easel in a glade and paints,
Or else recuperates by laying bricks;
While in defective yarns and Deadwood Dicks
Ben Chifley finds surcease from politics,
And Billy Hughes his self-esteem consoles-
By belting golf-balls towards distant holes.
Each to his taste. Myself, I must avow,
Would choose a book of verse beneath the
bough,
A jug of wine wherein to dip my muzzle,
Before the most intriguing crossword puzzle.

THE SERVICE MAN
When Canberra Got It.
Macnell : Four years ago on August
9 the waters of the Coral Sea closed over
my old ship Canberra.
At 2 a.m. the cruiser, in company with
Australia, Hobart and several U.S.
cruisers, was steaming off Guadalcanal
through a black, drizzling night. Hori-
zon-wards to starb’d waxing fingers of
flame edged the beach where U.S. troops
had landed the previous day. It was this
backdrop which silhouetted the cruiser
m «ru or * >edo S^ts of her attacker/
Without warning from the sea to port
there sprang suddenly the white wake of
a loosened torpedo. It sped straight for
Canberra’s boiler-room, its wake a tell-
tale ribbon stretched across the sea.
From her side spewed a sheet of flame;
a vast rampart of water towered above
her. She shook with the sudden upthrust
of T.N.T. and, her boiler-room blown
open to the sea, listed to port.
After the torpedoes came a rain of
shells that crashed on and through her
until her upper deck and innards were a
shambles. The ’plane burned fiercely on
its catapult. Ammunition in the pom-
pom ready-use lockers exploded like red-
hot meteors streaking out. The pitch of
the corticene covering her ’tween-decks
bubbled like a football bladder, then
“Found her hiding in the Food-for-Britain store , sir."
erupted into flame. Books, pictures, mess
stools, hammocks flamed instantly under
the terrific heat generated in each shell-
burst. Aluminium kit lockers melted and
spilled their contents to feed the fires.
In this inferno below decks the ship’s
surgeons sweated in their wardroom-sick-
bay. The wardroom was a scene straight
from Hell, wounded lying everywhere.
Yet the training and discipline of the
service ensured organisation even in this
chaos. Fire and repair parties were on
the job, doing what they could without
pressure on the mains. First-aid units
tended wounded from the smashed bridge
to the engine-rooms. Magazine crews
were ordered out and the compartments
flooded. Men dived into the exploding
pom-pom magazine and hurled boxes of
H.E. over the side. A torpedo instructor
fought his way through flames to fire the
loaded tubes before heat detonated the
warheads.
Although the U.S. destroyer Patterson
had her nose alongside to take off
wounded, not one able man abandoned
ship. It was almost dawn before they
finally gave her up. Canberra was then
aflame from end to end, her innards glow-
ing dully through the steel of her sides.
Men in boats and rafts and lifebelts
were picked up and transhipped to the
trooper Barnett. From there they
watched her go—transformed in two
hours from a proud fighting ship to a
twisted tangle of iron falling through the
dawnlit upper waters of the Pacific down
to the unfathomed bottom.
That sinking taught the Navy many
things concerning fire-control, damage-
control, armor-plate. It revealed to Aus-
tralians the courage, the endurance, the
unexpressed faith, the unspoken loyalty
that knit together a ship’s company.
The Oldest Digger.
With the death at Randwick (Sydney)
of Colonel Alfred Joshua Bennett, Aus-
tralia lost her oldest Digger. He was 81,
and was one of the best—a fine, modest,
manly and courteous Australian.
At 20 Bennett joined the Sudan
Contingent, and when that force returned
to Australia he was commissioned in the
First N.S.W. Regiment. In 1899 he again
volunteered for active service, this time
in South Africa, and, rising to major in
the N.S.W. Mounted Rifles, he was
severely wounded at Driefontein. He re-
turned to Sydney with a D.S.O. and two
mentions in dispatches.
With two wars behind him and his
fiftieth year in sight, he had fully earned
a base job when the big flare-up came in
1914, but base jobs weren’t Bennett’s idea
of soldiering, and he was very much pre-
sent at the Landing on Gallipoli as C.O.
of the First A.I.F. Battalion ; later of the
Fourth. Wounded at Lone Pine, he was
placed on transport duty for a couple of
years, but 1917 found him in an active
command again with the 20th Battalion
in France. Wounded a third time he
became C.O. of Australian Reinforce-
ment Camps in France.
That war over. Colonel Bennett, a
schoolteacher by profession, was for some
time Supervisor of Evening Continuation
Schools. From 1929 to 1932—those being
the days when honorable service as a
soldier was not a disqualification for the
post—he was Administrator of Norfolk
Island. A foundation member of'the
first Diggers’ organisation, the Sudan
Contingent Survivors’ Association, the
old soldier was always able to raise a
chuckle at Hop’s cartoon “The Roll Cali,”
published in The Bulletin when the
contingent returned to Sydney in 1885.
Experiment in Radar.
With 14 merchant captains and repre-
sentatives of shipping cos. aboard, the
frigate Condamine steamed out beyond
Sydney Heads and coursed southward. On
the bridge the party saw radar pick up
a Douglas 15 miles away heading
for Brisbane; saw the guns laid
accurately by a radar target indicating unit
on a merchantman barely visible to sea-
ward, and had a picture of Sydney and
environs painted by a revolving radar
aerial on a fluorescent screen.
The skipper then took them below to
the operations-room. He shut all doors
and portholes, and, surrounded by a
formidable array of radar sets and plot-
ting tables, intimated his intention of per-
sonally conning his ship into and’ up
Sydney Harbor. Navigating solely from
radar information, the captain brought
Condamine through the Heads. Noting a
spot of light on a fluorescent tube, he
asked one of the watchers to poke his
head out and verify that a Manly ferry
was crossing 800 yards ahead (it was),
altered course up harbor at exactly the
right moment to clear an unseen buoy,
reported a big ship coming out (an air-
craft-carrier), and rounded Bradley’s
Head with the same order of navigational
accuracy expected of a navigator taking
bearings on his bridge.
The observers left the ship more than
impressed by the uncanny ability of what,
for navigational purposes, most of them
had regarded as an interesting toy.

BACK TO QUEENSLAND.
By “Ek Dum.”
At piccaninny daylight there was a
knock at the door and the steward stood
there smiling with a tray. Yes, in Brisbane
stewards still smile, even in the dark of
345 a.m. The tram-conductors address
you gaily; the necfti lights, on a pre-war
scale, laugh their way down Queen-
street ; shops are a blaze of light and
color. Everywhere, despite the drought
and memories of the strike and the black-
out, there seem to be a vigor and hopeful-
ness about life, Brisbane, of all cities,
should have suffered a sea-change during
the war, but it has not. It is hard to be-
lieve that in less than three years
2,000,000 American troops—reckoning in
those who came again and again—
were filtered through it and that for
months on end nearly half its current
population was American. So far as
Brisbane is concerned Uncle Sam might
never have existed there.
It is not easy in the half-dawn to be-
lieve even that Brisbane itself exists as
we speed along the Ipswich-road to
Archerfield. The mists rise in the cold
dawn and hide the streets, but Archer-
field itself glows in ruby stars, and there
is comfort in the warm buffet where
Qantas, in the person of Mr. Allright,
serves us with coffee. Mr. Allright is the
steward of the DC3 which is to carry us
nearly to the Northern Territory border
before three o’clock today. I am not sure
that he spells his name as I spell it, but
I like it that way. The call for “Mr. All-
right” is the warcry of the Qantas traveller
throughout the day.
Qantas is the oldest passenger airline
in Australia—it beats Norman Brearley’s
Westralian enterprise by a matter of
months —and, as befits an entity old and
experienced, it has manifestations which
distinguish it from the other airlines.
One of them is Mr. Allright, with his two
rows of war ribbons. He it is who turns
what otherwise would be just a journey
for the average tourist into an adventure.
Other airlines serve their passengers
through a hostess with marcelled hair and
real nylons. No hostesses for Qantas!
Mr. Allright loses none of his dignity
as he watches tenderly over the heat-
smitten little family which boards the
aeroplane somewhere in the dusty west.
He seems to preside over everything with
the easy air of one who knows his world
from end to end and who feels himself
fit to cope with any emergency. He pro-
duces barley-sugar and beer; at will. He
is there at the right moment with a cup
of tea or a %iscreet snatch of conversa-
tion with a paling passenger. He wins
the friendship of a bride as he admires
her orchid and tells her “That’s a
Cattleya. My father grows them in his
glasshouse at Ealing.” He feeds a variety
of changing faces for 1200 miles. One
feels that if an engine fell out the captain
would ring for Mr. Allright.
The sun is just beginning to glow be-
hind the curtain of the east as he shep-
herds us all into the Douglas. In a
moment the stars of Ipswich shine in the
last of the night dusk, and all the wealth
of the Lockyer slides underneath us. We
seem scarcely aloft before we swing over
a ruffle of rising country like lace on the
edge of a gown, and all the patterned
Darling Downs expands to north and
south.
From the air it is even more like
Hungary than it is when seen from terra
firma. If it had the Danube it would be
a country, not a district. It sweeps be-
hind, and the grey airfield of Oakey
underneath tells us we are proceeding
to the “bush” by stages which are marked
by the tortuous lines of trees marking
the river-beds—here the Condamine, now
the Maranoa, now the Nive swinging
north. The swiftness of it is almost un-
believable to one who has made the
journey before in many ways.
At dawn we were in Brisbane on the
sea and coast. At 9 a.m. we are coming
down on a magnificent pattern of run-
ways in the red dust of Charleville—more
than 400 miles inland. Charleville itself
is just visible amid the strange western
foliage. It is the same old Charleville of
two generations, but in the first clear
heat of morning it seems unreal.
Dusty cars come out of it and snatch
up passengers, piles of Brisbane morning
newspapers and boxes of day-old chicks.
There are enough day-old chicks in the
DCS to stock a poultry-farm. By the end
of the day they will be spread over 1200
miles of Queensland.
We swing northward now. The sky is
perfectly blue, and., trails of dust career
across the landscape down below. The
’plane is as steady as a billiard-table ; no
motion save the forward thrust of the
engines.
This is the way to see the country if
you know it well. You can pick out all
the landmarks :• the Langlo, serpentining
in from the north ; far away westward
something that might be Adavale ; timber,
shining dams, Listowel Downs ; the dim
line of the ranges of the Bulloo; the
Barcoo country sliding past on your, left;
the. never-ending plains dreaming and
shimmering into the picture; a dusty
aerodrome at Blackall sitting m an
apparent desolation which in reality is
some of the richest country in Australia,
with Terrick Terrick hard aport just be-
fore you come in.
then more sunlit plains and Longreach,
looking little beside the two great mirage
cities, one of them complete with blue
harbor, which we have discovered on the
horizon. We have seen the Isis country
and the Wellshot-road, once one of the
wonders of these parts. And by 1 p.m.
we have spurred on to Winton, and have
glimpsed the lands of Darr River Downs,
and of Strathdarr, of Evesham, of Vindex
and Oondooroo and Elderslie as we
rise to sweep away towards the Mc-
Kinlays. The da'y is at its hottest, and
the machine barges through heat-pockets
with only the heave of a yacht facing a
light westerly on Sydney Harbor.
Then the ranges come up in a new
ruffle. New names crowd the broad
expanse of country seen in tiny clarity
down below Kynuna, Diamantina.
rivers and hills. A white dot here and
there marks a homestead in this land,
which in the pioneer days would have
been a six-months’ drove from our start-
ing place this morning.
We are passing out of the sheep-belt at
imperceptible speed—passing out of it
without having seen a sheep all day, nor,
indeed, any animal or living thing since
we left Archerfield save those chicks
and four nonchalant Winton goats and
the clusters of local humans on the aero-
dromes.
The stranger making this journey might
believe that all the shining west was un-
populated desert except for its rare
shimmering towns. But, in fact, it carries
16,000,000 sheep at its best, apart from
cattle ; it is a very mine of wealth.
The red Selwyns rise about 1.45 p.m.
Their serried ridges seem endless. What
mineral wealth they hold no man yet
knows. Cloncurry, sitting on its plateau
beside its shaded river and its magnifi-
cent military aerodrome, looks anything
but the capital of one of a continent s
richest mineral belts, the highlights of
whose geography are written down in
world-famous names Hampden, Mt.
Elliott, Mt. Cuthbert, Mt. Isa. We un-
load more day-old chicks here and notice
the Flying Doctor ’planes in the hangar.
Then up once more, this time steering
almost due west over serrated and
dangerous looking ridges. They lie in
lines like monsters moving north to south
as reefs should go. The air above them is
bumpy, and we are tossed about a little.
It is like passing out between Sydney
Heads.
We seem to be driving into an endless
desolation. Nothing but rock and spini-
fex behind ; nothing but saw-tooth ranges
in front. In the middle of it Mt. Isa
looms up. It is 3 p.m.
Qantas’s friendly agent, Mr. Boyd,
rescues us out of a cloud of dust. In
ten minutes we are drinking iced beer
on the balcony of the Argent, looking
across the cool, cement-bridged billabong
of the upper Leichhardt River system
reaches at a miracle of a mine. The beer
is amber. A rim of red dust settles round
the edge of the glass. A thousand galahs
rise from the trees along the waterhole
in the centre of the town. A dozen
hawks hover high in the limpid air. We
are, as the crow flies, 90 miles from the
Northern Territory border and 1200-odd
comfortable miles from where we were at
daylight. And it is not yet 4 p.m.
Over there to the south-west, not so
far out of sight, is the gap through which
(in the day of men still alive) Inspector
Urquhart, of the Native Police, took the
first wheeled vehicle to cross these ranges,
to found the ’Dangle.
Down the street go two of the last relics
of the savage Kalkadoons. They are
about ten years old, neatly dressed, fresh
from school, each with a large loaf of
bread under his arm.
It is hard to believe that they derive
some of their stamina from the rich diet
of Chinamen on which their grand-
parents flourished in the gold days of the
Territory, when John from Canton made
his way in droves through this country
from the Barkly and the Gulf.

PERSONAL ITEMS
One year ahead of his fellow nona-
genarian, Shaw, Isaac Isaacs celebrated
his 91st birthday last week by writing a
trenchant analysis of the Palestine prob-
lem. Only 20 years younger than the city
he was born in, he first saw the hgfit not
far from the Elizabeth-street post-office,
near where his father followed the calling
of tailor. Most of Melbourne had
rushed to the diggings, and Isaacs,
senior, followed his customers to Beech-
worth, The young man who was to be
Australia’s first native-born G.-G. got
most of his intellectual training from fiis
mother, and even the rough atmosphere
of the diggings didn’t prevent him carving
his way up through a schoolmaster’s job
to the Bar and to the Chief Justiceship
of tfie High Court, and King’s deputy at
Canberra. Isaac Isaacs’s mental powers
show no more deterioration than Shaw’s
do, and the sole survivor of Deakin’s
second (1905-08) Ministry could cut a
better figure in a Parliamentary broad-
cast than nine-tenths of present members.
Nobody need be misled by the large
and urgent figure of Don Shand, of
Armidale (N.S.W.), into believing that he
can’t be stopped. He might be encoun-
tered anywhere between the Kingaroy
peanut silos and a Collingwood football
match or passing the sugar to a radio
scout in a Noo York quick-lunch joint,
but he’ll stop with a jerk for anyone who
can creep up beside him and mutter,
“Ain’t got a. soybean about y’, boss?”
Shand is as much Australia’s apostle of
tjie vegetable as old Jack Moses was of
its wines, and Shand has as deep and
abiding a faith in his country as had
Moses. He’d been farming out of Armi-
dale for 20 years or so when he heard of
the soybean and its wonders—and they
are wonders—and he went for them in
a big way, quickly proved they could be
BEAN BOOSTER.
grown here, took his infectious grin to
Canberra and so convinced that sceptical
crowd that almost before he knew it he
emplaned for the U.S.A., where he looked
into the soybean industry, gathered facts,
figutes and a reel or two of technicolor
films, then flew back to Australia.
Shortly there followed at Armidale the
first National Soybean Manufacturers and
Growers conference, which drew dele-
gates from three States to be entertained
and instructed by Shand, and given a
dinner which had soybeans in it from the
soup to the sweets —they’d planned even
the ice-cream from soy, but the other
ingredients failed to turn up. As a result
the beans will be growing on New Eng-
land, around Kingaroy (Q.) and Orbost
and Maffra (Vic.) next year. That, Shand
believes, will be'merely a start, since the
soybean is the answer to the prayer of
farmers looking for new and payable
crops. He was hurtling through Sydney
when Prior yelled “Soybeans!” and
Shand stopped long enough for this sketch
to be made and to convert a few Bulle-
tin men to his mission.
Judge “Billy” Magennis, who has just
retired from the Victorian County Comt
Bench through ill-health, saved many a
young offender from becoming ac-
quainted with the inside of gaol by
sentencing him to imprisonment in his
own home ofter 8 o’clock each night for
a stated period. This must have been irk-
some to many parents as well as boys,
but it saved them the stigma of penal
incarceration. When Judge Magennis
was appointed in 1935 he was the third
Judge who had served his articles with
W. R. Rylah. A colleague remarked at
the. time that “if solicitors start making
such records they will soon be on a par
with successful trainers on the turf and
receive a rush of applicants.”
Yet another Queenslander to achieve
outstanding success in aviation matters is
Alfred Gordon Berg, of the Civil Avia-
tion Department, who has been appointed
to the staff of the Provisional Inter-
national Civil Organisation Secretariat.
Born at Croydon (N.Q.), in 1904, he
graduated in engineering at the Queens-
land Uni. and joined Brisbane Council’s
Electricity Supply Department. Later, he
spent some years in America with the
General Electric Co., and, returning to
Australia in 1933, became Superinten-
dent of Aircraft for the Civil Aviation
Board. Last year he visited Britain,
Canada and the United States to investi-
gate airworthiness matters, and in January
represented Australia at a conference in
Montreal. He will complete his investi-
gations for the Civil Aviation Department
before taking up his new . duties.
“Becks” on the new C.-in-C.:
To read the story of Sir Miles Dempsey is
to read the history of the war in Europe, with
a few chapters trom other theatres thrown in
for good measure, in September, 1939, Dempsey
went to France in command of the First Bat-
talion Berkshires and was soon given a brigade,
the 13th, which, as part of the Fifth Division,
was to play a gallant part in the Dunkirk cam-
paign. It was in the counter-attack on Arras,
which held up the Hun at a vital time and
gained some precious days for the sore-pressed
B.E.F. More important still was its three-day
stand on the \ pres-Comines Canal, where,
against enemy forces outnumbering it by five
to one, it fought the delaying action that made
Dunkirk possible. Three years later, after ser-
vice in Africa, Dempsey, now a major-general,
led the 13th Corps in the invasion of Sicily.
That was on July 10, 1943, and on Sept. 3 he
flung it ashore on Europe proper with an attack
on the toe of Italy. Tne corps fought its way
up the Apennines in a series of battles in
which the terrain was all in favor of the de-
fenders, and its advance opened the way to
the fall of Rome. By that time Dempsey had
gone on to bigger things—he was preparing for
the real invasion of Europe, in which he led
the Second Army to victory all the way from
the Normandy beaches to the Rhine, avenging
himself in full for those nightmare weeks of
1940. After the German collapse Dempsey suc-
ceeded General Slim at the head of the Four-
teenth Army in Burma in preparation for the
recapture of Singapore. The Japs surrendered
too soon for him to repeat his European saga
in Asia, and he became Commander Allied
Land Forces S.-E. Asia for a few months, leav-
ing that job to take over as C.-in-C. Middle
East. There was no accident about the
success of General Dempsey; he merely ran
true to form. In the First War he was a com-
pany commander in France at 19, with a Mili-
tary Cross to his credit, was battalion adjutant
when he was gassed in 1918, and in the fol-
lowing year dr inguished himself in the fighting
in north-west Persia. His new command comes
to him in his 50th year.
Recently appointed 8.0.A.C. repre-
sentative in Australia, Lieut.-Commander
A. D. S. Murray has had 13 years’ ser-
vice with Imperial Airways and its suc-
cessors in Britain, Europe, Middle and
Far East. A Scot, he was born in India,
and joined the Naval College in 1911,
going to sea as a middy in 1914. Served
throughout World War I, retiring from
the Navy in 1923 to take up sheep-
farming in Australia. Five years later
he joined the Civil Aviation Depart-
ment, and was responsible for the com-
pletion of the air route from Camooweal
to Daly Waters. Nineteen-twenty-nine
saw him in charge of maintenance of
Government aerodromes in W.A. Switch-
ing to Imperial Airways in, 1933 as

Morocco.
The Research Travelling Scholarship
granted by the Gowrie Scholarship Trust
Fund goes to Russel Tullie Madigan of
S.A., who leaves early next year for
Canada and the United States to carry
on research in underground ventilation
and air-conditioning in deep mines. Son
of Dr. C. T. Madigan, scientist, explorer
—Antarctic and Centralia —and lecturer
in geology at Adelaide Uni., young Madi-
gan won the Angas Engineering Scholar-
ship at 15, gained his B.Sc. with distinc-
tion in assaying and mining geology at
Adelaide Uni. in 1941, then served with
the Royal Australian Engineers in New
Guinea. In his Uni. days he won the
Lempriere Abbott Cup for boxing. He’s
An interesting development in Aus-
tralian historical research is the founding
at Roma (Q.) of the Sir Thomas Mitchell
Museum of Maranoa, and the formation
of a committee to seek for material of
local historical interest which might other-
wise be lost. Space for a collection has
been made available at the Roma High
School, and an appeal sent out for local
and other contributions. The Royal
Geographical Society has extended its
approval and backing to the movement.
The secretary of the committee is Miss
Hope Spencer, of Roma, who will wel-
come contributions and suggestions.
Melbourne legal men were astonished
to hear that James McConnell Kerr, the
Victorian solicitor who died early this
year, left an estate worth close on a
quarter of a million. A fortune like that
isn’t often made in Melbourne legal
offices. Most of this one wasn’t —it came
out of South African diamonds. Two
uncles discovered a mine in the Kim-
berley district. Kerr’s father joined them,
and later the family settled in Beech-
worth (Vic.). Benefactions during Kerr’s
lifetime almost equalled the remainder,
most of which goes to charitable insti-
tutions.
Never one to seek the limelight, Joe
Palmer, although 46, was with the
R.A.A.F. as instructor and ferry pilot
right through the war. He has recorded
some 2000 flying hours in that time, and
his logbook shows that he is entitled to
fly 52 different types of aircraft, which
must be a record for the service. An
Aero Club pilot, he offered his ser-
vices to the R.A.A.F. when war broke
out, and has done a job which, although
it has not earned him any gongs, has
won him the admiration and respect of
all who came in contact with him.
Wallace Reyburn, a Maoriland journa-
list now in Montreal, Canada, has col-
lected an 0.8. E. With the Canadians at
Dieppe he was wounded while landing
with the first of the Commando troops.
He won some kudos for his description
of that historic foray and was later
author of a war book.
The patriarchal visage and beard here
depicted by Dubois belong to a man who
was bom in Alsace in 1872, just after
that province had been torn from France
by Prussia, but who has been an adopted
Australian for nearly 50 years. Francis
Xavier Gsell, R.C. Bishop of Darwin,
came to this country in 1897 to teach
theology in a Sydney monastery, but soon
transferred his attention to missionary
work, first at Yule Island, Papua, and then
in the Northern Territory, where he be-
came administrator of the diocese in
1906 ; his bishopric is of more recent
creation —1938. Since 1911 he has been
director of the aboriginal mission station
on Bathurst Island. He has been father,
teacher and spiritual guide to the natives

there and knows far more about their
customs and traditions than most of those
who write on the subject. At present he’s
in holts with the sponsors of the plan for
a new order in Darwin who wish to
swallow the title deeds of his Church
lands and give him a lease in return.
U.S. Senator Leverett Saltonstall, who
attended the atom-bomb tests at Bikini as
a member of the President’s Evaluation
Board, and sandwiched in a short visit to
Australia, was born in 4892 at Newton,
Massachusetts, and educated at Harvard!
US. SENATOR.
After a period of artillery service in
France in World War I, he entered poli-
tics and has been there ever since. He
has been a member of the State Legisla-
ture for 14 years, Speaker of the House
for eight and in 1938 became first Repub-
lican Governor of a State that had always
been inveterately Democratic. Got into
the Senate in 1944 when Senator Lodge
died, and at the next elections walked in
on his own feet with a crushing majority.
All American papers refer to him as
“New England’s favorite son,” and his
family is one of Boston’s oldest and
richest. Among his ancestors he claims
eight former Governors of 'Massachu-
setts ; going further back, another was
Lord Mayor of London in the time of
Queen Bess, while another was Cromwell's
ambassador to Holland. Saltonstall,
depicted here without flattery by Tram, is
being talked of as a possible candidate
for the Republican Presidential nomina-
tion.
Into the silence:
In Adelaide, at 66, William Beerworth, former
Inspector of the S.A. Police Force. During 35
years’ service he was mounted constable at
Terowie and Waikerie, inspector of mounties at
H.Q. and had charge of the mid-northern divi-
sion when he retired in 1940.-
In Adelaide, at 55, Reginald McLeay, mer-
chant and exporter, brother of the Lord Mayor
of Adelaide and the Opposition-leader in the
Senate.
At Melbourne, at 83, Alfred Partington, one
of the founders of Cobb and Co.’s Drivers
Association. He drove in the Ballarat district
and later helped to build the Pine Creek rail-
way in the N.T.
At 81, in Melbourne, Malcolm McCaul
Brodie, senior partner of Sanderson and Co.,
once known world-wide in shipping circles. He
left a firm of Glasgow shipowners to join San-
derson’s in Melbourne in 1887. His collection
of photographs and relics of old windjammer
days has few equals.
In Sydney, at 91, George Barrow, veteran
newspaperman. One of the founders of the
A.J.A., he was an artist as well as a writer. His
water-colors were a feature of the decorations or
the old Press Club in Hamilton-street, and he
designed the original A.J.A. badge.
Walter Reed, dead in Adelaide at 92, was the
city’s oldest land-agent, and famous musically
in earlier days, especially with Cecil Sharp, the
English folk-song expert, who spent some years
in S.A.
Colonel Jack Irwin, dead at Mount Barker
(S.A.) at 52, was one of the foundation caoeb
at Duntroon. He was in the landing at Gallipoli
and won a D.S.O. in France; in the late war ne
was in charge of the garrison at Keswick ana
later at Darwin, and was A.D.C. for a tune to
the Governor-General. In private life he was a
successful stockbreeder.

Women's Letters
From Melbourne
Rhoda Taylor, public relations officer
for the Australian-American Association,
and Mrs, F. R. Wawn, daughter of J. H.
Rhodes, a council member of the Asso-
ciation, are planning big things to further
friendship with America. These include
a broadcast of songs written and sung by
Australians. Rhoda is also responsible
for a fortnightly news letter, sent out to
all broadcasting stations, which covers
every aspect of woman’s life in the
U.S.A. —fashions, home-making, interior
decorating and sundry allied spheres of
interest. The A.-A. Association is also
out to gain the co-operation of exporters
by stamping the goods they send to
America with a distinctively Australian
motif, preferably something in the line
of our native fauna.
“Banyule,” the Heidelberg home of Mr.
and Mrs. Herbert A. Allen, was a delight-
ful flower-decked setting for the luncheon
party given to members of the American
Women’s Auxiliary to the Children’s
Hospital. Mrs. Allen and her co-hostess
Mrs. A, E. Hotchkiss received Lady
Latham, president of the Children’s Hos-
pital, After* lunch Mrs. D, J. Evans,
treasurer of the American Women’s Auxi-
liary, handed Lady Latham a cheque for
£3OOO, which represented the auxiliary’s
efforts for the year—and a splendid effort
it was. The amount included the £1640
profit made from the Fourth of July
Ball. Later, at the request of Mrs. E.
Campbell, secretary of the auxiliary,
the C.J.’s wife presented life-governorships
of the hospital to two members of the
auxiliary—Mrs. Robert B. Bradley, who
is its president, and Mrs. John Cain.
Among the guests were Mrs. Richard
Boyce, wife of the U.S. Consul-General,
Mrs. Sauer, wife of Col. J. S. Sauer,
Assistant U.S. Military Attache, Mrs.
Bernard Briody, whose husband is doing
research work at the Walter and Eliza
Hall Institute, and Mrs. Tom Blarney.
The reception-room at Scott’s Hotel
was decorated with the tricolor when
members of the French colony of this
city gathered to say “au revoir” to Con-
sul General M. Raux, who is bound for
Batavia, where he will open the French
Consulate. Guests were greeted by M.
Loubere, Vice-Consul for France, and
then presented to the guest of honor. M.
D. Modesti and his wife, and Associate
Prof. Maurice Belz and his wife, were
there. Assistant Prof. Keith Macartney,
who has been prominent in all affairs spon-
sored by the French residents, received
congratulations for his successful pre-
sentation of “Antony and Cleopatra.”
His leading lady, Mrs. lan Potter, was
there, smart in a black suit and small
white straw hat, clustered with deep red
roses. M. and Madame Pohl came with
Madame Andree.
Congratulations were showered on Mr.
T. G. Gill at the party given to mark his
80th birthday. Mrs. T. Gill assisted
Alice Wyatt, who had lent her spacious
flat in Domain-road for the celebrations,
to receive the guests. Alice wore a gown
of steel-beaded black crepe with a short
matching jacket. Mrs. Rex Potter’s black
tulle featured an all-over design of tiny
gold sequins, with a tiny frill of the tulle
finishing the low bust line. Sophie
Groves sported a brand-new three-quarter
length silver fox cape, her wedding anni-
versary present. Mrs. Roy Honeyman,
whose crepe gown was of parma violet,
the sleeves and shoulders sewn with bur-
nished sequins and paillettes, has been
busy lately with Betty Stephens remodel-
ling hats given to them by friends and
to be sold at the coming fair to help the
funds of the Royal Melbourne Hospital.
With her black gown,' which had an
ecru lace yoke, Mrs. Norman Lynch
wore a three-quarter length silver fox
cape.
Speaking at a meeting of the United
Women’s Movement at the Heidelberg
Town Hall, Dr. Doris Officer supported
the establishment of a convalescent home
where mothers could be sent upon dis-
charge from hospitals. Red Cross aides
and V.A.Ds., under the direction of
infant welfare sisters and mothercraft
nurses, could efficiently care for the
mothers and their babies. Secretary of
the United Women’s Movement, Mrs. H.
A. Maine, has received offers of assist-
ance from retired nurses and other cap-
able women to run and staff a con-
valescent home. Two houses in the
Toorak district are under consideration,
but, as yet, no building has been inade
available.
Mrs. Charles Orr gave a big party at
her Toorak home to welcome home
her daughter Madeline after an extended
stay in Sydney. White camellias offered
a simple contrast to the hostess’s tailored
gown of black slipper satin ; Madeline’s
long draped gown of white jersey was
patterned with large royal blue flowers.
The Raymond Lamberts were there, she
in a sleek flame-colored crepe frock,
topped with a white fox cape. Peta and
Dick Bentley, with Joan Bushells, made
up a Sydney group. Singer Sylvia Fisher
wore black crepe with lashings of dia-
mente trimmings and a silver fox cape.
Dr. and Mrs. Hattam, assisted by their
daughters Eileen and Gwen, gave a party
at their Armadale home in honor of
Jean Wallace Mitchell and her fiance,
Dudley Gordon. The three hostesses
were all gowned in smart black en-
sembles. Crystal beads, in an unusual
design, highlighted the tunic top of Mrs.
S. Aarons’s black cocktail frock. Others
who came included Roberts Dunstan and
his wife; Mrs. Maxwell Thomas, at
whose wedding the guest of honor had
been a bridesmaid ; and the former Louise
Lovely was there with her husband, Bert
Cowan. Members of Mrs. Wallace Mit-
chell’s Younger Set at the party included
Joan Leggo and Nancy Woodrow.
Among the male escorts was William
Christensen, former squadron leader in
the R.A.A.F., who won thd D.F.C. and
bar with the famous Pathfinders.
Mr. and Mrs. T. Dowd and their son
Maurice entertained many friends and
members of their staff at a late-after-
noon party, held to celebrate the open-
ing of a new centre for corset production
in this city. Women guests were given
an opportunity of examining the newest
garments, which are well cut and of
shimmering satin and fine lace. All the
latest plant and accessories are to be
found in this factory, which features the
treatment of large window space and the
placing of machines to form a more social
feature of working hours. The machines
are set in small groups so that the fac-
tory atmosphere is to a large extent re-
placed by the one of the old sewing circle.
Social amenities for the girls who work
in the production of corsets loom high
in Mrs. Dowd’s plans for their better-
ment. Dances are held at regular inter-
vals. .
From Sydney
The Governor-General, the Duke of
Gloucester, and the Duchess had a busy
time in Sydney last week. The Duchess,
wearing her uniform as Colonel-in-Chief,
A.W.A.S., inspected a parade of members
of the Women’s Army Services at Victoria
Barracks. Miss Eileen Phipps, who at-
tended H.R.H., wore her uniform of
Junior Commander in the A.T.S. For
many members of the Women’s Army
this was the last parade. The exhibition
of the Australian Watercolor Institute was
visited by the Duchess. The Y.W.C.A.,
too, was honored by the Royal visitor,
who also earlier in the week gladdened
the hearts 6f the patients in the Home
for Incurables by paying them a visit.
At the Y.W-, H.R.H. was received by
the directors in the lounge and there was
a very smart guard of honor of girls in
navy and white gym uniforms. The
Duchess’s visit was timed for the educa-
tional classes, and she showed great in-
terest in all the activities, with perhaps a
little bias towards the millinery and pot-
tery. Her suit was mulberry in shade
and her trig hat was of velvet to tone.
Y.W.’s president Mrs. C. P. Johnson
wore russet browns. Mrs, Hope Gibson,
in black, got in a very pretty curtsey.
Nancy Moore, Mrs. Henry Pratt and
general secretary Alice Butler were other
Y. representatives.
Impressive ceremony of the week was
the investiture held by the Governor-
General in the Government House
grounds last Friday morning, when
H.R.H. decorated 125 servicemen and
-women. The Duchess, the State’s new
Governor John Northcott and Mrs.
Northcott were present. Later the Duke
visited the War Veterans’ Home at Narra-
been.
Clement Hosking must have been up
early to pluck the great posy of violets
and snowdrops which rested on the
Duchess of Gloucester’s programme.
This in turn rested on the balustrade of
the balcony in front of her seat at the
opening of the Folk, Lore Festival. The
doings were in the Town Hall, and wove
vivid pattern on the floor of the concert
hall. Spectators were mainly in the gal-
leries looking down. It was rather like
looking at an animated map. Here were
braw Scots, here were Dutch, Czechoslo-
vakian, Pole and Greek and all the other
people of other lands sturdily surviving
in spite of wars and tears. And every-
where was the cream tunic of Legacy,
The Duchess was graceful in a Chinese-
red dinner frock; her hip-length coat of
white Arctic fox was soft as a cloud.
There was a guard of honor, very Scots,
and the organisers of the festival and an
official group from Legacy received her.
Presentations were made to her in one
of the Mayoral rooms. On her departure
a guard of honor stretched from 'the
Town Hall foyer to the bottom of the
steps. Folk Lore’s president Clement
Hosking escorted H.R.H. to her car.
Melbourne pianist Margaret Schofield,
who will be heard in Sydney during the
Kurtz season, is here pictured. She will
be accompanist to the famed Russian
’cellist, who is touring Australia under
A.B.C. direction.
They could have, but they haven’t,
launched a thousand ships, and in-
deed the only ships they saw for
many years must have been those
which the Victorian writers referred to as
“the ships of the desert,” but they are
three of the most delightful women
Sydney has met for many a long day.
Their names are Mildred Cable and Evan-
geline and Francesca French, and they
represent the British and Foreign Bible
Society. The Misses French are Irish,
and have the buoyancy of that land.
Wasn’t it Cromwell’s legions who spoke
of the Bible in one hand and the sword in
the other? Well, these ladies have cer-
tainly carried the Bible through Northern
China, but it wasn’t the sword they
carried in the other hand, but the lance
of wit. They are the easiest women to
talk to, and the listener feels that there
are probably more oases in the Gobi
Desert for their passing.
’file Lady Mayoress gave a reception
for them last week, and her drawing-
rooms had one of their most crowded
afternoons. Mrs. Denham and Dr.
Taylor, from China, were among the
guests. Ruby Board was there talk-
ing phonetics to the Miss French
who has written a book on Chinese
phonetics. From Killara came Mrs.
Harold Bott, Mrs. Hope Gibson and
Mrs. N. Taplin, loath to fling aside
the fur of winter, but bursting into spring
rhythm about the hat. Mrs. E. Wunder-
lich was noted ; Mrs. Keith Morris talked
to Mrs. Hubert Fairfax and Mrs. Simp-
son Lee. The Anderson lady was
there ; so were Mrs. Ted Scorfield and
Mrs. Florence Taylor and Mrs. Lorenz
in a slim-fitting white coat. Mayoress
Bartley’s mink cape was much admired.
Miss Evangeline French doesn’t mind a
black sheep in the family. She wore a
black Tibetan lamb-skin coat. Miss
Francesca wore with her suit a Tibetan
fox necklet. It was blonde, silkily-fine,
and crossed with the most delicate tawny
markings.
Like the thoroughbreds they are,
members of City Tattersall’s are standing
by the ladies. Their ball last night was
in aid of the Nurses’ Memorial Fund.
This was held in the Trocadero, and if
you believe in horseshoes for luck (and
everyone there did) you can expect to
pick the winners right up to Christmas.
The whole scheme of the decorations was
the horseshoe. The club’s colors, blue
and gold, flashed brightly among the table
decorations. There were 1200 dancers,
and tickets were one guinea each, so there
will be quite a cheque to hand over.
Chairman George Herdsman and Mrs.
Herdsman and Mr. and Mrs. Cornwall
received the official guests. Among these
were the Premier arid Mrs. McKell, the
Lord Mayor and Mrs. Bartley, the Tom
Watsons, Sydney Turf Club’s Mr. Hill,
Speaker of the House Rosevear, Inspector
Walsh and his wife and Senator Ashley.
Secretary E. Byron’and Mrs. Byron, and
treasurer H. G. Schachtel, and the Harry
Samuels couple were in the official group.
The Girl in the Flat Opposite will call
it “The Australian Woman’s Chatter,”
and certainly the conference did pitch a
few more thousand, words into the
already palpitating atmosphere. The
conference brought delegates from many
other countries; from India (very dis-
tinguished-looking these ladies), from
France, from China, from Maoriland. On
Friday the- delegates from Russia had
still not arrived. Dame Mary Gilmore
launched the talks, the day being her
81st birthday. The day sessions were
held in the Y.W.C.A. hall and evening
lectures were given in the Assembly Hall
in Margaret-street. As was natural, the
better deal for woman was the core of
the. whole thing—woman in the home, in
jail, in business, in divorce (domicile
again), in the throes of buying a house
on a bank loan.
Thursday afternoon’s opening talk,
on housing, was given by Mrs. Phyllis
Burke, As a prologue one of the
missionary Miss Frenches gave a snappy
little picture of life in the Gobi
Desert —a place where women have
even a worse deal, and where there is
presumably as great a shortage of hous-
ing as in this State. If you were a wife
and mother who had been waiting a
couple of years or so for a home of
your own, the Government plan for hous-
ing the people must have sounded like a
fairy story, or maybe just a pipe dream.
Latest communiques from the front-
line tell of great preparations' for the
R.S.L. Victory Ball. General John
Northcott, Governor of N.S.W., and Mrs.
Northcott will attend and will receive
20 attractive debs. Date, August 20.
Place, Trocadero.
Everybody knows Georges Thill’s
records, and already Sydney Town Hall is
being booked out for the two concerts
he will give here. Georges was a very
young pilot towards the end of World
War I (he is now in the forties). He is
decorated with the Croix de Guerre and
the Legion of Honor. From Australia
he goes to South America.
When Eugene Goossens lifted the
barrier the symphony orchestra got off
to a good start in the Tschaikowsky Sym-
phony in B Minor (the Pathetique) last
Saturday night. The Town Hall audience
quickly fell under the spell woven by the
conductor and his forces. Then after the
interval had quietened the tingle of that
experience, the orchestra and Edmund
Kurtz were very happy together in Elgar’s
Concerto in E Minor. In spite of hourly
services, skeleton services and other trans-
port discomforts the audience was tightly
packed.
All the A.B.C. generals and their
wives—among these pretty Mrs. C. J.
Moses—and chiefs-of-staff were there.
Mrs. Hope Gibson and her mother Mis.
Denmark were among congratulators who
went backstage after the concert. Dr.
Ben Edye, his wife and daughter Benoni
were there, but without pretty Stephanie,
who had left that morning by the Orbita
for London. Mrs. Ernest Lashmar,
singer Evelyn Lynch and the wife of
Professor Fawsitt talked over the just-
published “Wedding Song,” by Mrs.
Fawsitt.
A mass murder has been arranged.
There will be dead marines all over
the place when the United Services
Institution holds its late-afternoon cele-
bration on August 16. This is, of course,
a V.J.-Day celebration, and it’s going to
be good. There were, naturally, no
parties at that address during the war,
and this will be the first one since. A
glass of milk or of tomato juice is said
to be the steadying foundation.
Everybody seem£ to be reading it.
More than 200 copies were sold
over. the counter the first day that
Melbournite Rohan Rivett’s Behind
Bamboo appeared in Angus and Rob-
ertson’s. The book tells of torture,
courage and endurance throughout years
of Japanese captivity. It tells the story
of what the Australian p.-0.-w. had to
endure. In it the unbelievable horrors
of the Burma-Siam railway days and
nights are recounted with a coolness that
makes them all the more horrible. Here
is a paragraph:
In the “Speedo” period (Burma-Siam
railway) men worked from dawn right
through the day and on until the small
hours of the following morning, some-
times doing this day after day for weeks
on end. In many camps it became the
regular thing for shifts to last 16, 20, 24
and even, on one occasion, 36 hours.

This is the largest motor-assembly,
distribution and body-building business
in the Commonwealth, and a highly
efficient and prosperous organisation it
is, too. It fused in 1930 the interests of
General Motors (Aus.) Pty,—set up in
1926 to assemble the chassis units of its
American parent—and Holden’s, the big
motor-body builders at Woodville, near
Adelaide. Losses totalling £869,109
showed up for the 2{- years to end 1932.
That was because the co. was caught with
heavy stocks on a falling market; jazzing
currencies did the rest. Five years later
profits exceeded a million pounds, and
an 81.2 p.c. div. (£784,200) was capital-
ised by issue of a like amount of ord.
scrip. Thus paid capital became
£2,311,600 in 561,600 6 p.c. cum. prefs.
and 1,750,000 ords., which are held
mostly by the American parent.
Failure of earnings to keep abreast of
the pre-1939 level reflects the impact of
war. Net results averaged £311,502 for
the five years to end 1944, compared
with an average of £796,025 for the pre-
ceding quinquennium. During the war
sales of motor vehicles and accessories
were practically confined to the services
and Government departments, and the
co. turned to production of guns, air-
craft, munitions, etc. To what purpose
the following table shows;

It was a remarkable achievement con-
sidering the difficulties connected with
plant, production technique and skilled
labor that had to be overcome. Nearly
a million pounds was spent on additions
to fixed assets, and plant and works were
reorganised in a new set-up. Now it all
has to be'reconverted to a fresh lay-out
to meet requirements of the civilian
market by efficient mass-production
methods. And no time has been lost
in the process.
There was a contraction of £3,668,313
in turnover from all sources (£6,686,843)
last term, and a net trading loss of £68,528
showed up. Chief contributing factors
were (1) shortage of essential chassis
components, which stood in the way of
producing motor vehicles, (2) cost of
terminating defence contracts, and (3) the
time required for and cost of plant re-
conversion, etc. The ords., which
averaged 28.2 p.c. for the preceding seven
years, were passed by.
As for the current term, delivery of
cars in the Australian market is behind
schedule, because of interrupted over-
seas production and priorities in the home
markets of countries concerned. Mean-
while, a heavy demand for replacements
and new vehicles awaits satisfaction. The
fly in the ointment is the steep rise in
prices (50 p.c. and more above pre-war
figures). To what extent this is likely to
retard the volume of sales remains to be
seen. It is doubtful whether any sub-
stantial drop in-price need be looked for
until British and U.S. manufacturers get
mass production into full swing again.
Locally the most important develop-
ment in the industry is the co.’s decision
to manufacture an all - Australian,
medium-sized car in the lower-price
group. It is expected to come off the
production lines about the end of 1947.
The engine is to be machined and put
together at Fishermen’s Bend (Port Mel-
bourne), where a start has already been
made to install £1,157,000 worth of new
plant and equipment. The bodies and
some chassis sheet-metal pressings will
be turned out at Woodville. Here a
£750,000 expansion programme, including
pressing and welding equipment, is in
hand. Some raw materials and semi-
processed components are to be drawn
from firms in N.S.W. and other States.

is due partly to disclosure of an inventory
reserve of £203,910. The year’s improve-
ment in the more or less liquid surplus
(£2,343,684) was £12,536.

Considering the non-essential character
of many of the lines it handles, this co.
put up an encouraging performance
during the war years. Specialising in
sale of sporting goods, it does a large
turnover in tobacco, radios, haircuts and
a variety of oddments as well, runs a
chain of city shops and has strong con-
nections among suburban retailers and
sporting bodies. Rationing of tobacco,
restriction of use of rubber in sporting
goods and dearth of other lines, such as
radios and fishing tackle and the ban
on sale of firearms and ammunition, all
combined to reduce turnover —sales got
a temporary lift in 1942, owing largely to
the spending of American troops. And
the imposition of price ceilings and rise
in costs, including taxation, narrowed
profit margins. It is all reflected in a
contraction of net earnings, which
averaged £11,199 for the six years to the
close of accounts in 1945, compared with
an average of £13,768 for the preceding
quinquennium.
Last term there was a partial relaxa-
tion of controls, a few more of the goods
the co. handles became available, there
was a revival of sporting fixtures, and
demand generally strengthened as de-
mobilisation gathered way. The shortage
of tobacco, which has ensured a ready
market for all grades, has not adversely
affected earnings. Government ration-
ing of the stuff was discontinued from
end March last; but manufacturers and
others in the trade decided to continue
distribution on the basis of the official
quota until production got more into line
with demand. A gradual improvement in
supplies is anticipated, the board says.
Shortage of suitable female labor is at
the root of the supply problem.
The year’s brisker trading added
£21,945 to gross earnings:—.
1939. 1942. 1945. 1946.
Gross profit .. £154,975 £178,808 £126,671 £148,616

Net profit .. £14,979 £11,087 £14,585 £21,296
Including an unspecified provision for
taxation, exes, took £15,234 oi me gam.
That left the net result £6711 stronger at
£21,296, and only once in the last 21
years has better than that been shown—
that was in 1927, when the figure was
£22,053. The £21,296 was 12.8 p.c. on
capital as against 8.8, 6, 6.4, 6.6, 6.9, 5.5
and 9 p.c. back to 1939. The div., which
was lifted a couple of points in 1945,
was kept at 7 p.c., and a 2 p.c. bonus was
added, making 9 p.c. for the year. The
£6389 that was left lifted the lay-by
£43,390 in excess of goodwill (£22,110),
not treated as an asset herein.
The next table illustrates, among other
things, the difficulty the co. has experi-
enced in securing stocks (up £3783 last
term), which are still £52,934 short of the
1938 figure:—

The strong cash holding (up £25,077 last
term) places the management in a favor-
able position to stock-up with whatever
it considers good-selling lines when they
become available.
The immediate outlook favors main-
tenance of a high level of earnings. What
the more distant future holds for the co.
will partly depend upon the course of
competition, which has been very severe
at times. The £.-p. pound shares are
jammed at the ceiling price of 235. 3d.
on the market. The return at 235. 3d. is
7.7 p.c. on a 9 p.c. div. basis, or 6 p.c. on
a 7 p.c. distribution. The cover is 255. Id.

During the last half of the 1945 term
4s. a share (=£50,000) was returned to
those on the register in cash. That re-
duced paid capital to £200,000 in 250,000
shares of 16s. each. It had no effect on
the co.’s merchandising transactions nor
on the earning power of the business.
What it did do was make payment of a
higher rate of dividend on the reduced
capital an easy matter; and shareholders
were fortunate if they found anything
approaching equally profitable employ-
ment for the capital returned to them.
The business, built up largely by the
Rudds, has its, roots in Queensland
pioneering days. Its growth has kept
step with the development of agricul-
tural, pastoral and mining activities in
the centre and central-west of the State,
with which connections have been estab-
lished from Rockhampton headquarters.
There is also a branch at Brisbane and
another at Sydney, where the manage-
ment withdrew from the difficult dry-
goods trade about four years ago. The
financially conservative board has always
followed a cautious policy, one aim being
to underpin the structure against the
possible effects of drought and other
economic misfortunes.
During the war spending by our own
and Allied troops —the U.S. 41st Divi-
sion had its headquarters at Rockhamp-
ton for a while—largely offset the effects
of rationing, price fixing, rising costs,
transport and other difficulties. And
when turnover eased, as the troops moved
further north, the management was able
to pull exes, back:

Last term more goods became available,
and there was no difficulty in selling
them to a still hungry civilian market,
notwithstanding the dry conditions that
prevailed, and still prevail, throughout
the centre and west of the State. Exes,
took £17,609 of the gain. After allow-
ing £1095 for depreciation, shown as
written off in the introductory table, the
net result (£31,252) was £3474 stronger
at 15.6 p.c. on capital. The div. was
kept at 9 p.c., but the bonus was lifted

The year’s growth of £29,476 in book
debts reflects the reviyal of civilian trade.
Cash and book debts together more than
covered outside liabilities, including the
tax reserve. Investments, which include a
wad of Government securities, were equal
to 455. 7d. per pound of paid capital.
The 16s. shares are jammed at the ceil-
ing price of 43 s. on the market. The
return at 435. is 5 p.c. on a 13y p.c.
distribution, or 3.7 p.c. on a 10 p.c. basis.
At the Gt. Boulder meeting in Lon-
don, chairman Ellerton Binns said a dis-
appointing feature of last year’s develop-
ment was the fall in values in the No. 2
winze, Hamilton shaft section, on the
2950 ft. and 3100 ft. levels. These work-
ings are at the north end of the property
and are some 450 ft. deeper than else-
where in the mine. Development on the
2950 ft. horizon shows improved results
compared with the previous year. No.
16 ore shoot, for example, lengthened to
240 ft. in the leader as against 78ft. in the
level just below. But further improve-
ment must take place if values at this
level are to be restored to the average
of those at and above 2800 ft. A start
has been made to sink Edwards shaft, at
the south end of the mine, from 2650 ft.
to 3100 ft. This should open up a large
tonnage of new ore and at the same time
resolve the doubtful position in No. 2
winze area of Hamilton workings. Above
2600 ft. prospects are encouraging.

The war-time agreement under which
South Kalgurli ore was handled by
Kalgurli Ore Treatment Co.’s plant
on the Boulder Perseverance mine
has ended, and Croesus Prop, mill,
owned jointly by South Kalgurli
and North Kalgurli, is now doing
the job. At present throughput is about
5000 tons a month, which is South Kal-
gurli’s full capacity. Later it is proposed to
enlarge the plant and treat North Kalgurli
ore as well. The whole of North Kalgurli’s
ore is now treated by Kalgurli Ore Treat-
ment Co., which is jointly owned by
North Kalgurli and Boulder Perseverance.

London-controlled Corderoy Mines,
Ltd., operating on the Pilbarra field
(W.A.) announces that the balance of its
unissued capital (£6950 stg.) has been
taken up at par and that the debentures
have been repaid. The boring pro-
gramme recommended by the co.’s en-
gineers had been successfully com-
pleted. It is proposed to offer 505,000
new Is. shares at par, one for four.
Those to whom the new shares are
allotted are to receive option certificates
entitling them to take up, before June
30, 1948, one more Is. share at Is. 6d.
each for every share allotted in the forth-
coming issue, which has been under-
written.

Sterling Gold, N.L. (W.A.), says it
has struck rich ore in the Makeale gold
mine at Kintore, north of Coolgardie.
Earlier this year the co. took an option
over this property and made a call of
3d. a share. Gold Fields Australian De-
velopment held an option over the show
between 1937 and 1940, but didn t exer-
cise it. Sterling Gold was originally
formed to operate at Marie’s Find, near
Southern Cross, on the Yilgarn field, and
paid a 3d. dividend in 1940. It hasn’t
made a distribution since.
* * * *
Sons of Gwalia’s profit for 1945 at
£34,789 is down and dividend at Is. 3d.
per 10s. share is up. For 1944 the figures
were £41,633 and Is. a share respectively.
In 1939 the div. was ss. a share, or 50 p.c.
Last year provision for taxation took
£15,500 as against £20,000 in 1944. The
bottom levels of the cp.’s goldmine at
Leonora (W.A.) are stared to be looking
well.

A Sydney man is applying for a licence
to re-treat 250,000 tons of residues on the
long-shut-down Cosmopolitan goldmine
at Kookynie (W.A.). Property was
worked for some years by a London co.,
which gave up when values fell below
payable grade. The Cosmopolitan was
the mainstay of Kookynie, once a busy
mining camp, but now almost deserted.
• * * *
Prime-Minister Chifley has given an
assurance that facilities now available for
smelting, assaying, refining and issuing
gold at the Perth Mint will not be with-
drawn under any arrangement for the
establishment of a Mint at Canberra.
This assurance is welcomed in the West,
where it is claimed the Perth Mint has
established “a world-wide reputation for
its product,” and to credit
and prestige to the State.”
* * *
To encourage the production of base-
metals, in Westralia, particularly lead, the
Commonwealth Government has been
asked to exempt profits from such pro-
duction from taxation. There are already
some provisions for the recovery of capi-
tal expenditure in mining propositions,
and there is also one for a rebate of a
proportion of tax on sums paid as calls
to ventures mining for gold, silver, base-
metals or oil.
*** * .
Shortage of explosives for mining at
Kalgoorlie and elsewhere in Westralia is
stated by a spokesman of the Chamber
of Mines to be still serious. Arrange-
ments have been made to rail weekly
600 cases from Nobel’s Victorian factory,
but this represents only 40 per cent, ot
requirements.
* ♦ * *
Westralian Mines Department proposes
to use portable rock drills for prospecting
some of the goldmining areas in the State.
Power in the shape of mobile air-com-
pressors is being obtained from the Com-
monwealth Government. Unexploited
auriferous belts are to be tested in thi
way. _

Coolgardie Brilliant (W.A.) is (1)
making a call of 2d. a share, payab e
August 14, (2) mining and treating a
small shoot of payable ore, which is ex-
pected to yield a “reasonable profit,
and (3) obtaining a geological report and
seeking advice as to whether the co.s
mine (the Waratah) warrants diamond
drilling at depth. Meanwhile, share-
holders are still hoping that some return
of capital in the shape of dividends,
promised from time to time, may some
day come their way.

SUNDRY SHOWS
SOME SYDNEY PAINTERS.
Herbert R. Gallop’s watercolors and
oils (Royal Art Society’s Gallery, Sydney)
are pleasant and colorful. In the water-
color “The Valley” the light pours pleas-
ingly through the picture, dimming the
central hills and making the crops a
warm yellow; flanking blue hills, green
fields, trees and shadows give the picture
a nice balance. Several times, in various
guises, the artist attempts the same effect,
but it is more effective in watercolor
than in oils —some of the flashing tech-
nique is more suited to that medium. In
“Morning Light,” an ambitious oil, the
light slants over the tops of trees and
shimmers over the sea in a wide path. A
good and striking effect, but in a large
canvas something more than a ray of
light is needed.
Other paintings show a number of
faults —“Duncan’s Boatshed, Tuggerah,”
is colored nicely, but is no better than a
magazine illustration. “The Coast to
Avoca” has an inky sea, and on several
canvases the artist has had difficulty with
clouds.
Clouds, those vaporous stumbling
blocks to artists who treat them as solids,
have also had Leonard Long in difficul-
ties. There is a promise, however, in his
exhibition at the Grosvenor Galleries
that he will overcome the problem. He
has partially overcome the difficulties of
interpreting a large sweep of country,
with due deference to topographical
fidelity, in his large “Shoalhaven” (loaned
for the exhibition by H.M.A.S. Shoal-
haven). In his treatment of the gleam-
ing reach of water Long has shown
his capabilities, taking a step from re-
production towards landscape painting
in the real sense of the word. He achieves
some fine cloud reflections in water, and
repeats the method in other paintings.
The faults of his work are stiffness and
flatness and a tendency to lay paint on
in crude patches.
* * * *
Most of the paintings hung at David
Jones’s for the second annual exhibition
of the Sydney Group were exercises in a
fashionable folly. The exceptions were
some paintings of women by Paul Hae-
fliger and “Street in Marseilles” by Eric
Wilson. Wilson’s work was smoothly
painted—there were greasy streaks of
paint, but they were placed on houses
where they were fitting.
The least successful of Haefliger’s
women, “Mariana,” also had too much
paint and clumsy hands, which gave her
a stiff and unnatural look, as though the
artist had attempted unsuccessfully to re-
peat the technique of “L’lngenue” and
“Annette.” The faults of “Mariana” are
latent in the others, too, in the emphasis
on the hands, and in a kind of heavy
subtlety. But they—“LTngenue” particu-
larly—are clear studies of a type of
mature womanhood, and despite the
heaviness there is some subtlety and a
good use of color, giving a soft and
natural tone to the flesh.
David Strachan has a lifeless “Greek
Girl” and a “Sick Girl” embel-
lished by a sick green sky. Jean Bellette
seems to have scores of paintings, some
of which are familiar. One, a “Still-
Life Sketch,” is a vivid little patch of
color, interesting in itself, but bearing
no close relationship to its subject, a
bowl of flowers.
Circus in Town.
Wirth’s has come to Sydney; and, as
always, the show is altogether charming.
It looks as a circus ought to 100k —the
enormous tent pitched on green grass, the
colored lights, the caravans; it smells
delicately of lions and sawdust; it re-
sounds with animals and clowns, with
garish music, the uproar of children, and
—mysteriously in the tent where the six-
legged cow lives —with the subdued honk-
ing of geese.
And it behaves like a real circus.
Hordes of uniformed attendants, almost
a show in themselves, rush into the ring
between acts and rush out again bran-
dishing, mats, mallets, chairs, wheels,
ladders, billiard tables, all the astounding
paraphernalia with which jugglers and
acrobats surround themselves. So many
somersaults are turned, even by a cocka-
too and a motor-bike, that one almost
expects the venerable Alice, a she-ele-
phant nine years older than Bernard
Shaw, to follow suit. And Alice almost
does.
There is, it is true, no high trapeze act,
that most graceful of all circus spectacles ;
and, two of the original troupe having
departed, the continental clowns’ “tumul-
tuous triumph of tomfoolery” has lost a
little of its savor. But only a little. The
inimitable Oscar remains, and he is cap-
ably supported ; and two new Australian
clowns, who do frightful things to a
steak-and-kidney pudding, are really very
funny.
On the whole, though it would be un-
gracious to forget the small, handsome
girl who bounces like a rubber ball, and
the gentleman who spends the whole
night eating fire and breathing smoke, the
show is strongest in its animal acts:
notably Miss Gladys Wirth’s display of
horsemanship, the performing cockatoos,
Michael Wislang and his lions, a per-
formance by six white ponies, and the
riding of a scooter by a dog named
Barko, who, judging by his expression of
ineffable superiority, admires himself
quite as much as he ought to.
jj;
“The Switchback”
Ray Lawler played the part of the
country g.p. who discovers a cure for
tuberculosis and reverses all the accepted
views of the medical profession in James
Bridie’s “The Switchback,” presented for
the first time in Australia by the National
Theatre, Melbourne. Mr. Lawler was
thoroughly convincing, both when hand-
ling the rustic patients on whom he had
tested his theories, and when inveighing
against his opponents—the president of
the Royal Association of Medicine, who
can’t believe that an epoch-making ad-
vance can come out of a g.p.’s study ; the
newspaper magnate, who sees a chance
of making a great scoop; and the eminent
financier, who scents an opportunity for
putting a new cure on the market.
Like Maugham, Cronin and George
Sava, Bridie is himself a doctor and the
sincerity of his play compensates for its
roughness. The g.p.’s final diatribe
against his colleagues and orthodoxy be-
fore he goes off on a new quest to
Palmyra is Shavian in its dialectic as well
as its length, but has more of human
passion in it Mr. Lawler delivered it as
if he felt it.
He was well backed by Alan Matheson,
Paul Maloney and Alfred Davidson as
the trio of old fogies. Roma Joy
Williams, as the doctor’s wife bored with
rural life, gave a more stereotyped per-
formance. •
“Twelfth Night’ 1
“Twelfth Night” is a'pleasant play, and
the first night at Sydney Independent was
a success, despite some time-lag between
curtains and some censoring of Shak-
speare. The success was largely due to
the lively clowning scenes, with Jack
Kennedy as Sir Toby Belch, Desmond
Properjohn as Feste, John Craig as
Fabian, and Brian Farmer as Sir Andrew
Aguecheek. It was a pity that some of
Feste’s remarks were inaudible and that
Sir Toby was sometimes hesitant with his
lines. Gordon Lishman did a good job
as Malvolio and Verity Marina, as Maria,
was good. Kathleen Drake as Olivia was
disappointing, but Diana Perryman did
full justice to the part of Viola, at times
carrying the rest of the players with the
fire and vigor of her acting. As a boy
she swaggered convincingly, then, with
the softest of touches, changed to a
feminine personality. And then back
again.
* * * *
The Radio Players made a good job of
Paul Osborn’s “The Vinegar Tree” at
Bryant’s Playhouse, Sydney. A well-
balanced comedy-farce with touches of
satire, it is based on false sentiment and,
in part, on situations as old as Balzac’s
“The Danger of Being Too Inno-
cent.” Therese Desmond was outstanding
as Laura Merrick, the sentimental mother
who cherishes the memory of an ancient
love affair.
« _
Melbourne’s marathon of music has
resumed at the Town Hall, where Eugene
Goossens shared with pianist Volterra
the honors of three fine concerts of ex-
alted music, from the “Jupiter” sym-
phony of Mozart to Tschaikowsky’s melo-
dious Concerto No. 1 in B Flat Minor.
Those who like the light or near classics
got all they wanted at the first concert of
the “Music for Millions” series, purveyed
by the Sydney Light Orchestra under
Henri Krips’s baton. Tschaikowsky’s
“Swan Lake” and Grieg’s Concerto in A
Minor figured in the procession, with that
excellent pianist Paul Schramm at the
Steinway.
At the Talkies.
The opening scenes of “From This Day
Forward” —a soldier (Mark Stevens)
talking to his wife (Joan Fontaine) in the
street and then strolling with a sailor to
an employment bureau —are so natural
that they are almost startling. Thereafter,
in a retrospective story of marriage, un-
employment and life in a tenement dis-
trict, the realism declines as sentiment
rises, and characters, story and setting
take on the wistful, sentimental quality
and some of the charm —of an O. Henry
story. Sydney Mayfair.
Speed, color and humor are the essence
of “Easy To Wed” (Sydney St. James).
A young socialite (Esther Williams) sues
a newspaper for libel to the tune of two
million dollars and, since it hasn’t a leg
to stand on, the paper bribes one of its
staff (Van Johnson) to compromise the
lady. The plot’s as light as thistledown,
but it’s kept well afloat by the pace and
smart humor and a tiptop performance
by a fiery-headed and fiery-tempered
Lucille Ball.
The private life of inventor Hiram
Maxim is the alleged subject of “So Goes
My Love” (Sydney Lyceum), According
to the film the man delighted in such
pranks as hopping off horse trams to
throw confetti at weddings simply because
he “liked throwing things at people,” and
christening his son Percy and making
him wear a fine crop of long curls to
ensure that the boy would get plenty of
practice with his fists. The film is mildly
amusing in spots, but Myrna Loy is not
comfortable in the role of Maxim’s wife,
and Don Ameche’s acting is nailed to-
gether like a job of carpentry.
James Mason lurks in a gloomy old
mansion on the Yorkshire moors in “The
Night Has Eyes” (Sydney Victory), and
glowers, wrings his hands and sweats over
the memory of his mental blackouts dur-
ing which he strangles Pomeranians,
monkeys and other sma’ things. A pretty
young schoolteacher vanished in the
locality a year earlier and her friend, even
prettier, who comes investigating develops
a strong interest in Mr. Mason’s tortured
personality. Crime receives its final retri-
bution by being sucked down into one of
the bogs on the moors, a scene calculated
to send all small boys in the audience
cowering behind their seats until the last
bubbles have risen through the ooze.
Aye, but it’s grim.

SPORTING NOTIONS
YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
Reaching his best form at a propitious time
for his party, Victory March won the Australian
Steeplecnase at Caulfield, with Godfrey up.
The old fellow had been second twice—to
Spirak in 1942 and to Tente last year.
Of a fairly good field of 14, including two
previous winners of the race as well as the
winners of two Grand Nationals, only seven
got over the 29 fences and completed the
journey.
The first to go was the early leader Tanakee,
who went within an ace of bringing Victory
March down with him. Jocularity then took
up the running, and streaked away to a lead ot
a dozen lengths, crashing through fences with
the ease and grace of a bulldozer, and giving
his rider, Dummett, a thoroughly, unpleasant
time.
Near the nine-furlongs post jockey and
stirrups parted company, and Dummett was
hard put to it to stick on for the next couple
of furlongs. When the partnership was re-
sumed Jocularity was beginning to tire and six
furlongs from home he had to he pulled up.
Victory March went to the front, and, though
tackled in turn by Walladale and then Quix-
otic, there was daylight between him and
Quixotic at the finish.
Victory March went out at 10 to 1, Gay
Fort beipg a 3-to-l favorite, with Quixotic
next at fives. Gay Fort was a dreadful dis-
appointment.
In other races at Caulfield recent good form
was reproduced. The Grand National winner
Solvent (Smart) atoned for his failure in the
Australian Hurdle by winning the Arkaringa
Hurdle from Prince Danilo and Salvo, but he
gave his supporters some anxious moments.
Nearly down at the six, he came into the
straight a long way behind Prince Danilo, and
at the end there was so little between the pair
that the judge discreetly left it to the camera
—an unusually close finish for a jumpers’ race.
Despite a substantial rise in the weights First
In was first in again in the Malakorf Stakes,
defeating Coin and Macclesfield. The mare
from Maoriland was ridden by the Maoriland
jockey Didham, who is taller than Pike. First
In is now in request for the Caulfield Cup.
Another last-start winner to repeat the dose
was the Windbag gelding Lone Wind (Snart)
a half-length too good for Tamerlane and
Medicine in the first division of the St. Aubin
Handicap, seven furlongs. It is almost 21 years
since Windbag, then a four-year-old, carried
9.2 to win the Melbourne Cup in record time,
yet the progeny of Magpie’s son, now dead, go
on winning.
One particularly interesting result at Caul-
field was the Cambria Plate,' nine furlongs, in
which the favorite Black Law (Badger) had a
narrow win from Anstey and Rose Bay. Black
Law, a son of Mr. Standfast and Hqw Sweet,
came to Melbourne from Brisbane with a high
reputation, though with successes only in two
unimportant races. O. R. Porter, who has
had extraordinary luck in a brief time as an
owner, paid a high price for the reputation, and
the colt became early favorite for the Caulfield
Cup. Some judges were not over-irfapressed by
his performance on Saturday, but he was far
from being in his best shape. Some fair gal-
lopers finished behind him.
In the second division of the St. Aubin, Night
Guardian (Hartney) was favorite and winner,
Phillip and Enthuse filling the places. The
Chatsworth Plate for three-year : olds over a
mile furnished a close finish, Revinach, Stormy
Sea and Despatch Rider coming home in that
order with little between them. Excuses were
made for Despatch Rider —possibly warranted.
* * * *
At the S.T.C. meeting at Canterbury fancied
horses bobbed up in the first two races, but
punters had a torrid time. Rubbing it in was
the fact that two of the rougher winners, Ne-
pean River (50 to 1) and Kuvera’s Double (7
to 1), are owned by a bookmaker, Mandel. He
backed them both—for how much only he
and some of his fellow-bagmen know.
One of the most painful methods of losing
money is following a fashionable jockey and
doubling up after each loss. Few of those
who follow the system could have stuck to
Mulley’s mounts after 23 consecutive losers —
that is, unless they started with a shilling or
eighteenpence. Mulley broke the drought on
Dutchman, an even-money favorite for the
second division of the Three-year-old Handicap
for colts and geldings. Dutchman is a good-
looking gelding by Brueghel from Mitebite,
and races in the same interest as Bemborough.
Together with Grand City he delayed the start,
both objecting to entering the starting boxes,
but got away well. Mulley moved him past
Superfort to take the lead nearing the distance,
and Dutchman staved off a challenge from the
fast-finishing Decorate, Grand City being third.
He looks pretty good.
The first division of the Three-year-old had
gone to the aptly-named My Hero, by Heroic’s
son Ajax from Chanson. In six previous
efforts My Hero had finished fourth, so the
superstitious may have seen an omen on
Saturday when Moore had to ride him at 41b.
overweight. Dark Marne was second, a good
way behind the winner, and Son of Persia third.
A similar event for fillies was won by Catch
On (Duncan), a daughter of Young Idea. She
came home in good style to down the grey
Gold Taj and Love Star, who may have been
unlucky. A promising run noted in this race
was that of Chanson Gai, a lightlv-raced
Matthew filly, also from the Plant stable.
His previous victories having been over
middle distances, Nepean River had support
only from the stable for the Flying. When
they settled down Nepean River was ahead of
one of the 11 runners, and had only slightly
improved his position as they turned for home.
Then the apprentice Faggotter set to work on
him and he finished too well for Felstar and
El Grandee, though the margins were narrow.
The tote made the bookmakers’ price look
silly, paying £27 16s. 9d. for ss.
In the Canterbury Handicap Buzz Off (9 to 2),
whose form has been more consistent of late,
ran a sound race to account for Cisco (9 to 2)
and Turn Again (7 to 2). Duncan had Buzz Off
close to the front all the way.
Jf( H 8 ♦ *
For his return to race-riding Darby Munro
went to Brisbane, taking the mount on Russia
in the National Plate, ten furlongs, a weight-
for-age race worth £lOOO. Knowing the peculi-
arities of Repshot and Falcon Knight, the other
two starters, Munro took Russia straight to the
front and set a brisk pace. Repshot moved up
as they turned for home, but Russia had his
measure and scooted away to win by five
lengths.

N.S.W. Governor Northcott was among
the spectators when Duntroon, which
always has a good Rugby Union side,
met a team from the Great Public
Schools. As gentlemen from the League
had to admit, it was the best and most
exciting exhibition of Rugby seen in Syd-
ney this year. Playing grandly, the
younger and lighter lads held their own
till near the end ; then quick tries gave
the Duntrooners victory by 24 points to
15. They were ably led by a Maori,
Bruce Poananga.
* * * *
Only two of the Rugby Union players
chosen for the Maoriland tour turned out
in club matches on Saturday. One,
Tweedale, helped Parramatta —showing
its best form this season —to defeat
Eastern Suburbs 19 to 3. Drummoyne
outplayed Manly 20-6, winger McCloskey
scoring three tries. Superior in the tight
stuff, West had a comfortable 21-9 vic-
tory over Gordon. Other games: Rand-
wick 44, St. George 9 ; University 14,
North 3. Randwick is leading four points
ahead of East, with Parramatta third and
Drummoyne fourth.
“P.McM.”: The Australian team for
Maoriland has speed ; whether it is rugged
enough is another matter. Centres Howell
and Mcßride have shown dash and deter-
mination in attack, without impressing
on the defensive side. Furness, the Rand-
wick hooker, might have been given a
chance, as he is better than either Hodda
or Dawson in the loose; and University
custodian Brian Piper deserves an oppor-
tunity as reserve full-back. His deft
stemming of forward rushes would make
him an asset against All Black dribbling.
He may still go—Rankin had to retire
from the Drummoyne-Manly match with
a damaged ankle.

Sydney’s Trumper Park was jammed
with the 12,000 who turned out to watch
a visiting Perth (W.A.) Aussie Rules team
clean up N.S.W. by 22.15 to 18.16.
Tucker, the Perth full-forward, aston-
ished the Sydneysiders, with his flying
marks and long kicks —he scored 14
goals from 20 shots. The team came
and went at its own expense, refusing a
share of the '‘gate.”

Floods in Riverina, drought in N. S.
Wales and Queensland, strikes, accidents,
fuel and lighting cuts, the Peace Confer-
ence, the trainless Adelaide Sunday—all
were overshadowed in Melbourne on
Saturday when the four V.F.L. leaders
were beaten, Carlton went out of
the “four” and Melbourne came
into it. Not even the reappearance
of Home Clover in a guernsey
would have been more astonish-
ing. It began at Footscray, where the
Bulldogs punched up a 4.4 lead for the
last quarter and then ran into a Mel-
bourne blizzard and were snowed under
by 16.16 to 13.13. At Richmond the
Tigers galloped joyously through the
fluttering Collingwood Magpies to the
tune of 18*9-12.15. Fitzroy flirted coyly
round the stolid Essendon rucks, picking
off goals at its ease, and collected 14.18
to 7.16. North Melbourne kicked Carl-
ton right out of the “four” by 13.9 to
10.18. Meantime, South Melbourne
morosely belted Hawthorn, 16.14-12.15,
and St. Kilda and Geelong held a work-
ing bee or something for Saints to gather
20.10 to 8.11.
It’s Essendon, Footscray, Collingwood
and Melbourne in the V.F.L. competition,
with Richmond and Carlton as rough
chances. Both have easy appointments
next Saturday and so has Melbourne.

Inclusion of Fishlock (Surrey), Edrich
(Middlesex) and James Langridge (Sus-
sex) completes the M.C.C. team for Aus-
tralia. Edrich (30) is a fine batsman and
brilliant field. He played against Aus-
tralia in 1938, but had a run of small
scores —5,0, 10, 12, 28 and 12.
Fishlock (39) has reached 2000 runs in
this season’s county matches. James
Langridge gets into representative cricket
at 40. An all-rounder with a host of
good performances, he bowls left hand,
with an excellent command of the ball.
The Englishmen are to begin their tour
against Westralia at Perth on October
11-14. Test matches are November 29-
December 5 at Brisbane, Dec. 13-19 at
Sydney, Jan. 1-7 at Melbourne, Jan 31-
Feb. 6 at Adelaide, Feb. 28-March 6 at
Sydney. The tourists will play 23
matches altogether (one less than in
1936-37). N.S.W., Victoria, S. Aus. and
Queensland are to stage a full Sheffield
Shield programme as well.

The English-Welsh Rugby League team
found N.Z. form superior to Australian,
though that isn’t saying much. On a
sodden ground at Auckland it was beaten
in the only representative match played
on the short tour, the Maorilanders scor-
ing 13 points to 8. This may mean that
a N.Z. team will go to the North of
England next year,
* * * *
Eric Cremin, the quiet little N.S.W.
pro., had a good run in Brisbane. He
won the Queensland open and the Penin-
sular Country Club’s purse, collecting
£350 in prizemoney.

Still a clever boxer and no mean actor,
Hockey Bennell was never bothered by
George Sands at Leichhardt. As aggres-
sive as any of his four fighting brothers,
Sands attacked in every round, but rarely
landed on the elusive Bennell, whose own
blows, though much lighter, were far
better aimed. When the show was getting
monotonous, Bennell revived one of the
acts in which he specialises, staggering
around the ring when a not at all power-
ful right hit him in the 11th round. He
“recovered” in time to receive the only
possible decision.
Either Johnson has gone off or is not
as good as was thought. Alf Gallagher
gave him a hiding in their second bout at
Sydney Stadium, winning the first five
rounds from end to end. Johnson did a
bit better in the sixth, but was for the
most part on the receiving end until
halfway through the 11th, when a
left body punch had him seemingly
on the verge of a knockout. He came up
fairly strong for the twelfth, but thence to
the end of the fifteenth he took more
punishment than he administered. Joe
Wallis declared it a draw. An explanation
would have been interesting, but referees
don’t have to exlpain their decisions.
A long, lean negro, Willie Jones,
brought to Australia by the mercurial
Claude Varner, is the latest threat to
Patrick. In his match at Adelaide the
black stopped Joe Grant in six rounds.
Grant was outclassed.


Is your WILL
a wise man’s
WILL?
OUPPOSE that you were asked
for your opinion of a friend’s
Will. You would require to be
satisfied upon a number of points.
Take, for example, his choice of
Executor. You would ask: Who is
he ? What is he ? What are his quali-
fications ? What experience has he ?
What is his background? Could
he be depended upon impartially
to administer the Estate in the
best interests of the beneficiaries
under all circumstances? Would
he have the time to devote to the
duties involved ? Would he always
be available? What is his age?
Is he in good health? What would
happen to the Estate if anything
happened to him?
f’erpetual Trustee Company
(Limited) satisfies all these
requirements in a way that no
individual can—what individual
could offer 60 years experience in
the management of Estates of all
kinds together with perpetual
service ?
Consider the choice of your
Executor in the same way—and
then ask yourself whether It is not
a wise man who appoints Per-
petual Trustee Company (Limited)
as his Executor—in conjunction
with a friend if he so desires.
Write for a copy of the booklet
“Your Executor and Trustee,”

Passage to Britain
Four Orient liners survived the war —
the Orion, Orontes, Otranto and Ormonde
—and the company hopes the refitted
Orion will bring its first post-war passen-
gers to Australia in November. The
other three vessels are still needed by the
British Government, and will take six
months to refit after release.
The new Orcades, of 29,000 tons, is the
first large British passenger ship to be
laid down since 1939, and is expected to
be in service late next year. It will be
two or three knots speedier than the
previous fastest Orient vessels. *
It is hoped that Orion and Orcades
will be able to make four return trips a
year, against three before the war, the
time from London to Melbourne being
cut from 36 to 28 days. But a great deal
will depend on stevedores in Australian
ports—upon how quickly the ships can be
loaded and fitted for the return voyage.
The owners are confronted with re-
duced tonnages, congested building con-
ditions and higher costs. The new
Orcades will cost 2 i times as much
as its pre-war namesake, and 40 p.c.
more space will be provided for each of
the crew, taking up an area that would
accommodate 200 extra passengers. But
by a general economy in cabin space it is
intended to carry 1300 passengers in the
refitted Orion, compared with 1030 before
the war. Making four trips a year in-
stead of three, it is hoped to transport
nearly 70 p.c, more people annually.
Orcades will take over 1500 passengers a
trip, roughly half saloon, half tourist class.
Some of Orion’s cabin space will be the
same as before the war, but a wider range
of first-class accommodation will be pro-
vided in order to meet people whose in-
comes have been reduced by heavy taxa-
tion ; for the lowest fares the saloon
cabins will be similar to pre-war tourist
class. In the dining-saloon, with more
first-class passengers to cater for, menus
will be restricted in variety; but in a
separate restaurant more individual"tastes
may be satisfied on paying a surcharge.
In the tourist section the aim is reason-
able comfort at maximum economy.
Most cabins will have hot and cold
running water.
The company anticipates a heavy de-
mand for passages during the next few
years, to be handled by fewer ships at
higher costs. It aims to make fuller use
of its ships at the most economical rates
of fares, and this principle is guiding
design in refitting and new building.
No passenger rates are yet available,
but they will certainly be higher than in
1939. How much higher should be known
within the next month or two.
i In July, 1939, just before the outbreak
of war, total employment in Australia
(rural workers, domestics and servicemen
excluded) was 1,730,000 persons. At the
end of April, 1946, the figure had risen
to 2,037,000. In the period quoted, male
employment rose from 1,293,000 to
1.427.000, and female from 437,000 to
610.000, The number of both sexes in
factories increased from 542,000 to
730.000, after having been higher in
1943-44. Considering all this “employ-
ment” our actual productive output as a
nation is a scandal, especially so far as
essential heavy and constructional indus-
tries are concerned. Coal production, or
lack of it, is the chief cause of our failure
to regain industrial momentum. Coal is
our chief source of productive and motive
power, and its output is being deliberately
curtailed by Communist forces which
desire to coerce the country into fol-
lowing their political lead. Lack of coal
is affecting steel production, most other
manufacturing activity, transport services
and the export trade. Most noticeable
consequence is the housing shortage, but
it is seen in the scarcity of a thousand
other things, even to the extent of house-
hold gas and electricity supplies, textiles,
food and ordinary travelling facilities.

We may expect to see, before very long,
the return of the professional company-
promoter and his offsider, the go-getter.
True, capital-issue restrictions forbid the
raising of more than £lO,OOO a year with-
out special Treasury consent, but £lO,OOO
cos. may yet be seen developing in pro-
moters’ offices in series, like a string of
sausages, one being more or less a repeti-
tion of the other. The lag in essential
civil production, in the availability of
essential services, will represent a handy
groundwork for the company-promoter
to build his selling story upon ; he will
be able to talk of unsatisfied production
demands very obvious to the citizen, and
possibly hold out the bait of first prefer-
ence to shareholders as soon as the pro-
posed company begins making short-
supplied goods. Many citizens, too, have
accumulated large savings during the war
years, and they may be readily parted
from some of these by representations of
the go-getter based on obvious truths as
well as on less obvious delusions. Thus
it was after World War I: there was a
rush of new flotations, intemperate young
life-assurance offices leading the field, fol-
lowed closely by an equally intemperate
swarm of “bond” issues financing
forestry, flax, tobacco, tung-oil, tropical-
fruit and rubber plantations. It was in
this era that men of the type of Woolcott
Forbes cut their dash. Not all the pro-
moters and go-getters were tarred with
the one brush by any means, and not all
had the same beginnings or the same end.
There were some “visionaries,” including
people of scientific bent, who saw rain-
bows in any kind of financial venture ;
there were others who were determined to
live well on other people’s money so long
as they could keep inside the law ; others
still who were crooked, some of them
bold as brass in their crookedness, and
getting away with it all the easier for
that. Many Australians are suckers for
the get-rich-quick story, and many more
than usual are now financially worth
cultivating by the smoothie. So far as
shares are concerned, the Federal Govern-
ment is intensifying the “sucker” situation
by virtually “freezing” the Stock Ex-
change through control of share prices.
When reputable shares are not available
rubbish becomes the more attractive.

In the first year of partial peace wool
has been rushed by world buyers. Joint
Organisation, London, reports that the
British Dominions wool surplus had been
reduced from 10 million bales to
6.334.000 bales at June 30, 1946. Many
countries, including European, have been
starved of wool for several years, while
other manufacturing countries have
seized the opportunity of buyiiig up wool
at the comparatively low prices offering.
(There has been a rise in the Australian
price since June 30.) These purchases
have been far ahead of actual con-
sumption in most of the countries
concerned. Britain and the United
States each bought over 2,000,000 bales of
Dominion wool during the 12 months to
June 30 last, and France took 1,100,000
bales. The reduction of nearly 4,000,000
bales in surplus stocks during the year
meant that that amount of wool, phis
most of the Dominions’ current clip, was
sold —a total of 8,177,000 bales altogether,
of which 5,124,000 bales was Australian.
In view of the commercial stocking-up
that has gone on in Britain and America
it is unlikely that these countries will
again buy as heavily in 1946-47, and re-
duction in the stock surplus held by Joint
Organisation on producers’ account may
not decline so rapidly; but many coun-
tries must still be short-supplied with
wool, especially the greater part of what
was occupied Europe and China and
Japan. As soon as trade with these coun-
tries can be resumed on a reciprocal
basis there should be a high consumption
of wool for several years. Stocks of
6.334.000 bales of wool held in official
hands on June 30 last comprised
4.406.000 Australian, 1,356,000 New
Zealand and 572,000 South African.

Mr. Percy Tingey, chairman of R. and
E. Tingey and Co., paint merchants, said
at the annual meeting of the co. in Wel-
lington that time would justify monetary
critics in their contentions that Bret-
ton Woods would bring deflation and
work against, particularly, America, so
upsetting world trading conditions. “We
are led to believe that the Bretton Woods
scheme is to stabilise currency, secure full
employment and provide funds for the
devastated areas,” he said. “If these are
the true objectives, N.Z. has no need to
risk its future internal economy. No
country in the world has had such a
stabilised currency. Full employment is
assured without handing over sovereignty
to Wall-street, and we have no devas-
tated areas to rebuild. Bretton Woods is
the only fly in the ointment so far as
trading conditions in N.Z. are concerned.”
He hoped Parliament would not ratify the
plan. Whatever the merits or otherwise
of Bretton Woods, Mr. Tingey seems
more confident about Maoriland’s pros-
pects under present conditions than either
Mr. Lefeaux, former Governor of the
Central Resepe Bank, or Mr. Walsh,
economic adviser to the Labor party.

The fact that the Peron Government
in Argentina has decided to charge Britain
three times as much for steers as was
asked for during the war is another clue
to the immediate trend of overseas prices.
Britain is also understood to be paying
Denmark in excess of 190 s. sterling a
hundredweight for butter, compared with
1475. 9d. sterling (184 s. Bd. Australian)
f.o.b. for choicest Australian during the
two years to June 30, 1946. An additional
13s. 4d. was added by Britain as a “grant”
on the Australian product. Now it is
announced that Dominion butter and
other dairy produce will be paid for at
a higher price during the coming year
(1735. 6d. stg. for Australian). The f.o.b.
price for best Australian butter (ex-
cluding “grants”) supplied under con-
tract to the United Kingdom was
109 s. 9d. sterling a cwt. during the period
Sept., 1939, to June, 1942; it rose to
114 s. 3d. during July, 1942, to June, 1944,
and to 1475. 9d. stg. over the next two
years. Price paid for best cheese rose
from 61s. 3d. stg. (765. 7d. Aust.) per cwt.
to 86s. stg. (107 s. 6d. Aust.) during the
period of the war. The Australian con-
sumer is charged 1665. lOd. per cwt.
wholesale for butter in N.S.W., Victoria,
Queensland and Tasmania; S.A. and
Westralian prices differ only slightly. The
producer also receives a subsidy from the
Government averaging a pound—
roughly another 425. per cwt.

Price-controls and other post-war
economic regulations will be discussed
by Federal and State Ministers later this
month. Dr. Evatt has said that the
National Security Regulations will expire
on Dec. 31, but it is proposed to con-
tinue certain controls by special legisla-
tion. Some of these controls, such as
those over prices and rents, will require
State approval, and in this respect there
has been some difficulty in the Tasmanian
Legislative Council. Mr. A. E. Heath,
president of Sydney Chamber of Com-
merce, insists that there should be a right of
appeal from decisions by the Prices Com-
missioner, no such right having been in
existence since the regulations were intro-
duced. He also asks for a simplification
of procedure and a more helpful attitude
towards industry’s obvious prpblems.
It is believed that the Federal Treasury
will insist on controlling new capital
issues for an indefinite period. It has
already replaced its war-time controls
over the banking system by peace-time
legislation even more socialistic, the
Commonwealth Bank board having been
swept away.

Aspects of the Dollar Loan
The sharp outburst of criticism, from
both sides of the Atlantic, of the U.S.
loan to Britain could scarcely have been
keener had a state of economic warfare
been declared. It arose out of a common
desire for economic security and expan-
sion. Everywhere the emphasis is on em-
ployment—something that can be over-
emphasised, Measures to promote
employment will certainly assist trade, but
soundly based measures to promote trade
will lead to permanent employment. This
more desirable end can best be achieved
at the moment by each country stepping
up production and keeping purchasing
power in its home markets in a stable con-
dition. It is against this background that
the loan and the conditions attaching to
it should be considered.
The purposes of the loan are “to
facilitate purchase by the U.K. of
goods and services in the U.S., to
assist the U.K. to meet transi-
tional deficits in its current balance of
payments, to help the U.K. to maintain
adequate reserves of gold and dollars, and
to assist the U.K. to assume obligations
of multilateral trade as defined in this
and other agreements.” In its simplest
form the British problem is one of finding
a way to pay for a volume of imports
large enough to sustain speedy reconver-
sion at a time when foreign receipts are
inadequate, and thus avoid a steep fall in
the British standard of living.
Before 1914 about 40 p.c. of British
production was for export, whereas it is
estimated that less than 20 p.c. was Tor
this purpose in 1938. Also, owing to
Britain’s diminished stature as a creditor
nation, London links together a lesser
proportion of the credit and clearing
arrangements of international trade than
it used to.
With World War I came the inevitable
and now familiar diversion of resources,
followed, when war ended, by the in-
escapable problems of demobilisation and
rehabilitation. Policies of industrial self-
sufficiency in overseas countries added to
exporting difficulties. Then, under the
strain of world depression at the end of
the 1920’5, British economic policy under-
went a revolution, outward and visible
signs of which were suspension of the
gold standard and final abandonment of
Free Trade —employment and security
began to oust cheapness and enterprise
as the prime aim of economic policy.
The resultant - exchange pressures led to
introduction of British controls and
Empire preferences. Other countries
whose trade was closely linked with that
of Britain joined the fold, which became
known as the “sterling group.”
With the advent of World War II all
the old problems reappeared on a much
larger, wider and more intensified scale.
The dollar pool, sales of dollar invest-
ments and lend-lease looked after im-
ports of U.S. goods; as to payments
within the sterling area (largely for main-
tenance of British forces), “blocked ster-
ling” balances arose.
The dollar loan agreement now recog-
nises the special reconversion difficulties
with which Britain is faced. In addition
to the heavy cost of rehabilitating war-
damaged industries, abnormal expendi-
ture has to be met on establishments in
occupied countries and elsewhere, and on
social services at home. An estimate in
the White Paper which accompanied the
loan agreement put the deficit in Britain’s
balance of payments over the next five
years at about five thousand million dol-
lars. So the loan, substantial as it is,
will leave a considerable deficit to be met
from other sources.
In return for the loan Britain has
agreed, within a year, to relax war-time
exchange controls. Among other things,
this means (1) cessation of any further
blocking of sterling, (2) loss of an im-
portant source of dollars, namely, the
dollar pool, and (3) that all countries
within the sterling group will have their
current exchange receipts free for use
anywhere in the world. As for the
blocked sterling balances, Britain has
agreed to seek arrangements for “an
early settlement” on the basis of a partial
write-off, and liquidation of the balance
by instalments —first or immediate re-
lease to be convertible into any currency
for current transactions ; subsequent and
similar payments to begin in 1951.
But time has not stood still. Recent de-
velopments in India and Egypt make
prospects of any scaling-down of the
large sterling balances held by these
countries improbable, to say the least.
The aggregate of sterling balances
originally involved was about £3500 mil-
lion, not all of which has been accumu-
lated on a basis comparable with
lend-lease transactions. There promise to
be many thorny and complicated prob-
lems that will require delicate and dex-
terous handling when the British Treasury
embarks on its negotiations with holders
of sterling balances. The proportion of
these that become immediately convert-
ible into dollars will, besides making
more dollar exchange available to
holders, reduce the effective amount of
the loan available to Britain, which in
turn will make the overall 2 p.c. rate of
interest a nominal figure.
Then there is-the disturbing possibility
that the loan itself might be exhausted
before British rehabilitation is complete,
while the conditions attached to it con-
tinue to have effect. These cqnditions
subject British monetary policy to the
requirements of immediate convertibility,
which means a prompter balancing of
import payments than was necessary
when sterling was less readily convert-
ible, The extent to which members of
the sterling group elect to hold balances
in currencies other than sterling will
aggravate the very problem the loan is
intended to solve —Britain’s exchange
shortage. It is possible that after 1951
Britain might have to become increasingly
dependent upon the International Mone-
tary Fund for some of the burdens con-
nected with the defence of sterling. For
Australia and other Empire countries
chief danger lies in the possibility of
world trade failing to revive sufficiently
to enable Britain to maintain imports on
at least the pre-war scale, with inevitable
repercussions on prices for primary pro-
ducts.
Revelation of whatever meaning the
“general rule of non-discrimination”
might have ultimately for Empire prefer-
ence and changes in the U.S. tariff will
have to await fuller formulation of trade
policy by the proposed International
Trade Organisation or by other arrange-
ment. The Dominions would need to be
assured that the U.S. and other countries
would be prepared to' buy their goods be-
fore they agreed to any arrangement that
would reduce their chances of selling
them in Britain. The dependence of Em-
pire producers upon Empire markets is
not removed by elimination of bilateral
agreements. No many-sided trade ad-
vantage, however impressive, could com-
pensate Empire countries for anything
which might compromise inter-imperial
relations.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Old-timer”: Old Sandy Hilton was
the most unshakable bloke I ever met
on the track. One night we came into
Warracknabeal from the Dimboola side
and found an empty two-roomed shack
on the bank of the creek downstream
from the bridge. There we made camp,
ate a meal and, to the continuous roar
of heavy rain on the iron roof, got into
our bunks. Two or three times I awoke
to hear the rain still pouring down and
sometime after midnight, recalling the
location of that hut, I became concerned
and woke Sandy. “Do y’ reckon we’re
safe here; what if the creek comes down?”
I said. “Doan’ be silly, it won’t rise that
high!” Sandy grunted, and turned over
in his nap. Towards dawn I awoke again,
put my hand out and felt water, cold
and wet, on the floor. I shot upright and
there, perched on an old box, with a stub
of candle alight on the window-ledge be-
hind him, was Sandy, peering at a scrap
of newspaper. He looked up at my move-
ment and said, casually, “Ha, y’re awake.
Well, don’t get excited. It says here that
only calm to moderate seas is expected.”

“Blime”: Came on Bill digging out a
wombat burrow, and swung over for a
smoke. “This bloke’s been givin’ me a
good run for it lately,” Bill remarked,
nodding at the hole. “Ain’t hadf no luck
with traps, but I’m on to him this time.
Too right he’s home —hear him?” 1
turned an ear, then chuckled as I realised
the wombat was digging ahead of the old
chap. “What’s funny about it?” he
grunted. “I’m gettin’ the cow if I got t’
stop all night.” Considering the depth
and the sandy soil, I decided there- was
a big chance of that, as for the next 20
minutes I watched Bill shovel away the
earth the wombat scratched back to
him. Returning that evening, I said “Did
you catch up?” “One of us did,” Bill
drawled. “I dug on for another half hour
or more before 1 woke up that I wasn t
gettin’ nowhere, so I took a careful line
on his direction and went well out in
front. Shovelled out a good deep hole,
then sat down t’ wait.” Bill stopped to
grin at the memory, “Yair,” he nodded,
“he caught up.”

“Junius Jr.”: In an article in “John o’
London,” by Dr. Flugel, professor of
psychology at University College, Lon-
don, I read that “The continuance of a
grotesque element in man’s conception of
the supernatural is to be found at all
levels of culture, from that of the Aus-
tralian bushman upwards.” Can it be
that the learned doctor, by a mistaken
analogy with the African bushman, thinks
that the Australian bushman is an abo.?
Or are “Mat’s Mate” and his tribe really
the lowest form of culture known to
psychologists?

“Mat’s Mate”: We’d hardly hit the
town when a cove gave us a job digging
along the main street for about 100 yards
a trench in which he’d contracted to lay
pipes for the council. Mat and I
slugged away with pick and shovel,
knocked off at 12 for lunch and started
again at 1 p.m. We had an audience
then, about a dozen blokes from the
shops, banks and offices gathering along
the street to watch us, as is the immem-
orial way when men start digging in
public places. I could see Mat didn’t like
it and he might have broken out only that
2 p.m. came and the watchers went back
to work. But the next day was Wednes-
day, a half-holiday in that town, and we
had a crowd watching us off and on all
the afternoon. Mat was sullen and quiet
that night, and next morning he asked the
boss if we could have an hour or two
off in the afternoon. “What for?” the
boss asked. Mat told him. “All right,”
he said. At 2.5 p.m. we dropped our tools
and went into the store, whoje we stood
by the counter and closely watched all
that went on. About 2.30 p.m. the store-
manager came and asked us what we
wanted, “Nothing,” roared Mat. “Not a
ruddy thing more than these silly cows
of yours want watchin’ us work. We’re
just gettin’ our own back, that’s all, an’
I’d like t’ know what you reckon you
can do about it.” The manager backed
off, biting his lips and plainly worried.
But there was nothing he could do. By the
time we’d worked it in the two banks and
the agent’s office we were allowed to dig
our trench in peace.

“Fang”: We were sitting on a sand-
bar when the flattie hove around a bend
and Bill, grinning from ear to ear,
rowed over. “Just seen the funniest
thing,” he confided. “Me an’ ol’ Peter

’bout a mile upstream. We’re anchored
near a big, steepsided bluff of rock, an’

Peter now?” Andy asked. Bill stared
goggle-eyed at the vacant seat. “Gripes,

said.

“The 0.D.”: That method of finding
bee-trees by catching a bee and tying a
small balloon to it (B. 31/7/’46) was all
very well in pre-war days when you could
get balloons. But when the rubber short-
age came on the game was hopeless,
though a few blokes out our way tried
blowing up small paper-bags. This
worked only when the bee had a short
distance to go ; anything over a mile saw
the wind slowly escape from the paper,
and then prevailing winds simply acted
on the thing as on a sail and many a bee
was blown clean over the border. How-
ever, young Dooley McCorth came to
light with the usual example of Australian
initiative. An early discharge from the
anti-aircraft battery which he joined early
in the piece, Dooley scrounged the parts of
a listening device and brought them home.
With this mounted on an ancient car he
was able to trace a bee’s flight by its
sound, but that led to further trouble
since many of the bees were domesticated
and Dooley kept getting led to private
hives. Then he got a really good idea.
Whenever he captured a wild bee he put
a fish-tailed nick in its port wing and was
thus able to trail them by the high, inter-
mittent note of their flight. He’s now
wonting on an adaptation of the radar
principle.

“B, A. Ker”; Unnatural and over-
matemal mothers are to be found among
birds as well as animals (B. 17/7/’46).
Once misjudged a green budgerigah be-
cause I saw her emerge, smeared with
blood, from the nest-box <of a yellow
hen. Investigation showed that one chick
was dead and the other three badly
butchered. When next morning I found
the survivors with their crops empty the
light dawned. The minute the green hen
was released from her solitary confine-
ment she was back in the nest-box doing
the job her murderous cousin had re-
jected. I’ve known canaries to pluck the
down from their own young in order
to reline the nest for the next clutch;
and I’ve seen other hens mother the
neglected babies. A bird-fancier of
Fairfield (N.S.W.) has a photograph
which certainly appears to support his
claim that a hen canary used to feed a
goldfish in the aquarium inside his aviary.
Yet the scientific explanation of all this
peculiar maternal behavior is quite
simple. Maternal instinct in bird or ani-
mal is dependent on prolactin, a secretion
from the pituitary gland at the base of the
brain. A deficiency of prolactin and the
un atural mother is made ; an abundance
produces the good mother. Scientists
have proved that prolactin injected into
a rooster will cause the intensely mascu-
line creature to lower his dignity to the ex-
tent of mothering chicks. What’s more,
he will do the job clucking without shame.
* * * *
“Goldie”: As a battler the dinkum
prospector stands out on his own. One
I struck in Victoria’s mountain country
recently has an alluvial show miles back
on his own, and visits civilisation every
month or so. No hatter, he is working
systematically to dig a water-race eight
miles long, a job that will take at least
two years. His prospects, with the water
there for sluicing, are good enough to
hope for a generous reward. I’ve known
others do almost as much for practically
nothing.

“Lower Tops’l”: Tell “Sou’-west” (B.
10/7 / ’46) that rats at Mallacoota (Vic.)
gnaw holes in nets all right, though fisher-
men there never thought of attributing
it to the flavor of jelly-fish slime. Per-
haps, too, it is this appetiser, and not the
salt as is thought, that induces the town-
ship’s cows and calves at every oppor-
tunity to eat drying nets. Incidentally, in
bygone days, old-timers there tell me,
bloodwood-gum was used to tan nets
against the slime. They claimed it put a
galvanised finish on nets, and thereby
seines did not so readily absorb water.
But you know what fishermen are. Ask-
ing others there why they didn’t use the
red-gum nowadays, they averred it simply
rotted nets.

“B. 4”: A river is the best medium for
conducting sound, which is concentrated
between the banks and reflected along
the surface. A deep mountain valley will
conduct sounds elsewhere inaudible at
similar distances; on open plains sound
is rapidly dissipated irrespective of pitch
or volume. Of course, sound travels
farther by night. For animal transmis-
sion my votes go to a scrub bull bellow-
ing in top register and to a warrigal
howling in a mountain gully on a frosty
night.

“Horseless Horseman”: “M.U.R.’s”
mention of Medley’s pub at Euston (B.
24/7/’46) recalls that the quaint steep-
gabled structure, constructed of locally-
made bricks, is the oldest hostelry on the
Murray; in another five years it will
celebrate its centenary. What stories it
could tell of explorers, old pioneers and
bygone bushmen! In 1852 it saw Captain
Cadell on his exploratory boat trip down
river, and a year later it feted him on his
arrival there in the first Murray steamer,
the Lady Augusta. It was standing when
the Burke and Wills expedition pushed
north from near-by Lake Benanee, and
when the local squatter John McKinlay
led an expedition in search of the ill-
fated explorers. In latter decades it has
watched the adjacent Euston station grow
until it became headquarters for an area
as large as a European kingdom with its
own wool-scour and boiling-down works,
and employing a fleet of river steamers
and teams. This century it has silently wit-
nessed the passing of the old station days
and ways. Nowadays a bushman knock-
ing down a cheque, rivermen “coming
ashore” for a beer or a horse being
ridden into the bar is a rarity. How-
ever, I do remember an occasion when a
sozzled pastoralist got up on the roof,
breaking bricks off the top of the kitchen
chimney and dropping them down it on
to the kitchen stove, “just to hear the
splash! ”

“Herbert Dawson”: Tell “G.F.8.” (B.
10/7/’46) that the reason he didn’t see
any dogs in the film version of “The
Virginian” is that the cowhands of the
American ranches don’t use dogs in
rounding-up “dogies” and “steers.” At
least, I have always understood so, and
I cannot think of one of the thousands
of American cow-country novels in which
Bluey gets mention in that connection.
Further, when the American rodeo team
that visited Australia a few years back
made the acquaintance of the Queens-
land heeler they fell over themselves to
get pups to take home with them.

“Hanko”: Like “Lower Tops’!” (B.
24/7/’46), I’ve caught quail per foot,
but they weren’t Californian browns. The
birds I hounded to a standstill were weak-
flighted chooks, somewhat smaller than
a stubble quail and plumaged in buff
shot with brown. They were known in
that part of Victoria’s south-central dis-
trict as butterfly quail, and were spumed
by old-timers because of their uselessness
as toast-decorators. When harried by a
determined and long-winded sprinter
these birds took ever-shortening flights,
till finally they lay spent and helpless. I
suspect that the speckled fliers got the
stitch ; I know I did.

“Dinkum”: Contrary to “Notaden’s”
claim (B. 17/7/’46) that the white-eyed
raven is the lamb-killer is the more
general acceptance that the menace is the
red-eyed bird —where “Notaden” gets his
hazel-eyed specimen is a puzzler. Having
caught many of the pests over the past
months and kept check, I discovered the
following points; firstly, both white- and
red-eyed birds hunt together in the same
small mobs ; secondly, both are carcass-
eaters. Am also of the opinion that both
are killers, for the claim that the insecti-
vorous clan are merely hunting blowfly
larvae can be ruled out when they are
caught picking into newly-born and fresh-
killed lambs on mid-winter mornings. To
which variety the egg-eating nuisance be-
longed beat me till I shot first one
then the other of a particularly
troublesome pair in the act of egg-
lifting. Both had red eyes. This,
however, is no proof that I shall not some
day collect a white-eyed egg-pincher. The
family have become mixed and I no longer
contest old Charlie’s claim that “white,
red or brindle, all the perishin’ cows want
a bash on the nut.”

“C.E.”: When old man Walters de-
parted “over the range,” he left his place
to a city nephew, and soon young Harry'
received a letter from “Humping
Charlie, advising him not to leave the
place long unattended. A bit later Harry
arrived, and under Charlie’s guidance
started in to learn the sheep business.
Daily he rode the fences, kept an eye on
the stock and noted their brands, but
what annoyed him was a bunch of his
neighbor Sweeney’s ewes that persistently
wandered his river frontage trying to get
through into the clover. Returning one
afternoon, Harry found the strays had
broken the fence and become boxed with
his own ; so, putting the dog around the
mob, he began hand-picking them. Pre-
sently he stopped and examined a ewe
more carefully; then he inspected the
others, shook his head, called his dog ano
drove the unwanted mob several miles
upstream. In the morning he sought
Charlie. “It isn’t my place to criticise,
he admitted, “but, you know, in some
ways my uncle was a bit too easygoing
Take his stock. Everybody runs the same
sort of sheep around here, and of course
their brands are different; still, y° u

DAWSON’S DAUGHTERS.
Oombabeer was a run forbidden
To men fainthearted who pulled the reins,
Its pastured spaces were scarred and hidden
By grisly scrub-belts that mazed the plains;
And out in the front of the constant battle,
Besting the best men stride for stride,
The Dawson girls they lorded the cattle,
Riding the Dawson riverside.
Dawson’s daughters could ride like thunder,
Could whed a mob in its fastest flight;
With the moon above and the blue grass under
The fiercest rush was their hearts’ delight;
They would cleave the clumps of the scrub and
sandal
At racing pace like a hurtling spear,
And never a colt too rough to handle,
Never a piker earned their fear.
Danger’s mates on the runs of madness,
Light and true were their bridle hands;
Risk of life was their joy and gladness.
They had no peer in the cattlelands.
Beauty lived in their raven tresses,
Such that the coldest heart might stir;
Brown their cheeks from the wind’s caresses,
Queens were they of the rein and spur.
Men still ride in the silver morning
Where wild-eyed mobs by the scrub-lines
graze,
Fear forgetting and terror scorning,
Lords of the blue Australian days.
Here on the sheds of her tawny waters
The long brown river has bred the best,
But never the peer of Dawson’s daughters
Has graced a saddle from east to west.
QUEENSLAND.

“Zake”: When Mrs. Patterson, who
ran a small dairy-farm, had been a widow
for about four months it became obvious
to the district that she was about to go
into circulation again. There were two
contenders for the farm, which would go
with her horny hand —Steve Bottrell, a
large, handsome man of about 40, and
Dan Rappcott, a short, dehydrated fellow
with a face not unlike a rat’s, and much
the same age as Steve. The knowalls
knew there was only one in it —until
Mrs. P. lugged Dan to the altar. It was
to the surprised wife of the minister that
Mrs, Patterson confided the reason for
her choice. “Yer see, Mrs. Porter,” she
said, “Me late ’usband was about middle
size, as y’ll prob’ly remember. Well, 1

I couldn’t stretch ’em to make ’em fit

“Colonel Bungstarter”: Begging “Ex-
med’s” pardon, there has * been a
recorded instance of a man committing
a completely successful suicide by strang-
ling himself with his own hand (B.
24/7/’46). It occurred in New York some
30 years ago and attracted considerable
press attention at the time. The pro-
cedure was simple, and completely effec-
tive. Lying on the floor, the operator
placed his right hand in correct position
for shutting off his windpipe and squeezed
it tightly in place with the left one. An
hour later he was found well and truly
dead of suffocation. P.S. —Reading this
over I find that I have omitted to mention
that his right hand was an artificial metal
one which be had fixed up to remain shut
when closed down. But it was his own,
all the same.

“Nagheer”: Even after its demise per
the trigger-finger of a milkman, the
Yengarie (Q.) dingo-Alsatian “lion”
continues to give trouble. Its skin,
bought by a publican for display at his
hostelry, has disappeared unaccountably.
Anyhow, it was a far less ornately-clad
animal than was the Potina (N.Q.) “tiger”
of thirty-odd years ago, whose fierce roars
and striped coat terrified the countryside
for days. Headed by the young local
bobby, now a Chief Police Inspector, a
heavily-armed party set out to tackle the
monster. Sighting it at last, but beyond
certain range, the hunters took cover and
closed cautiously in upon the striped
terror. It fell to the bobby’s first shot —■
and turned out to be a well-grown calf
which some joker had draped in several
old striped football guernseys fixed in
place where necessary with flypaper.

“Potrero”: Tin wax match-boxes
served also as “message cards” (B.
24/7/’46) in the days not so long ago in
the Gulf country when a man wasn’t
dressed unless he wore a match-box pouch
on his belt. Then, the perforated striker
used to be on the side of the box, and
underneath —as a guard against borrowers
—a man always scratched his name,
station and the date. Arriving at any old
camp on the stockroutes, everyone first
of all walked around examining the empty
tins, discovering by the scratches thereon,
that “Bill Smith was here last July,” or
that “Paddy the Fenian is back on
Canobie.”

“Bo”; The old utility, doing around 25
on the red road about a mile out of
Billygunyah, came around the bend by
Thompson’s, where a big rocky outcrop
obscured the view. The road immediately
deteriorated into a series of deep pot-
holes and strewn boulders, with a hair-
pin bend another ten yards beyond. The
driver jammed both feet forward and,
hoping for the best, swung the wheel.
The car swerved sickeningly, took a
drunken post in its stride and finished up
in the 3ft. gutter at the roadside with a
smashed front wheel. As the driver
crawled out and surveyed the damage
Thompson came by with a hoe over his
shoulder. The driver stopped cursing to
express a wonder why the soanso the
silly blankards didn’t have a notice up
to warn the unwary coming down the hill
of the worst stretch of road in the State.
“We ’ad one up,” volunteered Thompson,
“but we took it down ’bout six munce
ago.” “What the hell for?” asked the
motorist. “Well, that was jist after Jeff
Flood broke ’is two laigs when ’is bike
got outa control at the hairpin there—
we thought everyone’d ’ear about it —so
what was the use o’ keepin’ the notice
up?”
“ Nylons — oh, boy !”
“G’roper”; What gave “Dicky Beach”
(B. 10/7/’46) the idea that here in the
west we call his “tailer” fish the skip-
jack? The W.A. skipjack is the eastern
trevally. The tailer, of both eastern and
western seaboards, derives its name from
its practice of tailing after a chosen school
of prey and darting in, snapping them
tail first —a practice which frequently
leads to the tailer’s own downfall. Long
ago a wily Oriental fastened a fair-<sized
hook to the end of a long line, baiting
the hook with a tiny tuft of white
feathers tied on about an inch above the
eye. Trailed some 20 yards behind a
sampan this contraption viewed from
undersea gives the illusion of a small fish
swimming on the surface. So, following
his bent, the voracious tailer flies up and
snap's at what it takes to be the tail of
the little white fish. Anything better in
the way of sport than pulling in such big
sea tailer has yet to be discovered,

“Old Camp”: There is a grimmer bush
yarn than the one of the tree-trapped
horseman, and it actually happened—near
Kanowna (W.A.) in 1899. The report may
be read in that year’s files of the Kal-
goorlie “Miner.” A newchum made camp
near a lofty tree. Early one morning it
fell, pinning him. Soon dry twigs and
leaves caught alight from the embers of
his campfire, and so, utterly helpless, he
watched the fire creep towards him. In
the end, with nobody around for miles,
he was slowly roasted to death.

“S’pose y’d get a few here occasionally,”
he remarked. “Ever do any trappin’, old-
timer?” “Seventyfiver” came back to
earth. “Just a bit,” was his nonchalant
reply. “Got to trap the Pinchgut belt some-
times.” “Catch your fingers?” Andrews
grinned politely. “Not quite,” returned the
old bloke, “though I admit she was awk-
ward at first, settin’ on them steep, rocky

came the gasp. “What was the matter

“X.E.D.”: Coady, big, fat and lazy,

other tradesmen of the township. His
loafing, debts and ability to exist on the
barest necessities were oft-discussed
topics, and his little scrub selection
languished for want of attention. Came
a time, however, when Coady marched
into the store full of importance and
leaned nonchalantly against the counter.
“Got any terbaccer,. Fred?” he bawled.
“Well, er” began Fred. “Aw, it don’t

“they’d pay a bob a squint at that phiz-
ful of moth-eaten whiskers and wrinkles.”

“R.E.”: Old Joe Wheatear had recently
sold his team and bought a tractor. On
sale day when I met him his right hand
was heavily bandaged. I asked what had
happened. “Oh, it’s that tractor,”
said Joe. “I was ploughing yestidday and
the hook came undone on the draught-
bar. When I climbed down to fix it up
I forgot for a moment, and thinking that
I still had the team, called ‘Steady there.

exhaust pipe.”

“Gravelsnatcher”: I can sympathise
with “Horseless Horseman” with his table-
tapping ants (B. 17/7/’46), having once
spent an almost sleepless week listening
each night to a loud tapping sound which
baffled me. Commencing when my head
hit the pillow, it continued throughout
the night, pausing only when I arose in
my wrath to search for it. I was develop-
ing a complex of some sort and credit-
ing the creator of the sleep-destroying
noise with devilish omniscience when,
pausing in the operation of stripping the
bark from a jarrah sapling one day, I
heard an identical noise. I traced this
one to its source—easily, because the
borer that was making it was visible,
stripped of its protection. That evening
the jarrah posts of my bush bed were
stripped, and the offending borer re-
moved. A little over an inch long, it
was hard to believe it capable of making
•so much noise; but it would eat its way
into the hard jarrah, an operation which
would scarcely be noiseless.

“Timothy Tywire”: Force of habit
sustains my interest in some of the wild
life of the bush now that I’m temporarily

back, putting on my boots involves the
preliminary up-turning of each in turn to
dislodge any possible night-wandering
scorpion or centipede.

“B. 4”: Now that considerable crossing
has occurred between dingoes and dogs,
has any scalper examined the teeth? The
insignia of the true warrigal are four sets
of molars, whilst Towser sports only
three. Examining several dingoes of
dubious ancestry, I found that though
they inherited certain characteristics of
the dingo, viz., pricked ears, cocked tail,
good timber, white weskits, etc., they were
short on the dental quota. Again, your
true warrigal remains silent under terrible
punishment with fang or waddy. Gut-
shot a dingo slut once with a dum-dum,
and she merely spun round dragging out
her intestines until, finally, biting free, she
trotted away for 100 yards before another
bullet pulled her up. At the head of
the Burdekin, while packing camp, I
dropped a prowling dingo with a .22, and
half an hour later drove over to scalp
him. By then he was quarter of a mile
distant, working along on his front paws.
The bullet had broken his coupling and
paralysed his spine. He neither roared
nor howled as X used the swinglebar on
him. That fellow had the full distinctive
issue which differentiates dingo from dog.
“Colonel Bungstarter”: “You can talk
about your sheepdogs,” as W. T. Goodge’s
Man from Allan’s Creek put it long ago,
or your Great Danes, Pekes, blue heelers,
racing greyhounds, or whatever else in
the canine line your fancy runs to, but
the only really fine gentleman in the
whole dog world is a bull terrier. Of his
ancestral stock, the fox terrier paternal
side—a foxie mother is too likely to, die
in pupping on account of the broad head
of a bulldog cross —is too temperamental
to ever acquire that splendid calm which
marks the caste of Vere de Vere. Bull-
dogs are all that can be desired except
for their overdeveloped sense of duty,
which may lead them into such errors of
judgment as tearing the udder off a cow
intruding into the garden or choking
a Newfoundland because of a fancied
growl at a beloved master. The faults
of each side are cancelled out in the cross.
* * * *
“Naturala”: When aboriginal types
were to be found in many parts of the
globe, dogs were classified by Cuvier into
three main groups: matins, spaniels and
dogues. No. 1 of the matin group
is the dingo, the dog of New Holland,
held to be the most ancient canine type
extant, and possibly the earliest kind of
true dog. Derived from the same ancestor
were the French matin, the Great Dane,
all types of greyhound and the Albanian
dog. The second group, spaniels, needs
no comment, Dogues include the bull-
dog, the pug, the mastiff, all dogs with
that peculiar foreshortened type of head.
Further back than these divisions all
dog types derived from the one ancestor,
which is thought to have been not very
different from the dingo. In their internal
structure and organs wolf, dog, fox and
jackal are the same.

“Lub”: Jack, tall, big-framed and with
a drooping handlebar moustache, lived
by the deserted sawmill in a rickety shack
which was surrounded by a collection of
junk, ranging from discarded jam-tins to
broken-down harvesters. “You think
some of the stuff may come in useful
some time or other?” I asked him one
day, “No, I s’pose not,” Jack answered
slowly. “But y’ don’t keep things on’y
for use. Now just take this busted
separator, for instance. I ’member Joe
an’ Kate Regan startin’ out on their
scrub selection with this same separator
t’ do f’r half a dozen scrawny cows; an’
now their flash grandson makes a pile
on that property an’ scoots round the
districk in one of them big motor-cars
with glass winders. An’ that old fence-
strainer ; Brady an’ his cousin had a fight
lastin’ two hours over the cousin lendin’
it t’ the father of a girl who turned Brady
down. An’ that stack of jam- an’ fruit-
tins is a pretty fair guide t’ how Simpson
an’ his mob of kids are doin’ with the
rabbit-trappin’ this season. Yair, this
bit of stuff has a hist’ry wot’d fill a dozen
books. Not that I figger takin’ on writin’,
mind y’, but it sort’ve keeps an old bloke
like me in touch with things havin’ this
museum handy. And by cripes,” he
added with warmth, “there’ll be nothin’
like that t’ sling orf at me about when I
kick the bucket —I alw’ys make a point of
buryin’ anythin’ I break or wear out.”
THE TI-TREE IS FLOWERING
AGAIN.
No late frost, powdered and dusted
Right down to ocean’s edge,
On branches rimmed and rusted
With winter’s bitter siege;
No snowfall out of season
Aslant those burdened spars:
Far other is the reason
Of earth’s uncounted stars.
It is the spring, adorning
The ti-tree, frond and spray,
That winds its scarf this morning
About Port Phillip Bay.
Below, the waves’ hushed measure,
The heart-beat of the tide;
Above, this untarnished treasure
And nothing else beside,
But pale clematis tangles,
The cape-weed’s yellow floor,
And banksias at all angles
Bent backward from the shore.
VICTORIA.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
“DON'T WORRY I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS.”
Plain-bodied Sheep.
“Hux”: Since 1900 there’s been a trend
towards plain bodies and no decrease
in the wool yield has been noticeable.
The demand in N.S.W. and Queensland
for plain-breeched rams is increasing.
Arguments in their favor are their robust
health, even fleeces and increased per-
centages in lambs.
Fly strike is not a matter of chance nor
is it due to the health of the sheep, says
H. G. Belschner, D.V.Sc. Predisposi-
tion is inherent; research has proved
wrinkliness the main cause. Crutch strike
is most common in wrinkled breeches ;
sheep with plain breeches are usually
clean. Body strike can be traced to
faulty structure of the withers and wool
liable to fleece rot.
There is the Mules operation, of course,
and there is the Manchester treatment,
both good, but neither stops the advent
of wrinkly progeny. Elimination of
wrinkles can only be brought about by
culling and careful mating. If ewes with
breech wrinkles, bad wither conforma-
tion and yellow or harsh wools are cut
out, general standard of the flock is
raised and fly strike reduced. Use of
plain-breech, progeny-tested rams has re-
sulted in improvement in constitution and
quality of wool.
Dairy Hygiene.
“Rooster”: Don’t know where
“C.A.S.” (B. 10/7/’46) resides, but on
this Gippsland mixed farm,
barely 40 miles from Mel-
bourne, it’s 15 months since
an inspector, “dictatorial”
or otherwise, has been
seen. As usual, it was
a hurried and cursory in-
spection. Mostly he took
my word for it that quite ordinary
hygiene routine was followed. I maintain
that milking should be done cleanly.
Labor shortage is a headache for the
dairyfarmer, but even so work can be
made less like chores and time can be
saved by a sensible interest and a labor-
saving system. Both employer and em-
ployee soon become sick of haphazard
methods. The trouble is that most
farmers won’t face up to their labor prob-
lems squarely. I’ve roughed it at differ-
ent times on dairyfarms under condi-
tions that even a pig wouldn’t relish, but
still it didn’t prevent me from doing the
job properly.
It’s axiomatic these days that food
production should have first priority. But
it’s also essential that dairy produce
should be disease-free. If “C.A.S.” can
tell me that stripping the dirt from teats
into milk-buckets and then running the
milk through separators is a “nicety”
that entails extra “chores,” then I’ll say
there’s no need for inspectors at all. But
that’s only one of the practices still
prevalent among dairy cockies. Perhaps
it’s because they lack interest.
We need those inspectors. Rigid con-
trol and subsidies for small dairyfarmers
to enable them to purchase modern equip-
ment would, in time, stimulate a renewed
interest in a job that is now considered
the last word in drudgery, but there’s no
excuse for slovenliness. What is worth
doing is worth doing well, and doing it
well pays.
Training the Cow.
“Atlanta”: Heifers should be trained
to good habits in the yard and milking-
shed from their first calf. Patience and
careful handling will produce a cow
which is seldom upset or excited, will
walk into the milking-shed and bail-up of
her own free will, requires no leg-roping,
and will let down her milk quickly and
completely after washing and not before.
In the United States it has been proved
—particularly where machines are used
—that it is most important that udder and
teats should not be washed more than a
minute before milking begins. Cows with
udders washed 20 minutes before milk-
ing have shown production decreases of
20 p.c. within a fortnight, while under
normal conditions on most farms pro-
duction declines at the rate of four to
five per cent, per fortnight.
By simulating the warm, wet, massag-
“I'll still lay y a quid to ten bob'Barney!"
ing action of the sucking calf, in the
process of washing and later of machine
milking, it is possible to train cows to
let milk down thoroughly in about
minutes. H. J. Geddes, Garland Lec-
turer in Animal Husbandry, Sydney Uni-
versity, emphasises also the extreme im-
portance of removing machines from
cows quickly, as leaving them on after
the flow has ceased will damage teats
and may cause mastitis. Bearing down
on the claws at the end of that time
would remove the last drop and eliminate
stripping
Soil and Its Maintenance.
“F.W.L.”: When rock disintegrates in
the course of time there are liberated the
elements of soil, but the course to ulti-
mate fertility is a long and devious one
that follows in the passing of centuries.
Lump together the constituents of rock,
the clays and silica sands and a multi-
tude of minerals, and you have the
potential though inactive source of soiL
Expose to the close association of water
and air and activity begins, continuing
as long as the elements are in contact.
The soil from its earliest beginning is a
living creation.
The first stage in soil formation is en-
tirely chemical. The numerous minerals
oxidise, corrode in various chemical
changes and disperse in combination
through the stable silica and clay par-
ticles. Insularity may prevail in certain
districts where the shedding rocks are
short of important minerals, though the
more vital ones are generally present to
some degree. More widely, the geologic
ages and characteristics of rocks have a
definite bearing on the mineral com-
ponents of the soil. National soil pov-
erty may be expressed in shortage of an
element such as phosphorus, manganese
or iron.
Now there is formed a soil that is in-
organic and will not grow plants. Primi-
tive vegetation, originating in marine
growth, began Nature’s slow process of
incorporating organic matter in the soil.
There followed through countless years
the evolution of plant life on the decay
of its ancestors, plant upon plant until
the era of the forest and animate life as
we know it developed.
The story of the forests is a simple one.
The trees maintained and built a rich
organic layer of soil on the forest floor,
while their roots reached deep in the sub-
soil, breaking it up into their own or-
ganic form to shed slowly on the surface.
There was erosion of the gradual kind,
where the rich forest layer shed con-
stantly to renew the fertility of the plains,
but no faster than the trees could re-
place it. It must be realised that this
shedding is continuous and wastage can-
not be prevented; large rivers empty
thousands of tons of rich silt into the sea
annually.
Development of agriculture spelt doom
to much of the forest, and cultivated
land was cleared of trees without thought
to renewal of its fertility. Australia,
sparsely-forested except for its main
watersheds, was treated thus, and present
analysis shows that hardly a tree could
be spared from the maintenance of fer-
tility. But the trees have gone and so to
a large degree has fertility. Rape of the
watershed forests by fire and clearing
has gradually reduced their capacity to
provide water and the regular flooding of
the plains with rich silt. Our inland,
apart from river valleys, was never a land
of highest fertility. Maintained in its
original state,, and coupled with its vast-
ness, this part of the country could have
become one of our most profitable assets.
There is no doubt that the inland was
fiercely and wantonly assaulted by large-
scale farming methods, and much of it
must remain a heavy liability for many
years to come.
The present state of our soil is one
of direst national calamity, which should
be the subject of immediate and compre-
hensive survey. How many districts have
lost one, two or even three inches of rich
organic surface soil? We’ve got to face
facts like this sooner or later, and we
may as well know the answers before it’s
too late to do anything about it. The
speed of destruction during the recent
drought shouldn’t leave anyone in doubt
of that.
Country Gardens.
“Pat o’ Day”: Kikuyu grass, on ac-
count of its subterranean habits of
growth, needs to be removed from close
proximity to shrubs or ornamental palms.
Growing as a lawn, Kikuyu has a tend-
ency to twine its roots about the boles
of trees, shrubs or palms, therefore deep
cultivation with a garden fork and spade
(being careful not to dig too near the tree
base) is required.
Unless the long Kikuyu shoots are
pulled away from the tree base growth
is retarded and palms, particularly, may
stop growing.
Country gardens of the N.S.W. south-
west slopes and Riverina tlxat had
Kikuyu lawns looked well this winter,
the Kikuyu making a perfect foil for
Cocos {Phoenix camriensis ) and other
palms that thrive in these districts.
Couch-grass lawns are not desirable in
country gardens, since they need, as do
buffalo lawns, considerable watering in
summer, and few Australian farms have
summer water to spare for lawns.
Guarding Young Trees.
“Flex”: Here’s a tip for the orchardist
who cannot secure wire-netting to pro-
tect his young fruit trees from rabbits
and _..ier rodents. Sulphonated oil is
prepared by heating linseed oil to 470
deg. F., or, in other words, until it is
smoking hot, and immediately add flowers
of sulphur one part to nine parts of oil
by weight, making a 10 per cent, solu-
tion. Sift the sulphur slowly into the
hot oil and stir it. The mixture will be-
come hotter until all the sulphur is dis-
solved. When it cools apply to the butt,
crotch and limbs of trees with a brush.
This forms a coating which is
not washed off by rain, and rabbits will
go on a starvation diet before touching
it. T
Prepare the mixture in the open, it
has a persistent foul odor that would
repel a Jap. I spilt some last year in our
tool-shed and the memory of it is still
with us.
Border Streams Plan.
“H.P.R.”: No one will deny the de-
sirability of conserving the waters of the
Dumaresq (B. 17/7/’46), especially as a
supplement to a 22in. rainfall, in the pro
duction of lucerne and grazing crops, ou
it has yet to be demonstrated that it J

London wool
sales to start again
in September
NEW COMMITTEE FORMED
Auction sales of wool will be resumed in the London market in September, and will
continue at regular intervals as before the war. Six firms of London Selling Wool Brokers have
formed the Committee of London Wool Brokers to handle wool consigned to the London
market for sale.
Although the constituent firms have pooled their resouries for the most efficient conduct
of wool sales, yet each firm will preserve its separate identity and will continue to maintain its
individual relationship with its clients.
The organisation will be run by an executive committee drawn from the constituent firms,
and will be staffed almost entirely by employees of these firms.
The opening series of sales can hardly include any new clip wool, but the London Brokers
look forward to the early re-appearance in their catalogues of wool consigned to this market
for sale. All Shippers will continue to receive the individual attention of Brokers as they have
done in the past.

grass, which heavily infests the proposed
irrigation area.
At present competent growers refuse to
attempt tobacco growing other than on
virgin land and for one crop only ; after-
wards the land reverts to weeds or at the
most one or two oat crops combined with
lucerne! Lucerne is unable to compete
with nutgrass and eventually disappears.
Although it has been stated that 150,000
tons of fodder and grains could be har-
vested annually from the Queensland
area alone, this is misleading, as with few
exceptions the production of grain other
than oats quickly becomes impossible.
It would appear that wishful thinking
has ignored the facts, and as one with a
lifetime experience of this locality I sug-
gest that investigation by the authorities
interested should precede construction of
this dam, which could easily become a
white elephant.
Hints for the Farm.
“Myrrhee”: No advantage is to be
gained by soaking wheat for pigs, accord-
ing to tests by N.S.W. Department of
Agriculture. Weights of pigs fed on
soaked wheat and pigs fed on dry whole
wheat were almost identical at the con-
clusion of the tests; if anything the pigs
on dry wheat put on a shade more weight.
The tests showed also that little loss of
grain occurs when whole wheat is fed to
pigs in preference to crushed or soaked
grain. By the time the grain has passed
through the alimentary tract most of the
nutriment has already been extracted, and
what appear to be whole grains in the
faeces are merely husks from which the
endosperm and starchy centre have been
extracted.
“Hux”: From now on the deadly tick
will begin to claim dogs. If in tick
country search daily, running the fingers
through to the skin ; watch inside of ears
and between toes. When a tick’s found,
apply turps and clip off at skin level three
minutes later. Female ticks attached four
days leave little hope of recovery.
“Sundowner”: Experiments by Vic-
torian Department of Agriculture have
established that poultry fed on rations
containing oats have done much better
than when oats are omitted from the feed.
This is reassuring to poultry farmers in
view of the present shortage of wheat for
stock-feeding purposes. Oats contain
a larger percentage of fibre than wheat, so
it is recommended that not more than 30
p.c. crushed oats be fed in mash and
30 p.c. in the whole grain ration.
“Lub”: Early tomatoes need all the
afternoon sun they can get, and a break-
wind on the south side is a big advantage.
We grew a market crop in a river bend
one year with these advantages and
topped the market. A late frost seriously
damaged district crops, but ours, though
not covered, was unaffected. The river
on three sides left our garden almost
frost-free.
“Sarina”: Once a punctured wound is
healing (B. 17/7/’46), it can be kept germ-
free if blocked with a pledget of tow
soaked in kerosene, .1 have often done
this to recently inflicted punctured
wounds in horses (after cleaning them
out), and no trouble has followed. For
washing out wounds, hydrogen peroxide
is effective and safe ; inject with a syringe.
“Sheepo”; When taken to a strange
watering place, a trough especially, sheep
will often refuse to drink. A few of the
leaders will take a few sips, shake their
heads and move away and that settles it.
It works sometimes to drive the mob
away for a couple of miles and then bring
them back to the water by another route.
“Bogan Joe”: To preserve galvanised
iron and add 10 years to its life, mix
skimmed milk, not less than two days
old, with cement to the consistency of
paint and put on with ordinary white-
wash brush. The mixture must be kept
continually stirred whilst being used. One
bag of cement will cover an area of
about 2800 sq. feet. Takes on old iron
as well as, if not better than, on new and
dries to a light stone color.
“W.C.Q.”: A broody hen is all right
if you only want a few chicks (B.
26/6/’46). We have an oil-drum cut in
half with a square hole cut in the lower
side. The hen is set in a hollow in
the ground containing sand and grit, and
the half-drum is set over her so that she
faces the entrance. She’s walled in and
roofed over, and can tackle any goanna
trying to get in through the opening.
Some farmers who give their “broodies”
straw-nests put in a few stems of Stink-
ing Roger to drive away lice. Sulphur
sprinkled over the hen is suspected of
throwing off fumes injurious to the de-
veloping embryos in the shells.
“Billjim”: San Jose scale is a most
destructive scale insect which appears on
deciduous trees, causing loss of vigor and
sometimes death of the limbs. The scale
is small and circular with a dot in the
centre. When the fruit is infected a red
coloration appears. The scale can be
controlled on severely-infested trees by
a spray consisting of 2gal. of winter white
oil, 51gal. of lime sulphur and 72|gal.
of water. For light infestation red oil
1 in 20 or lime sulphur 1 in 9 is effective.

Nazi doctrines, but had a certain hypnotic
dependence on Hitler.”
Manchester “Guardian” reported that
Ribbentrop referred to a speech made by
Stalin “suggesting a wish for better rela-
tions with Germany.”
Hitler at first was hesitant, but then be-
came more receptive to the idea. Negotiations
for a commercial treaty were in progress, and
Ribbentrop obtained the Fuhrer’s permission to
investigate possibilities of bringing about a re-
conciliation between National Socialism and
Bolshevism.
Ribbentrop described how he had told the
Russians of Germany’s desire to come to a
peaceful settlement with Poland. Here it was
a question for both Stalin and Hitler to take an
interest in countries that had been lost to them
through an “unfortunate war.” A line of de-
marcation in Poland was therefore agreed to in
the event of “intolerable Polish provocation”
that might lead to war. In such an event Ger-
many and Soviet Russia must not be accused
of collusion. Spheres of interest were closely
defined, not only in Poland, but for the Baltic
countries and Bessarabia.
Schacht and Others
A very different line was taken by
Schacht... “a trenchant indictment of
Hitler and his regime,” said the London
“Times” report, adding:
Schacht’s position is perhaps the most un-
certain of them all; in some respects his case is
one of the main keys of the trial, for its issue
has a clear bearing on pending proceedings
against a large number of German industrialists
and bankers now in custody. We come back to
the old question—the criminal responsibility of
the financiers or armaments magnates in wag-
ing aggressive war.
Schacht on his own showing comes to his
defence as a bitter opponent of Nazi policy,
who was ready, it appears, to go to extreme
lengths to remove Hitler once he saw where
his path was leading. It is certainly the most
solidly-argued defence yet heard.
Schacht speaks with the composure of a man
who feels he has a case, and he has a shrewd
grasp of the case against him. Schacht, in short,
is a man with a grievance, the cosmopolitan
with influential friends in many*lands who,
having joined Hitler as a democrat and a Ger-
man patriot, feels that he has been deceived.
He is clearly not a party to any pact of loyalty
to the Fiihrer made under Goring’s leadership.
The same report went on to state that
Schacht described how, on a visit to
America, he “had read Mein Kampf —a
book written in the worst kind of Ger-
man, the propaganda of a semi-intellec-
tual. Hitler had just won ,100 seats in
the Reichstag, and on his arrival in the
United States Schacht had pointed out
that unless people of foreign countries
changed their policy towards Germany
Hitler would soon gain many more
adherents.
“Schacht said he first met Hitler after
supper at Goring’s modest apartment:
the meal, he recalled, consisted of pea
soup and bacon. Hitler had contributed
about 95 per cent, of the conversation,
but what he said about the national neces-
sities of Germany agreed completely with
his own view. He found nothing in-
herently criminal in the National-Socialist
programme; he had always considered
that the demand for Lebensraum re-
ferred to the former German colonies —
and Schacht made the neat point that it
would have been surprising if the world
for a decade had maintained political and
cultural contact with a country adminis-
tered by a criminal party programme,”
Curious evidence on behalf of Schacht
was given by Dr. Hans Bernhardt von
Gisevius, former German intelligence
agent: —•
Speaking of plots against Hitler, Gisevius
said that Schacht tried in 1938 to exert pressure
on the Fiihrer to prevent war. “Schacht told
me he could not rely on the generals to revolt.”
Gisevius then told how, at a secret meet-
ing in Schacht’s country house, a plot was
hatched between Schacht, himself and Generals
Witzleben and Brockdorf.
Gisevius also said that Schacht’s underground
peace-plotting group carried out their activi-
ties during the war, and attempts were made
by the Vatican to bring the British Govern-
ment into contact with the party. “The Pope
himself was trying to bring about negotiations.”
In the spring of 1943 an attempt was made
to assassinate Hitler by placing a bomb in an
aeroplane taking him to the eastern front. It
failed to explode.
Witness said that if the plots had succeeded
the other defendants in the dock at Nuremberg
would have been behind locked doors, with the
exception of Schacht.
Schacht figured in his defence as “a
German patriot who was ready to pay
lip service to a regime he despised in
order to frustrate Hitler’s plans for war.”
“I would have killed him myself,” he
exclaimed before leaving the witness-box
(London “Times” report).
Very different from Schacht’s “pea
soup and bacon” meeting with Hitler was
that of Julius Streicher. “It was in the
Burgerbrau cellar in Munich in 1921,”
he said. “He had been speaking for three
hours and was drenched in perspiration.
A man sitting next to me said he saw a
halo, and, gentlemen, I felt something
which was not an every-day feeling.
When Hitler had finished his speech, an
inner voice commanded me to get up. I
went to the platform and Adolf Hitler
came down and I told him my name.”
A strange note runs through all reports
of Streicher’s case. Of another part Lon-
don “Times” reported;—-
Raising his voice to a shrill cry, he declared
that after he found himself in Allied captivity
he was kept for four days in a cell without
clothes. “I was made to kiss negroes’ feet. I
was whipped. I had to drink saliva.”
He paused for breath, and then screamed:
“My mouth was forced open with a piece of
wood, and then I was spat on. When I asked
for a drink of water I was taken to a latrine
and told ‘Drink.’ These are the sort of things
the Gestapo has been blamed for.”
Mainly Streicher was charged with hav-
ing “by his anti-Semitism incited a nation
to mass murder” ; his defence was “to
claim the literary licence of a writer im-
bued with ‘prophetic vision.’ ”
London “Times’s” summing up: “The
most unsavory case of the whole trials.”
The main line of former Field-Marshal
Keitel’s defence was that “the soldier is
the tool of the politician.” “It is no
concern of a soldier’s,” he said, “whether
a war is one of aggression or defence ;
once he has had his orders from the head
of the State he has no discretion but to
obey. Nor is it any business of a soldier
to give any thought to whether or not a
war is just.” As N.Y. “Times” reported
Keitel:
“I grew up in that tradition. A professional
officer gives up his personal and private life,
and his life as a soldier comes first. I cannot
say that I thought about political matters at
all. I held the opinion that a soldier in the
confidence of the leader of his State has a duty
to obey.”
Commenting on the case of Donitz the
London “Times” correspondent said:
It is no secret that his presence in the dock,
together with Admiral Raeder, his predecessor,
is not viewed without misgivings in professional
circles, just as the inclusion in the trial of the
soldiers Keitel and Jodi has already evoked
outspoken military comment in the United
States.
It can only be repeated that the prosecution
does not rest its case on the professional
eminence of any of the prisoners. Donitz, like
the others, is charged as a member of a con-
spiracy to wage aggressive war, and, more
closely, with responsibility for crimes on the
high seas such as the murder of survivors of
torpedoed vessels while he was in command of
the submarine arm. His answer to the charges
will be followed intently by British opinion, for
whom the Donitz case is probably the most
controversial of the whole trial.

Admiral Donitz, protesting that for five years
his U-boats had fought a clean war, has
made the same sort of apologia for the German
navy that had already been heard from Keitel
for the professional army.
However well schooled the Donitz defence,
there could be no doubt of the gravity of the
case against him as the British prosecutor, with
bitter insistence, went into the details of the
alleged crimes at sea that cost his country
thousands of lives Nor has the bearing of
any of the accused been more cynical than
Donitz’s was in seeking to justify his orders.

if scores of neutral ships were sunk then they
should not have disregarded warnings to keep
out of the prohibited zone around the British
Isles, which counsel pointed out extended over
an area of 75,000 square miles.
To the question whether the U-boat was
justified in attacking any ship within its zone
without warning, Donitz answered with an
uncompromising “yes”: and having established
his broad argument that the development of
Anglo-American air power and the arming of
merchantmen made it suicidal for a submarine
to surface and carry out rescue operations, he
dismissed the prosecution’s more incriminating
documents by denying knowledge of them or
ascribing their origin to junior officers.

Dictation Test.
“Writer Albert Payson Terhune’s widow
claims he dictated after his death the book she
is publishing.”
I am reminded of a seance I
had with the shade of a Sanskrit
free-verse writer named Ali
Habakkuk one Sunday even-
ing in the wash-house. He
appeared as I was wringing
out the sheets.
“Peace he with you,” said a
voice in fluent Sanskrit sud-
denly, causing me to wring out my beard
and one side of my moustache by mis-
take. >
I replied as courteously as possible
under the circumstances to the faintly
luminous haze which was materialising in
the steam over the copper. It gradually
took the form of an older and more de-
crepit Bernard Shaw, dressed in a saffron
nightshirt and sandals.
“Write! ” said the apparition, and with-
out more ado I pulled a fountain-pen
from the pocket of my newly-laundered
shirt and began on the left cuff. Ali
spoke at about 400 words a minute, and
my sketchy knowledge of Sanskrit short-
hand was not materially assisted by three
of our cats, which fought on the roof
throughout Ali’s dictation.
By the time I had filled both sleeves
arid the back of the shirt with some ex-
ceptionally free verse, Ali was visibly
flagging. Finally, he made an impatient
gesture.
“Enough!” he barked crisply. “Same
time next Sunday.” Then, recalling him*
self to character, he intoned “Peace be
upon your house.”
“And,” he added more practically, with
a glance at the roof, “upon your wash-
house.”
I have never given Ali the chance to
materialise again. I don’t think I could
ace him. After offering his masterpiece
to several publishers I sold it for a tidy
sum, plus royalties, to a designer of fancy
fabrics for sports shirts.

Another Art Exhibition.
The Pre-election Art Exhibition now
being held at the A.L.P. Galleries in Can-
berra contains paintings which range
from neo-primitives to the ultimate in
imagery.
Among them “September Mourn,” by
Ben Chifley, a crowded canvas painted in
“ Whacko , the circus is in town.
Well all gor!”
sombre tones, stands out. It depicts
three wild-eyed figures —one holding a
billhook, another wearing a flannel and
a lamp on his cap and the third clad in a
vertical-striped jersey, a rolled woollen
cap and holding a cocky in a cage—doing
a Dervish dance around a crepe-bound
ballot-box over which' waves the hammer-
and-sickle flag on which is blazoned the
slogan “Preferences to Labor.” In the
middle distance a group of politicians are
frenziedly endeavoring to stop a huge pen-
dulum from swinging.
The artist has succeeded in investing
the picture with a bluish haze, a peculiar
feature of which is that it gets bluer each
day of the exhibition. Faintly discernible
through this is the figure of a smoker
trying to roll a cigarette with sandpaper,
while a near-by serviceman is holding a
doorknob he has somehow acquired and
is waiting to have fitted to it a house,
the blueprints of which Mr. Lazzarini is
sleeping on beside him. A bookie and a
publican are weeping down each other’s
backs, while in a distant paddock aban-
doned railway engine No. 1917 is attached
to surrounding gum-trees with cobwebs.
In his “Abie’s Irish Ruse,” Arthur Cal-
well has painted in his favorite medium
of glycerine. With masterly brush he has
captured the vividly eager expressions on
the faces of a herd of swarthy reffos who,
streaming off the gangplank of the S.S.
Haganah with their waving hands full
of gold votches and chains, are ignoring
the artist’s own eagerly outstretched wel-
coming hand and are bearing down on
another figure wearing an air-force uni-
form on which is hung a gold railway
pass, and whom they naturally assume
will be their first customer in the land
of their adoption. A banner held aloft
among the dense arm-waving crowd still
waiting to disembark bears f be device
“Interest at shent per shent.”
“Capricomia, Here I Go,” a composite
painting by Frankie Forde, contains a re-
markable self-portrait, in which the artist
has captured the right expressions of
fatuity, oleaginousness and self-satisfac-
tion as the subject cups an ear as if wait-
ing to hear a distant report. An original
background shows a goat munching at
the fringes of a mountain of red-tape-
bound paper cylinders. The critics are
divided as to whether the Napoleonic set
to the field-marshal’s hat worn in the
self-portrait is intended as a tribute to
another great military genius or as a
severe rebuke to The Bulletin’s Ted
Scorfield.
The salient feature of “Dehabilitation,
a study in futurism by John Dedman, is
that the artist has succeeded in portraying
a mirage which can be seen through quite
easily. It shows an ex-serviceman, cigar
in mouth, seated at a large desk on which
are two telephones, while he dictates to a
pretty typist. Another notable feature
is that the whole thing is painted through-
out in the one shade of lolly pink. A
really wonderful effect, the artist claims,
can be obtained when the painting is
looked at through rose-colored glasses.
“The Brisbane Lyin’,” by Eddie Ward,
is a crude dirty-water color. It depicts
the artist himself standing on a soapbox
with both his arms to the elbows in mud,
which he is slinging in all directions from
buckets which are being filled by wharf -
laborers. Looking up at the central figure
in some wonder is a small Papuan boy.
In the background can be seen a fuzzy-
wuzzy holding a union card in one hand
while he holds the other out appealing
to a planter who is walking past smoking.

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
The contributor placed first is paid
4i£d. per line; all others 2id. per line.
A Supreme Services Commander
I was surprised that “Three Wars” (B.
17/7/’46) did not draw attention to the
simplified administration and consequent
increase in Army efficiency that followed
the abolition of Military Board con-
trol and the appointment of General
Blarney as supreme commander. This
successful experiment with one service
should surely have been a lesson to the
others.
I was an instructor in military admini-
stration during part of 1943-44 when the
new control was making itself felt. New
G.R.Os. were legion, and keeping in
touch was almost a nightmare at times,
but the new regulations made for sim-
plified administration and removed many
ambiguities. After 1943 the military
machine worked much better, and there
was a fair chance of everyone knowing
his responsibilities and privileges in
all circumstances. These were particularly
hard to determine in the days of Military
Board control.
Two outstanding successes under
G.O.C. control are worth special mention
—Army Book 83 and Army Book 87.
The former was carried by every soldier,
so that he knew, among other things, his
medical position, what clothing he should
have and what leave he should get when
the next opportunity arose. The same
book enabled a unit in the field to dis-
pense with many office records which
were difficult to carry and easy to lose.
Army Book 87 was the demobilisation
instrument containing all the necessary
forms for a soldier’s release. It was a
masterly reduction of complex “admini-
strative routine, and was largely respon-
sible for the smooth working of military
demobilisation.
Neither the R.A.N. nor the R.A.A.F.
took advantage of these excellent ideas,
although their adoption would have been
automatic under unified control.
Towards the end of the war I was
attached to one of those combined Allied
units, whose members were drawn from
the R.A.N., the A.I.F. and the R.AA.F.,
and was thus able to compare military
methods with those of other services.
The R.A.N. was definitely the silent
service on naval administration —it is
apparently traditional for it to be a
mystery to all save the higher command.
I did learn, however, that it was regarded
as a miracle if a naval member of the unit
ever found himself in a place where he
could draw pay.
R.A.A.F. administration seemed even
more complicated. When a member of
the Air Force had to move on duty or
leave, it was first necessary for the more
senior Air-Force officers to sit in con-
ference to decide what were the latest
instructions on movement and to whom
the member really belonged. This having
been settled, the unfortunate member
sometimes had to spend days visiting
various depots, all of which were gener-
ally situated as far apart as possible and
cunningly changed around from time to
time.
In contrast, “military personnel”
could achieve the same object by
one visit to the orderly room to
collect a few copies of one form. The
soldier’s complete history and status were
carried on his person. When the war
ended A.I.F. men collected one book and
moved on smoothly to civil life when
their turn came, R.A.A.F. types again
started a grand tour and collected a
mountain of papers before they were
through. Our system was the envy of the
Air Force, and they could never under-
stand why our Army methods were not
adopted by all services.
I knew nothing of the confusion in the
R.A.A.F. to which Air Vice-Marshal
Bostock has drawn attention, but ineffi-
ciency of minor Air-Force administration
suggested that those in control were either
incompetent or frustrated. There is
surely enough evidence now from com-
parison of various service systems to
prove that unified control of the services
is essential. — Screwball (W.A.).
Defence Needs
I’d like to back up “Permanent Army”
(B, 24/7/’46) in his demand for a Gov-
ernment statement on its plans for a
large standing army. Interim-forces are
no reassurement to defence-minded citi-
zens, and their temporary nature is no
satisfaction to those who wish to make
the army their career.
While this uncertainty exists, trained
men are being lost to the services because
there are so many remunerative civvy
jobs available to a willing worker. And
once in a good civvy position an ex-
serviceman will think very hard before
re-enlisting.
If expense is the cause of the Govern-
ment’s indecision, then attention should
be given to reducing the biggest army of
bureaucrats our country has ever known.
—Jeff (Vic.).
Re-establishment Loans
Ex-servicemen on the land may obtain
loans of up to £250 from the Repatria-
tion Department, or, in special cases, up
to £lOOO. The snag is that the borrower
must have security for the amount bor-
rowed and watertight provision for
Repat. to collect its pound of flesh. It
doesn’t follow that Repat. will act
harshly in cases of hardship, but there
isn’t much scope for the man who comes
out with a bit of deferred pay and the
clothes he stands in and wants to go
farming on his own account. '
Granting of these loans is subject to
the approval of a local repatriation com-
mittee, which is supposed to satisfy it-
self that the mendicant—sorry, appli-
cant—is a suitable type for the particular
branch of agriculture he selects, and to
value his property so that it may be
secured against his diddling the depart-
ment. Final approval is by the board.
In similar circumstances the banks
would be glad to do business, and the
honest borrower would be far better off
dealing with them. There is nothing to be
gained by Repat. loans to ex-servicemen
that a civilian can’t have for the asking
“By cripe , boss, don't y * ever come up for air?"
at a bank. The scheme looks weak to ex-
servicemen who risked their lives for
small pay, lost opportunities of advance-
ment and now can’t be trusted with a re-
establishment loan of £250 without full
security.—F. W. L. (Vic.).
Pay and Promotion
“X,” with pre-war militia experience
to his credit, enlisted in the A.I.F. early
in 1940. He did the job of platoon ser-
geant in Tobruk on a corporal’s pay, and
proved himself a potential officer. Not
until the middle of 1942 could his unit
get him away to 0.C.T.U.; in the mean-
time a dozen reinforcement officers,
most of whom were privates when
Corporal “X” left for the M.E., had
marched in.
Lieut. “X” rejoined his unit at
Alamein, to find that he was junior to a
further batch of reinforcement officers,
some of whom hadn’t enlisted when “X”
was in Tobruk. He went to N.G., where
he won the M.C. By this time he was
second-senior subaltern, but four vacan-
cies for captains were all filled by officers
from a disbanded militia battalion.
This case brings out some of the flaws
in the system of pay and promotion. The
first is the Army’s fondness for cheap
labor. When, because of sickness or
casualties in a unit, an officer or an o.r.
is temporarily performing duties in ex-
cess of his rank the difference in pay over
the period should be met by the Army
on a certificate signed by the C.O.
Should the temporary duties become per-
manent promotion should date from the
day on which the new duties were com-
menced, not from the day on which the
Army sees fit to authorise the promo-
tion.
The next point is that a unit should
be allowed to send one battle-experienced
n.c.o. to O.C.T.U. for every reinforce-
ment officer received. Each time that
“X’s” promotion was delayed Private
Smith and Corporal Brown were
blocked from getting their promotion.
Nobody in authority thought of soften-
ing the disappointment of these o.rs. by
introducing a corporals’ mess, something
better than an extra 6d. a day for the
lance-jack, and a grading of private first
class for the soldier awaiting promotion.
Such reforms are urgently required if
the peace-time Army intends to maintain
the enthusiasm and ambition of the man
in the ranks.
Because seniority applies only in pro-
motions from lieutenant to captain and
from captain to major, the system is full
of inconsistencies. A C.O. decides that
Smith should be commissioned before
Brown, but he isn’t trusted to decide that
Smith will make a better captain than
Jones. In time they both become cap-
tains. The C.O. is now trusted to report
that Smith should be placed on the com-
mand list but that Jones should be left
off. But when a vacancy occurs for a
major Jones receives his crown, even
though the Army has agreed that Smith
is the better officer. Machinery does
exist for the superseding of an officer,
but it is slow-moving. The usual war-
time practice was to “whitewash” the
weak officer by sending him to a base or
training appointment. Surely the Army
has enough confidence in its own choice
of brigadiers and C.Os. to give them
the right to choose their own captains
and majors.— Peter Mike (W.A.).
Red Cross P.-0.-W. Funds
Care of prisoners-of-war is part of the
legitimate work of the Red Cross (B.
17/7/’46), and would have been carried
out if not a penny had been specially
earmarked for the job.
The special fund was inaugurated to
attract people who like a special cause to
subscribe to. Awkwardly, people lost
sight of the grand work of the general
fund, and wanted to devote all their sub-
scriptions to p.-0.-w. Our branch over-
came the problem by sending one month’s
proceeds to the p.-0.-w. and the next to
the general fund. Even then the p.-0.-w.
fund grew to such an extent that branches
were asked to stop adding to it.
It should be recognised that the Red
Cross p.-0.-w. fund was intended only
for prisoners while they were prisoners. It
was not the fault of the society that
prisoners in Japanese hands received so
few parcels.
Dependants of p.-0.-w. who died are—
and should be—the responsibility of the
Australian Government. Red Cross works
under a charter, and cannot —and should
not —be expected to disburse money for
any purpose other than the care of the
sick and wounded and p.-0.-w. —F. H. W,
(S.A.).
Leave
Where did “Bondi Beachcomber” (B.
31/7/’46) get the idea that officers had
the “opportunity of taking home leave
every six months”? G.R.O. 598/43,
which laid down the rules regarding leave
of all types, applied impartially to all
ranks.
An officer was issued with an A.B. 83
which was identical with the A.B. 83
issued to n.c.os. and o.rs. In this his
leave credits were entered and checked
against A.F. 63 held at regimental H.Q.
He was granted leave when he had the
necessary credit, which was governed by
the distance separating him from his home
town. If he was more than 150 miles
away his leave worked out once every
12 months, again depending on transport.
Troops had the option of applying for
compassionate or emergency leave in
addition to normal leave, and this was
granted if it were shown that the soldier’s
presence at home was necessary. An
officer in a field unit was rarely granted
this leave, because he was classed as “key
personnel,” and because most formations
thought it bad for morale to grant officers
more than normal leave, no matter how
deserving their case.
As “B.B.” says, troops often took one
to two weeks’ extra leave. Frequently
this cost them only a £5 fine on return to
their units. All ranks considered this
very cheap for a further seven or 14 days
at home. Officers, however, could not
indulge in this, as such an offence would
have warranted a court-martial with
serious consequences.
Travelling through L.T.Ds. troops were
frequently kept for up to a fortnight in
their own States, because of lack of troop
trains. An officer considered himself
lucky if he managed to get an extra two
or three days while awaiting transport.
“B.B.” scoffs at “Peter Mike’s” charge
that certain types sought detention in
order to dodge campaigns. “Peter Mike”
is right, “B.B.” also says that these
places were detestable and no man would
willingly stay in one. He is right if he
refers to the ordinary decent soldier.
But isn’t he forgetting that the occu-
pants of a place contribute mainly to its
atmosphere, and in this case the dregs
had gravitated to the right spot?—S.T.
(N.S.W.).
“Labor” and Farmers
The Tasmanian Premier recently
described as “thieves” those farmers who
are not prepared to sell their land for
soldier-settlement at Mr. Cosgrove’s
price.
Neither the Premier nor any of his
Ministers has spent the best part of a
lifetime in clearing bush land and work-
ing it through long hours for very small
returns. But they are very sure that land
must remain at pre-war prices, or less.
That would be all right if other things,
including Parliamentary salaries, were
kept at the same level. The fact is that
Mr. Cosgrove and party recently added
£lOO a year to their salaries, taking the
consent of the people for granted. Still,
their new tenderness for the soldier may
impress some of the people.—E. & O. E.

This Happy Land
Recently I received a letter from an
English friend who has been reading a
pamphlet obtained from Australia House,
London. He wants to know if I can help
him when he arrives here and “put him
up till he settles down” in this “happy
land of sunshine and opportunity.” Here
is a precis of my reply:
“I have been living for nine months in
a flat at ruinous rent, while searching for
a house. At last, after competing with
hundreds of other applicants, I’ve got a
cottage, ‘site unseen, take it or leave it.’
It has three rooms and a kitchen. One
room is floorless because of white ants;
the lobby floor is unsafe for the same
reason and several panes are missing from
the windows. I managed to get a few
sticks of furniture and moved in with the
wife and kids. No timber or glass is
obtainable for repairs, and we have no
bath-heater, wash troughs, copper, fire-
wood, axe or other sundries.
“At time of writing gas and electricity
are severely restricted. They may cut out
altogether. Industries are closing down
for lack of coal and transport is at its
last gasp. Thousands are unemployed and
general chaos threatens. This is written
by candle lijßt; press cuttings are en-
closed. Welcome if you can take it.”—
Hope and Glory (S.A.).
Reading for Children
Twenty years ago the child who had
passed the “Comic-Cuts” stage had a
wide choice of commendable reading
open to it —“The 8.0. P.,” “Chums,”
“Magnet,” “The Schoolgirl’s Own” and
others. The stories were competently
written, the tone was healthy, and the
King’s English treated with the respect
it deserves. From these periodicals it
was not a long step to Treasure Island
and Hereward the Wake, and from
there to the world of good books. }
tried recently to get some of these peri-
odicals for a youngster. The bookseller
told me that he hadn’t seen them for
years —“perhaps they are no longer
published.” All he could offer were
“The Adventures of Buck Rogers” or a
“Superman Special,” the modem child
apparently being more diverted by car-
toons and balloon speech than by the
pleasures of reading.
There seems to be something wrong
with a generation of youngsters which
no longer hero-worships cowboys, foot-
ballers and Billy Bunter, but prefers the
quaintly-clad and more quaintly-spoken
heroes offered by the Yankee comics,
invariably with a long-haired mate in
tow —enough, in itself, to turn the
stomach of a boy in my day.
Australian publishing houses should
give some thought to the question ot
child literature. It is in their own inter-
ests to educate and foster in the youth
of Australia a taste for good reading, or
they’ll find themselves without customers
in a few generations. — Junius Jr. (Q-)'


Housing
Within a radius of 200 yards 1 can
see a five-roomed cottage occupied by
one old man, a six-roomed home occu-
pied by one middle-aged man, a six-
roomed house occupied by a father and
adult son and several large homes hous-
ing only one couple each. This is a
working-class district, but it is typical of
wealthier suburbs, where large homes
capable of housing several families are
occupied by only three or four persons.
In normal times, of course, a man is
entitled to have a home as large as he
likes, but these are not normal times, and
it would be well to ascertain just what
housing space is being wasted. —W. P. T.
(N.S.W.).
Building—and Bunk
In Victoria “uniform” building regula-
tions introduced within the last 18
months have raised minimum require-
ments in many municipalities and forced
home-builders to spend a great deal more
than was previously considered neces-
sary. In some cases, no doubt, it has
put home-building out of the question.
The municipality in which I own a
block of land now insists that I cannot
build to less than ten squares, although
nine were sufficient until a year or so ago.
That means another £llO if I build in
timber or £l5O if I build in brick. I
can’t cut costs by building a big verandah
for the youngsters to sleep on because,
for municipal purposes, verandahs count
as only half their area.
The Government is spending £lO,OOO
and using enough bricks for half a dozen
houses to build a railway station to re-
place the wooden structure (still in good
order) at the seaside suburb where I live.
In normal times half the houses are un-
occupied except during the summer holi-
days, and the number of train-travellers
is small. But it seems that someone
promised the place a new station years
ago. Whoever is responsible is making
sure that his department doesn’t go short
of bricks and mortar, no matter how
many families are living in single rooms
and shanties. — Wusslean (Vic.).
Express Delivery
An airmail letter from Britain has
reached this Tasmanian household in an
astonishingly shfort time. Posted on the
21st, it arrived here on the 29th. Another
letter, from Sydney, was posted at 11.30
a.m. on July 5. It arrived here on the
18th, correctly addressed and with full
postage. It wasn’t airmail, but had it
been a human passenger instead of a
letter it would have reached Tasmania on
the third day instead of the 13 th.
Anyway, isn’t all first-class mail matter
supposed to be carried by air between
the mainland and Tasmania? —M. L. M.

Those Dutch Ships
I came back from the Middle East in
the Voyager. She was in a bad way
and was limping home. We broke down
outside Sourabaya, and in no time the
Dutch had us in harbor, with all the
crew ashore in various homes, while their
dockyard fixed our engines. Imagine
our feelings if the Dutch had signalled
“We can’t help you. Moscow says no.”
Personally, I think that the people re-
sponsible for boycotting the Dutch ships
would not even obey the first unwritten
law of the sea —“Women and children
first.”
Anyway, every time I pass a Dutch
sailor I feel like apologising.— Sextant
(N.S.W.).
Catchment Protection
The catchment areas of the Murray
and other important rivers heading in the
Alps are in better condition than at any
time for the last ten years. Last summer,
though it began dry, had regular falls of
rain, fires were fewer and their damage
small, and recent heavy rains have filled
the mountains to overflowing. Springs
long dry and almost forgotten have
started running again.
The cover of scrub and fern, periodi-
cally burned, is regaining its sponge-like
capacity for sopping up the rainfall.
Burned-out spurs and ridges, which shed
water like a duck’s back, and remain
bone-dry beneath the surface, are on the
long road to recovery. Feeder springs to
the creeks and rivers will run steadily
for a long time now the mountains are
thoroughly saturated.
The point is that the catchments are
only as good as their absorbent covering
of small vegetation, and regular and
widespread burning in the past has de-
prived the rivers on which we lean more
and more heavily for irrigation of enor-
mous quantities of water. With present
reservoirs there should never be a serious
shortage on the Murray network.
The Australian Alps and sub-alpine
regions are in the main Crown lands, and
forest reserves and their care naturally
come within the scope of the two State
Governments. Their interest in future
development of Murray irrigation settle-
ments should be shown first by protecting
the source of water. A joint fire protec-
tion authority should be set up now and
amply staffed to deal effectively with the
fire problem of the catchments. With
the present growth of scrub some very
serious and widespread fires may occur
during a dry period this summer. But it
will be too late then to do much about it.
—Esk D. (Vic.).
The Right to Work
Miners’ “spokesmen” went to Canberra
to tell Mr. Chifley that “the power to
deprive men of the right to work in the
industry is thoroughly obnoxious to the
Federation.”
If they really meant these words, what
changes there would be! There would be
an end to “dargs” and other enforced
restrictions of output. Every miner
would have the right to work as hard as
he liked and at least for the legally-set
hours.
The childish slogan “one out all out”
would also go. If one man couldn’t —
or wouldn’t —work because his bootlaces
or toothbrush or something were missing,
his mates would still be free to carry on.
Nor would there be any more fuss
about non-unionists, or any such thing
as a “scab.” A man who refused to strike
would simply be exercising his right to
work. Such tactics as “resigning” and de-
claring the job black would naturally be
discarded. Strikers would take no action
against newcomers who chose to step into
their shoes. In fact, a strike would
merely be the practice of the comple-
mentary right not to work if the job
didn’t suit.
But of course the “spokesmen” don’t
“ I really shouldn't be ’ere today , Jim —me grey ound's got a touch
o' distemper .”
mean what they say. What is really “ob-
noxious” to them is any proposal to
weaken their own tyrannical control over
the right to work in the industry. Arc
(N.S.W.).
Murraysiders
My impression of the Riverina and its
people is that of an unwilling satellite
province and subjects of N. S. Wales and
its unsympathetic Sydney-controlled Gov-
ernment. The interests of the Riverina are
closely associated with those of feilow-
Murraysiders on the other side, and there
is grand material between them for de-
velopment of their joint resources. Re-
mote control from both sides, centred in
two thickly populated cities, is a decided
hindrance. .
The Riverina has had the worst of it
with difficulties in transporting its pro-
duce to its logical port over an ambigu-
ous border. The sympathy of Murray-
siders in Victoria is keen. The close links
and friendships along the Murray can be
welded if the people are allowed to
choose their own destiny. A State com-
prising the Murray Valley and the River-
ina would handle its own problems and
forge ahead rapidly. A million people or
more will eventually settle in. the area,
and their strength will lie in refusing to
be split into two camps under remote
control. —X. E. D. (Vic.).
English Usage
Australia is threatened with an invasion
from the British Isles.
The immigrants will all speak much the
same language, but the words used will
often differ dangerously in their intention.
Offence may be given or taken where
none is intended, and even compliments'
can become insults. As a Pommy who
learned the Aussie lingo the hard way I
offer a couple of samples from a collec-
tion of thousands.
Wishing to compliment a carpenter
who was doing some house repairs for
me, I said, “Carry on, mate. You’re mak-
ing a real home of the place.” That
nearly bought me a fight. Chips thought
I was accusing him of deliberate loafing
and a long explanation was necessary to
soothe his feelings.
Asked to describe a dear old absent
friend who lived a saintly life and pos-
sessed a natural tonsure, I said he re-
minded me of an ancient monk. In due
time he was told that I had described him
as a wowser who looked like an old
monkey. It lost a valued friendship.
As a Dickens fan I used to quote
Micawber and his frailties until a well-
meaning hostess warned me not to men-
tion my cobber before the children, as they
were apt to judge me by my friends.

Parliamentary Broadcasts
When Canberra was selected for the
Federal capital, one argument in favor
was that Parliament should be as far
away as possible from the influence of
the big centred of population. After
visiting the national Parliament, it seemed
to me that one good reason for the isola-
tion was that it might enable us to retain
some of our illusions about the dignity
of the legislature.
Now, foolishly for some of themselves,
members have dispelled whatever illusions
we may have had by going on the air. Per-
haps the “Government” will reduce
listeners’ licence fees, since we have been
deprived of one of our radio stations dur-
ing the Parliamentary sessions—surely
we’re not expected to pay for what we
may hear from Canberra. — Elector (Tas.).
Car Prices
I have an eight-year-old car which has
been exceptionally well cared for and
had little use while I was in uniform.
Circumstances having changed, I con-
sidered doing without a car for a year or
two. The pegged price quoted by the
Prices Branch, however, is ridiculous,
considering the value of money nowa-
days, the state of the car market and the
present selling price of the same model
when new. *
On mentioning the matter at my service
station I was immediately offered £lOO
over pegged price—cash then and there.
The upshot is I won’t sell at all. Some-
thing about blackmarketing sticks in my
gullet, and (possibly the real reason) I
might be the unlucky one to be caught.
The car is worth more to me than I can
legally get for it. If pegged prices were
abolished, or at least given a lift,
many more vehicles would assuredly
come on the market. This would not
only help break the blackmarket but
would help many people in desperate
need of a car at a fair price.— Still Got
It (Vic.).
Should They Have Votes:
I won’t choose any weapon deadlier
than the pen, “J.8.C.” (B, 24/7/’46), for
I did not even hint that my larrikins bore
any military brand either in airs or dress.
The question of votes for 18-year-olds
is now a live one, but my question was
“Should larrikins have votes?” True,
there are many young heroes worthy of
the franchise, but does that qualify all
youths? If so, it would be equally logical
to disqualify the heroes because of the
larrikins.
The young heroes were trained and dis-
ciplined before being entrusted with com-
mands and equipment. What training has
the average youth of 18 in legislation or
the choice of legislators?
If taxpaying is a criterion of fitness to
vote then all the kids are eligible, for they
are all taxed indirectly. Many of our
young heroes were volunteers for service.
The larrikins I described were certainly
not volunteers for taxation, and were
certainly not trying to make the land fit
for “J.B.C.’s” heroes to live in.
There are youths of 18 who have
university diplomas. They have earned
them. That is no reason why every other
youth in the land should have a diploma.
Yet that is how “J.B.C.’s” brain works.
He says in effect: “I and my young
mates did our bit. We have earned the
vote. Don’t dare to say we resemble
larrikins in any way. At the same time
don’t dare to deny .the larrikins the trust
and the votes we have won.” Few will
agree.— Ditto (S.A.).
All Rights
Recently a short-story of mine was
accepted by an Australian magazine.
Accompanying the editorial cheque was
a contributor’s notice to be signed and
returned with the declaration that “this
material is original and unpublished pre-
viously, and in consideration of the above
payment I consign to the proprietors all
copyright included therein.” •
Perceiving some threat—existing or
implied—to the rights of authors and
tyros, I substituted “First Australian
Serial Rights” for the words “all copy-
rights,” signed the form and returned it.
In the U.S.A; —where the policy of seven
out of nine leading pulp houses has been
to demand “all rights” with the purchase
of material —writers are at last voicing
their protests against the practice. By his
sale of “all rights” the writer forfeits
any further claims for payment on re-
publication of his material. If his work
is reprinted in digests, anthologies or
journals overseas, all payments will accrue
to the original publisher, with no benefit
to the author apart from the privilege
of viewing his name in print.
Some American publishers claim that
the practice was instituted as a measure of
self-protection, as many authors who re-
tained certain rights were immediately
reselling their material at lower rates to
a rival publication, which in some in-
stances actually appeared on sale before
the publication of the original.
The remedy would be a proviso that
material resold could not be published
without acknowledgment to the original
publisher. — Atlanta (Q.).
The Professions
“Professor” (B. 3/7/’46) does not state
the full case for professional men. A
situation exists today where fishermen,
axemen, rabbit-trappers and wharf-
laborers can earn more than most doctors,
dentists and chemists. This will probably
be reflected in the attitude of students in
choosing a career—a study of the relative
rewards for years of training in a profes-
sion and a few months’ rabbit-trapping in
the hills does not offer much encourage-
ment to a budding doctor or dentist.
But the position is only symptomatic of
the times and no indication of the future
status of the professions. ~
The present abnormal demand for cer-
tain goods and services is brought about
by scarcity, timber, fish, furs, etc., bring-
ing top prices in the open market and
even higher prices in the blackmarket.
There is no blackmarket for , the services
oh professional men.
“Professor” can take comfort in the
knowledge that men who have spent time,
money and brains in earning degrees and
the status of a profession have something
more than a temporary increase in finan-
cial return. They have the accumulated
wisdom and knowledge of the great men
who went before them, and the oppor-
tunity of translating this into service to
the community—a service which is not
dependent on the price of timber, fish or
rabbitskins—Bozo (Vic.).
Art in Melbourne
Melbourne’s Public Library is a Cin-
derella compared with the affluent
National Gallery. Endowed with wealth
that is still accumulating, the Gallery has
been able to splash money on showpieces,
and many results of bad taste now repose
in the vaults or have been inflicted on
budding provincial galleries.
Now “modernism” and “super-modern-
ism” is the battlecry and the last tew
years have seen the acquisition of so-
called contemporary works of art which
were the vogue in Europe years ago and
which now reach our shores as backwash.
A National Gallery has a definite
mission. It should present evolution in
artistic expression with some semblance
of a system. We need good examples of
the various artistic epochs, properly classi-
fied and hung in some chronological
order. Only then will the gallery func-
tion as a valuable guide to students and
an education to the public at large.
Australian artists would derive more
benefits if some of the Felton money
could be used to facilitate study m Europe
for young deserving painters. Felquest

Mr. Ward’s Department
" Mr. Ward has appointed an official to
inquire into “wages and conditions of
natives in New Guinea.
New Guinea natives can only be em-
ployed under rigid labor conditions well
known to both employers and Govern-
ment officials. If a postage stamp will
not bring the required information to Mr.
Ward, why doesn’t he earn his salary by
administering his department so that it will?
By wasting the taxpayers’ money, Mr.
Ward probably imagines he is fighting
inflation. He has a lot of queer notions
about fighting.— Ex-Papua (Vic.).


Towards a Mew
VP DAY
•. when our industrial efforts give Australia
victory on the peace-time production front
AUSTRALIA’S prosperity depends upon pro-
duction. Only increased individual and
collective production of practically every
item necessary to our peacetime was of life can
overcome the difficulties facing us as the aftermath
of total war.
Inflation and black market dangers will be pro-
gressively reduced as the output of consumer goods
increases.
The answer to the housing shortage obviously
lies in greater output of raw materials essential to
the building trades which have in turn their produc-
tion goals and responsibilities.
Increased production is the economic band
waggon on which every Australian may ride to
prosperity. It means more of the material
essentials—food, shelter, clothing; a quicker return
to the fuller enjoyment of life, and a richer national
wealth.
In her outstanding wool and wheat production,
coupled with an efficient steel industry, Australia has
the basic nucleus for unbounded national develop-
ment. In addition, a rare chance exists to win rich
export markets.
The creative use to which our national assets are
put will measure our victory on the production
front. The rewards offering for all to share are
truly great.
