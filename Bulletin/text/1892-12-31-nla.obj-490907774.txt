ESTABLISHED in 1886.
This eminent Specialist is a graduated physician of
Harvard University, U.S., registered by the Governments
of N.S.W. and N.Z., and has devoted Sixteen Years
to the special study of the CHRONIC and SKIN
DISEASES of MEN and WOMEN. All applying
to him will receive his honest opinion of their com-
plaints. No experimenting ; no mercury used. A posi-
tive cure guaranteed or forfeit £2OO. His vast experience
tells him that where there is no organic disease, and
nothing but an inorganic trouble, or, in other words, a
conglomeration of symptoms producing a certain result,
there is no reason why it cannot be removed with the
E roper remedies : therefore he guarantees. He claims to
e the most skilful ana successful physician in N.S.W. in
his particular speciality, viz., the CHRONIC DISEASES
of MEN and WOMEN.
Examination and Advice Free to all.
Office Hours : 10 to 12 a.m.; 2to 4 and
J to 8 p.m.
In consequence of the prevailing
HARD TIMES,
Dr. SPEER has determined to REDUCE his FEES to
■exactly ONE-HALF of those usually charged, and he
trusts that this will prove itself
GOOD HEWS INDEED
to those thousands of poor but honest sufferers, who,
though willing to pay a small fee proportionate to their
■means are quite unable to pay the enormous charges so
often made.
Dr. SPEER wishes it to be distinctly understood that
his charge is INCLUSIVE, and that when once he takes a
curable case in hand he names a fee which includes all
advice, attendance and medicines until the patient is
completely cured. It therefore naturally becomes his
object to cure his patient as quickly as possible.
NERVOUSNESS.
CONSULT Dr. SPEER in all cases of NERVOUSNESS
and WEAKNESS, for his many years of practice with
these diseases enables him to remove all traces of them,
and to return the victims to full VIGOR and HEALTH.
N.B.— TWENTY SHILLINGS is sufficient to
send for remedies necessary for the cure of
NERVOUSNESS and WEAKNESS.
In all oases of
WEAKNESS consult Dr. SPEER.
LIVER AND KIDNEY COMPLAINTS consult Dr.
SPEER.
ASTHMA consult Dr. SPEER.
BLOOD DISORDERS consult Dr. SPEER.
SKIN DISEASES consult Dr. SPEER.

“CUCKOO!”
"He could say fearlessly that, far from there being any sort of rivalry between him and the venerable gentleman, he was prepared, so long as Sir Henry Parkes
was connected with public life—so long as he was well and strong enough to undertake the duties and cares of leadership-he (Mr. Reid) was ready to accept and
follow that leadership.”— G. II. Reid, at the N.S.W Commercial Traveller s’ dinner.
“It is well known that the cuckoo does not make any nest of its own but places its egg in the nest of some small bird such as the hedge-warbler or the pied wag-
tail. The little bird does not detect the imposition but hatches the interloper together with her own young. The mother meanwhile sits by uttering her monotonous
“cuckoo—cuck-oo." —Natural History.

Wanted—Cheap Justice.
The rejection, by a large majority of the New
South Wales Council, of the bill to reduce the
cost of litigation, is a circumstance which can
hardly be termed unexpected. During recent
years various measures, ostensibly tending
towards the same end, have been introduced
in nearly every province of Australasia, and
with hardly an exception they have been
ignominiously rejected. In most cases they
deserved no better fate. There was hardly
a semblance of originality about any one of
them. They all proposed to repair the old-
established cancer, and not one was directed at
its excision. In almost every case they started
fairly enough, on the assumption that the law
exists chiefly for the benefit of lawyers; that
lawyers exist principally to obscure the truth
in the interests of moneybags, and ruin clients,
and pervert the course of equity ; and that,
under the present regime, justice is a com-
modity which is too expensive for any save a rich
man to purchase. And then they invariably
proposed to leave the system as it was, and
merely to patch some small detail of the busi-
ness—to stop one of the thousand leaks through
which the litigant’s money dribbles away, to be
lost in the great sea of fraud and parchment
and red tape, while the other 999 remained as
before. This was the purpose of the best of
the so-called reforms ; the others merely pro-
posed to> replace some cumbrous, foolish and
expensive process in the legal burlesque with
another process as cumbrous and as foolish,
and often a trifle more expensive, than the one
to be superseded.
• # •
The first step towards legal reform is an
adequate realisation of the evils to be remedied.
These are far too many to be even enumerated
in the limits of one article, but a few of the
more conspicuous are as follows :—The laws are
mostly made by lawyers whose interest
it is to make them so complicated and ob-
scure as to defy the comprehension of any but a
trained specialist, and so effectually has this
been accomplished that hardly any two
specialists ever agree as to the meaning of a
statute unless they are paid a largo sum for
doing so. The method of setting the law in
operation is so complicated that hardly any but
a specialist who has received a heavy fee can
find the spring which starts the machine work-
ing. The client in any important civil case has
to hire at least two separate cormorants—he
may have to hire six, but two, the solicitor and
the barrister, form the minimum—before he can
get a hearing; he has to tell his case to one
cormorant and then pay him to tell it to the
other cormorant. When he has done this he
has no more substantial guarantee that his case
will be attended to than before ho started ; if
the second cormorant doesn’t turn up, and
the case is lost and the client ruined for want
of him, the bill has to bo paid all the
same, and there is no semblance of redress.
The legal profession has become so degraded
that it is held as an honourable action to up-
hold a foul and glaring wrong with the full
knowledge that it is a wrong, to win the case
of the meanest swindler by means of technicali-
ties which have no bearing whatever on the
merits of the cause, and to defraud the poor
and rob the widow and defeat the just demands
of the oppressed on account of some informality
or other in the filling up of some useless paper
that merely exists to be stuck on a file and left
there to rot. And, in addition to this, it is a
praiseworthy and strictly professional thing to
prop up any soulless swindler by casting lying
aspersions on anybody and everybody who
stands in the way.
* # #
Furthermore, the judges have, in many
instances, practically abdicated their functions.
It is a point of legal etiquette with many judges
to know only as much of the law concerning
the case as is sot forth by the barristers on
each side. Therefore the man who is compelled
by poverty to conduct his own case, or to put
up with a cheap and inefficient barrister, or
whose barrister fails to put in an appear-
ance, frequently has a decision given against
him, even when the judge, who gives that
decision, is well aware that the law is
distinctly in his favour, simply because
the judge’s attention has not been officially
drawn to some particular point of law
by a high-priced functionary in horse-hair.
Moreover, in a very large proportion of cases
the judges give decisions which they cheerfully
admit to be unjust, simply because some one of
the hundred thousand useless formalities re-
quired by the system of lawyer-made law has
not been duly complied with. The idea that
justice goes before law, and that the eternal
truth is of more account than the proper initial-
ling of some mouldy blue-paper form, is a thing
far beyond the range of the ordinary judicial
intelligence. And even all this is only a small
part of the great conundrum. It is the first
duty of every citizen to obey the law ; to obey
the law he must know what it is ; to know
what it is he must be able to find it. Yet not
only does no single layman in Australia know
the law or know where to find it, but no single
lawyer or judge in this continent is able to
efficiently direct him. The law is partly made
up of the sediment of old, forgotten, disused
anil semi-obsolete English statutes written in a
barbarous jargon in the Middle Ages, partly of
legends, customs, and wildly confused, contra-
dictory, and half-forgotten precedents, and
partly of many hundred deranged and incom-
prehensible local enactments written in that
murky dialect peculiar to the legal intellect,
and amendments thereon, and patches put upon
the amendments. There is no compendium of
it to be found or bought anywhere ; it is all
confusion and utter bewilderment and a sense-
less, purposeless, useless groping in the dark.
# * #
If this nefarious system is ever to be reme*
died, the reform must begin at the bottom.
Hitherto it has only been feebly attempted at
the top. In the first place, all the existing
statutes of every Australasian province should
be embodied in a code, and everything outside
the code should be abolished, so that there shall
be no more erratic decisions based on enact-
ments of ancient Plantagenet and Tudor
kings which have been unearthed from their
musty repose to pervert the course of justice,
The code should be periodically revised so that
it may be, as far as possible, an epitome of the
entire legal system of the country. At each
revision an attempt should be made to condense
the law into a smaller compass, to make its
meaning more and more distinct, and to make
the forms of legal procedure less and less com-
plicated, The pleadings on either side should
lie confined to statements of facts whereby the
intelligent layman and the legal specialist
would be placed practically on an equality ; and
the law should be supplied by the judge only.
The assumption that the judge doesn’t know
the civil law and can’t grasp the facts
unless he is informed of it and then by a
costly advocate, so that if one side has an
indifferent barrister or no barrister at all he
only knows as much of the law as is pointed
out by the other side is a gross perversion of
justice in favour of the rich and to the disad-
vantage of the poor. Even if this innovation
required that the number of judges should be
doubled or trebled it would be well worth the
outlay. And, above all things, it should be
recognised that litigation is an umnixed evil
which it is the business of the law to diminish
to the uttermost, and that the law exists, not
to support lawyers, but to make lawyers un-
necessary.
• « »
In Norway there prevails a system which,
with very slight alterations to suit difference of
social conditions, would prove a stupendous
boon to the lawyer-ridden land of Australia. It
consists of local courts of arbitration through
which all civil cases, great and small, must pass
before they can reach the superior courts. They
are widely diffused throughout the country, so
that every man can find justice within a reason-
able distance of his home. They are bound to
hear every case within a certain number of days
—seldom more than fourteen—of its inception.
They are also bound to render their decision
within a fixed period after hearing. No lawyers
are allowed to appear on either side; each
party must state his case in person, or through
the medium of a friend, but no paid advocacy is
recognised. The whole cost of a law-suit
hardly ever exceeds a few shillings. The de-
cisions of the court may be appealed against
and the case heard in the higher courts with all
the customary legal paraphernalia, but the party
making the appeal is required to pay the entire
expenses of the suit. As a natural result
appeals are comparatively few, and the great
bulk of the litigation begins and ends in
the local courts. Their decisions do not
always give satisfaction, but they are fully
as satisfactory as those of the most expensive ■
law court yet invented, and they have at least
one advantage which no civil court in Australia
has ever yet possessed—they-never ruin any
litigant in costs, or absorb the whole amount
in dispute and leave nothing but the bill of
costs for all parties concerned.
# * *
This Bulletin is not sufficiently sanguine to
suppose that any such system will ever be
enacted by any of the present lawyer-ridden
Parliaments of the Australias. It is a common
saying that the only thing more ruinous than
law is arbitration, and as the latter principle is
applied in Australia, the statement is strictly
true. When an arbitration court is established
in this country, the first proceeding is to
appoint a dozen briefless, and often brain-
less, barristers, at high salaries, as assessors,
clerks of awards, assistants, associates and
general hangers-on. Then several tons of
elaborate forms are laid in, which have to
be filled up according to certain cast-iron
rules before the court takes cognisance
of anything; and a huge table of costs and
charges is drawn up ; and expensive barristers
are admitted to conduct the proceedings, with
junior barristers and solicitors to assist them,
at fees quite as exorbitant as those levied in the
Supreme Court; and the applicant who tries
to conduct his case without any array of
counsel is as helpless under the new system as
under the old. Whenever any measure for
reducing the cost of litigation is propounded
the legal element in the Legislature proceeds to
amend it and tack on elaborate formalities of
all sorts and descriptions, until the cheap
justice of the future becomes even more costly
and more inaccessible than the expensive
justice of the past. And so Ipng as the nation
gives its support, at Parliamentary elections, to
barristers and magnates in horse-hair, it
deserves no better fate.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The " Meejum of Exchange.”
For several years past the commercial papers
have been afflicted with great slabs of massive
literature about mono-metallism and bi-metal-
lism, the “ meejum of exchange,” the apprecia-
tion of gold, the depreciation of silver, and
similar dreary topics. Also, a Silver Confer-
ence has been held somewhere, and it is gene-
rally agreed that something desperate must be
done to keep up the price of the metal out of
which half-crowns are constructed. Mean-
while silver, in view of the fact that that
blessed substance is getting every day more and
more plentiful, won’t keep up, any more than
oats or potatoes will when the supply is twice
as large as the demand—instead, it keeps going
down daily and there are no signs of bottom
anywhere.’ Therefore, as the subject is getting
exceedingly wearisome, The Bulletin would
suggest that the melancholy mineral should be
allowed to go down as far as it wants to. The
time is apparently at hand when (unlike gold,
which probably costs £0 or £7 per ounce all
round to get) silver will be a precious metal no
longer. It was precious simply because it was
scarce, and when it ceases to be scarce noth-
ing on earth can make it precious any longer.
It is going the same way as cats, rabbits, tulips,
shells, papal indulgences, cauls, and other
valuables have gone; they were all exceed-
ingly precious at one time, and they all
became common and lost their value in turn.
Silver can’t be permanently kept up even by
making it legal tender, any more than iron can
be kept up by the same process ; the time
will come when there will be more of it
than is wanted even as legal tender, and
then it will go down once more till it finds
its own level, whatever that level may be.
Silver at present is partly a disease and partly
a god ; it is a deity carved out of a chunk of
senseless ore, and the world having lost its
respect for the deity it has dropped to a heavy
discount, as all manufactured gods do sooner or
later. If silver is made a legal tender to an
unlimited extent, and everybody who has a
debt to collect can be compelled to take a
barrow-load of it in payment, it will doubtless
be good for the silver kings of the present
generation, and in like manner if copper were
made legal tender and a man had to take
240,000 pennies in a truck-in return for a £lOOO
cheque, it would materially boom tlie copper
industry, which is likewise in a languishing
condition and much in need of a little ex-
traneous support. But, after all, either process
only amounts to declaring by Act of Parliament
that a shilling’s worth of metal shall be eighteen-
pence, which is much the same as enacting that
two pairs of boots shall be three pairs and a
hat, and the inevitable end of either process is
just the same.

H.S.W. Gaol “ Discipline.”
On December 8, The Bulletin drew attention
to the case of Mr. John Hurley when awaiting
trial in Darlinghurst prison, Sydney. Hurley
was, “in the eye of the law,” as innocent
as the Chief Justice himself or any other
citizen of spotless repute ; he was an uncon-
victed man, and though an accusation (of which
he has since been acquitted) was hanging over
his head that made absolutely no difference
from the legal standpoint. Nevertheless,
according to his own statements, he was treated
like a convicted felon, stripped, shoved into a
scalding bath, confined in a freezing cell,
searched, deprived of everything down to his
pocket-handkerchief, ordered about in a brutally
insulting fashion by various small jacks-iu-
office, commanded to salute the miserable little
potentates of the gaol, and subjected to other
acts of small-minded tyranny. The Govern-
ment “inquired into” these charges and found
them altogether baseless—that is to say, they
asked the accused if they were guilty and were
informed by the accused that they weren’t
guilty, and as Hurley was not allowed to be
present to prove his charges the matter ended
comfortably. Since then The Bulletin has
been assured by independent evidence that
Hurley’s statements are absolutely true — in
fact, thatthey only express abaction of thetruth.
A citizen who spent 17 days in Darlinghurst
awaiting his trial—at which trial he was
promptly (and it is plain, justly) acquitted—
has called on us, and presents to us a pleasant
picture of that institution. The remand men—
many of whom are innocent in fact and all of
whom are innocent in law until convicted—are
treated practically as felons. They have to
“ salute the Governor,” and the man who, pro-
bably from ignorance, doesn’t salute, gets 24
hours’ dark cells on bread and water, not by
the Governor’s orders, but by those of some
irresponsible warder or turnkey. All their pro-
perty is taken from them ; if even a pencil is
found in their possession it means another 24
hours’ dark cells. They are fed on the regula-
tion loathsome hominy. If they want to write
a letter they must apply to the warder and tell
him to whom they want to write and what they
intend to say. If he thinks the matter of suffi-
cient importance he passes the request on to a
higher official, and if Jie thinks it of suffb
cient importance the permission is granted.
When the letter is written the warder amuses
himself by reading it, and if it doesn’t seem
suitable in his bloodshot eye, he refuses to pass
it on. If it gets to the deputy-governor he
reads it, and if he doesn’t like its tone he
refuses to pass it ©n. When the answer comes
it is read by the deputy-governor, but when he
has passed it—which he does if its tone is
sufficiently respectful—the warders also read it,
and when they are quite done with it it gets to
its destination, unless it contains something
which some warder doesn’t like, in which case it
is probably destroyed. (This system of filtra-
tion is very much like that practised on the
daily papers, where the disagreeable facts that
the reporter doesn’t like are suppressed before
they reach the sub-editor, and the facts the
sub-editor doesn’t like are suppressed before
they reach the editor, and the facts that the
editor doesn’t approve of are suppressed before
they get to the proprietor, and the news which
the proprietor doesn’t approve of is suppressed
before it reaches the public, and therefore the
public only hears what all four of them are
quite willing that it should hear.) A man
awaiting trial who isn’t sufficiently servile, and
doesn’t salute with punctuality, seldom gets
any letters at all. If he complains to the
Governor, he has to do it through the warder,
or in the warder’s presence, and he generally
gets into trouble shortly afterwards. Darling-
hurst prison is apparently much in want of a
public inquiry—one at which both sides of the
case will be heard—not the usual hole-and-
corner proceeding at which the Minister asks
the accused if they ever did anything wrong,
and they return a unanimous verdict that they
never did, whereupon the matter drops and
everybody’s character is completely vindicated.
Tire N.S.W. "Coalition” Ambush.
E. W. O’Sullivan, M.L.A., the Parliamen-
tarian who, more than any other, owes his
public standing and his income for the past few
years to the New South Wales workers
and the progressive democrats, advo-
cates a Barton-Reid coalition. Dibbs,
he would sweep into the Agency-General;
to Parkes, he would offer a retiring douceur
of £lO,OOO. And what for the O’Sul-
livan? What new guinea-dropping Commis-
sion is he to bestraddle, this melodious dingo of
the general press ? He is discreetly silent on
that point. Fatuously enough he points to
coalition governments as having “ dragged out
of their difficulties ” Victoria, Queensland and
Maoriland ! Since when has Victoria been out
of its difficulties ? Shade of the Gillies-
Deakin boomsters ! Even the tolerably re-
spectable Berry-Service Coalition only kept
out the bailiffs, as it were, by discounting
post-obits, and it gave birth to the
infamous Gillies - Deakin boomers, that
shredded out into the Munro contemptibility
and the Shiels bladder-of-broken-promise. As
to Queensland —one would have thought that
an avowed democrat like O’Sullivan would
not have dared to bow down and worship the
Leper Twins who have sold that province into
the slavery of the Shindykit, and bound it
hand and foot with the cords of capitalism.
No one should know better than this terolite
from the workers that a coalition of Tories
from both sides of the Assembly means the
triumph of the Employers’ Association, and the
absolute downing and drugging of Labour.
“When the Empty Belly Votes.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
John Burns reminds his readers, in the Nineteenth Cen-
tury, that the world moves on its belly when empty
bellies have votes.—Cable.
The world moves on its belly when the empty
belly votes,
And curses rise to Heaven from a million angry
throats ;
Though “intellect ” and “culture” be a nation’s
joy and pride,
The clown who needs a meal craves for but little
else beside.
Then feed the starving masses, find employment
for the crowd
Whose shrunken fists are shaken at the wealthy
and the proud ;
Preach this maxim to the loafers with silk linings
to their coats—
‘ The world moves on its belly when the empty
belly votes.”
While the cruel wheel of Commerce grindeth
wages down so fine,
While the outcasts herd in alleys where the sun
can never shine,
The parson in his pulpit may see all things work
for good,
But the Devil leads the hungry to the battle-cry
of “ Food ! ”
Awake! old Merry England, to the everlasting
truth
That reckless wolves in winter have no after*
thought of ruth.
The few are heaping riches, and the many beg for
groats,
And the world moves on its belly when the empty
belly votes.

Wolfe’s Schnapps—avoid cheap imitations.
“ Federation ” will never be “ decided” until
time and circumstance all over Australia settle
the question by natural process; the “elec-
toral policy ” of a coalition that could afford to
spit on any third Labour-party—even if that
party were united—would never include a
battle to the death with the noxious Upper
House on the question of pure Manhood Suf-
frage local government” is bound to come,
anyhow, and can be much better shaped by
democratic than by monopolistic hands ; the
“mining upon-private-property” legislation of a
coalition oligarchy would be on similar lines to the
Kan akaland measure; the ne w “ Land Bill ” would
be a bill for the encouragement of land-grabbers ;
and the “ labour reforms ” attempted would be
in the direction of the statutory legalisation of
“ freedom of contract,” the indentation of
‘ ‘ cheap and reliable ” labour, the renewal of
assisted pauper immigration, a State-sweaters’
Indemnity Bill, and a Twelve-hours’ Labour
Act. All of these probabilities the O’Sullivan
should know.
The Absentee Baronet’s Christnias-Bush.
Last week, at Sydney Water Police Court, two
decent young fellows were fined 10s. each,
besides £1 damages, or, in default, 21 days’
tfdol, for “ stealing” some Ohristmas-bush from
Sir Daniel Cooper’s Bellevue estate—a huge
linfenced atea of suburban- land, looted by the
land-grabber in years gone by, and made of
enormous value by the subsequent presence and
labour and settlement of many thousands of
inert, Of whom the two accused are types. The
Absentee knight, who has his suction laid on
froth Australia to England, and condescends to
fatten at this continent’s expense without even
returning the compliment of ordure, who lies
by in languid idleness waiting for his properties
to boom in value without any industrial effort
on his part—to secure which end he is ready to
shut out those properties from any public use
whatever until his own fancy price is reached—
can, per medium of a hireling, cause honest
men of the community to spend their Christ-
mas and New Year season in prison for the
gathering of a little greenery to decorate their
commonplace homes ! The Bellevue hireling
urged, and Magistrate Brooks has upheld his
contention at law, that the mere posting-up of
notices warning off trespassers is sufficient to
prohibit persons from setting foot on unfenced
ground—a decision tentamount to a ruling that
ft notice-board here and there is legally a verit-
able fence. Presumably, the exact boundary
of such private property is to be known by
clairvoyant instinct. This hireling estimated
that the damage done to bushes (which it was
not deemed worth while to protect by fencing)
amounted to £l, and his statement was accepted
by the Magistrate. Instead of there being a
righteous law to punish Sir Daniel Cooper for
not improving nor using his land, for not
fencing around it, and for locking it up by mere
proclamation against any public or profitable
use, this fiercely democratic country permits
two of its citizens to be fined, with a prison
alternative, for seeking to brighten up their
all-the-year dinginess with a few green sprays
plucked from indigenous, naturally - planted
trees growing unprotectedly on an open
area ! Perhaps a democratic Parliament
may, some day, smoke out the absentee land-
lords. Meanwhile, the Government-by-Con-
tradiction farce continues.
Dear Bulletin,— New South Wales Assembly
has resolved by a large majority that a Bill
ought to be introduced prohibiting the employ-
ment of women as barmaids. The reason
assigned is that the men who visit bars—and
most men do, more or less—habitually break the
law by the use of foul language and in various
other ways, and that a public-house bar is a
place where a woman can’t hang out without
risking the destruction of her morals and the
loss of her immortal soul. This decision sug-
gests quite a lot of questions. If a bar is a
place of so loathsome a kind that no woman can
be employed there without her character going
to ruin, why doesn’t the law remove the bar
instead of removing the woman? When there
is a putrefying carcase in a public place, alid
the choice lies between removing the object or
removing the adjacent inhabitants to prevent
their being poisoned, the law generally
shovels away the animal, but in this case
it proposes to reverse the process. Further,
if man is such an offensive animal that he
has to chain woman up lest she should hear
him and be demoralised thereby, then isn’t it
rather a humorous condition of things that he,
the beastly object aforesaid, should pass laws
for preserving female purity, and “ raising the
age of consent,” and things like that? This
sounds like the carcase aforesaid passing regu-
lations for the maintenance of the public health.
Thirdly, how is the deposed barmaid to make a
living ? As a rule she knows nothing of any
other business, and Jawbone Neild can’t adopt
her as a daughter without ruining his reputa-
tion, and, therefore, it would seem that the
N.S.W. Assembly simply proposes to bounce
her into the streets out of a profound yearning
for her welfare, and leave her there. Is it pro-
posed that she should marry a Chinaman—or
what ? Fourthly, if a woman can’t listen to
the kind of observations men make in public-
houses without moral destruction, isn’t it time
that a law was passed abolishing marriage, for
however bad it may be to listen to an able-
bodied male citizen swearing in a pub. for, per-
haps, an hour at a stretch, the idea of marrying
that same individual, and hearing his language
continuously for perhaps half a century right
ahead, is infinitely worse ? Also, on the same
principle, shouldn’t men be abolished alto-
gether?—Yours truly, Titus Salt.

There seems to be an impression that
Bismarck, so adroit in .the past, has sunk
into a dotage of querulous and impotent com-
plaint. The Sydney Morning Herald actually
showed itsfelf so deeply imbued with this idea,
that, following the lead of the London press, it
published, the other day, an article lamenting
in a contemptuous fashion the imbecility of
Bismarck’s recent proceedings. The German
newspapers are more or less under the control
of the censor, and those which are influenced
by the great ex-Chancellor are not likely, in
any case, to expose his hand prematurely. But
the French journals are not similarly restrained,
and they hint plainly enough that Bismarck,
having brought about the unification of Ger-
many to the immense aggrandisement of the
House of Brandenberg, only to find himself
thrust aside and affronted by the ingratitude
and conceit of the present head of that
House—the Emperor William— is labour-
ing to upset the Prussian supremacy. The
Hohenzollerns are mere parvenus among
crowned heads, and possess no inde-
feasible right to the Imperial throne among
the sovereigns of the German States. It is
alleged that Bismarck is intriguing to set up
the claims of the King of Saxony—a much older
royalty than the Prussian—against the latter.
Bismarck recently went so far as to declare
that if the German supremacy was to be main-
tained, a national policy must be adopted, and
not a dynastic policy. That is to say that the
Emperor belonged to Germany and not Germany
to the Emperor. Or, in other words, that the
imperial throne should be allotted to the
sovereign best suited for it, without respect for
hereditary succession. This is the French view
of the situation. It is just possible that it may
be correct. But it is scarcely probable. An
internal convulsion, such as would ensue were
there rival claims to the Imperial office set up,
would split German unity into splinters, and
reduce Germany to the condition of impotence
in which Napoleon found her when lie foolishly
welded her hundreds of independent sovereign
princeletdoms, incapable of united action, into
a dozen or so, which subsequently combined
against himself, and 60 years later smashed his
nephew Napoleon 111, and under Bismarck’s
management consolidated into an empire, pretty
closely knit together.
Poor old He Lesseps should have died year 8
ago. It seems a pity that he should have
on living only to be prosecuted for fraud in hi 8
old age. The famous engineer has been a plea-
sant sort of man, and a special pet of the
Parisians, and, in fact, of all Frenchmen. He
has come to grief in the most natural way pos-
sible. His reputation as an inter-oceanic canal
engineer has been a lot too big for him. The
construction of the Suez Canal raised him to an
eminence in the engineering world to which his
actual professional abilities never entitled him.
It has been usual to rank the Suez Canal as one
of the wonders of the world. So it is, in con-
sequence of the vast influence it has exerted
on maritime traffic between Europe and the
East. But when people pretended that it
is a marvel of engineering science they
were confusing things. It is a big job,
but not a job which demanded exceptional
engineering skill or genius. The idea was the
main thing. But not only the idea but the
execution of it were realised thousands of years
ago. The great Napoleon was struck by the
traces of the ancient canal, and seriously re-
volved the scheme of restoring it. Every
Frenchman knew that. De Lesseps was just a
promoter. Once the late Napoleon’s co-opera-
tion was assured and arrangements fixed with
Ismail Pacha for an unbounded supply of
fellah labour—practically unpaid —the engineer-
ing troubles were trifling. The main thing was
to manage so that the banks should not silt in.
The scoops and dredges and so forth provided
for the work were not designed by Les-
seps. He was supplied with heaps of
money and did the social part, while a
staff of practising engineers effected the actual
work. After all, the estimates put forward by
De Lesseps proved altogether insufficient, and
there had to be additional capital raised, easy
and straightforward as the job of canal-making
was. Probably nowhere in the whole world
could equal natural advantages for a work of
like magnitude and importance be found. But
the Panama Canal is a very different affair.
The engineering work there is just as difficult,
as varied, and as complicated, as that at Suez
was easy, uniform, and simple, De Lesseps
went all adrift in his estimates, as before, only
a lot worse, and with his company bankrupt
and his reputation and fame threatened with
liquidation, he had recourse to all sorts or queer
and desperate expedients to stave off collapse
all round. The law-courts in France will now
have to decide whether any of these expedients
were fraudulent and criminal.

Brisbane Telegraph, a parson-conducted organ
representing of course like all other narsnn

conducted organs, the greasy-trader interest:—
There has been a little piece of sickly sentimentality
over that Thirsk signalman, and it will bear a crop of
vicious fruit by and by. The plea of the signalman
amounts to nearly the same as the plea of a man charged
with an offence, and who pleads drunkenness. This
signalman escapes only because he told the stationmaster
that he was unfit for duty. But knowing what his duty
was, and that it might be difficult at a moment’s notice
to get a supply why did he disqualify himself by watch-
ing at a sick bed ? It is much easier to find a nurse than
to find a signalman.

At this gladsome season of peace and
goodwill, it is interesting to know that cat’s-meat
—which is really partially decayed horse—forms
the Xmas dinner of a great part of the population
of London. In the poverty-stricken districts of
London there is an immense trade in cat’s-meat,
but cats are practically non-existent—in fact,
there is nothing for a cat to live upon—and the
offal is really eaten by human beings, or beings
that are as human as their surroundings will
permit. They can’t always get it, but when they
do, they feel that a gleam of sunshine has come
across their lives, England is the richest land on
earth, bar one, and it sends out almost as many
missionaries as all the rest of the world combined.
Therefore, The Bulletin trusts that all England’s
starving sons and daughters may have got at least
one bit of cat’s-meat for their Xmas fare. It is
no use praying for impossibilities, and to ask for
anything beyond that piece of offal would be
going into the region of the miraculous.
Dear Bulletin, —A “ nut ” is a kind of
human being peculiar to Australia. It is com-
monly asserted that a nut never fights, and for
many years I Relieved this, but the other day my
old-established idea was broken up. There were
two of these bush louts lounging in the bar of a
back-blocks pub. They are nearly always to be
found in a pub., and they never stand or sit, but
always lounge. Presently a third nut arrived,
and they asked him to “shout.” He said, with
eighteen adjectives, most of them suggestive of
offal, that he wouldn’t. Then one of the others
stated, with only seven adjectives, that he
would. While the beer was being poured out
he asked Providence, in a casual sort of way, to
strike him blind. Just as he was lifting his liquor
his friend jostled him, broke the glass and spilt
the contents. He promptly asked the offender to
come out while he wiped his boots on his liver,
and as his friend merely laughed and licked some
spilled beer off his grimy claw he biffed him on
the ear. Then the other lout put his head down
and rushed at him, and all was confusion. If you
could imagine a horse with legs three yards long,
eight legs on each side, and 19 joints in each leg,
all mixed up with another horse of the same build
and description, and both horses squealing
Australian oaths in a cloud of dust, you would
have some faint idea of the scene. First a ragged
boot hit the ceiling. Then a shower of teeth and
human mea't flew across the landscape. Next a
long leg flew out of the whirlwind, and another
boot crashed through the counter, and the pair
fell on the floor in a heap. One of them had his
foot inextricably stuck in the other’s stomach,
and the other held in his hand all the skin off his
friend’s head above the ears. Then the third
nut helped Sam’s foot out of Tom’s stomach
and they all took another drink and left.—Yours,
&c., L.

CUTHBERT LEAR.
“Willow and Wattle.”
Mr. Robert Richardson, a native of Australia
and graduate of Sydney University, now resident
in Scotland, is the author of a volume of verses
entitled as above. He comes to his task (it is
evidently a task) equipped with a panoplied
experience in journalistic versification which em-
braces—as he proudly states in his preface-
hardy excursions into the poet’s corner of the
Sydney Echo, the Boys’ Own Paper, the
Girls’ ditto, Little Folks, the People’s
Friend, Good Words, and other eminently
respectable and harmless publications. Mr.
Richardson writes not a single line calculated to
bring the blush of shame to the cheek of the modest
young person, or to excite the heart to one throb
more intense than any to beobtained per medium of
an orgy on ginger-beer. He is proper, polite and
virtuous, and should achieve an excellent reputa-
tion with the best friends of the most correct “bud”
literature. He has, perhaps, a weak fondness for
the family name of Lorrain, which he works both
with and without the final aristocratic “ e.”
Moreover, his stock-riders are too good and pretty
for this rough and Australian world, and his
readers mostly feel a devout thankfulness for their
beatific translation to another and a better sphere
—which event, it is needless to say, invariably
takes place in the orthodox fashion beneath the
mellow gleam of the much-advertised Southern
Cross, “where the myrtles grow thick by the
bend of the creek and the shade of the she-oak is
cool.” Moat volumes of Australian poetry consist
of wattle and dab. Mr. Richardson’s Australian
subjects are comrnendably few. There is little,
very little, wattle—his volume is mainly dab, and
not bad dab at that. He is clean, correct, and
admirably commonplace. There is nothing in his
volume very good, neither is there anything (to
use a S.M. Herald phrase) exceeding reprehen-
sible. He is just the man for his audience. The
volume is admirably printed, and reflects no little
credit on the publishers.

816 Macquarie-street North, Sydney, Dec. 28, 1892.
My Dear Mooeabinda, —
I’ve been thinking that if people must have titles, a
wise Colonial office ought to add a substantial “ink’m” to
the dignity—just to keep up the society pressure of the
thing. For, regard it how you like, when m’lady gives a
“ garden-party ” in a thinly-disguised cow-paddock, and
her unpretentious portal is opened to the visitors by a
little sloppy servant, who wants to slink into the earth at
the sight of the company, and regards the opening of the
front door as a special chance to hide herself behind it
well, the whole thing is a burlesque. And yet it all
happens as so written in one titled Southern family, to
the infinite amusement of visitors from “ ’Ome.”
AVhich reminds me that people who go about in “ ker-
ridges ” ought to have some regard for the harmonious
whole. The other day a very smart turn-out—the horses
alone would have been cheap at 150 guineas—splashed up
to a Sydney fish-shop, and a solemn footman came in
with stately stride and announced that his lady was out-
side and would confer with the tradesman. Whereupon
the excited fish-purveyor wiped his hands on his hair and
fled to the vehicle, adding sixpence on to his Murray cod
as he went. But when he appeared, she leant gracefully
towards him and said in her haughty English mannah,
“Threepence worth of prawns !” That was all.
The veteran Sir Alfred Stephen conveyed Christmas
wishes to his friends in a very acceptable form this year.
He sent photographs of himself taken seated in a writing
position at his study-table—seasonable wishes being
printed on the cards over his signature. The day is over
when the stiff flower flourishing miraculously in a satin
shoe or an infant’s head popping out of a dahlia, were
considered artistic media for the conventionalities of the
season. The fad is to be original. A Sydney girl was
charmed by a big basket of roses with a motto in forget-
me-nots.
“M.E.J.” was prevailed upon to hand out the medals
to the prize-winning workers for Chicago, at Sydney Town
Hall, the other day. All the successful competitors
seemed to be there, and the clank of many medals
sounded like somebody counting spoons in the basement.
Indeed, there was a regular shower of guerdons—it
looked as if they had been ordered by the cwt. instead of
to meet individual cases. Judging by the way one lady
(in the art line) got hers they must have been laid in on
the seven-for-sixpence principle. A bustling member
came to her in a hurry one day, and, after admiring her
work said, impulsively: “You shall have a medal, my
dear—if there’s one over.” And as there happened to
be a brassy ornament to the good she got her medal, sure
enough!
Confusion reigned supreme at the prize-giving. No
attempt at order in the allotment of the medals was made
by the ladies’ committee, and the prize-winners were
frequently appealed to as to what they had got, and why
they had got it ? “Are you going to have a silver ora
bronze for lace-work, Miss Snooks?” a worried voice would
be heard enquiring from the stage (en parenthfese, all the
prizes were allotted weeks beforehand). Miss Snooks,
after considerable delay, would probably turn up in the
bronze pile, and, after much searching, the medal would
be run down and banded to poor Lady Jersey (who got
more and more fidgetty at every frequent hitch) to give
to Miss Snooks with a few appropriate remarks. And
among the committee the confusion was still worse. Two
people were mostly to blame for the muddle, I am told,
but neither would accept the responsibility. Mrs. Blank
declared to her circle that if only Mrs. Dash hadn’t
interfered, everything would have gone off swimmingly—
and Mrs. Dash said it would teach them a lesson to leave
it all £o her next time.
And, apropos of unhallmarked infants, somebody tells
me how a wicked old woman closed at least one eye of the
Law to at least one episode of her romantic calling.
Policeman X considered that she hadn’t satisfactorily
accounted for the sudden demise of one of her charges,
and called to investigate-but the lady was equal to the
occasion. “You’d better not make a fuss,” she said—
“ that child belonged to Sir Blank Blank and a court case
wouldn’t do you any good.” There was no “legal
enquiry.”
The woman-suffragists are always trying to make the
male half of humanity seem superfluous. At a recent
meeting of the Sydney league somebody urged the local
female to take up the silkworm, which was equal to a
husband as far as the paying of bills went—only she
didn’t put it that way. Australia, she said, was the best
country in the world for growing silk, and if the
women would only take it up energetically many of them
could easily become independent of their husbands,
fathers, and other male relations. There’s a dashing
statement for you ! But it’s rather an aggravating fact
that so strong was the feeling in some quarters on this
matter that a gentleman on the Richmond River had
expressed his willingness to put a large estate under
mulberry culture and let it out to women. Man always
mas a brute ! He ought to put obstacles in the way of
feminine independence instead of heading the revolt.
The man from Richmond and his mulberry bushes is as
disaffecting a factor as the father who holds a candle to
light his eloping daughter downstairs.
The latest endeavour to rescue some of the numerous
stray Sydney infants from an untimely end is a “home
for the reception of infants apart from their mothers ’’ —
Mrs. Grundy, the real child-murderess, doesn’t like to say
“Foundling Hospital.”
Save for the really charming weather, the first day of
the A.J.C. Summer meeting wasn’t very exhilarating.
The Members’ stand looked all the time as it generally
looks when its occupants are at lunch, and the woman
who had come hoping to hide away sartorial deficiency in
a whirling mob must have felt her position keenly.
Mrs. Burdekin led what dressing there was in an apricot-
coloured silky stuff with tiny lines of gold thread and
trimmed with apricot lace, tiny bonnet of black velvet
and jet, with jet and lace aigrette and rosettes, and sap-
green baby velvet. Miss Burdekin wore a neat suit of
white duck, with a pink necktie and white boots ; a wide
black hat trimmed with pink and black, very ineffectively
topping off a womanlike turn-out. Pretty Miss Maud
Roberts wore a taking dress of spring green silk mingled
in a clever way with black velvet, gimp and lace—
her black and green hat, however, being too en suite
to be exactly “the last word of fashion.” Mrs.
Macnamara, returned from a Continental flight, con-
trasted strawberry silk and sage-green velvet very effec-
tively ; her sister wore a white gown and chip hat covered
with white feathers. The rest of the view was crinkled
crepon threaded about with baby ribbon (Makin ribbon, a
wicked man called it), and the absence of sustained thrill
in the petticoats left time to notice a large piece of
wadding on the steps as if some poor woman had figura-
tively come to grief. Also the spectacle of a frisky society
matron having her shoe-strings tied by a platonic male
“shadow” seemed more astonishing through being the
only tableau within eye-shot.
Two Governors lent a V.R. (it means Vive la ROpublique
as well as Vivat Regina) halo to the A.J.C. meeting on
Boxing Day, Lord Jersey, with a red-and-white button-
holer—who clung to the Judge’s stand all day—and
Monsieur Laffon, the Governor of New Caledonia, who is
a gay bachelor and has a bachelor’s catch-as-catch-can
expression, I think. He is tall and has a waist and wears
side-whiskers and a clean shave, and all the New Cale-
donian belles are said to weave matrimonial snares for his
wary feet. He kept mostly on the Judge’s stand, too—
with a toothpick in his mouth.
A holiday crowd thronged the Members’ stand, but the
dresses were not ail as bright as buttons. A long damsel
in a Russian blouse of pinky stuff cut very skimpily in
the back skirts, and trimmed with lines of blue and
yellow ribbon, was on the topmost bough of style—but
rather produced the effect (at the back) as if she were
scudding before the wind, Mrs. Burdekin wore her first-
day dress with the addition of a mauve orchid in her
hand. Miss Burdekin added a pinky frock to the same
cavalier hat. Mrs. T. Williamson, in pink crossed wdth
black lace, brought her two daughters in white and pink
—the most habyishly-pretty combination in the world.
Miss M'Donagh wore cream, patterned with pink roses
and trimmed with rock-melon yellow crfipe, rustic hat
sprinkled with roses. The most amusing figure on the
Members’ stand was a little lady who had fitted herself
tightly in murky green satin. Surely she had a mirror—
and surely it told her that she looked just like a bottle.
One or two improvements have been made atßandwick,
where they are always adding or subtracting something,
until one quite believes the committee man who tells you
“ the Club don’t save a penny.” The improvements this
season run to fences in unexpected positions. And, talk-
ing about racing, reminds me that Bong Bong (pro-
nounced Rung Bung, but always thought of as Bong
Tong) races at Moss Vale—a very fashionable picnic fix-
ture—are to be held earlier than usual in January. Their
usual date happens to be the anniversary of the death of
the late Mr. Throsby, upon whose estate the meeting is
held.
The characters in “Bluebeard,” at Her Majesty’s, last
Saturday, were all dressed to suit Xmas weather-except
that their tights were rather warm, perhaps. Maggie
Moore, as the hero, had much of the radiant colour. In
the first act carubia-red tights with silver fringes round
the waist and a red silk cloak designed in silver. Violet
and gold for the second thrill; and black and yellow to
finish. Miss Napier, a tall and stony damsel who had to
bend to recline on Maggie’s manly chest, was principally
attired in pale-blue Turkish trousers veiled in gauze. I
suppose it’s another argument against female suffrage
that so very few women can look confident in trews.
When Fatima clung to Selim the effect was that of a
nervous bather clinging to a rock.
Martyn Hagan’s first costume of yellow and green was
calculated to please all shades of religious opinion, and
Bessie Rignold, as the Fairy Queen, was daintily dressed
ill white tulle with many stage jewels—her bat’s-wing
cloak of two colours being a new idea—like the em-
broidered tights of some of the chorus. Cupid wore
roses principally—a great deal more, though, than the
genuine article puts on, if we can believe his pictures, so
the lady has no reasonable grounds for complaint against
the management if she catches cold in the execution of
her beauty—l mean duty. A feature of the first night
was that none of the managerial people were visible in
front.
I notice this about the beauteous actor-man-he always
looks the part. If he is a villain at night, the mummer is
a villain all day so far as outward appearance goes—he
does the Block with a red flower in his coat, and leers
the girls from under his hat if he happens to be a bad
man of abducting propensities in the “ piece.” And if he
is a good young man he wears a straw hat and looks sky-
ward. Take Sass, for example. Sanctimoniousness has
been written all over his shaven visage since he took to
playing the priest in the “ English Rose.”
Another thing one notices about the he-actors they
alone seem to have the courage (or cheek, possibly) to
dress according to the thermometer. You meet an
ordinary civilian perspiring along in a serge suit and a
round hat, or at best a straw “sailor,” to keep his silly
noddle cool; and then you meet Mr. Buskin in white
cricketing coat and continuations over a silken shirt and
an effective sash—the cynosure of the Block. Everybody
gapes at the airy figure, of course. It’s such a novelty to
see a man dressed for comfort and coolness in Australia.
Baccarat is the clever game the Gaiety Co. brought to
Australia with them. One damsel, imported for pictorial
reasons, makes a little club of her private sitting-room
wherevershe goes, and fools go in to mash and remain to pay.
A well-known Sydney raven-haired Johnnie backed the
lady to the extent of £75 one evening, and I am told
that the smiling way in which she dropped the whole
amount was sublime. But I don’t see much courage in
that. What I want to know is—was the Johnnie smiling?
It’s in one sense a lucky thing that there’s a clause in
the deed of separation between a well-known actress and
her husband that neither of them is to sue for a divorce.
This pair must come to grief. Neither of them, it is
plain, believes in the most judicious form of theatrical
advertisement.
In “Much Ado about Nothing,” at the Criterion,
festively smartened up all over—the coloured lanterns in
the boxes are very pretty, and I like the new tiger-tinted
box-draperies—Mrs. Brough, among the ladies, has the
most to wear, though I never did much admire the
fashions of the “Virgin Queen’s” period. In the first
act a bright carubia-red satin with the front worked in
black and made with a voluminous train, huge puffed
sleeves of black velvet, red fan, and coronet of black jet.
Her second dress was a rather nerveless mixture of pale
eau-de-nil and pink. The last garment was an old English
pink satin with the angel sleeves lined with white,
pointed collar of white lace, and diamond ornaments.
Mrs. Brousrh’s show* of diamonds is w r ell wmrth envying.
But the men in “Much Ado” are as gay as gadflies.
Save Cates, who is doomed to black tights, which reduce
his shadowy shanks to mere ripples of ink against the
gorgeous scenic effects, everybody seems to have a
milliner for a tailor. Sass, in tons of steel-grey 7 satin, and
Titheradge in pale-grey and shell-pink, are too dressy for
words, and Mr. Brough (as Leonato) comes out in a per-
fectly paralysing zebra stripe. It’s interesting to see how
girly the dolly young man looks when he gets into a satin
doublet. One of these Shakesperean Johnnies-I won’t
single him out—looks so extremely lady-like in his ruffle
that he might be B eatrice from the waist up.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
The Late Barcroft H. Boake.
It is desired to raise by subscription among the
readers of The Bulletin enough money to place
a modest monument over the remains of Bancroft
H. Boake, the gifted young native-Australian
writer whose death by his own hand, some months
ago, at the age of 26, caused so much regret among
the wide circle which had watched the opening of
what promised to be a brilliant and original
literary career. A melancholy interest will attach
to the graceful verses, “ Skeeta, an Old Servant’s
Story,” from the pen of deceased, which appeared,
for the first time, in the Christmas Number of The
Bulletin. We trust that the subscriptions will
come from over as wide an area as possible. The
proprietors of The Bulletin start the list with a
donation.
“ The Kanaka crew of the French recruit-
ing vessel Constantine murdered the captain and
mate, looted the vessel, and subsequently ate the
captain’s body.” Not much left.
Owing to the N.S. W. Post Office Xmas
arrangements, or disarrangements, our Melbourne
show notices, and many other expected items of
interest from various quarters, have failed to
come to hand.
A well-known genius, who “had to take
the first thing offered,” lately “accepted ’ the
editorship of a N.S. W. country newspaper. When
he got there he found he was expected to “ keep
an eye on” the stationery-shop attached to the
office. On his very first day, while writing a fierce
attack upon the present policy of Bismarck, he
heard somebody who wanted three-pen’north of
envelopes cry, Shop ! ” Leaving his trunk in
pawn, but bearing his professional dignity with
him, the poor pressman sadly returned to the
Beautiful Harbour per first train.
Mr. Justice Foster has resumed clutyin Syd-
ney after his return from Europe, whither he went
on a year’s sick-leave, for at least half of which
time he drew pay. Judge Foster’s case is a fair
example of the political-Judge system. He is a
conscientious, but slow and conspicuously weak
official and was never a prominent ornament to
the Bar. He didn’t ascend the Bench until he
was grey-headed, and it isn’t likely that he will
manage to do full work on the Supreme Court
bench very long. When he does retire from office
he will bo entitled to a pension of ,£lBOO a year!
The recent Salomons-Windeyer trouble,
and the fact that N.S.W. Chief Justice Darley
has expressed his gratitude to barrister Cullen,
“ who had paid the court the great compliment of
never repeating his argument,” reminds The
Bulletin that praise of the sort accorded by
the C.J. to the learned, well-meaning and lady-
like counsel referred to, is never likely to be
earned by any of the bull-pup advocates who
are and always will be the kings of the Bar. Even
in addressing the court, as distinguished from the
jury, emphasis upon emphasis, repetition upon
repetition, are the trump-cards of the strong advo-
cate--the great, big, broad-shouldered, broad-
browed, columnar-necked, thick-chested Martin,
or Aspinall, or Ireland, or Butler, or Salomons,
or Pilcher, or Purves—the Australian prototypes
of the O’Connells and Bussells and Cockburns
and Hawkinses of the British courts. The great
barrister —the successful convince!' alike of Benches
and of juries—sees and seizes the core of his
case, the keystone of the arch of his plead-
ing, and it is that and that alone which he pre-
sents. Not repeat his arguments ? The great and
successful barrister will shriek his main conten-
tion, howl it, chant it, sing it, thunder it, hiss it,
purr it, whisper it; he will dandle it, pound it
down on the table, jump on it, fling it at the jury,
bash it into the Judges’ faces, toss it up, catch it,
echo and re-echo it, split it into indivisible frag-
ments, englobe it as a whole and break up every-
thing with it; he will have it in his'exordium, in
the centre of his pleading, and in his peroration ;
he will exhibit it frontways, backways, sideways,
outside out and inside, out. In advocacy three
things are necessary—to make your central point,
to present it effectively, and to stick to it as a
bulldog sticks to a pig’s ear.
SUNDRY SHOWS.
SYDNEY SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Her Majesty’s “Blue Beard.”
Lyceum “ Little Reii Ruling Hood.
Garrick.’.’.’ “ Rink Dominoes."
Opera House Harry Rickards.
Carrington Grounds Fillis’ Circus.
York Street Rink Wirth’s Colossal Circus.
Coogeb Aquarium.
A huge desolation and the horror of a
great emptiness held possession of Sydney Garrick
on Saturday night. Death and his half-brother,
Decay, seemed to have hired all the front seats,
and sombre Melancholy was in possession of those
behind. “Blue Blood,” which constituted the
show, was evidently written to demonstrate the
grandeur of the man whose forefather came over
from Normandy with the Conqueror, and the innate
vulgarity, coarseness, and brutality of the man
whose father came over from Dublin in the steerage.
Mr. Tom Cannam, formerly of the Criterion Co.,
makes a reasonable success as a hard-working,
but bald and loathsome wholesale tailor—all the
characters are loathsome who didn’t come in with
the Conqueror—and is last seen being booted off
the premises by the principal aristocrat. This
latter part is admirably filled by Mr. Diver, whose
name isn’t nearly so familiar as it ought to be, con-
sidering how well he holds up a particularly
thankless character. Mr. Fred Norton, as another
aristocrat, requires only to be buried in oblivion,
somewhere where the gaunt arms of a barren
tree shake anathemas against a blood - red
sky, and so do all the rest of the com-
pany, barring only Mr. Stirling Whyte, who
is always commendable, Miss Flora Hastings,
and the snuffy old man with the portmanteau
that seems to be made out of mangy dogs crushed
flat. We are not absolutely certain about the
snuffy one, but we give him the benefit of the
doubt. It seems to be alleged that a piece called
“ Fink Dominoes ” is to bo put up next Saturday.

Sydney Lyceum opened its palatial doors
for the first time on Boxing Night. Williamson
and Musgrove are sole lessees, but there is an
aching void and a vacant chair in the middle of
that familiar signature where Garner’s autograph
rued to be, and that empty p!aco will never again
be filled. The Dycemn breaks the record up to
date in the matter of lavish upholstery. It is a
solid mass of magnificence made up of gilding,
plush, electric-lights, emblazoned roof, rich car-
pets, greenery, fairy lamps, dear old Goodman s
glad smile and shirt-front, curtains, miscellaneous
hangings, and all sorts and varieties of gor-
geousness. Every square inch of the building
has been decorated in some fashion or other,
and a winter garden, furnished with ferns,
1 junges and patches of cool shade, comes in handy
for accommodation in between the acts. On
Boxing Night every available seat and almost all
the available standing-room was occupied. The
big orchestra struck up the National Anathema
with a great blare and riot; and after this
solemn dedication the show commenced. “ Red
Riding Hood ” is partly pantomime and
partly burlesque, and is altogether beautiful,
in tlie spectacular sense, from one end to
the other. It is probably the most lavish
thing of its kind ever put on the stage in
Sydney. The scenic artists, G catcher and
Gordon, have used up several cwt. of paint,
and produced between them about two dozen
scenes of much aggregate loveliness, and the rest is
all song and dance and chorus and exceeding
great riot, after the approved Xmas fashion.
There are gloomy caves in it where green eyes
glare, and murky rifts of darkness, and places
where lawyers, wolves, and evil spirits organise
leprous devices, also there are cascades, bunyips,
demons, fairies, giraffes, monkeys, cats, maypole
dances, a grand march of assorted dolls, with a
band of gigantic and imbecile dolls in the van,
and a lot of black, gutta-percha, Zulu dolls in the
rear, a gorilla, a wicked baron, and several
hundred other features. The music-hall intona-
tion of Miss Alice Leamar, the leading lady,
isn’t so conspicuous as it was. Miss
Addio Conyers, Slade Murray, Bert Haslem,
and R. E." Watson are -all to the fore, and
the Gaiety Co.’s gaudy humorist, Courtneidge
—in female attire—is a weird and agile spinster of
that ancient variety whose eyes are red and sunken
and whose feet are honibie and cold. 'I he songs
are several degrees less imbecile than the usual
burlesque variety, and here and there an entirely
new joke uprears its head like a lonesome tree upon
the far horizon of literature.
* * *
Sydney Her Majesty’s led off the hot-
poker season with “ Bluebeard” (got up by Wal-
ton as Sir Henry Parkes, and showing how the
stuff, martyrs are made of would look in a Ger-
man shave) on Xmas Eve, and a cast of 31, with
attendant suites, did their level best to mitigate a
more-than-usually-brain-softening book. A few
people struggle gamely with the romance of the
Cerulean Potentate and keep him from being mis-
taken for a fancy ball. Maggie Moore’s Selim
makes the fun seem to begin every now and then,
but as that portly and potent attraction cannot
be always on the stage, there are intervals when
it strikes the spectator that it hasn’t begun at all.
Martyn Hagan, in various disguises ending in a
kilt, keeps a stiff upper lip, and little Ivy Scott,
as Cupid’s messenger, was by no means the small-
est star on the bill, altho’ cousin Lionel played
Sister Anne, who appeared as a “Coster donah’’ in
the last act, and whom the gods recognised in a
snap-shot as “Happy Mag.” Bessie Rignold’s
Queen Felicity was a sweet-voiced vision in
an airy garment and the Butterfly ballet
was a pretty notion. Also, what ought
to have been called the “Bandana ballet ” was a
cheerful circumstance, although its stage name
was probably “The Frolics of the Fairy Fays.”
The concluding Valentines, representing the
nativity of Rotomahana, ending with a Maori
coming out of a hot bath, are more reasonable
than the usual “ Haunt of Venus ” transformation.
Well-dressed and backed up by really artistic
scenery, “Bluebeard” only wants to have a new
Fatima in place of Miss Lily Napier (in whose
presence The Bulletin maintains a solemn silence
at a season when the Christmas pudding alone is
privileged to sit heavily on folks), a music-hall
song or two that Noah couldn’t whistle, a fair per-
centage of puns, and the murder of the author
announced in the bill to make Maggie Moore’s
concluding remark, “We want to know what it’s
all about,” less like a dreary echo from the front.

The Sydney public have plainly a great
yearning after minstrels, and Harry Rickards’
minstrels are evidently just the kind they are
yearning after. Therefore business at the Opera
House continues to be good, and when Rickards
sings his coster ditty the old building shakes to
the roof with the pent-up joy of the audience.
The Bulletin hereby announces that it is deadly
sick of costermongers. Why doesn’t some one
produce the song of the Chinee vegetable man?

Fillis’ Circus, which has felt bad ever since
Premier Dibbs stopped the lion-show and thus
boycotted and intimidated a downtrodden female,
has now organised a water pantomime to replace
the lost attraction. It is practically a damp bur-
lesque in a tank. The arena is filled with some
50,000 gallons of water, and after that the panto-
mime throws itself overboard and takes its chance.
Even the band is thrown overboard towards the
conclusion, and the wicked uncle has to swim
after the heroine, and the good spirit takes a
header and comes up shaking the water out of her
ears, and the dank hair of the policeman gets into
his mouth when he tries to assert himself, and the
organ-grinder is tipped backwards into the deep,
where the frogs get into his solo and the dank sea-
weed ruins his best top-note. The marine panto-
mime should be good for a long run. It isn’t
strong in the matter of scenery—the scenery is
mostly thrown overboard with the company and
thus doesn’t get a fair chance —but the tank looks
cool and refreshing, and the green waves sound
like music as they beat against the rocky shore—
we mean the tarpaulin.

“Much Ado About Nothing” was an
apropos play to re-open the revived-looking Sydney
Criterion theatre with on Boxing Night) There
have been rumours even unto the re-building of
the theatre, but the opening simply revealed com-
pleter lighting, alterations to circle -and boxes,
and a wealth of gilding everywhere ; and people
were not sorry to find the Cri. much the same as
of yore—like an old sweetheart in a new hat.
Amid the thirteen beautiful scenes in which the
management have enshrined Shakespeare’s little
thing the B. and B. Co. (who individually got a
reception on Monday night) flourish like green
bay trees. It must be a very soothing circum-
stance to be dressed to your finger-nails in a
rakish, sixteenth-century way with a mob looking
at you while you make all sorts of smart remarks
evolved by another man. A leading feature of
the show was that the author was spoken as
calmly as if he was an every day occurrence
at the theatre. Greenaway’s Borachio was the
only ranter, and he barn-stormed finely in front
of a drop cloth. Titheradge the Great’s Benedick
talked as if blank verse came naturally to him,
and the Elizabethian mouthings of plain Bill
Holloway's “ Ben ” seemed as if they never could
have been. Mrs. Brough as Beatrice was a good
deal like Beatrice as Mrs. Brough, and remem-
brances of Essie Jenyns raised a brisk crop of
critics in front where the frequent swoopings of
the familiar red plush curtain gave long pause
between the glimpses of scenery. There was more
interval than act at the premiere, and whether it
was the villainy of first-night sets or a permanent
reminiscence of Bernhardt the coming “to-nights”
and every evening will prove. But, barring the
eternity of waits, “Much Ado” is certainly a
lucid interval in a delirium of clowning. The
sobs of Cecil Ward (Claudio)—the most convincing
howler on the Australian stage—are alone suffi-
cient to secure the realism of the production.

Wirth’s Circus, at York-streeb (Sydney)
Rink, has been drawing big houses since Friday last.
There is a strong man arrived, whose name, by a
happy accident, is Kneebone, and whose feats of
strength are prodigious. An Italian named
Noveni shows everybody how easy it is to turn
somersaults on horseback, with the probable
result that Young Australia will rise in its thou-
sands and turn impossible Catherine-wheels and
go to borsepital with countless broken limbs. Mr.
H. Benharn is an English artist who piles half-a-
dozen chairs on the top of a lengthy flower-stand
and sits upon them and waves his legs and arms
about alarmingly. He is also the proud proprietor
of a performing pig, who does everything but
speak. He could do that if he liked, but he is
trained not to. Also, Bedouin Arabs come in
from the desert and hack at each other with
scimitars, and jump wildly about the arena, and
spin rifles in each hand, and generally show
that the Soudan contingent did a wise thing whin
they started for home. The quadrilles on horse-
back are very well done, and the double statue
act, “illustrated,” as the play-hills have it, by
Mr. G. Wirtli, Mr. Montgomery, and the Misses
Marizles and Madeline Wirth, is decidedly
graceful. Miss Marizles is an accomplished horse-
woman, who jumps backward through numerous
balloons, whilst Miss Edith Wirth calmly hops
through hoops of fire without hurting herself or
turning a hair. Altogether the show is a very-
good one and ought to draw big houses through
the season. The only thing that worries the pro-
prietors is that Government doesn’t see its way to
giving them any advertisement.

The Melba divorce suit (writes a Bulletin" correspondent
from London) is at an end. The sprig of French royalty
who caused the trouble has taken upon himse.f a couple
of years’ exile iu Africa with an exploring party, and a
formal separation between Madame and her hubby, the
(iery Charley Armstrong, is legally arranged. The latter
celebrated the event last week by going a-hunting in
Hampshire and breaking an arm. Madame and he never
speak now as they pass by, but none the less she is in
great form at the Opera House, and this week adds Aida
and Desdemona to her repertoire.
Miss Pauline Joran, who “ played the fiddle like an
angel ” when touring with her sisters through Australia,
six years ago, has developed a lovely voice, figure, and
features, and is now one of the attractions in the Carl
Rosa Opera Co. She appears before a London audience
shortly.

Pattie Browne, according to the cable, “denies a
report, circulated in some of the English theatrical
organs, that she has been married.” Which must be
Pattie’s delicate way of explaining that she is neither
wife nor widow, and will gladly receive tenders.
A huge alligator is now on view in Brisbane. As it has
a most lachrymose expression and a fondness for snapping

About twelve years ago a large foundry was in full
swing at the rear of the Victoria Theatre, Newcastle
(N.S.W.). An ingenious apprentice constructed a tunnel
from the foundry yard into the theatre. It ended in a
corner under the stage. By this means the youngsters
were long enabled to surreptitiously effect their entrance
into the body of the theatre. The tunnel was worked by
a syndicate of apprentices, who charged a fee for admis-
sion to its ranks. They also enacted a fearful oath of
secresy from every new member. A thoughtless member
of a comic turn, however, gave the whole thing away by
popping up dirty and grimy through a trap-door during a
melodramatic love-scene. He asked the lover to pull
down his vest, and then decamped. Investigation led to
the discovery of the tunnel.
Montgomery and Miss Cleveland will be remembered
favourably as Benedick and Beatrice, also Barry Sullivan
and Mrs. Heir, whose brother, Calhcart, appears in the
Sydney production. Somehow, none of the Dogberries
have quite struck this character, from Rogers and
Lambert down to Anson and Harwood, but a professional
saying is that the best Dogberry was H. H. Davies,
drowned in being ferried aCross a N.S.W. river.
The curtain at Wellington (M.L.) Opera House is let
out as an advertising sheet, and is decorated all over
with notices about coal, and false teeth, and soap, and
furniture on the instalment plan, and the like. Also, by
a clause in the contracts, this garish horror has to be
lowered after every act under pain of legal proceedings.
The audience hisses every time the destructive object
appears. Presently it will begin to throw things.

An examination paper in music, set by Marshall Hall,
consisted of the following:—l. Distinguish between the
sublime and the beautiful. 2. State what theories have
been promulgated in support of your views.
Marshall Hall, the musical cultchavv man, conducted a
Melbourne orchestra last week in a quite satisfactory
manner. But the praise lavished upon this feat wasn’t as
complimentary to the Professor as his admirers seemed to
imagine. It was really an outbreak of astonishment at a
talker of florid twaddle being able to do anything
rational.
A Maoriland country audience being small and un-
appreciative of the Snazelle, that fiery warrior publicly
contrasted them with “ Little Woodville,” the hated rival
township. Result, a howling notice, the local paper
telling Snazelle that he was no gentleman, and that if he
valued his skin he had better not outrage the citizens of
Pahiatua by showing himself among them again. There
was also a pathetic appeal to the local constable to “ take
the colossal conceit out of this boaster” by prosecuting
him for charging at Sunday The peeler—who,
with his whole family, had “ dead-headed ” the show—
responded patriotically and issued a summons.
A story by Snazelle: “In India the army officers and
the parson are ‘ hail fellows well met,’ and the custom is
for the officers to place their cards in the collection-plate
with the amount they intend to give written on the card,
and the parson’s servant collects the money next day.
One Sunday morning the Rev. Luke Saunders had been
preaching a long sermon on charity, and in conclusion he
said: ‘My dear brethren, I wish to inform you that this
collection-plate goes round for money or the equivalent
thereof, and I want to see more money in the plate and
less cards with ‘ Saunders, old cock, how are you ?’
written on them.’ ”
George Adams, of Sydney “Tattersall ” fame, will have
to take £5OO a week over the counter of his palatial bar
to pay interest on the investment. An expensive ad.
A N.S.W. Cabinet Minister (Mr. Suttor), accompanied

formance was at once interdicted.
A Victorian wine-firm advertises itself with this fiery
ditty in Melb. Princess’ pantomime book :
Boucicault’s last speech, in Melbourne, was querulous,
lie evidently didn’t take Brough's view, and exonerate
the public. Nor did he weep, like Cob—nary weep about
Boucy.
Brough, in his farewell Melbourne address, made a
feeling- remark on the medical skill which saved his life,
at the time when the preparations of the “School for
Scandal” broke him down.
Wild horses couldn’t drag from us the assertion that
Tom Appleby (though a good fellow) was a good actor ;
however, hosts of people are sorry to read of Ids demise.
He was five years manager of the South Shields theatre.
Parkes came from London to Melbourne in the same
steamer with the Boccaccio troupe, and actually wrote a
poem on Appleby—who nevertheless survived for years.
He had only one style, a kind of Jack on wires, or living
marionette.
Misfortune seems to wait upon George Darrell when he
ventures abroad. His first professional visit to England
resulted in a severe wound and a consequentl3’-broken
engagement, and now, at Johannesburg, George has
buried his young wife. Christine Darrell will be remem-
bered as a well-meaning actress, whose natural ability
was hidden by hyper-stagey mannerisms and a painful
desire to assert herself. George used to say that he had
moulded her to his will, but the will of that indomitable
attitudinist is not the best of dramatic influences. Chris-
tine was a faithful, admiring little wife to her hero, all the
same, and George has The Bulletin’s sympathy (injhis
very sad domestic affliction.
Madame Scharazade, whose performance in the lions’
cage at Fillis’ Circus was stopped by Premier Dibbs, is in
receipt of £3O a week under agreement for a term. She
cannot now perform in N.S.W., but will get her money
allee same. Her husband’s lion-cage performance is also
proscribed ; nathless, he draws his £l5 a week.
Gov. Hopetoun was at the “ Alick ” in Melbourne one
night during the Dampier regime. In an interval between
the acts Alfred came round in front, and, leaning over the
dress-circle railing, looked up to the gallery, saying:
“Now, boys, three cheers for his Excellency. Hip, hip,
hooray.” But they weren’t having any just then, so
Alfred retired, a loyal oasis in a desert of democratic
derision. (N.B.—This story isn’t true.)
“ Drama (1) The piece was never played at Sydney
Garrick ; (2) Mr. Bentley never took the part in Sydney.
The Parson Patronage Boom is being tried for all it’s
worth. At Hobart, for instance, they invite people to
come and see “ The Parson’s Oath,” on the ground that it
was written by the late Spurgeon.
Men with iron heads are now wanted badly in London
for the show business. When it conies to wooden heads
lots of people will have a chance.
A well-advertised Melbourne man is promoting a concert
for which he has advertised for musicians. Those who
applied found that they were expected to attend four
rehearsals and the concert for one pound.
Isaac Rofl(Melb.) left nearly £3o,ooo—all made by bill-
sticking.
Helen Fauoit was late at rehearsal once, and being
reproved therefor by Macready, said ; “ Well, it’s the first
time, and I thought you allowed ten minutes grace.” To
which the tragedian: “We don’t allow you any grace,
Miss Faucit. You have plenty of your own.”
B. & B. propose to play 18 pieces during their six
months stay in Sydney, including Pinero’s “Times,”
Barrie’s “ Walker, London,” and Jerome’s “ New Lamps
for Old.”
Laurence Cautley — when will folks learn that Laurence
is the Christian, and Laivrence the surname ?—has
recovered.
George Rignold’s Christmas gift—a gold watch—was
won by a schoolmaster. This is the third win in succes-
sion for the tutorial trade.
When Wiegand plays his “ Idyll, dedicated to Monsieur
Alfred de Forestier,” the thunder is so real that rain
usually follows.
Marie Fraser has been eating hogs and drinking said
out of cocoanuts at a banquet given by the Apian natives
in honour of R. L. Stevenson’s birthday. By the way,
what has become of Stevenson’s artist son-in-law? He is
never mentioned, although his wife is at Samoa.
Yankee manager Frohmann doesn’t admit “ the per-
fesh ” to : flrst nights. He kindly states that the actor out of
work invariably delights to “crab” the chances of the
actor in work by his jeers.
The portrait of the thrice-elected Mayor Manning is
now sold (with that of organist Wiegand) in conjunction
with photographs of Sydney Town Hall and a description
of the organ. What has the man who turns over the
music done to lose a similar opportunity of achieving
immortality ? But the worst of the business isthatpeople
who go to the Town Hall to hear the music and don’t want
Manning’s picture are persistently tortured by the
solicitations of a book-huckster.
Letter received from a local dramatist by Walter Bent-
ley during his tour in Maoriland:—“Wellington, Novem-
ber 23, 1892. Dear Sir, —I hope you will exuse Me for
takeing the liberty of writeing this note to you but I have
wrote a drainer and would like to dispose of it if you
wish and let Me know I will send it to you so as you can
look over it I am just writeing to the paper to know if
there has ever been a drainer wrote before in New
Zealand.”
Amies Beaumont fingered a cheque for £350 last week,
the result of the testimonial concert to the “ veteran
tenor,” at Melbourne Town Hall.
A ground-shark, nine feet long, now disports in a tank
at Melbourne Aquarium. Other ground-sharks of smaller
sizes may occasionally be seen “on the tank” in the
same city.
It has been stated that “the owners of the Gaiety
Theatre,” cabled Lonnen, immediately after the death of
Fred Leslie, “to come to London for the Christmas
Season.” Apart from the fact that Lonnen’s engagement
for the Princess’s pantomime was well known at the
Gaietyq the question that naturally arises is—how in the
name of geography could he have got back for the Xmas
Season?
Plain Bill Holloway’s first appearance on the English
stage aroused the interest of all Anglo-Australians. Wil-
liam Archer, the scorching “W.A.” of the World, avers
that “Mr. Holloway made a manly and effective Kent.”
The only nasty notice was that of Clement Scott, of the
Telegraph, whose collaborateur is one Austin Brereton,
not unknown in Australian theatrical circles.
The Bulletin made a mistake in stating that Miss
Roland Watts-Phillips was a member of the Sydney
Garrick co. She ought to be, though. The company at
the Garrick would be considerably improved by her
presence.
Pollard makes a big thing of his “ Aladdin ” panto, a
Adelaide Royal. The scenery is specially painted, and
the youngsters had over a month’s rehearsals.
“Bob” Cunningham, of Melbourne, after a long Eng-
lish.season with the Carl Rosa Co., did a tour in the
tenor part in Cellier’s opera, “ The Sultan of Mocha,” and
was, when the mail left, awaiting another engagement.
His voice is much improved, and he is not so fat as for-
merly, having apparently sung himself into condition.
W. J. Holloway’s daughter Theodora, who has grown
divinely tall, made a promising debut on the stage
recently in a part in the comedy “The New Wing,” sent
out to the English provinces by Willy Edouin.
The first London engagement of Charles Harding, the
Australian tenor, has turned out disastrously for him.
After a fortnight’s trial, Sig nor La go closed the theatre,
and salaries are still owing. Harding made a creditable
show in “Maritana,” but was most villainously costumed
in clothes fifteen sizes too big for him.
Orange (N.S. W.) Leader formally ukases that no print-
ing will be done at its office for any showman without
spot cash. No payee ; no getee. Rule made absolute.
The Imperial Institute has obtained a music license.
Probably they think of tightening the silken bonds with
Chevalier’s coster melodies.
The most startling photos, on Melbourne Block are
those of Brough as the convict in “A Village Priest.”
Watch the faces of those boom-bankers still at large when
they catch sight of that closely-cropped head and ashen
face.
The death of Mrs. J. E. Kitts is announced.
The police at Liverpool (Eng.) recently took proceedings
against the licensee of a hall for permitting a musical show
on his premises on Sunday. Defendant explained that he
let (he place to a Jewish person for a religious entertain-
ment, whereupon two policemen climbed into the box
and solemnly swore that the entertainment wasn’t reli-
gious for they were there and heard “ Annie Rooney ”
sung in Hebrew.
Adelaide Theatre Royal to let for February. Wyhert
Reeve says it is “ one of the coolest theatres in the'colo-

Mummery v. Mummery—a Melb. divorce-case last week.
Another reflection on the “perfesh.”
Solange Navaro, well-remembered in Australia as the
French waiting-maid in “Jo,” is touring England under
her married name—Mrs. Maud Digby.
Somebody once whistled in encore for Creswick at Mel-
bourne Bijou. Creswick came out, angry :“ I don’t mind
applause, but I will not be whistled for like a dog 1”
“ Whenever an actor is filled with tradesman-like
anxiety to secure a maintenance for himself, his wife, and
children, there is an end of all improvement.”—
SCIILEOEL.
The Morning Journal on stage kissing: “ Margaret
Mather is a finished and gifted artiste in osculation. One
night in ‘Romeo and Juliet’ she bade Romeo farewell
and was turning from him. Suddenly she wheeled about
and clasped her lover’s face in her fair hands and looked
longingly into his eyes. The audience was spellbound ;
one could fairly feel the stillness. There was but one
thing in the whole theatre—a woman’s face leaning for-
ward towards the lips of a man. Then she kissed him.
Juliet raised her head and looking back at Romeo, glided
slowly away. There was an expression on her face which
one cannot begin to describe, nor can ever forget. The
play went on, but there was not the slightest attention
further given it. The kiss still occupied the mind of the
audience. One by one the people relaxed their strained
and intent attitudes, and leaned back to more comfort-
able positions. There was no noise, and silence reigned
until the curtain fell.”
Santley “ never knew a great singer who didn’t smoke.”
Woman, wine and song—and smoke.
Messrs. Troedel, Cooper and Co., 81 Clarence-street,
Sydney, send us some splendid samples of coloured litho-
graph pictorials executed by them for Pillis’ Circus.
Both in drawing and colouring these are fully equal to
the average of American lithographic art, and should be a
revelation to the managers who now import tons of
lithographic work, and are righteously charged a heavy
duty on same. Messrs. T., 0. & Co. have taken firsl
prizes at seven exhibitions—including London, Philadel
phia, and Calcutta, and the printing that is good enough
to take a high place in an American exhibition is good
enough for anywhere.
A Melbourne lady, of histrionic talent, is only baulked
by her nose.
The costumes of the auxiliaries in Williamson’s “ Forty
Thieves ” are from London, those of the principals are
Melbourne-made. Sorry there are no Melbourne-made
actors and actresses.
The noble husband of Connie Gilchrist is patron of 25
livings in the Church of England, and one of the loveliest
sights on earth is Connie enquiring into the principles of
mild-eyed curates who have come after a billet. On these
religious occasions the new peeress is said to sport a
golden crucifix set with diamonds, and an extra celestial
smile.
There is in Geelong Cemetery not far from the mortuary
chapel a, tombstone which is slowly toppling over. The
inscription reads:—“Erected to the memory of William
Nesbitt by his brother tragedian, G. V. Brooke, 185—.
Of Plain Bill Holloway’s performance in Irving’s pro-
duction of “King Lear” London Daily Telegraph : “A
more prosy' rendering of the Earl of Kent has seldom been
seen.” London Standard : “No little credit was due to
Mr. Holloway for his blunt honesty and manliness as
Kent.”
Boy-Politician Caulfield now manages a
Perth (W. A.) hotel.
Pall Mall Gazette “ very much fears
there is trouble ahead in Queensland.” The reason
is Sir Charles Lilley’a remark: “I am an Aus-
tralian first and an Englishman afterwards !”
Maorilanclers are beginning to inquire into
their charitable-aid system. One man, active, 40,
given to having a good time generally, but an
inmate of a “Refuge,” has just been elected an
officer of the local Masonic Lodge, and another
man receiving charitable aid serves as a “grand
juror,”
The stupidest mistake of the Victorian
Estimates was made in connection with the duty
on spirits. Berry closed his eyes to the fact that
<£loo,ooo worth of whisky had been cleared in
anticipation of the new tax, and forgot to reckon
that the big stocks on hand would have to be dis-
posed of before the Customs could begin to feel
the benefit of an extra three shillings a gallon.
An English paper cracks up Lord Charles
Scott for what he did out here as Admiral, espe-
cially in the way of laying the telegraph round the
Australian coast. The paper apparently doesn’t
know that his lordship discovered Sydney harbour
and established Melbourne Cup day; also, that
he modestly refused a unanimous request that he
should accept the Governor-Generalship of Fede-
rated Australasia.
It is complained in Sydney that an old
offender, recently sentenced to two months’ gaol
without the opticn of a fine, for running a totalis-
ator, was privately released by the authorities
after a few days’ imprisonment only. The moral
of this sort of thing, as The Bulletin has often
pointed out, is that when any offender, no matter
who, is about to have any part of his sentence re-
mitted on whatever pretext, notice to that effect
should be published in the Government Gazette
so that the press may tell the public.
Another Joy from the “ New Australia ”
land :
It is hard to think of a spider sufficiently bold to pur-
sue aggressively a man on horseback, but such is the
lycosa or wolf spider of the Argentine pampas, a great,
crah-hke, light-grey creature, as hideous as it is ferocicus.
The bite of the big horny spider which takes to roaming
in Autumn is a serious matter. In the case of the hairy
spider, I do not think any creature, however stupid, could
mistake its meaning when it stands suddenly up, a figure
horribly grotesque ; then, dropping on all eights, charges
violently forward. Their long, shiny, black, sickle-shaped
falaes are dangerous weapons. I knew a native woman
who had been bitten on the leg, and who, after 14 years,
still suffered at intervals acute pains in the limb. The
gauchos sing a ballad about an attack on the city of
Cordova by an array of monstar spiders. The towns-
people marched out, but after a few volleys broke and ra u
for their lives.
Dear Bulletin, —The world generally,
and every section of it in detail, is being con-
tinually drenched with Drink Statistics. How is
it we never get any Non-alcoholic Statistics l .
Surely all the coroners are not such drunkards
that they can only afford the last advertisement
of woe to men who suicide as a side-show to
Drink ? It is a graceful and a brotherly tribute,
no doubt, to a departed brother, to give him a
Bacchanalian certificate of merit; but is there
not one teetotal Coroner—or, at least, a teetotal
Coroner’s orderly—who will perform the last sad
offices of advertisement for the felo-de-ses of
Abstinence? Also, among the “found-deads,”
the “ fell-in-a-fits,” the “ killed-in-a-fights.” let
us, oh! let us have the teetotallers enscrolled.
They say that only 20 per cent, of proved
murderers are drunkards. Can this be? By the
way, now that I come to ponder over this—did
you—did anyone—ever know, or ever know any-
body else who said he knew, a Teetotal Coroner ?
— The D.
G. H. Reid, after moving his want of
confidence resolution in N.S.W." Assembly, com-
plained that members throughout the debate had
called upon him to state his policy—he was always
under the impression that it was for Ministers,
not for their opponents, to show a policy. This is
the sort of argument that a miserable police-court
attorney might employ in defending a thief before
the beaks. Reid went on to plead that he could
not be expected to show a policy until he had
consulted with his political friends—meaning
thereby, of course, that after putting out Dibbs
and getting his billet he was going to hunt round
for the most expedient thing to do in order to
catch votes. “I am not,” he, thus said in effect,
“ a strong man with a policy in which I believe
with all my heart and soul, for which I am pre-
pared to fight to the death, and which I am pre-
pared to make any men who join me adopt—
failing which I shall scorn to take office. No,
like the other fellow, I am only a political trick-
ster, and I want to jump the claim of the fellows
in office.” A lot of the Labour members who
might otherwise have joined him saw this, and he
lost their votes. It certainly cost him the sup-
port, among others, of Rae and Williams.

A draught of the wine that was raised on the soil,
From the fruit of the vine in the land where ye toil;
To the gold in the mine, and the corn and the oil
We will drink in the wine of Australia!

Carruthers says that Parkes doesn’t want

Parkes wants, or rather needs, office very badly
just now.
With Victoria, the dynasty of the Guelphs,
in its English branch at least, ceases ; the Prince

Parkes (at a drummers’ dinner): “It is

Mr. J. E. Gladstone, a veteran school-

The most magnificent new Melbourne

When you know all about Judge Windeyer

Clark Russell, the sea-writer, first went as

Disgustus M. Moore, lately editor of Lon-

Editor Bulletin, —
As to a paragraph in a
recent issue, asser*.ng
that there is a danger of
the Dickens family
dying out, “as with all
geniuses,” I send you
herewith a picture of
seven of his grand-
children, offspring of my
brother -in - iaw, Henry
Fielding Dickens, Q.C.
Besides these substantial
per po t u at ions of the
Dickens line, the oldest
son, Mr. Charles Dickens,
has, I believe, seven
trirls and a boy. Add to
these, two children of
Alfred Dickens, now in
Australia, ac-
count for seventeen direct
descendants of the great
novelist. Had the writer
of the paragraph in ques-
tion had to bear the ex-
pense of providing them
with boots, clothes and
education, he would pro-
bably have remained
mournfully silent. Far
from the family dying
out, I am inclined to
think it is increasing
with too great rapidity,
as the picture of my
seven little nephews and
nieces, children of my

will only too well testify.

A gentleman, who observed that the word

The proposed duel between the Radical

Ex-Superintendent Winch,.of the Victorian,

iSo it happens the G.O.M. is frequently treated

another of the same journal. The Argus is con-
vinced that politics is Gladstone’s weak point. A
ifew years ago it would have believed Newton to
bo at his best in theology, and Goethe sublime on
the chromatic scale but an ass at poetry and philo-
sophy.
The Kingston-Chaffey Baker duel fiasco
reminds one of the Gorger-Grliber incident of
some years ago. Ginger was a well-known
Adelaide medico who has since retired on a Broken
Hill fortune and is now “home” in happy Ger-
many. Gruber is the Acting-Consul for Belgium,
and the two quarrelled about something—pro-
1, tiily about the diaeresis in their respective,
n unes. The doctor, who was warlike in tone and
carried a scar on his face, promptly challenged
({rliber, who held a commission in the local army.
r j he latter did not want to be ridiculous .and so he
b inded the correspondence over for publication.
There wasino coffee and pistols, only a burst of
indignation from the press and a roar of laughter
from the good people of Adelaide.
Lord Tennyson —poorest of peers, richest
of poets —died worth ,£57,000 :
According to Blackwood, “ R. L. Steven-
son trailed his genius in the dust in ‘ A Wrong
Box ’ for the advantage of a neophyte in whom a
foolish fondness of regard has apparently induced
him to suppose certain qualities which the clearer-
seeing reader perceives only as defects. Ihe same
neophyte appears in the Wrecker, enfolded,
wrapped up, attempted to be concealed in the
genius of his companion.” Now, we don’t know
what share the neophyte, Stevenson’s step-son—a
very cubby young man named Osborne, who makes
cigarettes for his ma and type-writes for his pa-
had in writing the “Wrecker,” but his share in
“ A Wrong Box” chiefly consisted in the afore-
mentioned 5 ’type-writing and the placing of his
name on the cover in order to secure by that
device he being an American citizen—the advant-
age of copyright in the States. Blackwood,
however, gets some fun out of the neophyte by
putting down all Stevenson’s “ slop work to
him.
Nothing in modern times has been so copied as
Wolfe’s Schnapps. Beware of imitations.

1ST STREET ARAB: "Say, Bill, wot's that V R on Black Mariar for?"
2ND DITTO: “It’s for Vagabond’s Removed. "
Michael Monaghan, a youth remanded for
sentence on a charge of robbery with violence, had
his case reported by Melbourne Herald under
the heading, “A Candidate for the Triangles.”
Another instance of the “respectability ’ of the
daily press. Here was the miserable little Ebald
disturbing the solemn consideration of the Court
with the shriek of “ Let Michael be flogged !
A shipwreck is a frightful experience. To
hear the wind whistle, the timbers creak and crash,
the cordage strain, the sailors swear, and the
women scream, tremble, and run hither and
thither like maniacs is enough to appal the
bravest heart. Yet with all its terrors death by
shipwreck is not half so terrible as the slow and
insidious course of disease which for the latter
years of the stricken one’s life makes existence a
misery, not only to the victim but to all around
him. With such terrible facts staring us in the
face, how careful we should be to pn serve that
blessing of Providence, health and strength.
Note should be taken of the first signs of disease.
A simple headache is an infallible sign that the
liver and stomach are disordered ; frequent tooth-
ache and neuralgia indicate infallibly that tbe
nervous system is becoming enervated ; that tired
feeling is proof positive that strength is failing.
There are hundreds of such symptoms which should
have immediate treatment. Clements Tonic
fortifies the blood, and builds up nerve tissue; it
is the greatest regulator of the system ever intro-
duced, and thousands of grateful sufferers testify
to this fact. For instance, Captain P. Connelly,
20 Elliott-street, Balmain, Sydney, New South
Wales, who writes “ Three mouths ago my
wife, 55 years of age, was confined to her bed,
unable to move. I called in Dr. ■, of
Balmain, who pronounced the case as hopeless,
and beyond all human skill, it being a general
breaking-up of the system. He further told me
she was in a high state of fever (what kind he did
not state). Her temperature was 105. She was
quite unconscious, and apparently not far from her
end. She remained under his treatment for about
10 days, during which time she took the medicine
he prescribed without the least improvement. On
Ids third visit he again pronounced the case as
hopeless, and told me to give no medicine, but
plenty of nourishment, and if I liked I could call
in another medical man. I could see my wife
rapidly sinking, and having heard of Clements
Tonic, I determined to try it. I purchased a
bottle from Mr. , chemist, of Balmain.
When the doctor had paid his fourth visit I had
given her three doses, and noticed a decided
improvement. When the doctor saw my wife he
told me that, wonderful to say, she was better,
and he repeated his former statement, and told
me not to be astonished if she died at any moment.
I told him what I had been giving her, and he
said it was no use giving it. I persevered with
Clements Tonic, and the fourth large bottle com-
pletely restored her to health. She is now able to
go about as well as ever, and do her own house-
work ; in fact, she lias since attended to her
daughter and niece through their confinements,
and nursed a friend through typhoid fever. I feel
so thankful to you for your Clements Tonic that I
should be acting ungratefully if I did not acknow-
ledge the wonderful cure your Clements Tonic
has made. I may say that in every case I advise
people to try it it has had the same effect. lam
well known in Balmain, holding as 1 do several
medals from the Royal Humane Society for saving
life. Anyone wishing to see me personally and
ask me about Clements Tonic can always find me
at the above address.—l remain, yours faithfully,
Ca.pt. P. Connelly, 20 Elliott street, Balmain,
N.S.W.
His anthems soared to Heaven’s far concave,
The poles his aisle, th’ ecliptic plane his nave ;
He tested others by the Flame of Worth—
He swooned in Heaven but he grubbed on earth.
He pierced the Future’s womb, and ripped the veil
Untimely from the unaccomplished tale ;
Threw bull’s-eyes on the radiant Future's brow,
But took good care to mammonise the Now.
In poesy ohivalric, spurning gold.
In lofty measures he serenely told
How deeds of pure self-sacrifice are done—
And kept his weather-eye on No. 1.
A golden lyre all draggled out of chord ;
He wrecked a poet when he turned a lord.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The missing word : Republicanism.
Apparently, says the Age, Sir Henry
Parkes believes that Freetrade is a lost cause in
Australia.
Under the proposed Victorian bill, the
Agent-General will rank as an absentee and be
taxed accordingly.
Ten members of the present N.S.W.
Legislative Assembly are engaged in “Sussex-
street accountancy.”
“ The Freetrade party in Victoria regrets
that Sir Henry Parkes did not go far enough.”
As if Parkes can go far enough—and live.
The time has arrived for testing the oft-
repeated statement that nothing will induce the
Shiels Government to prosecute Matthew Davies.
J. R. Dickson, land-boom auctioneer of
Brisbane (Q. ), is to be the leader of anew Kanaka-
land _ democratic party ! As well appoint a dingo
to mind sheep.
The story goes that the N.S.W. Ministry
lias in its possession a photograph of a certain
£5OO cheque, and finds the picture a most useful
and valuable article.
Gladstone seems to have set a desirable
fashion of stopping away from the Lord Mayor’s
banquet. Civic feeding needs all the respectable
discouragement it can get.
“Australia in its entirety cannot differ in
opinion from its component parts, and every
colony in the group has now declared in favour of
protection to native industry.”—The Age.
“Tax the wealthy!” says the N.S.W.
Freetrade party. Yet, when it comes to a pinch,
Reid, the high-priest of Cobdenism, absolutely
dares not pronounce in favour of a land-tax.
The Victorian Governmenthas orderedalot
of swords from Japan, because the Imperial
article invariably goes back on the wieldar. A
foreign sword may yet sever those silken bonds.
Sydney Star persistently denounces the
tax on unimproved land values, though the Dibbs
Ministry voted for it as an abstraction, and
though it is embodied in their Local Government
Bill.
An ex-member of N.S.W. Parliament
wonders what relation there is between the
additional Treasury deficit and the fresh Civil
Service appointments made by the present Govern-
ment.
The wholesale perfidy and corruption of
the present Kanakaland Parliament is only
rivalled by the unblushing, individual dishonesty
of several prominent Gumsucker politicians and
public men.
South Australia has had four Ministries in
two and a-half years. Twenty out of the 54
members of Assembly have been Ministers of the
Crown—five of them twice—since Parliament met
in June, 1890.
A large proportion of the tramps “ free-
passed ” into S.A. by the N.S.W. Govt, are
“free labourers ” who have been “ sacked.” The
“free labour” was obtained .by the mines from
the scum of Melbourne.
“As foreign to him as soap to a stump-
orator,” remarks Sydney Daily Telegraph.
You can always tell when a paper is owned by
the greasy bourgeoisie. It is always so proud of
its recently acquired soap-habit.
Dr. £. £. Smith, M.P., of Melbourne,
is of opinion that “if Parliament were shut up
for two years, it would be better for Victoria.”
£. £. has evidently formed a pretty accurate idea
of the condition in which he would be of most use
to the country.
Chief Justice Higinbotham won’t, or at all
events doesn’t, take the Victorian Acting-Gover-
norship, which devolves on Williams, though
Hoiroyd is next in seniority. So people conclude
that Hoiroyd is loyally quaky, too—a parlous and
Lilleyish state of things.
J. B. Patterson raises his voice in favour
of a modified Libel Law, and in admiration of the
Press. Times must have changed since this same
J.B.P. scoffed at dead Marcus Clarke in the Vic.
Assembly, and asserted that the country “ wanted
thinkers, not scribblers.”
Whatever Downer may say about his
democratic opinions, his Ministry will be actively
supported bv the S. A. “National Ass ” next year.
And should "there be a Conservative majority, the
electors will have to swallow a property tax, dis-
guised as a “ wealth tax.”
Speaking of the rumoured promise to
release the Broken Hill Defence Committee in
return for Labour votes, said Arthur Rae, M.L. A.;
“ If political influence can be used to put men in
prison I don’t see why it shouldn’t be used to get
them out.” Barton scowled.
The increased Victorian postage, which
was estimated to yield £70,000 extra, has yielded
£lO,OOO less than under the old system. The
spirit-revenue for the year is £70,000 below the
estimate. The live-stock duty, estimated to
produce £130,000, gave only £17,000.
At an Fiiiglish Women’s Emancipation
meeting: “If women could shoot straight, men
would not trifle with us as they do to-day. If we
had a regiment of women who could shoot, we
would have the franchise in a week. ” Yes, indeed.
And if women weren’t afraid of mice !
The N.S.W. Labour, Party can’t elect a
leader. They have tried over and over again, but
the internal jealousies of the party forbid it.
Before next election every labour nominee should
have to declare in writing that if elected he will
abide by the majority’s choice of a leader.
The latest N.S.W. National Ass dodge is to
discredit the labour cause with the farmers, at
present the Conservatives’ last hope in N.S.W.,
as in Victoria, by spreading a rumour that swag-
men threaten to burn out the Doniliquin farmers
as revenge for the conviction of the Barrier men.
A pregnant sign of the times that ex-
Prcmier the Marquis of Salisbury, head of
British Conservatism, shouldbesummonedforown-
ing and letting out in London dwellings unfit for
human habitation ! And ordered to demolish
them ! The caul-fat of landlordism begins to
sizzle.
If anyone were to yard-up, in one enclosed
space, all the present Australian members of Par-
liament, blindfold himself, catch one haphazard,
and paste on that one a big placard—“ Thief and
Liar,” the indictment would most probably hold
good, and be capable of even legal proof before
any disinterested tribunal.
Justice Hood has casually observed that
there ought to be another prosecution “in regard
to the Clara Parker case.” Premier Shiels’
attention was drawn to this learned utterance, it
appears, but “ nothing has transpired to justify
action.” The Bulletin hopes this will be a warn-
ing to judges not to pass opinions on legal
matters.
Why did the S.M. Herald entirely sup-
press the excellent and pregnant speech delivered
by Labour-member Cook during the Federation
debate in N.S.W. Assembly? The Herald is
perhaps the dullest daily paper in the world. The
comparatively few people who pay twopence for
it only do so because of the superstition that it is
a “fair ” paper.
Hoylo, M.P. (N.S.W. - ), who lately de-
nounced Socialism at a public lecture as the
gospel of dynamite, revolution, and irreligiqn,
just 15 months ago, ere voting for the State
quarrying of marble, declared himself thrice to be
a State Socialist, and said that the State should
be the only employer. The noble society of
turners once more.
A SEASONABLE ARRIVAL.
James Munro returns to Victoria in time to get his goose cooked.
Parkes was even more snaky and slippery
than usual in his address to the “ great Freetrade
meeting ”at Melbourne. He was only emphatic
when he began to prophesy; then, with great
resolution, he predicted the utter abolition of
Customs-houses from off the face of the earth.
But as he did not fix a date, he possibly believes
the Last Man may be a Customs official.
Dibbs to Downer re free passes to Broken
Hill unemployed :
I regret you should think fit to offer your protest upon
the generosity of the Government to men who, despite
their folly in striking, are j et entitled to live.
“ Entitled to live !” Noble* generous man ! Now
we know why Sleath, Ferguson and Co. were not
hanged.
In France, more than half the people own
the houses they live in, and much more than half
the heads of families are land-owners. Among
10,000,000 electors, over 3,000,000 are employers ;
over 6,000,000 are working on their own account;
and the balance is made up of “persons of indepen-
dent means.” What other state on earth is built
on such a solid democratic basis as this? Shall
we follow England—or France ?
Both leading parties in the N.S.W.
Assembly have now admitted—the Opposition in
attack, the Ministry in defence-that any class
use of law furnishes a legitimate excuse for the
upholding and pulling down of Ministries. The
Opposition used the Broken Hill affair as a means
to power, and the Government’s understrappers
circulated a report that the men were about to bo
released in order to sway votes.
“I’ll rule this way to-night, anyhow,” is
the way Speaker Bent, of Victoria, always gets
out of a difficulty. Bent’s rulings are erratic and
members are always reminding him of how he is
overturning his own precedents, and pointing out
that he ruled the other way last night or last
week. And then the inflamed fat man gets red
with excitement, and lays down the law with a
crash; “ Don’t oare; I’ll rule this way to-night,
anyhow.”
MTntyre, M.L.A., objects to newspapers
“mopping up all the best lawyers to defend
them,” as in the Speight v. Syme case now pend-
ing. We haven’t heard MTntyre’s sentiments
upon the mopping up of the Melbourne bar by a
certain old friend of his. If David Syme were a
busted boomer, which he isn’t, there would be no
objection, seemingly, to his mopping up every
lawyer and legislator in the land.
George Cotton, M.L.O. (S.A.), who died
the other day, was a staunch friend to labour.
The workmen’s block system, which he practically
introduced, is very successful and has enabled
many a poor devil to tide over bad times and poor
wages. George was a poor speaker, but he worked
like a nigger and was (nearly always) sure of his
facts. The Wesleyan body, to which he nominally
belonged, hated him voluminously for his out-
spokenness.
One parson Yule, of Melbourne, lately
advanced it as an argument in favour of sectarian,
as against “godless,” education, “that the some-
what lame jokes of the Premier at the Mayor’s
banquet could not have been understood without
a knowledge of the Bible.” Parson Yule is a
Presbyterian; no one but a Presbyterian would
have suggested, in all seriousness, that the Bible
was given to man t« enable him to understand
Shiels’ jokes.
Coroner Wynne Baxter, of London, while
inquesting a man who died from hunger, recently
remarked that he was really astonished the British
unemployed didn’t emigrate to Australia, where it
was impossible for them to starve. Always the
same old story—“ Move on ! ” Move on to
America or Australia or Gehenna or anywhere,
but move on, anyhow. There is always a mirage-
land of promise ahead for the tattered wretch who
keeps moving on.
The O’Sullivan writes to Sydney D.T.
advocating a Coalition and the abolition of Party
Government —that is to say, he advocates the
Coalition first, and the abolition afterwards. In
other words, Frankenstein O’Sullivan proposes to
build a monster and then abolish it —if the mon-
ster will let him and provided the monster doesn’t
abolish him. O’Sullivan also says that in future
he is going to ignore parties and serve only under
the banner of his Public Works Committee —we
mean his country.
The Bulletin was the first existing
metropolitan paper to advocate Protection in
N.S.W. One of its chief reasons for doing so was
to form a clear, sharp, dividing line between the
two political parties, and thus bring Parkes’
noxious personal domination to an end. The
Bulletin’s end has been achieved, and Parkes is
now practically wrecked. The next step is to
confront the only real parties—the progressive
Radical Republicans and the Conservative
A ustralian British-ti tle-h unters.
Sydney Truth attributes this to Sir
Charles Dilke: —
Sir Henry Parkes was born with half the ability of a
statesman, and he obtained the education of an alderman.
Over and over and over again Sir Henry Parkes has told us
that he was the architect of his own fortune, and over
and over again we have thought he ought to have prose-
cuted the aforesaid architect. Tiiat architect began at
the roof of the structure and worked down.
As a matter of fact, this was written by John
Haynes—whom Parkes had told that he “ wanted
neither his support nor his acquaintance.”
Two samples of the language which led up
to the Kingston-Baker duelling episode in
Adelaide. Baker on Kingston :
I have been attacked by a man who is well known to be
as big a coward as he is a big bully, who is a member of
and a disgrace to the legal profession. . . .”
Kingston on Baker :
I have proved him politically to be false as a friend,
treacherous as a colleague, mendacious as a man, and
utterly untrustworthy in every relationship of public life,
and now he has added to the accumulated disgrace of a
lifetime the crowning ignominy of an unjust Judge.
(Cheers.)
The Melbourne Argus states that, during
the late crisis, the N.S.W. Labour-party waited
uneasily and in silence to “discover which of the
two great parties was likely to have a majority,
in order that they might cast in their lot with the
stronger side.” This is wholly untrue. That
the Labour-men did not speak early in the debate
is due to the fact that Ministers and ex-Ministers
are always first called on by the Speaker; that
they did not vote with the stronger side is shown
by the fact that 13 Labour members voted with
and 18 against the Ministry, while two refrained
from voting.
Parkes, in the femininely venomous attack
he makes upon G. H. Reid in his book, has over-
reached himself. He will sorely need Reid’s
co-operation in solidifj ing the N.S.W. Freetrade
party, in which the eyeglassed man is, has been, and
must remain, a big factor. Reid (by whom Parkes
will stand for the purpose only of pouring snake-
juice into his political wounds) could no doubt
have forgiven Parkes’ hasty expressions—but (now
that Reid is married) there will, despite all G. H.
R.’s protestations to the contrary, be no forgive-
ness for Parkes’ action in contemptuously set-
ting him down in cold, enduring print on
thick paper as a mere voluble ass. True,
Parkes’ magnum onus will soon be in the
dirt-box, and you will be able to get it out of
the eighteenpenny basket at the booksellers’ door
if you wait a few months. But even that won’t,
satisfy Reid.
The Dibbs Government (N. S. W.) has givbn
notice that it proposes to put its foot down on the
adjournment nuisance and various others. Accord-
ing to the proposed arrangement nobody will bo
allowed to move the adjournment of the House
unless 20 members rise to support him; the
speeches on an adjournment motion are to be
limited to a certain number of minutes ; and the
rule that no new businessshall betakenafterllp.m.
is to bo rescinded. When these three innovations
are effected there will be practically no method of
stonewalling left in the N.S.W. Legislature except
by making long speeches on Government bills,
moving several hundred amendments in Com-
mittee, moving that the Chairman report progress,
moving for select committees, moving that the
House be counted, moving no-confidence resolu-
tions, making personal explanations, getting up
rows and then apologising, bringing in bogus kills,
asking questions, and 16 or 18 other devices.
Demos ; —“ The English people ought to
be enlightened on this disgraceful Victorian mace
mystery. The Government knew well enough
what had transpired, but lied, to bamboozle the
public. The question may well be asked what is
the value of a Government under which drunkards
and debauchees can obtain such authority. For
my own part, I shall deliberately set myself to
conspire against the whole rotten system. The
mere fact of a man like M. H. Davies becoming
Speaker, with Munro for his Premier, leads to
an inquiry why our political arrangements are so
devised as to secure the elevation by their
colleagues of drunken and powerfully influential
members, who can thieve the outward and visible
emblem of Parliamentary authority and carry it
off to a brothel, and also introduce prostitutes
within what ought to be the clean, if not absolutely
sacred, precincts of Parliament. This country is
sick of the Parliamentary system and its flood of
cackle, a burlesque on English institutions.”
Wolfe’s Schnapps may be relied upon in all
seasons as the purest and best of liquors.
Why It Is So.
Do you ever wonder why there is invariably
more sickness prevailing at the change of the
seasons—just before summer and winter —than at
other times of the year? You are aware that the
doctors are always busier at those periods; yet you
have not probably surmised the reasons, although
they are very simple. In the period preceding
Summer the amount and nature of the food taken
is generally similar to that used in the coldest
winter weather, and the quantity of clothing worn
is not adapted to the increasing temperature—
both regimen and covering being unsuitable. Dur-
ing the Autumn, people, by the use of improper
viands, by taking hasty meals, by exposure, and
the consumption of immoderate quantities of acid
and iced drinks—induce a condition of Gastric or
Stomachic Catarrh. When this condition is
present the foods are imperfectly acted upon by
the digestive organs, and the nutriment matter
not being in form for assimilation, is carried
along with the blood to the kidneys, whose pro-
vince it is to take out of the vital fluid the waste
and harmless products—urea and uric acid. This
process going on for weeks, or possibly months,
the over-worked kidneys—by becoming inflamed
or congested—fail to perform their functions, with
the result that the deleterious products are re-
tained in the system, to the inevitable corruption
of the blood. Dyspepsia with its many well-
known forms of agony having become established,
gives due warning that active measures should be
adopted to intercept some approaching more
serious malady—it may be rheumatism, gout,
diabetes, gravel and gall stones, or the dread
Bright’s disease. Warner’s Safe Cure is the
required antidote.
Here we emphasise the necessity for using that
medicine during the present season on account
of the threatened epidemic of influenza. It is an
undoubted fact that when the kidneys and liver
are kept in a healthy and normal condition, the
germs of disease cannot find a lodgment in the
system, but are promptly passed off through the
excretions.
Warner’s Safe Cure, therefore, may be taken
with positive satisfaction, its power to keep these
chief organs of the human economy in good work-
ing order having become fully demonstrated. The
trite saying, “ That an ounce of prevention is worth
a pound of cure,” has in no case a more forcible
application than in relation to the bodily health.

How is it, seeing that the inhabitants of
Scotland object to being ( called “ Scotchmen,
that the well-known Melbourne school is officially
named the “Scotch College?” However, perhaps
the authorities are only Scotch, not Scottish, ye

beastly Scutch.

An accomplished architect, a married ulan,
who some five years ago had one of the largest
practices in Sydney, and who levanted with a fair
companion, has been heard of from America,
Where he is working on a cattle ranch. He only
took about iHOOO with him, and left behind lain
Work in the office to the value of .4280,000. the
day he left Sydney he wrote in his diary at the
office* “ Geo 1-bye* boys. God bless you all!” The
wdmail has, of course* left him, after running
through his money;
Women registrars bf births and deaths

That snaky reptile, the
private detective, was lurkily in
evidence in recent just-abandoned
Australian divorce proceedings,
when a lately suspicious and now
penitent husband “ took it all back”
and ‘ ‘ begged pardon. ” About the
only good use to which anyone
can put a private detective is to
hand him over for anatomical
analysis to a committee of social
purity she-cats who want slander
and piquant slush supplied by the
bucketful. A jealous husband had
far better hang himself than hire a
private detective, while a suspicious
and enterprising wife might just
as well turn Lais at once as give
her whole life and reputation into
the keeping of such a venomous
toad and manufacturing liar.

The story goes that Premier
Dibbs was lately entertained at
dinner, with barbaric splendour,
by an Austr.ilce man who rents a
colossal house and prides himself
on his personal resemblance to the
Prince of Wales—a resemblance, by
the way. which is shared by over
so many fat money-lenders. It
isn’t, you see, that they arc kingly,
but that Tummy is vulgar. Fat
is vulgarity. But no matter. “Now,
Sir Chorge, tell us, doesn’t our hosd
look like dor Prince?” yelled a
“ financier ” from the other end of
the table. “Yes, that is so,” said
George as in duty bound. But Sir
George doesn’t dell his vrendts
whether the Prince talks like the ham-fat man
who gave the gorge.

The Adelaide Police Band serves the use-
ful purpose of making Commissioner Peterswald
popular at a cheap rate in the “ upper ” circles ot
society. Peterswald won’t allow the bandsmen
to accept any remuneration in current com.
Liberal persons—like Governor Robinson and
Governor Kintore —used to allow the men a glass
of “colonial” apiece on a hot day; but every-
body is not liberal, and some of the local big-wigs
make their garden parties hum at the expense of
the strong-lunged bobbies. “ Peter ” is always
asked, and conies as often.
Cabbage-treed gentlemen from the back-
blocks will note that it is now the correct thing
in Sydney to get your silk-hat blocked while you
wait. The wonder is that Australian exquisites
have waited so long ere adopting a custom which
is as common in London and New York as the
boodle-bloated alderman or the deserving poor.
Chief Justice Darley is one of the patrons of the
newly-developed industry, and the inquisitive
visitor may find that luminary—hatless and wig-
less—adorning the inside of fashionable hatters
shops whilst his tile, which has just been sent up in
the lift, is being polished. In London, a real dude
gets his hat ironed every 100 yards he walks.

A New Caledonian convict wished to
marry a female prisoner, and got the necessary
permit. As he described himself as a widower,
the priest required proof Of his first wife’s death
before performing the ceremony. “ Saere! ’
growled the groom in the hearing of the bride,
“ what more proof do you want than my sentence
which shows that I Was sent here for killing her?’
The Woman took him notwithstanding.

Justice overtook a Very ancient sinner the
other day. Twenty-eight years ago a young mall
named Potter deserted his yoilttg wife at Ballarat,
and left her to struggle With ft cold, hard world
by herself. Last Week an old man trained Potter
was arrested at Auckland (M.L.) on an infoima-
tion laid by a haggard, careworn old woman from
Ballarat, and was Ordered to pay £1 a week foi-
lier support. They didn’t seem glad to meet each
other. All the romance had gone out of love’s
young dream, and it was just like drinking the
beer that was Uncorked 28 years ago.

The other clay an armless Christchurch
(Maoriland) woman was married. The groom
placed the ring on one of her toes. We remember
the proposal ; “Taking her little white foot in his
hand, he murmured fondly—* Darling, may I have
this for my very own ?’ ” Whereupon she referred
him to “ Pa,” of course.
A SYDNEY STREET-SKETCH.
(The mid-day prayer-meeting.)
A certain Victorian hostelry has much to
answer for. During the last year two barmaids
employed there have suicided. One of them
poisoned herself in Melbourne, after having
strangled her infant with a piece of braid torn
from her skirt. Mother and child met on the
slabs of the morgue. The other girl went to Syd-
ney, and, after writing a very London Jouknal-
ish letter, allowed a train to run over her.

Sydney D.T. apologises for having stated
that Dan O’Connor, who has had to resign his
seat in N.S.W. Legislative Council through bank-
ruptcy, cordially welcomed a surprise party at his
house the other evening. When a man fails and
loses his seat in Parliament it is bad enough, but
when lie has his home invaded by a set of vulgar
bandits in the guise of a “surprise party” the
cup of bitterness overflow’s. Yet, the Telegraph
published the story as a festive item, and seems to
think Daniel would have enjoyed the party had it
come off.

Letter received by the manager of an
unexceptionably-conduoted Sydney hostelry ;
Dear Friend,—A Christian sister, utterly unknown to
you, is now addressing you. What for? say you.
Because, though a stranger, you are a brother for whom
Christ shed His precious blood, and because in the busi-
ness you are now in I most solemnly.ask you—How can
you hope to be washed in that cleansing blood ? Oh ! stay
and just consider this, that if Christ’s death is nothing to
you —if you are not washed in His precious blood. Again
I say, pause and consider this, dear friend, your long
eternity must be spent out of Heaven, and not in the
mansions fair and bright. Again, supposing you care
nothing for these things (which God forbid), how about
your children brought up in such an atmosphere ? How
about the poor creatures whom your hands supply with
the maddening drink from day to day ? Are you willing
to face the awful responsibility of your children’s souls
and their drink-sodden brothers? Again, listen, “Thy
brother’s blood crieth to Me from the earth.” Me, not
only the dear Father, hut the Judge. Oh ! may you he
led to give up your business, and may you and I meet in

In one province of Japan it is the correct
thing for a man who means matrimony to seize

her off to his house. Then the maiden’s parents
either call and fetch her away again, or leave

of this custom would work very well in Sydney or
Melbourne. Lots of girls would give anything to

THE HOSPITAL NURSE.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
I got hurt in a railway collision,
And they carried me up to her ward;
1 don’t go in much for religion,
But for that smash I do thank the Lord.
For looked so natty and winning
In he’r uniform dainty and trim,
That I loved her right from the beginning,
Though I hadn’t an uninjured limb.
She would bandage me up in the oddest
Positions; then, with a grimace,
She whispered, “ Don’t deem me immodest—
“ You are not a man now, you’re a case !”
The evening before I was leaving
She was singing away in her room,
When my ami with an ease that’s deceiving
Found its way round her waist in the gloom.
“ Now I’m well, must I love you and leave you?
Won’t you nurse me the rest of life’s span ?”
Her reply was: “ I don’t like to grieve
For you’re not a case now—you’re a man.”
Well, I’ve never had cause to regret her,
Better fellows have often done worse
’Twas the turn of my luck when I met her,
My dear little Hospital Nurse.

“ Bow before your future king 1” ?
Is the Institute a place where
People worship, finding grace there

Service starls at eight or nine,
And the bells from holy tower
Call attention to the hour?

Some months back an article was published
in Westminster Review, entitled “The Great
West of Australia.” In it appeared the astonish-
ing statement that spinifex was considered highly
fattening. A Sydney man wrote to the editor of
the periodical pointing out the error. The other
day he received an answer—The writer states that
“ l>e does not profess to be an expert bush-squatter,
but that lie was told by squatters (presumedly
tcuvn squatters) that sheep fatten on spinifex.”
When articles professing to deal with Australia
from a specialist’s stand-point are founded on
such second-hand information as this who can
wonder that not even a Dibbs can dispel the
clouds of ignorance prevailing concerning our
lutle continent ?
The O’Hooligan’s pub., at the Gluepot,
was famed for its original kerosene liquor, and for
the hearty welcome tendered by the host to all
who patronised Ids lonely shanty. One evening,
a dream of bush loveliness hopped off the
Warragul coach, followed by her newly-elected
husband. She was so lovely that the bank-clerk,
the doctor, and the curate from “Kelly’s Gully”
were lured into the dining-room, ostensibly to
have tea, but in reality to further inspect the
charmer. Tea hour came, but the damsel sat
alongside her hubby and spake not. The
O’Hooligan at last coaxed her to talk with : “Can
I assist yez (she had already had four helpings)
to another potato, or a cut off the roast ?” Vision
of Loveliness : “Ahem! No tank yez, if I tuk
another pertator I declare I’d be fit to busht.” —

From a correspondent : — Apropos the fine
inflicted on publican Bacchus, of Sydney, for
selling methylated grog. G , who” keeps the
principal iiotel here and a barman, was long sus-
pected by the latter of tampering with the liquors
kept for “flush ” customers and “cheque-men.”
Oscar, the barman, recently changed the order of
the bottles in the bar, when the proprietor, in the
course of business, helped himself unknowingly to
whisky from one of the bottles set apart for bush-
men. Later, the doctor had to be called in on
behalf of Mr. G , who, said the medico., was
clearly suffering from poison. Again, Father ,
travelling down the River Road, put up for the
night at Mrs. O’ ’s hotel, and was treated by
the widow with every consideration. As the
weather was hot, his Reverence decided upon
making a start at daylight, and so the widow
instructed Bridget to brew for the good man rum
and milk before his departure. A few hours later
a pair of horses were found racing through the
bush with a buggy-pole attached, and further
search discovered the trap smashed up and his
reverence prone in the dust insensible. The rev.
gentleman’s rescuer handed him over to Mrs. O’ —,
with, “Faith, mem, if it wasn’t the praste, I’d
say he was drunk.” Subsequent inquiries proved
that Bridget, good, simple soul, had helped his
reverence out of the diggers’ bottle. It’ll take a
lot of prayer to put that smiling colleen into a
“ state of grace.”—J.C. W.

The interminable question as to Whether

they wish to deny it isn’t very apparent. It is a
weirdly dramatic incident—the pallid, wasted,

have done so.

Dear Bulletin, —The Port Glasgow case
reminds me somewhat of the eventful voyage of
the American barque, William Tapsoott, which
arrived in Wellington (M.L.) some time during
72—130 days out from ’Frisco. The skipper
was “a daisy.” When he wanted a hand he’d
playfully call him aft by shooting at him.
About once a day he would come for’ard to the
fo’castle and, shouting out “Stand clear! ’ plant
half-a-dozen shots among the bunks “just to
keep the watch below lively.” Another time he
put a shot through a man’s cap whilst ‘Said man
was takina: in the topsail because he left one of
the gaskets untidy. The crew was brought up at
Wellington for refusing duty, and discharged. The
captain offered <£6o a man for another crew to
work the ship to Queenstown, and, of course, soon
made up a ship’s company. The run lasted 60
days, so each man got a pound a day. I think
the skipper was lost at sea next voyage. The
wonder is he wasn’t lost before. —Yours,

Alexandre Dumas, the younger: “Women

their husband, but of their hatred of the latter
simply because he is their husband.”
“ He never loafs either at work or play ;
he does whatever he is called upon to do with all
his might ; he is respectful to his elders, not only
cheerfully obedient to rules and regulations, but

In a certain Maoriland village , the local
tyrant is a wealthy Scotchman who owns nearly
everything around in the shape of lands and
houses and sheep and cattle. Fortunately for the
landlord, the one thing he doesn’t own is the local
pub. Thus, Mac. invariably winds up his
periodical sprees’ by entering the hostelry and
smashing all the bottles and glasses he. can see.
Thu landlord is always prepared for this festivity,
so that, when Mac, starts smashing, the only
damage he does is to half-empty bottles containing
water. But, of course, the broken bottles are
charged for (twice over) as if they had contained
the most expensive spirits ever corked. Mac.
walks in a few days afterwards. “ How much ? ”

The practical is slowly and. surely exor-
cising the supernatural. At Auckland, a business-
like heathen, named Tauwaha, claims £2O damages
from a Maori lady who accused him of witchcraft.

A meeting of cremationists was held
recently in Melbourne, and Judge Williams, who
was present, gladdened the audience with the
information that there is no law to prevent any
man burning his dead in his own garden, provided
he doesn’t create a nuisance in the process. The
certificate of death must be obtained, of course,
but when that legal formality has been complied
with a man can simply lay in two tons of fire-
wood, pour kerosene over it, put his mother-in-
law on top, and set the whole thing alight. When
the public fully realises how much money can be
saved in this way the undertaker’s “ad.” will
assume a new shape. Then the friends of John
Smith will be invited, by advertisement, to attend
the obsequies of his lamented relative, Ann Jones,
who will be burnt in his back yard, at Colling-
wood, to-morrow night, at eight, and the timber-
merchant who supplies the combustibles will pnt
his name at the foot. Also the old women who
are so fond of coming in to look at the corpse will
come and inspect the ashes instead, whicli will
probably be quite as consoling. Even cremation
isn’t an adequate remedy for the old women who
always want to look at the deceased.

Mysterious paragraph from Sydney It,

A meeting to further consider the question of the pro-
posed central cemetery was held at Chines on Monday,
when most of the dairy factories were represented. It
was the unanimous opinion of those present that the com-
party should be confined to the factories and dairymen of
the Lismore district. A resolution was carried that tin
matter be taken up by the factories. It was also resolved
that the dairy factories having a daily supply of 500
gallons should contribute £3OO towards the capital.
( 1 lie prize poem at the “ Mount Gambier
(S. A.) Christ Church Exhibition” was about the
World’s Fair at the hog eity of Shikago. Here is
a bit of the peroration :
Who says the days of chivalry are over ?
Two white potentates (one of them a J.P.) met
the other day in Queensland to fight to a finish for
the possession of an elderly gin. After seven
rounds, the dark and swollen eyes of the majesty
of the law rained tears and blood, and the other
man took the lady. The fight was the outcome of
a little brush in the local Court about the same
girl. The victor in the superior Court had been
brought up in the lower charged on a warrant
with having taken a black gin by force from bet
employers, a pastoral co., and had had to travel
214 miles in custody to answer the charge. Six
years, ago he brought in two gins, and gave one of
them to a black boy. Not until he left the station
did the manager claim the gin, and then lie got
the warrant issued on the ground that he had
entered into an agreement with her—an agreement
which was neither written nor verbal, but cus-
tomary—and that he had always regarded her as
his servant, so much so, in fact, that he felt himself
justified in flogging her witli a stockwhip whenever
she ran away or otherwise deserved punishment.
He knew when she deserved it—he was a J.P.
Somehow the Court didn't see it, and dismissed
the case. clearly proves that what is
wanted up North is a law providing that managers
of stations who arc also J.sP. may take into their
own hands the whole care of the domestic and
moral education of aborigines, without let or hin-
drance from a Bench which may be prejudiced in
favour of administering the law”as its stands.
On a Bush Track.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“ Mabel, my dear, I don’t like the thought of
your going alone through the bush to the school.”
“ Why, mother ?”
“Well, the starting of the railway works has
brought a lot of queer characters hereabout.”
“ Oh, don’t fear, mother, no one would touch
me. I must go at once, or I shall be late for
school.” And with a farewell kiss the girl was
gone.
Mrs. Brown watched her daughter out of sight,
and then, with a sigh, turned to her household
work.
Mabel Brown was the teacher at the
in the small bush township of Shepherd’s "Gully,
Gippsland, and, though a recent arrival, was
already a general favourite. Her figure was tali,
graceful and well-proportioned, and her face was
fair. Oilers of marriage she had had in abund-
ance, but she had declined them all and remained
to cheer her widowed mother’s declining years.
Fearless as a child, she always went to the town-
ship through a wide belt of gloomy bush where
the tall eucalypti cast a shadow dark as night
upon the dank tree-ferns and stunted tea-tree
scrub; already a small track, devious as the
course of a rivulet, had been worn by her tiny
feet.
On this particular morning she entered the bush
singing blithely as was her wont, and laughing as
she thought of her mother’s absurd forebodings.
B it as she proceeded, and the shadows of the giant
gums grew denser, a vague feeling of timidity or
doubt foi the first time overtook her. She hesi-
tated a moment, and had some idea of turning
back, but an instant later her courage returned
•and she proceeded on her way. And now she
was in the very heart of the bush, and a dead
silence reigned around her. Hark! what was
that? A found as of the crunching of dead
brandies beneath heavy footsteps. Her heart
well-nigh ceased to beat as her mother’s words of
foreboding returned to her.
Her courage vanished, and as she stood trem-
bling in every limb a hoarse voice cried, “Come
on, Bill, we’ve got her now ! ”
A rough and sinister-looking man bounded out
from the bush in front of her, and almost simul-
taneously another, of still less inviting aspect,
alighted on the track behind.
Her retreat was cut off, and escape was impos-
sible. She turned ghastly pale and stood as if
transfixed.
“ Gosh, Miss Brown, is it you ? Sandy an’ mo
thought you was our red cab when we heerd you
coinin’ along ! ! ”

A fact, well known to physicians and all who
have studied the cause of disease, is that inaction
of the liver and kidneys gives rise to more con-
stitutional disturbances than all other causes put
together. Inaction of these organs results in re-
tention of the waste products and effete matter in
the various valves, ducts, and glands of the diges-
tive apparatus and excretory channels, where it
becomes impacted. The liver is the organ destined
to secrete a natural cathartic fluid, called bile,
intended to carry oh from the system all waste,
poisonous and worthless material by its natural
excretive action. Headaches, Constipation,
Aching Limbs, Languor, Tired Feelings,
Backache, Costive ness, Painful Micturation,
Giddiness, Indigestion, &0., are all signs of a
torpid liver, and serious disease will set in if the
digestive and eliminative organs do not properly
perform their several functions. Dr. Fletcher’s
Pills are prepared on a scientific principle to
prevent impaction of hsepatic glands, &o. They
act on the only rational principle of curing and
preventing disease, do not gripe or purge, but
stimulate the organs to perform their allotted
duties, increasing the secretion of bile, which
evacuates and invigorates the clogged passages,
restoring a healthy action and condition without
the annoyance, discomfort and pain of griping
and purging. Patients are requested to get the
genuine Dr. Fletcher’s Pills and refuse all sub-
stitutes. All dealers stock them ;or post free for

There are moments in the lives of each of us
when, in the midst of unexpected, uaforesei u dansrer, we
shall require to exercise to its utmost extent all the
nervous power we may possess. And there is no greater
foe or danger to happiness than debilitv, which ought to
be carefully warded off. In the following case Mr. E.
Robinson, of Tumut, N.S.W., gives his experience of it:
“ For the last three or four years I have been conscious
that my strength, and in an equal decree my spirits, were
waning. I was losing all interest in anything and in
everything. I could not account for it. lat last began
to suspect I might have the seeds of consumption sown in
my system, and that they were bringing forth fruit. I
saw your advertisement in the Sydney Herald, and
resolved to try what Marshall’s Tonic Nervine could, do
for me—this was five months ago. I have completed a
course of 18 bottles, and I can truly say a man in better
health and spirits cannot exist. I eat well, sleep well
and take any amount of physical exercise, long walks’
and feel no fatigue, and my strength is apparent to me in
every mov'ement I make, every step I tike. All this I
owe to you and your sovereign remedy. Let the world
know. You are only too welcome to publish this, in the
hope other poor sufferers may make use of your strength
giving fluid.” Will “other poor sufferers ’’ hesitate now?
Marshall’s Tonic Nervine is within the reach of all.

WE understand that the First Sub-division
of this Famous Estate, consisting of
37,700 acres, will be submitted by AUCTION at
TOOWOOMBA, ON JANUARY Ist, 1893,
in 250 Farms, varying from 20 to 2560 acres, all
admirably adapted for dairy, agricultural or
grazing farms.
The soil, climate, and position cannot be sur-
passed in Australia, being of easy access to all the
Queensland and New South Wales markets, the
Southern and Western Railway lines, with numer-
ous railway stations, running through the estate in
a very convenient manner ; and the rising city of
Toowooomba is within six miles of some of the
sub-divisions. The water supply is abundant and
permanent, and the lands are all ready for the
plough. Oats, barley, maize, potatoes, and all
descriptions of fruits, including peaches, apples,
apricots, vines, olives, ,&c., grow to perfection,
and yield enormous crops.

Pm-ify yomr Blood with Ayer’s Sarsa-
parilla, the most thoroughly reliable altera-
tive ever compounded. For scrofula, boils,
ulcers, sores, carbuncles, pimples, and all
disorders originating in vitiated blood, this
medicine is unsurpassed. As a tonic,
Iyer’s Sarsaparilla
assists the process of digestion, stimu-
lates the liver, strengthens the nerves, and
builds up the body when debilitated by fa-
tigue or illness. Many people waste money
by experimenting with compounds, the prin-
cipal recommendation of which would seem
to be their “ cheapness.” The most reliable
medicines are costly, and can be retailed at
moderate prices only when the manufactur-
ing chemist handles the raw materials in
large quantities. It is economy, therefore, to
Use Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, the valuable com-
ponents of which are imported, wholesale,
from the regions where these articles are
richest in medicinal properties.

Discoursing upon a recent “disloyal”
demonstration at Montreal, the Age quotes the
Marquis of Lome’s statement to the effect that
Canadian desire for annexation to the States is
confined to the border provinces on either side.
“Montreal is a border city, and, as such, is not
in any way typical of the Dominion generally.”
Montreal, as it happens, isn’t a border town, and
its Mur’kan tendencies are certainly not the
result of its geographical position. The Age
must have been thinking about Toronto, where
the people are rather more Yankee than the

Knight Wrixon found his cackle drowned
in shrieks of laughter last week, when he men-
tioned the name of the Victorian Parliament at
the Town Hall meeting. “Am I to understand
that you regard with contempt the proceedings of
your own Parliament? ” snuffled the righteous
man. And the voice of the multitude yelled
“ Yes !’’ Then Wrixon reiterated the awful truth
which Victoria never takes to its puny, parochial
heart. He told the scoffers that the sins of the
"Ouse were on their thick heads, i.e., he told them,
in his heavy, legislative way, that they were
answerable for the men who sat in Parliament.
A fair rebuke. The average Cabbage Gardener
derives some idiotic pleasure from voting for the
vulgar fraud he openly despises.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
In Melbourne, the other day, a bank-clerk, who
had lost a small amount of the bank’s money in specula-
tion, took some £4OO out of the till and proceeded to
plunge on a moral at a suburban horse-race, with an
honest desire to get square. The moral that he plunged
on didn’t come off, and he is now “in the soup and as a
consequence all the pious papers are wailing regretfully
about the folly of backing a horse with borrowed money,
and pointing out that it always leads to destruction.
The Bulletin is very tired of this utterly hollow kind of
sermon. Backing a horse with stolen cash doesn’t always
lead to destruction—not by a long way. Many a man
who, if he had been gifted with cast-iron honesty, would
have been a poor, struggling clerk to the end of his days,
has stolen some of his employer’s cash, and staked it
successfully on a race, and after repaying the embezzled
funds has gone into business with his winnings and pros-
pered ever afterwards. But the public never hears of
such cases, for the successful speculator, when he becomes
old and fat, never tells a Sunday-school class how he once
stood on a racecourse in a cold sweat of anxiety, with
visions of a gaol floating before his staring eyes, and how,
when his horse won, he heaved his hat wildly in the air
and it has never come down again from that day to this,
ft is only the unsuccessful speculator that the public
hears about so regularly.

summing-up the evidence, pointed out “ that the persons
who were present at a fight of this kind were held guilty
of manslaughter in the event of the contest ending

present were guilty of manslaughter, and The Bulletin
is anxiously awaiting news of their arrest.

Mr. George Washington Gurden, of Clinton
(M.L.), relates the following story which, had he not been
christened G. W., would be incredible. He was fishing
intheClutha River and hooked the tail of a cow which
was grazing behind him. His line broke just then, and
the cow departed with several fly-books hanging from her
tail. George tried to catch her but failed, and went home
to dinner. On turning out again iu the afternoon he met
the cow coming from the river in a great hurry with a big
trout pendant from her tail, jumping on the grass behind

hooked the fish, which George Washington aforesaid

Donnan secures a big trophy from a Sydney
man for making the first century in interprovincial
matches. When Moses was 97, in his Adelaide innings,

when Giffen clean bowled Moses. Donnan ought to hand
that trophy to Moses.

Had Newell taken Lyons’ easy chance when the
litter had made four, N.S. Wales would probably have
beaten S.A. with an innings to spare. Lyons made 120
after that, and never played hett r cricket, but the writer
awards the palm to Reedman, who made his 73 by the
b >st cricket of the match. Ad laidiana have prophesied
fir years that young R'edman will be another Giffen.
Pierce was very popular in Adelaide, and his two great
wickets—Giffen and Lyons, both clean bowled—almost
mike him a candidate for England.

When a hot favourite just wins down Melbourne

hope of “bluffing” the usually dunder-headed local

stituted a black-list of would-be-bluffing layers, who are
to be taught to pay out sans trickery. •

about the “cancerous growth of the totalisator . . .

The wholesale “tightening of girths” in the
straight by owners and trainers when the horses are on
their way to the post is one of the most interesting
features of Melbourne race-meetings. It is suggested
that when such tightening is necessary, the horses—there
are generally half-a-dozen of them, or more-should
return to the paddock, where the revised saddling could
be done in the presence of a steward.

training Ben Bolt for the Caulfield Cup, died last week.

The defeat of N.S.W. through inability to get
the South Australians out for a moderate score at the
second try, recalls to mind a performance of Shaw and
Shrewsbury’s crowd against the Fifth Australian Eleven.
It was their first match on the Melbourne ground, and
the Britishers looked like being 80 runs to the bad on the
first innings. “ Will you save the ‘follow?’ ” asked some-
body of Billy Bates. “ No,” said the Yorkshireman, “we
shall go in again and set them about 150 runs to win, and
they won’t do it on the wicket.” The Britishers accord-
ingly followed on and left the others some 175 runs to
get. The wicket crumbled just a little, as anticipated,
and the Australians were beaten by 60 or 70.

About 35 ladies and the same number of gentle-

deliberately blew off a great squirt of steam and red
boiler-rust over the group, and nearly three dozen new
frocks and hats were irretrievably ruined on the spot,
also sundry suits,umbrellas and sundries. The bill will
come in to the company when the festive season is over.

John L. Sullivan, now suffering from heart-

pug who has wasted his chances.

The referee’s decision in favour of Griffo, when
the fight, at Sydney, between him and the Victorian

The Bulletin hereby records its opinion that
if there were an election to-morrow for a President of the
Australian Republic, the men who would have the best
show would be cricketer Lyons, Harry Rickards, Donald
Wallace, Carbine, Peter Jackson, Maggie Moore, Slavin,
the principal footballer of the moment, and the champion
sculler, with an outside show for “ Tattersall.”

There are two separate morals connected with
the last great boating disaster (that of Boxing Day) on
Sydney Harbour. The boat that capsized was loaded
with a “ religious picnic according to a survivor the
craft was ballasted with hibles, and the object was to land
here and there and have “short meetings,” with some
mild amusement afterwards. They made their first land-
ing at Watson’s Bay, but an “ old gentleman ” warned
them off, as the place was private property, and being
thus ejected they started for Middle Harbour—and sank
on the way. If past Governments hadn’t sold the fore-
shon sof the harbour—a thing which no Government had
any right to do—no “ old gentleman ” could send any
boat load of well-meaning people to sudden destruction ;
the deceased excursionists’ blood rests partly on the head
of the State and partly on that of the “old gentleman.”
And if they hadn’t been a religious excursion they would
probably have sworn at and heaved clods after the “ old
gentleman ” and declined to shift, in which case they
might be alive to this day.

An excited correspondent writes to inform
The Bulletin, among other things, that an
Australian Governor died of leprosy. The only
part of his letter which can be published without
fear of the sheriff is as follows :
Dear Bulletin, — I think you have squashed the courdley
slither to the Argentine, now i would like to see you
bring your No. II down on the leperland shugar industry
in spite of bad spelling and gramer what i said before
about the handling of the shugar at the mills was correct,
leperosy is a very common disease among kanakas, owing
to their skins being black the first signes of it are not
easily detected. Kanakas being used to the disease can
spot signes of leperosy where a white doctor would take
his oath it did not exist, in fact, docter kow noting about
it. i enclose clipping in proff of this, when a kanaka in
his own country shows the slightest taint of this disease
his neighbours compell him or her to go with the first
blackbirder that comes alonge. when he arives
in Queenland a galoot called a docter glances at
him and passes him as being in excellent health,
he then starts to work the caine in course of time he
starts droping to pieces he is then sent to sew sugar bags
bag shugar and other light jobes and so the horroFis
spread and the Q. N. Bank pays big dives, why don’t the
people of Australasia put a prohibitive duty on leperland
shugar why not grow beetroot and make their own
shugar. it would be to their self-intrest and health to do
so. It is a common rummer in lepperland that (£5OOO
worth of libel is here omitted. -Ed. Bulletin.) Also it is
rumerd that governor (Another large libel cut out. —
Ed. B.) Both of them suiscided. The other day i was
talking to a chinee publican he is married to a white
wooman. an of his halfcast kids came out of a chinee
store eating fruit the ohow publican snatched the fruit
and slung it in the gutter and gave the kid a beeting. i
asked him what he don it for this is the reason he gave
as far as i could understand his gibberish, since the
poletak was put on chows they in revenge have been
spreading the leperosy among the whites, the way
they do this the chows here recieve consignments of
leper virus from china done up in small airtight pack-
ages. this they spread on fruit bread clothing or anything
they sell to the whites, the chinee cooks use a great deal
of it. if what this chinee publican told me is true in a
short time the strangest sight in Australia will be to see a
white person untainted with the leperosy. nearly all the
goods hawke by coloured hawkers about the country are
the products of persons suffering from disease leperosy or
other diseases, nearly all the indian and chinee silk is
maide by lepers the making of silk being light work.
Some interesting particulars about a politician
who sold his sister to a Chinaman are held over.
M. Abaza, the new President of the
Council of Russia, was “ Mabel Grey’s ” final and
most devoted lover. He spent a fortune on the
beautiful mondaine, and buried her, and kisses a
lock of her hair once a week regularly. Mabel
Grey ! the first English girl to be photographed in
a hundred different attitudes, and sold at a shil-
ling a time. Precious bad photographs they used
to be in those days, too. We once bought a
shillingsworth of Mabel ourself, and comparing
her with the modern photos., consider she was
dear at the price.

“IT IS THREE THOUSAND MILES
LONG.”
We allude to the great Mississippi River in
America. For hundreds of miles of its course it
is yellow with the earth which the swift current
has torn from its banks . Probably the Missis-
sippi bears constantly in solution ground enough
to make many a rich farm, though the amount is,
of course, greater at times of flood. Thus, for
drinking, and even for washing, the water of the
Mississippi must first be purified.
It is the same with anything which either for
appearance or utility is in some way thrown out
of character. For instance, the blood in our body
is a river. From the heart to the extremities it is
of a bright red colour, but on its return through
the veins it is dark and sluggish. The reason is
that when it starts from the heart it has just been
purified, and when it comes back it is loaded with
all sorts of refuse matter it has picked up in its
journey. In other words, the blood —which is
only food fully digested—carries life on its red
current and brings away disease and death on its
dark one.
Speaking of her own condition at a period about
six years since, a woman writes that her skin
gradually became first yellow and then of a saffron
colour. Connected with this she experienced
several symptoms of illness. She had more or less
pain at the sides and considerable difficulty in
breathing. Her appetite, previously good, began
to fail, and after eating comparatively little, there
was much distress in the region of the stomach.
There was. an attendant loss of energy, both of
mind and body, and she felt tired, languid, and
weak.
Now we must observe that in case of natural
fatigue from labour or any exertion rest is an
unfailing remedy. Sleep and relaxation renew
our powers. But there is a kind of fatigue which
rest does not relieve—for which the Angel of
Sleep bears no healing on his wings. What vile
counterfeit is it ?
She adds : “ I finally took to my bed and was
visited by a doctor, who said my liver was wrong,
and that I had jaundice. He gave me medicine,
but as it had no good effect he advised me to go
to the hospital. As I objected to this, he said I
might try a change of air and see what that would
do for me. So I gave up my place and went to
my home at Fairford, in Gloucestershire. Fail-
ing to obtain any benefit from the change, I con-
sulted another physician, who attended me for
some time, but I grew no better. Whatever I did
I could not recover my strength, and my friends
thought I was in a decline.
“1 did not eat enough to feed a bird, and began
to despair of ever recovering my health. With
many ups and downs in the way of feeling, and of
fear and hope, I lingered along until July, 1890,
when an acquaintance recommended me to try
Mother Seigel’s Syrup. Indeed, so much was I
impressed with what was said about this medicine
that I sent my niece four miles to procure a bottle
of it. After taking the contents I felt better. A
weight seemed to be lifted from my chest, my
relish for food returned, and by degrees I found
myself in every way stronger. I will conclude by
saying that after having used two bottles more of
the Syrup I was able to return to Birmingham
quite well, and have had no signs of the ailment
since. It is only just to mention that I feel better
now than I have done for many years, and had I
sooner known of Mother Seigel’s Syrup I should
have avoided an amount of suffering and misery
which it saddens me even to look back upon.”
The lady referred to is Miss Sarah Hawkes, of
the “Lion Inn,” Longmore-street, Birmingham.
That yellow or saffron colour of the blood was
caused by the failure of the liver to secrete, or
take away, the bile from the blood. Remaining
in the blood it was carried to all parts of the body,
and necessarily showed itself through the skin in
the ghastly hue she names.
Understand, please, that the bile, useful to help
move the bowels, is a poison when in the blood.
The entire malady of biliousness in all its forms
is’ a symptom of indigestion and dyspepsia, the
source of most of our aches, pains, and diseases.
It is no new thing to say that the success of
Mother Seigel’s Syrup in reviving the torpid
digestion, stimulating the liver, and thus purify-
ing the blood, sets it apart from all other medicines
as an article to be relied upon when the use of
ordinary drugs has been followed only by disap-
pointment. The blood holds the secret of life,
and this remedy keeps that ruby river clear and
clean.
He Bought a Horse.
“ My dear,” began Mr. Cityman, as he entered
his suburban home the other evening in apparently
high spirits, “ I did a good stroke of business to-
day.’' “Indeed! And what was that?” archly
inquired Mrs. C., with a well-meant though un-
successful attempt to appear interested. “Noth-
ing short of a dead bargain. lam going to utilise
the old stable where the fowls are housed, and I
mean to ride into town every day. It will benefit
my health, and I won’t have to hang around the
streets waiting for a ’bus.” “So you have
bought a horse, then?” was the acid rejoinder.
“Of course I have; you don’t suppose I’d buy a
donkey, or a mule, or a dromedary, or a locomo-
tive, or ” “ Well,” broke in Mrs. C., in con-
ciliatory tones, “I didn’t know that you could
manage a horse, and besides I should have thought
’’ “Oli, certainly,” snapped out Mr. City-
man, “ you’re always thinking instead of making
sure. But when you see me coming in after
a rattling good canter you’ll change your tune.
I tell you this horse is a beauty, and no mistake,
quiet as a child, no vice about him, good pacer,
and warranted not to shy or cut up capers.”
Early the following morning the steed was
brought home and handed over, and the proud
owner, after several desperate tries, finally
succeeded in climbing into the saddle and set oil
for town. There was no wind to speak of that day,
and a small boy on the wayside was frantically
endeavouring to persuade a recalcitrant kite into
a recognition that it was destined for a nobler
career than scraping up road metal, when a spry
horse_ and a perspiring, doubled-up equestrian
hove in sight. There was a busy, exciting time for
about three minutes during which the air was
filled with profanity and buttons and things, and
then a riderless horse might be seen ambling
peacefully down the road as if nothing had
happened. Mr. Cityman took the next ’bus home,
where he humbly submitted himself for repairs.
These his wife soon effected with the aid of a
valuable family remedy always kept in stock by
her. The next day a horse was advertised “for
sale, cheap,” and Mr. C., while distinctly dis-
claiming all desire to “make an advertisement of
himself,” felt bound to admit that his wife was
right again when she preached the doctrine that
St. Jacobs Oil, for the absolute relief and cure of
contusions, sprains, and bruises, knows no rival.

Here at Last!
Some seven years ago a strange thing happened to the lady
whose photo, appeals herewith, whereby she became
-A. MYSTERY
Which no one can explain or account for so far, not even her
husband. How it happened was this : She lay dying of a compli-
cation of diseases ; often she Would faint off, and lie unconscious
as long as 30 hours at a stretch—frigid as a corpse and apparently
dead. The leading medical men of Melbourne were in attendance,
often at a cost of Five Guineas a day, yet she sank lower and
lower. Everything that medical science could suggest was trh d ;
even morphia failed to give enough ease for two hours' sleep
dail3'. At last, in desperation, some said, “ Try Mesmerism.”
Mr. Harle, as a Mesmerist,
Had been very successful on the public platform, and had also
saved life by private magnetic treatment; hut Mrs, Harle, being
a lady of very pronounced opinions and strong mind of her own”
never could see anything in it but a hobby of bis, and so, whe.a
urged,to try it, she ridiculed the very idea; but they said, “ r l'ify
it for sleep only— you will go mad for want of rest.” For a ibngr
time she could not bring her mind to submit ; at last, afl.i-rnimcli
prayer to God for guidance and help, she was willing to try.
After about half an hour’s mesmeric influence and passrs, she-
went off into a peaceful hypnotic state, which lasted,/us’ vv.ns*
intended, from eight at night till ten next morning; land sire
awoke rested and refreshed. The experiment was repeated, wheii>

Mrs. J. N. HARLEM
To find that, whilst to all intents and purposes she was. iisir-fp,. yet* .in another sense, the mind was far more awake,
and she commenced talking about what the servant was doing om the" ground floor, what an acquaintance was doing a
mile away, what was happening in the home of a dear faiend. some few blocks away, and so forth. Then she was
requested to look into her own body ; this she did, amd was surprised! herself, and surprised everyone else, by tracing
the cause of her trouble, which proved to be mainly an internal canoe r. She then told them how to cure her.
Crowds of Friends Came; to See Her,
For she had a large and influential circle of acquaintances*. She astotmded all by her marvellous powers of vision—
to see into their bodies as if they were made of transparent glass, tcftsee the members of their families, to know all
about their commercial affairs, seemed quite easy to her ; England,. America, New Zealand, etc., seemed just like next
door.
The Sensatiom. was Immense!
Drawing-room, Sitting-room, Dining-room and Bedroom w(Bre crowded wifth inquisitive people, and the invalid became
a phenomenon. The doctors were nonplussed with their (patient- she gaire directions how to soften the cancer to the
lancing state: this was done ; then, as they dare not givalchlorofttrm onaccourit of her heart, Mr. Harle put her under
mesmerism, whilst Drs. Teague, of Collins Street, lanced/ifc. She awoke without having felt anything that had hap-
pened. Everyone said: “ Start and use your powers forrdbing;good, you can
Save laves- toy; Thousands.”
But her health was too low. First, she cured herself— in? three months’ time she was again taking her accustomed
drives on the Esplanade, in her phaeton, to the astonishment of the whole district. To properly tone the system a
change of climate was needed, and she came to N.S., Wales,. For a shorfctime she resided in Maitland ; her retreat
was known by those who were aware of her powers,.and shegot no peace till she agreed to start practice. Five years
ago Mrs. Harle opened in Newcastle ; three have been spent travelling in the Northern district,
and away in the bush discovering gold andlshe secure to be able to find gold as easy as trace disease.
Seven Thousand PeopKs Have Consulted Her
In her mesmeric state ; come about business, but most abomt their health. Not one can say: “I am worse fbr your
treatment,” whilst all who have followed the advicaand treatment, rejoice*in restored health. Mrs. Harle describes
■ach diseased organ, folds the cause of every trouble, and prescribes remedies and treatment. Her wonderful mental
vision or clear sight pnables.her, to see just what medicine, and how longjit will take to cure it, often giving the
medicine three rqpnths ahead,, and never changing a bottle.
Warning!
If you wish to mortally offend Mrs. Harle, just class her alongv with the card-reading, palm-scanning, fbrtune-telling
crowd, and Ihe task is,done. No such rubbish. 1 ! Mrs. Harle isimesmerised by ther husband, and when in the hypnotic
state, she sees with her mind. She cannot open her eyes, yetsshe hears, talks,tasks and answers questions, etc. When
the mesmerism,is,updone,, she awakes, and knows no more of l what has happened, than if she had been chloroformed
or dead.
It Causes a Territole .mental Strain,
Therefore,, Mr. Harle reserves the right to say whemshe has done enough, and may refuse any or all at such times.
The Fee is halfca-guinea for bodily examination,i and a guinea for business advice. The half-guinea, includes a

and more satisfaction all round than can possibly be obtained by any other means whatever. Special medicine is
prepared for each case treated. Mrs. Harle is prepared to work with the family physician or any qualified medical
nan, if her suggestions are carried out. She is prepared to treat any case that can*be cured,* hut insists upon only
using her Eclectic Botanic Remedies-she has no faith in mineral medicines. It is desirable to make appointments- or

Dr. Parker has a few idiotic remarks about
tobacco in a late Idler. “No dog smokes,” he
says. “No bird pines for tobacco. No horse is a
member of a pipe club.” Which reminds us that
it is only the yahoo and not the other animal
(we forget how to spell him) that goes to church.
Is that an argument against religion ?
The new Masonic temple, Chicago, is 300
feet high—a square building, 18 stories, cost
£1,100,000; electric lighted on the Houston sys-
tem, 00 miles of wire, 7000 lights. Yet the
Chicago Oddfellows have begun their head-quar-
ters, to take the shine out of the Masons, with a
buildinglike a telescope drawn out, in three parts,
and the topmost is 33 stories high.
Melbourne Evening Standard recently
had a flaring heading about the discovery of the
man to whom the “legs’’ belonged; besides a
vivid account of how a certain blind man could
tell by feeling them whether they were the right
ones or not. This took up three-quarters of a
column, and then a little footnote was added—
“ Later : We find that the man to whom it was
alleged the missing legs belonged is in Geelong
Gaol.”
The Batavia River in the Gulf of Carpen-
taria, on the upper reaches of which there is at
present a small gold rush, may claim, writes a
Bulletin correspondent, to be the historic river
of Australia. In all probability it was the first
spot on the continent to witness the landing of
the Europeans, and the death of some of their
number. In the oldest Dutch maps extant, thq.
place on the coast where its mouth is situated is
marked with the words “Fresh water,” In
corroboration of this, it is the only river in the
Gulf that boats could easily enter, and obtain
fresh water if they went high enough. For a
certain part of its course, towards the head of
navigation, it is one of the most beautiful rivers in
Australasia. The banks are lined with a kind of
dwarf palm and one appears to be sailing up a
lovely tropical avenue. Near the head of naviga-
tion the river broadens out into a wide reach in
which are several palm-fringed islets. Jungle-
covered hills then obtrude on the banks, and boats
cannot go much higher. Here, at the time of the
writer’s visit in 1883, the water was quite fresh,
although there had not been any recent flood.
Sharks, alligators and blacks were then present
in large numbers, but whatever may have hap-
pened to them since, it is to be hoped the palms
have not been destroyed. The river empties into
a fairly sheltered bay of some size, with a, bar of
about two fathoms.
More of the troubles of a Sunday news-
paper. The other day the proprietors and the
ex-editor of Sydney Truth were proceeded against
by an indignant female, who claimed that they
had hired her to remove a possible witness in the
recent libel-case of Black v. Norton, and keep her
out of the way till the trouble was over. The
witness averred that she' was “suppressed”
accordingly, but the firm apparently didn’t pay up,
consequently the lady sued for her money and
didn’t get it. In the course of the proceedings,
the allegedly suppressed person testified that she
had been kept for three days locked in an office,
so the next trouble will probably arise when
she sues the man who owns that office for
damages on account of illegal confinement, &c.
Moreover, the ex-editor, who has also been suing
the proprietary of late without much success, and
who is alleged to have left the newspaper rather
suddenly—head first, apparently—gave his support
to the plaintiff and tried to get her a verdict
against his former bosses, and this seems likely to
lead to further complications. Still, the paper
owes a debt of gratitude to ex-editor Norton.
That gentleman was formerly the sole registered
proprietor of Truth, and as such accepted the
service of all writs. Therefore, when Socialist
Rosa sued the paper for libel damages Mr. Norton
—then freshly sacked—if he had been a vengeful
and malicious individual, might have appeared
as sole defendant, and slanged the judge and
the jury and brutally insulted the plaintiff and
made a hog of himself generally, till the court lost
its temper and gave Rosa .£lOOO damages. Mean
while the real proprietors, whose property would
have to satisfy the damages, could have been left
to foam impotently in the background ; not being
registered they could do nothing but gibber help-
lessly in court while Norton harangued away their
plant and machinery and thus got level for the in
dignities put upon him. And when Crick,
M.L.A., as one of the principal owners of Truth,
“appeared for the defendant,” which defendant
was nominally Norton but really himself, the
dummy proprietor could have put down the
real proprietor in one act, if he had been un-
generous enough to do so, and simply told him to
get out as he had been given no authority what-
ever to appear, and so had no more to do with the
case than Black Jackson has to do with the Young
Women’s Christian Association. Also, he might,
if both parties had been wicked enough, have
agreed to go shares with plaintiff Rosa in the
damages, and then the plaintiff and defendant
could have sold up Truth between them and gone
on a picnic with the proceeds. An unforgiving
and unprincipled man, in ex-edifor Norton’s
situation, might have had a pleasant spree with
Crick and Co.’s assets, and have enjoyed flu-
additional satisfaction of Seeing' a prominent
politician in a fit —brought 'on by ' smothered
indignation—on the floor of tlie court-house; and
the firm doesn’t seem to be half as grateful as it
ought to be for his forbearance.


“August
Flower”
For two years I suffered terribly
with stomach trouble, and was for
all that time under treatment by a
physician. He finally, after trying
everything, said stomach was about
worn out, and that I would have to
cease eating solid food for a time at
least. I was so weak that I could
not work. Finally on the recom-
mendation of a friend who had used
your preparations
with beneficial re-
sults, I procured a
bottle of August
Flower, and com-
menced using it. It seemed to do
me good at once. I gained in
strength and flesh rapidly; my ap-
petite became good, and I suffered
no bad effects from what I ate. I
feel now like a new man, and con-
sider that August Flower has en-
tirely cured me of Dyspepsia in its
worst form. James B. Dederick,

A man who held 1000 nominally-paid-up shares
in the Lode Hill N.S.W. Mining Co., and had been placed
on the list of contributories, last week was told by the
N.S.W. Supreme Court that he must stay there—that as
he had not paid the company cash for the shares the
decision must stand, unless it could be shown that a con-
tract had been filed with the Registrar of Joint Stock
Companies which specified the consideration (other than
cash) for which the shares had been issued. This sound
principle has long been widely understood in English
business circles.

The official opposition to the proposal for a line
of penny ’busses from the railway-station to Hunter-
street, Sydney, in opposition to the ’Bus Co.’s present 3d.
line, smacks strongly of jobbery. There is going to be a
penny line, and all the underground engineering in the
world won’t prevent it. It won’t hurt the cabmen, any
more than the present 3d. ’bus system hurts them. It
will only hurt that amiable corporation the Sydney ’Bus
Do.

kad debts. Why not, then, abolish credit? This is the
crucial point. This is where the Hebrew, and that worse
Shylook, the Gentile usurer, come in. To abolish credit
would mean to abolish usury, to abolish shent-per-shent,
and to abolish the ca. sa. and the ca. re. that whisks the

When the Cosmopolitan battery, worked by a water-

correspondent wired thus to a Sydney paper: “Cosmo-
politan battery opened to-day—great attendance—liberal
hospitality—Pelton wheel giving great satisfaction—
expected greatly reduce working expenses—success
assured.” Which, when duly “packed,” was published
thus: “The Cosmopolitan battery was opened to-day,
under most favourable auspices. The attc dance was
large, and a sumptuous banquet was provided by the
management for all comers, champagne flowing freely.
The manager, Mr. Pelton Wheel, is giving great satisfac-
tion, and it is confidently expected,” &c.

Batavia River (Q.) rush seems practically over.
The old story. Gold only a flash in the pan, and located
in a trackless, snake-haunted waste with 1001 b. pressure
of fever and centipedes to the sq. inch. The miners mak-
ing for the new field dropped by the steamer on a hideously
mountainous region thickly covered with bush ; most of
them lost before they had got a mile from the coast.
Some of them found again by accident; the bones of
the rest will be gathered up in a shovel at the Day of
Judgment. Most who reached the field got there
famished, rag-clad, and hopeless; they met with no sem-
blance of luck when they arrived, and how they will get
back neither they nor anybody else appears to know.

Some Broken Hill miners have made “big
money ’’ by contracting, and the other side is asking
where the hardship comes in ? It comes in through the
long waits between contracts that reduce average
earnings, and through the sweating and squeezing down
that will be gradually adopted. As the Barrier Miner
puts it: “It is as unfair to reckon weekly earnings from
the sum earned on any contract as to set down the
earnings of a jockey who wins £5O in five minutes at
£28,800 fora working week of eight hours daily.”

Where but in N.S.W. would a mine be shut

For the third time within a month an
intelligent - looking, resjiectably - dressed young-
woman has figured before the Newcastle (N.S.W.)
Bench. She was, in the first instance, charged
with being of unsound mind, her peculiar habit
of haunting a local bank, at which she was but
lately a servant, leading to her arrest. She used
to amble timidly into the bank and ask to see the
manager, who, she said, had promised to marry
her. After examination, the Government medical
officer pronounced her perfectly sane, and she was
accordingly discharged. For a few days she lay
low. One busy morning, however, she meandered
into the bank, and yearningly implored the
accountant to produce the manager. An unsym-
pathetic clerk passed her out and shut the inner
glass doors of the institution upon her. She
thereupon closed the outer doors on the
public and then sobbed hysterically upon the
window - sill in the porch. Scenes of this
character were enacted daily till a police-
man “lumbered her on the vag.” A conscien-
tious Bench, however, refused to send her to
gaol, and she was once more set free to urge her
suit upon the manager. For a week she daily
appeared at the bank, and with most uncom-
fortable pertinacity daily asked to see the official.
Mostly she didn’t see him. Her manner was un-
obtrusively determined, and she suffered many
unworthy indignities at the hands of the gentle-
manly clerks. Once more the zeal of the New-
castle policeman asserted itself, and she was again
cleverly arrested “on the vag.” In court" she
olearlv and succinctly explained her proceedings,
but the police evidence was too powerful, and,
having neither money, friends, nor situation, she
was sent up for two months with hard labour.
The “ law must be upheld.”

Then he beguiled them to a house near the station,
seized upon their clothes, which he took to be

Consider the dynamite horror, how it

D.T. on the recent explosion in Dublin
The outrage is regarded as a protest against the
Government for their determination not to release the
Fenian Daly. It is believed that the bomb which
exploded was aimed at and intended for the destruction
of Dublin Castle. The Standard expresses the opinion
that the outrage should convince Mr. Morley of the
futility of any attempt to conciliate the Irish people.
Now, in the first place, there is absolutely no
evidence to show that the bomb was deposited by
an Irishman—it might have been planted by a
Scotchman or an Englishman, a Tory spy of the “Le
Caron ” order, a lunatic, or anybody else. There is
no possible evidence to show that it was a protest
against the Government resolve not to release
Daly—it might as easily have been the protest of
a girl who wanted to get square with the police-
man who seduced and deserted her. And there
doesn’t even seem to be any solid evidence that
the explosion arose through a bomb at all ; the
only man who appears to have seen the bomb is
the one who was killed, and therefore nobody
knows whether he saw it or not; and when once a
bomb has exploded it is difficult to find enough of
it to identify even under a microscope. From
this distance, the affair looks like a British Kiama
Ghost, with the Tory Press playing the cart of
Parkes.
People suffering fx-om swollen head can get
their photographs enlarged for nothing in Aus-
tralia, nowadays. Messrs. Blank and Dash,
artists, are much impressed with the personal
appearance of Mrs. Asterisk, and they would be
greatly obliged if she would kindly allow them to
enlarge her photograph, free of expense. In
return, perhaps, she would be good enough, when
showing the work of art to the distinguished
circle in which she moves, to mention the name of
the firm. A lot of yellow-haired aristocrats rush
wildly to the studio of the polite Blank and Dash
waving their photographs voluminously and call-
ing upon the artists to enlarge them. The
firm rises and gently explains that it is absolutely
necessary that the portraits when enlarged should
be surrounded by a frame which will match the
. delicate tints of the apotheosized pictures, so as
to do full justice to both sitter and artist. By a
curious coincidence they alone are the happy
proprietors of such frames, and by another curious
coincidence they sell them at three or four
times the price charged by ordinary dealers.
About this time the would-be patrons begin to
think that there is more expense.in the thing than
meets the eye, and, if they are wise, they promise
to call again. The foolish virgins don’t : they sit
down quickly and write out the order. And that
is how you can get your photo, enlarged gratis.
Four evictions took place near Newcastle,
N.S.W., last week. The tenants of four houses,
which had been sub-let to them, refused to pay
rent to the first lessor, who thereupon entered by
legal process, passed the furniture outside, and
then razed the rickety shanties to the ground.
Three of the evicted gathered their belongings
under their arras and sadly sought the shelter of
some neighbour’s houses. The fourth simply
erected his scattered bed on the footpath, and,
though it was but four in the afternoon, turned
in. Sympathetic friends gathered round and pre-
vented him feeling either lonely or thirsty.
The greater part of the night was spent in heed-
less jocund fashion, singing songs, playing cards
and swilling beer. He slept till 10.30 the next
morning, at which hour a hireling of the local
Council roughly woke him, and ordered him to
move on. Contemptuously ignoring the command,
he turned defiantly on his other side and started
out on his second sleep. The Council’s man
forthwith got a cart, tumbled the recalcitrant
footpath-tenant into the kennel, placed his belong-
ings in the vehicle, and removed them to a spare
room in the Town Chambers. The owner sur-
reptitiously rejoined his furniture, placed it in
order, and once more turned into his bed, from
which he was, a few hours after, ignominiously
ejected by an irate Mayor. He and his furniture
are now divorced.

Horsford’s Cemetery.
( FOR THE BULLETIN .)
About a hundred miles beyond the
Warrego, in a south-westerly direction, and upon
the dip of one of the long, extended ridges whose
sides, no doubt, at one time stemmed the spread
of swirling torrents which rushed and gathered
from the higher country outback, could be seen, in
the year 1879, a rectangular piece of ground about
half-an-aore in extent and absolutely devoid of
vegetation.
Season in and season out, its barren surface lay
red and unblinking in the glaring sun, and when
the pent-up storms of sultry summer, or the
piercing rains of winter sought to moisten its dry
lips, as though to revive the animation so strangely
dormant or quenched, the glittering drops would
roll off into the surrounding verdure, like bitter
tears of grief from the lashes of old age.
Especially in good' seasons, when the wild
“blue’’-grass stood feet high round its square
edges, did the remarkable barrenness of the small
patch attract the curiosity of the traveller ; for
then it appeared as though an immense sod had
been cut cleanly out and the earth beneath effectu-
ally sterilised for ever. The Warrego old hands
called the spot “ Horsford’s Cemetery ’’-—and,
indeed, the little stream about a quarter of a mile
distant from it is still known as “Cemetery
Creek.”
Early in ’6l a large tract of country was taken
up by one Oscar Horsford, from the Victorian
side, and upon this very spot he settled and built
his homestead. He was a consummate bushman,
who could ride anything lapped in hide, and had
few equals on a cattle-camp. He must have made
much money in a very short time, during magni-
ficent seasons when cattle were worth .£lO to =Bl5
per head. The one thing Horsford had to contend
with was the blacks, who worried his stock all
over the run. In revenge, he would shoot them
down at every chance; few indeed were the
months that passed without his sending one or
two to their last account. But, as things over the
border grew easier for the dark men, they
gradually drifted that way for free rations and
rum, and, after a few years, Horsford’s losses had
much diminished with the migration of his dusky
enemies. Now and then, however, they would
make a fresh raid upon him, generally leaving
some of their number to bleach on the run as a
penalty for the diversion. The consequence of all
this was that at last he swore to exterminate them
root and branch. Eew, and very accidental, were
the opportunities he missed of endeavouring to
fulfil his vow—his hatred growing in direct ratio
to their rapidly decreasing numbers.
* * *
About the end of ’63, Horsford journeyed
South and brought back a wife —a gentle, con-
sumptive-looking little thing, daughter of Everett,
a Darling River squatter. This had the effect of
making his expeditions against the enemy fewer ;
but his hatred abated not one jot. The unfor-
tunate half-civilised black who visited the home-
stead and trustingly asked for work or rations,
was taken out along the run for a few miles and
remorselessly shot down. Even for the gins and the
piccaninnies at their breasts there was no mercy.
When Mrs. Horsford left the Darling she was
followed by a half-caste native boy named
“Woolly,” born and reared on her father’s station,
and who, having been associated with her from his
earliest infancy, was most powerfully devoted to
her. He turned up at Horsford’s a day or two
after her arrival. She almost cried with pleasure
when his grinning face peered in at the dairy door,
and she determined that henceforth he should
live on the run. At that time he was about four-
teen years of age, and the newly-wedded Horsford,
out of consideration for his bride, tolerated the
boy’s presence ; presently he even began to take
him about and teach him many a “wrinkle” of
station life.
» * *
Three years passed away, and the Hors-
fords’ little son was now a couple of years old.
The station hands, a rough and lawless set,
amongst whom Woolly, a strapping fellow, was a
general favourite, numbered about a dozen.
Besides the mistress, an old, decrepid woman was
the only female about the place. The men of late
had been bitterly murmuring amongst themselves
at the number of unfortunate blacks of both sexes
whom the “boss” had “accompanied ” down the
run; and threats madewould undoubtedly havebeen
carried into effect only for the restraining influ-
ence of Woolly, and for the sake of the gentle
wife whose kindness had endeared her to the
stockmen.
But the final tragedy was near.
The annual cattle-camp was formed at which
all hands were present. Towards the end of a
heavy day’s cutting-out a bullock made straight at
Horsford who, turning his horse, tried to get
away. But the bullock was too fast, and over-
hauling the fugitives stuck his short horns fair
between the horse’s hind legs, twisting him right
over—steer, horse, and rider being quickly mixed
up on the ground. Woolly and others quickly
came along and extricated Horsford, who hap-
pened to be but little hurt by the fall, perceiving
which fact Woolly gave vent to his pent-up
laughter at the ludicrousness of the situation.
Blacks were not privileged to laugh at Horsford,
who at once savagely attacked the boy with his
whip. The men interfered, matters calmed down,
and in a few days Woolly had nearly forgotten
the incident. But not so Horsford.
* * *
The squatter having determined to dig a
tank about 30 miles from the homestead started
out one day, accompanied by Woolly, to pick a
spot, leaving instructions that all hands were
to follow, which they next day did. Horsford
had made a camp on a pine-ridge, and was alone
when the men arrived. The day having passed
without any re-appearance of Woolly the men
asked Horsford where he was. The squatter
replied that Woolly had returned to the home-
stead by the creek track to fetch some things they
had forgotten. A significant glance passed round,
and when Horsford, having laid out the spot for
the tank, had started for home, they held a
hurried confabulation and came to the firm con-
clusion that poor Woolly had gone for ever.
Teddy Barbour, who could track a mosquito
through mallee scrub, packed off to see what he
could discover, while Abe Keys went back towards
the homestead by the creek track to see if what
Horsford had said was true ; but he only rode a
few miles, and, having seen no tracks whatever,
turned back and reported matters to the camp.
Towards dusk Barbour returned, and silently
leading the men along the ridge for about a mile,
and then turning into some low scrubby flats
showed them Woolly’s corpse, which he had
dragged out of a water-hole.
The poor wretch had been shot through the
head, evidently from behind. The men cursed
with rage and suggested immediate vengeance by
going back and lynching Horsford; but Keys
opened out a plan which seemed to meet the
approval of his vengeful mates, and which they
instantly set about carrying into effect. Keys
started back to the homestead, the other men
went back to the camp, and next day set quietly
to work building the gunyahs and starting the
tank.
» * *
Next night Horsford appeared at the
camp with ; “Where are the blacks camped that
Keys rode back to tell me about ? ”
“ Glory ” Moore ventured to lead the way, but
suggested early morning as the best time to make
the attack, to which Horsford agreed. After
supper they were all lounging round the fire when
the crackling of underwood was followed by the
appearance of a little piccaninny with his hand in
his mouth, coming towards the camp. The men
jumped up, and Horsford, drawing his revolver,
took deliberate aim and fired at the little thing,
which by that time was not more than fifteen
paces off. It rolled over without a sound or
struggle. Two or three of the men professed to
be shocked at the inhumanity of the deed, which
only caused Horsford to anathematise the black
race generally. Had Horsford used his eyes and
ears, he would have noticed the excited undertone
in which the men were speaking, and would have
seen them pull Keys’ red handkerchief out of the
dead child’s mouth. However, they threw the
corpse into the bushes, and after a short recon-
naissance, resumed their places at the fire. Ten
minutes later, Keys rode up, and, after supper,
joined the circle. Soon all turned in save
Barbour, who was told off to keep watch for the
first stretch.
Three hours later, the camp presented a strange
scene. Two of the men were engaged in washing
the grime from the face of the supposed picca-
ninny while the others were stripping Woolly’s
fast-decomposing corpse of its coverings. These
tasks completed, Keys, with cat-like tread, stole
with both bodies into Horsford’s gunyah, and
emerged again without having disturbed the
occupant. Then they all moved towards the
rough horseyard, whence, ten minutes later, a
cavalcade issued and moved westward.
# * *
The grey mom peered into Horsford’s
gunyah and awoke the sleeper. He sat up in his
blankets and rubbed his eyes ; then with a hoarse
cry he involuntarily seized his pistol. On either
side of the gunyah’s doorway was standing a
stark corpse. That of Woolly he instantly recog-
nised —but the other—“ God Almighty!” he
cried, running towards it. He left the gunyah,
revolver in hand, and strode into the men’s
camp. It was empty! He emerged and looked
around. No living man, no horse was to
be seen. The whole truth instinctively flashed on
him. There he was, over 30 miles from home
without the means of getting back, the corpses of
his two victims the sole companions of his double
solitude! He dropped down and groaned and
wept aloud, every tear making a white track over
the blackened body of his infant. Then he put
on his hat, and pressing the corpse of his child to
his breast started with mad strides towards the
distant homestead. A gruesome catafalque bear-
ing a ghastly burden.
# * *
At ten o’clock that night Mrs. Horsford,
who was nearly dead with weakness increased by
distraction at the unaccountable disappearance of
her child, was suddenly confronted by the be-
grimed and haggard figure of her husband with
the corpse in his arms. By nature’s mercy she
saw it but a second and fell forward on the floor
clutching at the carpet, whde the bright pink
blood gushed from her mouth and nostrils. The
exhausted Horsford stood there a moment watch-
ing the warm stream that crept even unto his dusty
boots, then with a gasp of horror he fell forward
over his wife’s body, pulling the cloth from the
table and upsetting the lighted kerosene-lamp in
his fall.
* * *
Three weeks passed away —weeks of storm
and deluge. The creeks ran like huge rivers, and
most of the surrounding country was under water.
Mackinnon, the Darling Downs drover, was
making for Horsford’s to take delivery of a mob
of cattle for Horsford’s father-in-law. He reached
the head of the ridge about dark one evening,
after he and his horse had narrowly escaped
drowning, and was surprised to see no lights in
the homestead. He rode on, but to his amaze-
ment was unable to strike the house and so was
forced to camp out till morning. When daylight
came he found himself within two hundred yards
of the charred ruins of the head station.
* # *
Nothing was ever heard of the station
hands, who, it was thought by many, must have all
perished in the out-buildings of the place. But
Andy Gardiner, the Warrego drover, swears he
saw Abe Keys, or Abe’s ghost, driving a mob of
Merrigal cattle up near Palmerston during the
middle of ’7l, and if that was so there is a likeli-
hood that we may yet hear a sequel to the tale of
Horsford’s Cemetery.

A writer on “Australian Myths” in
Belgravia makes unholy hash of a number of
aboriginal legends. In the story of the creation
of water a number of animals are introduced that
the Australian blacks knew _ nothing “whatever
about. The great frog containing the water is to
be made to laugh. According to the Belgravia
writer the first creature to exhibit his low comedy
instincts is an ass. He is followed by a cock that
struts and crows. This writer grappled a splendid
subject, and might have made a fine thing of it
but for one fault—his sublime ignorance.

District Magistrate, Cuddapah (Madras,
India): “The prevalence of murder is a healthy
sign, in that it shows that the people are well fed
and their passions strong.” Wrong, Mr. Injun !
Fat, well-fed men only grab land, build bogus
banks, and “jew” you in a jolly, fat, well-fed
way ; it is the starved prey of the famine-wolf
that wreaks red revolutions —at long last. As to
sporadic murders, these are caused by revenge,
fear, jealousy, and loot, except when a maniac
starts on the bead. In wild, well-fed, populous,
but loosely-regulated and weakly-adjudicated
communities, murder is mostly self-preservation ;
but at epidemic times it becomes the rage, the
vogue, the Melbourne-Cup draw of the season.—
Dipso.
Editor Bulletin, — I have been reading
the accounts of the feats of strength by Sandow
and others. They are fairly tough. So am I.
About 26 years ago, when in my prime, I was
fencing on a Murrmnbidgee station. We had a
bullock-dray, old style, 4in. tyre, 4ft. Gin. dia.
wheel, loaded with 18 “ strainers ” (green pine
posts Bft. long, 18in. dia.) After opening a gate
to let the team through I slipped and fell. The
team walked over me (not treading on me) and
one wheel of the waggon, carrying this 5 tons of
loading, besides the weight of wheel and waggon,
passed over my chest. Not a crack nor a cry. I
got up, much to my mates’surprise, anathematised
freely, and went and shut the gate. No ill effects
then, and none since. This is correct and can be
verified. —Yours, T.S., Hay, N.S. W., 16/12/’92.
This year there will be much over a
million gallons of wine made in S.A., which sells
more wine in London than all the rest of the
Australias put together. The province locally
uses 30u,000 gal., and last year exported to
England 278,000 gal., and to Maoriland, 24,000
gal. Wiih a view to bringing about a unitorm
character in S.A. wines, are being erected
at the German village of Tan'uuda, capable of
treating a million gallons annually. The co.
owning the cellars has already under vines 2000
acres, producing 400,000 gallons. As yet, the
whole of Australia’s wine production is less than
180th of the wine consumed in London alone ! It
is proposed that the vignerons of Australia
establish a London depot, whence the wine can be
sent out without the possibility of adulteration.
P.S. —This is one of the industries which is to be
wiped right out by the prohibitionist cranks, who
will enact it a felony to make wine in Australia.
The bumps of the man whose limbs have
been scattered about Melbourne are at present
illegible, owing to the absence of his head, but an
obliging and erudite Civil servant has given the
local Hekald an exhaustive description of the
man’s character, etc., from a study of his hands.
Thus it gathered that the dismembered-absentee
was “ unintelligent, coarse, materialistic, impul-
sive, probably a bricklayer, angry, irritable,
uncertain, obstinate, violent, earthy, lazy, sensual,
ugly, a tippler, victim of a violent death, an
ordinary-minded, contented labourer, with a little
discarded hair on his face, a short, thick back,
square jaw, large eyes and no conception of
beauty and truth ; also, he bit his nails and his
lower lip ran riot.” His identity and arrest for
insulting behaviour and being illegally at large in
Victoria are now daily expected.
Dear Bulletin, —How is it that you are so mu.oh in
favour of the Afghan [The Bulletin has opposed the
Afghan ever since he appeared in Australia. —Ed. B.] dnd
the camel when you have such a dead set on Chinamen ?
Some time ago when the carriers of Bourke were agitating
against the use of camels for carrying purposes you advised
them to get cainelsf themselves and-so defeat the Afghan.
[And yet the wriwt says in the previous sentence that
The Bulletin favours the Afghan.— Ed. B.] Now, let
us suppose you had worked a lifetime carrying, and made
up a team of, say,-a dozen good horses, and you took as
much pride in them as the captain of a man-o’-war does
in his vessel. You are out on the plain with your team,
well-fed on corn and fit to go for a man’s life, when lo!
you see a string of camels coming. You have no way to
secure your horses, and if you had the strength of Samson
you could not hold them. On come the camels—as the
Afghan acknowledges no right of road he slicks to the
main track. The camel is frightened of nothing, but
horses are as nervous as men. Yon have to cling to your
leaders and curse and pray at the same time with the
heat about 140 in the shade. This state of things is quite
enough to make you feel kindly towards both Afghans
and camels. One poor fellow I knew met a string of
camels on the Wanaaring Road. He stopped his horses,
but the camels came on—he could not get out of their
way, and they would not try to get out of his. At last
the horses, overcome with fear, rushed round, took the
waggon on the lock, capsized it on the top of the two
shaft horses, of which it killed one and crippled the other.
The Afghan jogged on quite unconcernedly and left him
to get out of his trouble as best he could. He was ten
miles from water, the waggon lay on top of two of
the horses, and the rest were so terrified that it
was next to impossible to do anything for them.
Now, suppose that white men started carrying
with camels, what would be the consequence? The
Union would collapse at once [why, in the name of
all that is wonderful, can’t a white man with a camel
be a unionist? —Ed. B.], and carrying would come
down to starvation point, as it did before the Unions
started. Another thing; Let any teamster deliver wool
at Bourke terminus in the same order as the camel-
driver does and I will lay my last penny he doesn’t get a
cent for it in the shape of carriage money. No doubt
carriers are looked upon as the lowest in the social
scale, but as Parson Docker, of Victoria, said, “ Even the
poor bullock-driver has a soul to be saved.” I have
been a reader of The Bulletin for the last eight
or nine years, and have always sworn by it—
and all my friends have looked on it as the one paper that
would never cease to stick to the poor worker. In this
last week’s Bulletin there is an article headed “ Wanted,
a Democratic Daily Paper," and in that you show how it
is that newspapers slowly turn capitalistic as they grow
rich. Surely you yourselves are not getting that beastly
disease ! I, for one, sincerely hops not, as the last
waggon that I made I called The Bulletin, and Jim Hall
says it is the best-named waggon on the road. I would
not like to have to re-christen it—it would never go right
again.—Yours, &c., H. Dutton. Nyngan, 3-12-92. [Aus-
tralia needs camels—she doesn’t need Afghan niggers.
The Afghan nigger must go.—Ed. B.]
At a fashionable Bananaland amateur con-
cert the other evening two ladies came on to sing
a duet. At its conclusion a bouquet was thrown
on the stage fair between the two. Both stooped,
made furtive grabs at the vegetables, glowered at
each other, and finally stalked off, leaving the
posey on the stage. They don’t speak now, and
the thrower of the flowers, who is known to both,
has been sent by both to Coventry.

THE ESTATE OF
FONTAINEBLEAU,
WENTWORTH FALLS.
THIS MAGNIFICENT ESTATE of 239 ACRES has been
surveyed by Messrs. Miller and Lewis, of Pitt Street,
Sydney, into 138 Allotments, ranging from 1 Acre
Residential Blocks to 10J Acres, situate only 500 yards
from the WENTWORTH FALLS RAILWAY STATION,
on the opposite side of the line. It embraces all that fine
and elevated land opposite the mansion of R. M. Pitt,
Esq., whose splendid garden excites the admiration of
every passenger on the Great Western railway.
When the delightful climate of Wentworth Falls is taken
into consideration, the place may be safely described as
The Madeira of the Rlue Mountains.
Delicate constitutions and worn-out business men are
benefited equally by the refreshing purity of the 'mountain
air, and the estate is not surpassed for residential purposes.
The FONTAINEBLEAU ESTATE
is well desci’ibed by the poet, viz.:—
The waratah, all gleaming red,
Lifting in pride its stately head,
Shines through the clustering ferns ;
While as the wattle’s yellow bloom
Falls in soft showers, its deep perfume
The air to sweetness turns.
Would you this haunt of beauty know?
'Tis the charming Estate of Fontainebleau!
The Blaxland Road is now being made from the Railway
fence, and, as it runs right through this magnificent estate,
it will, when finished, be without exception the finest
Carriage Drive on the Mountains.
The FONTAINEBLEAU ESTATE is the most elevated
and beautiful about Wentworth Falls far and away
superior to the land on the other side of the line. The
picturesque views and the extreme fertility of the soil
renders the place very attractive, and specially adapted
for Fruit or Flower Gardens, Orchards or Dairy Farms,
for which Nature seems to have intended it.

once, as they are likely to largely advance in value. The
