The Age of Chivalry
In that burst of glorious hyperbole which
is one of the best passages in the “Reflec-
tions on the Revolution,” Edmund Burke
exclaimed, “The age of chivalry is gone and
that of sopliisters, economists and calculators
has succeeded; and the glory of Europe is
extinguished for ever.” But was there ever
an age of chivalry? Sismondi expressed the
opinion of many' when he said: “The more
closely we look into history, the more clearly
shall we perceive that the system of chivalry
is an invention almost entirely poetical.”
It is true, certainly, that the romantic world
of brave knights and fair ladies, of distressed
damsels and enchanted castles, with the most
picturesque knight-errantry as the only busi-
ness of life, never existed at the Court
of King Arthur or anywhere else. But there
was a chivalry of history as well as a
chivalry of romance.
Chivalry was a body of habits, customs
and manners, and the system of ideals of
the upper classes of feudal society. The
chivalry of Northern France was elaborate
but martial; in the south it was sentimental,
peaceful and profligate; turbulent in the
Empire; in Spain religious; and in England
sober and restrained. But national differ-
ences were unimportant, and all Western
Europe during the Middle Ages regarded the
good knight as the ideal character.
Knighthood as a military institution and
the personal bond of allegiance in feudalism
can both be traced to a Teutonic source.
Their development was different because one
united with religion became chivalry, and
the other became an incident bf a system of
land tenure.
The feudal armies were mainly armies of
cavalry. It was the age of the mail-clad
horseman and of shock tactics in the sim-
plest form. Battles were, as a rule, merely
exhibitions of the prowess of individuals.
The infantry, undisciplined, ill-armed and
inefficient, could never resist the charge of
the knights. The end of military chivalry
came -when infantry learned to withstand
cavalry, and the baseborn was proved equal
in arms to the gentleman. When Froissart
spoke of' the way in which “the English
archers shot wholly together” at Grecy and
Poitiers, he did not know that he was record-
ing the beginning of the end of the chival-
rous warfare of which his Chronicles tell.
The growth of paid standing armies and the
invention of gunpowder completed the defeat
of military chivalry and drove the knights
from the battlefield.
But knighthood and chivalry meant some-
thing more than feudal militarism. This
was due to the Church, which played a large
part in mediaeval life. The act of homage
and the ceremony of conferring knighthood
on a young squire became semi-religious
rituals. Among early warlike peoples investi-
ture with arms meant that a boy had reached
manhood. But later the ceremony meant
that the squire had not merely reached his
majority, but been admitted as a member
of an order, shadowy and vague, and without
office-bearers or roll of members, but a very
real institution nevertheless, which regarded
no distinctions of rank or nationality among
its members.
The Church steadily opposed the constant
petty warfare of the Middle Ages. The tur-
bulent spirit of the barons could not be over-
come at once, but the teachings of the Church
did not go for nothing. The chivalrous
ideals were really a compromise by which a
gospel of peace became the faith of a warrior
class. It was in the Crusades that the con-
nection of militarism and religion became
firmly established. The knight became a
warrior whose arms had been consecrated to
the service of the Lord. After the capture
of Jerusalem in the First Crusade the orders
of Knights Templars and Knights Hospital-
lers were formed. St. Bernard himself drew
up the Rule for the Templars, whose duty
it was to protect pilgrims, to defend the
Holy Sepulchre and to wage war against the
infidel.
War. religion and love were the three ele-
ments in chivalry. It was from the last that
there grew that courtesy and respect for.
women which is often all that chivalry
means to-day. Chivalrous love was a senti-
mental, gallant and rather artificial thing
of phrases, courtesy and compliment. This
was the love of which the troubadours sang.
Love has no place in the Chansons de geste,
the earliest mediawal poems of war, but it
is the main theme of the romances which
succeeded them.
The Provencal idea of courtly love had
nothing to do with marriage. Constancy
was the only virtue in love. Marriage con-
cerned lawyers, not lovers. There is more
than a trace of licentiousness in many of
the precise and complex verses of the trouba-
dours. But despite this, and despite their
extravagances, troubadour songs had an un-
doubted effect in determining that a new
courtesy and respect for women should be
an essential part of the age of chivalry. It
is hard now to realise what a change in out-
look this meant. H. W. Davis, in his book.
“The Middle Ages,” says of chivalry: “It
rediscovered one-half of human nature. But
for chivalry the Beatrice of Dante, the Laura
of Petrarch, Shakspeare’s Miranda and
Goethe’s Marguerite could not have been
created, much less comprehended.”
The times of the French wars of Edward
111., Scott and Hallam say, was the greatest
age of chivalry. They were full of gallant
exploits, adventures and picturesque cour-
tesy. Chivalry then appears at its best and
worst. The fairest parts of France were de-
vastated by useless raids which, though they
gave individual knights opportunities to do
great feats, had not the remotest value in
the campaign. But, in spite of the brutality
towards the civilian population, there was a
surprising degree of mercy and clemency
shown between the knights, both French
and English. Prisoners were well treated
and often released on parole. Chivalry intro-
duced a new principle, that there were laws
of war. They were only applied to knights
certainly, but it was. an advance none the
less, and an advance which has never been
lost. From the elaborate courtesies of
heralds and the punctilious ceremonies of
pursuivants has come a large part of modern
international law and custom.
Chivalry was an attempt to fuse two moral
systems. Under, its discipline a warlike
society was taught to respect a religion of
peace, and soldiers were told that they might
serve Christ, not by turning the other cheek,
but by slaying Mohammedans. Because it
was based on antagonistic ethical systems,
it could never be a perfect ideal. It has
been bitterly attacked because it tended to
foster an arrogant class-consciousness and
to teach a love of war. Freeman said that
it substituted its own capricious ideas for
the higher standard of the man, the citizen
and the Christian, that it fostered a sense
of honor and not a sense of duty, and placed
allegiance to an overlord before allegiance to
God. But if chivalry did anything it taught
a high sense of duty. A good knight must
serve his God. be loyal to his overlord and
devoted to his mistress. In one sense
it levelled as much as it: raised class-
distinctions. Feudalism depended on a series
of grades one above the other, which tended
more and more to become strict , caste divi-
sions. Knighthood broke down this and
gave a measure of social equality to the
whole feudal nobility.
The Age of Chivalry gradually passed away.
Chivalry became overloaded with artificial
pageantry and with the unreal theories of
heraldry. It was ended in history by gun-
powder and the Renaissance, and laughed
out of literature by Cervantes with Don
Quixote. But it has left a large inheritance.
It supplemented the teachings of the
Church. To women it gave an honorable
place in society. It taught men the manly
virtues of loyalty, courage and generosity, of
keeping troth and speaking truth.

The Cow-tracks of Literature
That I had never been able to read a
Henry James, a Jane Austin or a George
Eliot novel from cover to cover had at times
worried me. An unguarded confession of
such Weakness in the company of literary
enthusiasts had often left me with a sense
of mental inferiority. So, on vacation, I
took with me only a selection of the reputed
best books of the “masters” of the Victorian
literary age, and for a fortnight read no-
thing else. And I came back rejoicing: I
am not inferior, and consumption of thp out-
put of moderns has not made me a literary
moron. By the time I had ploughed through
a dozen volumes, I found myself thinking of
an experience in the old section of Boston
City, in which I once was hopelessly lost. A
citizen afterwards explained that the streets
of old Boston followed the cow-tracks of the
days when there was no city. But not far
away was New Boston, spacious, methodically
cut into squares, with every house easy of
identification.
The books I had been reading were the
cow-tracks of fiction. They are of immense
interest as reflections of the customs and
thoughts of the period in which they were
written, but they are not outstanding literary
monuments, unless prolixity, tedious elabora-
tion and limited vision are the insignia of
literary art. Separating narrative from de-
scriptive writing, and from the author’s
reflections generally expressed in slabs of
involved prose or in pompous dialogue, the
stories told mainly concern the doings of
social groups of the “cultured” upper classes
of their period. Society was then sharply
divided into “We” and “They.” Books were
written for “We,” “They” either could not
read at all or were content with such rudi-
mentary literature as “We” thought it wise
for them to read. The novelist wrote then,
as he writes now, with odd exceptions, for
those who read books, and as the only sub-
stantial class of readers of the early middle-
Victorian era were the aristocracy’ and the
higher-middle class, novels were only written
for their delectation. As an illustration, the
“Tragic Muse” of Henry James. Here we
have 800 pages devoted to a few years of
the history of a group of upper-middle class
people, divided between its desire to keep up
a family political tradition and to cultivate
a leaning towards aesthetics. True it is that
an actress and her mother are brought into
the story, but only to emphasise the in-
feriority of those who, urged by ambition,
really worked.
James is proclaimed by the literary critic
as a stylist, and tears are sometimes shed
over the failure of modern writers to imitate
him and other old masters of fiction. But
what does this much-vaunted style amount
to? His novels are gemmed with passages
of fine prose, but equally fine passages adorn
the works of a dozen writers of fiction of
this century. His characterisations are bui It
up with meticulous care, but lack the vitality
of more modern creations. The descriptive
connecting links, largely dispensed with in
the modern novel, are often laboriously
written and always tedious. The writer of
the Victorian era, when the output of fiction
was one-fiftieth of what it is to-day, regarded
250,000 words as the correct quota for -a
novel. To-day he who goes much over
100,000 words is eyed with suspicion by
publishers. Occasionally a writer like
Arnold Bennett in his “Old Wives’ Tale” is
allowed to saunter along, but with few
exceptions the writer of to-day tells his story,
draws his pictures and says what he has
to say in as many words as are necessary
and no more. And this is not merely a
concession to the growing demand for cap-
sule food. It is better art. The novel of
to-day is more than a chronicle of the doings
of a dominant class. It is a vehicle for the
expression of thought. Buried in every heap
of rubbish turned out by printing presses
can be found at least one book which has
much more vitality and often more terse art
than most of the “classics” of the last cen-
tury. Galsworthy’s “Indian Summer of For-
syte,” and Hergesheimer’s “Linda Condon”
are truer works of art than anything ever
written by James or Borrow; May Sin-
clair’s “Tree of Heaven” than Jane Austin’s
“Pride and Prejudice.”
Our literary savants are badly infected
with that conservatism which venerates all

ancient things and affords gracious patron-

“Hounds of Hell” is a greater work of art
than Tennyson’s “In Memoriam” is to them
rank heresy, for without traces of moss
or mildew no literature can be permanently
classified as true art. Without shame I de-
clare my preference for twentieth-century
literary art, and vow only to use the works
of the stylist as bed books.
G.S.B.
“One D-Thing After Another
Mother England is a prolific begetter of
literary enigmas. John Masefield is one.
Unlike J. 0. Snaitli. his fellow enigma, who
alternates masterpieces . with potboilers,
Masefield has never reached the high-water
mark of achievement, but’ has often given
every appearance of getting there on the
very next tide. Many years ago—so many
that the circumstance seems to be a part
of early Saxon literature —he wrote a novel
that was not a novel called “Captain Mar-
garet.” In it he took his favorite personally-
conducted tourist trip before the mast to
South America, or, rather, to the Spanish
Main. He carried in his baggage nothing so
cumbersome as a plot, but on the way lie met
some interesting people, a number of gor-
geous sunsets, haunting seascapes, dramatic
incidents and other concomitants of a bud-
ding Conrad. A great capacity for word-
painting and a power of evoking rather
vague emotions and the dim shadows of
lovely women raised great expectations. His
next exploit was “The Everlasting Mercy,
published in the English Review —not the
present organ of propaganda of the English
Tory party, but the virile, nervously experi-
menting monthly which Austin Harrison
steered into new worlds of literature. “The
Everlasting Mercy” appeared in 1911. Six
months later “The Widow in the Bye.
Street” followed. At the end of the year
the same journal printed “Dauber,” and a
few months afterwards “The Daffodil Fields.”
One can read these long narrative poems
nowadays without an excessive quickening of
the pulses, but on their first appearance they
made a sensation. The contemporary con-
dition of English poetry should be considered.
The Poet Laureate was resting on his repu-
tation after the exhausting effort of produc-
ing his famous verses on the Jameson Raid,
Rudvard Kipling’s latest emanation was still
considered worth cabling, at half a crown a
w r ord, around the world, and Britain’s minor
poets were busying themselves with improve-
ments on Swinburne’s rhythms, and with
pale imitations of the Lake school. These
poems of Masefield were attempts to make
articulate the strivings for expression _ot
the lowly. They chimed in with the rising
tendency to question the divine origin of
English society which, besides enclosing the
common lands, had lately turned literature
into a preserve for elegant grouse-shooting.
Appraising the poems to-day we find their
democratic insoiration of little moment—m
fact, a little out of date. Since Joyce dis-
closed the parlous condition of his sub-
conscious mind in “Ulysses,” we have ceased
to be distressed at mere frankness of speech.
But amongst a great deal of doggerel Mase-
field scattered some passages of rare lyric
beauty. In “Dauber” especially the sea was
pictured from the fo’c’s’le head as never be-
fore in English literature. Seafaring men
and all ivho feel the fascination of the sea
between accesses of mol dc mcr will for a
long time find that passage round the Horn
a pure delight. After this sudden activity,
beyond a few poems exhibiting a unique
command of rhythmical devices and otliers
of dramatic quality, Masefield did little that
attracted. His reappearance was made in
his old domain of- the novel.
The movie rights of “Sard Harker” are
stated to have been sold for £12,000. It is
almost unnecessary to say more. The story
takes the reader to one of those incalculable
South American States where the law allows
men to kill burglars and throw the body
out: after three days it is taken away by the
police and burned, with no questions asked.
Almost anything may happen in a land like
that, and in “Sard Harker” anything does
happen—also everything. The English first
mate of a ship goes ashore in the capital
of this pleasant land and overhears a plot
to kidnap a beautiful girl. He sets out to warn
the lady, who lives a few miles beyond the
town; he loses his way and, after journeying
vast distances, and meeting a succession ot
people, every one of whom draws a knife at
him, shoots him at sight or bites him, and
passing through a succession of adventures
which have no connection whatever with the
main story, returns in the last chapter to
where he ‘started and accidentally helps to
save the girl. The thing is a penny dreadful.
But even a penny dreadful should have shape.
“Hamlet” is an example of a shapely penny
dreadful. Masefield’s book has no shape,
although it is written by a master of
English.
But, bad as it is, it is surpassed m
futility by its successor, Odtua (Ileinemann).
This novel is a brazen rewriting of the
previous story, with an eye. turned even more
compellingly on the movies. An English
youth lands at the same seaport town and
also sets out to convey a warning concerning
the danger in which a lovely female indigene
has fallen. Once more he gets lost and
again he passes through a series of adven-
tures as tedious as amazing. The crooks,
thugs, murderers, cannibal Indians and
. other fortuitous obstacles shoot, stab and
bite him as before, and likewise have no
connection with the theme. In the final
pages he returns to his starting point with-
out having conveyed his warning and is
seized by soldiers and, for his own protection,
put on a steamer about to sail for New York.
In short-story length this idea of an un-
romantic foreigner’s plunge to no purpose
into the politics of a turbulent South Amer-
ican republic might be artistic and amusing;
326 pages of it are an imposition. And an
appendix, in which the artistic ending is
explained away, makes the • offence more
rank.
The title “Odtaa” is not. explained by any-
thing in the text. Presumably it means
“One D— Thing After Another.” If so,
it is. most regrettably, a fairly apt descrip-
tion of the writer’s own career.
M.G.S.
A Gentle Knight
Robert Louis Stevenson has described how
in his youth he “played the Sedulous ape
to Hazlitt, Lamb, Wordsworth, Hawthorne
Montaigne and a host ot others. I hat, like
it or not, is,” he said, “the way to learn to
write. .. .and that is why a revival of letters
is alwavs accompanied or heralded by ? a cast
back to earlier and fresher models. JNo
better proof of the truth of this could be
offered than the earlier work ot Maurice
Hewlett. He admits it freely m the interest-
ing body of correspondence recently pub-
lished, The Letters of Maurice Hewlett
(Methuen ,i. “The first book l remember
reading was an edition of the ivlorte a
Arthur.’ There is no doubt but that hail a
great influence upon my writing when 1 be-
gan to write in earnest.... My own opinion
of mv literary sponsoring would be Malory,
the Bible. Don Quixote (in English), bir
Thomas Browne and Carlyle.” He describes
how from his childhood he wrote in tits anil
starts and imitated every style that attracted
him. “I remember,” he says, “once answer-
ing an invitation to a croquet-party m the
style of a letter in Sallust or Livy—and
very much astonished the good lady must
have been who received it.’
When at the close of last and in the early
vears of the present century “The Forest
Lovers.” “Richard Yea-and-Nay” and "1 lie
Fool Errant” were found on every bookstall
and the world rejoiced in the revival oi old
romance with its dark forests, its chivalrous
knights and forlorn damsels, their author
was tossing a troubled head upon his pillow.
It was delightful work, full of fancy and
color, but wholly artificial, moving on the
brilliant surface of things, but never touch-
ing their core. That was the tragedy ot
Hewlett’s life. He was still in the thirties
and a successful novelist with royalties
pouring in. The vein of literary ore could
not be worked indefinitely, but if lie had been
less of an idealist than he was and more ot
the practical man of business ready to supply
what the public was eager to purchase, he
possibly would not have ended his days in
comparative poverty. Of "The Fool Errant,
which deservedly had found a place among
the best-sellers of the year 1905, he wrote:
“It has brought me much money, but no
credit from myself.” And, later on: "No
doubt I have done well: no doubt 1 have
also increased my style of living; no doubt
that has meant I must write novels: and
that involves that I do them not so well, for
what I do of necessity I do as an exercise.
So the earnest soul of Maurice Hewlett
sought to grapple with the real—to create
that which would hold the soul of things.
He ceased fo take novel writing of the roman-
tic school seriously and set out, a Don
Quixote of the pen, seeking wrongs to right,
looking hither and thither more or less aim-
lessly for a means of full expression, l o get
the best out of oneself, the whole content of
one’s being, without regard to reward, was
the ideal. In his youth he had practised
poetry in the imitative way that he had
practised prose, but in the first flush of suc-
cess as a novelist had put it aside. He was
a strange mixture of self-confidence and
underlying fear. He set himself a task
with absolute assurance of its issue. It
would be done to the last ounce of his capa-
city. Repeatedly he wrote and re-wrote his
work, no effort lacking to make it perfect;
yet all the time fear possessed him that the
breath of life was not in it. “The Queen s
Quair” was written four times, and yet he
was dissatisfied; and he turned from fiction
to poetry seeking utterance. It was, he
believed, his one way to immortality : and it
failed him. “I can hardly remember the
time,” he says, “when I did not write verse.
It was by an accident, and an unfortunate
one for ine, that I was tempted to write
prose. If I had not succumbed to it 1
would have been a more considerable poet
than I am now ever likely to be All my
real romances would, I believe, be better it
they were versified ; and more than once 1
have thought of doing it lam not a novel-
ist who is an observer, but always begin with
an idea or a person, and weave the tale round
about that.”
Then came the war, and it changed Hew-
lett's outlook on life. He entered on its
activities at home whilst his son was in
France. The Board of Agriculture sent
him north to investigate and report upon
the conditions of agricultural labor. Hours
of work, wages, food, housing—the things
of life among the poor and earth-bound
thrust out the fancies of the mind, the
pictures of sun-bathed mediaeval Italy with
its knights and fair dames and its beggars
whose very tatters were colored with the
glamor of' romance. The result was two-
fold, for it brought out probably the best
Hewlett could offer from his fount of poetry*
in “The Village Wife’s Lament” and thrust
him into politics. With a sort of knightly
chivalry he espoused the cause of Labor,
though not with any high hopes. Idealism
was scotched in him. “I never thought,
he wrote, “that I should go to the grave a
pessimist, but five years’ war with all the
resources of civilisation have done it.” His
final pronouncement on Labor was that it
“could onlv succeed by being honorable and
reasonable*. . . . The rich aren’t going to re-
main rich much longer. Or if they do, their
riches won’t buy for them what they want.
Sooner or later all people will find out that
to ‘behave’ is the only way to be comfort-
able.” .
The war had not only eaten up lus avail-
able means but drawn him away from his
vocation. When he returned to it the de-
mand for such work as he could produce was
very limited. With age went the facile use
of liis pen, the imagination was no longer
vivid, no longer treasure-filled. He was
out of the race, forgotten, and in one of the
last of this collection of very human letters
occurs a passage that has a deep pathos:
“I am trying to write a film scenario now.
And I am hi owed if I know whether I can
do it or not!”
T.B.C.
Worship of the Phrase
After a dozen years in southern Australia
teaching and being taught to eschew the set
phrase, the obvious construction in writing
and tlie journalese cliche, it is astonishing
to find oneself in Queensland, where all the
forbidden things are usual, if not demanded
by the native stylist.
For my enlightenment—or my sins—search
of a livelihood causes me each day to distil
for their essential brightnesses about 40 dis-
trict and State daily and periodical news-
papers. It is this exercise which discovers
for me the strange characteristic of Queens-
land writers. It is not, as might be ex-
pected, confined to the smaller, obscurer pub-
lication into which style as known to the
“great daily” has not penetrated. The met-
ropolitan papers are as faithful to the pre-
vailing custom.
For instance, no one above the status of
a drunk or a deadbeat dies. All “pass away,”
leaving various people to “mourn their loss.”
and they go to their rest as “remains” “fol-
lowed by a cortege.” No one is ever given
anything. He is “made the recipient of”
something which never fails to be “hand-
some'" and “suitably inscribed,” and for
which he invariably “suitably responds.”
Accidents are always “unfortunate.” and
accounts of them never fail to begin with
a statement that it was an accident that
occurred, the subsequent details of mangling,
battle or mishap not being considered suffi-
cient to proclaim the fact. It is always men-
tioned, also, that had the accident not re-
mained at the accidental stage it might very
well have been fatal.
No one walks —he or she “proceeds.” No
one. from a politician backing and filling to
a raconteur telling a yarn, ever says any-
thing—he always “states" it. The übiqui-
tous useful ambulance always “conveys.” like
the wise: it does not carry, which appears
to be an undignified and commonplace thing
never done by ambulances.
It is apparently bluntly indelicate to an-
nounce that a person is ill unless the fact
is prefaced with the note that his or her
“many friends will regret to hear” it. In
the same pursuit of delicacy and caution no
citizen is mentioned who*is not “respected”
and “esteemed,” especially if ill and likely
soon to suffer “demise.” All gifts are
“donated.” and all “recipients” receive them
“as a token of esteem,” usually as “a token
of the esteem in which lie is held by his
many friends.”
The weather if good is “all that could be
desired.” and if bad is “inclement” ; all brides
"look charming”; all applause is “raptu-
rous” ; all organists “preside” over their kists
of whustles ; and all afternoon teas are “par-
taken of.” AH public speakers “receive an
ovation,” and all motions are “carried by
acclamation.” All fires “might have been
serious” had they not stopped before the
serious stage was reached. Mention of a
city or district must be prefaced by “our
fair” city or district, and most mayors are
“our worthy” citizen of that rank. All social
evenings are “pleasant” or. preferably, “very
pleasant”; all wedding presents are “numer-
ous and handsome.”
O. Henry’s skit on the use of journalesy
cliches as a Russo-Jap war-cypher has long
lost its punch when applied to the modern
newspaper—stylebooks and “rough subs.”
have seen to that. Not, however, in Queens-
land. A complete textbook might easily be
prepared, and it would “click” throughout
the State with a 100 p.c. click. I had not
believed it possible—until I came to see.
OBFUSOUS.
A Satchel of Books
Selected Prose of John Milton (Oxford Press).
One of “The World’s Classics” series. An excellent
introduction is furnished by Professor Wallace of
Toronto.
Black Valley, by Raymond Weaver (Geoffrey Bles).
Here East meets West and the encounter shocks
Mrs. Grundy. The West in this case is an American
missionary body under the leadership of one of those
militants who propagate their gospel with the
violence of tongues. A rough bit of carpentry, with
the glimmer of design at its back.
The Sleeping Queen, by Neville Brand (John Lane).
This author made a good impression with his first
novel, “Narrow Seas,” and has since deepened it.
The present story shows the same careful and con-
scientious workmanship. It depends on character-
drawing and atmosphere rather than on any intensity
or complexity of plot.
Ernestine Sophie, by Sophia Cleugh (Thornton
Butterworth). From an English rectory a child of
14 is translated to one of those “Rupert of Hentzau”
kingdoms so convenient to novelists, and. with a wisdom
passing that of serpents and altogether marvellous
in one of her years, defeats the plots of the aged
King's enemies, eventually marries the man of her
choice and seats herself on the throne amid the
acclamations of the village—or rather kingdom.
Sprightly and wonderful.
Granite, a tragedy, by Olemence Dane (Heinemann).
Miss Dane’s latest is gloomy drama wrought out
on the granite island of Lundy, where English law
did not run, a hundred years ago. Judith Morris is
the wife, of the principal landowner on this isolated
spot, a man silent and morose and with but one
thought, the accumulation of money; and in the
quest of it he does not scruple to sacrifice life. Lov-
ing bright things, the loneliness and unrelieved
monotony of her existence force Judith into rebellion
against the granite-souled man to whom she- is
linked. Temptation assails , her and tragedy follows.
Into the plot is woven a sinister spirit of evil
that intensifies a play untouched by a single gleam
of happiness. As powerful as “A Bill of Divorce-
ment” but hopelessly depressing.
Bluestocking Letters, selected bv R. Brimley John-
son (John Lane). In the early part of the fifteenth
century a club of men and women was formed at
Venice, then a centre of intellectual interests, and blue
stockings were hit upon as a badge of membership. After
a long vogue the club lapsed, to be revived at the
close of the following century in Paris, where for
a period the Has Bleu movement held sway among
the feminists of the time. Thenceforward sporadic
Bluestocking societies sprang up in England. In
the latter part of the eighteenth century Bas Bleu
was once more given life by the energetic Mrs.
Montagu, who, with Mrs. Thrale —probably stimu-
lated to the effort over a dish of tea with Dr. John-
son —-formed a salon to enjoy society in “Blue-
stockings,” which had come to mean the equivalent
of an absence of the forms and ceremonies of
fashion. Apparently this society was at first con-
fined to women, for Hannah More, its only official
historian, refers to “a very pleasant comical dinner
of only nine females,” whereat it was agreed “that
men were by no means so necessary as we had all
been foolish enough to fancy.” But later on young
men of fashion found their way into “the first
public female club ever known”—so if not so
necessary they were apparently convenient. It is
with this phase of bluestocking development that
the letters deal, and they give the reader a ■ very
entertaining and intimate view of the characters
and thought of this group of pioneers in the expan-
sion of women’s, sphere of interests.

Roads
Investigation of the Economic Value of Reinforcement in Concrete
Roads by the Highway Research Board, Division of Engineering and
Industrial Research, National Research Council, Washington, D.C.
(The investigation covered conditions on about 3000 miles of
concrete roads, both plain and reinforced, located in 26 States.)
Summary of Conclusions
1.
The amount of cracking and subsequent disintegrating is a
function of time; thus, the rate of cracking is a measure of
the life of the pavement. , , ' , „
3. The data show that steel reinforcement reduced the rate ot
cracking and thus increased the life of the pavement, inis
applies both to concrete pavements and other pavements laid
upon a concrete base. , ~
3. Crack reduction is more economically accomplished by the use
of steel reinforcement than by additional thickness of concrete.
4. A greater reduction was afforded by small steel members closely
spaced than by larger members wider spaced.
5. Increasing weight of mesh from 35 to 56 lb. per 100 sq. ft.
considerably reduced cracking. _ , , ,
6. Mesh reinforcement, 25 to 56 lb. per 100 sq. ft., reduced cracks
35 to 70 p.c. in pavements of like thickness.
Mesh reinforcement, 25 to 56 lb. per 100 sq. ft. and bar mat
reinforcement 651 b. per 100 sq. ft.—2s p.c. longitudinal -
reduced cracks more than one additional inch of concrete, but
one additional inch of concrete reduced cracks more than bars
(43 to 48 lb. per 100 sq. ft.) placed transversely only.
With good crushed stone aggregate, 56 lb. per 100 sq. ft. mesh
reinforcement, or 1701 b. per 100 sq. ft. bar reinforcement, 50 p.c.
7.
each way, caused a reduction in combined transverse and
longitudinal cracks equal to that indicated for 2 inches addi-
tional centre tliickness.
9. Mesh reinforcement of 381 b. per 100 sq. ft. has been effective
for a thin layer of concrete laid as resurfacing upon an old
concrete roftd*
10. One additional inch of edge thickness reduced corner cracks
more than mesh reinforcement 25 to 68 lb. per 100 sq. ft. or
% to % inch bar reinforcement, hut progressive destruction
following the appearance of corner cracks was arrested by
steel reinforcement.
11. All types of sfeel reinforcement across cracks tended to hold
together fractured slabs.
12. Bar reinforcement across transverse joints, without proper pro-
vision for slippage and clearance, resulted in breakage and
subsequent expensive repairs.
13. For long slabs, 75 to 100 feet or over, edge bar reinforcement
with continuous bond caused corner cracks if the area of steel
exceeded M sq. inch.
14. A remarkable agreement was found to exist between results
of observations on roads in service and results furnished by
a w r ide range of experimental roads and laboratory tests.
An outline of the procedure of the investigation, together with statements of indications and
conclusions of the findings, supplemented by supporting data arranged in tables, charts, sketches,
and photographs, were presented at a conference at the National Research Council on November
4th and sth, 1925. The conference was attended by the following:—

The Holidayers.
Drowsy is the heat,
Dusty is the way,
But what is dust and what is heat
When youth is gay and life is sweet,
And all the flowers and all the trees,
Made musical by birds and bees
That come and go what way they please,
Are keeping holiday?
Rovers, know ye not
Bread ye should be earning,
Lustrous hours of day
Into lucre turning?
Pleasant is your lot
Happy, happy folk.
Heeding not to-morrow
Or to-morrow’s yoke—
Want and, maybe, sorrow!
Rovers, yours is health.
Keep it, keep it ever
If ye can and may.
Never yet, oh never,
Coffers held such wealth!
Never yet, in truth,
Was there golden measure
Like the gold of youth
And of joy ye treasure,,

Castle Peak.
Long ago in the lazy weather,
Back in the gullies of box and fern,
Quartz and gravel and honeyed heather.
“ Where the red roads twist and the steep
tracks turn,
Those were the hours had joys for lending
By leafy vista and laughing creek,
Under the glamor of blue skies bending
O’er crag and gully by Castle Peak.
The eagle swept from her own high eyrie
Sailing into the western gold.
On brown wide pinions that could not weary
Over the ranges, fold on fold ;
The lizard slid from his sunny basking,
The dron-fly flashed in a jewelled streak,
And the joy of the uplands was mine for
asking
In shine and shadow by Castle Peak.
The hush birds called from the leaning
laurels
And ti-tree twisting by bend and reach,
Where the green fronds dip and the swift
creek quarrels
With stone-strewn rapid and shelving
beach ;
When twilight steals with her'sombre graces
Through amethyst aisles that the white
stars seek,
1 wish I was back in those lonely places
Under the shadow of Castle Peak.
Far from the paddocks of creamy clover,
Lost in the lanes of the saplings tall,
The peace of the high hills brooding over
And the glory of autumn above it all;
The south wind’s fingers in green boughs
harping,
The filigreed sunbeams hide and seek,
A wide world distant from cares and carping
High in the havens of Castle Peak!
If the old grey Fates grew kind, and, smiling,
Bade one choose from the past a prize,
I might dream of the lovelight lost, beguiling,
In the moonlit magic of once dear eyes.
But I’ll grieve no more for those Dead-sea
apples,
Bitter for tasting and ill to seek;
For the gleam and the glory unchanging
dapples
The cool green stairways of Castle Peak.
So I’d just be wanting the April weather
And the gift of a care-free heart again,
By rift and runnel and tangled heather,
In the slanting gold of the sunbeam rain,
And the pipes of Pan that were joy begotten
In sighing she-oak and crooning creek,
Lilting the runes of a year forgotten,
Back in the gullies of Castle Peak.

Vain Knowledge.
We have to learn of life, and, learning, know
How all our learning is of no avail
To staunch a tear or ease the bitter pain
Of love’s deluding—how it blindly piles
Stone upon stone in the day’s building : then,
The dull day’s labor done, on slumber falls,
And like a peasant on his creaky bed
Shuts up the senses and shuts out the sun—
As ignorance itself might, lull a whim
With a fool’s ditty or a drunkard shake
The dust of the world from him until he
Regains remembrance of the last coin spent
In the delusive pleasure he lias known.

A Dream to Dream.
Some liave a goal that is set in a star,
Some have a song to sing,
Some have a love that is lost afar,
Some have a flight to wing;
One has a glimpse of a gleaming crown,
One has a tuneful theme,
One has a quest where the sun goes down—
/ have a dream to dream!
One must sigh that the world is false,
One has a lodestar true ;
One is weary with heart that halts,
Glad when the doom is due;
Another yearns for a lordly throne
Set in a golden gleam;
Soon he sighs for his prospects prone—
I have a dream to dream.
Weep who will for the light-o’-love,
Cry who will for the moon ;
Fight who will for a fair one’s glove,
March who will for a rune;
Push who will the hustling throng,
Glide who will the stream,
Break who will on the bars of wrong—
f have a dream to dream.

PAGE HAS ANOTHER IDEA.
Tiie breakdown of the Melbourne financial
conference resulted in the Bruce-Page Gov-
ernment deciding to proceed without any
more parleying with State Frights Premiers.
So it is repealing the Fisher Government’s
Surplus Revenue Act, by virtue of which
the States have received 255. per head, plus
a special allowance to Westralia, for 16
years, although the Commonwealth need not
have given them a penny. The per capita,
payments are to cease on June 30, when
the financial year closes. As a set-off, the
States are to be allowed to take over and
adjust to their corresponding imposts the
Federal estate duties and taxes on land
values and entertainments, from which the
Commonwealth derived just on £4,000,000
in 1923-24 (the latest 12 months covered
by Wickens’s “Year Book”), or about
£3,000,000 less than the per capita payments.
They are also to be privileged to increase
their income-taxes, which yielded nearly
£10,500,000 in 1923-24, for the National Gov-
ernment, while retaining its own tax, which
produced £11,000,000 in 1923-24, promises
a4O p.c. reduction on 1925-26 rates. There
are likewise to be “adjusting grants” to
States- which may be embarrassed by these
arrangements, although the Commonwealth
itself will lose by them, as is obvious. The
new plan is better than the one turned down
by the State Frights Premiers, with so much
insistence on imaginary “rights,” but not
much better. It offers the public no pros-
pect of relief from burdensome taxes or
criminal waste in the collection thereof.
It includes no provision for taking over
State debts. Instead of imposing checks on
the reckless extravagance of the provincial
Governments, it invites them to hold out
their hands when they are hard up. In fact,
considering that the Commonwealth Trea-
surer has it in his power to force economies
on the States, to take over a large propor-
tion of their debts and add a sinking fund
thereto, and to effect a complete separation
oi: Federal and State fields of taxation, there-
by freeing Australian industry from oppres-
sive imposts, he is making a poor use of a
great opportunity.
In an unlucky moment the Treasurer said
that his Government aimed at withdrawing
from the domain of direct taxation. The
State Frights pack pounced on the remark
and demanded that the Federal income-tax
should be dropped straightway. Some un-
wary Protectionists joined in the cry, and
there have been times when the worthy
Page, who is too kind-hearted to be a first-
class financier, seemed on the point of yield-
ing to it. Had he done so he would have
soon found himself in serious straits, and
those Sydney manufacturers who swelled the
State Frights chorus would have wished
they had never been born. The Common-
wealth has to find £29,000,000 p.a. for war
services (the States, of course, have no war
debt), interest accounting for £18,000,000
and pensions for £7,500,000. In addition, there
is approximately £8,000,000 for old-age and
invalid pensions and maternity allowances,
while Defence expenditure, which got down
to £4,500,000 in 1924-25, is soaring owing to
the cost of the two new cruisers and other
necessary additions to the establishment, and
the Northern Territory, the Kalgoorlie-Port
Augusta railway and New Guinea have to
be kept going out of consolidated revenue,
which also had to find £242,000 for losses
in the Postmaster-General’s Department last
year. The State Frights contention is that
all these obligations and others which the
Bruce-Page Government has light-heartedly
undertaken, such as road expenditure in the
States, should be met out of customs and
excise revenue. The thing would be im-
possible even if the Treasurer could depend
upon the customs and excise revenue re-
maining at £37,000,000, liis estimate for the
present year, and, of course, he cannot.
Excise yields about £10,000,000 p.a.; the
amount has varied little since 1920-21, when
the Greene tariff arrived, and is not likely
to increase to any extent. Customs receipt’s
have shot up from £13,705.000 in 1919-20
to £27,081,000 last year. Referring to the
jump in 1922-23 and 1923-24 the invaluable
Wickens says it was “due to a considerable
extent to heavy borrowings abroad by the
Commonwealth and State Governments.”
These heavy borrowings are still going on,
but they must inevitably decline, which means
that the customs receipts will be deflated to
correspond. If the Pratten duties prove
effect've there will necessarily be , a further
shrinkage. And it is quite on the cards that
the Government will have to make the
metals-and-machinery and apparel-and-textile
sections of the tariff practically prohibitive
to save industries imperilled by overseas
competition, strikes, punitive State taxation,
the 44-hour-week and freak measures like
Lang’s Workmen’s Compensation Act, in
which event these particular imports will
disappear from the, revenue, list, to which
they have been contributing £9,000,000 to
£10,000,000 p.a., as sugar has disappeared. If
Bruce and Page were foolish enough to sur-
render their income-tax they would be driven
to sacrificing the national fiscal policy, and
with it the great bulk of the manufacturing
industries, to the necessity of getting in
more revenue. That, of course, is what the
State Frighters, who are mostly Foreign-
traders. are after, but it is singular that they
should have Protectionist journals and mem-
bers of the Chamber of Manufacturers for
allies.
* * * *
The Bruce-Page Government is warranted
in yielding up its death duties and taxes
on land values and entertainments, but only
if the States hand over their income-taxes
in return. It is alleged that the States
couldn’t get along without taxing incomes,
but Westralia got along without it till 1907,
Queensland and Tasmania till 1902 and N. S.
Wales and Victoria till 1895. The S. Aus.
impost dates back to 1884 — i.e., 16 years
before Federation—but Central State Ad-
ministrations, Labor included, have been
consistently moderate in their demands,
whereas Labor Governments in Queensland
and N. S. Wales have employed the income-
tax as a means of smiting wage-payers, think-
ing in their illogical fashion that they were
thereby helping wage-earners. In the last
pre-war year the six State income-taxes
yielded £2,869,000. Without being respon-
sible for a penn’orth of war expenditure the
State Governments increased the rates until
the yield in 1920-21 was £10,180,000. Taxa-
tion of incomes lias certainly been overdone
in Australia, which has to compete with a
country (Argentina) where income-taxes are
unknown; but it is the States that have
overdone it.. And they will overdo it still
more—especially those whose Governments
have struck at the wage-payer with the 44-
liour week and similar two-edged weapons—
unless the thing is taken from them and kept
by the Commonwealth (with some assist-
ance from tlie 'Customs and excise) for pay-
ment of the ’war debt, diminishing as that
diminishes. Not till they are deprived of
their income-taxes will the States live cleanly.
In fact, the taxpayers will get no benefit
from these latest Bruce-Page proposals un-
less they arc so altered as to provide for
the complete separation of Commonwealth
and State fields of taxation (the surrender
of the State income-taxes being a sine qua
von) and the taking over of as many of the
State debts as the Commonwealth can handle.
THE SUCCESS OF IMMIGRATION.
A small crowd of indistinct visionaries
preached the community almost to death a
year or two ago with the story of how the
one hope of Australia Jay in putting a Mil-
lion Farmers on a Million Farms. It went
into retirement for a while; then, the other
day, it began another movement for the salva-
tion of our native land, the scene being laid
at the National Club. Sydney, with the in-
variable and indomitable Joseph Cau-
kutiieks as the star orator of the occasion.
The case laid before the public was much
the same old case, and might be summarised
thus:—
The vaunted immigration schemes of recent years
have “failed utterly.”
“Australia has unlimited and untapped resources,
and 90 per cent, of its soil is still Crown land.”
“The Federal Government should make a trust
fund of the land-tax collections, which are about
£3,000,000 per year, and the money should be
used for the acquisition and subdivision of large
estates suitable for settlement and close to rail-
ways. Each year about £4,000,000 worth of
land could be resumed or purchased at an average
of about £5 per acre, and some 2000 farms pro-
vided each year for settlement.”
Australia should grab with both hands (in fact,
should have grabbed long ago) at the British
Government’s offer to lend £34,000,000 at 2 per
cent, interest for the first 10 years and fu'll interest
for the rest of time and all eternity.
A quantity of Britain’s 2,000,000 unemployed, practi-
cally all town workers, and many of them demoralised
and turned into slackers by the “dole,” should be
brought here, and set up in the cultivation business.
As a sort of postscript, the South-to-North railway
and other lines should be built, to make the empty
lands available.
And as an utterly unaccountable postscript, the
State Governments should be abolished, and the
whole load of detail carried by one Government,
or perhaps by one man after the one Government
is abolished.
* * * •
There is something ludicrous in the assur-
ance that 90 per cent, of the Common-
wealth (really over 9jl per cent.) is still
public land when it is followed by the
urgent demand that the Federal Govern-
ment should provide for the much-talkedmf
settlement by commencing to repurchase,
from rich and obliging gentlemen who seem
willing to sell at a favorable price, the little 9
per cent, which has ceased to be public. But,
worse still, this repurchased land is to be close
to railways, so that it will be merely re-
settlement of old regions, and not settlement
at all. A considerable lot of fairly populated
aD ij well 'trodden country has already been
sold back to "the Crown” with disastrous
consequences, in return for £75,000,000 of
loan money, and many obliging and affluent
gentlemen have profited in the process. The
proposal to continue the process by sup-
plementing the loans with Federal land-tax
revenue looks like undue haste; but the
devices with which orthodox elderly parties
m clubs rescue their drowning country
almost always include land-dealing on a big
scale. Hence the craving to get busy at
the spending of that shadowy £34,000,000
of British money. In this connection the
favorite idea is to subdivide the compari-
tively small area of Australia which is
already accessible, and also thoroughly
habitable, into areas which are too small
for sheep or cattle and not large enough
for much else. Yet, if every inch of the
Commonwealth which is blessed with a lOin.
rainfall could be cut into the much-adver-
tised Million Farms, the' said farms wouldn’t
measure 1200 acres each. And 1200 acres,
with perhaps 12in. of rain, isn’t much of
a sheep proposition, and less of a bullock
proposition.
The Australian immigration business hasn’t
really failed. It certainly hasn’t failed
as might be expected considering what a
mere fragment of the country lias been
made even moderately accessible. There are
difficulties, of course; for instance, the small
towns lack industries, and the ports are
to a great extent without railways and
docks and inhabitants, and the land which
should be cheapest is locked against pur-
chasers and approachable chiefly by camel.
Nevertheless, immigration appears capable,
not exactly of caring for itself, but certainly
of getting along with much less than
£34,000,000 worth of loan assistance, and
even without loan assistance of any
sort. The Commonwealth has been accu-
mulating “migrants” of late at the rate of
over 40,000 a year, and if better prospects
were definitely on offer it might get so
many more that it would be a prey to aston-
ishment. It has been getting new population
at a total rate of 120,000 a year, and that
number, if judiciously spread out. would
make a brave show. It means adding an-
other Tasmania to the census every 22
months, or another South Australia -every
41 years, or another Canberra territory
every two weeks or less. The case isn’t
therefore so bad that elderly gentlemen
should give way to panic about the scarcity
of new people, and be rcadv to sell then-
freeholds back to “the Crown” too suddenly
and regardless of high price—this in a country
where only (> per cent, of the soil is absolute
private freehold, though another 3 per cent,
is certainly in process of alienation. If some
of the estates, in desirable localities, are
too large they might dissolve naturally
under the influence of a little more well-
directed taxation. Among other ideas a
heavy tax on income received as agricultural
rents has been suggested as a possible way
to discourage the landlord and tenant habit,
and a Federal tax based on area as well as
on value might be devised.
RIVETING ON THE SHACKLES.
There was a period in the history of the
Labor movement, before it was well enough
organised to have any loaves and fishes to
offer, when Labor leaders had a fairly good
acquaintance with the literature of their own
movement. They had Luskin. Carlyle and
Morris, and that quaint minglcr of religion
and economics, F. D. Maurice, to warm
and season the special pleading and mathe-
matical abstractions of Karl Marx. They
knew the philosophical case for anarchy as
expounded so blandly by old Prince Kropot-
kin, and appreciated its insistence on pro-
ductive efficiency. If the men so reared and
trained had remained in charge of the move-
wlncl* might possibly have happened
Pad the movement remained industrial instead
ot becoming political—they might have made
something out of the loss of their illusions.
At least they had some principles to guide
,! <m ‘ :lll( i the failure of those principles to
ollect a social regeneration would have made
them think furiously. They would then have
taken another tack, and, even if it led them
o another blank wall, they would have
learned something on the voyage. Rut the
people who now profess to lead Labor are
Hammering away on old discredited lines—
so old and so discredited that so out-of-date
a prophet as llilaire Belloc, whose
feervile Mate was published two years be-
J' • Bl » Scrap, could discern the trend
ot affairs and make a pretty shrewd guess at
where it was likely to lead. Belloc’s pet
abominations were enactments of the employ-
ers’-liability-for-accidents and insurance-
agalnst-une m p 1 o y m en t order. He argued that
these, in conjunction with compulsory arbi-
tration, would create a special servile status
tor tin: working-man, leading to the return
V, slavery as an accepted social institution.
1 olitical freedom, in Belloc’s view, could
c. ot . < '! uiuro in a Capitalist State, and a
Socialist State was impossible. He pointed
out that the British miners, in their dis-
putes with the owners, placed all the stress
on the question of the wage to be paid and
were quite unimpressed by proposals’ for
State ownership ; he showed also that State
ownership is illusory so long as the State
accepts responsibility for loans to acquire
capitalistic undertakings. It was another
Belloc theory that if the working folk in
any modern country were offered security of
employment and assured maintenance for
themselves and their dependants no matter
what mishap might befall. 90 per cent, of
them would enter into a life-long contract -
and once such a contract was entered into
a state of slavery was established.
At the time Belloc wrote there was a lot
to be said in criticism of his theories But
to-day in N. S. Wales, the critic has to admit
that Belloc may possibly prove to be right
The _ latest Comnensation Act emphasises
not in one way but in many ways a differ-
ence of legal status between master and man
The economic relationship between employer
and employed aimed at in this Act is not far
short of that imposed in most marriage ser-
vices and by most marriage laws upon the
husband in regard to the wife. If John
Jones, stepping out from his front gate to
attend at the factory of Thomas Thompson,
should slip on a banana-skin and break his
neck, then the duty of supporting Mrs. Jones
and all the little Joneses falls upon Thomas
Thompson. But most clearly is the differ-
ence in legal status exemplified in the pro-
vision that, if a number of men engaged on
a shearing contract should employ a cook,
and the cook should get disabled, the respon-
sibility rests not upon the men who employed
him, but upon the owner of the property. By
the fact that these shearers are themselves
under contract of employment they become
ineligible to be considered by the new law
as employers. And although the Act applies
to wage-earners receiving salaries of up to
£750, everyone knows.that the great majority
of the employees to whom it will be applied
earn less than a third of that. The whole
intention of the Act is to give the wage-
earners as a body sympathetic treatment on
the ground that they are poor and their
employers (presumably) are rich, and to
secure a continuance of the political support
of the many by this spoiling of the Egyp-
tians.
One of the immediate effects of this cam-
paign of shortening hours, raising wages and
making insurance of employees and their de-
pendants a first charge on industry will be
an inevitable rise in the cost of living, and
another, it would seem likely, is the throt-
tling of new industries and the bankruptcy of
small firms that are not well fortified by
reserves of undistributed profits. The policy
ldays into the hands of trusts and monopo-
lists, and makes them stronger. If, as seems
not unlikely, these should bide their time,
not ungrateful for favors received, but deter-
mined at the earliest opportunity to exact
from the proletariat guarantees of uninter-
rupted and faithful service so onerous as to
banish utterly the notion that the wage-
earner is a free agent, then Belloc will be
justified by events. Indeed, so far as ten-
dencies, apart from accomplishments, are
concerned, he is justified already. The whole
object of the Labor movement to-day seems
to be to ensure, by one means and another,
that no wage-earner shall ever rise out of
his class. Manifestly it is to the interest
of Tammany bosses that he shouldn’t—that
he should always be a “wage-slave” and
aggrieved about it; always regarding a cushy
job in the public service, obtained through
having a pull with an alderman or a Labor
M.L.A.. as the brightest prize that life can
hold. . But the end of it all, whether Belloc
was right or wrong, isn’t going to be the up-
lifting of the wage-earners.
ETHICS OF SUPPRESSION.
A small handbook on the subject of sex,
maternity hygiene and contraceptives came
into my hands the other day. I was told it
was one of the many books on these sub-
jects that the Law has seen fit to suppress,
which seems to me to be just another form
of shocking immorality on the part of the
Law. This particular hook was written in
the simplest language, a handbook for the
ignorant and unlettered—a class that surely
is the one before any that should be first
interested and then educated in these vital
subjects. Do we really want to keep the
Australian race as superior as we say or
pretend to think it is? Is it possible
that any of us think that to en-
courage the poorest, the most ignorant,
the most unhealthy classes to propa-
gate their species is going to give Aus-
tralia a population of which to Ijp proud?
We have a grand country, and a great oppor-
tunity of building up a race equally grand
and great. Is it to be imagined that
profligate procreation is going to give
us the best? Only by teaching the masses
that profligate procreation is a treachery,
first to their own class and next to the whole
race, shall we better things. Until we steadily
set ourselves towards a policy of weeding


out and eliminating the poorest of our stock
there shall be no improvement on the rapidly
degenerating masses of this and other coun-
tries.
What a perfectly wonderful chance Aus-
tralia has of profiting by the mistakes and
failures of others! Must we allow that
opportunity to be destroyed by a minority
of effete old men and women who have no
breadth of vision, no depth of thought, but
who are equipped instead with an inane,
soiled and weedy piety? By a wise and sys-
tematic use of birth-control the masses have
entirely in their own hands their welfare
and their destinies.
Birth-control and economics are more
closely related and interdependent than any
other factors. So long as there is a never-
ending flow of industrial human material
to work on, so long will the employing class
have the power to bend and break the will
and the endeavors of the proletariat to bring
about a state of justice and humanity. De-
spite the Great War and the resultant mil-
lions of deaths, the world is still overpopu-
lated. It is blatant folly and untruth to
shout that the world needs more and more
babies. Moreover, it is the greatest imperti-
nence, the greatest insult to a woman’s in-
telligence, to insist that the whole duty of
woman is to keep pouring a continual stream
of babies into the world. For what? Why?
Is this man-made civilisation such a grand
affair as to warrant her so doing? If we
women are to give you all the children you
shriek for, what about setting the world a
little nearer to rights first? What about
ensuring that we shall bring our babies into
a. world that will give them a chance of sur-
vival, that will give them a chance of health,
of decent wholesome surroundings, of an
education that will not cease while they are
still children, an education that will give to
them the chance to develop, expand and ex-
press themselves according to their capabili-
ties? Bring them into a world that has at
least the rudiments of just and impartial
government! As things are, the greater
number of babies are born into a world of
dirt and disorder and shortage of almost
all that makes for worthy living—a world
that means for nine-tenths just a sordid,
ugly scramble for enough to keep body and
soul together. It is something less than a
thinking human being who is going to be
satisfied with such a state of things. Then
the remedy lies with the women of the race.
But centuries of oppression, of servitude and
of forced motherhood have made women
a coward to an almost incredible degree. And
until she can compel man to recognise and
acknowledge that she is the mistress of her
destiny and her body she will never be any-
thing but a machine for the further enslave-
ment of herself and her fellow-beings. When
she becomes more discriminating and more
chary of producing industrial fodder and
“cannon fodder,” human life and human
happiness will take pride of place.
No evidence has ever been produced to
prove that contraception is conducive to de-
generacy, mental or physical. On the con-
trary, evidence seems to show that it has
improved the race. Take Holland for an
instance. Havelock Ellis points out that
in that country the widespread practice of
birth-control has been accompanied by a wide-
spread increase in the health and the stature
of the people, as well as an increase in num-
bers, since the fall of the birth-rate has been
more than balanced by a fall in the death-
rate. In that enlightened country birth-
control clinics are open to woman of every
class, and she can be taught sex hygiene,
birth-control, etc., in an open and unashamed
way. She preserves her self-respect, and
she is not driven by desperation and fear of
too frequent childbearing to the vile prac-
tice of abortion, ruinous mentally and physi-
cally. In our and other European countries
the women of the masses pick up a scrap of
information here and there—those half-
truths that are so much more dangerous to
the individual and the race than all the truth
in the universe.
We know that Australia has not yet
reached the horrible overplus of population
that causes so much poverty and inisery
elsewhere, though Sydney at least is well
headed in that direction. But why wait until
then? Now is the time to set our house in
order, to decree that none but “well-born”
children shall be born, that every child born
has an absolute and inalienable right to be
born into a home where it is welcome, a
home in which the father earns a sufficiency
to make the child’s physical well-being
secure; a home where the mother has health
and intelligence and some leisure to de-
vote to the unfolding of her child’s mental as
well as physical development; leisure to love
and joy in her motherhood —not a mother
worn out and wrecked by continuous child-
bearing, fretful and nervy and irritable with
the effort, unceasing effort, to feed and
clothe half a dozen children that she was
averse to bearing. Until we make of mother-
hood a source of joy and love and pride we
shall have the women of worth, the women
who would make the ideal mothers, posi-
tively refusing, or at least doing all they
know to prevent, child-bearing.
It is a moot point whether the mother of
19 children is not a greater menace to the
race than the woman who refuses to have
any. But it is the masses, the wage-earners,
who must first be taught to use this great-
est weapon for their own betterment. Only
by limiting drastically their number can
they hope for success in their strife with
“the master class.”

Railway Breaks and Starving Stock.
The tragedy of Australia’s mad railway sys-
tem, with its breaks of gauge at State bor-
ders and its tentacles halting at a safe dis-
tance from the boundaries lest the other
fellow should get away with some trade, has
never been better exemplified than at present.
While north-western N. S. Wales is enjoy-
ing a splendid season, with abundance of
grass and water, most of Queensland’s cen-
tral and north-western pastoral country is
in the grip of a severe drought. N. S. Wales
is suffering from a shortage of beef cattle
this year, while the good conditions are
tending to keep mutton at a high price. In
Queensland cattle and sheep arc dying in
thousands. If they could be railed south to
grassed and watered areas, they would be
saved, and would, in addition, make both
beef and mutton cheaper to the consumers in
the big southern cities. But the Queens-
land stock routes to the N. S. Wales border
are closed by drought; and there is a gap
between the rail-heads of the two States,
at Cunnamulla and Bourke, of a paltry -00
miles. The bridging of that gap would pierce
the barrage laid down by the drought.
Queensland could give still further relief by
extending the Central line north from Oliarle-
ville to Blackall, but the Cunnamulla-
Bourke connection is the all-important one
at present. Norman Turnbull, a well-
known pastoral authority in N. S. Wales,
recently pointed out that the monsoon al
rains in Queensland and the southern rain-
fall in N. S. Wales rarely coincided. Given
a rail connection between Central Queens-
land and north-western N.S.W., it would ae
possible for each to help the other in emer-
gencies. The result would be the saving of
many thousands of stock annually, with a
resultant benefit to the country and every-
body in it.
The City State, or the City Which Is
the State?
In 1925 the six State capitals of Australia
were not quite so ravenously absorbent as
in 1924, inasmuch as they gathered in only
614 per cent, of the new population (the
babies and the immigrants) against 644 per
cent, the previous year. But as the Statis-
tician had no figures concerning Brisbane,
and so credited it with no increase at all, the
position might be really worse instead of
better. In 1907 the official report was that
3621 out of every 10,000 inhabitants lived
in the six capitals, and in 1914 the estimate
was 3880 per 10,000. In 1924 the figure
was 4544 per 10,000, so the half-dozen over-
grown centres are catching up on the Rest
of Australia at a great and increasing pace.
When the State capitals gather in 6450 out
of each 10,000 of new inhabitants, and leave
a mere 3550 for the immense Rest of Aus-
tralia, they must catch up with and overtake
and pass the unfortunate Rest. The date
of that passing is very close at hand if the
present diseased conditions last. There is
no healthy or natural reason for this state
of things any more than there was for the
overcrowding of Versailles in the days of
Louis XIV., when great nobles struggled
for a palace attic to sleep in, and led the
shake-down life, for the sake of being close
to the fount of honor and promotion. It is
suggestive of the amazing bloat of Rome in
the last days of imperial glory and free
victuals. Congestion on this scale is our
own exclusive phenomenon, and there is no-
thing else on earth like it. Even when Vienna
dropped from being the political centre of
a Dual Monarchy covering 241,000 square
miles, and became the capital of a shrunken
republic of 32.400 miles, or a little more than
the size of Tasmania, the big city didn’t
become so disproportionate to the small
population as are Sydney, Melbourne, Adel-
aide and Perth. A tendency to partial deser-
tion of the countryside is natural, and has
been so for years, though the desertion
shouldn’t begin till the countryside is better 1
populated than ours has ever been. Even
in the United States, where the agricultural
life is not nearly so isolated as it is here,
people have lately been going off “the land”
at the rate of half a million per annum.
With modern appliances one man can. culti-
vate several times as much soil as in the
early, crude, “small-farmer” days. He wants
more soil to occupy his time, and he wants
more money so that he may buy things which
were unknown to the homespun clodhopper
of not so very long back. Therefore it is
to be expected that half the agricultural
population of a fairly well-settled State
should move to the towns to make the thou-
sand new luxuries or necessaries of life, and
there is nothing unhealthy about the ten-
dency except when they all, or practically
all, move to one town, and when the move-
ment is financed with loan money, and when
it begins too soon, and when the one town,
by reason of the scramble for the place close
to the loan money, comes to look rather like
a disease. This state of affairs has been
brought about on purpose, and the purpose
was born of ignorance, unenlightened selfish-
ness, the lazy borrowing habit and other
forms of mental deficiency. Out of. the 17
“good natural harbors within anything like
convenient distance of the productive country
inland,” which are all that the “Australian
Cyclopaedia” credits Australia with, only four
have towns of any importance on them, and
three out of the four good harbors which
are owned by N. S. Wales even lack railway
connection. Naturally cities are few, their
populations are ridiculously disproportionate,
and their land values are absurdly high—
not only what are foolishly supposed to be
existing values, largely based on loans, but
what are more foolishly supposed to be pros-
pective values, based on an assumed continu-
ance of the loans and an assumption that it
is possible for six towns to permanently
absorb 644 per cent, of the new population.
A remedywould be to set up the biggest of
the great centres as City States of a few
hundred square miles. Then they might pos-
sibly borrow something on their own credit,
but they couldn’t borrow on the credit of
one-sixth of a continent apiece. Their pro-
gress would certainly be slower, and because
of that they wouldn’t have the terrific dis-
tance to drop that they will have if the exist-
ing system continues for a good while
longer before the glittering loan bubble
breaks, as bubbles do. With the big
capital and its suburbs cut out, the
Rest of a State would develop some new
little cities and new ports, to be centres of
settlement, and the place would be less like
one. overwhelming egg in a single basket.

Go-Slow and Some Figures.
The N.S.W. Go-Slow Labor party enacted
the 44-hour week in 1920 and it was re-
pealed in 1922. Now look at the official
record of unemployed in the Ma State at
the end of each of the years named :
1919 .. 7,170 I 1922 .. 19,496
1920 . . 10,049 1923 . . 14,551
1921 . . 20,626 I
Immediately the 44 hours came into opera-
tion unemployment sharply increased, and
immediately the statutory go-slow was
repealed unemployment dropped. Then take
annual increases in numbers employed in
secondary industries in N. S. Wales and her
principal competitor State (in each case the
figures given are the increases over the pre-
vious year) :
N.S.W. Victoria.
1918'-19 .. .. 7,037 4,106
1919- . . .. 16,863 14,173
1920- . . . . 657 4,221
1921- . . . . 3,865 4,133
•1922-23 . . . . 3,390 7,749
1923-24 . . . . 7,408 3,537
Before the 44-hour period in N. S. Wales
that State was running rings round Victoria
in enlargement of factory employment, but
during the short-work peyod the revolutions
were reversed, and only after the repeal
did N. S. Wales recover. In 1919-20 N. S.
YVales had 7932 more factory-hands than
Victoria had; but in 1922-23, after the ex-
perience of the 44-liour foolery, the Ma State
had actually 360 fewer employees, with a
greater total population of about 600,000. If
that will not interest either the politicians
or their victims, perhaps the latter will be
concerned about wages. During two years
of 44 hours in N. S. Wales and 48 hours in
Victoria (from 1920-21 to 1922-23), average
wages per annum paid in secondary indus-
tries increased: —
In Victoria .. .. £l6 7 8
In N. S. Wales . . .. 2 10
But in 1922-23, when the fullest effects of
the 44-hour week were felt, the average
wage in N. S. Wales fell £1 15s. 6d. and rose
£2 19s. per annum in Victoria. In the
same two years savings-bank accounts in-
creased by 33 per 1000 of population in N.
S. Wales and by 41 per 1000 in Victoria,
while the increase in deposits per head of
population was in New South Wales £2 os.
6d. and in Victoria £3 os. 4d. Thus Vic-
toria had greater increase in employment
while N. S. Wales was working short hours
(in order, so it argued, to spread the work
over a bigger number), four times the rise
in average wages and 50 per cent, more
improvement in per capita savings. Yet poli-
ticians of the Lang type prosper!
*
Reciprocity.
As is usual at about this season of the year,
somebody has discovered that in a recent
12 months this country bought about
£16,000,000 worth of motor-cars and such
goods from the United States, and that Aus-
tralian exports to the land of the officially
dry haven’t been worth writing to one’s
female parent about. Whereupon a number
of persons have arisen to echo something said
by O. Henry about reciprocity—these
earnest souls are worried about the lack of
the substance. The idea seems to be that
if a proportion of the Australian produce
now sent to Europe could be diverted to
America, the position might in some way be
improved. There is not a great deal in it.
From a purely business standpoint it doesn’t
very much matter what country exportable
produce is sold to so long as the fair market-
price is obtained. There are questions of
freight charges, tariffs and money-changing
that in some cases might tip the balance to-
wards one country or another, but in the
case of the United States and Britain there
isn’t much to choose. Our unfavorable
balance in account with Uncle Sam is nearly
covered by our trade with other countries:
the fact that it isn’t quite balanced is due
to the fact that we expect posterity to pay
our debts and we consistently buy more than
we can pay for. Still, discussing the matter
from a purely business standpoint, and leav-
ing out sentiment, the only thing about the
situation to cause real concern is the fact
that our foreign-trade balance-sheet in several
recent years shows us to be in debt to those
with whom we trade. We can’t hope to
change that debit into a credit by selling a
little more to A and a little less to B. The
only thing to be done is to sell more or buy
less, or do some of both; and though we can
buy less without consulting anybody, we
can’t sell more unless somebody is willing to
buy. If the £16,000,000 worth of motor-cars
were made in Australia they wouldn’t have
to be imported from America, and it wouldn’t
then be necessary to weep over the fact that
the American farmer is getting an appetite
for High Protection and making the domestic
market for his produce an unpromising one
for outsiders to break into. If we attended
to the business of using the natural re-
sources of our continent as assiduously as
the Americans have utilised theirs, we should
have no need to grieve because they don’t
reciprocate with us. What Australia needs
is not more reciprocity with any other nation
but more reciprocity within our own
borders.

Australian Carpets.
The pioneer firm of carpet-makers in Aus-
tralia has had a quarrel with the Customs
Department. The firm started making carpets
at Waterloo, Sydney, two and a half years
ago, encouraged by a tariff that gave the
Australian article Protection to the extent
of 25 per cent, over foreign imports and 10
per cent, over British imports. The Protec-
tion w r asn’t lavish, but it sjeemed good enough
to warrant the manufacture on Australian
soil of the lower grades of floor-coverings,
such as hearth-mats, doormats, runners and
larger pieces made of admixtures of jute
and wool. There was a sort of notion at
the back of the heads of the men who made
these things on Australian-built looms that
if they could win a market for their pro-
ducts they might get a little more Protection
—enough' to justify them in climbing up the
ladder a few rungs and making a bid for
a share of the trade in the better sort of
carpets. Indeed, the success of Gattino
and Co. in pushing their wares encouraged
the formation of another Australian co.,
with a capital of £50.000, to make Axmin-
ster squares and similar floor-textiles. But
the Customs Department overlooked the Syd-
ney venture, and six months ago the Con-
troller-General told the Tariff Board that
so far as he was aware the manufacture of
carpets on commercial lines had not been
commenced in Australia. The result was
that in the Tariff schedule introduced last
year British carpets were placed on the free
list, and the Protection against foreign im-
ports was reduced to 15 per cent. So the new
company that was going to have a shot at the
making of Axminsters went phut, and
Gattino and Co. wished they hadn’t been
born. At the instance of Senator Duncan,
however, the old duties have been restored :
but in view of the harm that has been done
by gross carelessness, and of the fact that
imports of carpets are round about £1,500,000
p.a., the House of Reps, should ask itself
whether the old duties are anything like
sufficient.

Men and Machines.
“Mary Scott” : Since any stick will do to
beat a political opponent with, it is not sur-
prising tliat Labor supporters in Mackay
(Q.) should have seen tit to attack the Oppo-
sition candidate on the score of his being a
representative of the Queensland Cane Har-
vester Corporation, Ltd., and therefore seek-
ing to establish in the district a machine
calculated to take work from the workers.
The attack on the candidate is neither here
nor there, for elections with their vitupera-
tive personal abuse come and go and are
forgotten; but the fallacy involved in the
attack on labor-saving machinery is not to
be ignored in a district where a more effi-
cient and less expensive method of produc-
tion has become so vital a necessity as in our
sugar area. It seems Strange that the ancient
bogey of machines making less work for the
workers should still be extant when the
known facts all go to prove the contrary.
There is, of course, a period of adjustment
when the casual hand-worker either adapts
himself to the new order and tits himself to
become a permanent member of the commu-
nity, or, being unwilling to do this, takes
himself elsewhere in' pursuit of other casual
jobs; but the machine itself always makes
for more efficient production and a richer
and more populous community. In no Aus-
tralian industry is it so essential that every
possible means should be tried to effect a
reduction in the cost of production as in
sugar. It is imperative if the industry is
to survive, much less expand, that the pre-
sent precarious and artificially-sustained
situation should give place to more stable
and solid conditions. Mr. Knox, the repre-
sentative of the iC.S.R., has said, and the
Premier and many others have repeated, that
it will be fatal to the industry for the
farmers to grow more sugar than can be
consumed in the Commonwealth, at the pre-
sent cost of production. Which means that
thousands of acres of potential sugar land
must lie idle, and much of that now under
cultivation must either be allowed to revert
to scrub or be given over to uses for which
it is less suited than for sugar-cane. Which
in turn means that White Australia must
admit itself unable to compete with Black
Brother for the world's sugar market. This
admission would in itself be no disgrace to
the White Australian if he were absolutely cer-
tain that the competition necessarily involves a
lowered standard of living. But brains and
machinery have stepped in before now to
solve a similar seeming impasse. What but
mass production, made possible by machin-
ery, enabled Canada and the U.S.A., paying
the highest wages in the world, to compete
with Russian peasants on a starvation wage
iu the world’s wheat market? A cane-har-
vesting machine, especially if Australia is
first in the field with a workable model, to-
gether with the intelligent utilisation of by-
products, may yet bring down the cost of
producing Australian sugar so as to enable
us to scoop our share of the world’s market
until such time as other machines shall have
assisted other industries to establish them-
selves. That will mean such an increase in
our population as will enable us to consume
our own sugar or to send it abroad in the
shape of manufactured articles with no
favors asked of anyone.

The Australian Road.
If £20,000,000 is to be handed to the States
for the making of roads, consideration should
at least be given to the way the largesse is
spent, with a solicitous eye, incidentally, on
local industry. At present road engineers
in this country show a predilection for bitu-
men, which may be due to conviction, and
on the other hand may rise from the in-
grained copying habit. If the latter is the
case, the model is out of date. Large quan-
tities of bitumen are imported from U.S.A.,
which is its natural habitat. If bitumen is
the ’best kind of suiting for roads, it should
be popular in the country of origin, America
not being prone to take other people’s pro-
ducts in preference to her own. Actually
Uncle Sam’s affection for his native bitu-
men is so lukewarm as almost to amount to
hatred. Twenty years ago opinions with
regard to road-construction were in a state
of flux, and much bitumen was used; but
investigations by leading engineers under the
guidance of a national council have shown
that millions of pounds’ worth of work then
constructed by the various States has been
scrapped, and on highways to-day few autho-
rities would permit anything but reinforced
concrete, bitumen being used only for “carpet”
or surface dressing, as binding for macadam,
and where traffic is very light. Last year
Uncle laid 216 miles of bituminous or asphalt
road as against 2228 miles of concrete. One
State, Illinois, plumped for concrete, its 407
miles of new construction being entirely of
this material. Bitumen costs Uncle approxi-
mately £7687 per mile, and concrete £7125.
He owns some 133,000 miles of hard roads,
and the'sterling invested amounts to 200 mil-
lions. He has therefore had plenty of experi-
ence, and his preference for concrete isn’t,
for obvious reasons, likely to be mere pre-
judice. But Australian experience ought to be
a guide, even if Uncle Sam’s lesson is dis-
regarded. The N. S. Wales Public Works
Department reconstructed Parramatta-road
in asphalt about three years ago. Prom the
date of its construction until now it has
always been under repair, and in places is
as corrugated as a bush shanty. The same
expensive lesson is being learnt in South
Australia ; the failure of the road from Pros-
pect to the Abattoirs may be cited. The Mel-
bourne-Geelong road is another bad example.
This 45-mile strip is only kept in fair condi-
tion by constant attention. It cost £107,000.
and two years’ upkeep ran away with
£32,000. The motorist compelled to use it
is lulled into unfounded optimism and en-
thusiasm at the outset by a short stretch of
almost perfect running. This is a half-mile
iu Dudley-street, laid down in concrete about
11 >O4, which has had nothing done to it since
but an annual spraying of tar. An example
on the other side is the Goulburn Valley-

Richmond (Melbourne) is the only Aus-
tralian city which has declared for con-
crete and nothing but concrete. It pro-
poses to expend £56,500, and when it
is done practically every important thorough-
fare will be in the more permanent material.
And the material will be Australian. Sand,
stone, cement and steel—all are Australian.
Notwithstanding all that, there are indica-
tions that the Commonwealth Government
still hankers after bitumen for the Federal
capital. In view of Uncle Sam’s opinion
and Australian experience, the fact that
Roads Boards and Public Works Depart-
ments still largely pin their faith to the im-
ported article suggests that the education
of some people has been sadly neglected.

Wool-growers and “beef-barons’’ are fight-
ing one of the most disastrous droughts
that have ever hit the Central and North-
West of Queensland. For the first time in
the history of wool-growing in those parts
vast flocks are being fed with maize and
other imported fodders, at great expense,
in the hope of saving the situation. Large
numbers of starving sheep are also being
trucked to points from which relief country
can be reached. Most people are resigned
to delays in getting stock trains ear-marked
for the moving of their sheep, and even to
putting up with a proportion of cattle
waggons in which to pack the jumbucks.
But they do expect the department to carry
out its end of the contract and have the
trains on hand at the agreed time or within
a few hours of it. In several recent instances
sheep have been at the trucking point but
the trains have failed to materialise, and
inquiries have elicited the casual reply that
they would not be able to stagger in for
three or four days. Imagine a mob of 6000
sheep being pushed 50 miles along a stock
route without grass and water, the owners
employing a string of motor-lorries for the
purpose of keeping food and water up to the
poor beasts —and then to find that they have
to camp the sheep on a bare reserve for four
days and beg, borrow or steal fodder to keep
them alive until the casual department sends
along trucks! If the owner is late with his
stock he has to pay demurrage; but if the
Government breaks its contract, the sufferer
can whistle for redress. Nor do the depart-
ment’s casual methods apply only to stock
trains. Goods trucked west from Towns-
ville arrive merely some old time or other.
Tom Jones is probably “all out” to save
his sheep and has ordered fodder from Towns-
ville . well ahead of requirements. Wliat
does it matter to the Railway Department if
the stuff takes three or four weeks from
the. time of. consignment to the time of
arrival at Winton or Olio? Even if it does
happen to go forward, what use is that if
the same department takes a month to trans-
port petrol from Townsville to the same
point, with the consequence that the motor-
lorry cannot carry the fodder to the stock?

“Chemagri” : Every so-often we hear that
an enterprising syndicate is shortly to pro-
vide Australian and M.L. cockies with cheap
nitrogen, but after a casual newspaper refer-
ence the idea languishes and is forgotten.
Then some crank with a better idea of chem-
istry than of commerce revives it. The
latest scheme is to harness the latent water
power in the South Island of M.L. and
fix air-nitrogen by the arc process. The
scheme might have all the engineering and
chemical possibilities necessary, but its pro-
moters have overlooked one serious problem
—who’s going to buy their product? Aus-
tralia and M.L. are poor consumers of
nitrogenous fertilisers. Five thousand tons
of pure nitrogen per year would meet the
fertiliser requirements of both countries at
the present time. And this is not dije to any
lack of appreciation of the value of nitrogen. It
is due to a youthful agriculture and to a com-
mon deficiency of phosphoric acid in the soil.
Superphosphate—the “super” of Australian
cockydom—fills this want, and, in wheat-
growing particularly, climatic conditions
have dictated certain cultivation practices
that hasten nitrification in the soil, and
eliminate any necessity for the use of arti-
ficial nitrogenous manures. Some remark-
able yields of wheat have been taken off in
Wimmera (Vic.) during recent years as
the result of the combined use of super-
phosphate, selected seed and scientific culti-
vation, and superphosphate costs only ss.
per unit of plant food, while our cheapest
nitrogen fertiliser —by-product sulphate of
ammonia—costs 16s. 6d. per unit. The
application of nitrogenous fertilisers to
wheat has shown generally disappointing
results, so that the wheatgrower must not
be taken seriously as a possible outlet for
the product of the contemplated undertaking.
Omitting perhaps sugar-cane, we have no
really great staple crop that is likely to
absorb outstanding quantities of nitrogen.
Sugar-cane the world over demands nitrogen
in heavy doses, but 1000 tons of pure nitrogen
per annum would suffice to meet all Queens-
land's sugar and other needs.

The Performing Rights Association has
caused a flutter amongst municipal councils
and other owners of halls let for entertain-
ments by its demand of a fee to cover the
right to use songs and music copyright in
which is held by members of the association.
On the advice of the secretary of the Local
Government Association, most of the coun-
cils in N. S. Wales ignored the demand;
and Botany, which had agreed to pay the
£3 15s. p.a. mentioned, baulked when asked
to sign an agreement binding it also to
supply a weekly list of all songs and musical
items sung or otherwise delivered in its hall.
The main idea of the association deserved
more sympathy than it has got from alder-
men ; the maker of a song has as much right
to be paid for the use of his product as a
municipal council has to be paid for the use
of its bricks and mortar, and it is to bo
hoped the rights which the association claims
really do exist in law. But the demand
of the association for the councils to do its
clerking is too exacting. An obligation upon,
the hall-owner to forward a copy of the
printed programme, with a certificate show-
ing items given as encores by a responsible
official of the entertainment, should be suffi-

cient. The association is, unfortunately,
representative mainly of interests outside
Australia; but that doesn’t make its rights
any less genuine. It has a difficult fight
ahead of it; but it deserves encouragement
in its task of teaching people who would
scorn to steal a bag of sugar or a dozen
clothes-pegs that a musician’s or writer’s
copyright is something that should have an
equal respect.

Although in proportion to its population
Australia has produced a remarkable num-
ber of first-rank singers and musicians, and
a still more remarkable number who, though
not first-rankers, are notable, it is greatly
to be doubted whether this is really a musi-
cal country. Women “go in for” singing and
musical accomplishments, but, although the
population is largely derived from parts of
Britain where the people hold sing-songs in
massed formation, and where band contests
cause more excitement than Melbourne foot-
ball matches, Australian men seem to sheer
off music unless they take it up for bread-
and-butter reasons. As a result our musical
societies are ill-balanced between the plenti-
ful soprano and contralto voices and the un-
plentiful tenors, baritones and basses; and
there is an equal lack of balance in most
amateur orchestras. Further, the support
received from the public by such societies as
the Philharmonic of Sydney is distressingly
poor. For one guinea membership subscrip-
tion the Philharmonic gives its patrons two
tickets for three concerts—3s. 6d. each for
front-seat tickets—and yet gets so little sup-
port that it has a hard struggle to pay its
way. A reason may be found in the absence,
except in a few places, of juvenile choristers.
such as are attached to nearly every church
of importance in Britain, the youngsters re-
ceiving schooling at a cheap rate in return
for their musical services. Trained to under-
stand music, the boys develop a love for it
which stays. The State Governments might
help to promote a greater general love for
music by encouraging the development of
school choirs; competitions between schools
would stimulate an interest amongst the boys
individually. South Aus. has done some-
thing in this matter with distinctly encourag-
ing results. It is, at any rate, worth con-
sideration ; a love of music provides plea-
sures and distractions which may keep young
men from many less desirable spare-time
pursuits.

“Sixenate” : Canada has learnt recently
that, although it has very large powers of
legislation for its own government, it still
can’t upset some ancient British institu-
tions. The case is one of interest to all the
Dominions. A Canadian law tried to limit
the extent to which litigation could be
carried in criminal cases; but persistent
litigants, having had appeals against con-
victions rejected by the Supreme Court of
Alberta, went on to the Privy Council. The
Alberta Government put in an appearance
to plead that appeal was not permitted under
the Canadian law; but the Privy Council
decided, in effect, that no power was con-
ferred upon any Dominion to destroy the
right of every subject to an ultimate appeal
to the King-in-Council, extended to the resi-
dents in British colonies by an Act of 1833.
The Canadian law was passed as long ago as
1887, but nobody ventured to test its validity
until encouraged by a Privy Council decision
of a year ago, which declared, upon some-
what similar grounds—interference with
basic British justice—that the Canadian In-
dustrial Law, passed in 1897, was invalid.
Some sections of the Canadian people are
of course pleased at the result; others de-
clare that it is a blow to the status of
Canada as a self-governing dominion —as,
indeed, no doubt it is.

The day after J. W. Israel was buried the
Bruce-Page Government introduced legisla-
tion authorising the appointment of a suc-
cessor and fixing the salary at £1750 p.a.
Israel was the Commonwealth’s very cap-
able and conscientious Auditor-General for
24 years. During 20 of those 24 years he
never got more than £lOOO p.a. Though the
war greatly increased his duties (and his
taxes) while reducing the purchasing power
of Australian currency, he remained on the
£lOOO mark. A time came when it was
pointed out that the able veteran was receiv-
£2so p.a. less than a young man who had
started as private secretary to a politician
and been rushed into the control of a super-
fluous department, and £lOOO p.a. less than
the young man’s predecessor (himself a nro-
tege of politicians), who had been wafted
into another unlaborious and unimportant
billet. Then was Israel granted an addi-
tional £5OO p.a., which figured in his reports
as an “allowance,” though “instalment of
conscience money” would have been more
appropriate. The fixing of the new man’s
salary at £1750 p.a., which is little enough
for the job, is tantamount to an admission
that the old man was cold-bloodedly sweated
for years. In the circumstances, there
should be a grant of at least £5OOO to
Israel’s widow.
Portugal is the latest country to instal a
dictator; the cableman casually mentions
that the disturbance which preceded his ele-
vation was “the 25th revolution on a large
scale” since King Manoel lost his job in
1910. How many unimportant insurrections
there have been isn’t specified, but with a
couple of revolutions a year to keep their
hands in the Portuguese might have been
expected to cut a better figure than they did
in the Great War. Some 40 years ago Dom
Pedro, the last Emperor of Brazil, then visit-
ing Europe, was being shown the latest
mechanical inventions and achievements of
machinery at Sheffield. “Forty revolutions
a minute,” some ciceyone impressed upon
him concerning something phenomenal in
wheels. “More than we have in South
America,” commented the visitor drily. A
few years later, in ’B9, he became the central
figure in yet another revolution, his subjects
incontinently dumping him aboard a ship for
Europe without any unnecessary violence.
Yet Pedro 111., like his predecessors, seems
to have been a more benevolent old figure-
head than most emperors—not that this was
likely to make any difference to Portuguese
or Latin-Americans. Still, Brazil seems to
have made a better job of republicanism than
the parent nation. If there are some races,
as we are perpetually being reminded, which
require to be educated up to self-government,
like the Egyptians, it looks as if there are
others which have almost outgrown the capa-
city for anything remotely resembling it.
Portugal might come along with a Musso-
lini or a Kemal, but it is long odds against
her finding a home-grown one.

The Defence Department has at last ac-
knowledged the possibility of aircraft being
used as a means of attack on this country
of ours, and the Training Establishments
for 1926-27 contain details of the formation
of an Anti-Aircraft Battery in the 2nd
Military District (N.S.W.). The curriculum
includes training in height-finding, predic-
tors, height-fuze indication, the calculation
of wind deflection, observing, etc., as well
as the actual gunnery. Obviously, much
will depend on the personnel of the instruc-
tors ; there should be no difficulty in obtain-
ing the right type of trainee, as only 64
are needed. No. 1 Battery is to rank as
the parent of Australian anti-aircraftsman-
ship, and when its members are sufficiently
trained they will help to form batteries
in the other States.

“Steep Holm" : Now that Ireland has got
all the Home Buie it wants and two Gov-
ernments of its own, it puzzles me why
more of England’s overcrowded and unoccu-
pied population don’t immigrate thither.
There must be any amount of room for them,
there being 649 people to the square mile
in England and Wales against a mere 135
across the Irish Sea. Again, consider how
many people did live in Ireland about the
time Victoria came to the throne. In 1841
the census gave the population as 8,175,124
—more than half that of the England and
Wales of the same period (15,914,148) and
three times as much as that of Scotland
then-a-days (2,620,184). To-day the popu-
lation of England and Wales outnumbers
that of Ireland in the ratio of about 9 to 1,
and that of Scotland has a 5-to-4 advantage
over it. If Ireland could carry twice its
present human stock 75 years ago, and I
take it most of them were on the land,
what couldn’t it do to-day with (1) vastly
improved farming methods, (2) its own
Parliament and all evils assigned to English
misgovernment eliminated, and (3) the
absentee English landlords mostly bought
out?

“I would like to burn all the creeds,”
shouted preacher “Gipsy” Smith, “and
make a fresh start with one great brother-
hood.” Exactly! But suppose Smith
burned all the creeds and the brotherhood
didn’t start? Again, suppose Smith burned
all the law codes, and the brotherhood didn’t
start? Creeds and codes may be lifeless
things, but they have their uses, and great
brotherhoods are difficult affairs to bring
about. And if one was brought about it
would collapse just as soon as it was made
clear to Black Brother that the arrangement
didn’t run to unlimited marriage with White
Sister, after whom Black Brother hankers.
Better stick to the creeds.

It seems a great pity that somebody’s
lack of historical knowledge is to be perpetu-
ated by the statement on the base of Cook’s
statue in Hyde Park, Sydney, that in 1770
the navigator discovered the territory which
he subsequently annexed to the British
Crown. Almost any schoolboy knows that
half a dozen explorers of different European
nationalities sighted Australia’s Eastern
Coast long before Cook did, and that Dampier
examined the West Coast nearly a century
sooner.

POLITICAL
POINTS
In 1911, when the Fisher Government pro-
posed that Section 51 of the Constitution
should be extended, as Bruce is proposing
now, a N.S.W. Labor Assemblyman—Page,
of Botany—was actually expelled from the
party for taking the anti side. The gang
now in control of N. S. Wales Labor is furi-
ously hostile to the amendments, and it is
possible that poor old Mat Charlton will be
expelled for supporting them. The Labor
platform declares for “unlimited legislative
powers for the Commonwealth Parliament
and such delegated powers to the States and
Provinces as the Commonwealth Parlia-
ment may determine from time to time,”
But a little thing like that wouldn’t deter
the State Frights push from passing .Charl-
ton out if it decided he was in the way.
“There is no doubt that the Soviet Gov-
ernment has come to stay.” This was a
paragraph in the unofficial report of some
British members who recently had a look
at Russia, and the statement seems reason-
able enough. The Norman Conquest came
to England to stay, and it is there still,
tracing an unbroken line of royal descent
from Bill the Conqueror, though the links
were a trifle thin at times, especially Tudor
times. But it doesn’t look like the original
Conquest, and the Soviet Government is
already trying to look unlike the mad fury
of 1918. It even talks of recognising its
repudiated debts and paying something in
the £ of interest, if that will buy its way
back into decent society. Though the name
remains, the thing which Garden’s fanatics
want to copy may one day be as obsolete as
the Heptarchy.
Since November, 1924, Westralia has
rarely been free from hold-ups of shipping.
There was first the wharf-laborers’ “over-
time” strike; then came Walsh’s job-control
campaign, the stoppage of S’African steam-
ers at timber ports, the British seamen’s
outbreak (both fomented by the Australian
union, now in ruins), and sporadic disturb-
ances on State Government vessels. The
latest is that Australian steamers trading to
YVestralian ports have stopped running owing
to the coal strike. Another year or two of
this criminal destruction of industry and
nothing will remain of the Australian mer-
chant marine but a few oil-burning cargo-
carriers and small intra-State craft. But
the Labor view is that union bosses have a
sacred right to wreck industry if they feel
that way inclined.
This is the problem. Suppose N.S.W.
Ministers Lang, Willis and Badly, being
also directors of the Labor Daily, got
£26,000 of coal-miners’ union funds put into
that luckless literary venture. And sup-
pose the Lang-Willis-Badly Cabinet balances
the loss by feeding the strike with money
from the N.S.W. Treasury? Is that tanta-
mount to using the public funds to subsidise
a party paper, or not?
Queensland finances continue to rush
violently to perdition. Loan expenditure for
May (election month) jumped up £191,617
over the outlay in May, 1925. The expendi-
ture for 11 months increased by £1,441,162
as compared with the corresponding period
of last year, and the increase in revenue was
only £697,314. But the Loan .Council is
still functioning. Bruce is supplying funds
for the Grafton-South Brisbane railway, and,
above all, the Labor Government is safe for
three more years. So McCormack isn’t
fretting.
A committee of the Sydney City Council
has triumphantly refuted an allegation that
a Labor alderman took £5 to get a man a
council job. The committee found that an
employee had accepted the fiver to introduce
the donor to the exonerated alderman. Coun-
cil ordered the gentleman who had taken the
money to be sacked, and expressed satis-
faction at having “put a stop to trafficking
of this sort.” But if it doesn’t really want
“trafficking of this sort,” why provide that
a man must be introduced by an alderman
in order to get one of the council’s cushy
jobs?

missioner from Australia, was lately anoint-

“Labor is divided over the industrial referendum issues. In half the States it will oppose the pro-
posals, and support them in the others. Suspicion of Mr. Bruce is the obvious motive for the chief
opposition.”
First Man Overboard: “Hey, matey—grab hold!”
SECOND DITTO: “Not me —I'd rather drown. I hate the bloke that threw it in.”
ing the Yankee nation with his vocabulary
at a farewell banquet, he said these people
simply loved us and “the name of Australia
is an ‘open sesame’ to all hearts.” An Aus-
tralian girl was at that moment crossing the
Pacific to marry a U.S. naval officer, but the
San Francisco door being slammed in her
face, she and her mother went a further
thousand miles to Canada and the wedding
took place on British soil. Some Australian
public men abroad make one think of Sir
Pertinax McSycophant, the broad Scotch
groveller who was always “booing.” “I
never could stand straight in the presence
of a great mon,” he said, “but always booed
and booed and booed as it were by instinct.”
In an effort to explain away the fact that
a minority of votes gave his party its majo-
rity of 14 seats, Mullan, the Queensland
Labor Attorney-General, alleged that Labor
really polled 201,684 votes to 199,558;
majority, 2126. At least, it would have
polled 201,684 votes if his excessively liberal
calculations were correct as to what it would
have scored in four electorates which it
didn't contest, and in five which the other side
didn’t contest. On Mullan’s figures, real and
imaginary, his crowd should be one seat to
the good instead of 14. But that was a phase
of the subject which he avoided.
Admiral Hall-Thompson was asked by the
Federal Public Works Committee in Mel-
bourne whether he thought the wharf at
Darwin adequate for present commercial
purposes. “As long as there is no trade
anything is adequate,” was the bluff re-
joiner. The caustic sailorman might have
gone on to make remarks about a Navi-
gation Act which has reduced the number
of lines trading to the doomed port from
five to one; but then he might have been
told to mind his own business.
A new Sydney Council by-law takes larger
powers to prevent noises in the city. Motor
vehicles must carry efficient silencers, and
no beast or bird may cause a nuisance by
“screeching or crowing, or barking or howl-
ing.” It is not expected, however, that the
popular Town Hall pursuit of “whispering”
will be interfered with.
Recent statements in the British House of
Commons revealed that Australia and Maori-
land are, for their population, the supreme
importers of British goods. They import
about four times as much as J. Bull’s next-
best customer—in fact, they import so much
that they have to borrow immense sums from
J. Bull in order to pay him for his own
goods, and that can only mean national bank-
ruptcy in the end. But the selfish importing
clan, which makes its big profits out of the
business, whether it ends in bankruptcy or
not wants the country to buy still more, and
lies magnificently about the “prohibitive
tariff.” Recently-discovered inscriptions re-
veal that Barabbas was an importer.
Heaven knows some of the new Arbitra-
tion tribunals are bad enough; but they are
not half as bad as they are expected to be.
The other day a union secretary in Queens-
land exploded because the Court hesitated
about granting overtime rates of ss. 74d. an
hour to engine-drivers in the meat-export
trade w r hen they were filling in time ashore
during the slack season. These men were
formerly paid 2s. 64d. an hour ; the reduc-
tion of hours to 44 automatically raised the
rate to 2s. 9-fd., with double the old rate
for the extra four hours. The secretary
contended that the overtime should be paid
for at double the new rate. When the Court
turned him down he growled that he could
not get justice, and came back with a pro-
posal that a man wno regularly worked a
night-shift should be paid overtime for the
full period. When he was turned down
again his opinion even of a hand-picked
Arbitration Court was unutterable.
Sydney’s Labor aldermen have had a little
family quarrel. One of them tabled, a motion
revoking a Woolloomooloo resumption made
by the previous Council to provide a play
area for slum children. He said the area
was unsuitable. A Reform alderman rejoined
that it was occupied as a bottle-oh depot,
the owner of which had evidently prevailed
on Labor aldermen to let him have it back.
As slum kids have no votes, even under
Sydney’s dissolute municipal franchise, it
looked as if the locality’s playground would
continue to be the gutter. However, two
Labor aldermen decided that the proposition
w r as a bit too stiff, so, unless it is decided that
they have thereby “automatically placed
themselves outside the movement,” the
bottle-oh man will have to quit.
Australia being short of teachers for high
and technical schools, Victoria has decided
to import 50 from the Cold Country. For
a start, it proposes to get young people
who will take £6 a week if men, and £4
a week if women; men preferred. Adam-
son, of Wesley College, who is a member
of the Council of Public Education, and
Ottaway, a senior liigh-school master, will
help a British inspector to do the selecting.
The salaries seem wretched, but it is asserted
that there are good prospects of promotion
under the new Teachers Act. Under the
old system it would have been difficult to
snare any except perhaps a few seniors at
substantial screws.
The Vic. Ministry is finding the Town-
planning Commission, the Botanical Gardens
Advisory Board and the Council of Public
Education troublesome fifth wheels to the
Works, Lands and Education coaches. As
Tate, Director of Education, is head of the
Education Council, he is able to steer it
pretty skilfully, but once it nearly wrecked
a Government when Tate was away, and it
may get out of hand again. The Town-
planning Commission has no powers beyond
collecting evidence, but it is fighting the
Allan Government over the saleyards site. And
the Gardens Advisory Committee, which was
established by ex-Treasurer McPherson with
an eye to economy, wants more money spent
and has acquired notions of its own import-
ance. A Black Wednesday for boards and
commissions in Victoria would be. a blessing.
Never was a countrv so board-ridden.
Vote-hunger doth make hypocrites of us
all. When McPhairson was Vic. Treasurer
he lopped £2OOO off the Zoo vote. Last week,
as member for Hawthorn, he joined ex-
Labor-leader Prendergast and a deputation
from the Zoo committee in a pilgrimage to
ask Treasurer Peacock to restore the vote.
Peacock hadn’t the heart to rub it in.
Discussing a proposal that unions should
be required, if possible, to take a vote of
their members before declaring a strike, one
British M.P. urged that unionists’ wives, as
deeply interested parties, should also have
votes. It seems simple and logical (at least
The Bulletin started the idea long ago
under that impression), but Prime Minister
Baldwin almost died of amazement.
The Brisbane Trades Hall has started a
debating society, the local A.J.A. has an-
other, the Nationalists have their speakers’
class, and the Queensland Preference League
has founded a “school of public speech.”
With the older societies still going strong,
there should be a bumper crop of public
speakers for the next elections. What is
badly wanted meantime is a crop of students
and thinkers.
“Bildad”: Re The Bulletin’s remarks
about “One Sort of Emigrant” (3/6/’26) —
the man who arrived here certified as a
healthy citizen, and promptly died of every
known and unknown disease —isn’t it pos-
sible that the man who passed the medical
inspection and his namesake who migrated
and died were wholly different? Wonderful
tales have been told of personation and of
professional person ators at many kinds of
exams. Given the usual amount of official
casualness it should be quite possible to
ring the changes on our “migrants.” I
don’t suppose the Department takes finger-
prints.
Westralia and South Aus. are not going
to have the trouble over their boundary
line that for half a century worried S.A.
and Victoria. Five years ago the Govern-
ment astronomers' of each side, Dodwell
and Cur lewis, with some A 1 surveyors,
camped at Deakin, on the East-West line,
and made the most careful observations,
verified by time signals from Greenwich,
Lyons (France) and Annapolis (U.S.A.).
The boundary, the 129th meridian, was
found to be a couple of miles east of the
Deakin railway station. A surveying party
has now gone to finish the job; and the
border spot is to be marked by a concrete
obelisk. The work of indicating the line
in any practical way northward and south-
ward is left for the future.
RONDEAUX OF SURRY HILLS.

"At a Sydney City Council committee meeting it

such forms to be signed by the aldermen of the ward

’Twas drab and dull, you couldn't deny,
A waste of dingy masonry.
The very trees were gnarled and lean.
I thought that I’d as lief have been
In Limehouse or the districts nigh
As Surry Hills.
In Surry Hills one passed me by,
A hefty chap in spirits high—
Or s 0 he seemed —his gait and mien
. Suggested cheerfulness serene
And confidence that one might try
All spots that round our Harbor lie,
Sequestered, lofty, wet or dry,
And fail to find a fairer scene
than Surry Hills. .
“Brother,” I said inquiringly,
“The world for you seems right as pie;
Tell me with suburbs wide and clean,
A score or more, to choose between,
Why do you have your being, why,
At Surry Hills?”
In Surry Hills he slapped his thigh.
“Can you,” he countered, “show a; guy
A better hole from whence to glean
His weekly whack of bunce and bean?
There’s jobs galore and soft forbye
The City Council heads supply,
And never a place to qualify,
From Marrickville to Narrabeen,
Like Surry Hills.
You must have pull”—his wink was sly—
“ And here are Bumbles smart and spry
To work the oracle and keen
To turn the wheels of the machine,
For honest toilers who apply
From Surry Hills.”

There is no faltering in the progress which
has been so marked of recent years. That,
of course, is as it should be. More cover is
needed by insurers to-day, the purchasing
value of the pound being so much less than
it ivas; a recognition of the fact has brought
much easily-won business to the old offices.
And, then, Australia has added more than a
million to its population in the past decade.
Not that the merit of the performance is
wholly eclipsed by these circumstances;
there is more business to be done, but there
is also keener competition to do it, and many
lures to sidetrack the young man from mak-
ing the best of all provision for his depen-
dants —life insurance. The excellent figures
put up in 1924 were easily exceeded; last
year new policies in the Ordinary branch
numbered 10,664, assuring £3,911,805, yield-
ing annual premiums of £160,923, all well
in excess of the 10,008 policies assuring
£3.389,436 of 1924. The society moved
slowly, and at times painfully, for a number
of years, but it has now got well into its
stride:—

1915 . . 1,298,248 1925 . . 3,911,805
Thus new business has more than trebled
in 10 years.
But a big volume of business may be Avon
at an excessive price; some of the young
proprietary offices afford shocking evidence
of this, their cost rates being far too high
and their renexvals far too loav. In neither
respect is there room for reproach so far as
the Colonial is Concerned, although the
expense rate has been moving up lately:—

That last figure is 2 p.c. above the average
of the previous 10 years. It still isn’t un-
reasonable ; but the tendency needs to be
Avatchcd. On the calculation that new busi-
ness costs 10 times as much as old, last
year’s new writings cost just on 100 p.c.
(renewals 10 p.c.) compared with 97 (and
9.7 p.c.) for 1924, and 95 (and 9.5 p.c.) for
1923. Figures prior to 1918 were influenced
by the low premium rates which were a
feature of the Colonial Mutual. In that
year it brought its rates up to the general
hwel of other offices, realising that the aver-
age insurer is much more concerned with the
size of the bonuses he receives than with
what he pays in premiums.
So far as bonuses are concerned the fact
that the interest rate has steadily increased
—there was a slight slip in 1924—has
proved very helpful

The A.M.P. showed interest on average
funds of £5 12s. sd. last year, but it has
relatively less in public securities than
the Colonial. As the Colonial’s low-rate
investments have matured they have been
re-invested at higher rates of interest; more-
over, the board last year sold a substantial
amount of public securities a good deal
above book A'alues, and placed the proceeds
in similar stocks with better rates and a
longer currency. All securities bearing low-
interest which were acquired by the society
prior to the war have Been written down
to such figures as make their return equiva-
lent to 5 p.c. p.a. Of the surplus realised
on written-down securities most has been
used to strengthen the position of other in-
vestments, £49,000 being applied to that
purpose last year.

. Actuary-secretary Pullar reported £330,931
liabilities under policies—the
omce expectancy is 34 p.c.—and bonuses on
the higher scale paid in 1923 and 1924 were
declared, the society again paying the pre-
miums on old policies. The amount of sur-
plus divided among policy-holders on this
occasion is £2 t 5,243, which will provide
reversionary bonus additions of £409,000
Good progress was shown in the Indus-
trml department. Established as a feeder
to the Ordinary in 1909, it proved a very
expensive youngster for several years; but
figures have been remarkably good.

tins field the non-forfeiture provision” in
policies, whereby policy-holders are protected
from lapses through temporary causes, and
(lunng the year it was decided to make the
regulations even more liberal. That, plus
welfare and nursing schemes, has won the
society much business. In the welfare ser-
vice 17 trained nurses are kept busy, and
there is goodwill in every good deed done.
Also bonuses are paid and the board now
announces the extension to old policies in
i ooq^dustnal of the privilege granted since
1923 in the Ordinary: the relief from future
payment of premiums. The increase in
income was a record:—

Bonuses are paid on Accident policies. De-
spite the regular distribution of bonuses for
the past 12 years, the position of the depart-
ment is strong; in addition to the neces-
sary provision for unexpired risks there is
a general reserve of £21,992.
There has been a notable change in the
nature of the society's assets in the past
20 years, total funds (£8.303,951) at Decem-
ber 31 being placed as follows:

The board has been paying much attention
to the matter of premises, and large sums
have been sunk in freeholds in Australia and
other centres where the society operates.
Ihe first big step was the purchase of the
American Equitable Society’s building in
Melbourne. Last year a massive structure
was completed at Johannesburg. In addi-
-7S ll A ? ne x site has been bought in Durbau
(S. Africa) and another in London. A build-
erected last year at Albury
/If- \ ' ’ anat ber is going up at Geelong
(Vic.), and plans for other country offices
have been made. These latter are in further-
ance of the society’s policy of decentrali-
sation. Mortgages are increasing, and that
business assists to swell the return from
investments. There, are reserves against
these holdings, and in any case the propor-
tions are still moderate. Loans on policies
increased by £43.446, and that is a tendency
to be discouraged with a firm foot.

According to the accounts the profit for the
12 months was £13,328: that was after pro-
vision had been made for “depreciation, in-
surance, income-tax and boiler and repairs
account.” The erratic behavior of profits
as shown in the table is due to the co.’s
habit of making additions to and subtrac-
tions from reserves —without comment.
There are two insurance accounts: last year
No. 1 moved up £2309, reaching £56,730,
and No. 2 £7OO, reaching £19,110. The
boilers and repairs account suffered a reduc-
tion of £1994. The allowance for deprecia-
tion isn't specified. There is more than a
suggestion in the 8 p.c. div. that the term
was quite prosperous. For 26 years only
7 p.c. p.a. was handed out. It is only in
the past three years that shareholders have
received a modest increase. Also, balance-
sheet figures have improved a trifle:—

Fixed assets expanded by £lO,OOO and invest-
ments by an almost similar amount, but the
movement in those items was largely offset
by the reduction in sundry debtors. Invest-
ments at £71,693 make a fat looking entry,
but their quality is not indicated. The co.’s
progress over five years looks well from this
angle (vessels, plant and premises are
excluded) :

tricts served and the steadily-growing pros-
perity of Maoriland should help the co. to
a better position.

It was a rich year and a nice sum was
sent to reserves. But as the eye runs down
the column which shows the profits it ought
to also sweep in the fact that last year
capital was increased to £175,000 by the
issue of 42,482 new shares; also from
the beginning of the current year the
43,059 £1 prefs., which carried 8 p.c., rank
as ordinaries. On the basis of an 8 p.c. div.,
the total will call for £14,000. Allowing
for a contribution to the employees’ provi-
dent fund and refunds of commission to
clients on a scale similar to that of last
year, there would still be a fair margin if
profit kept at last year’s level. The
bonus rebate for the term was 20 p.c. of
the commission on wool (5 p.c. less than
the previous year) and 10 p.c. on produce
and live-stock (unchanged). Clients are not
likely to kick at the slight increase in view
of the fat cheques they got for the season’s
clip. Nevertheless it is plain that in order
to continue recent disbursements the im-
provement in earnings will have to be main-
tained. It probably will be. During the
12 months ended March 31, 1925, a stock
resting, feeding and sale depot at Dubbo
was bought; also a block of land at Wallan-
garra, on the Queensland border. Last year
256 acres were added at Dubbo and various
improvements made, while the co.’s big wool
store at Pyrmont was brought near comple-
tion. With most of the outlay on these ended,
the earnings should soon show the benefit,
particularly as the new store and showrooms
are right up to date, and the various depots
are well situated to attract business and
render service. Indeed, it speaks well for
the management (which has been helped of
course by the fat returns from wool) that
throughout the past four years of expansion,
the divs. have been maintained.
This comparison of balance-sheet figures
traces the co.’s recent burst of energy:—

During the year 80,684 bales of wool were
received. There was, however, a carry-over
from the previous year of 14,956 bales due
to suspension of sales. Considering that
tnere was a total carry-over in Australia
°F about half a million bales, it shows how
stable the market is that prices have held
so well. At the close of the accounts 10,961
bales were still in store. With continued
outlay on property and heavier demand from
c lents tor financial accommodation, the
co. has had to go outside for a substantial
sum. Ike current term will have to bear
some further capital expenditure for the
completion of the store and minor improve-
ments at the depots. But the end of this
activity is near, and the co. should be in a
position now to give clients its whole atten-
tion while getting a return from capital
outlay which lias hitherto been unproductive,
v n the other hand, exes, are bound to move
up; among other things not much considered
hitherto, the new Workers’ Compensation
law is going to dig into the pockets of
practically every employer in N. S. Wales.
Meantime, assuming that the advances are
riglit, the position is quite sound: advances,
investments, stocks, etc., were in excess
ot liabilities and there were the land and
buildings, etc., in at £237,389. The shares
aie now listed on Sydney l]xcliange.

This semi-co-operative farmers’ co. started
oil with bad luck, striking a market glutted
with imported fertilisers at the end of its
first producing year. That and the cost of
inaugurating a large-scale industry scared
some of the weaker spirits at the commence-
ment, and a good many partly-paid shares
had to be forfeited. Actually the manage-
ment earned the good word for reaching a
profit-earning stage in its second producing
year. But as usual with cos. in which a
large proportion of the shareholders are, so to
speak, amateur investors, the directors were
fo?, ™ady with divs., for even at March 31
±13,000 goodwill still figured in the accounts
and the position was far from strong. This

or less liquid assets were £74,238, with fixed
assets in at £434,307. Allowances for depre-
ciation are not specified, nor can they even be
guessed at while the co. is still spending
large amounts in construction: last year
the item showed an increase over 1925
of £65,968. Steady attention does, however,
seem to be devoted to the task of cleaning
the accounts of intangibles, and at March
31 only £13,000 cumbered the books. Never-
theless, so much of the value ot the plant
depends upon its earning powers, and those
powers are still so uncertain, that any sug-
gestion of hois tins - the dividend rate ought
to be met with cold resistance. Maoriland is
a favored country. Long droughts are un-
heard of and dry spells are recovered from
quickly. But there are ,factors apart from
climatic conditions which are likely to put the
brake on the spending capacity of the M.L.
farmers, and N. Z. Fertiliser isn’t in a posi-
tion to stand a severe bump. The manage-
ment _ appears to have a good grip on the
held m which it operates. But the depen-
dence on outsiders is uncomfortably heavy.

of *>4 p.c. in two years is serious. It is hard
work, though, for the management to put a
good face on things, for (1)l it loses the
atrencv for the Orient Line at the end of this
month (the Orient Co. finds the business
sufficient to warrant a branch office) and
(2) the drought in Queensland has been
more severe than was expected (of course,
drought always is). The first will represent a
material loss in revenue, and the second will
result in a heavy decrease in the quantity
of wool to be handled, with less earnings
from livestock, agency lines and general busi-
ness On top of these the co. has Dust
started building a wool-store of its own,
which will cost money and necessitate either
the realisation of interest-earning invest-
ments or a visit to the co.’s bankers. An
illustration of the smaller facilities for profit-
making last year compared with its pre-
decessor is contained in a comparison of
wool prices, the average per bale being i-o
9s. lid. as against £37 19s. 9d. At the lower
valuations now current handsome profits will
be made by growers, but those in the n. and
li.-w. areas of Queensland whose runs were
in the drought belt (many have not yet had
adequate rain and stock losses have been
heavy) will, of course, do poorly. However,
shareholders have been well treated, divs.
since 1915 having averaged 14 p.c., and there
is no indication that sudden gloom will
fall upon this well-dug-in company.
Balance-sheet figures have moved in re-
cent years as follows :—■
1915. 1924. 1925. 1926.

The cash holding fell from £19,784 to
£10,700, but the net movement was a gain
of a few thousands. “Shares in other cos.'’
returned a tasty 17 p.c.—a couple of points
better than the preceding term. As £21,660
has been visibly accumulated in excess of the
goodwill item, the co. is not badly positioned,
but some of the goodwill has gone with the
disappearance of the Orient Line agency.
The outlook, owing to the factors mentioned,
is not too bright for a term or two, but things
will have to be very bad for shareholders
to get less than 10 p.c.
* * * ♦
Paringa Co. has issued another hopeful
annual report. Some time ago it returned
to Westralia after years of unprofitable specu-
lation in other lands and announced that a
lot of new development would be done on
the old Paringa lease, Kalgoorlie. However,
it changed its mind and at present seems to
be mainly interested in a Rhodesian gold
mine, a Bolivian rubber plantation and a
Victorian coal deposit. All three ventures
are described as being things. When the pre-
vious report was issued the co. claimed to
have a share in a “golden quarry” and an
interest in good div.-paying mines, but noth-
ing is said about either in the one now before
shareholders.
* * * *
Vivien Gem Co. is battling hard with a
mine at Lawlers (W.A.). Daisy Queen Co.,
now defunct, held tho property under option
for a time, and after a Kalgoorlie expert
had reported that he was “favorably im-
pressed” the manager declared that there
wasn’t another show available in the West
with prospects so good. The battery will
speak shortly.
Borneo Oil Syndicate, whose headquarters
are in Perth, is anxious to invest the little
it has left in the West. Two experts re-
cently looked at a gold deposit there on its
behalf, but wouldn’t recommend. Other
shows are under consideration and the board
has hopes of getting hold of something.
Dr. Edwards, a visiting Boulder Preserver-
ance director who recently mentioned his opin-
ions about Kalgoorlie and its wants, has
just said a little more, and incidentally
put up a quaint defence of the
guinea-pig. Although bent the field is
not broken, and only greater efficiency
of labor and Government assistance plus econ-
omies in working here and there are needed
to straighten it. He suggests that, as the
success of oil flotation in Westralia has not
yet been proved, the Government should
demonstrate that the process either is or is
not capable of profitably treating the enorm-
ous quantities’ of low-grade ore alleged to he
around Kalgoorlie and Boulder. He thinks
the Government scheme for assisting the local
electrical corporation to provide the mines
with cheaper power would be a godsend. It
certainly would to Perseverance, which has
an electrically-driven plant already connected
with the power company’s station ; but the
gain to most of the other mines which aren’t
would be wholly incommensurate with the
capital outlay that would be involved by the
change over from steam to electricity. As
an alternative scheme a central milling plant
is suggested. Royal Commissioner Kingsley
Thomas, in his scathing criticism of Kalgoor-
lie management, pointed out that local general
and mine office expenses for the seven London
cos. operating on the field were £58,080, or
more than 2s. per ton of ore treated. Lon-
don office expenses he found absorbed ±31,091,
a sum “out of proportion to the work done
or business transacted.” Edwards, in reply,
argues that Thomas and others who ag-ree
with him do not appreciate sufficiently that
to obtain London capital for any industry
public sentiment must be considered, and
much of the expense is incurred in keeping
sentiment in such a condition that investors
will still be willing to look at mining yen-
tures in the West. He adds that, while a
fuss is made about overhead expenses being
equal to over 2s. a ton, nothing is said
about like charges which are put on the
industry by labor awards and Government
taxation.

N.T. Mica, Macdonnell Ranges, speaks
of “exceptionally good mica” being won on
the lease, and of four tons shipped overseas.
The fourth call of 3d. came due this week,
which makes the contribs. paid to 25., and
that rate gnd a little more has been main-
tained in the market. But the rich prices
for the mineral have been much more elusive
than the promoters bargained for.

Nothing very cheerful comes out of Long
Tunnel, Walhalla (Vic.). Henry Hartrick
is confident that at last the new-old tunnel is
into the formation. But the formation isn’t
the reef. What keeps the co. alive is the
faith that there is something in the near-
beyond; but that calls are to get down to
lid. a month is about all the consolation
that can be wrung out of the most recent
talk with Hartrick. Some shareholders want
the diamond drill installed. Because long-
forgotten Prof. Gregory once thought that
the drill would not work at Walhalla it is
taboo. But a straight bore ought to settle
up in quick time what’s ahead, whereas the
pick will take months.
Details are available of the seven days’
test of the New Southern Cross Motor Fuels
Co.’s one-ton retort at Latrobe (Tas.) by
consulting chemists Avery and Anderson;
354 tons of shale put through gave 36 gallons
crude oil per ton. The retort worked satis-
factorily, five tons of shale being treated
every 24 liours, fuel consumption being one
ton wood and 3301 b. charcoal. The test
was only for the recoverv of crude oil. The
refining of the crude into marketable pro-
ducts is now being investigated. Avery and
Anderson’s estimate of costs (fuel, labor
and power) for a plant of 20 retorts is 4s.
6d. per ton of shale treated.
Holders of the 10,000 10s. shares in Great
Britain, Emmaville (N.S.W.), lifted 3s. in
divs. for the half-year to April 17. Net
profit was £1403, and £92 brought in made
the available amount £1495. The Britain
plant won 315 tons oxide from 25.941yd5. of
giving 2fib. to the yd., as against 31b. from
22,S61yds. in the previous six months. At
Y. Creek the plant treated 13,980yd5. of
2.051 b. ground for 12 tons 16ewt. oxide, as
against 12,3S9yds. for the previous term,
giving 8 tons llcwt., or 1.461 b. to the yd.
The Britain plant was shifted from the back
lead to the main lead, where a valuable
strip was left previously, and a year’s work
is expected before the back lead sees the
plant again. Since the close of the books,
holders have had another shilling.

Queensland Tin, Ivoorboora and Gurrum-
bah, saw only seven tons concentrates at the
end of May. Shortage of water put the
Ivoorboora mill out of action, and at Gur-
rumbali the plant operated mostly on low-
grade surface stuff.

Jensen’s reports continue to buck Queens-
land Antimony. He has 55 tons of ore at
grass and comes south to consult the board
about a smelting plant. A bulge estimated
to contain 200 tons, of which one-fourtli is
bagging ore. has been found in the open cut.
“Patches of rich ore” are reported where
the lode is being operated in the Ethel.
Now that Willie Watt has been to Maori-
land, Ted Shacked releases another bulletin
about Taranaki Oil. The cast coast of
the North Island is to be the scene of opera-
tions. On the advice of another eminent
Yank, one Chester W. Washburne, the
Mangoapore anticline is to be attacked at a
point 17 miles s.-w. of East Cape. He ex-
pects to drill into sand in the Mangatu
formations at from 500 to 3000 feet, and
the underlying 2000 feet is said to have
attractions. Its sands contain “oil at many
near-by outcrops which can be extracted by
chloroform.” One test lot gave four barrels
of high-grade oil. Thus there is something
to set up alongside the 60,000 barrels of oil
that the Taranaki prospectus testified came
out of the New Plymouth bores. However,
other strings arc attached to the East Coast
how. There are escapes of natural gas.
One of these, by a happy chance, is near
to Jerusalem, and, if there is any luck in
names, it ought to help bring a gusher to
light from the “fire of the gods” about which
Washburne yarns. To be able to include a
heartening legend in a dry-as-dust geologic
report is good business. All this Shackell
puts into ordinary language by saying that
the staff of geologists is ‘‘definitely of opinion
that the prospects of obtaining oil in com-
mercial quantities on the East Coast are
most promising.” The drill is punching down
to find confirmation.
* * * *
From W. H. Jones, chairman of the
Netherlands Eastern Oilfields, Ltd.: —
After referring to the formation of the Nether-
lands Eastern Oil Syndicate and the fact that “E. c’i
Villa has reported favorably on the prospects,” the
“Wild Cat” (3/6/26) said: “The difficulty, though,
is not to find oil in Java but to secure adequate
title to the land.” The position of my company’s
titles is that its two main areas, known as the
Grantil and Boeloe, are long-standing concessions,
held under the old or Dutch Royal Grant title, and
are good for 75 years. The contract with the Gov-
ernment has been signed, and my company is to pay
4 p.c. royalty on the gross production and the
annual rents. These titles are irreproachable. AVe
were quite aware of the state of Dutch titles, and
were in a position to distinguish the old or good
titles from the newer unsatisfactory ones.
The Bulletin is glad to hear of one Aus-
tralian co. which has a perfectly satisfac-
tory title to oil-lands in the Dutch Indies.
It has no reason at all to doubt Mr. Jones’s
word; it only knows that if this syndicate
has what it honestly believes it has, it has
what hundreds of others have vainly strug-
gled to get. Which, of course, makes success,
when it comes, all the more valuable.

The golden age of the tin-dredging pro-
moter anywhere in the F.M.S., Burma and
Siam has continued into 1926, and the possi-
bilities are not nearly exhausted. Tin-
songkhla, a new Palfreyman production, is
being handled on Melbourne and Sydney
Exchanges, and the 64,000 contribs. paid to
ss. approach 100 p.c. premium. The co.
also allotted 66,500 paids. of which the ven-
dors took 10,500, and 10,000 10 p.c. cum.
prefs. were underwritten by A. W. Palfrey-
man. A reserve of contribs. is mentioned,
about 39,500. At Ban Din Lan, Songkhla,
Siam, a 200-acre dredgable area has been
secured, of which 160 acres tested have been
pronounced payable. A steel bucket-dredge
‘‘guaranteed to treat 144,000yd5. a month
of solid material” has been contracted for,
to be delivered at a Malayan port. Maxi-
mum depth of the ground to be treated is
given as 55ft. In order, however, “to keep
dredging and prospecting each on a separate
basis,” Eastern Tin, N.L., has been pro-
moted in 100,000 20s. shares, of which 70,250
are issued free as paid to Is. to shareholders
in Tinsongkhla, on a one-for-two basis.
* * * *
New Salak South, a Collins-street dabble
in Siamese tin, has been resurrected. For
many years the co., which is in 28,000 20s.
shares paid to 16s. 3d., hibernated with a
few hundred pounds in hand. Early this
year, after a 3d. call had been got in, options
were taken over one Siamese area of 200
acres and another of 1100 acres. “Wild
Cat” (18/3/’26) mentioned that W. T.
Anderson was check-boring a 685-acre block
at Bandon, where he had an option. On
2/5/’26 Anderson reported having bottomed
four bores to 64 feet at Sritamarat for
3ilb. values, other holes going deeper still.
The area is being worked by Celestials, and
even their crude sluicing methods recover
18oz. to the yard. “This area,” says Ander-
son, “is suitable for bucket dredging, and
has not previously been worked below 40
feet.” There is no further news about an
850-acre area in Chum Tawn, about which
much was said in the March reports. Mean-
time Collins-street has been busy. Prices
were about Bs. for a few weeks, preceding a
sudden inflation to 305., and at present
about 225. is offering, with the market
unsteady. A subsidiary, Nakon, has been
put on the stocks, in 175,000 20s. shares,
of which 28,000 fully paids go to the ordi-
nary holders of Salak Souths, who are also
given the option of two for one at 2s. Od.
on allotment.

Huey Yot (F.M.S.), controlled in Sydney,
received 162,000 applications for its 70,000
12 p.c. preference issue. The high rate of
interest fetched them. Holders of the
70.000 ordinaries who applied will be accom-
modated on a share-for-share basis, after
which outsiders will have a look in.

Chairman Kerry, of Ratrut (Siam), ex-
plained to the annual meeting last week that
about £750 had been lost during the five
months of the current year, because the
dredge had to be worked back through un-
payable ground. He undertook to do his
best for a distribution of £33,000 worth of
surplus assets in six months if a new pro-
perty was not secured. The annual report
to December 31 showed net profits at £7848,
increased to £12.312 by sale profits on Kun-
dang holding. The 1924 term showed a loss
of £8025. With £l3BB brought forward, the
directors had £13,700 available. A 6d. div.
left £10,563 to carry forward, from which
two 6d. divs. have been paid on this _year s
account. Ground treated during 1920 was
920,000yd5. for 185 tons oxide, which fetched
£27.015 after the Siamese Government had
its cut of £4941. Ground values were just
over 7d. to the yd., and working costs a frac-
tion under 4-Jd. Another 30 acres of 12oz.
ground has been acquired direct from the
Siamese Government, and present acreage
should provide a seven-years’ run. J. M.
White has been given the management, and
share capital reduced to £125,513 by final,
settlement of the difference with the Siamese
Tin Syndicate concerning the terms on
which the new area was acquired.
* * *
Charles H. Kerry, chairman of Ratrut;
and Takuapa, sums up the tin position:—
Until recent years the world’s tin reserves
stood at about 40,000 tons—four months’ supply.
Early in 1923 reserves were 30,000 tons; to-day,
nil. Visible supplies have shrunk from 24,000 tons
in 1924 to about 13,000 tons to-day, and of this,
about one-half is “on the water.” It is estimated
that the world to-day is consuming, per annum,
10,000 tons in excess of production. The recent
break in values is attributed to the unsettled laoor
position in Britain and a weakness in America, due:
to liquidation following gambling on Wall-street.
The European demand is increasing. American re-
quirements for 1924 were 64,000 tons, and 76,000
in 1926. A large proportion of this is used
in the manufacture of tin plates. Briefly—(a)
Consumption has overtaken and outstripped produc-
tion, the reserve has disappeared, and with that
has gone the stability of market; (b) the stimula-
tion of high prices has not opened up any new and
important sources of supply; (c) tin provides prac-
tically no salvage, once used the metal being mostly
lost for ever; (d) tin is a world necessity. No
efficient substitute has yet been evolved, although
the exigencies of the late war induced research in
every direction. The outlook for tin producers is
brighter than ever before, and with confidence it
may be predicted that much higher rates will rule
ere the close of the year.

evidence for the defence. The tension was
acute; stirred by the venerable medico’s
impassioned statement from the dock and the
nurse’s faltering corroboration, the crowded
court craned forward eagerly when the fore-
man rose with great deliberation at the.
adjournment for the day and gravely asked
leave to put a question to his Honor. The
Judge inclined his wigged head attentively,
and amid a breathless silence the foreman
said earnestly that the gentlemen of the jury

as it was more commonly called. But as one
who played the parent game 60 years ago,

player who had put his coin nearest to the
mot, threw the lot up, and all the heads were
his. Then the man next nearest the mark
took his turn, and so on till all the coins
wore headed. I never at any time saw pence
thrown up and bets made on the result; that
would give no advantage to the player who
had made the best shot at the mot.

“Ellae”: Circumstantial evidence is a
chancey thing. Blank and Dash were part-
ners, occupying an oflice in one of a row of
similar one or two-man rooms. A series of
petty disagreements led to a blazing row one
Saturday, just at closing time, in the course
of which one neighbor after another went,
leaving the pair, till at last Blank went out
and strolled round for awhile, to cool off
before going home. Dash sat down in a
chair which had been shoved near the fire-
place. As he leapt up, still in a rage, the
corner of the marble mantelpiece caught the
back of his head with such force that it
cut a deep gash and sent him flying across
the room, to fall face down, just inside the
door. The caretaker found him there about
an hour later, and tore out to call a police-
man to the “murder.” Under hospital atten-
tion he revived to give an account of his in-
jury, but, if he had not, the chances are that a
Coroner’s jury would have found that he
was struck down from behind with a blunt
instrument, and Blank would have been duly
charged with murder. They were both rela-
tions of mine.
“C. Bumpkin”: A depressing post-war
spectacle was provided by the craft that, were
to be scrapped or destroyed. In Saltash
(Eng.) I saw scores of chasers, cruisers and
t.-b.d’s, tied up like carrots on a string, and
ancient caretakers in charge of fleets; and in
Toulon I watched stout women hanging out
the washing on the rigging of a French
armada, while snow-white ducks swam under
the counters. The other'day a funeral pro-
cession of one started out from Williams-,
town (Melb.) in the grey light of a foggy
morning. It was our little contribution-
one of the last of the war-time submarines
which was going to commit hara-kiri outside
the Heads. Two others are' to follow, and
a fourth only evaded the same fate by going-
down like a good submarine in a storm 18
months ago. As the latest victim started
to get under w r ay a bronzed chap in civvies
came down to the wharf and stared at her
fixedly. “Did two blasted years in her, the
lurid blankard,” he remarked viciously; all
the same, he watched her silently for
minutes, and I saw him wipe away a tear as
she disappeared in the fog.
“Really”: Deserted mining
townships are depressing
sites, and little Victoria
lias its full share of them.
Glen Wills, in the Victorian,
Alps, was a thriving settle-
ment only 15 years ago.
The houses are still standing
just as they were left, some
partly furnished; even the
piano remains in the hall,
but there is no one to play
it. Near Maryborough the
train stops, when flagged, at
Daisy, where one loan farm-
house is all that the eye
meets for miles. In the gold-
en days ‘Daisy had a popu-
lation of 20,000, but only the
deserted shafts are left for
evidence. At Lamplough,
near Avoca, the richness of
the diggings drew G. V.
Brooke and other leading
actors to star before the dig-
gers, in one of several thea-
tres whose very sites are
doubtful to-day. The old
days are vividly recalled at
Bung Bong, not far away,
where the sign “Common
School” is still to be seen on
an old building. At Turnstall,
near Bealiba, only a doctor’s
lamp-post in the midst of
the forest, recalls that thou-
sands once lived there.
“M.G.S.”: How about much-travelled
telegrams ! I regret to report that 1 tell
asleep on duty one hot Sabbath afternoon
in Java. Port Darwin tried to raise me, and
then, to prevent official intervention, sent a
memo off round the other way. It journeyed
via Adelaide, Perth, Cocos, Seychelles, Dur-
ban, Capetown, St. Helena, London, Gib.,
Alexandria, Aden, Bombay, across India to
Madras, Penang and Singapore Singapore
enlisted the aid of the Dutch Government,
which sent the message via its land lines to
the little outst&tion where I lay blissfully
dreaming. I was still doing it when a small
brown object from the local post-office
touched me on the arm and presented a
telegram. It read; “Calling u 1 hour. Pull
yr socks up.”
“E.S.”: Alau Cunningham will always be
remembered as the discoverer of the Darling
Downs, but Owen Gorman, Commandant at
Brisbane Town, was the first man to find
a practicable route from Brisbane over the
range. Gorman had a weird jaunting-
car constructed, to which was tethered
a bullock. He packed his wife and family
into the convey-
ance, ge 11 in g
aboard a horse him-
self, and, guided by
a convict named
Baker, crossed the
range and paid a
visit to Hodgson
and Elliott’s sta-
tion. History re-
lates that the lady
complained bitterly
of the roughness of
the roads, and that
her lord, with mili-
tary brevity, re-
plied, “Well, damn
it. I can’t help it,”
after which the
complaint ceased.
The jaunting wag-
gym came up Hell
Hole, which the
good Commandant
christened Gor-
man’s Gap; but
Elliott, who fol-
lowed his tracks
from Limestone,
an d actually
brought his bullock-
teams up the .same
fearsome place,
gave it the name
which sticks to this
day. Hell Hole,
which cuts across
Ruthven - street,
Toowoomba, at its
southern end. is
nowadays-, a favo-
rite ..spot for pic-
nickers. Hodgson
and Elliott after-
wards found an-
other road across
the range, and their
men, with some of
Gore’s, cut through
the thick scrub,
and, with their drays, reached Grantham in
10 days.

“M.G.”: If Niagara (W.A.) in its roar-
ing days could claim “fours” in pubs at its
business. centre, Coolgardie copld at least
show a “full hand.” There were three pubs
a-row on one side
of Bayley-street
and two ditto ex-
actly opposite. But
for a store butting
in there would have
been four pubs ad-
joining on one side
and three over the
way.
QUITE SATISFIED.
“My dear old- friend, I’m afraid you’re drunk!”
“Gladsh you shirk so, old man. I’d be darned angry if
I wasn’t after zh money I shpent.”
“Rounds”: Judge Moule’s statement in
the Vic. County Court (Melb.) the other
day, that he saw a juryman nod cordially
as counsel (Hogan) made his remarks on
a case, recalls a yarn of Lawson, when
Premier, and the late Tim Littleton, who
was his orderly. It was Tim’s custom to
listen to the representations of important
deputations as he stood with his back to
the public entrance door of the Premier's
room. If a point were well made Tim, quite
unconsciously, nodded approval. If the
argument was weak or far-fetched Tim
frowned and shook his head. One day, when
a colleague complimented Lawson upon the
convincing reply he had given to a roomful
of deputationists, he grinned and replied
with a chuckle: “No credit to me at all;
I was puzzled and so I watched Tim. He

public. I noted his nods of approval and his
signals of disapproval and I constructed my
ECONOMY IN THE HOME.
“Now, I’ll tell how ire can both reduce expenses, Daddy. You stop
drinking and I’ll cut your hair.”
reply accordingly.” The Lawson Ministry
did not long survive the death of Tim.
“Light Horse”: In a Sydney divorce case
on one recent day three women described
the outward and visible signs of drunkenness
in man. One swore by a red and dirty face,
plus a boisterous manner. The second
thought a man drunk when he was incap-
able, disagreeable or exceedingly jolly—a dan-
gerous generalisation. The third —and the
wisest- —pinned her faith to “a glaze over
the eyes.” This last was the stand-by of
army quacks called on to pronounce on an
individual’s sobriety. As court-martial con-
sequences often hung on their judgment,
they usually advanced a variety of symptoms
when giving an adverse verdict. But one
and all, in my experience, stood pat on the
glazed eye.
*a* * *
“Nikko”: When a young man with a
harmless-looking parcel boarded a M.L. tram
the other day the passengers politely moved
up and made room for him, and one kind
old gentleman moved his bag so that the
parcel, which might have
been a bottle, could stand
conveniently on the floor.
Then the tram swung round
a sharp bend, the parcel
tipned over, yards of yellow
flame flared from the front
of the car, the inside was
filled with a sulphurous odor
suggestive. of the outbreak
of an unsuspected geyser, and
amid the shrieks of pas-
sengers some resourceful
soul summoned the fire bri-
gade, while kindly passers-
by administered comfort to
hysterical women who were
convinced that the end of
the world had come. Then
the fire brigade arrived and
got to work, and a harassed
vouth explained to a severe
policeman that he merely
had been taking home a bottle of carbon
disulphide.
* * * *
“Doric”: There is a strong family like-
ness about these telephone jokes (B.
8/6/’26). A well-known Chinese firm is
worried to death by the humorist who asks
“Is that Wing On and Co.?” After getting
an answer in the affirmative, the voice will
say, “Well, wing off, please.” A standard
gag in our office is to get the newly-wed clerk
to ring a certain number, which is supposed
to have called him during his absence. The
poor devil looks very sheepish on being told
lie is speaking to a Baby Clinic.

JUNE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
June carries a rose in her eager hand,
Taps with it at the window pane,
For June has journeyed from Fast Year’s Land
To stand at the door of our lives again.
May has gone out on a hurried wing,
Half jealous, perhaps, of what June might bring.
Turn out your pockets, June; let us see
What you have found at the dawn o’ day.
Have you a package of hope for me,
A ribboned dream on a thorny spray?
Or only a memory of golden years
That drifts a dust and that tastes of tears?
Your feet are white—was the dawn all grey ?
They are cold, I think, for you shivered then.
They were washed too long, by the Milky Way
And they crave for the warm, low hearths of men.
From the tea-tree’s bark we will make your slioon
If you bring us sunshine and laughters, June!
Poor June! You have travelled long and far!
There’s a rent in your kiltie green and blue.
Perhaps it caught on a pointed star
That railed the heaven where you wandered through,
And a pearl in your hair,- that might have been
A tear that the proud moon dropt unseen.
Dare I open my window for you, June?
Can’t you give a hint of the gift you bring 1 ?
'T were a foolish body who craved the moon,
But a prisoned bird has the will to sing.
If you sound the note I will sing for you,
Unlatch the shutter and let you through!
But still you -loiter in gauzy mist,
And the branches tail in the rising wind.
Have you brought back kisses, too long unkist ?
If I dip in your pocket what shall I find—
A rising sun or a waning moon,
When I bare my heart for the feet of June !
QUEENSLAND.

“Effesses”: I can answer one of “Tara-
go’s” queries about trench-fever. Lice were
the direct cause of it, as the M.O.’s gradu-
ally came to recognise. My two bouts were
each preceded by a long spell in the line
where the vermin abounded. I nominate
Bullecourt for first, champion and special,
with Ypres a fair second. One of the most
painful features of the complaint was the
difficulty in convincing any M.O. of one’s
bona fides. They generally regarded a
Digger who thought himself a victim with
a hard, sceptical eye or a wintry smile.
My worst symptom (which “Tarago” has not
mentioned) was severe pain in the shin-
bones, as though steel ligatures were being
applied by means of a thumbscrew.
* * * *
“K.O.H.” : Having had a large professional
experience of trench fever during the war,
I may point out that research work by
McNee and others established that the cause
of it was a filter-passing and ultra-micro-
scopic virus. The carrier of the disease was
the louse, common in the trenches in Flan-
ders. Infection is not conveyed by the in-
sect’s bite, as in typhus, but by its excreta,
in which the virus is found. This must be
rubbed into abrasions of the skin, usually
caused by the scratching of the victim due
to irritation, before infection can take place.
The symptoms complained of by “Tarago”
were in all probability due to a disordered
action of the heart, which often followed the
acute stage of the fever, and which incapaci-
SUCH A BAD TIME FOR IT.
“The third officer says Pamela has set his heart aflame .”
“Oh, I say, how beastly uncomfortable just as ice are getting into
the tropics!”
tated many sufferers for months after. Owing
to vastly different conditions of living and
the fact that it is louse-born, the fever has
not appeared in civil life.
* * * *
“Dawson” : I have handled scores of cases
of trench fever (B. 27/5/’26) ; in every one
the symptoms were alike. The high feverish
temperature would subside after about two
days, and then the ache set in, every bone
feeling as if it had been bruised beyond re-
pair. In diagnosis there is a simple test:
unexpectedly press the ball of the thumb
against the patient’s shinbone. If he yells
he’s got it.
* * * *
“Verri”: One of the last missions the
obliging Jellicoe undertook on behalf of
Maoriland was to invoke the aid of the
British Ambassador in Pans in an effort
to get one of the big French museums to
part with a relic much coveted by the Auck-
land Institute. This relic is a tomb, once the
property of Sir Walter Duller, which by
some unexplained means passed into irench
hands. As the Auckland Museum houses
the magnificent carved Maori house in which
the tomb originally rested, Maoriland is very
anxious to get the relic back, but the French
possessors are obdurate. Not even the pro-
mise of a Napoleonic relic—a slab of slate
which commemorates the fact that upon it
the body of Napoleon rested while being
conveyed up the Seine on the return from
St. Helena—has tempted them; they profess
to regard the Maori tomb as one of their
most treasured possessions and feel desolate
at the mere idea of being separated from it.
Had Auckland offered its other valuable
Napoleonic relic, the death-mask of the
Emperor, of which there are only three
in existence, the reply would probably
have been the same, since Paris already
has one. New York possesses the
second; it was only when collectors
were loudly inquiring about the whereabouts
of the third that Auckland spoke up and
revealed it was hers as the inheritor of the
great Grey collection. At that time the
mask stood on the floor, but after world-
wide publicity it was hurriedly picked up
and dusted, and surmounted by a red plush
frame, from which the head of the Emperor
stands out pathetically with an air of asking
what he has done to deserve red plush.
* * * *
“Panel”: The unfortunate juryman has
had one more obligation imposed on him—
the conduct of his neck came into question
the other day before Judge Moule (Vie.).
Counsel for the defendant in the matter
of a certain contract attacked its validity,
and a juryman, whether overcome by lan-
guor or prompted by acquiescence, nodded
his head. This seems to have encour-
aged counsel, for he renewed his attack on
the contract and claimed judgment. To the
astonishment of the Bar, ’s Honor proposed
to dump the burden of coming to a decision on
the shoulders of the Full Court. “But why?”
asked counsel. “It shocks my conscience,”
said the Judge. “I saw one of the jury nod-
ding most cordially when you made your
points. He seemed to me to say ‘lt is all
right.’ ’" So the conscientious juryman must
keep watch on his neck; even a frown, it
seems, may be fatal to justice. One wonders
whether jurors shouldn’t be compelled to
wear masks.
* * * *
“X2X” : Leprosy is not such a hideously
disfiguring disease as writers, modern as well
as ancient, have led
people to believe.
It is true that it
mutilates its vic-
tim s, but only
when it attacks
their faces and fea-
tures ; often its
outward ravages
are confined to a
small portion of
the body, generally
the arms, hands or
chest. Some years
ago I was present
at a parade of the
patients in one of
the largest laza-
rettes of the Paci-
fic, and although
two-thirds of them
were hopelessly
afflicted and could
look for no other
release from their
sufferings but death,
only about one in
five bore any exter-
nal signs of the
disease, and few of
these were the mon-
strosities that a
layman would ex-
pect to see. Pro-
bab 1 y the most
ghastly of all dis-
eases is tertiary
syphilis, with the
“gangos a,” o r
Rhino pharinitis
ulcerosa of the
north-west Pacific, running it a ghastly
second.
* * * *
“G.D.M.” : For an example of genuine
commercial candor, how’s this? I came across
it painted in a small, cramped hand, appa-
rently with a fan-tan brush, on a sign Out-
side a Chinese laundry in Burnie (1 as.) :
This business for sale. Me loosem money evarv day.
**. * *
“Mugs”: The High Court has been
gravely hearing an appeal concerning saus-
ages and saveloys. The knotty question it
is asked to decide is “whether the envelop-
nient of comminuted contents in an intes-
tine so changes its essential character that
it ceases to be a portion of the carcase
that furnished it.” It is hard to say offhand,
but I often have doubts whether the envelop-
ment of a human being in a lawyer’s wig
and gown does not change his essential
character so that he ceases to be a rational
bloke or cove.
* * * *
“Hamer”: The Duchess of York’s infant
was christened with “holy water” brought
from the river Jordan, which, of course,
made the job a more thorough one than it
would otherwise have been. The fluid is
easy enough to get nowadays, but it was a
rarity 70 years ago, when an aunt of mine
was christened in a New Cross (London)
church, with some of the stuff that was re-
commended to Naaman, the Syrian, for a
very different purpose. Applications for a
sprinkling with the same holy fluid came
from parents of children all over Britain,
and the water was allowed to stay in the

font until it was stinking. An aggrieved
churchwarden then managed to get it thrown
out, but for long thereafter he was regarded
as quite a profane person.
* * * *
“Trevdee”: As usual in murder cases
when the police are at a dead end, the
Tulloch crime, in Melbourne has brougnt
forth suggestions galore. Perhaps the most
startling communication was from a woman
who “went to bed wishing to dream about
the case.” She not only succeeded in doing
so but was able to furnish the authorities
with the name and address of the murderer.
Determined to do the thing thoroughly, she
also obligingly added the names and addresses
of the murderers of the Kalgoorlie detectives,
having dreamed about the goldfields horror
on the same night. Quite a handy lady to
have about the premises.
* * * *
“Mars”: I don’t know about the briefest
period of soldiering before falling in action
(B. 27/5/’26) ; but here is my nomination
for the longest period of soldiering without
arriving there. In November, 1914, an
acquaintance went into camp at Morphett-
ville (S.A.) ; when I enlisted early in 191 b
lie was a sergeant-instructor at Mitcham.
Towards the end of 1916 he arrived at Cod-
ford, Wilts., where he spent another 12
months, finally crossing to France in Janu-
ary, 1918. Three weeks after joining his
battalion, which was then in billets, he was
selected as one of a dozen n.c.o.’s to. enter
an officers’ training college. Returning to
England he spent about six months at Oxford
in an O.T.C. Emerging as a one-star artist,
he was attached to reinforcements on Salis-
bury Plain, and towards the end of October,
1918, crossed the Channel a second time,
only to find the Armistice had beaten him
to it.
* * * *
'“lan C.”: Travelling in the train from
Beech worth to Wangaratta the other day
was an elderly woman who mentioned casu-
ally that in 1853 she had travelled by coach
from Melbourne to Beechworth when nug-
gets were as plenty as mushrooms are nowa-
days. She had boarded the coach at the old
Albion pub in Bourke-street. Possibly the
coach journey had its advantages; anyway,
the old lady’s daughter, who accompanied
her, found occasion to complain of the
absence of foot-warmers in Clapp’s convey-
ances, whereas in the old coaches you could
generally get a bit of chaff in the bottom of
a bag to bury your toes in.
* * * *
“Spare Part”: There is no doubt about
the antiquity of the “Ha, ha! No shave?”
incident (B. 27/5/’26). But I fancy the
Navy has a better claim to it than the Army;
I heard it on joining my first ship over 20
years ago. The dialogue was represented
as taking place between an a.b. and the com-
mander, the latter rounding off with “Ho, ho !
Seven days’ 10A.” “10A” —-since abolished
—was a heart-breaking punishment on the
lines of No. 1 F.P.
* * * *
“F.T.”: I am on holidays in Japan, and
a few days ago strolled into a restaurant
near a bank, where I was doing some busi-
ness, in Tokyo. There was a table set for
two, but occupied
by only one, a
European, so I, at
bis invitation,
seated myself. Pre-
sently I asked him
where he hailed
from, and he re-
plied he was a Ger-
man, but had been
some years in
Tokyo, I told him
I was from Sydney.
He said he had a
good opinion of the
Australians, as he
had been taken pri-
soner by them in
the Great War and
been well treated.
I asked him where
be was interned.
He said it was at
Havre. I told him
that after my son
had been blown up
by a German mine
and had recovered
in hospital at
Havre he was on
guard duty at the
German intern-
ment prison there.
I added my son’s
name and rank. He
wanted no more,
but at once de-
scribed him per-
fectly, and remem-
bered that he was
an excellent French
scholar and held a
Sydney University
degree. It makes
one think the world
is small, after all.
“Kir”: The historic Southern Cross em-
blem hoisted by the Eureka Stockaders in
November; 1854, was not the first Austra-
lian flag; several years previously the Aus-
tralian League flew a flag very like the
Commonwealth ensign of to-day, except for
the absence of the six-pointed stars under
the Union Jack. The Australian League
was the idea of the Rev. John West, of
Launceston (Tas.), the chief object of the
organisation being to gather all the scat-
tered anti-transportation committees into
one body. Capt. Bell, master of the Raven,
was the first Australian skipper to show
the League’s banner on the sea. He had
one made of bunting, and his example was
soon copied by the captains of other boats.
* * * *
“X.D.”: “Pommy” has been declared in-
sulting language by a court at Junee
(N.S.W.), where a man w’as fined 10 bob
for remarking “Here comes my Pommy
friend” when a policeman approached. The
constable’s sensitiveness seems more remark-
able than the magistrate’s sense. I can re-
member a guardian of the peace who got a
man fined for flippantly addressing him as
“Mister John Hop” ; but the dead limit in
touchiness was manifested some years ago
when a small boy was hauled before the
Beak for whistling “If You Want to Know
the Time, Ask a Policeman,” a music-hall
ditty of that day, as he passed a constable.
The biting insult in that case is understood
to have been the implication contained in the
lines “Every member of the force has a watch
and chain, of course.”
“Swiss”: I am inclined to differ from
“Ento,” who records that “there appear to
be no cases of natural immunity to dengue
fever” (B. 20/5/’26). Forty-five years ago,
at Townsville (Q.), I had a turn of the ordi-
nary malaria of those days; it was parti-
cularly malignant that year, and few
escaped. Since then I have been immune
to all sorts of fever, though I have lived
in such tropical places as Hughenden, Nor-
manton, Croydon, the Etheridge and Thurs-
day Island. I was in the last place when
dengue first came to the land in ’93 and fol-
lowing years. I never tried to avoid infec-
tion, always personally attending the mem-
bers of my family, who never missed any
epidemic.

Now Gladys goes, one must confess,
In sweet economy of dress,
And Phyllis nought so aptly fits
As what were once left-over bits;

And many a Winnie little wears
Beyond a cloak of clinging stares.
And yet costumieres live high
On what we know not, you and I;
But here is one, it seems, would hint
A reason that they know no stint:
Each lovely lass still clothing hath,
And wears it —when she goes to bath,
Wherein at once we surely see
Of all this maze the hidden key.

met the Chaffey brothers at Los Angeles,
where they were bringing prosperity to the
future film metropolis by their work as engi-
neers. Subsequently they were induced by
the offer of an area of land on the Murray
to come to Australia. George Chaffey, after
experiencing heavy losses, threw up the
sponge and returned to America, but Wil-
liam Benjamin decided to remain, and lived
to see the two settlements of Mildura and
lien mark flourish. Heart failure last week
took the old man, to whom, in spite of the
mistakes he made, Australia owes consider-
able gratitude. He was born in Canada, 71
years ago; and he las left three sons —a
fourth was killed in the war-—to keep the
name alive in Victoria.
S. M. TOUT, the new secretary of the N.B.W.
Forestry Com mission.
Edward P.’s cheque for £lO to the dis-
tress fund for the wives and children of
the Somerset coal-miners on strike (or is
ifcloekeel out?) recalls Justice Higinbotham’s
donation of £5O to the Vic. Trades Hall
strike funds in 1890 and his promise of
£lO a week while the trouble lasted. Iligin-
botham made it clear that he intervened in
this way because the employers declined to
meet the strikers’ chosen delegates in con-
ference with a view to settlement. Edward
Windsor’s note with his tenner was a bit
more cryptic.
A varied career was that of the Cork
native who owned the rather startling name
of Art McMurrough Kavanagh. The son of
a Dublin professor, lie graduated from there
and went to Maoriland, where he was in turn
pedagogue, politician and journalist. Hav-
ing purchased the N.Z. Catholic Advocate.
he edited it for years, finally selling out and
coming to Australia. Soon he became a
master in the Victorian Jesuit College at
Kew, and taught later in Gippsland and
Ballarat. His next move was to Sydney,
where he wrote acres under the pen-nanie
of “Blad.” About this time—late last cen-
tury—he founded the Irish Australian.
Turning to politics he interested himself in
Labor matters, and, of course, had a shot
at Parliament. The busy life ended at 70.
Out of the million or so that he has left
behind him, H. V. McKay, the Sunshine
Harvester manufacturer, has provided
£lO,OOO a year to make life more comfortable
for the man out back. The scope of the
benefaction is wide enough, and the trustees
(George Swinburne, S. McKay and H.
Shaw) have plenty of discretion. Swinburne
has hinted that aviation, bush nursing, in-
land missions, education and medical facili-
ties, improvement of communications and
transport are all possible under the scheme.
Jacob Garrard, who had his 80th birthday
the other day, can claim to be the oldest
Labor politician in N. S. Wales. For years
lie represented the workers without instruc-
tions from a caucus and without getting any
payment, sitting through his nights in Par-
liament after doing his work as an engineer.
He started as member for Balmain in 1880,
hut he might have been elected in 1874 for
West Sydney only that he retired to make
room for Angus Cameron, to whom the Labor
Council paid £3 per week as its Parliamen-
tary spokesman. These two stalwarts were
the first representatives of city workers, with
the exception of I). C. Dalgleisli, who was
elected for West Sydney in 1860. Garrard
had two or three terms as Minister; and
when Labor electorates wanted only pledged
men and he was thrust out, a job was found
for him for a while as president of the Water
Board.
C. J. Cerutty, who has been appointed
Federal Auditor-General, will get a rise of
£750 a year—-£1750 instead of the £lOOO he
drew as assistant-sec. to the Treasury. He
began in the ’eighties as a pupil of Eaton,
the Baconian, who was Vic. Under-Trea-
surer in the days of Duncan Gillies and
James Munro; he sat in Eaton’s room and
picked up wrinkles direct from the head.
Banking was in the blood of R. C. I. Wil-
kinson, who, after getting a shot through the
lung in the hold-up of the Grenfell branch
of the Bank of N. S. Wales in 1901, lived on
to die last week. His great-grandfather formed
with Sir Robert Barclay the banking firm
which subsequently founded Barclays Bank:
and though the financial predilection skipped
one generation, his son being a naval officer
who settled in Sydney in the early days, the
navy man’s son and grandson reverted to
the banking business.
This has been a black year for the
Australian Air Force. On February 4L. G.
Devine, a mechanic, was killed by a pro-
peller at Point Cook. Seven days later
Flying-Officer P. M. Pitt and a photo-
grapher fell 150 feet to their death at Can-
berra. Eight days after that A. J. F.
Greenwood, a young cadet, was killed at
Point Cook. Then the Reaper took three
months off and on June 4 caught Aubrey
Henry Pei-cival, another Point Cook trainee,
at 2000 feet. The latest victim was one of
a group of students selected from over 600
applicants and had resigned from the navy
after three years at Jervis Bay.
T. P. Macdonald, scion of Ramsay, who
was here with the Oxford debaters, had
something better to look at than the receding
shore when he sailed from Fremantle for
the Cold Land the other day. It was a
credit for £4O, fruits of his one and only
investment in Tatt.’s.
George Dankel, just dead in Adelaide,
was one of the old German stock that
did so much for South Aus. in the early
days. Its names stand thick on war
memorials all over the State. Yet to him, as
to so many others who couldn’t help their
names, the war was a time of trial. A
suburban butcher, he was one of the pioneers
of the Labor movement, and for years held
an East Torrens seat in S.A. Assembly.
A quaint soul was sent cruising westward
when a motor last week slew Daniel Aitken.
Thirty-odd years ago lie left Gorbal, in
Lanark, and become offsider to the verger
of St. James’s in Sydney, where in all
weathers he stood outside on guard. He was
a live authority on the poets of the world
and possessed a pungent wit. Two eccen-
tricities were his. One was wearing “two
of everything,” two shirts, two suits of
clothes, and so forth. The other caused
grief among the dinkum Domain dossers
when he passed out. At four o’clock each
morning lie dodged around amongst them
distributing hot coffee. He had reached 79
before he was cremated at Rookwood.
For years the Max Michaelis scholarship,
designed to tempt young Jews along the path
wdiich leads to a rabbinical diploma by pro-
viding for the payment of all exes, whilst the
student puts in his years of study in London,
has gone begging in Australia, where the
Jews with lettered sons train them for occu-
pations more commercially profitable than
rabbi-ing; but this year Arthur Supeo, of
Melbourne, has secured the scholarship and
is off to England, where, after it has put
him through Jews College, it will finish him
off at Cambridge. He lets a six-years’
scholarship at the University, which he won
at the Leaving Certificate exam, last year,
go by the board for this opportunity. Inci-
dentally, he chose Hebrew as a subject, and
was the first youngster to win an exhibition
in it in Australia. Hitherto S. M. Solomon,
of Melbourne, has been the only Australian
to seek entrance into the Jewish ministry;
but, there being fewer advantages in his
day, Solomon did not secure his rabbinical
diploma.
If sassiety follows the lead given by
Lieut.-Gov. Irvine (Vic.) it will cut off one
of its pet frills in sending out invitations.
On the bottom right-hand corner of cards
sent out by his Ex. for the King’s birthday
dinner appear the simple words : “An answer
is requested to the private secretary.”
Plain English like that is appreciated by
Premier John Allan, for instance, whereas
“R.S.V.P.” would annoy him as much as
those “damned little dots” —the decimal
points—did Randolph Churchill when he
was Chancellor of the Exchequer.
When Alderman Ted Rogers put on the
mayoral bunny-skins of Hobart a few days
ago the Trinity
bellringers rang a
peal, and it was
:hen divulged that
the new head is a
pastmaster - ringer
of Trinity Bell-
ringers’ Associa-
tion, and some
years ago captained
a team of Trinity
ringers on the first
public use of St.
Paul’s Cathedral
bells in Melbourne.
VAN RAALTE,
the Adelaide etcher.
Harry C. Gibson, who has loomed so large
industrially of late months as the secretary
of the Enginedrivers and Firemen’s Associa-
tion, spent a good many years in W.A.
before moving east. One of his first jobs
was that of second engineer on A. E. Mor-
gans’s steam launch on the Swan. But he
soon drifted away to the goldfields and into
militant trade unionism. Also he became a
member of the Boulder Municipal Council,
which was mostly Labor. He w T as only
once charged witli disloyalty to the move-
ment. An aged carpenter, who had secured
the Labor nomination for any reason but
brain capacity, was standing for the
mayoralty, and Gibson had been appointed
returning officer. The ancient turned up at
lunch-time on polling-day and demanded how
he was doing, “you’re gone a million,” the
r.o. assured him decisively, and so it proved.
But the heaten candidate complained to the
local A.L.P. that Gibson had given him the
assurance with smiles instead of tears, and
there was quite a row before Gibson cleared
himself.
A link with the very earliest days snapped
with the death of Mrs. Mary Gibson, who
was a grand-daughter of parson Sam Mars-
den. When her brother, Henry Betts, deter-
mined to make a home in Queensland, his
sister, although merely a girl, decided to go
with him, and was one of the first white
women in the Flinders district. There she
married pastoralist James Gibson, and in
North Queensland raised a family of seven
children, all still living. The old lady was
84 at her end.
“D.D.” : Re quaint business names. Thirty
years ago a Parramatta North drapery store
had an assistant named Adam. In the milli-
nery department was Miss Eve. Of course
they married, and later on started in busi-
ness in the old to vn as “Adam and Eve.”
History repeated itself. For a while all
was well in their Garden of Eden. Then
the serpent of no patronage entered, and, like
their first parents, they were driven out; but,
unlike the originals, they trekked west.
Jacob IJosken, a monumental mason, has
been made vice-president of the Council of
Vic. Public Education, and will preside while
Frank Tate is away in Fiji royal commis-
sioning for the Government of the Crown
colony. IJosken has held his own with the
degreed and diplomaed people on the coun-
cil, and he has also been for years a pillar
of the Swinburne Tech, at Hawthorn. About
his speeches and his memoranda there is a
literary flavor, and a sense of humor saves
him from clashes over trifles. If the Uni.
ever starts conferring the honorary degree of
doctor of letters Hosken will be one of the
first on the list,
Canon E. S. Hughes has thrown up his
incumbency of Melbourne’s chief Anglican
high church owing to ill health, and he is
resigning from other ' philanthropic and
public positions. His recent health trip
was not as successful as he had hoped. One
of three brothers who have made their
presence felt (the other two are the general
and the doctor), he has by his magnetic
personality and organising ability kept to-
gether a big congregation on Eastern Hill.
Well endowed, lie is independent of stipends,
and can live in ease, if ease will make it
easier tor him to live longer.
Philip Collier, W.A.’s Premier, who has
been throwing a roving eye over the eastern
capitals is the western State’s first political
Labor leader who hasn’t—so far—encoun-
rough .weather with his own party.
Bobbie Hastie found himself at the head of
Groperland’s original Labor squad in the
Assembly, but lost his seat after a brief
spell as Minister for Mines, and soon drifted
into the opposite camp. Daglish was the
first Labor Premier; he lived to become a
Liberal Minister and employers’ representa-
tive in the Arbitration Court. Tommy Bath
next took on the job, but relinquished it for
wheat-growing. Jack Scaddan came along
and cut a lot of ice until 1916, when he left
the party, after a lot of balancing on the
rail, on the conscription issue. Like Daglish
he lived to become a Liberal Minister, and
possibly isn’t done with yet. Collier suc-
ceeded Happy Jack, and there are no indica-
tions that he is likely to be emptied out for
a few years yet.
William. Dickson, who has gone over the
hill, abstained from lecturing people when
he was a P.M., and they paid up or took
it out with a better grace because he spared
them that. Once, out Bungaree way, he had
to adjudicate on a Twelfth-of-July affray,
in which a fervent Home Ruler who had
been fortified by the eratur was defendant.
The court was packed and well-feed counsel
orated and orated on the wrongs of the most
distressful nation. Dickson listened pati-
ently and at the end of it merely said,
“Fined £10.” On another occasion when he
gave a decision, equally laconic, in Ballarat,
H. S. Barrett, with some heat, asked on
what it was based. “On the evidence”
replied Dickson. He was afterwards the
permanent head of his department, and was
the same practical' person there.
Henry Lawson died on September 2, 1922,
and the committee of the memorial fund is
at last getting down to tin-tacks regarding
the monument. Australian sculptors are
first to be invited to submit designs for the
statue and accessories, for which the Govern-
ment has already allotted a place in the
Sydney Domain between the Burns statue and
the Art Gallery. About £2500 is to be spent,
of which £1750 will be for the statue and
£l5O for two prizes to unsuccessful com-
petitors.
“Dingo”: Died recently as the result of
an accident while on duty, Billy Hughes, a
small, stocky, brown remount in the service
of the Defence Department. He got his
name partly from carrying a brand which
resembled W.M.H. on his near shoulder, but
chiefly because, during the Great War, he
made William the Great bite the dust in
Centennial Park, to the joy of all enemies of
the Constitution. I rode him during many
camps at Liverpool (N.S.W.), and we be-
came great friends. His manners were
really most exemplary, but there were times
when the little man could make even a worm
turn.
On two occasions,
one of them just
the other day, Cap-
tain Bill Bennett,
of Melbourne, now
81 and still lively,
has read his own
obituary notice.
When the Loch
Vennachar, of
whi c h he was
master, limped, dis-
masted and under
jury-rig, into Mau-
ritius, he learned
that his ship had
been posted as lost
with all hands. Re-
cently the Age
paragraphed him as
having passed away
in the Alfred ITos-
pit a 1, confusing
him with another
veteran mariner of
the same name.
JO SI A H FRANCIS, for
Moreton ( Q .).
The De Plater family settled in Parramatta
90 years ago, its head being a Count Lucien
who, having got into political difficulties in
Poland, escaped to England. He married an
English girl, and decided to get away from
the Old World. The children of that couple
have lived in and about Parramatta ever
since—a trio, two sisters and a brother,
noted for their love of music and of each
other. When death called upon their house-
hold they went together. Emily, who was
88, was the first to set out ; but only a few
days passed before Rachel (83) and Emilian
(74) followed her.
FASHION.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
“The house was filled with the tones of the
autumn-leaf.” —Melbourne Chatter.
Short was the fig-leaf season. With longing and
loathing
The lady locked next year at her goat-skin clothing.
“You will find that spotted kid most becoming,
Madam,”
The first man said. But she turned in wrath upon
Adam.
“It is dull as your wits,” she cried. “Where is your
daring?
Bring me the golden coat the tiger is wearing.”
Adam, strong in his guile through a year of sinning,
Lured the beast with his honeyed words to its
skinning.
“Hardly the shade,” she said, as she looked in the
water.
“This must be trimmed with the breast of the
pheasant’s daughter.
I’ll need a girdle of fox-skin the waist to tighten.
And a bird-of-paradise tail the effect might heighten.”
So Adam found his job of living and sinning
Was very largely a matter of slaying and skinning....
And he’s still at his job as the faithful skinner,
Chasing a pound’s worth of frill and a bob’s worth
of dinner.

ABORIGINALITIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES LINSEED OIL
“Jimmy Possum”: The great spotted-tail
cat referred to by “Evilo” in answer to “Anaf”
(B. 29/4/’26) is the largest of the Dasyure
family. A full-grown specimen is easily 3ift. from
tip to tip. It is more arboreal in its habits than
most of its smaller cousins, and climbs a tree with
ease, despite its seeming sluggishness when on the
ground. These cats forage only in the dark hours,
camping in the daytime in the hollows of trees and
logs, or in cavities beneath stones. A couple will
do more damage in a fowlhouse in one night than
two hungry hawks would in a week. They prefer
scrubby localities, but are not strictly confined to
these. The female has feeding facilities for six
babies, and she can rear them almost anywhere
along the coast from Central Queensland to Victoria.
* * * *
“Hiram” : “King Kurrajong” (B. 20/5/’26)
is wrong in stating that hares leave when bunny
arrives. On the New England (N.S.W.) tablelands,
where Brer Rabbit is in millions, hares are abundant,
despite the foxes that prey on their young. Poisoners
and trappers don’t worry hares much. I have been
rabbiting for years and haven’t yet poisoned a hare,
nor have I found one in the traps set for the cotton-
tails. Doe rabbits, contrary to “K.lv.’s” assertion,
do bear their young in warrens, and on many occa-
sions I have unearthed them, a few hours old, in
warrens having anything up to a dozen entrances.
“Huffln-Guffln”: Hares do not always leave rabbit-
infested country. In western Victoria, where rabbits
are as numerous as anywhere, hares are also plentiful.
I have in my mind’s eye one stretch of hilly country
where a hare or two may be seen at any time amongst,
but never too familiar with, a dozen or two rabbits.
But puss is a poor strategist. She doesn’t dive for
cover, like bunny, when danger threatens, but just
runs on, keeping in the open country as much as
possible. Her speed alone saves her from extinction.
* * * *
“Zanthus”: One of the native fruits with
which something might be done by selection and
cultivation is the wild raspberry. The Tasmanian
species is a deep red in color, looks very like a
raspberry, and has a delightful flavor. It thrives
particularly well in old clearings or on the edges
of paddocks. This suggests that probably it would
take kindly to cultivation. The N.S.W. variety favors
rather shady places in the bush, is much larger, but
almost tasteless.
* * * *
“Werrimee”: When wire-fencing started
to knock out the two-rail on the mid-eastern cattle
runs, the strainer was a roller, turned with a lever
through each end, one of the weariest tools of the
old world. Very soon bushmen threw it aside and
cut a two-pronged fork from a sapling. The prongs
were about 18in. long, and the butt end about
6in. With a hole bored behind the prongs to hold
the end of the wire, it was complete. In emergencies
it was effective without being bored. There was
nothing handier or quicker than this fork for tuning
up a fence, and fencers all over the country adopted
it with enthusiasm. It is still the best “straining
fork,” and it can be got anywhere in the bush
at a moment’s notice.
* * * *
“Black Tracker” : Calling for the monthly
instalment of 15s. at the house of a country railway
employee I found the lady of the house on the verge
of tears. She couldn’t pay, I gathered, owing to a
dreadful catastrophe. The husband, looking equally
worried, appeared, and beckoned me to follow him.
He led the way to the back yard, where a three-
parts grown emu was tied by the leg to a line poet.
“That thieving brute did it!” he exclaimed bitterly.
His missus, it seemed, had the money wrapped in
a bit of paper ready for me. She laid it on the
kitchen table and went to get some wood. The
unscrupulous fowl had caught sight of it and swal-
lowed it in one gulp. He begged me to call on
the following day, as he had sent a double dose of
castor oil after the vanished specie. I did call
and collected the money, but I suppose I must have
looked dubiously at it, for the woman hurriedly
explained that she had boiled it with soap and soda
for an hour.
* * * *
“Kriz”: Luck’s a fortune. The shell-
opener of a Broome lugger threw a discarded oyster
aside for “the crew” to separate the muscle portion
—which is dried and sold to the Chinese, who
consider it a delicacy. The “crew,” a Koepanger,
felt the overlooked pearl inside the fish and, the
white man being alongside him, it was handed over.
It weighed 102 grains.
“N. or M.”: I am reminded by “Kow-
sara’s” par. (B. 22/4/’26) of a happening on the
Solomons, about three years ago. Cattle are kept
there to eat down the lush grass among the cocoanut-
palms. One day the boss was branding his bullocks,
when a beast broke loose and gored him in the neck.
The horn just missed the jugular vein and came out
HARDLY WORTH THE TROUBLE OF UNDRESSING.
“Time to get up, is it? Why didn’t yer tell me before I took orf me clothes?”
; his mouth. The only hospital in the Solomons
,is Talagi, and the accident happened on a remote
island of the group. The sufferer was hurried into
’ a borrowed schooner and taken across to the home of
the nearest white man. After a hurried perusal of a
book on surgery he sewed up the puncture with a
i se wing-needle and horsehair. The injured man was
then re-shipped, and after a voyage of 200 miles by
schooner arrived, more dead than alive, at Talagi.
■ Ihe hospital was out of anti-toxin, but fortunately
; the dreaded tetanus did' not supervene, and the
wound healed well.
* * s *
“Herodot”: An excellent instance of the
effect of electricity on growing plants is provided
by a garden in a town in the far south of Queens-
land, One of the beds is alongside a wall. Down
it runs a wire from which a good deal of current
escapes into the surrounding ground. For a radius
of several feet around the spot at which this dis-
charge takes place the earth seems to possess pro-
perties which result in everything planted in it
attaining a growth twice and even three times as
great as any outside the radius. This has
been tested on numerous occasions by planting seeds
within the electrified area and others from the
sa>me sample outside it. In every case the seeds
in the electrified ground produced much the larger
plants. Yet efforts to duplicate the phenomenon by
planting other seeds in another patch of ground
into which the discharge of a current had been de-
liberately arranged have failed every time.
* * * *
“Diorite”: The attempt to acclimatise the
African antelope in the interior of Westralia seems
now to have been not altogether a dud. Nearly
20 years ago two or
three pairs were turned
loose in the back
countiy of the gold-
fields, somewhere near
Mount Morgans. Re-
cently a stockman
sighted a few of the
timid creatures at a
pool 70 miles from
VViluna, which, by the
way, is between 400
and 500 miles from the
coast. For years it
had been thought that
the immigrants had
fallen a prey to
dingoes and drought,
but it is clear that
there are still some
survivors. The coun-
try is mulga and salt-
bush, and has lately
been stocked with sheep by the Lake Violet Pastoral
Go., which holds a million acres thereabouts.
* * * *
“D.D.”; Artificial limbs for animals are
rare, but I know of one on a Glen Innes (N.S.W.)
farm, where a cow has worn a home-made substitute
for seven years, with apparently little inconvenience.
The animal’s left hind-leg was fractured below the
knee, and owing probably to tight bandaging the
limb below the fracture gradually wasted away. The
wound healed well, and an improvised leg was
tried and proved a success; for the cow walks well
and lies down and gets up without help. The
artificial limb was made on the farm of wood and
leather, with an outer covering of thin sheet-iron.
The socket is packed with horsehair, which is fre-
quently renewed.
“Borom”: The natives of the N.T. are not
the only ones who ascribe to certain districts the
powei o being able to bring about an increase
m the birth-rate (B. 13/5/’26). In some parts of
New Guinea certain spots are avoided by the ladies
of neighboring villages, the belief being that these
areas are inhabited by “tamarangs” always on the
look-out for an opportunity to work their powers on
a female. In other localities it is believed that the
eating of certain fruits and berries and in some
cases even of a variety of fish will contribute towards
pregnancy. A French naturalist has recorded that in
Northern New Caledonia he came across a tribe
which believed that a wooden idol, shrined in a
hut in the village, looked after the local birth-rate
and kept the population up to its normal strength.
* * * *
“Clin Tonne” : Measuring the yield of a
standing crop of wheat before harvesting is more or
less guesswork with most farmers, but there is a
fairly accurate and simple method of calculating
the result. Make a wood or iron frame one yard
square and place it carefully over a typical patch
of standing grain. Remove the ears which are en-
closed within the frame and extract the grain. A
yield of 2oz. will give a return of 10.08 bushels per
acre; 2*oz. 12.60; 3oz. 15.12, and so on.
“Buttenderry” : During the last five years
I have used several hundred tons of fowl manure on
my orchard and cultivations. My birds are fed
largely on wheat and maize, plump, germinable
grains, and I have never noticed a single plant of
either variety introduced by the manure. As to very
small grain, my experience with chicks fed on
canary seed is precisely the same. Can any Abo.
physiologist explain to me the difference, if any,
between the digestive processes of the common hen and
those of emus, magpies and crows?
A TIFF IN THE FUR
TRADE.
“Gam! You with your two con-
ceited kids —putting on frill as
though yours was the only fur!
I’ll ’ave you know my poor dear
’usband’s coat is now travelling
with royalty!”
“Ragar”: Does any Abo. know the medi-
cinal virtues of the lantana leaf? I have never
put much faith in what has been said of its value
as a cure for numerous internal complaints, and have
never seen it used till recently. A quantity of the
leaves were gathered, and boiled till mushy, and
then, enclosed in a bag of mosquito netting, was
used piping-hot as a poultice for a festering wound
made by a splintered stump of hardwood. The
treatment answered, the splinters being withdrawn,
the swelling reduced, and the wound cleaned in a
very few hours; but mightn’t all that have been
brought about just as well with a poultice of, say,
paper, treated in the same way, and of the same heat ?

And the destinies of peoples we have balanced in
our hand.
They have preached it in the churches, they have
taught it in the schools;
It’s the slogan of the sages and the byword of the
fools.
But the teachers and the preachers never know or
understand
All the hard and bitter struggles of the people on
the land.
Oh! we’ve dreamed and schemed and fretted as we
trudged behind the plough;
And we’ve built some airy castles as the sweat
dripped from our brow.
We have peeped into the future and some fine mirages
seen,
Dreamed we loved and lived in leisure likp the people
on the screen.
\es, our missus Wore a costume without rent or
crease or soil —
God, her poor old skin is fading to the color of
the soil!
We have seen the sweet rain falling on the fields that
we have sown,
And in fancy reaped a harvest ere the first green
ears have shown;
And we’ve heard the humming header and we’ve seen
the bulging bags,
We have visited the tailor, cast aside our outworn
rags ;
And we’ve heard the crisp notes rustle —almost felt
them in our hand—
As the phantom wheat went racing like a stream of
golden sand!
THE MANNERS OF THE CITY.
DAD (reading) : “ ‘The table waft Hid with
eighteen covers .’ My word, Mum, them
city blokes must spill a lot on the cloth
when they're eatin’.”
Now our girls are getting restless. It’s no wonder
that they frown.
Well we know that they have listened to the calling
of the town.
They are craving for the glitter and the hurry of the
throng,
For the magic of the music and the laughter and
the song
In the place where youth and pleasure go like
children, hand in hand
With a jeer or smile of pity for the people on the
land.
One by one the boys have left us. They have drifted
with the flood;
And the ceaseless quest of pleasure is like fever in
their blood.
Open plains are lost romances and the bush has shed
its charm,
While the heavy-footed pommies take their places on
the farm.
And the middlemen and pressmen skite or write that
life is grand—
Just a blend of milk and honey for the people on the
land.
We have peeped into the future; and we’ve hastily
looked back
To the hard old times behind us, when our fathers
blazed the track,
When we all slept on the waggon and our sleep was
sweet and sound,
And our mothers cooked their dinners at a camp-fire
on the ground.
IVhen their washing-up was finished they would come
and lend a hand
At the drilling or the tilling as we grappled with
the land.
There is hair within our nostrils and a tuft grows
in our ears.
We’ve a beard that’s grey and grizzled—it has not
been trimmed for years.
Life seems furrow after furrow without halt or break
or bend,
Making ready for the harvest, of the Reaper at the
end;
And the teachers and the preachers do not know or
understand
Of the hopes, like sunken treasure, that are buried in
the land!
N.S.W.

Say WHEN Man!!
Ivriz” ; The pearl recovered by the mate
of “Jim Carew” (B. 8/4/’26) recalls a similar
happening on the Ninety Mile Beach, Nor’-Westralia.
A man opening shell on his own lugger picked out a
pearl and was in the act of washing the slime away
in a bucket of water when the treasure slipped out
of his hand, bounced on the deck and went overboard.
The lugger happened to be sailing at the time, and
the old chap, being a quick thinker, threw one of
the native crew overboard and followed up by
pitching the leadline also. Both marked the spot.
The Japanese diver was promised £25 if the pearl
was recovered. He was below nine minutes altogether
and returned with the pearl. It weighed 47 grains
when put on the scales and was sold in Broome for
£lO6O.
* * * *
‘‘Zanthus”: When, where and by whom
was ling-barking first applied on a large scale in
Australia ? It was known in quite early days. J.
Atkinson, writing in 1820, mentions that in clear-
ing land some ringed the big trees; and J. L. Stokes
talks of ring-barking in 1846. It seems, however, to
have been about 1860 before the practice of ringing
bush land by pastoralists came into popular use.
According to the late \V. E. Abbott, Thomas Hunger-
lord, of Burcaami, was the first to ring-bark in the
Hunter River country. His example was quickly
followed by the Messrs. White, and became general
in the course of the next dozen years.
* * * *
l 'Fana”: A bullock killed recently at
Orange (N.S.W.) was found to possess three kidneys,
the superfluous one being set a little behind
the other two. The three organs were embedded
in a tremendous amount of fat, tlie total weight
of which was nearly 1501 b. This is believed to
be the first instance of such a thing in cattle,
although the duplication of one or two of the other
jrgans has been known at different times not only in
cattle but also in horses and sheep.
* * * *
“Bilby” : Binghi, when stung by the Por-
tuguese man-o’-war, the most dangerous of the many
species of jellyfish in Barrier Reef waters, finds
a simple remedy close at hand. Wading out of the
water, he searches the shrubbery along the shore
until he finds a clump of pigfaee-weed. He then
crushes some of the leaves in his hands and rubs
them on the wales. The effect is rapid and, Binghi
declares, infallible. Probably it is the soda in
which the weed is so rich that gives it efficacy.
* * * *
“Gouger”: In Cape York Peninsula
Binghi’s education as a tracker begins even before
lie can crawl. At any well-defined track of beast or
bird the kids in arms are halted and shown it
and the animal that made it. This practice im-
presses the teaching on a memory that subsequently
never fails. When he crawls, his parents draw
around him ’roo, emu and goanna tracks, each
playful lesson having its value in the hard years
to come. Soon after the toddling stage the picca-
ninny’s education becomes intensive. Game brought
into camp is dumped on the ground so that the
child may recognise it and associate it with its
track. If the animal be a tree climber, its claws
are made to scratch bark; if a burrower, then dad
makes it nose the earth; if in the .habit of shelter-
ing in hollow logs, the body is pushed into one
and the child shown the betraying hairs that adhere
to the wood. When the victim is a bird, its
tracks are marked on the ground. He is shown the
honey-gathering bees, and one is caught, a fluff of
white bird-down gummed to it, and the bee liber-
ated. The piccaninny is run along, the big brown
eyes gazing upward at the tiny speck of white that
makes unerringly for an almost invisible hole in
A LONG JOB.

a tree. the kid’s ear is put to the tree trunk,
where he hears the tiny vibrations and ever after-
wards recognises the cause. By the time he can
throw his first reed spear he and his companions
at play can track lizards, birds, frogs and the
living things that touch the ground. By a glance
at a minute scratch on hard soil he will tell what
creature is responsible for it, whether it is a fresh or
old track, whither its maker was going; and often
its sex. Little wonder that at manhood the book
of nature lies open before him.
“Ess”: Bogan’s mate was grumbling about
the cold and Bogan’s inattention to the camp-fire
through the night. “Why don’t you put yourself
in a bag?” said Bogan. “I always do when it’s
cold.” He rolled himself in his blankets, then got
into a big wheat-bag, feet first, and lay like a huge
stick-grub in its case, proof against wind and frost.
“When I’ve retired,” he mumbled from under his
hat, “you can’t expect me to be gettin’ up to put
a bit of wood on the fire. 1 don’t want fires.”

“Harold Hardupp” : A sharp-eyed assistant
keeper at Taronga Park confirms the results of recent
research. Chancing on
an occasion of marsu-
pial birth, he called up
three other persons to
be witnesses with him
of the happening. The
facts observed bv them
were set out in a de-
claration signed by the
four and handed to the
Taronga Park Trust.
According to their
observation, the foetus,
which later on be-
comes the infant mar-
supial, by use of the
fore-limbs, which arc
its earliest developed
features, works its way
through the mother’s
fur to the pouch, into
which it falls, immedi-
ately fastening on the
teat. This curious
variation of the pro-
cess of birth is made
necessary by the
absence of the placenta,
which in the higher
mammals enables the
foetus to , receive food
and oxygen from the
maternal blood-stream,
and accounts for ioeys
in an immature state
being found on the tear
of slaughtered kan-
garoos. Dr. Barton, iri
the “Annals of Philo-
sophy," issued in 1823,
published some obser-
vations about a similar
happening regarding
American opossums.
He likens the new-
“born” young to mag-
gots, and says that
they work their wav
through the fur to the
mother’s teats “by the
power of the invariable
and determinate in-
stinct."
“Shollum”: A valuable mare owned by
Walter Smith, of Otiake (M.L.), was gored by a
bull and died. A month-old foal she had at foot
was then turned out with a dry mare six years old
running in a paddock. The foal started sucking
the mare, and in a few days drew a plentiful supply
of milk. She is still going strong with her foster-
mother.
* * * *
“Gregor” : The capacity for being able to
die by the voluntary exercise of will is not con-
fined to primitive colored races. Some years ago
a Frenchman, a patient in the Thursday Island
hospital, suffering from a. form of paralysis that
left him helpless, de-
termined to die in a
few days’ time. His
demise duly came about
on the day that he had
mentioned. In a Mel-
bourne hospital about
20 years ago the same
thing happened to a
young immigrant with
whom there was noth-
ing Wrong except a
minor complaint from
which he would have
recovered in a couple
of weeks. In an Eng-
lish case on record the
subject was a man
serving a long prison
sentence, who appa-
rently succeeded in in-
ducing his own death.
He was perfectly
healthy and sound
organically, but in
spite of every effort to
save him he died. Prob-
ably the faculty is a
form of intense mental
concentration more
likely to exist in a
simple mind than in
a well-developed one.
“G.1.H.”: Re Underwood’s “antidote for
snake poison.” When going to the Hutchins school
in Hobart, 40 years ago, I often passed a place in
Argyle-street, near the wharf, where Underwood
lived. It was a queer house, some 20 feet or
more below the street, and was covered by green
creepers with several large trees growing near by.
Looking down on the place one could see a small
notice: “Underwood’s Antidote for Snake Poison.”
I mentioned the fact to my uncle, who stated that
the specific was made from dockweed (Rumex
specified), of which plenty grew in the fields after
the wheat was cut down. This weed is one of the
dozen or more that have been mentioned as the
vegetable the goanna always makes for after a
snakebite.
* * * *
“Wang” : The other day a carpenter was
examining with me a small gum-tree in our depot
yard, the bark of which had grown right over a
chain that had been fastened around it two or three
years before. He unburdened himself then of the
following item. Amongst his tools of trade was
THE POWER OF THE PRESS.
“I didn't conic to see you when you were ill, hut I knew hy the
papers you were doin' all right."
"By the papers?"
“Yes, I used to look at the undertakers’ advertisements every day."
a chisel with a hickory handle, which he had had
for years. One day when ■ belting- at the chisel
with a mallet, the steel ring around the top flew
off, and the handle split in two. In the centre of
it he found a small rifle bullet.; Some hunter in
an American forest had fired that shot, the - bullet
embedding itself in the hickory-tree, and in course
of time the wood had formed around it.
* * * *
“Murchison”: Here’s an infinite capacity
for taking- pains, if you like. At a bazaar held at
Day Dawn (W.A.) in aid of a charity the weight
of a fair-sized sheep had to be judged. The entrance-
fee was 6d. a guess, and the sheep was the prize.
One old lady, after carefully scrutinising the exhibit
to get an exact mental picture. of its size, climbed
into her sulky and drove home —about a mile outside
the town—where she had a small flock of goats. Care-
fully picking out the one she judged to be nearest
the size of the sheep, and allowing for the fleece,
she weighed it; then drove back to the bazaar and
registered her guess. She won the prize.
* * * *
“Viator”: A Gympie (Q.) timber-getter,
out for pine in the neighboring hills, discovered a fine
specimen rooted deep down in an old mine-shaft. The
trunk alone yielded 3000 ft. of valuable timber. This
particular mine was sunk and abandoned in the
very early days of Gympie, so that the tree had
probably 50 or 60 years to its credit. Assuming
this to represent a fair average of growth for a
pine, there should be plenty of money in forestry
in Queensland. Yet huge stacks of imported oregon
are to be seen in the timber-yards of Brisbane.
* * * *
“Jim Carew”: Had “Two Seas” (B.
13/5/’26) read carefully the note on the passing-off
of hand-made dingo tails he would have seen that
it referred to stations paying the 10s. bonus them-
selves. The swindle referred to was worked on a nor’-
weStern N.S.W. station towjied at that time by an
Englishman and managed-Cy a fellow exile imported
for the job. In all probability he would never have
noticed the deception had not another employer
accidentally drawn his attention to it. A yarn with
a few old-time bushmen would quickly convince
“Two Seas” that the swindle was not only practicable,
but was fairly extensively worked.
“The Jumper”: It is only where there are dis-
honest or mug receivers that faked dingo tails can
be passed in (B. 22/4/’26). With an honest man
who knows his business it would be just as hard to
get past with a spurious canine rudder as it would
be to pass in a horse-hide for a bullock-robe with
the average dealer. Warrigal’s “waver” differs
from the ordinary tyke’s rear-end appendage in that
it is a bottle-brush affair, the hair at the end being
equfdly distributed all round, the bulk not being
attached to the under side as in the case of the
common barker. Then the bush-howler’s brush is
Neiy biistly, so much so that an experienced person
blindfolded could pick one out of a collection of a
hundred ordinary tyke tails. In the case of domestic
dogs gone bush, it is altogether a different matter.
Heiodot : Despite the precaution of paying
bonuses for dingoes only when the mask and tail
are presented in one piece (B. 13/5/’26), many
swindles have been worked. Some years ago in
W.Q., when full-grown dingoes were worth as much
as £lO and £l2, an artist succeeded in making
counterfeits of the head-and-tail piece out of the
skins of other animals, and got paid for a fair number
before somebody, awoke to the trick. As for the
assertion of “Two Seas” that it is not possible to
take in the receivers of noxious animals’ scalps, it
is not very long since in Bananaland a number of
ordinary dogs’ scalps were paid for in the belief
that they had come from warrigals, the swindler
collecting and getting a start of some weeks before
his sin was discovered.
* * * *
“►S.(V : Of all the foreign birds liberated
in Australia since about 187 U only the Indian turtle-
dove (common about Sydney), the starling, house
sparrow, hedge-sparrow (a little smaller than the
other), blackbird, goldfinch, greenfinch, skylark (in
a few quarters only) and, latterly, the crested-bulbul
of India have made good. All the others have dis-
appeared, being unable, probably, to cope with a
new body of natural enemies, including hawks and
their kind, native cats, foxes, and the domestic
tabby turned bushranger. Many years ago some
i.riglish wild ducks (Anas boschas') were turned
loose in Victoria and these in hybrid form —having
crossed with the black or brown duck (Anas super-
cihosa) are said to still exist. The feather-Kl
immigrants included some batches of canaries, but
these delicate birds never gained a footing.
* * * *
“Nitric”: The question of tlie relative
toxicity of Australian snakes and those of other
lands has lately been settled scientifically. Previ-
ously the palm , was always awarded to the death-
adder, but by recent tests the tiger-snake has been
shown to be the more venomous. Compared with
the Indian cobra, the deadly properties of its ooison
are, having regard to weight and size, as 5 is to -2,
and with the American rattle-snake as 4 is to 3. A
compensating fact is that the tiger-snake’s venom is-
slower m action than that of either of the other two.
The death-adder’s poison on the other hand is swifter’
than any of them. However, Australia’s reputation
is saved by the fact that her poisonous snakes are
much less numerous than India’s or America’s.
“Cartot”: The common rat, in addition to
being a disease-carrier, starts more fires than he is
ever debited with. In many buildings the wires
carrying light and power run under floors or over ceil-
ings, and with the omnivorous instincts of his tribe,
the rat often eats away the insulations, with the
result that the highly-charged wires are left bare.
Should the cables subsequently fuse, there is another
mysterious outbreak, and as the seat of the blaze
is generally in some inaccessible spot the premises
are usually well alight before the fire is discovered.
One American underwriting company is insisting that
the insulation on all cables of the kind shall contain
some- rat-poison.
* * * *
“Wang” : A dweller in a Victorian coun-
try town owns a cockatoo that helps to keep the
home fires burning. The back yard of his owner’s
premises abuts on the rail way-line, about 100 yards
from the station, and several times a day goods
and passenger trains go by. Cocky has been taught
to sit on the back fence and screech “Go it, y’ black
blanks!” to the driver and his assistant in the
passing engines. The result is a pot-shot taken
CALLING HIM BACK TO BUSINESS.
HARDUP (who has received sixpence from
the gentleman): “Thanh ye, sir. May
the angels pay ye hack a hundred-fold!”
SPONSKI: “Vat! Only two pounds ten after
takin' a risk like that!”
at him with a lump of coal. The fuel-provider has
more than once been knocked off his perch, but
without suffering serious damage in person or in
zeal. His owner has been offered some good prices
for cocky by other people whose back yards abut
on the line, but he’s not a seller.

pping device you get the keenest and most
perfect shaving edge it is possible to get
on a razor. It is simplicity in itself. No

The A.J.C. wished George V. many happy
returns in a flashing design of horseshoes,
and the G.G. and his lady went early to
Randwiek to" applaud the Pageant. But the
Winter meeting was a sorry fellow —an
overcoated, goloshed, just-recovering-from-’flu
looking individual —and found nothing of
cheer at all in the drab day. Lady Stonehaven
wore her bottle-green top-coat with its deep
boundaries of fitch. Touches of gold in the
black hat that topped this were cheering; but
the warmest, bit of color in the vice-regal
group was in the cherry-red hat of Mrs.
Widgeon Wackett, who with her flying lord
was penned with the mighty. Furs were on
every back, and dear little bunny winked as
it masqueraded under a hundred aliases.
Not that every woman was a lamb in rabbit
skin. Many were sirens in seal, secure in
musquash, and righteous in mole. The smart-
est young things snuggled in topcoats of
tweeds, repps and check velours. One of this
last, in yellows and browns, enfolded Mrs.
Dennis Allen, while Burgundy repp with
sleek touches of musquash supported Mrs.
John McKelvey. Furs that were positively
languorous tempered the wind to Mrs. Jimmie
Burns; and a perfectly shaded ensemble in
which black and green and silver played
a part was worn by the vivid Mrs. O. E.
Jcnner.
At the Vice-Regal party last week the
ballroom at State Government House was
turned into a concert hall, and she who had
taken off garments with a lavish hand un-
derwent freezing by slow process, although
at her back in the drawing-room cheery fires
leaped half-way up the chimney. Compared
with her torments,, those of the gentleman
who was chained to a rock wfltile an inquisi-
tive bird scattered his most intimate works
to the winds of heaven were as nothing—Tie
didn’t have to look as though he was enjoy-
ing it. Encores, too, seemed to be the order
of the Governor-General. He and Lady
Stonehaven came on late from King’s Birth-
day dinners and Red Cross pageants, and at
one moment it looked as though he was
going to command the whole of the first half
of the programme to be repeated. The
warblers on the bill were Anita Roma and
Alfred Cunningham. Anita scored a double
encore with “The Star,” and Alfred’s most
fetching work was in Massenet’s “Elegie,”
though the Pagliacci Prologue ran a close
second. The pianist was Mrs. Walter Swan-
son, whose hands dripped magic, while three
youngsters poured out rich sweetness
through violin, piano and ’cello.
A train like a green and silver fish flapped
in the wake of Lady Stonehaven’s leaf-green
silk, and diamonds in her hair sparkled
messages to those about her throat and to
the crystal on her frock. Whene’er she
moved Her State Ex. stirred the air with
the filmy georgette addenda to the shoulders
ot her fuchsia and gold brocades, and over
these a last-minute dusting of diamonds and
pearls added to the glow. The son and
daughter of the house were also in the fore-
ground of the reception, Elaine’s cheeks
emerging dewy from rose pink. Of course,
this being a party in honor of George Rex,
law and order were largely represented. Came
Chief Justice Street, the Justice Owens.
Judge Tom Rolin and his wife (she a credit
to the bench in soft pink draperies), and
I olice-Commissioner Mitchell. Came Billy
Hughes’s Dame Mary wrapped to the ears
in pink plush. Came Dean Talbot and his
small wife, she very glittersome in heavily-
crystallised jade georgettes; and Mrs. Din.
Garvan in lacquer reds intensified by a
gold-tissue toil dressing. Persian reds and
golds were combined in Morua MacCormick’s
jumper frock. Sunbeam Mylius and her
mother sat with the Bertram Mackennals;
Brigadier-General Lloyd came with his
graceful lady; Mrs. A. J. Brady sparkled in
the midst of gold and black: Mrs. Alan Pot-
ter in heavy white marocains outlined in
crystal was a credit to uncle Tlieo. Marks.
Dagmar Thomson and Renee Maxwell bent
two fair musical heads together over the
programme, and official secretary Harry
Budge walked with the mild outward ex-
terior of the lamb, but his interior decora-
tion a tiger rampant against the Conserva-
tism of the anaemic days that are !
For a day and two nights each year the
Junior Red Crossers make merry in the
Town Hall. These foregatherings are, as it
were, the harvest home following on a year
filled _ witli good works, with sewing and
spinning, knitting and baking in the cause
of the Anzac’s orphan and the children of
soldiers who are still finding the adequate
.lob an elusive creature. Last week brought
round the festino again, and an army of
these small soldiers of the Scarlet Cross,
white frocked and serene, invaded the civic
fastness. The G.-G., who was booked for
the opening pageant, took it much as a
diner does a water-ice, between the King’s
Birthday dinner at Admiralty House and
George \ ,’s birthday celebrations at State
Government headquarters. With him he
brought Lady Stonehaven, in a neat design
of diamonds and leaf-like greens. After the
small admiral, who had headed the glitter-
ing procession of fancy costumes, had pre-
sented him in the most approved quarter-
deck manner with an official scroll, the
G.-G. handed out prizes to the group of
graceful mauve-clad youngsters who had
been the wistaria in the ambitious but
rather wobbly Crown tableau; to the little
girl who was a plump old lady on one side
and her own self on the other and called the
illusion “Coming and Going”; to another
enterprising young thing who went as a
wedding-breakfast, cake and wine and all;
and to a long line of happy kiddies most
of whose clever and attractive costumes
were made of paper. Lady de Chair pre-
sided over the exhibition of the Young Red
Crossers that, on the following day, stocked
the Town Hall with wares which, if judged
by the kindliness stitched into them, should
be of greater value than the tapestries of
Royal Egypt.
As round as Giotto’s O, Toti dal Monte
ruffled into the party given to welcome her
by the Musical Association. Proceedings
were got through swiftly, so that the last
laggard light in Farmer’s Hall of Righteous-
ness was switched off by ten. Two things
helped to this desirable end—the musical
programme was shorter than usual, and
Toti refused to hold a reception between the
music and the supper. The speeches, too,
were cut down to the bone owing to the
plump little singer’s weariness, and Toti.
with her black flounces, her lace scarf and
a head-dress not unsuitable to an act of
“Don Pasquale,” made her exit in record
time. Only one artist lias escaped more
quickly, and that was the intrepid D’Alvarez.
But Toti’s baby eyes and dimples haven’t
yet attained the altitudes of boredom
achieved by a mere curl of the Spanish lady’s
eyelashes.
The wives of this State’s Labor leaders
had a chance to air their skunk necklets and
ermine stoles the other day when Premier
Lang’s lady entertained Mrs. Collier, wife
of the Premier of Westralia. The pretty
blue room of the Wentworth garnished the
midday chicken with special blooms for the
occasion, and a bouquet of pink and red
carnations was added to the spoils of the
guest of honor.
So many of the concert singers of past de-
cades are pouring out their sweetness on the
air that the flapper of to-day is getting quite
well acquainted with the artists who charmed
m other and
father in the
not - so - long-
ago. One of
the latest to
join in broad-
casting pi- o-
gram m e s is
Madge Helm-
rich (Mrs. G.
B. Pidding-
t o n), whose
rich contralto
was heard with
the old Royal
Comics when
George Lauri.
Florence
Young, Flora
Graup n e r,
Wallace
Brownlow and
Dorothy Vane
were starring
in “La Pou-
pee.” In the first Australian production of
“The Belle of New York,” Madge played
a part, and was understudy to Carrie Moore’s
Mimosa San in “The Geisha.” After that
oratorio and concert work claimed her. Now
she lives at Narrandera—her husband is in
the Lands Office there. She is a sister to
Dorothy, the Sydney singing-girl who has
done so well in London. The picture is from
May Moore’s.
Of course, Scott Fell, M.L.A., did the
thing well at the wedding of daughter Cath-
erine, the baby of the flock. The knot was
tied at St. Stephen’s, and the young man
who got himself tangled in it was Dr.
Bouverie Anderson Stuart, a son of the late
Professor. Up an aisle fussily adorned with
tulle favors and outlined by tall silver wands
dripping pink and mauve sweet peas, the
small bride drew her wraith-like train, whose
tulle was weighted to earth with a border
of rhinestones and blister pearls, and was a
sinuous undercurrent to the foam of Carriek-
macross lace that formed the bridal veil.
This veil w r as loaned by the bridegroom’s
mother, and had been worn by her and her
mother before her. The wedding garment
proper was of ivory satin. Its tight bodice
had a transparent yoke, and its full skirt
gained the illusion of ankle length by a
deep transparent hem of tulle, the same
being embroidered in seed pearls and rhine-
stones. There were two young matrons of
honor, bride’s sister Mrs. Etherington and
Mrs. Goyder, whose diamente-studded frocks
reminded one of dew-splashed La France
roses. The matrons sported flower muffs in
mauve and pink, and so did the three small
nieces of the bride, who walked as flower-
scatterers in the procession. It took seven
ushers to seat the guests, of whom there
were nearly 300. Corks were drawn at the
Wentworth, where there was much lavish
frocking. Hostess Linda Scott Fell was in
terra-cotta lace of the Chantilly family
topped by a coat of terra-cotta and sea-blue
velvets, and the ’groom’s mother wore black
Chantilly, through which flashed soft leaf-
green.
The fair-haired, slim, young Dr. Anderson’s
second name is Primrose, which he takes
from the Rosebery family. The connection
is on the mother’s side.
Tom Roberts, doyen of Australian paint-
ers, is back in Sydney, where once he strug-
gled and starved on the old-time thin rewards
of art. There is to be a show of his work
at the Hordern
Galleries next
week. Roberts,
though born in
England 70
years ago, was
only 13 when
he came to
Australia, and
its sunshine is
in his ‘blood :
he was in the
forefront of the
school of Aus-
tralian artists
who fought for
the right to
depict that
sunshine as it
really is. It
was only after
years of striv-
ing that he
was able to
get away to
England, where he struck success; coming-
back to Australia a few years ago, he found
victory completely won in the old hard
battle. In the Sydney Gallery “The Golden
Fleece” represents his best work; his “Open-
ing of the Federal Parliament,” with its
amazing detail, was presented to King
Edward.
A. B. Shand, K.C., left his fireside at
Bellevue Hill one night last week to escort
daughter Eileen to the altar of St. Stephen’s
and say a word to Langford Gibson, who
waited there. Ivory Chantilly and gold lame
formed the wedding garment. A train of
lace sparkling with rhinestones, a tulle veil
moored to the back of the head by a narrow
band of the same glittersome stones and a
cluster of pink roses bound with gold ribands
were other items memorised by intending
brides. Two maids, like elaborate figurines
in gold lustre, and a small flower-girl, herself
rather like a rose, fluttered after the bride’s
train, while Keith Aikman (Melb.) and E.
C. Iceton, in tailorings of unblemished
character and a becoming coat of tan, stood
by the ’groom. Afterwards the bride’s
mother hostessed at the Ambassadors in
expensive raiment carried out in delphinium
blue emblazoned in silver.
To a young blonde citizen of Sweden, with
the misleading name of England, soprano
Hilda Boyle gave her heart and her hand, to-
gether with all vocal rights—gramophone,
broadcasting and purely domestic. The
transfer took place at St. Mark’s, Darling-
Point, with Canon Lea as chief witness. The
wedding-dress added to a tight little silver
bodice a much-gathered kirtlc that was prac-
tically a floral invention, so thickly sewn
was it with roses and orange-blossom. Add
the usual train of georgette, veil of tulle,
cascade of orchids, and two maids in blue
georgettes of early-Victorian architecture,
their scuttle bonnets blue in hue and adorned
with forget-me-nots. And that, by the way,
is supposed to have been a favorite flower
of Sweden’s famous Gustavus Adolphus.
It looked like a bag of golfsticks, but
really it was a sheaf of arrows, and the
golden-headed youth placed it carelessly be-
side him while he ordered a cocktail in the
Winter Garden of the Australia. Suddenly a
silvery twang cut the air. Then another.
“Curious effect of the plucked string,” said
a musician. But Mavis Fisher was con-
scious of a puncture just about the spot
where early lessons in anatomy had toil her
hcr heart throbbed. Across the Winter
Garden of the Australia John Waldron felt
a similar puncture over his heart. The
golden-haired youth picked up his bag and
went out laughing. As he did so John Wal-
dron, now of New York, one time of Mel-
bourne, was being “pleased to meet” Mavis
t wn h 'wi!!! , Sydney - ln ,e ? s than a week these
tv\o, wiiu had never met before, were married,
Aorangl n ° W half ' way to tlle States on the
One of the week's happiest dances was the
H a n U tnT n tJ & Old Boys of the Chris-
*iaa Brother s at Waverley. The Went-
worth was packed with manly virtues and
feminine charm, and the blue and gold of the
scliooi flew proudly aloft. President John
Hickey and his lady sat at a table on which
cornflowers and poppies smiled in rather
conscious simplicity. At this board, too, sat
ambassadors irom most of the big public
schools and a bunch of the best-looking girls
in the room. A flight of silver birds paused
on outstretched wing against the sunset
hues of Mrs. Hickey’s georgettes, and a crop
ot golden shamrocks bloomed on the lilac
raiment of Mrs. Aplett.
The A. C. Godhards’ dance was one of the
few private parties of note in a week
crammed with cabarets, school reunions and
Masonic balls. The dance was at their tem-
porary home, St. Mervyn’s, Double Bay and
the billiard-room and the verandahs over-
looking the bay were dedicated to jazz. The
hostess, in sable georgettes riveted with dia-
mante, did her act in the old-fashioned way
of seeing that every guest had a good time.
The frivol was to the glory of Mrs. Robert
\\ ardlaw, of Tasmania, and Alice Nathan
of Wellington (M.L.). and the belles of the
evening were erect and silver-haired Mrs.
Bullock and Gretchen-plaited Sylvia Godhard.
The Stage makes steady progress towards
emancipation. Compton Coutts, late of
‘'Tons of Money,” has opened the Stage
Door Sandwiche Shoppe in King’s-cross. It
is got up like a stage-door, and the window
is dressed to resemble a draped stage in
old rose velvet. Within he and partner Ing
Richards present a cast including sandwiches
of every known variety, a ballet of savories,
with special turns. Free-list entirely sus-
pended.
Their State Exes, will go gay with the
Millions Club at the Ambassadors on June
23. The occasion is the annual dinner dance
of the Millioneers.
This year the Artists’ Ball will grace the
Casino at Bondi on June 25. Nine hundred
tickets, at £1 each, are on sale at Paling’s,
and Mrs. Pacific will sit up in her bed and
wonder what that noise at her front door
means.
Miss Brisbane chronicles a gay week:—
Eddie Cahill and George Brooke had a bitter-cold
night for their first concert in the Exhibition; yet
enthusiasm never flagged. Brooke has improved vastly
in his years abroad, and has attained a fine command
of his voice. Negro spirituals and songs in French,
Italian and German followed one another. Cahill
plucked delightful music from the piano. By special
request of someone in the audience who heard him
play it in Dublin he gave “The Minstrel Boy” with
variations, and Brisbane proved its Irish descent by
its excitement. The I,ieut.-Governor and Mrs. Theo-
dore were in the hall. The concert was followed by
more parties for the returned musicians. Fred
Derrick, whose engagement to Irene Brown was lately
announced, is managing the concerts.
At His Majesty’s “The Sport of Kings” has brought
hurrahs from the racing fraternity and gathered big
and cheerful houses. King’s Birthday night brought
along an audience in holiday humor, and things were
very gay.
The Brisbane Cup was run at Ascot on the holiday,
and the weather warmed up but little for the occa-
sion. The bougainvillea is now in bloom, and there
were some vivid-hued frocks to match it. Mrs. Sligo
wore peacock-blue with orange; Mrs. A. W. Jardine
was in green; Mrs. Willie Persse in amethyst, and
Mrs. Gilbert Wilson in a graceful frock of Oriental
velvet. Lieut.-Governor Bill Lennon was the guest
of the committee for lunch; and the Isaac Moore,
J. IT. S. Barnes and Henderson matrons and Pat
O’Shea gave tea parties on the committee’s verandah.
In the evening Lennon’s was all dressed up with
scarlet poinsettia and rose and sheaves of gladioli
for feasting and jazzing. The Bob Cowlishaws had a
dinner party; the Garrick Webstors (Scotland) had
the Canning-Downs Barnses, the A. D. Walshes, Mrs.
W. Kent, the Webster maiden and Garth Elwyn at
their table. John Reid hosted a party amid yellow
balloons and pink and red roses, and the ballroom
was filled with dancers. At the Bellevue the J. A.
Youngs of Sydney had a dinner party in a setting
of deep red roses.
The Fleet had a big party to finish up a hectic
week of dances and dinners. Commodore Hyde and
the officers of the Delhi and the Sydney invited a
large roll-up to Birt’s wharf, where the boats
were moored. Greenery and Japanese lanterns
made fairyland of the river, where a light
mist hung. The gangways connecting the ships
were decked in scarlet. Between the quarter-decks,
issuing from caverned green, fell a tiny waterfall.
Mahogany elephants and trophies won at sports in
different parts of the world by the crew decorated
the supper tables. Mrs. Mutton wore a black jetted
gown, Mrs. Hawthorne was in dervish-and-gold bro-
cade, Mrs. J. L. Woolcock was sheathed in green
and silver, Mrs. Glynn Connolly chose foxglove mari-
ette, and Cecily Cadell-Garrick wore eau-de nil.
Brisbane is to have its Spanish Club, to foster a
love of the language, literature and art of Spain.
Louis Pares is a mover in the matter. It begins
with a membership of 30.

Our new Governor, on reaching Port Phil-
lip on the 28th, will be transhipped to
a bay steamer, landed at St. Kilda and
taken along our most beautiful road to the
city. On the way, cocked-hatted mayors
will present addresses, and the swearing-in
will be done at State Parliament House.
Two days later his Ex. will, if present
arrangements are adhered to, open the last
session of the present State Parliament.
There was frightful mortality amongst
the moths at the Birthday meeting at Flem-
ington on Saturday, when all the pelts that
ever were came out in response to an icy
breeze and wandered round on pink legs that
showed the goose flesh through their hose.
Cold as a polar-weather forecast looked a
damsel who braved the blast in sarong cloth
from Java; and as far as the mere racing
was concerned most of the cake went to the
bookies.
As a mannequin parade “Leave it to
Jane” at the Royal is as up-to-date as Myer’s
winter windows, though Minnie Hooper, who
got the usual bouquets at the final roll-call,
aimed at jazz orchestration rather than har-
mony in the undressings of the chorus. Jane
Witherspoon—she is daughter to a one-time
well-known Aussie comedian—provided grace-
ful shoulders for a gown that began at the
top end in palest yellow and shortly after
ended at the hem in darkest red, waltzing
through all the spectrum in the short distance
between. Margery Hicklin, the new import-
ation, aired a nifty jumper-suit about the
grounds of Atwater College. Strella Wilson
and Minnie Everett, of the adjoining G. and
S. show, were taking a busman’s holiday in
a box.
Angela Baddeley’s successful curtain-fall
effort on Saturday night to make Brian
Aherne laugh—the first opportunity he has
had since the Barrie cycle started —resulted
in the biggest demonstration of approval
Boucicault’s engaging show at the King’s
has yet evoked. The curtain had to go up
and down 49 times before the master of the
revels would allow himself to be thrown to
the lions; then the little man was seen for
an instant, briskly bowing his thanks. But
there w r ere no flowers. The impression is
abroad that the severely artistic Dion regards
these offerings of the faithful as out of place.
Theodore Fink, twinkling like a downy
little owl behind his large round goggles,
opened the Royal Art Society’s show at the
Athenaeum. President Lister-Lister gave the
grand piano his support, and drank in the
few well-chosen words as if he believed them.
Vice-president Charles Bryant was also
there, trying to look as Pan-like as his por-
trait by Lawson Balfour, and succeeding
when the light was favorable. John Long-
staff added his elegant moustache to the
general effect, and landscapist Herbert was
also inspecting the mass invasion, which is
in the nature of a counter-offensive against
the one-man attacks of Melbourne artists
on the Sydney market, which have become
alarmingly frequent of late. Looking at the
painted sunshine were the W. M. Robbins
and iC. W. Marryat dames, well furred
against the cold; and Mrs. G. Swinburne, in
violet. Numbers of the best-fed were there
wondering why some of the works were
priced at as much per foot of canvas as a
frontage in Collins-street.
At the Queen’s Hall recently members
of the National Council of Women called in
two women barristers to expatiate upon
the legal aspects of child adoption in Vic-
toria, this being a question that is to be
debated in July in Brisbane, when delegates
from all States confer. The safeguarding
of the claims of the adoptive parent appears
to be a prospective aim of the council.
Mrs. Hain and Mrs. Rosanove explained the
law, the latter a Portia whose black velvet
frock just swept her silk-liosed knees, and
whose shingled hair framed an attractive
face. Both took the view that the natural
parents have paramount rights. Their
opinion was supported by another legal
light, Brennan, who likewise advised
the cqimcil to leave well enough alone in
Victoria and seek to help parents, by en-
dowments and other means, to keep their
own offspring rather than attempt to amend
the law in the direction of strengthening
the claims of foster-parents. Speakers for
the council, however, took the side of the
adopting parent. The position in other
States, in England, on the Continent and
in America was cited, and the merits of
these systems were discussed during a quite
interesting evening.
Comic opera, musical comedy and Barrie
were in competition with Percy Grainger,
whose first recital took place at the Audi-
torium on Saturday night. Nevertheless the
Melbourne pianist faced a big audience. But
cold weather and ever-present fear of ’flu
caused the dressing to be hidden beneath fur
coats and other wraps.
Singers who faced an auditorium that was
to them as black as night, and dancers mov-
ing their limbs with charming grace who
bowed to unseen partners, were on the stage
at the Ormond Hall one evening last week,
when S. W. Hedger, superintendent of the
Institute for the Blind, held one of his con-
certs. At first a feeling of awful trepidation
seizes the spectator when an unguided per-
former tramps resolutely on to the stage and
stops dead a few inches from the footlights;
and it needed the assurance of D. L. Palmer,
the director of the capable orchestra, to con-
vince one that some of the participants in
a pretty sixteenth-century ballet were really
sightless. But one soon gets used to it. Fred
Sutcliffe raised enthusiasm as well as sym-
pathy with “Take a Pair of Sparkling Eyes,”
sung in a fine tenor voice. George Finlay, at
the piano, was another interesting figure. He
is a pupil of the Institute who is qualifying
at the Conservatorium for his bachelordom.
The British Music Society continued its
crusade for English composers at the Assem-
bly Hall one night last week by starting off
with the Beethoven B Flat Quartette, played
by Alberto Zelman, Bertha Jorgensen,
Dorothy Roxburgh and Tasma Tiernan.
Having burnt that much incense to the clas-
sics, they turned, with the assistance of
Winnie Roberts and Gwen Prockter, to a
sextette by Frank Bridge, an earnest work
displaying traces of incoherence in the final
movement. A quartette by Arnold Bax was
better done than the others. Not more than
a sprinkling of music-lovers rallied to the
call, but those who did attend were genu-
inely appreciative.
When Arthur Jordan, the leonine-headed
English tenor, went after Eva into Paradise
in “Die Meistersinger” at the Auditorium, he
was accompanied by about 2000 men and
maidens of Alberto Zelman’s symphony or-
. chestra, so what he said to the lady when
he got there was lost in the general uproar.
One gathered, however, that his voice was
still a trifle husky. Observing that the
singer was nearer the microphone than the
accompanists, this Chatterer, who was
suffering from cold feet, went home and
listened in. She heard him perfectly and
got her feet warm at the same time. Wire-
less is a great blessing. Incidentally, the
symphonists revealed themselves as a rather
unequal lot in the Elgar variations, but
pulled better together in the Brahms “Spring
Symphony.”
A cable the other day announced that
Katharine Prichard's newest book, “A. Work-
ing Bullock,”
is shortly to
be published
in Lond o n.
One or two
privileged folk
who read the
work in manu-
script describe
it as a parti-
cularly vigor-
our story of
West ralian
timber - coun-
try life. The
authoress, who
in private life
is the wife of
Captain Hugo
Th rossell,
V.C., of Perth,
has several
s u ccessful
novels to her
credit, win-
ning with “The Pioneers,” the £lOOO offered
by Hodder Stoughton for the best Austra-
lian novel. This picture, by Ruth Hollick,
was taken when Mrs. Throssell vras on a
visit to Melbourne recently. She used to
be a Tasmanian ; her father was for many
years editor of the Launceston Examiner.
It was a wet night outside the Queen’s
Hall and a dry one inside when Ralph Ber-
nard Randell, a very solid young man, with
wide brows, wider shoulders and an even
wider outlook, talked mostly to men on a
subject that should be dear to every woman’s
heart, since it dealt with the relief of the
household purse. “Low-temperature vacuum
dehydration of fruits, vegetables, meats and
fish” was his thesis, and lie spoke under
the auspices of the Food Education Society.
By his system 10 tons of beans are reduced
to one, all the vitamines being preserved,
and cabbage is desiccated for transport to a
tenth of its size. When put in water these
things regain their former shape and beauty
—to the woman out back who feeds her
family on the squoggy things that come out
of tins and the shrivelled little buttons which
come out of raisin-packets this will sound
as wonderful as the mango trick. Mr. Ran-
dell is going to carry his faith into action
by putting up a plant at North Fitzroy.
In the go-slow Gothic environment of the
Assembly Hall last week, Alexander Sver-
jensky, the thinly-thatched young man who
played for Lydia Lipkovska a few years
back and who now has his tent pitched
in Sydney, drew tears and laughter out of
the Steinway. He has a beautiful touch
and a large soul. Music-lovers were mostly
across the road applauding Arthur Jordan,
but a fair audience said it liked the other’s
tone-pictures.
Those high-powered organisers, the Tallis
dame, Mrs. Norman Brookes and Mrs.
Robins, smiled over their furs at an ava-
lanche of linen stuffs which poured into the
big drawing-room at Scott’s one day last
week in response to an SOS from that all-
woman affair, the Queen Victoria Hospital.
Some 300 packages and £7O in cheques were
the total loot. A big party ate the scones
to excellent music provided by the Bartolini
voice and the Gertrude llealy violin—so
excellent that it even produced silence
amongst the audience occasionally.
Henry C. Hart, general secretary of the
State Teachers’ Union, studies you here
through Spen-
cer Shiers’s
camera.
Known as
“Fighting
Harry” in his
younger days,
lie has put
force into his
union, taking
it over with
800 members
and raising it,
with the assist-
an c e of a
splendid body
of voluntary
workers, to
well over 4000
—about 75 per
cent, of the
service. H e
has just re-
turned from
his first holi-
day for three years, for he refused to leave
his job until the Teachers’ and Superannua-
tion Bills were placed on the statute book.
His pet scheme for one comprehensive union,
including elementary, high and technical
teachers, has also just been consummated.
In his leisure he edits the Teachers’ Jour-
nal, a paper with snap—the first Victorian
State School periodical that wasn’t born
stodgy and foredoomed to failure. A brainy,
forceful diplomat, with vigor and vision, the
teachers. of the State are lucky to have him
as a champion.
Mrs. Harry Naylor, one time of Mel-
bourne, whose husband helps to keep Aus-
tralia in touch with the outside world
through the cables at Darwin, sends to this
Page a report of her doings in that maligned
spot. A flourishing garden with pawpaws
in it, a poultry-farm started —“the eggs
came from the church, so they should be
good”—three sets of tennis and a swim be-
fore breakfast and dancing till three in the
morning figure in the programme. Inciden-
tally, a small son, left behind in Sydney be-
cause of the hypothetical terrors of the
climate, lost his appetite and has been sent
for in the hope that Darwin will restore
it. Mrs. Naylor forgot to mention the
Weather, by the way. It doesn’t seem to be
a favorite topic up there, as it is in Mel-
bourne.
Tom Roberts, looking—but not talking—-
more like the Knight of the Rueful Coun-
tenance than ever, has come down from his
Dandenong mountains to see numerous child-
ren of his genius off to Sydney, where he will
open a show at Horderns’ on June 14. Tom
Roberts is a bit of old Australian Art
history as well as a vigorous present wielder
of the brush. It is 38 years since he, Stree-
ton and the great Conder met in Melbourne
and formed a coterie. They exhibited in
the “9 x 5 Impression Exhibition” of 1889,
and the bearings of art critics ran hot at
the outrage.
Box plans open at Allans on June 15 for
“The Dalmatian,” Mona Mcßurney’s opera,
which is expected to elicit substantial aid for
the Queen Vic. Hospital. The composer,
the first woman to gain a musical degree in
this country, is probably the most versatile
composer of her sex in these parts. Her
pianoforte concerto “The Northern Ballad”
was first heard at the Women’s Work Exhibi-
tion, when Miss Mcßurney conducted it, with
Una Bourne as soloist and an orchestra
entirely of the fair sex.
Among the Aorangi’s passengers was tall
A. J. Winnington-Ingram, nephew of the
Bishop of London, who has just completed
five years’ work as principal of St. Aidaai’s
Theological College, at Ballarat. H’e carried
away a record of 100 per cent, passes for
Th.L. and a wristlet-watch from his students.
Audrey Dickenson has announced her en-
gagement from London. The man is Thomas
George Rutherford, of the Indian Civil
Service.
The marriage of Nancy Wallace Best,
daughter of the E. L. Bests of Kew, to
Lieut. Julian Wheeler, of the U.S. warship
Nevada, didn’t take place, as anticipated, at
San Francisco, where Mrs. Best disem-
barked with her little daughter. The U.S.A.,
having got its full quota of Australians for
the moment, ungallantly shooed them off.
The party therefore sped northward to Van-
couver, secured the services of a Presby-
terian minister, and held the ceremony in
a hotel sitting-room. The new bride, who is
a niece of knight Robert, met her sailor
husband during the visit of the American
Fleet, and their engagement was announced
on the eve of its departure.
A clever Melbourne girl has carried off a
prize offered by the Architectural Associa-
tion School in London. She is Doris Alde-
ney Lewis, and she intends to spend some
time in studying America’s array of labor-
saving devices, with a view to practical em-
ployment of them when she launches out on
a career of house-planning.
McPherson Robertson, the millionaire
confectionery man, who started in Fitzroy
with a nailcan as furnace, went off on the
Aorangi for a holiday trip to America and
England. This is the first real holiday he
has ever taken. Once, years ago, he went
abroad and worked in several leading lolly
factories as a journeyman, but that was to
pick up wrinkles.
Hawthorn will miss Mrs. M. E. Welshman,
who has died of pneumonia. She was a daugh-
ter of J. MqC. Kerr, of Auburn, who made
a fortune out of South African diamond-
fields and left it to his family a few years
ago. For more than 20 years she was one
of the most active members of Hawthorn
Benevolent Society. She had time for people
who were up against it even when she had
only just enough money to keep herself com-
fortably, and philanthropy was no mere
pastime of her prosperous days.
- Gwendolen Griffiths, the young daughter of
The Bulletin’s “Copabella,” after a bright
record at girls’ colleges which won her the
Senior Public at 16, is joining dad on the
Bundaberg News and Mail (Q.) as social
writer and deputy-assistant-substitute sub.
The small miss already drives a breezy pen.
Dr. Minnie Varley has decided against a
quick return to Melbourne. After being deco-
rated at the Edinburgh University, she re-
turned to London, and is staying there with
relatives. She is contemplating a profes-
sional career in Nigeria, where there is said
to be plenty of scope.
An Apple Isle item:—
Mrs. E. J. Rogers, Hobart’s new Mayoress (\ye
haven’t reached the Lord and Lady stage), gave her
first official reception by way of a welcome to
Muriel Starr, who is on her first visit to the Apple
Isle. The Town Hall was flower-bedecked and the
local lights of Art in its various forms came and
made their best bows.
Some Holy City echoes: —
Nineteen debutantes made their bow to Archbishop
Spence at the R.C. ball in the Town Hall, danced
in a setting of palms and rose-colored lights, and
supped off tables golden with Iceland poppies.
The Lunns of London, who mix evangelism and
the tourist trade, were morning-tea-ed at the Town
Hall by the Mayor and Mrs. Bruce, with earnest-
mi nded citizens to meet them and a speech or two that
included one from J. H. Vaughan on behalf of the
League of Nations. And there has been tea at
the Lyceum Club too, with Miss Behrens, the Girl
Guider, as the guest.
The String Quartette —Schlisky, Sylvia Whitington,
Kathleen Meegan and Harold Parsons—contributed
the bulk of the programme at the Con.’s last concert,
with Vaughan Williams and Brahms as chosen com-
posers and William Silver at the piano for the F
Minor quartet. The singer of the evening was Mrs.
Hedley Palmer, in excellent voice. There is much
rejoicing, by the way, over reports that come from
Harold Foale, one of the Con. students now studying
abroad. He has so impressed the Leipzig Conserva-
torium that that august body writes its thanks for
having been sent “so brilliant a pianist.”
The Moulden dame voiced the opening benediction
at the exhibition of paintings by Leila McNamara
in the Society of Arts rooms. N. S. Wales figures
largely in the canvases, some of the most pleasing
of which are studies of coast and sea. The Art
Gallery has bought “At Anchor.”
The Bridges—she in pleated navy-blue and a
fawn hat that picked up the tone of her furs—went
to Victoria Park for the opening of the Birthday
meeting, and ended the day with a Dal Monte con-
cert in the Town Hall. Early sunshine gave way
to drenching rain, and hid gay hats under a root
of umbrellas and concealed frocks (some of the
smartest of ’em coat frocks) under a uniform of
rain-coats. Earlier, the Governor had been at a pre-
liminary run of the hounds round about Brighton
to O’Halloran Hill—not following, but mounted, with
a pilot to show him the way, so that he saw more
of the run than the average road-follower.
Mrs. Gordon McFarlane and a students’ committee
"'ere prime movers in the dance for St Mark’s
College at the Glenelg Palais. Dressing was mostly
divided between slim and beaded georgette and out-
standing taffeta, two of the smartest of the latter
a silver-embroidered mauve and a powder-blue girdled
with silver.
The Lacrosse Association had its ball in the North
Terrace on the previous evening, with half-a-dozen
strong men to run it and cap and balloon stalls to
help the brisk ticket-sales.

Conspicuous among the
Wessex White Horses is the
one cut out of the Wiltshire
Downs at Alton Barnes.
It was made in 1812 a challenger
to the neighbouring White Horses
of Marlborough and Colne. You can
see it from Old Sarum, 20 miles away
as the crow flies.
The legend of White Horse as an
emblem of victory has travelled far

Horse first symbolised Whisky;
to-day the name stands as a guarantee
of Quality and Age, unsurpassed by
any Whisky obtainable.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Hinchinbrook (Mountain King—La Penna)
is about the most consistent nedcly racing on Sydney
courses just now. Second to Egerton in the Moore-
field Handicap, 10 furlongs, on May 29, this fine,
big black mare went one better in the £5OO Winter
Handicap, run over the same distance a week later
on the same Kogarah course. The hurdler, Cherry
Ripe, and the favorite, Kalloni, chased her home, and
as her closing price was 8 to 1, the stable —she is
trained by H. Foley for another Foley, P. .J. —must
have had a decent win. But while Hinchinbrook
proved honest, Don Moon and Onward, who had
run badly on the previous Saturday when well sup-
ported, bobbed up this time at long prices, and other
unthought-of outsiders made backers unhappy. An-
other source of annoyance was the out-of-date grand-
stand tote, which closes five minutes before a race
and, being slow in recording the volume of specula-
tion, keeps the punter puzzled until dividends are
announced. This club is well able to instal up-to-
the-minute machines, and the Government should
compel it to do so if the A.J.C. won’t.
There was a real inter-State flavor about
this year’s £2OOO A.J.C. Hurdle. Victoria pro-
vided The Governor, favorite, and Jollity, second
favorite; from Maoriland came Cherry Ripe, who
was next in demand ; South Australia sent over the
well-supported Sir Myram, and Darcy, the Westralian
jockey, rode Kenwood. They all fared badly, for
Sir Myram, The Governor and Cherry Ripe fell,
Kenwood was a long way out of it, and Jollity
whipped in the field; but none was as unfortunate
as the top weight, Palbi, who broke a leg at the
first fence and had to be destroyed. It is a fate
which has overtaken many fine horses who have
mixed hurdling with steepling. Cherry Ripe was
looking dangerous when he toppled over, but it is
improbable that he would have beaten Piratic (12
to l), who gave most of the field a long start over
the concluding mile and a quarter and had every-
thing settled at the last hurdle, winning as he liked
by eight lengths from Castles (33 to 1), who was
four lengths in front of Jupiter (7 to 1). A rugged
old bay by Piastre —Lady Skopas. Piratic is owned
by G. F. Nott, is trained at Canterbury Park by
O. H. Hall, and was ridden by J. Aldridge, a for-
mer pony jockey. It took him 4min. 33sec. to
traverse the two miles three furlongs, but the track
was heavy. With a 71b. penalty for Monday’s suc-
cess, his Grand National weight is now list. 51b.,
but there will be barrels of Sydney money for him
if he goes over.
Although Kalloni had a mere 7st. 51b., and had
run respectably in better company at Moorefield,
he was allowed to go out at 10 to 1 for the Novice
Handicap. He fairly romped home. Hinchinbrook
was at the same remarkable price for the Ellesmere
Handicap, and she also won, though not so easily.
Valdoona and Valamita made a good fight of it, and
Donald, who was favorite, might have beaten the
three but for interference. Critics formed a good
opinion of Kiosk (Tea Tray—Rosie Desmond), a
good-looking youngster from Maoriland, who was
made favorite for one of the Nursery Handicaps.
The flying Greenstead filly Aeneid (8 to 1) got a
break on the field, and Kiosk found 9st. 101 b., the
going and, perhaps, the want of a gallop too much
for him when trying to catch her, but he strug-
gled gallantly into second place. Minterne, who is
trained by Neil McKenna, the same as the unfor-
tunate Palbi, fell in the First Steeplechase, which
was won by Pericles (10 to 1) from Phoenix’s pair,
Prince Arim and Pay Day. The better of these
stable-companions—perhaps Pay Day, who knows
every ineli of the Randwick course and never runs
a bad race- may win big steeple.
The Brisbane iCup meeting broke all pre-
vious records in attendance, prize-money and tote
takings. The Cup prize (now £3OOO and a gold
cup worth £100) will probably be lilted to £5OOO
next year. Piastoon proved that his St. Eegei vic-
tory was no fluke by winning the Cup from end to
end. The Piastre colt carried w.f.a. (Bst. 41b.)
and was ridden a faultless race by Stumpy
Davis, who is having a wonderful run of success.
Wee Glen, who was favorite, cracked up after fight-
ing his rider most of the way, and the Sydneysider
Shrapnel—the best-backed horse on the course-
broke down. Fujisan, carrying lOst. 41b. and giv-
ing away 3st. Tib. to the bottom weight, made
hacks of the local sprinters in the New Handicap,
and the Seremond filly Budgerigah had no trouble
in defeating the other two-year-olds in the Sires
Produce Stakes (worth £1395 to the winner).
McShortodds loudly lamented his alleged heavy
losses, although he harl two skinners on Cup day
and the tote consistently laid longer odds. Fujisan,
2 to 1 on with the books, was 5 to 4 on in the tote,
with a second dividend thrown in. In winning his
third race at the meeting, the Royal Stakes, lujisan
established an Australian record for nine furlongs—
lmin. 49|sec.
Backers had a beastly time at the V.R.('.
Birthday meeting, particularly on Saturday, when
live outsiders scored. The only well-backed horse to
break the monotony was the ex-Sydneysider, Clan
Robert (9 to 2), who gave a fine exhibition of
fencing, with 12st. 3lb. up, in the Hopetoun Steeple.
He was immediately installed as favorite for the
Grand National, in which he has list. Blb., and
Mandelman, whom he beat after a spirited struggle,
was next in demand; but Mandelman came a crop-
per in Monday’s race over the big timber, which was
won in record time (2 A miles in smin. 2sec.) by
Blankwyn (7 to 2), and had to be put out of his
misery. The most encouraging G.N. Hurdle trial
was shown by Pildin. He had a rough passage and
was beaten into third place by Olbrook (7 to 1)
and Perchance, but shaped splendidly under his big
weight, list. 121 b.
* * * *
The Adelaide Racing iClub hail to post-
pone its Birthday Cup from Saturday till Monday,
and then the weather was gloomy and the track
sodden. But the crowd at Victoria Park witnessed
a great race. The judge could not separate hardy
Valbee, who ran third in the Australian Cup and
fell in the Sydney Cup, and the Adelaide gelding,
Paroodus, so the £lBOO hung up for first and second
was divided between E. L. Buxton, Valbee’s
owner, and Dean Rasheed. Valbee’s div. on the
£1 tote was £5 165., and Paroodus’s £6; Frances
Tressady, who was a close third, was better backed
than either. Bowalla, who used to be raced in Syd-
ney by Pat Nailon, returned a £23 2s. div. in the
W elter.

“Lud”: Jockeys are notoriously bad tip-
sters, so it is not surprising that Steve Donoghue
should have failed to pick the Epsom Derby winner.
A couple of days before the event Steve gave it
as his opinion that either Colorado or Swift and
Sure was the “pea.” Coronach* the ultimate win-
ner, though he started second favorite at 11 to 2,
had not impressed the critics. When he spoke
Steve was without a mount in the race. On the
day he was offered the job on an outsider, Lance-
gaye. That neddy, starting at 40 to 1, was second;
Colorado was third.
“Shrewsbury”: The annual appearance of the
“Derby dog” at Epsom had apparently some influ-
ence on this year’s result, since his backers allege
that Colorado was affected by the mong’s intrusion.
One wonders why the Epsom authorities don’t go to
the trouble of wire-netting the long straight, at
least, in an attempt to minimise this trouble. The
perennial hound has more than once seriously inter-
fered with the finish, and the open rails on the
“flat” side of the course offer no hindrance to his
wanderings. It would be quite possible for anyone
who has laid a favorite heavily to introduce a sur-
reptitious tyke to the course when the prad was
looking good on the run home.
BILLY GRIME. featherweight and light-
weight champion.
“Ibn el Issar”: One of the mysteries of the Cal-
cutta Sweep on the Epsom Derby is the manner
of securing the vast quantity of tickets sold nowa-
days. The rule has always been that the tickets
can only be obtained through a bona fide member
of the Calcutta Turf Club. Thirty years ago or
so outsiders obtained them through Indian acquaint-
ances, for the' most part Indian officials or army
officers serving in India. The prizes were moderate
in those days, but if ever}' member of the club
worked 24 hours a day now he could not keep pace
with the demand for tickets. The three cash prizes
this year totalled £210,000. Tickets are 15 rupees
each, so the number of subscribers may be esti-
mated. During the war the rule as to members was
relaxed, and the writer has bought tickets through
the secretary of the Cairo Turf Club, who did a
busy trade in his official capacity. It was reim-
posed later, but the rush is stronger than ever.
* * * *
“Modestine”: Tatt.’s will have to pull up
their socks if their Maoriland profits are not to
become tilings of the past. The MX. Government
is giving permits for more and more “art unions.”
One recently drawn brought in £40,000, and another
is offering £4OOO for two bob. The folder accom-
panying the usual 20 bobs’ worth of tickets in
this undertaking is a work of art. It contains par-
ticulars of the clubs—rowing, golf and tennis —-
which will benefit by the gamble, and goes on to
tell how the British Museum was founded as the
result of a lottery, mentioning incidentally the case
of the curate who, at the request of his sporting
parishioners, offered up prayers for Eliza Gray, under
the impression that Eliza was a soul in need of
succor, not a horse on which the parish had staked
its shirt. Follows an account of a lottery drawn
on the steps of St. Paul’s Cathedral on Jan. 11,
1569, and, in conclusion, you are asked to buy a
ticket because, “even if you do not win, you will
be helping the youth of the future to keep up the
physical standard which is the Dominion’s proud
boast.”
Class told at the Sydney Stadium on
Saturday night when Havilah Uren (9st. 7jib.) met
Billy Grime (9st. lib.) for the lightweight cham-
pionship. They can all beat Grime—from the ring-
side chairs, but inside the ropes it is a different
thing. Though Uren was always dangerous with his
tremendous left drives, Billy boxed superbly, hit
hard and was never there when Havilah reached
for him. The argument went the full distance, and
the dual champion got the only possible decision.
Time was when neither man could get a fight at
Rusheutters Bay, but they drew a gate of £1562.
Albert Johnson, brother of Len of that
ilk, made his bow at the Melbourne Stadium
opposed to Wonthaggi Gordon Eiely. Albert lacks
much of Len’s boxing polish, but appears more will-
ing to mix things than that languid coon. Kiely
was much the better boxer, and at the end of 10
very willing rounds he had a long lead on points;
but the black kept shooting in right body punches
and, after being dropped for a few seconds in the
14th, the miner appeared to be cracking up. Some
of Johnsing’s blows, however, were dangerously close
to the line. One landed too low in the 16th and
Quirk promptly disqualified him. Johnson weighed
lOst. 61b., and Kiely a pound less.
“C. Coral”: The Papuan’s fondness for
football (B. 11/3/’26) is shared by the boys of
the neighboring islands in Torres Strait. Cricket
is also popular with these islanders, though they
prefer their own rules and consider it an improvement
for the batsman to have a menial to do the Tun-
ing when the ball is hit. Many boys have boxing-
gloves likewise. I found one of them deep in the
pugilistic column of an illustrated paper. “Ah,
I see that colored man, Wills, he beat that white
man, Firpo, in the fight,” he observed. “He make
big money, that Wills. You t’ink he fight white
man Dempsey here some time?” I said I thought
not.
* * * *
After finding three days all too short a
time for securing anything but a moral victory against
Middlesex —scores, Australia 489 (Andrews 164,
Collins 99) and 239 for 5 wickets (Woodfull 100) ;
Middlesex 349 (Stevens 149) —the tourists met a
North of England team at Birmingham and sustained
something of a check in their near-triumphal pro-
gress. At all events they never looked like winning
and there was a stage in the game when it was clear
that they might very easily lose. In the old days,
the loss of a match or two before the first Test was
not regarded as any particular calamity, but standards
have altered. The North of England side was about
as strong, on paper, as the South of a week before,
with five or six potential internationals. Up to
now the cognoscenti have been fairly unanimous that
if Collins and eo. should fail to come up to expecta-
tions, it would be because the bowling strength falls
short of that of Armstrong’s 1921 combination. There
may be more warrant for apprehension on that score
now that Macartney and Richardson, who were taken
as change bowlers, are proving more reliable than
any of the regulars, but on this occasion it was the
batting that crashed.
The Australians didn’t do badly to dismiss a side
containing some of Yorkshire’s and Lancashire’s
most reliable scorers for 239. Sutcliffe (35) retired
hurt —and his injury may keep him out of the first
Test; Holmes made 43 and Geary 39. But when
Australia could scratch up no more than 105 in
reply, with Taylor’s 22 for top score, no wonder the
English press broke into exultant headlines. Much
has been written about Root, a right-hand medium-
paced bowler with an “in-swing” or “in-swerve,” but
it all fails to explain how he dismissed Bardsley,
Woodfull, Taylor, Andrews, Ryder, Gregory and Pons-
ford for a beggarly 42 runs. A man who plugs along
week after week for a very feeble county—Worcester-
shire only won a single match last year —and almost
has to carry the burden of dismissing opposing sides
on his own back, can’t spring many surprises,
even on batsmen who have never faced him
before. It was his day out, anyhow, and
Australia were pretty lucky to save the follow-on.
The North scored 77 for one wicket in their second
essay and declared at tea-time on the third day,
leaving the visitors two hours for play and over
200 behind. Three wickets fell quickly, two of them
to Larwood, the Notts, fast bowler, who may yet
deprive Allen of a place in the first Test, but
Andrews (67) and Macartney (20) saved the situ-
ation by keeping their stumps intact till the call
of time.
Saturday morning saw Bradford the venue and
Yorkshire —minus Sutcliffe, Holmes, Macaulay and
Kilner, all chosen for the English trial game, though
the first was a casualty—taking the field. The
batting side opened none too well, and after Wood-
full had been run out for a patient 24 and Collins
taken at the wickets for a cautious 20, six wickets
were down for 75. Gregory (24) and Richardson
(37 n. 0.) improved things a bit, and Ellis (20)
helped in a plucky last-wicket stand that brought
the total up to 177. Crawford and Waddington
worked most of the havoc, fast bowlers both: the
latter will be remembered as one of the failures
of Douglas’s 1920-21 team in Australia.
With 105 on the board at the fall of the second
wicket, Yorkshire seemed to be establishing a grip
on the game, but it soon slackened and vanished,
for the last eight men could add only 50. Mitchell
(46) and Oldroyd (39) were top scorers. Grimmett
took six wickets for 87, and Richardson three for 31 ;
perhaps Ellis, who stumped two men and caught
three, may be held to have had more to do with
the dismissal of the side than either. The Australians
lost Woodfull early in their second venture, but when
stumps were drawn on Monday night they had
already equalled their first innings total. Andrews
(73), Bardsley (39) and Collins (48 n. 0.) had saved
the situation, giving their side a lead of 200 with
seven wickets to fall and Tuesday left for play. A
two-days’ match against Durham County, unlikely
to involve much strain, precedes the opening of the
first Test at Nottingham on Saturday.
“Lansdowne”: Frederick Robert Spofforth, most
famous of all Australia’s cricketers in the days when
Australia was first showing that it could meet and
beat the pick of England, died on the day the six-
teenth Australian XI was up against its toughest
proposition, so far, at Birmingham. He would have
been 73 next September, which reminds me that it is
48 years since I saw him first, on the Clifton College
ground in 1878, 6ft. or more of hawk-like possibili-
ties in a rather gaudy blazer. It is the fashion now
to represent Spoffortli’s phenomenal success as due to
his variations of pace and his headwork ''generally.
No doubt it all helped., but it was the way lip
“rocked them in” that first secured him his sobriquet
of “The Demon,” an asset of which it would be
hard to over-estimate the value. Spofforth’s best
year was probably 1884, when he took 216 wickets
at a cost of a bit over 12 runs apiece; if a few
bowlers could do that nowadays, three full days’
cricket would finish most matches. His best per-
formance was put up 44 years ago in the historic
second of all Tests at the Oval, when he took 14
wickets in the two innings for 90.

The largest football crowd in Melbourne
on Saturday—3o,ooo odd —conveyed itself to where
the hardest fight was anticipated, the collision of
Essendon with Carlton. The game was fast and
skilful, but from half-time onwards the ’Dons had
little say, and the scorer’s final remark was: Carlton,
73; ’Don, 51. At Richmond, the Geelong 18, sub-
dued by its previous week’s defeat, encountered the
Tigers before an audi-
ence of 23,000 and
had to go its hardest
to collect the spoils:
Geelong, 83; Rich-
mond, 73. Fitzroy
likewise found North
Melbourne a tougher
proposition than it had
expected; ’Rov, 81 ;
North, 77. The Col-
lingwood Magpies made
an exciting game with
South Melbourne up to
half-time, but there-
after did much as
they listed: 88 to 50.
St. Kilda overcame
Hawthorn by a similar
margin—79 to 50 ;
and Melbourne ground
Footscray into its Own
odoriferous soil with a
tally of 105 to ’Sclav’s
46;

The Rugby League game between Is. S.
Wales and Queensland drew nearly 50,000 people to
the Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday, and the
great "majority left rejoicing in a N. S. Wales win
as complete as it was unexpected. The Blues put up
30 points to 17, of which 19 went on in the first
half. Queensland’s forwards w r ere completely over-
run by the lighter and faster opposition, while then
failure to get the ball out kept their attack tied up.
There was little in it as far as tries were con-
cerned, N. S. Wales crossing 6 times as against 5
by Queensland, but Toohey’s 0 goals as against
one by Aynsley made all the difference. The young
N. S. Wales side justified itself, back and forward.
Hardy, at full-back, made the veteran Craig a novice
by comparison. Indeed, on the day, every man in
the N. S. Wales XIII showed a remarkably high
standard of play. Gorman, at centre, and Aynsley,
on the wing, were the outstanding Queensland backs,
Caples being ineffectual and the half-back line
below expectations.
The return match on Monday saw N. S. Wales
win again by a try and a penalty goal to a try—
five points to three. There was another huge crowd,
despite the cold and wet conditions, while the game,
considering the slippery footing and the greasy ball,
was bright and interesting. The N. S. Wales for-
wards again did good service by getting possession,
and stood up manfully to their weightier opponents,
while showing more pace in the open. On one or
two occasions Queensland showed some meteoric
passing, but it led to little good. The side is too
much wedded to machine tactics. Although attacked
almost continuously in the second half, the visitors
led by three points to two until a couple of minutes
before full time; then, from a scrum following on
a fine attempt to cross the line by Wearing, who was
grandly tackled by Paten, Lane scrambled across and
N. S. Wales had won the rubber.

“Bulimba”: Queensland Football League
(Australian rules) dealt drastically with a junior
player accused of disorderly conduct on the field.
The offender, a lad of 14 or 15, was alleged to have
indulged in rough play and profane language. When
cautioned, he committed the unpardonable sin: he
cheeked the- umpire. That horrified official reported
him to the league, which disqualified the boy for
life. A deputation of his clubmates pleaded
for his reinstatement, and was supported by several
delegates, one of whom pointed out that the boy
had already stood down for two Saturdays. The pre-
sident mildly protested that the reduction of a life
sentence to two weeks was rather a sweeping commu-
tation, but the advocates of mercy carried the day.
The youngster was called before the council, and
after a stern rebuke, was dismissed with the admoni-
tion, “Go and sin no more.” The scene recalled
the picture of a gigantic scoutmaster addressing a
tiny boy scout: “Wolf-cub Hawkins, you have been
found asleep on your post, the penalty for which is
death. For a second offence you will be fined tup-
pence.”
SPORTING TEMPERAMENT?
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A sensation was caused in the Surrey golf cham-
pionship. Kingsley was playing Crolerees and both
were using rubbers. Foothold was difficult and
Kingsley changed to spikes. This annoyed Crolerees,
who began to play a ragged game and finally re-
tired in dudgeon.”
I’ve heard it of dramatic stars
That, if a rival’s costume jars,
They’ll sulk, in boudoirs or in bars,
And vowed if e’er my lot it
Should sadly be through life to nurse
A temperament like theirs, or worse,
I’d seize it with a savage curse
And cheerfully garrotte it.
Such petulance, I reasoned, came
From effervescent Thespian fame,
It hardly seemed a manly game
Could ever have begot it,
I wonder if an old-style pug
Would view askance Carpentier’s lug,
Or, puzzled by a new-style- mug,
Might fail, perchance, to dot it;
Or if a Lindrum, loath to lose,
Might yet, because opponents use
A non-skid butt upon their cues,
See red the white and pot it;
Or, should a bowler with a kink
Just change his socks to salmon-pink,
If Gregory from the ball would shrink
And e’en forbear to swat it.
For mark, I pray, the fuss they made
When Crolerees and Kingsley played
At golf in some old Surrey glade—
From memory ne’er I’ll blot it—
For on their long cross country hike
’Twas wet, as if some flood-pressed dike
Had burst; and Kingsley used the spike,
But Crolerees —ho got it!

THE INKY WAY.
“Hayeworray”: Died, aged 58, at Cobram
Francis Herbert Ross, a native of
Windsor (Vic.), who began his Inky Way
career on the Prahran Telegraph. After
some activities at Nhill and Finley, with his
brother Arthur (who pre-deceased him four
years ago), he oecame part-proprietor of
the Courier at Cobram, and remained there
for the past 32 years. Besides being a prac-
tised writer he had been a keen footballer
and cricketer in his younger days, and was
an ardent Big Trickle fisherman to the last.
Irvine Perel, editor of Brisbane Patriot,
has gone off with a pal for a ramble through
China. Perel has been running the Patriot
for 33 years, and he reckoned he had earned
a rest. Lately he has been writing remini-
scences of his stormy middle years, when
he was associated w'ith “Bread or Blood - ’
Vosper, John Norton and other firebrands.
In recent years he has been a trenchant critic
of the grab-all type of Labor misleader. He
worked hard against them at the recent elec-
tions, and when the numbers went up he
announced “I’m off to China.” It might
just as well have been Timbuctoo or Spitz-
bergen, but he said China, and he stuck to it.
“II.Iv.”: Sydney Sun will next month
be a 16-year-old, having made its first
appearance under its present name on July 1,
11)10. Previously issued as the Australian
Star, it began anew with a circulation of only
15,000, which was nearly doubled within a
week. Nowadays, the net sales are 185,000.
Incidentally, the circulation of the Sunday
Sun, born later, has advanced from 42,000 to
254,000. Of Australian papers only the
Woman’s Mirror can show more dazzling
figures : it tried the market with a first issue
of 25,000, and had passed the 100,000-mark
by the end of its first year. Now, six months
later, it has got beyond 112,000.
“Avon” : “War stuff” is no good any more
—nobody is interested. Subs, and chiefs, not
to speak of writers and publishers, have been
quarrelling over the point for two years or
more. Well, easily the most carefully-
examined exhibit at the Dunedin (M.L.)
Exhibition, just closed, was a small relief
map of Gallipoli. It almost at once became
a rendezvous for ex-Diggers, and the sergeant-
major in charge of the section swears that
he had to listen to at least 50,000 accounts
of “What I did at Gallipoli”—occasionally
it was what Bill did. Anzac Cove and
Suvla Bay, which at the outset were a
bright yellow, were nearly jet-black at the
finish, and the names on the map were all
lingered out.
“Adelaide”: The action of Adelaide Reg-
ister and Advertiser over the doings of the
Australian cricketers raises a nice point in
ethics. Long ago they used to display on
boards every item of big cricket news,
whether at the local Oval or cabled. Then
it struck them that they were only spoiling
the sale of their own afternoon editions,
and, remarking that they were not free
news-distribution agencies, they gave up the
generous custom. Later, when the indepen-
dent afternoon News started, they both sold
out to it their afternoon-edition fights, and
remained morning papers only. Now they
get the finish of each day’s play in England
just too late to use it; and both display
it outside their offices as of old, which must
damage the sale of the News quite a lot.
“Mel”: My par. about “standardised
poems” did not refer, as Guy Innes assumes
(B. 27/5/’26), to my old friend James
Purtell, the last of the popular balladists,
but to another Melbourne celebrity, “Michael
McThirst.” Michael made the mistake of
printing his early verses in book form, and
these sins of his youth rise up to confound
him when he adapts them to later occasions.
It’s a hard world for poets when editors
have such long memories. Purtell is still
publishing his acrostics in editions de luxe.
It is a grievance with him that he has been
denied that meagre Government recognition
granted to Henry Lawson and Roderic
Quinn, although, as he justly points out,
neither Henry nor Rod could have written
such a ballad as “Poor Tommy Corrigan.”
“Zorro”: The new edition of the anthology
of Maoriland verse has been poorly compiled.
Though the book contains some of the best
pieces of such well-known Bulletin men as
David McKee Wright, Bartlett Adamson,
Arthur Adams, Hubert Church and Will
Lawson, and such latter-day sprigs as Kath-
erine Mansfield, it also includes acres of
barren verbiage by Alfred Domett and Pem-
ber Reeves and such-like old gentlemen. J. C.
Beaglehole is probably M.L.’s sweetest singer
just now—among those, at any rate, who
remain at home—and he tells me that of
the things which lie sent in the editors chose
the worst; and in my own case they calmly
disregarded everything I gave them, and dug
one of my youthful indiscretions from an old
file. W. F. Alexander and A. E. Currie are
to blame.
“The Deacon”: McMurrough Kavanagh,
founder of the Irish Australian, the fore-
runner of the Sydney Catholic Press, the
R.C. official organ in N. S. Wales, died
lately. Although the Freeman’s was firmly
established long before the late ’nineties, a
section of the R.C. clergy was dissatisfied
and decided to form another paper more
suited to its tastes. The three prime movers
were Fathers Francis Timoney (who had
been a college professor and inspector of
schools), Joseph Bunbury and Patrick
McGlone, all freelance journalists. These
three did the necessary spade-work (Bun-
bury pushed an old bike all one summer
soliciting advts. and subscriptions south and
west and back again). The brilliance of
their articles soon put the Press on the
map, and the outbreak of the Boer War in
189!). with the appointment of Timoney as
chaplain to the forces and his weekly sting-
ing letters from the Front —the policy was
dead pro-Boer—set the seal on its success.
Timoney, who bitterly disliked Kitchener,
wrote stuff that even Tighe Ryan had to
blue pencil; but he promised to publish
it all at the end of the war. The
opportunity never came for him .or either
of his two confreres. Timoney died under
an operation for throat trouble in a London
surgery, Bunbury died in Sydney from an
accidental overdose of sleeping mixture, and
McGlone was killed in Lithgow (N.S.W.)
from the back of a bolting horse, all within
a couple of months.

WILLY
tx
Not merely a new model but a new development
in Motor Engineering.
20.7 h.p. Rating—but develops 54 h.p.
WITH the launching of the WILLYS-
KNIGHT “70” Six the Willys
Overland Company has achieved an
objective that many makers have been striving for.
Built and designed to give greater acceleration,
the WILLYS-KNIGHT “70” Six will out-perform
all other stock cars of comparable size.

in America. (Torque is the smoothest drive with
least loss of power en route.)
With a 2-15/16-inch bore and a 4f-inch stroke,
the power-plant of this car delivers greater power
per cubic inch of piston displacement throughout
its entire range than any stock American motor
car engine built to-day !
Tested against 26 other selected American makes,
the “New” WILLYS-KNIGHT gave performance
that was absolutely phenomenal.
Its engine develops horse-power 170 °/o greater
than its rated power.
Its accelerative powers are astounding.
Its Braking System amazing.
Its design, finish and general riding comfort
absolutely perfect.
It represents a replica of the Famous WILLYS-
KNIGHT Great six, but in a £2OO lower price
class.
The WILLYS-KNIGHT “70” Six has been
welcomed as the acme of Engineering perfection
in America —never before has any new motor car
so stirred the motoring public of America —and
it will soon be openly acclaimed as the “Wonder
Car of the Year” in this country.
Here is the car which is placed before you after
completely capturing the world’s best judges of
motor cars.
Here is an absolute Engineering and Structural
triumph.
It is the direct result of one of the world’s largest
motor car manufacturers to give the public a
super-performer at a reasonable price.
Your interest—your enthusiasm will be keenly
aroused with one inspection and demonstration.
Some oi the Many Features of Willys-Knight “70-Six”
Seven Bearing Crankshaft; Air Cleaner; Four-Wheel Brakes; Horn and Headlight control on an
extension arm controlled from the Steering Wheel; a torque that in tests surpassed the torque of

A very wistful-looking painter who re-
painted his own portrait of his native land
in wistful colors was Percy Grainger at
Melbourne Auditorium on Saturday; but his
interpretation of this large, lone land’s pecu-
liar psyche in his “Colonial Song” was the
one melancholy note in the evening’s har-
mony. The remainder of the expatriated
Australian’s repertoire gave full exercise for
his strong and vigorous technique and a style
and execution which recall the daemonic
strokes of Mark Hambourg rather than the
dreamy reflections of Moiseiwitsch. But a
quality which neither of these previous ex-
ponents had in overflowing measure brims
the cup of Percy Grainger’s art. That qual-
ity is gaiety. It is not the gaiety of a phil-
osopher waltzing gravely to the rhythm of
deep inner thoughts, but the spontaneous
happiness of an unsophisticated kid. This
spirit guffawed through the jazz-parlor antics
of “Juba,” which is the composition of a
negro, and through which the flapping feet,
fat hips and shining visage of coal-black
Mammy can be clearly visioned; it clattered
with the yokel heels of the morris dancers
in “Country Gardens”; and in “Birds of
Dawn,” by Fannie Dillon, a rising American
composer, it took joy in the treetops and
the clamor of Californian birds. It is curious
a pianist so gay in temperament does not in-
clude in his pantheon the gayest of spirits,
old Ludwig, of Bonn, whose centenary comes
next year; in his more ambitious exposi-
tions the pianist turned to Bach’s Fantasia
and Fugue in G minor, the seldom-
considered Chopin Sonata in B minor, Liszt’s
third Liebestraum and an Oriental fantasy
of Balakireff, full ot exotic color.
Subtlety and delicacy, pounding vigor and
a left which would be an asset to a pugilist
are all lodged in the steely-looking hands of
Percy Grainger. A nice, frank, refreshingly
easy platform deportment go with them, and
Percy Grainger
accepts thanks from
his former fellow-
countrymen at
Melbourne
Auditorium.
the traditional coachman’s mop of musicianly
curls fails altogether to conceal the Aus-
tralian lineaments beneath it. A habit
between selections of gracefully chatting to
his audience, in a high, sympathetic voice,
about the Grainger ideals will lead to the
pianist-composer’s popularity. A world
commonwealth of music, in which the lambs
and lions of the various schools can lie down
together and in which the despised British
shall find the niche they are entitled to, is his
aim, and in his programmes he proposes to
quarter the known globe in quest of examples.
Debussy, Ravel and others of the moderns
graced another varied dish on Tuesday.
“Leave It to Jane,” at Melbourne Royal,
is a medium proposition. There are no sur-
prises. Mona Barlee is Jane, a “college
widow” who, at the end of each term, lays
a student-lover in the grave of forgotten
things, and turns up at the beginning of
the next to inquire after another. She has
grace and good looks, but is not more melo-
dious than an aviary of singing birds. The
plot moves around Jane, with occasional
excursions to the football-field. The foot-
ball, being the American game, is mercifully
played off-stage, like the torture business in
“La Tosca.” Billy Bolton and Leyland
Hodgson maintain a spirited contest for the
position of juvenile lead, and this Page is
unable to say who wins; but, Hodgson hav-
ing humor and Bolton being merely tall and
decorative in symphonic trousers and a Mar-
celle wave, it is probably the former. Mar-
gery Hicklin, as an athletic girl, has more
substance and less voice than Maud Fane,
who figured in the part last year in Sydney;
but she is bright and colorful. Cecil Ivelle-
way is cool and collected as a schoolmaster,
and Athol Tier is as long and languidly
fierce as ever, and confirms this Page in its
original opinion that his ribald legs are a
find. Hugh Steyne is inconspicuous, and
the ensembles are willing but a trifle inhar-
monious of color. “Leave It to Jane” may
safely be left to that gallant-hearted popu-
lace which never allows a lady to stand in
the ’bus if she is young and pretty.
** * *
Maggie Wylie, daughter of a simple but
prosperous Scots household, has no “cliarrum.”
(As Angela Baddeley is Maggie, this lack is a
mere dramatic fiction.) John Shand is a
poor but ambitious lad who educates himself
by getting information from the Wylie library
when the family is in bed. Caught at it, he
consents to marry Maggie in return for his
’Varsity fees. Invading England, he is
shortly in the running for a Ministerial job.
His speeches become the backbone of the
Government. John composes them while
Maggie knits stockings. But John, like most
politicians, has no humor. Maggie drops, not
stitches, but arresting phrases. Dull John
picks them up, mistaking them for his own.
Lady Sybil is a brilliant comet who flits
across liis path; he follows her and is headed
for the rocks. But John knows himself at
last for a dull-metalled fellow; he wakens to
the fact that Maggie’s intelligence has charms
more useful to him than the physical ad-
vantages of Lady Sybil.
This is, of course, “What Every Woman
Knows,” and what only the worst dolt of a
husband fails some day or other to discover.
The piece was revived, after 15 years’ desue-
tude, at Melbourne King’s on Saturday, and
revealed Barrie at his subtlest in devising
stratagems to wring the human tart. Angela
Baddeley attended strictly to business despite
an operation undergone during the week, and
an exterior made no more unattractive than
necessary hid Maggie’s heart of gold and
tongue of fire. Brian Aherne’s long and in-
articulate legs carried John Sliand rather
stiffly through the storm, but the gloomy
egoism of the fellow was safely lodged in
the small frowning headpiece and gawky
gestures of this capable mime. Mary Hinton
as the aristocratic decoy rose to the demands
of high emotion, but was still too unresilient
for moods of tenderer import. Mary Jerrold
was a charming French comtesse and the rest
of the symphony was in tune.
Chaliapin, the biggest bass noise in the
world of song, will commence to boom hi
Melbourne on July 10. He will give 25 Tait
concerts in Australia and Maori land. Being
a domestic animal of a particularly devoted
kind he will bring his wife and four chil-
dren with him; but, having presumably
heard what Mr. Clapp said about them, is
taking no chances with Australian kitchens.
A chef accompanies the expedition.
“Betty Lee” will relieve “Mercenary
Mary” of her duties at Melbourne Princess
on Saturday. The creature with the pretty
name is our old friend “New York’s smartest
and brightest musical comedy” and is set in
Southern California. “The Best People” con-
tinue to receive lots of callers at the Ath-
enaeum. “The Mikado” hasn’t yet announced
the date of his deposition at His Majesty’s;
there is general contentment with his rule.
The atmosphere will be strained for the
next few weeks at Melbourne Palace, where
“Are You a Mason V” is suffering a revival.
Frank Neil’s method of production is mainly
bellow, although he himself has genuine
comedic talent. Field Fisher’s carp-like grin
assists matters, Maurice Tuohy has a beau-
teous appeal, and Mary Gannon, who says
little, but has a fetching figure and a dis-
tractingly gorgeous blonde shingle, recalls
the poet’s dictum that they also serve who
only stand and wait.
❖
Ella Shields is holding one of her posi-
tively farewell seasons at Melbourne Tivoli,
and the warmth of the welcome accorded
her is a happy augury for her next. Bluett
and “Mo” have deserted from the navy, and
this week are to be seen as fashion-plates;
and the Patricolas are acrobats who justify
the word “extraordinary.”

At Melbourne Bijou, Moon and Morris’s
new revue, “Red Hot,” is being thankfully
received. It is the best goods nut on the
market by this firm to date. The Mackin-
non boys are dancing ambassadors from Scot-
land with points about them. The rest is
average vaudeville.
Melbourne playgoers have the choice this
week of beholding “The Best People” in the
round at one address, and in the flat at an-
other. Hoyt’s shadow version isn’t elevating,
but “The Dixie Merchant” in support makes
up for it. At the Majestic, Marie Prevost, in
“Recompense,” is weaving a trail of scent
and roses across the late battlefieldsi of
Europe; and in “Eve’s Lover,” Irene Rich
and Bert Lytell are honeymooning in the
tropics.
IRVING’S IMPERIAL MIDGETS AND
CHEFALO, AT SYDNEY HIPPODROME.
Willy Rolle, the chief midget, conducting the
show, and Chefale, the magician, makes
an amusing magical mistake.
Sodom and Gomorrah in Melbourne: —
Sydney being regarded in Melbourne as a replica
of the Cities of the Plain before their destruction,
people rolled up to the show of the Royal Art
Society of N. S. Wales at the Athenaum prepared
for the horrible, the naked and the unashamed in
paint. Instead, what they saw was the apotheosis
of the polite. The nearest approach to futurism
was Dattilo Rubbo’s portrait of himself, but the
approach was accidental; the only revolutionary
effort was Lister Lister’s “River Oaks,” but it was
only an internal revolution; and the only nude was
as decorous as G, L. Tindall and a convenient shadow
could make it. The portraits of Rubbo and A. S.
Watkins would never forget to take their hats off
when there are ladies in the lift. The rest of the
exhibit is as solidly respectable as a suite of Geor-
gian furniture, but there is faithful workmanship
in it. Amongst those who were worth the train
journey are Sid Long, whose brushwork is so deli-
ciously alive that his decorative subjects would look
just as joyous upside down; James R. Jackson; Law-
son Balfour, whose Spanish girl is a very satisfying
scribble in oil; Erik Langker, who has a viewpoint
of his own; and John Banks, who gets no further
and is hereby strongly suspected of exploiting a mere
device. IJt is probably not Charles Bryant’s fault
that H.M.A.S. Australia died in such an un-
spectacular manner, since the picture of the event
is intended to be historic. The Maorilander W. A.
Bowring does work that is conscientious but cold.
The Lister Lister aforementioned is full of vibrating
light and is worth all his big acreages, with a couple
of sheep-stations thrown in.

Another picture-show in Melbourne:—
Four water-colors claim a second look amongst the
34 examples of Carlyle Jackson’s art now showing
at the New Gallery. No. 34 begins in a poetic
foreground reminiscent of. Hilder and ends in a
very material bridge and a solid river decorated with
a somewhat self-conscious boat. No. 9, “Sunny After-
noon, “Walhalla,” is a complicated picture whose
various parts are eery tenderly suggested. No. 32, a
study of fine contrasts, vigorously conceived, depicts a
ragged old gum flanked by two of its own fledglings.
No. 15 shows very cleverly the sullen look between
smiles the Australian landscape sometimes assumes.
These four were painted by a young man with some-
thing to say who is learning to say it better.
Toti dal Monte, whose architecture is a
series of circles —round body, round eyes,
round mouth and round notes—-melted the
hearts of Sydney on Saturday with the song
of the lovesick Rosina. With the fluency
of running water, a piercing sweetness and
an absolute accuracy of pitch, the runs and
trills of “Una Voce” were compassed, and
the final sustained notes of great altitude
reduced the audience to a grovelling mass.
Another of the big outbursts was that early
musical argument for the rights of Woman :
Donizetti’s “Lucy of Lammermoor.” In this
perfect specimen of man’s inhumanity to
woman in the days when chivalry was more
talked about than worn, Toti’s vocal flights
were exactly as one had remembered them
in the opera. A group of Spanish songs and
nio < l < l“ e^ tic . inte^ lude called “ The Cuckoo
-i - . ' Vl rn ,' v !' ' Then having sung about
Tot l beckoned the volatile Augusto
a' t , ier f lde , and with hand and voice
p e y°, the bill with a vigorous “Don
• duet. Of the baritone it may be
mo- d n le ha ®i?. ore o£ the Power than the glory,
. lls rattling rendering of Figaro’s eata-
toue ot Ins own usefulnesses put him at
•i w i, . hearers, who warmed up to
wild enthusiasm over his “Toreador.” If
pianist \\ llham James had stuck to the
~ m ! , . composers it might have been as
much his night as the songbirds’. His De-
nussy numbers were exquisite. Flautist
i tanley Baines poured out tender melancholy
like some gentle shepherd on a delicately bar-
bered Arcadian slope where the lambs are
never shorn but only marcelled and shingled.
Nellie Stewart’s voice was the most sur-
pnsing feature of the performance of “Sweet
Nell of Old Drury” at Sydney G.O.H. on
Saturday night. That voice held no betrayal
that its owner was not really the cheeky
apple-girl of the opening act, standing im-
prudently on the threshold of life. Further,
the enunciation was clear, and there was
no loss of the old power to express all moods.
In her saucy exchanges with Lady Castle-
maine (Marie Eaton) and the Duchess of
Portsmouth (Sylvia Clifton), Miss Stewart
was as spirited as ever, although only the
former gave anything like the proper sharp-
ness to the feminine rapier play. As the
blase Charles, wearied by his philanderings
and refreshed by the unspoiled honesty of
the orange-girl, Arthur Greenaway gave great
help; Leslie Woods was a sufficiently snarl-
ing Jeffreys; while Tom Cannam, who has
spent many years in small-town acting since
he was last known on the Sydney stage,
made Percival the typical broken-down
Crummies. The others (with Arthur Shir-
ley as a meaty but stiff Sir Roger Fairfax)
were undistinguished. The settings are
apparently those of the original production
and are well preserved; the opening stage-
picture, a street in Old London, makes a
very good introduction to the old-world
comedy. The revival is only for one week:
Sweet Nell will pack away her brocades
again after to-morrow (Friday) night.

“Rose Marie,” at Sydney Majesty’s, con-
tinues to earn the fat interest on the £25,000
which was spent on the production. Frank
Harvey is finding his “Seventh Heaven” at
the Royal nightly and twice a week at
matinees; but by the time this sees light
“White Cargo” will have vanished from the
Palace. Renee Kelly and “Daddy Longlegs”
are also in their last nights at the Criterion.
At the St. James’s “No, No, Nanette,” goes
on providing its cocktail of color, music and
mirth.

Nellie Bramley will commence to be “The
Misleading Lady” at Sydney Palace on
Saturday. The lady’s husband, manager
Russell, introduces “Our Liz” at the Grand
Opera House on the same evening—-a musi-
cal-comedy offering said to have had 1757
performances in England.
MELBOURNE TIVOLI.
Fred Bluett mid Roy Rene in a nautical
concerto.
Bertie Torzillo, with a large-sized sample
of the instrument that angels use, and Elsie
Peerless, with a voice having some angelic
qualities, meet on this week’s Tivoli bill. Rex
Story and Lee Rose serve passable songs
with patter sauce, and the Janetski Trio
provide musical trickery. Outside these, the
programme, while maintaining a good qual-
ity, has nothing new.

A Strenuous Battery Test.
The batteries on Miss Violette Cordery’s Invicta car, on
which she recently set up several new records on the Italian
Monza track, were put to a very severe test before the event.
According to the rules governing these records, if for any reason
the car stops on any part of the track the driver may not have
any assistance in bringing it round to the replenishing depot.
Consequently, as the car is not too easy for one person to push
for perhaps two miles, Invicta Cars decided, before making the
above record-breaking attempt, to discover how far the starter
battery would drive the car on top gear with the engine switched
off and against compression. A standard Invicta car was taken
at random, and on a level road the engine was stopped and
the car driven solely by the Exide starter batteries for one
mile at a speed of about 3 m.p.h. At the end of a mile the
voltmeter still showed over 12 volts. The following morning
the same Exide batteries, with no recharging, started the engine
at once from cold. Exide batteries, for all their excellence,
can have given no better indication than this of their great
efficiency and durability.

CAVAN DERS LT?
LONDON.
Kay Lougford’s “The Pioneers, shown
this 'week at the (Lyceum (Sydney), calls
for a bucketful of hard words. Built on
an orthodox:! story of Australiau busn-litc
(it is adapted froin a book which won a
prize offered by an .English publishing farm),
the picture has ingredients that make it
superior to many imported films; but the
cheese-paring of the local film-maker is too
painful altogether. The backers of these
productions arfc helping to kill the sentiment
in favoir of locsal pictures by trading upon it,
instead of incurring that slight extra expense
which would ensure perfect pictures. In
America producers are prepared to ‘shoot
scenes time and again in order to secure
perfection; in “The Pioneers” several faulty
scenes have been allowed to pass into the
picture,; and the explanatory “cut-ins are
stodgy. Hoyt's features Pauline Frederick s
piled-up emotion in “Sting of the Lash.
Gloria Swanson in the amusing Stage
Struck” wears -.some amazing clothes —and
near-clothes. The whole box of tiicks asso-
ciated with “The Wanderer” continues to
make the Prince “Edward a popular resort.

Grace and Kelats, newcomers to I ullers
(Sydney), d'estervfe the applause they win for
their old-fashioned song-medley; otherwise
they provide only! a moderate turn of songs
and stories, mostly moss-grown. Hector St.
Clair has his audience well gripped, and
Harry Walden is likewise in favor. "Ihe
Troubles of Tiectlor” occupy Jim Gerald’s
attention, and give Reg. Hawthorne a special
chance to shine.

Sydney seems to have decided that the
Fullers’ show at the Hippodrome is the next
best thing to a, pantomime; Saturday’s audi-
ences were well sprinkled with children. The
Midgets give a mixed show which would be
good in spots even if it wasn’t salted by
the quaintnessi of the little people; the
dancing of the Charleston by a hop-o-my-
thumb little lady was a specially vimful
act. Chefalo is a magician of parts who
prompted his juvenile audiences to ejacu-
lations of wonder. In one trick he tears
the heads from as live duck and a live rooster,
and presents the birds to the audience deco-
rated with the wrong heads, but not greatly
concerned about the accident that has hap-
pened to them.

A show with'the camera’s help :
The art of using a photographic camera to pro-
duce a picture that doesn’t look as if it had been
anywhere near one goes on from height to height.
The show staged by , the Australian Salon of Photo-
graphy, at Farmer’s, (Sydney), numbers hardly one
real dud. One is ilempted to add that there isn’t
one real photograph,: but that might be proved to be
a base libel on as high-souled a bunch of artists
as ever printed in a sky or pounded heavily with a
bromoil brush. There are landscapes that exhale
the flavor of Corot, portraits that Sargent might
have posed, and compositions in which fog, smoke
and steam are rendered in a manner reminiscent of
Turner and Jimmy Whistler in their most auda-
cious moments. All -in monochrome, and mostly in
greys at that, these pictures, with their unerring
draughtsmanship and sweet restfulness, are less
fatiguing to look at than the purely hand-made
product—possibly because they are shallower. All
the same, a picture is a picture, no matter how it
is made, and some of the exhibits in this year’s
show are really beautiful in a decorative way. The
few figure studies are disappointing and the treat-
ment of the nude, attempted in only three or four
cases, is not effective. A fair proportion of the
exhibits depict foreign subjects—Venice, London,
Tokio and Amsterdam —but some of the most pic-
turesque patches have been discovered in and around
Sydney. Some of these bromide, bromoil and plat-
inotype prints look like wash drawings, others like
etchings; some even suggest pastel work or pen-
and-ink. They belong to a world far removed from
that of the flapper who takes snapshots at picnics.

The week at Adelaide Royal has seen
more of “Heave It to Jane,” with Athol Tier
uproariously funny and Mona Barlee bright
and effective as the pleasant vamp that
Americans call a “college widow.” Then
more of “Ivatja,” with Marie Burke giving
up politics of the Russian bomb-tlirowing
variety for love; Barrett Lennard in his
own brand of gentlemanly humor; Thelma
Burness, unsmiling, yet funny; and Paul
Plunkett doing good work in a part below
his powers. At the Prince of Wales, in a
rough version of “His Natural Life,” Guy
Hastings, Victor Prince and Ralston stand
out well; but Gabbett’s axe ought to be used
on the comic parson.

From an Adelaide critic: —
The Barringer lady (whose sales ran nearly to
four figures) is succeeded at the Society of Arts
by Leila McNamara, who has studied under both
the Ashtons in Adelaide and has lately been getting
further experience and advice in Sydney. She shows
one study of gums which has brought her a medal
from Wembley, but mainly her subjects are N.S.W.
landscape. The gem is a far-ranging view at Narra-
been.
Poverty
Point
“A.8.W.”: Maurice Dudley has found an
actor’s haven at 3LO, and his voice may
now be heard nightly from
Melbourne to Perth, Cape
York and Maoriland. Dud-
ley put in some good work
with the J. C. Williamson
firm during 25 years, but
character actors of his calibre
are seldom required in these
jazzy revue days. His new
job, from the resting mum-
mer’s point of view, is a
plum, and the old hand
didn’t ask for time “to con-
sider the matter” when offer-
ed it. The listening-in public
will like him.
“Machete”: An unplea-
sant surprise overtook a
batch of N.S.W. country
picture-show proprietors who
had sent in incorrect taxa-
tion returns and were fined
a fiver apiece for the in-
advertence. The Federal de-
partment had simply looked
up the returns received by
the Australian agents of
Yankee film companies from
the unsuspecting showmen;
and these, of course, revealed
that the latter had. enjoyed
much fatter pickings than
they confessed to the tax-
gatherers. One way and
another the department has
many pitfalls set for the un-
wary. The Bulletin may
even be required to make a
list of payments made dur-
ing ■ the year to “Machete,”
including the bob or two he
gets for this paragraph; and
then some departmental
sleuth will probably hunt up
“Machete’s” return to see if
the figures correspond.
“Flaming Youth”: As the old tenants have
vacated the Williamsons’ new property in
Castlereagh-street, Sydney, it would seem
that the Firm means to push on with the
job of building a substitute for the Criterion;
but another Williamson theatre likely to be
earlier on the map will stand in George-
street, next door to the Bathurst-street
branch of the Bank of N. S. Wales, and
almost facing the Crystal Palace. The Firm
will thus get a playhouse at the doorway of
the Town Hall underground station, just as
the Ward-Fuller people have their new
theatre fronting St. James’s station. There
is talk of negotiations for theatre sites both
at Circular Quay and about Wynyard-square,
where other city stations will be. If any-
thing comes of them York-street, which once
possessed two theatres and probably the
first fimusement hall built in Sydney by con-
victs, will get back some of its Thespian
glory.
“Curtain-raiser”: Melbourne critics are
wailing about desecration of the sacred text
in the present production of “The Mikado.”
They object particularly to the substitution
of “Little Bourke-street” for “Knightsbridge”
and “prohibitionist” for “lady novelist” and
to references to Alex. Peacock s voice and
Bruce’s spats. This sort of thing can easily
go too far, but in the Melbourne case the
objectors are querulous without reason. Gil-
bert himself authorised tue use of a local
name for Knightsbridge and altered lady
novelist” to “speed motorist” before he died.
As for the introduction of Australian poli-
ticians, that was done in dumb-show; and
very amusing dumb-show, too.
“Mr. Jaggers”: The spirit of the movies
held high Hollyday at the Sydney Criminal
Court recently, when a youth was convicted
of complicity in a fatal abortion case. The
lad had submitted to blood transfusion in
the attempt to save his sweetheart’s life,
thereby establishing a genuine claim on
the sympathy of all who heard the
case. But his tears and contortions
while the evidence was being taken
and his address to the jury from the dock,
broken with sobs, were in the true film vein:
“I loved her better than the whole world. ....
She was a wonderful girl”.... ending with
a full-length collapse on the dock bench.
Through its tears the jury wailed for mercy,
and Justice Gordon bound the youngster
over to be good for 12 months. My reward
lay in watching the producer, or, as they say
up at Dario, counsel for the defence. His
artistic restraint was wonderful, though it
failed to conceal his honest if unvoiced
pride in the product of his genius.
“Bill Ding”: There is. no go-slow about
the W.A. Repertory Society and its tribu-
taries. The Reps, have lately given the pub-
lic “Brown Sugar,” “The Man-eaters,”
“Fanny’s First Play” and “The Thirteenth
Chair,” and the Concert Artists follow with
“The Orchid.” In future they will be able
to hire the renovated Town Hall, the stage
appointments of which must rank among
the best in Australia. Artist Ramage has
painted a woodland. set which is worthy of
the Colemans in their inspired moments,
A PROFITEER.
T HE ARTIST: “ He’s as mean as a microbe. Actually
offered me five shillings for one of my sketches!”
THE MODEL : “And I’m sure that was only because be-
thought it might be worth seven and six when
you’re dead.”
while the proscenium, set off with columns,
friezes and curtains, is a thing of beauty.
“Short Circuit”: Frank Neil’s comedians
have finished a long run with “The Nervous
Wreck” at Melbourne Palace. Neil himself,
who learnt his business in the rough and
tumble of “Bohemian” Cole’s outbreaks,
played Henry Williams, the hypochondriac
“wreck.” The groundlings guffawed every
time Frank jabbed a clinical thermometer in
his mouth to see if his temperature had
gone up, but in point of fact he read the
thermometer anxiously at each inspection,
being a really sick man. Again and again
liis temperature was well over 100, but he
carried on pluckily.
“Gmsar’s Ghost”: George Palmer, first
mentioned 18 months ago in The Bul-
letin as the 15-year-old film-maker of
Surrey Hills (Melb.), has completed a tour
of Victoria, N. S. Wales and Queensland,
where he has been looking after his interest
in his picture, “The Mail Robber”; it has
figured on the programmes of a multitude of
country houses. The youngster, who was
17 a month ago, has now a substantial bank
balance, which he is putting into a more
ambitious film, with a daughter of Harold
Nelson,' M.11.R., in the role of heroine. If
he doesn’t break his neck in some of his
stunts the youngster will go far. Already
American film people have been interested by
his exploits.
“Wigs”: Apart from Gilbert and Sullivan
operas and J. M. Barrie’s pieces, our stage
has nothing to show these nights but Ameri-
can plays. There are six of them on view
in Sydney and four in Melbourne. As it
has come to light that J. C. Williamson gave
£lOOO for the Australian rights of the quite
ordinary comedy “His Ladv Friends,” the
tribute sent to Uncle Sam for the present
batch must be colossal. I suppose the idea
of risking a few thousands on an Australian
play—say, one with a Digger hero —would
be ridiculed by the controllers of the Aus-
tralian stage.
“Tabra” : Brisbane is the morgue of visiting
theatrical shows. Company after company
comes in with a flourish and slips out with
a crash. After the finish of the Rcynolds-
de Tisne co. at the Royal, the “Fatal Wed-
ding” people played a disastrous season there.
Then Reynolds tried to come back, but
couldn’t. The “Snap” co. broke short, and
the “Crackers” of Cremorne have spluttered
out. Some of the Cracker girls were left
on the wharf, with their luggage piled around
them; but Brisbane is so used to that sort
of thin" that the papers didn’t think it
worth mentioning.
“Centurion”: A reviewer of “Rose Marie,”
referring to its Canadian setting, wonders
why we don’t see something similar with a
purely Australian atmosphere. The answer
is, of course, that our managements won’t
take chances with home-grown productions
when they can get cheaper stuff which has
succeeded abroad. The late Brunton Stephens,
who was no mean lyrist and humorist, wrote
at least two striking books. I
was present at a private reading of one,
“Fayette,” which dealt with the adventures
of a theatrical co. touring in western Queens-
land, and remember being struck with the
high standard of the lyrics in a day when
W. S. Gilbert was in his prime. Years
later Stephens told me he had never been
able to find a manager who would take the
slightest interest in his bantlings.
“Hamfat”: No cleverer little character-
actress has been seen in Sydney for years
than Lorna Helms, who has given a couple
of hilarious slavey studies, and was the
“straight” heroine in “Give and Take.”
Lorna is off now to seek fortune in London,
dengue and a subsequent more serious illness
having obliged her to hand in her part in
the Henry Green mirthmaker; Vera Spaull
takes her place. By the way, “Give and
Take,” besides bringing Roy Rene, after he
had split with “Stiffy” and the Fullers, to a
contract with Williamsons for Tivoli work,
has earned a chance for Lou Vernon, who
has a prominent part in “Rose Marie.” The
Carrolls did very well out of it: in fact, it
seems to have brought everyone luck except
Lorna Helms. And even she may live. to
look back upon the occasion of her going
abroad as a blessing in disguise.
“A.G.M.” (Lond.) : “Loose Ends,” by
Geoffrey Warren, is a very interesting play
which has had its first production at the
Duke of York’s. “Geoffrey Warren” is m
reality Dion Titheradge, who in addition, to
writing the piece took the chief role him-
self and won eulogies. The play deals with
a set of cynical degenerates of cocktail habits,
including a fashionable actress, an. Eton-
cropped girl half ashamed of her femininity,
and a man who has served 15 years for a
murder. It is on serious lines, the question
as to the justification of the murder is dealt
with in a very interesting way, the char-
acterisation (with two striking exceptions)
is sound, and it would take very little
to make it a very fine play. Mr. Tith-
eradge was called on to make a speech on
the first night, and facetiously announced that
“the author is not in the audience.” It says
something for the toleration of the critics
that, although in this as in a previous effort
the author introduced an offensive caricature
of a journalist, all the newspapers have been
more than generous in their appreciation.
“Hamfat”: Poor old Jack Cosgrove was
so fond of telling similar stories about him-
self that he would probably have enjoyed the
one my friend Dudley Dash told me the other
day. A chance acquaintance had got into
conversation with Dudley about old stage
identities, claiming personal friendship with
them. He had known Dampier, Rignold,
Holloway, Julius Knight, Plimmer, Roberts
—the whole lot of them. “All the time I
had the idea that he was an affable liar,”
said Dudley, “so I asked him, ‘Did you know
Jack Cosgrove?’ ‘Jack Cosgrove! I should
say I did know Jack Cosgrove!’ he says.
‘Why, Jack was a pal of mine!’ ‘Did he
ever borrow money from you?’ I asked. I
thought he might really have known poor old
Jack but a moment later I knew him for
the fraud he was. Why, the damned liar
assured me that Jack returned it!”
THE FINAL RESORT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Of course on the vaudeville stage my motto was
‘When in doubt fall about.’ ” — Comedian’s candid
confession.
I’m a pro. who has no
High art claims to boast of;
Bluish gags, red nose, “bags’'—
These l make the most of ;
Wheezes that knock ’em flat
I have got a host of;
And this motto oft I spout—
“ When in doubt fall about!”
The legit, for a bit
I confess I’ve tasted;
Learnt a part—real art !
All my talent wasted;
Not one I with a pie
In the drama pasted;
Highbrows there my methods scout—
“ When in doubt fall about!”
Vaudeville, topping bill,
Sure of recognition ;
To that show back I go—
Gratified ambition.
How I score! Hear ’em roar—
That’s a comic’s mission.
If they don’t roar, then there’s nowt
Left to do but fall about!

Just slip the strop through the slot provided in the head
and then 10 seconds’ stropping. Each day a blade as
keen and eager to do its work as when it came out of its
original wrapper. Forty or fifty easy, clean shaves from
the same blade is nothing out of the ordinary for a Valet.

Have You Made Your Application Yet?
This purely finance Company is already operating profitably upon its capital
so far subscribed, and dividends may confidently be expected on the first yearly
balance. We make the latter statement from the fact that the subscription of capital
has been phenomenal, while the ascertained scope of business offering on a selective
and contractual basis is sufficient to absorb the full capital of the Company.
The share list contains the names of some of the keenest financial authorities
in Australia. Again we invite you to follow the lead given by experts, but —the
opportunity passes.
Do not confuse this Company with any other Motor and General Finance
Company.
There is only one Australian Securities, Limited, and such an opportunity as
this to invest your money with the utmost security and assured dividends may
not present itself again for a decade.
Your money, in the hand? of the most highly qualified administration is
immediately transformed into interest-bearing securities of a select type, which
may then be pyramided into compound credit, as per the “Pyramid of Compound
Credit.” The latter document is based upon the table invented by Mr. Egerton, of
Union Mortgage, Ltd., of California. It should be read by every layman who wishes
to understand this latest and most fascinating development of 20th Century Finance.
The Security of the Investment is even better than the proverbial bricks and
mortar, because—
1. The Company remains the legal owner of the property on which it lends
its own money, and other moneys that accrue by the process of pyramiding, until
the last instalment is paid.
2. The Company insures the property at the expense of the buyer against damage
from fire, accident, theft or any other risk whatever.
3. The purchaser is responsible for the due payment of his promissory notes
given as cover for the balance of unpaid purchase money.
4. The seller, usually a strong company, is also liable as endorser of the
purchaser’s promissory notes.
5. The due payment of amount owing is insured with an established insurance
company.
The investment is likely to be highly lucrative, because—
1. The management of the Company’s business is in the hands of men of the
very highest repute in the business world.
2. The profits earned by similar companies operating in Australia or in America
have been phenomenal.
3. The overheads are limited to the requirements of a central office. No plant
or other depreciable property is involved. The Company’s capital appreciates with
each transaction.

Copy of letter received from Mr. G. 31. Dash, Organiser of Commonwealth and
_ State Loans totalling nearly £300,000,000.
TO THE GENERAL MANAGER, FEDERAL UNDERWRITERS.
10 O’Connell Street, Sydney . 3/6/’26.
Dear Sir, —This is the first occasion upon which T have ever suggested
subscription to any proposition other than Commonwealth or State loans.
At the present time there is no Commonwealth Loan, open to the public,
and I have no hesitation in advising investors generally to take up parcels of
shares in Australian Securities, Ltd., for I consider it one of the best commercial
propositions I have come across.
Years ago one of our leading Bankers said to me: Investors would be
better off if they spent less time poring over the details of company prospectuses
and spent, more in studying the personnel of the Board of Directors in each
instance.”
In this case, intending investors hare the satisfaction of knowing that the
affairs of the Company will be controlled by a Board of solid business men and
a group of Solicitors, Auditors and Secretaries whose names speak for them-
selves, in the estimation of the community.
My own particular application for shares in this Company teas also influ-
enced very directly when I ascertained the names of those who have already
taken shares, which includes
those of many of the shrewd-
est and most highly regarded
financial men in this State.
Wishing you success,
I am, your faithfully,

I enclose herewith £ being 2/- per Share on application and I agree to

M. Bada: Sorry, but we can’t swallow
O’Reilly... .S.F.A.C.: Too much preliminary song
and dance to introduce two or three mostly familiar
anecdotes. But it is well enough done... .Bracken:
The Bulletin would rather pay for what it prints.
Indicate the paragraph (date, page and column) in
your claim, and send to the accountant. ... Guffin:
Well, the man who writes this answer knows why
his father let the hunt pass through even his young
crop. All those hunters ate hay, and the owners of
some of them were his very good customers....
W. 8.: “Bit of Verse” came to the very brink of
acceptance.... Sike: It is only this confounded lack
of space that drives it away.... J.H.0.G.: Dull, and.
against two things the gods of The Bulletin fight
hardest —dirt and dullness... .S.R.P.: Good subject,
not very attractively handled; and you don’t say
what State you are talking about.... Felix: We can
do nothing with typewritten copy that packs 427
words into five inches of space.... Bobs: Thanks;
but it wouldn’t do others much good, would it?....
0.K.H.: Much obliged; glad to hear from y0u....
Gidgi: Hopeless... .Jim P.: Cheerful request for
entombment granted... .E.K.: Crudeness spoils it;
you should be able to mend that by study of verse
methods and by practice.... J.R.L.: If your verse is
paid: of “The Aftermath' of War” it should be a
solemn warning to the nations.... Clown: “The
Jest” is a trite statement that he kissed you with
fatal results.... H. 8.: Too trifling... .E.M.J.: “Thy
grave is under this oak-tree.” Tombs under oak-trees
are prohibited in The Bulletin. .. .Della: Nice type,
nasty tripe.... L.L.: Prettily told; but mere words
describing a shy lover’s hesitancy don’t make a story.
. ...J.R.C.: Your “Warm Fire” leaves us c01d....
Satan: “The Turning of the Worm” should have
been acomplished in one-eighth of the space. There-
fore your worm re-turns.... Sedly: Good idea, poorly
used, in the punter who got “the oil” from the
parson’s sermons.... T.C.: “My teeth clenched with
determination. ‘Hilda,’ I hissed, ‘you must—you
shall —be mine.’” Unhand her, villain !.... S.T.S.:
As; you are only 18, your verse is really remarkable
—for its sorrows. You catalogue four tombs, a
jugful of “parting tears” and a hatful of sorrows.
God save you, merry gentleman!... .T. 8.: Your
poetic shoots were so tender that the office cow
mistook them for grass.... Salt: Same thing has
been done before—long before. And overdone, lately.
... .S.R.P.: Both the title (“Poor Spotted Lil”) and
the note (*Poets lissence”) appeal to us; so here
goes:—
She stole ten bob from me,
But I do not mind the loss,
For I know that she, like’s the way with me,
Has got to bear her Cross.
For why should I talk about her sin,
Though if she did intend to rob ?
If I hadn’t been after sin myself.
Could she have stolen my ten bob ?
So why should I think hard of her?
She was chrissened long ago,
And there was no Sin about her then,
In her chriss’ning robe of sno.*
Though she is in the gutter now.
And drinks are often on her brow,
Aud curses hard, there’s one good point in Lil—
She always loved her mother an’ she loves
her mother still.
.... Chas. R.: Murder somebody yourself; and if
the policeman who arrests you lets you go on the
spot because he feels that your act is justified,
write and tell us about it....T.G.: You have cer-
tainly buried her in words.... Ada I.: The sorrow-
ing ma stepped right out of an American fillum....
Horace L.: By our halidom, no! Do your heroes
always use that stilted language?... .T.McG.: The
brightest feature in your screed was the spelling.
We have never seen “Utercaliptus” spelt that way
before... ,8.F.: Its worst fault is in its heavy, stilted
phrases and pretentiousness and its weak line-
endings ; and why fling so much mythology into an
Australian rainstorm? You ought to do good work.
B.V.: You started to tell a story; but you left
off Thermos: Nothing in the flask you sent
G. : Don’t you fear to write verses like that in
S.A., where, you say, murder goes unpunished?...,.
Ignotus: For one great moment the phrase “sausage
hate” attracted us. Then it appeared that it was
really only “savage” hate, and we lost interest....
Fun: Improved; will do.... Spike: Stop! For youi
tread is on an umpire’s dust!... .R.C.: “The Vision”
may fulfil your dreams. Others too slight. . .E.F.W.:
Nicely told, but tame as the domestic cat in his
fireside m00d.... Jarkgoe: There have been more
exciting things about “Royal Park at Night” than
your verse, which is very slight... .W. 8.: Your “Mus-
ings” should go direct to the girl; the general
reader would find no interest in them... .Vibrate:
Sorry, both miss... .E.D.: Very nearly... .R.F.C.:
The first two stanzas spoil them.... D.H.: Can’t
accept delivery.... Isabel H.: Reads like a gasp be -
tween two kisses.... Visconti: Trying to make us
blush at the “bare” idea?.. . .1.L.1.: Overstrained
possibilities not made convincing enough... .E.W.:
Goanna race-story doesn’t run we 11.... M.M.8.: As
verse your unnamed contribution is illegitimate.
... .Mount: Not up to standard.. . .Johnny W.:
“Vanity” is in vain... .M.D.: Only a somewhat sup.
ref. “In Memoriam” verse... .D.M.M.: “Captive,”
“Enslaved” —why not get away from that mental
Pentridge? The stuff is fair quality... .H.J.8.:
“The Singer” doesn’t sustain his note. . . .F.E.R.:
Sorry; just fails....W. Mest: “Leaves” tuneful;
but there are lines whose meaning is too obscure.
....A Tarrier; The climax isn’t effective... .Allan
C.: Almost did it. But the picture of the lady
isn’t repellent enough... .W.S. (Otago) : Wouldn’t
be understood outside the neighborhood.... Max A.:
Wish you’d put as good writing into a less gloomy
yarn J.8.T.: The telling of “Bluey” is too arti-
ficial. .. .Wanderer: Trite, but nice work in it. Do
some more....Mea: Quite likely that E. W. Cole
had a bookstall on the Castlemaine diggings before
he went to Melbourne in ’64.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
G.T.: It isn’t a good plan to use an umbrella
with broken ribs as a substitute for a human model.
. ...T.L.: Your inky wriggles don’t suggest that
your talent lies that way....G.R.: Why drag in an
invisible “voice over the telephone” when the johnny
at the box-office window would have served the
purpose?... .F.J.: Throw the nutmeg-grater away and
buy a drawing-pen. ... A.E.T.: The newehum and the
farmer are a muddled pair,.. .S.S.: Suspect that the
misogynist is at heart a giddy old ankle-gazer... .
H. : You seem chained to one spot... .G.H.:
Below standard R.H.: We would adopt your idea
for immortalising The Bulletin in an intricate
design of crossed flappers’ legs only for the prohibitive
cost of silk stockings.

Food
in
Middle
In middle age men and
women alike undergo many
natural changes.
It is noticeable that the
digestive and nervous sys-
tems become upset more
easily. Then, because the
ability to obtain nourishment
from ordinary food is im-
paired, health falls “below
par” and the little things of
life continue to fret and
worry.

Food
rests and soothes the diges-
tive system, and is a power-
ful aid in restoring health
and natural nutrition.

The New Method of Shaving
NO BRUSH. NO SOAP.
d
ď
f
Is it not strange that for hundreds of years man has
been scrubbing his face with soaps full of Soda and
has never reasoned that under such treatment the skin
must suffer? Nothing is more ugly than a face that
looks raw. Shaving soaps are always the same old method
of shaving. They are made with Soda.
But now we have discovered the natural method where
no bush and soaps full of soda are needed. Shavex is a
skin food. One can shave in half the time, and you
will get a smoother and closer shave than you have ever
had, and shaving will become a pleasure instead of a tor-
ture. Your skin will look and feel like satin, and your
face under this treatment will look twice as young. No
after lotions are required when using
SHAVEX
Mr. LESLIE HENSON the famous
actor, writes: —"I use ‘Shavex’ every
time 1 shave, and think it is the quick-
est, cleanest and most delightful pre-
paration ever invented for shaving.’’

British Cars for l
British People ■
The new Sunbeam three-litre sporting
car is the finest ever produced. It
embodies all the experience in engine
design and chassis construction which
has made Sunbeam cars supreme in the
racing world. Its body work is typical
of Sunbeam easy luxury and fine
appearance, and it comes as a worthy
addition to the fine range of touring
models which are already famous for
their inimitable performance and re-
liability.

“Alwyn”: The longest valid property lease
ever registered in Australasian real-estate
history is for a piece of land in Dunedin
(M.L.), a right-of-way separating the Bank
of N.Z. from the National Insurance Com-
pany. It has been leased for 10,000 years.
* * * *
“Clerk’: In preparation for the running
of the heavy “Pacific” loco., 200 men are
replacing the 26-year-old 801 b. rails between
Melbourne and Seymour with 901 b. type, and
at the same time re-sleepering and raising
the track an average of three inches. The
whole track right through to Albury will
be eventually relaid without any interrup-
tion to traffic, and the 190-mile run should
then be equal to the best in Australia. The
thrifty Clapp is seeing that all the discarded
rails, sleepers, bolts and fishplates are re-
used on lines with lighter traffic.
* * * #
“Petrie”: Brisbane investigators, taking
stock of Queensland’s manufactures, have
stumbled on a number of little-known indus-
tries. An umbrella factory employs 35
hands. Pottery-making is carried on prin-
cipally by disabled Diggers under the super-
vision of the Red Cross, and really excellent
work is being turned out. Toy-making, also
availed of by ex-soldiers, is languishing owing
to foreign competition. Furniture-making is
flourishing, and factories which specialise in
office equipment are doing particularly well.
Many of the labor-saving devices for business
offices—loose-leaf ledgers, filing cabinets, etc.
-—are of Queensland invention, as well as
manufacture.
* * * *
“Sixenate”: The responsibility still rests
•upon the pub-keeper to supply accommoda-
tion for “man and beast” in return for his
license, but it is so' long since anybody has
ridden up to hotels like the Australia and
Menzies’ and called for stabling for his nag,
that the obligation towards Dobbin has long
been forgotten in the cities. The country
pubkeeper, however, is still required to keep
a stable going, and the advance or the motor
has brought with it a new obligation. The
licensing inspector in the Maitland (N.S.W.)
district lias issued orders to a number of
publicans to erect garages, and so far. there
have been no kicks, garage fees being profit-
able enough.
* * * *
“Harold Hardupp”: A new lane across
Sydney Harbor is proposed in the form of
a ferry from Woolloomooloo Bay to Cre-
morne. The Sydney Ferries are prepared
to go ahead if the municipalities, north
and south, provide the necessary docking
at each end, and undertake to make roads
capable of bearing heavy traffic. Even with
the bridge completed the short cut will be a
benefit, especially to people who live in the
Eastern Suburbs and want to get to Mosman
and its surroundings, or vice versa. At
present the punt hold-up in busy times on
the Macquarie-Kirribilli Point connection is
a purgatory to motorists, who sometimes
make a queue a good half-mile long.
* * * *
“8.A.5.” (Antwerp) : The descent of the
Belgian franc to 130 to the £1 brought me
here for a cheap holiday. Within an hour
of arriving I found myself gazing into a win-
dow dressed with nothing but tins of
Hawaiian pineapples. Dozens of photo-
graphs - illustrated the life-history of the
pine, from planting-stage to tinned perfec-
tion. I turned from the display to see a
barrow being drawn through the streets
advertising the same brand of fruit. Why
cannot Australia emulate these methods? Has
the Queensland Government never grasped
what a market there is on the Continent of
Europe for its wares ? Does Joe Cook never
take a trip over this way?
* * * *
“Pakehaha”: Auckland (M.L.) was in
grave danger recently when it became en-
tirely waterless owing to the breakdown of
its two main supplies. M.L. cities are
almost entirely built of wood plus borer, and
many of the houses are as much as 40 years
old and drier than a summer's day at Ood-
nadatta. Wellington was for a few hours in
the same situation one morning a few years
ago. Wellington-terrace was completly cut
off from the mains, and a fire seized the
opportunity to break out in a side street.
The brigade joined all its hoses together and
brought water nearly a mile from Kelburn,
but it was only a trickle. Within a few
minutes 11 houses were ablaze. Welling-
ton’s winds happened to be sleeping that day,
or half the city might easily have gone.
What the insurance companies think about
it is reflected in their rates. I paid per fort-
night the same premium for a des. det. res.
in Wellington as a Sydney co. asks per
annum for a brick house of about equal size.
Maoriland is paying a heavy price for its
use of the handiest building material.
* * * *
“Adelaide Solicitor”: “Rex” is right
(B. 15/4/’26) and “Two Seas” wrong (B.
20/5/’26) about the relative payment to
lawyer and land-agent on sales of land; any-
way, so tar as South Aus. is concerned.
Almost all the- land in the State is under
the Real Property Act (originally invented
here, by the way), and a guinea (the Act
definitely names £1) is the customary law-
yer’s reward for a transfer, without any
regard to the value of the land sold. Lately
a well-to-do client sold his big farm. I got
his signature to the transfer, and attended
the settling, charging him two guineas,
which was ample for the work done. The
agent deducted £lO5 as his reward. My
client was not a man to remain idle, anil
within a month he had bought a bigger
place. This time I had to prepare the
documents, and charged three guineas; the
settling was in the same office, and the same
agent collected £ll5. Again, I had a settle-
ment with a small land-agent, one I had
never heard of before. His commission was
£25 odd, and he apologised for being a
bit behind-liand, as this was his fifth settling
on the same day. As “Rex” claims, it
does make a hard-working lawyer thought-
ful. I know all the arguments on the other
side —payment only by results, motor-car
everlastingly at call, resultless trips, and
so on—but I still think the scale is fixed
too high. By the way, the agent can quite
lawfully do all Real Property Act work
himself ; so wherever possible he prepares
the transfer, and collars the guinea as well.

THE LAW OF COMPENSATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“In a recent day’s list of peisons accused of
offences ranging from drunk and disorderly to
embezzlement and housebreaking in Sydney, the
Christian name James appeared 22 times.’’
It always seemed, in childhood’s days,
The haloes hung on James ; in him
One glimpsed the lad of model ways,
Still virtuous though we called him Jim.
The knave that showed in any pack
AVas always bound to be a Jack.
James won the prize at Sunday-school;
He seldom needed spur or curb;
He knew his grammar, rule by rule;
His composition was superb.
’Tis somewhat sadd’ning to reflect
His sentences are still correct.
For James, full-grown, has slipped a lot.
His money at the trots he drops;
He makes the pace with booze too hot,
And otherwise stirs up the Hops,
Whilst Jack perhaps is now the John
Who puts Jim’s pot severely on.
Myself, who sowed my wild oats young,
Xow find delight in crops of grace.
You’ll find me pious saints among,
Or set in some churchwarden’s place.
Sin I eschew for loftier aims,
But still it’s carried on —by James!
N.S.W.
HAROLD HARDUPP.
“Emel”: Speaking of things that get into
tins (B. 20/5/’2G). Some years ago the
manager of the Drouin (Vic.) butter
factory used to enliven the district with a
weekly report in the local paper of the
articles found in cream cans. The prize
find was a young pig!
Dr. W. H. Woolnough, the new presi-
dent of the Royal Society of N.S.W., was
the first-fruit of the science course at the
Sydney Uni.; he holds the first degree
issued—in 1898. Immediately afterwards
he became assistant to Prof. David, and he
has since been in and out of various pro-
fessorial chairs —he finds it hard work to
settle down when Nature is calling to him
from all over the world to come and explore
her.
“Shed Hand”: The stripping of wrecked
and broken motor-cars is not confined to Vic.
or to cars that have smashed some vital part
of their mechanism on the road. In Westra-
lia so many new cars consigned by rail in-
land have been robbed of spare parts m
transit that nowadays as few accessories as
possible are loaded with the vehicle, the tools
and such-like being cased and forwarded
in sealed and covered trucks with such choice
company as whisky and tobacco.
“Adelaide”: There has been a pleasant
sequel to the £2OOO bond-robbery from a
sporting lawyer’s office in Adelaide; in fact,
the second act was played just about the day
when “Mars” was describing in print (I>.
20/5/’26) the first act. The taker, though
a thief, was no hog. He must have found
the higher-denomination bonds impossible to
negotiate with safety; so, instead of destroy-
ing or hiding or losing them, he returned
them to the owner’s office as mysteriously as
they were taken away.
“Ashton”: Bananaland’s Theodore is a
quick thinker. He was waiting for his wife
on a Spring Hill corner when a tall cove
much the worse for wear accosted him. After
many and profuse expressions of regret at
the late Premier’s bad luck in the Federal
election the earbiter said: “By the bye, Ted,
how about a few bob?” Just here the politi-
cian’s wife arrived opportunely on the scene.
Grasping the astonished applicant by the
hand, Theodore took an abrupt departure.
“Thanks, thanks all the same, old man,” he
said, “but I still have a few bob left.”
Brisbane’s much-discussed ratcatcher-ex-
traordinary, Edward Vincent, has resigned
after a reign of five months. He produced
remarkable results, but aldermen were con-
tinually carping at his high salary (£6OO
p. a .), and, still more, some of them, because
lie was doing twice as much with 28
men as was formerly done with 44. In the
first quarter of this year, with his reduced
staff, Vincent accounted for 26,103 rats and
mice ; in the previous quarter, under the old
system, the catch was only 10,145. And he
reduced the cost per rat from 4s. Bd. to
Is. lid.
“M.G.S.” : An unusual case was considered
by the Public Service Arbitrator in Vic. the
other day. It was a plea for higher wages
on account of the risk of their job from the
men employed at the menagerie maintained
by the Commonwealth Serum I laboratory.
Horses, sheep, goats, monkeys, rats, guinea-
pigs and rabbits, converted into walking
dens of diphtheria, tetanus and other unplea-
sant troubles, have to be cared for. Two
men have been infected. They were, of
course, promptly treated with the appro-
priate anti-toxins, but they didn’t like it.
The petitioners were granted a slight in-
crease.
Australians manage to push to the front
everywhere. A few weeks ago Henry Howard
answered a “call” to the richest Presbyterian
Church in the world, in New York. Another
Australian, Dr. Frederick William Norwood,
born in Melbourne, is the pastor of London’s
big Nonconformist tabernacle, the City
Temple, successor to such orators as R. ,J.
Campbell and Dr. Joe Parker. Norwood
was a messenger-boy in his native city when
the desire to be a preacher came to him, and
he worked his way into Ormond College.
Besides a million (or so) sermons, lie lias
produced three books, one of them “Sun-
shine and Wattlegold.”
“C.Q.”: Few people who rush or walk
along St. Kilda-road, Melbourne, realise
that, besides using one of the world’s finest
boulevards, they are treading a monument
to Australian enterprise. In building the
tramway that runs along it 2,000,000 wood-
blocks, 2400 tons of rails, 13,000 sleepers,
75,000 bags of cement and 180,000 bolts,
screws and spikes were used; and as the
board responsible for the construction is
pledged to Australian preference, very little
came from outside the Commonwealth. At
one corner is the biggest manganese cross-
ing in Australia —these crossings were always
imported until an, Australian co. lately de-
monstrated t-hat it could do the work. Fifteen
different kinds of Australian wood are used
in. the cars that run on the line, and the
rails came from Newcastle.

“I always use

(Miss) BESSIE
CLIFFORD.
The Use of Rexona Soap
Ensures Beauty to Skin and Hair.
That natural beauty of skin and hair which cannot be imitated can be obtained by regular
use of Rexona Skin and Facial Soap. Ordinary toilet soaps do not assert this influence. Many
of them contain free alkali, which tends to dry the skin and destroy its delicate texture. Even
the best of such soaps can only cleanse; they cannot heal and protect the skin.
Rexona Soap contains the .same soothing
Rapid Healer, the value of
which in the treatment of skin
affections is known throughout
the world. Simply use Rexona
Skin and Facial Soap regularly
once or- twice a day, and see if
it does not quickly soothe and
cleanse the pores, lessen the
tendency to pimples, and leave
the complexion 'clear, fresh and

What a. lovely
Gift! ”
The Turning Point.
[FFOR THE BULLETIN.]
RADUATION with first-class honors,
I ~]p sincere congratulations from the bishop
on liis ordination, and prospects of an
early “call" to a suburban church were in
harmony with the career which, in days of
adolescence, the Reverend John Darley had
mapped out for himself.
He was healthy and virile, and had out-
stripped the students of his period only by
years of abstinence, even of rigid self-repres-
sion, and sustained mental effort. But now
that bis apprenticeship was over, and his
career about to begin, lie was haunted with
a vague presentiment. For the first time he
had been able to read novels, and his mind
was debauched with confused picturing of
“life,” the pulsing life of great cities, of
which he had been taught nothing, knew no-
thing. “Life,” he had believed, was a mere
cesspool of iniquity, calling for cleansing and
purification, and lie was one of the elected
cleaning staff.
He dropped an unfinished book, filled and
relit his pipe, and, opening a window, moodily
gazed at the vista of glittering city lights
All that he had been taught. . . .it must be
right. And yet, those books! The orthodox
division of emotions and impulses into good
and evil, the sheep and the goats —-might
there not be some wider conception of life?
Out of the confusion in his mind something
at last took shape. He remembered that she
was slim and graceful. The swing of her
body had appealed to him weeks before. But
lie was too absorbed then to dwell on trivial
impressions. He knew that she occupied a
flat in the same building, and now he remem-
bered that, she was always alone, coming and
going with quiet decorum, always tastefully
dressed a desirable woman. He searched
his memory for any other impressions uncon-
sciously stored since she first flitted past,
and found himself trying to visualise her
features. Yes. he remembered now. Her
eyes were large and strangely luminous. She
had once given him one unconcerned glance
and passed on. And there was something
pathetic in her loneliness —he knew what it
was to be lonely. Suddenly he realised the
unusual point of focus of his disordered mns-
ings and resumed liis reading. It was a
volume of O. Henry’s short stories. One of
them arrested his attention, “The Green
Door,” the story of a lonely man who had
stepped from his lodgings to the streets of a
great city resolved to follow to conclusion
the first adventure that might cross his path.
Again the book dropped. Again the swing
of that body caught his fancy. He threw
the book across the room, and, five minutes
later, with all traces of clericalism removed,
the Reverend John was swinging down Ox-
ford-street towards the city.
For the first time the caressing challenge
of a street woman penetrated to his inner
consciousness. Her “Hullo, dearie,” disturbed
him, and he stumbled in a moment of hesi-
tancy. Farther down the street he passed
a dance-liall and walked slowly for one.
moment's hearing of syncopated shuffling, the
rustling of garments, the laughter of a party
of men and women who were just entering.
He reached a park-skirted section of the
street in which there was little light and less
traffic, and realised that he was being fol-
lowed. Someone was keeping just behind.
He selected a spot under a street-light, and
suddenly turned. The woman who was fol-
lowing came forward, and he knew at once
that she was the author of the vague memo-
ries which had sent, him on his quest of ad-
venture. Without hesitation he said “I
wanted to meet you to-night.”
“You know me?” she asked in some sur-
(prise.
"We live in the same building.”
She gazed at him fixedly. “You are the
gentleman on the front section of the second
floor, the clergyman ?”
“Not a clergyman to-night. I’m off duty.”
He was watching her closely. Her features
were regular, but, unbalanced as he was by
his entirely new experience, he saw that she
was not beautiful. The steady, unwavering
gaze of her eyes, black, slightly prominent,
and uncannily bright, held him in momentary
fascination.
“I wonder,” she said, ‘if you can be
trusted.”
“I don’t know yet, but —I think so,” he
replied.
“I am in great trouble.”
He smothered the instinctive recoil from
such a trite opening to his adventure, and
then remembered that the finder of the Green
Door, with a far more commonplace opening,
went on to the end. “If I can be of any
assistance,” he said at last.
“How far would you go to help me?
Would you turn back half-way?”
“Not to-night. Whatever happens, I will
help you.”
Suddenly pressing a key into his hand, the
woman, still holding him with her eyes, said
without hurry or emotion: “Go back to my
dat. Turn on the light and wait till I re-
turn. I will join you in fifteen minutes
when I have called another friend who must
also help. Be careful no one sees you.”
Before he could question her she was
hurrying across the park. The first impulse
was to throw the key into the roadway and
make for the home of an old classmate, a
wholesome family corner to which he was
always welcomed. And then the room with
the Green Door seemed to take shape from
the other side of the street. With a nervous
laugh he pocketed the key, and was soon
striding back to the little drama. Was it
to be a comedy or a tragedy that the fates
had staged for liis initiation into the world
of human affairs? As he stood outside the
door, watching carefully that none saw him
enter, the Reverend John had a slight prick-
ing of conscience. What had become of that
youthful exaltation of mind and purpose
which his ordination had re-kindled? Was he
already false to the vows so recently made?
Ihen those compelling eyes resumed their
sway. A moment later he was in the room,
with the door re-closed.
The darkness seemed to have actual sub-
stance, and to be pressing in on him, creat-
es a sense of discomfort, almost of pain.
Cowardice had never been one of his weak-
nesses, but a wave of fear swept over him
and left him trembling. With an effort he
regained control of his nerves and found
that the even beating of his heart had been
rudely disturbed, that his breathing was
short and unnatural. liis sensations re-
minded him of physical collapse after over-
exertion on the football field. But at last
his will reasserted itself, and a hand still
trembling felt its way to some button on the
wall. A flood of light struck lum, and hurt
as much as the darkness which it had ban-
ished. He looked fearfully round the room,
taking in the details of arrangement and fur-
nishing with amazing rapidity. It was a
large living room with luxurious but refined
appointments. His eyes were arrested by a
striking picture of Circe, beneath which was
a perfect statue of a Faun.
Then some monstrous shadow seemed to
force its way to the front and blot out all
else in the room. A wave of nausea assailed
him as he stared,, dry-mouthed, at the evil
thing sprawled in disorder on a settee in a
corner—the last corner to come within his
range of vision.
How long he stared or what it was that
loosened the paralysis of limbs and mind to
allow him to come slowly into the middle
of the room he could never remember. The
thing he stared at was the body of a man
in evening clothes. The face wore the grey
mask of death. The eyes, wide open, stared
at the door as if expecting someone to enter.
The hands clutched at the remnants of a
broken fan. The body was strangely twisted,
as though life had been wrenched from it
by violent hands, and a thin trickle of blood
was still oozing from the mouth.
The Reverend John did not, hear the door
open and shut, and was unconscious of the
woman’s entry into the room until her hand
touched his ' arm. Starting violently, he
shrank from her, from it —that evil-looking
shell which had been the habitation of a
man. He turned fiercely on the woman.
“Why, why did you bring me into this?"
he said.
“Hush ! No one must hear us.”
“Everyone must hear, whatever this is—
murder or a judgment of God.”
“Can’t you distinguish between a judg-
ment of God and the Devil collecting his
dues?”
She spoke without any feeling or emotion,
and crossed to the settee to throw a table-
cover over the face. The intensity of her
gaze seemed to increase every moment. Her
face had lost every vestige of color. All
her vitality was for the moment concentrated
in her eyes, and as though hypnotised he
found himself waiting for some command.
Speaking rapidly and without intonation, she
assured him that death had been the result
of a sudden seizure.
“But why,” he asked, “why did you choose
me for—whatever you want?”
Disregarding the interruption she con-
tinued her explanation. She had been his
mistress, lie was a gross, sensual animal
with plenty of money. He drank too much,
and on this particular night had quarrelled
with her. Just when his violence threat-
ened to disturb the inmates of the adjoining
flats, the visitation had come, and “in three
minutes” —waving her hand towards the
couch, and for the first time displaying feel-
ing, not of regret but of disgust—“that’s
what was left of him.”
The Reverend John moved towards the
door. The woman did not try to intercept
him, but, still holding him with her eyes,
said: “You promised you would not turn
back half-way.”
“But what do you want me to do?” he
hsked.
“Take him into your room and say that
he died there —that you knew him.”
“And then?”
“I have sent for his wife to be here. She
cannot be here before ten o’clock. We have
half an hour left.”
“Why should I do this?’
“For his wife’s sake. She believed in
him.”
"Did you never think of her before?”
“You don’t understand. This is a world
you know nothing of.”
“Thank God for that!”
“Yes, yes. Thank your God if you like,
but don’t preach here. Do as I ask.”
“You must tell me more.”
“Haven’t I told you all? His wife be-
lieves in him. The loss of that belief may
bring suffering to her and others. I don’t
believe in anything or anybody. I’m what
you call thoroughly and eternally damned.”
“Then why worry about the other
woman?”
“It’s just a fancy of mine. She is what
you call a good woman. Without much effort
we, you and I—you a servant of your God,
and I an envoy of the Devil—can let her
remain good, with unbroken faith in that
poor beast. Don’t you preach something
about actions being counted unto us as
righteousness? Will you do it?”
And the Reverend John Darley suddenly
remembered that the door of his flat was
painted dark green. His adventure must,
end behind that door. He became a man of
action.
“Watch the passage-way,” he commanded
gruffly.
“I telephoned his wife after meeting you.”
continued the woman, “directed her to your
flat, and told her that her husband had
been taken ill while visiting you. She will
be consoled to think he died in your com-
pany. I also ’phoned a doctor. You will
have to lie a good bit.”
“Tell me when the passage is clear, and
open my door,” he replied, throwing her the
key.
A moment later the* Reverend John witli
his strange load was in! his flat, and the lock
of the Green Door snapped behind him.
Turning on the woman, he ordered her out,
with savage intensity.
The light faded from, lier eyes. She wearily
opened the door again, and, turning, said:
“Will I come back after the others have
gone?”
“Get out of this, and stay out.!”
The woman closed tire door and went
slowly back to her rooms.
Two days later the man who had died,
lamented as an un timely loss to the commer-
cial world, had a wonderful funeral, and his
mourners derived much consolation from the
knowledge that the* occupant of the imposing
hearse had died ’while calling on a clergy-
man.
It was John D ftrley’s only adventure. He
accepted the call to a suburban church, and
is to-jiay, although somewhat severe and
ascetic, a zealous: and popular leader of the
Church.

Help Your Kidneys!
Avoid that wearying backache!
T F THE KIDNEYS are weak, excess uric acid over-
-1 loads the blood. Pains begin to strike across the
small of the back, and rheumatic twinges, headaches,
dizziness and urinary troubles quickly follow. Don t
neglect these warnings! You should strengthen the
kidneys NOW. There is danger of rheumatism,
lumbago, sciatica, gravel or stone. Let Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills help you. Doan s Pills will relieve
your kidney troubles, as surely as earlier treatment would have prevented them.
A MAN’S CASE.
Mr. William Carroll, sen., ex-railway guard, 749 Harris
Street, Pyrmont, Sydney, says:—“Some time ago I strained
myself pushing some heavy trucks, and soon noticed the effect
in the small of my back. For three solid months I was unable
to work, and was laid up. I had a very lame back, and a dull
pain through the loins and kidneys, and my secretions became
unnatural and irregular. I consulted a doctor, who recom-
mended Turkish baths; but, though I got a little ease, I could
not work. I used Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and . obtained
wonderful relief; in fact, so much so that I can now do heavy
work. I am fully convinced that Doan’s Backache Kdiney
Pills are a true Kidney remedy, and I never fail to recommend
them among my friends.”
Twenty years later Mr. Carroll says:—“l am still a
great believer in Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. They cured
me many years ago. and by taking them now and again I keep
in splendid health.”

TROUBLE.
A WOMAN’S CASE.
Mrs. M. Whitbread, sen., “Amherst,” Napoleon Street,
Mascot, Sydney, says:—“For years I suffered terribly from
backache and kidney trouble, and was at times so ill that I had
to lie up for days. My back ached terribly, and I was almost
crippled with the ailment, every movement making the pain
worse. My ankles and legs swelled considerably, and I knew
this was a sign of dropsy. I also had trouble with the secre-
tions, was subject to dizziness, and felt tired and languid. I
was really far from well, and having seen Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills advertised at different times, it at last occurred to
me to' try this remedy. I got some, and lr proved a blessing,
giving quick relief, and gradually effected a perfect cure. I feel
splendid now, and have only Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills to
thank for my wonderful recovery."
Two years later Mrs. Whitbread says:—“My cure has
proved a permanent one, no sign of kidney trouble having
returned since Doan’s Pills cured me over two years ago.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MRS. O'GRADY stood behind the drawn
curtains of the sitting-room window
waiting for the postman. From far
down the road his whistle sounded in stac-
cato calls which echoed in her hungry breast.
Yesterday he had passed, and the day before,
and the day before that; and she knew he
would pass to-day also. It was the dread of
that certainty and her determination not to
allow the neighbors to see her disappointed
eagerness which kept her trembling at the
window instead of craning over the gate as
Hilda Williamson was doing across the
street. It was Hilda’s derisive eyes that
Mrs. O’Grady sheltered from particularly,
and a pulse began to beat in her brain as she
watched through the curtains the girl smil-
ing in satistied anticipation. The white
column of Hilda’s throat above her swelling
blouse, her bold face and the gleaming arro-
gance of her hair made Mrs. O’Grady, so
thin and .yellow, grow cold with hate and
anguish.
The shrill blasts of the whistle sounded
nearer. Mrs. O’Grady stood very still. Out-
side the morning sunlight flooded the narrow,
dusty street and gilded the mean houses.
Hilda stretched herself in lazy grace and
called a greeting to a passer-by.
The postman whistled next door, and Mrs.
O’Grady’s heart stopped. He was coming—
he had passed—he was crossing the road.
Hilda’s voice and laugh, loud and exultant,
brought back the room and the pain in her
breast to Mrs. O’Grady.
“Hello, postman !” ?
“Here you are, dear, another one to-day.”
The postman had the freedom of old
acquaintance. Hilda took her letter and
smiled archly, inclined to gossip. But the
postman had a time-table to keep, and passed
on, disregarding the invitation. “That’s her
all over,” thought Mrs. O’Grady, “making
herself cheap with any man who will cast
a look at her.” And that Joe, her boy, should
leave home and forget his mother while writ-
ing three and. four times a week to that —
that —brazen-faced hussy ! She watched the
girl tear the letter open, and knew from the
glance of triumph thrown across the street
that it was from Joe.
Mrs. O’Grady turned back to the kitchen.
She felt queer in the head. What with one
thing and another, the breakfast things were
not yet washed, and she set herself to this
task after a drop of tea from the strong pot
on the stove. Afterwards she would have
to do her shopping and hold her head high
as she walked up the street, perhaps to meet
one of the Williamsons at the grocer’s or the
butcher’s, and endure her stares. Then
there would be the old man’s shirts and two
of Mary’s dresses to iron—a long task, for
Mary was finicky, like all the young girls
nowadays. But she' was a good girl, thank
God ; not like that Williamson vixen. Mrs.
O’Grady searched for words hard enough for
the one who had come between her and her
boy. She tried to think that Joe would have
been a good boy but for that girl; a little
thoughtless and headstrong, perhaps, ana in-
clined to be wild, but all right at heart. She
would never believe anything ill of Joe.
It was hard to watch the children when
they grew up; and what could she do if
Joe was out of his bed night after night
until twelve and sometimes not in it then?
Young lads were like that; and the old man
was hard on him. It seemed almost as
though he was jealous of the boy. She had
had to stand between him and his father ana
keep his doings secret, else the old man would
have put him out of the house long ago. And
him with no trade, and drifting about from
job to job, and coming to her for a few shil-
lings now and a few shillings again !
The Williamsons were at the bottom of
it all, with a tribe of daughters and an open
house to the whole neighborhood for dancing
and devilment. A bad lot. No wonder the
old man was angry when he found out how
things were going, but lie shouldn't have
turned the lad out, even if he had come home
iii. drink more than once.
And now Joe had been gone nearly a
month and not a word home, although the
Williamsons were telling people that lie had
got a job in the country somewhere and was
going to marry Hilda.
“Any word from Joe?” asked the old man
that night at dinner. Mrs. O’Grady knew
he was worried at the outcome of his stern-
ness, but she had not expected this direct
admission of his uneasiness.
“No.” said Mrs. O’Grady.
“Is lie writing to that slut over the road?”
demanded O’Grady fiercely.
“I—I —don’t know,” said his wife.
“You know well he is, Mother,” said Mary,
with impatience in her voice. “The whole
neighborhood knows it. What is the use of
shielding the lazy good-for-nothing? Let
him keep to the Williamsons and marry
Hilda. It’s a good job we’re rid of him.”
“How dare you speak of your brother like
that. Mary?” cried her mother indignantly.
“You with your education and your lady’s
position in an office.”
“He doesn't work as hard as I do, and
never did,” said Mary. “And he might be
in an office, too, if he wasn't too lazy and
too fond of hanging about hotel corners.”
The storm cleared away and left the family
silent. O’Grady glowered and meditated be-
tween bites. Mrs. O’Grady sighed. Usually
she acted as peacemaker between Joe and
his father or Joe and Mary, for an argu-
ment or a quarrel was part of every meal.
To have O’Grady rebuking her was an indi-
cation of the tragedy that had come to her.
She had lost her boy.
At the meal’s end O’Grady .came out of
his cloud.
“Hear me now,” he said. “Never men-
tion that lad’s name again in this house until
he changes his ways. And if,” he continued
slowly—“and if he marries into that hell-
broth opposite, then he’s no more a son of
mine.”
The weeks passed and brought no change
except that gradually Mrs. O’Grady wearied
of her daily vigil, and only occasionally,
when the intensity of her anguish brought
the revulsion of hope, trembled behind the
curtains to watch the postman pass or linger
for a moment at the Williamsons’ gate. So
it was that she was unaware that Hilda, too,
had learned to know the pain of disappoint-
ment. Often the girl waited in vain and
laughed shrilly when the postman warned
her that men were fickle, or promised to bring
her a letter the next day, even if he had to
write it himself.
O’Grady never mentioned his son; and
Mary, secretly pleased that her rather dis-
reputable brother had gone, renewed old rea-
sons why they should move to a more select
locality. Her father put her off with half-
promises, but Mary knew that the real oppo-
sition to a change came from her mother,
who professed indifference whenever the sub-
ject was mentioned. Mrs. O’Grady dreaded
the idea of leaving the house where her child-
ren had been reared, although the neighbor-
hood had become distasteful to her. To go,
she felt, would be to lose her son forever,
and a capitulation to those who had stolen
him. Her instincts were against a change,
and were too strong for her to take any
initiative in the matter, but her reason told
her that to live in the constraint of the past
months was impossible.
The shadow of Joe’s defection hung above
the family like a pall. Save Mary upon her
pet subject, there was little talk now at
meals or at any other time, excepting when
necessity demanded it or the burden of
silence became so heavy that a few props
of trivial words were needed to support it.
The neighbors had forgotten Joe, but both
O'Grady and his wife felt that they had
been disgraced, and without admitting it
to one another they avoided the occasion of
contact with their friends. Mrs. O’Grady
did her shopping early, and gossiped as little
as possible with the woman next door.
O'Grady neglected his lodge and his Labor
League on the plea that lie was too tired
at night to go out. Even Mary, who despised
the people amongst whom she lived, became
nervous and furtive. She was obsessed with
the idea of leaving this bedraggled suburb
which had surrendered whatever charm it
once possessed to factories and mean indus-
tries. She gave her father little peace, and
made him more morose than ever. In
desperation he took her now and again to
picture-shows. “She can’t jaw at me there,”
lie said to himself, “without being* put out.
But Mrs. O’Grady bided at home.
There came a night when Mrs. O’Grady,
mournful and alone in the house, sat in the
kitchen thinking the vain thoughts she had
gone over again and again. The timid knock-
ing at the front door had to take the. courage
to become loud before she heard it. She
went slowly down the long hall and opened
the door cautiously. A woman stood on the
dark verandah.
“Is that you, Airs. O’Grady?” she asked in
a whisper.
“It is,” said Mrs. O’Grady, peering to
see who it was. The gloom defeated her,
and as the woman sobbed Airs. O’Grady
threw the door wide so that the dim light
from within fell upon the visitor.
It was Hilda Williamson, her face dis-
figured by ;i nervous grimace of propitiation
and her eyes timid for all their unwinking
stare.
Mrs. O Grady, startled out of her impas-
sivity, put a hand to the wall for support
and made to close the door. But the girl
leant into the doorway and seized Mrs.
O'Grady’s wrist.
“Oh, don't, don’t, Mrs. O’Grady; for God’s
sake, don’t turn me away. Tell me what’s
happened to Joe.”
“.Toe!’ said Mrs. O’Grady with a sharp
intake of breath.
"Oh, Mrs. O'Grady,” cried the girl, with
her hand like an icy vice on the arm which
Mrs. O Grady sought to wrest from her,
“won’t you forgive me and be friendly? I've
done you no harm.”
“Harm enough!” said Mrs. O’Grady
grimly. "What have you to tell me about
Joe?"
“He’s gone, Mrs. O’Grady.”
“Gone! What do you mean, gone?” whis-
pered Mrs. O’Grady. The horror of some
last calamity made her numb.
“He’s left me, Mrs. O’Grady. He hasn’t
written to me for a month ; and I must find
him. Oh, I must! I must! Tell me where
he’s gone. You must tell me !”
“Why must I tell you?” asked Mrs.
O’Grady.
The girl shuddered at her tone.
“Oh, I can't! say it, Mrs. O’Grady, I can’t
say it. but I must find Joe. Surely you
wouldn’t let him desert me now?”
“It's a pity he ever saw you,” said Mrs.
O’Grady. “Why couldn’t you leave him
alone?”
“Oh, I shall die of shame!” wailed the
girl. “I must find him. Tell me where he
is.”
Mrs. O’Grady looked at her with a new
interest. “You’re going to have a child?”
she asked.
The girl nodded and fell to weeping.
The warm blood flowed again in the veins
of Mrs. O’Grady and gave her strength. She
wrenched her arm from the girl’s detaining
grasp and shut the door in her face. “The
dirty hussy,” she said to herself. “How dare
she blame Joe?”
When the old man and Mary came home
they found the old woman waiting up for
them and a supper set. They ate a little
and drank tea, and Mary wondered at the
change in her mother. There was a new
light in her eyes, and she wanted to know
all about the pictures and to gossip at large.
After a time she said quietly:—
“Hilda Williamson was here to-night.”
“What?” cried the old man.
“Mother!” said Mary breathlessly.
“Joe’s broken with her. and she doesn’t
know where he is. And she’s going to have
a baby,” went on the old woman in the same
quiet tone.
“Oh, mother,” cried Mary, “we must leave
now.”
“Leave?” said Mrs. O’Grady on a rising
note. “Why should we leave? And that
luissy in disgrace! I wouldn’t leave here
now if it was to live in the king’s palace
with the queen for maid !”
