FACTS!
The only type of
circulation that
lias real worth is that which is constant and
embodies the confidence of readers. These
attributes are possessed only by the daily
newspapers whose circulations are derived, not
by contests, insurance schemes, or high pres-
sure methods, but by real merit. They are
bought because people want them in their
homes.
The daily newspaper
is so essential
to the New Zealander that even in times of
economic stress he continues to buy his
morning daily, so valuable is it for the
information it gives, both in its news and
advertisement columns.
Newspaper advertising is the most economical,
effective and forcible medium for reaching
the New Zealand public.

The Red Page
HIS BOOKS
For Ever Juvenile
Chapman and Hall recently publisher
Red Rags, a 6s. volume of essays b
Oxonians. The title refers, not t
Communism, but to the essayists’ per
sonal dislikes, such as Orthodoxy, Buch
manites and Garden Cities. Howeve
there is an odd affinity between man
of the writers and the young Commun
ists who figure in recent books about th
U.S.S.R. The same self-satisfied belie
that they are supremely important per
sons, the chosen ones of a chosen era
the same contempt for pre-war form
and ideas ; the same unconscious plagiar
isms of pre-war forms and ideas ; th
same humorlessness.
The chief difference is that while th
Communists resemble the smug Sunday
school teachers and pupils of Queen Vic
toria’s reign, the Oxonians ape the intel
lectual “bloods” of the same period. Max
Beerbohm is the favorite model. The
young Master’s bibliography was con
sidered deliciously t daring 35 years ago
and Shamus Frazer, of New, is waggish
on the same lines in this volume. We
see the deep-thinker unbending, reveal
ing himself as a scamp.
Hobbies: Toy soldiers and fairy tales.
Pastimes: Contemplating theft from
museums.
Recreations: Using nautical terms on the
upper decks of omnibuses.
He is as wickedly paradoxical about
cricket as Max was about the fire which
was ruined by unassthetic firemen ; yet
if you told him that he and most of his
friends were pre-war they would resent
it.
Still Holy Russia
Just as clever young Oxford men are
still flippant, superior and ponderously
funny at the expense of their seniors—
as clever young Oxford men have been
for five or six centuries —so earnest
young Russians are still concerned about
their souls, the souls of others, and spiri-
tual siatters generally. Leninism hasn’t
made them atheists ; it has merely given
them another God, changed the State
religion for a religion of the State. Inci-
dentally, it seems to have wished on to
the world the most abominable collec-
tion of prigs since Cromwell’s day.
The theme of The Great Offensive, by
Maurice Hindus (Gollancz: Dymocks;
5s.), is the part which those who have
grown up under Communism are play-
ing in the U.S.S.R. They are as satis-
fied that there is no case for capitalism
as, say, a prohibitionist preacher is that
there is no case for beer. A widow com-
plained that her sick husband had died
because she could get nothing for him
but bread made from the wastes in flour
mills.
“It is the only kind we had for weeks,” in-
terposed a haggard old woman who was stand-
ing by with her rough hands folded over her
stomach.
“And so my husband died,” continued the
widow.
“Stop, mother!" cried one of her daughters.
But the old lady refused to stop, and
the daughter fled in despair. As a rule
the children take sterner steps. In 1928
some engineers were tried for sabotage.
The son of one of them wrote to the
press denouncing his father, and “de-
manding for him the highest measure of
social defence —death by shooting.”
Recently in a village in the Urals two
youths, one aged nine and the other thirteen,
denounced their father, who was chairman of
the local Soviet, as a friend and abettor of
koolacks.
A girl, on being asked if she meant to
have children when she married, re-
turned this immortal reply: —
“A bourzhui woman might refuse to bear
children on account of her figure, but Com-
munists were different. They would not deny
themselves the fulfilment of a biological func-
tion which both Nature and the new society
demanded of them.”
Some school-children were discussing
Pushkin’s character, Tatyana. “She was
a slave of her class,” said a youth of
16. “To-day we
would have to re-
make her, exile
her, compel her
to become a mass
worker.” Another
pupil agreed, and
then came Guryeva, the heretic.
“She was not to blame for her ideology. She
meant well, and she was noble, and, even though
you may think me stupid and perverted, '
want to say that 1 like her, and I cried when
1 read of her misfortunes,”
Her hearers were scandalised, and she
was sanctimoniously berated by a boy
as “a clear example of how difficult it
is for some persons to slough off their
bourgeois heritage.” There is a Com-
munist jargon as definite as the jargon
of the baser kind of art critic, and all
these young people have it off pat.
Oktobrionoks
Children also figure prominently in
Ella Winter’s Red Virtue (Gollancz;
Dymocks ; 5s.); and, like Mr. Hindus,
Ella is a Bolshevik sympathiser. Wher-
ever the young are gathered together the
song of the Oktobrionoks (Communists
of from two to nine) is heard.
We are joyful children.
Our name is Oktobrionoks.
We do not like mere surface words.
Be ready. We are always ready.
The Oktobrionoks are revealed as per-
haps the most eminently smackable
youngsters in all Russia—-a big order.
When a girl of seven was told that she
was too young to have a political car-
toon explained to her, she countered
with “There is no ‘too young.’ A child
can understand anything if you will only
explain it in terms a child can under-
stand.” These pestiferous little epigram-
mongers spend a vast amount of time
provoking their elders. A six-year-old
boy pointed to the family ikons and said :
“Mother, it is really time you did away
with these things.” A girl cross-ques-
tioned Miss Winter about the negroes of
America. “Why, why are they discrimi-
nated against? Please explain it to me.
You Americans are human beings, as
we are. Are your black human beings
not human also?”
There is one direction in which the
parents seem to be getting back on their
young to some purpose. Babies, it
appears, are often given such names as
Five-year Plan, Dialectics of Material-
ism and Red Trade Union International.
It is evident that the U.S.S.R. is being
organised from the infants’ schools up
on the .lines of a gigantic revivalist meet-
ing, with hard work as a substitute for
one of those masochistic religions which
are such paying propositions in the
U.S.A. Every movement of the sort
begins in a white heat of fervor and
cools down with the appearance of
ecclesiasticism, scandals and criticism.
Yet it may be that Communism will oust
Christianity in Russia as Christianity
ousted Paganism in Italy, It seems likely
also to deprive the Russians of the entire
body of Western culture. The themes
which have inspired the greatest poems,
paintings, plays and novels —national
patriotism, family love, religious ideals,
the pageantries of life—are classed as
superstitions, and writings on such sub-
jects have been placed on a Soviet index
as what we would call blasphemous pub-
lications.
RED PAGE.
The Roman Democracy
An Italian exile in Geneva, Guglielmo
Ferrero calls his History of Julius
Ccesar (Allen and Unwin ; 165.) “an anti-
fascist history.” Yet it isn’t pro-demo-
cratic. No honest study of the period
could be.
Consider the century that preceded the
rise of the Roman Empire in terms of
our own era. When Caesar was a youth
the first Bolshevist-International move-
ment began under Mithridates. Rome
had been through a social revolution,
with the usual massacres and robberies!
and, as usual, the poor had been the
sufferers. Mithridates presented himself
as the avenger of a downtrodden prole-
tariat. The Senate realised that Rome
was facing “not a mere struggle between
an Eastern and a Western Power, but
an organised and widespread revolution

—this is White Horse
A blindfolded test may be a matter for experts, but there
are so many qualities that make White Horse the preferred
Whisky that its devotees cannot fail to recognise it.
Connoisseurs pronounce it the equal of a fine liqueur. Its
aroma of peat and heather, as well as the circular seal,
“Product of Scotland,” affixed on the neck of every bottle,
by authority of His Majesty’s Customs, tell you that it’s
real old Scotch.

WHAT I DISCOVERED
ABOUT HAIR
IT does not matter if your hair is fall-
ing out, if you are fast going bald —
or what you have tried. I know you
have not used the RIGHT method! My
own hair fell out in handfuls until I
fast began to go bald. I tried every-
thing. But now I have a thick, lustrous
growth of hair—thanks to the important
discovery that —
TONICS WILL NEVER
CROW HAIR
THEY never have—because it is im-
possible! There is one underlying
principle that stimulates New Hair
Growth —that principle is involved in
the new Kelso Murchison Treatment.
It’s a new way—entirely different, and
successful. It approaches baldness, fall-
ing hair, etc., from a new angle. With
it you can stop your hair troubles over-
night ! Don’t waste more time and
money on worthless “tonics” and “hair
restorers,” but accept my free offer and
watch your hair grow ! Get this special
offer coupon in the post to-day!

IT DOES NOT MATTER
IT does not matter how long-
standing your hair or scalp
trouble may be, it does not matter
what you have tried —J. Kelso

to you beyond all doubt, and
without your risking one penny,
that YOU CAN DEFINITELY
GROW NEW HAlR—if you send

STILL MORE PROOF —

“It has completely changed the
colour of my hair. It has turned
it from its dry, dead straw-look-
ing colour back to its original
shade of brown, and now,
after about three weeks’ use, I
have a lot of new hair growing all
over my head. It’s growing like
wildfire. I might mention that I
never gave your treatment a very
fair go either.”—C. J. Reynolds,
M., N.Z.
“After using your course for one
week, my hair stopped falling and
began to improve wonderfully.
To-day my hair is as healthy as
it is possible to be, and the thin
parts are almost as abundant with
hair as the rest of my head.” —

against plutocracy.” Sulla was given
command of the Roman forces. He was
more successful than Europe’s “White
generals were against the U.S.S.R., and
Lucullus completed his work.
In Australia successful politicians have
to be successful borrowers; under the
Roman Republic they had to be success-
ful generals. What could Cicero not have
done with courage, lack of principle and
an army? Inside half a century Sulla,
Crassus, Lucullus, Pompey and Qesar
stole in Asia and elsewhere, and spent
on the electors of Rome, far more than
the £1,187,827,868 which our politicians
have borrowed abroad, and spent here,
in about the same time.
Martial qualities apart, Rome’s demo-
cratic leaders were very like ours. The
910,000 electors of the city and provinces
consisted chiefly of small shopkeepers,
artisans, civil servants (a fluctuating
band ; there was no permanent civil ser-
vice in Republican Rome) and unem-
ployed ; and they were organised into
“colleges,” or, as we would say, unions.
How this account of Caesar’s activities
matches a day in the life of any ambi-
tious politician of our time!
Cassar began by serving a sedulous appren-
ticeship in that forced labor of adulation to
which all Roman politicians of that day were
condemned. He rose at dawn to receive any
busybody who cared to call.... He then went
down into the Forum to plead causes, or to
have a word with a magistrate or senator or
banker in the interests of some unfortunate
client.... He allowed himself to be stopped in
the street by any worthy citizen who chose to
claim his acquaintance He kept a pleasan-
try or a compliment or a promise ready on his
lips for all-comers, put in an appearance at
the marriages, funerals and family festivals
of all classes of citizens, worked in support
of some candidate at every election... .and had
dependents who served as his agents during
elections, as a claque, and as cut-throats in
any personal quarrel.
The vote, which had been fought for
so desperately by a previous generation,
was despised. The upper and upper-
middle classes preferred money-making
to politics, and power was tending more
and more to gravitate into the hands of
a few bosses. By the time Caesar arrived
as leader of the party of discontent
democracy had become utterly dis-
credited. The Triumvirate (Caesar,
Pompey, Crassus) constituted the first
Caucus or inner group. How, asks the
historian, could the chiefs of a party
which was detested by those in posses-
sion of wealth and culture continue to be
supreme in a free Republic with elective
institutions?
There was no longer at Rome, as of old, a
disciplined and homogeneous body of citizens
ready to undertake the responsibility of gov-
ernment. All were too much engaged at home,
too selfish, too unsympathetic to one another
to work harmoniously in the interests of all.
The annexation of Gaul is one of the
landmarks of universal history—Euro-
pean history begins with it —but it was
inspired by sordid party motives. The
Treasury was empty ; Crassus and Pom-
pey were quarrelling; the Workmen’s
Associations and Electoral Societies were
clamoring for more and more State aid ;
so were the Senators, who had already
been placated, to the annoyance of the
taxpayers, with “legationes liberae” —the
equivalent of our gold passes. Caesar’s
victories in Gaul solved his immediate
political problems, and they left him with
an incomparable army.
His assumption of the Dictatorship in
48 B.c. followed inevitably. He did forth-
with what every revolutionary has done
on achieving supreme power—turned
conservative. To the relief of the capi-
talistic classes, one of his first actions
before leaving to close his account with
Pompey at Pharsalia was to remove
Novce Tcibulce, or debt abolition, from
his platform. The death of Pompey left
him master of the Roman world, yet
difficulties still faced him —the eternal
difficulties of finance —and he was pre-
paring to solve them in the only way
he knew —by invading Parthia —when the
Ides of March came.
The biographer sees Caesar as another
Mussolini. To others he seems more
like Stalin —in his disregard for human
life, in his vandal destructiveness, in his
habit of improvising policies, and in his
gift for capitalising discontent. His sys-
tem never really worked, and his death
paved the way for an Imperial tyranny.
Sovietism doesn’t appear to be working,
and it seems likelier to end in a revolu-
tion of violence than Mussolini’s bour-
geois tyranny.
J.D.
Eton, Oxford and Moscow
John Strachey’s The Coming Struggle
for Power (Victor Gollancz; 12s. 6d.)
is a jeering, cleverly-analytical valedic-
tory to the capitalistic system, which, inas-
much as he is a product of Eton and
Oxford, is to blame for Mr. Strachey.
The world, as he sees it, is dominated
nationally by greed and internationally
by a British-ridden group of Powers
which regard war on defenceless Russia
as the only possible method of salvation
for capitalism.
The first chapters form a sort of sub-
conscious summary of the author’s wide
reading of Marxist philosophy, salted
with denunciations of British economists,
British modes of living, Britain’s reli-
gions, literature, art, industrial system,
Jimmy Thomas and the Labor party,
from which the author parted company
in 1931. All phases are viewed from a
class angle. English poets, for instance, as
a section, seem preferable to English prose
writers because they were mainly radical,
but individually Shelley and Keats do not
shine so brightly as T. S. Eliot, because
that genius, though now apostate, seems
to have shown true fraternal principles
in his earlier day. “The Waste Land,
it appears, will “always remain supremely
dear to Londoners” because of a mys-
terious flavor of brotherhood in passages
like this:
Goonight, Bill. Goonight, Lou. Goonight,
May. Goonight.
Ta-ta. Goonight. Goonight.
Good night, ladies. Good night, sweet
ladies. Good night, good night.
Aldous Huxley is tolerable because,
though he is capitalist to the core,
he is “consciously describing the close
of the rich man’s epoch,” and his findings
about our present system of society are
always the same:
Go where you like, do what you will, you
will never escape from the smell of ordure
and decay.
D. H. Lawrence is par excellence the
British author of his time “because he
is by origin a worker, the son of a Not-
tinghamshire miner; a man from the
very heart of England.” He is as typical
an Englishman as T. E. Lawrence—
which is quite likely, seeing that Feisul’s
friend is a Welshman of Hibernian an-
cestry ; and no one will dispute, either,
that Keats is as typical an Englishman
as the Duke of Wellington, who was an
Irishman out and out. However, none
of these people or the things they write
about will matter much longer, except
as dry history, because, in self-defence,
dying religion and science and the hunger-
ing millions are going to have their way
and Eton and Magdalen and St. Leonards
Terrace, S.W., where Mr. Strachey has
his comfortable dwelling, are bound
shortly for limbo.
To the end of the purely critical and
elucidatory chapters, the book is enter-
taining and provocative. But when Mr.
Strachey assumes the role of prophet and
begins to limn the Communist future,
one senses a strong flavor of the babuism
which knows but does not comprehend.
What truck can one trained in English
integrity have with a system whose arch-
priest advises his disciples to abhor con-
sistency and “to practise trickery and
adroitness”? And how can a mind
brought up on Plato and Jevons walk
hand in hand with an ideal which aims
at a “classless society” and, at the same
time, preach that the first step towards
the goal is to hand over existing society
to the mercy of a dictatorship manned
by the most strenuous class-haters in
the most class-conscious section of the
community?
M.E.
In Darkest Tasmania
The theme of Bernard Cronin’s The
Sow's Ear (Endeavour Press; 65.) is
whispered in the title, delicately pro-
claimed through the person of June
Windsor in the first few pages, and
trumpeted with the arrival of the school-
master, Brian Forbes, at Valley Point,
a remote corner of Tasmania. Brian
is confronted with the life and sex forces
which are rampant among a people who
have been cut off from all civilising in-
fluences except those offered by religion.
He is employed largely by his creator to
mirror these emotions and their results.
The author’s weakness is a tendency
to melodramatise his situations. The re-
turn of the runaway Mary Flack when
close to her time, her seizure in church,
and the reactions of her mother and
June and the community are theatrical
enough ; the scene in the school, where
June’s fanatical father, with the bucolic
fiance in tow, accuses Brian of seduction,
is almost ludicrous. “Leave this build-
ing,” says Brian, “and his burning look
checked Edgar Bree more effectively than
a blow.” What with one thing and an-
other I was not sorry to see the last of
Brian, and to settle down to the last sec-
tion, which has a definite appeal.
As an exposer of Government swind-
ling Cronin is on sure ground. The
heroic struggles and defeat of the
Brees by the natural forces of weed,
bracken, crop-diseases, caterpillars and
fire, against which they had no warning
or means of- insurance, are done with
genuine understanding and poignancy.
E.V. B.
A Satchel of Books
Lady Longford is funny at the expense
of Ireland’s squireens and their expatriate
relations, but she isn’t nearly so charit-
able as G. A. Birmingham or Miss
Somerville. In Mr. Jiggins of Jiggins-
town (Gollancz; 7s. 6d.) she shows the
reactions of an aged eccentric to rela-
tions who are after his money. A thin
theme, and the end is anti-climax, but
the dialogue and characterisation are
brilliant.
Missing, by F. E. Mills Young
(Bodley Head; 7s. 6d.), is a mystery novel
without a mystery. Robert Hastings, who
doesn’t get on with his wife, disappears
and we are introduced to his double, Jim
Smith, who has arrived out of the blue
and married Angela. After that the up-
shot, in racing parlance, is never in
doubt. Miss Young describes middle-
class Londoners well, and her young
women are particularly good.
Round the World to Freedom, by
Major Paul Stoffa (Bodley Head; 7s. 6d.),
is the latest in escape books. The major
was a Hungarian artillery subaltern when
the war began, and the Russians nailed
him almost at once. He reached Eng-
land by way of Siberia, China and the
U.S.A. towards the end of ’l7, and got
home to find his native land ruined but
still cheerful. Not so exciting as most
works of the sort, but the imprint of
truth is on every page.
The Squatters Daughter, by Charles
Melaun (N. S. Wales Bookstall Co.; 25.),
is a novel inspired by the film which
was inspired by the Bailey-Duggan melo-
drama. Joan has exchanged the rounded
periods of the late Victorian stage for
the idiom of a modern flapper, but she
is the same splendidly upright creature
whom we admired in the long ago. Clive
fades out mournfully in the last chapter,
and Joan turns with shining eyes to Jeff.
The style is as up-to-date and easy to
look at as the picture of the 1933 squat-
ter’s lass on the dust-jacket.
Canadien, by Wilfred Bovey (J. M.
Dent; 10s. 6d.), is a paean of praise of
French Canada and its inhabitants, but
it is also a reliable and fairly comprehen-
sive historical study. The point is stressed
more than once that the French-Cana-
dian is neither Briton nor Gaul; he is
himself, and unlike any other national
type. The position of the Church, the
educational advances of recent years,
and the system of government are dealt
with at some length; the progress of
industry and agriculture doesn’t receive
so much attention. There are about 40
excellent reproductions of photographs.
Josef Kastein has packed into the 445
pages of his History of the Jews
(Bodley Head; 155.) every material fact
about his race over a period of 3000
years. Judaism first entered on the cur-
rent of world affairs when its con-
tacts with Greece were made after Alex-
ander’s conquests. What Mr. Kastein
calls “the heroic age” followed, and it
lasted till the fall of Jerusalem. Since
then the strength of the Jew has been
the strength of his spirit. He has been
persecuted in every country under the
sun, but his faith and his ideolo-
gies have survived, and Judea is to-day a
greater world force, numerically, eco-
nomically and spiritually, than at any
time in history. The theme of this master-
piece of compression is well expressed in
a sentence towards the end of the epi-
logue:—•
The West drove the Jews eastwards by means
of bloody persecutions; the East drove them all
over the world by means of massacres unparal-
leled in history, until the great migration to
America and the lesser migration to Palestine
began; the former had for its object the sal-
vation of their bodies, the latter the salvation
of their souls, and the united aim of both was
that the two should one day balance and com-
plete each other.
The Crilly Court Mystery, by Harry
Stephen Keller (Ward, Lock; 3s. 6d.),
is a newspaper-cwm-murder yarn. Kent-
land, the hero, is a bright young reporter
on the Chicago “Sun” when an art-dealer
by the name of Abdul Mazurka is slam.
By exhibiting his pressman’s badge Kent-
land practically gets carte blanche from
the police to take over their job of detect-
ing the assassin, and he makes such a
good fist of it that his boss confers a
managing-editorship on him. He de-
served it. Any managing editor can
order underlings to write up crimes ; but
how many can leave their desks at a
moment’s notice, clear up a complicated
mystery involving a prominent member
of the staff and win the hand of a nice
girl while continuing the routine work
of the office? The writer will be sur-
prised if Mr. Kentland doesn’t spare
time from his new duties to elucidate an-
other mystery before the year is out.

DEALING WITH J. W. BLANK.
There are still about 130,000 unemployed in
N. S. Wales. Those on the dole total 98,000.
—Sydney “Telegraph
James William Blank is a type as well
as an individual. He lives in Woolloo-
mooloo, Sydney, because “it is closer
to the ferry” and cheap. He has a flat
on the second floor of a grimy stone
building which dates from Governor
Denison’s time—two high and dingy
rooms. One of these opens on a sagging
verandah which has been converted into
a kitchenette.
The furniture of the Blank home is
simple. There are a decrepit double bed
covered with the relics of a tornado and
sagging in the middle, a rickety single
bed clothed in a patchwork quilt and a
chaff bag, two broken chairs, some
appurtenances which must not be too
closely investigated lest we discover be-
hind their tattered drapes the petrol
case missing from the grocery yard, three
iron saucepans and a little chipped
crockery.
The one attempt at mural decoration is
a picture called “Kiss Mother,” on which
the flies of half a century have roosted.
On the floor stands a bucket in which
we find J. W. Blank himself easing the
ardors of his swollen feet, while he
gloomily cons over his stock-in-trade.
Mrs. 8., who is present, is nursing some-
thing that looks like a bundle of rags.
It is, in reality, her youngest son.
When we arrive, Mr. Blank is swear-
ing. He is swearing at the householders
of Mosman who will not buy his wares.
He is a muscular person with a tousled
head. His trousers are rolled up to the
top of the overcrowded bucket, from the
interior of which steam rises. His hands
are like dredge grabs ; his legs are hod-
bowed. His countenance wears the ex-
pression of one who scorns thought as a
pastime of women and capitalists. Once
he was a builders’ laborer and took a
pride in his job, as did his wife, who
tells you of the time she got the kids a
holiday to watch him eat his lunch on
an eleventh-storey girder over George-
street.
Since he lost his job three years ago
he has taken to hawking, and —as wit-
ness the state of his feet—he does it
earnestly, as he used to do his laboring.
All the dogs of Mosman and North Syd-
ney know him with his pathetic bag of
laces and chewing-gum and studs —things
nobody would buy except out of charity.
By dint of nine hard hours’ tramping
every day he has earned a large crop of
varicose veins, and he makes enough to
render him just ineligible for the dole,
to keep the urgent landlord at bay and
the s.-p. bookie-grocer at the corner
sadly hopeful. He might be slightly more
solvent than he is if his way were not
through northern Woolloomooloo, where,
as he discovers sometimes as he walks
homeward weary, bitter and ridiculous,
with his featherweight suitcase in his
clumsy fist, there are seven pubs.
Before the depression the Blanks did
not live like this. They had a worker’s
dwelling in south-west Sydney. It was
in the middle of a row of 78 other dwell-
ings, exactly the same size, shape and
price, with a lawn seven feet square in
front, a verandah tiled like a Masonic
temple, the name “Pozieres” under glass
and two mortgages. It was an ideal resi-
dence, with a green suite in the front
room and a very pink enlargement of
Mrs. B.’s mother hung above the fire-
place, in which they kept the aspidistra.
There was, moreover, a colored-bead
screen in the passage and a savings-bank
book in the bottom drawer of the ward-
robe.
Then J.W. lost his job. The savings-bank
book went. The first mortgage fell with
crushing force; the second faded into
thin air. A gentleman who advertised
“loans at the lowest rates” —he charged
40 per cent, plus £1 as compen-
sation for not registering the bill-of-
sale —acquired mother’s picture and the
aspidistra. Bankstown ended ; Woolloo-
mooloo began. There are two more
children now —four in all, but, as J.W.
says, “It’s bad enough to lose your job
without losing your pleasures.” All four
are now being brought up in the lanes.
There are thousands of families more
or less like the Blanks in Australia.
Whether they live by hawking or on
the dole, in the slums or in some ironi-
cally-named Happy Valley or bankrupt
suburb, the difference in their lots is only
a matter of degree. They are the pro-
ducts less of circumstances than of the
stupidity of the politicians. They think,
in the words of Mr. Blank himself, that
the system is “crook,” and that Mr.
Lyons and Mr. Stevens are “crook” with
it. Mr. Lang is their prophet, unless they
have gone further and become the prey
of the Communists. Lang has achieved
his ascendancy because he has shown an
understanding of their out-of-work out-
look. His cry of “humanity before
money,” specious and dishonest as it is,
has enough appeal to make him a Mes-
siah, and to promote the idea that the
“Labor Daily” mortgage and the
Hawkesbury farm are libellous myths
invented by the capitalist liar (“Where’d
he get the money these times?” asks Mr.
Blank reasonably).
Of course, the demagogues would have
us believe that all the Blanks are sin-
cere socialists, and that capitalism is on
the edge of the cliff. But they are not.
They are just Self-Preservationists, like
the rest of us. They don’t want the
millennium ; but they don’t, either, want
the next generation to be a bootless, hun-
gry one, bred in the gutters and good for
nothing except to shout at political meet-
ings and be knocked down by police
when they have been goaded far enough.
What they do want is to get back to
“Pozieres” in Bankstown where they may
enjoy their former content and aspidis-
tras. They would listen just as easily to
Lyons or Stevens as to Lang, if those
gentlemen would look up from their
ledgers and their inter-party wrangles
and begin to think of the national
balance in terms of men and women
instead of in cyphers.
The Bulletin has for most of its days
denounced unproductive borrowing,
which is still going on —Governments
are spending on “works” lumps of loan
money which is being thrown away.
But sometimes every sound business
can afford to borrow, and, indeed,
must borrow if it is to conserve
future profits. We have reached such
a moment in the history of Australia,
Unlimited. We must borrow to finance
deficits, so that we can halve taxation
and put into their proper channels of
work the men who otherwise will help to
give Lang and Co. the right to socialise
us after the next election. “A fully-em-
ployed community” should be the slogan
of 1933, especially now the rise in wool
prices has come.
The hour calls for a statesman, strong
enough to sweep aside the tinkering
book-keepers who are slowly but in-
voluntarily handing over the country to
the wild men, and to shout: “Away with
the theorists and revenue-grabbers! Set
industry free to put the unemployed back
in the jobs they were trained to do—no
more idiotic relief work—and to give
idle youth the opportunity for want of
which it is eating its heart out! Produc-
tive work at award wages for every
decent Australian who wants it! Fifty
per cent, off the revenue duties, the in-
come and relief taxes, the sales tax and
the State land taxes to make it possible!
Total abolition of the Federal land tax
and the N. S. Wales endowment tax!”
That policy would be a far shorter cut
to national well-being than the one now
fashionable with the gentlemen of the
Premiers’ Conference.
ENOUGH OF LYONS!
Australia awoke one morning and
found that a new party leader had been
conferred on it in the person of Mr. Joe
Lyons. The party concerned was not
new, being, in fact, his recent enemies,
the Nationalists, formerly the Liberals,
but it was considered to have given a
tolerable imitation of being new-born—
or, at least, re-born—by taking another
name. Presently, as a result of a revolt
led by General John Beasley, there was
an election, and Mr. Lyons became
Prime Minister. And only two years
before he had entered the Common-
wealth Parliament by capturing a seat
never before won by a Labor member,
and had journeyed to Canberra wonder-
ing whether the luck would hold.
The transformation of Mr. Lyons
from a Labor member into a U.A.P, Prime
Minister originated in a newspaper stunt.
Flapper journalism had been finding
things dull. The beach girls had all gone
home and put on their clothes. No
SOS for a representative Australian
beauty had come from Hollywood for
some months. “Smithy,” that ever-smil-
ing standby of afternoon newspapers,
was temporarily in eclipse. It was neces-
sary to fall back on politics, and politics,
though lacking in sex appeal, had become
intriguing. The Federal Labor party was
tearing itself to pieces. It would obvi-
ously be succeeded by a Nationalist Gov-
ernment. But Latham, the Nationalist
leader, aspired to a judicial career. Bruce,
out of favor with flapper journalism, was
out of Parliament also. Lyons was
vaguely understood to have saved the
country. It would be an excellent stunt
to put Lyons in Latham’s place.
Of course, flapper journalism could
not have brought it off alone, favorable
as the circumstances were. A popular
auxiliary was required, and one presented
itself in the AU-fof-Australia League.
Every now and then N. S. Wales gives
birth to an association of young men
who feel that things political are going
wrong, and that, by combining, they can
put them right. For a few weeks or
months they show amazing enthusiasm
and a really remarkable talent for organ-
isation. To the great profit of one of the
minor secondary industries, they break
out in an eruption of badges. Then,
quite suddenly, as a rule, the enthusiasm
wanes, the badges disappear, and the
members return to the pursuits they had
relinquished, leaving some good-natured
?oul, unshakably faithful to the lost
cause, to satisfy the creditors, or argue
with them, according to the state of his
purse.
Before this fate overtook the All-
for-Australia League, every second young
man in Sydney sported an A.F.A.L.
badge. Emotional youths would shin up
lamp-posts or mount pedestals of bad
statues and harangue the unemployed,
urging them to be up and doing. Not
knowing precisely what they wanted, the
A.F.A. Leaguers were easily persuaded
that they wanted Joe Lyons. Their some-
what incoherent remarks to this effect
were hailed as an irresistible public de-
mand for Joe ; and the rest was easy.
Coalitions involving the surrender of
principles are never satisfactory, nor do
they last. It is always asserted in these
cases that the Labor politician who has
decided to transfer his allegiance will
lead a great body of followers from one
camp into the other; but, whether his
name is Hughes or Holman, Scaddan
or Lyons, he never does. It is soon
found that all his old associates hate or
despise him, and that a lot of his new
companions do not like him ; so in this
matter he becomes more of a liability
than an asset. Mr. Lyons is a mild and
genial politician, and a model of all the
domestic virtues ; but he must have felt his
position keenly when the Labor press be-
gan publishing extracts from old speeches,
particularly one in which he expressed
the fervent hope that he would never live
to hear his offspring reproach him for
having left the grand old Labor party,
as Winterbottom (or somebody) did. He
was unfortunate also in the choice of
some Ministers, and in the secession of
others. Fenton resigned for one reason,
and Hawker for another ; Gullett broke
down, and Massy Greene is giving up
the job before the job gives him up.
In the early days of his disappearing
Ministry, the Prime Minister showed a
dog-like gratitude to Latham and Bruce,
but of leadership he did not exhibit a
trace. Obliged to reduce the expenditure
on old-age pensions, which was taking
the entire yield of income tax at 9s. 6d.
in the £, he did it so tactlessly, and with
so many clumsy amendments of the law,
that the pensioners were baited into hos-
tility ; and they have become easy meat
for the A.L.P. organiser. Mr. Lyons took
no notice of the Westralian secessionists
until their agitation had become danger-
ous. He strove to save the situation by a
hurried visit to the West which was an in-
glorious failure. Then he persuaded him-
self that secession could be scotched by
setting up a Commonwealth Grants Com-
mission, with a critic of Westralia as
chairman and no Westralian on it.
Now, like Hughes in other days, and
with a general election due next year,
he has blundered into a quarrel with
the Nationalists’ old allies of the Coun-
try party. If the quarrel is not composed
his Government may fall this year, and
his party will be routed at the polls. Then
Australia will probably have Lang back
—wilder, more arrogant, and with
greater opportunities of making a fool
of himself and a wreck of the Common-
wealth than ever. Australians hunger
for leadership, and Lang, though he
never stands up to anyone who faces him
firmly, somehow satisfies this craving.
So—without ever descending to Lang’s
level —did Bruce. Lyons does not satisfy
it, and never will.
Come back, Stanley! This Lyons stunt
has lasted long enough!
ANATOMY OF REVOLUTION.
It is difficult to be impressed with
Herr Hitler’s revolution. He may have
invented a new variety, so that analogies
from the past will be no criterion ;
but, generally speaking, revolutions fall
into two categories—religious and poli-
tical. Religious revolutions last much
longer than political revolutions, dog-
mas being ideas which people hold
very passionately and about which there
is always scope for argument. Political
revolutions leave one class dominant,
and opposition can be crushed by paying
the revolutionary army well.
The stage for a revolution appears to
be set when a sufficient number of people
begins to feel that no conceivable Gov-
ernment could be worse than the exist-
ing one. Fundamentally, Governments
exist for the satisfaction of individual
human cravings. Security, new experi-
ence, response and recognition are the
four instinctive urges common to all
organisms, even the lowest. A society
is reasonably stable when all these four
cravings are more or less satisfied as far
as the majority are concerned, the minor-
ity being kept in subjection by fear of
the law, or through conventional senti-
ments of loyalty and patriotism.
When a revolution is brewing it starts
throwing up slogans: Liberty, Equality,
Fraternity; Dictatorship of the Prole-
tariat, and so forth. Slogans separate
people into parties and prevent them
communicating with one another, so that
it becomes impossible to achieve any sort
of compromise.
The first outbreak leaves the moderates
in control, as in the case of the Kerensky
Government in Russia. Moderates and
radicals usually unite to persecute the
aristocrats, who flee over the frontier and
proceed to make war on their own coun-
try with the aid of interested foreign
Governments. If they are kept at bay by
a temporarily united country there is a
shoit oeried of optimism. This is suc-
ceeded by an uprising of the extremists
when it is discovered that the millennium
has failed to put in an appearance.
When the extremists assume control
the country is full of doubt and confu-
sion. Nobody knows what to do, and,
unless the foreign enemy continues to
threaten, the nation is in danger of fall-
ing into disintegration. To prevent a
civil war the extremists deliberately stage
a Reign of Terror. This gives the people
an outlet for their emotions and para-
lyses the opposition with fright. The
extremists justify their action by claim-
ing that for every head, innocent or
guilty, rolled into the sawdust, a hun-
dred would have perished if civil
war had developed. The Terror is
brought to an end when fear of counter-
revolution and foreign aggression is re-
moved and the people’s emotions become
exhausted. It is never ended by the ex-
tremists being supplanted by the moder-
ates.
The new Government now being firmly
in the saddle and the relics of the old
bureaucracy having been terrorised into
acquiescence, the phenomenon is pre-
sented of erstwhile bloodthirsty lunatics
turning themselves into prosaic politi-
cians concerned with the usual domestic
problems of government. The French
Revolution took a different course be-
cause Napoleon happened to be the
greatest general in history at the head of
a nation with a thirst for glory. The
Japanese revolution was another excep-
tion, being the only scientifically-planned
one in history which has achieved the
aims it set out with. The Russian revo-
lution is also scientifically planned, but
the experiment is not yet completed,
and the original hypothesis may be faulty.
The Hitler revolution seems to be an-
other exception. It is not a religious
revolution, though there has been a sac-
rifice of Jews. Pogroms are a device, not
of revolutionary Governments, but of con-
servative Governments such as that of
Spain in 1391, when 200,000 Jews were
baptised and as many more massacred.
No foreign Government has obliged Herr
Hitler by invading his frontiers. The
aristocrats are not fleeing abroad ; they
are furbishing up their armorial bear-
ings. Nor have the peasants seized the
land.
The orator in the brown shirt is not
in a position to emulate Napoleon by
carving out a new empire for himself in
Europe or elsewhere, so he is invading
the ether with sabre-rattling speeches and
demands for colonies.
The four instinctive urges have been
denied expression in Germany ever since
the Armistice, except to the Nazis, who
admittedly have had great fun. There is
no indication that they are likely to be
satisfied in the immediate future. In
short, nothing has been changed except
the Government.
Nobody need envy Herr Hitler.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The High Cost of Export.
Growers of Australian produce would
wonder less why it costs 4s. 2d. to send
a case of apples to London if they
studied shipping taxation, which seems
designed to prevent shipping companies
existing or anything being exported pay-
ably at all.
Firstly, every overseas vessel carries
a charge of 9d. per net register ton for
lighthouse upkeep—say, £375 on a
10,000-ton vessel. Then,-on ships’ stores
valued at £lBO, there is customs duty,
primage included, of £BB, plus sales tax
at 6 per cent., £l9 ss. lid. —a total of
£lO7 ss. lid. Furthermore, on this basis
also, 6 per cent, sales tax is payable on
all fuel oil or coal (not bunkered within
the Commonwealth) used in ports or
within the three-mile limit, together with
4 per cent, primage on oil and coal used
in Australian waters.
Then the States take a hand. West-
ralia is probably the worst example.
Let it put into Fremantle, and this is
what a vessel helping to sell Australia’s
produce overseas pays (in addition to
charges at the London end, Federal taxes
as above and 10s. per ton per voyage,
Suez Canal dues and European taxes):
Charges under Financial Emergency Act,
1932, 5 p.c. on outward earnings at 4fd. in
the £.
Plus ordinary State tax, 5 p.c. on outward
earnings at Is. 3d. in the £, plus 15 p.c.
Plus Fremantle sea pilotage, £25 4s.—that is
to bring the vessel from inside Rottnest to the
Mole.
Pilotage in and out of harbor. This is charged
as State tonnage dues, Id. or 2d. per ton gross,
according to circumstances, for use of Wood-
man’s Point light as a lead.
Fremantle berthing dues, based on gross
tonnage, plus 20 p.c. surtax. It costs the
Strathnaver £ll2 14s. Bd. to lie alongside Fre-
mantle wharf for 24 hours.
Of course, if a ship goes to Bunbury or
Geraldton the load is added to, and if
any overseas skipper buys N. S. Wales
coal in Westralia he pays 455. lOd. per
ton for it, hoisted to ship’s rail only.
It can be better imagined than de-
scribed what the costs are to a ship
which calls at six ports to pick up Aus-
tralian produce. Yet we Australians
send trade-development ships to Asia,
advertising experts to London and Com-
missioners everywhere. And we wonder
why Australian industry, on which,
of course, all these charges fall in the
long run, in addition to internal taxa-
tion,. cannot prosper and employ more
labor.

Anonymous Government.
The success of a charitable organisation
known as the Smith Family, which oper-
ates in Sydney on principles widely dif-
ferent from those governing the doings
of gilded charity-mongers who infest our
big cities, gives rise to some thoughts
about the propaganda of politics.
The Smith Family has a modest staff
of three. For the rest, its 2000 anony-
mous members feed the hungry, cheer
the sick and the old, give thousands of
Christmas and birthday presents, and,
best of all, treat hundreds of malnour-
ished children, virtually without overhead
expense and without giving any indivi-
dual member a chance to get his name
into the paper.
Such a system might be extended with
advantage to other walks of life. Car-
toonists might become poorer and leader-
writers shorter of material if every Lyons
and Lang became a member of the Jones
Family on election and the Jones Family
had to survive solely by reason of its
kind political deeds and its anonymous
services. Fewer foundation-stones would
be laid, of course, but public opinion of
politicians would be higher.
Perhaps it is an idle dream. But why
shouldn’t the management of the State,
once the managers are chosen, be as pri-
vate as that of well-managed charity or
business? Dalgety and Co. is an effi-
ciently-managed firm ; so is the Union
Bank. How many of us who can
rattle off the names of Lyons and Stevens
Cabinets can name one member of the
board of directors of either, even though
some of us do business with them?
♦
A Swiss Navy.
From a man who was in a real navy:
After a prolonged silence the oracle has
spoken. Australia is to have a Swiss navy
and a Portuguese army. If the present agita-
tion is continued it may even get a battalion of
horse marines.
With . ships that can’t fight, coastal-defence
batteries that have no aircraft to report where
the shots go, a munition factory or two and a
dearth of trained men to use their products, we
shall definitely join the select band of countries
that maintain naval and military forces for show
purposes only.
Nothing is worth doing by halves, so we
might as well make our showboats earn their
interest. Cruises- to the Islands are now popu-
lar, and the Canberra and Australia should
prove a big draw if put on this service. Their
lack of armor means plenty of portholes and
a well-ventilated ship.
By clearing out the magazines and other
useless and dangerous fittings, ample room
would be provided for passengers. It would
be a pity to take out the guns, as colored
balloons blown out of the muzzles on dance
nights have been known to create hilarious
amusement. All the superfluous specialist
ratings, both gunnery and torpedo, should be
landed to give place to barmen, musicians and
society-paragraph writers.
Any South American republic will provide
further suggestions.

Labor Appeals to Downing-street.
Party politics have been put aside by
the Westralian Labor Government so
that it may join with the Opposition in
securing separation from the Common-
wealth. A select committee of both
Houses has been formed to consider what
action shall be taken to “implement the
result of the secession referendum.”
Apart from other action, it is pro-
posed to submit a case to the Imperial
Government. This shows how little
the secessionists know about Australian
feeling or British policy. Australia and
its people object strongly to British in-
terference in domestic affairs ; nor, to do
it justice, does Britain want to interfere.
Australia was given a Commonwealth
Constitution so that it might for ever
manage its own concerns. It claimed,
and the claim was conceded, that its right
of autonomy should be construed in the
widest sense possible, short of actual
withdrawal from the Empire. Our own
Parliament, in Australian affairs and
under the King, has virtually an equal
status with the British Parliament. For
any State Government to acknowledge
otherwise is to admit that its power is
derived, not from the Australian electors,
but from the electors of Britain, and to
surrender the sovereign rights of its
inhabitants.
Even if the Imperial Government were
foolish enough to arrogate to itself the
right to cut Westralia off from the rest
of the continent, Australia would not
acknowledge it. The only Constitutional
authority which can set Westralia “free”
is vested in the Australian people.
The strangest part of the Perth hap-
penings is their origin. A few days
ago Australia saw Westralian Labor-
ites striking savagely at the ideal of
Australian-born and -appointed Gover-
nors —for that is what the attack
on the Mitchell appointment amounted
to. Now the party seems to have
turned Imperialist and to be out to kill
the evpn more characteristically Labor
ideal of Australian self-government.

“Your Worship.”
“Honi Soit” becomes a J.P.:
A Scotch printer to whom I had given
an order told me over the telephone that he
had arranged it with the local member. Local
member did not know me, but had no qualms
about providing the necessary recommenda-
tion ; he did not communicate with me till the
job was over. A policeman rang up and,
without asking who was speaking on my tele-
phone, plunged into a series of questions, such
as “Phwat ah-h-hr ye?” and ‘‘Phwere d’y’
wor-rk?”
The next I heard was in a bulky missive
from the Chief Secretary’s Department enclos-
ing what looked like the Cowper electoral
roll. It turned out to be the “new list,” in
which my name figured handsomely. I did
not count how many of my fellows there were
I—some 1 —some hundreds I should judge.
Then literature began to arrive—exactly the
same type of literature as is used to sell patent
medicines —begging me to join associations,
buy manuals and generally fork out cash.
The Justices’ Association sent me its official
journal, which appeared to carry one full-page
advertisement offering to relieve cancer lor
10s. 6d. with a bottle of medicine.
Presently I saw a notice in the paper advis-
ing that new Justices were being sworn in at
Darlinghurst. I went thither and found a
crowd that looked as if it had arrived for a
Woolworth bargain sale. It was the most
unjudicial-looking crowd I have ever seen, i
gathered that two of my fellow-magistrates who
were stood near me did not understand (1) the
difference between a District Court and a
Supreme Court, (2) the simple instructions
as to swearing-in which were contained in the
notice of appointment. After spending 10
minutes admiring the new dignitaries, I decided
not to be sworn in.
The Chief Secretary is quite hurt about it.
I am now “struck off the list.”
Isn’t it about time this farce was stopped
and the list of Justices cut down to a reason-
able limit of usefulness and ability? At
present it is said every debt-collector gets
himself made a J.P. because it helps him to
intimidate washerwomen; and I have noticed
recently that divorce inquiry agents, as a pre-
lude to the story of how they burst —illegally
—into somebody else’s house to catch the
guilty party, are in the habit of assuring the
awed jury “I am a Justice of the Peace.”
In Sydney and most big towns J’s.P. could
be wiped out altogether. If most of those
who were put on the list during the past few
years were allowed to exercise judicial func-
tions, there would be some of the gravest mis-
carriages of justice known in history since
the days of Nero.
4
Too Many Ministers.
Sydney is a great place for politicians.
It is not only burdened with 90 M’s.L.A.,
who are paid higher salaries than the
M’s.L.A. of other States, and with 118
Leg. Councillors (soon to be reduced to
60), but it has 15 Ministers. And each
of the 15 has a private secretary, at least
two typistes, an office with private bath-
room, and a limousine, with driver. The
Commonwealth is no type of economy;
still it gets along with 13 Ministers, in-
cluding Bruce, who is in London, and
who is doing the High Commissioner’s
work as well.
Stevens, it is said, wanted a smaller
Ministry ; but the general election gave
the two parties supporting him 66 mem-
bers. The C.P. demanded five portfolios,
and the U.A.P. said it must have ten. So
N. S. Wales, which returned a Govern-
ment to effect economies, found itself
loaded with the biggest State Ministry on
record. There are so many departments,
some added by politicians in recent years,
that distribution of the plums was ren-
dered easy.
Queensland, with twice the area to
govern, and with a great deal more de-
centralisation, has no Local Government
Department. The Home Secretary
administers the Local Government Act,
and there are few complaints. But N. S.
Wales has a Local Government Depart-
ment, with a Minister and staff. Spooner,
the Minister, plans to amalgamate shires
and municipalities. If he does it will
make still less work for his department.
One of his predecessors bespoke a larger
room in the Agricultural building, deco-
rated it lavishly and brought pictures
from the Art Gallery to adorn the walls.
Spooner is so busy helping the Treasurer
that he is rarely in his Local Govern-
ment office.
Then there is a Justice Department,
which controls prisons, the lower courts
and one or two other small matters.
There is no counterpart in other States,
where part of the work is done by the
Attorrtey-General and the rest by
the Chief Secretary. In N. S. Wales
the Chief Secretary controls the police
force, so why not the prisons?
Mines, Works and Transport could be
amalgamated in a Ministry of Public
Utilities. The Works Department has
become a joke. The Main Roads Board,
a branch of Transport, maintains roads
and bridges (including the Harbor Bridge)
with its own staff. The Education De-
partment builds some of its own schools.
Lands, Forests and Agriculture could
also be amalgamated with advantage to
the man on the land and the general tax-
payer. There is a Minister of Forests ;
there is also a Forestry Commission, pay-
ing rent to a private landlord.
There is also a Premier’s Department.
What a Premier who is also Treasurer
wants with a Premier’s Department only
he and the tin gods know.
♦
The Australian Yeoman.
“City Bushman” studies him:
There is much justifiable deprecation of the
national tendency to drift from the land into
the cities, and plans are always being canvassed
for stopping the drift. Worth studying, how-
eyer, is the land man who does not drift, worth
discovering are the attributes or reasons which
cause him’ to stay, and worth passing on
would be the results of the analyses.
Opportunity has been given me to watch
in Westmoreland dales and Radnorshire
marches, and on farms in N. S. Wales and
Queensland, four generations of two families
now blended in Australia. None of either
family has ever left the land except to go to
war: the English and Welsh as Yeomanry
in South Africa and Palestine; the Australians
as Bushmen and Diggers—and all went back
there.
Conservatism on the part of two generations
was to be foreseen. They had knowledge of
no other life than land life under most restricted
conditions; were born to it and never left it.
The third generation was, however, launched
differently into a brave new world.
This third all-Australian generation was most
interesting to watch. The Dad and Dave period
was over; education was on all lips; the bush
was receding before the telephone, the tractor
and the newspaper which arrived daily; the
old ways would not “do” the third generation.
I used the familiar warnings when it was pro-
posed to send the third generation, not merely
to city school, but to private grammar schools
with all unbucolic traditions and townie atmo-
sphere.
Well, the last of that third generation has
left school. Every member of it has gone back
to the land. And not back to Hawkesbury-
and Gatton-made ready-to-work farms; but, in
three cases, back to repossessed Crown blocks
and relinquished selections that demand really
hard toil. Moreover, the girls went back, too;
first as teachers in little bush schools, then as
working-farmers’ wives. A fourth generation
is well started, with young parents talking
ambitiously of what advantages their children
shall have in the way of schooling and social
amenities. None of them says “Not on the
land! ”
Of course, Generations Three and Four go
back to a land which is very different from
their fathers’ and mothers’: a land of radio
sets, tennis courts, ram pumps in creeks, one-
ton trucks, portable petrol engines, shearing
and milking machines, synthetic manures, mice-
proof silos, irrigation schemes; but the point is
that, in spite of city education and a taste of
city glamor in the malleable years, the young
Australian yeoman will stick to the land if
the tendency is there. In days not long gone
the Australian was a land man first‘and a city
man afterwards, so the tendency is only one
generation in abeyance.

Training Idle Lads.
Some well-meaning people in the Mel-
bourne suburb of Sandringham started
an organisation to cope with the prob-
lem of youth denied its legitimate oppor-
tunities. Ample publicity was given, but
only four boys enrolled. A retired
teacher went round and personally inter-
viewed unemployed boys; then results
were better.
The incident is significant. Unfulfilled
hopes have made the youth of to-day
feel hurt and despondent. Nobody out-
side his own immediate circle cares
whether a boy gets a job or not.
When the war ended there were thou-
sands of young fellows in much the same
position as young fellows of to-day. They
had learned how to fight, but not how to
earn their own living. A scheme of voca-
tional training was inaugurated by the
Commonwealth Government. It was
costly—unnecessarily costly—but it suc-
ceeded. What is to prevent a similar
scheme for our youthful unemployed
being organised by the present Common-
wealth Government, which withheld
bushels of income-tax assessments so
that its surplus would not be too large?
Nothing but inertia, apathy.
From a purely selfish point of view it
would pay the community to show these
lads that their economic welfare is worthy
of consideration. If nothing material is
done for them, Australia will pay dearly
for its neglect in the form of taxation
for doles, and maybe worse. In every
Australian suburb, in every country town,
'lasses, schools and clubs should be estab-
lished for the training of idle youths, the
Government helping with money and a
general plan. Retired teachers, artisans
and business men would be only too glad
to give their services in such a cause, as
many are doing in odd places to-day.
SITUATION WANTED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I work for the dole in a gutser gang,
shovelling bits of coast,
Me, who was once a carpenter, and
reckoned as good as most.
The toil we tackle the wind undoes—
sandhill, cutting and trench —
And I wish it’d whirl the years away
and blow me back to the bench.
Back to a decent job
With Eddie and Joe and Bob,
Using the tools I know and love, not
swinging a blasted spade.
Chatting away at lunch
With mates, with the good old bunch,
Not chewing mum in a strange platoon
of the down-and-out brigade.
I’m sick of answering questionnaires and
shuffling along in queues;
Of reading what rations the shops supply,
and what they must refuse;
Of having to gammon I’m strict t.t. when
asked to join in tids.;
Of seeing the missus, poor old girl, cut
up her things for the kids.
Back in the job I had!
And the boss —he was not so bad,
Though the union called him horrible
names the time we left him flat.
Stiff in the neck, perhaps,
No friend to socialist chaps;
But the pay went on when a man fell
ill, you’ve got to grant him that.
I met the boss in the street to-day. He’s
changed—like me, I suppose.
Old and worried and tired he looked;
shabby as mine his clothes.
“Things,” he tells me, “are getting on.
They’d be better than ever, you
know,
If only the bloody Government would
give a man a show.”
“Back in a job you’d be,
Terry,” he says to me,
“If only the rotten Government would
let the wheels go round.
Rest of the fellows, too,
I’ll have ’em all back like you,
Yes, some day, Digger— so don’t lose
heart, and here’s the loan of a
pound.”
On their poisonous forms they put me
down as “M., three daughters, a
son.”
It’s hard on a dad when birthdays come
and presents there are none
To feel my fingers close on a roll, and
hand it, with a kiss,
To the woman who’s never let us down —
“For you and the children, Sis!”
Back in the trade again,
In the world of useful men,
For the rest of the journey off the dole
and out of the broken mob!
Four years of charity, I!
A soul can be tried too high.
O God, Whose Son was a carpenter—
O Christ, give a man a job!

"AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKS"
“Nakh”: During a legal scramble in
Melbourne over a will it transpired that
the family census of one of the claim-
ants had been wrongly stated. This re-
calls an Adelaide case of some 20 years
ago, where a widow applied for damages
due to the breadwinner having been the
victim of an accident. The case was
adjourned from Friday to Monday, and
on reopening the lady’s counsel delicately
informed ’Sonah that it would be neces-
sary to amend the claim, as in the interim
there had been an addition of two to the
relevant population.

“Chandu”: In their discussions of
opium-taking (B. 30/8/’33), both “Hash-
eesh” and “Lao-dah” overlook the fact
that it is the use of the pipe that forms
the ineradicable habit, De Quincey, quoted
as an instance, usually drank laudanum,
“Why couldn’t you sleep last night?”
“A lullaby on the radio kept me awake.”
as did Coleridge ; both broke with
opium in the end. Most Asiatics, in the
writer’s experience of them, are accus-
tomed to eat opium in small doses as a
set-off to fatigue or when food is lack-
ing. No vicious habit seems to be
formed, nor does the user suffer physi-
cally, to outward appearance.
** A „
Lord Luvus : A leading member of
Melbourne’s Hebrew community is hav-
ing a quiet chuckle at the expense of a
bewildered headmistress of a denomina-
tional school. His two daughters are
pupils; they were not to be taught
theology. One of the girls, who has a par-
ticularly agile mind, somehow or other
evaded the High Command and actually
sat for the Bible-history examination. To
make matters worse, she won first prize ;
and, to make matters worse still, she was
presented with it, bore it home, and in
high glee handed it to her parent —it
was a New Testament! In the mean-
time the faux pas had been discovered,
and apologies were on the way from the
headmistress, with a promise to replace
the volume with something less contro-
versial, like “Oliver Twist” or Kipling’s
poems. It turned out that the enterpris-
ing daughter of the House of David had
spent the hour when she was turned out
of the theology lesson' standing in the
passage with her ear glued to the key-
hole !

“Royaume”: Kings out of a job are
so plentiful nowadays that the passing of
one was ignored in most newspapers. Yet
in the matter of his claims he must have
been the doyen of the lot, for the last rul-
ing monarch of the line was deposed at
Jerusalem in 1393. Guy de Lusignan
was his name, and Cyprus was his nation,
while his abdication followed on one of
the first arbitration courts on record, one
of the arbitrators, who decided in favor
of his rival, Conrad of Montserrat, being
Richard Coeur de Lion. Ever since then
the family has maintained its claim to
the thrones of Jerusalem, Cyprus and
Armenia. None seems particularly de-
sirable, but the last of the race, who died
in Italy the other day, kept pegging away
to the end.

“J. 8.”: The widening of Elizabeth-
street, Sydney, towards the Circular Quay
end provokes hard thoughts about the
rude forefathers of the city. As far
back as 1837 Governor Bourke signed
instructions whereby Elizabeth, Phillip
and C'astlereagh streets should all be
cut through to Sydney Cove in a straight
line. This was part of the scheme for
the removal of old Government House,
at the corner of Phillip and Bridge
streets. Ten years later, nothing having
been done in the meantime, the Sur-
veyor-General estimated the cost of the
job at £41,900, but, that being reckoned
prohibitive, the project lapsed. What
corner would £41,900 fill in the bill now?
That is, if these streets, modelled on the
hind leg of a dachshund, are ever straight-
ened out.

“Horrocks”: A few weeks ago a man
who looked to be penniless and friend-
less died in a Sydney public hospital, and
some £l2OO was discovered with his other
belongings in a locker. But that’s no-
thing: Martin Burke, who passed out
at Prince Alfred’s ten years ago,
was about to be buried as a pauper when
his papers revealed that he was a rich
man. He left assets- valued at £40,000,
and ever since the Public Trustee has
been grappling with the problem of find-
ing a rightful heir. Advertisements were
inserted in various overseas newspapers,
and naturally they produced a rush of
claimants, “more than 700.” Apparently
no one has been able to substantiate his
or her claim to the Martin Burke thou-
sands yet, but anyhow the money is
there, which is more than can be said
about some of the fabulous sums sup-
posed to be going a-begging in similar
cases. Burke is a pretty common name,
in Ireland especially, and perhaps the
wonder is that the applicants haven’t run
into thousands already. Still it would
have been worse for the Public Trustee
if the intestate had been named John
Smith.

“LG.”: Re the color of the shirts of
General O’Duffy’s followers in Ireland,
blue, and not green, .was the national
color of Ireland for centuries. Green
was first adopted by the United Irishmen
in 1792. Before that time the Irish flag was
always a blue one, with occasional vary-
ing of the design on it: at one time three
golden crowns (representing the three
Kings of Munster) and finally the golden
harp. When the United Irishmen were
getting to work the want of a flag to
rally both Protestants and Catholics to
the cause was felt, and it was finally
decided to blend the colors of southern
and western Ireland with those of the
North. The blending of the bright blue
with the orange of Ulster resulted in the
green. It was then that the color of the
blue Irish flag was changed to green, but
the yellow harp was retained. This flag
became the national flag, until it was
supplanted by the present tricolor of
green, white and orange.

recently counted 60 seconds for a M.L.

“X.N.0.”: If “X.S.’s” two Andrew
Hammonds (B. 30/8/’33) had been car-
ried to hospital after colliding the coinci-
dence would have been really extraordi-
nary. Yet that is substantially what hap-
pened in the English Channel in 1909.
H.M.S. Sappho was en route from South-
end to Portsmouth after the first naval
review staged specially for Londoners.
She collided with a merchant ship off
Beachy Head, and when the trader had
been beached to prevent her sinking the
astonished H.M.S. Sappho found that she
had nearly sunk the S.S. Sappho.
“General Prac.”: N. S. Wales has been
visited by a ’flu epidemic which has
behaved like a lady ; but in Brisbane the
roll-call for July re-
vealed 82 people dead
from respiratory causes,
mainly influenza and
its complications. In
Maoriland the old bel-
dam is at work with
her fellow-thug ence-
phalitis. As for the
genuine ’flu, wars are
fools beside it. In
1918-19 it swept the
planet, killing six mil-
lions in India ; even
Australia lost 12,000.
The moral? Keep to
yourself during an epi-
demic, especially if
you have a colcj.. And
the higher you are the
better. Germs of any
kind are rare on Mt. Kosciusko ; in a
crowded picture-theatre we gulp down
60,000 with every breath.

“El Verdugo”: The Henry VIII. talkie
produced at Elstree will give my old
colleagues of the axe and rope a good
laugh if they can possibly get a peep at
it. “Stills” prove it to be an awful mess
from a professional’s point of view. Anne
Boleyn is shown being beheaded on a
scaffold which, firstly, is in the wrong
place in the Tower- -the site is well estab-
lished. Secondly, it is too small, and has
all the wrong people on it —whereas half
the lady’s judges attended on the stage,
together with a smattering of Royalty, only
a miserable parson and the head-lopper
or two are present in the picture.
Thirdly, the young woman is done in
with axe and block, whereas—to her in-
tense disgust, for she was an ardent Pro-
tectionist—she was actually scuppered by
a blackleg non-unionist swordsman who
was imported from St. Omer, and who
did not use a block. Fourthly, even if a
block had been used, this one is the
wrong brand. The Tudors believed in
comfort, and provided a bit of wood low
enough to allow their victims to take
their medicine lying down. This block
j s a later breed. Lastly, you see the good
l a dy sticking her neck on the. wood with
pearls and jewellery hanging all over her
as if she were a Christmas tree. Do you
think a lad in a profession whose mem-
bers snatched the waiting women’s tips
from the hands of Mary Queen of Scots,
and stole her garters before her corpse
was cold, would have let any woman
risk spoiling good jewellery like that?
“0.0. W.”: The A.B.C. recently put on
a naval submarine radio play quite as
atmospherically ludicrous as “Hell Below”
(B. 30/8/’33). The lieutenant-commander
invariably called his second-in-command
“lieutenant,” a pure Americanism in a
play allegedly about a British submarine.
While staging a practice-attack on the
fleet the skipper and his No. 1 talked
about tea parties and the girl one of
them was going to marry and the
miseries of the submarine service, with
a few interpolated remarks about the
business in hand. Then they “fired” a
torpedo as if it were a gun, and, to cap
it all, somebody forgot something vital.
The craft was rammed by a destroyer
and the principal actors were drowned
in their compartment with agonising final
gurgles. They deserved it.

“Chevroford”: A phantom motor-car
has been haunting the Black Spur road,
the stiff climb over the Vic. Dandenongs.
Motorists approaching a particularly
dangerous corner sound their horns, and
when an answering note comes they slow
down and keep a sharp look-out as they
round the promontory. There is nothing
there. Investigation fails to reveal
the presence of a small boy or other
originating phenomenon in the brush-
wood. Superstitious fears have been
further aroused by the fact that the
’‘‘ghostly vehicle is invariably of the make
of the car it encounters, at least to the
extent that it always carries the same
make of noise apparatus, a klaxon, a bell
or what not. It now turns out that a
lyrebird has taken up its lodgings on the
spot. The creature is a wonderful mimic.

“Olney”: Speaking of Australia’s
taste for tea, rubbishy and otherwise, is
there a right and a wrong way of mixing
the cup that cheers without inebriating?
In England I never saw anybody put the
milk in first —that was in the ’seventies
and ’eighties. After a few years in this
country I began to notice that tea-makers,
women particularly, almost always make
the milk the first ingredient and pour the
tea into it. I thought at first this was
a purely Australian custom, in flat di-
vergence from the British practice, but
of late years I have noticed people who
haven’t been long from England doing
exactly the same thing. Is this merely
the influence of environment, or has the
fashion changed everywhere? I don’t
suppose it makes any real difference to
the flavor of a cup of tea whether the
milk goes underneath or above ; but we
are all of us the slaves of habit, and in
the former case (at least, if I see the
process) the beverage never seems the
right thing to me.
THE DEADLY INSULT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“At the conclusion of Mr. Lang’s censure motion,
a woman in the ladies’ gallery shook her fist at
the House, shouted ‘Yah!’ and put her fingers to her
nose. She escaped before the sergeant-at-arms could
assert the dignity of Parliament,”
She shook her fist as one whose wrath intensive
None from her burning censure could exempt,
And backed it with a bid as comprehensive
As he essays who would in bridge pre-empt—•
That gesture the reverse of inoffensive,
Indicative of juvenile contempt;
The vehemently contumelious pose
That just demands thumb, fingers and a nose.
She shook her fist, a symbol and a token
Of hot defiance since the world began,
An augury that peace is to be broken
In righteous ire or passion partisan,
A challenge, deadlier because unspoken,
Borrowed, regrettably, from erring man;
But for the other pantomimic biz,
That was her own idea, I’ll say, not his.
She shook her woman’s fist and in addition
A shrill expressive “Yah!” the silence tore;
In truth a fairly frequent ebullition
Which, when employed upon the Chamber’s
Iloor,
Earns at the most a gentle admonition,
But in her case, alack! was something more.
She made the ages-old dumb crambo crack
A gamin might—behind a copper’s back.
She shook her fist and then she spread her
fingers
Fanwise and in a fashion hard to brook.
The word is one eschewed by courtly singers
Like me, nor has it place in any book;
But if your curious fancy on it lingers,
Get down your fngoldsby—turn up “Nell
Cook”
And find the method, vulgar, old and worn,
Whereby the sacristan exuded scorn.
She shook her fist, then laid with fierce precision
Her thumb upon her nose, as one who aims;
Hers was the attitude that drips derision
And coarsely blatant ridicule proclaims,
While members eyed askance the vengeful vision
And long-dead statesmen shuddered in their
frames.
She shook her fist—an insult dire, no doubt —
Then (crowning gibe!) she spread her fingers
out!

“Lao-dah”: Melbourne’s Chinatown
has been hit by Depresh as much as
Flinders-lane. LiT Bourke-street never
lacked its lounging Celestials at the best
of times, but now they are in the major-
ity. Market-gardening is in the doldrums
and cabinet-making has almost ceased.
Importation of Cantonese bric-a-brac has
been knocked endways by Japanese com-
petition. Time was when the unemployed
would have been absorbed by the family
system of collective responsibility and by
the guilds and so-called “secret” societies,
but the foreign devils’ humanitarianism
has altered all that. Ah Sin now goes
on the dole.
❖ H* t- sj:
“Searchlight”: Few people revisiting
Sydney after 20 or 30 years but com-
ment on the changes, particularly in some
of the erstwhile slums. I wonder if they
are anywhere more marked than in old
Wexford-street and the row of squalid
tenements, inhabited mostly by Chinese,
where I once had to operate as a rent-
collector. The Chinese were adept at
avoiding such a visitor, but once I
managed to bail them up at the last house
in the terrace, whither they had drifted
along the back lane, which my assistant
blocked. They paid up to a man, and
mostly in gold coin, which they dragged
from grimy pockets or slipper heels. I
never expect to see as much gold again
as I collected that day. We almost for-
gave them their elusiveness as we pock-
eted the gold, and they jabbered and
smiled as only Celestials can when
handed their receipts.

“Nakhoda”: According to a cable, the
16-year-old widow who threw herself
on her husband’s funeral pyre in Cal-
“Did your husband enjoy the caterpillar you took home for his tea?”
“No. He’s gone right off his grub.”
cutta was grief-stricken at the loss of her
helpmate. There are plenty of other good
reasons to account for her determination
to accompany her husband into the here-
after, however. There are 27 million
widows in India, a large proportion mere
children. For them to marry again is a
mortal sin, and for the husbands it is
pollution. The normal fate of an Indian
widow is to be a domestic slave to her
late husband’s family. She is obliged
to do all the dirty work about the house,
and kicks and abuse are her portion.
Before 1829, when the Government
forbade suttee, the widow who jumped
into the flames was regarded as
a model for all the others. She had
done what was expected of her. Ortho-
dox Hindus were so shocked at the Brit-
ish law that they took an appeal to the
Privy Council, with the approval of the
great majority of Indian women. Re-
spect for long-established custom dies
hard ; in the present century I was in
Java when the Dutch had to send a war-
ship to prevent 20 widows from immo-
lating themselves at the burning of a
Rajah’s body in Hindu Bali. The ladies
could have avoided their fate if they had
wanted to by seeking white protection,
but they deliberately went bush to escape
rescue and didn’t give themselves up until
they were starved out.
“Fancar”: However fashions change,
a woman’s shape remains just the same
under her clothes. The present mode of
narrow hips (B. 9/8/’33) is merely a tri-
bute to dress designers for their clever
manipulation of line and the use of epau-
lettes, cowl and cape collars to create
an illusion of shoulders as wide as or
wider than hips.
“Vrouw”: Tell “Sandig” that attached
on either side just below the waist of
a Netherlands lady’s bodice are what
look like little sandbags, about nine
inches long and a couple of inches in
diameter. It is these, together with the
voluminous petticoats worn underneath
the full skirl, which give the effect of
large hips.
* * * *
“Soso”: In N.S.W. every permanent
Clerk of Petty Sessions is a J.P., and yet de-
partmental red tape debars the C.P.S. from
sitting on the Bench, although many of
them presently become police and stipen-
diary magistrates. In matters of statute
law and the laws of evidence, the aver-
age J.P. is always turning to the C.P.S.
for guidance ; why, then, should not the
qualified man hear cases in the absence
of the police magistrate? It would at
least prevent such incidents as one which
I recall in an outback town. An old J.P.
on the Bench severely admonished two
men convicted of stealing a boat, which
was afterwards sold for £3. He then
inquired of the constable how much
mopey the offenders had left, and was told
that one man was broke, but that the
other still had 10s. He thereupon fined
the latter 10s. and discharged the other.
“Contrariwise”: There has been a
pleasing interlude in the general welter
of inventing means of killing one’s neigh-
bor. An English chemist has devised a
new gun, the purpose of which is to save
life. Known as the CO2 gun, it stores
an admixture of oxygen and carbon
dioxide. It is so compact that it can
be carried in the pocket, and so is avail-
able at a moment’s notice, and it is used
in cases of apparent drowning or in any
other instance where asphyxiation
threatens life. Already several lives have
been saved by its use, and there is talk
of equipping the Thames police and simi-
lar bodies with the instrument,
* * * *
“Tellicherry”: Long Bay (N.S.W.),
which a White Australian Government
has rechristened with the name of the
blackest coast in Asia—Malabar—has
had an adventurous history. Bushrangers,
shipwrecks and hangings have dotted its
career, and its quod is accounted one of
the most eligibly-situated gaols in Aus-
tralia. For me, however, it always will
be remembered as the suburb in which
dwelt (in Sir Harry Johnston’s “Rela-
tions”) the Lady Justinia Bnghtholm,
“wife of a N. S. Wales Senator and
sheep farmer,” and “almost the leading
lady of the place, except that the new
Governor’s wife was a person of higher
rank and world-famous beauty.” To
Australian ears the lady’s choice of a
residence sounds all the funnier because
her palace was “situated behind impos-
j n g entrance gates.” Not that titled per-
“I rushed straight at the big brute an knocked him kicking”
“You, Billy? A big fellow. Nonsen se!”
"What’s happened to your wits? I TOLD you I was drivin’ the sedan.”
sons have not lived at Long Bay in
reality. One of my acquaintance, who
had appointed himself Chief Commis-
sioner of Customs for Ceylon, and then
knighted himself for his services in the
post, recently occupied quarters in the
local castle during the turnip-planting
season as the result of his having mar-
ried his landlady for her money.
“X.S.”: Why do Australian Judges and
lawyers still stick to the insanitary wig,
with its funny little qurls and crinkles?
The practice hasn’t even the sanction of
antiquity ; it is only two or thre,e cen-
turies old. Everybody wore wigs in those
days, but the ordinary citizen soon gave
the custom up. The clergy were the next
to abandon wigs. The legal fraternity still
nail the emblem to the mast, possibly for
the reason that the laws they interpret
still reflect musty precedent.

“Indcar”: If the pronunciation of
“centenary” has agitated Melbourne,
“eisteddfod” has led to even more differ-
ences in Sydney. During the past week
or two I have heard broadcasters making
it eye-sted-fod, es-ted-fod, est-eth-fod
and est-ed-vod, with a few
more variations. The chair-
man of one musical section, in
introductory remarks, used
three variations in five
minutes, thus displaying tact
of a high order. It reminds
one of Galli-Curci’s Austra-
lian visit, when some humorist
suggested that Australians
might be divided into two
classes —those who could pro-
nounce the singer’s name pro-
perly, and those who thought
they could.
“Spasebo”: The retentive memory of
a young Kalgoorlie constable was re-
sponsible for the capture of Raisberg.
the Polish “financier” who has just been
given board and lodging at the public
expense in Melbourne. The constable
saw a photo, of Raisberg circulated by
the Vic. police, promptly identified it
with a man he had just seen in the street,
and a few minutes later had laid his hand
on the original. Raisberg's financial sys-
tem consisted of a proposal to buy
American bonds, exchange them for dol-
lars and sell the dollars, making a profit
of Is. lid. on each coin. He obtained
two partners, one of whom prematurely
rejoiced when he got a cheque for £2BOO,
said to come out of the profits. The
cheque was dishonored, but in the mean-
time the “financier” had flitted.
*
“0.T.”: “10-2-4” (B. 9/8/’33) is a
poor psychologist when he contends,
after considering Shaw and Einstein, that
Gandhi is ahead of all modern celebrities
for vanity. The Mahatma’s nakedness
means nothing more than an outward
and visible sign of fellow-feeling for the
myriads of physical Gandhis he is seek-
ing to “uplift.” Even his grin is due
not to excessive vanity, but to excessive
timidity. His almost inaudible talkie
voice surely testifies to that. I agree
with “10-2-4” that G. B. Shaw has been
laughing at himself, as well as his public,
ever since his red-bearded days. As for
Einstein, a mathematical brain is a logi-
cal brain and never a vain brain, though
it is very often an egoistical one. But
egoism is not necessarily vanity.
“Cine Ma”: The 8.8. C., which regu-
larly indulges in a television session, re-
cently broadcast a boxing match, the
smack of gloves on flesh being trans-
mitted at full strength, while diminutive
figures of the fighters appeared on a
screen Bin. by 14in. The fact that
the spectacle caused audiences to dis-
solve in hysterical laughter shows how
easily a convention can be imposed on
people. Exactly the opposite pheno-
menon is visible and audible in any
ordinary moving-picture theatre. The
close-up of a man's head as big as a
house will speak in ordinary conversa-
tional undertones and cause no surprise
whatever.

“F.S.”: Goodness knows how many
thousands of pounds' worth of pictures
lie mouldering in the vaults of the Vic.
Nat. Gallery. The figure must be tre-
mendous. • If all this antique lumber
were brought up out of the cellar and
hung simultaneously the public would
get a convincing demonstration of how
badly its money has been spent in the past.
And there is nothing more certain than
that many comparatively recent pur-
chases will some day be prudently buried
from the gaze of the populace. The
Gallery would help the State’s finances
if it put up its surplus stock for auction.
Most of them would have some value,
if it was only sentimental.

“M.G.”: Sorrento (Vic.) proposes to
hold a special centenary celebration to
emphasise the fact that Lieut. Collins and
his convicts occupied Port Phillip several
years before Batman stumbled on the
site of Melbourne. On January 31, 1934,
it will be exactly 130 years since Collins
pulled up his tentpegs, declaring that
Victoria was unfit for white habitation.
Some of his reasons were the same as
are advanced by people against the white
colonisation of Port Darwin —the poverty
of the soil and the unsuitability of the
climate.
IF I WERE MARE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
‘‘The Lord Mayor of Sydney considers it an
admirable idea that a selected Boy Scout should
periodically be familiarised with the illusion of being
Lord Mayor for a day.”
If I were Mare, good Lord, if I were Mare,
And took my seat in that illustrious chair
To have my crowded hour of baubled life,
Of blatant babble and of factious strife,
There’d be some applecarts upset, I’ll swear.
How loud the Bumbles howled I wouldn’t care.
There’s lots of things in which I’d get my
knife
If I were Mare.
If I were Mare, you mark, if I were Mare,
I’d count the social side of the affair,
The stately car wherein around you lob,
The haberdashery that gives a throb
To female hearts, the chain so rich and rare,
The frills and frippery, the limelight’s glare,
As merely incidentals of my job,
If I were Mare.
If I were Mare, my oath! if I were Mare,
There’d be no drifting back to as-you-were
In those bad days of jobbery and brawl
Before our civic fathers, one and all,
Were emptied out and booted down the stair;
The days when murky scandals filled the air
And cynics spelled the premises “Town Haul,’’
If I were Mare.
If I were Mare, good Lord, if I were Mare,
I’ll bet ’twould raise a flutter and a scare.
The first objective that we Scouts pursue
Is one good deed each passing day to do,
One deed a day at least, as you’re aware.
I’d find material for a hundred there
Right to my ’prentice hand—and then a few,
If 1 were Mare.

This fact should be graven on stone
and erected over somebody’s political
grave: The Commonwealth collected
£598 in sales tax from Vic. unemployed-
relief funds on £9965 worth of clothing
for the workless. The clothing had been
bought at cost rates by the Tender
Board, with the help of the Chamber
of Manufacturers.
If the Stevens Government is as good
as its Premier’s word, it will presently
abolish the family-endowment tax. This
is the most successful work-reducing
measure ever devised. A Sydney con-
cern known to The Bulletin put on
15 more hands last year. For this, and
because the tax was increased to sd. in
the £ of wages, it paid another £l2OO
in endowment-tax. And there were
workers’-compensation charges—-in effect,
another tax —as well.
Queensland Labor abolished the Leg.
Council in spite of a referendum, at which
there was a great majority for preserving
it. The party now proposes a Constitu-
tional amendment forbidding the restora-
tion of the Chamber without a referen-
dum. Inconsistency? Not a bit of it,
according to Forgan Smith ; “we tak’ a
br-road view o’ th’ referendum, ye ken.”
After 16 years of the Glorious Revolu-
tion, the Russians are to be fed on emu
meat and eggs, the U.S.S.R. having de-
cided to acclimatise the ungainly fowl.
In a way it is appropriate, for any Com-
munist spouter who has masticated emu
breast regularly for a year will develop
jaw muscles like Balaam’s ass. And as
a national emblem for Stalinland, the
emu could scarcely be beaten. It has
an unapproachable amount of neck. It
will swallow anything, even Russian pro-
paganda, without preliminary inquiry or
ill effects. It can be caught by waving
a red rag, which seems to fascinate it.
And what an election egg it lays!
The Lang “party” in South Aus. is
a faithful small edition of the parent
body. Dale, one of its three Assembly-
men, was told he was to be expelled by
the other two. He replied by challeng-
ing Bardolph, “who poses as leader of
the ‘party,’ to resign his seat and I will
resign mine ; if he does that he will never
enter Parliament again.” The gentle-
man plaintively added:
Since I have been in the Lang party it has
cost me for my four trips to the eastern States
in the interests of the Lang party, £43; also
£23 for my election expenses, and £62 expenses
for the Court of Disputed Returns, besides
other small amounts to our supporters; total,
£l2B.
Seemingly there is no tin-hare election-
money in South Aus.
Power to levy distress on a tenant
without recourse to a Court was vigor-
ously attacked in Vic. Assembly last week
when a bill to abolish it, sponsored by
Maurice Blackburn, was passed. All the
other legal members of the House, Attor-
ney-General Menzies, Slater (Labor) and
Hollway (U.A.P.), supported the mea-
sure. Party lines were obliterated, and,
for once, the Chamber looked like a real
Parliament.
Queensland has 30,118 persons on the
State payroll, an increase of 1200 for the
year. Forgan Smith says this is due to
“the accelerated works policy” of his
Government. It takes 1804 Treasury
officials to collect the cash —an increase
of 53 since last year is possibly due
to the larger deficit. Lands has 904 em-
ployees, Agriculture 563, Mines 566.
Two-thirds of all Queensland employees,
however, are either railwaymen or
teachers.
N.S.W. Premier Stevens has appointed
a Commissioner to hear the evidence for
and against the separation of the River-
ina from N.S.W. The Commissioner is
a K.C. and no doubt will get a fat fee.
though not as fat a one as Shand, K.C.,
got for penning the pigeonholed report
on the Milk Board. Meanwhile the
“United Australia Review,” published by
the U.A.P. (Stevens, president), prints the
Riverina people’s map with sarcastic re-
marks. “This is not a cartoon,” it sneers,
“but the suggested New State of River-
ina.”
Creation of a statutory board to regu-
late prices to be paid to producers and
by consumers is recommended by the
Milk Board set up by the Vic. Govern-
ment under the authority of the Act
passed last year. With zone deliveries,
in which a limited number of retailers
would be licensed to operate, it is esti-
mated that cost of distribution would
be so reduced that producers would get
more than the 6d. to Bd. a gallon net
they now receive, and consumers would
be charged less than the Is. Bd. to 2s. they
now pay. The Argyle section of the

“Hooray! Now, perhaps, they'll cut taxes a bit!”
Ministry dislikes price-fixing, but the
Nats., young and old, might agree to a
Bill giving effect to the Milk Board’s
main proposals if the Agrarians accepted
the Transport Regulation Bill launched
by Minister Menzies.
How will Westralia defend itself if
it quits the Commonwealth? No seces-
sionist has ever explained, and the other
day, when the Federal octopus offered
to return portion of the land south of
Fremantle resumed for naval-base pur-
poses, the Labor Government hastily
declined the gift. The refusal was
announced by Minister Kenneally, who
is a secesh unificationist —at all events,
he is chairman of the Federal A.L.P.
executive, which has been committed
to unification for 15 years. Mr. Ken-
neally’s position is rather like that of
Mr. Lynch, who is for secession as a
representative of Westralia and for Fed-
eration as President of the Senate. It
would be charming to see these tribunes
on the same platform, but their relations
are scarcely more cordial than those of
Mr. De Valera and General O’Duffy.
Some of the S. Aus. Libs, are against
five-year Assemblies, so Butler—making
a virtue of necessity—says the bill won’t
be regarded as “vital.” A Labor amend-
ment that the bill shall not become effec-
tive till after the next election will take
a lot of getting past, and there is strong
public sympathy with the expressed out-
look of other members that unemploy-
ment, taxation and housing should be
occupying the attention of the House
instead of selfish measures of self-preser-
vation.
The announcement of a voluntary
scheme of insurance for medical benefits,
in which the State branch of the B.M.A.
and the Colonial Mutual are joined, has
raised the bristles of Queensland friendly
societies, which see certain loss of revenue
if the thing catches on. Government also
disapproves of the plan, which would
cut into its cherished State insurance
enterprise, while it has to keep a careful
ear on the complainings of the societies,
most of which are made up of Labor
supporters. In Victoria, which has no
Golden Brisket to draw on for hospital
money, a similar scheme is succeeding.
The combination of the guillotine and
the division system is being developed
to a stage when the main duty of an
M.L.A. will be to sit on a bench and be
counted like a sheep. Lang, who knows
he hasn’t the slightest chance of defeat-
ing the Government, calls “divide” on
almost every question these days ; and
whenever he does it, apart from the time
wasted, the names of all members have to
be printed at the taxpayers’ expense. In
the journals for Aug. 29 the whole list
appears five times ; on the next day, the
tally was the same. Every vote was
strictly party. The best the Langsters
could do was to muster up 23 oppo-
nents of a proposal on which the Gov-
ernment had 37 heads behind it.
Confectioner Macßobertson has wisely
abandoned his proposed gift to Victoria
of a Temple of Youth. The proportion
of his £lOO,OOO present which was to
go into the temple will now be devoted
to a new herbarium in the Botanic Gar-
dens. There are few differences of
opinion about what is the best soil for
herbs, but hardly anybody is agreed as
to the soil in which the plant man will
flourish.
Brisbane’s civic debt has been re-
duced by £224,088, and now stands at
£17,689,528. It doesn’t seem much when
you say it quickly, but it is equal to £6O
per head of population, which is a rather
solid municipal slug for citizens who
already carry £llB per head of State
debt and £59 iss. 1 Id. per head of Com-
monwealth debt. Just think of it: every
Queensland youngster born is loaded
down with a liability of £238 —three
pounds of solid gold, at par, the moment
it gives its first cry!
Remodelling and extension of the Vic.
public offices are again proposed. The
main portion was completed at the end
of 1877, and some of the seniors were
just comfortably settled when Black
Wednesday descended on them in Jan.,
1878. Works Minister Jones is anxious
to try his hand at the remodelling job,
and hopes to get £40,000 of unemployed-
relief money to play with.
When Vic. Labor was last in Opposi-
tion there was ground for the suspicion
that “teasing” questions were drawn out
of a hat and asked in the Leg. Assembly.
Apparently the same thing is going on
again. Among the multitude of questions
fired at Ministers was one demanding
to know whether the Government would
propose a tax on newspaper ads. There
is one tax which the Labor party posi-
tively hates: that placed on Parliament-
ary pay by way of percentage reduc-
tion —191 per cent, in the case of city
members and 9\ per cent, in the case of
country members.
Commonwealth income-tax figures give
an indication of how primary and manu-
facturing industries have fared as a
result of depression. Between the years
1929-30 and 1930-31 the number of tax-
able manufacturing incomes fell 33 per
cent., while the number of taxable pas-
toral and agricultural incomes declined
41.7 per cent. The decline in amount
of pastoral and agricultural incomes was
42.9 per cent, as against 44.9 per cent,
in manufacturing incomes.
Commonwealth Statistician’s figures
show decreases in the cost of living for
July, compared with the previous month,
in four States: Westralia, 3.8 per cent.;
Victoria and S. Aus., 1.2 per cent.;
Queensland, .4 per cent. Tasmania was
unchanged, and in N. S. Wales costs
went up .6 per cent. There was a de-
crease of .7 per cent, on an average in
six capitals and 30 towns. It is not
enough. Considering the fall in wages,
necessary commodities should be much
cheaper ; but how can they be when it
frequently happens that more than half
of retail prices is represented by passed-
on taxation? It is a pity that retailers
cannot find some way of indicating this.
If on every article sold were branded,
say,
Jam .. .. ..2d.
Taxes .. .. .. 4d.
Total price .. .. 6d.
taxpayers might up and insist on a
fair deal.

town on the Murray, in S.A., was origin-
ally Loxton’s wood-pile on the river
bank, the nearest spot to that settler’s
home on a bit of Bookpurnong station.
Loxton is still living in Adelaide, at 90.
His wife, who was 17 when she went into
the bush with him, has just died.
Hope seems to be abandoned for Carl
Nauer, the Swiss boy who flew to Aus-
tralia last May, and has since been lost
in the Congo. He was a bright young-
ster, the son of a leading Swiss X-ray
specialist, and he had hopes of coming
back here on a flight round the world.
So dreams pass!
Alfred Langan, who died the other
day, spent almost all his life in the ser-
vice of the Sydney “Daily Telegraph,”
of which he was advertising manager for
35 years, secretary for a few more and
finally general manager for three. He
was a cheery soul, even amid the vicis-
situdes of the “D.T.’s” last years under
the old proprietary. His pastime was
yachting. He took an active part both in
Sydney Harbor racing and in the affairs
of the Royal Prince Alfred Yacht Club,
and his conversation had a flavor of the
sea about it. “I hear they’ve got an-
other new manager at the ‘D.T.,’ ” said
somebody to him one day, after he had
given up the job. “New manager! ”
snorted the old gentleman. “The mother
of every director up there was a codfish
—they fairly spawn new managers!”
Dr. A. C. Halford, whose picture
appears below, is one of the land-
marks of Brisbane. His Clayfield surgery
even before the war was a gathering
centre for the halt and the maimed for
miles around, and in recent years his long
standing has tended to make him a medi-

cal institution rather than an ordinary
practitioner. Despite his private business,
however, he has always been ready to
burn extra midnight oil in the cause of
civic duty, and he is well known in public
life. He is chief medical officer to the
Royal National Association.
T. A. Blarney, whose permanent
appointment as Police Commissioner in
Victoria has been decreed by the local
Ministry, is one of many Australian sol-
diers whose ability have outrun their
opportunities. A Wagga (N.S.W.) native,
he was a permanent soldier, 30 years old,
when war broke out, a Quetta Staff Col-
lege training behind him and an inexhaust-
ible store of energy and capacity for clear-
thinking at his disposal. Monash thought
him one of the best organisers in the
Allied armies, and he had an international
reputation for the clarity with which he
could draft complicated large-scale
orders. Some of Blarney’s orders are
used as models to-day in British staff
colleges. After Brudenell White vacated
the job he was Chief of Staff to the Aus-
tralian Army Corps. Blarney was men-
tioned in dispatches seven times and col-
lected a bucketful of decorations.
Professor KERR GRANT, of Adelaide,
president of the recent physics con-
ference held in Melbourne.
W. E. Clapin, who has retired from
the job of Usher of the Black Rod in
Macquarie-street, Sydney, has served the
N. S. Wales Parliament since 1907.
Before that his father, who rose to be
acting-clerk, had been a Parliamentary
official since 1853 —three years before
the establishment of responsible govern-
ment. It says something for the enthusi-
asm of the family for this sort of thing
that the younger generation now retiring
desires to be a Leg. Councillor!
Brisbane’s shipping circle will lose M.
J. Scott next month. Since August, 1890,
he has been continuously on the staff of
Macdonald, Hamilton and Co. and their
ancestor companies, and he knows heaps
more about the Queensland coastal trade
than most men. He has managed Mac-
donald, Hamilton in Queensland since
1925. For two years Scott was chair-
man of the Brisbane Waterside Em-
ployers, and he is now president of the
State branch of the Australasian Steam-
ship Owners’ Federation and a director
of several companies.
Poor De Pinedo, who crashed to his
death in U.S.A., was the most debonair
of modern flying men. He flew round
the world in 1925 with an aeroplane that
looked like a brightly-colored insect and
the liveliest stave of “Funiculi, funicula”
painted on his fuselage. The sight of
him, all smiles, dropping down easily
into Farm Cove (Sydney), with pompous
officialdom scurrying out of his way
like hens, was one never to be forgotten.
He was the nearest approach to a butter-
fly probably ever born in human form,
but, alas! he came too near the bright
light of Mussolini and got his wings
singed.
Gerald Sharp, Archbishop of Brisbane
since 1921 and acting-Primate of Aus-
tralia since Archbishop Wright’s death,
is dead. He did not look like a Most Rev.
and a D.D. Like Donaldson, his prede-
cessor in the see, he was a bachelor, but
there the resemblance ended. Donaldson,
though he was the son of the first Aus-
tralian Premier in history, affected long
coats, rosettes and gaiters ; Sharp had
had 12 years in New Guinea before he
came to Bishopsbourne, and was much
more comfortable in shirt sleeves. He
was Cheshire-born, Cambridge-educated,
and before his immigration to these parts
was Proctor of the Convocation of the
Archdeaconry of Ripon and vicar of
Whitkirk in Yorkshire. Rumor already
is busy with the name of his successor —
suggestions are De Witt Batty, Bishop of
Newcastle and formerly Sharp's coad-
jutor-bishop ; Dr. Ayscough, vicar of
East Finchley, London, a Brisbane-born
six-footer, who erstwhile was British
general secretary of the Church of Eng-
land Temperance Society, and 'Dixon,
the present coadjutor.
A Westralian with a fine record, Wing-
Commander R. M. (“Peter”) Drummond,
recently relinquished command of the
Tangmere air station to become director
of training at the British Air Ministry.
Drummond, one of the most distin-
guished flyers in the Royal Air Force,
was educated at Scotch College, Clare-
mont, Westralia. Enlisting with the
A.1.F., he made a name for himself by
his daring exploits as a pilot during the
Palestine campaign.
Norman White, who becomes manag-
ing director of Brisbane’s amalgamated
newspaper group, is a Tasmanian, edu-
cated at Hobart. He came to Queens-
land 40 years ago, and after 22 years of
commercial experience in the country,
largely in timber, he suddenly arrived
in Brisbane, to become manager of the
“Daily Mail,” in 1915. White took to
journalism as a duck does to water. When
he went to the “D.M.” it was a flamboy-
ant production, full of racing competi-
tions but empty of advertising, and its
staff was engaged in a continual internal
war. In three years the “Courier” was
thinking hard about its rival, of which
White had been promoted managing
director. If, as has been suggested, the
union of the “Courier” and the “Mail”
was due to the latter’s losses, the new
combined directorate does not hold it
against White. The Brisbane non-Labor
press is now entirely managed by Tas-
manians—Cummins, general manager of
the “Telegraph,” came to his job from the
general-managership of the Hobart
“Mercury.”
C. E. Merrett celebrates the 70th year
of his age and his 30th year as a coun-
cillor of the Victorian Royal Agricul-
tural Society in 1933. He has been presi-
dent of the Royal since 1915, but his
other activities are legion. Thirty-seven
years in the Defence Force and the com-
mand of three separate Light Horse
regiments, the chairmanship of the Com-
Col. C. E. MERRETT, who has been
president of the Royal Agricultural
Society of Vic. since 1915.
monwealth Council of Rifle Associations
and membership of the Metropolitan
Board of Works and of the Town Plan-
ning Commission have not destroyed his
energy, and his chief delight is still work.
He got a C.B.E. in 1929.
Frederick Egerton Bryant, whose pic-
ture appears on this page, holds more
directorates and offices than most people,
but it doesn’t seem to weigh him down,
and no one would credit him with being
75 years old. Bryant is one of those
rare people who seem to have no ene-
mies. He is an Ipswich-born Brisbane
Grammar School boy who rose to be
general manager of the Union Bank —•
F. E. BRYANT, formerly g,m, of the
Union Bank.
the school, by the way, runs to bankers,
for it also educated A. C. Davidson, of
the Wales. Bryant knows Australia finan-
cially as few men know it, for he served
as State manager, sub-manager or
accountant in every State and M.L. be-
fore becoming head of the Union. Apart
from business, he has wide charitable
interests, is managing trustee of the Ger-
man Verge Repatriation Trust, takes an
active part in the affairs of Sydney Hos-
pital and the Boys’ Brigade, and is trea-
surer of the Sane Democracy League.
Henry Valentine Bache de Satge, who
has arrived from London to look us
over, comes of a family which had its
distinguished representatives in Queens-
land until a few years ago. He himself
is well known to Australians who were
at the Imperial Conference of 1926, for
he was at that time ceremonial secre-
tary to the Dominions Office. Over
30 years ago he was A.D.C. to a Gov-
ernor of Westralia. He later went to
the Bar and the war, where he earned
a D.S.O. and a C.M.G. and commanded
a brigade of the R.F.A. In these days
he is a Gentleman Usher to the King.
At 80, Mundi, one of the best-known
citizens of Cooktown (N.Q.), has retired
from his job as native wardsman at the
Cooktown police station. He was pro-
bably the oldest member of the force —
he had been in it 62 years. In the old
days there was no smarter tracker and no
better shot, as every policeman needed
to be in the days when Jack was still
exploring the Peninsula and Coen and
Ebagoolah hummed with life. Mundi
was wounded several times in forays with
the savage Cape tribes, who were for
ever treading on the tails of the police
tunics, with satisfactory results to both
parties.
Son of Dr. R. N. Morrison, of Mel-
bourne, G. N. L. Morrison, who re-
cently returned to Victoria to spend his
furlough, is a nephew of Dr. George
Ernest Morrison, of the “Times” (“Chin-
ese” Morrison). Like his Geelong-born
uncle, G. N. L. Morrison has made a
name for himself in Asia—not in China,
but in the vast area that embraces Tur-
key, Arabia and the Sudan. He is an offi-
cial of the Sudan Civil Service. He did
his bit in 1914-18 with the Black Watch.

What is their
SAFETY worth?
Consider this well. Without any increase in your outlay, you can provide
your family with more protection, and secure tyres which will deliver
longer mileage—making it a matter of good judgment to buy Goodyear
Tyres.
No other tyres assure an equal measure of safety—the famous diamond-
shaped All-Weather Tread of Goodyear Tyres, with its centre traction,
is the only real non-skid tread design; and the Supertwist Cord carcass *
absorbing shock and strain renders Goodyear Tyres safer against
blowouts.
And, yet, despite their extreme safety, strength and durability,
Goodyear Tyres cost no more than other tyres—as a matter of fact,
they are lower-priced than ever before, prices having recently been
reduced 10%.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Moulton Tobacco Manoeuvres
The “Wild Cat” has previously called
attention to the methods of E. S. and R.
C. Moulton, Ltd., and its net of inter-
locking cos., thrown out for the purpose
of gathering in money, on the strength
of extravagant prospectus estimates and
promises, for tobacco- and timber-grow-
ing schemes.
Some persons may have enriched them-
selves from the intricate operations of the
Moulton group, but it certainly has not
been the bondholders in Queensland
Forests or shareholders in the National
Tobacco Corporation. During the 12
months to June, 1932, the latter co. made
a profit of only £l9B, and no div. was
paid. The “Wild Cat” has a prospectus
issued by E. S. and R. C. Moulton. Ltd ,
on which appear the names of E. S.
and R. C. Moulton as directors, and
R. C. Moulton as secretary; it invites
people to become interested in “two of
Australia’s great money-making indus-
tries —tobacco cultivation and tobacco
manufacture.” The National Tobacco
Corp. is one of the assortment of Moul-
ton enterprises in which the prospective
investor is invited to place his money ;
by the contract under which he becomes
involved his “investment” is spread over
a series of Moulton incubations.
But while this prospectus, by alluring
pictures, is endeavoring to unload
tobacco-shares and land on behalf of un-
specified vendors at very high prices—
a 96 p.c. interest in a tobacco-manufac-
turing co. with a subscribed capital of
£25,000 is generously offered for £36,000
—a different tale is told to debenture-
holders in the National Tobacco Corp.
It is suggested that they should surrender
their mortgage rights and convert into
preference shares.
One R. S. Moulton, who signs as sec-
retary for Aust. Trustees and Execs.,
Ltd. —another Moulton concern, which
is supposed to look after the interests of
bondholders, contractees, etc., in Moul-
ton enterprises, who otherwise have no
say in the management —asks debenture-
holders in the Tobacco Corp. to submit
to the conversion scheme, because re-
turns to tobacco-growers have been cut
by two-thirds owing to tariff alterations.
The conversion is designed “to permit
the co. to divert capital into other chan-
nels in the event of tobacco-growing be-
coming unprofitable.”
R. S. Moulton is a new one to the
“Wild Cat,” which thus far has been able
to keep track only of E. S., R. C. and
W. J. Moulton. R.S. signs his gloomy
message on July 31, exactly 30 days after
the prospectus carrying the names of
E.S. and R.C. went forth declaring that
“there is probably no material, not even
gold itself, which has a future value more
assured than tobacco.”
Debenture-holders in the National
Tobacco Corp. were called together on
August 21. They refused to forfeit their
mortgage rights in favor of preference
shares until a balance sheet of the
Tobacco Corp. was shown to them. They
would be well advised to keep in mind a
few facts at the next meeting. As de-
benture-holders they should have a prior
claim over both creditors and share-
holders, and their -interest should be pay-
able whether earned or not. The fact
that scarcely any profit was earned to
June, 1932, indicates how they would
have fared as preference shareholders.

About six years ago the Mercantile sold
its old headquarters freehold in Martin-
place, Sydney, to the Colonial Mutual
for £250,000, and invested the proceeds
and more besides in fine new pre-
mises round the corner in Pitt-street.
At June 30 the co. had £413,337 (= 51
p.c. of balance-sheet total) invested in
freeholds, and £397,164 in other securi-
ties and cash ; seven years earlier pre-
mises represented only 39 p.c. of the
aggregate balance-sheet items:

Premises are well tenanted, but owing to
legislative cuts, interest and rents turned
in only £20,093 (= 5 p.c. on capital)
last term as against £29,897 in 1930.
Slump brought such heavy evaporation
of insurance values that it has been im-
possible to get exes, back in proportion
to the drop in premium income. The
result of last year’s underwriting was
a loss of £778, compared with losses of
£9498 and £32,952 for the two preceding
years and profits of £9861 and £19,279
for the two years before that. Thus the
business as a whole showed a net profit
equal to 4.8 p.c. on capital as against
3.8 p.c., a loss (£4053), and then profits
of 9.9, 11.9, 12.6 and 15.2 p.c. back to
1927. The div. was lifted a point to
4 p.c.; it averaged a wink under 10 p.c.
for the decade to the close of accounts
in 1930, and 15 p.c. for the 10 preceding
years.
Underwriting performances, upon
which dividend prospects largely depend,
have behaved in this way since the be-
ginning of the century:

The co.’s withdrawal from the unsatis-
factory London marine market and
shrinkage in motor-car and workers’
compensation business have been largely
responsible for the contraction of
£129,490 in net premiums over the last
three years. The withdrawal is again
reflected in the drop in the loss rate ;
but exes, are difficult to curb.
The market, however, notes the im-
provement in figures ; notes also that the
co. enjoys a high reputation, built up dur-
ing more than half a century’s careful
trading, and that £152,250 of its £400,000
of capital has been transferred from re-
serves (now £209,294). It therefore prices
the pound shares paid to 16s. at 18s., as
against 12s. 3d. in May, 1932. The in-
vestor at 18s. gets an immediate return
of 4.4 p.c. on a 4 p.c. div. basis, with
prospects. The cover is 245. 4d. in net
tangibles.

The old Collins-street lease expired
about seven years ago, but despite ner-
vousness on the part of some share-
holders the business was successfully
transferred to new premises in Little
Collins-street, the leasehold portion now
having 58 years to run. The new nine-
storeyed building, with a cafeteria and
accommodation for 800 guests, was not
large enough to cope with business last
year. The quick-lunch service was a
valuable contributor to earnings. Gross
profit responded, moving up £8992 dur-
ing the twelvemonth:

Exes, were kept within £1127 of the pre-
vious year’s outgo ; thus the net result
(£20,929) mounted £7865, being equal to
11.9 p.c. on capital, compared with 7.4,
8.3, 15.1 and 17.4 p.c. back to 1929. The
div. was raised to 10 p.c., and £3329
was carried to reserves (£77,651).
In order to cope with business, which
is expected to be further stimulated by
the centenary celebrations, the board
proposes to build the centre block (free-
hold) to a height of eight floors and to
unify the three separate buildings. The
alterations are expected to cost £BO,OOO,
which it is intended to finance by raising
a mortgage of £50,000 and issuing
35,200 new 10s. shares, at a premium
of 55., to those on the register in the
proportion of one for ten. The esti-
mated benefit to net earnings is put at

The enlarged mill worked full time dur-
ing the year, and the co.’s products found
a fairly ready sale, in spite of keen com-
petition in the woollen section. The
tweed and worsted markets are not so
overcrowded. After valuing stock (cost
price, less depreciation provision) at
£14,464 higher, manufacturing profit, etc.
(£14,970), was £4222 stronger. Then,
transferring an extra £SOO to taxation re-
serve, the net result was £2688 better at
£5960. A bonus of 1 p.c. was added
to the 5 p.c. div., and £2OOO (shown as
written off in the table) was carried to de-
preciation reserve (£6000). The general
reserve figured at £16,080 when the
accounts closed.
Manufacture is carried on at Ipswich,
where a wide range of woollen textiles
is produced. There have been extensive
additions to the plant lately in order to
cope with the demand, particularly for
worsteds. In addition to the deprecia-
tion reserve already mentioned, other
provision is made for wear, tear, etc.,
on fixed assets; they are shown “at
cost, less depreciation,” and moved up
£5710 during the year:

Most of the increase was in plant
(£44,500). Stocks (£31,628) represent
£19,120 of uncompleted work and
£12,508 in the warehouse. Book debts
(£9978) dropped £3861. The debt
(£12,831) moved up £6290 ; mainly be-
cause of the factory additions the more
or less liquid surplus (£34,161) was £2895
lighter.
The directors say that all known con-

The outlook is brighter than the last
line in the table suggests. Rent-collec-
tions and the letting of trust properties
are improving, and fewer mortgagors
are unable to meet their obligations, says
the chairman. Also, prices generally
have strengthened, and there was a net
growth of £1,546,332 in the volume of
trusts on the books at June 30 com-
pared with a year earlier. Yet the in-
come of this, Australia’s greatest trustee
co., fell away £B4O during the twelve-
month—interest and rent-reduction legis-
lation operated for only portion of the
previous year:

Thus the bigger business was handled at
£3BB less cost than the previous year’s,
notwithstanding the extra burden that
financial-emergency legislation and taxa-
tion threw upon the co. Taking into the
reckoning a net addition of £4554 to the
commission reserved account (£101,518
—it is the unearned portion of the corpus
commission) and a reduction of £297 in
the premises-renewal reserve (£990), the
net result was £1426 lighter at 10.3 p.c.
on capital as against 11.1, 12.7, 18.9,
19.8 and 19.2 p.c. back to 1928. The
div. was kept at 7 p.c. ; it had been
steady at 12£ p.c. for the 12 years to
the close of accounts in 1930. Still, with
the lift in prices and promise of a little
relief in taxation, prospects of something
better than 7 p.c. are encouraging.
Because of this and the fall in interest
rates, the market price of the £lO shares
paid to £2—-the other £8 includes £5
callable only in the event of liquidation
—advanced from 625. 6d. to 745. over
the last 12 months. At the higher figure
the return is 3.7 p.c. on a 7 p.c. div.
basis. Thus the investor who looks for
a shade under 5 p.c. on his money counts
on a 9 p.c. div. To pay 9 p.c. on capital
alone, shareholders’ funds (capital and
reserves combined) need net only a shade
over 4 p.c. ; and that is leaving returns
from the trustee and agency section,
growth of which can be expected to con-
tinue, out of the reckoning altogether.
Including the fidelity reserve (£10,000),
there was £247,260 visibly assisting the
£200,000 of share capital at June 30. The
lot, together with £5039 coming to credi-
tors, was invested - in freehold, etc.,
£115,000; mortgages, etc., £153,445
(down £8620); Consols, £129,034 ; cash,
£57,307 ; book debts, £5513.

Mortgages are given first place amongst
the co.’s advances (£257,175, down
£10,589 last term), but the pawnbroking
business was extended last year, a second
branch being opened in Melbourne, and
the three-ball sign was hung outside the
Brisbane branch. The N.S.W. Mora-
torium has affected interest earnings and
realisation of some securities, while de-
preciation in values has brought about
losses on others. The co. is established
in Sydney, Parramatta, Newcastle, Cess-
nock and Wollongong (N.S.W.), and Mel-
bourne and Brisbane. In 1931 £SOOO was
visibly struck off advances, and another
£7OOO was taken from reserves in 1932.
Interest, rents and profits from
branches (£24,570) brought in £1471
more last term, after making “ample pro-
vision for slow and inoperative accounts
and bad and doubtful debts.” The im-
provement was most marked over the
last few months. Still, last year’s gross
earnings were equal to little more than
two-fifths of the 1930 figure. The slide
has been mainly due to a proportion of
the interest being treated as irrecoverable,
a more cautious lending policy, and in-
terest-reduction. Exes. (£17,193) were cut
back £lOl3 ; the net result was £458
better at £7377, but the 2\ p.c. handed
to shareholders called for £123 more than
that. Visible reserves (£37,271) are not
much help for capital.
With £10,589 less out earning interest,
the slight recovery in net earnings sug-
gests fewer bad debts:

On making old age
COMFORTABLE
TWO widows. One, 62 years of age, compelled to work in
other people’s houses to keep body and soul together. The
other, same age, happy in her own home with an income
enough to keep her in comfort and contentment.
The difference? Merely that the husband of the one spent all
he earned, whereas the husband of the other became a member
of the A.M.P. and put his savings into one, then two, and then
three A.M.P. policies.
For hundreds of thousands of widows membership of their
husbands in the A.M.P. has meant comfort in their old age.
Every young wife in the land should see that her husband
becomes a member of the A.M.P., so that both of them may
have comfort and security and peace throughout their lives.
“Investing in Happiness,” a new book recently issued by the
Society, shows how easy it is to make old age comfortable
through the A.M.P.. Send for a copy. It is free to all. Better
still, ask the nearest A.M.P. representative to call and explain
how the Society, “one of the greatest financial institutions in
the world,” with £90,000,000 of assets, helps its members.

Mount Isa
Isa’s accounts to June 30, 1932, were
not completed when the annual reports
were issued last November. In the in-
terim the figures have been submitted to
the co.’s technical engineers abroad, who
apparently had the final say in the appor-
tionment of expenses between production
and construction. The figures cannot be
readily digested by shareholders without
the explanation recently given in Bris-
bane by one of the co.’s London direc-
tors. Why this explanation was omitted
from the accounts is not clear.
The sheet shows a loss of £37,818 ;
the public announcement was that ex-
penditure exceeded revenue by £326,000.
The difference is apparently explained by
the fact that “it was decided to debit
against the limited quantity of metal pro-
duced only such an amount as was esti-
mated would be the expenditure per ton
under normal operations.” During the
year £171,419 was spent on plant con-
struction. Whilst this was going on
454,604 tons of ore (assay, lead 10.7 p.c.,
silver 5.50 z. per ton and zinc 4.1 p.c.)
was milled. From the resultant concen-
trates 38,008 tons of silver-lead bullion
(assay, 99.5 p.c. lead and 52.70 z. silver
per ton) was produced. The revenue
from this was £722,382, equal to £l9 per
ton of bullion. The cost of producing a
ton of bullion was as follows:
Mining, smelting and realising .. £l4 3 6.5
Commissions, etc. . . . . . . 4 3.3
Administration .... .. 8 5.9
Debenture interest, etc. .. .. 5 3 8.4
£2O 0 0.1
If an expenditure of £287,873, added to
prospecting and development account,
had been charged against bullion, the
cost of production would be raised to
£27 11s. sd. per ton. This is obviously
a much higher production cost than can
be expected when the mine is working
under normal conditions. The difficulty
is to determine what is normal these
days. On the basis of recent figures, Isa
is capable of turning out nearly 60,000
tons of bullion annually, whereas dur-
ing the period covered by the accounts
only 38,008 tons of bullion was pro-
duced. Mill recoveries (80.1 p.c. of the
lead and 77.1 p.c. of the silver) are also
likely to improvement sooner or later.
The reports and accounts to June, 1933,
will give a better idea of what Isa is
capable of doing under pressure of low
metal prices.
Under a scheme embracing, amongst
other things, removal of the head office
to Brisbane, the principal debenture-
holders have agreed to defer redemption
of their paper for five years. The arrange-
ment is chiefly of interest to the small
shareholders, who at one time seemed
to risk the loss of their interest.
Gold
The London price of fine gold aver-
aged £6 3s. lljd. an ounce in July;
the figure advanced sharply to £6 9s.
4yd. on August 27; it reached £6
10s. Byd. on Sept. 1. One result has
been a rush for gold scrip, the price of
which has advanced sharply on Austra-
lian ’Changes, as the following table
shows:

London supported the Australian market
for the scrip, too. *The rise in the price
of the metal is attributed to the with-
drawal of support for sterling by those
in charge (the British Treasury and the
Bank of England) of the Exchange
Equalisation Fund. Details of the opera-
tion of this fund are not made public.
Broadly, its function is to act as a buffer
against influences likely to cause either
undue appreciation or depreciation in
the exchange value of sterling, apart
from any normal tendency. The diffi-
culty is to determine to what extent
“bear” speculations as distinct from ordi-
nary trade transactions are responsible for
the depreciation of sterling. The flight
of American capital into francs and Euro-
pean hoarding of the metal are certainly
influencing the position. This may send
the price of gold higher still; where
the price will come to rest depends
largely upon the level at which curren-
cies are ultimately stabilised.
Tin
The following table shows the im-
provement in the statistical position of
tin on the London market at the end of
August for the last three years:
„ V , . ..., .. 1933. 1932. 1931.
Total visible supplies . . 32,854 46,551 50,914
Deliveries for consumption 11,772 5 576 8,590
Supplies during the month 7,190 3*552 8,103
There has been little alteration in the
figures since January. Visible supplies
include the pool holding of 21,000
tons, but not the Straits carryover —
7163 tons at June 1 as against' 10,333
tons at Jan 1. No sale of tin held by the
pool was to be permitted until the
national quota reached 40 p.c. or more
of the standard 1929 tonnage, though
in some quarters it is thought that this
part of the restriction scheme may have
run out at the end of June last.
The market for Bulolo Deposits
eased from 2s. lid. at the beginning of
August to Is. 9d. at last week-end, de-
spite the rise in the price of gold. It
looks like another case of plant ahead of
development. The “Wild Cat” would
not be surprised to learn that some of
the leases are worthless as commercial
propositions.
* He $ *
At the 300 ft. level, Mt. Coolon (Q.),
appearances were that the lode would
live to depth. On the 450 ft. level, how-
ever, developments continue to disclose
unpayable material; so the ore-body is
to be tested at greater depth by a
diamond-drilling campaign before further
shaft-sinking is proceeded with. Mining
and milling operations are proceeding
smoothly, and working costs are being re-
duced. On the basis of present output,
enough payable feed is in sight to keep
the mill going for over two years.

Mining engineer F. D. Gipps is car-
rying out extensive prospecting work
on behalf of Commonwealth Mines Pre-
liminary Syndicate (London) on its
15,000-acre concession on the old Gil-
berton goldfield (N.Q.). The late B.
Dunstan, one-time Queensland Govern-
ment Geologist, who inspected the area
last year, said there was at least
20,000,000 c.y. of gravel suitable for
sluicing. Much of the ground was
worked by Chinese in the ’eighties. The
concession includes Commissioner’s Hill,
where a lot of gold was won in the early
days.
“Ex-P.”: At the old Seven Mile Dig-
gings, Nanango (Q.), where much allu-
vial was won about 65 years ago, a
number of sluicing plants are being in-
stalled. Up to 1900, when the place
was abandoned, some £25,000 worth of
gold had been won, chiefly by Chinese.
Old hands contend that there are some
big reefs to be discovered in the district.
* * * *
On the Crescent leases, May Downs
(Q.), the shaft has been continued to the
80ft. level. Leaders encountered have all
passed out of the shaft with a strong
easterly dip. An assay of 35 samples,
taken over of the reef at the 45ft.
level, shows an average of 18dwt. lOgr.
per ton. A grant of £lO7 has been made
in order to sink the main shaft to the
100 ft. level to prove the show.

Hercules, Bendigo, has paid 30s. ( =
£90,000) per share since the new reef was
discovered in June, 1932, and another
2s. is to be handed out next week.
The mine looks good for another 18
months at least, though values may ease
a bit. Still, there is a lot of unproved
ore north of the winze, some of which
is known to be highly payable. The
shares (paid to Is.) are fairly steady
around 41s. 6d. on the market.

Ironbark, Bendigo, has sunk its shaft
another 200 ft. at an average cost of £8
10s. per foot. The idea is to crosscut
at 1428 ft. and 1528 ft. in the hope of
striking the continuation of the rich
shoot from the Hercules. There is still
some stone on the 1196 ft. and 1237 ft.
levels to be taken out. The directors
have been given authority to let portion
of the mine on tribute.

Davyhurst (W.A.) has attracted about
60 men. On the North Pole a party
is crushing 9dwt. ore, while a new ore-
body has been struck by the drill on
the Callion mine, under option to the
Enterprise, of Adelaide. The Lights of
Israel is being worked under Govern-
ment subsidy, and lOdwt. values have
been located.
* * ' * *
North Wiluna, which includes the old
Dark Horse, is under option to Gran-
ites Development; it is about three miles
north of Wiluna and the Moonlight
leases, has been unwatered, and 10,000
tons of lOdwt. stuff is said to be ready
for stoping. The market awaits a bulk
crushing and further development.

SHADOW SHOWS.
“Midnight Mary,” at the Regent, is a
gangster with some new twists. Loretta
Young is disclosed waiting for a jury’s
verdict in her lawyer’s room. As she
looks at his law-books, with their dates,
her life flashes through her mind. Her
childhood in a slum. Her first convic-
tion. Gaol. Unemployment. Luxury, as
the mistress of Ricardo Cortez, gangster.
Her meeting with Franchot Tone, lawyer
and man of fashion, and the birth of a
Great Love.
Cortez goes out after his rival, but
bumps off Tone’s wife’s lover instead.
He thinks he has killed Tone, and there
is a tense scene when he tells Loretta
and watches her face for signs of distress.
As she has only just left Tone, she is
relatively calm. When Cortez discovers
his error, and sets out to rectify it, she
shoots him.
She comes out of her reverie to hear
the verdict, which is “Guilty.” The Judge
is about to perform his distasteful duty
when Tone rushes in. New evidence!
The Court learns for the first time why
Loretta exterminated Cortez. Acquittal.
Rejoicings. Marriage-bells.
Loretta Young is creditable up to the
stage where the audience is asked to
believe that, after 14 years of crime, she
is capable of turning saint, and looking
younger and less ravaged than most
debutantes. Cortez is the perfect Big
Shot, as usual; and Warren Hymer and
Una Merkel play up to him on familiar
lines.
In “I Loved You Wednesday” Elissa
Landi is a dancer who is dropped by her
first lover, and is wooed later by Warner
Baxter. The first man turns up again and,
after a little philandering and floods of
mostly dull talk, she chooses Baxter.
Miss Landi overacts more than usual —
her features are never still—and the
photographer has treated her badly in
several of the shots. Her Parisian ad-
mirer is awful, and Baxter has a futile
part. The most interesting sequences are
those which show a dam being built in
South America.

So long as Eddie Cantor is fooling or
the ballet is doing its stuff “The Kid from
Spain,” at the State, is good entertain-
ment. At other times it is boring.
Eddie and his friend Robert Young are
expelled from college. Robert is from
Mexico and offers to take Eddie there,
but Eddie gets mixed up in a bank rob-
bery. He arrives in Mexico as a fugitive
from justice, and to escape the detectives
poses as the son of an eminent Spanish
bullfighter. The bullfight in which Eddie
is opposed to the fiercest bull in Mexico
is as funny as anything yet done on the
screen. Eddie has plenty of opportunities
to produce his brand of comedy, which
consists in looking supremely miserable ;
and he croons a number of catchy songs.
“Ann Carver’s Profession” reveals Fay
Wray as a famous lawyer. She and her
husband, Gene Raymond, have drifted
apart. He gets more and more dispirited,
and at last falls so low as to become a
crooner in a night club. Then he gets
entangled with a girl and, when she is
found dead, ho is arrested for murder.
Fay defends him But why say more?

In “The Rebel,” at the Capitol, Luis
Trenker is chased over at least 23 kilo-
metres of his native Tyrol by Bona-
partist troops, four peaks being scaled in
the process. Tyroleans can properly be-
long to so many nationalities that it
doesn’t seem to matter a hoot what
Mittel European language they “oliatee”
in, and exactly what nation Trenker was
defending is left obscure. Judging by his
technique, which is mostly a matter of
child-like confidence in his own charm,
he is a Viennese. Vilma Banky, who
“comes back to the screen” for this opus,
doesn’t seem to feel that charm, for she
acts rather more mechanically than she
ever did before. But the romantic story
these puppets illustrate is constructed on
sound lines, and a musical background
tinctured with Chopin, and some wonder-
ful mountain scenery, help to make it
tolerable.
“Trailing the Killer” is preluded by a
stage performance in which Caesar, an
Alsatian, demonstrates that the breed can
be very highly disciplined. In the talkie
Caesar (stage-name Lobo) is accused of
sheep- and man-killing and is hunted
with horses, guns, traps and hounds.
The scenario isn’t new, but the principal
actors —Caesar, a bitch of his breed, a
litter of their pups, pumas young and
old, lobsters, toads, rattlesnakes—put on
a show that commands admiration from
anyone who has an inkling of the
patience and skill, human and canine,
involved in its making.
The celebrated howl is absent from
“The Face at the Window,” at Sydney
Haymarket, and the corpse is no longer
blasted into activity by electricity, because
all the “improbabilities,” says the press-
sheet, “would not be tolerated by
audiences of to-day.”
The main excitement concerns the at-
tempts of the Great French Detective
(Raymond Massey) to sheet home mur-
der and robbery to one of three —a bank
manager (A. Bromley Davenport); a
blackmailing, heroine-pursuing Count,
and a bank cashier. Massey is assisted
by Claude Hulbert, more rabbit-like than
ever, and a doctor with gloves which are
proof against poisonous rings.
Tom Keene is one of those cowboy-
heroes who invariably pause in their
quest for murderers to bath and other-
wise mother waifs. Then they go forth
refreshed and get their men. Tom does
it all in “Renegades of the West.” The
film contains a likeable rogue, presented
by old-timer Rockcliffe Fellowes.

“Tell Me To-Night,” which is in its
fourth month at the Mayfair, is now being
assisted by “The King’s Cup.” Dorothy
Bouchier is being taught to fly by Harry
Milton, who hopes to win the King’s
Cup with his improved propeller. But
William Kendall, Harry’s boss, wants
Dorothy himself. He fixes things so that
Harry is without a ’plane on the great
day. Dorothy enters one fitted with
Harry’s propeller, takes him as navigator
and of course they win and live happily
ever The race, which takes up about
half of the film, is exciting.
FLASHES FROM SYDNEY FLICKERS.

Regent.
Sundry Shows
As a ballad popular with an earlier
generation declares, “So long as the
tune has a right good swing it doesn’t
much matter what words you sing.”
Similarly, when Dot Brunton is the cen-
tral figure of a comedy, it doesn’t much
matter what shape the plot takes. In
“Road House,” which opened at Sydney
Cri. on Saturday, farce and melodrama
are mingled so persistently that it isn’t
always possible to diagnose which is
intended to be which. Miss Brunton,
heiress to a village inn, and just arrived
in England from South Africa, becomes
innocently entangled in crime on the
way to take up her patrimony. John
Longden, policeman, suspects her, and
keeps her under observation, and John
d’Arcy, villain of the piece, sees to it
that incriminating clues are plentiful.
Miss Brunton’s breezy, cheery, Australian
manner has as foil various English char-
acters, notably three convivial sprigs of
the aristocracy impersonated by John
Wood, Frank Bradley and Leonard
Stephens. In the first act there is an
interluded glimpse into the past, in which
Miss Brunton, in leg-o’-mutton sleeves
and formidable coiffure, demonstrates
the technique of a barmaid of the ’nine-
ties —a little character sketch in which
there are many realistic touches. Dialogue
isn’t very sparkling at any stage of the
play, but it is merry enough. The Brun-
ton-Longden combination could make
an acceptable entertainment out of much
poorer material than it has to work upon
in this case.

At Sydney Royal “Music in the Air”
commences its last week. Madge Elliott
and Cyril Ritchard take the Royal stage
in “The Quaker Girl” on Saturday week.
At the New Tiv. Ella Shields continues
as the headliner of revues that are
changed every week. On Saturday night
at the Town Hall Peter Dawson makes
“his positively last appearance in Aus-
tralia” (a phrase that seems unduly pessi-
mistic), assisted by pianist Eddie Cahill,
sopranos Grace Simpson and Ailsa
Corrie, and flautist Leslie McCallum.
* * *
“Musical Chairs,” put on by the Inde-
pendent Players at Sydney Savoy, deals
with events on an oilfield in Galicia.
The plot peters out by the end of the
second scene, and the rest is sex-talk.
Eva Kuraz, as a Polish peasant girl, and
Arthur Stoyles, as an American go-getter,
provide the best of the acting.

Earlier suspicions concerning Steuart
Wilson were abundantly confirmed at the
Town Hall, Melbourne, last week when
the tall English tenor sang with glorious
ease and consummate understanding two
Bach cantatas as difficult as anything in
musical literature. In one of them there
was a sustained note that it might be
supposed only an organ could compass.
Edouard Lambert accompanied soundly
on the fiddle. Marshall Sumner, pianist,
obliged with a careful, if not inspired,
rendering of the Bach Partita in B flat.
A fragment from the “St. Matthew Pas-
sion” was another Bach item, in which
Wilson displayed his great dramatic
talent. The effect thrilled an audience
considerably larger than Saturday’s.
Vaughan Williams’s clever settings to R.
L. Stevenson’s songs of travel gave Wil-
son an opportunity of advertising his
versatility.

The burden of the rest of Mel-
bourne’s Music Week was borne on
William McKie’s broad shoulders. A
daily organ recital drew a greater multi-
tude than usually digests its lunch at the
midday sessions. McKie made his
mighty instrument dance through pro-
grammes of English, French and antique
organ literature, but the daddy of them
all was naturally Johann Sebastian, who
put in a final appearance on Friday.
McKie’s renderings of the Trio in C
Minor and the Passacaglia, with their
startling transitions from sparkling shal-
lows to depths of oceanic proportions,
drew an ovation. A slight fog that
dimmed the refulgence of Music Week
was the absence of a symphony orches-
tra. This animal was last seen prowling
in the vicinity of the Arbitration Court,
but has since vanished. It is understood
that knight James Barrett is forming
himself into a committee to trap and
tame the creature.
“The Quaker Girl” is in her last nights
at Melbourne Royal. “2x2 equals Theo
Shall” will be the business at the Palace
for a short season only. Last week’s
bill will be next week’s at the Tivoli.

“Clara Gibbings” at the Garrick con-

Gregan McMahon, whose production
of Shaw’s “Too True to Be Good” was
an event in Melbourne theatrical history,
will unload “The Apple Cart” at the
Garrick on September 30. A week ago
this bubbling satire on every sort of
Government could have been described
as G.B.S.’s latest, but the inextinguishable
Irishman has just completed a two-acter
which takes three and a half hours to
perform. It is due at the Princess, Lon-
don, shortly.

Mostyn Wright, a Melbourne play-
wright, has suggested a list of Australian
dramas which might be unloosed on an
unsuspecting public during the proposed
centenary dramatic festival. It includes
George Darrell’s “The Sunny South”
(1884), Rolf Boldrewood’s “Robbery
Under Arms” (1894), E. W. Hornung’s
“The Duchess of Coolgardie,” Haddon
Chambers’s “Tyranny of Tears,” Louis
Esson’s “The Time Is Not Yet Ripe” and
Arthur Adams’s “Mrs. Pretty and the
Premier.”

“The Cardboard Lover,” making its
first Australian appearance at Adelaide
Royal, is entirely French. Simone has
divorced her husband, loves him still,
and to keep him at bay engages an eccen-
tric youth to pass as her lover. He,
already in love with her, earns his pay
enthusiastically, and is always on the
scene —which for the rest of the play is
her bedroom. (Wodehouse, as adapter,
has kept the English version quite in-
offensive.) The artificial and farcical
situations are deftly handled by Barraud,
quiet, strong (and not always audible),
and Harbord, cleverly erratic though
hardly the gigolo the author seems to
have meant. But the play revolves round
Isobel Elsom. Fine acting, almost pain-
ful, is the telephone scene, in which
Simone humiliates herself to tempt her
husband back —on his own terms. But
mainly it is brilliant comedy, on Marie
Tempest lines. Margery Caldicott has
the best line in the piece. Simone is
discussing her errant husband. “You
do think he loves me?” and the maid
replies scornfully, “Why should Madame
be the one exception to a general rule?”
* * #
Adelaide Repertory has given another
series of short plays (which audiences to-
day seem to like almost better than long
ones). The real Rep. touch was in an
American “Murder Trial,” in which the
accused is played by three girls side by
side, each representing one aspect of her
character. The gem of the evening was
Ethelwyn Robin as “the greatest living
woman scientist,” first in a reporter’s
dream and then in real life. But talent
is abundant; one of the best pieces was
played by a whole batch of newcomers.
The Palette,
“M.G.S.”: Arthur Streeton’s retrospec-
tive exhibition at Melb. Athenaeum covers
his Sydney Harbor period, his English
and his second Australian periods, and his
latest ultra-refined and almost etiolated
modern period. The first is a testimonial
to the rapture with which he submitted
to the warm stimulus of the Australian
sunshine; during the second he was
obviously under the robust influence of
Constable and Turner, and in the third
he faced problems of light and shade
with a considerable degree of courage
and self-confidence. In the last stages
roses instead of sea cliffs and mountain
ranges are the favorite subject matter,
and this should lead to a needed con-
centration. But the formalist has tri-
umphed over the observer, and the repeti-
tion of a tried convention is easier than
the vigorous reaction of the individual to
a direct impression. Streeton’s earlier
pictures tend to be criticisms of his later
ones.
“F.S.”: First mutterings of the storm
which is bound to break when the Felton
Bequest’s £30,000 Tiepolo and £26,000
Rembrandt reach Melbourne are already
audible. It is argued by dissidents that
the body should not send money abroad
at a time when the exchange is against
us and there is unemployment about.
Possibly they don’t know that Alfred
Felton decreed that one half the income
from his estate should be spent on pic-
tures, and the other half on Victorian
charities. Since its inception the fund
has disbursed £440,000 to chanties, and
has closed its fist in regard to its art
activities to such an extent that there is
£lOO,OOO surplus undisposed of.

ABORIGINALITIES
“Furneaux”: Just as the miasma of
the bodyline controversy is dissipat-
ing, there seems a likelihood that Aus-
tralia will be in worse odor than ever in
British nostrils unless the Federal Gov-
ernment intervenes. Certain venture-
some spirits in Melbourne are consign-
ing a large shipment of mutton-birds to
London, where they are to be offered to
the gourmets as “Tasmanian Puffin, or
Ocean Duck.” The mutton-bird, split
and pickled in brine, is much displayed
in Melbourne shop windows, though I
have never met a Victorian who had eaten
one. The only people known to dine
habitually on the oleaginous fowl are the
Maoris, and when they have been doing
so everyone coming inside a mile to
windward of them is aware of it. To
the nose and pplate of the non-Maori
scientific observer the mutton-bird smells
like a long-deceased whale. It probably
tastes like one also.
* * * *
“Tamboran”: Living on a plantation
in New Ireland, I had a couple from the
Sepik as houseboy and nursemaid-cum-
seamstress; and a cookboy from the
Ramu. One morning the couple arrived
looking downcast. “No more work along
"So sorry to be over an hour late, Torty; it was sweet of you to wait.”
"WAIT! I've been on my way home for an hour.”
house,” they said ; the cookboy had given
the girl what she called “marria.” On the
previous day she had run out of tobacco,
and the cook, an obliging lad, agreed
to end her some and went into the
kitchen to get it. The girl asserted that
he warmed it on the stove whilst mut-
tering an incantation over it, with the re-
suit that on smoking it she had imme-
diately became seized with such an infatu-
ation for the cookboy that she could no
longer think of her husband. Her hus-
band’s chief complaint was that he had
been kept awake all night by her calling
the cookboy’s name in her sleep, thus
adding insult to injury. The cookboy was
called in and denied having designs on the
lady’s affections. However, the injured
pair seemed to think the only possible
remedy was to remove themselves as far
as possible from temptation (for the wife,
at any rate), so, regardless of the incon-
venience caused, they repaired straight-
way to the plantation to cut copra and
nurse their grievance. About three weeks
later, to my surprise, the cookboy told
me the girl and her husband wanted to
come back. “But,” I said, wondering
how one expresses such things tactfully
in pidgin, “I thought you and she were
not friends.” To which he rather bash-
fully replied, “She’s stayed away now
and no longer thinks of me.” The spell
was broken.
* * # *
“Marsh”: “Murrungurry” (B. 9/8/’33)
is wrong in stating no Queensland shed
now shears over the 100,000. Among
those that exceed that mark are Terrick
Terrick, once owned by Carbine’s Donald
Wallace, Wellshot, Thornleigh and Thy-
lungra. These run from 36 to 44 stands.
On Galway Downs, out on the Cooper,
when there has been a good season, they
run a record long shearing, six stands
being considered sufficient to cope with
60,000 sheep.
* * * *
“Taniwha”: One of the most potent
legends in Maoriland concerns the whan-
ako spud. In all the potato-digging dis-
tricts, from Pukekohe (where Priminster
Massey used to sling ’em into buckets)
right down to Stewart Island, there is a
tradition that whanakos are imbued with
magic properties—that they grow larger,
suffer less from blight and take more
kindly to the native soil than any other
sort. The Department of Agriculture
had a go at some samples the other day,
and said they were either Brownell’s
Beauty (a standard Tas. variety) or some-
thing so near it that the difference didn’t
matter. That doesn’t upset the tradition.
Whanako means stolen, and it is on
record that the European potato wasn’t
on the menu in Maoriland until the white
man came. It is also on record that in
bygone days there was a leakage from
a sack of murphies brought ashore at
Whangara for the sustenance of a
whaler’s crew. The whaler came from
Hobart. Probaly the whanako resists
the local varieties of blight better than
others because it has been longer at the
game.
* * * *
“Bourricot”: If that Auckland donkey
race (B. 23/8/’33) had been conducted
according to the strict rules of the Don-
key Jockey Club, the race would have
been divided among the donks which
failed to leave the barrier, the one that
did go the course and is described by
“Asinorum” as the winner being in
fact the only loser. In donkey racing the
winner is the last in. To guard against
a bye being run, the owners or their
representatives are always up on the
other fellow’s donk, and are thus all out
to keep their mounts going for their
lives.
* * * „.
“Sunsetter”: Short-cutting across the
Westralian bush in my old car I got badlv
stuck in a blue bog. I changed to low
gear and the car sank to the running-
board. As it was nearly sundown a
happy ending seemed doubtful. I knew
that a good shove from behind, at the
right moment, would be helpful,’ but the
problem of being in two places at once
had me beaten for a bit. This is how
I solved it. First I dug the back wheels
clear and packed them with scrub rub-
bish. Then I cut a straight stick and
bound it to the ignition key so as to
make a sort of handle. To this I tied
one end of a length of fishing line. Then,
after setting the wheels, I started the
engine and, with the line in hand, dashed
round to the back, where my co-opera-
tion made all the difference. Just as she
“We struck wotter in the winze t’ bottom of the fower ’undred, cap’n.”
“Wha’s it like?”
“It do seem to be all conjaled.”
“Congealed wotter! It must be ice, Tummas.”
heaved herself out and the wheels
gripped firm ground I pulled the trigger
and cut off the spark.
* * *
“Myhree”: Ned Kelly, for all his
crimes, had a good name in the Greta
district (Vic.). My grandfather has told
me that the opinion in the district was
that Ned resorted to theft from the
settlers there only to assist him in evad-
ing capture. One morning he found in
his horse-paddock, in place of four of his
best hacks, four exhausted strangers. He
was perplexedly scratching his head
when he twigged a piece of paper flutter-
ing from the gate-post. It was a note,
and read “Dear Brown, I have taken
four of your horses, and left mine as a
security. You will get yours back when
I can manage it. N.K.” Twelve months
later my grandfather, by this time having
given up Kelly and become quite recon-
ciled to the exchange, found one morning
that the outlaw had been true to his
word, and had returned the borrowed
horses with interest—one of the mares
was strutting proudly with a foal at foot!
* * * *
“Wedding Guest”: Who is the ancient
mariner who says albatrosses are “never
seen to swim” (B. 23 /8 / ’33)? Writer
has done a fair
amount of seafar-
ing, especially be-
tween Australia and
the Cape, where the
wandering albatross
is seen at his best.
Time and again he
has seen the great
birds come down on
the water for jetti-
soned ship’s gar-
fa ag e and, after
swimming round
gobbling it down,
take clumsy flight
again, with feet flapping water after the
fashion of all big water-birds, including
our own black swan.
* * * *
“The Breaker”: As “Cooramin” (B.
9/8/’33) says, any chartered company
taking a slice of the Barkly tableland will
have as compulsory assets mobs of
brumbies. There will be plenty of
branded wild horses, also, most of which
will be wearing the late Paddy Lennie’s
brand. Lennie was one of the most
romantic of Territory characters, the
bane of station managers for years.
Owning no country, Paddy, with the aid
of a few blacks, roamed the entire
Barkly, chasing feed and water for his
innumerable horses, caring little on whose
property he grazed his mobs. Sell any?
Not on your life. The Public Curator
got rid of a hundred or two after Paddy’s
death in Darwin, and infuriated station
managers destroyed scores more, but
numbers still roam the Barkly, looking
in vain for their old boss,
* * * *
“Akeake”: The much-boosted model
pah at Rotorua (M.L.) is about the most
futile affair I’ve seen ; it bears as much
resemblance to one of Henare’s old-time
fortresses as does a goanna’s egg. Most
of the prominent features of the pre-
European pah are absent, and those that
have been incorporated in the design,
from the ridiculous gateway to the light
palisading, are mostly incorrect. Like the
Norman baron of feudal days, the Maori
had a flair, when constructing fortifica-
tions, for taking advantage of the con-
tour of the country. He preferred a hill-
top as a site, and made it well-nigh im-
pregnable by means of substantial ram-
parts, deep scarps, stout palisades and
heavy fighting stages, the last placed
with great tactical skill. Irregularity was
a characteristic feature, but the model
pah is distinctly regular. It might pass for
a crude representation of a post-pakeha
redoubt, and that it should be exhibited
to overseas tourists as a faithful repro-
duction of an old-time fighting village is
a gross libel on an intelligent race of

“J. 8.”: A sidelight is thrown on the
old coaching days by an advertisement
which appeared on an almanac dated
1834, and printed at Hobart Town. The
charges for the journey by the coach
rumbling from Hobart to Launceston
are given thus: “Inside, £l. Outside,
cash, 55.; credit, 155., and that only
to responsible persons.” That prejudice
against transport on tick persists. Last
time I was in Tassie anybody who tried
to get from Hobart to Launceston on
credit would have started something
serious.

“Kariah”: In the days of the construc-
tion of the Kempsey-Macksville section of
the North Coast (N.S.W.) line, Barangan-
yatti was usually called “Beer and go
ratty.” Probably the “rattiest” of the men
on the job, when drunk, was a teamster.
There was an attempt on one occasion to
put him on the prohibited list. He hitched
his leaders to one of the verandah-posts
of the hotel and, with whip poised,
shouted to the barman “Now, yer blank-
ety-blank, will yer sell me some rum?”
The lesser of two evils was chosen.
* * * *
“Frigid”: A curious egg was laid re-
cently by a hen owned by a poultry-
farmer at Coorparoo (Q.). On its shell
is marked a perfect replica of the face
of a watch. The Roman numerals are
complete, and even the minute divisions
are perfectly plain. The numerals and
divisions are raised above the surface of
the shell, and there is a deep impression
above the numeral XII, evidently cor-
responding to the winder of the watch.
Can anyone explain how such a thing
could happen?
THE EARLY SHEDS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The grass is green, the wool is clean,
The weather clear and dry;
And shearers line the river roads
From Bourkc to Gundagai;
While close behind are rouseabouts,
Bush cooks and station hands,
For soon the early sheds will start
And some have fifty stands.
Besides the billabongs and creeks,
As in and out they wind,
Are stringing flocks of bleating sheep,
With men and dogs behind;
While at the outposts of the run,
Where dancing whirlwinds spin,
Are shepherds riding far and wide
To bring the stragglers in.
The engine has a trial run;
The grinder tests his gear
And clears his bench of oily rags
Where they have lain a year;
The old shed trembles on its joists,
And creaks from roof to floor;
While startled swallows leave their nests
And vanish through the door.
Beyond the shed are swagmen’s camps,
With here and there a tent,
The nomad dwellers of the bush
Who pay no rate or rent.
Aloof, a few black derelicts,
.Sad remnants of a race
Slow drifting on to meet the end
That’s nearing them apace.

“Rapana”: Trouble about this theory
that Maori carvings of human figures
have only three fingers is that it isn’t true.
Tell “Wainui” (B. 2/8/’33) that the figures
on the meeting-house at Aotearoa, near
Te Awamutu, have four fingers and a
thumb. This house was carved in 1888
by the then oldest living Maori carver,
who passed on his art to Motu Heta,
who did the carving for the meeting-
houses at Mokai, Taupo, Waitahinui, On-
garoto, Owairakau, Ngaruawhaia, Patea
and one in Hawkes Bay. In each of these
every figure has four fingers and a
thumb. Motu Heta says he never heard
the “three fingers” tradition. The oldest
carvings of his people showed the full
hand, and he has followed suit.

“Homfrey Beale”: The kapok-tree has
its habitat among the rocky escarpments
of Queensland and certain parts of Cen-
tralia. When the time is what the poli-
ticians call ripe the wind scatters the
fluffy white down that encases the seeds
far and wide over man and beast. Days
"I aint’ goin’ to belt yer fer pinching the jam, but fer the careless way y’ve
left yer finger-prints about.”
upon days I have spent trying to rid
myself, horses and equipment of this
botanical adhesion, but only the patient
attrition of time can efface it. There is
compensation, however, in the bright
beauty of its masses of yellow blossoms.
The fruit, too, when open rewards close
inspection with a daintily-blended and
finely-shaded color-scheme. It is about
the size of a small pullet egg, and has
ten alternating sections of burnt sienna
(outside) and pale cream (inside), with
a sphere of dark-red seeds for centre,
swathed in the gossamer fibrousness
that causes the trouble. Old-time lubras
strung the seeds for personal adornment,
and bucks bespattered themselves with
the snowy fluff on ceremonial occasions,
more particularly those of totemic signi-
ficance.
* * * *
“Binghi”: The full-blooded Tweed
River aboriginal woman has passed for
ever with the death of Biddy Richmond
at the age of 83, or thereabouts. For
years she was the sole surviving female
of the Boggangar tribe, which claimed
from the head of the river to Chabow
(the headland of Point Danger) as its
patrimony. Only two male full-bloods
now remain.
* * * *
“Wai-hoi”: As one of the loneliest
species of birds in Australia I’ll enter
one of the superb warblers, the little
chaps with the sticky-up tails, Malurus
leucopterus, whose homes are on Dirk
Hartog Island, off Sharks Bay (W.A.),
and on Barrow Island, 500 miles distant
north-west. Jack Tunney, who nowadays
is a wheat-farmer down Kojonup way
(W.A.), in his younger days was collec-
tor for the Museum at Perth. In
1900, in spinifex grass, on Barrow Island,
Tunney got three specimens of a black-
and-white superb, which the late A. J.
Campbell, of Melbourne, scientifically de-
scribed as Malurus edouardi, in honor
of Edward P.’s royal granddad. Later,
Campbell found that he had slipped a
bit; the species proved to be M. leucop-
terus, that 77 years earlier had been de-
scribed by John Gould, his type being a
specimen from the island where the
Dutchman Dirk Hartog and his cobbers
scrambled ashore in 1616.
* * * *
“Speargrass”: On Calton Hill station
in the Cloncurry district (n.-w. Q.) there
is a salt reef outcropping for many miles.
It is only about 2in. wide, but pads
made by horses, cattle and kangaroos
lead to it from all directions. The salt
is licked out down to a depth as far as
their tongues can reach, and in places
brumbies have torn some of the rocky
earth away with their hoofs to expose
more of the salt reef.
* * * *
“C.P.C.”: A word or two about
pigeons. Three of the small fruit
pigeons, for beauty and delicacy of plum-
age, will take the three places among
Australia’s 800-odd birds. A rose-
crowned one, Ptilinopus ewingi, hangs to
the jungles in Kimberley and N. Austra-
lia, as well as those in Flores and Timor.
If you look hard enough during the wet
season you’ll find its pure white eggs on
a tiny, nest-like platform about six feet
above the ground. Round about East
Point, where Darwin Don Juans go at
night, is a favorite haunt of this secret-
ive little pigeon. It was given its name
by Gould after Padre T. J. Ewing, a
Tas. naturalist. In New Guinea and
Eastern Australia there’s a purple-
crowned cousin, P. superbus, whilst the
red-crowned, P. regina, fixes dates in
New Guinea, the Torres Strait islands,
and as far south as northern N.S.W.
Myristicivora spilorrhoa is the name that
the “white nutmeg” or Torres Strait
pigeon takes to bed with it. It comes
as a migrant to Australia for breeding in
September and October, and, that job
over, it pushes off again to the northern
islands in the following March. You’ll
get a shock if you try to cook this full-
breasted bird in the usual way. Boiled
only, you couldn’t harpoon it; ditto if
roasting is tried. But the dual process of
parboiling and topping off by roasting
makes it edible, though a bit dry. West-
ernmost point of distribution, as far as I
know, was when Price Conigrave’s party
got it at Admiralty Gulf, top end of
W.A., in 1911.
* * * *
“Searchlight”: Anyone remember the
old shark, Georgie Porgie, who used to
frequent the blood-hole at the abattoirs
on Glebe Island? The old chap did not
seem to trouble about humans, and the
lads swam quite near his haunts, but
DAD: “Gosh, lad, what’s happened to you?”
Dave (just returned from Sydney): “Aw, I got caught in one of them foldin’
beds.”
he was a devil on dogs. One Sunday he
took four in Johnstone’s Bay —simply
bit them in halves. One day a chap
seated on the ferry Annie, which plied
between Johnstone’s Bay and Erskine-
street, saw the old boy give a fisherman
sitting on the wharf at Glebe Point a
fright. The Annie was just slowing when
Georgie leapt and bumped his nose
against the fellow’s boot. The deck-
hands were emphatic that the shark was
only joking, as he could easily have
seized the man had he wanted to. Georgie
frisked away through the water and
swam around the steamer, evidently de-
lighting in the fright he gave the fishing
enthusiast. His sharkship came to grief
whilst asleep near Manly. The old Fair-
light caught him square amidships and
the old fellow died with a broken back.
* * * *
“Liebliche”: That yarn about skull-
collecting in New Guinea (B. 23/8/’33)
recalls an experience of an
old friend up that way in the
German days. He had made
a lot of money and was as
rough as bags, but that did
not prevent his marrying the
half-caste daughter of a Ger-
man beachcomber and set-
ting her up in one of the
finest and best - appointed
plantation houses of those
days, which was saying some-
thing. The country about
was still a bit wild, and one
day the father-in-law strayed
out of bounds and was killed
and eaten. In answer to his
bride’s entreaties, my friend
attempted to get some
souvenir of the old man for
her, but all he could manage
was his skull, picked very clean. The bride
set this up on the grand piano, which
neither of them could play, and wept
whenever she passed it, in spite of my
friend’s expostulations. One day he got
fed up. He took the skull down to the
middle of the lawn in front of his house,
put a stick of dynamite in it, and con-
nected up the battery he used for fishing.
Then he invited his wife and the entire
entourage to the front verandah, threw
over the switch, and sent papa’s skull
flying through space in infinitesimal
pieces. The lady took the hint. There
was no more mourning and she became
a model wife.
* * * *
“E.S.S.”: Monty Byrne, the black-
tracker who was attached to the Goul-
burn (N.S.W.) police, and who died the
other day in the Goulburn Hospital, had
a strange history. In 1878, two prospec-
tors named Harry and Jim Keyes were
working on the Queensland border. The
northern blacks were troublesome, and
to scare them off the brothers resorted
to the old trick of a lighted candle in
a melon-shell, with eyes, nose and mouth
cut in it. In their flight from the debil
debil, the mob left little Monty, then
about four years old, behind them. The
brothers took him to Gunning Flat, near
Cowra. In the train from Queensland
he was carried in a sugar-bag as personal
luggage, and cautioned to keep his head
in, which he did. At Gunning Flat he
was taken charge of by a relative of the
Keyes, named O’Leary, who had him
educated. His case is a reminder that
three other abos. who distinguished them-
selves were also found wandering in the
bush. These are Douglas Grant, who
was employed for years in the draughts-
men’s department of Mort’s Dock and
Engineering Co., was a sergeant in the
A.1.F., and later learnt wool-classing and
station-management under H. L. White,
of Belltrees ; David Unaipon, preacher,
scholar, inventor, philosopher and musi-
cian ; and the Rev. James Noble, who
was ordained at St. George’s Cathedral,
Perth. Douglas Grant, whose parents
were killed in a tribal fight when he
was two years old, was found in the N.T.
by Robert Grant, chief taxidermist at
Sydney Museum, while on an expedi-
tion to the N.T.,.and taken to Lithgow
(N.S.W.). Dave Unaipon, a member of
the Narrinyerri tribe, was reared and
educated at the Point Macleay mission
station (S.A.). James Noble was picked
up in the Normanton (Q.) district by a
drover, who took him to Scone (N.S.W.),
and he was educated at the Grammar
School there.
;J« %
“V.L.”: It was on a summer evening
at Beechworth (Vic.). Not far from my
camp was a patch of lucerne, to which
rabbits used to come. I sat watching
them hopping through the dark grass,
when a cat appeared from behind a log.
Her approach was the signal for the
rabbits to scatter, but she singled out one
and pursued it after the manner of a
greyhound, hurdling obstacles and turn-
ing and twisting, just as I had so often
seen dogs do. Pursuer and pursued dis-
appeared through a gap in the scrub. A
moment later came the squeal of a rabbit
in its death agony, followed by the spec-
tacle of Tabby, head carried high, drag-
ging her prey towards the log from be-
hind which she had first entered my field
of vision. Presently I saw her lying in
the hollow log, the rabbit skinned and
stretched before her, and half a dozen
greyhound pups wiring into it. I have
heard of a cat suckling puppies, but never
of one obtaining their meat supply in the
manner described.

“Herpeton”: That bright red snake
(B. 23/8/’33) is not so uncommon out-
back as “Sam” seems to imagine. Some
time ago controversy was raging among
the serpent experts as to whether the
brute was not simply the ordinary red-
brown snake which had taken on a
brighter color by reason of its environ-
ment, which is almost always the red-
soil mulga ridges ; and I fancy the brown
snake advocates had the best of the
argument. Snakes do change amazingly
in color according to the ground they
habitually live on, a fact often noted in
the same species found only a few miles
apart.
“Ida D.”: “Sam’s” red reptile reminds
me of a snake I saw in Java. Quite 4ft.
long, it was vivid green above and bright
scarlet underneath. With head slightly
raised and turned towards me, it was
slowly crossing a wide gravel path. My
shouts brought one of the “boys,” but it
had disappeared into a clump of bushes
before he arrived. A description of the
fearsome-looking beast did not perturb
him in the least, so I concluded it was
not uncommon.
HEADING ’EM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“At de luxe two-up schools, u big winner may
leave at any time; with a trusted attendant to escort
him if he feels nervous. No other player is allowed
to leave the school for ten minutes afterwards.’’
—Sydney “Telegraph.”
Back “Home” there’s never citizen
Of horse and hound a lover
But knows that ev’ry now and then
A fox is “chopped” in cover.
The timid hare may leave her form
In lonely moorside places,
And in a moment find a swarm
Of hounds upon her traces.
But in the joints that coppers draw
For floors with gamblers treading ’em,
They stoop to nought so rough and raw;
He always gets a bit of “law,”
The chap who’s won at heading ’em.
The pigeon rising from the trap
Has little grace allotted;
He’s scarcely forty yards mayhap
Away before he’s potted.
The gunmen whom you eye askance
Adown dark alleys flitting
Ne’er give their victims Buckley’s chance —
They’d sooner shoot them sitting.
But where the kip they swirl and sway,
And blokes with rolls are shedding ’em,
They’re better sports, you can’t gainsay;
He’s minutes ten to get away,
The bird who’s won at heading ’em.
The lucky book who’s skinned the lamb
When home at night he’s stealing
May carry in his diaphragm
An apprehensive feeling.
He knows not where the thugs and tugs
May lurk, his frame to chew up,
But no such surreptitious slugs
He fears whose game is two-up.
Though wolfish eyes watch him depart,
He’s little cause for dreading ’em,
For strike me pink! and cross my heart!
They give a cove a decent start
Who’s scooped the pool at heading ’em!

Subconsciously I sensed the prods in
the region of the spine that were being
dealt me by the man behind; heard
dimly his discourteous gruntings in re
my tardiness. But I was incapable of
motion.

was as carmine as the rose of love, her
cheeks wore the blush of an early peach,

UPPER HOUSE ELECTIONS.
Reports From Familiar Identities.
Period Piece.
By Ernie Fitz-Guff.
One had envisaged a preponderance of
Edwardian exhibits, but one hardly ex-
pected a host of Early Victorian ex-
amples. To cap it all a typical repre-
sentative of the Regency Era was wheeled
in as the proceedings began. And one
had been promised a Modernist collec-
tion!
The muted mistiness of “tricksy
Spring” was filling the chamber with
swift, slim shapes, all light and color and
sheer loveliness, as Hon. Jas. Boggle
arrived. One was reminded now of
Gubsack’s “The Imbecile,” now of Mal-
nutriot’s “Senility.” In the background
were a number of fashionables, the gay
textures of whose garments suggested a
three-dimensional painting by Cezanne,
or, alternatively, a naivete, and a concept
at once provocative and unique imbued
with the delicate and tender spirit of
Henri Rousseau.
And so, through the trembling half-
shadows, the Elder Statesman reached
out a palsied yet still, to all intents and
purposes, efficient hand, and grasped
Freedom’s most precious guerdon —the
ballot paper....

came a few months later
when Mr. Roosevelt made
it worth our while to burn

it really rich next year. It
took less than a month to

8 more. To the 16 is added 12 for the double
pair-royal, and “one for his nob,” making 29.
If the knave and start be of different suits,
the score is 28. With four fives in the crib,
and the knave turned up, the value of the show
will be 28 only, but the dealer will already have
scored “two for his heels,” so that the total
value is 30.

(1) Can magnetism be insulated ? (2) What
relation has magnetism to electricity ? (3) What
is the relation of magnetism to gravity ? —7661.
(1) There are no substances that will act as
magnetic insulators, but, by using iron as a
screen, it is possible to confine the path of
most of the lines of force to the metal, owing
to its very low reluctance, or high permeability.
(2) When a varying magnetic field cuts a metal-
lic conductor, a difference of electrical potential
is set up across the ends, and if the conductor
takes the form of a closed loop a current will
flow round it. Again, it is impossible for a
current of electricity to flow in an electrical
circuit without it being surrounded by a mag-
netic field, whose intensity will depend upon
the strength of the current. The flow of elec-
trons in a conductor sets up a strain in the
surrounding ether, or upsets its equilibrium. (3)
To the best of present knowledge a magnetic
field is unaffected by gravitational force, but
it must be remembered that light was believed
to be also unaffected until Einstein suggested
that a ray of light coming from a planet on the
opposite side of the sun, and almost 'behind it,
was slightly bent as it passed by the sun —a
theory that, on scant evidence, holds the field.
(1) Did any of the A.I.F. troops who were
aboard a troopship, outward bound, first time
overseas, on Dec. 31, 1915, receive the 1914-15
star ? (2) If any of them received it, why not
all of them ? —7555.
(1) and (2) To be eligible to receive the
1914-15 star, a member of the A.I.F. must have
disembarked, and been taken on the strength of
a unit in a theatre of war, on or before mid-
night, December 31, 1915.
In what year did an aboriginal team of
cricketers visit England from Australia, and
what was its playing record ? —7753.
In 1868, under the captaincy of C. Lawrence.
The abos. played 47 matches, won 14, lost 14,
and drew 19.
(1) When was the manufacture of pearl
buttons commenced in Australia ? (2) What
were the rates of duty at the time, and what
changes have been made since ? (3) How many
factories were there at the start ? (4) How
many now ? (5) Where can 1 get further in-
formation concerning details of the business ?
7710.
(1) February, 1931. (2) At that date duty was
5 p.c. ad val. British preferential; 15 p.c.
general. On March 27, 1931, rates were raised
to 30 p.c. and 50 p.c.; on June 4, 1931, rates
were altered to: Up to 20 line, per line per
gross, id. and Id.; ad val. 15 p.c. and 25 p.c.;
over 20 line, per line per gross, id. and Id.;
ad val. 30 p.c. and 50 p.c. On February 25,
1932, rates were altered to 15 p.c. and 30 p.c.
ad val. (present tariff). (3) One. (4) One. (5)

(1) In what year was responsible government
instituted in N. S. Wales ? (2) What form of
government operated previously ? —7759.
(1) 1856. (2) From 1788 to 1821 the rule
of the Governor was practically absolute, sub-
ject, of course, to the British Government
through the Sec. of State for the Colonies. From
1821 to 1842 there was a Legislative Council
of nominated members, and in 1843 it was made
up partly of nominated and partly of elected
members—l 2 of the former and 24 of the
latter.
(1) Who was driving the vehicle in Parra-
matta Park when Lady Fitzroy, the Governor’s
wife, was killed ? (2) What was the year ?
7745.
(1) No one was actually driving. The Gov-
ernor was about to pick up the reins when the
horses bolted, and his wife and Lieut. Masters
met their death when the carriage collided with
a tree. (2) 1847.
Was the Riot Act ever read in Melbourne ?
Year and occasion ? —7779.
Yes, it was read in Melb. during the election
day for the Parliament of 1843. There was
great disorder and much damage was done.
(1) Was Morgan the bushranger hanged or
shot ? If shot, by whom ? —7761.
(1) He was shot on April 9, 1865, by a
man named Quinlan at Peechelba station, near
Wangaratta.
(1) Name of the first foreign trading vessel
to arrive at Sydney ? (2) The name of the first
steamer from England ?—' 7776.
(1) The Philadelphia, U.S.A., brigantine, on
Nov. 1, 1792. (2) The Sophia Jane, May 16,
1831. She was intended for trade between
Sydney and Newcastle.
(1) What was the date on which H.M.A.S.
Australia left Sydney, after the declaration of
war, 1914, to search for German warships in
the Pacific ? (2) Where were the Germans
expected to be ? (3) Where were they actually ?
—7770.
(1) On the night of Tuesday, Aug. 4. (2)
Somewhere handy in the western Pacific. The
Australia, Sydney, Yarra, Warrego and En-
counter concentrated at Rabaul, but were dis-
appointed. (3) At the Carolines.
In weekly golf competitions handicaps are
reduced on all cards handed in with a score
below bogey. In the event of a tie, players
play off. If in that play-off cards are passed
in with scores below bogey, should the handi-
caps be affected ? —7669.
That is a matter entirely for the handicap
committee. It is immaterial whether the player
has brought himself under notice in a stroke
competition, a bogey or par competition, or
in a play-off of a tie.
Names and prices of any books dealing with
the management, training and breaking-in of
horses, and where procurable ? —7621.
“Veterinary Notes for Horse Owners”
(Hayes), 255.; “Horse Buying and Manage-
ment” (Fawcus), 2s. 3d.; “The Diseases of
Horses” (Dalziel), 2s. 3d.; “Points of the
Horse” (Hayes), 68s. 6d.; “Evolution of the
Racehorse” (McKay), 17s. 6d.; “The Thorough-
bred” (McPhillamy), 10s. 6d.; “How to Train a
Racehorse” (Muggridge), 255.; “Horse Keep-
ing for Amateurs” (Russell), 2s. 3d. All from
Dymocks, Sydney; postage extra.
Are the great pianists of to-day—such as
Paderewski, Backliaus and Godowski —superior
to those of the past ? —7278.
• A difficult question to answer, as there are
no sound-records of the dead pianists of the
nineteenth century. Sergei Rachmaninoff,
who heard both Rubinstein and Liszt,
said in 1923: “Anton Rubinstein played twice
as well as any who are playing to-day.” Other
eminent contemporaries of both Rubinstein and
Liszt have declared that (in Rubinstein’s own
words) “Liszt was the field-marshal; all the
others, corporals.” A good deal of allowance
has to be made for the mellowing effect of age
on memories. Pianoforte technique steadily im-
proves. The digital “miracles” of Liszt and
Thalberg are the commonplaces of conserva-
torium tuition to-day, and there have been
critics, old enough to make comparisons, who
have declared that the Beethoven-playing of
Backhaus and the Chopin-playing of just-dead
De Pachmann excelled anything in their memo-
ries, modifying this by the reservation that
'Paderewski in his prime was incomparable.
(1) What country in the world has the big-
gest libraries ? (2) How many books are there
in the British Museum library? —7ssl.
(1) Russia. As at July, 1931, the Public
Library of Leningrad was credited with
4,833,000 books and 331,100 pamphlets; the
Moscow Library contained 3,900,000 books.
France comes next with the Bibliotheque
Nationale, Paris, which has 4,000,000 books,
20,000 Chinese manuscripts and 125,000 other
MSS. (2) Like the others, it is being added
to daily. In July, 1931, it contained about
3,200,000 books and 275,000 MSS.
(1) Particulars of tin-plating process ? (2)
Cost of sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid and
caustic soda, and where obtainable ? (3) Cost
of a quarter ton of tin f.o.b. Sydney, and where
obtainable ?— 7526.
(1) The metal is “pickled” in hot sulphuric
or hydrochloric acid which has been diluted
by 16 parts of water to one of acid, after which
it is washed and plunged into baths of molten
tallow and tin. After the metal has taken on
a plating of the required thickness it is cleaned
with bran. (2) Sulphuric acid, 7s. 6d. per two-
gallon jar; hydrochloric acid, 10s. per two-
gallon jar; caustic soda, 10s. 2d. per 141 b.
tin, obtainable from Elliott Bros., O’Connell-
street, Sydney. (3) £291 per ton from F. H.
Booth and Son, Reiby-place, Sydney.
When Britain was at war with Spain in the
1790’s did privateers at any time take the seas
from Port Jackson against enemy shipping 7
7635.
Yes. Sydney was used as a base by whalers
turned privateer, and captured prizes were sent
in. Letters of Marque were issued by a Court of
Admiralty at Sydney in 1799.
(1) What was the name of the first vessel to
carry gold from the Australian diggings to Eng-
land ? (2) Names of the principal ships that
brought miners to the gold rushes ? —7620.
(1) As far as is known, it was the Phoenician,
of the Aberdeen White Star line. She arrived
in Plymouth from Sydney in February, 1852
with £Bl,OOO worth of gold. (2) The Great
Britain (then the largest ship afloat), Lightning,
Red Jacket and James Baines. The James
Baines brought 700 fortune-hunters to Aus-
tralia on one voyage.
(1) My finches mope about for a few days,
feathers ruffled, and then die. They are in a cage
15 ft. by B ft. by Ift. high in front and 6ft.
high at back, and are fed every morning on
pannicum and canary seed; milk-thistles and
lettuce every second or third day. What ails the
birds ? (2) How can female diamond and Java
sparrows be identified ? Any books on the
subject ? —7583.
(1) Treatment, diet and housing seem all
right. Probably the birds are infected by some
mite or insect. Thoroughly scald the whole
aviary with boiling water, then paint with kal-
somine. (2) The difference between the hen
and cock of the diamond sparrow is that the
hen. bird is slightly smaller and greyish in
color. The cock bird has a much more dis-
tinctive color. Java sparrows are most difficult
to tell, and the hen and cock can only really be
distinguished in the breeding season.
Where can information be obtained regarding
the growing of the cinchona tree in Queensland
and the production of quinine ? —7521.
The tree is not grown in Queensland. Its
cultivation, however, has recently been strongly
recommended, and the Department of Agri-
culture and Stock is making inquiries. Prac-
tically the whole of the world’s quinine supply
is obtained from Java, India, Ceylon and Mada-
gascar. The two species most commonly grown
are Cinchona ledgeriana (yellow bark) and C.
succirubra (red bark), but recently the Dutch in
Java have made some very promising crosses.
The finished product is manufactured at or near
the plantations. The cultivation, preparation of
the bark and manufacture of the finished pro-
duct are very complicated processes.
(1) Why is Stevenson’s “Ebb Tide” always
ignored when literary people talk and write
about R.L.S. ? Is it because of the collabora-
tion or because of the lack of merit in it ? (2)
Why has The Bulletin an antipathy to the
name “New Zealand” ? —7582.
(1) The novel is uneven, in part very good
and in part poor—a fault probably attributable
to the collaboration with Osbourne. Posterity
nrefers R.L.S. unadulterated. (2) The Bulle-
tin prefers “Maoriland,” for one reason, because
a tuie meaning “New Holland” is not appro-
priate to a country which the Dutch did not
colonise.
Has Galsworthy’s “Flowering Wilderness”
been published in serial form ? If so, when
and in which journal ? —7564.
Yes, last year, in “Scribner’s” (American)
and “Storyteller” (English).
(1) Is there any record of an Australian
“national anthem,” set to the tune of “Rule
Britannia” ? (2) Who was the writer ? —7638.
(1) Yes. (2) Robert Jenkins, a director of
the Bank of N.S.W., in 1817. The anthem was
sung at the first celebration of the anniversary
of the colony in that year. The first verse ran:
When first Australia rose to fame
And seamen brave explored her shore,
Neptune, with joy, with joy beheld their aim
And thus expressed the wish he bore—
“ Rise, Australia! with peace and plenty crowned,
Thy name shall one day be renowned!”
(1) Is it correct that in the 1800’y in N.S.W.
the Government provided a dowry for unmar-
ried daughters of prominent settlers ? (2)
What was the system ? —7628.
(1) and (2) Under the land policy of Gov-
ernor Darling’s Administration provision was
made (1828) for granting reserves of land in
this connection. Selections of large areas were
reserved for unmarried girls, and upon their
being wedded the deeds were handed to the
brides for their own benefit. Between Jan. 1,
1830, and Sept. 30, 1831, 29,600 acres were
thus donated. The Sec. of State then put his
foot down and some of the grants were can-
celled.
Who founded the Tate Gallery? Where is it
and what is it ? —7684.
It is at Millbank, London, and was founded
by Sir Henry Tate, who made a large fortune
in trade. The gallery, opened in 1897, houses
an art collection considered one of the finest
in Europe.
Where can I obtain information regarding the
discovery of the Liverpool Plains (N.S.W.) and
the first settlements there ? —7634.
There is a good short account in Favenc’s
“Explorers of Australia,” published by Whit-
combe and Tombs in 1908. Information con-
cerning the first settlement must be obtained
from histories of the various towns and also
of the A. A. Company. A pamphlet, “Quirindi
‘Herald’ Souvenir,” published in 1924, should
be useful, also an article in the “Journal of the
Royal Australian Historical Society,” vol. 9,
part 3, 1923, entitled “The First Decade of the
Australian Agricultural Co., 1824-1834.”
(1) Is the water in all artesian bores hot ?
(2) Why?— 7234.
(1) All artesian waters are either hot or warm.
(2) The heat of the earth’s interior imparts its
heat to the water beds. In Queensland the aver-
age increase in temperature is from ldeg. F. for
every 40ft. in depth in the south to ldeg. F.
in 20ft. in the north.
A husband and wife jointly own their home.
The husband dies and in his will leaves all to
his wife. Will the wife have to pay death duties
on this, and will it be necessary for the business
to be dealt with through a solicitor ? —7706.
Depends on the value of the property;
the widow will have to pay duty, Federal
and State, to the extent of the interest passing
to her if the net value exceeds £lOOO. It
would be advisable to have a solicitor.
(1) How many different routes have the rail-
ways had at Glenbrook (N.S.W.) ? Details ?
(2) When was the Lapstone tunnel built ? (3)
Was there ever a zig-zag there ? (4) Mileage
Sydnev-Batliurst by rail (a) when railway
opened, (b) 1908, (c) to-day ? —7559.
(1) Three: (a) Lucasville —Zig Zag. ( b ) Lap-
stone Hill tunnel deviation. (c) Glenbrook
gorge (existing). (2) Opened December 18,
1892. (3) Yes, until the opening of Lapstone
tunnel. (4) (a) 143 miles 78 chains, (b) 145
miles 1 chain, (c) 149 miles 6 chains.
What price was paid retail for Shell and
Vacuum motor spirit in 1916 to 1918 in Bris-
bane, and what was the duty during that
period ? —7532.
First-grade petrol to consumers ranged from
20s. to 28s. per case. Duty was per gallon
British preference, and Id. per gallon general
tariff.
(1) Who drafted the American Declaration of
Independence ? (2) Did George Washington
sign it ? —7739.
(1) Thomas Jefferson, whose draft was slightly
amended by John Adams and Benjamin Frank-
lin. (2) No. At the date of signature he was
campaigning with the Continental army, of
which he was commander.
v (l) Best time to strike rose and carnation cut-
tings ? (2) Are chrysanthemum cuttings taken
from the old wood or the young suckers ?
Length of cuttings, and treatment generally? —
7715.
(1) Rose cuttings should be put in from March
to June, and carnation cuttings at any time of
the year (preferably between June and
November). (2) Take stout cuttings about 4in.
long from young sucker growths, cut them off
under a joint and place them in prepared beds
containing plenty of sand. This work should
have been done in August, but if the cuttings
are helped by a covering of glass they will root
readily and be ready to set in the open garden
in late October. Be sparing with water and
manure in the early stages; let the young
plants grow sturdy. They will carry better
blooms in the autumn.

BALE WEIGHTS AGAIN.
“Murrawong”: “Sheepo’s” further re-
marks on bale weights (B. 16/8/’33) are
still unconvincing. He quotes obvious
principles which are taught to wool
students, and shows a lack of experience.
A bale containing 40 light-conditioned
fleeces will weigh less than one contain-
ing 40 heavier-conditioned fleeces, but,
supposing “Sheepo’s” presser, who seems
to have time to count his fleeces, puts
in 37 of the heavy variety, making the
same weight as the first, and brands both
PAAA.” The buyer has no time to count
them ; he glances at the two bales quoted,
placed side by side on the show floor as
representing one lot—and he moves
hastily on. Some woolgrowers want
their fleece to go at least 2501 b. per bale,
but where flocks are small and bins have
to be cleaned out each time, the first
owner must expect cut-out bales going
601 b. overweight, and the other people
will have several 801 b. to 1001 b. lighter
than the average. So if the broker shows
a light and a heavy bale together
“Sheepo’s” buyer will have to rise early
to get through his catalogue.
I would follow the example of
manufacturers who keep tab on their
packers by means of a numbered slip in
each package. It would be impracticable
to put the classer’s card in every bale,
but if all experienced classers were regis-
tered and their names or identification
numbers shown in the catalogue under
the clips handled by them, buyers would
show their appreciation of good work
and time saved in sampling by enhanced
prices. Japan would have less cause to
complain of the amateur who is respon-
sible for most of the trouble attaching
to the Australian wool trade.

deal to do with the future soundness of
the sheep’s teeth after reaching full-
mouth. In dry periods, and more especi-
ally in rough country, sheep become
broken-mouthed when aged much more
quickly than in good seasons, or where
the feed is soft. In some areas I have
seen eight- and ten-year-old sheep with
sound mouths ; in others, sheep four and
five years old have been practically
“gummies.”
Aged sheep need mouthing occasion-
ally. Only at odd times will they fatten.
Cull out all broken-mouthed sheep, irre-
spective of age, and get rid of them
before they die.
Graziers buy old ewes without troub-
ling to “mouth” them. They rely on
the seller’s statement that all their
mouths are sound. Inspect the mouths
of any sheep that look suspicious. If
you intend buying a line, insist on a
rejection of all broken-mouthed sheep.
Remember that the older sheep become
the less wool they’ll cut. One young
breeding ewe is worth three old “gum-
mies.” Old, broken-mouthed wethers are
worth nothing at all.
THE FERTILISER ACT.
“Chiel”: On the N.S.W. State Gov-
ernment’s business paper for this session,
but well down in the list, is a proposed
bill for the amendment of the Fertiliser
Act. This is long overdue.
The present Fertiliser Act (passed in
1904) is out of date and useless. Only re-
cently the Department of Agriculture
issued a warning to farmers against the
purchase of a material which “is alleged
to be guano.” In any other State the
warning would have taken the form of a
police-court summons, with a heavy fine
or imprisonment on conviction.
In other States the term . “fertiliser”
can be applied only to such materials
as contain certain specified plant foods,
either singly or in combination, but in
the Ma State any old thing can be called
a fertiliser, and any price charged.
MILK AND BY-PRODUCTS.
“Hatter”: A gallon of average milk
contains about l|lb. of dry matter con-
sisting of protein, sugar, fat and ash.
Separated milk contains about lib. of
dry matter and consists of the same sub-
stances as whole milk, minus the fat. In
whey, however, both the fat and the pro-
tein are eliminated; a gallon of whey
contains only about lloz. of dry matter,
composed of sugar and ash. A gallon
of whey can be brought up to the feed-
ing value of a gallon of whole milk by
adding l-31b. of oil and £lb. of protein.
A calf at birth requires about one gal-
lon of milk per day. For the first fort-
night nothing can adequately replace its
mother’s milk, but after that time it can
be fed separated milk with the fat defi-
ciency made up by the addition of
crushed linseed or cod-liver oil. At three
weeks a calf is capable of digesting
starchy food and can be fed on whey
with the following cheese-substitute mix-
tures: Beanmeal 5 parts, linseed cake-
meal 4 parts, ioz. precipitated phosphate
of lime. This mixture is used at the rate
of lib. per gallon of whey.
Dried separated milk, dried buttermilk
and dried whey are largely used in Eng-
land both for calves and pigs and have
the advantage of being available in that
form all the year round. One pound
of dried separated milk is roughly equal
to one gallon of separated milk, and lib.
of dried whey to about 1| gallons of
liquid whey.
CHEWING FESCUE.
“Minthall”: Graziers who have tried
it plump for Chewing Fescue. The
chewing kind thrives on heavy soils as
well as very poor light ones, where no
other grasses will thrive, and, besides giv-
ing good grass coating, binds and en-
riches the soil against the later planting
of other grasses that will not succeed on
the virgin ground. Fescue is a permanent
grass and feeds off very fairly throughout
the year, especially in the early spring.
Exhaustive tests in Maoriland on bar-
ren, useless country have proved that
after a few years it will carry all stock
well and, when other, balancing grasses
are added, produce extra-good wool and
flesh from hitherto waste country. A few
trials have been carried out in the colder
parts of N.S.W., and the graziers find a
marked improvement in their wool from
its use. It is a fine “bedder,” filling in
the sward among other grasses that are
light and spindly. Used among other
grasses, 31b. of seed per acre is sufficient,
while, alone, anything up to 161 b. is
wanted. A little introduced after clearing
in burn-outs, stump-holes or rabbit war-
rens will soon get it under way.
THE BUFFALO-FLY’S RANGE.
“Hatter”: Farmers in the south
are comforted to learn from C.S.I.R.
investigations that the buffalo-fly is re-
stricted by climate from operating below
southern Queensland in the east and
Perth in the west. The investigation
established that cattle in poor condition
are chosen for attack. A small parasitic
wasp, which feeds on the puparia, is being
bred to control the serious spread of this
pest. Meantime, the experiments are of
practical value as showing that (1) burial
of carcasses in the early stages of decom-
position favors the flies, but poisoning
with arsenic before burial gives protec-
tion ; (2) where traps are used, a solution
of sodium sulphide added to the liver
or other soup used not only adds greatly
to its attractiveness but renders the bait
more lasting in its effect.
COASTAL SALTBUSH.
“Mulyan”: Saltbush is our most valu-
able fodder plant because of its nutritive,
saline and health-giving properties and
its powers of endurance in heat and
drought. Sheep and cattle on saltbush
runs are free of disease. Stock which
have contracted ailments in coastal dis-
tricts have recovered in saltbush coun-
try. No salt licks are necessary when
these plants are included in the pasture.
There is a wrong impression that salt-
bush belongs to the dry interior. At one
time several species were plentiful in
coastal areas. Among these were the
coast saltbush, peculiar to the sandy sea-
shores ; the grey saltbush, which is ex-
cellent for binding loose, sandy soils ;
the staltwart-leafed, and two species of
creeping saltbush.
These stand close cropping and cut-
ting, and will grow anywhere but in
swamps. They remain green and succu-
lent in dry times. Sheep and cattle, if
allowed, will eat it right out; hence its
disappearance from coastal districts.
Creeping saltbushes are highly suit-
able for cultivation. They are deep-
rooted perennials, producing a heavy
crop of rich forage, which may be cut
three times a year, yielding about 15
tons. The croppings are unaffected by
drought. Saltbush has done well in the
Victorian Mallee country. A creeping
kind (A triplex semibaccatd) has spread
enormously under cultivation. This plant
is most worthy of dairymen’s attention,
both for grazing among other forage
plants and as a cultivated crop. Hay or
silage in bad times would save plants
from being eaten out in the paddocks. It
forms an excellent ration for milking
cows. Horses, cattle and sheep keep fat
on saltbush. It is easily grown from
seed. A few protected plants would soon
supply enough to spread it about the
paddocks.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Gumblegubbin”: Pine needles make
good nests for sitting hens. Resin odor
keeps lice away. Burn the material after
eggs are hatched.
“Horse Hoe”: A simple handle for
a file can be made from almost any old
bone, a flat one preferably.
“Eureka”: A length of old motor-tube
slipped over the blade of the scythe when
not in use prevents rust and accidental
cuts.
“Gardener”: Heavy rain tends to flat-
ten down the moth bandages on pear
and apple trees and enable the pest to
crawl over them. The bandage should be
like a cuff, so open that anything crawl-
ing up goes under the folded material and
gets into the cul-de-sac formed where the
material is tied to the tree.
“Bushman”: This is the time to top
and pollard ornamental, fodder and shade
trees. Much farm firewood may be ob-
tained at the annual lopping, which makes
the trees grow vigorously in the spring.
Make a sloping saw-cut, so that water
will not soak into the wood and set up
rot. First nick the bark under where
you cut and the limb will fall clean
away.
“Dimon”: Ships have boat drill, and
warehouses have fire drill; if settlers had
fire drill at the start of summer confu-
sion and havoc would be avoided. They
usually rush about, not knowing where
anything is. With periodic drill they
would know where to put their hands on
things, and the part each had to take. It
is important to know the best way to
defend the homestead. When the blaze is
coming a settled plan of action according
to the wind-direction might dispel the
danger of destruction.
“Curlew”: To destroy rabbits effec-
tively root out the burrows to a foot in
depth with a shovel, and a pack of dogs
will do the rest. In rocky or very diffi-
cult country two bad burrows to every
100 acres might be left untouched.
Muster the stragglers into these and fumi-
gate or ferret.
“Cloncurry”: Sheep yards are not in
working order until water is laid on. The
loss in wool value through dust and dirt
permeating the fleece makes watering
essential. It’s futile drafting sheep if
the forcing pens and drafting race are
of wire. Yards should be cleaned out
thoroughly and well watered before use.
Attend to drafting gates before the sheep
come in again. Have plenty of yard
space when drafting. Don’t burn can-
cered sheep in the yards; drag them
away, and don’t spare wood.
“Quack”: Spare-time raising of Mus-
covy ducks is profitable in W. A. A mincing
machine and a dolly-pot are the handiest
implements for the job. Feed them any-
thing, animal, mineral and vegetable, put-
ting it through the mincer, and feeding
raw with a little bran and pollard. This
gives the birds all the natural juices.
Chopped grass with pollard makes good
fodder; green maize better still. Keep
a bed of maize growing in summer. It
grows well with plenty of sun and a
little water, and the duck-pen will supply
the manure. Don’t soak stale bread, but
moisten and put it through the mincer.
Put green bones, soft enough to smash,
and charcoal through the dolly-pot. Bone,
green and burnt, supplies lime. By these
means feed costs can be brought below
2d. a week a bird, which, with 16 weeks
for fattening and a sale price of ss. each,
leaves a fair margin.
“Corriedale”: On breeding Corrie-
dales “Marsh” (B. 16 /8 / ’33) is wide of the
mark. The oldest breed existing was
founded in 1874 at The Levels Estate,
Canterbury, Maoriland, by mating stud
Lincoln rams to stud merino ewes and
inbreeding the progeny. In Australia
there are a number of Corriedale flocks
directly descended from these, and blood
lines have been rigidly adhered to since
the dispersal of The Levels flock in 1904.
Rams from these flocks have been line
bred, and are of 50 per cent, each Lin-
coln and merino blood. To breed up
a useful flock of dual-purpose sheep mate
them to first-cross Lincoln-merino ewes.
The resulting progeny and descendants
(ewe portions) can then be mated to
rams similarly bred. Corriedale wool
should be of 50-56’s spinning count,
not 58’s. No sheep other than merinos
will carry their wool in keeping with
their age as will those of the Lincoln-
merino cross.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
{Transferred from Service Department .)
(1) Has there been scientific and industrial
research to extract commercial oil from butter ?
(2) What results? —7653.
(1) and (2) Not so far as can be traced. The
manufacture of ghee for the Indian market is
receiving consideration. Ghee is butter-fat
extracted from the milk or cream by a special
process, solidified, and water to a prescribed
limit incorporated. Other uses of pure butter-
fat as a solid or in liquid have not been
investigated.
Method of preserving butter ? —7660.
There are two methods, neither very satis-
factory in hot weather. (1) The butter must be
made very carefully, and well worked to remove
all traces of milk and milky water. Hammer
it as dry and hard as possible with wooden
pats, and do not touch with the hands. Shape
up into pound pats, wrap in damp butter cloth,
and drop into a cask or earthen jar containing
a solution made by boiling salt in water, with
the addition of 1 tablespoon of powdered borax
to every half-gallon of water. Allow it to cool
thoroughly before placing the butter in it, then
store in the coldest place possible, covered with
a cloth. (2) To preserve by heat, clarify the
butter like dripping by boiling it with water.
Allow to cool, then remove the cake of butter
from the water, place it in a clean pan, and
bring up to boiling point. Pour into sterilised
hot jars and screw down. Store in a cool place.
1 am thinking of starting bee-keeping. (1)
What is a fair price for bees ? (2) Best time to
start ? (3) Where can I get further information ?
—7491.
(1) The price asked for colonies of bees may
range from 30s. to £3 each; much depends on
the class of hive material, combs and the breed-
ing of the bees. (2) From October to December
inclusive. (3) Get “The Beginner in Bee Cul-
ture,” Is. Id. posted, from N.S.W. Agriculture
Department.
(1) What is the method employed in caponis-
ing poultry; cost of an outfit and name of a
book on the subject ? (2) What is the most
suitable age to operate on (a) cockerels, (b)
drakes, and (c) larger poultry ? (3) How to
hybridise flowers for seed ? Any simple works
on the subject, apart from those written by
Mendel and Weissmann ? —7422.
(1) Instructions for caponising are supplied
with sets of instruments, obtainable from
Anthony Horderns’ for about 30s. (2) Time for
cockerels varies, according to sex maturity, from
nine to fourteen weeks. Drakes are seldom
caponised; no advantage is gained. (3) Flowers
are hybridised by removing the stamens and
conveying pollen from other flowers to the
emasculated parent. The pollen is applied to the
stigma of the emasculated flower and thus fer-
tilisation is effected. A simple work on the
subject is Bailey and Gilbert’s “Plant Breeding.”
I have an old apricot tree which blossoms
each year, but never bears more than half a
dozen fruit. What can be done to make it
bear ?— 7378.
The tree is probably a seedling, and it is
evident that it is unsuitable for the location. It
would be best to bud it with a better cropping
variety such as Trevatt, or, if desired, several
varieties could be put on to the old tree. A
bulletin on “Budding and Grafting” is obtain-
able from N.S.W. Agriculture Department, lid.
posted.
(1) What has been the price paid per ton to
growers in Vic. for sultanas during the last
three years ? (2) For currants ? (3) What net
profit do the prices represent ? —7585.
(1) For Two Crown fruit: 1930, £33 to £34;
1931, about £4O; 1932, not yet determined —
should be about £4O. For Three Crown grade
prices run about £3 higher. (2) For Two Crown
fruit: 1930, about £25; 1931, about £35; 1932,
about £32. (3) Cost of production must be
deducted, which varies considerably. It is
naturally higher per ton for a one-ton-per-
acre sultana crop than for a two-ton crop. The
cost of forking an acre of irrigated vineyard,
including interest, manure, harvesting, etc., is
between £35 and £45 per acre.
Best district to start a flower farm, having
regard to freedom from frost — or, at any rate,
severe frost — soil, suitability for roses, carna-
tions and all florists’ flowers ? Price of land,
and accessibility to my market, Sydney and
suburbs ? —7709.
For the Sydney market choose a district
where the freight charges will be light, prefer-
ably between Ryde and Hornsby or Lindfield
and Hornsby. Light, sandy loam will suit all
flowers. Violets, Iceland poppies, roses, car-
nations, stocks, snapdragons, marigolds, pansies,
asters, shasta daisies, dahlias, chrysanthe-
mums, heuchera, mignonette, nemesia and zin-
nias will find a ready market. Get in touch
with local agents. It is advisable to take an
extended lease if you are not purchasing the
property, since it will take a long while to
work up the garden and get results. Sydney
florists are always prepared to give quotations
for first-class blooms.
When to spray peach- and apple-trees ?
7609.
The N.S.W. State Entomologist advises that
first application should be given at least five
weeks before the fruit ripens, and repeated at
weekly intervals, five applications in all —an-
other, if rain occurs after a spray. The mixture
consists of 1 gallon of fruit-juice syrup, 41b.
molasses or treacle, soz. lead arsenate powder,
3 gallons water. Apple or pear syrup is recom-
mended for preference. It is made by boiling
51b. inferior fruit with enough water to make
1 gallon of syrup after straining. If apples
or pears are not available, peaches or plums
or citrus fruit may be used. The spray is
applied to two or more patches of the foliage,
at the rate of at least lOoz. per tree. Use a
pump or syringe or a large whitewash brush.
The fruit should be avoided as far as possible:
the aim is to apply the mixture in coarse
drops rather than a fine mist, so that the flies
can feed on it.
How to cure a bull of the habit of lifting
gates off their hinges ? —7536.
Quickest way is to dehorn him. If this is
not possible, a small hole could be bored in
the ends of each horn and a wire passed from
one to the other. From the middle of this a
wire could be attached to a nose-ring. This
method often has the effect of preventing bulls
from breaking fences.
My fowls suffer from swollen legs and feet
and are becoming lame. Cause and cure ?
7573. , . „
The fowls are suffering from “bumble foot,
due to flying from great heights when in heavy-
laying condition, bruising the pad, which be-
comes septic. Lance the pads to release pus and
touch with a stick of silver nitrate.

LIFE—A BUSINESS
It is a paradox, perhaps, that while Home Life is a refuge from
business, it is itself a business.
Money enters so largely into everything that it must be planned
for in every phase of life.
It is in business that money is earned, in the Home, chiefly, that it
is spent, and there is no sound reason why the spending should not be
regarded as being just as important as earning. In fact, it is far more
important, for earning is difficult, and must employ wisdom, forethought
and energy, while spending is easy, so easy that there is temptation to
spend unwisely.
Every Home, then, is a business, and needs an economic system, of
which the Savings Bank Pass Book can be the valuable basis.

MARKET SECTION
Wool and Optimism
It is no matter for surprise that the
results of the first day’s wool-sales in the
1933-34 season have been received with
a slightly inflated rejoicing. The increase
in values justified the prophets, and the
improvement has been decided. Last
year’s output was, of course, a record.
We cut 3,200,000 bales, of which
3,000,075 bales were sold in the Com-
monwealth for £34,410,321, which meant,
in Australian currency, an average of
£ll 9s. sd. per bale, or 8.9 d. per
pound, greasy and scoured. This year
it is likely that the whole clip will
be between 1\ per cent, and 10 per cent,
short of 1932-33 in weight, and Austra-
lian sales will probably aggregate
2,675,000 bales, much of which, by
reason of the nature of the season, will
show a greater proportion of fine and
tender wools and a greater bulk of dusty
backs than in recent seasons.
If sales were to average the same figure
per bale and bale weights were the same
average as last year the return from Com-
monwealth sales would be roughly
£30,675,000. To bring the national return
to last year’s total, the price will have
to be at least 12 per cent, more ; i.e.,
£l2 17s. 3d. per bale.
* * * *
Actually, indications are that the
margin will be wider. Estimaters de-
clare that, on the first day’s sale figures,
the rise should be worth £12,000,000 to
the country in wool alone, apart from
increment on stock and properties. Syd-
ney averages on the first day were £l5
16s. 6d. per bale, or 11.8 d. per pound,
THE CONTINENT BUYS OUR WOOL.
“Tenpence! ”
“Farthing ! ”
“Half! Half! Half!”
“Twelvepence ! Gone ! ”
which means that Australian sales should
bring in £42,352,000, if Sydney prices
become the Australian average. But
assuming even that there is no carryover
whatever at the end of the season —which
is highly unlikely—it would still be im-
possible to realise the gross figures from
wool of years like 1928-29 (£61,615,245),
or even the annual average for the five
years ending in the bad depression year
1930-31, viz., £51,274,108 —and this in
Australian currency, which is worth 25
per cent, less than in pre-depression years
for overseas interest payments and com-
modity purchases.
* * * * .
Before there is too much jubilation
over the figures, a few facts need to be
closely looked at. The grower has been
working with a yearly growing load of
taxation. He has had to weather three
years up to 1932 when, according to the
British Trade Commissioner’s estimate,
he received £82,393,000 less for his wool
than during the previous three years.
This was despite a steadily-growing out-
put.
* * * *
Secondly, though the rise is welcome,
it still leaves us 25 per cent, below
1928-29 levels at the very best. Thirdly,
while undue expectancy of wealth seems
to have been raised in the minds of some
daily press writers and growers, brokers
are careful to indicate (Winchcombe,
Carson were the first to say it emphatic-
ally) that the much-vaunted improve-
ment of 30 per cent, on Sydney June
levels and 45 per cent, on the opening
levels of last season was over very
moderate ranges of prices, even for such
bad times. *
* * * *
The new price is not so much above
Brisbane 1932-33 closing sales price—
11.18d. per pound.
* * * *
Wool, moreover, at 11.8 d. per pound,
is still unpayable. The Commonwealth
Wool Committee last year summed up
the expenses of an average property as
follows:
Expenses per Pound of Wool.
Working expenses (exc. interest) .. .. 6Jd.
Annual maintenance and av. drought
expenses .. .. .. .. .. 1 Jd.
Cost at station, excluding interest .. BJd.
Add av. interest at 5 p.c. on £3 per sheep
area (for wool only) .. .. .. 4Jd.
Additional costs to point of sale .. .. Id.
Rail, selling and handling .. .. ..Id.
Average cost per lb. when sold .. .. Isd.
* * * *
Costs have come down to a certain
extent since, but there is still a margin
of loss to be made up, and this can be
covered only by a drastic reduction of
charges. The committee recommended
a reduction of freight rates along the
lines adopted in W.A., which cut them
30 per cent., a substantial reduction in
Federal land tax or its complete aboli-
tion, and the maintenance of exchange.
But even this is not enough. Taxation
removed to the limit is the only measure
that will suffice.
* * * *
There are, too, honest doubts as to
whether the 25 per cent, exchange margin
is eternal. If, as some optimists believe, the
depression is nearly over, we shall soon
find out that it is not, much as it may
be desired to continue to hold up the rate.
The present 11.8 d. per pound for fleece
about which we rejoice would not sound
so cheerful in terms of sterling—at roughly
9.6 d. And a levelling up of sterling and
gold would make matters worse —in terms
of the Continental countries still on the
gold standard, our present price is the
equivalent of a bullion price of 7.46 d. So
11.8 d. at existing exchange rate has not
quite so sound a feeling about it as the
same price in, say, 1926, when the Aus-
tralian pound was at a slight premium
over gold sterling. The exchange posi-
tion cuts both ways. Naturally, with an
empty Continental European market, the
present position makes for wider buying
and buoyancy throughout the season. But
Continental advantage is somewhat bal-
anced by the disadvantage at which
Japan finds herself with Australian ex-
change 30 per cent, against her. So far,
however, she seems to be buying with-
out any qualms.
We must, nevertheless, be thankful for
small mercies. Dairy produce was as
much our mainstay during the bad times
as wool. The season 1930-31, in the
words of the Commonwealth Supervisor
of Dairy Products, was unique, and 1931-
32 was another good year in which the
realisation value of dairy produce was
£39,000,000—£10,000,000 more to the
grower than wool and £13,000,000 more
than wheat. The season broke the ex-
port record of the previous one by
270,000 cwt., and egg exports in the same
season increased by two-thirds. This
year it will be a sadly different tale.
Butter quality seems still to be declining,
and, if exports from July 1 to August
19 are to be taken as a criterion, it will
take more than Id. per pound on wool
to recoup the export-butter-return defi-
ciency. During these weeks the outgo
was 3313 tons against 8449 tons for the
same term last year. Victoria has
suffered most heavily. In such circum-
stances it is comforting to know that
stocks of both merino and crossbred
wool are very short indeed everywhere
and that prices are likely to be main-
tained.
Packing for Export
Edward Sassoon, a visitor from Java
and a member of a well-known Oriental
trading family, has his fling at the
way Australian produce is marketed
overseas. “Grading and packing methods
adopted by manufacturers dealing in
dried and tinned fruits are a positive
disgrace” ; therefore the U.S.A. is get-
ting a lot of business which Australia
should have enjoyed. “Your quality, in
dried fruits particularly,” he added, “is
sound. It is your methods and grading
that are faulty. It is not uncommon to
find several grades in a single case.”
* * *
It is the same old weary tale that Aus-
tralians overseas have been hearing for
years in every continent.
A Fair Question
“Malleeite”: The champion Clydes-
dales and Shorthorns at the Melbourne
Agricultural Show this year will have
cause to be very proud animals, as they
will be adorned with pure wool neckties
in lieu of silk. I was fortunate enough
to be presented with a tie of this
material, which cost 17s. Being a wool-
grower—l get Is. per pound when lucky
—I could not afford to buy it. The
weight is Hoz. This works out at £9 Is.
4d. per pound. Can any mathematician
tell me who makes the profit of £9 Os. 4d.
per pound out of my wool, and what the
percentage rate is?
Our Own Export Butter
“Aub”: Australian butter producers
have made a move to get unblended
butter into the hands of the English con-
sumer. George Stening, of Producers’
Co-operative Distributing Society, will
leave for London in a week or two to
inaugurate a scheme for patting Aus-
tralian butter on its arrival in London,
and having it wrapped in paper bearing
the “Sunny South” trademark. The
London factory used by Maoriland has
been placed at Australia’s disposal as a
preliminary to the opening of an Aus-
tralian factory in London.
Australian butter has no identity in
London—it is blended with everything
that comes along. So when a shopper
asks for Australian butter the shopkeeper
says, “I have none.” Despite this, Aus-
tralian butter is advertised on London
’buses and in other places. The Australia
House organisation to sell Australian
trade-marked butter is, therefore, futile.
* * * *
Our sultanas are as good as any in
the world, but they get the same rough
treatment. Australian butter, apart from
maintaining choicest quality, which has
not been done in recent years, must be
placed on ■ the dining-tables of British
consumers in the same condition as it
leaves Australia.
* * * *
Spreadability must be considered seri-
ously in the patting proposition—it is a
quality of which most dairymen have
never heard. Danish butter is preferred
to Australian because 21b. of it will go
as far as 31b. of ours. Therefore, Eng-
lish consumers find it is cheaper in the
long run to pay more for Danish butter.
Citrus Fruit Prices
“Specker”: Tasmanian fruit consumers
are interested to note the net returns
per case to the orange-growers for the
last seven years (B. 16/8/’33). In my
seaboard township—l 2 miles by direct
steamer service to Melbourne —there
seems a fixed minimum price for
medium-sized navel oranges— each,
or five a Is. Small lemons are in the
glut season Id. each—otherwise or
2d. I think these prices rule in all the
country districts of Tasmania. They
make oranges a luxury to the average
householder. Sales are accordingly
checked. Can any light be thrown on
the curious fact that fruit should approxi-
mately treble in value during its short
passage across the strait?
Apple Prices and Export
“Tassie”: “Five Crown” (B. 28/8/’33)
is very moderate when he says that costs
eat up the whole of the price received for
Australian export apples sent to Eng-
land. The position is worse than that.
Many growers receive debit notes. Pro-
fessor Wadham has estimated that Eng-
lish charges per case amount to Is. B|d.
Australian currency. Australian charges
after leaving the orchard are 6s. 7d., and
before reaching the grower’s railway
station a further Is. 9d. —total Bs. 4d.
Australian, or 6s. Bd. sterling. The Pro-
fessor, writing in a Victorian paper,
quotes one instance in which 3191 cases
realised an average of 7s. 4.8 d. per case.
He adds:
This shows clearly that the whole of the
export season is likely to result in a charge on
the growers concerned —a net loss rather than
a profit.


SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Revealing a wonderful burst of speed
when he got balanced, Chatham (7 to 4
on) won the weight-for-age Canterbury
Stakes in course-record time for the six
furlongs, 1.12, He was followed home
by Tom Pinch and by little Carefree,
who did well in the last two furlongs.
She carried Bst. 91b., but drops to 7st.
51b. in the Epsom, and her performance
was good. Of course Chatham’s run en-
hanced his prospects for the big mile.
If the weather conditions are favorable
to the son of Windbag on September 30
he will have an army of backers despite
his 9st. 101 b.
Bought for 80 guineas at a mixed sale
by the Randwick trainer Dan Lewis,
Outback’s win (at 5 to 1) in the Three-
year-old made her third in succession.
She led throughout to win easily from
Gothlin and Thaddeus. The popular
fancies, Journal and Measure, were never
dangerous. There were excuses for
both: Journal was always wide out and
had iio luck in running, while Measure
ran greenly—he appeared to be scared
of the big field. Outback is bred the
right way, being by Backwood from a
Sylvanite mare, Miss Sylvanite. The
dam came into the sale ring with Out-
back, and was sold for five guineas.
Her owner allowed Lewis to keep the
old mare until Outback was broken in.
Good offers for Outback have been re-
fused.

Peter Riddle has always held the

Hall Mark gave Caulfield punters a
great shock by his Memsie Stakes failure.
In a field of seven 10 to 9 was laid on
the Heroic colt. His only rival
with high credentials was Waltzing Lily ;
and Hall Mark had beaten the Beau
Fils mare brilliantly in the Underwood
Stakes at Williamstown: on that form
the extra furlong at Caulfield ought to
have enhanced his prospects. Tables
were turned with a vengeance. Waltzing
Liliy was ridden a waiting race on this
occasion ; she finished wonderfully well
to score by 31 lengths from Break Up,
who was a head in advance of Hall
Mark.
Possibly Hall Mark was a trifle off
color. He seemed nervy on arrival
at the course and would not submit to
being dried off after emerging from the
hosing stall. Following the pace set by
L’Elite he was ideally situated at the
straight entrance; yet when Dempsey
asked Hall Mark to draw away from
Break Up and the tiring L’Elite he re-
sponded poorly. Slipping through on
the rails, Waltzing Lily smothered the
leaders for speed and swept past the
judge amidst a salvo of cheering.
Wheriko, who captured the Warriston
Handicap, is in the A.J.C. Derby, but
Eric Connolly, owner-trainer of the
Night Raid colt, doubts whether he is
forward enough in condition to be taken
to Sydney. That Wheriko is a thorough-
bred of high calibre cannot be ques-
tioned. On Saturday he was cantering
alongside Folk Lore at the head of affairs.
The filly pinned him on the rails just
as Rapsonia threw out a challenge. Tak-
ing full advantage of this occurrence, the
rider of Rapsonia assumed command and
appeared to have the race well won.
However, Ashley Reed gave Wheriko a
few cracks with the whip and Connolly’s
candidate bounded along with giant
strides to score by three-quarters of a
length.
Wheriko disputed favoritism with
Brutus, the colt that defeated Hall Mark
at the V.R.C. August meeting. Brutus
is not nippy in a field. He had few
horses behind him at the three-furlongs
post, but came home well to run fifth.
Rapsonia (by Curialis from a sister to
Biplane) will be taken to Sydney by
Percy Foster. He won the Maribyrnong
Plate.
Danilo, who won the first division of
the Doona Trial at Caulfield, must be
reckoned with in the minor handicaps
at the spring meetings, and may have a
an outside chance in the Melbourne Cup
with 7st. Danilo belongs to F. E. Cob-
bold, a Queensland pastoralist; he is by
Chivalrous from Operetta. Sheer bad
luck prevented Chief Mate from taking
the second division of the Doona Trial,
for which he started favorite. Pratted
out at the start, Chief Mate did well to
run second to Orford, a Pantheon geld-
ing.
Dick Devon finished with lion-like
courage in the Heatherlie Handicap to
beat Jimmie Boy by half a head, with
Metallurgy a similar distance further off.
The six-furlongs Whittier Handicap was
captured from start to finish by the favor-
ite, Palphar, a colt by Fernkloof, in the
Flemington stable of E. Fisher.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
“Bad Bill” Beth, said to weigh 2091 b.,
looked big enough to overwhelm King
Elliott at Leichhardt on Saturday night,
and seemed certain to win when his
standing overarm headlock and body-
press pinned his man in the fourth. But
Beth began fighting like a Fuzzy Wuzzy
from then on. A series of rabbit-killers
had Elliott so sick in the sixth that the
referee intervened with a reprimand.
Beth argued the point with the official,
and was still arguing when Elliott’s flying
tackle and body-press scored a fall.
Elliott on points.

The Nineteenth Hole
The inter-Dominion match between
Maoriland and Australian women golfers
in Melbourne had an unsatisfactory end-
ing, illness compelling Susie Tolhurst and
Mona Macleod to forfeit in their four-
somes. M.L. won by 3 matches 13 holes
to 3 matches 8 holes.

The Australian mixed foursomes
championship was won by Jim Ferrier,
of N. S. Wales, and Olive Kay, of Maori-
land, with scores of 74 in the first round
and 83 in the second. The course record
was 79.

“Bertha Biffem”: N.S.W. associate
golfers are hoping to see the M.L. golfer-
ettes in action in Sydney after the Aus-
tralian championships if the visitors can
find the time. An interesting personality
is their player-captain, Mrs. Guy Wil-
liams, winner of the Australian cham-
pionship in Adelaide in 1920. The lady
has won the All Black title four times,
the first victory in 1907, and is still a
fine player. Another outstanding player
is Mrs. Templer, the present M.L. cham-
pion. As Miss Wright, she won the title
in 1919-20-21.

“FJ.H.&B.”: The quarrel between the
Riverina Golf Association and the
N.S.W. Golf Council is blazing up again,
Some time ago the State body ordered
its subordinate shows to adopt a system
of par handicapping based on yardage,
Riverina declined to agree, and recently
the State Suburban and Country Golf
Association hopped in behind the Coun-
cil and threatened to discipline the rebs.
At the annual meeting Riverina decided
to tell the opposition to dig a divot and
bury itself, with a hint that it might
raise the flag of Secesh and join up with
the outlanders on the other side o.f the
Murray.

Footbrawl
Vic. League finished its first round last
Saturday. Richmond, certain of first place,
quickly showed superiority over Fitzroy.
The Tigers were faster and cleverer,
and ran away from the Maroons with
109 points to 61. South Melbourne, hav-
ing gained a fair lead on Geelong, set
about piling up a mighty score, so as to
oust Carlton from second place. Mark-
ing excellently, passing accurately and
kicking straight, it got the Hubbites
rattled. At the end South had 155 points
to Geelong’s 46, Pratt booting seven
goals. Collingwood won its last game
and achieved its 21st consecutive defeat
of Melbourne by 127 to 104 ; and Carl-
ton’s Blues bested St. Kilda by 145 to
93. Footscray got home from North Mel-
bourne with 58 to 53, and Hawthorn
wished the wooden spoon on to Essen-
don by collecting 68 points to 63. Next
Saturday Carlton meets Geelong on the
M.C. ground in the first semi-final.
* H= * *
“Scout”: A feature of the recent Aus-
tralian football gathering in Sydney, a
gathering supposed to promote inter-State
amity, has been the usual attempts of
Victorian clubs to poach players. J. Stiff,
the Sydney “pony” rover, who was
awarded the Conder Cup for the best
and fairest player at the Sydney meeting,
has been approached by Hawthorn. St.
Kilda has made offers to the McCallum
brothers, of South Australia. Buying up
the best men from other States is a poor
method of encouraging the game, and
it is time the Australian Council took
drastic action to prevent it.
Able to play their Number One team
in its proper positions for the first time,
the Wallabies won the fiith and final
Test at Bloemfontein, on a “dirt” ground.
by 15-4, scoring a dropped goal and
three tries, one converted, to a dropped
gotd. The Australians ran up 12 points
to 4 in the first half, and, though only one
try was added in the second, the side
missed many scoring openings. In this
half South Africa lost Fanie Louw, and
another crack forward in Nel was off for
some minutes. Ross, playing his first
Test, was a great asset at full-back, his
defence being impenetrable. Malcolm
was at his best behind the pack and the
placing of Sturtridge at five-eighth, and
Steggall at outside-threequarter gingered
up the back division tremendously. A
feature of the game was the effective
bottling of goal-dropping Benny Osier by
breakaway Louden. In the five Tests,
Australia scored 42 points to South
Africa’s 50, and the record of two wins
out of five games compares with the 1928
All Blacks’ two out of four, though the
M.L. side scored only 26 against 39.
* * * *
The Rugby Union semi-finals in Syd-
ney provided one of the best club games
the code has staged for years when
Randwick met Manly. Randwick
won by 10-9, thanks to a fine dropped
goal by McCauley, the balance of the
score coming from a try and a penalty
goal. Manly scored three tries, two of
them by Wauchope, after splendid pass-
ing rushes. All through both sides
tackled with fiery determination, but
there was no sign of frayed tempers.
At University Oval, North Sydney won
a slow game from Western Suburbs by
9-3, the big Red-and-Black forwards
proving too solid for the Westerners.
Northern now meets Randwick in the
final, but the winner must face a chal-
lenge by Manly.
* * * *
Sydney Rugby League staged only one
semi-final on Saturday, between St.
George and Eastern Suburbs. Each had
scored 10 points when time was up, and
the referee was waiting, whistle at lips,
for the ball to go dead. Tipping, of St.
George, dropped for goal. Forward Ruth-
erford, chasing it, fell on the ball and
was awarded a try amid a hullabaloo
of congratulation and protest, St. George
thus winning 13-10. There is no doubt
that Rutherford was standing in front
of Tipping when he kicked for goal and
was thus yards offside in touching down.
The referee made his decision, however,
and that has to stand.
* * * *
The Kangaroos had a good win against
Hull Kingston Rovers, a Yorkshire
Northern Union club, by 20 points to
nil, after leading in the first half by
three points.
* * * *
“Gate”: The N.S.W. Rugby League
authorities, who are said to be consider-
ing the idea of playing football by arti-
ficial light during the coming summer
nights, would do well to think over the
matter. Lighting the ground would be
an expensive job, and players would have
to be paid as usual. Further, the exten-
sion of the football season into the
cricket year would hardly draw the
necessary crowds. Even the regular day
games during the past season have shown
marked falling off in attendances, especi-
ally at the inter-State matches with
Queensland, and it would be unwise to
drug the market.
(Continued on page 30.)
Starting favorite at 5 to 3 on, Bobby
Pearce won his first professional scull-
ing race at Toronto, beating champion
Ted Phelps by over 200 yards in 19min.
26sec. for the three miles. The course
was a mile long, necessitating three turns,
conditions under which the Australian
had never rowed before. Phelps drew
the inside position, but never had a look
in. Pearce has never been beaten in a
scratch race and is probably the finest
sculler who ever sat in a shell.

North Adelaide, kicked 16 goals against
South Adelaide, the greatest number

“Fitzcray”: Small wonder Australian
football is so popular with Melbourne
citizens. Footscray Council has been
counting up the profits derived from the
use of its ground by the Footscray and
other clubs in its bailiwick. Not count-
ing the present season, the total bag
since 1925 has been £8570 as far as the
council was concerned, the lowest cut
being £622 in 1925 and the highest £1311
in 1928. This season the council’s
squeeze is over £900 to date and more
to come. Ratepayers must sleep sound
in Footscray.

“Kogarah”: The St. George (N.S.W.)
Rugby Union club is feeling what Uncle
Remus would call “mighty biggity” these
days. For years it has won the wooden
spoon for adorning bottom place in the
Sydney R.U. grade competition. This
year it has been deprived of the honor
by Eastern Suburbs and to mark the
occasion has purchased a spoon of the
largest size and as wooden as an M.L.A.’s
head to be presented to Eastern. 1 live
in Eastern Suburbs and have been wait-
ing for indications of sturm und drang
thereabout. Nothing has happened so
far, so I conclude the presentation has
not yet been made.
* * * *
“Rand” writes from Pretoria: —
Dr. Ross and liis men may not be the great-
est Rugby players to tour South Africa, but
they are without doubt the best-liked. The
secret is that they play the type of Rugby the
public wants to see and play it in such a
clean and sporting spirit. Apart from the game
they are very popular off the field and have
done more to rehabilitate Australia’s reputation
as sportsmen than anything that could have
been thought of. In consequence of their visit
the Larwood-Jardine tirades against Australians
are falling flat. The Wallabies have proved them-
selves a band of high-spirited schoolboys. Before
they had been in the country a week they were
singing Dutch songs with evident delight.
Whenever they arrive anywhere it’s always to
the strains of the now-famous South African
song “Sarie Marais.”
* * :|= *
“Senex”: Referring to that Rugby
Union match between N.S.W. and
Queensland, played in 1883 (B. 30/8/’33),
I would like to point out that it was
staged as a co-attraction with an Aus-
tralian Rules match between Ipswich and
Brisbane. The national code was then
the ruling one in Queensland, the Union
having been only just founded. The
Aussies not only helped their rivals to
draw the crowd but whacked the gate
with them. That sort of brotherly love
has gone to the pack these many years.
* * * *
“Yarker”Though the Kangaroos
opened their season in the North of Eng-
land with two wins over St. Helens and
Leigh clubs in Lancashire, the cabled
criticisms of their play have not been
flattering, most surprising of them being
that they lacked speed. All the same this
was noticeable in the inter-State matches
in Sydney between Queensland and
N.S.W. In the League game, with only
13 men on each side, speed counts for
much. The tourists are suffering also
from sickness and injuries, while the rul-
ings of the local umpires, always a source
of trouble with Australian League sides
,in England, are again hampering their
stylf- of play.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Divot Digger”: When a N.S.W. coun-
try player, George Quinlan, holed out in
one with a drive of 286 yards at Moore
Park the other day, it was claimed as a
State record. This is incorrect, for in 1929
one J. L. Garvey holed out a 311-yard
shot on the Braidwood course in one.
The best British figures for the feat are
340 yards at Southampton, but, of
course, America has gone one better. At
Los Angeles last year a player named
Melius did the trick for a 374-yard hole.
* * * *
"Huon”: The Tasmanian professional
golf championship final again resolved
itself into a family affair at Kingston
Beach links. At the first essay, “Jock”
Robertson, winner of the Australian pro-
fessional title in 1930, tied with his son,
W. 8.. who is the titleholder, at the end
of 72 holes, each card recording 291.
Youth was served in the play-off over
36 holes, W.B. downing his parent with
149 to the old man’s 152. “Jock” won
the title in 1931, so the tribe has scored
three years running.
!JC * * *
“Sandringha m”: The inler-State
matches for the Gladys Hay Cup formed
the curtain-raiser for the Australian
women’s golf championship in Mel-
bourne last week, Victoria taking the
pot by beating N.S.W. and Tasmania,
while the latter unexpectedly eliminated
South Australia. The Victorians outed
Ma by 3 to 2, the Tolhurst sisters and
Mona McLeod accounting for Odette
Lefebvre, Joan Hammond and Miss
Wray respectively. Miss Jones and Miss
Slack won for N.S.W. The Tasmanians
routed South Australia 5-0, the State
champion, Miss Seeck, and last year's
holder of the title, Kate Rymill, being
PUG: “I won't be game to go home to the missus with a face like this.”
SECOND: "After a couple more rounds you won't have to."
among the defeated. The Tassie-Vic-
toria match went to the Cabbage
Garden by 4 to 1, the only Victorian to
go down being Shirley Tolhurst, beaten
by Miss E. Reid 2 up.
* * * *
“Hotham”: Having decided to offer
£5OOO for prizes to professional golfers
attending the centenary golf tournament,
Victorians are busy drawing up lists of
celebrities to invite so as to have a chance
of getting the money back on big gates.
In addition to Hagen, Sarazen and Kirk-
wood, invitations are to be sent to Brit-
ish players, including Abe Mitchell and
Henry Cotton. It is doubtful whether
these or other topnotchers from both
countries who have been mentioned
could afford to come on the chance of
getting a whack of £5OOO.
Car and Cycle
“Buzz-off”: No true motorist likes a
traffic cop, whether of the stationary-
dome variety or the conversational-cum-
notebook kind, but it is felt that one
English driver is carrying his feelings too
far. Driving a fast car, he is in the habit
of hurling eggs at the John Hop as he
passes, and with astonishing accuracy of
aim. Owing to the eggs and other handi-
caps, no one, at last advices, had yet
managed to get his number, and the vil-
lain was still being pursued. If the trick
catches on in this country, Australia with
its emu eggs will be an unchancy place
for the man in blue.
* * * *
“Exhaust”: It appears that Australia
still holds one motor-cycle speed record,
the flying mile with sidecar, at the rate
of 124.41 m.p.h., done by Allan Bruce,
being undefeated. Some time ago the
German rider Henne, who holds the
world’s solo record, was reputed to have
broken this with a rate of 124.50 m.p.h.
His figures have been checked and
proved to be only 123.73 m.p.h., so we
can all breathe again.
* * >K *
“Kick Starter”: The motor-cycling
world got a shock the other day when
it was announced that the Isle of Man
T.T. race, the Derby and Melbourne
Cup of motor-cycling rolled into one,
may be abandoned. The twisty, hilly
route is becoming dangerous for modern
high speeds, and the Government of
Man, which pays £5OOO annually for the
privilege of staging the race, has to
spend much more in keeping the road
route in repair. Further, the quieter
section of the Manxmen is cursing the
crowding and the noise.
* * * *
“Sprocket”: George Dempsey, the
Sydney professional cyclist, who is one
of the many riders from this side to gain
fame on American tracks, has won the
U.S.A. sprint championship. He com-
pleted the job by capturing the five-mile
in lOmin. 34 4-ssec. He came with a
great run in the last lap, and, catching
his Australian cobber, Cecil Walker, who
had held the title for three years, won
by inches;
Racquet and Bawl
“Top Spin”: The Australian tennis
authorities have wisely decided not to
challenge for the Davis Cup in the new
Pacific zone, though Norman Brookes,
who fathered the idea, was strongly in
favor of doing so. If a challenge is
made, it should be in the European zone,
as was the case this year; and there
should be no “if” about it in view of
recent performances.
❖ * * *
“T. Edax”: It looks as if Helen Wills-
Moody, like all conquerors, has come to
her Waterloo. Playing countrywoman
Helen Jacobs in the final of the Ameri-
can tennis singles, she retired after each
had won a set, pleading muscular trouble.
It is interesting to recall that Suzanne
Lenglen, her great forerunner, did the
same thing when up against Helen her-
self in New York. On that occasion the
Lenglen sought solace in tears ; but Helen
lived up to her nickname, “Pokerface.”
The fallen champion can boast a great
record. Since Suzanne retired there has
been no woman player able to live with
her, and her successes in America and at
Wimbledon have been ensured by the
mere fact of her appearance on the
courts.
* * * *
“T. Model”: In America they have
extended mass-production methods to
tennis matches. Recently a match was
played between the Universities of North
and South Carolina, 200 players taking
part on each side. Twenty matches were
played on each ground on each day, and
the show took five days to put through.
All the rubbers were singles, and North
Carolina won by 129 to 71. After all
that it is easy to imagine that the Gov-
ernors of the opposing States delivered
themselves of the famous aphorism in
chorus.
Miscellaneous
In Sydney on September 21 the man-
agers for the next Eleven to tour Eng-
land will be chosen and selectors
appointed. The favorite in the betting
for first manager is the Victorian W. L.
Kelly, who ran the 1930 side with con-
spicuous success and showed himself a
sound disciplinarian. H. W. Hodgetts, a
South Australian, will probably catch the
second job if Kelly wins through. Both
are members of the Board of Control.
The selectors will probably be the same
lot as last season, C. E. Dolling (S.A.),
W. H. Johnson (Vic.) and E. A. Dwyer
(N.S.W.).
* * * *
“Aigburth”: Echoes of the bodyline
controversy are faintly dying, though the
South African cricket authorities have
momentarily revived them with a con-
demnation of the practice, following in
Australia’s footsteps. Opinion in Eng-
land has swung completely round. It is
evident that Jardine will not captain Eng-
land in the coming series, though much
face-saving propaganda is going on.
* * * *
“Shinty”: The inter-State hockey
tournament in Brisbane ended in a win
for Queensland, which becomes cham-
pion State for the year. The final game
between N.S.W. and the home side,
neither of whom had been defeated in the
series, fittingly ended in a draw. Queens-
land had the better goal average for the
tournament, and so took the title. The
fight for third place between Victoria and
Westralia went to the Gropers, who won
4-0.
* * * *
“Lignum” : There is a growing stand in
N.S.W. bowls against the refusal of the
heads to permit payment of travelling
and housing expenses for touring teams
on the ground that this amounts to pro-
fessionalism, though the Olympic Federa-
tion permits it. As it is, only those who
can afford to spend the money can go
away on inter-State sides, and this limits
the choice of first-class players. Not
one of the N.S.W. team which recently
went to Brisbane to meet Queensland was
selected for the Ma State match in Syd-
ney against Victoria.


A GALLERY OF GOLFERS.
No. 6.
The Merry Men of Manly.
Manly Golf Club began in 1903 with 12
members, soon to be known as “The
Twelve Apostles.”
These early enthusiasts included H.
D. L. Woods, Geo. Walker, A. V. Hil-
liard and C. A. Wood, the coterie con-
sorting at Fairlight on the harbor side,
moving later to a six-hole course at
Farrell’s Paddock. Hunter Smith and
H. D. L. Woods were the first captain
and hon. sec. respectively, and all the
members were on the committee. Then
the brothers Norman and Roland Pope
were instrumental in reserving a large
area near the Paddock course. Two
years later, after expenditure of much
work and money, the club had a well-
laid-out links. In honor of the aid given
by the Popes, Thomas Hughes donated
the Founders’ Cup, which is played for
annually.
Increasing membership led to the
formal founding of the club in 1906, and
in 1908 an 18-hole course was opened
amid great rejoicings. The ground was
sour and soggy, but here again the Popes
worked wonders. In 1909, E. Duret
was appointed secretary, and his great
work until his retirement in 1926 pushed
the club on to success. In 1917 it was
formed into a company and the links
purchased from the Popes. Great im-
provements have been effected, including
the erection of the splendid clubhouse
in 1924. There are now over 600 mem-
bers of all ratings.
In addition to the Founders’ Cup,
trophies include the Summer and Autumn
cups, scratch-handicaps now over 20
years old. A foursomes championship
is another notable event.
The first player to catch Frith’s eye is
the young giant Jim Ferrier, still in his
teens. Among many fine performances
may be included his winning of the
N.S.W. amateur championship in 1931
and his place in the final of that year’s
Australian championship, won by Harry
Williams, of Victoria. No. 2 is S. A.
Dimant, who is general manager of Jute
Industries off the links. A good player,
continuously in the club 18, he is a
popular member of the house commit-
tee and a mine of information about the
club, of which he is vice-president.
E. I. Proud is a long-marker and a
prominent member of the Saturday “bob-
in” school. One of the firm of Prouds,
Ltd., he is a regular player in club com-
petitions, with a left-hand stance. Fourth
to heave in sight is Fred Marks, head
of the Meat Board. He is hon. treasurer,
and for seven years has controlled the
finances with watchful care. He, too,
is a left-hander, but there are indica-
tions that club bridge is luring him from
the straight and narrow fairway.
No. 5 is T. M. Fitzsimons, general
manager of Maize Products. A very
popular captain for the last two years
and, as head of the green committee, re-
sponsible for many improvements to the
course. No. 6 is W. (“Bill”) Smith, who is
a schoolmaster at North Shore High. Fie
is an ardent follower of Proud’s school,
and as a long-marker is dangerous in his
class. S. T. Jones has drawn the little
7. He is, a solicitor and a member of a
notable quartette —Unsworth, Freeman
Jones and Hicks. Each wins so many
balls off the other that balancing the
ledger has been given up in despair.
Next comes the amiable G. J. Wilkin-
son, patron of the club and one of the
oldest members. The club has much to
thank him for, its present standing and
fine clubhouse included. He is a retired
banker and an indefatigable Saturday
attendant. S. R. Maisey is another mem :
ber of long standing and Saturday-after-
noon proclivities. He tries without much
success to reduce his handicap to A grade
standard. An architect and a Digger, he
is responsible for the new Manly dress-
ing-sheds.
No. 10 is Eric Apperly, one of the best
golfers Australia has produced—winner of
one Australian and five N.S.W. amateur
championships. He is an architect and
has designed many clubhouses and golf
courses. Rowley Harris is one of the
vice-presidents and was head of the house
committee for some years, while he is
also on the finance committee. He is a
keen long-mark golfer.
No. 12 is W. E. Field, head of Texas
Oil in N.S.W. Probably takes more balls
from his pal, Polkinghorne, of Meggitt’s,
than any other member. Both can be
seen on the links at five any summer
morning and do great work with the ham
and eggs at breakfast. He also is a
Digger. C. H. W. Lloyd (“Old Charley”)
has drawn the Devil’s number. He is
official assignee.- He plays regularly in
spite of his 77 years and is always on
view on Saturdays.
No. 14 is J. A. (“Woodrow”) Wilson.
An old member and an ex-committee-
man, he is addicted to shoYts and a ten-
nis-shade while playing. A keen long-
marker, his specialty off the course is
brown bread and jam. The affable-look-
ing chap at No. 15 is H. J. Unsworth,
a fire-insurance expert. On the 21 mark,
he has a habit of winning competitions.
He is a great barracker for the club and
strong on functions. Next is Harold
Barker, a vice-president and member of
the club and green committees. Harold
is a solicitor with leanings to golf archi-
tecture, and has captained the B team for
the last few years.
No. 17 presents T. E. Hall, of the fur-
nishing firm of A. Hall and Co.,
member of the club and house’ com-
mittees. His success in increasing the
size of the club meat-pies has won him
the eternal gratitude of his fellow-mem-
bers. A. H. Wright, who follows, is an
architect and a partner of Apperly. He
is an ex-committeeman, and was a mem-
ber of the club 18, though he has lately
fallen a victim to bridge. Alf Chitty is
the professional, and carries much weight
in his office, as the drawing suggests. He
was once assistant to J. H. Taylor, and he
would be one of the best players in the
country if his putting could be made
over. Alf Chitty has been eight years
with the club and is a general favorite
with the members he coaches so success-
fully.
No. 20 is X. A. Seppelt, one of the
famous wine-making family. He is
the biggest man in the club and the
longest driver —when he happens to
connect with the ball. Very popular,
he is another of the regular Saturday
brigade and tries hard but in vain to
reduce his handicap as the years roll on.
Last comes J. B. Ferrier, now secretary
of the club, which he joined in 1912.
He was Manly champion for two years
and captain for a year. He is the father
of Jim Ferrier, who has benefited greatly
since he was broken to the game by dad’s
experience and enthusiasm.
“Hoylake”: Referring back to veteran
Michael Scott’s recent win in the Bris-
bane amateur golf championship, it is
noteworthy that five of the seven brothers
and sisters making up the family have
among them captured 15 national cham-
pionships. Michael himself bagged six
Australian and two French titles. A
sister, Lady Margaret, had three shies
at the British women’s championship
and won each time —in 1893-4-5.
Osmond Scott won the Italian cham-
pionship, besides being runner-up in the
British amateur, and Denys Scott twice
collected the Italian title.

PARENTS SHOULD KNOW THIS
HOW TO SAVE MONEY BY MAKING
FAMILY COUGH REMEDY.
It is essential that all parents should
know how to save money by making their
I own family cough remedy that will prove
safe and effective for every member of the
family from the youngest baby up to the
oldest adult. Here is the recipe, given
by a leading chemist: Into a jug put
four tablespoonfuls of sugar, three of either
treacle or honey, two of vinegar, and a
large breakfastcupful of warm water; stir
until dissolved, and when cold, pour into
a large bottle. Then add a bottle of
concentrated HEENZO (it costs 2/- at all
leading chemists and stores), and you will
have a family supply equal in quantity and
superior in quality to eight ordinary
sized bottles of the usual remedies for
chest and throat ailments, which, if
purchased in single bottles, would cost up to
£l. You will be astounded at the speedy
way HEENZO soothes sore throats, eases
the chest, and banishes coughs, colds, croup,
bronchitis, influenza and whooping cough.
Make it a practice to always have HEENZO
in your home. — Advt.
If any illustration in “The Bulle-
tin” takes your fancy, write to the
Manager, who will quote you price
for the original.

“P.M.”: A friend paid 4s. 6d. to the
Sydney Harbor Trust for having his car
loaded on the deck of an inter-State
steamer. The charge for unloading it at
Fremantle was £2 Bs. The Fremantle
concern, perhaps in preparation for a
vigorous move towards secession, entered
up one item: “War Surtax, 20 per cent. —
7s. 4d.”
* * * *
“L.A.S.”: An unemployed carpenter
and his capable wife landed in a C.Q.
town with the little that they had left.
They rented an empty house, bought fur-
niture for one room, made furniture for
another and let it. Going on with the
stunt, they soon had enough rent com-
ing in to keep them. When the house
was full and nicely furnished they sold
out, went further north and worked it
again. They returned to the C.Q. place
and, finding the old home empty, actu-
ally moved in again. Now he gets jobs
from a furniture firm which keep him
busy.

“Hunter Grub”: “Bim” has something
to say about the married woman in com-
fortable circumstances who beats the
single girl for a job (B. 30/8/’33). What
about daughters of Judges who become
their fathers’ associates? Surely in these
days of misery and distress some battling
Digger could be sought out for this
“work.” In such cases preference is
never given to returned men, although
preference laws are on our statute books,
nor are vacancies advertised in the news-
papers, though—in one State, at least —
regulations clearly state that they should
be.

“El V.”: Forty hands were put off last
week in a Vic. jewellery factory employ-
ing 102 ; the rest are on three-quarter
time. Another result of Japanese com-
petition, which even 100 per cent, inter-
mediate charges between factory and
landed cost cannot beat down. Studs
which cost 9s. 6d. per gross to produce
in an Australian factory are landed from
Japan, duty included, at 6s. lid., and,
what is worse, they bear no mark of
origin. Spring wrist-bands, which cost
Is. 6d. to manufacture here, are, in the
case of the Japanese article, sold retail
in the Commonwealth at 3d.

“Country Ped”: I agree with “Busi-
ness Woman” (B. 23 /8 / ’33); there should
be equal pay for the sexes. Then more
men, now unemployed because women
at lower wages have taken their places,
would get work. For months I have
been trying to find a job for my son,
aged 16, after his four years of second-
ary education. As once more we drew
blank and came out of an office, the
liftman greeted us: “No luck, sir?....
It’s hard on boys these times. But do
you know what makes it harder? Girls.
How many men did you see in that
office? One —the manager. Why a girl
would beat me for my job only for
these.” And he tapped his badge and
empty sleeve significantly.

“T.P.W.”: Australians renewing
acquaintance with the Dudley de Chairs
in their English home get an agreeable
surprise. The former denizens of Syd-
ney Government House live in a pic-
turesque fourteenth-century mansion at
Virginia Water, a delightful spot on the
Thames ; but the really beautiful wood-
work is twentieth-century. Doors, wains-
coting and parquetry flooring are, in
fact, of timbers selected by Lady de
Chair in N. S. Wales, Queensland and
Tasmania. Much of the fashioning and
polishing was done by the old Sydney
firm of Beale; and Lady de Chair
proudly tells the visitor that no better
job of the kind has ever been turned out
for her. From Sydney also came Chinese
lamps and Chinese-carved chairs.

“General Prac.” has the last word:
According to J. W. Fletcher (B. 23/8/’33), 1
decry the cult of chiropractic. I do—and l
speak by the card. Dissections and X-rays
proved, long since, that these “pressures” on
spinal nerves by vertebrae do not exist. Even
if the vertebrae were displaced, no chiropractor’s
thumb could move them, so firmly are the
bones anchored by ligaments and cartilage. It
may be that the chiropractic course lasts four
years; but students might equally well devote
their attention to palmistry or astrology. The
healer fined in Sydney for assault was a mere
naturopath, says Mr. Fletcher. Naturopathy’s
high-priest (he belongs to Connecticut) includes
the study of chiropractic in his curriculum. And
what if 41 out of 48 States in the U.S.A. have
given the chiropractors a legal status? The
country which approves a Volstead amendment
and prosecutes a schoolmaster for preaching
Evolution is bound to cause a laugh sooner
or later.

The price of wool is up again; our people shout

SPARE


NORTH OF
TWENTY-EIGHT
Northern Faces (No. 1)
The faces on this page are well known
North of Twenty-eight. Every one is
that of an identity. (1) F. E. loxton is
B.P.’s manager—known in every port on
the coast and in the Islands. He lends
dignity to every gathering and looks like
one of the nobler characters in Conrad.
His chief pride in these days resides in
two successful sons, who are doing
things at Cambridge. (2) P. J. Symes
is a bit of Brisbane. He was the part-
ner who carried the baby in Denham
Brothers while the head of the firm was
Premier. He is a prominent golfer, a
leading light in the Royal National Agri-
cultural Society—he has done a lot of
hard work building up the Brisbane Show
—an active clubman, and is busy in half
a dozen other fields. “Age does not
wither him nor the years condemn.”
(3) Next we come to Alderman
W. R. Warmington, a civic dignitary of
the old school, a good tradesman who
looks like an echo of the days when Labor
was Labor and didn’t dabble in tin hares.
It is hard to believe that once upon a time
Conservative brother-aldermen looked
on him as the Red Menace incarnate and
nervous town clerks ran their eye over
NORTHERN FACES, No. 1.
F. E. Loxton.
P. J. Sytnes.
Alderman W. R. Warmington.
Godfrey Morgan, M.L.A.
Brisbane’s Lord Mayor.
his budding portliness in an involuntary
search for the bulge of a bomb. He is
probably the only man in Brisbane who
does not play golf. An inch of well-laid
guttering means more to Warmington
than the best brassey lie ever sent by for-
tune, and the only bunker which troubles
him is the shifting bank of blue clay on
which Brisbane rests and which pulls
sewerage pipes out of shape as it moves.
(4) Godfrey Morgan came from Vic-
toria to help run the North. He lives just
beyond the prickly-pear belt, and though
the spikes have not got into his soul they
sometimes get into his Parliamentary
language, which is free and direct and
painful hearing to the Forgan Smiths.
He is a tall, wiry grazier, like a fallen
mulga limb with a sprinkling of snow
on the top end. He was Moore’s Min-
ister for Transport, and is a hard fighter
for the man on the land. He plays golf
—successfully—as if he were swinging
an axe.
Last in the procession is Brisbane’s
Lord Mayor Greene. He is sad, as befits
one who has been a master builder through
a period of depression and the executive
member for finance in a council which
owes £6O per head of population. He
also is dignified, as befits the chief in-
habitant of a Town Hall about the size
of the Louvre. He served in the war
‘with the Honourable Artillery Company
and the British Tank Corps, and came
home with the M.M. and a serious wound.
He probably is the only Welshman in
Australia who has never sung “Sospan
Bach, but nobody would deny that he
is the right type of immigrant.
Kokopo : The N.D.L. ship Seydlitz,
which was with Von Spee’s outfit early
in the war to help cause us Northerners
a few qualms occasionally, goes to the
shipbreakers at last. She had a varied
career. When Sturdee scuppered the
rest of the fleet, she succeeded in get-
ting into Argentine waters by the skin
of her teeth, was interned, handed over
to the Allies at the close of hostilities,
and eventually bought back by her origi-
nal owners.
* * * *
“Capricornia”: Rockhampton, which
achieved railway connection direct with
Brisbane in 1903, is celebrating 1933 by
establishing a new bi-weekly aerial ser-
vice with the capital which will make it
possible for passengers to travel in four
hours the distance that used to take 18
hours by rail. The fare will be £5 ss.
each way, and, with the Cairns service
supplementing the local one, the central
capital should soon be thoroughly air-
minded.
* * * *
“Mataranka”: Queensland surely holds
the record for railway joyriders Last
year 2877 of them —nearly one to every
two miles of railway—were convicted
and fined the useful total of £2428. Some
of them follow strenuous exercise on
bogeys by rest cures in cells when they
cannot pay their fines; but Mullan,
Queensland’s courteous Attorney-Gen-
eral, told somebody in Parliament the
other day that it would take a clairvoyant
to tell how many.
* * * *
“Frigid”: Two mates were out shoot-
ing recently in a scrub at Glastonbury
(Q.). Missing a half-bred retriever dog
which they had taken with them for find-
ing scrub turkeys, the men retraced their
tracks. Down a side-track came the
dog triumphantly carrying a young wal-
laby, around which was tightly coiled
a very-much-alive six-foot carpet snake.
One fold of the reptile around the dead
marsupial’s body was in the dog’s mouth.
Between his legs swayed the snake’s
head, while round his nose turned the
reptile’s tail. The snake immediately
darted at another dog which had re-
turned with the shooters, but did not
bite the dog which was carrying it. It
was quickly dispatched.
* * * *
“N’lmporte”: Inside an old building
in Lake-street, Cairns, which was demol-
ished last week were found bundles of
papers dating as far back as the ’seven-
ties. The place was the original estab-
lishment of the Cairns “Advocate,” which
started its hectic career as a Labor organ
in 1897. It was hardly on the dead-line
when a libel writ was thrust under its
nose and the whole staff was besieged
for nine or ten days in the office by
bailiffs. The bailiffs won, and old Mick
Boland built them a shack on his own
property. Chief among the directors in
those days were Gilbert Bates and Tom
Givens —later a Senator. Afterwards
Percy Pease came in. They were not
long in the new premises before another
writ lost them their plant. They went
across the road and lost that. Then Ihe
North Queensland Bank built them a place
lower down Lake-street, where a print-
ing office earns a peaceful living nowa-
days. After leaving its first home the
“Advocate” was reconverted and its
name was changed to the “Trinity
Times.” Subsequently the Cairns “Daily
Times” incorporated it, but all the stir-
ring times had faded. These unearthed
files have recalled them to the old hands
still above ground.
* * * *
“L. R. Russ”: Departmental figures
showing the incidence of diphtheria cases
in Queensland are interesting and para-
doxical. In Brisbane the cases increased
from 415 in 1931 to 451 in 1933, but
in the country they dropped from 944 to
661. The reason is that the country has
plumped solidly for immunisation; but
at the end of 1932 only 1 per cent, of
the estimated child population of the city
had been treated. Innovations are usu-
ally made by the city, but the stock-
breeders and dairy-farmers had ex-
perience with the inoculation of cattle
against redwater and other diseases to
guide them. The deaths at Bundaberg
caused a severe check to the activities,
but the Government wisely sent the
Deputy Health Commissioner and the
Education Department’s medical officer
to explain the reasons for that tragedy
and the preventive measures adopted;
then children were brought forward for
treatment in larger numbers. At Nam-
bour, with a population of 15,000 in the
adjacent Lilley district, nearly 1100 chil-
dren have been treated; for the first
eight months of this year there have been
only 24 diphtheria cases, all from unim-
munised families. Less than six years
ago the local isolation building was full
and the school —it has an enrolment of
over 700—was closed and turned into a
temporary hospital to take the overflow.
* * * *
“Elevara”: The curator of the Bris-
bane Botanical Gardens and some pri-
vate experimentalists on Tambourine
Mountain (Q.) are acclimatising the tea
plant with specimens brought from
Assam. Apparently they see a great
Australian industry growing up, but,
though some parts of North Queensland
and, perhaps, a good deal of New Guinea
may be suitable in soil and climate, cheap
labor competition comes into the ques-
tion —and it is cheap labor with a
vengeance, and hard worked at that. All
tea-pickers are women, and they are
driven at such a rate that, merely taking
the tiny tip of the branches—a couple
of tender buds—they put sometimes
301 b. of leaf into the baskets for the
“beauty chorus” to clean up. With a
few Arbitration Court awards operating,
and a few union organisers sitting on the
fence, and the Australian scale of taxation
hitting the grower, who would be com-
peting with countries like Ceylon which
could pay off their national debts with
a couple of years’ revenue, Australian
tea would probably get back to the seven-
teenth-century price if it were grown
here—£s per pound. In New Guinea,
however, it should prove a successful
industry, and it should be possible to
evolve distinctive types.
Gals’ Gossip from Brisbane
En route to Port Moresby, crowded
with tourists, the Strathaird majestically
steamed up the river and deposited hun-
dreds of sightseers in our midst. The
next day the block was congested with
trippers, and tram conductors imparted
as much information in a few hours as
they had done in many weeks. Slacks
still are the fashion in tripper-town,
judging by the loungers bespattering the
decks.
Talking of slacks, our champion tennis
player, Mrs. B. H. Molesworth, is cer-
tain that, no matter how much opposition
there might be, shorts must come into
vogue on the tennis courts. Skirts im-
pede movement too much.
Dot Hood is certainly our best asso-
ciate golfer—she frequently proves it.
Playing in an open-day event out at the
Brisbane club, Dot did a 78.
Mrs. Harry Emmerton, here for a few
days on her way to Port Moresby, found
time to motor to Southport with Cyn-
thia Brookes. They enjoyed themselves.
Cynthia said the road to Southport was
marvellous and the surf beautiful. The
next night Mrs. Emmerton spread a
dinner party at Lennon’s, and invited the
Charles Persses, from Beaudesert, and
the A. E. Moores to share her table. Of
course the Lud Mayor of Melbourne and
Cynthia Brookes were there, too.
Comrade Scullin and Mrs. Scullin
enjoyed themselves so much at Mag-
netic Island that they prolonged their
stay for a week.
There’s a lot of farewelling being done
just now in honor of Frances Jeffrey,
who leaves soon to wed Dr. Charles
Gale, of Sydney. Frances is having two
or three parties every day, and we’re
all sorry she is to live away from Bris-
bane.
“Spare the rod and not spoil the child”
is used with great success at the Wilston
State school. For the last six or eight
years this school of over 600 pupils has
been run entirely without the cane. Some
of the pupils have been right through
every class without having seen it.
Out at the aerodrome at Archerfield,
with a cloudless sky above, club pilots
indulged in flying stunts, while the presi-
dent, Dr. Hope Michod, did the enter-
taining at tea. Mrs. Michod, in brown
with matching hat, brought daughter
Marjorie, looking very attractive in blue
touched up with organdie bows. Yellow
jonquils and wild boronia decorated the
tables. The Arthur Moores and Captain
E. G. Johnstone—he’s Controller of Civil
Aviation—were among the crowd.
Proceeds of a musical matinee went
towards the forthcoming floral festival
for the Creche and Kindergarten. It was
a children’s programme, with a clown
tumbling all over the stage, and a mouth-
organ band. For the grown-ups, Jean
Rigby warbled and Jean Trundle recited.
Audrey, the youngest chick of the E.
E. Forths, .has a brand-new diamond
ring, given her by Thomas Warland, of
Harrow, Middlesex.
Because one of the passengers on the
Strathaird was wicked enough to say he
was going to Papua to learn the native
dances, one of our very worthy temper-
ance citizenesses rose in an injured and
shocked tone to say that modern dances
were loose and unbeautiful. But two of
our dancing experts quickly contradicted
her, and emphatically agreed that a study
of such dancing must be interesting, ori-
ginal and striking—in fact, they wished
they could “go native” themselves.
In the death of Mrs. Percy Blundell,
the Church of England has lost a most
active worker. Wife of P. A. Blundell,
vice-chairman and superintendent of the
Queensland Trustees, the late Mrs. Blun-
dell was a gifted pianist, and for many
years was organist at St. Mary’s Church

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Highlights of Sydney last week were
the tent of sunshot silk the first day
of September spread above the city;
Ella Shields, in a drift of snow-white
tulle with puff shoulder-sleeves of coral
red feathers singing “Good-night, Sweet-
heart,” at the New Tivoli; Wal Taylor’s
Madonna-blue binding of an old-time
French book showing at the Society of
Artists; Mrs. H. Gordon’s afternoon
party at Rose Bay Golf Club
If Beau Brummel had worn a kilt it
would have been with just the air Cap-
tain Patrick wears his. As president of
the Highland Society he attended its
annual ball last week and sat in the high-
backed carved chair that looked first
cousin to that used by Macbeth when
in banqueting mood. On the long table
before him was a ram’s head, which in
reality is the society’s snuffbox, and into
the decoration scheme came sprigs of
heather, tartan ribands, sonsie lassies and
the pipe band with its rousing airs and
swirling plaids. Horderns’ ballroom had
gone all Highland for the occasion ; even
the debutantes strolled up the long room
to make their obeisance squired by kilted
and plaided laddies.
The Commonwealth’s Governor and his
lady blessed the debs., Lady Isaacs wear-
ing white flat crepe sprayed with diamente
for the act. Mrs. Patrick’s frock of white
ring velvet carried epaulettes banded in
black velvet; padre W. J. Baxter and
Mrs. Baxter, from Scotland, were in the
official group, which included the
Mayoral Hagons and the Brigadier-
General Phillips couple, her blue moires
jocundly blazoned in gold roses ; Mrs.
Pope came with her captain, and wore
moss-green chiffons; Police Commis-
sioner Childs brought daughter Muriel;
president of the younger set Mrs. H. C.
Norton fussed up her black laces with
a ruffly pink cape. Nancy Munro, in
poinsettia-red chiffons, and Isobel Sin-
clair, in flame georgettes, were the secre-
taries, and the G. Morices were among
the mighty hosts of the night.
Vinia de Loitte, in a snow-white frock
banded in white fur, a coy little choker of
the same about her slim throat, spread a
Gilbert and Sullivan supper party as her
tribute to Music Week. This filled the
ballroom of the Arts Club with women
and a sprinkling of men, and proved one
of the most entertaining of the harmonic
snacks given to the public since Sydney
went all scales and bars. Vinia, lone-
handed, unfolded “The Mikado” in song
and story, and played her own accom-
paniments. You’d have thought she’d
have been tired by then. But, taking a
breather, the G. and S. enthusiast went
on to reminisce about Gilbertian produc-
tions, and after that, fresh as a daisy,
she started in on a request programme.
Dorothy Brunton made quite a hit in
“Road House” on Saturday night from
the moment of her entrance in a swagger
white cloth motoring coat that fitted the
figure and spread into epaulettes edged
with brown. This was the same hazel
brown of which the flat crepe frock be-
neath was made, and the whole was
topped off with a jaunty white cloth hat.
An evening frock of cream organdie with
epaulettes of black coque, with which
went an evening bag of the cream
trimmed with the same fluffiness, made
one of the striking entrances of the
evening.
This Letter heard the other day of a
bride who was marrying a young surgeon,
and accordingly had the top of her wed-
ding cake iced to represent an operating
theatre. Just as obvious were the deco-
rations at the Music Week Ball. There
was a baby grand piano in lilac, sweet-
pea and pink camellias on the official
table ; clefs and notes (but of course no
bars) were scattered about the horizon,
and a silver treble clef even popped glit-
teringly out of the debs.’ bouquets. There
were seven of these pretty white-clad
girls who curtseyed to Chief Justice
Harvey and his lady after being pre-
sented by Miss Elizabeth Plummer, presi-
dent of the ball, who was impressive in
sky-blue and silver brocades and carried
a floral treble clef triumphantly.
The ball was more than a success ; it
was a great Hosannah to Music Week.
Composer, competitor and eisteddfod
judge were in the whirling throngs that
danced the night away in David Jones’s.
The Lindley Evans couple came, her
coral-red chiffons striking a distinctive
note; Mrs. Orchard’s beige lace frock
spread to epaulettes of amethyst-colored
coque feathers ; secretary Alma Davis’s
dress was like a rosy cloud ; Trix Tange’s
golden head shone above sea-green
taffetas; Norah Cazabon wore spring-
like yellows; silver-grey crepe swathed
Mrs. Edmund Playfair. The Vern Bar-
netts were there, and Constance Burt and
Thelma Houston, and, of course, Roland
Foster.
This is the latest photograph of hand-
some Mrs. Tom Rolin, the subject of
one of Longstaff’s most successful por-
traits. Maid and matron, Mrs. Rolin
has remained one of Sydney’s belles.
She is known in social playgrounds from
Cairns to Adelaide, and she is one of the
watched-for at races and art shows, which
she attends with great enthusiasm and
complete impartiality. Law and medi-
cine are the lady’s background: her
father was eyeman Richard Steer
Bowker, her husband was the late
Judge Rolin, her sister is the wife
of Justice George Rich, and one
of her daughters married law. Her
six brothers, three of them still practis-
ing, all went in for medicine. Dorothy
Welding photograph.
Jean Cheriton, of Doone, gave a party
the other afternoon that was as much a
welcome to Mrs. Peter Moore, of
Colombo (she was Margaret Fairfax and
a former Doone girl), as an end-of-the-
term jubilation. A striking part of the
entertainment was a fashion parade by
the girls who take dressmaking classes
when expert needlewomen from fif-
teen upwards swanked gaily about
the lawn in day and evening frocks
and sports outfits. Lots of the mothers
and aunts looked on blushfully, confess
ing to entire ignorance of dress architec-
ture, though they were a very smartly-
turned-out crowd. Mrs. Peter Moore flew
a green scarf with her cream cloth tailor-
ings, and later went on with her mother,
Mrs. Wilfred Fairfax, to Mrs. Hugh
Gordon’s party at the Rose Bay Golf
Club. The Ernest Watts, Alexander Gor-
don’s lady, Mrs. W. McKay, Bea Mc-
Donald, Mrs. Harry Budge, in a grass-
green coat of military cut; Mrs. Norman
Lowe, showing a dash of tartan on her
brown outfit, and Mrs. Sterling Levis, in
black, were among the crowds in the gar-
dens and the reception-rooms.
There were a kangaroo and an emu
guarding the stairs of “The Squatter’s
Daughter’s” ballroom when that young
lady gave her dance last week. This was to
aid Prince Alfred’s, and was also a neat
bit of publicity for Cinesound. The Ken
Halls and the Dan Carrolls and such-
like film magnates were early arrivals,
and Jocelyn Howarth, the star of the
picture, attracted all eyes in a clinging
white crepe frock the tiny coat of which
ballooned into tulle sleeves. Dr. Garnet
Halloran’s wife was president of the suc-
cess and looked satisfaction in powder-
blue laces. Margery Ward, the organis-
ing secretary, went ruffled in Swiss mus-
lin, while secretary Enid Lach-Szyrma
shimmered in parchment satin. During
the evening boys and girls who looked as
though they were the makings of film
stars were picked out from among the
dancers ; blonde, brunette, comedy and
character types, they will be given screen
tests by Cinesound.
Mrs. Frank Harvey, who was Bobbie
McMillan, is another who has returned
to her native land. She arrived by the
Orama, bringing small daughter Helen
with her, and the two will for the pre-
sent stay with Dr. and Mrs. Watson
Munro, so that the latter will have the
chance to make acquaintance with her
small granddaughter. Frank has come
to Australia to take part in “Sheep-
mates,” a forthcoming Australian talkie.
Before the war Parramatta was famous
for its dances. Recently some bright
souls sought to re-create the atmosphere
of 19 years ago and collected about 120
of those pre-war dancers. Even the genial
“Mich,” who confessed to 53 years’ work
round the Town Hall, was dug out of his
retirement, donned his old uniform and
acted once more as cloak-room attendant.
The evergreen Bort Fahy at the piano
played all the old familiar waltzes and
tunes full of melody without the awful
wails and shrieks of modern dance music.
Da Silva Waugh was the only one present
of the old-time secretaries, some having
been killed in action, and others scat-
tered all over the world. It was a great
reunion.
This is the latest photograph of Maud
Sherwood, the clever artist, whose oil-
painting “Viterbo,” and one of the flower-
pieces have just been bought by the
National Gallery. Maud is a Maori-
lander by birth, but had lived for
some years in Australia before she went
to Europe in 1925. She was then con-
sidered one of the best of our artists, an
opinion which her recent show in the
Macquarie Galleries has strengthened.
While in Europe Mrs. Sherwood exhi-
bited at the leading salons ; one of the
most vivid of the canvases she brought
back, “The Yellow and Blue Sail,” was
shown at the last Paris Salon. A Peter
Pan photo.
Mrs. Byron Beans is looking forward
to the promised visit of daughter Mar-
garet Honey, now Mrs. Harry Hodson.
Margaret, since her whirlwind wooing
and wedding, lives in England and mixes,
every week-end, with belted earls and
their ladies when she is not right up
among the strawberry leaves and frolick-
ing with duchesses. New friends are
members of the Brand family, sons and
daughters of the Viscount Hampden who
was one-time Governor of N. S. Wales.
One of the Sydney girl’s greatest thrills
was being seated at a table next to that
of Royalty at some charity affair in one
of England’s stately homes. The Duke
and Duchess of York and the Duke of
Gloucester were there, and with them
was screen star Norma Shearer, very
lovely in a sheer white frock.
A group of girls in evening frocks, as
gay and varicolored as sweet-peas in a
garden, were the choral background for
Marie Bremner’s simple black dress and
fresh voice last week, when the A.B.C.
broadcast “The New Moon.” There was
quite an audience in the studio, and with
the orchestra, the grand piano and the
songbirds it was an overflow house.
The widely-known and -loved Mrs.
Florence Zabel had a swift passing last
week. Suffering from a cold, she left her
library in Rowe-street early and reached
her Darlinghurst boarding-house in time
for a bath and a rest before the business
of dressing for the evening. An hour or
so later, a friend called in to see her
and found her lying back against the
pillows of her bed, an open book still
in her hands. Mrs. Zabel was one of
those librarians that Christopher Morley
might have dreamed of, and her mind
wore as its tiara the gems of English
literature. She came to Sydney, by way
of Europe, from Westralia.
An enthralled audience listened to
Sarqh Hynes’s lecture on Keats in
the Forum Club ; for here was one
who had trod the same paths as Adonais
and his Fanny Brawn. As a girl, Miss
Hynes lived in the house that had been
Keats’s home, and this was next door
to the dwelling of the young poet’s un-
imaginative lady love.
This Letter went along with many
others to the Independents’ spine-curler,
“Musical Chairs,” on Saturday night. It
is a salad (rather green) of Russian drama
flavored by Galician oil wells, and it is
mostly gloom punctuated by the intense
piano-playing of an objectionable young
man who, for no apparent reason, is a
regular sheik among the girls. The
attractive things about the play are
Jane Connolly’s red hair, Eva Kuraz s
pretty legs, which, as the peasant servant
girl, she wears bare, and Marie Rosen-
feld’s figure, which is seen in five com-
pletely different outfits.
Hebrew, Yiddish and Men were the
three unusual features of the 10th birth-
day party of the National Council of
Jewish women. There was Hebrew grace
offered by Rabbi Einfield, there was a
speech of congratulation in Yiddish by
Polish poet Malech Ravitch, and the
men squired their womenfolk and were
active partners in the dance that fol-
lowed. Dr. Fanny Reading, who is the
national president, and Mrs. Victor
Cornfield, another chieftainess, were the
queen bees of the evening, and congratu-
latory speeches were made by male and
female heads of Jewry.
Agnes McLeod, daughter of the late
Neil McLeod, and of Mrs. McLeod, of
Goolagong, near Cowra, has become en-
gaged to Richard Fair, better known by
his screen and stage name of Grant
Lyndsay. The lucky man plays juyentle
lead in “The Squatter’s and
also appeared in “On Our Selection.

REV. W. ROWLANDS,
Younger Crescent, Caulfield,
S.E.B, Melbourne.
Melbourne
Chatter
At Caulfield on Saturday the tempera-
ture was mild and genial. As a result
feminine dressing included a brave array
of organdie, muslin and other diaphanous
materials—collars, capes, bows and other
neck adornment, white and in checks.
Though the skies belied the thermometer
and threatened rain, there was an out-
crop of small flat hats made of the same
fragile stuff. Luckily for the wearers the
rain held off. Cautious women favored
tailored suits of some dark hue, usually
relieved by a white vest, jabot or collar
or a flower on the coat lapel. Mrs. Ben
Chaffey, wife of the chairman of the
V. and Mrs. James Purves, who
added pointed fox furs, were among the
wearers of tweed. Mrs. McColl Mc-
Cowan topped her black costume with
a white felt hat. Mrs. A. Hyde, all in
brown, had with her Peggy Horne, from
Adelaide, whose black cloth coat was
topped with a black velvet toque. Mrs.
W. Lempriere was smart in French blue
sand cloth and a deeper-hued felt hat.
With her was Mrs. W. Massey Burn-
side, whose dressing and millinery
mingled fawn and brown. Mrs. R. M.
Ranking, from England, chose a coat of
squirrel fur with a contrasting hat. Mrs.
H. J. Robertson’s light tweed suit was
metal grey.
The Melbourne Hunt Club had a
beautiful day for its race-meeting at
Moonee Valley, but the weather is still
prone to midwinter lapses, and feminine
dressing was a matter of tailored suits
and warm wraps. The Master of the
hunt, C. C. Moore, was present, also
General Johnston and his daughter, Mrs.
Ken Moore, and the other three hunt
clubs sent along substantial contingents.
Some 400 dancers gathered on the
broad deck of the Westralia for a hop
to aid the Missions to Seamen. Cap-
tain Darroch, with his wife, who wore
black lace, lent a hand in running the
function ; likewise some of the officers.
The ship was trimmed with bunting and
gay streamers. Secretaries of the jollo
were Stephanie Lord and Betty Falkiner,
who wore pretty black frocks, and Mrs.
Trevor Crawford, whose white gown was
of delustred satin.
Members of the Little Theatre organ-
isation held their hop at the Rex. Sev-
eral folk came in fancy dress, and bal-
loons contributed to the gala atmo-
sphere. Mrs. L. James, from Sydney,
was in a pink gown trimmed with silver
that followed the mode of the early
’nineties. Mrs. W. Mitchell sported
modern draperies of pale lilac lace. Mrs.
George Haines sported peach-pink organ-
die, flared of skirt; Dora Flateau was
in silver lame. The couple chosen to
represent Australia at Hollywood—
Gwen Munro and Brian Norman, of
Sydney, were host and hostess of the
function.
Competitions on the links and a card
party, engineered by the Brighton Golf
Club, netted £42 for the club’s cot at
the Frankston Children’s Hospital. The
associates, led by Mrs. M. Ewing, con-
ducted the bridge gathering and some
bazaar stalls.
There was an attendance of 1000 at
Prestige, Ltd.’s staff ball, staged at the
Wattle Path, St. Kilda, in cabaret form.
Official guests were G. Foletta, g.m. of
the firm, and Mrs. Foletta, wearing a
gown of garnet-red crushed velvet and
carrying a presentation posy. Also in
the party were R. Fawcett, secretary of
the co., and Mrs. Fawcett; L. Gough,
factory manager, and Mrs. Gough ; p’
Hall, chairman of the Social Club, and
Mrs. Hall; the J. B. Larkins and Mr.
and Mrs. R. Pasker.
Members of the International Club
met over the four-o’clock brew to honor
the Consul-General for China, Dr. Chen,
a visitor from Sydney. Prof. Harrison
Moore, chairman of the League of
Nations Union, welcomed the distin-
guished guest. The Rev. C. W.
Kong, who has been in Melbourne
six years and is returning to China
in October, was another special guest
that afternoon. Harrison Moore’s lady
and Mrs. Arthur Norman were the
hostesses of the gathering, and Mrs. Guy
Bakewell, with some members of the
League of Nations Youth movement,
boiled the billy.
At Earl’s Court, St. Kilda, officers of
the 29th Battalion held their ball. Lieut.-
Col. E. F. Lind, C. 0., and Mrs. Lind,
who wore black satin, extended the wel-
coming hand.
Students of Ormond held their ball, for
the first time, at the college. The master
of Ormond, D. K. Picken, with Mrs.
Picken, whose draperies were black
velvet, welcomed the guests, who in-
cluded the Warden of Trinity, Dr. J. C.
V. Behan, and Mrs. Behan, and the prin-
cipal of Janet Clarke Hall, Enid Joske.
Susie Tolhurst, garbed in black-and-
white raiment, was hostess of a billy-
boiling at her mother’s home, St. Kilda,
on Friday afternoon, at which visiting
golfers, here for the tournaments, were
entertained. In her social duties, Miss
Tolhurst had the support of her fiance,
Sloan Morpeth, of golfing fame, also
Mrs. Tolhurst, Mrs. J. Byrne and Shirley
Tolhurst.
Premier Argyle laid the foundation-
stone of the Mabel Brookes wing of
Queen Victoria Hospital, which will be
the new out-patients’ department. Its
name is a recognition of Mrs. Norman
Brookes’s long service as president of
the institution. Mrs. Brookes was down
with the ’flu and unable to be present,
but her husband and her daughter Elaine,
the lass in a smart ensemble of water-
melon-pink sand cloth, with a snow
leopard fur collar and a matching felt
hat, deputised for her. Mrs. John Suther-
land, the hospital’s hon. sec., received
official guests. The Argyle lady, in
tailored black suit with pointed fox furs
and small felt hat, accompanied her hus-
band.
An addition to Melbourne’s profes-
sional singers is Mrs. W. G. Burnett,
professionally known as Edith Elischer,
pictured here by Broothorn. Mrs. Bur-
nett arrived recently from England with
her husband. She has studied in Brus-
sels under Madame Dyna Beumer, and
in London under Signor Ernesto Baraldi
and Sir George Henschel, and her con-
cert career has included appearances at
the Albert Hall and engagements with
8.8. C. Lately her mother, Madame
Anna Elischer, a fine pianist, has joined
her. and the two artists have given a
joint recital.
Associates of the N.C.W. had an at-
home at Menzies’ on Thursday night, at
which the Weedon lady, in deep blue
moire velvet, presided. Constance Dun-
can, for some years connected with the
Y.W.C.A. in Japan, spoke of her life
there. Mollie Warden and John Hobbs
sang, and Alba Zacutti recited.
The English tenor Steuart Wilson was
guest of honor at the rooms of (he Music
Teachers’ Association, Kelvin Hall, on
Thursday night. Mr. Wilson gave a dis-
sertation on musical appreciation, and
Violet Semple sang. President H. S.
Elvins did the honors, and in the throng
were Mrs. Ethel Ashton, Carrie Cairn-
duff, Louis Lavater and Dr. H. S. Link.
Most powerful of Melbourne’s agen-
cies for giving a helping hand to the
unfortunate is the Lud Mayor’s Fund,
into which £750,000 has flowed in a de-
cade. Administrative expenses haven’t
exceeded 5 p.c., and E. Glanville Hicks,
pictured here, knows why. He has been
the administrator. After 10 years of
service he has been granted three months’
leave of absence, and will devote his holi-
day to a trip to England to spend Christ-
mas with his daughter Peggy, who lives
in London, and to help celebrate her 21st
birthday. Peggy, after winning the Car-
lotta Rowe Scholarship of the R.C.M.,
is studying music-composition under the
tutelage of Vaughan Williams, and piano
under Arthur Benjamin. Mr. Hicks, who
is a journalist—he had 18 years on the
“Argus”—recently published a book of
verses entitled “The Turn of the Tide.”
Queen’s College chapel was the scene
of the wedding of Margery, twin daugh-
ter of Mrs. F. J. Clarke, of Malvern,
and Edward Guy Williams of the same
locality. Attended by her sister Dorothy,
whose frock was of buttercup tint, the
bride faced the altar in the robe of deep
ivory velvet, with tulle veil and orange
buds.
Mrs. Fred Thiel has taken her little
granddaughters, Judy and June Chirn-
side, on a cruise to Noumea.
Perth’s springtime gaieties:
Colored gauze canopied the thousand
dancers of the Advertising Arts Ball at the
Embassy. Golden lights illumined the frieze
of advertisements that girded the balconies,
and the lounge was massed with streamers and
balloons. Organiser Baron Solomon’s wife
was there in reseda green lace. Mrs. H. L
Downe was in clinging black chiffon velvet;
Jo Reardon touched her burnt orange organdie
with black; dawn pink gleamed through Mrs
F. Fletcher’s silver lace; Mrs. J. Slattery threw
a pink velvet cape over her white chiffons;
Tess Smallpage danced in lipstick crinkle
crepe; Joyce Fuller trailed buttercup ninon
draperies, and Vi Hill combined black velvet
with marocain.
Town and country golfers were en masse at
the Royal Fremantle links to witness the final
of the women’s championship, played in teem-
ing rain. A glimpse of a lemon-silk waist
showed under L.G.U. vice-president Mrs
Meecham’s benedictine ensemble as she handed
the trophy to Mrs. Oscar Negus, who squeezed
the water from her nigger-brown outfit to
receive it. Runner-up Mrs. Reg McKissock
dripped water from her blue and greys as she
applauded the victory.
Mrs. Frank Davies, chairman of the Vic-
toria League, donned a walnut tweed ensemble
to serve tea at the Palace Hotel in honor of
the league’s visiting English members, Edith
Thompson, who sported jarrah-toned silk repp,
and Miss Hargreaves, whose green headpiece
matched the flecks in her tweed costume.
“Hamlet” in modern dress was the Reper-
tory Club’s latest offering to its patrons, but
most of the players conceded something to
tradition. John Brooks soliloquised in black,
and Joyce Mortlock’s crimson velvets were fit-
ting for the Queen of Denmark. Laurel Berry-
man, as Ophelia, went mad in flowing white
lace. The play unabridged occupied nearly
four hours.
Green ribbons tied gifts to a line strung
across a poppy-adorned room when Mrs. Bill
Cromellin, clad in Atlantic blue and white,
gave a party lor Joan Newbury, who is shortly
to become Mrs. Tony Taylor. Mollie Taylor,
Mollie Newbury and Yvonne Renou were there,
chatting eagerly about their ’maids’ frocks.
Twenty-two debs, flaunted their white satins,
laces, velvets, crepes and chiffons when they
bowed over their posies to the coadjutor-
archbishop at the Sacred Heart High School
Ball. Mrs. R. V. McDonough’s sapphire-blue
and Mrs. E. Conway’s burgundy laces swayed
beside the official guests as they trekked to
the dais. The Mitchell lady’s black satin showed
a suggestion of beige lace; Mrs. Kerr Pearse’s
black Chantilly was seen near Mrs. E. B.
Sinclair’s prairie green creation; Nell Bryant
tripped in pastel-blue ninon; Joy Wilson chose
similar toned satin and Eileen Willcock billow-
ing pink floral taffetas.
Adelaide’s social round:
Lady Hore-Ruthven, all in brown, opened
an American tea organised by the women’s
committee of the Institution for the Blind.
She was received by Mrs. J. Stanley Verco,
president of the committee, and A. A. L.
Rowley, treasurer of the institution.
Over 400 guests were received by Rev.
Brother Mackey, the principal, at the dance
held at Rostrevor College. The floral decora-
tions were gorgeous. Chief engineers of the
jollo were Mrs. H. A. Lewis, Mrs. W. J.
Denny, Mrs. W. Little and Mrs. John Hill.
Visiting teams were entertained at a dance
given by the Adelaide Basketball Club. The
guests were received by Mrs. Harvey Johnston,
in apricot-embossed velvet, and Joan Harris,
who was in white chiffon.
An afternoon tea at the Unemployed Sales
Depot in Gawler-place raised over £25. It
was organised by the chairman, General S.
Price Weir, and executive committee. Lady
Hore-Ruthven accepted an invitation, and was
received by Mrs. Lavington Bonython. The
guests made extensive purchases.
Hobart continues to welcome the v.-r.
Clarks: —
The Victoria League staged its reception to
the new Governor and his wife in the
Mayor’s courtroom. Boughs of pink almond
and Japanese peach in tall vases made effective
decoration. League president Elliott Lewis and
his lady, A. G. Kemp, president of the Royal
Empire League, and Mrs. Goddard, the
League’s sec., met the v.-r. party. Lady
Clark’s black, fur-trimmed coat was topped by
a hat in fuchsia shades.
For the Lyceum Club’s reception to Lady
Clark the rooms were gay with spring blossoms.
John Downie, the C.J.’s lady, did the honors,
with the Mayoress and other members of the
committee. A welcome ode composed by Miss
Gertrude Adams was sung, and there was other
music.
The women graduates turned the Uni. library
into a drawing-room for their party in honor
of Lady Clark. Miss Walter, president of the
W.G.A., supported by Miss Mahoney and
Merle Weaver, received her Ex. Guests included
Mrs. Stops, wife of the Chancellor, and Mrs.
Tom Murdoch.
The inter-’Varsity debates have provided
Hobart with entertainment. His Ex. presided
at one of them. Five States sent men only,
but the Perth team included two women, who
justified their inclusion. The visitors had a
jolly time with dances after every debate and
day-time jaunts that included a tea party at
Government House.
The Garrison Artillery Ball in the drill hall
was a well-managed affair. Mayor and
Mayoress Perkins were host and hostess, and
the v.-r. Clarks smiled on the proceedings,
being accommodated at the top of the hall,
which was furnished as a lounge. Strings of
colored lights and decorations in the company’s
colors, maroon and blue, made the setting.
The Howard Buchanan girls, Margaret and
Joan, whose birthdays fall on the same date,
celebrated the anniversaries at a dance at their
home, Sandy Bay. Birthday cakes with 20
candles on one and 19 on the other were on
the table at supper. Pretty frocks and pretty
faces graced the party.
Those brainy women Misses A. E. and R.
Lane, of Lindisfarne, collaborated to produce
a comic operetta, “Harem Scarum,” for the
benefit of the local Regatta Association. Their
brother Norman was producer and the local
hall was packed to the doors.
Betty Giblin is expected home in October,
after a long visit to her sister, Mrs. Lethbridge,
in the Cold Country and a later sojourn at
Simonstown, S. Africa.

BRANCH SERVICE
FROM CHINA TO PERU.
Papua’s Administration has discovered
that its practice of compelling the new
arrival to put down a cash deposit is
illegal. Regulations have been issued
to straighten out the matter ; they demand
£3O or a sufficient guarantee, the money
to be held for 18 months and then re-
turned. If an immigrant should depart
before the term is up he also gets his
cash back, provided he is “not destitute.”
If he is, big fella Gubament hangs on
to the money, which seems paradoxical,
even for Papua.

At a time when grand opera is an im-
possible proposition in Australia, it is
interesting to note the number of Aus-
tralians in the Metropolitan Opera Co.
formed in England to provide opera at
prices ranging from Is. 9d. to Bs. Among
them are Florence Austral, Horace
Stevens, Browning Mummery, Florence
Easton and Muriel Brunskill ; and one
of the conductors is Aylmer Buesst, who
also hails from these parts.

The death, at 45, of R. H. Stevens, gen-
eral manager of the Broken Hill, Rho-
desia, removed an outstanding metallur-
gist, especially in base metals. He was
one of the band of young Americans
who went to Risdon, Tasmania, under
H. W. Gepp, to build up the zinc indus-
try in Australia. Several Australians
trained under him are holding Australia’s
end up in India, Africa, South and North
America and Britain. Stevens left Ris-
don in 1925 to take his last job.

“Lex”: In England a motorist was
fined recently for failing to maintain his
tyres in such a condition as to be free
from defects likely to cause damage. In
Australia many motorists otherwise keen
about the efficiency of their cars use
tyres which are a danger to driver and
public. A burst tyre usually means an
accident, and very often a skid, which
may involve pedestrians as well as the
car-owner. A little legislation on the
English lines referred to would do no
harm here.
* * * *
“Seljuk”: What the Norwegians have
done in banning smoking by motor-car
drivers (B. 9/8/’33) is a circumstance to
some recent Turkish regulations. In
future licenses will be issued only to men
of 25 years and over. These must also be
married, the idea being that the married
man is more likely to watch his step than
the gay young single dog, and thus help
to lower the accident rate. This is very
high, as most people who have had ex-
perience of driving through crowds of
Asiatic pedestrians can easily believe.

Lyttelton (M.L.) is a constituency
which sticks to its representatives until
they die. When it was part of Alearoa
electorate John Joyce was member, and
member he stayed till he died in 1899.
George Laurenson succeeded him, and
stayed member until he died in 1913.
Jimmy McCombs, who followed Lauren-
son, died recently, still member for
Lyttelton. McCombs was born in Ire-
land of Scottish parents, and arrived in
the Shaky Isles at the age of three. He
studied for the Anglican ministry, but
found a more congenial field in politics
and became a draper while waiting for a
Parliamentary career. Experience as a
trade-union official made him a Laborite.
He was his party’s best handler of figures,
and his sincerity was tremendous. He
lacked geniality, and made fewer jokes
on the platform or in Parliament than
any other politician of his time, but was
the terror of Finance Ministers who
wanted to cover something in a Budget.

“The Dip”: Much publicity has been
accorded to the discovery by Sydney’s
C. 1.8. experts that the finger-prints of man
and ape are almost identical. Just how it
is going to facilitate the detection of
crooks isn’t clear, but in any case the
gentlemen who deal in loops and whorls
are a century behind the times. At
Breslau in 1823 Purkenje, the medico who
was the first man to discuss finger-prints
at length, read a thesis in which he dealt
exhaustively with both the prints of men
and monkeys ; and 45 years later Allix
published numerous drawings of the
hands of monkeys. Every subsequent
investigator has tried his hand at finger-
printing the ape. Incidentally, other ani-
mals also possess finger-prints, though
they are less pronounced. The most
beautiful pattern, consisting of neat trans-
verse ridges, is to be found on the naked
concave part of the prehensile tail, serv.-
ing as a fifth hand, of the Howling Mon-
key.
* * * *
“Canny Lad”: An interesting position
recently arose in the North of England
when the Queensland Rugby League
footballer Moores, whose contract with
Leeds club was about to expire, was
placed on the club’s transfer list for sale,
a practice which has not hitherto been
applied to Australians. It is stated that
Moores has now signed up with York
for £750, but whether this is a personal
retainer or a transfer fee is not clear. If
the latter, he will get only 10 p.c., his
former club pouching the balance.
* * * *
“Shrewsbury”: This being the verge
of the professional Soccer season in Brit-
ain some details of the prices paid for
players “transferred” last May are com-
ing to hand. Aston Villa has paid Black-
burn Rovers £5OOO for one Dix. It may
be all right, but anyone familiar with the
Lancashire folk of Blackburn will wonder
just what is the matter with Dix. This
is the 30th sum of £5OOO and over paid
for players by the English clubs within
the past few years.
* * * *
“Aigburth”: A chuckleheaded sugges-
tion has been made by someone that in
1936 a team chosen from Australia, South
Africa, West Indies, India and Maori-
land should engage the Old Dart in an
Empire match. The selection of such a
side would give infinite trouble, and the
question of paying the piper even more.
We had a fair instance of an Empire
team playing Australia last year, and the
resulting rumpus still echoes in our ears.

Matey is the only word to describe
the cruises that are now raging up and
down the Seven Seas. A dowager
duchess had a dashing neighbor at the
dinner-table who turned up nightly in
rose-pink and gold tissue ball frocks.
The first night out the dashing one gave
the dowager duchess a pat. “I’m glad to
have found a girl friend for the voyage,”
'she said heartily as she was whisked off
to dance. The prim older woman at first
looked coldly offended. Then she laughed
and waved a hand to the backward-gaz-
ing rosy one. To another passenger the
next evening the rose-pink lass remarked,
“I’m going to see that the dear old thing
has the time of her life. She needs bring-
ing out. I must get her some dance part-
ners.” The rosy one was as good as her
word, and sat out half her dances, beam-
ing with gratification while the older
woman staggered through many a fox-
trot she’d rather have done without. Each
glowed in the belief she was adding to
the other’s enjoyment.


The Yellow River.
BY OSMAR E. WHITE.
IN a heap of abandoned gear by the
water-tank 1 found that which I
sought officially—“knowledge of the
district.”
Fletcher had passed that heap of rub-
bish a score of times in three years of
patrolling from Boaimai to the Ne-Aut
village. Never once had he given it more
than a cursory glance. But then Fletcher
was singularly incurious by reason of
long and bitter years of experience in the
Administrative service of the Mandated
Territory. Long ago he had attained
the Fifth Kingdom of the patrol-officer.
His knowledge of the district was more
than profound—it was complete.
But I had never seen the yellow river
at Dogura before that rainy April day
when the Government schooner hove in
sight of Cape Lawn, and it was natural
that 1 should want to investigate every-
thing very carefully—even to the rubbish
heaps.
Dogura and its long lines of dying
cocoanut-trees, its air of luxuriant rot-
tenness, invited interest and conjecture—
just as did those blank, green walls of
mountain foliage in the south-west, and
the tawny, sluggish river crawling down
from God-knows-where....
Yes. I found it in a rubbish heap,
with a broken Martini rifle, a topee and
the remains of a drill jacket; and I bore
it away with me to where Fletcher sat
frowning over his calculations of the
year’s head tax.
“What have you got there?” he
queried, looking up.
“Don’t know yet,” I replied, “but it
looks like a book of sorts. The mould
has eaten it.”
He merely grunted and set to scrib-
bling figures again.
I gingerly cut away the damp leather
from the clasp. For half an inch of their
thickness the pages were rotten, and only
one in twenty written words was de-
cipherable.
It was obviously a diary, irregularly
kept, and half-filled with figure nota-
tions. Here and there one could make
out a name, “Myra,” “Kikani,” or a sen-
tence. With some difficulty I traced the
block letters on the inside cover.
“Know a man by the name of Ken-
neth Haldane, Fletcher?” T asked, look-
ing up.
“Used to be owner here,” he grunted.
“But do shut up for a minute. Five
eights are forty, and seven.... Can’t you
see I’m busy?”
Here in the middle the paper was
better preserved, and I could make out
whole passages. For example:
“Dobney expected to-morrow. Myra
very busy sprucing up the house, but has
had trouble with the new boy. I am
sending out 14 tons smoke-dried and 5
tons sun-dried. Bags ready stacked.
“Rather rough. Last week very hot.
M. doesn’t look too well, but will pro-
bably pick up when the weather breaks.
The kunai is very bad among the trees
put down four years ago off Nipa Point.”
It was not, however, until the entry
dated September 18 that the text became
clear and unbroken. For about thirty
pages it continued —a neat, precise hand-
writing which became even more neat
and precise as it went on, until sud-
dently it trailed away into patches of
blurred indelible pencil.
Because that isolated passage in the
diary of the man I shall call Kenneth
Haldane portrays the very spirit of
Dogura’s yellow river, I shall set it down
—word for word. On the table before
me is the rotting book itself ; and in my
mind’s eye is the image of a sluggish,
muddy river moving down from the
eternal hills to the eternal sea.
* * * *
“September 18. —I have neglected en-
tries this month because it seemed that
there was nothing legitimate to enter.
This was intended to be useful merely
as a record of arrivals or departures,
events which one might find it interest-
ing to place at some later date.
“To-night, however, the temptation to
talk aloud is strong. It is annoying be-
cause.... Well, I shall try writing in-
stead. This sense of unreality will no
doubt pass off as loneliness loses its
novelty.
“Myra went out by the trade schooner
a week ago. I do not know why I did
not make an entry of the fact that night.
She plans to stay at least a year, which
is really very wise. I believe that my
behavior was quite cheerful and that,
on her part, she was divided between
regret of leaving me to fend for myself
and the happiness of starting on her
long-promised holiday. It means a great
deal to her —the society of white women,
other men dances, shops, pretty
things.
"I am to join her on 'long leave’ in
March. At least, that is the little pre-
tence we have tacitly agreed to keep up
between us. She must know, as well as
1 do, that I could not possibly afford to
keep an overseer here for one month,
let alone six.
“The weather is still very hot. It is
just as well Myra left before the river
comes down in flood. That is always
an unpleasant time here, and to-day the
rain clouds are banking against Mount
Bellenger—big, puffy balloons of purple.
But the river is the same. Year in and
year out it is the same, even when swol-
len. It is broad and yellow and lazy.
It never hurries. That is why I dislike
it so intensely. A moment’s deliberate
slowness suggests strength. An eternity
of slowness suggests omnipotence.
“Fancies apart, I think something
rummy has happened up in the hills.
Every freshet that comes down brings
a new deposit of yellow silt which
smothers the bankside trees. Perhaps
there has been an eruption somewhere
along the Kaiserin Range. One can see
the old cones from here.
“Jerningham made it very clear when I
casually mentioned prospecting to him
last patrol that the Kaiserins are uncon-
trolled territory, and that the man who
goes into them can expect what he gets.
It’s near the Dutch line, so I expect he’s
right. 1 guess rummier things than vol-
canic eruptions happen in Tugeri
country. „
“Once upon a time I used to have an
ambition to make a trip up river, but
that is one of many ambitions which
have died peacefully. In any case the
river devil-devil would take any attempt
at investigation of his domain as a per-
sonal affront. At least, that’s what
Tukoko says. He’s boss-boy and ought
to know. Funny devils, niggers. I some-
times think that it is only because we
don’t know enough about this country
that we fail to appreciate its beliefs.
“Wonder how I’ll take it if those four-
year-old trees on Nipa Point fail to
bear? The mature groves yielded only
ten bob a tree last year. Why don’t the
Government johnnies on the experiment
farm at Rabaul do something about bole
rot?
“September 24. —Went up as far as
Darega Point to-day and have just
landed back.
“I miss Myra. The ‘wet’ has set in
with a vengeance, but it seems just as
hot as ever. Come to think of it, the
climate is like that. You look forward
to the ‘wet’ in hopes....and you look
forward to the ‘dry’ in hopes. The hopes
never come off. It is a land of unreal-
ised promises.
“A big freshet came down this morn-
ing, and the stream has risen four feet,
but it is just as lazy as ever. All sorts
of rubbish are rolling quietly out to sea
...limbs of trees, uprooted nipa and
sac-sac; even palm-thatches with smoke-
blackened uprights attached. I always
thought river-niggers built above the
flood level.
“I’m glad Myra went. I wonder how
she stuck it out for so long. For my-
self. .. .well, I’ve had a long time to get
used to it; and I didn’t notice so much
when she was here —even when things
didn’t go smoothly. She was there to
speak to when I wanted to speak, and
there to watch when I wanted to watch.
Maybe I didn’t want to speak often
enough, but there was so little to say.
“She used to complain about me being
a silent, moodV beggar... .but only when
she was fed up and had forgotten the
point. Women are different. A man
prefers to have the obvious taken for
granted, but a woman wants it discussed.
There seems to be room for a deal of
misunderstanding between those two atti-
tudes —particularly when the people con-
cerned want to do the right things and
meet half-way.
“1 can only hope that things will be
better all round when she comes back.
But I don’t know that any hope has a
reasonable chance of fulfilment here.
For nine years not one hope I have en-
tertained —save alone that of marrying
Myra—has been justified. And it would
have been far better if I had not mar-
ried her. I don’t know what difference
twelve months can make.
“Weeding on Nipa Point has kept the
gangs so busy that the scrub behind the
house is getting away from me. Already
kareela and arsenic vines are invading
the flower-beds Myra put down in the
shade of the drying-shed. Just now they
are only small, delicate tendrils of green,
but by the time the rain lets up they
will have overrun everything.
“She would be angry if she knew I
hadn’t cut them back. I promised I
would. I have promised a lot of things.
“September 26. —Usual wet weather
trouble with the coons, but a kick or
two in the backside fixed it. Otherwise
not much doing beyond the usual routine
of weeding and chipping.
“September 28.—The river has risen
ten feet eight inches in the last twenty-
four hours. All the haulage tracks are
under water and work is at a standstill.
From Nipa Point to Beachy the stream
is a mile wide, and I can’t get down to
see about those young trees. I tried wad-
ing this morning, but soon gave up.
“The crocodiles have come up in hun-
dreds. Tukoko tells me one of them
took Makik’s four-year-old kid last
night. I’m sorry. He was a jolly little
beggar and not nearly as lousy as most.
A great pet of Myra’s.
“The ditches are alive with slimy bodies
and they are wriggling out on to the
swamped cultivation.
“I don’t wish Myra was here. I’m
damned glad she isn’t. All the same,
I’d like to have someone to talk to.
Tukoko is such a damned fool.
“Don’t feel very bright to-day. Per-
haps the extra worry and the rotten con-
ditions have something to do with it, but
I’ve a suspicion there is a dose of fever
in the offing as well. Took 20 grains of
hydrochloride, and am seeing pink
spiders to-night. Still, it might hang off
for a while... .until the river goes down,
anyway.
“September 30. —Flood a record—3o
feet 9 inches over the high-water mark.
“AH the fields are under water, and
the crocs, are after the drowned pigs in
Dogura. There seems to be little or no
chance for the trees on the point. Drift-
wood will have broken them off or
stripped the bark.
“The villagers evacuated early this
morning, and came up here. Hut-
thatches are drifting about over the
swamped fields, and some have already
gone downstream. The yam-houses have
been destroyed. Now there is no stored
food, and unless the villagers make off
into the bush they will starve.
“I was forced to issue a sago ration
this afternoon, as some of the old people
are very weak, and I will see what I
can spare in the morning.
“About four hundred tribesmen are
camped in the labor-lines, and the re-
cruits think it’s a great joke. They are
roasting the sago in earthenware pots
and making ‘big-feller sing-sing.’ It looks
like hell to me. They have raked out
old duk-duk head-dresses and are danc-
ing round the flames of a driftwood bon-
fire. I can hear the rain hissing on the
coals and see the steam rising from four
hundred black, mud-daubed bodies.
“Those dancing devils will laugh the
other side of their faces when the rice
and sago give out!
“October 3. —Shot a fifteen-foot croco-
dile outside the compound fence this
morning. A girl was taken in the night.
It must have crawled right into the lines
after her.
“This is the limit —almost. I’m feel-
ing terribly rocky, and I am afraid the
quinine won’t last. One hundred and
twenty-five grains in three days I’ll
kill myself at this rate.
“Still raining. The river is up another
eight feet and still rising slowly. It’s in-
credible. Dogura is an island in a delta
twenty miles wide now. But, most in-
credible of all, the river is just the same
river, lazy and unhurried. It has merely
grown to a hundred times its normal
size.
“A big death-canoe came down from
some up-river village to-day. it was all
decked out in scarlet tappa cloth. The
crocodiles were swimming round it in
dozens trying to capsize it.
“I must keep going.
“More villagers came up for rations,
but I had to refuse, and there may be
trouble. They are camped on the high
ground above the flooded village, and
are holding big dances to propitiate the
river devils—between times raiding the
trees for green cocoanuts. If they take
it in their heads to raid the Dogura
pigs there will be bloody war here.
“Last night I cut down the sago by
half, in hopes that the Doguras would
be hungry enough to kill some of those
tantalising pigs. So far they have re-
frained. It would be like eating gilt-
edged securities. The pigs are the only
possession the flood has left them.
“Can’t see the far side of the river
to-day. It is blended into the yellow mist
and the falling rain. Falling in sheets, it
is—not like the opening of the usual
‘wet,’ but coming down with an all-per-
vading roar that doesn’t vary.
“The frogs are having a great time-
massed choirs on the verandah. Did
anyone ever compose the Frog Song? It
might be a great symphony, that... .with
an obbligato by nine hundred massed
and muffled kettledrums. Flood effects.
Mad fiddles soaring an allegro. Pulsing
discord. Christ! What a horrible idea....
The fiddles are in my own head.. . .
“I dreamed about Myra last night. She
came to the foot of my bed and stood
there, looking. She was in a green dress
and was flushed, as though she had been
dancing. There was nothing else. She
just stood there, looking at me.
“I don't think she will come back
next year. I am sure she won’t. She
would be more than human if she could
force herself to come. 1 would be less
than human if I demanded it.
“Ideas are tangled in my head to-night
—fighting. I can’t think things out with
this infernal racket going on. The pigs
in the compound have started squealing
again and I want to go to sleep.
“The diarist! Pepys said : ‘And so to
bed.’ But it’s damp and mouldy. Did
Pepys ever say anything about a damp,
mouldy bed? I seem to remember some-
thing about a warming-pan. Hell.
“October 10. —There is nothing left of
the grove on Nipa Point—nothing but
splintered stumps and draggled fronds,
half buried in the silt.
“I am ill and very tired.
“But soon the weeds will have overrun
the scar by the river bank, and a field of
lush kunai will grow, as it grew in the
beginning. That is more important, per-
haps. than the fulfilment of my own
plan.... nine neat rows of trees hemmed
in on all sides by the confusion of the
jungle.
“The gods of the country have had
their own way in the garden, too. The
cabbages have grown into rank monsters
five feet tall, and Myra’s balsams project
through a matting of kareela, with blos-
soms a handbreadth across. The gods
of the country are indeed very, wonderful.
“This morning 1 went down to the
landing stage and looked up the river.
It is yellow, lazy, obscene in its delivery
from the hills. It is a caricature of Birth.
But I lived back and saw it as I saw it
nine years ago. Its banks were green
with shooting mangrove, its surface softly
tawny. All the growth there was hurry-
ing, and there were little, new blossoms
on the nightshade vines.
“The sky was blue. The white clouds
were grouped, rolling, round the summit
of Bellenger. So clear was the air that
I could see the snow on the high peaks
of the Bismarcks —and the hills in front
were purple, folded one into the other.
“When I came here, nine years ago, I
saw that there was but one step to be
made along the road to attainment. Until
to-day I believed that hard work, a level
head and the will to ignore obstacles
would prepare me to make that step. Yet
to-day I saw the river as it is—as it has
become to me. All the mightiness of God
is in its gait. I know that the prospect
of attainment is no further and no nearer
than it has ever been.
“I am become clear-sighted and see
myself. There is strong hope in me and
reason for that hope. It is not just a
blind believing in what cannot be, not
faith. There is fertility in this land of
mine such as I never dreamed of, yet by
that same labor to turn it to my use as
I set store by I have won from it —
nothing.
“Reason tells me that, as each crop
ripens, I may succeed. One good crop
and I can go away satisfied.... go to
Myra....sell a: a profit and honestly.
Or I may fail. But it is not failure that
I am afraid of, it is hope Hope, the
Old Man of the River, who sits astride
my shoulders, muttering ‘Faster!’
“Last night I thought that I would go
away from here, start all over again in
some place where Myra, my wife, would
be happy. .. .where I might dare to beget
children and.... But 1 do not want to go
after nine years, because attainment is
just beyond my outstretched hand, and
the river flows on, promising.
“To-morrow I am going out by myself,
in the launch.... Out to the purple hills
of fulfilment, along the yellow river of
hope. I shall not come back.”

Fletcher was still at his calculations
when I looked up from that first reading.
“What happened to Haldane?” I asked.
“How do you mean?”
“He’s dead, of course. But what was
the general idea of the business?”
“Dead?” exclaimed Fletcher, “God
bless my soul, no!
“What made you think that? Hal-
dane went up river and struck colors of
gold off Wilberforce Creek —by pure
accident, he declares. Now he spends
his days hoofing it after the rainbow.
Swears he’s on to another Edie Creek
if he can only trace the origin of the
Wilberforce Creek colors.
“It beats me how a man could be
fool enough to give up a beautiful piece
of ground like this to go into that stink-
ing back-country after gold that pro-
bably isn’t there. What made you think
he was dead?”
“My mistake,” I said quietly.
I looked through the broken window
pane and saw Haldane’s “yellow river of
hope” crawling lazily through the bank-
side groves. Its ripples were laughing in
the sun.

BY CON DREW.
I TOLD you fellers I once dabbled in
the wrestling game. There ain t goin’
to be any encore. If ever I fall for
wrestling again you can hand me a pass
for Nutville and tell me to come back
when I’m cured.
I’ll stick to managing fighters. It’s a
business I understand.
Everything would have been O.K. if
1 hadn’t bumped into Sam Ellis one after-
noon in Pitt-street.
Sam was a wrestling crank. Clean mad
on the game, Sam was. So when he
dragged me over to the side of the foot-
path I knew I was in for some mat talk.
“How would you like,” he says, “to
have a half-share in a sixteen-stone
grappler?”
“No thanks,” I says. “I know them
fellers. They push each other around
the ring until they get dizzy and then they
fall down and call it a draw.”
“This cove I’ve got is different,” says
Sam. “He ain’t been long enough in the
game to pick up the showman tricks.”
“He’ll soon learn,” says I.
“No, he won’t,” says Sam. “He can’t
speak more than a word or two of Eng-
lish. I picked him up one day when I
was prowlin’ around the wharves. And
strong! But you’d better come up to my
gym. and look him over.”
“Some other time,” I says, making to
move away, but Sam grabs me by the
elbow.
“Come now,” he says, “and you won’t
regret it. I tell you this chap is a real
bone-crusher. In a try-out last week he
threw two big blokes up in the air, and
they ain’t hardly come down yet. We’ll
clean up big money with him.”
Well, Sam put up such a good tale that
I let him lug me along to his gym., a
poky bit of a place above a fruit-shop.
When we got to the door I saw a great
big gorilla of a fellow whirling fifty-
pound dumbbells around his head as if
they were toy balloons. He dropped
them as we entered the room and
snatched up a bar of iron that must
have weighed half a ton.
“That’s him,” says Sam. “What do
you think of him?”
“He seems to be pretty strong,” I
allows.
“That’s nothin’, what he done just
now,” says Sam. “You want to see him
handling the big stuff. Yargus!” he
yells.
“Vot?” says the gorilla, dropping the
bar and coming over to us.
“I want you to show Mr. Silver that
double lift of yours.”
“Dooble leeft?” says the big monk,
scratching a head that looked as if it had
been hammered on to his shoulders with
a maul.
“Yes. That double lift you done for
me yesterday. You know what I mean.
Strong-man stuff. Show Mr. Silver.”
There’s two iron bars the size of the
Strathnaver’s anchor lying in the middle
of the floor. Yargus snatches them up
and swings them round his head for a
couple of minutes. Then he puts them
down and stretches himself and yawns.
“Is that any good?” asks Sam, looking
at me for applause.
“He’s strong all right,” I says, “but
he don’t seem to have a mammoth inter-
lect.”
“He ain’t too sound upstairs, I’ll admit,”
Sam comes back. “He don’t need to be
for wrestling. It ain’t like fighting, where
you do most of the work on your feet.
When a grappler’s got too many brains
he’s frightened to land on his dome for
fear of getting a headache. No, Yargus
ain’t a wizard ; but he can wrestle. And,
as I said before, he ain’t been taught any
schlenter tricks. If I matched him with
another boar-constrictor and told him
to do his best he’d do his best.”
“You’re sure of that, eh?”
“Absoloot sure.”
“I’ll tell you why I’m asking,” I says.
“There’s some who reckon that a
grappler could hide behind a cork-
screw.”
“Yargus’ll go straight.”
“All right,” I says. “There might be
something in him. Spring the proposi-
tion. 4 ’
“What I want to do,” says Sam, “is
to tune this feller up for a week or two
and then match him with a good second-
rater for a start. After he has beaten a
grappler or two he’ll be up amongst the
top-liners, and there’ll be big money in
him. To get him into top-hole condition
he’d have to be fed reg’lar and all the
rest of it. All that would cost money,
and I ain’t got any.’’
“I see,” I says. “You want to cast me
for the part of Chancellor of the
Cheques?”
“That’s it,” says Sam. “You provide
the coin to see the business through and
we’ll split the profits fifty-fifty.”
“Supposin’ there ain’t any profits?”
“Wotcha mean?”
“Supposin’ that ape of yours meets
someone better than himself first crack
out of the box and turns out to be a
dud?”
“He won’t meet nobody better than
himself and he won’t turn out a dud,”
says Sam. “Better come in on the scheme.
It’s as money-making as the Mint. Heard
of Mouritsky, haven’t you? Well, he’s
clearing a steady three-fifty a month at
Newtown.”
Well, to cut a long story short, l agreed
to find the dough ; and we set to work
with Yargus right away. I must admit
he showed us a pretty good track gallop.
For a wrestling partner we got him a
great big Swede with muscles on him like
a Roman gladiator. Yargus threw him
out of the ring we’d fixed up in the first
bout they had, and all but choked him
in the second.
When we pulled Yargus off, the
Swede’s neck looked like a barber’s pole.
He never came back no more and 1
didn’t blame him.
The next mat partner we got was an
Eyetalian. He looked something like
the heavyweight champ., Carnivorous,
only more savage.
“Now,” thinks I, “we’ll see the finest
scrap since the Rocks push won the
battle of Waterloo.”
I was out a mile in my reckoning. The
Eyetalian lasted exactly a minute and a
half. Yargus tied him into a bow knot
and it took us two minutes to undo him.
When we did get him disentangled he
lay out on his back as peaceful as a
pub after closing-time.
After that we steadied Yargus down
and made him act more gentle. If we
hadn’t done that we would have run out
of wrestling partners in a week.
And we would have run out of tucker,
too, if I hadn’t been well ribbed up with
coin. Eat! I’ve never seen a man who
could eat like Yargus. He could give a
starving nigger a side of mutton start
and beat him in a canter.
Well, we kept Yargus training for
about a month and then we thought it
was time we cashed in on him. There
was a Russian struttin’ around called
The Smolensk Snake. He was a stone
lighter than Yargus, but he could wrestle
a bit —at least he had accounted for a
few second-raters since coming to Aus-
tralia. Sam thought he would be just
the bloke to put Yargus up against, and
within a week the match was made.
The Snake’s connections wanted a
share-and-share-alike division of the
dough. Sam and I held out for sixty
per cent, for the winner, and we had our
way.
I was standing by when Sam told Yar-
gus he’d matched him with The Smolensk
Snake.
“Vere you say dat feller come from,
says Yargus, looking fierce.
“Smolensk,” Sam tells him. “It’s some
place in Bulgaria, I think.”
Yargus said something foreign that
sounded as if he was breaking all the
laws against obscene language. Then he
says to Sam: “I no like Smolensk
people.”
“Why don’t you like them?”
“Dey no dam goodt.”
“What’s wrong with them?” asks Sam.
“Dey no dam goodt at all,’ growls
Yargus. “I break dat feller’s neck. He
looked ugly enough to do it, too.
“That’s funny,” says Sam to me a bit
later. “I’ve never seen Yargus fly on
the handle before. Wonder what he s
got against the Smolensk crowd. Where
is Smolensk?”
“Search me,” I says. “Maybe their
different countries are at loggerheads.
What country is Yargus, anyway.
“A Lith—Lithyou—Lithography, or
something like that,” says Sam. Bu
what’s it matter what he is as long as ne
can wrestle?”
Well, we eased Yargus up in his train-
ing a day or two before the go, but we
couldn’t get him to ease up on the vitt es.
It didn’t matter, except to my roll,
the night he went in against The omo -
ensk Snake he was as fit as human han
could make him.
The place was packed. A big P

and ten bobs One-eyed Fred, my com-
missioner, invested a pony for me on
Vargus at evens and 4 to 5.
Yargus stalked into the ring, followed
by me and Sam, and seated himself in
his corner.
Then The Snake breezed in from the
opposite side of the ring. I’ll admit I
felt a twinge like trouble ahead when
I looked him over. He had a more in-
telligent dial than Yargus and he had
them foxy eyes that seem to look five
ways at once. His muscles were finely
developed, too, and he was well set on
his pins.
As soon as him and Yargus caught
sight of each other they glared like a
pair of hungry wolves. The Snake made
a move as if to commence hostilities
then and there; but his towel-swinger
grabbed his elbow and led him to his
seat.
“For two fellers who ain’t ever set
eyes on each other before,” Sam says,
“they certainly exhibit some brotherly
love.”
“If anyone’s killed,” I come back, “T
hope it ain’t Yargus.”
Then the referee came in and Sam and
me ducked out of the ring.
Just before they were ready to start
Sam leaned across the ropes and pulled
Yargus’s bathrobe off.
“You foller this chap round until you
get a head hold on him,” he says. “When
you catch hold of him don’t let go. Do
you follow me?”
“I unnerstan’,” growls Yargus; and
in another second the pair were at it.
Youse chaps don’t need to be told
what a scrap between two bulls is like.
Those blokes put up a battle that had
a bull argument beat to a frazzle.
First crack out of the box Yargus
snapped on a waist-hold and threw The
Snake clean over his head. The cove
from Smolensk hit the floor like a ton
of pig iron, but he was up again in a
second and he got a headlock on our
gorilla. It was pretty close to a strangle-
grip, let me tell you ; but it had no more
effect on Yargus than a snowdrop would
have on an Eskimo. He pulled his head
loose like you’d pull a cork from a
bottle, and slammed The Snake to the
mat.
Yargus was on top of his man in a
jiffy. He clamped on a body-scissors that
would have burst in the ribs of a cask.
The Snake did everything but tear him-
self in two trying to break the hold ;
but Yargus hung on.
“He’s got him!” yells Sam. “Stick
to him, Yargus!”
I thought Yargus had him, too, but we
were a bit out in our reckoning. Just
as Yargus was levering him over The
Snake gave a mighty wriggle and got
himself clear.
You should have heard them foreigners
yell!
The baboons were on their feet in a
second and into it again. In a grand
mix-up Yargus butted Th« Snake in the
pantry. The Snake dug his knee into
Yargus’s band-box. And all the time
they were cursing each other in some
foreign lingo that ain't in the dictionary.
“They can’t keep this pace up,” said
Sam when the war had been on for about
seven minutes. “Something will have to
happen directly.”
Something did happen. The pair were
scrambling in the middle of the ring.
Yargus made a grab for a head-hold and
missed. He overbalanced, and like a
flash The Snake went in and gave him
the flying mare.
1 wouldn’t have credited The Snake
with being so strong. Up in the air
went Yargus, and down he came like a
rocket stick. From where 1 was it looked
as if his shoulder hit the mat, but Sam
said he must have landed on his head.
He lay spread out on the canvas like a
dead man.
We dragged him to his corner and
worked on him with everything we had.
No good. We couldn’t make an eyelid
quiver. He was “out” a treat.
“The Snake wins, genelmen,” shouts
the ref. “Yargus can’t go on.”
Well, it was hard luck for Sam and
me ; but there was nothing to be gained
by squealing.
As soon as Yargus came round we
took him to his dressing-room. Sam
helped him into his clothes while I went
round and collected our end of the gate-
money. When I came back 1 gave them
each their chop and beat it for the city.
I’d enjoyed the wrestlin’ game immense.
About three weeks later I’m having
some scran in an eating-joint down near
the Quay when in bowls Big George
Dixon and squats himself down at my
table.
“Hiilloa, George,” I says. “I thought
you were away in the country.”
“I lobbed back here just about a week
ago,” says George, “and I’m pushin’ off
again next Monday. I’m takin’ a brace
of wrestlers on tour. Matchin’ ’em
agin one another. We’ll work our way
to Broken Hill, and then on to Adelaide
and Kalgoorlie, winding up at Perth.”
“Oh,” says I. “So you’ve come at
the wrestlin’ game, have you? What
sort of grapplers have you got?”
“A cuppler foreign blokes,” says
George. “Russians. They put up a go
that’ll take in all the mugs in captivity.”
“What do they call themselves?” 1
asks.
“One’s known as Yargus,” George
says, “and his sidekicker as The Snake.
Between you and me, they come from
the same town. A place called Sno—

“What, going?” George says, break-
ing off. “Well, I’ll see you again.”
VISITOR FROM CALLAN PARK.
BY CECIL MANN.
UNTIL the war their life had been, as
they were, twin. It was the coming
on of the war that changed that,
and the going on of it.
They enlisted together, and at once.
With a gang of 35 kanakas, they had
been cutting a twelve-feet-wide, two-
miles-long drain through a North Coast
swamp. Nominally, the contract stood
in Harry’s name, but the two, Harry and
John Grieve, worked it as a joint con-
cern, and would share in the profits, if
any.
It was not a noisome or pestiferous
swamp. There were mosquitoes, and
black snakes, and slender green ones;
but otherwise it was a good swamp,
packed with sword grass and tea-trees
and swamp-mahogany. Their tools were
short, thick, two-handled peat-saws,
which turned the peat out in deep, neat
blocks.
As Harry and John carried it on, it
was work in which kanaka labor was
peculiarly useful. They might go away
too often, those kanakas, and washa face
longa town, as their musical idiom de-
signated getting on a bender, but they
had no white man’s jealousy to provoke
indiscretion. So the Government inspec-
tor on his visit did not suspect that a
judiciously inserted few sheets of corru-
gated iron, downstream, and their equally
judicious removal shortly before he
started his inspection, accounted for the
fine running fall of the water. Nor did
he learn that this clever damming and
release was nicely judged to keep hidden
sundry stumps and logs that should have
been on the banks, along with the peat
hillocks.
After that inspection he allowed the
advance against contract applied for bv
Harry and the gang of kanakas found
themselves surprisingly paid off.
As Harry and John Tighe they enrolled
in the A.1.F., honoring and obeying the
King’s Regulations and learning to “put
a ‘sir’ on the end of it, damn you!”
Though in different units, “for safety’s
sake,” they enjoyed together the prosaic
scenery of Enoggera, the fine brown
Bulimba beer and such of Brisbane's
lovely ladies as condescended to the com-
mon soldiery.
In Mena they were together again.
They did not talk much. There was
understanding between them that made
talk unnecessary ; they knew each other
to the twitch of a nerve. John would be
waiting in his marquee in the artillery
lines certain that Harry would be over
with enough piastres to finance a run
into Cairo or an hour or two in the can-
teen. Or Harry would wait in his bell-
tent for John. There was a sixth sense
where they themselves were concerned.
They were as alike in thought as in
face.
The partnership divided again with
the move towards Gallipoli. At Lemnos
one day John sat out on the hatch of a
grimy troopship. The windmill on the
green hill clanked away, boats loaded
with sailors pulled about the blue waters,
and idle Diggers sniped at them with bis-
cuits as big as horseshoes, and harder.
From one boat that came alongside Harry
climbed up the rope ladder and clam-
bered over the greasy bulwark.
“Hullo,” John said. “Thought you
might drop over.”
Harry did not answer. He stood look-
ing towards a bank of clouds low over
the distant range. Save for them, the sky
had an Australian perfection.
He smoked a bent L. and Co. pipe,
silver clean at the join. He drew slowly
and thoughtfully at it for minutes.

“Y’ know,” he said then, “we’re mov-
ing to-morrow?”
“Hadn’t heard,” John said.
“Yes. I don’t like the feel of it much.
Can’t see myself getting through it.”
“Oh!” ,
“Well, I’ll be getting along.”
John stood up. Harry held out his
hand, and as they shook hands brown
eyes met brown eyes, held and dropped.
“Y* never can tell,” John said, as Harry
turned to go ; “but I’ll wait for my lot
till I get it.”
It was three weeks after The Landing
before John learned that Harry had
vanished in the dawn attack. No one in
the battalion knew any more than that,
but John was certain. “I suppose they
got him stepping into the water,” was
his finding.
For him the war went on. His gun was
blown up in June, and he went to Blighty.
Back then to Tel-el-Kebir, crown-and-
anchor, two-up, plenty of cucumbers and
tomatoes ; then over to France.
In October, 1917, he was in a pillbox
near the Menin Road when a 9.2 fell on
it. He was smashed, but he lived. They
picked specks of iron and grains of con-
crete out of him, grafted skin on to him,
fitted him up with a set of wooden
corsets, and so back to Australia.
They pensioned him, and turned him
loose in Sydney. “Turned him loose” is
perhaps an inaccurate way of putting it.
There was nothing wrong with John
Grieve, as he now once more called him-
self, or at least not much. He could
walk in the Anzac Day procession, and
invariably did. Afterwards there would
be Adams’s Bar, and some lunatic soup,
as the few fellows about who knew him
as Darkie called the brandy he drank.
There would be a round of bars after-
wards, “Just one and away,” and the eyes
of John Grieve would tend to roll a bit
more than they normally did, and there
would be hours of utter blank in his day,
when he would sit on a Hyde Park seat
or in the Press Club, staring straight
ahead.
The club indicates a minor miracle in
the life of John Grieve, drain-digger.
Between Gallipoli and home he dis-
covered a knack of putting other people’s
faces on paper. In the “Help the Digger”
period this knack won him a job, not
caricaturing, but in the commercial-art
line, with a roomy and well-lit office on
a fourth floor, not much to do, and
steady money. His wooden corsets he
kept to himself, so successfully that no-
body wasted any sympathy on him.
It was a nice quiet routine, with brandy
to keep his pecker up and morphia lo
put his nerves to sleep when they became
troublesome. But one day in that quiet
routine a thing happened that made him
wonder. *
He had been sitting at his draw-
ing-table, under the window, doing a
sketch of the sharp-cut, longish face of
a man who was seated in the other chair,
when he suddenly realised that the man
had gone. Coming to think of it, he
was not definitely sure about how the
man had come there or how he happened
to be drawing him.
He looked at the paper, sat sharply
up, then gazed at it. He had been draw-
ing himself.
He took the paper over to the large
mirror he used for catching poses in, and
compared it with the original. It was
an arresting likeness, except for the
youthfulness in the drawn head.
He did not laugh at himself. He
dropped it into the table drawer and
went out and had a brandy. Then lie
felt better. But after that his nerves
were not the occasional troublers they
had been. They became worse, and he
tried “snow.”
It was about a month later that a
much more amazing thing happened. He
had been staring out of his office win-
dow, when he turned to find a few feet
away from him a man whom he recog-
nised without the faintest hesitation as
Harry.
He stood up and stepped back as if
it was a picture he wanted to have a
look at.
“It’s all right,” Harry said. “It is me.
They let me out for to-day.”
“Who let you out?” he said.
“Callan Park,” said Harry. “A good
place. Better than this!”
“Johnno never got you at all?”
“Not on your sweet life! ” said Harry.
“Get that out of your head. Johnno didn’t
hurt me. Prison camp. Not too bad.
But not as good as Callan.”
“I thought Johnno got you all right.
He wasn’t taking many prisoners then,
was he?”
“Took me,” Harry said.
John Grieve accepted that. He walked
over to the window and looked down
on to the five o’clock rush beginning in
George-street.
“We might’s well go out and have a
quencher,” he said.
Harry did not answer. John turned
to find that he had gone.
John ran out of the door. The lift
was stationary at his floor. He went on
and looked down the stairs.
He felt fear. “Callan Park .... Callan
Park,” he muttered, going down the stairs
as fast as the wooden corsets would let
him.
He thought, “Anything might happen
to Harry. He mightn’t be quite all there.”
On the pavement he could see no sign
of his brother. He thought, “He would
walk. Not all right in the head.”
He started hastening along George-
street.
* * * *
It was a lovely day of sunshine.
There were many people moving about,
not in George-street, but at Callan Park.
“What a fine-looking fellow,” a woman
said.
“Yes,” said her guide. “His name is
Tighe. There’s nothing much wrong
with him,” he smiled patronisingly, “ex-
cept that he thinks we’re hiding his
brother from him.”
Queenslanders.
Rustling acres of mottled emeralds,
The sharp knife slashing the juicy cane,
The piled megass and the mill’s tall chimney,
The warming sunlight, the cooling rain;
Wheatfields blown into flying shadows,
Woolshcd, washpool and horn and hide,
Spade and shovel, and sluice and adit,
Far blue plains where the musterers ride;
Gold young moons of banana bunches,
Delicate squares of the barley green,
Pawpaw fragrant with ivory blossom,
Strawberry beds with their sweets between;
The chocolate fall of the fresh-ploughed
furrows,
Pineapples bristling in blades of grey,
The clinking cans in the misty morning,
The long hard hours of the farmer’s day.
They live their lives with a shred of leisure,
Lift haggard faces to brazen skies
In time of drought, and of bush-fires blackening
The precious feed on the grassy rise.
They have salted the earth with their dripping
sweat
When the axe went blunt on the hard-
grained wood;
They have fought the scrub and the burr and
cactus
Till they know that the thing which they
wrought is good.
They have battled with floods on the low-set
pastures.
Have ached in frost and grown brown in sun.
These are the heroes. Raise your glasses:
Give me the toast of every one !

Night.
’Tis night.
The fire is bright,
The stillness so profound
That not a sound
Comes to the waiting ear
From far or near.
Saving the sounding of the patient clock
That measures time with scrupulous “tick-tock,”
And the faint clicks
Of incandescent charcoal on the bricks.
When will he come?
To-night? To-morrow? Or next year?
In silence such as this, or in the hum
Of some unfriendly city, far from here?
Another sound.
Is’t he?
More like the far-off murmur of the sea,
Or night-wind whisp’ring to the trees around.
What tidings does it bring?
Whence comes the messenger on unseen wing?
From whom the message that may be
For me?....
Is’t he ?
The thin reek rises from the glowing root
That will be nothing, soon, but ash and soot.
But when my time will come ’twere vain to
ask;
Each has to finish his allotted task.

Red Cloak.
When quietude lay o’er the scene,
And leaden clouds hung low,
I glimpsed a red cloak through the grey
Of dead trees long ago.
As down a vista, dim and far,
That vision flashed on me,
I sensed it was no parrot’s breast
That flamed so ruddily.
Though late the hour, though lone the hour,
With hoof-strokes on the air
And no sound else, full well I knew
Red Cloak was riding there.
To me it seemed in that still scene,
Beneath that lightless sky,
The sapless trees grew green again
To watch Red Cloak go by.
As she rode on no bird made song
Anigh or far apart,
Yet all the birds of all the land
Were singing in my heart.
No leaf I saw, red-hued or green,
No blossom met my sight,
Yet in my heart bloomed all the flowers
That blow for man’s delight.
No petalled censer scent distilled,
No odor rose to greet
The falling dew, and yet my heart
Was charged with perfume sweet.
Though now no more nigh Milbrulong
Alone at day’s dim close —
Far Milbrulong, old Milbrulong—
Red Cloak a-riding goes,
There still —a flash, a flame, a flower —
. I glimpse her as she sped
Through grey of twilight and the grey
Of sapless trees and dead. - •/

Are you one of the thousands of men and
women who either through their class of
occupation or some physical disability are
compelled to lead a more or less seden-
tary life ?
If so, you will no doubt find such a
method of living prevents sufficient exer-
cise being obtained and a constipated con-
dition naturally exists. In cases of that
type something is needed to assist nature.
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are excellent for this
purpose. You will find them used and praised far
and wide. They stir the Liver, cleanse the Stomach,
and stimulate the Bowels, thus opening and toning the
clogged-up system and making it better able to combat
Life’s Little Daily Ills.

Worms
A Common Complaint with Children
How to Treat It
Worms, by their movements and the
interruption they offer to the contents
of the Bowels, generally occasion pain
or uneasiness in the Abdomen, some-
times spasmodic, sometimes gnawing
and biting, and not infrequently of a
vague, indescribable character, and yet
very distressing. Sympathetic with this
is a sensation of itching at the nostrils,
producing a disposition to pick the Nose,
which is characteristic of the affection.
The Bowels are often disordered, some-
times relaxed, as in Dysentery. The
appetite is exceedingly variable ; in some
cases natural; in others deficient, craving
or depraved, one condition not infre-
quently alternating with another. The
Abdomen is often hard, swollen and tym-
panetic, the breath heavy or foetid, and
tongue furred, with disagreeable taste, and
a copious flow of saliva; swelling of the
upper lip, bleeding of the nostrils and
disposition to grind the teeth during the
sleep are other characteristic symptoms.
The effects, however, often extend be-
yond the Alimentary Canal, and various
derangements of health are experienced
in consequence, either of the direct irri-
tation of the worms or of the disordered
digestion which ihey occasion. Among
the most common of these are nervous
affections such as fretfulness, irritation of
temper, wakefulness or disposition to Ex-
cessive sleep, disturbed sleep, sud4en
starting out of sleep, as if from fright,
dizziness, spasmodic movement of the
eyelids, temporary blindness and deafness.
Unfortunately, many mothers fail to
recognise the fact that their little ones
have worms, are suffering intense pain
and distress, and are practically irrespon-
sible for the outbursts of temper, restless-
ness and peevishness, and until some more
serious symptoms appear nothing is done
to alleviate the distress. The symptoms of
this disease are somewhat variable, but
generally they are so characteristic that
no mother need have any doubts. The
best proof of worms is worms, and if
the general conduct of the child is such
as to give the slightest suspicion a care-
ful watch will afford ample proof.
A child who is affected with Thread
Worms will often appear to the eye to be
in an indifferent state of health. It
becomes peevish and irritable in its
temper. Another point to which the
attention of mothers should be specially
directed is that the child is apt to start
in its sleep, its repose being in the way of
a disturbed nature.
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets
are a purely vegetable medicinal pre-
paration, compounded on a scientific
principle for the eradication of worms
which infest the Intestines. They contain
specific properties which destroy the
worms but cause no injury to the
Stomach or Bowels, and do not weaken
the system. The pellets are prepared in
the form of a confection or lolly, have no
disagreeable taste or smell, but, on the
contrary, inspire children to take them
as they would an ordinary sweet.
Obtainable at all Chemists and Stores,

Ltd., 23 Lang Street, Church Hill,
Sydney. Price 4/- per packet (6 packets
