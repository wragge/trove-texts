New Gods for Old
In a recent article Mr. Norman Lindsay,
of whom I claim to be a humble admirer,
tells us that “only a Shakspeare has a right
to criticise Shakspeare.” As I am not a
Shakspeare, but just an average person, I
am practically forbidden (by Mr. Lindsay,
not by Shakspeare) to read the plays and
poems of the world’s greatest poet unless I
am prepared to abrogate my critical judg-
ment, shut my eyes, open my mouth and
swallow whatever the bard cares to ram
down my throat. As this is distasteful,
not to say humiliating, I sincerely hope
Mr. Lindsay is mistaken, and venture to
advance some reasons for believing that he is.
To say that I have no right to criticise
Shakspeare because I am not a Shakspeare
is very much like saying that I have no
right to criticise my dinner because I am
not a cook. Critical judgment and poetic
genius are two quite different things. The
one may exist without the other. Many great
critics have been incapable of writing poetry,
while many great poets have proved them-
selves very incompetent critics. It would
be far less unreasonable to deny to the aver-
age man the right to criticise Sir Isaac
Newton. For Newton was a mathematician,
and the science of mathematics is highly tech-
nical and specialised. But poetry is meant
for the people, not for a special few. Shaks-
peare wrote for the theatre, and its doors
were flung open to the vulgar. Far from
denying the right of judgment to any, he
challenged the judgment of all. And what,
after all, is judgment but criticism? To
say that the average reader has no right to
criticise Shakspeare is really tantamount to
saying that he has no right to read Shaks-
peare. For it is impossible to read Shaks-
peare without criticising him. As a sane
man reads, his admiration rises and falls
with the quality of the work. When the
sane reader comes on certain passages—and,
as Johnson pointed out long ago, the works
of Shakspeare are full of them —he must, in
spite of himself, class them as blemishes. In
other words, he must criticise Shakspeare—
the very thing Mr. Lindsay tells him he has
no right to do.
Mr. Lindsay’s aphorism is based on the
common assumption that there is an un-
bridgeable difference between the great man
and the man of average intelligence. That
assumption is unfounded. Greatness is rela-
tive. If we were all Shakspeares Shaks-
peare would be nobody in particular. AVe
call a man great, not because he is immeas-
urably above all men, but because he is
iu some things just sufficiently above them
to be classed apart. But no sooner does he
earn the distinction than the popular imagi-
nation proceeds to clothe him with super-
natural attributes and to transform him into
a sort of deity. But he is only mortal for
all that. As Heine said, the greatest of
men make the meanest of gods. Voltaire
uttered a profound truth when he said that
no man is a hero to his valet. It is notori-
ous that no man is great to his wife. And
I venture to add that no man is great to
himself. Really great men do not take
their greatness too seriously. I should say
that Sir Isaac Newton had as good a title
to greatness as most men. Yet it was New-
ton who said : “I feel that I am but a child
gathei-ing shells by the seashore while the
great ocean of Truth lies unexplored before
me.” After all is said, there is not a very
great difference between the mind that wrote
Hamlet and the mind that understands it
and enjoys it.
It might even be contended that the differ-
ence between Shakspeare and the aver-
age man is not so much a difference
in power of thought and emotion as a
difference in power of expression. I do not
go so far as to hold with Bernard Shaw
that Shakspeare lacked the power of origi-
nal thought. But I have no hesitation in
saying that his supreme gift is the gift of
expression. This gift is so marvellous that
it enables him to make the most common
platitudes sound as if they were the last
word in wisdom. If any politician dared to
tell a public audience that the man who is
true to himself could not be false to others,
he would run the risk of being hissed off the
platform. But when Shakspeare utters the
same platitude in these rolling lines,
To thine own self be true,
And it must fol'ow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man,
it sounds like the wisdom of the gods. If,
as I contend, poets are loved, not for the
depth and originality of their thought or
emotion, but for their gift of expressing
with supreme power and beauty the thoughts
and emotions of all of us, it follows that
we may without presumption, even in the
case of the greatest of them, pass judgment
on their work—say how far they have failed
or succeeded in putting our thoughts, our
emotion, ourselves, into their songs.
The gift of expression is a rare and pre-
cious one, and far be it from me to under-rate
it. But it is none the less true that many
fine minds do not possess it. Many a man
has a fine sense of color and beauty, although
he lacks the power of manipulation neces-
sary to paint a picture, just as many a man
has the manipulative power of painting
pictures whose sense of beauty is by no
means of the highest. Similarly, many a
man who could not write a poem to save
himself from the gallows is to an abnormal
degree responsive to the poetry of others,
just as many men incapable of singing or
playing on an instrument are keenly respon-
sive to good music. It is no mere paradox
to say that some of the world’s greatest
poets have never written a poem, and some
of its greatest painters never painted a pic-
ture. To deny to such men the right to
criticise poetry or painting is, as I said at
the beginning, suspiciously like denying to
a man with a fine palate the right to pro-
nounce judgment on a dinner on the ground
that he could not cook one.
For the rest, let me say that, while it is
wise and good to honor and esteem great
artists, it is ignorant folly for us to prostrate
ourselves before them. If their achieve-
ments have a lesson for us at all, that lesson
is to scorn convention, to cultivate candor
and courage, to dare to be ourselves, and
to refuse, even at the bidding of the great-
est, to connive at an intellectual subjection
which would end in intellectual death. If
the claims put forward by Mr. Lindsay
could be sustained, if men and women could
be threatened or cajoled into adopting to-
wards the works of Shakspeare an attitude
of uncritical adulation, it would become a
sacred duty to hurl Shakspeare from his
place of eminence and blot out from our
memories every line of his works, lor it
would be a million times better that Sliaks-
peare should be forgotten than that reason
and the rights of reason should perish from
the earth.
WALLACE NELSON.
Judge Beeby, Dramatist
The most interesting volume of plays pub-
lished in Australia is by the N. S. A\ ales
Judge Beeby. That, without doubt or ques-
tion, must be the first note in any honest
criticism of Concerning Ordinary People,
just issued by Gordon and Gotch (Sydney).
The six plays show great variety of theme
and considerable diversity of treatment, but
in every case the author has something real
to say, and says it. His people are alive, and
talk reasonably; the speeches follow one an-
other naturally; and most of the dialogue
possesses the great essential of drama in-
evitablity. The fiction-writer, with due ex-
planations as to how the eyebrows were
lifted or the fingers twitched, can give a
passing semblance of reality to a dialogue
which, if made to stand alone, would be
most unconvincing. In the drama the in-
evitable words must be used, or the false
note is instantly detected. In fiction, with
an elaborate background of descriptive color,
the characters may talk on and say nothing,
the author himself sparring for- wind, as it
were; in the drama the talk must all be to
the point, the point being the development of
the story in the elaboration of the speaker s
character. Hardly ever in the course of
these six plays does any speaker introduce
a word or phrase which is not entirely in
keeping with character and dramatic develop-
ment. There are no villains and no heroes.
Nobody murders anybody; nobody indulges
in emotional hysteria; there is neither vio-
lence nor treachery shown by any leading
character; yet there is not a page of mere
commonplace in the book. All the effects
are got honestly, and most of them very
quietly.
Viewed as to the possibility of their public
representation on the stage, these plays are
good. Given the right actors and the right
audience, there is not one which might not
have a reasonable hope of success; and at
least two should have a very fair chance of
being enthusiastically received by Australian
theatregoers. In some there is rather too
much talk and too little action; but none
are as bad in this respect as plays by Shaw
which have had a- strong popular appeal.
The talk never goes on for the mere sake
of getting off a few clever things; the cur-
tain falls at the right places; and if there
are few intense- situations, there are many
moderately interesting ones.
“The Banner,” with which the book opens,
is a lightweight comedy with an atmosphere
which will pass for Australian. The central
figures are a young girl who has taken over
the management of a country newspaper
office from a drunken father, and a young
jackeroo from England who whites her
leaders. The rest of the people are
types rather than characters, a trifle
burlesqued. - “The Point of View” deals
strongly and sympathetically with a
strike in the boot trade. It is a sub-
ject about which Judge Beeby knows
much ; and both employers and strikers have
a good deal to learn from it. “Dregs” tells
of the war, the senders of white feathers and
the profiteers in army requirements. “One
Touch of Nature” is a sketch of coalminers
and the triangular struggle of sport, union-
ism and religion. The parson rushing out
to watch the dog-fight and assuring the miners
that he has better fighting dogs at home is un-
usual, but convincing enough in the setting.
“Potter and Clay” is a quiet little picture
of a lady and a professor. It is brightly
enough handled, but is the slightest thing
in the book. “Still Waters,” a rollicking
comedy-farce, goes delightfully from start to
finish. It concerns itself with the adven-
tures of a staid, elderly lawyer who resolves
to write a play. His secret murmurings
and constant hiding of papers move his
family to an overwhelming regard for his
health. On the suggestion of his doctor, he
takes a trip to America, where, in a single
week, he has an amazing round of adven-
tures. “Still Waters,” well acted, might
easily fill an evening with joyous laughter.
Nothing in this book touches heights of
greatness; nothing falls to mediocrity; the
whole grips and holds the attention. Judge
Beeby should have it in him to do much
finer things; the foundations are right. Sin-
cerity and honesty are the keynotes of his
work; and there is enough humor to keep
the rest seasoned. Though some of the
matter is not distinctively Australian, the
book is a very creditable addition to the Aus-
tralian shelf; and on the mere ground of
the general interest in the stories told, most
readers would be glad of a second helping.

A Christian in the Wilderness
Plato’s ambition to rebuild society on prin-
ciples of pure justice was never more widely
cherished than it is to-day. Thinking people
look around them and are dejected. In
sober, constitutional England they see un-
employment, with emigration advised as a
cure —a device which can only mean, in
many cases, that the derelict will starve
abroad instead of performing the ungraceful
act at home. In revolutionary Russia, under
a professedly benevolent dictatorship, things
are no better. The only real difference is
that there the industrialists are starving
rather than the agricultural workers. Mem-
bers of the proletariat are still in chains
except where they have been able to annex
productive land, formerly the property of
their overlords, and become capitalists. In
most eases, according to reliable witnesses,
tlicir Bolshevism or Brotherhood Spirit has

is the ideal soap
Jvr your haby>>
Y°V can’t—no mother can—
afford to experiment with baby’s
welfare. About his diet, his clothing,
his toilet, every mother must be sure
that her choice is the result of wisdom
based on knowledge. Haphazard
methods are not good enough for
the most precious thing in the world
-—a little new baby.
The choice of soap for baby’s use
is a most important matter. The
wrong kind will so quickly irritate
and dry the skin; so harmfully clog
the delicate tiny pores and check
their natural adion; so rapidly
coarsen the texture of a skin natur-
ally smooth and creamy as a pearl.
None but the mildest, purest and
most soothing soap is good enough
for baby’s skin. How are you to
make sure of getting this kind of
soap for your baby ? There is only
one way. You must know its
ingredients, These must determine
your choice.
The oils of the palm and the olive
are the mildest, purest and most
soothing cleansers known. The
highly cultivated people of ancient
Egypt knew of and benefited by the
unique properties of these valuable
oils. Modern science has failed to
discover anything to surpass their
beneficial effeds.
Palmolive Soap contains palm and
olive oils. Certainly Palmolive is the
ideal soap for your baby. Every
morning, every night, work up a soft
velvety lather with Palmolive and
warm water. Massage it lightly into
the skin. Be sure to wash the little
head with Palmolive. This will serve
to proted your baby from cradle-cap
and other ailments of the scalp.
Use Palmolive always and be sure.

YPrisfocr-afic Pioneers
[harWswines of tintara,
faded out with the acquisition of wealth:
they deny the artisans in the towns a
share in their prosperity, and are alleged
to spit and cross themselves three times at
the mention of industrialism. A. J. Penty,
author of Towards a Christian Sociology
(Allen and Unwin), has been deploring
these tendencies for years, and he now advo-
cates a social system based on the teachings
of the Saviour.
In “Guilds and the Social Crisis’ and
again in “A Guildman's Interpretation of
History,” he set out liis theory that modern
industrialism is rotten at the base. It rests,
he says, on the pagan principles of Roman
Law, which were designed to enable rich
men to live safely among poor (in plain
words, for the protection of property), and
not, as should be the case, to enable good
men to live among- bad. Lawyers will dis-
pute his contention that the Common Law
of England derives direct from Justinian;
but that our general attitude is identical
with that of the materialistic Roman is
shown in the heavy sentences inflicted for
minor crimes against property proportion-
ately to those imposed for minor offences
against the person. Penty does not enjoin
a rigid application of Christian principles
to everyday life. How could a business con-
tinue, for example, if its head carried out
the Saviour’s direction: “Give to him that
asketh thee, and from him that would bor-
row of thee turn not thou away”? He does
not even suggest such logical attempts to
come close to Christianity as were made in
mediaeval times. The doles of the monas-
teries in the 15th century, inspired by the
text just quoted, no doubt did as much econo-
mic damage to England; relatively to popu-
lation, as the State doles are now doing.
What he advocates is a form of Christianity
for profit—combinations of citizens on voca-
tional lines, each trade or industry being
concerned to punish sweating as sternly as
profiteering, with employer and employees
combining to maintain the moral repute of
their craft. Some of medimval guilds
made a success of this ideal right up to the
time of the Chantries Act; and notably
most of the building guilds. It was an age
of faith and illiteracy. The workers em-
ployed on the construction of, say, a Salis-
bury Cathedral had the social prestige and
spiritual comfort attached to the perform-
ance of a holy task; political agitators
were not allowed within the city walls, and
there was no Labor press to tell the humbler,
toilers that they were being exploited. In
any event, the prophet of revolution would
have had a hard time. England was then
producing far more food than its three mil-
lion inhabitants required, and the workers,
in addition to being well fed, were reason-
ably well clothed. All the members of even
the largest guilds had the opportunity to do
work gratifying to an artist’s pride; there
was no one in all England whose sole job
consisted in attending to one mechanical pro-
cess from one year’s end to the next. And,
above all, the community’s life was uncom-
plicated by the innumerable superfluities—
the cinema, pony-racing, travel, two-up, the
telephone, vaudeville shows, cricket and
football matches —which have become neces-
sities to the average modern worker. It was
as easy and natural for the architects, build-
ers and operatives of a section of Wiltshire
to combine, at the behest of some bishop or
abbot, on an ecclesiastical enterprise likely
to employ them for the rest of their lives,
as it is in our time for a bush family to co-
operate in a farming venture; and if any
dereliction led to one of the corporation
being excluded he felt the disgrace as a
modern business man might feel being turned
out of his club.
Do such conditions exist to any extent
worth mentioning to-day, and if not is .it
possible to recreate them? Penty admits
their absence by proposing Trade Parlia-
ments :
If any standards of honesty and fair dealing are
to be upheld, prices and wages, fixed on a basis of
justice, machinery and other things necessary to the
proper conduct of industry to be regulated, the final
authority must be vested in the trade as a whole,
for onlv those who suffer from the growth of abuses
can be' relied upon to take measures to support them.
But the mediaeval guild functioned success-
fully for the reason chiefly that.it was thor-
oughly undemocratic. Its policies were dic-
tated by an authoritarian of the Mussolini
stamp—one who knew what he wanted and
brooked no argument on the point. The Par-
liamentary system has developed of late
years into an elaborate piece of machinery
designed to get things done as slowly as pos-
sible —so much so that during the war Par-
liaments were suspended—and a great busi-
ness is in much the same position as a
nation at war.
The arid truth about the plight into which
civilisation has got itself is that palliatives
are hopeless, and more particularly pallia-
tives based on religion. The situation of the
industrialised world is that of a profiteer
who has complicated his previously equable
existence with two or three large houses, a
yacht, a fleet of motor-cars and a score of
new business interests. His family and
friends may urge him to consider his per-
sonal well-being in this world and the next
by playing and praying more, but he is in
the grip of a fever which progressively leaves
him less and less time for such things. His
life can be simplified only by financial ruin
or the approach of death. Society lacks the
will to be Christlike —a vital factor which
is not taken into consideration by Christian
sociologists such as Penty,
J. B. D.
Utopias
Tho 19tli century, given over to idealistic
speculation and dominated by a priori rea-
soning and abstract theory, was a time most
favorable to the production of fancied
Utopias and projected millenniums. The
most fertile period was that from 1860 to
1890, during which years appeared Butler’s
“Erewhon,” Bellamy’s “Looking Backward.”
Morris’s “News from Nowhere,” George’s
“Progress and Poverty” and Lytton’s “Com-
ing Race,” all of which belong in essentials
to the same genus. Prior to these had
appeared Cabet’s “Voyage en Icarie” (1839)
and Fourier’s “Theory of Universal Har-
mony” (1822). The manufacture of mil-
lenniums was, in fact, a fascinating and not
unprofitable literary pastime in that heroic
age. Verification of the subject matter by the
test of facts being considered of minor import-
ance, the imagination of the author could
have more scope than in the writing even
of fiction. As his inventive faculty was
usually capacious, the results achieved on
paper—seem sufficiently generous to a taw-
dry age in which the mere picture of addi-
tional cakes and ale is described as Ijtopian
—-and sometimes is—and in which whatever
millennial plans one may have one reserves
for private consumption for fear of being
deemed mentally unbalanced.
The extravagant optimism of these and
other last-century world-planners was no
bar to their obtaining an enormous vogue, by
no means confined to the ignorant classes.
About 200 more or less Utopian experiments
are recorded in the United States alone, most
of them in the last century. The most con-
siderable were the various Owenite communi-
ties, “New Harmony” and others ; “Icaria, ’
founded on the ideas of Cabet; the "Pha-
lanxes,” on those of Fourier. Most of them
were rank failures and all of them dis-
appointments. Fourier had perhaps the
greatest vogue among literary circles. Some
of his anticipations were that after his plan
had been going for a season wonderful things
would happen—almost the wild animals
would tame themselves for man’s delectation,
an all-round-the-year Spring climate set in,
and the kindly ocean turn into lemonade for
man’s refreshment! Yet people of the calibre
of Emerson, Henry James, Lowell, Greeley
and Charles A. Dana were ardent
Fourierians in their day, though possibly
unaware of these anticipations. An attrac-
tive, untried theory is apt to hypnotise some
of the brightest of minds, as Australia dis-
covered in the days when William Lane
preached his Paraguayan paradise. It is
man’s way, in sociology, to learn some of
his simplest lessons by stumbling, and the
vicissitudes of New Harmony, Icaria, the
Phalanxes, New Australia, and all the rest
had not then become history.
Though their literary merit is usually not
great, some of these millennial anticipations
repay perusal, if only as souvenirs of human
credulity and as illustrative of the truth
that theory is the alcohol of the brain, stimu-
lating to a point, but, past that, addling. The
millennial cake has been made in many
shapes and with multifarious ingredients
from Plato to Wells without ever becoming-
digestible to mankind. There is room for
the exercise of the nicest taste and infinite
ingenuity in the choosing of just that com-
bination that will prove ideal. Those who
tackled the job in the 19th century did their
best to exhaust the possibilities of the sub-
ject, and there is, throughout, a creditable
comprehensiveness in the provisions made
by them for the satisfaction of every crav-
ing of the human heart and the elimination
of every shade 'of inconvenience. One omis-
sion, however, common to them all, mars
their complete symmetry. Death is, strange
to say, not included in the list of pro-
scriptions. I have always been disposed to
regard this exceedingly well-established in-
stitution as a prime nuisance and was dis-
appointed to find it not set down for abo-
lition along with such minor evils as work,
disease, discontent, jealousy, anger and the
other 77 deadly sins. Beside the bier of his
loved one man deems the resistless Reaper
his worst foe. Certain it is that as long
as he takes his regular toll, so long must
Life remain a symphony phrased in its most
compelling moments in the minor key. Death,
in fact, has obviously far less right to exist
in a well-bred millennium than in our
present society, where it is sometimes a
friend.
A provision for earthly immortality is
therefore necessary to make the most attrac-
tive millennium ever devised a symmetrical
whole. But, like quite a number of things
in this perverse world, such an addition
would have had its consequences. If there
were no deaths and offspring continued to
arrive as usual, it is obvious that, in a
trifling .space of time—say 10,000 years-
the earth would become so crowded and the
question of space such a pertinent one as
to be incompatible with approved millennial
sentiments, which would eventually be sus-
pended to allow of some space being cleared.
A possible preventive of such a crisis would
be the artificial abolition of childbirth alto-
gether, an achievement probably not beyond
the legislative attainments of the communis-
tic mind, which in Oneida, it is recorded,
was able to establish polyandry and poly-
gamy simultaneously, the children, after
weaning, being reared socially with no
special reference to the parents, whose in-
fluence might have been corrupting. How-
ever, it is possible that the absence of any
offspring might rob life of considerable in-
terest ; but, as the whole population would
speedily be aged a thousand years and up-
wards, perhaps it wouldn’t matter so much.
It is one of those questions on which almost
any expression of opinion is premature.
On the whole, the mind finds it hard to re-
sist the conclusion that, though we cannot
have a millennium while Death persists, it
is almost as difficult to have one with Death
absent. Obviously our Ancient Enemy is
not without good points.

A Satchel of Books
Chats on Old English Drawings, by Randall Davies,
F.S.A. (Unwin). Another in the admirable series
of handbooks for collectors, written by a man with
a full knowledge of the things whereof he sneaks.
These are the days of much buying and selling and
faking in the art world; but, having listened to
what Davies has to say, if a man makes a bad
bargain the sin will surely be on his own head.
The Red Redmaynes, by Eden Philpotts (Hutchin-
son). Philpotts’s degeneration as a writer began
when he started a new life as a detective fictionist
with the mystery of “The Grey Room.” The pre-
sent tale is equally far-fetched, and one tends to
weary of the author’s efforts to maintain the pre-
posterous false identity of the leading miscreant,
whilst presenting his wife as a genius in deception
who manages to bluff a ’tec from Scotland Yard.
Sydney Cove, by J. H. M. Abbott (Angus and
Robertson). Into this story of the misfortunes of
Mary Mortimer, a prisoner by the Lady Penrhvn,
and her love for Lieut. Patrick Cartwright, Mr.
Abbott has poured all the rich color he has drawn
from his study of the times of Governor Phillip.
No other man has equipped himself as Mr. Abbott
has done for the writing of these romances of early
Australia; and this time he has a good story as well
as good setting for it.
Ilarilek, by “Ganpat” (Blackwood). This is a
really daring romance of Central Asia. “Harilek”
(Harry Lake) and two companions of the Great
War ‘went looking for a mysterious country to
which the grandfather of one of them had left some
clues; and “Ganpat” merely edits the diary of one
of them, confessing in an introduction that he doesn’t
know how it got out of the far, mysterious country,
or whether it is fiction or fact. It is an ingenious
invention, not wholly incredible, and the reader who
is looking- for adventure and a happy ending reaps
a 30-bu.shel harvest.
The Windmill (Heinemann). Stories, essays,
poems and drawings by about 50 writers and artists
who have had work published by this house. They
make a goodly company—Swinburne, Lafcadio Hearn,
Gosse, Galsworthy, Masefield, Beerbohm, Zangwill,
Crane, Symons, Lovat Fraser, Rackham and Aldin
among- them. And as a makeweight to a generous
book, the profits from which go to the Royal Liter-
ary Fund, there are facsimile reproductions of the
MS'S, of men like Sterne, Stevenson, Swinburne, Con-
rad and Henry James.
Vindication, by Stephen McKenna (Hutchinson).
Experienced readers of Stephen McKenna know what
to expect, and in this latest effort they are not
disappointed. There is the usual fashionable amour
between the quivery young matron and the wistful
philanderer, who is disgusted to find his own wife
indifferent to Titian and Velasquez, followed by the
inevitable determination of everybody concerned to
remember their breeding and behave properly when
the scandal leaks out. Those who tire of the narra-
tive can get quite a literary education from the
quotations at the beginning of each chapter. Shaks-
peare, Bacon, Montaigne, Browning, Maeterlinck,
Oscar Wilde and Omar Khayyam have all been
drawn upon by the erudite author.
Among the Blackie and Son publications in time
for the Christmas trade are some altogether charm-
ing! little volumes in the “Red Letter Poet” series
and “The Wallet Library of English Prose,” and a
big list of stories for youths and maidens—the former
including The Great White Chief, a rattling- New
Guinea yarn by Robert M. Macdonald; The Lost
Explorers, by Alexander Macdonald ; The Bushrangers’
Secret, an exciting tale set in S. Aus. by Mrs. Henry
Clarke; and stories by such girls’ favorites as May
Wynne, Evelyn Smith, Bessie Marchant and Sheila
E. Braine. There is also a fine crop for younger
folk, headed by “Blackie’s Children’s Annual,” “Girls’
Annual,” “Little Ones’ Annual” and ranging down
in size and price to a threepenny Beauty and the
Beast.
Old English Sporting Prints and their History, by
Ralph • Nevill (The Studio). A sumptuous volume
with over 200 reproductions—about 50 in color—
of prints dealing with racing, hunting, coaching,
etc., dating from the 17th century onward. The
horse, of course, figures most prominently in them,
and a weird sort of animal he often is, galloping in
the attitude of a rocking-horse with his belly almost
on the ground. There is no great artistic genius
behind these pictures, but their value in the eye of
the collector is great, and most of them are of par-
ticular interest to the English sportsman because of
famous incidents they memorialise. Nevill’s intro-
ductory letterpress passes in review practically all
the men of note whose talents leant towards this
peculiarly English phase of “art.”
The End of the House of Alard, by Sheila Kaye-
Smith (Cassell). This is a Hogarthian essay in
pride. Sir John Alard is a turbulent squire whose
tyranny is only exceeded by his hatred for anything
he believes will contaminate his family name. His
eldest son, Hugh, is killed in the war, so Peter,
the second son, becomes heir. In order that the
estarte may acquire sufficient money for its upkeep,
he sacrifices the woman he loves and marries a rich
Jewess, committing suicide when he has a daughter
born to him instead of a son. On the evening that
Peter dies Sir John also gives up the ghost, his
end being hastened by his youngest son, Gervasse,
becoming a motor-engineer. Another son, George, is
a weak-spirited parson, and makes a sudden exit.
But the bitterest pill for the old man to swallow is
when Jenny marries Ben Godfrey, a neighboring
farmer. He is a fine man, with a large estate, but
(l-emarks Peter contemptuously) his ancestors were
serfs, and ran at the stirrups of the Alards.
The Romance of Excavation, by David Masters
(John Lane). The dead hand of Tutankhamen is
still turning the printing press; and of the flood of
resulting books few have been more ..interesting
than this. The author does not stop at Egypt, but
has intriguing stories to tell of the risks, heart-
breaks and successes of the men who set out to
unearth the pa»t in the dust of Assyria, Troy ami
Crete. The title is apt, for here is romance indeed
laden down with adventure, tragedy ami treasure;
and when you are through with it you are inclined
to share the amazement of the old Arab who said
to Layard when he disclosed the buried civilisation
of Assyria: “My father and the father of my father
pitched their tents here before me: but they never
heard of this. For 1200 years have the true
believers been settled in this country, and none of
them heard of a palace underground. 'But lo !
here comes a Frank from many days’ journey oft
and he walks up to the very place and he takes a
stick and makes a line here and makes a line
there. ‘Here,’ says he, ‘is the palace ; there,’ says he,
‘is the gate’ ; and he shows us what has been all our
lives beneath our feet....ls it ,by magic? Speak,
O Bey! Tell us the secret of wisdom!’’
Memoirs of the Hon. Sir Robert Philp, 1851-1922,
bv Harry C. Perry (Watson, Ferguson, Brisbane).
“My desire,” the author says, “was that Sir Robert
should tell the whole story in his own words. As
it developed, however, it became clear that his in-
nate modesty was leading to the compilation of a
history in which his own personality was being con-
stantly submerged.” So “a good portion of the
story has had to be told in the third person.” It
was a mistake to attempt to make it both a bio-
graphy and an autobiography. The plan has cramped
the author’s style, and the result is not particularly
attractive. There is a vast amount of data; but
the book would have made pleasanter reading had
the ample materials been worked up into the story
which almost cried aloud for the writing. For, be-
sides being a frequent Premier in the State where
politics have been more picturesque than anywhere
else in Australia, Robert Philp was associated with
the beginnings of Burns, Philp and Co. and the
A.U.S.N. ; he was early on the Palmer and other
northern goldfields ; he was connected with the sugar
business from its birth in Queensland; and the
pastoral business both ruined him and in his last
years made a rich man of him. Mr. Perry follows
him conscientiously through his varied and active
career, dwelling longest on his political adventures,
and, as his subject would certainly have had him
do, stating the case as between him and his oppo-
nents alwavs with fairness.

Shirley Falcke on Sincerity in Art:—
We do not need New Styles in Art. The continual
cry for originality only brings forth monstrosities
of the futurist and cubist cults. Let ours be more a
cry for perfection of technique. A man who has the
gift will take up any style, and work in it, making
it fresh and virile, as if every thought were new.
As a fact, evolution is always going on, even when
artists believe that they are slavishly imitating their
predecessors. A thorough study of the work of Old
Masters is essential—such men as the Van Eycks,
who conceived the best medium of oil-color painting ;
Michel Angelo, the supreme master of Italian Art;
Albert Durer, the greatest of Early Renaissance Ger-
man painters; Holbein, Rembrandt, Leonardo da
Vinci, Donatello, Cellini, Verrocchio, Bernini and
Fra Filippo Lippi, to mention only a few. Past
masters of all the arts have been influenced by earlier
masters. Raphael was influenced by Perugino.
Gounod and even Beethoven have both used themes
of Bach. An artist intent on expressing an idea on
canvas, for others to appreciate, will not choose a
confused, distorted mass of material, as do the ultra-
moderns ; and their so-called individuality is no
excuse for faulty drawing and crude coloring. What
we need is more sincerity of purpose; the desire
should be to eliminate the distracting elements and
strive after simplicity. Let the work be character-
istic of the artist. True Art is the expression of
a feeling, of an emotion, which the artist has experi-
enced. Might I suggest that the Sydney National
Art Gallery should reserve one room for the w'orks of
Old Masters? Australia will never regret it.

Sonnet.
Love is no sheltered happiness to me;
In solitude I struggled on through vast
White, silent, haunted places in the past,
Before you came. I felt your love to be
My being’s vindication. Eagerly
I threw my mystic world aside to cast
Myself, thought-weary, in your arms at last,
Because your eyes looked understandingly.
The great, white places are as lonely still;
And still I am a speck ’twixt earth and star.
The same blind torments shake me on their
foam;
But now there is one more. From every hill
Love bids me turn to see a gleam afar—
The firelight, love-light, candlelight of home.

Red Poppies.
Red poppies flaring on their stems of jade,
Frail cups of flame above the sun-crowned
height,
Great crimson censers swaying in the light--
Why must the wonder of such beauty fade?
The* petals tremble, rifled and dismayed,
Like sullen spots upon the breast of night;
Torn by the winds perchance in wilful flight
Ere the bright pageant of the day is played.
There is a mystery in such flowers, it seems,
Whose wings are veined with vivid, leaping
fire;
Warm petals on the wanton breezes shed
Let loose a thousand visions of desire.
Their breath is heavy with the dust of dreams
Blown from the endless echoes of the dead.

The First Rose.
Who weeps for pity of the lovely rose
That lingers lonely when the flowers have
fled
The empty garden when the west wind blows,
And silken petals drifting fall like snows—
Sad tears for summer’s passing softly
shed—
While grim and grey the winter clouds hang
low?
Grieve rather for the solitary flower
That early blooms alone and lonely goes,
Whose beauty, passing ere the glorious hour
Of golden summer’s joyous coming, dies
Too soon —the first forgotten, fallen rose —
Beneath a wintry sun and careless skies.

Life Is So Dear.
Life is so dear! Yet not for my own sake,
Rut yours who sleep beside me while I wake.
It is a joy I cannot satisfy
To watch you sleep with parted lips that sigh
Upon my name, in spaces ’twist the stars,
Where dreams have keys for every latch that
bars
The gates of daytime Edens that in vain
We have so often sought and seek again.
Night is so precious, dear —precious and
strange,
Filled with world-chaos and the sounds
of change.
Outside the jasmine strains against the wind
And flutters on the casement, petal-thinned.
There is no wonder but your sleeping face;
It leaves my soul forgotten for a space.
As though the pallid ghost of your heart
said :
“O woman that I loved, you are long dead
And have no more of love or joy to bring
To me who have forgotten everything.”
But, even as I weep, you turn to me
Blind even as our love or fear can be,
And, in the darkness of my hair’s delight,
Your lover’s eyes are touched again to sight:
“Knew I not you, Belovhd, and your heart,
No share had I with God nor any part
Within the world’s amazement of desires
Lit at life’s flaming incandescent fires.”
So am I comforted ; and happiness
Smiles at the prospect of its late distress.
Into the curving of your arms I turn
Swiftly as from an absence one may yearn
For home secure in love for love's own sake
That questions not nor knows one pale heart-
ache.
In this musk midnight of our vanity
The world has died, I think, for you and me ;
The foolish crowds that throng our lives by
day
Like pallid ghosts have gone their pallid way.
Only the stealthy wind steals past our dooi’ —
So frail, it seems not real any more.
Unlike that great noon wind we both have
loved,
Watching the branches of the pine-trees
moved
Against the background, blue, immense and
high,
Where all the dimpled hills lean on the sky.
Some day, Beloved. I shall know your child
As once your mother knew you when yon
smiled ;
And he shall be yourself—re-born my own —
And all love’s happiness that we have known
Shall lie within his deep, delicious eyes
That shine like mine and then like yours
are wise.
And he shall have a twin rose for his cheeks ;
And his shall be your voice that, when he
speaks.
I still shall hear its music fugitive
Across the longest day that I may live.
You wake and kiss me.. . .Why these foolish
tears
That are the rapture of a lover s fears?
Ah, dearest, for no idle thing I cry.
But for your love for which I live and die
A thousand lives and deaths of ecstasy
Unknown to all save lovers such as we.

AN INSPECTION OF THE BATTLE-
FIELD.
■‘An’ they ran an’ we ran, an’ we ran an’ they ran.
An’ they ran an’ we ran awa’, man;
An’ some say that we wan, an’ some say that they
wan,
An’ some say that nane wan at a’, man.”
—Scotch ballad of the Battle of Slieriffmuir. .
When there was leisure to take a survey
of the British political battlefield, and to
remove or poleaxe those of the wounded
who are better out of their misery, and to
cremate the dead, it became evident that
the late engagement would be no easy one
to describe. When one army disappears there
is a plain victory for the other. When both
take the back track in the darkness the event
is indecisive, which was the trouble with
the fight at Slieriffmuir. In the present case
three armies fought a triangular battle. Two
parties won because they increased their
numbers. The third won because it has a
bigger force left at its disposal than either of
the other winners. . But if winning means
that the winner is able to impose his will
on the others, then none won at all. The
Tariff Reform party certainly isn’t in a posi-
tion to carry Protection. But, equally,
Labor, the next strongest partv. though a
long way behind, isn’t in a position to carry
its “levy on capital.” The old orthodox
Liberal-Freetrade crowd, though it is the
smallest and most hopeless, may, for its part,
allege that it has achieved a victory because
its policy is to let things alone. But it isn’t
what used to be called a victory in days not
long ago, before the Cobdenite lion lost its
teeth and became ridiculously bald-headed
in the mane. Something like 20 years ago
the Unionist party was in office, having been
returned thereto by a majority of 134. It
chanced its existence on a very moderate
measure of Protection, for it only wanted
to discriminate sufficiently against foreign
countries to enable it to give a perceptible
discrimination in favor of the Dominions;
and Liberalism of the stalwart Freetrade
type came back from the country with a
majority of 356. That was a real victory—
Cobdenism had real victories in those days.
Now it lias come back with a minority of
over 356, and professes that the old glory
has returned. It is the lion in his old age
making a light lunch on a mouse.
* * * *
It can't be alleged, as in old days, that the
nation didn’t get a fair chance to express its
views. Until very recently the British fran-
chise was a crazy-quilt affair. To quote a
historian whose book was written early in
1918:
From 1884 to 1918 there was no further extension
of the franchise.... Only those voted who had some
one of the kinds of property indicated in the various
laws of 1832, 1867 and 1884. The condition of the
franchise was historical, not rational. Many men
possessed several votes, others none at a 11.... There
has been no redistribution .of Parliamentary seats
since 1885. There is no periodical readjustment
according to population, as in the United States after
each census. To-day some electoral districts are 10 or
even 15 times as large as others. Constituencies
range from about 13,000 to over 217,000.
It was under this out-of-date system that
Freetrade won its majority of 356 in 1906.
In fact, it has lived on that and even more
out-of-date systems since the beginning.
There were about 21 million voters in the
British Isles in 1867. There were seven mil-
lions or so in 1906. But the law' of 1918
greatly extended and liberalised the male
franchise; gave votes to mature females of
30 and over; almost, but not quite, extin-
guished the plural voter, and wholly wiped
out the multiple voter; made a clean sweep
of the old constituencies in which the num-
ber of electors was “from about 13,000 to
over 217,000.” The basis of representation in
the House of Commons was fixed at one mem-
ber for 70,000 inhabitants in Great Britain
and .one for 40,000 in Ireland. There were
2.1,775,000 electors on the roll before the de-
fection of the Irish Free State reduced the
number, and the size of the electorates, save
in Northern Ireland, was strikingly uniform.
It was. this electorate which, getting this
month, its first chance to be articulate about
the tariff, put Protection at the top of the
list and orthodox Freetrade at the foot. With
more time for thought it might have done
still better.
* * * *
When it was known that Prime Minister
Baldwin could no longer command a majo-
rity over the combined forces of Freetrade
and Labor, enthusiasm was expressed in
many questionable quarters. Among the
people who extracted hope from the situation
w r ere these varied elements:—
Germans and other foreign persons who desire to
raid the British market to an unlimited extent while
strenuously preserving their own markets—who con-
sider, in fact, that Protection is a very good thing
to ’wactise, but a shocking thing to have practised
against one.
The whole crowd of pro-Huns, defeatists, peace-
at-any-prieers and morbid pietists of the Woodrow
Wilson school, who believe that the way to show
a Christian spirit is to love every truculent foe to
the limit and hate all friends lika the very deuce.
Their view is that the Scripture bids them love their
enemies but says nothing about loving their friends,
and as they must hate somebody they exercise the
option.
All those who hunger for the dissolution of the
British Empire so that they may forage among the
ruins. A Protectionist Britain would have preference
to offer to the Dominions, which would create a
strong bond of mutual self-interest, but a Freetrade
Britain can offer nothing of the sort. The Domi-
nions may drift into the habit of using their extended
treaty-making powers to effect commercial alliances
with foreign States, because their own Cobdkn-
besotted parent will have none of them. As they
hitch their interests on to those of strange peoples,
the process of dissolution will proceed apace.
All the swinish multitudes which hunger to make
an end of civilisation, so that they may seek their
fortunes among the debris, after the manner of the
Eaters of Unclean Things who scavenged around old
Carthage. Asquith and co. interest these folk a
little because the Asquithites are pompous high-
brows whose dulness may help in the work of
empire destruction. But Ramsay Macdonald and
co. interest them immensely, and congratulations
upon Macdonald’s partial success have come from
the Communists of Russia, Italy, Australia, and' most
other places where these persons herd in appreciable
numbers, while Bolsheviks, I.W.W.’s, mixed criminals
and mixed freaks have joined in the approval. For
there are hopes that the proposed “levy on capital”
will only be a first taste of blood, and that the
second or third levy will complete the confiscation of
everything, and then the Communist Chaos will have
arrived, and all men will be mad and nominally
equal.
Britain will probably learn, as Australia
is learning, that the electoral constituency
may be a groat deal too wide. As regards
the enfranchisement of the poor equally with
the rich, there is no limit. Neither poverty
nor riches should come into the matter at all.
But there is need of much greater limitation
of the voting power of criminals, anarchists
and would-be destroyers of civilisation. There
is need that disfranchisement, for a lengthy
period or for life, should attach automati-
cally to a long list of offences, so that the
worst undesirables may not have a share in
the control of the country’s affairs, and may
not have a chance to capture some party
which, without them, might be patriotic and
honest. Then, while the truculent voter who
tried to wreck election proceedings by violent
means could be fined the habitual amount
for disturbance, the non-voter who did the
same could be ranked as a burglarious per-
son who had broken in where he didn’t be-
long, and be treated accordingly. Or pos-
sibly his conduct might be treated as sacri-
lege. That is defined as “profanation of a
sacred place or thing,” which description ap-
pears to fill the bill well enough. .
THE MISFIT.
A type of soldier stood out in all the armies
as soon as the late war got into its stride—
the misfit. There were plenty of good men
who never should have been soldiers. Sol-
diering has relatively little to do with hero-
ism or the patriotic virtues. Most healthy,
self-respecting white men are capable of fac-
ing shellfire, but in every war thousands have
found themselves unable to live up to the
exigencies of life behind the lines. They
cannot take seriously the innumerable regu-
lations with regard to such apparent triviali-
ties as shaven faces, polished buttons, tidy
billets and so on, and to that extent are un-
suited to a profession which demands blind
obedience. Others are given jobs in which
they have no prospect of success, and denied
the chance to do work they understand and
love. Nothing was commoner in the A. 1.1.
than to see butter-merchants and butchers on
courts-martial, while solicitors and barristers
inspected the men’s food. The fact of a
soldier having spent most of his life amongst
horses meant usually that when a draft was
required from the Remount depot he would be
overlooked, and the responsible business of
shepherding a couple of dozen valuable ani-
mals from Calais to the Somme entrusted to
a city clerk or shop-assistant, who was liable
to confuse spavins with stifles and windgalls
with withers. The economic waste result-
ing from this brainless system must have
been enormous, and it is proceeding on a ten-
thousand-fold greater scale in civil life to-
day.
• • * *
The chief cause of the unrest which came
in with the industrial revolution was neither
superior education nor inferior wages, but
distasteful work. The born singer will
cheerfully perform at all hours; the born
actor is eager to offer the public a taste of his
art, preferably for money, but if the money
is not there, for charity or merely to give
pleasure and thereby receive it; and the born
barrister or doctor or writer does not grudge
the grinding hours of overtime he spends on
his profession. On the other hand, there are
plenty of lawyers, journalists, doctors and
other black-coated practitioners whose daily
toil is an affliction to them, and who, in con-
sequence, “watch the clock” as assiduously as
any embittered pursuer of a dead-end calling.
These people are not loafers for preference:
no normal human being is. They are misfits
who, if they had had the luck to get into the
right groove early in life, would have reaped
happiness for themselves and profit for the
community. Few things are more saddening
to people of imagination than to visit one who
is failing in his chosen avocation and knows
it, and to find that in another walk of life he
would have been a brilliant success. A clerk
who loathes every minute he spends at his
desk is perhaps a natural cabinet-maker and
gets all his recreation from what others would
regard as hard work. Or he is a gardener,
who never knows a minute’s boredom, or any-
thing but a pleasurable form of fatigue, while
employed on heavy manual labor. Fishing
is a delight to some ; not merely hand-lining
but net-fishing and every other side of the
business. There are thousands of men eat-
ing their hearts out in poorly-paid city billets
who. if they were capable of sinking their
gentility, could earn twice as much by apply-
ing their education and energy to the fishing
industry, in which such qualities are con-
spicuously rare. In any event, vocational
success is not a matter of finding the most
highly-paid job: an immeasurably more im-
portant thing is to find the most congenial
job. A limelighting politician would be
wretched as a highly-salaried writer of un-
signed articles, while a publicity-hating jour-
nalist would recoil in horror from the thought
of taking the stump as a party politician, no
matter what the prospects were in the way of
emoluments.
* * * *
That something is wrong, that many round
holes are occupied by square pegs, is as uni-
versally admitted as it was in the armies
which muddled through the Great War. Edu-
cationists of all parties and denominations
seem to be agreed just now that the schools
are turning out too many professional men.
But there is no sense in stressing this obvious
truth unless a means of remedying the abuse
is indicated. The cure for too much profes-
sionalism is to a great extent the cure also
for too much cityism, and it consists in pre-
senting the public with an entirely new con-
ception of labor in its social aspect. The
same idiotic snobbishness which changes good
domestic servants into indifferent factory
hands is keeping thousands of young men in
black coats who should be working in their
shirt sleeves, and the first aim of the State
educational system should be to remove
the undemocratic superstition which is
at the root of this disaster. It should
be the easier to raise the mnna of
the trades inasmuch as that of the profes-
sions has fallen and is steadily going lower.
In the older countries people of wealth and
position are already running dairies, dress-
making shops, millinery establishments,
garages and restaurants without any dero-
gation from their importance. Others are
farmers, horse-dealers, poultry-breeders and
dog-fanciers. This is the outcome of pro-
paganda designed to show that honest labor
is social service, that it is just as honor-
able for a man to make an honest living
selling one thing'as another; and in Eng-
land to-day many who might once have
hesitated to own up to being connected with
a brewery are now contentedly, not to say
proudly, conducting their own public-houses.
There is no reason—outride a mediaeval con-
vention which is vanishing quickly even
from the royal Courts of Europe—why the
son of a squatter or solicitor' who hates
using his brains in examinations, but de-
lights to use his hands on woodwork, should
not become a furniture-maker; and boat-
building, plumbing, carpentering and a
dozen more trades might offer other edu-
cated misfits the chance, of substituting a
dull as well as profitless occupation for an
engrossing one, and one which: if intelli-
gently and determinedly tackled, might be
made to show a handsome profit. The edu-
cational authorities could assist this move-
ment, in the first place, by steadily insisting
on the equal dignity of every sort of honest
labor, and. in the second, by refusing to
conspire with parents to push young people
into unsuitable callings. The natural bent
of a boy has mostly been shown by 16 —
in the case of the average girl who has any
intellectuality whatever, the disclosure often
occurs earlier —and parents and school-
masters should be made to feel that they
have betrayed a sacred trust when they
encourage youngsters to go in for profes-
sions though plainly intended by nature for
trades. For the rest, the performance of
this duty would constitute the highest form
of patriotism : the nation which succeeds in
eliminating even a small proportion of its
misfits will gain tremendously in power, and
save correspondingly on the financial side.
A CHINESE REVOLUTIONARY.
Fob three weeks after young Lim’s million-
aire father died I did not sleep: I had the
misfortune to live next door the ornate
palace old Lim had erected in Penang to
house his Siamese harem. The expenses of
burial usually cripple the finances of a
Chinese family for years, but it would have
taken a long ceremony, unusual hordes of
priests and an incredible expenditure of
crackers to dissipate old Lim’s fortune. A
different and quite unprecedented fate
awaited it. Young Lim resembled many of
his countrymen in being as keen on spend-
ing money as on making it. During his
college career in America and his subsequent
travels in Europe he had imbibed revolu-
tionary notions. He had sat at the feet of
Russian anarchists in Geneva, and a study
of Karl Marx had shaken his beliefs. The
Chinese revolution was still pursuing its
complicated destiny, and to the horror of
his family he announced his intention of
offering his father's millions to the sacred
cause of freedom and the rights of man.
Mrs. Lim reviled her unnatural son for three
days and nights without succeeding in shak-
ing his resolution'. His own newly-wedded
wife threw her juvenile powers of vitupera-
tion into the balance without effect, and in
the end Lim, withdrawing a fabulous tale
of dollars from the Chartered Bank, dis-
appeared with it in the direction of China.
It was in Pickering’s Hotel on the Bub-
bling Well-road that I next met Lim.
Although only a few months had elapsed
old Lim’s millions had already suffered con-
siderable diminution. The agents of attri-
tion never forsook him day or night. Among
them were Chen Chi Mei, Military Gover-
nor of Shanghai native city, and Liu Fu
Biao, leader of a crack corps known as the
Dare-to-Dies, who had a reputation for reck-
less courage which he was believed to have
acquired from the habit of always drinking
the blood of the most heroic of the enemy
slain by his soldiers. Hovering in the back-
ground" were the agents of foreign arma-
ment firms with ammunition and guns to
sell which had been condemned in other
countries. These last, however, were com-
pelled to camouflage the nature of their
goods, and represent themselves as pur-
veyors of educational requisites.
The only member of Lim’s entourage
whose motives were above reproach was old
Admiral Faii, a straight, crisp, wizened
little man, with a perfectly ludicrous re-
semblance to a British naval officer —who
had, in fact, got his training in the British
Navy. Not being able to square his con-
science with the aims of any of the contend-
ing factions that had divided up the Chinese
Fleet, he had taken up his berth on shore
until the smoke should clear, llis warnings
had no effect on Lim, who when I met him
was subsidising, among other things, the
Republican Drum —a newspaper whose fiery
propaganda and cleverly masked incitements
to violence he never had the leisure to read
—a vast scheme for teaching barrow-coolies
a new system of romanised Chinese, the
woman’s suffrage movement, afforestation,
good roads, anti-footbinding and the preven-
tion of bribery and corruption. In this pro-
gramme there was ample room for the past-
masters of dissimulation with whom he was
surrounded to further their own perfectly
simple projects, which mainly consisted of
filling their pockets or increasing their war-
like stock for the military struggle which
everybody but Lim could plainly see was
coming.
Lim retained his belief in the power of
constitutionalism to cure China’s ills,
although the Peking Parliament had already
been for some years in existence without
having agreed on the rules of its own pro-
cedure. What the country required, he told
me, was an educated democracy; and he
sent more of his father’s millions to Japan
to finance a mass attack of Japanese teach-
ers and textbooks. Shortly after this a
Japanese steamer was wrecked —by agree-
ment —on the coast of Kiangsu. The land-
ing of its cargo in barges that appeared as if
by magic from nowhere was the signal for
the bursting of the war-cloud. Fighting be-
tween the Peking troops and the forces of
the revolution began in various places.
Lim’s entourage became extraordinarily
active, and he began to realise that in some
mysterious way, on the voyage from Shimo-
noseki, the textbooks he had paid for had
turned into six-inch shells and the Japanese
teachers into military officers.
As the drama developed Lim grew more
distressed. The spectacle of his father’s
hard-earned cash being dissipated in smoke
jarred on his business sense as well as his
pacific temperament, and he decided that at
all costs the slaughter must be stopped. His
naval adviser, Admiral Faii, pointed out
the undoubted fact that the key to the situa-
tion was the command of the sea, and pro-
posed that Lim should expend the remaining
moiety of his fortune in purchasing the neu-
trality of the Chinese Fleet, adding that if
the venture were successful Lim would cer-
tainly be able to recover from the victorious
constitutionalists all that he had expended,
with possibly a substantial interest on his
money. The transaction was completed
promptly, and the next evening Lim waited
anxiously for the inevitable offensive. It
burst forth with more than usual vigor, but
there was no purchased silence on the part
of the naval section —the fleet continued its
bombardment of the rebel lines with greater
zest than ever. It appeared afterwards that
Admiral Faii’s emissary had bought all the
naval ratings below the rank of gunner, but,
finding the officers’ demands so exorbitant
that if they were met little would be left
to pay his own commission, he had gone no
further with the business, but had burnt a
few joss-sticks for luck instead.
The upshot of Lim’s perturbations was
an attempt to blow up the Chinese
flagship by means of a torpedo which
he and a friend lashed to a pole
attached to the bow of a chartered
motor-launch. Their intention was to put
the launch full speed ahead at the warship,
and. when they were assured of their aim,
to jump overboard and leave the launch to
do the rest. The attempt failed ow r ing to
the unexpected vigilance of the flagship’s
sentries, and the launch was picked up by
a passing sampan and its occupants handed
over to the Chinese authorities. The news
papers made great capital of the heroism of


the unknown revolutionaries, but they missed
the real poignancy of the situation, which
was List’s devoted attempt to destroy the
maleficent activities of his own money.
The complete collapse of the rebel cause
made life unhealthy for revolutionaries even
in the foreign settlement, and Lim’s friends,
withdrawing their balances from. the banks,
vanished in the direction of Tokio. As for
Lim’s • dollars, matter being indestructible,
they went on propagating themselves for
good and evil. As for Lim himself, Chinese
justice is ruthless in spirit but mercifully
inefiicient in practice, so Lim escaped, lie
had only to don a blue jacket and a pair
of baggy pants for the friendly ocean of
China’s cotton-clad masses to open and
swallow him up. But a Chinaman of liis
business tradition could not remain long in
the static condition of a coolie. When I
met him again he was already bidding fair
to recover all his millions. I was travelling
ac the time in a houseboat attached to a
boat-train along the tangled network of a
provincial river-system. When night fell
the long string of house-boats, barges and
sampans towed by a steam launch did not
tie up for the night, although we were in
bandit country. It continued its asthmatic
way, confident in the knowledge that its
passports, vised by the brigand chief
through whose territory we were steaming,
were good for another 50 miles, after which
we would come within the jurisdiction of a
cut-throat with a blood-curdling reputation
for eating children, named Lit the Earless.
Consequently there was considerable indig-
nation amongst the native passengers when
shortly after dark the winding cavalcade
was greeted with a fusillade of machine-
gun fire and rifle bullets from the direction
of the shore. Obviously there had been
graft somewhere, and the launch captain
headed for the bank to demand an explana-
tion. The light of a lantern illuminated the
legs of a band of armed and uniformed
scoundrels who were standing waiting for
us. “It is Lu the Earless,” whispered a
missionary who was crouching with me in.
the cockpit of the houseboat. I recognised
Lu and the perfect oval of his face. The
bandit business was the last investment Lim
had made with the remnant of his father's
fortune. It was an insanitary and violent
occupation, but there was still room in it
for pacifist ideals. “What China needs,”
he explained to me with modest sincerity,
“is a strong man. As you see, I am gradu-
ally extending my dominions.” The opera-
tion of collecting dues having been com-
pleted, the bandits scrambled back on to the
bank, and Lim proceeded to endorse our
passports. “The Revolution has done me
some good, at any rate,” he said before we
parted. He lifted up the flaps of his Man-
churian cap and showed me where his ears
had been neatly shaved off close to the head.
“They always did stick out, you know,” he
added with a gentle laugh.

Suggested Compulsory Loan for Russia.
Australia is making, or is invited to make,
its appearance in the new character of inter-
national financier. This sudden breaking-
away from the past suggests the need for a
Federal law, if none exists already, making
the consent of the Attorney-General and the
Auditor-General necessary before any foreign
loan is floated inside the Commonwealth,
putting it under supervision after the consent
is given, and endowing the Government with
authority to intercept the money if circum-
stances look too suspicious. Some loans go
to finance enemies and stir up foreign strife
and complications. Some go for purely
criminal purposes. Some don’t go at alt,
but stay in the pockets of the promoters.
Our modest beginning takes the shape of a
proposal to raise £200,000 at 5 per cent,
allegedly for Soviet Russia. Subscribers
are requested not to apply for the 5 per
cent., but to look on the loan as a brotherly
act; but. sordid souls who want their interest
will get it, if they have luck. The responsible
parties, whoever they may be, will repay in
1933, provided they are alive, in funds, out
of gaol, and feel like it. Theoretically
this is a free country, and any fool can send
his money to any fool’s paradise, for any
fool’s purpose. But as the departure of
money reduces the national stock of cash
(which is restricted just now) and that is
everybody’s business, the Government
assumes a power of interference. That is
among the things a tariff is for—-to quote
only one instance. The present situation is
that one Hersecovici has arrived from Rus-
sia, on beggary bent and to mendicancy
inclined. Now, the “Russian Socialist
Federal Soviet Republic” has enjoyed for six
years the blessings of an allegedly ideal form
of government. It has enjoyed internal
peace for years, and has had no foreign
wars of any size since the new regime began.
The • country is free from debt and big in-
terest bills, so it has an advantage over all
other lands—it is free because it repudiated
everything. It pays no royal family, no
hereditary aristocracy, no expensive church
(the national religion is atheism) and no
big landlords. The military usurpers of 1917
began by establishing national ownership of
“the entire means of production, distribu-
tion and exchange,” including “all lands,
forests, mines, waters having a national im-
portance, and all live stock and fixtures. . . .
factories, railways and other means of pro-
duction and transport.” People from these
parts, whose names it is needless to mention,
visited Russia, and came back attesting that
they had found a land of peace and plenty.
Some added, as a special bit of local color,
that the happy Soviet toilers, all hand-in-
hand, strolled or clumped about, like shep-
herds in Arcadia, singing songs in sheer
lightness of heart, and cut gambols in the
streets. Without retracting a word of these
robust narratives, it is the mission of the
mysterious Mr. Hersecovici to scratch
together £200,000 from this land of capital-
ists and wage-slaves and priests and parsons
and landlords, on the ground that even an
md. of id. per Russian is better than nothing.
It is added that the horrors of the situation
are so widely recognised that in 24 other
countries (not specified) the hat is being
passed in the same cause. It was before
the N. S. Wales Labor Council that the
Muscovite envoy laid liis case, last week, and
that remarkable body gave way to enthusi-
asm. Baddeley, M.L.A., declared that “if
the loan were subscribed the investors’ inter-
ests would be safeguarded,” and added that
“his own name would go on every Australian
bond.” In other words, he offered his per-
sonal security for the whole £200,000 and
any further loans, for it was pointed out
that the movement need not stop at any
particular point. Finally the Labor Council
resolved unanimously “to do all within our
power to assist in every way” at raising big
money for Mr. lleksecovici and his inter-
national committee—located at Berlin, where
they pay in paper marks. And it was pointed
out' by the enthusiastic Baddeley that the
unions could easily “strike levies” and
“rapidly build up the sum required.” In
other words, the idea developed of making
the business a conscript or forced contri-
bution. It. might be best to go slow about
this part of the enterprise. Some Austra-
lians are a little weary of seeing the law
courts used for the collection of even local
strike levies. Any attempt to use them in
order to raise money for an alleged inter-
national committee at Berlin, and for the
alleged benefit of a Soviet paradise in Rus-
sia, might lead this country to suddenly and
violently reconsider the whole position. A
community has got down pretty close to the
slave level when it can be dragooned into
unions, and then, being in, be forced to lend
its savings to any wandering alien who bites
the ear of its bosses; but even the worst out-
rage may be carried too far.

To Elevate the Tone of Parliament.
Once 30 or 40 years ago a member of the
N. S. Wales Parliament carried another
member round under his arm in search of a
retired spot in which to wallop him. Such
scrimmages are known no longer; but lan-
guage has grown incomparably worse, and
manners, except bad ones, have to a great
extent died out. A tirade of abuse directed
by one member at another can now be com-
pleted in peace, whereas in better times it
would have been stopped less than half-way
by a whirling disturbance in which from two to
ten members had a share, while the Speaker
endeavored to conceal his yearning to use
his mace as a club. Patience, however, has
its limits, and the most degenerate and fish-
blooded generation may have to draw the
line somewhere. The latest (and record)
unpleasantness broke out between Laborite
Davidson and ex-Laborite and one-time
Minister McGirr. The case was something
to this effect: —
The former said that the fatter, who runs drug
stores in various towns, did a thriving business in
abortion and venereal disease, and (this was a drama-
tic touch) brought unwholesome females of bad
character to the towns where he practised in order
to make business.
The latter said that the former had been dummy-
ing land under a false name, and having left that
business he came to Parkes and took up his residence
with two (no more) ladies of indubitably dubious
character. Also that he became a venereal subject
himself as the result of his depravity, and was
treated as such by MoGirr's manager at McGirr's
emporium. Whereupon the ex-Minister dropped the
subject and quitted the august Chamber.
His adversary replied to the empty seat where
McGirr had been, to the effect that he had never
lived with two Rahabs at Parkes, that he had never
lived in Parkes at all, and naturally had never been
a patient at McGirr’s emporium there.
Apart from this collection of charges and
counter-charges there was one thing Which
McGirr didn’t mention. While he was Min-
ister for Health and Motherhood venereal
disease became notifiable in N. S. Wales;
but the law wasn’t enforced, and the man
who drew a big salary for enforcing it
dropped it, on his own authority, into the
waste-paper basket. Still nobody assumed or
assumes from this that he had any business
interest in the spread of venereal disease. It
was set down to unspeakable laziness ami un-
limited incompetence. However, this is a
side-issue; the matter of the moment is the
cleaning up of a political institution which
has become too like a cesspool. If it is
much longer delayed there is danger that
the choice of members will be limited to the
“push” section of the community. Nothing
is gained by hoping that things will grow
better. Things are always ready and will-
ing to grow worse, but they have to be
made better. Hence the need for reformers,
whereas there is no need for a specific class
of degenerators. Dirt accumulates of itself,
while cleanliness doesn’t. There is little
prospect of improvement in the occasional
spasmodic expulsion of an unpleasant per-
son, even if it were possible for him to be
unpleasant enough to lead to expulsion. A
continuous and automatic process of purifi-
cation is called for. A good deal might be
achieved by the abolition of “privilege” as
between members. A politician who “says
things” about another outside the House is
liable for his words, and notable results
should follow if the inside of the House was
made the outside also. Before the worst Bil-
lingsgaters settled down to the new and im-
proved order of affairs there might be a
brisk issue of civil and criminal writs, and
some members might be in gaol, and some
might be in foreign parts, and unable to
come back on account of damages, costs and
bankruptcy proceedings. But there would
be a remarkable change in the tone of the
Assembly, and a growing change in the
class of men who applied for admission to
the Assembly. An education test for candi-
dates would raise the mental standard of the
House; the abolition of the much-abused
“privilege” should about complete the good
work.

Cotton-growing in Queensland.
Dear Buixetin, —Your Digger correspon-
dent (B. 6/12/’23) gave you the bedrock
facts—or some of them. The truth of the
cotton tragedy is that Theodore, being
closely occupied with smoothing the way for
the Millennium, fell down on his job of mak-
ing increased provision for ginning the 1021
crop that ran into thousands of acres where
it had hitherto been only hundreds, and had
to call in Crawford Vaxgiian and liis people.
The result was that Queensland was swiftly
over-run by cotton-experts—mostly from
South Aus., where no cotton is grown. With
£400,000 of nominal capital behind it the
British-Australian Cotton Association floated
into the picture as ginner-in-chief to the
Theodore Government until July, 1926 ; and
unauthorised ginneries are in the same cat-
egory as illicit stills or coining plants. The
charge for ginning is L[d. per lb. of lint,
or more than double that paid by the Ameri-
can grower, in addition to which the co.
helps itself to the seed. Three tons of seed
cotton yield one ton of lint and two of seed
(average), and the relative positions of the
Australian and American growers are:—
Ginning Cost Offset Against Value of Seed
(Upland Cotton).
Cost of Value of
Ginning- 2 tons Grower’s
State. 1 ton Lint. of Seed. Dr. or Cr.
Texas .. £7.60 £B.BO Cr. £1.20
Arkansas . . 5.60 9.40 Cr. 3.80
Mississippi . . 5.10 10.00 Cr. . 4.90
S. Carolina . . 4.25 9.50 Cr. 5.25
Georgia .. 4.75 10.90 Cr. 6.15
Alabama .. 4.20 11.00 Cr. 6.80
Average .. £5.40 £9.90 C'r. £4.45
Queensland '. . £11.66 £9.33 Dr. £21.00
At the time this agreement was made the
grower was ratooning his crop under the
supervision of the then Government adviser,
and it w r as the produce from those largely-
ratoon crops that attracted attention to
Queensland as a cotton-producing country.
Then the famous delegation arrived amid a
fusillade of corks and started to strafe
ratoon. It did not appear illogical that they
blessed Queensland cotton (mostly ratoon)
with one voice, and cursed it (as ratoon)
with another. The delegation urged the pass-
ing of anti-ratoon legislation, and Theo-
dore, in desperate need of a friend or two over
in Britain, let his own cotton-grower down
hard, and it is now illegal to have a ratoon
plant on the premises. Having promised the
legislation, and knowing that the secret
agreement would leak out before Parliament
expired by effluxion of time in October, the
Government, w r ith as many faces as a flock
of sheep, rushed the elections on five months
before they were due. The net result is
that applicants for cotton-seed to plant this
year fell by 28.4 per cent., and the area by
26.2 per cent., on last year’s figures, Mean-
while the ratoon that has been ploughed
under is persisting in bursting through, and
a lot of it is now forming bolls, rain or no
rain, while seedling plants get scorched off
as often as they break surface. The ratoon
has also been a valuable stock-fodder during
the drought, with the added value that it
set to work producing cotton as soon as the
stock was taken off it. Hovering over the
whole tangle is the extreme uncertainty of
Spring rains in Queensland. A recent depu-
tation that waited on Earle Page in Rock-
hampton pointed out that in the last 42 years
36.5 per cent, of the total 504 months had
double the average for the whole period, but
63.5 per cent, of them had only 0.44 of it.
Summarised, the row boils down to: —
1. A small section of Lancashire spinners have got
the Theodore Government tied up by some as yet
undivulged process, and now demand that Queensland
growers produce cotton to an exacting specification.
It also abhors ratoon.
2. A lot of English, Continental and Japanese spin-
ners will take all the ratoon cotton that Queensland
can grow, provided it is up to the not-vevy-high
standard of samples submitted.
3. Annual cotton depends on Spring rains, and they
are a gamble.
4. Ratoon cotton can be grown on millions of
acres of land that will only carry stock otherwise,
because of patchy Spring rains.
5. An annual crop that fails can be fed down
with stock, cut off at ground-level, the ground worked
and cleaned up. It will then produce an assured crop
next year, drought or no drought.
6. The whole of the expert damnation of the
ratoon comes from people who never grew an acre
of cotton in Queensland, or else from their hirelings.
Incidentally, the shareholder in the Cotton
Association appears to be waking up to the
fact that abolition of ratoon means less work
for his ginneries and consequently diminished
profits; that his cash is sunk in big central
ginneries which are opposed to the commu-
nity and co-operative ginning of cotton ; that
the grower swears he is going to run his
own co-operative gins as soon as the agree-
ment expires; and that 1926 might see his
cash tied up in idle ginneries, unless he goes
out and grows cotton to keep them going.—
Yours Cleveland.

The Myth of the Iron Jaw.
Good Napoleonites, who would not allow a
little matter like fact to stand in the way
of their admiration of a hero, assure us that
the battle of Waterloo took the turn it did
because the French leader had an attack of
bile. A good many of the most momentous
decisions of human policy have been made in
moments of irritation and exasneration and
then explained, excused and clung to
through days and years when their author
must have been convinced of their futility.
A statesman’s indigestion is as likely to
cause a war as any moral or economic ques-
tion ; and the fear on the part of weak men
of their own weakness makes them cleave to
the thing which is obviously wrong. Few
men would make any claim to infallibility;
but most men in practice try to act as if
they did claim it. Having said a thing, they
are unwilling to allow themselves ever to be
convinced that it is wrong. Little people,
raised to momentary power by a democratic
vote, try to nod like Jove. In all statecraft
will has been put above thought; strength
above honesty of aim. Thought is a con-
tinually moving thing—a thing that changes,
grows, crystallises and then breaks up into
new atoms for further change, growth and
re-crystallisation. Apart from that back-
ground of change and reconstruction, energy
may be a worse thing than mere blind stag-
nation. The iron will to do a stupid thing
is a disastrous evil. What the world needs
most in its statesmen is the courage to say
“I beg your pardon : I was w T rong.” Little
States sprang up in Europe in 1918 and 1919
like mfushroomS after a wmrrn rain; their
emergence was a clear statement to the
world that nationality was the only sound
basis of government and that the aggrega-
tion of many discordant units under one
political headship was mere foolishness,
which could make neither for economic pro-
gress nor for military success. But the little
States started immediately to ape the ways
of their former masters. Dozens of small
Bismarcks with slender intelligence and
iron jaws determined to bullock things
through to their own glory; and every one
tried to grab an alien parish or two from
some neighbor or to engineer some combine
of particles that might preserve a few of the
worst features of the thing from which the
Great War was supposed to have liberated
them. All over the world the tradition of
the granite jaw and the chilled-steel will
has been accepted as a thing desirable. In-
stead of shaping politics on the model of
the fruitful garden, the idea has grown that
walls are the chief need —stony and un-
breakable fortifications about set ideas that
are sacred because of their sheer weight and
immobility. Yet obviously the thing wanted
is the brain to conceive rather than the mere
will to execute anything or nothing. The
general idea that if mistakes are enforced
they cease to be mistakes must be given up.
The real statesman of the future must be
the man who is willing to admit mistakes
and boldly try the other road. Thousands
of political catch-words have been coined
to meet special occasions; but the one we
most need is “Brains in politics.” The
strong man is not strong in any real sense
unless he is a man of wide knowledge and
ready intelligence. Let us frankly admit
that less has been done in the science of
human government than in any other field
of work and investigation. Our constitutions
are thin, weak things; our legislation has
been a poor makeshift the world over; our
party cries are shallow and unconvincing.
It is no earthly use having a man with an
iron jaw playing at upholding this sort of
loose rubbish; we need the man of vivid
imagination and flexible brain to evolve
order out of the chaos. Germany, with
bounteous harvests and postage-stamps of
the value of 10 million marks on its corres-
pondence, twiddles its fingers at its nose over
the world’s financial tangles. The strike
committee and the employers’ association are
just as ridiculous as 10-million-mark postage.
Yet we go on the old way; and brilliant
statecraft consists in saying the old thing in
slightly different words—with an iron jaw.

“Pure” Meat.
“Dr. Nil” on fetiches and filth :
Apropos the strike of the drivers of the meat-
trollies at the abattoirs in Adelaide. A good many
years ago the City Council borrowed £300,000 and
constructed an “up-to-date” slaughtering establish-
ment some miles out of town and passed by-laws
prohibiting the killing of stock for the supply of
meat in the Metropolitan area at any place exceot
these abattoirs. The excuse offered for this expendi-
ture was that thus they could ensure to the public
“a supply of pure meat”—whatever the latter might
be. The only difference in the meat thus available
was that it became suddenly dearer, not on account
of any change in prices of live-stock, but because
of the additional and continuously increasing over-
head costs of killing and delivering to the retail
butchers. One “advantage” was that whenever the
unions concerned in the “meat industries” wanted
a rise in wages, or any other “improved condition ’
they were promptly given it, the extra cost being
handed on to the consumers. The drivers (about
18 in number) have now indulged in a “lightning
strike” for higher wages, and left the public without
any fresh meat at all, “pure” or otherwise.
This may be another of the “advantages,” which
have all been tolerated by meat consumers under the
impression that they (the consumers) were at least
saved from the dangers of eating meat killed by the
retail butchers. The implication was that this meat
was “impure” and unsafe for human consumption,
whereas that slaughtered at the abattoirs was’ “pure”
and safe. Now, I have been practising medicine in
S.A. for over 30 years. I have not during that time
ever met with a case of illness arising from the
consumption of fresh butcher’s meat. For 10 years
of the period mentioned, during the existence of
the abattoirs monopoly, I was medical-officer for a
populous suburb. I interrogated numerous fellow
country and city practitioners as to their experience
regarding illness caused by fresh-meat consumption,
and could find none who had ever known of a case.
The reason is self-evident. Butchers’ meat is always
cooked by the consumer, and even diseased meat,
when cooked, seldom, if ever, causes illness. One
admits that the idea of eating diseased meat is
repulsive; but that is not the point. Practically
the whole huge extra expense caused by the abattoir
system is unnecessary and waste.
But (and here is the point) no precautions are
taken by the civic authorities against the spread of
disease by the supply and consumption of other
food stuffs. For instance, bread. Who has not seen
loaves being handed out from bakers’ carts after
having been exposed to the dust of the street —dust
composed of various kinds of filth —and mauled by
filthy hands, and coughed and sneezed upon? What
precautions are taken against the disease germs that
infest the “fresh” fruit and vegetables that are eaten
raw after having been packed by the growers in
dirty boxes, or heaped up loose in trollies which on
the return journey carry manure to the gardens,
and which are seldom, if ever, washed ? And milk!
Go into any cowyard in the suburbs and watch it
being handled! Milking pails washed (if washed
at all) in filthy water ; cows milked by filthy hands ;
delivery carts racing about from squalid “dairies”
in wet or dusty weather, and the “finished” product
baled out by unclean dippers into still more unclean
jugs and left at the back door for the flies and cats
to have access to! And then it is taken in
and drunk in impura naturaUbus —by the children.
And “small goods”! But enough. No doubt we
deserve what we get, but we don’t deserve to have
to pay £300,000 to build (and God knows how much
more to maintain) an establishment that assures us
“pure” meat, leaving all these and many other foods
impure.
Small Sister’s Troubles.
The ease for the little one:—
Though there is a good deal of grumbling in the
ranks of Tasmanian Nationalists over the fact that
a Labor Government has fluked oflice, nobody is
really very indignant about it. Of course no respect-
able Tory is desirous of “giving Labor Ministers a
show” in any genuine and protracted sense, but it
is certain that nobody who is not desperately
enamored of office is anxious to take on the job of
straightening out the State finances a t present. So
Premier Lyons, after appointing an Advisory Board
to suggest methods of extending industries "in such
form as to annex the cheap loans offered by Britain
for five years, was given a free hand to negotiate
with Eakle Page for a Commonwealth lift of about
a million, extending over 10 years.
Whatever natural advantages the Speck may
possess are more than offset by her smallness and her
isolation and her ruggedness. Roads and rails are
expensive to lay and maintain, and every bit of her
produce that her handful of 200,000 people can’t
consume is separated from the nearest market by 250
miles of bumpy sea. And with the greatest imagin-
able desire for economy among present-day Tassies,
there is no possible immediate means of breaking
away from the pre-Federation habit of running the
show on expensive “sovereign State” lines.
Many of the Nationalists make no secret of rheir
earnest desire to see Lyons successful. If he does

happen to get the money the Nats, have merely
to sink their little differences in order to squeeze
the Labor Ministers out of office and keep the spend-
ing of the grant in “proper hands.” But if he fails
to impress the Commonwealth Ministers with the
justice of Tasmania’s claim —well, so much the
worse for Labor’s political reputation and for Lyons’s
chance of securing a Labor majority at the elections.
Besides, all will not have been lost for the Nat.
cause if Lyons fails to collect from Dr. Page. State
Ministers of the right brand might succeed where a
Labor Premier failed. From a party viewpoint the
Nationalists seem to have the best of the prospects.
But meanwhile the most uncompromising anti-Labor
dailies are treating Premier Lyons tenderly, as a
possibly useful catspaw ought to be treated.
On the other hand, Lyons, who is no slouch at the
game of party warfare, may fashion even a failure
with Earle Page into a hefty weapon with which
to belabor his opponents. The position will be
that, failing the Commonwealth either granting sub-
stantial financial assistance or taking over the whole
administration of the State, the local people will
have to get themselves out of their mess by their
own efforts. This means increased taxation (especi-
ally on the half-million of unearned land values the
Tasmanian landowners annex every year) and a severe
cutting down of overhead expenses. This last must
include the sudden abolition of one House of Parlia-
ment and the complete wiping out of the State Gov-
ernorship. It will he as plain as the nose @n the
elector’s face that, if the Commonwealth declines to
help, it will be impossible to retain any luxuries.
“Of the million-pound loan just raised in London,”
the Attorney-General said the other day, “nearly
£600,000 goes at once to liquidate interest pay-
ments due, and the balance is all either already
spent by our predecessors in advance or rigidly ear-
marked for current necessities. The Treasury has
nothing but an overdraft, and we do not' know where
to turn for a shilling.”
Party politics aside, there is a growing local feel-
ing that something akin to gratitude is due to the
Premier for the clearness with which he has pre-
sented the case for his State. He has shown,
for the first time, that Tasmania has less taxable
capacity than the larger States. Although she col-
lects 18s. per head from income-tax and stamp duties
in connection with Tattersall’s —a tax which is obvi-
ously paid by all Australia, and when, deducted
makes Tasmania’s taxation per head look not un-
reasonably high—there still remains a vast differ-
ence between the Speck’s capacity to pay and that of
her neighbors. The true criterion of the relative
severity of taxation is, as Lyons says, the relation of
taxation per head to income per head. On this basis
(the only way of ascertaining relative income in
the different States is through Federal income-tax
assessments, and 1920-21 are the latest figures pub-
lished by the Federal Taxation Commissioner) Lyons
claims that “Tasmanian State taxation relative to
income or ability to pay income-tax, so far from
being the lightest in the Commonwealth, is very
much more severe than in the large States or for
Australia as a whole.” If this claim is borne out
by a careful examination of the Federal Taxation
Commission’s more recent figures, it is difficult to see
how the Commonwealth can turn down the Govern-
ment’s request for a helping hand, though it will
certainly be entitled to a clear statement of what
the State is prepared to do for itself.

Wine and Freedom.
“L.E.”: For small mercies, such as the
modification of the liquor restrictions, we
inhabitants of Victoria nowadays have to be
thankful. More bottles may make their
appearance between the mystic hours of
six and eight; and on special occasions
wine may remain on the table even later.
It isn’t much to boast about; but in these
degenerate days of eugenics, censorship of
morals, State control of public and private
affairs, and general prohibition of everything
people want, when there is less personal free-
dom than in the darkest days of the
Roman Empire under the poet Nero, or the
racehorse owner Caligula, a law that
permits a citizen occasionally to take a medium
beer with his dinner assumes the dimensions of
a Magna Charta. If we are not ceaselessly vigi-
lant we will wake up one day and find our-
selves caught in the machinery of the servile
State, as G. K. Chesterton predicts. He
regards wine or beer as the symbol of free-
dom, of a humane civilisation. A pewter by
the counter’s brim is much more than a
mere long beer to him ; lie relates it most
ingeniously to far-off problems, of economics,
of history, of religion. Indeed, it has been
objected against Chesterton that he has
so entangled the issue in a maze of romantic
speculation that the plain blunt man is too
bewildered to drink his beer in peace. Yet
in England, which still has a tradition of
freedom unknown in the United States, he
does much better than Uncle Sam, who pays
50 cents for a queer-colored concoction in
a chemist’s shop, and comes out with a
hiccough worth a dollar. If Freedom shrieked
when Kosciusko fell, it must have made a
noise like the soldiers’ chorus in “Faust”
when our soda-fountain Cato arose. The
idea at the back of most modern legislation
is that man is only a cog in the economic
machine, and no longer a free spiritual being.
If he drinks icecream-soda instead of beer
it has been surmised that next morning he
will be able to shift more bags of chaff or
sell more safety-razors. A typical Ameri-
can genius like Taylor has reduced man,
the alleged lord of creation, absolutely to a
machine whose worth is estimated by the
number of foot-pounds of energy it can pro-
duce per hour. Lenin took a fancy to the
Taylor system, stopped the drink and tried
to see how many foot-pounds of energy Ivan
could throw off; but the Russian statistics
of this experiment are not yet to hand. In
Latin countries that are too decadent to
adopt such advanced American ideas, poet
or peasant would be greatly astounded if a
decree were issued by a soft-drinks Robes-
pierre setting forth how and when
he was to take his bottle of beaune
or chianti, or ordering him not to take
it at all. One would think that their
free-and-easy open-air cafds, where people
could come at night, even after 8 o’clock,
to meet their friends, and drink wine, ana
abolish free verse or cubism, and curse the
politicians, and listen to music, and gather up
some ideas and energy for the next day,
ought to suit a bright climate and an out-
door race like ours.

The Decay of Independence.
A people may lose their independence just
as swiftly and surely through an over-dose
of so-called benevolence as through an over-
dose of despotism. The trouble is that this
truth is not always apparent. If Jock
Garden were to break out one day, and with
the aid of an army of communists establish
himself as a dictator, there would be a rush
to arms of indignant liberty-lovers; and if
the indignant liberty-lovers found any arms
when they rushed, which is doubtful, Jock
Garden and his horde of highwaymen would
get a rough handling. But if Stanley Bruce
were to develop overnight an abnormal bump
of benevolence, and rushed forth to subsidise*
every institution, industry and individual
that seemed in the slightest degree shaky
on its financial legs, there wouldn’t be any
rush to arms. There might be a rush to
NOT ITER FIRST PREFERENCE.
REJECTED SUITOR: “But can’t you give me any encouragement at all?”
THE FLIPPANT MAID: “Oh, yes! You can take your chance at the next by-clection.”
the pubs to celebrate, but no one would
recognise the robbery of his independence as
such, though it might be much more absolute
than anything Jock Garden could effect, if
he revolushed in the manner suggested. In
Australia at present, as a result partly of a
plethora of political benevolence, partly of
the credit system that prevails everywhere,
independence is decaying. “Easy terms” has
become the most effective bait for catching
flathead and jellyfish in every line of busi-
ness. In the cities credit is extraordinarily
extended and values inflated" accordingly.
You can buy houses, land, jewellery, furni-
ture, clothes, feed for your race pony, motor-
ears—anything at all on easy terms. The
whole rotten system develops the national
habit of leaning up against posts to a dan-
gerous degree. Things are nearly as bad in
the country as in the city. Consider the
deplorable results of our closer settlement
schemes, and search for the reasons. Only
the craziest enthusiast can claim that Gov-
ernment closer settlement has been anything
but a howling failure. And why? Simply
because the paying of interest on the purchase
price of land bought in a boom (and boom
prices and political benevolence inevitably
run together) is an overwhelming handicap,
and politicians out of their great generosity
insist that capital is an unimportant part
of a settler’s equipment. The settler depen-
dent on the Government for everything in
the beginning doesn’t cultivate independence
as he goes along. He doesn’t get a chance,
and, all things considered, perhaps he doesn’t
want a chance. While new settlers very fre-
quently don’t appear to have much indepen-
dence to lose, the old settlers are losing what
they once had. When the farmer gets up
against it now. ho doesn't as of old prune
his expenses down to a minimum, tighten
up his belt, and buckle down to work harder
than ever. The stores give him extensive
credit, and he gets behind there, and firms
sell him machinery and manure and so forth
on easy terms, and he gets behind further
there. Then, when the private firms and
the private bank turn him down, which isn’t
until he has become a truly awful spectacle
of financial embarrassment, he goes hat in
hand begging on some politician’s doorstep.
He is supplied with seed-wheat,'and fodder,
and further credit, and off he goes again.
Bad seasons and low prices are invariably
blamed for the failure of so many farmers,
but the truth is that most of the disaster
ought to be debited to the decay of inde-
pendence resultant from an overdose of easy
terms. This decay of independence manifests
itself everywhere. There -was a time when
we were inclined to pay our way or there-
abouts, and do what we could to establish a
system of national defence. To-day we are
content to sponge on J. Bull for'the cash
to support our economical life and the navy
to sustain our national life. A State
Treasurer who can produce even the small-
est of surpluses is whipped from pillar to
post for his unpopular thriftiness, and a
Defence Minister who proposes to do some-
thing to justify his job is denounced by one
crowd as a disloyalist and by another as a
swashbuckling militarist. Extravagant ex-
penditure to buttress up booms and provide
multitudinous jobs for the futile has come
to be a thing expected from every Govern-
ment, and in consequence we have evolved a
type of politician whose special asset is his
aggressive affability. That this sort of
thing cannot go on indefinitely is certain.
The trouble is that the halt has been post-
poned so long that when it is finally called,
or, what is more likely, calls itself, it is
bound to be a pretty painful affair.
Of course we shall retain trial by jury;
but we shall certainly have to do something
with it. Consider two recent cases, one
civil and the other criminal. The first civil
party sued the second before a jury for libel
damages, and after a mountain of costs got
half a mouse of a verdict. The two had
another go before another jury, and this
time the first party lost his costs and got no
mouse. The first party appealed against the
second verdict to a court where there was no
jury, and it decided, in effect, that that
much-lauded body was an ass. It reversed
the jury's decision, and ordered the person
to whom the jury had given costs to pay
costs instead. Also, it ordered another trial
before another jury, which will probably be
likewise appealed against as a thing of de-
ficient intelligence which shouldn’t be at
large. Meanwhile the second party appealed
against the first verdict. A court with no
jury gave him permission to appeal
to a bigger court with no jury for
permission to take the case to an
English court which never had a jury in
its life and would shudder at the sight of
the vulgar thing. The application was re-
fused, but that was a detail. As regards
the criminal case, it took four trials and
quite a swag of juries to get the defendant
a term of gaol for the disorderly act of
cremating his employer in a place not
set apart for the purpose. He was
convicted of various things before any-
one thought of charging him with cre-
mation, but the jury was always wrong.
It all suggests that even the limited service
juries once did in finding prompt verdicts
against witches may have been due to the
fact that the witch never had the price of an
appeal about her, and also that she was
burnt before the rising of the court.
‘“Hanno” : The efforts which are being made
by the Pharmaceutical Society to induce the
Federal Government to remove the duty on
imported sera and vaccines are dictated by
commercial interests. Prior to the imposi-
tion of this duty quite 75 per cent, of the
imported serological preparations used in
this country came from the United States,
the remainder from the U.K. The retail
prices charged for the more commonly-used
American products, such as the anti-
streptococcic, anti-stapliylococcic and anti-
pneumococcic sera, were always high,
and sometimes prohibitive where the aver-
age doctor and his patients were concerned.
When the present duty was imposed in the
interests of the then struggling Federal
Serum Institute at Royal Park, in Mel-
bourne, two or three Yankee firms owned a
virtual monopoly of the Australian market,
and they were a hard combination for the
Institute to compete with. There have never
been any complaints regarding the quality
of the local stuff; in many instances it is
better than the imported, since it is made
from pathogenic organisms originating in
the environment where they are used. It
is simply nonsense to talk about ‘.‘poor peop’e
having to carry the extra burden” when an
article just as good, if not better, is available
at a greatly reduced price. The duty has
resulted in American vaccines and anti-
toxins being increased in price by only a
fifth, which makes little difference in the
case of wealthy patients, but few specialists
and general practitioners will be found pre-
scribing the imported article when the Aus-
tralian preparations are more easily obtain-
able. Finally, it is pertinent to ask whether,
in the event of Australia abolishing her 20
per cent, import duty, the United States
would remove their own protective duty on
the Australian products, which duty varies
from 25 to 35 per cent. But though it might
be a pertinent question it would be a futile
one ; for we know quite well that the U.S.
would simply laugh at the suggestion.

"Singemoine” says a last word:—
For the purposes of his point (B. 13/12/’23)
“Iford” assumes something which is not a fact,
and which I never said, namely, that all French-
men are “brought up from childhood to distrust and
detest” Germans. Such a schooling' would obviously
unfit the French to understand the German tempera-
ment, in the same way as it would unfit a man for
horsemastership if he was brought up from childhood
to distrust and detest horses. The truth is
in 1914 there was more dislike of Germany in Eng-
land than there was in France. The French were
doing with the Germans what many a man with
an eye for a horse, but no love whatever for the
noble animal, does with horses —making money out
of them. In the previous year they had sold Ger-
many goods to the value of 869 million francs; Paris,
Nice, Deauville, Trouville, etc., were crowded with
Germans, and Germans were participating in sports
with the French much more than with the British.
The same phenomenon is to be seen now. After the
war the French began trading with the Germans long
before the British (this, as a matter of fact, was one
of the most serious of the anti-French charges made
by English pacifists three years ago), and there have
been threats lately of a German-French trade agree-
ment. Also, the cables mentioned last week that the
Germans and French on the Rhine had met in a
football match. In the case of horses those who
love them most often understand them least. The
perfect dealer is uninfluenced in his estimates of a
yearling's points by recollections of his gains or
losses over the youngster’s sire or dam; and the
average Frenchman viewed Germany in much the
same impersonal fashion until the late war, and is
beginning apparently to do it again. That is why,
I contend, the French understand the Germans —as
the outcome not of blind hatred but of intelligent
study.

“Caveman” is vexed with doubts :
I camp near a large school, housing about 300
children. A great many of the youngsters remain
at school at mid-day for lunch, and their parents
use various means of climbing over the lunch diffi-
culty. Three shops flourish in the vicinity, all
supplying- the kiddies’ hankerings. I have got over
my surprise at the popularity of the plebeian pie,
and am accustomed to the sight of dazzling displays
of sweets and cakes. The chief demand seems to ne
for cakes and “sweets,” with a little fruit. What
disturbs me is the reflection that mothers think so
little of their offspring as to give even the youngest
of them pennies to buy their, own lunches. Sweets
are always in circulation, ginger-beer and the other
bottled fluids are standing dishes, and lately ice-
cream has opened with a brisk demand. Milk is
not stocked at all. I have never noticed a health
or food inspector about these places. One shop, I
know, has seen no inspector of any sort for two
years. No investigation as to the suitability of the
edibles is ever made by anybody. Yet some of the
few sensible parents are still puzzled as to the
source of the ailments which afflict the children.
Some good might be done if the great Medical Con-
gress were to re-assemble and make a tour of the
city schools at lunch-time. Then perhaps somebody
would see that milk was available, that fruit' was
stocked in good quantity and quality, and that pastry,
sweets and bottled drinks were put out of sight.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Money in Australia is as tight as a pro-
hibition city at a week-end. A vast amount
is always locked up by Governments which
have just raised loans, and an immense
amount is always being sat upon by Govern-
ments which are saving up for the half-
year’s interest on loans. Also every State
has, or just had, or is just going to have a
5-£ per cent, loan on the market, free of
State and Federal income-tax ; in fact, N.S.W.
not only goes on the market in its own
capacity, but borrows under two pen-names
—the Savings Bank and the Rural Bank.
All hands have undertaken not to raise any
more tax-free loans after Dec. 31; but no-
body seriously believes that an excuse won t
be found for offering some extra inducement
—free lunches, or perhaps a prize in.a great
land distribution. Actually, the investor
could do a shade better in the open market
than by taking even the new 51 p.c. tax-
free loan on offer by the N.S.W. Govern-
ment ; so the chances of the States getting ;
local money at 5| p.c. without .the tax-free
bait are colder than the oldest icicle on the 1
South Pole.
At the recent British elections the main j
issue was the fiscal one, and, as between the
two old parties, Protection got the verdict.
But Labor took votes from both Tories and
Liberals with a platform which featured
chiefly the capital levy. Now Labor, which
didn’t get a mandate to do anything, pro-
poses to coalesce with Liberalism and, by '
abandoning the Singapore base scheme, <
make an end of Britain’s historical policy 1
of maintaining power in the Indian Ocean. <
This vast issue was never put to the elec- ]
tors, but is the kind of thing that is always ]
liable to happen under Party Government -
—just as in a completely insane community ;
it might be regarded as reasonable that a .
■ >n being commissioned to repair a
cistera, saould collaborate with the cook in
smashing the household furniture.
Fc r tje four months July-October Aus-
tralis \° exports were £18,285,95.7 short of
sullic 'nt to pay for its imports; and the
four months’ foreign interest bill, being
who’ h unprovided for, was, of course,
chai ge£ up to posterity in one shape or
anolhei Local employment was very slack
as GVi, tmas approached, for man can’t
make n's boots and import them too, and
money grt? 7 scarce that the banks looked
askance if an oiu °ustomer wanted to borrow
£lOOO on £lo,boo -'rth of security. And
while things were thus, a rather well-known
Freetrader or pterodactyl wrote to Sydney
Telegkaph :
I wonder does it ever occur to your readers that
our policy of Protection is at the root of the
trouble. Ships have been taking- away our merchan-
dise, and bringing back as little as possible in
the vain hope of becoming rich by disposing of our
goods for credits in London which we will not use.
....In the universal scheme of things under freedom
of trade, factories would spring up strong and
vigorous... .
Imports, £45,000,000; exports (to pay for
them), £27,000,000; and the popular ptero-
dactyl isn’t satisfied, and thinks we ought
to buy more! Possibly no animal ever be-
comes quite extinct.
In the dying hours of the session the Vic.
Parliament made women eligible for member-
ship. The measure came on in the early
morning, and was introduced by Prender-
gast with the remark that “if women can
get electors to vote for them, I don’t see
why they should not be given the right to
stand as candidates.” As a full majority
was required to pass the bill there were
PUTTING OUT THE CAT.
“The Lawson Government has gone into recess after a session of purely formal legislation. The
Redistribution of Seats Bill, the Gas Bill and the Factories Act have all been shelved.”
LAWSON ( with a yawn) : “Out you go, puss—my slumbers must not be disturbed!”
anxious looks at the doors when the bells
rang for the division on the second reading.
Then uncertainty developed regarding Weav-
er’s vote, but the wavering Cocky was per-
suaded to be one of the necessary 33. Those
most anxious to see the petticoat in Parlia-
ment were bachelors. At their head was
Barnes, late Minister of Railways, who had
long taken up a gallant stand on the ques-
tion.
In the by-election for Forrest, the late Peter
O’Loghlen’s seat, the Westralian A.L.P.
executive established an interesting precedent
by providing each of the three Labor candi-
dates (there were no others) with his de-
posit and a few pounds for expenses, and
letting the electors choose the one they
wanted. This proved to be J. B. Holman,
secretary of the Timber-workers’ Union,
M.L.A. for Murchison 1901-21, and con-
queror in a recent libel action against a
Sunday paper, which had accused him of
being a Communist, and therefore “up to his
neck in the German conspiracy against
Britain.” The Westralian A.L.P.’s experi-
ment is worth repeating, even if one of the
trio did lose the executive’s deposit. Copied
in N. S. Wales it would do away with a
world of hanky-panky.
It took an all-night sitting of Vic. Assem-
bly to get the P'olice Pensions Bill put
through. Labor secured a few insignificant
amendments, but the main provisions stand.
Unquestionably the measure is a much more
liberal one than w T as ever contemplated be-
fore the strike, and to the extent that they
are responsible the 636 J. Hops who went
out may consider themselves martyrs.
The Chief Justice and Gavan Duffy, J.,
dissenting, the High Court has decided that
bank clerks can have an “industrial” dis-
pute within the meaning of the Constitution.
The Convention which framed the law T would
probably say that the majority has got its
intention —that it never meant that a man
must have corns on his hands to be a
worker. In those days there wasn't as much
talk of “class consciousness” as there is
now, and the Labor party made a much
wider appeal. But. of course, the Conven-
tion never expected that the Federal law
would be used as it is, and that disputes
extending beyond one State, would be deli-
berately manufactured in order that work-
men might have a chance of getting a rise
from an Arbitration Judge.
While the Fuller Government w r as shoving
a Liquor Bill through N. S. Wales Assem-
bly last week, Stopford, the Queensland
Home Secretary, published the result of the
prohibition referendum in his State—222,Bo6
for Continuance, 136.075 for Prohibition, and
16,622 for State management. This ought to
have inspired even the Ma State’s Lowest
House with the courage to deciare that,
since there is not the slightest chance of
getting any Australian community to accept
compulsory abstinence for many years, all
prohibition polls would stand adjourned in-
definitely. Instead, it was decided to waste
£60,000 on a referendum'in September, 1928,
a date which satisfies neither the rabid Dry,
who wants a poll next year, nor the Digger
who grows wine grapes, and who asks for
some security from the Government which
encouraged him to start. A suggestion was
made during the debate that bars should
open at 8 a.m. and close at 8 p.m., instead
of the stupid 6-to-0 arrangement. But the
House was in no mood for adopting a sen-
sible little reform like that.
Lazzarini, told a Sydney Domain
crowd the other day that it was the Inten-
tion of the Labor party at the next Federal
election to make the issue “Is Australia
necessarily at war when war is declared by
Great Britain?" But Australia needn’t
fight now. It need not have fought in
the Great War. It could just have folded
its arms, said “We are not in this” —and
waited for the German cruisers to throw in
a few shells prior to taking possession. Bel-
gium thought it was neutral, too. But that
didn’t save it, any more than Lazzarini’s
idea is going to save Australia.
It is announced that the time for receiv-
ing claims against German subjects has
been extended, which is more beautiful than
useful. The Hun, by instructions from his
Government, is paying authenticated claims,
but in his own way. Thus he recently ten-
dered, in settlement of a liability of £50,000,
a pile of paper actually worth about Id.
Some authorities reckon that Germany has
made £50,000,000, and some reckon the
amount at hundreds of millions, by trading
off its paper marks. Foreign speculators
bought for a recovery, but there was none:
the new autocrats of Ilundom saw to that.
There were no morals in the operation,
of course, but it was the finest bit of busi-
ness, robbery, etc., the world ever saw.
Adelaide has just had another illustration
of what a tricky machine the referendum is
in careless hands. The Corporation proposed
to widen North-terrace by cutting about
11 feet off the lawn and garden on the
north side, and a howl of protest went up.
It proposed to borrow £20,000 for the pur-
pose, and £OO,OOO for other purposes;
and it took a vote to authorise the
loans in one lump—although, by the way, it
was begged to separate the £20,000 item
from the rest. Most ratepayers stayed
away from the poll, but the few who
voted turned down all the loans enthusiasti-
cally. Now the Council says it can still go
on with North-terrace alterations, provided
it pays for them out of revenue; it argues
that all the ratepayers opposed was a loan.
Yet without any doubt whatever it wasn’t
the borrowing but the job the money was to
be spent on which sent the majority of oppo-
sitionists to the poll.
British Labor-leader Ramsay Macdonald
can hardly be said to be in sight of office,
as he has only about 190 followers in the
Commons, but he is said to be already
troubled by the difficulty of “placating the
superabundant claimants for office.” Yet
there is a surprising lot of office in the Cold
Country. Before the war led to the creation
of extra portfolios Asquith had 56 men in
his Ministry, though British Ministers aren’t
all in the Cabinet. If Ramsay Macdonald
has 57 applications already his troubles have
commenced early.
Vic. Premier Lawson claims to have pro-
vided Baldwin with a precedent for his deci
sion to take his dismissal —if dismissal it
is to be—from Parliament. Lawson first
sang a swan song after the general election
in August, 1921, but realising the possibility
of a split in the Cocky party he hung on.
And, as a result of dropping some of his
colleagues and substituting others, he hangs
on still. When the decision of the electors
is confusing it is the sensible thing to leave
it to the House.
If it is true, as one of its members has
announced, that the Federal Labor party is
going to fight the next election on the cry of
“independence of the Empire’s wars,” then the
party is going to do something very foolish.
A prime consideration with every party
under our system of government is votes,
and Labor already has all those that are
to be got from the anti-British ticket.
Andrew Fisher —or, rather, the brains of the
Fisher party—realised this, and when he laid
himself out to get the other votes the reward
w r as office.
Australia has heard a lot of him lately—
the globe-trotter who comes back lamenting
because there is so little news from this side
in the British press, and asking that a
remedy be found somehow. But there really
is quite a lot published about this country.
Papers like the Financial News, Finan-
cial Times, Financier, etc., are pretty re-
gular with their articles about Australian
extravagance. Theodore, of Queensland, has
probably had more space in the British press
than any other mere local or subordinate
Premier in the Empire. If we want to get
other sorts of news, then we must provide
it. But the opening of a steel high roaa
across the continent is indefinitely postponed.
No new State or State capital is emerging.
It is a long time since any Government has
risen with a startling new policy, save that
of putting people on the land with loan
money, and that is flat and old. The coun-
try is short of brigands and insurrections,
and it only creates a new bishopric now and
then. It hasn’t even discussed a land-grant
railway since about 1883. In fact, it is
hard to think of anything here, bar mone-
tary troubles, that would appeal much to the
yellow press; and most press is yellow these
days.
THE UNSPEAKABLES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Members of the N. S. Wales Assembly moved to
have Mr. McGiir’s speech expunged from Hansard,
but this was held to be impracticable.”
They once had notoriety, but now they’re out of
date,
The phrases fishwives hurled about in bad old Bil-
lingsgate.
The taunts that fell from Limehouse tongues when
angry passions stirred
Enriched our modern language with a badly needed
word.
The turf has had its Chesterfields; and lurid tongues
run free
When seamen quaff their amber beer, fresh from the
purple sea.
But the words they use are mere circumlocutions,
Their charges milk-and-watery dilutions,
Innocuous and mild
Beside indictments filed
When gentlemen are riled
In the Mother (as it’s styled)
Of Australian Parliamentary institutions.
Unpleasant imputations may be heard in navvies'
camps,
Or bellowed into fo’c’s’les by second mates of tramps.
Some items such as tongues polite would tremble to
rehearse
The listener may glimpse at in a full-power Irish
curse;
And once I ‘saw a curate wince as if his marrow'd
freeze
At certain crude amenities exchanged between bargees.
But they’re trivial and sapless contributions
To the human mouth’s defilements and pollutions
Compared with those disbursed
By lawmakers aspersed,
And resolved to spit their worst,
. In the oldest and the first
Of. Australian Parliamentary institutions.
There are insults, deadly insults, for which nothing
can atone,
No amende and no withdrawal; they’re erased in
blood alone.
But ’tis in a social stratum like the ’Loo or Surry
Hills,
Not where the electors’ chosen sit together over
bills.
Never fear the vilest insult, foulest stigma, filthiest
slur
Davidson will lash to frenzy, or to combat force
McGirr ;
Their tongues will wag away without ablutions,
Their self-esteem sustain no diminutions,
Where their cesspit gibes are framed
They’ll continue unashamed,
Defaming and defamed
In the Mother (as it’s named)
Of Australian Parliamentary institutions.

The Queensland Insurance pulled through a
difficult year very successfully: it gave share-
holders their usual 12* p.e. divs. and had
left for reserves another 7* p.e. on capital.
But not all of the £38,052 of surplus on hand
after paying divs. can be regarded as profit
earned, because underwriting turnover was
bigger, and £lO,OOO of the surplus was re-
quired to increase the reserve of unearned
premiums to an amount sufficient to re-insure
risks outstanding at the balancing date.
Profit-earning has not been nearly so easy
lately as it was in years of brisk trading and
war prices. The surplus for 1920 was nearly
a third as large again as that for the past
12 months, though by energetic business-
seeking net premium income was a record:
at £462,607 it was £22,586 larger than the
previous best, despite the slackening of
values and restricted mercantile activity.
This expansion of premium income was the
more creditable because it was obtained at
the cost of only a very small increase in the
loss rate. The expense rate had about the
same movement. These cumulative move-
ments tell, however. The surplus of premium
income over claims and all costs was but
£49,781, compared with almost £llO,OOO in
1920. Interest earnings, however, contributed
£50,771 against £41,652 three years ago.

The feature of the comparisons is that the
claims rate is still considerably less than
the pre-war experience, but that expenses are
much higher. To some extent one factor is in-
fluenced by the other. The co. is showing
smaller margins of profit than 10 years ago,
but on larger volumes of business they give
better aggregate results for shareholders.
The death of shipping-man James Burns
four months ago recalled that it was in his
office at Townsville (N.Q.) 38 years ago,
when the Burns-Philp fleet was in its in-
fancy, that the Queensland Insurance Co.
was established as a side-line to the shipping
business. Later both concerns shifted their
headquarters to Sydney, and the insurance
co. nowadays has world-wide interests. It
is not a big office by comparison with some
of its British and American competitors, but
if is solid. Its £84(5,000-odd of funds (capi-
tal and reserves) are equal to 183 p.e. on
last year’s net premium income, and are
one-fifth larger than standard size. They
are sufficient, to meet claims almost four
times last year’s losses. How funds are
invested is shown by the next table, which
also discloses how the management has put
surpluses into public securities since 1914:

The old Queensland Insurance shareholder
is nowadays receiving fat returns on his
investment. The introductory table goes back
to the first issue of bonus shares. In nine
years paid capital was increased from
£75,000 to a half-million wholly by reserve
transfers, and the p.c. divs. now give
83i p.c. p.a. on the original investment.
Every £1 put into the co. by the old share-
holder has the backing of assets worth
£8 16s. after laying aside sufficient to re-
insure unexpired risks as at September 30.

When the Co-operative started writing busi-
ness just a dozen years ago it proposed to
go in for “improved Industrial assurance.”
But it found that, in restricted quantities,
there was not much in that business, and when
in August last one of the newer cos., the Com-
monwealth General Assurance Gorp., offered
to take all Industrial policies off its hands
the Co-op. directors readily agreed to part
with them. The terms, the directors announced,
were “quite satisfactory to both parties”;
but they must have heaved a sigh of relief
when the purchaser accepted all responsibility
for policy-liabilities, and they probably gave
three cheers when they received £lO,OOO cash
for business which had thus far been run
at a loss. At the end of July there were
7563 policies in force assuring £242,080,
and the actuarial liability was estimated at
£24,500. The precise effect of the sale is
not visible in the Co-operative’s accounts as
at September 30; but for a start it per-
mitted the management to reduce the pro-
vision for outstanding policies as at
September, 1922, from £69,410 to £50,241,
and the “foundation, organisation and
extension of business” account, which
carried portion of the cost of establishing
the branch and also the deficits, was cut
from £58,180 to £40,000. If the £66,279
of assurance funds at September 30 cover
the actuarial liability under Ordinary poli-
cies, then shareholders can congratulate
themselves on having £lB,OOO or so of their
capital restored in tangible form. Similarly
Ordinary policy-holders can count on that
amount as additional backing to their con-
tracts.
The actual position of the Co-operative
is not clear; everything depends on the
exact amount which actuary Bremner re-
quires for policy-obligations. Hitherto valua-
tions have been made quinquenninlly, and
the next is not due until 1926. Now that
the Industrial branch has been closed the
directors should consider whether it is not
desirable to get a statement of policy liabili-
ties at an early date. They would then
learn precisely how the business stands, and
in the existing highly unsatisfactory state
of assurance affairs, for which the numer-
ous young spendthrift offices are responsible,
an actuary’s certificate might help new-busi-
ness writing. Incidentally, shareholders
would have a better idea as to how they
stand in the enterprise. So far they have
had no div. whatever; instead, until the
sale of the Industrial branch recouped some
of the outlay, their capital had been gradu-
ally bitten into to develop the business, and
to provide the necessary support for policy
contracts. As to the future, the latest
accounts give little guidance, because the
year’s Industrial operations figure therein,
and expenses in all branches other than
Accident are in one entry. They tell this
much : to win £32,959 of Ordinary premiums
and £12,466 of Industrial—a total of £45,425
—no less than £35,400 was spent, giving
an expense rate of 78 p.c. Under the cir-
cumstances, further examinations of the Co-
operative’s affairs are postponed until the
next accounts reveal the basis on which Ordi-
nary business is being conducted. Mean-
while, the policy-holder is given ample pro-
tection. Even assuming that the £66,279
of funds are less than the actuary might de-
mand, there is now £51,000 or so of share-
holders’ capital intact as additional support.
In Government securities and cash the co.
holds £91,651; there are loans on policies
and mortgages for £14,433; freeholds with
a book value of £7626; and tangible odds-
and-ends for £7OOO or so more. With rea-
sonable luck and a continuance of sound
management, the Co-operative still has a
chance of developing into a sound life-
underwriter which may in a few years pay
moderate divs. and bonuses. Shareholders
have had a long wait, and the experience of
the Co-operative, which got into the business
when costs were much lower than they now
are, and which has had sound actuarial
guidance and reasonably good management
from the beginning, indicates plainly what
shareholders in some of the newer offices can
expect when their capital is exhausted and
somebody insists on an investigation into
their affairs. Several of them, run by reck-
less, self-appointed “governing-directors,”
are rapidly qualifying for the morgue and a
verdict of suicide.

The latest are the Mosgiel’s jubilee accounts,
and Dunedin is so well satisfied with the
co.’s position that a little of the war-time
accumulations of surplus profits is being
taken to pay up 30s. on the £5 shares called
to £3 10s. This is the only gift issue ever
made to shareholders, and is the result of
the very conservative way in which the cp.
was nursed when war conditions gave the
mill unprecedented opportunities. In the
10 years to 1913 divs. averaged only 5 p.c.
p.a. and visible reserves declined a few hun-
dreds ; since 1913, though divs. have averaged
9-J p.c., £33,251 has been visibly laid aside.
Capital remained stationary at £83,457
throughout the 20 years. The expansion of
the business since the war began is shown
by the following table: —

Actual profits have been much better than
indicated bv the statement of divs. and re-
serve additions given by the introductory
table, because throughout the good years the
management wrote down severely the book
values of plant. The comparisons of balance-
sheet figures which follow disclose that fixed
assets at the latest balance were valued at
nearly £29,000 less than in 1910, though
meanwhile almost £60,000 had been spent on
new machinery and plant:—

The curtailment of book values has obvi-
ously been much more than actual deprecia-
tion demanded, and in this way the
have put the enterprise on very solid founda-
tions. It also means that on total funds in
the business the return to shareholders is
really small. An examination of the liquid
position gives another view of how share-
holders’ investment has improved. In 1910
the surplus of stocks and book debts over and
above all outside liabilities was £36.169.
At the latest balance the liquid surplus,
which included £34,655 of gilt-edged securi-
ties, was £99,649. Thus after payment of
final divs. practically the whole of the paid
capital (including bonus additions) was re-
presented by liquid assets. The properties,
buildings, machinery and plant can, there-
fore, be regarded as additional to the 205.-
in-the-£ security. There are very few indus-
trial enterprises in the Commonwalth and
Dominion which are so snug.

Mt. Lyell is on the lists as a copper mining
co., and its reports talk mostly copper; but
when considering profits and the general
financial position the following interests
must not be overlooked:—
Chemical Works, Yarraville and Fremantle
(book value) . . . . . . . . £397,962
Shares in Wallaroo-Mt. Lyell Fertilisers,
Ltd .. . . .. 102,150
Electrolytic Zinc (deferred ordinaries) . . 214,265
Metal Manufactures, Ltd., 25,000 £1 paid
ordinaries; 53,727 10 p.c. £1 paid
prefs. ; and 26,242 prefs. paid to 12s. 6d. 95,127
Lake Margaret Hydro-Electric scheme . . 98,022
The book values of those more or less asso-
ciated enterprises exceed £900,000, repre-
senting an amount equal to two-thirds of
paid capital. The chemical and fertiliser
businesses and the copper-manufacturing in-
dustry at Port Ivembla are all turning in
profits. How much is not disclosed, because
all income is grouped in one entry in the
accounts, and it is quite impossible for the
outsider to ascertain what mining and smelt-
ing earnings amounted to, or how much
flowed from other sources. It is quite cer-
tain, however, that with electrolytic copper
at an average of £73 12s. for the 12 months
to September 30, the Lyell mines were work-
ing on very narrow margins. The directors
admit that when the market fell to £63 no
profit whatever could be earned under exist-
ing working conditions. The accounts made
up as at September 30 last show £151,003
profit for the year; in the introductory table
the amounts provided for depreciation
(£50,712) and spent on prospecting (£4120)
are also included and shown separately as
written-off. That procedure is adopted be-
cause generally the size of those appropria-
tions has depended on the extent of earnings,
and their inclusion gives a better idea of
how profits have behaved than would be
the case if only the net earnings disclosed
by the directors were recorded. The profits
in the table also include £31,296, the extent
to which general reserves expanded during
the period. It is improbable that any of
the depreciation allowances found their way ■
intp this reserve; probably much of the
addition was the profit earned by selling
50,000 8 p.c. Electrolytic Zinc prefs. and
3750 deferred ordinaries in the market. Any-
way, no analysis of profits which is enlight-
ening can be made by the outsider. All that
can be ascertained for sure is that from its
varied interests Lyell last year made enough
to pay 10 p.c. and then visibly laid aside
£37,800.
A better view of performances for three
years is given by an examination of the
liquid position

No divs. were paid in the 1921 and 1922 finan-
cial periods, and in the two years the liquid
surplus expanded £120,810. During the past
12 months £82,451 more was added after dis-
tributing £128.919 among shareholders. They
are cheering figures which do not take into
account the expansion of sideline interests
and the increase of holdings in other enter-
prises, and they have been achieved during
a period when heavy expenditure was in-
curred in entirely reorganising the Queens-
town treatment and smelting practice. The
surplus of cash, stocks and book debts over
and above all outside liabilities at Septem-
ber 30 represented 11s. 6d. per fully-paid
£1 share. In addition, there were the shares
in other cos. and the subsidiary enterprises,
some of them well established on a very
profitable basis, and others, like the Elec-
trolytic Zinc deferreds (which do not rank
for divs. until July 31, 1925) and Lake
Margaret hydro-electric scheme (the Tas.
Government has contracted to take up to
3000-h.p. per annum), have bright prospects.
Provided the copper market remains high
enough to maintain mining and smelting
operations on at least a self-supporting basis
—that is to say, so long as copper activities
don’t cut into liquid resources —the Lyell co.
is in a very snug position. Too much reliance
should not be placed on the future of the
metal market, though ; owing to the unsettled
condition of Europe copper is not in brisk
demand, and U.S.A. mines seem to be able
to continue to keep the market fully sup-
plied at low prices and pay their way. Now
that Lyell has reorganised its works and
can increase its output, a rise of a few
pounds in the metal would make a big dif-
ference to it, especially as the basic wage
recently rose from an average of 60s. sd. per
week for the past year to 745. 5d., and is
eating up much of the savings effected in
treatment processes.
The old Lyell mine is now quite a
back-number. Until a few years ago it
supplied large tonnages of pyritic ore for
blending with silicious material from the
North Lyell in smelting. Nowadays the
North ore is subjected to preliminary treat-
ment by concentration and flotation to re-
move silica contents. Last year only 24.245
tons were hauled from the Lyell, and 9246
tons were put through the smelters, the
balance going to chemical works for sul-

put was 109,182 tons, of which 5993 tons
going 12| p.c. copper, 2tjOz. silver and
0.0490 z. gold went direct to the converters.
The concentrators handled 103,439 tons aver-
aging 5.90 p.c. copper, 1.050 z. silver and
0.0140 z. gold, reducing the bulk to 32,251
tons concentrates, capturing 92.17 p.c. of
the copper, 86.76 p.c. of the silver, and
78.34 p.c. of the gold contents. This plant

The output of blister was smaller owing to
the hold-up of treatment while finalising
plant-reconstruction, but the difference in
output was more than counterbalanced by
the copper lying in concentrates at the close
of the financial year. Here are production

The output of North Lyell ore last year
averaged S4OO tons per four weeks, but gen-
eral-manager R. M. Murray hopes to in-
crease it to 10,000 tons per month, and, if
labor is available, lie may lift output to
12,000 tons.
In recent years development work has
been on a very restricted scale; nevertheless,
a fresh measuring-up gives North Lyell more
than a million tons going 6 p.c. copper, TJoz.
silver and 0.0150 z. gold per ton. Mt. Lyell
has known reserves of 1,647,122 tons averag-
ing 4 p.c. copper, 14oz. silver and 0.040 z.
gold, but excepting that about 1000 tons per
month is needed for blending in the furnaces
and that there is a problematic demand for
its pyritic ore for sulphuric-acid making, the
old mine is for the time being on the shelf.

With tin about £240 at three months, the
position of the Ardlethan and other reefing
shows in N. S. Wales is deplorable. It is
years since their scrip was so low in the
market, and their unhappy state is reflected
in their paltry output. The annual meeting
of the Carpathia usually consists of a series
of wails about the rapacity of the unions and
the iniquity of a tin market below £200: but
now that the going is good and no excuses
can be made performances are still wretched.
The show has lately been in trouble with the
behavior of its deposit, and appealed to
the Mines Department for geological guid-
ance. The cos.’s best run was for the half-
year to July, 1920, when manager Jim
Hardman turned out 139 tons concentrates
which fetched £23,855. Since then produc-
tion has dwindled to vanishing-point. There
are now only about 70 men employed on the
Ardlethan field, or one-tenth of the number
a few years ago.
* * * *
Several small syndicates have been develop-
ing a quartz reef on Mt. Piper, or Billapa-
loola tableland, about 20 miles east from
Tumut (N.S.W.). The reef is a true fissure
in granite, with a general north and south
strike, and has been located at intervals over
a length of about one mile. At the northern,
or Mt. Piper, end a shaft has been sunk 50ft.
in decomposed granite; values over a width
of 24ft. varied from 4dwt. to 30z.. and the
dump assayed 14oz. About 20 chains north
from the shaft is the Mt. Piper tunnel,
driven 80ft. into the hill; the reef there is
particularly strong, averaging 2ft. wide,
values ranging from Idwt. to 16dwt. The
various shows seem to have been marking
time in the hope of one property being-
floated, so that they could get reflected pub-
licity. Mining-engineer A. P. Penman has
inspected the finds, and he considers that one
central organisation should control the lot,
especially because a continual averaging of
values will be necessary in milling, and
that requires numerous faces. Mr. Penman
considers that with an amalgamation of
interests the field is decidedly promising and
worth development; and an effort is now
being made to consolidate the shows and float
a development co., which will restrict its
operations to ascertaining quantities and
values before contemplating extensive plant
purchases.
* * * #
A well-known Victorian mining-man who
recently visited the Crown, at Bombandy
Mountain (N.S.W.), tips the southern tun-
nel to cut “C” reef about 130 ft. beyond the
previous estimate. He also condemns the
north tunnel as being a fool’s chase after
something indefinite in broken country. This
view supports that of E. P. Johnson, the
first consulting-engineer of the co. WFen
E.P. resigned and left the Board to make
room for A. Vickery, the change in the
bowling proved disadvantageous to the co.
Hi: never believed in the north tunnel, which
Hansen, of Ajax North (Vic.), fathered,
and it has been discontinued at 118 ft. after
having cost £lO per foot. If deeper develop-
ments are good, however, the abandoned tun-
nel may be re-commissioned and connected
with other workings as a battery-feeder.
* * * *
Manager James Negus is still developing
the Junction Reefs, Mandurama (N.S.W.),
for the Mt. Boppy Co. Work is progressing
satisfactorily; values have come up to expec-
tations in one section, but sampling in the
north-east portion has not been so good.
The 12-months’ working option will expire
in May, and the developmental programme
will probably be completed about the end
of February. By that time sinking and
rising through all the ore-beds west of the
main dyke should decide whether Boppy will
exercise its option.
* * * #
In gold-mining nothing bucks the market
like a new development, however indefinite
the find may be. South Lucknow (N.S.W.)
had 43,000 forfeited shares on its hands
when the crosscut tapped some quartz and
calcite carrying arsenical pyrites and a little
geld. So great was the rush to redeem the
forfeitable paper that secretary Spooner
withdrew the auctioneer’s brief. One tan-
gible result should be the escape of contri-
buting holders from a January call. An-
other 3d. will make the contribs. paid to 25.,
and the co. will then have the call on
200,000 shares up to 3s. 6d.
Over-credulous folk slipped badly over the
Big Ben, at Gundagai (N.S.W.). Appa-
rently there was never anything in the show
to justify the loud boosts by interested
parties. It has been another instance in
which a report by a trustworthy mining-
engineer would have saved thousands. The
show is now in the hands of a tribute party.
A small co. has been formed to give the
old Yuanmi mine (W.A.) another trial. The
show contains some big ore bodies, and was
for years a London-managed concern; but
refractory ore at depth and high costs set-
tled it. Yuanmi costs were under 20s. a
ton when oxidised ore was being mined, but
ran up to 70s. in the sulphide zone. Lon-
don management adopted a roasting process:
the new co. proposes concentration and
will roast concentrates only.
Adelaide is trying very hard to arouse
interest in the Orinda (W.A.). Gold is
claimed to have Jieen exposed in costeens
and intermediate drives, dumps of ore on
the surface are estimated to be worth ounces,
and word is being passed around that the
shares will have a good rise shortly. Pre-
vious option-holders are believed to have
abandoned the show on account of the short-
ness of its shoot.
* * * *
Lanarkshire C’o. has taken a sampling'
option on a show in the West which is said
to be “not far from the old Golden Pole,”
and “as good as Edna May.” Lanarkshire
was one of the many sliilling-on-application
and shilling-on-allotment cos. which sprang
up in Adelaide at the beginning of the Hamp-
ton boom, and wilted when the slump came.
It has taken and abandoned one or two
options since, but want of funds has pre-
vented anything big being acquired. On
this occasion a 6d. call has been guaran-
teed, so that someone has evidently been
given the tip that the co.’s latest spec, has
values good enough for a market flutter.

For the year to September 30 Tongkah
Harbor’s four operating dredges all made
profits. No. 2 plant was kept high and dry.
No. 3 dipped into the shore side of Pnket
Sound, while No. 6 kept in deep water.
Despite the low price of tin during most of
the period, these plants worked ground that
panned out at 64d. in the shallow strip and
74d. in the deep water. As No. 6 had to cut
back through old tails, the far-out wash must
have been fairly good stuff. The other two
plants have been running over the Bang Tao
ground. No. 5 put up a record of a
yd. for 735,400 yd. No. 4 averaged s|d.
Results compare as follows:
1921. 1922. 1923.
Dredged (c. yd.) . . 3,319,480 3,167,580 3,147,300

Value of output. . £97,497 £95,762 £99.654
Average price oxide
per ton . .£lll 12s. £92 17s. Bd. £lll 9s. sd.
Costs were 4.764 d. a yd. against 5.889 d. in
the previous year, and totalled £62,469.
Other charges and royalty mopped up
£17,098, so £20,086 remained to provide a
2s. div. (£35,000) and write down plant, etc.
The balance-sheet showed debts of only
£6531; cash in hand totted up £38,500. Be-
sides. tin stocks and sundry debtors totalling
£5200 were as good as a bank account. The
way writing-down was done in good times
has been an object-lesson. Five dredges
stand in the books at £17,150, or about what
it costs nowadays to ship a new plant out
of Melbourne and get it under steam. The
Puket Sound property, which appears at
£lOO,OOO, has yielded nearly 16,000 tons tin
worth £1,750,000 and paid more than 80s. a
share on 150,000 £1 shares. Out. of the
Bang Tao, a £21,500 investment, £49,200 of
profit was won last year. Altogether the
co. has piled up 16,134 tons oxide worth
£1,917,575. Though that is miles short of
the original IXL talk of £20,000,000, share-
holders have had £630,000 of divs. Wanting
fresh fields to plough, 10,000 acres at Tapah
(F.M.S.) are being tested, and also 1000
acres more in East Siam.
* * * *
Bundi Tin, an offshoot of the Malaya
Corp. in Trengganu (F.M.S.), should have
its dredge at work in July next. George
Poole, dredgemaster, has let a contract for
a year’s supply of wood-fuel costing £9OOO
so that there may be no interruption when
once things are started. W. B. Waring,
who bored the area, states that 10 acres at
the head of Bundi Valley should average
310 z., and 400 acres in the Bundi and
Cheney Valleys 260 z. Depth of ground is
given as 24ft. and the tin-dirt between 15
and 16 million yards. At 100,000 yards a
month there should be a life of 13 years be-
fore the 85,000 shares, which will be the
full register when the 5000 reserves are
issued shortly. There is a glitter about the
estimates should tin remain around £240, as
£3OOO a month is the estimated profit with
the metal at £l6O. But boring charts have
developed such a habit of going wrong that
doubting Thomases are on the increase.
George Poole, however, has plenty of back-
ers, and he has never fathered a dud yet.
* * * •
Teddy Miles’s Deebook pays good fees and
refunds capital in sixpenny instalments. One
of its dredges went on to the Ronpibon Ex-
tended area in return for 15,000 paids. Last
year this plant handled 770.000 c. yd., aver-
aging 13oz. oxide. All-in costs were
£75 4s. lOd. a ton, or nearly £l4 less than
in the two previous years. Profit was
£34 14s. a ton for 283 tons, which brought in
a tidy div. of £2500 for Deebook and fur-
nished funds to give the dredge a big over-
haul. The other Deebook plant went to the
Taiping, which is paying off the £9300 it
owes as fast as the tin market permits.
The Siamese Tin Syndicate, which sold
the Ratrut Co. an area that was claimed to
go 150 z., but worked out at only 70z., and
received 30,000 fully-paid Ratrut shares, has
come to heel after lengthy negotiations. It
is taking back its ground and returning
25,000 of the shares.
* * * *
Conditions have been made a little easier
for new arrivals on Mt. Isa silver-lead field
(Q.) by a fall of rain. But there is still
a shortage of water, and a kerosene-tinful
costs 2s. 6d. Things are also mixed because
the various claims and leases have so far
not been surveyed. The Mines Department
lias promised to have a surveyor on the job
instantly, so that difficulty should be over-
come early in the New Year. Operations
will be on a restricted scale, though, until
the drought terminates. Important dis-
coveries have been made during the past
month; ore has been found over a length of,
roughly, five miles along the axial line of
folding, and that makes the future look very
rosy. The feeling on the field is strong
for larger leases, and the hard conditions
incline holders to let options to representa-
tives of Capital. So much is thought of
the field in the North that a trial railway
survey is already spoken of. Over 100 leases
have been applied for to date, and there is
still room for new-comers who are willing to
battle against difficult conditions.
* * * *
Capital is being raised to give the Mt.
Britton goldfield (N.Q.) another trial. The
field is about 60 miles west of M'ackay, and
30 years ago commanded a good deal of
attention. Dr. Jack was favorably im-
pressed, but he was on the field at the time
the Little Wanderer was crushing 4oz.
stone. The Wanderer will be first tested ; when
abandoned the reef had been pinched to a
few inches in very hard country, but the
values were there. The syndicate wants
£l2OO. and is well on its way to get it. It
proposes to spend it all on prospecting, and
if prospects are favorable a larger co. will
be formed.
* * * *
Queensland’s Mines Minister Jones has
just completed a visit of inspection to the
Bowen coalfield and Mt. Coolon goldfield. At.
the Bowen State Colliery the output of
400 tons per day has been maintained, but the
limit of the northern market has been
reached for the time being, and probably an
occasional shift will be slipped until the
demand grows. At Mt. Coolon the Minister
investigated the justification for erecting a
State battery, for which the field has been
clamoring.
* * * *
Alex. Gordon’s South Australian Oilwells
Co. still gives itself a good chance of bag-
ging the Commonwealth Government’s petro-
leum reward. In its No. 1 Caroline bore,
near Nelson (Vic.), oil indications have been
got in a porous bed well down the syncline,
and this is claimed to “speak highly for the
likelihood of more oil on the crest of the
fold.” The Calyx plant is being shifted to a
site on the crest of the anticline, and probing
is to continue until a favorable site is located
for a big hole. A find of bitumen and engi-
neer 11. S. Dyne’s belief that the geological
structure is favorable have put heart in
Alex. Gordon’s crowd, and they have pegged
a big area.
Costerfield (Vic.) gold-antimony mine has
its new treatment-plant going. The first
tapping was 6 tons of high-grade star anti-
mony, got from run-of-the-mine product. The
next job is to get cash to convert the pigment
resources of the mine into paint. That job
is to be handled by Bracenall Bros., of
Sydney.

“Winkle”: Mention of camel itch (B.
6/12/’23) reminds me of the queerest parade
our mob ever saw. It was at Ibna-a-Brak
that the loathsome disease became unbear-
able. The camels, always malodorous, hav-
ing had no attention during six weeks’
advance had become gruesome to contemplate
—red and hairless with mange—while their
riders were covered with suppurating sores
which no lotion would ease nor ointment
cure. Then to the field ambulance just be-
hind the front line came a party of high-up
medical officers from Alex, to investigate.
Their first step was to have a long line of
naked white sufferers placed in front of
another line of Gyppo awful examples. The
parade was only in its initial stages when
three Fritz ’planes arrived. At the first
bomb the cameliers fell fiat on the ground
in the approved fashion. The gaudy salute-
takers from the base, however, scuttled to
the shelter of the near-by creek-bed; and
instead of lying snug there while the Huns
passed overhead, they ran on and on, lighting
for precedence with the panic-stricken naked
siedas. That was the last we saw of them.
The parade evaporated.

“Retired Christian” sees money in it: —
Archbishop Kelly recently objected to the “attacks
made for political purposes on the Catholic Church.”
And then he got down to details: “At Bega, during
the elections, the people were advised that if they
voted for a certain candidate the Pope would come
to live in Sydney.” The context indicates that this
was regarded in Bega not as a message of hope but as
a threat. And yet it is hard to imagine a more
stupendous piece of good fortune for the South Coast
of N. S. Wales than that the Pope should transfer
the Vatican to Bega. Nothing need be said of the
rise in land values adjacent to the site selected for
the Pope’s palace, nor of the boom in the building
and allied trades that would follow upon the arrival
of his immediate entourage. And then there would
be the advt But the greatest and most enduring gain
would arise from the fact of Bega becoming the Mecca
of the Roman Catholic world. The foreign pilgrims who
visit Rome mean a harvest of hundreds of millions of
lira every year to the citizens of ltaly, and the
presence of the Vatican makes the city by the Tiber
a positive haunt of kings and queens, both R.C. and
Protestant. A Sydney weekly started a subscription-
list some years ago with the object of buying Rome
for cash and exterminating it. The idea of lurin»
the Pope to Australia strikes me as far more prac
ticable and financially attractive, and if the people
of Bega are really in a position to push the scheme
along, I submit that it is their duty to themselvef
and the Commonwealth to do it.
“Herodot”: There is at least one river
town in Western N. S. Wales where the be-
lief is strong that whoever picks the flower
of the Darling pea will not get away from
the river for seven years. In the long ago
n youth from Sydney was spending his holi-
days there, and on the day before he was
due to return to the city was a guest at a
picnic. When somebody told him about the
superstition attached to the Darling pea, he
scoffed at it, and, breaking off a piece, placed
it in his coat. Several hours biter, on the
way back to the town, the horse that he was
'riding bolted and threw him fracturing Ins
w in the local hospital he fell m love
with one of the nurses, and before 1 his period
of convalescence was up became engaged to
her. They were married as soon as he was
able to leave the hospital, and the girls
father, a prosperous stock-and-station agent,
took him into partnership. When he and
his wife paid their first visit to the city aitei
their marriage, it was recalled that it was
just on seven years from the day he had
picked the flower of the pea.
“The Bump us” :
The spread of culture !
Ten years ago 1 was
in the sheep districts
in the nor’-west of
W.A.. and worked for
a while at one station
where a cockatoo was
the pet of the house.
A favorite expression
of Mrs. Wool was
“How nice!” and
cocky had picked it
up and made it his
slogan. The other
day I was in Clare-
mont, Westralia’s
society area, and came
upon the Wool family
in a new environment.
From what I could
see of the house and
its furnishing it was
replete with all the
latest refinements of
a luxurious age. As
I stood wondering if
I could chance an-
nouncing myself as an
old friend of the
family, the same old
cockatoo stalked ma-
jestically along the
verandah-railing. He
eyed me diffidently and Remarked: “Heow
naice!” I didn’t make myself known.

“Shed Hand” : Aprojws of the discovery by
detectives of a tank containing 80 gallons
of oil buried under a bunk in a humpy near
the soap-and-vaseline “gusher” at Lake Eva
(W.A.). Some weeks before this oil swindle
was started a quantity of lubricant was
consigned from Perth to Yellowdine, which
is not many miles from the scene of opera-
tions. While the cases stood in the goods-
shed at Perth, an old porter who had seen
much service all over W.A. scratched his
head in wonderment. “He fer Yallerdme.
he rumbled. “Spare me days, there am t any

SECRET COMMISSION.
“How Boron gels people to listen to his jokes beats me.”
“Oh. that's easy. He always says, 'Boys, I’ll tell you a good ’un
and then we'll have a drink.”
“Wessel” digs back: —
From 1830 to 1875 the Bonin Islands, the seat of
Japan’s southernmost naval base, were a British colony.
It is true that of the'original five white settlers only
one was an Englishman; of the others two were
Yankees, one an Italian 'and one a Dane. But the
Italian, who was the leader of the expedition, was a
naturalised British subject, and the colony had
the support and backing- of the
British Consul at Honolulu, who
provided them with a Union Jack
to hoist. Mazarro (the Italian)
and John Millinchamp (elsewhere
called Richard Millechant) were
old hands at the Robinson Crusoe
business in a worse climate than
the Bonins. Mazarro was the
second mate and Millinchamp one
of the crew of the schooner Prince
of Wales, which went sealing to
the Crozets and was wrecked
there in 1820. They spent two
years on the island before they
were picked up by an American
vessel. '(Charles Goodridge, one of
the wrecked men, afterwards lived
for some years in Tasmania and
wrote a book about it.) Mazarro quar-
relled with the American skipper,
and he, Millinchamp and some of
the others stayed on the island of
St. Paul. In 1835 Goodridge ran
'across Mazarro in London and
Heard about what followed. Maz-
i-afro and Millinchamp, after col-
lecting a lot of sealskins' on St.
Paul, had gone trading to China
and South America ; finally, they
Uacl arrived in Honolulu, and it
was from there they started the
Bonin expedition. But all that
Mazarro told his old shipmate
about it w T as that they had colon-
ised an island near Japan and
were working it with slaves, i.e..
Kanakas, whom they took with
them from Honolulu. In later
days other white men joined the
Bonin colony, mostly either desert-
ers from whalers or sick men left
on shore by whaling vessels. It
was a mixed community, as most
of the women were Polynesians,
though there were one or two
half-caste Spaniards from Guam.
When the Japanese occupied the
islands, in 1875, the population had grown to 150.
About 7000 Japanese are now employed there.

“Queen-street”: Hidden from view by an
advertising hoarding next to Goldsbrouglns
warehouse in Bourke-street. Melbourne, is
the five-roomed residence built by Redmond
Barry in 1842. It is still well preserved aild
is used for storage of cement, etc.; but it is
doohied to early destruction to make room
for a warehouse. It was in this cottage
that Barry opened Melbourne’s first lending-
library in 1842: a spare room was fitted up
as a reading-room, and furnished with
standard works which the future Judge and
Chancellor had brought from England.
“Coma”: I was
resident surgeon at
a Melbourne hospi-
tal during the ’flu
epidemic of 1918-
19, when the casu-
alty waiting-rooms
were full of men
and fuller of women
who had, or im-
agined they had,
the insidious dis-
ease. A slightly in-
ebriated and burly
navvy, with a boil
on his knee, claimed
my attention, and,
the staff being
short-handed an and
over-worked, I dis-
pensed with help,
got him to remove
his dungarees, gave
him a whiff of
chloroform and in-
cised the offending-
part. On partially
recovering from the
anaesthetic, he ap-
parently thought he
had been gathered
in by tire blue-coats
of the law, and, re-
marking that he
“would give the
s a go for it,”
he made for the
door in a violent
tantrum and a
short shirt, a wor-
ried surgeon swing-
in g on behind.
Wrenching open
the door he hurled
himself into the
waiting-room; and
my last recollection
before collapsing is
of a mob of scan-
dalised fema 1e s’
frantically bolting
for the exit.
“Nitric” : A beauty-parlor specialist lias
been first puzzling and then amusing the
Brisbane police. The young lady disappeared
from her vocation and presently arrived at
Sand gate per rowing-boat with her hair
bobbed and the rest of her dressed in male
attire. Her story was to the effect that a

couple (unknown) had spirited her on board
a motor-boat, drugged her and then put out
to sea, and that after a week she had eluded
her captors and escaped in the launch s
boat. She professed to have been seized
while asleep on the beach at Southport, but
was' unable to describe the kidnappers, and
when any ticklish questions were fired at
her she would suddenly lose her memory.
In the end she owned up that the whole yarn
was the product of a lively imagination. It
perhaps explains everything that _ the lady
was a budding moving-picture artist before
she took to beauty-parloring.

A HEAT-WAVE BALLADE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
No dazzling fancy let me hug,
Nor any warm emotion show,
But naked, sceptic shoulders shrug
And dabble in the bleakest woe.
■Tis. all too hot for words that glow;
Bring threnodies of utter dole,
Or odes that paint in cadence slow
The gleaming ice around the Pole.
I would I were a happy slug.
Clad but in moisture, lying low
On some fresh-watered lettuce rug,
Or wand’ring where cool seedlings grow;
Or just to be a frog and blow
My bubbly song in some deep hole —
Its burden would be ever: “Oh,
The gleaming ice around the Pole!”
Parched longings at my spirit tug,
And in sweet dreams a ghost I go
By those white fields for aye undug
Where frosts their glittering harvest sow,
Spray freezes on the drifting floe,
Great bergs, resplendent, calve and roll ;
And glimmers there, through falling snow,
The gleaming ice around the Pole.
Envoy.
Oh, chill Diana, string thy bow
And loose my suffocating soul,
For it would ride the winds and know
The gleaming ice around the Pole!

“Malua” : On the last trip of the 200-ton
schooner Kaeo from M.L. to the out-of-the-
way island of Niue, a squall put her on the
reef, bow on. In a few hours the little
vessel broke in two, but the crew managed
to get off with sufficient provisions to last
for a few weeks. After they had shaken
the salt out of their whiskers, Captain Mac-
donald, the second mate and one seaman
set sail for Apia, Samoa, in a 17-foot whale-
boat, and completed the 300-mile voyage,
despite heavy squalls and head winds,
in nine days, their commissariat being re-
duced in the process to a few biscuits and
a little water. Also, there was half a bottle
of precious whisky. The Samoan Govern-
ment sent a steamer to bring off the cast-
aways ; but first it confiscated the half-bottle
of whisky. Apia is a dry area!

“Herodot”: It might be hard to find the
ex-A.I.F. member with the greatest number
of wounds, but the most fearfully-wounded
man I ever saw belonged to one of the bat-
talions at Polygon Wood. He had been
struck in the abdomen by a piece of shrap-
nel with most horrible results. It was
nearly six hours before he was picked
up, and the fact that he had not bled to death
was in itself almost a miracle. At the hos-
pital the parts were washed in antiseptics

and saline, numerous perforations were care-
fully stitched up, and the whole lot replaced,
the greater part of the job being done with-
out a general anaesthetic, and with only in-
jections of cocaine and morphine to alleviate
the pain. Subsequently the patient de-
veloped tetanus, despite all the precautions
that had been taken, and just as he was get-
ting over this, peritonitis made its appear-
ance. Still he did not die; he is in Aus-
tralia to-day, and. though he only gets about
with the aid of a stick and lives on special
predigested foods, he looks nearly as fit as
the next man. He is a living monument to
the skill and efficiency of the Australian mili-

tary surgeons through whose hands he
passed.
“Astor” : A cruel blow at the vanity of a
well-dressed criminal was lately delivered on
a Melbourne racecourse. Two or three ’tecs,
who had been ordered to deliver the crook
at the watch-house, deputed a wayback
trooper, who had been footslogging in the
city since the strike, to tackle the beautiful
creature and shove the bracelets on his
wrists. The rustic did the job in
style, but the stream of imprecation that he
faced would have made an angry cabman
sound like a nursery rhyme. “What the
d’ye mean, you ——!” roared the
captive. “Don’t you know, you , who I
am?” Yes, the bobby knew, and pushed him
forcibly along to the plain-clothes men, where
the fashion-plate, now crushed and heart-
broken, mournfully called on the Most High
to witness the degradation of being pinched
by “a bloke out of ‘On Our Selection.’ ”
Even now in gaol the insult to his prestige
is alleged to be causing him more concern
than the charge that is hanging over him.
“Coot” : The grant-
ing of a liquor license
to the Federal Coffee
Palace, in Collins-
street, Melbourne,
must have produced a
commotion in the
graves of the two
Jimmies, Munro and
Mirams. The great
building was erected
by Cold Tea in the
boom years, Munro
being chairman of
directors and Mirams
secretary. Over the
main entrance doors
was a plaster cast of
Mirams s head. W hen
the energetic little
man was used as a
scapegoat and sent
to prison in connec-
tion with the Premier
Permanent Building
Society’s affairs, the
head wa s hastily
scraped off —w hic ji
really was an ungraci-
ous thing for Cold Tea
to do; for it is pretty
certain that if Little
Jimmy had been a
Hash champagne guz-
zler he wouldn’t have
been specially selected
for attack. For many
years the old brigade
has fought strenuously
and successfully to
prevent a license being
granted, but at last
the inevitable has hap-
pened. C. Smith, mana-
ger for many years,
pursues evangelistic
work on Prince s’
Bridge as a hobby in
his spare time, and
immediately the Court
granted a license he
resigned his manager-
ship, while share-
holders from the
ancient days threw
their shares on the market for what they
would fetch —or thereabouts.
“Sixenate” : A laundry mark on a hand-
kerchief led to the identification of a body
foymd in Sydney Harbor the other week.
Many cases are built up on even slighter be-
ginnings. An empty cigarette box found
near the scene of a recent act of thuggery
had the name of a tobacconist on it. The
tobacconist was required to visit police head-
quarters, and. shown a number of photo-
graphs, he indicated one as being like a man
who had purchased cigarettes on the day of
the crime. Within a few hours the original
of the photograph was under lock and key,
with some additional evidence against him
in the form of certain stolen goods found in
his lodgings. The N. S. Wales C.I.D. gets
a lot of criticism, but it probably has its
work systematised as well as any force in
the world.
“Ike Hollar” : The High Court has decided
by majority that clerks are capable of cre-
ating an industrial dispute within the mean-
ing of the Commonwealth Arbitration Act.
The point has been at issue ever since the
bank clerks and, later, the insurance clerks,
organised themselves. The struggle of the
pen-pushing brigade to get industrial recog-
nition has been a long one. The first Clerical
Union was formed a year prior to the big
wharf strike of 33 years ago, and was an
organisation of writers as well as clerks.
E. «T. Brady was an official, and Rod. Quinn
a member. This union disappeared in the big
strike. The next Clerks’ Union arrived in Syd-
ney in 1908, and had a bitter fight with Premier
Wade to secure recognition under the State
Industrial Disputes Act. Wade insisted upon
fobbing it off with a Clerical Workers’ Act
—a futile measure which a Labor Govern-
ment years afterwards scrapped. In the last
few years awards under both State and
Federal Acts have been secured for numer-
ous divisions of clerks; and the position of
the rank and file, especially in the banks,
has been very greatly improved. Indeed,
the only people who, as a class, are badly
treated to-day are the country branch man-
agers. Or, at any rate, considering the re-
sponsibility they have to carry they are
wretchedly paid compared with assistants
whose job is almost mechanical.
“X 215”: Paddington (Sydney) professes
to be angry because a police trawler has been
let loose to patrol the district at closing-
time and gather up the drunks as they fall
out of the pubs. When Fosbery was
Inspector-General of Police his instructions
were that no man was to be arrested for
inebriation as long as he was able to stand
up and see himself home, or had someone
with him who could do the piloting. But
in those days the mate and the good Samari-
tan were more in evidence; nowadays the
alleged friends who are seen assisting drunks
home are often soulless robbers wlio seek
the first quiet spot to rob their charges, oo
the instruction has been varied to the extent
of providing for the arrest of drunks whose
condition is likely to make them the victims
of thugs and thieves. There are other dis-
tricts besides Surry Hills where no drunk is
safe; and the police trawler is the result.
Paddington is aggrieved at being included
among them; but seeing that a well-known
spieler was one of those who wrote object-
ing to the “unwarranted police action, the
squeal may not be all in the interests of the
drunks. # #
"Scrivener”: An ex-Digger who had casu-
ally accumulated a Scotch bride while on
leave in England, and as casually forgotten
her, has had to face the Court at West Mait-
land (N.S.W.j to answer a charge of bigamy.
The only evidence of the wedding with the
llieland lass was a marriage certificate, at-
testing that the ceremony had been conducted
in Scotch fashion — i.e., by declaration before
two witnesses. “The Scottish law permitting
such a marriage will have to be proved,” said
the ex-Digger’s solicitor. The Court held
that he was right; and as the police had no
evidence to offer upon Scottish law, the case
ended just there.
“Randolph Rentless” : For a 90s. per week
job as caretaker of a Sydney suburban School
of Arts 72 candidates lined up the other
morning, including several applicants with
University degrees; but the job went to a
man without any letters after his name.
There is a bob-a-nob restaurant in Pitt-street
which has a B.A. in its kitchen as the cook’s
offsider. One big ragshop counts amongst
its counterjumpers at least four graduates;
and I know of a Master of Arts who is
navvying on the city railway. Also there is
an old-time Uni. professor selling papers in
Sydney. But this last is a philosopher who
reckons that a couple of meals a day, cold
water to drink, some string to lace his boots,
and sunshine and ease are all that man
requires. As for the others, they are mostly
the sons of people who wouldn’t think of giv-
ing their sons a trade. So they gave them
what they called an education, and then
turned them adrift in the great army of the
unskilled —as utterly unskilled, so far as
money-earning is concerned, as any product
of the gutter and the corner-post.
* * * *
“lodine” : The most-wounded man I ever
helped to mend wasn’t a soldier at all; he
was just a bottle-oh. He had returned from
the northern no-license suburbs of Sydney
with a record load, and was sitting on the
front of the cart at the tail of a queue of
vehicles waiting to board the punt. Some
horses pulling timber up the hill past him
jibbed or failed to hold their load, and finally
upset it on top of him. We extracted 92
pieces of bottle-glass from his person, and
he had 23 other cuts and not one of them
serious. The worst injury was a broken
toe. His remark when we concluded labors
was: “Blime, anyone’d think a man had
been out with the push.”
THAT’S WHEN.

Why has the rich mustachio,
Waxed for dalliance or curled for war,
Withered and shrunk to the close-cropped mo.,
Smudge on an upper lip—no more?
Who shall the quaint goatee restore?

There was an odd discrepancy between
the real Frank Morton, who died, after an
operation, on Saturday night, and the Frank
Morton who survives in innumerable verses
and sketches. In his writings he was the
Great Lover—a disillusioned, yet still dan-
gerous. roue. In fact, he was a domesticated
Englishman, who w r as intensely proud of his
clever family, and of Manly, where he had
lived for years. His prose style was full of
irritating preciosities, though in speech he
was the simplest and most unaffected of
men, and while capable of criticisms which
were unkind to the point of bitterness, he
was extraordinarily good and helpful to
every artist he met. Scores of his most
spirited poems were defiances aimed at imagi-
nary enemies: actually there were few men
better liked than this eager, fanciful human
creature. His literary output was enormous.
There were issues of the Triad, of which
he was associate-editor, that had been almost
entirely written by him over one pen-name
or another; and he contributed largely to
The Bulletin and other papers in Aus-
tralia, M.L., the tI.S.A. and England. Neces-
sarily he did not always give of his best, but
his general level was high, and there is
enough really first-class work entombed in
the newspaper files of the past quarter of a
century to make a dozen ordinary reputa-
tions.
Brig.-General Horace Dangar, who died
suddenly in Melbourne on Saturday, was a
born soldier of the English type. He was
a fine all-round sportsman, a prominent
social figure in Sydney and Melbourne (he
had been A.D.C. to more Governors than
any man in Australia by the time of his
death), and a passionate enthusiast in his
profession. Shortly before the war he con-
tracted diabetes, and so lost the chance of
his lifetime. No doctor would pass him for
the A.1.F.. and he had to be content with the
job of Chief of Ordnance. He served in
the Boer War with the R.A.F.A., which he
had joined in 1889. He was a son of H. C.
Dangar, M.L.C., and unmarried.
The last of a queer fish:—
The Pacific has given up the body of Percy
Brunton, whose rude oratory, flavored with a wit
that wasn’t a bit Attic, has amused the idle multi-
tude in all the mainland capitals. Subiaco (W.A.)
was Percy’s birthplace, and he started his career
as a public entertainer by hiring a hall at Collie,
centre of Westralia’s one coalfield, and discoursing
on the iniquities of the first (1904-05) Labor Gov-
ernment, then on its last legs. He fared better
when he combined park spouting with the selling
of peanuts. He had rather a fine voice, together
with a certain fluency and gift for repartee. But
he was foul-mouthed in his cranky moods. The
police voted him an obstructive nuisance, and a
state Governor had to prosecute him for an obscene
personal attack, shouted in the streets. A persis-
tent candidate for Parliament, he generally succeeded
in losing his deposit. But on one occasion he
finished higher on the list than an ex-mayor of
Perth, and on another he polled more than a young
lion Of the Westralian Liberals—and that when he
was m gaol.

K.C. .and ex-politician who has become a
British Liberal M.P. Another is Ned
Harney, who scraped in for South Shields
last year, and lias increased liis majority
of 25 to one of 7295. Harney, too, is Dub-
lin-born, and was one of the original W.A.

T. R. Bavin, now Ma State Attorney-Gen-
eral, had been acting-professor for six
months. The son is a brainy youth, lias
catholic sporting interests, and for two years
lias helped to edit the University magazine,
William Slater, the only lawyer in the
vi c . Labor party, who was dined last week
by the Lawson Cabinet in recognition of his
engagement to Miss Maisie. Gordon, is one
0 f the shyest politicians on record. He some-
what bashfully seeks Costs, in Hamilton,
and apparently no amount of practice in
public speaking will ever remove the note
0 f diffidence from liis voice. Still, lie deli-
vered some shrewd remarks on the Public
Safety Bill lately, and both sides of tlie
House take what lie says pretty seriously.
With the death of ex-district surveyor It.
Ba >' lis Mackenzie there goes one of the
oldest Government surveyors m N. S. Wales.
Entering the service as a draftsman in 1876,
] 1( . joined the survey staff three years later,
an( j was subsequently district surveyor at
Dvi bbo, Bourke, Grafton and Orange. At
onc time lie was Chairman of the Closer
Settlement Advisory Board and tlie now do-
funct Reserves Revision Board. He retired
j n j 920, but lie had come from a family of
surveyors , and the thing was in liis blood,
] ie started private practice shortly after.

Lieut. Tofler, M.C., who drops into tlie
job of sec. of the new Sydney Jewish War
Memorial Hall, is only 27 now, and was a
mere lad when lie enlisted in tlie A.I.F. He
got liis Cross for going forward and cutting
the enemy’s wire when an attack was held
up, and then, though badly .wounded, and
with his right hand hanging useless, leading
his platoon through and taking his objective.
Incidentally,. using his left hand, he shot
with his revolver the entire crew of an
enemy machine-gun. Before the war he was
an employee of David Cohen and Co., and
has the influence of the powerful Cohen
family behind him.
One of Garibaldi’s warriors passed out
with the death of chemist P. V. Armati at
Townsville (N.Q.) the other day. Born 77
years ago in Rome, he had bagged a whole
string of degrees, civil and ecclesiastical,
before attaining his majority. After some
stirring times in the ranks of the Red Shirts
a chance meeting with Bishop Quinn de-
cided him to accompany that cleric to Aus-
tralia. A little over 55 years ago he landed
in Townsville, and started as a chemist. A
mercantile venture with T. Frairie proved
very successful, and Armati retired to live
in Sydney; but the bank smashes of the
’nineties sent him back to the pills business
in the northern town. A son, Leo, is on the
literary staff of Melbourne Sun.
The inevitable Australians turn up in the
House of Commons after every election these
days. The last batch includes Crawford
Greene, son of the late G. H. Greene, of
landra, Grenfell (N.S.W.).
Captain Bulmer, just dead at Cremorne
(Sydney) at 86, dodged death by missing
the Dunbar on the trip which she finished
by trying to climb into Sydney Harbor over
the Gap in 1857. He was an officer of the
vessel, but was kept in England by a
family bereavement when she set out on her
last voyage. He made several trips to Aus-
tralia later, and finally settled in the coastal
trade.
C. R. Hodge, now retiring on a pension,
has been on the staff of Adelaide ’Varsity
for nearly 40 of the 4S years it lias been in
existence. The staff when he joined it con-
sisted of “four professors, two lecturers,
myself, a clerk and a caretaker,” and Arts
and Daw were the only degrees available.
He succeeded .T. W. Tyas as Registrar at
the end of 1891. In his leisure lie plays
bowls, and has written a novel or two.
Another Rhodes Scholar to make good is
Len G. Brown, who has bagged an F.R.C.S.
(Eng.). From Brisbane Grammar he went
in 1909 to England and graduated with
honors at Balliol College, taking the M.A.
and M.l). He came out of the war a Lieut.-
Colonel with an M.C. and two “mentions.”
After practising for some time as a special-
ist in London, he now has a berth in the
London Hospital. Always a keen athlete,
he captained the England Rugby team on
several occasions. J. G. Brown, late General
Traffic-manager for the Q. Railways, is his
dad, and a brother is Dr. Graham Brown, of
Brisbane.
Justice Higgins, of the High Court, goes
to the Cold Country on the same vessel (the
Ormonde) as Vic. C.J. Irvine, also on a
year’s furlough. They started their political
careers on the same day in the Vic. Leg.
Assembly (Oct. 4, 1894) —Higgins as the
Radical-Liberal member for Geelong, Irvine
‘as the Conservative-Liberal member for
Lowan. Higgins lasted for two Parliaments
and Irvine for five before going to the Fed-
eral Parliament. Irvine became Premier,
but Higgins was one of the 10 elected by
Vie. to the Federal Convention—a distinc-
tion he prized more than a Premiership.
Each became Commonwealth Attorney-
General —Higgins under Watson, Irvine
under Cook. Irvine accepted a title; Hig-
gins has dodged one. Both saw the light in
Ireland. Irvine will get a great welcome in
the North. Higgins an ovation in the South.
Sixty-three years ago Richard Maitland,
a Scotch youth of 16, landed at Maryborough
(Q.) and took up first Gigoomgan station
and then Boompa, whereon his keen judg-
ment in the matter of r ,ock enabled him to
breed some superfine beef cattle and draught
horses. With the break of a single, trip to
his native heather he resided in the same
district from the time of his arrival in Aus-
tralia till he died the other day.
C. W. Watt, who has just pit on the
mayoral bunny-skins at North Sydney, is a
brother of the Speaker of the House of
Reps.
December 3 was the 69th anniversary of
the Eureka Stockade. The Timaru (M.L.)
Post of that date published an article on
the event from recollections supplied by John
L. Potter, of Timaru, whom it claims as the
only survivor—“a man intimately acquainted
with all the actors in the drama and himself
a participator in the famous defence.” The
veteran is described as “within hail of the
century.”
“Pip Tok”: In the new gunners’ recre-
ation-room at George’s Heights, Sydney, are
a couple of pieces of stage scenery which for
many years adorned the stage of the gym-
nasium at Victoria Barracks. They were
paid for out of R.A.A. canteen profits and
bear the signature of W. Elliot Johnson.
“The Deacon” : Monsignor McGuire, men-
tioned by “Cheezo” (B. 13/J2/’23) as
allegedly being turned down by Bishop Gal-
lagher as a coadjutor, is the big man in
the northern N.S.W. cow country. He is vicar-
General of the Lismore diocese and adminis-
trator of St. Carthage’s Cathedral. Terence
was born 40-odd years ago at Gladstone, on
the Macleay River, and went through the
Cardinal’s College, Manly, but finished up in
Rome. He was for a few years _ a junior
professor and Dean of the Cardinal’s College,
and will be well in the running for its next
president. He is persona grata with the
bishops, and will get tlieir support. Only
extreme youth kept him out of the list of
nominations when Bishop Jeremiah Doyle
died suddenly at Lismore 15 years ago.
McGuire is the president of the Manly Old
Boys’ Union, having succeeded Monsignor
King, late of the A.I.F. Incidentally, the
late Bishop Gallagher, at the close of each
annual Synod, used to exhort his clergy to
be sure if anything happened to him to
select one of their own —“The divil ye
know,” he would finish up.
DEOCH AN’ DORIS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
[Mr. Frank Morton died at Lewisham, Sydney,
last Saturday, after an operation performed two
days previously. With two or three other sets of verses
which he posted to The Bulletin just before he
went into hospital was the following very character-
istic contribution.]
I’ve lived, and I know how to live,
However lean my purse is;
And so I chuckle, undeterred
By other fellows’ curses.
I’ve loved, and that’s a thing worth while
If you know how to do it... .
Lord ! I’ve no patience with the oafs
Who feebly love, then rue it.
And so I’ll leave this little life,
When comes the summons splendid,
Eager for what shall be, content
With all the pleasures ended.
I know not —nay, not I —what comes
After this long wayfaring,
But still I know that over all
Is Someone, greatly oaring;
Caring for me and all I am,
With all my 'sin and sorrow,
Just waiting with my Brother there
To take my hand to-morrow.
Right well that Brother pleads, I know,
And Someone still is heeding,
So that love wraps me round and round
Because of that one’s pleading.
Mv life is hid with Christ in God,
Who’ll succor and restore me
Should I be wearied with the way
When I pass where the starshine ends
And break into the golden day
To meet the comrades dear and friends
Who’ve passed that way before me.
FRANK MORTON.

Your own Cold Storage
Plant at Home.
ISKO is a simple device that
Manufactures Cold, convert-
ing your Refrigerator into a
miniature, self-operating Cold-
storage plant connected with the
house current, doing away entirely
with the use of Ice in the home as
a refrigerating agent, at the same
time introducing a method of
food preservation more conveni-
ent, more sanitary, more economi-
cal than that afforded by blocks
of melting ice.
It is an independent unit, can
be attached to any refrigerator or
Ice-box, and is absolutely fool-
proof.
It is automatic in operation and
so simplified mechanically that it
needs no expert attention.
It makes fifty cubes of Ice every
day.
The cost of current is trifling,
and the machine can be worked
on any voltage from 32 Volts up-
wards.
A complete model of this Isko
Automatic machine of one-ton
capacity, suitable for Residential
Hotels, Butchers, etc., is avail-
able.

Refrigerator Cabinets made to order and machines fitted.
THE chambers and motor are
mounted on a single base,
which may be set on top of
the refrigerator or in an adjoining
room. The glycerine-tank, made
in sizes to fit various standard re-
frigerators, is placed in the ice
compartment and connected to
the machine by two seamless
copper tubes. The only moving
parts of Isko are the the two rotat-
ing gears of the compressor,
which run submerged in a sealed
chamber of oil and are direct con-
nected to the
motor. The refrigerant—a harm-
less gas—is also sealed in its
chamber. When cooled under
moderate pressure it becomes a
liquid, and as such is supplied to
the expansion coil of the tank,
where it expands into gaseous
form, extracting the heat from the
chest. When it has absorbed its
quota of heat the compressor re-
moves it from the expansion coil
and delivers it to the condenser
chamber, where the water, circu-
lating through the cooling coils,
carries off the heat, and the gas
again becomes a liquid and is
ready to start on another journey.
This simple process is carried on
in continuous cycles. Isko is auto-
matically operated, and can be set
to maintain any suitable degree of
cold in the refrigerator, the cur-
rent clicking on and off at the pre-
determined temperatures.

ABORIGINAUTIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES LINSEED OIL
“Pick”: I have first-hand and indisputable
evidence that the cuckoo first lays her egg abroad,
and then carries it to the hatchery of the sillies
who do the foster-parenting. We were sweltering
in the shade of Charley Mullet’s verandah, at Rose
Vale (N.S.W.), and the languid talk had been about
a finch’s grass domicile in the adjacent passion-
fruit vine. The builders weren’t at home at. the
moment, and examination revealed three tiny pale-
green eggs in the nest. Not a minute after the
inspection a greenish-brown bird darted towards the
finches’ abode, and, almost without a halt, flew off
again. Thinking the visitor hqd attempted a burg-
lary of the finch-fruit, we at once re-inspected.
There were then four eggs aboard, one of different
color and considerably larger than the others.
* * * *
“Leonora”: The fact of a kangaroo’s
heart beating for 20 minutes after apparent death
can’t be as uncommon as “Ross” (B. 15/11/’23)
imagines. A few nights ago, w-hile we were rabbiting,
two bunnies were knocked over by a shotgun at
rather short range. Both heads were blown com-
pletely off, and yet, when we cleaned the carcases,
the hearts, though taken right out of the bodies and
severed entirely from the other internal apparatus,
continued to beat for about 15 minutes while we had
them under observation, and were still beating when
we left. It was found that pressure with the finger
on the organ altered the rhythm of the beating—
it either increased in rate or became spasmodic.
“R.P.” : Old Joe spat in the fire and re-
marked ; “Talking of savage dawgs, I ’ad one once,
and ’e was that fierce I ’ad to give ’im ’is tucker
on a long-’andled shovel. ’E was that bad at last
that I reckoned I ’ad to get rid of ’im.” “How’d
you do it —poison him or shoot him?” asked someone.
“No,” said Joe, “the night before I was going to
fix ’im some cow come an’ shook ’im, chain an’ all.”
* * * *
“Mary Jane”: A while back my husband
went a-fishing for dingoes. He fixed a large fish-hook
to a length of wire and let it hang from a tree, about
2ft. off the ground, then baited it firmly with a small
lump of suet. Next morning he went down and
found a good old mother dingo fastened on the hook
—and three pups breakfasting contentedly. lie
grabbed the youngsters and put them in a bag (got
a nasty gash on the right wrist in the operation,
by the way), shot the mother, took her scalp, and
stalked home in triumph.
“The Rumpus”: In a lane two youths had
donned the mittens and were handing it out to each
other, while an Irish terrier looked wisely on.
Presently along came a man who volunteered to
show the combatants a few new hits. One of the
youths at once passed over the gloves. The new-
comer engaged the other boy, who appeared to be
the owner of the dog. The tyke resented the arrange-
ment, and with a sudden yelp rushed in and made
a snap at the man’s leg. He missed by a tooth
and got the boot instead. “Don’t kick ’im, mister,”
shouted the lad ; “box ’im.” Nothing loth, the man.
crouched and faced the terrier with the gloves. An
exciting five minutes followed, during which the boxer
had to use his head and smiting strength for all he
was worth, his safety lying in driving the fiery
canine back as far as he could with each blow.
There was no time for breathing, the bout being all
in, and would have gone on until the animal winded
his man had not the dog’s owner closed on his four-
legged cobber and ended the fight.
“llori”: As recent Abo. pars, have shown,
“grafting” operations are usually simple in the
young. But Mum was
a grandma. The boys
were away, and while
splitting the kindling
she neatly amputated
the middle finger of
her left hand and al-
most severed the first
and third. She groped
in the sawdust for the
lost bit, and rode with
her youngest into the
village—l 4 miles. The
finger fell out of the
“hanky” on the way,
but they found it
again. “I don’t mind
much,” she explained
to me; “I’m gettin’
on now —but give it
a chance if y’ can.”
Which 1 did, suturing
the tendons and taking
ordinary precautions
against tetanus, etc.
In a few weeks all
external stitches were
taken out, and 1 now re-
mains only some stiff-
ness in the middle
digit. It illustrates,
of course, the wonder-
ful vitality of your dinkum bushwoman.
* * * *
“AdeL” : Is there more than one kind of
death-adder in Australia? In this remote district
(Lower Gulf of Carpentaria), one meets with a small
reptile to all appearances a death-adder, but with
distinct markings under its belly. It does not seem
to grow more than lOin. in length and 3in. in cir-
cumference. Of all the wrigglers in the Gulf coun-
try, it is the most dreaded by the natives; but it
seems to me unreasonable that the little reptile should
be so feared —its mouth is so narrow and the grooved
fangs are set so far back that it could not possibly
embed the latter in human flesh except, perhaps, the
fingers or tods of a child.
* * * *
“Azac”: The theory that a freemartin —a
heifer born twin to a male calf—is not capable of
reproduction was given a bad knock a while back
when a Holstein cow in California finished a 365
days’ test with 955.21 b. of butter from 27,160.51 b.
of milk. The latter figure is a world’s record. This
cow is only three years old, and although a free-
martin was given a chance because of h r valuahl
pedigree. She produced a calf at normal age, and
her observant owner soon noticed that she was a more
than ordinary milker; so he decided to test her,
with the result quoted.
RETTING HIM RIGHT.
“Ah, my poor man, the old, old story—too much beer!”
“No, shir, you’re - — hie — qui’ wrong, shir! Ther’sh — hie —not too
much beer in the worldsh!”
“Gylandah” (M.L.) : Re “T.A.C.’s” one-
armed teamster (B. 11/10/’23). The carrier
attached to our local store has only one arm, and
besides driving two horses he carries sacks of sugar,
bran, spuds, etc., on his back from the , cart to the
houses. Up till a short while ago he was a good
footba ler and a fair tennis player, and he is as fast
a milker as anyone in the district. The other day
1 watched him taking the store alarm-clock to bits
for a kerosene bath. He held it on the counter with
the stump of his shoulder while taking out and
replacing the screws—and some of ’em were darned
tiny !
“Mundee” : Re this matter of bucking and
non-bucking youngsters. Here is what Captain
Hayes, in nis “Points of the Horse,” said about it
20 years ago:—
Buckjumping is evidently an instinct which the
wild ancestors of our present horses acquired, in
order to rid themselves of the carnivorous enemies
that pounced on their backs. Naturally, the longer
a breed of horses has been under the influence of
domestication, the less inclined are its members to
buck. I have ridden many bad buckjumpers among
horses which were bred in a more or less wild state
in Australia, New Zealand, North and South America,
South Africa arid the Russian steppes, but I have
never known English, Irish, East Indian or Arab
horses to buck. I remember that almost every
“green” Australian horse which was imported into
India 40 years ago was a buckjumper; but this
vice has now become much rarer among Australasian
horses, owing to their being reared under more
civilised conditions.
“El Dorado” : A while back I gave a few
instances of the gluttony of the fresh-water cod;
here is another which occurred lately. We placed
about 10yds. of fine net in the river (Darling) to
obtain small fish for bait, and a little while later
noticed a commotion thereabouts. On making investi-
gations we found a 301 b. cod with part of the net
hanging out of his jaw—the rest was stowed away
in his tucker-box. Failing to extract the fish from
the net he apparently got na .;ed and went the whole
hog.
“Delver”: Various people have been given
the credit of being the first to hear the abo. call
“coo-ee” ; but the first to put it on paper was
John Hunter, R.N. He did it on July 5, 1789,
during his survey excursion to the mouth of the
Hawkesbury. Having tried several of the arms of
Broken Bay while searching for the river, he decided
to try to get into conversation' with some of the
natives, who, though not to be seen, could be heard
in the adjacent bush. Hunter thereupon gave voice
to the call, and with it brought a couple of abos. to
the spot. Although he presented them with a
hatchet and other articles he could get nothing
intelligible from them, and returned to the watery
maze. Hunter, by the way, spelt the bi-syllable
“coo-wee.”
“D.M.C.”: Nothing like pictures to give
the kiddies a real grip of natural history ! I saw a
book of Australian animals lately, in which one
illustration showed the ’possum swinging on a bough
by its tail, with—-a bird in its mouth!
* * * *
“Parama”: I nominate “gomada” as the
filthiest tipple man has
yet been offered. It’s
an evil-looking. green
mess much favored by
the New Guinea nig.,
and has the effect of
producing a mild jag
in which the head be-
comes confused and
the legs confuseder. It
has quite taken the
place of the well-
known palm-toddy,
and though prohibited
by the Government, is
made in large quanti-
ties in the ‘‘gardens”
lying out of sight,
and is brought down
the Fly River in
canoes. “Gomada” is
the name of the nettle-
like plant from which
the stuff is made as
well as of the drink
itself. The weed grows
to about sft. high.
Leaves, stalks and
roots are all thoroughly
chewed by every mem-
ber of the manufac-
turer’s family who is
not otherwise engaged,
the resultant mes 3 be-
ing spat out into a
calabash, wooden bowl
or bamboo tube, in
which it is mixed with
water and left to fer-
ment for 48 hours,
when it is strained and
considered ready for
use. I might have
sampled the stuff, as
I’m generally ready to
try anything once, bub
I saw it being made.
Some of the chewing
machinery was too old
and out of repair for
my liking. But I did
smell it, and I haven't
got over that yet.
“Bill R.”: “Larry Longun” declares (B.
22/11/' , 23) that the best green-hide comes from a
working bullock that has met with sudden death. I
have plaited hundreds of stockwhips, halters and
tying-ropes, and the best bit of hide that I ever
worked came from a cow that died calving in a
shaded glen and remained unskinned for fully a
fortnight after her death. I agree with “Lawrence
that to produce good hide a beast requires to be in
fair condition; but the way the animal died is not
nearly so important as the method of curing the
skin. My plan is to use salt very sparingly -n
the process, but to work into the pegged-out hide
as much white wood-ashes as it will absorb.
HORSEFLESH.
LADY PUNTER : “No, perhaps this course
doesn’t suit him. But what course
would?”
GENTLEMAN DITTO: “Well, I should say he
ought to come in somewhere between the
soup and the sweets in a cheap eating-
house.”
(Continued on page 2?f.)
HOME COMING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
With pleasure radiant in our midst,
And trouble worlds away,
Along the Barrier Range we drove,
Glad folk at break of day.
As on we sped, within our hearts
Pure peace without alloy,
Our Arab ponies, glossy black,
Stepped swift on hoofs of joy.
Sweet tints of dawn lay on the land,
Sweet lights on bush and tree,
Till suddenly, like some great flower,
The sun rose rosily.
Then blew a breeze upon our brows,
A breeze fresh-bathed with dew,
And o’er our heads on jewelled wings
A flock of parrots flew.
All sparkling grew the scrub around,
Its dew-wet leaves and stems,
As though the sun had poured on it
A casket of bright gems.
i
To greet the sun, on royal wings
An eagle rose in flight;
Red glow'ed lone hills of broken quartz
Beneath his lavish light.
On either side in tree and bush
» Birds moved, a busy throng;
We hailed with joy the risen sun,
And greeted him with song.
We sang a song of camp and track,
And as we singing sped
Far down beneath us, wide and strange,
The salt-bush plains outspread.
Our mated Arabs sped along,
Bright-eyed and light of hoof,
Mile after mile, till we descried
A smoke-wreathed homestead root.
Above it arched an azuye dome,
Around the plains rolled free;
A little island place it seemed
Set in a salt-bush sea.
Home-coming folk, upon us fell
The joy of all who roam ;
Though islanded in loneliness,
To us that place was home.
PURELY MEDICAL REASONS.
“Now, tell us about it—why DID you steal the purse?”
“Your Honor, I won’t deceive you —I was ill and thought the change
might do me good."
Home, love and peace stood nigh at hand,
Long leagues lay at our back;
And as we reached the homestead gate
We sang of camp and track.
And as we saw its trellised porch
And neared its open door,
We sang of wanderings at end,
And happiness in store.
For all who travel land and sea,
And all who rove and roam,
They know there is no joy on earth
Like that of coming home.

“Riverina”: I knew a man who walked
from Moulamein (N.S.W.) to Balranald in one day,
and wasn’t knocked up either, although it was a
50-mile stroll. But this great feat was eclipsed
when a well-known Edwards River cook left Denili-
quin on foot at 6 o’clock one evening and arrived
in Moulamein about 7 next morning, with bare feet
swoollen and bleeding. The distance covered was
roughly 70 miles. “The horrors” were responsible
for the wonderful run, and the poor devil had vivid
recollections of dodging weird forms round numer-
ous box-trees by the way. Rain had softened
the blacksoil somewhat, but the torturing bindy-eyes
were thick in places, and must have been simply
hellish to the unfortunate record-breaker.

Water him walk-about:—
“Centre”: “Steve Hart” asks whether anyone else
has seen a waterspout inland (B. 29/11/’23). I
saw' one a good many years ago in S.-W. Q’land,
and am not likely to forget it. Two of us were
camped beside a w'atcrhole in Bulloo Creek one
blazing hot day, when a swirling column of sand,
refuse, dead bark and leaves came staggering across
the sun-cracked earth towards us. It looked to be
at least 200 ft. high, the top thinning, then spread-
ing- out and scattering rubbish broadcast. Before
we knew what was happening, it had licked the
earth clear of everything movable near us, including
our fly, blueys, etc., and was mopping up the water-
hole. The roar it made as it took the water up was
very different from its previous note. We both got
the wind up for a moment, the whole thing had been
so sudden; but an old dead and partly burnt gum
that the column butted into gave it the k. 0., and
it expired then and there, shedding mud, rubbish,
and our gear over the scenery. Our compensation
came later, when we discovered a few good-sized
fish lying- about.
“Jacky Roo” : I saw an inland waterspout somew'hat
similar to “Steve Hart’s” just off the Cooma-Dalgety
road (N.S.W.) some years ago. A thunderstorm
had broken, and, with a gust of wind, the w'ater
rose from two sides of a lagoon in a solid sheet,
and met in the centre about 45 feet high.
* * * *
“Back Block” ; I have been reading The
Bulletin for 30 years and seen all the records
printed therein; but I want to turn on a new one.
Many of the Council must know old Bill Carson,
who used to knock about the south-west of West-
THE GLUE.
“My wife will know I drank too much at the banquet to-night.”
“Why, you're walking straight enough!”
“Rut look at the rotten old umbrella I picked out.”
ralia. Well, I nominate him as the greatest Bulle-
tin reader, and I’ve seen the old red rag all over
the world. At one timber mill Bill had a collec-
tion of 308 Bulletins in his camp at the one time.
Incidentally, I’d like to know if the old chap is
still going strong. He was one of Westralia’s best
woodcutters —-used to train on bully-beef and Bul-
letins, so the lads said. Anyhow, he was the best-
hearted bushwhacker' between Bridgetown and Bun-
l9 years ago.
“The Wanderer”: Years ago in the Gil-
bert Group the stingray was much sought after, as
it supplied the business-end of a weapon considered
necessary to all self-respecting te ane (women).
Several 6in. stings were collected and allowed to
become discolored and brittle before being bound
THE INCORRIGIBLE.
“Look here, Jones, your mate’s doin’ twice the work that you are.”
“That’s what I been telliu the cow, but he won’t take no notice
of ME speaking to ’im.”
to a cocoanut-wood haft, thus making a handy
weapon about 14in. long. This the lady kept
secreted until it became desirable to discourage a
lover, or dispose of a rival. The blow,
invariably aimed at the stomach, snapped off
the barbed spikes, leaving them firmly fixed
in the wound. A lingering and hideous death
was certain. Naturally, the men considered this
weapon unsporting, and its use was confined solely
to women. Recently I had occasion to visit the
Group again, and discovered this “dagger” to be
officially taboo; and it required a great deal of
diplomacy to secure a genuine specimen. The Gov-
ernment has ordered a great many changes, and a
new generation is growing up almost ignorant of
the ancient weapons and traditions.
* * * *
“Mamba”: “A Man out of Africa” (B.
29/li/’23) speaks authoritatively on rinderpest (lit-
erally, “guts-plague”),
but my. three-years’
residence in Griqualand
makes me think he is
in error in stating that
“as often as not inocu-
lation, like ‘salting’
with a bit of diseased
lung for pleuro-pneu-
monia, killed the beast
by blood-poisoning-.”
The actual loss from
blood-poisoning i n
pleuro, cases, when the
operation was carefully
performed, was less
than 10 per cent. One
old dopper of my ac-
quaintance, who had
traded all his life in
trek-beeste, was horri-
fied at even such a low
mortality as that, and
asserted that with care,
viz., antiseptic pre-
cautions, the loss was
negligible. The under
part of the tail was
carefully cleansed, and
a piece of affected
lung was bound in
between the fourth and
fifth caudal vertebrae.
The temperature fol-
lowing the ensuing
septicaemia dropped
after the fifth day, and
the tail below the in-
sertion sloughed off.
The beast was then
considered “salted” and
safe for pleuro. country.
“FY7”: “Keystring’s” pumpkin panegyric
(B. 29/11/’23) recalls that in the early and strug-
gling day's of cockydom, little of the precious vege-
table was wasted. Jimmy the Swallower, who used
to work the Balonne from St. George (Q.) to the
border and back, told me scornfully' of an experi-
ence he had with one of the early cockies. He
arrived about mid-day and asked the be-whiskered
boss if he could let him have some meat, as he was
going to camp. “No,” was the reply, “but if y’
like to wait, we’re goin’ to kill a pumpkin to-night,
and yer can have th’ insides.”
“8.V.E.”: “Nairn agoat” (B. 22/11/’23)
gets my vote as the
only one who knows
what he is talking
about in the damper
controversy —all the
others are merely
talking “powder bread”
or “scone loaf.” The
old dinky-di damper
was nothing else but
flour, water and salt,
mixed as stiff as possi-
ble and baked in a
hole in the white
floury ashes. And in
the days when it was
fashionable those who
made it didn’t worry
much about the class
of wood they used.
Anyway, the johnnie-
cake makers and dam-
per experts aire few
and far between these
days. About 99 per
cent, of the stations
willingly or otherwise
sling a loaf of bread
to the “traveller”;
s< rubcutters have a
permanent camp and
a “poisoner,” and
every droving plant
carries a cook with
good bread yeast or
powder in his outfit.
Personally, I have made
good johnnies by mix-
ing flour, salt, a little
sugar and water, light-
ing a good fire of light
stuff on a flat, even
surface, then brushing
the fire clean away and
baking the thin Jacks
on the bare, hot ground.
“The Overlander”: I mot them on the
great overland stock route on the Georgina River.
The mother was cook, two daughters were horse-
tailers, and the father and three sons handled the
3000 head of hornies. They told me they had come
from the Gulf and were bound for Maree (S.A.). With
luck they reckoned to make the delivery within five
months of starting. The cook invited me to a
cup of tea, and as I left I wished the. gallant little
family good luck.
“Riverina”: A cow at Hikutaia (M.L.)
has won notice by producing eight calves in two
seasons. Last year her contribution was a trio, and
this time she went two better. Unfortunately her
progeny are weakly and soon pass out, a bull calf
from her recent batch being the sole survivor of the
eight.
* * * *
“Borom” : In his comparison of the ordi-
nary Asiatic tea, such as is drunk in Australia, and
the South American yerba matte, one important
point is overlooked by “Leonard Matters” (B.
29/11/’23). While the matte contains theine —
slightly less than tea —it has little or no caffeine, in
which tea is rich, the average sample containing
from 5 to 6 per cent. It is because of this alkaloid
that we get from our national beverage its sedative
effect. The comparatively high content of tannin
makes no difference at all, except in the case of
excessive tea-drinkers, or in that of people inclined
to constipation—in reasonable amounts it has even
a beneficial and stinwlating action off the alimentary
tract. To those accustomed to tea, yerba matte
seems insipid and lacking in “kick.” No doubt it
suits the South American, who lives under easier
social conditions than the Australian or the Eng-
lishman ; but it would] never be a success in this
country.
* * * *
“Hobnobster”: Does any Abo. know Peggy,
the one-legged bagman travelling between Bunda-
berg and Mackay (O.) ? If anybody deserves a place
in the Endurance Stakes he does. I saw him in
Rockhampton recently, looking terribly thin and weak
on it, and when I asked him the reason he said he
had walked—or rather hobbled, as he has two crutches
—from Gladstone to Rockhampton, a distance of over
100 miles, on a loaf ana a half of bread.
*** . *
“Pat Busliie”: Busli surgery ? Charles
Steward, a big Greek, foreman of the gang building
the railway bridge over Telegraph Creek, near
Oab'oolture (Q.-), was caught on the calf of the leg
with the iron shoe when a pile, being made ready
for driving, suddenly swung in the ropes. It made
a ghastly mess, ripping and tearing the flesh and
laying open the muscle, so that it hung down round
the shin. Instantly the injured man clapped the
muscle back into position and tied a sweat-rag
round the awful wound, from which the blood
spurted. Jack Parker, a workman, lifted Steward
on to his back and carried him across the bare
girders over the seething 'stream to safety—in itself
no mean feat. In his tent Steward .sat up, calm
and collected, and asked for a packing-needle and
twine. With these lie sewed the flesh back into
position while his wife looked on. For three days
he refused the camp doctor permission to see the
injury, and at the end of three weeks was back on
the job again, limping badly, but otherwise none the
worse.
* * * *
“AdeL” : The quaintest of all our marsu-
pials is surely the kangaroo-mouse. My first
acquaintance with this little chap was made years
ago when collecting on the west coast of York
Peninsula. For days I wondered at the disappear-
ance of bits 0 f bread which had been left on my
table overnight, but as I could not detect any
finger-prints the robber could not be traced. How-
ever, one evening just as I sat to my meal a small
ardmal like a mouse dropped on my knee seemingly
from nowhere. It appeared to survey me for a few
seconds, then hopped on the table and without
further ado tackled my supper. Before I was over
my amazement at its cheek it leaped outside the
tent a clear 10ft. in one bound. An examination of
its footprints showed them to be a kangaroo’s in
miniature, and the average length of the jumps was
sft. or 6ft.
* * * *
“Hitam”: Tell “Warrawee,” wlio never
heard of a S’African mamba of over 7ft. (B.
15/11/’23), that in the neighborhood of the once-
famous Sheba gold-mine, Barberton, Transvaal,
black mambas of 10ft. are common. I never thought
of staying to argue with one unless 1 had a shotgun
—I have known a Swazi nigger pass out 20 minutes
after being bitten. The biggest I ever heard of
there was 14ft.
“Jarrah”: “Gossie’s” unkillable cat (B.
8/11/’23) has a counterpart at Cunderdin (W.A.).
On a recent Sunday, while some children were seek-
ing a lost ball in the grass by the house, our tabby
nose-dived among them and caught a 3-Jft. black-
headed yellow snake by the back —and was promptly
bitten. 1 despatched the wriggler, and in two
minutes the cat stiffened and threw a fit. I poured
some painkiller down its throat, and it seemed to
partly recover, but subsequently it stretched out as
if dead and, as darkness was setting in, life-saving
operations were suspended. Next morning puss was
found feeding her family as usual, though her eyes
looked like those of a man recovering from a bad
jag.
“S.R.” : “Zanthus” (B. 25/10/’23) was
misinformed about that tree at Wangarabelle which
he thought to be the biggest in Australia. In the
first place it is not a gum, but a yellow box. it
may be the heftiest box- in Australia, but it is not
the biggest tree ever, in this locality. The surveyor
who measured it in the first instance made a mis-
calculation. Those who have measured it since
have found it to be much short of 300 ft. in height,
and it is only 92ft. to the first limb. There is a
length of 90ft. of millable timber in the bole, cal-
culated to contain 14,000 ft. .Furthermore, the tree
is still growing, or was two months ago. In the next
parish there is a tree—a gum—larger in every way
and calculated to contain 16,000 ft.
* * * *
“ Jackeroo” : A Goondiwindi (Q.) grazier
recently' came across a black snake and a death-adder
in combat. The snake should have been disqualified,
as it deliberately confined its attack to the adder’s
tail, eventually almost severing it. This was too
much for the adder —with a tail that it couldn’t
wag, it threw in the towel. The grazier completed
the tragedy by knocking out the snake. It’s a hard
world.
* * * *
“Saaedi” : Frequently a blind sheep will
have a friend in the flock who cares for him faith-
fully and tenderly. If the afflicted one wanders out
ENOUGH FOR HIM.
“’Erbert’s deafness must be a terrible ’andi-
cap to ’im.”
“Oh, no; ’e can ’car anybody wot shouts.”
of the mob and commences walking in circles, bump-
ing into everything as he goes, his mate will set up
a frantic bleating, and, rushing to his side, will
guide him to safety again. Obviously the sound
sheep recognises and understands his pal’s misfor-
tune, and is inspired to an extraordinary protective-
ness by it. After the manner of a ewe with her
lamb he will exhibit the greatest concern and
courage when his afflicted cobber wanders into the
dangerous vicinity of the dogs. Seems to me we
have a bit to learn even from sheep.
THE FRIENDLY FLIES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A curious illustration of the prevalence of the fly
plague was afforded by a man at Goulburn, who
asked to be locked up as protection from the insects.
His manner was strange, and he insisted that the
same flies had followed him all the way from
Temora.”
They picked me up at Bungcndore
While lyin’ ’neath a tree ;
They follered on to Elsinore
And made a friend of me.
I’ve got to know the names of ’em
While trampin’ on the track —
That’s Nellie there, and this is Jem,
An’ yon old bloke is Jack.
They’ve drank me beer, and shared me toke,
But here the journey ends;
There comes a time when ev’ry bloke
Wants savin’ from ’is friends.
’Ow do I know, you fools demand,
That they’re the same old flies? —-
I know them by their voices and
The color of their eyes!
N.S.W,
HAMER.

Our new Cocked Hat, whose mother was
a Rawson and a sister of our old A r iking,
will find a good many relations in Australia.
Prominent among them are the Queensland
Rawsons, connected with the pioneering days
of Bananaland, who owned the Hollow at
Port Mackay. They were sons of Charles
Stansfeld Rawson, a senior member of the
clan and formerly in John Company’s ser-
vice, and cousins of the Admiral. All the
clan hail from Yorkshire, and are proud of
the fact that their holdings of land there
are registered in the Doomsday Book. One
of them still wins a precarious livelihood
from the original acres. He represents the
'*7th generation from the time the Book was
made.
The Ormonde lent itself for a ball in the
interests of the Prince Alfred funds on
Monday night. But tied to the wharf the
big boat was bereft of the romance that
hangs about a shipboard flutter on the vasty
deep—or even down the not-so-vasty harbor.
It did its best, however, and wreathed itself
with bunting and palms and soft lights;
and if the miles of deck spade didn’t pro-
vide a corner or two worth proposing in, the
young man can blame the girl, not the ship.
Hundreds of girls and young men danced
persistently during the long sticky night,
while older hands sat about the lounges or
on the _ cooler lower deck. Society was
absent in large quantities, but this made
no difference to the frocking, which was
varied and beautiful. One lady seasonably
wore a wreath of sultanas in her hair, and
otherwise trailed gorgeous draperies as saf-
fron as a dawn at Bagdad—or Bourke.
The evening party of the week was given
by the ‘Hugh Denison couple; as president of
the Royal Colonial Institute he extended the
cordial eye to its Fellows and Associates at
the Club rooms in Bligh-street. Trailing
silvered black tulles, whose back panel ad-
ventured into a small-dimension train, the
hostess added to her sartorial glory a posy of
velvety red roses. The flowers in the recep-
tion-room were gorgeous; Christmas bells
and Christmas bush glowed from every
corner, and the delicate blues and pinks of
massed hydrangeas were as cooling to the
eye as the night breeze that filtered through
the open window’ was to the melting flesh.
There are wards full of sick mites at the
Children’s Hospital; and at the magic whis-
per “Father Christmas!” the weakest small
one turns his head with a fresh interest in
life. So the visit of Santa Claus brings to
each bed the gift of joy in living as well
as the present from the Christmas tree. Will
you help the committee to make this the
cheerfullest season the big wards of pain
have known?
May their shadow never grow less!—that
must be the ardent wish of every naval com-
mander’s wife with regard to the trees on
the lawn at Tresco ; for under their spread-
ing branches many an enormous gathering
of sailors’ wives has happily supped its cup
of China or Ceylon. What would happen
if a really _ popular member’s farewell and a
wet day coincided one hates to think. Tresco
certainly couldn’t hold half the tally of the
Friendly Union that rolled up the other
afternoon for a last good-bye to Miss Muriel
Henderson. However, the sun shone even
if the wind blew, and sailors’ lasses and their
babies blossomed everywhere on the lawns
that stretch down to Elizabeth Bay. During
the afternoon Captain Craufurd and Chap-
lain Hardie rose to flights of eloquence de-
scriptive! of the guest-of-honor’s good works.
The lady was further overwhelmed by a
small travelling-case presented on behalf of
all hands by .Mrs. Craufurd, very tall and
kindly in white marocain.
Dr. Grace Boelke, who has been collect-
ing souvenir food for weeks past prior to
sailing off for America and Europe, is tre-
mendously popular with her own sex; and
it isn’t all because she has always worked
so hard in the interests of women, and is
a capable member of the different councils
and societies which have the other cat’s wel-
fare at heart. She was one of Sydney’s first
women doctors, and proved that good looks
and brains are occasionally measured out to
the same woman. She had the good fortune
to marry a doctor-husband, and their great
chumship ended only with his death a little
while ago. A group of fellow-National
Councillors met last Friday at Mrs. Eng-
land’s Manly home to drink a pot of home-
brew, while Ruth Beale discoursed on the
guest-of-honor’s career, and then handed
over a fitted travelling-case.
Derlwyn, the Justice Gordon home at
Elizabeth Bay, staged a quaint party on Fid-
day, when pretty little Mrs. Gordon hostessed
two rooms-full of fathers and mothers and
the covey of white-clad girls who have been
studying music with the same teacher as
daughter Anne. The Carreiios in muslin
whiled away the first hour of the flutter
with a musical programme, delivered with a
fine absence of nervousness. Teacher Lottie
Edwards smiled encouragement from a front
seat, and Mrs. Laurie Grossmith, herself no
mean musician, was among the vigorous
applauders. A small Allard girl and Anne
Gordon showed that singing mothers had
handed down the gift to their offspring, and
a rosebud named Dorothy Perkins played two
charming French pieces. After the music,
Mrs. Gordon, in a white frock that flew
cherry ribands at the waist, distributed a
tableful of prizes; and in turn was rewarded
by a gallon or so of eau-de-Cologne in a
crystal demijohn. This was a farewell
present from the kiddies who have studied
with Anne and Alexander, for the happy
classes at Derlwyn are no more. The first
to go were Daphne and Diana Davidson, and
next month Mrs. Gordon leaves for England
with her twosome.
The Sacred Heart Hospice at Darling-
hurst was a-flutter one morning last week
when the cheque from the Operatic Ball was
handed over: £1207 was the neat little total
which the Lieut.-Governor’s gentle lady fin-
gered. Mother Rectress was almost over-
whelmed by it, and an additional gift of
fruit and flowers; and Josephine Marks,
who had netted £221-odd, buried her blushes
behind a bowpot of congratulations. After
the meeting the community, which is the
soul of hospitality, entertained the entire
gathering to morning tea.
Lorna and Toots Pounds said “Merry
Christmas!” to Sydney at an outsize
luncheon party at the Carlton on Monday;
and for two hours not a man uttered a word
against the No-Water Board. Long-stemmed
pink roses streamed fragrance from huge
bowls down the two tables, and it was over
a bunch of such glory that the serene eyes
and sensitive mouth of Lorna breathed a
sincere “Glad to be back again!” which
passed for grace. Separated from Lorna
by Hugh D. Mclntosh, who acted as a sort
of Master of the Rolls, sat Toots, looking
like an Austin Dobson lady in a billowy
frock, green as the underneath of a dock
leaf. On her head she wore a green scuttle
bonnet that sighed rapturously to a pink rose
on each side. Lorna’s Greek type was
swathed in white maroeain, with a dignified
Paisley design on its tiny coatee. It was a
friendly party; everybody proposed and drank
his neighbor’s health, and the neighbor re-
sponded in kind. Mrs. Pounds, a very jubi-
lant mother, looked suspiciously like tears
when it came to Hugh D.’s turn to toast her;
and when Lorna told how Mother had made
their first dresses for a London theatre, and
how Revell had built their latest from
Mother’s design, the cheer sounded like a
whole shipment of “Rockets.”
Here’s Neville Joske, who collaborates
with sister Margaret Goyder in novel-
writing under the name of Margot Neville.
Their second
book, “T hi s
Can’t Be I,”
was published
the other day
by Leonard
Parsons. It
deals with a
young man so
much in love
that he allows
himself to be
mistaken for
a blackguard,
because h e’s
afraid if he
showed himself
the Bayard he
really is he’d
lose the lady.
The book fluffs
along pleas-
antly for 300-
odd pages. The
lady of the
picture helped the other half of the author
.'.at this novel, as well as their first,
“Marietta Is Stolen,” while living at Wool-
lahra. London is their present address.
The kiddies’ Christmas party at the Went-
worth drew a full house on Friday. Liter-
ally hundreds of fluffy little girls who looked
like powder-puffs in their organdies and geor-
gettes jazzed in the solemnity of youth with
one another or with small boys in best suits
and behavior. Everybody wore a cap of
magic-like architecture, and everybody flew
a balloon and had a dip at the lucky pump-
kin-pie in the Palm Court. The pie, by the
way, was fashioned from a pumpkin grown
on the same vine as the one Cinderella’s
coach was made from. At least, so a large-
eyed baby-froth of primrose georgettes con-
fided. The party was to swell the funds of
the Deaf and Dumb Society’s appeal.
Like some robber-chief of old gloating over
his moneybags, Sydney’s vice-reine Cullen
presided over the opening of the Blue Bags
at the Mary Elizabeth the other afternoon.
The society for giving the adult deaf and
dumb a lift over the stile rallied in battalions
to see the result of this new idea in long-
shore piracy, and the pretty white-and-gold
room was packed with jubilant women-folk
who all but cheered when the last pound of
the total thousand was counted out into the
hand of treasurer David Day. After that
there was tea and music, with much purring
congratulation for Mrs. Fred Aronson, who
had originated the idea, and for Mrs. Albert
Littlejohn, who had been a hard worker in
the effort.
The news of Frank Morton’s sudden death
last week shocked thousands who had never
seen him. Born a provincial Englishman
and a Baptist, he was Greek in his heart and
soul. He loved beautiful things—the sea
under a moon, children, comely young men
and women, good pictures, books and music
—with an in-
tensity which
was the sin-
cerest feature
of his odd.
whimsical
character. He
did many good
things in his
life, and only
one notably
bad one—his
easily-imitated
i d iosyncrasies
of style have
become the
literary stock-
in-trade of in-
numerable cal-
low wanderers
on the lower
slopes of Par-
nassus. A wife
and family
are mourning
for him at his beloved Manly, where he had
lived since he arrived from M.L. nearly 20
years ago. This photo of him was taken by
May Moore.
Sydney of the Sunshine has a way of doing
things all its own. One day last week re-
presentatives of the women’s bodies in the
city called on the Minister of Justice to put
before him the community’s need of women
jurors. This sounds a solemn, long-faced pro-
ceeding ; but if you had seen those alert-eyed,
clear-skinned women meeting outside the
Law Offices in Macquarie-street you’d have
thought they were contemplating a descent
on Manly. Washing frocks, mostly white
linen, wide-brimmed hats, floating veils and
gay sunshades were the wear. Nothing
funereal or blue stocking about this typical
group of Sydney women come to demand
another scrap of justice for their sex !
Who says Romance is deadV A feather
from his wing dropped on to a typewriter in
Sydney one day in September, and the little
dark girl who sat hammering the keyboard
without even a diamond signal flashing on
her left hand is now married to one of
Queensland’s rich station-owners, and sails
by the Narkunda to see the world. Nora
Hamilton, a well-known and popular St.
\ incent s pupil, was the bride; and the man
who has endowed her with his flocks and
herds, his men-servants and his maid-ser-
vants (perhaps), is Albert Smith, of Long-
reach and Coonamble.
Mollie. the daughter of the wealthy Gil-
mours, of Bathampton, Bathurst, who set
out on a world tour a while back, has cabled
from Gibraltar to her parents the interesting
intelligence that she has married Edward
Gray, of Philadelphia (U.S.A.), whom she
met on shipboard.
Phyllis, elder bud of Padre Kelynack, of
Stanmore, has just breathed her promise to
wed Clifford Burgess, of Vaucluse, at some
date to be hereafter named.
Joan Rayner, an attractive Maorilander
who has been away in England for the past
two years, dropped into Sydney the other
day m a yellow batik frock, shoulder-long ear-
rings, and an aura of enthusiasm over her
job, which is to sound the glories of the
Green Leaf dramatic movement beneath the
Southern Cross. As far as can be ascer-
tained from a bowing acquaintance with it,
the G.L. is a triangle of rhythm, movement
and drama, and its base is cemented in the
Greek school. It sounds as though it might
be frightfully alluring wedded to pretty
knees and the sort of sleeveless tunic affected
by exponents of the pastoral school of move-
ment.
Everybody who is interested in books knows

showing a few of her poems (most of them
written for The Bulletin), with Donald

Paymaster Lieut.-Commander Ricci, known
affectionately to every admiral, captain and
matelot as “Bartimeus,” the naval short-story
writer, is aboard the Dunedin, now on its
way to these shores with the Empire-touring
squadron.
Mrs. Graves Aickin, recently passed
out at Auckland, was the daughter of the
late Dr. Philson, assistant-surgeon to the 58tli
Regiment, who landed in Maoriland in the
early turbulent ’forties. Until Ilenare let
up a bit 011 his rampaging, officers’ families
had perforce to stay behind in the Parramatta
military barracks, and it was there that Mrs.
Aickin was born, in 1845. She was the
widow of Dr. Robert Elliott Fisher, R.N.,
when she married Dr. Aickin.
One of Australia’s brightest little hero-
ines, Irene Dee, of Byron Bay, has been
putting up a hard light for life. She is the
girl who, when her home caught lire during
her parents’ absence, got out safely, but,
remembering her baby brother and sister,
dashed back twice into the flames and rescued
them. The deed was done in spite of burns
so terrible that she was still lying in hos-
pital 21 months later, when a gathering of
Byron Bay people trooped in to see her
presented with the Humane Society’s bronze
medal and certificate. The Bay seems to
produce heroines naturally—only the other
day a 16-year-old girl swam out 500 yards
to rescue a man from the surf, and a few
weeks before that a woman saved a man’s
life by driving off a bull which had attacked
him.
If coming events cast their shadows be-
fore, another 25 years will see us with one
home-grown Governor at least. A small
Kirribilli boy departed the other afternoon
in the glory of his best suit for his kinder-
garten break-up—there was to be a concert
followed by a Christmas-tree. To mother’s
surprise, about half an hour after he had
set out he toddled in again. “Why, Brian,
what brings you home so soon?” asked
mother. “Oh,” replied her son in a bored
way, “I didn’t wait. I didn’t think it was
going to be much of a concert—they hadn’t
even spread a carpet!”
The bridegroom’s boots were new, and
sufficiently gigantic to be sure of attracting
attention. When he knelt at the altar it
transpired that some artistic friend had
painted a nude female on one sole and a
dancing devil on the other. Of course, it was
a country-town jest. That sort of practical
joke somehow doesn’t flourish in a city.
A Brisbane postscript:—
Freda Bage, M.Sc., who has successfully guided
our Women’s College through a stormy eight years,
is off on 12-months’ leave to England. In hqr spare
time this very live spinster, besides lecturing in
biology at the ’Varsity, presided over the Brisbane
Women’s Club and the Lyceum Club, was an office-
bearer in the National Council of Women and
Women’s Graduate Club, coached the Uni. hockey
team, and was associated with every female organisa-
tion of note in Brisbane. She is a Melbourne
graduate, and will be replaced by a S. Australian,
Miss Hunt, 8.A., a contemporary at Trinity College
(Melbourne). Miss Bage is to be the Bananaland
rep. at the International Women Graduates’ Associa-
tion meeting, to be held at Copenhagen in 1924,
and meantime Brisbane is going to miss her little
yellow runabout.
Sir Matthew opened the tennis courts at the
B. Q. Golf Club grounds amid much bunting and
garden vegetation. Dorothy 7 Perkins roses were set
about the vice-regal table, where, in addition to his
Ex., there were the Theodores, Justice McCawley
and his spouse, the George Browns, Guilford David-
sons and J. A. Walshes, Bobbie Frew and Mayor
Jenkinson. The tea was poured by sweet girl associ-
ates, and the Stewart clan dispensed the music.
Later on Sir Matthew visited Ascot racecourse,
and gave a tea to Mrs. J. T. Bell, the Whittinghams,
Dr. Connolly, the Tullys, and the Fox and Falkner
ladies, who are staying at Government House.
On his visit to Warwick his Ex. sojourned at
Canning Downs with the Barneses.
In a Japanesey setting of peach-bloom and wistaria
the National Council of Women farewelled Freda
Rage, and handed her a bunch of pink roses as well
as many cheery bon-voyages. The Women’s Club
also gave her a send-off, whereat there were musical
and elocutionary items, tea and laudatory speeches.
His Majesty’s, on a very hot night, had a very
full house to greet the return of De Tisne, Harring-
ton Reynolds, Lottie Sargent, Yvonne Banvard and
others. They hung a laurel wreath round De Tisne s
neck, and deluged the feminine portion of the play
with flowers. In the big audience were the George
Addisons, Robertsons and Pollards, and Barbara
Sisley, who is just back from the Cold Country.
Lena Hammond’s pupils carolled before a good
house the other night. Contralto Lena herself shone
forth in black satin brocade.
Sir Matthew looked in at Toowoomba a few days
ago and addressed a literary society and presented
the prizes at the Boys’ Grammar School, before a
gathering of smiling parents and brigadier-general-
and a few colonels. When he returned to Brisbane
he had the vice-regal board spread for a dinner-
party to the Fancourt Macdonalds, Davidsons and
others.
There was a good roll-up to see the pupils’ work at
All Hallows’, and hear an excellent musical pro-
gramme. That same night the Fiveways Kindergarten
had a Christmas party, whereat the youngsters had
a great time, and the mothers came in for gifts
made by the kiddies themselves.

Developing & Printing
Same Day Service.
REMOVAL OF WORKS,
We have pleasure in announcing that the removal of our
Developing and Printing Works to much larger premises has now
been successfully accomplished.
During the period of removal our service was necessarily
somewhat disorganised, and although we made our plans to keep
our time-table as usual, we were, for reasons quite beyond our
control, not always able to do so. To those of our clients who were
disappointed we take this opportunity of tendering our sincere
regrets
Our new Developing and Printing Works are more than twice
the size, and are equipped with the latest and best appliances, to
enable us to take care of a much larger volume of orders.
You will be delighed with the service we are now in a position
to give, and you will be more than ever satisfied with your prints,
bearing the well-known impress,
which the best-quality prints bear on the back.
Remember we have always been the leaders in the Developing
and Printing business. ,
Remember also that Harringtons were the first to give a
Same Day Service, which has proved such a boon to amateur
photographers.

MISSES MONN[?]DOYLE
Phones[?] Cantrel 1532, 1533,
The Red Cross Council beckoned members
of the Society to the disabled soldiers’ fur-
niture factory the other afternoon for tea
and a look-round at Billjim’s handicraft;
but barely a handful of the invited turned
up. Lady Stradbroke, in a magpie frock,
came, with Miss Curry in attendance, and
had a little say, and Owen Williams and
Gaud Mayor Swanson said a little more,
though it isn’t oratorically inspiring to have
hardly anyone to talk to. There was a
gasp when the Edward Miller dame dropped
a court curtsey to Lady Stradbroke, but the
countess, being a sport, politely pretended
not to notice, and shook hands. The soldier-
made furhiture and basketware came in for
much applause, and Owen Williams read out
a whole budget of complimentary references
from previous buyers. The vice-regal lady,
who also threw in an appreciation of goods
she had purchased at the factory, raised a
chortle by adding that she had not had
them long.
The Arthur Baillieus’ eldest hope, Kings-
bury, who landed back about two months
ago after topping off his school career with
a Cambridge course, has now persuaded
Gracie Lavers to forsake the footlights and
make him happy. The little lady, who is
at present adding to her stage laurels in
‘‘Sally,’’ will seal down - her make-up box
early in the coming year preparatory to
signing her life contract in March. The
bridegroom-to-be put up a fine sporting
record at Melbourne Grainmar, where he
pulled an oar with the Head-of-the-River
eight more than once. (The dark blues have
had a Baillieu, bTother or cousin, in their
crew for several years.) Mrs. Arthur Bail-
lieu belonged to the numerous Ham family,
so Gracie —she is the younger daughter of
the late Robert Lavers and his widow, who
lives at St. Arnaud, South Yarra —will not
want for ’in-laws.
Melbourne is chuckling quietly over the
loquacity of a Victorian Judge. When he
came to adjudicate on a matter in the County
Court lie found that he himself owed one of
the litigants 10 or 12 pounds, and lie boldly
announced the fact, advising the party to
send in an account. Of course this made
him ineligible to try the case; but having
dismissed that from his mind, he apparently
forgot all about the debt as well—until he
was reminded of his creditor by receiving a
garnishee summons! His Honor isn’t par-
ticularly tickled with the result, especially
as he had only a few days previously jest-
ingly referred to a brother Wig who had
been writted for libel as a result, he said,
“of being talkative on the Bench.”
The John Gibsons’ only daughter, Esther,
kept her matrimonial date with Henry Law,
from Singapore, in white georgette curtained
with silk lace looped with orange blossoms.
Bugled effects encircled the upper deck and
cascaded like a glittering waterfall down the
port side of her skirt. The bridal tulle,
weighted and coroneted with orange
flowers, floated trainwise in the rear, where
it was cleared from the dust by niece Betty
Gibson, a young person who looked as if she
had just strayed out of Fairyland. Winsome
Cowen and Elvie Carnegie ’maided in almond-
green silk, and Stanley Barber helped the
bride’s brother Aubrey to uphold the ’groom.
The Gibsons spread a wedding feast at No. 9
Darling-street, where the parlors blushed
rosily with pink flowers. Among the guests
were the bride’s knightly uncle, Robert Gib-
son, warrior John Monash with his daughter
Bertha and her husband, Gershon Bennett,
banker Morrice Williams and his wife, and
Mrs. Geoff. Syme.
The Austral Salon is cheering the year out
with a welter of afternoon parties. One last
week was hostessed by Mrs. Jefferson Wood
and Marie Spottiswood, the former hand-
somely satined in magpie effects, with a rib-
bon bow on her raven hair, and the latter in
blue and white silk Jersey,, topped by a pin-
cushion toquelet of flowers. Songs and a
Weston Pett flute solo were sandwiched
between a brace of entertaining playlets, re-
leased by Mrs. Maurice Dudley and Charles
Dyson. Natalie Dawson supplied the piano
backing. Heading the guest list was St.
Hilda’s Mayor Allen, with daughter Merle,
who was awarded a pink floral trophy,
lesser posies being handed to Mrs. Quinnell
and Mrs. Harry Vial. St. Kilda was further
represented by ex-Mayoress Mrs. Burnett
Grey and town-clerk Fred Chamberlain’s
cheery petticoated half.
Before the Legislative Assembly broke up
for the short Christmas recess members fore-
gathered to drink the health of Digger Will
Slater, Labor’s lawyer-member for Dundas,
because he was handing himself over for
keeps to Maisie Gordon, of Mildura. Later
the Laborites handed him a wedding present.
By the time this Letter gets into its print
dress the pair will have started on their
honeymoon.
On Friday afternoon the Botanical Gar-
dens tea-temple was not roomy enough to
shelter the Alfred Hospital Auxiliary Coun-
cil’s send-off to chairman IT. M. Collins, who
is booked for a 10-months’ trip to his native
Fog. General Brndenell White, who will
act as locum for the ex-G.O.M. of Reuters
on the Council, voiced the company’s era
revoir, and was backed up by W. J. Fookes.
The guest, who looks 60 or rather less, pre-
faced his thanksgiving with the amazing
remark that he had reached his SOtli mile-
stone _ the previous day. The cheery octo-
genarian made a speech that showed how it
is possible to look back on a long life-jour-
ney without jealousies or regrets and still
thrill to the joy of life.
General White seized the opportunity to
hurl a verbal posy at Beatrice Henty, who
is farewelling the Auxiliary Council and
steaming to England, and another at the
lion, sec., Mrs. Rupert Downes, who, with
three small children to look after, finds she
cannot spare the time to continue in the
job. She, by the way, was one of those
who originally launched the effort.
Brisbane’s Judge Lukin handed over his
elder daughter, Leonore, to Philip Phillips,
elder son of the M. M. Phillipses, of Arma-
dale, at Holy Trinity. East Melbourne, on
Thursday night. The bride trailed pale
pink draperies, interrupted at the hip line
with an opalescent glitter, under a pink
tulle bridal veil. The blushful color-note
extended to the pink water-lilies sheaved in
her arm. Sister Beryl, as attendant maid,
revealed a further and deeper rosiness in
shimmery satin, and had her head ambushed
in a silk-meshed veil moored with gold leaves.
Brother George Lukin saw the bridegroom
through the trying moments.
Irene Vanbrugh farewelled to a full house
at the King’s on Saturday, and the curtain
fled up and down many times before Dion
Boucicault came forward to say a few words.
There is a strong likelihood of the party
returning to Melbourne in June with an-
other selection of plays, including something
new by ,T. M. Barrie. Mrs. Boucicault, who
threw on a pink cloak over the white Tau-
queray costume to say “Good night, but not
good-bye,” looked very tired. Probably if
she had had a few more nights of shrilling
at Ellean her voice would only have been
fit to sell papers or fish.

ing any team of

gether with a

e s tablishnient
of the “Bou-
tique” in the

tal grounds,
where pat i-
ents, friends

tal staff cau
get anything from pins to fruit. The
Broadmeadows Foundling Hospital is aridther
of her pet philanthropies, and her latest big
effort was the caf<§ chaiitant in the Ormond
Hall, which resulted in a fine financial lift
for the Collingwood CiAche and Kinder-
garten. On top of all this the lady is always
in request in social circles and is president
of the Women’s Automobile Club.
Director Henry Russell had a regular field-
day on Thursday putting the acid on voices
competing for the smaller roles in Melba’s
grand-opera productions. The Dame was to
have given a hand, but did not turn up.
Russell is in a continuous simmer of enthu-
siasm over the quantity and quality of the
Australian warble; but he thinks it high
time we established a Society for the Pre-
vention of Cruelty to Voices. On Thursday
it worried his tender ear to notice the dread-
ful disregard for the niceties of vowel sounds,
and the passion for flowery cadenzas. Many
of the aspirants were turned down more or
less gently, but one voice, owned by a Miss
Benton, brought the director bounding be-
hind the footlights to take the lady for a
run back over her song at a quicker pace.
She, he thinks, will eventually scramble up
among the stars, providing she keeps her
head and gets into serious training.
There is, however, a good deal of heart-
burning over the selections for the chorus.
Almost all <jf the female voices will be found
in Australia, but hopes of the engagement
of a male Australian choir were dashed on
the arrival of Mr. Russell, and the little
crowd that was under rehearsal was in-
formed that a cable had' been sent off for a
score of Italians.
The- Henry Rosenthals’ just grown-up
daughter Elva, who was to have stunned
the natives with a saratoga-load of costly
dress creations during her few weeks’ stay
in Ceylon, has sent a dreadful wail across-
seas. It seems that some heartless brute
looted her trunks on the voyage between
Fremantle and Colombo, and left the poor
girl with nothing but her ship outfit to face
the Cingalese with. As a matter of fact,
apart from the financial aspect, the affair
is not quite so dreadful as it appears, for
dark-eyed Elva is an extraordinarily pretty
damsel, whose youthful charms will stand
out just as alluringly from simple frocking
as they would from a welter of costliness.
One of the silly-season newspaper contro-
versies is raging round, “Can a working-girl
dress herself on a pound a week?” Accord-
ing to one feminine dress-creator, the sum
would ; barely keep her work-girls in undies.
Perhaps this explains why the Best People
nowadays make rather a cult of the unim-
portance of clothes. The smartly-equipped
factory-hand would be contemptuous were
she to discover the smallness of the average
Toorak flapper’s dress expenditure. But,
then, Toorak doesn’t worry about crepe de
Chine hub-hums.
Dr. Roderick Atcheson, the younger, and
Mavis, eldest daughter of the woolgrowing
R. W. Laidlaws, were matrimonially shackled
at the Toorak kirk the other night. Mavis
made an attractive bride, in white brocade,
backed by a silver-embrdidered tissue train,
which peek-a-booed under the cobwebby
meshes of a Iloniton lace veil. A quartette
of ’maids, Marjorie Ennis, Mollie Salter,
Dortee Hasell and Marian Atcheson, were
chiffoned like woodland nymphs in yellow
crepe draperies under floating veils anchored
with autumn leaves. Arthur Uglow was
second-best man. with lan Laidlaw, George
Dallimore and Alan Staley in minor parts.
Banker Morrice Williams and his other
half are moving over to Sydney for a few
weeks to see something of their younger
daughter, Mrs. Colin Chisholm Ross, before
they reload their grips for a holiday jaunt to
England. They expect to sail in March.
The Alliance Francai.se farewelled its
president, Mrs. Jimmy Dyer, in the Anzac
House ballroom, with jazz and frivolity. The
star guest and her husband turned up rather
late, owing to a dinner at Federal Gov-
ernment House ; but they were forgiven. Con-
sul Turck spoke the words of farewell, after
which the vice-president, Madame Albertine
Gay, on behalf of her fellow-members, passed
a pair of enamelled lorgnette opera-glasses
to Mrs. Jimmy, whereupon that lady, who
was wrapped in vivid green velvet, anchored
to one shoulder with a jewelled butterfly,
lisped thanks very prettily. There was a
great roll-up for the event, and the English
tongue was heard almost as loudly as the
several brands of French used on such occa-
sions. Madame Yanderkelen made the room
more cheerful with rich pink draperies; Mrs.
Tliorald Harper’s black satin had a glittering
zone of jet and brilliants amidships; Cecil
Maudesley veiled her slimness in dusky laces;
Poppy McMillan’s green silk frock suggested
a Spring orchard in full leaf, and Madame
Gay’s black dress glittered with jet.
Educationists mustered in force at the
Oriental Hotel the other day to give a send-off
to L. J. Wrigley, inspector of secondary schools,
before he and his wife sailed by the Diogenes
on a trip to the Cold Country. When Han-
sen succeeds Fussell as Tate’s offsider, Wrig-
ley will become chief inspector of secondary
schools. He is one of the brilliant constella-
tion with which Tate is surrounding him-
self while not dimming his own light.
G. M. Beck, one of the big men of the
International Harvester Co., has received a
promise to \yed from Ethel Lloyd, whose dad
is a wool-raiser in the Riverina. Beck was
a very old friend of The Bulletin’s Alf
Vincent—the pair played marbles together
in Launceston in their youth.
The Victorian division of the A.J.A., pre-
sided over by H. A. Win ton, lunched its
potticoated members on Thursday at the
Francatelli —a cheery gathering, with pre-
sidential and other speeches as an accom-
paniment to the black coffee. Sandwiched
between the details of what this writing-
peoples’ association has done and will do for
members, was a joyous tribute to the effec-
tive activities of the Women’s Council repre-
sentative, Mrs. White. The women members
are now getting together to be more clubbable,
and will henceforth make it a point to lunch,
tea or dine visiting celebrities of their sex.
Teddy Dyson, under convoy of his wife,
steamed off to Colombo by the Mongolia
after having been divorced from his appen-
dix, Their small chick, June, and her nurse
will shelter with her maternal grandmother,
Mrs. Boyes, while they are away. The day
before they sailed Mrs. Monty Grover and
Airs. Ih. \. Richardson gave Mrs. Dyson an
afternoon-tea send-off in Menzies’ lounge.
J lie star guest, who beamed joyously over
tour presentation posies, wore a black frock
and a hat with a droopy brim. Her mother
foamed her waves of black chiffon into white
while her sister, Mrs. Russell Jackson, hi
coppery brown, practically interned her
pleasing countenance under an extinguish-
ing lid of autumnal hues. Mrs. Grover
dimpled engagingly in brown-caped hangings,
with a little flowered toque on top, while
Mrs. Richardson was greyed like a dove.
A few years back The Bulletin published
the portrait of a clever little youngster with
her face, all baby dimples, snuggled into an
adorable poke-bonnet. Here she is again—
Pauline Bind-
ley, who has

Adelaide drops a line or two:—
there has been a fine storm over our feminine
Young Person. According to someone, Policewoman
Kate Cocks said that a dragnet round this, village
would rope in only one respectable damsel in every
20; whereat the dailies were flooded with protests,
and the police lady hastened to explain that in a
discussion at which she was present, someone else
had quoted the one-in-twenty libel as an example of the
imbecile statements would-be reformers make. But.
in spite of this disavowal, the agitation still goes on.
The whole thing is typical of the nebulosity in
which so many “absolutely authentic’’ statements
have their roots.
The Varsity students’ annual frivol was, as usual,
split into two parts—the procession in the after-
noon and the concert at the Prince of Wales’s in the
evening. At the latter show one of the star items
was a “mystery play” by Verna Hackett, with the
authoress herself playing the lead, and Ethel Reid,
Ann Ross and three mere men to back her up.
The Con. students went gay for a night, too, stag-
ing their effort in the Elder Hall, with the staff
roped in to give them a hand. Indeed, it was almost
as much s-taff as students. Maude Puddy, whose
official r6le is that of a delightful pianist, showed
that she can hold her own as an amateur mummer
and writer of frivolous limericks with any one.
Mignon Weston, Muriel Prince, George Pearce and
Harold Parsons also took a hand; so did Director
Harold Davies himself.
At the serious business of the Commem., Chan-
cellor George Murray had a special posy to throw
at Gwendolen Ure, a damsel who has won the
David Murray prize twice and the Stow Prize four
times. The latter feat gives her the Stow Scholar-
ship—the first woman to hold it. Thelma Bleby
also had a special word—she has annexed the Bun-
dey poetry prize as a side-line to her LL.B., and is
the first law student to so distinguish herself.
The Girl Guides and Christmas jamborees have
been keeping Lady Bridges busy. The colors of
two North Adelaide companies were blessed in the
Anglican Cathedral the other afternoon, and the week-
end saw an investiture trip to Clare, where her
Ex. and Miss Judge were the guests of the S. H.
Ayerses. She went out to Unley, too, for the
Presbyterian Girls’ College prize-giving, and was at
the Creche on Pound Day to hand the kiddies their
presents from the Christmas tree.
The League of Nations has an offshoot here —
the All Nations Chums movement, which is designed
to train the younger generation to think well of the
League of Nations. Its president is Prof. Darnley
Naylor, and his daughter is the sec. (most of the
League’s success here is due to the work of this
family), and it gave a Christmas tree for its mem-
bers at the Osborne Hall the other afternoon. It
was a blazing day, but more than the 150 or so
expected turned up, and the small things in fancy
dress had the time of their lives.

Uses Rexona

MISS DOT BROWNE.
“I had a serious burn on my left
arm, which was scarred badly, so I
decided to try Rexona Ointment, and
in tw’o weeks my arm was completely
healed, and now you could scarcely
recognise that my arm was ever
burned so severely.”
MR. H. RICH.
“After suffering with Eczema and
spending pounds on many remedies
which gave me no relief, A used Rexona
Ointment, and it effected a complete
cure.”
MBS. HUTCHINGS.
“I had a bad leg for eight years, and
after six weeks’ treatment with
Rexona it was perfectly cured.”
Never a day passes but that
Rexona scores another triumph over
those serious troubles of life—Sores,
Bad Legs, Piles, Eczema, Pimples,
Blotches, Burns, Nasal Catarrh and
Rheumatism. The dainty little triangular pot of Rexona, the Rapid Healer, contains a
combination of the most curative, antiseptic, soothing and healing properties known to
science.
Rexona is the Skin Remedy of the Age, because it destroys the harmful germs that
may be present in a sore, pimple, or any abrasion of the skin, thus preventing any contagion
of the blood and at the same time causes a new, healthy skin to grow. Rexona immediately
reduces the inflammation and pain; it acts as a distinct stimulant to the pores of the skin
and sets up a healing action immediately that increases day by day.
Bad leg sores that have resisted every other treatment succumb almost immediately to
its wonderful influence, while for Piles there is nothing its equal.
Rexona Heals Rashes, Sores
and all Skin Eruptions.
Sometimes when you are at your wits end and feel that your effoits are a failure, a
friend can make the right suggestion and pull you through. Obstinate sores of long standing
reduce some unfortunate sufferers to despair. Remedy after remedy fails, and it seems
nothing will help, but you cannot have tried Rexona, for Rexona does not fail. All sores
should be cleansed once or twice a day with warm water and Rexona Soap. Rexona
Medicated Soap destroys germs and encourages the skin to healthy action. Then apply
a dressing of Rexona, the Rapid Healer. Inflammation will quickly subside, healthy new
skin will form, and the body begin to build up new flesh again. You have not given
yourself a fair chance until you have tried Rexona Soap and Rexona Ointment.
Rexona—Best for Bad Legs,
Piles, Eczema and Ringworm.
You cannot afford to take chances with any of these serious troubles. What you
want is a real, reliable remedy which is easily applied and can be depended upon to
heal quickly. Rexona fills this need. There is no better treatment than to get a tin of
Rexona, and apply this antiseptic healer night and morning. First wash the parts affected
with warm water and Rexona Medicated Soap, and then apply a little Rexona, binding with
a soft cloth when possible.
Rexona is a specially-prepared product, made especially to overcome such serious
troubles as these. Those who use Rexona will not be disappointed, for Rexona heals
rapidly and absolutely.
Rexona,
the Rapid
Healer.

Pteropod’s success at Canterbury Park on
Saturday was his third in three starts on Sydney
courses. Conceding 281 b. to Percy Miller’s filly,
Girton Girl, who was about the smartest two-year-old
in training at Randwick this time last year, he
broke her up in the first half-mile, and came on to
win by a length and a half from unlucky Molly
B (in receipt of 331 b.) and Popaway in lmin 13isec.
—splendid time for six furlongs on the Canterbury
Park track. Were he as good over eight furlongs
as he is over six, he would have been a fair thing
for the A.J.C. Villiers Stakes, in which he was
handicapped at Bst. 21b. But the gelded son of
Pteropus-Coreen has yet to show that he can get a
mile in good company. He failed in the Epsom with
7st. 51b., and, remembering that, Poison decided on
Tuesday to reserve him for the Carrington, in which
has Bst. 121 b. Horses with undeniable chances in
BEN CHAFFEY,
Y.A.T.C.
committeeman
and horseowner.
Saturday’s mile are
Julia Grey (9st.),
Note (Bst. 51b.), Pop-
uway (Bst. 21b.) and
Teremarau (7st. 31b.).
Note has been genu-
inely backed, and is.
doing well on the track,
but has a knack of
getting into trouble in
a big- field. On the
other hand, Julia Grey
ian take care of her-
self, however numerous
the company, and she
has been galloping in
rare style. Julia is
selected to win, with
Teremarau for a saver
in case anything hap-
pens to the other lady.
There are not many genuine stayers in the Summer
Cup. Kerryland (7st. 91b.) cannot be discarded
on recent form, although the last half-furlong may
trouble him, but this page has a preference for El
Dorado (7st. 31b.), who will be plugging on when
most of the others are stopping. As a three-year-
old, carrying 91b. ‘overweight, this beautifully-bred
stallion (he is by All Black —Auraria’s Daughter)
finished ahead of Bitalli, Sir Andrew and Mufti in
David’s Sydney Cup. When he ran a close second
to Comptroller in the A..T.C. Waverley Handicap,
14 furlongs, he was so sore that the stable didn’t
fancy him. This time he has satisfied liis trainer,
and whatever beats him should have his (or her)
number hoisted first. Others that may do well at
the Christmas meetings are Highlander, Sunstroke,
Lady Eva and Master Cagou.

Judged by recent failures when the good
oof was up, little Gungool is not the fill}- .she
was expected to develop into when she and Gracu-
lus cut something of a dash at Flemington in the
early Spring-. Gungool gave backers a good run
for their money in the Mentone Handicap last
Saturday, but a superior burst of speed was revealed
by Pengarie, who, like Gungool, had been chasing
Warwickshire and Nautical. Yet Pengarie, despite
a pretty performance under the minimum weight,
hardly strikes one as being so likely to figure in
a Boxing or New Year’s Day double as some that
finished behind the gelding at Mentone. Among
the also-rans was Jaekstaff on the 7st. 111 b. mai-k.
The old chap looked rather out of place in company
where Nautical carried only six pounds more.
Lilypond, favorite for the W.A.T.C.
Derby and second favorite for the Perth Cup, was
expected to start in the 10-furlongs Belmont Thousand
on Saturday, but his party belatedly decided to re-
serve him for his richer and less crowded engage-
ments. In the absence of the Lilyveil gelding, who
is regarded in Perth as another Easingwold, the race
proved a good thing for the favorite Eracre, by Lin-
acre-Mitraille, who was well clear of unlucky Sweet
Doris and Bronzine when Straker stopped riding.
The winner’s price with Dynamiteodds was 4 to 1,
but the totalisator paid just on 7’s straightout
and 7 to 2 for a place—this on an equal-division
machine. Were s.o. and place totes installed at
RRndwick, instead of the silly concession-betting
implements favored by the committee, a lot of the
odds-crampers permitted to take out licenses and to
uncivilly refuse ten-shilling bets would have to go
to work.

“0.K.”: If Spargo bought Unit at a four-
figure price, as was recently alleged, he is by this
time convinced that boxing is a safer game than
owning racehorses. Unit ruptured an intestine and
died hastily a week or two ago. He might have put
a foot in a hole on the track, and thus have broken
a leg ; or he might have lived to lose his form whilst
losing his owner a lot of money in bets; or he
might have dropped dead of unsuspected heart com-
plaint. As it was, the colt simply ruptured a bit
of his innards and closed the account that way.

“Pedro”: A story about Humphrey Oxen-
ham and the horse All Sorts has been told every way but
the right one, and that was related to me by
Oxenham himself. The late John Bennett, in his
day a famous man about town, went to Randwick
races, and found himself in a strange land. He
asked Oxenham for a tip on the next. “Well,” said
Oxey, “I don’t think you could do better than have
a bit on All Sorts.” John returned after the race
with a sheaf of betting tickets. “My word,” said
Oxenham, “you seem to have backed the whole
field, one at a time.” “But I only did what you
advised me,” Bennett protested. “Don’t you re-
member telling me to back all sorts?”
“Hori”: At an unregistered meeting in
N.-W. Queensland Scavenger and Doublegee were
racing ahead of the field. Down the straight they
came, locked together, and their jockeys enthusiasti-
cally flogging, not their mounts but each other.
Scavenger won by half a length, but Doublegee’s owner
successfully appealed on the ground of interference.
The inquiry was held in a bough-shed, and a member
of the committee explained afterwards how it was
assisted in ai'riving at its decision. “Doublegee,” he
said, “was owned by a woodcutter, and all the men
in the timber camp had put their shirts on it. What
would you have done if you’d seen half a dozen six-
foot axemen looking over the top and saying they
were ready to hop in at any moment? It didn’t
take us five minutes to give it to Doublegee.”
I said I would have given it to Doublegee too.
It rained heavily in Adelaide the night
before the N.S.W.-S.A. match began, and South vss
rejoiced when Murray won the toss from Coll' -.
But it wasn’t prepared for the failure of a side
which contained nine internationals, and a batsman
who is bound to be in the next Test team, to score
three figures. Certainly the ball cut capers on
the sodden pitch, but the collapse made people won-
der what will happen to the next Australian XI if
it strikes a wet season in England, where the
wickets are not covered and the bowling is of higher
quality than that of the S.A. trundlers, well as they
did. Scott, the Marrickville “express,” top-scored
with 15 n. 0., and Taylor (12) was shaping nicely when
he was thrown out. H. F. T. Heath, a Methodist
minister, who bowls left hand, got Collins, Macartney,
lvippax, Andrews and Kelleway for 4-3 ; and R. J.
B. Townsend, now somewhat of a veteran, took 4
for 33. Bowlev (33) and A. J. Richardson (16)
gave the home team a good start on a slightly im-
proved wicket, and Ambler hit merrily for another
16, but Kelleway (5 for 40) found a spot, and the
last wicket fell at 116 —18 runs ahead. The stars
did better in Ma State’s second innings, Andrews
contributing 47, Macartney 34, Taylor 33, Hendry
26, Kelleway 26 (he was very unfairly barracked
for being cautious when caution was justified) and
Kippax 20. But nine were out for 198 when play-
ceased on Saturday, and S. Aus.’s prospects looked
rosy, with the chance of a good wicket on
Monday and only Mailey to bat. However, Oldfield
and the slow bowler came to the rescue of N. S.
Wales. Batting with fine courage and freedom they
had put on 134 for the tenth wicket when rain
brought Monday’s proceedings to a close, and al-
though they only added one more on Tuesday-, the
tide was running strongly against the Wheat Staters
as this page rushed to the printer.

“Past Grammar”: D. Mullarkey, whose
130 against Queensland saved N.S.W. from defer,
made his bow in first-grade games last season. He
came up from the juniors in 1921, and had to
serve in the third and second grades before earning
his place in St. George’s first XI. Without being
a sticker Mullarkey is an ideal opening batsman,
and it looks as if he is destined to succeed Warren
Bardsley, who reached his 39th year a week before
his failure on Saturday, when things were going
badly for his side in Adelaide. Mullarkey played
centre-threequarter for the St. George League foot-
ball team last season.
“Matahari”: There are other rising hopes as
well as Mullarkey. Jim Garner, for example: he
made 209 (out of 337) for Uni, v. Central Cumber-
land, and that in 170 minutes. This season Garner
has an aggregate of 433 runs, averaging 61.85, and
has taken 21 wickets averaging 18.52. He, too, is a left-
hander. And there is Roy Bardsley, Warren’s brother,
who scored 188 for Western Suburbs v. Petersham.
Roy, who bats right hand, has made four centuries
in seven innings (aggregate, 584 ; average, 146), and
got 1 and 45 (second-top score) v. Queensland.
Another coming man is Steele of Marrickville, who
combines free hitting with a sound defence, and
whose cool confidence when his side is up against
it is very reminiscent of the young Clem Hill.
Adelaide’s only inter-collegiate cricket
match, St. Peter’s v. Prince Alfred, showed this
year a remarkable performance by the latter. At
lunch-time On the second day they apparently hadn’t
a chance, having lost their two best batsmen for
next to nothing in reply to a St. Peter’s total of
382 (Sangster 137 and Moorhouse 50). But the
other Princes played up (Alexander 81, W. W.
Evans 56), and finished only about 70 behind.
Then they put Saints out for 163, and, going in with
about 230 to win, made them for the loss of three
wickets (Hone 88, and M. Evans 123 u. 0.). for
the losing side Premier Barwell’s son hit a plucky
48 and 45, although hurt dux-ing the first innings.
“Winkle” : Warwick Armstrong is blamed
by some critics for the stodginess of contemporary
Y ictorian cricket. Though eminently successful, he
was a batsman of the defensive type and a bowler

who played for safety, so to speak. The colts of
yesterday, who are the Shield players of to-day, took
the big fellow as a model in each department, and, not
having his genius, make the game dreai-y for spec-
tators. N. S. Wales, on the other hand, has generally
had a punishing batsman like Trumper and Macart-
ney, and an enterprising bowler like Turner, Mc-
Kibbin and Mailey to guide the young fellows along
the path to .greatness, and for this reason her
cricket has never become a weariness of the flesh.
That is the theory, and I have heard it elaborated
more than once. My own opinion is that Melbourne
colts are not sufficiently coached. There was a time
when grounds were always busy on practice nights
with cricketers striving to improve. Everywhere
you could see wise old players instructing eager young-
sters. Nowadays px-actice is a bore. The stars, when
they do come, have but 10 minutes at the nets
before they “imshi,” and the lads, left to develop
themselves, take the sate and pottering path
that pleases a captain thinking only of the result of
Satterdee’s match. There are no Harry Grahams
coming on in Victoria.
“Last Grammar” : “Nitric” (B. 13/32/'23)
fell into a pit of his own digging when he con-
tradicted my statement that Lawton seas to play
five-eighth lor Oxford. The Queenslander played
in that position, and was a big factor in Oxford's
21-14 victory over Cambridge at Twickenham. He
scored a try and converted three others, besides
helping Johnny Wallace, oxice of Sydney Uni., to
cross the line. The influence of the Rhodes scholars
on Oxford Rugger is shown in the composition of
the Dark Blue side. Besides Lawton, A. C. Wallace
(N.S.W.), M. Humphey (S. Africa), G. McDonald
(S. Africa), A. Shaeknovis (S. Africa), Van Den-
tine (Pennsylvania, U.S.A.), and T. Sheron (S.
Africa) were in the fifteen.
“Centurion”: “Nitric” (B. 13/12/’ 23) must be
something of an amateur in Rugby, otherwise he
would never have confused, as he did in his par.
about Lawton, the wing-forward and the breakaway.
The first is not a forward at all, except in name;
the second is an adjunct of the all-impoi‘tant pack
first, and, the ball once dealt with, has a special
commission to go after it. Typical wing-forwards
cf the past were “Offside” McKenzie (M.L.) and
Fred Henlen (N.S.W.). Beilis, who was over here
with the last All Blacks, is a modern example.
These men never went into the pack ; they stood up
bv the side of it and perhaps put, a hand on the
nearest scrummager, to placate the referee. That
was about all they did in the way of forward play.
The rest of their game was fighting the opposite
man and carrying illegal offside play as far as they
could without incurring a “send off.” The break-
away does not leave the pack until the ball is in
plav from the scrum. Then he goes up with his
backs, or gets, first of his comrades, on to the
opposition. # #
“.Tacky Koo” : A. C. Wallace, the N.S.W.
Rhodes Scholar and footballer, has also experienced
the baffling Oxford habit of playing a man out of
his place (B. 6/12/’23). Since he left the S.G.S.,
Wallace has made a name for himself as about the
surest centre in England, yet the Oxford skipper
has consistently played him as full-back or wing-
three-quarter. ’That he was able to gain a blue and
an International cap while performing in an unsuit-
ab’e position goes to show what a brilliant foot-
baller he is. “Past Grammar” asks what the
trouble is. From all I saw (and I was turning out
pretty regularly in Scotland last year) I connect it
with the ridiculous prejudice against overseas
players representing England, Scotland and Wales
in international trials or games. The Scottish XV
is continually drawing on overseas players; and the
question of their qualifications is raised at frequent
intervals, without any decision being arrived at. To
question a footballer’s right to represent the country
his parents came from strikes me as being- the
worst kind of snobbishness a “Colonial” can bump
against in England.

In the third round of his encounter with
the Belgian Dupont at Sydney Stadium, Eddie
Butcher feinted with his right, hurled fiis left at
the .chin, and knocked the stranger dreaming of
Flanders and the fair Fleming of whom he is
enamored. For it is now related of Henri, to account
for his non-success in Sydney, that he is home-
sick and a bit love-sick withal. There is no such
sentimental stuff in the Westralian’s composition.
When liis young thoughts wander from the matter
in hand they concentrate on the size of the “gate.”
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Tlie dramatic critic of
a blameless Sydney daily once had a brief intrusion
into sporting journalism. He was sent to intei--
view the winner of the Laiig-Squires argument, and
he did it—that is to say, he listened in a dazed
way while the conqueror spun an ingenuous narra-
tive concerning bashes on the smeller, crosses on the
point, and uppercuts on the Darby Kel. “An’ ’e
came at me again, and I ups and chins, ’im, and
down ’e goes, fiat out,” said Bill o’ Yarx-aside. “I
see,” said the critic faintly. “It sounds most
unpleasant.” Whenever Bill—now a Bung in Mel-
bourne —-recalls the incident he becomes a critic
himself. “Gripes!” is his comment.
“Snow” : Having used up all the available
Eurasians and Filipinos, the genus pi-omoter is
importing a Malay to swap punches with the home-
grown pug. Of course, the impending- arrival is
champion of lvwala Kangsa, or some such place, and
it goes without saying that he possesses “all the fero-
city and cunning of his race.” Whether a jolt on the
bread basket will cause the imminent savage to- curl
up, as it does the Manilaman, who is pathetically
vulnerable in that quarter, is not stated. Anyhow,
the fact —if it is a fact—wouldn’t chill the enthusiasm
of the mugs who roll up to see black, brown and
saffron lift purses, principally as losers, that would
have made Griffo, Dooley, Dawson, Jim Hall, Cree-
don and Billy Murphy think they were millionaires.

“S.T.” : The A.L.T.A. has asked the tennis
States to rank their players. In South Oss Thomas,
Hone, Rowe, Garner, Penny and the new man Solo-
mon figure in that order. Among the women Miss
Le Messurier has displaced Mrs. Rowe, with Mrs.
Hack third. Stuart, who was good enough a year
ago to be asked whether he could go with the Davis
Cup team if wanted, is not ranked at all. S.A.
leaves him out because he is now living in Mel-
bourne, and Vic. because he has only just come from
Adelaide.
* * * *
•“35-30” : Officially ranked for the first
time, Victoria’s leading tennis players are Patterson,
OTlara Wood, Hawkes, Schlesinger, Mclnnes and
Wertheim, in that order, followed bv 14 others
in the pennant class. The ancient Rainey occupies
eighth position, and is closely pursued by Rolland,
another veteran, who had his heyday 13 years ago.
After these comes a bunch of men who faithfully
appear among the also-rans of the tournaments, and
will continue to do so, dropping back a little year
by year, until self-consciousness dawns upon them
and thev retire to some committee or take to
bowls. The infrequency of new faces in the singles
and doubles championships is a revelation of the
slowness with which the juniors are coming on.
Young Ben Dunlop was a schoolboy crack two or
three years ago, but hasn’t done anything since to
excite attention. The real trouble,' of course, is
that Victoria has two or three top-notchers, whose
nide health and almost invariable excellence secure
their selection for every inter-State argument, to
the exclusion of young triers. In the N. S. Wales
team which came to Melbourne recently there were
three young fellows—Kalnxs and the Willard brothers
—who played in Victoria for the first time. The
previous ‘year Aubrey- Sieler made his debut in the
southern capital, and 1 have no doubt that the pro-
gressive policy- of the Ma State Association in giving
the youngsters a show will prove of great benefit
in the long run. Another thing is that the Svdney
selectoi's make room for a rural aspirant if he
reveals any ability, but I have never heard of a
Victorian team that went further for its personnel
than the wilds of South Yarra and Toorak.
“35-30”: Tennis-players on this side pro-
fess to be heartened by the rumor that William
Johnston, of California, has played his last Davis
Cup contest. He has been Tilden’s partner in four
consecutive finals, but his defeat by Anderson and
his failure to capture a set from’ Tilden in the
National singles at Philadelphia have convinced
some critics that he is on the down grade. The
New York Herald reports that his match with
Tilden was an ignominious dance to the other Bill’s
tune. Johnston’s famous cross-court lunge was in
need of repairs, and his friends turned pale at his
pile of errors. All the same, I have the feeling
that William will be on deck again next year,
with his game again in good trim. His losses this
season happened towards the end of an unusually
severe programme. In Paris and London he out-
fought all opposition in the hard-court and grass
championships, and he was busily engaged in America
before he faced Andei'son at Forrest Hills. The
chances are that he, overdid it and went stale.
In any case, Johnston has proved that he is definitely
superior to Hunter and Richards, who are next to
him on the American ranking list. If he did drop
out, Australia’s chances of lifting the Cup in 1924
would be greatly increased—that is, assuming our
team included Anderson or Patterson and O’Hara
Wood.
The two rifle-shots from S.A. to get into
the Australian team for Bisley are Addison, of
Orroroo, and Hall, of Adelaide. Addison is a 21-
year-old son of Walter Addison, of Orroroo, the
only Australian who ever won the King’s prize at
Bisley, and a grandson of an M.L.C. who did much
for rifle-shooting in his time. Hall was manager
of the S.A. team which won the Commonwealth
match in Perth in 1921. His shooting started with
the Register club in 1898.
The four-oared N.S.W. championship on
the Parramatta went to the Mosman crew—A.
Pfafflin (flow), H. L. Callaghan, J. B. Evans and
C. B. Oallasrhan (strpkej—for the third successive l
year. But Di-ummoyne gave them a good go, and
a ferry-boat contributed a thrill by upsetting the
umpire’s launch. Nobody was hurt, but the
officials got a ducking and some juniors lost their
togs.
SNOOKERED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He snookered me! Had he not been so smart
I should have won for sure the tournament;
His evil craft upset my apple-cart,
All round appreciative chuckles went.
I might have stood it if he’d pinched my tart;
But this, I frankly tell you, I resent.
Just when within my grasp was victory,
Just when uncatchable I seemed to be,
He snookered me!
He left me—d —n him ! —underneath the wall
And in the pocket’s crook. With maniac
Eyes I surveyed my plight. There wasn’t a ball
Offering the barest chance except tile black,
It seemed to me. My soul was filled with gall,
Round cushions four (at least) 1 needs must smack
To score a hit and dodge the penalty.
Who could so tight a place as this foresee?
He’d snookered me.
He’d queered my pitch. Mayhap some super-man,
Some Gray or Walter Lindrum with a cue,
Might have frustrated his insidious plan,
But it was more,'alas ! than 1 could do.
I struck. My ball around the table ran
And finally collided with the blue.
He smiled; the benches voiced amusement free.
1 was “the dripping roast” in simile.
He snookered me!
Had it been billiards —beaten fair and square
I wouldn’t have grudged it to my conqueror;
No hardness I’d have cherished, I declare,
Had I encountered him in love or war
And come off second-best. But still I swear
When I recall it, even as 1 swore
When it occurred. 1 was ahead by three,
And suddenly, to put me up a tree,
He snookered me!

THE INKY WAY.
“Jacky Roo”: “Stroller” (B. 29/11 /’23) asks for
a literary prize open to any man or woman in the
Commonwealth. He has it in the Rupert Brooke
Memorial Prize (founded by the trustees of the
Presbyterian Ladies’ College, Melbourne), which is
open to anyone with a five years’ residence in Aus-
tralia. It is worth 25 guineas, and this year the
subject was a one-act play. David McKee Wright
won it the first year with his “Gallipoli.”
“Rotide”: The Australian Ad. Men’s Convention
the other day voiced a pious preference for Aus-
tralian manufactures, and expressed a commendable
intention of inducing people to buy none other.
Hooray! For a start, will the ad.-men abstain from
lifting and adapting slogans, type matter and illus-
trations from foreign magazines and papers, and em-
ploy Australian writers and picture makers to manu-
facture their requirements? There will be a good
few thousands a year more to be picked up on the
Inky Way if they will.
“Podsnap”: Now that the Melbourne Sun is
again throwing money about in an endeavor to secure
the loveliest siren on the beaches, the Herald has
followed up with a similar scheme, with a larger
and wider range of prizes, and craftily attempts to
queer its reptile contemporary by announcing that
every picture forwarded must be sent exclusively to
it. Since the Herald’s first prize is £5OO, as com-
pared with the Sun’s £4OO, and the older sheet
is promising coin in other directions, the Herald
should get a majority of the real beauties. The
joke of the whole thing, however, is that the con-
test was jocularly suggested to either, or both, by
Truth —a paper to which they would scorn to
acknowledge their indebtedness for anything.
“Hamer”: The space that the daily press gives to
certain criminals is treasured as if it was a certifi-
cate of merit. I know one who keeps a
book of press-cuttings, and is as proud of it
as ever was mummer of his newspaper mentions.
When that tough Surry Hills combination known as
the Forty Thieves was most active I did a special
for an evening paper in which 1 spoke of “the most
vicious gang Sydney lias seen since the old push
days of 30 years ago.” A few nights later, prowl-
ing in the same district, 1 was only saved from a
rough handling by one of the Thieves exclaiming:
“Hold on! This is the bloke that wrote about us! ’
Afterwards I was embarrassed by the determination
of some of the push to buy me drinks.
“Hermes”: The Australian War Museum must
surely have a more representative collection of
soldiers’ magazines and Digger publications than
that claimed by “Wilfrido” for the Turnbull Library
(M.L.). Among the tremendous lot are Aussie,
All Abaht It (10th Field Ambulance), Astra
(3rd Div. Train), Barrak (Camel Corps Review),
Bran Mash (4th Light Horse), Cacolet (Camel
Field Ambulance), Ca ne Fait Rein (6th Bn),
Deesweet Despatch (18th B’n), Desert Dustbin
(3rd L. H. Field Ambulance), First Aid Post (And
Field Ambulance), Boomerang (Ist Aust. Aux.
Hospital), Jackass (Ist Aus. Gen. Hospital), The
Stretcher (Camel Brigade Field Ambulance), Two
Blues fl3th B’n), and Ye ChAtte (3rd field
Ambulance). A large number of transport souvenirs
are held also.
“G.R.”: H. W. Stewart’s remarks on syndicated
and lifted copy (B. 15/11/’23) incite me to com-
plaint. Most of the larger Australian papers print
columns of lifted stuff, the only clue to the ‘Tift
being ail insignificant “says the So-and-So” hidden
away in the body of the article. Not long since the
London Daily Mail paid me two guineas for in
article. Six weeks later I read the thing in an
Adelaide daily with the buried tag, “says a writer
in the Daily Mail.” And this despite the fact
that the firm of literary agents in London which
sells my stuff is careful to dispose only of the
British rights. According to an article by Herbert
Thring. Secretary of the Society of Authors, in the
July Writer, “to quote the whole” is an infringe-
ment of copyright. But with a great paper on one
side and a poor devil of a writer on the other, what
has the great paper to fear?
“T.R.H.”: Yarns about John Norton (B. l/11/’23)
remind me that he threw his inkbottle at me a few
days before he crossed Jordan. At the time I used
to help with the Melbourne copy. One Tuesday
I walked into the chief sub.’s room in Little Lons-
dale-street and found, instead of my old friend
Peter Thompson, the proprietor of the paper wife
his head in his hands. “What the hell do you
want?” “I’ve brought in my copy.” “To Hell
with copy and you too!” Bang Went the big ink-
bottle through a glass partition. But Norton was
a good fellow 7 when sober, especially to Lancashire
men. At ope time he edited the Manchester Spy.
On one of his visits to London he sent in his card
to Labouchere (ed. of London Truth) at the House
of Commons. The waiter returned and told Norton
“Labby” could not see him. Norton wrote on his
card, “I am the proprietor and editor of Australian
Truth,” and sent it up a second time. It came
back with the addendum “That is why I will hot
see you.”
“Sturt”: Adelaide Uni. has made a small but signi-
ficant alteration in the regulations governing the
award of its annual prize for poetry. When Miss
E. M. Bundey (daughter of the old-time Judge)
established it 10 years ago, it was regulated on the
old-fashioned lines of English ’Varsity tradition,
being called a “prize for English verse,” candi-
dates were required to hand in a long poem on a
set subject. Young Australians don’t take easily
to that kind of exercise, and Prof. Henderson, whose
pet child the scheme was, had to decide for some
years that nothing sent in was worth an award. At
last Leon Gellert, just back from the w'ar, turned
in a hatch of short pieces reflecting his experience
on Gallipoli, in hospital and after, and they were so
good that they had to get an award, legally quali-
fied or not. Latterly' the set subject has been broad-
ened to some vague theme such as Love or Patriot-
ism ; and nOw the condition is to read “poem or
poems,” a tardy admission that a bunch of lyrics or
sonnets can be just as valuable as a long-winded epic
oi ode.
THE PAINTER AND THE POET.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“If art can present the undraped figure without
incurring odium, why not literature?”— “L.G.D.”
(«. 29 / 11. /’23).
Keith Easel in his studio knows
The way with brush and chromo
To tear aside the veil that clothes
And modesty (or shame) impose
Upon the genus homo.
His Eves from canvas boldly stare
(By Art’s decree exempted
From blame) as radiantly rare
As Eden’s pioneering pair
Before the Serpent tempted.
And louder eulogists enthuse,
And wowser protests fainter
Grow day by day, while glib reviews
The doctrine far and wide diffuse:
Be Rabelaisian as you choose
As long as you’re a painter!
Sam Inkpen plies the poet’s trade,
And when he’s at his lyring
He finds in Beauty Unarrayed
To metric ecstasy an aid
That’s equally inspiring.
But woe to him if he should hint,
While weaving fancy’s figments,
At nudities in chilly print
Which Easel, without let or stint,
Portrays in glowing pigments.
Painters may morals disregard,
Nor find the world censorious,
But for a tithe as much a bard
Would find his reputation marred,
His verses hoist bv the petard
Index Expurgatorius.

At Sydney Theatre Royal Desdemona
Champion is having her weasand slit for
the last time, in accordance with Shaks-
pearean regulations, by Othello Asche. On
Saturday night “The Spanish Main” will
roll in, bearing with it a merry noise of
yo-ho-ing and a strong flavor of Jamaica
rum.
“The Silver Fox” went to earth at Syd-
ney Cri. last night after a fast and enjoyable
run. On Saturday Irene Vanbrugh and
Dion Boucicault, with a company of certified
merit, will present Pinero’s “His House in
Order.”
“A Southern Maid” is still de-luxing at
Her Majesty’s, Sydney. If the last-but-one
Poet Laureate could have lived to see it he
would surely have re-written the “Lotus-
Eaters” to find room in it for such charm-
ing pieces of femininity as Gladys Moncrieff
and Cecil Bradley.
MELBOURNE TIVOLI.
June Mills, “the ton of fun ” in her famous
avalanche act.
Of all that is happening at this moment
on Melbourne stages only “Sally,” at the
Royal, will be happening on Saturday. At
three houses where hideous noises of
preparation are now vehement, a triumphant
paan of achievement will take up the run-
ning on the 22nd. "Sally” is to serve all
Christmas holiday purposes at the Royal,
and will commence the second year of her
Australian life on Jan. 5.
Saturday’s fierce heat was no doubt
responsible for the falling off in the
Repertory audience at the Sydney Con-
servatorium. The society presented a
double bill, of which Gordon Bottom-
ley's poem-drama, “King Lear's Wife.”
was the curtain-raiser, and Galsworthy's
“Windows” the three-acter. The cur-
tain-raiser is a piece of good writing;
and without exception the characters rose
to the beauty of the lines. But it is a pity
not to drop the curtain on the scene in
which Merryn tells the king she lias mur-
dered Gormflaith. The re-introduction of
the corpse-washers, though excellent reading,
is stage bathos. In “Windows” the players
were again so good that it is not easy to
say where the cast could have been strength-
ened. Stella Marina, as the fate-battered
heroine, lived all the varying moods of the
eager, thwarted little housemaid who wanted
to be happy and loved. Gene Magnus, the
daughter Mary of the idealistic March
household, was another of the evening’s sur-
prises ; and the difficult subtlety of Johnny
March's poetic nature was faithfully con-
veyed by G. Kelly. Erna Living. Eleanor
Ross and Harold Watch and S. R. Irving
were strong supports.
Harry Musgrove has secured the, Hippo-
drome lor the purpose of introducing young
Sydney to “The Forty Thieves” —not the
same forty that their fathers meet: that lot
will have shut up their time-payment land-
sab' offices and gone into temporary retreat.
Bert Harrow and the Hanlon Brothers have
been lifted from the Tivoli circuit, and with
such well-known “dead certs” as Jack Can-
not and Kitty Reidy and a living image of
artist J. C. Bancks’s Ginger Meggs, the
panto, should leave the post on Saturday
with a jump.
The lighted match that will set “Rockets”
soaring into the crowded atmosphere of new
Christmas attractions will, be applied at
Sydney Grand Opera House on Saturday
night; and in the shower of stars that will
ensue Lorn a and Toots Pounds will shine
with an extra special brilliance.
Sydney Tivoli’s paying guests are receiv-
ing a little of their money back this week
in the shape of cake passed around by Monty
Wolf and Irene Magley in a strenuous en-
deavor to popularise the latest tin-can fool-
rhyme which exhorts the listener to “Cut
Yourself a Slice of Cake and Make Your-
self at Home.” It is rumored that a half-
sovereign lies hidden in one of the slices,
and although there is a spread of gold-fever
among the audience there is no marked in-
crease in applause for the entertainers. Robb
Wilton continues to demonstrate in a re-
strained yet effective way that, even if the
Law wasn’t an ass, its blue-uniformed, large-
footed guardians would make it seem one.
Long Tack Sam and his troune of pig-tailed
jugglers and dancing-maids are again put-
ting in good work; and Will Quintrell re-
tains his control over an orchestra which is
a constant source of gratification to the dis-
criminating.
“Backbone,” which occupies the better
half of the Sydney Lyceum bill, is a chilly
affair; the story needs soleing and heeling,
and the scenery is desolate. The underlying
motive of it all is to bring yet another
male super-vamp under the pencilled eye-
brows of the flappers. “The Romany,” on
the same bill, is a better picture: it gives a
not too grim picture of gypsy life. The
Rialto is enticing Stadium seat-warmers to
give the once-over to a tortoise-motioned
film of the Dempsey-Firpo and the Dempsey-
Gibbous mills, and form their own opinions
as to who really won the bouts. “Fog-
bound,” with Dorothy Dalton in the leading
role, is giving the Strand’s customers ammu-
nition to use against the prohibitionists.
Also, Viola Dana is worth seeing in “Crino-
line and Romance,” an old-fashioned pic-
ture of Carolina. Hoyt’s trump card is
“The Dangerous Age,” a tale of the things
that are likely to happen if the wedding
chains chafe while the blood is still hot.
At Melbourne King’s there will be a con-
tinuance of Emelic Polini (late of Her
Majesty’s), but with a change of bill and
a considerable enlargement of company. In
the curtain-raiser, “A Night at an Inn,” the
horrors of the situation devolve upon Frank
Harvey, Brampton, Fernside and others of
the old brigade ; but in “French Leave” the
company will include Garry Marsh, Leslie
Holland, Brett and Annie Hughes as chief
assistants to Miss Polini and Harvey.
** * *
Saturday’s panto, at Melbourne Majesty’s
will be “Aladdin,” with Ada Reeve as the
boy in the name-part, and a list of other
attractions as long as the arm of coinci-
dence.
“Mother Goose,” with Dorothy Brunton
and Ileslop as new Christmas figures, will
be pantomime at Hugh Ward’s Mel-
bourne house, the Palace. Among many im-
pressive announcements a list of “amazing
prices” commands great attention.
“Little Nellie Kelly” is coming in to Mel-
bourne Princess’s, and from the local dic-
tionary the word “fail” has been expunged
with musical honors. Little Ellen is no

panto., but a perfect lady, though she is said
to be dancing all the time. And that is the
mood Melbourne wants them in just now.
Dancing all the time !
5? * * *
At Melbourne Playhouse, where “Hansel
and Gretel” has been long in rehearsal, the
bounding form of Hope looms a lot larger
than the lean figure of Probability. Yet one
never knows. If an Australian grand opera co.
has a chance to make the neighboring Yarra
blaze at Yuletidc, no better bill than “Han-
sel and Gretel” could be tried. Frank Rigo
has nailed his energies to the scheme, and
the co. is said to be forming a repertoire.
Near by, at Wirths’ Olympia, our old friend
William Anderson invites attention to his
coming show. Anderson’s panto., “Robinson
Crusoe,” is to start at the matinee on Boxing
Day, and owing to providential circumstances
two real baby elephants will appear on
Crusoe’s island.
This week Norma Talmadge is a ghost of
a ghost in “Smilin’ Through,” at Hoyt’s,
Melbourne. The spooky drama, in which
Gertrude Elliott’s honeyed soprano was
heard, seems not less maudlin in its romantic
intention with the agreeable little Talmadge
in charge of affairs. Dorothy Dalton has a
big contract in “Fog Bound,” on the same
programme. As the sweet one of a young
man who is accused of murdering her papa,
a revenue officer, she has to make a pretence
of hounding the lad to justice. The end is
a triumph of bootlegger sentiment. At
Hoyt’s Gaiety the recent meeting between
Messrs. Dempsey and Firpo is filling every
available seat. A yelling crowd follows the
darting shadow of a fist in an attempt to
realise what the substance may mean. The
author of “Little Wild Cat,” at the Majes-
tic, treads softly in the footsteps of Bernard
Shaw in transforming a slum mignonne into
a vivid social success. The same house is a
refuge for “The Man from Glengarry,” a
lumber-camp tale with a set of standardised
types from the Ralph Connor factory. “The
Bohemian Girl” is keeping a date at the
Britannia, and. though the Melba’s attrac-
tion is called “Custard Cup,” it is, meta-
phorically speaking, more in the nature of
hash.
Moist heat has made things unpleasant
for indoor shows in Adelaide. But Nellie
Bramley, with a mixed co. at the Royal, is
doing good work in a lot of old successes,
ranging from the bedroom-door-smashing
drama, through the young-ladyisli “Peg o’
My Heart,” to the severely practical “Third
Degree.” At the Majestic the “Flying Tor-
pedo” is the most thrilling item, and the
Tully sisters offer some sound though un-
conventional music. Open air has the best
of it. At the Exhibition Grounds, in a Wil-
liamson co.. operatic extracts are a marked
feature (Cade conducting), while Elton
Black and Billy Maloney supply most of
the fun. In a similar show at Austral Bar-
dens Moon and Morris are the backbone,
but Jimmy Taylor has an effectively quaint
style. In pictures, “Main Street,” at West’s,
brings a fairly practical demonstration of
American small-town life, the York makes
an unwarranted fuss over Robert Chambers’s
“Common Law,” and Wondergraph has a
funny show in which an insurance co. works
hard to get Agnes Ayres married to put an
end to its covenanted risks.
“Nella”: Whether the cinema version of
“A Bill of Divorcement” is an outrage on
Clemence Dane’s story or not, it is a telling
picture. It is artistically produced and the
acting is done by mostly-British players.
Constance Binney is starred because she has
the imprimatur of Yankee filmdom, but the
real star, both in importance to the story
and in outstanding artistry, is Fay Comp-
ton. In sober truth the picture makes the
machine-made Yankee film-story look like
what it is, banal tripe.
t “Norbell”: Regarding the superiority of
Nellie Stewart, Ipaurctte Taylor or Julia
Neilson as Sweet Nell (B. 22/11/'23)
there is this to be said. When Nellie Stew-
art took her Australian co. to the U.S.A.
in December. ’O5, “Sweet Nell” had been
done there often: yet, playing in a despised
Frisco theatre, she captured the town. The
Evening Post critique ran to three and a
half columns and contained this: —
She lias a magnetic, gripping power....lt is this
personality, this magnetism that will win success
for Miss Stewart all over the United States.
The prediction was fulfilled.
“Poliutu”: Years ago, while waiting for
a night train at Kaitangata (M.L.), 1 saw
an act of that atrocity, “The Man They
Couldn’t Hang.” A day or two later I read
in a Dunedin paper that a Kaitangata Maori
had gone out by the rope route. Having
gathered from the play that strangulation
could be frustrated by developing the neck-
muscles. Hen arc began rehearsing, with the
idea of giving exhibitions at country shows.
He started early in the morning, using a
tree, a halter and a stool. The rehearsal
became a first and last night when a goat
knocked the stool over and left Henarc with
his feet dangling about two feet from the
ground. He was still there when the local
J. Hop arrived with a notebook and the
undertaker with his tape-measure.
“Flyman” : I mentioned the death of Alfred
Clint to my old friend Splodger, and that
started it:—
“I ‘splodged’ hundreds of acres of cloth for him in
my time, but times was different then. In them
days plays was plays. W’y, I remember Alf Dampier
puttin’ on a piece with seven acts .and 27 scenes.
They was ’ardly any room for the actors to get on
an’ off—they had to edgel along sideways. Nowadays
two or three cloths and a barrerload of furnicher,
and they call it a drummer. No explosions or ships
a-fire or real floodgates or tanks —nothin’ like them.
D’yer remember ‘The World,’ an’ ‘Romany Rye,’
an’ ‘’Arbor Lights’ ? They was plays. W’y, w’en
the curtain shot up and the ’ands went out for a
drink and a smoke, you’d think it was the theatre
cornin’ out. Where kin you see a play like ‘’EM
by the Enemy’ now, with the guns batterin’ down

THE PICNIC.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Down in the gully peewits cull,
And chequered sunlights lightly fall
Upon the paper serviette.
The trees are lattice for the blue,
The soft leaf shadows flutter through,
The grassy table’s set.
The little old black billy sings,
And up about it merry rings
Of blue gum smoke are wreathing;
The wildflowers crushed beneath our feet,
Make all the bright air fragrant-sweet
For happy breathing.
We laugh and talk, and tea is made;
And (l have known it) unafraid,
A little ’possum comes to see.
Beyond the hills and over there
We know there is a world somewhere,
But not for you and me.
For we’ve found love in lovelier places,
And the world’s words and the world’s faces
Are not so bright as these.
And when life aches and the world’s broken,
We shall find kindness all unspoken
Here from the good bush trees.
The twilight falls : the song is sung,
High up the silver moon is young;
The dusk’s her lover.
We pack the things with no word said ;
Homeward the lagging path we tread.
Another picnic’s over.

Oscar Asche writes :
“Thersites” (B. 13/12/’23) asks' me why I deliver
Othello’s great .speech in the Senate scene with my
back turned to the Duke. I give him the lie direct.
I address the Duke and the Senators facing them,
and I do not stand with my back to the Duke.
The speech, if he will refer to his Shakspeare,
begins, “Most potent, grave and reverend signiors.”
They are not all sitting on one seat, and the speech
is spoken sometimes facing the Duke and sometimes
facing the Senators. I believe counsel sometimes
faces the jury and not always the Judge alone.
As regards the criticism that I kill Desdemona by
stabbing her, “Thersites” says that the lines,
“Yet I’ll not shed her blood, nor scar that whiter
skin of hers than snow,” point to another death.
This is a stereotyped mistake often made by people
who study their Shakspeare without very much in-
telligence. The lines he quotes are spoken when
Othello first comes into the bedchamber, when he is
going to commit a “sacrifice” and not a “murder.”
Desdemona’s denials, however, heat his blood, and
he strangles her with his hands as advised by lago
in the text of the fourth act. But finding that she
is not dead, Othello exclaims, “I would not have
thee linger in thy pain: So, so.” This clearly points
to an application of the dagger and certainly not
to another attempt at strangling or smothering.
Were Desdemona to recover from strangling suffi-
ciently to speak the lines set down for her by Shaks-
peare she would recover completely; but the blood-
letting sets the blood coursing through her veins
again and she is able to speak. Eventually she dies
of blood-letting. Next, please!
“Norbell”: Say wliat you will, the audi-
ence loves the old gags best. The more blue-
mouldy they are the better they go, like
some kinds of cheese. The comedians know
this very well, and seldom venture a wheeze
other than a time-honored chestnut. That
is probably why Arthur Stigant in “A South-
ern Maid” explains a long way after Kipling
that “a woman is only a woman, but a good
cigar is a smoke.” No melodrama is quite
de rigueur unless the villain threatens the
funny man by saying, “If you do so-and-so
I’ll cut out your tongue,” to which the comic
rejoins, “If you do I’ll never speak to you
again.” I was reminded of this at “Othello”
when Roderigo remarked, “I will incon-
tinently drown myself,” to which lago re-
plied, “Well, if thou dost, I shall never love
thee after.” I wonder where Shakspeare
pinched it.
“0.K.”: Another inveterate card-player
who thought he could hold his own with
past-masters of the pack (B. 6/12/’23) was
the late J. C. Williamson. J.C.W. was a
mark for cardsharpers aboard-ship or at
hotels. His impassivity at the table made
him dangerous in ordinary company, but in
extraordinary company he was the mug. On
one crossing from New York to London he
was hacl for about £2OOO.
“F.A.”: Handel’s “Messiah,” recently
produced at Sydney Town Hall by the Phil-
harmonic Society, under Joseph Bradley’s
baton, was first rendered by the Phil, at the
Masonic Hall, York-street, in July, 1859.
F. H. Lavenu, a Melbourne conductor,
rimmed that show into shape, though he
iimself was a physical wreck at the time.
He died a week later while conducting the
first Australian performance of “II Trova-
tore” at the Prince of Wales’s, which stood
on the site now occupied by the Royal.
“C.J.A.”: Alex. F. Lithgow, the Launces-
ton (Tas.) bandmaster (B. 22/11/’23), is a
compositor as well as a composer. He served
his time on the Southland Times (M.L.),
and some of the marches now popular with
bands in various parts of the world—par-
ticularly in the U.S.A., where they have been
shamelessly pirated—were roughed out while
he was slinging type. As a youth of 20 he
won the solo cornet championship of M.L.,
and a couple of years later he did it again.
Bert Frost, brother of Sydney organist
Lilian, is lending a hand in Lithgow’s orches-
tral venture as organist, secretary and
treasurer—all honorary.
“G.A.C.” : The Brisbane theatrical drought
isn’t going to be so severe this summer as
it threatened to be. The Reynolds-De Tisne
co., which held sway at the Royal for almost
a year, has patched up its differences, and
opened at Ilis Majesty’s in “The Squaw
Man,” with De Tisne in the role in which
the flappers loved Charles Waldron a decade
ago. They are to be there for about three
months, if all goes well. Claude Dampier,
with Hilda Attenboro and other clever people,
has walked in at the Royal; and at Bohemia,
though the Bluetts have gone south to appear
in panto., the quality of the little show keeps
well up, with Laszlo Schwartz, fiddler and
half a dozen other things, at tlio helm.
“Santander” : Dion Bbucicault would have
improved his production of “The Second Mrs.
Tanqueray” in Melbourne by more careful
casting of the minor parts. Ellean’s young
siveetheart, who was supposed to be a purple
blotch on Paula’s record, was not even phy-
sically credible: Fastened to a mo. which
didn’t fit him, lie w T as a saddening reflection
on Paula’s taste in husbands. And
the barmaidenly effulgence of Lady Orreyd
wrns surely not what P(nero intended. She
looked as if her favorite menu w r as shrimps
and ’arf-an’-’arf; and her husband suggested
a drink-sodden butler in a third-rate farce.
No nobleman ever carried his liquor in such
a patently artificial manner.
“Shay”: A recent reference to the chair-
man in the late-Victorian music-hall recalled
to me the old Stag’s Head Hotel at the East-
terrace end of Rundle-street, Adelaide. The
bar led into a long room or hall, the body
of which contained tables and forms, and
there was a stage. On Saturday nights a
show wrns given, and between turns waiters
moved about, crying, “Orders, gentlemen!
Orders, please!” I frequented the Stag in
1890; it was then, I believe, the last surviv-
ing free-and-easy in Australia. There is a
tradition that it was kept by a man who
had run the historic Flower Pot in Birming-
ham.
“Norbell” : I know a man who says he has
endured 33 different Lady Isabels. Apropos,
H. Chance Newton (“Oarados” of London
Referee) boasts of having survived 60
Othellos. Among them he names Phelps,
Charles Dillon, W. H. Pennington, Hermann
INDUSTRIOUS.
ARTIST : “Yes, I’m in the moving-picture
line now.”
FRIEND: “Doing any good at it?”
ARTIST: “Well, it’s cheaper than paying
rent.”
Vezin, Bandmann, Henry Forrester, Edwin
Booth, Matlieson Lang, Frank Cooper, Asche,
Waller, Tree, Walter Bentley, George Yates,
Charles Warner, J. L. Warner, Wilson Bar-
rett, Benson, 11. B. Irving, Charles Pond,
Forbes-Robertson, Edmund Tearle and
Osmond Tearle. Of these Bandmann, Asche,
Bentley and Wilson Barrett impersonated
the Moor in Australia, and Lang, Waller,
Charles Warner (“Drink”) and Irving
have stormed here in other roles. Perhaps
the best Othello we have seen was George
Rignold. He did not attempt the part till
late in his career (Sydney Criterion, March
25. 1899), and his artistry was then at its
highest.
“G.A.C.”: Hearing Fred Bluett sing once
again of the body in the bag, at Brisbane
Bohemia, reminded me of a story of the old
days of bellowdrama. It happened in the
summertime at Charters Towers, when Miss
Fitzmaurice Gill and her company were play-
ing some blood-and-thunder thing. The plot
hinged upon the substitution of a Prime Min-
ister’s body (we moved in the highest circles
in those days) for a quantity of treasure in
a chest, which was secreted in the vaults of
a bank, ruined castle, Y.M.C.A. or some such
edifice. The Prime Minister was correctly
murdered and placed in the chest; then the
curtain fell, to denote the lapse of a week.
It rose on the same scene, where the villain
had had the bad taste to arrange an assigna-
tion with the heroine. She came dowmstairs,
holding her ermines over her priceless gown,
MAKING IT EASY FOR HIM.
“How did Dauber get on with your portrait,
dear?”
“Spoilt it! He painted the complexion like
mud—and after me telling the stupid
what colors I use, too!"
and remarked, in a terrified tone: “What
a creepy place! And what a musty odor!’"
There was a slightly stunned gentleman sit-
ting well forward, and he sought to clear up
the lady’s perturbation. “It’s the—liic —
chap in the chest, miss,” lie burbled good-
naturedly.
“Billo C.” on the stage soliloquy:—
“O.K.’s” contention that the stage soliloquy is
more convincing and natural than expository dia-
logue (B. 6/12/’23) looks like special pleading. In
any case, it depends on how the thing is done.
Dialogue is always rational, however clumsily
handled; whereas, barring ejaculatory words and
sentences, no one outside a mental home or a hatter’s
hut normally talks aloud to himself. It requires
the art of a Shakspeare to make you forget the
absurdity of it. As for explanatory dialogue, it
would be an acute problem to play half of Shaks-
peare and two-thirds of Ibsen without its aid.
“Hamlet” is the finest example of skilful handling
of opening exposition, and “The Second Mrs. Tank,”
despite a little obviousness, shows very clever treat-
ment of the same necessary job. By way of con-
trast, let the carping critic examine a specimen of
the typical Victorian play. The hero, or comic man,
holds the stage solus. He looks through a door,
closes it quietly and barges in with, “Ha! It
is Sir Outhbert searching for the marriage certificate.
How shall I foil him ? I have it! I will put this
unsatisfied judgment summons in its place.” If
there is anything “natural” or “convincing” about
that sort of self-talk, then something is rotten in
the state of Dramadom. Plays that endeavor to
develop action without the preliminary spadework
of enlightening the audience about essential past
happenings are often dull, generally difficult to follow
and always exasperating. Better five minutes with
the butler, housemaid and family friend at the start
than a cycle of obscure motives and mystification.
“Flyman”: Nellie Farren and Fred Leslie
had a bitter experience with “Little Jack
Sheppard” (B. 22/11/’23). When they
arrived in Australia they found that Fannie
Robina and Teddy Royce had used up a lot
of their best stuff, and that Australians
wouldn’t look at it again. Charles Godfrey
and other stars of the period, fallen and
otherwise, lodged the same complaint. In
Godfrey’s case, however, nobody had at-
tempted his “Charge of the Light Brigade”
scena—a row of property horses front and
a set representing “The Charge,” with God-
frey on a horse in centre-front, sabring the
unseen gunners while all the gods wondered.
The copyists had shied at the thing—it was
too big for them. But Godfrey was mea-
sured for it.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: A cruel joke was played
upon a member of a travelling co. who had
an outsize reputation as a gay dog wdien an
unauthorised “Rev.” was prefixed to the
labelled address on his luggage, which had
arrived at his Adelaide caravanserai before
him. The publican objected to accommo-
dating wowsers, and, when the actor arrived
in a slightly sober condition, he was told,
rather curtly, that there was no room for him.
“I suppose you have ruddy well heard some
ruddy rumors about me,” said the unreverend
gent. “Let me ruddy well tell you that I
know how to behave myself. I’ve never been
insulted in this ruddy way before in my ruddy
life.” Such language from a parson took
Bung’s breath away. “I may be ruddy well
fond of a bit of ruddy fun, but I’ve never
been guilty of bringing any ruddy woman
into the place I’m stopping" at.” The land-
lord gasped. “And if I do booze that’s my
ruddy business, as long as I’m able to keep
my ruddy legs and see’my ruddy self to my
room.” The landlord was nearly choking.
“And if I like a rjsddy game of poker, I play
quietly and lose/my ruddy money without
making any ruddy fuss, and it's no business oi
any dashed vermilion natural child”
When Bung regained his breath it was to
remark that the btlier seemed a dinkum sort,
even if he was a ruddy parson. Then the
reason for the hostile reception came out.
“Flyman”: “Spangles's” hypnotic beer-
bibber (B. 29/11/ 28) was not a mere faker.
When alive he could have been backed for
£5OO to go intb a sealed case and sleep
seven days without food and drink. This
known fact accounted for his show bluffs
never being called. He was a physical mar-
vel. You could stick packing-needles into
any non-vital part of his body, and he would
only grin. A fancy stunt when he got to
about the fifteenth beer was to bite a piece
out of a tumbler and chew it. Then he
would offer, for a consideration, to drink a
wineglassful of kerosene or castor-oil. A
native of the Sydney Rocks, he made a for-
tune for the “hypnotist” who travelled him
all over the world, but died on another sort
of rocks in Canada.
“Thersites”: So Jimmy Hay (B.
18/12/’23) lias been playing Patie in “The
Gentle Shepherd.” I hadn’t heard of the
Westralian tenor since he left the Gilbert
and Sullivan co. here. Hay never seemed
robust on that tour, and "was frequently
represented by that other clever Westralian,
Charles Mettam, who at different times sang
all the G. and S. tenor roles in Day’s
stead. I saw Mettam —he is now in Maori
land with “The Beggar's Opera”—step into
Hay’s pumps as Rackstraw in “Pinafore”
at very short notice. That is a very exact
ing part, but Mettam topped it off the samf:
evening by giving a good account of himself
as the defendant in “Trial by Jury.” Hay
was a Perth pupil of Charles Kenningham.
“Orb”: Edwin Brett (B. 13/12/’231 first
appeared here in “Miss Hook of Holland.”
Brett was musical in those days, and scored
many of his own singing numbers —“Round
and Round,” for instance. He commenced
his strutting at Sadler’s Wells in bellow-
drama, and was subsequently Paul Devine
in “Human Nature” at Drury-lane, a pari:
played here by the brilliant Phil Beck, who
committed suicide some time later. Brett
was also the Baron IJartfeldt in “Jim the
Penman” to Arthur Dacre’s Jim. Other en-
gagements were with August Van Biene, of
“The Broken Melody,” and he was also
Gentleman Joe in the Gaiety success of that
name. Brett has done a good deal of sketch
work on the Moss-Stoll circuit, his wife
assisting.
“Second Murderer”: Henry Kolker has
been getting a little divorce-court limelight
in the U.S.A. It reminds me that when he
was here 15 years ago as leading man with
Margaret Anglin one enthusiastic pressman
(God forgive him!) wrote: “When in a ten-
der mood every syllable carries a caress, and
the American accent purrs one into a state
of rest and contentment.” It didn’t matter
that Kolker was really German, born in Ber-
lin.
“Hamfat”: An actor-r from Maoriland
tells me that masterpieces from old Inger-
soll’s brush are still to be seen in some of the
“smalls.” I recall an Ingersoll drop-curtain
at Picton. Above a groggy Windsor Castle
a flag as big as the tower stood in the breeze
as if it had been cut from tin. On Father
Thames, Noah, his wife, and their three sons
and daugliters-in-law had stepped out of a
toy ark into something that might pass for
a skiff; eight oars were in the air and eight
ip. the water. In the foreground a cock-
eyed cow grazed among flowers as large as
cabbages. But bucolic Maoriland accepted
his works of art as the things proper to the
occasion ; and I daresay many a better man’s
product was condemned for no other reason
than that it was different.
“Norbell”: Touching the shifting of Syd-
ney’s Poverty Point from the corner of King
and Castlereagh streets to the intersection of
Park and Pitt (B. 15/11/’23), though the,
change of venue took place donkey’s years ago I
got a “bite” at the old corner the other day.
“Once more, well met at Cyprus, laddie!”
said a cheery voice, and one of the Old Bri-
gade claimed me for his own. I commentedi
on our meeting at the old Point again,
whereupon my friend admitted that he had:
spotted me from the Criterion corner, and
had followed me on the off-chance. He got.
it.
THE JESTERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We’ve laughed our way to the hearts of men
Since ever the world began;
It’s on with the motley and toes a-tune
To the piping notes of Pan!
A huckster cries in the market-place
Loud boasts of the wares he sells ;
We’ve nought but wit and a cap to fit —
Heigho for the Cap and Bells!
We know no weapon of grim offence;
But ever the world has known,
Though swords may sever the cords of fate,
A laugh can win a throne —
A throne set high in a child’s dear heart,
And ever a smile impels
A chuckling note in a warm, white throat.
Then hey for the Cap and Bells!
Though grief shall gather its tithe of tears,
Yet we, that the world may smile,
Will trundle a hoop to the gates of death,
With a laugh on our lips the while;
Will fling the bauble and crave the moon,
Dance on as the chorus swells.
From grave to gay is a world away ;
But ho for the Cap and Bells !

MAKE every trip pro-
ductive. Start out
right—with a Stevens shot-
gun. Its margin of safety
in construction, the simplic-
ity of its few parts, the per-
fect workmanship through-
out minimize danger of acci-
dents, possibility of broken
elements—and disappoint-
ment.
Model No. 115, pictured above,
combines a fine appearance and
general utility. It is manufactured
in 12, 16, 20, 28- and .410-Gauge.
Barrel is of compressed forged
“Electro” steel, bored for nitro
powder. Weight about 6 lbs. Fires
any standard factory loaded shell.

Maira: This paper is beginning to sus-
pect that somebody in Papua trains the youngster
to say “Massis, please,” after the local “head’ has
reproved him with “And what do you say when the
gentleman gives you tobacco?” Anyway, the artless
remark about matches has been made to almost every
member of the Bulletin staff C.L. J.: Come on.
But don’t struggle to be unnatural... .Tug: “The
freetrade success.” What freetrade success?....
Wyben: Afraid it’s too late to be of any interest
n0w....5.L.L.: Hobble yourself next time you start
to write. ...New Chum: Thank you; but there is
not enough meat in it. .. .C. 5.8.: Far too wordy. In
this paper you’ve got to plunge right into business
and leave as soon as it’s done. . . .W.M. (M.L.) : They
must be newer than that 0ne.... A.P.M.: There is
no real feeling there. .. .Accarak: A quadruple blue
would be a man picked to represent his University
in four different sports C.L.C.: Now, that’s very
tuneful. Don’t let it be an orphan.... Sambo:
Utterly futile. ... Phyllis 0.: Grow up and try again.
. ...F.M.E.: Not nearly.... Don F.: Short-weight
in interest.... D.T. (Mittagong) : Doesn’t succeed, but
it is full of promising turns. .. .J.P.0.: Sorry “The
Listener” can’t hear much good of itself.... Mar-
garet O.: On the samples, you show no signs of
being a poet 8.C.F.: Must be a lot better than
that to get its nose in.... George M.: No good at
all E.J.L.: Pleasant enough, but it doesn’t get
to anything. .. .Isolde R.: You don’t quite catch the
spirit. See if you can’t improve on it. .. .Final :
Frankly, it’s the worst kind of rubbish known to ihe
basket. .. .Marginata: Too slight for us. .. .Margot
M.: Not quite. .. .J.M.C.: Says only the obvious
things in poor verse R.A. (Pleas Point) : Thin
and commonplace E.R.R.: No use here.... Abel
Seaman: Must go back. The yarn wanted a different
handling to make it convincing Tasmanian Devil:
Hardly enough there 8.J.A.: “Wings” fails to
carry the weight S.S. (lnnisfail) : The verses miss,
but there is some merit in them. . . .P.8.V.: Only a
schoolboy sketch of matter best forgotten.... A.W/T.:
We didn’t laugh at it; we didn’t believe it; and we
didn’t admire the way it was written.... R.D.C.:
Pleasing, but not quite well enough done. . . . J.R.S.:
You don’t seem to know what verse is. .. .Ewol H: Poor
and thin Nomad: Heavy and feeble Clancy
J.: Same old yarn in rather worse verse than usual.
.. . . J.M.H.: “Demon, oh, Demon” —shoo! Go away !
....Noo Zee: Haven’t any idea U.M.C.: Far
too much like the northern elevation of a camel.
.. . .E.H.M.: Doesn’t hit us where we say “Come in.”
. ...J.R.P.: That long-drawn-out allegory can only
be tedious Augustus W.: Delicate little thing:—
It is not the flowers in the Spring,
Neither the songs the birds sing,
That did me happyness bring.
It is our wedding-bells that ring.
It is not that the skys are blue
Or _ the stars that shine are true;
It is the Love in my heart aglow.
That is why. I only love you.
It is not the cruel World I fear,
Neither the strife of my life I care;
It is the love of our home I bear.
It is only you that makes life so dear.
....F.M.E.: “An Old Song” has a lot of charm,
but it is too hard to fathom what it all means....
Tere: Your Butterflies don’t flutter brightly enough.
.. . .R.F.G.: The clerk of works refuses to pass it.
.... Wilton P.: The yarns are poor and the writing
worse G.R.A.: You don’t get in the touches that
might give it life Thalwa: Too wild and raw
Victor C.: You must put more into them than that,
or you won’t get your poet’s license renewed on
Jan. 2....Z.V.W.: That coal hulk when it gets to
work in verse always does just the same things....
J.A.A.: Description of the preliminaries of a surgical
operation must be done exceptionally well now to
carry it in. . . .E.C.H.: We don’t find it exciting. .. .
Lone Hand: Doesn’t take a trick R.A. (Towns-
ville) : Only half a yarn. . . .M.C.V.: The story might
live if it had a different handling. .. .M.J.A.:
Weary, staggering verse without 5ki11.... Sid S.:
“Easy Money” doesn’t convince us. .. . H.L.W.: Verse
that starts by stringing questions together to ask
the commonplaces of the daily newspaper leaders is
never any g00d.... Eliot R.: Suburban mirth of an
elephantine sort. .. .G.R.L.C.: You don’t make us
believe that it’s true T.E.J. J.: Not well enough
done. . . .Bellerive: Trip on your merry way:—
I carry a bluey slung o’er my back
To spin a sad tale of the wallaby track.
I seek shelter at night when chilly and dark.
In summer I doss ’neath a bench in the park.
I nod for my tucker and bite a toff’s ear
For a tray or a sprat for a drop of good beer
Some people don’t like me, but ’tis all in the game.
I m known “Blimey Lord,” and am proud of mv
name.
They can call me a loafer, a blighter or scamp
I don’t care a hang—l’m a suburban tramp.
. ...Q.1.L.: “The Patriarch” misread the par. “The
Deacon” said “Maoriland has already two bishops
from the Cardinal’s College [Manly] ; but Father
Hartigan if he lands the job fat Goulburn] will be
the first Australian”— i.e., the first Australian bishop
from the Manly College. The Dwyer brothers were
educated abroad C. 8.: Too much of it is a mere
repetition of cable news. Perhaps you could make
a selection of unreported incidents from later letters.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
R.C.W.: Big space; little merit C.J.C.: No
kick in that idea.... K.T.: Your drunk certainly has
fascinating feet. . . .Anon: Dress jokes hardly worth
it K. 8.: Jumbled splodge K.F.: Not up
M.J.H.: A glimmer of promise in it H.D.: No
general interest A.E.C.: Why would the padre
say that to the postman, anyhow ?... .A.S.: No
three times W.F.M.: Both gags smell of yester-
year. ... L.8.W.: Barefaced copy of recent Punch
drawing T.L.P.: If you mailed a humorous draw-
ing then the humor got lost in the post J.R.T.D.:
All among the also-fells.
“Topee”: I have a theory that Cockney
’busmen’s wit is hereditary. A returned Dig-
ger acquaintance of mine, whose father was
for years a noted “Bank and Fenchurch-
street” driver, is now a Sydney caretaker,
and executes small commissions for the
tenants. Last week he told me: “No. 39
gave me 7s. 6d. to get a pocket diary, with
shiny-top pencil, for his boy’s Christmas
present. I went to a stationer’s and the
bloke asks: ‘For this yeah?’ ‘No.’ I sex.
‘For 1746, so as to be quite up to date with
this joint of yours !’ ”


Just Like a Man.
(By “Phlox.”)
u "|~OHN, I want to speak to you.”
# I “Yes, dear.”
“Don’t dear me! You ought to be
ashamed of yourself! The idea of a middle-
aged man like you giving a dinner-party for
a young actress. But old fools are always
the worst.”
“Surely you wouldn’t call me old, dear?”
“You’re older than I am. But you’re get-
ting away from the point in question. What
have you to say for yourself?”
“Nothing.”
“Then I’ve got something to say to you.
I’m simply not going to stand ’for you giving
dinners to actresses while I sit at home and
gaze at four walls.”
“But, Blanche, you don’t like Bohemian
nights, and as a pressman I simply can’t get
out of attending them sometimes.”
“Yes, but there’s no need for you to carry
on with a woman young enough to be your
daughter. I heard all about you and Miss
Fortesque in the conservatory.”
“Ha, ha, ha! He, he he!”
“What are you laughing at, you idiot?”
“I’m laughing at you saying that Miss
Fortesque is young enough to be my daugh-
ter. You’ll be surprised to know that she's
two years older than you are, my'dear.”
“Nonsense ; she only looks a girl.”
“She may look one, but she isn’t. Fancy-
accusing me of carrying on with poor old
Bertha!”
“Well, all I can say is that the way she
makes up is shameless.”
“As far as I know she doesn’t make-up.”
“John, you’re a bigger idiot than I thought
you were.”
“Thank you very much, Mabel. But I
must be going. I’ve got an appointment.”
“Why, John, you promised to take me tu
the pictures to-night.”
“Then I’m very sorry, for I simply can’t.”
“I suppose you’re going to meet Miss For-
tesque.”
“How absurd you are, Mabel! Anyway,
Bertha always looks nice, and she’s rattling
good company. Ta, ta !”
About half-an-hour later the maid an-
nounced Miss Oliver,
“How are you, Mrs. Forbes?” she began.
“Just dropped in to see if you’d come on
the committee of the new Free Kinder-
garten. Just met Mr. Forbes in the hotel
lounge with Miss Fortesque, who was look-
ing lovely in a royal blue panne velvet
evening-gown, which showed up her glorious
complexion.”
And before Mrs. Forbes could get in a
word edgewise the voluble Miss Oliver was
gone. Later, however, Mrs. Warden, the
clergyman’s wife, called. Mrs. Forbes wel-
comed the pretty, tactful little woman as a
friend in whom she could confide. She told
her of her husband’s neglect, and of how he
was paying attention to Miss Fortesque.
“My dear Mrs. Forbes,” began Mrs. War-
den, “you are quite mistaken about your
husband’s attentions towards Miss For-
tesque. As a pressman he must meet and
make himself agreeable to star actresses. I
know Miss Fortesque to be a good church-
woman.” ■
“That’s what my husband says, but its
hard for me to be left alone evenings. Be-
sides, he accused me of being dowdy and
withered-looking. I notice, Mrs. Warden,
that you always manage to look bonnie.”
“Well, yes, dear; even a clergyman’s wife
needs to take pains to keep her looks. Good
looks help one in any walk of life. But if
you’ll pardon me, dear, you’ve not quite kept
yourself up to the mark. If, however, you'll
use the same face-cream as I do—Mercolized
Wax —you’ll soon have a new, fresh skin.”
“Oh, I’d use anything that would make my
skin decent. But look at my hair, it has
become brittle and faded, and is fast grey-
ing. You must be my age, and you haven’t
a grey hair.”
“No, because I keep off old age as far as
my hair is concerned by using Stallax as
a shampoo. To restore grey hair I make a
preparation of my own at home. I get two
ounces of Tammalite concentrate from the
chemist, and mix it with three ounces of
Bay Rum, and after a few applications the
grey hair .is restored to its natural color.
Miss Fortesque told me about these prepara-
tions in London years ago.”
“How comforting to know of them. I’ll
get the Mercolized Wax, the Stallax and the
Tammalite straight away. I’m delighted
you called, Mrs. Warden. When John
comes home I’ll tell him what a pleasant
evening we had.”
“And don’t worry when he tells you that
you are dowdy. That is just like a man.”
Next morning an excellent interview with
Miss Fortesque appeared in the paper.
“How good this interview is, John,” re-
marked Mrs. Forbes.
“So glad you like it, dear; I wrote it.”
“So that’s why you were with Miss For-
tesque ; but why ever didn’t you tell me ?”
“Because professional etiquette forbade
me.”
“As Mrs. Warden says, ‘just like a man ’ ”

“F. Clinton” : Tlie man who can discover
a commercial use for the husks of cocoa
beans will be offered a drink by the big
chocolate- and cocoa-manufacturing inter-
ests. The husks are a bran-like residual,
and at first sight seem a suitable stock-food;
but though stock take to it fairly readily,
awkward results are liable to follow. Sows
about to add to the population have been fed
with the husks and wholesale abortion re-
sulted ; and as it is not clear what brings
about this result, the manufacturers are for
the moment in a bog.
* * * *
“Pervicax”: “N 5 West” (B. 29/11/'23)
was unfortunate in his selection of insur-
ance cos. if he could not get his parcel cov-
ered for transmission by post inside the
Commonwealth. Recently, when in Queens-
land, I had occasion to' send to Sydney a
parcel of goods worth £3O or £4O, and had
no difficulty in insuring against loss, includ-
ing theft or pilfering. I paid 2s. 6d. on a
declared value of £3O; in other words, the
co. bet me £1 to Id. that my parcel would
be delivered intact.
“H.H.” : Macquarie Island, where the pen-
guin-oil industry is a thing of tin', past, may
again become a bustling metropolis of half a
dozen cabins. The British Government has
given a license to a Norwegian firm to go
whaling in the Ross Sea, and it wants the
island as a depot. Since the issue of the
license the Ross Sea has been handed over to
M.L., but the license stands. M.L. will,
however, gather royalties; and if Tasmania
gives the lease of Macquarie Island, Hobart
will benefit by being made the base of the
whalers. There are five vessels already on
the job.
* * * *
“8.R.A.” : The supplying of the Sydney
market with locally-grown tomatoes in the
early part of the season is left almost en-
tirely to Chinese gardeners. One Chow
garden in a suburb lias for months been
forwarding anything up to 300 cases p r
week and collecting £1 per case for them.
Of course, there is a good deal of work at-
tached ; they have to be protected from frost,
birds and insect pests, and require a lot of
looking after. But the money is there, and
that’s more than can be said for egg-cockying
and other branches of the game to which
the Digger has been side-tracked.
“Cumloden”: During the rush at the
poultry stall at the Victoria-street market
the other Saturday morning an elderly lady
approached the salesman and ordered a fowl,
adding “An’ don’t forget the giblets.” Throw-
ing a dressed cliook on to the paper the per-
spiring one dived into a small keg underneath
the counter, bromrht forth a handful of sun-
dry feet, gizzards, etc., and wrapping the
whole lot into a parcel snapped “Four-an’-
six, please.” Taking a firmer grip of her
purse, the housewife quietly undid the parcel
and enumerated the component parts; then
fixing the salesman with an icy stare, she
asked solemnly, “And had it no neck?”
“Tweedite”: A, discussion on the recent
motion before the Tweed District Council of
the P.P.U. for the establishment of a co-
operative tannery and boot factory provided
some interesting information. The local
hide-buyers are giving 2s. for calfskins,
and up to ss. for big hides, and com-
plain there’s nothing in it. Yet a local man
who bought a hide and had it tanned—the
cost, including freight, being under 30s. —on
taking it to a local saddler was informed
that the wholesale price charged for half a
hide of this weight was £8 15s. One district
hide-buyer who got in touch with a tanner at
Botany, with the object of selling his hides
direct, was informed that the only way the
tanner could buy his hides was through
something he called “the ring.” In our help-
lessness it all looks like another argument in
favor of the New State, with the indepen-
dent industries that would grow up within it.
* * * *
“Faro” : Australia’s coal industry will lose
a good customer when the Maoriland hydro-
electric proposals become an accomplished
fact. Last year the Dominion paid £440,868
for N. S. Wales coal as against £81,478 in
1887. Auckland is looking forward to the
day when it will be able to dispense with
coal-importation entirely; it will come all
the sooner if Perry, the M.L. engineer, can
induce Massey to take advantage of a U.K.
offer to finance the Arapuni scheme. The
job of harnessing the Waikato at this point
has already been started, but without foreign
capital the scheme w T ill take longer to mature
than did the Waipori in the far south. The
estimated cost exceeds half a million, and
the present state of the M.L. exchequer
will not keep the pay-roll going for long.
Northern towns like Hamilton. Cambridge
and possibly Rotorua will be served as well
as Auckland.
* * * *
“Sixenate”: The doors of another big
batch of Sydney pubs have been closed by
the Licenses Reduction Board during the
last few weeks; and some of the Bungs are
complaining bitterly that, although they sup-
ply the money for their own compensation,
it is not being fairly allotted. One of the
deliccnsed is the Glen, in Liverpool-strcet.
Only three months before it was ordered to
close the licensee was offered £5500 for his
scrap of paper, but refused it. All the com-
pensation the Board allotted him was £1920.
To get into the Golden Lion, in Devonshire-
street, the licensee paid £2400 three years
ago; he leaves with £l2OO. But it doesn’t
always work out like that. For the license
of a small pub in an out-of-the-way street
£l4OO compensation was awarded. The legi-
timate trade of the premises would not have
entitled the holder to half the money ; but this
Bung was one of the worst sly-groggers in
his district, and by pushing the after-hours
trade showed a turnover which impressed the
Board. That is the basis of a grievance
which looks thoroughly genuine; for obvi-
ously if too much is drawn out of the fund
to pay some, there remains too little to pay
others. Not that the fund is hard up; it
is indeed another grievance that the Board
is not paying out what it might, and has
lent a cool half-million to the impecunious
Government.

“F.R.”: In memoriam notice from Melb.
Argus (l/12/’23) :
In proud remembrance of my gallant old dad,
Capt. A. Bethune, R.N., and his eight sons and five
grandsons, who gave their lives for the Empire and
peace. —Inserted by his only daughter, Moonee Ponds.
A record of eight sons in • action must be
almost unique.
H. A. R. Ilnggins, who has just retired
from his job of M.L. Controller of Savings
Banks and Accounts, stuck to this one branch
of the service for over 40 years, and saw
the deposits grow from one million to 44.
It was he who engineered the M.L. ser-
vice’s scheme through Parliament.
“Bison”: In an election speech in England
last week Prime Minister Baldwin told an
aggravating interjector that he would “leave
all foodstuffs on the free list —including
thistles.” That is an improvement on George
Reid’s retort at a bygone Federal election:
old Yes-No said he would “favor a stiff duty
to encourage the production of feeding-
bottles.”
“8.R.A.”: Persons writing letters from
Germany to-day need to be millionaires. An
ordinary-sized letter arrived the other day
from Germany covered with stamps to the
value of 30,000,000 marks. A few months
ago a similar letter could have been sent
for 600 marks ; a few years ago, for one-tenth
of a mark. At the pre-war rate of exchange
30 million marks would be worth a million
and a half sterling. At the present rate they
are worth some absurd fraction of a penny.
“Percy Spanner”: Sydney Sun recently
published a photograph of the site of the
I', and O. wharf in 1883, showing 25 loco-
motives being landed for the railways. It
added sarcastically that the speed of some
trains indicated that these engines were still
in use. As a matter of fact they are.
Drayed to Redfern, to what is now part of
the railway yards, they were put together by
Dubbs and Co. They are not up to big
weights, but they still do useful work. They
are catalogued from D 260 to D 284.
“W. Seetee” : “Help yourself” has been the
advice of many politicians to W.A. of late
years. She has tried to, and her land-
scape is dotted with derelict attempts in
the form of jam, glass, pottery and other
factory wrecks. But she tries again. This
time it is perfume. Her shops are luscious
with the odor of her boronia, home-grown,
home-squeezed and fresh from the pipkin,
looking like liquid gold. ’Tothersiders will
get some among their Christmas gifts. Lon-
don and Paris whiffs don’t approach it for
clarity and lingeringness; still, they may
kill it if the tariff does not hold a mantle
of protection over it.
“P. Le L.” : The law hands out a license
to any individual over a certain age who
has reached competency at the wheel of a
motor-car. A tram motor-man or a railway
loco.-driver are both subjected to a severe
test as regards physical fitness and effi-
cicncy. Why not the driver of a motor-car V
I know one licensed driver who is under con-
stant medical treatment for chronic heart
trouble. When his Buick takes a header for
the nearest passing car, or crashes into a
shop window with the owner-driver in a
state of syncope, the Coroner may make some
regretful allusion to ineligibles being fur-
nished with licenses. But I doubt if he will.
“Noo Zee” : The Aussies in France seldom
refused any drink with a kick in it; and
I’ve often wondered how many struck the
forbidden absinthe. I asked for it in many
places, but only once sampled it. While
running a wet canteen on the Amiens-Albert
road, just before the big Villers-Bret. stunt,
I had to go. twice a week for beer to Poix,
on the other side of Amiens. The brewer was
an amiable soul and generally turned on
something better than the beverage he sup-
plied us with whenever his account was paid
—we were spending over 2000 francs per
week on stuff which the boys called “legs
and arms” because it had no body. When
I was taking final leave of him he produced
a bottle of absinthe, after binding me to
the strictest secrecy. His obvious enjoy-
ment in mixing the opalescent “spot” gave
me more pleasure than the drinking of it.
“F.A.”: As a zealous commercial traveller
the Gyppo “eggs-a-cook” merchant takes
beating. Our mounted units would often
start for field work eight or ten miles out in
the desert at 7 ack emma, at which hour
not a salesman was to be sighted. When
the units were settling down to the first
smoke-o, a swarm of hen-fruit purveyors
would swoop down on the outfit, apparently
from nowhere, but in reality from a dis-
tance of anything up to a dozen miles.
Generally the vendors were not allowed near
the Diggers until the mid-day meal-hour, but
they often got near enough for piastres to be
jerked to them in exchange for a couple of
eggs deftly projected along the sand to the
purchaser. When the exchanges became too
persistent the sarn-major would give the
“imshi,” and the bunch would withdraw to a
vantage point from which they could antici-
pate the next lialting-place. As many as
40 or 50 Gyppos would dog a unit about the
desert all day, and at most get rid of a
dozen eggs apiece for a gross return of about
sevenpence-ha’penny.
“G.R.”: William Knox D’Arcy, Mount
Morgan’s one-time Copper King, did not live
to see his dreams of Persian oil come true.
He sank many thousands of pounds in the
country east of Bagdad before he was enabled
to take steamer for Home with glad news
and some useful concessions from the
Teheran court in his pocket; but London
financiers were sceptical and he had diffi-
culty in raising the necessary capital. The
disappointment, coming on top of his three
years of worry and anxiety in arid Southern
Persia, helped to hasten his end. Sufficient
capital was gathered to make a start, but
just before the war the co. was in a bad way.
The British Government’s help was sought,
and Winston Churchill persuaded the Cabi-
net to put five million into ordinary shares
at par. It was a fine stroke of business.
Not only was the Empire’s supply of fuel
assured during a critical time, but the shares
quintupled in value, and now all the big oil
corporations are tumbling over each other to
get a footing in the as yet unexploited Mosul
country. Latest advices are that the
Standard Co. has persuaded the Shah to
give it a big slice east of Mosul, although
the Anglo-Persian people offered strenuous
opposition. Strenuous opposition doesn’t
carry much weight in Teheran unless it is
accompanied by hard cash.

associated with this quality is an
Economy and a Piquancy of flavor

The Jolly Sailor.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHERE blackened hulks lie heaving
Along the slimy bay,
An’ fishers take the dockside,
All crusted white with spray,
’Tis here the Jolly Sailor
Looks out upon the sea,
With seven bull's-eye windows
A-squinting down the quay.
An’ through the brine,
In rain or fine,
Ah, that’s where I would be!
Oh, call them back together,
The mates that used to come—
Old Looney Luke an’ Clancy,
An’ Murphy full of rum!
(Stamp your feet! Stamp your feet!)
Ole Murphy’s dead in Rio,
An’ Luke will never come!
’Twas fine to feel the breezes
That rattled round the Horn
An’ up the seas of China
Go beating through the morn;
An’ down from Porto Rico,
An’ South an’ South for me
To where the Jolly Sailor
Looks out upon the sea—
To wander late
With rolling gait
An’ chanteys loud and free.
Ho ho ! What ho, the Indies !
The palms along the shore!
The shrouds an’ steady foresail,
Along by Singapore!
(Beef it out! Beef it out!)
The ship is down with Davy
An’ never makes the shore!
“The lights are burning bright, sir!”
We’d hear the helmsman call,
All heaving at the mainsail,
Above the squealing squall.
And how the bows went bounding
Beneath the frothy foam
Through starry coral waters,
As pale as honeycomb!
We saw ahead,
With windows red,
The Jolly Sailor —home!
An’ there was song an’ laughter—
Mugs foaming to the brim —
An’ Saucy Kate to catch us
With ankles cute and trim.
(Drink it down! Drink it down!)
It’s beer from shining bottles,
All foaming to the brim!
An’ now ’tis sad an’ silent.
The windy keyholes seem
To fill the bar with whispers.
I sit alone and dream.
Against the cranky windows,
Like beads, the sand is blown;
An’ in the .Tolly Sailor
I tinple on my own.
No glass to clink
With silver tint —
Ole Murphy’s an’ my own.
Oh. fill your empty glasses
An’ beat the sandy floor!
A lusty ocean-chorus,
Oh. maties, come ashore!
(Beef it out! Beef it out!)
The boots of all the dead men
Are stamping on the floor!

[FOR THE BULLETIN.!
DATING his letter, “Camp, Sydney
Cove, New S. Wales, Ist October,
1788,” Major Ross, commanding the
Marines who ! formed the first garrison of
Australia, wrote a long complaint to Philip
Stephens, Secretary to the Admiralty
after whom Port Stephens is named—which
had to do with what he considered the un-
satisfactory conduct of certain of his officers.
Amongst the enclosures forwarded is the
following, which must be quoted in its en-
tirety in order to explain properly something
of the story which ensues. In this fashion
is it tersely set out: —
Proceedings of a Battalion Court-martial, held by
order of Major Robert Ross, Port Jackson, September
11th, 1788.
Capt. Shea, President.
Members: First-Lt. Shairp, First-Lt. Timins, First-
Lt. Davey, Second-Lt. Clarke.
William Strong, private, 24th Company, and
Richard Knight, private, 35th Company, brought
to tryal by order of the commanding-officer for
disobedience of orders, in preventing the person
authorized from bringing in materials to errect the
barracks for Capt’n Shea’s coy.
Mr. Brewer prosecutes, and informs the Court
that the rafters that were sawed by the prisoners
being wanted, he had applied to the commanding-
officer to have them brought in, when he gave orders
for that purpose, desiring him to go himself and
see it done. He (Mr.. Brewer) took four people
With him, and went to the sawpits, and repeated
to the prisoners Major Ross’s orders to take them
away, ordering the people to take up the rafters,
upon which William Strong, p’te, expressed very
civilly his apprehensions of Capt’n Tench’s displea-
sure should he permit them to go without his
orders, and requested that a written order might
be procured of Capt’n Tench to let them go. As
there were other rafters at the next pit, he wished
they would take them until,such order was obtained;
that he took the other rafters, and did not strenu-
ously persist in taking those he was ordered to
do; that on his return to camp he acquainted the
commanding- officer.
Question from the Court to Mr. Brewer: “Did the
prisoners at any time prevent your taking away
the rafters?” —“No, they <Jid not, but only requested
me not to take them, for ’the reasons before given.”
The prisoners being put on their defence, call
upon Captain Tench to inform the Ccpirt what orders
he had given them, and deny preventing Mr. Brewer
bringing in the rafters! Captain Tench informs
the Court that the sawpit the prisoners worked at
was dug by the company, and all the timber sawed
by it brought in by them, and since the publick
orders for the sawpit being under the direction of
Mr. Brewer, he never, sent any orders to the\sawyers
to obey Mr. Brewer or not —that the piece that
was then sawing was put on the pit by his (Oapt.
Tench’s) orders some time since, and, when sawed
un, suppos’d it would be converted to the use of
the battalion. That the prisoners are men of very
good character, and have always done their work
to his satisfaction.
Question from the Court to the prisoners: “Did
you ever receive any orders to obey Mr. Brewer t
—“No.”
The Court are of opinion that the prisoners are
not guilty, not having received any directions to
obey Mr. Brewer’s orders, and do therefore acquit
them. ...
Jno. Shea, Captain and President.
But this very sensible finding did not com-
mend itself to Major Ross, who directed that
the Court should meet again and revise its
proceedings. Which the Court accordingly
did, and called Captain Tench and Sergeant
Smith of his company. But —
The Court not being clear of the legality of calling
in fresh evidence, made application to the Judge-
Advocate for his opinion thereon, in answ’r to whicn
he informs them that the adducing of fresh testi-
mony, either for or against the prisoners, would be
a new tryal. ~ . ~
The Court, therefore, takes no notice of the
questions ask’d Serjeant Smith, and that having,
with the most mature and strict deliberations, re-
considered the whole of the proceedings, find no
pause to alter their original opinion.
This result made Major Ross, who was
evidently “laying” for Captain Tench, ex-
ceedingly annoyed, and he proffered a request
to their Lordships, through the Secretary,
that they might be pleased to order that offi-
cer’s recall. We have nothing to do vvith
that here, and, having considered the official
version of the incident, will turn to the un-
official manner in which it affected Bill
Strong and Dick Knight, privates, who had
been turned into “top” and “bottom” saw-
yers in the valley of the Tank Stream^
On the day following their final acquittal
by the Court-Martial, Privates Strong and
Knight were again working in their sawpit
up the valley of the little creek that ran
into Sydney Cove and provided the water-
supply of the settlement.
It was a glorious Spring day, and the
dense forest in which they worked was frag-
rant with the scent of wattles and boronia.
Down below them —they were somewhere
about where Park-street intersects Sydney s
two main thoroughfares to-day—the tents
of the settlement gleamed between the trees,
with the blue waters of the harbor shining
and glittering beyond them.
“Dick!” called Private Strong to his mate
as he drew the piece of timber they had just
sawn off and clattered it down on the
pile that represented their morning’s work—-
“th’ sun’s well over tli’ yard-arm,, an’ ’tis
tinm to take a bite an’ a sup. Do ’ee come
up topside, an’ we’ll take our dinner. 1
heard the bugler blow ‘Come to th’ cook-
house door’ this ten minutes gone. Blime,
lad, but I like this sort of work better’n
guard-mountin’ an’ drill, don’t you ?”
Private Knight clambered up out of the
pit, and stood on its edge, bareheaded and
sweating, brushing the sawdust out of his
red hair. A broad grin divided his freckled
face as he nodded acquiescence in his com-
rade’s sentiments.
“Aye,” he said slowly, in the accent ot
the West Country, “ ’tes a fine life, Bill —
’tes a man’s occypation this. Better’n all
th’ dom parade-ground foolin’ about we’m
so used to. Better a lot. I’d not moind so
be it they left us at it arl th’ toime.”
They sat down, and began to eat tlieir
scanty lunch of pickled pork and sea-biscuit.
Bill Strong passed a pint bottle of rum and
water to his mate, who, when he had drunk,
passed it back again to Bill. As the latter
removed it from his lips, he grunted with
satisfaction.
“An’ to think,” he said, “we might ha
been in th’ hospital this blessed minit, a-
nursin’ sore backs, an’ cursin’ Bobby Ross.
He done his best to get us there, blarst
him!” .
“Aye, that he did—an’ for to upset Cap n
Tench, too. ’Tes a miser’ble, cranky devil’s
tli’ Major. He’d ha’ had us two at th’ hal-
berds, an’ th’ Cap'n broke, an’ Muster
Brewer out’n his job, zo be un lia’ had his
way. He'in no kind of a man at arl. An’ he
sees no good in this country. 1 heerd un tell
to Cap’n Campbell ’twas not fit for dogs to
live in. Glory be! Look at tli day did
ever ye zee th’ loike to wlioam in England?
’Tes a foine country, Bill —and I know- one’s
a-goin’ for to arsk leave for to stop here
when tli’ detachment does go whoam.”
“Glad to hear you say so, Knight,” ex-
claimed a laughing voice behind them.
Both men scrambled hastily to their feet,
and faced about. At the further end of the
sawpit a good-looking officer in a captain’s
uniform stood leaning upon his walking-stick
and smiling at them.
“ ’Tis Cap’n Tench,” muttered Bill Strong,
as he saluted. His mate did likewise, star-
ing goggle-eyed at the newcomer, a little
apprehensive of his recent freedom of speech.
“I do ax y’r honor’s pardon,” he said —-
“we’m niver heerd y’r honor coom oop.’
“That’s all right, Knight,” said Captain
Tench. “I came quietly, so that none should
see me talking with you two men. I want
to warn ye. To set ye upon your guard.
I would not speak so freely as you have
just done. Even these woods have ears —and
there are many long tongues about. Now,
promise me ye’ll say nothing to anyone of
what I’m about to tell ye—for my sake as
well as your own.”
The two marines gaped at the officer. It
was not often they were invited to share the
confidences of such as he. Presently Strong
found his tongue.
“Y’r honor.” he said, saluting again,
“we’re y’r honor’s men, after what ye done
for us yestiddy —ain’t we, Dick?”
“Aye, that we be, y’r honor. Y’r honor
mav speak vreely wi’ us.”
“Good. Then I wish to say to you both
’twould be well to set a watch upon your con-
duct. The Commanding-Officer hath said to
Mr. Long, the Adjutant, who repeated it to
me. that lie’s going to have his eye upon you
both. You know what that means. Already
he hath given an order that you are to be
taken off this work and returned to duty. So
look out for yourselves. That is all. I
came to tell you this because I’m grateful to
you both for the way you conducted your
defence without getting me into more trouble
than was needful. I know you both for
smart soldiers and good characters —but ye’ll
need to watch yourselves. Now. good day to
you both. I’d get to work again if I were

Make Z&m-Buk a Daily Need
ACCIDENTS are always happening in the kitchen, in
the workshop, in the garden, and at the children’s
play, but a box of Zam-Buk brings the benefits
or speedy, antiseptic healing into your own home.
Directly Zam-Buk is applied to a wound
or sore it alleviates the pain or inflamma-
tion, reduces any swelling and prevents
the place taking bad ways.’’ Not
only is Zam-Buk a highly concen-
trated and reliable healing
agent—it also has splendid
antiseptic properties.
In a natural way
Zam-Buk stops
the growth of
harmful
microbes
that ac-
count for the
festering of a
neglected or
wrongly- treated
sore; it kills or nullifies
all dangerous influence at
once, and causes the tissues,
which it has first made clean in a
medical sense, to knit together once
more, until all trace of the sore or injury
has r 'one.
Zam-Buk carries on its antiseptic healing without hindrance
because the work is not impeded by the presence of any of the
coarse animal fats that are to be found in many other salves.
Zam-Buk is the ideal healer. 1/6 and 3/6 per box everywhere
LOSS OF HAND SAVED.
Writing from 46 East Street, Valley, Brisbane, Airs.
E. Kuskopf Says:—“Whilst working in Svdnev my
husband got one of his hands fast in some machinery,
and the top of a finger was torn right off. After hospital
treatment, the wound apparently healed, but only to break out
again soon after. Blood-poison soon developed, and the whole
hand was terribly discolored and inflamed, whilst the finger kept on
discharging matter. We dreaded amputation, yet it seemed unavoidable
until we began to use Zam-Buk.
“The Zam-Buk treatment proved wonderfully effective, and gradually
all poisonous matter and discoloration was drawn away, and the inflammation
completely subdued. As my husband had been off work seven weeks, you can
imagine our gratitude to Zam-Buk for its wonderful healing. Ultimately it effected
a perfect cure.”
Zam-Buk Medicinal Soap
should be used in all cases where any skin
trouble exists, in preference to ordinary soaps.
Used in conjunction with Zam-Buk Balm, Zam-
Buk Medicinal Soap will he found most sooth-
ing, and is an invaluable “aid” to the Zam-Buk
treatment. 1/- per tablet of all Chemists, or

you. You will be watched for the slightest
fault. Carry on, men.”
With a smile and a nod, Watkin Tench
turned towards the camp and walked down
the valley through the trees, acknowledging
the marines’ salute with a wave of his stick.
“He’m a dom good man, Bill,” observed
Private Knight, as they looked after his
disappearing red jacket.
“That he be. Wat Tench’s a gentleman.
He’s one o’ th’ quality. He’s chanced trouble
hisself a-comin’ up here for to speak to us
like that. So we’re to go back to tli’
parades an’ th’ guards, eh ! To H—l with
it, says I.”
“Aye, to H —l an damnation wi’ tli’
Major!” growled his mate. “I thought this
job’d be too good for to last.”
“Watch y’self, Dick —watch y’r tongue.
Come on —we’d best be found a-workin’ when
they comes to relieve us.”
All through the warm afternoon the grating
and whirring of their pit-saw made a sort of
music in the forest. Slowly the sun de-
clined towards the ridge on the western side
of the valley, but it was not until it had
sunk behind the hillcrest that anyone came
to deliver the orders Captain Tench had bid-
den them to be prepared for. Just as the
dusk began to steal imperceptibly into the
valley, they were hailed by a rough voice
from the edge of the pit.
“Now then, me coveys, ’tis time ye was
a-knockin’ off. Mr. Brewer’s sent me up
here to tell ye ye’re out of a job—at this game,
anyway. Ye’ll find plenty o’ guards an’
fatigues down below at th’ Camp, but ye’re
to be relieved here. ’Tis tli’ Major’s orders.
Take y’r saw wi’ ye, an’ get back to camp.
I’m to stay an’ count up the work ye’ve done
to-day. Off wi’ ye, now! Return the saw
to th’ Quartermaster-Sergeant—an' look
alive, d’ye hear me?”
The messenger was the Provost-Sergeant,
one Peter Doolittle, who was possibly, with
the exception of the Commanding-Officer, the
most unpopular man in the battalion. Mr.
Brewer had formerly been a midshipman in
11.M.5. Sirius. He combined the two offices
of architect and superintendent of the saw-
yers and carpenters with that of acting-
provost-marslial, and this man was his aide-
de-camp in both positions. Military police-
men have never been highly esteemed by any
body of soldiers, but Sergeant Doolittle, as
much by the brutality of his manner as for
any other reason, was peculiarly detested
in the garrison. Dick Knight, always hot-
headed as became his red hair, was about to
make some sarcastic remark when his com-
panion nudged him.
“Not a Word, Dicky—not a word. He’s
but tryin’ to provoke us. Don’t give him or
tli’ Major half a charnce.”
In silence they gathered up their belong-
ings, and departed down the valley, carrying
the long saw between them. It was almost
dark as they left the sawpit.
“I knew,” said Major Ross to the Gover-
nor, “I knew very well, your Excellency,
that these two men were bad characters.
Their conduct over the matter of those raf-
ters, when I had them court-martialled for
disobedience of orders, convinced me of as
much as that, even though they were very
improperly acquitted. I am strongly against
your giving favorable consideration to this
petition, which ought never to have been
presented to you.”
“Well, but my dear Major,” said Phillip
seriously, as he paced slowly up and down
the room at Government House in which he
had received the commanding-officer of the
Marines, “I cannot help observing that no
one in the garrison, saving yourself, has
aught but good to say of these two unfor-
tunate men. And the Criminal Court itself
has recommended them to mercy on account
of their consistent good conduct luring their
service with the colors.”
He picked up a paper from his writing-
table and studied it earnestly.
“Yes,” he said, resuming his wmlk, “it is
signed by every company officer in the bat-
talion and by almost every member of the
rank and file. Strong, it says here, giving
particulars, has twice saved life at sea, and
Knight has behaved with great gallantry in
action. It goes against the grain with me
to send two such men to a shameful death
upon what is, after all, purely circumstan-
tial evidence. Honestly, I think that this
is a case in which justice might be tempered
with mercy. Can you not see it yourself in
that light?”
Major Ross frowned and shook his head.
“No, your Excellency, I cannot see the
case in such a light. By my orders these
two men were taken away from their work
at this sawpit, and warned to return to regi-
mental duty. Mr. Brewer sends the Provost-
Sergeant, Doolittle, to inform them of this.
He is seen going to the sawpit just before
dusk. He does not return to camp, and the
next morning is found dead in the pit with
a broken neck. What is to be supposed?
Why, that one or both of these men, angered,
at losing a job they like and at being re-
turned to ordinary duty, vent their spleen
upon the unfortunate sergeant, and either
knock or throw him into the pit, where he
breaks his neck as a result of his fall. It
seems to me quite clear. For the sake of
discipline, your Excellency, I think that these
men should be made an example of. I have
arranged with the Provost-Marshal that
their execution shall take place at the scene
of the murder. I trust that your Excellency
will sign the warrant for it. No good can
come of leniency in such a case. I regret
to say that the detachment is almost out of
hand, owung to the example of its officers, I
think, who consistently fail to support me
in maintaining proper order and discipline.
I look to your Excellency for backing in my
endeavors to keep up discipline. I must
implore you to be firm in this matter.”
The Governor sighed as he sat down at
the table and took up a pen.
“Very well, Major Ross. I cannot, of
course, disregard your opinion. I will sign
the death warrant, but I still have my mis-
givings about it, and could wish that you
did not insist. Will you be good enough to
hand it to Mr. Brewer to-night?”
“Certainly, your Excellency,” said the
Major. “If I may say so, I think you have
acted very wisely.”
__ A little after sunrise, Privates Strong and
Knight stood beside the sawpit up in the
valley, awaiting the arrival of the Provost-
Marshal with the warrant for their execu-
tion. For some reason that gentleman was
late, and it was already past the hour
appointed for tlieir death by a good 10 min-
utes.
A company of Marines was drawn up
amongst the timber, and in front of it
stood a little group of officers, whispering
between themselves, and sorrowfully regard-
ing the two manly figures of the condemned
men. As a favor, it had been granted to
them that they should die by the bullets of
a firing-party, instead of by the hangman s
rope, and the six Marines told off to carry
out this distasteful business were drawn up
in front of them.
“Look at the brute,” said Captain Tench
in a low voice to Captain Meredith. “By
saying a word in tlieir favor he might have
saved these two poor fellows. What does
lie care about Doolittle’s death? All he
thinks of is getting even with the Court
that acquitted Strong and Knight over the
matter of those rafters. The man is nothing
but a pig—pig-headed and pig-souled. I
declare”
“Hush, my dear Watkin,” whispered Cap-
tain Meredith. “Hush—he is coming over
here.”
Major Ross walked over from where he
had been standing alone, regarding the two
prisoners as the Rev. Richard Johnson wli’is-
pered words of consolation to them, and came
up to the little group, which saluted him
grimly.
“Can any of you gentlemen account for
the Provost-Marshal’s absence?” he asked.
“It is w r ell past the time appointed for the
execution. This delay is most unfair to the
two prisoners—and to all of us,” he added,
as if ashamed of evincing any sympathy
with the condemned men. “Pray, has any-
one seen Mr. Brewer this morning?”
The Adjutant, Lieutenant Long, stepped
forward and saluted.
“He was sent for by his Excellency just
as the parade was moving off, sir.”
“Ah, here he comes now, sir,” exclaimed
Captain Meredith, pointing down the valley.
“There he is sir—running.”
“Call the parade to attention, Mr. Adju-
tal i !r’ v yowled the Major.
Dick, whispered Private Strong, “time’s
ajl n-ip’ a ■ it
. Good-bye, Bill, murmured Knight “One
thing—ire know we never done it. Tes so,
Muster Johnson—wi our dym breaths we
swears our innocence. Thankee kindly »,
for all yeve done. Good-bye—an’ Gawd
e ? •
Hurriedly and breathlessly the Provost-
Marshal approached the Major. For a few
moments, being winded, he was powerless to
, .
Read the warrant, Mr. Brewer, said
Major Ross impatiently. “This delay is
“ usable - ,
„ gasped the Provost-Marshal, puf-
flng, ’l —l have—m my hand—his Excel-
lency’s reprieve for these. two men. He says
—he says that he is going to order a new
trial. Shall I inform the prisoners sir?”
Major Ross glared at him, and then, as a
little murmur of approbation and relief broke
from the group of officers, turned round and
glared at them. Then his glare shifted to the
prisoners.
“By God,” lie growled, “the service is go-
ing to the Devil!”

The Scent.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THERE is a murmur of bees
Over the peaks of the trees;
The light winds flutter and run
Through the fingers of yellow sun
Caressing the world into Spring;
And a voice begins to sing
In the house were the pigeons flash.
Pates clatter and doors, with a clash,
Set the jointed timber ringing
W ithout a break in the singing;
Children's voices shrill
Come over the knees of the hill;
And the birds unresting
Go flirting, chirrup and feather,
In the fine blue weather,
Gathering moss for nesting.
Axe-strokes are ringing
And trees are falling,
Their green arms flinging
Abroad and sprawling
Wide on the carpet of scented fern.
The chips are white and the stumps are
blind.
If a man could learn
Of the tree’s mind
Whether they fall in laughter or pain
He might talk more wisely of loss and gain.
The word of a man
And the strong axe stroke!
And the sap that ran
When the green Spring woke
For fifty years of eager time
Goes up in a ripple of blue-grey smoke,
As a man’s dreaming
And doing and seeming
Flames into rhyme!
Only I know Hint where once was wood
There is pearl-blue ash and the scent is good.
If w T e had the word
Of the old green moss
Whether it deems it gain or loss
To make nests for the bird,
If the trees could tell
Whether sap that ran
To make bud and bloom
Sang “All is well’’
When the great trunk fell
For the nesting of man,
Could we laugh at doom?
The cross that was stark
When the winter was here
In the prime of the year
Is a question mark.
Should it curve to a circle when summer is
come,
Never a pulse of the air would be dumb;
For the hoop of immortal love would spin
Up and up where the stars begin,
Till the cosmic ages the dark dreams slay
with
Were things too young for a soul to play
with.
Only I know that where once was wood
There is pearl-blue ash and the scent is good.
