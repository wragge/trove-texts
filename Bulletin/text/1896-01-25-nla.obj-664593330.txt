COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. VV. Q. HEARNE.—Dear Sir, —Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. 1 write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine 1 was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, If. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney."
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
success.
“ 1 bought a large-size bottle of Hearne's Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured.—J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tam worth, N.S.W.”
“ We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”—Signed
by Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong, and
69 other leading residents.

Dr. Gibbons
Having completed his New and Centrally-situated
Electrical & Consulting Rooms
Will be Pleased to Welcome liis Friends
and Patients at
137 Elizabeth-street, SYDNEY.
Dr. aiBBONS,
Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS & SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those Who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing symptoms, namely :—Frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fullness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, &e.,
&c., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually, to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.
On Receipt op 6d. in Stamps He Will Send,

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A SOUTHERN SHORE.
Here the hollows are wave-enchanted,
Here are the winds that, scourge. 1 thru’ z .lies
Hlow with trumpets an anthem haunted,
Hreams of coral and dead men’s bones.
Over the bars, the foam, the thunder,
-rurple delights and sluiced lagoons,
Over the reefs that shatter asunder
-h lery waves in million moons ;
Over the ships that move untiring,
Lovely as floating madrepores,
a soul desiring
ultimate slumber on the shores,
Here away from the world’s endeavor
I, the gull, and the cloud are three,
i wo the same for ever and ever,
Inaccessible unto me.
They, from dawning of time, have floated
Careless over the earth and sea,
Ne er like mortals by darkness moated,
■Dungeoned spirits that would be free.
Bird, like music, and love, and morning,
Day’s forerunner, eternal joy,
T, ‘o" and all wings that beat are scorning
Man too heavy with sad alloy.
.Though the cycles of ages gather,
i 1 hou i’ the waves’ aerial snow
Fee lest rapture in every feather,
Ceaseless ecstacy thou dost go !
Thee no sorrow each age is bringing,
Joy for ever from bowy lips
Throws thee kisses, and ocean’s surging
Ihrills thy pennon’s tremulous lips.
Happy thou that Art ever flying,
Bold with a keen desire of life,
And, when death is upon thee, dying
Not with a soul’s despairing strife.
Thou art the same as birds that -fold. -d
Wings on the waves of a winsome world
Th ine delirious motion moulded
Under the winds at dawning hurled.
And for ever thy path is Fancy’s,
Seas, the sun, and the clouds thy peers,
And, like echoes of old romances,
Thou recallest our careless years.
Wellington, M.L.
HUBERT CHURCH.
A NOCTURNE.
The lamp of night is poised above the ocean ;
The long, bright billows swamp the sinuous
caves
Which mock their music; then with wild com-
motion
Rush out again to meet the braver waves,
To plunge with them once more through echoing
gloom,
Dread as the hollow darkness of the tomb.
Wet sands and dripping rocks in moonlight
glimmer ;
Crisp sea-froth flutters in the hurrying breeze ;
Far out from shore peaked sails like satin shimmer,
And one drops down to those enchanted seas
Below the ocean line—strange seas which lave
Mysterious shores with amber wave on wave.
All night the ocean pulses rising, falling
Will whiten the curved beach and fill with
sound
Moon-mellowed space and all the caverns calling
Like giants chained in darkness underground.
The moon will set ere dawn ; then twilight gray
Will break the golden night-dream of the bay.
N.S.W.
RICHARD DOWNEY.
POSING.
There’s a rage among the cultured to know how
the people feel,
If poverty has maddened,
If toil perpetual sours ;
The famine dire of Demos gives the journalist a
meal ;
The artist’s home is gladdened
By the sordidness of ours,
When we swarm beyond our hovels in a fierce and
ghastly tribe,
We are “posing ” for the painter and the poet and
the scribe.
And the parson learns the patter; it was heard, a
quaint conceit,
The world was made past healing,
Lost in wickedness and blind,
That the glory of the Christ might shine in con-
trast more complete.
This touched the artist-feeling,
This pleased the poet mind,
Foils forever ’gainst a brightness that can never be
our own,
Are we “copy ” for the godhead ? Must we
“{K>se ” before the Throne?
M.L.
C. CLYDE.
A LIFE.
Long time he drifted ’mid the surging flow
Of intermingling men ; they bustled by,
Sparing no thought to him who lingered nigh,
And knew him not—nor did they wish to know.
So the wan, creeping days stole to and fro
Like grey ghosts summoned earthward by a
sigh, \
And, whilst he craved men’s love and sympathy,
He lived his life apart, in silent woe.
He grew into a wrinkled man who zoned
Himself with fancied griefs, and loathed his
strange
Empeopled solitude ; who oft bemoaned
Men’s apathy, and welcomed an exchange
Of Life for Death, wherein no ghosts were rife
Like those which haunted all his Death in Life.
Sydney, ’95.
THOROLD DALRYMPLE.
TAREEL DOOL.
In our great Desert’s heart of hearts there lies
A place of graves, grown round with grey-brown
reeds
That shiver without stirring, like stout weeds
Touched by sad zephyrs at the morning rise.
A sullen sea of salt moans out his sighs
Into the heavy air—sounding his needs
To the red blood-filled sun—who drips and bleeds
Flame-bearing tear-drops from his sightless eyes.
Once, in a kindly winter’s deepest cool,
I journeyed thither. Trembling by the edge
Of that grim shore, I watched the monsters feast,
And gazed on skeletons of man and beast
Gathered by hundreds in the briny sedge
That guards the confines of the Tareel Dool.

SATURDAY, JANUARY 25, 1896.
The Federal Capital.
Nbw that a certain amount of progress has
been made with the rudimentary work of
Federation, the struggle for the possession
of the Federal capital may be expected to
break out again at any moment. In fact, it
is a cause of surprise that it has not broken
out already. Each province of the Federa-
tipn has hopes, more or less vague, that its
capital shall be made the seat of the Federal
Government; the smaller cities only desire
it as one who yearns after the impossible,
but Sydney and Melbourne are prepared to
claw after the distinction to the bitter end.
The struggle is not merely for the honor of
possession, for the ownership of the Federal
City means a great deal in the way of solid
cash advantage. The Legislature of the
Commonwealth will be situated there ; so
vvill the principal Government offices, the
head-quarters of the railway department
and the military forces ; and innumerable
casual hangers-on of the State. The prin-
cipal railway workshops will probably gravi-
tate there in course of time ; also the State
arsenal, arms and ammunition factories, the
State Bank and the State Insurance Depart-
ment when these come into existence. When
this country begins to recover from its de-
pendence on the British money-lender, and
to conduct its own financial business and
rely on its own resources, the Federal
city will become one of the principal
financial centres. If either Melbourne or
Sydney is selected as the seat of Govern-
ment, the head offices of private banks and
companies will gravitate towards the Federal
City, and its rival will become, in a financial
sense, a place of secondary importance. To
become the capital of Australia would pro-
bably mean an increase of 50,000 or 100,000
population in a very few years ; a great in-
crease in rents and land-values ; a glorious
boom ; and a permanent accession of wealth
and importance. Therefore the possession
of the capital is something worth struggling
for, and, as the scramble must begin shortly,
The Bulletin takes this opportunity to
suggest a possible site for the seat of Govern-
ment and to advance its reasons for selecting
the same.
This paper’s theory is that the Federal
capital should be built—not taken over
ready-made. As one possible location it
suggests the shores of the Darling River in
the west of New South Wales, somewhere in
the gruesome neighborhood of Menindie ;
and as another it desires to draw attention
to the sultry regions of far Western Queens-
land among the head waters of the Gregory
River. The central parts of Australia may
apparently be set aside as a hopeless locality
by reason of the deficient water-supply, but
possibly as good a site as any could be
found in the Northern Territory at the
back of the desert, somewhere about the
beginnings of the Victoria River. Also,
there is a promising situation on the
Murray just where the three provinces of
New South Wales, Victoria and South Aus-
tralia meet- -a position which would gratify
three provinces and could not aggravate
more than four. The Bulletin makes
these suggestions in a perfectly serious
spirit, and for many good reasons. Austra-
lia is a vast country, thinly peopled and
weakly defended, and, despite its good for-
tune in the past, it must reckon, like every
other country, upon possibilities of invasion
in the future. One of the most important
duties of the Federal Government will be to
provide for national defence, and with this
end in view it should not be planted either
at Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide,
Perth, or any other seaport, where the first
successful inroad by a foreign enemy would
scatter the Government into the bush, and
make the whole machinery of the State run
for the foothills. Such a disaster would
probably involve the abandonment of the
State papers and records, the dispersal of
the Legislature to the four winds, the cap-
ture of the principal military stores, and the
dislocation of everything, just at the time
when the State machine most wanted to be
in good working order. Moreover, it will
be absolutely necessary for the Federal
Government sooner or later to set up its own
arms and ammunition factories and its own
arsenals ; no country can safely depend on
importations in these matters, for the time
when munitions will be most wanted will be
when its ports are blockaded by an
enemy and supplies are unobtainable, and
when a general European war has created
such a demand that foreign makers cannot
keep pace with it. In other words, the only
time when Australia can confidently depend
on a foreign supply of munitions is when
they are not wanted, and the only time when
the supply is certain to stop short
is when it is wanted most of all. The natural
site for the Federal arsenals and ammunition
factories is at or near the capital, so that they
will be under the immediate control of the
authorities, and the natural site for the capi-
tal is as remote as possible from the coast,
so that some enemy arriving on a raid won’t
capture these essentials at the very beginning
of the difficulty, and leave the country prac-
tically defenceless.
Wherever the capital is located, there will
necessarily be a great increase of population.
A large array of State departments will be
concentrated there ; also the Legislature ; a
part, at least, of the military pomp and cir-
cumstance, and many other things ; and a
great number of shopkeepers and miscel-
laneous tradesmen will rise up to live on this
access of population ; and other people will
rise up in due course to live on them in their
turn. In Melbourne, Brisbane, Sydney,
Adelaide, or any other existing town or city,
this would simply mean a great increase
in rents and land-values for the benefit
of the private monopolist, and it would
also mean the purchase at inflated
values from the private monopolist of land
whereon to build new offices to accommodate
the concentrated machinery of Government.
But if the Federal Government creates a new
capital in a wholly new locality it can begin
by acquiring a few hundred square miles of
country from the provincial authorities at
prairie value, if, indeed, the province is not
prepared to cede the required space gratis in
consideration of the benefits it would
indirectly derive from the establishment of a
large population on its empty borders.
Within this territory the Federal Govern-
ment could be the sole ground landlord for
ever. As population increased throughout
Australia the Federal city would grow in
size and importance, and the ownership of
the soil would become a magnificent source
of revenue with unlimited possibilities of
expansion. The building of the capital is
the best opportunity Australia ever had, or
probably ever will have, to try an experi-
ment at Land Nationalisation on a large
scale, and work that experiment for all it is
worth ; and if it fails to seize upon the
opportunity through apathy, or a slavish
respect for precedent, or an inability to
comprehend the greatness of the oppor-
tunity, it will have cause to regret its neglect
for ever afterwards. /
* * * *
There are also many other reasons why
the new seat of Government should be
built at the further edge of nowhere on
the road to the setting sun—or something
equally vague. Its establishment, wherever it
may be, will, as already mentioned, create a
large population, and the dim interior wants
population badly. The coastal cities, on the
other hand, have already far more than their
share. The capital of United Australia will
naturally become an important railway
centre, and if it is planted on the furthest
end of the existing railway system, or beyond
the present furthest end, it will create new
activity where it is much needed. At present
no railway has penetrated the interim of A us
tralia because there was no place for 1 °S°
to save a blank spot on the map, no popula-
tion to serve, and no goods or passengers to
carry. Moreover, the only great market
is in the coastal cities, and even if the rail-
way had readied the far interior, and had
found something to carry from there, the
immense distances and heavy freights would
make agriculture hopelessly unprohta >e.
If a city arose in this wild region, agricul-
tural and pastoral industries would grow up
around it for the supply of its inhabitants,
and irrigation would make it an oasis in the
wilderness. It would be a case of bringing
a large population alongside the far-out pio-
ducer instead of placing it on the coast 10U
miles away from him, and thereby it would
give the interior lands the start for want ot
which they have always been languishing.
Also, it would bring the eye of the
Government-Jo bear directly on a region
which badly heeds its fostering care and
supervision. A Government located on the
coast knows practically nothing about the
necessities for irrigation and artesian well-
sinking, for locking rivers and conserving
water, which are the great troubles of three-
fourths of this continent. It can only learn
about these things in any satisfactory fashion
by personal observation, and as the pro-
blems can’t be brought to it for personal in-
spection the next best thing is to plant it
alongside the problems, wdiere they can t
possibly escape its attention.
* * * *
The establishment of a big centre in the
interior would help to create a scientific
railway system throughout Australia. All
attempts at constructing a transcontinental
line to open up the interior have failed,
greatly for want of something to rest upon
towards the centre. The population of the
interior has increased at a miserably slow rate
compared with that of the cities on the coast,
and the transcontinental lines had no place
to make for save the other side of the con-
tinent. All the great lines that strike
directly inland start from some town or city
beside the sea, and die away for want of
nutriment somewhere far inland, like an
over-long fishing-rod which gives way at the
thin end through being too far away from its
only base of support. The politicians who
discourse so much about the opening up
of the interior should consider this view
of the case ; the only way to open-up
the interior is to accumulate population
there, and one chance to create a big centre
of population here presents itself. The same
argument applies to the other stock saying
about opening up the mineral resources of
the country. As an example, the Northern
Territory, one of the richest and best-
watered regions of Australia, is rich in
mineral wealth, which, so far, has come to
little or nothing, mainly because it is 1000
miles from any place in particular. If it
became only 500 miles or less from some
place in particular, that empty land would
probably begin a new lease of life and start
on an altogether novel burst of prosperity.
There would be a new centre from which all
manner of industrial prosperity could start;
it would be a case of carrying civilisation
further out than it has yet been, and even
far outside the Federal district there would
necessarily be a considei’able increase of
population, which would be a source of
revenue to the adjacent provinces.
/ * * * *
All this, of course, would have to be gained
at the expense of much temporary discomfort
to the Federal Government. If the site of
the new capital was beyond the present
limits of railway construction a line would
have to be extended in the first place to
enable the Government to reach the scene of
its labors, and when it got there it would
have to live among the primitive surround-
ings of its partially unbuilt city until the
great experiment took shape through the
expenditure of much toil and money and
perspiration. But, after all, it is only the
same experiment which the United States
Government successfully carried out when it
built its capital city of Washington, and it
undertook that work with a smaller popula-
tion than Australia now possesses, with
little money, no credit worth speaking of,
and at a time when railways were still
unheard of and communication was slow and
difficult. And, whatever may be thought of
the other alleged advantages of the proposed
location, it offers sundry benefits which are
beyond dispute. It places the machinery of
Government, the Treasury, and the State
arsenals where they can’t be captured or
scattered to the winds at the first landing of
a possible invader. It solves a problem
which is bound to arise out of the rivalries of
the various provinces each desirous that its
own capital shall be the seat of the Federal
Government. It affords a fine opportunity
for an experiment in Land Nationalisation
on a large scale. And, incidentally, it will
afford much employment—of a profitable
character, in The Bulletin’s opinion—and
it will tend to diminish the enormous con-
gestion of population in the already over-
large coastal cities. All of which are matters
which call for much hard consideration. y
PLAIN ENGLISH.
An Ignorant Rag.
Few papers fake ’ and misrepresent statistics
with quite such a glaring disregard of truth or
probability as the Melbourne Foreign trade
and Single-tax organ, the Beacon. In i ts
issue of January 1, that paper strikes a new
theory about the horrors of Protection. Th<
people of New South Wales, it alleges, ar<
better fed than those of Victoria ; each Corn*
stalk consumes annually bushels of wheat,
1270 z. tea, 1121bs. sugar, llloz. currants and
raisins, over twenty gallons spirits, and 460 z.
tobacco ; while the Victorian gets only 5}
bushels wheat, llOoz. tea, 9‘2£lbs. sugar, 98oz.
currants and raisins, 18& gallons spirits, and
35-1, oz. tobacco. Then the lying organ
whoops :
It follows, therefore, that New South Wales, because it
is more prosperous than Victoria, can import more goods
and yet manufacture more goods locally than \ ictoria
can. ' The same increase in consumption, only very much
larger was witnessed in England after the abolition of
the protective system. Protection, by increasing prices,
and at the same time reducing wages, reduces consump-
tion wherever it is adopted.
The Beacon’s figures are partially correct so
far as they go—most of the wilful misrepresen-
tation comes in when they stop’going. To finish
the story (as told on page 300 of Coghlan’s
“ Wealth and Progress of N.S.W.”) the Vic-
torian consumes annually 971bs. more potatoes,
rather more coffee, and when wine, beer and
spirits are reckoned—not spirits alone (page
306) —one-tenth of a gallon more alcohol than
the cornstalk. Also, when all the different
varieties of eatables are added up (except
salt) the Victorian gets 10031bs. -of solid
food per annum against the N.S. Welsh-
man’s 9861b5. Also, by the same table the
cornstalk is worse fed than the Queenslander,
Tasmanian or Maorilander. Further, the wheat
statistics are a gross exaggeration, and the sugar
item is pure invention, the balance there being in
favor of the Victorian. Therefore, the Beacon
stands convicted of being a stupid and clumsy
per verier of the truth, and its statistics are of
the same value as Foreign-trade statistics in
general. The Beacon, by the way, is generally
supposed to be in some way connected with
Max Hirsch, the author of the “ Fiscal
Superstition,” a work which, as The Bulletin
had the pleasure of demonstrating when it
appeared, had hardly one reliable fact or figure
in its whole composition. And a hand which
looks very like that of Max sticks out in the
Beacon’s statistics, where each cornstalk is set
down as consuming 20 gallons of spirits alone
(per year, presumably, the other items being
for the year) whereas he consumes less than one
gallon, and the Victorian is credited with
drinking 18 gallons instead of less than three-
quarters of a gallon. If the Beacon’s figures
were correct these provinces would be one long,
wild, awful delirium tremens ; and as they are
they stamp that paper as the most pitiably
illiterate rag in Australasia.
“Federation Critics.”
Mr. Arthur Rae replies to a recent Bulletin
criticism as follows :
Dear Bulletin, —In the “Plain English” columns ot
your issue of the 11th my letter published in the Daily
Telegraph of the 21st December is subjected to a severe
keel-hauling. Your article, as a whole, is most unfair.
Firstly, although destruction may be more easy and
simple and look more beautiful than construction, as you
allege, and while the destructive critic may look more
powerful and eloquent, and so forth, than the'other fellow,
yet that has not been the case so far as Australian Federa-
tion is concerned. On the contrary, that great and im-
portant question has been glorified and gushed and slob-
bered over by every greasy groveller and tuft-liunting toady
in Australia, since Federation was first seriously mooted.
It isn’t the “ easy ” and “ simple ” work of the destructive
critic which has delayed Federal Union in Australia, but
the hypocritical snuffle, the effusive “loyalty” and pas-
sionate yearning to get further “ under the Crown,” on
the part of the average Federationist, as well as the
general National Ass principles on which they proposed
to construct the Federal Constitution which has hitherto,
disgusted many Australians and sent the rest to sleep.
Secondly, I must inform you that I don’t object to Federa-
tion “ because there is no provision for putting a Foreign-
trade minority on top.” A Freetrader might logically
object to secure the certain defeat of his own fiscal prin-
ciple by handing it over to a majority who held different
views. On that point, however, any costly and complete
system of Federation would, to be successful, fall far short
of either the Protectionist or Freetrade ideals, as a big
revenue tariff, which is neither one thing nor the other,
is inevitable to meet the Federal expenditure, plus direct
taxation for State purposes and more direct taxation for
the smaller form of Local Government. Where will the
saving come in? If it gives us cheaper loans, then
the curse of living on borrowed money is only
strengthened. If, as The Bulletin urges, it is
cheaper to have one Australian Governor than seven,
and easier to abolish the one than the seven, then
where does the beauty of a Federal-system come in which
carefully maintains the seven provincial vice-royalties,
with all their attendant “society” crawlsomeness, and
adds another, bigger, more costly and .more crawlsome to
the existing seven ? You say, “There is no remedy sug-
gested for this obvious difficulty,” except waiting for the
backward provinces to catch up. So far as the Federal
franchise is concerned, it seems to me the one tHin<>- for
which we should wait, as, on the character of the fran-
chise depends the possibility of future progress. If, how-
ever, the Convention provides for, and the several pro-
vinces accept, a uniform single-vote system for the
election of the Federal Parliament, then, personally I
don’t care a fig what franchise the local State elections
are held under, as that will be their own individual
funeral. Re the name of “ Senate ” or “ State Council,”
that may be a small matter,-but the mode of its appoint-
ment is of great importance. You say that I suggest no
remedy for the difficulties in the way of securin'*-
an ideal system of Federation. Well, what is the
matter with the idea of liberalising and extending
the scope of the present Federal Council, now dormant
and always nearly useless throligh the mother province
declining to join in V That council might have made Aus-
tralian Federation an almost perfect evolutionary growth
from the primitive to the complex. If that course is now
impossible, surely a time-limit for the proposed constitu-
tion would provide a simple and effective means for
reconsidering the position, and, if necessary recasting
the terms of union. Anyway, while admitting that Growth
and improvement will always be necessary, I should not
be accused of enmity to the principle in endeavoring to
render that development possible and easy by having the
foundations laid both broad and deep. h

In reply The Bulletin has a very few remarks
to make : (1) It still believes that Federation was
retarded mainly by public indifference. Outside
a small section of the population in a few big
towns it doesn’t believe that the people knew
either the slobbersome aspect or aw other aspect
ot Federation, and it is confident tnat not one
person in 100 ever heard about the ‘‘‘loyal”
features of the proposed Federal Constitution.
(2) l he Bulletin is glad Mr. Rae doesn’t object
, Prospect of the Commonwealth being Pro-
tectnye if the majority so decides. His letter to
the Telegraph, however, conveyed a wholly
different impression. (3) The fact that Federa-
tion will give us cheaper loans doesn’t necessarily
mean more borrowing. There are £200,000,000 of
the PerW W i h A Ch P ersisten % falling due, and if
cent it d w-u (x °, vernment can reuew them at 3] per

that it isn’t the name but the constitution of the
Upper House that is important. Then why was
he worrying about the name? (G) Finally, how
could it be any easier to develope the
pre-tent Federal Council into a Parliament than
to make a new Federal Parliament? The first
developments must be to make it an elective body,
to decide on what franchise it shall be elected, to
fix the number of members and apportion them
among the provinces, and to define the Council’s
new powers. That is just what the country pro-
poses doing. The process of developing the old
Federal Council and that of making a totally new
one are exactly the same, and Australia is now
doing whichever of the two Mr. Rae prefers. The
old Council is a small, narrow, purely nominee
body ; how could it be developed into a demo-
cratic institution except by the same processes
that are now being attempted ? “ Development ”
in this case is only an important-looking word
like “usufruct,” or “ Mesopotamia,” or “ Ilelio-
gabalus.”
Moving Them On.
An English religious paper called the British
Weekly has started out to incite the miser-
able English sewing-girl to embark for the
Promised Land of New South Wales. The
following is a fine slab :
I had an interesting conversation some days ago with
Miss G. A. Edwards, of Sydney, who is well-known in
New South Wales as the founder of the Sydney Working
and Factory Girls’ Club. Miss Edwards probably knows
more than any other woman of the conditions of the Aus-
tralian labor market for women. She mentioned that
many of the factory girls marry at l(i. One of them re-
marked to her : “ We’re all on the shelf at IS.” There
are in Sydney over 4000 girls employed in factories, and
as the colony cannot yet provide a sufficient number of its
own workers, there is a considerable field for immigra-
tion. “ Since I came home,” said Miss Edwards, “ I have
seen much of the factories and business houses of Loud >n,
and when I find girls earning Is. Bd. for making an
elaborate blouse which will sell in the West End for three
or four guineas, or earning 4Jd. for covering a picture hat
which will ultimately be sold at 305., I cannot help asking,
Why should they not emigrate ? From the first our
club has had the warm support of the Governors of
the colony and their wives. Lady Carinotox was
our first friend; Lady Jersey and Lady Duff have
also shown the warmest interest in the girls. Many
factory girls in Sydney spend their evenings in dancing
saloons, and in walking about the streets with doubtful
companions. At the club they have a comfortable home
provided for them at the cost of from 7s. to 10s. weekly.
Wages in Sydney are much higher than in England. A
good tailoress can earn from two to three pounds weekly.
Less efficient workwomen earn in the great tweed factories
from 15s. to 355., while the very lowest sum paid to
beginners is 10s. a week. The factory girl’s day begins at
6.3 J. They go to work, unlike our London ’Arriets, with-
out their hats. Not that the Sydney girl despises feathers,
but she keeps them for more festive occasions. Half an
hour is allowed for breakfast, and an hour for dinner,
and the working day ends at half-past 5. The long even-
ing, so much brighter in the Australian climate than ours,
is thus at the girl’s disposal, and it is one of the most
serious problem of Sydney life how to make the best use
of these hours of leisure.”
This is a fine sample of the mendacity of the
British religious paper. There are not
over 4000 girls employed in factories in
Sydney ; including Sydney and the adjacent
districts, and reckoning girls, women, old
women, very old women, and toothless bel-
dames in general, the whole number of
female factory workers, according to last
census, is only 2900. The alleged 4000
factory girls don’t habitually marry at 16;
out of the half-million females in N.S.
Wales, the whole number of married women
under 17 at the latest count was 127. Also,
the Sydney tailoress doesn’t earn, as a rule,
more than one-half of the alleged sum ; and the
beginner gets nothing, or 2s. 64. or ss. per week.
If she gets much over ss. it generally includes
being hugged by her male employer. There are
no “ great tweed factories ” in Sydney. And the
picture of the girl who gets up at 5 a.m. so as
to be at work at 6.30, and gets off at 5.30 in the
evening, not knowing what to do with her
superabundant leisure, is a wild vision. What
does anybody who works 11 hours a day do with
his or her leisure ? If Miss Edwards is a real
individual, and if she really told these awful
taradiddles to the British Weekly to induce
the British workwoman to come out to this
land of hard toil, low wages, scant work, sweat-
ing, and depression, then she has a lot to answer
for. The Briton has one standing remedy for
all kinds of suffering—to move the sufferer on
to somebody else’s premises, and drop him
gently on somebody else’s doorstep, and let him
starve somewhere where somebody else will be
anuoyed by his emaciated remains and have to
pay for the inquest. Meanwhile, the wild
assertions attributed to the alleged Miss
Edwards, of Sydney, are interesting reading.
The Protected Foreigner.
An embarrassing aspect of the New South Wales
Income-tax turned up last week and threatened
to make trouble between the GoD-fearing
Ministry and the importing interest. Accord-
ing to the Act, when any foreign merchant or
producer sends goods to N.S. Wales for dis-
posal by his agent, it is to be assumed that 5 per
cent, of the proceeds represents profit. Possibly
the real profits may sometimes be 25 per cent,
instead of five, and the figure assumed by the
Act is therefore about as moderate as anybody
could desire. This 5 per cent., being income
earned in New South Wales, is to be subject to
Income-tax at the usual rate of 6d. in the £, so
that foreign goods sent to Sydney for sale will
be subject to a duty, through the Income-tax
Department, of half-a-crown for each £IOO
value. An agitated deputation of importers
pointed out to Premier Reid that this impost
was “calculated to restrict trade,” and
Reid agreed that it was so and promised that
the law in this particular respect would not
be enforced. One inference to be drawn
from this is that the law is a thing to be en-
forced or not just as the Premier, or his boss,
the great aggregate importer, pleases. But the
most interesting point is the tender care exer-
cised over the smallest interests of the foreign
dealer. If a Sydney merchant imports goods
and sells them, or if a New South Wales
manufacturer makes goods and sells them, or if
a farmer or pastoralisb drags produce out of the
ground and sells or exports it, the profits made
thereby are subject to income-tax, in the usual
way. But if a foreigner sends goods to the
province for disposal through his agent, his
profits are exempt from even this small impost,
and if he lives and spends his money in a
country where there is no income-tax, he, there-
fore, gets so far ahead of the local man.
Just now there are 25,000 tons, or there-
abouts, of wheat en route from California to
Sydney, and the profits made by the sale of it
will, according to the new reading of the Act,
pay no tax whatever to the N.S. W. Treasury !!
But the profits made by the cornstalk farmer
out of his grain will pay the usual per cent,
income-tax, and the land on which he
grows his produce will pay Id. in the £
per annum on its capital value, and if he
is located far back, with many miles of
railway carriage between him and the capital,
it will cost him a heavier freight to land his
produce in Sydney than it costs to carry the
American farmer’s grain from San Francisco to
the same city !! ! Under all these conditions,
Premier Reid’s anxiety to exempt the foreign
consignor from the humble impost of 2£ per
cent, on the profits of his New South Wales
trade is a touching sentiment. The amount of
the exemption may be small, but, at all events,
it is all the exemption that the circumstances
admitted of. And the arrangement which pro-
tects the foreigner who lives and spends his
money abroad, and merely consigns goods to
New South Wales, against the local importer
who, at all events, spends his profits in the
country, is a case of carrying the Foreign-trade
principle to the very last extremity. Even the
local Foreign-trader is discriminated against
nowadays because he isn’t foreign enough.
No-Liability Companies.
The Bulletin lately called attention to the
damage the No-Liability Act does to legitimate
mining. What is wanted, it was contended, is
a provision declaring that a certain percentage
—say 20, 30, or 40—of the company’s capital
shall be actually available for prospecting and
mining. At the opening of the year several
lists which had been prepared were published
with the purpose of indicating “ Lhe marvellous
growth of Westralian trade.” From one of
these lists a table of deadly significance has
been compiled, as follows :
It will be interesting to note the direction in
which some of these companies spend their
£2OO or £5OO in a country where water is from
6d. to 9d. a gallon, and where the bicycle
expressman’s fee for posting the engineer’s
report runs up to half-a-crown. Indeed, it is
interesting to speculate how much of the
£2OO or £5OO is left after brokers’ commission
and “printing and advertising prospectus,
printing scrip,” &c., are paid. Here are a
couple of companies, each with a capital of
£120,000, the shareholders in which have
actually paid up £375. It was so little
that it was not worth putting to the
credit of the co., and so the vendors took
the lot. Wherefore these £120,000 mining
co’s set out to develop their (of course) excel-
lent prospects upon—nothing. True, in these
two cases all the shares have to contribute (or
forfeit); but in some others the vendors’ shares
are fully paid up, so that the few contributing
shareholders have to carry the whole of the
burdens. For a certainty most of them neither
can nor will pay calls ; they only buy the shares
on the strength of a possible rise, and if the
shares don’t rise they simply forfeit. And they
call this mining ! Presently (speaking of the
system, not of the individual mine) when the
grocer calls round, the shareholder who has not
been able to sell curses “mining” as loudly as
his broken voice will allow. Admittedly mining
is a risky business, but that surely is no reason
why Legislatures should give men facilities for
making it the pretext for a mighty gamble. In
fact, if mining is risky, but if nevertheless it is
a thing to be encouraged, the sensible course, it
would seem, would be to reduce the risk as
much as possible by weeding out gambling
concerns which are obviously only masquerading
as mining companies.
That Irish Regiment.
Cardinal Moran, in achieving the nucleus of
an exclusively Irish military corps in New
South Wales, is true to an early prepossession.
While imperial, like his uncle, he is in practice
insularly patriotic. He believes in saints, but
in Irish saints in particular ; in orators, but in
Irish orators particularly ; in poets, but par-
ticularly in Irish poets. The denominational
schools of Ireland were very well managed for
over half a century by what were known as
Christian Brothers. The order was a French
one, but it was manned by Irishmen, and was
generally considered to be racy of the
soil. The Cardinal, however, at that time
a humble ecclesiastic, objected to have
Ireland instructed from a French source,
and as soon as he obtained episcopal power he
created an Irish order of the same brotherhood
and established their schools in his Irish diocese.
Thus, owing to him, there are two distinct
orders known to the world as Christian
Brothers. To what good ? One order in which
all nations might blend would to many seem
preferable, just as would one army in which all
patriots would coalesce. Differentiation is some-
times good, but historically it is a bad principle
when applied to nations. The isolation of
Ireland has been a fault, and if perpetuated
will be a curse. The setting-up of an ex-
clusively Irish regiment in New South Wales,
notwithstanding that similar regiments exist
in Queensland, Victoria, and elsewhere in
Australia, is in a small wav doing with Irish-
men what in a large way English rule has per-
sistently done. And the result has been that
the Irish soldier doesn’t know the English one
or the Scotch one, and they don’t know him,
and, when ordered, they blow his brains out as
being something worse than a wooden-shoed
foreigner. Nothing is clearer to the thinking
man than that the salvation of the world
depends upon the working-classes of the world
—whether the bearers of scythes or swords—
having an intimate knowledge of one another’s
sufferings. With this knowledge under his cap
Fritz won’t kill Jacques, Jacques won't kill
Paddy, however loudly crowned despots yell or
partisan prelates bless or damn. Rather, they
will stand together and, clubbing their rifles,
batter the brains out of despot and prelate.
Anything, therefore, which makes for isolation
of nationality in Australia should be laughed
down as a hoax, and, if found serious, be con-
demned as a crime.
Jingo.
Melbourne Punch : “ Were the Empire in
danger to-morrow not a colony of the many
that owe their birth to England but would
freely and gladly strip itself, if need be, of
men and money, to beat back the mother
country’s enemies.” Here the query naturally
arises—what men and whose money is the
Punch man willing to strip Victoria of in the
good cause of Jingoism? Does he propose to
borrow the money so that this generation will
get all the whoop and the glory, and the tem-
porary boom which would arise through the
influx of coin, while the long, dreary bill is left
to posterity ; or is he willing to see the income-
tax put up to ss. in the £ with no exemp-
tion, and a land-tax of, say, 3d. in the £
levied, also without exemptions, and perhaps a
poll-tax of 10s. per head per annum piled on
top of it all, so that the people who get the
medals and the knighthoods and the glory in
the papers will also pay for the proceedings ?
And, as regards the men, does he propose that
other people should go to the gory front while
he stays behind and is paid for writing articles
about their doings, or is he going himself? And,
in the latter ease, how' does he like the prospect
of giving up his billet in the city, and the
salary, and the theatres, and the iced-drinks,
and going out to carry a heavy rifle and knap-
sack on long marches in some arid land, and
camping out under the damp, rheumatic stars,
and coming back a cripple —if he comes back
at all —with his writing arm shot off, and find-
ing that someone else has got his billet, and
there is no demand for a half-man anywhere,
and getting a medal and possibly an allowance
of 2s. 6d. a day from his grateful country ? In
short, is he going to sacrifice himself and his
money for the glorious empire, or is he only
willing to float a loan and sacrifice someone
else ? This question is the great Jingo problem
in a nutshell.
The conflict of opinion between the Sydney
police and stipendiary-magistrate Whipping-
dale Johnson over cabman Darwin’s method
of disciplining his refractory child merely
touches the fringe of what is a really great
question. The tendency of the age is unques-
tionably in the direction of saving children
from corporal punishment. Several countries
have specifically abolished the use of the cane
in schbols; under the Board in England
assistant-teachers are not permitted to
cane, and head - masters and mistresses
who inflict such punishment must make
an official entry of the fact, and record
the principal circumstances of the case.
An almost identical rule prevails in the State
schools of several of the Australias, while all
over the world the teacher who can control his
pupils without an appeal to corporal punish-
ment is set up as an example for his class to
follow. With this tendency so clearly marked
where trained officers of the State are con-
cerned, it is matter for surprise to find an ex-
perienced magistrate declaring in open court
that the police were morbidly sympathetic in
prosecuting a father for chaining by the legs
and welting with a belt-buckle his nine-year-
old child. School-masters, like policemen,
are expected to possess control over temper ; if
they do not possess it to a high degree they
stand small chance of promotion to the sole
charge of children. On the other hand, any
man, practically speaking, is permitted by law
to become a father. Thus we have the genius
of the time taking the power of inflicting cor-
poral punishment, even the mildest hand-caning,
away from trained officials, while law-adminis-
trators of the Wiiipfingdale Johnson type
endow the man who achieves a child, though lie
has given no proof of control of temper or dis-
ciplinary training, with the right to corporally
punish it to an extent which, as in the Darwin
case, the police and medical evidence testified
to be excessive.
The first witness called by Vic.’s Fat Man
Council was a bootmaker, who declared, in ’94,
that if other makers paid less than statement
prices he would at once tackle his wages sheet
and see he got his work done at the same
prices. He now declares that a law-fixed wage
must be unfair, and that to display wages rates
in legible characters on the walls of every
factory (as prescribed in the Assembly Bill)
would be equal to disclosing his whole business.
Which is a serious hint that the whole business
of a manufacturer is to “ tackle his wages
sheet.” That bootmaker is a protected manufac-
turer, encouraged by the State on the innocent
supposition that he and his pals would do the
decent thing by his employes. Now that the
law that called him into existence as a manu-
facturer proposes to regulate him as a manu-
facturer, he squeals. Neither sandshifting,
alias Freetrade, nor Protection, is much good
without the Minimum-Wage.
What are the Commercial Principles that are
belauded down South as the secret for big State
undertakings ? Commercial principles are sup-
posed to oust patronage and jobbery in appoint-
ments and promotions. Can anyone name a
bank, or a warehouse, or a shop in Australia
run with or without commercial principles
where patronage and influence are not essential
to appointments and promotions ? One Mel-
bourne bank keeps a billet or two for good
cricketers, because the manager is a crank about
the game. Put that manager on the Railway
Trust and he will instinctively, and with the
most honest intentions in the world, proceed to
keep an eye open on behalf of some rising bat
in a junior team who would play for the M.C.C.
if —•. Take any man in Australia and give him
the bestowal of billets, and his friends will find
his weak spot —it may be his church, or his club,
or his position in society—but weak spot he
has, and somebody will touch it. This is true
of private as well as publio fat billets—only it
is probably more so with the private dispenser
of patronage. There is hardly a grocer or
draper in Australia who has not handicapped
his business by making a manager of his incom-
petent son or his weak-kneed nephew-
If Australia takes in the smiling Japanese as
per schedule of proposed treaty, numbers of
frayed goody-goodies will be able to grab hand-
fuls of ripe evangelical employment. Without
naming the nastinesses goody-goodies like fin-
gering, there is a wealth of open sin about the
brown man quite exhilarating to an average
evangelical maid. For instance, Koko knows
nothing about a Sabbath. Never once did his
nation hear of it—except as a barbarian obser-
vance. His mills work on Sunday, his shops
stay open, his workmen labor. From 12 to 17
hours his nation toils daily, and the idea of
idling all in a body on one particular day of the
week strikes him as an absurdity as great as if
a nation went drunk on one day in seven.
This is a clean prejudice, but it will take Aus-
tralian tabbies years to uproot it.
The Boer is again triumphant. The battle of
Kruger’s Dorp was won by straight shooting ;
“dour fanaticism” and “deep religious feel-
ing ” are all frill. Likewise, any resemblance
which may exist between Oom Paul’s braves
and Cromwell’s Ironsides has little bearing
upon the matter. To Australians this Boer
business conveys two lessons. First, that the
most necessary men in bush fighting are men
who can shoot straight; and, secondly, that
Australia hasn’t got them, or, at least, not
enough of them. The defence forces are large
enough for a church-parade or a midnight-
tattoo, but not to protect our enormous coast-
line, even if they were equal in skill to the
Ivanoffs or Fritzes, or even t,he little
monkey-men of Japan. The young Australian
rides, pulls, and pedals in pursuit of fame and
trophies, and, given sufficient inducement, he
will take to rifle-shooting as a duck takes to
water. Let the various Govts, foster rifle
clubs and offer prizes for good markmanship,
and in a short space of time we shall have a
nation of sharpshooters who could effectually
oppose the invading forces of any power likely
to land on our shores. The art of war for
Young Australia is chiefly contained in three
words, “ Learn to shoot.”
The Yic. law cast a humorous light upon itself
the other day in a matter concerning a humble
sneak-thief and a fiddle. The fiddle was an old,
commonplace article, and it was pawned for
ss. When the thief was convicted, the pawn-
broker pleaded that he shouldn’t lose the ss.
advanced, as he had acted in good faith, but a
Melbourne bench of magistrates ordered him to
hand it over, and told him sternly that he
should have known better, as the prisoner
“ didn’t look the sort of man who would be in
honest possession of a fiddle.” Then, in its
usual illogical fashion, it stopped short,
in order to conceal its ignorance. If the
bench knew how a man looked when he
looked like a man who wasn’t likely to own
a fiddle, it must also have known how he looked
w r hen he looked as if he was likely to own
such an article ; it stands to reason that it
couldn’t know that he didn’t look like a man
with a fiddle unless it knew how a man with a
fiddle could be expected to look. And when it
knew how a man looked when he owned a
fiddle it should have given a description of him
so that future thieves might be detected. If
the miserable pawnbroker had been equal to
the occasion he would promptly have asked
how a man ought to look when he owned a
fiddle, and then the bench would probably have
discovered all of a sudden that it was only an
ass trying to look intelligent, and have covered
its confusion by having him run in for con-
tempt.
Ed. Bulletin, —Industrialism has slain feudal-
ism, but the dying giant left a Nessus’-shirt,
which, if not soon destroyed, will prove the con-
queror’s bane. It is steeped in the bad blood of the
old monster. We call it the principle of inherit-
The man who accumulates wealth is,
generally (at least, if we believe the polito-
nomists), whether he will or no, a great bene-
factor of man. The man who inherits it is
usually dangerous to man. Why should the
principle of “ consideration ” not be applied to
the transfer of property by will and in
intestacy, as to other transfers ? Kill inherit-
ance and you strip capitalism of most of its
evils, you effectually prevent the formation of
dangerously large landed estates, you remove
enormous premiums on incapacity, you burn
the roots of undesirable caste-mangroves, you
make the marriage-problem soluble, and you
make it possible that the survival of the fittest
shall mean the survival of the best. Inherit-
ance is the nucleus of the germ-plasm of caste.

Dear Bulletin, — I am prepared to main-
tain that on W.A. goldfields no decent woman
can live without either losing, to a great extent,
her own self-respect or her sense of respect for the
opposite sex. She will not be interfered with—
true; but she will be simply ignored. The
filthiest expressions are commonly used, despite
the presence of one, two, or 20 women. Ordinary
bad language might be passed over; but it is
impossible to pass over one particular word known
as the “W.A. adjective.” Scores of “ t’other-
siders,” as well as “ natives,” who wouldn’t use
this expression in Little Bourke-street, use it
freely in their conversation in streets and public-
houses over here. Certainly, it is comparatively a
few men who offend, but there are quite enough of
them to make the goldfields —I speak for the Mur-
chison as well—unfit for decent women to live
and work in. Coolgardie itself is improving,
although the barmaids, for instance, are st ’ prac-
tically unprotected. In all other centres a few
low whites can wag filthy jaws as long as they
like.—D., Coolgardie.

Opera House.. Rickards’ Variety Co.
Alexandra “ The Roll of the Drum.”
“The Work Girl,” at Sydney Royal,
belongs to the common or hunky variety of melo-
drama in five acts. It opens with a bell-topper
rolling in a cellar, the owner thereof having been
killed by the evening-dress villain and dropped
down a trap-door into the river, while his hat
bounds on the damp floor as a silent witness
of the tragedy. The rest is mainly a new and
damaged version of the “Silver King,” the hat in
the cellar being a temporary departure into
originality. The hero is brought to grief at the
same old Derby, by the same old schemer who
was mashed on his wife before he married her.
The variations are that he gets into gaol instead
of into Colorado, and comes back stone-broke to
warm himself at a baked-potato can on a bridge ;
and as his wife has died in the limelight he is
only looking for his daughter. But Scot Inglis
dresses the character as an exact copy of the good
old “King,” with the traditional long coat and
white hair, and the handkerchief round his neck,
and borrows a shilling off his lost daughter on
the bridge with a wild expression in his eye.
There is something that is intended to be
humorous, but which is only coarse, in a scene
where six girls tear Sweeney’s pants off; and
there is something that is probably intended for
dramatic intensity in another scene, where a
fashionable lady tries to horsewhip the pathetic
Harrie Ireland—the lost girl, who has been fished
out of the river and has hardly had time to dry.
* * • »
Except in the last act, which has a lot of
go in it, and some vigorous assault and battery
on a stair, “ The Work Girl ” is a drama of bitter
commonplace. There is very little humor in it,
for the bulgy Jew leprosy who cries out “mum-
bling Moses !” in moments of excitement is not
funny, though he is possibly meant to be.
Besides, he is a weak and futile Jew, who is con-
stantly swindled in the most infantile fashion by
everybody. The airiest person in the show is
Westmacott’s larrikin. Harry Plimmer, who has
improved greatly of late, does good work as a de-
cayed person with a secret locked up in his hairy
chest; Scot Inglis is a fine, pathetic prodigal;
and Hazlett is an artistic villain, though the bell-
topper in the cellar finally bowls him out. Also,
Misses Harrie Ireland and Florrie Forde are all
that this paper’s fancy painted them. The rest of
the. cast is an innumerable caravan of plain non-
entities. The drama is otherwise adorned with
the most utterly repulsive young female who ever
wore ap expensive silk dress on the stage, and
tried to,cane a distressed sister; also, by a fruit-
barrow and a high-kicking ballet; and there is a
scene in a sweater’s workroom —only, as nobody
seems to work, the moral gets mislaid. Still, Miss'
Josephine Thynne comes to apply foi a billet, and
when she doesn’t get it ? she smacks the bloated
proprietor severely—which is something.

“ The Passport,” supposed to present some
vague resemblance to Savage’s ‘‘Official Wife,”
and which really does resemble it just as much
as a curate resembles an Armenian massacre,
Opened a promising career at Sydney Lyceum on
Saturday. As to the humor of it there is no
manner of doubt; the first night was a con-
tinuous howl of laughter, and the large-nosed
female in the d. 0., who explains the play to her
deaf aunt as it goes along, broke herself up in her
efforts to make things understandable to that
afflicted relative by 9.30. There are many things
in “ The Passport ” to be thankful for. One is
that the Russian police do not undress Brough on
the stage, after all, to see if he is disguised in
what they candidly mention as “a false stomach;”
they rush him several times with the obvious
intention of undressing him, but their attention is
fortunately diverted each time, and 1 ’.rough is finally
undressed in an adjacent room. And when Miss
Watt-Tanner, as a weeping mother-i i 1 -law, beseech es
Cecil Ward to make Miss Hilda Spong change
her stockings whenever she gets i er dainty feet
wet, Ward judiciously takes it for granted that
her feet are dry up to date. And when another
lady hands back to her jealous husband the jewels
he gave her, and makes a suggestion about also
handing back the clothes she received from him,
and which she has on at the moment, th jy tor-
tunately beoome reconciled in time to preveii t this
alarming sacrifice. “The Passport” is b ised
principally on a grave suspicion that Cecil Ward
has committed bigamy with Miss Spong; that
Mrs. Brough has done the same with Boucicault,
and that her first husband is not really “ slumber-
ing in the thingumbob ; ” and that Miss Hardy
had been a lady of bad character in Russia, and
Ward’s first wife —a lady of very loose morals—
isn’t really dead. And when all these matters are
cleared up without the Russian police undressing
Brough in public, the result is a big success all
round.
* * * *
Dot Boucicault, in a very small character,
is the most artistic spot in the drama. Boucicault
is undoubtedly the most versatile and most finished
actor in Australia, and even the smallest
character, in his hands, becomes a thing worth
remembering. Also, he is the only man who has
a different smile every time. Brough and Cecil
Ward are sufficiently successful in the two biggest
parts, and Mrs. Brough is exceedingly good as a
beautifully-dressed lady who rests under grave
suspicions. Dorrington, as a lengthy idiot, does
well enough, and all the other ladies are quite satis-
factory, Miss Spong only excepted. The fair
Hilda has not learnt the art of weeping success-
fully, and her habit of putting on her stage com-
plexion in a large blob under each eye is dis-
appointing ; altogether her performance falls con-
siderably below some of her previous efforts. But,
taking the 00, all round, there is little to complain
of, and the fact that Brough isn’t undressed by
Policeman Majeroni would cover almost anything
if need be.

A lot of new songs and new music have
been worked into the pantomime at Her Majesty’s
(Sydney), and it is rather better for the change.
A pantomine is a thing that developes as it goes
along, and when it gets into its fifth week it is so
utterly unlike what it was in its first week that
only the name holds the two productions together.
Miss Luella and Mr. “Bobby” Watson —it is
truly awful to belong to a profession where a
grown-up citizen must call himself “ Bobby ” for
humor—-have added a lot to their parts, and im-
proved things generally. Also, by way of further
variety, Walter Rivers manfully played Saturday
the other night with six stitches in his head, he
having fallen down somewhere, or over some
place, or something of the kind, and broken him-
self in three pieces just before the performance.
* * * *
Sydney Music Hall has been closed re-
cently, on account of the “ heat-wave ” or some-
thing, but promises to re-open to-night (Thursday).
J. Driscoll Foley, who left a good record behind
him as the crawlsome Irish attorney in “ Pat,” at
Sydney Royal, will appear as “ the celebrated
monologue entertainer, ” and if he monologues as
well as he crawls he should be a person of value.
* * * *
Two more of Rickards’ new artists, the
Cosmans, dropped in at Sydney Tivoli last Satur-
day, and a lot of the old ones, notably W in ton,
the ventriloquist, did some good work. There
seems to be no end to Rickards’ new importations;
the head of the procession arrived in Australia
long ago, while the tail-end isn’t yet at Suez, or
anywhere near it.
* * * *
Another co. proposes to try its luck at
Sydney Criterion next Saturday, when proceed-
ings will begin with the comedy “Hide and Seek.”
Wilfred Shine and “New Boy” Ralph Roberts
are two lights of the new venture, and the ghosts
of the last two enterprises which tempted fortune
at the Cri. will be round on Saturday night to
wish them all manner of luck.
* * *• *
Melb. Alexandra, under Dan Barry’s
management, has struggled back to life rather
sooner than was expected. On Saturday the alert
campaigner hoisted the British Flag for all that
sacred emblem is worth at Haleck prices, and the
result justified his daring. Previously Daniel had
excited the populace by advertising for 100 hideous
supers, to impersonate Boers. The 100, or more or
less, ugly men rolled up and were engaged to fall
in heaps of slain as often as the band played
“Rule Britannia,” which they did in a praise-
worthy manner. The scene of the Flag’s triumph
is laid in the Johannesburg district (according to
the programme), and it is vaguely understood
that Tommy Atkins wipes out the combined
armies of France and Russia, in addition to
decimating the Boers. Altogether, “ The Roll
of the Drum,” is a fine moral military drama.
The enemies of Great Britain seem to be a
thoroughly bad, deceitful lot—especially Augustus
Glover—whilst the Queen’s gallant troops are
persons to feel proud of. Miss Dora Mostyn, as a
lion-hearted drummer-boy, and Wilson Forbes, as
an unyielding colonel, do wonders for Hingland in
the hour of need ; but Glover and other evil-dis-
posed foreigners chiefly help to push along the
smoky story. “Roll of the Drum” contains a
good deal of plot, as well as battle and noise and
stage-management, and if Emperor William will
kindly resume his bellicose attitude of a fortnight
ago Dan Barry’s drama will run for the next six
months. Much depends on Emperor William and
the cable-liar.
* * * *
No change in “ Djin-Djin ” stock at Melb.
Princess’s. Several large parcels of seats have
been placed during the past few days, and small
buyers are rather more eager than ever. In fact,
the present output of eight performances per
week is barely sufficient to meet the demand,
therefore rumors of “Djin-Djm’s” early ship-
ment to Sydney may be ignored. The healthy
tone of the chorus is maintained, also the
beauteous ballets are quoted in high terms of
admiration, and although the earthquake always
falls heavily it recovers its former position every
time, and will be a Firm attraction until further
notice. The Bulletin’s blessing—which passeth
all understanding, and which neither moth nor
rust can corrupt—rests upon “Djin-Djin ” as
usual.

The Royal pantomime was doomed to dis-
appear on Wednesday of this week, and the ver-
dict is death from starvation. A cheerful trans-
■formation scene, a merry little leading lady, a
satisfactory ballad songstress, and an acrobatic
dog, were about the only popular features of
George Coppin’s hungry show. The other features
represented a reduction of economical principles
down to the “ one straw a day ” policy which slew
the farmer’s steed, in the old fable. Last Satur-
day, manager Coppin told his audience that the
>anto. he assisted to produce at the Royal, 50
years ago, didn’t cost more than =£4o a week,
whereas, nowadays, one might easily achieve a
nightly loss of that amount. But the veteran’s
little story of olden times had nothing to do
with the case. He himself produced a costly
pantomime four or five years back, and made
money by it, although the same show wouldn’t
have paid expenses when he was half a century
younger. But no matter. Somebody from St.
ivilda won a gold watch with his coupon on Satur-
day. This jubilee souvenir presented by the
early father of Melbourne pantomimes, and in-
scribed accordingly, deserves to be laid carefully
aside until it becomes a famous theatrical relic.

At the Opera House crowded houses are
now saluting Alice Leamar’s bicycle and cheering
their beloved Rickards with considerable fervor.
Melbourne’s drain-germs attacked the perenniai
Henry as soon as he returned from Hingland, yet
the fact that he feels pretty bad before and after
his performance makes no appreciable difference
in his form on the stage. J. F. Robin, from
Amurka, seems to be on good terms with
multitude, and the rest of the bill gets a favorab
reception.
*# * *
Leonore Orelli, the Firm’s latest recruit
from the amateur opera brigade, is unfavorab y
contrasted with Juliet Wray by such people as
would draw comparisons between Titheradge ana
Elton. The abnormally self-confident Juliet is
a dasher, well suited to French comedy par s -
She has scored in “ Angot, ’ “ Nitouche, Mas-
cotte” and “La Belle Therese.” Her style is
bold, her enunciation strong, distinct and harsh,
and her singing method is bad, so bad that it will
knock her thin voice to bits if not speedily im-
proved. And probably it is beyond hope of cure.
The Orelli is quite a different case. VY hen she
and Juliet played Josephine (“ Pinafore ) ( one
night apiece, at Melb. Princess’s she was the
quiet one,’’ whereas her rival, in bright blue satin,
was “ the cheeky one.” Orelli was distinctly the
more promising girl for sentimental heroine
characters. Her personal style, voice and vocal
ability will bring her to the front if her health
permits, as a Patience, Marjorie, Princess Ida,
Bohemian Giurl, or anything in the same ime or
business. Already she is a more graceful debu-
tante than the original Florence Young, likewise
a much more intelligent elocutionist. Her speak-
ing tones ought to grow loud enough in a little
while, and then the only objection to Miss O. will
be her curious enunciation. She doesn’t exactly
lisp, or slur her words, but her mannerism of
talking is odd and foreign to the ear. Yet it isn t
unpleasing. If she gets along well as a singer and
actress this peculiarity will find professional
imitators. At present it has the negative virtue
of uniqueness.

P.: When is a pantomime to arise without a male old-
woman part? The sausages, geese, and hot pokers of old
pantomime hive practically disappeared, but the vulgar
man in white socks and petticoats stays on—a drivelling
anachronism. No one thinks the pantomime old woman
is funny—many people think their neighbors think it
funny. It is not the she-male’s hideous vulgarity that is
most awful—it is its criminal want of humor.
Christchurch is the city most dreaded by pros, visiting
Maoriland. Approval there means prosperity right
through. Disapproval spells damnation. Most com-
panies nave been damned in Christchurch.
Eth i Haydon, writes The Bulletin’s London corres-
pondent, makes but a poor Shop Girl. Her acting is
indifferent and her voice small, whilst she is lacking in
the spontaneous vivacity absolutely necessary in burlesque.
If she had only the “ go ” of a Cissy Loftus she would
with her undeniably good looks, be quite a star of the
first magnitude. The Gaiety is not, by any means, a good
school for a pretty girl, and it will take all mamma’s
vigilance to keep the johnnies (and Georges, too for that
matter) at arm’s length. It is to be hoped that the report
that Ethel has captured, and is about to annex in the
holy bonds, a South African millionaire is true.
London Sketch : “It is a pity that pretty Miss Ethel
Haydon, who sings charmingly, has not greater skill in
taking advantage of her beauty.”
The stately Geraldine Oliffe, late of the B and B Co
is now playing in London in “Mrs. Ponderbury’s Past”
Thus George Bernard Shaw, in the Saturday Review ■-
A Miss Oliffe, whom I do not remember to have seen
be ore, conies very near making an artistic success in the
title-part, only missing it by a few unhappy lapses into
clowning at the crucial passages, according to the trad -
tion of the English stage, where people are always so
carefully taught by the stage-manager to force the fun
and spoil it. If Miss Oliffe would only try the effect of
playing the part with absolute sincerity throughout, and
without slackening her grip, absolutely refuse to g"ve
away her handsome style at any moment for the saki of
raising a silly heehaw by a grimace or an ugly sound or
gesture, she would distinguish herself considerably ”

According to Ada Crossley’s special organ, the Bmtish

London correspondent, too much reliance must not be

lutely unprejudiced witness.
Miss Bennett, who has been Melba’s factotum for some

Will Johnson, the colored basso of “ One Hundred!

tralia, died of dropsy at Sydney Alfred Hospital, the

While all the best of Pollard’s girls are Maorilanders,
the principal hoys are Melbournites. The only exception
is Quealv, the comedian, who plays the Widow Twankey
in “ Aladdin,” Cogia in “ Ali Baba,” Rocco in “ Mascotte,
Cadeaux in “ Ermiuie.” He is a Bananalander.
Three of the local milita-ry, high up, were admitted
behind the scenes of a big Sydney theatre the other night,
as a privilege, you know. The supers waited till the
heroes were interested in an actress or two —then they
chalked the martial hoofs. The dauntless three were
each enclosed in a chalk circle, bearing the inscription 2s.
Cd. Soon the supers spoke in stage-whispers to each
other, “A oaser! a caser ! my kingdom for a caser!”
The answer came, “ ’Sdeath, Humphy ! Yon treacherous
dog, borrowing my caser to bury his baby, and the
grizzling monster has put it down his hissing neck!”
After five minutes of this, the soldiers barked. Then the
actresses mollified them with the good old legend, “ I
feel hj nervous when you are watching me and every-
body was satisfied. “Never offend the army,” Farren
use dto say. “ They are generous when they have it, and
they are always harmless.”
The veteran actor Gladstone, a relic of theG. Y. Brooke
era, has taken up his residence in the Dramatic Home at
Northcote (Melb.). Mr. Gladstone was a subscriber to the
funds since the inception of the institution.
Kenneth Mackay, M.L.A. for Burrowa (N.S.W.), has, in
conjunction with Alfred Dampier, completed a drama en-
titled “ The Golden West,” which will shortly be produced
at one of the Sydney theatres.
Harry Payne, the Drury Lane clown, died with £6OOO to
his credit. One bequest in Harry’s will was funnier than
any of his old Xmas jokes. It provided the sum of £lOOO
in trust for a certain Mrs. Sam May, “ with power of
appointment thereof in favor of all, or any one or more, of
her children, or reputed children.” In theatrical circles,
seemingly, it is a wise child that knows its own mother,
apart from the everlasting doubt as to papa’s identity.
R. S. Smythe regards Holy Land Haskett Smith as by
far his ablest lecturer, though worst financial spec, last
year. Mark Twain produced most cash.
Lecturer Charles Clarke is next on R. S. Smythe’s list,
and he will arrive at Easter. His new discourse is on St.
Paul’s Cathedral.
Bernard Shaw disputes the prevalent theory that people
go to the theatre to be amused and pleased. Says he :
“ They want to be excited, and upset, and made miser-
able, to have their flesh set creeping, to gloat and quake
over scenes of misfortune, injustice, violence, and cruelty,
with the discomfiture and punishment of somebody to
make the ending ‘ happy.’ The only sort of horror they
dislike is the horror that they cannot fasten on some
individual whom they can hate, dread, and finally torture
after revelling in his crimes.”
Charles Godfrey, the “ lion comique,” comes out shortly
to Harry Rickards. Godfrey began at 15s. a week at London.
Elephant and Castle, playing innumerable parts weekly.
Now, the music-hall business brings him about £l2O a-
week.
“ Every man has been in love with an actress.”
Rignold has a notion of acting Joseph in London.
The Duke of Clarence, afterwards William IV., settled 1
£lOOO a year on Dora Jordan, the actress, Duke of Fife’s-
ancestress. He wrote to her, asking leave to reduce it to-
£soo. In response, she only tore off the last line of the-
Drury Lane playbill, and enclosed it to him : “ No money
returned after the rising of the curtain.”
Chance for the understudy. Miss Vanbrugh was put
out by being understudy for an eminent London actress,,
having to sit in the wings night after night looking at
her, without a chance to go on. Bourchier was the lead-
ing man. Suspirating over the leading lady’s shoulder,,
he fell in love with the understudy and married her.
Mrs. Keeley’s two daughters, Mrs. Albert Smith and!
Mrs. Montagu Williams, were very much alike. After'
Mrs. Smith had been left a widow, a gentleman came up.
to her laughing, at a party, with, “ Your husband wishes
me to apologise, because he is detained in a dreadful!
place.” He meant that Montagu Williams had not been*
able to get away from the Old Bailey.
Ernest Payne, the N.S. Wales cyclist
hy the Wheelmen’s League to represent
N.S.W. at Adelaide in the one mile international
contest, is a muscular, 21-year-old, unmarried
athlete, who, standing sft. in. in his socks, and
weighing list. 41b. in condition, can do a hard
day s work beside almost any man. He got biked
two years ago, and three months after learning he
won a mile race and £5 prize at Lillie Bridge.
Subsequently he won a similar race at the same
place. Then last March he got away with a big
Tl. n 7 le !W^ ne .y Wheel Race and =£loo cash prize.
At last Austral (Melb.) meeting, starting 20yds.
from scratch he won the Victorian mile (=£2o);
xVi/iV 1 , start he won the mile-and-a-half
M.B.G. plate (£4O). Last Boxing Day at Sydney
Agricultural Ground, on scratch with Lewis,
Megson M limes and O’Brien, he won his heat and
the final; he beat Lewis in the final and beat him
again m the mile. New Year’s Day he rode in
style, eclipsing the other N.S.W. scratch men by
wmnmg the half-mile (=£10) handicap at the
Highland Gathering. Payne is also a good
swimmer, having won eight prizes for distances
from 100 to 200yds. He has also won a few foot-
races, although he doesn’t affect to be a ped. at all.

I he Bank of Victoria, whose net profits have
oeen swindling every previous half-year since December
93, has apparently turned the corner. The net profits
*? r JQ® half ended 3i s t Dec., ’95, are £20,631, which is
it than its last record, and though this is done
solely by reduction of expenses, and not by increased
earnings, still it amounts to a lot. A dividend at
the rate of 5 per cent, per annum is paid on the prefer-
ence shares, absorbing £10,419, and the other £10,200 is
arried to the credit of profit and loss, making a balance
to the good of £26,761 accumulated during the last 21
years. The eternal piling up of cash still continues, the
Victoria having now £1,666,000 of coin and Government
securities, or £250,000 more than it had six months
ago, with no liabilities worth speaking of to meet
until June 1898. During the half-year the paid-up
capital has increased by £45,000 ; the note circulation has
gone up £24,000 ; the deposits have increased by £BO,OOO ;
and there has been a general and cheerful improvement
allround. There is not, and never has been, any infor-
mation from this bank as to the amount of its recon-
structed deposits, so it is impossible to tell how they are
getting on, but, judging from such appearances as there
are, it ought to be able to make a general release shortly.
Also, the statement that “ bills receivable and other
advances are £6,075,829 is a great deal more remarkable
for the energetic way the big row of figures is planked
down than for the information they convey.
The Royal Bank of Queensland still lives up to
its good reputation of the past. It has made a net profit for
“ ™ontlis e ? ded 31st Dec -> ’95, of £6033, against
£5946 last half, and £6476 the one previous. A dividend
of 2b per cent, per annum absorbs £4218 ; £l5OO is added
co reserve, making it .130,000, and, after paying dividend
tax, there is £lO3 (.allied to credit of profit and loss.
The ‘ deposits and otner liabilities ” have been reduced
from £741.,000 to £719,000, by the repayment of another
eighth of the reconstructed funds, which makes one-
fourth of the old fixed deposits paid off. How much
remains can t be ascertained, for the Itoyal lumps together
reconstructed deposits, new fixed deposits, c irrent accounts
and other liabilities ” in one big item, • nus conveying
the smallest possible minimum of inforn at ion. Also, it
lumps together bills payable, mortgage s, and miscel-
laneous advances in the same fashion. The coin, bullion,
and Government securities have increased during the
half-year by £3200, and now stand at £241.671, and, with
this great amount of cash on hand, it . urns surprising
that the Royal doesn’t release its re-constructed deposits
bodily. Under the scheme of arrangement, the Royal is
bound to add one-fourth of its profits to the reserve-fund
every half-year, and, if it adheres to this wise provision,
it must become, some day, one of the strangest banks in
Australia. Also, it wisely keeps its reserve separately in-
vested in Government securities, so that it is a genuine
affair, and not a mere book-entry, as is 100 often the case
with such things.
♦ * * *
The Trustees, Executors and Agency Co. (Mel-
bourne) publishes another unhappy-loc vug balance-sheet.
The receipts from the co.’s regular bm mess of caring for
the estate of the widow and orphan and the deceased have
amounted during the half-year to 14175, and against this
it has paid £4499 in ordinary working expenses and £250
under the head of allowance to the widow of the deceased
manager. Therefore, according to the figures in the
balance-sheet, the agency business has been a serious-loss,
the best feature about it being that it isn’t so large a loss
as that of last year. The receipts have fallen off by £2OO,
but a saving of £6OO has been made in working
expenses—hence the improvement, such as it is. The co.
sets down the value of its freehold property as 65,000,
and the amount received from it in net rents (after
deducting rates and repairs) is just £44 13s. 4d. A lease-
hold property in Queen-street, Melbourne, costs for the
half-year £315 more than the property produces. The
co.’s offices are mortgaged for £25,000, and it holds
£35,000 invested with which to pay off the mortgage
when it falls due ; but it apparently pays £lBl
more interest than it receives, so that the
loss on this item is at the rate of. £376 per
annum. The said investment of £35,000, by the way, is
represented by £lOOO deposited in the Bank of Victoria ;
£20,000 deposited in the Australian Deposit and Mort-
gage Bank (worth about 15s. in the £ on present quota-
tions) ; and £14,000 worth (nominal) of preference shares
in the same disastrous institution. The Australian
Deposit and Mortgage Bank was in a very bad way when
last heard from, and its preference shares, so far as can
be judged from the absence of quotations, seem to have
no present value at all. Yet, as the same “ 435,000 set
aside to meet mortgage ” has appeared in the balance-
sheet for a long time past without alteration, there would
seem to have been no writing down of this alarming
“ security.”
The Trustees, Executors, and Agency Co. has
just written £45,000 off its reserve, to cover depreciation,
apparently under the heading of “ loans on mortgage,”
“foreclosed mortgage,” and “fixed deposits,” for the
last two amounts have disappeared from among the
assets, and the first has been written down 60 per cent.
But the freehold property and the £34,000 located in the
Australian Mortgage and Deposit Bank, both look as if
they might want writing down badly, and the £40,000,
which are all that remain of the reserve, may need
to be applied in this direction. During the year the
co. seems to have sold or got rid of £3300 of deben-
tures, and the only asset remaining which looks really
liquid is £lO,OOO worth of inscribed stock. The interest
received is £450 less than last half, and equals £4 7s. per
cent, per annum on the investments, but whether this
has all been collected, or whether the outstanding por-
tion is included in the “amounts due to the c 0.,” which
is £llOO more than it was last half, and, if so, how much
this outstanding portion amounts to, don’t appear. The
net profits for the six months are set down at £256, equal
to 17s. per cent, per annum on the paid-up capital, and,
when the writing-off of £45,000 is set against this, the
result isn’t cheering, and dividends are naturally sus-
pended. Said £45,000 is alleged to have been “ trans-
ferred to a contingent account ” to make “ full provision,
not only for the fall in the present value of securities, but
for other contingent losses which may arise,” but this
seems to be merely a gentle way of putting it, for no con-
tingent account appears in the balance-sheet, so the
amount would seem to have gone to write off losses
already ascertained. Also the statement about “ losses
which may arise ” calls up the ghost of the £14,000 worth
of preference shares, which don’t appear to be provided
for in any way.

The New Zealand Insurance Co. publishes an
announcement of its dividend in another column. The
full balance-sheet now to hand shows that the net lire
and marine premiums were £267,916 for the year, being
nearly £3OOO more than last year, and the profit is
£32,953. Against this, however, £27,500 goes in dividends
and bonus ; £6500 to cover depreciation account (and as
the actual depreciation ascertained during 1895 was £8523
this account is somewhat worse off at the end of the year
than it was at the beginning); and £5OOO towards the
sinking-fund on the co.’s Auckland city leasehold; so it was
necessary to take £6OOO from last year’s balance to make
things level. Last year it was necessary to take £6OO
from the previous year’s balance for similar reasons.
Under these circumstances the 12£ per cent, dividend
may be justifiable, but the 1 j per cent, bonus certainly
isn’t. The N.Z. Insurance Co. has a part of its £235,000
reserves in shares, and if these have any call liability upon
them they may make this big concern sit up violently
some day. Also an item of £2647 in Argentine Govern-
ment securities is more or less interesting. Argentine
securities are a lot safer than Confederate bonds certainly,
but beyond that there is little to he said for them.

The Universal Permanent Building Society
(Melb.) announces that it has lost £3557 in a year’s work,
whereas last year it lost only £2967. This quaint institu-
tion has alleged assets to the amount of £287,000. Its
office property is mortgaged for £29,000. It has two over-
drafts to ballast down its other assets. It has nominally
£158,000 worth of house and land property, which yielded
last year, after paying expenses, £413, or a little over ss.
per cent., and, as people don’t buy property at a price
which only yields ss. per cent., the present sale
value is something worth thinking over. Its list
of assets, as published in the Record, doesn’t
include one penny in cash, or even one postage-stamp. It
owes £134,000 to shareholders, £72,000 to debenture-
holders, and £20,000 to depositors. Also, during the
year, the amount owing by borrowers has declined from
£97,000 to £67,000, and, when this liquid asset is ex-
hausted, there will apparently lie nothing for the Uni-
versal Permanent to do save sit down hard and look at
its alleged £158,000 worth of property. Meanwhile, it is
a fine example of the modern Australian building society
which lives and moulders in the hope of another boom
where there is no boom on the furthest horizon.

Bendigo Mutual Permanent Land and Building
Society announces a profit, after transferring £2OOO to

The very small and obscure Town and Country Building
Society (Melb.) reckons its year’s profits at £l3B—equal to
about £1 17s. per cent, on its capital of £7524. Which
items suggest that the Victorian building societies outside
the boom-stricken capital are much better off than those
within it ; that the Melbourne societies which didn’t go
booming but stuck religiously to legitimate business are
doing reasonably well even now ; and that part of the
damage done to the building society business has been
through the existence of too many microscopic institu-
tions which aren’t big enough to justify the outlay on
office-rent.

The National Trustees, Executors, and Agency
Co. (Melb.) presents a balance very unlike that of
one of its rivals in the same line of business. It
has £30,000 capital and £23,400 of reserve fund, and it
reports the handsome profit of £3OlB for the year 1895.
And with that beautiful sense of the fitness of things
which characterises so many companies, 'it spends £3OOO
in paying a 10 per cent, dividend, and, after writing £l7
off its office furniture, it has exactly £1 left towards pos-
sible depreciations on £43,000 worth of mortgages and
other investments, at a time when depreciation is at its
very worst, and very few securities can stand too close
inspection. In 1894, the same co. earned £3003, and
when it had written £l9O off its furniture account it
made up its 10 per cent, dividend by taking £lB7 out of
its previous year’s balance. And, in 1893, it made a profit
of £4466, and cheerfully paid away £4500 in a 15 per cent,
dividend which, with allowance for depreciation, necessi-
tated taking £5B out of the funds of 1892. A co. with a
good business and good chances which goes on in this
dreadful fashion deserves the worst that can happen to it.
The eighteenth annual report of the City
Mutual Fire Insurance Co. (Sydney) is an eminently
pleasing document for the shareholders. The net pre-
miums, after allowing for returns and reinsurances, were
£13,531, and the fire losses were only £2263. This result
the management ascribes solely to the persistent rejection
of all proposals coming from people with names ending
in “stein” and “berg” and “hoff”and “ sky,” and
similar, suspicious terminations. The premiums are a
trifle more than last year ; the losses are 13333 less ; and
the profit (£6875) are £2BOO better. The City Mutual
gives back £1536 of its profits as a bonus to insurers who
haven’t combusted during the year; pays a 10 per cent,
dividend (£1500) ; adds £2OOO to reserve-fund, making it
£12,000 ; makes sundry allowances for depreciation, and
carries £1478 forward. The only feature which hasn’t
improved is the investments ; last year £25,000 invested
yielded £1165 interest, and this year £27,500 yield only
£1029, equal to 3J per cent.

The balance-sheet of Cairns (N.Q.) Municipal
Council for half-year ended June 30, ’95 (published in the
local papers Dec. 31, ’95) is a t.vpioal illustration of the
way they manage things in Q.N. Bankland. Cairns has a
population of something under 2000, and the municipality
owes Govt. £9025 and the Q.N. Bank 15336—total',
114,361. It collected during the half-year £402 in rates ;
spent £262 in salaries, £265 in street-repairs, owed the
Govt, interest, and added the Bank’s interest to
the overdraft. Its assets consist of £2441 arrears
of rates mostly bad ; £8 9s. 4d. worth of
“ goat-collars and dog-tablets,” and other plant and
materials (including a dishonored cheque for £l4
12s. Bd.), totalling a trifle over 1 900. It has a cash
balance of 3s. 9d., and a balance of liabilities over assets
of £ll,OOO 9s. 6d., and doesn’t feel in the least alarmed
about it. It has the Bank at its back, and Govt, is
at the back of the Bank, and Cairns backs the Govt.
And this cheerful three-cornered fashion of backscratching
goes on all over Kanakaland.

The chairman of the Smelting Co. of Australia
told a meeting of shareholders in London that, on the
advice of Mr. Howell, they had bought the White Rock
mine, the lode of which, according to Govt, reports, was
500 ft. wide, worked by open quarry, and they were well-
advised that, in this mine, they had a most valuable
asset. By-the-by, there are two or three items which are
sure to be mentioned at some future meeting—that the
White Rock was floated for a million, and, at that price,
was the greatest “ wild cat ” in N.S.W.; that over £70,000
was spent on it in plant alone ; and, with all, the mine
could not pay working-expenses, with silver 40 per cent,
above its present price. It is a gigantic lode, but to call
it 500 ft. wide is a gigantic cram.

Garibaldi G.M. Co., Hillgrove, said to have

Money has arrived to clear off a mortgage and to pay

The Eleanora, Hillgrove, is steadily progressing.
The present manager is giving more attention to concen-
tration than to the erection of additional stamps, 50 of
which are lying on the ground—which is better than being
erected—and idle, as they undoubtedly would be. The
next move will be to concentrate the vast heap of tailings
of former years. They are known to contain payable
quantities of gold, besides antimony, while the quick-
silver thus saved should go a good way towards cost.

Broken Hill exports last year were valued at
£1,960,980. Silver ore was valued at £587,265 ; bullion at
£959,562; silver ingots at £57,804; copper matte at
£21,230. These, with £ll2 for copper, comprised the
metal exports-aggregate, £1,625,963. In 1894 these
exports were valued at £2,249,628—£500 for copper matte,
£644,896 for ore, £1,543,038 for bullion, and £61,194 for
silver ingots. The figures are not, however, conclusive,
chiefly on account of the new basis of valuing the ore
that has been adopted. Thus it is stated that 189,133
tons of ore were exported. Much of this was concentrates,
one ton representing, say, four or five tons of ore. Then
purchasers of ore return its value net, or, at the most,
put the full value upon only that proportion of the metal
which they expect to extract; whereas, in the past, when
companies exported on their own account, the gross value
was returned upon the assay value of the ore.
The Broken Hill official figures relating to
mineral exports—figures which N.S. Wales Statistician
Coghlan and the Mines Department take over—
have never been satisfactory ; in some cases, through
credit for the’ value of metal being taken twice
over—once on export at Cockburn and again on export at
Sydney—the figures in the blue-books are tens of thou-
sands out. At present there is nothing to distinguish ore
from concentrates, and the value is returned on half-a-
dozen different bases.
While =£1,625,963 is declared as the value of
Broken Hill mineral exports for ’95, the dividends paid
out of profits by B.H. co’s amounted to £732,588 ; and
the Junction, Block 10, Block 14, South, and others,
besides adding to their reserves, have spent very largely
on new machinery. On the figures, the actual working of
the mines has not, even in this comparatively bad year,
absorbed 50 per cent, of the gross receipts ; and for every
pound paid in wages to miners and mine workmen at
least a pound has been paid to non-resident shareholders.
By the removal of the duties on rough timber,
dynamite and blasting powder, salt, chemicals, chaff,
feed, grains, oils, and candles (in part), the B.H. Proprie-
tary Co. expects to save about £20,000 a year. Last year
the B.H. co’s—which get almost all their supplies from
S. A.—paid £9957 duty on rough timber, £4lOO on salt,
£1350 on explosives, and £l5OO bn candles.
The extension of the open cuts and still more
recently the working of the larger and generally more
compact sulphide bodies has led to a big reduction in the
B.H. Co.’s timber-bill. In ’93 the imports amounted to
19,442,471 super, ft., valued at £121,969 ; in ’94 they were
17,524,942 ft., valued at £104,727 ; arid last year 13,280,171 ft.,
valued at £77,902. Still, it is a mistake to suppose that
all the sulphide bodies are compact and require little
timbering. There may be trouble in this direction. The
Junction’s new body, for instance, requires a forest of
wood, and even then it is none too safe.
In 1893 the 155,099 tons of ore exported from
Broken Hill was valued at £924,290. The 189,133 tons of
ore (and concentrated ore) exported in 1895 was valued at
£587,255.
B. South looks particularly well again— i.e., it
has tremendous bodies of from low and medium grade lead
sulphide ore in sight. The weekly output to the concen-
trators is 1200 tons.

A local correspondent tells The Bulletin that
the largest amount of gold for many months, 3600 z., left
Hill End per escort on Bth Jan. This includes the
amount forwarded by the A.J.S. Bank, and includes the
results of all crushings of interest, but does not account
for all the gold won in and around Hill End and Tamba-
roora, as the Chinese storekeeper and others are con-
siderable buyers. Wren and party crashed 80 tons for
16oz. (six weeks’ work for four men). Then came Paxton’s
Tributors, 37J tons for 87ioz. (12 men, eight weeks three
days). Burns and Graham’s Tributors, 7 tons for 340 z.
(20 weeks, one man and two boys). Carver and party, 12
tons for 27ioz. (six men, five weeks). Star of Peace
Tributors, 30 tons for 430 z. (five men, 14 weeks). By none
of the parties mentioned was more than £2 ss. per
week made, while 15s. was the lowest.

Under the heading of “A Return of Sixty

C. G. Warnford Lock, manager of the Went-

on “ Economic Mining.” It is worthy of the attention of
mining novices and amateurs : mining men will find little
in it that they did not know before, but can find in it a
mistake or two to laugh at. Here is one : “ The only two
sources of precious opal are Hungary and Mexico, the
product of the former being far the more valuable.”
The writer had an idea that precious opals were found
in Queensland many years ago, and since then at White
Cliffs and other places.

Wattle Flat (N.S.W.) goldfield, though never a

cats in the first rash, but the field might now repay a
little attention from outside. The other day, Cox and
Peak struck on the surface an inch leader, which at 10ft.
was nearly 6in. thick, and from which they took £3OO
worth of gold in three days. Two dishes picked from the
vein, and washed in the presence of a Bulletin corres-
pondent, gave about lOoz. gold. The leader threatens to

is left for The Bulletin to add that £35,000 is also a fine
price to pay for any mine in a- country where mines are
rich one day and poor the next. “ Find a mine, watch,
but do not touch it,” is the great W.A. motto.

description (which was what the big heap of milky stuff
at Bayley’s was to go). Not a word of the fact that the
Premier mine has been working for over two years, that
it has always had a small crushing plant, but never a div.
That it may pay now is the writer’s hope, although the
lode will need to be better than when he saw it.

At Woolgangie, the present terminus of the

taken from the festering waterhole where the people of

Railway building has got down to such a fine

these terms the unprogressive Government doesn’t see it,
because the Esperance Bay line would take business away
from the dank and festering city of Perth and might
create a rival city on the south coast.

The outrageously bogus character of some of the

comprising some notable personages, immediately resign.
It is said that they are not responsible for the statements
in the prospectus, and that they declare they have been
deceived. Be that as it may, they should have insisted
upon having everything before them before consenting to
become directors. Whatever the W.A. fields may turn
out this year —and big returns will cover up a mountain
of corruption—they won’t be big enough to stop a revela-
tion of public robbery in London, the obtaining of heaps
of money by false pretences, of great crimes in which pro-
minent men have lent a helping hand, but for which the
law provides no punishment. No wonder Westralia is

Dear Bulletin, —A friend in Westralia writes
me that he has been given a job on the lease of a British
syndicate with five or six others who are fulfilling the
labor covenants by trenching for the reef. “ Not one of
us would know a reef if we ran up against it,” he says,
“ but if we do happen to collide with anything that looks
something like what we imagine a reef ought to be, we
will bring down the cook to examine and report. The
cook is accounted an expert, because, years ago, a brother
of his ran away, and is reasonably supposed to have gone
mining somewhere.” Kalgoorlie is evidently a fine

An erstwhile Sydney resident returned,
the other day, to the city of the Beautiful Harbor
ere departing for England. He had been in
Westralia for under two years and had cleaned up
for some =£30,000. He was the only survivor of a
party of four—all of them well under 40 years of
age.

Gov. Brassey told an interviewer the other
day that he knew the young German potentate
“ so far as it is possible for a humble individual to
know an emperor.” The humility of Brassey,
when discussing the refulgent greatness of crowned
heads, is alike instructive and touching. It
teaches one that the meanest Smellbourne occu-
pant of a four-roomed cottage is not further away
from Government House than Brassey is remote
from any himperial throne.
Captain Guise, the Evangelistic member of
Gov. Buxton’s staff, is letting his light shine
before Adelaide even brighter than the boss’s.
The captain is a Plymouth brother, or something
almost as dreadful. On the voyage out he quite
eclipsed Gov. B. (who always read the Lessons on
Sunday) by holding a prayer and Bible meeting
every blessed morning ‘‘ on his own. ” A few women
used to attend the meetings regularly and pour
out their beautiful “experiences ” to one another,
whilst the four clergymen aboard were exchang-
ing funny stories on the quarter-deck. Indeed, it
was generally reported that Guise and his tabby
party never groaned forth their final “ Amen ”
until they had called the attention of Heaven to
the parsons’ absence and besought Providence not
to make things very, very hot for them in the life
hereafter. Ordinary sinful passengers took a good
deal of umbrage at Captain Guise, one way and
another. They even complained of his incon-
sistency in rigging himself out as an Arab chief-

The society belles of Tasmania (the same
old lot) are overjoyed at the arrival of Admiral
Bridge and his ships, and have arranged a series
of hops for the delectation of their patrons.
Meanwhile a deputation of matrons has privately
waited upon the Admiral with a long-standing
grievance, which avers that the officers of H.M.
fleet make no matrimonial proposals so far as
Tasmania is concerned. Cyprian has promised to
“speak to them about it,” although, from an
official point of view, and in the general interests
of the navy, he “ feels bound to disfavor mar-
riage. ”
Lady Clarke, who has been vice-president

He was a Q. State school inspector, and she
a married female teacher, whose school he was
examining. He asked her for the books of record,
and on her telling him she had left them at home, he
sent her for them, and went on with his examination.
Then, dismissing the school, he, in accordance
with the instincts of his craft, took up a vantage
point—an ambush—whence he could watch the
female teacher’s return. He saw her, as she came
along, hesitate, stop, throw the books into some
bushes, and come on again. As she entered one
door he slipped out of another, secured the books,
and marched into the schoolroom with an air of
triumph. She stood cowering—all confusion. He
said, very severely: “You haven’t kept these
books properly ; you tried to deceive me ; I’ll have
to report you.” “Please don’t,” she pleaded.
“ Yes,” he said, “ I shall.” “No! no ! let me off
this once.” “I must do my duty,” he said, with
great authority. She came closer, flung an arm
round his neck, and exclaimed: “ Write what I
dictate, and sign it, else I’ll scream for my hus-
band.” He wrote and signed ; but, shortly, she
was removed from his district.

The time appointed for the marriage of my daughter
with the young and piously learned grandson of the hav-
ing been here chief Rabby is approaching, while we have
neither the least dowry nor the marriage expenses. This
my sorrowful position, repushing back my strongest
feelings of shyness, urges me to yield to the pressure of
the unresistible bitter need and to plead the generousity
of our benevolent religionists. 1 foster the undecievable
hope that your generousity will not admit you to refuse
your aid from a poor widow and her helpless orphans.

Apparently the Adelaide Hospital troubles
have not yet ended. Superintendent nurse
McLeod has now resigned owing to further friction,
and Miss Gordon (the Chief-Secretary s sister),
whose appointment over the heads of numerous
senior nurses was the cause of the original trouble,

A S.A. parson named
Herrington thinks that “if
suicide were generally ridi-
culed the suicidal mania
would soon be cured.”
Ridicule is the one thing a
corpse can’t stand. What a
corpse wants is to be taken
seriously, in a spirit of sub-
dued cheerfulness tempered
with respect. If when any-
body died everybody came
and guffawed at the re-
mains, death would soon
go right out of fashion !
Corpses and parsons seem
to be equally insensible to
ridicule.
Ethel Turner, in “Almost an Idyll,”
forgot the main parts of the foreground
and background—the mosquitoes. On the
Hawkesbury and its arms, to be secure from the
ravages of these little she-devils (the male
mosquito doesn’t bite), one must be provided with
an oil-cloth suit, blucher boots, rubber socks a
wide hat with curtain attached, leather gloves
and, if possible, a cwt. of the vilest tobacco and a
cannon with dust-shot, the amount to be accord-
ing to convenience and taste. At Woy Woy last
Oct., a boatman whose wife accommodated visitors
at the house, was making arrangements with a
passenger just alighted from the train for the
holidaying of his wife and children till mid-
sumnier. It was late in the afternoon, and the
mosquitoes and other insects were just starting
work. The boatman was engaged killing them or
his face legs, &c. “ I don t think, said the visitor,
“this will suit the wife. The mosquitoes are
something awful even now ; what must they be in
summer!” “ Oh,” replied the boatman, there

one of the dirtiest and most drink-soaked old

“ Much may be said,” writes ‘ Danton ’ to
The Bulletin, “in favor of a good periodical
‘ burst,’ for the nation as for the individual. The
Saturnalia, the Bacchanalia, the Carnival, the last
days of the Republican year in the French Revo-
lution, the old Christmas carousing, See., which
lasted for weeks, may have had their faults, but
they certainly tended to make the peoples con-
cerned more satisfied with themselves and one
another. The idea of a three weeks’ general and
compulsory holiday (say at end of each year), with
free railways, &c., State theatrical performances,
Olympian contests, masks and mumming, and
generaljollification isworth working out—on appro-
priate Australian lines, of course, and with proper
precautions against hardship, &c., and would tend
more than all the prayers and sermons, and thrift
movements, and general politico-economical hum-
bug, to make the people good-humored and ready
for work of any kind, and to develop in unseen
ways truly national institutions and, perhaps,
literature and arts. Wise dissipation is the
safety-valve of any decent sort of man, woman, or
nation.”

gone down a great loss of life must have resulted.
This sort of story comes along so often that the
public wants badly to know if there is any truth
in it. Do Australian steamers often go to sea
without enough boats to carry the passengers
and crew in case of disaster ? Or do they go with
just enough, reckoned on a calm-water basis, and
with no allowance for a rough sea, for a possible
smash in lowering one of the boats, or for the
chance of one or two being unget-at-able in case of
fire ?. Or does anybody really know how they go,
or do they go on any fixed rule whatever ?

e ] e cturess accordingly will come along and sniff

Mrs. Brough.
Mrs. Brough never had a player in her family,
but her parents were singers and teachers of
singers. Her father was a bass and her mother a
soprano, and Mrs. Brough was stage-struck long
ere she donned long dresses. She made her first
appearance—as Buttercup in “ Pinafore ” —with
Mr. D’Oyly Carte’s Co. That was in ’79. In the
same auspicious year Mr. Brough, at Plymouth,
joined the co., then touring the provinces, and he
—lucky man ! —formed the nucleus of the most
brilliant of all Australian comedy companies by
marrying Mrs. Brough after 18 months of court-
ship.
Mrs. Brough’s first distinct stage success was in
’Bl, when, with Charles Collette’s Comedy Co.,
she played Mrs. Blyth in “ The Colonel. ” For
the next three years or so, while Mr. Brough was
at the Gaiety Theatre, she played at the Opera
Comique with the American actress, Lotta (meet-
ing the ill-starred Dacre there); at the Globe, in
“ The Member for Slocombe and at the Avenue
in “Our Regiment.” In ’B5, the Broughs were
engaged by Williamson, Garner, and Musgrove
to come to Australia for a 12 months’ season.
* * * *
Mrs. Brough’s first Australian appearance was
as the Fairy Queen in ‘ ‘ lolanthe ”; Mr. Brough
played the Lord High Chancellor. But she always
preferred comedy to opera, for having to sing was
always a perfect torture. “I was dreadfully
nervous when singing,” she says, “and couldn’t
make headway.” Six months after the Broughs’
arrival, the late Dion Boueicault, with Dot and Miss
Boucicault, came to Australia, and, before ’B5 was
gone, Mr. and Mrs. Brough, Mr. and Miss Bouci-
cault, Emma Chambers, Jenny Watt-Tanner, Miss
Phillips, and Herbert Flemming first produced
‘ ‘ The Magistrate, ” and ran it eight weeks at
Melbourne Bijou. Then Brough and Boucicault
conceived the excellent idea of forming the famous
co. which has enabled so many bored Australians
to stay alive, and after both had gone to England
to generally arrange all business, they returned
and began their management at Melb. Opera
House 9th Oct., ’B6. “ Turned Up ” was played,
and “ Jack Sheppard ” —the latter for nine weeks,
with Fanny Robina as Jack and Royceas Blueskin.
And soon after Mrs. Brough began realising her
life’s dream —“ the dream that was born in me ”
she began playing leading parts in comedy,
“comedy, which I was always dying to play.”
* * * *
During the last nine years she has played nearly
a hundred parts. But of all, her choice is Paula
Tanqueray. “ When on the stage, I love myself
in that character ; I live it for the time being ; I
feel it tremendously, and, when all is over, I am
quite prostrated.” She likes—and looks—her part
of Niobe very much, and Kate Verity in “The
Squire.” She says, “I never liked myself as
Kate in ‘ She Stoops to Conquer,’and I’d rather
play Lady Bellaston than Sophia. lam very fond
of Beatrice in ‘ Much Ado.’ ”
* * * *
Mrs. Brough is a quick study, as indeed she
needs to be, considering how frequently plays are
changed in Australia. She says: “It is not much
trouble to learn a new part, and the more the
practice the better your study gets ; I like to be
very quiet when tasking my memory. We some-
times have to produce a play a week after we
first see our parts, and that includes getting our
dresses made, &c. I learnt Niobe in a week. I
learnt my part in ‘ The Passport ’ also in a week.
But Mr. Brough is the quickest study I ever
knew ; he will learn a part as long as mine in less
than half my time.
* * * *
“ When I have a new part given me to play, I
study it alone, and having formed my conception
of the character, present it accordingly in rehearsal.
Mr. Brough and Mr. Boucicault watch my ex-
position and assist me with hints and suggestions.
Any character I am playing never haunts me off
the stage, and I am a good sleeper. lam very
fond of horse-races, but am seldom lucky there.

“ Melbourne is one metropolis ; Sydney is an-
other. Very often a signal success in Sydney will be
only a moderate one in Melbourne, and vice versa.
For instance, ‘ Sophia ’ ran but three weeks in
Melbourne, whereas it went for six in Sydney.
Launceston (Tas.) audience is a particularly
bright one ; Wellington and Dunedin are bright
audiences, but Christchurch and Auckland are
nothing like so good.
“I just worship Bernhardt; she is divine in
that she stands alone. Last season, when we
were in Europe, Bernhardt was finer than ever.
Her Camille is the most exquisite thing I have
ever seen, and her make-up in ‘ La Tosca ’ is itself
the subtlest art. Sarah was grander than ever, too,
in a new play, ‘ Izeyl, 5 which gives glorious scope
for emotional acting. Duse’s Camille cannot be
compared with Bernhardt’s ; I sat an unmoved
critic studying Duse, admiring her, yet all the
time catching glimpses of the secret wires, and
hearing now and then the silent cues. But
Bernhardt, who can weep at will, worked me up
each night to tears and distraction, and sent me
away a perfect object.
* * * *
“ I heard Melba sing, for the first time, during
my European holiday, and think her a marvellous
vocalist but not a good actress. She stands and
sings without effort, pouring forth her pure and
beautiful notes just like a bird, yet with all this
richness not giving a hint of pathos. Patti has
sympathy in her voice ; over and over again while
listening to Patti in ‘ Traviata ’ the tears have
welled into my eyes. I heard Calve too, in Carmen;
she is a divine singer and splendid actress.
Ellen Terry, as Nance Oldfield, was wonder-
fully perfect, and Irving, despite his man-
nerisms, got right hold of me in ‘ The Bells. 5
But Irving was supreme in a great little piece of
Conan Doyle’s—‘A Straggler of 15.’ He plays
the old soldier, ‘whose arteries are pipes of lime,
whose heart is shrunken and flabby, who is dying
of ninety years,’ and who, when the final moment
comes, springs back out of the arms of death, and,
‘ standing erect with eagle head and glance of fire, 5
peals out passionately ‘ The Guards need powder,
and, by God, they shall have it ! ’ then falls back,
with a groan, and dies. ”
* * * *
Both Miss Terry and Mr. Irving (Mrs. Brough
says) think highly of Brenda Gibson.

“ Mrs. Patrick Campbell, as the Notorious Mrs.
Ebbsmith, plays with a peculiar charm, but not
much power ; nevertheless, she realises the charac-
ter so perfectly that it might have been written
for her. I think we shall play ‘ Mrs. Ebbsmith 5
before very long.”

But we sympathise with you in the abstract. Man is a

impudence to send us, as your own, a sketch written by
Mrs. Rose-Soley for The Bulletin, and herein published

be sent to gaol for false pretences. Not that we have any
time to spare for the prosecution of individual rogues

because he was for many yeais an unpaid M.P., but if
N.S.W. acknowledges it then it must pay all the other
survivors of the unpaid-M.P. epoch, or their widows, or
other legal representatives. And, as it can’t pay
them all for want of the needful millions, it can’t pay
Parkes L. Orsen: Not true to nature, as in
an asylum for the insane the utter absence of gaiety
amongst the patients is most noticeable. Deadly silence
reigns except when broken now and then by a sort of
human cackle Bun : Major-General Hutton’s recent
disparaging remarks re Australian saddlery were doubt-
less inspired by an inspection of a howdah intended to be
an improved saddle and made under the supervision of the
full official strength of the local War Department. The

structed to suit it Biler : You spin it all out so

Sydney,

My Dzab Moorabinda—
Gov. Hampden in a black bowler hat, a festive
And becoming necktie of pompadour black, scarlet
and green, and race-glasses (the same, I wonder,
that Lady H. strapped on him when she “shook
him up,” as set forth in that memorable English
interview ?) on a tan-colored strap, was certainly
the best-groomed man on the first day of the Bong
Bong picnic races. His Ex. was accompanied by
the three vice-regal girls, double-bankea by some
of the A.V.R. damsels, and the dressing all round
was seasonable. Miss Brand wore a white skirt
with fawn silk blouse and scarlet poppies in a wide
hat, her two sisters wearing respectively white
with a blue chin 6 silk blouse, and pink with a
brown hat. The suite was equestrianly gotten up
in shiny boots and things, but I was glad to notiee
that British riding-breeches have moderated in
volume, for whereas once an English horseman
afoot used to resemble a fat new woman who found
it cruelly necessary to take wide, roomy pleats in
her bloomers, there is now some suggestion of leg-
of-mutton shapeliness about him, thank the gods.
The small vice-regal scion had a little baggy riding-
suit and leggings, and rode out on a smart grey
cob, but H.E. and the ladies of the party filled a
comfortable - looking, though not very stylish,
sociable—the vice-regal taste running to yellow
harness on the bay horses.
The dressing was lively on the first day when it
was cool and misty, which made it more difficult
to understand why one or two of the prettiest
society matrons on the lawn should have worn two
veils at once as if their husbands were Turks. A
very few women rode out. The second day did
not show such a good attendance, as the sex was
not there in such an awe-inspiring majority ; and
on both days a large gap was made in the attend-
ance through the two families who run that parti-
cular part of the country being more or less in
mourning and, therefore, socially hors-de-combat
for the present. The Governor turned up in
yellow riding-boots and a poultice round his grey
felt hat. By the way, I hear that his Ex. ’s hats
rather get on the nerves of some of his rural sub-
ject s ; several of whom cannot forgive the Gov. for
making his maiden appearance at Moss Vale in a
straw “ boater ” ; but I think if Lord Hampden
only succeeds in sweeping away the idiotic tall
silk hat and the equally absurd black coat from
the face of this sun-stricken land in summer he
will have done a noble work. The V.R. party
was very <Mgag6 on the second day. The weather
was flaming hot, so, instead of sitting under a
zinc-covered pavilion and gently baking like
bricks, they sat, Governor and all, on the ground
or on camp-stools in the shade of the fence, and so
kept their powder dry. Next year I expect every-
body will be on camp-stools or primitively camped
on the grass.
The day was so warm that most people aimed
at coolness in their dressing, and because of the
sun the double-veiled trick grew to formidable
proportions. I can’t say I like the new white
chiffon veils with black spots ; they make a girl
with a round face look too much like a raw cur-
rant dumpling. The most ultra-fashionable person
present was a society matron with her hair waved
over her ears k la Parisienne, and a white-and-gold
rig-out. Gov. Hampden must have admired a
tall, fair youth who wore a white mushroom hat
draped with white muslin ; though a Sydney legal
sprig topped off with a limp white hat like the
parchment top to a bottle of home-made jam was
still more original.
Society youth in the rural districts has amusing
ways of dressing itself. There was a local lawyer
present, with a black kummerbund feelingly
worked in crewels, as if he had hung a drawing-
room bell-rope round his waist; another had a
lump of horse’s tail set in a handle, and hanging
like a philibeg, and with it he brushed away the
flies—an Indian fashion set years ago on Melb.
Block by the late Captain Standish. Premier
Reid’s dignity wouldn’t permit of his coming
forth comfortably dressed, so he was the only
man on the racecourse m a tall hat and an
umbrella. A committee-man of sunburnt aspect
mitigated his eomplexion with a scarlet necktie,
but about the most variegated figure was a Guv-
mentouse youth in white flannel pants, yellow vest,
pink shirt, and gaudy hatband, who carried an
emerald-green silk umbrella.
Miss Brand handed over the prizes at the end
of the meeting, the lion’s share going to Messrs.
Knox and Stephens, who, I hear, presented their
trainer—the lengthy Tom Payten—with the hand-
somely-fitted dressing-case, first prize in the
Bachelor’s Bag Stakes. The prizes made a regu-
lar shop-front of the back of the stand. I thought
it rather a reflection on the nails of the competitors
that the first prize for the Consolation Stakes
should have been a manicure set. The ladies’
bracelet was of gold, set with diamonds and pearls
in a graceful pattern; and the Ladies’ Mile
trophy, a gold safety-pin watch on an enamel
bow. But all the women seemed to hanker most
after a set of silver-mounted combs and brushes.
The Bong Bong race-ball, held in the new hall,
Moss Yale, on Friday evening, ran until 3 a.m.,
though the vice-regal folks left much earlier—soon
after supper. It is a good thing that the invari-
able V.R. trick of going home on top of the re-
freshments doesn’t catch on to society, or else hosts
would be obliged to set up the food at 1 a.m. in
order to keep the floor full. His Ex. (I think
Lord Hampden talks like actor Titheradge, whom
he much resembles) arrived late and accompanied
by his daughters and all the suite (Lady Hampden
was not present), the eldest Miss Brand wearing
one of the prettiest dresses on the floor—cream
brocade with violet silk sleeves and draperies of
old lace. Miss Kitty Darley wore blue satin with
a white fichu, and her sister white, of course—a
debutante dies hard nowadays. The ball was
rigged up with ferns and flags and easy chairs, the
floor was smooth, and the band kept excellent
time. A tea-and-coffee buffet was in one corner
all the evening, and an excellent supper was set
on the stage. The committee left nothing undone
to ensure a great success.
The dressing was very bright, especially for
January. But everybody wasn’t a pretty picture,
of course. A tall, thin maiden, like an under-
study for a telegraph-pole, most unwisely accen-
tuated her length and slimness by wearing a
clinging black velvet gown in which she' looked
like a note of interrogation long-drawn-out; and
a damsel in yellow and violets had evidently seen
Madge Rossejl in “A Gaiety Girl.” The men
were in a dancing mood and brought two shirt-
collars in consequence—the other one in their
pockets—so, although the evening was warm, they
kept lovely to the end. The heaviest swell on the
floor and the biggest dandy of the whole tribe was,
oddly enough, a youth who adorns Parliament on
the Labor ticket.
“ The Work Girl,” at Sydney Royal, on Satur-
day) proved to be a very breezy kind of drama
indeed, for you must admit the spectacle of a
group of larrikinesses tearing the garments off a
fat Hebrew and ending by triumphantly waving
his trousers at the audience while he escapes en-
veloped in a table-cloth, is rather an unusual stage
effect. It went to shrieks of applause on the first
night, so probably the spectacle fills a long-felt
want. There is more scope for undressing than
dressing in “The Work Girl.” Harrie Ireland
wore a Trilby collar over the dull-grey gown of the
heroine who has been betrayed and apparently
wants everybody to know it; and Miss Phillips,
as a new woman, was the only smart dresser in the
piece; though even she was handicapped by the neces-
sity of dressing vulgarly. Florrie Forde was excel-
lently got up as a coster “ donah,” her tartan frock,
wildly-feathered hat, and well-oiled bang being to
the manner born, and she was well-supported by Mr.
Westmacott, as a coster, with a good song to his
score. Why Westmacott hasn’t another song on
his list, considering how deftly he manages a
comic ditty, is a mystery, seeing that he is his own
manager.
Signor “ Katherine ” Lardelli sends me three of
his characteristic compositions from London. A
toccata in F, dedicated to Henri Kowalski, is a
very flowing melody not difficult to play and hav-
ing a classical savor; a brigandon, dedicated to
Miss Lottie Hyam, is a bright, clever allegro
marcato which that gifted pianiste will make much
of; and then there is a hunting-song for piano, in
which the spirit of the hunt is so evident that you
feel that the dogs and horns are only a page ahead
of you. It is very easy to play, besides.
The great Zimmerman and his wife were hugely
gaped at travelling over from Melbourne per ex-
press the other day—Mrs. Zim. more than her
flying hubby, who looks a lanky, slack-baked kind
of youth, generally hiding behind a big cigar.
Mrs. “Zimmy,” however, was an eye-arrester, for
Australia isn’t educated up to women travelling in
garden-party costume, and Mrs. Zim., though her
groundwork was black, had so many dressy stripes
and tags and odds and ends, culminating in a
wildly-feathery hat on three hairs, and light
gloves, that women who travelled with her
couldn’t take her all in even during 600 miles.
Evidently a dashing American on her travels
carries more frou-frou to the square yard than does
her Australian prototype, who would defer a
journey any day if her shirt-front wasn’t stiff. The
Zims. left per Monowai last Monday, and I did
hear a flying rumor that Mrs. Zim. took to the
deep in cream silk and diamonds.
“The Passport,” at Sydney Lyceum is one of
the liveliest farces B. and B. ever staged—it is one
long, well-dressed laugh in three acts. Mrs.
Brough, as the lady who makes all the trouble,
wore, in the first act, a Prussian-blue travelling
coat with deep collars of brown fur, perky little
toque en suite. Miss Watt-Tanner (who is rather
heavy on the grease-paint just now, and who
shouldn’t say “ prubbably ” for “probably ”) made
an imposing figure in furry wraps which must be
rather trying wear at this season of the year; but,
as the first act moves in Russia, furs are, of course,
in the business, for you never by any chance meet
with a summery Russian on the stage.
Brough has a fur-lined overcoat—and, by the 'y,
what an expression of smug English respectability
Mr. Brough’s trousers present when he is play-
ing a smug, respectable Englishman . Trousers
really are expressive things, and trie way Mr. • ■
breeches bag at the knees and corkscrew over
boots in certain roles greatly helps to mterpre
character. I didn’t like Cecil Ward s ugly fur c P
—it looked as if he were wearing a lady s ol
fashioned sealskin bag.
The second and third acts were dressed alike,
but Mrs. Brough wore such a handsome gown that
nobody minded that. It was a fete dress of carna-
tion-pink silk with a round, white spot, and made
with a full plain skirt and large pink puff-sleeves
to the elbow on a black band. r Llie bodice had no
high collar, but a deep collar-cwm-cape of black lace
and net fell over the back and shoulders, the front
of the bodice having a pleated interval of white
silk set in bands of black and white embroidery.
Long cream Suede gloves and a rakish hat en suite
completed a very handsome turn-out, which also
had two glittering black jet buttons on the back
of the bodice. Miss Watt-Tanner loomed large in
blue. Hilda Spong hardly looked fresh enough
for a going-away bride in a sage-green skirt and a
grey velvet blouse with silver Buttons and grey
fur on the deep color, and her hat looked a trifle
scrunched. Fashionably so, I suppose, for the
latest fashion in hats is said to be something that
might have been kicked by a horse. Up-to-date
girls, when they’re buying top-knots, ask for a
little hat that looks as if it had been out all night
and got jammed in a door. Miss Mabel Hardy
had the flattest gown of all —white silk with a
Romish-altar-looking collar of purple velvet and
fold ; a violet-strewn toque and a palm-leaf fan.
)ot Boucicault, as Greenwood, reminded ine
of Signor Lardelli, and Dorrington looked like an
understudy to Secretary Gathorne Hardy.
Writes my Melb. correspondent: —
“ Florence Young never looked better than as a
boy in the panto, at Melb. Princess’s. Like one of
Diokens’s heroines, she is “a fine figure of a
woman,” and the less clothes worn the better by
an actress whose stock-in-trade consists of her
shapeliness and agreeable singing-voice. For the
same reason, Prince Eucalyptus, in stockman’s
fet-up — i.e. , short grey pants, red silk shirt, felt
at, &c. —is less impressive than in later scenes.
In the gorgeous, if scant, attire of a stage prince,
Miss Young looks splendidly “fine and large,”
and hides no charm worth mentioning. Also, she
frisks with more freedom than when hampered
by skirts, though, as usual, the effect of her facial
make-up is marred by an overdone feverish-flush
round the eyes.
“ Of all the delightful ‘ Djin-Djin ’ pictures, the
frozen forest with its dancing snow-elves wins
most applause this hot weather. Only two colors
appear in the misty raiment of the ballerinas—
pure white and the greeny-blue of moonbeams
shining on ice. The wintry scene gives place to
sunny glades, peopled by chrysanthemum sprites,
thanks to the magic of Fairy Leonore Orelli,
whose wings, by the way, produce so round-
shouldered an effect as to make observers more
than ever unsympathetic with the mental attitude
expressed in the hymn, ‘ I want to be an angel ’!
The flower-fays are quite dazzling after their
poetic predecessors, and the audience speedily
relapses into perspiration in the noon-tide glare of
their pinky heliotropes, glowing apricots and
greens, garlanded with red.
“The golden ballet, with everything (wigs
included) the color of new sovereigns, auriferous
manna dropping from heaven, and a curtain all
gilt chains and electric-lights descending in the
midst, sets everyone yearning for Coolgardie. In-
deed, the tout ensemble is almost too splendid, and
makes one think of the mansion, owned by golden-
kgged Miss Kilmansegg, which was ‘all gold,
fine gold, both yellow and red, beaten and molten,
polished and dead ! ’
“Flora Graupner, as Princess Iris, is unaffected
as ever, though voice and color seem to have
suffered during her retirement. Japanese dress,
too, is slightly trying, and a wearer needs to
possess striking contour or else sparkling vivacity
to counteract the dowdiness of shapeless draperies.
Ihe scene where the small Princess, swathed in
green tartan, or something that looks like it, sits
enthroned m a jinriksha, isn’t a bit Japanese,
somehow; suggesting rather her Britannic Majesty
m her donkey-shay at Nice, clad in the traditional
plaid shawl and mushroom hat, to the awe and
mystification of the Italian populace. Ivy Scott
also, touring the frozen forest in Rob Roy tartan’
looks own cousin to ‘ Ellen Macjones Aberdeen ’
but, though one wouldn’t have thought so, plaids
must be popular in Chrysanthemum country or
they wouldn’t appear in ‘Djin-Djin,’ which is
nothing if not up-to-date.
“ Nothing could be more natural than Ivy
Scott s Cheekee, even her little inconsequent
caressing remarks about the enchanted monkev
sound spontaneous and unstudied.
“ Coleman as maiden aunt ‘Okiama,’ is posi-
tively appalling in ‘rationals,’ short enough to
show intervals of pasty white prop-stick between
them and his hose-tops. After all, though, he
doesn t look so very much worse than some of our
iocal cyclistes. One matron in particular, who
publicly sneers and jeers at women riding in skirts
affects ginger-colored bloomers and sits her
rY Xa l tly 1 1 i . ke a frog> . No one ca n under-
stand why she abjures petticoats—not that she
deserves the reproach of ‘ spindle-shanks,’ but an
Ht-'flflVT 1 r Uld her as ‘beef to the heels
like a Mullingar heifer.
“Eiton’s song, ‘My old friend Sam,’ causes
much laughter, just because the lamented Sam
used to live near a dam. Owing to defective
punctuation, the said dam sounds as if meant for
a swear word, hence the excitement. A Banana-
land bishop once made the same mistake, it was
in the country, and a few local identities had been
summoned to the parsonage to commune and take
tea with the shepherd-m-chief. The schoolmistress
and organist combined, arriving late, publicly
excused herself on the ground that it was so hard
to find the dam plank in the dark. The poor
thing had a wretched evening, for the guest of the
occasion ostentatiously snubbed her and turned a
deaf ear to everything she said. _ Not until next
day, when he had left the district, did the sup-
posed culprit discover what th# bishop must have
thought.
“ Every trick mastered ensures more bones to
the performing dog. A Melb. girl, educated up
to high-water-mark, disliked teaching and turned
cook. She prospered in her new vocation, com-
manded increasing salaries, and soon felt em-
boldened to apply for the position of housekeeper
at the town residence of Victoria’s most impressive
private family. Luck again served her and she
got the post, chiefly owing to her familiarity with
French. One of her duties is to procure and study
all the new cookery-books published in Paris, so
as to keep her dinner orders up to date, and to her
falls the superintendence of the menu.
“The ways of the lady cyclist are now most
pronounced. The other day a party of three dis-
mounted in Swanston-st., because they did not
choose to dodge in and out among the traffic, ooolly
brought their wheels on the sidewalk, and trundled
them abreast till they were well past Princes
Bridge—all talking and laughing loudly as they
went. This in a busy time of day and a busy
street. As they took up the whole of the path,
pedestrians both ways had either to be jammed
against shop fronts, or turn into the gutters.
Men didn’t say anything, but they looked.
“The latest in coiffures is to allow a loose lock
to hang negligently down the back. Followers of
this fashion of careless elegance when in the street,
however, have to be prepared for the inevitable
gamin with his ‘ Please, Mum, your hair’s cornin’
down.’ ”

Dear Bulletin, Putting the word

News of the sudden death, at Bourke, of
Mr. George Loughnan will be received with deep
regret by a very wide circle. In his halcyon days
there was no more generously-hospitable home,
whether for the man who rode or for the man who
walked, than that of Mr. Loughnan, whose kindly
nature did not desert him in less prosperous times.
The women of Melbourne might very well
have petitioned for the reprieve of young man
Strange, who was “ duly ” hanged the other Mon-
day. Strange declared that he tomahawked his
mate for saying nasty things about the daughter
of one of their former employers. Bitter critics
would be disposed to argue that such extreme
chivalry in a young Australian was proof positive
of a diseased brain.
Wisdom of the S.M. H. (Same Mould
Herald). First leader, Jan. 21: —
Every man is the better for having a fairly complete
knowledge of his trade ; not merely because it has a cer-
tain educating influence, but because it may be of service
to him.
Wonderful ! How does the Herald find these
things out ? What a marvellous man Mister
James is ! Not a “ complete ” knowledge, it will
be observed, but only a “ fairly complete ” know-
ledge. Cautious, non-committal Herald ! And
he is the better ” not, it will be noticed, for one
reason only, but for two reasons !
Dear Bulletin,—This is the sort of thing
that the papers up here don’t report. The other
morning a leper, with his face (the lower part
eaten away) covered by a veil, was on Roma-street
railway-station. He was surrounded by a swarm
of Hies, settling on the matter that was running
through the veil and down his clothes. While
waitmg he sat, unmolested by the officials, on one
l ,6 public seats, and almost immediately after
he left some women sat on the same spot. In
another case, discovered only a couple of weeks
ago in a suburb, the leper had consulted several
doctors about his skin eruptions. They evidently
ldn t know what it was, and the man might have
been with his family yet had he not happened to
d C fu - ( his wife to fetch some money to pay
the Chinese vegetable-hawker. Immediately the
Chow saw the man he took his baskets and cleared
without his money, telling the man “Go way:
you no good; you money no good ; you leper.”
Ihe doctors seem to regard the disease as non-
contagious, but the Chinese evidently think other-
wise.-Query. Brisbane.

POLITICAL
POINTS
In all the Australian provinces, except Tas-
mania, the number of children to a marriage seems
to be steadily decreasing.
it is now said that Symon, Q.C., declines
to make the sacrifice of professional income neces-
sary to enable him to enter the S. A. Assembly.
At the S.A. general election, in April,
Premier Kingston will probably be opposed in his
pet district of West Adelaide by Alderman Wells,
of the City Council.
If, after that cablegram to Salisbury,
George Reid’s “ bauble ” does not come on Vic-
toria’s 77th birthday, then there is no “recipro-
city ” in the high Tory Ministry.
The difference between Age and Argus
boiled down —the one says it is Protectionist and
isn’t, the other that it is a Freetrader and isn’t;
the one spells “honor” and “ Lilly dale,” the
other “ honour ” and “ Lilydale.”
Melb. Argus affects to regard as a new
and brilliant idea old Jock MTntyre’s proposal of
a general manager for the Vic. railways, said
manager to be assisted by two sub-advisers, with
Parliament looming in the background.
Nat Thornley, M.L.C. (Vic.), orated last
week about the rabbit pest, and the urgent neces-
sity of Government’s doing something. What is
the matter here with Private Enterprise and all
the other funniments of the Tory box of tricks ?
Premier Turner took the unusual course
of ordering a speech in opposition to a Govern-
ment Bill to be reprinted for general circulation.
The speech was Styles on Railways, and consists
of an interesting comparison of all the Australian
systems.
The decisions of the Plenary Council of
Australasia came at a rather critical time in
Bananaland. On the Education Question no
genuine Democrat can tamper or parley for a
moment. The Fat Men of the North, however,
will tamper with anything. The only grain of
compensation lies in the fact that the Roman
fanatic is, to a certain extent, balanced by the
Orange fanatic, and vice-versa.
Sydney Li-
censing Guar-
dian points out,
in a loud ink-
shriek, that the
oollapse of the
Mildura settle-
ment totally re-
futes the Cold-
tea theory that
P r oh i b it ion
must produce
prosperity.
“The hard-
drinking old col-
onists,’' it adds,
“ never knew
want,” while the
present moder-
ate - drinking
generation is
very hard-up in-
deed. But then,
did the old colo-
nists prosper be-
cause they drank
hard, or did they
drink hard be-
cause they were
prosperous?
Also, how would
the same argu-
ment look if it
was pointed out
that this country
was at its best
in the days when
there were plen-
ty of bushran-
gers, and the
digger had often
to carry his
water - supply
four miles m a
tin can ! Would
that prove that
the way to re-
store prosperity
would be to start
bushranging
again, and for
every man to
hump his own
water-supply from the creek ? ,
One of the charming objections to the
minimum wage for factories is that the employes
S be pai/less under it. °J».f S
sie-ht of Fat Man getting red in the lace ana
purple in the pocket about a drop m wages is too
touching in a time when only com can ring and
no one cares for rhymes.
The Tasmanian remarks: “The N.S.W.
bootmaker will now be able to got ail his rnatenal
at first cost, and it will be strange if he do^nt
maintain control of his own market.
Still, as one Sydney bootseller alone "
week of Freetrade, landed A12,00U worrn ox
foreign boots, the assumption is that the local
Inakfr isn’t going to maintain control of his own
market, or anything like it.
Under the Maoriland “Animals Protec-
tion Act Amendment Act,” any person introduc-
ing any insect into the province, without the con-
sent, in writing, of the Minister for Agriculture,
may be fined from .£5 upwards. An unsavory
passenger found coming ashore with the Norfolk
Howard about him might have a bad time under
this law.
The Vic. Chamber of Manufactures objects
to a legalised Eight-hour Day. The kind old
thing says it is a mistake for the State to teach
the people to be lazy. The limitation to 10 hours’
work in one day for boys and women should be
altered to 11 hours, and there should be no fee for
suspending the limitation.
The Vic. Bootmakers’ Ass. thinks it is a
great mistake to regulate child-labor in factories.
The Assembly Bill gives the Factory Board power
to determine the number and wages of improvers
and apprentices—and this is reckoned a grievous
sin. The Vic. bootmakers labor under the im-
pression that the Vic. tariff on boots was estab-
lished to assist employers in coercing labor.
The Melbourne Single-tax organ, the
Beacon, draws attention proudly to the fact that
N.S. Wales “manufactures more goods locally”
than Victoria, as brilliant evidence in favor of
Foreign-trade. Coghlan’s latest statistics assert
that Victorian manufactured goods amount to
£22,000,000 a year, and N.S.W.’s to £16,000,000
only, so presumably the Beacon’s statistics are
manufactured on the premises, as usual.
The Factories Amendment Bill, passed by
Vic. Assembly, provides imprisonment for a third
breach of the Act. This is characterised as
“brutal” by a protected bootmaker giving evi-
dence to a Council Committee. Insanitation,
overwork and underpayment are the offences to
which imprisonment is attached, and doubtless
such trivial details in the blessed Gospel of Com-
petition really merit reward and not punishment.
Mr. Blake, Q.C., the Irish member, hasbeen
denied the use of Melb. Town Hall for the purpose
of a lecture on Home Rule, because the promulga-
tion of his views “creates dissension,” but the
local L.O.L. easily secured the use of the hall for
“ a demonstration.” The L.O.L. doesn’t create
dissension. Dissension may be defined as the
trouble that catches the loyal Fatman under the
chest.
Quite on the cards that Tasmania will get
nearer to One-man-one-vote than was thought
possible, by an unexpected side-wind. This, of
course, barring accidents which consist (as
usual) of Upper House. The Federal Enabling
Bill now going through Parliament provides that
“no person mall vote more than once ” for the
Convention delegates. It does not mean that
every man will have a vote, but it knocks plural
voting endways.
Premier Turner’s clumsy Railway Trust
scheme fell through suddenly. Instead of five
trustees who know nothing about railway business
bossing a cheap manager who can’t afford to
“AUSTRALIA FOB THE AUSTRALIANS
WEARY WAG: “ Hello, mate ; what are you doing in that rig-out? I hardly
knew you."

know much about it at the salary, there is to be
one commissioner at a salary large enough to buy
about the best man on earth, and with almost
absolute power. Consequently, David Syme can t
possibly be boss-trustee after all, and Speight s
friends are going to make a big effort to secure
his appointment as the highly-paid manager. But
Victoria has had a lot too much of Speight.
When blundering old John M‘lntyre was
Vic. Minister for Lands, he struck a fatal idea in
the way of retrenchment, and sacked the whole oO
rabbit inspectors at one fell swoop. Before his
time, through rigidly keeping the farmers and
graziers up to the mark in the matter of rabbit-
destruction, the plague had been so much
diminished that people fancied it was almost got
under. Now, it is nearly as bad as ever, and the
struggle with the long, sad, interminable bunny is
going to be started again from the beginning, and
in the agricultural districts people throw mud at
the very name of MTntyre, K.C.M.G.
A meeting was called at Coolgardie last
week to fix up a resolution stating that that corner
of the Red Dust Land would support the British
Government and see it through. Two thousand
uninterested dry-blowers turned up but flatly re-
fused to regard the business seriously, and after
two hours of cat-calling and derision the matter
fell through. Salisbury, therefore, didn’t get a
cable stating that the 45-Mile would stand by the
empire to the last, and that the 90-Mile and the
15-Mile and the half-way soak would back it up.

Premier Kingston (S.A.) thinks Ballarat
about the best site for the capital of Federated
Australia.
Those who read of Judas Chamberlain’s
repudiation of the South African Chartered Co.
probably forget that, a few weeks ago, he favored
such another brigand association exploiting the
Northern Territory of Australia.
War, pestilence, shipwreck, miraculous
deliverance from either, any event big enough to
stir the sentiment of a people, has always been
productive of sweet songs and noble poems. Note
the alleged poems so far written on Australian
Federation, and judge the size of the sentiment
behind the movement.
Circumstances and unscrupulous ambition
are forcing Chamberlain farther and farther from
his early convictions. Not only has he, the first of
English Home Rulers, turned Unionist, but now
he is the leader of the “ spirited ” policy which he
was foremost in denouncing when Beaconsfaeld
was boss Jingo. What democracy has lost by the
change can be estimated only by those who
lived in Brummagem when “Joe’ was a mere
municipal politician.
Premier Kingston is anxious to have the
S A. Federal delegates elected at the same time
as the next Parliament, so as to ensure a heavy
vote and a consequent Democratic success. A
special election, with the whole province voting as
one constituency, as provided by the Act, would
be too expensive for all but the Bakers and the
Downers to run effectively. The S.A. representa-
tives are each to receive £2 2s. daily, for their ser-
vices at the Convention.
There will be a big woman-vote at the
approaching S.A. elections. Already there has
been much organised canvassing, and it looks as
if the fight will be mainly on Tory and Demo-
cratic lines ; but the doubtful element is the
W.C.T.U. section. Whether the cold-tea women
wiil support the Ass candidate, who is a teeto-
taller but has a morganatic wife, or reject him and
vote for the Democratic candidate with one wife
and a 40-horse-power thirst, is a problem yet
unsolved.
The Sydney stipendiaries sitting in con-
clave under the auspices of a Freetrade Govern-
ment have decided to grant hawkers’ licences to
Chinese, Indians, Syrians, and other colored trash
without reference to racial distinction wher® no
valid objection is raised by the police. lhere is
plenty of money behind the Indian-Assyrian hawk-
ing trade. After Magistrate Smitherss recent
refusal to license a lot of Syrians, a very stout
Asiatic harangued a gathering of his indignant
fellow-countrymen in sound English from the
front step of Redfem Police-court, proclaiming
that he had over £BOOO invested in the hawker
and would be ruined if his travellers
were refused legal permits.
Westralian Premier Forrest has put Ms
foot down on the wrangling of the Government
departments which used to provide the Perth
papers with much spicy copy. There is also to be
no more abuse of the “system.” It was the
custom of the reporters, especially when the
Premier was away, to devote one day to each
department, which seized with alacrity the oppor-
tunity of allotting the blame for all the adminis-
trative muddling in W.A. to the other depart-
ments, placing what was left over on the
“ system,” the universal scapegoat. Ihe enforced
harmony is resented all round.
Several persons from Adelaide and Sydney,
whom no one has ever heard of, were in Melb.,
the other day, on holiday excursion tickets ; they
were picked up by several local people whom no
one ever wants to hear of, and the result was the
Australasian National League. What these un-
necessary nonentities want is Law and Order,
Restoration of Confidence, and Opposition to
dangerous Socialistic Legislation. They likewise
want advt. for their own miserable selves on the
cheap Tory tack, if possible—but, anyway, advt.
Would it be
a gross interfer-
ence with vested
rights to have it
declared that a
certain strip on
the margin of
all rivers should
be for ever
public property?
This is, to a cer-
tain extent, the
case with all
lands on the
borders of rivers
alienated after a
certain date in
Victoria. But
nearly all the
river-land about
Melbourne is
fenced to the
water’s - edge,
with the result
that the natural
park of the
people is forbid-
den to them—
“trespassers will
be prosecuted ”
. (which, by the
way, is an illegal
form of notice,
and not as effec-
tual as the land-
owners think)
being plentifully
displayed about
the banks. The
same would hold
of arms of the
sea. Careful as
it was of the
rights of private
owners, Roman
law made river-
margins practi-
cally public pro-
perty. The few
M’sP. who think
it worth their
while to look
after the rights
of the people might easily agitate, anyhow, for
this small boon to the tired masses of the cities.
Just now there is trouble in S.A. Cabinet
because Premier Kingston declined to make a
recent insolvent a J.P. at the request of one col-
league, and because he declined to rectify an
indiscretion by which the wrong man was gazetted
a J.P. in another colleague’s district.
The only two S.A. politicians who have
definitely announced their candidature for election
to the Federal Convention are President Baker,
of the Legislative Council, and J. V. O’Loghlin,
M.L.C., “ who will carry the R.C. vote” —alas
that there should be a R.C. vote in Federation !
The members of the Ministry who will stand are
Premier Kingston, Treas. Holder, Chief-Sec.
Gordon, and Education Minister Cockbum.
Opposition-leader Downer is a doubtful starter,
and just now he is so much broken-down by the
serious illness of his wife that he can think of
nothing else.
An attempt is being made to heal the
breach between the M‘Carthy and Redmond
sections of the Sydney Irish on the ground of a
common alliance against Tim Healy. Tim is sup-
ported by a large minority of his countrymen —his
expulsion was carried by 47 votes against 40 —and
next general election may give him a majority.
As a fighting politician he is worth a hundred like
Dillon and M‘Carthy. He knows Ireland, and,
above all, his chief lieutenant, Arthur O’Connor,
is one of the ablest and least demonstrative Irish-
men sent to the Commons. Speaker Brand, Gov.
Hampden’s father, pronounced O’Connor to be the
ablest Parliamentarian of the ’Bl session, while
his fiscal knowledge even then marked him out as
the first Treasurer of a Home Rule Parliament.
The smash of the N.S.W. Civil Service
Superannuation Fund can’t be very long delayed.
The new Act permits all civil servants to stop
contributing to the fund, and as a vast proportion
of the younger ones whose pensions are very re-
mote have stopped, and a lot more will do so, the
income of the fund will probably drop one-half.
Those who stop paying are to receive back all
their contributions with three per cent, interest
when they leave the service, therefore a lot of
what money there is must be set aside to meet
their claims. Meanwhile the pensioners go on as
usual, and all the old civil servants who will
become pensioners in a few years stick to the fund,
so though the income goes down enormously, the
outgo will remain quite, or very nearly, as large
for a good many years yet. Therefore, the million
or two needed to prevent the fund going bankrupt
must be found before very long, else the pensions
will have to stop and the superannuated under-
secretaries will begin to be captured by the police
at night in the Domain and charged with sleeping
out under copies of the S.M. Herald.

of cheese there, and enough beer to build a rampart
round the local barracks.
Mrs. Zander, a remarkable woman, died
the other day in Melb. About 30 years ago, the
death of her husband, a leading Melb. merchant,
plunged the family in distress. Mrs. Z. and her
two daughters pluckily went to the warehouse,
without any knowledge of the business, took up
all its skeins, and carried it forward even more
successfully than Zander had done.
It is fashionable amongst colonial historians
to avoid reference to Johnny Fawkner’s father
when writing up the fathers of Victoria. And
yet it is a sufficiently known fact that long before
the Indented Heads or the Yarra knew Johnny,
his pa took a trip to Van Diemen’s Land, and,
like many others, was so impressed with the
climate and scenery of the island that he decided
to stay there.
Tasmania’s new knight, P. O. Fysh, was
originally ‘‘ in the softgoods ” in the warehouse of
the Melbourne Stevensons. He it was who on
first entering office as a Minister years ago re-
ceived a communication from the then Secretary
of State for the Colonies signed “ Your most
obedient humble servant, Carnarvon,” which was
duly acknowledged by “Your most obedient
humble servant, Fysh.” Fact.
Justice Hodges (Vic.) has absolutely no
sense of humor. Once, when at the Bar, he made
to a brother barrister a slight admission to this
effect, but he added, “ I intend to take up the
subject during next vacation.” He had mapped
out for himself a course of “funny anecdotes,”
no doubt. Before the vacation arrived Hodges
was appointed to the Bench, and apparently his
court has been sitting ever since.
Tasmanian Premier Braddon is the unfor-
tunate victim of over-generosity on the part of
friends and acquaintances —and even of strangers
—for not so long ago some disconsolate widow sent
him a pair of infants, with the request that, as she
had no further use for them, and her late husband
was a Tasmanian, he (the unfortunate Premier)
would be good enough to “ provide for them.
The position was an awkward one, for Braddon
couldn’t give them away—neither had he any
immediate use for them, nor might he drown
them—and the all too generous donor had left no
address to which they might be returned.
Braddon’s sorrows are by no means over yet, for a
friend, or enemy, has just sent him a present of
three young Tasmanian tigers. For these also
the wily Premier has no immediate use.
A brother of Andrew
Lang, the English critic, died
in the prime of life at Castle-
hill, Canterbury (M.L.). Years
ago, A. C. Lang was the
Napier resident partner of
Murray, Roberts and Co., when
that firm was at its zenith.
Severing his connection there-
with, Mr. Lang bought por-
tion of the well-known El-
derslie estate, in the South
Island, where he soon made
a name as a breeder of
prize sheep and a successful
farmer.
Miss Florence Wilton, the
festive lady imported for Melb.
Royal pantomime, is one of the
most pleasing burlesque artists
The Bulletin can talk about
just now. Her energy and pluck
are severely tested at the Royal,
where there is nobody to assist
her in making a pace. Miss
Wilton needs a tandem—we
had almost slipped into the error
of writing triplet—to take her
along, as cyclists would say.
No show could travel too fast
for this enthusiastic worker,
who has fairly earned the right
to look like her onetime over-
study, Nellie Earren. Miss
Wilton is among the few legiti-
mate principal boys. Some
ladies are bom to wear tights,
some achieve those soothing
garments, whilst others merely
ave tights thrust upon them
for the sake of their legs. The
subject of this notice was born
to wear the articles in question.
She acts in obedience to the
grandest law of the theatrical
nature, likewise by the blessing
of Providence, we believe. Miss
Wilton certainly possesses the
Earren capacity for being “a
jolly little chap all round,” and
The Bulletin hopes that her
projected appearance in Sydney
will duly happen.
Interesting to John Smith : Down South
the other day, a constable sent to serve a sum-
mons on “ John Smith, Ho. 9 —— street, Colhng-
wood,” found the address given was occupied by a
church, and so reported. The paper came back
with a minute from his irate superior offioer:
“ This is the 17th man this month who has given
his name as John Smith and could not be
Arrest the next man who says- he is John Smith.’
Mr. Blake, M.P., Q.C., who acted as
arbitrator in the M.L. Midland Railway affair,
and who has come to Australia to speak on Irish
Home Rule, is in appearance a typical advocate
of the Ireland, Martin, and Molesworth type—a
man with a massive head and a face in which are
combined the firmness and severity of the monk
and the humor of the comedian. Mr. Blake wears
on his forehead the big curl which you so often
see on the head of the virile man who remains
boyish until old age.
v Justice Dodds, of Tasmania, put up some-
thing of a Parliamentary record, having attained
office as a Minister without once speaking m the
House. His solitary pre-Ministeml vote—a silent
one —settled the fate of the Giblin Government in
78, and, being the only available lawyer, he was
made Attorney-General in the Crowther Ministry.
Dodds held continuous office, either as Treasurer
or Attorney-General from 78 till lean
years. The fat years of a Puisne Judgeship have
happened along regularly ever since.
Edward John Eyre, who landed in Sydney
in 1833 and who published “ Discoveries in Central
Australia” more than 50 years ago, still lives
in England. In 1840 Eyre started on foot from
Adelaide for King George’s Sound, which he
reached on 7th July, 1841, and he was probably
the first white man to pass over the present site or
the Coolgardie diggings. In ’46 Eyre was ap-
pointed Lieut.-Governor of Maori land under Hori
Grey, with whom he was closely associated m
South Australia. He will be 81 tins year.
One of the oldest Victorian solicitors, G.
J. Pitman, died at Hawthorn (Melb.) last .week,
aged 93. Thirty years ago, when practising a
Bendigo, he “retired,” and went to live m rviei-
bourne. He appeared in court only once atter-
wards, at the age of 80, to assist in the defence ol
a relative. He was admitted an attorney in -Itup-
land in 1826, and in Victoria m 02. Robert
Wallen, merchant and journalist, who died m
Maoriland a year or two ago, and the late superin-
tendent Winch, of the Vic. police, married
daughters of Mr. Pitman.
Melbourne Argus has scored freely over
the Transvaal affair with its well-informed notes
on the cables, by “Uitlander.” Ihe writer is
little F. J. Samson, a Hebrew character of a kind
that went out of fashion about the time he was
born. Samson affects the obsolete pane of glass
in one eye, and a smallish bell-topper on an ex-
ceptionally large round head. He is only lately
from Johannesburg, where he put m about six
years of journalistic life, and he is suspected ot
bunging up one optic with a toy window m order
that he may concentrate the other on the main
chance.
Mr. Frank Gardiner, husband of the
popular Miss Carrie Swain, and well-known in
Sydney as a bold mining-speculator, is paragraphed
in London as having, with Wolf Joel (Barney
Barnato’s kinsman and factotum), won some
<£15,000 or <£16,000 at Monte Carlo in half-an-hour
recently. Mr. Gardiner, who in his career has
endured many ups and downs with an unmoved
countenance, is said to have originally been a clog-
dancer. He is a man with the impassive face oi
one of Deadwoo 1 Dick’s Red Indians, and was
obviously intended by Nature to play poker for
whole continents.
Mrs. Parnell, mother of the dead Irish
leader, is, it is cabled, found to be insane. Other
members of the family have displayed
Beyond a doubt, her illustrious son was “ looney
for years before his death. “ The unknown is
worshipped.” When forced to come into the
open, the calm, cool leader was found to be the
hottest, rashest and most foolish of men—or else
he deliberately assumed that r6le as suited to an
occasion when it was necessary to take the enemy
by storm or not at all. Could Lecky now add
another chapter to his “Irish Leaders,” how would
he sum up Parnell ?
Mrs. Fysh, the Treasuress of Tasmania, is
renowned for her soups, which are always made

by her own hand, and are worthy of Soyer, of im-
mortal fame. Mrs. Fysh likes her little joke, and
somewhat staggered Admiral Bowden Smith by a
remark made regarding the soup at one of her
husband’s official dinners. “Your soups are
simply divine creations,” said the Admiral to the
lady, adding—“ You must have a very good
cook.” “So I have,” was the lady’s reply ; “ but
I caught Phil kissing her in the kitchen just now. ”
Hereupon the consternated Admiral nearly fell off
his seat. “Oh,” said Mrs. Fysh, “you needn’t
look so shocked. I was the cook.”
Mrs. Keith Stewart, daughter of Gov.
Fitzroy (the lady who turned the first sod of the
first Australian railway at Redfern, 3rd July,
1850), lately died in England. The railway which
was intended to “ connect Parramatta with
Sydney ” was the work of a private co. of which
the late Charles Cowper was secretary. The ven-
ture was a failure and was taken over by Govern-
ment. The spade and barrow used on the occasion
were presented by Mrs. Stewart to Mr. Cowper
and recently by his son, Sheriff Cowper, to the
N.S.W. Railway AgT

Another J; Be Coalition Ministry,

Nimmo listened with a gloomy gravity, and n,
with sorrow in his voice, remarked to the Fre

same time he might be allowed to the
calumny often uttered that he had been sent
out ” from Scotland for killing a policeman. Sub-
sequently, at a bogus Cabinet meeting, this matter
of the policeman put the other affair m the shade.
The truth of it was that Nimmo had actually
saved the life of a constable, and he knew that
Service was aware of this. “Noo, sit, _ne said,
addressing the Premier, who presided, 1 will ask
ye one question an’ abide by your answer, 1
nae save the life o’ the coonstable in Ayr . 1

ye were mixed up in an affair involving a police-

of “ submitting his reesegnation.”
Dear Bulletin, —Why, oh ! why afflict the
world with paragraphs re the authoress of “ One
Woman’s Folly”—or is it “One Woman’s Wis-
dom”? Even the giant Murphy, grown by
O’Hooligan O’Hara, of Paddybilly, had more
points of interest than this exceedingly small
literary potato. Miss Agnes Murphy is now
“ known,” and owes her fame largely to the insati-
able anxiety of 500 Melb. journalists to get six-
penny paragraphs into the papers. Any other
nonentity might be as easily set up for bom-
bardment. In fact, fame or reputation (same
thing) in man or woman nowadays appears
to be due mainly to the industry of the small
paragraphers who stand prepared to confer glory
indiscriminately for ninepence or so, by the
editor’s leave. Surely Miss Murphy’s work is not
good enough to deserve this wholesale and persis-
tent condemnation? —Yours, C.M.G.
Harry Musgrove’s appointment to the
managership of next Australian Eleven was warmly
advocated by The Bulletin, and should please
everybody—save, perhaps, the 30 odd rival candi-
dates who lost the race for the billet. Even these
must admit that a really good man got home—or,
rather, will go ’Ome in March. The original of
the photo, published herewith has the advantage
of not being local to any province. He is a citizen
of the Southern Hemisphere. Among many all-
round theatrical experiences, extending over the
past 10 years or more, Harry Musgrove’s charge
of the “ Lonnen ” Gaiety Co. tour has been well
instanced as proof of his business and social
ability. A manager who conducts an army of
stage players through a successful six months’ cam-
paign will find as little difficulty as possible
in preserving peace and goodwill among 13 healthy
cricket artists, also on tour. That the manager’s
family name will assist him in his business rela-
tions with many Britishers goes without saying.
All visiting English elevens have carried ’Ome
pleasant recollections and honorable mention of
Williamson and Musgrove, and their chief officer,
Harry. Indeed, The Bulletin fears that the
Firm is somewhat of a silken bond binding us to
the “ mother country. ” Thirteen has often proved
an unlucky member of cricketers to send abroad.
The team that travels with Harry Musgrove will
include 14 players, available for active service.
If the captain calls upon the manager to take part
in a game, it will not be his maiden effort against
the best English bowling. Musgrove bats with
the graceful science that satisfies the stalls, and
the vigor which endears a performer to the gods.
He’ll be .there if the Eleven wants him. The
Bulletin hopes, however, that the manager’s
lubricating influence will make the Eleven work
so well that he will remain a reserve force all the
time, and be chiefly occupied in smiling at an
unbroken succession of Australian victories and
an unprecedented flow of gate-money to the
treasury.

The usual Half-yearly Dividend and Bonus of
£750 was paid to Shareholders in July ; Bonuses
amounting to £1536 3s. Id. were paid to Policy-
holders ; an Investment was written down £265
17s. 9d.; Office Furniture account was reduced
£4O; and Bad Debts written off were £54 14s. 3d.,
leaving a balance of £4228 6s. 7d. for appropriation,
which the directors propose to apply as follows :
To Balance Shareholders’ Dividend
and Bonus to 31st Dec., 1895,
being at the rate of 10 per
cent, per annum £750 0 0
„ Reserve Fund, making that fund
now £12,000 2000 0 0
„ Carry forward 1478 6 7
£4228 6 7
The conservative policy of the Board has been
continued during the past year, and holdings on
many classes of risks have been reduced.
The care exercised in the acceptance of business,
and the cancelment and refusal of risks of a doubt-
ful nature, has resulted most satisfactorily, as evi-
denced by the small amount paid for losses, the
ratio to nett premium income being less than
17 per cent.
The funds, including paid-up capital, after pro-
vision for all outstanding claims and payment of
the dividend and bonus, now amount to £28,478,
being more than 210 per cent, of the premium
income.
The amount which would be required to re-
insure all risks current is £4510.
The Dividend to Shareholders is now payable at
the offices of the Company, and the Bonus to
Policyholders is payable on renewal of policies.

RAZOR
Editor Bulletin, —You lately printed a
letter re the originators of the A.W.U. amalgama-
tion scheme. It matters little who originated or
organised it, for the whole affair is obviously a
farce as far as the shed laborers are concerned.
Every office in t he organisation is held by shearers.
A laborer aspiring to office i 3 simply ridiculed.
Shed laborers working with non-Union shearers at
full Union rate of wages are denounced as “scabs,”
while shearers, so far, have been perfectly satisfied
to shear with under-paid non-Union laborers so long
as j6l per 100 and Union agreement was obtained
for themselves. Shearers don’t think the poorly-
paid “ loppy ” worth consideration, and, because he
earns less, look down upon him as an inferior
kind of being ; yet, though the average shearer
regards a rouseabout as so much dirt, he
expects him (the humor of it!) to stand out
with him and battle for his (the shearer’s) =£l per
100, which seems the whole aim and object of the
A.W.U., and absorbs most of its officers’ time and
mind —forgetting the factthat laborers aremembers
and contribute to official salaries, &c., as well as
shearers. Shearers also forget or wilfully over-
look the fact that the rouseabouts, most of whom
can shear more or less, and would.have been more
useful to squatters than men got from large cities
during strikes, could have overthrown the A.S.U.
years ago had they wished. But they were loyal,
and assisted the shearers in all troubles purely on
principle. To my knowledge only two officers
(Thos. White and Donald MacDonald, of Bourke
branch A.W.U.) have ever sincerely taken up the
shed-laborer’s cause since the amalgamation has
been established. I mention these names because
the writer of above-mentioned letter demanded
accuracy in the matter, and considered it part of
Australian history.—6 x 8.
Spielmann, in his History of Punch,
notices that the thick atmosphere of hard and fast
conventionality surrounding that dreadful literary !
poultice has “ dulled even the brilliancy of Phil
May’s pencil.”
On Glenthomson, Vic., a number of sheep
have developed a fleece of a queer kind. The first
four months’ growth of the fleece is chocolate, the
next four months’ is white, and for the last four
i the colpr is black. The bands are very even
throughout, and clearly marked.
The largest calculus ever removed by
operation from the human bladder is one in a
Brussels museum, weighing 31b. ihoz., and 17in.
in circumference. In London Royal College of
Surgeons is the second biggest, weighing 21b.
lOloz., and Bin. long by 4in. diameter ; while Cam-
bridge University Museum has the third largest
weight, 21b. flgoz., length, 15in., breadth, 1.3 2 in.
This last, however, was removed after death.
Eno’s “Fruit Salt.” —A gentleman writes
“ In cases of bilious headaches, followed by severe
attacks of fever, Eno’s ‘Fruit Salt’ has acted
like a charm, when all other treatment failed.
The day is not far distant when the neglect of its
use in all fevers and diseases resulting from
poisoned blood will be considered criminal.”
“I am very much pleased with your ‘Fruit
Salt,’ I have fully proved its great efficacy by its
having entirely cured me of indigestion.”—T.

Beastly Jolly
Jolly Beastly
When school breaks up ;
When school begins again.
That’s how the English schoolboy puts it, according to Max O’Rell.
The “ jolly beastly ” period is at hand.
Boxes and trunks, hauled with reluctance out of their hiding-
places, must be packed.
The
Question arises :
WHAT ABOUT CLOTHES?
Jack cannot face the school with those shabby things he came home in.
Tlio Answer suggests itself
where economy is practised-
“ Leave it, t;o Miarlc Foy.”
Tell Jack, when he leaves for Sydney, to call at MARK FOY’S,
and he will be fitted out with as nice a suit and treated as well
as we hope he deserves.
If Jack cannot call, this list may help you when packing his trunk.

Maryborough’s (Vic.) chief quartz show is the
Sharp and Barry Amalgamated, working on the Leviathan
reef. Co. last year milled 7734 tons for 3274£0z. and paid
£3750 in divs. Now driving for the reef at a lower level
(360 ft.), and expects to cut it 40ft. in, a result upon which
hinges the development of several other claims on the
line. Since ’9O the stone taken from the two amalgams
have averaged 14dwts.

Thirty years since the first Vic. bore for alluvial

A vegetable Ohow in a Vic. mining township
had a big boulder in his cabbage garden, and hired a
drayman to shift it the other day. While thus engaged,
the white barbarian noticed gold in the stone which,
when put through at a neighboring battery, gave lioz.
Then a claim, “ the Chinaman’s Luck,” was pegged out in
the middle of the chagrined Chow’s asparagus-bed.

A mining man at Sheep station (Vic.) writes
The Bulletin : “ The reports you see from the rush here
read well in the matter of returns, but, as The Bulletin
puts it, from 10 to 20oz. to the ton is very fine—when you
get the ton. Most of the best crushings, well as they
look on paper, have not paid wages for the getting of the
stone, and in most cases the gold has vanished after a
few tons of stuff have been taken out. 20 tons is a good
patch. 1 doubt if the gold raised since the rush has paid
tucker-bills. Still, I must say that the few claims in the
district that are good are working large and seemingly
permanent bodies.” The latest from the district is the
alleged discovery of a 7ft. reef looking like 20 or 30oz.

John Hotson, the “ hand-selled ” mutton-man,
and hero of a wicked Melb. joke, reports an increase for
1895, of about 25 per cent, on his frozen sheep shipments
of the previous year. Some 204,000 carcases passed
through the Newport freezing works, and an advance on
this substantial output is predicted for ’96. Hotson’s
report is a calm, businesslike production, which makes
the barest reference to his recent visit to England, and
says nothing at all about those flights of mutton oratory
chronicled by the cable.

Charters Towers ’95 yield, 251,5770 z. from
249,620 tons. This is about 12,0000 z. less than ’94, which
was the record year. It is, however, greater than the
output from the whole of W.A. Divs., £248,000; calls,
£92,815. The Brilliant and St. George headed the div.
list with £57,600, followed closely by the Brilliant and
Mills United, the last-named producing the most gold,
viz., 37,8430 z. The progress of the Towers’ deepest show,
Brilliant Extended, will be closely watched during 96.
Remarks Alan Bright's Circular : “ The mine has an
enormous quantity of stone in sight.”
* * * *
Things have been lively last year (’95) on the
Etheridge and Woolgar. The great trouble has been want
of water. The Upper Percy has dwindled to nothing,
while Gilberton has attracted a mining party from the
Towers. Warden Haldane calls the Etheridge the poor
man’s Eldorado, and points with pride to the miners who
depart for other fields, and nearly always return to the
old place.

(S. A.) mine. Salting in Australia is so common and prose-
cutions for it so rare that it has been regarded as one of
the customs of the country. The fact that anyone in
Australia should be hauled up on a charge of “ salting ”
really surprises the large and experienced brigade who
have practised it with impunity and success. To salt a
gold-mine is as easy as falling off a log; to convict a
“ salter ” (unless he is as big a fool as he is a knave) is the
hardest thing on earth. It was once the practice to
employ professional “salters,” some of whom were real
artists in their business, in which they took much pride.
But a black sheep, turned up in a man who received lOOoz.
of gold to salt a crushing. He was engaged because of his
known salting accomplishments, but the clean-up showed
beyond a doubt that he had stuck to the gold and the
mine was not sold. When accused of the theft he proudly
struck his chest and said: “How dare you say I was
employed to salt your mine ? ” He issued a writ and got
lots of damages for slander. His conduct administered a
death-blow to the profession, and since then the honest
miner has done his own salting with a large amount of
success.
Four miners held the claim in which they
worked. The vein looked like getting poorer, and each,
unknown to the other, determined to get out, and to so
salt the next crushing as to cause the local mugs who
held the other half of the claim to buy him out. Each,
of course, deducted the gold he put in from the total, and
even then the yield was so good that each, again unknown .
to his mates, decided to buy in instead of selling out, and
they then had the whole claim. The explanation came
with the next crushing.
A good way to salt a stream-tin mine is to run a
lot of good tin-wash over a flat, and offer for sale when
the grass has grown well over it. The greatest diamond-
swindle of the age was worked in this way in America.
There is nothing easier than to salt a mine. “ Have you
ever salted a mine?” once asked the writer of an
innocent-looking digger in N.S. W. “ Salted a mine. Have
I ever salted 40 mines ? ” was his reply. With so many
lovely mining experts in W.A., some rare salting inci-
dents must have occurred. The Bulletin invites compe-
tition in salting yarns, and offers half a trunkful of
mining-scrip as first prize.

SPORTING NOTIONS
Harry Musgrove may find his post as manager
of the ’96 Australian team no sinecure. He will often
have to travel day and night, and to drink with at least
CO people, make about 30 speeches daily, and every morn-
ing at 3 o’clock make the round of the pubs, and gather
up the drunks of the team, and on his return be careful
not to trip over the inebriates who have accumulated on
the pub. mats during his absence. Musgrove, as manager
of an opera co., has had experience of the eccentri-
cities of the ladies with their golden hair a-hanging down
their backs, but he will find an Australian cricket-team
on the loose in England slightly different. For instance,
there is one man, who may possibly go this time, who has
a standing theory that he cannot make a score unless he
has had six rums, several long-beers, and numerous
whiskies the night before; and unless Musgrove exercises
great diplomacy that batsman will go through a window
if interfered with in his programme. The great qualities
required in a manager are discretion, a colossal thirst, and
the power to settle brawls arising from mixed liquors and
jealousy ; but a man who has managed an opera co., and
is still alive, deserves respect, anyway.
Many prominent patrons of the sport, altogether
outside the cricket-ring, don’t view the contemplated
’Ome trip in a very favorable light, for obvious reasons.
The batsmen may be trusted to shape well, but the bowl-
ing promises to be insufferably weak ; so much so, in fact,
that it will probably be treated with contempt. Under
the circumstances, a win in any of the test-matches seems
rather improbable. A few fast, rousing stump-scatterers
are required, but the cultivation of a lightning-delivery is
a lost art. Perhaps it’s just as well, for the wicket-
keeper’s sake.

Graham beat Lyons for the last Australian
Eleven average by a fraction. Up to a certain time in
England Graham had not made a duck. But one match
the ball struck his pads and went for four. Leg-byes,
said the umpire. But at lunch Graham said to Grace :
“ Doctor, I touched that ball with my bat.” “ Allright,”
said Grace, “ I’ll have the mistake altered.” So the score
of four was given Graham. “It will get you the average,”
remarked Coningham. So it did.

Blackham has gone with the Aus. Eleven to
England every trip since ’7B-eight visits in all. A. Ban-
nerman and Boyle have been six times, Bonnor and
Spofforth five times. Geo. Giffen has had four trips,
Turner three.
* * * *
Of Aus. Elevens that have visited England, the
most successful was Murdoch’s ’B2 team, which won 23
matches, lost 4, and drew 11. The least successful was
Murdoch’s ’9O team, which won 13, lost 16, and drew 9.
M'Donnell’s ’BB team played most matches, 40; Blackham’s
’93 team the least, 36. Altogether Aus. Elevens have
played 297 matches in England, won 139, lost 55, drawn 88.
The ’B5-6 team drew 22 matches out of 39.
* * * »
The highest score ever made in England by
an Australian Eleven man against English players was
Murdoch’s 286, in ’B2 ; he made 211 in ’B4. Massie scored
206 in ’B2, Graham 219 in ’93, and Lyons 191 in ’93. The
’7B team had only one individual century score - C. Ban-
nerman’s 133 ; the ’BO team one also, Murdoch’s 153. The
’B2 team recorded five individual centuries and two double
centuries ; the ’B4 team put up four individual centuries
and one 200 ; the 'B5 team got five individual centuries,
the ’BB three, the ’9O two, the ’93 eleven and one 200.

The teetotallers of past Australian Elevens have

Burn, MTlwraith, Jack Edwardes, Walter Giffen, and—

A. E. Trott and Iredale will be the draw of the
next Australian Eleven. They were the new men who
achieved feats against Stoddart’s team, and Stoddart and
Co. have been advertising them in England.

A lot of new blood will be in the next Aus.
Eleven : Darling, Hill (S. Aus.); A. E. Trott, either Lewis
or Johns (Vic.) or Kelly (N.S.W.), perhaps Ead.v (Tas.) ;
Iredale, Donnan, Howell or M’Kibbin (N.S.W.). Seven
new men can almost safely be reckoned on.
Graham has been once to England, Syd. Gregory
twice, H. Trott thrice.
Phil. Sheridan : “ We surely could never leave
Donnan out of the next Aus. Eleven ; he’s a mortal
enemy to the other side, a regular fighter ; if the game
is going against his side he’s as keen or keener than ever ;
his boots don’t weigh 141 b. each like some of our players’
boots do in an uphill struggle.”

Guess the brilliant Australian cricketer who,
when a certain Aus. Eleven was in England, would come
to the manager and, with pain-drawn, woe-begone face,
say : “ Oh-h-h 1 dreadful pain ! may I go and see a
doctor?” The manager would consent. Then the bril-
liant one would crawl away to the nearest hotel, and suck
down the first pint without pausing for breath.
* * * •
Australian Elevens receive in England 50 per
cent, of .the gate ; that is, of the shillings and sixpences—
they don’t get a copper of-the additional charges for
grand-stands, &c., not even when ss. a-piece is being paid
for chairs. N.S.W. Wheelman’s League should wear this
fact in its hat. Also, the fact that Australian-Eleven
attractions have pulled English counties out of debt.
* * * •
Blackham’s thumb is still so tender that a fillip
with a finger-nail striking it would cause the blood to
spurt. Turner’s right hand forefinger is in much the
same bad state, and alone, so many cricket savants say,
quite debars him from the Aus. Eleven.

How long is Marylebone Club to dictate cricket
law to all the players of the earth ? For 100 years it has
ladled out whatever rules of the game its council decided
upon ; most of them improving, some of them childish
and illogical. Yet not one English county club has raised
its voice in protest, apparently regarding the Marylebone
club as a fetish like Queen Victoria or Westminster Abbey.
Neither has Australia so far claimed to have its say in the
manufacture of the game it plays; though 20 years have
elapsed since its teams have fairly held their own with the
best that England can produce. The Australian game of
football is subject to a thorough overhauling at stated
intervals—not by the small Melb. coterie who fathered it,
but by a council including representatives of all the pro-
vinces, even of those where the game is little played.
Why not so with cricket ? Surely Australia can claim a
voice in the making of the game it plays so much—and so
well.
* * * *
Percy M ‘Donnell is now being freely tipped in
Melb. as captain of the Australian team. Harry Boyle,
who has been watching him closely all the season, says he
was never in better form, and with Garrett unavailable
there is no man better qualified to lead a team. But
there seems to be a reason or two why M'Donnell should
not lead a representative Australian team.

M‘G. : Somebody objects, in a recent Bulletin,
to the legs of the racing cyclist. Granted that Zimmer-
man possesses a most ugly pair of supports, and that
Martin’s are masses of shapeless muscle, what about the
other men in the first flight ? Parsons and Harris might
each stand for sculptors’ models ; they are short, but sym-
metrical. Porta’s legs are shapely, but, owing to his
habit of letting his socks fall into his shoes, do not appear
so. Pither, Kirk, Carpenter, Iredale, Walker, and a host
of others are men of almost perfect nether development.
The cyclist—the racing cyclist—has, in nine cases out of
ten, a well-developed leg. The very nature of his sport
renders such almost compulsory : though, of course, a
good man with spindle-shanks is occasionally met—for
instance, Middleton, who has calves on his heart instead
of his legs, and wins his races thereby.

Apropos the debate as to who was the first
bicycle rider in Australia, Mr. Percy Clay, West Mait-
land’s telegraph master, declares that those who fix the
years 1868 and 1869 as the date of the introduction of the
machine into Victoria have not, metaphorically speaking,
a leg to stand on. As far back as 1866, Mr. Olay rode a
bike from Warrnambool to Famham Park— returning (tor
several reasons) with his iron steed in a potato-cart.

All the spoils of Zimmerman’s cycling victories
have gone down the Nimrod-Zimmy Company’s sink, it is
said.

Prominent Melb. bikists are now “riding the
high horse,” in imitation of Martin and Porta. Zim.
says it’s a mistake. “Use a high gear and you may
become a successful plugger. A low gear is required for
brilliancy in racing.”

Dear Bulletin, —I notice that cash-amateur-
cyclists’ stock is unsaleable in your paper. Well, the
cash-amateur may be a bit of a rogue now and then, but
the lily-white amateur never rises above the fool. I was
a lily-white amateur, spent £5OO in cycles, trainer s ex-
penses, &c., and I raced for cups and medals. I have
many of these gimcracks now—£lo cups, £2O ones, £5
ones, &c., worth respectively 55., 10s., and 2s. 6d ; the
&c. lot is worth nothing. These represent my scoop for
that £5OO, my time and energies. I’ll give them to you,
if you like—they’ll stand as a concrete explanation of why
the amateurs race for cash. —Key.

Young bikers, as a rule, seem to have faith m a
glorious resurrection of Zimmerman within a few months.
The Bulletin reckons him a “goner” beyond recovery of
first-class form. He’s six-and-twenty, anyway, and
cycling glory up to now has been confined to small-headed
boys of ill-balanced physique, who break up under the
strain of love and matrimony. The present style of bike
champion is not likely to endure long at anything, nor is
it very probable that'the class will improve. Men with
good chests, necks, and brain-power might last into the
thirties, but when a certain medical theory has been
fairly proved, no brainy individual will dream of being a
racing cyclist. Also, the girls will cease to find any
attraction in the nubbly-legged heroes with the tight-
fitting pants.

Zim. ’s last words in Australia on cycling were
that the game in N.S.W. will be a bigger success than
ever; that the Vic’s, by mismanagement, will spoil things;
that Parsons is as good as Harris ; that Martin is a clever
rider on a fast track ; that he himself was beaten by un-
suitable climate, by business worry, and by bad light and
night racing.
When Zimmerman first came to Australia, The
Bulletin pointed out that circumstances over which Zim.
had no control would stop him striking form. His Aus-
tralian tour - his honeymoon tour—was his first failure.
It was the first time he tried to make his cycle carry two.
* * * *
The immediate effect of The Bulletin’s com-
ments on Melb. Bicycle Club management was to remind
that money-making concern of its former compromise
with creditors—some of whom, by the wajq stood out for
their pound of flesh and were paid in full. Those who
had accepted 7s. in the £ two or three years ago received
the balance of their abandoned claims “as a mark of the
M.B.C.’s gratitude, as well as of its integrity” (vide the
admiring A nous), arid last Thursday they all partook of a
banquet at the club-rooms, in celebration of this joyful
event.
* * * *
The Warrnambool bike races furnished fine
sport for any local “mugs” who wagered on the heats.
Three international scratch events were bracketed
together, the prize-money being awarded on points—
five for each win, three for a second place, and one for a
third. Martin took the one-mile, just beating Harris,
with Pither third, and Porta last. Pither took the three-
miles, just beating Martin, with Porta and Harris close
behind. Then Martin captured the five-miles (and £2O
stake), 2ft. in front of Porta, with Harris third, and
Pither last this time. After which Martin, Pither, and
Porta came out for an invitation mile, and Porta, who
finished last for the previous race over the same course,
won by a length from Martin, in 7sec. longer time than
the Irish-Yank. had needed for his victorious journey. If
all this be genuine “form,” and The Bulletin doesn’t
question its honesty, bike racing among “ champions ” is
not worth intelligent discussion. The Bendigo folk came
to this way of thinking before their Xmas cycling sports
were finished.
* * * *
The League of Vic. Wheelmen will assert itself
with a two Saturdays race-meeting at the M.C.O. Ground
—Feb. Ist. and Bth. The management advertises a
liberal programme, all things considered. £l3O is given
to the principal handicap, a two-mile event. The ten
mile and five mile scratch races are worth £4O apiece,
including a gold medal (the medal to be charged by the
ounce, presumably), and some minor handicaps bring the
total amount of prize-money up to £3OO. Also, the
scratch races carry champion titles with them, which
sounds satisfactory, since the public mind has been getting
rather mixed as regards champions. Porta, Martin,
Harris, Pither and Co. will fight their battles some more.
These cycling rivals are indefatigable.
* * * *
Why don’t the police keep an eye on the scales
of the cycling shops? A Melb. man lately ordered a
machine not to exceed 251 b. weight, and was supplied
with a jigger which, when slung on the agent’s spring
balance, went just 241 b. The bargain was closed, the
deposit paid, and the cyclist rode off—only to find, three
weeks later, on placing it upon a platform scales, that it
brought down 29Jlb.
* * * *
The racing cyclist will soon have another avenue
open to him by the introduction of an invention which,
attached to the gear of an ordinary bicycle, reduces the
distance covered nearly a thousandfold. For instance,
anyone who wants a 10-mile spin on a wet night, only
needs to fix the new mechanism on his machine and ride
50ft. along his back verandah. To cover this distance
will take the average man 37 minutes, and if he
sprints the last 6 in. he will take another hour to re-
cover. But the enormous possibility that opens is the race
on the stage. Imagine what a draw a 5-mile match between
Zimmerman, Harris, and Parsons would be if conducted
on the stage of, say, Melb. Opera House. How the
triplet would scorch for the first 4ft., as the audience
would see it, and how the final inch would be battled for
by the three of them, head to head for a single five
minutes!

Dear Bulletin,—l note that Norman Selfe
claims to have won the first bicycle race at Sydney. He
did ride a race on a bicycle, but against 3 and 4-wheel
velocipedes. Did you ever see a sulky race a tip-dray ?
The first race between bicycles was won by Wm. Good-
ridge, at the Albert Ground, about 1870. Selfe was a
competitor, and was beaten easily.—R.J.C.

Dear Bulletin, —You claim the ped. as the
most symmetrically-built athlete, dismissing the pug as
being small below and the cyclist as small above the
waist. Now, take the man who is well developed both
above and below, the oarsman, and you have, I think a
far better man than either ped., cyclist, or pug. Rowing
as everybody isn’t aware, needs more body-work than
anything else, and as much leg-work as cycling ; conse-
quently, the rower is well developed all over. He misses
nothing in his exercise. It is all very well to point out
Larry Marsh as well built. He is ; but he is the exception
not the rule. The average ped. hasn’t any arms to speak
of, whereas every oarsmen anywhere near the front
rank has a strong, well-proportioned frame. The runner
is no doubt evenly built, what there is of him—so prob-
ably, were the Liliputians. But for producing a big
well-built man, commend me to the outrigger Just look
at some of them—Beach, Searle, Hanlan, Rush, and anv
other good man you like, all real manly men—men you
find yourself looking after and admiring in the street

Wheelmen’s League, on Sydney Agricultural Ground’ the
total prizes amount to £304 ; the Australian Cup (two

♦ * * *
TheN.S.W. Wheelmen’s League will exclude
the tandem-pacer from the next big test-race, and induce
fast going throughout by giving lap prizes to the man
who passes the post first each lap. Which will mean t.W
A and B, who are mates, will enter together for the race
-that A will take the lead from the jump and keep it
throughout to pace B Then, of course, in the
last lap B will shoot ahead and win. The new wav of
the league is merely the old, old way which was resoon
sible for many “ jobs. How often since the cash-amateur
has been scorching for the glittering gold has a stiff >un in
an unpaced raoe offered to paoe another man for a con-
sideration ? ...
The N.S.W. Wheelmen’s League is falling-out
badly with itself. Prior to the league’s Jf f,
little band of devoted cyclists called one another Dick,
“ Billy,” and so on. Then, astonished at their own suc-
cess, the leading spirits, after the formatin of the league,
got themselves top-hats and long coats. But, alas, the
rank-and-file cyclists didn’t respect those to P- ha )®
long coats. They still persisted in calling the owners
“ Billy ” “ Jerry,” &c. Flesh and blood of league au™™*
rity couldn’t stand that. They gave one cyclist, called
Joe, to understand that he must “Mister’ them. Joe
said, “Go and take the handle off yourself. You call me
‘ Joe,’then I’ll call you ‘Jerry.’” Joe was sent up for
three months for “ contempt of the committee.

The rumble of Turf reform is now heard in
Melb , but there are indications that the essentially con-
servative V.R.C. committee will heap obstacles in the way
on Feb. 10. The committee-men would rather have the
kudos attached to introducing desirable reforms themselves,
but it never occurred to them to take the lead. Also,
their amendments would probably have assumed a
much milder shape than those now tabled by member
Gaunson and others, so nothing but strong opposition is
likely to be offered to anything so awfully drastic and
positively offensive, doncherknow.
Why the Metropolitan Club controllers haven’t
made some effort at turf purification long ere now is a
puzzle. Sooner or later they’ll have to do so, or the
public will be pulling out its handkerchief at the very
mention of the word “ horse.” In these days of squared
juries the papers can’t afford to libel individual jockeys
or stewards every day—yet that seems the only way of
drawing attention to the huge Australian cesspit,-mis-
called the turf.
Stewards prefer discussing protests, cronk run-
ning, &c., in a comfortable tea-party way; the presence
of the press would be irksome and irritating. But the
public would be more satisfied if they knew more about
these enquiries. That stewards make small and swell
bets is notorious, and the assertion that cash doesn’t
influence them is bunkum. Yet decisions against weight
of evidence wouldn’t be likely in the presence of the
press, unless the latter happened to have its little bit on
as well as the stewards.
* * * •
At a primitive M.L. fixture once a local owner
protested against a visiting winner. The stewards’ room
also served as accident, press, drinking and smoking
apartment. So the scribes were handed a bottle and told
to take no notice. The chair : “ I propose the protest be
upheld. There’s something in it.” Someone objected.
“ What! Do you know the lodger of the protest owes me
a tenner, your -brother over there a fiver, besides £6 to
the club for entries ? And how the ’ell do you think we’re
going to get it if we don’t give him the stake ? The club
can’t afford bad debts. Those in favor say ‘ aye ’ —the
ayes have it.”

For the sake of the malodorous Australian turf,
it is to be hoped that lawyer O’Halloran will carry out his
threat of suing a Melb. weekly paper for libel. O’Halloran
seems bound to carry out his threat. He is in the legal
trade, and can get his action done comparatively on the
cheap. Tiik Bulletin hopes that Providence will fight on
the side of truth, whichever that may be, and not neces-
sarily with the biggest battalions of witnesses.
The little weekly in question ventured to men-
tion that Mr. C. D. O’Halloran, otherwise “0. Denis,”
was called before the Mentone stewards lately to
explain the running of his filly, Dowry. A good
subject for mention, inasmuch as the precious Argus
and Age had been strangely silent on the point,
notwithstanding the sporting interest which is naturally
taken ■in Mr. O’Halloran. He is the new VA T C
steward, appointed in place of Mr. Anderson, who’ ten-
dered his resignation after “J. B. Clark” had made
things unpleasant for him re the notorious Lardy-Dardy
case, so that the fierce light that beats upon a throne was
fairly entitled to illuminate the dealings of this turf
potentate. Why didn’t the “ respectable ” daily news-
papers call attention to Dowry’s allegedly unsatisfactory
performance by stating that the filly’s owner had been
requested to account for it, and had disarmed suspicion
with his explanation? Also, why wasn’t the explanation
published ?
Thus far, then, the weekly journalfin question
appears to have done Mr. O’Halloran no wrong He ought
to be and doubtless is, sorry that the daily newspapers
held their leaden tongues concerning Dowry’s running at
Mentone, and the innocent complexion he (the owner!
was at once able to put upon it. Dowry’s running seems
to have excited suspicion, but Mr. O’Halloran proved to
the Mentone stewards that said suspicion was a libel on
his honor. Anyhow, his explanation was accepted The
newspaper appears to have angered Mr. O’Halloran with
the tone of its comments on the Mentone incident
The offending journal, instead of confining itself to
a oare narrative of the gentleman’s bad luck in being con-
nected with an evil-disposed filly, preferred to treat blm
as a lucky man for having been able to so easily satisfy
the Mentone stewards. Therein, of course, lav libel for
which he threatens legal vengeance. Tiie Bulletin cor-
dially advises him to go in and win if he can. The turf
the legal profession the V.A.T.C., and the Sup-press are
ahke interested m his success. On the other hand, the
public will be glad to hear all that the other side can say
in open court. *

A New Hush.
With one exception, such an influx of people, or
“a rush,” never has taken place to equal that to
West Australia at the present time. Fresh
arrivals to the West number 3000 a week, things
are at present booming, and although a few press-
men are denouncing Westralia as a bogus field,
their opposition is mostly caused by disappoint-
ment at not being amongst the fortunate. Cer-
tain% rich gold has been discovered there, some
people have made fortunes easily, and the precious
metal again proves what a powerful magnet it is.
The exception referred to above is in connec-
tion with a rush taking place all over Australasia.
Watch any tobacconist shop and you will notice
it. Frossard’s Cavour Cigars, in packets of eight
for Is., are a delicious, mild and fragrant smoke,
and so popular that immediately a shipment
arrives they are at once bought up. Until lately
the supply has not nearly equalled the demand,
but the manufacturers, having increased their
premises and employes, and obtained contracts for
a splendid crop of leaf, hope to keep the market
regularly supplied. Frossard’s Cavour Cigars, in
packets of eight for Is., have caused the biggest
rush ever seen in the colonies, and are spoken of
throughout the world as the most marvellous weed
of the day.*

Probably few men who commenced at the bottom
of the ladder have become more widely and favour-
ably known or more successful than Mr. A. F.
Spawn, of 122, Pall Mall, London, for some years
a resident of Melbourne. That he is a man of
great resource cannot be doubted when we read
that he was the original inventor of the Hand
Grenade Fire Extinguisher, also many other in-
ventions of minor importance, and recently per-
fected a scientific hot air apparatus for curing and
preserving fruits and vegetables on a large,
practical, and economical scale, which is being
adopted, not only in England, but in Holland,
Australia, and America. Mr. Spawn was ap-
pointed by a Syndicate some years ago to investi-
gate the process of growing and preserving fruits
in Australia, and while there started a well-organ-
ised and successful irrigation colony in that
country. In fact, as a public lecturer and adviser
on colonisation and irrigation he probably stands
to-day unrivalled. Business has brought him in
contact with people of skill in every part of the
globe, and naturally he has been through many
adventures, some pleasing and others dangerous ;
but the most astonishing adventure he recently
experienced right here in London, and imme-
diately after his return from an extended tour of
immigration investigation on the Pacific Coast of
America. Mr. Spawn’s own words explain clearly
how he was attacked, and how he escaped. “I
had always been uncommonly strong and healthy,
and have not known a day’s illness during my
past ten years’ travels and adventures, and was
always able to scoff at disease, but a few weeks
ago, on leaving my office at Pall Mall, I was over-
come with giddiness, and this recurred frequently
during the next few days ; I began to notice a
bitter taste in my mouth, and my tongue seemed
coated and burning ; my appetite left me—could
not enjoy the greatest delicacy, everything I ate
seemed to distress me, and caused spasmodic pains
in the pit of my stomach, and flatulency; my
complexion turned sallow, and the customary
office duties required more exertion than I could
seemingly command. My ailment also seemed to
make me nervous, and tended to cause melancholy
and gloomy feelings. I tried chemists’ and doc-
tors’ medicines, and kept growing worse.
“ I had always derided medicines outside the
regular channels, and although I had heard
Warner’s Safe Cure favourably spoken of for liver
diseases, not only in England, but Australia and
America, I never thought of using it; but for-
tunately a friend who knew of my suffering
succeeded in overcoming my prejudice, and I
decided to try it. Almost from the first dose the
disagreeable symptoms began to lessen in severity.
In a few days I was able to enjoy light food, and
after using four bottles all the above described
symptoms had entirely disappeared. I know now
what to do if my liver gets out of order, or if there
are signs of an approaching bilious attack, and
oertainly can recommend this medicine to others
with candor and confidence.” There can be no
question as to the soundness of the views expressed
dr advice given by a gentleman of Mr. Spawn’s
standing, and your experience will be just as satis-
factory if you are guided thereby.*

Messrs. Myers and Solomon, who have
traded in Sydney for nearly fbrty years as
general importers and commission merchants,
have resumed business at 42 Market - street,
Sydney. The new firm starts quite free and
unencumbered from any liabilities connected
with the old establishment. Messrs. Myers
and Solomon were the original founders of
the business, and their very long experience
makes them eminently fitted to carry on the busi-
ness to the best advantage. The firm recom-
mences business just when most of the import
duties are removed, and thus gets a considerable
start of competitors who have large duty-paid
stocks on hand.*

ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a

easier. If not saved for the Newmarket, and given a
start, \\ hakawat-ea (8.11) has a genuine chance. Writer

Y.R.C. committee regards as impracticable the
proposition that scratchings shouldn’t be allowed after
noon on the day previous to the races, unless a valid
excuse is tendered. If applied to all manner of trum-
pery meetings, of which the public take little notice, that
might be so ; but it’s a workable scheme so far as big han-
dicaps are concerned. Late scratchings through spite
against sweep-ticket-holders, or failure to work a good
stable com. at long odds, or because ‘ 1 I’m always un-
lucky on that course,” have occurred often enough.
* * * *
A special meeting of the Y.R.C. has been called
to deal with a proposed alteration in the rules, by which
owners must scratch their horses by noon on race-day,
except in special cases. Under the present style, horses,
which it is never intended to start, are brought down to
the course for double-event purposes. Backers see them
on the course and take them in doubles, only to And them
scratched just before the race.

Dear Bulletin, — The obvious reason for a
sporting tipster’s invariable failure to tip a winner, or get
near to so doing, is his want of brains. That is pre-
suming he knows something of the subject and tries his
best to hit the mark. After a tipster has collected a cer-
tain amount of possible truth, derived from facts, sug-
gestions, hints, indirect evidence, or reasonable con-
clusions founded on experience, concerning certain horses
likely to start for a certain race, he has then to weigh
each bit of “ information ”in his mind. He must con-
sider, not only the horses, but the men connected with
them, and the probabilities of some men having less, or
more, good reason for their confidence than other men.
You say, “The only way to get reliable tips is to be
Platonic friend to the best girls of leading jockeys.”
Given such a Platonic friend, and supposing that he knew
the latest ideas of every stable that fancied its chance
the well-informed individual’s knowledge is dangerous
unless he can bring a wise discrimination to bear upon his
estimate of the conflicting fancies. He can do no more.
He can’t foresee good or bad luck. These remarks apply
only to big races in which “goers” are many, not to
pettifogging events that are, to a large extent, arranged
21 hours or 24 minutes before the start. To discuss them
seriously in a weekly newspaper is absurd.—Yours, Stable
Cat.

Ex-Governor Hopetoun fires off a ten-page
article on “ Sport in Australia” in last Badminton Maga-
zine. Sport, according to H.E.’s view, seems to include
only horse-racing, golf, polo and other high-toned insti-
tutions-for neither football, cricket, sculling, cycling and
stoushing get even a mention.

Gov. Hopetoun says almost in so many words
that the three fences are put so close together, before
the grand-stand, in order that the ladies may enjoy the
accidents.

The racers in W.A. at present seem very poor.
Scarpia won races in the West with lOst. up, but cannot
win around Melb. with 7st. ; whilst Carbonate, who, a
couple of months ago, couldn’t win in the East with 6st.
71b., and appeared to be a regular bag of bones, has just
won a race in W.A. with Bst. 131 b. up.

Mr. S. Galvayne, or whoever was responsible
for the recent shipment of Australian horses to this
market (writes The Bulletin’s London correspondent),
simply invited disaster by making a bad selection. A
more fiddle-headed, inferior-looking lot it would be hard
to get together, and though they were said to be quiet in
saddle and harness no one attempted either to back or to
drive them. That low prices were realised cannot be
wondered at. For England nothing but the best of every
kind must be sent—nothing else will do. Only the best
will sell.

Dear Bulletin, —“ Hop ” makes seasonable
comment upon the phenomenon of tea-drill by old gentle-
men of the bowling temperament. Tea is obviously more
conducive to good play than three-star. I have noticed,
at many bowling-matches, that the players who stump
fattily away in occasional twos and threes are the ones
who lose. Scores of, say, 21 —20 generally mean equal
drinking capacities. Scores of, say, 31—15 mostly imply
that the losing side was inordinately drinky. But I have
never seen a rink of tea-drinking bowlers except in M.L.
prohibition districts, where adipose “ sports ” must needs
wait until they get home to their surreptitious cellars.
Under prohibition bowls would be a lost art. —Thorold W.

G. G. Stead asserts that Fabulist, who came to
tight a couple of weeks ago, is 71b. better than champion
Euroclydon, winner of N.Z. Cup, Derby, and Canterbury
Oup, and Australasian 2J-mile record-breaker. M.L.
authorities also aver that Auraria and Wallace would
have a very poor chance with either. If such is the case,
Musket’s death doesn’t seem to have affected the breed-
ing of top-notchers there in the slightest degree. Seeing
that Auraria, Wallace and Waterfall were sired by M.L.-
bred stallions, dandies of their day, that province seems
to be the best horse-breeding spot in Australasia.

Trentalto, by Trenton-Montalto, was one of the

clinking youngster in her dajc Trentalto’s latest achieve-
ment was a win, carrying top-weight, in the Hawke’s Bay
Two-year-old Handicap.

Miller’s monthly Racing Chronicle is not, thus
far, the financial success anticipated by the publisher. It
must be either that Miller over-estimated the probable
number of subscribers, or else that the handy little shilling
volume is not sufficiently well-known to race-goers. Every-
body who has discovered the value of the Chronicle ought
to assist it along towards a paying circulation.

At the recent Christchurch (M.L.) athletic
champion meeting, instead of competitors being put back
a yard for breaking, it was notified that repeated break-
ing would result in disqualification. The self-control
shown by the runners was most wonderful.
* * * *
The standards fixed at the Aust. A. A. champion
meeting in M.L. were those adopted by the Eng. Asso.,
and stamp the men who attained them as first-class
amateurs anywhere. Kingsley, of Wellington, reached
the mark (10ft.) in the pole jump, and so did Martin, of
Auckland, in the 120yds. hurdles (16 2-ssecs.). In hammer
throwing (100 ft.) Martin (104 ft. sin) and Brown (100 ft.
lin.) secured badges. Creamer, of Auckland, broke the
Australasian 3-mile walk record, doing the distance in
22min. 51 2-ssecs. Bennett, the Dunedin youngster, ran
a mile in 4min. 29 3-ssecs., going clean away from N.S.W.
Corner. Low, another Dunedinite, a great sprinter, beat
the standard (52sec.) by 2-ssec. in the 440yds. flat. Cart-
wright (Vic.) beat the standard (10 3-sth) by l-sth in the
100yds. These were on the first day. T. Roberts, of
Auckland, who hurdled for M. L. at the meeting, is the brave
man who behaved so nobly at the Wairarapa wreck. At
his own province’s recent annual champion meeting, he
won the hurdles in great - style, and he holds the world s
record time for 220yds. hurdles, but at the big Christ-
church meeting he was unable to do even a moderate per-
formance. Excepting Cartwright and Doyle (high-
jumper), the Australian amateur athletes visiting M.L.
were disappointing. t
Sydney University beat Melb. ditto by nine
wickets. Sydney put up 336 ; Melb. 189 and 176.
The Barker-bashed Placke left Sydney on Mon-
day by the Monowai for ’Murka. They say that Placke
was absolutely idolised by a well-to-do Sydney woman,
and that he could have lived on love had he chosen.

•.The first of the Australasian swimming chain-
pionships came off on 15th inst. at Sydney Natatorium.
Arrangements were so mixed that the bath might have
been whisky instead of water. The automatic winner-
indicating machine saw double on one occasion it re-
corded that Nos. 1,2, 3,4, 5 and 6 had swum a dead heat.
And only three men were in the race ; and they didn’t
swim a dead-heat either.
* * * *
Gormly put up an Australian record of 6 min.
8 sec. in the recent 440 yards Australasian swimming
Championship, which is 15 sec. worse than the English
record ; and P. Cavill put up 13 min. 27 4-sth sec. in the
half-mile ; Tyers’ (Eng.) time is 13 min. 20 sec. Peate, a
N.S.W. fat man, did a world’s record plunge of 66 ft. 10 in.
—but he stayed under water longer than the usual minute
allowance.
* * * *
The Cavill family and following, its uncles, its
brothers, its sisters, its cousins, and its aunts, was in
uproarious evidence at Windsor swimming carnival, the
men bellowing and the ladies screeching to their repre-
sentative. At intervals, too, in the mile race, they
flopped into the water and swam beside their man,
encouraging him. Had not Gormly mistaken the course
he might have won instead of having to give up. As it
was, that fine swimmer, P. Cavill, seemed to have had a
lucky win. But by what process does the estimable
Cavill family continue to swim as amateurs ? There is a
general impression that the Cavills are out-and-out pro-
fessionals, who live by the water, in the water, on the
water, for the water.
* * * *
The Maoriland swimmers will have put in their
2600 miles journey (to Sydney and back) for nothing.
Helhngs (N.S.W.) won the 220-yards Championship;
Gormly (N.S.W.), the 440; P. Cavill (N.S.W.), the half-
mile and mile. And the only Maorilander placed in these
big events was Stratton, who got third in the mile through
Gormly giving up.

Australian pugs, are flocking to Johannesburg,
the best “gate” locality in the world. M’Gowan,
Doherty, and Duggan are now plugging for cash there.
M‘Gowan left Melbourne to meet Jim Murphy, the erst
Australian; Doherty to engage with Heffernan, and
Duggan to take on Tut Ryan. When the mail left it was
doubtful if the police would permit the exhibitions after
the Goddard-Ryan show, which was the outcome of bad
blood, and generated into a slugging bout. However,
little obstacles of this kind are easily overcome in
Johannesburg.

“ Denver ” Smith has challenged the victor of
the Fitzsimmons-Maher fight. According to him, the
idea of the pair battling for the championship is simply
ridiculous. When Goddard challenged Corbett the latter
didn’t accept, and so forfeited the title. That being so,
he couldn’t present to Maher what he didn’t own. Smith,
himself, beat Goddard, and Goddard beat Maher in three
rounds, Fitzsimmons following up by knocking Maher out
in 12 at New Orleans. So Smith says Fitz. and he should
battle for the belt. Anyhow, he’ll take on any man in
the world, Yank or Englisher.

Dear Bulletin, — Re the sheep-killing record. A
friend of mine who was there, and is a good, old-fashioned

works in Oct., 1893.—E. M. Watts, Adelaide.

A certain Melb. trainer owns to a strange super-
stition. The day his prads are “ having a try ” he con-
sumes more cigars than usual. If any go out his luck
departs also, and he says he might as well scratch. One
bookie’s mascotte is a cat. Unless he fondles and
feeds it regularly before leaving home he has no luck.
Sometimes puss is absent on business of her own, and
hook-nose “falls in” sure. So the cook has a standing
order to secure the feline on race-days, and attach her to
the premises with a yard of rope.

The bicycle is a revolutionist ; it overturns one

Horses have to go, not on the streets, but from them.
Farmers find their markets for oats cut down ; new trades
are created and huge factories built; new interpretations
of the law have to be made ; ladies alter fashions that
have resisted reform for a generation ; modes of recreation
are modified ; language receives additions ; the values of
real estate are upset; new diseases are noted ; roads are
reconstructed ; and now the accident insurance companies
are rattled. They find that their old risks will not do.
They have discovered that injuries from cycle accidents
are more .serious than the average, and that riding exposes
a greater number to risk than formerly.—Amer.

The two most badly-bruised men in Mel-
bourne just now are a pair of private detectives
who were out collecting evidence in a divorce-case.
Accompanied by the jealous wife, they burst in
the door of a suburban cottage late at night in the
hope of finding something of a compromising
character, and yelled “fire ” to bring the old man
out. He came out, but only to bowl over the two
intruders and prance upon them, and when he had
sated his craving for gore, he chased one of them
off the premises and tied up the other —who had
lost most of his clothes and a lot of blood in
the course of the unpleasantness —with a rope till
the police arrived. Then he gave the shattered
mass into custody for being on the premises with-
out lawful excuse, and went back to bed.
“Shark! Shark!”
A solicitor charged with stealing £1461 of trust moneys
said “he was sorry to say he had received the money,
and had mixed it up with his money, and could not find
it.” He pleaded in excuse, however, that the money had
come to hand in instalments, and he was saving it to give
to his client all together, as the client would then “be
more likely to make some good use of it.” However,
more than half would be returned out of the bankruptcy
proceedings. A dialogue between the new solicitor and
his client drifts in just here :
Client :
O, give me, I pray you, the money you owe me—
I mean my own money, which dear uncle left;
You really must fork out, for how can you show
me
That, if you retain it, it wiM not be theft ?
Solicitor :
My dear sir, with pleasure ; but first satisfy me
That if I hand over your cash on demand
You’ll spend it discreetly ; for if you don’t—blime !
It goes to my private account —understand ?
Client :
But, sir, though my lawyer, you are not my
censor;
My money’s my own, too, to spend as I choose.
Solicitor :
Alas, ’tis my duty grave cause of offence or
Of scandal to shun —so I’ll stand in your shoes.
Yet could you but see how I’m torn by my scruples
As Meagher, too, was torn in the Waverley tram,
And Rofe, the grief-stricken . . . P’raps there
are loopholes . . .
I’ll see the Chief Justice to-morrow.
Client :
0, damn !
Solicitor :
Besides, your dear uncle has died by instalments—
At all events, drafts come to hand one by one ;
And, lest you be lured into vicious enthralments,
I’ll wait till the dribbling temptation is done.
You see, sir, my conscience—my honoured pro-
fession —
Client :
Great Emu ! this impudence passes belief !
Your conscience ! your honour ! —yes, when you’re
detected
And publicly nailed —like the penitent thief.
Solicitors nowadays, fee’d, it is true, will
Defend clients while they have money to spend
Against all antagonists. . . Good ! but pray who
will
Against their solicitors’ clients defend ?
Solicitor :
If those are your sentiments, sir, you must leave
me;
Your language is blasphemy—worse, I might
say . . .
Your money ? . . . H’m ! Yes ! . . . Well,
unless I deceive me,
You’ll see when my schedule is filed. , . , Oh,
good-day !

from the many remedies recommended to me,
I Anally tried Ayel-’s Sarsaparilla, and from
that time, I began to gain health and strength.

saparilla, and the happy results of its use. I

But What’s the Use.
A DARLING RIVER SKETCH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
But what’s the use o’ writin’ “Bush ”
Though editors demand it—
For city folk, an’ farmin’ folk?
They cannot understand it.
They’re blind to what the bushman sees
The best with eyes shut tightest—
Out where the sun is hottest an’
The stars are most an’ brightest.
The crows at sunrise floppin’ round
Where some poor life has run down ;
The pair of emus trottin’ from
The lonely tank at sundown—
Their snaky heads well up, an’ eyes
Well out for man’s manoeuvres,
An’ feathers bobbin’ round behind
Like fringes round improvers.
The swagman trampm cross the plain —
Good Lord, there’s nothing sadder,
Except the dog that slopes behind
His master like a shadder ;
The turkey-tail to scare the flies,
The water-bag an’ billy ;
The nose-bag gettin’ cruel light,
The trav’ler gettin’ silly.
The plain that seems to jackeroos
Like gently-slopin’ rises,
The shrubs an’ tufts that’s miles away
But magnified in sizes ;
The track that seems a-risen up
Or else seems gently slopin’,
And just a hint of kangaroos
’Way out across the open.
The joy or hope the swagman feels
R ‘turnin’, after shearin’,
Or a'ter six months’ tramp Out Back,
He strikes the final clearin’.
His weary spirit breathes again,
His achin’ legs seem limber
When to the East across the plain
He spots the Darlin’ Timber !
But what’s the use o’ writin’ bush—
Tho’ editors demand it—-
For city folk an’ cockatoos ?
They do not understand it !
They’re blind to what the whaler sees
The best with eyes shut tightest—
Out where Australyer’s widest, an’
The stars are most ’n’ brightest. *
HENRY LAWSON.
The well-known Misfit Parlor of Mr.
Nathan Herman, established for 20 years, at 9
Wynyard Square, Sydney, is now attracting more
than the ordinary crowd of customers. One line
that is contributing specially to the growth of
business is the bale system. For £2, a whole bale
of men’s useful clothing, boots, &c., can be got.
These parcels are sent by rail or steamer, free of
charge, to any part of the province. There are bar-
gains to be had all through the establishment. A
half-chest of tea, weighing nearly 401 b., can be
purchased for £1 10s., and a 121 b. tin for 10s.
When a watch and chain—the timekeeper being
guaranteed —can be had for as small a sum as 7s.
6d., hardly a schoolboy will go without those
articles. The watches are valued at £1 55., and
are despatched post-free. Brussels carpets, in the
latest designs, are offered at 2s. per yard, and the
material is valued at nearly three times the price.
All the carpeting, linoleums, and floorcloths will
be laid, free of charge, by a competent staff.
Smokers can get tobacco at 3d. per plug, and
choice Havana cigars at 6s. per box of 50, being at
the rate of under ljd. per cigar. Mr. Herman is
constantly in receipt of letters acknowledging the
great bargains his customers have made. The
suit a Cowra man got in his £2 bale, together with
a large number of articles of wearing apparel, he
said was worth at least £4. From Bathurst, a
man wrote stating he reckoned the tea he had got
at a cost of about lOd. was worth 2s. per lb.*
At Allan vale, Vic., rabbits are being got
rid of by blocking all the burrows but two. Into
one of these a syphon from a big watertank on a
dray is inserted, and the warren thus flooded. At
the other stands a man who seizes the bunnies one
by one as they rush out to escape the water.
The “patriarch” of N.S.W. liquordom is
publican Davidson, who has the monopoly of the
Sydney horse-sale yards at Camperdown, and in
whose parlor hundreds of thousands sterling
change hands annually—the horse-auction business
being conducted on a strictly spot-cash basis.
Mr. Davidson has been licensed for 35 years. J
Melb. St. Patrick’s Cathedral, after being
about 40 years in the building, is to be opened at
last on the first Sunday in November next.
Cancer is largely on the increase in Maori-
land, the number of cases having risen from 2'69
per 10,000 persons living in 1881 to over 6 per
10,000 last year. Six men die there of cancer
yearly for every five women.
Victoria’s rainfall last year was only 17in.,
or Bin. below the average. At Mount Lyell, Tas.,
however, the record was 12ft.
Cabled that Prince Henry of Battenberg,
who went with the Ashantee expedition (which
reached Coomassie safely and obtained the King’s
submission) contracted fever and was invalided to
the coast.

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir, —In the year of 1871 I was eight days
in the water sheep-washing, and contracted rheu-
matism and stiffness in the joints, and have tried
all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney
I had a great difficulty in walking, and went to
the Turkish baths, which did no good. Passing
your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E.
W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as
I had, which led me to try your Remedies. On
Thursday before Good Friday I took the first of
your Pills; since then I have used 4 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with Liver
and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline
Eucalyptus Oil, and I am now, with the blessing
of God, as well in health as I was 23 years ago.
I can with great confidence recommend your
Remedies to anyone suffering from the same com-
plaint. May you long be spared under God to
be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully,
JOHN KEAY.

a sufferer from General Debility of the Nervous

without success several of the leading doctors
both in Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to
try your Alfaline Remedies. lam thankful I did
so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies
I am now completely cured, and I shall be most
happy to recommend your remedies to anyone
suffering as I was. Thanking you for your

A well-known Melb. penlady, on a recent
Sunday, pedalled to Sorrento and back—l2o
miles—and, after tea, wrote up her trip for her
paper.
The new Westralian daily, the Morning
Herald, started with the new year. Gordon
Stronaoh, late of Town and Country Journal
and of the defunct Sydney Echo, is sub-editor.
Melb. University snake-man, Davies, was,
on 4th Jan., bitten by a savage tiger snake, which
hung on to his finger for several seconds. Davies
quietly lifted the snake off, put it back in the
cage, wiped his finger on his trouser-leg, and
calmly went on “ milking ” the rest of the animals.
That was all the treatment that snakebite got—nd
Btryohnine, no chloride of lime, no anything.
Cyclist Zimmerman visited Melb. Royal
Panto, the other evening, and sat right through
the show, evidently enjoying it immensely
until it was shown now the noble, God-fearing
British were going to wipe out the Yankees and
make the Stars and Stripes into a gridiron. Then
Zim. gathered up his soft hat and, sighing more in
sorrow than in anger, passed out into Bourke-
street, and gave his check to a small boy at the
door.
At a recent meeting of Melb. Board of
Works, a warlike member named Cody rose to
“ draw attention to the unsettled state of Europe.”
He proposed that all the men who dig out dirt
for the Board should be incorporated into a regi-
ment with EitzGibbon as “general,” and the
Board as officers, but the unsympathetic sewerage
men weren’t on. Probably they thought that two
or three hundred corporation laborers shaking a
futile mud-shovel at Germany, and F. Gibbon
blowing a military poem in the van, would leave
the state of Europe about as unsettled as it was
before.
In ’B6 Parkes opposed the Parliamentary
grant of .£lO,OOO to old Jack Robertson, on the
ground that it would establish a dangerous pre-
cedent :
I am anxious that this Parliament in this young country
should go on free—entirely free—from public grants to
politicians, and from pensions to politicians. If men
come here let them take the consequences. If they
neglect their own affairs let them pay the penalty ; but
do not reward them by grants of public money or by
pensions from the public revenue. And our institutions
will he safer, purer and more elevated, and more a pattern
to surrounding colonies, the more we steer clear of any
touching of public money for such purposes as these. I
am extremely pained, as I have said several times, at
having to utter these sentiments, but I feel I stand upon a
rock in giving utterance to them.
The tricky old man thought he was standing on a
rock, but he was really standing on a snag. As
The Bulletin has often remarked, there is
nothing under Heaven which Parkes ever advo-
cated that he did not previously or subsequently
oppose—and vice-versa.

REPORT.
In order to make full provision, not only for the fall in the present value of securities, but for other
contingent losses which may arise, the directors have transferred .£45,000 from the reserve fund to a
contingent account. A thorough and careful examination leads the directors to believe that the
amount so transferred will be sufficient, and as there is a sum of about =012,000 commission on corpus
m estates (<£480,000) not yet dealt with in addition to the amount carried forward, not only may the
idea of a call be dismissed, but there is every reason to believe that, with business continuing as at
present, dividends may be resumed at the end of the current half-year.

All Ladies’ Complaints treated with great success.
The point reserved for argument in the
® a^our case is as to whether the evidence on
which he got convicted “ was sufficient to warrant
s ® n dmg the case to a jury.” What a mad wag
the Law can be when it likes 1 Nobody denies
that the evidence was sufficient to warrant a
sentence of 14 years’ hard labor for Jabez, but the
Law is solemnly asking itself whether this red-hot
person ought to have been committed for trial.
In the case q! a certain big Australian company-
promoter, the judge said it was quite right to
commit him for trial, although it would have been
wrong to convict him of felony. Jabez, maybe,
was properly convicted when he didn’t legally
deserve to be tried at all. In the case of
Matthew Davies, The Bulletin remembers
that, although the judge said there was
enough evidence to justify a committal,
Pan ton, P.M., had previously refused to sign a
warrant for the ex-Speaker’s prosecution. The
only official notice taken of Panton’s grave error
was the order of C.M.G. conferred upon him at
the request of the late Premier Patterson, or
somebody.
Editor Bulletin. —Your recent article on
Queensland politics omitted Hamlet — i.e., the two
politico-social forces which have of late years
attained a widespread and sinister influence in the
North. I refer to Freemasonry and It. G.-ism.
These two great powers are worked for all they
are worth in Q’sland, but more especially are their
evil influences felt in the various branches of the
Civil Service. Unless you are a “child ”of either
party your chances of promotion are “ Buckley’s.”
Scores of cases have occurred within the last three
years to illustrate my statement. Within the last
twelve months several have been so glaring that
the feeble press of this unfortunate land has
remarked upon the inequality of the ‘ * justice ”
meted out. Recently a high C.S. of “ the right
color ” was found guilty his own confession of a
system of petty peculation extending over several
years, and it was his second proved offence.
Sacked and imprisoned? No fear. The thing
was hushed up, and, only after the matter had
been exposed many months later, the offender was
transferred to a similar position elsewhere. Just
after this another C.S. with an unblemished
record of 23 years was detected in a breach of
trust, but he hadn’t the luck to belong to either
crowd, so he was promptly haled before the local
P.M., fined =£so, and immediately sacked. A man
in one of the other offices was, for unbecoming
conduct, recommended by his responsible head for
transfer from Brisbane to the sultry north, but,
lucky dog! he went to chapel regularly and
was, moreover, going to marry a relative of his
reverence. At the last minute, notwithstanding
his superior’s protest, the transfer was cancelled.
Another applied for six weeks’, leave of absence
(to contest a law-suit) and was advised it could
not be granted. Next day he applied personally
to his ministerial chief (his junior in the Lodge)
and in 24 hours the applicant was away. Another
one, absent on a medical certificate, was stated in
the Assembly (without coi tradiction) to have been
carted out of a country town suffering from
d.t’s. The Govt, burked discussion on the matter
and it was quietly dropped out of sight, as he
belonged to the right crowd. Columns could be
filled with similar instances, but sufficient has
been shown. These matters stink in the nostrils
of those who ask for a fair deal. Those who are
not “ one of us ” have a poor consolation in watch-
ing the wire-pulling when men on each side are
nominated for a vacancy or promotion—a case
then of “pull devil, pull baker.’ Until the pre-
sent political gang is fired out of office there is
little hope for a straight-goer.—N.Q.

“ The morphia and cocaine habits are
largely on the increase in Australia and constitute
a most serious danger. The less we accustom
patients to the use of the hypodermic syringe the
better. For this reason I would urge the use of
ethyl chloride [which needs no syringe], where
possible, in place of cocaine.” — Dr. Daish, at

IMPORTANT NOTICE TO CIGARETTE SMOKERS.
WE Keg to inform our customers and cigarette smokers generally that the American Tobacco Co.,
Ltd., of N.S.W., who control the sale of cigarettes known under the brands of “Allen and
Ginter’s Straight-cut No. 1,” “Cameo” and “ Old Judge,” and who manufacture the colonial-made
cigarettes called “ Pure Gold ” and “ Dixon’s No. I,’’ have given us official notice that they will not
supply us with any of their American-made cigarettes unless we agree to relinquish the agency held by
us for New South Wales for the world-renowned English firm of W. D. and H. 0. WILLS, Limited,
the manufacturers of those popular high-class cigarettes known as
“ TZHZjRZEIE CASTLES” and “ CAPSTAIsr.”
We have declined to conform with this request, as we feel it would not be to the nterest of
cigarette smokers in New South Wales to allow the American Tobacco Co.. Limited, to monopolise
the whole of the cigarette trade. We, therefore, appeal to cigarette smokers to try the celebrated
Wills’ “Three Castles’’ and “Capstan’’ Ciyarettes,
And compare their quality with that of any other. We are confident that their verdict will be in
favor of the
“Three Castles” and “ Capstan.” Cigarettes,
And by smoking these they will prevent any one Company from attempting to dictate what people
should or should not smoke.

Three Cups of Tea.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We tumbled across him in the nor’-west
comer of N.S. Wales. He was not what you
might call a rouseabout. He seemed a decent
sort of fellow, and his name was Good ; but lie
astonished us when he said he didn’t like tea.
“Not like tea ?” spluttered old Packer. “ You’re
not fool enough to drink the soup they call water
here ? ”
“Sometimes I boil it,” replied Good. “ Some-
times, if it’s extra-smelly, T boil it and put wood-
ashes in it; then I strain it through a handker-
chief.”
“ Well,” said Jim Bride, enigmatically, “wot
doesn’t fatten fills. If I’d strained some of the
post-and-rail tea I’ve seen there wouldn’t be much
left to drink. ”
A CCIDEN TAL.
MISS LEAD : “Did you hear that last report?”
MISS FITT: “ From where?”
MISS LEAD: “ Poor young Drinker didn't know he was loaded, and went off
and killed himself.”
One evening, when a common danger drew all
our party together in human friendliness and time
weighed leaden hours, Good told us why he didn’t
drink tea.
* * * *
“I had as good a claim on Flying Pig Ilill
as a man wants, and though I lived pretty freely I
managed to put by a few notes. I reckoned to
buy a farm down in Gippsland and take things
easy. I lived in a hut right on my claim ; but I
boarded at old Ching Foo’s, because I hated cook-
ing for myself.
“ Old Ching Foo kept a straight enough house,
and he treated me real well. He would yarn away
sometimes as if I was a relative of his, and once
or twice he gave me a nip of the best brandy I
ever tasted.
‘ ‘ One night when I’d had a glass or two and was
a bit excited like because the claim was doing so
well, Ching Foo said to me, ‘You come along my
house; I got
something I
show. You
not tell any
other fellow;
I say when
ffo.’
“It was
dark when we
started, but
Ching Foo
seemed to
know the road
all right, and
I followed him.
I don’t know
which way we
went, but we
didn’t walk
more than a
mile when we
struck a house,
and Ching Foo
took me in.
He put me
down in a
snug chair in
a room where
one o r two
lights burned
softly, and
there was a
curious tea-ey
smell. Ching
Foo left me;
then the lights
wentup gradu-
ally, and in
came Ching
Foo again, but
he was dressed
di ff erent 1 y.
He had on a
blue, shiny
coat and loose
white pants,
and his pigtail
hung down
like a rope.
“We walked
into anoih :r
room, and
there we had
dinner. Not
a boarding-
house feed ;
but curried
fowl, all sorts of vegetables, and such pud-
dings as I’d never tasted before. After dinner
we had cigars; and then a young woman—a little,
slim creature with a veil over her face—brought
in some tea, and I drank it. Now, that was tea.
The smell of it seemed to send one into a kind of
dream, and the taste of it made the dream as nice
as a dream could be. I saw old Ching Foo smil-
ing away ; then he handed me the box of cigars
and said: ‘You smoke these; velly good. I
smoke pipe ’—and I knew by the old fellow’s face
that he was going to take his opium.
“ I was in a most inexpressibly comfortable mood
—perhaps the whisky I’d had in the afternoon
might have softened me a bit, but it was that tea
that seemed to set me off. The girl re-entered
with another cup. She came close against me,
and there seemed to be a sort of magnetism in her.
When she took the saucer she seemed to touch my
knee, and I declare that touch made me feel as if
I’d known her all my life and had been in love
with her since I could remember. She was
dressed in something thin and soft; something
that showed her rounded shoulders and bust.
Lord, the very sight of her was enough to make a
fellow feel drunk ! She thought I’d finished my
tea, and stooped over me to take the cup ; and
then—l swear I couldn’t help it—l slid the cup to
the floor and put my arms round her. She didn’t
draw back ; she seemed to think that I’d a right
to do it. She snuggled softly against me ; then
she somehow dropped her veil and I saw her face.
It was such a face as I’d never seen before, and I
suppose I shall never see again. It was white as
milk, and small, and her eyes were beautiful as—
as ; and they looked into mine, and I
stooped down and kissed her. She whispered
‘Are you afraid of Ching Foo?’ and I laughed
low. As if I’d be afraid of anybody then !
“ ‘Afraid of him ! ’ said I.
“ ‘0 hush,’ she said, ‘Be quiet, or he will come.’
“ I kept quiet, for I had my arms around her, and
I didn’t want to move ever again. The whole
thing seemed like a dream, but I knew it was real.
Such a dainty little figure, and her skin as soft
and white as a flower.
“ There was a slight sound, and in a moment she
was out of my arms and had disappeared.
“ Ching Foo came in, and we had a yarn. I told
him what the claim was yielding, and pretty well
all the best side of my affairs ; and he just nodded
his head.
“ Three nights after that Ching Foo asked me to
go home with him again, and I jumped at the
chance. It was just the same as before. The
room with the lights—the same sort of dinner, the
wonderful cup of tea, then Ching Foo took his
opium—then the girl coming in again. She ard I
drank the tea together. She sat by my side as
close as close could be. I kissed her soft, little
mouth and her hair—l could have kept on kissing
her all my life, and wanted nothing better to do.
We didn’t talk much, but she asked me my name,
and she got me to write it down on a bit of paper,
and when I wrote it she kissed me and slipped
away. Then Ching Foo came in.
“ I fished for another invitation, but old Ching
Foo didn’t savee my hints until one day he asked
me to lend him =£lo, and said he’d give me
security on a section of land he owned, and as he
couldn’t write he got Tom Abner and J erry Brash
to witness his mark.* As he signed it, he whis-
pered, ‘ You satisfy take tea alonga me, to-night? ’
and I said, ‘You bet I’m satisfied, and devilish
glad to get it.’
“ Old Ching Foo said, low-like, to me, ‘ You
sign paper, too.’ I was going to tell him that
there was no occasion for me to sign, but h(
seemed to know what was in my mind, and looked
sulky, so I, thinking of the chance of seeing that
girl, signed just to please him, and he laughed like
a happy boy.
It came again—room, dinner, cigars, the cup of
tea, and and my girl. She seemed to come
straight to my arms, and I held her fast.
‘ ‘ I drank the cup of tea at a gulp when I found
she would not share it. It tasted a bit strong,
being a trifle bitter. I wonder how I remember
this, for I had her in my arms before the cup was
well out of my hands. Her dark hair was loosened
and hung down in long wavy lines ; her veil lay
on the floor. I looked into her eyes, she looked
into mine ; then her lips seemed to come to mine,
her arms went round my neck Poof !
folks may talk about opium and that stuff; but
that girl was real. Could I remember it all so
well after so many years ? No, I held her, and I
don’t want heaven to be any better than that;
and it lasted—was it an hour or a second ?
“ When I came to myself I was in a stinking
little hovel that some Chinese gardeners used to
own, and when Tom Abner saw me he said,
‘ Well, I’m blamed ! Why, it’s town-talk that
you had bought Ching Foo’s section and had gone
down to Melbourne to float a big thing in mines.’
“ When I went to the township I found that
Ching Foo had presented a cheque signed by me
at the bank, and had drawn out all my money.
Tom Abner and Jerry Brash had seen me sign the
transfer, and had heard me say that it was all
right, and that I was satisfied.
♦ » * *
‘ ‘Well, and I was satisfied. Ching may have
got at me badly ; but I’d pay twice as much—aye,
a hundred times as much if I had it for another
meeting wit.li that girl.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Who are these strange small folk
That come into our homes as kings,
Asking nor leave nor grace,
Bending our necks to their yoke,
Taking the highest place,
And mastery of all things ?
Whence they come none may know,
But a wondrous land it must be ;
Angels in exile they
Seem in this dull world below ;
Creatures of sinful clay
We feel near their purity.
Clearer their young eyes are
Than the dew in the cups of flow’rs
Gleaming, when shines at dawn
Faintly, the morning’s one star—
Eyes whose still gaze, indrawn,
Sees things unseen by ours.
Deep in those orbs serene —
Little planets be-ringed and bright—
Mysteries marvellous lie :
Known unto us they might mean
Faith, without fear, to die,
All sure of the waiting light.
Dimpled their hands and small—
Would ye, therefore, their might contemn
Seem they for play designed ?
Fate, and the Future withal,
Weal, yea and Woe, of Mankind,
Lie hid in the palms of them.
Tyrants, whose terrible names
Make men pale, with delight intense,
Worshipping, kiss their feet ;
Touch of their little hands tames
Fiercest of hearts that beat—
So mighty is Innocence.
These are the children dear,
From a country unknown of cliait.
(Dim Land of Souls Unborn),
Rosy as morn they come here,
Filling with joy forlorn
Waste places in our hearts.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The shed has cut out. The “ Birds o’ Freedom ”
(Maorilanders) have “took their break.” The
rest of us have been in town nearly three hours.
I sit under the lee of the empty beer-barrel on
the pub. verandah. It is ten minutes to four.
“ Frenchy ” stands on the door-step with a three-
inch scalp-wound on his head—caused casually.
He shoos the flies off as he mutters : “Trafalgar
must be r-revenge ! Waterloo must be r-revenge !”
The old boundary-rider is out in the middle of the
road, attired in pants, leggings, and grey hair.
“ Come out here, you blanky German blank!” he.
shouts.
Two or three others wander aimlessly about in
a more or less happy condition —rather more than
less. The old chap who was penning up is stroll-
ing about calling all and sundry blanky blanks
and reciting bits of Shakespeare.
Four o’clock. A dog-fight starts. Someone
kicks the old man’s dog. He breaks off in his re-
citative. “Here! the blanky blank who kicks
my blanky dog kicks me !”
Four-five. The boundary-rider and Frenchy
are out in the road clutching spasmodically at
each other. They fall. The blood from Frenchy’s
head runs into the boundary - rider’s mouth.
Curses, blood, dust, and joy. A long man with a
dog tries to pull them apart; fails ; gets annoyed.
“ Here ! you’re both blanky blanks. I’ll fight
the blanky pair of you !”
“ Oh, if I were an orator as Brutus is !” spouts
the old chap. Little Snapper: “Blank you and
Brutus, too ! you’re a blanky liar ! ” [Short en-
counter.]
4.20. The boundary-rider’s horses break away
from rail; five or six try to catch them and fall
over one another in the attempt. Pandemonium
broken loose! General atmosphere of oaths,
broken English, ditto faces, dog-fighting, dust-
flying. . . . .
4.40. Everybody singing ; general hilarity.
I fall asleep behind the beer-barrel, lulled by the
sweet sounds, and remember no more.
Q.
P. R.
Dear Bulletin, —Re Prof. Morris’ dis-
cussion of the origin of Australian words, it
often strikes me, while listening-to the mopoke —or
morepork, or mopork, or morepoke, or mopehawk,
or whatever his name may be—that a name, more
than any appropriate with reference both to the
sound of its call, and the time, as well as in asso-
ciation with Marcus Clarke’s interpretation of
Australia’s dominant note, would be—“ No hope!”
In moments of mental depression this bird’s call
has had a weird suggestiveness to me. If Poe had
heard the bird, “ the raven ” would hardly have
been written in its present form.— Danton.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Whether it was that she was physically the least
unattractive woman in the small island community
or whether Marden really found in her that
communion of soul—which sex-novelists claim as
essential to a joyous existence--is, after all, of
little moment. But the fact was indisputable
that Mrs. Gorlier—or “ Gorlier’s old woman, as
the unsophisticated islanders termed her—claimed
far more of his time and attention than is usually
devoted by bachelors to married acquaintances of
the opposite sex—and that his attentions were
appreciated.
Gorlier himself
—a weak-eyed in-
dividual with an
irresolute hand
for ever fingering
an undecided lip
—tacitly ac-
quiesced in the
position, and
threw his hospit-
able door open
every evening.
Then, his guest
comfortably en-
sconced in the
parlor, he would
consider his du-
ties as host ended,
and would sham-
ble off down the
little worn track
in the direction
of the Travellers’
Arms, to be seen
no more before
day-break.
An enforced
business trip to
the mainland
caused a tempor-
ary break in these
friendly rela-
tions, but the
evening of Mar-
den’s return saw
him sauntering
up to the friendly
h miestead the
door of which
was, as usual,
opened by the
host himself.
Gorlier looked
even feebler and
more undecided
than usual.
“ Evening,”
s fid the guest,
with an air of
cheerful patronage (for it was impossible to respect
Gorlier), “ Wife in, I suppose?”
Gorlier’s indecision deepened into something
like confusion. “Yes—she’s in—oh, yes —she’s in,
but ”
“But what, old man?” queried Marden sharply,
for, you see, he had been absent from the friendly
parlor for nearly a week, and the night air was
beginning to strike chilly.
Gorlier paused, and then raised his hand to his
lip with the old irresolute attitude.
“She’s gone,” he said, “she’s passed away.
My right hand has been taken from me.”
Marden staggered back as if he had been struck.
“Not dead, my God; not dead ! ” he whispered.
“Yes,” said Gorlier, simply. “But come in-
come in, you know the way almost as well as
I do.”
Marden, suppressing his emotion, eyed him
keenly for a moment. The remark savored of irony,
but Gorlier was obviously innocent of suoh mental
effort.
“ She always took to you, Marden,” he went on,
“she’s inside there” (indicating the adjacent
room). “Perhaps you’d like to see her. They
are just laying her out.”
Marden made a hurried motion of dissent.
“No! Well, p’raps not —p’raps not. You’ll
take the old chair. She—l mean, I —won’t be
long.”
He was already at the door, but paused. “ Oh,
maybe you have the price of a glass of beer about
you? This watching—thanks, a bob will do nicely.”
Marden waited until his footsteps had died
away, and then sank into a chair. A strange
sound in the next room riveted his attention,
and, with nervous intensity, he found himself lis-
tening to the hushed footsteps of the friendly
neighbors, who were performing the last offices to
the woman whose society had been so much to
him.
Meanwhile, down the beaten track shambled
the bereaved husband, mentally calculating the
amount of liquid enjoyment that lay before him.
With these anticipations were mingled regrets—
keen regrets—that, distraught by the painful
memories of his recent loss, he should have
stooped to borrow a shilling from Marden—when
he might just as easily have asked for and ob-
tained two. the Laird.
This brief year’s events demonstrate the
wisdom of a step taken by the U. 5.28 years ago,
in buying Alaska for a song, from Russia, which
would not let England have it for untold gold.
Bananas are now being grown at Horsham
(Vic.) with success. One tree in the local

The blood of animals which have been

an apron, made from the hair of his mother-in-law,
out off her on his wedding-day.
Mrs. Fry was once summoned to pray with
a moribund Norfolk squire. He said “Thanks,
Ma’am, but would you kindly wait till these have
done.” Two cocks were fighting at the other side
of the bed.
A recent Sydney E. News story has it
that, when a man in the bush picks his tobacco
with his fingernails, “ it’s an infallible sign that
he has served a long term of imprisonment ”—in-
stead of merely being an infallible sign that he
hasn’t got a knife.
When the Ghiniquy riots occurred at
Hobart, one of the special constables sworn in was
an Irish dentist. Sez he, as one day he walked
the streets with another special, truncheon in
hand, “Look here, old man, don’t spare the
ruffians ! Just you knock their teeth down their
throats ! ” Two birds with one stone.
Reform is urgently demanded in connec-
tion with the N.S.W. detective force. The sala-
ries at present paid are utterly and ludicrously
insufficient. If the men are to do their work pro-
perly, they must run a big bill for travelling and
like expenses, which the Govt, should foot. It
obviously follows that the capable officer, who
pays his own expenses out of his small salary,
must have other sources of income, into which
close inquiry cannot be made. Hence, salaries
should be increased, and allowance made for
money out of pocket. It is also probable that no
more detectives will be recruited from the regular
police, as by the time Robert gets to the detective
office the criminal population are familiar with his
homely countenance.
