Your 1935 Queensland
Advertising Campaign!
Queensland is a vast State to cover, with many minor publications
dotted over its length and breadth; but there are two outstanding
advertising mediums upon which you can base your 1935
campaign with certainty of success.
THE COURIER-MAIL
62,617 Copies Daily
(A.B.C. Certificate for 6 months to Sept. 30, 1934.)
Queensland’s outstanding daily newspaper with, by far, the largest
circulation of any newspaper published in the State.
THE SUNDAY MAIL
47,205 Copies Per Issue
(A.B.C. Certificate for 6 months ended Sept. 30, 1934.)
Companion Journal to the Courier-Mail, and showing a more pheno-
menal increase in circulation than any newsjiaper in Australia. A
comparison of the monthly net averages from April to September with
Its previous A.B.C. Certificate of 40,342 copies per issue should prove
to national advertisers that it is worthy of inclusion in any campaign:
NET AVERAGE CIRCULATION PER ISSUE.
April 42,780 July 47,682
May 44,091 August 49,646
June 47,530 September 51,501
September’s figure of 31,501 is 27 per cent, greater than the average

GRAVES’S FINE
NEW WORK
In I, Claudius
Robert Graves
wrote of the
fourth Caesar
from his birth in 10 b.c. to his forcible
elevation to the purple 51 years later.
The grandson of Augustus was presented
as an intellectual (which he must have
been), and as the possessor of humani-
tarian instincts which would do credit to
a member of the R.S.P.C.A. It was
original of Mr. Graves to depict a mem-
ber of the Imperial family as kind, for-
giving and devoid of ambition ; and it
was safe. We know practically nothing
of Claudius’s unofficial life.
Now comes Claudius the God (Barker ;
10s. 6d.). It takes up the story at the
murder of Caligula, and shows, with a
wealth of literary skill and knowledge of
Tacitus, Seneca, the Scriptures and
human nature, how absolute power
changed a timid, studious, domesticated
invalid into a human tiger.
Was Claudius different from his pre-
decessors at any stage of his career?
Probably not. His first action as Emperor
was to have Cassius Chaerea —the hero of
the German campaigns, the stoutest
patriot in Rome —executed for ridding
the empire of Caligula. The taste for
blood grew till at last we find him stag-
ing the sham fight on the Fucine Lake.
By nightfall
Three thousand men had been killed or
drowned. When I was a lad I couldn’t
bear the sight of bloodshed. I don’t mind
it at all now J I get so interested in the
fighting.
Inevitably the story is largely that of
the Emperor’s cousin Messalina, whom
he had married shortly before his acces-
sion, and his niece Agrippina, whom he
married after Messalina’s murder, and
who had him poisoned. Mr. Graves suc-
ceeds in bringing these classic symbols
of depravity to life. However, he
doesn’t seem to be greatly interested in
them, and their repetitive infamies weary
the reader after a while. They lack light
and shade.
The character whom he likes best and
sees most clearly is Herod Agrippa.
About 60 brilliant pages are devoted to
Herod at the beginning, and glowing
portraits emerge of this witty, subtle and
unscrupulous Asiatic and his devoted
wife Cypros. Herod keeps appearing—
always amusing or dramatic, and always
in character—till his ghastly death at
Caesarea, which is vividly described.
Another feature is a masterly analysis
of the British campaign which enabled
Claudius to throw off the inferiority
complex engendered by the haunting
knowledge that, unlike his brother Ger-
manicus (father of Agrippina), he had
not commanded troops in the field. From
now on the last
traces of that whim-
sical humility which
was the keynote of
I, Claudius vanish.
So much so that
when the British
barbarians make a
god of him he takes
it seriously. But by
now he is on a
steep down-grade
mentally, as well
as spiritually and
physically. His
a c h i evements : —the
mighty buildings, the
engineering works,
the wise laws which
have caused him to
be compared to
Augustus—are be-
hind him, and he is
looking forward to
death.
Claudius the God is a rare work: it
keeps close enough to the known facts to
be helpful to students of the period, and
it is as exciting as fiction.
Robert Graves.
J.D.
Do the
Popular
Try to Be?
If “Tauwarra”
implies (R.P.
21/11/’34) that
popular novelists
are popular be-
cause they deli-
berately try to. be popular, I disagree
utterly. Best-sellers are born, not made;
a Warwick Deeping pausing to ask
whether he will be a Deeping or a Law-
rence seems to me exceedingly funny.
The secret of the best-seller is hardly
a secret at all; his trick consists in play-
ing on the stock responses of the mob,
on evoking their stock attitudes; and
he is able to do it because his mind is
typical of the mob mind, shares its atti-
tudes, responds to the same stimuli, lives
at the same intellectual and emotional
levels. His attitudes are merely a little
more defined and urgent and alive; he
is articulate: he can express the popular
sentiment, evoke the popular responses.
In an age when the popular mind is
intelligent and alert and sensitive, the
intelligent, alert and sensitive writer will
be popular: in an age when the popular
mind is overwhelmed by superstitions,
shibboleths, gross platitudes and fifth-
hand ideas, the artists will be unpopular
and book societies will flourish.
Fundamentally, the best-seller of to-
day is as subject to the same mental in-
anities as are the people at large. He
deals in platitudes, in staled situations
and characters and moods and notions,
because the popular mind is no longer
alert and eager and independent; be-
cause it can make no new efforts, but
likes to deal in the familiar change.
If one makes a careful study of best-
sellers at any one period of recent his-
tory, one will find
that they use a com-
mon stock, easy
counters which save
them the trouble of
fresh invention (if
they are capable of
invention), and
which have imme-
diately a known
price in. the popular
mind, a price estab-
lished by long and
familiar use. Cer-
tain stock ideas,
emotions, situations
are standardised,
and the public loves
the same old cards
just sufficiently
shuffled to give a
mild novelty to the
new hand. The popu-
lar novelist excels
at such shuffling,
whereas the artist wants to teach the
public a new game, to extend and en-
large its experience. But the artist de-
mands mental effort: in this age of easy
entertainment, of cinemas and radio, his,
demand is fatal to his popularity.
One may instance obvious and simple
examples of the stock by reference to
Biilldog Drummond. Drummond is big
and fit and ugly (heroes in popular fic-
tion frequently have an honest, rugged
ugliness: on the films the fashion has
changed, but then you have to look at
people on the films). Drummond also
likes lots of beer, and that rouses a sym-
pathetic response in most of us (the Eng-
glish generally trust a man who is fond
of his beer and his ; pipe. Witness the
clever use which political propagandists
have made of Baldwin’s pipe and beer.
How many villains in repent popular
fiction smoke pipes?). Yet notice that, in
spite of his beer, Drummond remains
fit and unflabby ; his beer doesn’t hurt
him: a concession to temperance advo-
cates in the suggestion that it might, and
at the same time evoking our admiration
for the man who can hold his liquor.
Notice, too, how “Sapper” and so
many others evoke our stock (and proper)
admiration for the man who served in
the army (the early paragraphs of Temple
Tower are a fascinating study); how the
public-school complex is made to contri-
bute : how the key-words to our stock
attitudes are repeated again and again
(“good condition,” “fit,” “trained to the
last ounce,” “ale,” “front line,” etc.).
Drummond is a pukka sahib: all the
memories and associations which attach
to our previous literary experience of
pukka sahibs rush to help “Sapper” as he
taps, the appropriate keys: Drummond
acquires the admiration. and affection
which our ingenious mind has previously
developed for his like: we have no new
experience, we merely relive the old ones.
We may even persuade ourselves that a
character is like life when we really mean
that he is like characters we have met
in other books*: for nowadays most of us
acquire our ideas more from cinema and
fiction and radio than from immediate
contact with life.
Blue eyes may be peculiar to innocence
only in the cheaper fiction ; curled black
moustaches may be somewhat out of date
as a positive symptQm of villainy ; but
these devices are replaced by others, and
the technique of the Priestleys, Deepings,
Baums is essentially the same, though
somewhat more subtle and sophisticated.
Now the job of the genuine artist is
exactly the reverse of this: the genuine
artist deals in original ideas: he shocks
our preconceptions rather than flatters
and feeds them. His notions are not our
notions until we have read and mastered
them ; he is (under modern conditions,
though not in a healthy society) in reac-
tion against the mass, striking new sparks
for new flames. One can almost test
the artist’s proper power by the degree
to which an intelligent reader finds his
mental order challenged, by the degree
in which we are compelled to test, try
and possibly modify our mental outlook,
our view of life. To suggest that at
any one time in his course an artist cap-
able of new and stimulating thought may
choose to adopt old and outworn notions,
cold-bloodedly and with the deliberate
intention of exploiting the public taste,
is to deny the thing that the artist is.
No man has become a best-seller by
trying to become a best-seller; best-sellers
have again and again revealed the com-
mon clay which is their being (one uses
“best-seller” in a specialised sense, of
course, not to refer to every novelist
whose books have sold well, but to those
whose books have sold well in the
absence of considerable literary merit),
and their immunity from original intelli-
gent thought. No proper artist could
have mistaken the quality of his work
as Marie Corelli mistook the quality of

hers. Frankau appeals to the mob be-
cause his ideas and emotions are as crude
and ponderous as theirs. The very title
of The Good Companions (it has been
adopted by dozens of clubs) illustrates
Priestley’s mastery of mob sentimen-
talism.
These are popular entertainers, not
artists: they are popular entertainers in
the sense that Mo and George Robey are
popular entertainers: they evoke in their
public those feelings which the public
likes to have evoked. (Their trade is, to
my mind, a legitimate one, provided it
is not mistaken for what it is not and
provided that the public is not deluded
by specious ideas and shoddy sentiment
and sensibilities.)
The artist, on the other hand, evokes
the thoughts and emotions which enlarge
and test our experience, rather than
smoothly confirm and flatter it. The
best-seller does not try to please his pub-
lic ; the effort would be fatal. He pleases
it because he shares the popular atti-
tudes, Sir Philip Gibbs, for example, has
said:
I never think of my public when I am
writing a novel, nor do I modify my views
or style to please those whom I imagine
to be my readers. I just try to tell my
story and get as much truth into it as
happens to be in my own mind and mood.
He is articulate ; but his mind and mood
reflect the mind and mood of the mass:
in his work they see their own views
ordered and represented. Hence the
97,000 purchasers of The Middle of the
Road.
Here is the attitude of P. C. Wren,
writer of adventure stories for the con-
temporary adult:
The bulk of my readers are the cleanly-
minded, virile, outdoor sort of people of
both sexes, and the books are widely read
in the army, the navy, the universities, the
public schools and the clubs.
One observes the associated epithets:
it gives one a pretty clear idea of the
worth of Major Wren’s judgment on life
and letters.
Consider this passage from The Life
of Florence L. Barclay, written by a
daughter: -
She was out to supply her fellow-men
with joy, refreshment, inspiration. She
was not out to make art for art’s sake, or
to perform a literary tour de force. The
busy men and women who form the major-
ity of the reading public, and who read
fiction by way of relaxation and enjoyment,
do not desire to have productions of literary
“art” supplied to them, that their criti-
cal faculties may be exercised and their
minds educated to a precise valuation of
dramatic form, powerful realism,, high
tragedy. They ask merely to be pleased,
rested, interested, amused, inspired to a
more living faith in the beauty of human
atfection and the goodness of God.
If one omits the last phrase, the judg-
ment stands for the contemporary reader.
He is seeking to be amused and to live
vicariously; the modern flood of sex
novels is prompted by the erotic but un-
fulfilled ambitions of the average subur-
banite ; Michael Arlen caters for a
changed sentiment, but Mrs. Barclay and
he have the same essential purpose.
The authors cited by “Tauwarra” have
little bearing on the real issue. Neither
Dickens nor Trollope is a great artist,
though they have many of the merits of
great artists. The outstanding quality
of both is their readability, and read-
ability (in the cheaper sense) is a quality
pertaining to the judgment of a public
amuser rather than to an artist. In both
of them, however, the artist was present;
they lived in an age when art was still
compatible in some measure (not to the
measure of the eighteenth, seventeenth
or sixteenth century) with popularity.
The reading public had not suffered the
full effects of mass-production of minds
(universal “education,” radio, cinema,
Northcliffe, Newnes were still in the
future); it retained a comparatively high
level of appreciation, and was still alert
for originality of thought and opinion.
Neither Dickens nor Trollope was
especially original in his thought and
opinions and attitudes, but they were
vastly superior to the Walpoles of our day.
If one reads Dickens beside Priestley
(the comparison has been made, extra-
ordinary to relate) one realises at once
the decline in the public’s standards of
values. Dickens was what he was, and
Priestley is what he is; the public re-
sponse has changed. Dickens’s concern
for what the public would stand is a
normal concern to any author, and it
has little relevance here ; the point is
that Dickens’s public would stand and
could appreciate better work than the
contemporary public. As public taste
declines inferior authors rise.
It is worth insisting again that in spite
of his readability Dickens was not a great
novelist in the sense that Tolstoy and
Dostoevsky are great novelists: he is
more readable perhaps, but one must
not confuse popular appeal with great-
ness of mind and spirit. Dostoevsky,
living in misery and want and yet faith-
ful to his vision of life, moved by a
noble and large vision of life, is the
true type of the authentic artist: he
could no more have falsified his vision
than Michelangelo could have spent his
life designing the accepted variety of
tombstones for the inhabitants of West
Terrace or Waverley. And a Walpole is
no more capable of The Brothers Karam-
zov than a stonemason is capable of the
David. The nature of the mind may not
be transmuted ; if a genius have the luck
to include elements of popular appeal
in his make-up, that' is, if the age is an
age when the popular mind can respond
to elements in the experience of genius,
so much the happier for the genius and
the populace. But an artist can only
communicate with his people if the
people share in some measure his high
meanings ; the common meanings are the
level of popular art.
If one compares our modern war
memorials with the mediaeval churches,
one begins to understand how low the
common meaning has sunk, how few
contacts there are between an authentic
artist and the modern masses. The artist
to-day has been cut off from the people,
and the division has injured both. On
the one side the popular mind is now
informed by the cheap and commer-
cialised meanings of the cheapened and
commercialised writers and producers ;
on the other side, the artist withdraws
into himself, rejected and rejecting, no
longer attempting to communicate, de-
veloping his private thoughts and even
his private languages for the few who
still care to resort to him.
James Joyce is a symptom of the re-
jection of the artist', and his obscurities
and tortured syntax rise from the em-
bittered loneliness of the artist, deprived
of his true social function. His eccen-
tricities are morbid, but they are symp-
toms of the larger morbidity, of the social
malady: one can see the evil working
through Lawrence, a man with a deep,
passionate and frustrated sense of the
social value of his art. Unless the artist
can be content (as Joyce has tried and
failed, and as Lawrence scorned to try)
with a wholly personal exploration of his
own mind, he must be frustrated in this
age. Yet the loss of the artist to society
is the loss of a vital organ ; a certain
symptom of social degeneration.
Edgar Wallace, the modern mentioned
by “Tauwarra,” is an interesting case,
but one which hardly concerns the artis-
tic function and fate. The suggestion
that Wallace gave up work of serious
value to write for the mob is a curious
one. Wallace’s earlier stories (the
“Bones” series, e.g.) are good magazine
fiction competently produced, using
stock appeals and using them well, but
they are no closer to any comprehensible
literary values than is The Four Just
Men. Wallace was a public entertainer
of exceptional skill and even merit. The
fact that the later books are “thrillers”
has nothing to do with the comparison:
a book is not bad art because it is a
thriller, but because it is untrue to the
writer’s vision or because the vision is
false or inadequate. I can conceive a
thriller which would be great art: there
is a real sense in which Crime and Pun-
ishment is a thriller. Shakspeare should
have taught us that the convention of
the form does not affect the artistic pos-
sibilities: Edgar Poe’s mystery stories
are artistic in a sense which is denied to
many much boomed contemporary
writers (boomed by a coterie of novelist-
critics who engage in profitable admira-
tion of one another). Ronald Knox’s de-
tective stories and books like Trent’s
Last Case are far more serious works
than most of Priestley’s unreal stuff;
The Mystery of Edwin Drood has more
of the meat of life than any selection of
the Book Society. Over and above his
popular appeal, Edgar Wallace did have,
as a matter of fact, qualities which have
not been sufficiently recognised. There
was a streak of the artist in Wallace,
though hardly sufficient to compromise
his popularity. Most of his novels were
shoddy and hastily written, but they have
a verisimilitude at times which is foreign
to many men of more boosted repute,
He did succeed in reproducing aspects
of London life and of police work (which
is, after all, a phase of life) with fidelity
and effect. His plays have obvious
dramatic quality arising out of human
and credible conflict. He had, too, the
virtue of knowing his limitations and of
refusing to mistake them. He knew what
he could do and he did it. Perhaps that
is why his books, which are primarily
entertainments, at times have a hint of
something better than mere entertain-
ment. But though one sees and says this,
one does not imagine that Wallace
could have turned from his public to
write a Madame Bovary. He was not a
Flaubert, but he was an honest man: it
was his good luck that he could do what
was compatible with the public taste of
his time: just as it is D. B. Wyndham
Lewis’s bad luck to live in this time and
not in Swift’s.
My quotations are extracted from Mrs.
Q. D. Leavis’s Fiction and the Reading
Public. It is a severe and austere work,
and many of its attitudes are intolerable
to one unshaped by the Cambridge
school: but it has a wealth of sound
thinking and real criticism. I recom-
mend it to “Tauwarra,” and indeed to
all those survivors who still think honest
standards and values worth defence.

wick gets athwart the No. 1 vil-

of a local master pearler. Conse-

work, from which the hero and his

SUBSIDISED SHIPPING.
The Commonwealth Government has let
1934 go by without dealing with the
question of foreign subsidised shipping.
It has been dilly-dallying since the
Ottawa Conference.
It was proposed that after Ottawa an
Empire committee should meet to recom-
mend a policy; but there has been no such
meeting, though the London Economic
Conference had a discussion in which the
British and Scandinavian delegates spoke
against subsidies. Later the British Gov-
ernment agreed to contribute to the cost
of the Cunarder building on the Clyde,
conditionally on the amalgamation of the
two great trans-Atlantic lines. Ameri-
can shareholders in one of these con-
cerns tried to get an injunction which
would have prevented the completion of
the job.
Trans-Pacific British shipping has suf-
fered heavily in competition with U.S.A.
luxury liners which could not carry on
without lavish support from Uncle Sam,
who in addition reserves the San Fran-
cisco-Honolulu trade for vessels flvine
his flag.
To the end of 1933 the Dollar line,
which operates in the Pacific, had re-
ceived from Washington 4,300,000 dol-
lars more than the cost of its vessels. It
owed the U.S. Treasury 27,000,000 dol-
lars, yet in 10 subsidy years its profits
were 22,188,000 dollars. American ship-
ping people have even tried to have
agents for their subsidised lines debarred
from representing ships not on the
U.S.A. register and not carrying crews
two-thirds American.
While Americans are thus active in
their own interests, the Australian Gov-
ernment has slumbered. In March, 1933,
Mr. Lyons intimated that it was in favor
of a common policy for the protection
of Australian, British and Maoriland
shipping in the Pacific, and had “arranged
to take the matter up with British and
Dominion Governments,” but “circum-
stances’ had “prevented final considera-
tion.” A few weeks later Mr. Latham,
then Attorney-General, told the Repre-
sentatives that “consultations” were
going on with “the British Government.”
By October, 1933, Mr. Stewart was able
to announce that “consultations” were
in progress with “the Maoriland Govern-
ment.” In November the Administra-
tion was still “awaiting replies” from
Maoriland.
Eleven months afterwards Roland
Green, M.H.R., raised the question in
Parliament. He said he had raised it
“on many occasions,” and had “always
. en ,, that it was under considera-
tion.” Mr. Lyons replied that it would
be easy to take action, but that it “could
not be guaranteed that any beneficial
effect would result.” It was essential that
there should be co-operation with the
other Governments concerned, and “only
recently we received an intimation from
Povernment of Maoriland that two
Ministers would visit Australia to
confer.
Several more questions were asked
during the last session, each without re-
sult. Two M.L. Ministers arrived. They
and several Commonwealth Ministers
talked much about oranges and potatoes.
Meantime the Germans took steps to
establish a subsidised line to North Asia
via Rabaul. They were bought out by
Burns Philp. J
The Maoriland Government has not
been asleep. It has amended the Cus-
toms Act to provide that.
If it appears to the Governor that British
snips are subject in any foreign country
to any prohibition or restriction as to the
carrying of passengers or goods coastwise,
ne may subject to treaties —impose similar
restrictions on the ships of the offending
country carrying passengers or goods coast-
wise in M.L. or to any British possession
where an Act similar to the M.L. Act
exists.
The M.L. Government has acquired,
“t ?9.t yet exercised, power to deal with
subsidised shipping or with ships of coun-
tries which show any form of prefer-
ence against British sea transport such
as special customs duties imposed on
goods carried in British ships. It may
act so as to countervail” the foreigners’
advantages. It is evident from this that
Australian delay is holding up Maori-
Jand action as well as giving foreigners
a tree run in the Australian trade.
Australia has a vital interest in the
maintenance and extension of Australian,
British and Maoriland shipping in the
acme. Apart altogether from trade, an
adequate mercantile marine is a neces-
sary adjunct to any defence scheme. It
needed 38 ships, the largest of which
was 13,500 tons, to carry the first
Anzacs to Egypt. If it were necessary
to-day to send a self-contained division
to Northern Australia or New Guinea, it
could not be done in Australian-owned
vessels without almost completely denud-
ing the coast of everything down to
trawlers. In 1924 Australia and Maori-
la"d h * d 615 steam- and motor-ships
ot 757,085 gross tons ; by 1931 (the Com-
monwealth Statistician gives no later
figures) the number of vessels had de-
-593 and the S ross tonnage to
0/7,463.
It is in no unfriendly spirit that Aus-
tralians and Maorilanders demand that
foreign ships competing against Austra-
lian British and Maoriland lines with
the help of subsidies should be treated
as their Governments treat British ship-
ping, subsidised or not. The policy is
necessary to both their countries and
to Britain.
A LEAD FROM JAPAN.
In denouncing the Washington Treaty
Japan, through its Ambassador to the
U.S.A., made a suggestion which has not
received the welcome it deserves.
J a pan is willing to discard half its
"fjfy . r. a - common maximum for the
U.b.A., Britain and Japan is established.
I here should be a new treaty, resting not
upon the ratio principle but upon a formula
ot an agreed common upper limit for arma-
ments to be retained by each Power, so
that it may be difficult for any Power to
attack another but easy to defend itself.
Offensive arms might be totally abolished
or drastically reduced, and defensive arms
adequately provided.
The difference between this scheme and
the universal disarmament proposals put
forward by the U.S.S.R. some years ago
is that it is feasible. Of course, the
Japanese are not offering something for
nothing; they want to develop Man-
chukuo unhampered by British or Ameri-
can interference. And why not? It is
their burden, not that of Europe or
America.
The Japanese proposal is of great in-
terest as the first official recognition by
any Power that the era of Imperial
expansion is over. Nowadays Roman
legionaries would find nobody to levy
upon: only what soldiers call “useless
mouths” and workers already taxed to
the limits of their capacity to pay.
Spanish concjuistadorcs would discover
that practically all the world’s gold had
gravitated into a few impregnable banks
and Treasury vaults. The Japanese sug-
gest, in effect, that the Powers should rest
on their gains. Again, why not? None
of them has anything to hope for from
war, which, in contradiction of all pre-
vious historical rules, is now the pre-
occupation of the nationettes.
Russia would certainly jump at the
chance to disarm consistently with secu-
rity from another invasion. It has never
waged a great war successfully outside
its own borders, and its Government has
generations of work ahead if the re-
sources of the country are to be so much
as tapped.
Britain, the world-trader and monop-
olist of places in the sun, has always
gone to war reluctantly, and it is likely
to do so with more reluctance than ever
now that it has lost command of the
seas. The British would be more than
satisfied with a formula which rendered
the U.K., its colonies and the Dominions
safe from attack.
France, with a falling birth-rate and
a large colonial empire, has no further
Imperial ambitions. The French only
ask to be allowed to hold what thev
have. J
Remains the U.S.A. Japan’s notice of
its intention to denounce the Washington
Treaty coincided with the publication
of details regarding America’s spring
manoeuvres in the Pacific.
a re to be of unparalleled scope,
-177 ships, 477 aeroplanes and the diri-
gible Macon with 55,000 officers and men,
will operate from May 3 to June 6 over
an area extending from the Aleutians to a
group 1000 miles west of Honolulu.
Tt sounds bellicose, but almost cer-
tainly it has more to do with the Roose-
velt plan to increase the popularity of
the navy as an ultimate means of putting
money into circulation and lessening un-
employment than with overseas invasion
plans. America may not like to see its
Monroe Doctrine imitated in Northern
hina, but it is not going to war about it
while its depression problems remain un-
solved.
An international arrangement limiting
the Powers to defensive warships, bases
planes and armies might be the salva-
tion of Australia and Maoriland. The
scheme would not be permanent; no
human institution is. Japan may rise
till it becomes another England. Other
empires may decline and be absorbed by
it. But any kind of halt in the rush for
territorial spoils would be a boon.
Particularly to Australia, which needs no-
thing so much as peace to build up a
population and industries.
“OVERRUN WITH QUACKS.”
„ mterests °f suffering humanity
the Parliaments of all the States would
do well to consider the swan song of C.
S. Crouch, who has just retired from the
secretaryship of the Victorian B.M.A.
many years of service. No longer
JP a servant of the medical profession,
£ roucll * s f f ? e to . say what he likes,
and he says “Victoria is overrun with
quacks.” So are all the States—all over-
run with quacks.
Under Victorian law any unqualified
person may set up as a healer, pretend
to diagnose, prescribe and dispense medi-
cine. It is the same in other States ;
hence the authorities are powerless to
deal with the perpetrators of the cruellest
forms of swindling known. The impostor
who adopts the title of doctor can be
brought to book and fined, but it is hard
to catch him. An accomplice may call
him a doctor and nothing happens ; it
is only when there is absolute proof that
the offender himself has announced him-
self as a doctor that it is possible to
secure a conviction. As for the person
who styles himself, say, a certificated
xylopath, impressing his victims with a
“diploma” from Transylvania or North
Dakota hanging on the wall of his wait-
ing-room, he is beyond reach. He cannot
issue certificates of death ; he can, and
does, cause them to be issued.
For some occult reason many people
have more confidence in the quack than
in the qualified man. A person who
would demand proper qualifications from
a plumber before employing him to fix
the bath will cheerfully place his bodily
welfare or that of a member of
his family in the hands of a prac-
titioner of ferro-therapy or something
of the sort. He has lost faith in
the orthodox medical man, he will
tell you, because the orthodox fail
to tell him what is the matter with him.
The ferro-therapist will look him over,
pronounce it a bad case of buncovitis,
charge him two guineas and send him off
with a bottle of colored water which
contains sufficient crude alcohol to give
him a kick.
In his “San Michele” the Swedish Dr.
Munthe describes how the French police
rounded up all the quacks in Paris. The
man who was making the most money
of all was ordered to produce his license.
To their astonishment, he showed it; he
was a duly-qualified man. “But for God’s
sake, don’t let it get out,” he said to the
police inspector ; “I’d lose my practice.”
Australian cities are the prey of
“herbalists” who buy their herbs with a
list of the ailments they are supposed to
cure printed on the package. Some of
the herbs naturally do their work, and
thenceforward grateful patients trumpet
forth the stories of the cures, until scores
more bring their guineas to the learned
person who bought the medicine and the
prescription ready-made. Others are led
to patronise the herbalist because they
have a fond belief that herbal drugs are
more safe to swallow than mineral drugs.
They are astonished when they are told
that such beverages as strychnine and
belladonna are herbal.
The public needs to be protected from
its own foolishness. If the medical pro-
fession fails in some cases to do what
is expected of it, it has at all events tried
to master the problems it faces. Its
members devote five or six unprofitable
years to learning the rudiments of their
calling. For another four or five years
they continue to increase their store of
knowledge and assimilate what they
already know, while, generally speaking,
earning less than the basic wage. The
quack arises full-fledged, like the Greek
hero from the brain of Minerva, to play
with the health and the lives of his dupes.
He should be treated by the law in the
same way as other false pretenders.
The cheat who extracts a fiver from
you by asserting that he is your rich uncle
Fiji goes to gaol for a year or so.
ihe cheat who gets your money by
gambling with your life goes free. Par-
liaments should empower their medical
departments and their police and their
Courts to consign him to the same cell
as the other- spieler, for a term correspond-
ing to the gravity of the offence.
ANOTHER CENTENARY.
This is the centenary year of trade-
unionism in Australia. The first move
towards the formation of a union was
made by the N. S. Wales cabinet-makers
m 1833 ; but nothing came of it. Real
unionism was born with the advent of
the Typographical Union in 1835. The
seamen followed, and in 1837 were
strong enough to declare the first organ-
ised strike. Three years later two-thirds
or Sydney operatives were in unions and
struggling for the regulation of appren-
ticeship, wages and hours, and against
the importation of convicts and coolies.
So frequent had strikes become that
the Masters and Servants Bill, as intro-
duced in 1840, provided imprisonment
for strikers, together with forfeiture of
wages. But trade-union sentiment had
grown, too, and the measure was greatly
modified in the Legislative Council. Four-
years later unionism supported a Liberal
candidate at the elections.
, Th e hungry ’forties hit it hard, but
it revived with the discovery of gold.
The Eight-Hour Day became an
ideal. The Amalgamated Society of
Engineers was formed on board an
immigrant ship in 1852; the Car-
penters and Joiners arrived in 1854;
in the same year the Typos, had
a dispute with Henry Parkes, then con-
trolling the “Empire,” the “father of
the chapel” and other employees tasting
bread and water. Then the first union-
ist newspaper was born, the “Opera-
tive” ; but it lasted only a few months.
Victorian organisation began in 1840.
Actually, the masons formed the first
Melbourne union in 1850 ; in South Aus-
tralia the tailors had anticipated them
by four years. Queensland’s effort dates
from 1865.
In 1880 the trade-unionists of Balmain
(N.S.W.) got Jacob Garrard elected to
the Legislative Assembly. After the
shearers’ strike of 1891 the Labor party
emerged, helped by the Amalgamated
Workers. At that time there were 124
craft unions in Australia, with a member-
ship of 54,000. They were well served
by men like Holman, Hughes, Fisher,
Dawson, Kidston and Cook.
During the Great War period one-big-
union ideas made their appearance.
In 1923 J. S. Garden brought back
from Russia a plan to abolish craft union-
ism and replace it by mass organisation,
which would be easier for Communists
to manipulate. This scheme began to
operate from 1925, and since its incep-
tion the work of combining old unions has
gone on. In 1927 the new group system
dominated N. S. Wales politics, though it
has not succeeded in capturing the Labor
parties in other States. The centenary
year is witnessing one more move towards
the disappearance of the craft bodies—
the merging of the carpenters and brick-
layers, who together will form a body
greater than the whole number of arti-
sans in Australia when unionism was
founded.
Workers who are told by ranting agi-
tators that they can get nothing from the
present system without a revolution and
“the dictatorship of the proletariat”
should look back through the vista of a
century to see what unionism of the old
school has obtained for them. Laborers’
wages in 1835 were less than an office
boy gets to-day. Shop-assistants received
2s. 6d. a week and such miserable board
and lodging as their masters cared to give
them. For most 1835 workers the 1935
dole would have been regarded as good
regular remuneration, even allowing for
the difference in the value of money.
And in town industries hours were any-
thing the employer cared to make them.
In some there was no rest-day ; the hands
worked seven days a week.
The agitators, too, might look back and
breathe a little prayer of thanksgiving.
Some of the things they say with im-
punity to-day would have brought them
within reach of the penal law in 1835. A
seat in Parliament would not then have
been reserved for a demagogue who
affirmed in print that “the King of Eng-
land has fallen as low as it is possible for
a king to fall,” and who accompanied
the sentiment with rejoicing that “revolu-
tion had stepped On the stage.” Old
Sydney had trees enough, and was never
short of rope.
WHITE COLLAR.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
National Patriotism.
Next Sunday in the Saar, unless all the
omens lie, the world will be given an-
other object-lesson in nationalism.
Persons who were living in the Saar
when the Versailles Treaty came into
force will decide by vote on union with
Germany or with France or on the per-
petuation of the present orderly form of
government by commission under the
League.
Recovery of the Saar is necessary to
Germany and thrice necessary to the
Nazis ; but in preparing for the plebiscite
the German Government blundered as
usual. Over 75 p.c. of the 500,000 or so
entitled to vote are Catholics, and Hitler,
though himself a Catholic, has contrived
to alienate the R.C. Church; Cardinal
Faulhaber, Archbishop of Munich, “de-
nounced the profanation of God and
Christianity by the Third Reich” only last
week. The Nazi campaign against the
Jews has embittered . another section.
If the Saarlanders opt for reunion with
Germany they will become liable to
military service, their taxes will be in-
creased by at least 100 p.c., and they
will exchange their present generous
food-scale for the meagre German one.
Yet nobody has serious doubts as to
how the voting will go. The Saarlanders
are German expatriates through no fault
of their own, and the majority mean to
become German again if it ruins them.
This spirit—a readiness to suffer, even
die, for a dream —exemplifies again the
absurdity of the pacifist-internationalist
evangel. It is no use showing the best
kind of man how by being cunning and
abandoning his native land he can dodge
the liability to fight for any country and
live his life out in luxury. To the best
kind of man such an argument is irrele-
vant.

The Midget Army of Peace.
For upwards of a week 10,000 boys have
been dn camp near Frankston (Vic.). They
have been taking part in the “jamboree”
of the Boy Scouts of the world ; nearly
every country where there is a Scout
movement was represented. Chief Scout
Baden-Powell came all the way from
England to see the fruits of his efforts.
The Scout movement differs from all
other movements for indoctrinating
youngsters. Stalin’s Pioneers, for ex-
ample, are filled day and night with
Marxism and State worship. The Boy
Scout’s teaching is wholly moral; he
may be a Christian, a Jew, a Buddhist
or a Mohammedan —all were represented
at Frankston—without infringing Scout
law or violating his religious convictions.
While the movement is organised on
military lines it is in no way militarist.
It enjoins obedience to Scout law and re-
spect for the other fellow. It is demo-
cratic. In Scoutland, all are equal save
those who have gained promotion to
the higher ranks by revelation of their
merit.
If there is to be any national result
from the Boy Scout movement, it is dis-
tinctly in the direction of peace. The
lads of all the nations meet and learn
to know one another and to realise that
wonderful truth which their elders have
yet to learn —that there is, at bottom,
very little difference between a person of
one nationality, even of one color, and
a person of another. They will return
to their native lands recognising this fact,
and will form a leaven —small but im-
portant —which will have its effect with
their own people.
The Scout movement, whatever way it
is regarded, is a movement for world
peace. The good Scout will hate war-
fare as the Devil hates holy water.
The All-in-AIl.
A Westralian wheatfarmer to The
Bulletin :
We have bulk-handling at our siding,
and it saves me 3d. a bushel. I have
bought no bags for two years, and saved
the cost of twine and sewing as well.
Farmers in other parts of the district
are not so fortunate. Some within a few
miles of another Government railway cart
30 miles to our siding to get the advan-
tage of the bulk-handling. The Labor
Government won’t let our co-operative co.
set up bulk-handling plants throughout the
wheat belt, and it won’t establish them
itself. Why? Because some of the lumpers
who vote Labor might lose their jobs.
Still, in a sense, Westralian Labor is only
running true to form. It had its begin-
nings at Kalgoorlie in the early years of
the century, when the richest ore had
been rooted out and, costs being high,
it was becoming difficult for many man-
agements to mine at a profit. There were
more breweries and pubs in the place
than mines, but the price of beer was
maintained at 6d. a glass. A too-enter-
prising publican arranged to reduce it to
4d., getting his beer from “down the
line.” He did a roaring trade for a day
or two, and exultantly announced that
he could make a fair profit at 4d. But
he reckoned without Westralian Labor.
Tuppence off the glass of beer! If
Labor stood that Labor would suffer for
it; the loathsome capitalist on the Golden
Mile would reduce wages. The way to
keep up wages was to keep up prices.
Away with this blackleg of a publican
and his fourpenny beer! The innovator
was told that he would have to stop
selling it or Labor would shut him up,
perhaps run him out of the town. He
yielded.
Beer went back to sixpence a glass.
The process was extended to other com-
modities; costs were kept up while
the grade of ore went down. Surplus
breweries and pubs hung on, but Labor
could not impose its odd economic
theories on Nature or the Bank of Eng-
land, so thousands of miners lost their
jobs. Chiefly because it became unprofit-
able to mine Bdwt. or 9dwt. stuff the
number of persons employed in West-
ralian goldmines dwindled from 19,771 in
1901 to 3863 in 1928.
The margin of profit is all-important
to the farmer and the mineowner, but it
is of small consequence to Westralian
Labor compared with votes.

Zinovieff and Garden.
In 1923-24 Zinovieff was chairman of the
World Executive of the Communist Party,
and J. S. Garden was d member. At
that time Mr. Garden disagreed violently
with 99 per cent, of the people of Aus-
tralia about its system of government.
The Government didn’t mind; it had
more faith in its system than in
the power of Mr. Garden for mis-
chief. It let him travel across the world
to confer with people who were plotting
to overthrow the British Empire. It even
let him stand for Parliament as a Com-
munist.
The changing seasons have placed Mr.
Garden in a unique position. They
have seen him elected to the Parliament
which he wished to replace with a Soviet
and a “dictatorship of the proletariat.”
The taxpayers pay him a salary, give
him a gold railway pass and print
his balderdash gratis.
How different has been the lot of his
colleagues of the E.C.C.1.! Lenin was
shot by a dissatisfied subject, and died a
lingering death. Trotsky is an exile under
sentence of death if he returns to Russia.
Zinovieff, now a t.b. case, has been sent
to an island in the White Sea with a tem-
perature which is “never above zero.”
Some of the minor members have gone
the way of Lenin, and some are fugitives
with a price on their heads.
It must occur to Mr. Garden as he
recalls the fate of Zinovieff and looks
at his salary list and his suites of
offices that, however good Communism
may be, there are points in living under
“capitalism” and democracy and in being
an Australian, if only by adoption.

Melbourne’s Early Trams.
For some reason never explained Mel-
bourne’s Tramway Board won’t have all-
night services. It refuses to provide
transport beyond the sacred hour on its
timetable, even on emergency occasions
when thousands of people would pay
extra to be carried home.
When the bells rang out to usher in
1934 there were 50,000 visitors at St.
Kilda. When they tired of their revelry
and wanted to get to their beds they dis-
covered that there was no tramway trans-
port after the fixed time which the board
deemed was right and proper for retire-
ment. Those 50,000 fares were lost to
the department. It would possibly be
more correct to say that 100,000 fares
were lost, for every one of those stranded
celebrants would have cheerfully paid
double fare after midnight rather than
walk miles or go to the expense of hiring
a taxi.
Even with that experience the Tram-
way Board again refused this year to put
cars on the rails after midnight or there-
abouts. Thus the same inconvenience
was forced on the public, and the same
loss has been incurred by the enterprise.
In the matter of all-night trams the
cities of the world vary to an astonishing
degree. Sydney runs hourly trams at
raised fares over a number of lines
throughout the year, and, though it is
questionable if they pay, they are cer-
tainly a great convenience. London has
all-night trams only on the lines running
due north; people who live east,
south or west of central London have
to take a taxi or walk. Though there is
a ’bus every two hours in one direction,
there are neither trams nor tubes nor any
other mode of conveyance. Paris does
not run all-night trams or trains except
on occasions. Neither does New York.
Strangely enough, ’Frisco, a city of
only 600,000 inhabitants, runs a quarter-
hour service on all lines right through
the night without increase of fares.
’Frisco’s lines are partly municipal and
partly privately-owned, so it is unlikely
that the all-night service is run at a loss.
The crowded condition of the cars at,
say, 3 a.m. indicates that they are run at
a considerable profit.
This suggests that profit or loss on
such services is largely a matter of public
education. If people know that there is
always a tram at the corner, no matter
what time it is, they won’t bother to
hurry home, with the result that there
is an even patronage throughout the
night.

The Chaos of Taxes.
There are 260 closely-printed foolscap
pages in the second and third reports of
the Royal Commission on Taxation. It
says a great deal for Ferguson, J., and his
colleague, E. V. Nixon, that they have
been able to wade through chaos and
remain sane.
In 1932-33 seven Governments ex-
tracted £48,951,072 in actual collections,
upwards of £31,000,000 coming from in-
come and wages taxes. Land tax pro-
duced another £3,128,000; sales tax,
£9,000,000. Yet politicians were aston-
ished that the country was not recovering
rapidly.
If a N. S. Welshman earned £5OOO a
year from property Commonwealth and
State took 12s. 2d. in the £ from him,
apart from other taxes and rates. If he
died the State demanded up to 25 p.c.
of his estate, the Commonwealth 15 p.c.
of the balance. Two or three deaths and
a year or two of unpaid taxation and
there might be nothing left for the heirs.
The main complaint of the Royal Com-
mission about the plague of taxes is the
lack of uniformity. There’s not even
unanimity as to what income is (“none
of the Acts contain a complete and satis-
factory definition of income”). Each
State has a different system of penalising
property earnings. Property incomes and
personal-exertion incomes reach maxi-
mum taxation point at different stages in
different areas. Different deductions are
allowed by Queensland on one bank of
the usually dry Macintyre River and
N.S.W. on the other. And while the late-
payer is penalised 8 p.c. on the Victorian
side of the Murray, he is hounded for
10 p.c. on the N.S.W. side.
The Commission is for uniformity and
one collecting agency. It would be
better if the whole field of income tax
were vacated by the States. The Com-
monwealth might take over education by
way of compensation.
Unnecessary Picnics.
In these days of air mails and animated
photography and virtual perfection in en-
gineering publications, it seems unneces-
sary for managers of insolvent Govern-
ment railways to absent themselves for
long periods so that they may gaze at
railways in other countries ; but they per-
sist in doing it. Victoria’s Clapp has just
returned from an overseas tour on which
he saw “many cases of lavish expendi-
ture which proved to be wholly unwar-
ranted” (he could see plenty in his own
country), and Sydney’s Hartigan proposes
to follow suit. So, at least, the news-
papers announced —Mr. Hartigan has a
very good “press” —but Mr. Stevens sig-
nificantly states that while “some” rail-
wayman may be sent abroad Cabinet
will make the selection.
All these jaunts should be vetoed.
Taxpayers have to foot the bills, and
much better uses could be found for their
money.

What of Sharks?
From a surfing pioneer:
A lad and a girl were taken by sharks—it
may have been the same shark —in George’s
River, Sydney, on December 31. The lad is
dead; the girl is cruelly maimed.
I studied sharks and their ways for 10 years
while living on Bondi beach. I was in the
water every day the thermometer was over
60deg.: in addition, I gathered from books and
ichythyologists and fishermen and bathers all
they had seen and heard about sharks. The
result was that I became satisfied that the shark
is an eccentric fish whose actions can never
be accurately predicted. The one and only
safe thing is to keep out of his way.
All the same, I came to the conclusion that
the man-eating shark is as rare as the man-
eating lion or tiger; the average shark will
pass a thousand opportunities to bite a bather.
There are many incidents that support this
theory. A Bondi girl scolded her escort (“You
silly fool; you hurt me then!”) under the im-
pression that he had buffeted her with his
knee or elbow; she had been hit by the fin
or the tail of a six-footer which had passed
on without trying to bite either. A shark lay
apparently sleeping throughout an entire
summer’s afternoon under the staging of the old
Mercantile boatsheds in Circular Quay, though
dozens of rowing men had plunged in and
scrambled out within a couple of feet of his
jaws. A shark which became stranded at low
tide in a bogey-hole was filled with no emotion
but fear when a foolhardy youth jumped in
with a noose to capture it.
The trouble is that nobody knows when he is
going to meet a shark which is eccentric or
mentally deficient or lacking in normal instincts.
And the greatest danger has always been the
belief that sharks do not infest fresh water and
“never come up as far as this.” Not only are
they at home in brackish water; they can live
and thrive for a time in water free from salt.
A shark may swim up any river until it meets
with obstruction.
Sydney Harbor itself is thick with sharks.
Some of the catches of sharks more than five
feet long are astounding. I once saw one day’s
catch by one boat piled tip along the sea wall
at Watson’s Bay. It looked for all the world
like a large tin of sardines. Sharks would prob-
ably be fished out of harbors and estuaries if
they were consistent in their habits.
The shark can be put to profitable use if
supplies can only be relied on. He has a way
of coming and going without any apparent
reason and leaving an expensive plant to rot.
One of the authorities I consulted said it
would be a bad thing for the fishing industry
around 'Sydney if sharks were exterminated.
The useful fish, he explained, were mostly eaten
by the salmon, and the salmon in turn provided
the greater part of the food for the sharks.
If there were no sharks to deplete the salmon
hordes, these would eat up all the edible fish
in the sea.

The Grasshopper Moves On.
State Governments were dilatory in
dealing with the grasshopper. They
were warned early in the spring, but the
pest had two months’ start before they
began to act. By October 31 enough
grass had been eaten in N. S. Wales to
warrant political action, so Agricultural
Minister Main produced a Noxious
Insects Bill, and asked that it be passed
at a sitting.
Somebody asked whether there was
any danger to the wheat.
Mr. Main: Not at present. The treat-
ment to protect a wheat crop when they are
in the ’hopper stage is very simple. If bail
is scattered round the edges of the crop the
’hoppers will attack the bait.
The bill was passed. It provides for
compulsory notification of ’hoppers and
compulsory destruction by poison. Land-
holders were told that the egg-beds,
though spread over 42 million acres in
N. S. Wales, were in limited areas, and
could be sprayed for ss. or 6s. an acre.
The result has not been flattering to
the Minister. The ’hoppers are now
down to the edges of the Blue Moun-
tains. They have eaten out whole pro-
perties. In the Ungarie (N.S.W.) police-
patrol district —one of the largest in N. S.
Wales —they are estimated to have eaten
30 p.c. of the wheat, and had they been
earlier, when the grain was not so ripe,
they might have had the lot. Riverina
landholders report that it is “impossible
to deal with them solely by spreading
poisoned baits prepared by the depart-
ment.”
Anybody who has followed the posi-
tion in Africa will agree with these
graziers. After years of isolated efforts
an international bureau representing the
whole continent south of Kenya was
formed in November to try to oust the
locust. “A variety of methods” had been
tried, and there is cheap labor in abun-
dance, but, in the absence of concerted
action, gas from aeroplanes, poison, fungi
and preying insects have all failed. This
year the insects are stripping large areas
in Africa. Now concerted action has
been decided upon among 12 African
States.
The grasshopper should become a
Commonwealth affair. Stringent meas-
ures should be taken against him before
next spring, but they must be nation-
wide. If a few swarms could visit Can-
berra in the meantime to give a demon-
stration, it would help.

Youth’s Workless Army.
“Eric the Red’s” warning-signal;
Official estimates set forth that there are in
Victoria 22,771 boys and girls between 16 and
21 years of age who have never worked. If
the University’s figures are considered, the
number of young people who have received or
sat for thfeir “intermediate” and “leaving”
school certificates during the past five years
is 80,000, and of these 70,000 have been
unable to find employment. In other words,
seven out of every eight children whose educa-
tion has been sufficient to justify their facing
examinations which are supposed to be a pre-
liminary to working for a living are denied
that living by the prevailing economic condi-
tions. „ ,
Besides such figures as these, the parrot-cry
that we have turned the corner is so much
blah The outstanding fact is there is a vast
army of young Australians entering manhood
and womanhood with nothing to occupy their
time and with no means of livelihood but those
provided by their parents, relatives, friends or
the dole. The majority will inevitably nurse a
grudge against the society which denies them
work and the political parties which have been
so rich in promises and so shy of performances.
Many will/ drift in desperation towards the
extremists who aim at throwing the whole social
system in the melting-pot.
Each year there will be an influx of 70,000
or 80,000 new voters on the roll. If these
voters regard the red traffic signal as an indica-
tion to speed up, it requires only a sum in
simple multiplication to work out the date when
they will be in charge.

"AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKS"
Spare Corp”: Seldom did an idio-
syncrasy or obsession among his
superiors escape the notice of a Digger.
There was a bird in our company who
was perpetually offending a C.O. with
an enthusiasm for well-shaven chins. Bill
being the only man who failed to respond
to the smartening influence from high
quarters, his platoon chief took him aside
and eloquently urged him to make an
effort to avoid the eternal censure. “Ah,
what’s the use?” drawled the offender.
“What I’d call a clean shave he’d call
a full set of whiskers and a beard!”

Dun Dhu”: The High Court’s ruling
that Gaelic is not a modern European
language reminds me that I have attended
church services in Arran where the entire
proceedings were in Gaelic. And in 1918,
when conscription was in full swing in
England, the Welsh regiment to which
I was attached found it necessary to
appoint officers and n.c.os. with a know-
ledge of the Welsh language—closely
akin to Scottish Gaelic, as every philo-
logist knows—owing to the number of
recruits from the hills of North Wales
who could not speak a word of English'.
* * * *
“Philo”: It is always a puzzle to me
why Americans abbreviate certain forms
of English speech to save a syllable
and elongate others. For instance, “out
the door” is just as intelligible as “out of
the door,” “six-seven” as six or seven.
And I wouldn’t say that “sure” isn’t an
improvement on “surely,” employed as
an emphatic affirmative. On the other
hand, I can’t see the necessity for saying
or writing “gotten”—-though it has a cer-
tain Biblical flavor —when “got” means
the same thing. And why drag out
“over” into “overly”? I have never yet
heard an Englishman or an Australian
saying “overly,” though it may linger in
Scotland.

“Grapeshot”; I dislike contradicting
folk, but I maintain against “M.H.E.”
(B. 2/1 / ’35) that Wells’s portrait of
Colonel Tom Price was a faithful one,
and I cannot agree that Price’s man-
ners were those of “any well-bred British
staff officer”—any I can recall, at least.
At one period outside Bloemfontein I
saw Price every day, and heard much of
him from his regiment, which was bri-
gaded with mine. Owing to discrepancy
in rank, I never spoke to him —I was a
l ull private—but his outward appearance
measured right up to Wells’s description.
I should classify him as a mixture of
“Bull” Ryrie and Jack Antill, but more of
a rough diamond than either. As an army
linguist, Price overshadowed his Austra-
lian contemporaries, and is even said to
have attracted the attention of old
“Charley” Tucker, affectionately known
among other ranks as “the Blanky Old
Blanker,” and renowned from Peshawar
to Piccadilly as the most accomplished
ground and lofty blasphemer in the two
services.

“Western”: Speaking of salvaged
whisky, there’s always a chance of a case
or two turning up on the Westralian coast
between Rockingham and Mandurah.
In 1898 the Carlisle Castle went down
off Long Point with all hands and a cargo
which included thousands of cases of
whisky. For weeks after the coast for
miles was strewn with salvage, and
though Customs men were early on the
spot they were not quick enough to pre-
vent the local beachcombers making a
good haul. Many a case was hurriedly
buried in the adjacent sand dunes, with
the salvors hardly in a condition to take
proper notice of landmarks, the result
being that one is still stumbled on occa-
sionally,

“G.M.”: Melbourne’s
new swimming pool,
right in the city itself
and containing all the
newest improvements,
is about to open.
Despite the protests
of nudists against
the mixed bathing
which will make the
practice of their cult
impossible, the pool
looks to have a rosy
future. Meanwhile, the
Yarra is beginning to
take its proper place as
a swimming resort.
Above the Monash
Bridge the banks are
now packed with
youths and damsels
sunbaking, and before
long the local councils
will be forced to supply
dressing-sheds. It is
not many years since
bathing in the Yarra
was forbidden by law
“Hey, you, where’s your trainin’? Take the woman
back and come down accordin’ to regulations.”
—“b ath i n g in pro-
hibited hours” was the
offence set out on the
charge sheet. It didn’t
matter whether you
were costumed for
swimming or not. It
used to be a joke
among Yarraside
people that if you fell
into the stream you
had one of two destinations. If drowned,
you were taken to the morgue ; if alive,
you were taken to the lock-up.

“Scribe”: Washington hints that the
Roosevelt Administration may suppress
the “Saturday Evening Post” if it doesn’t
abandon its intention of publishing cer-
tain strictures on N.I.R.A. Such action is
extremely unlikely, for the “Post” is more
than a newspaper—it is a national insti-
tution. No other journal in the world
has such imposing offices, which over-
look the park attached to Liberty Hall,
where the Declaration of Independence
was drawn up. As you enter the door
you face a marble fountain with a vast
Maxfield Parrish mosaic behind it. The
office itself is more like a club, with
magnificent dining- and rest-rooms, a
dance-hall and other incidentals. The
machine-room is a revelation even to'
people used to newspaper offices. Until
I saw it I hardly realised there were so
many machines in the world, for the
“S.E.P,” is printed on flat-bed presses—
hundreds of them, it appears at a glance
—in order to preserve the quality of
the color-printing. To keep up with the
circulation, the presses are seldom idle,
and the bulk of advertising is so great
that the papers go to press six weeks
before they reach the public. The actual
newsprint in a copy of the “Post,” which
sells for five cents in the U.S.A., costs
nearly 25 cents.

“Bramham Moor”: One of the last
strongholds of the sporting male is fast
being invaded by the female. In a list
of British packs at the beginning of the
1934 season, 18 women figure as
“masters” of foxhounds, several of them
hunting their own packs, while there is
a long list of female hunt secre-
taries. Surtees’s novels rarely men-
tion a hunting woman, save those of
ffie Lucy Glitters type. Beginning in the
’sixties and ’seventies, the flood swelled
until to-day one may count more women
than men in many a field.

“Bara Peg”: I agree with “Hoplite”
(B. 2/1/’35). Instead of having fewer
titles we ought to have more ;' but they
should not be free. They are a great incen-
tive to endeavor, and provide innocent
happiness for minds otherwise without re-
source. At present there are only enough
to fill the bare needs of Lord Mayors and
the like, but if we had a decent selection,
with stars to match, and licensed- hospi-
tals and charities to sell some of them, it
would be possible to abolish State lot-
teries. That sort of thing was done in
India for centuries before Rustum Beg
lusted for a C.S.I. Sometimes payment
was taken out in drains and sometimes in
cavalry regiments. I am sure that the
right people would pay handsomely to
be the Australian equivalents of General
Far zand-i-khas-Dowlat-i-Inglishia-Man-
sur-ul-Zaman-A m i r-ul-Omra-Maharaja-
D i r a g-Raj-Rsjeseshwar-Shri-Maharaj-i-
Rajgan-Sir Mick O’Flaherty-Khan Baha-
dur, K.C.1.E., C.S.I. It sounds much
better than “Sir M. O’Flaherty, K.8.E.”

“Hoplite”; Haig may have been par-
about dress regulations (B.
19 /12/’34) as applied to the lower orders
of military life ; some of his army com-
manders were equally given to ignoring
the fact that example is better than pre-
cept. Rawlinson was one of the worst
offenders ; I recall a photographic group
in which he is conspicuous with hunting
stock, incomplete Sam Browne and a pair
of fancy gaiters which might have be-
longed to Sam Weller. Monro would
not permit this sort of thing when he
commanded the Ist Army, and when
C.-in-C. India he forbade the wearing
of khaki slacks. Nevertheless, he donned
them himself when touring the plains in
summer.
“G.M.”: Possibly the shortest example
of a mixed metaphor in Parliament was
that of N.S.W. Mines Minister Copeland
in the ’nineties. He announced drama-
tically that the railways were “cutting the

“Oxmead” : You can’t be too careful
these days when conveying currency
from a bank to its destination. At a pay-
ing counter I watched with a mild interest
the cashing of a cheque for a good many
hundred pounds. The payees—two-
took their money in every sort of de-
nomination, and besides the notes there
was a huge stack of silver and copper,
the lot being carefully stowed in
a solid businesslike bag. It had two
handles, and each of the emissaries
manacled his wrist to one of these with
something that looked uncommonly like
a handcuff. Being curious to see what
effect the passage of the pair with their
obviously precious freight would have
upon the Christmas-crowded pavements
I followed them to the door. It was a
little startling to find that, after all these
precautions, they had less than 50 yards
to go—no further than across the street.

“N’lmporte”: Regarding the Colohan
portrait of Vance Palmer presented to
Brisbane Art Gallery (B. 5 /12/’34), the
artist’s name is not omitted from the
canvas, although there is nothing to in-
dicate who the sitter is. This is a general
weakness of the gallery, although quite
recent efforts have been made to give
names of subject and artist by means of
white cards. Even the Lucrece is a
puzzle to the uninitiated. Most visitors
mistake it for a Venus toying with a
dagger. It would surely be easy to
let the public know what it is and some-
thing about the generous, if mysterious,
donor of this magnificent marble.

“Baviaan”: Those Egyptians who de-

the years before the Boer War the sub-
ject of locust destruction periodically
cropped up in the Transvaal Raadzaal.
Motions in favor of it by the educated
minority were invariably squelched by
back-veld farmers on the ground that the
locusts had been sent by the Almighty
to punish the community for its sins, and
to interfere with them would be the un-
forgivable sin referred to in Holy Writ.

July’s proud Fourth still comes to date and
docket
Their deathless doings with a nation’s praise,
With fiery eloquence and blazing rocket
And other pyrotechnical displays.
And who shall say—and how indeed do we
know —
The grateful land whose spokesmen you have
been
Won’t presently declare an annual beano
To keep your memories green?
What though in pleasantest of scenes your
job is,
What though diplomacy is all you use
In London clubs and Parliamentary lobbies,
At vintners’ boards and similar shivoos,
From silver Swan to plains of dry Nullarbor
They still may rank you, for your just reward,
With those who grabbed the tea in Boston
Harbor
And dumped it overboard.
Cheer up, you lusty champions of Secession !
Take comfort, spite of sneers and gibes and
smirks,
You've registered defiance at oppression
And given grinding tyranny “the works.”
Your names may yet attain the same tran-
scendence
And in unwritten tomes of history mix
With those who signed the Dec. of. Inde-
pendence
In Sev’nteen Sev’nty-six!

“Scribe”: Twenty-six years ago last
Boxing Day I saw the fight between John-
son and Burns. I was seated beside Billy
Hughes, then Federal Attorney-General.
Just when everybody was waiting for the
gong to sound, the announcer came for-
ward and cried: “Johnson refuses to
fight until Burns removes the bandages
from his hands.” Instantly a wild howl
went up from the 16,000 spectators. As
the noise died down, individual protests
could be heard, including a jocular re-
mark from my neighbor; “We’ll deport
the cow.” “Mr. Hughes,” I saicT; “I’m
cabling this fight to London. That remark
of yours will make good ‘copy,’ But I’ll
substitute ‘nigger’ for ‘cow.’ ” Billy took
me seriously. He saw all England smiling
over this breezy Australian Attorney-
General who sat at ringsides threatening
to deport colored prizefighters. “Oh,
no,” he said. “You mustn’t do that.” 1
promised him that I would take his re-

tea?”
mark as strictly confidential, and I have
kept silence until this moment. But Billy
won’t mind now. That was when he was
young and impulsive and a member of
the Labor party.

“Fulgur”: For a long time there has
been a wordy argument as to whether a
’plane in the air can be affected by
lightning—there was a Bulletin sym-
posium on the subject some months
ago. Experts have pronounced that
all modern machines are lightning-
proof, the immunity being due to the
bonding of all metal parts to prevent
sparking. As the gases of the exhaust
form an ideal conductor of electricity, the
’plane becomes practically its own light-
ning conductor. Yet the Dutch Gov-
ernment is satisfied that the crash
of its airliner in Syria was due to light-
ning. The controls were found in perfect
order, and the instruments indicated no-
thing in the way of a sideslip or nose-dive,
so the Dutch conclude that lightning shat-
tered the ’plane, killed the pilot or fired
the petrol. Another possibility is that
the machine may have been capsized by
the rush of expanding air following on
the flash.

“S.T.S.”: A kind-
hearted visitor who
supplied Christmas
tobacco for the in-
mates of Yatala
(S.A.) prison (pet
name “The Stock-
ade”) has been sent
to join them for 12
weeks. The explana-
tion is that, having
been released only
that morning, he
came back by moon-
light to hide tobacco
in the big quarries
adjoining the prison.
The official view is
that, if tobacco can
be thus secreted, the
same can be done
with liquor or guns.
With weapons thus
obtained four
quarry-workers once
held up their guards
and got away—to
fight a fatal losing battle with the police
in the streets of a distant suburb some
hours later.

Gilbert Mant (Canada): Enter this
in the Long Arm Stakes, I was a
rabbitskin buyer in the Monaro (N.S.W.)
district. One day on a desolate part
of the Cooma-Adaminaby road a
huge, untidy-looking man with five
days’ growth on his face and a
bundle of evil-smelling skins in his hands
lumbered out of the bush and addressed
me in what I took to be an Oxford
accent. I bought his skins, and we cob-
bered-up for a few weeks before he dis-
appeared. The other day—lo years after-
wards —a large, spruce man, holding an
important post with the Canadian Gov-
ernment, walked into my office here. He
failed to recognise me until I asked:
“Know anything about rabbitskins?”
“Shade of Terry O’Rourke!” he
boomed, and then added anxiously,
“Hush! I’ve gone respectable!” “So
have I!” I replied as we went off to sink
some Canuck beer.

“Cosmos”: According to a “leading
London wine-merchant” (Sydney “Sun”),
“the cocktail is, medically, socially,
scientifically and aesthetically, an abomi-
nation.” True, no doubt; but the cock-
tail—or rather the cocktail party, which
is the cocktail’s raison d'etre —has a
5000-year-old appeal which will not be
overcome by fusillades of polysyllabic
abuse. The rise and fall of three cocktail
parties out of four is stereotyped. The
guests arrive sober—usually at about the
time the Edwardians had afternoon-tea.
By, say, 5.15, most of them are cheery
and—under the influence of the savory
“All your troubles will soon be over”
“Lott’ry?”
“No, cornetry.”
sandwiches —thirsty. By 5.30 several are
definitely sozzled. At this stage some-
body adds a bottle of whisky or brandy
to the brew. By six those who are not
orgy-conscious have left; somebody
freshens up the mixture with another
bottle of any powerful intoxicant that
happens to be handy, and dance-music
is turned on. The only difference between
the cocktail party and the orgy is that the
former has been respectabilised by the
gossip-press and by a few innocent old
birds who give cocktail parties at which
nothing more exciting than orange-juice
is served.

“Quartan”: The recent outbreak of
malignant malaria in Ceylon is a re-
minder that the disease may yet prove a
greater danger to the world than war
itself. There is plenty of proof that
malaria destroyed more than one old-
time civilisation. Nor is it confined to
hot climates. It still crops up occasion-
ally in England, where it was a menace
for centuries. A great part of Australia
is familiar with it, and the anopheles mos-
quito which spreads the plague is to be
found far south of the actual fever line.
The Ceylon outbreak has temporarily
exhausted the world’s quinine market.
Were it to extend to Europe and the
Americas, to say nothing of Australia
and Africa, the only known palliative
might be unobtainable in anything like
the quantity needed.

“Dickey Beech”; This new
rubber float for surfing is a dan-
gerous toy. It was responsible
for 21 calls to the lifesavers at
Southport (Q.) in one day. An
exhilarating help for strong swim-
mers —although they are liable to
be badly dumped if they don’t
watch the thing—and those wise
to the risks of gutters and cur-
rents, it is a sheer invitation to
unintentional suicide when used
by the ignorant and' unskilled. It
is a disloyal machine, too —it gave
the Duke of Gloucester his first
experience of a dump, in the
Mooloolaba surf, and he didn’t
like it at all. The old-fashioned
surfboard is a better present for a lad —
one must already be skilful to use it.
* * * *
“Filmite”: “Wollstra” wouldn’t worry
me if I were a grazier. It is over 50
per cent, fibre, which means that clothes
made from it look unshapely after a very
short time. Quarter of a century
ago fully 95 per cent, of Ameri-
can, Canadian, Australasian and S’Afri-
can whites and about 75 per cent,
of Britons didn’t care how they
dressed. The talkies have changed all that.
The average male of British or American
stock in the Hollywood-Elstree belt is as
clothes-conscious as the average woman ;
if you doubt it look at the gossip-press
advts. It would be impossible to keep
the Clark Gable-Jack Buchanan line for
more than a day with wollstra or any
other synthetic material. The Continental
businessman hasn’t worried about his
clothes for over a century ; the Nordic
of caricature (boots like bluchers, a cheap
straw hat, a suit that might be home-
made) can be seen not only in Germany,
Norway and Sweden, but all over France,
Italy and Russia. He will wear wollstra
if the price is right. But dressy Con-
tinentals, who have been getting their
suits, shoes, shirts and even hats from
the West End of London for genera-
tions, won’t look at the new product,
and neither will the millions of British
and American men who have become
dressy since the war. In a very real
sense Australia’s best friend is the movie,

“Mako”: It was because he was en-
tirely unacquainted with a disease in
which he ran a high temperature (B.
2/1 /’35) that measles proved so fatal to
the Maori. His instinct when feeling hot
and uncomfortable was to seek the near-
est creek and find relief in the cold water,
No amount of pakeha argument had any
effect on the stricken natives, and the
wahines likewise bathed the fevered
youngsters when the European counsel-
lors turned their backs. Early records
of M.L. tell of a great sickness that
swept over the northern tribes with dire
results. There is little doubt that this
was a visitation of measles or some other
epidemic carried to M.L. by the whalers
at the beginning of last century.

“Jock”: Why blame Mae West for the

“El V.”; The proposed formation of
two battalions to wear the uniform of
the Black Watch in N. S. Wales will
reconnect one of our oldest military
links. The second Black Watch bat-
talion (the 73rd) was the first great
British regiment to be sent to Aus-
tralia. It came under the command
of Lachlan Macquarie after the Bligh
rebellion. The original half (the 42nd)
was once. commanded by Macquarie’s
brother. It is the oldest Scottish for-
mation in the British Army, apart from
the Royal Scots and the Fusilier Guards,
and was raised just before Culloden. It
has long-standing associations with India,
and owns a beautiful mess building and
compound at Mooltan. More than
once it has abandoned the kilt on service
—the mosquitoes of Culaba drove the
73rd into trousers in 1784, and 4s
present outfit in the tropics consists of
wide shorts, khaki shirt and jacket and a
cap with the red hackle. Some young
officers who buy its full-dress kit won’t
be able to pay their income tax this vear.
THE BARD AND THE BOOMERANGS.
“The Poet Laureate returned front Australia with
a number of boomerangs with which he intends to
practise at his Cirencester home. ‘I am gradually
becoming proficient at throwing,’ he told a London
interviewer.
He found a lot to marvel and to glory at,
From towering gums to fascinating girls;
Spellbound he gazed on chunks of metal aureate
And, lost in admiration, viewed our pearls.
But what particularly gripped the Laureate
Was that quaint implement the abo. hurls.
The weirdly whirring weapon which he throws
To down his dinner or to fell his foes.
He heard the kookaburra’s eerie laughter
And, like as not, indulged in mild surmise
Concerning what tne strident fowl was after;
He viewed the bounding Too with curious
eyes.
In short, he scanned our land from floor to
rafter,
And naught that scoots or leaps or skims or
flies
Impressed the bard of seas and ships who sang
Half so intensely as the boomerang.
He wore his laurels like some sterling pendant;
The fairest eyes upon him raptly smiled;
Nathless his thoughts would stray from halls
resplendent
To where the native of the trackless wild,
Or, rather, his degenerate descendant .
At La Perouse or Tyers domiciled,
Projects his whizzing dinguses to thrill
The tourist with his diabolic skill.
I picture Johp where Cots wold hills sequester
The poet from this mundane strife and stir
And gloomy care, too oft a day-infester,
Beneath some avenue of beech or fir
Hard by the old-world town spelled Cirencester
And generally sounded Cissiter;
In rural solitudes I see him stand
With Binghi’s life-preserver in his hand.
A carven club he sends upon its curving
Itinerary through the frosty air;
Marks its erratic capers with observing
Eyes to discover how it goes and where;
Masters the why and wherefore of the swerving
And lays the mystery of the come-back bare.
Think with what zest renewed his lyre he’ll
twang
After a wrestle with the boomerang!

POLITICAL POINTS
Of the three State general elections due
this year, Victoria’s ought to come first;
its last vote was taken on May 14, 1932
whereas N. S. Wales and Queensland
went to the poll on June 11. But the in-
dications are that Queensland will book
the earliest date. For some unexplained
reason Queensland Labor is having the
electoral boundaries altered, though the
job was done before the last election, and
done well.
Westralia’s “Mirror” prints a copy of
an unemployed-relief department certi-
ficate handed to a worker when he was
put off. “If he is not to return, state
reason,” the formula says; the reason
was “Refuses to join A.W.U.; hence dis-
charge as per instruction.” The original
is to be preserved for the “History of the
Decline and Fall of Westralian Labor
and the A.W.U.”
The Government will have to arrange
this year for another Governor-General.
Isaac Isaacs was appointed on January
22, 1931, and, although he may be asked
to stay on for a bit when his five years
are up —as Stonehaven did and Munro
Ferguson—this is unlikely ; for one thing
he will be 80 on August 6. It is also un-
likely that another Australian will suc-
ceed him, though the first Australian
appointment has been a success. When
Lyons and Menzies go to London
they will see if there is anything in the
report from that quarter that the Duke
of Kent would come.
There is no love lost nowadays between
Lyons and Ogilvie, who was Joseph’s
Attorney-General for four years. The
Labor Premier expected to get £35,000 as
his State’s share of the Commonwealth
mining grant; when he found that it
would not exceed £25,000 and that £9OOO-
- of that was conditional on his find-
ing a similar amount, he spluttered some-
thing about “a confidence trick.” His
erstwhile leader retorted that he had
had enough of “this snarling from Tas-
mania” and that it came “with very bad
grace” from a party that had promised
to produce miracles from its own hat.
A report from Britain, which has a
small professional army and Territorials,
recruited by voluntary enlistment, says
that Sir Maurice Hankey recommends
compulsory military training for Aus-
tralia. According to one account, Sir
Maurice Hankey “would not confirm or
deny the report,” but the subject must
have been mentioned. Supporters of
compulsory training in Australia have
a sufficiently good case without the neces-
sity of its being bolstered up by Sir
Maurice Hankey or any other brasshat
from abroad.
After, a five hours’ debate, Cabinet
agreed to restrict exports of beef and
veal to Britain till March 31. C.P.
members, who were fully aware that re-
striction would be imposed whether they
liked it or not (where there is only one
buyer he can enforce his own terms), put
up a stern fight for no-restriction, and
Lyons has imposed conditions: (1) The
agreement is not to be taken as a prece-
dent; (2) a long-term arrangement must
be discussed in April or May. The “con-
ditions” had been accepted beforehand,
N.S.W. Cabinet Ministers had to be
called together last week to choose Mayors
for the city of Sydney and the suburbs
of Redfern and Waterloo, the aldermen
having failed to agree. In each case they
reappointed the man who had held the
job the previous twelvemonth —Parker in
Sydney, Gardiner in Redfern and Lynch
in Waterloo. There are precedents for
this course (though Lang would laugh
at them), but it is a fool of a method of
selection. There would be no dead-
locks and no wrangling, before and after,
if the ratepayers elected the Mayor, as
they do in Perth.
The plebiscite of January 13 will not
see the end of the Saar episode. Which-
ever way it goes, the territory will remain
under League-committee control for a
year. Then there is the transfer of the
mines to be arranged—if Germany wins
it must pay for them in gold, which
Hiller says he hasn’t got, or leave them
in French hands. And if it doesn’t win
—the chance is very slight—the Nazi
element will have to be dealt with some-
how.
Glorious as it looks to remote ladies
like Katherine Prichard, Sovietism has
never caught on in the border States to
the west. Finland, Latvia, Esthonia,
Lithuania and Poland were all parts of
Czarist Russia, and they see the “dictator-
ship of the proletariat” at work from
their back doors, as it were ; yet not one
of them has any use for it. In fact, after
17 years, they are more anti-Bolsh. than
ever. In Sydney recently an Esthonian
choir stopped singing a national song
until a Soviet flag which had been intro-
duced into the proceedings without warn-
ing was removed.
“While you're barging, Archie, here's Billy getting away with the girl."
“S. M. Herald,” in its terse and daring
style:
There is a general expectation that at
some unspecified date in the next year or
two Mr. Lyons will indicate his unwilling-
ness to continue any further the burden of
leadership. ,
Lyons, “Granny” says, has picked Men-
zies as his successor; but Parkhill wants
to be deputy-leader. His appointment
would, however, “raise difficulties” with
Hughes, who was Prime Minister when
Parkhill was a mere Nat. secretary. Earle
Page is not in the running ; under the
terms of the alliance, no Cocky leader
can become head of the Government. If
Lyons retires to the Inter-State Commis-
sion or something as comfortable this
year, there will be a distinct chance for
Hughes, who is regaining a lot of his old
influence inside and outside the House.
Stevens has a bread war on his hands.
Though taxes have been cut and flour
is much cheaper than in Brisbane and
Perth, bread is always dearer in Sydney
than in other capitals, and Stevens is
convinced that the trade can carry the
Commonwealth flour tax of £2 12s. 6d. a
ton. He says he will fix the price if
the bakers persist in raising it, as they
announced they would do on Monday.
The bakers profess to believe it’s “just an
electioneering stunt” on his part. It
will be a very effective stunt if he doesn’t
weaken.
Old-age and invalid pensions in force
at the end of December increased from
251,405 in 1933 to 266,408 in 1934. The
cost for the 1934-35 financial year is
reckoned at £12,000,000. Commonwealth
income tax has rarely returned as much
in a twelvemonth.
Arnold Wienholt, M.L.A. for Fassifern
(Q.), is retiring from politics. In five
years he did not miss a sitting, and he
struggled valiantly, if vainly, against the
mania for borrowing. The House could
better spare half a dozen party hacks.
The municipal election at Broken Hill
hinged on the offer of the mining cos. to
supply the council with electricity for next
to nothing. Labor opposed the offer on
the ground that a strike on the mines
would put the town in darkness. Its 12
candidates were elected. That was on the
first of December. On the last day of
the month the town was blackened by a
strike of engine-drivers at the municipal
electricity works. It was a bit awkward
fqr the shops and for patients at the hos-
pitals, where women were giving birth to
babes, but Labor-unionism must have its
sport.
Before he left Australia, Cardinal
Macßory pronounced himself delighted
with the appearance and demeanor of
the workers (“they get more than double
the wages paid in Ireland”), but dis-
pleased with the refusal of subsidies to
church schools:
Ulster provides half the cost of Catholic
schools and full payment of teaching staffs.
The Free State pays full salaries of Pro-
testant teachers in denominational schools
and two-thirds of building and mainten-
ance costs.
Perhaps N.S.W. Labor will remedy what
the Cardinal proclaims an injustice.
Both N.S.W. factions have undertaken
to subsidise denominational schools,
though they don’t say much about it.
Parkhill is now Minister for Defence,
and it is suggested that “a senior army
officer from England” may be appointed
“to command the Australian forces for
a short period”—if the public will stand
it. No “senior army officer from Eng-
land” would be more acceptable to Aus-
tralians than Chauvel, White, Hobbs,
Glasgow, Rosenthal or Jess, but as these
soldiers are merely Australians perhaps
Mr. Parkhill has never heard of them.
The permanent head of the department
ought to be better informed, though he
spent the war period in the P.M.’s office
in Melbourne. Incidentally, the perma-
nent head gets £2OOO p.a., less £3OO
financial-emergency reduction. The salary
of the Chief of the General Staff is
£1479 p.a.
While the Butter Board boasts of hav-
ing spent £25,000 last year in assisting
sales in Britain, John Manifold, of
Camperdown (Vic.), tells that, during a
visit to London, he saw no Australian
butter in any store but Selfridge’s. There
was a “Buy Australian Butter” sign on a
wall of Australia House, but it did not
inform people where they could get it.
Manifold returned home with the im-
pression that most of our butter goes to
blenders.
If the Leg. Council hadn’t interfered,
a promoter of lotteries would now
be the highest-paid Westralian public
servant, apart from the Chief Jus-
tice and one or two more. The “Labor”
Government proposed to give one
of its comrades £IOOO a year to run
them. If the thing had gone through
the lottery man would be getting more
than any man in the Mines, Lands or
Law Departments—£24s a year more
than the Under-Secretary of Lands,
£335 more than the Government Geolo-
gist, £2OO more than the Chief Inspector
of Education, who has had 36 .years’
service.
The new freedom in Russia grows
more and more like the old tyranny; the
only material differences seem to be
that Lenin-worship has been substituted
for adoration of the Czar, and that poli-
tical prisoners are now shot in batches
after secret trial. Asa sequel to the assas-
sination of Kirov there have been anti-
Jewish outbreaks in Communist fac-
tories and exile to the snows for Zino-
vieff and Kameneff. Old stuff this, but
the shooting of 117 persons alleged to
have been concerned in the “plot” is a
Communist improvement.
Westralia’s Mitchell Government was
beaten because it abolished crossword
competitions for money prizes, the feeling
against it being worked up by the news-
papers that ran them. Sydney’s “Labor
Daily” apparently thinks that N.S.W.
electors can be likewise mobilised against
the Government that is squelching lottery-
share syndicates. Unfortunately, both
Labor groups have denounced the lottery-
share business. Lang himself said in Par-
liament that he was opposed to “allowing
certain individuals to make thousands of
pounds out of the sale of such shares.”
N.S.W. Railway Department’s Christ-
mas gift to inlanders was anew rate-
book. Goods rates on parcels weighing
from 2qr. to 2cwt. 3qr. are substantially
increased, especially on small lots ; the
charge for icwt. parcels to Dubbo and
Cootamundra, for instance, rises from
4s. to 4s. Bd. Perhaps nowhere else in
the world are inland freight rates going
up, but, it is a natural result of setting
up a Government railway monopoly and
letting it write laws to blot out motor
competition.
Canberra assures us that there is no
risk of the Ceylon malaria epidemic
spreading to Australia. Nevertheless,
N.Q. and the N.T. have endemic malarial
centres and have had severe outbreaks ;
one, introduced from Java, killed three-
fourths of the population of Burketown.
Queensland’s Forgan Smiths have done
wisely in employing the leading Aus-
tralian tropical-health expert, provided
they take his advice.

D, S. Aarons, the new N. S. Wales
g.m. of the Vacuum Oil Co., is an ex-
Digger. He collected an M.C. and bar
and a captaincy with the 16th Battalion.
He joined Vacuum Oil in W.A. in 1903,
and, except when 0.a.5., has been with
the big company ever since. He came to
Sydney, as assistant-g.m. from Melbourne
in ’32.
Howard Hinton’s 0.8. E. was the only
tribute paid to N. S. Wales art in the
Birthday List. He has been a trustee of
the Sydney Gallery for 15 years, and it is
well stocked with pictures presented by
him. He gave the Armidale Teachers’
College a large collection the other day.
English by birth, he arrived in Sydney in
the days of sailing-ships, and got a job
in a warehouse, having taught himself
shorthand and book-keeping during the
six months’ voyage.
The late Archbishop Redwood put up
many records in his toilsome life. When
Cardinal Manning consecrated him
Bishop of Wellington (M.L.) in 1874 he
was 35 and the youngest prelate in the
world ; on his death at 95 last week he
was the oldest. Born in England, he
arrived in M.L. with his parents at the
age of three ; he went on his travels again
at 15, when he left for France to study
for the priesthood, and he didn’t stop
travelling for any length of time after-
wards. What with journeys about his big
diocese, to Australia and to Europe he
had traversed more miles by the time he
died than any contemporary prelate. He
could also claim to have established a
record number of schools. Education
was one of his chief concerns ; he was a
member of the M.L. University Senate
for quarter of a century. His hobby
was violin-playing, and he owned a
Strad.
“Feminist”: Mrs. Alfred Deakin died
last week before her C.B.E. could be
conferred, so it has been gazetted “as
taking effect from December 29.” Why
her welfare work and saintly character
didn’t receive some public reward long
ago was a puzzle to all who knew her.
She took an active part in the Federation
campaign, and she was a figure to be
reckoned with in national politics for
quarter of a century afterwards. Her
father was one of Victoria’s first spiritual-
ists, she inherited his creed, and she was
first attracted to Deakin by the fact that
he was a fellow-believer.
“Lex”: The N. S. Wales Bar has re-
ceived the appointment of H. S. Nicholas
to the Equity side of the Supreme Court
Bench with approval; he is a fine lawyer
and a Constitutional authority. His
manner is diffident, almost shy, and he
rarely speaks unless he has something
fairly important to say. The public knows
practically nothing about Nicholas;
all his life he has shunned ballyhoo,
professional and social. He was born in
Tasmania, won a classical exhibition at
Oxford and was called to the London
Bar at the Inner Temple. He went in
for journalism while waiting for briefs
in Sydney early in the century, wrote a
textbook on Trusts, sat as N.S.W. Boun-
daries Commissioner and was appointed
to the reformed Council. His friends
call him “Nick,” and he is about the
most carelessly-dressed man who has
been appointed to an Australian Bench.
“Jeames”; The K.G. (the much-
prized order with “no d d merit about
it”) which was bestowed last week on
the Earl of Yarborough may be regarded
as a consolation prize. He has per-
formed no notable service of a public
nature since he was born 76 years ago.
But he has a grievance. His mother was
a daughter of the then Earl of Listowel,
and the present Earl of Listowel is virtu-
ally a Bolshie. The young man, who
looks and talks like a Wodehouse hero
(his aged kinsman being the replica of
a right-minded Wodehouse peer), got
himself disliked in Spain the other day
as an associate of Communists. The ill-
fated jaunt to the Continent, the agony
of the youthful enthusiast’s Conservative
relatives, the K.G. —it is a complete
Wodehouse plot in itself.
A. S. Kenyon, of Vic.’s Rivers and
Water Commission, goes on long leave
after just on half a century’s work
for irrigation. He has been associated
with £20,000,000 worth of water works.
He claims that no country but the U.S.A.
can compare with Vic, in irrigation sys-
tems.
Harry Budge is the first N. S. Wales
public servant to get a knighthood
as such. He was transferred from the
Chief Secretary’s Department to Gov-
ernment House 35 years ago, and he has
been official secretary to every Governor
since. All the vice-regalities praised his
HARRY BUDGE: Pioneer.
loyalty, tact and wisdom, and several —
notably Davidson and De Chair —tried to
get him knighted, but precedent stood in
the way. He has been involved in every
vice-regal crisis from the minor rows
caused by Sir Harry Rawson’s public ob-
jections to the R.A.N. to the conflicts
which ex-Premier Lang forced on his
would-be friend Sir Philip Game, and he
has never been accused of taking poli-
tical sides. When not placing his accu-
mulated wisdom and experience at the
disposal of Governors he concentrates
chiefly on church matters. He is a lay
canon of St. Andrew’s.
Colin Stephen would have got his
knighthood years ago if he had courted
the favor of politicians, but that is not his
way. As chairman of the A.J.C. since
1919 he has proved as businesslike as his
predecessor and brother-in-law, the late
Adrian Knox; and, though anything but
matey, he has a more agreeable manner.
He began with two qualifications: he
comes of a long line of stern but just
Judges, and he was an outstanding flat-
race rider 30-odd years ago, when the
standard of Australian horsemanship was
much higher than it is now. His father,
also a keen racing man, was “Seppy”
Stephen, son of the Chief Justice, grand-
son of one of Australia’s first Supreme
Court Judges, and partner in Stephen,
Jaques and Stephen—like the son. Con-
sett Stephen, the present head of the firm,
is Colin Stephen’s uncle, and Milner
Stephen, J., is a cousin.
“I. Temple” gossips:
Lord Hewart, who at 65 has married the lady
who nursed him through his recent illness, has
got into the news oftener than any L.C.J. of
modern times. He is as pugnacious as a bull-
dog, and looks it, being short and stocky and
the possessor of a brooding brow and heavy
jowl. Criminals dread him; likewise members
of the Bar who suffer from discursiveness. He
published “The New Despotism” four years
ago—a slashing attack on civil servants —and
his recent remarks on the Judicature Bill scan-
dalised the Lords by their violence. His first
wife dropped dead at a Mansion House party
about a year ago. He is the only English
Judge who has been made a member of the
United Service Club (a tribute presumably to
his civilian war work), and he is the only old
Oxonian on the Bench who doesn’t belong to
a university club.
John Perry, dead at 84, livened the
N. S. Wales Assembly up periodically
as member for Liverpool Plains, 1904-
1911. Morality was practically the only
plank of his platform. He battled tire-
lessly to have the Parliamentary refresh-
ment bar closed, and his candid com-
ments upon the drinking habits of indi-
vidual members brought him innumer-
able offers of fights—two of which he
accepted! Every Sunday in the Domain
he conducted a ceremonial burning of
newspapers which he regarded as dele-
terious to public morals. On the con-
structive side he was one of the founders
of the Farmers and Settlers’ Assoc.
“Docker”: Albert Hinchcliffe, who
died in Sydney at 74 last week, was a
typical early Laborite. A native of Man-
chester, he wouldn’t hear a word against
England or the English, and he dis-
approved of gambling and drink. He
had been a proselytising Rechabite since
boyhood. He founded Brisbane
“Worker” in 1904 and came to Sydney
in 1917 as manager of the “Australian
Worker.” A great old boy who knew
his mind and spoke it, heedless of fear
or favor, he enjoyed the respect and
affection of many youngsters in the
movement who couldn’t make him or
his ideals out.
“Whitehall”: It seems preposterous
that there should be a king named Zog,
but so it is, and he was duly bombed
last week. Zog accepted the throne of
Albania in 1928 after it had been refused
by several wary foreigners. I saw him
in Paris when he was Premier of his
homicidal native land, and could hardly
credit that one who looked so like a
mild little barber possessed the nerve
for his perilous job. The Albanians hate
practically everybody, especially Musso-
lini. Zog had already been bombed on
suspicion of pro-Italianism. Almost any-
body with £lO,OOO p.a. or over in real
money can reasonably aspire to the
throne of Albania, but the expectation of
life in the case of all but born bomb-
evaders is not much greater than that
of a front-line infantryman during a
war.
Sydney Scots College has a new prin-
cipal—Alex. Anderson, who has been
headmaster of a Presbyterian college in
Christchurch (M.L.) for the past 14 years.
He took his B.A. at Waitaki in 1914, and
his M.A. the following year; at the be-
ginning of 1918 he was given a lecture-
ship in his special subject—history— at
Otago Uni. Sports: football, tennis,
hockey and rifle-shooting. Hobby: the
cadet movement.
“Anglo-Roman”: Cardinal Bourne was
England’s ideal of what a Catholic prelate
should be. Like Newman, Manning and
Vaughan he had suave and charming
manners and was persona grata at Court
and in the Athenseum Club ; but, unlike
his predecessors, he kept almost entirely
aloof from politics. Church matters
apart, he only came before the general
public in connection with two issues—the
Education Act of his friend A. J. Bal-
four, which he opposed, and the war,
which he supported. Westminster Cathe-
dral, the huge Byzantine edifice off Vic-
toria-street, whose tower can be seen all
over London, is largely his work, though
it was begun by Cardinal Vaughan.
Bourne was English by birth, and his
genius as an organiser was first recog-
nised by Leo XIII., whose Domestic
Prelate he became over 40 years ago.
“Gigadibs”: At Guildford (N.S.W.) the
other day, Mrs. Sophia Jane Teage, aged
98, was photographed with her daughter,
granddaughter, great-granddaughter and
great-great-granddaughter. The greatest
number of generations in one family
known to have been living at one time
is seven, but five living generations is an
uncommon occurrence, and probably the
first of its sort for an Australian family.
Mrs. Teage is Australian-born, and in
her early days at Cathcart ticket-of-leave
men worked on her father’s property.
William Martin Mac Kay, adjutant of
the 13th Battalion (Maitland), was issued
with a M.B.E. in the New Year honors.
He has been connected with the army
for 25 years. Six days after the declara-
tion of war he enlisted, landing at Galli-
poli as a member of the 2nd Battalion.
Three days later he got his commission.
He was wounded at Lone Pine and pro-
moted to captain in France in T 6. After
the Armistice he was stationed at Lis-
more; then he went to Artarmon and
from there to Maitland, where he got his
majority.

“El V.”: The Commonwealth paid
£5OO “as a contribution towards the mis-
sionary expedition to Caledon Bay.” I
have the accounts of the party that made
the first double crossing of Australia via
the N.T. by motor-car —6900 miles in
the days when petrol had to be carried
1400 miles at one stage: Petrol and oil,
£Bl ; rations for three men, £94 ; equip-
ment and incidentals (including photo-
graphic materials and a camera, £29)
£B3 ; total, £258. We did ourselves well
and prepared for everything. I wish
somebody would make a contribution of
£5OO towards my going to Caledon either
by land or water.

“Dungeness”: Some Australians don’t
regard this England-Australia rapid air-
mail with any favorable eye. These dis-
affected citizens live mostly in the far
north-west, where the eye of Canberra
is quite dim; about Anthony’s Lagoon
and Alexandria, for example—one street
in a west-coast Tasmanian town would
balance them as voters. The old air mail
called at both: the new speedier one only
drops the packets. The result is that
they have to travel from 60 to 120 miles
to post an air letter. Delivery is excellent,
they admit—but a letter’s got to be re-
plied to, quite often. They are starting
a local subsidiary service, also by air.
Characteristically, too, they are not emit-
ting any cries for help from Canberra.
They, like their forebears, do things for
themselves.
“Physalia”: Bathing from a N.Q.
beach during the Christmas holidays, a
man lost his life from the sting of a
“bluebottle,” or Portuguese man-o’-war,
the “blue bubble with strings” which
blows ashore after n.-e. winds on lots of
Q. and northern N.S.W. beaches. A
number of bluebottle deaths have been
recorded, mainly children, and probably
quite a few more have been due to it.
Tentacles of the larger species run up to
12 feet long, and are lined with arrows
coiled in poison glands, which go off at
a touch. The pain is acute. A man swim-
ming and getting one of these coiled
round his body—they are only thread-
thick —would gasp enough air out of and
water into his lungs to sink like a stone.
Best first-aid is to rub the sting-marks
with sand—it breaks up the poisoned
arrows sticking into the surface. Then,
the ordinary bluebag.

“Vic”; While the south is soaked,
porth-west Queensland is in the grip
of a drought which compares with that
of 1902-03. The Barcoo country is bare ;
Tambo and Landsdowne are hand-
feeding their stud sheep ; big properties—
for instance, Terrick Terrick—are send-
ing their stock out on agistment.
During the year Blackall has had
only 13in. of rain, and the stock
market is dead. Around Winton it
is estimated that unless it rains within,
a fortnight 50 p.c. of the stock will be
lost. Big local waterholes have faded
out; sheep with seven months’ wool have
been offered to skin-buyers for next to
nothing. Some stations are shearing eight
months’ wool. The grasshoppers have
arrived in swarms, and having eaten out
large tracts are either passing on or dying
of starvation in millions. N.S.W. should
take warning. The dry area seems to
be moving south along the February rain
belt.
$ * * *
“Meter”: Brisbane’s new traffic ver-
botens would make Hitler green with
envy. It is forbidden to climb off the
footpath to enter a tram until the tram
has stopped—even the tramway authori-
ties are alarmed at this. Alighting from
a tram you must make a beeline to the
nearest footpath. If you desire to get to
the other side of the street you stroll
along till you find an intersection or
drafting-race marked out with white
lines and cross at right angles. Tram-
waymen must not ring their bells pass-
ing churches on Sunday morning except
in case of danger. Motor-cars coming
out of a side street must stop before
entering a main thoroughfare—this is a
good idea ; it is in vogue on all main
roads in Canada. And taxi fares have
been raised. They will now be Is. flag-
fall and 4d. for each third of a mile, with
“ ’Is Lordship’s compliments, hut 'e’s not kin.”
an extra 6d. per mile when there are
more than five passengers.
* ® * t-
“Vindex”: You effete southerners say
the grasshopper won’t eat ripe wheat.
Why, at Winton (Q.) he has stripped
fruit and fodder trees, and a local
camper reports that ’hoppers have
chewed up his “mattress, mosquito-
net and papers, and are dying in
thousands in consequence.” I am leav-
ing my income tax, land tax, pastoral-
rent demand, motor tax, rabbit tax and
about a ton of other Government re-
quests in the paddock in high hopes that
there will be dead locusts all over the
landscape next week.
* * * *
“Kwakprak”: A defendant in a main-
tenance case at Toowoomba (Q.), after
having paid 12s. a week since 1930,
applied for a magisterial order for a
blood-group test of the mother and child
in order to disprove paternity. The
magistrate refused it on the ground that
there is no law bearing on the subject
on the Queensland statute book. Never-
theless, it is now accepted that four
human blood groups exist, each of which
is fixed from birth and persists through-
out life. If both parents happen to be-
long to Group 4, they can only beget
children belonging % the same group.
Unions between or with other groups
are variable, probably (but not certainly)
on Mendelian lines. The facts relating
to Group 4 are definitely established,
and cover about 20 per cent, of all cases.
It is a fair inference that there is a chance
of paternity being definitely disproved in
about one case in five; and it seems
grossly unfair that defendants in main-
tenance and affiliation cases, together
with the parties in certain divorce cases,
should be deprived of even a 5-to-l
chance of clearing themselves from what
is charged against them. Several Euro-
pean countries have already passed legis-
lation to recognise the discoveries of
medical science on the subject of blood-
groiiping.
“Australia Jane’s” Budget
Lola Rouse, only daughter of the late
F. R. Rouse, a well-known pastoralist, and
of Mrs. Rouse, of Toowoomba, is among
the latest to wear an engagement ring.
The lad is Bill Parry-Okeden, elder son
of Mr. and Mrs. C. T. Parry-Okeden,
of Glenhaughton (Dawson River), and
grandson of the late W. S. Parry-Okeden,
once Queensland Police Commissioner.
Lola’s mother was a Clendinning from
the Downs.
Thelma Hadley has left by the Marella
for the Federated Malay States, where
she has an altar date with Adrian Dela-
more, of Kuala Lumpur.
“The nicest lot of girls I ever met,” is
Dot Waldron’s comment on the team of
English women cricketers. Dot is hon.
sec. of the Queensland Women’s Cricket
Association, and she accompanied the
visitors to Sydney. They travelled via
Wallangarra so that they might see
something of this State. Several parties
were arranged for the visitors, including
morning-tea at Bishopsbourne, at which
Mrs. Wand and her daughter Kathleen
were hostesses. The Queensland Women’s
Association also gave a dinner party at
the Carlton Hotel which was cheerful
and informal, and there were a trip to
Redland Bay for several of the girls and
a visit to Gatton College for a few others.
Mrs. Andrew Dunn, who will be re-
membered among Sydney Inky Wayfarers
as Miss M. Foote, is off to England and
Europe in the Oronsay. She is a capable
and versatile lady, and has taken a lead-
ing part in raising funds for several Bris-
bane charities.
The oldest pioneer woman in the Pitts-
worth district, Mrs. Sarah Mann, last
week joined her old friends across the
Big Divide at 79. She was the first white
woman and the first bride to live in the
North Branch area. She came to the
Downs when a child, and before she was
17 met and married her husband. She
reared a family of 13, married now, and
scattered over Australasia from Maori-
land to the Manning and from Umbiram
to Toowoomba.
The Dudley Pikes will join the Aorangi
for Maoriland, and thence go to Eng-
land via Panama,
Lady Wilson and her daughter had to
hasten back from the sea to be ready to
receive the Dowager Lady Swaythling,
who is doing a round of visits to Aus-
tralian Government Houses.
Mrs. Bertha Gearing, who used to be
Bertha Morrison, and whose creamy con-
tralto voice and Titian hair wrought
havoc in many a manly breast a few
years ago, is off to her home in Spain
after a round of visits to old friends.
Claire, the younger of the E. J. God-
sails’ two pretty daughters, has just an-
nounced her engagement to William
Stratford Sheldon, younger son of Dr.
and Mrs. Herbert Sheldon, of Granville,
N.S.W.
Bonny Mary Luya, recently back from
a trip to England and Europe, is another
newly-engaged lass. She is the daughter
of the late Harry
Luya and of Mrs.
Luya, of South Bris-
bane, and the young
man is Geoffrey
Gregory, from Mel-
bourne.
The only daughter
of the H. Strachans,
of Clayfield, also has
a new diamond ring
—from Frank Muir-
head, only son of
the late F. R. Muir-
head and of Mrs.
Muirhead, of Edin-
burgh.
Lieut.-Colonel E.
C. C. Plant (vice-
president) and Mrs.
Plant received the
guests at the in-
formal party arranged by the mem-
bers of the United Service Club to
see the New Year in. There was
bridge for those who preferred : t,
and dancing upstairs in the ball-
room, which was gay with balloons
and streamers. A frilly frock of
Patou pink was worn by Mrs. Plant;
Engineer Lieut.-Commander H. S. Platt
looked after the dancers. The programme
included service medleys, and some of
our heavy dragoons showed themselves
remarkably fleet of foot.

There is £2,285,000 of capital to feed in
400,000 A 6 p.c. and 450,000 B 5 p.c.
cum. prefs., 935,000 C 2\ p.c. non-cumu-
lative participating prefs. and 500,000
ords. All shares rank in the order stated
for capital and dividends. The outlook
for the A and B shares, in which the
public is interested, has lost much of its
recent drabness. The C and ord. shares
are held by Fox Films, of U.S.A., which
bought them in 1931 ; it also put up
£ 170,000-odd on a second debenture to
help ease the strain on finances caused
by the lavish building programme, due to
competition with the Union group.
At June 30, 1933, there was £222,000
coming to the prefs. in accrued divs. —
As £96,000 and B’s £126,000. From that
date the rates of dividend on these (each
formerly carried 8 p.c.) were reduced to
the figures already stated. Thus, the A
and B shares together now call for
£46,500 p.a., or £19,500 less than they
used to. There is another £4950 of
guaranteed divs., making total cumulative
preference claims £51,450 p.a. Next the
C shares, which used to carry a non-
cumulative 10 p.c., are entitled to 2\
p.c., equal to £23,375. After that, £lO,OOO
of any year’s remaining profit, or so much
as the co. can afford, is to be used to
reduce arrears of pref. divs., A’s first and
B s next. Then the C’s come into the
picture again for another 2\ p.c. If there
is anything left one half is to be divided
equally between the A and B shares until
8 p.c. has been reached ; the other half
belongs firstly to the C’s until they have
had a total of 10 p.c., and the balance
to the ords.
To give the A and B shares their mini-
mum requirements, plus £lO,OOO towards
reduction of arrears, and pay guaranteed
divs. and 5 p.c. on the C shares would
call for £108,200 altogether, or more than
double last year’s net earnings. The
further participating rights of the A and
B shares, therefore, do not appear to be
worth much at the moment.
Early in 1933 Hoyts and Union
formed General Theatres Corp., which
merged the city interests of the pair
extended the field for Fox films and
helped to reduce overhead by elimi-
nating extravagant competition—and
the bank smiled. The reduction in
interest rates and taxation (the Federal
entertainment tax was abolished) has
helped, too, while the revival of spending
gave takings a lift. After setting aside
£68,899 for depreciation, last year’s net
earnings were double the ’33 figure, but
only £1352 more than the guaranteed
divs. and 6 p.c. and 5 p.c. on the A and
B shares respectively called for. That is
disregarding an unexplained reduction of
£10,981 in nominal reserves, and a trad-
ing loss of £10,398 in one of the sub-
sidiaries.
There was a marked improvement in
the parent’s financial position:

outside liabilities over more or less liquids
was reduced from £186,862 to £71,543
°. v ] er /he twelvemonth. Shares in sub-
sidiaries, etc., is the most doubtful item.
Still, unlike Union, the co. puts its
cards on the table. A consolidated sheet
shows tangible assets with a book value
of £2,437,188, of which £2,359,800 was
represented by freeholds, leaseholds and
plant, etc. Including the tax reserve
(£64,780), outside liabilities figured at
£1,269,039 (down £104,546), leaving net
tangibles at £1,168,149. Since the close
ot accounts one of the pups. Electric
Theatres, made a capital loss of £72,949
on sale of a Bourke-street, Melbourne,
freehold. Its chief remaining asset is a
half-share in a George-street, Sydney,
property, subject to an overdraft in ex.-
cess of its present value. As guarantor
the parent expects to foot the bill. By
arrangement, however, this is not to
stand in the way of its own A and B pref.
divs.
The market prices the A’s at 19s. 3d.
and the B’s at 14s. 9d., at which figures
the return is 6.2 p.c. and 6.7 p.c. on a 6

As consumers of current the public in
S. Aus. is widely interested in this co.’s
figures. Its charges are governed by
interest and divs. on the share and bor-
rowed capital, allowances for deprecia-
tion, etc., and the cost of generation and
distribution. The share and debenture
capital is made up as follows:

The lot totals £4,272,753, down £350,000,
that amount of p.c. debentures having
been redeemed during the year ; the sav-
ing in interest and sinking fund payments
amounts to £23,500 p.a. The co.’s total
funds (capital, reserves and debentures)
now cost on the average a shade under
6 p.c. ; a moderate figure considering the
rapid expansion of the business during
the period of dear money. Following the
decision of the House of Lords that the
co.’s shareholders outside Australia were
entitled to payment of divs. only in
Australian currency, there was an all-
round reduction in charges to consumers
amounting to £30,000 p.a.
For 26 years to the close of accounts
in 1931, allowances for sinking funds,
etc., averaged 2.14 p.c. on capital. The
amount actually written off to the end
of August last was £778,278, mostly on
account of obsolescence during the last
decade. Thirty years ago it cost 10s. 6d.
to burn a 50-candlepower lamp for 100
hours ; now the cost is 3s. 3d., thanks to
mechanical and other developments
affecting costs.

The growth of £39,870 in exes, is due to

ance was previously made. After deduct-
ing debenture interest (£77,779) and
allowing for reserve adjustments, there
was £132,969 more than the pref divs
and 10 p.c. to the ords. called for; but
no specific allowance is made for depre-
ciation. There has been a steady increase
m consumption since the close of
accounts.
During the year £76,732 was spent on

The P.D.S., formed in 1925, amalga-
mated the Coastal Farmers’ and Berrima
cos., two pioneers of co-operative mar-
keting in N. S. Wales. It has done good
work for the producer by handling his
produce at low cost and by helping to
organise more orderly marketing of his
products, both locally and overseas. The
formation of two co-operative selling-
houses in London—Overseas Farmers’
Co-op. Federations and Empire Dairies
—has meant much for Australian pro-
ducers, who now sell about 75 p.c. of
their butter output overseas. With the
aid of the tariff the balance is sold locally
at a fixed price of 140 s. per cwt., thus
ensuring a better average return to the
grower than would otherwise be possible.
Incidentally, under the equalisation
scheme, which has supplanted the Patter-
son levy, above or below quota sales on
the local market are adjusted to the
general average of all sales.
Despite expanding production, there
was a steady contraction in the value of
the co.’s turnover for the five years to
Sept. 30, 1933, due to falling prices:

Last year more butter, bacon, potatoes
and fruit were handled at £2946 less
cost; prices were steadier, turnover
sprang £77,587, and commission earn-
ings, etc., benefited by £6983 of the in-
crease. Including an unexplained reduc-
tion of £650 in goodwill (£BOOO, down
£6650, not treated as an asset herein), the
net result was £10,579 better at 11.3 p.c.
on capital as against 6.1 p.c. and 4.3 p.c.
for the two preceding years. Half a
point was added to the div., making it
P-c., and 10 p.c. (= £7233) of the com-
mission on local sales of butter, bacon
and cheese was rebated to consignors,
who are practically all shareholders.
There is nothing about the finances to
cause anxiety:

(£129,536) was £20,748 stronger than at
the previous balance. When the books
closed the amount coming to consignors
(£158,987) was equal to less than a fort-
night’s supplies.
The immediate outlook favors a
further increase in production, and
Christmas demand brought a sharp rise
of ss. per cwt. in the London price of
Australian choicest, making it 755.. worth
about 775. 9d. to the Australian pro-
ducer, after allowing for exchange, etc.

The lamb-and-mutton freezing and ex-
port trade is a tricky business. In the
crowded Canterbury (M.L.) markets,
where the co. buys most of its live-
stock, competition is very keen, while at
Smithfield (Eng.), where it sells most of
its products, it has to compete with
Argentine exporters. There is thus a
wide opportunity for price fluctuations
to play havoc with earnings, as the ’29
and ’3O figures illustrate. Still, the co.
was able to live upon the fat it had ac-
cumulated ; distributions to the ords.
(they averaged 11.2 p.c. for the II years
to the end of November, 1928) never
dropped below 5 p.c.
For the five years to the close of ac-
counts in 1933 there was a steady growth
in the quantity of lamb and mutton ex-
ported, costs were lowered and as over-
seas prices strengthened so did earnings.
During the last term the co. was able to
sell much of its current production plus
stocks on hand at the end of November,
1933, while prices were at their best —they
eased toward the end of the last term.
Net earnings, which sprang £Bl2B, were
the second-best on record. Allowing for
the pref. div., reduced by statute to 5 p.c.
till Nov. 30 next, and for the larger-than-
usual expenditure on replacements, etc.,
shown as written off in th'e table, enough
remained to show 22.5 p.c. on the
£112,500 of ord. capital, as against 26.4
p.c. and 5.4 p.c. for the two preceding
terms. The div. was kept at 7 p.c.,
and £17,479 was visibly added to the lay-
by.
Here is the skeleton of the business as
balance-sheet figures reveal it:

Although the works have recently been
brought up to date, £25,163 more was
written off than was spent on fixed assets
last year—at that rate they would be
practically written out of the books in
ten years. Liabilities, down £29,786, in-
clude an unspecified amount for contin-
gencies.
The market notes the margin between
earnings and distributions, and prices the
fully-paid £5 prefs. at £5 18s., the £lO
ords. paid to £7 10s. at £lO 10s. At these
prices the return is 4.5 p.c. and 5 p.c. re-
spectively on the basis of last year’s dis-
tributions.

This is the co. through which Uptons,
Ltd., M. O’Riordan and Sons and the
Alston Soap and Candle Co. merged
their interests in the middle of 1929. The
public put up £40,000 of 8 p.c. pref.
money, with priority as to capital and
divs., making paid capital £179,509. With
the change in conditions, which brought
keener competition and price-cutting, the
co. soon found itself in deep water;
much deeper than the published figures
suggested. Half-way through the last
term assets were revalued, £23,761 was
struck off the book value of freehold
and plant, £16,325 off debtors’ balances,
etc., and £lOO6 off stocks. All this, a
trading loss of £2990 and £226 of sun-
dry exes, added £44,308 to intangibles,
raising them to £89,754, equal to 10s. per
ord. share at the end of 1933. That was
after £19,793 reserved for depreciation,
etc., disappeared without comment.
To clean the slate, half the ord. capi-
tal has been jettisoned, reducing it tc;
£89,754 in 10s. shares. Also, the pref.
div. was reduced from 8 p.c. to 5 p.c.
cumulative from July 1, 1932, with the
right to advance to 8 p.c. again {less
22\ p.c. while the N. S. Wales Interest
Reduction Act remains in force) on a
pro rata basis with the ords., after the
latter have had Is. per share. For the
prefs. to receive £2480 ( = 6.2 p.c.) the
ords. will need to get £10,052 (=11.2
p.c.), together £12,532, or £3812 more
than the annual rate of net earnings for
the six months to June 30 last. The
£4360 netted for that period enabled the
co. to clean the prefs.’ slate and put
£360 on the shelf. Prospects depend
largely upon the development of pro-
prietary lines and the course of competi-
tion, which, at the moment, promises to
remain very keen.
Capital had not been actually written
off when the books closed, though other

Appearances are that the reserve for

used to further reduce the book value
of freehold and plant (down £43,229). A
net reduction of £19,028 in stocks en-
abled £18,452 to be lopped off the over-
draft (£4801). Including stocks, more or
less liquids (£70,787) exceeded the out-
side debt by £47,652 when the books
closed.
At 21s. (15s. 3d. a year ago) the prefs.
return 4.7 p.c. on a 5 p.c. div. basis. The
cover is £3 ss. in net tangibles.

The Goldmining Grant
In the ’nineties, when prices collapsed
and British investors looked askance at
Australian public and private securities,
increased gold production helped to fill
the gap in exports and take up the slack
in employment. It promises to play a
similar part in 1935, and probably for
many years afterwards, thanks to the big
rise in the commodity value of the metal
and to improvements in recovery and
other processes, all of which have greatly
increased our discovered and undiscov-
ered reserves of pay-ore and led to a
revival of the industry.
To further liven the process, the Com-
monwealth Government has made a
grant of £403,000 to supplement assist-
ance extended by States to prospectors
and others. In return the States have
undertaken to find employment for an
extra 5550 men—N.S.W., 1000; Vic,
1100; S. Aus, 250; W.A, 1100; Tas,
450; N.T, 650. Over the last three
years, the States have spent an aggre-
gate of £582,650 in connection with
mining activities, and the results have
been worth while, thanks largely to the
good work done by Government mining
engineers and geologists, who will direct
activities to be financed by the Federal
grant.
New Mining Awards
The weekly paybags of metalliferous
miners in Westralia, Vic. and N. S.
Wales will be a little heavier in 1935 than
they were in 1934. Also, surface workers
will toil 44 hours, the same as those
underground, except in Vic, where sur-
face hands will remain on the job for
48 hours, as before. Still, the concession
has produced a new bone of contention
in Westralia, where the men object to
working alternate 40-hour and 48-hour
weeks.
In Westralia an “industry allowance”
of 2s. a week for each 10s. rise in the
price of gold above £5 10s. a fine ounce,
based on the average price for the pre-
ceding quarter, is payable. With gold at
its present price, this means an extra 12s.
a week. But the cos. are already paying
4s. above the basic wage (£4 25.), so the
actual increase is Bs. ; at Wiluna it is
6s, owing to a reduction of 2s. in the dis-
trict allowance (now 10s.). In addition,
all underground workers are to get an
extra 3s. per week.
In Vic. the new award is in part settle-
ment of an inter-State dispute ; the Tas-
manian portion of the case has yet to be
heard. A minimum wage of £3 Is. a
week has been declared, except for
Gippsland (as defined by the award),
where it is £3 4s. Underground workers,
who used to draw the same classified
rates as surface hands, now get an extra
3s. per week, while the old difference of
3s. a week between the rates for quartz
and alluvial mining has disappeared.
Also, learners can be employed, one for
every three miners, at ss. a week below
the miners’ wage.
Except at Broken Hill, the new basic
wage for the industry in N. S. Wales is
£3 12s. 6d. a week —6d. more than the old
rate, and ss. above the State living wage
—with an extra shilling for those under-
ground.
The awards are for three years in N.
S Wales, two in Vic. and two in West-
ralia, where either party can apply for
a variation after 12 months. With the
exception of small low-grade proposi-
tions, the effect upon dividend prospects
is not likely to amount to much.
Large supplies of comparatively high-
grade metamorphic amorphous graphite
are believed to be available near Collins-
ville, on the Bowen (Q.) coalfield.
until a market can be found further ex-
penditure on underground exploration
and the development of reserves is not
recommended, says L. C. Ball, the State’s
Chief Government Geologist. Amor-
phous graphite is used in pencil, paint,
foundry facing and stove polish manufac-
ture. It is not a rare mineral; the
world’s annual consumption has seldom
exceeded 150,000 tons.
* * * «
Prospecting north of Mt. Coolon (Q.)
has revealed silicification of the Lower
Bowen volcanic series over a small area.
Here gold occurs in a chalcedonic quartz
network, but the value of the bullion is
low, owing to the presence of silver.
On only one reef, the Wonga, worked
by Kermode Bros, has the mill yield
enabled production to continue. Gold
was first found in this locality by J.
Wright in 1928.

For the five months to Nov. 30 Day
Dawn (New Guinea), whose mill was
the first to operate in the territory,
crushed 6899 tons for 31210 z. of gold,
which fetched £ll,OOO. Exes, took £8485,
leaving £2515 net. The cyanide plant has
been given a trial run, and will set in
on the 36,000 tons of tailings, expected
to yield a profit of around 30s. a ton,
any day now. To test the value of four
lodes further down, the shaft is to be
deepened a further 150 ft. and crosscuts
driven. Estimates for a hydro-electric
plant are under consideration.

Yellowdine’s star, one of the brightest
in Westralia’s golden sky, is still ascend-
ing. Ore exposed and indicated at
several points to a vertical depth of 50ft.
and over a considerable length is suffi-
cient to warrant installation of a treat-
ment plant. Londoners interested are
expected to give this matter early at-
tention. Rock drills are an urgent
need; shaft-sinking in hard stone is
slowing down development. The Yel-
lowdine holds more than a mile on
the line of known gold-carrying for-
mations. Of its seven areas, only
three, which do not include the original
find (Palmers), are being developed. A
number of promising surface outcrops on
the remaining four areas await further
prospecting. Western Mining Corp. is
vigorously prospecting ground adjoining
Yellowdine’s.

Australian Mining Trust has unwatered
the Celebration, Hampton (W.A.), to
No. 4 level, where stone 4ft. to lift,
wide, assaying from 595. to 745., is ex-
posed in the north drive, with the face
still in ore at 130 ft. from the shaft. In
the south drive, a 4ft. to sft. body, assay-
ing 445. to 605., has been traced for 165 ft.
There is about 60,000 tons immediately
available for sloping. No. 5 level, where
the drill disclosed a 6ft. lode of 4dwt.
2gr. stuff, is being unwatered. At Meeka-
tharra the unwatering of the Ingliston and
Commodore by the Forsayth co. has
been slower than was anticipated owing
to shaft repair work. Values are based
on gold at £8 an ounce (Aus.).

Boulder Perseverance jogs along.
November profit at £10,473 was the best
for a long time, but the quantity treated
by the enlarged plant has not yet reached
the promised 8000-ton-per-month mark.
After the noteholders have received their
whack, this year’s profit should be ample
to repeat a 30 p.c. div. on the Is. shares.

South Kalguri has announced an in-
terim Is. per share (= £12,500), payable
this month. Last year an interim Is.
was followed by a final Is. 6d. and bonus
of 2s. 6d., altogether £62,501. The mine
still has years of profitable existence
ahead of it.

Gold Fields Australian Development,
formed in 1932 with a capital of £300,000
to acquire from Claude de Bernales the
Moonlight and other groups at Wiluna
(W.A.), is all right, says chairman J. A.
Agnew. Good borehole developments in
the Moonlight and exposure of ore of
high average value at depth are the
grounds on which he justifies the con-
clusion. The co. has just raised £200,000
additional capital.

Star Exploration’s investments are
given a book value of £107,000. The
portfolio includes shares in Lake View,'
Wiluna, Bulolo, Gold Mines of Aust. and
an assortment of S. African stocks. This
lot, which accounts for about 53 p.c. of
the co.’s investments, is worth 16 p.c.
more than book value. Of the remain-
ing investments, 27 p.c. is financial, trust,
land and utility concerns, and the balance
base metals.

Adelaide interests represented by
Michael Terry claim ounce results from
one shoot and a lenticular patch of high-
grade stuff in another place in the Cosmo
Newberry range, north-east of Laverton
(W.A.). These ridges have been tried
before, but proved unattractive.
BRIEF ANSWERS.
R.A.M.; (1) Section 246 of the N. S.
Wales Act says: “A general meeting of every
company registered under this Act shall be held
once at least in every year.” . (2) As for the
balance sheet, everything depends upon what
the Articles of Association say. (3) In default
of any rules or regulations on the subject,
five members shall be competent to summon a
meeting. The bill now before Parliament seeks
to remedy many of the defects of the old Act.
.. ..T.P.8.: (1) Both seem likely to further
appreciate. (2) Mt. Morgan. (3) Yes. (4)
Lancefield or Rothsay... J.E.D.: (1) While the
co. has the field to itself, yes. (2) A stock
with immediate prospects, but needs watching.
(3) No. (4) and (5) Last reduction of deposit
rates due to pressure of shortest-dated funds.
No immediate prospect of rise in interest rates,
which appear to be about bedrock. Market
will be chiefly influenced by earning capacity
and financial position... .Gil.: (1) See B.
26 /12 / ’34. (2) A fair prospect. (3), (4) and
(5) Doubtful... .S.C.: Is interested with parent
(Gold Mines of Aus.) in New Morning Star,
Napoleon and other shows; exact holdings not
yet announced... .T.A.; (1) and (2) Both doubt-
ful.... W.C.: Subject to the possibilities of
Government interference, a sound swap
Emilian; If safety of capital is important,
look the other way... .L.M.: The capital struc-
ture looks a bit top-heavy.

“Now and Forever”
Present critic agrees with his Mel-
bourne colleague’s praise of Shirley
Temple’s performance in the above,
which arrived at the Prince Edward on
Friday. Her distress on learning that
Gary Cooper has lied to her about the
stolen jewels is astonishing in a child
of five or less. The episode should win
many a tear from the eye of sentimental-
ism ; but how absurd it is! Five-year-
olds don’t get upset when a grown-up
substitutes fancy for fact; they live in a
world of make-believe. The implied
reason for Shirley’s grief is the realisation
that her father stole the necklace, and
this is equally absurd. Babies have a
sense of property as regards their own
possessions, but they can watch appalling
things being done to the dolls, bikes, etc.,
of others with Olympian calm. Gary’s
trouble with Shirley in real life would
have been to jolly her into giving up the
necklace without howls of prptest. She
would have regarded it as accruing to
herself by reason of its discovery inside
her teddy-bear.
Sir Guy Standing’s suave wrong-’un—
always just a little too polite and genial—
will be appreciated by travellers. Pursers
on luxury liners spend a good deal of
their lives warning passengers against
ingratiating customers of the sort. The
only other interpretation worth mention-
ing is also given by a veteran —Charlotte
Granville, who is right to the last detail
as the good-natured worldling whom
Cooper robs.
“Kiss and Make Up”
One of those extravagant gibes at the
follies of the idle rich in which Holly-
wood leads the world.
Cary Grant is a super-beautician. He
rejuvenates Genevieve Tobin, to the
despair of her husband, Eddie Horton,
who realises that no ordinary man can
hold so much synthetic loveliness. Grant
marries Miss Tobin after the divorce,
and is inexplicably surprised to find that
most of her time is monopolised by
physical alterations and repairs. Yearn-
ing for him in the background is his
stenog., Helen Mack, who can afford
to scorn aids to beauty. Everything
likely to please has been dragged in—
social satire, a leg-show, comedy in the
familiar Horton vein, pashun (Grant-
Tobin), sentiment (Grant-Mack), a wild
car-chase ending in a smash —and it is all
done at top speed and in the highest
spirits. Helen Mack introduces some
human touches to the extravaganza.
“Fugitive Lady”
Don’t be deceived by the Lonsdaleish
title of this Plaza film; it is our old
stage friend ‘The World Against Her.”
Florence Rice plays the ingenue who is
thrown to the wolves of unemployment
by the machinations of a villainess. A
burglar (Donald Cook) wins the maiden’s
love, but basely deserts her when the
police arrive, leaving an incriminating
collection of stolen jewels in her suit-
case. So she gets five years. The train
to the penitentiary is wrecked; the
villainess before-mentioned (wife of the
hero, Neil Hamilton) is killed, and the
unconscious heroine is mistaken for
deceased and put to bed in the palatial
home of the hero’s doting mother.
Any experienced playgoer can fill in
the rest —the dawn of love ; the senti-
mental twitterings of the hero’s mother
and aunt, who hadn’t met his wife and
are unable to understand why he should
have quarrelled with such an enchanting
being; the delicate situations; the
arrival of Donald Cook, the real wife’s
disreputable brother, and the police ; the
denouement, with Virtue vindicated and
Vice being marched off to prison.
Where Miss Rice gets her exquisite
clothes from is a puzzle, but she is more
natural otherwise than any melodrama
heroine the writer has seen, and the
hero’s degraded brother-in-law (name
undiscoverable) is superb as the comic
villain.
“The Affairs of Cellini”
There is no attempt here to reproduce
the dignified atmosphere of a Florentine
Court; the film is simply a Palais Royal
farce played by Americans in sixteenth-
century costumes. The beginning is
tedious, but after the appearance of
Fredric March as Cellini there are few
dull moments. Frank Morgan makes
the Duke the traditional Gallic cuckold
—a fussy imbecile who is betrayed by
everybody. Constance Bennett is his
flighty yet sinister Duchess. The com-
plications arise from her pursuit of the
reluctant Cellini and the Duke’s senile
attentions to Cellini’s moron model. Fay
Wray.
March’s Cellini is the only character-
study which isn’t out of stock. He has
the voice and bearing of a man of the
people, yet his picturesque appearance
and irresponsible goings-on make the in-
fatuation of the Duchess understandable.
“DIE FLEDERMAUS,” AT SYDNEY NEW TIV.
(Top to bottom, left to right): Appleton Moore as Frosch the warder; Ben
Williams as Herr von Eisenstein; Gwladys Garside as Prince Orlofsky; Booth
Hitchen as gaol governor.
The settings are lavish, and great atten-
tion has been paid to the period furni-
ture and dresses.
“I Give My Love”
Vicki Baum’s melodramatic novel
done into a talkie, with Paul Lukas and
Wynne Gibson as the artist and his
sorely-persecuted sweetie. Lukas’s
broken English and Miss Gibson’s
sloppily-enunciated Bowery make the
dialogue difficult to follow, and much of
it isn’t worth following, anyhow. The
artists’-model heroine, sent to gaol for
ten years for killing her husband, leaves
her baby hoy in the care of Lukas.
When she comes out her spoilt son
strenuously objects to her marrying his
foster father, so she goes sorrowfully and
secretly out into the cold, cruel world,
and crops up in Paris, much addicted to
gin, ten years later. The son, now an
artist, runs across her and uses her as
a model for a picture, “Defeat” —a work
which looks as if it had been executed
by the baser kind of pavement artist.
However, it gets hung on the line at the
Salon, and its perpetrator generously
alters the title to “Sacrifice” when he
discovers the identity of the sitter.
Fade-out of Lukas and Miss Gibson in-
dulging in a long and presumably
juniper-flavored kiss. At the Capitol.
“Bitter Sweet”
“Those who saw “Bitter Sweet” on, the
stage will be disappointed with the screen
version at Sydney Mayfair. The “Green
Carnation” and “Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay”
and the whole of the last act, depicting
Sarah’s rise as an operatic singer, have
been chopped out. What is left of the
original lacks dash, variety and piquancy.
Anna Neagle is a sweet-voiced Sarah,
but she has many stage mannerisms. Fer-
nand Graavey is good as the musician
Carl. So are Esme Percy (Hugh Devon),
Miles Mander (Capt. von Lutte), Kay
Hammond (Gussi), Ivy St. Helier and
Clifford Heatherley.
“Beyond Bengal”
This jungle film at Sydney Lyceum
was shot in Malaya. It is weakened by
a crude love theme, but for stark ferocity
it outdoes any previous effort of the kind.
Amongst other horrors one sees huge alli-
gators relentlessly overtaking and mauling
swimming natives. The shots of wild
elephants, pythons, tigers, leopards and,
above all, the loathsome alligators are
unique. The spearing of a ’gator by two
natives neck-deep in water, the battle
between three of these brutes and three
Malays in a canoe, and, best of all, the
cool 100 per cent efficiency of the native
marksman who drops charging tigers and
leopards unerringly at his feet are thrill-
ing. Also revolting.
“The Blue Squadron*’
John Stuart and Esmond Knight ar-
Italian flying-officers, and Greta Hansen
stands at the apex of a triangle of love
and jealousy. The theme, however i s
of secondary interest to the photography.
There are acres of parked ’planes and a
skyful of squadrons in formation, a
large-scale aerial attack on Milan and
Spezzia, with defence ’planes blanketing
the cities with smoke, a crash in the snow-
bound Alps and a rescue by a ’plane
fitted with skis. Also at the Lyceum.
Some First Nights
The Fuller co.’s first performance in
Sydney of “Madame Butterfly” (a matinee
affair) suffered by comparison with the
Williamson-Imperial co.’s version, in
which the title role was in the Puccini-
selected hands of Signora Valobra. Fran-
cesca Duret, while sufficiently petite and
wistful, seemed not ideally cast as Cio-
Cio-San, and there was a lack of the con-
vincing touch in various other depart-
ments. The second cut at the opera, with
an altered cast, was very much more suc-
cessful. In Ben Williams, who took the
part of Pinkerton, the Fuller organisa-
tion has that rare combination an actor
and a singer. His leaven worked so
powerfully that the whole performance
was lifted from tolerable to excellent.
Miss Duret was still Butterfly, but with
such effective co-operation she sparkled
where before she had only twinkled, and
the beautiful stage settings devised by
producer Charles Moor gained a new
significance. Opera, to a greater degree
than most other forms of stage entertain-
ment, suffers tremendously through weak
links, a fact strikingly exemplified in
these two “Butterfly” performances.
* * *
Wagner’s frosty Northland, with its
ice-capped mountains, came to the stage
of Sydney New Tiv. on a sweltering
summer night, and the brows of more
than one of the principals, attired as they
were to withstand the rigors of the Scan-
dinavian winter, were wet with honest
sweat before Sieglinde had doped her
husband’s beer. Honors of the per-
formance, which musically and in stage
setting and costuming was of an impres-
sively high standard, lay with Walter
Widdop (Siegmund) and Muriel Brunskill
(Fricka). Madame Austral’s voice was
not at its best until near the end of the
last act, though her celebrated battle-cry
was rewarded with applause which oblit-
erated some of the subsequent singing.
Horace Stevens was Wotan, and invested
the part with as much Olympian dignity
as may be achieved by a god who is
not only henpecked but fast becoming
bankrupt of deity. Norman Allin’s deep-
voiced Hunding provided an effective
vocal foil for the tenor and the women’s
voices, and the'eight Australian Val-
kyries; who sistered Austral’s Brunnhilde
were, by all accounts, a better-looking
octet than is usually assembled at Bay-
reuth, while their voices were all that
could be asked for. Orchestra, under
de Abravanel’s baton, was worked up to
its climaxes skilfully, and the barbaric
grandeur of Wagner’s long-drawn-out
apostrophes was apparent to any sort of
an ear. But for the Australian taste and
climate these “Ring” operas are too long.
* * *
“The Old Folks at Home,” presented
at Melb, Comedy with the same cast as
in Sydney, is filled with characterisations
false as those of old-time melodramas.
The plot turns on a notion as fantastic
as that which Barrie presented in “What
Every Woman Knows”: a woman dis-
covering a love affair, so far physically
innocent, developing between her son’s
wife and a posturing author so arranges
matters as to make it a physically guilty
one in order to convince the young
woman that her husband is her true
mate and leave them happy ever after.
Yet the dialogue sparkles, and there is
not a line in the play that has not at
least one meaning. Grace Lane, Jane
Wood, Gerald Savory and Harvey
Adams extract the last ounce out of the
principal parts, but the show leaves one
longing for the purer atmosphere which
surrounds Mae West and Jean Harlow.

Dainty, shapely and pert, Phyllis
Baker is practically the whole outfit in

Like “Collits’ Inn,” “The Cedar Tree,”
the new Australian musicomedy at Mel-
bourne Princess, goes back a hundred
years. It takes its name from the Cedar
Tree shipyard on the Hawkesbury River,
and on this central point pivots a
romance rather more convincing and
coherent than those that form the basis
of imported musical plays. The book is
by Edmund Barclay and the lyrics, some
of which are very bright, by Helen Bar-
clay. As in “Collits’ Inn,” the music is
by Mrs. Varney Monk, and comprises
several tuneful numbers, notably “Coo-
ee” and “How I Love you,” sung by
Gladys Moncrieff, and “I’d Like to Be a
Statue in the Park,” a duet for Phyllis
Baker and Alfred Frith. The actors men-
tioned, together with Russell Scott,
Claude Flemming, Ashton Jarry and Byrl
Walkley, acquit themselves with credit,
but the honors go to the dances arranged
by Jennie Brenan, especially the remark-
able bush ballet with child dancers.

The small and intimate Torch Theatre
in Adelaide, which opened with “Salome,”
ended its season, equally ambitiously, with
the “Medea” of Euripides. The whole
affair is mainly an idea of Patricia
Hackett (of the Perth family, but
now an Adelaide lawyer), and this
gloomy, unsparing tragedy gave ample
scope to her remarkable powers.
Miss Hackett dominated the scene
throughout; and she had sound help
from Harford, Mathews, Stella Sobels
and Oscar Cox as an effective if
not princely Jason. These young moderns
have no doubt at all about the case
Meaning v. Metre. They give it to the
former every time, with costs against
Gilbert Murray’s rhymed couplets. And
somehow —since nobody really does talk
in rhyme-—this makes the pleading and
the cursing seem more natural.
* * *
Ferenc Molnar’s play “Olympia,” pro-
duced by the Modern Theatre players
for the first time in Australia at the Uni-
tarian Hall, Melbourne, is almost a pro-
paganda drama. The audience can read
between the lines the hatred of a patriotic
Hungarian for the Austrian oppressor,
his contempt for monarchy, his resent-
ment against the “upper classes” gener-
ally. Nearly everybody in the play is
a super-silvertail and a rotter.
The plot turns on the awful dis-
covery that the heroine, widow of a
minor ruler, and herself a little sister
of the monarch, has fallen in love with
a mere captain, the son of a peasant.
She loves him, but she cannot bring dis-
grace on the long line of ancestors by
marrying him. When her mother points
this out she realises it at once ; but she
goes further —she accepts her mother’s
reasoning that he cannot even become a
lover “in the Continental sense.” So she
heaps insults on the man, and drives him
from her. Then in walks a police official
to inform them both that the supposed
captain they have admitted to their
charmed circle is an international crook
who is wanted in half a dozen countries,
and whose specialty is blackmail. The
mother is prostrated ; there is only one
thing to be done. The daughter must
close his mouth by accepting him as a
lover “in the Continental sense.” After-
wards the horrible truth is revealed that
the captain is not a crook but a miserable
peasant after all. The humiliation of
everybody is beyond belief; the girl‘s
sacrifice has been in vain, and the cur-
tain falls on the whole cast thoroughly
unhappy. Marjorie Derum, who has
been appearing in several recent reper-
tory shows with success, carried the bur-
den of the play as the mother. Margaret
Reid is the daughter, Launcelot Nicholls
the captain and Elma Nicolson a catty
countess who has rather less heart and
rather more sense than the others.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Notaden”: You needn’t go to M.L.
for inebriated livestock. When I was a
youngster the vine-
yard country round
Rutherglen (Vic.)
provided scenes of
flagrant debauchery
amongst cattle, pigs
and fowls which
would have broken
the heart of any
tem p e ranee lec-
turer. The degraded
creatures would eat
the fermented must
when it was cleared
out of the presses,
and the results
were shocking.
Cows could be seen
sitting in the road
waggling drunken
horns at passing
vehicles and moo-
ing defiantly.
Roosters would
stagger at each
other, too tight to
lift a spur, while
pro c e s sions of
glassy-eyed hens
meandered in zig-
zags like ladies
leaving a gin parlor
at closing time.
Pigs were the most
shocking—they hic-
cupped cont inu-
ously, kept on fall-
ing down and stag-
gering up. Even
the bush birds got
full. Some of us
kids tried it once
on the way to
school, but the
teacher’s reaction
kept us teetotal
thereafter.
* *
“Isharagi”: A familiar sight in the
vicinity of Sydney Harbor Bridge is a
gatherer of floating bottles who rows
about in a small boat. That’s all he does
—rows about. His dog does the rest.
Perched up in the boat, the very picture
of alertness, the mong is always first to
spot a bottle. Over he goes, grabs his
find by the neck with his teeth, and swims
to the boat. His boss tilts the gun’le
down, and in comes the bottle, followed
by the dog, who shakes himself and is
at once on the qui vive for the next.
* * * *
“Delia”: I have been living of late
at a sanatorium on the N.S.W. Blue
Mountains which is buried in a gum
forest. This is thick with birds, especially
maggies and kookas. As an amateur
naturalist I have been greatly interested
in the latter, who are finding a difficulty
in adapting themselves to a new environ-
ment —this place has not long been
opened. The electric light is turned on
at dusk just as the Jacks have made their
final whoopee and retired to bed. Those
still awake evidently mistake the illu-
mination for next morning’s sunrise, for
a surprised cackle of greeting goes up,
with the result that those asleep wake
and join in. The deluded fowls keep up
their music, growing hoarser and sleepier
until lights-out at 10 p.m. After that,
beyond an astonished squawk or two,
silence reigns until the real dayspring. I
note, though, that now the birds wait for
some time after the sky begins to lighten,
evidently desiring to make sure that
there isn’t a catch in it.
“Avis”: At Condobolin (N.S.W.) two
half-fledged kookas kept as pets in a back-
yard have been regularly fed by two
wild birds, who drop in with the tucker
half a dozen times a day. 'Most of the
scran consists of yabbies, for which the
caterers must go outside the town for at
least a mile. Their wet feathers show
that Jack is not a member of the king-
fisher family in name only.
:1c * * *
“Bufo”; Mention of the rediscovery
of Steller’s seacow (B. 19/12/’34) recalls
a curious happening of a generation ago
on the desolate south-west coast of Tas-
mania. Two fishermen, sheltering in Port
Davey, visited one of the outer beaches,
accompanied by a kangaroo dog. Well
above tidemark, they saw a strange ani-
mal, the size of a small elephant, walking
about on thick, short legs. The dog
went after it, whereupon the creature
galloped swiftly to the water, went
through the roaring surf like a fish and
swam out to sea. The yarn was laughed
at in the waterside pubs when they got
back to Hobart, but the Museum authori-

70 years. In the vast Antarctic Drift
swept by eternal gales blowing round the
world, from Cape Horn to Kerguelen
and back to Cape Horn, even stranger
seagoing animals may well exist.

“F.A.4”: If gait, figure, speech, clothes
or complexion don’t, in that order,
betray the townsman outback this
is infallible. Take a line from the
knuckle-joint of his little finger to
the base of his thumb—either hand,
or both hands if you like. If the
growth of hair is normal forward of that
line, that’s a townsman. If a bushman
has any hair on that portion of the back
of his hand you can be sure he has given
up actual work and is in some executive
position. Who told me? A good little
sort at the Anzac Buffet, Victoria-street,
London ; and she knew a lot more than
that.

“Phalanger”: One of the delights of the
outer suburbs of Sydney is the opportunity
enjoyed by residents for nature-study in
the raw. Snakes are frequent callers,
while goannas and native-cats make as
free with the poultry-yard as the bandi-
coots do with the garden. Outstanding
is the friendly and sociable ’possum, with
his fondness for galloping about above
the ceilings or sliding down the iron
roofs at night, thus safeguarding his
hosts from oversleeping themselves. But
the life’s ambition of every well-brought-
up ’possum is felo de se by electrocution.
Periodically one plunges a suburb into
darkness by short-circuiting electric-light
wires until the crackling that was a ’pos-
sum is removed. At Epping one has
celebrated Christmas in a blaze of glory.
He was a sort of pet at the local power-
house, and no doubt got the idea from
his visits there. In any case he inserted
himself into the “works,” and the sub-
sequent display of fireworks brought two
fire brigades out to squelch the flames.
There had been a heavy thunderstorm,
and this was blamed until “ ’possy” was
discovered.
* * * *
“Ikey”: “Y.O.Y.’s” Westralian gum-
tree (B. 28 /11 / ’34) to me is tree-growth
in slow-motion. Blackwattle-trees grown
from seed planted in Bringelly (N.S.W.)
school plantation on August 1, 1933, are
now 12ft. high, and can be measured by
anyone who cares to happen along.
Three-year-old trees in the same location
have their tops well above the telegraph-
poles. The record for plant-growth, in my
experience, however, is held by the red
water-shoot of a climbing rose. Three
inches from the .parent stem on Monday
morning it had attained a length of 6ft.
by Saturday of the same week. The soil
was pure clay.
* * * *
“F.A.4”: The boss of a C.Q. station
has adopted a family of butcher-birds
that have lived and nested near the
homestead for many years. They’re so
tame that when he calls they will come
inside the house —it is gauzed-in—to col-
lect their rations: small
bits of fresh meat from the
freezer, I have often seen
several of them clear
out carrying what they
evidently consider choice
cuts. As larders, they in-
variably use the mortises
in posts of the fence sur-
rounding the house ; and
1 have seen one chap in-
vestigate as many as five posts before his
luck was in. Our butcher-birds don’t
hang their kill on spikes, nor have I seen
it done anywhere on the inland water-
shed.
* * *
“Lacon”; If “Jaen Eille” (B.
12/12/’34) is a Sydneysider and really
fond of eels he need go no farther
than the Hawkesbury to gratify his pecu-
liar taste in fish. He’ll find them there
in millions, particularly in the lagoons
which skirt the river for four or five
miles between Windsor and Richmond,
I have a loathing for the slimy, needle*-
toothed horrors. During one hot summer
about 20 years ago a lagoon about 40
yards from my front door dried up.
Over 40 drayloads of rotting eels were
taken out of that one hole.
* * * *
“Sailor”: Out on the West Arm (N.T.)
there used to be an old Norwegian engi-
neer scratching for tantalite. His method
of locomotion between Adelaide and the
Territory was unique." Leaving his ship at
Port Adelaide, and being a steam engineer
at heart, he selected that means of trans-
port. He bought an out-of-date traction-
engine and an old four-wheeler lorry,
Loading the lorry up with coal and water
and his gear he started on the long jour-
ney. The trip was one of hazards, and
it is a pity that his luck was out; but
as a stranger to the fickle Territory he
knew little about the terrors of the Wet,
and into that disagreeable season he
blundered. The trip came to a muddy
end in a swollen billabong, some hun-
dred miles short of his goal.
* * * *
“Peskies”; That reference to migrating
flying-foxes (B. 26/12/’34) reminds me.
I live in a house in one of Sydney’s
eastern suburbs which has peach- and
apricot-trees in the back garden. They
have always fruited well, but this season,
for the first time in our experience, the
crops have been raided by flying-foxes.
Most of the other houses about run to
fruit-trees, and the inhabitants all tell me
that never before has the destructive
brute —he knocks down more fruit than
he eats —been known to invade that part
of the world.
* * * *
“Wagga”: How’s this for the long
arm? At a town on the Murray, N.S.W.
side, the Anglican padre went to the
cemetery to await the funeral of a
drowned man named Brown ; the R.C.
priest was also awaiting the funeral of
a drowned man named Brown. It looked
as though the undertaker, determined to
be on the right side, had arranged for
two clerics for the one burial; but it
wasn’t so. There were two undertakers,
and two drowned men to be interred,
each named Brown.

“The 0.D.”: Apropos of “C.H.M.’s”
grasshoppers that attacked green painted
posts at Cowra (B. 26/12/’34); Three
Sydney men were in Cowra that night,
and one of them went, to bed in pyjamas
patterned in broad green and puce
stripes. Yes, you’ve guessed it in one ;
they’d have eaten the puce stripes, too,
only when the ’hoppers walked on the
man’s bare skin they stamped their feet
and woke him up.
sic * * *
“Murlonga”: Though we are all
familiar with “King Combo” in picture
and story, has any person ever seen an
authorised aboriginal king? I don’t mean
the brass-plate nondescript: I mean a
king by descent or anything else that
gives him the right
to lay ‘ down the
laws to his tribe.
Personally, and
speaking with a
deal of experience
of natives, I never
knew of any king
of any tribe. I
never even heard
of one who was
recognised as even
a chief. Those in
whom the right of
rule rested were
the old men of the
tribe, though age in
reality had nothing
to do with it; any
abo. of 40 or so
could become an
“old man” when he
had acquired suf-
ficient merit by
certain feats of
magic, by the
“find-um” of a cor-
roboree or any
other old thing.
Even among these
there was never
any outstanding
figure or president;
they all spoke at
once when they did
talk. And their
laws were given by inference rather than
by direct action; they ruled—if so
it can be called —by the fear which the
young men and women had of an old
boy who was familiar with debbil-
debbils and walked v/ith ghosts. The
women, of course, didn’t count at all;
they just had to do as they were told.
♦ * * *
“Puffinus XL”: Those dead stormy
petrels weren’t peculiar to Port Hack-
ing (B. 26/12/’34 ; the whole eastern
coast was dotted with them. They had
made south to their usual feeding-grounds
in Bass Strait, but for some reason the
usual tucker hadn’t turned up. The birds
streamed along the coast in search of
their dinner, failed to find it, and a drear
decoration of dead lined the beaches.
3ft sje % *
“Barang”: One reason why the appar-
ently defenceless hare has increased (B.
14/11/’34) is nature’s unique protection
for Mrs. Hare while a nursing mother.
In this state she leaves no scent, and
she usually constructs two nests some dis-
tance apart, depositing a leveret in each.
They are born plentifully covered wit.i
hair and with their eyes open, while then
capability of running at a fair speed
shortly after birth affords them added
protection.
THE SLEEPER-CUTTER’S SHACK.
I must leave the crowded city, with its fierce
electric light
That drowns the glory of the stars and shames
the gentle night.
I must turn my old feet northward, for I’m
bent on making back
By the paths I know will lead me to a sleeper-
cutter’s shack.
There the hot sun shoots his arrows through
a brazen cloudless sky,
But the tall straight forest timbers shield the
weary passer-by.
And the way is soft and pleasant on that distant
forest track
As it skirts the first green foothills ’neath the
sleeper-cutter’s shack.
Then I’ll see the crosscut rippling as it swings
from side to side,
And I’ll hear the song it’s singing in its steady
rhythmic ride;
And I’ll see the clean cut open and I’ll feel
the saw run slack
As the forest giant crashes near the sleeper-
cutter’s shack.
I will see the timber splitting as a straight-
grained wedge-crack should,
And I’ll feel my axe-edge biting on the fresh
and fragrant wood;
Then I’ll count the new-cut sleepers I’ll be
adding to the stack
That the creaking dray will carry past the
sleeper-cutter’s shack.

“Kotuku”: Hori and his ancient
motor-truck were engaged on a contract
for the delivery of milk to the local
cheese factory. One morning as I was
overtaking him on the road, I noticed an
alarming wobble in one of- the rear
wheels of his vehicle. I “stepped on it”
to warn him of impending disaster, but
noticed, on drawing near, a notice-board
nailed to the tail-door bearing the words,
“This wheel quite safe. He won’t come
off.” “Te axle bent,” Hori told me later,
“an’ no time an’ no money to fix him.
Yesterday mornin’ one fella he pull up
an’ tell me te wheel wobble. I t’ank
him. T’en another stop me, an’ I t’ank
him too. After t’at I get a bit mad, an’
in te end I half-hour late wit’ te milk.
T’en I t’ink about te notice. Jolly good
idea, too.”

“Kell B.”; I’ll show any Aboliar who
likes to come to Haberfield (N.S.W.) a
cat that rolls his swag every night in-
stead of every morning. His favorite
blanket is a tea-towel; we compromise
by hanging a cloth behind the kitchen
door. Round about the family’s bed-
time Tom will pull this cloth down, drag
it always to the same camp-site on the
floor of the living-room and then twist
the cloth round and round till it forms
a pillow and back rest. In the morning
he just leaves it there—he probably
thinks it gave him enough trouble to
roll it up the night before without un-
rolling it.

“Lex L.”: Talking of domesticating
cassowaries (B. 21/11/ ’34), Curator Bick,
of the Brisbane Botanical Gardens, got
a pair of cassowary chicks. A few weeks
later one of the keepers reported
the loss of some valuable hen eggs.
No one suspected the cassowaries
until they were caught in the act. They

never satisfied with a true likeness.”
had been allowed the run of the fowl-
yard until old enough for exhibition ; a
cackle, they soon learned, meant an egg.

“Quark”: Those cockatoos that har-
vested the wilga (B. 26 /12/ *34) move me
to ask if any Aboliar can tell me why
the noisy beggars nip off small dead
branches when holding a U.C.P. confer-
ence in the big river gums. I have
watched them at this for hours, and the
constant rain of dry twigs carpeted the
ground for yards round every tree.
Cocky does his nesting in a hollow tree-
spout, and has no need of twigs for nest-
building. It must be just devilment, the
same spirit that makes a tame cocky
pull the studs and dees out of every
saddle he can get at in the twinkling of
an eye.
*l*
“Bramble Cay”: The frigate-bird may
be a wanderer (B. 26/12/’34), but like
all wanderers he dearly loves the domes-
ticated life on occasion. Many of the
Pacific peoples keep these birds as pets
in their villages, going to the length of
building roosts for them. Round about
Milne Bay, in Papua, it used to be quite
common to see several of these sea-
rovers loafing on their perches during the
heat of the day waiting for the other
varieties of gulls to return from sea with
the evening meal. When the time for
this came the lean-against-a-post attitude
disappeared, and the loafers took the air
like fighting ’planes. When the incoming
gulls had been sufficiently robbed, some
of the spoilers came back to the perches
and others went a-wandering. The
natives got nothing ouTof these birds in
the way of fish, but they undoubtedly
had a totem significance.
* * * *
“J.G.”: Year after year I plant the
same kind of flowers in a particular bed
each summer. As the time comes round
for planting out the seedlings a few self-
sown plants pop up from seeds fallen
the previous year. These natives are
always left well alone by snails and slugs.
What’s the explanation?
* * * *
“Gumblegubbin”: During his Queens-
land tour the Duke of Gloucester was
presented with a bridle made of plaited
kangaroo leather. This leather is useful
for many purposes, including black-
smiths’ aprons, for which basil is com-
monly used. Recently a Scottish firm
bought 150 kangaroo-skins for the pur-
pose of making portions of their bag-
pipes out of them. The idea came from
a member of a pipe band at Lawrence
(M.L.) who has a set made of ’roo
leather. Among the qualifications is that
the ’roo doesn’t sweat through the skin,
and so there are no pores to cause a
leakage of air from Scotty’s windbags.
“Mug Gunner”: Do certain species of
migratory birds ever lose the art of navi-
gation or do they just sicken of places?
Take the avoset. Not since pre-war years
have they appeared in the swamplands
of western Victoria. Crested and plover-
like, and garbed in black-and-white, the
avoset is a wader whose main peculiarity
is an outsize recurving bill. On the
marshlands about Southampton (Eng.)
during the war I saw these fowls
in countless thousands; their aerial
manoeuvrings were a delight to behold in
an otherwise bleak and waterlogged
landscape.
* * * ♦
“Parmelia”: A hard-up Victorian
wheat-farmer stored his car. When the
next cheque came along he decided
to restore it to the roads. In the
process of cleaning it he discovered
that a rat had made a nest under
the seat, and portion of the lining
was a£l note. As the cocky had
not seen anything of the kind on the
premises for a long time, he con-
cluded the rat had obtained it else-
where and left it as payment for
board and lodging.
Jacky ( movie-struck ): “Good-bye, Mary. If I don't come back I’ll be seein’ yuh.”
“Bogaduck”: No matter how carefully
you design a chimney in open country,
an east wind will make it smoke. In
my South Australian district there is
a tall stack topped by a revolving cowl
with a vane to keep it always pointed
away from the wind. But an easterly
beats it. You’ll see the smoke streaming
from it one minute ; the next instant the
smoke appears to get into reverse and fly
down the chimney again. Then the cook
comes out of the kitchen door in the
middle of a cloud of smoke, her eyes
streaming and her tongue laden with
bitter complaints. Yet the cowl hasn’t
moved, proving that it isn’t a shift of
wind which does the damage.
* * . * *
“M.R.P.”: “Lux” (B. 21/11/’34), men-
tioning Islanders drawing nourishment
from nature’s fount up to adolescence,
reminds me of a very weak-looking gin
at Laverton (W.A.) who came for her
daily ration suckling a piccaninny, of
seven or eight. Whether this was the rule
or the, exception I can’t say.
* * * *
- “Koax, Koax”: The world is full of
queer trades, and one of them came to
light when the matter of a witness’s ex-
penses was being argued in a London
court. He said he earned 255. a day the
year round collecting frogs for the snakes
in Regent’s Park Zoo. Other experts sup-
plied snails and water-plants for zoo
fish; he confined himself strictly to
frogs, of which he was official purveyor.
The only catch in the job, apart from the
frogs, is that many of the snakes go to
sleep in winter. Anyway, finding frogs in
an English winter would be a task beside
which Diogenes’ search for an honest
alderman was a sinecure.
* * * *
“The 0.D.”: Anyone seen him lately?
Some joker at Menindie appointed him
official ant exterminator for the Darling
River, and he used to carry a swag and
a kerosene-tin up and down between
Menindie and Wentworth. The bucket
had a lid, and he used to fill it up with
the little stinking black-ants of the plains
and then boil ’em. His tally must be
pretty high now.

“Paki”: Even little Kawhia, on the
West Coast of Maoriland, is celebrating
a centenary, it being just 100 years since
the first Methodist mission was founded
by the Rev. John Whitely on the pretty
shores of the harbor. A memorial
church is being erected, most of the
labor being given gratis by Henare. The
foundation stone was laid with due cere-
monial by the Maori “King,” and was
attended by pakeha and Maori visitors
from all over the North Island.
* * * *
“Bondite”: There need be no heart-
burning and recrimination between the
people who assert that sharks will not
attack colored human beings and vice
versa. Both sides are right. Sharks are
attracted by anything gleaming in the
water —every fisherman knows the use of
the spoon-flash bait —and white people
gleam considerably more than their black
brudders. Where sharks are greatly
feared, it is common for timorous
bathers to wear costumes which cover
their bodies completely, leaving the arms,
legs, etc., of the more intrepid to act as
bait for the raveners. This indicates
that councils need not worry about the
rise of nudism. The sharks will settle
that question by liquidating the nudists
and eventually leaving fully-garbed
bathers—a standing example of the sur-
vival of the fittest, according to bumble
definition.

“E.S.”: Another attempt is being
made to find the last camp of Ludwig
Leichhardt. For years blacks in Cen-
tral ia have persistently reported that an
iron box, which they can’t open, together
with rusted bullock bows and iron tyres
of a dray, are lying far out in the desert,
intermittently buried and exposed by the
winds. The relics are alleged to have
belonged to Leichhardt. Some time back
an expedition set out from Westralia
to investigate, but failed to reach within
100 miles of the place. No explorer ever
caught the popular fancy so much as
Leichhardt, and the search for “L trees”
has continued ever since he disappeared.
The remotest one discovered is on the
Flinders, where Duncan Mclntyre left
his bones.

“Ronel”: “Cejay” (B. 21/11/ ’34), in
the excitement of paying out that dozen
of beer over the bet he lost crossing the
Daly (N.T.), seems to have got a trifle
mixed. You’ll never get through if you
keep the stern of the craft towards the
side of the stream you are making for ;
whether log-raft or streamlined canoe,
keep that stern to the bank you
leave behind. A 45deg. angle to the
directioii of current is too much when
it is rapid—about 15deg. is better. And
you must allow for drift, and plenty of it.

“Spare Walton”: No doubt the water-
rat is a good swimmer and fisherman (B.
26/12/’34). I am prepared to swear on
a stack of “Hansards” that he is the most
accomplished pincher of other people’s
catches I have ever encountered. My first
experience of this was when night-fishing
on the Balonne at Gulnarbor station (Q.).
I caught half a dozen tuck-eye and small
cod, and about 10 o’clock rose to go up
the bank, only to find the fish I had
placed on one side behind me had
vanished. A brother given to practical
joking was fishing not far off. To my
accusations he smilingly remarked
“water-rats,” and pointed to where his
fish were hung on a sapling well off the
ground. After that I always hung my
catch up.
“TWENTY AFTER THREE.”
They’re calling in the morning
While the rooster’s in the tree,
Before the stars have left the sky
Or anyone can see:
“Get up! Get up, you sleepy head!
It’s twenty after three,
And time to get the milking done,”
They’re calling out to me.
It makes one wish there wasn’t such
A creature as a cow,
Or milking pails or blanky bails
Or folks who make a row.
Before the roosters leave the trees
Or anyone can see,
With “Time to get the milking done,
It’s twenty after three!”

125 FOR SUCCESS STORIES.
Mostly Australia hears of her farming failures, but there are many men
on the land who have a romantic record of success—men who started out,
with little capital, on rough scrub land, and made good despite low prices,
bad communications and high taxes; men who bought properties on which
others had failed and made them pay; men who began with nothing but
stock knowledge as capital and turned it to good account; men to whom
pasture improvement has brought a competence.
‘The Bulletin” is offering prizes for stories of success in any branch
of farming, written by the parties themselves or by others to whom the facts
have been communicated. If the latter, proofs of genuineness must be
furnished.
First prize £2O
Second prize £3
Third prize £2
And ten “Bulletin” drawings by well-known artists. Space rates will
be paid for all non-prizewinning efforts published.
A story must not exceed eight hundred words in length. It must be
sent in an envelope addressed to the Editor and marked “Success Competition”
not later than January 31 next. The Editor’s decisions and awards will
be final.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
THE STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITTS LINSEED MEAL
HOT-WEATHER LAMB-MARKING.
“Lion”: Muster at “false” dawn, and
start as soon as the lambs have cooled
off, or muster the previous night and
start at “false” dawn. The former knocks
the lambs about less. Don’t let the lambs
get too big before marking.
Put them in a small catching yard,
which saves knocking about and dust.
The instruments should be kept sterilised
by dipping them repeatedly into a tin of
strong antiseptic—bichloride of mercury
will do, but it is deadly poison.
When tailing, slide the skin towards
the butt with the back of the knife, and
then sever. This allows the “slid-back”
portion of the skin to come forward, and
re-cover the butt. Apply antiseptic fly re-
pellent thoroughly.
Drive as little as possible after mark-
ing.
Preferably animals should be marked
in their own paddocks in temporary
yards.
Should a strike occur, drive the vic-
tims to a yard in preference to holding
them in the paddock with dogs.
Some prefer to use the searing iron to
prevent bleeding. These irons can be
made by drawing out a portion of the
edge of an old horse rasp to a cutting
edge, leaving the weight at the back to
retain the heat. When red-hot this cuts
as quickly as a knife, and is antiseptic
all the time. With several irons in use
there will be no loss of time.
PHOSPHORUS NEEDS OF SHEEP.
“Jass”: The use of licks containing a
liberal percentage of Nauru phosphates,
sterilised bonemeal, dicalcic phosphate,
etc., together with salt, magnesium, iron
and other minerals, is widespread
amongst Australian woolgrowers, and the
view is almost general that these licks,
by making good the de:ficiency of the
natural pasture, keep the sheep in better
health and help wool production.
Farms also are top-dressed with super,
to correct phosphorus deficiency.
The report of experiments begun by
the C.S.I.R. in June, 1929, at Dismal
Swamp, near Mount Gambier (SA.), will
astonish many woolgrowers. The coun-
try is notoriously phosphorus-deficient,
and it was to be expected that the use of
phosphatic licks would show substantial
economic gains. Six licks supplying
phosphorus were fed to six batches of
lambs. A seventh group was given salt
(94.6 per cent.) and molasses (5.6 per
cent.) only, whilst a further group was
placed in a paddock top-dressed with
2cwt. super, per acre, and given the salt-
molasses iick. Every precaution was
taken to ensure that the lick was the sole
varying factor.
None of the groups receiving phospha-
tic licks showed any appreciable increase
in either body-weight or wool-growth
over the group receiving salt and molasses
only. The lambs on the top-dressed pas-
ture, however, despite heavier stocking,
made better growth and) yielded 15 to
20 per cent, more wool than any of the
other groups. . '
It looks as if protein is a bigger factor
in sheep health and, wool-growth than
phosphorus. The immediate effect of
supplying phosphorus to the soil in the
form of phosphates is to stimulate the
growth of the pasture, especially of
clovers and herbage rich in protein. Cer-
tainly from this increased protein sup-
ply the sheep derive benefit. But would
phosphatic lick, most of which passes
through the sheep unchanged, benefit
pasture, as compared with no lick or a
non-phosphatic one?
FLY TROUBLES SUMMED UP.
“Crutchem”: The pros and cons of
dipping, traps, controls, jetting, scientific
facts, etc., have all had their turn, yet no
one has conclusively proved or disproved
anything to date.
Old methods seem to be best:
(1) Keep the sheep healthy and free
from vermin—this allows the dipping
enthusiast to have his say as well as the
drencher. Both have their place in fly
control.
(2) See that the sheep are kept free
from, dags ' and other fly attractions.
Crutch, jet and cull wrinkly-breeched and
continually fly-struck sheep.
(3) Breed away from wrinkly-breeches
with the right type of rams. The small
amount of wool lost is handsomely re-
turned in other ways.
(4) Take care dogs don’t nip sheep
and that they are not knocked about in
yarding or in the races. Wounds lead
to fly-strike. Special care is necessary at
dipping time.
When taken constantly in time there
is no need to segregate struck sheep or
use a hospital paddock.
Use a reliable dressing, preferably one
mixing with water, and see it gets to the
skin. I know a good, cheap dressing, the
name of which I will be glad to give to
any- reader.
Boiled down, the golden cure for all
fly troubles is hard graft and a good
dressing. *r
“W.D.McC.”: When “Albarmount” (B.
19/12/’34) states that his sheep were
blown “a fortnight after dipping,” I
suggested that something was amiss with
his methods.
, There is no doubt that in old type
“jump-in-and-scramble” dips the sheep
did get rough handling. With a properly-
constructed “Walk-in” plant and a team
of men who know their job animals
can be dipped without any harm or loss
whatever even if heavy in lamb.
“Albarmount” says that dip action
seems to “clam” the dirt into the wool.
This condition shows that the liquid in
the bath has been allowed to get filthy.
He evidently has not got a proper catch
pit or pits, and the manure and .dirt are
allowed to run back into the bath with-
out straining or settling, or perhaps the
bath is not cleaned out as frequently as
it should be.
You cannot dip sheep in a mixture of
manure and mud and expect to get clean
wool and at the same time protection
from fly.
WATER-ROT AND FLY-ATTACK.
“Albarmount”: “G.H.H.” gives the
scientist’s viewpoint (B. 19/12/’34), and
states that some water-rot organisms—
or a complex of them —break down tis-
sues so that an exudation through the
skin provides food for the maggots.
This theory is hardly consistent with
that put forward by the C.S.I.R. a couple
of years ago—that the predisposing fac-
tor was wrinkles. My experience is that
the “wrinkles,” while naturally more sus-
ceptible to strike, are not given to water-
rot to the same extent as the long-stapled,
dense-woolled, plain-bodied sheep. Their
excess of yolk, no doubt, is the respon-
sible factor. Also, it is very rarely I have
had a rot-woolled sheep fly-blown.
Again, if humidity is the first essential
to the growth of water-rot bacteria, as
“G.H.H.” asserts, why is the incidence
of strike so much greater in hot, dry
places like Coonamble (N.S.W.) than on
the more humid tablelands?
I do not wish to disparage “G.H.H.’s”
ideas —he has given us a new angle to
observe —but theories depending on
humidity or wrinkles —don’t carry con-
viction whilst plain-bodied sheep run-
ning on the c.w. plains of N.S.W. are so
subject to fly-attack.
’HOPPERS AND FLY.
“Dry Blow”: A future menace which
is being overlooked in this wholesale de-
struction of ’hoppers is the blowfly plague
which will surely follow.
Years ago I destroyed a host of baby
’hoppers. A couple of days later I had
a look at the results of my good deed.
1 would have backed the deceased for
scent against any dead bullock. And on
top of them and in among them all the
blowflies of the world were busy on the
job.
SHEARING RECORDS.
“Murrawong”; Many attempts have
been made to better Jack Howe’s record
oi 321 sheep with the blades in less than
eight hours, but he remains the “gun of
guns.” Most rival claims have lapsed
for lack of proper authentication.
A new record, however, is now put
forward by Sonny White (M.L.) of 433
sheep in nine hours. It works out
roughly at three sheep per hour better
than Howe’s, and has merit as a more
sustained effort, although there is bound
to be a controversy, because the Queens-
lander made his tally in merinos and the
M.L. man on Romney ewes.
Straining after records is not in the
best interests of the wool industry, but
a competitive spirit will always prevail,
and it is time that some reliable body
took charge of things. Agricultural
societies are probably best suited for the
job.
There must be recognised standards in
the matter of hours, class of sheep, etc.
Most recent tallies have been made in
crossbred lambs, and it is hardly reason-
able to compare these small, straight-
necked beasts with no trimmings with
merinos.
I suggest three classes: (1) Merino,
showing permanent teeth ; (2) crossbreds
or comebacks, ditto; (3) lambs. Tallies
should be made on sheep caught within
the eight hours of the normal working
day, and should be under average work-
ing conditions. Above all, every claim
should be accompanied by a certificate
from the owner and board boss that the
sheep were well shorn.
The R.A.S, holds regular wood-chop-
ping and cattle-drafting competitions, and
it seems certain that shearing competi-
tions would draw big crowds. The diffi-
culty would be to ensure large, even
flocks of sheep and to time the event so
that competitors would have their hands
in. That would be toward the end of the
year for the southern States.
WATCH THE WEANERS.
“Valerin”: Grass-seed, thistles and
other prickly growths cause trouble in
young sheep. The sharp points pierce
the lips, which fester and become so
painful that the animal refuses to eat.
This is especially true of weaners, whose
incisor teeth are loose, and the tendency
is to use the lips in picking off feed.
As soon as the sheep begin to lose
condition, draft off the affected ones and
immerse their noses for a few seconds in
a solution of permangate of.potash, about
as strong as ah ordinary gargle. Licking
round the muzzle carries the solution into
the mouth. Except in bad cases one
dressing will prove effective.
Also, handle for eye trouble, mainly
due to seed, which can be removed with
small forceps. If the eyes are “clouded,”
wash out with weak boracic acid.
PROTEIN CONVERSION.
“Stump Jump” : “Molecule” is hardly
correct (B. 19/12/’34) in saying that any
protein in excess of the quantity needed
by an animal can be converted to energy-
giving food (carbohydrates).
Actual tests show that only a small
proportion can be converted.
Lambs fed on lucerne solely digested
only 52 p.c. of the crude protein, but
when the lucerne was given as 10 p.c.
of a maize-chaff-lucerne mixture the
lambs got 89 p.c. out of it. Absence
of carbohydrate balance in the pure
ration was the cause of the lucerne’s bad
food value. The woollies did poorly on
it, too. Its protein-carbo. ratio was 1
to 2.
Maize is a good balancer. Increasing
the proportion of it in the foregoing test
it raised the lucerne protein’s digestibility
from 89 p.c. to 96 p.c. Providing the
purest and best of all starches, its use
could well be extended.
The proportion of crude fibre in a
ration has a mechanical action on the

RHEUMATISM
Watch those First Sharp Twinges of Pain, and TAKE ACTION NOW!
Almost before you are aware of your peril, you may find that Rheumatism has
you in its merciless grip, and the result is not pleasant. Don’t let Rheumatism
conquer you. Don’t hesitate and waste precious time while the ailment get a
firmer hold upon you, but go to your chemist now and get a box of De Witt’s
Pills—the remedy that has been successfully used in all parts of the world.
You cannot choose a better remedy. Read this remarkable letter sent us by
a grateful user. Then ask your chemist. He will tell you that De Witt’s Pills
contain ingredients which will prove beneficial in cases of rheumatic trouble.
You may think your case is too far advanced for De Witt’s Pills to
help you. Don’t make this big mistake. If rheumatoid arthritis has already
distorted your limbs you cannot expect a cure, but De Witt’s Pills will
ease your pain and possibly check the progress of the disease. Going
to the other extreme, you may think you can do without De Witt’s
Pills because you only experience rheumatism in a mild form
occasionally.

Those early symptoms need attention, and you will be acting
wisely if you get a box of De Witt’s Pills from the chemist at the
' first opportunity. The cost is trifling, and surely it
is worth while taking one or two pills when you
know that by doing so you will enjoy better health
now and ensure freedom from pain in years to come.
Watch for such symptoms as puffiness under
the eyes, heaviness of the limbs, swollen feet
or ankles, foul breath, scalding pains, gravel
or stone. These symptoms usually precede attacks
of Rheumatism, Backache, Lumbago, Sciatica or
serious Kidney Trouble, and much suffering and
expense may be saved by quickly getting a box of
De Witt’s Pills from the chemist and taking them
as directed. Sold only in the blue, white and gold
boxes, price 3/6, or larger, more economical size, 6/6.
Mr. M. Preston, of 193, Elizabeth Street, Redfern,
Sydney, N. S.W., says: “I cannot speak too highly of
De Witt’s Pills. I can honestly say they gave me instant
relief. Having suffered for many years from kidney trouble
and rheumatism, I tried a large number of remedies without
result, until I gave De Witt’s Pills a trial One bottle was
sufficient to show results, but I continued using them until my
trouble had completely gone.’’

membranes of the digestive canal, in-
ducing adequate secretion of digestive
juices.
It must be bulky enough to fill the big
spaces inside the animal to ensure full
muscular movement of the bowels. When
feeding, the droppings should be studied.
Tightness shows insufficient bulk, or else
too much indigestible fibre. Fibre should
be 60 p.c. digestible. Scouring and pour-
ing are caused by bad digestion, often
due to there being not enough fibre to
food and water. Perfectly balanced
feeds always keep the droppings correctly
slack.
CURING FISTULA.
“The Breaker": “Sorghum’s” advice
for the treatment of fistulous withers (B.
12/12/ ’34) is far*from thorough. As with
poll-evil, Nature’s healing must be as-
sisted. Dead tissues must be thoroughly
destroyed to give the wound a chance to
heal by granulation. Where “Sorghum’s”
treatment and advice fail is in not men-
tioning a little bubbly red spot apt to
be left behind after an apparent cure.
This is the root of another fistula.
My method is as follows: Foment the
swelling to entice a head, and when ripe
lance towards the bottom with a well-
sterilised instrument. Open the wound
well so as to ensure draining. Wash
liberally with a 12 per cent, solution of
zinc-chloride.
With a seton needle, a tape with
arsenic paste should be passed through
from the highest to the lowest point, and
the wound washed regularly. The zinc-
chloride should not be used after the pipe
has been destroyed, otherwise granula-
tion is retarded. When suppuration
ceases the seton can be withdrawn and
a milder dressing used, but if that little
red spot appears fresh treatment is needed
straight away.
All horses with fistulous withers must
be isolated.
SILAGE TECHNIQUE.
“Verandah Manager”:
“Aerogenes” (B. 28/12/’34) states: “My
lucerne chaff costs about £1 per ton and my
ensilage 10s. per ton to produce on the farm.”
Feeding lucerne, his 100 cows bring him 13s.
per day over feed costs. Feeding lucerne and
ensilage, his 100 cows give him a £2 6s. margin
over feed costs. I want to know his costs of
handling and milking a herd of 100 cows per
day. Can it be done for 13s. or even for
465. per day?
“Aerogenes”: I have a four-unit milk-
ing machine, and two good hands and
myself handle the 100 cows. With £2 a
week each for the men and the same for
my own efforts, labor costs me, per
week, £6.
Other costs are:
Running expenses of milking plant,
including repairs and deprecia-
tion, per week £1 10 0
Maintenance and depreciation of
other plant and buildings .... 210 0
Interest at 4 p.c. on a 300-acre farm
valued at £5OOO 4 0 0
Total running costs £l4 0 0
Margin over feed costs —at £2 6s.
per day—per week 16 2 0
Profit to me , £2 2 0
These figures are on the generous side.
My cattle are purebreds, and I get some-
thing from the sale of stud stock, which
I don’t take into account here.
You can see that I lose heavily if I
feed lucerne only, but gain a little if I
feed ensilage.
THE ’HOPPER PROBLEM.
The Noxious Insects Act of
1934 declares the ’hopper a noxious in-
sect throughout N.S.W.
Landholders will be compelled to
destroy, and more power has been granted
to the P. P. Boards, more red tape in-
stituted in the way of returns to fill up.
Doubtless a whole army of fresh jobs
will be found at our expense.
The regulations provide that all
’hoppers shall be destroyed by (a) poison-
ing with poison baits, or ( b ) by poison
sprays. The farmer is compelled to fill
in returns stating if a swarm or any
’hoppers are laying eggs on his land.
Both sprays and baits are to contain
arsenic in suitable proportions to kill,
and will, therefore, kill other insects and
birds, as well as ’hoppers. No one appar-
ently has learnt the lesson taught us by
the loss of our valuable bird life just
after rabbit-poisoning began to “work
wonders.” We are told, certainly, that
the poison will not be strong enough to
kill birds. This is tripe. Try feeding
the canary or the pet lamb on ’hopper
bait and see how long he will last.
Birds are our natural protectors from
many plagues. To destroy them is sui-
cidal, and thus the cure will be worse
than the disease. I would sooner have
the ’hoppers than the place smothered
with arsenic.
SOWING RHODES GRASS.
“C.Q. Coast”; Sow Rhodes-grass seed
in the Q. coastal scrubs as soon as the
timber is burned or you may have a pad-
dock of weeds instead of pasture. Rhodes
is tricky to establish, though it will hold
its own once it is rooted. Make sure
the seed is fertile. Sprinkle some on a
soil bed and cover with a wet sack, water-
ing daily. Four to five days should cause
germination.
A fairly reliable test is to rub a small
quantity between the palms of the hands
vigorously. If the seed is good tiny
brown kernels like fragments of cigar-
ette tobacco will separate from the husk.
Don’t sow more than 21b. per acre,
but broadcast thoroughly. Half a pound
per acre well spread will give a better
stand of grass than 31b. thrown in
patches.
If sown thickly the seedlings grow up-
wards, and are weak and spindly. If
scattered thinly the plants run on the
surface and root. I sow lib. per acre if
no other crop is planted and |lb. with
maize, cotton or pumpkins. Showery
weather is the best for germination, as a
hot day will burn off the seedlings. Once
the plants have two leaves they are safe.
It is often easier to germinate the grass
in a growing crop of maize than on a
bare surface, as the maize keeps the sur-
face shaded and damp.
REFILLING BURROWS.
“Try It”: Tell “Whalebone” (B.
12/12/’34) that the best policy is to fill
the burrow completely two days after
digging out. This allows time to see if
any occupied shoots have been missed,
also if any “outside” doe is working it.
Our P.P. Board (Riverina) consistently
advocates the refilling policy. It saves
stock losses, prevents paddock damage,
and if sown down to Wimmera rye and
sub. clover afterwards is a splendid im-
provement. All burrows treated should
be watched until the paddock is clean.
I am satisfied that rabbits will work
any burrow, no matter what its con-
dition.
“Albarmount”; To “Whalebone”: A
better plan is to fill in the trench as the
burrows are being dug out, leaving only
the ends open. This prevents erosion
and accidents. Also, if the rabbits re-
burrow they are easily dug out of the
loose soil.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Valerin”: In a rabbit pack working
on my property are two small cats which
carry out ferret work in the large bur-
rows. The hounds treat them with
marked respect.
“J.T.”: Old plough discs may be
heated and moulded into spring teeth for
the spring-tooth cultivator.
“M.M.”: When travelling a mower by
metal road, old tyre-covers to fit the
wheels insure a more comfortable ride
with less injury to the machine. Any
garage has a stock of old tyres to be
bought for a song. It doesn’t matter if
they fit sloppily so long as they stay on.
“A.G.T.”; To tighten wooden truck
wheels quickly, cut wedges from bale
hoop-iron. Make one end of each
diagonally. Slack the hub bolts and
drive the wedges between the spokes so
that the diagonal point on striking the
hub will bend and stop the wedges from
working out. Retighten the hub bolts.
“Large White”: Pigs fed charcoal in
addition to a balanced ration of meat
and cereal meals made greater weight
gains in recent German tests than con-
trols similarly fed except for charcoal.
Charcoal has great powers of absorp-
tion of gases and acids. Hence it is
especially valuable where pigs are grazed.
“Gumblegubbin”: When grinding
tools, turn the stone towards the blade.
If turned the other way, the edge of the
tool is apt to burr or turn up.

With never a single break;
Still higher and higher it madly rose

So he sprang to his feet with a resolute

And he had to make the tea!

A BIT MIXED.
It was Monday fortnight, as the crow
flies, on a blistering hot day in the great
Australian desert. The postman had for-
gotten to call, so the two men on the
raft had no chance of getting a drink,
even if there had been a hotel within
200 miles. They were gradually starving
to death. One of them was me, and so
was the other. In fact, I was both of
them.
Eternities seemed to pass; in fact,
so long that the N.S.W. opening bats-
men had 27 runs on the board, hav-
ing by this time lost only one wicket,
which had been kicked during the first
chukka.
Matters went from bad to worse, and
back again, in a way that increased the
intense monotony. How long was this
going to go on? It was a harrowing
thought; and to get away from it I tried
to think of all the nice, long, foaming
pints of cool beer I could remember —
millions of them, ringing out peal on
peal afar.
They only intensified the agony in my
throat, and recalled the wreck, although
all I could remember of it was a crash
and a sound Jike glasses being broken.
And so it still went on until
“Wake up, old chap! New Year’s
Day! How about a bottle of cool lager?
You ought to want it after last night.”
Last night? What a night it must
have been.

PLAYING MECHANICALLY.
, “One stroke that Brugnon used with great
judgment was his lift drive.” — “S. M. Herald.”
The great advantage of this drive,
which is really a drop-shot, is that it
comes down quickly, thus forcing the
opponent to take it on the rise. Many
a champion has been “floored” with a
(•ft drive. The experienced exponent
does it automatically.
Then there is the electric-iron drive.
This is the one that scorches the side
lines ; it is a real sizzler.
The player who wishes to slow the
game up, particularly if it is late in the
afternoon, exploits the tram drive ; this
will enable him, if he is not too slow on
his feet, to get to the the net before the
ball passes it.
The motor drive, however, is probably
the game’s most prolific shot —just a
matter of hit and run. If done properly
there is no effective answer to it; even
after a string of curses the advantage is
still with the driver. This drive, if
executed by a woman, usually paves the
way for a good smash. I’d like to tell
you more about it, but I’ll leave that to
the wife ; she’ll explain everything from
the back seat.

HEADS ARE RIGHT.
A scientist has stated that the brain of
man will in the remote future be twice
GAOL LIBRARIAN: “Sorry, but you’re eighty-seventh on the list for Houdini’s
‘Book of Escapes.’”
the size and weight that it is now, and
that, if eugenically controlled, it may be
standardised.
It will certainly require great patience
on the part of the eugenist and a long
period of evolution to bring the brains of
the politician and the economic expert
up to the requisite standard, while alder-
men and punters will become extinct. If
the standard is raised sufficiently high, the
world might even produce geniuses who
can explain the A + B theorem, and why
gas bills are the same size when
you’ve been away for a fortnight’s holi-
day ; and perhaps someone who could
actually check up his income-tax assess-
ment with the formula given on the back
of it.
When the brain of man does eventu-
ally get weightier, a redistribution of the
bodily weight will he essential to balance
it. The feet will doubtless become larger
as a compensation, though unless one is
filled with a blind admiration for police-
men that can scarcely be termed com-
pensation.
Bigger heads will naturally be neces-
sary to carry the bigger brain. This
will have a beneficial effect on the hair-
cutting and felt-hat industries, causing the
flapper press of the period to shriek in
screamer headlines that the depression is
over, and that we are “on the high road
to returning prosperity.”

THEIR RIGHT.
There was a row in the radio studio.
A pack of women announcers stormed
at the programme manager’s door.
“What on earth’s wrong with them?”
asked the programme manager. “I don't
see why they’re after my blood.”
“Well, you did make rather a slip,”
his assistant explained. “Look at this
programme. Men announcers at the end
of the sessions! Don’t you know the
women must have the last word?”
M. D. S.
Selling is, of course, the only real pro-
fession. However much the doctor or
lawyer may pride himself on the dignity
of his position, he is after all merely sell-
ing his services for what he can get.
The salesman proper sells not services
but things—aeroplanes, safety-pins, min-
ing rights and sausage-machines.
Many people study salesmanship, but
the real man who comes
to your door, fixes you with his eye and
convinces you that what you need more
than anything else in the world is his
combination nutcracker, hair-restorer and
turf guide—is a special creation of
Providence and needs no training. He
is gifted with an air of assurance, a con-
vincing manner and a boundless supply
of simple faith. He believes whole-
heartedly in the merits of whatever article
he happens to be selling at the moment.
He will call at your office.
“No,” you will say firmly, after 40
minutes of sales talk. “I don’t want a
mousetrap, but you have quite convinced
me that the ‘Catchem’ is the best, and
if I ever need one I’ll ring you.” He
leaves his card and departs. A week
later he is back again. Without giving
him a chance to speak, you assure him
that you still don’t want a trap, but that
if and when the need arises the
“Catchem” shall have your support.
“ ‘Catchem’?” he replies. “That’s just what
I’ve come about. I’m not with that firm
now. I’m selling ‘Springquick.’ Abso-
lutely the best trap on the market. The
‘Catchem’ is all right in its way, but it
can’t compare with the ‘Springquick.’
I’ve come to leave another card.”
The super-salesman is the one who
can beard the manager in his den and
sell him one of his own products and
convince him that he has secured a bar-
gain. To such a man nothing is impos-
sible. He is even capable of selling a
politician a rail ticket.
But all cannot reach this class, and
the ordinary salesman should not be dis-
couraged by a few rebuffs. If in the
course of an interview he is kicked down
the stairs and his washing-machine is
hurled after him, he should rise to his
feet, dust his clothes and consider the
situation. The prospect is still a possible
buyer, but certainly not of washing-
machines. Well, then, why not try him
with a radio?
If this fails the salesman should get
his trousers repaired (dogs are so care-
less) and return to the fray with a type-
writer or a set of banned books. Ulti-
mately he may effect a sale.
The point to remember is that a man
is always a possible buyer until he is
dead, and even then his relatives are
probably good for a tombstone or con-
dolence cards.
The true salesman never gives up.

THE MAN WHO WAITED.
Simon O’Doone lowered his pint and
stared incredulously across the bar. Yes!
His eyes had not deceived him ! He was
gazing at Michael Blupp, the rake who
had eloped with his wife 20 years ago!
Twenty long years—but Simon had not
forgotten. He had waited for this
moment. He had thought of it while
eating, drinking, sitting, walking and
working ; he had even dreamed of it.
Always it had been present in his mind.
And now the time had come.
He strode resolutely around the bar
and confronted Michael Blupp.
“You’re the man who eloped with my
wife!” he accused.
Blupp shivered. “Ye-es,” he assented.
Simon extended his hand. “Thanks! ”
he said.

XVI. — THE SALESMAN.
When the salesman comes a-selling
Goods that no one wants to buy,
Neither business place nor dwelling
Can escape his searching eye.
Shares in goldmines, carpet beaters,
Fancy socks and diamond rings,
Motor-cars, electric heaters,
Mousetraps, clocks and furnishings —
Loud his products’ praise he sings.
Yet you know, and know full well,
Whatsoever goods he brings
You’re the one he wants to sell.

Was Sid Sullivan ever featherweight champion
of Australia ? If so, from whom did he win the
championship, and was he in possession of the
title for long ? —4887.
Although Frank Thorn outpointed Sullivan
in 20 rounds at Melbourne on April 12, 1909,
Sullivan then became recognised as feather-
weight champion of Australia because Thorn
was overweight. Sullivan then successfully de-
fended the 9st. title against all-comers until
Billy Elliott beat him in 20 rounds at the
Sydney Stadium on April 27, 1910.

Where does a man apply to get a job at one
of these out-of-the-way aerodromes, like that
at Akyab ? Who is responsible for the organi-
sation of such aerodromes ? —4802.
The organisation and control of aerodromes
is, in the main, the responsibility of the Gov-
ernment of the country in which the aerodrome
is situated. Akyab and similar aerodromes
in Burma are controlled by the Indian Gov-
ernment, whilst other aerodromes en route
from Calcutta to Darwin are under the control
of the respective Governments of Siam, Malaya
and Netherlands India, according to situation.
(1) What are some of the widest streets in
Australia ? (2) Population of Adelaide ?— 4954.
(1) Sturt-street, Ballarat, is the widest
thoroughfare in any city of Australia. King
William-street, the main thoroughfare, and
Grote, Hutt, Jeffcott and Wakefield streets,
in the city of Adelaide, are each 132 ft. wide
between building alignments. They are among
the widest streets in Australia. (2) At the
1933 census the population of .the City of
Adelaide proper was 31,390, and of the metro-
politan area 314,829.

What constitutes (1) a town and (2) a city
in New South Wales ? (3) Names of cities in
N.S.W. ? (4) What publications give similar
information regarding other States ? —4644.
(1) A town, in general, is any large collec-
tion of houses and buildings constituting a dis-
tinct place with a name and not incorporated as
a city. (2) A municipality may be proclaimed
under the Local Government Act as a city
if it is an independent centre of population with
an average population of 20,000 people and an
average annual income of at least £20,000. (3)
Sydney, Armidale, Bathurst, Goulburn, Grafton
and Newcastle were proclaimed as cities under
the Crown Lands Act of 1885, and Broken
Hill was proclaimed under the Local Govern-
ment Act in 1907. (4) The official year-books
of the various States.
What was the Roman notation above M for
1000 ? For instance, how were 2000, 5000 and
1,000,000 expressed? —47o2.
In its original form the thousand sign M
was a half-circle like a D laid on its flat, with
a vertical bar dividing it. For 10,000 another
half-circle was added to this sign, concentrically
above the first; for 100,000 yet another, and
so on. The original sign for 500 was not
D but half a D, forming a quarter-circle
joined to a vertical. For 5000 another quarter-
circle was added, concentric to the first; for
50,000 the sign contained three quarter-circles,
and so on. For groups smaller than 5 or 10
the additive principle was adopted, as in MM
for 2000, MMD for 2500.

applying to adopt must be of good repute and
a fit and proper person to have the care and
custody of the child, and able to bring up,
maintain and educate the child. (4) Yes,
but there are legal intricacies to be coped with.
(5) Any history of the child that may be known
to the Child Welfare Department is made
available to the adopting parents.
Of the men who held portfolios in the
McGowen Ministry in N.S.W., who are dead
and who are alive ? What occupations do those
alive now follow ? —4650.
J. S. T. McGowen, W. A. Holman, J. R.
Dacey, J. H. Cann, Donald Macdonell, Fred
Flowers, Niels Nielsen, J. L. Trefle and Alf

Take out a policy with the Government
Insurance Office, 473 Bourke-street, Melbourne,
or with one of the 70 approved insurers under
the Act. Application should be made for a
proposal form.
Translation of “acre perennius,” and to what
language does it belong? —4Bl6.
“More lasting than brass”; Latin.
(1) Origin of the lines:
Love took up the glass of Time and turned it in his
glowing hands.
(2) Who was the composer of:
Sound the loud timbrel o’er Egypt’s dark sea.
—4691.
(1) Tennyson’s “Locksley Hall.” (2) Tom
Moore.
(1) What causes seasickness ? (2) Any way
of preventing it ? (3) Treatment ? —4948.
Exact cause is somewhat obscure, but evi-
dence of over-stimulation in certain branches
of the auditory nerve is obvious in most cases.
Continued agitation of the fluid contained in
the semicircular canals of the internal ear tends
to upset equilibrium, with nausea and vomiting
as a result. In adopting a treatment this
balance sense demands attention. Main require-
ments are to diminish the activity of nerve
cells and nerves concerned; prevent or curtail
movements of the ear canal fluids (mechanical
limitation) and to treat acidosis or any source
of gastric irritation before embarking. As a
precautionary measure, take frequent aperient
salines, and remain in the open air as far as
possible. If feeling sick or disinclined for food,
take two teaspoons of equal parts of brandy
and fresh lemon-juice in a little water, as re-
quired. Bromide sedatives may be given under
medical supervision.
In the treatment of leprosy a preparation of
chaulmoogra oil is mentioned. What is this,
and how obtained for medicinal use ? —4890.
The true chaulmoogra (gynocardia) oil is
derived by pressure from the seeds of tarak
kurzii, a plant native of Burma. It consists of
a number of unsaturated fatty acids, the chief
of which are chaulmoogric and palmitic acids;
to the former its medicinal properties are due.
In the treatment of leprosy it is of recognised
value, the B.P. ointment being also prescribed
in allied skin lesions. The discovery of water-
soluble products of the oil has led to a
definite advance in treatment within recent
years. Under medical supervision a 3 per cent,
solution of sodium gynocardate is injected into
the muscles, the dose being increased in strength
and frequency as the patient improves. Internal
dosage of the oil is from 3 to 10 minims, thrice
daily.
My climbing roses and crepe myrtle shrub
are covered with a white powderish substance.
What is it; and the remedy ? —4950.
The plants are affected with mildew —a fungus
disease which destroys the vitality. Dust the
foliage with sulphur, or spray with a mixture
of loz. liver of sulphur (potassium sulphide)
diluted in two gallons of water. Both treat-
ments should be given in early morning since
the warm sun helps considerably in the clean-
up.
How to propagate lavender ? Is there any
sale for this perfume in Sydney ? —4927.
Pieces of hardened new wood stripped from
the parent plant and leaving a “heel” will
root readily in sandy loam. If a glass frame
is used there will be few failures. The rooted
cutting should not be moved into the open
garden for six months. Anthony Horderns,
Farmers, David Jones and some of the
novelty florists should be likely purchasers.
The quality of the blooms and the way the
sachets are made will be deciding factors in
the sale of the lavender.
In Strathfield (N.S.W.) I have gerbera clumps
which have been undivided for years, and the
flowers are getting smaller. (1) When is the
best time to divide them ? (2) If not now, how
should I treat them ? (3) How to handle seed ?
(4) How many colors are there of gerberas ?
4987.
(1) In October, when all danger of frost is
over; allow 24in. between the plants when re-
setting. (2) Plenty of water, with weekly doses
of liquid manure, should give better blooms.
Top-dressing with rotted manure is also helpful,
but be careful not to cover the crown of the
plant, from which the flowers come. (3) Ger-
bera seed should be sown when fresh, preferably
as soon as it is ripenend on the plant. Use
sandy loam, and press each seed pointed-end
downwards, with the fluff-end on the top of the
soil. Cover the boxes with whitewashed glass,
and keep well watered in a warm position. (4)
Colors catalogued are red, rose, salmon, white
yellow, orange, violet and scarlet.
What are the varieties of perennial statice,
and how are the flowers dried ? —4990.
Chief varieties are Perezii (large leaves and
lavender-blue flowers), Dicksonii (vieux-rose
flowers; requires plenty of room to spread),
Arborea (blue-mauve flowers), Latifolia (small
lavender blooms carried on tall stalks, and very
effective for cutting), Caspia (small fernlike
foliage with sprays of pale-violet blooms),
Dumosa (small leaves with silver-grey flowers)
and Incana (pink and white blooms). To dry
the flowers cut them when nearly open and
hang them head down. Do not place the
flowers in water or it will cause the stems to
rot.
A small globule of mercury has found its way
past one of the moving indexes {of the magnet-
set type) of a maximum-minimum thermometer,
with the result that the maximum reading is
slightly too low. How can I coax it back ?
—4BlB.
The mercury column can usually be re-
united by vigorously swinging the thermometer,
holding the bottom of the U tube containing
the mercury downwards. Care should be taken
to prevent jerks. If impossible to adjust, the
correction to be applied should be half the
length of the detached globule of mercury in
degrees —the correction being a plus correction
to the maximum reading and a minus cor-
rection to the minimum reading. In time the
globule of mercury may gravitate back, so that
the error should be checked daily before read-
ing.
(1) Average weight of dried fins and tail from
a shark ? (2) Price paid for dried shark fins
and tails in Sydney and China ? (3) Price
paid in Sydney for dried shark flesh ? (4)
Method of drying fins and tails ? (5) Method
of drying flesh ? —4772.
(1) About 270 z. The tiger shark averages
about 420 z., the whaler 19oz. and the grey
nurse 20oz. The dorsal, two pectorals and
lower lobe of caudal (tail) fin alone are of com-
mercial value. (2) From 2s. 6d. to 3s. per
pound. (3) There is no market in Sydney for
dried shark flesh. There is a market in Singa-
pore, but quotations are not available. (4)
Fins are simply dried ip the sun supported
above the ground on wire-netting. No pre-
liminary treatment, except washing in salt
water, is required. (5) Flesh may be dried
in sun after soaking in brine or, preferably,
in patent dehydrators.
(1) Mixture for coating metal receptacles to
be used for developing photographs ? (2)
Would ordinary tinning be suitable ? (3) A
suitable cement for celluloid ? (4) Would this
cement resist the action of Kodak developing
powders ? —4907.
(1) Botanite, from Nock and Kirby, Sydney,
2s. a tin. (2) Would not recommend it. Proper
developing dishes may be purchased at a very
small cost. (3) Duco cement, Is. per tube.
(4) Yes.
(1) Method of operation of ice-making
machines using two metal spheres to which heat
is applied ? (2) Operation of electrical refriger-
ating machines of the household type ?— 4841.
(1) The original apparatus consisted of two
iron vessels connected by a pipe. In one vessel
liquid ammonia was put and heat applied,
the other vessel being placed in cold water. At
a sufficiently high temperature liquefaction took
place in the second vessel, the evaporation
being continued until sufficient ammonia had
passed over. The heat was then removed and
a basin of cold water substituted for that used
for condensing. Rapid evaponation followed,
the abstraction of heat from the water in the
surrounding vessel being sufficient to convert
the water into ice. (2) In the compressor
system, which is widely used, a |-h.p. electric
motor, automatically controlled by a thermo-
stat, drives the compressor which commences
the cycle of operation. The refrigerant in the
cooling coils (sulphur dioxide) vaporises, and
in so doing extracts heat from its surroundings,
having done which it leaves the cabinet and
passes through a copper tube to the electrically-
driven compressor which converts the gas back
into a liquid. The heat is released and the
liquid refrigerant is then readmitted to the
cooling coil, so extracting more heat and re-
peating the process.
How can I obtain a copy of a certificate
of birth of a person born in New York in
1838, and approximate cost ? —4794.
Birth certificates are not procurable for births
occurring in New York State prior to 1880.

“G.”: Not to be outdone by the
Yankees who plough the cotton into the
ground, the British Government is con-
sidering the elimination of “surplus
spindles” in the cotton industry “for
the duration of the depression and
six months thereafter.” The idea of put-
tings things right in a time of depres-
sion by hampering production looks like
one of the discoveries of Alice in Won-
derland.

“Canny Lad”: Britons have always
been accustomed to regard the Soccer
football heads in England as the lead-
ing buyers of slave labor, but, as usual,
Amurrica has gone better. A base-
ball player has been purchased by Boston
Red Sox for £30,000 on a five-year con-
tract. This makes the £10,000 which is
the English Soccer record sound like
chicken-feed, and leads one to wonder
what the gentleman would have brought

Note from “13th Batt.”: —
A significant item appeared in Sydney
“D.T.”: —
“Being a crooner is not always fun.
Dick Powell enjoyed his daily fencing prac-
tice with Mary Brian until his studio
recently heard of it. No more fencing for
Dick —singers must not run the risk of
being scarred.”
Movie ballyhoo, of course; but for that very
reason valuable proof of the feminisation of
the male sex, which is perhaps the most striking
sociological phenomenon of the post-war era.
The vogue of the crooner whose beauty is
more important than that of a woman-star; of
the elderly pacifist who is proud of never
having been to a war; of the undergrad, who
is pledged to be a C.O. if his country is
attacked is closely related to the vogue of the
woman-cricketer and woman-flier.

“El Verdugo”: Having read Monash’s
memoirs, may I say a word or two for
Wellington and Napoleon?: —
My [Monash’s] command is more than
two and a half times the size of the
British army under the Duke of Welling-
ton, or of the French army under Napoleon
Bonaparte at the Battle of Waterloo.
Wellington, when he went to the Penin-
sula, did not see home again for four
years. No destroyers waited to take him
on short leave. He left London a knight
and came back a duke. Most of his
campaigning life was spent on horse-
back, or in village rooms on a diet of
cold beef or mutton. He had no tele-
phones—even the semaphore was a com-
paratively new invention —and occasion-
ally a light division had to rush 60 miles
in 20 hours to save the situation. His
army was not the flower of the nation’s
manhood. It consisted largely of “great
scoundrels.... the sweepings of the
streets.” He had no modern shipping or
railway service—he provisioned his army
in the field. And he had worries which
no modern corps commander ever heard
of. Transport was mostly by bullock ;
there were nearly 600,000 pack animals,
with an army of 40,000, in his first Indian
campaign with Lord Harris. Napoleon’s
little lot frequently had worse handicaps
to encounter. One injured officer, apolo-
gising to the Duke for a defeat, re-
marked, “Well, anyway, you have an
army; we have a moving house of ill
fame.”

“General Prac.”: Is there watertight
evidence that syphilis (B. 19/12/’34)
attacked Europe or Africa in ancient
days? The Egyptian Survey Department
has dug its spades into cemeteries dating
back 5000 years, and in no case that I
have read about have the bones and
mummies shown signs of the Red
flague. And the Greek and Roman satir-
es, close observers all, can never have
seen or heard of the disease. The truth
is that Columbus left Haiti with a crew
almost out of action with syphilis, to
anchor in Palos in 1493. Pinzen, his
second-in-command, with his ship’s com-
pany likewise tainted, got off his course
and made a landfall at Bayonne. Then
a new page was written in the medical
history of Europe. I’ve read an essay
which pointedly suggests that* Christopher
himself died of general paralysis of the
insane ; and we all know what causes
that.
“Ascalon”: There is at least one
weighty objection to the theory that
Columbus and his seamen brought
syphilis to Europe from the West
Indies. Their activities in the New
World brought them in contact only with
a virile and primitive people, the Caribs.
.aces of the kind, untouched by outside
influences, do not evolve diseases like
syphilis. To me, as a layman, a much
more credible proposition is that the Cru-
saders brought it back from the Levant,
those acquainted with conditions pre-
in the insanitary and non-hygienic
East to-day will agree that they
must have been far worse when Cross
and Crescent battled for the possession of
me Holy Land.

“Esters”: A French scientist has dis-
covered a method of disposing of some
of the huge wine surplus under which
France is groaning. He has found that,
fed to horses with bran, or even chatf,
wine has a greater tonic effect than
mangers of oats, and that horses not only
work better but put on weight under a
wine regime. Not content with his tri-
umphs in this field, Professor Girey has
now turned his attention to the carnivora.
Already he claims he has converted a
lion to vegetarianism by giving it wine
mixed with wheat, another of France’s
excess products. The nature of the wine
employed is not stated, though vin or-
dinaire could hardly produce such
miraculous results. If it had been pinkie,
now, one would hesitate to set a limit to
its possible effects —either upon a horse
or a lion.

HOW SKIDS CAN BE AVOIDED ON
GREASY ROADS.
WHERE THE NOVICE DRIVER ERRS.
By FRED BERRY.
| 1 HOUGH recent heavy rains may have gladdened the heart
of the farmer, they have had an entirely different signifi-
cance to the motorist—an apt illustration of one man’s meat
being another man’s poison. Thousands of new drivers have
experienced their first motoring thrill by reason of these uncom-
fortable conditions, and drivers more experienced have had to
bring all their skill to bear in order to avoid accidents.
Incidentally, the dreadful state of the
roads has proved in a most convincing
manner that there still are a great many
drivers who either do not or will not
realise that such awkward conditions
demand great care and very skilful
handling if one wishes to proceed with
A striking illustration of skid correction in a Continental
road race. The driver on the extreme right has taken the
corner too fast, and is steering into the skid in order to
line up the car.
safety. Every driver should realise that,
if mishaps are to be avoided, there are
only two ways of learning how a car
may be successfully driven on greasy
roads. The first is by bitter experience
of an accident in which the car is
smashed and the passengers are terrified ;
the second is by taking sound advice be-
forehand and putting that advice into
practice until such time as the confidence
and knowledge born of experience are
fully acquired.
Why Cars Skid.
An experienced and skilful driver, un-
less actually racing, seldom permits his
car to develop a skid when driven over
wet or greasy roads. Skids may be
placed in three general groups, depending
upon (a) condition of road and tyres ; ( b)
centre of gravity of the car and weight
distribution; (c) error of judgment on
the part of driver.
A good concrete road and a car shod
with bold-patterned tyres offer an ideal
anti-skid combination, providing maxi-
mum road grip. On the other hand,
smooth tyres on a clay surface after
rain render driving extremely risky. The
liability to skid is directly dependent on
the condition of tyres and roadway, and
for the information of new drivers the
order of safety of roads under varying
conditions is concrete, macadam, gravel,
tar and dirt road. Unmade clay in coun-
try districts and wet neuchatel in city
areas run a bad last.
Centre of gravity and distribution of
weight are intimately connected. The
lower the centre of gravity of any given
car the more easily it can be steered
under adverse conditions, other factors
being normal. The modern automobile
with down-swept frame and small wheels
is immeasurably easier to handle than the
ancient large-wheel type.
Placing Luggage.
Weight distribution is a matter in some
degree under the control of the person
in charge of the car. In stowing lug-
gage it should be known that heavy
weights located on the luggage grid tend
to provoke a pendulum action on
corners. Not only is skidding and “yaw-
ing” aggravated,
but, what is equally
imporant, correc-
tion of steering
errors is far more
difficult than would
be the case with
the luggage dis-
posed on the run-
ning-boards or in
the body of the car.
The human error
may now be con-
sidered. Though
speed is a factor, it
does not neces-
sarily follow that
speed alone is re-
sponsible for skidding. A confident
driver will negotiate a long stretch of
wet clay surface at an even gait and get
away with it without the slightest diffi-
culty, while under identical conditions a
nervous man will fiddle about with
accelerator and brakes and, after jazzing
about for a while, will finish up ig-
nominiously in the ditch. The golden
rule when driving over wet or greasy
roadway is to leave the brake pedal
severely alone and regulate speed so as to
“drift” up to corners, and in extreme
cases to give that little extra throttle
opening that will help the car round.
Careless Braking.
Braking on greasy corners is futile
because the friction or “grip” between
tyres and road is so small that it is
almost a mechanical impossibility to so
adjust brakes or loading that equal de-
celeration will be given under these exact-
ing conditions. On dry roads a few
pounds’ variation in brake tension is
neither here nor there, but in grease or
slippery conditions the slightest variation,
even in the tyre tread, will result in one
wheel locking and skidding, with the
others rolling—-with the inevitable con-
sequence.
We’ll suppose the car has started to
skid. Should brakes be on, let them go
at once and steer into the skid. If the
throttle was open when the trouble
started, close it and steer into the skid —
but don’t apply the brakes.
Perhaps every motorist has at some
time heard of “steering into a skid” in
order to correct it, but few realise
exactly the purport of the advice. To
make the position quite clear, let us
assume that, driving along a wet or
treacherous road surface, the rear wheels
suddenly decide to skid to the right.
Steering into the skid means that now
the driver must instantly turn the wheel
to the right, but only far enough to per-
mit the car to “line up” on a straight
course, and then quickly bring it to
centre again.
Learning the Art.
Much, of course, depends upon the
driver’s skill in determining exactly how
much wheel to give and for how long—
in practice a matter of split seconds.
Those who sincerely desire to learn the
art should carry out a little deliberate
skidding practice in some quiet street,
and so instil a sense of confidence that
will prove of great assistance at some
future time.
In handling a car on greasy roads there
is one other matter disturbing to the
novice, and that is in regard to climbing
long hills when the road surface is un-
metalled and slippery. Generally these
nervous drivers get into low gear
ai the foot of the hill, and are
hopelessly stuck before they are half-
way up. It is far better to tackle
the grade either in top or middle
gear and use as little throttle as possible
in order to keep the car moving—the
object being to avoid spinning the wheels
and so losing traction. It will be found
that by doing this seemingly impossible
surfaces and grades can be successfully
negotiated without having recourse to
chains or outside assistance.
200 M.P.H. WITH A FIVE-LITRE ENGINE.
The enormous progress made during
the last year in the power output of
automobile engines and in body design
and suspension is revealed by recent per-
formances of what may be termed stock
racing cars.
When the late Sir Henry Segrave first
passed the 200 mark in official land-speed
records the car used was an extremely
costly affair, specially built for the
attempt and quite useless for any other
purpose, while the engine had a cylinder
capacity of almost 30 litres.
Now both Mercedes and Auto Union
An “Autocar” impression of R. Caracciola breaking class records on the
Gydr road in a Grand Prix Mercedes at a speed of almost 200 m.p.h.
(German) Grand Prix road-racing
machines with cylinder capacities of less
than five litres have been knocking at
the door of the 200-m.p.h. mark.
Caracciola, driving a Mercedes on a
narrow strip of road only 20ft. wide at
Gyor, near Budapest, averaged the extra-
ordinary speed of 197.26 m.p.h. over a
flying kilometre, and 196.92 m.p.h. over
the flying mile, proving the splendid
roadability of these extraordinary cars.
The Auto Union, also a Grand Prix
type, established the stupendous perform-
ance of averaging 101.37 m.p.h. from a
standing start over a measured kilometre,
the speed across the finishing line being
estimated at about 215 m.p.h.
In the small classes similar astonishing
times have been recorded. Denley,
driving a supercharged 750 c.c. (7-h.p.)
Midget, averaged 128.62 m.p.h. over a
kilometre. Mrs. Stewart, with a 1600
c.c. (14-h.p., R.A.C. rating) engine in a
front-wheel-drive chassis, clocked 147.79
m.p.h.
Safety-first Ideas in U.S.A.
In an endeavor to increase the percent-
age of safe cars operating on the high-
ways and to reduce the number of acci-
dents due to faulty equipment a number
of States in the U.S.A. have been setting
an excellent example.
In Australia and most other countries
it remains for the individual to decide
when and where repairs or adjustments
are to be made to his car, and as a con-
sequence a huge number of machines are
continually being driven in a dangerous
and unsafe condition. It is extremely
interesting therefore to peruse the latest
statistics issued by seven American States
in which during the last year 3,019,873
vehicles were inspected. Under the
American scheme every registered car
must at least once in each year call at
the official testing plant for a free check-
ing over. Of more than 3,000,000 cars
examined 54.5 p.c. had bad headlights,
34.9 p.c. required brake repairs and
adjustments, 5.4 p.c. had defective wind-
screen wipers, 5.1 p.c. required adjust-
ments to steering gear, 3.9 p.c. had faulty
horns and 2.1 p.c, had broken or mis-
placed mirrors. As each and every one
of these defects could, in certain circum-
stances, be responsible for an accident, it
must be admitted that a “safety-first”
inspection along similar lines would be
for the general good of motoring in this
country.


MOTOR ODDITIES.
Motorists are invited to write to “The Bulletin” and
recount any interesting or novel experiences; these,
where accepted, will be published under “Motor
Oddities.”
Thrills and extraordinary driving experiences have not
been confined to racing and competition drivers, while
outback mechanics, with typical Australian ingenuity,
have worked miracles in getting their cars home.
Descriptions of ancient motors still in service; drivers
with huge mileages to their credit, and details of diffi-
cult and hazardous journeys are among subjects of
interest to readers of “The Steering Column.”
FREE SERVICE TO
MOTORISTS.
Information or advice upon all
motoring subjects is available

Fatal Crash in Centenary Road
Race.
Australia’s premier road race, the 300-
mile Centenary Handicap held at Cowes
(Vic.) on New Year’s Day, was won by L.
Murphy, driving an M.G., in 4hr, 32min.
4sec. Fastest time was established by
Williamson (Riley Imp.), averaging better
than 70 m.p.h. Dry conditions made the
course extremely dusty, and as a conse-
quence the race from the spectators’ view-
point was the most sensational ever wit-
nessed. Coming into corners from the
straights at 100 m.p.h. almost every driver
misjudged the conditions and shielded
dangerously. Bill Thompson (N.S.W.),
the favorite, in a Magnetic K 3, overshot
Beaven Corner, left the road and tore
through the scoring-board, both he and
his mechanic sustaining minor injuries.
Worse was to follow, for Graham, driv-
ing an M.G. Midget, left the road on one
of the fast straights, the car on full
throttle moving at nearly 100 m.p.h.
In the crash both driver and mechanic,
Peters, were so seriously injured that they
died while being conveyed to hospital.
Final placings were:
L. Murphy (M.G.), Ist.
E. Williamson (Riley Imp.), 2nd and
fastest time.
L. Jennings (Magna), 3rd.
L. Jackson (Singer), 4th.
Motor Oddities.
“Gunga Din”; In 1922 when I was
driving a Regal taxi in Bendigo I took
half a dozen competitors to a sports meet-
ing at Daylesford. The day was hot, and
on the trip over I had eight punctures.
The seventh used up the last spare tube
and patch. When the eighth came along
I went to a cocky’s place and begged
enough wheat to fill the tyre, wet it and
waited for half an hour or so. This
saved the walls of the tyre, and got me to
Daylesford, over Breakneck Gorge as
well.

“Kojonup”: Here’s another Rolls-
Royce legend. An R.A.F. officer in
Palestine was granted leave, and on his
way through Cairo was nosing around
the garages looking for a cheap car to
take to England. Seeing an old ruin in
a corner of one garage he asked the
owner what he wanted for it, but was
told the car was no good and wouldn’t
go. However, it changed hands for the
equivalent of £25. It had some of the
hall-marks of a Rolls-Royce, and on
arrival in England Mr. Air Force trucked
it to the Rolls works to see what they
could do with it and followed it up in
person. He was met by the manager and
shown into the showroom, where it was
explained that when Royce first started
Where nuts are likely to work
loose and studs too short to take

securely locked by using a
centre punch as illustrated.
he made three cars, giving one to the
Hon. C. S. Rolls, at that time a famous
racing motorist, and one to another
friend, keeping the third for his' own use.
Rolls was so impressed with his that the
famous firm was the result. No. 1 and
No. 3 were in the firm’s museum, and
the one picked up in Cairo was No. 2.
Would Mr. Air Force take his pick out
of the showroom in exchange? He did.
The Trouble Lamp.
E.S.C. (Wallsend, N.S.W.). —During the last
few months the gears in my car have had a ten-
dency to jump out of engagement when climb-
ing hills. In neutral position there is a distinct
whirring noise, which stops on declutching
and engaging bottom gear. Cause and cure ?
Either the selector arm on the change-speed
lever inside the gearbox is bent, the spring
behind the locking ball has lost its tension, or
gearshaft bearings are badly worn—perhaps a
combination of all
three. The whirring
noise indicates in-
sufficient travel of
pinions when shifted
by the selector rod,
leaving gears partly
touching instead of
neutral. Remove the
inspection plate from
the top of the box,
place gear lever in
third-speed position,
and, using a thin
strip of clean wood
as a lever, push the
selector yoke further
towards third posi-
tion. If you hear a
distinct click it will
prove the trouble
is as suggested,
and the selector
mechanism will have to be removed and
straightened.
R.L. (Healesville, Vic.). —Have fitted a car
radio to a 1934 six-cylinder American car, and
as it takes a lot of current the generator charge
was increased to 15 amps. Now the charge has
dropped to 10 amps., although the third brush
is still in the advanced position and the gener-
ator is perfectly clean. What’s the trouble ?
Your generator is fitted with an automatic
voltage regulator which has apparently ceased
to function. Best plan is to have this fault
rectified rather than further advance the third
brush.
D.B. (Henley, S.A.). —I have an almost new
car which I wish to store for six months. What
precautions should he taken to maintain it in
good condition ?
Best plan would be to arrange for the car
to be taken for a 10-mile run once each month
and cleaned and polished in a regular manner.
Otherwise the car should be jacked up from
the ground and blocks placed under the axles.
Remove battery, and leave with a charging
station for care and attention. Take off tyres
and store in a dark, cool room. Drain all
petrol from tank, fuel lines and carburettor.
Unscrew spark plugs, pour in a tablespoonful
of lubricating oil through plug hole and turn
engine over half a dozen times by starting
handle. Leave radiator full of clean water,
smear exposed plated ware and aluminium fit-
tings with good-quality grease and protect
the whole vehicle from sunlight and dust by
covering with large tent fly or tarpaulin.
W.D. (Windsor, N.S.W.). —I have recently
bought a 1925 model Brooklands Alvis. What
is the most suitable jet size and valve clear-
ance for maximum speed ?
Main jet 120 and compensator 45 in the solex
carburettor. O.H. valves should be adjusted
to four-thousandths clearance while motor is
hot. Make certain the rounded ends of push
rods are not worn unevenly, otherwise valve
settings will vary.
A.N.N. (Southport, Q.). —My four-cylinder
1-h.p. car will run beautifully for perhaps two
months; then it begins missing badly. Car-
burettor is properly adjusted, and have checked
valves, timing, etc. The defect disappears when
the magneto is removed and cleaned, but
always shows up again intermittently. What’s
wrong ?
If you remove the distributor cover from the
magneto and inspect with a strong glass you
will probably find a minute crack in the vul-
canite. This becomes filled with finely divided
particles of carbon from the central brush, and
allows the current to jump to two or more
plugs simultaneously. Cleaning temporarily
corrects the defect, but the only certain remedy
is to repair the crack with wax or fit a new
distributor casing:
L.E.B. (Five Dock, N.S.W.). —You have ad-
vised keeping cooling-water temperature at 180
degrees for greatest efficiency. My six-cylinder
car seldom shows higher than 140, even when
driven hard on hot days. Can this be adjusted
to show 180 degrees ?
The thermostat between the radiator and
cylinder block can be dismantled and the
hexagonal nut inside the casting given a full
turn to increase tension of spring. A few
experiments may be necessary before the exact
running temperature is secured. Alteration Of
fan-blade pitch is not to be recommended.
A.N.P. (Tenterfield, N.S.W.).— The offside
rear tyre on my car wears very quickly. I
am told it is due to a bent axle. Can the
trouble be rectified by straightening the axle, and
should the job be done cold or by heat ?
Unless the specification of the steel in the
bent shaft is positively known, any process of
straightening, particularly where heat is used,
is a'risky undertaking. The axle may become
brittle, and almost certainly any latent fracture
will be magnified. It would be cheapest in the
long run to fit a new axle shaft.
W.A. (Wollongong, 'N.S.W.).—Since my 1930
six-cylinder car at 23,000 miles was given an
engine overhaul I cannot get satisfactory run-
ning at low speed or idling. I have carefully
checked settings of carburettor, which has not
been interfered with. Valve clearances are
correct, as are plugs, ignition and timing.
At high speed the car pulls well, but when
idling in the garage rather more water than cus-
tomary is ejected from the tail pipe. Can you
suggest trouble ?
Assuming all mechanical adjustments have
been correctly made, it seems likely that a
faulty gasket in the cylinder head is letting
water enter the combustion chamber and short
the plugs. If a new gasket was not fitted at
last overhaul you should lift the heads and
check this.
A.H. (Corfield, Q.).-(l) My 1926 Dodge has
a distinct piston slap, and I intend to have the
cylinders rebored when reaching Brisbam.
Would it be advisable to take up the bearings
before doing the 1000-mile trip ? (2) Would
it be reasonably safe to drive at 25 to 30 m.p.h.
in this condition ? (3) In putting new acid in
the battery, is any distilled water added ?
(1) If bearings are very slack you could
have a shim or two taken from each big-end
cap with perfect safety. (2) No reason to drive
otherwise than at normal touring speed. (3)
Never add acid to battery; merely replace
evaporated liquid with distilled water. Battery
acid is a mixture of pure sulphuric acid and
distilled water having a specific gravity of be-
tween 1280 and 1300, but in using this always
make certain of throwing away the old electro-
lyte.
W.S. (Athol, N.S.W.). —When I throw out the
clutch on my four-cylinder Whippet, which has
run 12,000 miles, there is a peculiar screeching
noise. Cause and cure ?
Either the clutch withdraw mechanism is
badly worn or it is partly seized. Dismantle
the clutch for inspection.
J.W. (Roma, Q.). —(1) What , is the year
of my Morris Cowley tourer (engine number
given) ? (2) The front axle has been heated
and now bends easily. Can the temper be
restored or a good repair made ? (3) The
alloy pistons wear the cylinders very quickly.
Would cast-iron be satisfactory, and who sup-
plies in Sydney ?
(1) Can’t tell from number. Write to Morris
Motors, Cowley, England. (2) Best plan would
be to reinforce by spot-welding a strip of
metal across the weak section. (3) Cast-iron
pistons will give good service, but acceleration
and maximum speed will be somewhat alfected.
J.C.G. (Millaa Millaa, Q.).—Name of a
periodical dealing with British motor-cycles in
a general manner ?

SHORT-WAVE PROS AND CONS.
By DON B. KNOCK.
No. 4.
The simplest of all short-wave receivers is the familiar regenerative
detector and audio amplifier. This is much improved by the addition of
a tuned R.F. stage, with the advantages of better sensitivity and elimination
of “tuning holes.” The method of coupling the R.F. stage to the detector
can be one of a few, the differences between which are discussed here.
Even in these days of all-wave and
short-wave superhets with imposing valve
arrays the humble kind of short-wave
receiver in which an oscillating detector
does the major share of the work can

Fig. 2.
hold its own. Admittedly, it is not the
kind of receiver to put into inexperienced
hands, but it is, nevertheless, capable of
excellent results, particularly if it incor-
porates a tuned R.F. stage, which is stable
and really does amplify. This ideal state
of affairs is only possible when there is
no interlocking between the two stages.
The method of coupling can contribute
to this considerably, but first and fore-
most it should be understood that, where
tuned R.F. is used for short waves, shield-
ing between the two stages must be com-
plete, and not a half-hearted attempt.
Theoretically, the whole of the assembly
comprising the R.F. portion should
be totally enclosed in a metal box, and
the side of the box nearest the detector
should have a double wall with a space
of |in. or more. In practice, according to
the physical arrangement of the com-
ponents and the way in which coupling is
effected, shielding need not be so drastic,
arid the precautions as taken in the
Wide-World Four (B. 18/7/’34 and B.
2/l/’35) are sufficient.
Fig. 1 shows one way of coupling the
R.F. stage. This was widely used in the
days when the advantages of T.R.F.
for short waves were becoming apparent.
It is about the simplest method of all,
and comprises a tuned impedance. This
impedance is the existing grid coil of the
detector circuit, but it has the disadvan-
tage that it carries the plate voltage for
the R.F. valve. The condenser Cl, con-
nected between the plate-voltage supply
and the earth, enables the continued use
of the detector grid tuning condenser with
the rotor earthed. This isolating conden-
ser is important, and, in order that there
should be no question of leakage, a good
mica dielectric type must be used. The
capacity need not
be larger than .002
mfd. What really
happens in this
arrangement is that
the detector is un-
tuned, and the
plate of the R.F.
valve is tuned. The
grid condenser,
.0001 mfd., must
also be faultless,
otherwise a posi-
tive potential will
find its way to the
grid of the detec-
tor, with result-
ant howling and
squawking. Leak-
age , here would
also produce un-
controllable oscil-
lation effects. Another point is that the
tuning condenser must be beyond re-
proach, as a little reflection will show that
there is a voltage potential difference be-
tween the rotor and stator plates, and
this may be anything from 90 to 200
volts. Any sign of rubbing contacts,
loose bearings or loose connections and
the receiver will give forth the most dis-
tracting splutters and crackles.
Modified Tuned-impedance Coupling.
Because tuning is apparently much
sharper on short waves than the regular
broadcast waves many people have the
idea that selectivity is of little importance.
This is far from being the case. The
tuned-impedance method of R.F. coup-
ling outlined is notoriously poor for selec-
tivity. It can, however, be somewhat
improved, as in Fig. 2. Here the plate
of the R.F. valve is connected to a mid-
point tap on the plate impedance in-
stead of direct to the grid end of the
coil. The tap may be taken at the centre
of the coil, or a variety of taps can be
provided and changes tried. The coil
thus becomes an auto-transformer, and
an extra load is placed upon it, but the
effect is that the selectivity improves.
For a permanent connection such as this
a plug-in coil with five pins will be
needed, four only being necessary for
the previous scheme.
Capacity Coupling.
In Fig. 3 is shown a method which is
simple but is capable of very stable re-
sults. This is really tuned-grid coupling,
and is the method used in the Wide-
World Four, referred to previously. Here
the plate circuit of the R.F. amplifier is
entirely isolated from the detector grid
circuit. Another plate impedance is pro-
vided in the form of a radio-frequency
choke, but any old kind of choke will
not serve the purpose. It must have a
low self-capacity, and for this reason
one of the three-section chokes now
manufactured for short-wave uses is re-
commended. With this tuned-grid coup-
ling the detector is working normally.
Results are about even with' those of the
tuned-plate-impedance method, but minus
the disadvantages. If the receiver is prop-
erly laid out with regard to shielding the
R.F. stage tuning does not unduly “pull”
the detector, A signal may be tuned-in
with the detector, and the R.F. dial
rotated, with very little adjustment neces-
sary finally. A variation of this coup-
ling similar to Fig. 2 can be tried, with
the condenser taken to a tap on the grid
coil instead of the top. This condenser
must, again, be leakage-free, and quite
a small capacity is all that is required ;
20 mmfd. is usually ample, but in very
completely-screened receivers capacities
as high as .01 mfd. have been used with-
out interlocking.
Primary Coupling.
This method is the familiar and stand-
ard one as used for broadcast-receiver
couplings. An entirely separate primary
winding is used in inductive relation to
the detector-grid coil as in Fig. 4.
It can be applied to short waves quite
well, but the method calls for some care-
ful construction in coil design. The
grid coil and primary should be space-
wound, with the primary wound in be-
Fig. 5.
tween the turns of the grid coil for best
results. Usually, the primary needs about
one-third the number of turns of the
grid coil. Also, it is necessary to use
6-pin coils, but that, of course, is no dis-
advantage. Some experimentation will
be needed to obtain the correct amount
of primary coupling for smooth work-
ing, but when everything is as it should
be this method will take a lot of beating.
Primary-reaction Coupling.
Finally, in Fig. 5 is shown the circuit
diagram of a three-valve battery receiver
using two-volt valves and with an unusual
form of coupling. Here the detector
feed-back coil is in the screen-grid cir-
cuit, and is used also as the primary
coupling for the R.F. stage. In practice
it works out very well, and can be re-
commended. Regeneration is controlled
in the screen grid, and this is now fami-
liar to most short-wave students. An
important point is that the condenser C 6
must be a small capacity ; 40 mmfd. is
ample, and .0001 mfd. the most neces-
sary. If any readers have the idea that
by making this condenser variable it can
become the regeneration control, it is
better forgotten, for the receiver would
be cranky and fussy to control owing to
excessive detuning effects. An advan-
tage of this method of R.F. coupling is
the very smooth regeneration control
possible in the detector, but it cannot
be employed with the more recent elec-
tron-coupled detector, as in the Wide-
World receivers described by the writer.

SOME CURRENT OPERATIC FARE.
Quite a lot of opera is being broad-
casted (horrible word) in Australia just
now, and conflicting opinions about it
are likely to exercise many minds in
addition to those of the professional
critics. There has
been a disposition
lately to condemn
opera out of hand
as being an inartis-
tic anomaly. The
basis of this con-
demnation is the
unnaturalness of
the operatic presen-
tation of life. No-
body, say the ob-
jectors, having just
murdered his
grandmother,
would stand up
and sing a song
about it, and
people don’t solilo-
quise by hurling
bunches of semi-
quavers at the welkin. The answer
to all this is very logical. In no art
form is there, of necessity, any slavish
devotion to everyday manners. Nobody
speaks in verse, but we don’t condemn
the plays of Shakspeare or such first-
person narrative poems as the “Ancient
Mariner” on that score. Opera is as old
or older than the drama; perhaps as old
as poetry. It is an accepted form, and
we have to put up with it. If you find
you can’t you may take comfort in the
fact that you stand with Addison, Steele
and Goethe, among other famous critics
who condemned the form as monstrous
and ridiculous.
There is a philosophical, as apart from
the purely aesthetic, objection to opera
which is worthy of thought. Music, say
those who take the philosophic line of
attack, is the one art which gives “release
from the world of light”—has no de-
pendence on color or form, and' to add
these to it in any way is a work of
supererogation. But, save to the blind,
are not musical memories inextricably
mixed with visual impressions—Paderew-
ski’s glorious mop of hair and phenomen-
ally long fingers ; Clara Butt’s “spacious
presence which seems to fill the scene,”
as was said of another great lady ; the
rapt, seraphic mien of Jascha Heifetz,
and so on?
Having decided to accept opera, what
is to be said about it? Let’s take a few
of the music-dramas that are to be on
the air in the near future, or which have
just been heard. First there’s “Aida,” a
favorite season-opener. Verdi wrote it
on a commission from the Khedive of
Egypt—hence the Egyptian subject—and
it was first performed in Cairo in 1871.
As a Verdi opera it is a washout. From
Verdi the public has learned to expect
melody, and in “Aida” there are only
two melodies that can readily be re-
membered—“ Celeste Aida” and the
march in which long trumpets tradition-
ally make their appearance. But the
orchestration is remarkably rich, climaxes
of emotion are skilfully and effectively
worked up, and the piece enables cos-
tumiers and scene painters to spread
themselves to the limit. It has been said
that this opera shows Wagner’s influence.
That may be; “Tannhauser” and
“Lohengrin” had been before the public
for over 20 years when “Aida” was com-
posed. Anyway, the musical content of the
opera is not nearly so popular as that of
“Trovatore” and “Rigoletto,” which are
strings of melodies linked together with
short recitatives and pieces of orchestral
bravura writing. Yet both these operas
hang together much better than the de-
scription would seem to imply. The
music is more or less suited to the words,
and though to ears tuned to Wagner’s
impressive (and long-winded) cadences
such simple airs as “Home to Our Moun-
tains” and “Caro Nome” may appear
trite and even vulgar, and the events of
both “Trovatore” and “Rigoletto” may
appear more comic than pathetic (the

body in the bag certainly runs close to the
brink of bathos), it must not be forgotten
that these things have delighted millions
of not unintelligent and not unmusical
people, and in one form or another they
have still to-day, after eighty years’ ex-
istence, a vastly wider audience than
Wagner’s works can boast. So don’t
sneer at “Trovatore” and “Rigoletto.”
The people who do would be the first to
acclaim as a heaven-born genius any
modern composer who could produce
melodies of comparable worth.
There is only one composer in the line
of the Verdi succession who has gifts
as a melodist and who is included in the
Fuller co.’s programme as at present
whose “Madame But-
terfly” contains one of the most truly
pathetic scenes in all opera, the night-
long vigil of Cio-Cio-San, her maid and
her baby. The music of this scene is not
melodious in the symmetrically figured
Verdi style, but it expresses and illumi-
nates the incident in the play so perfectly
that it affords a powerful argument in
favor of opera. Of course, Butterfly must
be petite, otherwise the radio listener
gets an immeasurably better show than
the folk in the audience.
Gounod’s “Faust” is an old-time favor-
ite that comes in for derision nowadays
on the ground that its music is too
sugary and too trivial. The charge is not
very well founded. The same pen and
the same imagination evolved this
“Faust” as went to the making of the
“Messe Solennelle” and other works
whose lofty dignity goes unchallenged.
The matter for surprise is that such an
ecclesiastically-minded composer should
have handled the love-making scenes
with such complete understanding. The
scenes with Marguerite in the garden are
clothed with music which made a pro-
found impression on Paris when it was
first performed—and Paris was very
critical in 1859.
We come at last to Wagner, whose
“Tannhauser,” “Valkyrie” and “Tristan
and Isolde” figure on the current menu.
Wagner has been credited with having
revolutionised opera, but it would be
more correct to say that he reploughed
a field cultivated by Gluck and left fal-
low for 60 years or so. “The play’s the
thing” with Wagner, and his musical ex-
pression of the ideas in his plays (he was
his own librettist), if sometimes uncouth,
sometimes Germanically heavy and some-
times empty, is characterised on the
whole by the vigor of a bold mind. Wag-
ner was the complete iconoclast and
egoist. His inner driving-force carried
him at times to exalted, heights, at other
times to what can only be described as
pig-headed depths. For a great many
years the public couldn’t make head or
tail of “Tannhauser,” not to speak of the
more recondite operas, but it grew to be
a fashion to applaud these works, and
continued repetition made them familiar.
They were crammed down the public’s
gullet, and after a while the taste was
acquired. Whether it was worth acquir-
ing is now beginning to be questioned,
but there are passages in Wagnerian
opera that even the most bigoted anti-
Wagnerite knows cannot be forgotten.
If he did naught else Wagner made
Europe revise its musical ideas.
A. MAJOR.
Amateur Chatter.
There is nothing much to report
on the amateur bands over the fes-
tive season other than the usual pre-
dominance of greetings flying around
between all and sundry, chiefly on
the 40-metre band. Static is the
great stumbling-block, and this main-
tains its ferocious onslaught with little
sign of diminishing. DX conditions are
decidedly freakish, and Europeans in the
early morning are very much on the weak
side. It is surprising the amount of
trouble some men will go to to erect a
really good transmitting aerial. Summer
B. Young, of W9HCC, told the writer
that he had just erected a new half-wave
system for 40 metres over a swamp ad-
joining his station. To do this it was
necessary to sink piles 40ft. or so into the
ground as a foundation for masts. The
great advantage, of course, is space, and
plenty of it. So many amateur trans-
mitters have to get along with a back-
yard radiating system, and the man with
a lot of spare, unobstructed ground avail-
able for the erection of directional sys-
tems is to be envied. Even with limited
space twisted feeder doublets can be
erected to advantage.
“L.T.E.,” Bombala (N.S.W.), a short-
wave listener, writes: “I find 10 metres
quite interesting. On 22/12/’34 I heard
VK2LZ on ’phone at 2 p.m. working
with a Victorian. The 25th was a good
day. At 9.30 a.m. VK2LZ was QSAS
R 4 on ’phone, but fading badly. He
came up to R 6 at 10 a.m., and from then
until noon I heard lots of them. VK4BB
was working with VK3HK. 488 was
R 6 on C.W. and R 5 on ’phone, but with
hum in the carrier. VK4XN was the
same, but with more fading. A South
Australian was heard, but I forgot to log
his call. At 11.50 ZLIBA was heard
QSA3 R 4 with severe fading. At 5.15
p.m. VK2LZ was R 7 on the speaker.
My experience with short-wave con-
ditions indicates that 10 metres should
be lively soon around midnight, as the
band ‘feels’ or sounds full of life then.
I heard two C.W. stations at 12.30 a.m.
weakly, but they faded before the calls
were heard. VK2LZ’s ’phone is a treat
on 10 metres, and I wonder that this
band is not used more by Australian ex-
perimenters, even if only for local
telephony contacts.”

“Twelve Uses for an R.F. Oscillator”
is the title of an interesting booklet pro-
duced by the Slade-Paton firm, of Croy-
don (N.S.W.). This booklet has the
laudable object of helping the’ radio
dealer and serviceman to gain a know-
ledge of correct use of modern oscilla-
tors and signal generators. Following
the introduction, the pages, with dia-
grams, cover the questions of oscillator
design, shielding, separate modulator
, . . ° . j ,
valves, output meters, dummy antennae,
aligning T.R.F. receivers, neutralising,
aligning intermediate-frequency trans-
formers, procedure of same with' A.V.C.,
oscillator alignment in superhets, deter-
mination of receiver gain, and valve and
selectivity tests. The booklet will be sent
free to any dealer sending his name and
address and a 2d. stamp, to cover post-
age, to Slade-Paton Test Equipment
Manufacturers, Lang-street, Croydon,
N. S. Wales.
The Q. and A. Column.
Am undecided about the best two-volt bat-
tery valve combination for a superhet for the
broadcast band. Five valves should be ample,
and would appreciate a circuit suggestion —2Ol
Illustrated, with necessary values, is the circuit
diagram of a five-valve superheterodyne using
a good combination of valves. The IC6 is
used as detector-oscillator, preceded by a Mul-
lard PMI2M tuned R.F. stage. A similar valve
is used for the I.F. with a PM2DX second de-
tector and PM22A pentode output. 465 or
175 kc. I.F. can be used, the latter preferably
for greater sensitivity. Any good superhet with
an oscillator coil designed for the IC6 can be
used.

NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Saturday fixtures of the Vic. Trotting
and Racing Association were mostly
marred by rain in 1934, and the experi-
ence was repeated on the first 1935 Satur-
day ; the weather at Ascot was shocking.
There was an almost continuous down-
pour, and people returned home drenched
and bedraggled. Ascot deserved better
luck. Prize-money totalled £2OOO, two
of the events being worth £5OO each.
Lou Robertson annexed the Royal
Handicap for two-year-olds with Cotys
(Thracian —Charybdis), a colt bred by
A. T. Creswick. Cotys may have been
lucky to beat Game Keeper, from the
stable of James Scobie. Coming with a
late run, Game Keeper threatened to cut
down Cotys, but the latter hung in and
impeded his rival, who lost by a mere
neck. Stirling, the rider of Game Keeper,
wanted to lodge a protest, but got off
the scales and waited for Scobie before
announcing his intention. Under the
rules of racing his objection could not be
entertained. The stipes found that the
interference was due to the greenness of
both candidates.
Game Keeper belongs to Gerald Buck-
ley, of the Rock House stud, Kyneton,
and is by The Night Patrol from Rosina,
by The Welkin from Seville, by Wallace.
He may go farther on the turf than
Cotys,
Bob Lewis was jubilant when Lilirene
captured the Sandringham Handicap for

Townsville (N.Q.). In the autumn of 1933
Dr. Rountree accompanied Bob to a sale
of yearlings at Yuille’s. A filly by Tri-
valve from Celosia entered the ring. It
had a hugely-enlarged hind leg, and was
knocked down to the doctor for \l\
guineas. Dr. Rountree poulticed the
affected leg for four months, and the
swelling disappeared. Lilirene is a sister
to Nappatara, who made a dead-heat
with Clear Art in the concluding event
at Flemington on New Year’s Day.
Villius faded away in the last furlong
of the V.R.C. Bagot Handicap, won by
Picatus, after having disputed control
with Petau, who also petered out. Both
horses may have been taken to the front
too soon. Villius was ridden an entirely
different race in the Commonwealth
Handicap on Saturday. Apprentice Har-
rison was content for Watchful to make
the running. He joined issue with that
game little thoroughbred half-way down
the straight and came on to score hand-
somely by a couple of lengths. Harrison
claimed 71b. allowance, and this reduced
the impost of Villius to 7st. 21b. Glide-
away had to concede the Gay Lothario
colt 2st., and his owner, former book-
maker J. G. Russell, showed courage in
backing his candidate so solidly against
the winner. Glideaway could not handle
his heavy burden satisfactorily on a rain-
soaked track.

Rogilla is at Randwick once more. It is
intended to restrict him to weight-for-age
racing, but if the handicappers take a
lenient view of his recent failures he may
tackle the Sydney Cup again. Rogilla is
no longer a red chestnut; his color has
lightened remarkably.
* * * *
Winooka ran a fine race in the Carring-
ton Stakes, and his party may let him
have a fly at the Challenge Stakes at
the Randwick Anniversary meeting. He
has the same Weight, lOst. 51b. Obviously
his American trip has not dimmed his
pace.

Stable-mates Theo and Sylvandale are
doing well at Randwick in preparation
for the autumn racing. They will go to
Victoria for the rich three-year-old
events, and will return for the A.J.C.
meeting. Another shaping satisfactorily
is Topical, who will most likely tackle
the Australian Cup, a race he won in
1933.

Silver King is to run in the Caulfield
Futurity Stakes next month, and one of
his opponents will be Arachne. Both are
among tb e re g U i a r workers at Rand-
wick. Walker still holds the opinion
that his colt would have won the last
A.J.C. Derby had he been able to secur
a pacemaker. Arachne will put the a
test on him; she has developed into a
handsome filly, and is the tallest of her
sex m training at Randwick.

The postponement of the Moorefield
meeting until to-morrow was unfortunate
for the club ; however, the programme
remains attractive. The Gold Cup looks
like being a match between Buonarroti
and Koda Pen; both like the course.
This Page prefers Buonarroti.

Rosehill-trained Tingalba has slipped.
At the Randwick meeting he was heavily
supported on two occasions, but dropped
right out in the last furlong. He is now
down in the weights, and perhaps Booth
will try him among the moderates on
suburban tracks. There is nothing wrong
with his appearance.
* * * *
Veteran trainer Ike Foulsham thought
his colt Strathardale should have beaten
Homer in the December Stakes. Ike
has .a high-class sprinter in Kaylah, a
Magpie mare who carried Bst. 121 b. in a
Randwick Novice and won it in most
impressive style. She has been given
7st. 51b. in the Challenge Stakes, and is
already one of the fancies.
“M.A.F.”: Tom Niereker (B. 2/1 /’35)
is not the oldest trainer at Randwick ;
Ike Foulsham is the oldest by far. Ike
trained Malua, winner of the Melbourne
Cup in 1884. He was born in Sydney in
1856. At 12 he was apprenticed to
Honest John Tait.

For some mysterious reason, Sydney
and Melbourne buyers have neglected
Spearfelt yearlings. Four of Spearfelt’s
offspring were among the winners at
Eagle Farm during the holidays, and he
already leads all other Queensland sires,
some with many more representatives
racing. Spearfelt won the Victoria Derby
of 1924, and was third in the Melbourne
Cup that year. Looking back, it is rather
wonderful that he was not first; Back-
wood, the winner, was no great shakes.
That was an unfortunate season for
Spearfelt, for he was just beaten in the
A.J.C. Derby and St. Leger, and he
failed in the Sydney Cup. The luck
came when he was a five-year-old ; in
that year he won the Melbourne Cup
with 9st. 31b. and the Australian Cup
with 9st. 131 b., the greatest weight ever
carried to victory in that race.

M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Exhibiting a profound contempt for
Marquis of Queensberry rules, Claude
Varner swung wildly at Joe Hall during
the greater part of their 15-rounder at
Sydney Stadium, and missed most of the
time. Some of the punches he landed
were illegal, and he was cautioned for
butting. Hall meanwhile scored with
crisp punches, but the lad did a lot of
holding and running. An uproar greeted
the decision for Varner.
* * * *
It is rare for the winner of a boxing
contest to be carried from the hall to a
hospital, but it happened to Lett Shep-
herd in Brisbane on Wednesday night
after he had outboxed Jim Richardson, a
Victorian middleweight ; and the poor
chap died on Sunday morning. He had
bled for several rounds from a wouqd
near the left eye, but the post-mortem
suggests heart disease as the cause of
death. Shepherd was a North Sydney
League footballer, and only 22.
Ins and Outs
“Aigburth”; It was casually men-
tioned at the Board of Control meeting
in Sydney that Nottingham had apolo-
gised to the Australians, through the
M.C.C., for Voce’s bowling against
Woodfull’s men. When the news reached
the lacemakers there was the dickens to
pay. A general meeting of the club has
been called, and the committee may be
asked to resign. It is asserted that no one
in Notts outside the committee had any
notion that the apology business was
afoot. This seems rather thin in view of
the fact that at the beginning of the season
Notts apologised to other counties which
had objected to the prize-ring methods
—to quote “Plum” Warner —of Larwood
and Voce. The letters of apology were
read at meetings and published in the
press. Lancashire, which declined to
play Notts this season, has accepted the
amende, though the fixture cannot be
resumed this year.
* * * *
“Old Q.”: Andrews fulfilled a long-
deferred promise when he scored his 253
against Ma at Sydney Cricket Ground
in such telling style. Andrews first made
his name at Maitland, and after being
brought to Sydney was chosen to play
against Queensland in Brisbane. He had
a job in one of the banks, and when his
employers refused to give him leave for
the trip he unwisely dropped it to take
up the glorious career of a cricketer.
Form deserted him, -N.S.W. dispensed
with his services and Le found anchor-
age in Queensland, wh'er* he is assistant
coach to the Q.C.A. This is his second
century in Sheffield ericktt, the other
being 110 for Queensland against Vic-
toria some three years ago. He is a
splendid fieldsman, and this score should
restore his confidence. If he maintains
his recovered form, he may be considered
as a Queensland representative in the
team for South Africa.
* * * *
“Dun”: There seems to be a slight
coolness between Woodfull and the
Board of Control. While manager
Bushby (not now a member) was invited
to attend the Sydney meeting and speak
his piece the captain was not, being
merely told he could send in a written
report if he felt like it. Bill evidently
didn’t, for no report came to hand. It
would be interesting to know if the board
has yet paid Woodfull’s expenses as a
selector, incurred before the tour. The
money was still unpaid when the Aus-
tralians came back from England, and
Woodfull again put in his bill. Possibly
this has induced the board’s aloof
attitude.
* * * *
“Hotham”: It has long been evident
that the googly craze has contributed to
the deterioration of Australian bowling.
The success of an outstanding exception
like Grimmett has misled hosts of imita-
tors ; bowlers of the type of Turner and
Trumble are now unknown, because
young aspirants to first-class cricket have
gone chasing false gods. Even the ex-
presses, fairly plentiful a few years ago,
have ceased to appear, though in McCor-
mick, of Victoria, something remotely re-
sembling one is promising better things.
The craze has ruined not only the bowl-
ing standard but the batting also. With
two or three exceptions the batsman able
to play any type of bowling with equal
facility is one with Nineveh and Tyre.
* * * *
“Chitor”: Australia has yet to see a
team of Indian cricketers, though indi-
vidual samples have been satisfactory.
The Rajputana C.C. has written asking
if Australians will entertain a team from
its ranks for a three months’ tour in 1935-
36. Particulars as to quality of the
players are to be supplied to the Board
of Control, which will consider the
matter if the Indian board approves.
Rajputana is the home of the finest of
Indian races, notable in war and sport
—witness “Ranji,” Duleep and Pataudi.
* * * *
“Cottesloe”: Westralia is not pleased
with the arrangement whereby it is to
pay all costs of the N.S.W. visit at the
end of the season. More reasonable
terms are being sought, for W.A. cricket
is far from financially bloated. At the
best, “gates” are small, and to pay for
the transport of a team from Sydney out
of the takings of this tour would be a
punishing proposition. The West has
done a lot for the game in putting down
wickets in outside centres and coaching
young players, and deserves every leg-up
the Eastern States can give it.
* * * *
These girl cricketers are real amateurs.
The five Victorians chosen for the match
in Brisbane travelled in second-class car-
riages—no sleeping-berths —had to pay
for their own board and lodging while
away, and buy the uniforms they wore on
the field. How the tennis amateurs must
laugh!

The Japanese swimmers appeared in
two State championship races at Sydney
Domain baths. The 110 yards back-
stroke was easy for Kiyokawa, who beat
Clark, Besomo and two others in lmin.
10 3-5sec., cutting 1 3-5sec. off Clark’s
Australian record. In the 220 yards free-
style Sakagami led for 150 yards and then
began, to drop back ; Noel Ryan beat
Hodgson by seven yards, with Sakagami
third. The time, 2min. 20 3-5sec., was
4-5sec. better than Ryan’s own State
record. Not till then was it announced
that the Japanese had influenza and had
only swum “to keep faith with the
public.” The association should have
known better than to let the plucky
fellow do it.

“Sorrento”: The centenary race across
the Tasman between the M.L. yachts Te
Rapunga and Ngataki was won by the
former, which was 19 days out of Auck-
land before casting up in Port Phillip.
Both boats encountered heavy weather;
Te Rapunga had to run into Russell and
Ngataki had to heave to. Te Rapunga
takes the Tasman Cup, worth £30, and
£70 in cash, while £20 goes to Ngataki,
which was 16 hours behind her rival
after deducting a time allowance. A
shorter race across Bass Strait was won
by that stout veteran Oimara, owned by
F. J. Bennell —her second win. She had
a southerly to shove her along, and took
31 hours from Devonport.

Under the Whip
Cueesun, favorite for the Perth Cup
practically from the publication of the
weights, had an easy victory—his second
in this race —from Dilemma, a horse
well known in Sydney, and Game Pie,
with old Second Wind fourth. Cueesun
is owned by W. P. Oliver and was ridden
by Dodd; he went out at 3 to 1,
Dilemma at 14 to 1, Game Pie at 66 to
1, and the time for the two miles was
3min. 28sec.
There is nothing left for Cueesun to
win in W.A., and presumably he will
now be sent east in quest of one or
more of the long-distance handicaps.
Stayers from Westralia that have dis-
tinguished themselves on this side of the
continent have been Blue Spec (Mel-
bourne Cup, 1905), Lily veil (Sydney Cup,
1914), lan ’Or (Sydney Cup, 1919), New
Tipperary (Australian Cup, 1919), Mac-
adam (Australian Cup, 1920), Eurythmic
(Caulfield Cup, 1920, and Sydney Cup,
1921), Lilypond (Sydney Cup, 1925) and
The Dimmer (Sydney Cup, 1931). Cuee-
sun is a five-year-old bay gelding by Aus-
tralian Sun, a noted sire of stayers, out
of Cue. Perth critics are agreed that he
is a much better horse than when he won
his first Perth Cup, and that there is no-
thing in the West in the same class with
him over a distance.
* * * *
Although Brown Force failed to im-
prove on his close second to Dark Chief
in the Summer Cup, failed even to get
a place, another Queensland-bred horse
won Tattersall’s Club Cup at Randwick
on New Year’s Day. He was the out-
sider of the field of nine, J. J. Leahy’s
Balgay, by Bachelor’s Persse—Coolan
Dhu. He had run poorly in a race on
the first day, and bookmakers called 100
to 3 ; but his rider, a clever youngster
named Murphy, caught the others nap-
ping, taking advantage of their desire
for a slow pace to set up a substantial
lead. Apart from Balgay, there was
not a real stayer in the race, and the
others grew tired chasing him. High
Cross (8 to 1) was the only one who
tackled him in the straight. But Balgay
had a bit in reserve, and beat High Cross
by half a head ; Dark Chief (6 to 1)
accounted for the others.
Balgay is a half-brother to Lilypond
and to Tangible, who went pretty close
to bringing another Sydney Cup into the
family—he was second to Winalot in
1928. Prior to Wednesday Balgay’s
record had not been distinguished, but
he has now more than earned his oats.
* * * *
Before the Q.T.C. three-day meeting
at Eagle Farm, Exaltation, a five-year-old
stallion by Highfield—lnclination, was
for sale for 300 guineas “and contin-
gencies.” He won the Goodwood
Handicap, seven furlongs, in Imin. 25sec.,
and the Shorts, six furlongs, in Imin.
12sec.; then Freedman, the owner, let
him go at 300 guineas. On those per-
formances he was worth two or three
times as much, but Freedman very sport-
ingly said he had named his price and
given his word, so the horse changed
hands and may go to Melbourne. Rivalli
(Rivoli —No. 4) brought a lot of coin
into the Tanwan family by winning three
races at the meeting, the Midsummer,
Newmarket and January handicaps.
With Bst. 111 b. in the Newmarket Handi-
cap he traversed a mile and a half in
2min. 31 sec. —3isec. faster than Balgay’s
time at Randwick ; with 9st. slb. in the
January Handicap, he galloped a mile
and a quarter in 2min. He must
now be accounted the best horse in
Queensland.
Ins and Outs
South Aus. had to bat on a wet wicket
against Victoria in Melbourne, and in 52
minutes’ play on the first day lost 3 for
34. Badcock (48) and Shepherd (80) did
better, but the side was all out for 264
(McCormick 4-82). Grimmett was un-
able to bowl and, thanks chiefly to Dar-
ling (159) and Bromley (59), Victoria made
416 (Wall 4-132, Lee 3-123). In S.A.’s
second shot Lonergan (64) and Nitschke
(48) took the score to three for 175, but
the total was only 234 (Fleetwood-Smith
4-96). Rigg and Darling knocked up the
required 83 in 37 minutes, giving Vic-
toria 15 points for its three matches.
Charlie Andrews (253), once a Ma
Stater, and Bensted (155) were the
heroes of the match in Sydney; they
helped Queensland out of a hole with a
seventh-wicket partnership only nine runs
short of the 344 world’s record put
up by Ranjitsinhji and Newham in
1902. N.S.W., batting first, knocked up
318 (Chipperfield 119 ; Wyeth and Oxen-
ham four wickets each), and with six
Queenslanders dismissed for 113 looked
like pulling it off. The next wicket, Ben-
sted’s, went at 448, and the last at 494.
Without O’Reilly the N.S.W. bowlers are
a poor lot; Quivers got three —after the
damage had been done. Rain stopped
the match at 4-286 (Fingleton 108) in
Ma’s second innings. Queensland on
the first innings.
N.S.W. is second on the Sheffield table
to Vic. with 11 points for four matches ;
“I’ll have to give up this game, Hori.”
“Py korri, mister, don’t give up yet. My brother waiting at te gully for lost
balls.”
Queensland has eight points for the same
number played, and S.A., played five, has
five points.

The Board of Control settled details of
the cricket tour of South Africa at its
meeting in Sydney. There will be 14
players, and each will get £3O0 —which
should satisfy even amateurs for a four
months’ absence, with the Afrikanders
paying all expenses. Victor Richardson
takes Bradman’s place on the selection
committee. Fifteen matches will be
played, including five Tests. The team
sails in October, and will have its first
game at Durban against Natal, beginning
November 23.
* * * *
The Board of Control has handed out
another £5200 to the States, balance of
profit on the 1934 tour of England
(£20,800 had already been paid out)
after deducting a small amount for board
expenses. Of the £26,000 total, Ma, Vic-
toria and South Australia got £6OOO each.
Queensland’s share was £4OOO, while
Tassie and Westralia banked £2OOO
apiece.

“Five Ways”; The best all-round
cricketer to figure in Australia (B.
2/1/’34)? George Giffen. I will take
that back when someone produces per-
formances to beat these —all against Vic-
toria: 17 wickets for 201 and 20-82 with
the bat; 14 for 125 and 106 ; 13 for 159
and 135 and 19 ; 16 for 166 and 237 ;
again 16 for 166 and 271. There were
many other performances almost as good
and in the best of company.
* * * *
South Australia’s quartet of centuries
against Queensland and Victoria’s four
against N. S. Wales have only once been
beaten in this country—in 1901, when
Syd Gregory, Noble, Duff, Poidevin and
Iredale piled up three figures each
against S.A. in Sydney.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Shirley”: Sarazen encountered a
tough opponent in Maoriland in A. J.
Shaw. They met at Rotorua, and after
a game in which there was never more
than a margin of one between them the
verdict was all square.
* * * *
“Black North”: The men of Ulster
are proverbially a hard lot, and those of
Belfast rank as the hardest. For years
the Belfast Golf Club has refused to per-
mit female members to enter the club-
house by the front door —there is a side
entrance for them, as there is in many of
the English cricket grounds for profes-
sionals. The associates, of course, have
tried every trick in the bag to break
down the ban, and recently wangled a
club plebiscite. This time they almost
got a foot into the half-opened door of

“Sandringham”: The Australian
women’s golf championship will be
played in Melbourne this year. Adelaide
was next on the roster, but the Crow-
eaters want the event for their centenary
in 1936 and have arranged a swap. The
fuss will begin early in September, and
the star turn will be a team of English-
women: five of these, with a manager-
captain, are to strike Perth about August
13. Royal Melbourne is to be the con-
vincing ground, and the visitors are to
leave for M.L. by the end of September.
After a month there they sail for home
via Panama. No news of the personnel
is to hand as yet.
Racquet and Bawl
“Centre Court”: Australia’s visitor
Wallis Myers, one of the greatest of the
tennis critics, has been making interest-
ing comparisons between past and present
champions—always a matter for contro-
versy in any sport. With over 30 years
of watching the tin gods of the game in
Europe and America, Wallis can be lis-
tened to with respect. He classes Tilden
as out by himself of the men he has
actually seen in action, with H. L.
Doherty, Brookes, Johnston and Lacoste
following in that order. Wallis thinks
that, while there are now many more
first-class players at the top, they are not
so solidly consistent as the old-timers.

“Samurai”: Japan has already sorted
out it's Davis Cup team. The first three
are Yamagishi, Hideo Nishimura and Jito
Fujikura, all representatives in last year’s
Cup team. The fourth man may be
Shinriyoku Hamashi, a student at the
Imperial University, who is regarded as
another Satoh.
* * * *
“Top Spin”: Now that an Australian
challenge for the next Davis Cup can be
taken as delivered —we have until the end
of January to chuck the castor into the
ring—the Cup dates may be worth pasting
in the old hat. The first, second and
third rounds of the European zone must
finish by May 19, June 11 and June 20
respectively. The final is down for July
15, the inter-zone final for July 20 and
following days. July 27, 29 and 30 will
see the challenge round at Wimbledon.
Egypt and South Africa want the Aus-
tralians, but are not likely to get them
as matters stand at present.
Miscellaneous
“G.M.”: If Jardine had been taken to
the upper room of Melb. Athenaeum when
I yvas there he would have imagined that
he had been carried to heaven. There
were 30 or 40 games going on, and you
could hear a pin drop. The voice of the
barracker was non-existent; any on-
looker who wished to comment on the
game nudged his friend, and they ad-
journed to the passage to argue. Every
now and then a tram passed, and spec-
tators looked up with worried faces, won-
dering if there was not some way to
prevent trams running at such sacred
moments. The chess championship
was on. Each pair of competitors
sat at a table, with a two-faced clock
in front; each man is compelled by the
laws governing championships to make
36 moves in the first two hours of play,
and 18 moves per hour thereafter. The
clock times each man and shuts off when
he has made his move. A thrilling spec-
tacle, but it lacks the dramatic incidents
of an egg-laying competition.

“Crawley”: Jean Taris, now in Aus-
tralia, holds the 300, 400, 500 and 1000
metres world’s records, and at the last
French championships won all the free-
style events. He protests that he is no
sprinter ; all the same, his time for the
100 metres is 59 4-ssec.

BUSINESS, ROBBERY, ETC.
Stuart Doyle Companies
Since the formation of the General
Film Co. in 1912, and of Union Theatres
and Australasian Films in 1913, share-
holders in Wests, Spencers, Amalgamated
Pictures and Greater J. D. Williams have
trusted the judgment of their directors to
a greater extent than the majority of
shareholders in public cos. Except on
special occasions—such as when U.T.
was contemplating liquidation—they have
learned few facts about the progress of
their investments. But great must have
been their astonishment when it appeared
that the ramifications of the combine
were a bit too obscure even for some
directors of holding cos.
When things were booming the “indus-
try” thrived on a policy of ballyhoo. Even
in 1920 there were “super-pictures” and
“gigantic theatres” in Sydney—in the
imagination of Mr. Stuart F. Doyle’s
blurb writers. Mr. Doyle is managing-
director of Greater Union Theatres, Ltd.;
he evidently came into the combine
via the Greater J. D. Williams Co., of
which he became a director in 1919. He
joined the board of
Spencers in 1927, of
Wests in 1930 and of
Amalgamated the same
year.
Under fair-weather
conditions the combine
was prosperous. Then
about 1928 an orgy of
picture-palace - building
took place. Mr. Doyle
has excused /umself by
saying that the group
was forced into it by
pressure from Ameri-
can distributors, who
threatened to build on
their own account.
In July, 1928, Union
Theatres asked for and
got from its share-
holding cos. £400,000
of new capital. In April, 1929, it
got another bagful—£3oo,ooo. There
was no mention of the American “threat”
while these negotiations were in progress.
Nor was it brought up when the outside
public in 1926 took up 350,000 8 p.c.
(guaranteed) prefs. in Union Theatres In-
vestments to build the State Theatre in
Sydney, nor in 1929 when Union Theatres
(Vic.) collected £250,000 of 8 p.c.
(guaranteed) pref. money to erect the
Melbourne equivalent of the Sydney
edifice.
From 1913 to 1928 the combined capi-
tals of Union Theatres and Australasian
Films were £600,000. In 1930 the
share registers of these two cos. and
the pref. money in the concerns run-
ning the State Theatres in Sydney and
Melbourne totalled £1,900,000. The
freehold of the Sydney State cost
£273,500, and it was estimated in the
prospectus that the theatre building and
shopping-block would run into £397,000.
After the aerial beacon, the “royal mez-
zanine lounge,” the “college room” and
a few other innovations inspired by Mr.
Stuart Doyle’s visit to the land of Rudy
Vallee and Clara Bow had been incor-
porated in the scheme, the bill came to
£731,000 or thereabouts.
Union Theatres, Ltd., overloaded with
extravagant building investments, got
into difficulties soon after slump came
along. The £700,000 of new capital
raised by U.T. was only one indication
of Mr. Doyle’s policy of “expansion” ;
the two cos. owed various people
£824,864 on Dec. 27, 1930, an increase
of £361,349 in four years.
In October, 1931, the E., S. and A.
Bank appointed a receiver over the assets
of U.T., and liquidation of the co. and
Australasian Films followed. With these
two cos. went the guarantee on the prefs.
in U.T. Investments and U.T. (Vic.); the
unfortunate holders of these both suf-
fered cuts in their div. rates as well. Out
of the ashes of the old cos. rose Greater
Union Theatres, Ltd. (which has a half-
interest in General Theatres Corp., man-
ager of its city theatres), and Australasian
Films (Holdings), Ltd. The latter co.
controlled British Empire Films, Cine-
sound Productions and General Theatres
Supplies. There are also other offshoots
—pups of pups—which appear to extend
to the third and fourth generations.
It is now proposed to issue 1,118,100
new shares in Australasian Films (Hold-
ings), Ltd., to the four public cos., and —
send for a wet towel! —the name of this
show is being changed to Greater Union
(Holdings), Ltd. Greater Union Theatres
is to write up its shares in other cos. by
£443,800 and goodwill and leases by
£579,200, and to issue £1,023,000 in
“A re you marrying Rachel for my
money?"
“Oh, no, sir”
“Then oud you ged! I vant no fools in
my family!”
bonus scrip to Greater Union (Holdings),
Cinesound Productions is to write up
goodwill by £70,000 and issue that much
scrip to G.U, (Holdings); British Empire
Films to water similarly by £25,000.
Starkey and Starkey, auditors to
Greater J.D.W., at the Dec., 1933,
balance accepted “no responsibility for
the amount at which the asset ‘shares in
Greater U.T., Australasian Films (Hold-
ings), U.T. (in liq.), Australasian Films
(in liq.)’ appears in the balance sheet.”
The directors of Spencers have ex-
pressed the hope that an aggregate
balance sheet of the operating cos. would
be issued to shareholders! J, E. Garvan,
a director of Wests, has written to “S. M.
Herald” suggesting that the directors of
Greater U.T. should “give us an oppor-
tunity at a further meeting to discuss the
proposals”! Spencers and Wests are two
of the cos. which “control” Greater U.T.
and Australasian Films. One begins to
wonder what control they have over Mr,
Stuart Doyle.
Shareholders in the four holding
cos. are plainly due for an explanation
of the whole extraordinary system of
interlocking companies and their control.
Mr, Garvan points out that the present
proposals, if carried into effect, “will take
away the control —indirect as it is —by
shareholders of the four holding cos. of
Greater U.T.” The investor’s control
over his investment through any one of
the four holding cos. seems remote
indeed.
The reason for the writing-up is in any
case obscure; shareholders have been
doing a perish for five years. It is blandly
explained that the revaluation figures are
“based on the original cost.” The whole
situation calls for investigation by a
shareholders’ committee, and for the
speedy passage of the N. S. Wales Com-
panies Bill, with clauses designed to pro-
tect investors in interlocking cos. and to
make it unhealthy for persons to raise
money for enterprises under pressure of
“threats” without disclosing the “threats”
in their prospectuses.
“Coo-ee,” Not “Coogee”
From T. H. Henderson, superintendent
and secretary of the Eastern Suburbs
District Ambulance Service:
In the article “Stevens on ‘Art Unions’ ”
(B. 26/12/’34) there wars a reference to a
Coogee carnival in which collections were
£21,903 and expenditure £22,611. Evidently you
have been misinformed in this connection. The
carnival referred to was never conducted at
Coogee. You probably meant to quote the
“Coo-ee” Carnival, which was run some time
ago, either at the Sports- or Showground.
1 have been directed by the committee of the
Eastern Suburbs District Ambulance Service to
ask you to publish a correction. The only
carnivals conducted at Coogee for a number of
years past have been run by the Ambulance
without the aid of a professional promoter, and
the law has always been complied with in regard
to the amount of profit. Our annual carnival
is open at the present lime, and people have
asked me for an explanation of your quotation.
It is felt that without a correction the finances
of the present carnival will be seriously im-
paired.
The statement objected to was made
by Col. Sec. Chaffey, whom “Hansard”
(pages 4692-3) reports as follows:
A carnival was held at Coogee, and the
receipts were actually less than the expendi-
ture. The receipts were £21,903 and the
expenditure £22,611, or a loss of £7OB.
This was a carnival supposed to be in aid
of Coo-ee City.
The Bulletin is glad to learn that
Coogee is blameless, and that the Ambu-
lance Service employs no professional
promoter and has always conformed to
legal requirements as to profits.

Last year 61 new no-liability mining
cos. were registered in N. S. Wales, an
increase of 140 p.c. compared with 1933.
Nominal capital was £2,303,475, an in-
crease of 321 p.c. The volume of all
cos. registered was the greatest since
1929; 737 were formed that year, as
against 715 in 1934.

The S’African-German wool agree-
ment has been signed. The Vaterland is
to take wool to a value not exceeding
£2,400,000 by May 30, 1935, while it is
expected that the Union will take Ger-
man goods to an equivalent value by
September 30 of this year.

“Jack-in-Office”: A friend —a cot case
—tried to land a car in Brisbane. In
England he had a special body built
to permit his wheeled chair being run
up a small ramp into the car. This was
an inexpensive job, yet the Customs offi-
cials demanded £l5O duty. After argu-
ment, they came down to £129. My
friend declined, and so the Customs re-
moved the body from the chassis (which
cost £l5, and is free of duty). He is
having a makeshift body run up in Bris-
bane, a job which, owing to the holi-
days, will not be completed until the
middle of January, and the Common-
wealth will waste a few more pounds in
destroying its useless trophy.

M. Rollin, France’s Colonial Minister,
has a Five-Year Plan to make the
French Empire “economically indepen-
dent.” France before the war bought 5
p.c. of its raw materials from its posses-
sions. Now it takes 23 p.c., as against
Britain’s “in-the-family” purchases of
37 p.c. Rollin’s plan is to extend France’s
policy by substituting wool from its
northern African possessions for Austra-
lian, Indo-Chinese coal for Welsh, and
so on.

“El V.”: The new “Monthly Trade
Bulletin” of the Commonwealth Depart-
ment of Commerce should bring tourists
flocking to see our wonders even if it
does not find us any trade. Some of the
wonders are illustrated on the front page.
One is a 16ft.-high nigger (in a rami )
gazing across a river bend at a palm-
treed village. Another is a wool waggon.
This is drawn by eight dairy steers and
calves, one of which has only two legs.
They are unyoked, and appear to be
attached to the wain (except the leaders,
which aren’t attached at all) by intermit-
tent bits of string. Their driver, with a
whip yards long, is sitting on the box
as if he were tooling Ye Olde Brighton
Coach. And behind him, on the light
four-wheeled wool-waggon, are 45 bales,
each so big that it must weigh at least
a ton. It is easy to see that a Country-
party Minister is supervising the Com-
merce Department.

U.S.A. crop returns make it look as
if Nature had decided to teach Roose-
velt a point or two about restriction. The
maize output will be the smallest since
1881 ; pastures are the poorest on record.
Oats, barley and sorghums are 34 p.c.
below last year’s returns and 46 p.c.
below normal average. The hay crop is
33 p.c. light, and wheat—estimated at
493,000,000 bushels —will be shorter in
supply than since 1893. And the drought
isn’t over yet.

A WOMANIS
LETTER
Quite the nicest thing at the races the
other day was to see Colin Stephen and
Harry Budge being congratulated on
their knighthoods by troops of friends.
Sadie and Elise Budge were with father.
Both wore blue, though Sadie introduced
a softly pink hat into her color scheme.
Summer frocks and shady hats were the
sensible wear of the many, Mrs. Pat
Osborne looking both smart and efficient
in a mixture of navy and sand color.
One of the pretty ones was Mrs, Ellis
Fielding Jones, all soft greys splashed
with pink. The Knox lady was there,
and Mrs. Peter Poole in an enviable
white hat. Mrs. R. A. Eakin was another
of the white-and-wide-hatted.
With neither grasshoppers nor Scout
jamborees to keep her on the jump and
all her butterflies flittering at Palm Beach
and Newport or going dryad-ish in bosky
dells among the mountains, Sydney is
drowsing through the sudden onset of
summer heat. The only active spot is the
Opera House, where Brunnhilde, unde-
terred by atmospherics, waves her battle
spear, and the Valkyries triumphantly ride
the storm.
It wasn’t exactly a surprise when Irene
Anderson and polo player Jim Ashton
announced their engagement, and now
that two of the persistent bachelor
brothers have gone diamond-buying the
others may do likewise, Geoff started the
business with his engagement to pretty
Janet Thatcher ; now Jim has plucked off
another of the city’s belles. The Anderson
girls are good-lookers, inheriting quite
a bit in this direction from their mother,
Mrs. Willie Anderson, who is a sister of
the Sam Hordern lady. Cousin Audrey
Hordern, it will be remembered, first
wedded polo to the clan when she be-
came Mrs. Bill Winter Irving. Over-
thorpe, the W. A. Anderson Double Bay
home, housed a cocktail party, all re-
lations and intimates, to celebrate.
The vice-regal Games are in the throes
of farewells. Midway through last week,
just as the daily storm was getting into
action, Lady Game arrived at the
Women’s Country Club to drink her last
cup of tea with its members. Flower
compositions of blue hydrangea and
orange-lily made the corners of the long
room gay, but every inch of its floor
space was solidly or slimly woman.
There had never been a more successful
party, numerically or musically. The
latter isn’t to be wondered at, since the
arranging of the programme was in the
hands of Mrs. Stephen Herford.
In the vice-reine’s straw hat the light
and dark browns of the wallflower were
woven, and her frock was a simple cool
effect of white silk patterned closely in
brown. President Mrs. George Irvine
and deputy Mrs. Stanley Wilson received
the honored guest, on whom a sheaf of
gladioli and delphiniums was thrust.
There was a flowerful gleaning also for
Mrs, Mowll, who arrived accompanied
by her tall Archbishop.
Spats and the rolled-umbrella habit
seem to be the best tip for the New Year
after scanning the Weather Bureau
records. During 1934 rain fell on 183
days, and that has not been equalled since
1893. On 78 days there were thunder-
storms of the violent class, and 64.91
inches of rain fell. And yet, with a faith
that is touching though unjustified, we
still call ours a fine climate, and go gaily
forth minus coat or brolly on any morn
that the sun shines. One ancient ferry
traveller puts all the weather upset down
to the wireless. Maybe. But what did
they blame in 1893? Bicycles, probably.
The first bride to ask the blessing of
the new R.C. church at Maroubra on
her matrimonial venture was Laura
Helen Trussell. She had come from
Cootamundra to marry Captain Patrick
Sarsfield McGrath, and was not to
be deterred because the church was
not yet out of the hands of the builders.
The bride was dressed in an ice-blue
ensemble and attended by two ’maids.
Her Patrick was best-manned by D. A.
McGrath. The honeymoon rose above
one of the New Year’s Pacific Island
cruises. The future home will be at
Tamworth, where the bridegroom is
stationed as adjutant of the new 33-41st
Battalion.
The really hearty eater has to start
his dinner early on a Wagner night. By
seven o’clock cfowds were streaming into
the Tivoli vestibule, and by seven-thirty
the theatre was packed from stall to top-
most circle. Only the merest handful
were late enough to have the way barred
by closed doors and stern attendants at
7.45, when the orchestra got into action.
The house was well dressed, but raiment
was of the diaphanous chiffon variety.
There were more
fans than coronets —
it was that sort of
night—and the lucky
owners waved them
as vigorously as the
conductor did his
baton or Brunnhilde
her battle-axe. Cul-
ture isn’t so very
cooling, and in the
intervals everybody
dashed out and
stood about gasping
like newly-landed
fish or gobbling ice-
creams.
Ben Fuller’s lady
wore glittering lame
in gold and cherry-
pink. With her were
daughter Mrs. A.
Rainbow, and Mrs.
W. Douglas, very
fair, in rose satins.
Slapoffski was there,
remembering that it
was under his baton
“The Valkyrie” had
been presented to
Sydney in 1900.
Then, also, it was
done in English.
Singer Carrie Lance-
ley, in her cinnamon
laces, was a hand-
some interlude in the
front row of the
circle. Where the
vice-regals would
have been if they
hadn’t been at son Philip’s party sat the
broadcasting Clearys, the Chief Justice
Jordans, she in flowered silks, and Mrs.
Spencer Brunton. Morgan O’Neill brought
his Kathleen; Lute Drummond trailed
magnolia satins, and kept a keen glance
on her two Valkyrie trainees, Alice Prowse
and Joan Hammond. Mrs. de Abravanel
and the Ben Williamses were among the
applauders, as was Alice Danciger, all
black and pink and silver chiffons, of the
last scene, when all was disaster and curl-
ing yellow flame dominated by the Tyrian
purple of the cloaks of the ill-fated
Brunnhilde and the triumphant Wotan.
A group of young Philip Game’s
friends gave him an opera party by way
of farewell, and last Thursday night he
retailiated by giving a music party as
his good-by-e-e. This was in Government
House, and the piano in the drawing-
room was the storm centre. But if you
wanted to be cool and sylvan, there were
chairs on the verandahs beyond the
room’s glass doors. Trees and lawns and
fountains were goldenly floodlit, and in-
doors Betty Higgins, in dryad-greer
taffetas, raised her voice in song, and
Athos Martelli and Alexander Sverjen-
sky expressed themselves through ’cello
and piano. Sir Philip and Lady Game
were rather late comers, having first been
to a meeting of the Adult Deaf and
Dumb Society. Lady Game’s frock was
of silver satin, and she carried deep-red
flowers.
English visitor Lady Hambro, Jean
Cheriton and Mrs. Walter Swinson were
among the listeners. Debs, and sub-debs,
were thick on the horizon, lots of them,
like Helen Hughes, Ellis and Denise Dett-
mann and Mollie Walder, having rushed
up from Palm Beach and Newport for
the night. Janet Thatcher, her petal-pink
chiffons cascading in frills, was one of
the attractive. Gwen Stevens, another
pink bud, Valerie Bavin and Joan Crow-
hurst, Margaret Burns and Elise, Sadie
and little Rosemary Budge were among
the crowd of under- and just-beginning-
twenties who said good-bye to their friend,
who sails with his parents on the 15th.
Mollie Walder will be one of the six
pretty maidens in billows of white
organdie sashed in green who will sell you
cigarettes at the Government House
garden party. Mollie is the daughter of
knight (and alderman) Sam Walder, and
until the Christmas holidays was a
schoolgirl. Her ambition is to act well.
Her chief summer joy is surfing.
Padre S. G. Drummond and his wife
were all smiles on Saturday when friends
of the Far West Kiddies’ Home at
Manly gathered round to see Premier
Stevens unveil a bronze tablet erected in
recognition of the kindly offices of Sir
Philip and Lady Game. This scheme for
bringing the youngster of the outback
down to the Sydney beaches to hear what
the wild waves are saying, to have baby
teeth and tonsils plumbed and surveyed
and to receive gifts from a Christmas-
tree in the Manly schoolground has
always been heartily cheered by the vice-
regals. And the movement has other
good friends, Mrs. Corfield, of Dee Why,
among them. That lady had a birthday
last week, and, instead of choosing a
diamond ring or a luxurious fur for her-
self, she and her husband donated prop-
erty worth nearly £lOOO to the Far West
holiday movement.
Mrs. Vernon Coles, one of the city’s
best-known clubwomen, went off by the
Oronsay last Saturday for 12 months.
Eighty of her friends came up from
Manly, down from Wahroonga and the
Mountains and places in between to say
good-bye to her at the Women’s Club.
The party would have been a hundred
strong if it hadn’t been for the weather,
which was a fair imitation of the Deluge.
Mrs. Coles’s chrysanthemum-brown lace
frock was handsome and trained, and
was worn with a brown velvet hat whose
brim was upsweeping. Professional,
writing and artistic women made up the
animated groups over which masses of
blue and palely-flushed hydrangea and
crimson roses breathed their perfume.
Freddie and Freda, the popular chim-
panzees from Taronga Park, are already
looking out festive attire for the garden
party at Government House on Friday.
This is to be Sydney’s farewell to Lady
Game, and it should go off splendidly if
not swamped out by the thunderstorm of
our daily expectation. Beauty has been
whistled from every bush and beach by
clever organiser Mrs. A. C. Godhard and
her sub-committees, and will sell the
visitor programmes, cigarettes or sweets
or pose as the immortals in Tennyson s
“Dream of Fair Women.” Florence
Austral, Muriel Brunskill and Browning
Mummery will weigh in with their talents
on the operatic side of the bill-of-fare,
while the Kellaways, Nellie Barnes and
others will give examples of classical,
national and tap dancing. In short, there
will be a continuous programme in
various parts of the ground from two
o’clock till six. The Bush and District
Nurses will be the profit-gleaners.
This Letter flings a laurel wreath
above the crow’s-nest of the Niagara. Of
all the ships that left our shores lately on
pleasure cruises she alone really looked
a joy ship. Cunningly leaving the Wharf
about the cocktail hour, she took a few
hours’ respite off Rose Bay. Here, as the
stars came up, she blazed into myriads
of constellations, and the red and black of
her funnels could be seen plainly from
the heights of Neutral Bay. Though sick-
ness might come with the morrow, those
on board dined and danced, walked and
talked on that first night without a care.
Returned travellers, incidentally, tell of
monstrous sharks positively sniffing at
the whaleboats in which the journey
from the Niagara to the shores of pine-
clad Lord Howe was made.
A Sydney girl who is climbing steadily
to stardom both on the screen and on
the London stage is Nancy, one of the
three daughters of Dr. S. A. Smith. One
of her best parts up to date was as the
leading youngster in “Vintage Wine.”
This was a Seymour Hicks production at
Daly’s, and the cast was headed by
Seymour himself; Julia Neilson and
Claire Luce were in it, so Nancy (she
calls herself Nancy O’Neill on the stage)
was in good company. The Smith
couple have just sold their home in
Victoria-road, Bellevue Hill, to the W.
Crossings, and Mrs. Smith and daughter
Lorraine are off to join Nancy and Bar-
bara in London.
To-night the Governor and Lady Game
hold one of their final at-homes in Syd-
ney. They evidently don’t hold with the
poet who sang
Parting is such sweet sorrow
That I shall say farewell till it be morrow.
The time of arrival is 8.45, while a note
on the back of the cards says “Cars
10.45 p.m.”
One of Sydney’s senior presswomen,
Fanny Marley, has been entertaining a
sister from the North. The visitor,
Mrs. Hadgraft, who lives near Brisbane,
though turned 70 has never been south
before.
Money is coming in briskly for Beryl
Morrin, a bright 13-year-old schoolgirl,
who was fearfully mauled by a shark in
the George’s River. Beryl is now in the
Canterbury Hospital, her face cheerfully
set towards recovery. The hero of the
tragedy was Jim Schofield, a young mar-
ried man who waded into the river and
rescued the little girl.

Melbourne
Chatter
The Town Hall steps, which during
the last few months have supported
quantities of spindle heels, toeless
sandals, dancing pumps and field boots
with shiny spurs, were trodden one
evening last week by 1000 pairs of
serviceable black brogues. Foyer and
main hall were filled with navy-blue and
turned-up Guide hats for the Guides’
welcome to Lady Baden-Powell. The
world Chief Guide, who drove up from
Frankston, was escorted to the stage by
the State Commissioner, General
Chauvel’s lady (who has been honored
with the order of the Silver Fish), the
State sec., Sybil Irving, and president
Margaret Anderson and secretary Alison
Brown, of the Guides’ Committee. Miss
Anderson presented Lady Baden-Powell
with a hand-woven lettercase containing
a parchment copy of the Welcome Song.
Guides’ neat fingers made the case, and
the blue linen pattern was woven by
Hatty Alexander. At the conclusion of
her speech Lady Baden-Powell took out
of her pocket the highly-prized Beaver,
which she presented to Sybil Irving, who
has thus become the only Guide Beaver
in Australia. As a conclusion every-
body joined in the “Bush Night Song”
and the “Kookaburra Round.”
Among a visitor’s first impressions of
the jamboree was the size of the camp —
300 acres of scrub and tea-tree through
whjich narrow tracks twist and turn
among the canvas sub-camps. A long
orange-drink at one of the stalls in the
shopping area was much appreciated after
a tramp, map in hand, up the Boome-
rang, along Coach-road, getting bushed
among Emu, Owl and Pineapple streets,
a search for the Lady Scouters’ Hostel
(a canvas tent guarded by two wooden
wolves) and a look at the display area
from the natural amphitheatre which,
runs round to the Ridge. At all hours
the Scout Shop ( Schout Winkel, Magasin
pour Scouts, and its equivalents in
Chinese, Tamil and Arabic) did a roar-
ing trade. There was a canvas creche
where women visitors could park their
offspring provided the infants had
neither “spots nor colds.” Each sub-
camp fenced its group of tents with
barbed wire; Hong Kong was directly
opposite the Ist Kew Division, which
built itself a high watchtower, and the
Ceylon erection was a Cingalese build-
ing of three-ply and canvas where
curios were for sale. Signboards pointed
the way to post offices and banks, and
on many street corners were letter boxes
shaped like life-size Scouts.
Girl Guides in their businesslike navy-
blue conversed with Scouts from India.
Lady Scouters in their dark-green uni-
forms (their job is to look after little
Wolf Cubs) exchanged ideas with the
American Scouts. French and Aus-
tralian boys experimented with each
other’s vocabularies. Belts were much
in barter, and there was hardly a hand-
kerchief, scarf or pocketknife which did
not change hands at least once.
The small sturdy lads from Nauru, in
their white shirts, scarlet lava-lavas and
scarves, were overwhelmed at such
crowds. Until they came to Australia
they had never seen a train, nor had they
eaten ice-cream. Every afternoon a pro-
gramme by different troops was per-
formed on the arena. On the South
Australian day the S.A. Governor, Sir
Winston Dugan, addressed his 'Scouts
and ordered them to give a “jolly good
laugh.” The effort was fair, for it’s hard
to laugh at nothing; but Sir Winston
called it only a giggle and told his lads
that he wanted a real laugh next time.
Their cheers, however, were long, lusty
and vigorous.
Three cheers were given for Sir Philip
Game, who, on his flying visit to Mel-
bourne specially to attend the jamboree,
was invested with the Silver Wolf, the
highest order of the Scout movement.
On the same day “8.-P.” visited the
Fijian camp, where he was presented
with a tabua (whale’s tooth), and the
Malay camp, which honored him with
a sumpitan, a long wooden blowpipe
used for shooting poisoned darts. An-
other of his gifts which may be useful
if he is ever short of matches is a
buffalo horn which, when used correctly,
will produce fire by means of suction.
At the Indian camp he was decorated
by a piece of cloth of gold being placed
round his head, a sign of friendship and
respect, and was presented by Raj
Kemar, a prince of the Dhen Kenal
State, with a bamboo leaf on which is
inscribed the words of an ancient prayer.
This highly-prized leaf had been in the
prince’s family for centuries. Among
other presents were a clay model of the
Marseer fish and a Damascus dagger
with an inlaid mother-of-pearl handle.
On Saturday, competitors in the tennis
championships had a look at the
squelchy swamp which the rain had.
made of the Kooyong courts and re-
turned home or to their hotels with
freshly-ironed togs undisturbed in their
suitcases. Most of them returned for
the dance in the evening feeling very
vigorous after an inactive day. The
house committee had arranged for a
marquee filled with twinkly lights, masses
of pot-plants and a forest of gum-sap-
lings to shelter the supper-tables, but a
furious gale and occasional heavy
showers of rain kept everyone at the
clubhouse. The verandahs were pro-
tected by canvas blinds, but the wind
found chinks to squeeze through and
jerk its cold fingers upon bare shoulders
and neatly-waved locks. Among the
guests were tennis players from England,
South Africa, Czecho-Slovakia, France,
Spain and most of the Australian States.
Dorothy Round managed her swaying
draperies as gracefully as she does her
racquet. Helen Sage, in mignonette-green,
with opalescent shoulder ornaments,
which between dances disappeared under
a little green jacket, and Mrs. R. M.
Robertson, in floral chiffon with a pre-
ponderance of black, gold and red, were
the reliable committee members respon-
sible for the arrangement of banks and
bowers of hydrangeas in the clubhouse
and the flag draperies and bobbing
Chinese lanterns which assisted the hang-
ing baskets of fern to camouflage walls
and roof of the verandahs.
During last week courts belonging to
many of Macedon’s most beautiful
homes were used by hordes of social
young things for a tennis tournament in
aid of the C.W.A. The weather broke
soon after the finals, when trophies were
presented to the successful competitors.
As a wind-up to the gay and social week
there was an invitation dance at the
C.W.A. hall, filled for the occasion with
gladioli, roses and lilies and a crackling
fire, for Victorian weather has no respect
for the month of January. Beryl Cowper,
in black tulle, and Betty Clarke, in two
shades of blue, were the joint secs, of
the occasion. Diana Landale wore
pastel-patterned moire, and Margaret
Syme’s henna garment had a glitter of
silver here and there. Cara Holmes-
Hunt was in slinky ivory satin. Among
other guests were Suzanne and Annette
Ruddiford, both in blue, Denise Raleigh
in a rustle of spring flowers, Peter Lem-
priere, Ken Kernot Ron Umphelby.
In the New Year batch of honors was
a knighthood for Brigadier-General
Jess, official organiser of the centenary
celebrations. Here is a Broothorn pic-
ture of his lady, whose chief interests are
centred in home, husband and three
children, Digger, John and Betty, who
are acquiring during the school holidays
a satisfactory coat of suntan on St.
Kilda beaches. When she went to Eng-
land during the war to be nearer her
husband, the packed troop-and-passenger
ship on which the Jess lady travelled
from America had just enough life in
it to limp into port, for it was tor-
pedoed in the Irish Sea. Brig.-General
Jess (who hails from Bendigo) has
made a study of costumes, particularly
naval and military uniforms, worn in
past centuries. He designs costumes
and settings for pageants, can draw and
paint, and has fashioned with a penknife
a miniature tableau of the Changing of
the Guard, groups out of history-books
and miniature figures from old pictures.
Peninsula Country Club started the
year with its usual merry dance. Every-
body managed to arrive in time for the
dinner, though it meant averaging 50
miles per hour on the Point Nepean-road.
The same people were thankful to nose
home at a mild 20 in the early hours of
the morning, for a dense fog hung in the
low-lying areas around the bay. Paper
caps were worn from dinner onwards ;
General Grimwade had one trimmed
with ox-blood frills. Colonel Walton,
who is in Lord Baden-Powell’s retinue,
was present with his wife, who
was clad in pink georgette. Dr. Eric
Gutteridge’s wife rustled brown-and-
white-check taffeta; the dress had
elaborately-winged sleeves and the cape
was frisky with pleated trimmings. The
Lindsay Fields, of Deniliquin, were there,
Mrs. Field wearing black matt crepe
patterned with deep-red and pale-gold
flowers. Win Thompson’s dress showed
a flower-garden patterning. Commander
Robinson brought his wife, whose sap-
phire velvet gown had twinkly shoulder-
ornaments. Tall Millicent Cairns carried
her fair head bound with a halo plait
above a water-green ninon gown, attached
to its shoulder-straps by unusual rings of
the same material. Mrs. Hilton-Wood
was in blue, with a rose-dust cape and
ornamental twist in her hair; her
husband wore a purple butcher’s cap
bristling with green and yellow tufts.
Win Marsden chose black and a glitter-
ing sequined coatee. Mrs. Fred Dennett’s
black ninon was sprayed with cherry-
colored patterning.
Diana Knox and Darren Baillieu are
a handsome pair who have recently
announced their engagement. The bride-
to-be, who is the only daughter of the
late Major W, J. Knox and Mrs. Knox,
of Camperdown, leads the social and
open-air life which is the lot of the lucky
young people who live in the Western
District. Her fiance is the elder son of
Arthur Baillieu, of Anderson-street,
South Yarra, and the late Mrs. Baillieu.
A Broothorn camera made the portrait
of Miss Knox.
The Railway Department celebrated
the birth of 1935 with the good resolu-
tion of a reduction in fares to Flemington
racecourse. Perfect summer weather
brought out scores of floral materials
for the New Year meeting. Lawn-
sweeping draperies were entirely absent;
dresses were a combination of utility and
elegance, the only eccentricity of dressing
being provided'by hats. The largest on
the course was like a great white sail.
Mrs. Cliff Scantlebury’s black coat had
three-quarter sleeves, and was elaborately
worked in panels of smocking. Mrs. Jack
Crawford, in navy-blue with a crisp white
bow at her throat, was one of the many
feminine punters who combated the glare
with sunglasses. One girl wore a genuine
school-child hat, inspired by the antique
seaside models with ribbon tails dangling
over turned-up-all-the-way-round brims.
Veteran Alec Isaacson had his inevitable
petunia buttonhole. Miss Goulston was
all in brown. The Grant Hays were there,
she in a black tailored suit. Mrs. Harry
Henty’s nose-veil was a-bobbing with
small white puff-balls, and Maisie Wat-
son’s apple-green dress had its quota of
accordion pleating round the hem. Rose-
mary Wright’s dove-grey frock had basque
hips, and was partially sheltered by a sun-
shade dashed with cherry. Mrs. Charles
Langley (Sydney) wore white and brown
pencil stripes, and Mrs. Rupert Downes
chose a large shady hat to accompany her
floral crepe gown.
It was a very warm night for Solveig
Due’s twenty-first birthday dance, but
the young things enjoyed themselves in
the pale-grey atmosphere of the
Embassy. Miss Due, who among her
friends sacrifices her Christian name,
about which is wrapped so many Norse
legends, for the nickname of Neenoo,
wore a gown of pale sapling-green
which flowed into a train from its cut-
on-the-cross foundation. Her mother,
Mrs. L. Due, was wrapped in a black
lace garment made with a sweeping train
and the new notion for a split up the
side.
The late-afternon party given at Men-
zies by Mrs. Norman Welch and Mrs.
Humphrey Clegg lured several carloads
of people back to town from mountain
eyries and from under gay beach um-
brellas. Mrs. Clive Fairbairn, in ice-blue
crinkle crepe traced with white and brick-
red twigs and wearing a large summery
hat, was guest of honor. Mrs. Welch was
in a flowered chiffon frock, at the throat
of which she had pinned a spray of lily.
of-the-valley, and Mrs. Clegg wore a
dark-blue hat with a white-and-blue-
patterned dress. Mrs. J. G. Shields in
black-and-white, Mrs. L. F. Mcßean in
patterned taffeta and Mrs, John Winter-
Irving in a cream-and-wine-red creation
were among the guests. Annette Powell,
who left this week for London under
Mrs. Fairbairn’s wing, wore a spotted
blouse with her lightweight tailored suit.
David Fairbairn, who intends going to
Cambridge, is also accompanying his
mother.
The only daughter of the A. C, Mac-
millans, of Metung, Gippsland, has given
her promise to the only son of Lennon
Raws and his lady. Gwen Macmillan is
tall and fair and fond of an open-air
life ; her parents both come of pastoral
families. Geoffrey Raws has chosen the
great open spaces for his career, and
hopes to have a property of his own
before the marriage-bells ring.
Mrs. Alfred Deakin, widow of the
Australian statesman, died at her home
at Point Lonsdale three days before her
decoration of C.B.E. was announced.
Mrs. Deakin was a woman of culture
and of high ideals. She was interested
in music, art and literature, and kept
herself informed in Australian politics.
When her husband was Prime Minister
she was of great assistance to him in his
official and social duties. On several
occasions she accompanied him over-
seas upon his missions of State. Mrs.
Deakin did splendid war work, and until
the time of death included returned
soldiers and their dependants among her
many philanthropic interests.
At the Princess F. W. Thring is run-
ning “Peter Pan” by day and “The
Cedar Tree” by night. It’s the “Peter
Pan” of the picture books, even to
Wendy’s calico nightie, with its old-
fashioned frills round neck and wrists,
and Peter’s children in brown stockings
and knickerbockers reaching half-way
across their kneecaps. The audiences of
children are delighted at Nana, the Dar-
ling family’s dog-nurse, and consider her
the real thing in English sheepdogs.
Phyllis Baker, in Peter’s regulation tights,
ragged-edged jacket and plumed cap,
saves the life of fairy Tinker Bell by get-
ting the audience to declare that it does
believe in fairies. Peter flies gracefully
and dexterously manages to turn round
on the narrow mantelpiece (whither he/
she is carried by an invisible cord) with-
out overbalancing. In the Never Never
Land there are trees with faces, and Our
Home Underground makes small boys
and girls long for a taste of adventure in
such a romantic setting.
Gladys Moncrieff is afraid neither
of ringlets nor of white tulle. Through-
out “The Cedar Tree” she wears cork-
screws, and on her way to the ball at
Windsor (owing to the self-sacrificing
plot of a pseudo-bushranger she never
arrives at the dance) her gown is a whirl
of white satin tulle. One of her riding
habits is of navy serge and the other
is voluminous sapphire velvet. Claude'
Flemming, as Roger Carstairs, must have
persuaded the wardrobe mistress to sew
on his buttons with sailor’s twine, so
severe is the strain round the middle of
his nineteenth-century buttoned-up coat.
There is a delightful dancing scene in the
Valley of the Cedar, where koala bears
tumble among the bracken and gum-
trees. Pat Eadie does her clever lyrebird
dance to a whistling off-stage, and the
parrot ballet pirouettes in costumes of
brilliantly colored feathers.

I am in doubt
concerning the
aesthetic purpose
of the latest Rus-
sian ballet, as
also of ballet-
dancing in general.
What particularly does it aim at, by
what criterion do audiences judge it, and
what is its purpose artistically?
It certainly tries to do more than the
Beautiful Eight at the various Tivolis.
They are simply glorified gymnastic
artists, and are intrinsically no more
graceful than a regiment of Prussian
soldiers doing the goosestep. True grace
comes unconsciously when people do
some job with the intention of doing that
job and no other. Thus the actions of
a traffic cop are frequently most grace-
ful. A good conductor directing an
orchestra and completely absorbed in the
problems of the musical score before
him can be graceful; so is a golf cham-
pion or a Bradman slogging or dodging
a Larwood. But there is no grace or
beauty in the conversion of these move-
ments into an elaborate convention.
Viewed objectively, it is supremely
idiotic. Nor is there any grace in the
more highbrow use of so-called classic
poses as dance motives.
Dancers like Maud Allen and Isadora
Duncan solemnly studied the Greek
statues and endeavored to reproduce
their crystallised actions in angular
movements of their bodies. But this
is not what the sculptors were interested
in. They contemplated the men and
women moving naturally about them,
and endeavored to give an impression of
their movements. That the result was
apparently a pose was due to the nature
of their medium. What they tried to
suggest was not a human being suffering
from a paralytic stroke but in process
of converting one position into another
in the course of performing some action.
Isadora apparently believed that Beet-
hoven, Bach, Brahms and other com-
posers were not satisfied with what they
had expressed by the arrangement of
musical sounds, so she hopped about in
a nightshirt under the delusion that she
was making their meaning clearer.
This cult, which arose in Berlin and
has recently died there, hit Australia a
few years ago, and the results were uni-
formly depressing. I witnessed one
exponent of this school interpret Beet-
hoven’s Fifth Symphony, and I gathered
from the display that what the composi-
tion was intended to convey was that a
young lady suffering alternately from
religious ecstasy and locomotor ataxia
eventually fainted.
Then there is the orthodox Russian
dramatic-cwm-gymnastic school, repre-
sented in modified form by the present
Russian company, and whose greatest
modern exemplar was Nijinsky, now
ending his days in a lunatic asylum in
Europe. Nijinsky was the greatest defier
of the laws of gravitation that the art
has ever produced. He had sinews as
hard as wire, muscles like steel springs,
a heart that was an inexhaustible pump,
and he could get from the front to the
back of the stage in a single bound. He
was the only dancer of modern times who
could perform the entre-chat dix —that is
to say, could clap his majestic thighs and
cross his magnificent legs ten times while
m mid-air; but he was not proud of this
accomplishment, though Pavlova once
fainted from jealousy and resentment be-
cause an audience gave him more cur-
tain calls for this achievement than it
hid for Anna’s more restrained genu-
flections.
What Nijinsky wished to do was to
make dancing a medium for his phil-
osophy of life and for his observations
°f the frailties of human nature. In
°ther words, he wished it to do the job
of the writer. He carried this desire so
tar that he placed his last ballet in a
Waison toleree, hoping to illustrate with
his impings and posturings both the
beauty and the destructive quality of
love ; but he only succeeded in appalling
his audience, who had come to be enter-
tained, not instructed. What he did not
understand was that dancing has its limi-
tations, just as have music and painting ;
only they happen to be greater. This
fact so preyed on his mind that later in
his career he relapsed into femininity.
Nature decided the problem for him by
sending him mad.
Personally, I am inclined to think that
the obvious purpose of the ballet is to
act as an aphrodisiac. This was what
the sculptor Rodin probably thought
when he rushed behind the scenes in
Paris on one occasion, embraced Nijin-
sky and subsequently took up the cudgels
in his defence in a public controversy.
Nijinsky’s dancing was so frankly sexual
that it caused riots in the theatre, even
in Paris. Grand duchesses hurried from
the scene, and gentlemen fought duels
over the matter. Nijinsky was obliged to
resign from the Mariinsky Theatre be-
cause his appearance without a slip
offended members of the royal family.
“Santiago, Old Malaga,” etching by Lionel Lindsay, purchased for the
National Gallery, Sydney.
Most of the innovators who have
attacked the conventions of the ballet
have, like Nijinsky, played startling varia-
tions on the theme of the erotic.
If this conception of the purpose of
the ballet be accepted the present com-
pany, with its charming, artificial, idyl-
lic, whimsical, witty performances, is
in the tradition, along with the Austra-
lian aboriginal, whose realistic divertisse-
ments have been described by Base-
dow and others. Even in his conversa-
tion, according to Basedow, the aborigi-
nal is so animated by the recollection
of his actual experience that he uncon-
sciously becomes a dramatist, and his
narrative becomes an epic. His dancing
is as personal and magnetic. But be-
tween this primitivism and Mr. Dandre’s
choreography there are thousands of
years of sophistication and convention-
making.
CAUBOY.
A Mime
on Pinero
It is difficult
to determ in e
whether the state-
ments made by
“Mime” ( B.
28 /11/ ’34) that
Pinero (1) “had been intellectually dead
for quarter of a century” ; (2) that “his
mind didn’t move with the times,” and
(3) that “he had nothing of importance
to say” are pitiful or childish.
One statement of importance, so far
as “Mime” is concerned, Pinero made,
viz. : “Of all forms of innocence mere
ignorance is the least admirable.” It
seems to fill the bill thoroughly.
The fact that, when Pinero handed the
script of “The Second Mrs. Tanqueray”
to John Hare, for whom it was designed.
Hare rejected it —was frightened of it,
in fact —proved that Pinero’s mind was in
advance of the times, as the overwhelm-
ing reception it received upon presenta-
tion by George Alexander clearly illus-
trated. In the interval 1881-93, Pinero
had swept the stage clear of the
“mechanical-rabbit” class of play, and
had “purged the stage of much perilous
stuff,” the presentations during that
period consisting mainly of poor adapta-
tions from the French. Pinero was also
first to deal a deadly blow to those “aids
to exposition” the “aside” and the “soli-
loquy,” which have since become extinct.
When the “new woman” was looming
in the 4 distance Pinero wrote “The Noto-
rious Mrs. Ebbsmith,” which caused
great discussion, especially the burning-
of-the-Bible incident.
In 1906 “His House in Order” was
produced and was admitted as showing
“great advancements made in dramatic
production.” It ran for over two years
at St. James’s Theatre. Then came
“The Thunderbolt” (1908), in which
Pinero drew the inimitable picture of the
actions of men and women when large
sums of money are at stake. Then came
“Mid-Channel,” more typical of the state
of affairs to-day than when Pinero wrote
it. He exposed the alarming state that
Society was drifting into by forsaking
its homes and huddling itself up in
flats and “having no time for brats of
children” — i.e., race-suicide. The same
may be said of the subject of “The Big
Drum”—it is just as typical of events to-
day, if not a great deal more so. Could
any one playwright have written those
three plays I have mentioned in suc-
cession?
To attempt to compare Shaw with
Pinero as a dramatist! As a playwright,
shaw wrote whole slabs of dialogue ; the
only purpose served was to keep the
pruning-knife in operation. Fie usually
wrote an introduction running into 50 or
60 pages explaining what the play was
about and why he wrote it.
When the sons of peers were marrying
chorus girls Pinero gave them “The Mind-
the-paint Girl.” A few lines concluding
the play might prove enlightening:
Lily Parradell (Lily Upjohn really,
about to marry Lord Farncombe): Ah,
poor Carlton! He’s losing all his best
girls. There’s Eva Shafto, Gwen Marker,
Maidie Trevail, and now me! Poor Carl-
ton!
Mrs. Upjohn (her mother, rocking her
to and fro like a baby): ’Ush, dearie, ’ush;
don’t think of ’im! Think of all the good
yer doin’ to the aristocracy!
I hope it is unnecessary to go further,
but if “Mime” wants it I’ll give it.
MID-CHANNEL.

a flood of blither about the book. “S.
M. Herald” says it “has an unfailing
fascination for small boys.... for it is
founded on the sure psychological foun-
dation of wish-fulfilment in the boyish
mind. Jim Hawkins follows a career
which must be envied by every healthy
boy” ; and The Bulletin termed it “the
best pirate yarn in the language.”
It is doubtful if any youngster,
“healthy” youngster in particular, has
ever really enjoyed the yarn. Those that
claim they have are those whose elders,
parents and school-teachers have been
most insistent on its being “the best in
the language.” “Treasure Island” strikes
the average boy of 12 as a hopelessly
watered story of adventure, and the law-
ful masters of the Hispaniola appear to
him a white-livered, psalm-singing, Bible-
thumping lot not at all measuring up to
the stature of “The Lone Wolf” or
“Hopalong” or “Mesquite Bill” or any
other of the real heroes he’s beginning
to know. Jim Hawkins he sees as a
moralising sissy; the little pleasure he
does get from the book is in imagining
what he’d have done in like circum-
stances.

No fewer than
137 works are be-
ing exhibited at
the Melbourne
Athenaeum by
Oscar Binder —
most of them pencil drawings. After
recent displays of artists suffering under
the spell of the modernists and the
cubists and the curvists and the rect-
angularists, Mr. Binder’s work comes
almost as an astounding surprise. The
trouble is that it is all too perfect.
His pencil drawings, which are out-
standingly his best work, are mostly
either portraits or nude studies. Both
are so carefully and delicately modelled
as to suggest excellent lithographs ; it is
difficult to discern the individual marks
of the pencil. One tone melts into
another imperceptibly. In his portraits
every wrinkle is depicted with meticulous
care, every shadow shows gradations
which the eye might miss. His nudes are
all too beautiful, both in form and face.
They reveal an excellent mastery of ana-
tomy, but they are so superbly perfect that
they pass the borderline of humanity into
that of fantasy. There is no suggestion of
the muscle beneath the flesh, the bone
beneath the muscle —nothing but the skin
you love to touch, an unbroken smooth-
ness of matt-surfaced satin. All the
same, Mr. Binder has contrived to miss
nothing of the sitter in the portraits,
nothing of the individuality in the nudes.
Possibly the most striking of the draw-
ings are the portraits of an abo. and a
Chinaman.
Once again James Flett uses an exhi-
bition as a weapon to biff the Gentiles
who don’t regard art in the same way as
he does. The catalogue of his show at the
Collegiate Gallery, Melbourne, bears on
the back a manifesto, a pronunciamento,
an excommunicado delivered at the here-
tics and pitying the misled public “who
have been fed on the art of those ven-
erable bumpkins of the dumb, Streeto-
nian, romantic conventions for the last
30 years.” Strangely enough, after hav-
ing been suitably amused by the ponti-
fical Mr. Flett, it is quite possible to be
charmed by the artistic Mr. Flett, for
his 14 water-colors illustrating nursery
rhymes are a delight. Imagination and
fantasy and color run riot, and run
it in the right direction. “Three
Blind Mice” is an exquisite example of
low-tone work —almost monochrome ;
“Tom, Tom, the Piper’s Son” is brilliant,
and “The Gnome Village” is a study of
contrasts. But why doesn’t Flett try
some low-tone appraisal of his fellow-
artists? Kipling wrote years ago: “There
are nine and sixty ways of constructing
tribal lays—and every single one of them
is right.”

Mrs. James Dyer is making a strenu-
ous effort towards the establishment of
a national theatre in Melbourne, but has
not yet outlined her scheme beyond stat-
ing that she had learned from experi-
ence that the matter could not safely
be left to Governments. Mrs. Dyer has
moved at the right time, artistically if
not financially. Every Australian capi-
tal witnesses the production of local plays
of considerable merit ruined by the poor
class of amateur actors who comprise
the tail of the companies. The best at-
tempt to establish such an institution was
made a few years back, when Louis
Esson started thp Pioneer Players, who
produced only Australian plays. Esson’s
actors, moreover, were kept together so
long that they learned to act, and though
there were no stars the cast of every pro-
duction was even and satisfactory.

BY APPOINTMENT TO H.R.H. THE PRINCE OF WALES
lan McEacharn escorted his cousin
Margaret Gulliver to the altar of St.
John’s, Toorak, for her marriage with
John Lobb. The bride, who clasped the
perfection of three or four creamy mag-
nolias, wore a white satin gown with a
panelled train, an Empire waistline and
a quaintly flared collar outlining the
wide bateau neck. Following her were
three ’maids —Barbara Weigall, who
walked alone, and Elizabeth Dutton-
Green and Lorna Oakley, side by. side.
Their ripe-corn frocks were of tulle
frilled and fluffed over taffetas, their
tulle hats were of thistledown lightness
and transparence and they carried sheafs
of gerberas varying in tint from pale
yellow to deep mustard. The ’groom’s
supporters were E. L. a’Beckett, F. R.
Bell and Herbert Darvall. Felicitations
reverberated at Grosvenor.
In “The Old Folks at Home” Grace
Lane, as Lady Kingdom, wears a ravish-
ing black tulle gown in which an idea
stolen from the ’nineties is primped and
perked, mixed with stiffened tulle and the
germ of a bustle and turned into a dorsal-
fin swooping down the back into a mer-
maid train. Jane Wood, as Liza, acknow-
ledges the return of the petticoat. Hers
is of white satin, and several inches of it
droop below the front of her white flat
crepe evening gown. It’s a lovely gown,
of perfect fit and workmanship, and it
displays to advantage Jane’s handsome
shoulders and back. But her very short
tangee shorts are not such a success.
Kathleen Goodall, as Sybil, who shares
an “astral plane” with Harvey Adams, as
Douglas, portrays the lure of black kid
gloves with an ice-blue turnout and the
attraction of large, dark, teacup-sized but-
tons running diagonally across the corsage
and outlining the placket of her dusty-
pink sports dress. Douglas displays a
healthy appetite ; he disposes of a plate
of haddock, five pieces of toast, large
blobs of butter and jam and two cups
of coffee for breakfast.
Dr. and Mrs. P. J. Flanagan’s daugh-
ter Joan is preparing to leave for abroad
early in February. Joan, who has stage
inclinations, has studied speech-training,
' singing and dancing and has on several
occasions spoken into the broadcasting
mike. On her arrival in London her am-
bitions will be put to the test at the
Academy of Dramatic Art.
A Melbourne businessman arrived
home on Christmas Eve looking pleased
with the gift of an acquaintance, a large
demijohn of whisky. During the holi-
days he brought a carload of his golfing
pals home for a drink. Glasses were
raised with cheery smiles, which turned
to wry grimaces at the taste of the stuff.
After much discussion and a temporary
suspicion of the donor of the gift, the
host tackled his son and heir, aged three.
Small Robbie started off by stout denials,
but gradually the cross-examination wore
him down, and he admitted putting a
“per-weetie” into the whisky. More
questions elucidated the information that
a “per-weetie” is a mothball.
Some of the newest mirrors are
double-faced —one surface dull and the
other shiny. One side gives the effect of
a complexion seen in daylight though
the actual make-up is acquired in electric
light. With the aid of the reverse side a
woman may tinker with rouge, eye-
shadow, etc., in daylight and see the
result as it will appear at an evening
function.
THE LITTLE SISTERS.
WESTRALIA.
Sartorial efforts for the second day at
Ascot were mixed; raincoats marched
with chiffons, furs with muslin and sturdy
umbrellas with frilly parasols. The
brightest patch of color was the border of
petunias which made a brave show from
the birdcage to the Leger. A silver fox
stole over the icebergs on Mrs. Keith
Mclntyre’s dark marocains; Mrs. Doug-
las Gawler introduced a warmer note
with russet matt crepe threaded in gold ;
Madame Gelle’s sweeping satins matched
the sward, and Mrs. Geoff Lynn attached
gold raglan sleeves to her bronzine
crepes.
Karrinyup Country Club was literally
banked with flowers for its first party in
1935. China rails, fireplaces and mantels,
tables and every available nook and
cranny were resplendent with blooms, the
pink and blue of hydrangeas predomi-
nating. Dancers slipped from the lounge
to the verandah with its festoons of
colored lights, and thence to the supper
marquee erected on the lawn. Mrs. Shelly
Barker’s crystals shone on the organising
chair; Mollie Learmonth’s blush-pink
crepes were near by; Muffle and Elise
Forrest, Ursula and Joan Goyder and
Molly Mahood were in one party, with
Molly’s bougainvillaea georgettes swirling
around in an enveloping cloud ; Barbara
Clarke’s heavy cream lace was beslashed
at the back ; Mrs. Lindsay Male ruched
the hem on her snowy taffetas with petal-
like loops ; Mrs. Silverston’s apple-green
taffetas were embossed with silver ; and
Mrs. T. Lewis finished her beige laces
with a cowl neck.
Eight am. dram, performers presented
Eric Hudson’s “The Unfair Sex,” played
to an invited audience of 300-odd. The
Assembly Hall wore its new suit of
stucco, and after the show guests poured
into the adjacent McNess Hall for re-
freshments and dancing.
The Perth Cup was Tun in perfect
weather, and feminine racegoers did
justice to the day. Zoe Wier caught
the eye with pervenche-blue ripple crepe,
shoulder-strapped with black and bearing
a wide black front under an eye-and-a-
half-concealing black cartwheel; Mrs.
R. A. Cameron’s riot of roses grew on a
wall of cream georgette, latticed with
satin and shaded with leghorn; Mrs.
Frank Lefroy tied a bow at the waist of
her checked blue nets; Lorna Sidney-
Smith hid her gown with a sweeping black
taffeta cloak, and kept her little black
headpiece in position with a band of
buds in lieu of elastic ; Mrs. Harry Vin-
cent’s haze of floral-blue chiffons was
shaded with a two-foot circumference of
blue ballibuntal, and the Collister twins,
Joy and Joan, turned up the backs of
their brown coolie hats, which matched
their frilled checked taffetas.
The backwash of the. Hindustan
brought a ripple of romance to Phyl
Hope Robertson, who has announced her
engagement to Lieut. George Moger, of
the R.I.N.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
The period after Christmas is generally
dull in Adelaide, but owing to the visit of
Sir Archibald and Lady Weigall things
socially have been brighter than usual.
Mrs. John Baker came to town from
Mount Lofty to give a luncheon party ;
Dr. and Mrs. Roy Burston entertained
the Weigalls at a dinner, and there were
many other social engagements that
Lady Weigall managed to fit in. She
found time also to visit every charitable
institution of which she had been patron-
ess during her term at Government
House, and to entertain at tea those who
had been employed on the G.H. staff 13
years ago.
Prior to their departure the Weigalls
gave a large dinner party at the South
Australian, followed by a dance at which
they entertained about 300 guests. The
ballroom had the huge mirrors com-
pletely framed in gladioli, the fireplace
and overmantel being banked with the
same flowers. Lady Weigall looked
charming in pale-blue dull satin trimmed
with silk fringe, and sported a tiara
of emeralds and diamonds. Priscilla
Weigall was a tall and graceful figure in
pale-pink-and-silver-striped marocain on
diagonal lines. Mrs. H. H. Dutton,
recently returned from England, wore her
presentation gown of soft ivory satin
with pearl ornaments. Mrs. R. Dutton’s
ice-blue taffeta frock had a quaint turned-
up hem, and a ruffle of the same silk
worn round the neck supported the
bodice. The Sowden lady was gowned
in white satin merging into a train
trimmed with knife-pleated frills.
Mayor and Mayoress Cain commenced
1935 with a cheery party in the Mayor-
ess’s reception-room, and everyone was
pleased to see Mrs. Cain acting again
as hostess. She has been fortunate in
having a daughter like Mrs. H. Dunstan
to assist her so ably in entertaining. Mrs.
Cain was gowned in black lace, and Mrs.
Dunstan wore smart pale-apple-green
marocain.
Mr. and Mrs. James Dyer, of Mel-
bourne, spent a few days with William
Sowden and his lady at Castlemaine,
Victor Harbor, before leaving for Eng-
land by the Oronsay. Mr. Dyer is the
Sowden lady’s uncle.
TASMANIA.
Captain lan Matheson bade farewell
to a big crowd of friends at a cocktail
party in Hadley’s lounge before leaving
to join his regiment in England. Mrs.
Matheson (his mother) wore string-
colored lace on black satin. Lady Clark
was in powder-blue lace with small coat.
The new A.D.C. to his Ex. is Lieut.-
Col. L. W. Wilmer (retired), who has been
on the personal staff of several Gover-
nors during the last few years. He was
last with Sir John Goodwin in Queens-
land. Joan McLennan, erstwhile Arch-
bishop Head’s private sec., fills the niche
left empty by Miss Macdonald.
Mrs. Ross-Hewton presided over the
big meeting of members of various
women’s committees who wanted to
show Mrs. Hollingsworth, Launceston’s
late Mayoress, how they had appreciated
her leadership. The party was held in
the lounge of the Brisbane Hotel. The
presentation of a crystal bowl was a
feature of the proceedings.
Matron and staff of the Launceston
Hospital gave a dance at the Crystal
Palais, and the medical world of the
north turned up in strength. Bright-
colored cloths on the supper-tables and
gay-hued flowers everywhere made a
cheery hop still more cheerful.
The Golf Carnival Week was a stern
test of players’ qualifications, since the
weather would have been thought over
the odds even by the Spartans of St.
Andrews. By the end of the time a
great part of the Kingston Beach Links
was under water. But those who took
cottages or stayed at the guest-houses
played every day and had plenty of
energy left for bridge in the evening.
Gertrude and Violet White-Parsons
are home from their trip to Europe. Mrs.
G. L. Creasey (their sister) gave a wel-
come-home tea-party for them at the
Brisbane Hotel, Launceston.
“G.M.”; Robert Kaleski’s comment
on the Henry Lawson statue reminds
me that I suggested to George Lam-
bert, before he started to execute the
commission, that he might glance at a
tiny pen-and-ink tailpiece of Lawson which
Frank P. Mahony had drawn for The
Bulletin about 20 years before. Lam-
bert replied that his conception of the
figure followed on similar lines, but the
result left me with much the same feel-
ings as Kaleski. The tailpiece I refer
to was absolutely characteristic of the
poet. It showed him ambling along witfi
that peculiar gait of his, swag on back,
pipe in mouth, and with his dog—a
genuine kelpie—following at his heel. It
was the real Lawson. The only other
picture I know of which gives the real
man is the so-called caricature—dt is
really a portrait—which Low turned out
In color. That drawing should certainly
be in the N.S.W. National Gallery.'
“M.G.”: The hour, occasionally if not
invariably, produces the man. In Mel-
bourne the other day a big stable caught
fire and the horses were in, grave danger
of being burned to death ; the flames were
so intense that even the firemen regarded
it as hopeless to attempt a save. Sud-
denly a. man burst through the crowd
and, evading all attempts to detain him,
plunged into the stables. 1 ; The hose was
played on him to give him a fair chance
of success, and before he dashed out, he
had freed 11 horses. It recalls an inci-
dent in Sydney some years ago. A mad
Chinaman had run amok with a re-
volver, and had taken refuge in his shack
in Surry Hills, firing at everybody who
approached. The police were standing
off, waiting for the fire-hose to flood the
man out, when a tall, sombreroed figure
butted in with the request “Gimme a
gun—a reg’lar gun.” A revolver was
proffered, and he strolled over to the
Chinaman’s house and bashed in the door
with his shoulder. Shots were heard ;
then the stranger appeared at the door
beckoning all and sundry. He restored
the borrowed weapon, glanced at the
dead Chinaman, murmuring “I’m sorry,
old Chink, but I had to do it,” and
handed over a card inscribed “James
Ryan, late deputy sheriff, Arizona.” Then
he drifted off to newspaper offices to be
photographed and interviewed.

THE commencement of the whole
business lay with the service of
Dubbin and Company’s writ.
When the bailiff opened the wire door
of the Myall Cafe (grills at all hours)
Nicholas was in the kitchen. Not that
there was any occasion for him to be
occupied there, but he felt happier in
that part of the premises.
He liked to feel the warm blast of the
oven on his face, and it was well do be
prepared for a chance customer. Hear-
ing the short jangle of the counter bell
he wiped his broad face on a grubby tea-
towel and went into the shop.
“Ah, Nick. Hot day,” said the bailiff,
fumbling in his breastpocket and with-
drawing the writ from its musty secrecy.
Nicholas felt the cheerfulness leave his
face, very much as dishwater trickles
down the grooves of a draining-board.
Hypnotically he watched the Court s
officer produce the four-folded document
and proffer it.
“Hah! Good morn-
ing, Mis’ O’Brien,” he
returned, and received
the wretched thing.
It was the third with
which he had been
served in the past week.
But when his brown
eyes gathered in the full
significance of Dubbin
and Company’s claim
they fairly bulged in
dismay.
“That’s the copy,
Nicholas,” remarked
the bailiff.
Nicholas made no
reply to that. Nor to the
man’s assurance that it
was damned hot outside.
When the door slammed
he leaned against the
counter, staring first at the writ and then
about the shop. He sighed. His brown
face was incredibly doleful. One fat
tear squeezed itself into the corner of
each eye, trembled, scampered down his
“Jus’ broke ... Done in!”
cheek and, with a perceptible
plop, dropped on the paper.
Reluctant to admit to himself
the full import of this last cala-
mity, he read the matter of the claim
again.
In all the immutability of print it spoke
its uncompromising demand. Dubbins
required a matter of £96 and odd for
overdue instalments on the ornate soda-
fountain, the hearty hissing of which
spoke no more of sundaes and squashes
for the thirsty youth of the town
Ninety-six pounds twelve shillings. And
costs.
For a long time the proprietor of the
Myall stood dejectedly in his shabby and
unpatronised shop. Outside a hot wind
sent erratic whips of dust across the
street. The wheels of a passing .sulky
crackled on the road metal. Two women
paused and looked in at the shop win-
dow. But the stale and gelid sweets with
which it was filled held no enticement
for them. No. Nor the pallid saveloys
which lay upon a china dish.
Four flies derisively crawled down the
window-pane.
“No use. No use,”
Nicholas whispered to
himself. “No more use
fighting . . . Jus’ —jus
broke . . . Done in!”
THEN in a pathetic
gust of rage he
tore the writ into small
pieces and put them
into the jar of sour
gherkins standing by
the scales.
Slowly he stared
round the shop. The
half - dozen empty
tables, each one cov-
ered with its worn pat-
terned oilcloth, mocked
him. So did the foun-
tain, tarnished and
spotted, and the empty smallgoods
display case. From that he gazed
around and at the dusty stock upon the
shelves. Boiled lollies. Biscuits. Bottled
olives.
At the farther end, tinned oysters.
Eleven dozen!
Bah! What a fool he must have been.
Eleven dozen. Oysters.
Softly he swore, sniffled and dejectedly
toyed with the ring on his finger.
So there it was. Dubbins signed
judgment in due course, and, as was
only to be expected, there came a day
when O’Brien, the bailiff, stood in the
shop again. But this time with a dif-
ferent kind of writ. In two words, he
was in possession.
“You mean”
Poor Nicholas, monotonously twirling
his ring, found it poignant to confirm
his own understanding of the situation.
“I mean, Nick, that if the money’s not
paid in five days I’ve got to sell the shop
up. Sorry—dashed sorry, you know ; but
I haven’t a say in the matter.”
“No. You haven’t a say in the matter,”
Nicholas echoed. Then shrugging his
shoulders and spreading his broad hands:
“Ver’ well, Mis’ O’Brien, sell heem up.
... .paused and looked in at the
window.
I got no money, and Dubbins can have
my shop an’ go to hell. Eh?”
He Went back to the kitchen.
There, for a while, he cried. Then he
wrote a letter to his mother, who owned
a small vineyard on a hill which ran
down to the fringe of a blue sea. That
was in Greece.
SURELY enough, the sale advertise-
ments appeared. The townspeople
stared at the shop in a kind of curiosity.
Often they saw Nicholas and the bailiff
seated at one of the small tables playing
dominoes. The days slipped over. In
less than no time (or so it seemed) the
morning of the sale dawned. Nicholas
dressed himself in his best clothes and
wore the heavy silver watch-chain which
once had belonged to his father, who had
been a faithful clerk. That was what the
large medal said.
When the bidding commenced there
might have been seventy people in the
shop. Old Tramcott, who kept the store
opposite, was one of them, although, as
Mrs. Twill remarked to Miss Bottle, that
was not surprising, as the old gentleman
would walk three miles for a good bar-
gain. (Miss Twill was wearing that blue
print voile of her married daughter’s.)
Punctually at ten, O’Brien stepped
from a chair on to the counter and set
about business. Nicholas sat with his
head in his hand and prepared to take
notes with a two-inch pencil butt.
“Well, ladies and gents.,” commenced
O’Brien, “I propose to start on the fur-
nishings and fittings ; then, in order, we’ll
do the stock.” He cleared his throat
loudly, and rocked on his heels. “Now,
Lot 1: Six stout and faithfully made
caffee tables —tough, strong and in every
way suitable for use as —as tables . . .
What offers for the tables? What am I
offered, ladies and gentlemen, for the
tables?”
Several of his audience, with a know-
ing air, proceeded to examine the desig-
nated items. They turned them up,
smacked their tops and bottoms, until,
urged insistently by the bailiff, a male
voice offered ten bob the lot.
Nicholas glared and groaned quietly
to himself. By dint of much persuasion
O’Brien knocked them down for twenty-
one shillings to young Slake, who kept
the furniture shop four doors lower
down.
The chairs went next, for two shillings
each.
Then, in turn, were knocked down
cups and saucers, dishes, fourteen thick
glasses, linoleum and a couple of cloudy
mirrors—all of them for sums which un-
questionably struck the unhappy Nicho-
las to the heart. From time to time he
sighed with a ponderous and sibilant
exhalation of his breath. Withal, he
seemed nervous. He persistently
drummed his thick fingers on the table
edge, and occasionally gnawed at the
ragged remnant of a thumbnail.
In an unbidden obtrusion his mother
and the father who had been a faithful
clerk perpetually returned to his
thoughts. All about, the unhurried,
merciless process of the bailiff s sale con-
tinued.
AT last, the stock. But it was difficult
to dispose of, and Dubbin and Com-
pany’s claim was a long way from being
satisfied. Besides, many of those who
... smelt vaguely of smoke.
were in the shop had obviously grown
tired of the proceedings. Those were
the ones who had attended only out of

One hundred years ago the financial needs of
the nation were supplied by a few banks whose
entire capital was approximately £1,500,000.
To-day, the reserves alone of the National Bank
stand at £3,000,000 —just twice the total of all
bank capital in Australia a century ago.
Always adhering to the ideals of safety, soundness
and progress, the National Bank has played its
part in the national and business life of the
Commonwealth, and has built up a widespread
organisation covering 425 offices in Australia,
two branches in London and a world-wide chain
of banking agents.
To-day, the Bank, with the experience of 76
years of national service, makes available
facilities directed towards encouraging the further
expansion of Australian industries and assisting
their safe and effective operation.

curiosity. Once, indeed, Sep Trivett the
blacksmith stepped over to Nicholas.
“Nicholas,” said he, “I’m downright
sorry for this business. Yes, by gosh, I
am.”
His sooty forehead wrinkled in a mani-
fest compassion. He smelt vaguely of
smoke and hoof-parings. But Nicholas
barely raised his head, and his fingers
fumbled for the ring which was not on
his hand,
“Thankya, Sep,”
he replied ; and no
• more.
The bailiff was
approaching th e
end.
“. . . and last,
but not —ha, ha —
not least, ladies and
gents., we have
this large stock of
choice plump
oysters.” His fin-
gers rapped the
faded label en-
circling one of the
tins. “Oysters.
From —let me see
—yes, I thought as
much from
Torres Strait.
Oysters! What a
romantic word!
The interesting
thing about an
oyster, ladies and gents., is that you never
know what’s inside it”
“A bad smell, probably,” someone of
his audience rudely interjected, whereat
a gust of giggling ran round the room.
“To commence with,” resumed the
auctioneer, not a whit abashed, “we —l
—propose knockin’ ’em down in lots of
half £ dozen, just to give the housewives
a chance. But, since everyone’s entitled
to have an idea of what they’re buying,
we’ll open a tin. Any tin, ladies and
gents.”
He suited the action to the word, and,
leaning back, drew a tin from the centre
stack.
Nicholas wiped his face with an im-
mense handkerchief, and the faithful
clerk’s silver medal chinked on its chain.
The bailiff resumed;
“My good friend Nicholas might
oblige with a tin-opener ' and a dish.
Thank you . . . Mr. Slake, will you be
so good as to open the tin?”
In a small turgid torrent of green water
the contents slopped out into a soup-
plate on the counter. There they lay,
hideous and malevolent-looking.
Nicholas was seated at the table again,
and, so it appeared, watching the pro-
I ceedings with an apathetic eye.
IT was the bailiff who first discovered
* something odd about the oysters.
“Taste one, madam! Taste one! Why
I’ll set an example if you’re nervous.”
He held the glistening mollusc between
a thumb and finger. “A dainty fit for
a king, ha, ha! Yes —fit—fit —fit”
His jaw fell and his eyes opened. Fool-
ishly, as his listeners gaped at him, he
turned the oyster between the ends of
his finger and thumb. Then looked at
it. As he drew something from its
bruised flesh a faint cry escaped him.
He let the oyster fall to the floor.
“A p-pearl! A pearl” .. ,
In an idiotic bewilderment he looked
about. But Nicholas bounded to his
feet and dashed to the counter.
“Sare, you can’t sella da pearl. It is
a lie, people. Jus’ a dirty lie to make
you buy my oyster”
But the dumbfounded audience was
crowding to the counter by then, and in
their avid eagerness many had leapt upon
the chairs and tables. The discordant
“A p-pearl!”
noise of shouts, exclamations and in-
quiries made the small shop a bedlam.
It was minutes before the bailiff could
resume. Even then poor Nicholas
clenched and unclenched his hands as he
poured out his grievance to the sergeant.
But it seemed that nothing could be done!
The bailiff in selling the pearl was on firm
ground. That indubitably was sound law.
From that point the sale was a fever-
ish process, the like
of which never
had been seen in
the town before.
The second, third
and fourth lots
were sold for
twenty - four shil-
lings a tin. No
pearls. The third
tin of the fifth lot
held a splendid
specimen— not
large, but un-
questionably of an
incomparable lim-
pidity and shape.
The confusion and
bad language were
disgraceful, and no
sooner were the
lots knocked down
than the purchaser
ripped open his
prizes, and turned
out their contents
on the floor.
Old Tramcott started a fight with the
publican, and, when bidding recom-
menced, set about buying in serious
earnest. The bailiff’s voice was inaudible
at times. A crowd collected outside.
The shop reeked of oysters—antique
and malodorous. Nicholas was ready to
swoon with rage and despair. The fifth
lot brought twelve pounds. The sixth,
fifteen guineas. In the twelfth, another
pearl. Confusion and madness unutter-
able. A fury of insensate bidding made old
Tramcott savagely ludicrous. He raced
for the bank, and not a few with him.
WHEN the afternoon was closing, the
oysters were sold. Three pearls.
The shop was a stinking shambles.
With the bailiff Nicholas, who seemed
more resigned now that the crowd had
gone, went into figures. Certainly the
sale should have stopped when Dubbin
and Company’s claim and costs were dis-
charged. But no one seemed to have
thought of that. So the writ was settled.
Until it was time for Nicholas to catch
the night train to Sydney, he played what
looked like dominoes with the bailiff, the
two of them sitting on a dry space of
the floor. Their game (if it was dom-
inoes) was played by candle-light. Both
of them seemed to have won.
For when Nicholas closed the shop
door (and for the last time), the bailiff
walked with him almost to the station.
They shook hands at parting, and
laughed once or twice. Then they said
“Don’t mention it” to each other.
Seated in the train Nicholas sighed,
watching the town lights glimmer and
fade. He was the one occupant of a
box compartment. Once he patted his
inner breast pocket as though to reassure
himself. Then, from his waistcoat pocket
he drew a finger-ring. He sighed again.
Perhaps he grieved, seeing three small
cavities which once held pearls.
He hoped no one would notice those
small solder marks on three of the
oyster-tins. The smell of train smoke
made him drowsy. He slept. In a dim
dream he saw a small vineyard on a hill
which ran down to the fringe of a blue
sea, and heard the jovial voice of his
dead father who, upon a time, had been
a faithful clerk.
IN THE BRACKEN.
Little wild things move among the bracken —
Meadow-mice and furry, leaf-brown hares —
Rabbits thumping through the windless hollows,
And beetles climbing twisted, grassy stairs.
Mumbling bees,
Resting their wings a space,
Push through the canopies
Of ferny lace
With bags of golden treasure plucked
From the prim gardens of the town;
White butterflies wing down,
And lizards, blue and green like lustred gems,
Lie sunning in between the brittle stems.
Lilac sand shows palely through the bracken—
Spongy moss of bronze and amber hues—
Orchids frail as silk, and winged like fairy
swallows,
And dripping honey-dews.
Cloistered in soaring green-arched fronds
Lie little cool, unruffled ponds
Where water-spiders skate,
And every floating lily-leaf holds fast
Its silver freight.
Rich and tawny glows the turning bracken,
Rust and ochre, red as fishing-sails,
Thrusting up the furrows where the she-oaks
Spill more color from their tattered veils.
Dull and pallid stands the long-dead bracken,
Grey as ash that smears the burnt-out sky,
Closing with its frail and lacy ruins
Round the leprous toadstools rank and high.
If I could sleep one night among the bracken —
If I could sleep alone and secretly,
My head upon the harsh, sun-smelling pillow,
The warm earth pressing close and close
to me—
If I could sleep untouched, uncaring, so —
(My breath the breath of earth and stems and
leaves)
Until the first cock hailed
The coming morning, and the sky
Shivered with pearly light and paled,
I think that I
Should come at last to know
Some ultimate, sweet consolation that would
keep
My soul immune from worthless fears, and
drown
The little nameless griefs that weigh me down!
VICTORIA.

A well-known Melbourne doctor
recently said “I have some very nice
things to say about Roboleine. It is
the finest preparation I have come
across. I had a case recently of an
infant who was declining rapidly and
they tried everything at the clinic without avail. All I di
down his feed andput him on Roboleine. He picked up almost immed ‘ at^y
has never looked back since. I shall be delighted to recommend Roboleine
wherever possible.”
What more convincing proof could there be, that there is nothing like Sloholeine.
And this is only one of many testimonials given by doctors and hosp«al staff
everywhere during the last 25 years. Roboleine contains no drugs. It consists
solely of concentrated nourishment combined in a special way, rich in vitamins A,
B C and D so 6 that it is immediately absorbed by the weakened system and rapidly
transformed into good red blood and healthy tissue.
If you have a child who is not thriving, try Roboleine. Many mothers have
blessed the day when this wonderful tonic food first came into their home.

My Political
Life
By W. A. HOLMAN
SEARCH FOR
A SPEAKER
The state of
things with which
Parliament had
opened had not
been restored by our struggles. Our
majority of two, which had then seemed
so trifling and precarious a foothold, now
looked like an absolute rock of salvation
trom which we were being swept away
in spite of our most desperate efforts to
regain it.
It fell to my lot accordingly, when
Ministers met after the two by-elections
in a somewhat chastened mood, to rouse
the drooping spirits of my colleagues.
I pointed out that the Liverpool Plains
result was certainly not a true indication
of the feeling of the electorate ; that 1
had already had reports indicating
serious irregularities in the conduct o
that election ; that we might get it upset
on appeal, and that at a further by-
election we ought to win.
To have a further by-election at
Liverpool Plains the result of the present
elections must be upset; to do that there
must be an appeal; to entertain an
appeal there must be an Elections and
Qualifications Committee; to appoint
such a committee there must be a
Speaker. Here was the rub. How were
we to get a Speaker out of a House with
45 members on each side? Clearly we
could not carry on at all unless this
question could be answered.
ENTER
HENRY WILLIS
It was at this
point that Grif-
fith performed a
second great ser-
vice to the party. It was he who
suggested that Henry Willis, a new
and indepen-
d e n t-minded
member of the
O p p o s ition,
might possibly
be willing to
act, and under-
took to sound
him. He did
so, and shortly
afterwards was
able to report
that Willis was
quite favorably
disposed to the
idea. I accord-
ingly had an in-
terview with
Willis myself,
and explained
the whole posi-
Willis.
tion as we saw it —that we believed the
Liverpool Plains result was quite mis-
leading and that we really had our major-
ity unimpaired; that we wanted a tem-
porary continuance of the House to allow
us to test this ; that if it should prove
that we were wrong we would dissolve
thereafter and go to the country, but
only if we found that the majority with
which we had entered Parliament had
permanently disappeared.
It is only bare justice to Willis to say
that he accepted the arrangement upon
terms which were dictated by a keen
regard for his own personal dignity. He
understood, of course, that had we not
been in difficulties the offer would never
have been made, and that to that extent
he was forced upon us ; but he made it
perfectly clear that he would not be a
stopgap Speaker. Up to the decision of
the Liverpool Plains by-election there
was to be no controversial legislation in-
troduced, and after that he was to be free
to either carry on or resign as his per-
sonal judgment might dictate.
A special Labor Conference, called for
some purpose which I do not remember,
met in one of Sydney’s larger halls the
very night before Parliament reassembled.
By this time practically every prediction
of Dacey’s had been fulfilled. The move-
ment had not only begun to think that
there might be no such short cut to an
end of all our troubles as Fisher had
outlined, but bad also justified Dacey’s
other prophecy that it would revise its
comparisons between the Federal and
the State men. It was regarded as a
matter for amazement that in a Labor
world, such as Australia was now taken
to be, it should be possible to put for-
ward an official Labor proposal like
Fisher’s referendum and find, when the
numbers went up, that it was beaten.
Such an awakening came as a very great
shock to many. True, some of the more
fanatic spirits were still ready to say that
it was because we were not united that
there had not been a complete victory,
and that we State dissentients had
brought about the failure. But on the
whole the responsibility for it was rightly
attributed to the bad management of the
Federal leaders. One section of the con-
ference deprecated their pose of indiffer-
ence to the ordinary considerations of
fair dealing with colleagues. Others,
while less alert in the sphere of pure
ethics, were equally alive to their practical
unsatisfactoriness. As against this our
own plucky, and so far successful,
handling of the enormous difficulties
which had confronted us had aroused
much sympathy. The State men got a
surprisingly cordial reception here, and
my own address was received with great
enthusiasm.
OPPOSITION
AND WILLIS
Next day the
House met. The
grief, anger and
consternation of
Oppositionists when they learnt that we
were meeting the Chamber with a nomi-
nation for the Speakership knew no
bounds. The fighting members of the
party —and they were many—had counted
upon the absolute impossibility of our
proceeding with business and an almost
immediate dissolution. With Willis in
the chair it was obvious that we should
be carrying on business with a majority,
and might do so over an indefinite period.
They accordingly took counsel together
as to how this last development on our
side might be nullified.
Peculiarly favorable —one might say
tempting —opportunities for obstructive
tactics are offered by the rules of the
House governing elections of Speakers.
The guiding principle of the position is
simple—if anything, too simple. Until
a Speaker has been elected a House can
do no business, because there is no one
in the Chair to state a question or an-
nounce the decision of the House. Simi-
larly, no member can be called to order.
There is no one to call him to order.
No member can be shut down, because
the motion “that he be no further heard”
cannot be put —there is no one to put it.
Further, no member can be ejected for
disorderly conduct. The Clerk of the
House is empowered by a special Stand-
ing Order to call on members to speak
as they rise, and also to take the vote
when the moment for voting comes, but
he has no other powers. The Clerk,
Arnold, by the way, was absent on leave
at- this time, but his place was filled by
the Second Clerk, Mowle. There is
usually a general agreement to pass
through this difficult period as rapidly as
possible, and even if a trial of strength
takes place between the supporters of
rival aspirants to the Chair it is taken
quickly and without unnecessary words.
Should, however, feeling run high, and
this self-denying ordinance be broken
through, there is no provision in the
Standing Orders by which the House
could impose any restraint upon the
wildest ebullitions of its members.
METHODS OF
OBSTRUCTION
It was resolved
by the Opposition
on this occasion
to exploit the
opportunities thus offered to the utter-
most. They determined to bring the
business of the House to a standstill and
make the election of a Speaker impos-
sible. This could be done by protract-
ing the debate interminably. Every
member was to speak, and to speak at
great length; having spoken, he was to
take a rest and be prepared when called
upon to come into the House and speak
again; and if necessary again and again
at even greater length. There would be
no established authority to keep any
member to the point or to prevent any
member speaking two, three or, if he saw
fit, a hundred times. With vigorous

leadership and a little organisation—and
t ese were readily forthcoming—it was
felt that a stone wall might be erected
right across the path of further Parlia-
mentary business. After 30, 40 or 50
hours of continuous debate, punctuated,
as was to be expected, by dashes of
more or less serious disorder, the Lieut.-
Governor would be satisfied of the im-
possibility of expecting anything from
so chaotic an Assembly, and might, it
was hoped, exercise his right of dissolv-
mg it. Such was the scheme—and a very
good scheme, too—which we had to
meet in the opening hours of the new
session.
It is only fair to admit, now that the
whole incident has sunk into the past,
that in its beginning this plan worked
well. After Willis had been duly
nominated by Messrs. George Black and
Robert Scobie, two sturdy Caledonian
Ministerialists, the stream of oratory
poured forth remorselessly. Willis had
been a member of the Federal Par-
liament and a frequent and copious par-
ticipant in the debates of that body. It
was accordingly to the Federal “Han-
sard that Opposition members now
turned for material to form the subject
of invective against our inoffensive
nominee. It was stonewalling *made
easy. Any member could rise with a
volume of the Federal “Hansard” in
his hand and say: “Mr. Mowle, I pro-
pose, by way of demonstrating the utter
unfitness of this ruffian to preside over
this House, to quote a few passages
from a speech which he made only three
years ago in another Parliament.” He
would then unfalteringly go through
column after column of the “Hansard”
report of the unfortunate Willis’s con-
tribution to a debate on the tax on tea
or the administration of the Northern
Territory. Material was there in vast
abundance. No one could prevent its
employment, or the widest and most
irrelevant range of comment on every
sentence of it.
Points of order were occasionally
taken by exasperated Ministerialists, but
Mowle very properly refused to take any
notice of them. The Opposition always
had two or three men waiting, each with
his load of books, ready to step in and
explain to the listening earth or the
empty benches, whichever it might be,
the peculiar abhorrence which his soul
felt for the sentiments uttered by Willis
in connection with some great theme
which had once exercised the House of
Representatives, while a group of scowl-
ing Government supporters could merely
Cohen.
look on in impotent annoyance. The
remaining Oppositionists were at any
given moment of the night resting, pre-
paring for their turn, or, if they had
already had it, for renewed efforts when
their turn came round again. The effort
was perfectly planned, perfectly man-
aged. There was no visible reason why
it should ever stop. It was to have been
the greatest Parliamentary beanfeast in
history.
But the more active minds of the
Ministerial camp were not inert. I
have already had occasion to speak of
Dacey and of his non-inclusion in the
Ministry, where the luck of the ballot
had gone against him. Dacey had
the misfortune—particularly hard upon
a public man—of being an unattractive
speaker. He made fine speeches, the
matter of which was always excellent, but
he had a hard and rather difficult enun-
ciation. This, as always in politics, led
to a general under-estimation of his in-
tellect and qualities. As a matter of
fact, he was, as an experienced all-round
Parliamentarian, almost without rival in
the House.
DACEY’S
DEVICE
The crisis then
before us was
particularly the
kind to appeal to
his clear, unresting brain. Early in the
evening he put to me a suggestion that
with a little careful handling there need
be no necessity to take a vote upon the
election of Speaker at all. At the moment
I waved this impatiently aside, gs the
crude idea of a layman dealing with a
legal matter. After midnight, however,
when the Niagara of denunciation had
been pouring down for some hours and
everybody had become accustomed to its
steady thunder, and by consequence
something like quiet thinking was again
possible, Dacey came to me a second
time, and this time insisted upon my
going carefully over the whole of the
Standing Orders bearing on the matter
with him.
Now the Standing Orders are remark-
able. If there are two candidates nomi-
nated there must be a vote, and the vote
is taken by the Clerk of the House under
special rules which give him that power
and no other. Of course, the Clerk can-
not take the vote until the debate has
terminated; that is, until every indi-
vidual member who so desires has ex-
hausted himself; and the Opposition’s
plan, as I have explained, was to post-
pone for ever, by the simple process of
keeping the debate going, any taking of
the vote. But the Standing Orders also
provide that where only one candidate is
nominated a vote is not to be taken at
all and the candidate is “called” to the
Chair by the fine old Anglo-Saxon
method of bawling out his name at the
appropriate moment. This was a revela-
tion. It was obvious that the Opposition,
in spite of the large number of legal men
in its ranks, had overlooked this point,
for up to that moment it had failed
to nominate a second candidate. The
truth is, I believe, that it was so con-
fident that the whole of the proceedings
would end in a gigantic fiasco that it
had not wished to implicate any of its
own men in the ridicule which it felt
must ultimately attend on the attempted
election. So far, therefore, as Dacey
insisted, it had net created any neces-
sity for any division at all. I repented
instantly of my earlier indifference to
Dacey’s counsel. At any time some
slumbering mind in the Opposition might
awaken to the existence of this gap -in
its scheme and a second name be
brought forward. It was obvious that
not a moment was to be lost. Exactly
at this point, however, a great many
moments were lost—most exasperatingly.
Our candidate had taken the first neces-
sary formal step—that of “submitting
himself to the will of the House”—in a
speech which was appropriately concise.
The remaining necessary formal step was
that he should be conducted to the Chair
—after being “called” by the House—by
his proposer and seconder. Now just at
this crucial moment, when we thought
we saw this way out of our difficulty,
neither proposer nor seconder was to be
found. Messrs. Black and Scobie were
two of the senior members of the House,
and after the efforts and continuous ex-
citement of the day were now having a
quiet sleep in some of the many rooms
which the building contains, and for some
time could not be located. I was afraid
to show too much concern, for fear of
conveying to the penetrating intelligences
in the Opposition camp some hint that
a move was on foot, and in the atmo-
sphere of excitement which prevailed I
was equally afraid to discuss the possi-
bilities of the situation with our own men.
Dacey and I accordingly beat around
together from room to room. We ulti-
mately unearthed Scobie in one of
them, and roused Black from his thor-
oughly well-earned slumbers in an-
other. These two gentlemen were in-
structed to casually straggle into the
Chamber at five-minute intervals and
take up a commanding position near
Willis, who had endured, with iron for-
titude, the hours of vitriolic denunciation
of which the debate had so far consisted.
This was done. The next thing was to
arrange the coup itself.
WILLIS
BECOMES
SPEAKER
The original
en t h usiasm of
our own men for
the election of
Willis had not
been specially
warm, but it had been rekindled by the
exasperation with which they had en-
dured the experience of the night. There
was, therefore, no difficulty about getting
a little stage army ready to go in and
make “the call of the House” at any
given moment. We thought at the time
that we must effect some break in the
unending chain of speakers (though I
have always held since that this was un-
necessary). Accordingly, at the close of
one of the speeches from the Opposi-
tion, Thrower (a Ministerialist), acting
under instructions, caught Mowle’s eye,
addressed him by name two or three
times, and then turned as though to
obtain some water, and by these and
other artless manoeuvres delayed the
commencement of his speech for a
minute or so. The faithful supporters of
Willis, naturally eager to nominate him
(as I had occasion to point out a few
days later when the matter came up for
discussion in a full-dress debate), seized
this gap in the debate to make a “call.”
Everybody commenced to howl out the
word “Willis” at the top of his voice,
to the astonishment of the few members
of the Opposition present, who, I think,
really had not the remotest idea of what
was happening.
Cohen (later Judge Cohen) preserved
his presence of mind. Seeing that
Thrower, who gave the most artistic in-
dications of being thrown off his balance
by the unexpected noise of his own
friends, was too overcome to proceed
with the address which he had apparently
proposed delivering, Cohen stepped in
and started to address the Clerk him-
self. By this time the die was cast.
Black and Scobie, faithful to their in-
structions, had each seized Willis by one
arm, and were more than two-thirds of
the way which separated his modest seat
in the Chamber from the Speaker’s
throne. For the moment a wild idea of
resisting his occupancy of it by physical
force was evidently contemplated by
some members of the Opposition, but I
had thoughtfully planted around the steps
of the Chair some members of our own
party who by their physical dimensions
and corporeal weight were qualified to
discourage any effort of that kind, and
after a moment it was dropped.
In another moment Willis was in the
Chair, briefly acknowledging the honor
done him. In another moment I was
offering him my congratulations as
Leader of the House, stressing the
unanimity of the call by which he had
been appointed to his exalted position.
In another moment the whole of the
members of the Opposition were back in
their places totally unaware of what had
happened ; utterly unable to believe their
eyes, and preparing for a minor pande-
monium. In another moment I had
moved the adjournment of the House,
which was put and carried, and in yet
another the new Speaker swept off majes-
tically to the Speaker’s room, followed by
the Clerk and the faithful Sergeant at
Arms, thus ending a night unique in the
history of Australian Parliamentary Gov-
ernment.

be given in next week’s Bulletin.!


It is when men and women are their own natural
selves, with their own peculiar powers at the highest
pitch of development, that they are at their best.
They then give untrammelled expression of their own
individuality; they are bold, courageous and success-
ful because they trust themselves.
This is the keynote of the Pelman System for training
the mind and memory and developing the personality.
The Pelman System trains men and women as indi-
viduals. It shows them how to make the most of
themselves, how to make full use of their special
aptitudes; it helps each pupil to define an aim and
it indicates to each the lines along which he or she
can travel to a successful realisation of that aim.
The Pelman System really trains. It teaches certain
principles based on natural laws, but it is primarily
a system of training whereby individual qualities and
attributes are developed so that the Pelmanist can,
in business, in the home (housewives, please note)
and in social life, be sure of himself or herself, so

MEN AND WOMEN FOR 1935
More than 31,000 men and women in Australia and New Zealand have enrolled for the
Pelman Course with the Institute in Melbourne. Below are opinions received recently
from some of them. The relationship between the Institute and its members is a most
happy one, and we could fill a whole “Bulletin” with such letters.
that he will find pleasure in the effort which the
competition of others makes necessary as well as in
the periods of relaxation to which we are all entitled.
Amongst these attributes and qualities are:
Observation
Concentration
Judgment
Decision
Will-Power
Self-Confidence
Social Ease
Presence of Mind
Initiative
Promptness
And a Reliable Memory
These qualities are the base on which steadiness,
serenity, stability and energy rest. They will be as
valuable and as necessary to success and happiness
in 1933 as they have been in the years that have
gone. Pelmanism strengthens them until they
become habitual and are exercised in all the affairs
of life, and so the Pelmanist secures that happiest
of all possessions, a way of life, thought and work
that earns the respect of his associates, makes him
effective in his regular employment and lifts him io
the top of any special occasion that may arise.
Whilst visiting many large centres and
interviewing large numbers of business and
professional men, I have found repeatedly
coming to my aid the benefits of the Pelman
Course. —Boctor.
Keener interest in life and improved
greatly in Self-Confidence, Personality and
Memory. Conducting my social life confi-
dently and more efficiently.—Clerk.
I took up the Course with the main object
of overcoming a reserved nature, which pre-
cluded me from taking part in discussions
of policy and in debates. I have achieved
this object. Also, I find myself rapidly
acquiring a larger circle of friends.- Farmer.
Last month I won a Flying Scholarship
for which there were 216 entrants. I thank
Pelmanism for this success, chiefly because
of the wonderful manner in which it has
increased my self-confidence.—Clerk.
My main object (the desire to overcome
the impediment in my speech) in taking up
the Course has been attained.—Sheep Parmer.
I am amazed at the manner in which these
printed lessons time and again hit upon,
and deal with, what I have always considered
as my own personal and particular problems.
—Engineer.
I am conscious of much greater freedom
in preaching—also of fertility of, ideas. Last
Sunday I preached four times to different
congregations on practically the same sub-
ject with .scarcely any repetition.—Clergy-
man.
Thanks to Pelmanism, I have instituted a
system into the harvesting which worked out
without a hitch, and have taken off a record
crop with less expense per ton, and in a
shorter time than ever I have done before.—
Horticulturist.
It may interest you to know that my
figures for the first quarter this year show
an increase of bl) per cent.—Commercial
Traveller.
I feel physically and mentally alive and
ready for my day’s work. I can find interest
in it now, wlieu I was beginning to think I
had made a mistake.^—Engineer.
... Considerable progress in my conver-
sational efforts, which are now a pleasure
and relaxation instead of an embarrass-
ment. —Assessor.
I am grateful to the Institute for showing
me how to use my mind . . . Pelmauism
is an enemy of fear and ignorance, it is
packed with commonsense and practical
advice and with inspiration to bigger living.
—Clerk.
I wish to express my gratitude to Pel-
manism. I feel entirely remade. My obser-
vation. concentration, personality and, above
all, my memory have improved.—Chemist.
I now have ideals, thoughts and an out-
look which enable me to increase my efforts
towards the goal of honest, honourable and
successful endeavour. —Bank Clerk.
I have enjoyed and appreciated the Pel-man
Course as I have rarely enjoyed anything
before.—Articled Clerk.

PEARLS OF PAPUA
By Commander H* C. Brewster
A really topnotch book for boys—indeed, for anyone who
retains some boyish love of exciting open-air adventure. Pearls
of Papua takes the reader first pearling on the North Australian
grounds and then into a series of excitements while the leading
characters are wandering amidst hostile and friendly tribes
through the heart of Papua. The adventures are not imaginary;
Commander Brewster bases them on life experiences, making
of them a lively narrative, touched with humor. Pearls of Papua
can be heartily recommended as a wholesome, stirring tale that
any boy will joy to have as a gift.
