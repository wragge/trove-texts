A Russian Anthology
-V Russian anthology has drifted into this
country—a collection of translations by
Babelte Deutxcl idl'd Avrnlmi, Yarmolinsky.
Yarmolinsky explains that the book has in
it the choice of a Russian and the choice of
a foreigner. With their fork they tossed
till! mound, .and what the subjective prong
missed was caught by the objective prong. The
starkness that mars Russian prose is absent:
a modern Herman anthology is more naked
than this hook. One has; of course, to make
allowance for the Continental mind. The
norm of decency varies. A coarseness in
England might be a common place in France,
and conversely a mere British smut might
he a Batin prurience.
They begin with Pushkin. As in England
Art was the hirth-mate of nationalism, so
it was horn with patriotism in Russia in the
nineteenth century. Shakspeare raised the
flagon of drama, Pushkin lifted the goblet
of lyricism. Pushkin’s racial memories
must have been sombre enough. Ilis grand-
father was a negro, his grandmother a Ger-
man, liis father a Russian ; a son he was of
the jungle, the pine-forests, the snows, Yet
his poetry reflects none of them. It has the
quiet of greatness. Yarmolinsky complains
that Pushkin’s meaning defies the pursuit of
foreigners, and that it is useless to include
his finest lyrics. Women crossed his path
repeatedly, but it would be hard to say
whether he were the limer or the limed.
He married a wife like the wife of Andrea
del Sarto, and died in a duel defending her
name. He was then only 37. with the cloth
of his genius half-spun. This example is
simple and humble
Here is the long-bided hour, the labor of years Is
accomplished.
Why should this sadness unplumbed secretly weigh
on my heart?
Is it, my work being done, I stand like a- laborer,
useless,
One who has,taken his pay, alien, to unwonted tasks?
Is it the work I regret, the silent companion of
midnight,
Friend of the 'golden-haired Dawn, friend of the
gods of the hearth?
Pushkin flung back the torch to Lermontov,
a wild soul. Tlie locusts ate into liis years
and a duel reft tlie remnant. He was for
a time exiled to the Caucasus, and it was a
happy exile in a land of song. It may be
that he spoke his heart out in this:-
For all I thank Thee, I, the meek remitter;
For passion’s secret torments without end,
The kiss of venom and the tears too bitter,
The vengeful enemy, the slanderous friend,
The spirit’s ardor on the desert squandered,
For every lash of Life’s deceiving thong;
f thank Thee for the wastes where I have wandered,
But heed thou that I need'not thank Thee long!
The desert indeed, poor Berm on toy !
In Fyodor Tyufchcv one finds, curiously
enough, n touch of Alice Meynell. The Rus-
sian moderns owe much to. Tyutchev, who,
like Gray, left only a, slender volume be-
hind him. One stanza here to show his style :
Tlie heart was born dumb; who can sense
Its tremors, recondite and tense.
And who can hear its silent cry?
A thought when spoken is a lie;
Uncovered springs men will, pollute,.
Drink hidden waters and be mute!
Nekrasov was a different matter. He
came to the capital, a stormy, starving little
petrol, and by sheer genius won himself a
place in the sun. He never forgot his youth-
ful sufferings, and his very riches pricked
his soul. His “Who Can Live Happily in
Russia?” is one of the best known of Rus-
sian poems. In the “Salt Song” taken from
it, the little child, the youngest son, refuses
bread that is not salt. The mother flours
if. but the trick is vain. And then :
The bit appears
Again all floured,
And wet with tears,
It is devoured.
The mother said
She’d saved her clear;
Salt was the bread,
How salt the tear!
Then came a period when poetry was
chained to politics by an uneasy fetter. A
few poets like Alexey Tolstoy and Foeth
stood out in revolt. In one sense they.were
right. Art has no frontiers. Yet is it
chameleon and has a color for every nation.
Tolstoy has some tender lyrics—“My Little
Almond-tree” and “A Well and the Cherry-
trees Swaying” bring echoes of the Shrop-
shire Bad. They are pure poetry. Maikov's
“Upon This Wild Headland” brings a Breton
wind and a memory of Loti. And Foeth’s
poem on tlie swallows answers for itself: —
And once again the same quick daring,
And once again the same dark stream ;
Is not the flight our human faring?
Is not this urge our human dream?
His tree, like Housman’s, fruited only at
tlie beginning and at tlie end. He was
happy as few Russians are happy. Tschaikov-
sky has set many of Ills poems to music.
We come now to the three neo-Romanti-
eists who, at first corrupted by European
decadence, finally purged themselves of the
foreign virus and evolved a lusty native style.
These were Balmont, Brusov and the wizard-
Sologub. The delicate Bunin refused the
witches’ apples. Sologub writes poems to
Satan, invoking him as Christians invoke
Christ: —
When heaving on tlie stormy waters,'
I felt my soul begin to sink,
I prayed, “Oh, Father Satan, save me.
Forgive me at Death's utter brink!’’
If the searcher of majesty be overwhelmed
by glory, what fate is in store for the
searcher of iniquity? It is curious to re-
member that Sologub was once a school-
master. Shades of Swinburne and Baude-
laire, he outlusted you ! Balmont’s reputa-
tion, once so great, is waning. Ilis trans-
lations, however, will live. Both he and
Brusov have a way of repeating the last line
and so carrying it on to the next verse. The
Irish poet James Stephens uses the same
device. Bunin fled from the new Russia.
No Soviets for Bunin ! He came to a set-
ting that suited him better, the cobblestones
and lilacs of Paris. There is much of classi-
cism in him. but there is also a note of
patient simplicity that recalls Synge and
Botrel. “Flax” is a lyric of witchlike beauty.
But listen to ibis: —-
I'm a plain girl whose hands are stained with earth.
tie is a fisherman —-he’s gay and keen.
The far white sail is drowning in tlie firth,
Many the seas and rivers he has seen.
The women of the Bosphorus, they say,
Are good-looking. And I, I’m lean and black.
The white sail drowns far out beyond the bay.
It may be that he never will come back.
One of the greatest of the Symbolists is
Ivanov, lie has a consciousness of com-
munal religion. lie finds in Dionysos, a fore-
runner, of Christ. There is something noble
in Ivanov, lie is one of the facets of Russia,
perhaps its purest facet. The whole of
Iranian philosophy is contained in his two
great lines: —
Dying (lie seed will discover (lie self it finds in
the losing ;
That- is, o Nature, thy law; that is thy lesson,
O Man !
Blok cannot be passed over. His emotional-
ism is a lancet that pierces far. “The
Twelve” has been translated into many
tongues. He lashes and Caresses the country
of his love :—-
To welcome pretty Europe we shall spread
And scatter in the tangled space
Of our wide thickets. We shall turn
To you • our alien Asiatic face.
Wc pass over Bely and Gorodetzky and come
to the serene and stately Anna Akhmatova.
One can imagine this woman sitting brood-
ing, almost haughty in her stillness, with
stern eyes under her caved brows. She has
the nobility of Claudel’s women and the sac-
rifice of a Russian woman :—•
Give me comfortless seasons of sickness,
Visitations of wrath and of wrong
On my house; Lord, take child and companion,
And destroy the sweet power of song,
Thus I pray at each matins and vespers,
After these many wearying days,
That tiie stormcloud which broods over Russia
May be changed to a nimbus ablaze.
The editor states that above all lie and his
collaborator have endeavored to make each
translation a poem. Judged by the result it
is well with Deutsch and Yarmolinsky.

“Strange Survivals”
John \Vesley, whose gratuitous adminis-
tration of remedies to the poor was men-
tioned by Fred J. Broomfield (U.P.
4/12/’24), wrote a book on physic which was
so popular that it ran through 36 editions
between 1747 and 1840. His cure for colic
was to ..“hold a Jive puppy constantly on the
belly.” His clinic must have been an in-
teresting place. Similar remedies are 'still
advocated in parts of Australia. A cure for
water blisters recommended to me by a land-
lady in the Northern Rivers 'district
(N.S.W.) . was to burst them by a smart
blow with the Bible. This is akin to the
Malay belief that if verses of the Koran are
soaked in water the fluid becomes a sovereign
specific for rheumatism. As a boy I was
always fed on a diet of fish preparatory to
sitting for exams.-, as fish was believed to
be good brain food, and I was believed to
need it badly. The rationalising modern ex-
planation is that fisl} contain a large propor-
tion of phosphorus; but the idea was pro-
bably similar to the Chinese belief that if
llie Hilo of executed bandits is swallowed it
will make the swallower brave. The ancient
Syrians esteemed fish sacked, and thought
that if they ate them their bodies would
break out in ulcers and their feet and stom-
ach would swell up. Tribes that live mainly
upon fish are careful to treat them with
reverence and respect. The Indians of Pern
gave a selected sardine divine honors and
then ate his brethren. There is a wide-
spread belief in Australia that mirrors and
steel objects attract lightning, especially if
they are moved, and good housewives are
careful to cover up looking-glasses and close
cutlery-drawers on the approach of a storm.
In China when a death occurs mirrors are
covered up because the reflection of the de-
ceased’s ghost turns into an abiding spirit
: —and the spirits of the departed in China
are always malignant. A girl with a very
straight shingle told me the other day that
rice pudding and bread crusts are valuable
-specifics for promoting curly hair. There does
not seem to be any connection between the
remedy and the disease here as there is in
the practice of Javanese theatrical proprie-
tors of giving their dancing-girls small earth-
worms to eat when their voices become
hoarse. These earthworms emit a shrill,
rattling cry like an alarm-clock, which is
quite as close to singing as the Javanese
dancing-girl ever gets. I don’t know -whether
the modern child, when he loses a marble,
throws another one after it in the belief
that the two will be found together; but
this was the accepted ritual of my child-
hood. and was frequently successful. A
small boy told me recently that to put your
hat on the road and walk round it three
times brought good luck, but another boy
told me that in his district it was an in-
fallible means of enraging a Chinaman.
Neither of them was clear as to whether the
direction of the procession should be widder-
sliim or deiseal, though this is usually con-
sidered most important. For instance, the
devout but ill-instructed pilgrim of antiquity
who went round the temple of Borobudur in
Java in a direction against the course of the
sun simply unwound his chain of merit.
Other strange survivals with a hoary an-
cestry are the beliefs that peacocks’ feathers
and walking under ladders bring ill-luck;
but the most startling example I have ever
come across was in Ascot (Eng.), near the
famous racecourse. After a birth had taken
place I was invited into the kitchen of the
house in which I was staying. Half a dozen
old wives.of the village looked on while the
midwife solemnly placed the placenta on the
fire. The number of explosions it emitted
in the process of immolation indicated the
number of additional children the new-made
father was to have. The truth or otherwise
of the augury has not yet been proven. I
am assured by an old lady who has helped
to bring babies into the world in most of
the backblpcks regions of Queensland and
N. S. Wales that the practice is still observed
m this country. In Malaya the afterbirth
is buried and a tree planted over it. The
tree becomes the elder brother of the child,
and their destinies are inseparably linked.

Restocking, Rejointing and Rebolting
Gun. —This work must not be confused with
the “tightening” usually applied to loose actions,
which is generally nothing more than a ruinous
hammering of the lumps or body of the gun.
These so-called Repairs are a source of constant
danger to the man who shoots. Guns “tight-
ened ’ by the “Hammer Method” are generally
found, after firing a few hundred cartridges, to
be worse than before. By our method any loose
Gun can be made as sound and tight at the
Breech as when issued by the Maker. We use
iJoint Tins and Bolts made only from the
Highest-grade Crucible Steel.
Stock Repairing is carried out without the
use of plates, or disfiguring the Stock in any
way. The Repair, in addition to its durability,
is usually quite invisible, even when the Stock
is completely broken in two places. Our method
leaves the Gun with precisely the same feel
and balance. This is readily recognised as a
most important matter to shooters who have
become accustomed to their Guns.

All our Repairs are guaranteed, but in order
to get the benefit of our guarantee sufficient of
the Gun must be sent for us to test the work.
For instance, if new Strikers are required,
unless the whole Gun is sent we cannot guaran-
tee proper firing, although the Guarantee would
hold against the breakage of the Strikers.
Remember, it is nearly always necessary to send
more than the broken sample Avhen wanting one
“to match,” for obviously the part would not
have broken had it been correct, and an
incorrect model is not a proper model for us to
work from. The Safest and Best Way is to
send the Whole Gun.
Guns for Repairs should be sent carefully
Packed, by Parcel Post or Passenger Train,
freight paid, with a letter of advice stating how
the Gun has been forwarded, and what Repairs
are needed.

For Radio Service,
252 YORK STREET, SYDNEY.
One of our most invincible relics is tlie tabu
on women. In that field the custom of the
Australian aboriginal and the conventions of
his white conqueror meet on common ground,
as I had very clearly brought home a little
while back when I had occasion to visit a
cemetery in the environs of Sydney. The
’bus that took me to the cemetery was full
of women, in full or half mourning, with
laps and baskets loaded with flowers. The
cemetery when we got there was dotted with
little groups arranging flowers in bottles, plant-
ing out seedlings and putting up pitiful little
tributes of stones and shells to their departed
relatives; and all the grave-tenders were
women. Presently a funeral arrived—a
dark, moving shadow across that hill of glit-
tering sand and marble. It stopped, and,
headed by a clergyman, the coffin-bearers
moved towards a new grave, followed by a
little, black-coated procession. All the
mourners were men. In Siberia I noticed
how women were not regarded as fit even to
worship—the sexes were segregated in the
churches and the women’s enclosure was the
inferior. In Southern India wives believe
that to tell their husband’s name or to pro-
nounce it even in a dream would bring him
to an untimely end; and all races have re-
garded women at certain periods to have pes-
tilential powers. Another survival which I
observed at a confirmation ceremony in a Syd-
ney suburban church was that the boys went
hatless while the girls had white jiapkins,
like a nurse’s headgear, pinned round their
heads. This may have something to do with
the old belief that the head of a man was
so sacred that nothing must be put above
it; that a hand laid on it was blasphemy,
and that even to walk on a floor above it
was an insult. Some races built one-
storeyed houses in observance of this belief,
and when the Sultan of Djokja, in Java,
was presented with a replica of London Lord
Mayor’s coach he could not use it because
the driver’s seat was higher than his own.
Women, having no souls, were not affected by
this tabuj in fact, it was essential for them
to confess their inferiority by being covered
on occasions of religious ceremony.
John Wesley’s chief gift to Cornwall was
the little stone boxes called churches. The
sexton’s wife at one of these told me that
the “strawberry marks” wdiich sometimes dis-
figure babies and remain with them through
life were due to the mother during her wait-
ing time craving, like the woman in Grimm’s
fairy tale of Rapunzel, for some fruit that
was out of season. In the child’s after-life
these birthmarks always became more dark
and conspicuous when the fruit in question
was ripe. Coming nearer home, the Malays
believe that if a woman in child-bed is denied
any food she asks for the result will be
disastrous to the unborn child, and on this
account they will even give her pork.
In these rambling notes. I have described
a few of the trilobites I have myself col-
lected from local strata. A symposium on
the subject would, I expect, give very in-
teresting results.

The Nerli Portrait of R.L.S.
The cabled news from America of the
sale by auction for 1500 dollars of the
original MS. of R. L. Stevenson’s memorable
verses, “Requiem,” recalls the presence in
Sydney of another unique Stevenson item
which it is more than likely will also find
its way to America. This is the painting
Known as the Nerli portrait. It was painted
in 1892 at Yailima by Count Nerli, an Italian
artist who for some time lived in Maoriland.
At the time Stevenson was convalescing
from one of his frequent attacks of sickness;
and the portrait suggests it. Nevertheless,
he was characteristically cheerful under the
circumstances, and has left as a record of
the incident some amusing verses :—-
He took a thraw to paint mysel’, he painted late
and early ;
Oh, wow! the many a yawn I’ve yawned in the
beard of Mr. Nerli!
Oh, will he paint me the way I want, as bonny as
a girlie,
Or will he paint me an ugly tyke, apd be damned 1o
Mr. Nerli?
Mrs. Stevenson, in a letter to her friend
ixird Guthrie, describes the visit of the
painter and the uncomfortable business the
wont was. She says the conditions were
trying, the heat being almost unbearable, be-
cause the artist insisted on the doors and
windows being closed to avoid cross-lights.
Beads of perspiration trickled down Steven-
son’s face. It was a question who suffered
more, he or Nerli, in that Turkish bath.
Mrs. Stevenson’s most acute observation,
however, is that she was of the opinion that
Nerli never forgot he was painting the
author of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
Now, of the three known portraits from
life of R.L.S.—the one under review, the
arresting full-length by Sargent, and a pencil
drawing by Percy Spence—it is the first
which is the least pleasing, the least popular.
The reason is that Stevenson was at the
time a very sick man. Nerli drew him as
he was, rather unkempt, with that sickly
uncertain look of the invalid just recovering.
But Mrs. Stevenson shows a keen critical
sense in supposing that ever present in the
artist’s mind was the fact that before him
was the creator of Jekyll and Hyde. That
was the Stevenson he painted, not the roman-
tic exile, the wit, the artist. Therein lies
the difference between this particular portrait
and the Sargent and the numerous sketches
and photographic studies which have given
to the world the Stevenson it wanted, rather
than the Stevenson who was. The Nerli
work might easily have been made more
attractive, been more idealised. It is doubt-
ful whether, under such conditions, it could
have been as true, as revealing as it is. The
colors are rich, the expression well caught,
subtle; the effect compelling. What matter
if it be not altogether a pretty, a pleasing
portrait ?
The history of the painting and its prob-
able future are of interest at this juncture,
in view of the eager demand for Stevenson-
iana in America and England. Nerli came
to Sydney and the portrait passed into the
hands of Messrs. Angus and Robertson. It
was bought by the late Professor Anderson
Stuart. At his death, a year or two ago, it
was offered for sale to the trustees of the
Art Gallery. They would not buy. It then
became the property of a Sydney art collec-
tor. It is not improbable that in time this
portrait of one of tlie greatest literary figures
of our time, of close personal association
with our own country, will pass beyond our
possessing to a country where such tilings
are appreciated. One realises the difficulties
with which the Sydney National Gallery has
to contend. With an income one speaks of
in lowered tones when compared with that
enjoyed by the Melbourne Gallery, the
trustees have to look twice —should look,
rather —at every pound they propose to
spend. But there is ample proof that, in
regard to several recent purchases in particu-
lar, there has been unwise extravagance. The
unwisdom becomes more evident when we
think of the Nerli portrait being refused for
what, in the light of the present market
prices of Stevenson items, is merely a nomi-
nal figure.
RAYMOND BREMIS.
From Fig-leaf to Lip-stick
In the discussion of nose-rings, ear-rings,
anklets, rouge and eyebrow pencils, Mr.
Lester Way appears to be confident that they
all have their origin in female vice, although
history shows that, until comparatively re-
cent times, the lordly sex set the pace in the
use not only of adornments, but of gay-
colored and fantastic garments. Even at
the present day, among uncivilised races, this
is generally the case. And among civil-
ised races man wears, when the glass is in
the region of 100 degrees, a 12-guinea suit
and a starched collar, with shirt and under-
garments to match, when he could be far
more comfortably dressed in a collar-less
flannel shirt and flannel pants at a total cost
of less than £3. Is it Fashion? Or because
he wishes to be as expensively dressed as
other men, or more so, if possible? Or does
he so dress to bewitch and attract the other
sex?
Why do plants expand their flowers and
diffuse their perfumes in the Spring? Why
do the birds display their most brilliant
plumage and the animals their sleekest ap-
pearance? Is it sexual immorality ?_ If
woman adorns herself, as she considers
(rightly or wrongly) to look her best, and
Mr. Way says she is either innocently or
otherwise copying vice, then all Nature is
immoral.
Every virtue if sufficiently exaggerated be-
comes a vice. Has not Mr. Way from this
concluded that virtue is vice? The first
natural law is preservation of species, and
to obey this law every species displays all
the attractions it possesses as a means to
perpetuate the race. Self-preservation is
the first clause of the above law, and induces
individuals of a species to try to be the most
attractive members of that species. All
moral laws originate from Nature’s law of
preservation of species. Trying to look one’s
best is tending to fulfil this law, and. is
neither innocently nor knowingly copying
vice, but is obeying Nature’s command. Con-
sequently it is a virtue. But because this
virtue can be exaggerated into vice, it does
not follow that it copies vice. The demi-
monde does not initiate the new fashions,
but, being professionally interested, is early
in adopting them. The old pirates had the
fastest ships they could get hold of; and
the merchants, in order to escape from their
depredations, also built their ships for speed,
as far as cargo space would allow. But their
motives were very different.
Carlyle had something to say on this sub-
ject in “Sartor Resartus” :
The first purpose of clothes was not warmth or
decency, but ornament.... Nay, among wild people
we find tattooing and painting even prior to clothes.
The first spiritual want of a barbarous man is
decoration.... Clothes too, which began in foolishest
love of ornament, what have they not become!
Increased security and pleasurable heat soon fol-
lowed : but what of these ? Modesty, as yet a stranger
to the anthropophagous bosom, arose there mysteri-
ously under Clothes ; a mystic grove-encircled shrine
for the Holy in man. Clothes gave us individuality,
distinctions, social polity; Clothes have made Men
o? us; they are threatening to make Clothes-screens
of u 5.... Neither shall thou prate even to thy own
heart of “those secrets known to all.” Is not
Shame the soil of all Virtue, of all good marine re,
and good morals? Like other plants, Virtue will
not grow unless its root be hidden, buried from the
eye of the sun. Let the sun shine on it, nay, do
but look at it privily thyself, the root withers, and
no flower will glad thee. O my Friends, when we
view the fair clustering flowers, that over-wreathe,
for example, the marriage-bower, and encircle man's
life with the fragrance and hues of Heaven, what
hand will not smite the foul plunderer that grabs
them up by the roots, and, with grinning, grunting
satisfaction, shows us the dung they flourish in!
WILLIAM CLOWES.
Judges and Lawyers of Yesterday
The Judges of Great Britain, dead and
living, have furnished material for numerous
volumes quite outside the covers of Law
Reports, but the Judiciary of Australia has
had little publicity beyond those tomes and
the columns of the press. Philip A. Jacobs,
of the Victorian Bar, has written a bro-
chure, for it can scarcely claim the import-
ance of a book, that does something to fill
the vacant space, at least with regard to
the Bench of his own State, and, incidentally,
the High Court of the Commonwealth.
“These few pages,” he remarks in Judges
of Yesterday (Robertson and Mullens),
“may serve to awaken some memories of
their dispositions and idiosyncrasies.”
Of the late Samuel Griffith, first Federal
Chief Justice, lie speaks, as he needs must,
in terms of high appreciation. In the begin-
ning of Griffith’s career in Queensland, a
prisoner having been convicted of murder,
an application was made to Justice Lut-
wyche to state a case on a point of law for
the opinion of the Full Court. In the course
of the argument the Judge is reported to
have said: “Having some tenderness, per-
haps, for the inexperience of the three
gentlemen defending the prisoner, I said I
would take a note of the objection raised
and I did so.” One of the three “inexperi-
enced gentlemen” was Griffith. He was a
man who might be described as having tal-
ent enough to succeed without industry, and
industry enough to succeed without talent.
When preparing the Queensland criminal
code he considered it necessary to investi-
gate the law of Italy, and for that purpose
made a study of Italian, and subsequently,
as relaxation in his hours of leisure, he
translated Dante into excellent English.
John Madden, late Chief Justice of Vic-
toria, was another “diligent apprentice” with
an extensive range of knowledge that made
him conspicuously “good on facts.” He
rather loved to air his rhetoric and adorn it
with florid phrases. “A facile and fairly
resourceful liar” is quite an elegant descrip-
tion of what in the Backblocks would be put
more bluntly. Of Justice Holroyd it is said
that a nice point of law was to him what a
beautiful picture is to an artist. “In think-
ing of him,” says the author, “one recalls
Baron Parke, who explained to his wife
that he was kept late for dinner by counsel
who had been arguing a ‘beautiful de-
murrer.’ ” He discouraged all technicalities.
Objection was raised to the admission of an
affidavit on the ground that it did not show
on whose behalf it had been filed. His
Honor took up his pen and supplied the de-
fect ; then looking up said, with a smile, “I
think it is all right now.” As a court
official remarked, “Holroyd, J., was a hot
’un, but a honest ’un.” Justice a’Beckett
came of a legal family and had an ancestry
traced to Norman lines, a fact which did not
save him from living in his young days on
such crumbs of the law as court reporting.
As a Judge he had a habit of interrupting
counsel and interposing questions till he got
to the marrow of the case—“a veritable
stripping away of embroidery.” The jest
of a wit in a Chancery suit, that “The estate
will be distributed in the usual way—among
the solicitors,” had no application to him.
To economise costs was a fundamental prin-
ciple in his court. He shared with Lord
Chief Justice Coleridge of England the habit
of seeming to sleep during the course of a
hearing. When he regarded a matter as
trumpery he did not even make a pretence of
interest. In one such case the unsuccessful
party applied for a new trial and found
that “the most conspicuous thing upon the
pages of the judicial notebook” was “a sketch
by him of a cat with an elaborate pair of
whiskers.”
“In the category of strong Judges Mr.
Justice Hodges may fairly be included.” His
frame of mind was severely logical and he
pressed both facts and law to their legiti-
mate conclusion, tempering its severity by
occasional leniency as to costs. lie was one
of that class of Judge who delight in assum-
ing a childlike ignorance. A witness in
court said that someone had been out waltz-
ing with his “donah.” “What is a ‘donah’?”
he asked. Justice Hood would have been a
keen competitor against Judge Backhouse,
of a less exalted jurisdiction in N. S. Wales,
in the expedition with which he carried out
his duties, and earned the sobriquet of the
“lightning Judge.” Nevertheless his judg-
ments based on commonsense with a due
regard to law were admittedly sound. When
a barrister he was asked if he were serious
in contending that the law was to a cer-
tain effect. “Your Honor,” was the reply,
“it is for ‘seriously contending’ I am paid.”
One of the most attractive chapters is on
“Limbs of the Law.” Whether the profes-
sion takes itself more seriously to-day than
it did yesterday, or whether the pressure of
work has so burdened things that there is
no leisure for the indulgence of wit and
humor, the fact' remains that most of our
legal quips are drawn from the past. “Learn-
ing, indeed, grows.” the author remarks,
“but humor lingers.” The old-day freedom
in the courts has gone, or nearly so. Could
this happen to-day? “Come, madam,” said
counsel, “you must have property of some
kind.” Witness (not quite a Venus of
Milo) : “My face is my fortune. m
assets!” roared the Judge. Summons
missed.” “Where, in these times, the
author asks, “shall we look for an lieland,
an Aspinall, a McDermott, a Purves, a
Madden, or a Duffy?” Of this group of wits
some passed to high office, some went , down
that avenue where prosperity lay all u me
background. I came into touch in the days
°f my youth with one of the number, that
quaint old Irish gentleman who in his day,
when the centre of wealth m \ ictoria was
its goldfields, was known as the great
man, shure”—-Townsend McDermott once
Solicitor-General of the then colony, lie
was a notable figure as he passed down the
main street of the Golden City where lay his
principal practice, oblivious of men, absorbed
in the interest of an impending case, mutter-
ing to himself. With a practice worth at
least £4OOO a year, with briefs marked up
to 1400 guineas and frequently to the thou-
nd when such sums counted. for more than
they do to-day, he led in all important min-
ing cases. Years afterwards I sat with the
old man outside the door of a firm of solici-
tors. We were both there on business. His,
he told me, was to exercise his last remain-
ing office of Commissioner for taking affi-
davits. He had no chambers; wife dead,
children scattered, he stood a lpnely,
poverty-stricken man, waiting at door the
petty fees to be earned from those who once
had marked his briefs. I noticed in him
just a touch of the old arrogance and im-
patience as time went on and still we waited.
He pulled out his watch: “Tut-tut, ten
minutes late! Do ye know, young man,
punctuality is the courtesy of kings! Faith,
there’s little of it nowadays!” Not long
afterwards he died suddenly from heart
failure, and doubtless found a King who did
not lack in courtesy.

A Satchel of Books
Ecoins’ Entertainers , by Christopher Druee (John
Lane). The Eceles of Mr. Druce’s novel was the
manager of a seaside troupe. For the portion of
the year, some seven months, when he retired from
the business and lived, in Hampstead, he winnowed
out the grain of the summer harvest, put together
the experiences of character and events he had
acquired, and embodied them in this entertaining
volume.
The Double Life of Janet Ashby, by C. H. Le
Bosquet (John Lane). Miss Ashby, who subsequently
became Mrs. Spaulding, started life on the feminine
side of sex, but later on, under the circumstances set
out in this veracious narrative, she went over the
border line and became male. The book may be
described in the old-fashioned phrase as a “quaint
conceit,” and its object of good sales and comforting
royalties may be attained by thus tickling the
sense of curiosity.
The Golden Journey of Mr. Paradyne, by W. J.
Locke (John Lane). A prosperous K.O. of London is
lured out of his study by the bewitching music of a
flageolet-playing stranger. He wakes up in a gipsy
caravan in France. His wife refuses to believe the
cabled explanation of his absence. “The dawn found
him, with the shining eyes of one awakened to Life’s
promise, jogging south on an irrevocable way, never,
in this life, to retrace his steps.” Locke at lus
slickest and worst. Only a really successful author
could afford to tell a yarn so badly. Marcia Lane
Foster has lavished considerable art on the illumina-
tions, and the publisher has turned out an elegant
volume; but the whole thing can be read m ten
minutes- —and forgotten in two.

Oiling Your Ford
Frankly, you can’t do it properly
without STEWART Help.
Why are the Ford people so emphatic in urging
strict adherence to their oiling instructions?
You know it is because experience has taught them that
upon proper lubrication, more than anything else, does
the smooth-running and long life of the car depend.
Experts unhesitatingly state that quite 80 per cent, of all
motor troubles result from faulty lubrication. Applying
the right kind of oil at the right time ensures minimum
wearing of parts, smooth running, less trouble and lower
running expenses. Haphazard methods of oiling are
never worth the risk. Fifty chances to one, if you do
it by guess-work, you’ll pay dearly before long.
The car-makers with all the advantages of years of
experience tell you to lubricate certain parts at certain
mileages.
To carry out these very vital instructions the help of a
Stewart Ford Oiling System Speedometer is absolutely
indispensable. It is the one sure means of keeping you
to the path of proper lubrication ALWAYS.
The manufacturers of the world-famous Stewart Magnetic
Speedometer designed this instrument because they
realised how difficult it is even with the ordinary mileage
indicator to keep a thorough watch on lubrication.
In addition to indicating speed and recording mileage,
this Patented Stewart Oiling System Speedometer tells
just when and where to oil or grease the diffirent parts
of the Ford Car.
This is how it does its work: In the total register of this
latest Stewart Speedometer are various colored dials
which turn up at intervals and automatically warn the
driver that some part requires oil or grease; a reference
to the corresponding color on the metal chart suspended
from the instrument tells what the part is.
A lubrication chart is also supplied in pocket-book form
with each Speedometer. The booklet gives hints con-
cerning lubrication, and pages for recording tyre and
petrol expenses.
Price complete, £4/5/-
The Stewart Oiling System Speedometer
eliminates guess-work, saves uncertainty and
worry, and makes memorising unnecessary.

There is a beauty in your voice
Like that a child of seven
Hears in a dream when the stars rejoice
At the gate of Heaven.
There is a hope when you are near
That none may take away;
And the words of the hope are too dear
For the tongue to say.
There is a magic in your touch
Like the magic of a prayer

Brings joy unaware.

That is sweet as the dawn on the sea—
Oh, 1 stand in the midst of Paradise.

I Saw Three Maidens.
I saw three maidens yesternight
Stand by the river’s brim,
Three maidens robed in foamy white,
Silent and sweet and slim.
In the star glow
Their gowns of snow
Billowed upon the grass;
And through the air
A fragrance rare
On light winds seemed to pass.
Above the river’s rippled face
They swayed and gently bent.
Watching the wavering forms of grace
Within the mirror pent;
I feared to cross
The paths of moss
Best they perchance should hear
My footsteps fall
To break the thrall,
And rift the vision clear.
Nay! do not tell me that you know
My maidens of the. night.
That by the river still they grow— ■
Three hawthorns in the light.
I still must think
That to the brink
Of that dim shadowy stream
Came, angel-wise,
From out the skies
Three sprites to rest and dream.
In stress of gentle vanity
Remembered long ago.
They sought their images to see
Held in the rippled flow 7.
High in the air
A starry stair
Hung from the jealous skies
To lead them back
The long moon-track
Hid from my seeking eyes.

Summer.
I.
Young Summer, splendid as a bronze, is here
And all the soft-toned moments of the
Spring—
A rosary of fair remembering—
Have vanished. In the fiery atmosphere,
Clean-cut and sharply-etched, flawless and
clear
Is every distant object, each small thing.
The parrakeets flash by on emerald wing:
The pools ai'e dry, the grass grows parched
and sere.
Summer is here clothed in her shining mail.
O’er hill and dale have sped her restless
feet —
An Amazon with ardent glance and bold.
See, at her touch the last pink lilies pale!
The w 7 est -wind spreads its wings of radiant
heat,
Summer flamboyant wears her living gold.

And yet a soft breath sometimes fills the air
Till in the garden, through the moist still
noon.
Cinnamon, amber, saffron and maroon—
Like eastern maidens who have wandered
• there —
Spread out their veils of color everywhere
In canna bloom ; and with the night wind’s
tune
There slowly wakes beneath the tropic
moon
Some waxen blossom cloying as despair.
Out of the depths of the dark scrub may
glide
A jade-green serpent w’ith strange sun-
bright eyes,
While creeping from the distant harbor bars
The heat fogs lift their clouds above the
tide —
Warm clouds as soft as carded -wool that
rise
Dimming the yellow beauty of the stars.

THURSDAY, JANUARY 1, 1925.
ENTER 1925.
Ten years ago the world, stunned with its
first plunge into the agonies of modern war,
was tuning itself to hymns of hate and plan-
ning means of greater destruction. Civilisa-
tion was in eclipse, and the whole existence
of those who had the kindliest outlook on the
world was staked upon finding a means of
beating the new barbarism to its knees. The
year 1925 opens with fairer prospects. Peace,
neither very stable nor up to the better
samples known in former years, is almost
general. Russia still shudders like a rest-
ing volcano; there are plottings and counter-
plottings in most of the little States which
the war created; doubt and bickering and
smouldering revolt are the features of all
the Mohammedan countries; China is un-
settled and suffering from the movements of
privately-owned armies which seem to be
working towards no definite national object;
Japan is hurt and unhappy; India is stum-
bling blindly along dangerous paths; Spain
is under a military despotism which is not
strong enough to prevent her soldiers run-
ning before their foes; Italy bends to the
autocratic rule of a single will, with mines
ready to explode the moment that will weak-
ens or is broken. But there are signs that
England, France and even Germany are set-
tling down to the new order, and that many
of the battle scars are healing. It is possible
to go farther than this and say that most
of the world’s pressing problems are being
faced —not tackled in a serious and deter-
infned way, but at least acknowledged as prob -
lems and brought out into the full light of
discussion.
* * * *
World economy would seem to be the great
science of the future. For ages men have sought
to accumulate wealth for the benefit of their
children; and in many countries the perma-
nent importance of the family was secured
by this means. Nations, too, have mapped
out their future and accumulated resources
of one kind and another which have assured
the continuance of their plans. Now the
idea must be extended to the world at large.
The wealth accumulated as a family heritage
may easily be lost through the failure of the
supply of those things from which income
is derived; and t’m great machinery devised
to give a nation industrial prosperity might
rust in idleness if the operating power or
the raw material were no longer obtainable.
The huge income derived from the Ford cars
could be wiped out in a year by the failure
of petrol supplies; and the greatest news-
papers in the world could be reduced to
pamphlets if the pulp for paper-making sud-
denly gave out. Yet the present lavish ex-
penditure of raw material goes on without
reference to the future. The energy of man-
kind is such that it produces a good deal
more in many directions that the world
needs. Tens of thousands of articles which
went to swell the recent Christmas display
in the shops were far beyond the needs and
appreciation of the buyers; and some of
these things, representing sheer economic
waste, made large inroads on the available
supplies. The finer taste of a better-trained
future may hunger for the very materials
that have been wasted to-day. There is no
co-ordination between supply and price. The
world may have but one forest of a particu-
lar kind of timber, yet unless there is an
extreme popular demand for it, that timber
will be sold, not according to its rarity, but
according to the ease or difficulty with which
it can be milled and shipped away. Even
things that seem far more unlikely to be
exhausted than timber may be exhausted.
The emerald is to-day one of the really pre-
cious stones, and fine specimens bring more
than diamonds of equal size and quality; for
the world has practically run out of emeralds.
The South American Spaniards exploited the
mines and robbed the natives of their trea-
sures until Europe looked upon the green
stones as comparatively plentiful. To-day
nearly all the fine emeralds which come into
the market are taken from old ornaments.
Where are the pearls for which the British
seas were once famous? We hear nothing
of them after the Roman period. Evidently
the last lonely oyster containing anything
of value was dredged from the sea-bed. In
many directions Nature does not replenish
things as fast as man uses them; in many
more directions Nature does not replenish
things at all, or does so at such a slow rate
that they cannot again be available for mil-
lions of years. It is in view of these facts
that world economy should be practised and
the rights of the,future regarded.
* * * *
There is probably no other country which
so lightly regards the rights of the future as
our own Australia. To tear something out
of the continent and pass it over to others
for its present cash value has become the
ruling principle. After nearly a century and
a half of white settlement, the year
1925 finds us still largely hewers of wood
and drawers of water for other peoples, finds
us with a thin population badly distributed
and with definite outside dangers which we
can make but poor preparation to face. It
finds us rejoicing over good harvests and
high prices for some raw materials, but it
does not find us thinking nationally or laying
sound foundations for a great future. To
exploit a distant market is still regarded as
of more value than to create a home market.
We cry aloud for population, but offer very
little proof of stable nationhood to the people
who might make good citizens of our country.
The productions of a country are its sign
to the outer world of its standard of civilisa-
tion and place among the nations. The
country of industrial progress is likely to be
the country of intellectual progress also.
The districts of literary production in the
United States are New England, the district
around Chicago and the State of Pennsyl-
vania. New York, the mere clearing-house,
writes little that is worth while; and the
South and West are almost barren of cul-
ture. So if literary production be a test of
intellectual life—and it is probably the best
test —the intellect of America is grouped
around her_ centres of manufacture. Pos-
sibly the thing works both ways. The intel-
lectual progress may produce the industrial
progress; and an intellectual awakening in
Australia which would set the thinking to
a national tune might be the surest way of
setting the wheels spinning also. But the
oustanding fact of the New Year 1925 is
that Australia is still in the eyes of a large
section of its people a mass of varie-
gated material which we are engaged in the
business of tearing to pieces and exporting,
only the waste products being thrown aside
to make a home and a means of livelihood for
the future nation.
“SCAB!”
Used opprobriously, a workman who does not
belong to, or will not join, or act with a union;
one who takes the place of a striker ; a strike-
breaker.”—Office Dictionary.
It is a definition that would be accepted by
British and American unionists, but it has
become pathetically inadequate in this coun-
try. As employed by the “advanced” gentry,
“scab” has come to mean any laboring (or
Labor) person who, in a matter concerning
his organisation, directly or indirectly, does
not agree with or submit to a union boss or
ruling clique. A story is told of Murphy,
the organiser, who wanted to get up a strike
in the Gravel-shifters’ Union and met with
annoying opposition at the union meeting
summoned for the purpose. “Let’s have a
ballot,” said a voice from the back. “Right
you are,” replied Murphy, “we’ll have a
ballot here and now. ‘Scabs’ to the left;
unionists to the right.” But there are divers
offences against bossism for which unionists
may be branded as “scabs.” The hateful
term has been applied to pieceworkers who
earned more than the lazy and inefficient,
and to Government artisans who received
bonuses for good work. It has been fastened
to seamen who took jobs on a Government
steamer regardless of the ukase that the
union officials (not the ship’s officers, as
everywhere else in the world) would select
the crew. When the vessel returned to port
these seamen were placed on the unemployed
list and deprived of all union privileges;
and the Government, their employer, let it
be done.
* * * *
There was a strike in a Sydney factory
against the statutory 48-hour working week.
The order was not generally obeyed, and
presently some of the strikers, with the
union’s permission, went to work in a rival
factory where the loathed 48 hours were in
force. But unionists who remained on the
job (and, incidentally, earned more money
than the others referred to) received the
customary designation. When the Sydney
waterfront strike was extended to Adelaide,
Government railwaymen refused to handle
mails from a British steamer, and Govern-
ment harbor employees declined to man a
launch that was to take a member of the
Government House staff alongside the
steamer. Not, apparently, because they
wanted to mutiny, but because they were
afraid of being called “scabs.” In the argot
of the Seamen’s Union, the Westralian
Labor Ministers were “scabs” when they re-
fused to join in Walsh’s plans for holding
up the port of Fremantle, the idea being that
the Government would thus get a pretext
for paying firemen employed on State vessels
£7, and ordinary seamen £6 10s., for a week
of 48 hours, with 13 holidays per annum and
overtime at 3s. 9d. per hour; and they were
“scabs” again when they sent police to ,tho
wharf to protect passengers who had been
forcibly prevented by Walsh’s pickets from
boarding an Orient liner. And when union
lumpers on strike against overseas shipping
companies worked steamers which had been
declared “black” by Walsh’s union as a
manoeuvre in its quarrel with the State Labor
Government, but which did not come under
their own organisation’s ban, they too became
“scabs.” These lumpers, as it happens,
were strong enough to protect themselves,
but in most cases to be branded as a “scab”
is to be sentenced to bitter poverty and vari-
ous forms of persecution which may last a
lifetime. And some of the union papers
have taken to publishing the names of wage-
earners who offend the “heads”—usually by
laboring in their vocation for legally-fixed
rates of wages—which proceeding is an in-
citement to violent assaults on the black-
listed men and to the more refined cruel-
ties of which women and children are the
victims.
* » * *
The power of condemning peaceful and
industrious citizens to scabbery has become
the most dangerous weapon in the union
boss’s armory. Australia having reached
the position where a man may not earn
his bread without the union’s sanction, the
word “scab” has acquired something of the
terrible significance that “heretic” had in
the .time of the Inquisition and “hors la lot”
during the French Revolution. If the Com-
monwealth Arbitration Court is to survive
it will have to be equipped with an award-
enforcing branch on the lines of the N. 8.
Wales Legal Aid Department, but with far
greater powers: an Arbitration Aid Depart-
ment it might be called. Such a department,
in addition to initiating proceedings for
breaches of awards when the facts are fur-
nished by an aggrieved party (as things are,
the aggrieved party rarely takes legal action,
preferring to let the matter go, or to call
a strike), might be empowered to prosecute
anv person or persons who brand a unionist
as a “scab” with the object of preventing him
taking work or continuing in the performance
of duties, and the enjoyment of rights which
the Law supposes him to have, under condi-
tions fixed by the Court. The penalties
should be substantial enough to make the
offence unfashionable. If the moderate-
minded unionist had some such protection
against ruffians who hold the threat of ex-
communication over his head, there would be
a lasting slump in “sympathetic” and “irri-
tation” strikes, among other results bene-
ficial to the individual and the community—•
many, if not most, of the participants in
these strikes are dragged in against
their will. But “Nationalist” Govern-
ments never take up the cudgels for the
immediate sufferers from the tyranny of
union bosses, although they talk a lot, and
try to salve their consciences, on occasion,
with grants of public money. Whether the
victim is an industrious pieceworker, or a
too competent Government laborer, or a sea-
man who has resisted the job-control policy,
or a factory-hand who kept on working
under a legal agreement which his union vio-
lated, or a wharfie who toiled when the
submarine war was at its worst and the
Waterside Workers’ Federation folded its
arms, or a returned soldier who was pro-
mised preference on the waterfront and
assured that it was embodied in two Acts
of Parliament, one State and the other
Federal. “Nationalist” Governments invari-
ably let him down.
THE BUILDER OF AN AUSTRALIAN
OUTPOST.
In the pre-war days of the Royal Engineers
(volunteer section) I helped to waggle the
searchlight on Blakang Mati. Blakang Mati
(“After Death”) is one of the innumerable
low islands composing the archipelago of Sin-
gapore, and was a rendezvous for all the
ghosts of the neighboring settlement. We
didn’t do much harm with our death-ray, be-
yond frightening a late-returning Malay
fisherman out of his koleh occasionally; the
rest of our warlike activities consisted in
tramping to and fro on the parade-ground
over a mob of disrespectful youngsters of
every Asiatic race, watching a bored English
officer draw on a blackboard plans and speci-
fications of military bridges based on the
practice of Cesar’s Commentaries,. and
sallying forth into the jungle at long inter-
vals to put his principles into effect. They
were halcyon days, when the Anglo-Japanese
Alliance brooded over Asia, and Germany
was a vulgar upstart, all sound and fury,
but of no real importance.. The jolly little
brown men whose emblem is the Rising Sun
had pledged themselves to help us with an
army of 300,000 if Russia invaded India ; and
to make insurance doubly sure we had an
agreement with the Russian that he
do anything of the sort. t ' nlic l
The war upset all those arrangem M _
justified more than ever the wisdom or t j 1(?
ford Raffles’s choice of Singapore
“next step” after India in Britain s ®
march. It is curious how consistently .
Foreign Offices are in their judgments ,
subordinates’ actions. “You have •' i nm i
the cession of Hongkong, a barren .
with hardly a house upon it. It seem
ous that Hongkong will not be _ the
of trade any more than Macao is, . "
Lord Palmerston in 1841 to
Elliot, the British Commissioner m Liana,
and the British East India Co. was equauy
annoyed with Raffles for his unauthor
occupation of Singapore in 1819. in »
they told him that if the venture railea
could stand the expense of it himself ; it
succeeded they would reconsider the matter.
When Raffles hoisted the British flag o
the swampy foreshore of the island, the popu-
lation consisted of 150 fishermen and
Four months later it had increased to oUUU.
It became a haven of refuge for the victims
of native and Dutch tyranny in the surround-
ing seas. The Chinese rapidly swamped all
the other races, and for a long time the
English struggled with,their secret societies
for control of the colony. The Government
won the fight for law and order; but nothing
but extermination could have prevented the
Chinese from dominating the commerce of
the settlement. The population rose like a
flood, and to-day approaches the half-million,
two-thirds Chinese. Blue-trousered coolies
from Fukien and Kwangtung founded dynas-
ties of Chinese plutocrats whose reigning
sovereigns now occupy, with their hideous
palaces, the swagger suburb of Tanglin, till
recently the exclusive foreign suburb; the
next-best sites are occupied by the Omega-
shaped tombs of the coolie ancestors.
There are still, however, large areas of wild
or rural charm on Singapore, which lias a
picturesqueness all its own. There is no
background to its landscapes. The little
tossed-up hills, shaven and crowned by single
trees, are silhouetted against the pale sky
in flat relief. They turn towards you like
smooth foreheads of Chinese ancients buried
to their ears. The scent of pineapples is
everywhere, and on all the roads loaded bul-
lock-carts are stringing down towards the
wharves. Long aisles of cocoanut-palms
dance a hurried minuet as you go past; down
in a miniature valley yon catch the gleam of a
miniature lake with a miniature village stand-
ing on piles at its edge and its surface flaked
with the pink lotus; your Australian gharrie-
pony drops a reminiscent tear at suddenly
coming on a little landscape of a little hill
crowned with the graceful form of an Irvin-
gia malayana, a tree strangely similar in
appearance to an Australian gum.
So little was the work of Stamford
Raffles valued by his English contem-
poraries that his burial-place was unknown
until a few years ago ; but fortunately he had
a biographer whose testimony was worth
more than all the conventional panegyrics.
His name was Abdullah bin Abdul Ivadir.
He was an unsophisticated native youth from
Malacca, whom the great Englishman em-
ployed to teach him Malay. His interesting
record is the first example of Malayan jour-
nalese. This, more or less literally trans-
lated, is how lie described his master: —
His brow was broad, a sign of organising power;
his head was dome-shaped, a sign of resourcefulness ;
his hair was wan, indicating courage ; his ears large
to allow him to hear everything ; his eyebrows thick
his left, eye squinted. His nose was sharp-cut, his
cheeks hollow' and his lips thin—the mark of a
good talker. He had a sweet tongue, a wide mouth
and a tapering neck, and the color of his body was
moderately fair. He had a chest like a billowing
sail, and his waist was lissom and his feet w'ere of
a medium size ; he walked with a stoop. His habit
was thoughtful, he was sweet-faced to all men an 1
his hand opened to the poor ; lie was clever at killing
words (repartee), but he always smiled. He was
very methodical, and I noticed that it was his
custom every evening, after dinner with his friends,
to have pens, ink and paper and two lighted candles
kept ready on a table; he would walk up and down
the room until he was tired, and then he would lean
on the table and shut his eyes like a man sleeping;
then suddenly he would start up and commence writ-
ing with great swiftness; and then resume his
sleeping posture. Thus and thus until 11 or 12
o’clock, when he would go to bed. In the morning,
walking to and fro, he would re-read what he had
written; three or four sheets out of 10 he would
give to his juru-tulis to copy into a book ; the rest
he tore up and flung away. This was his custom
every day.
Ignorant Foreign Office officials had
brought this man’s wonderful administration
of Java to nought by handing the island back
to its former Dutch owners, who immedi-
ately applied their old policy of exclusion to
all the eastern seas. It was to break through
this barrier that Raffi.es fixed on Singa-
pore ; and if his method of acquiring it was
not strictly according to the ethics of im-
perialism it should be remembered that
Malaya was a brawling collection of semi-
piratical States at the time, and gave him no
option. The contract he made was with the
illegitimate son of a neighboring Sultan who
claimed the usual shadowy suzerainty over
the island. The lure of a subsidy which
represented unheard-of wealth to a Malay
potentate brought the pretender over to Sin-
gapore, where he was elevated to the rank of
Sultan, with the right to maintain a stand-
ing army and control of half the island. As
Singapore became more and more a great
Eurasian mart, he became an unnecessary
anachronism; and his final escape to
Malacca makes pathetic reading in Abdul-
lah’s lively prose. It was on Raffles’s
suggestion, and with the same intention of
combating Dutch exclusiveness, that Raffles
Bay, in N. Australia, was founded ; but the
customary doom of enterprise in that region
fell on it.
The wheel has come full circle, and the
Dutch colonists of to-day regard the Singa-
pore base as an essential bulwark to their
own possessions. The great empire-builder
left the scene of his endeavors in February.
1824, and the vessel on which was the price-
less scientific collection of a lifetime was
burnt to the water’s edge before it got out
of sight of land. In 1826 the East India
Co. demanded from him a refund with inter-
est of £22,000 for salaries and commission
drawn 10 years before, and shortly aftm-
he was beggared by the failure of a bi«
Indian commercial house. • He died in the
same year at 45, and was buried obscurely
in Hendon churchyard.
It is an indication of how severely the
world has shrunk in the last half-dozen
years that the defence of Australia should


depend, not so much on what the Federal
Government decides to do with the citizens
training scheme as on what a handful of
British War Office people decide should be
done with Singapore; and the character of
Sir Stamford Raffles becomes of consider-

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Class-conscious Sport.
A baffling feature of Labor-Socialist poli-
tics is the protection and favor extended to
the gambling element by those who speak for
Labor in Australia. While the general body
of wagepayers are regarded with morose
hostility, “moderate” Laborites being bent on
expropriating them by “constitutional
methods,” whatever they may be, and extrem-
ists arguing that only violence will meet the
case, the gentlemen of leisure who batten on
the betting business are held in the highest
esteem. This was curiously exemplified when
Alderman Mick Burke, of the Sydney City
Council, was charged before a Royal Com-
mission with having offered to get a road
regraded for a company in the wool trade —
at the ratepayers’ expense, of course —for
“four fifties,” half down and the balance on
delivery. After denying the allegation,
which he did most fervently, Alderman
Burke explained that he was a commission-
agent of the sort that keeps neither books
nor banking account, and that his most
profitable transactions were with small pun-
ters “who thought they could get a better
price on the course than they would by
betting in the city.”
That is the best commission of all. You see, if
a horse starts at six to four, and I get eight to one,
I might get half. of the winnings. The amount
earned during the year in this way would exceed
£lOO.
The report adds that “witness refused to
give the names of the punters for whom he
had acted,, and could not remember the meet-
ing at which he received the 50 p.c. commis-
sion, nor the name of the race nor that
of the horse—-he was “a pretty poor hand at
remembering the names of racehorses.” Had
the inquiry as to the “four-fifties" allegation
been delayed for a few days, Alderman
Burke would now be Lord Mayor of Syd-
ney ; as it was, the Municipal Labor party,
of "which he was recently leader, gave him a
unanimous vote of confidence (this without
waiting for the Royal Commissioner’s re-
port, which is dead against him), and he
has since been placed second on the list of
Labor nominees for the five Sydney seats in
the Leg. Assembly, three of which the party
holds already. In short, Mysterimis Mick,
who admits earning part of his income by
hanging round the betting-ring, is unhesitat-
ingly accepted as “a doughty champion of the
class-conscious proletariat,” and has been
so described; whereas a Delprat or a
McKay, who establishes an industry in which
thousands of workmen earn good White Aus-
tralian wages, is regarded in the same quar-
ter as “a bowelless exploiter of the toiling
masses.” Of course, the gambling interest
has powerful friends among so-called Nation-
alist politicians too. That was shown in the
N. S. Wales Parliament during the long-
drawn-out farce _of the pony-racing commit-
tee’s repprt, which was talked out in the
end after a choice exhibition of humbug on
both sides. Additional evidence was fur-
nished in the Victorian Assembly, when
Ministerialists joined with the Labor party
to shout down the Government’s proposal to
clap a 1 p.c. tax on the turnover of licensed
bookmakers —there are 962 in Victoria, and
their turnover is estimated at the astonishing
figure of £15,000,000 p.a., while the un-
licensed and tax-dodging McShortodds pro-
bably handles £10,000,000 more —instead
of the stamp-duties on betting tickets.
But McShortodds and the Wrens and
Joynton Smiths of proprietary racing
mostly cleave to the anti-capitalist party,
even as their huge profits are chiefly sup-
plied by the wage-earning class. Perhaps
their idea is that they will occupy a privi-
leged position when the Socialist (or Com-
munist) Republic arrives and the triumphant
proletariat gets its living by going to the
races.

Australia, Canada and Odious
Comparisons.
“As a result of residence in England, the Earl
said lie had been much struck by the gross ignorance
prevailing amongst English people in regard to
Australia. All this was due to lack of efficient pub-
licity about the country. Canada, which did things
in a different way, was well known as part of the
British Empire in England, and was attracting
hundreds of immigrants of the best type, while
Australia was still regarding an effective immigration
policy as one of her insoluble problems.”
Australia’s only earl, or at any rate its best-
known earl, Ducie, of Queensland, returned
a few days ago from a visit to the Cold
Country, with his blushing coronet thick
upon him, and supplied an interviewer with
this unhelpful observation. The detrimental
comparison of this country with Canada has
been made so often by so many vague people
that it becomes rather a burden. By way of
getting down to particulars, the following
points may be considered: —
It may be quite true that Canada is better
known in England than Australia is. Still, ignorance
can’t be measured or weighed, and probably very
little is known in the Cold Country about Canada
either, despite its comparative next-doorness. Globe-
trotters think England knows the Dominion because
they meet in hotel reading-rooms and such-like places
with stacks of pictured literature about Canada's
giant mountains, its great and innumerable lakes,
its pine forests, its long, deep, swift rivers, its
glamors and its glaciers and its bears; but, after
all, (he man who toils for his daily beer all the
week doesn’t use these hotels. Australia doesn't
advertise on the same lines because it is short ol
all the above assets, and it doesn’t want to be a
liar and invent them.
Though Canada, including its islands and icebergs, is
750,000 square miles larger than the Commonwealth,
and is much more than twice as old, counting from the
date ,of settlement, and is a much older British
possession, it had only about 60 per cent, more
people on last census. The figures were: Canada,
8,788,483, and the Commonwealth, 5,435,734. Ana
the Commonwealth had many more inhabitants of
British, descent than Canada.
The Statesman’s Year Book reports that the
“immigrant arrivals in Canada” in 1922-23 num-
bered 72,887, of whom 34,508 were British. The
rest were a mixed lot. About the departures in-
formation is lacking, but at last census date there
were 1,117,878 Canadians living in the United
States, which suggests a big exodus. In 1923 the
Commonwealth got and retained 37,540 immigrants,
almost all British —that was the surplus of arrivals
over departures. Quite possibly Australia is doing
the better of the twp in the way of capturing
“hundreds of immigrants of the best type,” as the
vague but noble lord put it. Certainly it never
received 8404 Jews in one year, as Canada did. And
Canada has the advantage that its nearest neighbor
is a white man who can be admitted. All our
big near neighbors are of the colored persuasion,
and can’t.
Tons of rot —bally rot and the common sort
■ —have been and are being and doubtless will
be expended in drawing comparisons between
Australia and Canada, and never, or hardly
ever, does one supplier of the article touch
on the matter which really counts. Aus-
tralia wants more good immigrant popula-
tion, but it wants, a thousand times over,
better diffusion of population. The big
Dominion, despite its 8,788,483 of popula-
tion, has no bloated cities nearly the size of
Sydney and Melboux-ne, but it has cultivated
more towns, and its eighth town beats Aus-
tralia’s eighth by nearly 40,000 inhabitants.
It has no slum area like the County of Cum-
berland, with 650 persons to the square mile,
and no habitable region so utterly neglected
as the N. Territory and Northern Westralia.
One explanation is that the Canadian trans-
continental railway was opened in 1886,
while ours is hardly started yet. In Canada
the mediaeval Australian policy of closed
ports is unknown, and it is considered the
legitimate thing to found a new city here and
there —a thing Australia never does, unless
Canberra is called a city. Also Canada has
a real tariff, and it makes no fetich or
graven image of the “primary industries.”
Unless the Commonwealth gets a new policy
it may acquire 20,000,000 people and yet
Empty Australia may be as empty and as
much of a danger is it is to-day. Even
though it acquired 28,323 dubious Austrians
inside 12 months, which happened to Canada
just before the war, the real problem would
remain.

Theodore and His Apologists.
By “Solomon Malaprop” under date De-
cember 23:
Owing to a limited amount of travelling, by trarn-
car at my own expense, I only now have an oppor-
tunity to comment on the remarks of Randolph
Bedford in The Bulletin dated two days hence.
I fully recognise that Queensland, which has the
worst-paying railway system on the mainland (for
years it had the worst one in the Commonwealth),
has more mileage to carry than any other State.
And it had the most mileage to carry in the last
year of “Tory Government,” when its system was
the best-paying of the lot. The mountains were
just as bad then, too, especially those between
Rockhampton and Longreach, and the west was, and
still is, a dreadful place for grades and tunnels. I
know' of two culverts myself on the Hughenden-
Winton section. Incidentally, Westralia has much
more railway (same gauge) in proportion to popu-
lation than Queensland, and it has just managed to
show earnings of £4 18s. per cent, on capital,
against Queensland’s £1 10s. 7d. As regards “the
numerous branch lines,” viewed as a cause of loss,
the map makes Queensland appear singularly deficient
in branches as compared with the maze of them in
N.S.W. and Victoria.
If it was the change from “Tory Government” to
Theodore Government w'hich made the spurt in the
cotton industry, it is remarkable that it didn’t
begin, like the railway slump, as soon as the new
people took office, instead of remaining torpid till
a handsome guarantee came along, the Commonwealth
sharing the expense. If it is a fact, as Mr. Bedford
says, that the increase of the area planted was 31,284
acres between 1922 and 1923, and only 20,000 acres
between 1923 and 1924, progress would seem to be
slowing down again. Possibly there are fears that
the guarantee won’t last.
It seems to me unfortunate that the Federal
Statistician’s latest record of State taxes paid should
differ so widely from Mr. Bedford’s figures. He
makes them: Queensland, 84s. 6d. per head
for the year; N.S.W., 71s. 9d.; S.A., 70s.
lOd.; Tasmania, 665. 6d. ; Westralia, 575.
6d.; and Victoria, 51s. 3d. Of course there
are other sources of revenue, such as railway and
land receipts, but these mentioned above are taxes.
And yet Queensland collected less per head in 1923
than in any of the three previous years. I suppose
the fact that it was the only State which got less
out of its average taxpayer in 1923 than in 1920-21-
22 was due to the sources of revenue beginning
t) dry up, for I never heard of any taxes being taken
off. This idea of poverty is supported by the fact
that Mr. Bedford’s State is, of all the mainland
States, and notwithstanding its tremendous natural
wealth and advantages, the poorest contributor per
head to the returns under the five direct and uniform
taxes which the Commonwealth collects. It is the
only State whose gross revenue was less in 1923 than
ir. 1921, which also suggests the drying-up process.
And it is the only State in which the proportion of
factory worKere to population has declined, the
decline synchronising, like so many other things,
with the advent of Theodore and Co. Comparing
1923 with 1914, Victoria had 108 more people out
of every 10,000 in factory employment at the end
of the period than at the beginning; four other
States showed improvements; and Queensland, the
lost dog of the family, had 100 fewer factory
workers per 10,000 in 1923 than in 1914. Mr.
Bedford makes some distinction between “factories
that count” and those that don’t—that is to say,
factories that he counts and some other sort. But
it is really best to take the official figures as they
stand.
To hark back a little, Mr. Bedford attributes the
lamentable financial results of the Queensland rail-
ways during the Theodore regime to the “numerous
branch lines serving agricultural districts, where
primary products, carried at low rates, form the bulk
of the traffic.” The map. as already mentioned,
doesn’t show any unwonted numerosity of branch
lines, and I would like to know more about these
“agricultural districts.” According to the latest
“Official Year Book” (pages 674-675), Queensland
has fewer acres under crop than any other mainland
State (835,060 acres against little Victoria’s 4,862,548).
Of all the States it has the smallest percentage of its
area under crop—less than one-fourth the Com-
monwealth’s average, and less than one-fortieth Vic-
toria’s percentage. It has even fewer cultivated
acres in proportion to its population than any other
State. To have the real back seat for agricultural
population, and to have acquired under Theodore
the furthest back seat save one for manufacturing
population, is something. In 1914 the State had
641 per 10,000 of its people in factories, and only
Victoria showed anything better. In 1922-23 Queens-
land’s figure was 541 per 10,000, and only Tasmania
showed anything worse. If hauling so little
agricultural produce makes so much loss under Theo-
dore, but not before Theodore, there is something
decomposed in the State of Denmark.
It is true that .Queensland factories are more
manned and less womaned than those of N.S.W.
and S.A. And the figures on page 15 of the latest
“Quarterly Statistics” suggest that these two States
pay their women better than Queensland does its
men.
Probably a great deal of enlightenment has come
to the gang, or what remains of it, of cranks, vision-
aries, political engineers, pro-Huns and experimen-
talists who acquired office in 1915. But it is impos-
sible to put things right without admitting that
they have gone wrong, and difficult to put them
right while noisy admirers keep shouting that they
are absolutely right already. Having trained their
followers, Ministers would have a hard job to un-
train them. They have to support their supporters.
The position has a distant resemblance to that of
the Kelly gang, which owed its long immunity to
information furnished by sympathisers, who required
payment. The tale goes that the miserable gang
had to stick to its old haunts for life and keep on
robbing because the embarrassing friends who lived
on it might have made it fatal to leave off. In
political bushranging it may also be fatal to leave off.

The Crown of Martyrdom.
Maoriland law sat up tile other day at
Auckland and sentenced Oswald Bourbeau,
president of the local Communist party, to
three months’ gaol, while Evan John
Thomas, secretary of the same pernicious
organisation, got off with two months. The
charge against them was the circulation ot
literature which taught and advocated mur-
der, rape, arson, robbery, riot, assault and
usurpation of the power which belongs to
the people. In other words, the book
that the trouble was about advocated
the Bolshevik variety of revolution, which
covers all these things. The sentences were
absurdly inadequate, though they were
probably less so than anything that would
have happened to the pair on this side of the
Tasman Sea, and it would seem that there
was an absurdly long delay in taking action,
for the criminals boasted of having sold 1100
copies of the work in question. It.is a mat-
ter for argument whether the individual who
preaches and advocates and probably pro-
fesses to organise violent revolution in a
country where the people rule (except when
they are too tired), shouldn’t qualify for a
life term at the most, and a very long term
at the least. Treason against one ruler is
provided for in the majority of criminal codes,
and treason against the whole mass of rulers
should be regarded as very considerably
worse. The law has a way of its own,
though often an inefficient way, with the ob-
jectionable character who incites to the com-
mission of one crime, or conspires with a
view to its commission, or who keeps a school
for young criminals, after the fashion of
Fagin. It should be much more rigorous in
the case of the more objectionable character
who incites and conspires to the commission
of all the known crimes at once, except, per-
haps, cannibalism and suicide, though in Bol-
shevik Russia even these became common
enough. The attitude of the aggressive Com-
munist is that any attempt to interfere with
the preparation of the gory surprise which
he is preparing for humanity would consti-
tute an outrage against Free Speech and
would bring down on the community his
severe displeasure; but it might be best to
chance the displeasure. He further pro-
fesses that his proposed crime, because it is
so vast and so monstrous, is really a reli-
gion, and the cult of a new god of sorts, and
that any serious effort at its suppression will
constitute him a martyr. Yet so long as he
is out of the way it doesn’t seem to matter
much what he is constituted.

The Basic-Wage Bubble.
That Professor A. M. Carr-Saunders,
M.P., of Liverpool University, should advo-
cate a minimum wage of £3 2s. 4d. per week
for a family of five in Britain is a sad
example of the debauching influence of poli-
tics on even the soberest minds. The Pro-
fessor is an expert on social matters, and his
book, “The Population Problem,” published
a couple of years ago, is a standard work.
So he ought to know better. He ought to
know that a most certain result of lifting the
wage to an artificial level will be that the
overcrowded island will become more con-
gested than ever; further, unemployment will
increase, because industries compelled to
pay a higher wage than similar industries
in Continental Europe with which they are
in competition will go out of business, so
that more hands will be thrown out of work
and more mouths will open for the dole. Also
the few industries which survive the strain
of paying the minimum wage will be com-
pelled to get rid of the poor worker and take
on a higher type whose greater efficiency will
make his labor worth the higher wage; the
inefficient man, drifting down, will swell the
ranks of the unemployable or only partially-
employed, whose prolific birth-rate always
increases the more precarious or utterly
hopeless their prospects become. The popu-
lation principle, which is at the root of
international war, internal revolution, social
unrest, the jealousies of trades unions and
the misery of submerged millions, not being
generally realised, or, if it is realised, being
treated, like syphilis, as unfit for discussion
in polite circles, the right of the worker to a
“basic” wage, irrespective of his capacity
to earn it, will be enthusiastically endorsed
by Radicals and Conservatives alike; and
when the worker does not get it, his misery
will be increased by the delusive, thought
that his suffering is due to capitalistic con-
spiracy ; whereupon the usual result will
follow in strikes, hunger-marches, Bolshe-
vik murmurings and Fascist reaction.
If the hyphenated professor who is advo-
cating the basic-wage delusion as a cure-all
for his country’s ills wants some first-hand
information he should study the operations
of the disastrous thing in this country. This
smiling land —it is mainly an empty, smile-
is a long way off the saturation point with
regard to population. It should be able to
support ten times more people than it does. It
has the basic wage; in fact, it breeds basic
wages; yet an unemployed deputation waited
on Vic. Premier Allan the other day which
claimed to represent 5000 out-of-work, union-
ists, and stated that Melbourne’s jobless
army alone exceeded 10,000. Their remedy
for this state of affairs included work or
sustenance, based on the basic wage, for
both men and women, and maintenance by
the community of those incapable of earning
the basic wage. In other words, the estab-
lishment of a minimum wage having pre-
vented Australian industry from absorbing
the population, the cure for the consequent
unemployment was more minimum waste.
Australia is an undeveloped country cryifg
for population, and if this is the vicious
circle the politicians have achieved by tam-
pering with economics and ignoring funda-
mental causes,' there is hot much hope of the
same methods proving successful in England,
where population has already overstepped
the margin of potential subsistence.

Freedom in Home-Building.
Of all the arts architecture is the most
imitative. , What one builder erects all
builders erect with minor variations. Even
the material supplied and the builder’s fur-
nishings are all conceived with the idea that
any place to be put up will be almost an
exact replica of all its fellows. This seems
to have been pretty much the case in all
ages. Variations of the arch mark the styles
of building which went on for centuries. The
Greek variations, once the general type was
fixed, are mostly in the differing sections of
the column ; and, although the great Gothic
cathedrals show an endless diversity of
general design, each design is made up of
countless details which are as much alike as
the dials of Chinamen. Australian domestic
architecture, where it is notof the packing-case
and kerosene-tin order, is generally borrowed
either from the England of Geokge 111.
or from modern America; and the latter lias
in turn borrowed from Switzerland, although
the Swiss conditions are absent where the
new buildings are erected. Many great
modern buildings, notably Westminster Cath-
edral, have frankly borrowed from every-
thing on earth that could lend itself to the
purpose; and all art chatter about architec-
ture seems to recognise that judicious steal-
ing is the be-all of the craft. Yet it is not
really conceivable that the human mind has
reached the end of its tether in evolving
new forms : and perfectly natural forms of
architectural beauty might reasonably be ex-
pected to grow up from crude beginnings in
Australia. If the Greek hut created the
temple of Athene, why should not the bark
humpy father the future Australian mansion?
But—in some States, at any rate —the Local
Government Act jumps in with a large foot.
The intention is good. Height, ventilation
and air space are assuredly required in liv-
ing x’ooms, together with some guarantee that
the building shall stay where it is put. But
the local authorities go far beyond this. In
one shire just beyond the suburbs of Sydney
a flat roof is forbidden. Ignorant of the fact
that half the world lives under flat roofs, and
practically all the world in climates similar
to Sydney, this council steps in to force the
existing convention upon all builders. No
doubt the idea is that for the sake of cheap-
ness builders would lay galvanised iron flat
on wooden wall-plates and create hideous
blots on the landscape; but a better framed
regulation could have prevented this without
making a general rule against a manner of
building which is neither unsightly nor un-
healthy. Nor is the N. S. Wales regulation
that a building must show a clear space of
9ft. 6in. between floor and ceiling much more
satisfactory. Given sufficient air space and
a sufficient chamber between ceiling and roof,
fine effects can be obtained by making broad
panelled rooms loWer than the orthodox
height. If air space and ventilation alone
were insisted on without any sort of inter-
ference with the form, better results might
be obtained. Where so many people build
their own homes with their own hands new
ideas might reasonably be expected to evolve
if the freedom necessary for the evolution
were allowed. At present the greater develop-
ment of the sleeping-out verandah —a part
of the building little touched by regulation
—is the only notable sign of progress.
■ ♦
Parliamentary Pensions.
“Wealsman” states the case for a down-
trodden class: —
Tas. Laborites, at a recent annual conference, ret
up a committee to overhaul the Payment of Members
Act with a view to amendment. The committee :s
to report on, among other things, the feasibility of
some sort of pension system for Parliamentarians. It
is claimed by the advocates of pensions that a
member who serves ; his public faithfully and well
during the best years of his life cannot possibly serve
his own interests. He cannot save money, even on
the Federal salary of £lOOO a year, much less on
the £3OO to £5OO allowed in the State Parliaments
The same truth applies to Ministers and State
Ministerial salaries. No straight politician ever
made money out of politics; and if the country
wants (it certainly needs) that sort of politician, it
must be prepared to encourage him by insuring
him against abject poverty in his old age.
The Labor Party, unless it has wholly lost its
punch as a reform and democratic party, may be
expected to show more interest in the matter of
pensions than either of the other parties; but the; e
is no very obvious reason why the other parties,
especially the Cocky party, should not also sit up
and take notice. The difficulty will lie in the dis-
covery of a workable scheme. Pensions should be
on a sliding scale. If a man devotes three of the
best years of his money-making period of life to
the public interest—well, the honor may be sufficient
recompense. If he is re-elected and serves six
years in all, he might be said to have fairly earned,
say, £5O a year for life. If he serves a further
three < years, making nine years deleted from the
period which other men devote to the gathering of
gear, he is probably too old or out of the running
to return to his:original trade or business with any
chance of real success. The average Parliamentary
life of the very straightest and most competent legis-
lators these States • have known is not much over,
perhaps rather less, than nine years. Electors control
the situation, and if electors desire a change of
members, who is to say them nay? But surely a
man who has devoted his whole time to his con-
stituents and his party for nine .years should be
worth a pension of £lOO a year for the rest of his
life. He may be defeated by a mere handful of
votes, and for no particular reason. He may fail to
secure his quota by sheer accident; many well-known
men have failed by half a dozen votes purely by
reason of the cocksureness of their supporters.
Some fail because the wearing task of faithfully
serving their fellows in Parliament .has robbed them
of the original vigor and freshness of expression

which once or twice or thrice at elections had
attracted good audiences and numerous votes. He
may have grown old in the service of his consti-
tuents. No man grows younger in a dozen years of
strenuous Parliamentary service. The more faithfully
he devotes himself to his job the sooner he is headed
for the scrapheap. If he is still young, and his
defeat is narrow, he may try again at the next
elections, after three years. If he succeeds, well
and good. But it is not easy to “come back” even
in politics, and the Parliamentarian once defeated
would be well advised to get uack to his trade or
profession and do his best to make up for lost
time. He will probably fail either way, but naturally
he will strive to make his failure as inconspicuous as
possible. But he ought to be entitled to the pension,
in any case, as long as he stays out of Parliament.
The electors might easily find it cheaper, in the end,
to pension their politicians than to retain them as
Parliamentary representatives or to permit or force
them to crawl to the party in political power for
a billet in the public service. And it may be
better for the whole community to pension its played-
out publicists than to make publicans of them.
The subject is intriguing, like politics, and in-
inexhaustible, unlike space.
'
Russia and the Single-tax.
Dear Bulletin, —“Solomon Malaprop”
endeavors (B. 11/12/24) to make good his
statement (the inaccuracy of which I clearly
proved in The Bulletin, 4/12/24) that the
single-tax was tried in Russia and failed.
This modern “Solomon” assures us that
the tenants of the confiscated land were
allowed, as I said they would have been under
the single-tax, “ ‘to retain the whole of the
produce subject to payment of the [econo-
mic] rent.” But that is exactly what they
were not allowed to do*, as everybody who has
read up the _ question is aware, and as
“Solomon” himself admitted in a paragraph
(B. 4/12/24) in which he stated that “the
agricultural rents had to be collected in
kind, and they had to be heavy to make up
for losses in other directions; hence agricul-
ture languished,” etc. Now, the economic
rent is the annual value attaching to land as
a result of supply and demand (not enforced,
as in Russia, at the bayonet’s point), and is
certainly not the bulk of the produce, which
was seized under the Russian Soviet, with
the very natural sequence that the peasants
refused to work their land any longer and
fled into tin; cities, as already described in
my letter. Furthermore “Solomon” tells us
that “the Government did not tax mine-
owners” (who would have had to hand over
a pretty stiff royalty under the single-tax),
“shipowners, importers, wholesale and re-
tail dealers, bankers, etc., because it was or
tried to be all these itself, but it taxed the
land or the man on it.” That is to say, it
tried, and egregiously failed, as we know,
to carry on all the business itself, and, as
“Solomon” himself tells us. taxed the man
on the land heavily “to make up for losses
in other directions”; whereas, under the
single-tax, all the business would be carried
on by Private Enterprise, and the bulk of
the taxation would come, not from the man
on the (agricultural) land, where values are
comparatively low, but from the man on the
land in the city, where values are high ; as
witness the £1750 a foot paid for it in
Castlereagh-street, Sydney, a couple of
months ago. “Malaprop” cites two defini-
tions _of Freetrade, and says that Russia
experienced the conditions appertaining to
both. That may be, but he leaves out of
account the principal characteristic of the
term, which is that trade should be free,
whereas freedom is the one thing that Russia
has been deprived of by the Soviet. Social-
ism and Communism have been tried there,
but never the single tax. So far from Henry
George’s ideas being merely idle dreams, they
have already been carried out with remark-
able success in the municipal sphere in both
Queensland and N. S. Wales, and when thev
have been extended to the State and Federal
spheres, and freedom of production and ex-
change made the law of the land, then for the
first time in our history we shall have cast
off the bonds that have bound us hitherto,
and one country, at any rate, will be thor-
oughly democratic and genuinely free. —Yours,
Percy R. Meggy.
A
The New Sugar Proposals.
The Prime Minister visited Queensland
when the House of Representatives bad
finished its year’s work, and returned full
of admiration for his Government’s sugar
policy. That policy he, proposes to continue
for three more years, with certain modifica-
tions in favor of consumers. Under the 1923
arrangement the price of raw sugar was re-
duced from £3O 6s. Sd. to £27 per ton. and
the retail price of refined sugar from 6d. to
per lb., while various concessions were
granted to retailers, brewers, tanners, drug-
gists, fruit-canners and manufacturers of
jam, biscuits, cakes, cordials, confectionery,
condiments and the like. If the new pro-
posals do not miscarry, refined sugar will re-
main at 44d. per lb. retail, but grocers will
get half-ton lots at the rate of £37 6s. Bd.
P-t., 4s. Bd. p.t. less than at present (house-
wives’ associations are to be allowed the same
privilege) ; manufacturers of products for
home consumption, other than fruit, will pay
£36 11s. 9d. p.t., a reduction of Bs. 3d.; and
‘■processors” of fruit for home consumption
will be accommodated at £3O Os. Sd. p.t., £5 Os.
4d. less than at present. As regards mill-
white sugar, which does not figure in the
existing arrangement, the retail price will
be 4d. per lb., but retailers and housewives
will get half-ton parcels for 34d. per lb.; and
the wholesale and manufacturing price (the
latter only where the goods are sold in Aus-
tralia) will be £32 10s. Od. p.t. Sugar for
exported manufactures is to be supplied at
“the Australian-in-bond equivalent” of the
world price as determined by a committee
on which the Government will be represented,
as well as manufacturers and growers; and
the industry is to bear all losses on sales of
sugar abroad, as at present. If the British
Government concedes a preference of £4 ss.
Od. a ton for ten years, as was indicated
at the 1923 Economic Conference, these losses
will not be great; there may, indeed, be times
when the export transactions will show a
profit. The Prime Minister’s announcement
lias drawn the usual howls from provincial-
minded southern editors, who allege, with
tedious repetition, that the growers are mak-
ing fortunes under the 1923-25 agreement.
McCawley, C.J., a careful man, went into
the question thoroughly when dealing with a
claim for higher wages, and came to the con-
clusion that the said fortunes existed in the
editorial imaginations. He reported, in
effect, that the growers were doing well,
but not too well. A sugar arrangement that
satisfied all sections has never been made yet,
and perhaps never will be ; but as far as can
be judged, the Bruce-P'age arrangement is a
pretty good one for the growers and not a
THE ENEMY.
bad one for the Commonwealth—it will
enable a vital North Australian industry
to keep its head above water, and that with-
out imposing unfair burdens on manufac-
turers, fruitgrowers or householders.

There is no reason why N. S. Wales should
not have a useful Upper House, superior
to the. Lower one in quality, instead of a
gathering of wholly unrepresentative nomi-
nees, some of whom (like some aldermen)
have little or no visible means of livelihood
except their ostensibly honorary billets—a
gathering which is treated to malediction
when it tries, as it did the other day, to
do something good and useful. A paid body,
elected after the manner of the Senate by
the State as a single constituency, would
probably reflect public sentiment better than
the rival show, and debate about their re-
spective powers could be settled by giving
them exactly the same powers. When a
bottomless gulf yawned between the two
authorities over a free railway pass or the
like, a joint sitting could easily bridge the
chasm. Then there would be an end of the
periodical blither about the necessity for
squashing the old men up above, and a'finish
to the speculation as to the secret reason
why Brownjones, M.L.C., was appointed,
and what on earth Brownjones lives on
now that he is appointed.
A playlet staged recently at Sydney Quar-
ter Sessions should have been billed as “The
Humble Piece-worker; a Drama in Half
an Act.” The star, William Jackson, who
was doing 12 months for larceny of tools,
applied to be declared a habitual criminal
and allowed to stay on when his year is up,
he having stolen enough tools to qualify.
“Habituals” are allowed to earn money
while doing their term, and the applicant,
making a guess at the time of his discharge,
reckoned on coming out with £3OO. A case
of a man leaving prison with £450 was
quoted. Jackson's wish was gratified. A
simple and feasible-looking explanation is
that he is a highly expert tradesman (in
fact, he was so described), and it is only by
being a prisoner that he can be free to let
himself go on piece-work instead of being
a day-wage slave, ordered to go slow, ruin-
ously fined or disqualified out of his union
for not going slow enough, and called out
on strike just when he thought he was get-
ting a few pounds put by. If a man could
only arrange to be declared a habitual crimi-
nal without being a criminal at all applica-
tions would probably come in by hundreds.
“Stone walls do not a prison make.” Some-
times the gaol is outside.

Premier Lyons is responsible for the asser-
tion that there is a growing anti-Federal
spirit in Tasmania, largely caused by the
present Commonwealth Ministers’ cavalier
treatment of reasonable suggestions put for-
ward on behalf of Tasmanian interests. The
immediate cause of Lyons’s outburst is the
Commonwealth’s attitude of unconcern in re-
gard to the Speck’s hop-growing industry,
which is threatened with extinction. The
other day Lyons asked the Bruce Cabinet
to receive a deputation of hop-people, headed
by himself, which proposed to unfold particu-
lars of a new scheme by which it was hoped
the Commonwealth and Tasmania in combina-
tion might avert the menacing disaster.
Bruce telegraphed a reply to the effect that
the Commonwealth Government already knew
all that was to be known about the hop ques-
tion, though if the Tasmanian growers liked
they could submit their new scheme in writ-
ing. The Priminister also ventured to
think the State Government might be able
to assist its own hop-growers out of the tight
place. Premier Lyons declares that he re-
gards all this as an “affront to Tasmania,’’
and if he hadn’t been such a perfect gentle-
man he would probably have described it as
a piece of Commonwealth impertinence. Of
course the Priminister disclaims any intention
of discourtesy to the State Premier, and the
latter disclaims having taken the “affront”
personally. But Lyons holds that the sur-
plus hops (some 7000 bales) which are the
cause of all the trouble are now in Australia
through Commonwealth negligence and to the
Commonwealth Customs’ profit; therefore to
suggest that. Tasmania should relieve the hop-
growers on its own, so to speak, is something
that Premier Lyons’s strict upbringing and
strong Federalism prevent him saying it is.
“G.D.M.”: May one put forward a novel
idea concerning the Japanese objective m
the Pacific? All through my hectic life my
native land has been threatened by visionary
bogeys who wanted to filch a little P
like this, nearly 3,000,000 miles of a a
and 12,000 miles of coast line. Directly
the last bogey was laid by the surrender
of Germany, a new flibbertigibbet was in-
vented to frighten Australian lads to sleep
and send senile readers of the Argus and
S. M. Herald into fits of fear. Here comes
Japan to take Australia and make slaves
of all of us.'’ People who have never been
beyond Queenscliff have been known to say
the rising tide of color is so serious that
the 42,000,000 of Javanese and Malays might
land at Darwin and march south. No Java-
nese has ever been known to kill a fly, and if
they all came (how is never stated) our
weapons need only be insectibane and
pea-shooters. Nor will Japan bother to raid
Australia while she has a better and bigger
country to occupy close at hand. Australia
covers nearly 3,000.000 sq. miles, the United
States even less, while Siberia has an area
of 6,000,000 sq. miles and a population _of
only 20,000,000. Japan can land a million
men, women and children in Korea in a
week, and from that safe base organise a
great trek into Russian Siberia. It is less
than 24 hours away by steamer. The quick
retort by those who don’t know is that
Siberia is too cold a country for settlement
by the Japs. There may be about 500,000
sq. miles not habitable near the Arctic
circle, but there is 5,000,000 sq. miles as
good as any land in Australia, North America
or the Argentine fit for settlement, and only
waiting the plough and the settler. Nansen,
the explorer, says Siberia possesses inex-
haustible wealth, and a boundless extent of
fertile land. Coal, iron, copper and silver-
lead exist almost everywhere. Sakhalin
Island, just north of Japan, where there is
a joint possession by Japan and the Soviet,
has oil-wells good enough to supply all
Siberia and the east of Asia with petroleum.
There are endless good forests and abundant
fishing, both sea and inland, A plough could
be run across the country for 5000 miles
through deep, rich, well-watered and wooded
soil. In the south and centre there has been
no ice-age, the valleys having been excavated
by running water and wind. Here, then, is
the ideal country for the surplus millions
of Japanese—easy to take, easy to keep and
easy to control, because its inhabitants are
few and primitive. And surely Japs are not
likely to migrate towards Australia and
Maoriland while a better country than then-
own is available for occupation only a day's
sail away.

The following extract from the report of the
Japanese Social and Colonisation Depart-
ment of the Imperial (Jap) Economic Coun-
cil on Colonial Policy, for 1924, is instruc-
tive :
Japan is a country of limited area aid poor
natural resources, with a surplus of population. . . .
Hundreds of millions of yen have been invested in
Manchuria,. Mongolia and China, but it has con-
tributed very little towards economic development or
Japanese colonisation. The colonisation of the Hok-
kaido [the northern fragment of the Japanese archi-
pelago] is still progressing at a snail’s pace.
From this discouraging spectacle the report
turns its roving eye overseas, to “countries
of extensive area and rich natural resources
which still lie uncultivated for want of labor
and capital.” “It will be necessary.” con-
tinues the document, “to solve the question of
dual nationality, and to follow such diplo-
matic measures as are appropriate, always
taking national conditions and public
opinions in overseas countries into careful
consideration.” These home-grown remarks
help to explain the Geneva protocol shindy
better than tons of foreign comment like the
recent statement of an English newspaper
that the excitement was really about Can-
adian nickel.

TnE Commonwealth Government has got
tired of waiting for the British Government
to make up its mind about beam wireless,
and will erect a station at this end, at a cost
of £120,000, as soon as a site has been decided
on. The Marconi agreement provides for
the erection of a station at the other end
specially for communication with Australia.
There is little doubt, despite platitudinous
denials, that Britain’s P.M.G.’s have side-
tracked Empire wireless ever since the war,
and there are two reasons whv they have
done so. The first is that the British Gov-
ernment. like the Commonwealth, is a big
shareholder in the Pacific Cable, and for
that reason is not eager to encourage any
private wireless concern to collar the
cable business. The second is that the wire-
less people can’t prove that in time of war
their system won’t be “jambed” or tapped
by an enemy. Admitting all that, wireless
has, nevertheless, proved a valuable auxiliary
and has a great field before it; and, though
it has a long way to go before it can replace
the vast organisation built up by the sub-
marine companies, the Federal Government
is doing the right thing in encouraging the
youngster.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Article 428 of the Versailles Treaty pro-
vided that the German territory west of the
Rhine and the bridges at Cologne, Coblenz,
Mainz and Kehl were to be occupied for 15
years. Article 429 went on to say that the
Cologne bridgehead would be given up at
the end of five years, and the Coblenz bridge-
head at the end of 10, “if the conditions of
the Treaty are faithfully performed.” These
words followed :
If the guarantees against unprovoked aggression by
Germany are not considered sufficient, the evacua-
tions may be delayed to the extent regarded as
necessary for the purpose of obtaining the required
guarantees.
As regards reparations and the surrender
of war criminals, Germany has defaulted
persistently and without shame. And, accord-
ing to information which has scared even
the pacific Herriot, it is cunningly preparing
for another attack on France. So the Cologne
bridgehead is not to be evacuated on Jan. 10,
as was confidently anticipated by the default-
ing party, and fierce are the bellowings of
Poisongastein and his sympathisers.
Acting in this instance on the recommen-
dation of two expensive imported experts,
the N. S. Wales Fuller Government has re-
newed James Fraser’s appointment as Chief
Railway Commissioner for a term of seven
years and raised his salary from £3OOO p.a.
to £5OOO p.a. Also, J. H. Cann and H. Fox
are to be succeeded as Assistant Commis-
sioners (at £2500 p.a.) by O. A. Brain, Chief
Electrical Engineer, and A. D. J. Forster,
Chief Mechanical Engineer. On the score of
engineering qualifications there is nothing
against either of the new men, and Forster
has youth on his side —he is only 34. But the
English experts suggested that a traffic man
and a financial man should be associated
with Fraser, himself an engineer, and the
latter recommended T. J. Hartigan, the Chief
Accountant, for one of the posts. The side-
tracking of Hartigan has a decidedly odd
appearance, especially as a dead set was
made against him by a group of “National-
ist” M’s.L.A.
Froth, K.C., and Parchment, the solicitor,
must have rubbed their hands when they
read that' 75 bills had been passed by the
N. S. Wales Parliament during the late ses-
sion. A reference to Hansard to discover
how much consideration each measure had
received would have increased their joy
immensely. On December 16 the Assembly
met, as usual, at 4.30 and wasted two hours
in asking and answering auestions (56 alto-
gether), resuming at 7.45. Between that
time and 9 in the morning it put through
20 bills with only a pretence of discussion,
although some of them (e.g., Closer Settle-
ment and Irrigation Holdings) were very
important. Thus are the would-be destroyers
of representative institutions provided with
powder and shot.
After all, Christmas isn’t indispensable,
for a lot of good Scots get along without it,
and have some whusky on New Year’s Day
instead. As Australia's invariable Christmas
present now is a shipping strike engineered
by some venomous spoilsport of the Daniel
Quilp species, it might not be amiss to sus-
pend the festival for 10 years or so—lay it
up, in other words, like so many Common-
wealth ships.
C.s. : Nowadays preference to unionists
really means preference to strikers, they
being the only people who do strike.
An item from the West:—
The waterside workers of Fremantle have broken
the Melbourne agreement by refusing to work the
Clan Monroe. In this action they are defying the
Melbourne headquarters of the Union, but are acting
the watersiders determining to carry out the instrue-
tions of headquarters.
It isn’t known that the imperious imported
gentleman has flogged any of his humble Aus-
tralian subjects yet, but that may come.
The editor of the official Soviet organ at
Moscow recently let this very large cat out
of the ba 0, :
By careful methods we must guide the British
working class towards disillusionment and disappoint-
ment, so that it will lose faith in peaceful reform,
and adopt revolutionary means to overthrow the
bourgeoisie.
So the handsful of unionists whom the
Walshes and Johansens lead into strikes are
mere pawns in the game—the game of mak-
ing working-men, women and children un-
happy. Was it for this that unions were
formed? And liow long is the law going to
give preference to unions that are led by
men whose object is to spread “disillusion-
ment and disappointment”—in other words,
misery?
THE KIND PREMIER AND THE HUNGRY HOYS.
“Having been defeated by the Leg. Council in his effort to give life railway passes to everybody
who had served in three Parliaments, the N.S.W. Premier announces that he will bring in a special
measure to legalise the gift.”
THE KIND PREMIER: “Never mind, dears, you shall have a plum presently. If you pro-
mise to tell everybody how good I am I’ll find you another ladder.”
Thanks to flabby followers and a sneering
Opposition, there wasn’t much left of the
income-tax proposals when the Leg. Council
had finished with the bill and the Vic. Govern-
ment scrambled into recess. The Govern-
ment asked for another £360,000 to enable it
to meet its obligations, but had to take less
than half of that amount. Nothing could
be more unscientific and inequitable than the
patchwork put through. It re-enacts the
old rates of from 3d. to 7d. on personal exer-
tion, ■ and double those imposts on property,
but on incomes above £BOO a super-tax of
from 10 to 25 per cent, of the amount of the
assessment is to be levied. A man with £520
a year will get off with £2 2s. 6d if he is
married and has two children, while a man
similarly situated who has £BOl will have to
shell out nearly eight times as much. There
are numerous pleasantries like that.
The final session of the present Tasmanian
Parliament ended amid the smoke of battle
and the clash of tongues, the reckless old
gentlemen of the “Lords” having precipi-
tated another “Constitutional Crisis” by seri-
ously amending the Land and Income Taxa-
tion Bill at the last moment. Premier
Lyons did his best to induce Another Place
to reconsider its position, but the furious
Elders either couldn’t hear or wouldn’t listen,
So the bill will go to. Government House
without the Council’s* approval, and the
chances are that it will receive the Assent
as readily as did the Appropriation Bill,
The general elections should happen about
March ; and the anomalous position of the
Council is bound to have a lot of attention.

„ The strained relations that existed in the
N. S. Wales Ministry at the end of the ses-
sion illustrate again the absurdity of our
present system of party government. The
troubl ° was all about giving free railway
passes to a few more people ; and because
t l\° 0r tb J\ ee Ministers didnt agree with the
°, ers on the subject, it was doubtful whether
they could or should remain in the Ministry,
Of course Ministers don’t really agree with
half the things other Ministers do; but they
have to pretend to. The system simply breeds
humbug mid insincerity,
A movement has begun in Tasmania to
exact a pledge from every Federal member
that he will devote his whole soul to the aboli-
tion or radical amendment of the Navigation
Act. A recent example of the working of
that clumsy statute was the attempt to ship a
consignment of large timber from Tasmania
to Melbourne. None of the regular vessels
was large enough, and then a Yankee craft
became available. But Captain Jonathan
Washington hurriedly withdrew from the con-
tegt_h(f learned tha [ he would have to ship
dou jj] e hi s present number of sailors, pay in-
creased rates, and to a great extent rebuild
hj s vessel. For one goldarned trip, he said,
it was hardly worth while,
From 1636 to 1853 Japan cut herself off
fj-om the world In the latter vear an im-
portunate Yankee squadron butted through
j ier isolation, and in 1873 her first commer-
cja] co was f orme( j_ j n October, 1924, she
did £i 6 ,000,000 worth of business with the
wor j d that wouldn’t leave her alone, and
there was a small balance in favor of ex-
ports. During her seclusion it was criminal
f or a Japanese to build an ocean-going
craft; her latest naval programme is a bid
for supremacy in the Pacific with the nation
which stin . od up the hornefs nest . Tim
League of Nations should be asked to apply
penalties (they call them “sanctions” in the
new argot) to anybody who attempts to dis-
turb the repose of the next Asiatic people
who “go hermit.”
Latest returns show that the German ex-
ports to Japan, China, the Dutch East In-
dies and India were 30 per cent, greater in
1923 than in 1913. Last year Japan im-
ported 60,000,000 dollars’ worth of German
goods and India 37,000,000 dollars. Japan
in 1923 got twice as much German machinery
as in 1913, and three times as much aniline
dye. At least one Australian tourist a week
returns to tell us that the defeated nation
is as busy internally as she is externally;
the victor countries complain of the shy-
ness of trade and the scarcity of jobs. And
those who still insist that Germany must pay
vast sums in reparations must be prepared to
see her busy. In the next war, incompetent
generals will be at a premium, and the
admiral who sinks his own fleet first may be
the national hero.
Dr. Argyle, the Victorian Chief Secretary,
didn’t allow the grass to grow under his feet
when he got the report of Kelley, P.M., on
the administration of the Ivew idiot asylum.
He sacked Myers, O’Grady and McDuff,
warders who had stirred up the muddy
waters ; transferred the too-zealous Dr. Ellery
to the Sunbury institution ; relieved Dr. J. T.
Hollow, superintendent at Ivew, of the duty
of supervising the idiot asylum, and inci-
dentally wiped out his £5O a year allowance;
scattered three attendants among other
asylums; and directed structural improve-
ments to be made at a cost of £BOOO. Tunne-
cliffe, Argyle’s predecessor, took up the cud-
gels for the dismissed warders, but only
Snowball left the Ministerial side to vote
with Labor’s 27 on a test motion, and
Argyle had a majority of five.
Before it went home for its Christmas fowl
the Federal Government decided that itwill de-
cide not later than next June whether to extend
the present narrow gauge Port Augusta-
Oodnadatta line to a dead end in the south
of the N. Territory, and further aggravate
the mixed-gauge evil, or to start afresh for
the said dead end, possibly along a better
route, with a 4ft. Bsin. line. Later it will
decide when it will start. Later still, if the
stars are propitious, it will start. In course
of time, unless it stops, it will arrive at its
dead end, and then it may possibly fix a time
for considering what would be a favorable
moment to resume the work and progress
further, but not too much further all at once.
Eggleston and Argyle felt so limp after
the Compo Cabinet’s surrender to the Uppah
Chambah’s pressure for the reduction of the
income-tax schedule that it would not have
taken much to have goaded them into resigna-
tion. On reflection it probably occurred to
them that they would be scarified more for
quitting than for staying. • Argyle will go
ahead with his schemes for health, asylum,
prison and police reforms, and will not show
the meekness that Matt Baird did when
McPliairson ruled the roost as Treasurer.
If he can’t get the coin—deficit or no ‘deficit
—he won’t remain. A caretaker’s job is no
good to him.
A. C. Willis, who, as president of the N.
S. Wales A.L.P. executive, has shown un-
usual. tenacity in the campaign against the
selection-ballot brigadiers, is resigning his
presidential job, being after the party nomi-
nation for Macquarie. Macquarie is one of
the seats which Federal Labor expects to
regain next jmar; but it is always an un-
certain quantity. The erratic Sam Nicholls
wrested it from E. S. Carr in 1917 by nine
votes in a poll of 27,123. He lost it to
A. G. Manning in 1922 by 85 votes, the
total being 21,675. On these figures, allow-
ing for the swing of the pendulum which
occasionally forgets to swing, the odds are
in favor of the Labor candidate, unless he
shows more interest in the races than in
affairs of State, as Nicholls did. Still, Man-
ning is an active member with the gift of
forceful speech, and he will take a deal of
shifting.
George A. Taylor, of Sydney, just re-
turned from looking into the four corners of
the earth, thinks the world’s greatest danger
is a clash of the colored races and the white.
“In India,” he says, “within less than a fort-
night’s journey of Australia, in the slums and
disease-hatching quarters, there is a seething
cauldron of human discontent” ; and he pro-
poses to remove it by—town-planning ! Cer-
tainly towns ought to be planned, as well as
wars and cocktails, but town-planning is no
panacea. The creation of residential para-
dises results in the people that can’t afford
them moving out and the people that can
afford them moving in. So, as a means of
general uplift, the method fails; in fact, in
America the most elegantly-planned centres
are usually those with the most congested
slums.
Lloyd George has come to life again with
a new plea. Land values, he says, are the
real cause of England’s social evils, and it is
“the privileged, legalised avarice of land-
owners” that is responsible for the hideous
congestion and misery of the great cities.
Of course “the legalised avarice” of land-
owners helps, and so does the legalised
avarice of lawyers; also the avarice of whelk
vendors and saveloy salesmen. But people
who have lived on a Pacific island and paid
no rent have also been horribly poor and so
congested that they have eaten one another.
The whole explanation was that they didn’t
do much work; and Britain would also be
horribly poor if, sticking to Freetrade, it
didn’t do much work, even though it hanged
every landlord it owns.

For the men who remembered well!
For the men who clung when the rest had swung
With the ebb of the turning tide—
Stand up, stand up, you Diggers, stand up
For the sake of their splendid pride!
For the men as true as a mate to you,
Who true as a mate are yet,
Stand up, stand up, you Diggers, stand up
For the men who couldn’t forget—
Up, up, stand up, you Diggers, stand up
For the men who remember yet!

“Tuart”: The Official History of Britain’s
part in the war, dealing with the campaigns
in Mesopotamia, reveals that when the situa-
tion became desperate at Kut-el-Amara
Townshend, “on the authority of the War
Office,” offered the Turkish commander
£1,000,000, and then £2,000,000, to let the
garrison go free on parole. These remark-
able negotiations must have been begun a
month or two after the last British soldier
left Gallipoli, and I am afraid the story will
revive doubts as to whether the evacuation
was dinkum. There are Diggers who will
never be convinced that the Army of the
Peninsula could have got away scathless with-
out some connivance on the part of the enemy,
skilfully as the operation was planned and
carried out. Of course, history swarms with
instances of intrigues similar to the Kut
affaii*. To go no further back than the wars
of the first French Republic and Empire,
there was a reference in Robespierre’s papers,

“Don't fret about it, dear. Cats have their advantages—they have
nine lives.”
found after his execution, to Merlin, “cele-
brated for the capitulation of Mayence, and
more than suspected of having received the
price.” And Wellington, as Napier indicates,
had an understanding with a treasonable
society in Soult’s anny, and that at a time
when Napoleon’s empire seemed builded on
a rock.

“Double F.”: The answer to “Iford’s”
question as to whe-
ther there are Irish
or any other fami-
lies who have the
right to spell their
names w T ith an
opening “ff” (B.
11/12/’24) is sup-
plied by a footnote
i n “ Whitaker’s
Directory of Titled
Persons” (1924).
That authority
mentions that a
few famil i e s
Frenches, Farring-
tons and Finches
are cited as in-
stances —still affect
the “-ff,” but points
out that it is a mis-
taken use in print
of a icritten form
of capital F, which
was in almost uni-
versal use up to the
early part of last
century. In fact,
it would seem, the
ancestor of every
Briton or Irishman
whose names be-
gins with F once
wrote the letter
(assuming that he
could write) as an
intertwined “ff”;
the practice sur-
vived in engrossed
leases and legal
documents almost
up to Victorian
times —it is said to
be a relic of media;-
val script. A few
of the F’s, finding
their names writ-
ten thus in old
documents, have
endeavored to per-
petuate the “ff” in
print as a sort of
guarantee of the
antiquity of their
stock, whereas of
course it is no-
thing of the kind.
“Kcppel”: One more flood, and probably
Leichhardt’s tree, where the Comet and
Nogoa rivers unite to form the Mackenzie,
will be lost to Queensland. Successive floods
have encroached and washed away nearly
all the soil from the roots, until the tree's
own weight is liable to make it fall. The
letters forming the word “DIG” are now very
indistinct —the “D,” in fact, is gone altogether
—while the “L” representing “Leichhardt” is
grown over. The tree is dead arql the timber
vei’y rotten; wind will probably cause its
downfall if floods spare it. It has put up a
good fight in the 70 years since Leichhardt
passed there and made it a landmark. Could
not it be supported in some way ?
“Boui-agi”: The Australian Museum (Syd-
ney) has a new ambition : it wants to set
up 12 groups of
aborigines, repre-
senting as many of
the principal tribes
known to the early
settlers in Aus-
tralia. The idea is
to show the black-
fellow in his habit
as he lived before
the white man’s
“culture” arrived.
Weapons, utensils,
dwellings and all
the paraphernalia
of primitive abori-
ginal life are to be
reproduced, and
the figures them-
selves will be true
to life in color,
anatomy and equip-
ment. Since even
modern science
shies at the motion
of a stuffed abori-
ginal family, the
groups are to con-
sist of models and
actual casts taken
from aboriginal sit-
ters. This will
cost a lot of money,
but the value of
the project to
future genera-
tions will be incalculable. Ernest Wunder-
lich has already presented one group. The
Museum trustees are now looking for 11 like
him.
“Light Horse”: “1.L.1.’5” reminiscences
of the Dead Sea (B. 18/12/’24) recall the
story told me by a bx-other-iu-arms of a
launch trip to the end of the brine lake oppo-
site the Jordan’s inlet. The water there is
much salter than where the river empties,
TO FIT THE CRIME.
“What was the point of having your hair shingled and then
getting a hat like that?”
“You silly! If I hadn't had my hair shingled how could I have
got a hat like this on?”
and the launch rose so high out of its natural
element that the screw could not engage.
Things looked blue, for the voyagers were
unable to move, and the place is, lonely and
desolate. It was A.I.F. resourcefulness that
came to their rescue. One of the party
climbed over the side, and, though he sank
nearly to his ankles in the amazing sea, man-
aged to press all his weight on the stern of
the launch. This depressed it enough to let
the screw bite, and they soon got out of
the danger zone.
“The Rumpus”: I boarded the trail? to
Perth just after the Egyptian steamer Ama-
zonia had spilled out her assortment of
human cargo on the Fremantle wharf. Op-
posite us sat two of the Gyppo’s late pas-
sengers, evidently Italians, and during a lull
my friend asked if they came from that
country. Both stared blankly, and Brown
had recourse to sign language. He went
through the process of shovelling imaginary
macaroni down his neck in interrogative
fashion. At this form of query the pair
smiled comprehendingly, and one of them
replied by lifting an imaginary pint of beer,
emptying the contents and looking into the
empty glass. The other interpreted. “We
da blanka Australian now!” he said.

“Ex-Dig”: Victory Christmas in London
was an experience to be remembered. The
whole nation was in that semi-sozzled condi-
tion which causes a man to swear that his
wife is a dear lil’ woman and in the future
he will not give her cause for a moment’s
pain ; also it had an idea that it was on the
threshold of a new era, in which employees
and employers were to be brothei-s. Practi-
cally every public utility came to a standstill
after noon, to enable its servants to spend
their Christmas Day in their own home circle.
From the A.I.F. point of view it was a day
upon which England had resolved to make
the A.I.F. eat. The ration regulations had
been relaxed, and there was so much turkey
that it turned up as fricassee in the Y.
Emmas for a* week later. Having dodged
several invitations to spend Christmas with
relatives and friends, and more with warm-
hearted strangers, I went to lend a hand at
the Anzac Buffet, in accordance with a
promise of mine; but there wex*e so many
volunteers that it soon became clear my help
was only wanted with a knife and fork.
Escaping from there, I was waylaid by the
wife of a parson who had lent the basement
of his Horseferry-road church for the Aus-
tralian Y.M.C.A. (it was the best Y. Emma
in all London), and forced to eat another
dinner. In a subsequent walk it seemed as
if people associated with all the various
Soldiers’ Huts and Y. Emmas were lying in
wait, and as they all declared that they
would be offended unless at least a glass of
wine or a cup of tea and some cake was
consumed with them, and, furthermore, as
acquaintances with whisky bottles were to be
met at every turn, it proved a strenuous
afternoon. I don’t know at what hour I re-
tired as a casualty; but I had no interest in
tea that night or breakfast next morning, and
a very slight one in the lunch which I faced
at noon.

“The Country Parson”: It is not always
the creditor who is surprised by the long
memory of the casual Australian (B.
18/12/T4). Recently, on the old South
Creek coaching road (St. Mary’s, N.S.W.),
a big car paused for petrol. The oldest in-
habitant, who had hobbled up, was casting a
meditative eye over the machine, when some-
thing appeared to stir up an old memory, and
he hurriedly drew the portly owner aside. In
the dialogue that followed there were hot
words, accompanied by some violent ges-
ticulation ; and presently the stranger was
observed to unhook a large roll of notes and
peel off a liberal issue. As a young man
the motorist had left an unliquidated bill at
the store the ancient was then running; and
after the lapse of years the creditor had
caught the defaulter almost on the scene of
his defalcation !

“Nakhoda”: The mythopoetic faculty finds
room for exercise even in this new land.
South Aus. assembles devoutly round a fine
old bent gum-tree near Glenelg on December
28 every year, and believes it is standing on
the site where Governor Hindmarsh pro-
claimed the province in 1836. But hear
Mary Thomas, a pioneer ancestor of mine,
who as long ago as 1857 appealed against the
pious claim. “It had been proposed,” she
says in some private memoirs, “that his Ex-
cellency the Governor (Sir Richard Mac-
donnell) should affix a plate to the tree....
I doubted whether the identical tree was still
standing, and if it was, I was curious to
know how the inhabitants of Glenelg (few,
if any, of whom could have been present at.
the proclamation) could point it out.. . .and
the place itself so much altered in the course
of 21 years as scarcely to retain a feature of
its former wild state. While gazing about,
a woman from one of the cottages, guessing
perhaps what we were looking for, came to
us, and, pointing to the old decayed trunk,
gravely told us that was the tree where the
Proclamation had taken place. ‘That the
tree!’ I exclaimed, ‘I am certain it is not.’
She, as well as some others present, was
evidently disconcerted.... and she asked me
if I was present at the Proclamation, to
which I replied that I was, and all my
family. Moreover, I could positively assert
that the old tree at the front of those cot-
TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING.
“That cook of yours was priceless. Why
did you get rid of her?”
“I put on eight pounds in two weeks, so I
recommended her to my dearest enemy.”
tages was at a considerable distance from the
spot where the colony was proclaimed. Under
it my children played, calling it ‘Temple
Bar,’ from its similarity to an arch. How
it came to be distinguished as the ‘Proclama-
tion Tree’ I cannot tell, unless for the singu-
larity of its appearance.” Even then, how-
ever, romantic fable triumphed over sordid
fact and “the plate was affixed to the old
tree by the Governor, though there were some
present who disputed as to its being the
true one. The identical tree where the Pro-
clamation took place was cut down, I believe,
long before,” says Mary Thomas.

OUR CROWNING GLORY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The police are the outward and visible sign ot
the British Constitution, and the N.S.W. police force
is the best in the world.” —Governor de Chair.
Of pride we are full for our wheat and our wool;
Our women set senses awhirl,
From the maritime kind on the beaches reclined
To the musical comedy girl;
We are proud of our commerce and crops,
Of our Harbor, our flats and our shops,
But I think you’ll agree
With Dudley de C.
We’re proudest of all of our cops.
With triumph we glow to think we can show
The world such a swimmer as “Boy,”
While our cricketers’ skill is sufficient to fill
The barrackers’ bosoms with joy.
We have ’bailers the surest of drops,
And pugs who can flourish their “props”
For all they are worth,
But where else upon earth
Can you match our magnificent cops?
Some orators drag in the Crown or the Flag
As the handiest symbol and sign ,
Of the freedom that’s born in the race we adorn,
The order and law of our line.
But the flipper street traffic that stops,
The foot to the whistle that hops,
Bring home to all eyes
The rights that we prize
Rest foremost and first upon cops.
We have statesmen a few, and aldermen, too,
Who stand out, you may say, from the crowd ;
Of the show that was made by our khaki brigade,
The deeds of our Diggers, we’re proud.
There is juice in our steaks and our chops,
And jip in our malt and our hops;
But we proudly esteem
One distinction supreme—
We bang all creation in cops.

“Sixenate”: Memories of Jerry Cruncher’s
resentment at the prayerfulness of his help-
mate were revived in Melbourne the other
day when a man charged at a suburban court
with having administered corporal punish-
ment to his wife boldly pleaded justification.
The sharer of his joys and sorrows, he de-
clared, had trained the kids to flop on their
knees and loudly fire their petitions to
Heaven whenever he happened to arrive home
late; and he considerd it a grievance war-
ranting reprisals that they should be taught
to ask the Almighty to teach father not to
waste his time and money in the pubs, and
not be a wicked man with barmaids. His
protests being ignored, his wrath boiled over
one night, and, considering that the children
were not to blame, he distributed retribution
in the responsible quarter. The Bench showed
its sense by merely administering an admoni-
tion ; one of the J’s.P. even went as<tar as
to tell the wife that she was lucky to have
escaped with such light correction.

“Kyvcr”: Speaking of war Christmases, I
remember a more than tolerable one I spent
in gaol in 1916. A.W.L. from Wareliam
Convalescent Camp, two cobbers and I wan-
dered from pub to pub in Bournemouth.
Being full of Bass, we sighted a party of
our enemies, the Military Police. We
promptly attacked, but were outnumbered,
overpowered and duly lodged in a police cell,
there being no military clink in this salubri-
ous seaport. We awoke Christmas morning
in a full “Peter.” There were five Aus-
sies, two Irish Tommies who had deserted
their regiment, and a Scotch bluejacket.
UNSPLENDID ISOLATION.
ERMYNTRUDE: “Oh, Bobby dear, wouldn’t it
be just too scrumptious if only we could
be those two darting little stars all
alone by ourselves in a corner of
Heaven?”
BOBBY: “No bally fear (Oop! Glugg!).
Each of those little stars is separated
from the next by millions of miles!”
The idea of Christmas in gaol was depressing
us until the policemen, who condemned the
“Jacks” for clinking us on Christmas Eve,
clubbed together and bought us a gallon of
draught beer. We had hardly got this down
when another constable returned from point
duty with a fistful of money. As Diggers
passed he had halted them and made
known our plight, and without exception they
had bunged in a few shillings each, to be
expended in solacing our captivity. The
collection totalled £4 17s. Our good-natured
custodians obligingly “ran the rabbit” for
us as often as we needed; the sergeant’s
wife’s contribution to the menu was a plum-
pudding and a huge apple-pie. Yes, I have
spent a lot less festive Yules.

“The Deacon” : Let me re-assure “Boronia,”
who expresses a fear (B. IS/12/’24) that the
REVELATION.
HIS FIANCE : “Ok, John, I was afraid it was you!”
good old days of the bush M.C. lustily deliver-
ing his directions are over. Quite recently
I was in the Blue Mountains country
(N.S.W.), only a few miles off the main
Western-road, and a regular “hop” was in
progress. The couples arrived as of yore,
the hurricane-lamp still doing duty either
for pairs afoot or for hanging amidships from
the sulky axle, and the M.C. himself, nobly
attired in a white sweater and well-oiled
locks, still intoned the old orders, “Swing
to partners,” “Another couple here” and the
rest, of it. Certainly a few of the younger
set did tentatively indulge in a few jazz
steps whilst the more mature fanned them-
selves or had a quiet pipe outside ; but
Othello’s occupation gone—not a bit of it!
“W. J. Digger’s” summer morning:—
A magpie warbled in the branches of a gum-
tree, and his song floated in through the open
window; the gardener of my affluent neighbor de-
sisted for a moment from his arduous labors to whistle
an octave of “Horsey, Get Your Tail Bobbed” ; the
maid was in the parlor trying some new records,
and my heroine, utterly discouraged and distracted,
wilted and died beneath my hand. What she would
have said to the villain who had lured her to his
rocky fastness will never be known : the tongue th ir
was to have lashed him to homicidal fury will
remain silent for ever. I put down my pen and lit
a cigarette.. . .The baker’s cart stopped in the lane;
through the window I saw the baker fill his pockets
with my oranges, and I heard his care-free whistle ere
he smote merrily upon the back door. The maid
left Caruso with his engine running while she
answered the summons with “Two, please, and ’arf
a loaf of brown.” The tenor took a steep pinch on
top gear, causing intense vibration of the sound-box,
and a look of satisfaction flooded the features of
the food-purveyor. “’E takes that note pretty fair,”
he conceded; “and I oughter know, seein’ it’s outer
me own re-per-tor.”
* * * *
“F.T.Iv.”: Let me add my quota to the
list of unusual occupations of clerics before
they turned their collars round (B.
18/12/’24). Among the clergy officiating
in the Commonwealth I know of three, still
under 85 years of age, who exchanged their
respective jobs of tram-conductor, slieet-
metal worker and time-payment collector for
the surplice. Yet another one, a wharf-
laborer, took to the pulpit before Tom Walsh
started agitating, and a fifth combined
brewery accountancy with his divinity
studies. A grocer’s assistant and a railway fire-
man are now laboring in the vineyard, while
another abandoned his pots and pans as
a kitchenman and now wears liis stole with
high scholastic honors. And here are the
two most startling cases of all: one paid
his way into orders with the cash he won
in a Tatt.’s sweep, and another who forged
a cheque became a parson, made reparation
and then betook himself to the Heaven he
preached in and out of season.

“Country Ped”: Children are forget-
ting how to play. Going or gone
are the old games, heirs of the ages
—“oranges and lemons,” “drop the
handkerchief,” “twos and threes,” “nuts
in May,” and the like. In some schools
tops and marbles are very seldom seen, and
little girls eschew dolls. Some cannot even
play skipping games—don’t know how.
Rounders —well, they play it when compelled
to ; and I wonder if that is not the cause of
the lack of enthusiasm for it. Right from
the time children enter school at the kinder-
garten stage, teachers are planning games for
them. Organised games are a part of the
curriculum for physical training, and I have
noticed that any game that has been thus
organised is no longer played spontaneously
by children. It looks as if teachers in try-
ing to teach children how to play have only
succeeded in doing the opposite.

“FY7” : Casual husbands we have had in
plenty, but the Sydney Divorce Court re-
vealed the other
day that the other
party can be in
that category, too.
A petitioner told
the Court that,
after four years of
uneventful matri-
mony, he returned
home from work
one evening and
found his wife
gone, without ex-
planation unless
the infant offspring
of the marriage,
which lay yelling
on the floor, could
be taken as one.
For a long time he
devoted his week-
ends to searching
for the truant;
then he found her
address and wrote
to her. She was
living with her
mother, and replied
that she had no
other reason for
leaving than that
she was fed up; and the matter stands at
that.
* * * #
“Hasen”: He wasn’t rich (liis threadbare
coat attested that), but he was resource-
ful. I noticed that he had just left a tram
ahead before he joined our own sixpenny-
special Cricket Ground car bound for the
Test match. He boarded it at the end re-
mote from the busy conductor. We had
gone three blocks before the conductor
reached him and refused to accept the two
coppers he offered. He pointed out, reason-
ably enough, that he wished to travel only
one section. The conductor replied, also rea-
sonably, that it was a special tram and the
fare sixpence. Then he reasonably got off.
Something prompted me to look back, and
I watched him long enough to see him board
the next sixpenny-special Cricket Ground
car. Then I understood. By always ten-
dering his twopence and always having it
refused he was travelling to the Test match,
spasmodically but quite cheaply, by a series
of trams. An hour later I saw him watching
Hobbs intently, and I'm still sick with the
disappointment of not knowing what parti-
cular bit of resourcefulness he used to get
through a two-shilling entrance-gate. But
I’m open to wager he still has the twopence.
* * * *
“J.G.” : The old method of detecting- male
or female impersonators by dropping some-
thing in the lap of the suspected person to
see whether he or she will jamb the knees
together or spread them out (readers of
Mark Twain may remember that Huck Finn
fell before this test) seems to have lost its
utility. The other day, when in a Mel-
bourne ’bus, I accidentally dropped some sil-
ver. I was standing up, while a trousered
conductress was having a rest on one of the
seats, where she involuntarily intercepted the
descent of a coin or two. But, instead of
spreading her knees out, she brought them
sharply together, caught my currency, and re-
stored it to me. It shows how a few months
in trousers will change a habit. I wonder
if the habit will stay changed when the ’bus
girls discard them for skirts.
“C.P.S.”: Where there is only a deputy-
C.P.S.—generally the sergeant of police or a
constable—rthe Bench has to take down the
depositions, for the deputy-C.P.S. (in N. S.
Wales, at any rate) is barred from that
duty. When the P.M. is present he of course
undertakes the task, and the P.M.’s “fist” can
be worse than any J.P.’s. A man had been
committed on a charge of horse-stealing, and
the depositions were sent on in the usual
course to the Clerk of the Peace. A few
days later they were returned with a letter
asking if his Worship would be good enough
to decipher the hieroglyphics marked on a
sheet of the evidence, and following the words
“a blind man named Johnson.” The P.M.
came to me in mingled grief and indignation,
seeking sympathy. “Too bad! Too bad !” he
exclaimed. “The thing is as plain as a pike-
How could any man possibly make it
a blind man named Johnson’? There it is
for any fool to read—‘a black mare branded
SN over Y.’ ”

_"Ex-D. Despite official reluctance to
admit it, the N.S.W. finger-print system is
by no means infallible. When the Irish-
American Joe Wilson was hanged for th-
murder of the George-street Greek restaui an -
keeper Pappegeorgi, the bureau took ail tm
credit. None the less it was common gossip
in the underworld, and also in the umtormcc
force, that Wilson’s prints were tying 111 tn ®
bureau all the time that the C.I.D. was
vainly endeavoring to decide whose were the
marks they had found on the cash-registei.
It was not until a prisoner in Goa l burn
turned “shelf” that the experts were abie
positively to determine that the cash-register
print tallied with the official one of Wilson.
Comparisons made during the first week ot
the hunt for Pappegeorgi’s slayer had tailed
to establish that the marks were identical,
although the bureau prints are very thorough
ones, including the impress of every finger
as well as the thumbs.

“Corso”: An amusing instance of proposed
“vicarious sacrifice” came before me when
I was wielding the cane at a small school
out west in N. S. Wales. A. new boy
arrived one morning with this note: —
Please, sur, my little boy is very deliket, as he is
getin’ over a fit “of ploorisey, but if he is bold, an’ I
know he will, beat the boy next to him and that’ll
frighten him.

“T. 0.1.”: Of the hundreds of motorists
who scorch up Lapstone Hill, beyond Emu
Plains (N.S.W.), I wonder how many know
they are crossing the first stone bridge built:
in Australia. Sir Thomas Mitchell, in his
inaugural address as president of Sydney
School of Arts, paid a tribute to the builder.
He said :—■
In first scaling the heights of Australia Felix a
house carpenter was to me, in a small way, what
Tullius was to Julius Caesar in his passage into Gaul.
Wheelwrights and blacksmiths were my best soldiers
on the banks of the Murray. In building bridges in
the infant colony there were great difficulties until
I lighted upon a mechanic who was then employed
on day wages, cutting the coping stone of the dwarf
wall in front of the Council Chambers in Macquarie-
strect. Mr. David Lennox left his stone wall at my
request, and with his sleeves still tucked up came
with me to my office and undertook to plan the
stone bridges we required, make the centring for
arches, and carry on such works by directing and
instructing the common laborers then at the dis-
posal of the Government. Thus originated all
the bridges this colony possesses worthy of the name.
The first of his handiwork still spans a gully
at Lapstone Hill. When it was nearing com-
pletion, Governor Bourke, asked what should
be placed on the keystone beside the date,
promptly replied, “The name of the builder.”
“David Lennox” and “1833” may still be read
there.

A trifle daring and a shade uncertain,

With slender fingers curiously knocking
Upon the New Year’s door,
What will the future bring of joy and laughter?
Tears like a grey cloud which must follow after
Sorrows untold ?

A soupgon of the tawdry and the tragic,
Gems and the glint of gold ?
intriguing fashions that are quite entrancing,
A round of jazz teas with strange steps for dancing,
New books, fresh shows,
Swift sports, gay codes—convention still defying- -
A little malice and a little lying?
Who cares? Who knows?
Before the shimmer of the satin curtain,
A trifle daring and a shade uncertain,
Alert, alive,
Miss Twenty-four, as her last moment passes,
Cries “Cheerio, good friends, come raise your glasses!
Here’s Nineteen-twenty-five!”

NEW YEAR EXERCISES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
N.S.W.
If by tinkering and wedging
The thing that is me,
I could make more of living
And find the world fairer,
My soul would be giving
A cheque to the bearer
As large as the sea.
But the fresh lOU
That the New Year may dare
Has always come due
When my pocket was bare;
And my creditor being
My conscience, I knew
There was no way of seeing
My bankruptcy through
Except to deny
That I ever had signed it,
And frame a new lie
With some more lies to bind it.
Yet the nice job of making
And dodging and breaking
The best resolution
Is a good exercise
Much employed by the wise
For the soul’s constitution.

Kauri Timber did well to show an increased
profit last year, for the term was one of
anxiety for most traders in this line.
Prices of imported timbers fell at the pro-
ducing centres, which meant _ that stocks,
notably Oregon, had to be written back to
replacement values, which in turn meant in-
roads into profits where it did not mean
actual loss. Then, so far as Sydney was
concerned, traders were mixed up in a price
war which was of little value to anyone,
although offering temporary benefit to builders.
The S p.c. div. to most shareholders is some-
what better than it looks, for 255. of capital
was issued in the 1920 reconstruction for
every 15s. in the old co. The co. is not
neglecting contingencies: it has big freehold
and leasehold forests, and much depends on
the value of the standing timber. Combined
the holdings appear in the books at £266,801.
But wader-valuation of timber assets was
certainly a feature in one part of the con-
cern’s history and may be now. Formed in
1888, the co. limped along for 10 years, when
it was deemed necessary to clip 7s. from each of
the 600,000 £2 shares on account of “capi-
tal lost or unrepresented by assets.” Un-
earned increment is, however, always working
for holders of kauri, and after the lapse of
another 10 years, the co., as the result of
another valuation, wrote the timber assets
up by £382,510, turning a deficit into sub-
stantial reserves; and they have continued
to grow, notwithstanding that large amounts
have been struck off the forest assets. The
nature of these reserves is shown in this: —

Some look like specific reserves, but at the
1923 meeting the directors included the lot in
their estimate of shareholders’ funds. The
next comparison shows gross profits and
charges:—

Apart from the freehold and leasehold forests
and plant the co. sits behind a tidy little
£665,528 net; and the capital is only
£750,000. Further, in view of the small
existing supplies of kauri and the impossi-
bility of materially increasing them within
the next 50 years, the forests are probably
worth all their book value. The position, so
far as capital is concerned, is therefore very
strong, though the average visible earnings
are nothing to make a song about. A fur-
ther return of capital looks to be one of the
probabilities of the next few years: the last
line in the list of assets given above points
that way.

Sun Newspapers (Melbourne), Ltd.:—
Starting a modern paper is, under any cir-
cumstances, expensive. Starting a paper in
competition with one which has been long
established calls for a very deep purse. Sun
Newspaper (Melbourne). Ltd., which pub-
lishes the Sun News Pictorial and the
Evening Sun, was founded by Sun News-
papers, Ltd., of Sydney. In 1922 the un-
issued capital of the parent co. was placed
among shareholders in order that payments
for the Melbourne venture could be met, and
when the first issue of the Pictorial ap-
peared (Sept. 11, 1922) the whole of the
ordinary capital was held by that co., and
much of the £99.995 of 8 p.c. prefs. by its
individual shareholders. The parent co.'s
accounts that year showed that “invest-
ments” had moved from £28,614 to £152,476,
which entry covered the cost of tho Melbourne
venture that far. Last year ordinary capital
in Melbourne Sun, Ltd., was £300,005, and
“investments” in the parent’s accounts had
moved to £302.466. Whatever outside money
is in the Melbourne concern appears to be
chiefly in the prefs., but it cannot be of any
great volume. This table covers operations
from the start: —
1922 1923. 1924.

The first term covers a period of eight
months from formation to the day before
the issue of the Pictorial. To Sept. 29,
1923 (the Evening Sltn was launched on
April 4), a trading loss of £35,651 was
shown, and last year a further loss of
£26,178. But during the past year £16,985
was added to the establishment account,
which means that the year’s outgoings were
£43,163 greater than the revenue. As, how-
ever, the Pictorial is “now thoroughly
established as a substantial profit-earner,”
there is some justification in refusing to
regard the excess outgoings as wholly a loss.
The Evening Sun has still an unknown
distance to go before it can show a profit,
but the directors “have good reason now to
expect that the coming year will show an
aggregate profit in the co.’s operations,” and
if it does all hands will be entitled to give
themselves three cheers —they might even be
justified in making it beers. As the prefs.
will then have to be attended to
(the 8 p.c. is cumulative, and they
were issued in October, 1922), _ the
parent co. may still have to do a little
waiting. But on present appearances what
they will get will he worth waiting for. East
year, though two papers were being estab-
lished, the excess outgoings were £43,163,
whereas in the previous year, with only one
in hand, the excess was £41,611, a pretty
good indication that the stiff fight is going
the right way. Meantime the parent co. is
at least getting this benefit —having the two
Melbourne papers to share the cost of its
cables, it can give a far better service than
it could otherwise afford to do; and that
certainly brings grist to its mill in Sydney.

This little co. has earned the kind word. It
was a clean float, to begin with. 11. B. Car-
penter, who had been one of the Queensland
Insurance Co.’s managers, joined with his
brothers, who had been in the Island trade
and had handled insurance, and together they
invited people who wanted insurance cover
to come in and share in the profits from their
own business. The response was fairly satis-
factory; and. working, on this semi-co-opera-
tive basis, the cost of getting a certain
amount of business has been, for a young co.,
unusually low. Progress is, however, slug-
gish.; and it will continue so if the directors
stick to their present very good policy of mak-
ing each year’s revenue carry the whole of
the business-extension outlay. They are not
helped by the loss rate, which so far has been
very heavy. This table shows the under-
writing experience from the outset ;—-

Nor is it likely that the loss rate will shrink
very much; Islands losses always have been
heavy. However, if the co. can keep its
capital intact, it will do very well if it adds
even a few thousands a year to its net pre-
miums. So far its position is thoroughly
sound: —

Every penny of paid capital is there, and
in addition £1772 over and above a sufficient
reserve for unexpired risks. The bulk of it
is in public securities: the only line about
which there might be some doubt is “Loans
secured at short call and other investments,
£10,923.” Interest earnings were £1934, or
within -n few pounds of the dividend. Share-
holders have not much' to hope for in the
way of an early rise in the div. rate; and in
the circumstances they have no right to ex-
pect more. Policy-holders, are amply pro-
tected.

This is the fourth consecutive 5 p.c. div., but
it is the first that has been earned. Since
1920 nominal reserves have been drawn on
for £4552; last year’s surplus profit added
£127. The co. purchased the world’s rights
of the Premier Totalisator invented by G.
A. Julius, and a big portion of the co.’s capi-
tal is in the intangible “patent rights,” which
is bunched with totallsators, plant, pre-pay-
ments, etc., £178,127.” That big goodwill de-
pended on the sale of patent rights; and,
although so far business has not come up to
expectations, the rights are still worth some-
thing. The co. has placed machines in most
of the Australian-States, in Maoriland, a
couple in Ceylon, and one in a London club,
and is trying to sell the franchise in various
parts of the world. The co.’s efforts in
England and France have had most unsatis-
factory results. Immediate prospects in
England are indeed considered so hopeless
that the Board decided that the expense of
a special representative was unjustified.
France has, likewise, proved a difficult
problem, and the French syndicate which had
been given an option is considered barren of
hope, wherefore other steps are to be taken in
that country. A contract has been placed for
the installation of two machines at Bombay,
and negotiations are proceeding with clubs in
various parts—with prospects of success, the
directors think. No further installations
were made in Australia during the term, but
revenue from machines was the best thus far
recorded. _ Nominal capital was increased by
the. creation of 50,000 prefs., but they wiil
be issued only when it is necessary for the
' co. to partly finance installations.’ Sundry
debtors were reduced from £33,644 to £23,532.
This substantial liquidation resulted from
new agreements with several N. S. Wales
clubs. The prospects improve, of course,
with _ each machine placed, but the way of
the inventor is generally hard and always
uncertain, and there is not likely to be
much in it for shareholders until substantial
business has been done in disposing of foreign
rights, so that the amount represented by the
intangible, assets may be replaced by some-
thing which can earn money. Here is a
comparison of balance-sheet movements since
the promotion of the co.

It was the smallest profit since 19lS, and the
always cautious Board dropped the div. on
ordinaries from 14 to 12 p.c. But you
never can tell just what the real profits have
been. This year, for instance, though some
depreciation has certainly been provided for
otherwise, the directors paid £10,620 out of
profits l —or, at any rate, out of revenue—for
renewals and replacements. Probably some
additions to plant, etc., were made during'
the year ; if they were they, too, were charged
up to working exes,; and at the same time
the book value of the item was reduced from
£331,936 to £323,252. But that's a way
this co. has always had. Baronet George
Clifford is the chairman and heavily inter-
ested ; and in Maoriland Clifford is another
name for solidity. The next table illus-
trates that

So in the nine years only £40,924 of tho
additions to plant, including freezing works
and very considerable holdings of land, has
been charged up to capital account; the
balance, as well as all renewals and replace-
ments, has been provided out of earnings,
and the co. was pretty busy in that matter
during the early war years. But that is
not the most remarkable performance of this
money-spinner. Between 1915 and the
present only £16,700 of capital has been got
in (there u r ere a few pounds extra in pre-
miums, certainly) ; yet, after all the addi-
tions to fixed property and all the replace-
ments have been paid for, the excess of
stocks, book debts and other more or less
liquid assets over liabilities has grown by
£68,742. Visible reserves are now substanti-
ally more than the capital (£212,500) ; and
as £lOO,OOO of the capital carries only 6 p.c.,
it is not surprising that the balance of ordi-
nary capital can earn pretty fat dividends,
though the phenomenal price for wool
doesn’t make things easy for the freezer,
prospects, except for labor troubles, tend to
improve all the time. American influences
have stood in the way in Britain hitherto;
but John Bull is slowly realising that if ho
wants strong sons to stand by him, he can't
afford to feed his sons’ rivals.

£112,500. But the catastrophe which would
compel soundly-established trustee cos. to
drag in uncalled capital would probably be
so big as to make that uncalled capital—and
all capital—of small value. Prospects for
shareholders are bright enough. The only
variations in the 10 p.c. div. from 1910 on-
wards was in 1915 when it was lifted to 12
p.c.; and, assuming profits are maintained
and divs. are not increased, the reserves are
still substantial enough to bear periodic ex-
cursions for bonus scrip. Even with the
latest capitalisation total funds have to earn
only p.c. to pay the* div., leaving ordinary
business earnings to provide the additions to
reserves.

The Fourth Victoria stands in a class apart
from other building societies because of its
relationship to the National Mutual. The
life office is chief shareholder in this society,
and one of its directors and its general man-
ager are on the Board. This relationship
insures substantial and stable deposits, and
enables it to make advances with confidence.
While others have been extending their busi-
ness very slowly in these later years of high
deposit rates, the Fourth Victoria has
gone ahead briskly in spite of high cost of
building-trade labor and material and inflated
land values. The rapid increase in the past

Building societies have never quite lived
down the bad name they made for them-
selves in the mad years about 1890, when
conditions seemed to conspire to wreck them.
Money was poured in from abroad, and the
obsessed financiers of the day accepted it
though it w r as liable to be called for almost
at a moment’s notice. In the' struggle to
earn interest on it securities were accepted
without proper margins; and when the tide
turned societies found themselves with far
tpo large a proportion of new advances on
which few repayments had been made. They
saw 7 the slender margins rapidly disappear;
and when the foreign and other creditors
pressed, of course there w r as trouble. The
modern building society doesn’t deserve to
have to go on living under the old cloud.
They are almost without exception in the
hands of men experienced in finance; they
are not dependent at all on foreign deposits;
their local deposits are very small in pro-
portion to their own funds; and the pro-
portion of new advances on their books at
any time is small and the margins therefore
comparatively w 7 ide. They are distinctly
useful institutions; they are capable of per-
forming a valuable service not only to the
individual but also to the State, for in these
days of social unrest the more people that
can be encouraged to practise thrift and
settle themselves in their own homes the
better. The State Savings Banks when they
set up departments to assist house-builders
did the building societies no good, of course;
but there is ample room for both agencies,
and the time has come to bring the benefits
of the private institutions more prominently
before the public eye..

Original shareholders in the liquidating
Associated Gold Mines (W.A.) haven’t done
badly. Between 1896, the year of flotation,
and 1914 they received, in addition to 275.
6d. for every pound invested, interests in
the Associated Northern, Lake View South,
Lake View 7 Extended and Iveeley. Now
Associated holders are to receive an inter-
est in the new co. which is being formed to
acquire the old Associated mine at Kalgoor-
lie, and also one in the concern which is to
take over Associated’s other assets. These
consist of 474,636 dollar shares in the Keeley
Silver Mines, Ltd., 327,674 dollar shares in
the Vipond Consolidated, 11,800 paid and
20,000 partly-paid £1 shares in the Huon
Belt and 91,113 Associated Northerns.
Hampton Properties, Ltd., announces that,
w 7 ith Hampton Gold Areas, Ltd., it has
backed the reconstruction of the Celebration,
and that sufficient capital will be provided
to go deeper. Prospects at the 400 ft. level
of the Celebration mine on Block 50.
Hampton Plains (W.A.), are declared
to be encouraging, and the hope is
expressed that they will continue so
or improve lower down. Something is also
said about the Hampton Properties mine on
Block 45, which so far, like the Celebration,
has been a disappointment. This property
w 7 as recently inspected by Vail, manager of
the Lake View 7 and Star, who reports that
if certain developmental work at and above
200 ft. level is done the “risk of loss should
be extremely small and the probability of
profit hopeful.”

Some of the small, hard-up Adelaide cos.
that rushed to Ivan Jones’s gold find at Mt.
Grey (W.A.) a few months ago and rushed
aw 7 ay a little later may be sorry they left.
In a report the Inspector of Mines claims
that the field is a valuable one and is likely
to furnish good returns. He says he panned
off samples from several holdings which indi-
cated that the reefs w 7 ould pay with a mill
on the spot. The nearest battery is 50 miles
aw 7 ay, so only rich ore is of any use at pre-
sent.
* * * *
Tarcoola Blocks Co., wdiich in the last
few 7 years has tried and failed to get a mine
in Westralia, is turning its attention to lead
in that State. Its new address’is Northamp-
ton. north of Geraldton. Lead shows are
in the boom just now: the market is said to
be very bare’ of supplies. But there are
lots of known sources of supply.
Canadian papers are talking a lot about
Keeley silver-mines, Ontario, in which
Associated (W.A.) is interested. The Mon-
treal Financtat. Times says;—
Keeley Mines has been the sensation of Canadian
silver mining of the past two years. Last year
this new producer earned 26 per cent, on its stock,
and is paying divs. at the rate of 24 per cent, per
annum. It has built up a surplus of over 1,000,000
dollars, is strong in working assets, and is as yet
in the initial stages of development. In its under-
ground workings new rich shoots of ore are being
opened up in quick succession. Evidently its pros-
perous life has just begun. 7 ':
But don’t expect it to go on indefinitely.
As they are wrnrked nowadays silver-mines
are short-lived propositions. Their best
hope is that, instead of petering out. they
will turn into something else —as Broken
Hill did.
* * * *
Fre.iey Oil Co., which lately absorbed Okes
Durack’s interests, has issued another cheer-
ful circular to shareholders. Bitumen,
globules of oil, etc., have certainly been met
at various depths in the bore during the past
year; but the co.’s optimism is not shared
by the market.
* * * *
copper Separation, Ltd., (W.A.), has had
many difficulties during the past year. Some
time’ ago the co., after a hard struggle to
raise additional capital, induced an Adel-
aide syndicate to purchase 3500 £1 shares at
par, and then got the Westralian Govern-
ment to lend it £4OOO. Most of this money
has been spent on a plant at Phillips River,
which, after several delays, is about to treat
dumps of gold and copper ore and residues
there. The co. has also arranged to instal
its process on the Whim Well copper-mine,
Roeburne, as soon as the Phillips River
plant has proved a success.
* * * *
Although Queensland is the only State
that will show an increase in gold produc-
tion for the year just closed, the position is
fictitious, for without the assistance of the
Treasury the northern State’s production
would be in a parlous condition. Nit. Morgan
copper-gold ore is responsible for about 79
p.c. of the total gold yield, and had not the
Government come to the aid of tlie miners
employed by the co. when the copper market
slumped production would almost certainly
have ceased. The Mount’s cut is generally
arranged to run 5000 oz. to 60900 z. monthly,
so that, in an annual yield that will not
touch the 100,000 oz. mark, it is easily seen
how little is left to represent all the others.
A legitimate increase may be expected, how-
ever, when, and if, large scale operations are
undertaken at Mt. Coolon.
* * * *
Mt. Mulligan State colliery (N.Q.), which
supplies Chillagoe smelters and has been the
standby of N. Queensland during shipping
strikes, is looking unhealthy as far as future
reserves are concerned. Three of the prin-
cipal working faces have been abandoned
owing to shrinkage of the seam and faulting,
and it is a case of looking in other directions
for almost immediate supplies. An effort
will be made to test the lower unworked seam,
but prospects there are not particularly pro-
mising. Chillagoe is now connected direct
with the Bowen State colliery, and any
amount of coking coal can be obtained there;
but if Mt. Mulligan fails, an expensive min-
ing and coking plant will have to be sacri-
ficed, and another heavy State loss written
off.
* * * *
Finney’s Hill United, the silver-lead show
that was discovered some years ago in one
of the residential suburbs of Brisbane, has
reached the profit-making stage, so share-
holders were informed at the annual meeting.
The co. has had to contend with numerous
difficulties, as the ore-body extended through
various freeholds and under roads, and the
Queensland mining laws have not provided
for mining under such conditions. These
difficulties, however, have now been over-
come. The output amounts to over 500 bags
of concentrates per week, and is likely to be
increased. Should the metals remain at any-
thing like present figures, the co. should have
a good run.
* * # *
Daylesford mostly wrestles with forma-
tion or with quartz that works out at 6dwt.
or under from which no divs. can be squeezed.
Ajax has dropped into the doldrums after
its last flutter and the bear squeeze which
drove most of the solid side of the Room out
of the stock. Now the programme is to go
for another flat make at a shallow depth, for
little below 700 ft. at the field is worth blast-
ing. Ajax North is trying to prove the con-
trary, for its biggest shoots are from No. 7 to
No. 9 ; but anything going to the battery
yields a profit only to the miner. Still
the new Eastern lode may provide a sur-
prise, as it carries a little gold with the
country and pyrites. Prospecting elsewhere
at Daylesford is not revealing more than
the usual mixture, but great things are hoped
for at the old Cornish now 7 that the water is
out.
* * * #
Bendigo’s yield for 1924 is the lowest in
its history, being only 25,9180 z than
one of the old giants of the district used to
give in six months. As 1923 saw an output
of 44,0250 z. the drop is nearly 50 p.c. The
balance-sheet of the field is disheartening.
Calls were £22,486, dividends £13,500. The
only two shows that raised a smile among
their followers were Hercules, with £9OOO of
divs., and New Red, White and Blue, with
£4500. Such a showing tells the wdiole story.
No one goes on paying for development if
nothing is to be got back. Till finds are
made on the sidelines the outlook must be
dismal. The district optimist holds that Her-
cules is to save the situation. It has the big
reef at 1520 ft. to open up, with the assurance
that a very little enriching of the stone would
result in a fine run of divs. South, the
Ironbark is on the same make of stone, and
it may help to liven up things. Then a lot
hangs on New Red, White and Blue, as a
big stretch of undeveloped ground on the line
of reef woifld at once come into the market
if developments in the big mine looked up.
Of outside shows there is lots of talk of Car-
slialton, in which Adelaide lost a pot of money
years ago. That and a return to shallow
mining in some of the old mines embrace the
prospects of the district. The trouble will
be to get in calls until finds are made.
* * * *
The second monthly clean-up from Brib-
baree (N.S.W.) gave 3210 z. from 135 tons,
compared with 3590 z. from 180 tons in the
initial effort. Thus, while the average im-
proved, the tonnage suffered. Compared
with other N. S. Wales gold bantlings, Brib-
baree has at least given something tangible
to support the prospectus on which the float
was effected. Doubtless on the principle of
striking while the iron is hot, an £BO,OOO co.
in ss. shares is on the stocks to exploit a pup
euphemistically labelled the Bonanza Brib-
baree. The area is 25 acres, and the vendor
J. H. King, of Nawng Pet, Takuapa and
other tin concerns. He will receive the
30,000 vendors’ paid to 55., and the 50,000
contribs. paid to 2s. are offered for public sub-
scription. According to a report by mana-
ger W. H. Williams, of Bribbaree, there are
two shafts on the lease, No. 1 being 45ft.
vertical, and No. 2 down 102 ft. A depth
of 129 ft. has been reached by a winze from
a crosscut off the shaft bottom. “Short
levels opened from the winze at the bottom
disclose 35 inches of ore worth 30dwt., and
thus the deepest point shows the best values,
as in Bribbaree. At the surface the stone
was worth only sdwt.,” says Williams—and
then he estimates “average values of the
property” at 15dwt. He believes the. lode to
be the same as that in the Bribbaree. though
the main shafts and the two leases are
1000 ft. apart. There is no report from A. -
P. Penman, who recommended the other.
* * *
Christmas Gift. Cullinga (N.S.W.), put
364 tons through the battery for 27Soz. of
£3 gold. It sounds good; but “bunchy”
makes are still the predominant feature of
the mine. v
* * * *
Having eaten up its £3OOO of subscribed
capital in unwatering a shaft and- discover-,
ing dangerous running ground at the bottom,
Bora Silver-Lead Development Co. (N.S.W.)
applied without avail to the Mines Depart-
ment for assistance. The over-optimism of
C. 11. Kerry and Aubrey Bartlett thus re-
ceived a setback. George Blakemoro and
others shook their heads at the beginning;
but Bartlett thought that, after three weeks’
bal l g. he would be bn a rich sulphide lode
at 276 ft., the spot where water and sludge
drove Robert Sands out. A circular to
shareholders now informs them that “rich
sulphide ore with a value of over £3O a ton
exists at the 200 ft. level in isolated bands,
with indications of these increasing with
depth to form a solid centre core in the lode.”
Shareholders were asked to decide whether to
bore to 600 ft. to see whether it is worth
chancing another £4OOO to sink a new main
shaft to similar depth, but the general atti-
tude was reflected in an attendance of only
two on the meeting date. And as two wasn’t
a quorum, the state of suspended animation
continues.
* * * *
The Christmas clean-up at Grown,
Mudgee (N.S.W.), gave only 950 z. from 74ti
tons. It was a disastrous drop from the
first 350 tons for 1440 z.; and it came right
on top of an announcement, that the main
reef had split in two, one half striking to
the north-east and the other to the south.
The question naturally arises as to what
part of the mine the 2oz. to 3oz. stuff came
from on which the gaudy float was
made. The shares paid to 7s. 6d. are mar-
ketable precariously at about 6d., and on
present appearances shareholders will have
to make levies on themselves to keep the bat-
tery working.
* * * *
Strike talk continues at Broken Hill. The
Iron Trades Unions asked for 2s. per day to
bring them level with the carpenters, who there-
upon immediately demanded a 4s. increase.
The Miners’ and Engined river s’ Unions have
also put in a substantial log with a threat
at the end of it. Meanwhile, lead is oyer
£4O, the three big mines are developing well,
and the tonnages are as high as, the. scar-
city of miners will permit. B. H. South in-
tends sinking a new main shaft to serve the
southern ore bodies. This will hurry on pro-
duction and cheapen costs, and ultimately be-
come the main shaft for the whole mine.
* * * *
Barrier Silver Lead Co. was told in 1922
that it had a property which would make
history—nothing but the Prop, had ever seen
such rich ore at such shallow depth. Old
Broken Hill hands smiled —they had heard
that yarn so often. Now the customary
thing has happened. After sinking 100 ft.
and cross-cutting 4ft. they got formation but
no ore; and manager J, Miller and engineer
J. Wheeler pronounced the show a dud. So
the cash-box has been closed down so quickly
and definitely that deb. holders don’t even
get December interest.
Last six months’ campaign at Adelong
Crock (N.S.W.) ended in 28700 z. being
sifted from 326,0Q0 cub. yds. The gold
brought in £12,340 and left a net amount
of £4730 to provide a div. of Is. Ground
averaged 5.427 d. and costs were 5.592 d. a
yd. Ahead is a lean patch of drift and
then beyond lies 74d. ground, which means
that more profits are in view. But the
area left is limited.
* * * *
To June 30 last S. Aus. had paid State
mining subsidies amounting to £65,103. Of
that, amount £13,227 has been recovered and
£2250 written off. According to the terms
of the grants repayments are to be made from
profits, 50 p.c. to be set aside for the pur-
pose. In only two instances has payment
been completed: Crystal mine, Echunga,
£76; and New Alma and Victoria, £3OOO
(first subsidy). Other recoveries have been,
in the main, from sales of plant, and some
°f the outstanding debt js represented by
machinery now in the Government’s hands.
But the apparent loss hasn’t been all real
loss: the State got some indirect benefit from
the metals won.

Labor in Victoria is mournipg J. W.
Billson, deputy-leader of the State Parlia-
mentary party, who was laid to rest in Box
Hill Cemetery last week. For months he
suffered severely from cancer of the stomach,
and the House saw little of him since June.
Premier Allan, with reason, described him
as the ablest man on the Opposition (Labor)
side. At his best he was a keen debater,
never missing a point, and he could show up
the weak features of a bill in a way that
made the authors squirm. He was at his
best as acting-Opposition leader while Elms-
lie was away at Hawaii nine years ago. In
Elmslie’s short-lived Government he was
Railway Minister (1913), and he could have
had any post he liked in the last Labor
Administration had he not been ill. Un-
questionably he was one of Labor’s best pro-
ducts. Fitzroy recognised the fact by re-
turning him 12 times in succession in 24
years.
A strong sense of humor helped to make
political life pleasant for Will Hutchinson,
who died at East Malvern (Vic.) the other
day, after 18 years in the Assembly, dur-
ing seven of which he was Minister in three
Governments. A departmental top-notcher
brought him the news that Hugh McKenzie
had threatened to resign from the Peacock
Cabinet over Clause 69 of the Land Act re-
lating to “spotted” titles. Hutchinson
grinned and said that he was reminded of the
yarn of the man riding in the Irish ja’ntin’
car. When the horse bolted, he offered the
driver five bob to pull up and let him alight.
“Be aisy, me jewel, and you’ll get out for
nothin’ in a jiffy,” replied Mike. And so it
happened—within a month or two the Minis-
try got its tumble and McKenzie fell out of
both Ministry and House.
After controlling the Vic. Factories, Shops,
Lifts and Servants’ Registry Branch for l 4
years, H. M. Murphy has retired. When
Harrison Ord was killed by being thrown
from his horse in 1910, Murphy, then a P.M.,
was induced to become his successor. It was
an uphill job, but Murphy had a genius for
organisation, and so well did he order things
that, notwithstanding all its ramifications, the
net cost of his department to the taxpayers
is only £BOOO a year. In the last few years
he has been styled Sec. of Labor, and lately
drew £llOO a year. He narrowly missed
being made Chief of Police in 1917, and he
nibbled for a week or two at the Northern
Territory Administratorship, and then gave it
the go-by. He does not intend to loaf away
the rest of his life, but has no desire to follow
his late dad and become an M.L.C. If he lives
till he reaches his late mother’s age (95) he
will draw a tidy bit in pension at £6OO a
year. M. H. Stevens, his understudy, will be
his successor.
Some distinguished visitors have dropped in
by invitation at Auckland : the Tofua brought
as guests of the Government eight Samoan
Faipules, or representatives of the Samoan
people in the native Parliament. This is
the first time M.L. has largely entertained
the chiefs of her new dependency, and, as
matters went off quite pleasantly, it is hoped
the affair will have the result of oiling the
wheels of the administration in Samoa.
Another chief arrived, but as he merely
stowed away to see what happened, his fate
was an appearance at court and an early
passage home.
“Pip Tok”: The Speck’s new figurehead,
whom an old-age pensioner in Perth sought
unsuccessfully to claim as his son, on the
strength of some data regarding his E,x.’s
career which appeared in the W.A. papers,
should be popular at Hobart. He combines
dignity with an ability to tickle the ears of
the groundlings, which last he did aboard the
Drama by addressing the third-class passen-
gers as “Fellow immigrants.” During the
war the O’Grady held a captain’s commis-
sion in the Munster Fusiliers, but, being too
old for France, was employed as a recruiting-
officer in Ireland. It was almost safer to be
at the Front.
Sir Matthew Nathan, Bananaland’s Gov-
ernor, is in his last year of office, and when
he leaves he will be missed greatly in the
State’s little art circle. Besides giving a
general sort of encouragement he has a
pleasant habit which artists hope will
spread: instead of presenting an orthodox
wedding present to Queensland brides, he
has given them water-colors and sketches of
Queensland scenes. W. Bustard has been fre-
quently favored; at least four pictures of his
are hanging in English homes through Sir
Matt.’s agency.
H. S. BAILEY, member for Port Fairy,
whom a wing of the party would like to
see follow the late lamented Billson as
deputy-leader of Vic. Parliamentary
Labor.
Heavyweight Teddy Warde, Labor mem-
ber for Flemington, continues to relieve the
tedium of the Vic. Assembly’s proceedings
with whimsical suggestions. The other day,
when Pollard and Cook, two Labor members,
were rebuked for shedding their coats. Warde
asked Speaker Bowser whether, if McPliair-
son came in kilts, would he be in order. It
was a poser for Bowser, who hails from
Haggisland himself.
Adelaide Uni., at its annual commemora-
tion, welcomed the two new agricul-
tural professors, the home-grown A. E.
V. Richardson and Prescott, of Man-
chester and Egypt. “Gar” Hone, the
inter-State tennis-player, took a degree in
medicine, and L. T. Gunn, the cricketer, took
his in law. The annual address was en-
trusted to Kerr Grant, Professor of Physics,
and he gave a Wells-like forecast of “things
unattempted yet”—communication with the
moon, a permanent observatory on Mount
Everest and a 12-mile shaft towards the
centre of the earth to tap the central heat
as a motive power.
One of the best-known men of North
Bananaland, Donald Miller, died at Bowen
the other day, aged 82. A typical Scot, he
landed in Rockhampton when just out of his
teens, and worked as a tailor. Then he went
north and started storekeeping and pioneer-
ing. He was a fine all-round sport, promi-
nent especially in athletics, and a foundation
member of the Bowen Turf Club. Incidentally,
he invented a starting-gate, the power being
provided by a cross-cut saw which was pulled
back and let go suddenly. He often rode
as an amateur in Members’ Cups with
success, and was the captain of the Bowen
Kangaroo Hunt Club, which had weekly runs
until the ’roos began to get scarce.
Fred Johns, the author of that remark-
able book of records, “Who’s Who in Aus-
tralia,” can claim a record of his own. Dur-
ing the 11 sessions he has been leader of S.A.
Hansard staff lie has not missed a single
sitting. His aggregate absence from the
sacred precincts in 10$ years while the
Assembly was sitting does not amount to
three hours.
The head of St. Mark’s, the new (and
first) residential college in connection
with Adelaide University, is to be A.
Grenfell Price, who was chosen from a
long list of appli-
cants. He was
educated at St.
Peter’s School, and
has been a master
there ever since he
came back from
Oxford. Geography,
on which lie has
written several
clever books, is his
specialty. He is
only 32, and takes
a keen interest in
sport.

A former Australian rabbi lias just died
in Jerusalem at the age of 84. Abraham
Aeber Ilirchchpwitz 30 years ago was one of
the identities of Melbourne, where he estab-
lished and rabbied the Beth Hemidrasli
Ilagedoul. Later he went to Sydney, and
then had a big charge in America. He was
regarded as one of the weightiest authorities
on Jewish law and the Talmud ; and when
at the age of SO he was pensioned by his
New York congregation, he went to Pales-
tine with the idea of having his disputations
published in the land of his ancestors, which
is developing a Hebrew literary renaissance.
Captain Bean, in his second volume of
the Official War History of Australia, grate-
fully reproduces a raised model of the Anzac
sections in Gallipoli. The model, which is
in Justice Ferguson’s chambers at the Syd-
ney Supreme Court, gives a wonderfully clear
idea of the tremendous difficulties that con-
fronted “our boys” at the Landing: it pic-
tures ridge and crest, valley and ravine, in a
way no cartographer could do it. It is
worked out to scale with absolute accuracy ;
and from it one turns with amazement to
the modeller —the Judge himself.
W.A.’s first qualified woman architect was
recently registered. She is Margaret Pitt-
Morrison, and she completed her articles
with Eales and Cohen, in Perth. Her father
is George Pitt-Morrison, of the Museum and
Art Gallery.
Joseph Palmer, who recently retired from
the committee of the Sydney Stock Exchange,
learned the language of bulls and bears
when, at the age of 21, he entered one of
Sydney’s three then-existing stockbroking
offices in 1862. Six sales a week were about
the limit of ’Change transactions in those
days. Having founded a business of his own,
Palmer was first elected to the Exchange
committee just on 50 years ago. He has
been continuously a committeeman for 30
years, and several times he has used the
chairman’s gavel. Being still S 3 years young,
he intends to pop in at the office daily.
WM. MOORE, the veteran art critic of
Sydney.
George Mac Lean, the 35-year-old sec. to
Vic. Premier’s office, has thrown up his pub-
lic service job to take that of general sec. to
the Nat. Federation. As Mac Lean is Scotch
and shrewd, as well as energetic and re-
sourceful, he must have received solid mon-
etary and moral guai’antees of support before
deciding to change over. The story current
is that branches are to be formed everywhere
for Federal and State emergencies, including
the Upper House State elections in June.
That Lawson and Peacock pulled the strings
there can’t be much doubt.
Ex-Premier Harry Lawson (Vic.) has com-
pleted 25 years’ continuous service in the
Assembly. When he got in first he beat
Castlemaine. When he got in first he beat
Major-Gen. McCay at a by-election. McGay
had just been made Customs and Education
Minister by Allan McLean (1899), and had
to go before his constituents. McCay was
temporarily unpopular because (1) he had
opposed the sending of a contingent to South
Africa to take part in the campaign against
Kruger, and (2) had helped to upset Tur-
ner’s team. So Lawson triumphed, and has
held on ever since. The House has its eye
on him, and he may come again soon as its
pilot-in-cliief.
Redfern, Sydney’s busiest suburb, carries
its democratic opinions into practice:—
For the next 12 months the Chief Bumble will
be Pat Mooney, a burly red-haired tram-conductor.
Mooney \Jas a 1917 railway and tramway striker
and lost his position as a driver over the upheaval.
During the past seven years he has been in and
out of work a dozen times, has run a small mixed
grocery business and shovelled sand. He got back
to Fraser’s service a few months ago. Since 1920,
P. Roberts (hairdresser), G. Boyd (boilermaker)
and Jack Castles (tram-driver) have filled the
Mayoral chair: Castles never donned the rabbitskin
robes, but often inspected defective drainpipes in
his “trammie’s” uniform.
“Ex-M.P.”: If in its coping-stone ses-
sion next year the Fuller Government brings
in a measure for the issuing of railway
passes to those who have served as members
for three or more Parliaments, 35 people
will be able to hang the decoration on their
watch-chain. The number would be nearly
twice as great- but for the fact that many
three-Parliament men are still unbeaten, and
more are in the Upper House. Other three-
Parliament performers have also done four
years as Ministers, which at the present time
entitles them to a special medal good on
Australasian railways. Tommy Walker, pro-
minent in W.A. politics, although he repre-
sented coaly Northumberland for three short
Parliaments, is in no need of the bauble, as
his present pass is legal tender in N.S.W.
Should the measure go through, amongst
the 35 will be J. C. Watson, W. J. Fergu-
son, Varney Parkes and Neil Nielsen (the
Lands Minister that made trouble for the
McGowen Government). Harry Levien, who
represented Tamworth in 13 Parliaments,
will be the veteran of the squad.
Alf Edden will come next with 10 Parlia-
ments. Johnny Hawthorne, who was Whip
for the last Parkes Government, now close
to 80, is about the oldest in years.
Simon Hickey, entering the forties with four
Parliaments and a short Speakership behind
him, is the youngest.
THE BUILDERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They are pulling up the city, they are pulling down
the city,
Smiting at its deep foundations, tearing at its
dusty crown ;
They have scattered stone and mortar without any
sort of pity
For the people dodging traffic while they smash
the buildings down.
Standing on a ridge of ether, with his bowyangs
in the glitter
Ot the sun that, stooping westward, gilds the
wreckage in his fall,
One is chipping bricks beneath him with a motion
slow and bitter,
Which is token of his hatred for the cracked
and tottering wall.
They are hoisting up the city, they are dressing
down the city—
Lifting window, wall and turret, while they stroke
things soft with paint—
Making narrow wind-swept shadows ; and the builders
without pity
Hang their girders on the skyline, knowing noth-
ing of restraint
They are building up the city, they are tearing
down the city;
There is nothing keeping steady in the whole
brown mass of stone.
Though ten thousand hands are toiling and the
narrow ways are gritty
Nothing stays leng where they put it, for they
can’t leave well alone.
But the country—the broad country that is still
the true foundation —
Are they building that or merely making holes
in its design ?
They are building up the city. Arc they building
up the nation,
Or merely gently urging it to lift its head and
shine ?
There’s a chain across the sunset, which they lift
their strong steel, ties on,
And a toiler wrapped in glory dangles heavy
boots in air ;
But I’d rather see a humpy making smoke on the
liori.-n
At the edge of Baclc-o’-Sunset with its building
sites to spare.

NATURE’S HOARDING.
THE MAN WITH SOMETHING TO SELL: “Wonderful cliff, yes! But
nobody’s doin’ anything with it. D’ye think God sends
us cliffs like that to waste’?”
“Valamac” : Will some kind person tell us
how to prevent home-made bread from going “ropey”
in the summer-time? Most bush-wives in the Far
North and West experience this trouble during the
hot weather, the bread becoming sticky, fermented
and onlv fit for fowl-feed. This takes place either
two or' three days after baking, though in the
very muggv weather day-old bread is affected. Any-
one who provides the secret of prevention will earn
the heartfelt gratitude of thousands of bush folks
besides myself.
“Dingle”: In North Kimberley, right in >
the middle of Nowhere, one of our horses took ill 1
and refused to go further. Our united veterinary !
knowledge made no difference to Polly. We were 1
short of time, so left her with all the food we could
spare and pushed on for civilisation and more rations. !
In a few weeks’ time, our business completed, we
were back again, and pitched our tents as near as
we could remember to where we had left the invalid.
Rain had fallen, and when it rains in Kimberley it
rains. The country was hardly recognisable as
the barren waste we had left. The grass and under-
growth was a dense mass that took some getting
through. After a rest I set out to find her, dead
or alive. It was a hot, steamy day, and I was pretty
well winded, when I got on the scent of something
that made me wonder. Surely the old mare was
not guilty of such a perfume as that. I had never
smelled anything just like it, and I had been among
dead bush animals of all descriptions. I pushed on.
A few more steps and I saw, in a clear patch a
few yards in diameter, two niggers squatted under
a tree and rubbing their heads and bodies with
their hands as if life depended on it. I asked them
what game they had on, and they pointed above
their heads. Spread across the limbs of the tree
was a dead nigger. In life he had been fat, and
it was this fat that his brethren were making
use of. The sun’s heat was melting the oil out,
where the flesh had been cut open, and it was
trickling down on their heads and shoulders. They
were anointing their bones with it. Asked why, one
nigger replied: “Him Mundy up there! Him very
strong feller. This make me strong same that
feller Mundy.” I was satisfied about Mundy s
strength, and made for a sweeter atmosphere. In
doing so I stumbled on old Polly having a quiet
snooze in the shade, and rode her back to camp.
* * * *
“Akran”: I have seen some experts who
could do almost anything with a stockwhip, but the
best I clapped eyes on was one Dosey, a half-caste.
He was frail as a new-born chicken, with legs like
lawyer-canes, but had fairly big arms. His favorite
stunt was to lay the ace of diamonds on a stick
and with one flick take the diamond clean out with-
out disturbing the card. Chaps used to place pen-
nies on their top-pieces and let Dosey flick them
off. Once only I saw him miss, but heard after-
wards that the chap concerned had pommelled him
some years before, and evidently he hadn’t forgotten
it. When the penny was placed on the young
fellow’s head Dosey, instead of flicking it off, nicked
away half the ear. It went as an accident, but
Dosey still laughs when it is mentioned.
* * * *
“T. 0.1.”: Apropos “P.J.G.’s” complaint
about being ordered to spray with an arsenic mixture
Lr.it-trees laden with fruit (B. 11/12/’24). During
the late war a returned Digger got a farm and
orchard at Faulconbridge (N.S.W.). He procured
about a dozen fine dairy cows. He found the whole
herd dead one day. The cause of death was a
mystery until someone found out that he had been
spraying his fruit-trees and that the cows had been
in among them.
* * * ■ -— ... *
“E.S.S.” : I want to ask those Abos. who
are so cocksure that the crow is a- fiend among
sheep to state what
colored eyes their
crows have. It seems
to me that this is the
basis of the argument.
Australia has two
crows and a raven;
one of them is the
shor t-billed ero w,
which is so very rare
that it doesn’t matter.
The common crow has
hazel eyes, and is the
best feathered friend
that the sheepowner
has. Wherever there
is a rotting carcase the
hazel-eyes will be
found feeding on the
maggots, thus rendering
a valuable service in
checking the blowfly
pest. There is no other
bird in the country
that can adequately
take his place. In
many years’ experience
among sheep out back,
I never knew one of
them to molest a live
animal. But I have
seen the raven, which
is slightly bigger and
has white eyes, cling-
ing to the necks of
weak ewes and peeking
their eyes out. I have
also seen sheep walk-
ing about with bleed-
ing, empty sockets,
and ravens digging in-
to their backs. These
birds are generally
called white-eyed crows in the back country. This,
with careless observation, results in the confusion
ot friend and foe. # # #

Billy See : The wood of some \\ sttialian
gums seems to be saturated with acetic acid. When
machining green white-gum, the vinegary smell is
always in the air, and the shavings taste acid in
the mouth. Jamwood fills the mill with the smell
of crushed raspberries. Jarrah slabs have all sorts
of smells—some a delicate perfume, others are sour
and dank, as though the trees had gathered the
effluvium of swampy land and rotted undergrowth.
Sandalw'ood—but, of course, you know about the
Celestial favorite. She-oak has a dainty nutty aroma
which mingles well with that of cut tobacco. A
she-oak tobacco box is a gift for a king. But the
A GRAND MARCH WANTED.
“Who said you could play here, Jacko?”
“ Nobody, save.”
“Then you’ll have to accompany me.”
“Vis pleshure, save. What vill you sing?”
wood that caps the lot is native peppermint, which is
so full of pungent oil that a thimbleful of sawdust
will scent a whole press of linen.
* * * *
:“F. Clinton” : There is a remarkable differ-
ence between the behavior of a bird placed in front
of a mirror and a dog’s. I recently heard our green
Mexican parrot making a great noise. On investi-
gation I found that his cage had been set down in
front of .a big table mirror and he was doing his
utmost to persuade the parrot in the glass to swap
yarns. Subsequently I placed the mirror on the
lawn and found that a dove tried to chum up
with his own reflection. I tried the joke on a
terrier, but there was no taking him in. He simply
looked at it, sniffed and walked away. The reason
why the dog is not deceived lies in the fact that
his sense of smell tells him that there is no one
there. One sniff is enough for him. The bird, having
only sight to rely on, falls in every time.
* * C v * *
“A.A.”: An unusual sight may be seen
at Anderson’s Bay, about 25 miles from St. Helens
(Tas. j. Here a few days ago 77 whales were
stranded. They are small, measuring from 15
to 20 feet in length, and, being of the black variety,
are yf little commercial value. They were first
noticed by the lighthouse-keeper at Eddystone. It
believed that this is the greatest number of
whales ever washed up on the Tassie coast at one
time. Some years ago 37 sperm whales were stranded
on the n.-w. coast near Perkins Island, and were
worked by a syndicate at considerable profit.
“T.T.T.” : Tom McGrath, who threw away
a fortune in the shape of an oatmeal bag of Tas-
manian osmirldium (B. 20/11/’24), is not on his
own. About the same time Jim McGinty brought
from Long Plain to Heazlewood a pickle bottle
full of the metal. Finding it had no value, he
gave it to a friend, who in turn handed it to his
children to play with, and thought no more of the
matter until the despised metal became worth about
£lO per oz. Then he called the family together
and asked questions. All he could ascertain was
that the bottle had been broken in the scrub at the
back of the house. A general search followed, but
no sign of the missing bottle or its contents could
be found. Incidentally, McGinty is the man who
discovered at the Rock River the biggest nugget of
gold, weighing 281 b., the Speck has produced.
He was so excited at finding it that he packed his
swag and left the claim. Jim Griffin and party came
along the next day, and from the same crevice won
two other nuggets, weighing Blb. and 121 b. re-
spectively.
* * * *
“Parama”: “Centurion” (B. 4/12/’24)
must be drawing a long bow of another kind when
he speaks of New Guinea natives using bows of Bft.
Some time back while working west from the Fly, 1
had a fancy for souveniring one or two O.S. bows.
I told the “boys” what I was after, and my wants
were promptly “wirelessed” to the surrounding coun-
try. I also interviewed the head men of several
villages. Scores of bows resulted, but the longest
went only 75 inches. Six feet seems to be the
regulation length. The grip, or centre of the bow,
I found in all cases to measure lin. in thickness
and a fraction under 2in. wide. More are strung
with “cured” lawyer-cane than with rattan. The
arrow' shafts, which are unwinged, are always made
of reeds, in some instances being painted or dyed
red, black or yellow, according to the tribal fancy ;
and I’ve had first-hand evidence that hardwood
heads, barbed, edged and bulbed, are used for war as
much as for anything else. For pig they have a
special arrow with a split bamboo head, shaped
something like a cheese sampler, with razor-sharp
edges. This they loose off at piggy so as to dis-
embowel him. It takes months to cut, season, shape
and supple a bow properly, yet I’ve bought them
for three sticks of trade tobacco at 4d. per stick.
AN URGENT APPOINTMENT.
THE TOURIST: “How far is it to the next
puh?”
THE SWAGGIE: “’Bout five miles. Want to
see somebody there?”
THE TOURIST: “You let! I want to see
myself there.”
“Yarrum” : For the last week or so I’ve
been spelling among the grasshoppers in the North
(N.S.W.), and they are a terror. Yesterday a friend
rode down from his selection, and reported that his
crop of oats, seven acres, 4ft. high and in head, had
been eaten right out. Not a blade of his herbage,
except tarwine, remained. He told me that he
couldn’t ride through the grasshoppers at his place,
but had to get off and cut a passage with his
stockwhip. Before departing they squat upon the
ground, bore a hole some 4in. deep, and deposit
their eggs. The only plants that resist their ravages
are lucerne, tarwine, ripe wheat and, of course,
the prickly-pear. Up against a wire fence, 200yds.
from where I’m writing, tons of carcases of the pest
are stacked, and still they come.

NEW YEAR'S EVE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
To-night wherever bushmen meet
Old memories to renew,
By all the roads and routes and tracks
That wind Australia through,
They’ll spare a thought for old-time mates
Who met with grim mischance,
For some lie dead in Flanders,
And some lie dead in France.
They’ll think of New Year camp-fires lit
By creek and river-bend,
And all the roads and routes and tracks
That through Australia wend ;
And thinking thus of old-time mates
They shall have memories,
For some Rave left the bush behind,
And some have crossed the seas.
This New Year’s Eve dead fires shall shine,
Far memories re-glow,
By all the roads and routes and tracks
That through Australia go;
And, if there be a toast to drink.
Each man shall name his mate,
Though some be old and broken,
And some —God knows their fate!
To-night, wherever bushmen meet,
Though they be grave or gay,
On all the roads and routes and tracks
That through Australia stray—
That stray and stray through treeless plains
Or gumtrees, green and tall—
The past they shall remember,
Fine deeds and dreams recall.
They’ll think for sure of those who helped
With weary feet and backs
To carve and lay Australia’s roads
And make Australia’s tracks;
And, minded thus, to them shall come
The sad, yet glorious, thought
Of mates who starved and thirsted,
And mates who built and wrought.
To-night wherever bushmen meet
Old greetings to renew,
On all the roads and routes and tracks
That wind Australia through,
They’ll not forget the men who saved
Their land so fair, so fine,
Though some lie dead at Anzac,
And some in Palestine.

THIS TUDOR BATTERY, comprising 314
cells and capable of delivering 5332
amperes for one hour, was supplied to
the Sydney Municipal Council in 1915 for
their Phillip Street sub-station. The Council
has now placed a further order with the Tudor
Accumulator Co., Ltd., for the supply of a
still larger battery, comprising 300 cells and
capable of delivering 6696 amperes for one
hour, to be installed in the Castlereagh Street
sub-station.
This is another of the many cases all
over the world where Tudor Accumulators
have been chosen on account of their proved
reliability.
5832 Amperes per one hour.
TUDOR BATTERIES FOR COUNTRY-HOUSE LIGHTING have been adopted as standard
equipment for DELCO-LIGHT PLANTS supplied by
Messrs. Warburton, Franki, Ltd., Sydney.
„ Warburton, Franki, Ltd., Melbourne.
» Parsons & Robertson, Ltd., Adelaide.
Messrs. W. F. & E. A. Stewart, Launceston.
„ Smellies, Ltd., Brisbane.
and for LISTER-LITE PLANTS supplied by Messrs. Dangar, Gedye & Co., Ltd., Sydney.

“Quick, mister, give us a lemonade-bottle with a marble
stopper! Me ole man’s been celebratin' Christ-
mas an’ lost his glass-eye again!"
“Nitric” : A conscientious horse prevented
a robbery at Mt. Morgan (Q.) lately. Two men
broke into a shop and commandeered a horse and
cart from a neighboring place to carry off the
loot (valued at £100). They had hardly got Dobbin
into the cart when the sagacious animal began to
jib, also to neigh. The noise awakened the owner of
the stolen property and the robbers fled empty-
handed.
* * # #
“Morris”: Dogs drawing bakers’ hand-
carts and children’s carriages were common sights
in Belgium and Northern France, but it took the
Digger a long time to get used to the dog-wheel.
This was a light' frame contrivance about 7ft. in
diameter and 18in. wide, which registered one-dog-
power when Bruno was placed inside and induced
to chase himself, the power thus developed being used
to work the family churn. Bruno always came on
the job readily—he wasn’t fed until the butter
“came”—but when the good-wife went inside his
speed slackened to less than one mile a day. He
worked, however, with one eye on the dairy door,
and was going all out long before the missus could
reach him.
“Toongooroo”: “Centurion’s” remarks on
the partiality of Chinese in North Queensland for
a toothful of octopus inspired “Borum” (B. 27/11/’24)
to comment on a simi-
lar taste on the
part of the Levantines
which they seem to
leave behind when they
quit the shores of 'the
Middle Sea. Some-
thing similar can be
attributed to the
Britishers and others
of the Nordic races.
Take the case of the
rays. On the other
side they are conspicu-
ous articles of diet,
and all the markets
show a big sprinkling
of them every day. But
the North European
leaves his ray behind
when he comes to Aus-
tralia, just as Giovanni
or Leonidas turns from
his octopus. What
sound basis has our pre-
judice against the rays
and the sharks as food ?
The sharks eat a whole
lot besides men, and
the rays are just as
clean feeders as a
hundred other speci-
mens of the finny
tribe we rank high as
delicacies. All our
rays, including the so-
called shovel-nosed
sharks, are quite r;s
fussy about their grub
as the snapper and whiting which we consume daily.
“Wcssel”: One of the customs which dis-
tinguish the abo.< of Bathurst Island and Melville
Island (N.T.) from those of the rest of Australia is
that of putting up carved posts around their burying-
places. This habit is shared by two such remote
races as the Sakalava of Madagascar and the Tehuel-
ches of Patagonia. The Sakalava erect curiously
carved hardwood pillars 15ft. high over the graves of
their chiefs. A picture of one of these graves recalls
at once the abo. burial : ground near the mission
station on Bathurst Island.
“Vansittart”: Snakeskin shoes, or shoes
allegedly made of snakeskin, have become more or
less fashionable of late. But like some other fashions
it is only a return to the primitive or semi-primitive.
The so-called half-castes of Cape Barren Island, in
Bass Straits, who still preserve in a diluted form
the blood of the now extinct aborigines of Tasmania,
use on special occasions footwear made of snakeskins.
* * * *
“Colub” : A friend of mine owns a twelve-
months-old pup which is apparently im-
mune to snake venom, it having been
bitten at least 10 times without having
suffered the slightest ill-effects. Recently
the pup tackled a full-grown black
snake, and. during the scuffle that fol-
lowed was bitten twice, once on the
back of the neck and once on the fore-
paw. Such an experience would have
been sufficient to settle the ordinary dog,
but it did not make this one even sick.
He also seems to have specialised sense
for smelling out snakes, and once having
got on the track of the reptile will not
give up till he has found and killed it.
After the fight, whether he has been
bitten or not, he makes straight for the
nearest waterhole, plunges in and stays
there for a few minutes. He comes out
apparently in the best of condition.
That the immunity is not a chance one
towards one particular kind of snake is
clearly shown by the fact that at one
time and another he has been nipped
by black, brown and tiger snakes, death-
adders being the only variety with
which he has not come in contact. If
he can stand the venom of the three
varieties mentioned, he ought to be able
to stand that of the adder.
“0. Coral” : I’m glad to see that “Conger”
(B. 23/10/’24) vindicates Binghi’s reputation as a
sailor. I must dissent, however, on one point—that
“all the coloreds, with the exception of the .Tap,
must have the white man’s guiding voice and hand
at the helm in case of emergency.” Personally, from
what 1 know and have seen of the Japs, in N-.Q.
waters, I wouldn’t feel any too safe with them in a
big blow. In awkward situations they seem to lose
their heads, and I’ve seen them helplessly tangled up
amongst shipping in Thursday Island until directions
from a white man put things straight. On the
other hand, I’ve known a Torres Strait islander
stick to his tiller all day in a hurricane with no
white man to direct or encourage him.
“Calixto M.” : Seagulls are very partial to
sheep’s eyes, too. They cause much trouble in this
respect in Maoriland, and do great business during
lambing time, for it is only w’hen they can take
the woolly fellow at a disadvantage that they swoop
down. Another trick of the gulls is to stalk a
lambkin until he is too exhausted to move, and
then rip the carcase and sort out the tastiest por-
tions.
“C. Coral" : The legend of the lightning,
as narrated by Largod, one of the old-timers of
Coconut Island. Panipan, a beautiful girl, lived in
JUST NEIGHBORLY.
“Fancy ’er goin’ in for a planner. Style, eh!”
“Yus! We’ll be ’earing next, I suppose, that Melba’s coinin’
down to open it!”
olden days at Double Island (T.S.). She was
unmarried, and so handsome that all who looked
upon her succumbed to her charms. She bad many
suitors —the big tiger shark, the porpoise, the
big-headed turtle, the iguana, the rat, the snake, the
lizard, the small spotted blind shark, and others ; but
none found favor. At length they got together l and
said “We shall make a dance,” as is the cdstom
in the Strait when young men desire to show ,their
accomplishments before critical ladies, “and whoever
Panipan chooses will take her.” So the dance was
made and the big-headed turtle acted as drummer.
As they went through the figures, each one coming
from the rear line to the front and thrn returning,
Panipan gave no indication of pleasure or praise,
until Koomusar (the spotted shark) took his place.
Tnen Panipan smiled, her cheeks shone, her eyes
and white teeth glistened, till the smile gave place
to delighted laughter. The dance ceased and the
jealous competitors decided to fight Koomusar with
firesticks, stones and whatever came to hand, so
that on his body Koomusar still bears the black
spots where the firesticks caught him. Undefeated,
he and Panipan went into the bush, and the others
retired dejectedly. Presently the time came for
Panipan and Koomusar to part; and she said, “I
go to the nor’-west to stay, and every year, when
the big nor’-west wind (monsoon) comes, you will
know I am laughing and smiling at you.” “And
I,” said Koomusar, “go to my home in the deep,
but as I sail about you will see my tail darting and
waving out of the water. We shall not forget
each other.” “And I,” said Urza (the big-headed
turtle), “must go to my place also, but when 1
see Panipan smile I shall beat my big drum.” And
so up there in the Strait, Panipan, the lightning,
laughs from the nor’-west, and Urza beats his big
thunder drum; any day you will see Koomusar
swimming round flashing his tail to let Panipan
know he is there.
* * * *
“Boronia”: Out-back dwellers are great
hands at. devising substitutes. I have seen a violin
made entirely of local wood by a boy of 18. The
sinews of a kangaroo tail made efficient strings, while
the tail of old Blossom provided the hair for a bow.
The proud maker could coax out of it some very
decent music. Not long since I was shown another
instrument made out of tobacco tins carefully selected
to give a perfect octave. It was played with two
sticks and sounded much better than some of the
weird instruments in a jazz band. The best, though,
was an affair containing 1C alarm-clock bells. Tlk
maker had gone to infinite pains to obtain a true
chromatic scale by filing the metal. To hear the
music produced on this instrument by a shy, retiring-
son of the soil was a treat.
* * * *
“C.N.”: Can any Abo. beat my nomina-
tion for the prolific-mare stakes? A farmer of
Wool Bay (S.A.) has a mare that so far has 16
foalings to her credit. Bred in the purple, she
was purchased cheaply as a yearling filly at a clearing
sale. The lady’s owner says she is still sound and
next year will probably once more be a proud and
happy mother.
“R.M.P.”: Rc bush-baked bread (B.
27/11/’24). I was cooking 45 years ago on Peak
Downs station, and baked bread, making my yeast
out of wild hops. The result was pronounced to be
first-class by those who ate it, and it was still fit
for eating four days after baking. I also made
good hop beer, with a kick in it, from the same
native plant.
* * * *
“Lily-Beale”: A very unusual sight was
seen recently on Merri Merri, near Gulargambone
(N.S.W.). After the recent heavy rains hundreds
of seagulls invaded the creeks and lagoons of the
station. To convince unbelievers, several of the birds
were caught and brought into town for inspection.
Has anyone known these birds to ti'avel so far
inland, the locality being over 300 miles from
the sea ?
* * * *
“The Rumpus”: There are no more cer-
tain criers of the heavens’ intention to turn on the
water-tap than Westralia’s “wet weather'’ bird. He
is brown-hued like the dead leaves that fall to the
ground, and, except for his forecasting turn, is a
shy fellow who perches perfectly still in some low
tree-top. Throughout the wet season his mournful
cry is heard before the clouds are even seen. With
the last shower of the rainy season the dirge
(hanges to a whistle like that of a postman.
“Romax” : During last summer in Western
Queensland we were camped near a bower-birds
playground, and often had visitors from it. They
were particularly partial to sugar, jam or anything
else that was sweet; and any carelessness in leaving
small bright objects about necessitated a week-
end visit to the playground to recover stolen property.
One bird in particular possessed a very extensive
repertoire, and could imitate to perfection a sheep,
dog, cat, kitten, chicken and “ducky” hen; also the
crack of a stockwhip. His star turn, however, con-
sisted of sitting motionless in a tree outside the
mess-tent, while groups of “Happy Jacks” foraged
for scraps thrown out. Immediately they located
anything edible, the shrill whistling call of the kite-
hawk would sound above their noisy chatter, and
there would be a scurry for the skyline and safety.
The deceiver would then sweep to the ground, a
short distance from the morsel and advance to it in
a series of short hops, meantime laughing heartily in
perfect imitation of the jackass. This latter turn he
added to his list some little time after we invaded
his domain, and was doubtless suggested by our
hearty laughter at the deception practised by him
upon the other birds.
* * * *
“Gouger” : A chasing dingo will never leap
for an emu’s body. That would mean being kicked to
pieces by the annoyed owner. But he will spring
for the long thin neck, his weight bringing it
almost to the ground. The dragging dog jambs its
paws against logs and tufts of grass, back-pedalling
all it knows. In a very few minutes the big bird
comes over with a crash, its powerful legs furiously
clawing the air. Gradually the pedals slow down and
stop. The dingo’s grip never slackens until the
bird is throttled. Incidentally, a pack of dogs will
reserve the right to hunt over their own country
and hand out savage stoush to any poacher.
* * * *
“Fox”: How’s this for a white ant? She
is liin. long and about fin. through. She was
obtained from a rotten log where she lived with
ordinary-sized termites. Local authorities tell me
she is the queen and lays 60,000 eggs a day. Does
anyone know anything about it ? If the local pundits
are right, there should be one in every nest; yet
this is the first I have ever seen.
* * * #
“Moe”: Fishermen have lately been won-
dering whether there are not two distinct varieties
of Murray cod, each with its ow T n habitat, instead of
only one, as hitherto thought. The differentiation in
form and habits of large numbers of specimens has
frequently been noted, the fish coming from some
rivers being short and thick, whilst those found in
other streams are long and thin. As yet there is
scarcely any other evidence on which to go, and it
is quite likely that the differentiation is due to
environment. One fact that supports this is that
tne long kind of fish are found mostly in the
swifter-running streams, while the shorter are in
the slower and deeper rivers.
“ HOME, JAMES!”
“Corso” : The praying-mantis is my nomi-
nation fpr the most gluttonous insect. I have a
lady of the species in captivity. One day recently
she polished off two cicadas, two cockroaches (out-
sizes), one garden spider and numerous flies, and
then backed her cart in for more. In order to give
her company I hunted up a prospective hubby. The
honeymoon lasted a week; then in obedience to the
mantis marriage laws, she murdered hubby in cold
blood and devoured him in addition to her usual
meal allowance.
THE CALL OF THE COUNTRY TOWN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A cocky has leased his farm on shares
And has held a sale of his stock,
His household goods and the furniture.
His sheep were a splendid flock,
And his fine brood mares and his cows and calv'-s
Wore skins like a satin gown;
But the girls and his wife demanded life,
So they’re shifting into the town.
A hawker known at the out-back sheds
Has traded his tilted cart;
He has sold his load and left the road
And is making another start,
lie says that the hawker’s day is done,
So it’s time that he settled down,
lie will hang his sign in a busy street
On a little shop in the town.
They’re shifting into the township now—
Oh, the town is the place for life!
But the voice of the auctioneer struck deep
To the heart, like a butcher’s knife.
Oh, many a time will the hawker sigh
For the open-handed trade
Of the station camps and the shearers’ huts
Ere the rent and the rates are paid!
A bullocky in from the Warrego
Has leased out his tabletop
And twenty-four of the finest steers
That never a load could stop;
Twelve red roans on the off side yoked
And twelve on the near side, brown—-
He swapped the lot for a motor-truck,
And has shifted into the town.
They’re a stockman short on a western run.
A drover of wide repute,
Who’d manage a flock when floods were up
Or a drought laid bare the route,
Well known to men of a thousand flocks
And cattle-kings of renown,
Is driving a dray for the Council now
Since he drifted into the town.
A grey-haired couple have left the bush—
Old types of the pioneers.
Banks were good when the years were fat,
But interest got in arrears.
They rode the billows when fortune smiled,
But sank as they met her frown—
They live on the old-age pension now
In a shabby street in the town.
The grey-haired man and his wife will pine
And worry and fret in vain ;
But the men that came from road and run
Will take to the bush again.
There’ll come a day when they’ll go away
By an unfenced, winding track
Beyond the town as the sun goes down;
And never a man come back.
N.S.w.

Touring
Genuine balloon tires
Give Greater Riding Ease, Braking Efficiency, Shock Protection
With all the old-time Essex qualities of performance
and reliability, you now get: Full size, genuine
balloon tires—Added beauty and distinction
—Easier riding—Easier steering—Almost
double braking efficiency .
Naturally when balloon tires had established their
superiority Essex would adopt them. They are now
standard equipment. They add an even greater
measure of riding ease, steadiness and good looks to
the notable values of the Coach. With the advanced
system of spring suspension and low center of gravity,
safe, comfortable travel is assured on all roads and at
all speeds.
The Essex Six is built by Hudson under Hudson
patents. Thus it is the product of the famous
6-cylinder experience of the sixth largest builder o
motor cars in the world. It alone shares the advan-
tages of design and construction for which the Hud-
son Super-Six is celebrated.
Its economy in fuel and oil is one of the notable
achievements of motor engineering combining ex-
cellent performance capacity with exceptional gasoline
mileage. Easy accessibility and low prices on all
replacement parts make the Essex Six remarkably
economical in maintenance. Either the open touring
model or the closed car comforts of the Coach glve
value, we believe, not approached m this held.
The COACH
Closed Car Comforts
at little more
than Open Car Cost
The Coach is a Hudson-Essex invention.
No other type and no other car gives
“Closed Car Comforts at Open Car Cost”.
Everyone knows it represents the highest
closed car value. That is why it is the
largest selling 6-cylinder closed car in the
world.

The Seaside
and your Skin
Does salt water and sunshine spoil
the full enjoyment of your holi-
days by spoiling your complexion?
You can bathe all day and lie bask-
ing in the sun if you use a little
pure Mercolized Wax each night.
Mercolized Wax, gently massaged
at night before retiring, keeps the
skin of face and neck and arms so
clear and healthy that it positively
prevents the ravages of sunburn
and sea water.
The secret lies in the fact that
Mercolized Wax helps Nature to
renew the complexion every day
by imperceptibly dissolving away
the particles of the old, dried,
worn-out skin that otherwise
would choke the new perfect skin
underneath.
Get a package of Mercolized Wax at any
chemist and enjoy your holiday to the full.

Phone Central 1032, 1633.
Toorak and lesser suburbia are flocking
to the King’s for “The Truth About Blayds.”
The vice-regal Forsters and the Jellicoes set
the fashion —they were there the first
night; Lady Forster, in her favorite blue,
smiled out from the O.P. pen over red pre-
sentation roses, while a windowful of rosy
blossoms gladdened the ledge of the opposite
pen, which sheltered the ex-Maoriland Vice-
roy, his wife (a moonlight effect in blue and
silver, smiling amiable appreciation through-
out) and daughter Lucy (a ripe currant in
all red). A callous playwright has plunged
the three ladies of the cast into mourning
in the last act, and there is little chance
elsewhere for frocky effects. Irene Van-
brugh, however, knows the value of stage
purple and fine linen, and does her best. As
the lonely spinster she starts out in a flow-
ered ninon subdued with not too dowdy
black, and ends up as a prospective wife in
a wonderful ebony lace and ninon frock,
shawled at the back with georgette. Mrs.
Brough, as her chuckle-headed married sister,
dressed the first act with lilac and silver,
which became the part better than herself,
but she looked her nicest later on in a smart
turnout of black cr&pe, with fringe hemming
the apron panel and back cape. Janet Eccles
contributed nothing to the gaiety of nations
with her first frock of blue silk, hideously
undersleeved and vested with red velvet; but
her second effort of ecru lace, girdled with
gold, was pleasing, and her final frock, ot
black, snowily collared and cuffed with ninon,
was charming.
Melbourne kiddies have got a real panto-
mime at last; Hugh Ward has given it to
them at the Princess’s. The story of cver-
popular Cinderella is dressed according to
the old French crinoline period; and she
drives to her ball in a real glass coach drawn
by two black ponies with the necessary
equipment of powdered footmen. 1 urtlier-
more she wears real glass slippers with her
hooped skirts of old rose brocade, and her
wedding gown is a silver glitter under the
folds of a lace bridal veil. Kitty Iteidy,
an ideal Prince Charming, airs a whole
v/ardrobe. She dresses the ballroom act in
back chiffon velvet, buckled with diamonds,
and the wedding scene in white satin with a
three-cornered hat on her powdered wig.
The palpitating turn of the show is the magic
pool, with a drake and his harem of three
skimming over the surface as placidly as if
they were on their home waters. A quar-
tette of nymphs dive under the waves to
retrieve the lost glass slipper, and after a
long immersion one reappears with the shoe
glittering in her fingers.
On the opening night the vice-regal Strad-
brokes were in a box with daughter Helena
and a trio of sons. The Countess looks tired
with her long vigil by little Christopher’s
bedside. The house was overflowing with a
best-dressed audience, mostly of grown-ups
—censors, no doubt, come to see if the show
would do for the children. John Fuller had
to force his way through a thick hedge of
flowery vegetation to thank the public and
those behind scenes for helping to launch
the show so brilliantly.
His Majesty’s without pantomime at this
season is like Christmas dinner without plum-
pudding; but “Good Morning, Dearie,” helps
to fill the hiatus. The gallery girls saw to it
that little Josie Melville did not get away
without a speech; even if it was only to
climb over the hedge of flowers and parcels
and murmur shyly, “Glad to be back —aren’t
we all?” and then flee to cool her pretty
blushes on Minnie Everett’s protecting
shoulder. Swaying like a sapling in the
breeze, George Highland, in an exhausted
voice, thanked all concerned. The footlights
were the equator to two hemispheres of mil-
linery. Josie uses a whole series of smart
stage frockings, the most becoming a froth
of white georgette with a diamente glitter;
Thelma Burgess takes the stage in the last
act, looking like a snow queen in white satin;
the Sunshine Girls and all the other girls
introduce some ravishing creations; and
those in front of the house, even to the god-
desses in the gallery above, had dressed
themselves for the occasion.
The Royal rocked on its foundations on
Saturday under the weight of the plaudits
handed Moscovitch for his presentation of
“The Outsider.” The audience liked the
play and revelled in the gibes levelled at the
modern medicine man. There were dozens
of medicoes in the crowded house, and doubt-
less they chuckled too. Individually even
doctors can think, but collectively they must
follow the bell-wether. Jean Robertson, as
the interesting cripple heroine, wears a suc-
cession of fetching frocks. Her first was .
dove-like thing of accordeon pleatings, with a
wing-like cape tied with cherry ribbons and
caught at the wrists with lace cuffs: the
second was palest mauve georgette and silk
lace, anchored at the hip with blue caboclion ,
the third was a silken bed-jacket, topping
a crepe nightie. She makes her last bow
in a neglige yellow marocain of exquisite
manufacture. The captivating scenery of a
Harley-street drawing-room, furnished b rtnch
style in old-gold brocades and rose-silk hang-
ings, did not recall any doctor s waiting-room
that this critic has sat in.
The social giddy-go-round ceased whirling
to make way for the plum-pudding. Mel-
bourne has never seen such a frantic orgy
of buying: what the shops lost on the wet
Cup Week they have made up in Yuletide
shopping. Sweet lavender was so rushed
that the lavender-farms were shorn long be-
fore their due time, and most people took
home a sprig of red-berried holly, imported
from the cool heights of Macedon, to dress
the pudHing-tops. But Father Christmas no
longer fires the youngsters imagination as
a beneficent red-robed male fairy who does
nothing but steal down the chimney on
Christmas Eve to fill their stockings. Santa
Clauses who spring up in all the toy-selling
departments have more the appearance of a
gang of commercially-minded old gents, whose
Christmas carol sounds like c.o.d.
The exquisite little Athenaeum Theatre
could have been filled thrice over on Boxing
Night for the first showing of the Hawaiian
Entertainers. The hula-hula dancers, in
grass skirts with silver tissue veiling their
dusky bosoms, and underpants long enough to
make an Australian ballet-girl self-conscious,
illustrated the saying that what is perfectly
decorous in Clapham may be shockingly im-
proper in Martaban. The interval was un-
expectedly filled in with a tenor warble of
arresting sweetness and a pleasing fiddle
solo. The audience expressed loud admira-
tion for the rose-colored silk-brocaded cur-
tain ; all the furnishings are of rose color
melting to a tender mauve.
Father Christmas unloaded a large con-
signment of toys for the little sufferers in
the children’s ward of the Alfred Hospital.
The ward, which is panelled with nursery
rhymes, had been wreathed with flowers for
the coming of the white-bearded angel, who
had obligingly brought in extra playthings
for the ejiildren asked in to see the fun, and
presents for all the other patients and the
staff as well. Jack Barry Thompson, who
usually contributes to the gaiety of these
gatherings, had sent a coo-ee from Italy to
the small patients, and a huge Christmas
stocking for each child, with a book for all
the boys over 12. After the excitement
Matron Mann dispensed tea and cake to the
visitors in her parlor. Those responsible
included Mrs. Barry Thompson, Mrs. Russell
Gabb and two flapper daughters, Mrs. James
Angus, May Rimmington, Mrs. 11. J. Robert-
son, Mrs. Teddy Dyson and Doris Moffatt.
Here is our old friend Olive Wilton, who
side-tracked her stage career a few years
back to plant the Repertory movement in
Hobart. Judging by the rush on the booking-
office for all
her recent pro-
ductions, she
has rooted Re-
pertory pretty
firmly in Tas-
manian soil.
Between shows
the lady but-
ters her crust
by teaching
the islanders
elocution and
dramatic art.
The former
J.C.W. and .7.
and N. Tait
star has all
the necessary
e n t e r prise.
Failing to
tempt an an-
sw e r from
Barrie to nu-
merous written
requests for permission to produce his
plays, she asked the Tas. Agent-General
to use his diplomacy. This drew a cheerful
assent from the playwright, whose only con-
dition, besides a very modest fee, was that
Miss Wilton should always let him know
when she was using the plays. Gregan Mc-
Mahon, by the way, had much the same ex-
perience with Barrie, and at last put one
of his plays on without permission, forward-
ing the author a cheque afterwards. It
drew a good-tempered reply from Barrie, who
is really one of the most engaging of men,
but not half as methodical as the average
Scotsman.
The Town Hall was crowded on Saturday
night for the grand-opera artists’ farewell
sing-song, but many of the musical head-
lights were away holiday-making. Canon
and Mrs. Hughes filled two front-line seats,
alongside the Steward dame and her clerical
bridegroom and a whole panel of other clerical
collars. Ooncato, who dimpled in a green
silk hooped skirt flounced with gold, sang
sweetly in the middle register. Piccaluga
and Granforte, who sang “Figaro” and
Tosti’s “Ideale” as never before, wore tight
trousers, cravats and tailcoats of the
Georgian era. Phyllis Archibald was less
fanciful in azalea-colored brocade with
ostrich plumage weighting the side panel and
a silk-embroidered shawl for her “Carmen”
number.
Broothorn introduces you here to Mrs.
Fritz Hart, wife of the Melba Conserva-
torium director. The well-liked matron
shines by her own light as well as in her hus-
band’s. Start-
ing as a stu-
dent of the
Royal Aca-
demy of Music,
London, she
wa s making
for grand
opera, but a
breakdown in
health affected
her voice, and
finally Frit/
Hart tempted
her from a
stage career
into matri-
m o n y. Sho
now finds that
two yea r s’
operatic ex-
perience very
useful to her
husband, for
she not only
designs the whole of the costumes for his
students, but makes nearly all of them
herself. Mrs. Hart is famous in another
direction —as a breeder of terriers. She is
taking an English trip early in 1925 with
son Basil, and hopes to bring back a couple
of English black and tans with her and to
introduce a couple of the all-white variety
to Victoria.
Maoriland’s ex-Vicoroy has a Jellicoe cousin
living in this State. When the hero of Jut-
land was in Melbourne his lady, with a
couple of daughters, motored up to Marys-
ville to spend a day or two with the Aussie
kinsman and his wife, who run Wychcroif, a
mountain guest-house. That bright little
musical girl Eileen Cowper, who looked after
Hutchinson’s Library until the place closed
down, helped to show the distinguished visi-
tors round. She is now assisting to look
after the entertainment of Wyclicroff’s pay-
ing guests, and further acts as sec. to other
Marysville activities.
The Women Automobilists’ and Austral
Salon members wound up the year with rival
Christmas parties, staged on different days,
but in the same parlors. The Automobilists
livened a musical programme, provided by
Mrs. H. J. Robertson, with a guessing compe-
tition, and ending up with tea and cake. The
Salon sliivoo was preluded a night or two
earlier by a musical evening hostessed by
singer Millie Tree Chapman (in private life
Mrs. Lionel Wilson), who did it in gold drap-
eries overset with rich embroiderings. The
star performer was the little Reginald Franklin
widow, whose dramatic soprano would have
provided a rival for Gladys Moncrieff’s if it
had been taken over the footlights. She
was a Lismore (N.S.W.) girl, Wyn Verin-
der. Next year the Salon moves back to
Hardware Chambers, where its new rooms
have arisen glorified on the ashes of the old.
The Midnight Frolics, now at the Palace,
charm the eye first in Early Victorian hooped
skirts and poke bonnets. They next appear in
Russian peasant outfits, and finish up effec-
tively in modern trappings. Phyllis Amery
provides a nice setting for soap bubbles
blown from a clay pipe: she wears for
this act a brown dress petalled like a
rose, concluding in black tulle. Neil Flem-
ming’s star frock is of silver tissue, with
floral embellishments of coral and crystal;
and Dorothy White’s glittering outfit of sil-
ver and diamente makes many an admirer
pop-eyed.
“Baby Pat.” the Empire Baby who. on the
strength of her win, became a movie star
for a period, has reached the final distinction
of being featured in a court case, which comes
to all movie stars. The argument was over
the youngster’s photograph; the photo-
grapher who took it aimed to use it upon a
Christmas calendar he intended sending to
his customers. Pat’s parents asked that he
should be restrained, claiming that the taking
of the photograph for a definite object gave
him no copyright; and restrained he duly
was. But, as some calendars with Baby
Pat’s face smiling from them have been
sighted, it seems that the difficulty has
been overcome. Evidently a prize baby is
an asset.
The Blind Institute inmates got a Christ-
mas sing-song of the first musical water. Vio-
linist Gertrude Alger, Dr. Bartolini, Neville
Towne, Victor Baxter and other professionals
assisted, and Mrs. George Haines drew a
lighter note and sang a simpler tune at the
piano. After the last encore the James
Angus pair entertained the helpers at a
Christmas supper in one room, while they
spread a replica of the feed in the big Insti-
tute dining-room for the residential guests.
The voice of the minister was the only one
heard at a wedding in Jolimont just before
Christmas. The rest of the speaking re-
quired was done on the fingers, both bride,
Gwen Ashby, and the ’groom, William Elwin,
being deaf and dumb. The principal of the
Adult Deaf and Dumb Institution telegraphed
the orthodox questions to the pair, who
flashed back their equally orthodox replies
with their fingers.
A casual dropper-in at the Repertory
Society’s opening of the Athenaeum was
Judge Beeby, of N. S. Wales, who, his
way to spend a month’s holiday in the West,
broke his journey on purpose to have a
look at the Melbourne effort. Writer
of short stories (one of them was in last
week’s Bulletin) and of plays (one of them
was produced in Sydney a few months ago),
the Judge is naturally interested in Reper-
tory work; but he is so unassuming that
it was only by an accident that he was dis-
covered, dragged out of the obscurity in
which he had disposed himself and introduced
to the leaders of the Melbourne movement.
One of Albury's prettiest girls, Dorothy
Moore, is now flashing a diamond ring,
slipped on the usual finger by a popular
Albury bachelor, Les Colquhoun. When the
young man shed his Anzac captain’s trap-
pings for civvies, Dorothy, who is the daugh-
ter of the William Moores, had gold-brown
curls a-hanging down her back. Nowadays
she has none to hang, the curls having fallen
to the grim shingler.
Chief Justice Irvine has obtained _ a new
lease of life by his holiday triphe is look-
ing 10 years younger. The cordial welcome-
home he received made him thaw as he rarely
does. He was plainly touched by the fact that
Jones, Labor leader in the Upper House,
was at the feast, and joined in doing him
honor. Big John McWliae, ex-Agent-
Gcneral, was also a guest.
Adelaide’s Yuletide: —
Christmas parties have filled the social bill. There
was one at the Leavitt Ilall for the wives and
children of old South African soldiers, and another
and larger affair at the botanic Park on the same
afternoon. Hostesses at the latter were Janet
Gardner and Jean Gordon, and the 300 small guests
were gathered from the poorest parts of the City
by the Methodist and City Missions and packed
into special trams to take them to the park.
There was tea first, then Father Christmas and a
motorload of presents, and then another motor
loaded with ice-cream. The two hostesses were
responsible for the idea, but their friends rallied
round them with a will that made it possible for
the party to be on far bigger lines than originally
planned.
The S. Australian Grand Opera Co. and the
Repertory Theatre combined in a concert to add to
the Christmas Cheer Fund, with the Town Hall as
their setting and the Governor as one of the audience.
The Repertory’s offering was A. A. Milne’s “The
Great Broxopp,” excellently done by Catharine Neill,
Hinda Sando and lloyston Marcus. The Opera Co.,
duly dressed for the parts, gave numbers from
various operas, and further cash came in from sweets
anu flower sales under the wing of Mrs. Savory,
Mrs. A. M. Cudmore and Mrs. Harcus.
Mrs. Bickford’s estate lias been sworn at £157,000,
and a clause giving the trustees power to decide
just which charities are to benefit should any doubt
appear obviates the risk of controversies that arise
from loosely-worded wills.
The energy and optimism of some people! Picture,
in this climate, a flannel dance in mid-December.
A Heaven-sent cool evening made vigorous dancing
possible, and there were Chinese-lantern-hung grounds
for the less energetic to wander in. It was given
at Ingomar, Upper Kensington, to mark the coming
of age of John Ingleby.
The Art Gallery and Public Library have more
items to add to their inventories. William Sowden
is bringing back from England for the Gallery a
collection of pictures and china and engravings
from Mrs. Courts Michie (better known on this side
as Mrs. George McCulloch), and Langdon Bonython
and Dr. Angas Johnson have secured some more
early records for the Library. Langdon Bonython's
contribution includes a diary kept by the James
Henderson who was associated with Light in his
exploration of ’43, and is the gift of Major J. S.
Henderson, of Cornwall.
The week has seen the packing of trunks for the
usual exodus to hills or sea. Victor Harbor, once
a seaside village of the old-clothes-and-simple-life
variety, is rapidly attaining the dubious charms of
a fashionable watering-place, and Glcnelg has fo
grown that .it runs its own Palais de Dance. At
the official opening, Mayor Tassie- and Attorney-
General Denny made the inevitable speeches, and all
the seaside suburb’s best and brightest footed it on
the well-polished floor.
The J. H. Symons bade local members of the
Royal Colonial Institute to tea at Manoah, their
home at Upper Sturt, and as the garden is one of
the show places ot the hills, the Symon library
one to envy, and the. Symons themselves super-
hosts, the fixture was a.clleery one.
’Varsity students took the Prince of Wales Theatre
for their annual frivol, got excellent booking, and
staged a show no less excellent. The star item
of the programme was “Ain’t Love Grand,” a
musical comedy the libretto for which was written
by Hope Crampton, and very good it was. Verna
Hackett, Asthore Symons, George Letcher and Jack
Glover scored the biggest hits ; and as Amelia Osborne
in an adapted version of the Waterloo scene of
“Vanity Fair” Hope Crampton proved herself to
possess as neat a gift for speaking as for writing.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
SAY
Kayser
GLOVES
If you weren’t out of town over the holi-
days you were, of course, at Randwick on
Boxing Day. Certainly a few thousands
were at the cricket; but the result of the
Test was such a foregone conclusion that
only expert interest remained glued to it. So
Randwick tossed her head, sure of her
admirers, no matter what overseas vamps
might try to lure her “steadies” from her.
The dressing was the usual holiday hotch-
potch, strongly flavored with macintoshes
and umbrellas. The greyness of the day
brought out fur wraps, and black was every-
where. Mrs. Hector Clayton’s slimness was
defined by a limpet-like black coat embossed
in Chinese, and topped by a feathery small
hat. White georgette and black satin en-
folded Mrs. Malcolm Mackellar. Just-back-
from-Europe Mary Regan finished off sum-
mery georgettes with a wide fan hat. Janet
Knox and Mrs. A. E. Hughes were devotees
of cinnamon browns, and Mrs. Dundas Allen
was another in the same shade. Short skirts
and bare legs gave the onlooker a shock till
the limbs turned out to be not bare but only
nude, which is the latest (or thereabouts)
in stockings.
The Sydney girl doesn’t agree with Mr.
Kipling that the cricketers are “flannelled
cafs.” Her allegiance during the Test match
filled the stands; whole rows of tightly-
jammed womanhood showed not one mere
male in their midst or at their ends. The
Hill had its uncoated thousands, and the
stand near the pavilion hung out the “Men
only” sign, otherwise the sewing sex occu-
pied the bench. Sutcliffe’s looks, Gilligan’s
Valentino smile and the size of Tate’s feet and
his cavalier disposition were as keen sub-
jects for discussion as Richardson’s batting
or the bowling of Gregory or Mailey. Small
school girls kept stern records in notebooks
against the after-lunch arrival of big
brothers. Everybody lunched on the stands,
ice-cream boys did a roaring trade, and here
and there fingers feverishly knitted or
crocheted that last-minute Christmas gift.
Sydney’s new Labor Mayor, P. V. Stokes,
being a bachelor, his cousin, Cecilia Walsh,
will act as hostess for him. Australia is go-
ing to have plenty of chances of judging how
the young unmarried woman shapes as enter-
tainer. Tasmania will be vice-reined by Mar-
garet, daughter of its Governor, the Socialist
knight James O’Grady; and Jean Wardle
will be rather in the limelight when her Com-
modore father entertains the American
Fleet. England, incidentally, breaks the
world’s record with youthful mayoresses,
Richmond and Kingston both having school-
girls to 'do their hostessing. However, enter-
taining is not the job it used to be in tin-
days when Lady Mary Wortley Montague
hostessed for her father. She carved for the
immense house-parties her father gathered
around him, being forced to have her own
meals an hour before he and his guests came
to table.
Sibyl Morrison made history when a few
days ago she held her first brief before Justice
Mauglian in the Supreme Court, being the
first woman in N. S. Wales to make such an
appearance. The brief was given her by
I). R. Hall, who was Attorney-General at
the time the bill was passed enabling women
to practise. The case had to do with the
Testators’ Family Maintenance Act, which
Mr. Hall also helped to pass, though it was
Arthur Griffith who talked it into popu-
larity.
Among the first entries for the Christmas-
week Marriage Handicap were fluffy-haired
ReTyl Alexander, of Woollahra, and Mischa
Dobrinski, the Russian violinist who 18
mouths ago dropped into Sydney from the
Land of Revolution via the East of Asia.
Beryl, who is a clever pianist, took the oath
in front of Rabbi Cohen, drawing all her
courage from impeccable bridal attire of ivory
georgettes and Honiton lace, for ’maids she
had none. Bride’s father and mother staged
a reception strictly of the blood-tie order at
the Carlton.
Zillah Thomas, whose father deals in law
in Goulburo, but who has of late resided
within the cosmopolitan circuit of Darling-
hurst, duly married Alec Barnard at St.
James’s, in the presence of her parents and a
few pewsful of friends and relations. Alice
Furner, of Goulburn, ’maided, and Robin
Chalmers best-manned. The libations were
poured at the Australia.
Wedding parties are wearing away the
stone steps of St. Stephen’s. The other
night singing-girl Dorothy Mould added the
print of her satin-shod feet to the myriads
that have gone before. Once across the
threshold Douglas Nettlefold, of Hobart,
claimed her as his, and Steele Craik, of
Mosman, riveted the gyves in a painless and
ellicient manner. Dorothy, who is a slim,
dark creature, wore soft, rich ivory chiffon
velvet coruscating with diamente, silver and
crystal tassels and a gorgeous expanse of
silver train —like the path of the moon across
the waters seen from Bradley’s Head. Wyn
Tnrton and Mercia Garrard ’maided her in
frocking that was a gavotte in lilac and rose.
Scott Nettlefold best-manned and Leonard
Nettlefold was second male support.
Margaret, the only daughter of the Ewan
Fraser couple, former Sydneysiders who
now' make their headquarters at Frampost,
in Sussex, has become engaged to a son of
Sir Abe Bailey. The Baileys are neighbors,
and Margaret and her young man have been
pals since childhood. Sir Abe is one of the
principal Transvaal mineowners, and is the
first baronet of the line.
Doris Paton, of Randwick (her father was
the noted horse-trainer), has given up the
idea of being a second Melba to become en-
gaged to “Evie” Cox, of Yarrandale, West
Wyalong.
Cupid casualties on a recent voyage from
England were Beatrice Ross Nott, of Point
Piper (her mother is Edward Lloyd Jones’s
only sister), and Captain Chirnside, son of
Percy Chirnside, of Melbourne. The young
man, who is captain in the 11th Hussars, is
stationed at York; and for three years (the
wedding will take place almost immediately)
the pair will make the garrison town their
headquarters, before returning to Australia to
settle on the station in the Western District
that father has recently given his son.
Fair-haired Marjorie Milson, a bud from
Kirribilli’s oldest family-tree (her father is
Arthur Milson), has just uttered the word
that gives Dr. F. C. Thompson, of Neutral
Bay, the right to think that Dante, after all,
must have been but a poor fish at wooing.
In plain English, the two are engaged.
May Mitchell made her first public bow as
secretary of the Crown-street Women’s Hos-
pital at Mona Daley’s instigation. Mona,
who has resigned to get married, cast a wide
net and gathered in a shoal of newspaper
women to the Wentworth, and here at a
business man’s lunch presented her sucessor.
May is quite young, with a resolute chin and
a pair of cool grey eyes that cinnamon
georgette frocking and a droopy liat enhanced,
but could not make frivolous looking. Mona
herself turned on Paris frocking of grey and
cherry georgette, served with a picture hat,
and some ripping emeralds, the gift of the
betrothed, A. C. Godhard. Her mother, Mrs.
H. S. Bulloch, gave a cheery push-off to the
junketing.
May Moore presents Ina Bosworth, whose
brilliant fiddling over the ether w r aves of
Farmer’s
b r o a dcasting
has been caus-
ing comment
throughout her
native land.
For Ina is Aus-
tralian Mel-
bourne - born
—though her
j o u ru eyings
and studies
have turned
her into a citi-
zen of the
world. Maori-
bmd and its
w in dblown
streets made
lor schoolgirl
world; ten
years’ hard
st udy in Lon-
don with the
late John
Saunders, of the Guildhall School, and Dr.
Van Loen, of Leipsic, gave her a European
culture; and tours in South Africa and Asia
put a glittering thread in the multi-colored
coat of her nationality. But perhaps her
best work was done as a member of the
Feminine Quartette during the war: for five
years she helped troops in France to forget
the horrors of mud and blood.
The rime of frost and the red of holly*
berries that ushered in Christmas at the
Wentworth were not out of keeping with a
N. S. Wales December made up of icy winds
and drenching rains. Tables bloomed into
centrepieces of snow-laden fir-trees hung
about with glittersome balls; and on most
of them gaily-colored turkeys shivered sym-
pathetically when platters of real brother
were sacrificed to the festive season. The
ballroom and the palm courts were filled
with jazzers, but, like Cinderella, they had
to fade away on the stroke of 12, because
the Wentworth is surrounded by churches —
nearly every denomination has picked Church
Hill as a beacon for its followers; and, of
course, midnight service on Christmas Eve
was an institution before the saxophone had
wailed its first infantile note.
Skalski, whom Sydney looked upon with
a cold eye, has met with better luck in Lon-
don, where he has been appointed artistic
director of the Carl Rosa Opera Company.
At Dublin, leading these forces, his conduct-
ing of “Butterfly” received a wild ovation.
Rather more than 22 years ago a few
women had a chat in Miss Rose Scott’s draw-
ing-room. Dr. Mary Booth, then recently
back from the Cold Land, boldly suggested
that the time had come to form a Women’s
Club in Sydney. The ayes had it. On the
first committee was Mary herself, Rose Scott,
Miss Sutherland, Miss Isabel Dickson (the
great chum of Louisa Macdonald, the
Women’s College chieftainess) and Miss Fry.
The impressive but somewhat cheerless build-
ing in Elizabeth-street, which recently had
its last smack of paint, is the most recent
fruit of that meeting.
Here’s a young man whose head in profile
resembles those on old Roman coins. He is
Vivian Crock-
ett, the Sydney
author of
“M e s salina,”
the novel that
ha s had a
sheaf of excel-
lent reviews,
and, what is
more wonder-
ful, a double
p u blication —
in London by
Jonathan
Cape, and in
New York by
Boni and Live-
right—an illus-
trated edition
this. T h e
author started
out as a medi-
cal student (no

Sydney singing-girl Margaret Bruce, who
spent a holiday in her own country last
year, has met with still further success since
her return to Europe. Dinli Gilly has made
the Australian his partner, and her head-
quarters are now in Cavendish-square. Mar-
garet and Dorothy Helmrich (she’s another
who has made a steady success in London)
are chums, and when in Sydney studied with
Mr. Mavrogordato, who was at the Con.
S. A. Parker, in .George-street, is showing
an early Streeton with a history. As far
hack as 1900 the Titheradge family were
living in an old Georgian house in St. John’s
Wood, London, and one of their frequent
visitors was young Arthur Streeton. Tither-
adge commissioned the Australian to do
some pastels for the drawing-room. He did
a series of them, all decorative and colorful.
One of them, “The Wave,” came into Mrs.
Herrick Knowles’s possession, and now she
is selling some of her art treasures, this
among them. “The Wave” represents a
big comber rushing through the Heads to
engulf the Manly boat —if it isn’t careful.
George Collingridge. artist, historian and
Esperantist, has produced another of his
interesting booklets. The simple title is “It,”
and “It” is principally a collection of wood-
cuts. The first of these is from an old Dutch
engraving, and depicts the rain-tree. This
ever-green wonder (of which there is a speci-
men in Brisbane) creates and condenses its
own clouds to such an extent that clear and
sparkling water flows from its leaves. One
of the most interesting woodcuts is taken
from a painting made by Mr. Collingridge at
Tliomery, on the banks of the Seine, while he
was a pupil of Corot’s. The book contains a
great fund of knowledge and amusing com-
ment from the 70 years’ store of a gentleman
of the old school.
Shan Bullock, whose “Loughsiders” gets
a good review on the Red Page this week, is
a good-looking North of Irelander who bas
an interest for Sydney because his equally-
attractive only sister, Mrs. Liddell, is not only a
well-known pen-woman, but a leader among
the National Councillors; and next year she
will succeed Miss Preston Stanley as high
priestess of the Women Masons.
Books to please the boy of from 14 to 20
are needed by the Bush Book Club. The
Victoria League lias whispered in the ear
of the 8.8. C. that literature—especially
travel and adventure stories —would gladden
the hearts of the Dreadnought boys who are
endeavoring to settle down to a new life in
the very often mighty lonely spaces. Con-
tributions will be thankfully received at 161
Castlereagli-street.
General Granville Ryric, who retired from
the R.A.A. in a fierce gale of after-war re-
trenchment, is peacefully following the family
traditions as a sheep-farmer in the heart
of Monaro. There was a gathering of the
clan this Christmas in the former gunner’s
new homestead: his lady is just home from
a trip to Wembley. The Ryrie twins, a pair
of attractive Cornstalk maids, are still in
London.
St. Petersburg is not the only European
capital to reckon a new name a fair thing.
This Letter is implored by the Consul for
Norway to mention that Christiania will
become Oslo with the arrival of 1925. M hat
were the reasons for the change, or what
the associations conveyed by the new name,
is something we can only dream about; but,
anyway, Oslo is easier to spell.
There’s still another solution of the pro-
blem of what to do with our girls. There’s
nothing wrong with the- circus business as a
profession, judging by its results in dia-
monds. One lady-proprietor of shies and
merry-go-rounds, of fat ladies and skeleton
men, claims to have £lOOO sunk in the spark-
lers. At any rate, that’s the amount she
demanded before Acting-Chief Justice Street
the other day in place of the gems which
she had given a man to hold and which he
mislaid. There are highbrows who can prove
that the merry-go-round is the sole surviving
symbol of the tourney, and that by having a
fly on the gees you are really keeping alive
a tradition of the jousts of chivalry. We
can’t verify that, but the quarts of diamonds
speak for themselves.
The voyage was being plunged into deeper
depths of monotonous gloom by one of those
old-time book teas. You know the sort —
where you cavort about with a symbolic de-
sign pinned to your chest: something like
the birth notices in the Herald to signify
“The Neweomes” and so on. Everybody had
turned up wearing something more or less
apt, when the thrill of the ship breezed into
the saloon in gorgeous raiment but with no
placard. “Aren’t you in character?” every-
body asked in turn. “Oh, yes,” she cooed
in reply—“surely you can guess what I re-
present.” From group to group she flut-
tered, but nobody got within hail. At
length the determincd-to-win-the-competition
person swoopiVl down on the lass with a
“Well, I’ve guessed everybody else. Now I’m
going to place you.” By this time the un-
divided attention of the room was on them.
“I’m by Arnold Bennett.” prompted the girl.
Still nobody guessed, and in the end she com-
placently divulged the secret. She was “The
Pretty Lady.”
One would hardly think that the woman
who spends a lifetime patching father’s
trousers and darning sockfc could be suspected
of it, yet Dulcie Deamer asks in all serious-
ness in next week’s Woman’s Mirror “Are
Women Savages?” There are several vivid
short stories; the maiden who is due to bo
led to the altar will learn a lot from the
letters of a man of a past generation;
there is the usual collection of articles about
the home, the kitchen, fashions, the nursery
and fancy-work; also the chance of collecting
a cheque in the £6O prize competition. And
all the time the wonder grows how the 64
pages can be produced for threepence.
leather Christmas comes to Brisbane:—
Sir Matthew went to Rosemount to hand Christmas
gifts to the sick Diggers amid a floral setting. Dr.
Melville, Matron Langford, W. T. Robertson and
some of the committee received the Vice-Regals, and
Ted England, Ruth Portraite, and Jean MacTaggart
added a musical accompaniment.
Lennon’s was all dressed up for a Christmas
dinner dance, roses, bon-bons and quaint masks
making carnival of the ballroom. Bells and baskets
of flowers adorned the NVhittinghams’ table, to which
the Jardine Grahams, Glyn Connollys, Mrs. Harry
Mills, Mollie Brenan, Irma Dearden, Daphne Gauk-
rodger, Leo Morgan, Dr. Lockhart Spence and H.
Cadell Garrick had been beckoned.
William Heughan had to show his bonny knees
a score of times at his final concert before the
audience would let the braw Scot go. Lenzer also
got big claps for his violin solos, and pianist
Sayer for the accompaniments. Mrs. Cain was there
with a party, the E. S. Jacksons, the George Hender-
sons, Forrests, Merna Gillies, Bodkins, the Allans,
Tessa Reading and Taylor. •
Rhinda Robbins, in cream with Chinese ’broideries,
gave a party at Lennon’s amid a setting of water-
lilies and mauve asters. Every guest carried away an
aster freighted with farewell thoughts from their
hosts, who are off on a prolonged trip to the Cold
Country. A suede travelling cushion was presented
to Mrs. Robbins at her Auchenflower home by friends
in the district.
Hundreds of soldiers’ kiddies were at the Exhi-
bition for the gift-day to relatives of those fallen
in the war. Sir Matthew turned up and spoke at
the luncheon. Some £5OO was spent on the presents.
The usual round of parties has helped Beryl
Wonderley, of Toowoomba, to pass the time cill
the end of the month, when she marries. Mrs.
Stark and Luc}' Robinson were responsible for a
tea, and several matrons arranged a luncheon at the
Club Hotel, Jessie Robertson a bridge evening, and
Mrs. Cooke a kitchen tea.
Winton saw the tying of the knot betwixt Teresa
Pyne, of the Grove, and Dick French, of Longreaeh,
by Father Carry. The bride wore ivory crepe ae
Chine and carried an ivory and gold prayer-book
given by the Presentation Sisters, Longreaeh. The
cry “Bush fire!’’ interrupted the wedding breakfast,
and the men guests dashed out to save what they could
of a neighbor’s selection, which was ablaze over
a wide area. The situation met, the revels began
anew. Later the chief actors in the ceremony went
off to Buderim for the honeymoon. They will settle
in Charleville.
Five hundred thousand articles were posted at
the G.P.O. on a single day last week. So many
people left for Sydney and Melbourne by rail that
every archaic carriage the railways don’t boast of
had to be hauled out of its cobwebbed repose to
cope with the rush.

SURE CATCH TACKLE
After approximately 29 hours of actual
cricket: —cricket that was always keen but seldom
exciting—Australia won the first Test match at Sydney
by 193 runs, scoring 450 and 452 against 298 and
411. The“ second-wicket partnership of Collins
(114) and Ponsford (110) gave the side an advantage
which it never lost, although the Englishmen had
hopes at two or three stages of the game, notably
when Hobbs (115) and Sutcliffe (59) retired for
lunch on the second day with 151 on the board
and 10 wickets to fall. But Sutcliffe left at 157 —
he spooned one of Mailey’s to Vic Richardson at
silly point—and then, in dismal succession, Hearne
lifted a full toss straight to square leg; Woolley
blocked a fast one and stood in momentary medita-
tion while the ball rebounded from his right foot,
to the wicket; Hobbs edged a rising ball to third
slip ; Sandham, playing a second too late, was bowled
neck and crop, and Chapman ran himself out—6
for 254. Hendren (74 n. 0.) showed that the bowling
was nothing wonderful, but the aggressive little
Middlesex man, who hit Gregory for a magnificent
sixer, could find no one to stay with him. Again
the Englishmen looked to have a “possible” when
the in their 1 second essay, had lost
Bardsley (22), A. J, Richardson (98), Kellewiy
(23), Collins (60), Ponsford (27), V. Richardson
(18), Hendry (22) and Gregory for 281—433 on —
but Taylor (108) and Mailey (46 n. 0.) upset
their calculations by putting on 127 for the tenth
wicket. Taylor’s batting and that of Woolley (123)
in England’s second knock —little Freeman helped
the tall left-hander to add 128 for the ninth wicket
-—were the brightest exhibitions of the match, albeit
the centuries of Collins, Ponsford, Hobbs and Sut-
cliffe (115 in the second innnings), and A. J.
Richardson’s unlucky knock were full of merit.
The Australians’ victory is attributable to the
consistency of their batting. Whereas seven English-
men failed to reach double figures in the first innings
and six in the second, only Gregory (0 and 2) and
Hendry (3) shared the melancholy distinction with
them at the end of the match. Hearne and Sandham,
of whom so much had been expected, made 7 and 9
respectively; Tate’s aggregate was 7, Strudwjck’s 8
and Gilligan’s 1. In ground fielding, however, the
Englishmen were superior, and Tate’s bowling was
decidedly better than anything on the Australian
side. The Sussex man’s figures are remarkable: —
O. M. R. W.
55.1 11 130 6
33.7 8 98 5
After the man had bowled his 441st ball in the
first innings, many oldtimers shook their heads and
said “He won’t last long at that rate.” But the
object oi their sympathy is used to doing a. power
of work; in England last season he bowled 1469.5
six-ball overs (116 more than Parker, the next on
the list) and bagged 205 wickets, averaging 13.74.
For Australia, Hendry got 3 wickets for 41, Mailey
7 for 308, Gregory 7 for 226 and Ivelleway 2 for
104 ; but the quartette will need at least one rein-
forcement if Australia is to win the rubber. Ryder
should certainly go into the Melbourne team in
place of Vic Richardson, and if Bardsley fails in
the second match he will have to make way for
one of the younger men, preferably an all-rounder.
He has become painful to watch in the field.
The game established records for duration (it
extended into the seventh playing day), attendances
(47,000 on Dec. 20 and 164,000 altogether), and gate-
money ( £16,000) ; and Hobbs made cricket history
by contributing his seventh Test-match century and
going 66 runs better than McLaren’s aggregate of
1931, the highest previously reached by an English-
man. In the second match against the Afrikanders
in England last year the Surrey star and Sut-
cliffe hit up 268 for the first wicket. Their fine
displays on the Sydney Cricket Ground suggest
that, unless Australia strengthens the bowling depart-
ment, they are not unlikely to repeat the achieve-
ment at our expense.
“Machete”: Tate’s tally of 11 wickets for
228 has tended to eclipse the excellent showing of
the Kent slow bowler, Freeman. For a trundler
of his type, Freeman’s length all through his long
job of 86 overs, 15 of which were maidens, was
as admirable as his luck was vile, a notable in-
stance of this last being the missing of Collins
by Hendren —an easy chance it was, too —on the
opening day, when the Australian captain had just
reached the forties. The little chap’s average was
5 for 258, as against Mailey’s 7 for 308 —the latter
bowled 63 overs, only three of them maidens. Free-
man’s spirited batting in England’s second innings
helped to endorse Gilligan’s selection of him, a step
that was a good deal criticised.
“Hasen”: More interesting than much of the
cricket at the first Test, was the strife between the
lower ranks sitting on the slope in the “outer” and
the hardy spirits who dared, to stand in front of
them. Now and then masked batteries opened on
the enemy with a disconcerting salvo of banana-
and orange-skins and the like, but for the most
part wordy missiles sufficed. These ranged from
polite invitations to “Come and sit down, too,” all
the way to bludgeoning personalities. A quieter
voice that came in usually during a lull in the
heavier firing scored several hits, as in the case
of a Steele Rudd type who survived five minutes of
comments on “ziffs” and advice about barbers only
to succumb to the soft warning, “Time to get the
cows in, Dad!” But the most striking victory was
THESE BLESSED BINOCULARS!
“These are rotten glasses; I haven't spotted a winner with them
all day.”
gained over the owner of a fiery moustache, every
hair of which bristled with determination to stand
up for its rights. This one’s female companion
rather hampered the hill batteries, but they tried.
Countless invitations to sit down left him quite
unshaken until the same quiet voice asked very
plaintively and considerately, “Well, if you don’t
want to sit down, mister, d’you think your wife
might like to?”

James Cowan; “FY7,” in his remarks
about the M.C.Ck’s ruling as to changing the grip
from right, hand to left hand when batting (B.
11/12/’24), refers to me as “the late Jimmy Cowan.”
It is the first I have heard of it. Although I gave
up cricket some years ago, I am still at the Brisbane
Grammar School, and very much alive, and hope
to continue so for some years to come. For the
rest, I cannot understand why any human being
possessed of two arms and two legs should use one
in preference to the other.

“G. 0.8.” : The Victorian cricket selectors
included 18-year-old Keith Millar, of Hawthorn-E.
Melbourne, as twelfth man in the team that played
South Oss. Keith earned the place by consistency
with the bat and ball and a footballer’s usual bril-
liance in the field—he plays footer with Richmond.
All eyes were on hint in his next pennant match, for
it was felt that if he did anything out of the way
he would be promoted in the room of some old
stager like Park. And he did not disappoint his friends,
for on a perfect pitch he took 6 good North Melbourne
wickets for 19 runs, all clean bowled. The selectors
showed their appreciation of this performance by
omitting him from the side to meet N. S. Wales.
Even his old post of emergency was given to Rans-
ford, who is over 40 and has been in indifferent
form. But Ransford has been in the team for
years and years, and though it is hard to get into
the Victorian XI, it is much more difficult to get our.
The college match in Adelaide produced
some fine cricket, but chiefly on the batting side,
and that is not the talent S.A. is most in need of.
Moorhouse, for St. Peter’s, made 166, easily a
record for that school, though Clem Hill and
Dclling in their day; each topped the 300 for Prince
Alfred’s. Hone, for the other side, put up a record
for the match with a double century, 106 and 166.
It was a fitting ending to a long rivalry between
these two captains in various sports. S.P.S.C.
scored 370 and 296, but at the end of a week’s
play were badly beaten by P.A.C. totals of 375
and 536. Alexander, for the winners, had a fine
all-round performance; 99 and 55, also 4 wickets
for 66 and 7 for 83.

George Giffen, the old cricketer, was plain-
tiff in a recent case in an Adelaide court, claiming
from a fellow-official in the G.P.O. half of a £55
award for successful tipping in a sporting weekly.
Giffen’s claim was that he had handed over the
coupon as a favor, on condition of “sharing fifty-
fifty.” The defence was a simple denial of such an
arrangement! Verdict for the defendant.
* * * *
“Coot”: W. Sidehottom, of the Speck,
must surely be the oldest Australian cricketer. In
1862 he played for Tasmania against Stephenson’s
English team—he , is the sole survivor of the Speck’s
22 —and he represented the North against the South
of Tasmania on a number of occasions. Though
89, Sidebottom is still keenly interested in the game.

The A.J.C. December meeting lived up to
its reputation of being a brute of an affair for
backers. Randwiek watchers were confident that
L K. S. Mackinnon’s Balbus, trained by old Ike Foul-
sham, hadn’t done enough work for the Villiers
Stakes, so punters neglected the three-year-old son
of St. Alwyne—Celine in their haste to get on Love-
sign (4’s), All Home (6’s) and Parody (B’s),
Balbus being friendless, as far as the public was
concerned, at 26’s. The
event proved that - Ike
knew more than the
recorders of gallops,
for Balbus got there
by a head from Royal
Dighton (12’s) and
Cofcus (16’s). Perhaps
Royal Dighton Would
have reversed the posi-
tions with, a stronger
boy in the saddle, but
Balbus is no slouch.
He cost ‘1650 guineas
as a yearling, and; the
owner will get it back
with interest. Other
dolorous circumstances
fpr speculators were
the victories of Naro-
pus (20’s), Lovebox
(20’s), Confu s i o n
(14(g) and Nouveau
RicJje (12’s), nor did
Bairn (3;S) and Belle
(9 to 2) benefit them
much. Boaster (in the
same stable) was as
good a favorite as
Bairn, and Lanome was
at, -shorter odds than
Belle. And the second
day was almost as
disastrous as the first.
Certainly, s there was
good money for Love-
box (3’s) in , the
i )ri pmber ..Stakes,
people having been im-
pressed by the Redfern-
Honey Guide filly’s fine
showing when un-
fancied by the stabl.: ;
and many showed a
profit, on Kilwa ,(4’a)
in the Hurdle and on
one or other of the
dead-heaters—Dion, at
s’s, and Hemisphere,
at 7’s—in the Christ-
mas Handicap. But
Fair, Rosfileen’s success
(at 20’s) in the ,Flying
Handicap was an awful
facer, for the mare I had
never previously shown
a liking for six fur-
longs : arid there was
little lucre for Cliffdale
(1.25) in the A.J.C.
Handicap, less for
Orange Prince (14’s) in the Summer Nursery,
and only a few pounds here and there for Prince
Minimbah (20’s) in the Summer Cup, The Prince
showed good form as a two- and early three-year-old,
bqt ran very badly when backed in indifferent
company at Randwiek on Dec. 6. He probably owes
his triumph to Tooheyy who brought Inin up on the
rails just in time to dish the dead-heaters, unlucky
Irish Flower (B’s) and Confusion (s’s), which very
promising young horse was not so well served as
the winner in the matter of horsemanship. A natty
bay gelding by Prince Foote —Australian Flower,
Prince Minimbah is trained for John “Baron” by
the former crack jockey, Albert Wood. Ho ran
the 13 furlongs in 2min. 46|sec.
It rained most of the time on the opening day of
the Tattersall’s Club meeting, but followers of W.
Kelso’s stable didn’t mind. The Randwiek trainer,
who was due for a turn of luck, started four horses
and won with three —Boaster (6 to 4) in the Chelms-
ford Handicap, Coinage (7’s) in the Juvenile-Stakes
and Note (s’s) in the Denman Handicap, in which
many thought Mangostan had shaded the older mare.
The fourth nag. Bairn (6’s), gave the stable a good
run for its money in the Carrington Stakes, but
corrld not pace it at the: finish with Tressie (B’s),
and Coleus cut her out oi third money in the’,last
few strides. Tressie, who is by Tressady—Sibar, has
more than paid her way at Randwiek since she
arrived from the “ponies,” and such a fast finishing
bit of stuff should do well over the Doncaster
distance. The time— lmin. 15sec. —was by no means
bad considering the going. Valais Queen disappointed
the multitude who had taken 5 to 2 about her chance,
and ruined many Tattersall’s Cup doubles. If Con-
fusion has recovered from the effects of his severe
race on Boxing Day he will go hear winning Tatt’s
Cup with the minimum weight, and Prince Charles
(Bst. 61b.) may give some cheek.
A 15-to-l chance in Graball, with the
youthful Bastian aboard, stole the £l3OO Ilopetoun
Cup at Caulfield on Boxing' Day. The youngster
drove his 'mount to the front at the entrance to
the straight, and the outsider lasted long enough
to defeat Sailing Home (2’s) by inches. The English
stallion’s defeat added to the depression of a
crowd already dispirited by the weather, which was
abominable; and there were numerous mordant
comments on Dempsey’s riding. However, Dempsey
made amends by getting David Garrick home, at
4’s, in the next (and last) race; and at Moonee
Valley next day, it having fined up in the mean-
time, he covered himself with glory by riding three
winners in succession. One of the three was BufHine
(Cellini —Buffet), who took the Nonga Handicap rtn
ridiculously easy fashion, the ten furlongs being
left behind in 2min. 7lsec. This fellow may be
Sailing Home’s most dangerous opponent in the
Bagot Handicap on New Year’s Day.
* * * *
Huette (Night Hawk —Barmeny) duly
landed the W.A. Derby for Dr. Officer. Odds were
laid on the filly, who is reckoned to have a good
chance in the Perth Cup, and her six opponents
gave her no trouble, but the time (2min. 40}sec.)
was poor. Another hot favorite to do the trick on
the opening day of the W.A.T.C. meeting was
Easingwold in the w.f.a. Perth Stakes; The big
chestnut galloped home at; his leisure, at 2min.
7 2-ssec. for the 10 furlongs, and demonstrated that
horses like Bronzine, Eracre and Tranquil, who
used ‘to race about Sydney, are not in his class.
* * * *
The Tasmanian Derby was also won by a
filly who was favorite in the betting: Head Girl,
by Spearhead—Tonga Girl. She carried 21b. more
than the Bst. which is Derby weight in the Speck,
and ran the 12 furlongs in 2min. 37 3-ssec, There
is good staying blood in Head Girl, and she may
be destined for more important things than a
£3OO “classic.”

“8.5. A.”: It was at the Victoria Park
racecourse (S.A.), where Tommies have to bet “under
the lap,” and a dispute over a wager had finished
by the bookie flatly refusing to part up. The
punter called McShortodds every unkind natpe he
could think of; his flow of invidious nouns and
participles that cracked like bursting shells was a
revelation in the resources of our language. 1
thought he had exhausted himself when he got to
“you , etc.,” but his peroration was
perhaps more effective than all that had gone
before. “An’ that’s praisin’ y’up,” he concluded
emphatically.

The Victorian Treasury will lose £76,000
a year now that the sffper-tax on betting tickets has
been allowed to lapse. Peacock sought to introduce a
substitute, tax of 1 per cent on the registered book-
makers’ turnover, just as the end of the session
was within- coo.-ee, but the preliminary resolution
was rejected on the voices, so Labor got its way.
The promise, express or implied, given by that
party at election-time to certain of its friends was
fulfilled in its Budget, and then it so engineered
business in the House that there was no time for
a fight. From Jan. 1, .instead of stamp duties of
6d., 2d., and Id. on betting tickets, only the 3d. and
Id. rates enacted in 1916 will be operative. But
the tote (minus the odds-yeller) has been brought
nearer, and the bill won’t be sponsored by a private
member, as has always happened hitherto, When it
makes its appearance again.

“Edmßc”: Early Kalgoorlie racing evi-
denced the folly of importing what can be locally
produced. During the good years of the fields, the
ICalgoorlie and Boulder clubs went in for big Autumn
and Spring meetings, at which horses, trainers,
jockeys, stable-muckers, bookmakers and so forth were
all imported, from Perth. After one of these “carnivals”
the tradespeople used to ' complain that money was
scarce, and very hard to get in, and they thought
it would be scarcer still if meetings were held
more frequently, as was periodically suggested. They
overlooked the real cause of their troubles, -which
was that, under the importing system, the money
was all going out of the district —even the cost »»t
teting the animals from Perth was paid by the
clubs. Also the “jokes” that evil-minded people
complained of favored importations at the goldfielders’
expense. This went on until unregistered racing was
established forilocally-owned horses. Then the regis-
tered clubs found their power and prosperity slipping
away, and a compromise with the unregistered clubs
was forced on them. Since then, regular fortnightly
meetings have been held, and a trotting club has come
into existence. The competitors are all locally;owned,
trained and fed. But the;dry of the tradesman, that
he can’t get his accounts paid on account of the
races, is not heard to anything like the same extent.
The money now goes round. Some people get it—
probably not the most deserving people—but jt
doesn’t all go to fatten Perth.

The All Blacks had another easy gallop
against a London side on Saturday, winning, in
pouring rain and a quagmire, by 28 to 3. English
critics had just previously arrived at the conclusion
that' the tourists, were at their worst, in wet weather.
The English XY to play against the Maorilanders
next Saturday includes R. L. Raymond, of N.S.W.
and Oxford, who is to fill his old N.S.W. position of
wing-threequarter, whereas he has been appearing for
Oxford as fullback, a job he once held down at
Sydney Uni. Raymond's selection has roused some
criticism, including regrets that an Australian should
be chosen to represent England. Rather delayed,
this, for' Aussies have been doing it since the late
Gregory Wade wore the white jersey in the early
’eighties. In the wing position, Raymond’s exhibition
was a prominent factor in the defeat of the Maori-
landers by N.S.W. -in 1922, and unless English
“condition” has slowed him down, he will trouble
them at Twickenham. Still, the invaders should win
in any weather.

“A.IT.”; Following my par. about Eng-
land beating the 1889 team of Maorilanders by one
goal and four tries to nil, “Kicker” writes (B.
25/12/’24) that “seven points to nil was England’s
score.” Same thing, of course; at least it was then,
though it wouldn’t be now. Which reminds me
that a few weeks ago I read some comparisons, in
points, of the tallies scored by the present team
with those put up in the U.K. by their predecessors
of ’QS-’O6 and ’B9. With regard to the last, a
comparison, except in goals and tries, would obviously
be misleading, for 36 years ago a goal counted
three points and a try, one. I can’t remember the
exact year when the change came.
NOT DEAD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr. G. N. Kilduff, the N.S.W. Trotting Club’s
stipendiary steward, speaking at the Bathurst Trotting
Club’s banquet, said that he was certain that 75 per
cc-nt. of the so-called ‘dead ’uns’ were honest triers.
People who had their money, to excuse their
bad judgment, often blamed the owner and the driver,
declaring that a horse was ‘dead.’ ”
You hear no Ave, Ccesar, morituri!
At the beginning of a trotting race,
Yet, at the end, the punter’s sound and fury
Suggest it wouldn’t have been out of place ;
Also that only a coroner and jury
Could properly investigate the case.
It fills me with perpetual disgust
To find the public can be so unjust.
I hear the howls, an 1 catch myself detesting
The proneness to attribute something crook
Shown by the crowd whose rabbit-brained investing
On roughies is a godsend to the book.
They’ll swear a horse is dead that’s merely resting;
There are so many things they overlook,
When really ’tis themselves they ought to kick
For deeming all is dead that isn’t quick.
They are not dead who don’t bring home the bacon
Always, or stiff whose gait at times is slow.
And who so liable to be mistaken
As chaps who can’t be always in the know;
Who go to trots with golden dreams and waken
With badly shattered hopes and lessened dough
To constitute themselves the crucifters
Of gallant sportsmen and their honest triers?
They are not dead, these stigma-laden horses,
The prads u'ho can’t invariably trot
Ahead of whirling wheels round measured courses
To break a record or to land a pot.
The calumny recurrent simply forces
Me to assure you on my word they’re not.
At least —they are not dead to the extent
Of more than 25 or so per cent.

“T.V.T.” : The abilities of a certain estate
and commission agent were under discussion
as I entered the smoking carriage. “He’s
a pretty good salesman, isn’t he?” queried
one. “Salesman!” echoed the other. “Strutli,
he’d sell a side of bacon in a synagogue!”
“J.J.D.”: The regulation requiring wire-
less listeners-in to pay 355. for a license
presses very hardly on Young Australia. I
know a lad of 14 who has had to put aside
his pocket-money for months in order to get
the necessary license fee. Ilis receiving set
is crudely elementary—in all it cost 11s. Gd.
—yet he must pay the same as Mr. Money-
bags, who has installed a £lOO “loud speaker"
with which he entertains his friends. It is
inequitable business*; one might almost think
that the politicians wanted to discourage
young Marconis.
"FY7”: A new r development threatens the
cattle-duffing industry, and many a pioneer
may have to change his methods. The chief
vet. at Hawkesbury College (N.S.W.) has
perfected a system for identifying cattle by
their nose-prints, just as human beings can
he identified by their finger-prints. It will
be impossible to alter or fake a nose, and
even one’s brand on a cleanskin may not
avail if the brute has already had its nose
put on record. It is a disturbing outlook.
Still, one can imagine pleasanter jobs tharn
taking the nose-print of a maddened
“mickey” on a hot day and before a hostile
audience. The earlier experts will have mv
sympathy.
"J.G.E.”: “Bundy” need not remain a
moment longer in ignorance of what became
of the captain and crew of the four-masted
barque Inverness-shire, of Glasgow, which
was tow r ed into Port Stanley, Falkland
Islands, in 1010 (B. 13/11/’24). The miss-
ing men turned up in due course. After beat-
ing about Cape Horn for seven weeks and
losing several sails, the skipper had put hack
to the Falklands for a spell. He and
his men had gone ashore at Fanny Island,
leaving the vessel at anchor whilst they had
a rest ashore and gave the wind a Chance
to change. Meantime the tug came along,
found the barque desertedj and towed her into
Stanley as a derelict. They were, moreover,
awarded £3OOO for salvage. No > Marie
Celeste mystery- there.
“Ming”: The story is told of a recently-
deceased English plutocrat, It. Q. Rowatt,
that his wealth was mainly due to
the error of a clerk, who misread an
order for “six cases” of rum and
made it “six cargoes.” War took a
hand, and_ as Rowatt was the only spirit
merchant in a position to meet the sudden
huge demands of the British Army, he sold
the rum at an immense profit. This freak of
fortune is not unique. Recently a Sydney
firm in a rush moment entrusted a cable
to a junior typist, who misread the chief’s
handwriting in a quotation and substituted a
much higher figure, which was duly checked
by another junior. The high price was
accepted by an Adelaide house, and an as-
tounded firm cleared an unexpected profit
of £3900 over the deal, without mentioning
the matter to the two chiefly responsible.
“Ex-D.” : Judging by the police bulletins
which reach Sydney headquarters from the
outside world, Yankee prisons must be very
insecure cages. Not an American mail
arrives that doesn’t bring its parcel of
“wanted” sheets. The average contribution
is anything from 20 to 50, and over half of
these refer to men who have escaped from
gaol. Considering that Sydney doesn’t re-
ceive anything like the full list, a conserva-
tive estimate would suggest that at least 100
prisoners escape from prison in U.S.A.
weekly. An unfair percentage cast up in
Australia, although not as a rule until
months or years after their prison-breaking.
There is no record of any of them having
repeated their performances when laid by the
heels in this country; Bathurst, Long Bay,
Goulburn, Pentridge, Yatala and the Com-
monwealth’s other gaols hold them securely.
T ncle Sam has some odd notions about
lus Presidents and their deputies. As a rule
the man who becomes Vice-President is re-
garded as being politically finished, like the
elderly Australian politician who goes to the
London office. . But should the Vice step
into a dead President’s shoes, he is considered
to have a paramount claim to the party
nomination for another term. Thus was
Coolidge elected last week and Roosevelt in
1904. _ Another of Uncle’s traditions is that
tliei'e is a Presidential top-hat in every native-
born man-child’s cradle. In point of fact,
the. office is jealously reserved for Americans
deriving on the father’s side from the pioneer
stocks, English, Scotch, Dutch and Ulster
Irish. Not one of the 30 Presidents or
Vices has had South Irish, Italians, Ger-
mans, Russians, Roumanians or Slavs for
paternal ancestors, nor has any of them been
an R.C. Coolidge is a New Englander of
Puritan descent.
“Toby C.”: Some months ago the wire-
whiskered residents along the south-western
line (Q.) grew tired of the haphazard sys-
tem which merely provided that their goods
should be tumbled out at precarious sidings
by a tired guard, to be “lifted” by tramps
or other unscrupulous persons, and urged
the Government to erect receiving-sheds and
place them in charge of proper officers. The
request was regarded as reasonable, but
Theodore compromised by erecting the neces-
sary buildings and leaving it to the cockies
to appoint and support tlieir own porter.
The experiment is having a six-months’ trial,
by the end of which period the Department
will be able to judge (through checkings 1
whether the business of (say) Wallabandie
is important enough to be worthy the atten
tion of a gold-braided official or not. Before
the present system was initiated all the
cockies in some districts were at logger-
heads, each suspecting his neighbor of broach-
ing cargo at the siding. At one siding com-
plaints were so incessant that the Law was
commissioned to keep an eye on the station
for three nights; but as five cockies kept
an eye on the John from different angles no-
thing went astray that week. The new
scheme is thus far working satisfactorily
and the competition for the unofficial porter’s
job is almost as brisk as that for a Labor-
selection. At one siding a meeting was held
on Sunday, and of the 17 cockies present
all but two nominated. The aspirant with
the longest whiskers and the most intimate
knowledge of the intricacies of pig trucking-
topped the poll. ' *”

Wild, wet weather and the holiday pro-
bably accounted for the small crowd that
assembled at Sydney Palace to hear Thurs-
ton Hall and Iris party of American tourists
exclaim “So this is London !” on Boxing
Night; and regrets may have been felt jby
the’ principal performer for his moving-
picture days when he commanded audiences
of millions at the price of a few hours’ pos-
turing in front of a camera in a Los Angeles
studio. Nevertheless lie enjoyed the advant-
age, of being able to hear the applause, which
was plentiful. ' It was also well deserved,
for the slight but bright thing was excellently
done, and rattled along from farce through
burlesque to a sentimental finish without
any punctures. Whether it will justify its
claim of being an ambassador between the
mother country and the nation that lends
money at 31 to Britain arid to France
is another matter. There is internal evidence
that it was first written to tickle the palates
of the N’York groundlings and afterwards
bowdlerised for British consumption ; but its
darts are not poisoned and would hardly
penetrate the skin of a Maorilander. The
cast was good, and was divided between the
two opposing camps judiciously. Thurston
Hall, as the wealthy Hiram Draper, sen.,
come over to England for the first time to
buy a boot-factory, was accompanied by
Gladys Webster as his wife (in a wonderful
wig which might be de rigucur in New York
but would also be in order in Manchuria),
and his son, who on the voyage has clandes-
tinely betrothed himself to the daughter of
an Englishman who has earned a title by
making boots —as they were good boots he
probably deserved it. A London telephone
and a flunkey at the Ritz confirm the Ameri-
can father’s worst fears of the decadence
of the English, and his son’s announcement
of his engagement to a daughter of the
accursed race moves him to a description of
what the family will be like. A black-out
•ensues, and a “dream picture”—a device ner-
: fected by the moving-picture people—
materialises in which the English father,
mother and daughter, dressed in the Ameri-

can conception of English fashions, enter and
behave according to the American notion of
English behavior. Unfortunately when the
same trio reappear later in their proper place
in the plot their manners and appearance
are very little different from the American’s
iihagiriing, so that the point is lost. The
movie device is again employed to illustrate
the English father’s conception of an Ameri-
can domestic unit, but this time tlie bur-
lesque and the reality are widely separated.
As the usual large-jawed, masterful, rapa-
cious, sentimental, chivalrous, 100 per cent,
(per annum) American business man Thurs-
ton Hall was well in place, and Gladys Web-
ster capably discharged the duties of his wife,
though doubt may reasonably be expressed as
to . the possibility of her being the mother of
his grown-up son. Leslie Barrie and Mary
Macgregor displayed the rebellious spirit of
the younger generation with zest. Ailsa
Grahame, as Lady Ahiy Ducksworth, acted
the part of an international go-between with
vim and charm; but Reginald Carrington as
Sir. Percy Beauchamp was too grotesque a
caricature of an English gentleman, and his
lapse into tenderness at the thought of losing
his daughter to the ineffable Yankees failed
to convince. Joan Crossley, however, played
the part of Iris submissive spouse delightfully.
Kenneth Brampton, as the general manager
of the boot factory, was quiet and efficient,
and helped to restore this Page’s faith in the
future of British industry.

The Hadji Ivader Arabs, who answer the

piece of melodrama; and “Unguarded

playing an excessive timidity; and “The Ten

The reason why Chinese herbalists and
other discolored and white charlatans make
fortunes was supplied by the cheers, especi-
ally from the gallery, which greeted the sharp
criticisms of the medical fraternity when
“The Outsider” was staged at Melbourne
Royal on Saturday night. Apparently Lump
Sum has the sympathy of a large section
of the public; and the satire of the medical
character who opined that “some people be-
lieve Christ could work miracles because
lie was not a qualified practitioner” was to a
great extent lost on the audience. Anton
Ragatzy, a genius with a crude manner and
an ambitious spirit, has inherited his calling
as a surgical-instrument maker. To qualify
himself he studied anatomy cheaply by spend-
ing a year at the Chicago slaughteryards:
and when the play opens he has established
a great reputation for curing cripples who
have been declared incurable by leading doc-
tors. Upon his claim to recognition five arc-
lights of the medical profession sit in judg-
ment in “the Honorary Staff’s room” of a
London hospital, where Ragatzy exhibits a
hopeless cripple nearly cured. To avoid the
scandal the newspapers might make of it if
they decline to recognise the man who cures
where they fail, the great surgeons state im-
possible terms as the price of recognition.
Enraged, Ragatzy resolves to cure the crip-
pled daughter of Jasper Sturdee, the leading
surgeon among the five who have sat in judg-
ment on him. Forcing his way in to see her
he beats down resentment, playing upon her
passionate desire to marry Basil Owen so
subtly that eventually she decides to leave
her father’s house and undergo the treat-
ment. It is successful, but contact with a fine
woman nobly bearing her suffering has the
effect of softening Ragatzy. At the end of the
first interview he had resolved to make the
daughter’s cure advertise the humiliation of
the father; next he offers to effect the cure
for the cure’s sake and the satisfaction of
proving his ability to make it; and before the
end he gathers such a chastened spirit by
daily contact with the patient that love tri-
umphs as usual and alters all lxis courses.
The play, though it opens up fierce argu-
ment, inclines to many tearful and emotional
spasms. Even had the information not
given that the authoress is herself a cripple
it would be easy to guess that an authoress
was responsible, and that she had a grievance.
The play runs like a human self-revelation,
and in spite of glaring improbabilities and an
inclination to the melodramatic grips the
audience. For this the vivid interpretation by
Moscovitch of the flamboyant charlatan Anton
Ragatzy, wflio, under his vulgarity, has genius
and a' kind heart, is mainly responsible.
He had 12 recalls when the curtain fell on
the second act. Kay Souper was a dignified
Jasper Sturdee. and the not quite believable
Fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons who
discussed their failures were represented by
William Stack (Sir Nathan Israel), whose
manner of speaking is an irritation; Mac-
Ivenzie Rogan (Sir Montague Tollemachc),
Nat Madison and Greenaway. Basil Bowen
is a wishy-washy lover whose love never has
the real stamp of sincerity. Jean Robertson
is more appealing than convincing as Lalage
Sturdee; certainly it would be difficult to
make the character completely convincing.
Eileen Sparkes was Madame Ivlost, who
ceased to matter after she got over her fear-
ful tears in the first act; and Rosslyn Vane,
as a female servant, was responsible for the
sole bit of comedy—apart from the thrusts
of Ragatzy at the medical profession. It is
a steep descent from Shnkspeare; but Shy-
lock brought rather poor houses, and the
present comparative rubbish is likely to pay
the box-office better.
“Good Morning, Dearie,” danced into the
great heart of the public at Melbourne
Majesty’s on Boxing night, as much of the
public as could get into the theatre being
there for the express purpose of having its
heart danced into. The show is one that
travels mainly on its feet, although it _is
extremely well dressed arid is helped out with
plentiful if slight melody. A shy little orphan,
Rose-Marie, captivates the hearts of every-
body she meets, including an amazing
comedy crook who believes in treating ’em
rough,' and Billy Van Cortlandt, who, be-
sides owning a descent from the original Van
Cortlandts and possessing all, the money
other people have made for them, owns a
punch of his own which knocks the crook
out. In the course of its progress to the
end, when Rose-Marie foils the crook and his
pals in their attempt to make a big haul at
the home of Billy’s sister, and rests in Billy’s
arms waiting for the wedding bells, the story
trips into Hell’s Bells Dance Hall, where
the band shows all the symptoms of madness
of which a jazz band fed on wood alcohol is
capable. It was during the whirling excite-
ment of this scene that an audience which
had been spilling frequent and cheerful but
unemotional applause definitely decided that
it liked the ' play, and enthusiasm never
waned afterwards.

Josie Melville made slaves of her audi-
ence in a part in which the weakness of her
voice didn’t matter; in fact, it rather helped
out the illusion—Rose-Marie is supposed to
be a shy little shopgirl. Her acting was in-
telligent and her dancing—there was a lot
of it—very graceful. George Gee, who had
a wonderful welcome-back, was the timorous

William Blayds-Conway drinks the 90th-
birthday health of Oliver Blayds (Dion
Boucicault and C. M. Hallard).
private-detective Simmons, who supplied a
good deal of the laughter with the aid of
Chesty Costello, played burlesquishly by
George Crotty, whose astonishing clothes
would make him liable to arrest for offensive
behavior in any well-regulated city, and by
Dan Agar as Gimpy. Noel Leyland made
himself liked as Billy de Cortlandt, and tlie
Madame Bompard of Rosemary Rees was a
strikingly good- representation of the large-
hearted Irishwoman fitted with bad French.
Misquette and Maxley provided a thrilling
Apache dance in the dance-hall scene; ami
the Australian Sunshine Girls, in two of
their turns especially—the “Coolie Dance”
and “Le Sport American” —prompted loud
recalls. The production deserved the praise
which was showered upon George Highland
when that bashful but competent producer
was dragged on to the stage, amongst the
flowers and massed performers, to accept the
congratulations of a very pleased house.
Out of consideration for the vast numbers
of people who would like to go to Honolulu
but can’t afford it, Honolulu has been brought
to Melbourne. The “Hawaiian Trouba-
dours,” who opened at the new Atheiueuin
Theatre on Boxing Day, gave an entertain-
ment that carries amongst its recommenda-
tions the charm of being something different.
This Showman doubted beforehand whether
the Troubadours could make a whole-night
entertainment of the sort of thing that is an
agreeable single turn in a variety bill; but
they did it. In artistically conceived settings
of idealised Hawaiian scenery, a medley of
songs, in the Hawaiian and American lan-
guages, was served to the tinkling of ukuleles ;
and there was a plentiful sauce of Hawaiian
dances, in which Gertila Byrnes shone best.
Queeuie Kaili, a stout dark lady with a
smile which is humor in itself, was made
the popular favorite; but the whole company
worked well.

In exposing “The Truth About. Blayds,”
Melbourne King’s seems to have struck a
fairly good patch, and “Trelawny of the
Wells” has been put back on the shelf for
a while. The fact that “The Truth” fades
away rather tiresomely in the last act, where
the author was puzzled to know what to do
with the problem he had created, has had
little apparent effect upon attendances, which
have been wonderfully good.

If Clem Dawes, who provides most of the
fun in “The Midnight Frolics,” is prepared to
call his perspiring work at the Melbourne
New Palace a frolic, why should we com-
plain? It is impossible to describe the little
show as first-class, but it includes numerous
attractive-looking girls and much light humor,
which is capable of providing a good even-
ing’s entertainment for those who are not
hypercritical. The best thing to be said

about the show is that it moves rapidly, and
the tribulations of some of the acts can be
forgotten in the enjoyment of others. But
not the copy of Harry Tate’s motor-car busi-
ness —that is too cheap to be either for-
gotten or forgiven.

The Melbourne Repertory Society’s repeti-
tion of “Dear Brutus” at the housewarming
of the new Melbourne Athenaeum was a really
finished performance. The players improved
on their previous good record; on this occa-
sion a specially-distinguished bit of work, up
to first-class professional standard, was done
by _ Miss Maisie Bennett as Mrs. Dearth,
while Miss Ceridwen Kelly repeated her suc-
cess as the dream daughter of Will Dearth. In
this male character Helton Daniell was again
good; indeed, no complaint of any conse-
quence can be made against any member of
the cast. The performance was preceded by
the playlet “Augustus in Search of a
Father.”
** * *
Tom Brown, who burnt-corks his expres-
sive countenance, and five brothers, who
whiten theirs to accord with clown costumes
and traditions, have sprung to an instant
popularity at Melbourne Tiv., where they
are showing what can be done with the saxo-
phone. They are armed with all the sizes
of instruments down (or up) to a real ele-
phant of a weapon with amazing bass tones;
the lively sextette can even hold conversa-
tions by means of them. The Daros are a
queer pair; the lady has a voice like some
that have been heard on bottle-carts, but
her singing is merely the padding in an act
of thrill, in which she does sensational things
on a ladder _ supported on the head of her
muscular friend. There are several good
new turns, and an old one which is tire-
some—that of Laveen and Cross, whose bur-
lesque was only bearable when it was new.

The first of the two farewell concerts of
Melba’s Grand Opera artists occurred on
Christmas night at Melbourne Majesty’s, and
some indigestion seemed to have got into the
programme. It did not make much differ-
ence to the audience, which, in a Christ-
massy spirit, had brought along its presents
of applause and duly gave them; but it made
the concert very ragged. Apollo Granforte
was the hero, and gathered a crescendo of
applause, which became a tumult after he
sang the “Toreador Song” (“Carmen”) in
the second part; but he had to pay for it—
three extras were demanded of him, and
even then the audience was reluctant to part
with him. Phyllis Archibald had her best
success in “Stride La Vampa” (“II Trova-
tore”). Piccaluga and Augusta Concato were
erratic. Schiavoni made an admirable accom-
panist. The final concert on Saturday night
was at the Town Hall.
Melbourne Philharmonic gave the usual
Christmastide offering of “The Messiah,” and,
mainly by the grace of Amy Castles, it was
a much better performance than the recent
“Israel in Egypt.” The soprano solos were
naturally the outstanding feature, not the
less so because the artist did not allow the
religious character of the oratorio to depress
her. Her operatic rendering of both arias
and recitatives was interesting and appeal-
ing. G. Theston Morphet, who was respon-
sible for the bass solos, came very little short
of the success of the soprano; but Miss Vic-
toria Anderson, although she has a fine con-
tralto, and Norman Bennett were not very
commendable. The chorus lost itself in some
passages; and the orchestra, although rising
to great heights at times, at others showed
an independence of spirit more conspicuous
than admirable. Three performances were
given, the last on Christmas night.
“The Reckless Age,” featuring Reg
Denny, and Bebe Daniels, in “Unguarded
Women,” a picture which should hold a
moral or something of the sort for St. Kilda
grass-widows, are the two features that will
see the Old Year out and the New Year in
at Hoyt’s de Luxe, Melbourne. At the
Majestic Monte Bank rushes like a tornado
through “Racing Luck.” which is backed by
“The Masked Dancer.”

Humphrey Bishop’s co. in the open-air at
Adelaide Exhibition Gardens contains a real
humorist with a personality, George Ross; a
beautiful woman, Ngaire Phipson ; and some
clever song-and-dance people. Also an O.
Henry story is recited and goes well. A
similar show under Billy Maloney is open-
ing at Austral Gardens, and more varied
variety cos. are on at the Royal and the
Majestic—the latter under George Wallace,
who is really funny. Oratorio and good con-
certs are everywhere, and Reeves signalises
the Christmas season by reciting Dickens at
length. In pictures the York has, in “Hearts
of Oak.” fine views of storm on the New
England coast, with three well-meaning
people making each other more miserable
than could any improbable villain. At West’s
is the dog “Rin-tin-tin,” a pack in himself;
and Wondergraph varies from motor-racing
thrills to Gloria Swanson, making love and
scandal in the over-dressed condition which
has a sure appeal for a feminine audience.

“Stage Wait”: The Portia and the An-
tonio in Moscovitcli’s production of “The
Merchant of Venice” are Australians who
have made good abroad. Perhaps that is why
the press-agent dismisses them in a line or
two while he reserves a wealth of adjectives
and big type for small-part importations.
Apropos, the husband in “The Green God-
dess,” impersonated here by an American
actor, was originally played in New York
by the Australian Cyril Keiglitley, and in
Chicago by Leonard Wiley, also an Austra-
lian. I suppose it would never have done
to engage either of these Australians for the
Australian presentation of an Australian
native’s play.
“Hamfat”: An actor-r whose clothing is the
latest from London, and who talks l.oftily
about his “art,” coincided in a Maoi’iland city
with Stiffy and Mo. Meeting Mo at the race-
course he fraternised patronisingly with the
cheerful Yid, but was somewhat impressed
when, as they were passing Jellicoe, the lat-
ter recognised Mo with a smile. “Looks as if
he knows you,” said the exponent of Art. “I
wonder who he imagines I am?” “Oh, he
thinks you’re Stiffy,” remarked Stiffy’s part-
ner. Irving’s successor has not got over it
yet.
Those people who linger at stage-doors for
a hurried close-up glimpse of their footlight
favorites can meet all the “stars” in a much
more comfortable manner through the
Woman’s Mirror. The current issue contains
a chat with Emma Temple, and the expendi-
ture of threepence weekly will bring theatri-
cal patrons on close terms with other actors
and actresses. And that is only one of a
dozen sections of interest to women.
“Peter Pan”: This is the day of the male
star in Australia. Guy Bates Post, Thurs-
ton Hall, Seymour Hicks, Maurice Mosco-
vitch, John D. O’Hara and Allen Doone hold
the electric signs of six different theatres, and
Alfred Frith has broken musical comedy tra-
ditions —in which pride of advertising place
is invariably given to something in tights or
skirts—by being displayed as the first attrac-
tion of “Betty.” Irene Vanbrugh and Dion
Boucicault, likewise Muriel Starr and Frank
Harvey, are co-starred. The only two slie-
luminaries in sight at present are Gladys
Moncrieff and Josie Melville.
“Flaming Youth”: It hasn’t seemed like a
real pantomime season in Melbourne without
Edmund Fisher. Fisher held such a unique
position in the field of theatrical criticism
that, after his deatli in May, it was a matter
for wonder how his place might be filled, and
for a couple of months no definite step in the
direction of filling it was taken. Up to his
last hour Fisher was the man solely respon-
sible for the theatrical criticisms appearing
in The Bulletin from Melbourne; and he
was so justly jealous of the reputation lie
had established that he was, even in the
most strenuous times, reluctant to allow any
of his work to be attempted by an under-
study. There were times when he dragged
himself out of a bed of sickness to avoid it;
for his honesty as a critic made him object to
meretricious “smartness” which might do a
player an injustice. His brilliancy provided
a light from which anyone associated with
him might steal a glow; but its wholesale
pilfering to furnish the reputation of an-
other has stirred the indignation of a host of
Melbourne friends.
“T. 0.1.”: Letters from England announce
that wonderful old Mrs. G. B. W. Lewis is
making light of her 81 years, 36 of which she
spent in Australia. Strange as it seems, she
was a favorite with men who fought against
Napoleon. As far back as 1851 she appeared
with G. V. Brooke as the Child in “The
Stranger,” and while the Crimean War was
raging she made a hit at Sadler’s Wells as
Puck in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,”
Samuel Phelps’s production. In Melbourne
Mrs. Lewis formed a “Pinafore” juvenile
combination, in which her son George played
Captain Corcoran. George became an archi-
tect, but abandoned that profession for music.
When I last heard of him he was musical
director at the London Palladium. Another
of the “Pinafore” juveniles was Mary Weir,
now Mrs. .T. C. Williamson.
MUCH ADO.
“Wunnerful thing, this wireless. We were listening-in to ‘Hamlet’
last night, and distinctly heard the cries for ‘Author.’”
“Hamfat” : Chatting with a friend of mine,
Moscovitch admitted having played Shylock
hundreds of times. “Good Lord !” exclaimed
my cobber, “you must have a splendid edge
on that knife you sharpen in the last act!”
“Abbot Park”: “Cresar’s Ghost” (B.
18/12/’24) points out that Melbourne Phil-
harmonic is a point behind its sister society
in Sydney in the race for the hundredth per-
formance of “The Messiah.” But the Mel-
bourne body holds pride of place in date of
formation; also, it put Handel’s well-worn
work on at its initial concert in 3853.
The Sydney Phil, started a year later, but
has some gaps in its history, the pre-
sent organisation dating from 1885. Old-
timers used to get “The Messiah” in full,
and a 00-year-old Melbourne criticism ends
with: “The time occupied was four and a
half hours, but scarcely anyone left before
the end.” I am afraid most of them would
be gone half-way through these days.
“Barnstormer”: The old “premium” ama-
teur, once of some use to impecunious man-
agers but a nuisance to professionals, still
exists. One I met the other day told me
that he had paid premiums six times, the
amount varying from £25 to £75. Appa-
rently every recipient of the bounty dropped
him as soon as it could decently be done;
but the aspiring amateur remains hopeful.
When I suggested that he must find the
thing expensive he protested that it was
“a good investment. When they discover
my worth, and I get one of these three-figure
salaries, it’ll all come back in a couple of
weeks.” Touched by his simple faith, I let
him keep his illusion.
“Barnstormer”: Just-dead John de Lacey
came to Australia with the Sanford Drama-
tic Co., which had a disastrous tour about
20 years ago, and spread its wreckage on
these shores. John was a useful utility
actor in a multitude of small parts; but his
voice, a deep bass, was trying to some people
when he was essaying the leading “heavy.”
I remember seeing him as Legree when the
Sanfords played “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” at
Sydney Lyceum to a painfully empty house.
As a substantial part of the d.-c. audience
arose and disgustedly began to remove his
creaky boots from the theatre, a woman,
stirred by some new atrocity on Legree’s
part, exclaimed, “Cruel beast!” The boots
paused for a moment. “Madam,” said a
voice somewhere above them, “the wretch
who inflicts a voice like that upon a defence-
less audience is worse than cruel!” Then
the boots continued their musical progress
towards Pitt-street.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Forty-fifth-rate drama-
tists are generally responsible for the queen-
ideas about Australia and Australians which
sometimes appear on the British stage. But
at least one of the first-flighters is
not exempt from blame. Alfred Sutro
in “The Walls of Jericho” made his
freeborn Australian hero a man who
looked and felt out of place in a ballroom.
Having come from the great open spaces of
Potts Point or thereabouts he would natu-
rally feel like that.
“ Dave 11. R.”:
I am cultivating
the friendship of
the local J. Hop
with the idea of in-
•ducing him to
arrest a wandering
fiickergraph ma-
chine or a peripa-
tetic film on a
charge of having
no lawful visible
means of support.
Then W air u s-
w h i s k e r s, P.M.,
will decide whether
it is legal to sell
an audience half a
story on the repre-
sentation that it is
getting the com-
plete yarn. At
numerous travelling
pitcher-shows I
have visited during
the last couple of
years the machines
wore in such a de-
crepit state that
the business was
nothing but a series
of hiatuses, with
portions of differ-
ent films appearing
like wadis in an
Arab desert. When
this wasn’t the case
the films used were
torn or cracked to
such an extent that
it took a power of
guessing to make
out what they were
all about. It is the
custom of these
wandering concerns
to show one night
in a town and then
steal to the next, so
the ancient hen-
fruit and wilted
greenery the tricked bushies collect for the
second performance go to waste.
“Abbot P.”: Tradition, as quoted by
“Topee” (B. 18/12/’24), is a lying jade if it
says that Bottesini “used a very small five-
stringed bass.” Papini, the Italian violinist
who toured with Bottesini, records that the
latter used a full-size model by Testore, and
it was a three-stringer. Bottesini was em-
phatic about that; he was always against the
addition of the fourth string: the extensive
treatise he wrote is for the three-string bass.
I doubt if a five-stringer existed in Bottesini’s
time. These instruments came in quite re-
cently to gratify the fancy of Strauss and
Elgar and others who wrote lower notes than
their forerunners. Ceschina’s instrument,
too, was a small one: I’ve seen it too often
to have any doubt.
“Nimslii” : “Exile” has got his dates mixed
when he says (B. 11/12/’24) that Harry
Lauder appeared anonymously, and as an
extra turn, at the London Pav. in 1901.
Harry was “beaming and prosperous” years
before this century dawned. I myself saw
him head the bill in Douglas, Isle of Man, in
the middle ’nineties.
“Tekke”: Perhaps it is lucky for the
Turkomans of Central Asia that Melba did
not hear their criticisms of her vocal powers.
Lieut.-Colonel P. T. Etherton took a gramo-
phone with him on a recent journey to those
parts, and the first selection he put on for
his unsophisticated hosts was a song by the
diva-dame. Asked how they liked it the
children of the desert declared that they
thought it was an old woman crying.
A CRUSTY CRITIC’S CODE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“In the preface to his book, ‘The Organised
Theatre,’ St. John Ervine, the Irish playwright, an-
nounces that he ‘will not waste time in being- polite
to persons who are not entitled to politeness.’ ”
I hate the whole dashed mob of them, the low-
down theatre men
(Although it’s true they’ve given me a look in now
and then)
Who turn the Fane of Art into a sordid gambling
den!
What’s Art to them, or honor, or uprightness?
Strong language? Well, it is, perhaps. I mane it,
for I’ve tried,
With no success, those showmen in the proper path
to guide;
Why should I speak urbanely of the folk I can’t abide.
When they are not entitled to politeness?
I will not be polite to them!
Their faults I will recite to them—
The rotters aren’t entitled to politeness!
Instead of staging plays like mine, of which I’m justly
woud,
They will insist on putting on revues to please the
crowd;
They say it pays them better—faugh ! It shouldn’t
be allowed,
This trading in bare limbs and tripe and trite-
ness.
While Vital Drama vainly for a fit reception begs,
Their gloating eyes are focussed cn the chorus-ladies'
legs;
Not one of them deserves bouquets, so now I’m
flinging eggs ;
The blayguards wouldn’t undtherstand politeness 1
I will not be polite to them,
It’s here I’m showin’ fight to them—
To Hell wid all the tribe and their “politeness” !

Correct Street Lighting
Adds Beauty
MANY of the inventions of man mar nature’s beauty. This
is not true of Electric Light. It brightens the dark cor-
ners of the city and brings pleasure to the heart by its efful-
gent glow. It is man’s substitute for sunshine, a light without
waste, entirely consuming the force that feeds it.
The Westinghouse engineers, not content with giving elec-
tricity for utility alone, have also embellished the mediums
through which it is furnished to harmonize with their sur-
roundings and fit into the picture as something beautiful be-
sides useful. This was the thought that led to the adaptation
of the graceful Corinthian columns for street lighting.
Westinghouse street lighting is a system of correct and
ornamental illumination.
In arranging for the distribution of its products in Australia,
Westinghouse will be pleased to hear from firms interested in
acting as distributors.

THE INKY WAY.
“Lond.”: The law about snapshotting strangers has
been laid down. Any amateur has a right to photo-
graph bathers or other persons, even though they
may protest. He may sell such pictures to news-
papers, they being his copyright, or otherwise do
with them as he pleases, unless such display or use
exposes the subjects to such notice or ridicule as
may prejudice their official, commercial or social
positions. The use, without permission, of bathing
snapshots in a competition for prizes has been held
a libel under the “social position prejudiced” head.
As the Judge said on that occasion, the law mav
be taken as a practical working of the Golden Rule:
“Never publish a snapshot of others that you wouldn't
like them to publish of you.”
“Hamer”: My pet typographical error was in the
dear old S. M. Herald. A waterside identity, long
retired, had fallen into the water from the man-o’-war
steps; two days later he died. Recording the
incident the Herald reported that the old man “died
yesterday from shick, following his immersion.”
The Australian Museum Magazine is easily the
most interesting of the popular scientific periodicals
published locally, and the Jan.-March number is as
good as its predecessors. For one shilling the lay-
men can get on intimate terms with the nature life
of his own country without having to wade through
purely academic treatises.
The most promising of Adelaide’s caricaturists is
Kerwin Maegraith, a local lad not long out of his
’teens, whose work has appeared a good many times
lately in The Bulletin. He is ambidextrous, and
when putting a person’s features on to paper he
would just as soon use the left hand as the right. \s
usual with these caricaturists, he started on the
evil course in his school class: they were the masters
at St. Peter’s who suffered in this case.
“Dora Wilcox”: 1 wonder if The Bulletin would
let me mention that the legend upon which I founded
my short story “On the Cliffs at Okeruru,” which
appeared in the Christmas Bulletin, is to be
found in a collection made by the late 11. C. Jacobson,
founder and editor of the Akaroa Mail. A third and
enlarged edition of the book has been published by
Miss Jacobson, her father’s able successor in the
editorial chair.
Poor old James Francis Hogan, ex-member of the
House of Commons—“J.F.H.’ of The Bulletin’s
circle of London contributors —didn’t have a happy
ending. He died at a Doughty-street boarding-house,
where he had lately engaged a room. At an inquest
the landlady said he was of queer habits and,
although ill, refused to see a doctor or allow friends
to be sent for. They were poor lodgings; yet
evidence was given that he had an account at the
Union Bank —not much, but enough to live on. The
Coroner said it was a case of death from natural
causes.
“Simon”: What about a new punctuation mark to
denote sarcasm ? Years ago, when N.S.W. Speaker
Willis obligingly kept the Laborites in .power by
taking the chair, his Liberal colleagues, especially
nr. Arthur, frothed at the mouth. The little doctor
in w'hat was intended to be a devastating speech
once referred to Willis as “a psychological Speaker”—
there when he was wanted —and a “sphinx-like oracle
capable of propounding rulings the like of which
were never previously heard.” Willis had the speech
printed and circulated in his electorate under the
caption “Speaker Willis’s ability generously praised.”
“Hamer”; It took a lot to reconcile the London
papers to the use of “Digger”—they evidently
doubted whether the term mightn’t be regarded as
offensive. I believ-e I was responsible for some of
the reconciling. In most of my earlier copy about
A.I.F. affairs, “Digger” would be blue-pencilled into
“Australian soldier”; one desperately conventional
editor even made one of my Aussies address another
as “Chum.” London Evening News was the first
paper to be convinced; and when no explosion fol-
lowed, the papers overworked the word —to our dis-
gust some of them applied it to Canadians as well
as the dinkums.
“Hambone”: The relations between the Ma State
gallery hands and parliamentarians at the conclusion
of the pre-Christmas session were distinctly strained.
The reporters had been obliged to listen to several
tirades against the papers they represented, Bruxner,
the Cockies’ boss, being particularly acrimonious, and
the press campaign against the railway-pass grab
embittered the lawmakers further. The pressmen’s
umbrage was registered by non-attendance at the
seasonal farewell gathering. Memories of scurvy treat-
ment at the corresponding function last year and
the fact that no invitations had been received on
this occasion were other factors in their decision.
After the shivoo had started some limelight-hunter
found that the press was absent, and one of Fuller's
henchmen was sent post-haste with an entreaty that
the newspaper men would cumalonganavone. But even
that inducement failed to bring them.
HER FAULT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
To outward view she’s passing fair,
The girl round whom I hang
(Unlike the bit of bone and hair
That Hartley Coleridge sang) ;
But whatsoe’er her skull contains
I’m positive it isn’t brains.
Her gait is full of queenly grace
That none could fail discern;
Her beautifully chiselled face
Would make a sculptor turn.
It gets between the lines I write,
Or struggle with, from night to night.
With such a mouth as she has got,
In tender mood or gay,
A chap might think she’d have a lot
Of charming things to say—
Words that the slowest pulse would stir,
Like those 1 lavish upon her;
Phrases that I could treasure up,
Albeit the theme is old,
Like this man hoards a Sevres cup
Or that a cup of gold ;
Something at least, from time to time,
To ginger up a bit of rhyme.
She never does. She never did.
I doubt she ever will.
Whatever in her head is hid,
She breathes no word to thrill.
Of outward charms I grant her stacks;
It’s just ideas that she lacks.
For all the incense that I bring,
The passion that I pour,
She never says a single thing
I haven’t heard before.
She sometimes makes me think I’d own
As soon as her a gramophone.
Her profile’s gloriously Greek,
And that is why it cuts
To find that when she’s moved to speak
She cannot talk for nuts. '
She has, I swear, a lovely face;
But oh! the banal commonplace,
The sentiment frayed thin and fine,
The halting platitude,
With which she mocks these ears of mine
Whene’er she’s being wooed!
It might give any bard the blues,
Such an exasperating Muse.

your Ode to the Sydney No-Water Board will be
as much as it can stand :
Muddle and fuddle, talk and yap,
Wasting their time, the public purse.
“Hang up that hose, turn off the tap,
The dam’s damned low, and may be worse.”
The bottles stand upon the board
Holding Cook’s River’s vintage high.
A howl came from the public horde;
“Take out the corks, and let them die.’’
. ...J.H.M.: Your hero “chucked a six”; your
story “chucked a seven”... .C.F.: “Cake” insuffici-
ently baked.. . .W.E.8.: Try an insurance co

see if he can tell us what it’s all about H.M.:

weak in others and too 10ng....A.L. (Vic.): Your
tract on soft drinks and women fails to touch u 5....

thunder, lightning and villain... .J.C.A.: Simplicity

and you’ll get in all right....N. Bourne: You make
both of them unattractive.... Sloman: If it is Christ-
mas that makes you do it, then we can understand
why Christmas comes but once a year... .2050:
Incoherent, and rather too didactic... .N. M. Sniper:
It just missed. The dream idea is a bit overworked.
.... Mollie D.: Too many weak lines. But it has
merit.... .5.R.8.: Flat, stale and unprofitable....
R.R.: Let her go:—
TO MY FIRST AND FONDEST LOVE.
Oh my Australia!
My great wide land of mountain range and plains,
Dreadful droughts, and fires, and all-destroying rains,
Whose every mood I’ve always seemed to love
Since those dim days, when, distant skies above,
O’er cush’ning leaves or bare burnt earth I rambled,
Traced little lonely creeks,
On scrubby mountains scrambled,
Singing my boyish love
Of Thee.
.... Scherzando: “Place” is too obscure for that
sort of verse. .. .Hopkins River; You lose yourself
too often... .T.W.R.: As a specimen of verse in the
new manner we know nothing to beat it: —
POISE.
The fair aplomb;
And, contra,
The word or vain repetition of a word
That may
Destroy the balance and damn
With vulgarity what in the main
Is proper and quite inoffensive.
.... Maylice: Some music in it, but so meaningless,
... .W.C.H.; There is no grip in it. .. .Politico:
It won’t do. You write as you think we want you
to write, whereas The B. really wants its contri-
butors to be themselves... .Runnymede: As late as
1824 the Protective; duties on the- most important
manufactures in Britain were, between 50 and 80 p.c.
Then, “Freetrade” started; but even under the second
“Freetrade” tariff of 1833 leather goods, for instance,
still had protection of. 75 p.c L.S.A.: Thanks,
but the Heavens seem to have rained sonnets latelv,
and we’ve put up our umbrella,.. .Mick Fray:
Thanks: but it'll be sufficient just to tell “C. Coral”
that the Windhover was a ship, registered at Glas-
gow, well known in Australian ports in the 'seventies,
and more or less famous for a 45-days’ run from ;
Newcastle to ’Frisco in 1887 ... .L.L.M.; No use
taking a lame piece of prose and writing it to
look like verse.... Lorna W.: Whether, the bull-frog
secs you or doesn't matters little when you put
your questions in such bald verse.. . .G. 8.8.: Your
“sonnet” has no resemblance to the genuine article.
... .A.L.M.; Doesn’t say -enough.... Mary L.: They
miss, but you are on the way... .F.A.H.: Parodies
are generally evil things, but yours has a little
point. Still, “done” and ’’home” won’t rhyme in
December... .Cox; “Adventure” merely states a few
facts in print-worn phrases.. . .A.L.J.: Not a winner
by several furlongs.... Rita C.: Stiff and unattrac-
tive; and what on earth are “dats of happiness”?
You don’t happen to mean “rats”?.. . .C.C.M.: A
poor attempt.... Bellerive: The merry Mrs.- Wilton
sings her stave: —
Mrs. Wilton clenched her fist,
Her anger wild did swell,
At the news her Tom was drunk
In the bar of Mac.’s Hotel.
“He’d drink a brewery dry,” she raved,'
“When once he does begin;
Ten to one he’s left he’s job—
Just wait till he comes in.”
He imagines I will wash and iron,
But he'll find a snag in Me;
I’ll slave not for a wayward man
Who breaks out on the spree.
After dark he’ll stagger home,
And try to start a din ;
I’ll pull the rascal’s whiskers out—
Just wait till he comes in.
M.S. (South Melb.); “Illusion” doesn’t put it
very we 11... .P.P.P. r Nice verse, but it covers too
much old ground.... Hilda C.: “The Bush Week-
ender” lias called that log-hut paradise too often—-
mostly in lame verse A.E.H.: An old, old yarn
in halting lines... .J.G.: The “Toon” got here too
late... .R.W.T.: | You don’t make it intelligible....
G.D.S.: “Sand and Clay” don’t quite make an
acceptable brick.... Lily B.; Doesn’t get to any-

G.W.W.: In spite of the beautiful lettering, we are

TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
D. 0.: Your suburban parlor joke doesn’t fit your
bushies; but there’s promise in your drawing....
0.H.A.; If they are no better than the one sub-
mitted they won’t get a look-in, anyway. Drawings
should be twice as. large as they will be when
reproduced.... .C.L : Strange, ectoplasmic emanations
without explanation 8.5.: Your effigy 40 hands
high, which may be a man leading an object 4 hands
high, which may be a horse, isn’t a success
J.N.K.; Rather wooden 0.E.: We’ll struggle
along without it ... .H.M.8.; Misadventure in blue
ink unusable.. . .Kit: If you’ve got ideas for draw-
ings, they are worth money whether you can draw
or not. There is always a market here for suggestions.
“Budge”: We all sympathise with the
country-dwellers in their claim for better
roads, but why don’t they label the ones
they have got? Business recently took me
to Numurkah from Corowa, along with a
couple of old residents of the latter town.
We spent hours trying to pick up the right
road at various intersections; in 130 miles
there was not one direction-post. And con-
ditions are worse rather than better in N S
Wales.

Dear Sir, —
It will be of interest to you to know that the Model
200 One-Ton Isko Refrigerating Machine which you
supplied to this Hotel in January last is proving an
unqualified success.
It has been in operation now for the past twelve
months, and the Thermostatic control is functioning
perfectly, stopping the machine when the desired
temperature is reached, and re-starting it when the
temperature again rises. The machine carries on
quite automatically, and we have not found it neces-
sary to go near it.
My Chef tells me that he is more than pleased with
the condition of the perishable foodstuff's which the
“ISKO” Hikes care of, which I attribute to the dry
refrigeration of the “ISKO” as opposed to the cold,
moist air of the old-fashioned ICE Chamber.
Although, as you know, the machine is only about
22 feet from my office, I sometimes do not hear it
running, as it is very silent in operation. To my
mind, this is a most important feature in my busi-
ness.
Believe me,
Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir, —
In response to your inquiry, I will state that we
purchased our small Isko Refrigerating Machine some
four to five years ago, and it has been working, when
the weather has been ut all warm, ever since. As you
know, we use this machine for cooling chocolates, and,
as you may also know, we have at all times over-
loaded our Isko; in fact, our work really calls for a
refrigerator of at least one-half-ton capacity. How-
ever, the Isko has served us up to date.
We consider our Isko a wonderful little machine
and would not consider parting with It, except It
be replaced by a much larger capacity machine. We
have never had any trouble whatever with our Isko.
At a later date we hope to make some Improvements
in our Chocolate factory, and hope to And use for
your larger model Isko.
Yours truly,

I have much pleasure In stating that the “ISKO”
Refrigerating Plant you installed for us some months
ago has been working to our uniform and entire satis-
faction.
The machine is clean, noiseless, and so far lias
proved 100% efficient, and, moreover, has called for
the minimum of attention on the part, of our staff 1 .
We consider it an ideal installation for our busi-

island boys; after Christmas they will get
£3 10s. a month and found as the minimum.

“Centurion” : The last British census re-
turns show that lovely woman is steadily
invading new spheres. A hundred and fifty
have taken up the cheerful job of under-
taker, while no less than 73 are acknow-
ledged bookmakers. One is hardly prepared
for 500 female bargees or 23 lady chimney-
sweeps. Other out-of-the-way jobs taken up
by women are plumbing, riveting, and, of
all crafts, gunsmithing.
* * * *
“Pip Tok” : The Westralian Turf Club had
better fortune than the Brisbane Coukiek
(B. 11/12/’24) in discovering something of
value under a building site. When the
foundations were being dug for the Club's
new premises on the Perth Esplanade, the
workmen unearthed not gold, but a valuable
clay bed. The Wunderlich Co. bought the
clay and obligingly excavated it, paying tne
Turf Club something like £2700 for the privi-
lege.
* * * *
“Saaedi”: English fur-traders have sug-
gested that Australia should start a rabbit-
breeding industry. Rabbit-skins are ex-
pected to be very valuable in the near future,
and the suggestion is made that certain areas
should be set apart in which a superior type
of bunny could be bred. The objection is
that rabbits don’t thrive on inferior grazing
country. The region in which rabbits breed
most prolifically is usually good pastoral
country, and the sheep will take a lot of
beating as a money-maker in such areas.
* * * *
“F. J.E.” : Whatever may be the ultimate
fate of the Commonwealth fleet of steamers,
at least two of those built locally will re-
main in the coastal trade. The Echuca,
the largest vessel constructed by Walkers,
Ltd., Maryborough (Q.), and the Enoggera,
launched at Walsh Island by the Prince of
Wales during his Australian tour, have been
purchased by the A.U.S.N. Co. The Enog-
gera carries in her saloon a brass-plate bear-
ing the Prince’s crest. The Echuca is to
be re-named the Mareeba, and the Enoggera
will become the Mildura, the original bearers
of those names in the A.U.S.N. fleet having
become casualties many years ago.
“Yerri” : The barren gumlands of the north
of Maoriland have been considered very little
of an asset, b’;t now that certain areas have
proved profitable for fruit-growing there
seems a chance of utilising these scrub-
covered lands. The latest development is
tobacco-growing; the earliest product is
already marketed and the flavor pronounced
excellent. Grape-fruit is another experiment,
and as shaddocks can be produced success-
fully there seems no reason why the aristo-
crat of the family should not flourish as well.
An attempt is to be next made with pine-
apples. and should this fruit like the ground
and climate a ready market is assured, for
the crop.
“Sturt": An Adelaide Court has been con-
sidering whether eating supper is an “amuse-
ment” within the meaning of the Act. An
old-boys’ dance was run on the frugal basis
of Is. 6d. for admission and 3s. 6d. for supper.
Tickets were perforated and could be sold
separately, though apparently everybody except
the taxation official paid the ss. as a matter
of course. The Commissioner of Taxes argued
that supper is “practically an essential part”
of a dance, and so taxation should be levied
on the complete ticket; but the Court held
that the food was sold “for a reasonable
charge from which little or no profit could be
expected,” and that only the admission fee
could be taxed.
* » * *
“Panama”: The Cramer method of pre-
serving tropical fruits, by dipping them in
rubber latex, sounds as though there might
be something doing with our tropical fruits
before long in the European market. New
Guinea grows the rubber, and, according to
report, would do better business if there
was a market for it in Australia. By this
method the fruit remains exactly the same
as when dipped, the total exclusion of air
preventing any kind of chemical change.
Strawberries and the mangosteen have been
successfully shipped across the world after
being dipped in latex, and they are most diffi-
cult fruits to handle. Only those living in
the tropics know what a pawpaw really is.
The mottled abominations that Sydney sees
are not the golden-colored luscious and fra-
grant fruit that ripens under the tropic sun.
Treated under the Cramer method, ripe paw-
paws would reach, not only Sydney, but Lon-
don—where they would retail in the West
End shops at a guinea each. At present up
north they rot where they fall in thousands.
* * -K- *
“C.0.M.” : The lock was made in Sweden.
The price was high, but it seemed worth it.
It was a lock which could be put on without
a mortice, and in this saving of labor lay its
chief attraction. Then the trouble began
to develop. It was impossible to fix the
handles without cutting out a large part
of the door; for though the latter was only
of an ordinary thickness, the lock had been
made for a doll’s house. After the cutting
and fixing the three screws which held the
affair were put in position and tightened up.
All seemed well till the key was put in the
keyhole. It had worked well enough before
the lock was put on the door, but now it
refused to turn. An hour’s experimenting
and investigating proved that the cause was
the middle screw. While this was in the
key could not be turned; when it was re-
moved the bolt shot into place. I wondered
why it had been necessary to bring that jim-
crack arrangement all the way from Sweden.
Surely it is possible to make a lock that
will turn witli all its screws in place here in
Australia. The price at which the article
was sold should enable a skilled tradesman to
turn out the article in his own workshop in
better shape and make a living at the game
But there is no guessing what the manufac-
turer in Sweden got for it. Possibly it was
one of those lines carrying a 200 per cent
profit which make sales, of Australian a- o ods
so difficult.

CRAIG &AITKEN,
654 George Street, Sydney.
Gone aloft, at 87, Peter McLean, formerly
a member of the Queensland Leg. Assembly
and one-time Cabinet Minister. lie did great
work for the man on the land, his last ser-
vice being as adviser to the State s Agricul-
tural Bank.
“Tarago” : .Tack Holmes, who died at Bun-
yip (Vic.) recently, was one of the oldest
Diggers in the A.I.F. He enlisted in 1915
at the age of 68, and spent his 69th and 70tli
birthdays in Egypt. Septic poisoning did
what Abdul couldn’t manage.
N. S. Wales lost one of its oldest wool-
classers, and one who was bred to the busi-
ness, when John Morrison died at more than
80 in a Sydney suburb. Nearly a century
ago his father reached the colony under con-
tract to the Government as a wool expert,
and the son followed the paternal path and
studied the jumbuck all over the State.
George W. Elliott, who lately died at
Perth, aged 80, was one of the hard-heads
who helped to lay the foundation of the
wealth that makes Dunedin (M.L.) the
solid financial place it is to-day. He was
manager of the N.Z. Insurance Co., helped
along the woollen industry, and was a useful
citizen in general. He left for Melbourne in
the ’eighties, and drifted to Perth later.
Although he is a sick man, Nicholson,
Chief of Vic. Police, is clinging to his job.
He has been granted two months’ leave, but
could as easily have obtained four months.
The term of three years for which lie was
appointed expires in April, and there is not
much hope of an extension. Perhaps by
February he will decide to go out in April
and take the fat pension to which he is en-
titled. Warren, a senior superintendent, is
getting his hand in while Nicholson is away.
“Hasen”: Driving through a crowded
street in Chinese Hongkong, I was staring
vaguely at the hundreds of signs that
sprawled over the shops and buildings. A
sweating coolie jogged between the shafts of
the ’rickshaw, but he seemed not quite so
anxious to please as his tribe once had been.
Hundreds of others parted to right and left
of us, but somehow they gave me the idea
of not being in such a hurry to get out of
the road as they used to be. And then high
among the decorative nightmares of figurings
and hieroglyphics I saw owe. sign in outsize
characters that perhaps explained it all. “The
Federated Union of Chinese Labor,” it read.
If you lived in Paddington (Sydney) 80
years'ago and the hairspring of your gun-
metal watch went on strike, or you wanted
to present your “donah" with a brooch,
Charlie Oakes, now N.S.W. Chief Sec., was
the man to visit. Oakes, who was 68 a few
days ago, was one of the best speakers iu the
old Ocean-street Debating Club, and his
friendliness to reporters nowadays earns him
silent cheers from the press gallery. Pos-
sessing most of the Ministry’s supply of tact,
he usually lias the job of spinning the tale
that will get his party out of a nasty corner.
When Fuller was in England he showed his
strength and gameness in smashing the num-
erous “caves” that were formed within the
National party for the purpose of reshuffling
the Ministry’s personnel. Oil' duty he is
addicted to early Australian history and
numismatics.
The little hamlet of St. Helena, near
Heidelberg (Vic.), was founded in 1839 on
a thousand acres of land granted to Anthony
Beale, an English military officer, who had
been with the Emperor on his prison-island.
Some willows are still growing there which
he is reputed to have brought from
Napoleon’s tomb. The small bluestone
church which he built on the estate contains
some interesting memorials. One tablet is
in memory of Onesephesoris James Beale,
son of the old soldier, drowned in the Speck
in 1839; another commemorates the death of
three Beales, great-grandsons of the builder
of the church, who died in the World War.
A stained-glass window is in memory of Mar-
garet Lindsay Beale, born at St. Helena in
1827, who died in 1914. Yet another window
is the tribute to the A.I.F. men from the
district.
“Kyver”: If the Commonwealth is to de-
rive any real benefit from the new Baldwin
Government’s proposal to impose a tariff in
Australia’s favor on dried and canned fruits,
some wines and honey, it will need a far
higher preference than is outlined to enable
us to seriously compete with the cheap-labor
countries thousands of miles nearer to the
United Kingdom. Take currants, on which
it is proposed to impose a tariff of 2s. per
ewt. in our favor. In the past Australia
has furnished but a small percentage of
Britain’s requirements, Greece has supplied
the bulk. The workers in the Greek currant
industry are paid, men 6 drachma (55.)
and women 2 drachma (Is. Bd.) for a day’s
work of not less than 10 hours. Australian
workers, both male and female, are paid not
less than 13s. 6d. a day of 8 hours. What
difference is a tariff of one-fifth of a penny
per lb. going to make, in view of this and
our remoteness from the market?
Of the 13 who have gone to a fIOOO-a-
-year job in the Senate under Clause 15 of
the Constitution, N. S. Wales has contri-
buted four. The first from the Ma State
was Dr. Mackellar, who in 1903 replaced
R. E. O’Connor. When Pratten dropped
out in 1921 Garling filled his place. Massy
Greene stepped into Milieu’s shoes, and J.
M. Power makes the fourth. Two have
come from Victoria, J. F. Hannan, vice S.
Barker, and Itobt. Reid, who followed Fred-
erick Sargood. The two Croweaters were
Shannon and J. V. O’Loghlin. O’Loghlin
was elected by the joint Houses in June,
1907, in place of Vardon, whose election in.
1906 had been declared void through the
bungling of an official. Six months later
the High Court pushed O’Loghlin out, in-
asmuch as the vacancy ivasn’t casual, and
O’Loghlin couldn’t be a substitute Senator
because there hadn’t been any Senator to
be substitute for. Ln the subsequent elec-
tion Vardon easily beat O’Loghlin. The
Speck's trio are J, Earle, ex-lerAler of
Tassy Labor party (he was appointed in
I. by a Nationalist Parliament and was
returned to the Senate by the people at the
election in the same year), Mufcahy and
J. B. Hayes. J. Y. MacDonald, who landed
.T. Adamson’s job in 1922, is the only Quecns-
•lander, but lie didn’t last long, being beaten
a few months later at the polls. Westralia’s
lone rep. was 11. J. Saunders, who filled the
vacancy left by N. Iv. (now Justice) Ewing
in 1903.

HE crowning achievement in Player-Pianos is unquestionably the
magnificent "Mae5tr0.”.......
This latest Beale Model realises the exalted purpose of the makers to
build a Player-Piano superior to anything hitherto heard or seen
Its reception as a musical instrument by a wide circle of
eminent musicians was unanimously enthusiastic. The
later judgment of a music-loving public is a complete endorse-
ment of the verdict of those higher critics.
The"Maestro”Model is bound to become the choice of
those of discerning taste who know the qualities that should
be embodied in a perfect player.
The richness and purity of its brilliant tone establishes the
"Maestro”as a classic instrument. Time is the test of quality
and the passing years will but emphasise the tonal supremacy
of this Player.
Critical inspection and examination of the materials incor-
porated in the“Maestro”Model is suggested. The construc-
tion throughout has been reserved for master-craftsmen in the
Beale factories. Both musical and artistic features are a
unique combination of efficiency and beauty.
The "Maestro” Player-Piano makes possible a perfect rendi-
tion. No matter how great a demand the composer may
make upon the subtleties of expression, the amazingly flex-
ible controls of the"Maestro”Piayer permit of a wholly artistic
interpretation—perfect in its fidelity.
"Maestro”—a musical term signifying "Master”—belongs
to this Piano by every right and title.
The"Maestro”Model may be inspected at Beale & Co’s
Showrooms, 340 George Street, Sydney. Liberal allowance
will be made on pianos accepted in partial exchange; con-
venient terms arranged.
o c-luxe Folder showing actual photographic reproductions of the" Maestro
will be posted free to any address.

The New Triangular Slick.
Makes Shaving a Pleasure!
In half a minute Rexona Shaving Soap softens the beard,
and the lather will remain on the face with all its softness for
twelve minutes. But Rexona shavers do not require this, for
Rexona Shaving Soap makes the beard so soft that a Rexona
shave really takes not more than two minutes.
A Rexona shave is a luxuriant yet an economical shave, for
the lather is over 1 50 times as great as the Soap used, and a 1 /6
triangular stick is sufficient to last the average man at least 1 5 0
shaves, which makes over eight shaves for a penny. Then, too,
consider how much easier Rexona Shaving Soap makes the beard
on the razor, and how soft, smooth and antiseptic it leaves the
skin, and protects it from all weather conditions. Being an
antiseptic Medicated Soap, it has a
tendency to quickly heal any cut
you may have the misfortune to get,
and if troubled with pimples and
blotches of any kind, will daily tend
to remove them.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Youth.
HE was a soldier with a soldier’s eyes,
Quick for the battle, mirrored in
his gun.
One who believed that all Life’s cherished
' prize
Was the gilt medals that his valor won.
He loved a country, but abhorred the ties
And pricks of man-made laws. His tale
is done....
Somewhere he sleeps beneath far foreign
skies,
And the red earth he trod shuts out
the sun.
Innocence.
How beauty stirs the envy of the gods!
The lilies hid their cheeks when she was
near,
And there were dewy eyes on fallow clods
To hold her lissom form in mirrors clear.
Her heart was like the wattle’s head that
nods
To lend the sun its gold when he grows
sere.
Oh.. guard your footsteps by these heav-
ing sods.
Where she is sleeping in her crystal bier.
Lust.
Virtue was scarcely known till this one came
To contrast all the features of her face,
Build her a pedestal upon his shame,
And on liis tattered rags display her lace.
Hot passions burnt their brands upon his
frame,
Shrivelled his soul beneath its deep dis-
grace,
Till Sodom turned to rear its-trodden name.
And Cain found comfort in his higher
place.
Strife.
Over the tossing mantle of the deep
A grey ship hastens on a ceaseless quest;
And he who watches where sea-dawns
creep
Roves on and on, and, roving, glimpses
rest.
The salted winds; the mighty waves that
leap;
The eddy’s whirl; the swelling mountain’s
crest—
Each a new harvest for his hands to reap,
A comfort for the wild thing in his breast.
Content.
His life is like his own fair garden plot,
A thing of ordered paths and sheltered
ways:
High-walled that storms may pass and touch
it not;
Roofed over to withhold the sun’s fierce
rays.
The crop that his own tillage has begot
Holds near his parent hand nor ever strays.
All seasons come and go and are forgot,
And pulseless pleasures fill the empty days.
How soft the fabric of this tent of dream,
Where Time has woven his philosophy!
How low the murmur of the gentle stream
That flows to meet, unstirred, its wait-
ing sea!
He stoops his head to hear the songs that teem
From Youth’s fresh lips, and weaves their
melody
Through simple words that give a sunset
gleam
To all the changing scenes of memory.
VICTORIA.
Cecil Mann.
The Eternal Grind.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
JOHN GARTON was one of life’s mis-
fits. His was an imaginative soul
that a perverse fate liad confined
within cramped limits —a dreamer who hated
figures, and yet had known little else since
his schooldays. His career had been marked
by spasmodic efforts to escape. The first of
these was made in Maoriland, after he had put
in two rebellious years over a manufacturer’s
ledgers. He was young then and careless of
consequences, and his attempt was partially
successful. His objective had been America,
simply because it was on the other side of
the world, but his purse had not been equal
to this, and he had arrived in Sydney with
a pound or two in his pocket and a liberal
supply of enthusiasm.
It appeared, however, that work was un-
pleasantly . necessary for a while to enable
him to live while he explored the wonders of
this new region, and he landed a job a week
after his arrival. It was just a job; and
once again he was involved in interminable
mazes of figures. But his desk was near
the window of a little works office of a large
dockyard, and he could glimpse occasionally
the blue of the sea. It kept him up, re-
minded him that his bondage was only tem-
porary, and helped him along generally.
There was another little matter, also,
which brought real dreams to his drab lodg-
ings in a drab suburb and hope to the stuffy
office. This was a distant legacy that was
to come to him when he reached man’s
estate. It was a matter of three hundred
pounds—no fortune, certainly, but an open
sesame to foreign lands and the delights of
travel. He had it all planned out. He
would start with Canada and work his way
down the continent, always with a nest-egg
in reserve. Afterwards he would see Lon-
don and the East. In the meantime he could
afford to wait, for the day was not far dis-
tant when he could bid farewell to figures
and seek the activity of the open spaces.
The life of a rolling-stone appealed to him.
He was not unaware of the old adage, but at
this period of his life moss seemed of little
importance.
. The weeks and months slipped away in
incessant and hateful toil, until only a mat-
ter of six moons separated him from his
twenty-first birthday. At this fateful period
the girl entered.. She appeared in a board-
ing-house to which Garton moved, and they
drifted together through sheer loneliness,
r n Was ta] l a,ld slim , grey of eye and dark
ot hair—typically Australian and very com-
panionable. It appeared that their interests
vere identical and the discovery was slowly
niaae o n moonlit nights within sound of the
sea. The affair ripened into intimacy; and
one night Garton frightened himself by ask-
ing lier to marry him. Margot, who after
a disappointing day was particularly sick
of working for a living, accepted him.
It was all very easily done, although after-
wards Garton found himself wmndering
vaguely what he had done. But it was too
late to draw back now, so he made the best
of it by finding out what a wonderful girl
she really was and how extremely happy they
would certainly be. They had no one’s per-
mission to obtain; and they were married
on his twenty-first birthday. The knot was
tied irrevocably in a dingy little registrar’s
oflice and John sallied out into the morning
sunshine with a wife leaning on his arm.
The first months were wonderfully happy.
At first they made love in a tiny flat, but
later, with the coming of the fateful legacy,
they moved out to a seaside suburb and
invested in furniture. Their home was the
scene of much happiness; and John felt that
the delightful evenings at home and the all-
too-sliort week-ends made up a great deal for
the monotony of his work. He was still en-
meshed in those interminable mazes of
figures.
A year passed away and Garton began to
dream again. The first glamor faded into
married complacency. They hit it off very
well together and the dovecot was disturbed
by comparatively few quarrels; but America
lay a few more thousand miles away and the
East had receded into the distance. He con-
soled himself by admitting Margot into his
dreams and planning an extended tour when
he had made some money.
And then there arose at the oflice a situation
which involved Garton and left him with his
resignation in his hand. He quitted his work
with an unholy joy in his soul, sold his fur-
niture, with his heart steeled against the pro-
testing tears of Margot; and they migrated
to the country and invaded the fastnesses
of the bush. A small farm was leased for
a ridiculously small rental; and Garton ex-
panded his chest and guided a broken plough
with the conviction that he had burst his
fetters at last.
lie ploughed and persistent rains left his
paddock soaking for weeks on end. He
trapped rabbits, and foxes skulked beyond
the creek and robbed his traps. He in-
vested in a hoi'se and dray, and secured a
contract to cart sandstone from a quarry out
through a bush-track. On the third day he
smashed the axle of his dray. He sold his
horse and was never paid for it. Altogether
his dreams were disturbed by unexpected
shadows, and their roseate hue changed to
the color of nightmare.
Margot, too, had been taken ill. A winter
in the bush with insufficient bedding, home-
made utensils and a diet mostly of rabbits
and mushrooms played havoc with a consti-
tution none too strong. She was forced to
return to Sydney and work the treadle of her
sewing-machine to keep things going. Gar-
ton gave it up at last, and followed her to
Sydney, leaving the bush with a genuine
sigh and the regret that hangs around dis-
illusionment.
There now came the problem of work. He
was willing to work, he knew that he would
have to work, but there seemed to be a sur-
plus of willing workers. He struggled
through a dreary month of unemployment,
and was finally pushed into a job—in a
timber-yard. He had worked mostly with
figures, though he had tackled hard labor
in the bush, but this work was harder. He
toiled grimly through long days that left in
his mind blurred impressions of sweat and
splinters, of heart-wrenching lifts, of tre-
mendous lengths of hardwood and swaying
slings that threatened to push him from pre-
carious footholds into eternity or to crash
down upon him and extinguish his stubborn
spark forever.
At the end of the week he was stiff, sore
and hopeless; at the end of a month he was
not sore, but dogged: at the end of three
months he was a mechanical device for the
lumping of timber. But even machines may
have their dreams and Garton cherished his.
His mind was one protest against the dam-
nable slavery of it; his heart yearned for the
plans of youth. He wanted to drift, to wan-
der, to seek the lonely places of the world,
to dodge forever the relentless fate that kept
him down to the eternal grind.
His dreams followed him to work and
stayed with him through the sweating hours.
They returned home with him to the bed-
sitting room he rented; they sat with him
after tea while he smoked his pipe on the
verandah and listened to his wife’s account
of the doings of the day. And all the while
the old spirit of rebellion stirred within him,
whispered of old chances lost and urged him
to flight. He was young, his wife was
young; and when all was said and done, he
was a mere drag upon her. She was attrac-
tive and clever and could do better without
a hopeless husband. The only trouble was
her affectionate nature. All through the try-
ing times she had clung to her marriage
ideals, had tended the wavering flame of con-
jugal felicity and kept alive unwearyingly the
sacred thing she worshipped. She refused
to recognise his worthlessness, ignored his
faults and clung to him with a love that had
grown with the passage of time.
But Garton was a dreamer and there came
a time when his dreams obsessed him. He
felt that fate had not intended him for these
interminable grooves. He felt that better
things awaited a bold spirit, capable of aris-
ing and shaking off the old bonds; and one
morning he arose with the conviction that
he had reached the end and resolved to break
with his present life forever.
He listened to his wife over the break-
fast table in gloomy silence; and when she
kissed him good-bye he thrust the pangs of
remorse heartlessly aside. With the per-
versity of fate she seemed doubly affection-
ate that particular morning, clinging to him
at the door and letting him go reluctantly,
wistfully.
“I left a little note in your lunch, Jack,”
she said softly.
He groaned in spirit as he walked down
the street. This was a favorite trick of
Margot’s—a little note with a few soft words
of love to cheer him through the lunch hour.
He caught the same old tram and landed
at the railway as usual. But he did not
wait for another tram bound for Pyrmont,
as he generally did. Instead, he turned
into the station and paused before the great
time-table. He had ten pounds with him;
the rest of his money he had left at home for

Avert the Deadly Blood-poison
Peril!
You can’t afford to laugh at Simple Injuries.
Never assume indifference to ordinary cuts, burns and abrasions!
Never be so unwise as to think such injuries of little account and allow
them to go neglected for days! That’s how limbs and even lives are
sacrificed to this blood-poison peril.
In time of accident you need help quickly,
and Zam-Buk is always the safest and most
reliable antiseptic first-aid to have handy.
Whether it be a cut finger or a gashed knee,
scratched arm, burnt hand, sprain, insect
bite, bruise or open wound, Zam-Buk can
always be depended upon to swiftly banish
pain and soreness, and ensure the utmost
safety with clean, perfect healing.
Zam-Buk’s valuable antiseptic properties
not only guard exposed tissues against infec-
tion, but quickly remove any trace of poison
already there. Thus inflammation and ulcer-
ation are completely averted.
RESCUED FROM BLOOD-POISON.
“My right hand was crushed by a log, and the
little finger split open to the bone,” says Mr. Simpson,
of Annerly Road, South Brisbane. “In spite of hot
fomentations the finger went blue-black and swelled
to twice normal size. At night the throbbing pain pre-
vented sleep, and as the poison spread into the arm,
painful hard lumps began to form.
“Disabled for a fortnight the injury cost me £lO
in wages. How much longer I would have been off
work I can’t say, as fortunately I was persuaded to
try Zam-Buk. It did me a world of good. Zam-Buk
drew out all inflammation and corruption from the
wound and so perfectly healed the finger that there
wasn’t scarce a mark to be seen.”

the use of his wife. He felt that he had
acted fairly, and decided to board a train
bound for the country.
The step was soon taken ; and he sat back
in his second-class seat feeling that it did
not seem so very terrible after all to be
plunging thus desperately down the wrong
grade. The morning was long, for they
stopped at most stations; and the whole
journey seemed to be a mere succession of
bumps and jolts. At midday they stopped
at a larger station for a hasty meal, and then
Carton remembered that he still had the
lunch his wife; had prepared for him.
“Poor little Margot!”
The words came from him involuntarily as
lie broke the string and opened out the paper.
Me pictured the deft fingers that had cut his
sandwiches and folded the serviette so care-
fully ; and for the first time he felt that he
was struggling against irresistible forces.
The ties of a happy marriage cannot be so
easily torn away. A square of white paper
sat up on top of the sandwiches, and for a
moment his weakening spirit urged him to
throw it away.
But something else brought his fingers to
unfold it slowly, and he looked down on
the familiar —and dearly-loved—handwrit-
ing. He read mechanically at first, and then
the significance of the words soaked into his
mind.
“Dearest,” wrote Margot, “I have told
you so many wonderful things in these little
notes that I f?el I must tell you the most
wonderful of all in the same way. I nearly
told you last night, but somehow I just
didn’t. Jack, dear, we are going to have a
lovely little baby. Isn’t it wonderful? I
do hope it will be a girl. Love.”
He folded the note very carefully and left
liis lunch, untasted, on the seat.
An hour later he boarded a train to Syd-
ney, hurried from the station to the timber-
yard, arriving there about knock-off time,
and saw the foreman. He made plausible
explanations, and was told to start again the
next morning. After that he made for home
and Margot, his mind submissive before a
realisation of the inevitable, and his heart
lighter beneath the knowledge of a purpose
in life.
He paused to buy some flowers for Margot.
“After all.” he told himself, “I suppose
it’s just Life.”

The House with the Yellow Gate.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SEVEN tall, dead tree-trunks, black as
prison bars, on the edge of the cliff,
and the sun peering through at me
with the red eye of hate.
Slow and sinister, now here, now there,
now near, then far, the ghost-bell of Souls
in Torment clangs its count of doom. Swift
through the dusk above the valley cleaves the
silent pinion of the bat-winged shadow,
slipped from the caravan of night, to watch
me writhe in fear of that which has been
appointed unto me to do, and which I,
though fearing, swear to do. Trembling, I
turn and follow the seven shadows to the
yellow gate. Behind dank, dripping trees,
black-green beneath their covered gloom,
stands the House.
All houses have souls- —the mansion on the
hill, the rose-covered cottage, the granite-
grey court and bank, the old stone church
with the cypress-trees, the slinking tenement
by the river’s ooze. But the soul of this
house is the soul of Hate.
The gate creaks, sibilant, foreboding. .1
walk through the foetid maze, where moulder-
ing statue-faces gibber, and pallid hands
beckon me on. Broken and moss-grown are
the steps of the portico. One door only
breaks the mildewed-grey visage fronting me
and the trees. But high up, in the centre, a
deep barred window, as an eye, looks down-
ward, watchful, eager, malign. Weaving its
subtle sense upon me comes an odor from
the pile—furtive ester of an evil thing, mes-
sage of peril and dread, distinct yet elusive,
half-recalling that which hates to be re-
called.
What is it? Through the by-ways and
alleys of my mind, through musty rooms and
passages cumbered with the debris of the
years, I chase the elusive thought, grasping
to lose again—snatching at Memory. And
then, lo I I understand. The Museum!
House of the Dead, with its desecrated mum-
mies and its smell of tombs! Waves of fear
ripple my body as the sand. But I must
go on! Peril sheer as death affrights me;
fear congeals my blood and brain. But I
must go on !
A finger on a button; the door splits open
and slides away without a sound. Before
me a long, dark passage, and in a door a
green lens, shining as an eye. Three taps,
three steps, and I stand in a green-lit cham-
ber, curtains on the further wall, and chairs
and green-baized tables strewn with cruel
instruments in steel. In the centre, on an
ebony stand, a Venetian glass bowl filled with
red wine, like a ruby set in the heart of a
crystal. A bell tinkles. The black drapings
of the opposite wall draw aside. Bowing and
spreading white hands below a face that
leers at me, a white-robed figure glides
silently, and beside the bowl-topped stand
bows deep again. Pale, trepidant, moving
as if both driven and led, I go on.
A white hand points to the red fluid in the
bowl, and motions me to drink. No! I will
not! I strain—and then, trembling, I stoop
over the vessel and put my lips to the ruby
pool.
A smell of soot. An odor of sepulchral
things. A swelling buoyancy stirs me—a
clarity of vision that sees all, knows all, the
end and the beginning; and Fear is palsied
with the sense of Fate. Two old men, grey-
bearded to the knees, crouch over a table,
throwing dice. No pause, no movement but
that of claw-like hands weaving to and fro,
no sound but the click of cubes. I know they
have been there since their youth. I know
what this chamber is for, and why these
strange instruments and chairs. I know
that they play for the bodies and the souls
of men.
The white-robed figure speaks: “Civilisa-
tion, my friend, means refinement —refine-
ment in all things. Yet side by side with
refinement in Art and Science, in Music and
Research, we cling to the veriest crudity in
our social methods. Our treatment of the
criminal is the worst. We prison him with
an apology for our own ineptitude; we admit
our futility in making his punishment a past-
time, our hapliazardry in the make-believe
that confinement plus comfort spells reform
for the enemy of society. I am about to
alter all that. I have perfected the science
of the age. Criminal instinct is merely atro-
phied sensibility. I remove the atrophy.
With exquisite delicacy, my friend, I make
the criminal know and acknowledge Fear —
fear that makes virtue the better policy. In
short, I punish his nerves!”
Lovingly he handles his instruments.
Smoothly he motions me into a chair, which
grips me close. Zeal lights up his face.
“Success,” he says, “depends on expert know-
ledge of the human nerves. My knowledge
is omniscience applied to art. I am a bene-
factor of mankind —the greatest inventor
of the time. Posterity will enshrine me, for
I kill all crime. Prison and punishment,
with my system given to the world, will be-
come a horror to the evildoer—a thing of
the past. For my system is High Art —fine
art applied to criminal nerves.”
From a pocket he takes a little metal disc
with a spike in the centre, like a drawing-pin.
“See! This is for capital cases, I press
it into the spinal column; the subject per-
forms the most exquisite convulsions, and
then —poof!”
A white hand presses the chair. My head
goes down ; my feet go up.
“My friend, I give you a practical demon-
stration. Just this little disc, a little squeeze,
and—but no ! You are not a capital case,
not yet.” The white hand hovers. The disc
goes back to the pocket. “I will first engage
the nerves of your mouth, then of the eye,
the nose, the ear. That will be enough for
the day. Ecstasy will be yours, my friend—
an exquisite octave in the neuralgic scale.
Beside it, all that you know, all that you
have dreamt of in the paean of pain, will
seem a lullaby. Do not struggle—be calm!
Delicacy of touch helps me to reach the acme
of my art. Open your mouth !”
One hand presses back my head. The
other, gripped round a grim steel probe, is
before ray face. A prick, a pang, then a
lightning stroke of agony through my mouth
and brain. One frenzied kick, and I know
no more.
* * * #
My eyes open to a surge of fear. I shriek;
I slaver at the mouth. But what is this?
A white-robed figure convulsed upon the
floor ! Ha ! The demonstration ! That vest-
pocket and the disc! Ha, ha ! Oh, lucky
kick of mine! I gloat with joy! See him
there, in the death-sweat of agony, the apo-
theosis of his art! Like the little cuirassed
beetle that, falling on its back, flicks itself
into the air, so noAV this Benefactor of Man-
kind ! Ho, ho! I gloat again! See him
now, stiffening to rigidity! The jaws ser,
the eyes protrude, the mouth is a very twist
of pain. Tremors seize him, swell to a
convulsive wave, and die. A moment, and
then, in a burst of agony, the body snaps
backward, springs bowstring-taut, into the
air. and falls rod-stiff upon the floor!
Ha, ha ! A “capital case” ! Ho, ho ! I
laugh and laugh!
But see! Those old men ! They come
for me! Fury in their eyes, beards stream-
ing in their rush, they come for me, my body,
my soul! I fly ! Out through the door and
passage, through the trees and gibbering
statues, through the yellow gate. Now a
hundred, now a thousand grey-bearded men
pursue me, eyes gleaming, long whiskers hiss-
ing in the wind. At their head the butcher,
knife in hand, steel flogging hip, and apron,
cross-barred as a symbol of his guild that
comes from Cain, wreathing his fat stomach
as it heaves in his haste.
The sun has set, but a gibbous moon is
aloft, and the houses along the way show in
melting outlines against the glow. Flutter-
ing breezes tell of other worlds afar; the
night is pleasant -with the melody of far-off:
sounds. But behind me comes the hiss of
hot breaths, the hurrying surge of slippered
feet. I reach the haven of a door, a passage.
Now- the odor is of the restaurant, the aroma
of baked meats. At the turn a shutter opens,
and hairy hands stretch forth with a dish
bearing a great sirloin that drips red blood.
I take it, for I know its destiny.
Along the polished floor I move, as a
skater upon the ice. Faster, faster, I glide
with blissful ease. Fear is left behind.
Faster yet, mile upon mile, between the
green-lit walls. Away in the distance an
open fireplace, and a black cat sitting above
dead coals. Faster yet! I try to stop, but
speed is my master. Nearer and nearer,
faster and faster —crash! I sprawl between
the hobs. The dish is shattered, the meat
makes a red splash upon the wall. Spitting
fury, the cat swirls up the chimney, and a
cloud of soot comes down.
Ashes in my mouth and eyes, I rise and
look round. Before me is a door, and above
it written: “Ye Ancient and Noble Order
of Original Vegetarians. We eat to live.”
I place the mired meat upon a fragment of
the dish, and knock at the door. It opens.
Inside I see "a hundred guests, cadaverous,
open-mouthed, wolfishly-expectant. I give
the password and step forward; the dishes
clatter, and the gaunt forms spring to their
feet in one glad chorus: “The meat! The
meat!”
The waiter runs to me, his hands out-
stretched. I make my offering, and his eyes
bulge with horror. He stiffens, gabbles word-
lessly, then flings up his arms to a burst of
malediction. A moment more and the guests
jump from their seats arid rush at me, their
joy turned to the red fury of vegetarians
scorned. I turn to run, but cannot move:
leaden weights hold my feet to the floor. I
shriek; a hundred hands flash into the air.
a hundred knives flash downward.
* * * *
My eyes open in a smother of dread. Again
that sooty odor, and in my mouth a strange
taste and pain. Slanting through a cur-
tained window a sunlit ray strikes the
nickellcd arm of my chair. Tinkle, tinkle,
says a tiny jet of water falling into a glass
bow T l near my hand. White-cuffed and white-
gowned, an angel at my side holds a rubber
mask with a tube trailing from it, and smiles
at me, as if amused. Before me is a white-
robed figure, and in his hand a pair of for-
ceps, gripping the fang of wisdom, blood
dripping from its prongs. He grins and
waves fang and forceps towards the waterjet
and bowl.
“Spit!” he says.
