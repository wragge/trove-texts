“THE BULLETIN.”
(Published at Sydney, N.S.W.)
The Inline Weekly-Australia's Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
“The Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dis-
tinctive Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
One Person, one Vote.
Complete Secularisation and Freedom of State
Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
Australia for the Australians. —The cheap
Chinaman, the cheap nigger, and the
cheap European pauper to be absolutely
excluded.
A State Bank, the issue of bank;-notes to be a
State monopoly.
The direct election of Ministers by Parlia-
ment, instead of Party Government or
rather Government by Contradiction.
A new Parliamentary System—one House to
be elected by constituencies as at present;
the other to be chosen by the whole
country voting as one Constituency.
A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance,
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-
ship of Land.
The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “nobility. ’
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter that is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started 13 years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become the representative Australian
journal, because it possesses a vitality lacked
by the countless newspaper-ventures in which
Australian capitalists have unavailingly spent
large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued ,by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after th
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress: it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct pause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
I my human authority which has not been granted
iy the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
ournal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
iransferred from the columns of a daily paper
ssued from the same office. The Bulletin is
lot connected with any other paper, mid the
natter it contains is all specially prepared by its
iwn unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
bv runners in the streets of every Australasian
lanital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheiler of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maonland
Ranees A paper which is at once the most
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postai offieial- toat,
of all journals issued in Australasia, Ihe Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

In Paris, when a prisoner violently resists
arrest the police get him down and confiscate his
boots, and cut all the buttons off his clothes.
After that he goes quietly. A man whose hands
are both occupied holding on his clothes can’t resist
arrest.
When King William of Prussia — after-
wards first German Emperor—narrowly escaped
death at the hands of Oscar Becker in 1861, the
would-be assassin “was tried on the count for
attempted murder, and, as no life was taken, he
was sentenced to imprisonment with hard labour
for a term of 20 years ” (Lord Augustus Loftus,
Diplomatic Reminiscences.) If the King had
been fortunate enough to be a N.S. W. policeman
under Dibbs, Oscar would have been promptly
hanged. But William being merely a king in a
barbarous, not-right-thinking country, the man
who avowedly tried to kill him was only im-
prisoned.
Dear Bulletin, —There is a man down
here who is commonly known as “ the Hard
Case.” There are many hard cases hereabouts,
but this person is generally recognised as the
hardest. The other day a party of us were out
riding, and just as|we passed a pork and bacon
factory one of the horses shied and landed the
Hard Case senseless on his head on the roadway.
After a serious consultation we resolved that he
was dead, and proceeded to carry his remains
through the factory to the manager’s house at the
back. The motion brought the corpse back to
life, and he looked round and recognised the
place. Then he kicked violently and sat up la
our arms with a shriek: “No, no, NO ! ” he
yelled ; “Oh, my God, no, Bill ! Not sausages!
Bury me.” And with that he sank back again
insensible. —Yours, &c., H.H.8., Sale, Vic.
Dear Bulletin, —“Steele Grey’s ” letter
on the fang formation of Australian snakes is only
another conspicuous and pitiful display of cock-
sure ignorance. As a poet “ Steele Grey ” is,
perhaps, a partial success; as a scientific naturalist
he is a distinct and ludicrous failure. Science is
truth ; poetry is mere imagery. The scientist has
to reason, the poet has only to rhyme. When I
wrote “subsidiary fangs”no one but a hot-headed
sentimental poet would imagine that I meant
teeth. The subsidiary fangs of Australian snakes
don’t come into functional activity—that is they
don’t convey poison into the punctures they make
—until sometime after the first or true fangs have
been broken or removed. Underwood, who
bragged that he had a cure for snakebite, lost his
life through Steele-Grey-like ignorance of the fact
that drawing the first pair of fangs of an Aus-
tralian snake will not render it innocuous. The
black snake (Pseudechis porphyrircus ), for example,
has four subsidiary fangs, so that if two sets of
fangs were drawn there would still be a third
and last pair to come into functional activity
which would be i just as deadly and
dangerous as the first or second pair had been.
I solemnly warn Bulletin readers not to accept
the ipse dixit of the poet “Steele Grey,” in
matters of this kind, but to write (say) to the
Curator of the Australian Museum, Sydney, and
they will find that once more I am right. As
regards “Steele Grey’s ” statement that the so-
called “sting ” of Acanthophis antarctica is not the
last joint of the spine, nothing more need be said.
Eight years ago this very question was decided by
the Australian Museum authorities in my favour.

With an ordinary tape measure determine the width
round the Joints AA, round the instep 88, round heel OC,
round the ankle DD ; next ascertain the length and widtn
of tread by placing the foot on a sheet of paper, and
running a lead pencil round the heel and toes. Cut the
outline thus made with a scissors, and enclose with the
other measurements, stating what size you generally take,
what are your peculiarities—a weak ankle, perhaps a pet
corn, ingrowing nails, or a blooming bunion. All these
little matters attended to, if you have a long ,® r

Vok Populi.
Many years ago someone said that “the
voice of the people is the voice of God,”
which vigorous and eloquent-sounding aphor-
ism has done duty even to this day. Yet no
one, in any English-speaking community at
all events, knows what the voice of the
people really is, for it has never had an
opportunity to make itself heard in any
definite or understandable sense. Constitu-
tional Government —which really means
Party Government —only differs from auto-
cracy in degree ; in principle it hardly differs
at all. The one acknowledges that govern-
ment should be the reflex of the popular will,
while the other does not, but the effect of
both systems is to make it as little the
reflex of the will of the governed and
as much a matter of the personal and
private interests of the governors as
possible. In neither case can the people
exercise any direct control over the pro-
cess of law-making ; they can say neither
yea or uay ; they can vote no good measure
and veto no bad one. Under an autocracy
they exact concessions chiefly by threatening
the life of the one law-maker ; under a con-
stitutional system they exact concessions by
threatening the political existence of the
many law-makers; and. under both systems
the result is miserably indecisive. When
the autocrat who will not gcant concessions
is, after much trouble, successfully shot or
dynamited, he is generally sitvjeeded by
another equally uncompromising ; xhen the
Parliament which does not keep pads with
the popular ideas is dissolved, it is genehffly
succeeded by another equally unsatisfactory.
In most cases, neither law-maker knows
what the will of the people really is. It is
not expressed by newspapers, which only
reflect the opinions of their proprietors ; it
cannot be gathered from public meetings,
for comparatively few people attend public
meetings, and a meeting, at the best, only
expresses the opinions of the crowd which
vociferates on the front benches ; neither
can it be ascertained from petitions, for
most people habitually sign petitions without
reading or understanding them. And, above
all, it cannot be learned from Parliamentary
elections,’ which depend mostly on party
management, on the way the votes happen
to be split, on sectarianism, on the
road-and-bridge interest, on the personal
popularity of candidates with the local
Orange lodge, orthepriests, orthe Oddfellows,
or the Buffaloes, or the footballers ; on the
liquor-vote, and on all manner of other con-
tingencies. The popular will can’t be ascer-
tained by any machinery now existing, and
no one knows definitely, or ever has known,
or is likely to know, what it really is.
• # *
When the approaching New South Wales
election is over the local Legislature will
probably be a little further from any accurate
knowledge of this subject than it ever was
before. It is time to abandon the dismal
pretence, which the daily press maintains so
persistently, of professing that the contest
hinges on any definite question whatever It
doesn’t turn upon Protection or Freetrade,
on Federation, Local Government, the State
Bank or the absentee-tax, on land law
reform, on labour legislation or capitalistic
legislation, on republicanism, democracy,
socialism, sectarianism, or any other definite
issue whatever. The result will be arrived
at partly by a hazy mingling of all these and
many other matters ; partly by local influ-
ences ; partly by a vast number of vague and
extraneous influences. In the constituencies
where the strong party runs six candidates
and a weak party runs only one, the weak
party will win, and this arithmetical con-
sideration will do more to decide the result
than anything else. The election in each
one of the 125 electorates will be run on
different issues ; the politician who can fight
a winning battle at Pyrmont must be fear-
fully and wonderfully unlike the politician of
the same party who comes out on top at the
Barwon. When the results are out, and all the
different politicians are added together in the
attempt to make a coherent whole, the pro-
blem will be much the same as that of adding
£6 2s. 6d. to 4 gals. 2qts. and multiplying
the result by a mile and a half or a mile and
three-quarters. Each one will nominally
represent a one-hundred-and-twenty-fifth
part of the alleged will of the people. But
each man will really and truly only know
that he has got in, and which one, or which
47, of his principles or his promises sent
him in, or whether he was sent in because of
any of them, or whether he arrived purely
through the disorganisation of his opponents
and all his principles are loathed and exe-
crated by the great majority of the com-
munity, he will be utterly unable to tell,
Also, the community, which has no definite
means of ascertaining its own mind as a
whole, won’t know either. Even with the
best of intentions to govern according to the
popular will, Parliament is blocked per-
petually by the fact that neither it nor any-
body else knows what that will amounts to.
* # #
The Second Ballot, to which The Bulle-
tin, in common with many others, was once
inclined to pin a considerable amount of
faith, is obviously too feeble an expedient
to suit the case. All it can do is to
provide that, when no one candidate receives
an absolute majority of the votes polled, the
two or three leading men shall be ballotted
for anew, and this only touches the outer
fringe of the difficulty. When ten or twelve
or fifteen candidates are scrambling for a
single seat, as is just now the case in various
electorates, and where three distinct parties
are in existence, and one party is more or
less represented by eight or nine candidates
who all insist on going to the poll, it is quite
possible for the man who, on his own indi-
vidual merits, would command the biggest
vote, to be fourth or fifth on the list, and
to be thus entirely out of the second ballot.
In such an irruption the very weak party,
which has one representative only, may
easily come out on top ; the comparatively
feeble party which runs three representa-
tives may hold the ' second, third and
fourth places ; and the best man of
the strong party which is cursed with
eight candidates may only come in fifth.
Under such conditions the second ballot
would come very little nearer to determining
the will of the people than did the first.
Moreover, the second ballot, and any number
of ballots, even up to the fortieth or more,
would leave the principal evil just where it
was before. They would be so many more
repetitions of the old system of voting for
men instead of measures. They would still
leave the nation in the old position of en-
deavouring to give a coherent verdict on
forty different questions by simply saying
“yes” or “no” to one man’s candidature.
The country would have no more control
over the politician who got in on the second
ballot, if he proved false to his promises,
than over the one who got in according to
the old fashion. It would be one move in
the right direction, but no more ; and, in
many respects, it would leave the hap-hazard
machine of Party Government in almost the
same unsatisfactory condition as at present.
# • •
Among all the political parties in Austra-
lia, there is not one that is honest enough
nor intelligent enough to be worth voting
for on its own merits; the least objectionable
one is only worth supporting in order to
keep out those which are more objectionable.
Even the best of them all does not represent
the voice of the country—unless it does so
unconsciously and by accident. It is on all
these troubles and incoherencies of the exist-
ing system that the demand for the Referen-
dum is based. By that device the country is
able to give a tolerably definite decision on
every important question which comes before
it, and can give it on the instant, whereas the
return of twenty new Parliaments on the
present confused and bewildering plan gives
no definite decision about anything. There
have been three general elections in N.S. W.
since Australian Federation first came
to the front, yet no one is any nearer
knowing the views of the majority on
that subject than at the beginning. There
have been at least ten since Local Govern-
ment became an urgent question, and whether
the country at large really wants a system of
Local Government remains as uncertain as
ever. The present system is not only abso-
lutely independent of public opinion ; it even
leaves it a matter of grave uncertainty
whether there is any definite public opinion
at all.

The Bulletin urges the abolition of Party
Government and the introduction of the
Referendum simply because the central prin-
ciple of Democracy is that the country should
be ruled by the will of the majority, and it
knows of no other way whereby this can be
effected. It does not advocate the Re-
ferendum merely because it believes
that its own principles would come up-
permost when the will of the com-
munity received free expression, for no
one knows or can know what would
come uppermost under such circumstances.
There is such an absolute want of data to go
upon that it is as profitable to speculate on
the result as it is to guess at the locality of
the lost sepulchre of Moses. But the
experiment would be the greatest and most
interesting event in Australian history, and
it would decide so many vexed questions,
and abolish such vast quantities of useless poli-
tics, that, in whatever fashion it resulted, it
would be a blessed relief to the community.
And, however it turned out, it would at least
make one thing certain : the country would
thereafter get exactly the kind of Govern-
ment it deserved —no better and no worse.
The Social Bearings of Her Majesty.
When the Duchess of York fulfilled her royal
duty by giving birth to an heir, the Argus was
delivered of another sort of little leading article
which, to Tory eyes, would seem calm and
beautiful. The day for hysteric jubilation at
the advent of a prince has happily passed away
never to return. Unadulterated drivel on such
matters is no longer acceptable even to an
AKGUS-reading crowd, and in its place we get a
specious apology for the Throne, worded with
some respect for the advance of popular educa-
tion. The Tory press does not keep pace with
the times, but, recognising that the times are
getting further ahead than ever, it makes a
pathetic attempt to stagger after them. For-
merly the Crown’s idolaters refused to discuss
the fetish’s infallibility. To admit the existence
of a doubt was to blaspheme. Nowadays they
plead their cause witli the ingenuity of a bar-
rister briefed for the defence, saying everything
passible in extenuation of the sin, and manu-
facturing much of the dirt that they fling at the
other side. Thus the Melbourne organ :
There may be some people in England and among the
great communities over which the English flag waves who
dream of establishing a republic, and who delude them-
selves into the obvious and absurd error that something
might be gained by attacking the monarchy. But what
good could possibly be accomplished? As the constitu-
tion is now administered, the Crown has no right of veto
compared with that which is exercised by the President
of the United States. All the freedom that can be con-
sidered either desirable or necessary for the British people
is already secured, or is within their grasp. They are not
hampered by the corruption of American politics or the
peculiar weakness of the French system of government.
They have in the monarchy an institution that is not
adverse to political progress and that is most powerful in
society ; they have as a Sovereign one who can stoop to no
political intrigue, who can consent to no log-rolling, who
is altogether above the ordinary sordid and selfish and
mean considerations of political partisanship. There is
no earthly reason why the monarch should be deposed in
order to make room for the creature of an election, who
is bound to favour the party that assisted him with its
votes and its money.
Unnecessary to reprint a further three inches of
perennial remarks concerning the “ personal
attachment of English people to the Royal
Family,” and the public interest felt in the
“domestic events” of the Family aforesaid.
Nobody can read newspapers without learning
that a Duke of York marries a wife, and that
the wife has a baby in due course. Public
interest is forced upon the community, and the
maternal instincts of womankind keep it alive.
To the ladies— God bless ’em !—anybody’s
marriage, or the first production of anybody’s
baby, will always be important matters when
they have any kind of acquaintance with the
happy pair. Their acquaintance with this
particular pair is mainly pictorial. If Mrs.
Jones had a baby on the same day as the
Duchess, the “domestic event” of Mrs. J.
interested her friends far more than did the
arrival of the Yorkling. It was a mere
question of knowing Mrs. Jones. As for men
in general, they could be as easily entertained
by a florid description of Jem Corbett’s
nuptials as by the particulars of the grandest
royal wedding on earth. Also, if Mrs. Cor-
bett’s baby were advised, by cable, six months
in advance, and if the cable made much of the
fact that Corbett’s mother-in-law intended to
be there at the time, then the actual coming of
the bruiser’s infant would stir the great heart
of the people to some extent. Anyway, the
alleged personal attachment of English people
to “ royal eventors ” is not much argument for
the Throne. They are attached to plum-pud-
ding, and gin, and heaps of other reprehensible
functions.
The Tory defence of monarchy is careful not
to touch upon that hideous social tumour which
has its roots deep down in the royal system.
True enough that the outward political appear-
ance of the Queen is healthy. She serves a
certain purpose very well, and if she stopped
at that point the elderly lady would not matter
much. Regarded as a perpetual President —
confirming the acts of a Gladstone or a Salis-
bury with equal promptitude in both cases—
the Queen is objectionable only on the score of
expense. It is not, however, the immediate
cost of monarchy, but the results of class dis-
tinction, springing from monarchy, that work
incalculable harm to mankind. Indeed, if the
Queen lived in a White House, and her royalty
didn’t exceed the social pomp of an American
President, and were she not a fount of titular
“honour” and the cause of K.C.M.G.’s, demo-
cracy might be for ever content to keep the
Government figurehead in one fam i ly. Theblessed
Regalia, and the custom of walking backwards
from the Presence, and all the other pernicious
Court mummeries, would disappear, and it
would be absolutely necessary to restrict the
Sovereign to a modest income that there could
be no fear of the reigning family amassing great
wealth—but with these alterations a monarchy
might perhaps exist in the enlightened future.
The name of King or Queen would lose its
tinsel glory, and become merely a plain symbol!
of a straightforward system of Government,,
whilst the children of the hereditary president,,
no longer known as Royal Highnesses, wouldl
possess little charm for the illustrated weeklies,,
and incite no grovel.
# * *
A monarchy that forms the centre of widen-
ing circles of class distinction is a poisonous-
thing. Because the institution is ‘ ‘ most powerful
in society,” society needs reforming altogether.
Royal majesty must be hedged round by heredi-
tary nobility, and “ nobility ” of this kind is the
base end of bloated brewers and selfish capi-
talists in every department of money-making
business. The poor grow poorer that the rich
may become rich enough to get into “the
Prince’s set.” Workmen are pinched, kindly
impulses are strangled, the bright ambition of
manly industry dies with the attainment of
wealth, and the fruits of success are cast before
swine as the result of monarchial influence upon
society. With the abolition of royal glamour
the chief inducement to snobbery, which is the
germ of so-called “loyalty,” would be abol-
ished. How much suffering and degradation
does humanity owe to its own inherent selfish-
ness, and what is the Royal Family but a Royal
Society for the Encouragement of Mean Ideals,
and the Promotion of Pitiful Ambition ?
The America that Washington dreamed of
might have come to pass save for those
European circles of social distinction into which
the almighty dollar is a passport. Yankee
plutocrats trample upon the banner of frater-
nity in their anxiety to make the acquaintance
of a visiting earl, and a Mackay piles
gold that his wife may buy a disreputable
prince for her girl borne of her own
body. A monarch of the existing type creates
baneful uses for money. Men who start in life
with good intentions as to the employment of
the capital they toil for, are ultimately seduced
into the ranks of title-seekers and tuft-hunters.
The evil can be traced to the monarchial system
as surely as that bad system is traceable to the
teachings of a priesthood which entitles God the
“ King of Kings.”
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Reign of Brummagem.
Dear Bulletin, —Your correspondent, “Corn-
stalk,” argues from the patent fact that the
foreign-horn grab most of the Australian poli-
tical billets, that they are more enterprising
than the Australians. His inference is wrong.
True it is the Tommy Dodds, Holmans,
Bradleys, Rosas, make most noise in the poli-
tical field—not because they have more push
than the native-born, but from the fact that
they belong to the numericaily-stronger part of
the population. It is not a question of political
ethics but of simple proportion. I have gone
through the census-reports of all the provinces
and find that out of 1,090,000 men of legal age
only 405,000 are Australian-born ! Put the lest
of age up to 30 years, and of 734,000 not more
than 203,000 were born in this country ! The
Australians over 30 years are 40,000 less
numerous than the English, and very little
more than twice the Irish ! For the seven pro-
vinces the figures are :
As the bulk of the politicians are men over 30,
the Australians are scarcely entitled to one
place in four, and that is just about the propor-
tion of phices they contrive to secure. There is
not one province in which the Australians of
adult age come to more than three-fourths of
the foreign-born, while in Queensland they are
less, and in Maoriland scarcely more than one-
fourth ! If the people who make the sentiment
of the country are alone considered —those over
30 years of age —there is no province that can
boast more than sixty Australians to every
hundred of the imported article, while in
Maoriland the proportion is less than twelve,
and in Queensland less than five to the
hundred.
These figures offer all the explanation that is
needed of Patterson’s frothy invitation to May
and George, the twenty-one guns in honour of
the birth of a princeling, Suttor’s journey of
10,000 miles to move a resolution congratulating
Queen Victoria on the commencement of her 57th


year of office, the almost unanimous passage of
the Naval Tribute Bill through the Parliaments,
and many a like proceeding. Not every man
born in Australia loves las country, and there
are but few British or foreign-born whose Aus-
tralian sentiments will stand much wear and
tear. Protestations do not count tor much,
else LiLLEY would not have accepted a title nor
Seddon pined for one. The majority do not
speak of “Home” without meaning to endorse
the sentiment that the term implies—they are
sojourners in a strange land. No man ever
lived who had the feelings of a patriot towards
any country except the one in which he was
born and nurtured. Resentment against one s
mother-land is a common enough fading, but
patriotism towards an adopted country is made
of different stuff. What imported patriot
would not whoop as loudly for Paraguay as he
does to-day for Australia if the cons.deralion
received warrantee} the change ! 1 he man who
looks for true Australian sentiment from othei
than Australian born, indulges a vain hope
My arithmetic should show him he need not
expect such sentiment to be matured until the
native-born predominate, which will not >e
until more than 20 years are counted out.—
Theodore Woinakski.
Prohibition Goes Under.
The people of the prohibition settlement of
Mildura, Vic., have decided, by a solid majority,
that they want their dry and desolate town put
on the same footing—in the matter of liquor—
as the rest of the province. Prohibition has
had a fair trial in Mildura, and has panned out
miserably. There are more drink-shops in it
than in any other town of its size, and also
more drink, and the drink is more expensive
and more execrable than anywhere else in Vic-
toria. The police cannot put it down, except
by arresting practically the whole population ;
they are in the position of a small boy em-
ployed to keep the flies off a decayed carcase,
and as they can’t chase all the flies at once it
follows that, even in their times of wildest
activity, anyone cafi get raving drunk at Mil-
dura at the shortest notice. The Mildura drink-
sellers are difficult to convict, for the popular
sympathies are with them —that the populace
should sympathise with the vendors of such
awfulliquorsfls remarkable, but presumably they
do it because it is the best drink obtainable.
The local grog-dealers run their trade day and
night, Sundays and week-days; and as they
have to make up the amount of their fines as
well as ordinary trade profits they charge
exorbitant prices and- sell their compounds in
unclean cellars and dens to avoid observation.
Even the prohibitionists who go to Mildura
often grow disgusted with their own creed,
which they find to be the drunkest creed ever
invented. As might be expected, however, the
popular decision that Mildura wants to run in
future on ordinary local-option principles has
roused the Victorian teetotal party to fury.
Wherever liquor is legalised, that party demands
that the local majority shall have power to
decide whether it shall be sold or not; but in
Mildura it isn’t legalised, and the proposal that
the majority there shall have the same power
as the majority everywhere else has caused
every Cold Tea fanatic in the land to rear up
and protest. The teetotal creed is simply that
the majority should rule where Cold Tea is in
the majority, and that the minority should rule
where Cold Tea is in the minority. Which
short and simple Confession of Faith only
amounts to the decision that Cold Tea should
prevail at all times and under all circum-
stances
The “ Depression.”
Now that the New South Wales elections are at
hand the “ prevailing depression ” is being run
by the Foreign-trade press for all it is worth—
which isn’t very much. Almost every article
of common consumption is cheaper now in New
South Wales under the blighting influences of
partial Protection, than it was three or four
years ago under the “ Freetrade ” regime ; and
as the shoddy press has always circulated the
industrious lie that Protection makes all things
dear instead of cheap, 1 this result is set down in
a hazy fashion to the same old depression.
There is nothing else that it can be set down to
which won’t utterly give away the Freetrade
superstition, so the,depression is dragged in as
a matter of necessity. But when the fall of
prices is cousideretl from the producer’s stand-
point—when the same papers are talking about
the situation of the seller instead of that of the
buyer —the result is put down with a dull thud
to the horrors of Protection in its worst shape.
This method of looking at the same fact from
two different sides produces a curious state of
logic. When an article which used to fetch Bd.
in the good old days is now sold for fid., the
fact that the buyer has only to pay fid. is owing
to the depression, while the other fact that the
seller only receives fid. is another convincing
evidence of the cussedness of the present tariff
The obvious fact, which is entirely ignored, is
that the depression is a very old institution in
the land, and that it was in full blast in
the shoddy days just as it is now. More-
over, when the Foreign-trade press isn’t
lamenting about how Protection has made
prices low for the seller, and explaining
about how depression has made them low for
the buyer, it generally devotes itself to publish-
ing theoretical essays about the awful manner
in which Protection enhances prices, and the
way it lays ponderous burdens on the backs of
the poor, and taxes the masses for the benefit of
a handful of bloated monopolists. When it is
in this mood it flatly denies the reduction in
prices altogether, and only curses the depression
as a side-issue which has arisen somehow
through the Dibbs tariff. Altogether Foreign-
trade is in an even more confused state than
usual just now, and the old spinal curvature of
its intelligence has assumed an aggravated
form.
Hume Nisbet’s Romancing 1 .
The coming Australian novelist will have, when
he arrives, a rather hard job cut out for him. He
will have to get the English reader to unlearn
almost everything that former novelists have
taught him about the conditions of life on our
continent. To judge from the class of books
accepted as typical of Australia the average reader
must suppose life in the bush to be a long series
of hand to hand conflicts with remarkably
ferocious bushrangers, combined with much drink-
ing, shooting of aboriginals, and shouting of coo-ee.
It was an evil day for us when Hume Nisbet for-
sook painting for novel writing. His latest insult
to this country, called “ A Bush Girl’s Romance,
is simply a mass of childish nonsense not even
redeemed by decent writing, and yet it is gravely
asserted in reviews that it bears the stamp of
truth. Nay, more, the author has the brazen
front to assert in his preface that his awful out-
pouring is “ a true picture of Australia in its
western portion.” In the beginning we make the
acquaintance of the familiar traveller who is
approaching a salt lake, and who thus soliloquises :
“ Ten days since I have tasted anything except
gum leaves. Rive days since I had my last taste
of water, and on my back I carry a thou-
sand pounds in nuggets.” After such an
unheard - of spell of endurance he naturally
falls senseless and is rescued by _ three
horsemen who come up at “ a swinging
gallop”—of course, every one always rides at a
gallop in the Australian bush. These horsemen
are well-dressed in fashionable clothes, and, natur-
ally, they are bushranghrs. This is simply a
sample of the wild absurdities crammed into the
volume. Farther on Mr. Nisbet grows serious
and states that—“ln Australia, where the Govern-
ment murder men, women, and infants, as the
Sepoys are said to have murdered the wives and
children of our soldiers, it is called by the mild
and inoffensive term of dispersing.” After this
sweeping charge he goes on to say that —
“ The aboriginal is trapped, poisoned, shot, bayo-
netted, and otherwise destroyed, as energetically
as they are trying to destroy those other pests, the
rabbits.” Now, considering that in. the two
rabbit-infested provinces of N.S. Wales and Vic-
toria it would be impossible to find a myall native
to poison or bayonet, Mr. Hume Nisbet is certainly
a first-class Munchausen on the face of it. Here
is another little gem, anent the treatment of black
gins : “ As half-caste children are reckoned to be
inconvenient and dangerous as evidence of im-
morality, which Government has to punish when
discovered . . . the savage mothers are de-
puted to destroy them.” Naturally, proba-
bility is scouted throughout the work. Gold
is picked up in nuggets scattered loosely
around on the surface; the blacks poison
their spears with the venom of the “ deaf-adder, ”
&c., &c. And this puerile trash, worse than the
extravagances of a penny novel of the “Deadwood
Dick ” series, is received in all faith as a true
picture of Australia. We have partly ourselves
to blame for it. Our own writers of fiction have
a sneaking affection for the convict and the bush-
ranger, and did not some warlike “team” or
other give a graphic display in London of a
combat between robbers and the military, alleged
to be so common here? Really it seems that
when our novelist does put in an appearance he
will be received with discredit as a man who
knows nothing about Australia, unless he wades
in gore and brains all through three volumes.
A parson has painted a fancy picture of
“ Christ in Melbourne,” repudiating the idea
that He would “walk up and down Bourke-
street in the unpicturesque garb and talking
the everyday language of a modern artisan.”
“ Suppose Christ were to come to Melbourne ! ”
says this clerical visionary. Well, The Bul-
letin will suppose the result:—
At a meeting held in Sydney last Friday to
consider the famous Costa Rica Packet case,
Mr. “Jack” Want, Q.C., took occasion to
point out the base ingratitude of Britain in
this matter, considering how N.S. Wales came
to her assistance with the famous Soudan Con-
tingent some years ago. This is the sort of
bunkum which makes any calm and collected
Cornstalk desire to go out and hide himself up
a tree in the far wilderness till the awful
Soudan fiasco is entirely forgotten—if it ever
will be forgotten. Only the most brassy
kind of barrister would dig up that lament-
able episode, nowadays, and describe it
seriously as “coming to the assistance” of
Britain. The only thing that is certain about
the contingent, barring the bill, is that Britain
didn’t know what on earth to do with it when
it came, and was very much embarrassed by
its presence all through. Also, there is every
reason to believe that the beloved mother
country was very glad indeed to see the last of
it when it went away, and vowed most
solemnly never to have any more contingents of
the kind if it could possibly be avoided. The
polite, though stern, refusal given to the offers
of various other contingents from adjacent
provinces, also suggests that Britain awoke to
an understanding of the situation at a very
early date. Probably the recollection of that
ghastly event has something to do with the
mother-country’s present unsatisfactory attitude
in the Costa Rica Packet case. Hingland, it
may be, has been brooding over the Contingent
episode ever since, and now takes the first
opportunity to get level with New South Wales
for that irruption. Humour isn’t the average
Briton’s strong point, and the idea of sending a
kind of PuNCH-and-JuDY show-including field-
artillery horsed with ’bus mokes that wouldn t
stir a yard until they heard a noise like unto that
of a ’bus door slamming—to his assistance at a
time when he had plenty of stern realities in
hand, may have seemed to him rather a ill-
timed pleasantry.
J. A. Andkews, a Sydney anarchist of a very
tame variety, was fined <£‘2o last week in the
Water Police-court, and two other persons
were fined <£s each, for distributing a pamphlet
called “ A Handbook of Anarchy without an
imprint. The alternative in each case was
three months imprisonment, and as Andrews
and his friends had no money they were sent to
gaol to consort with felons. Now, there was
an imprint on the pamphlet, though not a
printer’s imprint, to wdt : “ Issued by J. A.
Andrews, late of Mudgee, and now 7 of 491
Elizabeth-street, Sydney.” The spirit of the
law, which merely seeks to fix the responsi-
bility of issue, was thus complied with, and as
the defendants most likely sinned against its
letter in ignorance of the breach of technicality
the punishment was vindictive and cruel.
There can be no doubt that the prosecution
was influenced by -the character of the
views supposed to be put forward by Andrews.
Had his pamphlet been a fulsome congratula-
tion of York’s wife for having added another
royalty to the burdens of the British taxpayer,
there would have been no prosecution what-
ever. Andrews’ views w 7 ere moderate and in-
telligent, if not very novel, and he expressly
points out in his book that there is nothing to
support the common delusion that anarchy is
synonymous with a policy of violence. To
degrade the Government by such cow'ardly
exhibitions of official malevolence is the surest
way to create anarchy in Australia.
A meeting of portly citizens w 7 as held last week
in Sydney to consider the political situation
and to urge the community to vote for “good
men ” only at the forthcoming general election.
The meeting also passed a resolution that what
the country wanted was not so much politics or
parties or political principles as a strong deter-
mination to return only the “ very best men.”
The crowd which passed this resolution con-
sisted largely of wool-brokers, merchants,
lawyers, money-lenders (Mr. Rogalsky was
much in evidence), financiers, brewers, account-
ants, importers, spirit-dealers, stock-and-
station agents, auctioneers, softgoodsmen,
and others of the kind, and these
gentlemen evidently regard themselves as fair
samples of the kind’of men who were wanted if
the bleeding country is to be saved. There were
many sleek, elderly men among them ; and a
few unhealthy-looking, flaccid persons with
those little bags of skin under their eyes which
suggest kidney-disease and a tendency to break
up suddenly and unexpectedly ; and a number
with large, dough-coloured double chins. There
was hardly one in the crowd who has ever been
heard of as doing anything specially good for
the benefit of anybody, but they were obviously
solid on the assumption that they were the
“ very best men,” and formed an interesting
mutual admiration society on the strength of
it. Probably enough they were right in their
assumption after all. For the good man, as
the term is understood in financial circles, is
not the man who has ever done any good, or
who has ever advocated anything good ; it is
the copious, affluent, well-dressed individual
whose feet have a solid grip upon the earth,
and who has a deep, port-wine laugh. And the
verv best men have all these symptoms, and
are blessed in addition with stomachs of great
magnitude, on account of which the} 7 haven’t
seen their own feet for the best part of a
generation.
The harassing block of New South Wales
Supreme Court law-suits compels public atten-
tion once again to the law-“ vacation ” ques-
tion. On the three lists for the term just
concluded there were 199 causes set down for
hearing. The Judges have now gone into mid-
winter vacation, and more than half of those
causes are, with machine-like frigidity, left
over to the September term. This may spell
ruin to many of the litigants to whom delay
means inability to continue their usual busi-
nesses ; or it may only mean “short commons,’
or the dropping of, perhaps, righteous claims.
Even to the man with a well-lilled purse, it
means extra expense. Only the lawyers benefit
by it. In an abstract consideration of the pro-
tecting potency of justice, the law, in a free
country, should be approachable all the year
round. If, as matters now 7 stand, the vacations
in vogue are absolutely necessary to the
periodical recuperation of the Judges, then
additional acting-Judges should be commis-
sioned to hear the cause-list through to the
very last case. It is scandalous that over 100
Supreme Court cases should be shelved for tw r o
months in order that their Honors may take a
three-weeks’ holiday.
The compulsory residents of Pentridge stockade
show a growing disposition to “bash” warders,
and the Yic.~ Solicitor-General proposes to
abolish this scandal with a new Bill. The new
Bill is to be a brief, free-and-easy measure,
enabling prisoners to get flogged at a minute’s
notice, more or less, for an “unprovoked
assault ” upon a warder. There is no doubt in
the mind of the Government as to the gratuitous
villainy of these prison outbreaks. Patterson
and his lamblike brethren have never taken the
trouble to notice that Pentridge “ discipline,”
which dates back to the days of John Price,
is in itself a provocation to bang the first uni-
formed myrmidon who comes near. Lawanorder
has no eyes for flaws in its precious penal system.
The duty of society is to keep out of Pentridge,
and, if a section of society gets in, it must take
Pentridge as it finds that place, and love the
warders, and be always good. Patterson and
Co. would support a Bill for walloping sinners
who committed assaults upon Beelzebub when
they were “doing their little bit” in hell,
without any consideration to the possible defects
of hell as a school of repentance.
If Christ to Melbourne shortly came,
A bearer of salvation,
Some “leading men ” (whom we could name)
Would meet Him at the station,
Whilst soldiers warded off the crowd,
And “ bobby ” waved his truncheon,
The boomers, singing praises loud.
Would take their Lord to luncheon.
Would drive Him off to Mister ’May a.
And welcome Him with speeches,
They’d chaperon Him everywhere,
They’d stick to Him like leeches.
With upraised eye, and accent bland,
And Sunday best behaviour,
That puffy, pawky chosen baud
Would glorify the Saviour.
When “ confidence” was quite restored
By these religious-sectors,
They’d start a bank and swear the Lord
Was chairman of directors;
And, as the cash deposits swelled,
They’d use the old devices
For working off the land they held
At most abnormal prices.
Ah ! if He but to Melbourne came!
No Jews would now despise Him ;
The Fat Men of financial fame
Would boldly advertise Him,
And, when He left them to their fraud,
They’d rise at greasy dinners,
To bless their dear departed Lord,
Who came to ruin sinners.

370 GEORGE STREET, SYDNEY (next G.P.0.)
The Wild Oat Column.
The B.N.Z. reconstructed last week, for the third
time within seven years. In 1888 this institution wrote
Off £300,000 of capital and about £600,000 of reserve fund
in one fatal act, to cover losses, and having thus wiped off
the accumulated results of years of reckless trading in the
boom period, It started with a clean sheet, and called up
more capital. Right up to the time of this disaster the
balance-sheets represented it as a solvent and flourishing
Concern, and the loss of £900,000 was a woeful disillusion-
ment. Next year another thunderbolt fell from a clear
•ky, and £BOO,OOO more capital was written off, the alleged
oleanlng-up of 1888 having been as unreliable as the pre-
vious state of alleged prosperity. After that the B.N.Z.
went on steadily. It was everywhere believed that the
revelations of 1889 included all the bad debts and disasters
of the old rotten days ; the institution paid a humble 5 per
cent. div. regularly, and began to gather up a new reserve
in a small way ; it issued £500,000 more capital, and the
old shareholders buried their dead cash and made the best
of the situation.
Last week, however, ib was suddenly announced
in the Maoriland Parliament that the B.N.Z. was once
more in a desperate situation, and apparently a fresh
batch of “revelations” is at hand. The situation was so
awful that a bill was rushed through the House in one
sitting, to provide lor the issue of £2,000,000 worth of
preference shares, said shares, and a 4 per cent, dividend
thereon, being guaranteed by the State. Half-a-million
is also to be called up from the present unlucky share-
holders, a circumstance which, to many of them, must
mean utter ruin. The head office, which was shifted to
London at the time of the last mishap, is to be removed
to Wellington; the accounts are to be constantly
inspected by Government auditors, the management is to
be subject to the direction of the Treasurer, and the
chairman of directors is to be appointed by the Executive
Council. The new preference capital is nominally repay-
able at par in 10 years, and in the event of default the
Government will appoint a receiver, which will be practi-
cally equivalent to taking over the B.N.Z. and making it
a State institution.
It would probably have been more satisfactory
if the State had taken over the bank bodily on the spot.
The troubles of that lamentable concern seem endless,
and, though it is doubtless good policy to avert the crash
which was imminent, the device of guaranteeing any
private institution, no matter under what limitations, is
a preordained failure. The B.N.Z. is not an affair of the
first magnitude, yet in seven years it has written off
£1,200,000 of the shareholders’ money as absolutely lost.
It has issued £500,000 of new capital, it proposes now to
call up £500,000 more, and it still requires £2,000,000 under
a State guarantee to keep it afloat. To all intents and
purposes, therefore, it seems to have got into difficulties
to the extent of £4,000,000, which ghastly record
is hardly calculated to inspire confidence in the future.
Considering the humble 5 per cent, which it has paid on
its present capital of £900,000, the prospects of ordinary
shareholders for the next few years, after the dividend of
4 per cent, on £2,000,000 of preference capital is pro-
vided for, seem to be about nil. The impending call will
be a melancholy experience for many shareholders.
Maoriland had a childlike faith in its big bank in former
years, and the fortunes of many widows and orphans was
invested in B.N.Z. shares in the days when that institu-
tion was founded on a rock. There will be very little
left of these fortunes when the third reconstruction is
completed.
During the former troubles the B.N.Z. shifted
its headquarters to London, with that humble faith which
the “ kawlinist ” has always manifested in the capacity of
the British financier. The result shows that the British
financier is very ordinary clay, after all.
The fatality which has followed the B.N.Z is
another warning to that dying father who leaves his
family a small fortune invested in hank shares, and then
passes away with a blissful consciousness that their
future is provided for. Australia is a very new country,
yet it can probably show already as many dead banks as
it can banks that are yet alive. It will probably show a
good many more dead banks before the close of the
century. The’visible moral is that every bank, like every
human being, dies sooner or later, and the best than can
be hoped is that it will go later. Generally, however, it
goes sooner. How many unquiet ghosts of dead husbands
and fathers must roam around the sites of the old Bank
of Australia, the three defunct banks of S.A., the two
Meroantiles, the Federal, the Bank of Van Diemen’s Land,
the Provincial and Suburban, the forgotten Australian
and European, the twin Orientals, the Bank of Queens-
land, the Bank of Sydney and the old-time Bank of Port
Phillip. It is less than 80 years since the first Australian
bank was founded—and what an awful record 1
• * * *
According to the cabled report, the B.N.Z.
officials only realised last week the straits to which their
office was reduced. Judging by the state of the share-
market, however, it would appear as if some person had
realised the situation, or a portion of it, a good many
months ago, and judiciously rushed his shares on the
market accordingly. Who was that person, and where
did he get his information ?

The balance-sheet of the reconstructed London
Bank of Australia is a depressing document for the
ordinary shareholder, and none too cheering for the pre-
ference animal. During the five months ended 31st Dec.
it earned a net profit of barely £6OOO, out of which it pays
a dividend of 5J per cent, to preference shareholders, and
carries £2OOO forward. As the preference shareholders
represent only one-sixth of the capital, the chances of the
ordinary shareholders getting anything for some years to
come seem infinitesimal. The appalling shrinkage is attri-
buted, as usual, to the reconstruction troubles, hut as the
interest on that overwhelming item, “ bills discounted,
loans and other securities in London and the colonies,
£6,350,000,” booms along serenely in wet weather and dry,
the explanation is difficult of comprehension. If these
six millions of investments really did yield the alleged
profits of last year it would be interesting to know what
blight has fallen on them since. And if they didn’t, why
was it alleged that they did? This same conundrum
glares forth from the balance-sheets of all the recon-
structed banks, with about two exceptions, and the only
coherent theory is that the profits of past days consisted
largely of irrecoverable interest charged against the over-
drafts of more or less stony customers. Which over-
drafts, by the way, generally figure as assets to this day,
and form part of that historic item, “ bills discounted and
all other securities, so many millions.”
• * • *
The Abgus suggests that the depositors in re-
constructed banks are receiving 4J per cent, interest “at
the expense of the community,” and it argues that “ the
present dispensation cannot last." The obvious corollary
is to repudiate the agreement to pay 4J and renew at 3
per cent, for so much of eternity as the banks are likely
to last. Now, it Hancock had talked this way, we’d have
laughed, but to listen to such a mastodon specimen of
contract-breaking from the only Argus makes the tears
sizzle down one’s nose.

The Bulletin’s remarks re the Yic. Savings
Bank’s losses have borne good fruit, in the shape of
Tucker’s motion for a return of the Commissioners mort-
gages alive and foreclosed. And now to plant another
seed. Let Mr. Tucker call for a further return specifying
the mortgages in which Savings Banks Commissioners
are, or are not, personally interested, so as to give the lie
direct to the rumour current in Melb. that at least one
mortgage is so tainted. We disbelieve the canard, which
must have been feathered and Winged by someone looking
out for a Credit Fonoier directorship;

The German Bank of England note-forgers

Matt. Larkin, the jolly embezzler of South Mel-
bourne, has once more been served in Pentridge prison
with criminal summonses, charging him with further
separate embezzlements amounting in all to £5389. Con-
trast this steady pursuit of a caged convict, whose
friends have evidently deserted him in his adversity,
after helping to squander stolen moneys, and the enthusi-
astic and almost reverential adoration of even bigger male-
factors who have got off scot free, by potent influences
that won’t bear scrutiny.

It may interest Australians (Smellbournians in

N.S.W. Insolvency-Registrar Henry indicated
by his remarks when suspending a bankrupt’s certificate
last week, that he considers a man who trades on money
borrowed at 15 per cent, has no reasonable or probable
expectation of being able to pay his debts. It may be
impossible to fix a rule in such matters, but the opinion
is suggestive.

The very latest in insurance. You apply to
half-a-dozen offices for work as a canvasser, giving as
reference a well-known M.L.A. His reference is honoured,
and in several cases you get the appointment. Then you
write, stating that you are just starting to round-up the
residents, and will the office be so kind as to send you a
hand-bag to carry your documents in? Some of them are
delighted to do it. Having secured six hand-bags on the
cheap, you then start to rake in fountain-pens, type-
writers, and other things on the same system. All goes
well until two managers happen to meet at lunch, and
start to compare notes about you.

Labourers on private building contracts in
Sydney are now working for 4Jd. an hour, because con-
tracts are taken by men of straw for next to nothing. On
receiving the first advance in coin for work accomplished,
it frequently happens that the snide contractor simply
vanishes without remembering to pay his wages men. A
builder who called recently for tenders for the erection of
a small brick cottage received 108 applications. The
tenders for brickwork ranged from £l4 to £46 ; those
for the carpentering, from £l6 to £6O. The differences
between these minima and maxima convey some idea of
the gulf in financial calibre that lies between the man
who does and him who does not pay his workmen.

Scene, Hobart a week or two ago. Present,
mining-expert and Mount Hoaxley shareholder. Latter
demands, as old friend, expert’s private opinion re the

The men charged with salting Mt. Hoaxley

A man who, a few weeks ago, was so desperately
anxious to be “in ” Mount Huxley that he paid £7O for a
£25 share, now writes to a Hobart sharebroker seeking to
recover £45 from the vendor. “No conscientious man,”
he writes, “ would stain his soul by retaining money thus
acquired.” His request opens up a wide field of conjec-
ture as to what his own action would have been had
Huxley realised Mr. Samuel’s fond expectations, and the
shares gone up “ kite high.”

The disgraceful thing about the new find at
Coolgardie—“a second Bayley’a”—is that the discoverers
are all “other aiders." Mills is a N.S.W. station-hand,
Carter, Gardiner, and Dawson also come from N.S.W.,
and Huxley and Elliott from Victoria. Conservative
Westralian disgust is immeasurable. Almost as bad is the
fact that the party are nearly all new-chum miners.
Elliott is an old hand, and Dawson has handled a pick
before, but all the rest are amateurs. That such men
should drop across “the grandest patch of gold yet un-
earthed in the world,” a mile from a main road where
thousands of diggers have passed, ana only 10 or 12 miles
from Coolgardie township, is merely another illustration
of the truism that luck is everything in gold-mining.
The description of the treasure is pretty tall;
“The gold was as thick and as big as plums in a rich
Christmas pudding, and where the gold plums ended the
gold currants commenced. In some of the stone there
appears to be a band of solid gold.” When ‘Big Ben’
was hauled out one or two of the strongest strained them-
selves to lift him. He weighs over 3001 b., and has
several ribs of gold, and his internal arrangements seem
to consist very largely of that metal. Big Ben has been
considered good enough by Elliot to purchase for £2OOO,
and some say Elliott will make over £lOOO on the deal.
Besides Big Ben were quite a number of little Bens,
several containing over lOOoz. each."
“ The show is better than anything ever seen in
Bayley’s Reward. The ironstone, with which reef gold is
usually associated in the district, is entirely absent. The
gold is carried in clear quartz, slightly amber-tinted.
The mine is marvellously rich in coarse, wiry gold, of a
bright colour, the metal being so thickly scattered
through the stone that after the rock is fractured it has
to be wrenched apart. The stone is close-grained. Every
piece broken shows the faces of the fracture to consist of
nearly one-third gold. The excavation, from which fully
£25,000 in dollied gold and specimens have already been
obtained, is not sufficiently large for bringing in a Shet-
land pony. The rich shoot stood up 3ft. above the sur-
face. When Mills found it it required no prospecting to
discover it. Mills said he could see the gold 20ft. away
sticking out of the solid white quartz as well as the noon-
day sun. He hung his hat on one of the gold junks.
The find was kept dark from May 8 till June 26
—seven weeks—while the men, armed, slept over their El
Dorado every night. At last the secret leaked out. The
jumping brigade began operations at once by collaring
two outside leases of four and five acres which the party
had taken up. They even tried to upset the central lease
of 25 acres, but the warden refused to receive the com-
plaint. “The curse of Coolgardie is jumping," says
Mills, the finder of the Londonderry. Mills only went to
Coolgardie in March, so he hasn’t been long in making bis
fortune. The others were scarcely older residents.
Already two of the party have sold their inter-
ests. Henry Dawson, an elderly man, whose family reside
at Summer Hill, Sydney, has transferred to Huxley and
Mills for £3ooo—on the better-sure-than-sorry principle.
Another—a young Sydneyite, Carter—has also sold to
Elliott for £3OOO ; and Elliott bought “ Big Ben ” for
£2OOO. The holders are now four—Elliott, one-third
share; Huxley and Mills, one quarter share each: and
Gardener, one-sixth. Will the gold go down? That is
the great question. If the reef extends 100 feet at the
present rate of richness, says the Telegraph special, the
Londonderry is worth a million of money. Anyhow, the
show is good enough for £25,000 to be offered and refused.

Even Bayley’s finds itself of secondary moment
in the glare of the Coolgardie find. The Sheriff still holds
on to Cosgrove's Bayley’s South; Shaw’s South Extended
reports very rich gold in the parallel reef, worked from
the surface. The Emerald mine at Yalgoo has been
bought by a Maorilander named Stanley, of Dunedin, for,
it is said, £15,000 and one-sixth interest.

Zeb. Lane, writes a Bulletin correspondent,
does not seem to have got into the very best hands in
London. The city, by-the-way, is full of plausible fellows
who could talk a duck off a pond, and who profess to be
able to do wonders in the shape of raising capital. “ You
give me the option of the property, my boy/’ they say to
an owner, “ and I’ll eat my hat if I can’t find capital to
the extent of £lOO,OOO in 24 hours." The bait is taken,
and then these “ hawkers ” run the rounds trying to find
someone to deposit £lOO, or £2OO, caution-money, the
result being that the property they are trying to finance
gets known as a shady one, and no one in the end will
touch it. I don’t say that this is quite the crowd that
Zeb. has fallen in with ; still, he hasn’t had the luck of
Austin, who shaped differently, 'with the result that his
trip was a great success. Any really good Westralian
mine, worked or unworked, has a good chance of being
floated just now, but Bayley’s itself would prove a frost if
taken in hand by any of the noble army of “ hawkers.”

Wyalong (N.S.W.) is a drouthy field. Ib
already possesses 11 pubs, open, with several more in
course of erection, while every third or fourth house is a
sly-grog shanty. It has six “ working-men’s clubs ”
some of them boozing-kens and gambling-dens in an
easily penetrable disguise.

A new arrival on the Murchison, an old miner
named York, has struck a rich patch in a reef he opened
up, the other day, about J-mile S.W. from the Day Dawn.
A portion of the stone is of extraordinary value.

A large exodus of diggers has taken place from
the Murchison to Lake Carey, about 300 miles S.E. from
Cue. A party of prospectors arrived for provisions, with,
it is said, 300 oz. Hence the rush.

Dear Bulletin, —The reports about the fever at
Cue, and other parts of this field, have been much
exaggerated. During the past five months only 18 deaths
have occurred from that and other causes. The climate
is most healthy and exhilarating.—O.H.T., Cue, 12th
June, 1894.

Sydney factory girls work 14 hours a day—from

The telegraph-line will reach Coolgardie within

The promoters of the Murchison Battery Co.
erected a splendid 10-head at Cue, and have since spent
about four months vainly seeking for water, which they
should first have found. Now they are considering the
advisability of shifting the plant, being unable to procure
sufficient water to work it. Day Dawn South Battery Co.
have got plenty of water, having been flooded at 70ft.
They will shortly be crushing for the public, to the great
joy of the smaller mine-holders.

An influential committee has been formed to
promote the driving of a crosscut across Bendigo at right
angles to the lines of reefs so as to intersect the innumer-
able small lodes which are known to exist. As the work
partakes of a national character, Government is to be
asked to help. Bendigo district is a network of reefs,
and the crosscut will discover lodes which no number of
shafts would find.

The prospectus of the White Feather Pro-
prietary Gold Co., printed elsewhere, is worth looking at.
The Bulletin hasn’t seen the show itself; but it has read
the expert’s report. The public are only asked for
£6250, and £6250 goes to the company’s credit, the
vendors being satisfied to take their price in shares—a
healthy sign. The names of the directorate indicate that
investors will get a fair run for their money.

The Day Dawn, Murchison, is erecting another
10 head of stamps. At present it has only 10 heads
on a 14-foot lode, having been unable in the past to get
enough water for more than 10 heads.

Mills’ Day Dawn United, Charters Towers,
early in January, ’93, found the reef in the main underlie
shaft, at a depth on the incline of 2000 ft. from the sur-
face, to be no less than 19ft. thick ; it has subsequently
been found to reach even 26ft. Since then the reef has
maintained its great size, and the quartz has improved in
richness. The output for 1893 was 24,048 tons m excess
of that for ’92, and is now proceeding at the rate of 4000
tons per tnonlh with no signs whatever of diminution. In
1890 the ore averaged only 15dwts. per ton, in 1891 it im-
proved to ISdwts., in 1892 it increased to loz. Odwt. 2grs.,
and in 1893 the average per ton reached loz. 2dwts. 9grs.
It pays nearly £lOO,OOO a year in diva, (on a capital of
£300,000), and looks as if it would last 20 or 80 years OB
the Day Dawn reef alone.

"The Bulletin’s” Missing Word
Competition. No. 15.
The above closed with 8333 guesses, which, at Is.
each, made a total of <£4lo 13s. The problem
set was as follows “ The jurymen in the Mont-
gomery-Williams case having found the prisoners
guilty, the latter were sentenced to death, accord-
ing to Botany Bay law. The jury subsequently
petitioned for the men’s reprieve, on the ground
that they did not believe Montgomery and Wil-
liams meant murder at all. The jury’s verdict
was not in accordance with their belief, but it was
in keeping with their oath, which was to find a
verdict according to Botany Bay law, the brutal
and law which drags a man into
the jury-box and, offering him in such cases as the
present no alternative between hanging and
acquitting, really compels him to commit
either murder or perjnry.” The missing
word, “ INDISORIMINATING,” was sent in
by 18 persons, but as one forwarded two and
another five successful guesses, the pool has to be
cut up into 23 dividends of i>lB 2s. 3d. each.
Excepting that one enthusiass sent in “ Horse-
hair” as his guess, the competition presented no
specially humorous features. It will be noticed
that no less than eight dividends go to Inverell,
N. ; and that Mr. M’llveen, who secured a

My Dear Mookabinda—■
Tempe ball was a whirling spectacle this year,
crowded with an exceeding crowd and beautifully
stage-managed. The rather difficult floor of the
Centennial Hall was worked up to perfection (it
was like a ploughed field at the F. A.L. ball), and
a very special feature was the poultry supper in
the basement, set on tastily-decorated tables and
tented round with bunting. The Tempe ball
supper was the best-done charity sandwich-
struggle of the season. And it was served up
before 11 besides—a proof of how much ammuni-
tion the committee had laid on. The worst thing
about the hop was the way in which the hall was
dolled up. Big, untidy bows of flimsy rag and
paralytic greenery are not my notion of wall-
gardening. The V.R, elevation wasn’t more
hideous than usual, only that a big card with the
name of the lending firm printed large made the
Satronesses look as if they were camping on
lahogany and Co.’s exhibit at a furniture-show,
just to demonstrate how the dais looked “on the
figure.” But the whole of the decorations wanted
straightening up~for instance, the rendezvous all
hung like train-signals when a puff-puff’s coming.
Gov. and Lady Duff were not on view, out of
(purely official) respect to the memory of M.
Carnot, but all the “suite” were there, squiring
pretty Miss Duff (in black, and carrying a ton-
weight “committee” bouquet) and her sister,
looking sleepy in pale-pink. Mrs. Bowden-Smith
wore a brocade gown. Mayoress Manning was in
pale-yellow brocade, and big posy of yellow roses,
and Mrs. RobertPrendergast in jet-sprinkled black
gown, with large damask roses on the corsage.
Mrs. W. F. Brennan was half-hidden by her
bouquet; Miss Annie M'Donagh (one of the hon.
secs.) wore a modish turn-out of sunlight-yellow
poplin, with lashings of real lace, and huge posy
of yellow roses and Czar violets.
The fancy-set dressing wasn’t very capricious.
Miss Ida Gilles cut the nicestfigure in the daffodil
set (all black gowns, poudre hair, and Directoire
sticks adorned with daffodils). The Red Riding-
Hood set (got up by Throsby Robertson) was


With reference to a statement in its recent

bright and novel, though one of the little Red
Riding-Hoods looked more like the wolf than the
heroine of the tragedy. The autumn-leaves square
was quaint—but the men spoilt the fancy sets, as
they almost always do. Unless you can scare up
four uniforms (with something inside ’em, of
course), or a quartette of conceited youths, who
will face a critical world with deep crochet lace
round velveteen knickerbockers and Cavalier hats
on one ear, you had better renounce fancy seta as
vain things, for the waiter costume is enough to
blot out the “ fancy ” aspect of comic-opera chorus.
Mrs. (Dr.) Mailler-Kendal wore a very Frenchy
costume of white brocade and satin, the wide
re vers effectively edged with brown fur ; hair
poudre and bouquet of roses; Mrs. “Dick”
Richards, in cream bengaline and Irish lace, was
neatly groomed, but the place was peppered with
impossibilities. Imagine any maiden hanging a
bunch of dead violets under her offside ear with
poor, dear Ophelia as a warning ! Or a charmer,
m white, with one white plume on her collar-bone
and another in her hair, like a cockatoo that has
moulted down to two feathers. Giddy-looking
bon-bon costumes, too—all golden filagree or
glittering scales—had a good innings, and anti-
cipated pantomime draperies, but not the least
amusing things were the society maidens sitting
on the shallow steps of the dais, like swagmen on
a kerbstone, with their knees doubled up to their
chins, gazing thoughtfully at the festive scene.
Some people would sit on the bare boards to be
in the magic circle of the vice-regal rendezvous,
but persons envious of social distinction shouldn’t
sit on the vice-regal step—it is so suggestive of
the step-up they’re yearning for.
By the way, I think the much-followed fashion
of fancy sets is about the best way to keep your
particular team in hand in the labyrinths of a big
public ball, that has been discovered up to date.
Not even the most assured outsider would take up
his position in a square to which the damsels in
whimsical attire were setting steadily in. Even if
a stray pair did wander that way the arrival of a
couple matching all the other couples standing
glowering upon them would make them flee from
the spot. Fancy sets are not always beautiful to
look upon, but they have one invariable virtue—
they always keep your “party” quite distinct
from the other people, and you can merrily dance
with one another all night long. In a society
seamed with little cliques this separate system of
dancing will continue wildly popular for aeons to
come.
A thing I notice at public balls and “ sich ” is
that when you round a corner and come plump on
Phyllis and Strephon it is nearly always a young
man who is caught red-handed, as it were. 1
suppose the moral is—do not “ sit out ” with any-
body under 40 (I am speaking to “ women only,”
of course), for the young man has not been
preying on society long enough to know the no-
thoroughfares of public buildings, and he sports
with Amaryllis, not in the shade, alas ! but under
a 40 horse-power electric glare, although there
may be an ocean of gloom and potted plants round
the next bend. I have never—emphatically never
—caught an oldster imprinting a salute upon
mademoiselle’s ear-lobes, or doing anything to
make the groundlings giggle as they pass. Mature
manhood doesn’t amuse itself to amuse the public,
too, but it doesn’t miss the fun of the fair either.
Therefore, O you many maidens who are prone to
being hugged by many adorers between the dances,
pause before you trust your sentimental fortunes
for the evening with a mere seedling Lothario !
The “Flowerland” Exhibition and Art Union
eventuated at Sydney Town Hall on the 28th ult.,
in the presence of a large slice of local fashion
with its best bonnet on. The Mayor of Sydney—
he of theLoNDON J ournal legs—opened the festival
with an exceedingly diplomatic speech, and then
the proceedings resolved themselves into an un-
equal sort of concert and everybody knew the
worst. Thirty works of art by “Flowerland” and
ten ibudents were plastered about the platform;
there were four stalls for photos, flowers, and so
on, mostly run by friendly Potts Pointers, and
the hall was decorated fore and aft with bunting
and greenery. In short, the festival was some-
thing like a musical “at home,” with prefatory
excuses made for it from the platform and price-
tags on the light refreshments. The concert
programme was strong. Madame Charbonnet-
Kellerman (in graceful mourning for M. Carnot)
Maude Heather Orlando Fitz-Stubbs,' Jessie
Middleton, Ed gar’cello Straus and others, all gave
their valuable services, but gloom had settled on
the audience and only a blast from the Last
Trump would have made the crowd-sit up.
As a show, “Flowerland” Festival was lady-
like and harmless enough, but I must rise and
object to the precedent. It was not a success,
however, and I don’t think any spectacle organised
by a more or less deserving person for her own
exclusive benefit would ever cub the purse-strings
of a discriminating Sydney public to any great
extent. If the world were in the habit of putting
a penny in the slob every time a fellow-creature
tooted his horn in an appealing key, every burst
boob in the land would charter the nearest barn,
corral the services of all the good-natured talent
in the vicinity, and run a one-night show for all the
small change there was in it.
Talking of benefits. The presentation to the
well-loved Mr. Alfred Dampier, of a cheque for
nearly £2OO and a handsome address, took place
at the Hotel Australia, last week. Mrs. Dampier
and her two daughters were present, in neat
serge gowns, and Mr. Dampier, in a Byronio
necktie, was visibly affected as the assemblage
drank his health in variously-split sodas. Mayor
Manning (by the way, the ballet needn’t trouble
to wink at his stage-box—he avowed, in a lovely
speech, that he had never been attracted show-
wards by the charms of the gold-washed chorus!)
did the presenting, and most of the flattery. I
liked the speeches, and I only objected to the
stress laid upon Mr. Dampier as a father. The
triumphant way they alluded to him in that
capacity looked as if it was a rare and original
thing to be a he-parent. Perhaps if Mr. Dampier
hadn’t been so devoted a parent—and husband—
he’d have been a bigger theatrical success. It is
a terrible handicap to firmly believe that one’s
ducks and ducklings are swans.
At the concert of Sydney Quintette Society,
sensation was lent to the classical bill by Madame
Kellermann and M. Poussard playing Beethoven’s
“Hero’’march as a tribute to M. Carnot—the
audience standing the while. The march had
been cleverly scored (considering it was done in 48
hours) for violin and piano (as the “ Moonlight’’
sonata and the “Kreutzer” had been arranged),
and everybody enjoyed listening to it —saving one
irrepressible newspaper lady. She tore behind
the screen, and her loud unabridged objections to
the introduction of the fiddle kept the front seaters
on the grin for the rest of the evening. It sounded
as if the soprano and the contralto were having it
out at last.
I have thankfully received a household cookery
by Mrs. H. J. Samuell, of Sydney. There are
many recipes—some for preparing sustenance in
the Jewish fashion, and I made myself quite
hungry reading it.
I learn that a Northerner who lately attained
his majority, and received about <£loo,ooo in hard
cash from his guardians and trustees, has been
frightened off to Japan—by the importunities of
the society-girls. According to an eminent Q. 0.,
one year in the Japanese tea-houses makes almost
any young man absolutely love-proof.
Yours affectionately, Sappho Smith.
Melbourne Confidences.
Melbourne, 3rd July.
The gilt-edged suburb of Hawthorn has been
enlivened by a double wedding. One of the
brides, a “Master of Science,” has committed an
intellectual mesalliance, her bridegroom boasting
only the inferior degree of B.S. But love makes
bold, and the maiden, having put her hand to the
plough, will not turn back. Romeo, who is an
albino, and has money, is, moreover, the holder of
a travelling scholarship, so his new owner intends
to bear him across the briny without loss of time.
Fostering his mental growth in some collegiate
nook, with bracing logic and mathematical tonic,
she hopes ultimately to raise him to her own level,
and behold him stamped with the M.S. brand.
The learned pair were nuptialed in academic
garb. The bride —a fresh, sensible-faced young
woman—looked no less attractive in cap and
gown than her younger sister in conventional
white silk and orange-blossom.
Western district was enlivened, the other day,
by the marriage of an undowered maiden to a
wealthy young squatter from another locality.
The bride was once ordered out of a ladies’ wait-
ing-room by a short-sighted railway employe who
mistook her for a man because she wore an ulster
and deerstalker cap and leaned her head against
her mother’s shoulder. The porter spread the
story of his idiotic error, and the victim awoke to
find herself famous. “Society” moralists made her
the text for disjointed sermons against divided
skirts and cigarette-smoking, neither of which
vices has anything to do with ulsters or felt hats
—or putting your head on your ma’s shoulder.
However, a squatter husband is consolation for
having one’s sex misinterpreted by a casual
observer.
Male visitors to the Austral Salon have a lovely
time, notwithstanding its rarefied atmosphere and
the intense mental culture of its members. In
fact, a noticeable feature of the meetings is that
wherever a man, married or single, may be, there
are the women gathered together.
A Melb. journal, regarded as the mouthpiece of
the cult, its editress being Highpriestess of the
“Temple of the Block,” vicariously flatters the
Salon’s pet politician, after this fashion : “ Mr.
Y.’s sister was there. She is very like her
brother, with the same clear features, bright eyes
and dark hair growing low on her forehead.”
How they do notice! And how awkward it
would be for a bald-headed man! Then, “Mr.
Y. is very properly adored by his family and by
the fair sex generally.” How’s that for incense?
Miss Aimee Moore, one of the Salon girls
(known to the sisterhood as “the Handmaiden”
from her devotion to the Highpriestess), is at
present in Sydney on the theatrical tack. She is
a rather pretty young woman of the slim and
meagre type, who, in dress and demeanour,
assumes a cross between Ophelia and Madge
Wildfire, her chief impersonations so far.
The Austral Salon sent out invitation cards for
Monday last, to commemorate—l had almost said
celebrate—the joint demises of Adam Lindsey
Gordon and Madame Lucy Chambers. It wasn’t
the date of the poet’s death, and the songstress
had only been buried a week or so, but as the
Salon, so it avers, exists to recognise talent, it
frantically grasps at every ghost of pretext. The
cards were chiefly noticeable for their funereal
appearance and want of grammar. The poet
rushed tragically out of life in a fit of despair!
and the event 1 is commemorated by a crowd of
women partaking of tea and tarts. Who says that
women aren’t humorists ?
An Orient liner brings back to our shores the
wife and child of Melbourne’s solitary Genius.
I hear from some compagnons de voyage that the
melancholy, so characteristic of the famous
“Idyll,” is faithfully reproduced in the weird
nocturnes of the infantile traveller. Heredity has
much to answer for.
History repeats itself, and the daughter of a
much-married Bendigo magnate has been led to
the altar by a widower with a young family. The
wise man guessed and calculated, no doubt, that
a wife who had herself experienced the changes
and chances of four stepmothers, would be a
sympathetic parent to his children. A pleasing
peculiarity of the paternal manage is that mothers-
in-law, past and present, are constant and welcome
guests, the climate apparently suiting themjbetter
than it agreed with the daughters gone before.
Melbourne, let me tell you, boasts of a well-
known professional man who has been married
thrice, and at a recent Govt. House ball people
were amused to see him handing in his three
mothers-in-law in succession to supper—especially
as he seemed to be on equally good terms
with the whole lot.
Ada Crossley arrived, with an ulcerated sore
throat, amid bleak, black weather, in London, in
the first week in May; but her prospects were
too bright to be dimmed by trifles. She writes to
a friend that she immediately set off in quest of
new clothes. She took 10 trunks of elaborate
clothing, parting gifts from admiring friends, so her
desire for more would seem to be mere exuberance
of spirits. She took also 96 letters of introduc-
tion, and books and musio enough to fill her com-
partment of the train when it left Spencer-st.,
Melb. But, apart from her magnificent voice, she
deserved all she got—she has worked hard, and
in the height of her success was never ashamed ol
either her poor beginnings or belongings.
Some friends of mine were at a big dinner in
London lately, and two ladies next them were dis-
cussing singers. “I admire Albani’s singing,”
said one, “but I like that Australian—l forget
her name—much better.” “So do I,” replied the
other, “bub I cannot think of it, either; I believe
it begins with ‘M.’” “Oh, now I remember,”
said the first speaker, “Orleans.”
Basso Magrath, of Belle Cole’s Co., was, while
in Melb., much admired by womankind, by reason
of his good looks, fine voice, and delightful Hiber-
nian humour. Mr. Magrath, however, is a Bene-
dict, and his wife (who, by the way, is a Victorian
native) is, during her husband’s absence, residing
in Ireland. Spada only the other day lost her
mother, while the Murkens’ husband (who resides
in Deutschland) is reported to be dying. Conse-
quently, the last Melb. appearance of these artists
were made under circumstances of sorrow.
All the Australian Governors read The Bulle-
tin, but Gov. Robinson is the only one who openly
delights in it. This story, told by himself, hangs
on a Bulletin par. Some time ago, he published
a song called “Remember Me No More,” which
The Bulletin said it couldn’t do. Recently an
opera co. performed in Perth, and one of the
vocalists, as a compliment, interpolated the song.
She was supposed to be clad in one of those
costumes that are slit up the side of the skirt to a
certain extent —sufficient to display a decorous
amount of limb. But the skirt of this lady, all
unknown to herself, was slit up a great deal too
far, so that on one side she unconsciously displayed
a pair of funny little blue-cloth trunks. Gov.
William says that as he looked at her and heard
her singing the refrain, “Remember me no more,”
he couldn’t help thinking of that Bulletin par.,
and said to himself, “ Can’t do it, Dora 1”
A festive item of the “Helping Hands” pro-
gramme (the H.H. being a strolling company of
charitable amateurs under command of the L. L.
Lewises) is the skirt-dancing of the Misses Hors-
fall, sister of Mrs. Rupert Carington. The
younger one, decidedly picturesque in white
muslin and pink silk, her face framed in a fluffy
cloud of dark hair, manipulates her skirts after
the most approved stage method. These damsels
visit the theatre solely to obtain Terpsichorean
wrinkles, and only the other night they were in a
box at the Princess, their eyes glued to the ballet.
A frisky matron, sick and sorry of compli-
mentary mourning and rural exile, is once more to
be seen in our midst. Perhaps the farewelling of
a stage lady killer hastened this return, the lady’s
devotion to opera being notorious; yet what might,
at one time, have been a fwrench, was borne with
apparent equanimity. ’Tis said, our sex dresses,
not to please the men, but to spite other women.
On something the same principle, perhaps, the fair
patroness’s tactics seemed designed to ostenta-
tiously welcome the coming , rather than to speed
the parting guest.
The announcement of a Williamstown girl’s en*
gagement recalls an elder sister’s matrimonial
triumph, which raised the whole dan from com-
parative obscurity. The fair victrix of yore,
while on a Northern visit, hung so reverentially
on the sayings of a middle-aged gold mountaineer
that he succumbed on the spot, and his slice of
the golden mount became a joint property in less
than no time.
The guests at a gorgeous wedding-breakfast,
who overflowed four rooms at Menzies’ recently,
were “ shadowed ”by private detectives. These
gentry, though incognito, brought a distinct im-
pression of spectre bridegroom into the affair, and
speculation concerning their business on this joy-
ful day has been rife.
At Carlton, lately, Mr. Isaacs charmed the ears
of female suffragists, and won a smile from his
pretty wife with the statement, that “from the
cradle to the grave, existence without the dear
creatures would be unbearable. ” He had hardly
finished, when a callow youth bounded on the
platform to reiterate the dreary chestnut that
women were best employed in guarding the baby.
Then an ancient stepped into the breach with the
brilliant suggestion that “all ladies ’adn’t orf-
springs to mind,” and the callow youth, rendered
reckless by excitement, said—“ Well, they ought
to 1” Which was rather embarrassing for the un-
married delinquents.
A certai i Victorian damsel is commiserated
for the supposed disappointment of her
father’s will. The document, I’m told, was
never intended to do more, so far as she
was concerned, than endow her with a handsome
home —house, grounds, live-stock and ready cash
thrown in—as by her late mother’s marriage-settle-
ment of .£50,000 (besides accumulated interest) she
was already provided for.
A parcel of new music from Ricordi and Co.,
the Italian music-sellers in London, includes a
pretty “ Harem ” waltz by Bucalossi (with a
rather giddy frontispiece), and at least one
catchy Tosti song, called “Sorridimi” (Smile on
me). The words of this love-lorn ditty are a
translation from an Italian bard, and will suit any
passionate tenor who meditates doing another
mash. Another intensely Italian ballad is turned
into “Only to Dream you Love me”—music by
Francesco Quaranta. In this case eight lines of
warm verse are spread over a full allowance of
warm music on the anthem principle.
VAN M.
At Poverty Point.
There is a touch of unintentional humour in th«
sombreneas of “ After Dark." It is where the fatally-
beautiful Scot Inglis, as Gordon Chumley, meets his
former fellow officer, drunk, tattered, grey, bald, dirty,
and utterly stone-broke, carrying a sandwich-board, and
filling in his spare time by trawling for suicides in the
Thames, and after weeping over him and talking of
bygone times gives him—of all things on this earth—his
card. Then, for the first time in many drink-sodden
years, the other man realises the full measure of bis
degradation, and he puts the pasteboard aside wilh his
palsied hands because he feels he isn’t worthy, where-
upon his friend clasps him in his arms, and begs him
almost with tears to take his card. Finally the hungry
wretch takes the card and shuffles feebly away with a
determination to reform. The card has awakened him to
a desire for better things. It is a blessed thing, when a
man is hopelessly wrecked in this stony world, to meet a
sympathising friend who will give him his card.
Belle Cole & Co. compared their Melbourne support in
oratorio with the Sydney ditto, much to the former’s dis-
advantage. The Age critic, on “Elijah," said—“ Con-
cerning the orchestra there is no need to say anything at
all, save to express regret that artists visiting Melbourne
should be subjected to the*infliction,” &c.
_ Melb. Lyric Club lost the major portion of its “ influen-
tial following" when Ethel Haydon seceded, and the
sporting friends of her papa withdrew their patronage.
It was pitiable to see poor old Nellie Farren carried in
an invalid-chair to Irving’s box, at the Lyceum, one even-
ing lately, to sample “ Faust.” However, barring being
crippled, says a correspondent, Cinder Ellen did not look
much the worse for wear.
It is said in London, remarks The Bulletin’s corres-
pondent, that Mrs. Langtry absolutely cried when she
went off the stage after her cool reception in “ A Society
Butterfly.” Fancy the Lily in tears! But what else
could she expect? When it was announced that she
would appear in one of the tableaux as Lady Godiva, the
public could not stand being put off with a figure in a
high-necked frock. The Lily must learn to live up to,
and dress up to, her reputation.
Di Bloustein, who played Pauline in “The Lady of
Lyons” for her benefit at Melb. Alexandra, sometime
ago, is now with the Bland Holt Co. at Sydney Lyceum
under the stage-name of Adelaide Hope.
Cartwright, it is understood, was responsible for engag'
ing and sending Miss Dudley to Australia.
Dan Barry, who contemplates a season at Sydney Royal,
is having “ the wind taken out of his sails ” by Rignold,
who is rapidly producing pieces to which Dan has
“ pinned his faith ” for years.
Lonnen, writes The Bulletin’s London correspondent,
is quite eclipsed by Sheridan in “Little Christopher
Columbus.” As the detective Hooligan, Lonnen, of
course, has to assume a brogue, which went down well
enough with those who are not judges until Sheridan
came along with the “rale” article. “Columbus” still
draws marvellously, but more owing to May Yoh6’s two
songs—“ Lazily, Lazily” and “Oh, Honey, my Honey,”
which are always rapturously received. There are people
who go night after night to hear her. Yet she has a most
peculiar voice, which can only be described to that of a
very well-taught raven.
Bill Holloway has taken Terry’s Theatre, London.
Vanity of vanities I
Tub Bulletin regrets to notice the bankruptcy of Mr.
Arthur Garner, theatrical manager—liabilities, £52,970 ;
Assets, £54,687. A few years ago Mr. Garner retired from
business a rich man, but he has come down in the common
crash.
“Jack” Holloway, the only son of Plain Bill, has gone
to France to learn the lingo, prior to studying law. He
leaves the stage to his sisters, Julie and Thea.
All Marshall Hall’s malignity against the critics arose
through one of that ilk having made a venomous attack,
not on his music, but on a favourite though ferocious dog
during the days of his early “ colonial ” residence. He
then lived at the quiet, boom-born suburb of Moreland,
and until his dog was poisoned he was quite kindly dis-
posed towards everybody—even the critics. He resented
the outrage on his canine friend by leaving the suburb
where the dog had caused a reign of terror, and removed
to the domicile sacred to the memory of Hamilton Clark—
which latter abode proved equally uncongenial.
Signorina Orelli, as Oasilda, was the real success of
“The Gondoliers” amateur show by Melbourne Opera
Club. She is the youngest girl of the company, has the
easiest stage manner, and certainly the best voice of them
all. With a more becoming costume she would have been
unanimously voted superior to Florence Young, as
Florence was when she first attempted the same char-
acter at the Princess’. Miss Orelli is to “come out” in
opera presently, they say, and, what’s more, she is calcu-
lated to remain out when she gets there.
When is “Haddon Hall” to be produced in Australia?
The “ firm " promised it before their last Melb. season,
but now it seems as far off as ever.
What with Sass’ attempt to complete the marriage-
contract, in the “Life of Pleasure," and the tropical
scene between the King of France and the virtuous
heroine in a nightdress, Balfour and the W.C.T. Union will
soon be bringing in a bill to suppress the Princess
Theatre altogether, and strew the site with salt.
A younger son of playwright Tom Robertson was con-
victed of reckless fraud, the other week, and sent to
Melbourne Gaol. Latest London papers report that
T. W. Robertson, the eldest son of clever “Tom,” lay
dying of brain-paralysis. Insanity and crime are brothers,
and genius is often their father. Tom Robertson’s chil-
dren were born in his struggling Bohemian days, before
the Bancrofts had produced “Society,” and put him on
the road to his short-lived prosperity.
Miss Fortescue is "towering” with “Hypatia,” the
provincial rights to which she has purchased. Her
devoted Vanderfeldt is nothin the caste, and the part of
Issachar (says The Bulletin’s correspondent) is played
by Murray Carson, who (if it is not treason to say so)
realises the character, both in looks and acting, much
better than Beerbohm Tree. Vanderfeldt is under engage-
ment (theatrically) to Miss Fortescue for several years,
and he has been loaned during the tour of “Hypatia.”
He is still as spoony and devoted as ever to the rejected
of Gumboil.
The sawdusty bloom cannot be wafted over the foot-
lights—is the dictum of Fitzgerald Bros.
Madame Duse returns to London, with a new and
inferior leading man. The other was talked about. She
“is separated from her husband, but not for her fault,
and is strict as Mary Anderson.”
The Naval Brigade sends a contingent, in Her Maj.’s
uniform, to play in “My Jack,” at the Melb. Royal.
When “ Youth ” was produced at that house the obliging
commandant lent a lot of Martini-Henrys, and there was
more row than enough over the thing.
Many weird stories of stranded theatrical oo.’s are heard
up North (writes a correspondent), and one not infre-
quently has one’s shaving-water deposited at the door of
his room at the hotel by an ex-member of the profession
who has had the luck to get a billet as housemaid.
Pollard’s Lilliputians, after breaking the record in
Charters Towers (the best show town in Queensland) is
working back South —a poor game. Bentley formerly held
the Towers record with £l2OO clear for 10 nights; Pollards
are credited with something over £2OOO.
Despite Mrs. Pat Campbell’s comparative failure (writes
The Bulletin’s London correspondent), the bookings for
“ The Masqueraders ” exceed anything in the history of
the St. James’ theatre.
Pretty Hilda Spong avers that she is 20 years of age.
Burly “ Bill” Rignold is now playing his original (1874)
part of Jacques in “Two Orphans,” at London Adelphi.
Marion Terry reappears as Louise, after a lapse of 16
years, and the lame Pierre is our rather noisy old friend
Charles Cartwright.
Touching Mrs. Ruppert’s bid for dramatic fame on the
strength of her nostrum notoriety, the Referee says:
“If Messrs. Spiers and Pond appeared on the stage as
‘The Two Gentlemen of Verona,'it would be as actors,
and actors only, that they would claim attention." One
of them, The Bulletin assumes, would claim attention as
a ghost. Christopher Pond died years ago.
Kate Vaughan has not been a success in “ King Kodak,”
and (the late) Sylvia Grey has been engaged to take her
part. The public are loyal, but they can't stand old
favourites who have ceased to amuse. Kate,'however,
has the excuse of domestic troubles, for, on dit, Wellesley
behaves very badly to her. The old, old story.
Miss Annis Montague (Mrs. Charles Turner) will, on her
return from M.L., open a school of music and singing in
Melb. The talented lady taught Prances Saville, Edith
Moore, Tom Gordon, Cecily Staunton, and some 14 or 16
others. Although she did not bring Melba “ right out”
—for Cecchi was the diva’s tutor proper—she taught her
several very useful “wrinkles” which Melba has not for-
gotten to acknowledge.

It is not easy to realise that Toby Barton, ;
who now weighs 19st. or thereabouts, once rowed i
in Sydney University eight at 9st. 71b.
About the hardest thing said about poor
Bray, late S.A. Agent-General, was Downer’s
remark; “We shared jour pleasures and our joys
together.”
Murderer Bertrand left all his paintings
and nic-nacs behind him in Darlinghurst Gaol-
being unwilling to take away any memories of his
long prison life.
Vic. Attorney-General Bryan O’Loghlen
has never been known to make a joke or put a
spark of humour into a speech. What’s more, he
couldn’t if he tried.
Ex-sculler Trickett mounts guard at the
Moama Customs end of the Murray bridge. He

of the most aggravated type.
Three S.A. Speakers are dead. Of these
two—Kingston and Bray—passed away at sea,
while the third (Ross) is believed by some to have
committed suicide in a fit of depression.
Parkes was recently presented by the

“Charlie” Smith, who was succeeded in

The English “ royal ” family now consists

The Calvinistic world will bracket Carnot’s
assassination going to the theatre on Sunday, with
Lincoln’s, at the theatre on Good Friday. But
glorious Waterloo was fought on the blessed

M‘llwraith, many people will regret to
hear, is suffering from dropsy. Last week Jimmy
Tyson walked out to see him but was denied ad-
mission to the sick room. Tyson is deeply con-
cerned about the ex-Premier’s health.
C. A. Wittenbach, the clever Melbourne
journalist, drowned in the River Winnipeg,
Canada, was for seven years law-reporter of Melb.
Age. His disappearance from Melbourne was
mysterious. One night sub-editor Stephens won-
dered why the law-copy hadn’t arrived. Next
morning Wittenbach didn’t turn up and a message
was sent to his house. He hadn’t been there since
the previous morning. A year rolled by and
nothing was heard of him till news of his death
came from Canada. Wittenbach, who was of
German parentage, was one of the most amiable
and best-loved men on the Southern press.
H. H. Champion is
now back in Melbourne
from London, and is
writing leaders for the
Age.
The Bulletin was
always under the im-
pression that; “ The
Jaynial ” Dan O’Con-
nor was an Australian
native. But he is a
Tipperary man, and
just 50 years of age.
G. Y. Brooke’s
black valet, a much-
travelled man, and
quite the “ swell” when

ing as a fish-hawker at
Meredith (Vic.) He is
about the only notable
person in that unexcit-
ing district.
The success of the
present attempt by the
Sydney daily press to
“boost” Parkeswould,
of course, involve the
political death of his
friend, Opposition
leader Reid. In ack-
nowledging some
pumped-up bucolic en-
thusiasmson his country
tour, the old man said
his bodily health was
“ as good as it had been
any time for the last 12
or 15 years.” Yet it is
by no means 12 or 15
years since he said —‘I
stand in the light of the
gravenorisit 120r15
years since he boasted
at Bathurst that he
was the sort of man
who lived 120 years and sired children as a cen
tenarian.
Mrs. Maningfcon Oaffyn’s new novel is

which was not altogether the case with A f ellow
able heroine in her struggles with bad fortune in
those days.
That man of vim, Pastor Isitt, had £275
a year as a Wesleyan parson in Maoriland. His
income as a pump-priest is much heavier. At
Napier he made .£4O in a week’s lecturing, and his
Sydney profits must have far exceeded that figure.
Howard “ Timotheus ” Willoughby is
Melb. correspondent for London Times. One can
easily understand, then, why the latter should
publish a gushsome article on the former. But
why pay 3s. lOd. a word for cabling what could
have been procured in the office ?
Mrs. Charles Meredith, the veteran Tas-
manian authoress, is back in Melbourne after her
late trip to England. At some years over 80 she is
as sprightly as ever, and is now actively engaged
upon a new book, her originality and productive-
ness being by no means worn out.
There still lives in Daylesford (Vic.) Evan
Jones, a bronzed naval veteran, who was awarded
a medal for saving life at the wreck of H.M.S.
London in ’39. Two years ago he married a
young wife who lately presented her lord with
what Parkes calls “a couple of sweet souvenirs
of wedded affection.”
Wasn’t the real name of “ Curtayne,” the
Melb, bank-manager, Curtin? Anyhow, the
man of that name whose murder by an Irish
secret society some years ago attracted so much
attention, had a brother said to be manager of a
Melb. bank. In America the Murphys when they
rise in the world mostly become Morphys.
Yic. Chief Justice Madden, gorgeous in
his astraehan-trimraed coat, was seen in George-st. ‘
Sydney, last week, talking about old times to the
managing-clerk of the Melb. firm of attorneys who
instructed him in the big divorce-case, Malpas v.
Malpas, 10 years ago. And yet there is no very
big “mill” announced in Sydney just now.
From London correspondent of S.A-
Advertiser :
When the first cablegram appeared saying that Play-
ford had been appointed S.A. Agent-General, poor Bray
let his paper fall and said—“ Cruel, unkind.” Nearly
the whole of the rest of the day he kept his eyes on the
paper, and his thumb was placed just below the telegram.
Of the many influences which moved the
Australian-born Bishop Green into the episcopacy
of Grafton and Armidale, N.S.W., it is under-
stood that not the least active was that of those
who were prepared to go bail that the young man
would stand up for the traditions of the “ grand
old church.” He is doing it. All native Austra-
lians want are the back seats when Englishmen
are about.
Poor old Tawhaio, the Maori King, now
spends much time in selecting temporary wives
from the bevy of fat and pleasing wahinc that
attend upon royalty. When not engaged in being
married, he concocts “royal proclamations,”
which he issues from his own special printing-
press. These proclamations cover pretty nearly
everything, from an ordinance upon straying pigs
to dissertations upon life in the next world. His
last proclamation was one forbidding any Maori
girl to wed a pakeha husband.
In February last Charles Gavan Duffy
celebrated the jubilee of his trial with O’Connell
and others at Dublin for “sedition.” This time
50 years ago Duffy was “ doing time ” as a result
of the trial. Duffy is the sole survivor of the
eight accused. The eleven counsel who prose-
cuted for the Crown and the sixteen barristers
who appeared for the defendants — likewise the
A RISING PHILANTHROPIST.
LANDLORD: “Madam, I have come to inform you that I have raised your
rent.”
TENANT: “Oh, heaven bless you! I have been wondering day and night
for a whole week how I could raise it myself!
three judges who tried the case—are all dead.
The weakly-looking Duffy survives every one who
was concerned in that trial unless it be that a
juryman or two still lives.
The Ministerial head of one Australian
railway department is cordially hated by every
officer from the Commissioner to the engine-
cleaner. Even his own colleagues will not speak
to him unless compelled. On one occasion, throw-
ing round a roll of papers, he remarked to the
head of a department, “ See to this matter, or”
here he lifted and swung his foot suggestively.
Another time when new lines were under discus-
sion, he remarked to the assembled engineers and
surveyors: ** Pooh ! my wife could do all tho
engineering required on this line, and my old gar-
dener all the surveying.”
George Louis A. Davies, formerly hon.
sec. of the N.S.W. Farmers’ Association, and now
secretary of the N.S.W, Press Association, one of
the dozen or so Parliamentary candidates for
Willoughby (N.S.W.), is a printer by trade, and
was the first man to establish a penny newspaper
in Sydney. It was a semi-weekly, and proved
snob a success as to cause moneyed imitators to
establish the daily Evening News, which knocked
the semi-weekly out.
An old Lachlan River paafcoralisfc, beloved
for his fairness to station-hands and his kindness
to swagmen, absolutely abhors the sound of cattle-
bells or the ticking of a watch. He has been
known to get up in the middle of the night, saddle
a horse and yard teamsters’ bullocks to take off
their bells; and would run, on foot, half a night
after a horse, through the scrub, for the same pur-
pose. The old man hangs his watch carefully

on the fence outside his house before retiring to
bed. On one occasion, when staying wi th a neigh-
bouring squatter, a watch was, by mistake, left
in his bedroom. Next morning “ mine host
found his guest camping near a fire half-a-mile
from the homestead. Yet the same man keeps
net snakes about the house, and can sleep peace-
fully alongside a shed full of drafted ewes and
lambs !
A Bulletin correspondent quaintly gossips
about Isaac Pitman :
I was a pupil of Isaac Pitman at Wotton Underedge in
Gloucestershire (Eng.) in 1836. He then taught us short-
hand on a black-board. He was a tall man and parted
his hair in the middle. He was full of energy and walked
at the rate of five or six miles an hour. He was very
much liked hy his pupils—he gave them lots of outdoor
exercise, ami was in the habit of taking bags of apples to
the top of Wotton Hill and rolling them down for the
boys to scramble after. His school was in the first flat of
an empty cloth-mill; his brothers Benjamin and Henry
helped him in the school. Mrs. Pitman devoted a lot of
her time to teaching poor people to make soup and to
making the best use of the food they had.
Sophia, the well-known Maori guide at
Rotorua, who took the Governor and party around
the other day, complains that, although Glasgie
expressed his approval” of her intelligence, he
didn’t part a cent. There was once a Scotch
Governor of Fiji, who, having been informed that
it was necessary for him to make a slight return
to some big Viti Levu chiefs who had sent him a
handsome present, replied that he believed in
making a return present of equivalent value, and
sent them six tins of pressed mutton, a broken
breakfast-set, and an axe-handle. There was also
once aN.S.W. Governor who, while_ visiting the
Northern rivers, met an old aboriginal identity
who claimed local kingship. “How much ought
we to give him?” enquired His Ex. of the Mayor.
: Oh, say five shillings,” replied the Mayor.
After a confab with his suite, the Governor sub-
sidised His ]Vla»j£sty to the extent of kikpen .
Dear Bulletin, —It’s not at all certain, as
you seem |to suppose, that Victoria’s Chief Com-
missioner of Police will be replaced by a ranker
to wit, Superintendent Thomas I arkinson, of
Ballarat. He has fairly earned the position, but
will have to fight for it with Fire-low Price,
Evans (Inspector-General of Prisons), and several
others who are in the field. Parkinson s would
undoubtedly be the most popular appointment,
and if experience counts for anything, the best.
The difficulty, however, is likely to be postponed
by the retention of Mr. Chomley for a further
term. That step would be most favourably re-
ceived of any, as the silver-headed old Chief is
idolised by the “Foorce,” appreciated by the
powers, and trusted by the public. Just, generous,
courteous, capable, handsome, and humane!
That’s Chomley, and long may he reign !—Yours,
Cop.
A shark, 15ffc. long, and weighing a ton,
has been captured and landed at Kiama (N.o. VV.).
This is the shark that swallowed Jonah. A portion
of that prophet’s camel’s-hair girdle was found, in
a remarkable state of preservation, in the monster s
stomach. .
Premier Kingston is much annoyed with
Speaker Coles because he believes it was through
his betrayal of Play ford’s confidence that all the
details about Agent-General Bray’s illness were
made public property. As a matter of fact, how-
ever, Playford, freed from restraint because of
Kingston’s absence in Westralia, babbled about
the matter to everyone he met, being quite unable
to contain his joy at the prospect of grabbing the
vacant billet of Agent-General with its <£lsoo a
year.
Minister Frank Suttor, of N.S.W., was
born to be a knight; and is now “right on the
job.” Cable; —
Hon. F. B. Suttor, the delegate for New South Wales,
proposed the adoption of an address to" the Queen con-
gratulating her Majesty upon the 57th anniversary of her
coronation. In his remarks he laid special stress upon the
vast growth of the colonies during her Majesty’s reign.
The address was adopted. The members of the Conference
sang the National Anthem, and the spectators joined in.
How very transparent!
The Age reflects cynic-
ally on the fact that Book
Arcade Cole labels a pile of
copies of “ Miss Milne and I,”
as by the husband (Dr. Caf-
fyn) of the author of the
“Yellow Aster.’’ Whenwifey
get her rights hubby gets left.
The S.M. Herald one
day recently gravely informed
its readers that Mr. W. W.
Tarleton had been admitted
to practise at the Norfolk
Island Bar. We may be told
next that Purves, Q.C., has
found his way to the Bar of
Kangaroo Island.
Mr. James Brown Pat-
terson says that he didn’t want
a knighthood, and he regards
it solely as a compliment to
the province of Victoria. The
Bulletin hasn’t yet met with
onesolitary knight who wanted
his kirghthood, but they all
took it none the less. A title
is about the only thing that
everybody will take against
his will. Anything else that
a man doesn’t want, such as
a kick, or a piece of tainted
meat, or a glass of beer with a
dead fly in it, he will promptly
refuse, but he always grabs at
the title with extreme reluc-
tance, and seizes it desperately
with both hands. Then he
explains that he took it to
please his wife, or his Queen,
or his country, or his dog, or
something equally irrelevant.
This paper wants to hear of
one honest K.C.M.G. who
will say straight out that he 8
glad of the title for his own
sake, and that anybody who
tries to take it from him will
be killed in the struggle.
The Wilberforce (N.S.W.) co-operative
settlement has been split in halves—one to be
worked on socialist, the other on individualistic
lines.
The Bulletin has just discovered some-
thing, A correspondent:—
Now that N.S.W. Parliament has collapsed, the refresh-
ment-room committee should devote some attention to
the mysterious grog-bills of certain members. Legis-
lators, for years past, have shown a marvellous reluctance
to pay their scores. A member would invite half-a-dozen,
or so, of his constituents into one of the smoking-
rooms and ring for the waiter. On the grog being handed
round the cowed and courteous flunkey would pause
for cash or “instructions.” He almost invariably
received the latter, which amounted to a quiet request to
“ Put them down to .” And the waiter would
reply with meekness and assumed innocence, “Very well,
sir.” And accordingly the grog was scored—“ Sir -— ,
, per Mr. Jones-Brown, M.P., six drinks.” A
reference to the score-book reveals a colossal and ruinous
bill against for drinks for which he never will
account—and never should. This little frivolity has
found most favour among Protectionist and anti—
members of the Assembly. The obedience of the waiters
is the essence of the playful imposition upon the credit of
the political Patriarch.
Said correspondent is standing for Parliament
himself, and if he has any luck, as The Bulletin
trusts he will, he intends, next session, to have his
drinks also put down to Sir Blank.
Neuralgia
is the first, surest and most reliable sign of nerve
decay; it is a symptom provided by nature to
warn the sufferer of approaching weakness and
distress, though in most cases the pain is purely
local; the disease is constitutional, and local
remedies, such as liniments, oils and menthol,
only give temporary relief and do not do the
slightest permanent good, for they only act by
deadening the sensibility of the affected nerve.
The remedy, to be of any lasting benefit, must be
tissue forming and nerve strengthening and must
have general invigorating properties ; it must also
contain the material to restore the lost tissue to
the impoverished nerves, and no remedy except
Clements Tonic possesses these wonderful powers.
Clements Tonic has been used for thousands of
cases by young and old of both sexes for neuralgia,
sciatica, and other nervous complaints, and we
have never heard of a case where it has failed to
give quick and prompt relief. Head the case of
Mr. W, H. Stigings, 8 Bute-ter., Newtown, who
writes ori December 20, 1892; —Having for a long
time been suffering from nervousness and languid
feeling, also frequent dizziness, I had been under
medical advice, but not deriving any benefit
therefrom was advised to try Clements Tonic.
I did so, and after taking four bottles I can say
conscientiously that it performed a thorough cure.
I have none of the old symptoms from which I
suffered for the last eight months, I therefore
recommend it to everybody.—l remain, yours,
etc., W. H. Stigings, 8 Bute Terrace, Newtown,
Sydney.

“ Cease, viper, you bite a file ! ” was
Carter’s enraged response to some recent Shiels

Where is Premier Dibbs’ Sinking-fund
vanished to? Apparently it has gone where
Mount Huxley went, and where all the other
dead things go. Nobody ever hears of the great
scheme now.
A couple of N.S.W. political anomalies.
Freehill, a Protectionist candidate for one elec-
torate, signs a requisition inviting M'Millan to
stand in the Freetrade interest for another elec-
torate; and H. H. Cooke, a Freetrade candidate
for Condobolin, signs a requisition inviting Stokes,
a Protectionist candidate, to stand for Ashburn-
ham.
The only ground
on which death-duties
can be honestly de-
manded is as a return
for the protection and
safety afforded to the
dutiable property by
the laws, &c., of the
country imposing the
tax. Yet England
impudently claims to
make property here
contribute to make
good her Budget defi-
cit—and this deficit
has mostly sprung out
of military expendi-
ture from which we get
no benefit whatever.
Parkes is never
more garrulously pla-
titudinous than when,
as at the Mayor of
Sydney’s spread the
other day, he des-
cribeslmunicipal coun-
cils as the true and
perfect training-
ground tor the floor
of Parliament How
many eminent parlia-
mentarians have been
aldermen? How
many of the least use-
ful members of every
Parliament have gra-
duated through muni-
cipal councils? Is not
the development of
the aldermanic mind
destructive of parlia-
mentary breadth and
national sympathy ?
Take England; take
Australia ; or take
Parkes’ own little
corner of this latter
country. Did he, or
Dibbs, or M ‘Mil lan,
or Bruce Smith, or
any other man who
has made a big mark,
avail himself of _ a
borough council train-
ing-ground ? On the
other hand, pick out
the aldermen in the
last, or in any Par-
liament, and ask, not
what did they do,
but what can such
creatures ever do ?
While the Dibbs Govt, knocked £2 a-year
off the “ screw ” of the messenger at the Treasury,
the leader of the retrenchment party, though a
private member, was drawing ,£lOOO a-year from
the same Treasury.
Benjamin Short, parliamentary aspirant,
says that “the Creator of the Universe is a free-
trader.” Is Short a Christian? If so, does not
the Christian Book tell us that Jehovah had a
“peculiar people,” a “chosen seed,” and was
therefore an out-and-out protectionist ?
Sydney Telegraph yells that “ the Dibbs
Ministry thrust nearly £1,000,000 of additional
taxation on the backs and the stomachs of the
masses.” According to Ooghlan, however, who
possibly knows somethin# about it, the difference
between the taxes levied on the backs ana
Stomachs of the masses during the last year or the
Dibbs Ministry and the last of the Parkes Ministry
is only about ,£40,000.
So far as The Bulletin has been able to
discover, about 85 per cent, of the N.fe.W. Parlia-
mentary candidates were born in Brummagem,
Or thereabouts, and of these 78 per cent, have nob

Tozer emphatically denies that M’llwraith

Dibbs’s proposal to arbitrate between the
pastoralists and shearers with a view to ending
their differences by conference, created more ill-
will towards him in Sydney mercantile circles
last week than all his declarations about loading
the tariff.
Prof. Morris, of Melbourne, suggests
(“ after ” an old Bulletin picture) that every
speaker, speaking in public, should have a rope
round his neck, and be summarily strung up if he
offered to orate for more than an hour. Well, men
have been hanged for less.
Sydney E. News is a “ Freetrade ” paper.
Yet” Sydney E. News is managed by Mr. Alfred
Bennett, proprietor of extensive sugar-works in
Northern N.S.W. which’enjoy the full benefit of
the <£6 ss. per ton sugar-duty imposed by the
“great N.S.W. Freetrade party.”
Should G. H. Reid form a Cabinet, it is
understood that he \yill be smart enough to ask
Varney Parkes to join —assuming that V.P. suc-
ceeds in getting a Parliamentary seat. Old man
Parkes wants it recorded in history that both he
and his son were Ministers of the Crown.
“ What is the use,” asked a hairy-faced
Parliamentary candidate, nervously pacing the
floor of a Sydney newspaper office, the other day,
with his hands in his trousers pocket, > “ of my
owning so many shares in this paper if I m to be
treated merely on my merits ? What’s the use.
Akgus on royalty ; “ All the freedom that
can be considered either desirable cr necessary for
the British people is already secured.” Freedom,
like that other much-lauded spirit, whisky, is a
good thing—in moderation. “When anything is
asked for, ‘it is too much;’ when anything is
granted —‘ it is enough.’ ”
N.S.W. Executive hasdecided that the prefix
“ hon.” is not to be used in future when address-
ing official communications to a Minister of the
Crown. When the present Ministers again adorn
their respective departments, they will therefore
be addressed as —“ Damn-Chicago Dibbs, Gim-
me-my-bunk Copeland,” &0., &e.
Chief Justice Way (5.A..) won’t thank

Argues the Sydney D.T. :
The popularity of the Freetrade cause to-day is con-
clusively demonstrated by the fact that in the 125 con-
stituencies there are 257 candidates in that interest,
against 189 Protectionist aspirants.
Palpable non sequitur / If the plethora of Free-
trade candidates proves anything, it proves “ the
popularity of” .£3OO a year. It also affords a
good argument as to the mediocrity of the Free-
trade aspirants.
“Honest” Tom Playford, S.A. Agent-
General, as befitted a practical ex-pumpkin-
grower, seems to have been the only delegate at
the Ottawa Conference who talked common-sense.
Fancy hears the pudding-faced burly man
throatily exclaiming—“ The purpuss of tins yere
Conference is to advarnce trade between the
dependencies, and not to deal with matters ot
mere sentiment.”
“ Elections aren’t now what they used to
be ” remarked a reminiscent Sydney produce-
dealer one day last week. “ I haven’t got a single
order for a case of stale eggs yet. I mind the tune
I stood for up-country—that was before 1 went
into the produce business —the whole electorate
smelled of bad eggs. Candidates now-a-days don t
need money, don’t need reputation, and don t need
nerve. And you call that advancement?”
Gangs of time-expired N.Q. Kanakas are
combining to cut cane by contract, and pay white
men a percentage on their contracts to nominally
represent them as contractors. The Kanakas up
North also lease farms, to which Northern capi-
talists strongly object, ostensibly because these
farms are hot-beds of vice; in reality, however,
because these leaseholds make the Kanaka in-
dependent of the planter and enable him to
demand a decent living wage.

It’s offspring, the Labour Electoral Leagues,

Freetraders go regularly to the shrine of
Parkes, and twirling a sheet of paper between
finger and thumb complain of the insolent
familiarity of Reid. The old man wags his head
but gives them nothing they can quote. If, now,
some of these irate interviewers could but mount
a public platform and wag their heads just as
Parkes does, giving at the same time an accurate
account of the complaints made, there would be
renewed friction among the heads of the party.
“Jack” Murray, member for Warrnam-
bool, was the only Vic. M.P. who ventured to
sneer at the loyal ecstacies of J. Brown-Patterson
re the birth of “ the future king of England.’
Whilst he lamented, with mock seriousness, the
fact that the child, in not being born in Australia,
had missed the honour of being the godson of
J.8.P., Speaker Bent spluttered in positive
anguish, and the other members looked as if
expecting a thunderbolt from God to strike dead
the man who dared be other than crawlsome in
speaking of a baby prince.
“ The Samoan Commission,” says the
Samoa Herald, “ has now restored hundreds of
thousands of acres of land to natives, from whom
it had been taken under claims set up by
foreigners. An idea of the grasping disposition
of foreigners may be gathered from the fact that
the land claimed by them amounted to 2,000,000
acres, while the total amount of land in the whole
group is only 900,000 acres. About 200,000 acres
will be decided in favour of foreign claimants,
and 700,000 will go back to the natives.”
“ We may well pray, ‘ Lord, forgive us our trespasses,’
for it’s no good asking God to forgive our blunders.

The appointment of a Tuesday in place of
a Saturday as the day on which N.S.W. general
elections are to be held, is not likely to rob many
workers of their chances to vote. But it is calcu-
lated to arouse their resentment, and to inflame
their determination to vote no matter at what
hazard. Further, the infliction by an employer of
any sort of punishment upon an employe, for
absence from his work in order to record his vote,
should be made a punishable offence.
Queer that Cardinal Moran should be
turning Carnot’s death to church profit in
Sydney, by inviting every notable in N.S. W.,
from tile Governor downwards, to a magnificent
requiem mass, “which is to partake of a national
characterwhile, at the same time, the authori-
ties in Carnot’s own France hold a secularised
celebration in the Pantheon which the clergy will
not attend. The Latin races have lost faith in
clerical intercessors ; the Teutons, slower to
believe, seem slower also to relinquish the ritual
of belief.
Four provinces publish rough estimates of
revenue and expenditure for the year to June 30.
Westralia is the only one which comes out on the
right side, with a surplus of ,£28,000, which, added
to previous credit balance, puts the province
,£90,000 to the good. Victoria shows a woeful
leak, revenue falling short of expenditure by
£530,000; while the nominal deficit is now
.£1,784,048, and the real deficit, with the Shiels-
Berry Treasury bonds added, is somewhere about
2,i millions. South Australia and Queensland
expect to just about balance.
Included in S.A. Govt, policy
is the Lake Bonney irrigation
scheme, to be run on co-operative
lines under direct State control.
Premier Kingston hopes thus to
absorb the shaky village-settlements
on the Murray, several of which
must soon collapse unless State sup-
port is accorded. The Lake Bonney
land, under irrigation, would be as
productive as Renmark, and supe-
rior to Mildura, according to ex-
perts.
The Chirnsides own about
280,000 acres in Victoria, all
“ second-class ” land, valued at half
a million, and subject to a tax of
little more than £l.OOO per annum.
Baronet Clarke possesses something
like 180,000 acres, mostly “second-
class,” and much of it third. It is
officially valued at =£375,000, and
carries a tax of less than £600!
Salmon Wilson holds only 80,000
acres, but it is valued at £155,000,
much of it being “ first-class,” and
it is made to disgorge a yearly tax
of nearly .£lOOO. The pr wince
therefore gets about £2509 a year
out of three estates valued in the
aggregate at £1,000,000 —that is, ss.
per cent. !
The Tasmanian Assembly has adopted
Treasurer Fysh’s resolution to increase the tax on
the capital value of land from Jd. to Id. in the £,
mortgages to be exempt to the extent of a |d. in

headed by Neil Lewis. ex-Attotney-General, all
failed—(l) to exempt from the increase all pro-
perties under i>soo in value; (2) to graduate the
tax between the ratios of in the £ and- Is. Bd.
in the £, according to the capital value of the
estate ; and (3) to reduce the Id. to |d. in the £.
The Bills are now running the gauntlet of the
Legislative Council.
Dear Bulletin, —The argument thatther e
should be no profitable industrial prison-labour i s
a boomerang with a wicked recoil. Following out
that principle in its integrity, the free man out-
side, who has not been found out in his illegalities)
would have to keep in idleness the caged man who
was stupid enough to be caught, and would have
to pay for the latter’s board and lodging.
The erection of gaols is an expensive luxury.
Prisoners should undoubtedly be required to earn
at least their keep, besides enough profit to pay
interest on the cost of gaol-buildings, and to pro-
vide each released man with a small sum of money
upon his exit into the world again. When will
some philanthropist arise, powerful enough, not
only to promulgate, but to see carried to a success-
ful issue, some scheme by which all but the more
desperate and violent criminals might be “boarded
out ” as are children from Industrial Schools ?
There are, of course, labour-market difficulties in
the way, but a convict’s labour should be as valu-
able as a free man’s, and his wages should be the
current rate of the market. All that the present
denouncers of prison-labour are justified in is to
demand that prison labour-products shall not be
permitted to undercut free labour-products’ prices.

If so, safe remedies are within your reach at a
nominal cost. CLEMENTS TONIC and
FLETCHER’S PILLS have never yet failed to
cure the worst cases. General debility, nervous-
ness, weakness, and general complaints of the
digestive and nervous systems are promptly cured
by these reliable remedies. They are prepared by
scientific processes, and are not merely mechanical
mixtures made only to “gull the public.” The
renown CLEMENTS TONIC and FLETCHER’S
PILLS have won in Australasia is proof of the
fact that they stand preeminent for their special
classes of diseases. No remedies ever sold gave
such entire satisfaction to their patrons, and
evidence is forthcoming from every city, town,
and village to prove their virtues. No doubt can
now exist as to their value, but purchasers must be
careful to get the genuine articles as many un-
scrupulous traders will attempt to palm off a
substitute, if possible, for the sake of extra profit.

Has the wit of man ever invented a plot or
situation which has not its duplicate in real Id®?
The chief Tanqueray complication arose through
the mother’s old lover turning up to woo the
daughter. Now it is cabled that Madame Trebelh-
Bettini, the famous singer, disinherited her
daughter because of a quarrel with a similar cause. .
Miss T.B. wished to marry Mrs. T.B.’s ancient
flame, which Mrs. T.B, (jealous, no_ doubt)
would on no account permit. Miss per-
sisted, and Mrs. left all her money to
the Academy of Music. Here you have
Binero’s idea in all essentials, if not in details.
And doubtless such a set of circumstances has
often been arranged. For what could be more
natural than that the qualities which of old
attracted a man in the mother should re-assert
their dominion in later days in the daughter ?

Vic. Legislative Council made a gorgeous
display of “loyalty” and lunacy in honour of
York’s baby. Sargood, the knighted draper with
a genius for putting his foot in it [“ Philopene!
Mr. Sargood] said the event was of special
interest to the Hempire, “ because of the
cloud that fell across the life of the mother
not long ago”—a sweet, delicate reminder that
May had consoled herself for the loss_ of her first
lover by giving him a nephew after his decease !!
James Service said the event was an advt. for the
system of Government under which the Hempire
flourishes. It was a glorious system. Every year
the opponents of the system grew “fewer and
fewer.” Once upon a time, quoth pawky James,
the people dreamed of a republic, but now they
perceived that republics “ had entirely failed to
give the comfort, solidity, and protection to life
and property which obtained in the grand old
mother country.” And Service was in London
not so very long ago, in London where ‘ the
spread of discontent is so rapid as to astonish
Anglo-Australians who make periodical trips
home !” But, after his Commercial Bank speeches,
one can believe Service capable of saying any-

and his party each night of the season. The effect
of the reply was: “Yes, m’lud —at £5 a night.”
Whereupon came the announcement that his Ex.

during the stay of the goddess. It makes a
difference, don’t it ?

Dear Bulletin, —Your portrait of the
trous—beg pardon, skirtsers—has aroused a
furore of interest. How does she get them on?
Does she pull them on over her feet —as we do; or
put them on over her head, as they do (I mean, of
course, the other sex) ? Do they button on to the
waistcoat or does she wear braces ? Are there
pockets, if so side or front ? And can a man find
them when the garments (I suppose it’s plural
number) are hanging in a dark wardrobe? Are
there buttons or hooks and eyes ? Or safety-pins
or tape ? Do they tuck up at the bottoms on wet
days? Everybody wants details. —Makkied.

The police are credited with a lot of
cleverness re the detection of the Barraba mur-
derers, Cummins and Lee. As a matter-of-fact all
the credit is due to good old “ Information Re-
ceived.” A third criminal, who was to have had
a share of the plunder, when he found that there
was no plunder, gave the whole thing away.
From the report of Barraba murder trial
Harry Tan was a very nervous man, and scarcely knew
what he was saying. He was half aboriginal and half
Chinese, and was a boundary rider.
Mr. Tan recalls a French gentleman up North
who had learnt English from blackfellows and
Chinamen. He might have known what he was
saying, bub few others ever did. For instance,
when he one day wanted to say that it would be
well to catch two horses across the creek up the
range before it began to rain, Monsieur Desqua-
ville remarked : Plenty suey tout-a I’heure. Baal
your chercher yarraman over creek longa mooltan

Good old Dr. Neild, discussing the Mel-

that Louis Juncken did not die from the effects of

dig up a hundred of her dead friends without find-
ing poison in any of them, it would be no proof
that she didn’t kill the whole lot, we suppose.
However, it is stated that Analyst Blackett has
found in the body of the deceased Juncken enough
arsenic to slay him.

Councillor Anderson, the chief champion
of electric-lighting for the city of Adelaide, died
suddenly on 23rd June, and the gas-directors are
trying to look sorry. Anderson was once engineer
of the S.A. Gas Co., and was well qualified to
speak on both sides ; he was engaged on a series of
lectures to the citizens when seized by apoplexy.
His party feel staggered by his death. Not long
ago he was divorced from his wife, who consoled
herself with somebody younger, and his gas-
shares, with their income of .£5OO a year from
divs., were among the property which passed over
to her under her marriage settlement. Therefore,
the gas-directors sneeringly said he wanted to run
down their value.

addressed a let-

DOMESTIC ECONOMY!
WHEAT IS IT ?
DOMESTIC ECONOMY is primarily the art of feeding and clothing the family at as low a rate as possible,
without impairing the family digestion, or taking away the character of its members for being well and com-
fortably dressed. Domestic economy is not comprised in buying a bad article for sixpence when better can be
got for sevenpence ; but if the ruling price for the best is eightpence, and somebody comes along and offers it for
sevenpence, then it’s domestic economy to close with the merchant so offering. By all means study this great
and glorious science of social life, because its due and proper observance cannot fail to make poor people rich, and
rich oni s richer. What say you ? Will you do your business at

It is pretty tough to ask people to believe
that a long-sentenced prisoner, lately released

for one section of the prison community
“JOE” EDGE, the cross-country horseman.
“Joe” Edge, whose photo, appears above,
started his riding career six years ago, as an
amateur, and proved an immediate success, inas-
much as he then steered his trusty nag Saxon to
victory in the Maiden Steeple at Warrnambool.
He was still “Mr.” Edge when he rode Fearless
11. in the Maiden and Grand National steeple-
chases at Elemington, running away with both
races as though there were no other horses in the
field. A while after that big double event the
smart young amateur took up his quarters in
Sydney, and had fair success “ across country.”
Returning to Victoria he shifted into the ranks of
recognised professionals, and it was as plain Joe
Edge that he annexed last year’s big steeplechase
with Trojan. A first-class rider and a clever
tactician is Joseph—a very keen Edge, in fact.
His portrait has particular interest at the present
moment, for there are weighty whispers abroad
to the effect that Edge’s mount, Bill, will possibly
capture the V.R.O. Grand National Hurdle race
on Saturday next. Certainly the subject of this
notice is worth “following” over the sticks at
meetings big and small.

Guy Boothby, the “ great Australian
explorer,” tells a story, in the Idler, about a
Governor’s wife and a policeman. A ball was in
progress at Government House, and the lady,
coming across a trooper standing guard at a door,
told him that supper would be provided for him
and the rest of the force on duty in the servants’
hall. Then she caught a view of his face and
found that he was her long-lost brother, an ex-
officer who had vanished from England in dis-
grace, several years before. “ What the sequel
was,” says Boothby, “ I never heard.” The most
obvious sequel was that the lady went back to
the ball-room, and that her long-lost brother
remained on duty at the gate, and that nothing
happened. Nothing ever does happen under such
circumstances. There is no sequel. It is only in
fiction that the prodigal son comes back and is
taken in. In real life he returns to find that his
mother has died and his father married again,
and then his father died and his second wife
married the local preacher, and the old man’s
executors sold the fatted calf to the butcher.

On the appeals of several residents, the
police of a certain southern suburb decided to
raid a “disorderly house” with the intention of
arresting the regular inhabitants as keepers, and
the casual visitors as aiders and abettors. Said
raid came off all right, but it was not a success,
and the officers had to put up with a present of a
£5 note apiece instead of the new “stripes” calcu-
lated upon. Eor, foremost among the “ aiders
and abettors,” was one of the best-known Judges
in the province.

adventure with a supposed burglar, but who was
more probably a mere offensive drunk. He walked
into her house at night and sat down in the
drawing-room. The lady entered; “Mr. ’s
not in,” she undiplomatically said. “I know,”
was the answer, but the visitor made no attempt
to move. The hostess was scared now, but kept
her presence of mind, and, running to the study,
telephoned to the office that a burglar was
in the house. On hearing the message the man
fled, and a quarter of an hour later the husband
and a couple of detectives were scouring the sur-

out success.

the easiest way to procure the land would be—(l)
Let the husband beat bis wife ; (2) let the wife get
a separation order ; (3) let the separated wife then
get the conditional purchase area; (4) let the con-

Dear Bulletin. —“ Wurlie” is somewhat
mixed, seeing that “Brigham Young” and not
“Smith ” was leader of the seceding party who went
in for polygamy. The Cape Hawke, N.S. W., people

haven’t enough females to go round twice. The

back, but without success, as the existing sensible
sexual customs made polygamy superfluous.

One Smith, British Consul at Samoa,
lately made a luminous suggestion to the Samoan
Government to prevent men deserting to the
rebels :
Upon the suggestion of Mr. Cusack-Smith, the British
Consul, an army regulation has been adopted providing
that any one who deserts shall, upon capture, have the
word “Coward” tattooed upon his chest, a stigma the
fellow must carry to his grave. Tattooing a man thus
when ho changes his politics, after the manner of
Samoans, is not likely to make the cause of the Govern-
ment popular.
This Smith is the gentleman who, among other
serviees to the cause of civilisation in Samoa,
introduced kid gloves. But, after all, he is a man
of ideas. How we wish we had tattooed Dibbs
when he was a Republican—and Parkes when he
was a Protectionist—and Stout when he was
Plain Bob -and Griffith when he was a Democrat

gone into lying as a business wear hair on their
faces —it is so hard for a nervous liar to manage
his mouth. But when a professional liar has full
confidence in himself he boldly shaves clean.
(Most lawyers are clean-shaven). The clean-
shaven liar who can really manage his mouth is a

A Bill to abolish juvenile smokers has
been introduced in Tas. Assembly by that recon-

“any constable may lay hands on any male or
female child under the age of 16 years found smok-
ing a cigar or cigarette in any street or public
place, may take away the cigar or cigarette, and
demand the child’s name and address.” A second
offence may mean 24 hours’ imprisonment. There
the Bill stops, regarding a third offence as un-
thinkable. The constable is to be sole judge of
the “ child’s ” age, sole chaser of offending urchins,
and sole reporter to parents, who may obtain the
child’s release on demand.

Four distinct charitable organisations carry
on their operations in Sydney without any refer-

that one person is sometimes helped simul-
taneously through four different channels, while,
as there isn’t enough to go round, another person
is not helped at all.
“ Tom Collins ” returns to the charge :
Dear Bulletin, —In my par., of June 16, 1 inodistly
held continence to be an important factor in fitness for
social survival, wi I h the necessary corollary, that “the
higher the ‘ moral tone ’ of a community, the better that
community will fight for freedom. “Titus Salt,” after
noticing my pure ignorance on a point of history, invites
me to build a coherent theory on certain facts supplii d
by him. In justice to myself, I may say that, as written
by me, the historical summary ran: “Sparta deterioratid
morally, and went down before Macedon, the most moral
state then existing. The latter deteriorated,” &c. But The
Bulletin, which knows everything and allows no one
else to know anything, pruned the passage not wisely,
but too severely. The Lord reward it according
to its works. Now for our facts. (1) In applying the
titles, “ hollow, garish, immoral” to virile Macedon,
“T.S.” unconsciously mixes two eras. My qualification
was strictly relative, and historically correct. (2) The
moral Ironsides defeating the mors moral Scots. Trivial;
but, in any case, Dunbar stands conspicuous as a generals ,
not a soldiers’, battle. (3) The Household troops of
Louis XIV. : These met less immoral and more formi-
dable soldiers in the sons and grandsons of the
Ironsides. Witness the terms of the Peace of
Utrecht. (4) The Janizaries: Well? Vher is dot
barty now? The point at issue is—morality in its
relation to survival. (5) The moral Puritans of New
Plymouth, and the immoral companions of Cortez :
Compare Massachusetts —which (says Prof. Nictiol of
Glasgow) has produced more thinkers than all the U.S.
territory south of Mason and Dixon's line-wilh Mexico.
(6) Henry of Navarre: Trivial again. Good man gone
wrong—provided for in former par. (7) Who said that
“ Sparta never saw a foreign enemy at its walls for 460
years?” Everyone except “ T.S.” knows that this was
the only capital of antiquity which had no walls. “T.S.”
misses Plutarch’s idea, which is, that from Lycurgus to
Agesilaus no foreign enemy obtained lodgment on
Laoonioan soil. “Many of your countrymen lie on the
plains of Thebes,” said the Theban. “ But, none of your
countrymen lie on the plains of Sparta,” retorted the man
whose morality certainly bore closer relation to his
patriotism and prowess than to bis ignorance and dirt.
(8) Modern Greece—grovelling, bankrupt, and moral, I
p ass _but with the suggestion that no immoral people
ever survived foreign tyranny such as these have borne.
(9) So with the Irish.' Moreover, the latter exhibit a
racial vitality, a resilience, and general fitness for survival
equalled only by one other race on earth. That race is
the Jewish ; and however justly we may take exception
to the shape of Israel’s nose, we must concede his
relatively high morality. “T.S.” might have trawled the
stream of history, from the ancient Benjamites down to
the Templars, and so on to his Janizaries-from the
"giant judge” to the flower of Arthur’s mythical
chivalry, and on to the “uncrowned king ” with the
same melancholy result. However, the col,erent theory
built by fair induction on these facts is this: That as the
Order of Things won’t stand phallic-worship beyond a
certain indeterminate point, “moral tone ” is not merely
an important, but an essential, factor in social survival.
One factor, of course, implies other factors, such as ent, r-
prise and intelligence—lacking in Greece; and the
faculty of cohesion—lacking in Ireland. Also we infer
from our tacts that the ageless cult of Priapus is a thing
of failure and a sell for ever. Simply my own single-
handed contention till, like Paul of old, “I was com
forted by the coming of Titus.” Clad in impassioned
rhetoric, and armed with a peculiar two-edged logic, this
champion came—like Balaam on his Soudan—to curse,
and remained to bless. And to a noxiously and perhaj s
suspiciously moral man like myself, this is eminently
satisfactory.

Despite adversities, Messrs. Goldsbrough,
Mort, and Co., Ltd., retain their place as premier
Australian wool salesmen, having disposed of
120,159 bales from March 1, 1893, to end of
February, 1894, 10,000 bales more than were sold
by the firm next highest on the list. The firm’s
Annual Review regards the general prospect
hopefully. “There will be,” it says, “a
degree of recovery which, if it does not place our
commercial and producing interests quite in the
flourishing condition in which we have been
accustomed to regard them, will, at all events,
re-establish a confidence, the want of which, in
panic times, did so much to paralyse every enter-
prize.”
M’Burney, Wallis & Co.’s Report.
Sales which end the wool year were held this week, and
we are pleased to be able to report a slight increase in
prices on those rulintr at last fortnightly auctions.
Our latest news from London is also decidedly en-
couraging, and we think when the new wool comes down
a more cheerful state of things will prevail at our wool
sales.
The rise this week may be accounted for by the good
news from London, and the presence of buyers from
Melbourne.
Wool offered was of the usual class coming forward at
this time of year, namely, scoured, and odd lots of greasy,
and a clip or two from Queensland.
Although some slight friction has cropped up over the
shearing question we do not anticipate a strike. We hold
the opinion that past strikes have been, in a great
measure, the means of bringing about the long spell of
depression our colony has just parsed through, and a
strike now, when we can just see better times looming in
the distance, would be suicidal for all. We would urge
shearers to think for themselves and not listen to agita-
tors whose business it is to create strikes that they may
have a rosy time at the expense of the working man.

Mr. John Hunter’s Brisbane factory.
For 25 years Mr. John Hunter’s enterprise has
not rested. He holds the premier position in his
trade, and it is an open question if there is a
bigger industrial manufacturing business south of
the line. First New South Wales, then Queens-
land, South Australia, Tasmania were in turn
selected as an outlet for Mr. Hunter’s commodi-
ties until “John Hunter’s City Boot Palace” is
a household word irk every Australian province
except Victoria.
Queensland is now on the threshold of an in-
dustrial greatness, and may soon be expected to
move prominently along the highway of prosperity.
The pioneers of industry in Queensland deserve
well at the hands of all true colonists. Mr. John
Hunter is one of the pioneers and it is fair to say
that he has from a protectionist’s point of view
shown what enterprise can accomplish. His aim
is to make, from Queensland leather, boots and
shoes to suit all the requirements of Queensland
people. His factory is turning out work rivaling
some of the finest that comes into the market, and
every month sees some improvement. The Aus-
tralasian boot trade is now but little dependent
upon the sweating markets of Europe; and in a
few years a French, German or Northampton boot
or shoe will be as rare in Queensland as the mega-
therium. Mr. Hunter’s factory stands on the
corner of Albert and Ann streets, opposite the
Wesleyan Church, and the building is one of the
most conspicious in Brisbane. The warehouse,
show-room, and counting-house divisions are on
the ground-floor, facing Ann-street. The offices
are well laid out, and the show-room is a perfect
paradise for those who love to be well shod. There
is displayed almost every conceivable boot and
shoe, from the J.H. nail blueher worn in mining
communities to the various fancy-makes in various
shades of Russian leather “tans,” blackened brown
canvass, white and buff and satin leathers in all
the best-known shades.
Leaving the show room and counting-house we
visit the press-room, where many sides of leather
per day are being converted into soles and heels.
The leather here used is all of Queensland manu-
facture. Next we view the “clicking ” room used
for cutting out the uppers; and here we are
enabled to examine some very fine leather
materials. Especially noticeable is some Austra-
lian satin kid, certain qualities being quite equal
to the best American satin leather.
Before leaving this floor we are shown some of
Corrick’s patent unbreakable backs, principally
for ladies’ and childrens’ boots, composed of a fine
strip of hard green hide, which prevents boots
from “sagging.” Asking to see about the best
value that Mr. Hunter offered the public, we were
shown some of his best make in the “ Federal
Brand,” which is stamped on each pair of boots
as a standing guarantee to the buyer. All the
latest improvements in boot-making machinery
are here in use, and with the improved quality of
fine Australian made leather, and excellent finish,
Mr. Hunter’s goods are pushing the English and
Continental boots clean out of the Queensland
market. Besides his numerous retail establish-
ments in Brisbane, Mr. Hunter has branches at
Ipswich, Toowoomba and Maryborough j and no
doubt ere long operations will extend to every
important town in Queensland,
AN EMINENT DIVINE.
THE REV. DE WITT TALMAGE.
HIS LECTURING TOUR IN AUSTRA-
LASIA.
IIiML
Through the courtesy of the Waterbury Watch
Company (whose Australasian head office is at 54
Margaret-street, Sydney), we are enabled to pre-
sent our readers with a portrait of the Rev. Dr.
T. De Witt Talmage, the famous preacher and
lecturer, who is so well-known as the pastor of
the Brooklyn Tabernacle, New York. Dr, Tal-
mage’s ideal vacation is, as the American terms
it, “a stay” at his new and beautiful country
home in Long Island, a few miles from Sag Har-
bour. But the rev. gentleman could not indulge
his fancy for more than two weeks this season, as
he recently started on a trip round tbe world with
his son, Dr. Talmage, of Pittsburg, as his com-
panion. During a portion of this trip the doctor
will be occupied in delivering a series of lectures
in Australasia, under the auspices of that experi-
enced manager, Mr. R. S. Smythe. He gave the
opening lectures of the series at Auckland on June
21. The wonderful Waterbury watches have
always been favourite timekeepers among the
clergy; and reasonably so, for the Waterbnrys
are durable, accurate, elegant, and inexpensive.
They rarely get out of order, and can be repaired
at a merely nominal cost. Henry Ward Beecher,
another eminent American preacher, was an
enthusiastic admirer of the Waterbury watches,
one of which he always wore. And G. H. Lea (of
Liverpool), the South African missionary, carried
a Waterbury throughout his recent journey
of two thousand miles in South Africa. “It
went splendidly the whole time, and .was twice
immersed in water without being injured.” Mr.
Lea also took with him a twenty-guinea English
lever, which went only two months from the time
it was purchased. Dr. Talmage lately celebrated
with his friends the 25th anniversary of the
beginning of his pastorate in the church which he
had made famous throughout Christendom. As a
leading New York contemporary observed the
other day : “ Dr. Talmage deserves allthe honours
that may be paid to him. During the last 20
years he has been a great power for good in the
world. Millions of men have heard his voice, and
tens of millions of both sexes have been brought
within the sphere of his influence by the printed
page. May he live to celebrate the golden anni-
versary of his connection with the Church of the
Tabernacle !”
SUNDRY SHOWS.
SYDNBS SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK,
Her Majesty’s “After Dark.”
Lyceum “The Prodigal Daughter.”
Criterion “ As You Like It.”
MELBOURNE SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Princess's “ Ma Mie Rosette."
Theatre Royal “A King of Ciime.”
Alexandra “ Sloper’s Night Out."
The Shakespearian comedy at Sydney
Criterion continues to exhibit all the various
features which were hinted at last week.
Also the improvement which this paper an-
ticipated in the Celia of Miss Moore
has not made its appearance, and that lady’s
performance continues to be as feeble and uncon-
vincing as hitherto. The Bulletin begins to fear
that it is not likely to be anything else. In addi-
tion to which its opinion of Mr. Greenaway is on
the down grade, and excepting Miss Hilda Spong,
whose Rosalind remains as lovely as ever, and
Mr. Leston, there is not one conspicuous success
in the show. As for conspicuous failures they
continue to stand up like the blighted gum-tree on
the Old Man Plain, and the two dukes, and the
exiled lords, and the wicked brother, and the
shepherds, and others are all vanity and vexation
of spirit. Last of all, The Bulletin has
a growing suspicion that Shakespeare him-
self is a delusion, a failure and a weariness
unto the soul, and that nobody really cares
for him, only everybody is afraid to express
his true opinion concerning him lest he should be
taken for a Goth and a literary Hun. Therefore,
everybody professes to love the dramatist who is
vaguely supposed to be Bacon, and almost every-
body is kept away by unexpected business, severe
cold, mumps, domestic bereavement and other
hollow pretences when the object of his adora-
tion is put on the stage. The Bulletin would be
glad to hear from persons who want to throw off
the yoke and avow their undisguised hatred of
the immortal hard—all correspondence on the
subject to be marked “ Bacon ” in legible letters
on the envelope.
* * * *
Mr. George Walton is leaving for America
—almost everybody is leaving, more or less, just
now—and the invariable benefit comes off .on
Friday afternoon at Sydney Criterion. The pro-
gramme is of the usual fragmentary order, and
includes the third act of “As You Like it,” by
Miss Spong’s Co., four comediettas, and various
other items, and all the companies now in Sydney
are represented in the cast. Mr. Walton goes to
New York, under engagement to Rice, whose
“ Evangeline ” somehow escaped its righteous
doom in this country some years ago.
* * * *
Mr. Frank Emery’s benefit eventuates at
Sydney Majesty’s next Tuesday afternoon.
*- * *
Bland Holt’s impressive spectacle at Sydney
Lyceum concludes next Friday, and on Saturday
this notable artist breaks out in a fresh place with
“The Prodigal Daughter.” This is also reported
to be an affair of great magnitude; it is the one
joy of Bland’s life to tackle dramas containing
hundreds of tons of unmanageable scenery, and
only the biggest things obtainable appeal to his
soul. Meanwhile, the “Life of Pleasure” is finish-
ing its career in a highly satisfactory fashion, and
Henriettta Watson falls away from the paths of
virtue every night in her green dress and her
green hat amid much public commendation ; like-
wise, the fetching Miss Harrie Ireland (whose
portrait is given elsewhere in this issue)
escapes nightly from the affectionate villain
to whom she has just been married. The
reason why the heroine generally falls in a green
dress and afterwards repents in a brown one and a
sixpenny hat will probably never be discovered,
but The Bulletin notes with pleasure that Miss
Watson discards the brown dress tradition, and
repents in a pretty costume which is much better
suited to her character. Much of the badness in
this world is caused by the association of goodness
with a brown frock and a sixpenny hat.
* * * *
Owing to the undue enthusiasm of the
“ push ” in the sixpenny seats, George Rignold
felt called upon last week to raise the tariff at
Sydney Majesty’s. The sixpenny crowd—or at
least that part which was sixpenny by instinct—
has since left in disgust, and “ After Dark ” pro-
ceeds much more peacefully as a consequence.
The musio-liall scene permits of the introduction
of much fresh matter, and last Saturday there
was an entire new programme ; but otherwise the
drama preserves its consistently lugubrious aspect
unchanged. There are some powerful scenes in it
—notably the tunnel and the express train, and
the scene wherein Miss Watts-Phillips casts
herself, or her dummy, headlong from the flies
into the river—but it is as cheerless as a dead fish
in a tomb, and the moaning of the consumptive
person who sleeps in a gin-case on the bridge is a
mournful thing to hear. Nevertheless, the drama
is going to keep on its heartrending way for some
weeks longer.
* * *
Arthur Garner must have dropped money
at Adelaide Royal with his company. To
follow a leg-show with the legitimate in Adelaide
spells ruin, and Garner followed Musgrove’s
beauties. The only thing to do is to bring along
another leg-show, and Tommy Hudson at the
Bijou is therefore clearing quite £lOO a week.
* * * *
Nellie Stewart achieves two specially
good bits of acting in “Ma Mie Rosette.” The
first is where Tapley points out to her that a king’s
intentions towards rustic maidenhood are never
strictly honourable. Her air of frightened inno-
cence, as she slowly “ tumbles ” to this royal fact,
is very effective. Again, when in the dream
scene, Nellie gives physical suggestion of love’s
“ mystic feeling,” her art is true to nature.
Presumably she has had the advantage of seeing
the part well played in London, or Paris, or in
both places, and probably her performance is an
improvement on what she saw, anyway.
* * * *
Williamson and Musgrove open at the
Brisbane Royal on Aug. 2 for 10 nights. “Paul
Jones ” is the first piece. Frank Thornton follows
with “ Charley’s Aunt ” on the 15th. The booking
for the B. and B. season at Brisbane Opera House
is the best locally known for years. During the
B. and B. Brisbane season two comedies, new to
Australia, will be produced. On 9th inst. “The
Sportsman ” goes up, and on the 19th “ The Bun-
galow.”
* * * *
“The World Against Her” afforded
melancholy pleasure to a crowded Melbourne
Royal on Saturday night. In time past a lucky
stroke of advertisement gave notoriety to this
crazy five-act moan, wherefore the mention of its
revival summoned mourners from afar, like the
tolling of a funeral bell. 'Twas the signal for a
hearty burst of grief in store, and the patrons of
misery planked down their small silver at the
pigeon-holes as though they were buying tickets
for "East Lynne.” Miss Maud Williamson is
the weeping wife and mother, whilst Charles
Holloway is the unscrupulous contortionist
who chases her round with vile ends in view.
Her troubles begin early and end late, but
if they didn’t end at all the audience might
enjoy itself somewhat more thoroughly. To
be a complete success Miss Williamson would
require a lingering death in the last act sur-
rounded by the body of her long lost child,
and the villain would have to cry “ By Heaven !
she has escaped me!” when he discovered
her remains. However, with the exception of
its so-called happy finish, the entertainment
is very satisfactory. J. W. Sweeney makes a
realistic Punch and Judy proprietor, and Inman
curses his innocent wife with genuine enthusiasm.
Several other people wander amidst the woe to
more or less purpose, the least human of them all
being Miss Alice Deorwyn, whose method of
passing ordinary remarks illustrates the awful
difference between a dramatic career and any
other kind of professional occupation. Next
Saturday (7th) the company will introduce the
recent Sydney nightmare, “ A King of Crime.”
*
“Ally Sloper’s Night Out,” at the Alex-
andra, shows signs of having developed from an
orthodox farcical comedy into an abnormal go-as-
you-please. Probably it was once the ancient
story of a heavy British husband who shouts
oysters for a designing Tottie, and expiates his
crime by hiding in the next room whilst his lawful
wife takes refuge behind the curtain because her
character is somehow at stake. The Robert Brough
character of the original farce is here transformed
into the infamous penny fiend of imported
“comic” literature. Also the proceedings in
general are adapted to the aforesaid creature’s
code of honour, and the result depends a good
deal upon circumstances. There are ten comic
songs and a display of undisciplined young
legs in this startling event, besides a pathetic
ballad with a row of girls swaying to and fro in
the background. A show of this sort improves
as it goes along, and if Dan Barry can get it to
progress in the right direction it may suit the
Haleck clientele better than a football-match.
Daniel himself impersonates the bottle-nose and
boiled eye of fiend Ally. Miss Lilia Wilde
betrays a turn for broad farce in the part of
Tottie, and Martyn Hagan, Dora Mostyn, Lucy
Fraser, and the orchestra do their best. Nor is
the youthful “ballet” destitute of interesting
features, above’and below.
** * *
Afc the Princess’s a steady demand for
“ Ma Mie Rosette ” culminates each week in a
great Saturday rush. Nellie Stewart’s throat is
holding out against the weather, although her
stifled coughs have an ominous catch in them, and
she is apt to omit her principal song from the
second act. According to present arrangements
the opera will be limited to a few months’ run and
the last six nights are looming near.
** * *
The Bijou was packed full on Saturday,
for the first time in many months, a significant
circumstance that may lead to a permanent occu-
pation of B. and B.’s former camp by the cheap
but reliable minstrel person. Anyway, the Cog-
hill’s first appearance there, with a company not
newer or noticeably stronger than other crowds of
the ’all stamp, gave promise of a paying season.
Alhambra show, meanwhile, is calculated to bear
comparison, and the nigger at popular prices will
have a strong grip upon the city just now, when
horsey matters are in the air.
** * *
In a week or so that sorely-depressed in-
stitution, the General Dramatic Fund, will take
a benefit in the form of a costume football match
and incidental fair. The idea is to give a large,
open-air entertainment, probably at the M.C.O.
ground, in preference to the theatre matinee of
other years. Admission to the ground will be six-
pence, or a shilling at the most, and people
desirous of further assisting the good cause can
take out the price of their benevolence in a liberal
assortment of side-shows at threepence a time.
With fine weather granted the affair should prove
a big success.
The Hallewell Glee Club will commence a
series of Saturday night concerts at the Y.M.C.A.
Hall on the 7th inst. The fact of that old Sydney
identity, Mr. F. J. Hallewell, acting as musical
director, and Mr. W. H. Whiddon as business
manager, is proof positive that popular approval
will be well catered for. A photographic group
of the members, which includes some well-known
faces, notably Mrs. Riley, Miss Gibson, Messrs.
Hinchy, Barrett, Clancy, Hallewell, and that
promising contralto, Miss Louie Galvin, may be
seen at Messrs. W. H. Paling and Co.’s.
Alto glees are announced as a specialty.
The promoters purpose presenting at each
concert a short and select scene from several of
the leading operas, those specially singled out at
present being Mozart’s “ Seraglio,” the second act
of Gluck’s “Orpheo,” and scenes from “Iphigenia
in Aulis,” “Iphigenia in Tauris,” and Handel’s
“ Semele ” and “Hercules.” A vast amount of
time has been spent in rehearsals, and judging
from the extensive preparations made, arid the
combined talent of the club, these concerts should
prove a great success.
G. H. Reid, the harmless N.S. W. political
pug, who tries to look like a bull-dog, has formu-
lated his “Freetrade” policy for the severalth
time. According to his latest pronouncement, he
intends to raise, by customs and excise taxation,
“ about <£2,000,000 a year,” so it is difficult to see
where the Freetrade cornea in. Further, hia views
on land and income tax are as follows :
I point out that in the case of every owner of land up to
£2500 improved value the tax would certainly not be
more, probably less, than £4 3s. id. a year; and in the
case of an income of £lOOO a year, derived from personal
exertion, probably not more than £l2 or £l5; the Cus-
toms duties taken off saving more than £l5 a year to the
landowner paying £4 3s. 4d. in land tax, and leaving the
incomes up to £lOOO a year in a better position than
before.
Now the one absolute certainty of the case is that
the tax which is taken off one man must be put on
to another, and when G. H. Reid promises to
take £l5 a year off the person who has .£2500
worth of land the most probable inference is that
he intends to put it on to the person who hasn’t
£2500 worth of land. This fatherly care for the
man with £2500 worth of land is ominous
for somebody. The present N.S.W. revenue
from Customs, excise and other small items
of taxation is less than £2 15s. per head,
and G. H. Reid proposes to reduce it to about
£2—a difference of 15s. per head. But as the
landholder above-mentioned is to save not 15s.
but £l5 per head, it is evident that the duties to
be abolished are those on luxuries—the kind of
duties which press especially on the rich, or com-
paratively rich, classes. Therefore, the duties to
be left on must be those which press especially on
the poor, which is a joyous prospect for Freetrade
generally and for the poor in particular.
At Wyalong, the crowd, which is generally
expected to be noisy in a mixed community,
receive the candidate in a becoming manner, and
then vote want of confidence in him. It is proved
that in nine cases out of ten, the amendment is
preferred to the motion. The Labour Party,
therefore, lies low and at the finish pops out with
an amendment like this : “ In the opinion of this
meeting, Mr. Brown-Blue is a fit and proper
person to withdraw from his candidature and we,
the electors of Wyalong, request him to canvass
the district in the interest of the candidate selected
by the Labour Electoral League.” At the last
meeting the candidate (in the Freetectionist
ticket) provided himself with a proposer (his paid
secretary) and a seconder, who travels with him
in the buggy. These were the only support he
received, with the exception of three drunken men
and six others, who thought they were voting for
the amendment.— Scotty the Wrinkles.
John Tighe Ryan’s very latest (in yet
another interview with Parkes), in the Review of
Reviews :
Sir Henry lives like an English gentleman. [Hm !
Ed. B.] He observes the ceremonies of high life, and a
prince could sit at his table. . . . He is at his best
when the ladies are in the drawing-room.
No he isn’t. He is at his best when the ladies
have left the drawing-room. Our colonial oath !
Another slab :
“ I have never known ” (says Parkes) “ what it is to
feel envious of those more favoured than myself, and I
have never withheld my last shilling from those who
needed it more than I.”
Modest, benevolent old beauty ! Again :
“ That is the key to my whole life,” he added, “whether
people accept it or not—do you understand?”
Of course John Tighe Ryan thoroughly understood-
“l am not proud of the places I held. Anyone
could get into the same places. Look at Premier
Dibbs ! ” Oh the gall and the wormwood of it!
The hated Dibbs, who has held the N.S.W.
Colonial Secretaryship, Parkes’ prescriptive per-
quisite, for three long, infamous years !
The viper Dibbs, who was photographed
with the Prince and Princess of Wales ! and
who rubbed in the vitriol by sending Parkes (who
was never photographed with any prince or king,
not even a blackfellow) a copy of the photograph
aforesaid ! The Bulletin understands old man
Parkes and sympathises with the man from
Brummagem in his ill-concealed agony.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
Squatter Manifold’s recent performer, Apsley,
is, at time of writing, the popular fancy for the G.N.
Hurdle Race. Unless something goes amiss with the not
very handsome animal between now and Saturday- and
always barring accidents in the race—it may be taken for
granted that Apsley will beat a large majority of the
opposition. Tim Swiveller, last year’s winner, is not
among the likely ones this time, but Bbor promises to
make a good show, and The Pioneer will find disciples if
he comes up to the scratch in sound condition. Unfor-
tunately there is no Eedleap for the unsophisticated
punter to stand or fall by, nor do the Messrs. Miller
appear dangerous at all in the chief events. Apsley may
be a “ real good thing ” for the Hurdle, yet the evidence
is somewhat doubtful, so in its fatuous anxiety to dis-
cover a “tip” The Bulletin will rather discover Bill, a
comparative outsider.
• • * *
Warwick Farm used Gray’s starting-machines
on Saturday with great success; the days of the human
article seem numbered. The A.J.C. will, no doubt, be
the last to succumb, but Randwick must bow to the
inevitable, and, much as the “ big " men dislike the idea
progress with the sporting times.
* « * *
Common and his rider, Mr. Mat Harris, were
“ sent up ” at Warwick Farm on Saturday for “ a sixer.”
The writer gave Matthew the credit of being a betttr
“ artist,” than to land himself in a mess of this sort.

Nat Langham, the only man who beat Tom
Sayers, must have been much such a fighter as Mick
Dooley. Langham dabbed his proppy left hand into Sayers’
face until he closed both the after champion’s eyes, and
Sayers was led out of the ring sound in wind and limb, but
stone-blind. Dooley pecked at Ryan in Melbourne last week
until Ryan’s frontispiece resembled a bit of raw liver.
This is the worst feature of a “straight left” in stage
fights. The continual taps bring the gore until the fight
resolves itself into a sickening spectacle, whilst there is
nothing to show for solid and effective punches over the
heart and on “ the point.”
• * * *
A huge big crowd witnessed the Sydney Uni-
versity-Wallaroo football match on Saturday. Wallaroo
played as it never played before, beating the hitherto
invincible ’Varsity by 9 points to 5. Randwick beat
Paddington by 5 points to nil, and Pirates beat Parra-
matta by 42 points to 3.

Stated in Adelaide that the results of most

A certain Adelaide football club committee is
openly charged with paying a prominent player, and
efforts are vainly being made to bring the matter before
the Association. When nearly all footballers receive
remuneration, it is not likely delegates are going to cut

The popular sporting brothers who backed that
smart youth, “ Pyramids,” for Sydney Talk’s billiard
tournament two years in succession, have had hard luck.
Last year, as an unknown, he had over a century as a
handicap, and at the last minute some of the “ books,”
seeing that they were sure to lose their money, ferreted
out the fact that the young man was hardly 21, and,
therefore, ineligible to compete. This year “ Pyramids,”
without having handled a cue in public, was put back to
scratch, and despite his being drawn against Sam Grim-
wood, his party backed him heavily. But, after an
exciting tussle, experience beat brilliancy on the post.
In billiards the victory is seldom to the swift. What a
“ monte ” the previous tournament now appears to have
been for “ Pyramids ” who, with time, will make some-
thing of a champion ! The of the tourna-
ment was Mr. George Kiss.
♦ ♦ * »
Comedy is beginning to get a show in Melb.
pugilistic circles (or should it be rings ?)as well as the serious
raw-meat knock-outs which constitute the tragic side.
Before the Dooley-Ryan fight started, a spar took place
between Closson and Billy Williams, which was probably
one of the most laughable things ever seen in the way of
fighting. After hitting Williams when he was on the
ground, and punching the referee for stopping him fight-
ing after time was called, Closson earned a well-merited
victory by kicking his opponent on the easiest spot to
reach and bolting from the ring. There is a big opening
for comic prize-fighting in the near future.
Old man Grace scored an innings of 196 against
Cambridge University. It was the Cantab bowling that
provided such a picnic for the Australians last year.

Parliamentary Elections.
To the Electors of New Mouth Wales*
THE OENTEAL ELECTION COMMITTEE OP
THE PROTECTIONIST PARTY.
We earnestly ask you to consider the following
facts in connection with this election : —
Under the influence and rule of the Foreign-
trade Party we have piled up a debt to foreign
countries of .£55,000,000, for which we have to
pay two and a quarter millions interest out of our
produce.
The expenditure of these loan funds created a
boom, and directed labour into the construction of
public works, to the neglect and destruction of
reproductive industries.
The collapse of the borrowing boom, coupled
with our fiscal policy, has left us without the
necessary industries to yield employment to our
present army of workers, while we have 30,000
youths from our schools seeking admittance
annually into the industrial ranks.
To meet this position foreign-trade advocates
and journalists are advising us to put all out
energies into the production of raw material foi
export to Europe. In fact, we are advised not tc
encourage the home production of ordinary neces-
saries, so that their import may provide EM-
PLOYMENT FOR FOREIGN VESSELS tc
carry our raw produce to European markets at low
freights.
Has such a policy ever established a civilised
and prosperous community in any of the new
lands into which the surplus population of Europe
is flowing? Has it done so in any of the old
settled countries of the world ? _ On the contrary,
its failure stands out as a warning to avoid such a
policy.
Even last year we imported over and above
what we exported produce SUITABLE TO OUR
SOIL and Climate exceeding the value of
.£3,000,000, not counting iron nor manufactured
articles. To supply this home demand is our best
market, and will assist in the general development
of other and varied industries, without which we
cannot find occupations and employment for the
rising generation.
The Single-taxers have deluded the LABOUR
PARTY into the belief that a tax on land would
benefit them. They have likewise befooled the
Freetrade party that a land-tax would be a taking
cry and a good policy at the very time we are
making FREE GRANTS of land and money to
induce Village Settlement.
LAND INCOMES and ABSENTEES are all
fair subjects for taxation when the necessity for
their imposition arises, but neither time nor
circumstance warrants their imposition at the
present time.
Surely it should be evident to the meanest
capacity that a TAX ON AGRICULTURAL
LAND is equivalent to an EXCISE DUTY on
its PRODUCE, and must to that extent DETER,
SETTLEMENT.
We have all the elements required for the pro-
duction of iron and ABUNDANT LABOUR for
its manufacture, while we are IMPORTING iron
to the value of HALF A MILLION ANNU-
ALLY. Our neglect of this matter is a disgrace
to New South Wales, and shows to what an extent
we have allowed the Foreign-trade element to
dominate our councils in the face of the fact that
NO COUNTRY in the world has been able to
establish ironworks without the aid of PROTEC-,
TIVE DUTIES.
All the Colonies are on the same plane of civilisa-
tion, with equal standards of living, salaries and
wages, and therefore we have nothing to protect
us against each other. It is therefore our duty
to make a great effort to have the Colonics
FEDERATED into a GREAT AUSTRALIAN
NATION.
We earnestly ask all, and particularly young,
Australians to throw educational opinions and
PREJUDICES aside in the consideration of our
position, and put an end to this INSIDIOUS
INFLUENCE, which is being exerted by
forign IMPORTERS calling themselves AUS-
TRALIANS.

Editor Hogue, of Sydney E. News, had thoughts
of emulating Lord Rosebery by bringing off a double—
Sydney Tattersall's billiard tournament and the seat at
the Glebe. Ha has lost the first “leg,” and on the
remaining one will have a hard battle.

The Akgus, in its painful desire to be popular,
allows its football man to grog-blossom into poetry as per
sample :
“ What makes the ball love Kearney so?”
The Geelong forward cried ;
“ ’Cos Kearney loves the ball, you know,”
The barrackers replied.
The head of the man who wrote that has mistaken its
avocation. Heaven intended it for a football.
• • • *
The Sydney double-shops have once more scored
a clever victory over the authorities. After the con-
viction last week of one of their number who was pre-
scribed a month’s hard, others who had been summoned
hastily got their oases adjourned for three days. In the
interim—well, the informer, who happened to be the same
person in each information, fell ill, or something: any-
how he didn’t turn up when wanted, and so the prosecu-
tions went by the board. Meanwhile, the shops are doing
business only with known clients. Some of them have
closed up altogether, and others have washed off their
signs. The police seem to prosecute only the small shops;
the miniature Tatt.’s are left alone, and the “ohip”-
houses and sly-grog shops go on serenely as of old.

Mr. “Ranny” Want, writes an Australian
abroad to Tub Bulletin, is a most devoted lover of the
ancient game of golf, and is fast making his way into the
front rank of players. He is one of the regular “ Sand-
wich men." The popularity of the game in England is
astounding, and a man is considered nothing if he cannot
play. Many a dead country town—notably Sandwich—
has received a new lease of life in consequence of the local
establishment of links. [Sandwich is now quite a pros-
perous place, where formerly it was the most dismal of
the buried Cinque Ports.
Parkes has been bombarded with con-
gratulations on the attainment of his 79th birth-
day last Sunday. A Sydney D.T. interviewer
went with a blithesome, springy step to dive into
the old man’s recollections of infancy, and ex-
tracted much information regarding his capacity
for goo-goo utterance and mud-pie manufac-
ture. Singularly enough, however, the veteran
omitted the one thing material, and did not say
that he owes his strength and health, under Pro-
vidence, to a judicious use of Marshall’s Tonic
Nervine, sold at corner of Pitt and Park streets,
Sydney.
What Princes can get for half-a-crown.
The Duchess of York has presented her husband
with a boy, a tiny little prince who will come to
the throne of England by and by, if all goes well.
It may take a good many years yet, but, from this
on, the young gentleman has something to live for.
However, should he never get the billet he is
promised, supposing, for instance, there were no
throne left for him to take a seat upon when his
turn comes, it may be well for him to learn as soon
as possible that a prince without a crown can
always afford to give half of one for some good
enjoyment, such as a bundle of 25 Frossard Swiss
Cigars. It is to be hoped that he will have sense
enough to look out that he gets the genuine article
for his money.
Messrs. Mcßu’rney, Wallis and Company,
wool-brokers, Sydney, following the example of
other firms, have issued their annual wool-report.
The pamphlet, to which the compiler has evidently
devoted considerable time and attention is a credi-
table production, and is replete with information
which makes it not only interesting reading, but
worthy of preservation as a work of reference.
The firm have reason to feel satisfied with their
first season’s work. Starting somewhat late,
they managed to dispose of 4,000 bales of wool,
a performance which augurs well for their
future prospects. As a proof of the rapid growth
of the popularity of the Sydney market, it appears
that during the season of 1890-1 there were sold
250,000 bales, whereas in 1893-4 the number was
increased to 400,500. A lot of useful hints are
given to squatters with regard to the preparation
of wool for the auction mart, on which each member
of the firm is fully competent to advise from a
lengthened experience acquired in the good old
school of Mort and Co. The smallest lots
sent to M‘B., W. & Co. receive as much atten-
tion as the largest, and their countinghouse is
under the able supervision of Mr. M'Dowell, who
was for 14 years with Mort and Co., and who
resigned his position to join the new firm.

Dear Bulletin,— “ says amuk
is not from Arabic, and that it’s Javanese as well
as Malay. Well, it’s also Macassar, and Bugis,
and Sassak, and a lot of other things—all modifi-
cations of Malay. The Portuguese did find the
word in Malay in 1511, as they also found “ Alla”
and “ Sheetan,” and hundreds of other words im-
ported from Arabia in the previous century, and
nearly all since modified in spelling, notwithstand-
ing the use of Arabic Ietters.— MACASSAR.
At a Northern police-court recently, a
white boy, five years old, was charged with being a
neglected child. His father sold him for ,£lO to a
Chinese brothel-keeper named Ah Kitt;_ and a
legal deed was drawn up giving Ah Kitt full
rights over the child’s person, and _ specially em-
powering him to send the boy to China. There is
a strong demand for white children in_ China for
nameless purposes, and such a traffic is so pecu-
liarly fit for a lawful Kanaka slave-centre like
Bundaberg that it seems a pity to nip it in the
bud by police-interference.
That fine old card-player, Captain David
Walker, of the A.S.N. Co., old regime, died the other
day at Enmore, Sydney. He was for many years
the co.’s senior skipper, and so strong in his posi-
tion that when, some 20 years ago, he lost the
steamer Auckland on the 90-Mile Beach, the co.’s
rule of going to the bottom of the skippers’ list
was not enforced. Some years later, however, he
lost another big steamer, and left the co, rather
than go down. The writer remembers him just 40
years ago, at 24 years of age, in command of
the Wonga Wonga, one Christmas trip, when
amongst the passengers from Melbourne to Sydney
was Sara Flower.
The other day Judge A’Beckett informed
six good Melb. men and true that they had dis-
credited the whole system of jury-trial by award-
ing £5O damages in an accident case where the
medical expenses resulting from the accident
amounted to £l5O. The jury had seemingly got
over their difference of opinion with an inane ver-
dict, as was done in the first Speight v. Syme case.
They mutually agreed to say that the father of a
child injured through the Railway Department’s
negligence was not entitled to have the entire doc-
tor’s bill paid, and they didn’t give a ghost of reason
for putting the blame upon the one side, whilst re-
fusing common justice to the other. The judge,
however, expressed himself warmly in favour of a
new trial, which must have been highly satisfac-
tory to the plaintiff and to the lawyers concerned.
A decision that brings discredit upon the Law is a
good thing for the lawyers, anyway. The absurdly
large number of legal persons who flourish in
Smellbourne is proof that the Law gets more dis-
creditable every year.
Dear Bulletin, —All your champion mean
men will take a back seat when I introduce mine.
Six years ago, when undergoing the colonial ex-
perience incidental to new chumdom, I met him
on the Murrumbidgee. He was travelling in
company with a black gin. Here are his words;
“I come of a good English county family—the
Pashes of Blankshire—but could get nothing to
do in a land where all the government billets are
filled by damned Irish. Oxford life has unfitted
me for beastly graft, as they call it. Poor Nelly, a
king’s daughter, has taken a fancy to me, and
saves me from the degradation of having to cadge
tucker from people who’d grovel before my aristo-
cratic parents,” Hereupon Nellie emerged from
a selector’s homestead and proceeded to fill his
nosebag with mutton and brownie. —Yours, V.
Colemane & Sons’ Yic. Ointment is marvellous.
Dear Bulletin, —Regarding “ the silver-
tongued orator of the United States.” Let

obscure American writer and speaker named
Robert G-. Ingersoll; it is printed at page 97
of a book called “Prose Poems ” (sth ed., New
York, C. P. Farrell, 1892). Ingersoll, like Bell,
commences by looking at Napoleon’s tomb, and
follows him step by step through his career—like
Bell. I have copied the peroration to show you
the unblushing nature of Ingersoll's crib :
Inobbsoll.
And I said I would rather
have been a French peasant
and worn wooden shoes. I
would rather have lived in a
hut with a vine growing
over the door, and the
grapes growing purple in
the amorous kisses of the
Autumn sun. I would
rather have been that poor
peasant, with my loving wife
by my side, knitting as the
day died out of the sky—
with my children upon my
knees and their arms
about me—l would rather
have been that man, and
gone down to the tongueless
silence of the dreamless
dust, than to have been that
imperial personification of
force and murder known as
Napoleon the Great.
Bell.
And I thought I would
rather be a peasant wearing
the burs and furz of honest
toil, with a home secure
from the fears of want or
war, where the wife could
prune her flowers in peace,
and the dimpled babe could
watch with confidence my
coming, as the shadows
lengthened on the lawn,
than to wear the name of
Conqueror, the epaulets of a
general, or a sword dangling
by my side stained by a
brother’s blood 1
The Herald says that Col. Bell’s remarks on
Lincoln were hardly less eloquent, but does not
print them. Hum! Geniuses often jump to-
gether. But can nothing be done to protect our
“silver-tongued orators” from these somewhat
brazen coincidences ?—Yours, Sir Fretful.

HERR RASSMUSSEN, PH.D.
A Few Sketches of His Interesting Life and
Work.
Herr Rassmussen, who is known throughout
the world as “ The Celebrated Danish Her-
balist,” was born in the little kingdom of Den-
mark, shortly after its last disastrous war with
Germany. His parents being wealthy, and
belonging to the most influential class, he
received a first-class education, and displayed
exceptional talent in the science of botany and
botanical chemistry, and very soon surpassed
everyone of his fellow scholars in those sub-
jects, and eventually made the science of botany
Ids life-study.
Finding his native country too small, and its
flora too limited to extend his botanical re-
searches, lie left for Australia, and landed here
in the beginning of 1879. His first object was
to learn the English language and become
familiar with the customs and habits of his
adopted country, as well as with its botanical
history and medicinal flora. Herr Rassmussen
had quite his share of the troubles and difficul-
ties which usually befall a newcomer in Aus-
tralia ; but he soon overcame every difficulty,
and after five years’ travelling through all the
colonies, investigating every known Australian
medicinal plant, and discovering many new
ones, he eventually settled down permanently
in Sydney in 1883, and then commenced a
most noble mission—that of turning his most
wonderful botanical discoveries to the benefit
and relief of suffering humanity. Herr Rass-
musseu succeeded in this gigantic undertaking
far beyond all expectations, and his name very
soon became a household word, not only in
every Australian camp, village and city, but
also throughout Europe, Africa and America.
Space will not permit to mention the
numerous cures effected by his now world-
famed Ale aline Remedies, suffice it to say
that thousands of original testimonials may be
inspected by anyone at his Head Depot, 547
George Street, Sydney, many of which may
also be seen in his celebrated work, “The
Natural Doctor.”
There is no doubt whatever that Herr Rass-
mussen deserves all the success and praise which
he has met with, because he is a most scientific,
conscientious and genuine herbalist—his last
ten years record being so wonderful that his
remedies must have cured more human suffering
in that period than is usually effected by a
hundred average doctors in a similar number of
years. He does not hold any consultation
similar to a doctor; his whole business is
purely a Proprietary Herbal Remedy Business.
He simply prepares a genuine herbal remedy
specially forthe nerves,and another for the blood,
and so on, which can always be relied upon.
He prints on the box containing the remedy its
price and all advice as to doses and diet and
other particulars, and advertises same, which
is the fairest way possible to conduct a business
of this kind. Any information or particulars
desired are given or sent absolutely free of
charge. Pamphlets are sent post free to any
person desiring one, containing all particulars
and many useful and valuable hints on health.
Herr Rassmussen has very large branches
of his extensive business in Melbourne,
Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Wellington (N.Z.),
and throughout the world. He is an
honorary member of several scientific socie-
ties, a gold medalist, diplomee and Hon.
Corr. Mem. of the Academic Parisienne des
Inventeurs, France ; last year he received the
Honorary University degree of Doctor of
Philosophy ; in 1887, he was presented with a
magnificent gold medal by several of his cured
patrons in Sydney, and also awarded a silver
medal in Denmark, 1888, a bronze medal,
Melbourne, 1893; and in 1891 he issued his
“ Natural Doctor,” a herbal medical work of a
high standard for which he received great
praise from the press, and which is now trans-
lated into many languages.

Editor Bulletin, — “Dromedary” asks
me, can a man run 300yds. at the same speed as
he can 100? Certainly not. There have been
several men credited with a few yards under evens
for the 100, but only one, as far as I know
(Hutchens), has ever done the 300 in even time.
The shorter the journey the greater the speed—
exactly, Mr. Dromedary. My “ phenomenon ’
was only a good riding camel, carrying a man
weighing about list. About that camel with
9001b. on his back. The man who drove the first
camels in harness in Australia told me that he
saw eight bags of flour put on a camel at The
Gums platform, S. A. The bull got up with them
all right, but they had to lift them off again with
the crane, as he would not lie down. It seems
incredible, but I think the bull camel was a pheno-
menon.— Flong. Booligal, June 10.
A monumental law-suit has just been
wound up peacefully at Creswick (Vic.). The
original cause of dispute was a drain, or an
embankment, or a culvert, or something—the
beginning of the trouble lies so far back that
it is almost forgotten—made by the Creswick
shire council, which caused an accumulation
of water on some adjacent land. The owner
asked that the damage should be made good, but
b hug met in an aggressive and infuriated spirit
he sued for compensation and was awarded .£10.
Then the Council started a series of appeals which
dragged on for many months, and cost the rate-
payers .£1400, and only ended when the Privy
Council shut down on further proceedings.
Finally, when no more litigation was possible, it
offered to fill in the offending drain, and as that
was just what the plaintiff had been asking all
along the matter was settled by two or three
pick-and-shovel men at a total cost of <£5. Mean-
while, a special rate will probably have to be
struck to cover the law costs.
A Tauranga (M.L.) girl lately made a
sensation. She had gone through a long course of
novels in which the heroine mostly “went wrong”
and was ultimately found dead in the river, with
her wealth of golden hair hanging about her face,
and a look of ineffable peace on her marble
features. At last she became possessed with a
yearning to be a heroine herself, so she wrote a
distracted letter to her mother stating that she
had been “deceived,” and had gone to end her
troubled life in the creek. Then she hid her-
self up a tree and watched while the _ police^and
the neighbours dragged for her remains. For a
while she enjoyed the situation immensely, and it
was only when the cold evening came on and she
realised that she daren’t go home to tea and bed
then she fully realised the horror of her position.
She remained up the tree for 36 hours, but when
the second evening came on she crawled down and
made for home in the dusk. She was captured by
her harried parents while trying to steal some
bread and jam out of the kitchen, and being called
to account she had to explain that she had not
been “deceived,” and was only suffering from
cramp through long residence in a tree.
Then the police were informed, and the search
parties were dismissed, and that night there were
sounds in these parts as of a heroine in great
trouble and promising with tears never to do it
again.
One gang of syndicators that M‘II wraith
met with in England wanted to construct 250
miles of Queensland railways on these terms : The
Co. to get 10,500 acres for every mile of railway
constructed, and to have first selection, so as to
get the best land and leave the worst for the
nation; the cost of building the line to be put
down at <£3500 per mile (instead of .£2500 as
estimated); and the State to pay 2 per cent,
interest on the capital invested until the line itself
pays over 4 per cent, to the shareholders. There-
fore, the situation would figure out something like
this ; Queensland can borrow money at 4 percent.,
and build her own railways, and as the lines pay
nearly 2 per cent, interest the consolidated revenue
has to find the other 2 per cent.; in other words,
Queensland can possess her own railways for a
present net loss of 2 per cent., and take all the
profits when they come, which they will in time.
The British shindykit proposes, on the other hand,
that it should own the railway; that it should get
nearly 3,000,000 acres of land—equal to about
twice the cost of the line—as a bonus for its
trouble in owning it; that the State should pay
the 2 per cent, interest just the same ; and that all
the profit—when there is a profit —should go to
the shindykit. Truly there is nothing quite so
mild and unassuming as a British shindykit.

They are chiefly given in complaints of the Urinary

Glands, and Retention or Inconvenience of Urine, from
the loss of tone in the parts concerned in its evacuation.
These Bitters I also recommend in Dyspepsia, in Chronic
Rheumatism and Cutaneous affections. The action of
Buchu on the human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of the Kidneys and Bladder than any other herbal
plant; and it also assists persons suffering from Skin

THIS Company is being formed to acquire from the present holders their entire interest in Gold
Mining lease No. 533 (known as M'Kenzie’s, and having an area of 15 acres), and immediately
adjoining M‘Auliffe’s Lease No. 156, which was recently purchased by Lord Percy Douglas and Mr.
W. A. Mercer for a London Syndicate. The purchase money paid for this property being .£6500 in
cash. The other adjoining blocks have been purchased at large prices by Adelaide Companies. From
advices since received great disappointment was felt by English representatives in not having acquired
this property.
As will have been seen by the reports appearing in the daily press, the White Feather portion
of the Coolgardie goldfield has been brought into great prominence of late, which has been largely
increased by the series of purchases made on behalf of English capitalists.
From the subjoined Reports by well-known mining authorities, there are two known reefs running
through the property, varying in size from Ito 2 feet, in aN. W, and S.B. course. There also appears
to be a third vertical reef, but upon which no work has been done up to the present.
The property also contains some very rich leaders, and doubtless some of these will be found to
junction in depth, giving place to another rich reef. It will be noticed that the original proprietor has
made the property pay from the start by merely dollying the stone in a primitive manner. The
adjoining properties have also been paying in a similar way.
There is an ample supply of Mining and Milling Timber in the immediate vicinity. As to water,
a most important factor in this district, there is a good and permanent supply obtainable from a lake
about three miles from the mine. Besides which, it is confidently expected that a sufficient supply will
be met with in sinking at a moderate depth.
It is estimated that the Capital to be placed to the credit of the Company, =£5250, will be more
than ample to open up the mine, erect the necessary machinery, and place it in a dividend-paying
position, when the smallness of the capital, £12,500, will tell most favourably in the results.
The Company will be declared formed when 20,000 shares have been applied for.
After allotment of the shares, a meeting of the allottees will be convened by the Provisional
Directors for the purpose of electing Directors and adopting Memorandum and Articles of Association.
The only agreement for the sale of the property is one dated 12th May, 1894, between J. R.
McKenzie and others, which can be inspected at the Company’s Office, 131 Pitt Street, Sydney.
Application for shares to be made on the accompanying form to any of the above-named brokers.
Sydney, June, 1894.
Report by W, H. Corbould, M.A.I.M.E.
May 9, 1894.
Leonard Dodds, Esq., Sydney,
Deae Sib, —I beg to submit my report on M'Kenzie’s Claim, M.L., 533. The property is situated
at the White Feather, 35 miles N.E. of Coolgardie. The property has an area of 15 acres. The lodes
being worked at present are “ Blanket lodes,” carrying very rich gold. The country is quartzite, and,
in places, the gold is showing in the quartzite. The strike of the lodes is about N.W. and S.E.,
dipping to the N.E. There appears to be a vertical lode on the property, but no work has been done
on it, so that I cannot say with certainty. Since taking up the property, M‘Kenzie has made a few
hundred pounds profit, after paying men’s wages. The two adjoining claims—Doyle’s and M ‘Auliffe’s
—have also paid all expenses and paid good dividends to the owners. The work done on M'Kenzie’s
is very primitive, and the Company will have to start and work the mine in a systematic way, which
will mean the outlay of a thousand or two pounds. Rich stone is showing in the face of the prospectors’
workings, and it may be possible to dolly enough gold to pay further prospecting of the mine at a
deeper level. In conclusion, the property is a good mining venture, worthy of being tested by a
Company.
Yours faithfully,
(Signed) W. H. CORBOULD,
Report by Robert Pettigrew,
MINE MANAGER OF THE MARITANA AND NAPIER GOLD MINING COMPANY.
Deak Sibs,— The mine that I visited a short time ago is situated at the White Feather, 35 miles
north of Coolgardie. This property is held by Mr. M'Kenzie as a mining lease, No. 533, and consists
of 15 acres. It is bounded on the S.E. by M‘Auliffe’s property, which has lately been purchased by
Mr. W. A. Mercer, of Coolgardie (of the firm of Benick, Moreing and Co., London), and it is bounded
on the S.W. by Doyle’s property (which was lately bought by an Adelaide Co,), it is hounded on
the N.W. by Meiklejohn’s property, which has been purchased by Messrs. Braidwood and Besford, of
Adelaide. All three properties are raising good stone, and have dollied out sufficient gold to pay
all working expenses for the last five months. I consider lease No. 533 is equal in value to any of the
above blocks mentioned. There are two known reefs running through this property, and a number of
rich veins. The reefs are from 12 in. to 2 feet wide.
Very little work was done on those reefs at the time of my first visit, but on my second visit a
large amount of trenching had been done, exposing the reefs. The stone taken from these trenches is
very rich in gold; this gold is well disseminated throughout the stone, and, in ray opinion, is rich
enough for dollying. Mr. M'Kenzie has been paying all working expenses by this means.
The strike of the reefs is west by north, with an underlay of 20 min. nor’-east. The hanging
wall of the reef is quartzite, the foot wall is diorite. Samples taken from the hanging wall prove this
quartzite to be gold bearing, and in Doyle’s block, 30 feet from the boundary line of McKenzie’s, I saw
large blocks of this quartzite broken from the hanging wall which was sufficiently rich for dollying.
There is a good supply of mining and milling timber on and in the vicinity of the property to last
for many years.
The water at the White Feather is obtained from a lake three miles away, where a good supply is
always obtainable, but I have no hesitation in saying that water in sufficient quantities will be got in
sinking at a depth of 160 or 200 feet.
Speaking of the White Feather generally, as a reefing field, the nature of the country leads me to
believe the gold will not be found in patches, but uniformly distributed throughout the stone. I also
think the reefs will continue to a great depth, and will increase in width and richness as depth is
attained. Developments up to the date of my last visit confirm the above opinion, and all mining
men of any standing who have visited this field are very favourably impressed with it as a reefing
field.
There is no doubt the leaders on this and the adjoining properties are immensely rich, and all
leading towards the main reefs.
Gentlemen. —l have no hesitation in recommending this property to investors as a valuable mining
property.
Yours respectfully,

Report hy J, Treloar,
MANAGER OF THE AGNES GOLD MINING COMPANY, HANNAN’S RUSH.
. . Hannan’s Rush, May 10th, 1894.
I have visited this property, and have great pleasure in reporting as follows :
The mine is situated about 16 miles from Hannan’s Rush, and the place is known as the White
Feather. The lease, No. 533, adjoins on the S.E. McAuliffe’s lease, which has just been purchased by
Lord Percy Douglas and Mr. Mercer for an English Company, and on the S.W., Doyle’s, which has
just been floated in Adelaide.
The property consists of 15 acres, and there has been large quantities of gold taken from the
alluvial workings on the course of those reefs. Very little work has been done on the property, as the
stone has been taken out for dollying. There are two reefs on the property, varying in width from 9 in.
to 2 feet, widening out as they go down, and can be traced right through the property.
The strike of the lode is N.W. by S.E., with an underlay to the N.E.
There are also several very rich leaders in various parts of the property, and I have no doubt that
some of those will junction at a depth, and more than probable a rich reef will be the result.
The gold is well distributed through the stone, and is a good battery stone, being free gold, and
should yield several ounces of gold to the ton of stone.
I saw the lessee taking a quantity of gold to the bank that had been dollied : it was from small
gold up to |oz. pieces. I believe this property to be one of the best situated, for most of the rich
leaders running through the properties on the White Feather. Therefore, I am quite certain the
property is a very valuable one, and I can strongly recommend it to the investing public.
I may mention that M‘Kenzie has made it pay from the start.

Dear Sirs,—
„ , The following is my opinion respecting the reefs in the “ White Feather ” district,
near Coolgardie, Western Australia :
Regarding their permanence—that is assured. Timber for fuel and mining purposes, without
question, the best on the “ Yilgarn ” Goldfield, and a lasting supply of water within a few miles.
Although many of the lodes carry good dollying stone, their character is not patchy, but good
general milling quartz, the gold being both coarse and fine and equally distributed through the vein.
Body of crushing stuff varies in thickness from 2 to 4 feet, and, as a rule, increases in size with depth,
with no falling off in gold yield.
These reefs should give excellent results, having the undeniable advantages of timber and water.
I am, Yours faithfully, A. GOLDIE.

The Bulletin’s prophecy some weeks ago
that the Queensland Government’s parsimony in
the distribution of blankets would lead to trouble
among the natives has received a tragic fulfilment.
Forty-nine aboriginals live on the Palm Islands —
19 men, 16 women, the rest children —to whom
Tozer, in the generosity of his heart, sent nineteen
blankets, with a result exhilarating in the extreme.
For some hours a free fight raged among the Palm
Islanders over the insufficient shoddy, which
eventually became the property of the nineteen
who were not hors-de-comhat
Henry Green, who, according to some of
the newspapers, suicided at Glenelg (S.A.), in
Japanese fashion, by slashing open his abdomen
with a razor, was a victim to his own—to put it
mercifully— “obstinacy.” Some years ago,
Green, physically a splendid specimen of man-
hood, was a grazier and cattle-dealer at Bourke
(N.S.W.), well-known as a sportsman, and of
considerable wealth, in fact, one of the “ Darling
Kings ” before the railway reached that river.
About eight years ago, he purchased from a
carrier giving up business, a waggon, harness, and
team of horses, the purchase-money being .£2OO,
for which he gave his cheque. The vendor of the
team disappeared for a couple of years, in fact he
admitted having been “in trouble;” he had lost
the cheque and waited upon Green to get a dupli-
cate. Green enquired at his bank and found that
the cheque had never been presented—that, so
far, he had not paid for the team. He declined,
however, to give a new cheque for the missing one
unless the carrier could give him an indemnity,
in the event of the first cheque turning up. The
carrier explained that having been in trouble it
would be impossible for him to obtain security.
Green persisted in his refusal, but the man was so
urgent for what he considered justly due to him
that Green offered .£25 to settle the matter, thus
admitting the liability. The amount was refused.
Next evening the ex-carrier went to the principal
hotel in Bourke, where Green was enjoying him-
self. He called the latter out into the passage
adjoining Cobb’s office, and repeated his request
for a settlement. Green again curtly refused.
“ Then,” said the unfortunate man, “ take that!
at the same time levelling a revolver and firing.
The ball struck Green in the back, near the spine.
As he fell, the carrier put the revolver-barrel into
his own mouth and fired, falling dead alongside
Green. The latter was paralysed from the waist
down. All available medical skill was invoked,
but the ball could not be reached. Green, as will
be noted, lingered some eight years, and then,
according to the newspaper reports, ended his
misery.
“ Why should women go blushing and

The pair of hump-backed whales which
lately visited Hobson’s Bay seem to have been
lost solely through the squabbling of the two old
men who, being whalers of experience, were chosen
as leaders. One was a Greenlander and the other
a Hobartarian, and all their time was apparently
occupied in deprecating each other’s methods.
Alleged ad. from a Belfast (Ireland) paper :
“For sale, beautiful coloured engraving of Last
Judgment, 4ft. by 3ft., showing Protestants going
to heaven and all others hurled into the pit.” If
this yarn isn’t true it ought to be. The principal
joy of every religion consists in expecting that the
other fellow will be hurled into the pit, and the
reason why the churches hang on to their pit so
desperately is that without it there will be no
place for the other fellow to be hurled into.
Dear Bulletin, —The ’possum with a bare
patch near the base of the tail is called, in Tas-
mania, “joey-ridden.” I have never seen a buck
denuded of fur in that particular spot, but have
shot and snared many does so marked. From my
experience I believe that ’possums do not squat on
their tails either in the hollows or forks of trees,
at least not in this country. They crouch in a
forked branch like a cat, and in the hollows curl
themselves round like a sleeping fox. On one
occasion I shot a doe out of a tall gum, and when
I picked her up there was a good-sized joey on
her back also dead, and with his tail twisted
round that of the old one. —Yours, 0. H. Read,
Tas.
Dear Bulletin, —Be the hanged, burglars*
Is it not remarkable that this di cussion was as
though the “word of God” were still impregnable?
as though death and judgment, Heaven, &c., were
still identical ? But do not the highest modern
names, Huxley, Tyndal and others, give the
“ next world ” the flattest of negations? Has not
even Parkes desperately resented the lessened
support of Orangeism by certifying to “certain
and unbroken rest?” Is not suicide making
enormous strides, and are not able men recom-
mending its legalisation? How, then, does
judicial “ mercy ” to the condemned stand now ?
Whatever a man’s state, and however great his
happiness, if the grave means nothingness,
punishment has no meaning for him the instant
he actually dies. Then put against such
mortal interpretation the fifteen years of
prison, which, I believe, here represent re-
prieve, and the popular logic may be abso-
lutely topsy-turvy. The great English reviewer
drawing a model State, makes all judges, etc.,
learn by positive experience the nature of the
penalties they order. (Mr. Stead skips the slight
difficulty here met in the British legislative treat-
ment of youth). However Utopian this idea it
impresses the folly of the word “ Mercy ” as
against the gallows, used by those who know
nought of, or reflect not on, penal servitude. And
even if we swallow the awful dose of “Revela-
tion,” may not real mercy still be that of the
hangman? Dare we allot “ damnation ” to such
of these men, born and reared we know not how,
but possibly the prey of vicious circumstance from
the cradle, while such a monstrosity as his late
Lordship of Ailesbury, the millions wherewith
idiots dowered him all sunk in the basest uses,
dies of debauchery at 30- how ? Similarly
doomed? Ask any priest and get “lost” your-
self for blasphemy again t the axle-greased of
God. —James Osboene, Harden.

Some lines of a poem by “ The Australian
Laureate ” (Douglas Sladen), published in his
“Selections from Australian Poetry” (Walter
Scott), It is the epic of “Mrs. Watson : A
Queensland Heroine.” This vigorous woman,
“just a mother,” with her infant, was attacked by
blacks on the desolate Queensland coast. She was
baffled and beaten back in an heroic struggle with
the marauders:—
So she stored a ship’s boiler, her tank, with provision
And water enough, as she thought, for the while,
And, taking the firearms and ammunition,
Launched out on the deep for a fostering isle.
What wonder if Gilbert, who sank in the “ Squirrel,”
Or Davis, or Baffin, or Frobisher shrank
Prom facing the strange, supernatural peril
Of crossing the sea in a water-worn tank.
Ye gods 1 She also took with her a diary in which
she kept a record of events. Everything that
could possibly come under the notice of a woman
at sea in a rusty boiler was noted down —
No drain left to drink !—yet she would not be fearful,
But in painful and feeble handwriting had writ
That her baby “ was better and more cheerful,
And condensed milk appeared to agree with it
Not even the steamer when passing so near her,
Unheeding the signals she hoisted in vain,
Could sicken the hope from her heart, or dis-oheer her,
She noted it down, but she did not complain.
These gems are selected from an embarras de

About a score of pale spectators supported
wrestler Jack Graham — i.e., they mostly stood
afar olf and prayed for safety—on the occasion of
his recent experimental interview with Fitzgeralds’
lions. This long-postponed event took place
at noon, in the tent adjoining Melb. Alexandra.
Five months had elapsed since the lions last saw
a human being in their airy lair, and Graham was
the only person in Melbourne who wanted to let
them see one now. The hard-framed wrestler was
dying to go in. A possibility that he might be
dying when ho came out was suggested in every-
body’s countenance except his own, also the
incidental ceremony of heating several long irons
in a charcoal fire added a peculiar zest to the fes-
tivity. There were three lions—John Burns and
his two sisters—the same vivacious creatures
that had mauled Humphries at Albury, but grown
much bigger since then. They became unusually
blithesome when the lock of the cage door was
tested. Burns, in particular, danced for joy with
such abandon that the spectators withdrew their
moral support to a greater distance off, and com-
pared notes as to their respective plans in the
event of the den falling asunder. Dan Fitzgerald
having provided himself and two menagerie atten-
dants with red-hot irons, the new tamer went in
on the nod. He didn’t pause to knock at the
gate, or scratch his head while entering. He just
got there as soon as po-sible, and waved a greeting
to the lions with his little crowbar. Fortunately
they didn’t rush to meet him, and on the
whole they behaved fairly well. When Graham
moved, the 1 ions moved. Once John Burns showed a
disposition to slap the visitor on the back, but Dan
Fitzgerald happened to intervene with his hot iron,
and the pleasantry was never perpetrated. After
the more peaceful of the lionesses had jumped
over a board in a manner strangely docile by com-
parison with the other two beasts, who simply
reared upon their hind legs, or stood on their tails,
and clamoured for gore, it was unanimously
decided that Jack Graham had done his duty, and
the curtain fell amidst loud applause. He had nob
tamed the lions much, but the lions, on the other
hand, had not tamed him. T T nder these circum-
stances the animals were engaged to give their
performance in public for the future, and the com-
pany went off to reconstruct their shattered nerves
with a drink. The dauntless wrestler was the
only man in the crowd who didn’t need a tonic.

Dear Bulletin,— Your “Wild Gat” man ad-
vises Fire Insurance Co.’s to stand oS from flat-footed
men and “persons who turn the palms of their hands
backward when walking," if they would be saved from
destruction. Now, 1 never before heard that these pecu-
liarities were included in Nature’s signs of a wrong-’un ;
yet no sooner had 1 read that par. than a vision of a
certain “ gent one,” now doing his five years, arose before
me. He was the ugliest walker I ever saw—splay-footed,
and with a habit of using his arms like a pair of crutches,
the palms turned backward and the fingers spread all
abroad. On his passage from England some 12 years ago
he was regarded as the butt of the second saloon, and was
commonly known as “ Spoopendyke," or “ Spoopy,” for
short. He could never walk a dozen paces without grab-
bing hold of a rope and holding on as though the ship
were going from under him. In that position, with his
foolish-looking mouth wide open, he appeared the mildest-
looking solicitor who ever pocketed a trust-account. This
personage changed his name after he landed, and thereby
hangs a tale—but 1 will postpone that tale.—Yours,
A. W. J.

tity on condition that if it did not absolutely clear any
run of rabbits in a month the National Wool Co. would
forfeit £5OO, but if it answered, the Co. would want the
£25,000. The offer was refused.

A big pastoral Co., in Melbourne, was inter-

wanted to borrow on a “stock mortgage.” As rich men
“run in all colours,” the manager, regarding him as an

particulars as to where the stock was depasturing, how
many head, &o. But when the would-be borrower had to
start undressing himself “to round ’em up,” as he
placidly remarked, the manager promptly closed negotia-
tion] and the deal did not come off.

his deposit of £107,000 at the Commercial Bank of Aus-
tralia fell due (and was promptly withdrawn) four days
before that Institution “ shut up shop.” By the way, one
of Martin’s original partners in the rich claim at Ballarat
is living with scarce a copper in Ireland whilst the other
(who took £lO,OOO for hU share) has a small Irish farm
and just makes a comfortable living. £200,000 would

Dear Bulletin,—The hardship in connection
with the liability of mortgagors, pointed out by a corres-
pondent in your last issue, applies with greater force to
lessees—that is, people who take a lease in the first in-
stance and assign it to someone else. An original lessee is
always liable on the covenants contained in his lease,
notwithstanding the fact that it gives him power to
assign, and that he has assigned. For instance, if a man
takes a lease for, say, 15 years and assigns it to another,
and that person fails, 10 years after, to comply with its
terms, the landlord can compel the original lessee to pay
the rent for the unexpired term, and comply with the
other covenants in the lease. I don’t think this view of
the law, which is unfortunately correct, is generally
known. 1 know that not long since I raised the question
in connection with a lease, and a leading firm of solicitors
in Sydney were very much surprised when they found
that their client was liable, after they had advised him
that he was free. When a lessee assigns a lease, with the
concurrence of his landlord, he should get a release from
the covenants of the lease.— Paolo Macari.

Dear Bulletin, —The Q. Sugar-lands Guarantee
Act, which enables the Govt. to advance money to cane-
farmers on the security of their land, has so far been
hardly taken advantage of except to boom land values ;
and 1 will tell you why. All the best land in the province
is mortgaged to the banka. The banks have any amount
of money idle, and if they really wished to help the
farmers, it is the easiest thing in the world for them to
advance the money to build the mills themselves. They
are much better able than the Govt, to watch over the
expenditure and keep straggling debtors up to scratch.
But no! they put up the Govt, as a stalking-horse,
to take all the risk, while they collar the profits.
The mortgaged land is worthless now ; when the mill
is up, it will have a value at once. The hitch at present
is that the banks refuse to give the Govt, a first mortgage
on the land, and all the managers in all the little country
towns are pressing the farmers to clamour and shriek
until the Govt consents to take a second mortgage.
Then the doubly-mortgaged serfs have still to borrow
more from the banks to put in a crop of cane. Once
the mill is up, a little pressure from the banks,
and they will explode. The straw shareholders in-
solvent, the Govt, must sell the mills, which will be
bought by the banks, who will drive the few good
shareholders insolvent too. Then the banks will
have land and mills, and the way will be clear for
a big boom on the English market, an incursion of aristo-
cratic white planters working with New Guinea labour,
and the realisation of Miss Floral Shaw’s beautiful dream.
That will put the banks straight again. Some of them
are mighty crooked now, after having advanced millions
of depositors’ money to their political friends—who, I
must say, do their best to repay the obligation. Your*,
Meg ass.

Mr. L. W. Marsland, of Charters Towers, sums
up freeholder's status under Q. mining law in a lucid
pamphlet. That law is briefly this: There are two in-
cidents in legal property—property and possession, it a
wears his own watch he has both property and possession
in the watch. If A lends the ivatch to B, A retains pro-
perty, and B has possession. If A gives the watch to B,
both property and possession vest in B. Q. Supreme
Court decides that a Crown freehold grant does not carry
gold and silver beneath the surface —they remain the pro-
perty of the Crown. Two judges (Griffith and Real) hold
that possession passes to the freeholder; one (Harding)
holds that both property and possession are retained by
the Crown. An appeal is to be made to the Privy Council.
The point lies here. A cannot lend his watch
to both B and Oat the same time. But the Supreme
Court decides that he has lent it to B, and O cannot have
it. Thus B can act, as at Charters Tow’ers, the part of the
dog in the manger, refusing to use that which he does not
use himself. There are freeholds at Charters Towers, the
minerals under which can only be profitably worked from
existing deep shafts. To sink new shafts on the freeholds
themselves would not pay. But, relying on the majority
decision of Judges Griffith and Real, the freeholders can
refuse ingress to work the minerals 1000 feet below the
surface —though these minerals are not their property
unless they are paid to consent. If Judge Harding is
correct, the freeholder has no rights beneath the surface,
and the minerals can be leased and worked by the first
applicant as if the surface were held as Crown lands.
Whatever the Privy Council may decide to be
the law, the principles of equity and of general goldfields
legislation in Australia demand that the freeholder should
either work the minerals under his land or allow others
to work them without fee. As the holder of the surface,
he might be conceded a preferent right to the minerals on
fulfilling labour conditions; failing this, the first applicant
should be empowered to wmrk them. No compensation
whatever should be paid unless surface interests were
damaged. Of course it is a mistake to alienate freehold
on goldfields at all; but on the Towers the mischief was
done ignorantly. Some years ago Horace Tozer, now
Q. Minister for Mines, proposed a surface-hold tenure, by
which the freehold should be carried down to 50ft., say,
from the surface, and all beneath should be Crown lands
available for goldfield lease. The scheme had a good deal
to recommend it, but came to nothing, the Gy tuple
miners, to whom it was tentatively suomitted, preferring
the present leasehold tenures held by use and residence.
On many grounds it may be held that their judgment was
sound. Land speculation, with its concomitants of
gambling, booming, and bankruptcy, is almost wholly
stopped, and the loss of overdrafts and palatial buildings
can be borne with. So successful indeed has leasehold
tenure been in lessening the train of rent and interest
victims on goldfields that it could be applied to other
township residence areas without the slightest difficulty.

Examinations in insolvency supply Melbourne
with some of its ghastliest specimens of legal robbery
these bankrupt times. Nothing practical seems to come
of the average insolvency examination, except costs.
There are Strange Disclosures and Humorous Proceed-
ings, and occasionally “a witness” is Rebuked by the
Judge; but one never hears of unhappy creditors pro-
fiting by the assignee's action. The examination is seldom
more or less than a job for a barrister who assumes an air
of meaning to “ get to the bottom ” of the case for the
sake of people other than himself. The insolvent is
examined, and adjourned, and examined some more,
and then the inquiry closes in a hurry. It is cut short
in its prime and buried. The lawyers hive got
to the bottom of the funds provided by the trustee, and
the trustee presently informs any creditor who applies
for a dividend that there would have been a dividend if
the examination (which he usually orders without hem;
authorised) hadn’t eaten up the balance of the ass ts. A
creditor requires time for getting at this horrible fact,
the caretaker of this vanished estate beimr invariably out
when he calls for information, whilst the clerk never
knows whether the affair will “ show any thing ’ or not.
If Baron Rothschild were to file his schedule for fun, the
trustee’s clerk would have doubts as to ibe < stale
“showing anything.” Also, it would be a long time
before a red cent was shown, anyway.

There is indisputable evidence that gold-stealing
goes on very largely on the Queensland gold-fields. A
return furnished to the Warden by the banks enables him
to distinguish purchases of bullion from those of alluvial
gold, and also those from places outside the particular
goldfield in which the institution carries on business.
Gold can be thus assigned to its locality. Bank purchases
of bullion nearly always exceed the returns of mills and
other reductive works. On certain goldfields the amount
of gold not traceable to legitimate sources amounts to
thousands of ounces annually. The Under-secretary for
Mines draws attention to a measure submitted to the
Volksraad by the Witwatersrand Chamber of Mines, to
license buyers of gold, who will be compelled to make a
statutory declaration of the circumstances under which
the gold was obtained. As any intelligent gold-stealer
will cheerfully make ten statutory declarations if neces-
sary, this system would probably be found interesting, if
not useful.

When State or municipal loans are issued in
France it is a case of first come first served; the sub-
scribers roll up at the counter and dump down their
money, and if the loan is in demand the late comers
are disappointed. When the city of Paris issued
its recent loan a crowd waited all night with its money
outside the doors of the Credit Lyonnais, to rush the
place as soon as it opened in the morning. Among them
was a young clerk whose employer had sent him along
with a big roll of bank notes. All night he gripped the
precious bag of money with a firm conviction that it
would be stolen, and with an awful sense of responsibility
upon him. It wasn’t stolen, but the sense of responsi-
bility was too heavy, and he went off his head in the night,
and in the morning a lunatic was found at the front door
of the Credit Lyonnais gibbering feebly and grabbing a
bag of money with both hands.

The dodges of even eminent firms in the furni-
ture-trade. A suite of Chinese-made furniture is sent to
a white furniture-maker, who is ordered to build one suite
exactly duplicating the Celestial production. This having
been done, the Chinese cabinet-makers are kept busily
going with orders for similar suites. A purchaser comes
along and is shown the Caucasian-made set, and buys.
But he doesn’t get that one. He receives a Chow-made
suite, while the “ decoy ” suite is set out in another part
of the show-room, to await the coming of the next Chow-
hating fly, who wants furniture made by white labour.
Since the Chinese work at starvation rates, about 16 hours
a day, and all day Sunday, the extra margin of profit
made by the artful furniture-sellers may be guessed at
rather than told.

The Patient's Hand-Bell.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Dr. Lawton sat down to his dinner in a dis-
tinctly irritable frame of mind. He had only just
come to Hospital as house-surgeon, and in the
midst of the hundred and one worries of settling
down, he had by no means appreciated finishing a
long day’s work by having to dance attendance on
a particularly fussy “ honorary ” as the latter
mide his rounds. Now he expended some of his
acaunulated vexation in a vicious thump on the
knob of the hand-bell, which stood within reach
of his right hand. Unfortunately he did not
derive the relief he expected, for the thing
refused to ring, an additional grievance which
resulted in the use of vigorous expletives.
Luckily these were cut short by the entrance of
the ward-maid bringing his dinner, and the meal
began to work its due effect on the hungry
animal.
Before long the house-surgeon had sufficiently
recovered to take his usual amicable view of the
world at large, and when the bell which had so
firmly resisted his efforts obligingly rang of its
own accord, he only looked amusedly surprised.
Taking it up he examined it carefully. It was a
slightly concave disk of brass on a stand ; but he
could neither move the knob at the top, nor the
hammer underneath.
As he turned it slowly round a knock came to
the door and the matron entered.
“This is a nice useful sort of bell you’ve given
me, Mrs. Boyce; you evidently don’t mean me to
become a nuisance by ringing too often.”
The house-surgeon, in that beneficence of mood
produced by the happy combination of a good
dinner and an excellent digestion, spoke quite
genially, and he was utterly surprised at the
effect of his speech. The matron, a pleasant-
looking, middle-aged woman, turned a chalky-
white, then she flashed a glance at the ward-maid,
who, with a frightened look on her face, was clear-
ing the table, her trembling fingers jingling the
glasses and china.
There was a little pause. Then the matron
spoke quietly but rather hoarsely.
“Do you find it hard to ring, doctor ? All you
have to do is to press the centre of the knob
firmly. It is rather stiff ” —and she showed
a small hollow in the knob.
“ It’s rather a complicated dodge for such a
simple thing,” was the doctor’s comment; “only
don’t blame me if you have the trouble of coming
for nothing : it seems to have a little way of ring-
ing all by itself” —and Dr. Lawton put the bell
on the mantelpiece as he prepared to follow the
matron out of the room.
Amongst the private hobbies which Dr.
Lawton rode with enthusiasm was the study of
hypnotism. He possessed a certain degree of
clairvoyance, and that and kindred subjects were
of the keenest interest to him. His position at
the hospital, while affording him ample experi-
ence, gave him plenty of time to pursue such
studies.
One evening, a month or so after coming to the
hospital, he was sprawling comfortably on his big,
leather-covered sofa, enjoying a final pipe before
turning in. He was ruminating in a lazy sort of
W ay on various phases of his favourite subject; an
extreme quietude pervaded the room, broken only
by fche striking of his erratic handbell. He was
used by this time to its vagaries, which he put
down to the cussedness of feminine gimcracks,
and noW; as it disturbed the silence, it only served
to recall, in his semi-comatose condition, the fact
that everyone connected with the hospital, whether
matron, nurses, wardmaids, or porter, was ob-
v;ousjy an( j undeniably scared at its ring,
m « «
The heavy smell of sleep hung over the
j on g hospital ward, saturated though it was with
theodour of iodoformand carbolic acid. Therowsof
beds veiled in mosquito nets ranged against either
wall looked like ghostly catafalques shrouding
unreal forms made grotesque in the dim light by
reason Q f the cradles and other surgical appliances,

soft deliberation from bod to bed, cast quaint
shadows on the spotless floor. Now and then a

oa il e( j the nurse’s attention. Nearly always this
sound came from the bed at the farther end of a
ward, and again and again the nurse went to the
Jg.
patb;n t.
She had done this for perhaps the twentieth
time, when ths matron appeared at the entrance
to the ward. For a moment or two they stood in
conversation. Presently the matron walked down
the toom> stopping to take some small object
f rom the long table. Then she passed on to the
bed where the wakeful patient lay feebly tinkling
his bell. She, too, tried to soothe his restless com-
plaints, but seeing he was not in a condition to be

gasp, he fell back on his pillows. His jaws gaped,

The house-surgeon was not more awake
now, lying on his comfortable sofa, than he had
been a few minutes before, when he so clearly saw
the struggles of the dying man to ring his hand-
bell.
There it stood on the table near him. Just
then the hammer struck against the brass
disk. The matron entering the room heard it,
the usual scared look coming into her face at its
sound. She had come to ask for a prescription the
doctor had promised her, but she had hard work
to steady her voice to make the request. Dr.
Lawton went to the writing-table and wrote for a
minute. Rising, he crossed to the matron, and
spoke
“Mrs. Boyce, can you tell me how this dent
was made in the side of my bell ?”
He was a resolute man, and, as he spoke, his
voice sounded harshly, almost intimidatingly, in
the woman’s ear. She made no answer, and for a
moment he stood looking compellingly into her
eyes.
“It was given,” he went on, “to a patient in
No. 3 ward, and in his death-struggle it rolled on
the floor.”
A long, gasping shudder ran through the
woman’s frame. She threw up her hands as if to
shield herself.
“Sir,” she said, brokenly, “it was not our
fault; we did not know. We had no idea he was
so ill; the doctors even did not think he was in
danger. It was hard to ring, and we often gave
it to troublesome patients. They were just as
pleased as long as they had a bell of some sort,
and he was an extra troublesome one—just the
wreck of a man, brought in to end his days in the
hospital. He seemed likely to linger on for
weeks; failure of the heart’s action the doctor
said it was; but as there is a God above I hope
and pray that worrying over that bell did not
hasten the end. Sir, it has driven us most
demented. Put it where we would it rang, till it
frightened the senses out of the patients and
nurses. When you asked for a bell, I thought
surely you had done no harm, and here it might
be quiet,” and the woman broke down, sobbing
like one at last relieved of a burden too heavy to
be borne.

The next day, a typical Sydney summer
day, a half-decked sailing boat was scudding
down the harbour. In it were two persons, Dr.
Lawton and the man who owned the boat. There
was a fairly calm sea, and they turned between
the Heads, and out into the ocean. There Dr.
Lawton took a small and heavy packet from
his coat pocket, and, going forward, quietly
dropped it over the bows. Had he been asked, he
would hardly have cared to state his reason ; still
less could he account for his very genuine feeling
of relief as they put about.

According to Rabbi Adler, of England,
in some of the great Jewish houses an account is
opened with the Deity, whose share of the busi-
ness profits is equitably posted to the account and
duly expended in the relief of the necessitous, not
so much as an act of grace as one of strict justice,
Baron Hirsch is an instance in point; and Cardinal
Manning, commenting on the Jewish practice of
tithes-giving, estimated that if the English nation,
whose realised wealth totals <£12,500,000,000, and
whose yearly income is pursued the
policy of giving one-tenth thereof yearly to the
poor there would be an annual fund of <£130,000,000
available for raising the submerged tenth. In
New South Wales and Victoria five millions per
annum could be raised on a similar basis.

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
It was a Western manager, and a language-man
was he,
Thus spoke he to the shed-boss: “Send ‘The
Rager ’ round to me;
I’ll hie me to the office where I’ll write his crimson
cheque,
Bid him roll his dusty swag up, or I’ll break his
no-good neck.”
So when the bell was ringing—when “ smoke-
oh !” time was o’er,
Says the shed-boss, “ Mick, your services are
wanted here no more.”
Then “The Rager” hung his shears up, stepped
from the shearing floor,
And went a-swapping swear words ’round at the
office-door.
For the boss began to language, and “Theßager”
languaged back ;
Says “ The Rager ” —“ There’s my brother, can’t
you give him, too, the sack ?”
“Your brother? D n your brother ! Yes,
send him ’round here, quick 1” -

Sydney D.T., in a foreign-trade snuffle,
defames Protection, with this as a collateral mis-
representation :
The Australian province whose tariff is highest is now
seen to suffer most, under circumstances common to the
whole group.
Not admitted. There were some few circum-
stances “ common to the whole group,” but
Victoria had Matt. Davies and 00. all to itself.
Further, the D.T.’s argument amounts only to
the self-evident truth that, if two men are on a
ladder, one half-way up and the other three-
fourths, and if the ladder snaps, the uppermost
man gets the more serious shaking, Victoria was
highest up the ladder and went nearest to breaking
its neck. That’s all.
Dear Bulletin, —The Ajrgus ;
If we come to first principles, surely the laws should be
passed by those who have to enforce them. And are we
to turn our women into soldiers, sailors, policemen, and
bailiffs ?
Here we have another precious guiding principle—
namely, that soldiers, marines, policemen, and
bailiffs should be our lawmakers. It is a first
principle, and it is in force now or else the argu-
ment as against women does not stand. The
soldiers and marines decide when war shall be
declared. Policemen frame our Crimes Acts, and
bailiffs initiate the laws of distraint. These lies
are true, the only truth that ought to be a lie is
that landlords pass our land laws, and creditors
make poverty a crime.—G.B.

“The Last of Six
Tales of the Austral Tropics.
By ERNEST FAVENG.
With Prefatory Note by Rolf JBoldrewood.
Opinions of tHe Frees :
“ The volume takes its name from one of the sketches, ‘ The Last of Six,’ though in point of merit they all stand pretty well on a par. The
author, who is familiar with life in Northern Queensland, writes with vigour about the doings of the whites and the natives in these faraway
parts. A strong vein of mysticism runs through his narratives, and there are ghosts in almost every chapter, and for those who are fond of
realistic work the volume will prove attractive reading.”—S.M. Herald, July 8, 1893.
“ No writer has given the world a more vivid description of Australia and its wilderness than Ernest Favene, and the secret of this is that
he has, by many years’ experience of travel and bush life, acquired a knowledge of this continent which is possessed by scarcely any other writer.
He, too, possesses great descriptive powers. Whatever he puts pen to is certain to be good. In the stories under notice he has given us some of
his best work. That they will be widely read is certain.”— Sydney Mail, July 8, 1893.
“ They present with force and vividness, as well as with the accuracy arising from long contact and keen observation, striking pictures of
parts of Australia unfamiliar to most of its inhabitants ; they tell, sometimes with remarkable power, of incidents such as happen in wild places
when human hearts are stirred by strong passions, and of weird imaginings that move the minds of lonely men. ‘ The Last of Six ’ is a terrible
suspicion
approaches Poc. This
characteristic is especially noticeable in ‘ Spirit Led,’ which the great American might have written. ‘ A Cup of Cold Water ’ is, perhaps t be-
hest tale in a collection that should be widely read, and which forms a worthy addition to ipurely Australian literature. Daily TflFukyfh
July 15,1893.
“ ‘ The Last of Six:’ and other stories. By Ernest Favene. (Sydney: The Bulletin Newspaper Co ) This is a collection of short but
graphic sketches by Mr. Favene, the well-known explorer, who has a rare collection of Australian legendary lore. All the stories here are good
and we can heartily endorse the recommendatory notice by Rolf Boldrewood prefixed to this collection. The present issue forms the third of Thic
Bulletin series of Australian reminiscences.” — Australian Star, July 15,1893.
