To Correspondents,— EKve: “A First
Lesson in French ” can be posted you for 3s.
4d., or “The Art of Teaching and Studying
Languages ” for Bs. The former gives simply
an outline of the larger work. It is a book for
teachers, not for students; and the method
seems fantastic, though suggestive. It doesn’t
profess to teach French—only how to teach
French ~.W. J. : The best “ Tristram
Shandy ” is that just published in 2 vols. of
Methuen’s “English Classics” (posted 4s,
each). The books are admirably turned out
with clear type and wide margins, bound in
buckram Darwinist: Kidd’s “ Social Evolu*
tion ” is the latest contribution to pseudo-
science-suggestive, certainly; but merely a
dogmatic deduction from an unproven a priori.
Price, 12s. 9d. posted—and not worth it.
Better wait a few months for a cheaper edition.

Whether considered as a means to education or recrea-
tion, good eyesight gives us more satisfaction than all our
other senses put together; our eyes should therefore be
treated well. Thousands of persons who could not pre-
viously obtain Spectacles to correct their defects of vision,
have testified to the relief and comfort experienced when
fitted by WOOD’S standard tests.

A facetious settler at Toonabuc (Vic.),

had neglected to provide an undertaker.
Orchardson’s “ The First Cloud,” pur -
chased for the Vic. National Gallery for <£2750,
seems to have been only a replica. If so, there is
ground for a hearty protest against the artist or
the London committee, inasmuch as these gentle-
men were badly taken in if they didn’t recklessly
pay a false price for the picture. “The First
Cloud ” is not a mighty work either in conception
orexecution—-twoordinary modern “society” figures
occupying an immense tract of drawing-room
interior—and a replica of it couldn’t be worth
anything like the sum aforesaid.
All over Australia, Judges’ associates have
a good time. These gentry, taking Victoria as a
•ample, draw J£3oo a year each, their duties being
to sit in front of the Judge and cancel the filing-
stamps on affidavits and other documents. There
is no training required—the duties can be learned
in a day. Besides the regular salary, all associates
are commissioners for receiving affidavits, and
receive about .£3 a week from this source. Then
they get huge fees for making (or rather sweating
the miserable clerks who make) copies of their
Judges’ notes of evidence. Their hours (when it
is not a holiday) are 10 to 4; all their exs. are
paid on circuit, and altogether an associate’s billet
is a rosy one. As an instance that merit has
nothing to do with their appointment, it is suffi-
cient to mention that the associates to four of the
Victorian Judges are the Judges’ sons.

From Torturing Skin Diseases
When a single application of the Cuticura Remedies will, in
the great majority of cases, instantly relieve the most agonizing of
itching, burning, scaly, crusted, pimply, and blotchy skin and scalp
diseases, and point to a permanent and economical (because so
speedy) cure, when the best physicians and all other remedies fail ?
Cuticura Remedies are the
greatest skin cures, blood purifiers,
and humor remedies, are absolutely
pure, and may be used by the
youngest and most delicate with
gratifying and unfailing success.
CUTICURA

allays the most intense itching,
burning and inflammation, permits
r
rev
m
rest and sleep, speedily heals the CUTICURA TYPES OF HEALTH AND BEAUTY,

tifier, is indispensable in cleansing diseased surfaces. Cuticura
Resolvent, the new Blood and Skin Purifier and greatest of Humor
Remedies, cleanses the blood of all impurities and poisonous ele-
ments, and thus removes the cause. Hence the Cuticura Remedies
cure every disease and humor of the skin, scalp, and blood, with loss
of hair, from infancy to age, from pimples to scrofula.
Ali. about tub Blood, Skin, Scalp, and Hair,” 64 pages, 300 Diseases, 50 Illustra-
tions and 100 Testimonials, is wrapped around every bottle of the Cuticura Resolvent.

skin and complexion soaps, while rivalling in delicacy and surpassing in purity the most expensive ol
toilet and nursery soaps. The only medicated toilet soap, and the only preventive of inflammation

A S WETNURSE or general to elderly couple,

When the Duke of Edinburgh was in
Melb., he stated, according to the Argus, that the
crowd welcoming him was the largest assemblage
he had ever seen, with the exception of those of
the Princess Alexandra’s entry to London and the
Duke of Wellington’s funeral. As a matter of
fact, Edinburgh was absent from England on each
of these occasions.
During a recent earthquake in Italy 60
people fled into a church to pray, but the earth-
quake destroyed the church and buried the
worshippers in the ruins. It is under such pain-
ful circumstances that the Presbyterian Assembly
“sees regret the spread of modern indif-
ferentism/and lays stress upon the great necessity
for encouraging tinner faith in a personal deity.”
In face of the evidence now extant, Annie
Besant’s defence of Mrs. Mellon, on the grounds
that she herself witnessed no frauds and that
under some circumstances allowance should be
made for hysterical mediums who commit frauds,
stamps the apostle of Theosophy as either unwill-
ing to admit facts which tell against her theories,
or as incapable of estimating the value of proof.
Cardinal Moran is an attentive reader of
the sermons preached by all sorts of Protestants,
and scissors into a neatly-kept scrap-book passages
w hich strike him as of future controversial value.
Enthusiasts also send him cuttings dealing with
doctrinal matter, with their own comments, some-
times at essay length, on the views propounded.
Hardly anything new, even new stupidities, can
be written on such subjects ; but to the Cardinal
the themes are aM-absorbing,
“I think that in the land-tax alone \ ®
have the task before us of winning back for the
State, either by taxation or in specie, the land of
which the State has been wrongfully deprived. I
think that we have, and not far off from us,
the national duty of regulating, and, indeed,
entirely altering, the whole system of taxation,
and of instituting a system by which acquired
property shall bear the greater bulk of the national
burthens. ”— Higinbotham.
Spokeswoman for Emancipated Females
(to distinguished politician): “This deputation
wishes to know if you will consent to address a
meeting to be held under the auspices of the
Gimlet Suffrage League?” D.P.: “I shall have
the greatest pleasure in acceding to your wishes.”
“Then we may programme you for next Tues-
day?” “Certainly.” “Thank you very much.
Good morning.” “Good raor , er, by the
way, on which side am I to speak ? ”
Nervous sufferers will find it worth their
while to peruse Herr Rassmussen’s advt. on page

London Sun lately printed a poem as
by Oscar Wilde, and next week it found out he
had nothing to do with the authorship, whereupon
the editor accused him of plagiarism. Oscar arose
in wrath and denounced this exhibition of the
“coarse humor and coarser malice that are, by the
contempt of all, conceded to the ordinary jour-
nalist.” The Sun made a weak explanation, and
added to the offence by saying the editor had
thought the poem a relic of Oscar’s “ forgotten
and generous youth.” Then Oscar closed the dis-
cussion with the remark that such thoughts
“ showed a lamentable ignorance of the nature of
the artistic temperament. Only mediocrities pro-
gress, An artist revolves in a cycle of master-
pieces, the first of which is no less perfect than
the last.” Which magnificent utterance knocked
the Sun right out.

The little maiden who is full of romances
concerning love’s young dream should seriously
consider the tale of a married pair, as told lately
in Sydney divorce-court. The lady, whose front
name was Mary Ann, wedded at the age of 14
years and 8 months, and the rest of her story goes
into a few words. The pair quarrelled for 24
years and then He cleared out. They bad
nine children, who all grew up to be navvies. The
mother alternately attended a railway-crossing
and kept a boarding-house. Also He turned
up occasionally for 14 years more and raised Cain,
and only went away again when there was no
more Cain left to elevate. Think of the vari-
ous elements in that romance: He —his wife
Mary Hann—24 years dish-throwing—l 4 years
running a boarding-house—a family of nine navvies
—and at last a plain, stout, honest old boarding-
house keeper, environed by an odor of fried steak,
applying for a divorce. Apparently there is a
material gehenna, after all.
NO LAND-TAX!
** O, spare our land!” the Fat Men groan—
“ Tax anything but ‘Thrift; ’
Retrench until you bare the bone,
And let deficits drift.
The democrat of justice prates ;
He does not understand
What harm is done to large estates
By taxes on the land.
“ Send civil servants off to dig
In barren spots remote ;
Reduce—begad ! it’s far too big—
The education-vote;
Tax incomes, if it must be done,
Though with a gentle hand ;
But please respect the squatter’s run
Ar.d do not tax the land.
“ Consider, too, the farmer poor,
A good old ‘ gag ’ is he ;
* The wolf is howling at his door ’ —
That wolf’s the mortgagee.
’Tis true he doesn’t make a fuss,
Or sympathy demand ;
But spare hitn, for the sake of us,
And do not tax the land.”

SATURDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1894.
A Public Works Policy.
It may be accepted as a matter proved
beyond dispute that the hot’ > i has fallen—
for the time, at all events—o .; of the Public
Works policy of all the older provinces of
Australasia. With the exception of Westra-
lia, which is only just starting on the same
giddy race as its predecessors, all the States
of the continent and the adjacent islands are
suffering from severe financial stringency.
There have been great and wonderful chances
within the last half-century, such chances as
no people on this earth—not even the gaudy
conquerors of Mexico and Peru—ever en-
joyed within historical times, and they have
been remorselessly squandered by those
grand old pioneers whose memories Austra-
lians of to-day are still taught to reverence.
There were immense revenues to be derived
in the early days from the goldfields and
from the sale of a virgin continent—enough
to build all the public works which could be
required in three generations ; and there
were big surpluses in the Treasury,
and the pioneers fooled them all away.
They ate up all the available capital in the
present, and inaugurated a loan policy by
which a national railway system was built—
largely for their benefit—and the bill handed
down to posterity. Most of that system
cost twice its real value, because of the vast
expense involved in buying back land which
the pioneers had sold to themselves for a
»ong in former days, and much of the money
required to buy it back was borrowed at
exorbitant interest from foreign usurers.
And for these and many other reasons Aus-
tralia owes to these rude forefathers of the
land a debt which can’t be expressed on
their tombst mes without speaking evil of
the dead a d using unseemly language con-
cerning their bones.
* • •
The present situation is the natural result
of the policy adopted in the past. In Vic-
toria, Queensland, and New South Wales
all the more immediately profitable railway
lines are already built, and involve a heavy
annual loss to the revenue. The lines
which are now required—if built on the
same old plan, with money borrowed
in England at heavy interest and mostly
fooled away in paying enormous prices
for resumed land—would probably increase
that annual loss until a financial collapse
became inevitable. Meanwhile, the almost
entire stoppage of public works has thrown a
large number of people out of employment
and increased the general distress, and with
the increase of distress the public revenues
have dried up, and thus the evil has reacted
upon itself and multiplied at compound in-
terest Therefore, the great questions
among the stereotyped financiers of Aus-
tralia are now, first, how to raise more money
for railway construction at a sufficiently low
rate of interest ; and, second, how to devise
some method whereby lines can be built so
cheaply that they will pay working expenses
and interest in remote and barren regions
while those in more fertile and better popu-
lated localities fail to do so, and yet freights
and fares can be made so low that settlement
will be possible. It is sufficiently evident
that none of these things can be accom-
plished by the methods now in use, and to the
politicians who exist in the rut of old tradition
no other methods seem possible. Yet The
Bulletin firmly believes that other methods
are possible and even easy. The result is not
to be arrived at by building light lines which
will need constant repair, or narrow gauge
lines which will need entire reconstruc-
tion in the near future, nor by “ private
enterprise,” either under the land-grant or
any other system. The engineering methods
now in vogue are mostly good enough. It
is the financial methods which require entire
reorganisation.
•• • .
One of the heaviest items in railway con-
struction is the vast amount paid to land-
owners who block the way. In many cases,
this item forms much more than half the
cost, and it is safe to assert that three-
fourths of this cost, together with much
legal expense involved in arriving at a
settlement, are fraud pure and simple. As
a general rule, it may be assumed that the
State pays five times the market value for
every inch of soil resumed, and while the
present system lasts, and while “expert”
and “ Ananias ” remain convertible terms,
and juries and arbitrators maintain their
present high-water mark of imbecilityand cor-
ruption, this evil is incurable. The simple
remedy, as The Bulletin has often pointed
out, lies in an enactment providing that
State or Local Government land-tax valua-
tions—with, perhaps, 10 percent, added as
compensation for disturbance—shall be the
price at which all future resumptions shall
be made, and that no Ministry shall have
power to alter the valuation in any way, or
under any circumstances. Such an enact-
ment would at once reduce the cost of rail-
way construction by probably 40 per cent.
And as the natural corollary of this statute a
Betterment Law should be enacted so that
the cost of a new railway would be borne in
part by those adjacent proprietors whose
land-values are enhanced by the public
expenditure. If the State levied from these
individuals even 30 per cent, of the addi-
tional value conferred upon their properties
by the construction of railways or other
public works, it would effect a great saving,
and a further revenue would be derived from
the land-tax on the enhanced value of the
properties. By these devices it may
reasonably be assumed that the cost of
railway construction could be reduced
by 70 per cent. —in some cases by an
even larger proportion. Litigation could
be obviated, under the Betterment Act, as
under the Land Resumption Act, by the
simple and equitable principle of making
each landlord assess the added value of his
own property, and —where the estimate was
grossly inadequate and no reasonable settle-
ment could be arrived at—giving the State
authority to take over the property at the
owner’s valuation and sell it for its own
profit. By this strictly just policy the cost
of railway construction, in any ordinary
country, could probably be brought down
to not over £3OOO per mile, instead of the
£13,000 which has been the average rate for
New South Wales and Victoria in the past.
# • «
Even at this figure, however, railways
cannot, at present, be built to any large
extent out of revenue. Also, however favor-
able the money market may be, and however
low the cost of construction, there are many
thousands of reasons why not another mile
of line should be built with money borrowed
at interest either in England or Australia. As
an example of possible ways and means the
case of New South Wales may be taken as
an example. In that province the actual
bank-note circulation stands at £1,500,000,
with a slight tendency to increase in propor-
tion to the increase of population. It re-
mains so steadily at, or about, this figure,
that £1,500,000 may be taken as the amount
of paper-circulation at present required to
carry on the business of the community. If
the State took over the entire business of
issuing notes it may therefore be assumed
that there would be no difficulty in keeping
£1,500,000 worth of legal tender paper in
circulation. If the banks doing business in
the province were required to keep a small
portion of their local reserves in the same
State-guaranteed currency, the issue could
easily be raised to £3,000,000. This
amount should be ample for the require
ments of many years to come, therefore the
issue could be absolutely limited to this
figure ; and, with so small an amount in cir-
culation, depreciation, under any reasonably
solvent Government, would be impossible.
* # *
Under an efficient betterment law and an
equitable land resumption system, the afore-
said £3,000,000 would be sufficient to build,
by careful instalments, say, 1000 miles of
railroad. These lines would not cost the
State a single sovereign in gold. They
would be required to pay nothing save actual
working expenses and a small percentage on
their nominal cost with which to redeem the
State paper issued for their construction,
and when it was fully redeemed the country
would possess 1000 miles of railroad, free of
debt and costing absolutely nothing. Even
the nominal price of construction would be so
small that the lines might easily be made to
pay a dividend of at least two per cent. —an
amount which would be only equal to ten
shillings per cent, on the cost of a similar
line built under the extravagant principles
hitherto in vogue. The Bulletin firmly
believes that, under such careful manage-
ment as that of Commissioner Eddy, it is
possible, even in these times of depression,
to build, within the next few years, 1000
miles of railway, either in New South Wales
or Victoria, which would not only pay
working expenses but would also pay
a dividend on the original outlay, if
constructed on the system above described.
And it maintains that this scheme is the only
one yet formulated which will permit of rail-
way extension oq any adequate scale under
present conditions. The old conditions were
suited well enough to the lavish times when
Australia was rich, and took no thought for
the morrow, and the curse of foreign capital
had not yet come home to roost. Now,
however, that the country is poor, and the
morrow which seemed so far off has arrived,
it is necessary to start on an entirely new
plan. The Bulletin is not necessarily
wedded to its own particular scheme ; if a
better can be suggested it will be glad to
advocate it to the best of its ability. But,
until a better is suggested, it presents this
plan as one which, in honest and capable
hands, will fill a dire emergency.
• * 9
The great difficulty in the way of its
adoption is the unreasoning dread, enter-
tained by the half-educated politicians of
Australia, of anything bearing even the sem-
blance of a forced paper currency. The great
majority of these individuals have no reason
for the faith that is in them save a vague
knowledge that, in many cases, such a cur-
rency has ended in serious depreciation and
consequent embarrassment. Not one person
in a thousand studies the causes which led
to this depreciation ; the great majority only
know that it took place, and assume,
because it took place, it is the necessary
accompaniment of an irredeemable—even
temporarily irredeemable - paper currency
under all circumstances. As a matter of
fact, under certain conditions, all currencies
are liable to depreciate. Silver is just now
at a woeful discount. Gold, at one time, in
Australia, was depreciated to a greater ex-
tent than the paper rouble is now in Russia.
And Government paper money has suffered a
serious fall where it has been issued in enor-
mously larger quantities than the community
required, and by States whose credit is at a
very low ebb. In Russia, for instance,
where the paper circulation is nearly
£200,000,000, Italy (£140,000,000), Argen-
tina, Paraguay, and other countries, where
the circulation is fully eight times the
actual requirement, and where there is no
earthly prospect of redemption, paper is con-
siderably below par, and is likely to remain
there. It suffers as any other article does
when sold in large quantities by forced
auction on a falling market. But there is no
case on record where paper money issued by
a solvent constitutional Government which
was not in danger from internal or
external war, the said paper being
issued in just sufficient quantities to
answer ordinary commercial purposes,
and used for reproductive public works
only, has undergone depreciation. There
have been few instances, certainly, in
which a non-metallic currency was issued on
an honest and scientific basis, but in those
few instances it has invariably retained its
value. In any case, however, even allowing
for all risks, real and imaginary, the experi-
ment is worth trying. No risk involved
could be greater than that implied in a con-
tinuance of the borrowing policy which the
old pioneers inaugurated so gaily.
The Meaning of Muckneillism.
Editor Bulletin,— My corpse, when I have
one, will wear on its forehead a small hole made
by the ring of a man whose fight I tried to stop.
That was some time ago, when I was younger,
and taught Sunday-school, and believed there
was virtue in the text which blesses peace-
makers. Ever since then, I have doubted the
solidity of certain integral chunks of “ the im-
pregnable rock of Holy Scripture;” and, when-
ever I see a fight, I content myself with execut-
ing strategic movements round the outskirts
and cheering the combatants on. Consequently,
I have waited to make sure that “Tom Col-
lins” and “Titus Salt” have definitely
slaughtered one another, and finally retired
each to his own wigwam to hang up the other’s
reeking scalp, before venturing to rise and
address you on the subject of the orthodox
morality.
It was never absolutely certain what tree
those redoubtable warriors were barking up ;
but, apparently, Tom asserted moral nations
were the bravest, and Titos said no, they
weren’t. Neither troubled to define bravery or
morality ; but, as the fight proceeded, it
beeai ite clear that by bravery they meant
physical bravery, and by morality sexual con-
tinence according to conventional notions;
Now, all the casuists put what they call
“moral courage” higher than physical courage;
though I can’t see it myself. To me it appears
easier, say, to endure for conscience’ sake the
anger of friends, or the frown of the world,
than to stand up and he killed in somebody
else’s quarrel. In the one case you have always
self-approval and the hope of living to triumph
after all; in the other case you’re mutton, and
there’s an end of everything. But let that
pass, and consider “morality.” Undoubtedly,
what is commonly meant by an immoral man is
a man who is familiar with a woman not his
wife, and who is found out. The finding-out
is essential. “ Society ” generally gives a man
the benefit of the doubt, and holds him
innocent until he is proved guilty. If he is
sufficiently high up like the Duke of
York, for example proof is impossible.
Did all the Totties in Montreal, and all the
admirals in the British fleet, come forward to
testify against such an exalted personage, the
Archbishop of Canterbury would still solemnly
assure the GoD-fearing British public that its
future monarch was vinjo Intacta. A duke
cannot under any circumstances be immoral;
and in proportion as a man approaches ducal
rank more proof of immorality is required.
Even Judge Hanganflog would probably not
convict a C.M.G. on the evidence of less than
nine private detectives—or three reputable
witnesses. But if John Smith, laborer, is not
immoral simply because he is a laborer, he
becomes so the moment he takes Mary Jones
down the harbor on Sunday. Any respectable,
jury will henceforth award heavy damages,
against John Smith.
* * #
Of course, the moment the question is looked
into, it is clear that no arbitrary regulations for
the formation of sex-relationships can ever be a
standard of abstract right and w r rong. Morality
used to be founded on religious dogma, com-
prised in various systems of sanctions and,
prohibitions invented by priestcraft and pub-
lished as supernatural. A great portion of
mankind still reveres the barbaric dicta of so-
called divine revelations ; and the whole human ,
race is more or less influenced by them. But
now that science has put out the fires of hell,
modern philosophy has formulated the simple
and rational creed that morality is to be tested i
by utility. All actions which profit the com-,
munity are moral actions : all which hurt it are.
immoral. Yet even here we reach no ultimate*
standard. The conduct which helps a com:
munity at one time may not help it at another
time; conduct which profits one community may,
injure another differently situated. This, it is;
true, does not concern the individual, who has;
only to apply the maxim, “Do as you wouldl
be done by,” wherever he may be. But an un-
easy feeling is growing up that the interest off
the individual frequently conflicts with that off
the community, so far as it is ascertainable..
Philosophy can only find its moral authority in
regarding both interests as identical. For if
the interest of the individual does conflict with
that of the community, the welfare of the mass
is of less importance to the unit than his own
welfare. Why should he sacrifice himself for
others without return ? Religion replies : in
order to get a harp and crown in the next
world. But there is considerable doubt about
the next world, nowadays : the harp is out of
tune, and the crown is rusty. Philosophy can
only beg the question by reiterating that the
sacrifice of each is repaid by the sacrifice of all,
which is just what is disputed. And the
anxious enquirer remains in his hole.
# # •
Take the monogamistic marriage as an illus-
tration. Now, the limitation of one man to
one woman in some societies is no more moral
than the limitation of one man to six women in
others. A man in Turkey, with half-a-dozen
wives, is just as moral as a man in Australia
with a single follower. If anything, the Aus-
tralian is less moral in the abstract, because
monogamy is unnatural, and the average man
satisfies his primitive desire for change in ways
which are decidedly prejudicial to the com-
munity. As a matter of fact, the conditions of
sexual union vary indefinitely, and the artificial
restrictions of custom can under no circum-
stances be accepted as a test of morality.
Love is as natural and as necessary as hunger,
and there is no more essential immorality
about the pairing of any two human beings
by common consent than there was about
the pairing of the mythical Adam and l
Eve in the Garden of Eden. Savage nations i
love as simply as they eat and drink. As
civilisation has become complex, various regu-
lations have been made in the interest, or the
supposed interest, of society ; but their obliga-
tion is purely voluntary. And, if it does not
suit the individual to guide his conduct by
these regulations, philosophy may hold him im-
moral from the point of view of the community;;
but it has no warrant for considering him im-
moral in se. Still less has religion —particularly
that form of religion which, singularly enough;,
condemns illegitimacy and suicide, though itself
founded on illegitimacy and consummated ini
suicide. Illegitimacy, indeed, whatever its;
conventional character, can never bear a moral!
reproach. The mumbling of a particular for-
mula by a man in a black coat has no bearing:
whatever upon the instinct which leads to*
sexual union, or upon its consequence in the
sacred mystery of birth. What is perfectly
natural must always be perfectly moral.
• • #
It is the fashion, of course, to consider
sexuality an unclean thing—a manifestation of
the degenerate flesh which must be crushed out
by the soaring spirit. This conception of a
physiological function, in which the quality
of purity or impurity can no more inhere than
in the sparkle of a dewdrop or the rustle of a
leaf, we owe to the Oriental religions of which
Christianity is the modern exemplar best known
to us. This it was which colored the teaching


of Jesus; which caused the mutilation of
Origen ; which pointed the temptations of St.
Jerome and St. Anthony ; which filled monas-
teries and nunneries with celibates; which
introduced the church service for the purifica-
tion of women after childbirth ; which lies at
the root of Muckneillism, with its horror
of the nude and its detestation of danc-
ing. Yet dancing is essentially a religious
custom, that is to say, a sexual custom—religion
being for the most part merely a manifestation
of omnipotent sex. When, guided by history,
we survey the workings of this mysterious
principle, and note how, to this day, the arrival
at puberty is among savage nations the occasion
of religious rites which survive in the “ con-
firmation services” of Christian churches; how
nearly the whole of religious “conversions”
are effected during adolescence, when sexual
passion is strongest; how epidemics of erethism
invariably coincide with religious revivals, and
issue in the gambols of the Early Christians, in
the orgies of sects like the Russian “ Christs,
or in the practices which have made choir-
meetings and Sunday-school picnics a by-
word; how the religious instinct is strongest
in women, who are especially creatures of
sex; how girls like Bernadette of Lourdes,
on reaching puberty, are markedly subject
to religious hallucinations ; how religious
exaltation like that of Annie Besant in her
youth finds vent in ecstatic self-devotion as
the spouse” or “the bride” of a sensuous
Christ ; how frequently parsons have large
families, and how curates and priests are adored
by the women—particularly single women ; how
countries like France, where religion is in dis-
repute, have a low birth-rate, and countries
like England, where piety is prevalent, have a
high one ; how religion is strongest among the
poorer classes, who propagate rapidly, and
weakest among the rich, who propagate slowly;
how the modern decadence of religious
beliefs has been accompanied by a corres-
ponding decrease of virility—the marriage-age
showing a steady tendency to rise, while, as
Grant Allen puts it, “ young men are less of
young men than formerly ;” how people leave
off going to church when they get married;
how, in countries like India, where religion
still directs the minutest actions of life, child-
marriage is a national custom ; how sexual
criminals, like Deeming or Mrs. Needle, are
invariably religious ; how the Biblical heroes
“ after God’s own heart” were all polygamists:
how, in the Salvation Army, it is found that
male soldiers more easily convert the women,
and female soldiers the men ; —when we con-
sider these facts, and the many similar ones
which readily suggest themselves to every
observer, we see the justification for Ellis s
statement that “ the phenomena of the religious
life generally are to a large extent based on
the sexual life,” or for Nordau’s statement
that “ religious mania almost always co-exists
with disturbances of the sexual system, and is,
like them, a manifestation of a morbid state,
proceeding from the same pathological modifi-
cations in the condition of the brain.”
# • *
Thus the religious instinct is merely the off-
spring of the sexual instinct; and in its crusade
against sex religion is acting the part of a
parricidal CEdirus. Yet the role is the only
one possible to it. Amare et venerari vix
deo conceditur; and if humanity spends its
energy in passion it will not save it for religion.
You cannot eat your cake and have it, and the
inculcation of clerical celibacy is based on a
perfectly just and logical appreciation of the
facts. St. Paul knew' what he was talking
about when he said that unmarried men looked
after the Lord, and married men after their
wives. The vital force of every individual has
absolute physical limitations, and the worship of
God is irreconcilable with the worship of Woman.
No man can serve two masters —or a master
and a mistress. In the early days of religion
this great truth was not recognised, and the
ancient temples were tended by both priests and
prostitutes, who pooled their earnings amicably,
as befitted their common origin in primal
human impulse. The sacred prostitution which
some Eastern nations imposed upon all women
survived to a comparatively late age in the
worship of Mylitta, and with the Kadeshim
attached to Hebrew temples. These allies the
priests specially recognised as “ Deva-Dasis,
or “ God’s women.” But as religion waxed
complex, priestcraft understood that women
were rivals and interlopers in its domain, and
so drove them forth from the temples and fas-
tened upon them an opprobrium for which
there is no rational warrant. That the con-
ventional marriage is frequently legalised
prostitution is indisputable ; and the formality
of a contract makes no difference in the penal-
ties which follow sexual excess.
# • «
But the religious standpoint is perfectly in-
telligible. Every concession to the sexual
instinct takes something away from the religious
instinct; every obol offered at the shrine of
Venus is threepence less in the collection-plate.
Thus it is to the interest of the Muckneillists to
denounce dancing, which in civilised communi-
ties has lost its religious character, and is merely
an incitement or a satisfaction of passion. The
most ignorant evangelist knows instinctively
that Woman is his hereditary foe. Her success
is his failure ; and, feeling the inequality of the
conflict on a natural footing, he insists that she
shall submit her charms to the handicap of
high-necked dresses, so as to give him a reason-
able chance. If the age-long contest, Heaven
v. Earth with the Priest as counsel for
Heaven, the Woman to represent Earth, and
the Natural Man as arbiter—every success of
the priesthood has been marked by insistence
that women should wear more clothes. Ihe
first thing a female convert has to do is to put
on an old pair of the missionary’s trousers.
When every lady is robed from neck to knee,
after the fashion of a New South Wales Legis-
lative Council bathing-suit, the missionary
begins to have hope that the male converts’
tribute of cocoanuts will not fail him. Simi-
larly, the Salvation Army exacts the hideous
poke-bonnet as a guarantee of good faith :
the Muckneillists declare that low-necked
dresses are an abomination in the sight
of the Lord. If they could, they would
cover up the women’s faces altogether, as in
Mohammedan countries, where (no doubt partly
as a consequence) every man obeys the mollah
and attends the mosque. For my own part, I
trust that Earth will continue to prevail, hold-
ing with Maitland that “ man is like a tree—
the deeper he strikes his roots into earth, the
higher he climbs towards heaven.” It gives me
great pleasure to see Woman keeping her end
up, whether in a ball-room or elsewhere, and
bearing her share of the cross which.has so fitly
been adopted as the supreme religious symbol.
—Yours, Brigham Brown, M.D., F.R.C.S.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Same Old Discrepancy.
A land-resumption case which made a fitful
appearance last week in the New South Wales
law-courts is about the strongest proof yet
offered of the need for a taxation system under
which every owner will value his own property,
pay tax on his own valuation, and be “ re-
sumed ” by the State—if the State feels so in-
clined—also on his own valuation. The matter
involved was 12 acres of land alongside the
railway line in the neighborhood of Mittagong.
A valuable quarry is included in the property,
and the railway commissioners proposed to take
it over for ballasting purposes. Their own
experts estimated the 12 acres at £l5OO, and
there is no evidence at present available that
this estimate didn’t express their conscientious
opinion of the value of the property. The
owner’s experts estimated it—no doubt quite as
conscientiously—at £209,000, or a little more
than 139 times the other experts’ valuation.
Then seven of the most expensive New South
Wales lawyers attended to argue the matter
out before a Judge and jury, and to call a
large amount of high-priced evidence, and
to accumulate legal expenses in a manner
dreadful to behold. The results of the
case have no bearing on the question
under discussion. The matter, as it affects
the community at large, is this: So long
as one crowd of experts is prepared, on its
solemn oath, to value a piece of land at £l5OO,
and another crowd is prepared to value the
same piece, on its equally solemn oath, at
£209,000, and the matter has then to be settled
by hiring several thousand pounds’ worth of
lawyers, who have no personal knowledge of
the value, to argue the matter before a Judge,
who is equally ignorant, and the final decision
rests with a jury which, in nine cases out of
ten, knows nothing at all about it, even after
hearing the evidence and arguments, so long
will the resumption of land for public purposes
continue to be a great and horrible fraud on the
State treasury. In the present instance, the
two lots of experts were a little wider apart in
their estimates than usual, but otherwise there
is no difference between this case and any
other. Two crowds of experts are always
equally positive ; the Judge and the jury have
only the testimony of the experts to go upon,
and there is absolutely no sure method of
arriving at the truth, even if there is any
definite truth to arrive at, which is by no means
certain. Also, if the truth should be arrived
at, it costs so much in legal expenses that it is
hardly worth having. Therefore, every poli-
tician who has the welfare of the country at
heart—if there are any such individuals—should
insist on embodying in the Land-tax Bill the
simple and efficient device, now employed in
Maoriland, whereby every land-holder values
his own property, and the State has the right
of resumption on the basis of his own valuation
if it considers his estimate too low, or it it
wants his estate for public purposes. Consider-
ing that the amount involved in the AmOs case,
apart from legal expenses, would probably be
equal to six months’ land-tax revenue for the
whole of New South Wales, on the anticipated
basis of Id. in the £, this proviso is quite as
important as is the land-tax itself.
A Storm Brewing.
The Victorian Assembly has decided in favour
of a tax on land-values, and with a majority of
14 supporting the main principles of his bill
Premier Turner should get it strengthened,
rather than weakened, in committee. There is
no loophole of escape for any bogus land-taxers
who may have voted with the majority in the
flesh, whilst siding with Fat Man in the spirit.
The only amendments possible under the cir-
cumstances will make things more unpleasant
for the typical stout gentleman aforesaid, so
now that the bill must pass he may be expected
to assist the “moderate parly ” in carrying the
original clauses. Those who hate the bill will
vote against nearly all the amendments. And
then ! The last hope of the Tories is expressed
with artless impudence by sundry up-country
publications and specially stupid members of
the Upper ’Ouse. The poor old Argus merely
talks about a general rising of the community
against a land-values tax, as though the com-
munity hadn’t recently risen for it. J. B.
Patterson delivers himself of the sphinxy pro-
phecy that “ it will never become law.” The
fatuous, frock-coated cormorants of Collins-st.
and Flinders Lane encourage the humble members
of their push to go around buzzing “ They’ll
never get it.” If asked to explain why Victoria
cannot move with the times, these wiseacres
smile as they were wont to smile two or three
months ago, when prognosticating a glorious
victory for Freetrade. They are discreetly
vague. But, by such authorities as T. Brunton,
M.L.0., and the Mount Alexander Mail, the
awful truth is bellowed forth. Brunton,
M.L.0., speaking for the Upper House, in-
formed a rural banquet, or a carefully-selected
shire luncheon, or some equally representative
gathering, that the Upper House would either
throw the iniquitous tax out of the Upper
House’s back door “ or lay it aside.” And the
Mount Alexander Mail, quoted by the Argus,
puts the conundrum to its 18 or more constant
readers, “ How can the Turner Government
I, .pe to force the tax on unimproved
1,i,1 I-values through the Council, even by
a tack ? ” There is a wild idea in
the air that the Council can finally reject a
Budget, or, easier still, “ lay it aside ” and go
on snoring as before. Which idea is born of
Tory faith in its Council’s determination to die
fighting the land-tax if necessary. Much yalu-
able time would be lost before the political
destruction of Bbunton, William Clarke, and
the rest of them was satisfactorily accom-
plished, and herein lies the Upper House s hope
of a compromise. The country would have to
wait for financial legislation of urgent import-
ance whilst its Parliamentary system was
getting reconstructed. The Bruntonites, if
they have a majority, will back Time against
the land-tax, and. after compelling the tax to
pay forfeit, they will await the almost certain
punishment of death with a martyr smile on
their capitalistic countenances.
Boodlewraith. Floats a Loan.
As anticipated in a recent Bulletin, Queens-
land Government has sprung a new loan upon
the province in almost the last week of the
Parliamentary session. Only a week before
Premier Nelson told the public that —
I think it advisable at the present moment to avoid
b't rowing more money. In the interests of the colony it
will be wise for a session, at any rate, to abstain from
goi ig to the English public to ask for the loan of further
sums of money.
Eight days passed ; Parliament was within a
week of prorogation ; and Treas. Nelson came
down to the Assembly and demanded authority
for a .£2,000,000 loan. It is explained that
there is a vital difference between borrowing
money for public works —to which the
Treasurer referred in his quoted utterance —
and borrowing money to wipe out Treasury
Bills—-to which he refers at present. In the
one case, it seems, you impair the credit of the
province ; in the other case you strengthen its
credit by showing investors how honestly you
are striving to pay your debts—by floating
another IO U. Thanks to the “ heaven-born
financing” of MTlwbaith, Nelson, and Co.,
Queensland has accumulated (as per the
Auditor-General’s last report) a revenue deficit
of ,£1,674,686. This has been wiped out in the
public ledger by selling land for ,£274,064, and
by borrowing .£1,400,622 on Treasury Bills.
The Govt, now proposes to convert £1,128,400
of bills into inscribed stock, with a 40 years’ cur-
rency —that is, it deliberately refuses to meet its
obligations, and shunts the losses of its bungled
finance on to the shoulders of the Queenslanders
of 1935. A more dishonest proposal was never
submitted to any Australian Parliament. So
far, every Govt, has recognised its responsibility
of making revenue meet expenditure. But the
chronic necessities of Boodlewraith banks have
choked whatever sense of responsibility Q. Govt,
possesses. It sets the precedent of wiping out
deficits by long-dated promissory notes ; and, so
long as the notes are taken up, Boodlewraith’s
troubles about repayment! The Queensland
National Bank, in which many members of
the Govt, party are deeply interested as
directors, or shareholders, or depositors, has
nominally upwards of £3,000,000 of Govt,
money on hand; and if the projected loan is
floated it will have upwards of £5,000,000. In
addition to the Treasury Bills, the new loan
provides £765,000 to take up old stock, and
£106,000 is set apart to meet expected flotation
charges (the loss on the last loan of £1,182,400
was £168,167 !) £1,265,000 of liabilities falls
due on Ist January, 1896—75 months 0ff—
£228,000 on Ist April, 1896—76 months off—
ami £400,000 on Ist July, 1896—79 months off.
Yet Treasurer Nelson considers it imperatively
necessary to float his loan at once and saddle
the province with double interest, from a year
to a year and a-half before the money is publicly
needed !
A Meeting of Victoria’s Creditors.
Victobia called a meeting of her creditors last
week in re an outstanding debt of £73,000; but,
for once in the history of the province, a divi-
dend of one farthing in the pound was not
accepted. This debt is part of Patterson’s
scheme of preferential repudiation, submitted
to the country under the alias Retrenchment.
Patterson, on his own motion, held back
£73,000 due to the public servants, and the
amount is still outstanding, and could be re-
covered by process of law. The Age, pre-
sumably inspired, suggested voluntary abandon-
ment of the debt, and H. N. P. Wollaston,
Secretary for Customs, called a meeting of
public servants for the said purpose. Mr.
Wollaston took the horse to the water, and it
kicked him in. Under the guidance of a young
man eloquent, one Harry Dagleish, the meet-
ing spurned Mr. Wollaston, icfused to con-
sider his proposal, and remitted the question
to Parliament. The Victorian Parliament has
already “ retrenched ” the Service twice,
so Mr. Dagleish probably acted on the idea
that lightning does not strike three times in the
same place. His notion was, however, as much
as possible politic and as little as possible
politics, and so served its purpose. A few days
before this meeting, that fulsome person, Frank
Madden, declared, out of the abundance of his
ignorance, that Victoria was within measurable
distance of asking time to pay her creditors;
and, on the same day, a few hours previous,
Premier Turner, speaking with knowledge,
announced Victoria’s two alternatives a
Land - tax or Repudiation. There is no
dilemma here. The Victorian people are
ready to adopt the Land : tax, and abandon
all peddling schemes for filching pence from the
pockets of the public servants. The Land-tax
is not a blow at anything but monopoly, which
takes all and gives nothing—while the public
servants give at least some return for their
salaries.
♦
Fading Away.
The acceptance by Premier Turner (Vic.) of
the challenging motion of a private member-
unrecognised as the leader of any party —as a
vote of want of confidence, inherently taking
precedence of all other Parliamentary business,
is a sign that party government, “ Government
by Contradiction,” is slowly dying of a compli-
cation of diseases. By the precedents of party
government, Turner’s orthodox course would
have been to treat M‘Kenzie’s motion with
scorn, by classing what purported to be a
mortal challenge as an ordinary motion and
leaving it to take its chances on the routine
business paper, without swerving a hair’s-
breadth from the announced Government pro-
gramme. Precedents die hard usually. Wheu
they are departed from, almost as a matter ol
course, as in the case under consideration, the
interpretation of the sign—generally ignored
because it is an ordinary fact under
everybody’s vision —is that the systen
of which the precedents formed a part it
breaking towards dissolution. The acceptancd
of M'Kenzie’s motion, as if M‘Kenzie were the
recognised leader of the Victorian Opposition,
is tantamount to a denial of Patterson, the
acknowledged chief of that Opposition. Hie
denial of the chief means the denial of the
party. The denial of the party involves, in the
course of future progression, the denial of the
system of “ Government by Contradiction.
Evolutionary prophecy already sees the foetus
taking shape in the womb of the future—a
Premier and Minister balloted for separ-
ately and for set terms (with a proviso
for expulsion under certain circumstances), and
any Parliamentary nobody challenging ad-
ministrative proposals without necessarily
endangering the tenure of the adminis-
tration, or even of any individual administrator.
In those days, the grave of the monster Govern-
ment by Coalition will be five hundred fathoms
deep.
Politics and Perjury.
The squalid meanness of Party Government
was never better demonstrated than by the
stand which the Dibbs party is making against
the New South Wales Land and Income-tax
Bill. That same party, when it was in power,
tried to etiforce similar taxes, and the present
Reid crowd, or as much of it as was then in
Parliament, mostly viewed the proposition with
horror. Now the Reid crowd is running the
scheme, and the Dibbs crowd—which, if it had
any brains at all, would simply congratulate
its enemies on their conversion, and shove the
bill along, on the ground that it is its own bill
—takes its turn at regarding the scheme with
horror. Neither party, in the main, is sincere,
and the party which is lying on one side of the
question would lie quite as effusively on the
other if the occasion demanded. In fact, each
party has lied effusively on both sides of the
question already, and has an unlimited capacity
for keeping on doing so. And the country is
so used to this blatant selfishness that it
isn’t at all impressed. Party Govern-
ment admittedly exists for the purpose
of shoving the party into office, therefore it is
a recognised thing that the Ministerial party
should support the Ministerial proposals what-
ever they may be, and that the Opposition
should oppose them, whatever they may be.
And when, through a not infrequent turn of
circumstances, one gang is required to cheer
wildly for the scheme which it regarded (when
in Opposition) with disgust, and the other one
is required to utterly loathe the infamous pro-
posals which (when it wasn’t in Opposition) it _
enthusiastically advocated, the public is so
accustomed to the situation that it entirely
fails to see the naked infamy of it.
In the Victorian no-confidence debate last week,
Wheeler, M.P., rose when the clock said past
midnight to oppose the taxon unimproved land-
values. That very afternoon he accompanied
a deputation to urge a tax on the unearned
increment on sheep :
Mr. Wheeler ask-d that the Govt, should introduce a
bill authorising the formation of a trust which would be
empowered to levy a tax of 2s. for every 100 sheep in the
province, for the purpose of getting funds to carry on the
export trade in frozen mutton Unless this
was done some of the owners of sheep who would derive a
benefit by the export of mutton relieving a glutted market
and so sending up the price of sheep would not contribute
anything towards the enterprise, and it was to avoid
them getting an unfair advantage that this course was
suggested. It was felt that all those who would obtain a
benefit from the export trade should contribute towards
the establishment of that trade. As an instance of what
the development of this trade had done so far.it was
stated that since mutton had been exported from here
during the lust few months longwool merinoes had ad-
vanced Is. per head, and this advantage was being derived
mostly by owners of large Hocks of sheep who had not
assisted the export industry in any way.
With almost trifling changes this speech would
do for advocacy of the land-tax. Wheeler’s
opposition to the land-tax iu the early morning
can therefore be pub down to sleepiness.
One and all of the approvers of the drastic
(seven-year) sentences passed by N.S.W. Chief
Justice Darlev on the Momba and Kallara
shearers, base their judgment on the principle
that the crimes imputed to the accused were as
heinous committed when and where they were
as if committed at any time anywhere. The
Court stated this principle in exact terms, and
the daily Press, taking up the words, hammered
out an apparently reasonable deduction. But,
first, should any human act, virtuous or crimi-
nal, be, in estimating its true value, dissociated
from its surroundings? Momba and Kal-
lara were in the throes of an aggravated
trade-strike, and partisans on both sides
were charged with feelings which goaded
to violence. This does not excuse the
perpetrators of outrage, but it should be mani-
fest that it enters into every dispassionate
attempt to calculate the actual guilt of the
accused, and into every sane attempt to appor-
tion adequate punishment. In the next place,
does not this chorus of approval rise from the
very crowd of persons who argue day after day
that certain bank swindlers should be released
from gaol, on the ground that their offences
against the law were perpetrated at a time of
abnormal financial excitement ? If it is right to
regard the crimes of those financiers through
the atmosphere of the time, whatever difference
may exist as to the amount of the influence
thus exercised ; why should the disturbing in-
fluence of a bitter strike be expressly excluded
when offending shearers are the theme ?
John Burns, of Battersea, in an excellent in-
terview printed in the N.Q. Herald, joins The
Bulletin in detesting Samuel Smiles, the
shoddy little god of shoddy little worshippers.
“No good,” remarks Burns, “comes of the
eternal precepts showered upon us by the
fatuous Smiles school advocating emulation and
the life-long struggle to outdo your fellows.

“ The Streets of London,” which spreads
its lachrymose dimensions over the stage at
Sydney Royal, may almost claim the honor of
being the most weepful drama of the present day.
It is full of tears and lamentations and damp with
unutterable grief. The heroine lies on a thorny
bed of care all through four desolate acts, and
gaunt hunger sits on her threshold, and woe gib-
bers at her in her dreams and in her awakening.
The beginning of the story is obviously an adapta-
tion of Charles Reade’s “Hard Cash,” an air of
originality being lent to the new version by the
wicked banker scooping £30,000 instead of £14,000,
and the captain dying in the presence of Badger
instead of going mad in the presence of Skinner.
From this point, however, it roams away into
paths of its own, and all resemblance to anything
is lost. All the really good people get out on the
streets and wander round in black, weeping
bitterly, with their hair down, and looking vainly
for a crust. They lose their billets and never find
any other ones, and as the natural consequences
they go for unprecedented periods without food,
and think bitter thoughts about mother. The
heroine, dressed in black as aforementioned,
becomes almost too feeble to articulate, and
can hardly lie down without holding on
with both hands, and the prevailing impres-
sion is that she hasn’t had any dinner for
eleven weeks. Her brother reposes at full length
in the street for 45 minutes from sheer exhaus-
tion. The banker’s accomplice sells matches fora
living, and the heroine’s lover pawns his overcoat
and lives on baked-potatoes. Even the baked-
potato-man is sold up three times by the same
wicked banker. And all this while the accom-
plice, Badger, has a document in his pocket with
which he can bring the banker to the dust at any
moment, but every time, when he is just on the
point of getting there, something unexpected hap-
pens to overthrow Badger and postpone his ven-
geance. And when, at last, the document is
produced, all the hungry victims who have been
weeping in the streets for years past rise up and
forgive the banker, after all, for the utterly irrele-
vant reason that he “loves his daughter,” The
most picturesque characters in the east are Alfred
Woods, as Badger ; Miss Vivienne, as the princi-
pal weepist in the streets; and Miss Austin Eliot,
as the banker’s hard-faced daughter. These people
all do remarkably good work, and the others
do nothing in particular, and do it in no
particular fashion. A widow and a duke, who
appear on the bill, don’t transpire in the flesh at
all ; and a well-staged conflagration is somewhat
marred by the fact that the lachrymose people,
who are living in a cottage out in the country, see
the blaze, in the very far distance, and at once
recognise that it is at 219 J Cross-street, White-
chapel, or something of the sort, that the banker
is the incendiary, and that he is trying to burn
the document. This awful certainty about the
odd half in the street number is dispiriting.

•“ Ransom,” G. Rignold’s latest effort,
holds an honorable position among melodramas,
inasmuch as it is less confused than the ordinary
melodrama, and doesn’t outrage time and space,
and the haggard head of anachronism doesn’t
glare too conspicuously among the flowers. It is
a romance of an ideal selector, in the person of
Scot Inglis, with Miss Athena Claudius for his
ideal wife, living in an ideal homestead in the
bush. There are no unkempt children about that
homestead, no goats, no pigs rooting in the
garden, and no hens climbing on the kitchen-
table, nor has the family horse come in and rubbed
his tongue over the salt-cellar, and the whole hired
staff consists of bright little Dora Mostyn, as an
ideal boy. To prove that he is an ideal boy, this
boy is made to deliver an impassioned address
concerning the Melb. Cup. But the shadow of
the wicked squattah is over the ideal homestead.
The squattah wants Miss Claudius to be the
flower of his harem, and he arranges the cap-
ture of her husband by bushrangers. These
outlaws demand a ransom of .£3OO, or else
they will hang their captive’s handsome head
by a strong string upon a tree, and the
squattah puts up the money on condition
that Min* Claudius will be his’n in return. Her
husband being saved, that lady goes forth weeping
to deliver herself up to the squatbah as a burnt-
offering in a gully, but the ideal boy and the
selector get there before her and bang her enemy
considerably against a tree. The selector also
comes into a fortune and pays off his debt to the
immoral pastoralist, and as he is going out after
getting his receipt a bushranger comes in and
shoots the man of wool and beeves. Naturally
that vast and boundless ass, the law, interferes
just here and sends the ideal selector to Berrima
for life, but things are cleared up later on, and he
is left embracing his wife on his own freehold
property.
• • •
Outside this story there runs another
wholly irrelevant tale about a stout lady who has
come to Australia to reduce her fat, her trodden-
on husband, her daughter who won’t “ hold her-
self up,” and a new-chum. The new-chum is
hereby consigned to oblivion, but the stout lady,
in the capable hands of Miss Kate Bishop, is the
best character in the drama. Dora Mostyn’s ideal
boy is also a refreshing oasis; Dora is bright and
pretty and decidedly impressive in her pants and
tall boots, and she sings rather nicely. Scot
Inglis—who doesn’t sing, by the way—is a parti-
cularly fine selector ; and—with the exception of
the new-chum aforesaid, one or two of the bush-
rangers, and a long, stork-like personage in the
medical profession everybody fits his part
admirably. The sight of Miss Claudius arriving
on horseback with the ransom is in itself worth
threepence of the admission money, if not more.

At Sydney Lyceum, the “ Foundling” has
been gradually remaining about the same as
before. There is so little to be ri ,ne with the
unpromising materials on hand that, this result is
only what might have been expected. Opinions
differ a good deal as to whether the co. or the
comedy is most at fault. The Bulletin's opinion
is that they are eminently worthy of each other;
the comedy is a dreary and confused affair, and half
theco. could well besent back again to England with
advantage, and its place filled with local talent.
One gladsome piece of news is that the “Found-
ling” will retire this week to make room for
“Jones,” which goes up on Saturday. “ Jones ”
is by Arthur Shirley, the author of sundry gore-
draggled dramas, but it is alleged to be a bright
farcical-comedy none the less. At all events its
name is a recommendation, although Shirley
possibly selected it because it rhymed so pleasantly
with “ bones ” and “groans.”

Edison’s kinetoscope (on view at 148 Pitt-
street, Sydney) is the newest entertainment at
present in Sydney. Outwardly, the kinetoscope
looks like a mildly-glorified peep show, but it
differs from the peep-show in exactly the same
way a runaway horse differs from a sausage.
The figures keep moving all the time, and move
as naturally as they do in real life. The pride
and glory of the present collection is the skirt-
dancer, who is probably the best of her kind
yet seen in Australia. Her high-kicking is a
thing of beauty; and her bright~smile, and her
waving draperies, and the airy boundings of her
two small feet, make the spectator long to burst
into the instrument and embrace this vision Sin.
long. The other pictures cover a variety of sub-
jects. A free and independent cock-fight, in
which the smaller rooster wins, is another
vigorous spectacle; but the most desperate
shindy in the collection is a wrestling match,
in which one combatant is thrown six
times in as many seconds, and is several
times lifted up and thrown right over his
opponent’s head. There are unlimited possibilities
in the kinetoscope. It ought to be owned by an
immensely wealthy syndicate, which could send
agents all over the world to photograph prize-
fights, duels, Chinese executions (especially by the
process of cutting into ten thousand slices), fires,
murders, hangings, sinking ships, railway ac-
cidents, Nautch dances, corroborees, coronations,
battles, riots, proposals of marriage, and all
manner of interesting subjects. When this is
done the instrument can be made to show the
history of the world, and anyone can drop in and
see whatever has been happening lately. An
execution, for example, is heavy reading in five
columns of the boy-reporter’s eloquence, but the
kinetoscope could show the whole thing, from the
entrance of the criminal to the inquest, in five
minutes, and not leave out a single detail.

Maggie Moore’s season at Melb. Royal
appears to be going as strong as ever, if not
more so. It is a large house to fill during these
drowsy weeks of waiting for Xmas to come, but
the masses roll up and fill it every night. On
Saturday, “The Child of the Regiment” was
produced for the first time in Melbourne by the
present company, and Maggie Moore’s imper-
sonation of that dashing militairess excited a
£ood deal of wonder as to why she hadn’t done
it before on the same boards. “The Child of
the Regiment” is a joyously impossible yarn
under any circumstances. M. M. makes the
most of the joy and the least of the impos-
sibility. Also, she manages the operatic music
of the part with much ingenuity, and the result
of her exertions is a general opinion that the
curtain falls too soon. On Wednesday, a fare-
well revival of “The Colleen Bawn ” was to
start. Other revivals will follow at brief inter-
vals, until the management get to “Struck Oil,”
after which—the pantomime.

“Nitouche” is now concluding her success-
ful razzle-dazzle at the Princess’s. Persons
desirous of sampling the calm serenity of convent
life, and see ng a nun accept a chaste salute, must
hurry up. The Comic Opera Co. sails for Maori-
land on Dec. 19, and a full list of meantime-ar-
rangements has been drawn up. On Saturday
(Dec. 8) and two following nights—not reckoning
the Sawbath—Ma Mie Rosette will carry milk to
the king’s chateau in her dream, and a second
edition of Living Pictures will follow. Three per-
formances of Sirbill Robinson’s “ Predatoroa,”
supported by the pictures aforesaid, are to test the
loyalty of theatre-goers from Dec. 12 to 14. Then
comes “La Cigale.” with Nellie Stewart in the
name part for the first time, an event that is looked
forward to with burning interest.

There is nothing new to say about
“ Morocco Bound,” at the- Bijou, except that the
music-hall scene is made more cheerful than of
yore by the introduction of variety artists, and
that the show has got to its last nights. The
question as to whether “Morocco Bound ” is very
amusing all through, or merely a little bit funny
every now and then, is no nearer a settlement now
than it was at the beginning.

Cogill Bros, are keeping up a fine average
prosperity at the Oxford all this while. Also, our
old friend “Elijah”—who deserves mention in
this connection because he was a steady prophet—
is announced for Monday next at the Town Hall.
“Elijah” is intended as a complimentary welcome
to J ulius Herz.

Mrs. Annie Besant gave her last lecture in
Adelaide Town Hall on Tuesday evening, and
next day sailed per mail for India. In all the
considerable cities of Australia and Maoriland she
attracted large audiences ; and, except in Victoria,
she did not visit any up-country town. Geelong,
of course, held aloof from a speaker who reproached
a Philistine clergy with their lack of spirituality ;
but many of the best men of Ballarat went with
their wives to hear the most eloquent of living
women. Outside her oratorical gifts, Mrs. Besant
is a remarkable woman and a great worker. The
nightly lecture was only a small part of her daily
task. From 11 to 2 every day she used to meet
inquirers in public, and later in the afternoon she
gave interviews to occultists. What leisure she
had left was devoted to letter-writing, her corre-
spondents living in all parts of the globe. She
got on very well with R. S. Smythe and his son,
doubtless feeling that, but for their management,
she would have addressed hundreds instead of
thousands.
At Poverty Point.
A star actress, who lately visited Australia, raised Cain
one evening over a performance of “Camille.” In the
last act, when Camille bids farewell to Armand, she pre-
sents him with her photo., which she states is said to be
very like her. Being “realistic,” this particular star
would insist upon the presence of the real article, when-
ever possible, even at rehearsal, and several times
remarked, “ Now, Mr. So-and-so, this is my photo.
Imagine that you are speaking to and looking at me.”
On toe evening in question the property-man gave
Camille the photo., as he thought, of herself, but, when
her ladyship presented the pasteboard, Armand broke
out into a broad grin, which quite spoilt the scene. The
photo, was one of “Japanese Tommy.”
A young and popular actress, whose Galatea is
st:ll fresh in Australian public memory, had the
prettiest scene in the piece once spoilt for her in a
very peculiar way. Just after completing the setting of
the scene the property-man could not, for the life of him
discover the stuffed kid that did duty for the fawn.
Something had to be done, and remembering that some
people living near the theatre were the possessors of a
very .young kid he borrowed it, and rushing with it to a
neighbouring chemist had the animal chloroformed;
quickly returning to the theatre he gave it from the
wings to Lucippe, who afterwards surrendered it to
Galatea. At the moment of Galatea’s w eeping over the
dead fawn, the kid, recovering from the chloroform,
raised its head and, opening its eyes in bleary style,
baa'd out in a decidedly drunken fashion. With the
stubbornness of its kind the animal would persist in giving
expression to its views of the proceedings, and amidst
roars from the audience Pygmalion's best girl abruptly
ended the scene.
Miss Marcella Day, of Melbourne, has unearthed a new
danger to newspaper proprietors by suing the Aob and
Arous for damages on account of an alleged libel in a
certain advt. Miss Marcella appeared at Melb. Alexandra
one Saturday night under Inigo Tyrrell's ill-fated manage-
ment, and sang three songs in a, it is said, more or less pain-
ful manner. The burden of one ditty (from “ Madame
Favart ") was “She is such an artless thing.” Tyrrell’s
business advt. on Monday morning included these words:
" Miss Day will also take ‘ a night off.’ She is such an
artless thing, tra-la-la.” Which, notwithstanding the
malice they expressed to the initiated few, might have
meant that the young lady was being put forward as a
special attraction, for all that a newspaper editor or any
other person ignorant of Marcella's alleged failure could
fairly suspect to the contrary. This libel-action, which
fizzled ingloriously, reminds one of the “chops and
tomato-sauce ” incident in the case of Bardell v. Pick-
wick.
The critics, remarks The Bulletin’s London corres-
pondent, have been very kind to Alfred Dumpier and
“ Robbery Under Arms,” just produced at the Princess’s.
Alfred put all he knew into the leading character, whilst
Herbert Flemming was a manly and vigorous Dick
Mars to n. Charles Achurch Charrington got special leave
from Janet to play a desperado, which he did to the
satisfaction of the gallery. He gave full vent to his
voice, and stormed and raved after the most approved
maimer of stage bushrangers. Anna Face-lotion Ruppert
gave a charming interpretation of Starlight’s devoted
Aileen, and what gave even more pleasure than her act-
ing was her appearance on a milk-white palfrey which she
bestrode with much grace. Clarence Holt got a rare
reception, and showed how melodrama should he played
—no mealy-mouthed business, sir, but your real old
Astley’s form. “Robbery Under Arms” should draw
money to pit and gallery, but it will not be a lasting
success. However, Dampier made a good entry on the
London boards, and that is something.
“There is some talk of the formation of a ‘powerful
syndicate ’ to undertake the business of carting out first-
class companies to Australia to play the latest London
successes, in the best style, for a season in Melbourne and
Sydney only. It is hoped that—with the exception of,
perhaps, the actor-manager himself—the original cast will
he secured and special scenery and accessories provided.
The names of some well-known dramatists are mentioned
in connection with the proposal, for there is considerable
dissatisfaction as to the way plays are being run in this
country. Pinero is said to be much displeased with the
financial result of ‘The Second Mrs. Tanqueray.’ ’’
The Pall Mall Gazette man jumps on Captain Star-
light, and jibes at the “Simple people like the Austra-
lians,” who are alleged (by the management) to think
“Robbery Under Arms” a good melodrama. It was
advertised as a phenomenally successful show in its own
country, and as such it is abused by the cynical cockney,
who “likes to know the taste of Australians in these
matters.” In short, the P.M.G. revels in it* dire ignorance
of the public that is catered for by Williamson and Mus-
grove and Brough and Boucioaulfc. A Sydney or Mel-
bourne newspaper might, with as much reason, judge
British taste by one of D in Barry's “ latest London sensa-
tions,” but. we never find a simple Australian journalist
making quite such an ass of himself. Mr. Dumpier, says
P.M.’G., “ lacked vigor and sauntered through his part, as
if it bored him.’* That's fair comment, unhappily. The
actor suffers from a physical ailment which 'makes him
saunter, hut this slow method seems generally acceptable.
As long as he doesn’t rush through his parts and bore
other people, like Lonnen, all is well.
London D.T. deals gently with Alfred Dampier and his
stage version of “ Robbery Under Arms,” at the local
Princess’. “To some the play may be a little noisy, to
others too diffuse, hut on the whole it is healthy, sound,
and m inly, and, if it happens to please a crowded cheap
audience, who would willingly deprive such playgoers of
an innocent evening’s amusement?” Dampier gets praise
for his pleasing voice and “manner of n cultured gentle-
man,” and is said to remind the critic of Henry Neville—
which is about the nicest compliment that can be honestly
paid him, as it happens. There it a something of
Neville in Dampier, although the old London actor uses
his musical voice to more purpose with less effort.
Tenor Tapley, not being on in “ Mam’zelle Nitouche,”
and being a bit of a politician, stayed in Vic. Legislative
Assembly while the no-confidence motion was being
debated, from 4.30 p.m. till 2.15 next morning, with but a
short interval for refreshments. But where was Mrs. Vi
Varley-Tapley all this lime? And did the dear little
woman sternly enquire, “Where have you been, Joseph?’’
Edith Courtney, whose funny imitation of the society

Editor Bulletin, —I consider that the living-picture, or ■
rather statue-show, given some three or four years ago .at
Melb. Opera House by the Silbon-Stirk combination, was
a far more artistic and pleasing exhibition than the much-

more symmetrical, and the males, which some damsel ;

Dear Bulletin, —May I ask, through your columns, if
any visitor to the Tivoli has remarked the contemptuous
attitude assumed by the “ lady serio-comiques ” and the

The Bulletin Christmas Number, to be
published Dec. 15, will be original from cover to

The following paragraph appeared in lasfr
issue of The Bulletin :
A Dubho boy, at boarding-school in Sydney, disliking
the treatment accorded him by the head-master, stole out
of the dormitory one night, with eight shillings in his
pocket, faced the 300 miles that lay before him, and
trudged home in five weeks.
We are informed that the head-master regards the
paragraph as conveying that the pupil was forced
away by ill-treatment. As The Bulletin had
never the slightest intention of conveying any
such insinuation it tenders its apology to the head-
master if, in his opinion, any such meaning is
capable of being attached to the paragraph.
The defeat of Mr. John Hughes, for
Fitzroy Ward, Sydney, last Saturday, by Mr, F,
Penny, means that the somewhat inconsequential I
Mr. Sammy Lees is to be the next Mayor of;
Sydney. Mr. Hughes’ defeat is chiefly due toj
three causes : that he refused to pledge himself to
vote for making Mr. Lees mayor; that he had in-
curred the great displeasure of the big landowners
and contractors by getting the second lot of
Market-site excavations done by day-work instead
of by contract (his action in this regard having
been the means of many hundreds of pounds going

The primitive Aryan man wore a rag tied round

day goes to Smith and Son’s, of 302 George-street,
Sydney, and invests in one of the new Japanese
straws—the lightest, newest and most elegant
kind of skull-gear in the market. Or he can take
his choice among the tennis hats, boating hats,
Terai hats, soft hats, hard hats, cork hats, bell-
toppers, and innumerable other varieties. Every
kind of hat that was ever seen by the eyes of man,
or heard of with his ears, or dreamt of in the
visions of his head upon his bed, can be obtained
from Messrs. Smith and Son at the lowest price ;
together with gold and silver mounted umbrellas,
all other kinds of umbrellas, caps, walking-sticks,
puggaries, and the like frivolities.

It is whispered—and denied by a manufacturer
that the buying of Australian-grown tohacoo-leaf isin the:
hands of a ring. That is why, it is said, tobacco-growing
is not profitable, and why the local article is only
smoked on compulsion. But even if not so, what can be
expected when a manufacturer admits that the only good
tobacco district in Victoria is worked solely by Chinese
tenants? Tenants of whom? The answer would possibly
solve the ring question.
♦ * • •
The Vie. Tariff Commission should, before it
ceases, ascertain whether any Victorian tobacco is sold as
American ; whether any American firm has branches here
and manufactures from Australian leaf, and whether it
put its American trade-mark on tobacco made here from
American or Australian leaf; why it is almost impossible
to get good plugs of a once good black tobacco ; whether
sunflower leaves or other such substiutes are used for
tobacco-leaf ; and whether good and bad (there are no
middlings, the makers admit, in the “colonial” trade)
pieces are ever pressed together intone plug.

A heavy drop has taken place in A.J.S.

pay a 10 per cent. div. in the Melb. state of affairs, then
optimism must he at an eternal discount. But, according
to Walter Madden’s political position, it is only civil-

Farnham Park, Warrnambool (Vic,), was sold
last week to prove that land has no value in Victoria.
The first bid for the first lot was £2O an acre, and the suc-
cessful bid was £35 15s. an acre ; 100 acres went at £2O to
£25 ; 335 acres at £25 to £3O ; 136 acres at about £35 ; 5
acres at £7l. And yet there is no unearned increment to
be taxed, and no means of paying the tax, and no way to
estimate it! The upset price of the first lot was £26, or
£9 15s. under the realised price. The principal pur-
chasers were the “ .oor farmers ” of the district, against
whom Melbourr ,‘nd Maoriland buyers could not con-

There are already six methods of going bung in
Victoria without the publicity of bankruptcy. Still
another plan is now adopted, but so far by the rag
trade only. A private meeting of the creditors agrees to
secretly “write off,” say, 10s. in £, and allow the trader
to carry on as though nothing had happened. Supporters
who are not “ in the know” continue to give long terms
to the trader, whilst those who were "in” before take
care to deal for cash in 14 days only. When the trader
again goes bung, in the old-fashioned way, the outsiders
are “ in ” and insiders are “ out,” after making sufficient
profit between the two busts to compensate for the 10s.

Ugly rumours are afloat up North respecting a
well-known Australian firm in the trade-liquidation line.
It is possible the matter may not become public, as more
than one big mercantile firm has been privy to the
swindle, which consists of the assignee invariably doubling
and trebling the amount of certain confederate traders’
legitimate claims on certain estates assigned to the firm
for realisation. Outsiders' claims are, of course, put in at
the right amount and their dividends are diminished,
whilst the conspiring merchant and assignee whack up
100 to 200 per cent, more in the shape of dividend than
they are really entitled to.

F.: “Friend ‘M‘G.’ seems very anxious for
new shillings. He says we don’t see new silver nowadays.
As a matter of fact the new designs in British silver coin
are not circulating in Vic. yet, but pathless the cur-
rency is all right. Anyhow, supposing ‘ M‘G.’ gets ss. a
week, he should only see one 1894 coin in a month,
according to the arithmetic of the thing. A shilling
theoretically lasts about 20 years, so that the coins issued
before ’74 should now, for the most part, he out of circu-
lation. But hoarded and lost coins crop up every now
and again to interfere with the rule. I examine seven
coins left in my pocket by Fate. The dates are ’79, ’79,
'79, ’77, ’72, ’B6, 'BB. Are these new enough for * M‘G. ?’
The tendency of the banks is to keep the best silver in
their strongholds. They over-purchased silver in the
boom and now have a mass of it idle ; as a consequence,
silver with current dates is not imported.
“ Regarding old sovereigns in circulation.
Before my last remarks I scanned a draft of 47 sovereigns
got in the ordinary way of business at the National Bank,
Melb. The lot oontaii ed one old Sydney sovereign (straw-
colored because of its silver contents) dated 1856. There
were no coins of the sixties. There were four of the
seventies, and ten of the eighties. ’9O to '92 contributed
10 coins, and there were eight dated ’93, and 14 dated '94.
We may call the ’93 and ’94 coins brand-new, and their
percentage would be 50 per cent, (about) of the whole.”

The dirtiness of Australian bank-notes is un-

with a clean note outside, and the germs get another

Dear Bulletin, —Your par. re Mdb. Wool-
brokers’ Association is slightly incorrect. Facts as fol-
low ;—The woolbuyers have lately decided not to attend
any sales not conducted in the Wool Exchange ; as in the
bustle of the wool season they lose too much time travel-
ling between the various rooms. The Wool Exchange is
leased by the Woolbrokers’ Association, consequently they
have the power to exclude any firm which is not a member,
and does not accept their scale of selling charges. In
fact, they could raise their commission much higher if
they chose, and compel the woolgrower to pay (hat rate
if he sold locally, simply because wool-sales not held under
their auspices would, as matters now stand, have no com-
petition. The buyers do not care, as they are not affected
in the least—they merely wish to study their own con-
venience in attending one central mart. The outside co.
to whom you refer had no alternative but to join, in the
interests of its own business. It is monstrous that the
principal industry of the province should be thus arbi-
trarily controlled by a few firms hack'd by English capi-
tal, who grind divs. out of the producer. Most of the so-
called squatters are only unpaid managers, and their
wool is mortgaged to the big firms aforesaid, who have
the right to sell it themselves. The worst of it is that
now the free man has to submit to the same charges as
the man who is mortgaged. Here is an example of trades-
unionism from the very people who try to crush the
shearers. What about their boasted freedom cf contract?
Can you suggest a remedy ?—Yours, Unreconstructed.

Thomas El’is and Muntz, of the late lamented

on Friday. Neither of them has paid, or is likely to pay,

discharge bv proving that they were the victims of un-
misfortune—which they didn’t do. Judge
Holro.vd, however, said that he was “bound by the Full
Court’s recent decision in the case of Matthew Davies,”
and granted both applications. Matthew is a man of
far-reaching consequences, and hecanse he got his certi-
ficate it appears that every other boomer is to do like-
wise. The law requiring an insolvent to pay 7s. in the 6
to his creditors, or show good cause why he can’t do it,
may now be regarded as abolished, so far as concerns
large, influential bankrupts. Mat. Davies found the
statute in his way, and repealed it in his own calm,

Editor Bulletin, —In a par. in your issue of
22nd Nov. you say that Mr. Christmas, who tried the

to a failure.” From this it might he inferred that the
Christmas process was a failure. Let me say that I
obtained the stone sent on for trial, and that Mr. Christmas
failed to obtain more than about 6dwt. to the ton. As this
did not altogether satisfy those connected with the mine, I
obtained a second lot of stone and had a sample of it
assayed —the result of which was a little over 6dwt. The
remainder was put through “The Christmas Metal
Extractor” and the result obtau ed was about the same
as results of assay. So far, all tests have been most
satisfactory, and, under the circumstances, it will cost
under 4dwt. per ton to work the machine. Results are

in Victoria, where the inventor is working both patents :

which at the bottom of his podge he hankers for.
Yet it cannot be exactly pleasant to Downing-
street to be told that its attitude to Australia is
one of “Quaker-like forbearance,” “almost
deferential.” George goes un to say that the oidy
strain on the Imperialistic “painter” will come
in war-time, and exhorts Rosebery and Salisbury
to see that their quarrel is good “in the sight of
heaven,” —Georgey is a parson’s son—otherwise
they will get no help from Australia.
From a recent number of Answers (Lon-
don) ?
Mr. Francis Abigail is, in many respects, a remarkab'e
man. Born in Hi-hnpsga!e half a century ago, he lost lis
father at 1(5 years of age, and the Inn , lame and scarcely
able to read and write, had to make his own way in the
world. This he has most successfully accomplish d. in-
got apprenticed to the boot-lasting trade, hut l> fore hi
time expired he resolved to go to Australia. Thi ty ree
years ago he landed in Sydney with a sick hroiher ;• d
the proverbial sixpence. In IS9O he visited th ■ old
country for the first time since he left these shores ; hut
he returned as an influential member cf the New South
Wales Parliament, an ex-Minister of the Crown, the prin-
cipal of a large commercial house, and Ihe chairman of
many important companies. Truly a noble example of
what industry, combined with brains, can achieve over all
obstacles.
And now ! Alas for poor Abigail and his vain
endeavors to break gaol! Truly, as Emile
Souvestre says, “one can outlive everything but a
good reputation.”
The Brisbane J’s.P. over ruled Police-
Magistrate Finuock’s refusal of bail to the men
concerned in the alleged labor kidnapping case at
Brisbane. The J.’sP. were possibly rig! *• for
papa P. is getting past work. Neverthelets, the
“cheap’’-beak system is rotten to the core, at d
J.’sP. should not be allowed to sit when a P.M.
is available. Or, being allowed to sit they should
rank merely as consultants, powerless to control
the decision of the stipendiary bench—which,
however incompetent, forms a definite and respon-
sible object for criticism. When, in the foul and
shameless days of years ago, the amateur J.’sP.
were allowed to swamp the P.M. on Sydney
licensing bench, a stink arose which has not yet
died away; and now, whenever the wind blows
hard from the South, the stench arising from the
packed benches of Melbourne can be cut with a
knife outside The Bulletin office, 24 Pitt-street,
Sydney—6oo miles away.
Mr. Thomas W. Purse, whose portrait
appears in this issue, is secretary of the Sydney
Eight Hours Demonstration Committee, and the
man who is mainly responsible for the financial suc-
cess of Labor’s annual holiday. In 1892 that show
panned out for a profit of .£739. In ’93, when the
bank and other failures had sat down like a night-
mare on the province and the gate-money fell off
by about .£lOOO, the demonstration still con-
trived to pay its way and show a balance of
£32. And in ’94, when the annual function
seemed to be still on the down-grade in some
respects, it managed to produce a profit of £BOO.
On each occasion the committee reported that the
results achieved were very largely owing to the
tact, energy, and financial ability of the serious-
looking man whose portrait decorates this page,
and there is no doubt that the commendation
was well-deserved. A financier who continues, as
Mr. Fnrse has done, to show a surplus in any line
of business, for three consecutive years, deserves
to have his portrait inserted, that others may
know him arid follow in his footsteps.
'J he destruction of the rabbit, the problem
par excellence of the Australian sheepl reeder,
squatter and agriculturist, has now reached a
satisfactory conclusion. This has been achieved
through the inventive genius of Mr. Marshall, of
Dunedin, N.Z., who has hit upon a poison which
he has named Toxa, and which has proved an
infallible agent in the destruction of the long-eared
pest. Fullest evidence supports this fact. Sir
Charles Clifford, of N.Z., has cleared his run of
rabbits and added 30,000 slieep to his flock.
Thirty rabbits eat the gra-s required for one
sheep, and one rabbit killed in the breed-
ing season (summer) is equal to a dozen
killed in winter. Half -a - crown’s worth of
Toxa will kill 550 rabbits. These are some of the
statistics of the crusade. Toxa has been tested
in each colony with equal success. Recognising
its value as an aid to the pastoral and agricultural
industries, South Australia and Tasmania have
remitted their respective duties of 10 and 20 per
cent, on Toxa, and Vic. has placed no tariff
hindrance in the way of the free and general use
of the drug. N.S.VV. alone imposes an import
duty of 10 per cent. —an amusing inconsistency,
seeing how much the rabbit pest is costing the
country. The National Wool Co. of Australia,
Ltd., are the sole agents for Toxa in Australia and
Tasmania.

J. S. Robinson, the Johannes-
burg multi-millionaire (says The Bul-

tains largely at Park Lane, London,
where he (or his wife) has leased a
mansion. They are in good hands—
one of the numerous branches of the
Lennoxes —and have “the best of

They have been wise enough to fe,el
their way gradually, unlike a well-
known Australian with a somewhat
similar cognomen, who thought to
capture the “ nobs ” by giving a huge
ball ere anybody had even heard his
name. Robinson, who is an anti-
Rhodesian, his fortunes being linked
with those of the Transvaal Republic,
lately lent the Transvaal Govt, a
million sterling to enable it to secure
the Delagoa Bay railway, which has
been done. Rhodes had previously
made an offer of even a larger amount,
which was refused with thanks a
great blow to the Cape dictator whose
dream is to join the whole of South
Africa in a Bund in which the English
will be paramount. The extension of
the Delagoa Bay railway will benefit
Natal, which hitherto has been a kind
of Cinderella, and which Rhodes has
tried his level best to smother. But
the Transvaal people are friendly with
the Natalese, who supplied most of the
money for developing the gold-fields,
and who actually own the only mines
which are paying ; most of those which
were floated in England being of the
shady order.

John Goodman, who succeeded H. C. E.

used to receive deputations with a short black
pipe in his mouth and cutting up black tobacco to
put in it. He would hail the visitors with “Now,

Millionaire Tyson realises that he is being

I can’t hear a word when the House is sitting.”
F. A. Packer, the recently-retired clerk of
Tasmanian Assembly, and composer of several
well-known songs, wrote the cantata “Land of
Beauty ” for Tas. Exhibition opening. Mr.
Packer’s mother was a daughter of Nathaniel
Gow, composer of “Caller Herrin’,” and grand-
daughter of Neil Gow, Scotland’s national

It puzzles many people why “ Bill ” Long,
who is so fond of the bawbees, and so seldom wins
a race, sticks to racing. A friend of Long’s,
knowing “Bill’s” father’s antipathy to horse-
racing, asked him one day, long ago, how he came
to take to the sport. “Because it is the only
game I can see any money in,” was the candid
reply of the M.L.C.
Rev. E. A. Anderson’s appointment to
the bishopric of Riverina has much of its social
gilt rubbed off by the announcements of the
Gunthers, Langleys and others that they would
not take the billet. By the way, ih- see of
Riverina means hard work and small pay for a
bishop, which is probably why many have failed to
hear a divine call.
Re the Denbigh Feildings : Fielding, the
novelist— who belonged to the family—was asked
by his contemporary earl why he put the “i”
before the “e?” “Because, my lord, my branch
of the family has learned to spell! ’’ The Earls
of Denbigh possess the unique (British) distinc-
tion of being Princes of the Holy Roman Empire,
and the recently-arrived General Feilding, of Q.
Transcontinental fame, is the man who was so
laughed at for his preposterous “What to do with
Our Boys.”
Mr. G. C. Henderson, 8.A., of Sydney,
has gained the Brackenbury scholarship for
modern history at Balliol College, Oxford. The
“ Brackenbury ” is the chief scholarship in modern
history open to Oxford undergraduates, and is of
the value of £BO per annum. Mr. Henderson
lately graduated as B.A. in Sydney with first-
class honors in history and philosophy, and he
now holds the James King, of Irrawang, travel-
ling scholarship awarded by the Sydney Univer-
sity, as well as the Fraser history scholarship.
He was lately a student of the Training College
under the N.S. W. Department of Public Instruc-
tion, and holds rank as a teacher in the depart-
ment.
Barring perhaps Tiger Inglis, the N S.W.
statesman, Victorian Minister Peacock has the
loudest and most hideous laugh south of the line.
“ The great Kingfisher of Australia,’’ remarks the
Banker’s Magazine (Vic.), “makes a formid-
able noise, and so does a steam saw-mill; but if
the two were united in one blend, the smile of
Mr. Peacock would surpass it in sweetness and
volume.”
Graves, M.P. for Delatite, Vic., relates
that he was once opposed by D. C. O’Leary, a
grandson of the great Dan. O'Connell, and cousin
to the O’Donoghue. Graves would have been
beaten, but for the fact that the O’Donoghue at
the time of the election had voted in the Commons
against Parnell. The Irish in Delatite, therefore,
made a dead set against his relative, who was
beaten badly by Graves,
George Melrose, the S.A. squatter who
died recently worth .£250,000, began life with 100
ewes, worth in the aggregate about £5, which
were given to him by the squatter for whom he
acted as shepherd. The late Lachlan M‘Bean
received 500 ewes as his guerdon for a similar
service. Crown lands for pasturage were cheap
and plentiful in S.A. in those days, and fences
were few and far between.
Tennyson Smith, the Gough-phonograph,
got an awful slap in the eye while in Melb. He
went to the office of the Tribune, the beer-trade
organ, and asked why they didn’t notice his meet-
ings and slang him. “ Because you’re only a
cheap showman,” grunted the editor. “I am not
a showman,’’ indignantly exclaimed the long-
tressed ranter. Then the tired editor : “ Then
why the devil don’t you get your hair cut ? ”
Rev. G. Pratt, who died last week a* s
Woollahra (N.S.W.), was, in the course of his 77
years, preacher, teacher, medicine-man, com-
pounding chemist, linguist, and author. He left
England for Samoa in ’3B, and, with the exception
of a short period, spent his whole life since about
the islands. Some of his Scripture translations
are now in the hands of Sydney printers, and his
grammar, dictionary, and folklore are all valu-
able.
Some faithful soul placed a wreath on
Nero’s tomb, and even Pastor Talmage has his
admirers. When he called for his account at
Menzies’ Hotel, Melbourne, it was sent up re-
ceipted, with a polite message that the proprie-
tress considered it an honour to have had the
famous preacher under her roof. The best sitting-
room in the hotel had also been placed at the dis-
posal of Talmage and son. This hospitality
is probably unexampled in Australian “ show ”
records.
Sir James Fergusson, now visiting Aus-
tralia, has been thrice married, and each time
married money. His first wife, Lady Ethel
Fergusson, died of typhoid fever during her
husband’s governorship of S.A. Sir James then
married Miss Richman, adopted daughter of
squatter Hughes, the latter’s dowry to the bride
being <£70,000. The second wife died in India of
cholera, and about three years ago a third Lady
Fergusson succeeded her in the person of the
wealthy widow of a London clergyman. The
youngster who received twelve months last week
for burning down a wing of his college is probably
a son of the second wife, and, with his brother,
inherits £70,000 on coming of age.

If Duncan Gillies does not take great care
(remarks an Anglo - Australian writing from
London to The Bulletin) he will soon find him-
self landed amongst the Marlborough House
‘ set of hangers-on. He is a great pal of Mr.
“ Gibson-Milhir,” and is very often at the latter’s
chambers in Queen’s Mansions, where “Somers*
Vine” is generally to be found also. Duncan
will have to find some new coin for tipping Royal
flunkies. Copper may do well enough down
Echuca way, but something better is expected at
Pall Mall.
Attorney-General Byrnes (Q.), long the
despair of mothers with marriageable daughters,
has at last fallen a victim to a little Brisbane lass
well-known in musical circles. The young lady’s
family are of the Church of England, but report
hath it that she has recently undergone a change
of views. Byrnes is a good Catholic, and the
faithful swear by him.

Outside the Ministry, perhaps the strongest
man in S.A. Assembly is the Teutonic ex-Attorney
General Homburg, who has washed his hands of
Opposition obstruction.
Yarmouth, the skirt-dancing earl, described
by a mordant humorist as “ the latest British
bounder,’’ is badly wanted by divers Melbourne
charities to uncover his noble calves in the sacred
cause. The Melb. Hospital committee thinks
that if he could be prevailed upon to skirt-dance
for the benefit of their institution, “society”
would eagerly respond.
The Full Court hearing of Speight v. Syme
must go over till March or April. Judge Hodges
heard one case, Williams the second, Madden was
counsel for one of the parties at an earlier stage,
and Hood is away on leave. So there are only two
Judges available till Hood comes back. Then we
will hear whether the jury’s verdict was really
for plaintiff or for defendant.
Of 14 professors at Melb. Uni-
versity, only three—Elkington, Allen
and Kernot —were raised there. But
10 lecturers out of 21—to wit, Gregr ry,
Cussen and Duffy in the law school,
Smith, Henderson and Fowler in the
engineering school, Springthorpe,
Cherry, Hall and Kirkland in the
medical school—were trained wh<re
they teach ; so were the six medical
demonstrators.
Old John Nimmo, ex-M.L.A.
(Yic.), has dead against champagne
lunches at Royal Commissions. The
Yan Yean Commission visited Fe n-
shawe once. John took a pannikin of
water from the stream and sat apart
at lunch. Noticing the guide refuse a
drink, John rose up and congratulated
him on his abstinence principles.
Then the guide whispered: “You
see, it doesn’t do for me to drink. I
keep a pub.” Old John = to’e away, a
broken man.
Mr. Justice Bundey, who has
sat on Adelaide Supreme Court Bench
since ’B4, the latest change in its con-
stitution, has never taken a day’s
holiday from his judicial duties. The
Chief Justice recently enjoyed a
European and American trip for 15
months on full pay, and Mr. Boucaut
had a year’s holiday immediately
afterwards. Mr. Bundey is the only
Judge who never pushes himself into
any public affair, and who rigidly
eschews all business entanglements-
Both Mr. Way and Mr. Boucaut are
squatters, and the former essays to be
a leader of society also.
Poor old “ Jolly Sir John
Astley ” (writes a | Bulletin corre-
spondent) has gone to a world which
it is hoped will prove a better one
for him than this. A sportsman to
the tips of his fingers, he was all that
was chivalrous, generous, and kind.
He was a great admirer of Australian
scullers, and never failed to enquire
for Trickett whenever I met him. It
is not generally known that he in-
sisted on finding a share of Laycock’s
stake, with Lord Londesborough,
when the long Australian rowed Boyd
on the Tees. To Trickett he always
referred as one of the straightest men
he had ever met, though he could
never be brought to believe that Ned
could hold a candle to Hanlan.
The worst disaster which has yet fallen
upon Major Bartrop, J.P., &c., whose conduct is
now being investigated in Melbourne, was Justice
Hodges’allusion to him as “one Bartrop.” A
man never really knows how far he has dropped
until he hears himself publicly described as
“one Bartrop.” The Civil Service Board has
found the charges against the Major unproven.


WHAT JIMMY D„ THE NEW
M.P., SAYS.
In a recent interview, one of the most_ successful
newly-fledged M.’sP. was asked by an inquisitive
reporter what move be considered had most con-
tributed to his election. “No particular move
whatever,” was the answer. “I only gave my
electors to understand that I am a practical ana
an honest man ; that as I know the art, of living
within my income the same art might als > ie use-
ful to the Government, if I had my siy m the
House. To illustrate my opinion, I simply drew
forth a packet of Frossard’s Cavour Cigars, saying
that these were the cigars I always smoked ; my
purse could afford more expensive opes, but my
practical sense told me that a similar mild and
aromatic smoke could not be obtained at less than
sixpence each, wliereas these Cavours are sold
everywhere in packets of eight for one shilling.

Take a couple of Fletcher’s Pills every second
night; they are a prompt and sure cure and give
certain relief.
FLETCHER’S PILLS are a quick, sure and
reliable remedy for all complaints arising from
torpid liver, indigestion, weak stomach and im-
purities of the blood. They are prepared on
rational and sensible lines and do not contain a
particle of calomel, gamboge, or any drastic
purgative, but operate by perfectly natural means,
by stimulating the liver and increasing the flow of
bile and thus producing easy evacuations and
natural catharses without the annoyance and pain
of griping and purging.
Beware of the many harmful substitutes on sale
in many shops. None are genuine unless
they bear the signature of F. Moore Clements
on the outside wrapper. CLEMENTS TONIC
and FLETCHER’S PILLS have become
such household words that imitations are fre-
quently offered. We contend that this imitation
is the sincerest proof of their virtues, so see
that you always get the genuine, bearing the

Although Mclb. Age has been barracking
loudly for the land-values-tax, David Symes is
said to be strongly opposed to it in private life.
Certain street-orators advocate that the

Dibbs is not Dibbs—he is only Willis.
The Dibbs regime in N.S.W. was pure fiction.

The Woolloomooloo resumption - cases

The other day, B. R. Wise warned N.S.W.

Seeing that N.S.W. Public Works Depart-

now setting a Royal Commission to inquire into
the vices and virtues of that gigantic institution?
All the members of W.A. Govt, voted
against James’ proposal to exclude Chinese and
Asiatics from goldfields ; and also against the
same member’s bill to prevent the naturalisation
of Chinese. Their faces are white, but their
hearts are yellow.
The bottom is practically knocked out of
M.L. Prohibition by the Supreme Court’s decision
that an adverse local option poll only affects retail
licenses ; and the presiding magistrate may permit
as much wholesale trade as he pleases. The usual
horse-and-cart !
A candidate at *ast Yic. elections, who
forfeited his .£5O deposit, is sueing a big morning
paper for heavy damages for referring to him as a
“ political traitor.” The action should give a very
small div. Please name two Australian politicians
who are not political traitors.
S.A. Legislative Council widened the
exemption under the absentee-tax so as to include
the whole of Australasia, the original intention of
the Govt, being to charge everyone outside South
Australia. Squatter Duncan moved for the sub-
stitution of “ the British Empire.”
A village settlement on the absentee prin-
ciple was established by the Patterson Govt, at
Miepoll, near Enroa (Vic.). The “ settlers ” have
not settled. They take work and board and
lodging and waves from neighboring dairymen—
and subsistence-money from the Govt.
Unsatisfactory anomaly : An uncertificated
insolvent may be a N.S.W. M.P., but he cannot
be an alderman. An alderman lately retired from
a council-table on account of having filed his
schedule, and a few days afterwards presented
himself as a candidate for Parliament, and was re-
turned.
The Parkes star steadily wanes. The
other day, J. F. Cullen, “the Willoughby
Squeaker,” an ex-clergyman who had resigned his
seat on account of insolvency, presented himself
for re-election and was beaten by E. M. Clarke,
anti-Parkesite. Mr. Cullen was the gentleman
who used to hold Parkes’ books of reference
during the old man’s Assembly speeches.
It is all cut-and-dried that when Mr.
Justice Foster (N.S.W.) retires, which may be any
day, Attorney-General Simpson is to go on the
Bench and “Jack” Want is to take his place as
Attorney-General. Mr. Want, as per his letter
to tiie press, is a whole-souled advocate of the
system of judge’s-relations practising before their
Honors, and so will be very handy in the Assem-
bly as a champion of the existing order of things.
Ex-Premier
Patterson opposes
the Victorian
Land-tax Bill on
the ground that
“it is quite im-
possible to fix the
value of land at
the present time.”
Mr. Patterson
might kindly ex-
plain if it has been
possible to fix the
value of land at
any time for the
last 10 years—or
at any ether time
for that matter?
Six years ago the.
objection to a
land - tax would
have been that no
one knew whether
his city allotment
was worth <£loo
or .£2000. , Now
the objection is
that no one knows
whether the same
allotment is worth
.£lOO or £5O. Ex-
cept in an abso-
lutely stagnant
community land
never has any
fixed value. Who
expects that it
should ? There is
no fixed value for
J. B. Patterson,
bank-shares, gold,
silver, coal, tram-
way, insurance,
or gas shares, de-
posit receipts,
Government de-
bentures, wheat,
“spuds,” eggs,
tallow— anything,
in fact!
Premier Heid blames Alex. Biown for
bringing his private interests into N.S.W. Legis-
lative Council and standing guard over them while
the Mining Bill is in progress ; but when Haynes
brings up his barristerial fee-snatching Bill it is
quite a certainty that wigites, and among them
probably the Premier himself, will stand over their
private interests in the Assembly and will escape
Cabinet condemnation.
The veteran N.S.W. Agent-General Saul
Samuel cannot be disposed of so easily as N.S.W.
members appeared to think the other night. Ho
can be deposed only on pension, as he comes under
the provisions of the Civil Service Act; and t ie
present is no time to appoint a potentate with the
enlarged salary Bibbs foreshadows, and to retire
the present occupant of office on to a cushion
stuffed with taxpayers’ bank-notes.
The M‘Kenzie want-of-confidence motion
against the Turner Govt. (Vic.) was defeated
by 55 to 33. The only hope now of the Vic.
anti-increased-hmd-tax crowd the Legislative
Council. Unhappily, in Victoria, Patman is an
elected representative of Property, and can t be
swamped like his nominee congeners elsewhere.
The only weapon at the Vic. Assembly s com-
mand is a “ tack ” to an Appropriation Bill.
A would-be N.S.W. legislator, whose peti-
tion against the sitting member was held un-
sustained by the Parliamentary Elections Com-
mittee, courteously describes that body as “ a lot
of bottle-eyed dog-wallopers.”
Reid’s N.S.W. Land and Income Tax
Assessment Bill is the lineal descendant and heir-
at-law of the existing system of party government.
By it two distinctly different measures are simul-
taneously presented to the House, and members
who want a land-tax can’t vote for it without
voting for an income-tax to which they are
opposed ; while those who yearn for an income-
tax and loathe a land tax must vote for the latter,
or surrender the hope of gaining the former.
N.S.W. Postmaster-General Cooks publi-
cation of the names of the bookmakers who, he said
(though they deny it), informed on their fellows,
and Premier Reid’s disclosure of the names of civil-
service officials who composed criticisms on their
Parliamentary ex-chiefs, are new of
official discretion which may have injurious
results. Much ‘‘information received” is the
growth of confidence in official reticence.
One of the most noteworthy features of
the existing Vic. land-tax is that it applies to
country lands only; no city boomer pays one
solitary copper under its provisions. All estates
worth less than £2500 are exempt; also all estates
of less than 640 acres. As nobody owns 640 acres
of city property all Melbourne, Geelong, Bendigo
and Ballarat are exempt. Berry’s land-tax is
about the most clumsy and iniquitous device of
the kind ever invented.
Q. Assembly has given MTlwraith leave
of absence for the rest of the session. The once
“indispensable” Thomas has hardly been seen
by anybody for months, and all sorts of weird
legends are afloat as to his condition. According
to the talk in the street, the knight of Anchen-
flower suffers from a hopeless complication of
troubles. But the one point on which all who
know nothing about him are agreed is that he will
never appear in politics again.
The S.M. Hkrald disapproved of Premier
Reid’s inclusion of a land-tax and an income-tax
in one Bill. Sydney D.T. sniggered contentedly.
Ex-Treasurer M'Millan disapproved. The D.
suddenly discovere d that “ most people who have
studied economic questions to any purpose will
have a difficulty in following the Premier to this
conclusion ” —the aforesaid inclusion. Reid may
now be expected to separate the two schemes, for
the D.T. is his bell-wether, and M'Millan is the
D.T.’s ham-squatting idol.
The Amos land resumption case —in which
the N.S.W. Railway Commissioners offered £l5OO
for 12 acres of land near Mittagong, while the
owner demanded £209,000-has been settled by
the plaintiff getting back his property. When the
land-tax comes along it is to be hoped that the
Government will remember that Mr. Amos’ piece
of land, by his own showing, is worth £209,000,
and will tax it accordingly. If it doesn’t tax it
accordingly, then it will be casting a wicked
aspersion on the owner’s veracity,
Q. Government had a small crisis last
week, when a snap division engineered by the
disgusted John L. Hamilton—whose Increased
Payment of Members Bill Boodlewraith refuses
to press through the Leg. Council —gave an
Opposition majority of four. The Govt, adjourned
and brought the vote up again next day, when,
thanks to a bit of dexterous underground work
among the Opposition weak-knees. Premier Nel-
son secured a majority of one vote and bristled
RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS.
Visiting Parson: “And vow, my dears, what should the Israelites
have done after Gawd's goodness in bringing them through the
Red Sea?"
A Voice : “ Dried their selves! ”
with triumph. All the same, the episode has
made Boodlewraith uneasy.
Re the opposition to the unimproved land
value tax in Vie. Parliament, in the interests of
the “poor struggling farmer.” Squatter Staughton
has 36,000 a., on which his present tax payment is
only ii 37 per annum. Under the new tax he
would have to pay £6OO. P. Russell a present tax
is £l7OO, on 141,000 a. Even valuing the land at
only £1 per acre, Mr. Russell would, under the
proposed tax, have to pay .£2350 ~~ r#
Chirnside, on 155,365 a., now pays .£1783; under
the new law he will pay .£3235, even at a land-
value of but .£1 per acre.
N.S.W. Legislative Council wrote itself
down a purely capitalistic machine by one little
exploit over clause 69 of the Coal Mines -Bii.
That clause provides that no prosecution shall be
instituted against owner, manager, agent, op em-
ployee, for any offence not personally committed,
except the prosecution is authorised by an in-
spector or in writing by a Minister. Ibe Council
struck out the word “employee,’ and carried t e
rest of the clause with a yell, boon after Jacob
said to Hoskins : “ We sit here in the interests of
the whole country ; the other place is > dominated
by a faction that looks only to a class.

THE TRUE INWARDNESS OF
SPOOKS.
The accompanying illustration (reproduced
from “ Further Light upon the Mysteries of
Spookland ”) gives Mr. T. S. Henry’s idea of how
“Geordie” and “Cissy” are manufactured tc
meet the spiritualassic demand for apparitions
from the other side of Jordan. Given a darkened
room, a couple of masks, and a little drapery, any
Bulletin reader can now manufacture his own
spirits in large or small quantities as required to
suit customers.
M.L. Minister for Labor Reeves gets home
on the anti-land-taxers who point every doleful
prognostication with “ Look at IVlaoriland !
The M.L. land-tax is three and a-half years old.
If, says Mr. Reeves, the farmers have suffered,
how is it that they made a clean sweep of land-
tax opponents at last year’s general election?
Whence was most capital withdrawn last year—
from Maoriland or from the smashed and smashing
hanks of Australasia—who have found it neces-
sary to prevent by law the depositors from taking
out their funds ? If capital is so scarce in Maori-
land, why are the banks reducing deposit in-
terest? And, finally, if the land-tax has ruined
Maoriland credit, how is it that her securities
stand at the top of the Australasian list on the
London Stock Exchange? Hey!

The police have not yet struck “ pay-

Mrs. Mellon has vindicated herself. She was tied up in a “ black bag,
and locked up in a wire cage. Lest the whole bag of tricks should become too
etherialised and escape through the chimney, a rope was attached, and a
heavy-weight M.P. made a very effective kellick.
Judge Windeyer was present with an impartial jury, who wer©

kindred spirits, left the court without a stain upon their characters.

The Rev. D. O’Donnell, complimenting
the ladies of Melb. W.C.T.U.:—“It is the
‘ screws ’ who do the work of the world, not the
magnificent carriage-horses. You will never get
the Governor’s wife to join you.’’ The Rev. O’D.
is not now so popular as he used to be at the
W.C.T.U. A woman may be very meek and
lowly, but she never becomes absolutely indifferent
to the opinion of man in the matter of her legs,
and you cannot call even a member of the
W.C.T.U. a “ screw ” with impunity. It’s enough
to force her into knickerbockers just to show that
they are perfectly straight. There now !

The latest idea in trades-unions is a pro-
posed “Ministers’ Wives’ Association.” Good,
by St. Dorcas and St. Gimlet and St. Gossip! as
far as it goes. But what of the celibate clergy?
Are they, in addition to their fleshly loneliness, to
be unrepresented among the leagues of the Re-
generate New Woman? Why not a “Celibate
Parsons’ Female-Admirers’ Association ?” By the
•great carpet-slipper of the lonely sacred hearth,
■this is a weepful necessity ! Moreover, are devout
■lay males to be debarred from membership of the
“Ministers’ Wives’ Association”? A devout
'layman is often a great source of consolation and
’restfulness to a minister’s wife, and the link is holier
than any sympathetic connection ever idealised by
‘Plato. Then the corollaries of these schemes are
•endless. The soaring purity of this generation
craves for a “Ministers’ Sisters’ Association,” of
which all brothers of the churches may be honorary
and sympathetic members. Salutations to the
devout! Spread abroad the scrumptious and
holy kiss of peace ! Long may she smack !

The Social Purity section of the Presby-
terian Assembly sooled on their Chief Gimleteer
to urge the Vic. Chief Commissioner of Police to
suppress the Tableaux Vivants. In an indignant
letter the C.G. pointed out that the tableaux ex-
hibited in Collins-st. were immoral and responsible
for the increase in divorce. In reply to which
rubbish the Chief Commissioner replied that he
had not personally had an opportunity of seeing
the tableaux, but from all he could learn there was
nothing in them that could be objected to. He
further pointed out that the photographs com-
plained of were not those of the tableaux at all,
but merely of famous works of art which the
living pictures represented.

So far as The Bulletin is concerned, all
divorce-reports can be sub-edited by the W.C.T.U.,
which would no doubt dearly love the job. But
if the expurgation of divorce-reports is to operate
at all it should operate all round—not only in
the moneyed case Synnot v. Synnot, but also in
the coster case Hawkins v. Hawkins. Vic. Judge
A’Beckett must take care not to give moneyed
suitors a monopoly of his protection from the
evening press.

You now see lady-trainers at Melb. sub-
urban pony-meetings. There are only two at pre-
sent, but more are to follow. They superintend
the preparation of the ponies, saddle them up, see
that the boy weighs out, give him a leg-up, and,
after the race, rub the pony down, allesame as
a man. There are very few he-trainers, who can
give them a pound in training a pony—or in
“talk,” either.
THE NEW WOMAN: Miss HELEN
HART , lecturess, on a political campaign.
The Bulletin predicts that little more will
be seen in Australia of Mrs. Mellon as a medium
save by her intimate friends. The “ test seance,
with its nebulous results, was an affair admirably
designed to make her fall as easy as possible.
Though this so-called “ test-sdance ”
was, broadly speaking, conducted by a little_gang
of spiritualists —some of them howling hystericists,
credulous to the last degree, others, inquirers
fast getting into the dupe stage—what was the
result? Nothing, save some indefinable white
apparitions, which might have been the ghosts of
the pigs stuck at the abattoirs the night before,
just as they might have been the ghosts of the four
choked little Mount Rennie boys or the shade of
the Marble Man. Under the circs., the exultant
shriek of Dr. McCarthy in the daily press is as
pitiable as it is absurd.
The public idea of a proper test-committee
would be something like this : Three or four lead-
ing doctors—say Drs. Sydney Jones, Scot-Skirving,
Fiaschi and Angel-Money (if they had time to
devote to the investigation of such oft-exploded
shams); a couple of conjurors, two female
searchers from Darlinghurst prison, and two or
three people who, having inspected the horsehair
with which the spiritualistic cocoanut is stuffed,
have cast their delusions behind them. Then let
the cranks nominate an equal number and go
ahead.
The emotional doctor who has been the main-
stay of discredited Mellon spooks gravely counsels
believers not to be misled by impulse, but to
investigate the phenomena in a calm, judicial
manner ! Satan and Sin surely must have been
spiritualasses.

Verbatim.
The story goes that when the sister of a
well-known North-West Australian magnate
was seduced by another prominent society spark,
the brother vowed that he would be the lover of
the seducer’s wife. He fulfilled his vow. Said

mind that so much, but when it came to all of

it was too much. Ho had to draw the line some-
where, so he shipped the lady home.

When the skirt-dancing Yarmouth arrived
in Melbourne last week he was immediately
attacked by a Herald interviewer—whom he re-
buffed with a cold, aristocratic stare. The Herald
came out same day with an alleged portrait of the
gifted young nobleman in which—by a slip of the
chisel —he is represented as having a ring in his
nose or else a polypus depending from his near
nostril. He seems a harmless young man enough
—at least when dressed as a male—
Why should it of this peer he said
That he no sense of shame reveals,
If, having nothing in his head,
At fame he clutches—with his heels ?

The yarn about one Robert Stewart, fined
for drunkenness, vainly endeavoring to “stiffen”
an editor, who next morning was rewarded for his
stringent adherence to duty by reading the name
of defendant as “Ronald Sievart,” recalls another
where the positions are reversed. A certain mag-
nate, being fined at a Police Court, approached
the single reporter present with an offer of <£lo
to keep his name out of the paper. Being re-
fused, the bribe was gradually increased to .£2O

Next day, however, that reporter noticed that his

On the acquittal, at Brisbane, of John

Gr iffith is reported to have remarked that Willard

was not lucky had nothing whatever to do with
Judge Griffith in his official capacity; and such
remarks should be resented every lb is
gratuitously insolent for any judge to criticise the
verdict of any jurv, and The Bulletin hopes yet
to find a jury-foreman, when insulted in this
fashion, telling His Honor, respectfully but
plainly, to mind his own business.

Miss Flora Esdaile, the talented young
artiste whose portrait appears in this week’s Bul-
letin, is a native of Auckland by birth, and a
Melbourneite by adoption. Her voice early gave
great promise, and at 15 she gained first prize at
Melb. Juvenile Exhibition. Signor Hazon soon
afterwards took Miss Esdaile in hand, and she
made her first appearance in public under his
auspices. Subsequently Miss Esdaile took lessons
from Madame Lucy Chambers, and afterwards
joined Nellie Stewart’s Opera Co., playing
Beatrice in “Boccaccio,” and Gaeswinda m
“Chilperic,” to Melbourne audiences. Since
then she has been in the thick of engage-
ments, having played for Gourlay in musical
comedy; for the M'Mahons in burlesque;
and for George Rignold in “ Midsummer Night s
Dream.” J.C.W.’s keen eye soon noted Miss
Esdaile’s promising quality, and she took a pan-
tomime part in “ Babes of the Wood,” afterwards
touring with the Royal Comic Opera Go., the
Gaiety Burlesquers, and the Italian Opera Co.
With the last-named in Melbourne she played
Lola in “ Cavalleria Rusticana,” and the con-
ductor was very anxious that she should come to
Italy, but at the time that was impossible.
Madame Belle Cole has advised Miss Esdaile
strongly to go to London to study, and she hopes
to leave for England early next year. In the
meantime, she is to take the loading singing part
in the pantomime at Sydney Her Majesty’s.

The chief anxiety of one of the Parra-

The fact of a certain Melbourne journal’s
special reporter being in Hobart for the Exhibi-
tion was a bad thing for the Earl of Yarmouth.
The following is the text of the reporter’s message
to headquarters when it was known what the
nature of the “ noble lord’s ” entertainment was to
be : “ The Earl of Yarmouth —a young man of 23
—is going to make a confounded ass of himself at
the Theatre Royal on Monday evening by leading
in sundry music-hall vagaries. What am I to do
to save the nobility from such a reproach ? ” And
the answer came something like this : “ Cable
full particulars, give him beans, and hang the
expense.” Hence the young man’s anger and the
salvation of the nobility !

Ex.-attachd Forbes, so far the only bagged

suite, is in appearance a typical “Sandy Mac.,”
yellow-haired and lean, the latter characteristic
accentuated on state occasions by kilts, a costume
surely designed by some Sassenach demon
to exaggerate the angles of Bony Scotland’s
sons. The bridegroom’s liege lord and lady, smil-
ing tolerantly upon the alliance, travelled from
Wiridgil to glorify the nuptials with their pre-
sence, an honor scarcely anticipated by the over-
joyed recipients. The Hopetouns, unlike their
match-making predecessors, have hitherto arro-
gated to themselves the undivided love and
obedience of the staff, no member of which, until
lately, dared transgress the unwritten law, “Fol-
lowers not allowed.”

Mobbs, of N.S.W., is coming to England to pro-
secute a claim to a large estate. If he be a
claimant to the Hoxton Estate, which is now a
part of Greater London, he may as well stay
where he is. The Mobbs case is good up to a
certain point, but the one necessary link is miss-
ing, and Lord Alington cannot be ousted. The
writer knows, for he advanced money to a member
of the Mobbs family to assist in recovering the
property, and a small company was formed for
the same purpose and debentures issued, all to no
purpose. Alington draws about .£BO,OOO a year
from the property, on which his grandfather,
Humphrey Sturt, lent a couple of hundreds
only on mortgage. Those who know how care-
lessly old records were looked after will not
wonder that in all such oases it is always the most
important deed which can never be traced.

Young Tom Brown, who was married to
the eldest daughter of Chief Justice Griffith in
Brisbane on 28th Nov., is one Of the firm of D. L.
Brown and Go., and is a good type of the Scotch
Queenslander. He belongs to a strict Presby-
terian family, and his bride is grand-daughter of
the late “ papa ” Griffith, who was a pronounced
Nonconformist and minister of the Congregational
Church in Wharf-street, Brisbane. The match
attracted so much “ society ’’attention in Brisbane
that St. John’s Anglican Church was deemed the
proper place for the wedding.

Why doesn’t R. S. Smythe organise a
fresh young concert-company from the heap of
native talent now available? He has been dealing
in imported “stars” for a good many years, but
The Bulletin never heard of him trying to make
’em himself. Mrs. Armstrong was a glorious
singer before she left Melbourne, yet she was
allowed to warble gratis at Liedertafel concerts
and bazaars, and other haunts of amateurism,
until the public couldn’t have been persuaded that
they were listening to Madame Melba. Wanted
a manager with faith in his own judgment, who
will get hold of any first-class local article before
the name becomes well-known, and spend £lOO in
advertising the greatness of his discovery. It is
absurd to argue that local artists can’t be
“starred.” Remember Essie Jenyns.

The other day an elderly woman suicided
at Redfern (Sydney) through “family misfor-
tunes.” She had two daughters ; the husband of
one went to South Africa in search of employ-
ment, and his infant died in his absence. Then
news arrived of the husband’s death, and on hear-
ing this the young widow went out and attempted
suicide on her child’s grave. Shortly after this
the husband of the other daughter became a
lunatic and had to be removed to an asylum. The
rest of the family were mostly out of work, and
so, at last, the poor mother of all these misfortunes
arose early one morning and sawed her head
nearly off.

most of them were bruised and horribly dis-
figured. A good business is being done in these
gruesome relics, and apparently there is no law to
stop the ghoulish trade.

Dear Bulletin, —The most pathetic illus-
tration of the depression in Melbourne which 1
have yet met takes the shape of a man of a
Hittite cast of countenance, whom I used to notice
about the streets some months ago, admire
because of his magnificent black c> . -which
suggested the curled and oiled Assyrian bull. I
saw him again the other day. His curls were
black no more ; their hue was sickly grey. Hard
times —no money for hair-dye. Tears came to my
eyes as I looked at him. Judge how his heart
must have been wrung ! — Creeve Roe.

Sydney harbor is getting along nicely.
About the most picturesque part of the Lane Cove
River is artfully disfigured with a starch mill and
a piggery. A beautiful reach of the Parramatta
is adorned with a large, reddish, smellful gas-
works. The wide stretch of water where the Par-
ramatta and Lane Cove fall into the harbour is
decorated with an iron-foundry and a kerosene
bond ; and a wool-store glares forth on Kirribilli
Point. And now a specially smellful bone-mill
has been started in Kerosene Bay, and, on a hot
day, the sickly odour of crushed bones pervades
Balmain, Drummoyne, Greenwich, Darling Har-
bour. and all Iron Cove. There are only about
half a dozen of these eye-sores, all told, but they
are so judiciously spread, and so carefully planted
on the most lovely spots available, that it is hardly
possible not to be in sight or in smell of one of
them. About the only place of refuge soon will
be Middle Harbor, where, by the way, a thought-
ful corporation has erected nightsoil-dessicating
works.

Mr. Thomas Edgeworth, Binalong, who writes
on June 12th, 1893: —About twelve months ago
I was a great sufferer from indigestion. Tin
symptoms from which I have suffered were great
pains in the chest, especially after meals. I had
no sooner eaten anything than I would have a
violent fit of retching ; I could not retain anything
on my stomach; the consequence was that 1
became weaker daily, although I had the advice
of a doctor, and also his medicine ; I derived no
benefit from either. Seeing so much about Clem-
ents Tonic in every newspaper I took up, I resolved
to get a bottle. I did so, and by the time I had
finished the third bottle I was thoroughly cured
of all disagreeable symptoms. If ever I feel out
of sorts, I fly to Clements Tonic, and I am happy
to say I am never disappointed. If I was to write
for a month I could not say more in favour of
Clements Tonic, though I am a thorough believer
in it. —I remain, yours sincerely, Thomas Edge-
worth, fencer, Binalong.

the mixture, unstrained, is administered to the
patient each day in suitable doses, the result in
the five cases in which it has been tried being that
all pain ceased, and there was a marked improve-
ment in general health.

v The surveying profession feels the depres-
sion very severely. Sydney surveyors recently
tendered at from ,€22 to .£llO for a detail survey
near Bogolong, and the surveyor tendering at £29
received the contract. Granted fine weather he
has three weeks’ field-work before him and two
weeks’ office-work, and so, if Providence be pro-
pitious, he can hope to make the wages of an
ordinary camp-cook. Another recent tender was
for making out 16,000 graves for the Wesleyan
Cemetery Trust, at Rookwood, Sydney. Nearly
all the surveyors tendered at 6d. or 7d. a grave,
but the job fell to the man whose tender was 2|d.
There are, by the way, some 13,000 Wesleyans
already interred at Rookwood.
Christmas is a veritable god-send to the
Sydney papers. One paper advertises a “free
gift Christmas-box ” of £lo, to be balloted for
by those of its readers who care to write
their names on a coupon, and send it to the office
together with “one penny stamp.” Which means
that when the first “ 2000 constant subscribers ”
send in their coupons, the paper will have raked
in its £lO, and every coupon thereafter with the
penny stamp will go into the proprietor’s pocket.
Truly a safe and ingenious Christmas-box !
Dear Bulletin, —Touching the strychnine
v. chloride of lime controversy in connection with
snake-poisoning. In the first place, snake-venom
may kill in two ways. If a fatal dose be rapidly

Dr. MUELLER, of Yackandandah, Vic.,
propounder of the strychnia remedy for
snake-bite.
injected directly into the blood, i.e., through the
wall of a vein or artery, the blood immediately
clots, and death ensues from the clots filling up
the chambers of the heart and so stopping its
action. In this case, of course, the blood is
coagulated after death. But if, on the other
hand, a fatal dose be injected under the skin, but
not directly into a vein or artery, a chemical
alteration takes place in the blood, due, possibly,
as Professor Halford believes, to the presence of
some ferment in the venom. This altered blood,
circulating through the nervous system, has a
deleterious effect upon it, reducing its power bit
by bit, and so gradually slowing down the
heart’s action till death ensues from heart-
stoppage. In this case, the blood is fluid
after death. In the second place, the actions
of the two alleged antidotes are entirely different.
The chloride of lime acts chemically upon the
venom, decomposing it and so preventing it from
acting on the blood. Strychnine, however,
does not act on the venom at all, but is a
stimulant which aids in keeping the heart
going till the poison is worked out of the
system by the excretory organs. Now, a com-
parison of the two actions of the venom, and of
the actions of the alleged antidotes, suggests three
inferences ; (a) that in the case of direct injection
of venom into a blood-vessel, chloride of lime
would be almost, it not quite, useless on account
of the extreme rapidity with which venom acts
when mixed with a quantity of blood ; (b) that
strychnine would in the same case be absolutely
useless, because, no matter how much the
heart may be stimulated, it can no more
pump clotted blood than an ordinary well-
pump can lift half-cold tar or mud ; (c)
that, in the case of injection under the skin,
but not directly into a vein or artery, both the
lime-salt and the strychnine would be more or less
efficacious, for, owing to hypodermically-injected
venom taking a longer time to work through the
tissues into the blood, the lime-salt would have
any amount of opportunity to decompose the
venom before it had much chance to do harm,
while the strychnine, by stimulating the heart,
would keep the patient alive while the lime-salt
was at work. It is therefore not impossible that
the most useful treatment would be to utilise both
alleged antidotes. Now, as to Dr. Mueller, no
one doubts his statement that all snake-bitten
persons treated by his strychnine method exactly
as he directs have recovered. But to argue
from those cases that strychnine is a true
antidote is illogioal, being an illustration of
the fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc. Dr.
Mueller’s argument is shortly this—bite, strych-
nine, recovery ; therefore strychnine is an anti-
dote to snake venom. There are three possible
qualifying circumstances which he totally ignores,
(a) the snake’s poison-gland may have been empty
at the time of biting; (6) the amount of poison
injected may have been less than a fatal dose ; (c)
some animals, and possibly, therefore, some persons,
are more or less immune for various reasons. The
only certain and effective way to settle the matter
would be to inject venom into 30 well-grown
healthy men—into a bloodvessel in 15 cases and
hypodermically into the remainder. Then treat
five from each set with the lime-salt only, another
five of each set with strychnine only, and the re-
maining five of each set with both the lime-salt
and the strychnine. The results would give an
absolutely final verdict. But, as these experi-
ments would be legally thirty direct attempts to
murder, they are not likely to be performed.—
Yours truly, Steele Grey.

846 Macquarie-streeb North, Sydney,
December 4, 1894,
Mr Dear Moorabinda—
Gov. Duff and family got away from Sydney on
the hottest day locally experienced in Nov. since
—well, long before I was born. It is an indica-
tion of the panting new-chum, by the way, that
he always makes a break for green hills afar off
on a day when the weather goes one better than
Tophet, instead of calmly sitting down on a wet
cabbage-leaf and putting off his Hegira until the
Mercury comes down a rung or so. The vice-
regal interest is withdrawn to Moss Yale decently
and according to the regulations. That is one
great comfort about the Duffs—they go round the
good old V.R. circus-ring without wanting to
jump on the cushions, so to speak—whereas the
Jerseys were for ever running wide of the social
peg-marks. One summer, “M.E.J.” neglected
Moss Vale and toured Maoriland, and the society
folks, in what has been called the Simla of
N.S.W., pined in vain for small vice-regal tea-
parties under the shadeless gum-trees. By the
way, Governor Duff means to make fortnightly
visits to town from his Arcadian retreat, so that
the Hie’lan’ Society may catch his Excellency yet.
A distinguished personage who still yearns in
vain for a son and heir must have had uncommon
moral fortitude several years ago to refrain from
doing the warming-pan trick when a flourishing
boylet was charged to his account by an un-
principled woman. The wild oat is now a
flourishing youth—but the opportunity to palm
him off on the lawyers has gone for ever.
It seems to me that the upper classes lose grit
nowadays, and wouldn’t know what to do with
the bowl and dagger of the Middling Ages. What
a romance in real life the world might have had if
that illegal infant had been smuggled into my
lady’s chamber ! Then the conventional sequel—
the haughty potentate confessing on his death-bed
that the young Asterisk had not a strawberry-
mark on his left arm, amid the cheering of the
next of kin. If people won’t commit a promising
crime like that what nope is there for the “society ”
paragraph ists 1
For up-to-date reading commend me to church-
reports, and if I quote this one in extenso it is
because I am so fascinated by the simple, direct
way in which it shows how lovely woman runs the
churches for all they’re worth, and to cut a syllable
would spoil it. It all occurred on the Riverina
(N.S.W.). At a meeting of the synod: “It was
recommended that a probationer be appointed to
the Adelong circuit, and an unmarried home mis-
sionary to Gundagai, the probationer to reside at
Tumut. The Narandera, Wilcannia, and Went-
worth circuits were relieved from their obligations
to take married preachers in place of single ones.
The Deniliquin circuit requested to be relieved of
its married preacher, but the request was nob
granted. The statistical returns show a general
increase. ”
It seems to me that the parson is between the
devil and the deep sea. They want to lasso
him in a sentimeutally-unbroken condition; bub
what sort of a chance has he got to preserve his
maiden modesty in the midst of howling hordes of
hook-nosed spinsters, fluffy choir-girls, and
slipper-faking ingenues, I should like to know?
And when he has killed the goose that lays the
golden eggs and sacrificed himself in the marriage-
market (as every petticoat in the district intended
that he should, or why screech for a bachelor?),
then he has the rest of his flock—for even the best-
intentioned cleric can marry but one lamb at a
time—“requesting to be relieved of its married
ineacher,” as per matrimonial advb. It takes a
ot of diplomacy for a married man to steer a
cargo of single females to the Golden Gate these
times. By the way, I read a book the other day
in which it was asserted that the only crime the
cloth never committed was arson 1 They get too
much blazes in the way of business, I suppose.
Profes-edly pious people are singularly illiberal,
and often hold up tlieir wings too high out of the
mud. There was a wicked woman on an Orient
boat at whom a righteous maiden-lady talked in
vain, until at last the worldling got restive and in
retaliation invited the saint to afternoon-tea over
corkscrews in her cabin. Bub the holy damsel
refused, poker-backed. “Very well, then,” said
tnadame, “if you won't come to my cocktail party
I won’t go to your prayer party.”
Women who are tired of life, as the quack
advts. say, oughtn’t to go governessing. There
died the other day in N.S. W. a respected instruc-
tress of youth who didn’t go hence until she had
celebrated 100 birthdays. But fancy being a
governess for 100 years more or less I Imagine
how the plucky old lady must have had to crick
her neck to keep pace with the times ! How her
list' of' accomplishments must have expanded,
beginning with the harpsichord and the sampler,
and ending up as game as a pebble with the piano
and poker-work ! And what a treasure she must
have been in the evening of her life to the proprie-
tress of a husband with a roving eye who wanted
the dear girls educated ! If all governesses were
100 years old, how pleased all the married women
would be !
The next and much-needed social thrill Aus-
tralia will get is the visit of Prince Francis
Joseph, of Battenberg, brother-in-law to Princess
Beatrice, who sails (I mean the prince does) for
Australia shortly via the land of curry-powder.
At present, Australian society is like a novel with-
out a hero. Certainly, we have a handful of
governors, but they are all married and worried,
and lack the charm of novelty, and their staffs
of well-known aides-de-camp hardly infuse any
startling interest into the social plot, though the
aides do get married now and then. Captain
Forbes, for example, whose mamma-in-law (only
she wasn’t it then) sent round the invitations in the
new style—for all the world like the prospectus
you get at breakfast from Miss Blank, teacher of
calisthenics. I cannot say I admire the new style.
Marriage is too much of a trade now-a-days for
people to serve handbills round to the invites, in-
stead of gold-edged cards. But I mustn’t forget
that I am talking about the prince.
When his Highness arrives he will supply a
long-felt want. Princes are scarce in Aus-
tralia, thank goodness, and the prints of Prince
Alfred, who arrived here long before a young
thing like me can remember, are as fresh in
some quarters as though he set sail but yester-
day. One Victorian lady, whose parents enter-
tained the Duke, tells how the girls used to go
and kiss the handle of his door in the mornings
and fight for the privilege of cleaning his boots !
If Battenberg has anything like the same luck he
ought to have a fairly expressive time in our
midst.
The Xmas annuals are upon us and give good
value for one shilling this year. Publisher
Samuels, who always has something smart on the
market, is the deus-ex-machina of the Violet
Musical Album, got up in cool purple and gold,
and containing eleven original items by popular
Australian artistes, such as Madame Kellermann,
Caron, Harrison White, Aug. Juncker, and
so on—also, there are good portraits of well-known
actresses strewn about its advertising space. The
Violet is an altogether alluring number. Paling’s
Xmas annual goes well and strong this year,
“Two Little Girls in Blue,’’ and “Simon the
Cellarer,” are alone worth the money, and a book
that gives you songs like those at less than one
penny each (there are 16 numbers) must rush over
any counter.
A most original annual is the “Fitz-Stubbs
Musical Album,” got up in Xmas colors with a
portrait of the clever composer in a medallion.
Miss Fitz-Stubbs gave a matinee in the old Sydney
Club Rooms last Friday, when the sparkling con-
tents of the Album were gone through to every-
body’s loud approval; Mr. Harry Woods, Miss Ada
Baker and Mr. Fitzmaurice singing the songs,
with Miss Fitz-Stubbs at the piano. The
“Hobart” gavotte and the New Year’9s song
and chorus went especially well. These albums
are all excellent substitutes for Xmas cards.
I lately had a little pow-wow with Mrs. Had-
docks, the lady who wheeled hence to the Cab-
bage Garden and came back per mare, but no
secrets of the bicycle were divulged during the
chat. In appearance the redoubtable Mrs. M. is
not a startling advt. for female-cycling, to my
idea. She is a graceful light-weight with a poeti-
cally pale visage, though she protests that she has
put on flesh since she started wheeling and never
felt more fit in all her born days. Of course the lady
must know her constitution better than anybody
else, yet, judging by her delicate looks, I still
think that cycling is much too violent for my poor
dear sex. Mrs. Haddocks is an enthusiastic
believer in the benefits of bicycle riding, and cer-
tainly she ought to know after making a bagatelle
of a 600 miles’ run, but for all that I will stick to
my inexperienced opinion until I meet what looks
like a really healthy girl on a gridiron.
I don’t “barrack” for women on wheels for
more reasons than hygienic ones. No really-know-
ing woman ever puts herself into an unbecoming
position for one thing, and I haven’t seen a lady
yet who looked her best on a machine. In
knickers and hose, with a cheeky little cap and
small ankles, I grant you she might look per-
fectly killing; but the average woman on a
bicycle appears to try and make her sect
as dowdy as possible —in expiation, as it
were, of her advanced appearance straddling a
“ bike”—and so comes out self-effaced in skirts like
chaff-bags. And yet, on the other hand, a
woman’s an idiot to display the shapely nether
limbs for nothing when she might earn good gold
per week doing the same thing behind the floats.
So far, however, the Australee woman pedals
round in unaggressive skirts, but I don’t think we
are very far off the knicker stage, and I am willing
to wager that I can name the lady (a Melbour-
nian) who will be the first to ride down an Aus-
tralian Block, showing the clocks on her stock-
ings.
A lady doomed to high civic honors—she wears
{mrple feathers and isn’t afeard of Govmentouse—
ately attended an afternoon tea where every-
body was talking of the way Mr. Blank and Mrs.
Dash were “ carrying ” on. The hints grew
darker and darker, until Mrs. Coming Mayoress
charitably endeavored to put a stop to the scandal.
“ I assure you,” said she, “ there ain’t no ’arm in
it. It’s quite a Plutonic attachment!”
It must be true that the youth I spoke of last
week has married a W. and M. model. Somebody
taxed him with it and he turned scarlet and denied
it. That is the odd way the average man is con-
structed. If you accuse him of matrimony he
blushes with shame, but you might throw golden-
haired ladies in his teeth for a month, and he
would only look conceited all the while.
I have seen the kinetoscope. It is impossible
to describe the ingenuity of this marvellous in-
vention, but if you look at the stage through
the reverse end of your opera-glasses some night
you will get a fairish idea of what the kineto-
scope pictures look like. It has caught on tre-
mendously in Sydney.
Mr. Ernest Hoskins, a truly gifted conjuror,
ventriloquist and “spirit” expounder, who has
shown his clever bag of tricks at Government
House, to the expressed delight of Gov. Duff,
which is saying a great deal—gave a most enjoy-
able private stance at Sydney Coffee Palace on
Monday evening, when a goodly crowd rolled up
all agog to see Mrs. Mellon’s dodges turned seamy-
side out. Mr. Hoskins is a small, fair youth like
Cupid with a basin crop, and the oalm and deadly
way in which he went to work was very soothing
to the feelings of the sceptics present. His mock
stance was most successful. People who visit the
Mellon spookeries vowed that Mr. Hoskins*
Geordiea, Josephines and Cissies were far and
away more spooky spooks than Mrs. M.’s; and,
certainly, when Josephine undulated through
the curtains she was the most convincing ghostess
a sane person could wish to see. And don’t for-
get that Mr. Hoskins produced these phenomena
tied up in a black bag like a pound of soot, with
as many ropes tied to him as if he had been a
falling tree, and sealed round the neck like a mail-
bag by apparently reliable men. From any
point of view the test was a severe one, but Mr.
Hoskins made light of his prowess. “I have been
years inquiring into spiritualism,” he said, “and
have never yet seen anything incapable of scienti-
fic explanation.” There was a good audience,
men preponderating. The much-advertised Mr.
Henry was there— but the feature of the darkened
room was the position in which a certain lady sat.
The private cricket match, Press versus Par-
liament, was hit off at Sydney Association
Ground on Monday, when the press was most
emphatically worsted ; but, as nobody took the
game seriously, it didn’t amount to much. The
awful spectacle of a large fat gentleman (on the
Parliamentary side), dressed in white flannels,
and with big hands thrust into swollen cricket-
ing gloves, turned the affair into hilarious bur-
lesque. This large gentleman’s wicket-keeping
was absolutely unique. When he wasn’t flat on
his shirt-front swimming after the ball he was
catching it in the pit of the stomach, amid the
appreciative roar of the stands. He reminds me
of Lord _ Jersey, whom I once saw turn round
and receive a cricket-ball on his spine.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.

• • • •
The Melb. crowd failed to roll up as formerly
at the M.B.C.’s meeting, last Saturday, probably owing
to a well-founded belief that the strong wind blowing
would prevent good racing. The pace was generally
slow, and the finishes, with one or two exceptions, were
processions. The superiority of a sloped asphalt track
over the level grass one of the M.C. Ground was also
more than ever manifest, for three accidents, two of them
undeniably the result of the wheels skidding on the
slippery grass, occurred at the same spot. The other fall
occurred in the Mile Australian Championship, when
Arthur Turner, the sole Vic. representative left in the
final, and J. MTnnes (N.S.W.) came down heavily
together, the local man arising immediately to protest
against Megson, who, he alleges, crossed in front of him
without being the clear regulation length ahead. Turner’s
protest was, however, disallowed, but the crowd, nine-
tenths of whom were unable, by their position, to judge
the merits of the case, hooted Megson vigorously as he
pedalled home. Some more excusable bowlings were the
expressions of disgust levelled at all the riders in this
event for their tactics in literally crawling three-quarters
of the distance, MTnnes’ early spurt in the final being the
one laudable exception.
In the big event, four scratch men remain in the
final next Saturday, of whom Megson, on his performances
so far, is regarded by many as the deadest of dead birds.
Middleton, on the 180yds. mark, carried off his heat in a
manner which should shorten his odds considerably, while
Neil Matterson, the erstwhile sculler, who is alleged to be
backing himself vigorously (200yds), and Clinton (280yds),
were not pushed sufficiently to show their capabilities.
Taking one consideration with another, the general idea
is that the winner will oome from the above-mentioned—
1. M boson or Clinton.
2. Middleton.
3. Matterson.
J. A. MTnnes (no relation to the Sydneyite), of South
Melb., who is still left in the Austral, is a lad just turned
15, and promises, ere he is rauoh older, to perform well
off a shorter start than the limit (320yds) he wa* accorded.
Of individual riders throughout all races, Megson is with-
out a doubt the hero of the day. In addition to the mi'e,
he finished first in his Austral heat and first in his one
and a-half mile handicap heat; his run home in the lait-
named event, in which he had to pull up some 200yds
in the final lap, forcing applause from “even the ranks
of Tuscany.” Comic relief was provided by an obstao'e-
raoe in fancy costume and was welcome, for a couple of
the earlier accidents suggested at first something like
tragedy. The hlood-and-hair element, however, was en-
tirely absent, and the manner in which Qargurveitoh’s
trainer hauled his prostrate and apparently injured form
by the heels while its skull dragged with a series of grue-
some bumps along the track, was the one incident in the
afternoon’s sport which struck a responsive chord in the
hearts of the football-barraokers present.

Dear Bulletin, —There was as much woe as
wheel at the Melb. Bicycle Club’s meeting last Saturday.
3000 people and 1000 deadheads hooted the championship
heats all round the course. The second heat did the mile
|n 3min. 8 3-sth secs.—about 19 miles an hour. There
was one flat race on the programme—and it was the
race all day that wasn’t flak The M. 8.0. ask for sugges-
tions to improve their show—l propose that at their next
sports they have no cycle races at all,—Respectfully, Y.Z.
• « • •
Re the running of Carnage when “ out of form.”
Tub Bulletin must admit, on second thoughts, and in
justice to Mr. W. R. Wilson, that by scratching Carnage
for the Cup, even after his wretched performance in the
Melb. Stakes, the owner would have gained nothing but a
little ignorant abuse. The horse carried a heap of winter-
wager money—plenty of Wilson money, too, for that
matter—and although the “party” at last abandoned
hope of a win with Nada’s stable-companion, there was
good reason for letting him have another go on the off-
chance. It may he likewise urged that Carnage wasn’t
"out of form,” in the general acceptance of the term.
The horse had been thoroughly prepared and was seem-
ingly fit to travel as fast as of yore. But a Derby winner
who, whilst in the beat of physical health, loses'the dis-
position to gallop, and can’t be induced to gallop at home
or abroad, is, from a practical point of view, the most
“ out of form ” beast that a punter drops his money on.
Granting that the case of Carnage is exceptional, Tub
Bulletin can still point to dozens of modern oases in
which Australian “crack” horses were pulled out for
races without being " fancied by the stable,” a practice
almost unknown among those English owners whose
colors are followed by the general public.

Z Carbine is to be sold at the annual sale after
Australian Cup meeting ; and notice is given thus early
to give American and Indian buyers a chance. As there
are very few’ Australian buyers, outside W. R. Wilson and
Hordern, who could afford to buy Carbine, it is very
probable he will leave Australia. Now, Sam Hordern 1
* * * •
The new bowler is always a “wonder” if he
happens to come off at the outset, but it is the old bowler
who, in an unsensational way, generally pans out best at
the finish. Howell’s 5 wickets for 44 against the English-
men (Ist innings) at Sydney overshadowed Peel’s modest
8 for 25 against N.S.W. But when the match was over
Peel had bagged 8 wickets for 139, and Howell’s average
had fallen to 5 for 61. The five test matches will prob-
ably prove that Turner is still the champion Australian
trundler.
• • • •
It is time that cricket authorities made a
sensible rule as to catches. A fieldsman who doesn’t hold
a catch for three seconds before tossing the ball up again
should be bound to hold it for the second time. If he
gets only a half grasp of the ball in the first instance
jerks it hastily into*the air and fails to grip it at the next
try, the " catch” should count as a miss. A fair catch is
always held long enough to establish its genuineness, and
the throwing up of the ball is a distinct afterthought.
Yet we have such stuff as this from newspaper reporters:
“ Richardson seemed to make a pretty catch and then
dropped the ball in the act of drawing back his hand to
throw it up,” or “ Farquhar caught the ball and threw it
on the ground.’’ The ball that is dropped or thrown
down (!) within a couple of seconds has never been held
at all.

Lyons, Darling and Reedman. Anyway, it is a relief to

South Australia won the Interprovincial cricket-
match by 10 wickets. Victoria made 252 on its first, and
134 on its second innings, a total of 386. Harry, who
made 35 and 45 on his two appearances, was the most
consistent performer ; Trott made 38 and 21; R. M’Leod
made 46 in his first innings and altogether failed to come
off in the second ; and Worrall, who scored 47 in the first
innings, went to pieces for 2in the next. The S.A. men
made 358 in one innings, Dyer’s 102 and Gillen's 94 not
out being the biggest features in the score. Giffen took
12 Victorian wickets altogether—in fact, the match con-
sisted mostly of Giffen in one form or another.

The cricket match England against 22 of New
England at Armidale (N.S.W.) ended, through want of
time, in a draw. England made 67 in the first innings,
and 197 in the second, M’Laren (49) and Ford (44) being
top scorers. The local 22 had a long and melan-
choly record of blanks, but managed to compile
147 all told. Stumps were drawn a few’ minutes
after the beginning of New England’s second innings,
and the local men were thus rescued from an
unpromising situation. The Englishmen complain bit-
terly that playing against 22, in the ordinary acceptation
of the term, meant that their opponents were allowed 22
batsmen, but that only eleven should take the field, and
that the New Englanders, by sending their whole force
into the field, were running the thing into the ground.
Which was possibly true, but the question is open to a lot
of argument.

Rowing clubs, like nations, have their rise,

example. Five years ago this club formed, out of a
brilliant junior eight and three old senior men, a combin-
ation well-nigh invincible, and, for three seasons, it
carried off both the eights and fours with ease. But the
Man with the Scythe is invariably disregarded by all
athletes, who always deem themselves immortal and con-
sider that because Smith was a magnificent oar in ’B4 he
must necessarily be so in '94. This sentiment, coupled
with a liberal amount of Brotherbiliisra, would wreck a
crew of eight Stanburys, as it has wrecked the Y. Y., for a

When N.S.W. law pleases it does not recognise
betting. When it also pleases it does—peculiarly. At
Sydney Water Police Court a punter prosecuted a layer
for having obtained 6s. under false pretences. Layer
offered Bto 1 ; punter put up ss. and won. Layer offered
ss. back ; punter wanted 455. or nil. Hence the trouble.
Beak Edwards ruled that punter was only entitled to 55.,
and discharged layer, who was subsequently arrested
under the elastic Vag.

“Will eggs keep, packed in sawdust?’
asks a Leader correspondent. They ought to;
see how the average ballet girl keeps.
The oldest provincial paper in S.A. is the
Border Watch, first published at Mount Gambier
in 1861. It is a bi-weekly, and is still about the
best and most prosperous of the country sheets.
A loyal Southern contemporary, speak-
ing of a visit of the Duchess of Teck to a London
hospital, alludes to that “ great ” lady as a “ ray
of sunshine.’’ Her ladyship weighs 18st. in her
evening-dress. Fortunately, this _“ ray ’’ does not
seem to have fallen on any of the invalids.
A Melb. deadbeat having learned on a
Friday evening that four large boilers would next
day be temporarily deposited on a secluded piece
of land, went around the fraternity and let out
the sleeping accommodation at Id. a night—cash
'down—to some 30 others of the profession.
It was seriously proposed in the Queensland
Parliament that the State should take over the
Mt. Morgan gold. “It belongs to the State and
yet the State makes a present of it to certain indi-
viduals.” So said Jack Hamilton in supporting
the proposal. The men who voted against the
State paying members of Parliament a living
wage voted to continue giving Mt. Morganaires
all the gold they can take out of the land —with
the tiny deduction made by dividend-tax.
The “Dublin jackeen” wasoysteringalong
a foreshore in Middle Harbor, Sydney. “These
oysters are very small,” said he. “Yes, that’s so,’
said the old Cornstalk, “but y’see, we can’t afford
to feed ’em.” “D’you feed oysters?” “Of
course you do. They wanter be fed twice a day if
you’re fattening them for the market.” “ What
d’you feed ’em with?” “Oatmeal.” _“ Go on.
“ Where have you been to all your life and not
know that? You know Woodward, the big
Sydney oyster-grower. He has a great under-
ground plantation of ’em, and his man has to go
round with a big bucketful of their gruel twice a
day.” “But how does he feed ’em?” “ With a
big tablespoon; two tablespoonfuls to each
■oyster.” “But how does he get it into their
mouths?” “Why, you silly, they open their
shells directly they hear his footsteps, and if he
'happens to be a minute or two behind the regular
feed-time, there’s such a clapping with the open-
ing and shutting of shells that you’d think there
was a hallfull of nigger-minstrels playing the
ibones.” “Begorra, but it’s a wonderful place
; and the oyster’s a wonderful insect and bates all.”
So far, there are no pawn-shops or second-
Ihand dealers in Tonga, Samoa, Fiji, or
Hebriles, In any of these places, pawn-shops
\w mid no doubt be rushed, but no one would ever
ire leem a pledge or attend the auction sales. An
li dander, as a rule, does not treasure relics, and
ithe more pawn-tickets he or she could string
iround the neck or leg, the greater and mightier
ithe chief or chieftainess. The dealers would like-
wise be rushed, but they would hardly sell any-
thing, as the natives only like brand-new things.
The successors of Bray Bros., the well-
known George-street glass-merchants, advertise a
special clearing sale, at the lowest prices ever
known in Sydney. In their fine collection of
Parian statuary and terra-cotta figures are some
of the cheapest, choicest, chastest Christmas-boxes
imaginable.
Melbournian : “Merely walking over the
short block between Russell and Swanston-streets,
on one side, I yesterday counted four men and
four women, all selling War Ckys. These eight
strong people were uniformed officers, supported
by public subscription, and doing work which
would be better done by one small boy.”
The astonishing illness of a Sydney boot-
manufacturer is accounted for, and he is now
rapidly regaining his usual color. He turned
green on reading the testimonials to the extra-
ordinary success of Ellis’s self-measurement
system, under which boots unsurpassed for price,
fit, and quality are posted to any part of Aus-
tralasia from W. Ellis’s Intercolonial Boot
Factory, Haymarket, Sydney ; or Hunter-street,
Newcastle.
A medical item. On the N.S.W.-Q. bor-
der, lately, a man was bitten by a snake, and
after the doctor had injected ammonia he told the
patient's friends “not to let him go to sleep for a
bit, but to walk him about.” They did walk him
about—until the unfortunate was nearly dead
with fatigue. Then they led him by the nose with
hot pincers, while one behind pricked him gently
with a pitchfork. They kept this up one night
and half a day, and finally tied a cow-bell round
his neck. Yet the man survived both snakebite
and treatment.
The great-Australian-adjective yarn with
frills on : —The newchum parson was collecting
church-funds and a crowd of jokers pointed out to
him a big fellow leaning against the hotel veran-
dah. “ Try him. That’s Mr. Tyson, the million-
aire.” The poor shepherd bailed him up and
asked him to aid the cause. “ Look pa’son,
I ain’t Mr. gory Tyson, and I ain’t an Episco—
gory—palian, nor a Uni —gory —tarian, nor a
Congre—gory —gationalist. But I’m an inde—
gory—pendent se—crimson —lector from Bunge-
blessed —worgorai, and—hie I—cumanava drink.”
Photographers, as well as other people,
have good reason to rejoice and be exceeding glad
that Xmas only comes once a year. Any man,
woman, or young person smitten with the first
symptoms of the disease, to say nothing of the
large army of chronic sufferers therefrom, will do
wisely to resist and flee from the temptation of
even looking at the latest importation of new
goods just unpacked at Baker and Rouse’s ware-
house, 375 George-street. All the necessaries and
most of the luxuries pressed into the service of
the art are to be found there pretty well all the
year round, but the more recent additions to the
stock cover all the newest inventions and up-to-
date dodges, for soothing one’s friends or crucifying
enemies on a sensitised plate. Field and studio
cameras of every make and design, the thirty-five
shilling snap-shot for rapid and unerring execu-
tion by land or sea, brilliant finders, concentrated
energy in the shape of shutters and lenses by all
makers of renown, are just being drafted into their
respective corners after being branded with the
hieroglyphics of the firm. The only way to avoid
the discovery of what those characters implj
is to avoid the locality ; but for the curious the
address is Baker and Rouse, 375 George-street,
i Sydney.

STATUTORY DECLARATION.
1 THOS. MUDIMAN, Blaster Tailor, of 547 George-street, Sydney, in the Colony of
New South Wales, do hereby solemnly and sincerely declare as follows
Whereas I suffered severely from a very troublesome affection of the Nerves, which
affected me so much that I was quite unable to attend to my business. I tried several doctors
and many remedies, but all of no avail. Whereas I, as a last hope, obtained some of Herr
Rassmussen’s Purely Herbal “Alpaline
Vitality Pills,” which I hereby solemnly and
sincerely declare Completely Cured Me with-
in a few weeks, and although this is over five
years ago I have remained well ever since.
The Alfaline Pills also cured my wife, and
I make this solemn declaration conscientiously
believing the same to be true. . _ T

The well-known and popular representative
of the Sydney Bulletin, a gentleman whose
testimony carries special weight, writes thus ;
To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir, -I think it my duty to inform yon
that a course of your Alfalme Vitality Pills
acted very beneficially on my nervous system,
and, in consequence, I have recommended them
to many friends, who have all been cured Ly
their use. —Yours, R. A. LUCKHAM.
A Magistrate Cured of Nervousness
and Biliousness.
160 Elizabeth-st., Melb,, July 18, 1892.
Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure to inform
you that a course of your Alfaline Pills com-
pletely cured me of a severe case of biliousness,
wind and nervousness. I may also mention
that several of my friends to whom I have
recommended your remedies have derived great
benefit from them; therefore, I consider you
are deserving of success, which I do most
heartily wish you.—Yours gratefully,
A. HARRIS, J.P.
A Lady Cured of General Debility.
Herr Rassmussen. March 15th, 1894.
Sir, —I hereby beg to certify that having
been a sufferer from General Debility of the
Nervous System for over seven years, and
having tried without success several of the
leading doctors both in Sydney and Melbourne,
I was advised to try your Alfaline Remedies.
I am thankful I did so, for after a few courses
of the Alfaline Remedies I am now completely
cured, and I shall be most happy to recom-
mend your remedies to anyone suffering as I
was. Thanking you for your courtesy and
the uniform patience with which you have
treated me, allow me to say that you can
make what use you may think proper of this.
Wishing you every success, allow me to remain,
yours, CATHERINE HAGERMAN.

require for the money you have, and you do not
desire even to contemplate the possibility of being
called upon for more. If you BUY OF US you
will get all you determined to secure, and have a
bit left for something else. Also, you will get the
best of everything—the goods of standard manu-

With an ordinary tape measure determine the width
round the joints AA, round the instep 88, round heelCC,
round the ankle DD ; next ascertain the length and width
of tread by placing the foot on a sheet of paper, and
running a lead pencil round the heel and toes. Cut the
outline thus made with a scissors, and enclose with the
other measurements, stating whatsizeyou generally take,
what are your peculiarities-a weak ankle, perhaps a pet
corn, ingrowing nails, or a blooming bunion. All these
little matters attended to, if you have a long thin foot, or
a short thick one, with very high instep, send to ELLIS S,

Dear Bulletin, Your correspondent,
*' M, Rule,” who wrote to you about disem-
bowelling scrub cattle in C.Q. and N.fy, did not
tell you all. It is also a common practice there to
tango up alongside a beast in a thick scrub, out
enough hide from him to make a whip, plait it,
fix it on a handle, and drive the beast home with
it.—Yours, Another Liar.
A N.S.W. country correspondent :
Work is being turned out of N.S.W. Government Print-
ing Office in competition with country printers at shock-
ingly low prices. The Municipal Council here wanted 100
copies of their bye-laws (just gazetted). They asked me for
k price and obtained a price from the Govt, printer. They
contained 120,000 ens. Mr. Potter did the 100 copies for
15s. (fifteen shillings), which would just about pay for
the binding and cutting. Why Govt, should be called
upon to print bye-laws for a council at a dead loss, is
beyond my ken.
Cable : “ On the fall of Port Arthur, the
Japanese captured Reuter’s special reporter on the
ground that he was acting in the service of the
Chinese.” The Japs are not so civilised as the
Turks. During the last Rnsso-Turkish war AH
Pasha bamboozled the London newspaper corres-
pondents by ostentatiously preparing to throw a
bridge over the Danube. They reported the fact,
and 50,000 Russians were kept idle for a month
waiting for the expected crossing.
B. Mountcastle and Sons, of 332 George-
street, Sydney, who are sole agents for Cooksey’s
London hats, have laid in an extra quantity of
these celebrated belltoppers for the Christmas
season. John Bull’s belltopper is his god ; as h«
plods through his old, grimy, fog-stricken capital
he stops every half-mile at a hatter’s to have it
ironed ; he worships the nap on it, and yearns
with a holy fervour over the beautiful curliness of
its brim. Therefore, the bell-topper naturally
reaches its highest perfection in London, and the
fact that Cooksey’s hats are celebrated even there
is a sufficient proof of their magnificence. Mount-
castle and Sons also deal in white troppo helmets,
warranted sun and rain proof; straw hats of the
male and female variety ; ladies’ sailor hats, Terai
bats and puggarees, and every other description
■that a civilised community can possibly ask for.
'Further, they are manufacturers as well as im-
porters, and so the man whose abnormal head
•can’t be suited with the ready-made article can
have his brain measured and his hat made on the
premises.
Editor Bulletin, —.Be your article on the
“Wairarapa wreck.” Years ago, Capt. MTntosh
had charge of a steamer in the South Seas. Late
one afternoon, when quite close to the passage
that levds through a certain coral reef, a hurricane
came suddenly from seaward, and the rolling of
the breakers on the reef was so heavy that an
unbroken line of foam reached across ahead of the
ship. Darkness coming on, the entrance could
not be seen. The vessel was too close in to steam
round and be brought head-on to it, so all the
captain could do was to go full-speed astern for
eight or nine hours till the wind abated. The
poor engineer completely lost his bead with
fright, and raced round the deck Bible in hand.
Mac said to him, “ Why don’t you behave like a
man, and not alarm the passengers?” He refused
to be pacified, so the captain seized him, rushed
him into his room, and locked him there and went
to his place again on the bridge ; but the old
iellow bashed away at the door until he had to be
let out. I mention this to show that in the pre-
sence of danger. Captain MTntosh was not a man
likely to lose his presence of mind. Re your
“Significant Facts ’’ in another column ; they are
not so significant, after all, and I’ll tell you why.
The crew of a ship are used to a sea-life and its
dangers ; passengers are not. The crew are used
to tlie ship, and can find their way about as well
at night as in the day-time ; the passengers are all
strange to the ship—most likely some had never
been on deck all the passage—and when the
moment of danger arrived were completely lost
and knew not the best place to make for. The
shipwrecked woman was right when she said,
“ God help the poor passengers : the sailors are
used to it.”— Shellback.
Sydney D.T. announces that, owing to the
dry weather, the yield from the Central Cumber-
land (N.S.W.) orchards “ will fall 100 per cent,
below expectations.”

Professor TODD, Anderson’s College Medical

munication on his part to Messrs. Bosisto & Co.,
writes ;
It is a lishter, clearer, and more ethereal oil than any
I have hitherto used, besides being free from the heavy
nauseous odour characteristic of others.
This is particularly noticeable when the oil is sprayed
into the throat.
It is very palatable when taken internally, which places
it above other preparations, and considerably enhances its
value.

“Ghosts”: And its Critics.
Dear Bulletin, —Your correspondents “ Walter
Clay ” and “ Arthur Bray ” have fallen into the
very common error of instituting comparisons
between the productions of the poets. How can
you compare poems? Lovers of poetry are like
drinkers «f alcohol. Of the latter, some like long
draughts of light wine or beer, others strong
wines out of small glasses, others, still, the fiercer
brandy or whisky. Now, which of the above
drinks is best ? As one who likes to hear “the
canakin clink ” whenever it holds any sort of
decent liquor, I answer all are good if pure.
Similarly, the “pure gold of poetry” must be
accepted by the world as current coin, no matter
into what shape or of what size it may have
been minted. “Walter Clay” likes brevity—
the poetic “nip”—others love the poetic
“schooner.” Who would blot out one line of
“Childe Harold” because of its length? “Ghosts”
is a fine poem, and so is “ Crossing the Bar.” And
both Gordon and Kendall are poets. Although in
many respects imperfectly educated, I, like Long-
fellow’s young Sicilian, have “read the poets o’er
and o’er,” and I apply a test to their productions,
which several illustrious men have assured me is,
in their opinion, a perfectly natural and correct
one : If the mention, oral or written, of a writer’s
name at once calls to my mind something that I
have considered striking in his poems, I always
hold him to be a true poet. The mere mention of
Longfellow, whom “ Arthur Bray ” puts out of
court so summarily, conjures up a mental picture
of how —
The grey alligator glided
Into the still bayou.
I never knew that the not very famous David
Christie Murray was a poet till I read in The Bul-
letin “The Meditations of Michael Tergovitch—
Bound for the Gallows.” Since that time the
sight of Murray’s name in a newspaper brings to
my lips the lines commencing—
Let the snake live out her damned ophidian life,
And rear the little brood she loves ;
Were I a snake there should be some insistance on snake-
rights, &c., &c.,
and for me Murray has become one of the Im-
mortals.
I think it wrong to use the terms “greater
poets,” “minor poets.” If a man is a poet his
metrical productions are poetry in the same sense
that pure gold is gold refined. Some poets crush
a larger yield than others, or, to pursue my pre-
vious metaphor, have a larger poetic brew, but
comparisons cannot be made. Their productions
are true poetry or nothing. As for those who try
to be poets and cannot achieve the distinction —
failing to beat the music out— their dirgeis written:
that his lately-published “The Dead Infant ” is a
perfect poem in the same sense that “ Ghosts ” is
a fine poem. The lines —
Alas for those who never sing,
But die with all their music in them.
Just a last word in favor of Victor Daley, since
the poem of the obscure Ropes has been given
deserved prominence. I may point out the fact
The foolish hopes and fond
That cheat us to the last
Thou heedest not, beyond
All these things thou hast passed
are from the true poetic ore-shoot, and confirm the
opinion that I, with many others, have long held
—that Daley is a true poet. Consider the whole
poem well and mark how the slightest trace of the
Sunday-school mawkishness, which is almost
always present in verse treating of this and
kindred subjects, is not discoverable. The gentle
cadence of this beautiful poem seems like a softly-
murmured answer from “a high hidden land” to
the question, “Is it well with the child ? ” “It is
well.” Let us take heed that we native lovers of
poetry who profess to be ever on the watch for
the advent of our poets, do not overlook the one
who dwells in our midst while he is yet here. —
Yours, Jerome Darnet, Gould’s Country, Tas,
Dear Bulletin, —You don’t quite give the
congratulatory telegrams sent by Purves to bank-
manager Cotton, and Sleath, M.L.A., to Surgeon
O’Hara. Purves’s wire is said to have been :
“Well done, Cotton. Hit the brute in a softer
place next time.” When Purves was bashed,
Sleath repeated it word for word, only changing
the name. It reminds one of Napoleon 111. and
Francis Joseph of Austria. In ’66 the latter asked
Napoleon to help him against the Prussians.
Napoleon answered : “Do you think I will ally
myself with a corpse?” In '7O Napoleon, after
his first defeats, asked help from Austria. Francis
Joseph answered: “Do you think I will ally
myself with a madhouse?” —X.X.

THE MIGHT HAVE ESCAPED ANY DAY.
' There was once a man, who, on account of his
i religious convictions, was arrested by a despotic
government and thrown into prison. Looking at
the strong stone walls that shut him in, he natur-
ally concluded that he must spend the rest of his
days in this lonely and dismal place. Yet wretched
as the prospect was, there was some comfort in the
thought that he was a victim of oppression, and
• not undergoing punishment as a violator of any
good and righteous law. All the same, he would
• have been glad to get out, as he had a right to do
if he could.
Nevertheless, there he stayed and languished for
sixteen years. At nearly the end of that period
it occurred to him one day to climb up on a
projecting stone in the wall and take a peep
through the window above his head. He did so,
and found the iron bars removable and the sash
not fastened. An idea struck him, of course.
Why not escape ? He opened the window, jumped
six feet to the ground, and left that district
immediately. He might have done so at any time
during his protracted occupancy of the place, if he
had only been blessed with a more inquiring mind
and not taken so much for granted.
Now here comes an incident both like and unlike
(that of the martyr ; like it because there was loss
•of free action, unlike it because the sufferer was
mot imprisoned as be was.
The story is in the form of a letter, one of those
betters we all prefer to get—short and made up of
•short words. The writer, a lady, says : “For the
ilas't sixteen years I have been greatly afflicted
'with bilious complaints and weakness. I was
always tired, weak, and low-spirited. I had no
appetite, and when food was placed before me
■I could not touch it. For days I could scarcely
-eat anything. At times I was troubled with
sickness and heaving at the stomach, spitting up a
sthvck phlegm. I had a troublesome cough, with
dpain at my chest and difficulty of breathing. I
•got very weak and could scarcely drag myself in
and out of the shop. In December, 1891, I began
to take a medicine I had heard well spoken of by
many of my customers, called Mother Seigel’s
Curative Syrup. After I had taken only a few
doses I felt relief, and I had not used the medicine
for a fortnight when I felt better than I had done
for years. Thus encouraged, I kept on with it
until I was restored to good health. My son,
Arthur, had suffered off and on for a year from
pain and heaviness after meals, with a sinking
feeling at the pit of the stomach. He was induced
to try Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup, and the
result was the same as in my own case. I know
several persons in this district who have been
cured by the Syrup after all other means had
failed. You are at liberty to publish my letter if
you think it might be of benefit to others afflicted
as I was. —Yours truly, (signed) (Mrs.) M. Ward,
174, Ilkeston-road, Radford, Nottingham, April
Ist,. 1892.”
We congratulate Mrs. Ward upon her deliver-
ance from a distressing and dangerous disease.
What a pity she did not sooner learn how easily
and certainly she could be cured. Sixteen years
is too large a slice out of one’s life to be spent in
bodily and mental misery. Very few of us can
have wealth in any case, but health should be a
blessing common and universal as sunshine. And
it might be if everybody knew how to preserve it
when they possess it, or to regain it when lost.
This lady’s disease was of the digestive organs—
•indigestion and dyspepsia—the most afflictive and
perilous of all, because it involves every function of
the body, scattering its poison at every point
through the medium of the blood. Nearly all
ailments are but the differently-named results and
symptoms of this prolific parent of evil. That the
remedy site mentions should have cured her will
not surprise those who know its well-founded
reputation. Many worse cases constantly yield
to it.
Our friend the martyr abode in his cell a weary
time because he was ignorant of the simple way
out. If the reader of these lines is a captive to
disease he has no excuse for remaining so. In her
short and honest letter our correspondent points
to the open door.
JACK CADE.
A TRIBUTE TO THE MEMORY OF A MUCH-MALIGNED PATRIOT.
(See “ Henry VI." Second Part. Act IV. Scene X.)
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Bard Divine, whose fame like daylight
Over all the earth is spread !
Shakespeare, whose bright name doth ray light
Through the dusk of ages dead !
Thou oouldst paint a portrait rarely,
Yet, in sooth, I am afraid
That thy pencil wrought unfairly
On the picture of Jack Cade.
Here, where old gum-trees funereal.
Like to ancient tatter’d rakes,
Shake and sigh—a scene ideal
For thy melancholy Jaques*—
In a land where Puck for pleasure
May, while girdling earth, have stood ;
I am reading thee at leisure,
In a calm judicial mood.
And I think thy mediseval
Social views suit not this clime—
There has been a great Upheaval
Of the Masses since thy time.
When thy pen, like claw of tercel,
Tore the Early Democrat —
Was it proof that Universal
Wisdom lodged beneath thy hat?
Here I pause—in time to shun light
Words of treason ’gainst a king.
Thou with vision strong as sunlight
Wert not blind to one sole thing.
No ! In manner Rabelaisian—
Eulogy ironical —
Thou didst suit to the occasion,
And the age, thy words withal.
This belief I shall abide in.
Holding it I am content
To accept with calmness Iden,
Huge beef-witted ’Squire of Kent;
And can find excuse for pardon
For the ill mind he betrayed,
Gasconading in his garden
O’er the corpse of poor Jack Cade.
’Tis a scene my fancy oft in
Idle hours presents to me,
The quaint, old-world garden-croft in
Kent, the county of the bee.
And while thus my thoughts run riot
Figures rise mine eyes before-
Champions that have lain full quiet
These four hundred years and more.
Cade, the famished little phantom
With lords’ blood upon his hands.
Once again, as bold as bantam
Cock in Iden’s leek-bed stands,
And, with proud, pugnacious air crows,
Though, unkempt and gaunt, he looks
Like a General of Scarecrows
Beaten in a war with Rooks.
Hear him : “ Like an ostrich, iron
Thou shall eat; and like a pin
My sword swallow.” To admire an
Elf like this is, sure, no sin—
“ Meat these five days I’ve not eaten,
Yet come five, and, by the Mass,
If I leave ye not dead-beaten—
May I never more eat grass !”
Hear the other, who took pride in
The high honor in him bred—
Alexander Ajax Iden—
-“Now it never shall be said
An Esquire of Kent ” —a wombat!—
“ Took such odds—it shall not be !
A poor, famished man to combat,
Pray observe the size of me !
“ Look ! my foot, and arm, and leg are
Thrice as big as thine, poor thief !
Why, thou starving little beggar,
I am bold and full of beef
Little danger ran he, being
What he was, with his great blade
Swung by brawn-fed arm—in freeing
“The unconquered soul of Cade.”
See how Iden, fiercely loyal,
Hies to Court for his reward,
Hot-foot, hungering for royal
Blessing on his bloody sword !
Small tho fear that he Would tarry,
When Cade’s head in hand he bore—
Sure he never had to carry
Such a weight of brains before I
By his Sovereign he was knighted
In the fashion of the day,
And went home to Kent delighted.
To improve his backsword play. ...
Democrats ! Mark well the sequel!
Cade your protomartyr was,
And he fought that fight unequal
For your Order and your Cause.
Still you fight, as erstwhile Cade did
Fight, and hunger conquers you!
But not always God-unaided
Shall they fight whose cause is true.
Therefore, fill your glasses fairly,
Though the toast be long delayed,
We shall drink it, standing squarely—
“ To his memory—Jack Cade !”
VICTOR J. DALEY.

ANARCHISM
UP TO DATE.
The average person’s conception of Anarchism is
of a piece with his other conceptions—a compound
of selfishness, prejudice, and ignorance. These
qualities form the sole basis of the judgments of a
large number of “ respectable ” people—from the
laborer turned employer, who- becomes the worst-
tyrant of the class from which he sprang, to the
politician who plunders the public treasury to
secure the return to Parliament of bis own par-
ticular pal. These gentry. The Bulletin’s Fat
Men, the typical bourgeois, while cheating one
another in the name of Business and saeri ficing
the proletariat in the name of Law and Order,
unite in blind, unreasoning hatred of any move-
ment which seems, to . threaten the fruit of their
lying, cozening, bullying, and thieving, and
present in, every age a solid opposition to schemes
of progress, which, aim at lessening social in-
equalities. If they have the capacity to realise-
the difference between various plans for the
amelioration of the condition.of the masses, they
rarely, trouble to use it. All new ideas seem to-
them but confused versions-of the great idea of
Change, which they, are at all hazards engaged to-
combat. Views of abstract justice or injustice,,
right or wrong, have no place in their philosophy.
“Justice” is to them a machine which they
employ to bawl “ Sedition!” “Blasphemy!” “ Dis-
loyalty !” “ Sacrilege !” and similar cant-words at
the mildest dissenters from conventional beliefs.
“Right” is their power to imprison those dis-
senters, to .flog them, and finally to hang them;,
while “ Religion,” in grotesque mockery, salves
possible qpalms with the assurance that a bourgeois-
God, propitiated ty the homage of the collection-
plate, will adjust any errors in “ mansions beyond!
the aides.”
» * «
It is not surprising, then, to find an ex-Minister
of N.S. Wales lumping “Socialism, Anarchism,
Communism,” as similar objects of detestation in i.
a recent burst of aristocratic invective. Yet any-
body acquainted merely with the dictionary--'
meaning of the words should know that Socialism
and Anarchism are as far asunder as Repub-
licanism and knighthood; and that, at least-
historically, Communism is a very
thing from either. But the utterance was*;
characteristic of the bourgeoisie, which does not
take the trouble to understand anything, to
acquaint itself with anything, but thinks with its
belly and foams into furious speech whenever
instinct teaches it that its belly is in danger. It
is not helped when somebody points out that
Socialism means the extension of the sphere of
government and the regimentation of society to a
much greater extent than at present, while
Anarchism means the destruction of all govern-
ment, and insists, with Diderot, that Nature made
neither servant nor master, and laws should
neither be imposed nor obeyed. The bourgeois
intelligence has no trouble in assailing contraries,
even when considered merely as ideals, with the
same vituperation. “ There were once,” says
Hans Andersen, “ three green peas who lived in a
pod. They were green, and the pod was green,
and they thought all the world was green.”
Similarly, the bourgeoisie is mean, and it lives on
a mean, and it decrees that all the world must
limit aspirations to its mean standard. The
expectation is vain.
• • •
In contradistinction to Socialism, which preaches
duty to the State, Anarchism preaches duty to
one’s-self. The contest is the old contest between
altruism and egoism, with the proviso that the
altruism is mingled with a good deal of selfishness
and the egoism is characterised rather by a denial
of selfishness. The Socialist says, in effect,
“ Help others, that others may help you.’’ The
Anarchist prefers to say, “Be yourself, and you
will help others.” The motto of Anarchism
might indeed be Polonius’ precept to Laertes :
This above all—to thine ownself be true ;
And it must follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
THE FAT MAN.—The True Leprosy.
The conception of the anarchist is undoubtedly
the higher. Socialism is in essence compulsory,
Anarchism is voluntary ; and the view of a human
society which considers its members as merely
specialised parts of a huge machine, and exacts
from every individual abject obedience to the
mandates of a central authority, is less noble,
less exalted than the view which holds that society
should be merely the optional co-operation of in
dependent units, each conscious of complete free*
dom to do as he pleases, yet so self-controlled ..s
to do only actions not conflicting with the freedom
of others. This is the ideal evolutionary
anarchists, who hopeor believe that in the gradual
progress of humanity the leading-strings of law
will by-and-by become unnecessary; and, whatever
our sense of the difficulties in the of realisa-
tion, it must remain the ideal for which, beyond
all others, it is best for humanity to strive.
• * *
Enlightened anarchists recognise that their
millennium cannot be brought about by force, but
must await the slow process of events. They hold
that the gradual diffusion of correct ideas, and
the removal by degrees of the old savage leaven of
selfishness, are the only things from which per-
manent improvement is to be expected. They
have learnt from history the lesson that
force implies recoil, and that the last state
of a society unprepared for sudden change
may be worse than the first. But with
the anarchist movement, as with all others,
is associated a vanguard of hasty and impatient
spirits who are not content with the slow advance
of evolution, “Anarchy might be postponed to
the 30th century,” say these, “if we didn’t break
a little glass now and again. A man can’t move
ahead without shifting his legs, and revolutions
shift the legs of society. They turn things upside
down for a while, but when the ruins are so fertile
it is pusillanimous to dread them.’’ This, of
course, is a direct defence of the bomb. Evolu-
tionists, on the other hand, say that “government
by bomb would be the worst conceivable form of
government, an intangible despotism, destitute
even of that cynical audacity which leads the
despot to brave openly the fury he excites. The
strictest respect for human life must incontestably
be the basis of any system of social ethics. The
bomb is the direct antithesis of Anarchism, and
the veritable anarchist doctrine has the more
reason to deprecate it because up to now it is the
anarchist agitation that has suffered the most
from its introduction.”
• • •
Language like this is dubbed rose-water reason-
ing by the revolutionary anarchists who count as
martyrs Ravachol, Vaillant, and Caserio. Their
creed is summed up in “ Father Duchesne’s
Song,” sung by Ravachol on the way to the
guillotine. This famous chant, which The Bul-
letin now ventures to translate, runs as follows :
This hymn of Anarchy (taken togetherwi'ffi
the pictures here reproduced from the sup-
pressed organ of French anarchism, “Le Pi?i n-
Peinard) gives a very adequate idea of tie-
spirit which European Governments are trying:
to stifle by an execution or two. It is m
spirit as old as authority, and it has found vent inn

numerous historical rebellions and revolutions.
Anarchism is only a new name, not a new thing ;
but Governments can never from experience.
Their first thought is always to crush down op-
position, no matter how well justified or how
solidly based. Nine times in ten they succeed,
thanks to the ad vantages given them by the pos-
session of power and by the generally conservative
tendencies of the mass of any population; the
tenth time, to their surprise, they find their
authority torn to shreds and themselves extin-
guished with something less of formality than it
has been their custom to concede to opponents.
Yet every new Government, as soon as it
feels itself firmly planted, proceeds in the same
fashion to weight down the safety-valve a
the first sound of escaping steam, and is ii,
variably astonished when, sooner or late
comes the inevitable explosion. Once gover V
ments learn that their safety lies in redressing;,
not in repressing, grievances, the seed of revolution
will never germinate again. But while they
regard it as their duty to fortify monopoly, to
maintain tyranny, to perpetuate class privileges ;
while they are content that the sweets of life fall
always to those who sit in the sunshine at the top
of the tree, and its bitter lees to those who sweat
iin the shadow at the root; so long will the grim
spectre of Anarchy stand always at their feasts.
Modern anarchy is intensified by neurotic civilisa-
tion, and made more dangerous by the destructive
powers which civilisation provides. But its
essence, now, as of old, is the divine instinct of
equality—equality of opportunity if not of reward,
the divine craving for freedom, the divine hatred
if injustice. The effects of revolutionary anarchy
—the conspiracies, the bomb-throwings, the assass-
inations—are indeed execrable. But what of its
causes—starvation, fraud, cruelty, tyranny, ini-
quity unspeakable—would these be less hateful if
custom Lad not made them so familiar?
# # *
Felix Dubois, in “ Le Peril Anarchiste ” (trans-
lated into English by Ralph Derechef, and pub-
lished by Fisher Unwin), gives a striking summary
of the history and tendencies of modern Anarch-
ism. As an active, organised force, it is not yet
20 years old ; but it has already put forth an
immense propaganda, and thoroughly alarmed
•the Latin nations of Europe. The German races,
more patient, characteristically sluggish, do not
take kindly to Anarchism. It has made no pro-
gress in England, and little in Germany, where
Socialism seems much more popular. The Slavs
*eem to owe their Nihilism less to choice
than to the necessity of making an effective
protest against despotic rule in Russia. Yet
Bakounine, a Russian (1814-76) was the father
of Anarchisn (This remarkable man personi-
fied the genius of discontent. He had an
astonishing influence over men and minds, and,
although intellectually inferior to Karl Marx, he
rivalled and eventually overthrew by sheer force
of personality Marx’s supremacy with the Inter-
national Association of Workers—the great
socialistic organisation which flourished most dis-
tinctively in the third quarter of this century.
But only after Bakounine’s death were anarchist
theories embodied in a formal declaration of doc-
trine- This has two sides : a negative and a posi-
tive. $ .The first says that everything must be
done away with. No more property : war to
capital, to privileges of all kinds, and to
the exploitation of man by man. No more
fatherland : no frontiers, no strife between
people and people. No more State: war to all
authority, elected or not, dynastic or temporary,
monarchs or Parliaments. And to make up for
this sweeping destruction, perfect liberty. The
social revolution is to have no other object than to
create a state of things in which everybody will
have nothing to do but look after himself. From
this result the three axioms of Anarchy :
No more anything.
Do as you -please.
Every thing's everybody's.
It would be hard to find three compactor maxims,
or three appearing more satisfactory to the Have-
Nots, more outrageous to the Haves.
THE GENIUS OF PATRIOTISM.
“Horrible wretch, she devours her own children!”
As long as anarchists confined themselves to
talking about their creed, European Governments
were little alarmed. Even now, as already ex-
plained, the more respectable and perhaps the
more considerable section of anarchists is not pre-
pared to do more than propagate its opinions by
writing and speech. But speech and writing are
all too tardy vehicles of progress for the more
violent section, so from Italy in 1876 came the
declaration that it was time to proceed to propa-
ganda by deed. From then till now, not a year
has passed without several attempts to awaken by
insurrection “the sleeping conscience of the
masses”—whom anarchists take for granted
will be on their side once they understand
what the trouble is about. The culmination of
that policy was reached only this year in the
assassination of President Carnot. That, from
the point of view of the propagandists by deed,
is the best thing Anarchism has yet accom-
plished. Carnot was killed not as a man, but as a
type —the type of that bourgeois class which turns
a deaf ear to the cry of the labourer until it is
startled into mercy, or terrified into justice. From
the point of view of modern society all such actions
must be in the highest degree criminal, and
enlightened philosophy, if it explains them, can-
not but condemn them. It should be the part of
thinkers and statesmen in Australia to see that the
tendencies to crime latent in every community
have not the shadow of justification in the condi-
tions of life and labour here. For, as Lacassngne
says, “Every society has the criminals which it
deserves. ”
The Jap is fastidious. He must have his
hot-water bath daily. He won’t work beside
kanakas. He hankers after indoor employment.
Lastly, his rice must be pure Japan, otherwise he
goes on strike, as he did a few weeks ago on a
certain Northern plantation.
Spagnoletti: “I have been attending a
send off, in Melbourne, of the ‘He’s a Jolly Good
Fellow ’ order. Gentlemen were told to charge
their glasses with a bumper, and did so, but
nobody dared to drink it. Here is a symptom of
the prevalent malaise. The business men are pretty
well all invalids, through the tension and worry.
What has become of the six-bottlers of yore ? ”
One Bengovey, of Melb., is a pathetic
instance of man’s willingness to lay down his life,
if necessary, in Beauty’s cause. Bengovey, ac-
cording to divorce-court evidence, has long been a
devout worshipper at the shrine of Mrs. Johnson
when her husband was off the premises, and his
love never flinched before the awful possibility of
Johnson’s unexpected arrival. If perchance
Johnson caught his gallant rival in a tender
moment he invariably kicked him on a tender
spot, after which he would spit at his pale face
and “rub in” the saliva. He also made a prac-
tice of bashing the intruder’s head against the
wall, as an inducement for him to put up his
hands and fight, but Bengovey preferred to spare
Johnson for the lady’s sake. Evidently she
admired her lover’s reposeful manner, for he con-
tinued to return like the prodigal to the fatted
calf that was ever at his disposal. The final
interview between Bengovey and Mr. Johnson
occurred in a bedroom. Bengovey had his coat
off at the time, and when he saw the husband
coming in to disturb the dark seance he sat down,
refusing all invitations to stand up and take his
usual hiding in the old familiar style. Johnson,
therefore, “gave him the hiding sitting down,
and then kicked him out,” retaining the coat as
spoils of victory. Mrs. Johnson got notice to
quit about the same time. A decree nisi, with
costs against the persevering co-respondent, was
granted last week, so (Bengovey is already in a
position to enjoy Mrs. Johnson’s society without
thinking of the hour when the bridegroom cometh.
Does the emancipated Lothario feel the happier
for that ? The Bulletin has doubts. He misses
the rapture of hearing his goddess enquire from
time to time—“ Tell me, darling, did he hurt you
much ?”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Through scopes of sky and under
The deeps of eartli and sea,
My soul went out in wonder,
To find but mystery —
A homeless stormbird flying
Through dim, dark seas uncrying,
Till spent with fruitless trying,
It came again to me ;
To find its old home dreary
Because all things had changed,
And all old ways were weary
For that its wings had ranged
O’er leagues of sea unsounded,
Through skies by clouds unrounded,
Through fields of space unbounded,
In ways from wings estranged.
But, ere its final turning,
It felt, in frowning skies,
The deathless glory burning-
. In Wisdom’s wond’rous eyes ;
That they who see shall never
Find rest again for ever,
Till time at last shall sever
The grain, from chaff of lies.
Mine eyes go forth to seaward,
In mute expectancy,
To skyward, or to leeward,
To find some hope for me;
The sullen skies are stormy,
And waves and winds before me,
I curse the times that bore me,
And dream of times to be.
I have grown tired of living
A life that no one knows ;
I sing no glad thanksgiving
While men are weighed with woes;
I know the winds are blowing,
I know the tide is flowing,
I know that Truth is growing,
Through all her thousand throes.
I know that earth the mother
Shall be to all men free,
That each will own the other,
In days that yet shall be ;
I hear like maidens singing
In leafy splendours swinging,
The slow years homeward bringing
The fruits of earth and sea.
But now, like sad seas sobbing.
’Gainst bold, black headlands strong,
I hear the world’s woes throbbing
Against the shores of Wrong,
That shake above and under
When Freedom’s tempests thunder—
I hear these things and wonder
How long, 0 God ! how long ?
