WINE
The wine growers story of favoured vintages
Coonawarra Estate
’66 Riesling
The success of the Rhine
Riesling vines planted at
Coonawarra Estate is shown
by this wine. Bottled within
six months of vintage, the ’66
Riesling has retained fully
the fresh, slightly ‘spritzig’
Riesling character.
Coonawarra Estate
’63 Hermitage
The ripening period of 1963
at Coonawarra was
unusually humid, which
seems to have added
subtlety to the wine, giving
it greater delicacy, yet
with a deeply satisfying full
flavour. It may well prove
to be the best Australian
Hermitage ever.
Coonawarra Estate
’62 Cabernet
Following on the 1960
Vintage, (the 1961 Vintage
was a total loss at Coona-
warra Estate) the 1962 is a
bigger wine in which the
oak-maturation and
Cabernet Sauvignon
character form a well
balanced soft symphony of
flavour.
Modbury Estate
’65 Moselle
Riesling grapes vintaged
early in March result in a
light, delicate wine with all
the best characteristics of a
true Moselle. An undertone
of soft fruitiness adds an
intriguing characteristic
which will appeal to those
who prefer a crisp, not too
dry, white wine.
Ovens Valley
’62 Burgundy
A fine, big Northern
Victorian wine grown from
Shiraz, pressed and matured
in oak for three years. Now,
after bottle-ageing, this soft,
smooth Burgundy is being
released from Wynns. It is a
superb example of the big
wines produced in this area.
Modbury Estate
’65 White Burgundy
Semillion grapes, grown on
gently-contoured Northern
slopes, and expert care have
produced this full, rich
White Burgundy. The ap-
pealing fragrance and flavour
of this vintage earns it pride
of place in any cellar.

BATMAN’S
MELBOURNE
Here's, perhaps,
another place for
a future village
YOUR AGED CORRESPONDENT
is rather sentimental about Port
Phillip. It has its charms, the shimmer
of the silver-grey light across its oily
surface in the early dawn, the broad
golden sands of St. Kilda, Mentone,
and Mordialloc. Nor does it suffer
like Sydney Harbor from comparisons.
Come now, this you must have
noticed. Just the other day we were
told that as the waters rose at Lake
Jindabyne by the end of 1968 it would
be eight times the size of Sydney
Harbor.
And already we have been told that
Lake Eucumbene is nine times the size
of Sydney Harbor. The Victorian
Government Tourist Bureau at every
opportunity says Eildon is six times
the size. Even dear old Hume
Reservoir is six times bigger and over
there in the West the Ord River gentle-
men keep pumping out the information
that their new dam will be seven times
larger.
So, you see, we have the Sydney
Harbor scale. Anybody who puts up a
dam anywhere in the country uses it
as a public whipping post. It’s very
unfortunate.
This doesn’t happen with our Port
Phillip, which is a splendid 725 square
miles. But, just quietly, here in Mel-
bourne we have a number of cherished
dreams that go back almost to
antiquity. One is that in the dream-
time we will get a subway, another is
that we will get a large city square
that will be a thing of beauty, and the
next that Westernport Bay will become
a major port.
One has only to go out in the pilot
vessel Wyuna to learn all about Port
Phillip. Your correspondent on his
last visit created a track record by
going below seven times in 30 minutes.
The Rip is half a mile wide and 48
feet at its deepest point. It is a most
unpleasant, disturbed piece of water.
A director of the University of South-
ampton Navigation School, several
years back, described it as the most
dangerous harbor entrance in the
Southern Hemisphere. At the outer
extremity of Point Nepean, just eight
feet below the surface, there is Corsair
Rock.
Since 1835 it has collected more than
50 victims. Indeed a fishing vessel
went down near The Rip only last
week.
Ah, it’s curious the accidents of
history that decide the location of big
cities. John Batman and John Pascoe
Fawkner came to Port Phillip in 1835
looking for suitable grazing land. They
discovered that the areas surrounding
the Yarra had lots of fresh water and
good accommodation for sailing ships.
Yet just on the other side of the
peninsula that leads to Port Nepean
and that awkward Corsair Rock was
Westernport Bay. In 1798 George
Bass called in there for repairs. He
reported back to Sydney here was a
fine body of water, sheltered from the
storms and rough seas so prevalent in
the area. Three years later, in 1801,
Lieutenant James Grant visited there
in the Lady Nelson.
Now if only Bass or Grant had gone
there as permanent settlers the whole
story could have been different. Mel-
bourne might have been on Western-
port Bay. Frankly there are vast
stretches of Westernport that are not
even as enchanting as St. Kilda and
Elwood, but it has a natural, beau-
tiful bay big enough to take the entire
fleet of the Royal Navy (1940 style).
Here’s the rub. Port Phillip is no
good for really large vessels. Only
after very careful dredging is it pos-
sible to take tankers of 70,000 tons.
The first big breakthrough came last
year. BP Australia Ltd. built a $3O
million refinery at Crib Point. The
Victorian Government put in berth-
ing facilities for tankers and now big
tankers are going in there at the rate
of two a week, and the port can take
tankers up to 100,000 tons.
Furthermore there are two tugs
permanently stationed there, the Henry
Bolte, named in honor of our Sir
Henry, and the Murray Porter, named
for the Minister of Public Works. Many
Westernport enthusiasts felt it was a
good omen that the tugs were named
after politicians. Unquestionably now
the port would grow and we would get
an entire Cabinet of tugs, the tug
Arthur Rylah, the tug Lindsay Thomp-
son, the tug John Bloomfield . . . The
“I’ll never know why they didn’t build
Melbourne ’ere —no traffic problems,
no urban overcrowding..."
channel leading up to the refinery jetty
is more than a mile wide and naturally
scoured. It is deep enough without
dredging to take the largest ships
afloat.
Of course, it’s only our superb
loyalty to fine old Port Phillip that
nothing was done 50 years before this.
A Royal Commission in 1928 pointed
out the magnificence of Westernport;
then it wasn’t until 1960 that the local
shires formed the Westernport Devel-
opment Committee. It produced bro-
chures, pamphlets, and one immedi-
ately gathered from members around
Hastings that the only sensible thing to
do would be to abandon the Mel-
bourne site and rebuild the city at
Flinders.
The Committee reserved ten square
miles of land between Hastings and
Cranbourne for future development,
and now it seems a certainty that in the
glorious Victorian future mentioned by
Sir Henry in his election speech
Westernport will be the new industrial
area. This will be the port for the
Bass Strait and natural gas. “The
Age” even claims that it is to be the
site for the greatest industrial develop-
ment in Victoria’s history, and the big
announcements will come any day.
Near Hastings there will be an Esso-
BHP oil refinery, John Lysaght (Aust.)
Ltd. will put in a steel works, Cresco
Fertilisers will put in a fertiliser plant,
there will be great new port facilities,
a freeway via Dandenong, and there’s
even a suggestion of a nuclear reactor
to provide electricity and desalinated
water to augment the water supply.
This last item is rather necessary. Even
George Bass back in 1798 found the
place very light on water.
So far there has been no confir-
mation and no denial on all this vast
activity. The unofficial confirmation
has come in the usual dinkum Aus-
tralian way. Since the end of last year
land prices in the area have risen any-
thing up to 1000 percent, and some
happy farmers have received $4OOO
an acre.
Oh, we could go further. The Vic-
torian Chamber of Manufactures, in a
magnificent compromise, suggests that
Port Phillip and Westernport Bays
should be linked by a canal across the
Mornington Peninsula. Then we would
have a water transport network con-
trolling the area. Melbourne and
Geelong would be 50 miles closer to
the Victorian eastern seaboard. We
could have hydrofoil ferries operating
between Melbourne and Cowes. Phillip
Island could be a commuter suburb.
All this is put forward just to show
you how Melburnians are dreaming at
the moment. Meanwhile there is an
uproar among bayside councils over a
$ll4 million south-eastern sewerage
scheme where purified effluent will be
pumped into Port Phillip Bay two
miles off Carrum. This, no doubt, is
the best reason yet for shifting Mel-
bourne to Westernport. We need more
room for our effluent society.


Look who’s taken over from King Neptune...
Now aluminium rules the deep by force of its strength,
versatility, and resistance to corrosion!
When the R.A.N. wanted twenty new
vessels for patrol work around
Australia’s northern coastline and
Pacific Islands, it had a problem.
What metal to use in the super-
structure? The metal had to be light,
strong, and as near maintenance-free
as possible. Aluminium was the answer.
Besides being light and tough, an aluminium
superstructure gives the vessels a lower
centre of gravity, which means greater
stability. And because of aluminium’s
extraordinary corrosion resistance,
maintenance is practically nil.
Being constructed in Queensland, each vessel
will be 107 ft. long witfr a2O ft. beam,
and will incorporate more than 3.5 tons
of aluminium in the superstructure, funnel
casing, and fittings below deck.

SOMETHING
NEW
WITH GRAHAM KERR
An ethical
recipe for the
tastiest veal
IN THE RUNNING contest with New
South Wales for State honors, Victoria
has lately been cooking up a few
advantages for itself in the gastronomic
line. First came legalisation of the
pheasant farmer, something to delight
even the most offhand gastronome.
Released, too, is the incredibly delicious
Moe Camembert. And now comes an
announcement that Victoria is to pro-
duce genuine milk-fed white veal.
Before tackling the veal issue, a
word about the Moe Camembert. The
other night I dined at a Danish restau-
rant with a well-known Danish couple
and could hardly believe my ears when
my host said enthusiastically that our
Camembert is much better than those
imported from Denmark and France.
I agree, but with one reservation.
Camembert is a fragile cheese which
does not take kindly to transportation
and several times I have been extremely
disappointed with Moe Camembert
bought in Sydney.
The answer is the practice long fol-
lowed by Fortnum and Masons in
London. On Monday I used to pay
15/- a lb. for a perfect French Camem-
bert. On Tuesday the price fell to
12/- and so it went on —as the quality
fell away so did the price. On Friday
the cheese was still good but it was
also in the bargain class. An idea for
our high-class food stores where,
regardless of age, cheese is sold at a
set price though it cannot fail to vary
in quality.
Milk-fed white veal doesn’t present
the same problems because, like pork,
it is meat that freezes well, provided
it is hung for two days about 42deg.
before zero refrigeration.
White veal breeding has been intro-
duced all over the world where there
are plentiful milk supplies and fetches
a good price, but everywhere it arouses
the indignation of animal protection
societies.
This, bluntly, is how the veal is
produced on the Continent. The calf
stays with its mother until she becomes
“dry.” Then it is removed to a
darkened barn and housed in a pen so
small that by the time it is four months
old it will be unable to lie down or
turn around. Its head is tethered to a
pole. The animal develops an iron
deficiency which is allowed to continue
in order to keep the skin light, and it

is fed on skimmed milk to which, be-
cause it is a weak diet, hormones are
added.
This is the pitiful picture of “factory
produced” meat, creatures who live
only until the scales tip in financial
favor of their execution, as the
scientist-farmer seeks to produce a much
sought-after delicacy with minimum
effort at minimum cost. But I wonder
if the moral cost is minimal?
If others share my reaction, I cannot
see them eating veal produced under
the European conditions.
But then we do eat eggs produced on
production-line methods and is this not
similar to the control system of pro-
ducing white veal? The only difference,
it seems to me, is in size of the creatures.
Is compassion relative to cubic
capacity?
In egg batteries, the birds are penned
up, usually in pairs, allowed just enough
room to move, and are fed and watered
automatically. Science has changed
the chicken from the “egg a day back-
yarder” to a multi-production machine
whose feet literally never touch the
deck. Is this cruel?
A country branch of the Society for
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which
recently inspected one of these batteries,
said it was not. It found conditions
warm, clean, and comfortable. Battery
hens have no lice or mites to plague
them, are free of disease and farmyard
fights.
Some city RSPCA members have
found conditions less than ideal but
criticisms of batteries are empty unless
issued by a homemaker who uses eggs
laid only by backyard fowls.
In Japan, the beasts which produce
the famous Kobe beef are penned up
for most of their lives to restrict move-
ment and keep the meat tender. Things
are somewhat better for them, however,
since they are fed beer and oats and
massaged with warmed oil.
This brings me back to the question
of veal. Certainly in production
methods cruelty should be reduced to
a minimum. Bearing this in mind, can
we have our milk-fed veal?
I believe we can, but only under these
conditions: The calf should be penned
to permit ease of movement, including
turning and lying down, at maximum
weight and size. It should be allowed
daily exercise in a relatively grass-free
paddock. The animal’s head should be
untethered and a more satisfactory diet
should be found, one comprising only
natural” food products, yet acceptable
to the animal and practical for the
farmer, to prevent darkening of the
flesh.
In such conditions we would not
have true white veal it would be
slightly tinted but the requirements
of conscience would be met.
Substantially I believe this is what is
to happen in Victoria —so fine. As to
the societies concerned about animal
farming, I believe they should con-
centrate on getting the “best of con-
ditions” sorted out rather than try to
turn back the clock.

You can't get a
man (or girl)
with a pun
BY ROSS CAMPBELL
LIGHT CONVERSATION used to be
in high repute as a catalyst of the rela-
tions between the sexes. The function
was implied by various common
phrases —to murmur sweet nothings, to
chat up, and so on. But there are
signs that this traditional form of com-
munication is going out of fashion.
Young people now are inclined to
regard rhetoric of any kind as tedious
—“raving on,” they call it. We learn
from the cables that an advanced group
of American trend-setters are dispensing
with talk altogether. They are
students of Columbia University, male
and female, and they have formed a
social club in which they never speak
to each other.
This is a far cry from the conven-
tions that prevailed in my youth. As
I recall, we went to a great deal of
trouble to provide verbal entertainment
for the opposite sex. We told funny
stories. We recited limericks, their
degree of impropriety being nicely
adjusted to the tolerance of the audi-
ence. We collected a stock of pre-
fabricated witticisms. Thus when
inviting a girl to dance we would extend
the left arm and say: “Care for poultry?
Take a wing.”
Yet in retrospect I am not sure that
the effort of maintaining this Wildean
flow of drollery was justified by the
results. What little amatory success we
had was probably achieved in spite of
our brilliant conversation rather than
because of it. Always the moment
came when a transition had to be made
from oral levity to the serious business
of romance, and it was by no means
easy. As often as not we bungled the
attempt.
My suspicion that we were on the
wrong tactical track was increased by
reading the biography of the late Prince
Aly Khan, by Leonard Slater. Accord-
ing to Mr. Slater, Aly was a poor con-
versationalist and had a very limited
sense of humor. But when it came to
ingratiating himself with womankind
he was unquestionably, as they say, the
man to beat.
On this subject the testimony of
eminent men of letters, for what it is
worth, is conflicting. Swinburne de-
scribed his noted femme fatale, Dolores,
as having “lips full of lust and of
laughter”—suggesting that she enjoyed
a good limerick with the best of them,
and was nonetheless co-operative for
that. But as Swinburne’s idea of an
evening’s fun was to be beaten up by a
large lady circus rider, his opinions on
feminine psychology must be accepted
with reserve. A more worldly author,
Lawrence Sterne, though himself a wag
of distinction, considered that jokes
were not appropriate to amorous
strategy. Somewhere in “Tristram,
Shandy” he remarks: “There is no
passion so serious as lust.”
Certainly the consensus among male
writers is opposed to any display of
conversational ability by the female.
John Donne said with something like
downright rudeness: “For God’s sake
hold your tongue and let me love.”
Rupert Brooke complained irritably:
“You came and quacked beside me in
the wood.”
It can be argued that even the
serious kind of verbal wooing, whether
spoken or written, has little influence
on the feelings of the person to whom
it is addressed. Love poets, by and
large, do not seem to have done much
good for themselves. Catullus, who
raved on in eloquent style, was dropped
by Lesbia just the same. And going
back to the success story of Aly Khan:
one of his former girlfriends, when
asked to explain his phenomenal record
of conquests, did not attribute any
importance to his word-of-mouth per-
suasiveness. She replied simply: “He
had the time and the money.”
The young persons of today, in dis-
carding the conversational trimmings
previously associated with love, show
the iconoclastic realism that is charac-
teristic of them. Levity, as far as one
can gather, is discouraged in this sphere
of effort. The unsmiling glare of Miss
J. Shrimpton is still—despite the vogue
of the elfin Twiggy—a widely admired
standard of deportment. The students
who have formed the speechless social
club at Columbia are merely carrying
a trend to its logical extreme.
If, as we may surmise, the purposes
of the club are basically erotic, the
members are going about their business
in a practical fashion. No doubt they
dance or sit around while directing at
each other a silent, smouldering gaze
that generates almost unbearable
tension.
And yet —perhaps now and then
some member has a guilty impulse to
say something. There may be a few
still afflicted, as my friends and I were
in youth, with the curse of levity. I
imagine one of them losing self-control
and saying: “Have you heard this?
There was a young lady of Wantage
Of whom the town clerk took
advantage —”
But before he can finish, the club
committeemen have led him to the
door, growling: “Get out, you chatter-
box!”

Finding a good
pitch off the
concert platform
BY DAPHNE GUINNESS
THE ABC TRIED to persuade Julian
Bream to spend his first weekend in
Australia at Brisbane, where he was
expected later for a concert. Not on
your nelly, said Mr. Bream with
cockney directness, not with that
shocking humidity. Think what it
would do to his guitar and lute. All
that expansion and (on return to drier
parts) contraction could do untold
damage.
This, of course, is an occupational
hazard for Mr. Bream travelling as
he does around the world. His lute
was given the death sentence five years
ago, but he is very fond of it and with
careful patching what he calls his
“happy instrument” has survived all
kinds of climatic perils. Still, there
was no point asking for trouble.
So instead of Brisbane he indulged
in what might be described as a week-
end sportif in Sydney, and we can
report that the subtle fingers of Julian
Bream are just as effective clasping
ping-pong and cricket bats as they are
plucking guitar strings. Actually, this
athletic talent runs in the family. His
brother is table-tennis champion of
Surrey, England, and Mr. Bream him-
self, if he hadn’t taken up the guitar,
would have been a professional cricketer.
(He is a very powerful bat and his
admiring audience quickly vacated their
garden wicker chairs for safer viewing
inside the house.) Bus-driver father,
however, kept him at the guitar, and for
this parental encouragement millions
of fans should be grateful.
Jules, as his mates call him, is 32
and possesses a round, shortish physique
which, surprisingly, takes kindly to the
suit of tails he wears while performing.
He has wispy, dark hair which he
fiddles with while talking till it ends
up in a frightful tangled state. He
enjoys his food and drink and thought
it very funny when a five-year-old said,
“You’re the best guitar in the whole
world, and also the best at table.”
In fact, the only thing he pined for
in Sydney was a plate of decent bacon
and eggs. He tried all the big hotels
for a tasty bit of streaky for breakfast,
but couldn’t find it. Mr. Bream’s face
crumpled when we said bacon here
and bacon in England were two dif-
ferent things.
Rashers and critics apart, he found
everything here “very English.” In
London he drives the critics mad, what
with the guitar being a bit non-U
nowadays, by selling out his once-a-
year concert even before the program is
announced. And, talking of programs,
he nearly passed out when he realised
minutes before appearing at the Sydney
Town Hall for his first concert that he
had practised the wrong one. “Gawd,”
he said, “my heart plummeted. But it
was all right once I got going.” As his
rave reviews proved.
Mr. Bream’s annual sell-out is even
more remarkable, and must add to the
gnashing of critics’ teeth, since it takes
place in the Elizabethan Hall, next door
to the Royal Festival Hall, and is des-
cribed by him as a beautiful mistake.
Everything about its appearance is
awful. The outside, the inside, the light-
ing, the dressing-rooms are tatty and
terrible but the acoustics are mar-
vellous. “Imagine,” he said, amazed,
“they spend a fortune at the Festival
Hall getting the acoustics right, testing
each seat for sound, and it’s lousy. Then
they throw this rotten little place to-
gether next door and wham! perfect.”
He hopes the Opera House, to which he
padded down each morning from his
hotel, has good acoustics. Anyway, it
looks smashing from outside.
Normally, Mr. Bream practises five or
six hours a day, but while on tour it is
two or three. Far from it being a won-
derful free recital for the next-door
occupants at the hotel, he thought it
must have driven them potty: unless
they enjoyed scales and arpeggios. This
consideration of people’s feelings was
evident during his concert when he
played some 15th-century music and the
audience clapped too soon. With his
head still down, he raised one fore-
finger and they were silenced. If you’d
looked at them, asked someone, what
would have happened? “It would be
embarrassing.” For you or for them?
“For them. After all, they weren’t to
know this obscure thing hadn’t fin-
ished.”
What is distracting and time-consum-
ing is the number of people who want
to see him. He spent 40 minutes the
other day heckling with an old man
who said he had a new short-cut way
of learning the guitar. Then a young
girl rushed up at Mascot, at 6.30 in the
morning, asking for lessons. He thought
if she was that keen she might have
some talent, heard her, and good-
naturedly gave a lesson. Well, you
know, corrected her here and there.
However, it was to escape from' de-
mands such as these that he once, in
England for the Aldeburgh Festival, re-
fused to stay at a hotel and put up a
tent in a field instead. It was a nice
French one, with three rooms and three
gasburners for cooking. He did all his
entertaining there and the Festival nobs
came down and partook of refreshment
and seemed to enjoy themselves no end.
The reason why he remembered this so
well was the Princess of Hesse, who
looked round and said, “Hmmmmmm,
yes, very nice, Mr. Bream. But what do
you do for pressing?”

Instant tradition
A FEW DAYS AGO structural work
on the Australia Square tower finished
and, it was announced, the “tradi-
tional” tree was set on the roof. We
also noted a tree on the top of a par-
ticularly unattractive building going up
at King’s Cross. This is, of course, not
an Australian tradition at all. It is
done in Europe, and as there are
numbers of European workmen on the
projects it is taken to be something
of a gesture to them, although not,
perhaps, a very attractive or sensible
one.
While we are not prepared to accept
cutting down a tree and leaving it to
die on top of a building as a tradition,
we might, looking at the way our cities
are developing, accept it as a symbol.
The expert
UNTIL a few days ago we have been
prepared to nominate the London
model Twiggy as the non-person of
1967. However, we would now like to
put forward the claims of Miss Sandra
Hilder, who, on the strength of having
slept in an admiral’s bed (not, one
would think, an unusual achievement
in some circles) is accepted as an
oracle on various matters, including
how to run a navy. We are now
awaiting her views on the conduct of
the Vietnam war.
Cheapening words
LIKE SPECTATORS at a tennis-
match, we noted the views of the
French commentators on the British
application to join the Common
Market, then the British commentators
on the French reaction to the British
application, followed by the French
reaction to the British reaction. If
Britain does go in, we hope there will
at least be some rationalisation of
rationalising.
Smelling as sweet
IT’S NOT roses all the way for the
new Geographical Names Board, set up
recently to rationalise placenames in
New South Wales. The board tried
to change the name of Blackfellows
Gully, near Uralla, but the local
shire council said no, it might have
some historical importance, although
heaven knows what. Another shire in
northern New South Wales objected to
a proposal to rename Burying Ground
Creek a tepid Hillgrove Creek.

AS I SEE IT
Not to worry
about the
sea of troubles
BY ALAN REID
PRIME MINISTER Harold Holt and
his Ministers are getting anxious to
see the end of the present Parliamen-
tary session due to wind up on May
19. A session which opened promisingly
for the Government is threatening to
end sourly.
The troubles piling up on the Gov-
ernment’s plate in a rough order of
importance are:
Britain’s proposed entry into the
European Common Market (apparently
on any terms, and certainly on terms
which are going to make it hard sled-
ding for a variety of Australian pro-
ducts for which the United Kingdom
has been the traditional market).
Britain’s withdrawal from Malaysia
and Singapore (with the likelihood of
Australia being called upon to fill at
least part of the enormous vacuum
that such a withdrawal would create in
South-East Asia).
The mounting uncertainty and un-
easiness about the bill for Australia’s
controversial replacement bomber, the
Fill (immortalised in Victorian
Laborite Noel Beaton’s apt description
of its financial qualities as “The Flying
Opera House”).
Victorian Liberal John Jess’ threat
to bring to the Parliament what he
considers the suppressed evidence in
the Voyager inquiry (fortunately, from
the Government’s viewpoint, it appears
to have got Jess on the wrong leg).
Instead of arguing whether the in-
quiry was held on the right issue—
which would possibly make Jess’
material relevant they have
manoeuvred him into arguing whether
his material would be relevant to the
issues into which the Royal Commission
actually inquired.
Twenty-two-year-old South Australian
Liberal Andrew Jones’ declaration that
Parliamentarians are “half drunk half
the time” (this must surely have an
effect on voting in the referendum
which will seek an increase in the
number of Federal Parliamentarians).
The savage rise in postal and tele-
phone costs and a possible public re-
action against the new concept of turn-
ing the Post Office into a profit-making
instrument instead of regarding it, as
in the past, as a public service whose
rates must be kept at the lowest figure
compatible with financial endurance.
While Holt is undoubtedly looking
forward to the haven of the Parliamen-
tary recess, and a valuable breathing
space, I do not see him as unduly
worried.
Offsetting the chill of his developing
troubles, he has the recent Victorian
election result which brought Sir Henry
Bolte and his Liberal team back into
office with a larger majority than ever.
A realist, Holt can read election re-
sults as well as anyone. And one
reading that comes from the Victorian
election result is this: as long as em-
ployment and living standards, both
politically vital factors, and the expan-
sion on which they depend, are main-
tained, elections in Australia are still
basically being decided on ideological
grounds.
Bolte had a lot against him this time.
He was not supported by powerful
groups within the Victorian community
with the same alacrity as he was in
previous elections. The Country Party
allied itself with the Labor Opposition
only and strongly. Those who resented
the fact that he had maintained hang-
ing as a penalty for murder worked
against him, unceasingly, and, on paper
at least, they represented the com-
munity’s opinion makers.
Yet, despite these handicaps he did
better than he had before. If he can-
not be given the credit for the extent
of the victory in his own right, then
the Left-wing Victorian ALP Executive
can claim it in his place.
For it is undoubtedly the Left-wing
nature of the Victorian ALP Executive
which maintains the DLP in Victoria
in a strength which has not waned nor
shown any sign of waning as the Vic-
torian results showed, and which turned
a State Election into an ideological
battle.
As Dr. D. W. Rawson, Senior Fel-
low in Political Science in the Institute
of Advanced Studies at the ANU (and
a Labor sympathiser), said in a lecture
in Canberra last week: “I see no rea-
son to doubt that unless the ALP makes
some attempt to attract its (DLP) sup-
porters —and that means deliberately
and publicly making concessions to
their opinions and policies—the DLP
will still be getting between 12 and 17
percent of the Victorian votes in 1977,
and perhaps in 1987, and the ALP will
not have won a Federal Election in
the meantime.”
The Left-wing ALP Executive in
Victoria as it is constituted at the
moment will not deal with the DLP.
The DLP will not deal with the ALP
in Victoria while it operates under a
Left-wing Executive. So it is dead-
lock.
Holt is a realist. He knows the
Victorian position as well as anyone
in Victoria. He can philosophically
endure the buffets of misfortune, pro-
vided he can secure his flanks on the
employment and living-standards fronts
and while the ALP-DLP relationships
continue in Victoria.
The irony of the whole situation is
that while Federal ALP takeover of the
Victorian ALP Branch could produce
a situation in which there could be
some conciliation between the DLP and
the ALP, ALP Federal intervention is
more likely in N.S.W. than in Vic-
toria.
This is what the Left-wing is work-
ing for. Excuse for their action may
be the campaign being mounted against
Labor’s Senate Leader, Senator Murphy,
whose ALP Senate pre-selection comes
up for renewal shortly.
Very powerful forces within the
N.S.W. ALP are working to have this
pre-selection taken away from him.
Murphy is very popular with the Left
Wing who, using Victoria as their power
base, can usually enforce their will at
the ALP Federal Executive meeting.
The Left Wing is carefully documenting
what they alleged to be irregularities
on the part of the N.S.W. ALP branch
in both the manner and the method
of the anti-Murphy campaign.
At least a section of them want evi-
dence of these alleged irregularities to
be placed before ALP Federal authori-
ties with a demand for ALP Federal
intervention in N.S.W.
If there were Federal intervention
in N.S.W., Victoria would become the
unchallenged authority for all practical
purposes possessing complete control
over the ALP Federal machine.
Its control has been disastrous from
Labor’s electoral viewpoint in Victoria.
Its indirect control over the Federal
ALP has resulted in Labor going into
a decline which (as Dr. Rawson pointed
out in his Canberra lecture) was worse
than any previous one in its history.
Said Rawson: “The last time the ALP
polled as badly in a Federal election
as it did last November was not in
1949 nor 1931 nor 1919 (years of his-
toric Labor routs) but in 1906.”
Holt has a lot going against him.
But he can console himself philosophic-
ally with the thought that his nominal
enemies are seeing to it that he also
has a lot going for him.

A man can erect an
18ft.x9ft. carport in
less than a day
and have it last
a lifetime
with Alcan's G.P 22
Building Sheet.
One ingot of aluminium is much the
same as another. It's what you make
of it that counts. And that's where the
power of ideas comes in.
Take Alcan Building Sheet. We made
it thicker and wider than competitive
sheets so that the job can go up
faster with fewer laps and fastenings.
Tradesmen and handymen reckon
that was a pretty good idea.
Alcan Building Sheet goes through a
cladding process, which is a sort of
alloy lamination that gives the surface
maximum corrosion resistance.
That's not a bad idea either.
Incorporated into the design of the
sheet is a sure weatherproof device
for the side laps which has been
tested against the most adverse
weather conditions. The sheet's dis-
tinctive embossed pattern is featured
on all accessories—right down to the
washers. Maybe that's not a big deal,
but it does make the finished job look
neater and more professional. You can
see Alcan Building Sheet on display
at your builders supplier and hard-
ware store. He'll be only too happy
to give you a copy of the brochure
which explains all about the product.
Build a carport or a patio with Alcan
Building Sheet next week-end !

AUSTRALIA
The wages case: a new
Federal policy emerges
LAST WEEK THE Australian
Government adopted what economists
call a productivity-geared wages
policy, and no one noticed it in among
all the talk of the Brits going into
Europe, and young Jones recanting on
his claim that MPs are boozers and
bludgers.
Until now the Commonwealth has
had no wages policy at all. It has
simply gone along to the Arbitration
Commission each year to tell it to
look at the economy with a view to
the public interest, and be moderate
in its award —advice that is quite mean-
ingless.
At last it has caught up with what
other countries have been doing for a
long time the Europeans since the
’sos, the U.S.A. since Kennedy’s
adoption of “guidelines,” and the
Wilson regime which implemented an
“incomes policy.”
All rest on the contention simple
when stripped of jargon that wages
cannot grow more quickly than the
output of the economy or else there
will be pressure on profit margins and
therefore on prices. And higher prices,
as well as undermining the nation’s
export capacity, erode the value of
the basic wage awarded, and are self-
defeating.
The simple rule therefore is that
average wages must not rise faster than
average production (called produc-
tivity). “Productivity” becomes the
wage guideline.
In its revolutionary submission the
Commonwealth firmly stated for the
first time that wages should be in-
creased according to the capacity-to-
pay, that being determined by the
trend 2.2 percent a year.
Admitting that the statistics are not
good enough to give any significance
to percentage points, it left the clear
conclusion that the Commission should
think in terms of two-percent wage
rises being both non-inflationary and
just.
Part of the Commonwealth’s attempt
to establish productivity as the guide
to wages depends on discrediting the
idea of adjusting wages for prices, and
this the Government did more vigor-
ously than ever.
It described as “quite remarkable,”
the Commission’s suggestion, in the
interim margins judgment last Decem-
ber, that wages and salaries should be
automatically compensated for prices
increases, regardless of the cost to the
community. It asks why wages alone
of all incomes should be given prefer-
ential treatment.
On the basis of the Commonwealth’s
suggested productivity guideline, wage-
earners should get average annual pay
increases of the order of 80c a week
rather than the $2 granted last year.
But the real result should be much
the same since a source of inflationary
pressure would be removed and our
exportable capacity maintained.
Common Market
No alarms
BRITAIN’S DECISION to apply to
join the Common Market was taken
fatalistically in Canberra. Prime
Minister Holt’s rather weak speech on
the subject in Parliament summed up
the low key reaction.
In John McEwen’s Department of
Trade the consensus is that Britain will
get into the Market, and there is not
much hope of negotiating any special
concessions for our products. But, of
course, they will try to get the British to
exert a moderating influence on the
Community’s protectionist policies.
There are people in External Affairs
who think de Gaulle may still be able
to spike the British application, but
most feel that Wilson would not be
making this second attempt without
being prepared to make all necessary
concessions.
A lot of interest attaches to the time
it will take until Britain is operating
fully within the framework of the
Treaty of Rome. The most common
guesses are that it will take at least two
years for the British to be accepted, and
about another two or three years for
transitional arrangements.
This leaves us a period of about
five years in which to make provision
for the industries whose markets will be
affected: fruit, sugar, and dairying
principally.
Trade is not the only affected field.
Minister for Trade John McEwen
There may also be wide-ranging finan-
cial implications. Treasury is already
following a policy of shifting slowly
out of sterling into other currencies as
stores of foreign exchange and this may
be accelerated. There are some sug-
gestions that entry into the EEC may
be accompanied by a devaluation of
sterling and we would stand to lose a
great deal by this should we still have
large sterling holdings.
The EEC provides for free capital
movements between member countries,,
which implies that any restrictions on
outflow—such as those at present
applied by Britain to non-sterling coun-
tries—would be concentrated on out-
siders. So in finance as in trade we
would be turned from an insider to an
outsider.
But there is a great reluctance here
to sound great alarms as Mr. McEwen
did in 1962. Mr. Bury, sa ck e d
then for scepticism about scaremonger-
ing, is now right in the mainstream of
Government thinking.
The Fill
Blind deal
NO GOVERNMENT officials were to
be seen at Fairbairn Airport on Friday
when Henry J. Kuss boarded an Ansett
Fokker for Sydney but one could
be forgiven for imagining sighs of
relief echoing through the defence com-


Air Minister Howson in the Fill
cockpit
plex at Russell Hill and down the hal-
lowed halls of Parliament House.
For as far as the Australian Govern-
men was concerned, Henry Kuss
the soft-spoken congenial American
super-arms-salesman (the title super-
sedes his official status of Deputy
Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Depart-
ment of Defence) was the most embar-
rassing Yank to visit Canberra in
recent months.
“The Opera House Mouth,” as one
Australian official later sarcastically dis-
missed Henry Kuss, in his 48 hours
in Canberra said more and revealed
more about the cost of the controversial
Fill swing wing bomber (Australia has
24 on order for an overall cost of
an estimated $2OO million) than Aus-
tralian Government Ministers or
Defence officials have done since the
initial order was placed in 1963
just by coincidence a little before the
Federal election of that year.
Mr. Kuss aptly described as a
benign Billy Bunter did just as
much damage as the machinations of
that infamous comic book character to
the carefully created cloud of confusion
surrounding Australia’s commitment to
America’s Fill project.
By design of accident, he succeeded
in showing that the Government Minis-
ters concerned had been, to say the
least, a little careless in their state-
ments about the Fill.
Among other things they had not
bothered to clarify confusion surround-
ing costs either of the aircraft, its
spares, modifications, maintenance
equipment and, in fact, in many
instances had fostered the impression
the Australian Government had firm
prices on some items.
Within five minutes of his arrival
Henry Kuss destroyed many myths, and
Australia learnt more about the Fill
project than revealed by Government
sources over three years.
The final analysis revealed that Aus-
tralia, as far as costs were concerned,
had gone into the Fill deal blind.
Today, it does not have a firm price
(even the oft spouted “firm” price of
$5.31 million for the basic aircraft is
subject to an escalation clause on
labor and materials) on a single nut or
bolt relating to the Fill order.
It has been a rough week for Aus-
tralia’s Minister for Air Mr. Howson
(who has inherited the headache of
the Fill project) and the Minister for
Defence (Mr. Fairhall). Mr. Howson in
particular found it hard going trying
to defend the indefensible and wilted
under the Opposition barrage laid down
on Wednesday.
It is to be hoped the lesson of the
visit of Henry J. Kuss has been well
noted. It is now reasonable to assume
that in future Australia can anticipate
more frankness and accuracy concern-
ing the major Defence purchases.
External Affairs
The “morale crisis"
COMMENTATORS ARE always ex-
pected to have something to say and
to sound as if they are saying some-
thing. And when they are stuck for a
subject they revive an old one, dressing
it up a little in new verbal clothes. And
when it suits them those greatest of all
plagiarists, the politicians, latch on to
do their bit to sensationalise the issue.
Such is the context in which a
“morale crisis” has built up in the
Department of External Affairs. Mr.
Whitlam has spoken of it in speech
after speech laying it at the feet of
the Minister, Mr. Hasluck.
Our Canberra bureau reports that
repeated talk of poor morale has led
E.A. officers to adopt a new style of
greeting, “How’s morale?”
“Crisis” is a ridiculous word to apply
to the situation since it suggests some
drastic deterioration and an impending
breakdown. There is dissatisfaction,
however. The Minister is regarded as
Head of the Department of External Affairs, Sir James Plimsoll (left) and Minister
Hasluck (right).
rigid and remote. Both his predecessors,
Casey and Barwick, were very
approachable, characters, who often
worked in the Department building and
saw a good deal of middle level as well
as senior officers. They also gave the
impression of being influencable, which
Mr. Hasluck does not.
The administration of the Depart-
ment is said to be inadequate, and some
strange things have happened with staff
promotions recently. Mr. Holt’s in-
terest in foreign policy and the free-
wheeling style give rise to grouches, too.
But this all has to be seen in propor-
tion. Aggrieved individuals can be
found in most organisations, and
diplomats are particularly adept at
articulating their complaints.
Parliament
Jones' apology
“MORE PEOPLE HAVE talked their
way out of here than ever talked their
way in,” is a homily the late Ben Chif-
ley was fond of using about Parliament.
Nobody had more reason to remem-
ber this last week than 22-year-old
Andrew Jones, the garrulous young
Liberal MHR for Adelaide, whose now-
famous speech about Parliament, apart
from being largely untrue, was a
political error of the first order.
His claims about politicians being
“half drunk half the time,” while others
slept in the chamber, are not guaran-
teed to help the chances of the May 27
referendum, which seeks to increase the
number of MHRs.
After being carpeted before the Gov-
ernment Whip, Mr. Dudley Erwin,
Jones made a short but emotional per-
sonal explanation to the House in which
he used the word apology three times
and admitted that he had been “foolish
and indiscreet.”


Andrew Jones
Jones was obviously upset with the
joshing Labor MPs gave him while he
apologised, and sat through the rest
of question time with his hand over his
face.
The question remained will Jones
learn by his mistake? An allied ques-
tion is whether or not the Jones affair
will curb the tendency of the Young
Liberals to jump over the slip-rails.
Andrew Jones’ speech was delivered
to 25 members of an Adelaide Liberal
Dining Group composed of senior Young
Liberals (whose ages can run as high
as 35-40 years). It happened only a
month or so after N.S.W. Young Liber-
als began a period of “intelligent self-
criticism” of their Party. A few weeks
later, the Tasmanian Liberal Party re-
fused to print the University Liberal
Club’s magazine with a proposed editor-
ial criticising the State leader.
And last week the Queensland Young
Liberals stirred up an issue their party
is not keen to support legalised
abortion after rape and kept it on
the agenda paper despite an appeal from
their retiring State president. This is
the ground-swell of Young Liberals’
determination to speak out, which the
Party elders will either have to agree
is a good thing, or try to curb.
The A.C.T.
Progress report
AFFABLE DOUG ANTHONY who
rides a mini-wheeled bicycle from his
modern house in a new suburb to
Parliament each sunny day, said
recently that he supposed he was Mayor
of Canberra. He has the title of Minis-
ter for the Interior which doesn’t give
him anything like the unlimited national
powers the title conjures up in Euro-
pean minds. But he has unlimited
power to order the municipal affairs
of the City of Canberra. There is
an Advisory Council elected by the
people of the national capital but it
only gives advice. The Minister and the
Department of the Interior make the
decisions.
Last week the Department issued a
“progress report” on “investigations
into self-government for the Australian
Capital Territory.” Its introductory
summary assures readers it “makes no
recommendations and reaches no firm
conclusions as to appropriate forms of
government; it does, however, indicate
that any self-government which may
evolve will not come immediately.”
The report which the Department
has “kept as short as practicable” pro-
ceeds through 30 pages of beautiful,
involuted departmental prose, a classic
to be treasured by teachers of English
expression. It comes up at one point
with the notable conclusion that: “Re-
search indicates that the concept under-
lying the construction of the city of
Canberra was that it should be a city
of such design and standards that it
would reflect credit on the nation.”
Right at the end it declares: “Now
that Canberra, the seat of government,
is fast becoming recognised by the
people of Australia as their national
capital, it would indeed be a tragedy
if it should have its recently acquired
image tarnished by any form of ad-
ministration which did not satisfy the
criteria pointed up in this report.”
Canberrans impatient for further
progress are assured that more such in-
vestigations are to be made, but “it
is difficult to estimate accurately how
long the investigations will take with
the existing limited resources, which
are often stretched to breaking point
with the pressure of work generated by
the community and its spokesmen.”
And then there’s the punchline:
“Should a larger and more effective
team organisation be set up to assist
the investigation, the time-scale would
naturally be reduced.”
It goes on to speak worriedly of
young people “growing up in the Aus-
tralian Capital Territory in a climate
which is conditioning them to the be-
lief that all administration is auto-
matically incompetent —and fair game.”

Stalemate
MELBOURNE WAS MUNCHING
away stolidly last Sunday, still wonder-
ing whether September and spring
would bring fresh and legal weekend
bread.
Everything depended on the Liberal
Party holding the Legislative Council
province of Bendigo. The Liberal
Party’s chances in turn depended on
DLP and, especially, Country Party
preferences. The allocation of Country
Party preferences depended to some
extent on which side of the double-
headed how-to-vote card was uppermost
when handed out. Thus mighty con-
tests are decided by trivial things.
The Victorian Government has tried
four times to pass legislation in favor
of Sunday baking and each time the
Bill has passed easily through the Legis-
lative Assembly and been narrowly de-
feated by the ALP and the Country
Party; and, on the most recent occasion,
by an Independent, in the Upper
House.
Sir Henry Bolte has promised to
have another try in the September
session of Parliament with a Bill allow-
ing baking between midnight and 7.30
a.m. and deliveries to shops between
6 a.m. and noon.
The situation is not, however, as stale
as it may appear from outside Mel-
bourne and metropolitan boundaries.
Fresh bread is available to anyone who
wants to take a short drive for it. Five
bakeries south of the Yarra bake bread
illegally on Sunday mornings. Another
six or seven cater for the north-of-
Yarra trade. All are Continental
bakeries and some estimates of their
Sunday bake are as high as 100,000
loaves.
Meat industry
The paradox
WHAT IS AT PRESENT meat for
Australian housewives the unusual
cheapness of the weekend joint is
proving poison for the nation’s abat-
toirs, many of which are closing down
or shutting off capacity because of a
shortage of stock to slaughter. This is
a paradox. Usually when stock are short
meat prices tend to rocket. The opposite
is happening now because of an un-
usually complex situation facing the
Australian meat industry, particularly
in exports.
What happens in world meat markets
has a direct bearing on Australian
domestic meat prices. Meat, like wool,
is one of the two main Australian com-
modities marketed without subsidy and
the Australian price reflects the world

i
Most dictating machines don't reproduce
music too well because they have 1 speed
only, for words.
The National RQISBS has a 1% i.p.s.
speed for dictation, plus a faster 3 3 4 speed
for finer musical effects.
And when headphones aren’t being used,
sound pours forth from a large 6" cabinet
speaker, not a tiny one in the mike. The
National plays longer, too. Its “auto-
reverse" gives 3 hours’ playing time, so it’s
ideal for meetings or long play classics
sessions at home. And when you’re dictat-
ing, you can switch to “auto-voice” to
capture your words and not your pauses.
So why lavish more on a 1-speed dictating
machine? $189.95 buys you a National 2-
speed, 9 transistor RQISBS tape recorder,
that does much more.

price, allowing for shipping costs to
the main markets, the U.S., Britain,
Europe, and Japan. At present world
meat markets are flat and Australian
exports are likely to remain fairly
static for at least the rest of this
year. This, mainly, is what is holding
down prices in the butchers’ shops.
It does not happen often but at
present meat suppliers cannot unload
meat overseas if they push the local
price too high and create buyer resis-
tance, especially when chicken is a
ready alternative, cheap in Australia
now due to oversupply.
Japan does not seem anxious to in-
crease the quota for Australian beef at
the moment despite strong entreaties
by the Australian Meat Board. The
quota is being used by the Japanese as
a bargaining point in overall Japan-
Australia trading arrangements.
Britain, still one of our main
markets, has financial difficulties, and
increased home production has restricted
imports of Australian mutton and beef,
and in the U.S. trade is currently
“up and down like a yo yo.”
The irony, especially for local abat-
toirs, is that cattle have rarely been
as dear to buy in this country. Calves
(aged 7 to 10 months) are now bring-
ing $lOO on the hoof and at this price
nobody in the trade can make much
money out of them unless overseas in-
terest revives. On the hoof prices are
roughly 20 percent higher than at this
time last year but retail prices haven’t
risen by nearly as much.
Why are cattle so dear when the over-
seas market is depressed? Normally the
reverse would apply. The short answer
lies in the need to restock the drought.
It is a good time to sell cattle if
you have them and do not need replace-
ments. But the meat companies, ex-
porters, and processors, are in a bad
way. Some of them are expecting this
to be their worst year ever. Many of
the smaller processors have closed down
and laid off staff.
Trade in mutton and lamb is equally
depressing. Despite the drought there
is oversupply and no sign of large
overseas purchases. An order to supply
the American forces in Vietnam has not
been repeated.
Major General Kosasih (see right)
New Guinea
Refugees
MALAY TRADERS FIRST set up
posts on New Guinea’s wild, western
coasts back in the fourteenth century,
some four hundred years before the
Union Jack was raised at Port Moresby.
Like the Dutch, Germans, British and
Australians after them, the Malays dis-
covered that New Guinea’s major re-
source was the New Guinean himself—
as a slave. No love has been lost be-
tween Melanesians and Indonesians
since that first contact, but many Aus-
tralians still believe the attractions of
a brown-skinned culture must eventu-
ally triumph over our own uneasy at-
tempts at equality.
This theory may yet prove itself, but
events of the past few weeks have given
it a distinct setback. In armed clashes
between discontented West Irianese and
Indonesian soldiers, a number of people
were killed and wounded. Estimates of
the dead vary from Ambassador Kosa-
sih’s “not more than four or five” to
two thousand.
What is certain is that the occupying
Indonesians have stripped West Irian
of all “luxury” consumer goods and
durables, that the West Irianese have
found life a good deal harder than
under the Dutch, and that disaffection
is making many view life across the
border with favor. The consequently in-
creased flow of “refugees” poses prob-
lems not only for Port Moresby but
for Canberra. To date the Administra-
tion has followed a policy of sending
back all those who could be persuaded
to return. If they convinced Australian
officials that they were genuine politi-
cal refugees, they were allowed to stay,
but forbidden to engage in political
activity and given the minimum of pub-
licity.
Now a touchy but friendly Indonesia
will be affronted by a single false step
and Canberra is playing the game
poker-faced. It accepted a rebuke on
having allowed refugees to stay on our
side of the border from one Indonesian
official, and a plea for economic aid
from another, with the same equanimity.
Later, Indonesia’s Ambassador to Aus-
tralia, Major-General R. A. Kosasih,
suggested liaison offices between West
Irian and Papua-New Guinea. Our
office in Sukarnapura was closed down
in 1963, after the Indonesian take-over,
but the current proposal was accepted
by Minister for Territories, Mr. Barnes,
without demure. When newsmen tracked
him to his home in Warwick, Queens-
land, he disingenuously claimed that
cholera epidemics and economic prob-
lems had caused previous increases in
the number of refugees. General Kosa-
sih was closer to the truth with his
comment: “In Papua-New Guinea you
can buy ice-cream and beer in every
village, but not on the Indonesian side.”

Abbott Laboratories Pty. Ltd. is not a name you’ll see in headlines.
Their business is production of quality pharmaceutical products ... a less spectacular world of
ethics and responsibilities. But it’s still a business, and making money is important to them.
A check of their total distribution costs showed that sending their goods abroad by Qantas
put them way ahead at the end of the year. Although Air Freight costs them $2OO a ton more
than sea freight, they slash other distribution costs by $3OO a ton ... a saving of $lOO a ton!
These are direct costs: of course, they’re also gaining on improved company image,
improved customer service and hence profits on additional sales.
Check your total distribution costs.

COMMENT
Common Market: Australia’s lost five years
AUSTRALIANS ARE suffering from
two illusions about Britain’s possible
entry into the Common Market. One
is that somehow the whole process
would be almost completely painless.
The other is that we have already
made good use of the five years granted
since Britain’s last application failed.
The fact is that, over the past five
years, the reliance of the most vulner-
able industries on Britain has increased.
Our overall exports have diversified,
but sales of butter, fruit, and sugar now
depend desperately on Britain in a way
which means that, if British sales are
lost, as things stand now these industries
would suffer heavy casualties and some
of the foodstuff producers concerned
would probably have to go out of their
present business. At the same time,
while not threatened so drastically, the
wheat and meat industries would have
to find new markets more quickly than
they could probably manage.
After all the great alarums sounded
off five years ago, the Government has
done nothing to prepare the foodstuff-
producing industries for the possibility
of Britain trying again. We have simply
relied on our luck. Our exports have
diversified because we are finding new
things to export. But the dependence,
or partial dependence, of the foodstuff
industries on the British market has
continued. There is continuing chatter
about the need to rationalise the dairy
industry, but there is no coherent
policy for this purpose. This industry
is left in a situation in which its
largest export market may simply col-
lapse. Already more butter is being
produced than can be exported, yet
there are no incentives for dairy farmers
to get out of dairying.
So far as the sugar industry is con-
cerned, the Government must take the
main responsibility for the mess the
industry is now in. It should have
been obvious enough that the boom of
1963 and 1964—based on Fidel Castro’s
disruption of production in Cuba
would be short lived and that such
high prices as existed would then be
undercut by expanded acreages else-
where in the world or by resumption
of Cuban production. Yet, with the
optimism of a drunken go-getter, the
Government gave the go-ahead for a
big expansion in acreage. Naturally,
there were staggering losses for the in-
dustry and for the taxpayer when the
completely predictable price fall came.
Now there is talk of burdening the
Australian consumer with still higher
prices for sugar to pay for some of the
costs of dumping sugar overseas. British
entry into the Common Market would
be certain to terminate our sugar agree-
ment. Bang goes a third of our over-
seas sugar market.
If Britain goes fully into the Com-
mon Market, it would still take until
about 1971 or 1972. We have the
best part of five years to prepare our-
selves. But we should start planning
now. We should stop wondering
whether Britain will make it and work
on the assumption that she will. A
real effort to gain new markets for
sensitive products seems essential, along
with schemes to turn to better use land
which now produces foodstuffs we could
not export. Government spokesmen
do not state their pessimism openly.
They will not say that they have no
hope of preserving any of our protected
markets in Britain because that would
undermine any chances—however re-
mote —in succeeding. But, in fact,
they have few hopes.


MC EWEN
THE TARIFF
CRISIS
John McEwen. .. tariff worries.
TARIFF POLICY is worrying John
McEwen as almost nothing has worried
him in his long and distinguished poli-
tical career. It has strained the coali-
tion of the Government parties more
acutely than at any time outside pre-
election periods; for the first time in
the memory of most it has produced the
beginnings of a rebellion inside the
Country Party and an incipient insurg-
ency against its leadership, actively
encouraged and assisted from within the
Liberal Party. The Prime Minister has
been privately criticised by Liberal
Ministers as “letting Jack McEwen get
away with murder.”
On the Opposition side there have
also been strains. In the ALP they
have not been of the old left-right
variety, but a battle of the new-
sophisticates against the oldies from the
university of hard knocks. For the
oldies it has always been an article
of faith that anyone who so much as
questioned tariff protection was un-
patriotic and anti-working class. On
the side of the new-sophisticates, Mr.
Whitlam, set into motion mainly by his
research officer John Menadue, sup-
ported by Queenslanders Dr. Rex Pat-
terson and Mr. Bill Hayden, got his
Caucus to agree to a new ALP policy
on protection, in March. Dr. Cairns has
skilfully articulated it in the new
Parliament and has been well backed
up by other younger Labor members.
Behind the scenes the DLP is also re-
examining its tariff policy. In Mel-
bourne Mr. Santamaria is enlisting the
assistance of economist Colin Clark to
help him form new thoughts.
Tariff policy matters to all of us. It
decides what prices will be. It can
decide which industries live and which
die. It is the main means by which
the Government shapes the growth of
the economy. By governing the scale,
nature, and direction of our trade rela-
tions with other countries it has a
major impact on foreign policy.
Protection has for many years been
one of the sacred cows of Australian
politics. It was once an issue that
divided the nation but, during the
century, it became more and more
unquestionable. This began in the
19205, when the newly formed Tariff
Board floundered into increasing tariffs
by as much as 50 percent. The process
was greatly strengthened by the Depres-
sion, when tariffs excluded almost all
imports that competed with the local
industries. During and after World
War II direct import licensing saved us
from competition. There was a break
for freedom in 1960, when Harold
Holt’s Treasury defeated John Mc-
Ewen’s Trade Department and dis-
banded the licensing bureaucracy in
Melbourne. But since then McEwen
and his department have fought back,
using the Tariff Board more lavishly
than it has ever been used before.
Now the revolt is becoming vocal.
It began with the arduous and detailed
criticisms in Parliament over the years
by Mr. Bert Kelly (until his appoint-
ment to the Works portfolio, a Liberal
Tariff Board chairman, G. A. Rattigan.
E. J. L. Tucker, Board member.


By PETER SAMUEL
backbencher). A lecture by former
Tariff Board chairman Sir Leslie Mel-
ville helped. Perceptive reporting by
Mr. Alan Wood in “The Financial
Review” and what Mr. McEwen has
described as the “scandalous scribbling”
of Mr. Maxwell Newton in his odd
assortment of outlets have stirred the
pot. The private discourses of the
Treasurer, Mr. McMahon, lobbying by
the Woolgrowers and Graziers’ Council,
the Vernon Report and its surrounding
details, and, finally, and most impor-
tant, a growing sophistication within
the Tariff Board itself have ail added
to the controversy.
But where things may boil over is
within the Coalition parties, where Mr.
McEwen, given a completely free go
by Cabinet, has radically increased
tariffs in a policy of “all-round protec-
tion” that amounts to a new version
of the old system of import licensing.
Mr. McEwen is a superb political
animal and it is political considerations
that have driven him on to a crisis that
may darken the end of his political
career. Mr. McEwen wanted to
broaden the base of his Country Party.
The pastoral and agricultural interests
which formed its traditional support
were too narrow a base in a country
which drew less and less of its income
from the land. Mr. McEwen recognised
several years ago that immigrants and
young Australians entering the work-
force would go almost without excep-
tion into the manufacturing and service
industries. He also sensed a weakness
in the Liberal Party. This Party has
always been stronger in its connections
with financial and commercial interests
than with manufacturers. The revolt
of the manufacturers in 1960-61 against
Sir Robert Menzies made a big im-
pression on Mr. McEwen. Since then
he has been all out to cultivate them.
Like any other bold political man,
Mr. McEwen’s manoeuvre has big
dangers. The Liberals have not yet
fully woken up to what is being created
inside the sombre stone “Admin, build-
ing” by the shores of Lake Burley
Griffin. But they will. And when Mr.
McEwen goes, very few Liberals will
be content to see such a powerful
instrument of policy in the hands of a
young man from the Country Party.
It is known that Mr. McEwen is
grooming Mr. lan Sinclair as his suc-
cessor. But it is hard to see that the
Liberals will accept him.
It is within the flanks of his own
party that the McEwen policy faces
its greatest danger. The present session
of Parliament has seen open revolt in
Country Party ranks against Mr.
McEwen’s tariff policies. Senator Bull,
of N.S.W., said: “The Government must
give urgent attention to its protec-
tionist policy and insist that protection
is only given to those industries that
are regarded as economic and efficient
and are low-cost producers.” He
referred to remarks by resigned Tariff
Board chairman Sir Leslie Melville as
“words of wisdom which we dare not
ignore.” West Australian Senator Sim
spoke of the “very substantial body of
opinion in Australia which is expressing
disenchantment with our present
policy” and stated his position: “What
I question and will continue to ques-
tion is the high level of protection that
is being so freely granted to substantial
sections of Australian industry. I
believe it is having an adverse effect
on the cost structure of Australia. It
is also having an effect on the efficiency
of Australian industry . . . Misdirected
investment should not be protected.”
Two of the nation’s most powerful rural
interests groups—the Australian Wool-
growers and Graziers’ Council and the
Australian Wheatgrowers’ Federation—
have both recently released long de-
tailed criticisms of Mr. McEwen’s tariff
policies.
Mr. McEwen himself is acutely aware
of his danger. In rhetoric he tries to
have it both ways. To manufacturers
he talks the language of protection, to
primary producers he still talks of the
“fundamental problem of rising rural
costs” and admits that industrial
growth, based on high tariffs, contri-
buted to this. His eminence within his
party still holds his policies up. But
when he is replaced by younger men,
they may collapse beneath the burden
he has bequeathed them.
One of Mr. McEwen’s strongest lines
of attack is also one of his politically
weakest positions. This has been the
use of the Department of Trade as a
means of acquiring deep involvement
with businessmen. The growth of this
organisation threatens the interests and
cuts across the philosophies of pro-
minent members of the Liberal Party
and the Treasury Department. Mr.
McEwen set about building up the
Secondary Industry Division of the
Department of Trade two years ago,
when he had his title changed from
Minister of Trade to Minister of Trade
and Industry. Through the monthly
meetings of the Manufacturing Industry
Advisory Council he and his leading
officials had developed a sophisticated
communications system with manufac-
turers. Then, in January last year, he
created an Office of Secondary Industry,
which brought together the tariff policy
and Secondary Industry Division of his
department.
According to its head, Mr. Bill Cal-
laghan, the Office “should be regarded
by secondary industry as its own de-
partmental channel to Government.” It
will not confine itself to the field
administered by the Department of
Trade and Industry, for, to quote Mr.
S. J. Cossar, Board member .
J. R. Murray, Board member.
R. Boyer, Board member.


Callaghan again: “If the Office is to
do a proper job then it must, where
necessary, be concerned about any
Government policy affecting secondary-
industry. 1 suggest that secondary-
industry where necessary should seek
to so concern it (the Office).” Liberals
express the view that this whole
arrangement is a very il-Liberal one,
that it is getting individual businessmen
with vast interests at stake far too close
to public servants, and that it offers
great scope for all variety of smelly
deals. It represents a degree of involve-
ment by Government in private enter-
prise which offends their philosophical
sensibilities. Already it has been vigor-
ously attacked as a “National Planning
and Handout Headquarters,” and
similar attacks are likely to intensify as
its operations grow.
In its defence it is worth stressing the
positive potentialities of an energetic,
committed organisation like this. A
great deal of the recent economic
dynamism of countries like France,
Japan, and Italy has been the product
of quite intense co-operation betw-een
industry and freewheeling Government
departments of this sort. The British
Labor Government’s attempt to mod-
ernise industry relies on a set of similar
institutions, especially the Economic
Development Councils or “little
Neddies” as they are so cornily called.
Already Mr. Callaghan's Office is
active on “inter-firm comparisons” of
industries. This form of investigation,
new to Australia, aims to identify for
firms the ways in which they may be
able to improve their operation and so
raise the overall efficiency of the
industry. Twelve industry studies are
under way and another 15 are in a
preliminary stage. The Office will also
be making studies of problems of
industry location (which, of course,
relates to decentralisation), infrastruc-
ture requirements, import demands and
generally try to identify obstacles to
growth. It might eventually go into
the business of doing feasibility studies
in an attempt, to help local private
enterprise keep foreign capital out. It
has positive potentials.
But, so far at least, the most impor-
tant function of the Office is to make
tariff policy. It incorporates within it
all the old tariff and import sections of
the Department of Trade. It processes
requests for tariffs, decides whether and
w hen to refer them to the Tariff Board
and then, when, the Board has reported,
it advises he Minister as to the action
the Government should take. Mr. Cal-
laghan envisages a deepening of these
functions. Close collaboration with the
Office “could greatly assist industry in
putting a case to the Tariff Board. It
could far better fit it to identify the
impact and measure of import competi-
tion. Even at the other end—that is
after a Tariff Board inquiry—l again
suggest that there could be room for
this sort of operation and there could
be gains for industry . . ."
It is on the operations of the Tariff
Board that most of the open controversy
centres. Here the hurrah-slogan is the
“independence of the Tariff Board." In
considering this it should be stated at
once that the Board is only an advisory
body. It is given the job of conduct-
ing an inquiry and making a recom-
mendation. It is the job of the Office
of Secondary Industry to advise the
Minister. Finally it is Cabinet's respon-
sibility to decide what should be done.
The Board cannot make policy. But
in weighing the often conflicting
interests of manufacturers and their
customers it can appear to be honest
in a way in which anonymous officials
never can. Composed of men without
personal or political interests and con-
ducting its hearings in public, it can
rise above suggestions of undercover
transactions—not only by personal
bribery, but by contributions to party-
funds. To say this is not to suggest
that more private transactions would be
corrupt, but that they cannot be made
to appear to be incorrupt. It is to this
extent that its independence is
important.
Spectacular charges have been made
about the ways in which the Department
of Trade influences the Tariff Board
and ignores its recommendations. Some
of the most striking are difficult to
substantiate, such as the colorful claim
that “some terrible things have hap-
pened which have left their mark on
individual members.” But it is known
that the chairman of the Board, Mr. G.
Rattigan, and other members of the
Board are disturbed by the present
situation and that they have arranged a
meeting with Mr. McEwen when he
returns from the trade talks in Geneva.
The normally cheery Mr. Rattigan has
been silent, though he will make a
major speech expressing his views in
Perth on May 24. He did say to me
that he was “concerned and determined
about maintaining the independence of
the Board.”
Mr. McEwen’s own statement that
he has given the Board “the ultimate
in independence” is innocent to the
point of stupidity. For one thing, Mr.
McEwen has said and often repeated
that the Board “must keep within sight
the objectives of Government policy."
For another, increasingly policy is
written into the terms of reference.
For instance, in the huge chemicals
inquiry the Board was instructed in a
way which suggested that,-beyond ques-
tions, of efficiency, existing employment
and investment were to be protected.
It is also significant that the Tariff
Board secretariat is staffed not by the
Board but by the Department of Trade
and Industry, so that the extent to
which the Board can run its own
research and inquiry is limited.
What may be even more important,
by inaccurate public criticisms of the
Board's operations Mr. McEwen fur-
ther undermines its prestige and there-
fore the force of any act of inde-
pendence it may make. Mr. Rattigan
denies Mr. McEwen's charge that the
Board has been getting slower in its
work. “You cannot simply total up the
number of industries we have dealt
with and come up with a meaningful
result. The clothes-peg industry is
hardly the same as the industrial chemi-
cals and synthetic resins industry.” In
fact, the Board's procedures are now
run on a far more systematic and rapid
basis than ever before. A great deal
of basic work is done by staff befoie
hearings begin.
The proposal to supplement the
Board of seven permanent members
from a panel of part-timers is the most
recent and determined assault on its
independence. As explained to me by
Mr. Callaghan, the idea is to choose a

Office of Secondary Industry.
panel of leading men from the four
areas of public life which have an
interest in tariff policy—manufacturing,
commerce, farming, and public service.
Each of these four groups should be
‘‘represented” on a panel of the Board
hearing any particular case. But this
is impossible. With only seven full-time
members there is often a need for two
or three cases to be heard simul-
taneously. The part-timers would be
introduced to bring any panel up to
four and to give it a “balanced" com-
position. This is a complete abandon-
ment of the original concept of develop-
ing a Board of independent men, secure
in their position and therefore having
a degree of immunity from influence,
and choosing them for their “experi-
ence" in various areas of public life.
It would make it possible for the
Board to be stacked by the Depart-
ment to give the advice it found most
convenient to be given. And, as Mr.
Rattigan says, it would not speed up
the work of the Board: “My experi-
ence is that every Board member has
a mind of his own and wants the

opportunity to express it. The more
Board members there are the longer
the discussions will go on and the
slower will be the report.”
On the other side of the fence, it
should be recognised that there is a
lot that is wrong with the Tariff Board.
At least until the present dispute the
Board has been lamentably amateurish
and unskilful. Its annual reports con-
tained such bromides as that “The
Board found that most industries sur-
veyed were efficient and was particu-
larly impressed by the efficiency of
others.” Its industry reports have been
uninformative and ill-argued, failing to
provide quite simple but vital informa-
tion, and rarely making clear the basis
for its judgments. Picking the “Plastic
Corrugated Sheets” report out of my
heap of little red-covered booklets, I
find that Vinlon Pty., of Brisbane,
applied for a tariff rate of 7c per square
foot per mm. thickness and, turning
to the end, I find the Board recom-
mended duty of 14c per pound weight.
By devious calculations I can work out
that this represents a duty of 130 per-
cent, but nowhere is there any informa-
tion for finding out what proportional
rate the good Vinlon company asked
for, so there is no way short of going
and wasting the Tariff Board’s time of
discovering how the recommended duty
relates to the requested duty. As the
Brigden Report said, back in 1929,
members of the Board should have
a minimum of economic or accounting
expertise. Only two of the seven present
members would seem to have this.
But the Board is certainly making
an effort now to increase its credibility.
Its reports have shown signs of greater
thought and at last there is thinking
about the general principles it should
apply. In the past it tended in a quite
simple-minded way to list the cost dis-
abilities of local industry suffered in
relation to competing foreign industries
and then make a stab at a duty which
would compensate for these. From the
reports it never seemed to have entered
the heads of Board members that these
very disabilities suffered by local in-
dustry might be an indication that it
was not for us an “economic” industry,
an argument against tying up our scarce
resources of labor and capital in such
an unproductive occupation.
Mr. Rattigan told me the Board
needs to work toward defining its opera-
tional principles. He says that nothing
was done while the Vernon Committee
was sitting because it did not want a
duplication of effort. Since then the
Board has been trying to work out just
what the Committee recommended.
Only now is it free to work on its own.
The last annual report is a pathbreaker.
The Board agrees that it should aim at
“greater precision in stating the con-
siderations which determine its recom-
mendations” and speaks of a greater
need “for the discriminating use of
tariffs already inherent in the policy
of limiting tariff assistance to ‘economic
and efficient industries.’ ” “Such a
policy,” it goes on, “is designed to . . .
ensure as far as possible, that resources
are employed in areas where economic
benefits are the greatest. A policy de-
signed to encourage economic develop-
ment necessarily involves discrimination
against uneconomic production.”
Despite a division of opinion on
whether a “benchmark tariff” is suit-
able as an instrument for measuring
whether industry is economic and
worthy of encouragement through
tariff protection, this represents a
breakthrough. It is an emphatic re-
jection of the illogical “needs prin-
ciple” of determining tariffs, a prin-
ciple which leads by its logic to a
cumulative process of ever-increasing
tariffs. The cotton yarn makers “need”
greater protection, and get it; this means
that the clothmakers need more too,
and so on. In this journey toward a
siege economy, the advantages of inter-
national specialisation are lost.
Perhaps the greatest weakness in
Mr. McEwen’s new arrangements is
that the Office of Secondary Industry
is both a representative of the manu-
facturing industry and a body that is
supposed to make impartial reactions
to Tariff Board recommendations. There
is a danger that tariff protection should
come to be regarded as a kind of
costless benefit that no industry should
be without. Tariff protection is not a
matter that affects only the manufac-
turing industries, yet the organisation
that is charged with looking after the
general interests of secondary industry
and (to use Mr. Callaghan’s words)
“the industry with a problem” also
makes tariff policies. Even the Trade
Relations Board of the Department of
Trade can no longer exercise a modify-
ing influence, yet protection policies
may make it more difficult to gain con-
cessions for our exports.
When he goes, the set-up that Mr.
McEwen established as part of his
general political drive may not outlast
him. Under a weaker Country Party
Minister, or under a Liberal Minister,
it may simply be disbanded. But the
general argument about tariff policy is
likely to increase. Even Mr. Callaghan
has contributed to the spreading fore-
boding about present policy. He has
spoken of possible future work being
done on “an analysis of the social
costs and benefits to the community of
the various sectors of industry” and
also on “the comparative advantages
of major industries.” So far his actual
policy appears to lack any semblance
of this. It is a muddled strategy of
responding to individual demands for
protection as they come along, without
the slightest concern for their implica-
tions for other industries, or for the
economy as a whole. It is blind adhoc-
cery, Government direction without
economic principle or planning.
At least we might be spared the
kind of ridiculous claim, made recently
in Parliament by Mr. McEwen, that
the “great bulk of the Australian work-
force find their employment behind the
shelter of (existing) tariffs.” This is
the sheerest propaganda. The facts are
that 62 percent of the workforce are
employed in services and building, 11
percent in primary industries, and only
27 percent in manufacturing. At least
a half of this 27 percent work in indus-
tries not protected by tariffs and a
good proportion of the firms in pro-
tected industries could continue even on
lower levels of protection. Mr.
McEwen also neglects completely the
possibility of programs for gradually
shifting people out of non-viable fields
of employment. Fears of unemploy-
ment in this day and age are unfounded
and politicians merely indicate their
desperation by appeals to such
irrelevant emotions.
Indiscriminate high tariffs can divert
our resources from their best use and
lessen our capacity for economic
growth. They reduce the resources we
have for defence and development.
They slow the improvement of living
standards and thereby undermine our
long-term capacity to attract migrants
and build our nation. Every Australian
dollar tied up in the capital of an
inefficient textile plant or an
uneconomic chemical works is a dollar
less for opening up the really profitable
investments to be had in natural gas
and mineral development, a dollar less
to compete with foreigners for the
ownership of national resources.
The whole vision of building a closer
relationship with Asian countries de-
pends on a liberal approach to trade,
and the willingness to look for mutual
benefits through each specialising in the
production of what we can do best and
importing the rest. Mr. McEwen’s
tariff policies are as old and irrelevant
and, in the long run, as dangerous as
the isolationism of the ’thirties in which
they are based.


OPERA HOUSE:
IT IS NOT in the newspapers and
no one is really prepared to talk about
it, but there is a last-ditch struggle
now going on to try to get Joern Utzon
back in charge of his Opera House.
The old contestants in the solid cam-
paigns to bring Utzon back are not in
the forefront of this last-ditch stand
taking place 14| months since he re-
signed; instead there is a quiet attempt
to encourage the leading parties on both
sides to get together and negotiate.
There is no mud-slinging, no attacks on
people’s honesty, professional integrity,
or ability. This is a real negotiating
job.
Having failed to budge the Govern-
ment by other means, it seems that
the small and dedicated group of
people who want Utzon back to finish
his Opera House are trying a different
tactic.
Those in the latest campaign were
not involved in last year’s battles to
have Utzon back and have come to
the scene in recent months. The main
one is Dr. Phillip Parsons, of the Drama
Department of the University of
N.S.W. But he seems to be closely
associated with the “The Australian’s”
drama critic, Francis Evers, who has
been running a very strong “Utzon must
come back” line.
Evers’ role is mainly to remain silent
(a difficult task for a journalist), so
that for the past two months he has
made no mention of negotiations (apart
from asserting in March: “Face saving
is beside the point. Utzon must return
with his team of acousticians to com-
plete the Opera House. We now know
that it will cost more, take longer to
complete, and probably be badly
scarred in design if Utzon is not
returned to the project”).
But the key man in the “bring Utzon
back” movement is Mr. Bill Wheat-
land, formerly Utzon’s assistant at the
Opera House, who now represents
Utzon in Australia from his office in
the Paddington terrace that Utzon had
bought and partly renovated for use as
his town house.*
Outside die present group, there are
plenty of other last ditchers around,
like the solid body of architects
employed in the Government Archi-
tect’s office who plastered Sydney with
“Bring Utzon Back” posters in March
when he made his spectacular news-
paper offer to return, or the strong
group in the Faculty of Architecture at
the University of N.S.W., or the rem-
nants of the Utzon-In-Charge Com-
mittee. But they have no role in the
current moves; they are battling men,
not negotiators. The less they do and
say at the moment, the better for
Utzon’s (very slim) chances. (But
there is nothing new in that.)
Nevertheless, Elias Duek-Cohen, a
lecturer in architecture at the Univer-
sity of N.S.W., is preparing a docu-
ment that he expects will cause a
dreadful fuss, will show that Utzon
was right and that Utzon’s critics had
acted disgracefully.
The Utzon-In-Charge committee, a
vocal and energetic band of supporters
who tried hard to get Utzon back (one
member went on a hunger strike) is
now effectively dead. The strong
gathering of notables who sat on the
platform at the enthusiastic meeting
in the Sydney Town Hall 13 months
ago has never re-assembled since then.
Only three or four people still keep
Utzon-In-Charge going, and they have
a couple of hundred dollars in kitty.
The liberal-minded, independent-
thinking people who would be attracted
to a cause like Utzon’s are also too
independent-minded to form any sort
of workable committee.
The chairman of the moribund
Utzon-In-Charge group is town-
planner Henry Epstein, and Harry
Seidler is also in the organisation.
But most of its former leaders, like
University of N.S.W. architecture lec-
turer Peter Kollar, seem to have
dropped out; Michael Nicholson, the
sculptor who fasted for a week to try
to get Utzon back, now seems to have
given up, taking the view that nothing
really can be achieved despite what he
believes to be the justice of Utzon’s
cause.
The University of N.S.W., where
Dr. Parsons works, is the centre of the
bring-Utzon-back operation. The Archi-
tecture Dean, H. Ingham Ashworth,
was a strong Utzon supporter in his
role as the real strength in the Opera
House Executive Committee (and he
fought solidly for the retention of the
dual-function major hall) but he haS
been very quiet, indeed, on the Opera
House and Utzon recently. Many of
his lecturers were on UIC.
And, of course, Professor George
Molnar is sufficiently pro-Utzon to have
resigned from the 'lnstitute of Architects
over criticism of his articles in “The
Australian” about Utzon’s acoustic
work. There is certainly a strong group
inside the Department of Works, par-
ticularly the architects’ branch, and
many of them have blighted their pro-
fessional future; no one seriously thinks
that their public service superiors do
not know of Mr. Turner and his “no-
name” associates.
And, last March, 50 architects from
the Government Architect’s office wrote
to Peter Hall claiming that Utzon was
willing to return and that it would
need negotiations by Hall with Davis
Hughes to bring this about.
But there is no mounting tide of
public opinion demanding the return of
Utzon; if the March decision to make
the major hall a concert hall only by
removing opera to the small hall did
not do it, then next month’s expected
upward revision of the $5O-million cost
estimate is not likely to create any
overwhelming demand for Utzon’s
return.
And the Sydney architectural profes-
sion seems far less ready now to rally
behind a move to bring back Utzon
than when this mission failed a year
ago (even though some leaders of that
movement were elected to the council
of the Institute of Architects in last
year’s bitter elections that followed the
Utzon affair).
Parsons has really been sounding out
the atmosphere, and so far it seems
to have been chilly. He is understood
to have talked with Peter Hall and
one of his partners in the new archi-
tectural panel, David Littlemore.
What is the nature of the approaches
made, nobody is saying at present, but
it seems that the Utzon people want
Peter Hall to make the next move.
“Professional ethics demand that if any
move to return Utzon to his Opera
House were made, it must come with
the approval of the existing architects,”
according to a Utzon supporter last
week.
But why should Hall initiate pro-


Joern Utzon and Bill Wheatland

ceedings? There seems nothing in it
for him, except the public impression
that he called to Utzon for help, rather
than the other way around. For Hall
and his partners have been asked to
do a job, and they clearly consider they
are correcting some mistakes made
earlier.
The client likes them and is satisfied
with their work; they have excellent
relations with the engineering consul-
tant and the builder, and their plans
have fitted in with the requirements of
the ABC, the Opera House’s major
potential user. Many people consider
these changes in the architectural situa-
tion at the Opera House to be more
important than questions of sticking
to UtzOn’s original concept. But until
Utzon makes a direct approach, this
issue cannot really be tested. And
with Utzon clearly not wanting to make
an approach that stood a chance of
being rebuffed, Parson’s role in sound-
ing things out is a very important one
for Utzon. Owen Tooth, a UIC man
who knows his way around, has intro-
duced Parsons to several important par-
ticipants in the Utzon drama, and has
backed up his views with drawings that
are stated to indicate that things were
far better acoustically than Utzon’s
critics have claimed.
What does Parsons expect to
achieve? He is not saying at the
moment, because he does not want to
prejudice his private campaign for
Utzon’s return. But it seems that all
he seeks is a discussion between Utzon
and the present panel in the hope that
Utzon may then be offered a position
in which he could collaborate with,
rather than replace, the panel.
But if Utzon agreed to this (and in-
dications are that he does), this would
represent a complete change from the
attitude he held last year.
Then, when Utzon had people try-
ing to negotiate for him at high levels,
he told them they were wasting their
time.
He had refused to work in the
“minor” role of design architect only,
when Davis Hughes offered him that
role; now he appears to be prepared
to discuss the prospect of an even
lesser role as a member of an archi-
tectural panel in which he was not the
only design m&n.
When Phillip Parsons was asked last
week about the state of his struggle
to get Utzon back, he said, “You’d
better talk with Bill Wheatland.”
Wheatland, Utzon’s most loyal and
persuasive supporter, is the fountain-
head from which stem all the facts
used by the movements aimed at bring-
ing Utzon back.
Wheatland himself has made no
approaches to the new panel, and the
panel appears to have no first-hand
evidence from Utzon himself that he
wants to return.
But there can be little doubt that
Joern Utzon wants to help complete
his Opera House. But he faces a difficult
choice; should he risk damage to his
legal position in his likely action for fees
against the State Government by
initiating a negotiating move to try to
get back, or should he simply chase
the fees case and forget about the pos-
sibility of returning.
The Utzon people feel there is real
urgency about getting Utzon back
before the new architectural panel go
too far along the road toward making
the major hall for concerts only and
scrapping the operatic stage machinery.
Utzon is now in Hawaii, where he
has a stake in an architectural partner-
ship involved in the home-unit busi-
ness. But his big hope, the Zurich
theatre he designed, in which he had
intended to use the architectural and
building techniques he was attempting
on the Sydney Opera House, will now
not be built. Utzon’s design, which
won the international competition for
this theatre some years ago, was strik-
ing and unusual. It is not design
problems that are holding the project
back; it is the eventual realisation of
the city authorities that the theatre was
in an impossible position for traffic
and access.
So now Utzon is quite free to come
back to Sydney. So far all his “I want
to come back” comments have been in
the newspapers—not to the people who
would be his employers or with whom
he would have to work.
“Rather than see this vision lost
forever, I am willing to come back to
Australia and work for the Minister
on mutually acceptable terms,” Utzon
said (to a newspaper) two months ago.
“I publicly appeal to the Minister
to agree to meet me to discuss these
or other possible working conditions
as I sincerely believe the Opera House
can and must be completed as it was
conceived.”
Utzon has been working again on
his Opera House drawings, accord-
ing to a letter in March to Wheatland.
He said in it that he had solved all
the acoustic and staging problems, in-
cluding that of a demountable shell for
concerts, and saw no problems having a
multi-purpose hall.
But Opera House people in Sydney
are openly sceptical of these claims,
and would want to have them proved
in black and white.
The Government is adamant that
Utzon should not return: “We have no
intention of inviting him back,” the
Premier, Mr. Askin, said last month, and
Davis Hughes (at present away on a
world trip) says the same thing, but in
stronger language.
Despite the unwillingness of Utzon’s
solicitors to damage his position in
respect of any future action for fees
by making approaches to come back, it
seems that this is what will have to
happen if there is to be any chance of
Utzon returning.


SYDNEY UNIVERSITY
The Humphreys affair
Student meetings rallied behind Humphreys.
By DAVID ARMSTRONG
IN THE ’FIFTIES, university students
in the English-speaking world were
notoriously apathetic about political
issues, both inside and outside the
campus. Now this has changed. The
“student revolt” at Berkeley, Cali-
fornia, in 1964-65 was a product of
the change, and a major cause of
further change. Some of the issues
raised by events in Berkeley were raised
in the miniature by the recent row over
the disciplining of Mr. Max Hum-
phreys, a psychology research student
at Sydney University.
At the beginning of this academic
year the University Library increased
the fines on students for overdue books.
The questions of fines, and of consulta-
tion with students before they were
increased, were taken up by a loosely
organised group, Student Action for
the Rights of Students (SARS), in
which Mr. Humphreys played a lead-
ing role, and by “honi soit,” the
student newspaper, and the Students’
Representative Council.
However, the particular matter of the
fines and lack of consultation did not
seem to be major sources of grievance.
A sit-in at the Library was organised
for the night of April 6, but there were
only 50 or so students, including Mr.
Humphreys, present when the Library
closed at 10 o’clock.
Here the University administration
made its first mistake. Instead of
simply permitting the sit-in—there is
already quite a tradition of peaceful
sit-ins in Australian university libraries
—the students were lectured, threat-
ened with disciplinary action, and a
few forcibly ejected. The result was
that a SARS pamphlet distributed next
morning, and calling for another sit-in,
hardly mentioned the fines. It con-
centrated on the far more exciting and
explosive issue of the behaviour of the
authorities and the University police
the night before.
Next morning, Mr. Humphreys was
approached by University police while
distributing the pamphlets. These were
confiscated, and, although accounts
differ as to whether he “resisted
arrest” or not, he was finally taken
forcibly to the office of the Assistant
Principal, Mr. W. H. Maze. (Mr.
Maze is widely believed to be respon-
sible for the Administration’s “hard
line.”) Later that morning Mr.
Humphreys was called before the Vice-
Chancellor and told that he would be
charged with “showing gross contempt
of authority and inciting others to do
the same.”
One must comment that it seems
quite at variance with University
tradition that forcible arrest should be
contemplated in such circumstances.
Mr. Humphreys’ name was known.
Could he not simply have been asked
to attend Mr. Maze’s office? Failure
of compliance would have been a
legitimate ground for further complaint
against him. Again, charges like “gross
contempt of authority” are ones that
a university disciplinary authority
should be extremely chary of bringing,
and probably should never bring. A
specific charge could have been made.
The Proctorial Board is the discip-
linary board of the University. It
consists of the Vice-Chancellor, the
Chairman of the Professorial Board, and
four Deans of Faculties. After one
adjournment, Mr. Humphreys, on April
13, was suspended from candidature for
his reasearch degree until 1968. This
was an exceedingly harsh penalty,
which could even have had the effect
of ending his academic career. An
unsatisfactory feature of the proceed-
ings was that the Board debated its
findings and sentence in the presence
of the Librarian and Mr. Maze, who
were Mr. Humphreys’ accusers, but in
the absence of Mr. Humphreys.
What was previously a small incident
immediately became the Humphreys
affair. The next day there was a
protest meeting with real numbers for
the first time —more than 1000 students.
Although the crowd was orderly, they
moved into the quadrangle and shouted
“Justice for Humphreys” outside the
Vice-Chancellor’s window. There was
a much larger sit-in than before at the
Library that night. The SRC had
already been involved, its president,
Mr. Geoffrey Robertson, having been
allowed to act as “prisoner’s friend” at
the hearings. But now an unofficial
student-staff committee sprang into
existence and circulated a petition.
Demands for increased student parti-
cipation in University decision making
were made and listened to.
In any modern university there is
considerable latent ill-feeling between
the academics and the administration.
(Deans, although professors in Aus-
tralia, tend to gravitate toward the
administration.) If the administration
behaves harshly toward students, it is
always possible that many of the
academics, who, in any case, generally
profess attachment to liberal values,
will support the students. This hap-
pened at Berkeley. It happened at
Sydney, too. The Sydney University
Association of University Teachers
was quick to pass a resolution deplor-
ing the severity of the sentence and to
set up a joint committee with the SRC
with the object of getting the adminis-
ration to change its stand.
At this point the administration came
to its senses. The Vice-Chancellor indi-
cated on Monday, the 17th, that the
Board was prepared to reopen the
case, and there were clear hints that
a face-saving solution was being sought.
After the rehearing on the 20th, the
Board decided, both “in the light of
new evidence” and in view of what was
in fact a minimal acknowledgement of
error and assurance of future good
conduct by Mr. Humphreys, to suspend
the sentence pending Mr. Humphreys’
good behaviour.
However, in announcing its new de-
cision the Board saw fit to add that it
“wished to make it known that the un-
authorised occupation of university
buildings cannot be condoned and that
this Board will take a serious view of
any cases brought to its notice.” A
threat of this sort is simply an invita-
tion to campus radicals to find some
new issue on which they can test the
“right to peaceful protest” and, with
any luck, start a much bigger row.
All the same, I think it is the wide
issues that were raised by the radicals,
though remote from the ostensible
cause of the affair, that are the ones
the University should start thinking
about. Despite the administration’s
regrettable lapse, fortunately recovered,
into outmoded authoritarian attitudes
on this occasion, students in the Aus-
tralian universities enjoy a great deal
of political freedom. In this respect
they are far better off than those in the
more paternalistic U.S. universities —
they are far better off than at Berkeley,
for instance. The thinking or feeling
student’s problem in a large Australian
university is rather the sense of aliena-
tion from, and lack of participation in,
the working of a mass organisation.
He is near to, yet infuriatingly remote
from, the “academic tradition” of study
and learning for its own sake.
The problem needs much thought.
And perhaps this thought should take
the preliminary form of throwing up
as many suggestions as possible for
discussion and criticism. A hundred
flowers should bloom. But it would be
a great mistake to think that it is an
easy matter to solve. For, in fact, it is
part of the desperately difficult
problem of the “quality of life” in a
prosperous mass society.

“YOU SEE THAT portrait. It is of
the Archbishop of Ireland at the time
of Charles I’s execution. He saw the
execution. At times when I get very
angry with my father I say he looks
like the Archbishop. The Archbishop
is our ancestor.” The daughter of Com-
mander Craster C. M. Usher, RN
(Ret.), was talking about her father,
the best-known of Australian letter-
writers, who for 20 years has kept up
an endless stream of comment to the
Sydney Press on scores of subjects,
most notably the Commonwealth,
Africa, Australia’s defence, and the
monarchy.
True-blue British, his sandy hair
turning grey, apple-cheeked, with
twinkling brown eyes in sunbursts of
wrinkles, wearing a green cardigan,
grey shirt and slacks, he seemed far
removed from the irascible naval
presence conjured up by a leafing
through the files of old newspapers.
His house, called Rhodes, in a
Hornsby street called Pretoria Parade
(he has always been concerned with
Rhodesia and South Africa), is
crammed with knick-knacks; on the
veranda, the current Bulletin, pub-
lished the day before I was there, was
thrust into a rubbish box, a Union
Jack poked out of an umbrella-stand
in the hall, and the living-room walls
were coated with oval paintings of his
ancestors, pictures of Walter Scott and
the Queen, mementoes of Nelson (god-
father to an ancestor of the Ushers),
pictures of ships in which the Com-
mander sailed.
A silver cigarette case his daughter
showed me bore the names of all the
ships in which he had served. At one
stage, he had run a gunboat up the
Yangtse, and “in 1937 I was com-
mander-in-chief, RN, of the South
African Navy—which consisted of one
survey ship, two officers, and six survey
ratings.”
Retiring to Australia in the ’forties,
the Commander had settled in Sydney
and begun his monumental correspon-
dence to the Press. He had an average
of one letter published a week, although
during a given week he might write
several others which weren’t published.
It took him 20 minutes to write a
letter, sketching it out in pencil in first
draft, then reworking and polishing it
as though it were an essay.
He used to send copies of letters to
different papers, but had abandoned
this practice. He got 70 percent of
letters submitted into the “Telegraph,”
20 percent into The Bulletin, and
almost none into “The Australian.”
(“I’m inclined to think I’m persona
non grata with that publication.”) He
had no other hobbies except collecting
stamps.
When had he started? “In 1947. At
the time of the election in that year.
There was an outcry against Menzies
and I wrote to ‘The Sydney Morning
Herald’ that people had been dazzled
by the real or false light of Dr. Evatt
into undervaluing Menz'es.
“But later on I had trouble with ‘The
Sydney Morning Herald.’ They wrote
a leading article entitled ‘A Chronicle
of Long Ago.’ I rather lampooned it
in ‘The Australian Liberal.’ The article
used the parallel of the self-advancing
barons of yore, in claiming that the
politicians in Australia were putting up
their own salaries. I wrote a piece in
similar vein called ‘A Chronicle of Not
So Long Ago,’ in which I pointed out
that Press barons referring, of course,
to Henderson were doing things that
were similar. From that moment on, the
‘Herald’ has published no more letters
of mine, although one did sneak
through” the Commander’s eyes
were bright with excitement “ only
one ■ —- which congratulated the then
editor, Angus Maude, on a review he
had written of the memoirs of Anthony
Eden.
“And my daughter sneaked one in,
too. Pointing out that the British
Regency Act had been altered rather
improperly to cut out the Duke of
Edinburgh as regent in the event of
the death of the Queen and to include
Princess Margaret in that capacity in-
stead. They shouldn’t, as my daughter
who is an expert in these matters
said, have altered the constitution in
this way at all. My daughter, by the
way, wc*rks on the night desk at UPI,
which was first in bringing the news of
the assassination of President Kennedy
into Australia.
“Republicanism? A Republic of Aus-
tralia. It’s not a question of ‘will it,’
but ‘when’ ... Of course, if it were
to be put to a referendum at the turn
of the century, I would refuse to vote,
as a protest gesture at the whole un-
democratic Australian system of com-
pulsory voting.
“That system goes back to the
‘twenties. When some political parties
wanted to save the costs of transport-
ing people to the polls. Defence? I
agree with Sir Robert Menzies about
great and powerful friends, but we
must stop talking about what Britain is
not going to do East of Suez and see
what Australia is going to do.
“Now, about Cockburn Sound. In
August last year Holt said a survey
should be made. Not until March this
year has the survey been started. How
long will it take? And all this slowness
regardless of the fact that in 1910
Admiral Henderson advised the con-
struction of a naval base there, and in
1919 Admiral Jellicoe” Usher had
been junior lieutenant on Jellicoe’s
ship the New Zealand “had said
that Port Stephens was suitable. In
1817, in fact, Captain James Sterling
spoke of Cockburn Sound as a good
anchorage.
“Rhodesia? Like Australia, it has had
a monarchy by proxy. Advice, though,
from Australia to the Crown is accepted
without question. Advice from Rhodesia
has gone to English Parliament. Smith
can advise that they in Rhodesia have
full Dominion status and Wilson can
throw it out. Rhodesia was promised
Dominion status. When they started the
Central African Foundation, Southern
Rhodesia, Nyasaland, and Northern
Rhodesia were told if they co-operated
Commander Cr aster C. M. Usher, RN.
they would get full independence. The
last two got it, but not the first. Smith’s
was technically a rebellion only in the
sense of the American colonies’ revolt.
“Wilson . . . the most unscrupulous
and cleverest politician since Lloyd
George. I’m very glad I left England
in 1937. I’d rather remember it as it
was. Holt? His smile is his worst
feature. People say, ‘Won’t he take that
grin off his face?’ But he’s an able man.
“Do you know, we’ve been troubled
by nuisance phone calls? At first they
simply rang us and hung up.”
“But” Commander Usher’s daugh-
ter now took up the theme, almost in
mid-sentence “an hour before you
rang to arrange this interview the other
day someone rang up claiming to be
from the ‘Telegraph’ and asked us if
we’d had a letter in it recently.
Obviously a prank. We said, ‘Oh, yes,
we had one in just this morning as it
happens.’ Then you rang. I’m bound
to say that we thought the visit of
Charles Higham was” fatheiUand
daughter smiled in unison “nothing
more than a well, a hoax . . .”

OVERSEAS
Hatred of the Chinese runs
amok in Indonesia
WITH THE SPECTACLE of
Sukarno’s rustication over, Indonesians
are returning to their old and favorite
diversion of Chinese-baiting. There
have been increasingly frequent reports
of Chinese shops being occupied,
Chinese homes ransacked, and Chinese
merchants beaten and jailed. None of
this is news in Indonesia, where the
Chinese are accustomed to having a
rough time of it.
But when the harassment became so
intense as to bring the normally pas-
sive Chinese out into the streets in
protest demonstrations, and Peking and
Djakarta into a new round of their on-
off slanging contest, with an uncere-
monious booting-out of each other’s
key diplomats, the old underlying
malignancy of anti-Chinese feeling was
ready to spread rapidly.
The latest turbulence began with
anti-Government demonstrations by
Chinese in Djakarta, East Java, and
other parts of the country, events for
which the Government quickly blamed
the Chinese Embassy.
It may be that China’s representa-
tives in Djakarta did have a hand in
mobilising the demonstrators; they may
also have provided the “provocative
pamphlets” whose distribution last
month was said to have sparked off the
disturbances. But if Peking is using its
local citizens to stir up trouble for
Indonesia, the Indonesian Government
is also using the popular bogy of
Peking to cover up an ugly and
embarrassing domestic disease.
Scratch an Indonesian, almost any
Indonesian, and he will admit that he
hates the Chinese. This deep emo-
tional antipathy long pre-dates the
beginnings of tension with China and
in fact remained strong, if suppressed,
even during the heyday of President
Sukarno’s Djakarta-Peking axis. Like
the Jews in the West, the Chinese
were resented for their economic
dominance and their cultural separa-
tism, as well as for the special privi-
leges granted to them by the Dutch.
So, for years, anti-Chinese feelings
simmered along, boiling over periodi-
cally in national campaigns, such as
the drive against Chinese merchants
in 1960, and then subsiding. But on
September 30, 1965, the Chinese Com-
munists gave the Indonesians a new
excuse to launch a particularly
ferocious round of reprisals.
China’s involvement in the attempted
coup by the Indonesian Communist
Party, the PKI, was probably limited
to supplying arms and advisers. But
because of the close party ties, China
was linked with the PKI as the target
of anti-Communist revulsion. And
implicated with China were the local
Chinese.
The implication was not altogether
unjustified. Although only about
250,000 of the 3,000,000 Chinese
in Indonesia are document-carrying
citizens of Communist China (1.5 mil-
lion are Indonesian citizens and 1.2
million others are stateless), the
Chinese community in Indonesia did
have a special relationship with the
Indonesian Communist Party. As a
persecuted minority, the Chinese sought
protection and the Communist Party
Furniture and documents go up in fiery reprisals at Djakarta’s Chinese Embassy.
was the only group in Indonesia that
offered it. Accordingly, Chinese mer-
chants paid in sizable sums to Com-
munist coffers, and the leading Chinese
organisation, the Baperki, formed close
relations with the PKI.
After the coup, with the PKI out-
lawed and the Baperki disbanded, the
Chinese were defenceless. Nobody
knows how many perished in the post-
coup slaughter, but they were many.
A long series of protests from Peking
only exacerbated the situation and
resulted in raids on China’s diplomatic
offices, increased attacks on local
Chinese, and the closing down of
Chinese schools, newspapers, and social
organisations. Thousands of Chinese
were interned in detention camps in
North Sumatra and over 3000 fled to
China on Chinese ships.
Indonesia’s new Acting President,
General Suharto, is thought to be
opposed to the anti-Chinese campaign,
if only on the practical grounds that,
as his economic advisers tell him,
Chinese businessmen are vital to the
precarious Indonesian economy and
effectively control secondary industry
and the retail sector. Also anti-Chinese
outbursts frighten foreign investors.
But to stop the anti-Chinese drive,
General Suharto would have to move
against the student action groups who
have been leading it, and their sup-
porters in the Muslim parties. And,
more important, he would have to
clamp down on the corrupt local army
commanders who have been milking
Chinese for protection money and using
anti-Chinese sentiment to bolster their
positions as local warlords. All this
could be politically dangerous. So
Suharto is biding his time.
While the generals have not yet set
out a Chinese policy or assigned respon-
sibility for directing Chinese affairs,
they have privately approved a set of
policy guidelines. These include elim-
inating one of the major causes of
dissension within the Chinese com-
munity—the classification by race
rather than citizenship. Ethnic Chinese
who have been Indonesian for genera-
tions are so resentful of being made to
suffer for Peking or local Peking
sympathisers that they tend to become
defensively anti-Chinese themselves.
Recently some Indonesian Chinese in
East Java issued a statement urging the
Government to expel all alien and
stateless Chinese from the country.
But even the radical students realise
that three million Chinese cannot be
moved and they have settled on a fall-
back position of wide-scale assimil-
ation. Today Indonesia’s citizenship
rolls are closed. The generals’ policy

❖ Shell is exploring for oil
❖ Shell is refining
❖ Shell products meet the needs

ture
❖ Shell fuels win car races

tional, sporting and cultural acti-
vities. Yes, Shell is certainly
everywhere.
You can be sure of Shell
guide calls for reopening them and
promoting assimilation —but not to the
point, advocated by some Indonesian
Chinese, of erasing all traces of
Chineseness, beginning with names.
The policy proposal also, inevitably,
calls for some restrictions on Chinese
economic activity. But the generals
have conceded that first Indonesians
must be trained to take the Chinese
place.
Unless General Suharto interposes
himself between the Chinese and Indo-
nesia’s Green Guards, the Chinese in
Indonesia will continue to be infinitely
vulnerable.
The only organ concerning itself
with the fate of the Chinese is a Gov-
ernment-associated group called the
Institute for Fostering National Unity,
which the Chinese consider to be
bureaucratic and cowardly. Yet no
self-defence group has emerged within
the Chinese community for fear of
reprisals.
Since the coup in 1965, not a single
prominent Indonesian has come out in
public protest against the persecution
of the Chinese. Indonesia’s civil liber-
tarians—most of them from the banned
socialist party —are in too dicy a posi-
tion themselves to speak out. And
most other Indonesians do not want to.
So the political pressures on General
Suharto favor a continued hands-off
policy. It may be only the economists
who can save the Chinese.
(An "Economist" report)
Singapore
Where's the doctor?
WITH THE PALLIATIVE pill,
coated with promises of staged, not
wholesale, withdrawal of British forces
well and truly swallowed, Singaporeans
this week found the medicine doing
them not much good at all.
Looking ahead to April, 1968, when
between 18,000 and 23,000 British per-
sonnel will have packed up for home,
the island State plainly felt the need
for some further tranquillising. But
with the recent “consulting specialist”
Defence Minister Denis Healey back in
London, his “rooms” in Singapore were
temporarily closed.
The army, air, and naval bases on
Singapore island employ directly more
than 30,000 civilians, supporting, prob-
ably, 200,000 of a population of two
million. There can be no fixed propor-
tion between the number of civilian
employees and any given total of troops
and dependants, but each soldier, sailor,
or airman has an average of two de-
pendants and their local spending alone
averages more than £25 million a year.
Singapore’s trade unions, reflecting
gloomy local opinion, have already
dived in with demands for improved
gratuity and redundancy benefits.
No one hesitates to emphasise the risk
of a reaction to unemployment.
Reluctant British military adminis-
trators might conceivably accept the
elimination of, say, Seletar, one of the
three air bases on the island, which is
used for short-range air transport.
There could also be streamlining at
the naval base and dockyard, which
was servicing more than 80 warships
during confrontation. On the Malayan
mainland are the three bases of
Kota Tinji (a jungle training school),
Terendak, near Malacca, and Butter-
worth, near Penang.
Australia’s involvement is complex
and delicate. The External Affairs
Minister’s (Mr. Hasluck) denunciation
of a “feckless” Albion whose perfidy
has not yet been fully established leaves
Australia open to a warm invitation
to share the cost of the Singapore bases
—say £25 million, or one quarter of
the total British commitment.
Singapore’s Prime Minister, Mr. Lee
Kuan-yew, has said that he would not
welcome an American takeover,
although he has often suggested that
the Americans might help to subsidise
the British. An imprudent observation
in 1965 that he could order the British
out of Singapore at 24 hours’ notice
and invite the Russians in is recalled
today only by the uncharitable.
Denuded of the bases, however,
Singapore would become a naked and
exposed outpost surrounded by Malays
to the north and Malays in Indonesia.

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Youth being served well
By APRIL HERSEY
THE AUSTRALIAN THEATRE for
Young People is due for a change of
name. Its executive secretary Diana
Sharpe, who is the wife of actor/
producer and chairman of the board
of the theatre Alistair Duncan, doesn’t
know what its new name should be but
she feels that the existing one sounds
dull —and the organisation is anything
but dull.
The latest play, due for Sydney’s
Killara Community Theatre from
May 12 to 20, has already had a re-
christening. Originally called “The
Voyage of the Endeavour” it has been
changed to “95 Men and a Nannygoat.”
Remembering the disappointments
that occurred when a play about a circus
had no lions and tigers, Miss Sharpe
has obtained a nannygoat, rather
elderly but nevertheless prepared to do
her part for the children. Her part
has not yet been written in by the
John Craig as Charles Green in Rob
Inglis’ “Ninety-five Men and a Nanny-
goat,” presented by the Australian
Theatre for Young People.
author, Rob Inglis, who has achieved
95 Men” between marathon perform-
ances of Canterbury Tales, his one-man
show.
His is not the only writing commis-
sion that the three-year-old theatre has
given out. Plays for children are in
short supply around the world and at
the present time Eleanor Witcombe is
working on a Christmas offering. She
will be paid $5OO, part of the
$3OOO given by the N.S.W. Cultural
Grants Committee to the Australian
Theatre for Young People. Last year
the grant was only $2OOO.
It would be hard to overlook the
worthiness of this particular group
which seems to have grown initially
from the enthusiasm of a few people
like Eleanor Witcombe and the Dun-
cans. It was kicked off with a loan
of $lO from actress Wendy Blacklock.
Now the N.S.W. Arts Council acts as
Big Brother and receives additional
grant money, some of which can be
used directly for the Theatre for Young
People, though it must also stretch to
cover other activities.
The bulk of the audiences are in the
schools and the theatre provides pro-
fessional performances of plays for
thousands of youngsters in New South
Wales, from five to 18. One tour was
seen by 40,000 last year. Seven com-
panies are at the moment packed into
Arts Council buses rolling their way
from the sophisticated suburbs to the
hot mulga country.
There are stringent rules set down
by the Department of Education.
Infants and primary children can only
be charged 20 cents, seniors 35 cents.
No play can take longer than an hour.
The infants are entertained “in the
round” because they are inclined to be
frightened unless they have someone
sitting near them. The primary groups
(8-12) like pace in their plays whether
it is comedy or adventure. It must move.
The Monmouth rebellion was a great
success. Once the senior years are
reached plays must be part of the pre-
scribed reading. Each show plays for
two solid years (with merciful changes
of cast provided) in order to cover the
territory.
Diana Sharpe is so enthusiastic about
the project that she seems to have sub-
limated her own ambitions to act. She
is combination trouble-shooter and
lonely-hearts representative for the
touring companies. “I always get to
see each company once a month. Then
we can iron out problems and solve
personality difficulties as they arise,”
she said. Enmity on the western plains
is to be avoided, she feels, “because it
always shows up in performances.”
From the beginning the Theatre for
Young People has paid “better than
Equity rates wherever possible” and
the best actors and producers have been
hired for that most discerning audi-
ence, children.
Shakespeare has been left to the
Young Elizabethans and the Theatre
for Young People has concentrated on
“She Stoops to Conquer” and “The
Tale of Two Cities” type of drama,
heavily laced with “Puss in Boots”
and pieces like “Search out the
Rebel.” They have also contributed
the poetic “Fire on the Snow,” and this
year will do Pinter’s “The Caretaker”
as well as “Treasure Island” and “95
Men and a Nannygoat” for the blood-
thirsty primaries.
“But we must get a roof over our
heads,” Diana Sharpe said. “There is
something about a building that seems
to inspire trust in committees who
make grants. At the moment we are
so mobile I feel they don’t think we
are too stable. Though the place to
take the shows is obviously out where
the children are waiting.”
And she hurried off to pick up the
nannygoat in order to introduce her
to the author.
Music
Blockhouse
By DAVID SALTER
Smetana String Quartet. Musica Viva.
Town Hall, Sydney.
THE INTRIGUING THING about
Beethoven’s Grosse Fuge finale to the
Op. 130 String Quartet is that, under
normal circumstances, it is far more
successful in score than it is in per-
formance. A monstrous movement even
by contemporary standards, this jour-
ney to the outer reaches of counter-
point presents problems of interpreta-
tion quite separate from others unique
to the late-Beethoven.
How is one to deal with a lengthy
slab of music which seems almost self-
destructive in the way it tears at and
dissects its very substance? In their
recital last week for Musica Viva, the
Smetana Quartet realised a completely
effective solution by preserving a single
stylistic precept—clarity.
With the spirit and precision of a
Baroque craftsman, each piece of this
fantastic thematic masonry was care-
fully shaped and fitted until it formed
a blockhouse of absolute music. It was
a magnificent finale to a wonderful
performance. The Smetana are above
all consumate strategists and it is this
tightly unified sense of masterplan
which emerges as their most distinctive
quality.
Despite their practice of playing
from memory, the group produces a
smaller sound than one would expect
from a quartet of international stand-
ing. While this slightly reduced volume


had little significance in the Schubert
Quartettsatz or even in the
Beethoven, it was noticeable by absence
in Martinu’s Quartet No. 4.
Films
Workhorse
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
After The Fox. Director, Vittorio de
Sica.
IT IS HARDLY fair to expect even
such an accomplished comedian as
Peter Sellers to do all the work in a
film, but he is pretty well on his own
in “After The Fox.” Neil Simon’s
script provides some amusing lines,
Vittorio de Sica comes up with a few
entertaining sight gags; but in general
the responsibility for making the audi-
ence laugh rests squarely and a little
heavily on Sellers’ shoulders.
He is on the screen almost con-
tinuously, and there are times when it
seems he’d give a good deal to get away
behind the scenes and relax with his
feet up.
The Fox is an energetic but none
too successful Italian crook, who, after
his umpteenth escape from prison, sees
the chance to hijack a load’ of gold
bars, spoils of a masterly robbery in
Egypt. The Fox relies heavily on dis-
guises; this gives Sellers the opportunity
to appear variously as a priest, a Cara-
biniere, a neo-realist film director, and
-—in perhaps the best-written sequence
in the picture an American sight-
seer from a tourist bus.
Vittorio de Sica is an ebullient
director, who can produce individual
scenes of considerable liveliness, but to
my mind, he has never made a film
and this includes “Bicycle Thieves”
which really coheres. Think back on
any of his movies and you are likely
to remember isolated sequences rather
than any strong general impression of
the film itself. Think back on “After
The Fox” and you’ll hardly remember
de Sica at all, except curiously enough
in his brief appearance as an actor. No
doubt the picture was conceived as a
“vehicle” for Peter Sellers, but it is
a pity that it has so little fuel and at
least two flat tyres.
Theatre
On a shoestring
By MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
THE TIME is nine o’clock in the
morning, the place a school assembly
hall, the audience rows of uniformed
schoolchildren. There is little or no
scenery and few props: two or three
book flats for the ogre’s castle and the
little pig’s house, a stool, a ladder, some
large, black wooden cubes for stacking,
to represent the battlements of Elsinore
or the Nantucket wharf. The actors
may have simple costumes and make-
up or none at all.
You might think this not conducive
to fostering a love of drama in school-
children, but I doubt if the lack of
lavish resources for creating illusion
matters very much. This simple, day-
light presentation brings the child
audience closer to the young actors. The
challenge it presents to the imagina-
tion of the audience and the skill of
the actors seems to be cheerfully met.
The necessity for thrift is an im-
portant reason for this simplicity of
presentation, but there is also the need
for mobility. The Arts Council in
N.S.W. (part of the national organisa-
tion) has to stretch its State Govern-
ment subsidy to cover the cost of tour-
ing its many programs of drama, ballet,
music, opera, and some art exhibitions
throughout the length and breadth of
New South Wales. There are two
separate schedules of tours, one for
adults and for schools, but quite a
number of the programs appear in both
touring circuits.
Some of these programs have been
or will be presented in Sydney theatres
during the year. Peter O’Shaughnessy’s
lively program of readings and recita-
tions from Australian literature, “You
Wouldn’t Read About It” (The
Bulletin, 21.1.67) was presented at the
Peninsula Theatre, Avalon. John
Llewellyn’s Dylan Thomas program was
performed at the Wayside Chapel,
King’s Cross, and Rob Inglis’ “Canter-
bury Tales” is to be seen at the Inde-
pendent next week.
Peter O’Shaughnessy’s discussion of
“King Lear” for matriculation students,
which I attended at the Dover Heights
Girls’ High School, is a kind of one-
man “Lear in Camera” without all the
irritating gimmicks of Harold Lang’s
“Macbeth in Camera.” Anyone who
thinks that Shakespeare’s plays were
written to be acted (some critics think
this unimportant) and that meaning
may become clearer on the stage, is
always interested to hear what an
articulate actor or producer has to say
about the plays. Peter O’Shaughnessy
was an impressive Lear in his own ex-
citing production in Melbourne in 1957.
In this lecture he discusses the main
characters and how he thinks they
should be acted, illustrating by acting
now Lear, now Goneril, now the Fool,
now Edgar, until the stage seems
peopled by a company.
The Young Tote Company’s three
programs: an abridged “Hamlet,” an
acting. version of “Moby Dick,” and
an anthology of poetry and song, all
three adapted and produced by Alex-
ander Hay, are presented with great
liveliness by the nine young NIDA
graduates.
However, the verve and skill with
which they perform mime and move-
ment is not matched by the quality of
their verse-speaking. I think this is a
special difficulty for Australian
students, but it is one which NIDA
should attend to, because it is hard
to believe that these bright young
people would not respond to rigorous
training. Their renderings of the comic
items in the anthology program, espec-
ially those like “Casey Jones,”
“Waltzing Matilda,” and “Widdicombe
Fair” which are done by the whole
company, are delightful exercises in
timing and chorus work.
For primary-school children there is
a beautifully costumed and well-acted
performance of “The Wind in the Wil-
lows,” produced by Noelann Gandon
of the Independent Theatre. For the
infants there is a delightful program
of three fairytales, dramatised and pro-
duced by Vonne Thomas of the Aus-
tralian Theatre for Young People.
Parents who are interested in the
arts have reason to be grateful to the
Arts Council for their schools pro-
grams. Of course the Arts Council is
short of money, but it does appear to
husband its limited resources very
thriftily, with no sign of unnecessary
extravagance. At the same time it pays
the artists well, which ensures a high
standard, and in some cases a very
high standard indeed.
Young courage
By PHILLIP ADAMS
Mother Courage and Her Children.
Brecht. Melbourne Youth Theatre.
BACK on my foundered hobby-horse.
In the last ten years in commercial
theatre in this country we’ve had a
funeral procession of Broadway
comedies and a cacophony of Merry
Widows and Funny Girls. If the
theatres’ ratings system was applied
with equal vehemence to our art gal-
leries, they’d toss out the Rembrandts
and hang plaster ducks. But there is a
resistance movement which defies the
totalitarianism of the cultural nose-
count, and its latest recruits are the
under-25s who have formed Mel-
bourne’s Youth Theatre.
Brecht’s marathon anti-war parable
is austerely written and visually spare.
Surrounded by her random collection
of illegitimates, Mother Courage lives
off the war by hawking and prag-
matism. Her religious beliefs swing
from Protestantism to Catholicism with
the military pendulum. More than
once she miscalculates and gets herself
a tragically bad bargain, but, like

Taylor in the part is like casting David
to play Goliath. Yet the girl does an
extraordinary job. She finds the subtle,
sinister meanings that Brecht concealed
between his deceptively simple lines
and delivers them with the right mix-
ture of ingenuousness and cunning.
None of the 31 lesser roles are handled
anywhere near as impressively, but
producer John Ellis maintained an
acceptable standard.
It was as a visual production that
this Mother Courage was truly memor-
able. Elijah Moshinsky surrounded his
big stage with a vast frame of hessian,
into which the actors rolled abstract
flats of torn and painted canvas to
suggest scene changes in the best epic
theatre manner. Mother and her
children were given a full-size wagon
to pull about, and, loaded with chattels,
it dominated the stage like an eerie
piece of sculpture. Moshinsky *s
soldiers were marvellously motley,
draped in army-surplus capes and
wearing tin hats, slouch hats, and
fanciful hats. There seemed to be no
plan to the costumes, yet nothing was
arbitrary.
The production incorporated some
interesting film material, and had an
original music score composed and
conducted by George Michell. Even
the poster and production stills were
first - class. After seeing too many
amateurish professional productions, it
is good to see the professionalism of
these young amateurs.
Television
Shooting stars
By FRANK ROBERTS
Showcase ’67. ITV channels.
PERHAPS THE right thing would be
to join the other television reviewers
and look charitably on all local TV
productions. One tires of being the
odd man out, the local Cassandra of
the airwaves, running down “Kain”
which everyone else admired (except
two out of five London critics); and
now, being about to turn a leery eye
on “Showcase ’67,” which opened last
week to universal praise, including its
own, “This is the show which makes
Australia’s stars.”
Of course, it does nothing of the
sort. Most of the acts in “Showcase”
are destined to vanish for ever. Most
of Australia’s “stars,” of any kind,
come up through sheer grit, including
the meteoric pop stars. The better
operatic singers on the show have other
chances, aria contests, etc., or make
their own chances (one of last year’s
“Showcase” losers, Waverney Ford,
sang in the ABC’s production of
“Manon”).
But for instrumental performers,
such as last year’s winners, “Showcase”
is the big chance, and for good lesser
artists it lives up to its name as a good
place to be spotted by an agent and
possibly get further bookings.
That should be enough to boast
about, without the nerve-honing
chatter about “making stars.” The
show also has good audience-participa-
tion value. You pick out likely artists,
the judges choose unlikely ones, but
there is a second chance. The audi-
ence may vote for your choice. It’s
a better audience game than most on
TV, but palls long before the 26 weeks
to the finals. This year Gordon Boyd
is again subdued, Hector Crawford
appears but once, and the background
settings for the acts are fine. The
sponsor, GM-H, does not shout but
stays with the mood of the show.
Opera
Out of tune
By JOHN CARGHER
Die Fledermaus. Strauss. ABC-TV.
Madame Butterfly. Puccini. ABC-TV.
MELBOURNE’S television ambitions
in the opera field were finally laid to
rest to the tunes of Johann Strauss. The
fact that “Die Fledermaus” was visu-
ally sumptuous and pictorially excellent


television made the disastrous casting
and the producer’s failure to capture
even a trace of the original’s charm
and humor all the more glaring.
The failings of “Fledermaus” were
not those of television, but of inability
to meet Johann Strauss on his own
ground. There was little wrong with
the musical aspects; the voices were
good, the orchestra played well, yet
there was a cloud hovering over the
whole production which centred on the
immovable depression created by a
dreadful English adaptation which tor-
turously spelled out every line of the
delightful plot in one-syllable words of
endless length. The utter lack of humor,
let alone wit, was further worsened by
some quite incredible casting. A weak,
foppish Eisenstein is the antithesis of
Strauss’ charming rogue and the rest of
the cast with only one exception (Mar-
garet Nisbett) were little better. The
production lasted two hours and is said
to have cost more than any other tele-
vision opera produced here. The tax-
payer received for this good viewing,
mediocre music, and only average en-
tertainment. Anyone expecting “Die
Fledermaus” was bitterly disappointed.
The Sydney - produced “Madame
Butterfly” was substantially better. The
failings here lay with Puccini and
David Belasco, who wrote the original
Kiang Hwa in the title role of “Madame
Butterfly ABC-TV.
story, which today could only find tol-
erant credence as a send-up in one of
those music-hall restaurants. Any pro-
duction on stage or screen of “Madame
Butterfly” must depend on its visual
and aural impact. The former was ex-
cellent. The naturalistic settings and
costumes allowed ample movement of
characters and cameras so that the eye
did not tire easily.
The singing was of a high standard
and the importation of an oriental for
the title role paid off handsomely.
Kiang Hwa was perhaps a rather
mature Butterfly, but she acted con-
vincingly and sang as well as or better
than any Western singer the ABC might
have found around these shores. She
was well backed by Raymond Mac-
donald’s voice and the convincing pre-
sence of David Williams, who mimed
Pinkerton for him. The other two prin-
cipals were equally good, though one
or two subsidiary characters were pre-
dictably out of place in Puccini’s
Japan. The essential thing was the suc-
cessful fusion of music, drama, and
television which is so rarely achieved.
Art
Orban's message
By ELWYN LYNN
Desiderius Orban. Rudy Komon Gal-
lery, Sydney.
Michael Shannon. Macquarie Galleries,
Sydney.
BOTH MICHAEL SHANNON and
Desiderius Orban have quite dis-
engaged themselves from commitment
to any prestigious, mainstream style
and treat, art as a playful flirtation
rather than a passionate encounter.
In 31 works and some engaging
drawings, Orban toys with a number
of styles that wander back to Dada;
his approach, though there are few
surrealistic implications, is quite like
that of Max Ernst, who chooses varied
styles to see what he can convey
through them. For Orban, too, the
medium is the message; he is uncon-
cerned with establishing, through con-
sistent imagery, an easily recognisable
identity. Just as an Ernst can look
unlike an Ernst, an Orban now can
cunningly avoid the cult of person-
ality; what must Orban think of an
age when the continual use of a device
passes for the revelation of personality?
This is related to his theory of an
artist as anti-craftsman and of the
creative impulses as opposed to displays
of technical efficiency—views that he
has propounded for many years as
teacher and in his “A Layman’s Guide
to Creative Art” (1960); but, if he
did not have such a massive reputation,
I wonder if many would not be inclined
to regard a lot of these works as trifles.
Trifles many are, but none is trivial,
however throwaway, expendable, and
ethereal they may look; Orban, too, is
opposed to the idea that a show must
look consistent through its dedication
to a theme or approach or follow the
interior decorator’s irrelevant axiom
that works should “hang together.”
Orban is playing a wilful, detached
game with his perennial creativeness—
he is now 83—and his toylike wooden
assemblages of broken, splintered
timber, his carved and painted timber
slabs, his incised paintings, perspex
boxes containing pieces of flat wood
that has been scribbled on, and his
paintings involving pieces of thin,
ruddy bark are droll pleasantries.
Some do have an oriental remote-
ness and some of his dark past shows
through; oddly enough the sombre
melancholy of his earlier work has been
called lugubrious, when actually the
still-life with which he won the Gold
Medal of the International Exhibition
at Barcelona in 1926 is a splendid
example of tenebrist romanticism.
Several works like Erlking and Abyss
preserve this gloom, but even when he
is slightly satirical, the mood is mellow.
Nightmare of a Townplanner is a city-
scape of shattered wood; Byzantium is
simply a transparent painting on a box
and lit from within maybe a spoof
of the Inner Light of Byzantine
Religious Art and Australiana is a
dull reddish-ochre landscape-collage
with pieces of authentic Antipodean
bark.
Orban’s imagination is not deeply
stirred by these games and his pieces
of curved perspex, pleasantly placed
on shimmering silver, are a trifle too
occasional, but in the wavering
arabesques that compose “Vision of
Tibet” there is a surging and refined
power.
Trite it may sound, but there is an
air of spiritual ease and undidactic and
unpedantic wisdom in the show; he
doesn’t put you on your intellectual
toes, but involves the viewer in a sly
oblique way and provides a lot of mild,
unecstatic pleasure. The drawings,
which are as excellent as they are
cheap, have a similar attractive unpre-
tentiousness.
Michael Shannon’s paintings and
drawings, mainly of North Queensland,
are volatile and relaxed; where he
places houses on stilts in a luminous
blue or mauve, he achieves an air of
buoyant weightlessness that is other-
worldly. The buildings themselves,
which look like improvisations, are
rendered with a light, improvised and
appropriate sketchiness.
Despite a lowering sky or two and a
slightly theatrical air of loneliness, the
mood remains gracefully light—even
when Mrs. Godbold’s head is huge
against a weatherboard house or a
strange breeze tosses the curtains in the
cool blue Winter Afternoon or stirs
the grey clothes that hang on the
veranda of Midday in Cairns.
The latter work has some of the
frontal treatment he once gave to
Melbourne’s corner shops with their
lurid, jumbled advertisements, and
indicates how skilful his formal dis-
positions are and how far he is removed
from mere illustration. He inciden-
tally records the Queensland scene with
a poetic exactness, can turn a drab
weatherboard house into the luminously
acidic Green Timber House and with
the lattice-work of Townsville Veranda
catches the spirit of Queensland’s
vernacular architecture.
Some do look like houses out of
“The New Yorker’s” monster cartoons
and others are made to look as though
they are part of an Australian Gothic
Revival, but like Orban’s works, most
are remarkably unforced and relaxing
—as Matisse thought art ought to be;
and sometimes is.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Regression via the Post Office
THE OBJECT of the exercise was wrong, the method of
achieving it was silly, and the timing was plain foolish.
Apart from that, the Postmaster-General came out of last
week’s sudden decision to increase Post Office charges by
a staggering $67 million a year moderately well. Instead
of looking to Mr. Hulme as the villain, the budgetary im-
plications of the whole thing have prompted everyone to
regard Mr. William McMahon and his Treasury Depart-
ment as the real initiators of the latest piece of regressive,
cost-increasing “taxation” for which the Holt Government
is responsible.
True, there is nothing really surprising in a “free enter-
prise” government trying to run its own operations at a
profit, no matter how absurd it may be to take such drastic
action to do so. But why should the Post Office make
money? It is a public service to have telephone lines
stretching out to God-knows-where; how else would parlia-
mentarians send their voluminous free telegrams all around
Australia? And surely there are some defence implications
in having a telecommunications network spread around the
Continent. The silliness of the method of increasing Post
Office revenue is clear from the refusal to charge an
economic installation fee (which may reduce the pressure
for new installations) and instead to make an absurd profit
out of telephone calls.
Quite apart from how upset N.S.W. State Liberals may
be about announcing higher telephone, telegraph, and postal
charges (hitting the decentralisation program bang on the
hip pocket) the day before a by-election for a country seat,
the worst aspect of the timing of this announcement was
that it seemed a deliberate attempt to influence the Arbitra-
tion Commission which is now discussing the basic wage.
The higher charges are not to be implemented for eight weeks
after their announcement and there is no real sense of
urgency about introducing them, judging from Mr. Hulme’s
own details of the expected loss this year; no sensible reason
has yet been given for divorcing the question of postal charges
from their normal position in the Budget Speech in August.
And those who are eagerly trying to find implications
for next August’s Budget in last week’s news may as well
stop now. It simply looks like another step in the Gov-
ernment’s already well-established policy of ad hoccery and
so bears no relation to what has happened or what will
happen on the fiscal front. In any event, the increased
charges mean that rises in Federal and State taxes and
charges in recent times will have provided the greatest
single addition to the level of costs in Australia.
MEN AND MATTERS
IN THE REFURBISHING that’s go-
ing on in more senses than one on the
upper floors of Collins House, where
North Broken Hill Ltd. resides, it has
been more a case of freshening up the
old varnish, particularly in the Baillieu-
strong board room, than splashing new
colors about. The one change in the
board room is simply that John Mad-
dern Baillieu, who succeeded his late
father (M. H. “Jack”) there, has given
up his permanent seat to his first cousin
once removed, Richard Lawrence Bail-
lieu, who at 32 is some 22 years his
junior, to become alternate director for
the chairman, Marshall L. Baillieu, his
first cousin and RL’s father.
As a stockbroker (a partner of the
family firm E. C. & L. Baillieu, which
appropriately enough is at the rear of
Collins House), JM’s part in the Bail-
lieu business play, has been mostly along
its investment trails, rather than in
executive involvement, as director of
numerous companies where these have
led, such as Carlton & United Breweries,
where he is acting chairman while Mr.
Edward Cohen is overseas.
If JM has been mainly on the finance
side of the mining world, RL, who
succeeds him on North’s board, has
won his spurs in its technical and
practical fields. After graduating in
science (majoring in chemistry and
metallurgy) at Melbourne University,
he spent a year at
North’s mine at
Broken Hill, then
further periods
with BHAS at
Port Pirie and
Electrolytic Re-
fining and Smelt-
ing’s works at
Port Kembla, be-
fore going to
Cambridge Uni-
versity to do the
Economics Tripos
and subsequently
2\ years at British Insulated Callenders
Cables in Britain. With all that under
his belt he would seem to be well
equipped not only now to take his
place on the board and be North’s new
chief executive, but ultimately to fol-
low his 65-year-old father, Marshall
Baillieu, in the chair.
OTHER MATTERS may have been
on the agenda at the recent gathering
of central bankers in Sydney. But one
thing clearly emerged from it. Nugget
nobbled Leslie about the Opera House.
Sir Leslie O’Brien, the first-ever “in-
sider” appointment as Governor of the
Bank of England who last week com-
pleted a four-week visit to Australia and
New Zealand, was a lot less guarded
about his disappointment that opera
R. L. Baillieu
M. L. Baillieu
Sir L. O’Brien
was now out of the major hall at the
Sydney Opera House than he was
about the future of sterling.
But, apart from opera, there were
many things for the two governors to
talk about: the future of sterling as a
world trading currency when Britain
enters Europe (he seemed very con-
fident about it); Australia’s policy of
holding such a disproportionate amount
of her overseas funds in sterling (he
thought it sensible and profitable, and
expected it to continue); the likely
length of the period of restraint on the
export of British capital to Australia
(quite some time was the impression
Sir Leslie gave), and whether sterling
was really over last year’s crisis (he
thought they had done rather well,
really).


The search for capital
A CONFRONTATION between Dr. Harold Bell, economic
adviser to the AMP, and Mr. D. J. Hibberd, managing
director of Comalco, on the platform of the Economic
Society’s forum in Melbourne last week was not to be.
They read their papers on different nights and, coming last,
Mr. Hibberd had, as it were, the last word. Hibberd sug-
gested strongly that, despite their change of attitude toward
the cash-flow basis of assessing the merit of minerals pro-
jects, the institutions had not yet turned over all the stones
for finding capital for such development. Earlier, Dr. Bell
had put up a good defence of the institutions, given the
assumption that the provision of more money for minerals
would oblige the institutions to leave other worthy local
borrowers short (see Croesus on page 45). A thrashing-out
of the issues involved on a public forum would have been
something to hear.
At any rate, the two must certainly have agreed, perhaps
for different reasons, that the local capital market couldn’t
do the job of finding all the funds required for mineral and
associated industrial projects alone. Mr. Hibberd, who
has had some painful experience not only in trying to
squeeze money from local sources but also in scouring the
capital markets of the world (with greater success), made
a strong case for what he called an open door in the
finance of such development. CRA’s success in raising s2Bom.
in the past few years for its aluminium and iron ore develop-
ments, he said, was achieved basically because United States
institutions are more inclined to lend against solid commer-
cial propositions which can demonstrate assured cash flows.
While in principle Mr. Hibberd pinned his colors more
firmly to the mast of overseas capital than local, he was
not despairing of the institutions coming even further for-
ward than they’ve done so far, nor of a role for the Bankers’
Development Refinance Corporation. He thought the Cor-
poration could provide “a partial answer” to the problem
of medium-term finance for major projects, especially those
under Australian ownership, provided the authorities took a
realistic view of the present world monetary situation (which
he thought likely to persist for another few years). It
could also, he said, provide some supplementary finance
over the middle term for projects with worthwhile export
potential which are not wholly Australian owned but which
have been able to find the bulk of loan finance overseas.
A noise of knockers
IT IS REALLY no wonder that economists have a reputation
for being knockers. People read in their newspapers about
that Sydney fellow Bruce Davidson knocking the North all
the time, and in Melbourne blokes like Downing knocking
the dairy industry. From New England they try to destroy
cotton. Canberra University is really unspeakable; there
was this Bruce McFarlane hitting the sacred Snowy Scheme,
but this Alex Hunter is really the limit. He is lining up
industries one by one to shoot them down. First he did over
the oil search business, saying it wasn’t worth a cracker,
and now he has taken on the idea of a national shipping
line, shooting that down in flames, too.
Of course, looking at the whole business coldly, there is
a lot to be said for a critical examination of our weaker
industries. Economic growth for the nation requires that
it should not squander its resources on weak industries, and
economists serve a useful function in pinpointing these.
But, as a matter of simple PR, it would be much better
if economists could sound a more positive note from time
to time. There are plenty of very profitable fields for in-
vestment of our resources. And academic economists would
do well to look at these occasionally. There is great popular
support for “development” and constant criticism of specific
projects creates the impression that economists are against
it. Understandable, but unfair.
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy: A Treasury White Paper sees
steadily strengthening growth in the Australian economy,
“although some gaps remained to be filled in” . . . The
British Government has resolved to make its second
application to enter the European Common Market . . .
Higher postal, telegraph and telephone charges are to
apply throughout Australia from July 1, estimated to
bring in $67 million a year.
New (private) capital spending for January-June may
fall back 4.4 percent from corresponding 1966 levels . . .
Retail sales in March, at $578 million, represent a 6.2
percent lift on March, 1966.
A record $273.4m. of exports in April, against im-
ports $264. lm., threw down a $9.3m. visible surplus.
For the markets: Most industrials met a patch
of indecisiveness on Australian share markets; metals,
and a few oils, are extremely active.
London allowed a fairly wide industrial advance,
chiefly on hopes of Bank Rate influence . . . Wall
Street has grown much more lively and optimistic.
FOr companies: Once again takeovers furnished
plenty to appeal to the connoisseur . . . With a (mer-
chant bankers’?) subtlety almost to spite itself, the two
Ingham brothers brought their company, Ingham Enter-
prises Pty., directly into their bid for Golden Poultry
Farming Industries and cleverly allied it with the erst-
while principal rival, British Tobacco; BT’s earlier
partner, Allied Mills, mysteriously vanishes and on
success of the new $1.50 offer BT will buy 40 per-
cent of the shares acquired . . . Such tortuosity is
not for Brown and Dureau, which conducts a straight-
out assets-profits defence against GKN International . . .
The party chasing Whale Industries proves to be Dal-
gety and New Zealand Loan, at 75 cents a 50 cent share.
Game to the last, and with an approaching loss of
about $300,000, motor dealer Stack’s directors still find
Industrial Equity’s offer inadequate.
To some measure of shareholder disappointment, the
issue by Henry Jones (IXL) turned out to be at one-
for-seven and demands a 25 percent premium; the half-
year’s sales are up, but margins are narrowing . . .
With 6.7 percent more sales at $82.2m., Unilever Aus-
tralia pushed earnings up by 38 percent to $2,481,000
in 1966; ice-cream and toilet preparations sections were
under pressure.
It’s obviously a struggle for agricultural chemical and
pesticide maker Amalgamated Chemicals: the 1966 pro-
fit slumped from $723,076 to $234,228; no final dividend
leaves the full year’s payment at 5 percent.
A little happiness came to builder James Wallace,
which produced a $21,072 profit for the December half
after a 1965-66 loss totalling $716,815 . . . Earthmoving
equipment dealer Tutt Bryant fell back 20 percent in
its first half, on slightly lower sales ... In the same
field, Conquip’s earnings slid 20 percent and directors
report trading still sluggish.
As if to shatter any mining complacency, Mount Isa
is forced to announce continuing operational difficulties
and has decided to hold the interim dividend at last
year’s 4 percent, thus casting doubts on a foreshadowed
full 20 percent for 1966-67 . . . More hopefully, Mount
Lyell plans to bring in its Crown Lyell No. 3 copper
ore-body, at a cost of some s2m., in about 18
months . . . Westralian Oil is to pay a 10 percent
interim (after last year’s sole 15 percent dividend) and
will increase ilmenite output; directors express some
worry about nominee holdings . . . BHP proposes to
start exploratory drilling for nickel at Mt. Monger
(near Kalgoorlie) . . . Alcoa of Australia experienced a
$1,687,881 loss in 1966 (previous year’s loss $1,852,180),
yet predicts a profitable 1967.


Money or your life
Attitudes of the institutions
By CROESUS
STICKING UP THE life offices is
for the Government only. The rest of
Australia’s money-hungry fraternity,
who enviously watch their city blocks
reach to the sky, have to apply for a
hearing even policy-holders privi-
leged to borrow their premiums back
at percent.
Nobody, to my knowledge, has pro-
duced an everyman’s guide to getting
money from the big savings institu-
tions nor, for that matter, one to help
aspiring non-resident borrowers of local
capital succeed in the task of getting
past Garrett (Mr. J. H. Garrett, First
Assistant Secretary heading the Com-
monwealth Treasury’s commerce and
industry division, which, in conjunction
with the Reserve Bank, decides if and
how much they can borrow). Such
guides would be invaluable for capital
seekers preparing to beard these people
in their dens because, although there
is an increasing number of precedents
for them to go on to gauge their
chances, the official guidelines are not
all that precise and the minds of Mr.
Garrett and the institutions are not
exactly open books.
If guide books are out, and Mr.
Garrett declines to come any closer, we
have to be all the more thankful that
last week at least one (and the biggest)
of our life companies (the AMP) let
its economic adviser (Dr. Harold F.
Bell) discourse on some current insti-
tutional attitudes at the Economic
Society’s forum in Melbourne. One pre-
sumes he wasn’t merely voicing h/s
own personal views, at any rate, all
the time.
Here, I’m afraid, I’ll have to skip
Bell’s excellent run-down of our list
of natural (as distinct from national)
resources, except to say that, as a good
AMP man from an office whose own
exercises in land development have
been outstandingly successful, it wasn t
surprising that despite deference to the
glittering minerals prospect he inclined
to place the main emphasis on the
vast opportunities still open for rural
development. He said that less than
10 percent of land now being under
some form of rural tenure is at present
under sown grasses, improved pastures,
crops, or lying fallow. This speaks for
itself. So perhaps we should take it that
a L. east AMP, among the life
offices, could be keeping something up
its sleeve to give the more intensive
exploitation of rural resources another
push (as. it did in South Australia),
perhaps in Northern Australia, whose
possibilities for more beef production
Bell espoused.
From what he said, minerals men
n!* St fiueue up for institutional chaff
ike the other claimants. One consid^a-
tion (which would also apply to agri-
culture) was that mining was off the
beaten city tracks and couldn’t do ail
that much for the employment of a
rising population, which Bell regarded
as the critical factor in the whole
business of funds allocation. Employ-
ment must mostly be served on the
crescent of settlement along the south-
eastern seaboard, he said. The implica-
tion was that the institutions had to
put the bulk of their funds into sus-
taining and expanding activity in that
area and the infrastructure generally.
Obviously the institutions have the
devil’s own job to do the right thing
in all directions. Bell made it clear
that they don’t regard the setting up
of special development corporations,
or even the recently formed Austra-
lian Bankers’ Development Refinance
Association, of all that much assistance.
There are plenty of advantages, as we
know, and Bell retailed them. Against
them, the basic limitation to the effec-
tiveness of such corporations was the
shortage of available capital, which
this column has referred to before. For
the institutions it is largely a diversion
of finance that is involved. Hence the
primary objective should be to increase
the supply of available funds rather
than “mere diversion.” Bell gave the
impression that individual institutions
definitely prefer to make their own
investment choices and that possibly
this gives the better result. They are
experienced practitioners in the invest-
ment of funds; in any case their invest-
ment policies must be pretty strictly
geared to their liabilities.
Bell thinks the task of increasing
local savings above the present high
rate is a formidable one and presents a
challenge, so obviously he is not look-
ing all that optimistically at this avenue
for a solution of the problem of how
to swell the pool of funds to provide a
sufficiency of capital all round. He
didn’t say precisely that the most
realistic solution was to import more
capital, but he got pretty close to it.
For instance, he thinks the idea of
setting up a second quasi-official cor-
poration to mobilise funds, “especially
overseas funds,” to be “worth encourag-
ing,” and that Australian attitudes
toward overseas capital would improve
if more of the equity of overseas-
owned companies were in Australian
hands.
The latter would be assisted, he
suggested, by giving local lenders con-
version rights to the equity of over-
seas-owned companies who borrow fixed
capital here. This would cost the
Treasury something if interest on such
fixed-interest borrowings were again
made tax-allowable, but it would be
worth it. At any rate, as Bell put it,
“The emerging attitude of institutional
investors is that very often in a develop-
ment project loan financing carries
many of the risks but none of the
rewards attaching to the equity part
of the capital and that therefore there
should be participation at both levels.”
Another of his ideas was to encourage
joint enterprises in the manner India
and Japan are doing.
We’ve known for a long time that
the institutions have been angling for
a wider participation in the equity of
overseas-owned borrowing companies
through portfolio investment or other-
wise. On Bell’s own showing, in respect
of big new development companies
(particularly mining) in whose financ-
ing the institutions have lately become
involved, both the choice of such invest-
ments, and the follow-up role in polic-
ing them, have posed some nasty
problems which have strained their
investment techniques and machinery
for one thing. In the matter of choos-
ing such investments, what he called
their “lumpiness,” has defied or sorely
tested such techniques as cost-benefit
analysis. Another worry, possibly
echoing the H. G. Palmer affair, was
that policing big equity stakes seemed to
demand some participation in manage-
ment. As he put it, “while in normal
portfolio investment financial institu-
tions forebear to participate in manage-
ment or to seek to influence it .except
in circumstances where their interests
appear to be in jeopardy, they cannot
afford to be sleeping partners in
development propositions.”
Pleased though they may be to be
getting their investment claws deeper
into resources development, it is not
surprising the institutions are finding
it rather a mixed blessing. For quite
apart from their traditional investment
conservatism (dictated mainly by the
nature of their liabilities), their staffs
have been pushed into unfamiliar
ground and their old techniques have
been found a bit wanting. So we get
Dr. Bell making the following plea,
which seems most apposite generally
at this stage in the development race:
“Apart from the men who specialise
in their own comparatively narrow
technical fields, one of our greatest
needs is for men who can somehow
effect a marriage between the physical
sciences and economics and finance.
Occasionally we strike some cross-
fertilisation of the disciplines such as
in agricultural economics or economic
geology, but there is an even wider
need for physical scientists and
engineers who can translate their
physical observations into commercial
terms, with proper appreciation of the
ultimate responsibilities of boards of
directors in assessing the financial
viability of projects. Or, approach-
ing it the other way round, perhaps
we need more accountants or invest-
ment analysts with some training
in the physical sciences so that they can
the more meaningfully convert physical
estimates into financial ones.”

MINING • SHARE • LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON in Sydney
THE WESTERN MINING ripple
spreads very widely indeed across the
local investment pond; people are buy-
ing shares in Sydney chemist Washin-
ton H. Soul Pattinson, for example,
because of the 165,000 shares it holds
in Western Mining that have doubled
in value this year to about $1.9 million
(or about 90 cents a W. H. Soul share
which now sells around the $4.80
mark). Finding companies with Wes-
tern Mining in their investment port-
folios is the latest analysts’ parlor
game.
And there are those who see far
greater heights yet for Western Mining
shares; Moir’s Australian Invest-
ments, for instance, considers they
are well below their right price
at only a little over $ll. It
takes the view that the best gains
are to come in this stock over the
next few years and that recent hesitancy
in the market represented “sucker sell-
ing.”
There is no doubt that the 315,761
Western Mining shares held by Barrier
miner and investor North Broken Hill
give its porfolio an added significance
($3.4 million worth of shares is signi-
cant even to North BH). North Broken
Hill’s portfolio has benefited from other
rises, too, and is interesting for such
multi-million reasons as the $4 million
worth of BHP shares in it, the $1.2
million worth of BH Souths, the $5.2
million worth of EZs, $1 million of
ICIANZs, s3| million of Associated
Pulp and 3 million $2 shares in Alcoa
of Australia, apart from heavy invest-
ments in BHAS, ER & S, Metal Manu-
factures, New BH and Rio Tinto Zinc
Corporation.
Last June, the portfolio had a book
value of $35.6 million and a market
value of $3B million, or more than $2
per North BH share (which excludes
the latest huge rises in Western Mining
and BHP, for example, and does not
put any real market value on the un-
listed holdings). Investment income
now makes up about 15 cents of the
25 cents per share North BH pays in
dividends and this income is certain to
increase substantially in future years,
not only from new ventures like Wes-
tern Mining’s nickel, Alcoa’s alumin-
ium, which is expected to make its
first profit this year, and from BHP
when it gets the benefits of its oil and
gas, but also from the normal growth
of its other holdings.
The current downturn in the base
metal stocks (nickel excepted!) that
has lowered North Broken Hill’s share
price from $4.40 to levels around $4,
seems largely due to last month’s dis-
mal news from BH South of a reduced
interim dividend and a sharp fall in
earnings that has rubbed off on North
BH for no good reason; true, North’s
nine months’ mining surplus has fallen
from $7.6 million to $5 million as sales
dropped $2.2 million to $13.5 million
under pressure of lower (and still
weakening) lead-zinc prices.
But its earnings will be enough to
keep its 25 cents dividend (which yields
6.2 percent at current prices) intact,
barring disasters. This year’s earnings
have been forecast by one Sydney
broker at around the 35 percent mark,
which is adequate cover. North BH is
one of the safest anti-cyclical stocks in
the business; the shares could ease back
a little yet, but anything below $4 is
good value for this stock.
THE NEWS OF “sharply improved”
results from Austarama Television,
Melbourne’s Channel 0, that have
brought the company almost to a break-
even footing (it lost only $12,864 in
the latest half-year against a loss of
$387,376 in the same period last year)
is significant not only for the Ansett
group. The results also add strength
to reports in Sydney that United Tele-
casters, the Channel 10 operator that
joins with Austarama in the Indepen-
dent Television Network, has at last
turned the corner, too.
Last month, United Telecasters re-
ported a substantial but smaller loss
for the December half-year and added
that in March it had earned its first-
ever profit. It will still end up*
with a heavy loss for the year but
nothing like last year’s $1.76 million.
The company’s high capitalisation
limits its appeal, but there should be a
useful recovery in the stpre price over
the next couple of years.
THERE ARE implications for many
W.A. stocks in the point that Speculator
makes on page 56 about W.A. share-
holders trimming many of their in-
dustrial portfolios to find the cash to
take up as many Elamersley Holdings
shares as they can get (and allocations
per head in W.A. were far higher than
elsewhere as a good PR gesture to the
West). Speculator took advantage of
this situation to buy Chamberlain.
But there are plenty of other good
quality W.A. stocks that also look a
little heavy. Swan Brewery, an excellent
growth prospect (despite the hoo-ha
about possible competition from the
Courage group after they get their
Victorian operations off the ground),
has its shares down near its year’s low
of $2.27, Bowra at 96 cents is only 3
cents above, Peters WA has slumped
under pressure of the war in ice-cream
and frozen foods from $1.73 to $1.17,
and Bell Bros (whose operations should
be booming) is at its year’s low of $1.37
after being up at $1.62 a few months
ago.
The Chartist says:
BHP was first recommended in the issue of June 18, 1966, when prices were around
the $5.90 level. At that time it appeared to be establishing a new uptrend after
the break in the downward trend, which could possibly be described as a pause
in the long-term uptrend. Since then, prices have been as high as $7.20; although
some short-term reaction might be expected, it is quite likely that BHP will
eventually rise to a target close to $lO.BO and this could well happen toward the
end of 1968. The stock appears to be moving in a trend at a rate of 35 percent
appreciation per annum. Last sale on 2/5/67 —$6.96.

Behind the balance sheets
Takeover confers merit on
Auto Totalisators
OF COURSE IT’S a rough deal for
shareholders in Automatic Totalisators
(U.S.A.) Ltd., but the takeover offer
worth only 87 cents a $2 share from
its Australian sponsor company has
added a great deal to the investment
merit of the local Automatic Totalisator
company. For a cost in capital terms
of only $150,000 in ordinary shares
(lifting capital to $1.4 million) and
$150,000 in cash, the Australian com-
pany is collecting the outstanding 71
percent of the U.S.A. company, whose
profits last year were (an admittedly
exceptional) $231,000.
To make this deal pay off, the Aus-
tralian company needs only $60,000
profit from the U.S.A. company on
the extra capital it has issued for this
takeover to keep pace with last year’s
local earning rate. The indications are
that it will do very much better than
that, for the local company’s accounts
have not taken in anything from the
U.S.A. company in the past; consolidat-
ing them now will have a staggering
impact on group earnings. If the U.S.A.
company were to earn only half last
year’s profit (which seems a minimum),
this would represent on its own an earn-
ing rate of about 8 percent on the
capital of the whole group.
As one of the U.S.A. company’s
major assets was an entitlement to a
licence fee on all equipment sold by
Automatic Totalisators in the U.S., the
takeover offer removes the need for
this payment to go outside the con-
solidated accounts; this too should have
a significant impact on profits. For
this licence fee is believed to be sub-
stantial and appeared to provide a
large part of the $558,766 trading pro-
fit earned by the company on the $3.8
million equipment installation to the
New York racing tracks last year. It
would remove some overseas taxation
problems if this licence fee arrange-
ment were revoked after the takeover.
And any switch of this kind that
reduced the tax liability of the group
will clearly be a benefit (and in this
case a substantial one if present tax
relief applications fail) to the overall
profit. Last year, $84,178 was paid by
the U.S.A. company in U.S. taxes. Some
relief should eventually be obtained un-
der the Australian-American double tax
agreement, but American withholding
tax of 30 percent on the interest charged
to Automatic Totalisators (U.S.A.) and
Australian tax of percent had to
be provided for in 1966.
To some extent, the local company
needs to take in the U.S.A. one. Before
the takeover was announced directors
had forecast that the current year for
Auto Totes would not be “anywhere
near as profitable” as last year when
earnings hit 40 percent on capital,
although it would still be “satisfactory.”
For this is a business of feast and
famine, and last year was a feast. It
was a far greater feast than the follow-
ing table suggests for, despite the pro-
fit fall for the year (after making ad-
justments to provisions written back),
in reality the Australian company
earned a great deal more than in the
previous year. Its trading surplus more
than doubled and it was only the de-
duction of a “possible” contract price
adjustment of $300,000 that brought
the net profit down to $452,000, a little
below last year’s. It is significant that
the Tax Commissioner did not agree
that this was a taxable deduction (he
charged $630,000 tax) and it would
be no surprise to see this provision
written back into the accounts when
the work is completed on the U.S. con-
tracts in question, probably in the cur-
rent year, so that 1965-66’s real earn-
ing rate would then become about 70
percent.
So last year’s conservative earning
rate of 40.1 percent may not be hard to
maintain this year after the takeover,
despite the fact that it was a highly
exceptional year owing to profits from
the huge installation by Automatic
Totalisators (U.S.A.) Ltd., in which
the Australian company has a majority
of voting power and a majority on the
board, but only a 29 percent share-
holding. The 600,000 ordinary shares
not held are now being taken over in
a one-for-two plus 50c cash deal. One
of the few things that can be said in
favor of this deal for shareholders in
the U.S.A. company is that it will pro-
vide them with dividend income from
next April for the first time since the
company was floated in 1951. Other-
wise, they had to wait until the
accumulated losses of $303,000, even
after 1966’s exceptional profit of
$345,000, were extinguished before get-
ting any payment.
Profit figures presented in the
accompanying table have been
adjusted retrospectively for excess tax
provisions.
The U.S.A. company’s accumulated
losses will not provide any tax bene-
fits. The tax losses have been lost by
the passage of time, for in the U.S.
benefits are only available for three
years back and four years forward.
At June 30, 1966, the Australian
company owed the U.S. company
$277,000, but this amount has since
been paid. The normal position was
for the U.S. company to be indebted to
the Australian. Money will now be com-
ing into Australia from the U.S. com-
pany, and the local operation should
not have any trouble in finding the
$150,000 cash to fulfil the cash part of
the takeover deal. It seems to have
had the takeover in mind as far back
as June 30 last when it had $150,000 out
at call, as well as $434,000 in over-
seas banks.
The New York contract to supply
automatic totalisator equipment to the
New York Racing Association’s tracks
at Aqueduct, Saratoga, and Belmont
Park was far bigger than the only size-
able recent contract in Australia (that
to Flemington, Caulfield, Moonee Val-
ley, and Sandown). The equipment
in New York handled $660 million last
year on 234 race days. The $3,850,000
performance bond will not expire until
the equipment has operated at Belmont
Park, but it is only a technicality now.
Service fees will be earned by the U.S.
company over an eight-year period.
To compete on a leasing basis, Auto
Totes would require a much greater
capital than it now has the Ameri-
can contract, for instance, was almost
double its shareholders’ funds. Equip-
ment in Australia and New Zealand is
sometimes sold, sometimes leased. In
New Zealand the main competitor,
Bell Punch, was taken over in January,
1965. Almost all N.Z. tracks have
automatic totalisator equipment and
these do big business because there are
no bookmakers in N.Z.
The proliferation of TAB facilities
in Australia has improved Auto Totes’
sales because the VRC, for instance,
had the cash to buy new equipment for
the courses. Although fewer people are
going to the tracks, their investment has
been greater and the turnovers, on
which Auto Totes’ revenue is based,
have actually increased.

Directors have made it plain that
they believe in bonus dividends in the
buoyant years. So while the 6.0 per-
cent yield now showing from last year’s
15 percent dividend may not be guar-
anteed, as it included a 3 percent bonus
element, it seems likely to remain. And
management says it can at least main-
tain the 12 percent dividend which it
now regards as basic; on this rate the
current yield would be 4.8 percent.
But the main thing is the 16 percent
earnings yield; that represents real
value.
It seems absurd for the market to
have marked the local company’s
shares down so sharply from $1.41 to
what seems an “arranged” price of
$1.25 since the takeover was announced,
for not only will it mean a huge
addition to local profits, but in market
terms it seems likely that the takeover
will not result in any large increase
in the supply of available shares in
the company that might come on the
market; holders of the U.S.A. shares
seem likely to continue as holders of
the local one.

Down but not out
Remember Minster
By PELIAS in Melbourne
IN THE STOCKMARKET, nobody
loves you when you are down, even
though you may be far from out. So
there is often money to be made in the
out-of-favor stocks whose prices are
far lower than they deserve to be simply
because they are out of favor.
It is hard to resist Minster shares
while they remain at the current low of
between $2 and $2.10 and yield a pheno-
menal percent from dividends. Ad-
mittedly the group seems certain to earn
lower profits this year, but unless there
is a drastic drop in last year’s 34.2 per-
cent earning rate directors seem unlikely
to reduce the 20 percent dividend. It
has been held for eight years in a row
Financially, the group is very strong.
It has absolutely no loan commitments,
there are $5.50 of current assets for
every $2 of current liabilities, reserves
of $4.8 million to back the $4.4 million
paid capital, and, by coincidence, net
tangible asset backing for each $1 share

The hat says it! You're a man who thinks young, dares
to be different whatever your years. The name of the
hat is ‘SAXON’—a dual personality Stetson you can
wear with ease to the yacht club or a shareholders’
meeting. Note the stitched crown (others will)—just
one of the many points of flattering difference that
distinguishes this great new Stetson. At all leading
menswear stores.

is $2.10 —the same as the current mar-
ket price. The group’s management team
is top class, as are its products and the
board displays an extremely responsible
as well as generous attitude to share-
holders; this is evidenced by the divi-
dend and issue history of past years and
its regular and supplementary reports
to the Stock Exchange.
Another attraction is the fact that
the market price seems unlikely to go
any lower. Both the high yield and
the asset backing must surely underpin
the price at about $2 (which aiso
appears to have taken into account the
likelihood of a dividend cut so that
if the 20 percent distribution is main-
tained this year, market prices should
respond with a rise). The shares were
fetching more than $lO each in 1964
and 1965, when the group’s growth was
at galloping pace and its market status
at a peak. These levels were as ridicu-
lously high as the current level may be
ridiculously low, since the'market over-
states the impact of tufted carpets on
Westminster.
Not that the shares provide scope
for great capital growth—for the time
being the company has had its run.
It is now settling down to fight the
increased competition which its stagger-
ing success helped to attract. Although
many changes have come to the carpet
market over the past three years,
Minster still retains a big slice and has
launched a program which will protect
this in the future. From 1967-68 the
group’s profits should start to rise again,
or at least cease falling.
The reduced demand for West-
minster carpets that brought lower pro-
fits in the six months to December 31
is believed to have shown an upturn
in the current half, probably as a result
of a heavy advertising campaign which
started last year when the company
changed the fibre-blend in its product.
Another source of extra profits in the
current six months will be the in-
crease in wholesale prices last Febru-
ary, most of which has apparently been
absorbed by retailers and so should have
very little effect on sales. The group
has also launched a new commercial
line known as “Churinga.” It is similar
to the traditional product but heavier
and longer wearing. It is not retailed
but marketed under contract to office
buildings, shops, etc. The rapid rate
of construction in these fields of late
should have won Minster a lot of extra
profits.
ANOTHER STOCK for which the
market appears to be predicting a divi-
dend cut sooner or later is Felt and
Textiles. The 50 cent units can cur-
rently be bought for 48 cents to yield
more than 10 percent from the 10 per-
cent dividend. In Felt’s case, the

To date, K engines, including the K-major, have
developed more than two million h.p. and secured over
SA77 million business, 67 per cent, of it abroad.
Hawker Siddeley know how.
Hawker Siddeley design and build diesels. Big, rugged
ones from Mirrlees—like the thousandth K-type illustra-
ted. Medium-range ones from Blackstone. Small, compact
ones from Petters and Listers. Diesels with a power span
of 1.5 b.h.p. to 8,500 b.h.p. Diesels that generate horse-
power throughout the world.
K-type diesels are versatile and economical. They power
equipment from trawlers to ferries, power stations to
factories. They are the sole means of electricity generation
in many areas, putting horsepower to work in 150 countries.
But Hawker Siddeley don’t stop at diesels. You find
their products almost everywhere. They go down on
the farm—haul trains—steer and power ships—probe
space—build and equip power stations —roll roads —store
heat —fly people—transform electricity —pack food—fuel
aircraft—and maintain a daily turnover of more than $A2|

Diesel engines are part of this turnover, but only part.
That’s what makes Hawker Siddeley a world-size in-

No wonder he’s the family favourite. Clean warm
air circulating in every room throughout the
coldest periods of the year. No huddling around
ineffective one-room heaters!
No frigid early morning toes! Instead, the won-
derful feeling of being able to wear summertime
clothes throughout your home every day of the
year—and with simple, finger-tip control!
Low fuel costs, too, and all fully automatic,
even the economical oil burner—that’s what
Gilbarco Central “Whole House” Heating means
in the successful man’s home. You can get all
this for little more than the cost of heating
two or three rooms with “huddle-over” heating!
Two systems from which to choose: The popular
Hot Water Central Heating system incorporating
The Potterton Boiler unit, which supplies
throughout-the-home heat with a complete hot
water service: or a fully ducted warm air system
in which air is fan-circulated from a Gilbarco
Warm Air Furnace.
Both heating units are compact enough to place
in the garage, laundry, basement or even under
the house.

your city—who will advise you your nearest
Gilbarco Dealer —located in all cities and major
country towns.

chances of a dividend cut this year are
less likely than Minster’s, although the
longer-term dividend position is at
least open to question in view of the
state of the New Zealand economy,
where such a large proportion of its
profit is earned. Nevertheless, once the
group confirms a 10 percent dividend
rate for 1966-67 as seems most likely,
and the expected higher profits for the
year are announced, the price should
recover to a bit above par.
The 1965-66 earning rate of 11.3
percent did not provide much dividend
cover, but the $350,000 retrospective
payroll tax rebates the company is to
include in its second-half profits and
the improved earnings in the first half
both indicate an improved result in
the current year. The group’s financial
slate is not as clean as Minster’s, but
it has plenty of working capital and its
maturing loan commitments are nicely
spread over the next few years and
could probably be met from cash flow.
The $1.12 stated asset backing for each
share is probably closer to $2 or four
times current market price for the
scrip.
But until there is a clear indication
that NZ profits (which provided half
the group’s net last year) are not in
real danger, the market should exer-
cise some caution with this stock, even
though things seem to be improving
a bit in Australia.
STOKES, manufacturer of a wide range
of metal products, may see a rise in
price soon, and certainly so by the
time the annual result is released in
August. The group has been perform-
ing at a better rate this year after the
1965-66 setback, but the $1 shares are
drifting close to par at $1.03. There
are good prospects for capital growth
but, in the meantime, the yield from
dividends is a healthy 7.8 percent.
Last year’s steady eight percent
dividend was covered by 11.1 percent
earnings on capital. This was well
down on the previous 16.2 percent,
mainly because of the increased capital
to be serviced following a placement
to finance new projects at the Ringwood
factory. These new projects did not
add to 1965-66 profits; they should do
so in the current year.
Both sales and profit were higher in
the December six months and it is
believed that the trend has continued
up to the present date. While the
group may not have such large benefits
from investment allowances this year,
there seems little doubt that profit will
put on a decent increase and a dividend
of at least eight percent will be paid.
An improvement in earning rate will
leave plenty of room for a small lift in
the payout if directors so desire. The
market seems a little harsh on the
scrip in leaving the price so close to
par.

Mining
New life for the defunct
IN A MANNER befitting its past his-
tory of booms, Australian share markets
in the past few weeks have shown in
miniature that they are still capable of
paying a high price for mining com-
panies without mines. While Western
Mining led the nickel boom (for very
substantial reasons), Great Boulder,
which has not yet begun drilling on
leases it does not even own, climbed
to $1.32. On the strength of Great
Boulder’s plans to prospect on its pro-
perty, Hampton Properties (listed in
London) itself went to $1.20, while
Hampton Gold Mining Areas (listed
in London and Adelaide) reached
$1.53. The rises in these shares had
rather more justification, as Hampton
Areas has property adjacent to the
leases held by Western Mining, and
WMC is to drill these areas for nickel;
should this exploration be successful,
Hampton Areas will receive some
worthwhile benefits.
Another leaseholder in the area,
Metals Exploration NL which has a
lease some 20 miles west of Kambalda,
s< tred from 30 cents to $1.25, but this
r; ,e was perhaps due more to the fact
that drilling has begun on its large
nickel prospect at Greenvale, west of
Townsville in Queensland.
In the search for other opportunities
to share in the nickel boom, even
Great Western has climbed from 1
cent earlier this year to 30 cents; this
rise was, it seems, pure “nickelmania,”
as the company has no apparent interest
in any prospective nickel deposits. It
has been losing money for some years,
and Western Mining, which has been
managing the company (it owns 14
percent of the capital), has lent it $2.8
million over the past years in an unsuc-
cessful effort to make it pay. It was
not long before these facts were
realised.
The Golden Mile really started to
come into its own again when Kal-
goorlie Southern Gold Mines NL ran
up to 65 cents. Kalgoorlie Southern,
at first appearance, does not appear
to have any stake in Western Mining’s
nickel, being formed to test areas south
of Kalgoorlie for a repetition at depth
of the ore body, which supported the
original gold boom at Kalgoorlie. The
testing of this ore body is being carried
out by Newmont Mining Corporation,
of the U.S.A., and the Consolidated
Mines Selection Company Limited (of
the U.K.), who are earning a 50 per.
cent interest by drilling two deep holes,
It is difficult to see any connection
between Kalgoorlie Southern and
Western Mining’s nickel, except that
Mr. Lindesay Clark is chairman of
both companies.
The resurrection, however brief, of
companies like Great Western is an
illustration that the structure of appar-
ently defunct companies can have a
value sometimes out of all proportion
to their assets and leases. And there
are still quite a number of companies
in this category.
One of the more recent examples of
such a speculation would be Uranium
Consolidated NL. This company was
formed in 1954 and spent the next 11
years in unsuccessful exploration; in
1966, after an interest in the company
was taken up by Mr. D. C. Tennent, a
consulting mining engineer, leases were
acquired over areas in Queensland
which contained bentonite, a clay used
in the pelletising of iron ore. With a
paid-up capital of $128,000, this de-
velopment improved the company’s
prospects enormously; Uranium Con-
solidated shares rose from below 9
cents to a high point of 79 cents in
1966, and have remained above 40
cents since that time.
The uranium boom also gave birth
to Uranium Holdings NL, which
rapidly abandoned the search for
uranium and began to look for beach-
sand deposits. It subsequently pur-
chased a rutile lease at Tewantin, in
Queensland, but was put out of busi-
ness when the rutile market collapsed
in 1957 (it has recovered strongly
since then, of course). In 1966
735,400 forfeited shares were issued to
Canadian mining interests. With the
injection of these additional funds,
Uranium Holdings shares have risen
from prices around 5 cents in 1965
to over 30 cents in recent months.
The advantage of an existing cor-
porate structure for a new running
enterprise is that it provides a ready-
made list of shareholders, which facili-
tates the raising of additional capital;
it also provides a negotiable asset in
exchange for a leaseholder’s interest in
a promising deposit.
Pine Vale Mines Limited (listed
in Brisbane) has a paid-up capital of
only $129,000, and its shares were
recently quoted at 5 cents buyer. The
company mined and treated ore on a
limited scale near Mackay, Queensland,
for a few months prior to September,
1957, when operations were suspended
due to poor recovery rates. To date
the company has been unsuccessful in
its efforts to obtain additional capital
for the purchase of necessary plant
extensions.
Austral Mining Company NL, an
Adelaide-based company, is another un-
successful mining company, which
appears to have a few assets in the
form of shares in industrial and mining
companies. Paid capital is $48,000,

against assets worth about $20,000 (in
1965) and the current market for the
shares is 6 cents buyer, 9 cents seller,
against a high price of 5 cents in the
seven years ending 1965. The small
capitalisation of this company could
well make it an attractive vehicle for
some new venture.
There are other companies in
addition to the ones mentioned above
the list is quite long, in fact —and,
although some of them will no doubt
remain in their present state for many
years, the heightened activity in mineral
exploration suggests that it may be
opportune to check the contents of that
old safe-custody box.
Commodities
Doubts on lead-zinc
Mr. VAL DUNCAN, head of Rio
Tinto-Zinc Coporation, has expressed
some concern at the future for lead
markets in the next three years or so.
As pointed out last week, the short-
term outlook does not seem as good
as Mr. Baer, chairman of New Broken
Hill Consolidated, felt it to be when he
said recently that the worst may be
over for Western nations’ economies,
and that as a result the future of the
lead market was viewed with “a
measure of confidence.” (Mr. Duncan’s
RTZ owns 85 percent of local Conzinc
Riotinto, which in turn owns 32 per-
cent of New Broken Hill.)
“Profits from lead operations are
reasonably assured for the next two
years,” said Mr. Duncan. “But in two
years’ time there will be big production
developments in the lead belt of the
Missouri. When these come on stream
it could affect the market.”
Lead at present is in a stronger
statistical position than zinc, although
the latter is supported by producers at
£stg.lo2 a ton against the free market
quote of £B2 for lead. Weakness in
LME zinc prices lately has revived
speculation on a further cut in the zinc
producers’ quote, but Mr. Duncan said,
“I do not foresee any change in the
zinc producer price in the near future.”
RTZ was one of the main forces in
the creation of this producer price, in
mid-1964.
In this context, Mr. Duncan’s com-
ments on proposals for another copper
producer price set-up are rather
unexpected. He did not feel that such
a move would be a practical possibility
for some time to come. In view of
the problems met in the past, he
doubted that another attempt would be
made. Mr. Duncan added that he did
not feel a copper producer price was
desirable.

SPECULATOR’S
DIARY
Bargains around
from the
Western shuffle
“GO WEST, YOUNG MAN” is cur-
rently good advice in my books. Over
the past few weeks it has become
increasingly noticeable that Perth-based
stocks are yielding higher and selling
for much less than is usual. Bargains
in all departments seem to be the order
of the day. The catch? None!
What is happening is that the
Western Australians are all lining up
to make some quick profits out of their
own State by getting in on the new
Hamersley float. Unlike the rest of
Australia, where only a selected few
brokers have the stock available, all
Perth brokers have been allocated
parcels. The result is that the West-
side investors, who are traditional
holders of their local stocks, are all
selling as much stock as need be to
put the maximum number of eggs in
their Hamersley baskets. Hence the
bargains.
Having not been able to get in on
Hamersley, I decided the next best
thing was to come in on the shuffle,
that is, to buy in at the currently de-
pressed prices and then sell out when
the stags come back to buy their old
favorites again. By that time prices
should be picking up, along with
demand. That’s the theory, anyway!
The stock I chose for this opera-
tion is Chamberlain Holdings, the
tractor makers. This firm has done
well ever since listing in early 1963.
Last year was naturally a difficult one
because of the drought in the eastern
States, but even so sales only dipped
by 10 percent. I must add, however,
that the day was saved to some degree
by an A 1 season in Western Australia
and by some new export markets being
opened up in the East. Nevertheless,
its performance was a creditable one
for a company so dependent on the
man on the land. So far this year
profits are reported as being OK. On
this basis the shares look appealing at
$1.67, and even doubly so when you
consider the price was $1.83 earlier in
the year.
While talking of individual State
stocks, I notice that John Martin, the
century-old department store in Adel-
aide, is selling for only $l.OO. This is
the lowest ebb I can ever remember
the stock reaching over the past five
years, or even longer. The price is
most inconsistent with the company's
interim report. In the latest six months
profits were up 11 percent and the
interim dividend was raised from 4 to
5 percent. Coupling this news with
the pick-up in consumer spending and
the good repo.rts from other retailers
around Australia, I decided I couldn’t
go too far wrong here. I bought 300.
On the subject of shops, I noticed
that, from last month, the newspaper
shops were charging more for women’s
magazines. Both the “Women’s
Weekly” and the “Woman’s Day” have
gone up from 10 to 15 cents a copy.
“Women’s Weekly” sells around
copies a week, which means
that the additional 5 cents will add
approximately $2 million a year to the
revenue coffers of Consolidated Press.
John Fairfax, which publishes
“Woman’s Day” at the rate of over
half a million a week, will not be very
far behind. These are two stocks I’ll
be keeping an eye on from now on—
especially around final report time.
I made only one sale this week. It
was Bowling Centres. These shares
were sold when they reached 12
cents, which seems to me to be a
more realistic price than the 8 cents
at which I bought them. My brief
but happy association with this stock
yielded me $4OO before brokerage.
Transactions for the week were:
BOUGHT
200 Chamberlain $1.67 $341
300 John Martin $l.OO $306
SOLD
10,000 Bowling Centres $0.12 $1176

Security analysis
CSR—earnings per share
will be down
THERE ARE FOURTEEN main
industry groups in the Sydney Share
Price Index and, in numerical order,
the group after the retailers is No. 6
food, drink, and tobacco. There are
five of the “Melbourne Leaders” in-
cluded in this category and they are:
Colonial Sugar Refining Co. Ltd.,
Henry Jones (IXL) Ltd., Carlton and
United Breweries Ltd., Tooth and Com-
pany Ltd., and British Tobacco Co.
(Australia) Ltd. As at the time of
writing this article, they are priced as
follows:
Dividend
Last Sale Yield %
CSR $3.23 3.9
Henry Jones 3.45 3.5
CUB “Z” 3.30 3.9
Tooth 5.02 3.2
British Tobacco 2.56 4.7
All are priced to show dividend
yields below 4 percent with the excep-
tion of British Tobacco. This suggests
that investors regard the prospects for
sugar, jam, and beer rather better than
those for cigarettes.
In this article, Colonial Sugar Refin-
ing Company Ltd. will be examined
and it is fair to say that the price of
this company’s shares has risen quite
dramatically in recent times. After
hovering between $2.80 and $2.90 for
some considerable time, the shares
reached a peak of $3.46 a day or so
ago, but have since reacted to $3.23.
The 20 percent rise took place almost
without interruption; it will now be
interesting to see whether the rise is
permanent or whether the price will
now drift back to the old level of
around $2.90.
It is always difficult to say just what
factors caused a price rise. It certainly
does seem as though this rise was
brought about by the announcement
that the Mount Newman iron ore pro-
ject agreements had been signed.
However, it is also a fact that the
free world price of sugar has improved
quite considerably in recent weeks;
certainly this is likely to have a far
more beneficial effect on CSR’s profits
than the Mount Newman “joint
venture.”
CSR operates seven sugar mills —
three in New South Wales and four in
Queensland. In this particular activity,
it is just like any other miller and
subject to the same advantages and
disadvantages. It seems to have
obtained quite good increases in the
mill peaks” for its Queensland mills
last year and the three New South
Wales mills will share in the increase.
Mill peaks” represent the amount of
sugar which the mill can contribute to
the No. 1 Pool. This is the pool which
gets the good price for its sugar, since
it goes, for home consumption, to the
U.K. under the British Commonwealth
Sugar Agreement and to the U.S.A.
under preferential terms. All these
sales are made at negotiated prices
substantially above the free world price.
It is only the sugar which makes up the
No. 2 pool which is sold at this low
price.
In addition to sugar milling, CSR
also refines and markets sugar. For
these activities, it receives a fee which
has increased from just under $l3 mil-
lion in 1962-63 to $14.5 million in
1965-66, despite the downward trend
in the world sugar price. However,
there seems to be little doubt that
when CSR announces its consolidated
profit for the year to March 31, 1967,
it will be lower than the figure for the
year to March 31, 1966, and this will
be in accordance with the predictions
which have been made by the company
in the past 12 months. The company’s
statistical record is:

The most attractive statistic is the
trend in dividends per share, and it is
worth reporting that CSR has an un-
broken dividend record since 1888!
Although the Mount Newman pro-
ject attracts all the limelight, it looks
as though the CSR building materials
division is the next most important
profit-earner after sugar. Recently, a
joint marketing arrangement was
announced between CSR and Asso-
ciated Pulp and Paper for the market-
ing of hardboard, but it seems likely
that CSR supplies up to 75 percent of
Australia’s requirements in this area.
In association with Australian Paper
Manufacturers, CSR is engaged in the
production of particle board; it seems
that there has been dramatic growth in
the demand for this product.
In addition, the company makes the
largest range of vinyl floor tiles and is
involved, through its substantial hold-
ing in Bradford Insulation, in insula-
tion materials. Its other well-known
investment is in Ready Mixed Concrete
and recently it acquired quite a worth-
while interest in Farley and Lewers
through the sale of part of one of its
own interests in a gravel deposit.
Other investments include sizable
holdings in Fletcher Holdings, of New
Zealand, Planet Oil, United Telecasters,
and Fiji Industries (a company manu-
facturing cement in Fiji).
Just as the interest in building board
sprang out of CSR’s sugar activities—
the first building board was “Cane-ite,”
made from the bagasse from sugarcane
—the moves to chemicals grew out of
the company’s interest in alcohol pro-
duced from sugar. In this field, CSR
has some very well-known associates in
Dow Chemical and The Distillers Com-
pany, yet it is difficult to believe that
this particular division has been a major
contributor to group profit.
The other interests in bauxite and
iron ore seem to be more accidental
and there is no way that one can point
to a logical development to this form
of activity. In fact, there are some
who say that CSR has not shown much
expertise in the iron ore venture. As
yet there is no information on how the
bauxite venture is progressing. Esti-
mating the profit from iron ore ven-
tures is the current local sport for
security analysts; it is likely because
of the lack of historical evidence that
they will all prove to be quite wide of
the mark. So far as can be judged at
the present point of time, it is possible
that the annual average profit accruing
to CSR will be between $3 million and
$6 million.
This year a further fall in earnings
per share must be expected, for not
only will the returns from sugar milling
be down but it is likely that the returns
from building board will also be lower.
Nevertheless, CSR has substantial
interests in growth areas, even if its
main line of business is being affected
with increasing force by the world
price of sugar. Profits are therefore as
vulnerable as those of any other com-
pany which depends on world com-
modity prices.
In 1964 a well-known and highly
regarded analyst suggested that CSR.
was “substantially undervalued” be-
cause it was selling at 13 times esti-
mated 1964 earnings. His earnings
estimate was most accurate, but it is
clear that today investors are looking
for a lower price/earnings multiple.
At $3.23, the price/earnings multiple
is 14.5 on the basis of 1965-66 earn-
ings (and 1966-67 earnings per share
will not be much lower); at $2.90 the
multiple is 13 just as it was in 1964.
With the iron ore project and the
growing interest in building materials,
one can see earnings per share increas-
ing to about 30 cents per share within
the next five years or so, even without
any major change in sugar prices. This
does not represent a very high rate of
growth but perhaps it is as much as
can be expected from a large diversified
group.

SHARE YIELDS I
A reinvigorated mining section certainly didn’t demand much
special support from Western Mining Corporation (up another
75 cents to $11.75), but BHP had to give a fair amount of
sustenance to industrials; in the event, Hills gained 10 cents
to close at $7.05. Henry Jones found no favor, shedding 25
cents to reach $3.20, while ICI went down 13 cents to $1.77,
Millaquin led the sugars by rising 11 cents to $2.65; CSR
managed a 2 cent lift. CIG slipped a further 5 cents to $2.15,
Mount Isa, not unnaturally, lost 15 cents, finishing at $3.60,
Among N the upturns, CRA, at $6.20, moved 40 cents.

When it’s shivering cold and your office becomes an
igloo, your factory little Antarctica, your
staff slows down. That’s bad. Bad for production
and bad for profits. What to do? Insulate with
SISALATION heat-reflecting aluminium
foil insulation.
Inexpensive Sisalation keeps winter out and slashes

Ructions over the Meat Board
By the RURAL EDITOR
A STRONG MOVE is afoot in Vic-
toria, South Australia, and Tasmania
to have the Australian Meat Board
reconstituted. The reason is that not
one of these three States has any pro-
ducer representative on the board,
which is heavily loaded in favor of
N.S.W. and Queensland.
The meat production of Victoria
alone appears to warrant inclusion of
a southern representative. Meat Board
figures show that, in 1966, Victoria was
the leading producer with 515,000 tons
of sheep, cattle, and pig meat. N.S.W.
followed with 469,000 tons and then
came Queensland with 382,000 tons.
Queensland can claim to have more
beef cattle than any other State, but
southern cattlemen say this hides the
true picture. Many cattle classified as
dairy cattle in southern States actually
go into beef production. The total pro-
duction in tons, listed above, gives the
true picture.
The Australian Meat Board consists
of the following: chairman, Mr. J. L.
Shute (appointed by the Minister for
Primary Industry); Commonwealth
Government representative, Mr. F. N.
Giles; exporter s’ representatives,
Messrs. J. S. Balderstone and P. J.
Anderson; producers’ representatives,
Messrs. R. Langfield and P. D. A.
Wright (N.S.W.), A. J. Allingham and
B. H. Hughes (Queensland), F. J.
Horwood (Western Australia).
Victorian critics of the Meat Board
claim that the Board’s activities are
slanted to beef production in general,
and northern beef production in par-
ticular. They allege that lamb gets
little attention. This, however, does
not absolve southern lamb producers
from paying their slaughter levy which,
with the beef slaughter levy, finances
the operations of the Meat Board. Too
much money, say the critics, goes to
financing research into beef produc-
tion in the north.
What the southern critics have failed
to do, so far, is to come up with hard
and fast facts and figures. This they
are endeavoring to do.
According to a member of a Vic-
torian APPU delegation to Canberra
recently, the Minister for Primary
Industry, Mr. Adermann, also a
Queenslander, has adopted the view
that southern interests have no argu-
ment because most of the beef comes
from Queensland. Mr. A. B. Wood,
of Geelong, chairman of the meat pro-
duce section of the APPU, said at the
annual meeting of that body: “We
came away from Canberra convinced
that here was a Minister quite disin-
terested in our case.” Mr. Wood con-
tinued: “It is an iniquity and an
absurdity that Victorian meat pro-
ducers have no representative on the
Meat Board chairman J. L. Shute.
Meat Board.” He said that N.S.W. and
Queensland interests were “working to
keep Victorian producers off the
Board.”
In fairness, the APPU meat section
did not stress that it should supply the
representative, although, obviously, it
would like to provide the representa-
tive. In deciding to make this a
straight-out political campaign, the
APPU meat section decided that the
emphasis should be on getting a Vic-
torian representative.
The method to be adopted is not new
in farming, but it is nevertheless inter-
esting to see it formulated in an open
meeting. Every local member in farm-
ing areas will be approached and asked
to support the campaign for a Vic-
torian representative on the Board.
There is a lot more to this than
mere farmer ambition and party
politics. Every Australian consumer
of meat is involved, but may not know
it. The Meat Board policies, to date
and with good reason probably, have
encouraged development of the Ameri-
can boneless beef trade. Yet this trade
with our great and powerful ally goes
up arid down, depending partly on the
whim of American beef producers and
their lobbying power in Washington,
and partly on unpredictable demand.
The Australian home market for
meat continues to decline and little, or
nothing, is done about it. There were
plans years ago for premium-graded
meats, common in America and
Europe, and for promotion of quality
lamb. The northern N.S.W. and
Queensland beef interests are, however,
more interested in canners for the
U.S. trade because this relatively low
grade of cattle is economically the type
they are best equipped to produce.
The beef men and the politicians will
fight this one out and whatever solu-
tion is arrived at will be, we shall be
told, in the national interest.
What amuses us, a nonentity and a
taxpayer, is that here once again we
have a board, created in the interests
of all, more concerned apparently with
the interests of some.
Agrisearch
A stimulant to plant growth
GIBBERELLIC ACID sprayed on
pasture at the vanishingly minute rate
of about one-sixth of an ounce per
acre has given a sixfold increase in
winter growth at Canberra. In push-
ing ever harder to scrounge the last
possible pound of wool from an acre
of grass, the CSIRO Division of Plant
Industry has been experimenting with
this enormously potent plant growth
stimulant. Its practical use will demand
very keen judgments by the farmer
concerning how, when, and where to
apply the treatment and how to benefit
fully from the extra feed obtained.
The margin for profit-consuming
errors at several points in the procedure
is narrow.
Up till now gibberellic acid has re-
mained something of an agricultural
toy in Australia. So far, only very
limited practical use has been made of
this phenomenal substance; for example
to encourage grapevines to bear larger
grapes in more uniform bunches, GA
was originally discovered by ICI, but
Japanese scientists first appreciated its
possibilities and pioneered its use in
horticultural crops. In recent years
the scientists seem to have tired
of its tricks, as they failed to find a
really significant application for any

of them. But this corner may now
have been turned.
If the pasture specialists at Canberra
can fit their new finding into com.
mercial farming to gain greater animal
production, it will apply to millions
of acres in southern Australia. Only a
modest reduction in the present price
of the chemical would be needed to
make its use on pasture a sound eco-
nomic proposition where the grader
is already stocking his pastures to the
limit. At the moment GA costs in the
vicinity of $6O an ounce; if the pastoral
industry presented a potential market,
the manufacturers might find that
large-scale production would permit a
substantial reduction in price.
Moreover, the Canberra scientists
are by no means certain that they
have yet found out how to use GA
most sparingly on pasture and still
obtain the greatest possible growth. In
the recent series of experiments, GA
produced extra feed from pasture at a
cost equivalent to that of an oat sup-
plement when this cereal costs 80 cents
a bushel. The economic position might
actually be more favorable for some
people than this calculation suggests,
because it assumes a certain degree of
wastage or inefficiency in the average
practical situation. A very careful
manager should be able to get closer
to the theoretical maximum return than
the average fellow. Also, the arithmetic
assumed that the cost of spraying the
growth stimulant over the pasture
would balance the costs involved in
hand-feeding, but probably spraying
would be cheaper.
There is a further strong possibility
that even better results than those
already reported might be obtained
under certain circumstances. Growth is
greatest, it seems, if the stimulant is
provided when the pasture has declined
to its slowest rate of growth. The ex-
periment performed at Canberra was
carried out in an odd year. Pasture
growth that winter was also higher
than normal. In a typical season,
therefore, GA treatment could be ex-
pected to boost growth beyond sixfold,
The same would apply in any district
where winter growth is less than at
Canberra.
The idea .of spraying GA bn pasture
was, in fact, first tested by Biddis-
combe, Arnold and Scurfield of CSIRO
Canberra, back in 1960, but, becausf
they happened to apply it later it
the winter, when the pasture was
already making appreciable growth
relatively little extra feed was won
Besides, they used a much greatei
quantity of GA. As a result, the eco-
nomics of the proposition looked hope-
less. The brighter prospects now stem
from the realisation that much less
GA is needed and that the treatmert
should be carried out when growth i*
at a minimum.

Paustovsky’s simple Revolution
By EUGENE KAMENKA
In That Dawn. Konstantin Paustovsky.
Translated from the Russian by
Manya Harari and Michael Duncan.
Collins. $3.85.
FOR ALMOST 50 years the Soviet
Union has been the most unsophisti-
cated of the world’s industrial and
semi-industrial societies. (Compare the
Russian intellectuals one meets with
the Indians!)
The most traumatic experiences of
20th - century intellectual life the
violence, poverty, and hunger of the
1920 s and 19305, the monstrous large-
scale inhumanities of Nazism and
Stalinism were experienced by
Russians at first-hand. But where these
experiences have helped Western
thinkers to work toward a deeper and
subtler conception of man and society,
the best of Soviet writers have been
allowed to respond (and then only
recently) in only one way: by regressing
into a shallow individualism, by pre-
tending that these were aberrations of
the human spirit, and that love,
sympathy, and humanity are still the
true expressions of the “common man.”
Konstantin Paustovsky, born in the
Ukraine in 1893, is today perhaps the
most respected of living older writers
among the Soviet, intelligentsia. He is
respected above all for his moral
integrity—expressed, as it too usual in
the Soviet Union, by having kept silent
while others shouted slogans. Cer-
tainly, Paustovsky is no Ehrenburg,
and the autobiographical “Story of a
Life” that he has been writing since
1949 has none of Ehrenburg’s shallow
politicking and distasteful self-glorifica-
tion. Ehrenburg is a journalist; Paus-
tovsky is a writer. Paustovsky, indeed,
is stylistically a beautiful writer. In
an age when the Russian language has
been coarsened, deadened, and bureauc-
ratised, Paustovsky is one of the few
prose writers to keep its charm and
responsiveness alive. The reader will
feel this even in translation.
“In That Dawn” is the third volume
of Paustovsky’s autobiography, covering
the most exciting period of his life,
from the February Revolution in 1917
until the evacuation of Deniken’s White
Army from the Crimea and the spring
of 1920. Paustovsky, in Moscow at the
time of the February Revolution, and
back again for the October Revolu-
tion, describes the endless meetings and
the endless firing. He is mistaken for
a White Guard sniper and almost shot;
he hears Lenin address soldiers on the
point of mutiny; he travels illegally to
the German-occupied Ukraine with a
group of journalists smuggling
diamonds; and watches the brutal kill-
ings (just for fun) of the anarchist
Bat’ka Makhno. He takes tea with an
elderly German governess and finds
himself forced to fight with the anti-
Bolshevik Cossacks of Hetman Pavlo
Skoropadski.
At a certain level, the book is a
masterpiece. Paustovsky’s treatment of
the Revolution is primarily whimsical;
his life during that period, and the life
of many others, was a comedy of errors
and confusions. What side a man
fought on at a certain moment might
depend on which side of the street he
was walking on as the firing began.
“The harsh, pitiless decrees of the
Soviet Government demolished our
familar background and shovelled it
aside . . . The change of concepts was
so startling that at times the very
ground of our existence seemed to give
way . . . Everyone felt a warning chill.
The weak staggered like drunkards.”
All this, of course, is the way in which
Russians wrote about the Revolution
while they were free, and Paustovsky
has revived the genre with talent and
skill.
At a deeper level, however, the book
is quite unsatisfactory. Even in the
older generation of Russians (let alone
in contemporary Western writers)
revolutionary events and happenings
provoke thoughts: thoughts about the
nature of man, and of society and of
historical change, thoughts about the
relation between means and ends,
thoughts about the character and values
of the revolutionary party. Here Paus-
tovsky rests on a simple, sentimental,
and simple-minded humanism. He does
not lie about the Revolution, as so many
Soviet writers do, he merely avoids all
the significant problems by treating men
quite apolitically, as good fellows or
bad fellows. There are more good
fellows on the side of the Bolsheviks
than against them; the Bolsheviks, being
common men in Paustovsky’s presenta-
tion rather than oracles of history, have
the virtues of the common people, not
over-idealised but never seriously ques-
tioned. Lenin alone appears in the book
(briefly) as the shadowy “Great
Father” of contemporary Soviet iconog-
raphy.
Paustovsky’s Revolution, then, is a
real revolution, a time of confusion and
Konstantin Paustovsky
uncertainty, of ludicrous poses, and
ruthless cynicism.
Underneath it, Paustovsky seems to
suggest, is a surging swell ieading to
a new' life. One has the impression that
he is, broadly speaking, in favor of it,
but one is also conscious of a very
considerable reticence. If Paustovsky
looks to man, it may well be because
he cannot speak about social move-
ments. In a far subtler way than
Ehrenburg, Paustovsky, too, has taken
the precaution of self-censorship in this
volume of the autobiography far more
than in any of the others. The result is
that his work, for all its charm, remains
ultimately insignificant.
Aboriginalities
By MARIE REAY
Aboriginal Myths and Legends. Roland
Robinson. Sun Books. $1.25.
THIS ADMITTEDLY attractive and
entertaining paperback collection of
Aboriginal stories will be an authentic
contribution to the distrust literate
people of Aboriginal descent have been
voicing of white men’s curiosity about
their distinctive traditions. Roland
Robinson, whose stature as a giant
anachronistic Jindyworabak owes much
to the use he has made of Aboriginal
culture, displays here a lapse of taste
and an inhumanity of the kind that
often lurks within a sentimental con-
cern with these oppressed original
inhabitants of the continent, who appear
in our written history as fauna with
nuisance value and have long been
known by anthropologists to be the
bearers of a rich and hidden culture.


Robinson recognises, in a self-revealing
but muddled preface, the distinction
Aborigines themselves make between
“sacred” and secular (“outside”) things,
but his collection of “myths and
legends” includes stories drawn from
both categories. The appropriate and
effective line drawings that illustrate
the book include “sacred” designs which
this reviewer personally would have
ethical qualms about publishing yet
again for massive “outside” distribu-
tion; and plainly the compiler has
violated the confidence of some of the
people listed as narrators. Myths held
sacred by Aborigines would seem to
require a more private readership.
Anthropologists may object that the
stories recounted here are not the fullest
or best versions available, and that
Robinson’s own imagination has some-
times ornamented the narrative he
heard. Certainly Maria Boney’s Just-So
stories for children have been
bowdlerised, and the salt water women’s
rollicking attribution of various bawdy
motives to the Old Woman and her
two siren “daughters” has been expur-
gated for male ears. The doggerel
transitional lyric, “Jacky Jacky,” as
recorded by Robinson, has lost so much
of the organic rhythm that was in it
two decades ago that one wonders
whether the transitional melody to
which it was sung has altered, too. The
story of King Clyde, from old Jack
Murray’s niece at Brewarrina, is more
authentic in literary form than some
other narratives, whose meandering
associational stream has been cut off
and occasionally spliced in either the
telling or the transcription; but this
one is marred by the compiler’s ignor-
ance of the mingga tree and the super-
natural ideas that surround this class of
“natural” objects. Anthropologists and
literate Aborigines can find some unin-
tended “inside” jokes, as when an
Aboriginal name for one totemic char-
acter is paired with a Strine name for
another.
Robinson’s linguistic naivete is hinted
at obliquely in T. G. H. Strehlow’s
condensed translation of a tape record-
ing of a Western Aranda sky-man story,
where all but one of Robinson’s own
questions have been deleted. The one
left in is a leading question, a positive
suggestion that the stars may be like
fires, which the Aboriginal narrator
adopts and develops in visual terms.
The Aboriginal prompter “says some-
thing indistinct” in an aside to the
Aboriginal narrator when the latter
agrees “The stars are just like fires.”
If a different leading question had been
asked, would the texture of imagery in
the story have varied at this point (for
example, “The stars are just like water-
holes” or “The stars are just like emu
e gg s ”)? One has the feeling that the
prompter would have made an identical
comment and that this would still have
been heard indistinctly.
Strehlow himself, who is free of this
linguistic naivete, must share with the
Western Aranda men some amusing
memories of the compiler’s presence
among them. Aborigines everywhere,
in the reviewer’s experience, have jokes
at the expense of all who visit them,
and visitors who know what the jokes
are about themselves and can infer how
these arose acquire an extra dimension
of understanding that appears to be
absent from Robinson’s familiarity with
Aborigines.
Robinson has selected stories which
he believes express “the Aboriginal
nature, its character and feeling.” This
is a more ambitious task than Elkin,
the greatest living authority on the
Aborigines, sets himself in trying to
show readers “how to understand
them.” What Elkin accepts as
mysteries, Robinson purports to explain
in a Jungian jargon that suits the surg-
ing cadences so congenial to him. In
his searching for the Aboriginal Soul,
he encounters characters that “strike
chords within us that sound into the
past.” His view of mythology, emphati-
cally expressed, is old-fashioned. “The
definition of mythology as a part of
ritual is a factual one,” he asserts; but
Stanner’s essays on Aboriginal religion
have demonstrated convincingly that
this is not so —that, on the contrary,
Aboriginal religion is a complex struc-
ture of rite and myth, with the two
sometimes parallel but appearing inde-
pendently as myth without ritual and
ritual without myth.
This general collection of Aboriginal
myths and legends includes an interest-
ing and tantalisingly incomplete legend
from the extinct Tasmanian people, said
to have been recorded in 1890 by Dr.
J. Milligan on Blinders Island. Other
secondary sources are A. W. Howitt,
Ursula McConnel, and Mrs. K.
Langlow Parker, all more skilled
recorders than Robinson himself.
Jolting along
By NANCY KEESING
The Lights of Cobb and Co. K. A.
Austin. Rigby. $4.25.
When Cobb and Co. Was King. Will
Lawson. Angus and Robertson. 85c.
IN 1853 four young Americans in their
twenties, Lreeman Cobb, John Murray
Peck, James Swanton, and John B.
Lander, arrived in Melbourne. By the
following year they had launched a
venture which revolutionised Aus-
tralian passenger transport by land.
The original firm was to change owner-
ship many times, and a bewildering
number of subsidiaries and other firms
was to use its name. Lreeman Cobb
himself left Australia in 1856 and died
in his forty-eighth year in South Africa
in 1878. But his name, and the con-
tinuing name and reputation of the
industry he fostered, became legendary
in Australia and remains evocative even
today.
The story of Cobb and Co., of men like
Cobb and Peck, of James Rutherford,
who directed its fortunes for 50 years,
of its coaches, horses, drivers, business
managers, factories, and adventures, is
told well, ’ although sometimes repeti-
tively, by K. A. Austin in a well-docu-
mented, generously illustrated, indexed
book. Every aspect of Cobb and Co.’s
history is fully covered and its influ-
ence upon the outback economy and
its sociological importance is set down.
There had, of course, been coaches
and coaching companies in Australia
before 1854. Most of them vanished,
sometimes almost literally overnight,
before Cobb’s new, efficient competi-
tion.
Indeed, the only aspect of this spec-
tacular success story which Austin does
not stress sufficiently is the awfulness
of the passenger coach industry before
Cobb’s time. The older established
firms not only lacked machines suit-
able to Australian conditions, but what
vehicles they had were often operated
dishonestly, inefficiently, discourteously,
and with immense discomfort. J. R.
Godley in 1853 paid £2/10/- for a box
seat on “a very good omnibus” leaving
Sydney for Bathurst, only to find that,
at Parramatta, the omnibus, which was
purely a showpiece, was substituted for
a “spring cart” so heavily loaded that
there was no room, literally, for the
passengers to sit with their legs
extended. * To add insult to injury
Godley found that “it is not the custom
for successive drivers to be bound by
each other’s arrangements, so I lost my
‘box seat’ which had been already
engaged by a Parramatta passenger.”
These earlier carriers were notorious
for their drunkenness and unscheduled
visits to roadside inns and for the hair-
raising risks they took.
I cannot too strongly recommend
that Pacific Book’s reprint of Will
Lawson’s 1936 novel, “When Cobb and
Co. Was King,” be read in conjunction
with Austin’s history. As a novel
judged by true critical standards, it is
only mediocre, although its shapeless
story is exciting enough. But Lawson’s
pictures (especially in the early
chapters) of the daily routine at a
Cobb and Co. change station supple-
ment Austin’s history and give another
dimension to some of his illustrations.
Lawson’s accounts of teams, drivers,
grooms, and journeys are based firmly
not only on fact but on a thorough
understanding of every smallest detail
of training, harnessing, and driving.
Probably no one now, or ever again,
will write quite so convincingly of
these matters, because Lawson possessed
an unselfconscious knowledge of those
nearly lost arts. Austin is no mere
pedantic historian, but despite his enter-
prise in travelling over old coaching
routes, interviewing surviving Cobb and
Co. employees, and despite his well-
chosen excerpts from contemporary
prose and ballad verse, his book cannot,
and perhaps because of its nature should
not, convey the smell, sound, rock, and
sweat of Lawson’s.

Modern Occasions. Edited by Philip
Rahv. Weidenfeld and Nicolson.
$6.40.
The Liverpool Scene. Edited by Edward
Lucie-Smith. Carroll. (Price not
available.)
PHILIP RAHV’S anthology is pre-
faced by a note which denies that the
writing or the selection can be called
“avant-garde,” and claims that only
cultist mannerisms are left of the old
movements that embraced the term.
This is not to say that there is no
unconventional writing or enterprising-
design in the book, of course, and the
whole collection seems designed to
prove that good and non-reactionary
writing doesn’t need the cachet of being
avant-garde.
Rahv’s anthology contains fiction,
poetry, a play, and some critical essays,
one of which is a splendidly indignant
analysis of the nature and activities,
assumptions, and arguments of the
various avant-garde groups, written by
the fine German satiric poet Hans
Magnus Enzensberger. The essay is a
very important one, dealing with the
clash between so-called Progressive
and Reactionary writers and critics and
showing the relationship between Re-
actionaries without power (vague and
neuter “open-mindedness” and pompous
condescension), and Reactionaries with
the power of a police state behind
them (Goebbels’ viciousness, Zhdanov’s
blind prejudice). Enzensberger does
not hesitate to link avant-gardist ways
of writing, especially verbal and struc-
tural experimentation such as the work
of Dadaists, Futurists, Surrealists, and
the like, with the appeal of totalitarian
systems. A list of the elements that
avant-gardists themselves recognise in
their work is worth quoting:
. . . improvisation, chance, moment
of imprecision, interchangeability,
indefiniteness, emptiness; reduction
to pure motion, pure action, absolute
motion, motoricity, mouvement pure .
Arbitrary motion, empty kinetic acti-
vity, is the typical appeal of totali-
tarian ideas, Enzensberger claims (fol-
lowing Hannah Arendt). He adds
examples from various areas, pointing
out
. . . the latent acts of violence in
avant-garde “movements,” which, to
be sure, is (sic) directed first against
the “materials” with which they are
dealing: they blindly toss about
paints, tones, or world fragments
rather than hurling hand-grenades
or Molotov cocktails.
It may seem odd to refer so care-
fully to one essay in a large anthology,
but Enzensberger, it seems to me, is
worth remembering when we read and
judge modern writing. He is not a
“culture-vulture” despising the Sym-
bolistes and every writer after them,
but a fully involved writer concerned
with the difference between loud col-
lective manifestos and the facts of
writing. The distinctions he makes are
distinctions between literature (and
other arts) and mere gesture or move-
ment. He has his faults, omitting the
major achievements of the Beats in
favor of their dictates and public
image, but in that particular case
Stephen Donadio’s article in the an-
thology can redress the balance to
some extent. Where his value becomes
obvious is in looking at work by mod-
ern writers that have the group (En-
zensberger calls it “collective”) mani-
festo written or unwritten beside
their typewriters.
“The Liverpool Scene” is edited by
Edward Lucie-Smith, top bright young
man of the London poetry-and-culture
establishment, but the contributions are
poems and tiny plays from the Liver-
pool writers associated with “Beat
culture.” The writers can’t be found
guilty of association with the editor, who
is merely getting in on the act, but
their mutual esteem makes them very
much a movement, and the genuine
and enthusiastic audience they’ve devel-
oped gives them every reason for the
self-congratulatory reactions of the


avant-garde. To do them justice, they
do not claim to be avant-anything.
They know the Beatles and the whole
Liverpool pop industry gave them their
start, they claim to have no literary
heritage, and they are never leading,
only “with it.”
The volume is small (and not cheap),
dominated by the work of three poets’
Adrian Henri, Roger McGough, and
Brian Patten. It has some excellent and
some chi-chi photographs, some slick
and some charming poems, with a keen
sense of humor and a keener sympathy
with teenagers (or thereabouts) trapped
in a dull, middle-aged, and moralistic
society. I don t have any doubts that
Adrian Henri s reputation, which is
bigger than Patten’s or McGough’s, is
largely undeserved, as his contributions
are slick bids for laughter rather than
effective poems; but even he has his
moments. When he is not piling up
contempoiaiy inferences or lists of
eioes (Jaiiy, ini au , an * PP°
naire crop up a lot), he can throw a
fine innocent image into the grim con-
text of working-class Liverpool, an
image such as the beat (though not
the words) of the Beatles has con-
jured up for so many devotees.
McGough and Patten are better, and
McGough’s “Monika” series has a
shrewdness that is more than its pop-
art ingredients could add up to. Both
poets write frequently of apocalypses of
love or of nuclear war, and with poetry
spoken for an audience the wish-
fulfilment or fear-fulfilment images are
(or become) natural and useful. At
their worst they are like Henri in
relying on one or two comic or
pathetic images more effective than the
poem written around them. Some of
the images are worth while and excuse
the poem, of course, as in McGough’s
Bomb poem:
Mother, polish your identity bracelet
there is a mushroom cloud in the back
garden
I did, I tried to bring in the cat
but it simply came to pieces in my
hand . . .
Pop-art, slick references to Batman
and the other pulp heroes, the throng-
ing topical references, can only be effec-
tive when, as happens sometimes, they
tie back into the world of Liverpool,
the myth-world of the poems. I love
the cover inset which shows Batman
in goal punching the ball away sternly,
with the cry of Liverpool’s fanatical
Soccer supporters printed red behind
him, “Ee-Aye-Addia”! The same thing
can happen with the other conventions
of innocent and apocalyptic spoken
poetry throughout the book, where the
Mersey Beat Generation becomes a real
voice of its audience and a voice to the
outside world.
I am convinced that, with all its
faults, failures, and crassnesses, spoken
poetry of this or the Ginsberg kind
is the necessary development from
the present uncertain and minimal re-
lation of poetry and audience. Already
several fine poems have been designed
for this medium, and audiences, not
only in Liverpool, are responding to
them as something quite separate from
“poetry,” a school tedium. Not that
only poetry written for this presentation
can succeed in capturing the special
power and confidence of voice, I mean.
First-person poetry of various kinds is
the typical product of our day and
not ironic self-mockeries, either, but
open and “confessional” poetry, oratory
in verse, the monologue of an invented
character, and so on.
One of the finest examples of a poet
whose verse lives off the speaking voice
is Robert Lowell, whose version of
Juvenal’s Tenth Satire is the finest
single contribution to “Modern
Occasions.” Other poetry in the vol-
ume needs to be read aloud, though
none is as oratorically domineering as
Lowell’s. I look forward to the day
when LPs of poetry, tapes of poetry,
public performances of poetry will be
as common as those of chamber music
or of the Beatles in their day. Rahv’s
anthology indicates that this need not
be limited to verse, either, for both
Irvin Faust and that magnificent
novelist John Barth have splendid
tours de force in monologue in the
collection.
Foreign Rooms
To sing abroad,
To groan at the rain and then
As early snow blows in
To sing again
Of a far-off
Tinder-dry season,
Leafglitter and shaggy bark,
Is to sing with reason
Of what is felt
And most profoundly known,
But in your boxlike rooms
You build alone.
Dejection grows,
A seed in the heart of day
With fibrous fronds of root
And twigs of grey
That will not yield
Berry or pod or leaf
But cast a shade exactly
The shade of grief;
Slyly it grows
And draws up nourishment
From anything offered, said,
Revealed or lent
In the course of days,
Week by unguarded week,
While the breath of alien winter
Is bitter-bleak,
And the voices
Do not sound like yours,
And a foreign ocean
Scuffs the dull shores.
Ah, the grey plant
Will shrivel as you meet
The blessing of green familiar trees
On a known street,
But you cry abroad
Where fields are blank and chill,
And now, as the drifts thicken,
Cry louder still.

Edible Oils
In your issue of April 15 you state that
“the vegetable-oil growers, whose
interests Marrickville have so vigor-
ously canvassed in the past, have
nothing to gain by the success of a
product (Eta Super Spread Cooking
Margarine) which is mainly tallow.
The booming go-go oilseeds of former
Marrickville publicity have been left
out on a limb.” May I respectfully
suggest that this statement indicates a
misunderstanding of the place the new
product will play and the use of our
quotas.
Eta Super Spread Cooking Mar-
garine replaces Eta Table Margarine,
which previously absorbed the larger
proportion of our quotas, and which
was not made wholly from vegetable
oils. Henceforth, the whole of our
quotas will be devoted to Miracle,
which is an all-vegetable oil, all-Aus-
tralian margarine. Thus the truth is
that the introduction of Eta Super
Spread Cooking Margarine will mean a
substantial increase in my company’s
purchases of vegetable oils from Aus-
tralian growers.
If our combined production of
Miracle and Eta Super Spread were to
rise as strongly as we expect, the effect
will be dramatically to increase our
demand for Australian vegetable oils as
compared with the intake possible since
last November, when we were forced
back to our quota level.
For the vegetable-oil growers of Aus-
tralia, however, this is only a palliative.
The Australian vegetable-oils industry
will have no secure future until mar-
garine made from all-Australian raw
materials is freed from quota control.

Trains in Spain
Barry Jones’ dogmatic, seasoned-
traveller approach (8., March 25) falls
somewhat flat upon the ears of those
who know Spain when he mentions
ten-peseta notes, as these have never
existed; as has never existed the lack
of facilities for washing and eating at
Irun Station —dingy though it may be.
Rather on the principle of “What
goes in must necessarily come out,” no
greater absurdity (ten-peseta notes
apart) may be observed than that of the
Estacion del Norte being only an IN
station. This misunderstanding is
clearly explained by Mr. Jones him-
self, albeit unconsciously. Even th
Spaniards’ patience has its limits. J
demand “primero clasa,” etc., etc., J
the sort of language that ranks along
side the “parley voo,” “savvy,” an|
“madermersel” type of French, f 0
example, is calculated to try th
patience of any humble functionary,
Their failure to understand, howevei
did prove an effective way of getting
rid of Mr. Jones! Nonetheless, train
do leave the Estacion del Norte, but
not those going to Vienna.

The Jurong Area
As one who commutes regularly througt
the Jurong industrial area, I must dis
agree with Peter Samuel, who state:
in his article on Australian trade witl
Malaysia and Singapore (8., April 8;
that the Jurong industrial area is mort
sites than factories. As a point ol
interest, after reading the article !
counted the number of factories in thi
space of one half mile; there were 12
with many more to be seen in tht
background; the estate extends to a
much greater distance than my journej
takes me. While not suggesting that
the industrial area of Singapore hai
reached its full potential, I do no
think the comment was fair or factual

Campbelliana
Ross Campbell’s researches into th
names of firms appear to have onl;
skimmed the surface of the wealth o
material that lies at depth on thi
subject for the dedicated seeker.
Alas, in dealing with his Melbourm
experiences, Mr. Campbell failed t(
mention the old favorite:
What chance is there of another re
tailer doing well in Melbourne?
answer: Buckley’s and Nunn.” Nor di(j
he list for eager students of Campbel
liana the solemn excellence of the titli
of the Sydney legal firm “Priddlt.
Gosling, Dalrymple, and Sillar,” no;
the indescribable joy that comes fron
receiving a letter from Abbott, Tout!
Creer, and Wilkinson, signed
the Younger.” One Creer the Olde
letter is reported to be worth six Creej
the Youngers on the legal letters black)
market, but sadly one has never conn
my way. Perhaps after this letter . •

the most thick skinned cars in the world
A BMC car, and BMC alone, gives you the investment and safety protection of
Rotodip 7 skin deep rust protection. Rotodip is unique because car bodies actually
rotate through special cleaning and rustproofing solutions. Result: no air pockets
can form; every inch of the body, inside and out is treated. Rust (it starts on the
inside) can’t form, can’t weaken the inherent body strength of your car. Rotodip
rust protection is one reason why your BMC car is safer. Others: BMC’s better
front wheel handling, better braking, unique stay-on-line Hydrolastic* fluid
suspension. You buy a safe car, an advanced car when you buy BMC. There’s one
to suit your needs exactly!
