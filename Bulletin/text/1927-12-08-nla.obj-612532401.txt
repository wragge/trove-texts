The Red Page
Wells’s Yarns
Wells has on occasion proved himself so
supreme a master in the large, leisurely
canvas of the novel that it is not surprising
that his short stories have suffered some
neglect by comparison. The pattern of
“Mr. Polly” and “Kipps” was new to us
when they appeared, and even the stricter,
more formal structure of “Tono-Bungay” and
“The New Machiavelli” had its element of
surprise; and the novels were so definite
as works of art, in a time only beginning
to realise that the short story was some-
thing more than journalism, that it is pos-
sible even Wells himself considered his
short pieces comparatively small potatoes
Since then the times have changed, and
the short story has taken its true place. A.
E. Coppard, Henry Lawson, Martin Arm-
strong,-Ernest Bramah, Gerald Bullett, Stacy
Aumonier, Sherwood Anderson have all
made their modern renderings of Poe’s mini-
atures, and have established themselves as
experts in the flashlight vision of life. That,
too, has helped to obscure the value of
Wells; all these men, with the exceptions
of Lawson and Bramah, have some trick of
condensation, some technical device which
makes them seem so modern that Wells
seems in comparison old-fashioned in the
hurry of to-day and to-morrow. Criticism
tacitly accepts him as a good short-story
man in his decade, but....
Then a publisher comes along, a good
bookseller who judges that all this fuss
about the ins-and-outs of the short story
ought to create a demand for a collection
of them by some recognised man—say, H.
G. Wells. He wrote a good many of them
at one time, and some of them were not too
bad, if the bookseller’s memory serves him.
A good thick book—value for money—and
an authentic topnotcher’s name on it. So
we get The Short Stories of H. G. Wells
(Benn; Dymock’s), 63 yarns, 1152 pages, all
for three half-crowns. Excellent value for
money; it is safe to say that a lot of people
will be glad of the opportunity to own the
collection—not critics, but people who re-
member yarns which they liked at a time
when yarns seemed pretty poor, on the
whole. That ghastly story about the spiders,
for instance, and the tale of the valley
where everyone was blind—and that, other
one about the toadstools, and the extra-
ordinary yarn about the bicycle thing that
was really a time machine.
The important people who buy books
being satisfied and the bookseller thereby
justified, the critic comes in, and, to his
shame, is astonished by the literary value
of these popular yarns. Compare the best
story that Coppard has written, “Broadsheet
Ballad,” with “The Purple Pileus,” the toad-
stool yarn. Coppard imposes his strange
vision of life in terms of a broadsheet ballad,
the bucolic penny melodrama with its stiff
two-color blocks, its rough edges, its sym-
metrical reward of virtue and punishment
of vice. Wonderfully the very sheet comes
into being in your hands as you read; at
the end Of the second paragraph you are
thinking with Coppard’s marvellously sen-
sitive mind, so great is the power of his
technique in the imposing of his vision. In
"Jhe Purple Pileus” you know nothing o'
Wellss aggressive pontificating mind; you
can’t tell at what point you slipped into
the skin, heart and mind of Mr. Codmbes
who got drunk (instead of killing himself;
by eating the purple toadstools, and stag-
gered home to tell his slipshod, henpecking
wife what he thought of her and her beastly
friends. All you know is that it served the
loafers glad, and that Coombes was a decent
little cove who deserved to have saved his
business and his faith in himself; it was
a bit of luck his finding those toadstools anc
trying to poison himself with them. Behind
that simplicity of effect there is obviouslv
much better technique than that behind the
marvels of “Broadsheet Ballad,” great in
their degree as these are.
Compare “The Country of, the Blind”
with any of Walter de la Mare’s imaginings.
You are conscious all the time of the beau-
tiful phrasing in De la Mare’s work; it would
spoil the effect of harmonious beauty if the
characters came too positively to life. Wells
does not descend to mere phrasing; his
vision is so clear and complete that he can’t
—he can only tell fit straight out as he sees
it. You re there, in that valley, not in any
place of a skilful writer’s mind; and your
only fooling is that you like boing thore in
tho placid beauty. Which is obviously far
and away ahead of merely admiring to be
there.
We cannot compare the chill dread, the
shudder of “The Valley of Spiders” with
any modern writer’s matter, because there
if f °.ne with the pluck to imagine it plus
the skill to make us feel the horrible thing.
Again, you are there, and you hate and are
terrified to be there.
One could go on, but there are 63 of
these yarns The best of Gerald Bullett’s
dainty, wholly admirable fairy-stories can’t
hold a candle to the sheer conviction the
evident truth of “The Magic Shop”’ In
Stacy Aumonier’s reticent tragedies it is
the pattern of the pungent reticence that is
so literarily striking, so good. But in “The
Door m the Wall” a world of tragedy comes
sweeping at you in an unpatterned silence.
Like most of the other stories, it is a work
of art far above the mere rules of criticism
Indeed, saddening as the confession may be
m these modern days, it is clear that Wells
wrote better short stories than all the
modern men, and that even 63 of them in
one book cannot fatigue the honest critic
into saying otherwise.

Characteristics of Australian Poetry
The striking characteristics of the verse
of this country are simplicity and a
complete lack of straining after effect; an
exhilaration due perhaps to our outdoor
life; warmth of color; vivid imagery; and
a strange high light suggestive of the
Australian sunlight itself.
We have poets who study form, as did
Grey and Wordsworth and Mrs. Browning.
Such are Vidler, Broinowski, Lavater and
young Colin Bingham, who tends to con-
sider his technique so much that he irons
out the individuality and spontaneity. But
because I am optimistic in my outlook in
Australian poetry I am going to deal with
the finer points, and leave the weak and
the bad to obtrude themselves.
We may never have a Milton or a Gray.
But Roderic Quinn and Bernard O’Hara
have all the simplicity of Wordsworth and
his love of quiet landscape. They do not
attain t'he dignity which he reached, but
they lack the posing of which he was too
often guilty. Here is an O’Hara picture
in five lines:—
The little creek goes winding
Through gums of white and blue,
A silver arm
Around the farm
It flings, a lover true. >
And Winifred Shaw, a very young poet, is
able to depict a scene so vividly, yet
with such simplicity, that I venture to
predict she will, if she develops consistently
reach the skill in ballad which was Cole-
ridge’s.
As for exhilaration, the sheer joy of
living, I know of nohe better than Llywelyn
Lucas, a very Ariel, so impatient of restric-
tion that she even risks expressing herself
in free verse, to, which Australians are
not partial. Many a high thought is spoiled
by being couched in this verse', which tends
to wander on through a maze of imagery
that culminates in hysteria. There seems
no justification for it. A poet is essenti-
ally a musician; even though he does not
know a note of music he feels and is
governed by a law of rhythm; and
thoughts which cannot be confined to
rhythm, be harnessed with the silver trap-
pings of metrical music, may as well be
honestly labelled prose. However, Miss
Lucas’s work is so tremendously alive that
this is a phase which she will outgrow.
Even in her wistful moods we detect an
elfin touch.
We love the lights in the hollows
And the low-dreeing wind....
she writes of the “sorrowful, the predes-
tined,” in “Wild Souls.” And she pro-
duces bits of fun like this:—
Moon is a monkey
Climbing a tree
That sheds a black shadow
On Noddy and me!—-
A ’normous black shadow
Right over the sky !
Who’s frightened?
Who’s frightened ?
Who’s frightened?
Not I!
Llywelyn Lucas fits in exactly with whim,
caprice, frolic. Even in her few moments
of sadness, we feel she is going to jest the
very next minute.
Now for warm color, L. H. Allen, in
“The Flame-tree”:—
Ah, that intensest red,
Romp of exhilarant flame,
Drinking and tossing heat
In salamander game!
And imagery. The same poet in “Hes-
perides”:—
And when the oranges, like dragon-eyes,
Blink in the sunset....
A swarthy centaur leans from out his lair,
Whose sleepy pupils catch the full-moon rise.
L. H. Allen does not get nearly enough
recognition for his beautiful sonnets, and
his ability to feel deeply and launch into
glittering seas of imagery.
They err who say our poets do not
employ tricks of metre to help out their
themes. Here is an example of form which
makes much charm for the subject-matter.
The lines are from “Mona Lisa,” by Robert
Murray. He pleads with her to smile:—
Not with sad eyes
That seem to mock at mirth,
Nor song that dies
In sorrow at its birth; *
but to come with him to seek the sweeter,
simpler joys each knew in their youth—
and concludes:—
Then tread no more
In devious paths, and leave
, The bitter lore
The serpent taught to Eve;
Forget the smart
And all the old-world sin ;
Open~ your heart
And let the sun shine in.
The alternate use of two and three feet in
a line gain a distinctly artistic effect. I
add the final verse of “Ships,” by Enid
Cameron for its dignity:—
And, rosy-sailed, gold-masted, far and high,
Leaning with radiant load,
Move statelily to harbor in the sky,
The lovely ships of God.
We forgive the forced rhyme, because one
could not describe clouds more happily.
I have left until last that most beauti-
ful characteristic <of all, and one which is
(Continued on page 5.)

as peculiar to Australian poetry as to our
landscape. I refer to a strange wild beauty
which contains something of Celtic poig-
nancy, the color of Iberia, the cadence of
Gaul. There is the same sweet abandon
about it as there is in the tang of the
scrub and winds from the coast, ’the same
wealth of emotion that throbbed in the
songs of the Troubadours. It is hard to
find an adequate name for this trait —how
could one name a warm, colored light fall-
ing across a landscape, wrapping it in a
glamor one can never forget? How could
one name the innocent freshness of one’s
very first idyll—the bloom upon the body
and face of a very young child? Never-
theless the light, the freshness, the bloom,
exist, just as this strange characteristic
exists in many of our verses, provided, of
course, that we are gifted with the poetic
vision to detect it. When one analyses
the naked words, the light fades, the gilt is
gone—momentarily. Piece them together
again, read them aloud, and presto! it is
back, like a kind of essence distilled from
our own drenching sunlight and startling
flowers. One might call it lustre, glamor;
or sheer magic, and get nearer the truth.
E. M. ENGLAND.
John Ridley v. Charles I.
The teacher was giving a lesson on Wil-
liam the Conqueror. “How did William the
Conqueror get over to England?” he asked;
and the smart boy promptly answered, “By
aeroplane, sir.” And not a child noticed
the absurdity of the remark. To them it
seemed quite natural in these days of aero-
planes and airships that the stout old war-
rior would travel in such a fashion. Time
has little or no meaning for children; they
cannot grasp the natural sequence of events
that extend over hundreds of years, so his-
tory teachers resort to various adventitious
aids, such as illustrated time-lines of dates,
characters and events in order to develop
the time sense necessary for the proper
understanding of history. But these would
not be so necessary if history were taught
from the right end—from the known to
the unknown, from contemporary history to
that of the past. Instead, we begin with
Julius Caesar, and proceed to the Jutes,
Angles and Saxons; then to the Normans in
England; and so on, right down through
the ages. If the characters who strut through
the pages of history are good, we make
them very good, and if they once exhibited
any bad trait we make them wicked. So
our children receive a series of false impres-
sions which they must unlearn during years
of higher education. With those that do
not receive any higher education than that
which ceases at 14 the false impressions re-
main.
As for Australian history, that is a mere
side-line. Certainly it does not extend much
over 150 years, whereas the story of Britain
and the Empire extends for nearly 2000
years. But those 150 years are of more
importance to us than all the 2000 years of
British history. It is more valuable to Aus-
tralian boys and girls to learn that John
Ridley, of South Australia, produced the first
stripper in 1842 than to know that Oliver
Cromwell signed the death-warrant of
Charles I. in 16A). That a king should be
executed nearly 300 years ago has no signifi-
cance to-day. But that a man should by
an invention pave the way for the economi-
cal handling of all farming operations, and
concomitantly be the indirect means of
peopling some of the vast spaces of an
empty continent, and so materially advanc-
ing the common weal, is, from a true his-
torical standpoint, of vital importance.
We should teach more of these stories of
our Ridleys and our McKays. By learning
such a mass of British history to the neglect
of our own, we Australians have received an
almost indelible impression that we cannot
do anything. So the cry goes up, “If we
only had more British capital and American
brains and enterprise, what wonders we
could perform”; and thus we are prone to
neglect the powers that lie within us, and
the opportunities at hand. I also believe
that this is the reason that Australian work-
men have allowed, even elected, British and
foreign importees to hold executive positions
in their unions, to the yery great detriment
of Australian trade-unionism. By the his-
tory taught in our schools we kill the Aus-
tralian spirit.
If I had my way—which, alas! I have not
—I would teach history beginning with to-
day, not with 55 b.c. There is more fascina-
tion and truth in learning how the town we
live in came to be than in learning why
Robert Lord Clive committed suicide. So
I say commence with the school, and reach
outward and backward through the village
or town or city to the State and then to
the Commonwealth. Survey the history of
industry, local and continent-wide; follow
with eager minds attuned to pulsing life the
flights of Ross and Keith Smith, Parer and
Mclntosh; and, turning back to the men
who explored the trackless wilds of a great
continent Sturt, Kennedy, Leichhardt,
Eyre, Stuart, as well as Bass and the great
Flinders—watch the gallant struggles of the
pioneer settlers, or trace the vagrant foot-
steps of the ardent gold-diggers. When Aus-
tralian history has thus been studied, turn
to British history, and, still working back-
wards, proceed from story to story until we
reach Julius Caesar. Thus, and only thus,
would history be given its right perspective,
and that Roman emperor appear, as he
should, a mere pinpoint on the great map of
time; while the plain, hard-working chap
who wears a small circular brass badge in the
lapel of his coat, a badge more honorable
than the Garter, would be, as he really is,
a king among men to his youthful descend-
ants.
COUNTRY PED.
Melba’s Successor
Mr. Walter Thorman says “Australian
singers show that the training received in
their own country is sufficient to give them
a good start.” I don’t wish to dissect in
public the purely private affairs of the
five Australian singers thereupon named
by him. Perhaps it will be sufficient to
say that the first two on his list are
still receiving tuition of a character
certainly more than enough to “merely
keep them up to the mark.” They have
both been studying assiduously and ex-
pensively since leaving here, and competent
critics have assured me that they are much
the better for it. In my first article I
named two years as an average minimum
time necessary for further study in London.
These two artists have already exceeded
it. As for Miss Osborne, critics in this
country praised her before ever she went
to the Conservatorium. She has a “freak”
voice, pure and precious, a voice which has
always excited admiration. In spite of
this, I doubt whether she will ever rise to
the topmost heights. As Mr. Thorman
wisely says, a second Melba must have
voice, brains, musicianship, taste, person-
ality and will-power of equal standard.
Melba would have been a phenomenal
success in anything she cared to undertake.
To my mind, she is easily the most remark-
able, unique and brilliant woman this
country has ever produced. At the present
moment her only serious successor is the
glorious-voiced and intellectually-endowed
Austral.
One thing I cannot quite forgive Mr.
Thorman—his statement that “had Miss
Osborne been a pupil of some London
teacher, such a success would have gained
instant recognition and placed him at the
top of the tree.” Anyone who has lived
in London must characterise this statement
as absurd. London receives singers from all
over the world. The press acclaims many
of them. Astute concert managers pick
the winners. Covent Garden goes looking
for successful vocalists from Europe, and
if they make good, which they do at rare
intervals, London doesn’t ask whether they
were pupils of Monsieur Robusto of Paris
or Signora Coloratura of Rome.
KEITH BARKY.
The Basic Peril
The Greatest War being over, there is to-
day no more striking commentary on the
basic savagery irn human nature than the
modern extra-magmificent super-creations in
celluloid. No film on which the statutory
million dollars have been spent is complete
without labored scenes of cruelty and
oppression in which? there is never the least
hint of justification'for the oppressors, dis-
plays of monstrous:- savagery unredeemed
even by anger* —brutality for brutality’s
sake. Witness a troop of newly captured
slaves being flogged? across a desert {vide
a scene from “Ben Ilur”). Could you have
action more ■ devoid ,of motive than that?
Bad in art, the whipping is probably false
historically, for the Jman who used a whip
as freely as depicted in this scene would
surely have 'been sadked for damaging Gov-
ernment property.
The effect on the spectator is the import-
ant point. Such a scene cannot provide a
dramatic experience '< because it cannot be
understood'through ;fee minds of the actors.
To all appearances tiue guard has no motive
of anger, revenge or) amusement for whip-
ping the stumbling vfcretches. Consequently,
the cruelty becomes |an unrelated piece of
naked barbarism which- can. have significance
only as the means of exciting in the average
beholder a vicarious of such
savage cruelty as modern daws and conven-
tions forbid'. (Not entirely. Some sfhafl
boys, though they are rare, indulge the
appetite.- by chopping up) live 'frogs, putting
cats in /ovens, etc.) Tonsome \people these
scenes are merely boring ;*.to others—usually
gentle-minded women—they are % revolting;
so revolting sometimes as to induce a
nausea lasting for severab days. But to the
average mind they must be pleasure-giving.
Else why do they abound in ewery film
which has been costly to make % and which
must have the widest possible appeal in
order to recoup l the makers? The matter
provides food* for useful thought mfter read-
ing reports , off disarmament speeches at
Geneva.
L. TOWNSEND.
A Satchel of Books
“Slatipac,” ' by O'. C. Weber ' (Weber and
Young). asi the author puts it: —
A to memorise,
Thijough'Uittle; rhymes and ditties,
All hands and islands of the world,
And their' capital towns and cities.
Others Abide* by Humbert Wojfe (Benn).
The poetry of Humbert Wolfe is mgrked by
a grace and felicity that , give him almost the
highest place atnong the few busy literary
craftsmen of tine-day who write verse. The
present short: volume of translations
from the Greek, brief and epigrammatical,
but all mai£ked (by happy expression.
The Kingdom of Theophilus, by William
J. Locke (pohn jLane). Few authors have
enjoyed so> long a reign of popularity as
Mr. Locke. The secret of this attraction
appears* to*<lie in ltis recognition that human
nature is. untouched by time. This latest
novel sho/tvs no aba tement' in charm of style
or crispnfcss of char acterisaition.
Everyman's Libra ry (Dent). Recent addi-
tions to« this extensive and popular series
are “Tbfe Life and (of John Keats,”
“The Brothers Karlimazov” f (2 vols.), “The
Admirable Crichton,” and, for readers of
theology, Renan’s “The Life of Jesus.”
There remains a laugh for the young folk in
Edward Lear’s “A Book of Nonsense.”
The Mystery of the Polar Stwr, by E. R.
G. R. Evans (Partridge). The author, who
began his career as a writer in The Bue-
eetin and is now a C.B. and a D.S.O. and
was one of the Scott Antarctic expedition
party, spins vigorous yarns of the sea that
should thrill the heart of any normal boy.
This one gives a vivid picture of life in the
Antarctic regions, judiciously mingling solid
information with fictional melodrama.
Land Tenure and Agricultural Production
in the Tropics, by H. Martin Leake
(Heifer). The author, formerly Director of
Agriculture in the United Provinces, India,
and Principal of the Imperial College of
Tropical Agriculture, Trinidad, discusses the
influence of land policy on development in
tropical countries. It is suggested that, in
place of the existing tenure in land so far
as the agricultural development of Britain’s
tropical empire is concerned, a triple part-
nership of the Crown, the landlord and the
cultivator should be constituted.
The Drover's Guide, by R. P. M. Short
(Watson, Ferguson). The sixth edition of
a publication invaluable to those concerned
in the movement of stock in Queensland.
Packed in a neat, strong wallet are maps
of Bananaland showing all stock routes,
Government bores and tanks; trucking yards
for pigs, sheep and cattle; border crossing
places for stock; main roads, railway lines
and a host of other information. Included
in the packet is a booklet containing the
schedules applicable to the N. S. Wales
regulations and relating to the introduction
of stock from Queensland. A very complete
guide.
Palmistry for Pleasure, by Dean Bryden
(Methuen). Here the reader can learn all
about the square hand, the spatulate hand,
the comic hand, the psychic hand and every
other kind of hand except a good one in
bridge. A chapter is devoted to the appli-
cation of palmistry to human problems, such
as mating and the training of children,
though the application of the palm in the
latter case is already widely known. The
book contains much contemplative matter for
the student of palms; it strengthens the
philosophy of the bachelor by assuring him
that “the absence of the girdle of Venus
increases the even calm of temperament,”
and warns the gad-about flapper that “the
man with square hands believes that a
woman’s place is in the home.”
Chinese Art, by R. L. Hobson (Benn).
This most artistically got-up book containing
100 plates in color reproducing the pot-
tery and porcelain of all Chinese periods,
together with jades, lacquer, paintings,
bronzes, furniture and other art media, will
be welcomed by all collectors and lovers of
objects of beauty. The plates are accom-
panied by brief notes of reference, and the
book itself introduced by an outline sketch
of Chinese art by Mr. Hobson, who is the
keeper of the Department of Ceramics and
Ethnography at the British Museum. “It
is a curious fact,” he remarks, “that, in
spite of 400 years of direct trade with China,
we Europeans are only beginning to-day to
understand the real nature of Chinese art.”
As a piece of propaganda in the interests
of celestial art this book should be a power-
ful stimulant.
Is Britain Overpopulated? by R. B. Kerr
(Kerr). “England,” says the author, “is
the most densely-populated country that ever
existed in the world, except a few small
islands like Bermuda and Barbadoes. Her
population per square mile is more than
twice that of Germany and nearly four times
that of France.” And still the population
grows rapidly in spite of war, birth-control
and emigration. It is two millions and a
quarter greater than it was in 1914. What
he describes as “one of the most enormous
evils” in this packed population is the great
surplus of women over men, and the pro-
lific breeding of the slum-dwellers compared
with the rest of the community. Meanwhile
the resources of England are dwindling.
The author offers no more original solution
of the problem than emigration and birth
control, with emphasis on the latter. Birth
control, he adds, has spread to every Euro-
pean country. “We used to hear of the
danger to France from a prolific Germany.
To-day the German birth-rate is almost as
low as the French; in the larger towns it
is actually lower.”
England, by Dean Inge (Berm). The
first edition of this work created so much
interest and aroused so much comment that
the publishers have now issued a cheaper
one to “enable a still larger public to enjoy
Dean Inge’s outspoken and brilliant analyses
of England to-day.” That the literary cleric
does not claim all his publisher does on his
behalf is quaintly admitted in a preface to
this new edition. “I do not quarrel,” he
remarks, “with the reviewer who described
‘England’ as ‘a rather creditable failure in
an impossible task.' ” On the subject of
his writing he adds: “The future, as regards
effective force and wealth, belongs to the
large countries which are not yet full of
people, and the natural resources of which
have not yet been completely tapped....
The prospect is favorable for the English
language, and not unfavorable for the
British race, but it is not favorable for the
Mother Country apart from its daughter
States, which may or may not be always
willing to support us as heartily as they
did in 1914. This relative decline in power
is a thing for which we must be prepared.
.... The next 50 years will be a very
critical time for England.”

“Lao-dah”: Australian Authors’ Week is
supposed to have been a success, but there
are plenty of writers who may think differ-
ently.. The popular notion is that if an
author sells a few, thousand copies of a work
he must be rolling in rude wealth. So he
might be if his book were published in Aus-
tralia. Usually his brain-child is launched in
Great Britain —-occasionally in America, His
publishers give him 15 to 20 p.c. royalties on
all copies sold outside his native land, but in
Australia he is lucky if he gets threepence a
vol. out of a six-shilling “colonial edition.” So
except for sentimental reasons his Australian
sales are a matter of indifference to him.
They wouldn’t be if his work were published
in Australia. So an Australian Publishers’
Week might be in order. It would get the
hearty co-operatioii of the authors.

VABIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
An Outing,
Since over range and river
Dies out the sunset glow,
And birds are westward winging,
No longer sweetly singing,
Let us, while daylight lingers,
Pack up and homeward go.
Though hither, thither straying,
All pleasant ’twas to wend
Down leafy ways and ferny,
Since we must towmward journey,
No use is there in grieving
For golden hours at end.
Though we must quit this Eden
For haunts of grime and smoke.
And feel the quitting hateful,
Let us at least be grateful
That we have had an outing
Denied to many folk.
While over range and river
Dies out the afterglow.
And birds, above us flying,
To nest and nook are hieing.
Let us, our camp-fire leaving,
Pack up and homeward go.

Sanctuary.
I walked to-day where elms and oak
Euroofed a quiet place ;
Where branches interlaced and arched
In living, Gothic grace,
And lsafy turrets tapered high
In tall serenity
Toward a rose-flushed evening sky
Of lapis lazuli.
Within its restful quietude
Was healing for the soul
As softly came the light aslant
From crimson aureole,
And, set within a paving lush,
Like altar steps, apart,
Grew little, soft-hued flower-buds
In tesselated art.
The sun-flecked ceiling, high above,
Was silvered filigree;
Dim cloisters stretched in vistas cool,
And gave their peace to me;
And fluting came a vesper hymn
From shady, wind-stirred eaves,
As, joyous-throated, sang a thrush
Among a wealth of leaves.
’Twas then my soul was lifted high
Upon the wings of praise,
For song-birds chanted vibrantly
In harmony’s rich maze
Of dulcet notes and cadences
And clear, melodic strains,
And carollings and trills and rills,
And muted, soft refrains.
And once there pealed a wondrous fugue,
A woven thing of love,
Which rose in modulations sweet
And filled the dome above;
And softly came a little breeze
And set the leaves astir
Above the joyous choristers
And one rapt worshipper.

LUCY HILL.
To an Easy Lover.
For love you have not given,
t And words you' did not say,
Your own heart may be riven
Some near unhappy day.
And in that day, my lover,
When all is far and fins
For me, T shall uncover
This sealed heart of mine.
This heart you might have broken
Had I not kept it fast
From love too lightly spoken
To be true love at last.
And in that hour, my lover,
If you have need of me.
The heart I shall uncover
Is yours for sanctuary.

The Hoad.
Down the road when w.s were young,
Eager for horizons new,
Light of heart and foot we swung,
Treading down the flowers that grew
Dew-fresh grass and shrubs amid:
Better sights the far hills hid!
From the tussocks larks arose
With a gentle w r hir of wings,
Till the limpid joy that flows
From their throat’s gay carollings
Filled the air. We passed along,
Scarcely heedful of their song.
Trees bent down their blossom-bossed
Branches, sweet with scents of spring;
Carelessly aside we tossed
Sprays the path encumbering.
Young adventure luring on,
W T ho will stay till it is done?
Up the road we toil again,
Stirring dust of memory,
Seeking, mostly all in vain,
For one lark once mpre to fly,
Merry-throated, on the. wing ;
For one flower’s blossoming!

HAMER.
The Old Drover.
Listless and slow
The old men go
To their cheerless haven.
Round the sombre eaves
Rustle the leaves,
And fierce winds raven.
One stays by the wall,
Shrunken and small,
In the autumn gloaming.
Does he hear the cry
Of the gulls as they fly,
Or the wild waves foaming?
Do the fading eyes
See mysteries
In the storm-wrack growing?
Or the sunset’s tire
On the far church spire?
Or the pale smoke blowing?
Once more he moves
Mid the drumming hooves
And the long horns’ rattle,
And his dull eyes gleam
As lie rides iii his dream
Round the racing cattle.
Withered and small
He sits by the wall.
To the gnarled old fingers
The grey head droops.
A warder stoops
To find why he lingers.
Not the warder’s hand,
Nor the waves on the sand,
Nor the grey gulls screaming,
Nor the fear-mad shout
Of the wind in rout
Shall break his dreaming.

My Love Is Dead.
My love is dead. Ring on, 0 bells,
Lest she who walks half-shyly down
The aisle my feet shall never tread
Should falter there. How 7 can she know
My love is dead?
Ring on, O bells that tolled for him,
For her who meets her lover now,
And. kneeling on that sacred spot
Where stood his bier, they take their vow.
E’rom out the church and through the town
They bore him to his resting place....
And she, dressed in her silken gown,
Turns to her ’groom her smiling face
And—God! What matters what they said
When my dear love is dead—is dead!

Realisation.
Like sudden sunlight striking through
Dark depths of tangled vine and tree,
When Trouble’s shadows fall on me
Returns again the thought of you,
Dispelling doubts and fears anew.
And then I know in very truth
All things are possible to Youth
And Love. My dear, because of you,
There is no limit to my strength,
No height to which my soul aspires
That I shall not attain at length;
No goal beyond my heart’s desires,
No dream but I can make it true,
For I am strong with thoughts of you!

The Warders of Our Coasts.
| The lone, wide, still seas,
The deep, strong, fierce seas,
Great seas,, like those which shattered
Pharaoh’s hosts —
1 The restless, raging, foam-tipped seas —
These be the Warders of our Coasts.
The thundering, sundering, vengeful seas;
The mighty, wind-swept, roaring seas ;
The coral reefs and the swirling tides,
The tropic calm and the freshening breeze,
And the isles where the dreaded cyclones
rise;
The surf-drenched headlands and the Storm
King’s hosts—
These and these be the Warders of our
Coasts.
The turquoise deeps and the sapphire seas,
And icy blasts that moan and freeze,
The beat of the surge on the lonely strand,
Near the havens where great ships lie at
ease—
These and these be the Watchers of our
Land.
The sun-kissed, sparkling, rolling seas,
The following, billowing, whelming seas
That guard our shores and keep them free,
That hold the Asian Fear afar,
And save our homes from fire and war —
The strong, untamed, unccmquered waves,
The pathless, all-protecting seas!
So, when the breakers roar and leap and
foam,
Hear we the Guardians of our Island Home!
The still, wide, lone seas,
The fierce, strong, deep seas,
Huge seas, the like which swallowed
Egypt’s hosts,
fine foaming, restless, raging seas—
These be the Warders of our Coasts !

BILLY HUGHES’S BETTER ’OLE.
W. M. Hughes’s speeches in the House of
Reps, nowadays are obviously relished by
the party which he left in 1917 and just as
obviously resented by the party to which
he has belonged ever since. They are the
kind of speeches he would have delivered as
a pledged Labor man in 1913 had 1927
conditions, generally speaking, existed then.
The member for North Sydney attacked the
Government on the score of its Common-
wealth Bank measure as if the form and
purpose of the institution, as established
by the Labor Government in which he was
Attorney-General, were sacrosanct. He de-
nounced the decision to sell the Common-
wealth Shipping Line, that frightfully ex-
pensive addition to the temple of Govern-
ment ownership, and thundered against
Inchcade in the approved Labor fashion.
Of Earle Page and the Government’s hand-
ling of the finances he spoke with rather
less respect than he showed for John
Forrest and his work in 1913-14, when
John Forrest was Joseph Cook’s Treasurer.
And in the debate on the renewal of the
waterfront war he recalled the fact that
he had been general secretary of the Wharf
Laborers’ Union and general president of
the Waterside Workers’ Federation, and re-
ferred to his former followers with under-
standing and sympathy. Naturally, an im-
pression has arisen that the gentleman would
be glad to go back to the old love if the
old love would have him.
This political remarriage is dismissed as
a humorous absurdity when discussed in
lobbies and refreshment-rooms, but really,
if it could be arranged, it would be a good
thing for all concerned. There is clearly no
future for Hughes as a Nationalist or
Liberal. He is sure of a seat as long as he
“behaves” in no-confidence debates and
general elections, but he will never be satis-
fied with anything short of the first place
in the party, and that place is securely held
by a younger and “safer” man. Even if
Bruce were out of the way, Hughes would
have to reckon with the hostility of Page’s
party. That party hates him so much—it
has certainly received ample provocation
—that it would never accept office in a
Hughes Government or guarantee to sup-
port it. And the Nationalists can’t afford
to alienate the Cockies, being without a
majority of their own.and having no chance
of getting one. So there is nothing ahead
of Hughes as a Nationalist but prolonged
and embittered isolation. He is really
wasted where he is, being a misery
to himself because of his negligible in-
fluence and thwarted ambition, and an
embarrassment to his associates. But back
in the Labor party he would not be wasted.
He could give his old crowd what it has
conspicuously lacked since 1917—leadership
and logic. In spite of all that can be said
against him he was a real leader and a
clear thinker, and during the last 10 years
Federal Labor has had neither leader nor
thinker—though, as a substitute for thought,
it has borrowed large slices of the policy
and rigmarole of Moscow. Under Hughes’s
direction it would become an Opposition
worthy of the name, and as such would
compel the Government to put forth all its
powers, instead of being a despised rabble of
freelances all saying different things. And
the man would be almost as useful to the
industrial side of “the movement.” It was
he who organised the maritime unions and
led them from one peaceful victory to an-
other until they could boast of being the
best-paid wharfies and seamen in the world.
He would never have committed the
criminal folly of wasting the fruits of vic-
tory and bringing disgrace upon unionism
and disaster upon the country by rushing
into a succession of lawless strikes.
❖ :Ji 'A- *
In short, Federal Labor needs Hughes,
and federated unionism needs him; and he
needs both. And because he could make
Labor something much better than it is
to-day, Australia needs him, too—needs him
back in his old place.
WHO KILLED BONDS?
The threatened liquidation of Bonds,
one of the biggest manufacturing concerns in
the Commonwealth, and run moreover with
the greatest consideration for the employees,
has been the subject of a newspaper inquest.
The management thinks Customs Minister
Pratten had a good deal to do with the
tragedy. Certainly the tariff seems to have
taken away from the stocking-makers with
one hand much of what it gave with the
other, and it delayed very necessary relief;
nevertheless the finger of suspicion points
at the Australian woman as the principal
culprit. There was a time when it was not
looked upon as cricket to blame women
for anything. They were regarded pityingly
as weaker vessels, irrational and irrespon-
sible creatures whose vagaries must be dis-
missed with a tolerant smile. To-day all
that is changed. Women demand equality
with men in every sphere. They have the
franchise and the right to sit in Parliament
and on the Bench; they have invaded the
office, the factory and the learned profes-
sions. Their “rights,” legal and social, are
being extended every year; but save per-
haps in the case of those strong-minded and
earnest souls who take the lead in feminist
movements, there is as yet very little sign
tliat women, taken in the mass, have
acquired any greater sense of national
responsibility than they possessed a hundred
years aeo.
*s* & tfc
Women are the shopping sex, and, mar-
ried or unmarried, they constitute the great
bulk of the customers at almost all classes
of retail stores. Women also, probably be-
cause their purse has been kept light, are
the bargain-hunters, no matter how much
money they may have to spend. Putting
price first, they very rarely trouble to
inquire, or care, whether the article is of
foreign, British or Australian origin. Men,
though still not sufficiently concerned, are
more concerned than that. Many of them
take a pride in the fact that their attire is
all Australian, and that the tobacco they
smoke, the- matches they strike and the
beverages they consume have meant jobs
for Australian wage-earners. Not only that,
but they are satisfied that they are getting
the best value for their money, though they
could, in many cases, buy imported articles
of inferior quality more cheaply. The
average housewife, called upon to choose
between Bonds’ stockings at 6s. lid., or
whatever the cheaper sorts cost, and a pair
from Yokohama at 2s. lid., will take the
Japanese article. Hence it comes about
that last year £1,968,941-worth of stockings
and socks and silk knitted apparel came
into this country from abroad. Hence it
comes about also that 1200 employees of
Bonds are gravely uncertain whether they
will have a job next month.
4t * * *
Yet The Bulletin has no brick to throw
at woman. In spite of what it has said,
it does not put man upon a pedestal and
declare him in this matter woman’s superior.
The simple explanation of the difference
between the two is that man, as the wage-
earner, has been mainly interested in help-
ing to increase jobs and wages, while woman
has been mainly interested in getting the
utmost possible for the man’s money. Those
whose business it is to get Australian goods
into Australian homes have not made a
sufficient appeal to woman in this matter.
It has not been often enough or clearly
enough put to her that preference to Aus-
tralian goods would put more money in
pay envelopes—that when she buys foreign
goods she gives some other country’s men
a living. Nine times out of ten she is in
most things the commonsense member of
the household where money is concerned,
and she knows quite well that if her friend
Mrs. Smith’s husband is a piano-maker
out of a job, every foreign piano that is
bought in this country will help to keep
him out of a job. The trouble is to get her
to make this a personal matter. In hun-
dreds of cases it will mean a struggle with
her old inclinations; but when she realises
that until she does her part the efforts made
to establish new Australian industries and
fill Australian purses can go for very little,
she will be a better citizen than she is
to-day.
THE ARTISTS FORM A UNION.
The immediate cause of the upheaval was
the bowl of goldfish in the now celebrated
portrait of J. Hones, Esq., the millionaire
tin-hare promoter. Artlovers looking at
that bowl, competently but not extraor-
dinarily well painted, can have no concep-
tion of the passions it once aroused. Only
a few months before Mr. Hones had sat for
his picture important changes had occurred
in the constitution of the Artists’ Union.
Originally founded by W. Walker-Walker,
a bad painter but a good organiser, the
union had lived a hand-to-mouth existence
for 10 years. Only a minority of artists
were members, and the sole amelioration of
their lot which they had yet obtained was
an award fixing a minimum price per square
foot of canvas covered.
Out of this award, however, grew the
need for differentiation. It was obviously
unfair that a member of a union who had
devoted his whole life to painting chrysan-
themums in pots should be robbed of his
reward by a fellow-unionist who mixed
still-life with figure work. Then it was
absurd that a portrait painter, working
comfortably indoors, probably with an elec-
tric radiator alongside him, should receive
the same remuneration as an outdoor-artist
who ran the risk of contracting painter’s
phthisis through exposure. Hence a number
of affiliated unions arose. Members were
broadly divided into figure, landscape, sea-
scape and still-life workers; but these main
divisions, it was discovered, were suscep-
tible of almost infinite subdivision. The
Association of Lacustrine Artists confined
itself to depicting lakes, ponds and dams,
Lake Alexandria and the Coorong being
specially excluded, as they contained a large
proportion of sea water. The Riverine
Artists, Incorp., depicted only those por-
tions of rivers, creeks and springs which
were above the influence of the tides; and
the Maritime Union confined itself to seas,
ships, wharves and estuaries.
With preference to unionists, which
quickly followed the federation of the
movement, painting ceased to be the absurd
spectacle of a solitary artist supposedly
struggling with his soul. Every landscape
painting required the presence of members
of at least two unions, the Land and Sky
Painters’ societies; and where the scene
was sufficiently diversified, as many as
six artists would turn up on the job. Under
these circumstances, of course, most pic-
tures had to be painted by contract, and
purchasers would sometimes be summoned
to decide whether a financial member of
the Animal Painters’ Union should be called
in to add a brace of cows which had strayed
into the field of vision.
Despite the gloomy prognostications of
non-union artists who fatuously called them-
selves “lovers of Truth” and were in turn
labelled scabs, unionism applied to art
resulted in an enormous boom. A pleasing
variety distinguished union-handled paint-
ings from those produced by non-union
labor. This was to be explained partly by
the fact that the sky painters would often
arrive on a job hours after the land painters
had departed, so that pictures would be
lighted from as many as three diffeient
bunion affairs were in this happy condi-
tion when Mr. Hones commissioned the
famous portrait mentioned above. Mr.
John Longstaff, of the Figure Painters’
Union received the contract for the hands,
head and feet; Mr. William Mclnnes of
the Drapery and Clothing Depicters Guild,
was to do the coat and trousers; Mr. Sep-
timus Power, of the Animal Artists Associ-
ation, got the goldfish; and Miss A. M. E.
Bale, of the Still-life Workers, was to execute
the bowl. Before the painting was finished,
however, Mr. Buckmaster, secretary
Riverine Painters, intervened. “How,” he
asked, “is Miss Bale to represent the bowl
without suggesting the water inside?” The
Federal executive immediately ordered all
work on the job to be suspended, and con-
vened a conference. Meantime, however,
a development had occurred which turned
the unions away from their strife. The
Spring Exhibition of Private Collectors'
was opened in Melbourne, and to the
annoyance of the unions, Mr. Hones’s por-
trait was hung complete, the bowl of gold-
fish having been finished by that plutocrat
himself. A general strike was immediately
declared. The Maritime artists picketed
all wharves, beaches and approaches to the
sea, and anybody remotely resembling an
artist was turned back, even if he only
wanted to have a dip. All pictorial repre-
sentation, in newspapers, on the stage and
in the home, was ruthlessly proclaimed
“black.” The country, deprived of the
release of art, gave itself up to the most
shameless materialistic excesses.
In the end it was agreed that the bowl
of goldfish should be scraped out and
repainted, and a new union, called the
Brotherhood of Painters of Objects Seen
through Glass, was given the job of record-
ing the water and the fish. The agreement
was signed by the trustees of Mr. Hones’s
estate. The" gentleman himself, worn out
with worry oyer his part in the affair, had
long since passed away, leaving his fortune
to the Church.
M. G. SKIPPER .
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Rich Man’s Son.
It was near the end of last century when
the Australian-born began to govern Aus-
tralia—that is to say, when the native-born
who were qualified to vote began to out-
number the imported people similarly quali-
fied. Shortly afterwards the country showed
preliminary signs of getting heavily into
debt through spendthrift habits. A probable
explanation is that the Australian-born had
been brought up to regard himself as a Rich
Man’s Son, and the sons of rich fathers, real
or imaginary, have a tendency towards
wasteful ways.
The great trouble is that this young
man’s rich inheritance is only rich if it is
worked assiduously; and even then it is
only rich in patches and in moderation.
Though it made its original boom
out of its mineral wealth, Australia now
produces 20 per cent, less in value per
inhabitant of that kind of wealth than very
ancient Britain does; and its average surplus
of products for export, measured by value,
is far behind that of Argentina, which is
little more than one-third its size. Without
abating its attitude as the careless son of a
Rich Father, Australia also set up as the
nephew of billionaire uncles. Quite apart
from war debts it has leaned on its uncles
to the extent of some 450 million pounds
since the beginning of the century.
The present situation verges on the ridi-
culous. Certain “workers,” or the men who
manage them, decided that the time had
arrived for general reduction of working
hours and production, accompanied, if pos-
sible, by general increase of pay. This came
on top of a lot of previous movements to
the same effect. Certain courts which were
established for the purpose of granting appli-
cations of the sort were applied to and
proved liberal in their concessions. The evi-
dent idea was that the value of the “illimit-
able natural resources” had increased
because the mortgage on them, and the
interest to be paid on the mortgage, had
grown immensely, and taxes had risen to a
pinnacle. The results have been extensive
and unanimous. Some thousands of railway
men have had to be dispensed with whether
they were really dispensable or not, for an
effort to cover extra costs somehow was
imperative. The Newcastle steelworks are
reducing their staff by 1000 at a time
because orders are unobtainable at a price
which will cover cost. The Newcastle wire-
netting works are liable to close also. All
this will make a vast reduction in the
demand for Newcastle coal. The shutting of
sundry Broken Hill mines goes to help the
effect. So does the shipping stoppage,
engineered to enforce “demands” which & re
not in the award. If success attends the
effort to hold up Mount Lyell, practically
the only copper-mine that the Common-
wealth has left will close, too.
The Rich Man’s Son is living at too fast
a rate. He demands a quart out of a pint
pot, and his present inclination, if nobody
will give him the quart, is to smash the pot.
thereby spilling the pint. Slogans are popu-
lar these days; but there is really only one
for Australia: “Come down to earth!”

The Federal-State Conflict.
N. S. Wales Industrial Commissioner
Pidmngton lately said that our Common-
wealth has the worst Federal Constitution
in the world, and if Russia is left out of
consideration the statement was about
right. The States may pass practically
any fool industrial legislation they
please tending towards the reduction of
employment and output and the con-
sequent restriction of exports; and as
a result there is a great surplus of
imports, which no tariff can keep out when
it is nullified by new industrial
law. They may borrow all they can
get and pledge the people’s credit without
limit. Instead of advertising that it won t


be responsible for its sons’ debts, the Com-
monwealth is making itself directly respon-
sible. It can’t stop borrowing abroad, or
pay interest abroad except out of loan
money, or create its promised sinking fund
abroad except by putting new borrowed
money into it, unless it vastly increases ex-
ports or vastly reduces imports. And, as
before remarked, every effort the Common-
wealth may make in either of those direc-
tions may be neutralised by the States.
As it is probably no use to preach to the
States a 52- or 56-hour week in order to
increase production, the alternative seems
to be either a complete removal of all in-
dustrial legislation and administration from
the States (which of course would mean an
amendment of the Constitution) or a policy
of absolute prohibition of dispensable im-
ports.
Should Doctors Kill?
“Macquarie Street”: Recent cases tried in
England have raised the question of the right
to end the sufferings of a hopelessly suffer-
ing patient. The unwritten law has been
pleaded in these cases, but as in all cases
in which this plea is raised the point is
missed that the law is unwritten mainly
because if it were written it would never
be passed.
Contributors to newspapers approach the
question of euthanasia in the spirit of
whether a doctor should be allowed to
kill incurable patients in order to save
them from lingering agony. There is a
very widespread idea that doctors do kill
in such cases and that they would do so
willingly in many more cases if they were
allowed by law. But it is not fear of
legal consequences alone that deters them.
There must be considered the patient, the
friends and relations of the patient, the
public, the religious beliefs and susceptibili-
ties of the patient, his relatives and the
community, the conscience of the execu-
tioner, and who or what authority shall
have the power and the responsibility of
ordering or approving the deed. We must
remember that death is very final, and
that the sentence once executed is not sub-
ject to review. Apart from questions of
religion and conscience, and granting that
legislation can confer the right to kill,
with whatever safeguards can be invented,
on whom is the duty to kill to be placed
and what authority is to approve the
sentence? Moreover, the “incurable” dis-
ease of to-day may be curable to-morrow.
The consent of relatives would frequently
be followed too late by doubts and remorse.
As a matter of fact, the amount of suffer-
ing entailed in dying of chronic and incur-
able diseases is exaggerated. Cancer is
painful in only its later stages; chronic
heart and kidney disease appear to cause
great distress, but the brain is poisoned or
its circulation so impaired that the sufferer
is largely unconscious of the symptoms.
The skilful use of narcotic drugs reduces
suffering to an enormous extent. I deliber-
ately say that there is more suffering caused
by an exposed nerve in a tooth, by ear-
ache, by an abscess under a corn, by more
serious conditions such as gallstones or a
large burn than by any of the incurable
chronic diseases.

Foreign v. Docal Loans.
Another pot of gold has been found at the
tail of the rainbow. There has existed for
the past two years a complicated agree-
ment by which the British Government, in
the hope that it may get rid of some spare
population, offers to advance 34 millions
to these States at half the current interest
for five years, two-thirds interest for an-
other five years, and full interest for the
rest of time. To make things easy for the
States the Commonwealth also agrees to
help with the interest, but there isn’t much
in that except an evidence of the Federal
Government’s habit of meddling with State
business and neglecting its own. The Com-
monwealth is simply the States combined,
and when the importing boom and Customs
revenue slacken, it will probably have to
put some more taxes on the State peoples
to get out of its own b°l e - N. S. Wales,
which has hitherto avoided the mixed agree-
ment, is now going in, and Minister Butten-
shaw, who is a sort of Associate-Premier,
is reported as follows:
“From the Migration Agreement we will
get money for developmental works. I have
decided to earmark a substantial sum for
the construction of the Wyangale Dam, the
first step in the great Lachlan water conser-
vation scheme. The Lachlan water conser-
vation scheme will cost nearly £2,000,000.
When it is completed a million acres of rich
country can be settled. With the Lachlan
water conserved the Government wall open
up the great mallee belt of 800,000 acres in
the direction of Mount Hope. This area
alone, it is estimated, will carry 600 settlers.”
N. S. Wales has been in the irrigation
business for a good many years at great
cost, and the area irrigated in 1925-26 was
83,795 acres (vide Australian Production
Statistics). The proposed settlement is a
long way from the sea, and freights are
rising. And even if the State gets a reduc-
tion of interest for 10 years, it will prob-
ably be paying the full rate before there
are any returns from the scheme, and re-
turns will probably be disappointing when
they come.
The wdiole plan, with its gilding of charit-
able aid, is only another addition to the
staggering external debt which makes so
much trouble because the interest has to
be paid with gold, or with surplus exports
which can be turned into gold; and both
have wholly ceased to be available. A local
loan at 5 per cent, is really cheaper than an
external one at 2 per cent., for the interest
remains here and the State immediately
begins to take it back in taxation, while
the fellow abroad doesn’t pay us taxes.

A Shadow Over Maoriland.
Maoriland is a country where, fortunately
for the politicians perhaps, very little
interest is taken in politics. Fifteen years
ago, when the issue between the towns folk
and the country folk was in doubt —they
called them Liberals and Reformers, but
neither label fitted—there was a good deal
of feeling, but it has died down. The people
of the Shaky Islands have accustomed
(hemselves to the notion that the cocky,
being, as he himself modestly admits, the
backbone of the country, ought to have the
right to govern. The backbone in this case
consists of less than 10 per cent, of the
carcase, but it has packed around it all
the Conservative and anti-Labor sentiment
in the small Dominion, and, aided by a 28
per cent, loading of the value of rural
votes, it prevails.
Up to date the result has been an Adminis-
tration neither better nor worse than the
average of those that preceded it. It has
attempted to help the cocky in various
directions, but it has not succeeded to any
marked degree, which is perhaps why
its pro-cocky activities are not very bitterly
resented in other quarters. For the rest it
has carried on the programme of public
works and development originated in the
days of Seddon and Ward, borrowing
copiously for the purpose and spending
about nine-tenths of the money in the
North Island, where most of the Reform
Ministers and members haye seats.
Under this arrangement the “solid South”
paradoxically has both lost and gained.
It loses population to the North —each year
its gain is less than the natural increase,
the balance of births over deaths—but it
gets richer and richer, and attempts to
induce it to kick against what looks like
an unfair division of expenditure meet with
stolid indifference. A very large proportion
of South Island railways, roads, bridges
and public buildings were finished and
paid for before the abolition of provincial
governments. As a self-contained entity the
South Island could get along with about a
fifth of the national tax revenue it is at
present providing, and it would be able to
reduce rates in rural counties and boroughs
because it would have the full use of its
own contributions towards funds devoted
tc road subsidies—now mostly spent in the
North Island.
Separation is not a political issue at pre-
sent, though the matter is now and then
discussed, but it keeps cropping up with
increasing frequency and may one of these
days provide the islanders with a great deal
of excitement. So long as loan money
is plentiful it will be spent in the North
Island and hoarded in the South, thus
stabilising matters; but if evil days come
in which John Bull shall declare the pawn-
shop closed, necessitating some more twists
of the taxation screw, the Fernlanders are
likely to have an inter-island scrap on their
hands.

The City of Dreadful Muddle.
“The public be damned!” has been for so
long the motto of the Sydney City Council
that it will be quite a shock to the popula-
tion if the Commissioners appointed by the
Bavinshaws should remember that they
are the servants of the public and act
accordingly.
The footpaths of a city were designed
that people might walk thereon with some
reasonable degree of security; but for years
the footpaths of Sydney have been regarded
primarily as conveniences for builders,
window-cleaners and plumbers, and the
myrmidons of the Post Office, the Gas Co.,
and the drainage, road-repairing and electri-
city departments. To take a walk down
George-street or Pitt-street is to run a
gauntlet of barricades, excavations, ladders,
scaffoldings and rock-drills. The men who
are erecting a new verandah for Ploop and
Co., whose portico was carried away by a
motorist who dreamed he was alone on
Maroubra track, have laid out piles of
corrugated-iron on the footpath, occupying
most of the rest of the space with ladders.
A few yards further on the alterations to
Woop and Sons’ shop front are proceeding in
a fashion that forces pedestrians into the
roadway, where they run the risk of being
treated like the pivotal verandah-post of
Ploop and Co. Another few yards and a
detour has to be made to allow a gang of
plumbers to sort out scores of lead pipes.
A few more yards, and there is a gang
tearing up a perfectly good asphalt pave-
ment so that it may be relaid in concrete
or flags or wood blocks. In the next block
the gas men are re-laying a main, and have
railed off a trench 50ft. long. In civilised
cities when it is necessary to tear up a
footpath the various departments co-
ordinate, the job is done at night, and the
public doesn’t know anything about it. In
Sydney the water and sewurage men, though
they are employed by the same board, are
liable to separately tear up the same foot-
path within a few weeks of one another.
And it isn’t only pedestrians that are
affected. One of the commonest of Sydney
sights is a gang of 70 or 80 men making
excavations on a tramway line. Every
two or three minutes a tram comes along
and operations have to be suspended. All
traffic on the roadway is congested and
hampered, the work crawls on at a snail’s
pace, and the only folk who are really
happy about it are the honest lads who get
a day’s pay for a quarter of a day’s work.
Why Tasmanians Leave Home.
Dear Bulletin, —No doubt many Tas-
manians leave home because the larger
States offer more opportunities and attrac-
tions (B. 10/11/’27). And it is the Federal
laws that are mainly responsible, because
their results tend to attract our workers to
the mainland factories, which factories are
made possible by the Federal tariff. Then
the Courts fix wages for Tasmania at the
same rate as for Australia, or even higher,
forgetting that we have to sell our pro-
ducts in the larger centres of the mainland
and pay a heavy transport impost. This
has caused the practical extinction of our
timber industry, heretofore one of our
best.
But a decreasing population does not
necessarily mean that this State is stag-
nating. One has only to go into our
country districts to see signs of progress.
Our fruit centres show much bush land
being cleared and many fresh plantations.
Our farming and potato lands are well
tilled and look extremely prosperous. Rural
Tasmania is sound; but rural industiy is
handicapped by its labor costs and the
political recognition of a so-called “living
wage.” I am not suggesting that wages
are too high, but I do say they can only
remain at a level v’ ich the country can
earn.
Many changes have taken place since
we formed up as a Commonwealth, and,
being the smallest State, Tasmania has felt
the growing-pains first; but Australia has
difficulties right ahead, and it is just a
question whether she has had sufficient
prudence to provide against disasters such
as have caught Tasmania and are now
being surmounted by its rural population.
In any case, Tasmania is sound, and Aus-
tralians will be prouder yet of their small
sister, because her beauty increases with
her growth.—Yours, etc., T. Murdoch.

The Law and the Gun.
Spurred by the recent revelation of the open
issue of firearms to northern strike pickets,
the Queensland Government has passed a
bill regulating their sale, purchase and
possession. All persons having concealable
firearms must report them and take out a
license. Similarly, buyers and sellers must
observe certain forms.
Unless the Act is rigidly administered it
may be as futile as the N.S.W.. legisla-
tion to the same effect. That has proved
quite useless in keeping the lethal weapons
out of the hands of undesirables, probably
because penalties for infringements have
been farcical, for the most jiart, and be-
cause the enforcement of the law has been
lax in the extreme. Nearly eveiy pawn-
broker’s window in Sydney is a small arsenal
of concealable firearms, most of them the
cheap Belgian and American automatics
affected by crooks. There seems to be little
check on the sale or purchase of these, and
if Ikey asks the dubious-looking gentleman
who wants to pop his “gun” where his
license is, the dubious gent is more than
likely to take his pizness to the less par-
ticular rival next door. The same may be
said of the person who wants to buy one of
the pledged articles. Who’s going to hurt
his feelings by talking of licenses if he has
the money?
The reputable weapon dealers are right
enough in this respect, but a keener watch
on the pawnbroker and the second-hand
trafficker is necessary.
Disappointment in Perdition.
Dear Bulletin, — I dissent from the view
of the Austrian Government’s comparative
innocence in the matter of the Great War,
as expounded by the writer of “Laughter
in Hell” (B. 24/11/’27). Austria was crav-
ing for a successful war. Its prestige was
at the lowest. Save for the bloodless steal
of Bosnia and Herzegovina (19,700 sq.
miles) in 1878 and 1908, it had gained no
provinces for many years, and it had lost
heavily. It had been thrown out of Ger-
many and Italy after dominating both,
sometimes in name and sometimes in reality,
for centuries. It had “lost face” by its
utter failure to protect its ally, the Pope.
It had a dreadful record for losing battles.
Ports were scarce, especially after the losses
in Italy, and the desire for Salonika became
an obsession. Serbia was in the way to
Salonika; and. besides, an independent
Serbia was a dango’-, as it attracted the
Serb subjects of the empire. An indepen-
dent Roumania was the same kind of
danger. Austria hadn’t a colony to its
name. It was hated by a vast number of
its subjects, which was bad, and it was
despised by a great many, which was worse.
There is abundant reason to suspect that
the crime of Sarajevo, where an Austrian
prince was assassinated on Austrian soil
by an Austrian subject of Serbian extrac-
tion, was stage-managed from Vienna.
Through Imperial pig-headedness the prince
seems to have become a danger. He was
to be emperor, but his non-royal Bohemian
wife was not to rank as empress but rather
as a sort of concubine, and his sons were
to be cut out of the succession. There
was no cause for wonderment if suspicion
arose that he was conspiring to break up
the ant-eaten empire, in which he only had
a life interest, and to provide his descend-
ants with hereditary dominions in Bohemia
and Hungary. The sacrifice of this spare
archduke supplied the chance to subjugate
Serbia and clear the rqad to Salonika, also
the road to fame and prestige.
Unsuccessful Austria had every reason
which brilliantly successful Germany had
not to seek a cheap and lucky war, but it
selected the wrong war. Ultimately, both
dissolved into their component parts, but
Austria had more component parts than
Germany, so it dissolved more.—Yours,
etc., Henry Horsecolear.

The Catch in It.
In these days, when the Russian Govern-
ment comes along with a proposal for the
establishment of a basis of mutual agree-
ment and good faith between itself and its
European neighbors, the latter are apt to
follow the example of the Hebrew who sus-
piciously examined a proffered cigar and
asked what was the matter with it. The
suggestion of the Muscovite bandar log is
that the nations should join in a total dis-
armament. There is to be not a wholesale
reduction in armaments, but a total aboli-
tion of them. Everything connected with
war, from the line-of-battleship to the last
gaiter button, is to be scrapped. Then the
empty-handed nations will be able to
proffer, by their mutual renunciation of
the materials of war, absolute proof of
their sincerity. Anyone wishing to start
anything after that would have to rely on
his teeth and nails.
War is most horrible; but that fact must
not stop us from considering this proposi-
tion both fore and aft. Russia, ostracised
and cut off from any present chance of self-
rehabilitation, is practically penniless. It
is a military axiom in Europe that the
Muscovite’s huge military organisation
mostly consists of cannon fodder, and badly
trained and fed cannon fodder at that. The
army organisation is a farce, and the forces
have no armament or munitions to fit them
to face any of the modernised armies of
Western Europe; and while the country
is too impecunious to purchase these all-
important adjuncts of successful warfare, it
has even less hope of manufacturing them
itself.
A universal total disarmament on the
lines suggested by the Soviet would thus
be right into Russian hands. It would
remove Russia’s greatest handicap against
the might of neighboring races, and war-
fare would once more resolve itself into a
mass scramble in which the teeming hordes
of Russia would regain the advantages
which their Tartar ancestors once attained,
and for the same reason —vast weight of
brute force against a foe which had a
lesser degree of the same commodity to
oppose to it, and no ingenious mechanical
devices to offset its inferiority in numbers.
It is interesting to note that Germany is
also in the field at Geneva with a proposal
for a reduction of armaments. Though in
much better case than Russia, Germany will
be weakened militarily for many a long
day to come. The nearer she can bring her
neighbors to her own level while time is
gained for fresh preparations the better.
It is unlikely that any of the European
Powers will accept the naive proposals of
either Russia or Germany. Indeed, they
dare not do so, since to comply would be
tantamount to casting themselves bound to
the tiger.

Dear Bulletin,—You are right in advocat-
ing a minimum sentence for assaults on the
police. A maximum sentence for this and
many other crimes is not required—a savage
or unjust one could, and would, be promptly
reduced, either on appeal or by the Execu-
tive, whereas in the case of an absurdly
insufficient sentence there is no way of in-
creasing it unless the defendant is foolish
enough to appeal.—Yours, E.S.W.
“G.M.”: My conservative old Alma Mater
will never give an Australian a job if it can
get an Englishman almost as good. A new
Professor of English was wanted to replace
Prof. Wallace, who has gone from Mel-
bourne to Sydney. There were eight Aus-
tralian and eight English applicants. R. C.
Bald, a brilliant Melbourne graduate, now
teaching English at the Adelaide Uni., aged
26, was beaten for the billet by G. 11.
Cowling, from Leeds, aged 45. although
they were equal in attainments. The barring
of Australians from the higher posts in their
own Universities has wrought much harm
for years past; it has not only discouraged
our best students, but it has given an
impression far and wide that Australian uni-
versities are second- or third-rate institu-
tions incapable of producing teachers. There
is also an implied reflection on Australians..

Another anomaly about arbitration needs
attention. The union that makes the
loudest threats of strike gets the best deal.
Judges bow r to truculence, and union leaders
act accordingly. A case in point concerns
the Australian Tramway Employees’ Associ-
ation. Its last award expired on December
31, 1924. and ever since it has been trying
to get a new award; but the matter has
been sidetracked to make room for bully-
ing unions. To the credit of the A.T.E.A.
a mass meeting of members declined to even
consider a strike as a protest; but it leaves
a nasty taste in many a mouth.

"McLeura” : In an article on “Why Diseases
Go Unchecked” (B. 24/11/’27) the writer
pointed out that, notwithstanding the pro-
vision in our v.d. laws that cases should
be reported to a public health authority,
the disease is not watched closely enough.
In many instances, knowing a medical man
is required to furnish this report, the per-
son wanting treatment chooses a quack—
and secrecy. In England the usual notices
in public lavatories include in conspicuous
type the address of the nearest clinic and
an assurance that the patient will not be
asked to give name or any other personal
particulars.

POLITICAL
POINTS
In pre-Arbitration days when men struck
they took a chance of losing something—they
might have to go back on worse terms.
Nowadays, as soon as a big body goes on
strike, mostly to get something that Arbi-
tration won’t give them, the usual busy-body
proposes that they shall go back on the old
terms, their claims to be afterwards inquired
into. So long as men risk losing nothing and
always have a good chance of gaining some-
thing, of course they will strike. Who
wouldn’t?
An amusing feature of the . waterside
workers’ irritation strike was the insistence
on the fact that they were always “ready
to negotiate.” Award wages are 2s. lljd.
per hour for ordinary day work, 4s. 3d. to
5s. per hour for night work, and up to
9s. 3d. per hour for holiday toil. It wasn’t
proposed to negotiate about honestly observ-
ing the award and doing the work, but
about how much should be added to the pay
by way of blackmail, in return for which
work would resume until the next stoppage
and the next blackmail. The last blackmail,
in the shape of a rise of wages following a
strike, began to be paid in February, 1927,
so the broken peace doesn’t stay mended
long.
The late N.S.W. Labor Government
knocked four hours off the working week
on the railways and tramways, shoved up
workers’-compensation costs and ordered the
Commissioners to find 3 p.c. on wages and
salaries (the total is constantly increasing)
for child endowment. The same burdens
were imposed on those from whom the
Commissioners buy coal, trucks, refreshment-
room supplies and a host of other things,
together with another sixpence on the State
income-tax. By way of getting some of the
vast additional revenue required, train and
tram fares have been increased. And people
are blaming, not the fools who plunged the
railway and tramway finances into chaos, but
the Government which has to cope with the
consequences.
Victoria’s bilious Upper House has been
in its worst mood since the A Hancocks went
out and the Hogans came in. It has thrown
out or hung up every important measure
save one, and over taxation matters it lin-
gered as if the deficit .was a myth. And the
inexperienced Hogan Ministry has allowed
both friends and opponents to talk too
much. Still, it is trying hard to get the
Totalisator Bill and the Outer Ports Bill
through. The latter is half a century past
its time, and it is thought that even the
most apoplectic Leg. Council will hesitate
to monboy with it.
A bit of land in George-street, Sydney, with
a building of no remarkable value on it,
was sold the other day for £140,000. It
measures 49ft., so of course it is taxed by
the Commonwealth, and will now be. taxed
more, by reason of the new price, on the
plea that it is one of the “great estates”
which ought to be broken up. To evade
the impost, which measures “great estates”
solely by value, the 49ft. would have to be
cut into more than 20 allotments. That
being impossible, the owners take the only
available course and add the tax to the cost
of living.
Britain and Germany are just completing
arrangements for the mutual abolition of
passports. This is the last of a whole chain
of similar arrangements. Only Australia
stands out. Of course all sorts of explana-
tions are offered, but the real reason is that
politicians will do more for votes in Aus-
tralia than anywhere else, and are more
afraid of abolishing unnecessary jobs and
billets.
MORE TIN HARES.
“The overseas and inter-State shipping interests charge the unions with, among other things, refus-
ing to work cargo in the presence of police or a foreman.”
THE “ FRIEND OF THE WORKING MAN”: “He re, copper, hop it, and give the hoys a run
for their money.”
The story of the hold-up of the Katoomba
at Fremantle proves very simple. Some in-
toxicated mariners came back to the ship
late and demanded dinner. As the award
prohibits the cooks boiling the mid-day meal
after one o’clock, nothing was forthcoming.
So, because the cooks refused to break the
award, the vessel was held up, and if they
had broken the award that would probably
have been a worse grievance. The Seamen’s
Union, whose imported Walsh and Johan-
son rage exceedingly, endorsed the strikers’
action, probably without troubling to ask
what the row was really about.
An enactment which would help to clear
up the industrial situation would be one
providing that no union or union official
shall have power to line, suspend or expel
any unionist except for an act which is
contrary to the award. In addition, the
finee should have an easy apneal to the law
if he is prepared to argue that his doings
didn’t constitute a breach of the award, and
the maximum amount of the monetary pen-
alty should be defined by f statute. Of late
years the air has become thick with union
rules and regulations, all tending to restrict
the doing of work, and the fines are calcu-
lated to make a serious hole in the wages of
any serf who falls under suspicion of energy
or activity.
A return called for by Paterson, the Min-
ister for Markets, explodes the yarn that the
Commonwealth Shipping Line has done won-
ders in the way of keeping down freight
rates on produce exported to the ILK. A
few comparisons:—
Australia. Maoriland.
Wool . . . . 1.06 c!. lb. l.Old. lb.
Mutton . . .. Id. lb. l.Olld. lb.
Lamb .. .. lid. lb. I.lBd. lb.
Beef .. .. fd. lb. O.Sld. lb.

Veal . . . . Id. lb. O.Sld. lb.
Pork .. . . l td. lb. o.Bld. lb.
And Maoriland hasn’t chucked away seven
or eight millions in trying to run job-con-
trolled steamers.
Customs-Minister Pratten is sorry, it
seems, that stocking manufacture and some
other textile branches show signs of going
to pot, and lie regrets the collapse in the steel
industry. Still, looking back on his Govern-
ment’s efforts, his conscience is clear, and he
disclaims all responsibility. The fact is that
when the Federal Court or some such body
has put £1 more of new burden on some
industry than it can bear, the Government,
after deliberation, has come along with ss.
worth of tariff assistance. It treats industry
as a criminal with previous convictions, and
gives it the benefit of the doubt with reluct-
ance. The essential point is that through
surplusage of imports Australia wanted about
£52.800,000 of external loan money in
1926-27, and is likely to want £74,000,000
this year to balance its accounts. It is the
business of Pratten and Co. to deal with this
fatal condition of things, and not to white-
wash themselves. If a general who occupied
a commanding position comes back to say
that he has lost it, it isn’t much good for him
to disclaim responsibility.
Minister Jones had to handle Vic. Uppah
Chambah very gently to get its sanction for
the Income-tax Bill providing for increases
of Id. in the £ on personal exertion and 2d.
on property and companies. Aided by Frank
Clarke, Russell Clarke and others, he had
one vote to the good on a division to ask the
Assembly to reduce the rate on property. On
another division to lower the company rate
from Is. 6d. to Is. 4d. the Government won
by three votes. So one awkward fence has
been cleared.
The Queensland Government’s solicitude
for the pastoralist has had such an airing
that astonished sheepmen were beginning
to think there might be something in it.
They came back to earth when Premier
McCormack introduced a bill to extend the
operation of the super land-tax, which was
due to expire by effluxion of time, explaining
that he couldn’t possibly remove any taxa-
tion at present. In other words, though not
McCormack’s, money has to be found some-
how to pay the unemployment dole and pro-
vide for the huge Government pay-roll, and
the. pastoralist can be bled for the money,
while his vote doesn’t count.
For some time the British woman has had
a limited vote, but it is now proposed to
put her on an equality with mere man. Then
it is reckoned that she will outnumber him
by 2| million suffrages, and a Cabinet of
Ladies will come within the bounds of possi-
bility. Universal suffrage is an interesting
experiment in a country where woman pre-
dominates so largely.
Labor-member Fenton, in demanding
that the expenditure on the Army, already
dangerously reduced, should be cut down
still more, got off a decayed gag to the
effect that “in any case of trouble we can
rely on the decision and the aptitude of
our own people.” That is to say, a volun-
tary amateur mob, led by anybody and
armed with any old thing. History is very
silent about campaigns in which the rabble
host, minus organisation, plans, commis-
sariat and everything else, made a show
against real soldiers. Even men accustomed
to using weapons in desultory warfare but
otherwise ill-trained have failed badly. To
go no further than England for an example,
Queen Boadicea led that kind of force in
heroic style and overwhelming numbers, and
came to wholesale disaster.
The Vic. Tote Bill is having a fairly
smooth passage in the Leg. Assembly,
though its fate in the other House is doubt-
ful. Analysing the position in the other
States, Chief-Sec. Prendergast said that
Government receipts from the tote last year
were £233,800 in N.S.W., £84,500 in S.
Aus., £07,000 in Queensland, £54,500 in
Westralia and £21,870 in Tas. Westralia
is the ( only . State with proper “straiglitout”
and “place” (equal-division) machines, a
system which yields the greatest proportion-
ate revenue and is the best for the backer.
But the deductions are such that the tote is
really not getting a fair spin anywhere; ex-
cluding fractions and unclaimed divs., they
amounted last year to 124 p.c. in Westralia,
S. Aus. and N. S. Wales, 13J p.c. (city)
and 15 p.c. (country) in Queensland, and
15 p.c. in Tas. Even 10 p.c., the Ilogan
proposal, will give McShortodds a big ad-
vantage.
“Rote Fahne”: Federal Labor members
must have changed their repertoire since
going to Canberra if they don’t sing “The
Red Flag” in the party rooms, as was
angrily asserted last week. At Spring-
street, Melbourne, the dreary dirge was
often heard by people stealing through the
corridors in the early hours. Another fav-
orite was “I Love My Boss,” which verged
upon the blasphemous. Perhaps “Texas”
Green has brought some new ones into the
bill since his return from the U.S.A.
The twenty-blankth explanation of why
Germany lost the war is furnished in a book
by a member of the General Staff. He says
the. troops were disgusted by the brutality of
their officers, and as the officers’ modes of
reproof included severe caning and slapping,
also spitting in the face, there is something
to be said for this view. Still the officers
of Frederick the Great caned much more
ferociously, and they were unrivalled spit-
ters, both for quantity and distance. Yet
Frederick won all his wars. One reason
why the Huns failed was that their opponents
disliked them so intensely and were willing to
take unlimited risks to show it.
Any old strike or work stoppage in Aus-
tralia is liable to find somebody who is
“affiliated with Moscow” rushing to lend a
hand, and he doesn’t always wash the hand
before he lends it. The Soviet concern is
a fraudulent bankrupt on a huge scale, and
an incessant cadger for more loans, and it
has a gift of abusive correspondence which
was once fresh but is now muddy and flat.
In addition, it wears in the mass a Doffiain-
dossing and second-hand look which implies
lack of “lawful visible.” The bosses, how-
ever, are rich enough. Wherefore upheav-
alists here and elsewhere, who are worth
very littl.e in the labor market, wave the Red
flag with intensity, and picture themselves
as also dwelling in marble halls.
THE FEUDISTS,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The flagellation of Mr. Lang by his one-time
colleague Mr. Mutch was keenly enjoyed by everyone
on the Ministerial side of the N.S.W. Assembly and
by not a few on the Opposition side as well.”
Tilings are mostly unexciting where the Ins
and Outs are lighting
Their interminable battle over legislative
bones;
Members, lounging, yawning, sprawling, list
with apathy appalling
To some dreary disquisition couched in
unimpressive tones.
But the weariest convention springs to
eager, brisk attention,
Even bored reporters hasten to get every
sentence down,
When Bill Smith arrays for forces all his
language’s resources
To convey his frank opinion of his old
associate Brown.
When they’ve been old mates and brothers
Obviously they know each other’s
Villainies with wealth of detail
Only given to kin and kith.
And you feel a kind of wonder
Hearing Smith tear Brown asunder
What disclosures Brown will retail
When he starts dissecting Smith.
Comrade, rede for me the whence-ness of
this atmospheric tenseness.
Why are ears by scores a-straining lest a
single word they miss?
Some momentous vote of censure occupies
them, peradventure?
Only glowing rhetoric surely casts a spell
on men like this?
Nay, when party feud estranges and when
love to hatred changes,
There’s a piquancy in any disillusioned
soul’s harangue....
’Tis but Tommy Mutch revealing, in impas-
sioned terms and feeling,
His unbowdlerised impressions of his
ancient cobber Lang.
When who once were comrades closest
Come to bandy insults grossest,
Each the other’s failings touches
With a firmer, surer touch.
Mutch on Lang unkindly dancing
Proved sufficiently entrancing.
There may be some purpler patches
When it’s time for Lang on Mutch.

“Hayband”: When Brumby joined up m
1915 his mutes decided to give him a parting
gift, and the hat went round. Those who
suggested a wristlet watch were over-ruled
in favor of a proposal to hand over the sum
collected and “let Brum do what he
well likes with it.” A stout leather purse
was purchased, and, partly on the strengch
of being Brum’s mate and partly because
he had himself been twice rejected, Blue
was detailed to make the presentation, llie
mob and its girl were there to say good-bye
to Brum, who admitted afterwards that lie
“didn’t think there were so many people m
the flamin’ distrie’.” Blue stood up. He
was unused to the limelight, and his nervous-
ness almost deprived him of the power of
speech. The crowd cheered ironically and
that made him worse. He hemmed and
stammered and the only sentence that was
audible was, “Here, take the thing.
Blue’s speech is still quoted in the district
as a model of straight-flung English when-
ever presentations are being arranged.

“Lao-dah”: Cabled that English people
who attended the ceremony at the tomb of
the Unknown Soldier in Paris this year
wearing poppies for remembrance were
hurt and puzzled to find the flower caused
them to be regarded with suspicion by gen-
darmes and scowls by French citizens. They
made, in fact, the rather belated discovery
that a red flower in the buttonhole lias quite
a different significance on the continent of
Europe from what it has in Britain. On
May Day in Paris and other capitals the
communist sallies out with a red geranium
in his lapel and the anti-communist issues
forth wearing a white ditto. The business of
the police, plus soldiers, machine-gun squads,
armored-car sections and aeroplanists, is to
keep the two apart. The chances are that
the poppy will get less popular in France
instead of more so.

“Merris” : “Henry Horsecollar” isn’t quite
accurate in his par (B. 17/11/27) about
the Dead Sea. According to Colonel Preston
in “The Desert Mounted Corps,” it was the
Germans, not the Turks, who carried on some
naval operations here. ' Their craft were
motor-boats, which towed grain-barges to the
northern extremity of the Defunct Fluid,
whence the grain was transported by road
and rail to the Turkish Army. It was partly
to stop this traffic that Allenby, after the
fall of Jerusalem, decided to extend his line
to the Jordan. When the Light Horse
reached Rujm el Bahr, on the Dead Sea, they
found one of these motor-boats tied up at the
jetty. This they seized and, mounting a
machine-gun in its bows, the happy warriors
put to sea and captured or sank the rest
of the fleet. The captured boats were after-
wards handed over to the Navy and the Dead
GONE.

“P.X.” : Other people besides, the shearer
scurry through the mulga and saltbush in
motor-cars. A few days ago a party of rab-
biters called at our place. They were in a
moth-eaten Buick which looked as though
it had done 90,000 miles on its ear. There
were, as far as I could count, seven of them
—four buck abos., one lubra and a couple of
piccaninnies. They work on contract, haye a
good reputation for cleaning up things
thoroughly and make good money. They
weren’t after tucker or anything of that sort
—they wanted papers! But the car isn’t
entirely a blessing out back. Or perhaps it
is. Anyway, there’s a little township I
know that hasn’t been able to support a
butcher’s shop since most of the few inhabi-
tants acquired cars. And the three or four
big sheep-owners in the neighborhood can t
remember selling them any mutton either.
“Verri” : I happened to be in a city shop
the other day when a young woman was
arrested for shop-lifting. As she was led
away weeping by one of the shop-detectives
the sympathies of other shoppers were con-
centrated on her two children, a child of four
and a baby. After the suspect’s bags and
parcels had been examined, in a private
room, she was taken to the police-station.
At this stage the elder child, who was being
looked after by the office staff, set up a wail
to be taken home to her mother, who wasn t
the woman the police had removed. Further
investigation revealed that both the children
were borrowed, it being part of the shop-
lifter’s scheme to offer to mind _ children for
working mothers and then utilise them for
her own ends. The plan had worked suc-
cessfully several times with small shop-
keepers unwilling to prosecute for petty lar-
ceny a woman with two tiny children, but
when the lady sought larger spheres she
found a cold and unsympathetic organisation
awaiting her.

“Mako”: There doesn’t seem much reason
to doubt the Wolf’s statement that she flew
a seaplane over Sydney. The M.L. Govern-
ment refused to believe that the raider hac<
flown her seaplane off Farewell Spit to sow
mines, but the subsequent loss of the Port
Kembla there verified the statement. The
Wimmera went down as the result of the
northern minefield sown by the same craft,
and when the mine-sweepers were operating
off the M.L. coast a couple of years ago they
found further evidence to support the Wolf s
story. But it is doubtful if the Wolf ever
intended to drop bombs on Sydney; that
morning flight was more ill the nature of
bravado. Her job was mine-sowing.
* * *
“Runa” : No need to go to London to find
a crowd -which returns stolen jewellery (B.
l/12/’27) ; Sydney has as good a record.
When a thief the other day thrust his hand
through a Hunter-street shop-window and
extracted a velvet stand thickly studded with
diamond rings, the luncheon-hour crowd
sized up the situation and enthusiastically
gave chase. The harassed ring : snatcher, find-
ing the pace too hot, cast the jewels over the
fence surrounding the city railway excava-
tions in York-street, where workmen picked
them up and duly returned them to the
firm which had been robbed. The thief was
run down by his civilian pursuers and duly
handed over to the law.
“Yacko”: In his “Voyages,” published
at New York in 1838, Fanning records that
the crew of the American brig Union (Capt.
Pendleton) built a 35-ton schooner at Bor-
der’s Island during the summer of 1803-04.
It is possible that he may have written
Baudin’s Island, for early in 1803 the Bau-
din expedition exchanged civilities with the
Union off the Western Australian coast The
French, who had been charting (and often
re-naming) points along the south coast of
this continent were on their way to Timor,
and the Americans were seeking new
sealing grounds. Anyhow, the Kangaroo
Island of Flinders, the Decrbs of Baudm
and the Border’s Island of the Yankees are
one and the same. The sealers’ visit of 1800
is perpetuated in American River ; the site
of the forge and boat-slip is still discern-
ible. . *

“Kir”: The postage-stamps first used in
Sydney were not adhesive ones (B.
l/12/’27). The original stamp, introduced
in 1838, was embossed on a sheet of paper
to be used for writing on. It was not till 12
years later that the adhesive stamp and the
envelope superseded it. Many years after the

GENTLEMAN OK THE JURY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The jurors are just common blokes, like
grocer, shearer, cook;
Some seem so wise you’d think they’d
swallowed every learnfed book,
While here and there among the lot
Are some who luckily are not
As foolish as they look.
Tl*p jurors are a hotch-pot mixture, culled
from anywhere,
And when empanelled naturally wear a
spell-bound air,
By their surroundings somewhat dazed,
At their importance much amazed,
Surprised at being there.
They’re called and sometimes challenged,
sworn formally and then
Judge, clerk, police and advocates stare at
them in their pen,
And all take turn and turn about
To loudly, or most gravely, shout
“If ’t please you, Gentlemen!”
“Gentlemen! The facts are proved, you
clearly understand.’’. . ..
“You’re men with feelings, Gentlemen!
With guilt you will not brand....
“ Gentlemen! If you find this.
The inference you cannot miss....
But on the other hand”....
The juror’s fogged and fuddled by this
forensic stuff,
Judicial sitting-on-the-rail and ad captandum
bluff.
What’s more, however he’s endowed
With brains, he never is allowed
To say he’s had enough.
If he’s flattered into folly by the loudly-
boomed encore,
Remember lie’s a common bloke, just that
and nothing more,
And he’s never been, since life began,
Exalted as a gentleman
So frequently before.
S.A.
BILL O’L'OKTN.


“Merris”: The fierce light which beat
upon a newly-made V.C. sometimes dazzled
him. Bilson had always been regarded as a
sober, law-abiding Digger, but when awarded
his little bronze cross for mopping up a
couple of macliine-gun posts single-handed
and bringing in several prisoners, he got
uproariously blotto on vin ordinaire. When
later he went on special leave to Blighty to
receive his decoration he started in to paint
little old London a bright vermilion, and it
wasn’t very long before the A.P.M. was
called upon to act. So Bilson rested in
strong quarters until the morning of investi-
ture arrived, when, shining like a new pin,
he was delivered by an escort at Buckingham
Palace gates. After the ceremony lie re-
joined the “jacks,” who guarded him with
loving care until the, next morning, when
they put him on the train for France.

Gumblegubbin”: My neighbor owns a
shaggy-coated mongrel, half Irish and half
Scotch, which has several times involved,
him in trouble. Accordingly he decided to
get rid of the tyke, but as it was-air,unsoci-
able beast with a habit of chasing motor-cars,
nobody around would have him at a gift.
Trying to lose him up the line or across
the harbor proved equally futile, so the
owner put a rope in his pocket and set off
for Cook’s River. Half-way down the road
a motor-car bumped into him, then took him
to the hospital. I went to see him that
evening, and found his main anxiety was still
about the dog. “Do you know where I can
get some poison ?” he asked.

“H.K.” The first Australian State funeral
was that of Lieut.-Governor Collins of Van
Diemen’s Land, who died in 1810.’ It was
conducted with such thoroughness that Mac-
quarie at first declined to sanction payment
of the bill—£so7 Bs. 3d., the mourners, it
would appear, having been largely attired
at the Government’s expense. Among the
items that Macquarie frowned over were
stockings, black gowns, petticoats and black-
edged handkerchiefs for the mourners’ wives.
“D.8.0'C.”: “Mudros” (B. 17/11/’27)
tells of a disgusted pig-farmer who gave up
emptying the swill-tubs in a Diggers’ con-
valescent camp in England because all he
could find in them was tea-leaves. Still even
this sort of garbage had its value. During
the hungriest days of the war I have known
instances of used tea-leaves, dried in the
sun, fetching threepence per lb.

‘Sir Sol”: Roma, the backblocks town
in Queensland which may some day put Aus-
tralia on the oil map, owes its name to the
first wife of one-time Governor Sir George
Bowen. The lady was the daughter of
Count Roma, a Greek Senator. The Bowens
left more direct traces of their name in
Bowen, Bowenfels, Bowcndowns, Bowen-
ville, Bowenvale, Bowen (town), Bowen
Creek and Bowen Mountain.

“Night Officer”: Among the old locos. (B.
20/10/’27) still running on New South
Wales lines, and giving excellent results, are
sometime “C,” “D” and “B” class engines
the letters are replaced by numerals now-
adays. The “C” and “D” clashes were built
by the Atlas Engineering Company of Syd-
ney, Beyer, Peacock, Ltd., of Manchester,
and Dubs and Company, of Glasgow, in 1879
and 1881. The “B” classes were constructed
by the last-named firm about 1883 for the
Indian railways, but New South Wales
managed to acquire them. The “D” classes,
Avith only two driving wheels, ran the Mel-
bourne expresses to Altjury for' many years,
and were tabled, in some places, at a speed
faster than has been attained by their
gigantic successors. The “B” classes ‘ are
still regarded as the best shunting cn gines in
use, and are indispensable on the pioneer
lines.

. “Bloomsbury”: There is a world of pathos
in the ne\ys that the London cat’s-meat indus-
try is being seriously threatened by the tin-
hare craze. This new pastime threatens to
supersede horseracing, a sport which once
supplied the trade with its- (literally) raAv
materials. The path of the average racehorse
was once by way of the hansom-cab to the
Belgian or French meat market, or, failing
that, to the little wooden skewers on Avliich the
cat s-meat merchant retailed his wares. With
a slackening in racing, there will be a fur-
ther falling-off in the breeding of horses and
a consequent dearth-of supplies. If the cat’s-'
meat man is to pass, another link with the
good old days will be severed. Ilis melo-
dious call, which once brought cats flocking
from every area and roof, was one of the last
to survive of the famous old London street
cries, and its utterer was popular with every-
one, except perhaps the itinerant street-
singers. It hurt their artistic susceptibilities
to find, when they lifted their voices in song,
that they had summoned up a horde of eager
cats who had mistaken the burden of their
melody.
* * * *
“Baroque”: It is hard to say why so much
publicity has been given to the discovery by a
Tweed Heads (Q.) resident of a good pearl
in a sea-mussel, for varieties of mussel,
from both fresh and salt water, are known
to manufacture pearls and often valuable
ones. Scottish mussels once furnished a
high grade of pearls, mostly colored, but the
industry of pearl-hunting in the big Scottish
rivers seems for some reason to have become
extinct. America has long been exploiting
the waters of some of her rivers, notably the
Ohio, in search of fresli-water “clams,”
which furnish not only pearls but a good
quality of shell for button-making. Perhaps
tlie most famous mussel-pearl fishery is that
of the Trobriand Islands in the D’Entre-
casteaux Group, off the east coast of Papua.
The pearls are obtained from a sea-mussel
known locally as “lapi-lapi” and are often

Mullarula”: General elections may stir
up heated feelings, but they are not in it
with a “queen competition” in a country
town. A few years ago our hamlet was
shaken out of its usual calm by one of
these stirring events. One of the candi-
dates was a publican’s daughter, and great
w r as the wrath of lief supporters when a
leaflet appeared on the streets exhorting
the public to “Vote for Miss Blank and see
her crowned with a crown of dead marines.”
Someone must have suspected the partisans
of a farmer’s wife, for the next leaflet
advised voters to “Support Mrs. Dash and
see her crowned with a crown of Bathurst
burrs.” Meanwhile the remarks attributed
to members of the various candidates’ com-
mittees were the cause of several fights.
None of the four slander actions ever
reached court, but some of the feuds have
not yet died out.
* * * *
“Uramao”: Cabled the other day that
U.S. Commander Byrd will leave Maoriland
in September of next year and endeavor to
fly to the South Pole. The message added
that the American flag has never been con-
nected with any major Antarctic exploration.
Coming from a nation that is not addicted
to forgetting or minimising its own exploits
this is a startling statement. In 1838
Captain Wilkes, on the sloop of war
Vincennes, with five other craft, set out
from, Norfolk Harbor, Virginia, on a four-
years’ cruise. His armada rounded Cape
Horn, and called at Tahiti, Samoa and
Sydney Harbor. On December 31, 1539,
they swung out, pursued their course south,
and in February, IS4O, discovered the
Antarctic continent. Captain Wilkes called
at M.L. on his return, and after much
wandering returned to his home port in
June, 1542.

"Kir”: Speaking of casual crews (B.
24/11/’27), the train used to stop for an
unearthly time at a little siding on the Hay
(N.S.W.) line, though none of- the few pas-
sengers ever understood why. And, taking ad-
vantage of the unscheduled stop, a traveller
from one of the Sydney softgoods houses used
to pop over to the solitary store and occasion-
ally book an order. The average stop was for
a quarter of an hour, but on one trip the
bagman was horrified to find himself
stranded in the tiny township, the train
having hurried on after a three-minute
pause. Next day lie angrily questioned the
guard. “How's it this train only stopped
three minutes here yesterday?” he asked.
“It used to stay fifteen.” “Well,” drawled
the guard, “it did stay fifteen once, but the
stationrnaster and the enginedriver had a
row over their last game of draughts.”

“T. 0.1.”: The mansion Tusculum, Mac-
leay-street, Sydney, sold by auction the other
day for £28,000, was built in 1835 for
William Long, who kept the Commercial
Tavern at the northern end of George-strset.
Long had three daughters who married
respectively James Martin (later C.J.),
George Cheeke (nephew of the Judge) and
William Bede Dailey. Father-in-law later left
the Commercial Tavern and conducted a
wholesale wine and spirit store near where,
the Town Hall now stands. Alec Dong, a
brother, kept the Flower-pot Inn, Market-
street. William Long had a son who sat m
the Assembly for Cumberland and Parra-
matta and was Colonial Treasurer in 1877.

“Mei”: The sundowner —or wliat is left
of him—grows more .. exacting with the
years. Not long ago one called on me at a
Queensland station and, after receiving the
usual ration hand-out, begged for some
tobacco. I gave him half a plug. He turned
it over critically, smelt it and finally asked,
“Ain’t the boss got any fine cut?” The boss
had, but it stayed where it was. Another
frequent caller, who had a regular beat
from St. George to Roma, on to Mitchell
and back to St. George along the coach
road —would complain bitterly if offered
uncooked meat or Hour. "Ain’t you got any
bread, missus, or er bit er jam?” he woull
ask. But I encountered the limit when I
offered one of the tribe a helping of rabbit-
pie. His contemptuous refusal indicated such
a low opinion of anyone who would eat the
despised “bush mutton” that I almost apolo-
gised.

“Carisbrook, Jun.” : Broken Hill isn’t the
only mining municipality where freehold land
cannot be given away. Although the popu-
lation of Cooktown (Q.) has dwindled to
less than -300 the to>vn council recently
inserted an optimistic advertisement in the
local paper announcing that if all back rates
were not forthwith paid up offenders would
be fined. The back rates amount to some-
thing like £40,000 !

“P.M.”: The John Hop in a northern Vic.
town is red-hot on ’possum-hunters. The
other night he heard shots down the creek,
and promptly took the trail. After several
hours’ fruitless tramping he returned home
about midnight to find four freshly-skinned
’possums hanging on the police-station gate !
* * * *
“Feng-Shui”: One of the
theories of Prof. MacMillan
Brown, of Maoriland, is that
islands of the Pacific are con-
stantly rising and subsiding, and
that on some occasion in the
remote past the submergence has
been so sudden as to overwhelm
populous empires. The theory
receives confirmation from Uncle
Sam’s latest hydrographic sur-
vey, which has reported that a
volcanic island between Hong
Kong and Manila, previously
97 feet high, now gives sound-
ings of 25 fathoms. Apparently
a section of humanity went
down with the island. The
place was the headquarters of a
Chlria-Malay pirate named Dah-
lak, who for a long time has
been a nuisance in those parts.
The Philippines Government
was on the point of sending an
expedition to wipe him and his
followers out when Nature took
a hand. At any rate, he hasn’t
since been heard of. This isn’t
the only service which has been
performed by the phenomenon.
The guano on Nauru and Ocean
islands could only have reached
its present chemical condition
by the action of seawater. There
is evidence in plenty that these
invaluable manure-heaps have
been up and down more than
once, carrying population with
them at each descent.
* * *
“Ex-Dig.”: “Bildad” (B.
24/11/’27) creates for himself
the delusion that, the really use-
ful “office soldiers” who had to
do with the administrative side
of war were included in my re-
ference to “popinjays.” Probably
these men detested as much as
the fighting ranks the type which
made all the fuss over saluting
and other frills. The really
efficient office soldier was too
busy to notice such matters. The
popinjay type was not unknown
in the A.I.F. either; the nearer
you got to the line the more
camaraderie showed itself be-
tween officers and men. It was
the officers who were most com-
pletely out of the fight who
sternly maintained their haughty
dignity. One A.I.F. officer was
hurriedly sent out of the line,
after he had been there for an
hour, in dread of the effect of
his fearfulness on the morale of
the men. Later on, in charge of
a wayback sanitary depot or
something, he kept his men in a
state of polish and shine which
earned him rapid promotion
from other popinjay “heads.”
That man still clings to the use
of the rank most fighting officers
have dropped.

“Nikko”: Blenheim, a Maori-
land town ordinarily distin-
guished for its peaceful atmo-
sphere, was rudely disturbed the
other evening when the twilight
hush was rent by the agonised
shrieking of a steam siren. The
continuous blast brought out the
fire brigade in hot haste, but no
fire could be discovered. A
special squad of police turned
out; the river board inspector,
suspecting a cloudburst in the hills, tele-
phoned furiously, to know just when the flood
waters would overwhelm the town, and the
power board hurriedly collected its repair
gang in case the uproar meant a breakdown
in the main transmission-line. Then the tur-
moil lulled as suddenly as it had begun, and
5000 perspiring citizens mopped their brows
and asked for explanations. The cause of
the commotion was finally traced to a
traction-engine, that, approaching a cross-
road, had with commendable caution sig-
nalled its approach; nobody was more
astounded than the crew when the siren re-
fused to be stilled and insisted on shrieking
for 15 minutes on end. A couple of wet
sacks subdued the din sufficiently to let the
town return to its normal peacefulness.
ROMANCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I thought Romance would mean
Rome, Venice, moon agleam,
With blue canals and quays
And old-world mysteries.
I thought it would mean change,
Great countries new and strange,
And each dear dreamed-of thing
Of long desiring.
All great adventures knowit,
A garden, red rose blown,
Within whose scented heart
The world could play no part.
I thought Romance meant pride
Of each wish satisfied
A prince, an emperor,
Or poet-troubadour
Who only lived to please
And serve me on his knees.
I thought Romance meant gifts
Such as a Sultan lifts
Before a woman’s eyes
More vain than she is wise.
I had not understood
That, by a fire of wood,
It meant an easy-cliair
And your head resting there,
Soft lamplight and the glow
Of little things I know —
Your dog—the pipe you smoke—
Your books, the village folk,
Or, by your smile beguiled,
The laughter of a child.
I thought Romance would mean
Rome, Venice, moon agleam.
What matter Why or How
Since I know better now?

“M.G.S.”: Anybody who harbors the
delusion that the song of birds is the sweet
thing that poets rave about should go and
listen to them. I have just been camping
on the banks of the Murray and the Coorong,
which is supposed to be specially selected by
the avian world for madrigals. Straining
my ears in the evenings and the dewy morn-
ings for a fortnight, I failed to hear a soli-
tary chord that if introduced into a symphony
orchestra performance in the city would
not get the introducer the glassy stare from
any conductor, as well as hisses from any
audience with a reasonably cultivated ear.
One feathered throat (unidentified) produced
ONE TO THE MAID.
“And you call yourself a lady’s maid, do you?”
“No, ma’am—just a maid!”
portion of a bar which was moderately
pleasant, but immediately lapsed into a dis-
gusting discord. All the birds I heard were
deplorable at counterpoint, and fugues be-
tween males and females of the same species
were terrible to listen to. The next poet
or writer who rhapsodises about the music
of the bush should be compelled to add a
postscript giving the names of the birds per-
forming and the musical notation of their
allegedly tuneful song.

“Gasper”: The news that the English
National Society of Non-Smokers has started
an all-British campaign in London
l’ecalls the propaganda indulged in
by a quaint Brisbane identity of
over a generation ago. He was an
old and respected civil servant,
whose obsession had become a real
mania. His practice was to parade
up and down Queen-street during
the luncheon hour, a tall silk hat
on his head and his whiskers and
frock-coat flowing behind him.
Every few yards he would stop
and confronting a smoker would
announce in a terrible voice, “All
smokers are of the Devil,” or “You
will smoke more furiously in Hell,”
or some similar warning. One day he
overdid it on the Itoma-street rail-
way station, when he addressed a
few choice admonitions on his pet
subject to old Thomas Mcllwraith,
then a power in Queensland. The
result was a visit to the Mental
Hospital at Goodna, and he acquired enough
sense there to keep his opinions to himself
when he came out and picked up his job
again.

“Retired Volt”: The 4000 miles between
Wyndlxam (W.A.) and Townsville (Q.) is
not the longest telegraphic link in the world
(B. 24/11/’27). The Great Northern, be-
tween Petrograd and Peking, beats it by
nearly 2000 miles. The Commonwealth’s is,
however, probably the longest Government-
owned line in existence. The Russian one
belongs to a Danish firm. It would have
been confiscated, along with everything else,
only one end of it was out of Soviet reach.
“X.N.0.”: The Greycliffe inquiry was so
strewn with “knots” and “nautical miles”
that it is worth recalling that the former was
originally an actual knot tied in a log-line.
A ship ascertained her speed by veering over
the stern a “log-ship,” a triangular piece of
wood weighted to float vertically and
attached to a log-line. The resistance of the
vertical face to the water unreeled the
log-line, and the amount of line unreeled in
a given time was a measure of speed. The
log-line itself was divided by knots into
lengths of 47ft. Sin., and a 28-seeond hour-
glass was used for timing. This 28 seconds

bears the same ratio to one hour as
bears to a nautical mile of 6080 ft. Hence,
if six knots on the line passed astern in
28 seconds, the ship was travelling at six
nautical miles per hour. A knot is not a
nautical mile. If it is a distance at all, it
is 474 ft., but actually it is a measure of
speed, not distance.

“Skyrider”: The Bondi tram halted at
that tangled web of rails and curves which
characterises the Hunter-Elizabetli-streets
intei-section, and round the corner
lurched a sozzled reveller. Unsteadily
he scaled a pile of wood blocks left
by the relaying gang and, pulling him-
self together with a desperate effort, shot
into the open compartment as the tram
gathered speed, and subsided on to an empty
seat. The tram rattled on its way, passen-
gers boai-ded it and alighted, but he slept
on. Presently, on the rise beyond Waver ley,
a chill wind swept up from the sea and he
sat up. He looked aci'oss at me. “Werammi?”
he queried. “Not far from Bondi,” I told
him. A smile of beatific satisfaction illu-
mined his face. “Wotabittaluck,” he
mumbled ; “I was (join’ to—hie —Bonni.”

“Tiny” : That illustrated joke regarding the
cow-cocky who threatened to sue the crashed
aviator for a possible reduction in the milk
yield has a substantial foundation in fact.
Back in 1910 or thereabouts, when Manuel
de Fra and a few others of our aerial
pioneers occasionally succeeded in flying a
few feeble yards over the Botany (Sydney)
dairies, one of them was sued in the local
court for adverse interference with Straw-
berry’s duties, and the dairyman plaintiff
recovered something more than merely nom-
inal damages. Australia’s busiest private
’drome is now out that way, but the bovinos
have long ceased to miss a chew of the cud
over it.

“Glen A.”: One hundred years ago last
week Sydney awoke to find itself in posses-
sion of the first lending library in Aus-
tralia. It was known as the “Subscription
Library and Reading-room,” and its stock-in-
trade of about 1000 volumes was shelved at
Terry’s Buildings, in Pitt-street. The en-
trance fee was five guineas, and the annual
subscription two, admission being by ballot,
except in the case of naval officers. A fac-
simile of the rules, together with a list of
the original subscribers, is preserved in the
Mitchell Library.

“G.8.L.”: A paragraph appeared a few
weeks ago about John Wilson, the ex-
con vict who lived with a tribe of Hawkes-
bury River blacks in the early days
of N. S. Wales and subsequently did
some exploration work. The facts are
that in 1798 Wilson was sent by Governor
Hunter as guide with an expedition de-
spatched to search for a rumored "colony of
white people at no very great distance in tfie
back country—lso or 200 miles—where there
is abundance of every sort of provision,
This amazing legend had somehow spread
among the convicts, and Hunter, it would
seem, humored it by permitting certain
ticket-of-leave men to accompany the soldiers
who comprised what was practically the first
exploring party in the history of the colony.
When the mountains were reached the party
lost heart' and returned, with the exception
of Wilson, a man named Roe and a lad
named Barracks, who persevered a little
longer with their quest. Barracks, who could
wi’ife, had been instructed by the Governor
to keep a diary, and some account of the
expedition, taken from the lad’s notes,
appears in Collins’s history. After their re-
turn Wilson and Barracks, with two com-
panions, went out on a second journey; Bar-
racks’s journal containing an account of this
is still preserved in the Mitchell Library. A
perusal of it will convince anyone that these
four early explorers had plenty of grit. They
discovered the Picton Lakes, Mount Jellore
and Nattai River, and reached Mount Tow-
rang, near Goulburn, before retracing their
steps.
“Chevroford”: Although Mount Gambier
(S.A.) lies in a pretty flat plain at the
foot of its curious Volcano, its drainage gives
it no anxiety. At the back of the civic hall
is a pretty public garden, and in the middle
of the garden is a curious hole. Into this
hole three-quarters of the town’s drains
have been directed. During a storm-burst
the level of the water in the natural sump
rises about nine feet, but it gets back to
normal as soon as the moisture ceases. No-
body knows where the water goes, and it is
just as well not to inquire. The town gets its
drinking supply from the Blue Lake, which
lies like an amethyst imbedded in the mount
adjacent.

’E ought to know that caper won’t get ’im
anywhere.
It must set tongues a-waggin’—a thing
you can’t prevent—
The bumboat alius callin’ and empties round
the tent.
I don’t suppose it’s likely ’e’ll ever tumble

On principle I couldn’t, for when things

'E never touches me up—if ’e gets sober

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The lights are on the harbor,
The wind is from the sea;
It brings a tang of.salty spray
, That stirs the heart of me.
And I would leave the hot street,
The Promenade and Strand.
And go where grey-green breakers roll,
Along the foam-flecked sand.
A big ship on the harbor
Is waiting for the tide,
With cargo for a sunny shore,
Where pearling luggers ride.
The thunder of fixe surf sends in,
Across the harbor bar,
A deep-toned invitation
To ocean tracks afar.
And I would leave the hot street
For some place green and c 001....
But on the stairs I hear the boss
And sneak back to my stool.
VICTORIA.

JN hundreds of average Australian homes there
are now two motor-cars —“a car for her, too,
so that now there may be transportation for the
family while “he” drives to business.
And the family car has such a wide usefulness! —
shopping, running into town, taking the children
to school, afternoon calls, meeting trains, and the
many additional trips that must be made to and
from the house as part of every day’s work.
Chevrolet is admirably suited to a woman’s needs.
It is so easy to drive and to park that women
handle it with perfect safety and confidence under
every condition of road and traffic. And with
striking new bodies, it provides in abundant
measure the comfort, charm and elegance that
women enjoy in a motor car.

More fish than ever were drawn into the
co.’s net last year, and the catch —£821,768
measured in net premium income—was
£93,845 greater than the 1926 haul. Heavy
losses, a common experience amongst under-
writers in the past year, were, however, re-
sponsible for a drop in the net earnings;
still it was only a little one, and the figures
are the second best in the co.’s history. They
represent an attractive 28.1 p.c. on capital
compared with 28.9, 20.9, 20.4, 20.1, 19.5 and
21.3 p.c. back to 1921. The usual 121 P.c.
to shareholders called for less than half the
year’s net profit, and over the past seven
years only 54.9 p.c. of the total net earnings
has been distributed. Thus reserves have
grown to be £88,047 in excess of the round
half-million of paid capital, and £425,000 of
the latter came to shareholders in gift issues.
With these attractions on view, with
assets modestly valued and with something
tucked away for contingencies (the latter are
locked up with sundry creditors, reinsurances
and claims, £465,510), the market has
become eager in its anticipation of benefits,
which do not appear to be very far distant.
The last gift, eight years back, was in the
proportion of one for two. A similar bene-
diction would now call for £250,000 and
make paid capital £750,000. On that a 12*
p.c. div. would require £93,750 ; and as that
is equal to only two-tliirds of last
year’s net earnings, it looks as though such
a distribution is quite feasible, especially
as only once in the past 10 years have net
profits dropped below the £lOO,OOO mark.
The co. is blessed with an energetic man-
agement which has inherited a sound policy
whose foundations were laid 40 years back by
James Burns when he founded the co. as an
offshoot of Burns-Philp. The growth of the
business is reflected in this comparison of
underwriting results: —

The young New York and Montreal offices,
no doubt, are making their influence felt, but
the figures suggest that there might have
been an all-round expansion of business.
Losses last year ware exceptional—the
heaviest since the beginning of the century.
The underwriting profit dropped to 8.8 p.c.
compared with 11.7, 8.4, 9.3 and 10.8 p.c.
back to 1923. This was partly offset by a
climb of £8290 to £68,368 in interest and
rents, the total being £5868 in excess of the
year’s div. requirements. The remarkable
feature of the table is that, while net
premiums have nearly doubled in the last
live years, exes, have been cut back p.c.
Policy-holders are well protected; the
£350,000 put by to cover unexpired risks is
over the 40 p.c. usually accepted as safe, and
more than 90 p.c. of the funds, which are
nearly 2* times greater than last year’s
exceptional losses, are in handy form:—

The year’s surplus income was invested in
shares, debentures, deposits and Government
securities, and that promises well for another
advance in interest earnings.
The market values the scrip at 555. 6d.,
and the visible backing amounts to 435. 6d. in
net tangibles, and the immediate return is
4.5 p.c. A one-in-two bonus would make
the return 6.7 p.c. on a 124 p.c. div. basis.

There has been no pause in the society’s
development for the last 20 years and more.
Progress over the last five years has been
marked, and the figures for the 12 months to
September 30 put another notch m a long
line of records. The new business written
in both departments amounts to £11,483,563,
an increase of over a million compared with
the previous year, the Industrial branch
accounting for a little over half the im-
provement. In the last eight years both the
Ordinary and Industrial income have nearly
trebled. Vigorous policy-writing and careful
management have achieved some remarkable
results in piling up big figures, but changes
in the purchasing power of money have
helped, too. On the average £lOO would buy
as much in 1911 as £l7B will to-day, and
that is something to be remembered by the
insured when he considers the protection he
should provide for his dependants. Naturally
it means that the average policy issued is
much larger now than it used to be. In
the Ordinary department in this office the
average was £246 last year as against £230,
1926; £223, 1925; £lO6, 1913.
The next table shows what it costs to
handle the business in each department:—
Expenses Compared with Total Income.

1926 .. 15 16 9 „ 31 17 9 „
1927 .. 15 15 10 „ 32 0 0 „
To policy-holders every fall in the expense
rate should mean better bonuses. Last year’s
cut in the Ordinary department, although
small, was a creditable performance consider-
ing the speeding up in policy writing. Assum-
ing that old business costs 7 p.c. of the re-
newal premiums and charging the balance of
exes, against new business, then the £174,160
of first premiums were harvested at a cost
of £137,948 last year. That works out at a
shade over 79 p.c. compared with 78 p.c. in
the two preceding years. So over one-fifth
of last year’s new premiums goes into in-
vestments to await the time when policies
become claims. In some of the young offices
the cost is 200 p.c. and mure. Industrial
business, which figures largely in the T. and
G.’s activities, is costing £4 ss. Bd. p.c. less
than it did a dozen years ago, and, of course,
bonuses have improved. The society’s actu-
ary figured that during the year funds accu-
mulated faster than liabilities by £401,666 —
Ordinary, £271,858; Industrial, £129,808 —
and over 95 p.c. of it will provide bonuses
for policy-holders. The mortality rate is
not stated, but the general experience is
below expectancy. Claims have moved in
this way:—

Maturing endowments account for most of
the industrial increase, and too much
importance ought not to be attached to the
year’s drop in the ordinary ratio.
The society’s investments continue to pro-
duce a larger crop :

The office bases its actuarial calculations
on future net returns of 3 p.c. and 34 p.c.
Actually £5 13s. 3d. p.c. was netted last
year, and the net effective rate was approxi-
mately £5 16s. 6d. p.c.; interest and rents
brought in enough to pay 77.5 p.c. of the
year’s total exes, compared with only 56 p.c.
10 years ago.
The next table shows how the funds are
placed:—

Attention was turned to mortgages last year,
and the total climbed from £449,595 to
£1,065,043; and that is all right given very
careful selection and supervision. Freeholds
(£901,325 ; up £27,531) make a fairly modest
showing in a total of over £ll-1 millions;
they are bringing in good returns, says chair-
man Thompson. New premises in Melbourne
and Wellington (Maoriland) are expected to
be completed within the next 12 months.

The profits maintain a determined advance,
keeping nicely in step with the growth of
capital and the expansion of the business.
The public first became interested in 191 S,
but for a time little of the scrip got on to
the market. The Evening News was Syd-
ney’s chief evening paper for about 40 years,
but in 1910 some energetic people bought
the old Star, out of whose ashes rose the
Sun, and the News dropped behind in the
race. It was not until Holdings, Ltd., a co.
representing Sydney’s chief retailers, became
interested half a dozen years back that a
revival began. Paid capital, which was
£150,000 in 1921, grew to £414,987 at Oct.
31. The new money went mostly into free-
holds and plant. The latter soon began to
cramp the old premises, and when the lease
expired the co. built itself a fine new home
fronting Castlereagh and Elizabeth streets.
The change-over, which must have been
costly, was made about 18 months ago.
Visibly all that happened was that plant
replacement reserve was drawn on for
£16,553 for new machinery, and £6517 spent
on one of the subsidiary papers was written
off out of profits. Having settled down in
the new premises, the development continues.
Last year net profit sprang £10,942, reach-
ing £55,627, which was equal to 14.1 p.c.
on average capital, compared with 12.3,
14.7, 14.8, 12 and 10.7 p.c. back to 1922 —
encouraging performances, all of them, con-
sidering the steady inflow of new capital.
The div.. was lifted from 8 p.c. to 9 p.c., the
final distribution being at the rate of 10 p.c.
p.a. And then more than one-third of the year’s
net earnings was sent to reserves, making
them £30,706 in excess of goodwill (£62,000),

Reserves, by the way, include provision for
plant replacement (£46,118. up £17,341),
which was drawn on for £5870 during the
year to buy new machines in place of old
ones scrapped, and profits in the table are
shown less that amount.
Balance-sheet figures moved in the right
direction:—

years, has been deducted from 1922 and 1924 figures.
The financial position greatly improved. The
£43,046 of new capital that came in during
the year, and more, went to reduce the
debts, which contracted £66,559, finishing up
at £151,055. Thus liabilities were £32,306
in excess of the more or less liquids
(£118,749), including stock, compared with
an excess of £87,472 at Oct. 31, 1926. The
position should further improve when the
£lO,OOO of capital at call is got in. The
amount of the fixed debt, if any, could with
advantage be shown separately. Confident
in the co.’s ability to maintain a 10 p.c.
div., the market prices the scrip on a p.e.
basis at 30s. The backing amounts to 21s. 6d.
in net tangibles.

Profits are governed by conditions in the
building trade. The brick-making section is
the one most affected at the moment,
although in the other branch, tile and pot-
tery-making, a good deal of money has had
to be spent of late on labor-saving machinery
in order to meet foreign competition. Trade
was active during the greater part of the
last term, but there was a marked falling
off in the demand for bricks toward the close
of accounts, September 30, and only four
out of the five kilns were then at work, with
prospects of a further reduction to three.
However, gross trading profit and dividends
(£38,793) were a trifle better, and with the
help of a smaller bite for taxation net earn-
ings increased by no more than £1173, reach-
ing £25,303. That represents 13.1 p.c. on paid
capital (£192,528) compared with 12.5, 11.1
and 15.4 p.c. back to 1924, the year follow-
ing the TO p.c. bonus issue. Margins between
those ratios and a 121 p.c. distribution are
too narrow for the latter to be safe. Two
years ago, with three kilns at work, the co.
paid only 10 p.c.

The liquid position at September 30 was

(£89,241) were £79,877 in excess of the
debt (£9364). Over the last four years no
less than £29,822 has been visibly struck off
earnings against depreciation, and plant
and machinery, in at valuation, has been
steady at around £62,000. The market
neatly sizes up the position by paying 28s.

tor at that figure is nearly 8J p.c as long
as the 121 p.c. distribution continues, or

When the post-war squall struck the traders
of Maoriland the drapers were Lit rather
harder than most other importers, but the
D.1.C., though taken unawares like the rest,
made a quick recovery. The management
grasped the idea that the only thing to do
was to sell the old stocks at any sacrifice,
and get money to buy new goods at the lower
prices. Another slump—mild in comparison
with the affair of 1921 —struck the Dominion
in the firm’s latest trading year, but the
only sign of it in the latest accounting is a
slight falling off in profits. Even so, after
paying the customary divs.—6 p.c. on prefs.
and 10 p.c. on ords. —there was £14,078 to

tuck away into reserves, which now stand at
over £lOO,OOO, a fairly comfortable position
for a rag business with a capital of under
half a million. Stocks stood at £330,906 at
the end of 1924, and that was uncomfort-
ably high, but they have been reduced every
year since and are now down to £213,287,
showing a reduction of £17,483 last year.
The position has been improved in other
directions, as the following figures show :

Liabilities have gone up slightly—£sBB7
but as against this fixed assets have been
entered at £12,172 less than last year, a
very liberal depreciation allowance, and in-
vestments and cash show an increase of
£51,780. Should the wind of depression con-
tinue to blow the concern is in very good
shape to stand the blast; but indications are
that the corner has been turned, Maoriland’s
oversea trading figures in recent months show-
ing progressive improvement. Shareholders,
in addition to receiving a reasonably high
dividend return, which, in view of the steady
building up of reserves and the intelligence
of the management, looks assured for some
years to come, get a bonus of 24 per cent,
on purchases. The amount is not stated,
but it must be substantial. The D.I.C. is
a solid and well-managed concern, ami
neither its shareholders nor trading creditors
have any reason for apprehension.
* * 4: 4=
From the “Wild Cat’s” old and trusted
Queensland mining man :
Soma of “Catalyst’s” gloom (B. l/12/’27) re-
garding Roma is ill-substantiated, and for the sake
of timid shareholders I intrude. Most of the world’s
oil does not come from the Cretaceous, but in any
case the Roma beds are Jurassic, and there are one
or two productive oilfields of that age in U.S.A.
alone. Anyway, aye, with certain slight limitations,
is now no argument for or against.
As to absence of indications, Roma beds are covered
with 1000 ft. or more of overlying marine Cretaceous
strata, evidently effectually sealing surface indications.
Roma gas is wet, since it has been proved that
you can extract petrol from it.
Neither Dr. AVade nor the Anglo-Persian geologists
condemned the Maranoa. No boring was in progress
at the time, and they could not express a definite
opinion, as structure cannot be worked out there
without the aid of boring owing to the mantle of
Cretaceous with heavy soils and few rock exposures.
Cunningham-Craig’s opinion is from an elderly text-
book and must have been expressed 10 to 15 years
ago. It may not count now with all the additional
data from the Queensland artesian basin.
It is no disadvantage that the geologists taking
a favorable view have not been on an oilfield gazing
at crude oil flowing from a pipe. Determination of
geological structure and nature of sedimentation can
be made without a visit to a proved field.
4= 4s 4= 4=
“Roman”: The Roma bore should be
developed for its natural gas. The gas hori-
zon seems to exist at 3700 ft., and as gas has
been found now in five boreholes round
about that depth there is no reason why the
development of a natural gas industry at
this place should not be thrust forward, con-
currently with prospecting for petroleum. In
the United States the yearly consumption of
natural gas is valued at very nearly
£80,000,000. About one-eighth of the popu-
lation use it at an average price of 2s. per
1000 cubic feet, and it is twice as “strong”
as coal gas. It can be piped for a distance
of 500 miles, and as Brisbane is only 318
miles from Roma by railway there is no
reason why Brisbane should not get natural
gas for power, heat and light at a cost not
exceeding 2s. per 1000 cubic feet. The pre-
sent well at Roma, under a pressure of
5001 b. to the square inch, should yield 20
million cubic feet per day, and the Newton
absorption petrol plant now installed ought
to be easily able to extract. 5500 gallons of
petrol a day, worth about 2s. a gallon.
* 4-- 4:
Broken Hill hasn’t made any contracts
yet for coal to be hauled over the new rail-
way ; but reams of figures have been pre-
pared to show that the thing can be done at
a profit. There would be less doubt about
it if the Sydney-Broken Hill line ran on to
the mines instead of into the middle of the
town. When matters in connection with the
industrial agreement have been settled (the
present agreement runs out on Dec. 31) the
question of using the new line will get more
attention than it has had so far.

Carpathia (N.S.W.), where dry dams
stopped productive work for 12 months, is
well up in the collar again. Having kept a
skeleton staff at work opening up faces, it
can now see three or four dividends ahead.

W. R. Lomas, engineer of Return Creek,
a Melbourne tin-dredging co. operating at
Mt. Garnet (N.Q.) is now excavating the dam
for the pontoon. A good part of the dredging
plant is on the site, and the rest is at Cairns
or thereabout. Tin-winning ought to com-
mence about May. The dredge is one of
Poole and Steele’s with a capacity of 75,000
c.y. monthly. The dirt to be treated is
about 3,000,000 yards and prospecting said
it is worth ljlb.
F. A. Roburg is still boring properties at
Mt. Garnet, near the Return holdings, for
the Australian Territories Mining Co. Scout
bores have proved that one area of 70 acres
has an average depth of 27 feet and values of
14oz. This is now being close bored.
* * * #
On Kangaroo Hills (N.Q.) Sardine’s tin
output has gone off owing principally to the
fall in values in No. 3 north stopes. No. 4
north is being driven ahead in the hope of
striking the shoot; there is probably still
80 feet to go to connect. Sardine’s October
crushing realised only 5J tons concentrates
from 102 tons ore. Sardine North is still in
ill-luck, and finished scratching the long tun-
nel in barren quartzite after travelling 463
feet. It is now opening out on the tin-
bearing formation reported at 330 ft. as being
likely-looking.

The failure of the Northcote (N.Q.) anti-
mony operations resulted in a merger with
the old Minnie Moxham goldmine, which
carries stibnite in its ore. Preliminaries are
under way, and the programme says opera-
tions will start in January. The Minnie
doesn’t look much like a stayer. She could
not stand alone for very long, and the Gov-
ernment was called in several times to
administer subsidy-syrup. In the past anti-
mony in the concentrates was a nuisance;
now it is proposed to save the antimony.
Ore crushed in past years averaged about
240 z. gold; but, as with Hillgrove (N.S.W.)
gold-antimony ores, losses in treatment were
on the high side.
* # ■ * *
Gympie (Q.) still receives sympathetic
doles from the Mines Department, but for
years past they have had no results. No. 1
North N.Z. Syndicate and the Woolgar mine
are still searching for the black slates in the
hope of striking the metal therein. It is
the dying flicker of a light that burned with
golden flame a quarter of a century back.
Calls recur monthly with monotonous fre-
ouency, but the dividend-roll is blank these
days. Gympie nowadays finds there is more
money in Strawberry and Poley.
ij« ❖ * *
Mararoa (W.A.) hangs on. It is years
since the Emu mines worked by the co. were
tipped as early dividend-makers, but they
have not yet paid their way, though once
again there is talk of the bird being plucked
with profit. The “Wild Cat” has hopes, but
little faith.
* * *. *
McCahon’s, operating the old Edna May
Consolidated lode at Westonia, is exposing
satisfactory widths of ore and gold values
at the 65ft. level, but it has to be borne in
mind that it demands a pump of a million
gallons duty per day to unwater the work-
ings below that level. If McCahon’s could
easily mine the under water ore its greatest
worry would be the income-tax department.
* * 4= *
Last year Lake View and Star (W.A.)
showed a profit of £10,279, but the whole of
this amount and £177 besides was mopped
up in depreciation. Total value of yield was
£291,263, average extractable value
31s. 10.03 d. and average working costs
295. 10.53 d. Reserves are given as 670,380
tons of 30.445. ore, which is practically
unpayable under present conditions. Bank
overdraft in Australia was reduced during the
year from £24,472 to £18,104, and since the
close of the financial year has been further
reduced to £2162. The directors indicate
that little progress has been made with the
amalgamation project at Ivalgoorlie. No
scheme acceptable to the parties has yet
been formulated, but discussions are still pro-
ceeding in London.
* * * *
Westralia has just added another to its
long list of “oil finds.” The latest is on
the swampy Peel estate, south of Fremantle,
and “smells of kerosene.” Samples have
been sent to the Mines Department laboratory
for analysis, but the head there jibs at test-
ing them. This official has had some curious
experiences hitherto. In one case samples
taken from “an immense deposit of bitumen
purer than that of the famed Baku field”
were found to be merely the droppings of
marsupials; in another an analysis showed
that the stuff was a mixture of kerosene,
vaseline and soap.

Guinea Gold reports that now the testing
of the co.’s Lower Bulolo leases has been
completed, headquarters have been removed
to the Kaili lease, on the Upper Bulolo,
and a clean-up on the floor of the faces now
being worked on the Koranga lease will
shortly be made. This will be the first clean-
up on this lease since the native labor was
returned after testing the lower leases.
* * * *
New Guinea Gold and Exploration is a
small holding co. with several blocks on
Edie Creek, near the Royal leases. Accord-
ing to an earlier report (B. 18/S/’27), the
co. had several leases, including a half-
share in one of the four then reported to be
pegged out on the line of lode which it was
claimed had been discovered. This half-share
was then being worked, and, in spite of over-
burden and notwithstanding that the dirt
had to be carried to the creek for washing,
good returns were being got, while driving
was being resorted to as an easier method of
working. A circular to shareholders now
states that the co. has given an option over
five of its six pegged leases to Territories
Investments, Ltd., and its employees are
testing these areas. Should they prove valu-
able, Territories will float a co., or cos., to
develop the property, handing over half the
proceeds to such company or companies to be
formed on mutually agreed terms. Territories
also takes over the native labor which has
been recruited by the original holders, at a
price to be agreed on. The option must be
exercised within six months. The circular
states that a small claim on one of the
leases —probably the “half-share” above re-
ferred to—has been returning a good deal of
gold. The sale of this has been completed,
the price being given as <Boooz., of which
N. G. G. and E. has received 400 oz. This
and the other gold taken from the lease is
realising about £2 6s. per oz. The N. G. G.
and E. expects that when all exes, are paid
the co. will have about £l7OO in hand.

The first November tin returns from the
Malayan dredges show averages to be fairly
up to October figures. Rawang, with the
sluicing plant still inoperative, turned over
110,000 yards with the dredge and won 25
tons tin, an average of over .541 b. In Octo-
ber the average was practically the same for
Bii,ooo yards. November working costs were
5.58 d. per c.y. In the Alluvial Tin group,
Malim Nawar returned a little better than
.451 b., 20 tons coming from 105,000 yards,
as against 25 from 125,000 yards in October
(average ,481 b.). Malim Nawar South took
35 tons from 145,000 yards, as against 35
tons from 165,000 yards in October, the
respective averages being a trifle under .581 b.
and .501 b. Kundang, which took 20 tons from
74,000 yards in October (average .651 b.),
slipped on the November returns, which were
24 tons from 131,000 yards (.541b.). Kuala
Kampar was another backslider, the Novem-
ber figures being 35 tons from 180,000 yards,
an average of a trifle under .471 b. In October
the yardage was 170,000, and the return 40
tons (average .571 b.). Tanjong Tualong
improved with 30 tons of t.o. from 125,000
c.y., or an average of a little over .561 b. The
October figures were 15 tons from 70,000
or .511 b. per yard. Working costs:
Malim Nawar, 5.06 d.; M. N. South, 3.87 d.;
Kundang, 4.06 d.; Kuala Kampar, 3.11 d.;
and Tanjong Tualong, 4.25 d.
Austral Malay’s little lot also showed a
tendency to hang back in the collar. Asam,
which took 36 tons of t.o. from 75,000 yards
in October, recovered 26 tons from 60,000
yards in November, the average dropping
from 1.151 b. to .971 b. per c.y. Further, 176
hours were lost renewing parts. Kam-
pong Kamunting turned over 150,000 yards
for 50 tons in November (.751b.). In Octo-
ber 43 tons came from 110,000 yards
(,871b.). Ulu Yam improved with 26 tons
from 105,000 yards (.551b.). In October 21
tons were got from 104,000 yards (.491b.).
Though Thabawleik again furnished a very
satisfactory return —51 tons from 86,000
yards—average recovery, 1.331 b., showed a
falling-off from the October figures of 1.531 b.
from a turnover of 96,000 yards, which
yielded 61 tons of t.o.
Takuapa, the pride of Malaya Tin Cor-
poration as was, drifted slightly in the bet-
ting, so to speak, returning 40 tons from
137,000 yards, as against 40 tons from
135,000 yards the month before. October’s
average return was ,711 b. per yard; Novem-
ber’s .701 b. Larut’s four dredges did better.
The yardage turned over was 348,000 as
against 336,000, and the return 77 tons as
against 59. October’s average was .421 b. and
November’s .531 b. Jelapang, a Tanah Biji
float, and still in its infancy as a tin winner,
turned over 57,000 yards for 16 tons. In
October the turnover was 87,000 yards for
22 tons, averaging ,601 b. The November aver-
age recovery was a trifle over .671 b. Malay
Siamese interests are represented this month
by Nawng Pet, with a return of 10 tons from
21,000 yards, the previous month’s figures
being 11 tons from 22,000 yards, an average
of 1.211 b. November’s figures work out at a
trifle over 1.141 b. for the sluicing show,
which lost five days owing to flooding. Phin
Soon, the same co.’s open-cast show, is begin-
ning to get results from the reorganised
plant, though these are not yet startling.
Working practically half time, 28,000 yards
were treated for a return of 24.7 tons. The
October return was 26.3 tons from 29,000
yards, an average of 2.181 b. The November
yardage is close on 2.121 b.

“Spare Towkey”: The discovery of the
flood plain in the Kinta Valley (F.M.S.)
known as the Lower Perak area, now being
developed by English, American and Aus-
tralian cos., may have something to do with
the fall in the price of tin. It looks like
the largest reserve of payable tin-bearing
ground known to exist in the world. A rough
calculation of these alluvials, consisting of
40 to 60 feet of barren overburden with
underlying low-grade sandy deposits above
gravel wash rich in tin ore, gives
2,000,000,000 cubic yai'ds; with an average
of .661 b. of tin oxide, there is here 600,000
tons of concentrate or, say, 425,000 tons of
metallic tin —the world’s total consumption
for nearly four years.
s}c Jji
Katu, an offshoot of Burma-Malay, with
an area of 401 acres containing 20,000,000
yards of .871 b. ground, publishes its pious
aspiration that the dredge now beihg shipped
from London will be erected and digging
in July next. Evidently the co. is out to
beat records.

The latest flood mess at Rawang is now
being cleaned up, and the 14in. sluicing plant
is expected to start work again at the end
of this month. To make Rawang flood-
proof would be a big and expensive job;
the management evidently consider it cheaper
to use the mop occasionally.

Placer Development, Ltd., is the name of
a gold-dredging proposition floated in Vain
eouver (8.C.) in May, 1926. After testing
properties in other quarters, the co. has set
in to test a gold-dredging area in the republic
of Colombia, South America. The greater por-
tion of the co.’s capital is held in Australia,
and W. A. Freeman, of Sydney, one of the
Austral Malay directors, is chairman. Drill-
ing has been going on for some time on the
area, and recent advices stated that 30 bores
averaging 19ft. had shown an average
of 14d. per c.y. Last week a cable was
received that the boring of the major por-
tion of the upper half of the southern sec-
tion had been completed, with results equal
to those previously reported. A beginning
has been made with the lower half of the
same section, while the lower or northern
section of the area is being surveyed. Ne-
gotiations are in train for an extension of
the area at the upper or southern end.
The extent of the holding is not given, but
considering the shallow depth revealed by the
bores, a considerable .acreage would be
needed —which may account for the co.’s
desire to extend its holding.

PERSONAL
ITEMS
John T. Lang’s loss of the N.S.W.
Premiership was an incident in his political
life, but the loss of his son, John Keith, at
23, is a tragedy to which a young widow
and an infaflt son add poignancy. A flood
of sympathy has poured in from both sides
of the political barrier to the bereaved
parents.
The C. H. Hoskins family has spent over
£20,000 on a library and given it to Lithgow
(N.S.W.) in memory of the man who made
the money. Charles Hoskins would have
made money out of a prawn-basket and given
the public cheaper prawns, too. He had the
imagination and pluck that led him and
brother George to tackle the ironworks at
Lithgow after dear old William Saiulford had
left them hanging round the neck of the
R. M. ALGIE, Professor of Law at Auck-
land University and one of Maoriland’s
best-known Alpinists.
Commercial Bank of Sydney. Brother George
was full of ideas on the engineering side. All
the same, he refused to believe in the aero-
plane, and still held that the flying-machine
was impossible long after it had made its
fifst flights.
Captain John Piper, who gave his name
to Sydney’s most exclusive residential area,
was Naval Officer in N. S. Wales when he
built a mansion at the Point, where he
entertained in great style. That was in
1819. His family plate, which bore his
coat of arms and crest, is still held by
his grandchildren. Many of the articles
look as good as the day they left the hands
of the old craftsmen. Piper acquired con-
siderable property by grants and purchase
in Sydney and suburbs, and also in Tas-
mania. The most notable was a grant cover-
ing all the land between the Old South
Ilead-road and the water, including Vau-
eluse, Rose Bay, Double Bay and the whole
of Woollahra. Most of this property passed
out of his hands in 1827 for a few thou-
sands. To-day it is worth millions. Piper
was the first president of the Bank of
N.S.W., one of the promoters of the first
race club and agricultural society, and kept
up more style than the Governor. Indeed,
Governor Macquarie once borrowed his sar-
riage-and-four to take some visiting officers
to Parramatta. Piper afterwards retired
to Bathurst, where he died in 1851. There
are at present living 12 or more of his
grand-children and many others of later gen-
erations.
Lean and sunburned, with the gait of a
boundary-rider, Jack Durkin, of the A.W.U.,
was the idol of the shearing-sheds in the
Queensland back-
country. Durkin sat
for a term in the
Longreach Shire
Council, and might
have had a seat in
Parliament, but
politics had no
attraction for him.
Instead, with naive
confidence he set
out to “clean up”
the union. But so
many attempts have
been made to clean
union machines in
Australia that the
men on top waste
little time on new
aspirants. Durkin
is now swinging a
pick in Brisbane.
N.S.W. Parlia-
mentary librarian
QUINN.
By the death of Oscar Alpers Maoriland
loses one of its most picturesque personali-
ties. A Dane by birth, he was brought to
the Shivery Isles by his parents as a boy.
After graduating at Canterbury College he
became a master at the Christchurch Boys’
High School, where examples of his mordant
humor are still cherished as traditions. Then
he read law, and started practice in Timaru
a quarter of a century ago as junior partner
of Raymond, K.C. His geniality and wit
was equalled by his deftness in manipulating
an enormous black-rimmed monocle. Alpers
spent the last few years of a life that ended
at the sixtieth milestone on the Supreme
Court Bench, where he contented himself
mostly with an appreciative twinkle for the
jests of others—but it must have been a
strain.
The coalminers of Western N.S.W. have
lost a very good friend in Fred Gregory, a
man big in frame but with a strangely
gentle nature. Fifteen years ago he was
appointed secretary of the union and he had
carried on ever since. He was only a child
when he began toil in the mines, and was
still little more than a youth when he was
elected president of the Western miners, later
taking on the secretaryship. The end came,
after a long illness, in his 49tli year.
John Bligli Nutting, of Normanby sta-
tion, Harrisville (Q.), has passed out at 82.
Grandson of the famous Bligli, of H.M.S.
Bounty fame, he came from England at
an early age. He joined the native police
as a cadet officer, rose to inspector and re-
tired after 30 years’ service. In his younger
days he was an enthusiastic hunter and
established his own pack of hounds at Roma
(Q.). Nutting was a replica of what one
would imagine Governor Bligli was from
historical accounts- —a bull-necked, red-
faced fiery old devil, but great-hearted and
full of courage. He drove his own car at 80.
William le Queux, who died recently in
Belgium at 63, just after the publication of
his 150th novel, struck a good literary
wicket early in life, and never bowled on
any other sort thereafter. His team usually
consisted of a handsome young diplomat
(British), a fat and sinister ditto (Ger-
man, French, Russian or “Balkan”),
a beautiful female member of the Secret
Service of some Power, who was invariably
as good as she ought to be, and one or more
ladies in the same line of business who were
not. These, with a support of Ambassadors,
military and Royal personages, and other
glittering ones, made up a company into
which no plebeian was allowed to intrude,
save as a mehial of some description or other.
Beginning life as a London draper’s assis-
tant, he derived his Continental omniscience
from the fact that his father was a French-
man. Small and chubby and suburban, he
looked the antithesis of the glittering charac-
ters which he trotted so skilfully through
scores of novels.
The blushes of the new president of the N.
S. Wales A.L.P., A. J. Macpherson, were red-
der than his politics when congratulations
on the success of his stepson, V. M. Triko-
jus, started rolling into his Trades Hall
office. At 24 young Trikojus has won his
degree as Doctor of Philosophy at Oxford,
lie went there on a research scholarship
and the 1851 Exhibition scholarship after
securing his B.Sc. at the Sydney Uni. In
his first year he appropriated the coveted
Laird scholarship. As a small youngster he
‘attended the William-street Public School,
and Sydney Technical High put him on the
way to the Uni.
The last link with W. iC. Wentworth
snapped with the death of Joseph Mortimer
Horne. Brought to Australia by the states-
man’s son Darcy to look after his Sydney
property. Horne was closely associated with
the father in his last years. Horne engaged
as a clerk with’ estate-agent Raine, with
whom he subsequently founded the firm of
Raine and Horne, bringing in the big busi-
ness of the Wentworth Estate, which at one
time extended over a large area of Rose Bay
and Yaucluse. He was 87 when he died.
One of his delights was to arrange picnics
for poor children. And whenever he passed
a merry-go-round he would pause to shout a
ride for every kid in the vicinity.
When stationed in the Philippine Islands
P. M. Lynch, the recently-deceased Iledemp-
torist missioner, petitioned the Andrew Car-
negie Trust to defray the cost of repairing
a badly-battered church organ. In due course
he received a courteous intimation that the
fund provided only for installations. Lynch
replied that any financial assistance proffered
in this particular instance would not violate
the conditions governing the disbursement of
moneys under the fund, because, he explained,
“if the necessary repairs are effected to my
organ all that will remain of the original
instrument will be the site.” He received a
cheque.
The ’ admission of Leslie Consett Stephen
to practise as a solicitor marked the fifth
generation to enter the field of Costs in
N.S.W. Only one other family, the Win-
deyers, has a five-generations record. The
Allens have reached the fourth. But Charles
Newbon Bennett, admitted as a solicitor in
Sydney the other day, traces his ancestry in
the law back to 1770. Five generations of
his forebears, the Newbons, occupied the
same chambers in the Inner Temple, Lon-
don, and Bennett’s grandfather, Harry New-
bon, practised in Sydney 75 years ago.
Solicitor Billy King, achieved something
when he defeated sitting-alderman Teefey ip
the Labor pre-selection ballot for the city
ward in the Greater Brisbane Council. Young
King has done a lot of legal work for the
unions, and is mentioned as an opponent of
Mick Kirwan, the rotund ex-porter—very
rotund and very much “ex”—in the next
selection ballot. The Queensland Labor party
lacks a lawyer; and it’s a wise man that
looks well ahead.
Recently appointed to Guildford, Perth’s
largest secondary school, R. E. Freeth, Cam-
bridge classics man and Rowing Blue, was
for several years a Melanesian missioner,
then accepted an appointment at King’s,
Parramatta. Later he took on the job of
precentor at the Sydney Cathedral and head
of the preparatory school at “Shore” Gram-
mar. The W.A. position is looked upon as
the blue ribbon in that State.
A nice nest-egg, a roc’s egg of £7500, falls
to John Alfred Cooke, solicitor, of Dunedin,
by the will of James Cox Marshall, a wealthy
Maorilander who made his home in Chelsea
and Hampstead, England. He left £46,372
personal estate.
J. E. Gullberg, doctor of anthropology, is
on his way to Rabaul. Under the auspices
of various schools of tropical medicine, in-
cluding American and German and the Lon-
don school, this shy, boyish-looking American
scientist sets out for a lone-hand exploration
of New Guinea on a more or less roving
commission. Gullberg was in New Guinea
and N.Q. in 1922 doing preliminary work.
He carries 40,000 feet of film to record
people and things scientifically worthy of
note.
Harry Lawson, Vic. ex-Premier, has faded
into the background. New members are
given few opportunities of judging the cali-
bre of the man who led the Assembly con-
tinuously for six years and a month. But
his work goes on in the background: he still
is president of the Nationalist Federation.
Like the late George Turner, another law-
yer, Lawson got his first chance in politics
by being chosen to fill a vacancy. James
MeCay took office in the McLean Ministry
and had to go before his constituents. I jaw-
son opposed him for the Castlemaine seat
and w r on, thus depriving McCay of seat and
portfolio. Turner was in Parliament only
5+ years when he got the Premiership. Law-
son had to wmit nearly 18J years.
Bishop Stephen, of Newcastle (N.S.W.),
has definitely decided to call it a day at the
end of the year. Forty-five years ago lie
graduated with first-class honors in political
economy and history at Melbourne Univer-
sity, and two years later he put on the
reversed collar. Followed years in Melbourne
Archdiocese until, in 1914, the mitre of the
Apple Isle was placed on his head. In
1919 he was translated to Coalopolis. His
proposal to live near Melbourne recalls that
three other retired Anglican aprons are
already there —Langley, Green and Arm-
strong.
The present campaign of the Brotherhood
of the Good Shepherd, an Anglican activity
in N. S. Wales and Bananaland backblocks,
marks the 25th anniversary of its founda-
tion. Bishop Camidge. long since departed,
was the prelate that Dr. Long, of Bathurst
(N.S.W.), is representing to-day. A. L.
Wylde, recently-elected coadjutor of the City
of the Plains, is the seventh Bush Brother
to be elected to the Australian hierarchy.
Alderman Jack Gardiner’s re-appointment
as chairman of the town hall and baths com-
mittee of Melb. City Council recalls that he
was a member of Vic. Assembly no less
than 47 years ago, and it is 35 years since
he last sat in the Opposition corner.
C. J. King, chaplain to the Macarthur-
Onslows at Camden (N.S.W.), retires pre-
sently after 37 years’ continuous service.
The squire of the Cow Pastures may have
some difficulty in replacing him. Maybe
the Cold Country will be combed for his
successor. C. J. King is a brother of New
Guinea missionary and lexicographer Cop-
land King and one of the many descendants
of Australia’s early Governor.
Alf Foster, recently appointed Vic. County
Court Judge for six months, has been given
a permanency by the Labor Government. The
County Court business has grown to such
an extent that the extra full-time man is
needed to cope with it. Before his elevation
to the Bench Foster was one of Labor’s
strongest men ; but no protest was made by
political opponents against his appointment
such as Labor made against the selection of
Drake-Broqkman to the Fed. Arbitration
Court.
Veteran WILLIAM THOMAS APPLE-
TON, Melbourne, founder of the Aus-
tralian Steamship Owners’ Federation,
the foremost figure on the employers’
side in the present waterside hold-up.
Charles Martin, director of the Lister
Institute, London, w T as prof, of physiology at
Melb. Uni. when this century was a toddler.
There are still some old hands at the know-
ledge-foundry in Grattan-street who remem-
ber him, and wffien he got a knighthood some
months ago the Uni. Council sent him felici-
tations. The old chap wms so delighted at
being remembered that he almost forgot to
say anything in his letter about the handle
to his name.
A HERCULEAN JOB.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The N.S.W. Government is still looking about
for a chairman of the Civic Commission that is to
clean up Sydney municipal affairs. Mr. Arthur
Collins, of London, is said to have declined the
job and the name of General Monash is now men-
tioned.”
Hercules was a workman able;
At shifting rubbish he had no peers;
He started on the Augean stable
That held some thirty thousand steers
And hadn’t been cleaned for thirty years.
Yet soon he made it sweet and pretty,
Ye gods! ’twas a feat that still endears.
Who’ll do- the same for Sydney city?
’Tis hard to separate fact from fable,
Or myth from history, in clear-cut spheres.
But I’ll bet the bullocks kicked up a babel
And the men of Elis gave ringing cheers
As the river swept through the layers and
tiers
Of filth, while the minstrels chanted a ditty
And crowed Here’s praises, like chan-
ticleers ....
Who’s playing the hose on Sydney city?
There’s a hall that bears the Augean label
(O wrinkling nostrils and ribald jeers!).
From basement floor unto Gothic gable
Are the metaphorical reek and smears.
The dirt of ages still adheres
To the robbers’ cave though it’s sans banditti.
Who comes to loose the stream that clears
Through the grimiest section of Sydney city?
Envoy.
The Bumbles are vanished from chair and
table;
Hushed is the hum of the packed com-
mittee.
Hercules cleansed the Augean stable.
Who takes the contract for Sydney city?

“Coral” : Dental treatment necessitated the
visit of a group of islanders, men and women,
to Thursday Island. The village policeman
discoursed on the wonders of dental science
when he returned. “My word, that fella he
proper number one! lie put medicine along
you mouth. Take scissors belong him, and
haul that tooth out like nothing. But one
t'ing I never find out before —lie good for
make man speak English talk. Me, I look
one woman this time—she can’t talk English
along this island; she only speak language.
When she sit down along that chair, that
dentist he put t’ing inside her mouth, no

she holla out: ‘Hi, you blanky son-of-a-

“G.A.H.”: Touching the term “Never-
Never” (B. 15/9/’27). My grandfather was
among the earliest pastoralists on the Upper
Murrumbidgee, and as youngsters over 35
years ago my brothers and I often listened
with interest to his stories of the Murrum-
bidgee blacks. He assured us that “Never-
Never” was not used in that district during
his day, and that the natives described coun-
try a long way off and beyond their know-
ledge as “Nivva-Nivva.” As boys we always
spoke of distant country in this way. I am
satisfied that “Never-Never” is a corruption
of “Nivva-Nivva.”

“Te W.” : The little cod-like fish accredited
by “Mapee” (B. 10/11/’27) to Dungowan
Creek (N.S.W.) is probably the purple-
spotted gudgeon ( Mogurnda adspersus),
often mistaken for the fry of the Murray
cod —which isn’t a cod but a perch. It was
formerly known as purple-striped gudgeon,
the distinctive coloring being a deep purple-
blue, fading into lustreless white on the
underparts. The maximum length is about
five inches. This gudgeon is confined to
streams which flow from the Ma State’s
western watershed. Another of the family,
known in the vernacular as “big gob,” is
found in some salt lakes and the fresh-
water streams which flow into them. It is
easily lifted with a very small hook baited
with scraps of worm.

“Larrapinta”: Concerning those bee-eat-
ing frogs noticed by “The Rumpus” in West-
ralia (B. 3/11/’27). I’ve usually found
toads, not frogs, to be the offenders. Bees
can—and do—put their stings into toads,
but can’t hurt the slimy brutes. I’ve ex-
amined several toads I’ve found squatting
near my hives at night: not only were their
stomachs distended with bees, but their
mouths and throats were smothered with the
stings the bees had jabbed into them during
the swallowing process. Yet they were quite
lively. As for a few frogs eating all the
occupants of a hive within a week —either
they have remarkably big frogs in Westralia
or there couldn’t have been enough bees in
that hive to fill a matchbox.
“P.R.” : The platypus (B. 27/10/’27) has
a vigorous defender in Clive Lord, curator
of the Hobart museum, who insists that the
furred curiosity does very little damage in
the way of eating small fry, etc., of which
tbs Fisheries Commissioners accuse him.
Examination of a large number of specimens
has convinced Lord that the duckbill's diet

consists mainly of earthworms and small
fresh-water crustaceans, scooped up with
silt and sand. When removed from his
natural element Plat, does well on small
prawns, but only for a time. A pair were
placed in the large pond in the grounds of
Government House, Hobart, and appeared to
thrive for a year or so, but they have now
disappeared.
* * * *
“S.J.M.”: About three months ago a
shark three feet in length was taken from
an isolated waterhole in the bed of the
Flinders River, close to Nelia. The distance
from the spot marked “X” to the
river’s mouth in the Gulf of Carpen-
taria is over 300 miles as the river
runs —which is but seldom. No, it
wasn’t a Dawson River dogfish; it
was a dinkum grey shark, with the
sandpaper-like skin and characteristic
odor of its breed. Nothing but its
own venturesome efforts, incited per-
haps by fear of the water-police, could
have conveyed it to where it was
caught, and its achievement was pos-
sible only at flood time, as a great
part of the journey would have to be
made over dry sand in a normal
season. That its constitution wasn’t
impaired by the fresh water was demon-
strated by the fight it put up when hooked.
*'* * *
“Dai R.”: The kookaburra isn’t the only
leathered slayer of snakes. Riding near a
tank at the back o’ Barmedman (N.S.W.),
I was attracted by the shrill cries and
excited behavior of a couple of plovers, and
found them engaged in combat with a huge
black snake. They appeared to fight on a
definite plan, one feinting to draw the rep-
tile’s attention while the other struck with
its beak. The snake made several vicious
lunges, but never succeeded in touching
either of his opponents. I coalesced with
the birds, and we carried a bill abolishing
the snake. Then the ingrates turned on me,
and it was all I could do with whip and
hands to keep them off. I discovered their
nest near the tank with two young.
* * * *
“Kayeff”: A bush superstition which dies
hard is that concerning goanna-oil. Plenty
of bushmen will swear that the oil will
penetrate any container, either glass or tin.
I have tried both, and the oil-level remains
constant so long as the container is corked.
Perhaps evaporation, in conjunction with
greasy hands that smear the outside of the
container with oil, has given rise to the
fallacy.
* * * *
“Sea Nomad”: Torres Islanders place an
incalculable value on their totems, sacred
masks and sacred drums. They will occa-
sionally lend one, but never give or sell it.
A lady teacher on one of the islands, having
for some years endeavored vainly to buy a
sacred drum, was readily granted the loan of
it to show some visiting friends. Months after-
wards the time for the ceremony in which the
drum was used came round. The natives asked
for their drum to be returned, then demanded
it. It had, they were informed, gone to England
with the visitors. This plunged the islands
affected by the drum cult into such a fever
of unrest that the authorities traced the
instrument and had it restored. In New
Guinea I have known a man lose his life
through stealing a huge sacred mask which
previously he had offered to buy at a price
that meant wealth to every soul in the vil-
lage. These “sacred” things represent to the
islanders what our hope of a future life
means to us. The drums and sacred masks
do not really belong to the. natives; they
belong to supernatural deities who watch
over the tribes and guard them from sickness
and evil influences.
* * * *
“Fana”: The potency of “kamer,” the
magical preparation described by “Sea
Nomad” (B. 10/11/’27), can be easily ex-
plained. The powdered coral which it con-
tains would have the effect of causing abra-
sions and minute breaks in the mucous mem-
brane of throat and nose when applied to
those parts, and the organisms present in the
putrefied vegetable-matter would soon set up
an ulcerated condition. Coral itself is cap-
able of producing such a condition, following
a slight cut or bruise; should the minute
fragments of coral always present in tro-
pical sea water find their way . into a
mucous-membraneous patch they will often
cause severe inflammation, followed by an
ulceration which may persist for years.
Because of this, swimming in salt water in
the vicinity of coral reefs is risky. Most
“magic” preparations have some simple
explanation of the sort behind them.
>s * * *
“Mullarula”: I once saw a table made
from bulloak, and a beautiful piece of fur-
niture it was. The maker must have had
plenty of patience, as the tree did not grow
to a thickness of more than five or six
inches in his district. The great trouble
with bulloak is that even a well-seasoned
piece will crack when a new surface is
exposed. My friend —an amateur, by the
way—got over that difficulty by attaching
weights to his timber and sinking it under
water, leaving it there for months. For
some reason or other, waterlogged timber
will not split. This peculiarity is well known
to the sawmillers of liiverina, who use
wooden-wheeled trucks for drawing logs to
their bush mills; the wheels are always sawn
from waterlogged gum logs dragged out of
the bed of a river. Other Australian tim-
bers which have a beautiful appearance
when worked and polished, but which are
seldom used for ornamental purposes, are
yarran, mulga, brigalow, budda and several
of the dwarf species of acacia.
$ $ $
“Mapee”: Amazing is the tenacity with
which the small fresh-water turtle clings
to life. At a camp where we were kangaroo-
shooting it was our custom to pile up heaps
of dry sticks, leaves and the like to give us
light when we were pegging out our skins
at night. On one occasion we noticed a
peculiar smell from one of the blazing piles,
but thought it was merely some old bones
burning. Next morning, observing a move-
ment in the ashes, we investigated and dis-
covered a turtle which had been buried in the
loaves. Its shell had been burnt completely
through on the back, and the flesh partly
roasted, but it was still kicking.

THE DESERTED DIGGINGS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There is a place not far away
From Bogan’s dank and torpid ooze
Where all is shivering decay—
Except, perhaps, the urge for booze.
The ancient sexton’s tearful sigh
Is changed into a fretful sob:
“The blighters ain’t got sense to die
And give a bloomin’ cove a job.”
The old pub stands upon a slope;
With every gale it creaks and moans,
A requiem to blighted hope
Re-echoing its victims’ groans.
Its floor was laid with planks of sin ;
Its grog was brewed —where, none can
tell;
And most who found themselves within
Had cause to curse that old hotel.
The mines are closed for many a day ;
And brightest hopes could not inspire
A thought above the fittest way
To set the busted place on fire.
The boisterous laughter now is hushed,
The jokes of dubious repute;
The last lorn skip-load has been crushed,
The last sand trickled down the chute.
The poppet-heads are all askew,
Like sprawling giants on the spree
And nothing earthly could renew
The stampers’ dead monotony.
The mullock heaps are fungus-clad;
And frogs below extend their throats
In cadences abrupt and sad,
Unheard except by random goats.
The flat where once rough humpies stood,
That sometimes housed a digger’s bride,
Is now a howling solitude,
A desolation petrified.

“Gordelphus”: Binghi has an ingenious
method of hardboiling emu eggs. Letting a
big fire burn down, he mixes the ashes and
the hot earth underneath into a mound, in
the centre of which he places the egg. Then
hot coals are raked on top to keep the heat
in. When he thinks it is cooked Binghi
scrapes out the egg with a pointed stick and
spins it, with a quick flip of the wrist, on
a level piece of ground cleared of grass and

IkKEY: “Yeth. I wath outthide all day yethteday talking pithneth.”
twigs. If the egg spins on its end it is
cooked. As a jackeroo I watched this cere-
mony with deep interest, and, finding a
clutch of eggs a few days later, tried it
myself at crib time. But a few minutes
after I’d covered the egg there was an
explosion that upset all the quartpots,
sprayed us with an evil-smelling yellow
liquid and made my name Mud. I hadn’t
noticed that Binglii, before he puts on bis
egg, makes a small hole at either end.

“Sea Nomad”: The Torres Islanders credit
furred, feathered and finny things with con-
forming to communal and domestic laws
similar to their own. In their belief sharks,
dugong and the like have their boss fishes,
who make laws relative to hunting rights
and so forth; while animals and birds have
their council grounds, where laws are made,
disputes settled and hunting areas prescribed.
If man disturbs these meeting places he is
liable to incur a penalty. I once saw a
burning-off fire get nut of the natives’ control.
To their consternation, the flames licked up
the grass upon a little rocky knoll, and
singed rats scurried in all directions. That
mound was the rats’ Zogo-ground, and as
human beings had violated it the rats •would
plav havoc among their growing crops by
way of revenge. As it happened, the rats
did.
* * * *
“Ailuros”: It is far less remarkable for a
snake to have a partiality for fish (B.
17/11/’27) than it is for a cat to share the
same taste. A snake takes to water more
or less frequently, and has therefore a chance
of sampling fish as an article of diet, but
Puss never gets wet if she can avoid it;
the only fish she sees comes from the ice-
chest. Incidentally, I’ve fed my eat for three
years on a small tin of salmon per day.
You could use her coat as a shaving-mirror.
* '•]: * *
•“Ora”: Recently we killed a lead-colored
snake which had queer decorations. Fastened
to its sides were purplish discs about half
an inch across suspended by short hairs or
threads. Someone suggested that they ■were
eggs, but surely a snake’s eggs are white.
And does she carry them w r ith her?
* =:= * *
“Loco” : We stand at the same place in a
siding every day and have our lunch. For
company we have a number of cheeky spar-
rows ; they hop right on to the footplate
picking up crumbs. If their share does not
materialise promptly they chirp _ and hold
their heads on one side in an irresistible
manner. Sometimes we get to our siding a
little earlier than usual, but the sparrows
do not come till the regular time. If we
are late the disturbance is like a late sitting
of the N.S.W. Leg. Assembly. This is
another instance of an instinct for time and
place, that I have frequently noticed in birds
and animals.
SURE CURE.
“Don’t you ever get tired of loafingf”
“Yes, mum; but then I goes and watches some blokes working.”
“Skyrider” : I came across the old drover a
couple of tram-stops on the far side of Crow’s
Nest, North Sydney. Sitting on his old grey
horse, with two cattle-dogs at foot, he brought
a breath of the Outback into the maze of
cars and trams. I asked him what he was
looking for. “A cow,” he replied; “but how
I’m goin’ to find her here beats me.” “Where
did you come from?” I asked. He waved one
hand vaguely towards the setting sun.
“Farm,” he said briefly, and gathered up his
loose reins. “S’pose she’ll have to go,” he
remarked bitterly, and turned liis nag to-
wards Lane Cove. Even in these days of
subdivisions it seems there are still farms to
be found within coo-ee of the crowded city.

“Pick” : Our squaring gang was attending
to a special order for wharf girders 60ft.
long. The difficulty was to procure sound
timbers at the length. One beautiful stick
we dropped was over the measurements, but
there was a Bin. pipe in the butt end. Argu-
ing that in scientific theory a hollow column
is stronger than a solid, “if the blasted
passers only knew it.” Jim trimmed the sap-
wood off a straight limb and drove it up the
pipe with a maul: then he sawed off a couple
of feet and hauled that end of the girder
through a mudholc to put a bit of finish
on it. Next day the forester rode out to put
his brand on the timber. “Looks good,” he
said, referring to the plugged stick, “but you
haven’t quite finished it.” “Why. what’s up
with it?” asked Jim. “Its length is right,
and it’s squared all right,” the forester
said, “but you forgot to plug the stump that
you cut it from.”

“Vuniwai”: “Bihai” (B. 29/9/’27) men-
tions flying-foxes following exactly the course
of a river. I have never noticed this, but on
the Herbert River (N.Q.) and here in Fiji it
is a common thing to see hordes of the pests
having their evening drink. They skim the
surface of the water taking mouthfuls with
hardly a perceptible check in flight. On a
still evening the ripples they make are
plainly visible.

“E.S.”: “Talkin’ about luck,” said Bill
the Battler. “Last shearin’ I was makin’
for a shed on the Ward, where I’d got a
stand after three months’ wanderin’ about.
I was trampin’ along with empty tucker-bags
an’ pockets when I picked up "a bunch of
turnips that ’ad dropped out of a waggonette.
‘Better ’n nothin’,’ I says to meself; but I
was wrong. That afternoon I was arrested
an’ taken back to Augathella. A Chinaman’s
garden had bin robbed the night before, an’
the Chow identified the turnips as his, and
they gave me seven days, an’ I lorst the
shed. Can you beat that?”

“Wingella” ; Why does “Up Top” (B.
8/9/’27) call the Singapore-ant a new curse?
>Ve Territory folk have known it for as long
as I can remember. Twenty years ago an
old miner was badly eaten by these ants
while lying unconscious in his tent. And I
recall the plight of a young man who had to
take hurried refuge in a tidal creek (where
tlr£ sandflies gave him fits) because he had
sat down on a Singapore-ants’ nest when
out- with his girl.
* * * *
“Toonooba” : Many years ago a few rab-
bits were liberated on Hummocky Island,
Iveppel Bay (C.Q.), to provide an emergency
food supply for weather-bound fishermen.
Practically girt by sheer cliffs and without
permanent water, the island supports a thin
scrub and abundant grass-trees. Showing
remarkable adaptability, bunny survived,
though he did not flourish. After a few
years, whenever one was bagged for the pot
(no easy job on the rocky slopes), the fur
was invariably found to be black. Recently
a holiday party accounted for several, and
in every case the fur was snow-white. Are
these color changes freaks of Mendelism, or
are they caused by the limited food supply?
i * * *
“AdeL.”: A scorpion found in a stock-
man’s swag in the Burketown (N.Q.) dis-
trict recently measured a little over 9in.
from tip of palps to tip of tail. The palps
alone took and the tail Bin.; the
thorn-like spike at the business end of the
tail went fin. There is little to fear from the
stings of the smaller species found in cold
climates, painful though they may be, but the
larger scorpions which inhabit the tropics are
dangerous. The best remedy, one used by
West Indies natives, is to make a small inci-
sion over the puncture and apply the juice
of a lime. A little ammonia dabbed on the
wound will also relieve the sufferer.

It’s lonely here while Jack’s away
Out on the roads with sheep,

An’ there’s so much to do ;

A paddock cleared to plough ;
And daddy always close at hand—

The maggies are snuggled, in slumber

POTATOES v. WHEAT.
“P.M.”: “Villers-Brett.” (B. 10/11/’27)
says it is more profitable to grow potatoes
on land that will grow 40 bushels of wheat
to the acre. I disagree. Wheat has an
expoi-t market, but 1 have seen the time,
only a few years ago, when I could have
got thousands of bags of potatoes in one
district for the asking, simply because the
price in Melbourne was not enough to cover
cartage, rail freight and commission, let
alone bags ! There are more potatoes grown
now than the population can eat. There is
a big field yet to be opened up in the rais-
ing of export bacon-pigs on potatoes, etc.;
but there, again, you want lib. of grain to
41b. of potatoes to make a good pig ration,
so there is no fortune in growing potatoes
alone.
EXPERIMENTAL FARMS.
“Jack Point” : If “Azac,” who credits me
with a “wealth of ignorance” (B. lt)/ll/'27),
can spare the time, he might look up my
original article on experimental farms and
discover that my advocacy was in support
of “Chemico,” who had pointed out the
fallacy of chemical analyses as a means of
detennining the potential fertility of soils,
and l’ecommended actual tests carried out
on experimental farms as being deserving
of more attention. “Azac” and others who
have pointed out that some experimental
farms already exist in N.S.W. might also
note that N.S.W. is not Austi-alia, despite
a popular impression to that effect held by
residents of the Ma State. This country
has room for a lot more experimental farms,
a fact recognised by the Queensland Gov-
ernment, which is at present putting
through a bill providing for the establish-
ment of more, particularly in the North,
where it is considered that many thousand
acres can be put under bananas.
RETURN THE HUMUS TO THE SOIL.
“J.G.” : A tremendous amount of excellent
soil-fertilising material is destroyed every
year. And this is specially the case in gar-
dens where tons of leaves, lawn clippings, etc.,
instead of being dug into the soil or placed
in compost heaps are burnt. This means the
loss of a lot of humus, the very thing that
nearly all soils lack more or less. Very few
soils contain sufficient humus to stand heavy
cropping, so all humus-forming material
should be utilised and not destroyed. A
few soils, such as reclaimed swamps of a
peaty character, do contain enough humus.
But the vast majority of soils do not. So all
vegetable matter that is free of disease should
be saved ; in fact, all organic material that
will decay should be returned to the soil,
and not used for autumn and spring bonfii’es.
PIGS TO DESTROY BRACKEN.
“Bill R.” : This was how a N.S.W. South
Coast cocky cleaned off his bracken fields for
nothing and, incidentally, made a bit out of
it. He surrounded the bracken patches with
post-and-rail pigproof fencing and turned in
a mob of pigs to do the rest. In the course
of a short time the ferns were eradicated to
their furthermost i-oots, and the soil was so
pulverised that big crops of maize were har-
vested without any ploughing. The pigs had
so fattened that they brought good prices.
FATTENING CATTLE.
“P.M.”: A lot of farmers and graziers
think it is impossible to fatten a bullock
at two yeai’s, simply because it has always
taken them four. But they don’t fatten the
bullock; they leave him to fatten himself,
which is a much slower job. I know a South
Gippsland cocky who grows rape, barley,
etc., and puts his steers on to green feed
when the natural pastures give out. His
cattle are going ahead in winter when his
neighbors’ cattle are going back, and he
can raise a much heavier bullock in three
years than others can raise in four.
RAILING STOCK TO ABATTOIRS.
“D.McM.”: I agree with “Chump Chop”
(B. 3/11/’27) that there’s a lot of room for
improvement in the way sheep and cattle
are railed to city abattoirs. He advocates
decentralised killing, but wouldn’t a more
intelligent— not to say humane —rail trans-
port service meet the case? Uncle Sam
manages these things very much better.
Stock freighted over long journeys to the
slaughter-pens is deti-ained at feed-centres
along the routes; rest'periods are allowed
and, in extreme heat, all stock-trains are run
beneath enormous showers. But of course
many of Sam’s railways are competitive.
The Australian system is inhuman and
murderous, and thousands of cattle and sheep
are lost annually through sheer brutality
and stupidity. Some of our stock-trains are
long, trailing nightmares of dumb agony, and
the suffering benefits no one. It involves
producer, wholesale buyer, railway, abat-
toirs, retailer and consumer in loss.
PADDYMELON AS FODDER.
“Mullarula”: The common vine known in
various parts of New South Wales as paddy-
melon, Chinee melon and plain wild melon,
the fruit of which is shaped like a goose-
berry, colored like a pie-melon, scented like
a cucumber and flavored like gall, has
caused the death of many horses through its
fibres forming a hard ball in their interiors,
but it has its uses in a dry summer. It
grows well in seasons when nothing else will
grow at all. My father once fed a number
of horses on this plant for a long spell with-
out doing them any harm. His plan was to put
the stuff through a hand ehaffeutter to pre-
vent the swallowing of long pieces of fibre.
I was rather sorry that there were no fatali-
ties, because I had to turn the handle. There
is another wild-melon vine which bears a
smaller fruit, free from the spines of the
p.addymelon and dark green in color. It
will never hurt horses, cattle, or sheep.
They will starve to death rather than eat it.
JUDGING SHOW HACKS.
“II” : How can judges award prizes to the
best hacks while judging from the ground V
The judge should get on the back of every
competitor, and every real horseman will sup-
port this contention. Men who practically
live on horseback pay little attention to
color, shape and style. The bush rider
judges by comfort, and if the most mis-
shapen animal provides an easy ride it is
judged a good hack. Some beautiful-looking
hacks are slow, tedious walkers and canter
like a cow. Others pull up from a canter
into a jarring trot. Others again have to
be reined about everywhere, and good horse-
men hate this. Many prize hacks prop on
the turn, while real hacks swing in their
stride without a jar, and rare good sorts
that never see a show ring, and wouldn’t get
a look in if they did, will, when being pulled
up out of a canter, break into a running
amble, with perfect rhythm and the essence
of comfort to the rider. If this sort can
walk at a fair pace it is the absolutely
perfect hack, and yet it may be dreadful in
appearance, and mostly is. Few, if any, of
these points are taken by show judges, and
they can’t be considered by judges standing
on the ground. Hacks must be mounted
to be judged fairly, and style, color and car-
riage should be the last things to be con-
sidered, instead of as at present and for
umpteen years first and in most cases only.
Bushmen almost weep on the show-ground
when they see the arclied-necked, prancing,
dancing, cow-cantering, emu-walking things
with ribbons round their necks.
AFRICAN v. AUSTRALIAN WOOL.
“Boer”: Australians have a right to be
angry at the public utterances of men like
Harry Dawson as quoted by “Staple” (B.
3/11/’27). Still later than Dawson comes
one G. A. Julius, chairman of the Common-
wealth Bureau of Research. The burden of
their remarks is to tell us that South Africa
is growing better wool than we are and that
in fact we are not at all behaving like a
well-brought-up child ought to do.
This year at our Sydney sales one breeder
of strong-wooled sheep passed in some of his
rams at 12 and 13 guineas. He shipped them
over to South Africa and at the stud-slieep
sales there secured 30 guineas for the self-
same sheep. This doesn’t look as though the
Cape people were such good boys as the
Yorkshire talkers thought they were.
It is the want of loyalty that hurts. When
Britain got perturbed over the rising costs
of her wool during the war Australia volun-
tarily submitted to the limitation of her
prices to help the Empire. She sold three
and a half wool clips to John Bull only, at a
fixed price, and a nice little penny Bull and
his people made out of it, too. Not so South
Africa! The Cape dominion insisted on
liberty of trading, and attracted to herself
buyers who were wont to come out here,
especially the Japanese. It is also notable
that the Japs were glad to come back to us
when our markets were opened up again,
and our ‘‘coarse” wool does not seem to be
driving them away again. As they buy
more of ouf merino wool than Yorkshire
does, we had better take notice of them.
The situation is saved by the fact that
these carping critics are not truly represen-
tative of Bradford buyers in Australia.
IN DEFENCE OF OUR MERINO.
“W.P.D.”: Regarding the statement of
Professor Barker, of Leeds Uni., that 75
per cent, of Australian merino wool is not
pure merino, and that at some time Lincoln
or other British sheep have been used in our
stud flocks, it might be worth while for
some of our leading merino stud-flock owners
to show that there is no foundation of fact
in this criticism. An inspection of the stud-
books of any of the Riverina, Warren or
S.A. merino flocks, which go back for more
than GO years, will show that in no case
have any but pedigreed merino sheep
been used. It is possible that in a few
isolated cases flock-owners may have used
Lincoln rams to add weight to their fleeces,
but such instances must be so rare as to be
negligible. In Q. a good season induces such
a generous growth of succulent native grasses
and herbage that the wool grown on the
backs of the sheep depastured thereon natu-
rally becomes broader in character, while in a
dry time like the present the majority of
clips will run 64’s or finer. In the far south-
west, from Thargomindali to Birdsville and
the South Australian border, there used, to
be saltbush country similar to that of north-
east S.A., and the wool grown there was
always fine; but the saltbush is now all
eaten out, and, so far as I know, no seed has
been sown to replace what has been
destroyed. i
At the Brisbane sales not 10 per cent, of
the wools running over G4’s are bought for
Bradford. Yorkshire buyers will not pay a
price giving a fair return for such clips,
but at Adelaide, where most of the offerings
are of the broad type, Yorkshire buys freely.
For the Bradford trade very fine types are
not suitable, and the buyers prefer a robuster
sort. Cash returns for wools which will
comb a good GO’s super up to 64’s are much
more satisfactory to growers than for finer
sorts of wool produced by sheep that lack
the stamina of Riverina and S.A. merinoes.
Not long ago I saw in the offices of a Bris-
bane wool-broking firm a sample of wool
from a noted South African flock. It was
certainly fine, but it had neither the char-
acter (crimp), the soft handle nor the lustre
of our best Australian merino clips.
The general conclusions seem to be that
'while woolgrowers should not allow their
clips to fall below a GO’s quality, and aim
at the production of something of a rather
finer average than this, they will in their
own interests not attempt to breed sheep
carrying wool of very fine counts, and thus
sacrifice weight of fleece, soundness of con-
stitution of their flocks and an average
quality of wool which has placed the present-
day Australian merino ahead of any other
sheep in the world. Of course we don’t want
to dwell in a fools’- paradise, thinking that
all is well if it is not. C. A. Julius, director
of the .Commonwealth Council for Scientific
and Industrial Research, warns growers of
the need for finer merino wool, and breeders
will do well if they introduce a few fine-
woolled rams into their flocks as soon as
there are signs of the clip becoming too
broad in type, but this season the great bulk
of N.S.W. and Q. wools will reflect the
prevailing dry conditions in a clip which as
regards fineness will satisfy exacting critics,
both British and Continental.
HIGH-PRICED SHEEP-DOGS.
“Herodot”: What was claimed to be a
record price for a working sheep-dog was
obtained recently in Queensland when Stan-
ley Collins, of Cambooya, sold his pure-bred
dog to a Victorian grazier for £5O, the dog
being just on three years old and the winner
of many prizes. While the price may be a
record for Queensland, it is certainly not
one for other States, for at Moree (N.S.W.)
10 years ago a dog was sold for £lOO cash,
and at Dubbo (N.S.W.) since then another
has changed hands for £75; besides these
there have been other transactions in which
sums round about £5O have been paid foi
good dogs. Incidentally, the purchasers of
both the £3OO and the £75 dogs made bad
bargains, for the dogs immediately deterior-
ated in their work under masters other than
the ones to which they were accustomed.
GO SLOW WITH SALT.
“Homby”: Many stockowners are not
aware that salt, if given in large quantities
to stock after a long abstinence, acts as an
irritant poison, and almost invariably
results fatally. Mrs. E. A. Turner, of Bur-
gooney (N.S.W.), lost a large number of
cattle through lack of this knowledge some
years ago, and her costly experience has
since saved many in that and surrounding
districts. When unable to obtain rock salt,
many owners have recourse to fine, and this
is even worse, being more easily absorbed
by the ravenously salt-hungry animals. In
many cases where death does not result from
poisoning, a fierce thirst is engendered, and
many fatalities occur from excessive drink-
ing.
RABBIT DESTRUCTION.
“Saaedi”: Poisoned water advocated by
“Mullarula” as a means of rabbit destruction
(B. 6/10/’27) is all right when conditions
are favorable, but conditions rarely are
favorable. Moreover, the objection to pois-
oned water is that birds as well as bunnies
are destroyed. On average grazing country,
that is, country on which it pays to expend
a pound or more per acre on improvements,
there is only one satisfactory way of coping
with the rabbit pest. That is the method of
burning off all timber harbor and ploughing
out the burrows. When this is done in
thorough fashion, provided the grazier
watches his netting boundaries afterwards,
he will find that rabbits will trouble him
no more.
For the ploughing-out process some advo-
cate horses and some bullocks. The former
are the fastest, but the latter are less
frightened by the burrows. Deep ploughing
is essential, and a pack of dogs is needed
to catch rabbits that are forced out into the
open. One ploughing rarely suffices, and the
work must be continued until every burrow
is completely destroyed.
That this method is expensive, particularly
in heavily timbered country, is undeniable,
but it is the only way in which bunny may
be entirely eliminated on any station. Other
methods merely reduce rabbit numbers, leav-
ing a residue to breed again at a later date.
WINTER EGG PRODUCTION.
“Jack Point”: The problem of the poultry-
fanner is to get as many eggs as possible in
autumn and winter, when they are twice the
price that rules in the warmer months. The
chief reason for the falling-off in production
in winter is the shorter working-day of the
hens. Cliooks hop off the perch at sunrise
and set about the task of finding food and
still more food until sunset, when they go to
roost. As at least three-fourths of the total
food consumed by a hen goes to bodily main-
tenance and the other fourth to egg produc-
tion, it can be seen what a difference the
curtailment of the winter working-day by
three hours or so makes.
The use of electric or other artificial light
used in the laying-houses to prolong the
working hours of the hen during autumn and
winter is almost universal in America,
especially in those States where winter days
are much shorter than ours. One or two
old prejudices against the system, e.g., that
it wasn’t natural and that the birds would
break down under the sti-ain, haven’t been
borne out by experience. The birds have been
found perfectly willing to work a few extra
hours provided they are supplied with the
necessary illumination.
Egg production is generally reckoned to be
improved 25 per cent, by using lights. Four
different methods have been tried; morning
lights only, evening lights only, a feed about
three hours after going to roost, the lights
being put on for about one hour; both morn-
ing and evening lights. Different methods
are favored by different farmers, but results
do not seem to vary to any great extent. I
am not aware whether any Australian poul-
try-farmers have ever tried the method, but
certainly there are many who could employ it
to advantage. Electric light is available to
a good many from the usual municipal
supply, whilst a self-contained plant would
not he altogether out of the question for
some big farms. bor the smaller man,
benzine lamps are a good substitute. The
hens should be given 13 hours of feed-
ing time all the year round, which means
that “artificial daylight” would have to be
supplied for anything up to three hours in
midwinter, unless the night feeding method
were employed, when one hour only is given
for about six months of the year.
FENCE CONSTRUCTION.
“Bronson Elliott” : The fence-post problem
is mechanically simple. A strainer-post may
fail (otherwise than by breakage or decay)
through the heelpiece of strut moving under
pressure, through the post turning about the
top of the strut, or through the post lifting
out of the ground.
Make the heelpiece 30in. x Sin. x 3in., and
keep the heel of the strut 6in. under ground.
Sink the hole for the heelpiece so that the
wood bears hard against undisturbed soil.
The post will turn round the top of the
strut only if the strut is kept too low. It
is mechanically correct to fix the height of
the top of the strut at the average height
of the wires above ground. In an ordinary
cocky-fence, with three wires spaced 15in.
apart, the bottom wire being 15in. from the
ground, this works out at two-thirds of the
height—3oin. from the ground.
The tendency to lift the strainer-post
depends only upon the horizontal distance
between the centre of the post and the heel
of the strut. The greater this distance the
less the lift.
A strut 9ft. or 10ft. long is fairly easy
to handle, and with its top at two-thirds of
(Continued on page 31.)

Two Records f/
We know for a fact that several unsuccessful attempts
were made on the Melbourne-Sydney record established
in 1 924 by the late Mr. A. V. Turner in his Itala. This
record is considered to be the most important and most
difficult in Australia.
We are proud, therefore, to be able to state that on
Monday, 21st November, a HUDSON SUPER-SIX,
driven by Messrs. Buckley and Bartlett, succeeded AT
ITS FIRST ATTEMPT in making new figures for this
run. The car left Melbourne at 4.5 a.m. and reached
Sydney at 3.59 j p.m., covering the 576 miles in 1 1 hours
minutes, averaging 48 m.p.h. and reducing the
previous record by minutes. Incidentally, it is the
first and only car to travel between these cities in
under 12 hours.
This is the second record Mr. Buckley’s HUDSON has
established, the other being from Sydney to Cowra,
N.S.W., on 4th September—also a first and successful
attempt.
This HUDSON is standard,
except for:
Revolution indicator.
Sonnerdale 3J to 1 rear axle ratio and higher ratio to
second gear.
Electric force feed peti-ol pump.
Special petrol tank 30 gallons capacity.
“June” lubricator.
Rebound leaves in front spring, and extra main leaves
throughout.
Hartford shock absorbers.
Back axle set to reduce angularity through universals on
account of no body weight to compression springs.
In spite of the gruelling work the engine was called upon
to perform, no departure from the standard splash lubri-
cation system was necessary, because of the Hudson
Super Six compensated crankshaft, which absolutely
eliminates all friction and vibration.

the height extends quite far enough from
the post to stop any tendency to lift.
At all Corners two struts must be used.
The single strut, dividing the angle, so often
seen, would be all right if the strains in
both lines of wires remained always the
same. This is impossible. Sooner or later,
the pull on one side relaxes, the post cants
over, and the single strut becomes useless.
The work of putting in two struts at each
corner at first will pay for itself later,
when repairs become necessary on account
of trees falling across the fence or cattle
breaking through.
CARPET GRASS.
“T.H.”: Can any readers of this page
tell me where I can obtain “carpet-grass”
seed? The grass has been highly recom-
mended by some recent contributors for its
drought-resisting properties.
SORGHUM POISONING.
“Villers-Brett.”: Sorghums contain sub-
stances from which prussic acid may be
generated if favorable conditions arise.
Drought appears to favor the transforma-
tion, and then a useful fodder becomes a
powerful poison. According to some autho-
rities aphidse stimulate the production of
poison. The symptoms of poisoning are
drowsiness, running at the eyes, muscular
twitchings, numbness of limbs, staggering
gait, and involuntary passing of urine. The
safest method of feeding sorghum is to cut
and dry in the sun for some hours before
use. On no account turn hungry stock on
it before testing with a few animals, pre-
ferably the least valuable. Death from
poisoning occurs very rapidly, but if taken in
time a drench of a strong solution of
molasses unites with the free acid. Stimulants
such as coffee and whisky are useful.
A DANGEROUS PLANT.
“Spike”: Apropos of Professor Ewart’s
discovery that a plant ( Indigofera lino-
phylla) common in parts of Australia con-
tains a powerful heart stimulant (B.
6/10/’27), it is doubtful if its medicinal
virtues in this direction will counterbalance
the fact of it being a most dangerous curse
where stock is concerned.
To working bullocks its action is particu-
larly deadly, affecting the hind legs and
quarters and causing the animals’ urine to
turn almost to blood.
That “the plant when taken through the
stomach has a relatively feeble [stimulative]
action” is also questionable. Having once
tasted the stuff, a bullock, when turned On to
indigo country, will leave good feed to fill
up on the rubbish with the persistency of
a drug addict. The effect which the plant
has on bush cattle is not so severe, but it
is sufficient to account for many losses.
A WORD FOR WEEPING WILLOWS.
“Mullarula” : I believe as a general rule in
planting Australian trees wherever possible,
but the English weeping willow might be
grown with advantage in many parts of Aus-
tralia. On the banks of creeks in treeless
areas it soon supplies plenty of shade in
the place where cattle like to camp during
the heat of the day—close to water. It is
easily grown. If the soil is moist it is
only necessary to drive green stakes into
the ground and Nature will do the rest. In
the early winter, when feed is often scarce,
the tree sheds its leaves, which contain a
lot of nourishment, and they are picked up
from the ground by sheep and cattle, both of
which do well on them. Maoriland farmers,
especially on the South Island, are fully,
aware of its virtues, and have planted hun-
dreds of thousands.
FAKED DAIRY RECORDS.
“Nith”: “Azac” says (B. 10/11/’27)
that Hawkesbury College dairy cows are
crammed in order to secure high results
on test days. The college authorities know
well that such erratic feeding would quickly
ruin a cow, and as the cows there are
highly valuable they are never subjected to
such an ordeal as “Azac” describes. In a
meanly conducted dairy, where a man might
be ignorant of the injury that would cer-
tainly follow short periods of cramming with
concentrates, the course could be carried out
for perhaps several months and produce
heavy milk records ; but after a few months
the cow would feel the strain and presently
refuse to respond. The college cows go on
doing good work until advanced age.
HOW TO GET A MILK TEST.
“Dally”: Most dairymen are agreed on
the benefit to be derived from an individual
test of each cow, but there are many who
do not know exactly how to set about getting
the test. It is first necessary to get an
average sample of the milk. This is done
by milking the cow quite dry and
taking a sample w T hen the milk has been
poured from bucket to bucket several
times. It is quite useless to milk direct
into the sample bottle, for experiments have
shown that the first milk drawn tested 1.3
p.e., the middle 4.8 p.c., and the strippings
8.7 p.c. Always, fill the bottle so as to
allow as little churning as possible and
send to any agricultural college, Depart-
ment of Lands and Stock or to a butter or
cheese factory. A few drops of formalin
added to the milk will preserve it, if it
has to be sent any distance.
PEACH APHIS.
“Yabbie”: Until four seasons ago the
’Bidgee area’s large plantations of canning
peaches had been practically free from
green peach aphis. But since then the little
blighters have proved an absolute curse. Not
only do they cause damage to fruit-setting
and foliage in the spring of any given year,
but they so weaken fruit-spurs as to cause
a heavy drop of fruit in the year following.
Although aphis infestation this season is
negligible, many trees badly affected last
year have this season made a 75 p.c. drop
of fruit.
The best control, of course, is the friendly
ladybird beetle, but unfortunately this enemy
of the aphis usually doesn’t start to clean up
the pest until most of the damage is done.
Most experts recommend winter spraying
with red oil, and spring spraying with
nicotine sulphate. But many fruit-cockies
neglect to carry out the latter operation in a
proper manner, and consequently complain
that though they may spray in the morning
a fresh infestation can be seen making its
way up the trunk of the tree in the after-
noon. In most cases this is not a fresh
infestation, but merely some of the old ones
knocked off the tree by the spray.
There are two main points to observe to
obtain satisfactory control with nicotine sul-
phate. The spray should be applied under
great pressure—not less than 2501 b. per s'q.
inch should be showing on the indicator.
This is necessary to force the spray into
the curled leaves. Secondly, spray as much
as you can in the morning, and then give the
same trees a repeat dose in the afternoon.
This meets the so-called new infestation. It
is better to spray two acres twice a day, once
every 10 days, than to spray four acres every
second day. By this method the Yanco
Experimental Farm has, in four years, gradu-
ally reduced its nicotine-sulphate purchases
for peach aphis from 400 gallons to nil.
In view of the high cost of nicotine sulphate
that was well worth doing.
DON’TS ABOUT AXLES.
“Dai R.”: Before greasing your axles,
don’t neglect to thoroughly clean off the
old grease, especially at the back where
it is most apt to accumulate. Failure to
do this results eventually in the formation
of a compound of sand and grease which has
almost the cutting power of emery, and,
where a vehicle is used iconaitantly, can
easily cost you the price of new axles every
12 months. When possible, wash the axles
with hot water before regreasing, thus en-
suring the removal of old grease and its
content of granite, etc. It will pay you.
Don’t (even slightly) overload your
vehicle. Two trips cost less than straight-
ening a bent axle.
Don’t take a wheel off late and leave the
axle exposed all night to the dew.
Don’t neglect to replace worn washers, or
to have enough of them. Wheel-play wears
axles very quickly.
Don’t forget to wash the cap also before
regreasing, and examine it carefully for
dirt before screwing on.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Silentio” : A useful line for planting in
pig paddocks is the Jersualem artichoke.
It is handled the same way as the potato,
does well in any medium soil, and is a
prolific cropper. Pigs are kept busy on a
paddock of this tuber for a long while, and
put on condition. Once established they
are as hard to get rid of as nut-grass.
“Jack Point”: “H.M.” (B. 10/11/’27)
advocates the digging up of fowlruns as
a preventive of disease. Certainly to dig
is better than not to do anything, but
digging does not get rid of disease germs
as effectively as the cultivation of a crop,
which also comes in for green feed for the
chooks. Instead of having one yard only,
have two or more, and when one is occupied
plant the other with rape, which takes all
the sourness out of the soil and is an
excellent addition to the fowls’ ration.
Silver beet and kale are also good for the
purpose.
“Awani”: Anyone trying “Carisbrook,
Jun.’s” bait of pumpkin seeds for rats (B.
4/8/’27) would be wise to keep such
baits away from the haunts of fowls or
turkeys, which are very partial to these for
food.
“Liss” : If “Jim Domino” (B 27/10/’27)
gets some Trypan blue and a hypodermic
syringe and follows these instructions his
’dogs will never be troubled by ticks. The
dose for pups of from 3 to 5 lb. weight is
from 3 c.c. to 4 c.c. of a solution containing
two grains to an oz. of water, and for dogs
of from 10 to 60 lb. it ranges from 4 c.c. to
10 c.c., according to weight, of a solution
containing four grains to an oz. of water.
Disinfect the syringe and needle with a 5
per cent, solution of lysol or sapocarb by
drawing in and expelling the liquid several
times before using. Clip a patch of hair
from behind the shoulder and disinfect with
the above solution. After making the
injection gently massage the lump formed
by the liquid to distribute it. In a day or
two the ticks will shrivel up and fall off.
It is some months since I treated my dogs
and the parasites have not returned yet.
“Villers-Brett.”: To kill green timber boil
together lib. arsenic, 31b. washing-soda, and
41b. whiting in 4 gallons water for one

“H.M.”: Kerosene or petrol tins make
excellent holders for corner posts. Sink
the tins 2ft. in the ground, and, after the
posts are in position, pour concrete into the
tin around them. This method can also be
used when erecting a. shed.
“Awani”: A good way to utilise old corn-
cobs is to use them for mulching. I recently
saw a gardener who does things on a large
scale get a couple of cartloads from a
near-by farmer. He dug them into the
ground around his tomato plants, and,
although the soil is looked upon as a barren
waste, it grew the best crop of tomatoes in
the district. No manure was used, but the
gardener reckoned the corncobs and plenty
of water did the trick.

“Barangkali”: It isn’t only horses (B.
13/10/’27) that are venturesome enough to
wade into the lagoons and swamps in search
of a blow-out on the water-growing fodder.
Around MacDonald’s swamp, the mecca of
duck-shooters, near Kerang, Vie., the selec-
tors spend half their summer in rescuing
bogged cattle from the swamp. This lagoon
being a couple of miles wide, and the hungry
beasts sometimes foraging almost to the
middle of it, it is not often that the res-
cuing efforts meet with success. It must be
about the biggest cattle graveyard in Aus-
tralia.

PERCY P.
THE SMUGGLERS' RARE.
The Water Police cutter lay under the
Beetleling Cliff, ip hiding, watching for the
Smugglers. Sudenly there was a sound of
shouts and Shots from Above, and the figure
of a young man was seen to Leap from the
Lofty Cresst. Immediately a number of
faces appeered, pearing over the rocks, and
firing shots at him as he fell.
It seemed certain that the Fugitive would
land diarectly on the deck of the Cutter, and
be smashed to pieces. But he was apparently
Cool .find Couragous. Beaching out his hand
as he passed, he seized the mast, and bv
allowing himself to swing round and round,
he broke the force of his fall. Then he slid
Gracefully to the deck.
“I knew none but Dick Dauntless could
do such a deed,” said Tom Turpin, the
Bevcnue Officer, advancing to Shake Our
Hero’s hand, whilst the Water Policemen
cheered. “But what is the trouble?”
“I will tell you All,” said Dick. “I have
most unfortunately murderd my wicked
Guardian. After driving me from Home, he
tried to marry my sister by force to his Son ;
but I came back in time to interfere, and
I knocked him down. When they went to
pick him up he was Dead.”
“I am sorry to hear this, though perhaps it
may prove not to be so bad, after all.”
sed the Bevenue Officer, “for I will have to
arrest you, much against my Will.”
“I am willing to face a fair Trial,” said
Dick, bravely, “but I would not be Captured
by those Detectives who my Guardian had
employed to solve the Mystery of the Missing
Juals.' They were in his pay, I am sure, and
they wanted to fasten the Crime on to me, so
as to get me out of the way.”
“Never fear; you will not fall into their
Hands,” said Tom. “But we have failed to
Catch the Smugglers, so we may as well go
back to Sydney, where, I am afraid, you
will have to be nut in prison.”
“Not so fast!” cried Our Hero, whose
Eagle Eye had been watching the water.
“What is that?”
They made their way to the floating Object,
which proved to be a bottle, which Our
Hero Betreived from the Sea. One by one
they smelt it.
“It is French brandy,” said Tom.
“See, there is another bottle!” cried Our
Hero.
They picked up more similar Dottles, and
this straug.e trail led them close to another
cliff-face. Our Hero’s keen eye scaned the
rocks.
“Look at that dark hole,” he cried ; “that
is the Smugglers’ Lare, which has previously
eluded your search!” _ .
“The Law . will remember this service,
said Tom gratefully. But as he steered the
boat towards the rocks, two Bearded despera-
dos appeared, rushing out a torpedo-gun.
“You know Too Much, and must not live
to tell the tale,” they yelled as they fired.
It all happened in a moment. One instant
the Deadly torpedo was rushing on its Fell
Mission; the next, the Cutter went up in
a Sheet of Flame, with an Awful, Devasting
Boar.
But Our Hero did not lose his Presence
of Mind. He leaped to a grating, which,
being loose, was tossed harmlessly into the
air, with him on top. High above the rocks
it sailed.
In a similar Predicameant another man
might have been Confused. But Dick was
made of Sterner Stuff. From his height he
could see a dark hole in the ground, Cun-
ningly hidden by bushes; and, finding that
by twisting movements he could guide his
grating, which hovered in the air like a
Plane, he. guided it towards the dark hole.
The Water Police and Tom had dived
overboard in time to escape Destruction and
they made for the Cave, where there was
a landing stage. But it was likely to go
Hard with them, for four Bearded Scoundrels
waited with clubs to knock their Brains
out.
“Hands up, or I fire!” cried a Stern
voice armed with a gleaming revolver.
Needless to say it was Our Hero, who
had found the back entrance to the Cave,
and now held them at his Mercy, whilst the
police got safely ashore.
Then he approached the villuns, and,
seizing their beards, showed that they were
false by pulling them off, one after another.
“Aha!” he cried, “why this is my Guar-
dian’s son, and these are the detectives
employed by my guardian.”
“They are not detectives, but three pf the
worse scoundrels known to the Police,” said
Tom. “And this man, Bernard Badegg,
your Guardian’s son, is the ringleader, appa-
rently.”
“Curse you, Dick Dauntless, you have
undone me!” snarled Badegg.
“You will hang for this, villun,” said Tom.
“No, no!” cried the cringing wretch, sud-
denly losing all his Courage. “I am not
the ringleader. I will get off easier if I
tell you All. My father made me do every-
thing. He was a Villun of the Deepest Die.
He forged the Will which made him Guardian
of Dick and Sylvia. He stole the Juals,
intending to charge Dick and get him out of
the way. He did the Smuggling. Dick
NO TROUBLE AT ALL.
“But, then, you’re a hard drinker, aren’t
you?”
“Hard? Why, it’s the easiest thing I do!"
didn’t really kill him; he died of Hart
Failyure.”
“Whatever you say will be used in evi-
dence against you,” Tom warned him, and
he whispered to Dick: “I nearly forgot to
give that warning. This lets you out.”
Little more is to be said. Tom married
Sylvia, Dick got back his father’s estates,
the police were able to give Damming Evi-
dence, and everybody else was hanged, it
being found out that they had all com-
mitted Murders.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“"V/ES, comrade,” said Peter Lamin,
J “when that time comes the Kingdom
of God will be at hand. Men will
love one another, and treat one another well.
There will be no poverty, no warring and
strife; not any of this so very damnable
class distinction that we see now. No king,
no government, no general manager as we
have here. Men will not require to be man-
aged or governed—they will give freely of
their powers to the common good, and will
not need restraint. The b?st that is in them
that will they give. Each will act rightly to
his fellow. With what they receive they
will be content, because it will be sufficient.
No man will get more than his neighbor—
and he will not want it. All will be happy.
Little children shall not suffer, women shall
not be wronged. The State will be the State
that God has ordained for all good men.
At last will there be “peace on earth, good-
will toward men”—everything, for every-
body. Is not that an ideal worth striving
for—worth suffering for? Worth swimming
to through seas of blood?”
“It’ll be a ’ell of a mussy bus’ness, then—
">u think that, Peter?”
"Undoubtedly. For many days the sun
will rise upon a sea of blood, and when he
has set there will be great flames flaring
through the night. But, gradually, the tide
of blood will recede, the fires will die down
—and there will be peace.”
“Wi-le we’re alive?”
“Maybe yes, maybe no. But in God’s
own good time. Assuredly. Assuredly.”
“Looks like ice won’t see much o’ this
’ere bit o’ all right!”
“Bil-lee,” said the elder man, pulling at
his thin grey beard, and speaking slowly in
his too correct English—some slight peculi-
arity of accent betrayed it as a foreign
tongue—“you doubt easily. As the Christ
once said, ‘Oh ye of little faith!’ What does
it matter whether we see it or not so long as
we are confident of its coming? That happy
time! We are not of ourselves. It is the
race that counts —our children, our un-
begotten children. The unplanted seeds of
life that each of us carry in our bodies. I
do not know whether after I am dead I will
be able to see what follows—here, where
I have been. Perhaps yes, perhaps no. But
I know- the effects of what I do while I am
here will follow 7 on—sure, certain, inevitable.
Nothing can wipe out the cause—nothing
hinder the effect. We do not live in vain—-
even the very meanest of us. What we do
—of good or evil —has its result. If I suc-
ceed in killing Mr. Farrington to-night—if
we succeed—the outcome of our blow for
the freedom of mankind will make itself
felt a hundred years hence. No matter that
it seems to be an accident. No matter at
all. The good deed will have been done. The
good that results from it cannot be mini-
mised. That is the certain thing—the only
thing that matters.”
They walked on down the dusty road in
silence. On their right hand was a railway
embankment. A train of coal-trucks passed
slowly by on its way to the steelworks, the
open door of the engine’s furnace glowing
warmly through the cold and windy even-
ing. Close beside them, on the left, was a
tramline bordering a ditch, and beyond that
a rail fence, separating from the road a
wide flat that wrns only vaguely realisable
in the starlight, stretched in the direction
they were walking. Other men wmnt before
and beside and behind them, all drifting to
the same destination. Now and then a lum-
bering motor-’bus lurched past along the
road. And soon came a steam-tram of three
long cars, packed to standing capacity with
strong-looking men, in rough old clothing.
Out of the darkness ahead strange vol-
canic flares sprang toward the heavens, and
tall arc-lights made partly visible great
gabled buildings stretching away into the
night. A huge and ceaseless noise bellowed
and rumbled always, and was shot through
by minor sounds —the whistling of loco-
motives, and the clang of metal tumbled on
metal. One persistent chorus dominated
everything—the wffioosh-whoosh-whoosh—
whoosh of the exhaust of the great engine
that turned the mighty rollers of the bloom-
ing mill.
Sometimes, down the broad reaches of the
river, a steamer’s siren halloed her move-
ment toward the sea, or up to the cranes on
the coaling wharf. Close at hand, frag-
ments of conversation, whistling of little
tunes, the red glow of cigarette ends, the
whiff of tobacco indicated the stream of
humanity that was pouring down the road,
becoming denser as the time wore on.
They passed under a trestle railway-bridge
and Peter Lamin stopped at a little fruit-
stall and bought four pears, two of which
he gave to the young man whom he
addressed as Bil-lee.
Across a cindery open space they went
towards lettered turnstiles that gave en-
trance to the guarded interior of the com-
pany’s huge establishment at Port Boronia.
As they passed in, a great musical horn
sounded high in the air from somewhere
ahead proclaiming the ending of the day-
and the beginning of the night-shift. The
drivers of the waiting motor-’buses began to
shout their destinations. Odd men, very
tired, began to emerge from the turnstiles
and to clamber, strangely silent, into the
’buses. Some walked under the railway-
bridge toward the waiting tram.
The night’s work was beginning—or,
rather, work that never ceased or slackened
was being carried on from one day to an-
other across the night.
* * * *
“Well,” said the young man called Bil-lee
to himself, as he stood by his levers in the
great engine that fed the Open Hearth —the
fragile brain of a wonderful machine that
answered instantly to every impulse he
imparted to its mighty members along its
electric nerves—“well, ’ere they come. Gated,
’elp ’em!”
He grinned in a ghastly fashion as he
lifted aching eyes for a moment from the
dazzling chinks about the row of furnace
doors to the high, dark, nebulousness of the
girder-crossed roof overhead.
Nowhere but in volcanic craters is to be
seen such wonder of flaming fire as is en-
cased in the brickwork shell of the Open-
Plearth furnace. At Port Boronia it lies
almost in the middle of the works —the fount
and spring whence flows the life blood of
this mighty organism.
Prom here comes the steel that goes to
UNDER NO OBLIGATIONS THIS TIME.
Mother: “Now, Johnny dear, say grace.”
JOHNNY (in restaurant for first time ): “But, mummy dear, we’re paying f’r this, ain’t
we?”
the making of rails, fencing-wire, rods for
concrete buildings, girders, fish-plates for
railways, “blooms” and “billets” for fashion-
ing locomotive wheels —all things that are
made of steel.
The furnace is a flat, brick-lined pan, 3oft.
long, and a little more than a third as wide,
roofed and walled in with brickwork, through
chinks in which the undying fires it con-
tains gleam dazzlingly all the days and
nights of the year. Its hungry mouths,
closed by iron doors that may be raised and
lowered by a set of levers opposite to them,
are fed perpetually with “pig,” with
scrapped steel, rail-ends and “bloom”-ends
that have been sheared off in the mills, and
with limestone to make a flux. When its
great belly is replete, aids to digestion are
administered by 1 means of blasts of hot' air and
gas that enter through ports at one end and
escape through similar outlets at the other.
From time to time the gas is reversed, and
comes roaring and flaming in through the
opposite end of the furnace. When it has
assimilated its solid food, it is given a
drink of molten iron brewed in the blast
furnaces, that comes to it in great teacups
of 15-ton capacity, carried upon rails, and
shoved along between the vast sheds by a
little puffing locomotive.
The big machine that Bil-lee worked is
carried upon a huge wheeled bogie, running
upon rails that are several yards apart.
From the side nearest to the furnace doors
a massive steel rod about 15in. in diameter,
projects towards a narrow-gauge railway-
track, upon which run little trucks propelled
from the rear by an electric motor. Across
each truck rest a pair of trough-like steel
boxes filled with whatever is to be fed into
the furnace and having sockets in the outer
end into which the great handle may insert
its extremity, cunningly designed to fasten
there with an immovable hold upon the
heavy receptacles.
Slowly the .little train trundles along its
narrow way until the leading spoonful is
opposite a furnace door. The operative at
the levers moves his arms, and, as the door
slides slowly upward, the big rod pushes
outward from the machine, picks up a box,
and pokes it in a strangely human way,
through the opening—into the roaring and
flaming inferno within the furnace. A
moment’s pause and it turns slowly over as
the puny fellow behind operates some other
control, emptying the charge into the white-
hot bottom of the pan. Then it emerges
again, deposits the trough in its place on
the truck and picks up the next one as the
little train is pushed forward from behind.
So does it deal with ail the troughs and
others that follow on, until the insatiable
maw is temporarily satisfied.
Here it was that old Peter Lamin,
dreamer of Slavonic dreams of liberty, jus-
tice and world-regeneration had staged the
dramatic and horrible tragedy which was to
finish the career of the chairman of directors
of the company—John Parrington.
Here, in the vast arcade of flaming lights
and blackest shadows and red-lit mists of
dust and steam, this gentle, sweet-tempered
dreamer of dreams of happiness for his
fellow man, who would not willingly injure
an ant, would make his protest against his
fellows’ unhappiness by the spectacular
extermination of one of the biggest of the
capitalistic parasites who preyed upon the
world and perverted its natural goodness
and bounty for their own base purposes—
symbolised in Peter’s mind by the smoking
of bulky cigars, the wearing of heavy gold
watch-chains across white waistcoats and
the seduction of the daughters of the poor!
This was to be his action, of which the
result might be evident, as he had told Bil-
lee, a century hence. John Farrington was
to be sacrificed to the God of Ultimate
Human Happiness. Peter was not quite
sure how his results would shape them-
selves, but he had abiding faith in them.
For what might happen to Peter Lamin,
afterwards, he had no care at all. It was
to be hoped that they would hang him and
thereby point the moral he had written in
blood from the mangled carcase of John
Farrington.
They would come to see the Open Hearth,
the chairman and his guests. Mr. Nederling,
the Swedish engineer who had a desk in the
big general room at the office, and controlled
the stock yard, which is the sales counter
of the works, had told him yesterday that
the Great Man was at the big hotel in the
town, and was coming out to-night to show
his daughter and her fiance the magnificent
fireworks of the Open Hearth —most spec-
tacular of all the sights of Port Boronia —
as they looked at night.
Here Peter had been quick to see his
opportunity. It was inevitable that the
woman would want to go as close as she
might to the furnace doors. They *all did —
to see how hot it was, having no faith in
Fahrenheit and Centigrade. They would all
walk across the charging-machine’s path with
her—-the whole group. He would relieve
Bil-lee at the levers when he saw them
coming. That would provoke no comment,
since he often did so. Then, when they
stood between the rails, shielding seared eye-
balls from the intense glare of the open
furnace door, he would cause the great
machine suddenly to spring upon them.
None, of course, would escape. Well, a
little sooner, or a little later we all had to
die. The lady? Pouf!
He would stumble against a lever, care-
lessly, and that would be the end.
This Bil-lee? A Cockney Bolshevist with
cunning and initiative. The most dangerous
sort of all. A murderous ex-artilleryman,
who had slain his fellow-workers by the score
and hundreds in France and Flanders, and
thought nothing of it. ' Him he had well
schooled. He was an ideal instrument for
the use of the intellectual revolutionist, as
typified in himself. Bil-1e,3 would do his
part. A covert signal of the hand, and he
would descend from the machine. Peter
Lamin, of Little Russia and Carbonville,
would mount to the controls —the Deus ex
maehina.
THEN!
Ex-Bombardier William Quayle stared at
the little group emerging from the gloom
of the long building, and coming into the
glare of the great fires. A train of boxes had
been emptied, and his mighty instrument
stood at rest, with its powerful arm idle.
Down below, a dozen yards away, old Peter
stood with liis back to him. When the old
man should waggle his hand behind him, lie,
Billy Quayle, was to whistle shrilly through
his fingers—the usual signal when he desired
to be relieved.
With his right hand Peter was doffing his
greasy cap from his bald head that glistened
with perspiration, whilst he bowed in his
polite fashion to the works manager, Mr.
Turningham. Very polite always was old
Peter. Billy wondered vaguely where he had
learned politeness. Maybe when they had
him in gaol in Russia His left hand,
clenched tightly,
was behind his
back —but it did
not waggle yet.
For a little while
the group stood
looking a t the
amazing model of
the conventional
Hell that con-
fronted them. The
fair-haired girl was
bending down ro
listen to little Mr.
Turningham. The
big man beside him
must be the chair-
man of directors.
The other —a slim,
youthful, square-
shouldered fellow
—was the tart’s
fancy-bloke, no
doubt. Mr. Quayle
grinned as he
thought o f their
honeymoon in Heaven.
Peter’s left hand was still motionless. He
was answering some question put by the
manager, seemingly. His right forefinger
pointed at the Open Hearth. He was looking
at the girl. Suddenly she lifted her eyes
and stared at Billy.
And here the story ends, so far as Peter
Lamin is concerned.
“Sink me bleedin’ whatsit !’•’ gasped Bil-
lce. “The ——- Hangel o’ Roo-ong! Her
that nursed me—kissed me on th’ forrid, an’
brung me back to life! Well, I’ll be ——!
My Gawd, that perishin’ old Peter! ’Ere’s
’is hissue, anyway!”
The group was clear of the rails, a little
to one side. Old Peter stood between them.
Now his left hand waggled furiously. He
wanted to come up.
But no shrill whistle came from the white
and convulsed face of the man at the levers.
The great machine moved forward —just as
the bloom mill was at its loudest. Softly
as a cat approaching its prey, it bore down
on Peter Lamin. It’s edge touched him
gently, below the shoulders.
There are six live wires exposed along
the eqd of the carriage of the charger of
the Open Hearth....
* * * *
Bil-lee is in Goulburn Gaol. Peter —well,
the more material part of him is at the
Necropolis, out along the Western-road. His
tombstone says he was a faithful servant of
the company.

tank. Take equal parts cement and sand,
mix with milk, and put two coats on inside
of tank. If holes are large dab on a bit of
mixture, let it set and then apply the

—“Sylvester.”
2194. —Brine for corning mutton which
may be used more than once. Place 6 pints

tablespoonfuls salt)) tre and 1 pint sugar.
Boil and skim. When cold immerse meat.
Will keep six weeks. If boiled before each
salting brine may be used three times. —
M.L.L.
2090. —Mutton or any kind of fish or fowl
can he kept for a fortnight or longer in a
mixture of I pint of vinegar and 2oz. sugar.
Warm the vinegar sufficiently to dissolve the
sugar. The solution must be put into glass,
earthenware or wooden container only.—
“Quince.”
2156. —Potted mutton. Remove skin and
sinew, chop fine with little cold ham, season
with pepper, salt and nutmeg. Heat in
enamel pan, adding little gravy, water and

—2523.
Information Sought.
Grape vines, three years old, in good
soil in Queensland, show no sign of bearing.
What is the probable cause? Cuttings were
from Isabella, lona and Muscatel.- —2230.
Vine cuttings taken from the bases of one
year old canes of Isabella and lona usually
produce fruit the second or third season.
Muscatels are variable according to loca-
tion. Vai'ious effects will operate against
non-fruiting, including excessive fertility,
very close pruning or utilising unsuitable
wood for cuttings. Diseases —notably
Downy Mildew, which is more or less pre-
valent throughout Queensland —may be
responsible for weakening the plant to the
extent of its non-flowering or the action
of mites may destroy the flowers when
formed. In the absence of actual observa-
tion or more detailed information, the rea-
sons can only be guessed.
A milking cow shows the following symp-
toms : If trotted for a few hundred yards—
even on a cold day—tongues and froths
badly. No apparent swelling of neck or
throat. Outwardly is a perfectly normal
beast and the milk seems no different to the
milk of other cows. Both her calves (male)
.'■'■"in to suffer with the same complaint. —
2413.
The beast should be tested at once for
tuberculosis.
/ want to go to England. Could I get a
job on a steamer for the round trip? I have
had sea experience and hold a second mate’s
certificate ? —2213.
Scores of certified officers and more than
a thousand seamen are unemployed in prin-
cipal Australian ports at the present time.
You might try the shipping offices direct.
What arc the prospects for a youth join-
ing the Australian merchant service as a
cadet? What remuneration docs he receive
and what premium is asked for training? —
2072.
A candidate for a second-mate’s certificate
(lowest grade sea-going certificate) must
have four years’ sea service. This must
be served as seaman or apprentice. Numbers
serve this time while employed as boy,
ordinary seaman and able seaman, the wages
varying from £4 to £l6 a month. Others
become apprenticed or are taken on as
cadets. A cadet receives very low wages.
Some employers ask for a premium—usually
about £lOO. Look for a position as boy,
if are under 17, and as ordinary seaman
if you are over 17.
A young orange-tree flourished on planting
in 1926, but the leaves soon dropped off, and
the same thing happened this year. What is
■wrong ? —2291.
In all probability the tree is still suffering
from transplanting. It may be planted too
deep or soil may be unsuitable. Most likely
some of the roots are suffering with a root
rot. Such a tree will linger for several
years. Uprooting is recommended. If
another citrus-tree is put in plant with the
bud union well above the ground—say 6in.
on a small mound of earth.
Is the N egundo-tree, used in Albury
(N.8.W.) as a street-avenue tree, a native,
and what is the botanical name? —2300.
Acer negunda, commonly known as the
box elder. Native of North America and
is one of the sugar maples.
When is a coin bad? And what is the
general practice in the matter of defaced and
old coins? —2049.
An Australian or British coin having
been defaced by having any name, word, de-
vice or number stamped thereon is a wil-
fully damaged coin and is not worth face
value; if a silver coin it is purchased by the
Commonwealth Bank as agent for the
Federal Treasury at 2s. per oz. —a fraction
over a quarter face value. Any silver coin,
so worn that it cannot be deciphered,
whether it is a British or foreign coin, will
not be redeemed by the Mint or the Com-
monwealth Bank, but where the coin can be
distinguished as a British or Australian coin,
full face value will be paid. Gold coin will
be purchased at bullion value—a hole of
fair size reduces it about 2s. CoppeT coin;
Pennies will be purchased at face value in
any condition. Mutilated half-pence will not
be redeemed.
What would it cost to lay down asphalt
tennis court? —2247.
Neuchatel mastic asphalte which requires
a foundation of about 3in. of cement con-
crete costs complete about 255. per square
yard. If tar-paving is required, call for
tenders. Prices vary greatly.
How to make grape-juice? —2294.
Take fresh, well-ripened, dark juicy
grapes; pick from stems, rejecting imperfect
fruit. Wash well, and cook in saucepan with
pint of water to every three quarts of grapes.
Cook slowly for half an hour, or until grapes
burst; then drain off juice through jelly-bag,
filtering skins and seeds in a separate bag.
Heat again, add a little white sugar if sweet-
ness desired, and put in jars or sterilised
bottles. Cork at once with sound corks,
cut level with top and seal with wax. Bottle
the juice from the skins separately. Keep in
cool place and do not disturb unnecessarily.
Should keep for years.
Has a speed of 80 m.p.h. been attained by
ear in Australia on any public road?— 22Bl.
Yes. Boyd Edkins registered 86 m.p.h.
in March last on the Breadalbane Plains in
an R.A.C. contest, driving against a heavy
head wind. The car used was a 30/98
Vauxhall.
Under what conditions in cricket can a
batsman be given out l.b.w. to a bowler bowl-
ing around the wicket? —2063.
N.S.W. Cricket Association states the
rule: “It matters not whether a bowler is
bowling over the wicket or around the
wicket. If the ball is pitched in line with
the wicket, and, in the opinion of the umpire,
would have hit the wicket but is stopped
by the striker with part of his person, the
man is out l.b.w. The point may be thus
stated: (1) Did the ball pitch in a
straight line between wicket and wicket?
(2) Was it part of the batsman’s person
other than the hand which intercepted the
ball? (3) Would the ball have hit the
wicket? If these questions are answered in
the affirmative the batsman would be out.
It is immaterial whether the ball breaks
or not. It sometimes is only possible for a
bowler bowling around the wicket to obtain
an l.b.w. with a breaking ball.”
How to make whole7neal bread? —2384.
Two cups meal, one cup white flour; mix
well, add level teaspoonful salt and two
tablespoonfuls baking powder. Mix to a light
dough with either a beaten egg and water,
milk and water or plain water —about half-
pint to loaf. Knead lightly and flatten into
shape, prick a few times with fork and bake
in moderate oven about three-quarters of an
hour. When nearly done, take out and butter
well, returning to oven for few minutes. Use
shallow tin. If bread crumbles about a
dessertspoonful mashed potato (sweet potato
for preference) may be mixed with flour.
My tortoise has not eaten for months, and
stays in a heap of grass. What is the
trouble?- —2344.
Tortoises hibernate. It should liven with
the summer. Feed on vegetables.

What is the value of Australian kangaroo
stamps, Queen Victoria issue, and Canberra
issue? —2156.
Kangaroo stamps are still current and of
little value. They would be useless to a
dealer unless in large quantities. Usual
rate paid is Is. per 100 for values 2d. to Is.
and ss. per 100 for the 2s. Lower values
worth Is. 6d. per 1000. “Queen Victoria
issue” too vague; send particulars. Can-
berra issue unused, worth only face value.
Used specimens about 2s. per 100.
How is furniture waxed? —2225.
Put 2oz. white and yellow wax over a
moderate fire in a perfectly-clean receptacle.
When melted, add 4oz. best spirits of
turpentine. Stir the whole until cool. The
wax must be rubbed over in the usual
manner, and it is essential that the coating
be as thin as possible.
How can I rid a house of flies? —2354.
Screen all windows and doors, destroy flies
with fly-traps, swatter or spray. Cover
food, and remember that cleanliness mini-
mises danger. Write Department of Health,
Sydney, for pamphlet.
Is Sydney Central the largest railway-
station in the world? —2177.

has two levels. Roughly, it is twice the
size of Sydney Central.

SPORTINO
NOTIONS
THE BURDEN OF THE BOWLER.
[Foil Tiib Bulletin.]
“Victoria, winning the toss at Adelaide against
South Australia, declared their innings closed when
646 runs had been scored for 8 wickets.”
These are the days when the bowlers stand
And give their pants an angry hitch
And fiddle the ball in a fevered hand
While they grind their teeth and their set
lips twitch;
And wanly they curse the shirt-front
pitch
Where never a fast one shoots or jumps,
And sadly feature their harvest rich
Were there only a couple of extra stumps.
These are the days when the spun coin’s
scanned
As it falls with a tense absorption which
In bygone years it couldn’t command;
When a skipper’s hopes go down in the
ditch
Or up to the skies as quickly switch;
The days when winning the toss is trumps,
And the ’keeper groans that he hasn’t a
niche
Behind a couple of extra stumps.
These are the days when the opening band
Bring bacon home by the goodly flitch ;
When bold on the board the centuries stand
And the thumbs of the pasted bowlers itch
To work on a ball with a brand-new stitch
Instead of the one the batsmen clumps;
When never a googlie can wickets witch
For lack of a couple of extra stumps.
Envoy.
These are the days when the runs enrich
The side that starts; when the bowler
humps
His load on a billiard-table pitch
And prays for a couple of extra stumps.
n.s.w. Midford.
Under the Whip
Two erratic English-bred horses were on
their best behavior at Warwick Farm
(N.S.W.) on Saturday. Mullabawn, one of
the favorites for the last Epsom, downed
Quan Tart (10 to 9) in the Moorebank Han-
dicap, for which he was mildly supported at
6 to 1. Quan Tart was rather badly placed
in the early part of the race, and he may
turn the tables in the Villiers Stakes, for
which he has Bst. 61b. and Mullabawn Bst.
—there was 111 b. between them on Saturday.
Then Honan (4 to 1) won the December
Handicap in such a style that he became one
of the favorites for the Summer Cup, in
which he has 7st. 111 b. He did nearly all
the leading and came home, untroubled, two
lengths ahead of Resource (10 to 1) in 2min.
32sec. for the 12 furlongs; Bonaventure (25
to 1) cut Fondant (12 to 1) out of third
place in the last few strides. Honan ran
more kindly for Williams, a small appren-
tice, than he has done for more noted joc-
keys, but he may have returned to his former
bad habits by the time the Christmas handi-
caps come round.
Both divisions of the Camden Handicap,
a six-furlong,event, were very much in favor
of McShortodds. In one Singlespear (8 to
1) got home comfortably from Lilah and
Persuasion (each 5 to 1) ; in the other
Ascalon (12 to 1) just managed to beat
Somnolent (6 to 1) and Jazz Baby (9 to 2).
Quixotic, a 7-to-4 favorite for this division,
was in a winning position in the straight,
but cut it at the finish; he is an aged stal-
lion and has evidently grown tricky. But
the ring rejoiced most over the result of
the Kirkham Stakes for two-year-olds, which
went to Elizabeth’s March (33 to 1), owned
by John “Baron” Brown. John’s filly
(she is by March Along-Quarneta) is
trained at the Farm by I. 11. Andrews, as
also is Style (6 to 1), who was beaten into
third place, the favorite, Gold Tinge (5 to
4)’ separating them. These are the things
that try punters’ souls.

Piles of Sydney money went on Spaghetti
for the Great Northern Cup at Newcastle,
but it stayed in the bags, the Polycrates
gelding never emerging from, the ruck. Obey
(14 to 1), a Charlemagne 11. mare who had
failed in maiden-plate company on metropoli-
tan courses, won nicely from Illuminate, an-
other outsider, and Red Kennedy. She proved
to like a bit of distance, and the same might
be true of other maiden-platers and novice-
handicappers. Tallyman, a son of the former
crack jockey of that name, had the mount.

Fields were large and favorites untrust-
worthy at the V.R.C. Benevolent Fund
meeting, held at Moon.ee Valley on Saturday.
Backers suffered their first reverse when
Arausio (33 to 11, a Nassau gelding trained
by Dick Bradfield for V. A/ 1 T. C. committee-
man Clive Leonard, bobbed up in the two-
year-old race, and Duke Traquair (4 to 1)
failed them in the Welter, though he ran
a good third to Donace (10 to 1) and
Waranton (9 to 2). Waranton, who had the
steadier of 11s. 51b. struck a bit of trouble
and then was beaten by a mere head. Don-
ace, who was ridden by Knevitt, is a member
of the Sarchedon family ; Dave Price trains
him for Tookarby’s owner F. W. Kitchen.
For the Fund Handicap, which was the
chief event of the afternoon, backers made
Smoke Bomb favorite at 4 to 1, David Gar-
rick and Bard of Avon being at fives and
Ograb and Spearset at sixes. But Noscitur
(12 to 1) had them all beaten a furlong
from home, and “S. A. Rawdon’s” consistent
noddy won by a couple of lengths from Spear-
set, David Garrick, on whom Scanlon rode
a rather too eager race, being a neck away
third. Noscitur is by Reputation—Lady
Wallace, and is about the best of that good
mare's offspring ; he is trained by Adam Skir-
ving, who has been associated with “Raw-
don” for many years. Jacky Daniels, who
was on Noscitur, completed a double by rid-
ing Harvest Gold (8 to 1) to victory in the
Welter Purse. Diamond Plume (5 to 1),
who was worthless in Sydney, but has come
good in Melbourne, scored in the Highweiglit
Handicap from Who’s Mistake (14 to 1)
and TJquee (10 to 1) ; on the previous Satur-

By 25 votes to 16 Vic. Assembly declared
for the second reading of the Hogan Gov-
ernment’s Tote Legalisation Bill. Fourteen
members paired, and eight did not bother
about voting. The debate was the poorest
that has ever been heard on the subject;
if the shades of Jack Murray, a tote cham-
pion, and Frank Madden, a strong opponent
of the machine, were hovering around they
must have regretted their visit to the scene
they for years adorned. There is still a
danger of the measure being shelved in the
Uppah Chambah. Seventeen members of
that House have to face their electors in
June, and a dozen of them are not sure
whether their electors —a very small mino-
rity altogether—want the machine, though
the general public certainly does.
* * * *
“Min to”: The gullibility of some people
is astounding. Riding home from Rosehill
(N.S.W.) in a race train recently, one of
the "heads” noticed a huge bewhiskered in-
dividual sleeping peacefully in a corner of
the carriage. Donning a train-guard’s cap
which he had conjured from somewhere, he
crossed over to the slumberer and woke
him. “Wliat weight are you?” asked the
“head” authoritatively. "Sixteen stone,” was
the answer. “Well, you’re two stone over-
weight,” said the “head,” “and I’ll have to
charge you a dollar excess.” The big man
meekly ' produced five shillings, which the
“head” pocketed. I’d like to know the
address of the apothecary who supplied him
with his nerve tonic.

“Bruce Highe”: When is a thoroughbred
stallion at his best as a sire? An English
student of equine eugenics, without answer-
ing in precise terms, is inclined to plump
for the elderly moke., and includes in his
list some examples of interest to Australians.
Toxopliilite, who sired Musket, was 11
years old at the time. Musket got .Carbine
when he was 18 years old, and Carbine
became the papa of Wallace in 1891, when
“Old Jack” was seven. Y.ot he sired a
great horse and sire in Spearmint when he
was IS. Spearmint in his turn begat
Cykion when he was seven and Spearhead
three years later. Spearhead was nine years
old when he got Spearfelt, while Cykion was
13 years old when he imprinted his image
on Trivalve. Wallace was 14 years old when
he got Trafalgar, his best son.
Hi ❖ *
“The O’Rook”: A new regulation issued
under the Queensland Racecourses Act
obliges every licensed bookmaker to render
a monthly return of credit bets. The de-
parture is worthy of imitation by the Gov-
ernments of other States. For one thing, it
would tend to choke off the habitual credit
bettor. If a civil servant or a bank clerk,
for example, knew that his name and full
particulars of his transactions went in under
the eye of authority every month, liis enthusi-
asm would weaken. Credit betting is a
rotten system, anyway. It may be a con-
venience to a few big owners and profes-
sional punters, but it is a trap for mugs and
desperate adventurers.
* * * *
“Flail” : It is not often that a clergyman
takes a jockey’s seat in the saddle as a text
for his sermon, but it happened the other
day in Maoriland. Rev. Calder, known as
“the Sporting Parson,” preached from the
text at the funeral of a jockey who had been
killed at Takapuna races; he pointed out
that five jockeys had gone out in the same
fashion in the Auckland district within five
years, and gave it as his opinion that the
craze for the, monkey-on-the-stick seat was
largely responsible. All horsemen will agree
with the padre that the crouching seat on
the withers makes it almost impossible for
a boy to control his nag properly, and that
the slightest bump, when in this position,
is liable to send the*rider flying, but it is
Questionable whether there were fewer acci-
dents in the days of the seat with the long
leathers than there are now. The long stir-
rup-leather did not save Alec Robertson or
Donald Nicholson, and dozens of other cases
could be quoted. The remedy lies in better
training for the boys and a strict ban on,
the practice of bustling for positions in a
packed field. Cutting or jamming in at all
costs in the endeavor to get inside berths
from the riders who have drawn them causes
the great majority of racing accidents.
M. (and Rafferty) Rules
Reg Trowern, the Maoriland welter-
weight, has fought his way to popularity
since he decided on having a shot at Syd-
ney’s scrappers; and he kept up his reputa-
tion by neatly outpointing the navy cham-
pion, Wally Hancock, at Leichhardt on Fri-
day night. At lOst. 5-lib. Reg. was half a
pound lighter than the seafaring youth, who
began well and led for the first five rounds.
Then Trowern commenced adding that little
bit that makes for a favorable final account-
ing. ' He was dropped in the ninth round,
but not so as to hurt him seriously, and the
setback seemed to inspire him ; he piled up
points, particularly in the last four rounds,
and earned ‘a clean-cut award, though not
by any wide margin.
* . * * *
Maorilander Charlie Purdy, half a pound
lighter than Bob Miller, of Ireland, who
tipped the beam at 9st. 101 b., outpointed his
rival at Sydney Stadium on Monday night.
Miller* has oceans of pluck and carries a
hard slam to the body when he can get it
home, but he was far behind the other chap
when it came to boxing and there was no
cavilling at the decision at the end of the
15 rounds. The shift from Friday to Mon-
day for the bigger fights was evidently
appreciated, for the audience was bigger
than has been seen lately.
“8.M.”: Purdy is the cleverest boxer in
Australia now that Grime is away, and it is
easy to understand how he bothered Billy
in their fight at Wellington early in this
year. If there is any big money in boxing
nowadays, Charlie should be in it up to his
neck.

Neither principal in Melbourne Stadium’s
Monday show was made in Australia;
Tommy Mclnnes hails from Scotland and
Billy Harms from South Africa. Weights
were given at list. 4flb., and list. sflb.,
respectively. The argument was more rugged
than spectacular. The small crowd disliked
Bill’s claiming tendencies and said so.
Tommy scored heavily in the inside work
with short arm jolts, but Harms,' though
weakened by loss of blood from a’ gashed
eye and lip, showed plenty of pluck. Down
for nine in the eleventh, he came back well
and took the honors in a toe-to-toe go in
the fourteenth, only to lose in the end on
points. The Scot deserves fatter purses
than he has received in Australia.
Racquet and Bawl
“Cut Shot”: The Victorians did better in
the State tennis championships than they
had done in the inter-State affair with
N. S. Wales. lan Mclnnes surprised the
visitors from Sydney by beating Ilopman in
straight sets; then he overcame Moon, the
Queenslander. But he met his master in
Crawford, who won by 3-6, 6-4, 6-2, 6-4,
having previously defeated Rowe, the South
Australian, in a hot four-set match: 4-6,
6-2, 6-4, 12-10. R. O. Cummings also dis-
tinguished himself in ihe early rounds
and set Gerald Patterson a stiff task
in thq semi-final; indeed it looked for a
time as if the big fellow was gone. But
with grim determination he made, up his
leeway in the fourth set, and the fifth was
comparatively easy for him : 2-6, 6-2, 3-6, 8-6,
6- The final between Crawford and Pat-
terson provided a mighty battle, with the
Victorian the winner: 7-5, 6-1, 5-7, 1-6,
7- Patterson was at his top, and mixed
his strokes much more than usual, making
frequent use of his chop shots; Crawford,
for his part, played very fine tennis after a
shaky start. Rain and wind inconvenienced
the . players somewhat, but there was no
advantage either way.
In the doubles Crawford and Hopman
were unexpectedly beaten by Sclilcsingcr and
Mclnnes, while Patterson and llawkes
accounted for Hone and Rowe in straight
sets. The mixed doubles were won by
Hawkes and Miss Boyd, Moon and Miss
Cox meeting them in the final. Miss Boyd
proved decidedly superior to Miss Akhurst
in the singles, and was successful, with Mrs.
Harper, in the doubles:'

“15-30": Crawford’s defeat of Haw'kes and
Patterson in the Vic.-N.S.W. tourney wasn’t
allowed to pass without some miserable
attempts to apologise for the Victorians.
The allegation that they were not in form
was freely distributed by sporting writers,
who, being members of the Vic. L.T.A. and
friends of the vanquished, could not look
upon the achievement of the young Corn-
stalk with an unprejudiced eye. To my
knowledge Hawkes had been practising freely
before the event, and Patterson had also
spent a lot of time at the nets.

“15.30” : Whilst Melbourne tennis writers
were cackling about Moon, Hone and Hop-

Innes, who was not -even mentioned as a
possible, calmly banged the trio out of the
championship. In each match the young
Melbourne doctor exhibited grace and
strength in every movement, and his win
over Moon, after the sturdy young Queens-
lander had led by two sets to love on a
damp,, dead court, revealed a genius for
recovery which was presumed to be the
special monopoly of Gerald Patterson. The
trouble with Mclnnes is that he can’t devote
the requisite amount of time to the game. If
he were in the tennis-goods business he
would be among the champions.

“Bisque”: Brisbane, which has been
suffering from a violent eruption of golf
clubs, has acquired a new lawn-tennis club,
which intends to cater for the game in a
fashion to which even the management of
the White City courts in Sydney cannot
hope to aspire. Eleven courts have been
laid out; one, to be reserved for champion-
ships and the like, is immediately in front
of the clubhouse, which, wdiat with balconies
and verandahs and sloping banks covered
with seats, will accommodate a large number
of spectators. The other courts are on two
levels connected by a grass ramp, Last,
but not worst, the clubhouse is to be equipped
with the tennis equivalent of the golfer’s
nineteenth hole. Queensland has a more
catholic outlook on such matters than N.S.W.

“Kayeff”: Touching the “soft ball” that
“Iluffin-Guttin” (B. 17/11/’27) despises.
Trying a new racket, I “loaned on” a ball
which came to me at a favorable height for
a drive. The chap with whom I was practis-
ing committed the great tennis “don’t” —
lie took his eye off the ball. The “soft”
missile took him fairly on the solar plexus,
and he folded up like a concertina. But,
then, he was only a six-footer and we were
playing just below the equator, so perhaps
he couldn’t stand much.

“Slop”: The fierce light that beats upon
the modern tennis star, especially the young
female of the species, respects no privacy.
The other day Joan Fry, one of the numerous
flapper champions with whom England hopes
to regain its tennis prestige, became engaged.
TURF ITEM.
“When called, upon Sylvia failed to respond.”
Since then the cables have been running hot
with syndicated stories about the male party
to the contract. They have left unturned no
item of his career, from his manner of earn-
ing a living to his taste in socks. Things
have reached the stage where a tennis girl
can’t take a husband or an ice-cream soda
without the fact being broadcast to the
uttermost ends of the earth.
“Cut Shot”: For the 1928 Davis Cup con-
test 25 entries have been received, including,
one from this country—the first since 1925.
France, having won the Cup, will conduct
the draw for the qualifying rounds; the Pre-
sident of the Republic himself will officiate,
following the precedent set by U.S. Presi-
dent Coolidge. We may yet see Bruce or
even Theodore or Lang dipping into the
lucky-bag in this country. It doesn’t look
as if King George is likely to get a chance
for a long time to come.
The Ins and Outs
Helped by slackness in the field, the Vic.
batsmen predominated in the match
against South Aus. at Adelaide. Woodfull
(43) and Ponsford set the scoring going, the
captain leaving when 97 was on the board.
Ponsford, partnered by Hendry, took his
score to 133 before Whitcombe caught him
off fast-bowler Ilalcombe. Hendry plodded
on with Ryder’s assistance, and when stumps
were drawn on the first day two wickets were
down for 305. Ryder opened out on Satur-
day and went at last for 70, l.b.w. to Grim-
mett, who was bowling well but having cruel
luck with the catches. Hendry had another
life at 125, and stayed until he had made
168, being caught by Ilalcombe off Wil-
liams. Hartkopf (111 n. 0.) and Blackie
(55) flogged the now-tired bowling, and 646
was up for eight wickets at the close of the
second day.
Woodfull applied the closure on Monday,
and South Aus. had to bat on a wet wicket
rapidly drying. Disaster came early, and
the innings closed for 177, Morton taking
4 wickets for 35 and Ironmonger 5 for 50.
By far the best batting performance was
young Whitfield’s 4S, made against odds
in 100 minutes—a good first appearance in
Shield games.
X * * *
With a first-innings win over N. S. Wales
at Brisbane, Queensland made a satisfactory
start on the long Sheffield Shield programme.
Bad weather necessitated a delay of two
days; then Queensland increased its score
from 8 for 354 to 419, Rowe remaining
unconquered with 128 —his first century in
inter-State cricket. N.S.W. began disas-
trously, three wickets falling for 11; and
then Jackson left, having made 2. Kippax
(28) and Watson (32) saved a collapse, but
seven were down for 121 when N.S.W. entered
on the last day’s play of 2\ hours. Jordan
(35 n. 0.) did his best to make a draw of it,
but the innings ended for 167. Following on,
N.S.W. lost Jordan and Everett for 22 runs.
Hurwood, a right-hand-medium spin bowler,
took five N.S.W. wickets for 50 in the first
innings and one for 6 in the second—a splen-
did performance for a young fellow in his
first Sheffield Shield match. Left-hander
Hornibrook got two for 26, while Ron Oxen-
ham followed up his score of 63 with two
for 64. Amos snapped up three catches in
the slips and took one wicket for 11.
“Bowen Park”: Though the
question of the Queensland Test
match has been settled, W. A.
Oldfield has found a reason for
cancelling the fixture, if can-
celled it can be. Writing in S.
M. Herald, he falls foul of the
Brisbane wicket. In the N.S.W.-
Queensland match, it seems, the
bowling kicked and one batsman
was hit on the head by a bump-
ing ball. Therefore the wicket
is not fit for a Test match, and
Brisbane’s Test should be given
to pore old Sydney, where
wickets never kick or beaten
teams squeal. As a matter of
fact, the Brisbane Exhibition
wicket, laid down with the same
soils as Sydney Cricket Ground,
is as good a pitch as any in Aus-
tralia, as dozens of visiting
teams, including the last English-
men. have often stated, while it
has been examined and approved
as up to Test standard by proper
authority. If the wicket was as
bad as Oldfield imagines, it is
difficult to see any side making
419 on it, as Queensland did, and
adding 58 of those for the last
wicket, one of the batsmen being
Amos, who in Sydney was never
regarded as a batsman’s bootlace.
If the Northern State can make
scores like that on a bad wicket,
there will be trouble ahead for
someone when it gets on a good
one.
“Centurion”: The death of George Giffen
in Adelaide, at 68, removes one of the
greatest of cricketers, and one round whom
revolve more quaint stories than are told
of any other Australian contemporary. Most
of these centred in George’s alleged inability
to give up the ball once he had begun bowl-
ing, and certainly no man would have more
eagerly welcomed the eight-ball over had it
come in his day. But it must be remembered
that for many years he had to do the bulk
of the bowling for his State; then the man
was tireless, and dangerous always. It is
debatable whether he or Noble was the
greater all-rounder. Perhaps the palm should
go to Noble, who was a wonderful skipper,
which Giffen was not; but the South Aus-
tralian was unquestionably in the first class
as bowler, batsman and fieldsman. The
feature of his bowling was his power of
flighting the ball, in which no bowler has
ever excelled him. He went to England in
1882, ’B4, ’B6, ’93 and ’96 and was invited
to go on two other occasions. On three
tours he made over 1000 runs and took over
100 wickets.
“Skyrider”: George Giffen never cared
tuppence for public
opinion. Time and
again while he
plugged away at
a tough opponent
the fickle crowd
would yell “Take
yourself off,
Georg e,” but
George was deaf
and blind to every-
thing but the
“spot.” Presently
he would strike it,
and the barrackers’
tunc would change
as wicket after
after wicket rattled
down. Like Turner,
Palmer and others
of his day, he had
a beautiful de-
livery, and to me
it was always a
pleasure to watch
him, even when he
wasn’t getting
wickets. And no
stroke came amiss
to him as a bats-
man, although he
wasn’t exactly a
stylist. Cricket was
the one passion of
Giffen’s life he
never married.
When he grew too
old for the game he
coached youngsters
in the Adelaide
parks without
thought of reward,
a practice he con-
tinued to within a
few weeks of his
death.
“Shrewsbury” : Dacre, the dashing Maori-
land batsman, who gave N.S.W. a taste of
his quality at the Sydney Cricket Ground
last month, has accepted an offer made to him
by the Gloucestershire County Club, and will
throw in his lot with the county of the
Graces as a professional. He should do well
in England, where his fast-moving methods
found high favor. He played 34 innings ror
the Maorilanders in England, making 1070
runs, with a highest score of 176 and an
average of 31.47. He also topped the bowling
averages with 8 wickets for 16.62 runs each.
Midwinter, like Dacre, an Englishman by
birth, played with the western county after
visiting England with the Australian elevens
of IS7B and 1884.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Colonel Damurize”: Life in China may
have its dangers for the European, but there
are compensations. In an account of the
Fab Tien golf course, some miles from Hong
Ivong, it is stated that in addition to the bar
in the club-house there is one at the fourth
hole which “has to be encountered three
times on the round.” The name of the course
architect is not mentioned, but it should be
recorded in letters of gold in every other
clubhouse in the Empire. At Fan Tien he
needs no more monument that Sir Chris-
topher Wren does in St. Paul’s.
* * * *
“Q.N.”: Eloquent testimony to the hold
that golf has obtained in Victoria is fur-
nished by the Railway Commissioners. They
have issued a booklet describing the various
courses in the State and giving minute direc-
tions as to how they may be reached,

“Ploughman”: N.S.W. golfers are to
witness an interesting challenge match at
Rose Bay to-morrow and Saturday—a four-
some for £lOO, Tommy Howard and W.
Corry v. V. James and Walter Clark. The
thing is an innovation as far as N. S. Wales
is concerned, but matches of the kind, for
large stakes are a commonplace of British
and Continental golf, and in America pros,
like Kirkwood and Hagen tour the country
battling for prizes offered by clubs anxious
for publicity.

“Baffy”: Though local knowledge should
have helped them, Manly players had to
accept defeat in the club’s open foursomes
on Saturday. Honors were taken by the
Killara pair, R. J. Withycombe and H. H.
Wright, who went round in 81—42 out
and 39 in. G. Thompson and A. N. Brown,
of Bonnie Doon, were only a stroke worst'
for second place. Footballers G. Wyld and
T. Smith, minus 12, won the handicap event
with a net score of 79; Withycombe and
Wright, minus one, were second.

mud also gives it prominence, and a third
attraction is its addiction to golf, for it
possesses one of the best courses in Queens-
land. The feature of its golfing season is
the big Christmas tournament, and this year
the City of Red Mud intends to outshine
itself. The tourney will last from December
24 to Jan. 2, and covers pretty well every
description of golf match and competition for
both sexes. A big influx of southern golfers
is expected.

“The McHaggis”: Recognising that not
even the claims of the Sawbath can alto-
gether over-ride the obsession of golf, the
San Francisco Presbyterians have re-
solved to meet the Auld Yin half
way. They have purchased a large
block of land abutting on one of the
most popular Californian golf courses, and
will build thereon a church where special
services wall be held for the benefit of players.
These services will be arranged so as to
catch the Sabbath-breaker before he drives
off from the first tee and give him a chance
to hole out in the collection-plate.

“Owl”: The fad for miniature golf
courses (8,17/11/’27)) is increasing every-
where, and in France they are now equipped
for night playing. The course is surrounded
with painted canvas scenery, protected by
wire netting, and is lit by electric lamps of
3000 candle-power. Arnauld Massey, the
French champion, is responsible for the new
idea, and is running the latest version in the
Forest of Marly, near Paris. The course has
turfed bunkers of the same type as those
on full-sized courses, and approaching, as
well as driving njnd putting, can be prac-
tised with advantage on it.

“Divot Digger”: The dates for the 1928
Australian golf championships, which, to the
inconvenience of the State associations and
the leading clubs, have been unconscionably
delayed, have now been published. The
series will begin at the Royal Sydney Club’s
course at Rose Bay on September 3. That
being known, the States and the clubs can
get on with the arranging of their own pro-
grammes. Queensland has not waited for
the tardy central authorities; its Darling
Downs championship is fixed for May 5.

“Clievroford”: Lots of motor tours round
Australia or portion of Australia get
into the newspapers, but there are lots that
don’t. At Nyah, on the Vic. bank of the
Murray, a youth casually informed me that
he had motored, with a pal, in a single-
seater to Cairns (N.Q.) and back. Part of
the way they had to make their own track
through the ranges, and one stretch without
water measured 300 miles. Again, being
on the box-seat of a Melbourne suburban
I commiserated with the driver
on the monotony of his job. He didn't need
my sympathy. Not long ago he drove a
car from Toowoomba (Q.) to Geraldton
(W.A). placarding the continent with a
certain well-known ad.

“Brass Tacks”: A motor-car reliability
test which has ordinary stunts of the kind
looking like change for threepence, regarded
from the point of view of general utility,
is reported from Queensland. A party of
five left Burketown, on the Gulf of Car-
pentaria, for Brisbane in a Dodge car. The
distance is 1381 miles as the ’plane flies,
and the first few hundred miles is through
some of the roughest country in creation.
The*first day’s run was to Cloucurry, 256
miles, which was reached at sundown ; push-
ing on, the party pitched camp 390 miles
from the start. They covered 380 miles
the next day, and in spite of rain and heavy
roads did 393 the next. After a five hours’
stop at Toowoomba, Brisbane was reached
at 6 p.m. on the fourth day out. Actual
running time was 57 hours, making the
hourly mileage rate a little over 24. No
adjustment to the car was necessary on the
drip, and petrol mileage worked out at 22
per gallon. The return journey was to have
been tackled after a ten-days’ cool-off in
Brisbane.

“Humpybong”: Not content with the
usual club * reliability contests, Queensland
motorists have started inter-city affairs,
which are rousing a' lot of interest. The
latest was a petrol-consumption test among
Toowoomba, Gympie and Brisbane owners
of Overland Whippets; it was held at Too-
woomba. Each competitor (there were 10)
was given a quart of petrol and despatched
to do the best he could on the meagre allow-
ance. The winner was F. Scanlan, of Too-
woomba, driving C. A. V. Neilsen’s car; he
covered 25.15 miles on his quart, wliich
worked out at 100.6 miles per gallon. The
lowest mileage was 68.3, and the average for
the field was 84.11.

“Garry”: The most exciting revelation in
the published details of the new Ford car
is the price in America —395 dollars, or
about £B3 at current rate of exchange. Qf
course by the time it gets here it will cost
a great deal more than that. There were
rumors that Henry has been playing with
the notion of an infinitely variable hydraulic
gear and drive, but if lie lias he has evi-
dently got over it. The engine is said to be
rated 40b.h.p., which doesn’t tell much.
If, as is claimed, the car does 30 miles to
the gallon of petrol it can’t have an R.A.O.
rating of much over 12h.p., and it must be
a light job to attain 65 m.p.h. with so small
an engine.
* * * *
“Sprocket”: With the approach of the
Olympiad, the Continental practice of allow-
ing amateur and professional cyclists to
compete against each other in races is giving
trouble again. Prior to the Paris affair in 1924
American and British competitors objected
to riding against men who had just been
competing with pros. The French body,
which is the most flagrant offender, promised
to remedy the anomaly, but nothing has been
done. It is difficult for English-speaking
cyclists to distinguish between a Continental
amateur and a professional. The distinc-
tion seems to exist in name only.
“Brom” : Hubert Opperman (B. l/12/’27)
learnt his biking as a messenger-boy deliver-
ing meat for his father, then a butcher in the
Bendigo district. Opperman’s young muscles
were hardened by the effort to drive himself
and 10 or a dozen pounds of corned-beef and
other victuals over the hills adjacent to his
native village, a feat he performed with per-
spiring regularity six days a week. The
strangest thing about him is that, though
lie was brought up with the smell of fresh
and inviting Hands ever in his nostrils, he is
a vegetarian. He practically does his train-
ing on bananas, oranges and green vegetables.

“Heliopolis”: The general utility of the
modern motor-car was well illustrated at
Cairo' latelv by a Studebaker Commander
sedan, which beat 12 other competitors over
a kilometre (0.621 of a mile) in 46 1-5 sec.
The same type of car, in the hands of Ab.
Jenkins, put up a new record for the Atlan-
tic-Pacific run across the continent of
America a few days after. He did the
long run, wffiicli has a good deal of high
climbing included in it, in 77hr. 40min. The
distance, as the crow flies, would be about
3000 miles.
Miscellaneous
The Waratahs put up a couple of sterling
performances in Wales last week. Their first
game against Llanelly was won by 24 points
to 14 after the Welshmen had led by 14 to
6. Llanelly beat the Wallabies and the
second Springboks, and hadn’t been licked
on its own ground since the All Blacks of
1924-25 got home by 8 to 3. In the Satur-
day game against Cardiff the Blues came
home on the bit by 15 points to 9, although
Jack Ford, their best forward, was sent off
in the second half for talking back to the
referee. Sheehan again made a brilliant
showing, and,- as in the Llanelly match, the
pace and combination of the tourists in the
closing rallies was a revelation.
* * * sfc
“Stand Off”: The Waratahs have had
their share of casualties. Malcolm, the New-
castle half, has been out of the team since
the Oxford match, a dislocated shoulder
being the trouble, and Wallace, Jack F'ord,
Blackwood and others have had to stand
down through injury. But Bowers has suf-
fered most; he was so badly knocked about
in the game against Ulster that he is return-
ing to Australia. Bowers, a fast and powerful
wing three-quarter, made a great impression
in the early games, and was level with Eric
Ford in the scoring list (8 tries) at the time
of his retirement. The Wallabies of 1908-09
also lost the services of one of their players
—Peter Flanagan, the Queensland forward.
He was line-umpiring in one of the opening
games when a tackled player collided with
him, and he was picked up with a broken leg.
After he came out of hospital he saw the
tour through as a spectator of his mates’
performances.

“The ’Gabba”: Brisbane is enjoying its
early .experiences of the tin-hare industry,
which include the pursuit of pencillers who
bet “under the lap.” The crowd was giveu
a new thrill by a dog named Quantas, which
had just won a hurdle race and was returned
to the dog pen. As the “hare” started on its
run for the next race, Quantas hopped the
7ft. fence and set out in pursuit with the
other tykes. When he came in after the fin-
ish he got a reception that would have turned
a Q.T.C. Derby winner green with envy.

“Spike”: The opening day of the Dunn
Shield competition at Sydney saw Carlton,
the very promising schoolboy from St.
Joseph’s, figure in the 100-yards champion-
ship. He won the final by a yard in 10
1-lOsec —good time for the Sports Ground
track, but not exactly of the world-beating
order. Hunt, whom the lad beat by a yard,
took the ouarter-mile in 50 2-ssec., upsetting
W. H. PONSFORD, the Victorian run-
getting machine, who began his Sheffield
Shield season with a score of 133
against South Australia at Adelaide.
“Slip” Carr’s record for this event by a
fifth of a second. In the mile, J. A. Martin
won in 4min. 33 1-5 sec., a second better
than the previous Shield record, which had
stood since 1913. E. IT. Scott’s 15 7-10 sec.
for the 120 yards hurdles cracked both the
State and Dunn Shield records of 15 4-ssec.
“Light Horse”: Duntroon College has
captured the Lafferty Cup, which is
competed for annually by military colleges
throughout the Empire. Duntroon won the
mile and relay races and was second in
swimming and the high jump, scoring 14
points. Sandhurst, which had carried off the
bauble for six years running, was second
with 12 points, the Canadian college was
third with 9 points and Woolwich was last.
A. J. A. BOWERS, the speedy and hard
running Waratah wing-three quarter,
who has been compelled to return to
Australia through injuries received in
the match with Ulster.
“Cash Amateur”: Though the British
Olympic Council has reluctantly decided to
send a team to Amsterdam rather than
back out over the part-payment-to-amateurs
question, it intends to fight the innovation to
a standstill, and will insist on the cessation
of “broken-time” payments after this Olym-
piad is over. In that case, the position of
N.S.W., which has declared itself in favor
of part-payment, will be peculiar. It will
be at variance with the Federal Olympic
Council, which is backing the British atti-
tude, and if it persists in its contumacy it
may have to toe the mat. No one who
wants to see amateur sport preserved will
have much sympathy for the movement in
favor of part-payment, which will inevitably
end in whole payment and the revival of
all the smellful old scandals attendant on
professional athletics and professional
games. Probably Noo South does not itself
desire it, but has yielded to its incurable
tendency to have a crack at the Federal
authority, whatever it may happen to be.

“Loom”: Sydney’s sixth Henley regatta
on the Leichhardt canal provided some good
rowing and, incidentally, gave Mosman a
chance to recover the prestige it had lost
when Leichhardt beat it in the State cham-
pion fours. In the race for senior eights'll.
L. Callaghan’s crew won all the way from
Sydney, which had a ding-dong battle with
Haberfield for second place; Leichhardt did
not compete. The time for the mile was
4min. 11 l-ssec. Haberfield beat Sydney by
three lengths in the light senior fours, and J.
Ivessell won the Henley Sculls.

Q. M. Deloitte, “the Father of Rowing,”
celebrated his 85th birthday last week, to the
tune of congratulations from watermen in
every quarter of the continent. A native
of N. S. Wales, he learned to handle an
oar on that famous nursery of oarsmen the
Parramatta River, winning his first sculling
race thereon when he was 16. From then
until his retirement from the active side of
the game in 1870 he won many rowing
events; one of these was as a member of
a crew that defeated a crew from the
U.S.A. warship Ivearsage, which a few years
previously had sunk the Alabama in the
historic duel in the English Channel. The
veteran’s services to rowing, to which he
has practically devoted the latter part of
his life, can hardly be estimated, and his
influence and repute in the sport he loves
extend far beyond the confines of his native
State, and, indeed, of Australia.

“Surf Board”: Something new in athletic

carry more weight if they were backed by

bank considers that Australian-made paper is
not suitable, surely its requirements could
be met by English manufacturers.

Bulletin, is actually doing a great public
service with his guinea-pig farm at Brighton
(Vic.), although municipal council and resi-
dents persist in regarding him as a public

or pathologists of seven of the leading hos-
pitals in Melbourne affirm that Miller’s
'pigs are indispensable in the diagnosis of
certain cases of consumption, as well as in
other diseases.

“P.X.”: Actually the N.S.W. Cremation
Co., Ltd., made a profit last year—£2o9 on
working, reduced to £4 after allowing for
depreciation and other charges. The Cre-
matorium was opened at the end of May,
1925; since then there have been 304 cre-
mations, 175 of them last year. The cre-
mation fees were £llO3, so the cost seems to
have been a shade over £6 per body. But
of course, there is no grave to dig or ground
to buy—the latter a fearfully expensive
item at the “fashionable” corpse-yards nowa-
days. Some progress is being made by the
sanitary reform; but it is painfully slow.

so much new stock had been sent to London,
seeing that the total sales last year amounted
to a mere £l5, Mines Minister Jones said
that the market had greatly improved and
that agents had cabled for further supplies.
This sounds well, but diggers who can sell
only a certain proportion of their “catch”
to the Government, and have to wait indefin-
itely for a dividend, would rather have the
banned private buyer, paying cash on the
nail, even if he shaves his prices.

“Slcyrider”: Sydney Suburbia is finding
that estate-agents have uses other than in
the mere selling of houses and land. I asked
Mrs. Dash if Thursday would be a con-
venient dav to call. “I’m afraid I’ll be out
on Thursday,” was the reply; “I’m going
put to look at a house.” “But you’re not
selling your nice cottage, are you?” I pro-
ceeded. “Heavens, no!” said Mrs. Dash.
“But Mr. Realty has a lovely car, and it’s
so interesting to see other people’s homes.”

“Kwinana”: “H.D.C.” (B. 10/11/’27)
notwithstanding, the Thursday Island tele-
graph line, with the exception of a _ small
patch between Cape York and Mein, is gal-
vanised, and so are the Cooktown and Gulf
lines. T.I. has just completed another spasm
of telegraphic isolation extending over six
weeks. Certainly traffic was sent through
the radio-stations, but T.I. wants direct
radio with Brisbane, and its case is un-
answerable. Repairs to the cable connecting
the island with the mainland must have run
away with far more than the cost of erect-
ing a small short-wave wireless plant.

“Athol” : There is money still to be made
out of flats in Sydney—mostly by _ selling
them. The whole art of success in flat-
building is to beat the other fellow with the
gadgets you put in. Accommodation doesn't
count alongside “labor-saving devices.” _ A
year or so ago the salesman took you into
tl:e bathroom first and showed you the cun-
ning little place for stowing soap or some-
thing of the sort. Next lighting ffiad a turn,
and you had to have a power-point in every
room. Now some cold-storage, fixing is the
really swish thing. It runs you into 80
or 90 pounds, but it lifts your flat right out
of the mob.

“Avon”: Maoriland, which last year im-
ported nearly £5,000,000 worth more than
the value of its exports, and suffered from
a slump in prices and a general scarcity of
money in consequence, has tightened its belt
by a couple of holes. In the 10 months
ended October last year the excess of im-
ports over exports was £2,721,000. This
year for the same period exports exceed im-
ports by close on £8,000,000. Most of the
explanation can be put in one sentence. The
banks raised the overdraft rate.

150 Automotive Engineers
Could Agree on an Ideal Car
Wouldn’t you like to own that car?
They Have"-,

The Metropolitan Section of the Society
of Automotive Engineers held a contest
in January for the design of an “Ideal
Car.”
1 50 automotive engineers competed for
the prize. The specifications submitted
by the contestants were synthetized into
a composite set of specifications for an
“Ideal Car” —that dream of all engineers
—that hope of all automobile owners.

in almost every detail the Flying Cloud speci-
fications are exactly similar to those of the
Engineer’s Ideal Car. This partly explains
the phenomenal sales of the Flying Cloud in
America since its introduction in January
last.
Named after the well-known American
Clipper, the Flying Cloud, famed in the middle
of last century for her speed and graceful
lines, the Flying Cloud car brings to motor-
dom a new idea of car performance.
The Flying Cloud is a pleasure car, low slung
with clean sweeping lines, capable of ex-
tremely rapid acceleration and high sustained
speed. This car will give to every motorist that
“something” which his own good car lacks.

STOCKINGS
Has anybody noticed the increase of the
afternoon wedding? Among Sydney’s upper
crust the register is now always signed by
daylight. Moira Brady will follow this
fashion when she marries her gallant Cap-
tain Broadliurst early in January. Her sis-
ter, Mrs. E. J. Watt, after a three or four
years’ residence in London, is popping over
for the event.
An afternoon flooded with sunlight was
Nature’s wedding present to Margaret Osborne,
who went on father’s arm to wed Ellis
Feilding Jones under the gaze of all her
world. St. Mark’s, at Darling Point, the
toniest of our marriage smithies, had been
engaged to weld the link, which Canon Lea
adjusted with the .ease born of long experi-
ence. The pillars of the pictorial old church
were twined with blue hydrangea and pink
Dorothy Perkins—a fitting color-scheme for
the slim bride’s fair looks. Another effect
of charm was in the chancel border of
Madonna lilies, white Japanese iris and blue
hydrangea. The pews were filled with the
brilliant Locking and perfect tailoring of
260 guests. The bride’s frock, over which
thought and money had been poured, was a
classic swathe of deep ivory satin, unadorned
but exquisitely draped. The bodice was cut
in a low square back and front and was
sleeveless. Layers and layers of tulle, like
fresh-beaten white of egg, formed the top
train, which veiled an under-train of white-
gold tissue. Down one side was draped a
flounce of cobwebby old lace, while the other
side showed a deep hem of tulle darned in
white-gold thread. The veil, which had been
worn by an Osborne bride three generations
back, was of Brussels-point lace in square
effect, and was secured to the blonde hair
with a diamond brooch. A string of pearls,
from which a cross of sapphires and
diamonds hung, and a bouquet of golden
orchids rounded off the whole.
The three cousins, Judith and Beryl
Osborne and Adrienne Acland (M.L.), who
’maided, wore frocks of white gold tissue
over sky-blue georgette. The bodices were
sleeveless and worn with beige suede gloves
that ended just below the elbow. The skirts
caused a gasp. They were formed of shaped
tiers of tissue over georgette ending just
below the knee in front and tapering to
ankles at the back, forming the new swallow-
tail effect. With them were worn Lindbergh
caps of white gold tissue, with heron mounts
in three shade of delphinium-blue, the deeper
shade forming the ear flaps. Little Bettina
Manning, mostly a huge butterfly bow and
frills of tulle and wearing a Mercury-Lind-
bergh cap, kept a guiding hand on the expen-
sive train. Tall Captain Penfold was best
man and Henry Ritchie and Robert Osborne
groomsmen. Later, at the Rose Bay Golf
Club, Margaret’s mother, Mrs. 'Stuart
Osborne, smiled above beige pink satins and
a posy of red roses. Margaret is the only
daughter of the Stuart Osbornes, of Huglien-
den, Point Piper, and grand-daughter on the
maternal side of rich James Watson, of
Glanworth. The groom, who on his mother’s
side is a connection of the Friends, is the
only son of Mr. and Mrs. E. Feilding Jones,
of Rhode Island, U.S.A.
Into the usual picturesque setting for a
Jewish wedding, Beryl Walker stepped one
night last week. The Great Synagogue,
blazing with electrics and perfumed with
masses of flowers, gave its blessing to Hie
inter-State alliance—the groom is Dr.
Nathan Dennerstein, of Collins-street, Mel-
bourne. Ava Berkman and Kitty Owen were
the two rose-pink maids who followed the
bride, and a small flower-girl and a tiny
page attended the Honiton-lace train-—a
graceful afterthought to the wedding gar-
ment of rich white satin, silver lace and dia-
mente and crystal. Mr. and Mrs. Joseph
Walker, the bride’s parents, gave the recep-
tion at the Ambassadors.
A great-great-granddaughter of that
Governor King who did the State he had
governed the honor of afterwards settling
in it was married last week in St. John’s
Church at Gordon. She was Ruth Raymond
Lethbridge King, and her bridegroom was
Dr. William Arnold Connolly, of Molong, a
son of padre Arnold Connolly, of the North
Shore line.
Tusculum, the handsome home that
gives an old-world air to the little Potts
Point street that is named after it and was
at one time part of its stretching grounds, is
about to be turned into flats. It was sold
the other day for £2S,UU(J. George Cheeke,
a grandson of the William Ixtng who built
it, is back in Sydney after an absence of 40
years. When he last saw Tusculum it was
like a country home sec in wide gardens and
paddocks. When he went to revisit the
scenes of his childhood he found the cows
and horses and a lucerne paddock of kindly
memory wiped out by closely-built streets
and high flat-buildings. The hand of change,
too, had been heavy on Buckhurst, in Wool-
lahra; but Cfanbrook remains much as it
was in the days when James White owned
it.
When George Cheeke, then a youngster
of 17, left Sydney for England under the
wing of Fitzwilliam Wentworth, a son of
the historic Charles, Sydney had no picture-
shows and no public dancing places. Steam
trams, hansoms and growlers were the mode
of conveyance for those who didn’t own
private carriages, and the shores of the
harbor were green with native bush. Even
the flapper lias changed. Then with her
leg-’o-mutton sleeves, tight waists and trains
she ate her ices and eclairs at Compagnoni’s
or drank her tea at Quong Tart's, or in the
•evening, suitably chaperoned, went to Her
Majesty’s to see Dion Boucicault or Lily
Dampier and George Rignold in a stirring
drama by Charles Reads. Now he finds her
übiquitous, better looking, short-skirted,
sleeveless and neckless, and he declares, after
40 years’ experience of Europe, England and
America, that the Australian girl is the only
one in the world whose legs are beautiful
enough to justify knee-high skirts.
Tall George Cheeke (he is about 6ft.
6in.), who brings an equally tall son—
“young George”—with him, is a grandson on
the paternal side of the Judge Cheeke of
early N. S. Wales history. His home now
is on Vancouver Island, where he owns a
ranch and timber holdings. His mother, it
will be remembered, returned to her native
land after an absence nearly as lengthy
as that of her son, and by a curious coin-
cidence died shortly after she had become a
tenant" of a cottage at Darling Point built
in the garden of the home she had gone to
as a bride.
This is a May Mool’e picture of Grace
Scobie, president of the Professional Women
Workers’ Association, whose frankness,
directness and logic place her amongst the
foremost leaders of Women’s movements in
Australia. Grace is now the centre of a
storm raised
by the omis-
sion o f the
National
Council of
Women to
consult some of
its affiliated so-
cieties before
drawing up its
proposals on
Child - Endow-
ment for the
Royal Com-
mission. At a
special meet-
ing of protest
called by Miss
Scobie, th le
Profe s s i o n a 1
Women Work-
ers disunited
themse-1 ves
from the pro-
pos a 1 s pre-
pared by the National Council. Miss Scobie
contends that the council has not ascer-
tained facts with regard to conditions in
Australia, and therefore is not competent
to give opinions. But, of course, the
sharpest pin-prick is her directness in cen-
suring the council’s action as “overbearing
impertinence.”
The youngest excuse of the Institute of
Journalists for a lunch was the entertain-
ment of a group of Press veterans who each
deserves an entertainment on his own
account. The eight patriarchs could muster
600 years between them. The longest
beard was brought by the 97-year-old
John Gale all the way from Queanbeyan.
The old man, who had his wife with him,
mentioned that he started contributing to a
Welsh paper when he was 15; and he
claimed that, although lie might have become
physically feeble, his mind was still as
bright as ever. Dr. Ward spoke an elegy
about the passing of his generation ; and then
.Tames Edmond wiped the tear from every
eye with a story of his Bulletin experi-
ences. George Black, M.L.C., was another
old Bulletin representative in the group.
Our late G.-G. Forster’s lady keeps in
touch with things Australian by her active
interest in the Victoria League. She has
succeeded Lady Jersey as its president, that
one-time Governor’s lady having at last
begged far a rest. Miss Macarthur Onslow,
who was welcomed home by the Sydney
branch of the V.L. the other afternoon, told
the rustling crowds of our best-dressed met
to greet her at the Women’s Club something
of the league’s work in London and of the
International Council of Women at Geneva.
The latest fashion for lace was demonstrated
pleasingly in the lady's dress, which was
the hue of pale sand over chiffons of the
same cool tone, and girdled with golden-
brown velvet. Dame Mary Cook was wel-
comed,mlso, though the cymbals were not
quite so loudly struck.
Fumbling for lines and hesitancy of action
spoiled the Players' Club’s last productions
and robbed them of all sparkle. This was
lamentably noticeable in Francis Jackson’s
poetic “Caliban in Milan.” In this the
author shows us the monster, whose island
has been destroyed by the magic of Pros-
pero, prisoned in the city of Milan. Awake
to beauty, starving for it, yet denied it,
Caliban lias decided that beauty which is
magic and the result of book learning must
be destroyed. He is the furious leader of a
plot against Prospero ; but Miranda, who is
to him the personification of all beauty, he
loves sufficiently in the end to be destroyed
for her. The well-known Red Page writer
has handled this age-old Hell’s brew of the
beast and the idealist in man with an insight
that really deserved more beautiful acting.
The other two one-acters were Shaw’s “Over-
ruled,” in which Mrs. Mackie did good work
as Mrs. Juno, and a hair-raiser, “E. and
O. E.”
Singing-teacher Arthur Appleby, who has
been sick, will benefit to the extent of nearly
£5OO from the benefit concert given by the
musicians of Sydney last month.
On December 12 the Wentworth will be
the rendezvous of everybody who is on the
Government House visiting list. On that day
the young of Darling Point will get busy in aid
of the Navy League, and a revue called
“Folly Fare” (Folly Dare, the girl in the
flat opposite persists in calling it) will be
presented by an army of amateurs. Peter
Gawthorne, of the “Outward Bounds,” is
leading the forces
The waterside strike did not stop Sister
Saxby and Nurse Taylor, who were due to
leave Sydney by the Karoola. They are
under engagement to work for the Bush
Church Aid Society, which runs on the same
lines as the Inland Mission and has hospices
almost as far out. These two nurses are
going to the head of the Australian Bight,
in South Aus. Cheated of their boat trip,
they sped across on the new line to
Broken Hill, and so down through S.A. At
the Chapter House there was a gathering
last week to give them a send-off.
And this Letter hopes the good sisters
won’t have to be dug out at the end of the
journey. The line on the far side of Parkes
isn’t ballasted; and the sleeper, trailing at
the tail-end of the train, wears a thick
blanket of dust in the morning. The right
thing to do is to shut all windows and turn
on the fan. Then the dust that won’t stay
■out doesn’t settle and you merely swallow
it. Apart from that, it is a good train,
hut not good enough to make you wish the
25 hours were longer.
Saturday was a typical fete day and Syd-
ney boasted three of note. One was at Fur-
lough House, Narrabeen, the seaside home
for soldiers’ wives and kiddies. At Quambi,
the Kelso King home,'a fair of great dimen-
sions was held to help the funds of Toe 11.
And the girls of Kambala helped themselves
towards the new sports ground they desire
by turning the wide cool verandahs of the
Rose Bay school into an Eastern bazaar.
Her State Ex. officiated at the opening of
this last.
The Union Jack and Australia’s stars
were wedded above the doorway of the Royal
Colonial Institute on a warm still night
last week. From the kerb to the black-aml-
silver lined hall flowed a red carpet, while
upstairs flowed pale-red claret cup, and still
further upstairs flowed waves of music.
“Where’er You Walk” sang Alfred Cunning-
ham ; but lie was the evening’s optimist, for
once within the assembly-rooms it was
impossible to do anything but stand—and
that on one foot. The end-of-tlie-year soiree
apparently lured the entire membership. The
pink of gladioli and the blue of delphinium
murmured in the recesses, school children
carried away silver and bronze medals,
which were handed to them by his Ex. for
essays on the growth of Australian indus-
tries' and on the life of that just man,
Lachlan Macquarie. Black chiffons enfolded
Lady de Chair, who was enlivened by a
curling flame of ostrich fan and a posy of
blue and pink blooms. Mrs. Bavin was in
fuchsia georgette, and filled in the recess
between her shoulder-straps and her ear-
lobes with layers of tulle in the same pinky-
red tones. President George Earp’s wife
clothed herself for her hostess act in bur-
gundy chiffons beaded with diamente. Lady
Cowan flew back with silver fringes, and had
a leashed look as though suffering from an
ingrowing speech; Dame Mary Cook took
her tiara out of mothballs for the occasion;
good-looking Mrs. 11. C. Macfie gave an air
to her silver brocades; Captain Cayley
twinkled over a barricade of decorations, and
the Widgeon Wackett couple absorbed viti-
ated atmosphere and ices on the wing, as it
were. Ethelwyn Kirk, from Maoriland, wore
snowy-white shoulders out of the rounded
neck of a Period frock. Knights Henry
Braddon and Frederick Waley brought their
well-appointed ladies. Mrs. Rosebery, Mrs.
Albert Littlejohn and Mrs. Roystone Davey
and a slip of a girl, Sheila Vale, were
other noticeable people whose just-before-
Christmas smiles were woven into the
friendly corroboree.
If you arrive at the Central from Bourke,
or even Melbourne, and your friends aren't
there to greet you, look for the Travellers’
Aid Society. In the pasc 12 months
3350 trains have been met and 2225 girls
and children helped to find the ivay home.
If you come to town and don’t know the
ropes, ask a porter to direct you to the
Travellers’ Aid rooms. Mrs. Muscio is the
president of this very useful little society,
Mrs. Goodison the treasurer and Miss Mac-
donald the secretary.
This is the arresting profile of Katharine
Susannah Prichard, the Australian woman
writer who makes a hobby of winning first
prizes. She
began doing it
when she was
a small girl in
Tasmania, and
since then
novels and
short stories
and plays of
comp etition-
winning cali-
bre have fallen
from her pen
with monoton-
ous regularity.
One of the best
short stoi'ies
she has ever

Bulletin,
which will be
on sale this
Saturday. I a

Hugo Throssell, V.C. May Moore made the
picture.
(filbert Littlemorc, whose father is a
padre at Strathfield and who is more or less
an invalid, has given the world a pleasant
hook in his "Songs of a Hermit.” The
songs concern children and gardens and the
wholesome things that even a solitary man
with the ear and eye attuned may sense
around him. The writer is a lover of birds
and dogs, and he has much to say that has
both charm and interest. “Songs of a
Hermit” was published in London, but is
now on sale at Angus and Robertson’s.
The Con. orchestra packed its fiddles and
’cellos and grand-pianos away for the end-of-
the-year vacation after its last concert.
Beethoven’s Seventh Symphony was the big
work of the evening, and its joyousness and
gaiety were well brought out by Arundel
Orchard’s music-weavers. The ’cellos got in
some good heavyweight work in Tscliaikow-
sk.y’s “Hamlet,” and the general gloom of Den-
mark’s midnight before the introduction of
the electric torch was well expressed by the
muted horns, while the oboe dealt with
Ophelia’s misery. Poor Ophelia, who might
have been saved by the timely invention of
either the bicycle or the Girl Guide move-
ment ! Lionel Lawson was the violin soloist
in Vaughan Williams’s charm-steeped “The
Lark Ascending.”
When the Divorce Court instals its sculp-
tured group of Paris throwing the apple to
Venus, it will no doubt persuade Justice
Owen to pose as Paris —if his services are
not being claimed for a model of Apollo Bel-
videre. That ’Sonah is an authority on
female beauty is evidenced by his remarks
concerning a little woman who was accused
by her husband the other day of misconduct,
lie dismissed the husband’s petition saying,
“Mrs. is a frail and delicate woman arid
is practically stone deaf.... It is hard to
imagine a less attractive woman”.... The
question is: Was it necessary to drag in the
unfortunate woman’s imperfections? Did
they weigh with ’Sonali? If they did
not they should not have • been mentioned.
If they did —well, then, ’Sonah doesn’t know
men.
Wireless talks on the subject of live wires
and other electrical dangers are a not-to-be-
too-liighly-praised innovation of the St. John
Ambulance Association. On December 13,
at 7.30 p.m., from Station 2BL, Dr. A. R.
McLeod will deliver a lecture on the treat-
ment of electric shock. And there isn’t a
household in which father fiddles about with
the electric-iron that has held up the week’s
laundry that won’t be the better for listen-
ing-in.
When John Norton, of Truth, died he
left a fortune of £106,000. In 11 years it
has grown to £600,000. Only daughter Joan
gets a good whack of this, and during her
minority her accumulations of income have
piled up over £lOO,OOO. Part of these, a mere
£75,000. has been re-invested in the group of
newspapers that John left. His widow, new
Mrs. Norton-iCulhane, has a life-right to
feed in the rich pasturage.

There’s not much margin for saving these days,
and few can look forward to care-free old age.
Even when income grows, needs seem to grow also. The only way to provide
for the future is to make a compulsory saving in an investment. The
humblest wage-earner can invest £5 in a FOREST BOND by paying a
small deposit, and the balance in easy instalments. Every £5 invested in
QUEENSLAND FOREST BONDS ensures a return of £lOO. Ten Bonds,
purchased on a deposit of £2, will mean a saving of £IOOO,

The V.R.C. meeting at Moonee Valley
on Saturday afternoon, being a benefit affair,
was only poorly attended by members, but
the public rolled up in swarms. The day was
windy, with a lot of dust flying about, and
dressing was .of the in-between-seasons order,
ensemble effects and jumper suits being most
favored. Mrs. Lauclilan Mackinnon was in
powder-blue with touches of grey fur, and
her navy crin. hat supported bunches of
cherries. Rejoicing in the success of their
two-year-old Arausio Were the Clive Leonard
couple, she in a fawn costume with a
stitched-silk hat of the same tone. Mrs.
Russell Clarke wore a bois-de-rose jumper
and millinery of harmonising shade.
The bridge which links Swanston-street
and St. Ivilda-road was the jumping-off-
point at the lunch hour one day last week
for diving exhibitions by local and visiting
swimmers, as one of the publicity stunts to
prepare for Learn-to-Swim Week, which
started yesterday. A huge red flag floating
over the centre of the bridge gave many the
impression that Capital was being denounced,
but it was only the ensign of the newspaper
that engineered the sliow, abetted by the
Royal Life Saving Society. A crowd of
about 50,000 occupied the banks on both
sides of the stream. The star turn was
provided by a daring maiden who, tied up in
a sack, allowed herself to be thrown in the
river. A hundred thousand eyes watched
fascinated as the sack sank, and there was
a breathless wait till a shingled head
appeared, and the young lady emerged calm
and smiling in a fetching red bathing suit.
Then there was a life-saving demonstration,
hero of which was a copper-topped boy who
didn’t look more than six years old, but
towed about 16 stone of apparently-drowned
manhood with the greatest ease. Another
item was the immersion of a youth fully
dressed, even to an overcoat, with an open
umbrella. He arose from the depths still
overcoated and still clinging to the brolly.
In Somerset Maugham’s “The Letter,”
presented by. the Vanbrugh-Boucicault co.
on Saturday night at the King’s, Irene
Vanbrugh, as Leslie Crasbie, wears beige
draperies of filmy lace when she shoots her
waning lover in the opening scene. Black
and white voile of cross-over mode with
double flounces and an attractive fawn frock
of similar cut are worn in the trial scenes.
Fleeting glimpses are afforded of Marjorie
Payfair as a Chinese girl, in Oriental garb
of crimson satin, and of Molly Tyrell as
Mrs. Parker, wearing a gown and hat in
two shades of pink. Many handsome wraps
were on view in the r.s. and d.c. In the
front rows were Mayor and Mayoress Morell
and daughter Sheila; American Consul-
General Garrels and his wife; the Elmer
Pauly couple; Mrs. Harold Clapp, wearing
an effective wrap of satin and velvet in pink
tones; Consul-General for France Rene
Turck, Madame Turck and. their daughter
Ninette, whose cape was a charming arrange-
ment of Oriental brocade in mauve and blue
tones; Mrs. T. Tabart, who was with Mrs.
Frank Tait; Mrs. Douglas Stewart and the
John Taits.
Rain did its best to make the Blind In
stitute’s Diamond Jubilee Fair a fiasco, but
Mrs. Jim Angus and her workers are not
easily daunted. There was a hurried trans-
ference of wares from tents and marquees
on the lawn to the supper-room of Ormond
Hall, the store and workshops of the Insti-
tute and any other spare corners that could
be found. Friends of the blind, and they
are many, rolled up in force with money in
their pockets, and business was brisk. On
the second day the sun shone, and the original
programme of an al fresco bazaar was re-
sumed. Superintendent S. W. Hedger’s wife
commanded the flower stall and Matron
Briggs ruled over the refreshment tent. The
aim of the fair was to garner £2OOO to
build a hostel for blind boys and young men,
and probably the total will not be far short
of that goal. Special attractions of the
fair were the music provided by the orchestra
of blind musicians and the folk-dancing of
sightless children.
The Horace Wimpole couple held a dance
for the younger set at No. 9 the other even-
ing, so that their daughter • Nell might wel-
come Jiomc from oversea the Herbert Symes’
daughters Maisie and Barbara, their brothers
Hugh arid David, the Clive Kings’ Peggy,
and lan Macdougall. The hostess, wearing
beaded raiment of black, gave greeting to
scores of bright lasses and lads. Nell Wim-
pole’s frock was of pale amber hue, shirred of
bodice, with line ruchings of blue ribbon, and
a full skirt; Peggy King’s silver lame cover-
ing had bodice decoration of motlier-o’-
pearl tinted blossoms and Maisie Syma’s
frock was of geranium-pink georgette. Shiela
Morell wore a filmy confection of royal blue
and Mavis Carnegie had a gleam of pink
beneath black lace and chiffon. Nancy Syme
looked handsome in gold : and-silver brocaded
lame.
State Governor Somers. during the week
put into position the commemoration stone
of the additions to the Children’s Hospital, a
building for out-patients which is well on its
way towards completion. Lady Somers, hold-
ing a presentation posy of pink carnations,
watched her husband’s dexterity with the
trowel. Mrs. Lauchlan Mackinnon, presi-
dent of the institution, did the honors ; and
the treasurer, Miss M. M. Guthrie, ex-
plained that a donation from the Edward
Wilson trust purchased the land upon which
the tliree-storeycd building is rising, and that
other gifts had helped to pay the builders.
Dr. Douglas Stephens, Judge Mann and
others were speakers. James Elder and his
lady, the Lockycr lady, Mrs. Percy Oakden,
the hospital’s lion, sec., and Mayoress Apps,
of Fitzroy, were among the many friends of
the institution who attended.
As hostess of the Austral Salon’s weekly
tea-party, Mrs. li. Wild, known on the
concert stage as Jessie Batchelor, welcomed
Mrs. J. L. Stein, who has been abroad. The
returned member, who is a most energetic
worker in the Salon’s interests, wore black
georgette with trimmings of fur and crystal-
bead embroidery, with a black hat. Mrs.
Wild, who was in delphinium blue traced
with a gilded pattern and a hat of black
crinoline straw, sang some of the songs of
Edith tlarrhy, who played the accompani-
ments. Marion Lightfoot plunked the strings
of her banjo, and Alba Zacutti was heard.in
recitations.
The ministering angels of the Eye and
Ear Hospital rejoiced last week, for their
new home in Brunswick-street, Fitzroy, just
over the way from the hospital, was opened
officially by Mayoress Morell. There was a
fete in the grounds to help pay for the
new quarters. The 30 branches linked with
the Hospital Central Auxiliary gave assist-
ance in furnishing this fine old house, which
once upon a time was the home of Sam Gil-
lott and his lady. The Blind Institute
orchestra played.
An American tea engineered by the presi-
dent and committee of the Yooralla Hospital
School and Free Kindergarten was given on
Saturday afternoon at Grange Hill, East
Kew, the home of vice-president Mrs. Arthur
Hurlstone. The principle of “Bring a gift
and buy a gift” was in force, and there was
a good harvest -of shekels.
The L.T.A.V. dance at Kooyong Club
House on Saturday night drew such a crowd
that dancing was difficult, but the jollo
made a pleasant ending to the day’s sport.
Daphne Akhurst and Marjorie Cox of
N.S.W. and some other inter-State players
Were guests. Yera de Bavay, who wore white
raiment with embroidery of reseda-green, was
again responsible for the adornment of the
rooms, which were gay with hollyhocks, del-
phiniums and pink carnations.
This is Victor Stephenson, the 21-year-old
Bananalander who startled Melbourne
critics into superlatives by his playing at
his first professional pianoforte recital at
the Assembly
Hall recently.
The youth’s
father was
killed wh e n
serving with
the 19th Bat-
talion, and his
son was ap-
prenticed to a
trade, but
Brisbane
musicians
brought his
musical
talents first
discovered by
Sydney May,
o f Ipswich
Grammar
School —to the
notice of Re-
p a t., which
paid his board
for three
years in Melbourne. He earned his tuition
at the Uni. Con. by winning an exhibition
scholarship. Now he wants to go to
Europe, and many admirers of his playing
agree with his teacher, F. W. Homewood,
that he ought to be given the chance to
climb to the top of the ladder up which he
has already toiled* so far and so pluckily.
Beatrice Henty, youngest daughter of. the
late Henry Henty couple of Tarring, Ivew,
and a descendant of the pioneer Hentys,
pledged herself to love, honor and obey
Graham Blandy at St. .John’s, Toorak, one
afternoon last week. The bride was hon.
organiser of the Vic. branch of the Austra-
lian Comforts Fund during the Big Scrap,
winning a C.B.E. for her work, and her just
acquired husband was an ardent Red Cross
worker during the same period. A frock of
beige pink and fawn georgette with margot
lace, allied to a matching hat with clipped
feather mount, and a posy of pink carna-
tions and delphiniums formed the bride’s
array. White lilies and delicate pink blooms
decorated the church.
Harry Fern, pictured here by Lafayette,
is one of our
most promis-
ing young
water-colorists.
He learned to
wield pencil
and brush at
the Ballarat
Ar t School,
under princi-
pa 1 H. H.
Smith, and
• later worked
with artist
McNally. He
earns his
bread and
butter in the
office of an
a n e tioneering
fi r ,m, b u t
spends his
wee k-e nds
t r a n s cribing
this State’s
scenic beauties. His ambition is to study
abroad and to devote himself entirely to
an art career.
Mrs. Bland.y (Beatrice Henty that was)
got a pleasant surprise amongst her wed-
ding gifts. Forty members of the Town Hall
Comforts Fund clubbed together and bought
three antique silver dishes as a tribute to
Miss Henty’s good work for the cause.
There was much marrying and giving-in-
marriage last week. A fashionable and pic-
turesque union at Grammar School Chapel
was that of Jennie, daughter of the late
Franklin Graham and of Mrs. Graham, of
Belubla, Caulfield, with Norman, eldest son
of the E. J. Mitchell couple, of Camberwell.
The bride’s robe, straight .of line, which just
cleared the ground, was of white satin pat-
terned in gold, with a train of gilded lame.
The veil was of white tulle, and the bride
carried a sheaf of water-lilies. Two maids
in pink and gold and a small trainbearer,
also roseate clad, completed a pretty picture.
Guests were received at Chastleton after-
wards.
John Tait stage-managed a double wed-
ding at St. John’s, Toorak, on Thursday
night, and took a role himself —that of
proud father of a pair of pretty brides.
Second daughter Lilian Clarice, generally
known as Clare, who married Harold Fred-
erick James, a young Englishman, wore
Brussels lace with a glow of pink beneath.
Her . three attendant ’maids were in deep
pink, with rose-wreathed brows. Third daugh-
ter Janet Evelyn, whose choice was Charles
Neville Hollingshed, eldest son of the C. F.
Hollingsheds, of Brisbane, was in simple
georgette raiment, all white, with a sparkle
of crystal and floatings of Limerick lace and
tulle. Her trio of maids took the aisle in
gowns of leaf-green over pale pink. Both
brides had trainbearers in Kate Greenaway
frocks of white satin. Clad in gold lace
and satin Mrs. John Tait came into the pic-
ture later as hostess at Fairliaven, Kooyong-
road, Caulfield, which was a bower of pink
blossoms and rambler roses.
Dorothy Penfold, daughter of Dr. Oliver
Penfold, of Bendigo, put in a few days here
last week on her way to join the Marella in
Sydney to spend a couple of months with
her brother Lashmar at Ipoh, Malay States.
The young man, who began an engineering
course at Trinity College, graduated at-
Cambridge. During the Big Scrap he
served with the, Boyal Engineers and now
is general manager and chief engineer of
the Perak River Hydro-electric Co., an
enterprise in which the English and Swedish
Governments are interested. Dorothy Pen-
fold, whose lyric soprano voice got its final
polish at the R.C.M., London, trains the
promising warblers of Bendigo. Every now
and then her father, who is an accomplished
musician, indulges in composition. His last
efforts, a song, “O Love Divine,” and a
Bridal March, are highly spoken of.
The Australian Literature Society, at a
social gathering at the Ambassadors re-
cently, made a fuss of Katharine Susannah
Prichard and her V.C. husband, Captain
Throssell, who have been holidaying in other
parts of the Commonwealth. The authoress’s
works were highly praised by the president
of the society (Dr. J. Booth), E. J. Brady
and others. Walter J. Henderson, of
Albury, was another literary visitor who was
brought into the limelight. Readings of
Mary Fullarton’s poems by Miss Malmgren,
and of Shaw Neilson’s verses by Jessie
AVilson, were interludes.
Back in Melbourne after a three years’
residence in the Big Smoke is Phillis Lock-
hart, who made a name in these parts as
teacher of music by the aural plan. Many
public and private schools have adopted her
methods. In London she has been devoting
her time to study and has done no teaching.
She expects to return to England in Feb-
ruary.
The best-looking member of the Labor
Ministry, Harry Bailey, had the floor for a
fair time last week with his bill to create
harbor boards for Portland, Warrnambool
(his own city), Port Fairy, Walsh pool and
Lakes’ Entrance. He is generally tailored in
a way that harmonises with his natural
endowments. Though he has a s(«i who is on
the verge of taking his medical degrees, he
still looks aggressively youthful. He is a
widower, and, without particular reference
to that fact, it may be remarked that it is
quite a while —seven years—since a member
of a Victorian Cabinet was married while
holding office.
The Carroll management has engaged a
young Victorian, Myrl Roberts, to play an
important part in “The Ghost Train,” which
opened at Albury on Saturday. • Miss
Roberts, who is a niece of the Countess of
Darnley, has had a turn at musical comedy,
and at drama with Leon Gordon, but her
new part is a big step upwards.
The Harold Ashtons, Who have led a home-
less life since the sale of Wimmera Park,
have acquired Kileneen, the Webb Ware
place in the Corowa district, and will settle
in when they have tired of the golf links
at Barwon Heads. Corowa, though rather
sultry, is quite a gay spot when it wakes
up once a year for the piciiic race meeting
and ball, large house parties from the city
being gathered for the occasion.
A sentimental feeling is responsible for
the John Sladen Wing couple’s presence in
our midst. They desired to see Sladen Hall,
Geelong, founded by their ancestor, who
stepped off a ship in 1842 and settled down
to practise law. He became Geelong’s first
member in the Vic. Parliament and was
treasurer in the Haines Government. J. S.
Wing, who is a member of a London law
firm, is a nephew of the late statesman.
The party includes Edward Sargant, a Lord
Justice of Appeal.
The approaching visit, of Sir Robert
Horne is causing a flutter in financial as
well as social circles, for he has influence
over millions of British capital. Turning
up a lucrative law practice for a political
career, he made meteoric progress, becoming
Chancellor of the Exchequer after two years
of private membership.
Fired by the success of the film based
on her father’s great novel, Marion
Marcus Clarke is busy with a dramatic ver-
sion of “For the Term of His Natural Life.”
A play adapted from the book was staged in
Australia some years back, but Miss Clarke
considers that neither play nor film does full
justice to the original. She intends to take
the finished script to America with a view to
securing production on the most lavish scale.
Capt. Cunningham Reid, Conservative
M.P. for Warrington, in the Old Dart, has
come this way with his millionairess bride to
visit Lord Stonehaven, to whom he was Par-
liamentary secretary when, as Sir John
Baird, the now G.-G. was First Commis-
sioner of Works. Mrs. Reid, who is a
daughter of Colonel Ashley, like her sister
who married Lord Louis Mountbatten,
Edward P.’s cousin, inherited £2,000,000
from Sir Ernest Cassel, the banker. The
State Governor and Lady Somers gave the
Reids bed and board on their arrival last
week by the Sydney express.
The City Mission is sending out an SOS
for Christmas cheer for the numerous poor
to whom it extends a helping hand. For
the trees alone 2500 gifts are required.
Readers of this page who are young enough
to remember what Christmas means to the
kiddies should note the Mission’s address—■
280-82 Exhibition-street.
From America come good reports of the
progress of Constance Neville Johns, whose
coloratura soprano voice was trained at the
Uni. Con. She got her first chance on the
Chautauqua circuit; and after further experi-
ence in the not-quite-dry republic went to
Rome for further study. Returning to the
U.S. she secured many concert engagements.
A musical event of last week was the
Lyric Choral Society’s concert. Muriel
Cheek conducted a choir of 60, and got some
impressive effects. Beethoven’s Hallelujah
Chorus, from the “Mount of Olives,” and
Dudley Buck’s “Hymn to Music,” figured in
the choral programme. Pianist Emilie
Davies, tenor Ernest Hocking and soprano
Kate Hocking were soloists, and Charles
Breen recited.
“A.G.M.’s” note from London :
A Maorilander, Marie Ney, will play lead in the
Shakspeare company financed by the Egyptian Gov-
ernment to run a three weeks’ season in Cairo. The
director is Bob Atkins of “Old Vic.” fame, and
several members of the “Old Vic.” company will
take their former parts. King Fuad is one of the
patrons.

Forget-me-nots and Dorothy Perkins roses
met Lady Goodwin when she went with his
Ex. to Stuartholme Convent. Father
Murphy and Father Hogan greeted them,
Judge and Mrs. Macrossan and Mayor and
Mrs. Jolly standing by. The pupils sang
the Anthem, and Sir John said he admired
the situation of the convent school. After-
noon tea followed.
In the Albert Hal] the Goodwins attended
the Church of England Grammar’s celebra-
tion. Prizes were handed out by the Gov-
ernor in the presence of ,'Gaiters Sharp, Dean
and Mrs. de Witt Batty, the Herrings,
Mants and others.
Sir John and Lady Goodwin were guests
at the Rotary Club lunch given at Lennon’s
in a setting of red and pink roses. Navy and
gold ribbons looped the v.-r. table, and the
Union Jack, Australian ensign and Rotary
banners and mottoes were part of the decora-
tions. Mabel Malouf and Mildred Bell were
songsters.
In the morning their Exes, went to All
Hallows’, on their first official visit. The
new superior, Mother Alban, received the
guests, and Father Barry gave Lady Good-
win a bouquet of arum-lilies and delphiniums
and a Limerick-lace handkerchief in an ivory
moire’ case broidered in gold and forget-me-
nots. A sister worked the lace handker-
chief, and the sachet was made at St. Ann’s.
Bowls of shasta-daisies flanked the teapot,
and blue and white blossoms decked the
reading-room.
Clever Jean Trundle had a very success-
ful elocutionary and dramatic evening in
All Saints’ Flail, which, despite wild
wind and rain, was well filled. With 12
inches of rain at Springbrooke and a hurri-
cane in the wheat districts, we have begun
the rainy season a little early this year,
but the whole country around is green.
When Barbara Sisley staged Maeter-
linck’s “Blue Bird” the stage was stacked
with flowers and other gifts, and all society
was there in its smartest frocking. The
Goodwins, attended by Colonel Campbell,
Major Wolff, Mrs. J. J. Stable and Miss
Bedford, saw the first night’s performance.
The Crfeche and Kindergarten raked in £2OO.
Yankee film-producers’ notions concerning
the terrors of life in the Australian back-
hlocks got some corroboration on the Gayn-
dah-road, Maryborough, when a little girl
named Gladys Bird was knocked from her
bicycle by a whip-tail kangaroo and con-
siderably mauled. She caught its forepaws,
and it then began to kick. A man cycling
along the road heard her screams, and came
to the rescue. The kangaroo was sentenced
to death and shot.
Mayoress Jolly presented the trophies won
by South Brisbane Croquet Club members
at an afternoon gathering on the lawns at
Musgrave Park, A bouquet of shasta-daisies
tied with roval blue was handed to her by
little Shirley McGowan. Tea was sipped
on the pavilion lawn amidst daisies and
gaillardias.
At the Lyceum Club’s party in the Hall
of the Muses, a municipal and dramatic pro-
gramme arranged by Mrs. Spencer Browne
and Miss Lyons included some of Mrs.
Spencer Browne’s musical compositions.

Perth.
All sorts of entertainments are being
arranged for Madame Marie Lambert, the
Belgian singer who is here under engage-
ment with the Union Theatres, and for
Betty Ross Clarke and her company. The
Green Room and Repertory Clubs have each
had them as guests, and Madame Lambert
sang on each occasion. Mrs. Theodore
Ambrose had a party at the Savoy to wel-
come Miss Clarke (Helen Ambrose is anxious
to face the footlights) ; and the Brennan
girls had a flapper party at their home for
Miss Clarke and Warde Morgan. The women
scribblers entertained Madame Lambert and
Miss Clarke at luncheon at the Karrakatta
Club. More invitations to river parties and
other outings have been received than can
possibly be accepted.
This is Mrs. C. FI. Manning who, with
her colonel, left for Fogtown by the Mooltan.
Her husband has been appointed Director of
Migration in
London, and
Mrs. Manning,
who for years
has taken a
great interest
in the welfare
o f migrants
arriving in
Australia, will
be able to
give him prac-
tic a 1 assist-
ance. She was
president of
the National
Council of
Women for
two years;
has been presi-
dent of the
Women’s
Immigration
Au xil iary
Council since
it s inception
and president of the Friendly Union of
Soldiers’ Wives for many years. She is a
Justice of the Peace and in addition to the
organisations mentioned has associated her-
self with many other social welfare move-
ments.
The Hackett-Moulden lady was immersed
in business while here, but found time to
gather a few tried and trusty friends round
her for lunch at the Savoy. Her sister,
Mi’s. Ferguson Stewart, of Guildford, gave
a party for the visitor in the evening.
Thelma, eldest daughter of the /Cairns
1 Hills, of West Perth, has made a date with
lan, youngest son of the late A. W. Edgar
and Mrs. Edgar, of Strathalbyn, Gingin.
Rod, the only son of our former Premier
and Agent-General Newton Moore and his
lady, married Olive, younger daughter of
Thomas Bilbo Robinson and his lady, for-
merly of Bananaland, at the Guards’ Chapel,
Wellington Barracks, London, a few weeks
ago. The bride wore white velvet. Among
the Australian guests were Agent-General
Angwin and his daughter and some of the
Connolly folk.
Marjorie, second daughter of the Jock
Morrison couple, is wearing an engagement
ring, the gift of Dr. Fred Vincent, one of
our youngest medicos.

Hobart.
The Naval and Military Club’s dance was
a very gay affair. The jazzei’s stepped round
the floor of the Masonic Hall, which was
decorated with flags, and the club rooms
in the Treasury chambers, just across the
way, were given over to those who preferred
cards. Commander and Mrs. McFarlane re-
presented the senior service and received the
guests, aided by Col. and Mrs. R. S. Smith,
representing the Army. The supper-tables
were decorated with Iceland poppies arranged
in tulle of harmonising colors. Mrs. Cox
Taylor’s gown of cyclamen lace was effective.
Mrs. McFarlane wore green, with beads, and
Mrs. R. P. Smith black with royal-blue and
sequins.
The O’Grady opened the new baby clinic
building at Moonah in the presence of a big
crowd of interested womenfolk. Mrs. Arthur
Walch welcomed the Governor. The site, she
said, had been paid for, but the Child Wel-
fare Association was in debt for the building.
The Lyceum Club had no difficulty in
mobilising a record rally of members and
friends to welcome Mrs. Dobson, and the
rooms were filled with folk anxious to greet
the returned president. Mrs. Dobson enter-
tained them with her impressions of the
Geneva Conference, and recounted other ex-
periences. Then tea was brewed and there
was music and chatter.
The Tassie Too, the new 21-footer which
has been built by the Tas. R.Y.C. to compete
in the Forster and Albert Cup races in Sydney
next month, was launched at Lucas’s slip,
Battery Point, a big crowd looking on. The
commodore’s daughter, Jean Tinning, broke
a bottle of bubbly over her bow and cut the
ribbons which held her. If the little craft
upholds the reputation of the first Tassie we
islanders will be more than satisfied.
The smiling face pictured here by Bernard
Watt belongs to Mrs. Ruby McLaren, of
Hobart. Organisation is her forte, and
any commit-
tee that owns
her as a mem-
ber has a com-
fortable feel-
ing that tri-
umph is as-
sured, no mat-
ter what may
be aimed at.
The Free Kin-
dergarten car-
nival which
raked in such
a lot of money
last winter
was one of
many success-
ful affairs of
the kind in
which she has
taken a lead-
ing part. But
her pliil a n-
thropic duties
are not allowed to crowd out social ones.
Mrs. McLaren lias a delightful home, and is
fond of entertaining her friends in it.
Ethel Nicholls, who has been secretary to
the Art Society of Tasmania for many years,
as well as being one of the society’s chief
supports as an exhibitor, has resigned. She
has been elected a life-member.

The Governor is still running the gauntlet
of good-byes and presentations. Of the pre-
sents, probably the one that he most prizes
is the address and membership badge from
the Limbless Soldiers’ Association. He has
been a staunch friend to the R.S.A. ever
since he came, and especially to those of its
members who have suffered like himself. He
goes to the Eastern States, and perhaps to
Maoriland, before going back to Blighty.
The end of the month saw the opening
of the Floating Palais, all newly floored
and re-decorated; the end of official tennis
and croquet, and, incidentally, hail and as
cold a day as we’ve had for ages. At the
Oval, where tennis and croquet went into
temporary recess, Miss Murray presented
tournament prizes, including championisip
rewards for May Hill and Mrs. L. W. Hack
and a handicap priz.e for the former as well.
The scholarship offered by the London
School of Dalcroze Eurhythmies to Austra-
lian students goes to Margaret Scales of
this village, with Helen Wimble, also a
South Australian, as runner up. And the
Elder scholarship, for piano, goes to our
] 4-year-old Betty Puddy. We are the city
of culture.
The Gallery has a new James Ashton pic-
ture: a sunset study of the South Coast,
bought and presented by a committee of
which O. L. Isaacson was chairman, and
accepted, on behalf of the Gallery, by Prof.
Archibald Strong at a tea-drinking at Covent
Garden.
Femininity has blazed its way to a new
industry, with rather expensive consequences
for one of the pioneers. The daughter of
an up-country hotelkeeper, aged 17, has
been fined £5 with costs by a couhtry
Children’s Court for laying the odds. She
is not the first of her sex to be charged with
bookmaking, but she’s the first to be made
an awful example.
Returned voyagers include the Roy Milnes,
Dr. and Mrs. A. E. V. Richardson and their
daughter, Mrs. S. H. Skipper and Mrs. Nott, '
the two latter after a six weeks’ trip to
Colombo. >

G.D.M. (Waverley) : Rule 1 for Bulletin
writers: Get something to say. Rule 2: Say it in
the fewest possible syllables. .. .Belvider: Hopeless.
M.C.M.: Some vivid work in it; but the tale
fades 0ut.... Florence H.: Ingenious but du11....
Nellie R.: Poor stuff W.T.M.: Rhymed descrip-
tion of your residence doesn’t appeal. We’re not
in the real-estate line. . . .M.M.: A couple of rhymes
may do T.G.W.: No; but he had a good run for
your money.... Skeeta: You need more sting....
Leonida: “Unachievement” fails... .H.D.W.; “Cow”
nearly horned in. .. .Mavis K. P.: Very great improve-
ment. Sent on, as requested V.R.M.: The
-‘poatry” isn’t J.A.K.: The writer who rhymes
“matter”-“water” may go far, but not in these
columns.... Gabrielle: You don’t seem to have the
remotest idea of scansion... .E.S.: Immature....
Kallapar: Don't fling in any sort of line to make up
weight.... Bellerive: Room for your ocean tragedy :
O’er the crests of the waters
It did steadily sail,
When a southern breeze
Freshened into angry gale.
Against the starboard
Fierce heavy seas dashed;
O’er the laboring crew
The frothy sprays splashed.
The Captain perceived
’Twould be of no avail
To launch the boats
Against the driving gale.
Down went the smack
’Neath the depths of the tide
1 Where carrion monsters
Lurketh and glide.
....Lam G.: “His name, Kingston,” doesn’t “show
that he was of regal ancestry” any more than Pat
Malone’s first name indicates that he is a patrician.
... .8.M.: If meant seriously, it’s funny; if
meant humorously, it’s sad. .. .Geo. G. S.: W here
did you get your “pure as the riven snow” i....
E.T.W.: The Religious Editor, who inspects ’em for
us, says that what you describe isn’t at all like
the interior of any “den of iniquity” he knows.
....Americano: You flatter it:—
Adorable! Magnificent! Thou are superb, Harbor!
By thy sweet dells than anywhere I’d live rather —
Eden of bountiful beauteousness ! Land of sun !
Here shall I stay with thee, till Death doth come !
... .Bern D.: You must read more than two or three
Australian books before you write articles about
Australian literature. Tiie Bulletin is here to
foster Australian literature, not to Foster Fraser it.
....Colin L. L.: “Dashed off,” was' it? Well, we
don’t want any dashed thing. .. .P.J.S.: “My woe is
never-ending.” Our “whoa” is final... .G.M.C.: Tin-
old ship sank in the w.p.b H.V.T.W.: Too far-
fetched. .. .W.R.L.: “Loss” lost C.R.D.: One good
verse; the others are commonplace... .Whip: Away
with those puns! S.P.C.: Lost in the bush....
Brady’s Lookout: The squabble goes no further
Ron C.: P00r... .1.G.: Can’t tootle here... .Horatio
E. : Verse about Drake bowled out for a duck....
. ...R.G.: The rose faded E. J.C.: The doggerel
barks at too great a length.... Bingy: Promised
well, but was drowned in a foam of words... .F.N.J.:
Has color, but wanders.... Boomah: Two four-lined
stanzas, and a long chorus to each, don’t suit our
style Coorem K.: “Bush-fire” is put 0ut....
Maryann: “Jessie” would be a white elephant to
us Anon: The Chinaman’s vengeance is a
muddled affair.... Danvers W.: Does not ring true.
Alex. A.: A lot of words for a dreary jest....
F. : Teeth business is funny—as far as it goes.
It left us in the air. .. .E.R.M.: One of the oldest
jokes on earth is no less ancient for being versified.
J.B. (Richmond, Vic.): The “butterflies
gambolled.” We’d like to see that. .. .Madeline B.:
More thought needed. .. .Evelyn M.: Those loads in
the last line break the back of its chances... .Z.V.W.:
No useless coffin encases them....B. Jaw: “For
want of a better name, I call the sketch ‘James.’ ”
Home, James!... .F.J.D.: Merely a frilled common-
place. . . .W.W.S.: “Morning Light” fades out. .. .
W.J.T.: Not much in it.... A.E.S,: (Renmark) : Poor
stuff.. . .T.C.D.: Watch story doesn’t go-well enough.
H.M.W.: Not quite... .Lorna O’B.: Can’t see it.
W.T.-W.: All ineffective... .Irene C.: Until the
competition stories appear there will be no serials
in The Bulletin M.R.: Description of Mount
Egmont reminds us, somehow, of ice-cream: —
Glorious mount, from far or near—
Symmetrical, alone —-
Clear-cut its towering lines appear,
Majestic Cone!
... .T.V.T.: Good; but it might have been better as
“The Old Delicensed Poet”. . . .G.A.L.: Oh, “Soli-
tude,” where are thy charms?... .C.C. (Auckland):
Sorry, but it’s a cross between a story and an
article. Idea good. .. .A. 8.: Merely a description of
a long agony 8.F.W.: “His kisses throws!”
There are other errors of the kind. . . .D.McK.: No,
it’s fair ; but it gives no new angle to a much-used
situation Ivy G.: “Along the Road” nearly
annexed a cash prize..... Merv 0.: A lot of it is
just daily-paper sensationalism put into rhyme....
Jim D.:. Not enough in it. . . .Roger P. C.: They are
too obviously written. You’ve got to produce some-
thing to make people forget the gramophone and
remember the music G.D.M.: Did that last verse
get mixed up in a collision?... .Ethel S.: It is
obvious at the start that wifey had posted the letter.
... .G.A.A.: Pig yarn hasn’t fat enough for more
than a par Loil: Too much introduction....
Glam S.: Doesn’t appeal 0.T.: No; but the line
“Heavy and slumbrous (counting sheep numbrous)”
is a gem in its own way.... Jack M.: Perhaps you
know what the ending means; nobody else would.
Merle L.: Story also fell —into w.p.b P.K.P.:
Too long-drawn-out N.S.M. : Not much in it
N.G.: Y’ou haven’t yet learned the way to tell a
story F.A.0.: Idea not worth print; but you
seem to have verse-sense... .M.C.M.: Of course, it

THE INKY WAY.
‘‘Pot Jostler, Junior”: I sold a cheque
received from The Bulletin this year to
an out-back W.A. squatter at a premium. It
was under 30s. but I got £2 for it as an
art curio. Don't know whether it has been
presented yet, but the value set on it makes
me feel more grateful than ever to the late
Livingston Hopkins.
“Coot”: Clapp’s Railway Magazine wall
probably be discontinued shortly. The loss
on publication last year was £BOOO, and
this year’s deficit is expected to be about
£6OOO. It was suggested that the 29,000
employees should be charged 3d. a copy in
future (it is sold to the public for 6d.), but
the department is doubtful whether they
would relish paying even that humble coin
after having received the magazine gratis
so long.
“Lao-dah”: Condensation has its dangers.
An Argus sub. was faced with the necessity
of reducing a speech at the Law Institute
by president C. H. Lucas to a size commen-
surate with its news importance. A portion
of it ran: “I only wish to deal with one
aspect of legislation as we know it in Vic-
toria, and that I characterise, with all due
respect to our colleague the Attorney-Gen-
eral and his friends at the top of Bourke-
street, Melbourne, as a rusty hinge in the
Parliamentary machine.” What he made of
it was: “Mr. Lucas characterised the Attor-
ney-General (Mr. Slater) and his colleagues
as ‘rusty hinges’ in the Parliamentary
machine.”
“Knib”: Incidentally, if not mainly, the
Celtic attack on “The Callahans and Mur-
phys” film was a newspaper stunt. A Melb.
religious weekly, the Tribune, started the
ball rolling and kept it going till the picture
was withdrawn. The public meeting and
the deputation to Chief-Sec. Prendergast
were more or less prompted by the paper.
While Prendy did not and could not ban
the picture, he exercised some pressure, and
the threatened ruction at Brunswick was
averted. It wasn’t much of a film, anyhow.
“Skyrider” : But there are some who never
got into The Bulletin at all. I knew one;
his name was Waggles, and he always
enclosed with his pars, a letter explaining
the joke—which, after all, argued a certain
thoughtfulness. The comment on bis one
and only poem settled him; it was “8.P.W.:
W.P.8.” He’s a station-owner now.
“Kriz”: All the early-day magazines
weren’t in Melbourne or Sydney (B.
17/11/’27). Back in 1861 one William
Robson founded the West Australian
Literary Magazine in Berth. Four num-
bers appeared, at which stage the editor was
run in, and the publication ceased. Robson
was an ex-convict wdio had been employed in
the Commissariat Department and through
good conduct had soon gained his ticket of
leave. His short-lived magazine contained
poems by Byron and Gray, which he sought
to pass off as his own compositions on the
unsophisticated Gropers of that era.
“P.X.”: No doubt The Bulletin is asked
50 times a year why it doesn’t print a boys
paper. Such a good case can be made out
for one-—the youngsters read papers which
are printed outside Australia and which do
no good when they don’t do harm. But
in these days of very high costs something
else besides circulation must be got. There
must be advertising. I don’t know, but I
calculate that every copy of The Bulletin
costs a shilling or thereabouts —the other
sixpence the advertiser has to pay. Mel-
bourne Herald can make a success out of
most “possible” publications; but it lately
found that the boys’ paper can’t command
the advertising that is necessary to make up
the difference between cost of production and
sale price. And, honestly, would you expect
it to?
“Coot”: Harold Mercer (R.P. l/12/'27)
expressed a desire that some of the light
“Oriel” verse of “Peter ’ Symmons should
be redeemed from oblivion. A selection was
published in a small memorial volume in
1903, entitled “Satires and Verses.” This
included some delightful rhymes concerning
’Ancock, M.L.A.; Mr. Harry Musgrove's
Moral Cricket Team; and topical verse re-
garding Tommy Bent and other politicians.
Donald MacDonald prefaced the volume with
an interesting sketch of Symmons’s person-
ality and writings, and John Sandes wrote
an In Memoriam poem.
“Harald Bluetooth”: In Denmark the
Minister of Finance is empowered to place
any poet whose work he considers sufficiently
deserving on the Civil list, with a regular
Government salary. It was recently an-
nounced that one rising young poet had been
singled out for this distinction, though he
has not yet published a book. His only
claim to the bays and the brass is that he has
published verses in the newspapers. In case
there should be a desire on the part of Aus-
tralian poets to invade this literary Eldorado.
I hasten to add that to be eligible the bard
must be Danish born, and dwell in Denman;
-—a highly sober country wherein no one is
allowed to have two drinks running in the
same establishment.
“Murkah”: Newspaper squabbles are
tame affairs compared with what they were
in the old days. Thus Die Cornwall
Chronicle (Launceston), November, lS3h:
“We learn that another newspaper is about
being started in Launceston, under the pat-
ronage and behind-the-eurtain assistance. ot
the proprietor of a defunct humbug print.
The character of the Colonial press must
indeed be low when it becomes the property
of a petty greengrocer, and the parties
engaged in it are reduced to taking in pay-
ment for their services sugar mixed with 50
per cent. sand, tea adulterated with leaves
of the damson-tree, tobacco saturated with
dye, and the balance in penny tracts charged
twopence.” The editor (elect) referred to
was John Pascoe Fawlmer, who was also
proprietor of a hotel and a provision store.
No. 1 of the Launceston Advertiser con-
tained a competent reply, winding up with
an invitation to the Chronicle's editor r«
“come and settle the wine-bill you ran up at
my place some three months ago.”

EPILOGUE.
The night has fallen, the day’s quite dead,
Only the chichaks bark o’erhead,
Only the bats flit to and fro
In and out of the bungalow;
And keeping time to their ghostly flitting
You notice a woman’s fingers knitting.
List to a tale of a soul in need.
Where the Ten Commandments run
to seed.
No babes to knit for and altogether
Knitting’s a bore in this tropical weather.
Hubby’s old, though he can’t help that,
But if only he wasn’t so beastly fat!
The night’s as hot as a festering sore
And hubby has gone to Singapore.
List to the tale of a holy mess
Cooked by Fate in the F.M.S.
The rubber-trees stand row on row
Like warders round the bungalow,
But the wind’s as free as the nightjar’s
winging
And up from the coolie lines comes singing
A song of infinite gradation—
There’s a nice young man on the next plan-
tation !
List to the tale of a Tropical Hell —
But it might have been Toorak just
as well!
* * * *
“The Letter” of Somerset Maugham,
staged by Boucicault at the King’s on Satur-
day, needed some sort of introduction any-
how, since it opens with Irene Vanbrugh
tearing across a bungalow verandah and
emptying her husband’s revolver into the body
of the hastily-departing Ronald Ward. She
explains that she did it to defend herself from
his obvious intentions. Her legal advisor
plainly disbelieves her, but the white com-
munity of Singapore is enthusiastically on
her side, especially when it appears that the
dead man has been living with a Chinese
woman. The trial is a farce, the jury having
made up its mind beforehand, and Miss Van-
brugh is discharged without a stain upon her
character. It appears, however, that there is
a letter. It was written by the lady to the
dead man on the night of the tragedy pas-
sionately imploring him to come across. Her
lawyer buys the letter and suppresses it,
entering the out-of-pocket expenses on this
count in his bill. The size of the item —
10,000 dollars—opens the husband’s eyes and
Miss Vanbrugh is obliged to explain that she
has been for years the dead man’s lover and
that she killed him out of jealousy when she
heard of his new paramour. The curtain
descends on her assertion that her retribution
will be to pretend to love her broken husband
while still adoring the murdered man.
* * * *
If any of the audience imagined that this
entertaining melodrama would continue at
the same furious tempo as it began, with per-
haps more shootings, and maybe a railway
accident or two, they were doomed to dis-
appointment. The meticulous Dion made his
orchestra of Chinese boys, Malay servants,
etc., fiddle dead slow for the rest of the
evening, so that a play which would take
the average person half an hour to read kept
the house warming the upholstery till 11.
One or two of the exits were almost comic in
their gradualness, and even the curtain-
manipulator caught the go-slow epidemic
and lowered his plush drape with such de-
liberation after one act that the legs of the
performers lingered before the eye long after
the heads had vanished from the memory and
sporting members of the audience had time 1
to indulge in a guessing competition as to
the ownership of the various extremities. It
would be unfair to Boucicault to deny, how-
ever, that the snail-like pace of the produc-
tion made for effectiveness on the whole.
Norman McKinnel is a master of slow-motion
acting, and the way he stretched Miss Van-
brugh on the rack of his implacable cross-
questioning was artistic, as well as a source
of delight to the masochistically inclined.
Miss Vanbrugh’s mental agony occupied the
stage for acts and was almost more than
one actress should be asked to bear. The
only relief to it wiA an interlude in which
some Gilbert and Sullivan Chinamen dis-
puted over the price to be paid for the letter.
They were a glaring contrast to the real
Chinese “boys” of the first act. The most
vivid scene was a flash-back depicting the
missing stages of the murder. Gwynne Whit-
by was a lawyer’s rather colorless wife and
Hubert Curling was excellently cast as the
husband who can’t see a rival in front of
his face. This Showman, having had con-
siderable .experience of the scenes and folk
depicted in “The Letter,” searched carefully
for slips in the production, but was unable
to find any worth mention, except the gait of
the G. and S. Celestials aforementioned.

On the stage nothing exceeds like suc-
cess and the consequences of being a popular
attraction are being visited on “The Ghost
Train,” which is having a revival at Melb.
Athenaeum. The entertaining mystery runs
almost too smoothly. Those original mem-
bers of the crew, Basil Radford, Hugh
Wright and Roger Barry, all natural actors,
appear a little blase, as if they knew they
could do it with their eyes shut. Madge
Mclntosh, an old acquaintance, provides
some of the fresh blood in the cast. As
Julia Price she adds nothing of importance
to the rendering Betty Ross Clarke gave in
the original production. In any case the
girl who wanders about England looking for
phantom locomotives is a melodramatic and
unconvincing person, and Miss Mclntosh
makes her more improbable by being a
thought more mature than the playwright’s
lines lead one to expect. Evelyn Shirley
and Leslie Palmer are other inconspicuous
additions.

“The Student Prince,” at His Majesty’s, is
still the chief competitor of the beaches in
Melbourne. “Our Wife” is only a moderate
attraction at the Royal, despite the stirliug
comedy of Margaret Lawrence. No changes
are announced for Saturday.

The revue at present raising the dust for
Melbourne Tivoli provides contrasts in the
dance. The Di Gatanos express the poetry
of motion, and the clever Van Lowe pro-
vides the doggerel thereof. There are also
“Eight Darlings” who are pleasantly rhyth-
mic and physically without a blemish. Hec-
tor St. Clair is a comedian whose capital is
all banked in his inimitable face. Most of
his jokes have had a long and distinguished
career in the public service, though “I knew
you when you were just a worried look on
your father’s face” may perhaps be an
exception.
It is rather rough on Galsworthy’s “Joy”
that all women shingle nowadays. John's
most oft-repeated joke in this piece is an
allusion to one of the characters having cut
her hair. As all the feminine side of the Little
Art Co., which presented the play at St.
Peter’s Hall, Melbourne, last week, had done
likewise, the humor was mainly of the uncon-
scious variety. “Joy” proved fairly sprightly,
despite its age—it is 20 years, which is
almost second childhood for most modern
dramas. Hettie F’enerman and Sylvia
Archer were the most inspired of a conscien-
tious cast of players.

Miss Phyllis Parlett sat bolt upright at
Melbourne Assembly Hall piano last
Thursdav and played the Waldstein very
pleasantly. It was interesting to hear a

sonata usually accounted profound thus
cheerfully and casually dealt with. There
is no special reason why, because a com-
poser wrote a piece in a mood of deep feeling
probably brought about by indigestion, every
subsequent interpreter should play it in
the same way, no matter how he or she is
feeling. Miss Parlett rattled through the
first movement with great confidence and
later on made Debussy, Rachmaninoff, Palm-
gren and Ravel seem equally cheerful. Her
panel of the local Lavater’s compositions
contained some melodious numbers. Ger-
trude Plutton sang a little-known aria from
Handel which had grace and quality.

The Melbourne Philharmonics, assisted by
the Uni. Symphonists, all under Bernard
Heinze, submerged a packed house at the
Auditorium under two' deluges of song
one night last week, the first flood
being “Hiawatha’s Wedding Feast,” and the
second “The Death of Minnehaha.” Long-
fellow’s versification bears to poetry the
same relation that a cyclorama bears to
painting, but the music the semi-negro
Coleridge-Taylor set to it is full of sur-
prises and delight. How they ate the stur-

traltos . and sopranos, though there was a
suggestion of indigestion in the basses, and
the solo love-song of Chibiabos, rendered
by tenor John D. Sullivan, was a trifle

work, Beethoven’s Choral Fantasia, ended

Melbourne pictures “The ■ Blue Lagoon”
at Hoyt’s. A colorful rendering in the flat
of Stacpoole’s well-known yarn about the
girl and boy who had to learn life’s ABC on
a tropic isle without any teacher but their
intuitions. “The Princess of Hoboken” at
the Majestic. A roaring farce about a
waitress who convinces some easily-deluded
people that she is a countess. In “Be-
ware of Widows” at the same address, Laura
la Plante is collaring other women’s sweet-
hearts with uninterrupted success.

Galsworthy introduces into “The Show,”
which the Repertory players produced at the
Sydney Palace on Saturday, an utterly pre-
posterous detective. This essentially un-
British sleuth, who has to investigate the
suicide of Major Morcambe, treats practi-
cally everybody in the cast as a potential
murderer, and breaks open private locks
with the air of right worn by a wife explor-
ing the pockets of a sleeping husband. As
the whole play is built upon the distress that
may be brought into a perfectly respectable
family by the intrusion of the police into a
domestic calamity, the obnoxious detective
was perhaps regarded as necessary, though he
is none the less an infliction. But for the
advent during recent years of the Keyhole
Press, the newspaper reporter Forman would
appear an almost equal monstrosity.
* # * *
In spite of the basic extravagances, Gals-
worthy’s play is interesting and is well
interpreted. A great deal of the interest
is sustained by the admirable Daisy Oldham
of Stella Marina; the lady is accused by
public gossip of relations with Major Mor-
cambe, which have given reason for the
suicide. Gregan McMahon is the honest old
father of the girl who had provoked the
gossip ; and there is extra professional assist-
ance from Arthur Greenaway, who fits well
in the essential character of Geoffrey Dar-
rel. Harold Walch is an editor who dis-
guises a conscience under sensational pro-
clivities. Most of the other amateurs on the
first night were weak and artificial at the
start, but warmed to their work later. John
Alison made a swaggering reporter who
should have been thrown out of the window
instead of being regaled with information;
A. S. Reardon was the Bolshevist detective;
and S. R. Irving became a convincing Colonel
Roland by the time the inquest was reached.
As the widow of the suicide, Helen Hol-
royd was distinctly successful in imparting
poignancy to the lady’s sufferings ; but Louise
Mclntyre was seldom in touch with the
real meaning of the part as Lady Mor-
cambe. The frightened slavey was very well
done by Betty Gregson. The Repertory
players put aside “The Show” to-morrow
night to indulge in “The Philanderer on
Saturday.

“Castles in the Air” will fade out on Friday
at Her Majesty’s, Sydney; “Wildflower” fol-
lows with a brief Christmas revival, which
will be Marie Burke’s good-bye. Byrl Walkley
steps into the shoes of the other lady in
“The Whole Town’s Talking,” which goes on
awhile at the Cri.; the appearance of “The
Cuckoo in the Nest” is announced for Satur-
day week. Moscovitch and “The Terror”
continue to thrill audiences at the Royal.
The Fullers make large use of the “House
Full” sign at the St. James; the success of
“Archie” has postponed the Christmas
panto, until the New Year. The Empire
management has had the luck of only need-
ing three pieces in the 10 months that the
theatre has been in existence; but now the
last weeks of “Tweekie” are announced, and
“The Film Girl” hovers in the offing. “What
Happened to Jones” goes on happening at
the Grand Opera House, where Frank Neil
is busy preparing “Mother Goose” for two
daily daytime sessions at Christmas. His
quaint idea is a panto, for children.

Jim Gerald, as Admiral Pitchoffski, steers
a new laughter-ship, “Once Aboard the Lug-
ger,” through waves of hilarity at Fullers’
Theatre (Sydney) ; but he is best in an epi-
sode where he forgets that he is an admiral,
and, driven to seek work by his wife, submits
four years of matrimony as a practical testi-
monial for a job as a lion-tamer. The
Ivailis, the Hawaiians who have been duoing
the Australian vaudeville circuits for
years, have been welcomed once more with
acclamation; the massive Queenie continues
to exhibit amazing grace in her dances.
There have been instances of quite deserv-
ing Proteans getting a rough passage from
Sydney Tivoli patrons, but Owen McGiveney
is fascinating his audiences nightly with the
dramatic Dickens story of Bill Sikes, where-
in he plays every character in turn. The
changes are nothing short of amazing.
Leaving the stage as Nancy the actor is back
in a flash as Fagin or Bill Sikes; the Artful
Dodger disappears, to be replaced bv some
other character in a twinkling. The act
is one of unusual interest.

The dinkum Australian Katz’s Saxophone
Band has struck such popularity at the
Tivoli that it is now put on just before the
interval, the switching on of the theatre
lights being intended to convey to the
audience that the curtain is down definitely
for a spell and a demand for further encores
is futile. In a brisk skating turn an
unnamed woman risks her neck by shooting
round the inside of a monster wheel-run;
Dick Henderson is farewelling to the accom-
paniment of undiminished hilarity, and the
Australian youngsters, Lorna, Lance and
Leslie, are as fetching as ever.

“What Price Glory?” Sydney Prince Ed-
ward Theatre’s new offering, is a war story
compiled with pacific intentions. The young
subaltern who gives way to hysteria at the
thought, not of his own danger, but of that
threatening his men would have been sum-
marily dealt with during the war, although
dramatically it may constitute a poignant
incident. The earlier part of the film is
rather woolly in its effort to show the
reaction of the license, brutality and waste-
fulness of war upon the young men exposed
to it; and the comedy touches are exag-
gerated to an extent that makes them far-
cical. But, towards the close, the story
has a gripping quality which it holds right
to the finely artistic ending, when the
two rivals for the affections of the French
girl are called away to the front line and
she, remembering that they have twice re-
turned safely but that their fortune is hardly
likely to hold, reflects passionately. “They
are too young and beautiful to die.” The
parts of the screen trio are very sincerely
played by Edward Lowe, Victor McLagen
and Dolores Del Rio.
Sympathetic characterisation makes of the
simple plot of “The Drop Kick,” screened at
Hoyt’s (Sydney) in partnership with “The
Demi Bride,” an unusually appealing story. It
includes a heroine who has none of the
abominable sophistication of the American
jazz-girl usually thrust into the role; and the
collegians who run the perils which moneyed
youngsters are likely to meet from compara-
tively elderly harpies have more manliness
and less showiness than is expected in such

Art in the Christmas mart:—
Lionel Lindsay follows the colored impressions of
his artistic vagabondage in Europe with an exhibi
tion of dry points and a few etchings; this being
more distinctively Lindsay’s line, the pictures, shown
at the Macquarie Galleries, Sydney, make a more
impressive effect. “A Street in Guadeloupe,”
with a masterly treatment of the light, especially
appeals; “A Smithy, Toledo,” is full of movement;
and “Toledo” offers a fine suggestion of infinite
detail.
The Painter-Etchers’ Society has hung its Christmas
goods on the walls of. a place called the “Attic
Gallery,” 393 George-street, Sydney. Sydney Long,
who always manages to put imagination into his
work, contributes 26 ; “Brisbane Water,” in sepia, is
admirably done, and the involved “Circular Quay”
is well handled. “Evening, Narrabeen,” shows Bruce
Robertson at his best; it gives a suggestion of
glowing evening over an admirably shaded land-
scape. T. Friedensen is effective in “Fording the
Creek” ; Gayfield Shaw in “Noonday Shadows,” and
H. Van Raalte in “Evening Symphony.” John
C. Goodchild gives, amongst some very fine etchings,
three good lithographs, including a rich-textured
“Brandon Bridge.” Jessie Traill, more familiar in
vigorous pictures of industry, surprises with a softly
grey aquatint, “Between the Showers, Carcasonne.”
John Shirlow’s best is “Kiosk, Prince’s Bridge.”
A. H. Fullwood, Fred C. Britton, C. H. Pereival,
Montague M. White, D. C. Reid, Herbert Gallop, James
A. Crisp, Ellis St. John, Helen Farmer, Herbert
Ross, Sheila McDonald and Eirene Mort are others
whose work holds more or less appeal.
Burdekin House is having its share in the Christmas
art exhibitions; the proceeds of the show of paint-
ings and etchings are to benefit the funds- of the
Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. Included in a com-
prehensive collection of the work of Australian
artists—there are about 50 represented—are copies
of a book of prints, “Old Colonial Architecture,” by
• W. Hardy Wilson, which every lover of old Sydney
should want to possess; it includes a very fine pre-
sentation of the portico of the old Macquarie-street
mansion itself.

Carter the Great vacated th. 3 Adelaide
Theatre Royal on Thursday to admit George
Carney and his comedians, in conjunction
with the film of the Dempsey-Tunirey fight.
At the Garden Theatre Fat Hanna’s Dig-
gers are being handicapped by adverse
weather conditions. At the Majestic Robert
Roberts and his Bon Bons continue to hand
out bright revue, with Syd Beck as chief
fun-maker. West’s Pictures are giving the
public a good British film in “The Flag Lieu-
tenant” with “H.R.H.,” consisting of inci-
dents in the life of the Prince of Wales, as
the supporting picture. There is an inter-
esting topical film of the Reso expsdition
to Central Australia. The evergreen
“Camille,” with Norma Talmadge in the
name role, is having another week on the
screen at the York, with “The Sunset
Derby” as a side-dish. At the Wondergraph
are “Senorita” and “Ranger,” with “Know
Your Own Country” featuring Australia’s
newest star in Lotus Thompson.
“L. de R.” : As was here mentioned when
Maugham’s “The Letter” was done in
Canada, a leading newspaper, on moral
grounds, refrained from noticing it. Mel-
bourne Age showed even greater delicacy
over “Cradle Snatchers.” It gave the play
half a column of reprobation and then stated
that it would not add to the shame the
actors and actresses must be feeling in taking
part in such a piece by printing their names.
There were grins in the greenrooms over
that. There are worse stage jobs than
being a moral reprobate. Having custard
pies squashed on one’s face and having to
fall into flourbins or water-troughs are
some of them. Anyhow, the Age comment
didn’t hurt the box-office. • The Argus
recently was more consistent. That journal
printed neither advt. nor notice of “JNot To-
night, Dearie,” Frank Neil’s latest essay at
the Palace.
“C. Ockney”: “Peg o’ My Heart” has
made its appearance in England as a musical-
comedy under the label “Peg o’ Mine.” The
“book” has been concocted by Frederick Jack-
son, whose “Naughty Wife” was in Renee
Kelly’s Australian repertory; Morton Selten,
well remembered in these parts, plays the
harmless necessary lawyer. A good peg on
which to hang songs and dances.
Poverty
Points
“Hamfat” : Warm-hearted Lee White has
sung her last song. Financial difficulties
were the lesser of her troubles during her
Australian battle to make good the losses of
a London failure. Although an operation
was a clamant necessity she kept going for
the good of the show, maintaining her stage
brightness whilst she flirted with death. Lee
White first appeared as a vocalist in America
at the age of 19, but passed into vaudeville
and then on to “revue.” She hadn’t much
of a voice; it was personal charm plus brains
that won her success. Death came long after
he was expected—but the lady was only 41.
“L.H.P.”: Emma Temple is going to Eng-
land for a trip. What charming imperso-
nations this gifted sister of Mrs. Brough’s
has given us since Australia first saw her as
Celia in “lolanthe” in 1885! She made a
lovely Claudine in a “Tambour Major” re-
vival. From 1887 to the end of the Brough-
Flemming era she delighted in many plays.
I never saw her fail, no matter what part
she played. Her last role here was that of
Miss Midgettt in “Outward Bound.”
“L. de R.”: The writers of musicomedy
have lost all faith in their inventive powers.
Almost every song-an’-dance show lately
staged in Australia has been a repressing of
old pulp. “Queen High,” the Firm’s next
American importation, which has been run-
ning for a year in N’York, is founded on
“A Pair of Sixes,” a farce-comedy. This
country saw it years ago.
“Old ’Un”: Marie Ney, who did most of
her acting on Australian stages and got little
encouragement from local managers, has
firmly established herself on the other side
of the world. When last heard from she
was playing leads in an English Shak-
spearean company at the Opera House,
Cairo. The crowd went straight to Egypt
from London —a novel and ambitious project
launched by the principals of the Old 1 ic,
where the clever Maorilander has already
appeared as Desdemona and Ophelia. For
the Egyptian venture Marie added Viola,
Portia and Isabella (“Measure for Measure )
to her repertoire.
“Craiser”: Scholards at Melb. Royal sat
back and snorted over some of the French
with which “Our Wife” is' besprinkled. “Au
revoir” sounded something like “oovow” and
“madame” was variously “maddam,” “ma-
dahm” and “ma-dem.” But isn’t the use of
any French at all absurd in a play which is
supposed to have been translated into Eng-
lish? Earlier playwrights got along quite
well without the mixture. There is no
Danish in “Hamlet,” nor Italian in “Romeo
and Juliet,” and Othello is convincing enough
although he doesn’t utter a solitary “Bish-
millali!”
“SKyrider” : Leading ladies did not always
live at the most exclusive hotels. A glimpse
of one ascending the Australia steps sent
my mind back to the days of my youth, when
I saw Florence Rignold, on the stage of the
Adelaide Royal, triumph over the fiend who
had hounded her through three thrilling acts.
How I loved that girl! The sight of the
telephone in me boss’s office gave me the
idea of acquainting her with the state of my
feelings, and I rang the York Hotel. Heaven
knows what I was going to say, but I was
certain that only the best pub in Adelaide
would shelter that divine presence. Then,
like cold water on my spine, came an icy
voice: “Rignold? An actress! Theatricals
are not accommodated at the York.”
“C. Ockney”: Dion Titheradge, who
started his mumming career in Australia
under his father’s eye and his literary ditto
by writing light verse for The Bulletin, is
winning success in England as a playwright.
His latest piece, “The Cro'oked Billet,” out-
Wallaces Edgar Wallace for crooks, thrills
and “mystery,” and has proved one of the
hits of the season. Wallace, by the way, has
temporarily seceded from the blood-curdling
business and written the “book” of a song-
and-dance piece called “The Yellow Mask,”
which, with postcard beauty Phyllis Dare in
the lead, is having a provincial run before
being put on at London’s Palladium. Winnie
Collins, Cronin Wilson and Frank Cochrane,
remembered on our stages, are also in the
cast.
“St. John’s Wood”: London has been grin-
ning at a controversy between Sir Oswald
Stoll and an American comedienne, Dora
Maugham. Dora was told that she must not
say “damn” on the stage, and a “damn”
slipped out. That led to a row and the
ending of her engagement with the Stoll co.
But the real trouble appears to have been
the cerulean tint of her songs. The lady
admitted that they were close to the knuckle,
but “Sir Oswald should be running a church
and not a music-hall.” she said.
“R.K.D.N.”: Australian theatregoers are
going to see a lot of Ben Travers’s work
during the coming months. Three of his
farces are to be put on in succession at
Sydney Criterion: “The Cuckoo in the
Nest,” “Rookery Nook” and “Thark.” An
imported company will endeavor to supply
the correct British atmosphere.
“Peter Pan”: Harrison Owen is not the
only Australian playwright shining over-
seas. “Old Mrs. Wiley,” by Harry Tighe,
was produced at the “Q” Theatre recently ;
Tighe’s “Open Spaces” figured at the same
theatre last January. “Open Spaces” did
not create much of a stir in London, but
has caught on at Dusseldorf and Stockholm.
“Cauboy”: Managements, in their eager-
ness to give the public what they think the
public wants, work a new fashion to death.
Take the mystery drama for example. Almost
every company listed for Australia is bring-
ing one of these psychologically silly pieces.
Leon Gordon is to open his tour in March
with “The Murder of Mary Dugan,” and
even the. artistic Boucicault has fallen.
Maugham’s “The Letter” is merely a mys-
tery play minus the sliding-panel and the
voice in the wainscoting. As for Mosco-
vitch, he began by preaching about the sacred-
ness of art —and then put on “The Ringer."
One of the best mystery plays yet brought
to Australia boomed for five weeks and then
found itself playing to empty houses. Per-
haps there was an omen in its title—“ The
Last Warning.”
“Lud”: I have seen no Australian refer-
ence to the fact that the late Walter Bent-
ley was the originator of the far-famed
Benson co. Benson made his first profes-
sional appearance with Henry Irving at the
London Lyceum in 1882. The critics slated
him, and he decided to go into the provinces
to gain experience. He joined what was then
known as “the Walter Bentley Shakspearean
Company,” which toured mainly in Scotland.
After a few months Benson took over the
concern, Bentley departing for Australia, via
U.S.A.; it then became known as the “Ben-
son Shakspearean Company.” It has lately
been rechristened “The Bensonians,” the vet-
eran proprietor having taken a partner—
Gerald Lawrence.
THE MIRROR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN..]
“ ‘lf the stage wants cleaning,’ said Sir Gerald
du Maurier, the actor-manager, ‘the fault must be
placed on ordinary life, of which the stage is merely
a mirror.’ ” —Melbourne Sun.
“Jill Citizen, to-day you stand arraigned
Before this worshipful theatric bar;
The charge, Madame, as heretofore explained,
Is that you acted like a Thespian star.
For three long, throbbing, hours, so it
appears,
You psychoanalysed your naked soul,
And talked of doubts and hopes and hates
and fears....
What’s that?.... You talked of cabbages
and coal?
HAD A BEAUTIFUL TIME.
“Did you enjoy the theatre this afternoon, Brother?"
"Oh, thoroughly. It appalled me, sir, from the moment I went in till I came out.”
“John Citizen, you come before us charged
With that you did, in your most trying
time
In that great world which is a stage enlarged,
Conduct yourself as would a proper mime.
You sat, revolver in your shaking hand,
With haunted eyes that past the veil would
peer,
Or else you toyed with poison, understand!
You didn’t?.... Eh?.... You went and
had a beer?
“Jane Citizen, be careful what you say!
Now is it not or is it true that you
Behave yourself, Madame, as in a play
Our best dramatic heroines mostly do ?
Did you or did you not go to the flat
Where lives the Other Man, risking the
wrath
Of your ill-understanding mate?.... Wliat’s
that?....
Too busy giving baby Bill a bath?
“Your Honor, it is hopeless, as you see;
Each prisoner the most cunning question
shelves,
And yet I have it on authority
That plays are mirror-pictures of them-
selves.”
Then Justice scratched its wig in doubtful
wise;
A harassed glance about the court it threw;
“Perhaps,” it said, “their statements aren’t
all lies—
There are, you know, distorting mirrors,
too!”

It will probably be news to many people that Ire-
land had her own Parliament over 150 years a£,o —•
but with very limited powers. It was Henry Grattan
who eventually secured legislative independence for
Ireland —though it was lost a&ain in
1800.
In 1780, when Grattan first intro-
duced his Declaration of Rights,
the Jameson family assumed control of the
famous Bow Street, Distillery, Dublin, and
from then until the present time the
essential quality of “J.J.” Whiskey has
never varied. Its purity and general ex-
cellence make it as popular to-day as it
was in the days of Henry Grattan.

That natural beauty of skin and hair which cannot be imitated can be obtained by
regular use of Rexona Skin and Facial Soap. Ordinary toilet soaps do not assert this
influence. Many of them contain free alkali, which tends to dry the skin and destroy its
delicate texture. Even the best of such soaps can only cleanse; they cannot heal and pro-
tect the skin.
Rexona Soap contains the same
soothing, healing, antiseptic Balsams
as Rexona, the Rapid Healer, the
value of which in the treatment of
skin affections is known throughout
the world. Simply use Rexona
Skin and Facial Soap regularly once
or twice a day, and see if it does
not quickly soothe and cleanse the
pores, lessen the tendency to
pimples, and leave the complexion
clear, fresh and velvety.

[FOR HTE BULLETIN.]
0 HEART of mine, what is that stealthy
thing .
To which I am attuned and listening?
The small clock ticking as its slow hands
creep,
With silver chimes that make my pulses
leap
And curve my happy mouth to smiles that
stir
Responsive to Love’s unseen messenger !
Tjie week has moved through dull oblivion,
But in my secret heart’s rebellion
I have imagined all the dear surprise.
The tender questioning of your grey eyes
When, at the hour appointed, I am wreathed
Within your arms, my name by your lips
breathed
Against my hair, till on my mouth your
mouth
Is crushed with sweetness honeyed as the
South.
See! Now the first star shines within tin-
night,
Destined to lead me to your heart’s delight—
My mirror speaks the burning of my cheek
That answers for my heart too wild to speak.
Now sings the clock the hour Love set apart
For my appointment at your waiting
heart!....
Life sings in all my pulses meeting you
(The jealous, unkind gods, what can they
do,
Since you can make, as long as night en-
dures,
My heart, my soul, my very dreaming
yours ?).
I see you, as I love to see you most,
Coming towards me an unquiet ghost
Against the starlit evening’s lilac fire,
With arms outstretched, a shadow of desire,
Till through a veil of kisses I can trace
Within the night the nearness of your face.

LOLA GORNALL.
The Widow’s Farm.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN I was a boy Burling Creek
marked the boundary-line between
my father’s land and the Widow’s
Farm, where Bella lived with the Widow
Dougherty. She was always known as the
Widow, and her farm as the Widow’s Farm,
even after she married Jim Mason. Bella
was fifteen the year her mother married, and
I was a year younger. Our fathers had been
friends and together had come to wrest a
living from the timber country along Burling
Creek. So Bella and I grew up together.
What little book learning we had was given
to us by my mother before she died.
My father was a shiftless dreamer and,
while the Widow’s Farm prospered, ours
became little more than a clearing in the
timber, which grudgingly yielded straggling
crops of wheat, as though the ground itself
lacked energy and purpose. Our house, our
sheds, our stockyards were rushed up “till
we’ve got time to do something better,” and
“temporary” structures they remained for all
time. Our boundary fencing was never
finished, so that the stock strayed to the
ranges or down to the thick scrubs along the
Daylong River, and most of them were never
recovered.
But on the other side of Burling Creek
a farm took shape and grew. Fields of wheat
rolled warm and thick over the foothills,
while on the rich land that fringed the creek
sleek horses and red and white cattle browsed
luxuriously in the lucerne, or wandered
through the tall cornstalks after the ears
had been pulled. And the energy that made
the farm, the driving force behind it all, was
Mrs. Dougherty. She was a part of it. Her
life, her soul, her very self were for the land
—her land. Season after season she attended
to its needs, watched over it with a fierce
proprietorship, a passionate intensity of feel-
ing great enough to be love. She was a big
woman and powerful, and she worked in the
fields harder and more skilfully than any of
the men. In her heavy cowhide boots and
old felt hat she worked summer and winter,
ploughing, clearing, harvesting, urging her
employees to greater effort, driving her frail
husband, until in the end he died, my father
said, of overwork.
There followed an interlude of seven years,
in which the farm, nursed by that indom-
itable mother through drought and flood,
grew and flourished. Then the Widow mar-
ried Jim Mason. Jim was a god to me. I
worshipped the physical beauty of the man,
his great muscles, his easy nonchalance in
handling the four-bushel bags of wheat, his
superb horsemanship. My father laughed
sneeringly when he heard of the marriage.
“Jim has feathered his nest,” he said. But,
boy as I was, I knew that Jim’s wishes or
expectations had but little bearing on the
matter. The Widow had taken him, had
taken his youth and his fine body, for her
beloved farm. And I know now that she
wanted sons —big sons, strong sons, born of
the land that was a part of her, begotten
of her body by the finest father in all the
countryside, bred for the farm as she would
breed her working horses.
As the years passed and no sons came, she
had no disloyal thoughts of the land that
had taken its toll of her so that she could
no longer bear children. Rather she blamed
herself, feeling in her heart that the land
had rejected her choice, that Jim Mason’s
sons were not worthy to be also sons of the
land. For she knew that Jim would never
care for the farm as she cared for it. To
him it was only a halting-place by the way-
side, where he might gather wealth and pass
on, leaving it drained of its richness to
whomsoever might buy. With the nearest
approach to fear that she had ever known
she thought of the fate of her land if Jim
outlived her, as he was likely to do.
Seeing her failure, realising all it meant,
rnd looking round desperately for a way
of escape, she discovered Bella—and me.
Here perhaps were figures to be moulded,
notential parents of sons that would indeed
be children of her body and of the land.
I don’t think she considered Bella’s existence
before save in the light of a farm drudge—
and I was the son of a shiftless dreamer.
Poor material with which to build, a for-
lorn hope, but still a hope.
So deliberately she set out to take me from
my father, to wean me from his shiftless
ways, to make me one with the land she
loved. More and more I worked for the
widow and less for my father. She was a
woman who knew how to wait for her re-
ward. She had watched her land lie brown
and bare beneath the pitiless sun of a
drought-bound summer;*she had seen the
floods and the hail and the bitter winter
frosts sweeping away the results of her
labor, smashing and withering, taking the
young life that she had created. But she
and the land had waited, knowing the time
would come when buds would blossom again
and blossom turn to fruit.
Gradually she won me over, until I in
very truth became one with the land. lor a
while I hated the farm as a cruel monster
who sucked away my life with relentless
greed. Then I loved it as a beautiful thing,
to be nourished and wooed. But in the end
it has come to be part of myself, as it was
part of the Widow. Not a place, not an
achievement, not a lover, but my very soul.
It has absorbed me and I am content. But
Jim grew restless. I don’t think he ever
realised what the Widow had done with him.
He had been clay in her hands, dazzled per-
haps with promises of easy wealth. He was
no more capable of loving the farm for itself
than he was able to grasp the Widow’s pur-
pose.
One night, while we were husking corn m
the big grain-shed I heard him say: “A
couple more years, old woman, and we 11 be
in Easy-street. No more milkin’ and chop-
pin’ for you and Bella, no more workin’ my
guts out from mornin’ till night. We’ll get
rid of the farm then and live in Sydney. A
comfortable house —and a trainin’-stable
maybe.”
The Widow answered not a word, but tore
the brown husk from an ear of corn, laying
bare almost brutally its rich gold. And once
or twice she looked at Jim, with a queer
smile on her thin lips, while he worked on
unconsciously, dreaming no doubt of his
suburban home with its small paddocks and
stables and the horses he would train.
Something of the Widow’s feeling towards
him must have communicated itself to Jim,
for, as I say, he grew uneasy. Perhaps it
was that about this time he became aware
of Bella’s budding womanhood. I know,
for Bella has told me so, that he held a
tremendous physical attraction for the girl.
But Jim was a good fellow, and I think the
Widow was wrong in suspecting him of any-
thing deeper than a genuine liking for the
fresh, healthy lass that Bella had become.
Yet the Widow did suspect him. It was not
jealousy that she felt, nor fear for Bella’s
welfare. She was far away beyond all reach
of jealousy or of any emotion that did not
centre in her land. But Bella had been
promised to the land, and to the land she
should come carrying no taint of Jim.
He kept a black stallion on the farm, in
a two-acre paddock enclosed bv a high
post-and-rail fence. It was a long, narrow
paddock, with a loose-box and feed-shed at
one end, and at the other end the fence ran
along the bank of Burling Creek. The
entrance-gates were on the upper side of the
paddock, down near the creek. In flood time
Romany was always taken from here and
kept in the stockyard behind the house.
For if the lower fence were washed down, it
would be possible for tbs stallion to get
clear away and perhaps join the bands of
wild horses that ran in the scrubs along the
Daylong River. I was afraid of that black
stallion. I hated him and he knew it.
At times I could do nothing with him,
and he would hardly permit me to walk
across his paddock. Jim laughed at my timid-
ness with Romany, and made my life miser-
able by insisting that I should attend to the
stallion as often as possible—no doubt witli
the idea that we would become used to each
other.
But over this the Widow took my part;
and once when Jim was speaking of the
stallion and taunting me with my hatred of
him, she looked across at her husband with
her level, plumbless gaze, and said:
“A fine horse, Jim—a fine horse to look at,
a fine horse to work, but a worthless sire.
Two seasons he’s been on the farm, and
what have we had from him? Only one
crooked-legged filly that died. The land has
no use for Ms fine body and his sleek black
skin. If he could get away he’d leave the
farm and join the wild horses. And the
farm would be well rid of him.”
One day Jim and I were boarding over
the top of an old underground tank with
heavy ironbark slabs. The tank was just
outside the stallion-paddock gates, and was
never used. It had been boarded over for
years, and the boards had grown so rotten
that there was danger of stock falling
through if they should walk over it. The
Widow stood watching us as we worked,
and, straightening my aching back for a
moment, I found her looking at Jim with
such evil brooding eyes that I almost cried
out to him as I would have done had there
been a snake close to him. I think he must
have felt my warning, for he turned round
suddenly and, catching his wife’s look,
flushed and grinned sheepishly, like a boy
caught in some mischievous act.
I was afraid of the Widow in those days,
there was something sinister about her.
An uncanny feeling rose around the farm,
a feeling of depression and impending doom.
We went about our work grudgingly,
grumbled over trifles, were irritable and
uncomfortably expectant. Then Jim Mason
was drowned, and it was as if a cloud had
lifted —or, rather, that the storm that
drowned him had scoured and cleansed the
the sky.
Rain had fallen through the day, and by
evening Burling Creek was a flood. While we
were at supper there broke the greatest
storm that I have ever known. It started
with a cannonade of thunder and hail boom-
ing on the iron roof. The hail stopped
suddenly and there was an interval of quiet.
In the deal silence Romany’s screaming
whinny came like the cry of some devil
escaped from Hell, and Jim Mason jumped
to his feet. Everyone looked at me, and I
felt guilty and ashamed, for it had been my
work to move Romany that evening and I
had shirked it.
Jim went out of the room and came back
lighting the stable lantern and wearing an
oilskin.

“If the creek rises any more,” he said,
“the fence will go and Romany will break
away to the river.” He turned fretfully
to Bella. “Come and help me; Robin is
useless with the black horse.”
The Widow looked at him very straight
and said quietly: “I’ll come, Jim.”
“All right,” he grunted.
And the two of them, wrapped in oil-
skins, went out into the blinding storm.
Bella and I were left alone. I think we
held each other’s hands; I know we were
afraid —not of the storm, but of something
that neither of us could name but that
each of us knew was there.
I don’t know how long we had been wait-
ing—there was no sense of time —when the
Widow came in again. Water streamed
from her clothes, and her hhir lay dank
and straight along her cheeks. She walked
over to the kitchen table and, blowing out
the lantern, she put it down. There was
finality in her action, as though the lamp
had done its work and was no longer needed.
Turning to us, “The fence is down,” she
said, “and Romany has gone.” After a
barely perceptible pause she continued,
speaking with no trace of emotion: “And
Jim, I think, is drowned—washed away.”
Through the night and the storm we
searched, calling for Jim, and at daybreak
we saw the havoc the storm had wrought.
We saw the wheat-fields flat and ruined,
the underground tank choked with silt, half
the fencing of the stallion-paddock swept
away; but we never found Jim, and Romany
was heard of no more. Men said that Jim’s
body had been washed down to the river
and that Romany, if he had escaped drown-
ing, had joined the brumbies.
* * * *
Bella and I have been married for three
years, and a week ago the Widow died. So
now the farm is our own. In the five years
that I have worked the place since Jim died
I have had no thought of wages nor have I
left the farm, save for a week when we were
married, and then I fretted so to get back
that I think Bella’s happiness was marred.
So, after our boy was born, I sent her away
to my mother’s people for three long months
of rest.
It was while Bella was away that I really
came to know the Widow, perhaps to love
hey. She and I and the Land were alone
together.
She was a hard woman —hard and bitter
and ruthless. But the day she died —ca-ncer
the doctor said—she called me to the side
of her bed and spoke quietly and without
bitterness. And once, when she spoke of
my little son. she cried softly, and I knew
it was not the pain that brought tears to
those long-dry eyes, for her face was calm
and wistful —almost beautiful.
“Robin,” she said at last, “there is a
feeling of storm in the air. Do you remember
the night five years ago when Jim was
drowned? I went with him and helped him
catch the stallion. Then I stood outside
the gate, holding the lantern high above my
head, directing him where to come, for the
night was black and the water was swirl-
ing around my waist. I heard him shout
as he rode through the gate, coming straight
towards the light. And I laughed, Robin —
I laughed.... for I knew that the farm was
safe.”
Even when she said this I only guessed
at what had happened. But to-day there
was a great storm. It rose behind Burling
Hill and swept across the flat to the Widow’s
Farm, driving the haymakers to shelter and
drenching the stooks of new-mown hay.
Bux-ling Creek broke over its banks and
tore through the young corn. Rising higher
still, it swept away the few remaining panels
of the old stallion-paddock and carried a
litter o.f rails and uprooted corn down to
the Daylong River. The crumbling, banks
broke through into the old well that had
been filled in the flood five years ago. The
racing waters scoured it out and, falling,
left behind the bodies of Jim Mason and
the black stallion.
NINA LOWE.
The Witching Hour.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE Brigade-Major clapped the ’phone
receiver back on its stand and slowly
pencilled the message received, “For-
ward-Situation—Quiet.” He yawned,
stretched his legs, glanced at the watch on
his wrist, and saw midnight—still another
hour of duty. Then with a sigh, he settled
himself over an open book on the table be-
fore him. It was an old French history
which he had found during the day among
the scattered furniture remaining in the
chateau, and for the last hour he had lived
among its pages, peopling the room with
figures from the past; but with the sudden
burr of the ’phone its interest had vanished,
leaving him with nerves a-tingle, and
strangely over-sensitive to the things around
him; the heavy breathing of his tired com-
panions, the wind sighing gently through
the trees, the flickering candles casting
strange and fitful shadows —restless shadows
tumbling against each other as they sought
exit from the room.
It was quiet to-night in the old chateau;
he noticed that, too; very quiet—and very
weird. Even the guns were still; too still
—their silence loaded the air with the mys-
terious.
He flung the book across the table, rose,
and with restless step walked to the window
and gazed out among the trees. Save for
the area of light cast from the room, it was
dark enough outside, though a full-grown
moon was struggling its way upward from
a bank of clouds behind the trees. ,
He stood thus for a moment, then selected
a cigarette carefully from his case, lit it—
and flung it through the window. My Lady
Nicotine was bad company to-night. Caress-
ing fingers made him drowsy, and he didn’t
want to sleep; too much depended on his
wakefulness.
Of a sudden he stiffened, listening, intent,
then he laughed quietly at himself. It was
only the old Brig, muttering restlessly in
his sleep. Age was a handicap under high
tension.
He sat again at the table to write, but
the figures from the history strutted across
the lines, tripping his pen, blotching the ink,
laughing in his face. He stretched himself
back in his chair and yawned again ; then
sat up and stared, for before him, low on the
opposite wall, he noticed a long, swaying
shadow with narrow fingers of flame color
broken with smudges of black; a paisley
pattern of light and shade/
Glancing up he saw a peculiar thing.
Poised directly over his head was a gigantic
chandelier, a massive glass arrangement of
fringes and diamonds, bevelled and plain,
with long chains of crystals, rectangular and
oval, strung together in loops, on each loop
a brass candlestick; and the moon, riding
low, was playing a straight beam through
the tall, bare casement directly on to this
hanging light, and thus gently spreading the
pattern on the wall.
“Hullo,” he exclaimed, “you’re a beauty;
the best of your kind I’ve seen. You’d look
well hanging in the old hall down south.”
Preening itself like a living thing, the
chandelier caught the candle-light till it
sparkled and pranced among its glasses,
reflecting and shooting flame from all angles.
The Major lay back in his chair, eyes up-
drawn to its beauty. He could see away into
long vistas of light, for the chandelier, sus-
pended by a heavy chain from the high,
arched ceiling, spread above him like an
enormous glass bell. Away to the right a
forest of swaying candles; to the left an
Aladdin’s cave sprinkled with shavings of
silver and covered with golden dust.
“What sights you’ve seen, old thing,” he
murmured. “Beauty and revelry by night,
I’ll bet. Things good and bad, things old
and new. But I’ll challenge you to say
you’ve seen an Australian soldier before.
It makes me darn drowsy to look at you,
though.”
Then far up in the maze of light he saw
them again, those figures from the past;
dancing men wigged and powdered, buckled
and stockinged; women in silk and ribbons
with gems a-sparkle and a-glow. He could
hear the tap of tiny slippered feet, and the
swaying rhythm of the dance as they moved
across the floor. But among all the beauty
one stood from the rest as a queen. She
glided, wraithlike, a beautiful vision of love-
liness, with eyes, glowing and laughter tremb-
ling on ter Ups; at her side a cavalier en-
vious and watchful.
The music ceased; the lady swung toward
the Major, and very gently touched her lips
with her fingers. The cavalier, with an
oath, flung back his hand and struck her.
The Major gripped the chair till the blood
was stayed in its course.
“You cur!” he cried.
Gently the moon withdrew its beam from
the chandeUer, leaving only the splashes of
light from the candles. He saw her now in
the gloom of the garden, pale moonlight,
coming straight to him. What carriage!
What beauty!
She came close, stooped and looked deeply
into his eyes. His heart was hammering
heavily; he felt himself strangely drawn to
her, could feel her warm breath upon his
face, could inhale a sweet perfume—what
was it? Ah! Lily of the Valley. She
placed a hand upon his tunic, fingered the
crowns upon his shoulders, touched the
badges at his collar, bent and whispered
A heavy step crunched the gravel, and
she turned sharply from him ; the cavalier of
the dance was at her side. He caught her
roughly by the waist and drew her to him,
holding her fast to stifle her screams; but.
slim and dainty as she was, she struggled
fiercely to free her hands, sobbing the while
with emotion and distress. Her right hand
swung free and the man fell back, grasping
his wrist in agony—a tiny dagger thrust
had drawn blood.
“You beautiful beast!” lie exclaimed, as
he turned to speed to the house. “I will
come again.’’
Hastily snatching a magnificent rope of
diamonds from her throat, she turned her
startled eyes full upon the Major riveted to
his chair, unable to speak. He wanted to
yell his fury, or whisper his admiration —
anything.
Quickly advancing she came close again;
he could see the tears glistening in her eyes.
“Monsieur,” she hurried, between her sobs,
“if you please, hide these !” She thrust for-
ward the diamonds. “In the silken couch at
your side; the spring you’ll find behind the
arm. I hear his step. Quick !”
The command broke the spell. He leapt
from his chair, grasped the stones from her
hand and sprang to the couch to obey.
The next instant he stooped on the edge
of a precipice-—a gaping hole in the earth.
The ground beneath rolled and trembled, then
split with a thunderous roar. The whole
chateau was rocking. He steadied himself
by the couch ; panes of glass shivered from
their glazing and crashed to the floor; a
cataract of water tumbled into the room
drenching everything around.
Lights broke from everywhere, revealing a
great, splintered gap high up in the wall —-
the jagged wake of a heavy “dud” shell which
was then resting under the bubbling waters
of the lake in the garden.
The Major stood stupefied ; figures moved
around him, hazy and dim. They spoke to
him, but he could not answer. He reeled
across the room to the wall, eyes open,
scarcely seeing.
Suddenly his eyes opened wide; he emitted
a long, low whistle, and pointed with
unsteady hand to the floor centre. They fol-
lowed his pointing finger.
On the floor lay the chandelier; beneath
its heavy weight, splintered and crushed, was
the Major’s chair.
“A close call, Major,” said someone.
He did not reply, but moved his hand over
his brow, then slowly crossed to the couch,
stooped and slid his hand under the arm.
The spring flew back and released the seat,
revealing a secret recess. He turned quickly,
seeking the necklet, but saw only the spark-
ling chandelier on the floor.
The staff-captain watched him intently;
then, gazing upward to the gap in the wall,
remarked. “She must have been a beauty,
that one.”
“She was,” renlied the Major, brightening,
“Beautiful as a Madonna.”
