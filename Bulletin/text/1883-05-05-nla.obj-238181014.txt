SATURDAY, MAY 5, 1883.
Blessed are the Rich.
In the course of a begging sermon, preached by a
fashionable divine in a Sydney suburban church,
the reverend orator made a particular appeal to
wealthy men to open their purses. Wealth, he
affirmed, is the gift of God. Therefore, ha some-
what il'ogically argued, the recipients of the gift
should give some of it back. We need scarcely
argue about tho reasonableness of returning pre-
sents in a case where the original donor cannot be
conceived to have become destitute. But the
appeal, although laughably illogical, was not
devoid of dexterity. It conveyed a comfortable
assurance that wealthy men constitute a chosen
people, specially singled out to be recipients of
Divine favour. “I am God’s man!’’ shrieked
Goitkau, when sentence of death was passed
upon him. “You are God’s men,” pronounced
the bland ecclesiastic to the men with fat bank-
balances. Here we have, in a nutshell, a clue to
the secret of the waning influence of the clergy
with the masses. It is the old story over again,
of the unholy alliance between professional theo-
logians and the great ones of the earth. What
tho prelate is to the monarch, the parson
is to the plutocrat—his very humble servant and
useful ally. Our clergyman’s doctrine of the
Divine origin of wealth runs on all fours with the
long-standing dogma of the Divine right of kings.
The latter position comprehended vast political
deductions It made resistance to regal authority
a flying in the face of the ordinances of Provi-
dence, and involved the logical conclusion that all
republics which owe their origin to successful re-
volt against monarohs, such as the United States
and France, constitute standing examples of em-
bodied blasphemy and impiety. These conclusions
are too enormous and too transparently absurd to
be susceptible of serious iusistanoe now-a-days ;
and, accordingly, they have ceased to be part of the
sacerdotal system—at any rate outside the circle
of State-paid clergy. But, although the ground
has been shifted, the spirit of adherence to the
most apparently profitable side is unaltered.
Whereas it used to be a token of an ill-regulated
mind to question that the monarchical form of
government was part of the Divine ordinances,
and therefore not only the beat possible system,
but the only one which was not positively diaDoli-
oal, it is now contended that tho unequal distribu-
tion of wealth which characterises society, as now
organised, is distinctly of Divine ordering, and,
therefore, incapable of improvement. Thus Con-
servatism becomes sanctified, and any suggestion
that existing conditions are capable of improve-
ment is rendered from impious
questioning of the wisdom of the Almighty.
• • •
We venture to controvert ovary one of those
propositions. Wo deny that tho possession of
wealth is a token of Divine favour. We deny that
the social arrangements which divide mankind into
rich and poor—those who have more than suffices
for their natural wants, and those who have not
enough to afford them even proper nourishment —
are the perfection of wisdom, and fill the limits
of what reverent and truly religious minds may
desire and seek to establish. We have it on
flible authority that “ the love of money is
the root of all evil.” In this case, money
and wealth are convertible terms. Tho clergyman
nattered wealthy men, because he wanted money,
then the desire of wealth is the root of all evil.
But wealth is the gift of God, according to tho
preacher. Then the desire of the gift of God is
the toot of all evil; which is absurd. But the case
ma y be demonstrated in additional ways. The

reductio ad ahmrdum there is no real need for
Proceeding, still, as one chooses to establish the
accuracy of a calculation by working it out in two

ost labour to examine this problem by separata
methods. There are various fashions by which a
an may become the possessor of wealth. He

sniaable proportion to their natural aptitudes
for exertion. They “make money,” according to
the current phrase. According to the fact, no man
ever made or could “ make ” money to the extent
that some acquire it. The processes of accumu-
lating wealth are so various, and some of them so
scandalous, that it fills one with amazement,
despite familiarity with the announcement, thatany
professor of theology or religion should, without
blenching, pronounce rich men the especial
favourites of Heaven. Wealth may bo ac-
quired by spoliation. A strong man or
nation may seize upon a province or a
whole territory, and become rich by enslaving its
populace. A man may become rich by roguery,
by usury, by penuriousness, by arson, by crimes
beyond definition. Or, as is more common, he
may amass wealth by concentrating every faculty
upon its acquisition, and subordinating every fine,
humane, or generous impulse to the one greedy
determination. Is the wealth extorted from the
necessities of struggling widows, or cozened from
the dissolute recklessness of expectant heirs, the
gift of God r Was the wealth of the planter, in
whose fields the whip was incessantly cracking on
the backs of negroes, the gift of God ? Are the
spoils from a scamped contract, a smart bargain,
a three-penny bar, or a terrace of high-rented
brothels, the gift of God, and the possessors of
such accumulations the chosen recipients of His
tangible grace? And it not such wealth, then
what wealth ? Shall we haste baek to inherited
wealth, and forget that money ill-got is said to
carry a curse—not a blessing—with it ?
• * •
Clearly there is Devil’s wealth in hand, and who
shall distinguish which is which ? Men sell their
souls to Satan for money to-day, just as they were
allegorically described as doing in the dim past
And when they have entered into possession,
comes a parson and blesses them for their riches,
with hungry beneficence. But, it may bo urged,
there are men who gain wealth honestly, and
handle it with clean hands ; and there is wealth
which grows to men. The city enlarges its boun-
daries, and the poor man’s field takes added
values of a thousand fold, and ho is rich though
innocent of greed. This is true. Bat there are
responsibilities in the holding, as well as in the
gatherng, of wealth. To hold it requires an in-
sensibility which is assuredly not divine. Through
the wide world unceasingly resound the cries of
of the wretched, the groans of the unsuoooured
wounded, the faint moans of those perish-
ing from hunger, and the whimpers of babes
withering in pestilential dens. While in-
fants gasp for pure air, worthy men sip cham-
pagne, and think no wrong. And a sleek custodian
of souls ascends to bear testimony, and comforts
them with assurances that they are the elect, and
their wealth the proof of it. Filled with a lofty
mission, the clergyman of to day knows nothing of
“ unearned increments,” or at least has nothing
to say of such secular things. And, thus perched
in the clouds, he loses his hold of the mass of
humanity, to whom “ unearned increment” pre-
sents a very real and very interesting problem,
directly bearing upon their moral welfare. They
want guidance about these things, and take it
when they can get it. And John Stuart Mill
becomes the teacher, while the ecclesiastic is but
a man who preaches about unpractical theories,
and generally wants money. Mankind is moving,
and the people crying aloud for guides. The
clergy, who wear the livery of guides, discourse
of the clouds, while the multitude ask how bread
should be apportioned. Unless the professional
theologists address themselves to satisfy the soul-
cravings of their generation, their influence will
soon depart from them, never to return.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Wasteful Waddings.
Every now and then familiar faces suddenly disappear
from society’s whirl. People—young people—who are
seen at every party and ball, who frequent the block
and the drive, who seem to breathe only the atmos-
phere of gaiety and pleasure, suddenly drop out of the
ranks. Where ? Well, they have been quietly married,
and there’s an end of them. Only a few friends pre-
sent; no fuss, no fashion. They have lived gaily; like
rational people, they have sipped Life’s honey in their
halcyon days. But they knew it couldn’t last always.
Having had a fair share of pleasure, they retire in their
tarn, and are seen no more in the old haunts. For nine
days Society wonders where they are, and then they
are forgotten and their places filled. Now, these are
sensible people. Their youth has had its joyauuce, and
they settle down to look for happiness in quieter paths.
And happy are they who can thus do it. With too
many, the butterfly flutter climaxes in a showy,
costly wedding, which really benefits no one, and
plunges the wedded ones into expenses they can
ill afford — the scattering of money they would
ten times sooner spend in their own way, and to
more advantage, were they not tyrannised over by a
foolish fashion. Except in those few instances where
persons can really afford display, quiet ceremonies aia
infinitely the more sensible. Society is ill-advised in
insisting on weddings so costly to the bridegroom.
Why oblige him to make the bridesmaids the happy
possessors of some expensive trinket, which is usually
their choice, not his—which, in justise to himself, ho
knows ho should not give from his slender means, and
which he is yet ashamed to withhold ? Why insist on
that fatal wedding-tour which has threatened to wreck
many a loving couple both in parse and affection?
Many a girl, if left to herself, would not expect these
things. Considering that she has accepted him for tho
sake, more than anything else, of having a home of her
own, and for release from the thraldom and narrowness
of domestic arrangements in a crowded and struggling
family circle, she would be quite content to go
quietly to some little suburban church, and bo
none the less happy and glad. But society arbitrarily
says no; injudicious friends egg her en, often a natural
maternal pride is not without blame ; and so the sense-
less display is made which gratifies society for a few
days and handicaps the young pair for months; whilo
parents, who hadn’t it to spare, have spent as much
amongst voracious tradespeople over the costly ortho-
dox fripperies as would have paid the young couple’s
bills for halt a year. These wasteful weddings are well
enough for those who can afford them comfortably
the majority cannot, and it is time there was a reform.
There are already indications of a disposition to
minimise the fuss, parade, and expense which now
make a man’s wedding-day such an ordeal. Brides of
good position have appeared in an ordinary pretty
dress, instead of a new white satin made on purpose at
a cost of a score or two of guineas, and probably never
worn twice. Formal and heavy breakfasts are some-
times omitted. And the tour that starts with the riee-
throwing has become generally shorter. These signs
are hopeful, and point to a day when marriage customs
shall accord with common sense. We look for the time
when a man may awake with his mind at ease on his
wedding morn, and may stand at the altar free from
that ugly thought, “ How much havo you cost me, my
dear girl P”
Cheap Law.
A. G. Taylor’s Bill to amalgamate the legal professions
has gone into the waste-basket of Parliament. It is to
be hoped Mr. Taylor will pick it ont and present it
afresh next session. It is a good bill; a people’s bill; a
bill to abate licensed plunder ; a bill to cheapen justice.
It consists effectively of a single clause:—“Every
attorney of the Supreme Court of New South Wales
may appear and be heard in all matters and proceedings
in every branch of the jurisdiction of that court with,
ont being required to employ a barrister." The only
fault we have to find with the Bill is that it does not go
far enough. Perhaps next session Mr. Taylor will add
to it another danse to the same effect as certain propo-
sitions which it was attempted to embody in the
Criminal Law Amendment Act, the other day. That is
to say, that a litigant shall be at liberty to appoint any
person he chooses to plead for him in any
oonrt. Ideally, the existing arrangement is pre-
ferable to indiscriminate advocacy. We admit
that. Nothing could ho more charming than
the conception of a body of experts and
trained pleaders, exercising their functions under
the control and surveillance of distinguished judges.
Thus the public have a warranty against malpractices;
against the avenues of justices being obstructed by
barriers of expense; against—oh 1 against everything
improper. The only objection to this is that it is ideal.
The supervision of the judges is not worth twopence to
the public in the way of securing cheap law. Ex-lawyers
every man Jack of them, all their sympathies are with
the profession, thumping bills of costs, and fat fees.
They are, in fact, effectively " in the ring,” and it would
be as sensible to look for a law-cheapening judge as for
a republican king. This is professedly a free-trado
colony. It is popularly held that protection adds to
the cost of commodities. Very good: let ua abolish,
protection to lawyers, and so cheapen law.
Speaker Barton.
Noi the least among the advantages which have accrued
by the change wrought in the Legislative Assembly by
the late elections has been the substitution of Mr.
Barton as Speaker for Sir G. Allen. The younger
man assumed the position considerably handicapped as
compared with his predecessor. He had no title to
command the obsequience of snobs. He had no wealth
to ensure the deference of crawlers and calculators. He
had no grey hairs to give him a claim to veneration, on
the Patriarchal or Casey system. The powers with
which the House invested him were all the influences
he could bring to bear upon cantankerous members.
His official frown veiled no secondary terrors,
unexpressed but understood, of what might possibly
happen in business to the man who had affronted the
Speaker. In spite of these drawbacks, Mr.
Baeton has proved himself a great improvement
on his predecessor. He has been firm without being
oppressive, and his watchful vigour has repeatedly
nipped disorder in the bud without respect
of persons or parties. Mr. M’Elhonb on the

EXTRAORD NARY CURE OF CANCER IN THE
EAR BY DR. (sTaNIUH.
Dear Sir,—I have pleasure in bearing testimony to the
great relief you have given me by curing me of a cancer
in the right ear, and I think my case should be made
known to the general public of this great city and
colony. My testimony is as follows: —When X was
about 14 years of age an inseot got into my right ear,
and I suffered severely from the pain caused so as to
nearly drive me out of my seus?s. In order to obtain
I relief, I went to the Eye and Ear Infirmary, at Liver-
pool, England, but did not succeed in obtaining rel ef t
was in need of, and I continued to suffer from excruci-
ating pains in the head and ear for a period of three
years, about which time the inseot came out dead,
leaving a discharge from the ear, which at length be-
came so offensive to all with whom I came in contact
that it made my lota most miserable one indeed. Ac-
companied with the discharge were severe pains in the
head. I went to several doctors, but could get no relief.
Their invariable remedy was to syringe the ear with
lotions which they prescribed. I went to New Zealand,
and became a patient in the Dunedin Hospital Whilst
there I was in a state bordering upon insanity, caused
by the diseased ear affecting the brain, and was advised
after being there th ee weeks to go to Sydney, where it
was said the climate, being warmer, would be better
for my complaint. I’, however, got worse, nntil at
length a cancer was to unseen protruding from my ear
I consulted a doetir of repute here, who put me under
an operation, which laid me up for several days, but
still the cancer grew. I gave myself up to despair of
ever being cureu, until one day I read of the wonderful
cure effected through your instrumentality upon the
Governor of thisiolouy. That encouraged me to make
another effort. 1 waited upon you and explained my
ease, and without any hesitation parformed a most
successful operation by removing the cancer entirely
from my ear, and within 10 minutes of the operation
being performed I experienced the greatest relief that I
bad experienced for the last 16 years. All that giddi-
ness, loss of energy, and languid feeling is gone ; and,
thank Providence, 1 fan ascribe this successful cure to
your skilful treatment of my complaint.
You can make whatever use you like of this, public
or otherwise. —Yours, &o ,

overnment benches, and Mr. Tati.ob on the Opposi-
tion seats, have equally felt the force of the Speaker’s
hterpositiona. And Mr. Bauton has shown a clearer
iitolligenee than his predecessor. Under the censor-
ship of the latter, considerable laxity had been tolerated
in some respects, while stringency, when particular in-
dividuals were affected, had been strained. “A factious
minority." or a "servile majority" are expressions
ust as dishonouring when applied to men in a body as
if a particular man were singled out to be attacked as
actions or servile Mr. Barton has perceived this, and
vetoed such imputations in wholesale. The aptest ap-
preciation of his merits wlxioh we have noticed comes
from the Dailt Telegraph, which, in a single article,
praises him for his s rictness with M'Elhone, the
Ministerialist, and assails him for his strictness with
Tayi-ob, the Oppositionist. Higher praise than such
an attack no Speaker need desire.
The Case of M'Gowan.
In 1871, at Maitland, William M'Gowan, a boy of lf>,
was sentenced to deatb by Sir Alfred Stephen, G J ,
or criminal assault. However, bis sentence was sub-
seaueatly altered to life imprisonment; and now, afteg
he has done twelve years’ hard labour, and has grown
into a man of 28 years, he has been released. Now,
until they read of his release, few people ever heard of
M'Gowan or his crime. Those who knew nothing
either of the boy or of his offence, clearly couldn’t
derive much benefit, in the way of example, from the
doom pronounced by the Judge. We venture to say
that a majority of the people of this country don t
know anything about the matter at all. Examples are
nothing unless you make them public. What’s the
gooil, so far as example goes, of entombing a man in
gaol, unless you constantly let people know, through
the Press or otherwise,! hat he’s still there and that ha
doesn’t like it ? The boy M'Gowan ought to have been
incarcerated long enough to get a good cowhiding, and
then he should have been let out—after the police had
been instructed to keep their eye on him And, if he
hod again offended, he should have been taken to gaol
and kept there altogether. A man who has grown
from boyhood to what should be the prone
his manhood in gaol (part of the time in irons), and
in the company of the most hardened scoundrels
on earth, is, and must be, a useless creature, and
likely to relapse into crime. Sir Alfred Stephen
has lived Heaven knows how many years, and apparently
still thinks most men are like some pot-plants stunted
while they grow in pots (that is to say, in gaol); and
that they at once become vigorous when yon transplant
them to the open ground, and the fresh air of liberty
and free citizenship. He’s a poor philosopher, is Sir
Alfred Stephen. Old Sir Alfred haa just got a big
increase in his pans’on, and ought now to have
some leisure. We recommend to him the case of this
M'Gowan, in the hope that he will look him up,
and examine him, with a view of discovering the
effect of the Tasmanian system of thoroughly
saturating with the filth of crime the heart and brain,
the body and sonl of every man, whether young or old,
who commits one single offence such as lands h m
within prison walls, and soaks him for years and years
in the pollution and villainy of the gaols. Sir Alfred,
with all his faults, is well-known to be a kind, soft-
hearted effusive old gentleman, who positively brims
over with the milk of human kindness. He merely
administered the law as he found it, you know. So we
hope he’ll spare no pains in ascertaining how much good,
if any, M'Gowan’s “twelve years’ stretch’’ has done
him At the same time lie may with advantage estimate
the probable good derived by the community from
the long imprisonment of the boy who is now a man.
Missed His Dart.
Mb. Sydney Smith’s motion, that tenders for supplies
required by tbe Government should te called for in
this colony, as well as in other countries, was very
neatly discounted by the amendment of Mr. Ninian
Melville in the interests of the Protection Party. At
the first blush, Mr. Smith's motion might bear the
aspect of a Protectionist suggestion. But a little
knowledge ©f the wheels which revolve within wheels
Showed it to bear a different complexion. As a matter
of fact, Mr. Smith’s proposal wa's directly traceable to
the contract for 72,000 tons of steel rails entered into
by the late Government with an English firm. The
motion was but the first of a series of manceuvres. Let
future tenders for rails ho but called for in the colony as
well as elsewhere, and a tender from the Lithgow works
would make its appearance. That effected, local in.
finances could be brought into play. Mr. Smith, Mr.
Sutherland, and others might haunt the corridors
of the Works Department and the lobby of the
Assembly. “ Proper representations ” wou’d come into
full swing; and unless a Ministry proved very
obdurate, and unprecedentedly insensible to the
danger of alienating support, the colony would one
day discover that the lowest tender for steel rails had
not been accepted, but that a slight preference—running
in the aggregate to perhaps a mere £100,000 or so—had
been given to the colonial article. The usual lucid ex-
planations and justifications would he given in all their
ordinary unconvincing force. There would be a splutter
of indignation in the country, too late to undo what
had been effected. A handful of men would pocket
£100,000 or so at the expense of the community at large,
and the little affair would rankle in people’s minds with
the direct affect of associating the very name of Protec.
tion indissolubly with the idea of chicanery, political
engineering and plunder, ever after. It Mr. Sydney
Smith claims to be a Protectionist, ho sails under
false eolours, and has shown himself a traitor to
the cause he professes. The genuine Protection-
ist merely desires fair encouragement to develop
an industry nearly self-supporting. That half-
a-dozen men should pocket £100,000 would not be any
aid to Protection. It would alarm and irritate the
public, and render them indisposed to listen to fair
and legitimate pleas. As President of the Protection
League, Mr. Melville did his co-workers good service
in tripping up Mr. Smith’s heels. The success of that
very keen gentleman's motion might have been, in the
long run, extremely advantageous to himself, Mr. John
Sutherland, and the coterie to which they belong. But
it would have been infinitely damagiig to genuine Pro-
tection, and the “grab” would have operated as a
scarecrow to frighten the public whenever that econo-
mic theory was mentioned. The Evening News, as the
organ of this politico speculative circle, fiercely fulmi-
nates against the Government, the Herald, and Mr.
Melville, for marring the little game. Bat, by so
breaking out, it merely exposes the game which
has been maturing, and throws a startling light upon
the interested reasons which spurred it into so much
bitterness when Mr. John Sutherland was not in
eluded in the Cabinet. The wickedness of the Govern-
ment, who, “as at present constituted,’* won't let any-
body make a rise out of the public funds, is bewailed in
terms which would be moving were it not known who
the parties a'O who want to make tiie rise, and how near
they sometimes stand to the throne in the News office.
British Rule in India
Me. Archibald Forbes, af ter his visit to India, said that
English hold upon the population of that country was
not worth an hour's purchase, were it not for the
military power which backs up the complicated social
and political re-adjustments which English rule has
imposed upon the subject races of the “gorgeous
East.’’ The average British Philistine sniffed at the
correspondent’s opinion; and at home and abroad wo
English have gone on thinking that we are administer-
ing India for the benefit of her people. A recent article
in the Times, which always represents the po «trfnl
proj udices of our race, whatever other considerations it
may neglect, shows that there was more in Mr. Forbes’
opinion than there was then or his since been attached
to it Among recent legislation affecting India a bill hss
been introduced to give native courts and native officials
jurisdiction over Europeans resident in their respective
dis'ricts. This proposal has evoked manifestations of
most determined hostility, and has raised such a storm
of prers criticisms, letters, and meetings as most have
rather astonished the simple-minded originator of this
innocent-looking measure, and the Times hacks the
dissentients. Now, we cannot think there would he
such a hubbub about nothing—the axiom that reaction
I is equal to action does not hold only in mechanics
Yet, to what a state the English rule in India must
have come, when the Europeans resident feel that they
cannot trust themselves into the hands of their own
officials, under the operation of their own laws, and
cannot rely upon any sense of justice among the people
they have governed for more than a century, and
among whom their influence has been great for more
than 2(V> years. That our rule in India has not been
either quite hurtful or quite beneficial to the Hindoos,
no ont; can doubt; hut there is something rotten in
our system when such a fact as we have commented
upon can he openly proclaimed without its importance
being generally recognized.

In the first place, none bat a Hum man would wrj>e :
« One of the many ne’er do-wells of which this happy
country abounds was reduced to a more than an utser
state of absolute impeounioaty, &o"; and, secondly,
none but a Bum man could ever have known such a
supei fluously adjective state of penury—except a Bum
mat’s hash supplier "Poeta Nasoitor": Your verses
are not good enough for us, though we should say if
you were to send them to the Echo they w mid be re-
ceived with rapture. You were not born to be a poet,
probably because you were torn to bo a butcher we
don’t know your trade but there is a suggestion of the
meat-saw in your metre. And, as thing-, go just now,
it is much better for you that yon are not a poet. If
you were a poet, you would have to get drunk to keep
yonrself from going mad, and then afterwards gee mad
for having got drunk. So attend to the shambles and
let the "sad seashore" alone, and you may perhaps
keep out of gaol and not go to hell till you die. And
as you have asked us, Heinrich Heine, whom yon will
probably meet when you arrive at the latter place, was
the great master of anticlimax. Here is an example
murdered in transla'ion by that industrious old
blockhead. Sir E. O. Bowring :—
«• I would the songs I’m singing
Had little flow’rets bean,
I’d send them to my sweetheart.
For her to sme 1,1 ween.
I would the songs I’m singing
Were kisses ail unseen,
I’d send them all in secret.
Upon her cheeks to glean,
I would the songs I’m singing
Were little peas so green;
I’d make some capital pea-soup, .
All in a soup-tureen.”
If you consider you owe us anything for taking all this
trouble with yon, you can pay ns in sausages. We want
to give the Shroud boys a picnic shortly "T. F. :

of the state of things to wh'oh we alluded, let us tell
you that Tasmania continued to hang me a for sheep-

for such offences nad been abolished by every civilized

German authorities don't favour bicycles, and
a man was lately fined f riding one in the street. In
Melbourne, bicyclists are mercilessly fined if caught
riding after dark without a light. At the Victorian
B C- Sports, the winner, 8. Bloomfield, covered t he five
miles distance in 16 min. 52 sbo. —Mr. K, O. Bishop,
of the Perucido Bicycle Club (Viet.) claims the quickest
100 mile ride in the colonies, performed in Tasmania on
17ih ultimo. Time 11 hours 19 min. What makes the
feat remarkable is tho fact that the rider is only 16
years old, and first mounted a wheel only 14 months ago.

At the Opera.
1'iie curtain rose—the play began—
The limelight on the gay garbs shone;
Yet carelessly I gazed upon
The painted players, maid and man,
As one with idle eyes who sees
The marble figures on a fii: ze.
Lang lark-notes clear the first act close.
So the soprano: then a hush —
The tenor, tender as a thrush.
Then loud and high the chorus rose.
Till with a sudden rush and strong
It ended in a storm o£ song.
The curtain fell —the mnsio died —
The lights grew bright, revealing there
The flash of jewelled fingers fair.
And wreaths of pearls on brows of pride;
Then, with a quick-flashed cheek, I turned,
And into mine her dark eyes burned.
Such eyes hut once a man may see,
And, seeing once, his fancy dies
To thought of any other eyes :
So shadow-soft, they seemed to be
Twin-haunted lakes, lit by the gleams
Of a mysterious moon of dreams.
Silk lashes yelled their liquid light
With such a shade as tall reeds fling
From the lake-marge at sunsatting :
Their darkness might have hid ths night—
Yet whoso saw their glance would say
Night dreamt therein, and saw the day.
Long looked I at them, wondering
What tender memories wore hid
Beneath each blue-veined lily-lid ;
What hopes of jojs the years would iring ;
What griefs ? In vain: I might not guoss
The secrets of their silentness.
Wuat of her face ? Her face, meseems.
Was such as painters see who muse
By moonlight in dim aveanes.
Yet cannot paint; or, as in dreams,
Strasge poets see, but, w hen they try
To carve in verso, are dumb —so I.
Tst well I know that I have reen
That sweet face in the long ago
In a rose-bower —well I know —
Laughing the singing-leaves between.
In that strange land of rose and rhyme—
The land of Once upon a Time.
O, unknown sweet, so sweetly known,
I know not what your name may bo—
Madonna is your name to me—
Nor where your lines in life are thrown ;
But soul sees soul—what is the rest ?
A passing phantom, at the best.
Did your you ig bosom never glow
To love? or barns your heart beneath
As burns the bud rose in its sheath Y
I neither know nor wish to know :
I smell the rose upon the tree—
W ho will may pluck, and wear fer mo—
May wear the rose, and watch it die.
And, leaf by red leaf, fade and fall.
Till there be nothing left at all
Of its sweet loveliness ; but I
L ove it so well, I leave it free—
The scent alone I take with me !
As one who visits sacred spots
Brings tokens back, so I from you
A glance, a smile, a rapture new !
And these are my forget-me-nots I
I take from you but only these —
Give all the rest to whom you please.
Sweet flowers no bittor weeds may choke,
I keep ye still to muse upon
Whan the dark night is creeping on.
And, drawing haughtily his oloak
Of purple oloul across his eyes,
The Cm jar of the heavens dies.
Sweat eyes, your glance a light shall cast
On me, when the dread ghosts arise
Of dead regrets with shrouded eyes,
And phantoms of the perished past—
Old thoughts, ©Id hopes, and old desire—
Gather around my lo:ely fire I
Farewell! In rhyme, I kiss your hand—
Kiss not unsweet, although unheard ! —
This is our secret, say no word
That I have bean in Fairyland,
And seen for one brief moment’s space
The Qaeen Titania face to face.

The Aatophone is a wonderful little instrument,
which, while it weighs less than three pounds, has the
lunge of a full-sized parlour organ, and executes its
music with absolute precision and perfect effect.
It has twenty-two reeds, plays in three keys, and all
the parts of most difficult music.
On it, a child can correctly play, without instruction,
any of its music, which at present consists of over 300
selections from Hymns, Oratorios, Operas, Waltzes,
Polkas, Marches, Popular Songs, &o. It is best adapted
to the kind of music which suits an organ best, in wtiioh
chords predominate, but also has wonderful power in
executing very lively pieces.

Extract from the Continental Gazette,
Paris.
The most surprising triumph for an American product
at the Paris Exhibition was the success of E. Anheuser
& Co.'s Brewing Association of St. Louis, which
eelipted Bass, Barclay and Perkins, Alsop 4 Guinness,
the world-renowned English brewers, as well as hun-
dreds of rivals from Austria and Bavaria. It is not
surprising that a great sensation was produced when it
was understood that the experts reluctantly pro-
nounced the St. Louis beer “superior to any malt
liquor ever drank upon the continent,” and that ail
Paris is now seeking to quaff the American nectar.
Sold by all First-class Hotels throughout Australia

A very old colonist, Mr. George Howard, died at
Very borough (Q.) last month, aged 73. In 1831 Mr.
Howard came tu Tasmania. He worked as a bookbinder,
f, ind lived in turn in Hobart, Sydney, Melbourne,
ud Maryborough, of which last town he was called the
Fitter. He was one of the oldest Master Masons in
Qieineiand, and of Oddfellows in Tasmania.

marks almost a new era in history.writing by its style.
It ia really history, not merely the " drum and trumpet”

that is necessary to record in a country’s annals. Mr.
Oreen died at the Sanatorium, Mentone.
The Age says Mr. G. E. Morrison (son of the
principal of Geelong College) has just completed a walk
from the Gulf of Carpentaria to Melbourne, 2000 miles,
in 120 days, alone and unarmed, and generally camping
out. It’e a big walk ; and what we want to know now
iihow many relics Mr. Morrison has got; whether he
•aw Leichhardt: what Classen said to him ; how the
LaK-bred German children are, and if he can tell any-
thing about poor Clarke, whom the gallant Hungerford
left in the bush and forgot to remember when he got

Mr. Hugh Mosman, one of the prospectors of
Charters Towers, left the North for England, with the
istention of having a final operation performed on his
am, which was severely injured by the explosion of
dynamite at the Broughton, twelve months ago.
Several painful operations have already been performed,
bat the stump has never ceased to trouble him, and it
it probable that amputation at the shoulder will ha
found necessary. Mr. Mosman was, prior to has de-
parture, entertained at a champagne spread by a few
(rianda at the Boyal Hotel.

Mr. J. J. Allman, late P.M. at Goulburn, died
wth instant. He had been fifty years in the public
jemoe—was appointed Clerk of Petty Sessions at
Piteraon in 1829; filled a similar position at Maitland
from 1832 to 1810; in 1812 was made P.M. at Muswell*
brook; in 1846 entered the Customs; was appointed
P.M. at Goulburn in 1862, and on retiring received, in
woognition of his services, a Government gratuity of

then, again, every ore isn’t cynical. And, by the way.
the Governor should be particularly dear to the Medical
Society. He always calls in the hiehest class of pro.
fessional aid. The editor of the Australasian Medical
Gazette will boar us out in this observation.
It’s really curious to note to what petty mean-
nesses small minds will descend. The Brisbane Tele-
graph publishes some studiously offensive verses, in
which all the assumptions and lies which have been
going the rounds respecting the pretended connection
between the Lind League and the Assassination Circle
are repeated. Bat as though this were not sufficient
evidence of stolid pettiness, the verses are signed
“ Eva,” a signature which everyone in Queensland asso.
oiates with tha wife of the Hon Dr. O’Doherty, M.L.C.,
as having been the nonude plume under which that lady,
daring the) “ Young Ireland” era, contributed stirring
patriotic poems to the Dublin Nation. By the device
ef using this signature, therefore, the Telegraph —
ominous name—succeeds in combining an eruption of
unreasoning prejudice with an affront to an amiable
lady as palpable and cowardly as if they had sent up
their writer to slap her face. In fact, more cowardly,
because Queenslanders would not have stood that. The
spirit, however, is the same as that fury which claps
delicate ladies into gaol for providing ejected women
and infants with shelter from the wind and rain, and
calls that sort ot humanity “ incitement to refuge to
pay rent.”
Young Sal way, who has carried off the first
prizes for the designs for the now Melbourne metro-
politan railway stations, is a native, and the natives are
vary proud of him. He served his time to Messrs.
Reed and Barnes, and it is currently reported in archi-
tectural circles that the plana for the Melbourne Town
Hall were chiefly designed by Salway when in Messrs.
Seed and Barnes’ employ. After completing his ap-
prenticeship, Salway started on a travelling tour,
taking England, the Continent, America, and China in
his trip, and now he returns to his native Victoria to
carry off the prize designs for a work that represents
nearly a quarter of a million sterling, upon which his
Srofessional commission of 5 per cent, will turn in a
andsome sum. Another native to the front is young
T. K Dow, a younger brethor of Mr. J. L. Dow, M.L.A.
for Bara Bara and agricultural editor of the Leader,
The young brother is a pupil of the elder one. After
receiving his training on the Leader, the Argus people
spotted him as a desirable hand for their weekly, and
induced him to transfer his services on the understand-
ing that he would ultimately obtain the corresponding
position on the Australasian that his brother holds on
the Leader. America offers a wide field for the gleaning
of information of value to Australian farmers and
pastoralists.
The moat prolific writer in Prance —to whom
Voltaire, Victor Hugo, or Dumas would seem but a
sluggard—is Jules Claretie. He is dramatist, novelist,
critic, historian, above all, a journalist, and ho is only
42 years old. In books alone, he has produced over
fifty printed volumes of average size. He is successful
and happy; he never knew the hardships and struggles
felt by most literary men—either when they’re climbing
up the hill of Parnassus, or going down it; and his
home is elegant and comfortable. He was intended for
a doctor; he tried law, and he chose journalism. One
cold December morning in 1858, he entered the Gaulois
office, timid and beardless, and said : *• I have ventured
to bring an article for yonr estimable journal.” He
laid it down. It was a prose poem- The editor picked
it up. He read it, and said: “ It will appear next
week.” M. Claretie married early; his social life has
always been one of exemplary morality. His literary
career has been one of wonderful industry, exactitude,
and inexhaustible fecundity. He writes with violet ink
because it flows freely ; and on white letter-paper, be-
cause he can afford to. His immense production can
only be maintained by regularity, and readiness begot
of ceaseless practice. M. Claretie has the manuseript
in a drawer, of ten volumes of misoellaueons writing,
which never was or will be printed, the production of
his immature youth ; and when ho shows these, he
says: “Voila! I write with facility to-day, because 1
acquired that facility laboriously when I was a boy.”
Pour hours a day now suffices for tho production of the
necessary amount of “copy.” Yet this great man
makes a curious confession. He is so timid that he
frequently abstains from entering a shop when he wants
to buy; he has allowed known flaws to continue in his
plays rather than hurt the manager’s feelings by altera-
tion ; ho posts newspaper articles, not daring to enter
the offices ; and he says: “ I have the air ot a man of
the world, and I am a savage. I am to be seen here and
there and everywhere, and yet I never feel at ease ex-
cept pen in hand before my work-table. Ah, work! it
is my life 1”
A tale of deep interest comes from Canterbury,
N.Z When the Bev. Mr. Green and his two bwiss
guides stormed Mount Cook last year, there was talk of
an Alpine Club—which, however, was never formed. It
was reserved for another foreign visitor co step in, and
take from our countrymen the glory of being the first to
scale the Hoohstetter Dome. Aye I and a lady, too.
Tho Dome is one of the celebrated peaks in the same
range as Monnt Cook; and, on the 1st Maroh, Dr. von
Lendenfeld, his wife, and a male companion, started
from Christchurch, Delay at swollen rivers, forming
camps, etc., passed three weeks, the preliminary
marches were made, and, on the 25th Maroh, the trio of
climbers moved from their last halting place at 5 a.m.
for the summit of the Dome. Crevasses, walls of ice,
and broken glaciers caused immense trouble. Dr.
Lendenfeld asserts that nothing in Switzerland equals
the view from their breakfast place at 9 o’clock, and
that the vast expanse of snow and thiok-ribbed ice is
unparalleled in its frozen immensity anywhere except
in Thibet. The glaciers bore the appearance i»f having
existed since creation, and were hundreds of feet thick,
and the yawning chasms were of unfathomable depth.
Just before reaching the final summit, the travellers
were confronted by a black abyss whose ioy walls were
1000 ft. sheer down. Bounding this, by 6 p.m , the Dome
was reaohed after twelve and a halt hours ot fearful
climbing. Mount Hoohstetter was conquered, and, as
the daring three sat astride of his sharp ridge, they
saw a sight the like of which has never parhaps been
vouchsafed to mortal man. For the sun set as they
sat up there between heaven and earth looking on
the eastern and western expanse ot illimitable sea; and
whan the orb of day slipped down behind the
western horizon the immense expanse of ocean for
a short space shone like a mirror ot molten gold.
Then, as the peaks turned purple, they started down,
crossed the vertical crevasse, whose glistering, splintery
crags ot trellis-work of glassy ioo were lit up by the red
gleam of the setting sun behind into a picture of in-
describable and haunting beauty, and, as the night came
on, halted on a bench hewn oat of the ioe for a brief
rest and refreshment. When the full moon rose, thoy
travelled on, reaching the flat part of the graoier by
midnight. Still on over the rough and broken ioe till
dawn, and then, as “ the orbed maiden with white fire
laden” sank down behind the jagged peaks, the sun
rose red and strong and lighted up another changeful
scene ot marvellous beauty on the monntain sides. At
eight o’clock camp was reaohed. after twenty, seven
hours of continuous motion, broken by less than two
hours’ rest. Dr. von Lendenfeld and his wife are Aus-
trians.
Mr. Marks Hermann, the Jewish gentleman who
charged young Petty, of Melbourne, only 1400 per cent,
interest on the loan of a large sum, is a holy man —he's
president of the East Melbourne Hebrew congregation.
The rale in Melbourne Jewish oiroles, therefore, clearly
is that the most rapacious usurer gets the front seat in
the temple. However, as all suoh things are perfectly
legal, it is plain that the temple has not yet become a
den of thieves. Mr. Aaron Waxtnan, by tho way, was
examined in the Supreme Court, last week, concerning
Petty's affair, and deposed, among a variety of other
things, that he had lent £4000 to Petty at 25 per cent,
per annum payable quarterly, with compound quarterly
interest —the security being a perfectly good one, viz ,
Petty's interest of £11,000 under his deceased father's
will. A clause was inserted in the agreement preventing the
insolvent from paying off the principal until he came into
his property. In other words, this rascally leech, hav-
ing got his suckers buried in Petty’s carcase, wasn’t
satisfied with 25 per cent, interest—he wanted to have
it up to the very last kick of Petty’s financial existence.
As a lot of people are now interested in Aaron Waxman,
J.P.,—for, as previously stated, ho is a high priest
of the law just as his brother ootopns is a high priest
of the church—we may mention that David Henry,
the “financier” whose jury-bribing aud gaol-malinger-
ing adventures are fresh in the memory ot our readers,
was formerly Waxmin’s deadly business enemy. Each
ran a loan-bank in Melbourne, each advertised largely,
and each struggled hard tor the ascendancy. Waxman
is a Polish, Henry ia a German Jew. Waxman was dark
and comparatively lean; Henry fair (we don’t say in his
dealings) and smug, and highly respectable; he went
on the virtuous and semi-benevolent ticket. He bad
| tho pictures of all his relatives—very nice-looking
relatives they were, too—hung up in what poor Marcus
Clarke ufod to call his “surgery;’’ and there was a
gaudily gilt Bible in the place, and pictures galore—for
after your usurer has made his money he almost in-
variably goes in for the fine-arts Well, Waxtnan went
on the even tenor of his way, clutching orders and
sewing-machines and pianos and so on; while the
more ambitious but loss level-headed Henry, who
wanted to make money fast, indulged in land specula-
tion, and got himself into very deep water indeed. It
was then that Aaron Waxtnan sailed in, bought his
enemy’s house, and by way of a final triumph,
went to live there —to live in the ancestral
hail of the Henrys in East Melbourne. Then
David Henry mot with a little accident—he was
caught in the act of trying to “ embrace ’’ a Supreme
Court jury, and was “ sent up ” for two years. He used
all sorts of influence with a view to obtaining his re-
lease, but Ehadamanthus was inexorable. When he
pleaded first that he was dying, the authorities sent up
Dr. Bobertson, Melbourne's most eminent diagnostician,
to examine him, and the doctor replied that Henry was
a very nice, clean, fat old gentleman, indeed, and was
doing ae well as could ever be expected. Then David
brought forward the fact that he had saved a great
many people from drowning, and was deserving of at
least a little consideration on that account; whereupon
Marcus facetiously observed that David had seen many
people sink in another sense, and had not attempted to
save them. Henry is once more to the fore with his
benevolent loan-office, and Wax man has dropped In for
what to a sensitive Christian would be a little bit of bad
luok. However, he has done nothing that is not per-
fectly legal, and as he is pretty thick-skinned, he can
afferd to smile. Even David Hoary oan’t got much
satisfaction out of the affair.
Mr. Charles Orton, now in Sydney, favoured ua
with a call on Saturday last, and obliged us with various
interesting items respecting his present mission in con-
nection with the lunatic, Creswoll, in whom he claims
to recognise his brother, Arthur Orton. Of coarse,
everyone knows that the modern mystery and man-in-
the-iron-mask—the Claimant, —now ia Portland prison,
is held by the law to bo Arthur Orton. Charles Orton
himself swore at the famous trial that the Claimant is
his brother Arthur. He now alleges, however, that
he was at the time swayed bv extraneous impressions
and stunned by confusing influences to the extent ot
arriving at a conviction which his deliberate and
cooler judgment have sinoe reversed. He doesn't
now believe that the Claimant is his brother
We noticed in a Sydney daily, the other day,
a statement that Charles Orton bears a striking resem-
blance to the Claimant. We have no doubt the
opinion was given in good faith. It serves to show
how desperately confusing and contradictory ovi-
denoa of Identification may be, when we offer out own
opinion that in the features ot Charles Orton wo could
trace not the slightest resemblance to the traits of the
Claimant, as presented in his portraits. Charles Orton
is a hard-featured man, with prominent irregular nose
and hollow high-boned cheeks. The very antipodes, to
our mind, of the soft contours and plump outlines of
the Claimant. And portraits of the rest of the undis-
puted members of the Orton family, both photographs
and engravings, show a strong family likeness to the
lineaments of Charles Orton. They are all large-boned
meagre faces. Mr. Charles Orton informs us it is not
true that he is in receipt of a pension from the Qovorr.
meat or from the Tiohborne family. There is a decided
split in the “SirEoger” camp just now. Mr. Smith
and Charles Orton, who came out at the exoense
of the English sympathisers with “ Sir Eoger,” are
at loggerheads, and agree in nothing save a
conviction that the lunatic Creswell is really
Arthur Orton. 0;<i the other hand, we have explicit in-
formation that Creswoll has been identified just as
strongly as being—Creswell. His career from the day
he landed is said to have been traced step by step, al-
ways as Creswell. The Creswell episode is, in fact,
just as bewildering as almost every other of this, the
most remarkable of modern mysteries, or impostures
We have not read the whole evidence ot the historical
trial —we doubt it anyone over did. But our impression,
founded on imperfect data, and therefore worth little,
has always been that the Claimant was defeated and
afterwards convicted on strangely dubious and contra-
dictory evidence. We mean on evidence which had all
been contradicted in some respects. We suppose the
absolute truth will never be known till the Day ot Judg-
ment. The movements of the “ Sir Boger ” deputation
in this colony have created a good deal of interest
throughout Australia. We have, for instance, a letter
from a person in Victoria, who also had a communica-
tion in a Southern paper to similar effect. This per-
son sta*es that he was a schoolfellow ot Arthur
Orton, and for many years a near neighbour to and
well acquainted with his family. If Crosswell be the
man, “ his upper teeth project, and he has an nngainly
style of walking.” Some years ago, our correspondent
states, he purchased from Arthur Orton some Shetland
ponies, “ a circumstance he would reoolleot.” “ He
would also reoolleot my name. I can easily identify
him.” Our correspondent is provokingly vague as to
where the purchase ot ponies was transacted, and as to
the date. The legally recognized Arthur Orton has
now been about 10 years in England, urging his suit,
and serving his sentence. If the Claimant be Arthur
Orton, it is certainly not his one to remember circum-
stances attesting that fact, as he sticks ta it that he is
not Arthur Orton, but Sir Boger Tiohborne. On the
other hand, if Cresswell be Arthur Orton, ho ie a poor
lunatic creature, mostly incapable, we believe, of recol-
lecting anything—although wo understand he did reoog-
niza a lady who knew him as Creswell and as not being
by any possibility Arthur Orton. Again, however, it
is queer that the Creswell, whose history has been
traced and linked with the lunatic now claimed by
Charles Orton to he identical with his brother Arthur,
arrived in the colonies in charge of ponies or horses.
It’s a mixed-np business, any way ons looks at it.

the rival crew there arc undoub'ed signs of over-train-

heavier, and the supposed faster boat suffers ignomini-

Mr. T. B. Dixon, to whom we, with the t-ff ability
(or which we are generally famed, gave a ‘‘send off”

Momkiy night, and had a capital house The perfor-
mines was heirtyall through, and in consequence of
tlie pianist not turning up, Miss Theresa Horan pre-
sided at the piano, and played as much of the accom-
paniments as she could scrape together on such a short
notice. It was an aff *cting thing to behold the sweet
Theoesi in a black dress and a fair wig racing for
musical goals with the man who played the violin ; but
itwss wore affecting still when she sing a duet with
the lesejifiarc, the purport cf which wado not distinctly
remember, bnt the burden cf which wa think was as
follows:—
“Pay my ton bob fine, dear mother.
Let me not pray thee in vain ;
Take me from the look-up, mother,
I will ne’er get drunk again.”
this lyric was applauded to the echo, and both Mr
Dixon and the fair cantatrice received something very
like an ovation. We should have applauded ourselves
tsojbut. we know from experience that one-and-sixpenny
kids will succumb to minual enthusiasm at the very
first bang. In the programme Miss Horau figured as
“Jsssie,” and in Melbourne she blazed theatri-
cally as “ Tessiewhile at the Sydney Royal

somewhat confus.ng to the conscientious critic
who wishei to immortalise her. If this nice young

decided on, wa will endeavour, in our humble way, to

hotel is an incentive to drink, and constant drinking,
by such men as Arthur, would give the landlord disease
of the heart. Bnt, anyhow, a hotel, even of the piorest
kind, is better than a bar-loft. When wa go off on a

Mr. Josh Piokersgill has written us a very long
letter, tho gist of which seems to be that “ Pick" is
about to travel through New Zealand with a diorama-
some one else to put up the “shag,” and Josh to lec-
ture. Alter maih that is complimentiry about our-
selves — and which with charaoteri-tio modesty wa
abstain from quoting—Josh say*: “ The suojeotof the
panorama, I now tell vou, is • Mirk Twain’s Innocents
Abroad,’ with aboat 75 large paintings. My stage will
be better appointel than anything ever done out here.
I have, as you know, made mv name in thv colonies as
a first-class sneaker, notably in old Melbourne, and you
know me wall enough to know that when I get in front
nf those historic s ieaes, as viewed by that Fxoursion
Party, from New York to the Holy Land, the Conti-
uent, at sea, &o., I shall do justioo to the opinions
hitherto held of me as an orator. This is
not blow, but fact. I am going to make
money, and stick to it this deal ’’ Wa hope so very
much Nexo to having money onrso'ves, we should
like to see Josh “ hold it ’* We knew J P when he was
a prosperous wine merchant in Melbou ne, and famed
as a raconteur. That was before he saw Pomeroy. No
sooner had ho partaken of the dramatic Upas tree than
he sold off all his nice grog and things, and became a
theatrical manager. He caught the dramatic fever,
poor ‘‘Pick," and has evidently not got over it. And
never will, we suppose. We know several people in a
similar predicament. They were all like Josh. When
they caught the malady, they sold off things. We wish
"Pick," thonsh, a happy iss.ni out of his dioramio
dream. For wo love him.

Mr. Bignold will play ten nights more at the
Royal, and then will seek fame in other climes—or win
it. For it goes without saying that Gscrge must bo
famous in wnatever part of the universe ho strikes We
don’t know why, but it is so. And prior to departing
from a city in which he has covered himself with glory
he will give us “ Clanoarty,” “ Alone," and " Black-
eyed Susan ” For this relief, mueh thanks. Fernaps
the best thing Eignold does after hia Henry V. (by
which he has rendered himsolf immortal I) is Colonel
Ghalioe in “ Alone.” This oomody-dratna is capitally
written, and George’s Colonel is very great indeed, His
Earl Clonoarty is also good, bat the play (the best ever
Tom Taylor wrote) is too high-class to draw a down-
stairs iladience. As a matt tor of fact, snob plays as
the “Romany Eve," full of spurious sentiment
and ineffable bosh, demoralise the public, and
actually keep people out of the theatre when a
piece havinar some claims to the classical forms the
piece do resistance of the programme. No one with any
intellectual culture could sit the “Romany Eve" out
with pleasure. In its every scene are marks of a tired
brain and a feeble imagination But for the extrava-
gantly brilliant mounting, "The Romany Rye," even
here, would have been whistled eff the boards But the
scenery saved it. People who cannot comprehend that
dialogue is claptrap, and that “situation are thread-
bare, still appreciate pretty stage pictures. And tho
pictures of Mr. Hennings are pretty stage pictures—et
wild.

We entered. Tho place would have looked like
Paradise, only there were to many money-lenders in the

There was such a crush on Monday night that, until a

wou'd perhaps have been there bow only that Mr.
Dunning was good enough to perch on the rim and
lower a string of gossamer down to us. When the rich
lady who is going to fall in love with us for our genius
turns up wo shall reward Mr. Dunning with a gold-
mounted natshell to sleep in.

Lsvifcy aside, however, “ Manila ” is as pretty
as an opera as Miss Chard is as an opera artiste This is
tho mint for words. We are not carried away on the
wings of wonder by its musical construction; there is
too much of tha omnipresent hash about it. Jingles
and jangles of old times, fragments and fringes of
ancient airs are jumbled together in some parts, so that
one of a lively fancy like ourselves is liable to imagine
that the composer wrote it when he was poor, and had
to live on sheets of music which he could not digest.
But here and there are some original and charming
lyrics. We are of the school ot Mozart and Jacli
Delany, ourselves, and therefore are not naturally fond
of anything frivolous. Our musical education was not
like that of Our lady rivals, got by flattening onr spec-
tacled noses against shon-wiudows, or, like that of our
masculine oo-critios, gathered from the maudlin hiccup-
ing of some frowsy female who plays the piano in an
obscure cafe In fact, in a burst or confidence, we might
say that it was never obtained at all There is, to be
candid, no music for us like the sound of tho gong that
calls us to our midday hash.

Tha setting of the piece is certainly splendid.
Mr. Dunning may bo a email man physically, bnt in
matters of tasie he is a Titan. We should I'ke to have
written a lot of hoaey-lipped phrases about Miss Chard,
and, in fact, had partly composed an ode to her on the
evening of the performance, but which we regret to say
wa were not sober enough to finish Intoxicated by her
witching smile, of course. It is a pity, too. that we
lost that ode Wo have some sort of hazy reraember-
anca that we identified ourselves therein with Pindar, in
order to get in a rhyme to •* cinder," which we com-
pared our heart to at tho time, because it had been
•* charred" —a state of things which we, in the next
line, remarked was rough upon a “ bard." Miss
Ivanova, also, by tho way, wo had intended to say
something graceful and sweet about; but after a selec-
tion of assorted flowary phrases, wa have come to
the conclusion that wo can say nothing as graceful as
she looks and as sweet as she sings. Mr. Appleby, as
Don Brasioro, convinced ns—and wo flatter ourselves
wo have something of an eye tor humour—that he is an
artist, not a one-part actor. He is a most clever
comedian, and wo wish wo could show cur appreciation
of his talents in seme substantial way. Any time he
has any trouble about ft wig we will lend him onr hair.
This is all we can do, because we are poor.

thrilled us with her vocalization, she did not make our
souls flutter with her pathos. We can’t say more about

who are their fellow supes. This renders the artillery
careworn. As a matter of fact, the defenders of our
hearth* and homes are not the hardy warriors the out-
side public take them for. There is not enough of energy
to lift a linstock in any of them. They are mere
military moths which flatter round the candle of the
ballot. And this brings us to the fact that Mr Sol ution,
the libelled, was himself an artilleryman. Linklater
puts it thus:—"The sound (of bis being on the roof)
attracted the attention of a more tutu usually uudraptd
nymph, and a terrific scream announced to t he hapless
intruder that his dazzling shirt-front and glittering dia-
mond studs had been‘spotted.’ Vainly he stroveto make
his way to terra firma 1 Unnerved and gasping he hung
by a waterspout and finger tips, from which perilous
position ho was rescued by the stage manager and
property-man. But his troubles had only begun. The
enraged Dianas claimed their victim, and had him, too 1
They took him to their dressing-room, and, having
plentifully besprinkled him with dirty water, deftly ap-
plied their ready powder puffs, and when that unhappy
wight arrived at the paternal mansion, the old man
raised his eyes and his hands, and exclaimed—Holy
Moses I ish dat a ghost or a rolling-pin f . . . Now,
yon would hardly credit it, but this young gentleman is
a member of the Artillery Force of South Australia,
and he is just about to be promoted to the rank of com-
missioned officer, and to mix with gentlemen. Of
course, after the above narrative, every one will know
what fori" This is rather giddy "copy," of course,

that Solomon was (he man: and so he stands com-
mitted for trial. We don’t know whether Solomon
looked through the window at the girls, or whether he
didn’t If he didn’t, and is falsely accused of such a
feeble hankering after the horrible, Linklater ought to

A confession of polyandrySawyer.—10th
inat, at T (install, Eliza, the beloved wife of Edgar and
Charles Sawyer, in her 31st year.”
DRUNK.
“ So, sir, yon are drunk again I’’ she said.
The wife at Woolloomooloo,
When her husband came tottering homo to bed
Somewhere about half-past two.
•* Ish lie,” he replied to the little wife.
Who, in sooth, was rather a shrew,
“ I never was drunk in all my life—
Except when I married you."
“ Come closer to your own
Toodles,” said the gallant bride,
groom in a thrilled whisper,
wh ioh made itself heard all over
the poop; and, with a little grati-
fied sob of love, the bride end-
died np beside him. And having
thus established themselves as a
popular entertainment on board
the Wide Bay steamer, they
gave a series of performances.
First, they sneaked down into
the saloon, and had a good
squeeze behind the big ica-chest.
Next they came up and kissed
behind the funnel, and scuffled
in the companion hatch. All
the old ladies who had no hopes
of fntnre honeymoons sniffed,
and said it was shocking; while
all the gentlemen wanted to
punch "the confounded baboon s
head”—and kiss the babooness,
in his stead. But there was one
young lady who was filled with
sympathy. She sidled np, and
haunted the happy pair, and
squirmed when they squeezed.
At last, the bold bad bridegroom
recognised a sympathetic sonl,
and, inviting the charming
stranger to “ come along, estab-
lished himself recumbent on the
skylight with a lovely being on
each side—the bride and the
sympathiser —whom he kissed
and caressed, tarn about, with
a strict impartiality. Perhaps
it was the heat or the sea-air
which sent them all to sleep,
and afforded other passengers
opportunity of coming up in
groups and contemplating the
show, and betting that they
could pick out the right one’s
feet among the complicated
hunch of six, which peeped from
under the travelling tug.
AxTold [man who had wandered from the Liver-
pool Asylum down to Kiama was arrested there the
other day for smashing the courthouse windows with a
tomahawk because the magistrate did not at ones give
him' a pass for re-admission into tho Asylum. They
gave this “ desperate ;iconoclast,’* to uso tho lofty
language of tho local paper, two months. And tho case
of this poor old fellow reminds us that we were up at
the Asylum a short time ago, and saw the other old
fellows—wrecks left stranded by the ebbing tide of
years, relics of the royal past—walking up and down tho
yard, singly er by twos and throes, bent with the weight
of days, yet all with one thought in their eyes, which
seemed to transfigure the faded old faces and restore to
them the glery of youth again, and the thought was
«• is that long-haired stranger likely to have such a
thing as a plug of tobacco about him ?”
• • •
His manner was bland, and he wanted abont
*'tloe tousan pouns ’’ worth of goods. The merchant,
as good a fellow as ever lived, washed his hands un-
easily in air, and really felt it almost an outrage on so
mild and childlike a customer to hint that there was
already a little bill for £700 not matured, “which yon
know might as well—-That is, perhaps"—"Billee,
what billee P My billee, seven bundled ? All litee, all
litee; yon hold it? Me givea cheque. Me takee up
bille dileotly.” And the heathen actually gave a cheque,
then and there, with an easy indifference to such a
“tlifle,” as he called it, just flavoured with a glance of
mild upbraiding which occasioned the good-hearted
North-oountryman the deepest self-reproach. And tho
cheque was paid on presentation, and Ah Haw got deli-
vary of the £3000 worth of goods, and shortly filed his
schedule with as much calm alacrity as if he were an
esteemed member of the Pitt-streot chapel. And now
what that merchant chiefly wants in life, next to infor-
mation as to what became of the goods so quickly, is a
leprous Mongolian to nee as a street rammer.
Wo have read ao much about the Poatoffioe
carvings in the other journals, that we have given up
an intention we had of writing onr own theory about
them. The art critics of the Echo and the Evening
News have exhausted pretty nearly all the technical
terms in use in either eulogising or ridiculing them.
V'e have now no heart for either ridicule or eulogy.
Last week we went round to look at them with our own
avtist. We regretted to see that in his sketch he had
misinterpreted one of the figures: he made the Learned
Pig a Judge. We were ranch out up about this We
cherished one little ewe pig, and in a sketch we made
o irselves —we have an etch for etching—we sweetly
foreshortened it into the picture, and curled it up like
a fried meat-ball. This was at the Town Hall art
apotheosis. Well, the artist then made it an ordinary
p ; g, with ordinary trotters, and totally devoid of all the
little eccentricities of structure which so much en-
deared it to ns. We said nothing, however, though we
felt hurt. And just when we had got another pig to
take its place in our affections, we found this new one
turned into a judge! This was too much. However,
to ba critical, onr opinion certainly is that
if national sculptures should be something high
and ennobling, and representative of the na-
tion at its greatest and best, these relievi would
not materially assist the floating of a State loan if
photographs of them were sent home previous to patting
it upon the market. Also if, as our classical contem-
poraries say, Mr. Barnet has copied the method of
Phidias (poor old Phidias!) what will the arobmologists
of years to come, when even Barnet is forgotten, think
of the generation that furnished models for these
figures ? Probably they will put them down to products
of the aneioonio days. We got this word from a
University man who couldn’t spell, so we had to
exchange a pair of boots for a Greek dictionary with
a reporter who, happening to be | going North to edit a
paper, had bought one in some old;book store under the
impression that it was a glossary of aboriginal words.
Aneioonio then, dear reader, means without definite
form This is the earliest style of art. It might, in
fact be more popularly denominated as the dug-out
order The idea which these carvings will give to the
unlearned of future ages is too dreadful to contemplate.
They will, on seeing them, probably come to the con-
clusion that wo of the present age were thres-cornered
or pentagodal or rhomboid-shaped. But, as our con-
temporaries say. though we don’t see how they should
know it, truth is truth. By the way, this reminds us
that wo did not see anything distinctly representative
of the Press among these carvings, unless something in
a corner of one of the metopes (if this word isn t right
we can’t help it j we can’t waste any more of our time
groping in the toni-bs of dead languages, which
looked like a rum-bask, but might havo been a hat, was
intended to represent the Fourth Estate The church,
however, is symbolised by a little man in a broad squat
beaver who is evidently intended as the picture of a
parson collecting dues Tne expression upon the face
of the man he is addressing is intensely natural. Ha
holds something heavy in his hand which might be a
pocket-book, but looks much more like a brick, and
appears, as he looks contemplatively at the parson, to
be saying to a boy who stands beside him “Do you
think this is heavy enough to stun him, sonny?" We
consider this a fine stroke of art, and thoroughly true
to the feeling of the time. We are glad, also, to see
that poetry—which is now one of the staple products of
this country—is not left out in the cold. There is a
beautiful group purporting to depict the manufacture
of this useful article, about the seventh, if wo
remember rightly, from the Moore-street side. D. B
W. (and the rest) Sladen is shown sitting by
a table with his Apollonian head leaning upon his hand,
while one eye is cast musingly up to the corner of the
panel as if to catch inspiration from a small boy carved
up there with eyes and mouth smallpoxed into a face
like a batter pudding. Close by the bard is the printer,
ready with a yard stick to measure his lines. The man
who is waiting outside with a club to kill the bard, un-
fortunately cannot be got in, and this rather spoils the
general effect of the conception. Taken altogether, we
consider that these carvings are really high-class speci-
mens of the best school of Chinese art. And hero we
might remark that Mr. Barnet should follow the ex-
ample of our Daaialns—if Alfred will allow us to
infringe upon his classical preserves—who, having
erected something or other, probably a pie-shop, in
Memphis, set his own statue upon the premises. Mr.
Barnet should set his statue up near the scene of his
immortal triumphs. And if he will take a hint from us,
we would suggest that he should eet it up in a pit.
WOMAN ITEMS.
A lady writer, “ Athene, * talking of New York

wealthy and agreeable, polished and well-bred men
about town, the very class most valuable in the eyes of
mamas and chaperones, and most eligible for their
daughters, can’t be manoeuvred into the ballroom • and
mamas and chaperones are in despair. At parties ans
balls, their place is supplied by swarms of small, ptmv a
under-fed, ordinary-looking youths. Nobody seems

They appear to spring from the floor in hundred*

of their hour. Lovely girls are forced to accept their
sickly society, and put up with their penny pomposity
These creatures constitute the ball. Without them
the art of dancing would die—at least in New York At
the great Charity ball there were incredible numbers of
them, all of them small and weak-kneed, and looking
as if they all belonged to the same family. *
Tha good old reverence for the religion of one’s
fathers is dying out at a shocking rate do back a sin-
gle generation, and every ‘right-thinking’ Hindoo
widow, with a ‘ well-regulated mind,’ stepped with
reverential alacrity, stimulated by prescriptions of
‘ bhang ’ and tha prayers of the faithful, on to the
funeral pyra of her deceased husband, and in death
they wero not divided. Now-a-days, alasl heresy has
spread its hateful infection, and the ladies of the East
commence to assume un feminine and immodest habits
of surviving their hubbys, and even trample modesty
under foot to the extent of arguing that the former
ceremonial, endorsed though it was by the assent and
approval of ad that had been wise and virtuous among
mankind in Hindostan for a thousand years, was bosh
and contrary to the light of reason. The arrogant op*
position of unassisted reason to a faith venerable by
age, and dating back to the grand old days when con.
querors used to slay the male conquered without mercy'
by hundreds of thousands, with unflinching devotion to
the divine commands, and raliglou-ly catch hold of all
the virgins, begins to bear its inevitable fruits. A young
and lovely Hindoo widow (by putting it thus, wo mean
of course, to hint, without exactly saying so, that she
must be “no better than she should be’’) is about to
visit England on a lecturing tour. “ Woman’s Kights ”
furnish her subject. There is something inexpressibly
painful in this, to all disniplinad minds. But the widow

something inexpressibly painful in being burnt alive—

POLLY’S PICNIC.
A PATHETIC TALE.
[Under protest.— Ed. B.]
There is found a weird and wild spot, where reside a
ragged race,
It is by a Glebe Point fbus-stand, and is labelled
« Athlone Place.’*
There, within a three-room cottage, to which mangling
oft was sent,
Polly lived with her old mother, and her mother owed
the rent.
Polly was a loving daughter, whom her mother seldom
chid;
Seldom " mother” she bombarded with a brick or sauoo-
pan-lid.
If the neighbours said the bottles flew around sometimes
Uke hail,
Doubtless this, like many others, was a viciously-told
tale.
In appearance Poll was charming (it is on this the
story hangs) i
She wore high-heeled "number sixes”—with a candle
ourled her bangs.'
Even while she turned a mangle for a “ sprat ” in Ath-
lone Place,
Lo I the milkman he was stricken with her undulating
grace.
One day Polly said to "Mother." "Fading from my
cheek's the bloom—
Ah I no rush of salt-sea breezes ever penetrates this
room.
1 do nob reproach you, mother 5 everybody has their
faults 1
But, dear mother, when you hiccup, this seems like a
whisky vaults.
** Let mo wander where the salt sea laves the gold sand
with its foam;
Let me wander—oh, for one day--from this alcoholic
home I
Let me rest upon the green sward, gfcse up at the sky
so clear, f ,
Where, in llett, Ma, of your hiccup* I’U the ocean a
rhythm hear.” i
Qolden rose the dawn of Summer, scented 'was the
morning air,
As away went tripping Polly—freckled yet but passing
fair!
Light her heart, and light her footstep, as she gaily
tripped away—
Heavy was her hair with dripping, though her heart
was light that day.
Deep and solemn, grim and ghostly, there up-rose the
shades of night;
Sailed the moon through fleecy cloudlets, shedding
forth her mellow light j
And the mother turned the mangle, sipping, in turns,
beer and rum;
Yet, although the night grew older, lo 1 her Polly did
not come I
Down upon her lowly bolster that sad mother laid her
head
(Once she’d owned a real pillow—now’t was a chaff bag
instead I)
•• Woe’s come to the widder,” moaned she : *’ Polly’s in
the biller’s sunk—
Never more my child will beat mo with a copper-stick
when drunk.
•• Never more my darling daughter, who to love her beer
I taught,
Will do battle with her mother for the big share of the
quart.
I can see her in the moonlight, a bright halo round her
head.
Tossed about by sportive wavelets—the oold, cruel sea
her bed I”

Lo, the chimes of midnight thundered o’er the city calm
and still.
Chimes reverberating loudly through the night air
clear and obill;
Then a knock came at the portal where the widow-
woman dwelt,
And she, peering through a casement, saw a lantern and
a belt.
Then she shtfekcd aloud, and panting: " Constable, oh,
tell,’’ she said.
THEY WERE DEMONS, THE SYDNEY MEN; AND WEIGHED Oat 91b.

Worthless and full of stain—

The dull heartbreak of this.
Light unto darkness turned.
Bright happiness to woe;
High heart to ashes burned;
And throned hope laid low.

Empty thy quiver now.

At Brisbane criminal sittings nine absent jury-

two years, and another who was on his way out from
Europe, The bailiff-man came np smilingly as usual
with a declaration of personal service. The point at
which the court refuses to give credence to the officers
of the law has we hope at, last been reached. Any
allegation to the effect that a policeman has been
admitted to heaven for the purpose of serving a sub-
poena is a lie on the faoe of it. And if on the other hand
constable 91X nnblnshingly avers that he has served a
summons on a man in the other place, the court must
refuse to believe him. Many policemen have got them-
selves into hell, but none have ever come out again.

the case. I have now been beab ten months, during
which time I have had only one wedding, and no chris-
tenings whatever. Let us pray to-night for the better
future of this mission.” Now, here’s where the boom
comes in. Two days after that prayer went up, a doctor
came to see the parson's wife, and while walking up the

Trouble at Sydney Hospital. The committee,
after much haggling, decided that it was advisable to
appoint a responsible superintendent to the control of
the institution. At the same time, however, they
agreed to a saving clause which did not bind them of
necessity to oonter the appointment on a medical man.
Some of the honorary surgeons object to being in any
way under the control of a physician, and appear to be
apprehensive lest a highly qualified man should be
imported from England. Several intelligent members
of tho committee, on the other band, consider that the
appointment should not be vested in a layman, and that
a big hospital can only be properly conducted by an
experienced physician, who in extreme cases requiring
immediate operation conld aot with the resident
surgeons. When doctors quarrel—chaos 1

Giddiness is becoming very general in New
Z aland, if we may judge by the following extraordinary
advertisement, which appeared in one of the papers
over there: —“Wanted, by two men, a Female Com-
panion or Wife Have a comfortable home in separate
h iuses. Ages, 24 and 38 respectfully.” Then follow the
addresses. There is a lot of confusion crammed with
those few words. First, whose wife do they want ?
Secondly, how is she to live in two houses at the same
time ? Again, how aro they going to settle their shaies
in her ? Or, is it she who would live in a separate house ?
Also, why are they aged so-and-so “ respectfully” ? And
lastly, what in thunder do they mean by it all, anyhow P
Perhaps they aro both widowers, and both want to
marry again, but consider a whole wife is too much
happiness for one man. We suppose the next thing we
shall hear of will be wife-raffias at so much a head.
A curious story cornea from Melbourne of a
newly married pair who went down to Phillip Island
to spend their honeymoon. It appears tho bridegroom
had telegraphed to a hotelkeeper down there, asking if
rooms could be engaged. The reply was that they could,
but, in the excitement of getting married, the bride-
groom forgot to take any farther steps. When the
couple got down there, all the rooms in the hotel wore
fall. Finally, they were allowed to camp at a house
where three old maids lived, on the condition that the
bride should sleep on a soft in the kitchen and the bride-
groom in an old stable at the hick. A case almost as
bad as this occurred when we were in Adelaide. A
literary gentleman got married, and the wedding was
hilarioul in the extreme. His bride slept with her
mother that night, and he slept somewhere else. We
have too much esprit &c , to mention where, bnt he
was bailed out next morning.
Tbia reads so much like a Salvation Army yarn
that we feel we are risking our reputation for veracity
by telling it. Nevertheless, it is the essence of truth
itself. Mr. F. MTnnes’ Arab stallion, Gnngahleen, died
last week at Newton Boyd. Seven years ago there was
a jumping contest at the Queanbeyan Agricultural
Show, and a yonng man nameu Palmer, who had charge
of Gungnhleen, bet a pound he could take the horse
over a six-feet hurdle. Palmer was a splendid rider, but
the horse wasn't up to the contract, and the bystanders
begged Palmer to knock off. He replied: "No, I’ll
settle this bet even if I have to go to Gehenna to do it,”
and then he rushed at the fence once more. The
plucky Gnngahleen did his level best this time. For a
few seconds he seemed to balance on the top rail, and
then down he came with a crash on his doomed rider.
Palmer’s neok was broken by the fall alone, and the
pommel of the saddle literally stove his chest in. His
brother is now reckoned one of the best rough riders in
Queensland And they can ride up there.

The Australasian Medical Gazette, which

Here is a slab of Mr. R. A. Withers’ new
patriotic song Tho Noose calls it “pretty poetry.”
Wo say it is very pretty poetry, indeed :—
“ Five stars ever shine where tho Southern Cross
Bestrides the blue arch of night;
From sunset till dawn they may still be seen.
And we bless their constant light;
For they shine in the sky and they shine in the fl .g
That tells of our sunny strand.
May that flag still wave while the stars above
Shed light on our happy land ”
Brother Withers, a word in yonr car. In the first place,
the cross isn’t an arch at all, but a dome; and the five
stars don’t bestride it any more than John Davies or
Peter Campsell bestrides three-star. Doyousnppofe
tor an instant they’re the souls of five defunct sausage,
sellers straddling five livery-stable horses on a Sunday
jig-jog ? They are inside tho dome and plastered on to
it, jnso like Barnet's carvings are stuck on and built
into the Post-office Farther, we sometimes miss their
“ constant light ” for weeks together—sometimes it’s
onr fault, and sometimes the fault of the stars. Yon
say they “ shine in the sky.” Where else would you
wish them to shine? Lock here. Withers, dear boy.
The “ patriotic” business is a fizzle. When there’s no
danger ahead, none but daaoons and other old women,
talk or write of “patriotism ” When the dangi r ot nies
the respectable and level headed part of the community
act patriotically, and the deacons ",nd old women get ag
tar as they can down the wombat-holes.
Some time ago, a city man bought goods to tho
extent of £1000 from another dealer, and was requested
by the vendor to do him tho favonr of signing a pro-
missory note for the amount prior to the delivery of
tho goods, as he was pressed for money and had larg*
engagements. The buyer obligingly complied, and tho
seller having drawn out in his own hakdwiiting a bill
for £1000 or so, his friend at onoe attached his sign a
tnre. Several days afterwsrds, wben the goods came to
hand, the buyer, finding that they were not according
to sample, declined to take delivery, and demanded the
return of his bill or its equivalent. Whereupon tbss
se.ler sent back what the buyer innocently believed to
be the £1000 bill, with the signature torn off. Anyhow,
the buyer troubled no more about tho mat'er, until
one flno morning, four months afterwards, ho found a
£1000 bill charged against him by the back, and, on
making enquiries, discovered that this was the identical
bill given by him to the grateful friend whom be had
kirdiy accommodated. The seller, be ascertained
had, on receiving the £1000 bill, at once passed
it in for discount, and had, when asked for n
return of the £1000, simply drawn out a bogus bill, torn
the signature a pace off, and sent it down in place ©f the
genuine original. The case, if any law touches it, wag
one of larceny as a bailee, bnt as the money wag
promptly paid, tho affair did not, as it undoubtedly
should, have done, see light in a court of justice. A na
following is an additional proof how carel ul pepnlcshould
be in bill transactions A man who has the reputation
of not being particularly moral, remqikqd, on bearing
the foregoing little story, “that the rascally vendor
wasn’t half sharp enough. He could have swindled his
friend in a much more effectual manner by sending him
back a £1000 bill bearing a forged signature of the buyer
—after taking care, however, that such forged signature
was so heavily cancelled and scratched over in the same
ink as that in which it bad been written, that the buyer
wouldn’t have known his own signature,”

A lately dead gentleman, who while in the flesh

aim, with a will providing that, “ia the event of any

we suppose the respectable deceased held with
Mihomet that women, having no souls, can t be
damned: therefore, it is of no consequence what faKh
they belong to. We don't think there will be exactly a
dead set made by Catholic proselytisets for the heirs of

not worth a cent, to any church.
A Queensland paper says there ia a “ popular
delusion to the effect that one of the easiest things in

delusion doesn’t extend to Queensland journalism,

and write articles on the philosophy of politics the

snriptions in vegetables, hven we ourseives would not
dare this, though we have dared everything else —from
writing poems to making bricks.
Tne Melbourne Licensed Victuallers’

says:—“ About a year ago Mr, Jessel lost the sight of an
eye through the bursting of a soda-water botcle. The
shook to the system was so great that it may be said the
sufferer never fairly rallied from it.” We should think
»o. We have never seen a bottle of soda opened
without being shocked. In our usual generous manner
we present the friends of the deceased gentleman with
an epitaph for him as under
O Mr. Martin Jessel

Yet the last breath left his throttle
Through a soda-water bottle.
And they put him on a trestle.

Whenever the maiden smiled 1
And every day, as we passed that place.
We lifted our eyes aloft.
And our eyes met hers —snoh glorious eyes—•
Tender, and sweet, and soft.
We wrote her verses, in which we called
Her Chlci'-ef course the rhyme
To this was “ snowy "—and wound them np
With “Yours till the end of time.”
What did she do at the window there,
All day, without ever a stir ?
Did she twins sweet flowers in a garland fair.
Or play on a dulcimer ?
No, sirs, if you thought that aha did these things.
Like us, you’d be out of it clean :
She urns simply a trousers'-hand, and worked

“ Bigotry murder* religion to frighten fools with

A Salvation Army General, in London, who had

rather preach for a month than work (or a day."
At the last mooting of the Sunday Opening
Society in Melbourne, vigorous steps were initiated to
secure the opening of the Public Library, Museum, and
National Gallery. Dr. Bromby spoke in support, and
the Rev. Charles Strong said it was the general wish,
and the Society had right on their side. Ha should
certainly object to anyone interfering with his private
library or with the book* he might see fit to read on a
Sunday afternoon, and the same argument applied to
the public and their library.
The centennial of the organisation of the Metho-
dist Episcopal Church in America is to be celebrated
next Christmas. The other denominations are prepar-
ing—preparing bricks, or would be if it occurred out
here. It would bo a real treat to us to see the Orange-
men here getting ready for a Roman Catholic centen-
nial oc vice versa. If such a oslebration were not in
the too remote future, we should speculate all our spare
money in building material and hardware, and advertise
in the Protestant Standard. After which wo should
go and live in a cellar until the funerals were over.
An analysis of the offertory collections at All
Saints’ Anglican Church, Brisbane, gives the following
reunite for the year, and affords a pretty fair last of tho

go bang for their souls’ sake; and 11,372 were throe-
penny Anglicans. Who says orthodox religion is losing
its hold ? Eleven thousand three hundred and seventy,

A venerable clergyman of Boston, glanced round
on his very thinly-scattered congregation one recent
8u«day. and said he hoped that on next Sabbath there
would be more present, for he would then have occasion
to reveal a scandal which had long oppressed bis heart.
Next Hundny his church was absolutely packed, “Dear
friends," procseded tho minister, “ tho scandal I would
reveal is this : You will gather in this place in crowds
to hear mischievous gossip, but will not listen to the ex-
Donation of the inspiied Word. Now, ray children. I
otter ray resignation. I am going to Europe for six
months, and 1 shall pay my own expenses."
Tho bowls which are raised by fanatics when-
ever It is proposed te open a Public Library or School
of Arts in Sunday, and the holy horror simulated at the
idea of a deputy librarian or caretaker being required
to sMend on tho Sawbath day, have always been recog-
nibMnh the outcome either «f craziness or insincerity.
WljSK'it suits their own cranks, the unco guid can blink
sucnAonsiderations with perfect ind.ffarence. The
pranfiffpf the Salvation Army in London have neoeisi-
tatedTli consequence of tho rowdy opposition to their
marchings end processions offered by the bkeletoi
Army, over 300 policemen being deprived of the Sunday
holiday which otherwise they enjoy once a month. The
Salvationists are so bent upon saving their own souls
that they don’t care whether policemen are damned or
not.
Regarding a shining light of tho Salvation Army
n Ban Francisco, the correspondent of theN Z. Herald
tells the following yarn One of the crowd, the Rev.
Ur Cox, has signally distinguished himself of late. As
a reward for his holiness or his stump speaking (ho
being a Republican stumper) I know not_wluch. the
President gave him a position as pension a|»nt. Now.
t here was a blind man in our Alms House, who. through
his attornev (Aiken), h*d fought for his pensions for
fourteen years, and wm dually awarded tbe full amount,
7650 dollars, the pension agent, the Dr Cox, being
instructed to pay the money. He and the attorney,
who eventually came together as friends, went bo the
blind victim, and told him to “ fix himself up prepara-
tory to leaving his not very agreeable home. they
then took him to the office, where he signed for the
money, but Cox kindly volunteered to take care of the
cash for him, since he could not see to work for himself.
He himself took 1000 dollars for his trouble, gave
Aiken 2000 dollars, paid a lodging-house for old men
1500 dollars and took the residue, which he put into n
worthless mine, of which he is president, and the poor
old man is to-day in the same position he was before.
This is one of the workers in God’s vineyard—simply
tne duplicate of many more whoso records would nil a
volume 3 hero really appeals to bo more villainy worked
under tho cloak of religion than under any garment—
even a woman's seal-skin—and what wonder is it that,
looking these matters in the face, the people are drift-
ing into a state of atheism when they look upon the
pranks played by the men who call themselves the dis.
iples of the Lord.’*
The bonefioent results of Salvation Army work
have had no better example than that of the Rev.
Charleaworth of Clapham, and Ms daughter. A bright,
pluoky, handsome girl, of ladylike manners and °dnoa-
tlon, lured into the streets among the oanaille and the
filthy rabble 1 Gloated on by thtir lewd eyes, polluted by
sounds and scenes that will never leave her memory—
though her sad mania must sooner or later end; this is
one ef General Booth's methods of religion I The
World points out that however much sympathy may
be felt for Mr. Charlosworfh, ho should have expected
nothing else than this fall, and plainly tells him it is
his own fault. Ho allowed his daughter, at the age
when girls are most impressionable and excitable, to
consort with persons who make a travesty of the
spiritual life, and religion the laughing-stock of the
streets. Brought up in the atmosphere of Evangeli-
calism, with a vivid imagination and devotional nature,
she was just fitted for the influence of Booth to have a
fatal effect. “ No father has a right to complain if his
daughter, habituated to Ritualistic excess, is finally re-
oeived into the Church of Rome. Mr. Charjesworth
did everything that was in his power to precipitate the
crisis in his daughter's life that he deplores; by edu-
cating her in a creed that does not strengthen character,
that alternately elevates the emotions by ecstatic
dreams and depresses them by horriole forebodings,
that ignores the realities of existence, and that, if
logically carried oat, would render life impossible " In
any case, nothing can be gained by degrading religion
to the gutter, or making it a mere matter of momentary
excitement and frenzy.
No wonder the venerable section of the Wesleyan
ministers now in Conference at several places shako
their wise old heads at the signs of growing heresy in
the Church. The impious scepticism of the age has
reached even the pulpit. What is to be said of a young
Wesleyan minister in a New Zealand town getting up in
the pulpit of his church and informing his congregation
that the miracle of Joshua in making the sun and moon
stand still was easily explained away by his (the rev.
gentleman’s) discovery that the verses ia the book of
Joshua announcing the event were merely extracts from
the writings of an old Hebrew poet of the name of
Jasher, and were only intended to be understood as a
poetical rendering of the famous battle —that, in fact,
the sun and moon did not take the slightest notice of
Joshua’s command, even if such a command was ever
given ? And this young man who said suoh dreadful
things was probably educated in a pious home, and
knelt at his mother’s knee to learn his prayers, and lay
across it when he forgot them ; and now he has come to
this 1 And no lightning struck the church ; and, worst
of all, nobody teemed to be surprised that it didn’t.

In a breach of promise case tried in London
lately, the plaintiff “ demurelw replied to a question as to
when she lost her heart, by fixing the date on the 10bh
of the month, when she met the defendant, and on being
asked what presents she had received from him men-
tioned a chain, boots, stockings and gloves.” If we
could lose our heart in this fashion we should lose it
twice a week and hold an annual sale of the proceeds.
But when we fall in love wo usually have to keep the

all things into consideration, we prefer to being struck

Mr. Biggar, against whom, as everyone knows,
a verdict for £400 and costs was the other day given
for breach of promise, has been the victim of a most
heartless practical joke, the perpetrator ct which was
Mr. Harold Purniss, an artist and caricaturist, equally
well-known in England and America. Impressed bv
reading) the voluminous report of the cause ceUhrc
Hyland v. Biggar, which had, no doubt, atteccd his
mental equilibrium, Mr. Farrias addressed a letter to
the defendant, couched in the following terms: —*‘I
have long admired your political integrity, and sympa-
thise with you in y«ur present misfortune. I therefor#
take this opportunity of proving the same by handing
you a cheque for £100, as a testimony of my esteem and
sympathy." In the course of post Mr. Harold Purniss
received a reply from Mr J G Biggar, M.P , of which
the annexed is a copv' '* House of Commons, London,
12th March, 1883. Harold Purniss, Eeq. My dear Sir,
—Your letter, with very generous gift enclosed reached
me safely. I am ashamed to accept it and would not
have done so were it not that I have teen the victim of
a scandalous conspiracy, which has injured me without
benetitting the authors of it. I am dear sir. yours with
gratitude, Joseph O Bigvar ’’ Of course the joke was
that the funds of Mr. Harold Purniss in the hands of
tho bank on which the cheque was drawn did not amount
to -100 pence—in fact they wore absolutely nil.

Dr. Turner, of Melbourne Benevolent Asylum,
says ho has seen many sad spectacles, but never before
has he seen sunh a lot of wretches ns there are in his

rags.
Euahborne, who is to be hanged for murdering
the Chinese doctor at Armidale, appears to have been
an arrant hypocrite. During his residence in Armidale
he was a regular attendant at the Church of England,
and, when in Tam worth, the Sunday after he committed
the murder ha attended the Church of England in that

This year’s 8 A. harvest averaged only 4 bushels
13 lb, to the acre ; last year’s was only 21 lb. per acre
better. 1 7S'»,C00 acres were cropped. Despite the
wretched yield, S.A. will still have 3J millions of
bushels for export. And in spite of the fact that the
harvest in the Molong district has this year given an
average of 22J bushels, N.8.W. will still have to depend
upon S.A. for bread.
Thus the Pall Mall Gazette re Thakombau ;

piratical Viking. At heart we are fully half of us

Early on Thursday morning, a horse trainer got
out of a window about 20ft. high in Stanley-street, and
observed as ho was stepping down that he was “ Just

first thing that struck him after he left was the pave-

George Collins Levey (the f*. M. Herald, by
the way, sacrilegiously calls him "Levy 1”—writes fro™
Amsterdam, under date 21st March, to the effect tnat
the roof of the Exhibition Building was not then
finished, nor was the flooring laid. It was quite certain
that the exhibition could not be opened on the 1st of
May, as proposed. He expresses his dissatisfaction at
the system of management, and remarks tbas the Exhi-
bition ie a private speculation, which adds greatly to
the difficulties and anxieties of his position.
The Alta mine, Yam Creek, is turning out some
magnificent atone, being the richest specimens yet seen
In the Northern Territory. Another somewhat senfa-
tioual piece of mining news comes from Mount G» Brett,
35 miles from Herberton, where a continuous silver-lode
of enormous richness, 50ft. wide, situated beside a
never-failinsr creek, is said to have been discovered.
The Silver Valley Mining Co.’s manager at Silver Camp,
near Herberton, reports having bottomed the shaft oh
pure silver, and specimens which have been taken from
the walls of any part show thick pure metal.
The drum ecclesiastic is being beaten, and the
fiery eross carried round in Melbonrue. The heretical
trustees of the Public Library have resolved that the
Chronological Museum and galleries shall be opened to
the public on each Sunday during the month of May,
from 1 30 to 5 p.m. An amendment, to the effect that
the openimr be postponed till a fortnight after the
meeting of Parliament, was negatived. A sub-committee
was appointed to carry the resolution into effect, but
this cannot be done until the resolution of the trustees
is cob firmed by an order in Council.
Mary Ramsay, 18, was tried last week at
Bathurst for killing her illegitimate child with an axe,
A medical witness gave it as his opinion that the girl
was, at the time of the murder, suffering from “ impnl-
sire insanity.” *'Impulsive insanity,” we may explain,
is the kind of thing which, in the opinion of juries,
prompts people who are young and comely and interest-
ing to kill others. Milbra Nott, who knifed her lover,
suffered from “ impulsive insanity.” Bertrand also
suffered fnom a similar complaint, only the jury didn’t
think so. Impulsive Insanity generally goes hand in
hand with a carving-knife or an axe.
A man was committed last week for stealing
books from the Sydney School of Arts. One oan pity
the poor devil who has so little money that he is
tempted to steal a book for its own sake. But one can
hardly sympathise with the man who robs a public
institution of its books and pawns them. In the present
instance, the accused, who had been a member of the
institution for four years, had stolen at least £» worth
of books. Worse still, he had stolen the D.T’s dic-
tionary, thus inflicting a wrong on this long-suffering
community which oan only be avenged with his blood.
At Herberton (N.Q ) a Cornish miner attempted
to break into the post office where there are three
officials employed. His entrance was disputed by the
line-repairer, who was disposed of after the intruder had
broken the French light. The telegraph master, who at
the moment entered, and blandly asked what was the
matter, was answered by being plugged in the eye and
knocked against a two inch cedar board, which his head
smashed. Then the operator rushed in, and collared
the genial miner, who had the telegsaph man by the
throat. The Cornishman turned on his new assailant
(who is of the Spofforth order ©f architecture—6 ft.
nigh with a 22 in. chest) and made a terriflo hit at him.
but the operator escaped the blow by turning sideways,
the miner of course not being able to see him. Even-
tually the officials prevailed.
At Young, two men are going to law over a
grave. One of them, Johnston, some years ago
selected ground which he intended to be eight feet, the
size allowed for a family grave, but through remissnoss
on the part of trusties, he only paid the fee for an
ordinary interment Johnston has not since fenced the
ground, or in any way marked his boundary. In 1860 a
Mr. Fleming obtained the site for a family grave, and,
paying the proper fees, fenced it in and ornamented the
enclosure with flowers and shrubs. This ground, it is
alleged, encroached two feet on that claimed by John-
ston. Ths latter has torn up the flowers and pulled
down the fencing so far as he alleges It trespasses on
his ground. The cemetery has never been surveyed,
and no one knows who the trustees are. By the time
that Mr. Johnston has fought his case in court andfee’d
the lawyers, he will be ready to feed the worms, and
will be very lucky if he has about him the price of a
six-foot grave.
There was another anti-Chinese meeting on
the Wild River (N.Q.), the other night. It having
bon proposed that, ” We, the farmers residing
in the Tinaroo district, wish the miners and business
people of Herberton to oo operate with us to keep the
influx of Chinese out of the district,” Mr. Gwynne,
surveyor, moved this amendmentThat the miners
and residents of this district solemnly pledge them-
selves not to touch, taste, or handle the produce of any
Chinaman, nor employ them in any kind of labour
whatever.” The speaker remarked that, in the event
of the amendment being carried, he wou’d go to his
camp and pack off his Chineee cook right away ; but he
objected to the inconsistency of the men who, while
openly crying down Chinasaen for popularity’s sake,
secretly purchased John’s vegetables because they
were cheap. He (Mr. Gwynne) had employed
a Chinese, a Kanaka, and six Europeans. The
Kanaka was the best man of the lot, the Chinaman the
next, and the six whites where at that moment dead
drunk in his camp. If the meeting was prepared to
act consistently, all right; but if not, and anyone
dared to interfere with him or his servants on the
j anti-ChrnoBo racket, they’d have to be prepared to take
[ the consequences, tor be did not intend to be bullied.
Farther on. It came out that the local fawners, who had
oaHled on the miners to help them in expelling the
Chinese, were actually employing Mongolians to clear
their laud I
The success of the Technical College of the
School of Arts, Sydney, is perhaps unparalleled in the
bistory of such insiitutions. After y«-ars of persistent
exertion on the part of several scientific gentlemen, the
system of teohnieal education has been practically in.
trodnoed, and its development will in future bo the
history of that well-known institution. It will surprise
many to learn that the students now number over lioo,
and that almost every branch of science is represented
in the curriculum. The teachers, some of whom have
been selected for the highest posts in similar capacities
in the University, are more numerous than are usualfy
found in kindred institutions. Th »latest step taken by
the committee of management indicates further pro.
gross. The curriculum now embraces the science of
language and voice-building, which more than probably
any other study has been neglected in all English com-
munities. The services of Miss Lydia Hastings have
been secured, and as this lady is a pupil of Murdoch
and of Vandemhofi. the ablest exponents of the science
of language, something practical should be the result.
Miss Hastings’ services have heretofore been largely
availed of by ministers, barristers, lecturers, vocalists,
and others, who have realised the necessity of building
up the voice and then knowing how to use it. These
new departures from tbe old beaten path in the manage,
ment of the School of Arts indicate the triumph of
energy and practical common sense.

In reply to a correspondent who asks for infor-
mation : It was formerly held in England that a
marriage contracted under British law could not be
dissolved elsewhere. This, however, led to serious
difficulties, and the contrary was a few years ago
settled by a deciding case in the House of Lords. Qi-
vorces, therefore, obtained in America are valid now
throughout the British Empire.
In the matter of his criminal libel action against
the World, Lord Lonsdale, it is said, would prefer
accepting an apology bo the esolandre of public proceed-
ings, but the father of the lady who wrote the para-
graph, and whose name has, in the most cowardly
manner, been given up by Mr. Tates, declines every
description of compromise. The matter, it is thought,
will end very seriously.

The late Dr. John Aloysins Norbert Quirk was
52 years old, a native of Koscrea. Ireland, and became
a student here in St. Mary's Seminary about 18-13, the
present Attorney General being one of his class-fellow*.
He graduated at the University with honours in 1868,
was for 20 years a professor at St. Mary’s College,
Lyndhurst, and for some years President there. As a
skilful and thorough teacher, an enthusiastic scholar
and accomplished musician, a man of wide sympathies
and genial heart, “ Father Norbert” will be long re-
membered with respect.

Moorey was provided with a bed ten feet long, and the
cook used to call him in sections, having a shandy-gaff
and a spell between each part of his name. His visiting
card is about the size of the sheet that covers bis couch.
Whenever the telegraph people have to eommunioate
with their sable brother, they call for tenders for sub-
contracts and get the thing done by piece-work. One
advantage about Moorey’s name is nobody ever thinks
of summoning him for debt, as no ordinary mortal can
gat within the radius of a washing-tub of his name.
The last census enumerator who waited, on his lordship
died of a broken heart at bis father-in-law's spelling
bea. Now, however, Moocey .... has changed
his name to John Brown, and will be able to sleep the
sleep of the righteous, keep his visiting cards in a spare
boot instead of the fowl-house that formerly monopo-
lised this portion of his stationery, and look Normanton
folk in the f acj like a respectable member of society.
It is cheering to us, who are loyal spirits, to
learn that the Prince of Wales, who is already a Field
Marshal in the English Army (to its sublime glory),
has been appointed to a similar rank in the German
forces. Now, we know a good deal, about the Prince ot
Wales, and have always admired Mm. He is very fond
of British beer; and a man who is fond of good British
beer commends himself at once to our admiration. The
first thing he a sked bis doctor for when i ooovering from
coma in his bad attack was a tankard of Bass. Ever
since this we have greatly revered him, and would have
been quite content had he founded hie pretensions for a
Field Marshal’s baton on his power of concealing malt.
We don't know what he did really found it on, but be
got the rank, much to the amusement of the people
generally, and is now one of a band qf noble heroes who
are wheeled about in bath chairs, and who, if wheezing
at an enemy could in any way Injure him, would
soon devastate the universe. It appears that, pri° r
to being created a German Field Marshal, the Prince
was Colonel cf the Bluohor hussars. To the mess-room
of that regiment thointrepid commander has presented
his portrait, and, since it has been hung there, none ot
the (other) officers have ceased to smile. The Prince
has also presented to the Hussars now fair dolmans,
though it is not on record whether or not he has pre-
sented alto new laces to his Bluchers. We are peace-
able : but, if ever we g» to war with the Bum..we
should like H.fi.H. to be Field Marshal—on the other
side.
The researches of the party which went in quest
of poor young Clarke have left no doubt about bis
terrible fate. Killed and eaten by the blacks, poor lad.
Mr. Hungerford, on the discoveries by the search party
becoming known, called upon Harold Clarke, brother
of the murdered youth, and expressed hia deep sym-
pathy with Mr. Clarke, senior, and family. The elder
Mr. Clarke, who has been bereft of eon and wife, by tna
ona occurrence —Mrs. Clarke sank under the first tiding*
of her son’s abandonment and non-appearance—believes
that Mr. Hungerford did leave young Clarke in com-
paratively good health, and thinks the sequel boars out
Hungerford’s representations to that effect. -»
blames Huagerford’s lack of manliness or of foresight
in leaving the lad to hia fate, but, “ as a Christian man,
bears no malice to him " Hungerford’s pnnisbmen
will, he considers, be bitter, in having iso long asi n
lives to sustain the self-reproach of having, by delect
of humanity or common prudence, exposed a in®**
and companion to so tragic and shocking a t&te.
It is a singular fact that Mr. Clarke had a prevision ,
his son’s fate, in a dream. The sight before the nr*
telegram arrived announcing Walter Clarke’s mysteri-
ous disappearance, his father dreamed that a m»
brought a lot ot poles into his back yard, each P°
being as white as snow. Subsequently the man ia>
three dead bodies on the ground. In the dream, m-
Clarke stood looking on and witnessed the tearing away
of the viscera, and the countenance of the corpse s
mangled bore a striking resemblance to the features
his son, Walter. Mr. Clarke mentioned this extr-
ordinary dseam to his wife and daughtos, on rising# an
early the same morning he received the first iatimat-vu
that his boo was missing, in a telegram from a-WS* ’
ford.

In the Herald of Wednesday week, thefollow-
iag telag'am appeared :— "Judgment was delivered to-
day in the ease Bradlaugh v. Newdearate, in connection
with the former attempting to take his seat in Parlia-
mant without taking the oath. Mr. Nowdegate is con-
damned to pay the whole of the expenses." Is the
Herald aware that Mr. Bradlangh did take his seat
without taking the oath; and that he sat and voted for
gome five months ? If it is, why are we told that Brad-
laugh only “attempted" to do so? If not, why it’s
only another case of consistent ignorance.
The Age says the other colonies should readjust
their boundaries, and give Victoria sonm more territory.
This, it is contended, can be done by Victoria’s neigh-
hours without materially curtailing their own limits
N. 8. W. and S. A could concede territory in one
direction and extend their own boundaries in another.
8. A, which will sooner or later have to give up her
northern territory, oould compensate herself by
annexing some of Westsrn Australia, and without
rectification of boundaries. The chances of federation
are small, because Victoria, with bar smaller population
and smaller territory, could not compete with her
neighbours in tbe federal scheme.

With cosmopolitan zeal to burn ?

According to the amendments made by the
Legislative Council in the Licensing Aot, the man who
wants to buy a drink on Sunday in a publio-houae will
have to travel 2? miles for it. This the intelligent citizen
will be able to accomplish by living at Manly and going
on Sunday to Samdnngham. In anticipation of the
amendments becoming law at an early date, 11 clubs ”
are being formed by several innkeepers whose houses,
being situated in somewhat out-of-the-way places, de-
pend for support rather on the steady patronage of
regular visitors than on the casual custom of the public
at large. The 20-mile clause shuts up Manly, and like-
wise puts the pious publicans of Parramatta “ clean out
of It.’’ By the way, Sunday travelling will now bo
practically prohibited in N.SW. Publicans who are
precluded from supplying drink aren’t by any means
likely to trouble themselves about finding food for man
and beast.
As Archbishop Croke of Cashel, has been
snmnoned by the Pope to Borne to confer respesting
the situation in Ireland, the following, from a letter
writtea by the Archbishop, on tne 3rd February last,
wi 1 afford some hint &i to the story the Pope will
bear:—"As an Irishman I feel almost humbled to the

That is to say, we the people of Forbes, alias H. H.
Cooke and T. Bodel, politicians out of luck. H. H
Cooke’s man “ Bohemian ; " the Rev. A. A. Aspinall,
chaplain of the Orange Lodge; the Rev. E. Dunstan,
another 12fch of July reviver; Croft and Burne, attor-
neys; the town bellman and bis ton; B. Cotton, lay-
preaoher and sheep-tender; J. L. Waugh, commission
agent and political aspirant. None of these bad taken
the trouble to hear Rsdmond Their minds had been
made up, yon see. The difference between them and
those who did go to hoar what Eedmond had to say
was, that the latter had to take more trouble to make
up their minds. Probably because they had more to
make up, and so had a bigger job.
During the last few weeks there have been
two teparato items of intelligence cabled to Australia,
between whioh probably few people have had tho fancy
to establish any connection. The first item was that
the Russians are concentrating an army on tho Ar-
meaiau frontier. The second was that the British
Government has formally addressed a remonstrance to
tho Porte on the subject of misgovernment in Armenia.
Ne wonder whether it has occurred to anyone that we
shall ere long have a cablegram announcing that the
Russian forces have entered Armenia with the object of
"saving the country from anarchy” and “initiating
the people in <he art of self-government.” That’s why
we invaded Egypt, and we are not out of Egypt yet.
Russia cordially approved. Now, why shouldn't Russia
invade Armenia on identical pretences—and remain
there P Then England might cordially approve too. It
doesn’t matter about the Egyptians and Armenians, of
course. Then Austria oould invade Macedonia *’ to
save the country from anarchy and initiate the people,
&3 ," and Busi-ia and England could do the approving.
And if Tub Bulletin were offensive enough to refuse
to join in a chorus of Jingo exultation every time,
and were to coldly insist that such proceedings
were immoral and excused on false pretence of
transparent hypoorisv, there is no reason why a
nice loud howl should be got up that The Bulletin is
run by Egyptians, or Armenians, or Macedonians, or
Tnrks, and <s unpatriotic and altogether horrid. Well,
we arc hard to please. Steal Egypt on false pretences,
and we obstinately refuse to be proud of our country
Burglarize Armenia, and we are insensible to the noble
motives whioh actuate, & 3. Annex Macedonia, still we
sneer at the Right Rev. the Primate (of Austria of
course) when he blesses tho banners of the filibustering
army and invoke? the Almighty to help that along and
paralyse the efforts of the rascally natives who object
to being despoiled. Turn Ireland into a Poland, and
irritate its people till they turn Nihilists, still wo won’t
enthuse. Oh, we’re a bad loti A hard l->t I Wo
viciously stick to it that tho principles of justice and
liberty are of universal application; that they aro of
Divine origin, and cannot, like the principles of the
proverbial politician, be altered to suit, whether it be
irreligious prejudioes or racial antipathies whioh it is
desired to adjust them to.
We suppose everyone remembers the prodigious
pother raised, just before the bombardment of Alex-
andria, about the audacity and obduracy of the Egyp-
tians in constructing new batteries to resist our
diet. As a matter of fact, it will be remembered that
the excuse given for commencing the bombardment
was that these batteries were being raised. A perfect
farore of spurious national sentiment was worked up
about this, and the cablegrams received in Australia
dealt with little except the batteries and the frightful
iniqnit'.BS of Arabi. Every morning the readers of the
S. M. Herald wore favoured with a highly-coloured
rendering of the subject-matter of the cablegrams, and
with incitements to hate the monster, Arabi, as tho
latest substitute for that hete noir of our forefathers,
the *• Corsican ogre ” Bonaparte. We remarked at the
time that it would be wise to temper excitement—to
discount tho cable messages, as they were obviously tho
echoes of an artificially worked-up turmoil, and might
convey a very modified impression were they con-
trasted with cablegrams from Egyptian sources. Well,
now that excitement has cooled down, and opportunity
is afforded for getting at tho facts on both sides, and
people are content to hear truth instead of being fran-
tically greedy for corroboration of their most inflamed
prejudices, as drunkards crave for another glass
of the stuff whioh has already upset their facial-
ties, it turns out that there were no new batteries
constructed at all. Mr, Seymour Keiy has
written to the London Echo, of February 17th
He is convinced by an inspection of the ruined forts
that no new batteries or new guns were added by Arabi,
and that the only work done was ‘ in the Fort of Ros-el-
Tin, where tho old stone parapets on two of the batteries
have been covered with sand abont four feet deep in
order to give better protection to the gunners.* The
Arabs, says Mr. Keay, cannot conceal their anxiety as
they ask ‘ When do yon think the British soldiers will
be withdrawn ?’ Not can they hide the glow of enthu-
siasm on their brows when you tell them that possibly
the English nation may sanotlon Arabi’s return,"
Sanction Arabi’s return 1 Good gracious, has it come
to this? The idea is preposterous. Her Majesty’s
Government would never do such a thing, especially
when they consider how it would hurt the feelings of the
Jingo writers on the S, M. Herald. It ia bad enough
already that events should have proved the Herald
wrong and The Bulletin right about Arabi being truly
the representative of tbe Egyptian people. If this sirt
of thing goes much further, people will begin to con-
eider whether it may not happen that whoa the excite-
ment of the hour has pas sad away it will equally appear
that the Herald is wrong and The Bulletin right
abont the resnonribility of the Land League leaders for
the Phoenix Park assassinations.
Some inkling of what Sir Thomas M’llwraith
contemplated in connection with Now Guinea appears
to have been conveyed to the Cooktown Herald several
months before tbe actual annexation. At any rate that
j carnal published a leader on January 31st, which, in
view of the event, certainly carries an appearance of in-
spiration. After pointing to the restlessness of France
in relation to Tonquin, the Congo, and Madagascar, and
commenting on tne apathy of the Gladstone Cabinet
with respect to New Guima, tho Cooktown paper con-
tinued :—"The relations between the republic and tho
court of St. James are not so cordial at present, either
on the Egyptian, the Madagascar, or the Tonquin sub-
jacts that we can afford to regard unconcernedly the
probability of a French colony and arsenal so near our
shores, and the best way to prevent it would be for the
whole of the Australian Governments to combine in
pointing out to the Home authorities the necessity for
annexing the magnificent island either to Queensland
or to the British Grown. There is nothing to prevent
it from becoming in a few years a colony far wealthier
and more prosperous than Fiji or Western Australia,
while there is a probability that rich mineral discoveries
would soon place it in advance of some of tho older
colonies. Russia now possesses a flue collection of the
products and minerals of Papua, and Baron Maklay’s
book, shortly to be published under tbe direct patronage
of the Czir, ia sure to stimulate interest iu Now
Guinea. The dream of an Oceanio colony still filters
through the brains of Italian statesmen, whose interest
in all that cor cerns New Guinea, has been fed by the
published volumes of their Venetian traveller and
naturalist. Fired with jealousy of tha North Borneo
Company, the Dutch merchants of Batavia and
Hamburg are urging tho Netherlands Government to
grant a charter to a New Guinea Company, not only
conveying the State territory for a consideration, but
promising protection and assistance for the acquisition
of the whole Island. Then we have the German
Colonization Co., started at Lubeok, having for its oh-
jaot the purchase of the Dutch portion of Papua, and
the formation of a German colony. Of these the Ger-
man settlement would be the least dangerous to Aus-
tralia, because their industrious and law abiding habits
make Teutons good colonists, aud more readily assimi-
late them with British institutions and the Anglo-Saxon
race ; but the fact Is that we cannot afford to allow any
foreign power to settle down so close as to menace our
borders, and dominate over our mercantile marine. If
Mr Kimbct and his Syndicate would but float a New
Guinea Colonization Co., on tho lines of tho North
Borneo, they would find a ready outlet for their spare
millions, and would assist in adding anothtr bright
jewel to the Tiara of the future Empress of Australia."
vVe have an idea that there is more in tha Syndicate
hint than lies on the surface.

God with a little "g.” His atheism is as notorious as

The committee of the Drapers’ Association are
vigorously driving in the wedge of reform with cc mmon-
sense knocks. At their last meeting, early closing was
the great theme, and all the employers are invited to
consider it at a conference on 10‘h May. The argu-
ments for six o’clock clesing are, chiefly, that it would
not diminish trade, expenses would be avoided, morality
and health of assistants encouraged, and that it is
neither in accordance with humanity nor necessity to
keep the terribly long hours now ao common.
Tha Sydney School of Anatomy wants bodies
for dissection, and is trying to raid the Fydney hospital.
Some of the committee seem to think that n knowledge
of the fact that unclaimed bodies are handed over for
dissection would prejudice the public against the insti-

by the friends of its deceased owner after the mortal
remains of the latter have been cut up, and that then
there will be diffionlty. There really ought not to be
much trouble in procuring subjects for dissection

There has been no sensation for some years in
clerical circles in Sydney like that caused by tbe Eev.
John Osborne, at the York.street Wes'eyan Centenary
Church, iu his speech on Archbishop Vaughan and the
K.C Church. The-Eov. Mr. Osborne is the gentleman
who has been dealing very ably, but mistakenly, with
the Irish question at Newcastle. Prieet-like, he was
for the landlords, and extremely Conservative, and wc
pointed out to him at the time that the clerio. was con-
sistently not the man to settle a political diflieulty. To
turn up in Sydney, and eulogise Dr. Vaughan and the
E C. Church was a surprise all round. In religious
matters, however, it appears Mr. Osborne is destined
to be the colonial Spurgeon or Beecher. Ha is the
straightest talker in any of the pulpits, and he has
definitely announced that his mission isfor the middle
class, and, whether he remains with the Wesleyan
Church or not, he will carry it on. Tbe York-sireet
Wesleyan Church has been desened for years—it is
damp for want of human habitation. Mr. Osborne
introduced good music, which increased Iho attend-
ance three fold, and his address on the Eoman
Catholic Church brought the vastest crowd ever
seen in the old chapel. Before he was half
through—when he had only bad time to put
the good points and not the defects erf the E C. institu-
tion before his hearers—fully 200 people rose and left
en masse, exhibiting every sign of dissatisfaction. They
had come with open maws for abuse, and could not
understand the style of argument of the rev. gentleman
Those who remained, of course, heard both side s of the
question. When the Eev. Mr, Osborne came out of
the Church there were several small knots of malcon-
tents discussing his address, and it is stated that both
Mr. Osborne and his wife ran some risk of personal
affront. The subject of the address is being fully dis-
cussed, and Mr. Osborne’s occupancy of the pulpit is a
matter of question. His position iq the city, however,
is no matter of question. He has earned for himself
a name for outspokenness and liberality. To the Free-
thought section of the community it must he perfectly
astounding to have one minister of Christ praising
another of the cloth. It looks much like what
Christianity is said to be.

Nowhere perhaps has the dentist's art obtained snob
high excellence as in Sydney. Certainly we are in no
sense behind any other city. Visitors to Sydney might-
to test this, visit the establishment of Messrs. Adolphe
Gabriel and Company, 18, Wynward Square, two doors
from Pfahlerfs Hotel. Here the manufacture of every
essential in the profession is carried on. At the rear of
the surgery is a compact little factory where all thf
requisites for supplying every dental defect in the
human mouth are made. Messrs. Gabriel and Co.
(whose enly address is as above) are always pleased to
show their specimens of artificial teeth to those
interested. There being two firms of the same name in
the Square, patients will oblige by paying particular
attention to the Christian name, Adolphe, and the num-
ber, 18, 2 doors from Pfahlerfs Hotel.—Advt.

Do you know why Lord Gussy was at the boat-

was there because he thought there might bo a fowl

where, and discovering that it was not a new sort of
sardine-opener, swopped it with us for a sausage-roll.

In a football match played at Glasgow, Sheffield
v. a local team, the goal-keeping of Ulyett, tbe crack
Yorkshire cricketer, was one of the features in the
game. Shot after shot from the busy feet of the
Glasgow forwards came to him thick and fast, but he
caught the ball like a sure-banded man behind the
wickets, and shied it back. On one occasion he saved
the leather (rom going under the goal by heading it out
when a crowd of his opponents were attempting to
charge him thaough. At the close of the contest he
was loudly cheered by the spectators on making his way
to the Pavilion.

The two miles’ walking match between J.
Ormes and W. M'Laren, for £20, came off in the
Domain on Saturday afternoon in rather an unsatisfac-
tory manner. M’Laren at first refused to walk, bat
upon Orme stating he would walk over and claim the
stakes, he sent for his walking togs, which were so long
coming that Orme walked over. Upon the arrival of
the clothes, however, he very (airly consented to walk
M'Laren (or the stakes. The men walked shoulder to
shoulder for about a quarter of a mile, when M’Laren
went ahead, but he was unable to keep his advantage,
as Orme spurted and passed him, and eventually won by
a hundred yards.
An effort is being made in England to get the
Eton and Harrow match played at Sandown Park
instead of at Lord’s. The masters and parents are
greatly in favour of such an arrangement, as “ Eton
and Harrow at Lord’s" has degenerated into a huge
saturnalian picnic. The executive at Sandown. with
this view, are willing to make their orioket ground
second to none in England; and, in fact, they purpose
creating at Sandown a splendid athletic ground!, with a
magnifiesnt cinder track, so that the place may be used
by members for all kinds of sports on non-racing days.
The 150 yards’ footrace between Mat. Jones, of
the Wollombi, and Alcorn, of Jerry's Plains, for £50,
came off on the Singleton racecourse at 5 on 23rd ultimo,
in the presence oi a large concourse of spectators.
Jones was the favourite in the betting, and at starting
12 to 10 was offered, but no money was to be got by
Jones’ backers at that price. Alcorn looked as if over-
trained, but Jones was in the pink of condition. Jonss
took tbe lead at tbe start, was never caught, and won
easily by two yards. Time, 15$ secs.
The protest against the three-year-old Fear
naught, who came in first for the Maiden Steeplechase
at the Warrnambool (Vie.) meeting, has been uphold,
as Buie 33 of the Grand National Regulations states
that: “ No horse shall be allowed to run under four
years of age tor a steeplechase, ner for a hurdle race until
the 1st of September of the year in which he is three
years old.” Wardanee takes tbe stakes, but no bets are
payable about Fearnaught, who was entered explicitly as
a three-year-old. but the stewards not finding any weight
specified for that age, allowed the horse to start on the
four-year-old scale, and ware not aware of their error
till the protest was entered.

2; G. Irish, 260yds, 3. Newman, 440yds, and Wag-
goner, 5C0yds, also started. Previous to starting
the event the rain came down very hard, and
continued daring the race. Thorley, whose handi-
cap brought him in the same line as Bolfe, though
with one lap to the good, stuck to the back wheel of the
veteran for five laps before the latter could shake him
off. In the second lap Bolfe caught up to Irish, the
pair racing neck and neck for three miles, passing New-
man and Waggoner. Bolfe and Irish, still racing close
to one another, then began to gain upon Thorley, but
the handicap allowed him was too great, (or he con-
tinued to maintain a strong lead, eventually winning by
100 yards, Bolfe second, and Irish a good third. Time,
17min.
The Intercolonial Eight-oar race on Saturday
last needs very little description. The Sydney men
started in good form, but the visitors indulged in some
splashing (or a few strokes, when they settled down,
and Upward setting them a splendid stroke they
obtained a lead of (ally half a length before a couple of
hundred yards bad been covered, both crews pulling 43
a minute. Sydney then quickened up to 46, and seemed
to hold their own (or a short distance, but the strain
was too great to last, and at the mile point, which was
shot by the Victorians in 5 min. 20 sec., Sydney had
slowed down to 38 to their opponents 4 ), with a gap of
two lengths deviding tbe boats. The Melburnians
kept on increasing their lead at will, and off the Sydney
Bowing Club Branch the Sydneyites became completely
demoralised. No. 4 came off his slide, and No. 5, in
looking round to see the cause of the stoppage, caught
a erab. However, they pulled themselves together, and
rowed on to the judge’s boat, waich was passed by the
Victorians with a ten lengths lead in IS min. 12 sec. Toe
arrangements for tbe accommodation of the Press were,
as usual, simply awful.
The (rreat undertaking set Master Charles
Brown (alias Young Nimrod), a little boy only in his
ninth year, to break 420 glass- balls, in double shots, out
of 600, was brought to a conclusion on a reoent evening,
at the Agricultural Hall, London, in the presence of a
numerous company. The little wonder, who need his
pretty 28-bore gun with great dexterity, easily accom-
plished the task set him by scoring 513 doable rises, or
93 over the alloted number. The most extraordinary
part of the performance was that in no single instance
did the youngster miss with both barrels, and of the
1200 shot at he broke 1113. Twice during the trial ha
broke 46 balls in succession, and on one afternoon
he broke 52 consecutively. It is very questionable it any
man, even Carver, under similar conditions, with each a
miniature gun and mites of cartridges, with It drams of
powder, and $ of an ounce of shot, could accomplish such
a feat. When Nimrod had concluded, ho was presented
with a handsome gold medal by his admirers, which will
be added to Prince Christian's beautiful present, and
numerous other trophies.
W. Edwards, who is now tripping it merrily at
the Exhibition Building, writes the following letter to
the Melbourne Sportsman “ In reply to J. Raynor,
the self styled • champion runner and walker,’ C. Swan,
and all other aspiring athletes. I wish to inform them
once and for all that from this out I will neither reply
to, nor in any way notice, any challenges unless accom-
panied by a deposit of £50. I am alwavs prepared to
meet anyone in a six days’ walk for £200 or upwards.
By inserting the above you will possibly be the means
of preventing me from being pestered by challenges
from all sorts of people, who have not the least inten-
tion of making a match, but by getting their challenges
inserted in your widely-circulated journal thereby
obtain a certain amount of cheap notoriety. Mr. Ray-
nor’s proposition to bo allowed to walk on the same
track as Mr. O'Leary and myself during the forthcom-
ing match is too ridiculous te need any r«ply.—I remain,
sir, yours etc., William Edwards.” Edwards would
indeed be a simple-minded creature were he to allow a
third party to force the pace and make things uncom-
fortable.
Mr. Eeilly, the owner of Snowflight, apparently
smarting under the cruel luck of getting slipped for the
Waterloo cup decider amongst rushes aud bog, has
issued a challenge to run any greyhound in the world
with Snowflight for £1000 to £5000, and ha would like
to stake £2000 to £1000 on her against her conqueror.
Wild Mint. Apparently the Wild Mint people are
quite satisfied with the flaky result, and do not care to
risk a second encounter, which would bo regarded a real
good thing for Snowflight by the majority of coursing
men. Her success in the final was neither more nor
loss than a fluke, that came of a most thoughtless and
culpable blunder on the part of the executive. The two
dogs were retained in slips half an hour while a number
of hares were racing about all round. Surprise and dis-
gust, too, was excited on all hands when it was observed
that no blind had been provided for the slipper. Both
dogs were frantic with excitement, Snowflight more es-
pecially. When slipped into the rush-bed Wild Mint
was unsighted for several strides, bnt, strange as it may
appear, this very result gave her the victory, cmow-
flight got decidedly best away, and reached her hare
just after flying a drain, some six lengths in front of
Wild Mint, to whose side puss shot, when Snowflight,
having overshot her game in jumping the drain, failed
to come round in possession. Wi d Mint then wrenched
a weak-rnnning, dodging hare twice, and gripped her,
but failed to hold, while puss straggled on in front of
the fawn half a dozen yards till she moved her twice,
and then picked her np,
Pierpoint, alias Van Prey, the bookmaker who
so suddenly and unceremoniously departed from Vic-
toria, “played it up ”en route to Europe vii N Z. and
’Frisco. In the Auckland Herald we read“ Yester-
day may be put down as a red-letter day for the Auck-
land bookmakers, in consequence of the presence in
this city of Mr. F. A. Pierpoint, one ef the most pro-
minent bookmakers from Victoria. Our local members
of the ‘ Ring * drove Mr. Pierpoint out to the grounds
of the Auckland Stud Company, and under the kind
guidance of Major Walmsley, Mr. Pierpoint was shown
over the ground, and his opinion of the resources of
the company and their stock is most flattering. After
spending a meet pleasant and profitable day at the stud
company’s grounds, the party returned to town, and in
the evening, by invitation from Mr. Pierpoint, the
Auckland bookmakers assembled to a champagne
supper. After the good things provided had been fully
discussed, Mr. Jas. Poole rose, and asked all present to
fill their glasses, and in a most appropriate and neat
speech proposed the health of their host, and also on
behalf of the Auckland ’Ring* wished Mr. and Mrs.
Pierpoint a most pleasant passage to San Francisco.
The toast was drunk with three times three. Mr.
Pierpoint, in responding, spoke feelingly of the hearty
manner in which both his own and Mrs. Fierpoint’s
health had been drunk, and expressed himself as highly
pleased with all that he had seen that day. He con-
sidered that with the material Auckland had in its
blood stock, it would soon make such a name for itself
as would be felt all through the Australasian colonies.
In conclusion, he asked those present to drink with him
to the health of the Auckland bookmakers, whose name
he said for straight, henest dealing was well known
throughout Australia.” What a consummate—gentle-
man this Van Prey, alias Pierpoint, must be.
New South Wales got an undeniably sound and
well-merited thrashing in the Intercolonial Eight-oar
race on Saturday last. Sydney, when compared with
Melbourne, has bnt few amateur oarsmen—and most of
her oarsmen are mere scullers. Sydney men have, of
late years, been satisfied with the glory reflected on
them by the Layoocks and Tricketts of the professional
sculling world—they have stuck to sailing and sculling
and have pretty well let eight-oar, four-oar, and pair-oar
rowing slide. Notwithstanding all the blow about our
beautiful harbour, wa haven’t so convenient a training
course as that little willow-fringed mud-pool, the much-
despised Upper Yarra; and, when we want to row, we
have either to take our luck on the steamer-infested
and comparatively rough water of the harbour, or go a
few miles out of town—to the Parramatta River. In
Melbourne, rowing men, when business is over, saunter
down the street, cross Prince's Bridge, and there they
are on the landing-stage, with boats all ready, and a
(say) four miles of beautifully smooth water l>etore
them, with not a steamer to bar the way or ruflflo the
river. We have managed to beat Melbourne, but, when
we have done so, it has, perhaps, been in a rather
inglorious kind of fashion—the water may have bee a
rough, and the Victorians, who aim at scientific and
pretty oarsmanship, lost themselves in the turbulent
water, leaving us to bullock through by main strength
rather than by the polished rowing, in smooth water,
which alone is worth going a mile to see. We can’t
bring the Parramatta River to Sydney, so if wo want to
beat Melbourne—and we have lota of men who are much
bigger and just as tough as the members of the pre-
sent crew of thq sister colony—we shall have to
go and practise on the Parramatta, even though it
be a few miles away from our usual haunts. In Sydney
you can now get together exactly one eight-oar crew—
that of the S.R.C. How long is it since two trained
club eights met in friendly rivalry in Sydney? How
many trophies have been presented for competition by
eights without eliciting a double response ? Then we
have a feeling abroad that there is a good deal of
oliqueism in regard to the selection of representative
N.S.W. crews—that the S.R.C. is now regarded by the
powers that be as the be-all and end-all of intercolonial
rowing affairs. Hava the various clubs been scoured
for big or even moderate-sized men ? That such a light
crew as that which purported to represent us on Satur-
day should put in an appearance on our behalf, at first
blush looks very badly for the physique of our rowing
men. But, after all, this year's N.S. W. crew affords no
criterion of our powers. We have many strapping
young fellows belonging to clubs other than the S.R.C.,
who only needed licking into shape, but who were left
out of a team which, with the exception of Brodio and
Bros, had perhaps scarcely a single man in it fit to take
a seat in a representative sight. The form in which the
Sydney men did their preliminary spin proved Mr.
Oatley to bo an excellent coach, and—by themselves—
the crew seemed to get good pace out of their boat.
Directly, hewever, the race commenced, our represen-
tatives’ comparative want of weight and power told its
sad tale; for the “ gum-suckers,” who appeared to
lift their boat out of the water at every stroke,
soon left their lighter opponents hopelessly
behind. We have had several lessons. Out of six races,
Melbourne has won four, and we but two. When shall
we commence to learn? This year the responsible
authorities made an execrable mess in selecting a boat.
They failed just as lamentably in selecting a crew;
about six people, some of them utterly unknown, turned
up at Redferu to represent the might and majesty of
N.S.W. aquatics on the arrival of the Victorians, who,
as previously stated, were, instead of being driven to
their hotel, according to the convenances of white men,
compelled to await the arrival of a twopenny tram. We
like to " rub in ” these things. However, the Victorians
have now had their revenge. They have drubbed us, c r
rather they have drubbed our system. We hope that
when our next year’s crow reaches Melbourne, they’d
not find eight Melbourne and Civil Service Rowing
Clubs* boys, each armed with a hand-barrow, or a
hearse, or a ’bus-ticket, waiting to ooudnot them to
Soott’s or the Union Club.

SOCIAL.
The Sunday picnic to tha Avenue, under the
auspices of tha Liberal Association, was a large affair.
Considerably over a thousand must have been present
during tha day, and it was in every way decorous. Most
of the visitors had evidently come to enjoy a quiet trip,
splendid weather, pretty scenery, and the converse of
kindred spirits. Every second man on tha steamers
down seemed to be reading the Liiibral, of which there
was a great sale, or Bradlaiuih's Case from the Christian
View, or some equally absorbing literature. And on
arrival at the grounds more vendors of these “ad vanned *
prints were met, eager to enlighten any stray individuals
who might be yet lingering in the gloom of benighted
orthodoxy. A wag’s demand for “ two copies of the
War Cry'’ was met by derision and scorn from the
sailers of IngeraolTs naughty tracts. The picnic scone
was like a beehive. In the pavilion were the band and
crowds of controversialists and chatterers, and oa the
flat were the games of crisket, lawn-tennis, rounders,
croquet, &3, all iu full play. Some tried fishing, or
leap-frog, soma went off in pairs or parties, and took a
long tour round the leafy lanes and pretty environs of
Hunter's Hill. A refreshment “ caboose” provided for
thorn who “ felt an hungered," but manv of the early
comers had brought the family baskets full of the uiual
home-made mysteries. And, later on, a few "dead
murines” of the Tenuent or Guinness brand showed
the good reunite of the Licensing Aot in making people
provident—on Saturday night. Over the hill, however,
some found their way to the Fig Tree, and having, by
tacking a suburb or two on to the voyage from Sydney,
constituted themselves “ travellers," boldly walked in
and legally abated their dronth; a uniformed constable
meanwhile pacing up and down outside, and vainly
endeavouring to tell by looking at persons* faces how
far they had travelled, while painfully conscious that
everyone was laughing at him. The most enjoyable
part of the picnic was certainly the exquisite playing of
Kaster’s combination band, numbering twelve, and
amongst them some of the beat musicians in Sydney.
Classical and sacred music of the finest obaraoter was
beautifully rendered, and solos on the trombone,
clarionet, and ’oollo were given. Some young people
evidenced a desire to dance on the floor, but the firmly
polite arguments of the committee convinced these
enthusiastic young ladies and gentlemen that to per-
sist in indulging that desire would be indiscreet. So
they didn’t. Oh, and we had nearly forgotten to men-
tion how pretty tha tickets wore : they wore of a Bug-
gastive flame colour.

After the numerous disappointments caused by
rain tor nearly a fortnight, au extra large number of
people gathered to listen to the Nelson Band in the
Gardens on Monday. They played a capital programme,
and as they occupied their new raised platform, just
erected, the music was rendered more comfortably to
themselves, while affording more satisfaction to the
audience. Plenty of well-dressed promenadera passed
up and down, and tbe chair collector drove a grand
trade also, at tbe remunerative tariff of 21. a seat. This
affable individual, by the way, is one of the most in-
teresting persons on the ground ; he is a soliloquist of
quite an original character, and his remarks, which are
not always complimentary to uis constituents, are ex-
tremely diverting to every one elue. He is now, as
appears by tbe leather tourniquet on his arm, collector
• by appointment,” and ba has been doing so well
lately that he has blossomed oat iu a complete new
suit—lovely lavender—and wears his hat entirely on the
Btxirboaid side.

The Tllawarra Order of Oddfellows held their
annual ball at the Temperance Hall. Wollongong, last
week. The weather was a regular damper, deluge all
day, and between the showers at night the company
wore brought down in ooaohoa and cabs—au unusual
thing in illawarra. There wore decorations, of coarse,
and oabotne Bros.’ refreshments were satisfactory.
Among the candidates for belloehip were two Unan-
derra sisters in white moird antique, one trimmed with
tartan, the other with garnet plush, both skirts fronted
with pearls, low bodices and flowers; also a Sydney
girl in blush moiid antique, trimmed with ferns, lace,
and silver, with a beautiful head of blonde bait—all her
own. Two sisters from the te’egraph offlie in white
tinselled grenadine and ruby satin; several blacks with
bright trimmings; black satin and steel beading; prune
velvet, were among tbe noteworthies. The music of
the Harmony Band was good enough for dancers to en-
joy themselves, which they did till 4 a.m.

Tbe moat novel and splendid entertainment
that has been seen at St. Petersburg!* tor many years
was the ball given by the Grand Duke Wladimir, which
was a complete reproduction of ancient Enssia. All the
guests were in ancient costumes, varying from the 10th
century to the 17th; and tbe servants were attired
similarly, as fools, peasant?, hawkers, etc. Ivan tha
Terrible, Peter the Great, and several of the half-
savage mighty Eomanoff Emperors were represented.
Alltne refreshments and drinks wore ancient, classic
dishes covered the tables, and were served on old china
revived tor tbe occasion, with ancient silver and old-
(asbioned linen. The first pair in tha opening polonaise
were tbo Grand Duke and the Empress, he being in the
character of a 17th century boyatd, in red silk shirt
and green velvet oiftan, wrought all over with rubies
and emeralds in place of beads The next pair ware
the Grand Duchess and the Duke of Edinburgh, whs
was a bayard in dark blue velvet. The Emperor of
Russia was a General of Artillery, the Empress a 17th
century Czarina, and the Duchess of Edinburgh a court
lady in gold cloth, lur hat set with gems, and a net of
pa iris on her hair. The ball, to which oulv 300 gained
admission, was as artistic as it was fantastic,

Tha Hon. William Maoleay, tha oldest member
of tbe N S. VV. Linisnin Society, and its first president,
iu 1874, was the guest of about fifty members at a picnic
on Saturday. There was nothing more frivolous than
cricket indulged in by the scientific and mostly well-
aged gentle uen present, aad very little of that.
Luncheon was the chief event, when Mr. Dailey, as
chairman, proposed the health of " Oar Quest," This
is how, in rhythmic sontoccis, with his favourite three-

•• To you it would be superfluous, to him it would be dis-
tasteful. to me it would be diffl inlt, to speak in his pro.
seuca of that simp'e devotion to science, and that
princely generosity in helping on its advancement which
have marxed hii career. Though a man of splendid
fortune, of tastes and pursuits which would mike a
residence in th i old world one would imagine, singularly
attractive to h'n». and where his soitn iflo reputation
has (or many years been established, he chooses to give
ue the pleasure of his society, ihe advantage of his cul.
turo, and the benefit of his example." Tha guest
replied. He explained that the objects of the society
didn’t “ consist simply of toying wit n beetles and bngs,”
as tome people supposed, bat of a study of the entire
works of the Creator in natural history. The Linnm ins

A Melbourne lady suggests that, instead of the
bazaars, which ruttl a up so m,ny good people's feelings,
tbe churches should raise money precisely as trades-
men do by simply establishing shops. There's no rea-
son to suppose that prepossessing young ladies would
be lees attractive behind a counter than before a stall,
audit’s pretty certain they would retain bettor manners.
There’s no reason either why amateur plays should not
be produced, which would afford ladies a chance to don
fancy dress, while young clergymen as stage heroes
could improve their elocution, and thus be turned to
purposes of both amusement and profit With fins
weather there is sure to be a very large gathering at
the Amateur Athletic Club’s Sports on Saturday, as

Queen, now. she keeps them, anl she tumbled down
stairs. Sir William Clarke has them, and performs the
same inelegant feat. Even Lady Clarke’s father had
" mch bad luck," and it was, no doubt, owing to the
circumstance that he brought a pair of tne royal birds
across from Hobart. His luck, however, didn’t follow
all the family ; for it was scarcely a misfortune for Miss
Snodgrass to change the position of governors for that

a theological sense, being in the prime of life) is popular

to a wife, because he said he could do without the
money better than they could. He even patronises
little dances at the Guild I And now he’s married, they

The Spectator insinuates that the English
jury, in the breach of promise action Hyland v. Biggar,
ware glad of an opportunity of indulging iu their grudge
against the defendant.
The report of Messrs. Morris and Eanken, on
the state of the publio lands and the operation of the
land laws, was laid on the table of the Assembly, on
Tuesday night.

Ballrooms tastefully decorated with Flag or Floral
Decorations on reasonable terms.— Salk & Dare,

It need hardly be said that no clergyman offi-
ciated yesterday at Bowie Wilson’s funeral. About 150
persons stood round the grave at Uookwood, as the
plain polished cedar ootfin was lowered to its bed, and a
short and feeling speech was made by Charles Bright.
There was the unusual sight of about a dozen ladies at
the burial; but no sign of gloomy black was visible-
only plenty of flowers, which are the funeral trappings
of the Spiritualists’ creed. Surely they are better ?
Only a few people went to hear the Artillery
Band play yesterday afternoon in the Gardens, the
usual assemblage gathering instead round the pedestal
of the Queen’s statue, iu King-street, where the new
City Baud made their first publio appearance. The
rumble of trs flic quite prevented their excellent music
being enjoyed, however, and a more suitable place will,
of course, ba selected in future. The seven items were
given by live o'clock, and the “ belltoppers ” of several
o', the b indsmen were beautiful.
We now all know that Lady Florence Dixie’s
yarn about her life having been attempted by three tali
men dressed iu green, and armed with daggers, was
merely an outcome of the taint of insanity which runs
through her ladyship’s family Immediately after the
alleged ooourreaca, a very fashionable English paper
printed this:—“The attempt on the life of Lady
Florence Dixie ought not to be laid to the door of
Fenians. Lady Florence has not attacked these, and
bar mother. Lady Queensberry, to this day supports
the families of the Fenians who murdered Serjeant
Bratt, who are absurdly called the Manchester
Martyrs.”
The most splendid costume at the Queen’s
Drawing-room was decidedly that of Lady Henry
Gordou-Lennox, who was presented by the Duchess of
Wellington The skirt was of pale blue satin, trimmed
with priceless lace; and the train was of "royal”
purple velvet, which looked as though it had been out
ft osi the robes of a deceased Knight of Garter. Tee
I ride wore a profusion of magnificent diamonds and
p ails. she Duchess was in black. No one was moie
admired thanxibdy Ilohester, who was in white satin,
tae train being thickly bordered wuh swanstown. H r
diamonds and pearls rivalled those of Lady Henry.
Trie sisters Lady Tavistock and Lady Henry Somerset
looked charming, dressed alike in dove-coloured sairts,
with black satin trains. It was not a day for the
debutantes to show to advantage, as the conventional
presentation dress is far mote adapted to June than to
March.

Lynch Bellringers in Western Australia. They

Moul and James Moore have finally squared their as*
saalt case. Latter pays £50 and costs...Lotti Wilmot still

tors, including Williamson and Co., applied at Christ-
church for an annulment of Duncan's bankruptcy on the
grounds that he had not resided in the Canterbury dis-
trict within six months of the bankruptcy, and that ho
had not given notice 21 hours before the time fixed
for the first meeting of creditors. There were 36 credi-
tors hailing from all parts of the Australian Colonies,
and the debts amounted to £4000, while there was not a
shilling of assets. At the meeting at which the resolu-
tion recommending a discharge was carried, only five
creditors were present, representing debts to the
amount of £242. Bankrupt opposed the application,
and the Judge took time to consider the matter Old
Paddy Balfleld, the actor, is dead. He was a tailor by
profession, and an actor too. Years ago he half-bnilt
on tha South Head Eoad, a theatre, the money for
which he hoped to get from the publio in shares. The
movement ought to have succeeded, but what killed
Paddy was not the loss of his own money, or the un-
willingness of the public, but to see the bricks which
wore to have been saored to the Thespian art degraded
by being used in the erection of suburban humpies.
Poor Paddy once wrote a play entitled “ Eetribution,”
which was considered good. He appeared as the King

"What do you do,” inquired a friend, ‘ if yon feel

replied the old tragedian, " what do I do ? I bite my

poser who gives promise of greatness. A Stabat Mater

engagement, she will go to Paris to study acting under

The crown which the Court jewellers of 8t
Petersburg were busily engaged in completing for the
Czar’s coronation, is worth not less than £120,000.
Besides several large diamonds, it is studded with fifty-
four enormous pearls, and an historical ruby which has
long been an heirloom in the Eomanoff family. Alto-
gather, the value of the crown, sceptre, orb, and other
Imperial insignia, which the Czar intended using, is
over £2.250,000. The sceptre, for example, is adorned
by the famous “Orlof" diamond, which Mr. Streeter
so sympathetically describes in his " Precious Stones ”
book. It is called Orlof from the fact that one Alexis
Orlof bought it at Amsterdam from an Armenian to
present to the Empress Catherine. It weighs actual l y
eight carats more than our famous Koh-i-Noor, and
is worth, at a moderate computation, £350,000 !

us that the wretched cur whoso ancestors have wrung
all these millions from the miseries of a people hasn’t
the pluck to crown himself. Poor Alick 1 Amongst
other interesting facts connected with the proposed
oronation, it is stated that an emissary of the Czar
has been in England for some time past engaging
athletes, trapezists, tumblers, and other members of
the mountebank fraternity to assist in the elaborate
revels that are to be held in and around Moscow. No
less than 600 acrobats of various kinds have been
secured, a large proportion of whom are of English
birth,

Owing to the heavy losses in Dairy Stock con-
sequent on the drought of last year—the full ex-

the decreasing quantity and advancing price of
Milk reoeived from those Districts, on which we
rely for our chief supply—we are now.'constrained
to intimate to our customers that on and after
Monday, the 7th May, the price of Milk will ba
beven-pbnge per quart.

QLERK’S PATENT GAS ENGINE.
HIGHEST AWARD
for
MOTIVE POWER.
British Section, International Exhibition of Electricity,
1881. PARIS 1831.
IN CLERK’S PATENT GAS ENGINE,
an ignition is made at every revolution, instead of one
ignition in every two or more revolutions, as is usual in
Gas Engines.
The Power is therefore much greater for the size
of the Engine.
By a Special and Simple arrangement, all tendency to
Back Ignition is avoided, and the Engine may be
worked up to its fall available power without irregu-
larity, and it is much steadier than ordinary GAS
ENGINES.
It is extremely simple, has no gearing wheels cf any
kind, and is noiseless in action.
The pressure necessary on the ignition slide is very
low, as the ignitisn port is small—there is thus no lia-
bility of the valve to cut up, or possibility of absorbing
power.

Vo more popnlar delusion exists than that in
""a to Her Majesty's surname The majority of
ourMuntryman belike it to be Guelph, and rest con-
teat with that knowledge. Thera are, however, a few
who know that in marrying Prince Albert of Coburg-
the Sovereign took the surname of her husband,
mn which has for upwards of 450 years been the
family DOgnomeu of the House of Saxony.
The late General Macdonnell, who died in his
ocoVi vear, accompanied Lord Cathcart’s expedition to
1805, and had fought against Murat in the
nfmwlom of the Two Sicilies Ha was 31 when he ac-
nmnanied the 27th Inniskillings to the glories of the
June • and. despite the tact that bo was earned
* the field of Waterloo with three severe wounds in
bio hodv he has managed to survive in peace and quiet
fa enr own days, witnessing, after an interval of close
~Ji„ HBventv years, the destruction of that esprit de
which in his younger days was so greatly
cherished, , , . , ,
Oscar Wilde, in Pans, was entertained by some
members of the liberal professions " at dinner, and
h« made a speech on his American experiences, wherein
h« said the people there derived their notions of paiut-
imr from chromo-lithographs, and their notions of sculp-
ture from ths figures in front of the tobacconists' shops.
In acme places, however, there were symptoms of In-
iinient mithetloiam, and at Leadville eapecially he
fouad some ef his own pet theories had got there before
him. In one corner of thp Casino, he saw a pianist
sitting at a piano over which was this notice: “Please
do not ahoot at the pianiat; he is doing hia best." This
raoogsition of his own theory that bad art merits the
penalty of death afforded the Apostle the deepest
dalight.
Mr. A. N. Hornby, the celebrated Lancashire
cricketer, has announced his intention of contesting
Blackburn at the next general election in the Conserve,
live interest, and his popularity with all classes is said
to ha 80 great that he Is pretty certain to be xeturned.
K Mr. Hornby is only half as good a politician as he is
a sportsman, he will be a vary welcome addition to the
ranks of his party. As a cricketer ho has attained the
highest honours in a twofold sense, having been return-
ed as premier batsman in 1881, and having captained
the Oantlemen against the Players and * ngland against
Australia. Also, although an old Harrovian, Mr.
Hornby went in for Eugby football with such signal
success that he was ohossn to represent England v.
Scotland—the acme of every football player’s ambition.
