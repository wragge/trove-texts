AUTIO!
The extraordinary reputation of Rowland’s Macassar
Oil, Kalydor and Odonto, induces some shopkeepers to
offer spurious imitations under the lure of being cheap;
the principle on which each is prepared is confined
solely to the knowledge of A. Rowland & Sons, of 20,
Hatton Garden, London, and therefore it is highly
necessary to buy no Macassar Oil. Kalydor or Odonto
except those made by them, and which bear their,
name in red ink on the wrappers. %

jiSSSE
This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to his
patients, he lias during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. Ills practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.
YOUNG MEN
who suffer from the results of early follies, trans-
gressions or excesses of more nature age, bladder
difficulties, a whitish or dark ropy sediment in
the water, accompanied by slight burning or
smarting sensation, Headaches, Drowsiness during
the day, circles round the eyes, Giddiness,
irregularity of the bowels, specks before the eyes,
bashfulness, discontentedness, weakness or pains
in the back. Liver or kidney complaints, dreams,
buzzing noises in the ears and head, pimples, a
fear that something dreadful is about to happen,
weak stomach, yellow or blood-shot eyes, impure
blood, hasty, uncontrollable temper, hacking
cough, who cannot marry, nervousness in society,
wakefulness, palpitation of the heart, general
weakness, and other symptoms which lead to in-
sanity and death, should consult him, for he has
mastered these difficulties. On receipt of 6d. in

Showing plainly bow all diseases of the private or
nervous system may be cured thoroughly and per-
manently without unnecessary ex pence. This
book will prove a valuable companion, and even
though you be perfectly well its general infonu-
tion and prescription may assist you in restoring
some poor friend to health even after his case has
been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tenaanb.
ONE POUND IS SUFFICIENT TO
SEND
for Remedies necessary tor the cure of NER-
VOUS DEBIEIT y. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
gerous, it would be advisable for you to sit down
quietly in your chamber and write to the doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. He will
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
oponion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, send for his famous medical
work, the price of which is but sixpence ; enclosed
in the volume will be found a list of carefully-pre-
pared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
Dr. Richards uses nothing but the purest remedies,
and never prescribes mercury under any circum-
stances. The moment letters are carefully per-
used and answered they are destroyed by fire,
and patients may rest assured that their cases
will remain a secret between the doctor and
themselves. Dr. Richards has successfully treated
nearly 25,000 cases since coming to Australia, and
has permission from at least 10,000 persons to
show their written evidence of his success. All
communications should be addressed

SPECIALIST for the Treatment of Nervous
Complaints, Diabetes, Tumors, &c.
Btyitttnd by thi Medical Bunt o/N-S. W. Late Haute Bur-
f eon la Hie Greet Northern Hotpital, London.
I am aware that I am not strictly following the paths
Of professional etiquette by advertising myself as a
Specialist for the treatment of this class of disease, but,
unfortunately for the suffering public in Australia, the
apathy shown by Qualified Hen in the treatment of
Cnrsnfe and Nervous Complaints has induced men of the
lowest grade of intellect (whose only qualifications are
unlimited assurance) to spring up, and by specious
advertisements and false promises trap the unwary.
It is very evident that sufferers from these diseases
have been scandalously treated by these unqualified
persons The evidence taken at the Medical Enquiry
held in Sydney (published in the Daily Telegraph, Boy.
6th. 7th and 8th, 1890) plainly shows the disgraceful
manner in which patients are duped. Mot only are
they robbed of their money, but what is of infinitely
greater importance, their health is injured also. It is
therefore time that legally Qualified Hen entered the
field to fight these pests of society with their own
weapons, viz., Advertising.
It is utterly Impossible for those who are suffering
from these diseases, who are scattered over all parts of
Australasia, to ascertain which Qualified Practitioner
makes these diseases his speciality unless he advertises.
I consider therefore, that by advertising I not only
etrike a blow at the Quackery which now exitte, but I alto add
to the uiefulnett of my prefeeslon and in no way leuen my
perianal dignity.
My Qualifications I Invite the fullest investigation into. For some considerable time I was House Surgeon to the
Great Northern Hospital, London, where X had special opportunities of observing the many phases of the Nervous and
Sexual System, and to become acquainted with the most scientific methods of effecting their cure.
My sole attention is given to the treatment of these diseases, and when a person consults me he is informed at the
commencement whether 1 can effect his core or not. The patient is not deluded with false and specious promises, and
If I undertake the case
I Absolutely Guarantee a Complete and Permanent Cure.
My great success in the treatment of these diseases enables me to give this guarantee without fear.

SATURDAY, MAY 9, 1891,
The Odds against Labour.
The great strike in Queensland is apparently
going downhill, and its approaching end is
so evident that the present is as good a time
as any to write its obituary, and to investi-
gate the causes of its probable collapse.
Like the other movement which fizzled out
a few months ago, the shearers’ “insurrec-
tion promises to taper off slowly, and die
at last through attenuation, when the re-
mains of it have become too thin and scanty
to be called a strike any longer. The steady
approach of winter with its accompaniments
of wind and rain, the want of money, and the
scarcity of provisions, will gradually empty
the strikers’ camps ; and the constant raids
by the police and the alleged troops, the re-
moval of the more prominent leaders, the
ceaseless influx of that species of cannibal
labour which lives by eating up its better
brother, and various other influences, will
probably finish the work at an early date.
But though these are the outwax-d and visible
reasons why capital is likely to be uppermost
at the end of the struggle, they are not in
themselves the cause of the inevitable failure.
They are only the result of other and less
obvious forces, and these latter are worth
investigating.
* # #
Tn the first place, the strike has been bur-
dened from the start by the heavy odds, for
public opinion, as a rule, has been against it.
Public opinion has been well defined as the
sentiment of the bald-headed man at the
back of the omnibus, and the bald-headed
man gets his sentiments from the newspapers,
and the average newspaper keeps its senti-
ments in its hinder pocket. There was no pos-
sible doubt from the beginning as to the views
of the great majority of the Australian press.
The shearer does not advertise, neither does
he help the circulation to any extent worth
mentioning. r Jhe bank that backs the
squatter, and the loan and mortgage com-
pany that sells his wool, do advertise ; and
so do the mining syndicate, and the land-
boom swindle organisation, which are prac-
tically the bank over again, inasmuch as the
proprietors of one institution also own the
other ; and the big fire insurance company
and the building society, which are the same
thing under new names ; and the importer
who has to keep on good terms with the
bank because of his overdraft; and in view of
these matters it is obvious that the average
paper cannot afford to look with a friendly
oye on a common, uninfluential shearer when
he comes in violent concussion with capital.
But the ordinary “Liberal ” journal gets up
a reputation for fearlessness and impar-
tiality by advocating the cause of the weaker
party wherever it can do so without injury
to the advertising business. It looks after
the injured aboriginal when he is shot at by
somebody who doesn’t take up half-a-column
of the front page and it ascends to noble
flights of indignation about the labour traffic
m the South Sea Islands, and it publishes a
whoop of joy and sympathy once a year
when Eight-hour Demonstration Day comes
lound ; and for these reasons it carries
weight and conviction along with it when it
rises reluctantly, and with a look of subdued
pathos in its leading article, to damn its own
Ifrty for the sake of the annual dividend.
And the bald-headed individual at the back
ottho omnibus feels that, when the paper
which has “ consistently supported the cause
o Labour now turns to violent denuncia-
tion, the cause of Labour must be a very bad
cause indeed.
* # #
Ihe information received by the general
as to the events in the so-called “dis-
turbed districts ’ was almost entirely sup-
plied by the metropolitan papers, and these
in turn were supplied by their correspondents
at the scene of inact Tiiese
correspondents lived and messed along with
the police and troops, and took a strictly
police view of the things that happened, and
also of those that did not happen. If a
policeman hit a shearer on the head and then
arrested him for assault, he furnished the
account of the case himself and the corres-
pondent sent it along. If a unionist
escaped from the strikers’ camp, a cor-
respondent was at hand to take down his
reasons for doing so, and as his chance of
assistance and rations and a public subscrip-
tion depended entirely on his horrid tale of
woe, the said tale was always forthcoming.
On the other hand, if a non-unionist joined
the camp, his reasons for “escaping” from
the gentle squatter never came to light. No
correspondent ever dreamt of taking up his
quaiters permanently among the shearers,
and supplying information from their
standpoint, and no one seems to have
taken any particular notice of the omis-
sion. Few things are easier than to
write history from one side only. Even the
racked martyr of the Inquisition would have
figured as a bad character if Torquemada
had supplied all the reports about him ; and
if Abioail had a monopoly of the art of
printing Leo XIII. would go down to
posterity as a species of octopus that lived
in a cave and was covered with ‘scales and
horns and claws, and decorated with a shiny,
black incrustation like squashed snakes.
And this incurable lopsidedness is visible in
every adjective of the press vocabulary.
hen the strikers said nothing they were
sullen, and when the police did exactly
the same they were “maintaining a resolute
attitude. ” If the strikers did nothing they
were “threatening” or “ ominous;” and
when the other party did nothing likewise,
it wasj‘forbearing” and “anxious to avoid
strife.’ The one side was filled with
“ brutal ferocity,” and the other with
“ determined courage,” and very few seemed
to realise that the two were exactly the same
thing, for though codrage was the” thing the
squatter hit with, and ferocity the thing the
shearer hit with, they both left just the
same-sized bruise. If the employers were
gathered together anywhere they were men-
tioned as an “assemblage,” but a similar
gathering of the employes was alluded to as
a “mob, ’ and yet both were the same as a
“congregation.” But the public mostly
takes it for granted that the party which is
an “assemblage ” represents the right cause,
while the party which is a “mob” repre-
sents the wrong one, and, in the vast,
widespread ignorance of the human race in
general, it is necessary to explain that each
term simply means that a lot of people are
together in one place, and blocking up the
footpath. The two things are also synonym-
ous with the brutal and hog-like crowd
m Inch collects to meet a new Governor, and
the only reason why the Riot Act is not
read in the latter case is that the only men
who are empowered to read the Riot Act
are the individuals who compose the crowd.
• # #
The whole concrete force of the law is also
against the strikers. The difficulty is one
between the squatter and the squatter’s em-
and when the latter feels sufficiently
irritated he rises in his capacity as a Justice
of the Peace and sends the other parry to
gaol. The employe may feel equally aggra-
vated, but he can’t send his antagonist to
gaol. The squatter may kick him, and then
arrest him for assault, and then appear in
the witness-box and relate his version of the
case, while the other man—the person who
was kicked—being in the dock, is not allowed
to give any evidence at all. If the shearer
could arrest the squatter for qnce by way of
variety, and then smother him by putting
him in the dock, while he himself occupied
the witness-box, the general aspect of the
affair would doubtless be somewhat different.
The questions at issue affect the whole class
of pastoralists, and almost every 1 usli J.P.
is a pastoralist ; consequently everyone is
sitting in judgment on his own cause. The
country banker, solicitor, and storekeeper
are on the same side, for they all have
business relations with the pastoralist and
depend in a certain measure upon his sup-
port, whereas the nomadic shearer affords
very little support to anyone, excepting,
possibly, the back-blocks publican. Also the
small selector goes with the party of “law
and order,” for he supplements his earn-
ings by shearing on cheap blackleg
principles, and the professional shearer’s
difficulty is his best opportunity. Conse-
quently, when the itinerant remover of wool
is brought up before a local court, it is gener-
ally the case that the magistrate who ordered
his arrest, the bench which committed ■ him,
the jury which tried him, the witnesses who
swear against him, the poliqe, the spectators,
and even the solicitor who defends him,
have a strong persuasive interest in, his con-
viction, inasmuch as the prosecution repre-
sents the whole aggregate power of capital,
whereas the defence represents neither
money, land, joolitical influence, nor any
other tangible security whatever.
* * #
That the Government should throw its
whole weight into the scale on behalf of the
employers was a foregone conclusion, fox-
many reasons. In the first place, the finan-
cial interests, of almost every individual
member of the Cabinet are at stake, and even
the possible loss of a portfolio in the future
is a small matter compared to a serious
monetary disaster in the present. Unless
the strike is extinguished by violent means
there is almost a certainty of a prolonged
and ruinous conflict, in the course of which
the wool industry will be all but extinguished
for the time being. To those politicians who
are directly interested in pastoral property
this would mean something approaching in-
solvency, and to the politician who lives by
mercantile pursuits the results would be
almost equally disastrous through the general
paralysis of trade which would necessarily
ensue. The banks would lose enormously
through the collapse of the deejdy-mortgaged
squatter, and almost evexy member of the
House who possesses any assets whatever is
either a bank shareholder, or is indebted to a
bank, and therefox-e amenable to judicious
pressure. In fact, every maa of wealth in
the community is interested in keeping the
staple industry of the country going by any
means, however disreputable, and it can
only be kept going by forcing one of the
contending parties to a prompt sur-
render. Which of the two should surrender
is a question that admits of only one answer.
The pastoralists, and all the great mass of
traders and capitalists whose interests are
linked to theirs, supply nine-tenths of the
members of both Houses and fill every seat
in the Cabinet; they command, directly and
indirectly, an enormous number of votes
throughout the country ; they are able to
enforce the allegiance of every public servant
down to the Corporation dustman; and even
should the Assembly, by any astounding
contingency, desert them, they have a hold
on the nominee branch of the Legislature
which will last till the ancient Conservatives
of that Chamber die of old age, and make
way for a new' order of senators. Also, as
the natural result of their other privileges,
they own the police, the alleged army
and navy, and most of the public press ;
and they have a lien on the Education
Department, and consequently on the public
opinion of the rising generation ; while the
revolted employes, owing to their nomadic
habits, have hardly even one vote to every
ten men, and their hostility at the next
general election is scarcely worth reckoning.
Assuredly, if one party must be squashed,
no one, save a disinterested patriot, could
hesitate in choosing between them.
* * *
The police and the so-called troops are
reliable servants of the capitalistic interest
—partly for the sake of their wages, and
partly through conviction and unreasoning
prejudice. It is the ambition of the typical
military officer to command a force which is
utterly devoid of all public sympathies ; and
the model soldier is an unreasoning and soul-
less being who will shoot and bayonet any-
body or everybody when ordered to do so,
and will gallop over his own father in the
cause of “ order ” without an instant’s hesi-
tation. The ordinary standing army will
stand by any sort or description of Govern-
ment ; and though its component parts may
be taken from the ranks of the most down-
trodden nation in existence, yet in a very
few years it will look upon itself as some-
thing apart from that nation, and will be
prepared in almost every instance to take the
part of the rulers against the people. So far
as concerns this great quality of clam-like in-
sensibility, the Australian troops are probably
about the mostunsatisfactory in the world, but
still both they and the police have acquired
sufficient of what is termed the “military
sentiment,” to make it tolerably certain that
they would almost shoot anybody or anything
that they were told to shoot, partly through
the instinct of obedience, and partly through
the predatory instinct which is the inevitable
concomitant of a gun, and a horse, and a
uniform. And, in addition to these forces, a
large number of railway employes and the
like, were sworn in as special constables, and
when this force realised—through the sum-
mary discharge of everybody who declined
to act as a special constable—that it had to
be bloodthirsty arrd enthusiastic or lose its
means of subsistence, it grew exceedingly
bloodthirsty on the spot; and should it find
a favourable opportunity it will probably—
for the sake of its billet and its salary—do
good service in the cause of ‘ ‘ law and
order. ”
* * *
And, in addition to these tremendous odds,
the cause of capital can muster a few more
stray auxilliaries who may prove valuable.
If anybody is killed on either side, or dies a
natural dea#b, the coroner will come in handy
to whoopupa verdict of murder if the deceased
is a non-unionist, or to stifle the inquiry if he
is an obnoxious shearer ; and the Resident
Magistrates will doubtless bear a hand. It
is already understood that, when Parliament
meets, something serious will happen to
Chief Justice Lilley on account of his
democratic tendencies, and when a man of
such eminence is in danger, it is tolerably
evident that any smaller official will be
promptly extinguished should his zeal not
prove up to the mark. The law of property
can be put in force, should the strikers
refuse to commit any act which will justify
their arrest- on other grounds ; for every
shearer is no doubt trespassing on some-
body’s estate, and, moreover, this law is so
far-reaching that nearly everybody can be
arrested on a general charge of being any.
wherp, when once the statute is worked for
all it is worth. Also, when provisions and
money run short the whole crowd is liable
to get twelve months’ imprisonment for
having no visible means of support, and, in
addition, every man who owns a saddle or a
knife or any other article can be arrested on
a general charge of having property in his
possession which is “reasonably supposed to
be stolen.” Furthermore, some'of them are
“in illegal possession of firearms,” and they
are all wanted on a wide and pro-
miscuous charge of “intimidation,” for,
according to a recent English precedent,
which was duly endorsed by the House of
Commons, even the act of demanding an in-
crease of wages, with the alternative-of a
strike, constitutes intimidation, and renders
the offender liable to a long term of im-
prisonment. And lastly, the whole move-
ment is an “unlawful combination” under
certain old, dog-eared statutes of the days
gone by, and the union of employers by
which the present difficulty was brought
about is equally unlawful; but as the latter
class will certainly not issue warrants against
themselves, and arrest themselves, after
stunning themselves with a policeman’s club
in the process, and finally send themselves to
gaol, this enactment holds good against the
men only. Therefore, to sum the situation
up, the shearers and the working classes
generally have not one lawful weapon at
command nor one solitary legal means of
asserting their claims against their em-
ployers. They have no parliamentary
representatives, for by some unspeakable
infatuation the representatives they (i.e.,
those of their number who have votes) elect
belong, almost to a man, to the class with
which they are at variance. They have no
visible share in the law, for it is made by
their opponents, and administered in a great
measure by an unpaid magistracy consisting
exclusively of capitalists, and interpreted by
a close corporation which supplies justice at
a rate which is only within the reach of the
wealthy. And in the face of odds like these
strikes in general are merely chronic insanity.
So long as Labour gives its suffrage to
landlords, merchants, bankers, squatters,
lawyers, and all manner of capitalists, and
gives its enemies full power to turn the
army, the police, the law, and all the other
resources of the State against it, there is
little to be gained by contending with the
power it has itself done so much to create.
Even all the multiplied vote of Property
would fail in many cases to boss the Legis-
lature but for the apathy and disunion of the
masses. If at one general election, and one
only, the Australian people would vote to
the last man for their own cause, and hang
up all extraneous questions till the present
oligarchy of capitalists was abolished, they
could do more in one year to render strikes
unnecessary than strikes themselves will ac-
complish in a century.
Iscariot on Trades-Unionism.
The Australian daily press has reprinted, with
great glee, an effusion on labour agitations from
the Buffalo Iron Industry Gazette, written by
an individual who candidly labels himself
“ Absalom.” It does not appear why an advo-
cate of the privileges that centuries of rotten
precedent have vested in the dominant classes
should choose the designation of an insurgent
and incestuous Hebrew of old, but The Bul-
letin would not question his right to call him-
self Judas Iscariot if he thought fit. In fact,
it is going to call him Judas for short. The
picture Judas draws is a pathetic one of
capital, after thirty years’ of patient forbear-
ance under the intolerable and unreasonable
tyranny of organised labour, driven at last in
desperation to form a defensive counter combi-
tion. He gives an anticipatory chuckle over
the squelching that is in store for the workers—
When organised capital takes up the sword against
organised folly and lawlessness, masquerading under the
name of labour, and in one mighty battle scatters the
army and wrecks the structure of so-called trades-
unionism beyond all hope or possibility of repair.
And papers like the Sydney Daily Telegraph
illustrate their boasted democratic proclivities
by reprinting him a column at a time with
gloating approval.
“ Capital,”says Iscariot, “is not forcing or
inviting the contest. It does not offend. It
merely defends. ” Which suggests the remark
that when the Southern planters took the field
in the American civil war to maintain their
GoD-given right to keep their niggers in slavery,
they did not invite the contest. They did not
hanker after any war of abolition ; they merely
acted on the defensive. They would have been
quite content to remain undisturbed in peaceful
possession of the slaves they had legally in-
herited or legally bought, and to legally whop
them, legally sell them, and legally make
concubines of them after the good old fashion of
their fathers; but, to quote Iscariot once
more, “ they began to see that they could no
longer safely trust their interests to the mercies
of the organised demagogues ” of the North.
The man who had the plunder has never been
conspicuous for a burning desire that there
should be any contest for it. No Czar, with a
fairly safe seat on his despotic throne; has ever
immortalised himself in the annals of his
race by inviting a revolt against his tyranny
that was likely to be successful. Curiously
enough, it is pretty generally the plundered


What a golden opportunity was lost by
Parkes in not championing the one-man-one-vote
principle as the bedrock foundation of any federal
constitution ! Of course it is argued that Parkes
is favourable to the one-man-one-vote system.
Parkes is “ favourable ” to a thousand things, and
has politically travelled on some of them for 80
years right off without ever once honestly en-
deavouring to put them into practice. Even now,
as Thk Bulletin has pointed out, Parkes does
not really mean to inaugurate in N.S.W. the
reign of one-man-one-vote, which would certainly
be assented to by Parliament, but he proposes
(tacked on to his Electoral Bill) one-woman one-
vote, which would just as certainly be rejected.
The rejection of one-woman-one-vote would, how-
ever, mean the destruction of the Bill proposing
one-man-one-vote. Therefore, Parkes,is “riding
for a fall,” and The Bulletin sincerely hopes
that the fall will break his political neck, lie
cackles about enfranchising the women, bet him
first enfranchise the men.
and not the plunderer, the oppressed and not
the oppressor,’who first get the idea of forcing
the contest. And when the contest is in full
swing, the plunderer and the tyrant very fre-
quently come to the conclusion that “they can
no longer safely trust their interests to the
mercies of the organised demagogues ” who
oppose them. Their interest's ! The interests
of the capitalistic ring that has made humanity
its beast of burden since the days of the
Pharoahs will not be very safe when the
human race throws off its chains and Democracy
comes into its birthright.
“ Capital is showing its teeth against organ-
ised crime, masquerading under the name of
organised labour ! ” Fudge ! Organised crime
has masqueraded for centuries under the name
of capital. It is a fashionable fallacy to suppose
that capital; is now for the first time commenc-
ing to organise. Civilised society, with all its
paraphernalia of parliaments, and law courts,
and gaols, has been mainly a great organisation
for the defence of the vested interests of capital,
and privilege, and monopoly, against the just
claims of the toiling masses of the human race.
The crime of crimes, backed up and abetted by
every living institute that claims for itself a share
in the vaunted glory of the nineteenth century,
is the denial to the world’s workers of free access
to the avenues of production, and the grabbing
of the natural sources of wealth by land-jobbers,
rings, and trusts innumerable, and all the tribe
of noxious vermin that batten on the great
dunghill of modern society. These are the true
dangerous classes ; there is the proper place to
look for organised crime. There lies the respon-
sibility for the lives of brutalising toil, and
vice, and squalid misery, that millions of our
brethren are yearly born into in this splendid
age of civilisation and enlightenment. And
Iscariot stands amazed at the forbearance of
capital in not inviting a contest !

When the sleeping Samson was bound with
green withes and new ropes, the Philistines
exulted in the delusive hope that his giant
strength was mastered. Capital, with its new-
fangled scheme of combination, fondly cherishes
the vain idea that labour is now fast in the
toils. “The Philistines be upon thee, Samson,”
crows Delilah. The liers-in-wait abide in the
inner chamber. If they are prudent they will
stay there. Samson is not yet shorn.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Australia, the Same Old Rubbish-Heap.
The incurable European philanthropist is suf-
fering from the rush of a new inspiration to the
head. The anti-Semitic policy of the Russian
Government promises to set 500,000 Hebrews
loose upon the earth, and as it is necessary to
lind a new location for this itinerant nation, it
is suggested that Brazil and Australia should
divide the army between them. How Brazil
feels on the subject is not stated, but if that
Republic has sense enough to come in out of the
wet, it will pick the barnacles off its big iron-
clads, and turn its army loose along the coast
to shove the coming Israelite back into the sea ;
and, as for the feeling of Australia, it can
safely be asserted that this country will blaze
in wild insurrection before it will admit 250,000
Hebrew paupers, for even General Booth’s
horde of uncertain pilgrims would be a blessing
by comparison. The curse of Australia under
present conditions is that the proportion of
working men is too small, and the proportion of
merchants, shopkeepers, pawnbrokers, ‘ ‘ shindy-
kits,” financiers, and similar monetary birds of
prey is too large, and if the proposed influx
ever reaches these shores it will merely mean
the establishment of 250,000 more ‘ ‘ shindy kits. ”
There are only two alternatives for the Israelite
up to date, as his best friends admit in a
more or less roundabout way : he, must
either be a pauper or some kind of a “ shindy-
kit.” In Russia the Government has done its
level best to make him the former, because the
country is miserably poor, and the Czar and
the Jewish financier both desire to grab all the
coin that is to be found in the empire, and
Alexander 111. recognises the obvious fact
that if the Hebrew is allowed to exploit the
country, he may knout his subjects till the day
of judgment without extracting enough to pay
for the wear and tear of the executioner. In
Australia, however, where the State has no
adequate machinery for sitting on the obtrusive
tribes, he would certainly help to swell the
ranks of the great army which lives on com-
missions and per-centages. The Israelite never
digs except under compulsion ; he will neither
be an agriculturist, a miner, a fisherman,
a sailor, nor an artisan; he never opens up
a new country or goes pioneering on the
confines of civilisation ; he is seldom drowned,
for he takes no risks, and his wildest adventures
are in discounting dubious paper at an immense
amount per shent; he is still less frequently
eaten by cannibals, for unless the cannibals
called at his pawnshop and ate him there, they
could never, by any possibility, come in contact.
When a mine caves in, nobody having a Jewish
cognomen is ever lost among the debris, and if
the country is invaded nobody named Moses
ever rushes upon the enemy and perishes in the
forefront of the battle. The attempt to treat
the Israelite as an ordinary citizen fails of
necessity, because he declines to take his share
111 the hardships and hazards of humanity ;
and even Hebrew patriotism is a fraud, for the
Hebrew would rather stay away from his
beloved city of Zion through all time, than go
back to dig up the neglected fields of Judea,
and hump bricks for the re-building of Jerusa-
e.nb ail d pound road-metal to repair the streets
°f the ancient capital of Solomon. The money

America would suffice to start a tributary king-

Even the Chinaman is cheaper in the end than
the Hebrew, and if Australia has to choose
between the two Asiatics, the one with the tail
is preferable to the one with the Talmud every
time. We owe much to the Jew—in more than
one sense—but until he works, until a fair per-
centage of him 'produces, he must always be
against the democracy. Above all, the Russian
Jew, who has been kicked and whipped and
branded, will, in the inevitable course of things,
be a groveller and a sneak when he finds him-
self in the sunlight of freedom.
An Old Constitutional Pungus.
So far as can be gathered from present indica-
tions it is quite possible that at least three
shaky Governments will “go before the
country ” on the Australian Federation ques-
tion, and come back refreshed and invigorated
by the process. That is to say, the country
will be informed that if-it wants Federation it
must vote Parkes or Munro or the ponder-
ous Playford, or some other nonentity, into
office for a certain term of years, and if it wants
to get rid of any one of the three it must
abandon the Federation principle indefinitely.
The country may want Federation and may
loathe Parkes or Munro or Playford, or all
three combined; but matters will, if possible,
be judiciously fixed so that it must take or
leave the whole lot. It is one of the great
axioms of the Constitut ion that when the nation
desires to assert an important principle it can
only do it by shunting some particular politi-
cian into office, and though it may detest him,
and abhor every other item in his programme,
it must go the whole hog in his policy, or do
without the one principle it desires. In other
words, the individual who wants a flower must
take an ash-heap or a dead dog along with it,
or else dispense with the flower altogether. If
New South Wales be hungering after Freetrade
it must also take Parkes, and the Dead House,
and the Woman Suffrage Bill, and the Yellow
Pup organisation, and the principle of Imperial
grovel, and a dozen other things besides ;
but it has absolutely no means of accept-
ing or even expressing an opinion on one
of these without accepting the whole pile. It
can’t by any known possibility declare for
Protection and the Imperial connection to-
gether, for if it wants Protection, it must
accept Hires, and if it wants to howl in the
cause of “ loyalty ” it has to swallow Parkes.
It can’t combine Freetrade and the abolition of
imprisonment for debt, because Parkes sup-
plies the Freetrade, and Dibbs is the only man
of influence in the Assembly who really desires
to abolish the nefarious law by which a debtor
is treated as a common malefactor. In like
manner, the Maorilander, who wants to declare
for bald-headed Republicanism, can only make
himself intelligible by voting Sir George Grey
to the head of the State, but though Grey can
do almost everything else on earth, his finance
is execrable. Therefore, the nation reluctantly
fired its idol out some ten years ago, and put up
in his stead a commonplace man with a cheese-
monger’s soul, whose one good quality was a
certain shopkeeping instinct that enabled him
to make both ends meet. It would gladly have
declared for every item of Grey’s policy, bar-
ring only his inability to raise money, but as it
was, it had to endorse all his successor’s blun-
ders for the sake of his financial instincts—to
buck against even one of his more conspicuous
idiocies meant to return to practical insol-
vency. What the country requires is some
adaptation of the Swiss principle, by which all
important measures can be voted direct by the
people, for a dissolution of Parliament has as
much relation to what is really wanted as a
chair has to a quadruped. If Munro is to
reinstate Gillies with his ruinous railway
policy and his garbled accounts ; and if the
people of New South Wales desire Federation
they will find Parkes and the Yellow Pup
attached thereto ; for the three have arranged
to travel together, which is about as reasonable
as planting a dinner, a corpse, and a heap of
mud on the same table. There is no reason in
this grand old system. It contains neither
sense nor grammar, nor coherence, nor common
honesty ; it does no good to anybody except
the politician himself; and it exists only because
it is superlatively English and superlatively
idiotic. And above all other evils it blocks the'
path of progress, for the nation cannot pro-
nounce for any simple reform without entrust-
ing almost absolute power to the individual
reformer, and he, in all probability, is choke-
full of folly in all save this one particular. And
when a man is unable to buy a threepenny drink
unless he takes an elephant along with it at so
much per pound, he generally prefers to go
thirsty.
The Old Unionism and the New.
We seem to have met this item of lying drivel
before, or else it was this drivel’s brother or
other near relation. There is a deep-rooted,
old-established look about the glaring assertion
—a look of old age and hard wear and tear, and
we have fallen over something so very like it in
a hundred capitalistic papers that it seems as
familiar as a gallows, or a public-house, or a fat
snuffle-buster in a white waistcoat. Here it is :
The Old Unionism has the entire community for it B
friend ; the New Unionism, which encourages strikes and
the suasion ofjorce, has no friends.
There is not much in that little, bald assertion,
and yet it is by judicious concessions of this
sort that the monopolist press builds up a repu-
tation for liberality of sentiment, and gets the
ear of the masses. The Old Unionism is dead
and gone and utterly useless ; it was a system
of guerilla warfare and small, disconnected
strikes, which—if it existed to-day—could be
snuffed out in an instant by the great Em-
ployers’ Union ; and, now that it is defunct, the
employers regard it with the same admiration
that a man with a Winchester rifle regards a
club, when he urges his opponent to stick to
that obsolete weapon, and come on. When the
Old Unionists first started, however, they were
transported and imprisoned and fined and occa-
sionally hanged by the authority of Capital,
and the capitalist began to admire them only
when their day was over ; and, in like manner,
when the New Unionism is dead, and some
more powerful system has taken its place,
the democrats of the future will be informed
that they are a low and contemptible assem-
blage compared with the Unionists of 1891,
whose courage and frankness moved the Upper
House to admiration, and drew tears from land
companies and financial associations, and made
banks of issue with a large paid-up capital give
way to uncontrollable emotion, and caused
hardened syndicates to embrace them and
call them brother. This is the same dodge
which is resorted to by the modern
British Tory; he scorns the Irish Home
Ruler of to-day as being a mean and degenerate
wretch compared to his predecessors, Emmett,
Wolfe Tone and Edward Eitzgerald, who
were a trio of noble enemies to whom any Tory
would gladly extend the right-hand of friend-
ship ; and as all three of them are dead now,
having been living or shot by their Tory con-
temporaries, this sentiment looks well and
amounts to very little. The “ liberal-minded’
capitalist always worships some dead democrat
and howls at every live one ; but then the dead
democrat is of no particular use, and the whole
thing is only drivel and lying and mean
hypocrisy after all. Even the most rampant of
all Conservative editors publishes sundry affable
and brotherly observations whenever Eight-
hour Day comes round, and bids the workers
admire the founders of that glorious system—
seeing that the founders are dust and the
system can’t be helped; and tells them to
beware of “mercenary agitators ” —because the
mercenary agitators are still alive; and urges
them to tread in the footsteps of Daniel
O’Connell or Columbus or Julius Cjesar—
it doesn’t matter who it is, so long as he is
defunct, and can’t leave any more footsteps.
And then he invariably finishes up with a burst
of generous pathos about some more corpses,
and points out to everybody who is dissatisfied
with his reduced wages, or objects to work
along with a Chinaman, that if these corpses
had remained alive they would have inculcated
patience and forbearance instead of strikes ami
dissension. Which is about as much to the
point as asserting that if Rameses had been
Solomon he would have objected to the open-
ing of public-houses on Sunday, and that J ohn
Hancock would have backed him up if he had
been Moses.
♦
Give Caesar His Due.
The Bulletin desires to offer its heartfelt sym-
pathy to the several Australian Governments.
Their inflexible determination to keep an atti-
tude of austere neutrality in the labour con-
flicts is constantly being thwarted in a most
irritating way by the perversity of circum-
stances. It is extremely annoying. The utmost
purity of intention is an unavailing shield
against calumny, and irreproachable fair-minded-
ness goes for nothing in the face of a long series
of unlucky coincidences that will persist in
inviting malicious misinterpretation. Take the
Griffith Cabinet in Queensland, for example.
In the present crisis when they are striving to
hold the balance even between the contending
sheepowners on the one hand, and shearers on
the other. What could be more disagreeable
than to be obliged to take any step which would
directly advantage either side ? And yet at
this critical moment, when the tide of battle
may be turned this way or that by any fluctu-
ation in the state of the labour market, when
any addition to the ranks of the unemployed
means a crushing blow to unionists and
unionism, the unfortunate government find
themselves driven against their will, with all
their vigorous instincts of fair play outraged and
overborne, suddenly to put a stop to the erection
of public buildings. They are spending so
much money in paying soldiers that they can’t
afford any to pay labourers. And yet because
what they did happened to lie just what the
squatters wanted they will have to suffer
under the cruel and unjust imputation of doing it
because the squatters wanted it. About the same
time the New South Wales Railway Commissio-
ners, notwithstanding their well-known sympathy
with labour in its struggle for freedom, are
under the reluctant necessity of announcing, in
a carefully-worded paragraph supplied to the
daily press, that it is in contemplation to reduce
the number of men employed in connection
with the railways. That will mean a further
addition to the ranks of the unemployed, and
the Government will probably have to bear the
undeserved odium of an act that will be un-
fairly tortured into an underhand attempt to
put pressure on the labour organisations. It
must be most disheartening to have things
turn out in that awkward way, and, as we said
before, we tender the various Cabinets our
sincerest sympathy.

Exit “ Jackeroo.”
Dear Bulletin, “ Dipso’s ” verses anent
Dummyism strike home fairly on the 640-acre
man ; but, since the passing of the last New
South Wales Land Act, which introduced the
homestead lessee—the 10,240-acre man —quite
a toney set of dummies have arisen. In the
“Bachelors’ Hall” of any large Western dis-
trict station of New South Wales one is safe to
encounter quite a squad of the new bloods.
In lieu of “Greenhide and Whipthong,
blank jackeroos,” it is now “ Messrs. Veracity
and Swareit, of Back Bohendie, homestead
lessees.” The “boss,” who most probably
“knew’em in the ould country,” swears that
they are “fine young fellers; often up here;
bit lonely on their homesteads, you know; of
course, they’ve collared our country, but men
must live, and if we were pushed for grass
they’d let us arrange to graze on their land till
they stock up ; anyway, they’re a sanguinary
sight better than gory selectors.” The “ boss,”
too, drives them into the township when the
Land Court sits, suggests what improvements
are necessary, and gives them a “friendly
letter ” to a Sydney forwarding-firm, who send
up wire, &c., on terms that make a bona-fide
homesteader green with envy. Somehow or
other Veka ity and Swareit never do “ stock
un,” and the “boss’s” sheep graze uninter-
ruptedly on their leases for five years.
Should Inspector Lynx be too inquisi-
tive, he is shown an agreement whereby
Messrs. Opulence and Co. have the right of
grazing on Veracity and Swareit's land, by
payment of (say) £3O per annum, in advance ;
but Inspector Lynx is rarely so curious as to
necessitate that. He plays tennis with the
‘ ‘ tine young fellers ” and the head-station ladies,
and proceeds on his official tour quite satisfied
that the Act is properly complied with. The
Act has introduced a new class of dummy—and
of perjurer. The unsecured land still goes
sweetly to the monopolist, but through a higher
class of man than the old-time selector, who
was mostly a rough, objurgative boundary-
rider, habituated to taking his ‘ ‘ fling ” at Land
Court times, and to making himself obnoxious
to the “ boss ” by publicly offering his “ selec-
tion, including the station-house,” for “a
fiver,” unless the old man “stood” another
cheque on which to “sober up.” It is often
curious to note how friendly a “homestead
lessee,” as defendant, remains with a city firm,
as plaintiff] despite the fact that a Supreme
Court verdict results in the former being “ sold
up.” It is also curious to note that the
“station,” on which the lease is situated, is
generally the “buyer” at that sale. The term
“jackeroo,” as applied to new-chums on
stations, might well be abolished for that of
“ homestead lessee.” — Yours, &c., Lizard.
At Angathella (Q.) strike camp, 40 unionists
were recently arrested, 22 of them at night, the
magistrates having read the Riot Act while the
men were asleep, and then ordered the Mounted
Infantry to arrest them. This outrage on
justice, in the name of law, has parallels in
Queensland history. In the “old days,”
when either police or civilians, or a mixture of
both, were on a butchering expedition against
blacks, it was the custom for a magistrate to
accompany the party. The black trackers
having located the doomed camp, the magistrate,
standing on a rise from which its fire-smoke
could be seen (or perhaps not), would gabble -
over the Riot Act, not only out of hearing, but
in English, as a matter of course, so
that, had the niggers even been within
hearing, they could not have understood the
fatal significance of the burlesque. This was
done in order legally to remove the subsequent
massacres out of the category of murders—in
fact, to give all present a license to kill with
impunity. So, in the Angathella case, had a
hireling - soldier playfully pricked the heart
of a unionist with his bayonet, while effecting
his arrest, this reading of the Riot Act over
sleeping men would have shielded him from any
risk of a murder-prosecution. The “ freedom”-
of-contract press has nothing to say about this
episode, of which, indeed, The Bulletin was
ignorant until enlightened by the full reports
of the Western Champion, the Barealdine
newspaper — not a shearers’ organ. Yet, when
a unionist-shearer sneezes in the presence of
blacklegs, or police, or soldiers, the dreadful
news is flashed southwards and displayed in big
type under blood-red headings in the daily
press.
Australians who pine for death or glory in the
military service of their country will profit by
remembering that the “so-English” system of
caste is being carefully nurtured, and that the
traditions of the British army and navy, where
the prize-money goes to the officers and the
bullets to Tommy Atkins, are being slavishly
imitated. The Middle Head (FT.S.W.) torpedo-
explosion illustrates the nature of the incidence
of “ compensation,” as it falls unequally upon
the peacocky, gold-laced officers and the plain
privates who risk themselves in service. Thus,
the widow of a lieutenant who is killed is
allowed £BO per annum, and £l5 per child, as
compassionate allowance ; but the widow of a
“non-commissioned officer,” or private, is, the
public is darkly informed, allowed “but a
fraction ”of these amounts. Widow Hammand,
with three children, gets £125 per annum ;
Widow Bedford, with four children, £l4o—
Hammand and Bedford having been
lieutenants. What Widow M‘Kee can draw
under the regulations is so small a sum that
the Department seems ashamed to mention it.
The very persons who, from the distressful
nature of their circumstances, require the most
assistance, get the least. It is time that death
distinctions were re-assorted, even if they
cannot, owing to other social considerations,
be obliterated.
Quite recently a prisoner in Berrima (N.S.W.)
Gaol who believed lie had been unjustly punished
by the gaoler, attempted suicide in order to
bring his case before the public. He was tried
at the Assizes last week before Judge Foster,
who said he had made out a strong case, and
the jury acquitted the prisoner. It remains to
be seen now what steps the Minister for Justice
wall take regarding the conduct ot the gaol
authorities. Berrima prison, which is used for
the purpose of driving prisoners mad by the
revolting and useless system of “separate”
treatment, had the reputation of being as bad
as the Bastille until the late Richard Driver
obtained a special committee to inquire into its
working, and disclosed the inhuman treatment
to which prisoners were subjected. When the
State hands convicts over to the keeping of men
who, as they practically exercise their enormous
powers in secret, are, in many respects, abso-
lutely irresponsible, it places in their hands a
life-or-death tyranny. Once the gaol-authorities
are discovered to have betrayed their trust
they must be summarily wiped out of official
existence.

846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney, May 6,1891.
My Dear Moorabinua,—
For and against the cause of the unhappy “lady
helps” the. dailies arc swarming with pathetic effusions
from “ Pro Bono Publico ” and his tribe—some of whom
(cheese-paring housekeepers, probably) absolutely weep
over the manifest advantages of sitting at table with the
“family ” and flirting with the master on the parlour sofa
instead of behind the kitchen door, the privilege of the
“ help,” not the kitchen maid. No amount of arguing
(says in effect one wily domestic economist) can alter the
fact that a lady-help is quite another being from the
ordinary servant girl—“ A sufficient proof is shown that
such persons are specially advertised for. If the adver-
tiser wanted only an ordinary servant she would say so,
aud not ask for a lady-help.” This is really an ingenious
piece of sophistry, and calculated to make Miss Jones
more devotedly attached than ever to her hungry calling
and threadbare frocks-for even though she is made to
cook, wash, and scrub, still she is not a domestic servant
since she was not specified as such in the advt. ! This is
t he pet logic of the woman with the hatchet face and the
wizened heart who, oftentimes on the same social level,
or beneath it, of the most rough-cut lady-help who ever
darkened the door of a registry-office, must chuckle in
her sleeve as she presses the “advantage ” of sitting,oppo-
site her tilted soup-plate and square elbows to the foolish
female who is willing to give up half her fair dues so that
she may bask in the light of her employer’s vulgarities,
and, instead of “giving impudence,” endure taking it!
There are .some houses where there might be some social
and intellectual profit in joining in the home life to a
certain extent, but these, as a rule, do not employ lady-
helps, who mostly crop up in middle-class suburban
households, where the baby is present at every meal, and
mamma leaves off short in the middle of her monotonous
complaints about everything under the roof to spank a
grubby olive-branch for dipping his fist in the sugar.
In her speech at the Ambulance Convention, Lady
Jersey generously remarked: “ If there is anything I can
do to further the interests of the ladies of N.S.W., it will
always give me the greatest pleasure to do it”—which
struck yours ever as being about the most comprehensive
\ ice-regal promise on record. There are dozens of ways
in which “Her Ex.” can “advance the interests” of
the adjacent she, who is generally thirsting after some-
thing or other. For instance, it would “ advance the
interests” of a considerable section if Lady Jersey in-
cluded them in the list of guests at her next ball, since
the I’aradise of the average “N.S.W. woman is (to para-
phrase the Persian idea) easily made by a vice-regal smirk
or a waltz with an aide.” But then Lady J. only meant—
if she meant anything at all—that she would watch over
the interests in a speechifying sense. Now that the head
of N.S.W. society has glided into the position of patron-
saint to the Ambulance Club, there will be another out-
burst of lint and splints and fervour, and once more the
enthusiast of the home circle will insist upon borrowing
your arm or your leg to aid her practice, aud bind you up
with tourniquets and things until she stops your circula-
tion—although it generally happens that if you cut
your finger, you have to catch your own cobwebs
while she screams in the corner. But there! no one is
really interested in the ambulance when its patron isn’t
looking.
Somebody gushingly suggests (in accordance with the
safe principle of worshipping the rising and not the
setting sun) that the prospective Sydney University
Women’s College should be named after Lady Jersey—
although that lady has had little or nothing to do with it.
If this expensive educational boarding-house is to be bap-
tised in an odour of vice-regality, it should certainly
stand in Lady Oarington’s name, since that vanished angel
was a very active patroness—but why not christen the
building with a less popinjay title than either of the two?
“The Lady Jersey College” reads like the truckling of
some suburban school-marm to get up a catchy prospec-
tus. Has Australia really never produced up to date any
woman worth commemorating i
It is very amusing to hear the wealthy and close-fisted
matron (your rich woman is proverbially stingy), designat.
ing as “the governess,” a useful young woman who i s
really taken on as a maid, companion and stocking-darner.
.Since Lady Oarington made governesses the fashion
there has been a demand for these chameleonic
and, as in some houses the infants are too small to be
instructed, the economical chatelaine isn’t going to em-
ploy a real governess just for the look of the thing—not
she. The trick is to choose an educated woman as he v
Abigail, whom she introduces into the drawing-room after
dinner as the “ children’s governess,” with all the airs in
life, and very few people guess as Abigail’s white fingers
Hip about on the piano that they have also combed out
their hostess’s back hair. It is, of course, a dreadfully
shoddy thing to do, hut still it is done in half-a-dozen
Sydney “Mansions.”
The danger of signing a document without thoroughly
reading it was exemplified in a Sydney court
‘■he other day—when a married woman applied for
leave to amend her nuptial settlement, whioh was
brought to her only a few honrs before her wedding,
and which she signed right off oa the assurance that it
“ was according to instructions ” —which it wasn’t. It
was a very natural thing for a woman to do in all the
confusion of the blushful situation, and the bride who was
cool enough to plough through the stilted wording of a
deed, with the orange-blossoms laid out upstairs, would
be the sort of woman who would commence to snap at
her lord and master even on their honeymoon trip.
I was shown a lovely ball-dress the other day which is
foredoomed to grace Sydney School of Industry hop on
21st inst. It was like peaches and cream. The plain
front and train wore of satin brocade in a soU creamy
shade, flowered with roses, and covered all over with
peach-pink chiffon, bordered at the feet with pink and
cream roses, a cluster of which was placed on the right
hip with trails of brownish leaves. The bodice was of
pink chiffon with sleeves to the elbow of same material
caught with a “jewelled” band in “diamonds” and
“ rubies"—a girdle of pink and cream roses to finish this
pretty toilette.
Trusting agony ad. from Sydney daily;—
T>UTH.—Come back again. Tell me the plain
- L * J truth, and it will be all right. I know every-
thing.—Ll37.
And Ruth will very probably turn up with the dewy light
of innocence and good faith in her turquoise eyes and
open her coral lips and tell him exactly what she thinks
he will be most likely to swallow. After which she will
drop a tear on to his collar and wink one eye at the oat,
and the angel of perfect trust will once more hover over
the fireside of L 137. Ruth’s great trouble, I suspect, will
be to find out how much he knows. It will never do for
her to volunteer statements which may go to increase his
stock of information.
The sight of hats—rubbishy, battered hats, of forgotten
shape and battered outline—set at the door of a Sydney
shop and tightly covered with wire-netting, to prevent, I
suppose, passers-by from omitting the usual ceremony at
the counter, set me reflecting the other day on the pre-
valence of theft—not only by people who would be
tempted by the sight of an eighteenpenny top-knot, but
by the well-gilded class who can afford to pay for what-
ever it fancies. I don’t mean kleptomania when I allude
to the picking habits of the “upper ten,” which makes
confectioners keep their lollies locked up in glass-cases or
tall covered jars, while fruiterers—the easier prey—run a
wire across their windows. I have often been in a lolly-
shop when a “ carriage person ” came in, bought a six-
penny box of sweets, took a handful of cachous out of a
jar, and rustled out again with her mouth full of unpaid-
for sugar ; and the same thing occurs at swell fruiterers’.
“Oranges are just in, ma’am, three shillings a dozen,”
and after sampling one as a matter of course, and leaving
the rind on the counter, the queen-like personage
loftily disapproves of the flavour, and sails majestically to
her barouche with eighteen bananas in a bag for sixpence.
In the very best sweet-shops and the most vice-regal
green-grocers, you find padlocks, and wire-netting, and
sealed jars—all of whioh go to prove that the high-flying
customer is as prone to help herself but in an open see-me-
take-it way, to what isn’t hers, as the most professional
“ lifter” in the world.
On dit that the members of Sydney Ladies’ Club, with
Lady Innes as the moving spirit, are trying to re-estab-
lish Band Wednesdays in the Botanical Gardens —a pro-
menade function which obtained long years ago, and
which I dimly remember (I went about with a rattle in
those days) as a mob of people parading the lower lawns
while a fringe of dilapidated outcasts hung round and
passed audible criticisms on the suburban “fashion-
ables ” who minced up and down with their Sunday frocks
on. It is suggested that if Band Wednesdays are again
the fashion, Sydneyites who “receive” will do so in
the Gardens, bowing to, or howdying your acquaintances
being equivalent to spending a penitential quarter of an
hour in their plush-ridden parlours, and in that aspect
only Band Wednesday at-homes (in an Irish sense) might
become popular with those people who like to live in
front of the curtain, so to speak. But the handful of
Simon Pure Society folks will never be found handing tea
to their friends in the Botanies. Not even the exclusive
countenance of the Ladies’ Club could make such an
American innovation go beyond the ranks of those old
people who inhabit stuccoed houses and have to do every-
thing else to match.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.

On 28th ult. Miss ‘Jenny’ Marshall (daughter of the
late Dr. George Marshall, Lyons Terrace, Sydney), and
Mr. ‘Ted’ Loxton, of Neutral Bay, were indissolubly
joined together in the presence of one bridesmaid and a
compact wedding party. The bridal array was of white
chiffon over silk, white hat and feathers, the maid also
in ivory white. Dr. Hamilton Marshall gave his sister
away.
On 28th ult Miss Mary Burke, of Orange, N.S.W., ai d
Dr. George Mullins of ‘Ayenel,’ Waverley, were married at
St. Mary’s, Sydney, by Cardinal Moran. The pretty
bride wore ivory brocade and chiffon, and diamond
bracelet (the bridegroom’s thanks-offenng), her two
maids being Miss Dalton, of Orange, and Miss Wall, of
Randwick. Hobart, honeymoon.

No charge, but a grateful offering expected.
We would call readers’ attention to the
advertisement appearing on page 20 of this issue.
We can recommend it as a genuine thing. The
author. Dr. Hall, Ph.D., L.L.D., F.S.Sc., is a
man of strong and vigorous thought, well known
for his scientific work, the “Problems of Human
Life,” and some others. He has demonstrated
and proved his method by over 40 years’ personal
treatment before submitting it to the public. The
testimonials prove it to be of the widest and far-
reaohing effect.*
The Parramatta stove, ( introduced to Aus-
tralia by Messrs. Holdsworth and Macpherson, of
George-street north, Sydney, is the newest and
most highly-improved in the market. It con-
sumes either wood or coal with equal facility, as
the fire-box can be contracted or expanded when
required for either. Owing to the simplicity of
the fireplace in both top and bottom grates,
trouble in cleaning is minimised, and the use of a
drop-door is an effectual guarantee against fire.
The flue, adjusted from the front, is, therefore,
easy of access, and can be adjusted at any time
without danger of burning the hands. The use of
soot-doors obviates all tendency to smoke, and
the oven is otherwise so constructed as to ensure
quick and even heating, and the stove in all parts
is so arranged as to give the maximum of heat
at the minimum of cost through its saving of fuel.
The stove —a handsome and highly-finished
article—is produced in three patterns and five
sizes, with oven, oven and boiler, and ven, boiler
and hot closet.

“Imprudence,” the farcical comedy, by
A. W. Pinero, now running at Sydney Criterion,
betrays some signs of inexperience, but contains
more food for fun and originality than some of the
author’s later works, and one or two situations
grave enough and powerful enough for emotional
comedy. The tale is of life in a London boarding-
house, a position of great opportunity for the
study of character. Here Mrs. Brough plays,
with great gusto and finish, Mrs. Blake, the giddy
wife, whose eyes are suddenly opened to the
danger of her ways by the stupid jealousy of her
bald-headed, idiotic, and consequently doting
husband, played by Robert Brough (made up to
resemble somewhat the Rev. Charles Clark),
who spreads a report that there is a flaw
in the marriage-contract, and that he will
soon return to a state of “happy bachelor-
hood.” This calumny causes Coxe Dalrymple,
C. 8., an Indian dyspeptic, whose complexion
is yellow, and whose \vays_ are selfish, con-
temptible and grasping, admirably played and
“made-up ” by George Gordon, who filled him in a
London revival, to renounce his allegiance. His
example is followed by Captain Rattlefish, R.N.,
a cantankerous old sea-dog, well handled, though
after a slightly “Quilpy” fashion, by Arthur
Lawrence, but the enamoured young Castleton
(Frank Cates), a wealthy idiot whose engagement
with a country girl has been broken off suddenly
and who loses his estate should he not get mar-
ried before a certain day, jumps at the oppor-
tunity. He has previously, however, commis-
sioned Baines Durant, a penniless cynic (one of
the best things Cecil Ward has ever done) to
procure him a wife, and the fun in the second act
arises from the complications following on the
midnight meeting of Mrs. Blake and Castleton;
the matrimonial agent and his lady client, Miss
Dalrymple, very nicely impersonated by Brenda
Gibson. This act culminates with Brough’s clam-
bering out to confront his wife and her supposed
lover, with much crashing of plates from the
chiffonier, where he lies in wait, the screams of
“Lazenby,” the landlady (one of Miss Romer’s
clever sketches), from the cupboard where she
sleeps, and an inrush of lightly-clad boarders and
domestics. “Ted” Corlesse’s impersonation of
Doby, the broken-down waiter, in make-up, style,
and business, is particularly good, and as Mattie,
the sluttish slavey who perpetually drags her
weary legs after her, while suffering from a
perpetual head cold, caused by “sleeping
with her head under the sink,” Nellie Mor-
tyne depicts a slab of Loudon life in a
manner of which she has reason to be proud.
The first act of “ Imprudence ” is somewhat weak,
the second strong but patchy, and the third and
last, albeit devoted, as usual, to “squaring-up,”
is, notwithstanding, very bright and original.
“ Imprudence,” as played at the Sydney
Criterion, is a play of lovely “ make-ups ” and
bright acting. It should be good for a fortnight
at least. A revival of “ Turned Up ” follows, fur
which Anson will bo probably imported. After
that may come “Jane,” a screaming, farcical
comedy by Nicholls and Lestocq, now played at
London Comedy, of whioh the Australian rights,
now owned by “Bill” Holloway, have been
transferred to B. and B. through the agency of
W. J. Gates, whoever he may be. “ J ano ” is said
to bo a somewhat giddy creature.

Despite RobevtsoiTs bright music and
Royle’s local gags, Alf. James’faithful characteri-
sation of the female “haybag,” and Johnny
Sheridan’s clever acting in various parts (his
“death” when attired in kilts was the funniest
we’ve ever seen), “ Black-Eyed Sue ” didn’t take
Sydney by storm, and, judging by the houses up
to time of writing, “ Fun on the Bristol ” has, for
the nonce, worn out its popularity. “ The Widdy ”
in Johnny Sheridan’s hand, is as delightful as
ever, and some of her “gags” are new and good.
Grade Whiteford and Alf. James repeat old
successes. Dora, the part last filled here by
Lena Salinger, is now occupied by Stella
Tudor; as Bella, the black slavey, Alice
Austin succeeds Fanny Wiseman, and Henry
Imano (his facial make-up as Menaggio is a sight
to behold), succeeds Kelly. Otherwise parts arc
in much the same hands as before. Several new
songs have been introduced, but none call for
special comment, and a lantern dance by a dozen
wise virgins who await the coming of bridegrooms
with lamps alight and carefully balanced on their
topknots, takes the place of the “ Sappho ” ballet.
Mildred Trigge scores heavily and is much more
attractive —for reasons which need not be stated—
in tights than skirts. Johnny skips to Melbourne
Royal at the end of the week, when his room is
filled by the company of Achurch-Oharrington,
who open in “Masks and Faces.” A. L. Cunard,
who successfully piloted them through very cashful
times at Ballarat and Bendigo, manages for the
“ Star.” “ Our Elat,” it is said, may be put up on
the conclusion of the Achurch season, but it all
depends, you know,

Sundry alterations have vastly improved
“The Corsican Brothers” at Sydney Her
Majesty’s, The reconciliation of the houses of
Colonna and Orlandi (not Colonnas and Orlandos,
please) is very finely worked up, and the rigadoon
is a bright and well-drilled country dance. The
supernatural appearance at the close of the second
act is very clever. The wraith of Fabian, engaged
in writing to Louis, rises from the back of a settee
and blots out the dining-table and the merry
guests from view: as the spectre fades away a
tableau is shown of the duel in the forest between
Louirand Renaud at its last stage, then—sudden
darkness. In the last act the spectre is not now
reflected, but reaches the stage centre by means
of the Corsican trap, as in the first act, and the
curtain falls on him standing there in the full
rays of the limelight. The play is 'doing steady,
payable business, but the “Last Chance,” one of
G. R. Sims’ plays, reproduced in London under
another title, since re-written and now to be
reproduced, we believe, for the first time since
rehabilitation. The Messrs. MacMahon, through
the genial Joseph, have concluded arrangements
with the gentle George for llie production of
“The Country Fair,” Neil Burgess’ play, now at
the end of its fourth year of running in New
York, with the assistance of the machinery im-
ported from America for the race-seen*’, and
several performers who took part in the original
production, including Frank Courier and Miss
Stringham.

“ London Day by Day” has been scooping
in the shekels to the ascaloniau cash-box with
great regularity, and has been made the subject of
a sermon by George Walters of the Unitarian
Church. Some people rather delight in making
bricks without straw. Nevertheless, “ Bells of
Haslemere” goes up on Saturday evening for a run
of two weeks. “A Million of Money” and “The
English Rose,” probably by the bulk of the old
Melbourne cast, may follow, and at the end of the
month the Royal Comic Opera Company fill up a
month or so with “ The Gondoliers,” “Marjorie,”
and the “Old Guard.” At the end of June
Sarah Bernhardt will drop down on Sydney after
four weeks in Melbourne, opening, it is said, in
Camille,” but it is to be hoped in “ La Tosoa,”
especially if it be remembered that her Camille is,
on the authority of the — er — S.M. Herald’s critic,
inferior to that of Mrs. Jas. Brown-Potter. After-
three weeks of French hysterics, The Gaiety com-
pany come along with some Cockney jokes in
“ Ruy Bias, ”“ Carmen up to Date,” and “Joan
of Arc.” It is said that Manager Abbey pays
La Belle Bernhardt £20,000 for 10 weeks in Aus-
tralia. He intends to get it back by charging
dress circle, 155.; front stalls, 125.; centre portion,
10s. ; rear portion, 7s. Od. ; and gallery 2s. Od.
These figures are liable to be varied, but at present
that is the tariff fixed. Will he succeed ? Let us
hope so,

At Adelaide Royal, “Moths” has taken
the place of “The Idler.” So far no Australian
critic has taken exception to the bad law of the
latter play. Extradition would never be granted
on such weak evidence concerning, the result of a
drunken brawl as that brought forward by Simeon
Strong, and the strong man that Sir John
Harding is otherwise shown to be would simply
laugh at his threats. By the way, “ The Idler ”
passes into the hands of B. and B. on May 2d,
when it will be produced at Melbourne Bijou, with
Charles Cartwright and Olga Nethersole, as
before, in the lead, while Titheradge plays Sir
John Harding; Percy Lyndal, Simeon Strong;
and Mrs. Brough, Kate Merryweather. The
Adelaide season lias been extended.

At Melbourne Opera House the inde-
fatigable MacMahons'sing their praises of “ Evan-
geline ” on a sustained top-note, and that large
proportion of the population which always remains
open to conviction is in a fair way to become con-
victed by bold advertisement. After betraying
symptoms of rapid decline for two or three nights
the sacred lamp of “ romantic burlesque” was
charged with managerial oil, until, on Saturday,
it threatened to flare-up considerably. Artistically
considered, this strange medley entertainment has
little save a glittering array of glass-bead costumes
to compel special admiration, although indeed it
is handsomely decorated in all directions. A
mountain of masculine gender in “drag” is at
no time an improving study, and much careful
thinking over Eortescuefails to reveal any merit
in his performance, except that it isn’t offensive.
His hugging and maltreatment of little Gourlay
is old, old business, which lias been more humor-
ously managed by big Ben Brown and others who
discreetly black the face, instead of painting
it an inch thick. If abnormal size alone
constitutes a droll female impersonation, then
George Bonnor in Paris costumes would be a
source of everlasting mirth. Opinions differ on
such points, and so it happens that Fortescue’s
appearance makes one man laugh whilst another
(calling to mind the alleged reverence in which
Americans hold womankind) wipes away the silent
sneer—no, tear. Even the Lone Fisherman who
hangs around every scene like a chronic liver-com-
plaint is considered funny in some quarters.
There used to be an original Lone Fisherman, who
was supposed to answer to that description, and
to be the sole salvation of “Evangeline” (probably
because the character never speaks), but this his-
torical wag is either dead or has gone into the dry
goods trade, or something. It is difficult to
imagine a brand of cigarettes being christened
after the narcotic gentleman who reigns in the
other one’s stead. Gourlay does his nimble best
to make the ponderous shemale seem amusing
and Fanny Liddiard looks nice as usual. But the
new American ladies grow beautifully less on
acquaintance, while Snazelle and old favourites are
hopelessly involved all the time. A phonograph
repetition of Snazelle’s song, which represented a
shillingsworth per head at phonograph prices, has
been cut out by composer. Rice, perhaps because
he thought a machine appealing to the intellect
was out of place in a romantic burlesque which
isn’t romantic, and burlesques nothing, this
denunciation doesn’t alter the fact that “Evan-
geline ” may run, and to good business, on the
very boards where “Chilperic”—cleverly played
and sung by accomplished artists who filled suit-
able parts—was neglected on account of the weak-
ness of its story. Somebody must be entitled to
credit for the possible success in this instance, aim
only the management can claim it. Evidently the
MacMahonian method is wise in its generation,
and as Barman recently died worth a mim ol
sterling (more or less), the Opera House brethren,
being double as many as Barnura, ought to d
worth two millions between ’em.

on Saturday. George, in the character of a de-
faulting bank-manager, has overloaded himself
with fustian moralisings, and is far too persistent
in <mnding out platitudes from the centre of the
stage, but, on the other hand, he refrains from
defying the Universe in a flannel shirt until the
last act. Judicious cutting of the chief part would
leave a drama quite equal in merit to the average
British product. When performed at the Bijou
some years ago, with Maggie Knight, Nina Bouci-
cxiult, Everard and other B. and B. comedians in
the oast, “ The New Rush ” was very respectfully
received. The present performance is poor and
heavy by comparison, and a well conceived situa-
tion in the second act appears thin because there
isn’t Enough crowd to fill the larger stage. Mount-
ing is generally effective, however, and the Dar-
reflian masterpiece, which the dailies treat as being
something quite new, may run until Sheridan
commences business on the 16th.

“The Butler,” produced at Melbourne
Bijou on Saturday, is the aaine old bald-headed
family potentate, who once tried to account for a
fugitive appearance in Sydney. He has no pur-
pose in life except to pursue the cook with amorous
intentions, assault distinguished visitors with a
bolster and trample upon his benefactors. There
is a shocking lack of impetuosity about this up-
roarious tyrant, and he is made up to resemble a
cheap, dyed, fatty-degenerated edition of Lord
Jersey. In the first act he reaches the goal of his
affections by slow stages, and in the last he carries
cook off to the hymeneal altar in a one-horse ’bus,
after having spent the rest of the evening in
grabbing hold of another girl under misleading
circumstances. This other girl has a fellow who
is intended by his people for a third maiden,
the daughter of the bolstered earl, but when the
butler wobbles away with the cook, a general
collapse of parental schemes ensues, and a quan-
tity of family pride lies humbled in the dust. As
an illustration of what may happen to an over-fed
■ dictator from the kitchen, “The Butler”
deserves a week’s hard labour, with the first
three days of every alternate month in solitary
confinement. Anson fills the inflated billet as
well as the author can permit, and when Maggie
Moore arrives upon the scene, armed with a
rolling-pin, she is a rampageous burst of triumph.
Annie Taylor, Cathcart, Clitherow and Percy
Lyndal lend active support to the bloated menial
who controls the wine-cellar, but fair Miss Spong
is very fragile at present for a leading place in a
strong company. Her voice, too wants maturing
by age.

“The Lyons Courier ” was to finish at the
Alexandra on Wednesday night. On .Saturday
the new equestrian drama of wild life, entitled
“ The Scout, ” will bring Dr. Carver and his fol-
lowers behind the footlights. The cowboys are
eager for the fray, and the red-ochred children of
the vast American forest are threatening to scalp
Dampier and remove Miss Lily to their wigwams
on the Yarra bank, unless he undertakes to sup-
ply them with hot blood by the bottle. “The
Scout” is expected to make the whole welkin
shudder.

The variety halls are just about holding
their own against the marsupial slugger on the
other side of the street, the Misses Albu were to
start their tuneful lay at the Town Hall on Mon-
day, and the Exhibition Baby Show has panned
out well for the promoters. The fruits of matri-
mony were less numerous than last time, also
there was a noticeable absence of glittering “star ”
babies, but a fine general average of bulk was
attained. One very touching lesson may be
gleaned from these infant competitions, viz. that
the male Australian, boy or man, is not ashamed
to display a public interest in cradle life, or chuck
damp chins from which his British cousin would
shrink in craven terror. Whereas the typical
Melbourne virgin, having no thought for the
morrow, regards the joys of maternity with an
unwholesome giggle, and snorts at such double-
barrelled blessings as twins. Whilst Jack is
solemnly recording his vote for the treasure with
the biggest legs (and best looking mother) his sister
votes for no babies, because they are out of keep-
ing with Saturday mornings on the Block.

The Melbourne notices of “Evangeline”
throw a confusing light upon daily newspaper
criticism. The Argus said; “At the close the
curtain fell amidst enthusiasm that augurs well &c.
From the first to last the feeling of the house was
entirely with the company, and music, acting and
singing alike were applauded witli a warmth en-
tirety unusual with pieces of so light a character.”
This account of the first night’s I’eception will be
appreciated at its true value by those who were
present. Then the Age, usually kind to a fault in
dealing with MaoMahonian shows, says ; “ The
success of this work has been so pronounced in
America that its reception last night must have
been a little disappointing to the composer. Possi-
bly however ‘Evangeline’ is an acquired taste.”
iSow whilst ideas may differ upon the merits of a
theatrical performance, it is obviously impossible
tor two intelligent men to mistake a “ disappoint-
mg ’ reception for public enthusiasm and vice
versa.

“SlimV l r , om that chair was no less a personage than

the benefit of the uninitiated, it may be explained that
the “ flying-horse ” consisted of a long needle fixed with a
string running to Sadler’s working bench, and when any-
one sat on the prepared chair and “Ted” pulled the
string, the victim rose hurriedly. Sadler’s position as
leader of the “native party” at elections was unique,
and when he died he left no successor, Sadler would be
ushered into a Cabinet Minister’s room by a back door
whilst the “ biggest” in the land were waitingin the ante-
room for an audience. He was on hob-nobbing terms
with Martin and Dailey, and his bootmaker’s shop in
King-street was the daily resort of aspiring politicians.
It is odd that nobody, with sufficient time and money

Elton, according to the very latest, will stay on with
the “ Firm” awhile, and will certainly be seen in “The

triumph. In fact, he is all of it except the legs.

after the first night or two—all Spalding’s popular catch-
lines and most of his funny business.

The unkindest cut of all: A young Melbourne theatrical
critic wrote a depreciatory notice, and the sub-editor put

A collector of extra-utterances from the stage says
perhaps the most remarkable was when Shepherd, at
London Surrey, produced the “Heart of Midlothian,”
while Bouoioault’s piece on the same evening was running
at Astley’s. There was a hiss while Shepherd acted, and
he told the audience it came from emissaries of “ that
blackguard Boucicault.” Worse than Miln’s wife lectur-
ing the Melbourne audience, in Cleopatra.
Prima donna Signora Baratti was accompanied to Aus-
tralia by her grinning father, in white hair and black
beard—the make-up of Brigard, in “ Frou Frou,” and
when the act-drop was down he used to run across the
stage, with a bottle of porter under each arm, exclaiming
triumphantly, “ My daughter drink all dat!”

Edinburgh Royal under the management of the late

Toole’s best yarn, the prize one. He acted Buzfuz in
Pickwick trial scene, at Manchester, but when the curtain
went up, the jury box with its 12 men fell smack through
a trap, and the actor had his revenge, for all the stage-
carpenters were on the jury. Curtain lowered, and on its
rising again Toole complimented the jury on their
stedfastness.
The three slot phonographs shown in Sydney by Joseph
MacMahon are averaging £IOO per week. ’ Joseph, who is
rapidly recovering from the effects of his accident, has
the best records we have yet heard. One is a message
from Minnie Palmer to a Sydney lady, with a slumber-
song for nursery use. Another is a piano and xylophone
duet in which the tone of the two instruments is mar-
vellously reproduced. Another is a funny story by Gen.
Geo. Sheridan, who lectured in Australia eight years ago,
and a message of thanks for past kindnesses from him to
the people of Australia. But the dandy of the lot is the
speech of a Californian politician “broken out” by the
braying of a band, interjections, cheers, the sound of
blows and the splashing of decayed hen-fruit on his os'
frontis.

The last time the Alameda was in port Joe MaoMahon
left one of her officers in the circle at Sydney Garrick,
where “ Widow O’Brien, Esq.,” was in full blast. After
the show he picked him up and said, “Well, how did you
enjoy yourself?” The shellback, who had been “enjoy-
ing ” himself too much previously to bother about pro-
grammes, said: “ Guess I had a good time, laughed fit to
split. What pleased me more’n anything was to see
Maggie Moore again. Haint seen her for ten years ; she’s
splendid as the widdy, but, gracious, haint she run to
flesh !_” This par. will interest both Johnny Sheridan and
Maggie Moore (playing “Schoolmistress” at the “Ori.”
then), but in different ways.

A man who took part in a fight at a
Sydney boxing-hall the other night lies in a very
dangerous condition in Sydney Hospital from
concussion of the brain. He and another un-
trained, unscientific man entered the ring,
obviously for the purpose of settling a personal
dispute. The combat appears to have been a
savage one, and it will do no harm to the interests
of scientific boxing, as distinguished from brutal
slugging matches, if, in the event of Thompson
dying, all who bore a hand in the affair are
hauled up for manslaughter. If two men,
between whom there is bad blood, settle their
difference by personal combat outside a slugging-
hall, that is a clear breach of the peace, and
breaches of the peace cannot be sanctified when
they are brought off inside slugging-halls.
The yarn told about one Private O’Callag-
han of the Queensland Offence Forces, that some
wicked Unionist (unknown of course), did give him
a strychnined apple, and he did eat, to his great
subsequent discomfort, has been received with
joyous acclaim by the same daily press which
has been publishing, daily cock-and-bull accounts
of how the Unionist shearers stripped and
flogged women, and so on, up North. The
Sydney Morning Herald sententiously remarks
that the fact that the man who gave the
apple has disappeared is significant. No
less significant is the fact that up to date the
brave O’Callaghan’s story rests upon no surer
foundation than his own uncorroborated state-
ment. When a man tells a police-magistrate that
he bought a horse from a man unknown, whom
he could identify, but whom he had never seen
before or since, the P.M. doesn’t always accept
his story as gospel, but sometimes cruelly observes
that “ We have all heard such tales.” Let us, on
judicial grounds, then, postpone our unreserved
acceptance of the cobwobbly tale of the gallant
Pri vate O’Callaghan.
A Northern Territory man writes us
When you know the whole facts of the case of Rodney
Claud Spencer, who has now been conveyed to Adelaide
in irons to serve his life-imprisonment, you will, I think,
admit that there still remains a little to be said for him,
though there is no getting away from the fact that he
killed the black in a cold-blooded manner. Spencer’s
father and brother were both killed by Queensland blacks,
and he was speared three times himself. You can hardly
blame him from being anxious to deny the niggers even
the outside chance of killing the last of the family. Entre
nous, we are glad to be rid of His Excellency Governor
Kintore, and we are now speculating as to whether he
didn’t come North chiefly on business connected with
Miller’s claim and the Transcontinental Railway. The
only two places he showed any interest in were a station
of Goldsbrough, Mort & Co. and Miller’s claim. In regard
to the Territory he was stubbornly silent, and would not
enter into discussion even with the Resident upon local
matters. You know, of course, that he professes to be
reporting for the Home Government. Goldsbrough’s
people put their steamer at his disposal even before
lie left Adelaide to come up. We received him with
enthusiasm, but when we had taken his measure we
left him to scramble aboard the train (on his departure)
in the presence of three men, a dog,- and a Chinaman or
two, without a parting farewell of any kind. At his first
stopping-place up country he was presented with a sports
subscription list headed “Jersey,” £5 5s. Od. ; Hopetoun,
£5 5s, Od. ; but this didn’t fetch him for a cent. Further
inland (at the Katherine), when he was leaving the last of
our settled dist rict, the hotel flag was lowered to half-mast,
and had a pair of old breeches for company at the pole.
The popular opinion is that the overland trip is partly
one of biz. to Kintore and Dr. Stirling, who are both
reckoned to takf some interest in the Transcontinental
Railway syndicate.
According to present arrangements, John-
ston, the wretched Ballarat stock - agent, who
killed his wife and family and then attempted
suicide by poison, is to be hanged on Monday (in
a chair). Over forty leading medical men have
(up to date nnavailingly) asked the, Victorian
Government to further consider the subject of the
condemned man’s sanity. The Government view,
as disclosed in officially inspired paragraphs, is
that Johnston was no doubt quite sane when he
committed the crime, his motive for which was
fear of disgrace upon the exposure of a large for-
gery he had uttered. Now, it ill beseems anybody,
especially a judicial body, to be so cock-sure as to
the sanity of anyone who has committed a series of
apparently mad acts, and the Government’s line of
reasoning involves a sort of assumption that
Johnston being a forger should be hanged any-
how. But if the consequences of his forgery
drove him mad and egged him on to murder,
then civilisation demands that his life be
spared, just as it should.be spared if he had gone
mad through religion. So far as the world knows,
so far as the evidence available shows, Johnston
loved his wife and children most sincerely, and
that he should suddenly slaughter them all is
certainly a prima-facie proof of his insanity. The
desperate and almost successful attempt he made
to kill himself, is a still stronger proof of his mad-
ness. However, Anglo-Saxon law is a brute beast
and fifty years behind medical science. The
butchery of Johnston will not deter from sane or
insane murder any man who is fully prepared, as
the now paralysed Johnston demonstrably was, to
take his own life with his own hands.

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
It wag only a little debt for rent — a mere
bagatelle—but I couldn’t pay it. I was as insol-
vent as the Argentine Confederation. I told my
landlord—he was of the tribe of Issachar—as much,
and tried to make him understand that it was all,
owing to the fall in the price of Australian poetry,
which took place when that noble stand-by of
native bards, the wattle, went to Tasmania. He
pshawed contemptuously and said it was a pity I
hadn’t followed the wattle. From that moment 1
made up my mind not to pay him. The fact of
his wanting money from me was injury enough
without his having added insult to it. However,
he looked at the matter in a different light and got
a judgment against me. I knew what the next
step would be, and prepared for it accordingly. I
laid in—my credit being still good with the grocer
—a sufficient stock of provisions, in the shape of
flour, potatoes, tea, sugar, bacon, smoked mutton,
German sausage, and tinned fish, to last out a
three months’ siege, and then barricaded the
house and sat down tranquilly to wait for the in-
evitable bailiff. The only weak spot in my scheme
of defence was the Beer Difficulty. I couldn’t
order in a quantity, as I had done in the matter
of eatables, because —well, I had had some words
with the publican, and ray friend the grocer hadn’t
a license to sell beer. Beer I must have, of
course, in order to keep up my spirits during the
siege. There was but one way out of the dilemma
—I would have to make night-sorties with the j ug.
I had no doubt about being able to circumvent
the bailiff. It wasn’t my first experience of the
sort.

A week passed comfortably and even gaily.
Calliope—otherwise “The Muse,” my eldest
daughter—entered into the business with enthusi-
asm. She has a keen relish for humour (which she
did not inherit from her mother, who was, poor
soul, a very practical person with a superstitious
dread of debt) and saw the drollery of the situa-
tion at once. Calliope would make a charming
wife for a struggling Australian author, but I in-
tend her to marry a banker, who will never allow
Ins poor, old father-in-law to go about without a
pound or two in his pocket. This by the way,
however. She made excellent cakes and pie-
crusts from the flour I had laid in, and every day
saw a new and wonderful dish upon the table. I
never enquired as to how it was made up. The
etiquette that ruled in the garrison just then didn’t
permit of Calliope being questioned over culinary
affairs. We were very happy, she and I, in those
days of beleaguerment. Every evening as soon as
the table was cleared, Calliope took the violin and
played some dreamy after-dinner air, from one of
the great tone poets, as a gentle encouragement to
the process of digestion. I lay back on the sofa,
sucking a long cherry-wood and speculating with
luxurious malice on the chagrin the bailiff was
probably suffering from outside at the time. I
found this vein of thought especially soothing on
wet nights.
# # *
Saturday evening came. 1 had drunk
nothing but tea all that day, and every cell in
my vascular system cried out for Beer. Besides,
there was the supply for the morrow to be ob-
tained. Bailiff or no”bailiff, I would have to make
one grand sortie to the pub., and carry off as
much as they would give me for fifteenpence—my
entire capital, independent of a small sum held
by Calliope for what she called an emergency.
Whenever I wanted a drink I called that an
emergency. She didn’t, and Moses with his rod,
that brought water out of the rock, couldn’t have
struck threepence of that cash out of her for any
other purpose than that for which she intended it.
I put two large flat bottles in a bag—draught
beer is cheaper and heavier than your bottled
stuff - and started on my Dick Swiveller route to
the hotel. It was a very ingenious, crooked 1 ine
from one given point to another, but I defer
describing it till I get to my return journey. I
went into a dark side-parlour in the hotel, not
wishing to make myself conspicuous for fear of
accidents, though, so far as I knew, the Bailiff
couldn’t have known who I was unless he had
seen me coming out of ray own door. Still it was
better to be on the safe side. I was just about to
call the landlord to fill my bottles, when a figure
sprang up out of the gloom and, thrusting out a
hand, exclaimed, in hearty tones: ‘Hello, old
man, what the deuce brings you here; and how
are you, anyhow?’
I "knew the speaker at once. Only my old
comrade Jim Peters could throw such a royster-
ing ring into his voice. I shook his hand with
emotion. We had been Bohemians together in
the old days when he was a sporting ■ reporter and
I was a theatrical critic, and I was mighty glad
to see him. Holding my hand, he chanted—
‘ Though the latitude’s rather uncertain,’
I responded with —
‘ And the longitude’s equally vague,’
He added, in a rollicking baritone:
‘ The person I pity who knows not the city,’
And I concluded, hilariously :
‘ The beautiful city of Prague.’
‘ And a tiger, ’ said Peters.
‘ And a tiger,’ said I.
‘Well, God be with old times!” he remarked,
when our enthusiasm had subsided to conversation-
point. ‘ What do you drink now ?’
‘ Beer,’ I replied, gloomily, for it was a better
liquor than beer that we drank in the old days.
‘ And I, too,’ he observed, pointing to a pewter
on the table beside him; ‘I have come down in
the world since I saw you last. But to the devil
with reflection! What says Adam Lindsay
Gordon —the only poet I could ever understand—
Pass the jack !
And let us be merry to night, my men.
Ah, those were tire days when my beard was black !
I like to remember them now and then.’
* So,’ turning to the landlord, who was listening
to this rhapsody with the air of a man who was
accustvmed to all forms of delirium tremens, ‘ fill
us two ilagons of your foaming cocculus Indicus,
my festive Boniface, and let us poison ourselves at
leisure.’
# # #
‘Well,’ he said, when we had got seated
with the pewters in front of us, ‘to put it briefly,
How are things ?’
‘ None too gay,’ I answered, ‘ but I manage to
live after a fashion. And you ?’. (I wanted to
divert the conversation from myself as I didn’t
care to tell him how I was situated at the moment.
When history repeats itself too often it becomes
a bore.)
‘ Oh, don’t talk about me ,’ he exclaimed, im-
patiently, ‘ I’m not a fit subject for discussion out-
side of the Morgue, I’m a slave, body, soul and
boots, to a loathsome money-lender. D n him
and all his tribe ! ’
‘ With pleasure,’l said, ‘but how did it come
about. When I last saw you you were doing very
well on a sporting paper in Melbourne.’
‘ Yes,’ he replied, ‘I was, but they thought I was
running too free, and so one fine morning they
scratched me for future engagements.’ He laughed,
as at a humorous recollection, and continued ;
‘ You see, I was expected to provide lively sporting
gossip whether I had material for it or not, con-
sequently I was compelled to draw on my imagina-
tion a good deal of the time. One day I drew on
it a little too much. • I wrote a graphic account of
a country race meeting at which I professed to

have seen a certain prominent and pious citizen,
in disguise, laying the odds, and wound up with
a spirited picture of the time when horse-racing
and religion would go hand in hand, and every
Christian would carry his Bible to the course and
book his bets on the fly-leaf.’
‘Well?’
‘ Well, the prominent pious citizen aforesaid
happened to be a shareholder in the very paper in
which the article appeared. It got in by an
accident, of course, but I got out all the same.
After that I went rapidly down the descent to
Avernus till I came to the bottom with a dull
thud. But I see by your slippers that you live
about here. ’
I acknowledged that I did, and invited him to
come home with me and spend the evening. I
could hardly do less for old acquaintance sake :
besides, I counted on his able assistance—he used
to be a master humourist in the department of
practical joking—to help me in laying some
diabolical trap for the bailiff. I knew that it
Peters was the sort of man he was in the old days,
nothing would give him greater pleasure. But I
said nothing about the bailiff just then.
‘ I’ll go with you,’ said Peters. ‘l’m supposed
to be on business just now, but it’s a mangy sort
of business at the best, and I’ll let it slide for the
time. Allow me,' with a glance at the two flat
bottles, ‘ to provide the liquor on this occasion.’
Gf course, I replied that I couldn’t hear of such
a thing, but he insisted, and I gave in. I had
often spread the festive board for him in the past
so that neither of us had occasion to stand on
ceremony with each other. He bought two bottles
of whisky and half-a-dozen of English beer. ‘We
can polish off some of these to-night,’ he said,
‘ and there will be enough left to save you from
going out for a day or two. ’
* But,’ I exclaimed, ‘ this is absurd. We don’t
want all this liquor—l’m not going to open an
hotel.’
1 Never mind, old boy,’ he replied in his genial
way, ‘ it’s always a good thing to have liquor in
the house, and the cost of this lot won’t come
out of my pocket—at least nob ultimately. A
poor devil who lives close by will have to pay for
it in the end.’
So without more words we loaded up with the
bottles and left the hotel.
# # *
‘ You go out first, Jim,’ I said, ‘and tell
me if you see any hang-dog-looking party slouch-
ing around anywhere.’
He went out and returned in a few moments
shaking his head.
‘No,’ he observed, ‘the coast is clear. You’re
not wanted for robbing a bank, are you ?’
I smiled, but made no reply, and we arrived in
a few minutes at the lane that ran at the back of
the house in which I lived. I led the way, passing
first through a deserted cowshed, and then into a
tangle of weeds and bushes growing wild in what
had once been a garden. When we had threaded
this maze to its further side I stopped at the fence
and slid back two panels thereof, the causing of
which to run in grooves had cost me a day’s work
and several pints of beer for inspiration, not to
mention twopence for sticking-plaster to bind my
wounds withal when the job was ended.
‘ What means all this tortuosity ?’ said Peters,
when he had slipped through after me. ‘ Are you
head of a gang of coiners, or am I to be introduced
to an Anarchist Club ?’
I carefully slid the panels into their former
position, and answered with an involuntary sigh
of relief : ‘lt’s all right now, but there’s one man,
who may not be far away at this moment, who
would give something to know the secret of this
entrance. We are now in my backyard.’
I tapped at the kitchen-door, which was pre-
sently opened by Calliope.
‘ You remember Mr. Peters, my dear?’ I said.
‘l’ve asked him to spend the evening. Peters,
this is my daughter, Calliope. You recollect her,
of course ?’
‘I should think so,’ he exclaimed, heartily.
‘She used to fill my hat with beer-corks once.
Ha ! ha!’
‘Ha! ha!’ I echoed, hollowly, for I saw that
Calliope received this reminiscence somewhat
coldly. Her eyes were fixed on the bottles with
which we were loaded. She is a good girl,
but, like the rest of her sex, she doesn’t under-
stand the ways of men when they meet with
old friends. However, she made herself pleasant
when she saw that Peters was quite sober, and
ready to sit down to table with us without want-
ing the bottles opened first.
After tea we lit our pipes and made a quiet
start on the whisky.
‘Here’s a toast,’ I cried. ‘Confusion to the
man in the street!’
‘Confusion to the man in the street,’ said
Peters, draining his glass.
‘And now,’ he remarked, after we had filled up
again, ‘ here’s another toast: A short run for the
man I’m after.’
‘ A short run for the man you’re after, ’I repeated,
enthusiastically, clinking my glass against his.
‘ Who’s the man in the street?’ asked Peters,
quietly, between two puffs.
‘ Oh, a sordid ruffian—a base Bezonian,’ I
remarked—‘who’s the man you’re after?’
‘I hardly know,’ he answered, ‘but he’s a
miserable, skulking wretch, anyhow, and not
worth talking about. Do you still touch the harp
gently as of old ?’
‘ A little,’ I replied, modestly.
‘ Yes, I see,’ he observed,’ picking up a small
slip of ‘ copy ’ that lay on top of a pile of MS.
close by his elbow. ‘Hem !’ he coughed, after he
had finished reading, ‘not bad, but candidly, as
an old friend, I take the liberty of saying that I
think you’ve fallen off a lot if this is a fair sample
of the sort of verses you write now. Too much of
that cursed stuff, I suppose,’ he said, scowling
ferociously at the liquor on the table.
I acknowledged that the lines were not in my
best vein, and he seemed greatly relieved.
‘ I knew it,’ he exclaimed, ‘ you’ve wrote ’em to
order no doubt, and that’s enough to kill all in-
spiration. / found that out when I was a sporting
reporter.’
While speaking lie was turning over the pile of
MS. All at once his jaw dropped, and his eyes
began to bulge frightfully.
‘What’s the matter, old man?’ I cried in
alarm.
‘ Is—is that the name you go by now ?’ he
gasped, pointing to the signature, ‘Creeveßoe,’
at the bottom of one of my poems.
‘ Yes,’ I replied, ‘ I adopted it first as a nom dc
plume, and, afterwards, when I came to Sydney I
found it more convenient for general use than, my
real name. But what is there in this to cause
you to glower me as you are doing ? ’
He made no answer, but rose quickly, opened
the window, and thrust his head and half of his
body into the night.
‘ Stand behind me,’ he said.
I did as requested.
‘ Now, draw your right foot back as far as it
will go.’
I did so, wondering what would come next.
‘ Are you ready ? ’ he asked.
‘Yes,’ I answered.
‘ Then let fly and kick me out on my head into
the yard. Vm your Bailiff.’
‘ Wha-atV I cried, sinking helplessly into a
chair.
‘ Yes,’ he groaned, ‘kick hard and put me out
of my misery at once.’
‘Come in and shut the window,’ I murmured
feebly.
He did so and we stared at each other in silence
for several minutes. Then the humour of the
situation dawned upon us simultaneously, and we
laughed till we were both black in the face.
‘ And I called you a hang-dog-looking party—
and a sordid ruffian—and sent you out of the p-p-
-pub to 1-1-look up and down the street for your-
self,’ I stuttered in gasps between guffaws.
‘ And I said you were a —miserable, skulking
wretch—and not worth talking about,’ hiccoughed
Peters, with the tears running down his cheeks.
‘ And I’ve been dodging you for a week !’
‘ And I’ve been hunting you for a week !’
Another paroxysm.
‘ Oh, this will kill me,’ groaned Peters, ‘ and I
have some work to do to-night.’ He seized his
hat and saying ‘ I’ll be back in an hour,’ vanished
into the night.
* * #
An hour passed—an hour and a half—and
then we heard the sound of wheels, which stopped
outside our door. There was a knock at the front
door and Calliope opened it —the first time it had
been opened for eight days—and Peters rushed in
and threw a key on the table in front of me.
‘ What’s this ? ’ I enquired.
‘ Key of a new house I’ve taken for you. Van’s
outside waiting to take the furniture. There’s
going to be one sick Moses to-morrow, at any rate.’
It didn’t take us long to load the van, as every-
thing that was not in immediate use had been
packed up days before.
As we were passing out of the house, Peters
paused and whispered in my ears, ‘Shall I smash
a few windows before we go? I think it would
ease my mind a bit if I did.’
I replied that I would like to help him, only we
might attract too much attention to ourselves.
So we left the windows unsmashed, and the van
rumbled away through the moonlight, with
Calliope inside, sitting in the midst of our house-
hold goods, and Peters and I in front smoking and
talking to the driver.
That was the last I ever saw of Jim Peters, my
Surprise Bailiff.
CREEVE ROE.
“ Bruce-street, Newcastle, March 28, ’9l.
Gentlemen, —I wish to recommend your medicine
as a bicod purifier. For some time my blood has
been in a very bad condition, continually breaking
out in boils, and when I bruised the skin, I had
great difficulty in getting it healed. My liver
was also very sluggish, and I was very much
troubled with headaches. I have taken one jar
of No. 1, and nearly finished a No. 2. Beyond
freeing mo from headaches and increasing my
appetite, I felt very little benefit for the first
five weeks, and then I rapidly improved. The
boils have left off coming, my hands now quickly
heal when bruised. I have had only one slight
headache since I commenced its use, and I fee'
generally toned up all over. It appears to have
eradicated all impurities from my blood, for my
skin is now clear and of a healthy colour. I also
noticed, although the boils would not heal until
the impurities were driven from my blood, they
lost their soreness within a few days from the
time I commenced taking and applying y° ur
Microbe Killer. — I remain, yours truly, ChaelES

There is much of interest in the English

They say that a certain operatic composer
now in Australia, doesn’t know a note of music,
but just plays his melodies on the piano “ by ear,”

Charles Halle says he remembers the time

who had never earned his living) would have been

Rev. Charles Clarke denies that lie has (as

the Australian workmen as “grossly selfish.”
Well, even if he did, The Bulletin will wager
that it was not done in his showman capacity.
When G. H. Reid called Pilcher, Q.C.,
“a liar” the other day, he probably only meant
that the brilliant Q.C., was, like himself and
every other lawyer, a professional liar. We say
this for the sake of making peace between two
great and good men.
Sutton, the present Mayor of Launceston,
who was in Sydney the other day, is the man who

Fysh had gazetted.
Rastignac, Parisian journalist, hits the

Hugo’s grandson and Daudet’s daughter. “ Why

man win his own spurs, and away with reflected
glory, in a Democratic land.
The modern British aristocracy are a
commonplace lot. As a contrast, 'ook at the

to make his bed in white kid gloves. This Duke,
even when by himself, sat down to dinner clad in
his blue ribbon and Order of the Garter.

“Captain” Rose Draper, the most popular
Salvation Army officer in Australia, has been
shifted from South Melbourne to Brisbane. She
is from England, and has been a huge draw at

Randolph Churchill says that double-
barrelled names such as “ Schlater-Booth ” and
“Knatchbull-Hugessen ” always cover up a non-
entity. This rather inclines one to fight shy of
“Mark Guy Pearse” who, it would appear, must
never by any chance be mentioned save in three
barrels holy X.X.X.
The late David Buchanan once asked a
well-known N.S.W. Irish barrister how he had
got rid of his brogue as he (Dawvid) wished to
part company with his Scotch accen£. “My dear

thing; the juries only listen to you now because
they don’t understand you.”
Says Annie Besant of Charles Bradlaugh,
in the Review of Reviews :
The outward, polish that sat so gracefully on his mas-
sive frame and stately presence was foreign rather than
English. I asked him once where lie had learned his
gracious fashion, and he answered, with a half smile, half
scoff, that it was only in England that he was an outcast
from society.
Colonel P. G. Ballingall, the Ohio senator
who visited Australia lately, laden with a watch-
chain, pounds heavy, given him by the licensed
victuallers of his State, who each contributed a

Singapore. Had the lemonade-party seen the
ponderous bauble in question they would have
called it the Devil’s chain.

Even the undeserved opprobrium and the frightful
misery of a few weeks of 1885 leaves, thanks—humanly

what king-ship is like ; but 1 have won a happiness of

brother, who. since Charles’death, has been manly
?. n^ u §b to malign the Iconoclast, lias just pub-
lished “ One Hundred Answers to Infidel Objec-
tions.” He gets quite a nasty showing-up in the
P. M. Gazette, which proves that the bulk of bis
work is “lifted,” without acknowledgement,
straight out of a work published by John W. Haley,
an American divine, in 1874.
Phil. May writes concerning George
Walton, the brilliant young portrait-painter, lately
deceased, (he exhibited a “Portrait of My
Mother ” at last year’s N.S.W. Art Society’s
show) : “ I was with him about two or three days
before he died. He visited me in London, we had a
merry time, and I never saw him looking better.
I had an appointment with him for the day
before he left London, but missed him. A week
after news came of his death. ’
Eugenie didn’t like Plon-Plon. When he
wrote a pamphlet against the Orleans’ family the
Due d’Aumale challenged him. The Prince asked
the Emperor if he should go out, and Badinguet
said “No.” Next evening the Empress said to
Prince Napoleon, in the hearing of many people,
“ Cousin, a man who wants to fight does not ask
for advice about it.” Subsequently she was heard
to say: “If a bullet be ever found in Prince
Napoleon’s body it will be because he has swal-
lowed it.”
Apropos to Onslow’s Maori-named baby,
George Augustus Sala, whose knowledge of
Maori is rather weak, asserts that he met so many
chiefs in the Hot Lakes district whose names were
prefixed with “ Te,” that he used to address them
indifferently as Te Pot, Te Kettle, Tp Totum, Te
Taster, Te Fight, and Te Square. “With a
Maoi’i Te Totaler,” says he, “however, one does
not often meet.” We are here tempted to
remark that Sala is never likely to meet many
teetotallers, anywhere.
Melton “ Priah ” has been freezing the
blood of a World interviewer with accounts of
his hair-breadth escapes from death on a hundred
battle-fields. Phil. Robinson, we remember, used
to speak of “poor Melton Priah” as a hero who
mostly lay low in the hour of peril, and was a very
delicate kind of fire-eater compared with him,
Phil. But either of these two blowhards can tell
as likely yarns as the other, and on a public plat-
form they both seemed blessed with a bullet-proof
front quite in keeping with their alleged deeds of
dering-do.
The Argonaut says that Melba (she has

Sir George Verdon, General Inspector in
Australia of the E. S. & A. O. Bank, has resigned
his position on the ground of ill-health. It is not
known whether Sir George’s health has been
affected by the numerous recent heavy embezzle-
ments in the Bank’s N.S.W. business.
It is related of London Punch’s great
artist, Charles Keene, recently deceased, that he
had a theory that a healthy man ought to be able
to eat and digest anything. He himself carried
out this wild theory in the direction of all sorts of
odd combinations sausages with marmalade,
apple-tarts for breakfast, and various “little stoos,”
as he called them, concocted by himself over the.
studio fire, in a gallipot, supported on the spring
of an old gibus hat. He would minimize his lug-
gage on going to stay with a friend by putting on
four clean shirts at once, and his dress-clothes
under his morning-coat and trousers, covered by
the great redingote he always wore. He was so
thin that it made no difference in his appearance.
Here is the whole of Tennyson’s latest
poem, “To Sleep,” which brought him £5OO; —
To sleep Ito sleep! The long bright day is done,
And darkness rises from the fallen sun.
To sleep 1 to sleep!
Whate’er thy joys, they vanish with the day ;
Whnte’er thy griefs, in sleep they fade away.
To sleep 1 to sleep !
Sleep, mournful heart, and let the past he past!
Sleep, happy soul! all life will sleep at last.
To sleep! to sleep !
Now, there are plenty of men who would think
themselves well paid for twice ns much poetry
twice as good if they got three half-crowns for it.
Tennyson’s verses, had they been signed Alfred
Allen, or D. B. W. X. Sladen, wouldn't have
com man dud ten shillings in any periodical under
Heaven. •
POLITICAL
POINTS
That blunt brute, Archibald Forbes, writes
that insidious demagogy is undermining the
British Army.
W. V. Brown, polling single and plural
votes, beat Labour candidate Ogden for the
vacant Townsville seat, by 150 votes only 7.
Parkes says there is “no real opposition
to his Commonwealth Bill ! ” No real opposition
to a constitution founded on a property-vote basis !
The Queen-ridden niggers of Hawaii are
openly clamouring for a republic. These intelli-
gent darkies benefit by being a few thousand
miles nearer America than Australia is.
One evening, not so many years ago, we
heard one politician stand on a platform and call
another politician a “hoary-headed old scoun-
drel ! ” and now the pair are in the same Govern-
ment.
The feeling in Western Australia is de-
cidedly adverse to Federation on the proposed
lines. Five out of the seven W.A. delegates
oppose the scheme, and they are strongly backed
up by the people.

J. B. Patterson has told “ Colonel ”
Barker to inform “General” Booth that it will
be impossible to land a single shipload of men and
women belonging in any way to the prison-gate
brigade in any port of Australia or New Zealand.
Deakin remarks that the Federal Consti-
tution must come endorsed by the deep-toned
“aye” of the millions of this continent. It has
already been endorsed by the deep-toned “ I ” of
Parkes. Surely that is enough. If anything
further is wanted,, they might get Sir Henry’s
“ deep-toned ” I.O.U.— Mklb. Punch.
An item of special Queensland interest.
In Harpek’s Magazine for April Theodore Child
gives sketches of life in the Argentine Republic,
which, from Iris description, appears to be, in
many respects, about the worst country on the
face of the earth. “In all the centres that I
visited,” said Mr. Child, “I was struck by the
utter absence of moral restraint.”
Sir George Grey’s progress through Aus-
tralia has been a perfect triumph, lie has had a
reception such as has never been given here to any
man or woman since or before the time of Captain
Cook—such as has never been accorded to royalty
or vice-royalty. The enthusiasm evoked every-
where by his noble personality is not a tribute
alone to his bygone years of unselfish work for the
people. It is the Australian democratic declara-
tion for a republican constitution.
Albert Spicer, the rich paper-maker who
visited Australia with Dr. Dale, as a delegate
from the English Congregational body, lately
said—speaking as a candidate for the Monmouth
borough—that “the Prince of Wales taking his
place as banker at a baccarat-table, as he
is reported to have done, was striking a
heavy blow at the monarchical system.”
Rot! The king can do no wrong. All the
monarchs have been gamblers, roues' and sots for
centuries, and their faults have been always
forgiven by the priests and forgotten by the
people.
Someone pompously points out that should
N.S.W. not join the proposed Australian Federa-
tion she will lose her chance of making Sydney
the Federal Capital, which will then be fixed else-,
where by the federated provinces ; also that in
the absence of N.S.W.'s co-o]feration the other
provinces will associate in setting up a tariff
hostile to N. S. W. T hese contentions are used for
the purpose of overawing N.S.W. to swallow the
Commonwealth Bill at one gulp, without biting it.
Unless it can be showh- and it cannot be shown—
that all the other provinces are content to swallow
whole a constitution not necessarily founded from
its inception on an absolutely democratic franchise,
the arguments above quoted are not worth con-
sidering.
Townsville Herald, which fairly repre-
sents the Separationist sentiment of North
Queensland not to be confounded with the
parallel movement in Central Queensland, which,
though melting into the other over certain fringes
of contact, has a distinct impulse of its own—says
that N.Q. “ is quite willing to leave her destinies
in the more important matters of public policy in
the hands of Australia ; but it is a very different
thing to leave them in the hands of Southern
Queensland.” This means that, if Australian
Federation flags, the Separation fires are to be
rekindled in North Queensland, whether Premier
Griffith’s tripartite alternative be accepted as a
preliminary concession, or whether it be rejected
and the “whole cake” demanded at once. And
should actualities presently result from the Aus-
tralian Federation palpitations, definite schemes
of separate Statehood will be methodically formu-
lated and submitted to the new central authority.
The late U.S. census-returns show that the
white race is more than holding its own through-
out the Southern States, except in Mississippi and
South Carolina. The per centage of increase since
last returns is 23.81 white, and only 13.63 colored.
Of course the negro increase is a natural one, and
accrues solely through births exceeding deaths,
whereas the white increase is greatly artificial and
oxVing to immigration. Between 1870 and 1880
the rate of white increase in the South (we com-
pile this paragraph from elaborate statistics
printed by America) was 33.13, and the negro in-
crease 31.69. Between 1860 and 1870 the white
increase was 18.00, and the colored 9.30. In
Alabama, since last census, there is an increase of
168.611 whites and 81,328 colored people- In
Arkansas there is an increase of 224,986 whites
and 100,561 negroes; in Georgia, 156,556 whites,
138,583 negroes; in Florida, 81,856 whites, 39,988
negroes; in Louisiana, 99,758 whites, 79,238
negroes ; in North Carolina, 181,949 whites, 35,893
negroes; in Texas, 543,953 whites, 99,145 negroes;
Tennessee, 194,140 whites, 31,149 negroes. In
Arkansas and West Virginia only,-has the percent-
age of negro increase been larger than the white in-
crease during the last ten years. The respective
white and colored populations of the chief “negro”
States now stand thus: —Maryland, 824,149 whites,
218,004 colored, with a school enrolment of 167,338
white, and 37,009 colored children. Virginia,
1,014,680 whites, 649,857 colored, with 233,444
white, and 123,661 colored children at school; N.
Carolina, 1,049,191 whites, 567,170 colored, with a
school roll of 232,427 white and 120,405 colored.
Louisiana has 554,712 whites, and 562,893 colored,
with 94,417 white and 55,058 colored children at
school.
Woman.
Eight hours work, eight hours sleep, eight hours
play, that is the cry of the mechanic of to-day.
We however, have no sympathy with such cries,
we do not believe in men who want to work but
eight hours and keep their butchers, bakers,
grocers, chemists and even wives at work from
twelve to sixteen hours daily. Wives’ lives now-
,a-days are too frequently lives of drudgery ; up at
5 a.m. to get her husband’s breakfast, then
children to wash and despatch to school, then
dinner to prepare, and so on till ten at night, one
continual round of work, wash and worry. Is it
any wonder that they are prone to early decay
and premature physical decline? It is to be
expected that they would be specially susceptible
to anaemia, indigestion, liver complaint and head-
aches. Their mode of life and long hours indoors
is almost sure to induce such diseases. On account
of the duties nature has imposed upon the fair
sex, great care should be taken of their physical
health ; on the first approach of weakness or
debility of any kind, a course of Clements Tonic
should be taken. For female complaints Clements
Tonic is a specific, it regulates the several func-
tions of the organs of importance, it strengthens
the blood, nerves, heart and brain. It fortifies
the system against disease by enriching the blood
with its natural constituents to repair the waste
and loss sustained through the various changes of
condition the female life experiences. Clements
Tonic should betaken at all critical times; as it
contains the material essential to the female
physical organism, it must be effective. Of this
there is no doubt: Mrs. E. C. McCarthy, West
Maitland, N.S.W., writes: —August 19th, 1880.
Dear Mr. Clements, —I address you thus familiarly
because I consider you a brother and a friend,
although I never met you. I have suffered excru-
ciating agony from nervous toothache for years,
on and off, and could get no relief. I had seven
teeth extracted (what a wrench those dentists give
ns), one after the other, but as soon as one was
out the pain passed to another. I was given one
of your Medical Guides, and there read your
theory that toothache is often a symptom of
anaemia, and I had other signs which I found you
mentioned as being the effects of anaemic con-
ditions. I also read your boast of the wonderful
effects of Clements Tonic ; 1 was sceptical, smiled
and disbelieved, but thought a trial would do no
harm, so sent for some, and in two days—Oh! joy—
the pain was gone, I continued the Tonic, and am
cured -at last; I never expected to be, but am
grateful enough to you, and you may use this if
worth your while. And Mrs. Whalley describes
her case in these words :—Wagga Wagga, N.S.W ,
Jan. 12, 1889. Your wonderful Tonic has done
me more good than years of doctor’s treatment,
and lias restored me to perfect health. For years
I suffered from nervous debility and its Usual
string of accompanying ailments ; sometimes 1
would be despondent and melancholy, at others
wuiild have torturing neuralgia, or nervous head-
aches ; sometimes 1 would be quite worn out,
tired and weak, and unable to work. I awoke in
tlie morning with tired, aching limbs, swollen
feeling in the eyes, as if they would burst, some-
times headache and frequent nausea and vomiting
of mucous-like green matter, and various un
pleasant symptoms. Although prejudiced against
proprietary medicines, I determined to try Clements
Tonic and Dr. Fletcher’s Fills, 1 took two pills
every alternative night, and a tablespoonful of
Clements Tonic an hour before each meal-time,
and in three days 1 began to improve, and am
now quit’f well. I took seven large bottles of
Tonic and two boxes of pills ; my constipation is
quite cured, and I feel stronger and healthier than
ever before. Further evidence can be adduced to
the above which we think is conclusive.

THE ATTEMPT TO POISON A TROOPER.
There is an ugly report from the north to-day in connection
with the shearing trouble. According to the statements of ono
O’Callaglmn, a member of the Gympie Mounted Rifles, a doliberatu
attempt was made to poison him. This occurred in one of tho
streets of Barcaldine, in which town Mr. O'C. was on du y, assisting
to beep the unionists in check. An apple was, it is said, the medium
through which the poison was administered, and the perpetrator
of the diabolical act was described by the victim as a " unionist)
chap," Thu poison being strychnine, O'Callaghan suffered severely,
and showed this by the violent contortions into which ho was
thrown. His statements, too, received soi. e sort of corrolsiratioi»
from his inedical attendant, who pronoupced the patient 10 bo
suffering from strychnine poisoning.

At the R.S.Y. Squadron’s “shivoo” on
Saturday, a tough old yachtsman recommended
Governor Jersey—who turned up in a black felt
hat and talked to everybody in a very kindly and
agreeable way—to take a sea-bath every morning.
“Doit every day,” said the ancient, “ and it’ll
make a man o’you.” His Ex, somehow did not
feel much flattered at the latter portion of the
uncouth speech.
* * *
Admiral Lord Charles Scott was all right
at the R.S.Y.S. luncheon. Only one Governor
was present, so there was no trouble about elbow-
ing the chairman. Lord Chawles, however, was
dignified— i.e. , “stiff ” —enough forseveral Gover-
nors, and the rumour that he obliged the company
with “ Hi-tiddly-hi-ti-hi-ti-hi,” in character, has
no foundation in fact.
* * •*
Rev. Mark Guy Pearse, now starring Aus-
tralia on behalf of the West London mission, is
quite a swell parson. He is even lah-di-dahish
occasionally in his utterances from the lecture
platform, but is interesting and forcible neverthe-
less. In style, he reminds one somewhat of actor
Lawrence as the hunting squire in “ Impulse.”

Idyll from the South :
The Ladies Hope, sisters of Lord Hopetoun, were such
ardfent lovers of the equine species that, during one of
their recent visits to Mount Macedon, when one of their
horses was sick, each took a turn and stayed with the
animal during the long hours of the night. This would
furnish a good example to many society ladies, who
frequently go to balls and parties and leave their ailing
children to the care of hirelings.
We should like to have seen those blue-blooded,
husbandless young ladies putting the beloved
mpke’s feet in hot water and wiping his little nose
with a cambric handkerchief, and putting red
flannel on his chest in the silent watches of the
night.

A Hobart girl fainted and fell into the
arms of the piratical-looking skipper of H.M.S.
Cordelia, when the vessel was at Hobart. “ Don’t
waste your time, my dear girl,” said Grenfell;
“I am a married man.” She recovered in no
time.

They say in Melbourne that when lordly
affability, alternating with haughty frigidity, has
been metamorphosed by the impress of years into
the smirk of senility, alternating with querulous
irritability, it is the vogue to appoint the veteran
au onerous billet at £‘2ooo a year.
wnon ”to the JeWo wo sometimes go,
Why, no one makes a fuss ;
But bitter is our cry of woe
When, from the land of slaves and snow,
The Hebrews come to us.

Lady Jersey seems disposed to “ run ” the
St. John’s Ambulance Association for all it is
worth. The Association, which has useful and
noble aims, is, it would appear, one of those
things which do not flourish so long as they are
not used as pegs whereon to hang grovel. Let
Lady Jersey patronise it, and it will live and
prosper ; let her withdraw her smile and it will
fade, even as it faded socially after the departure
from these shores of the late Lady Brassey, by
whom it was created so far as Australia is con-
cerned. Your ordinary woman is, or affects to
be, afraid of a mere mouse, yet is she ready, under
the vice regal- aegis, to imbrue her dainty fingers in
the gore of the man who has had his skull bashed
m a railway-collision or a free-fight. A fine nerve-
bracer is the smile of a real Countess. The
fashionable female population of Sydney will
shortly be in a position, to go bravely forth and
emulate the heroic deed of the sympathetic
ambulance-trained girl who saw a poor man break
his leg in the street and who used her silk
umbrella and silk handkerchief to tie up the
(wrong) leg.

In a recent speech, Rev. Mark Guy Pearse
said he “ recognised that the biggest human power
for good in church work was a hearty handshake.
He stood at the door of the hall after his service
and shook hands with all who chose to do so.
There was no form or ceremony about it—not like
men going into the vestry through rows of stiff
stewards and deacons.” We are afraid that Par-
son Pearse has been getting a wrinkle from Charles
Robert, Baron Carington. As an improvement,
let us suggest that the good clergyman at his
future levees shall, while pumphandling with one
claw, hold out his hat with the other.

Lady Jersey offers a prize (a signed and
framed photograph !) for the best essay written by
any reader of the Parthenon (a Sydney periodical),
irrespective of age or sex; subject: “The Influence
of Woman,” illustrated by three characters, taken
at the writer’s choice, one from the Bible, one
from Shakespeare, and the third from any work of
George Eliot, Thackeray, or Tennyson. Competi-
tions not to exceed 2000 words in length, to be in
on or before 4th June.
A new message-boy from a Melbourne
evening paper went up to the full Bench of Judges
in the local Supreme Court, and innocently asked
if there was any “copy.” Chief-Justice Higin-
bothain, an old reporter himself, smiled kindly at
the devil’s innocence.

The forthcoming six-guinea volume about
the National Convention is to be edited by Parkes’
pet, Mr. Charles Lyne, but as it is to be produced
by a private firm, and not at the Government
Printing Office, it does not prima-facie look so
much like a job for the greater glory of “H.P.” as
usual, though the prospectus fairly reeks of “ Sir
Henry Parkes.” The book is to contain the
inevitable portraits and biographical notes, and
Lady Jersey’s alleged poem, besides the dry-as-
dust records. The names of the original sub-
scribers will be recorded in the volume, the plates
of which, after 1250 impressions have been struck
off, are to be destroyed. How many copies has the
N.S.W. Government promised to take ? In other
words, how many hundreds of pounds are the
taxpayers of hard-up N.S. Wales to be “ struck ”
for this time ?

The correspondent of an American paper
reports that “ the Prince of Wales has of late
shown marked symptoms of profound melancholia;
his nights are passed in sleepless tossing and his
waking hours in troubled meditation. He freely
expresses the belief that he will never live to
ascend the throne, and that the assassin’s bullet
will bring his career to a sudden close.” Possibly
poor old Wales is beginning to feel used up. He
has sampled pretty nearly every drink on earth,
and has looked in at a hundred thousand leg-
shows, and he has been “on the burst” in every
European city where there is a knocker to be
wrenched off or a peaceful citizen’s door-bell to
be dragged out by the roots at midnight. He has
wakened in the morning with every variety of
enlarged head known to science, and has worn all
the loud clothes ever invented till there is no
balm left in a glaring waistcoat, nor is there any
peaceful oblivion to be found in the most vociferous
pants ever built by man. He has fired at every
kind of wild animal to be discovered in Europe
and has missed them all, and even the joy of
seeing two pugilists pound each other into rags
and sausage-meat has faded and become dim.
And now, in the autumn of his years, he sits
"ADVANCE
AUSTRALIA"
drearily in his palace, and dabs sticky compounds
on his bald cranium where the hair won’t grow ;
and all his 126 pairs of pants can do nothing to
alleviate his wretchedness, and his eight-and-forty
tight boots are like a mountain on his soul, and
his six dozen gorgeous weskits fill him with un-
utterable loathing ; and though he is a free, un-
fettered heir-apparent, who can eat a whole pot of
jam every day if he wants to, and send in the bill
to the consolidated revenue, there is no happiness
left for him on all this wide earth.

Brief, unadorned cablegram from the
daily papers:
The body of a woman, terribly mutilated, has been dis-
covered in New York. The crime, in many of the aspects,
resembles those committed in London some time back,
and attributed to “ Jack the Ripper.”
I hat is the way a plain, unimaginative newspaper
man puts the fact. We no v proceed to dish up
the same statement according to the lurid fashion
of the wildly gifted Sydney Star, when that
journal is in its best form :
A ghastly crime, which, in the fiendish atrocity of its
bloodthirsty horribleness, overshadows the carnivorous
archives of history, has been perpetrated in New York.
The victim was a bright and innocent maiden aged sixteen
who was formerly the joy and ornament of a luxurious
home, but is now steeped in gore, and her golden hair has
been fished up out of a sink mingled with blood, mud, and
rats. She had been visiting the house of a friend, and left
to return home in the twilight, hut, alas, she never reached
the paternal mansion, where her aged mother now screams
for her in vain. Horrible shrieks were heard from a hack
lane, and the feet of the victim acre discovered on a mud-
shovel over in Jersey city, while her head, with the
mouth open and a look of terrrorin the beautiful blueeies,
was thrown through the window of a respectable widow
in Brooklyn. The widow fell down dead when she
saw the dreadful apparition, and hauling down the kero-
sene lamp in her fall, the house was speedily in
flames, and eighteen people were incinerated in" the
conflagration. Also the blazing ruins fell on
top of a fireman, and reduced him to ashes, all except one
leg. When his mother—who keeps a girls’ school-
heard of the awful occurrence she went mad and de-
molished all the pupils with an axe, and when the militia
arrived they were horrified to find the whole lower part
of the house filled with legs, heads, and other remains. It
was midnight before they were all shovelled away and
the dishevelled maniac arrested as she was raving behind
the heap of dead. It is difficult, amid the ghastly horror
of the scene, to sort out the human remains and keep
them separate. The troops have been called out, also the
police and the fortifications ; and the entrenchments have
been mobilised ; and everybody has been a nested exec it
the last map, who is still at large. The great heart of p
American people has buttoned itself up in its cold-meat
waistcoat with buttons of gore-spattered flesh, and has
risen to the occasion. Further developments are ex-
pected.
Later.
It is reported fhat the assassin is off his blood-stained
chump and has fled in a north-easterly direction. The
population of the country districts has taken up arms
under the impression that everybody they meet is the
criminal, and they have killed each other till hardly any-
body is left. The life-insurance companies have all busted
in consequence, and for want of male assistance the dead
are being buried by their aged grandmothers, who are
almost exhausted through incessant shovelling.
This is something like a cablegram.
Sydney D.T.’s lady-contributor deplores
that champagne-drunkenness is “on the increase
among Australian girls of the better classes.”
Anyone who even casually inspects the “ladies’
saloons ” at the city restaurants can easily see
that there are an enormous number of women
who are just as fond of drink as the worst of the
men, and that the brandy-and-soda woman is now
numbered by hundreds. She runs in all shapes ;
at one table you see her in the bulky, well-
seasoned matron of forty; at another in the
flushed girl of not much more than half that age.
Not long ago a man sat down in a restaurant near
where four girls—none of whom had apparently
seen her one-and-twentieth year—ordered, well
within twenty minutes, two brandies-and-soda
each, which they drank with case-hardened gusto.
The woman who can drink two public-house nips
of spirit and still keep her feet straight must be
“experienced.” Women have an idea that they
need “something” to “ keep them up,” and this
destructive fallacy is too often fostered by doctors,
who in these days of keen competition have to
humour their "patients in order to retain their
patronage. The doctor, afraid to tell the brutal
truth, prescribes one glass, and the woman who
has to be “kept up” takes three. Not one
woman in seven takes any exercise worthy the
name, and once she starts “ keeping herself up ”
she goes to the devil. Few women drink who
work —and it is pretty well the same with the
men.

A gay and dashing naval officer, who
nearly spliced a very-much-married little widow
at the close of last year, soon consoled himself by
making tremendous love to some “society ”ladies
in Hobart—not widows, though !
The Imperial War-office now employs an
army of female type writers, who each get 14s. a
week for seven hours’ daily work. The War-office
char-women get 12s. weekly for five hours’ daily
work. The moral is obvious.

Italics ours. From Town and Country
Journal (Sydney) :
Nell Gywnn rose from crying “ Fresh Herrings” in the

She rose ! Yes, that is Society’s creed to-day. It
is only honest work that is Disgraceful.

Dr. Edmunds, the young Bathurst medico
charged with having assaulted one of his patients,
jL married woman, was triumphantly acquitted.
The jury agreed without leaving the box, and the
J'ldfe' 6 intimated his concurrence in their verdict.
The medical profession will, no doubt, mark in an
appropriate way its sense of the wrong inflicted
upon the doctor, who appears to have been the
victim of one of those conspiracies which are some-
times unsuccessful, but just as often the reverse.
The cross-examination of the witnesses for the
prosecution by Mr. Pilcher, Q. 0., which prac-
tically decided the case, was a marvel of forensic
skill.

Even sassiety celebrities have their day.
Ihe daughter of Mrs. Cornwallis West now pro-
vides paragraphs for the papers—that same little tot
who was photographed in the act of having a pick-
a-back ride on her beautiful mother, when beauti-
ful mother was the “ beauty.’’ The Langtry Lily
lias no daughters to hand down the family tradi-
tion, and enable her to fight, as it were, old battles
oer again. So one can picture her former rival in
professional loveliness taking a private box for
Antony and Cleopatra,” using the daughter at
her side as an instrument of torture. A reminder
that another generation has come to reign, and
that the Lily is losing her last charms without
having transmitted any of the earlier and brighter
attractions to an offspring. Avery sentimental
par, don’t you think ?
* # *
1 The ungallant assertion, published in an
English fashion-paper, that Albert Edward’s wife
gets her millinery taste from her husband, is more
or loss correct. Asa matter of fact, the Princess
VV ales is the doll of her dressmakers, in whom
the deaf lady puts her full faith, receiving their
trust —sometimes for longish periods—in return.
The late “Madame,” or Mrs. White used to have
the fixing-up of England’s future queen, and in
her private room at the Regent-street shop fair
Alexandra would sit by the hour at a time and
approve the plans and sketches submitted by that
eccentric artist. A specially triumphant bodice
or a miracle in Court trains, would incite the
Princess to give Madame a diamond ring with
“her own royal hands,” a practice which she
probably follows with her present working mistress
of the robes. Conveniently deaf to the bitter cry
of the destitute, and incapable of taking much in-
terest in worthy things, or of forming intellectual
friendships, the Princess has no liberal ideas apart
from shopping. As Queen she will regard her
costumiere as the brightest jewel in the British
Crown, and, while the Crown remains the emblem
of royalty, she will be about just right.
The recent instance of an English wife
shamming to be brought to bed of a baby (as they
used to say in Charles Dickens’ time), recalls to
mind the celebrated Ironsides case of some twenty
years ago. Ironsides was a typical London soft-
goods man, ostensibly smart and “up to snuff,”
but a child was successfully foisted upon him by
his wife during one of his brief business trips to
the Continent. Somehow the soft very soft-goods
man got wind of the fraud, and his wife persisting
that the little stranger was a genuine pledge of
affection, he had to rid himself of the incubus by
legal process. Thr-n it transpired that the lady-
had specially ordered a baby with white hair and
eyelashes so as to be able to persuade the “old
man ” that he had begotten his very image.
Thereafter the demned good-natured friends of
Ironsides would dig him in the ribs and say “Now
mind, you must bring a jair one, remember.’’
About that time too, a musty legal official person-
one Sir Travers Twist, if we are not mistaken —
had a ready-made heir purchased for him by his
wife, and a lot of ensuing scandal resulted in the
Queen cancelling the lady’s presentation at court.
Being then extremely young this cancelline order
impressed ns deeply, and we marvelled that a
woman that had bowed to the Queen could possibly
exist after the aforesaid act of obeisance was
obliterated from the annals of the country. Not
so very many years ago an Australian actress
presented to her spouse an infant as per invoice at
so much per pound, but she, also, was bowled out.
Now we we want to know how many husbands
have been thus induced to dandle babes that are
not related to them in any way,
* * *
Two calamities, over and above those men-
tioned in last week’s Bulletin, were incidental
to the nuptials of a Melbourne architect. The
bride, in the act of entering her carriage, slipped
down amongst the mud and besmirched her wed-
ding garments, and the dressmaker who had pre-
pared her sacrificial robe positively gave up the
ghost on the eventful morning.
The worst enemy of justice is the Judge
who, by an unreasonable and inhumane—we may
not say inhuman—sentence, brings the law into
hatred and contempt in the eyes of the Sovereign
People. Haynes, the N.S.W. Lands Office
defaulter, a young man of hitherto excellent
character, found guilty of stealing £l6O from
Government and sentenced to eight years’ im-
prisonment (whilst men who have stolen tens of
thousands and, unlike Haynes, have never
attempted to repay a penny thereof, get trifling
terms of imprisonment and come out of gaol to
enjoy hidden fortunes), left Hay—where his wife
and family live—last week leg-ironed to a China-
man, en route to the Berrima Bastile, where, in
“solitary,” he will have speech with no human
being for nine months. The Bulletin presumes
that it is useless to appeal on such a subject to
that miserable political invertebrate, the N.S.W.
Minister of alleged Justice.

HOPES AND FEARS.
The Influenza’s coining on the briny-scented
breeze,
The horrid h’epidemic’s on the road :
A pain across the temples, and an incidental
sneeze,
Will very soon be voted d la mode.
It reaches us in packets, or in letters is conveyed,
And hawkers love to leave it at the door —
The blessings of Protection, or the follies of Free-

Don’t matter to the man who is no more,

Make your wills, prepare to face it,
Shake your comrades by the hand,
Bid them all good-bye, in' case it
Bifs you to the Better Land.
In this wicked world are many,
Many frauds we well could spare—
One end is as good as any,
Hey ! the Influenza scare.
The Influenza’s coming, and the terrible disease
Is pretty sure to decimate our ranks,
O! will it thin the numbers of our bloated
C.M.Gs.,
And wipe away the mashers at the banks ?
Will it seize un-Civil Servants whom the country
has to nurse,
Or swallow up the toilers of the realm ?
Will Capital lie conquered in an ostrich-feathered

Or Labour want an “ ulster ” made of elm? —
elm, elm, elm.
Buy your pills, prepare to meet it,
And be happy while ye may,
Like a man of mettle meet it
In a free and easy way.
Life is full of pain and sorrow,
Many loads are hard to bear ;
Here to-day and gone to-morrow—
Hey ! the Influenza scare.

Ellen Terry, Julia Neilson and other lead

under Sylvia Grey. This reads like rather uu-
remunerativo employment for Sylvia, who other-
wise makes a lot of money by coaching gawky

The bald-head in the front row is ob-
viously incurable. Recently, at a meeting of the
London County Council, some humane individual
asked if steps could not be taken to suppress the
performance of Mademoiselle Zaeo, a young and
charming trapeze female who appears at the
Aquarium, as he had learned that her back was
injured through a fall from the roof into the net?
That same afternoon a breathless member, without
a hair on the summit of his cranium, arrived at
the Aquarium, and stated that he had called to
inspect the lady’s back, in order that he might be
able to refute the assertions of his colleague, as
otherwise a deserving young woman might be pre-
vented, by uncalled-for interference, from earning
an honest livelihood. Zreo was so much stag-
gered by this unexpected incident that she
allowed her back to be inspected, and the elderly
gent, doddered away with a smile on his senile
visage. But he was hardly gone when another
baldhead arrived in a cab and wanted to inspect
the lady’s back for precisely the same reason, and
this time the patient dropped to the racket, to
quote the eloquent words of Confucius, and all he
saw was a particularly indignant father, whose
language was not choice.

The S.M. Herald lately published a

contemporary. Vide advt, in its own columns ;

nection with detectives: highest references.

one altogether omitted the police-court report,
whilst the other had the impudence to print in
full only the case of the aforesaid workman. It

According to Sydney D.T., the following
lines are engraved on the chime of bells for
Sydney’s P.O. tower :
Ring out the falsa, ring in the true,
Ring out the food of rich and poor;
Ring in redress to all mankind,
Ring out false pride in place and blood,
Ring in the common love of good.
“ Ring out the food ?” Sort of muffin-bell! By
the way, if the bells ring out the false, what will
become of politicians Parkes and O’Connor?
# # #
O’Connor, aforesaid, by the way, appears
to have so arranged matters that the big hour-bell
of the peal is to be called “ Great Parkes,” —“in
accordance with English custom,” which is a very
thin excuse, as no precedent exists, so far as the
public know, for calling a bell by a man’s sw-name.
How many more monuments do Parkes & Co.
mean to erect to their own immortal cheek during
their own lifetime? Let the world stand prepared
for the revelation that there is somewhere in the
tower a little bell with a very big clapper called
“Great O’Connor.”
# # *
“ Great Parkes !” Absurd. “ Great
Tom” of Lincoln and “Great Ben” of West-
minster we have all heard or heard of. The Sydney
P.O. hour-bell should be “ Great Dan,” as it will
never do anything except unceasingly make a
great noise, to remind people that it is over the
Post-office.

New Consumption Cuke. Extract from
Cootamundra Liberal: “A new treatment for
Tuberculosis has been tried in Paris. The patient
passes seven hours daily in a metallic chamber
into which is forced compressed air saturated with
creosote and Eucalyptol.” The above is a cable-
gram from Europe,'and we have the more pleasure
in reporting it, as it confirms what has often been
advocated in Cootamundra in the colums of the
Liberal in connection with Colemane & Sms’
unparalelled Eucalypto Extract. It has been
urged as one of the finest medicines ever discovered
for consumption. Indeed it is worth while
repeating here, with all the emphasis at our com-
m nd, that it was the discovery, made years ago,
by the senior member of the firm when he was
self-cured of consumption after certain doctors
failed, that we now owe the important industry
established so near us. From time to time Mr.
Colemane has reiterated his assertion that a pro-
per course of treatment with his pure Euoalypte
Extract must cure disease of the lungs if taken in
time. Now we have it from the most learned
medical savants of Europe, who tell us that it is
ascertained for certain—within the past few days
—that by completely saturating a man’s lungs
with the essence of the Australian Eucalyptus,
the dread tubercle, which is the destroyer of the
lungs, is itself destroyed, without the noxious
effect of the Koch poison, as deadly as that of a
black snake.
Round the Shops and Shows. *
The bargain-hunter can have a merry time
just now by spending an hour or two at the
establishment of E. Way and Co., Pitt-street.
Here can be purchased at marvellously low prices
serges and all kinds of winter material. This sale
of winter goods at the beginning of the cold
season instead of at the end, is due to the fact
that the old premises are coming down, and
in their stead a magnificent building is to
be erected, for which the plans and speci-
fications are now ready. It is therefore
necessary to sell as quickly as possible their
only recently opened winter goods, in fact in
the language of the placard “ all must he sold.'”
An opportunity is often lost through the lazy imp
procrastination, but a word ot timely warning
will perhaps cause ladies to reflect that winter is
now upon us and that there is no time like the
present to get in a stock of warm clothing.

The “ City Buffet,” which from its earliest
days has been the favourite restaurant of city
men, had but one defect —that was no room for
ladies. It needed however but a whisper into
Mr. Tollemache’s ear to have this remedied, and
now a handsome and cheerful room has been
opened where a lady can have the best of dinners
from one shilling upward. Everybody knows the
City Buffet is at corner of George and Margaret
streets, but the ladies’-room opens off George-
street.
# * *
A wonderful variety of wliite under-gar-
ments is being shown at Mrs. M'Cathie’s, No. 80
King-street. These goods are all hand-made, and
the material is chiefly the very finest longoloth,
trimmed with real torchon lace, and in some cases
with the finest Valenciennes. It is hardly conceiv-
able how anyone could make these exquisitely fine
articles by hand. Something quite novel is also
to be seen in the shapes of the garments, some of
the nightdresses, for instance, being cut to the
form and finished off by a square composed of
real lace. These goods are well worth inspecting.
Another line Mrs. M‘Cathie is showing is a large
assortment of silk underskirts. These are made
of the best silk and in the most fashionable
colours, those intended for winter wear being
lined with cashmere.
It is astonishing how very much more en-
joyable a cup of tea is when served in good china,
at all events to ladies of refined tastes. And there
is really no necessity for using the coarser ware
when a cup and saucer can be bought at Messrs.
E. T. L. Brown for one shilling. This firm has
just received 50 dozen tea and coffee cups and
saucers, which are quite novel in shape. They are
of the finest eggshell china, prettily painted, the
cups being in the form of the lotus flower, whilst
the saucers simulate the leaf. The price seems re-
diculously small for these high-class articles, but
Messrs. Browne & Oo., of 17 Hunter Street, have
had such an enormous sale that they are contented
with small profits. These cups and saucers are
c.rrefully packed in suitable boxes for transit.

'L he latest boom at Messrs. Hordern and
Company, Pitt-street, is the Neptune Serge, for
which this firm is the sole agent. By glancing
through the advertising columns of The Bulletin
old Nep. himself, the godfather of the serge, can
be seen serene and happy enveloped in the same
serge. The colour is the richest of blues, as,
indeed, the picture would show, only that printers’
ink has a trick of coming out black. But at all
events this serge is just the thing for the coming
season, and is selling at Is. 2d. per yard.

Nothing beautifies our verandahs and

shallow, in fact they are in such variety as to suit
the most fastidious tastes. There is not and never

THE FALL OF JOCK GILLESPIE.
This fell when dinner-time was done —
’Twixt the first an’ the second ruh —
That oor mon Jock cam’ hame again
To his rooms ahint the Club.
An’ syne he laughed, an’ syne he sang,
An’ syne we thocht him foil,
■An’ syne he trumped his partner's trick,
An’ garred his «•* -‘.ner rue.
Then up and spoke an elder mon,
That held the Spade its Ace —
“ God save the lad ! Whence com:s the licht
Tliat wimples on his face?”
An’ Jock he sniggered, an’ Jock he smiled,
An’ ower the card-brim wunk :
“ Pm too fresh frae the stirrup-peg,
May be that 1 am drunk.”
“ There’s whusky brewed in Galashiels,
An’ L.L.L. forbye;
lint never liquor lit the low
That keeks fra’ oot your eye.
“There's a thrid o’ hair on your dress-coat Invest,
Aboon the heart a wee ?”
“ Oh ! that is frae the lang-haired Skye
That slobbers ower me.”
“Oh ! lung-haired Skyes are lovin’ beests,
An’ terrier dogs are fair,
Hut never yet was terrier born
Wi' cll-lang gowden hair !
“ There's a smirch o’ pouther on your breest,
Below the left lappel 1”
“ Oh I that is frae my auld cigar
Whenas the stump-end fell.” ■- .
“ Mon Jock, ye smoke the Trichi coarse,
For ye are short o' cash,
An’ best Havannahs couldna leave
Sae white an’ pure an ash.
“ This nicht ye stopped a story braid,
An’ stopped it wi’ a curse —
Last month ye told that tale yoursel,
An’ capped it wi’ a worse !
“ oh ! ve’re no foil I Oh 1 we’re no fou !
Hut plainly can wo ken
Ve’re failin’ failin’ frae the hand
O’ cantie single men 1”
An’ it fell when .vfmV-shaws were s re,
An’ the nichts were lang and tnjik,
In braw new breeks, wi’ a gowdeh ring,
Our Jock gaed to the Kirk.
A NTIPODEAN CLIMATE.
MIDWINTER IN JUNE, MIDSUMMER IN DECEMBER
HAVE THEIR BANE AND ANTIDOTE.
Ihe climate of this Australasian continent of
ours, taken as a whole, is well suited to the
Europeans; it is remarkably healthy, saving
such complaints as are not generally fatal in their
tendencies, and which in a measure are more or
less common to all climates. Our climate is pecu-
liar in some respects; it is usually very dry, and
subject in summer to hot winds and periodical
droughts, and in winter to heavy rains. The
seasons are the reverse of those in England—De-
cember being midsummer and June midwinter.
But these conditions of temperature are in a
physical sense provocative of nerve troubles from
the long spells of dry weather which merge into a
long continuance of wet. In consequence, among
the minor ills which affect the flesh, we have
neuralgia, but the bane has its antidote, as the
experiences which follow will show : Mr. Alf.
Hay, of Boomanoomana, N.S.W., suffered at one
t'me terribly with neuralgia, and was curtd by
BMooi 11 ' Second Officer Wm. H. Hawes,
ir.M. b. City of New York, says; “I obtained
astonishing relief from acute neuralgia of the face
by using St. Jacobs oil. 55 Mr. W. H. Mathieson,
the well known coach-bnilder, of Dee-street,
Invercargill N.Z., says ; “An apprentice of mine
was taken ill with neuralgia, and became delirious.
m,. u ,, r , e , H ? f . frorn 0116 application of St. Jacobs
William Walker (Walker, Lemon, and
Oo.), 12, Lonsdale-street, Melbourne, writes:
1 suffeied from a severe at'ack of neuralgia—
pain intense and after—two applications of St.
Jacobs oil the pain ceased magically, and has
never returned.” The death rate of the Aus-
tralasia! colonies for 18£0 was as follows: New
Zealand, 4(1; West Australia,l3‘24 ; Queens-
and 13 59 ; Victoria, 13’70; South Australia,
14vSo ; New South Wales, 15'57 ; Tasmania, 1612.
Ihe mean of the colonies was 14'01. In England
and Wales the rate on an average of 30 years
appears to be 22'3.
BEYOND COMPETITION.
u Ahe Waterbury Watches take front rank as
“the timekeepers of the day.” They are not
“ English levers ” made in Geneva, and puffed
into notoriety to enforce sales and ensure disap-
pointment. . The factory, which is now turning
out over half a million of these watches per
annum—a production larger than that of any
other watch company in the wc rid—is still unable
to keep pace with the demand, and has now
extended its operations into the very heart of the
cheap watchmaking territory on the continent of
Europe, where it successfully competes with those
“ English levers ”on equal terms. These arc no
idle boasts, but stubborn facts, and we challenge
the refutation of these assertions. The Water-
burys (series E, J, and L) are only nickel plated
watches sold at a low figure, but they get their
reputation from live purchasers and not. the
owners of cb ad stock. They are far more reliable
timekeepers than half of the jewelled-all-over-
patent-halfcock-go-as-yon-please-hack-action-hair-
trigger - compensated - lock - stitch - burglar - baits
made in Switzerland and Germany, and sold as
English levers. The Waterbury Watches have
nothing to fear from ridicule, no dread of exposure.
They are simply what they claim to be, and defy
competition. »
These world-famed and time-tried watches may
bo obtained from any respectable dealer or store-
keeper throughout the colonies. Prices : Series
E, the old favouite, 13s Ud ; Series J, (gents’ size),
and L (ladies’ size), the new short-winding, stem-
winding, and setting marvels, 22s (id each. No
watch sold as a Waterbury is genuine without the
word Waterbury and the interwoven lettei’s
W.W.00. printed in fine type upon its dial face.

SHA
The Bogan Champion : A Lay of the
Back Blocks.
(WITH APOLOGIES TO THE ADMIRERS OF
MRS. HEMANS.)
The whaler doffed his brand-new hub
(The store had been on fire)
And sued the haughty Jaekeroo
To grant his heart’s desire :
“ I bring thee here my ration-bags,
And, 10, they are but small;
I prithee now, good overseer,
Pray fill them one and all.
“ Tor three long days and nights as well
Nought have 1 ate # or drank,
Save when I quenched my burning t:.:rst
At some foul roadside tank.
In vain for work the country round
X scour with hasty stride,
I still am doomed to swell the host
Of starving unemployed.”
Then spoke that haughty Jaekeroo,
Ilia tone was full of scorn —
(Where Yarra rolls its fragrant tide
In Melbourne he was born):
“ Thou idle thief, go seek relief
From publican or fool,
Or o’er some swinish, sleeping sot
Go run thy practised rule.
“To me in vain your fairy-tales
You spin for dust or grub—
Great Tyson ! ’twas but yesterday
I saw ye at the pub.,
And there with many an oath and shout
You gorged your fill of beer
And boasted of the cheques you’d spent
Within the present year.
“ And durst thou now with brazen brow
Of me to seek relief ?
Go, ask thy pot companions all
For damper, tea, and beef,”
The swagman spoke, his voice was low,
A frown was on his brow —
“ I go,” he said, “ ’twere vain to stay—
I seek no bloomin’ row.
“But ere I go I’d have ye know
The firm of Black and Bell
Are still alive and still they thrive
In fact, are doing well;
So when the grass is long and dry
And earth shows many a crack,
In company with Bryant they
May light me down the track.”
Then down the winding station-path
The beery bummer went,
But well the haughty Jaekeroo
Knew what that loafer meant.
Now down the river he must go
And face the winter’s rain,
But when the shearing time roils round
They’ll hear from him again.
f He had never attended State-school.
To the claims of the High Church party
that John Wesley was [a believer in apostolic
succession and baptismal regeneration, the Rev,
Wright says this reminds him of a travelling
showman who announced that he had Wesley’s
skull among his exhibits. A Methodist visiting
the show expressed a doubt as to its genuineness
on the ground that it was so small. “ I know it’s
small,” replied the showman, “ but, you see, it’s
John Wesley’s skull when he was a boy.”
A Tam worth (N.S.W.) alderman, in a
debate about the local cemetery, is reported thus :
As far as I am concerned there is not very much
religion about me— (laughter)—but I have a very great
objection that anyone who is not of my religion should
be a trustee of my burying-ground. I was brought up in
a certain religion, and, by G —, I would as soon see the
devil himself trustee over my ground as a Dissenter.
Roman Catholic or Church of England can take it as
they like. I would as soon see the devil himself trustee
where one of my children was buried, as a Dissenter, and
I hope to God that when I die they will bury me in Hell
or somewhere else.”
Dear Bulletin, —I have just kicked a dog.
Poor dog! That’s why I kicked it, I suppose.
Had it not been a poor dog it would not have beet,
lurking in my doorway as I rushed home about
1 a.m. I was sorry afterwards when I saw it
limp away, more than half-starved and hardly
able to hold itself perpendicularly on its lour legs.
If that dog had been a bit better fed it would have
turned and bitten me. Herein lies a text. In
that poor dog, half-starved, kicked and spurned, I
see the very emblem of the glorious British work-
man, kicked because he is half-starved, permitting
it for the same reason. The day will come when
the offspring of that dog will bite my posterity,
perchance. The British workman (and the Aus-
tralian workman, too, for that matter) will bite
the class that >s kicking them—in time. They are
showing their teeth in Queensland now, and the
Conservative papers are shocked apparently, but
frightened in reality. They will be hurt shortly,
unless they learn their lesson. A dog doesn t
show his teeth unless he means business. A man
is not, as a rule, reckoned lower than a dog. Ob-
servation is a grand thing. Let the monopolistic
party try it. —Yours repentantly, The Man Who
Kicked a Dog.
It is cabled that the Barings’ guarantors
now demand 15 per cent, for the use of their
names. Apropos to the Baring smash, thus a
London financial paper : —
We believe the entire fabric of England’s banking system
is 1-otten to the core, and fancy it is going to break. . .
If we are to have panic, it will, of course, be when the
horrible losses to accrue to the guarantors of the Baring
loan become public property. At first ive thought tins
loss itifoht total a million or so, but from what we now
hear we believe live millions will be the figure. OVe
reasons for thinking the directors, or some of them, of
the Bank of England think this now.)
The same paper proceeds to show that Stock
Exchange loans owe £650,000,000 of gold to de-
positors, and have a reserve of only £50,000,000 to
meet these liabilities, and says •
Our Stock Exchange system is equally rotten with our
loan-mon°-ering, and the various institutions are nothing
but huge srambling-hells. As to lawful investment
business, nobody dreams of such a thing. . . . Hie
smash will begin either when —(1) the Trust Companies,
which probably represent £50,000,000, pass their divi-
dends. (2) When the different banks tell their share-
holders that, “ owing to their heavy losses over the Baring
guarantee, they can pay no dividends, but must, on the
contrary, carry such and such sums to the debit of profit
and loss.” When this occurs there will he panic in Bank
shares, and general Hades will follow. The “ reason
why ” is simply because the financiers of England have
allowed Barings to go on and on with a system of inchoate
rottenness, lending good money to the bad Argentines,
which owing to the stupendous wisdom of Mr. Bidder-
dale, the nation, instead of an “ eminent firm” has now
to take upon its own shoulders.

STEANE’S BITTERS.
The great demand throughout the colony for
these pure Bitters shows they are superior to all
others and equalled by none.
Facts Speak Louder than Words.
Read this sworn testimony from a well-known
citizen:—
Statutory Declaration,
“I, George Hewett, do hereby solemly and
sincerely declare as follows :
“That I feel it a duty I owe to the public to
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS a day in a little water, and
I hope others suffering from the same complaint
will be as speedily cured.

ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
general depression of spirits cannot do better than
take
ROW’S STEANE’S WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
Teetotallers will find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti-febrile is unsur-
passed.

Read an expression of thankfulness received
from the undersigned :
“I have for many years been obliged to take
medicines of different kinds for affections of the
liver, indigestion, pain in the chest, general de-
bility, feeling , of nervousness, weariness, great
depression of spirits, and so on, but all without
producing any beneficial effect, till at last, being
recommended to try ROW’S DANDELION

Alfred Wheeler, well-connected, well-
educated, amiable, and with, apparently, all the
world in his favour. Alfred Wheeler, the ever-
thirsty. Alfred Wheeler, the bootless, grimy
apparition—emaciated from want of nourishment,
but-positively quaking from the previous night’s
grog —who stood in the dock of Brisbane Police
Court and begged Police Magistrate Pinnock to
send him to gaol “for pity’s sake.” Alfred
Wheeler, who was remanded that his friends
might be communicated with, but who re-appeared
bootless as before, and when told that his friends
would do nothing for him, stolidly replied, “I
knew that; send me to gaol, for God’s sake.”
Alfred Wheeler, who, the other day, hanged
himself in his cell in Brisbane gaol as the last
deliverance from the tigrous disease he was born
with and cursed with.
The Salvation Army captured a really
choice pagan the other day at Brisbane. His
name was Lue something or other, and he made
sundry surprising statements to the meeting. One
of them was that, being a humble and uninformed
believer, he had prayed that he might be able to
read, and then he had seized upon the holy volume
and found that he could read, though a minute
previously he didn’t know a comma from a patch
of grease. The meeting accepted this statement
quite cheerfully, and said “ Allylooyer ! ” Pro-
bably the most surprising feature about the Army
is the manner in which the members swallow each
other’s assertions without chawing them. If an
individual, with no more hair on his head than
there is on a gallows, tells how he was saved, and
how his thatch was miraculously restored to him
on the day when he found peace, the meeting
whoops with rejoicing, though that saved brother’s
bald head is glaring in front of them, and he
couldn’t be any balder if his whole head was taken
off. And if a rheumatic person with a fearful
cough and two wooden legs and two iron arm-
hooks tells how his health and his missing limbs
were recovered by prayer, it doesn’t matter in the
least that he hasn’t any limbs whatever. The
Army doesn’t know a discrepancy when it sees
one, and it doesn’t want to.
Kate Walls, an American authoress,
strikes some new theories on the great woman
question:—
The working woman dreads man. She knows him as
contractor, boss, night-fiend, betrayer, and wants none of
him. Why should she add to her burdens because of the
present enjoyment of finding herself courted ? She con-
siders it respectable to be married, though secretly
preferring to be a young widow with one child and a small
banking-account. If I could be engaged and let it stop
there it would do. . . . Women demand a good deal
in ability and money, and most men have not both to
give. She could get along very well if she could some-
times be married and sometimes not.
There is a lot of pathos about the picture of the
woman who wants to be sometimes married and
sometimes not.

The following testimonials from ministers, doctors, and private persons speak for them-
selves and they are but a drop in the bucket of the thousands received :
The distinguished pulpit-orator and evangelist,
Rev. Miles Grant, Boston, Mass., writes,
October 7: _ . , ,
• i *** Touching your wonderful discovery, I take muon
pleasure in saying, I am "delighted with its effects upon
my system. I sent tor it that I might know its influence
on a healthy person. I have now used it about three
months, and intend to continue its use during my mortal
life. The treatment produces a general refreshing, in-
vigorating effect; sharpens my appetite, sweetens my
sleep and makes me feel as though I had a new lease of
life I have persuaded several of my brethren of the
ministry to send for your Health-Pamphlet, and so far as
I have heard from them they are exceedingly pleased.
One of them said to me a few days ago, ‘ 1 would not
take $50 for it. It knocks the bottom out of disease.’ I
can say for myself I never spent cash to bettei advantage
than when I bought your pamphlet. r -Your brother in
Christ, Miles Grant.”
Dr, J. W. Graves, Parsons, Kansas, writes :
“Dear Dr. Hall,— After a careful reading of your
pamphlet, which came to hand a few weeks ago, I became
so delighted with the far-reaching effects of its marvellous
physiological revelations, that I at once ordered six of in}-
patients, who were suffering with consumption, to com-
mence the use of the treatment. I am happy to say that
they are all improving and doing well. You have done a
great work for afflicted humanity.—Your fraternal friend,
J. W. Graves, M.D.”
Rev. Thos. Nield, Livonia, Ind„ writes ;
“At the time I received your pamphlet on Health and
Longevity, I was suffering from internal piles. After
putting your treatment into practice three times I bade
my trouble good-bye, and have not felt it since. I have
only to add, from practical experience, during the short
time I have owned your pamphlet, that I have more faith
in your system of treatment than in all the medicines of
all the doctors on earth combined.—Yours very truly,
Xiios. Niblp. *r
Rev. A. L. Cole, D .*[)., M.D,, Santa Ana, Cal.,
sends his second endorsement of the new pain-'
phlet after another month’s practice of the treat-
ment, as follows;
“ Dear Dr. Hall,—l have nothing - to take back from
my letter as printed in the July ‘Microcosm.’ Your
treatment is the first expression of the science of thera-
peutics I have ever seen in print, or have ever put
into practice that appeals to my Judgment as unquali-
fiedly rational. It goes directly to the cause of all forms
of disease and- removes it by aiding and abetting - nature,
rather than provoking a conflict among the vital powers
as in the case of drug-medication. This I call genuine
remedial science. For nearly twenty-live years I have
been a consecutively tormented invalid, and I can say in
ail candour and truth that the first real freedom from suf-
fering that I have experienced in all this time has been
since adopting your treatment, I rejoice beyond words
within my power of expression ; and 1 honestly believe
that under God you have done more in that pamphlet
than all the doctors of the world for the relief of suffering
humanity. The treatment in my own case is to me the
wonder of wonders ! The $4 I paid for the pamphlet was
the best spent money of my whole life. Yon are at liberty
to print this, which I declare to be the literal truth upon
the honour of a man and a Christian. Cod bless you in
your beneficent work.”— A. L. Cole.
Rev. Geo. Cook, of Millicau, Texas, who was
struck with what the doctors supposed to be a
fatal paralytic shock, now sends his seventh order
for pamphlets, and writes ;
“Dear Friend, Dr. Hall,— lnclosed find the money for
three more pamphlets with pledges signed. My health is
now quite restored. Others here who have sent for the
pamphlet are just beginning to try the treatment, and
all are pleased with it. I will report further soon, and
send for a number of pamphlets.—Yours truly, Groimn
Cook.”
Let it be distinctly understood that this is no
scheme of quackery to draw money out of the
afflicted, nor is it any sort of a patent medicine
humbug, since there is not a grain of medicine of any
kind required in the treatment. Notwithstanding
this fact, it takes directly hold of the worst cases
of constipation, dyspepsia, liver complaints, head-
aches, heart disease, incipient consumption,
diabetes, and Bright’s disease of the kidneys, in-
cluding fevers and inflammation of the lungs, and
of other internal orgaqs—not by attacking these
so-called diseases directly, but by radically neutra-
lising and removing their causes, thus allowing
nature herself to do her ivork unimpeded.
We now simply repeat that the new treatment
acts so radically and fundamentally upon the vital
circulation without the least danger to the most
delicate constitution, that there is not a form of
disease that flesh is heir to, which will not be
affected favorably to the patient by an intelligent
use of this method of. treatment.
In selling this Pamphlet we are obliged to re-
require a “Pledge of Honor ” from those purchas-
ing it, not to show or reveal its contents outside
of their own families. This is for bur own protec-
tion, and as the only means by which our just
rights in the discovery can be maintained.
Doctors, of course, who purchase are not debarred
from using the treatment in their own practice,
providing they do not show the pamphlet or do not
reveal the rationale of the treatment.
Dr. J. M. Peebles, whose Sanitorium, as the
centre of his enormous medical practice, is at
Hammonton, N.J., and W'ho admittedly is one of
the most learned physicians and surgeons now
living, has sent for our pamphlet and has received
it as a physiological revelation. He writes :
“Your health pamphlet dropped in upon me like a
healing ray of sunshine. ’ I read it with'avidity, and at
once put your treatment into practice, and it is scarcely
necessary to say I found it all you recommended it to be-
am! more. It is not only pathological, physiological, and
hygienic, but rational. Already have 1 derived great
personal benefit from your discovery.—Truly yours, J.
M. I'KBBLKS, M.D."
I 111'. Peebles is a graduate of several medical colleges'
has circumnavigated the earth three times in the interests
of therapeutical and pathological science, and is the
author of eleven volumes on the subject, the last being
“How to Live a Century and Grow Old Gracefully”—a
work which we have read with profound interest. The
indorsement of our pamphlet and treatment by such a
distinguished authority surely needs no comment.]
Rev. M. Fernsler, Schafferstown, Pa., writes :
“Dr. A. Wilford Hall. Dear Sir,-Since receiving
your pamphlet I have carefully tested your treatment
upon myself. For more than twenty years I have been a
sufferer. My trouble has been torpid liver, indigestion,
pain across the kidneys, at times dizziness, 'with
occasional heart trouble, &c. With gladness unspeakable
I assure you I already find myself almost a new man ; and
1 can never pay the debt of gratitude 1 owe you for the
blessing you have conferred upon me. I want to help
spread the knowledge of this discovery, and if you will
send me'some blank Pledges of Honor I will let my
.afflicted neighbours know about the great remedy that is
in store for them. Yours very truly, M. Ff.knsi.f.r.”
DR. R. F. STEVENS’ INDORSEMENT.
Dr. Stevens, of Syracuse, N.Y., was the first
M.D. to whom we revealed the new treatment —
more than 20 years ago. In writing to a friend,
about a year ago, he gives the following :
***»«“ Nearly twenty years ago in this city Dr, A-
Wilford Hall gave me privately a detailed history of a
hygienic treatment he had discovered and adopted some
twenty years before, and which he had practised con-
tinuously upon himself up to that time. The history
included an account of the failure of the health, the
reasonings and conclusions which led him to adopt the
treatment, his rapid restoration to health, &o. From the
time of his first mention of it to me I have been entirely
satisfied that it saved him from a lingering consumption
and death ; and that in the years following, as I have evi-
dence to satisfy me, its continued practice has so affected
the nutrient and eliminating functions as to give to his
physical structure a greater degree of solidity, or, in
other words, a higher specific gravity than that possessed
by any other man living. I learn that he has persistently
continued the treatment to the present time—forty years
in all—and that his present health and vigorous condition
may rightfully be compared to the ‘ blopm of youth,’
though he is nearly seventy years of age. The tests I
have made of the treatment upon myself and in my prac-
tice in the twenty years past, have convinced me that
great practical benefit may be derived by members of the
medical profession and others from a careful study of the
rationale of the treatment as discovered by Dr. Hall, the
details of which he proposes to give in his forthcoming
book. A debt of gratitude will surely be due to him for
whatever scientific advances he may be able to unfold in
the line of assisting naturfi to ward off disease, and in the
restoration of health.- T ' F. Stevens, M.D.”
Rev. M. A. Smifr., pastor M.E. Church, South,
at McAlester, Ind. Ter., writes :
“ Inclosed please find signed pledge of Rev. W. H.
Hicks, our Congregational minister, and the money for
his pamphlet. * * * ' I am not a bit surprised to see in
the June ‘Microcosm’ the wonderful things your new
discovery is accomplishing for those who have tried the
treatment. I want to tell you with tears of joy what it
has done for my wife. For about a year she has been
regarded as a, hopeless consumptive. Our physicians had
given her up t-,3 incurable. She had patiently and reso-
lutely tried all sorts of medicines resommended by
different friends, when your pamphlet arrived. She at
once read it with me, and we became fully convinced as
to the soundness of your reasoning. Without loss of time
she proceeded to adopt your remedy,' and now what words
can I employ to express our happiness over the result '<
She commenced to improve in strength and flesh„
immediately, and so marvellous has been the change that
she now weighs as much as ever she did ! Praise God.
and thanks to you, Dr. Hall. The dark cloud has been
lifted from our sky.—Your grateful friend, M. A. Smith.
Alison C. Roe, Esq., Buchanan, Mich., writes'•
“Dear Dr. Hall,— l have received and read your won-
derful pamphlet on health and longevity. I am very
thankful that I was somewhat acquainted with your
writings, having read the ‘ Problem of Human Life ’ and
some numbers of the earlier volumes of the 1 Microcosm.
Had I not known of you through your previous dis-
coveries in science I fear I should have given little atten-
tion to this great and priceless physiological discovery
which is destined to do so much for suffering humanity-
You will hear from me again soon.—Respectfully yours,
Alison C. Roe.”

Opening of Parliament.
His Excellency the Earl of Jersey will open Par-
liament on the 19th inst., when probably one of
the most important and eventful sessions in the
history of this country will be inaugurated. The
gubernatorial speech will principally refer to the
Federation Question. The Constitution Bill
drafted at the Convention will be laid before
members, and they will be asked to decide as to
what course shall be adopted in order to consult
the wishes of the people on the subject. The most
practicable and expeditious action which may be
taken, likely to be pointed out, is to remit the
most paramount questions on the subject to a
conference of representatives specially elected for
this purpose, and the Bill, with amendments, may
afterwards be relegated to the Federal Parliament.
The vice-regal remarks will feelingly refer to this
great question of the hour, for the time has at last
become pregnant with the ideal of Federation,
which now must finally emerge from the realm of
dreams. Probably brief allusion will be made to
the introduction of a Local Government Bill, with
a view of creating municipalities who will be
invested with considerable power, and by a
judicious expenditure of money advance the
growing interests of their respective districts.
No doubt reference will be made to the intro-
duction of a new Electoral Bill, which is to
abolish plural voting and provide that the
various contests be concluded in one day. _ A brief
reference will also be made to a new Licensing
Act in contemplation, after which several salutes
will be fired, and his Excellency will formally
decree the opening of the session. The veteran
statesman, Sir Henry Parkes, will then rise and
submit to the House the following notice of
motion ; —“ As a new era is now being marked in
the history of this country by the initiation of a
Federal Constitution, it is deemed advisable, in
the interest of public health, to insist that every
householder should make a free and judicious use
of Mentiplay’s famous kidney andliverpills in order
to protect and strengthen the constitution. ” The
Hon. Dan O'Connor, P.M.G., will also table a
motion referring in eulogistic terms to Mentiplay’s
Blood Elixir—wholesale agents, Elliott Bros.,
Ld., Sydney and Brisbane ; Rcoke, Tompsett and
Co., Melbourne. The Hon. C. J, Roberts,
C.M.G., will then move that both branches of the
Legislature adjourn to the refreshment-rooms, to
which the hon. members assent with astounding
alacrity, not, however, without according an
unanimous and enthusiastic vote of thanks to the
firm of Mentiplay and Co. in recognition of their
successful researches and services rendered in the
interest of afflicted humanity. The assemblage
then disperses amidst great applause and three
cheers for Her Majesty the Queen—hurrah,
hurrah, hurrah !
Secretary Spence points out that miners
lose their health and vigour at the Broken Hill
silver-mines within five years, owing to the
presence of so much lead in the ore. If this is
so, how can their work be compensated for by
wages ?
As a hair dressing and renovator, Ayer’s Hair
Vigor is universally commended. It eradicates

Mr. Chas. E. Brown, of Megaphone Fame.
Me. Ohas. E. Bsown, one of the most popular
and best-known turf-commissioners and owner of
racehorses in the colony of Queensland, was born
at one of the digging towns in Victoria some 30
years ago, and from the time that he was able to
shift for himself followed up mining speculation
in the various colonies with no more than
ordinary success. Some six years ago he finally
settled in Queensland and, having an eye for a
well-bred horse, dealt largely in some of the best
winners that Queensland has produced. His most
successful winner was Rosebank, a fine, upstand-
ing, game, honest horse, 16 hands high, by King
of the North, from an Angler mare. Among his
most popular wins was the Brisbane Tattersall’s
Cup, 1889, which carried a money price of 700
sovs., together with a magnificent gold cup, pre-
sented by Mr. B. D, Morehead. The Brisbane
Tattersall’s, won by Rosebank, was the fastest
Queensland time on record-—H mile in 2.38 J
minutes. It is a matter worthy of note that King
Olaf, winner of the last Hawkesbury Handicap, ran
second to Rosebank in this race. Other wins to
the credit of Rosebank comprise the Central
Queensland Cup, Rockhampton, 1888, 200 so vs. ;
Port Alma Handicap, same meeting, 100 sovs. ;
as also many other races of smaller importance.
Numerous other good horses have, from to time,
graced Mr. Brown’s stables, including Lauristina,
Blue Fashion, Silvershot (hurdle racer), Clarence,
and Megaphone. The Latter horse has given
Queensland a forward name in breeding racing
stock. . Megaphone was bred by Mr. John Finnic,
Rosevale Estate, Drayton, near Towoomba, and
.was sired by Newbold horn Sound, a “nick”
which has never failed to produce winners. Meg-
aphone was purchased by Mr. Brown as a yearling
for £99 155., and was selected at Mr. Finnic’s
annual yearling sale as a probable winner, in con-
sequence of being a well-grown, strong-boned,
stout-hearted looking colt. In Mr. Brown’s hands
Megaphone’s success was almost phenomemal,
winning sixteen races as a two year old and two
races as a three year old, including the Hawkes-
bury Handicap, 1890. When Megaphone ran second
to Carbine at Randwiok, Mr. Brown was paid a
handsome premium by a well-known sporting
gentleman to have the colt placed under offer for
about half an hour until the race was decided.
Subsequent .results proved that in the Carbine-
Megaphone race it was the only time that the big
equine hero had to stretch his neck to become a
winner. It was on the strength of this race that
Mr. Donald Wallace purchased Megaphone at a
high figure. Mr. Charles Brown has a large string
of racehorses at present at work in Queensland,
and the public well know that in the hands of
“Charlie” Brown they always have a big show
for their money. Mr. Brown is a quiet , and un-
assuming man, and exceedingly popular among
all true Australian sportsmen.

Tales of Old Sydney,
No. V.—Mr. Pounce’s “Busy Day."
(FOR THE BULLETIN)
Mr. Timothy Pounce, Writing Clerk, of
Macquarie-street, Old Sydney, one beautiful
morning in October, 182-, returned from his morn-
ing stroll, which had extended as far as Windmill
Ridge, that eastern eminence which is now
covered by the dense tenements of Woolloomooloo.
A very long walk indeed it had been, one which
you would have thought should have fatigued
a man of Mr. Pounce’s years and bulky per-
son. but our venerable and worthy friend, whom
we have already introduced to Bulletin readers
(in a somewhat anachronistic fashion, because the
day of his reprieve* fell after, not before, the busy
day whose entail of work we are now about to
describe), was not in the least discomposed. He
was, on the contrary, quite comfortable, fully
exhilarated, and perfectly happy. The rapture-
breathing influences from earth and sky lifted his
nature to that pinnacle of virtue which is so often
attained when an unruffled, or, what amounts to
the same thing, a completely stifled conscience,
co-operates with a first-class digestion. For
he enjoyed, did Mr. Pounce, the enviable
advantages of a conscience void of offence
with the world and a well-organised system
for the utilisation of his gastric juices. It was a
good thing that he was blessed with good moral
and bodily health, because there was no other man
who could fill one-tenth as well his particular niche
in the social economy and industrial routine of
Old Sydney. Take his peculiar functions, and
the exquisite grace with which he performed
them, we would not in the least exaggerate if we
said that the society of the time could have better
spared a better man than Writer—and Forger—
Timothy. Therefore, it was that his well-being
was a matter of importance.
When he entered his cottage—we have already
told you it stood upon the spot, afterwards occu-
pied by that house in Lyons’ Terrace, which suc-
ceeding generations will come and stand before,
hatless and awe-stricken, because its roof once
sheltered Sir Alfred Stephen—he found in charge
of his pretty little “niece”—we are not going to
vouch for the relationship—quite a budget of
correspondence. It was a Tuesday, and the mail
from Bathurst, and the mail from the Hunter,
and the mail from Burrangorang, were all in, and
the “ niece ” had just returned from the little inn
kept by a man historically famous in the annals of
our country, which stood hard by Rapsey and
Mitchell’s store opposite the wharf. The “ pub.,”
which we will call the Horse-Tail, was the surrep-
titious post-office of the ’Maneipist and convict
population, and the niece had brought with her,
what she had gone down town for, his correspond-
ence.
V ’ 1 ' o are going to take the liberty of opening
some of the letters, and standing by Mr. Pounce
while he opens others.
* # *
The first letter which we will quote was
from Peter Somerset, transport, connected (by
doubled-irons) with the Blackheath road-gang. It
was addressed to “ Mr. Writer, at the Horse Tail
Inn, Sydney,” and had evidently come under
cover to the landlord, with the historic name, of
that comfortable and anti-Government hostelry
Please observe:—
. . 1 f' o think, mister, that you asks to much for that little
bit of bisn.es. I ain’t more than 3 stretch to doss out now
and I don’t want to run risks of bean’ copped, for if I
be lagged again it woud be for 7 stretch shure, an’ me an’
my pal don’t want nothin’ more of that sort, ’tickerly as
that woud mean Norfok—so mister you’ll ’ave to chuck
up sommat or I’ll ’op the twig (bolt) an’ dam pay any-
thing but I tells yer if yer is widen to take 20 quid an’
nag (throw in) the Gasett (Gazette), then I’m on pleas if
you quite agrees to do the fake go to Polly Summerset at
Mrs. Mashars back of the store in George-street, an’ she’s

done, now fire plees, mister, an no peachin’ or by I’ll
stouoh yer nut in soon as I’m adone the stretch, soe now

There was a business-like tone about Peter Somer-
set.
The next letter was one of a different class

You must not suppose, reader, that Mr.
Pounce’s correspondence was composed of docu-
ments of the foregoing singular description—
which was anything but singular in those days.
They were not the exceptions; they were the
rule; the exceptions were papers something like
these next following. We cannot speak positively
as to the name “Tinsley” in the first, owing to
the circumstance that salt water stains cover the
sheets we transcribe :
To Mr. Pounce, in the care of “ The Horse-Tail ” Public,
opposit the wharf, Sydney.
Hobart Town,
. Sep. 6,182-.
This is from me, Mrs. James Tinsley, an' ’opes that it
finds you in good elth as it leves me at presunt. An’ Mr.
Pounce, if it is not to much trouble will you find out were
Jack Tinsley is. You remember, sur, as how you rote
abowt 'im last yer, an’ you sed as he waz in a roader near
the wethurbord hut, blu mountins, and I prays you to goe
to Mr. Wooley wot keeps the pound an wot do mi biznus,
an I have told him to pay you 6 pounds, an you will, sur,
be soe kind has to goe to some on as you can trust an tell
ira to give my .boy Jack, you know as they call im, Luffy
Ned, an give im wot you get from Wooley, an plees,
Mister Pounce, don’t furget to give my boy Jack is
muther’s luv for he isn’t a bad boy tho’ he waz lagged
from is muther, an God Bless im an you, too, Mr. Pounce,
is the last words of me, Mrs. James Tinsley.
P.S.—An Mr. Pounce, tell Jack never to larf at prers
no mor—he used to larf at prers wen 1 read em here, an is
pore, deer father wud allwise say as he wud therby come
to a bad end. So no mor from at presunt as it leves me,
Mrs. James Tinsley. O, an, Mr. Pounce, be shure an give
Mr. Wooley, wich is name is Tomas, a recit for the muny,
as he is so verry earfull in mi acounts.
A like commission to the trusty and benevolent-
spirited Pounce was an English letter
14th March,
Holston Cottage, by Sandal Turnpike. Near Wakefield
Co. York,
Great Britain.
Dear Sir,—Understanding from my son, jwho, though
he has erred greatly, and has been a source of terrible pain
and suffering to me, is still very dear, that you can
execute a little commission for me, I beg to trouble you to
hand him the enclosed order, or, rather, as I am given to
believe that such a proceeding would be opposed to His
Majesty’s Regulations, to expend for his benefit its pro-
ceeds. When I last heard from him he was in Carter’s
Barracks, but, of course, I am in ignorance as to his
present whereabouts. The letter he sent me last was
dated in July of last year, and it bore his number—
-15577, per Hercules—and was marked : “ Examined—
E. E. S.” I give these particulars as they may enable you
to trace him. I trust, sir, implicitly to your honour, and
that you will do the best possible for my boy, over whom,
I need not say, his mother and myself grieve hourly.
You will know precisely the scope of the Regulations—
just what to do and what to leave undone, and how to
promote his comfort and his interests. I cannot say that
I could approve of any secret violation of the rules of the
Government, and, of course, I cannot learn from him
whether any expenditure on his account by you will be
permitted, but do the best for him you can, and so
earn the prayers and thanks of his grateful parents.
Transported for 14 years as ho was, it is unlikely
that I will ever see him again, and, therefore, I do
beseech him, through you, to bear in mind and follow
the counsels and warning which, I am certain, a gentle-
man in your position will only be too glad to bestow upon
the miserable boy. Is there not some form called
“ ticket-of-leave,” by which a transported offender can
secure a partial release, or partial freedom, before the
expiration of the term for which he was sent out ? Let me
know of any means by which the issue of such a form to
my son could be facilitated—of course, I mean in a strictly
legitimate way? I would only be too happy to go to a
moderate expense to effect such an end, for I have been
terribly shocked by hearing through the agency of a Mr.
Macqueen, a contributor to Blackwood’s Magazine, of the
demoralising conditions with respect to the younger
convicts for life in the penal settlements, and I saw, too,
in the Times lately, an extract from a Sydney paper
which called Norfolk Island “the Gehenna of the waters.”
I believe Norfolk Island is in Botany Bay, and I hope
there is no chance of my boy getting there. Oh, do, do
avert from him so awful a fate. lam a poor man, for I
could not allow the sufferers through his forgery to
go uncompensated, even though he himself was
under the penalty of his crime, and my money
and property nearly all went to cover the cost of
his misdeeds, but still his mother and myself would
strip ourselves of the last penny we possess, rather than
he should be thrown with felons of the deepest dye. I
say this to give you some idea what course to take’. I
must trust to you, and, therefore, sir, as you value a
parent’s blessing and thanks, give a kind word and help-
ful advice to my poor, wretched son. If you can watch
oyer him, free him from contaminating associations, put
him in the way of good companionship, his parents’
gratitude now, and his own life in the future, will, with
God’s blessing, be your reward. Waiting eagerly for your
reply,
I have the honor to be, sir,
Your very obedient servant,
Herbert Stocks, the elder.
Herewith enclosures: (1) Letter from Mrs. Herbert
Stocks to Herbert Stocks, the younger ; (2) draft payable
on demand to the order of Timothy Pounce, Esq., Syd-
ney, Port Jackson, Botany Bay, for the sum of £2O nett
sterling money, on Messrs. Stephens and Kent. Export
Merchants, Sydney. '
This letter bore, in a thin, delicate hand, a post-
script :
A mother’s best prayers will be yours, sir. for your
kindly watchfulness over her dear boy, Oh, sir, as you
hope for peace and happiness with your own children be
good to.him, be kind to him.
To this was appended the signature “Mary
Stocks,” and as though to mark it with a seal that
should command the reverence of all men, the
imprint of a tear-drop was visible on the sheet.
The spot was just over the subscription—
To Timothy Pounce, Esq., Scrivener and Law Agent
Upper Maoquarie-street, City of Sydney, Port Jackson’
Botany Bay, New Holland. ’
* * #
Yet a third class of old Pounce’s com-
munications was typified by the note which fol-
lows :
“ To X. Y. Z., in charge of Mr. Horse Tail Inn,
Sydney.
“Come round to Mr. H.’s office at once. Urgent.”
This was dated only the previous day, was unsigned
—and was on officially-headed note-paper. There
were two or three of these documents, all
addressed to “X. Y. Z,” which would go to
show that there was a tolerably good understand-
ing between Mr. Timothy Pounce, Writing Clerk,
and Forger, and the gentleman of the staff who
had access to the stock of officially-headed note-
paper.
* * *
Mr. Pounce, in years rather well forward
in the fifties, having opened his correspondence,
turned round to his “ niece ” who was sitting by
his side in the room which was at once his office
and his family sitting-room, and bestowed upon
her a chuck under the chin, which, considering
that, though the lady was enjoying the rich
maturity of “an uncertain age,” her cheeks still
bloomed, and there was a touch of love-light in
her eyes, was far more lover-like than avuncular
and remarked. “Well, Bess, dear, I’ve got a
very busy day before me.”

Oh, I’m so glad, Tim.” (We wonder how
many nieces address their uncles by their Christian
names ?) “ But will it mean the mopuses ?”
‘ ‘Why? here is £2O at once,”he said, and he
flourished gaily the draft for £2O, which had
been enclosed by Mr. Herbert Stocks.
11 Oh, you dear!” cried his “niece,” with a
movement as gay and sprightly, as she sportively
snatched the slip of paper from him ; “I must have
that for ppcket money.” She glanced at it and con-
tonued, with a tone that expressed disappointment,
Oh, it is English,—and on old Stephens ! Are
yon sure you won’t have to act on the square with
this, Tim ? It is a remittance, isn’t it, for some
pns’ner or ’Mancipist ?”
“ Tut, tut, dear, and what if it is ?”
W . el !> but, Tim, you know, you can’t deceive a
Mancipist like Peter Stephens, or Paul Kent, like
you can cheat an officer or a pris’ner ?”
“ I did think, Bess, that you had a good noddle
on you, but that remark is as stupid as ever I
heard ! For what has old Stephens or old Kent
got to do with what I do with the money after
they pay the order ? They will see it’s drawn by
their London agent, who, I’ll wager, has not the
faintest notion of the purpose for which it is sent
out. You know anybody can buy a draft on
Sydney.”
“ Why shouldn’t they know, and write to
Stephens and Kent here ?”
Because, in the first place, Bess, the purchaser
of the draft is a man who has a convict son out
here, and he wouldn’t be likely to tell the men
who sold it to him of that little fact; and, in the
second place, neither he nor they could have—ah !
—that close knowledge—ha, ha !—of—er —my
litttle peculiarities, which you have. They could
not suspect that I would—”
“Cheat?” delicately suggested the “niece,”
with a smile of charming archness.
“Hush, hush, my dear,” remonstrated the
respectable scoundrel, jocosely. “You shouldn’t
use such strong and brutal phrases—call it —er—
modify,’ my dear!”
The “niece,” carolled forth a lightsome laugh.
Ah, I won’t forget, Tim—‘modify ’ does sound
much better. Well, then, can I ‘modify’ this
draft ?”
Tim pursed up his lips, half-closed his eyes, and
looked languishing. “And, Bessie, what will
you give me for it ?” There was—oh, such an
insinuating suggestiveness in his tones.
Bessie took the hint. Still holding the paper
firmly in one of her hands, she flung her arms
gracefully and impetuously round Pounce’s neck,
and impressed a kiss, a luscious, voluptuous kiss
upon his clean-shaven cheek. “Why, that, of
course, you dear, old boy.”
Mr. Pounce, gasping neath the ardent pressure,
had still an eye to the proprieties. “Don’t say,
old boy,’ my dear, but ‘uncle.’ You must say
uncle, in season and out of season, otherwise,
you will be making a slip sometime in the presence
of others, which would be awkward.” As possibly
it might; there was an early-day regulation
which prohibited ’Mancipists forming such re-
lationships as apparently existed between “uncle”
Pounce and “ niece ” Bessie.
* * *
But amorous dalliance of this kind was
not business, and Mr. Pounce said : “This won’t
do, Bessie; this won’t do, I must get to work.
Now, dear, take a pen, and put down what I
say.
“Niece” Bessie extracted one from a neatlv-
tnmmed bundle of quills, and, seating herself at
the table, prepared to do his bidding. Thus he
bade her write :
THINGS TO DO. 12/2/10.
1. Call Mr. H., at Treasury.
2. See Mr. Woolley, re transport Jack Tinsley.
3. Call at Redman’s Keep Within Compass Inn, and give
him ten shillings, a/c the Constable at Arthur’s Yale
4. See Polly Somerset at Mrs. and tell her will
give A. P. for Pete for £2O.
5. See Lifer Withers, at Gazette Office, as to inserting
the notice of same.
6. Write Benson at General Stewart’s.
7. Write Muster-Master Stoneman, at Hobart Town.
8. Write Johnson, the Mug, to the “Scotch Thistle”
Blackheath, re Billy Hopkins.
9. Call on Mr. Mackaness, for the land-grant form, to
alter. ’
“There, Bess,” he said, “that will do ! I think
that will keep me occupied all day, without count-
ing any interviews.”
“But there is one thing,” answered the lady,
“ and that is you haven’t put down to call on
Stephens and Kent for my money for this draft. ”
-Then she had a second thought; “ Oh, no, never-
mind, endorse it now, and I will go down and get
it myself.”
“Ah, ah, you minx, wouldn’t you trust your
own Uncle?”
Again there was a form of osculation as she
rejoined; “Well, I’m afraid, you see, Tim—you
are such an expert at ‘ modifying !’ ”
** " #
The ten minutes succeeding the comple-
tion of his list of “things to be done’’—the pre-
paration of such a document was never omitted as
a preliminary to the day’s transactions, for he
was a model of method was Pounce—he devoted
to learning its contents off by heart. You can bet
your last dollar, as the then newly-originated and
still current slang ran, that Mr. Pounce did not
permit such documents to exist for more than a
very few minutes -he was too methodical for that
altogether. At the end of the ten minutes he
had perfected his memory in the list sufficiently
to enable him to repeat it exactly to his “ niece.”
“ Now,” he said, “I’m almost ready, love, for a
start. But first give me the Shakspeare,”
The girl handed him a volume, with numerous
paper marks, projecting from between the leaves.
“ Ah ! ” he exclaimed, “next to the joys of love
and home ”—he interrupted himself to once more
toss her under the chin—“nothing gives so much
satisfaction in this poor, transitory life, as a
refined literary taste. I could no more set about
my day’s work with a hope of doing it properly,
without learning a passage from Shakspeare, than
I could ”
“ Do without a kiss from me,’’said the “niece.”
Among the many fine features of Pounce’s char-
acter, there was a genuine appreciation of good
literature, and it must have been the literary
beauty of the passage, and not its significance,
which made him memorise :
His words are bonds, his oaths are oracles ;
His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate ;
His tears pure messengers sent from the heart;
His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth.
Another five minutes sufficed to get this beauti-
ful and, considering the circumstances, rather
appropriate passage committed to memory.
“Ah, now I’m ready, dear—my hat and cane,
please, and then for business ! Noble words like
those, Bess, when pondered over in the intervals
of duty, refine the mind and nourish the soul
la-ta, dear, ta-ta ; I’ll be back at one for lunch.”
» • *
Mr. Pounce’s first call was at the Treasury
—his outline of business had been carefully
framed, so that he could make his round and
attend to the several items in due order of route.
-A-h—good morning, Mr. Harrington, and
what can I have the pleasure of doing for you,
ifT?” ™' S morn * ' Exquisite morning, sir, isn’t
“Ah— l 'morning, Pounce? There is a trifle I
want you to attend to for me this morning. Hand
pretty steady to-day ?”
“Mr. Harrington, sir,” in a slightly offended
tone, responded Pounce. “You have known me
long enough to know that I never dissipate—l
have my living to earn, sir— l am not a gentleman
of the Staff.”
, Pp u^ Ge never objected to making the men of the
Civil Side the target for a satiric shot. Once he
had made himself useful to them, he was too acute
a diplomatist to resign the whip which he grasped
in his fingers.
“You are severe, Pounce,” said Harrington.
But you know I was only joking. Now to busi-
ness. Just clap the Governor’s hand and Mr.
Macleay’s to these contract-forms.”
“ Only too happy, sir !” and Mr. Harrington,
having first turned the key in the door, carefully
supervised Mr. Pounce, while, with an ingenuity
worthy of a better cause, he appended “ Ralph
Darling ” and “Alexander Macleay ” in facsimile
of the signature of each gentleman, the original
of which he carefully took from, and as carefully
returned to, a wallet in his coat-breast.
When the task was done, Mr. Harrington took
from his pocket three golden guineas, and pushed
them across the table to the hard-working and
ingenious Pounce. “ There you are, old man,” he
said, “ ’Gad, I wish I could earn money as easily
as that. A tray of guineas for 15 minutes’ mani-
pulation of the quill! You’re a genius, Pounce!”
“Well, sir,” said the gratified scrivener, “I
think I do possess rather an exceptional talent.
But—l am—er —open —er —to do —sir, I mean,
sir, I should be glad to do a little business with
you, sir, ” and, rising in his chair and leaning over
to the high dignitary of the Treasury, he whis-
pered—
“ I want a blank pa—A.P.-form, sir, and —er —
er—will take one, sir, in lieu of er—payment for
this morning’s little service.”
. A® a general rule, Pounce confined his negotia-
tions with Government officials to the gentlemen
of the particular department whose documents he
desired to utilise, but it sometimes happened that
he worked upon the friendliness of a gentleman in
one department towards an officer of another. He
would, for instance, under ordinary circum-
stances, deal direct, for blank pardons, with an
officer in the Clerk of the Council’s office, but he
had been making rather frequent applications of
late to the particular junior from whom he pur-
chased the blank forms, and as he was reluctant
to burden the willing horse, he thought that, if he
could substitute Mr. Harrington for himself as
the person who craved for the favour, he would,
while gaining his object, not impose too great a
straan upon the willingness to oblige of the Clerk’s
junior. How Mr. Harrington was to arrange it
did not trouble Pounce. That was purely a ques-
tion for the Treasury offioial himself.
It might have been two seconds —no, we will
correct any tendency to exaggeration by saying
three—that Mr. Harrington mused on Pounce’s
application. At the expiration of that stretch of
time, he unhesitatingly consented. Why shouldn’t
he, indeed ? It was a clear three guineas in his
pocket—and nothing out of the pocket of his
friend, the junior to the Clerk of the Council.
Besides, his friend might want a similar little
service rendered to himself some time or other.
right. Pounce, old man. Consider that
settled—lll have it for you to-morrow. ”
Thus was the _ first item of business transacted,
quite satisfactorily. Equally so was the second,
with respect to which he saw Woolley, the Town
pound-keeper, and collected from him the sum of
£6 which he proposed, or rather was supposed, to
apportion to the comfort of Mrs. Wooley’s son
Jack, known as “Luffy Ned,” in the surreptitious
way known to gentlemen like Mr. Pounce, in a
manner which will form a story for another time
At Redman’s Hotel, he left two dollars to be
credited to the score of Constable So-and-so at
Arthur’s Vale. These applications for tickets
were dirt cheap at the price.
Polly Somerset, house-servant, was then called
upon (by the back-way) at Mrs. Mazieni’s, and
assured that Pete could have his Absolute Pardon
with notice in the Gazette in due form, the whole
complete, for £2O. He was careful to point out to
her, was M!r, Pounce, that this rate was precisely
a third less than that he was regularly in the
habit of charging.
“ I declare to you, ’pon honour, Mrs. Somerset”
—she was 1 Mrs.” over the broomstick—“ that
never before have I given the same value for the
money. I’ve always got £3O up to the present.”
Well!” she said, “my man ain’t agoin’ to be
content with less than a habsoloot parding, an’
les he gets that he won’t ’av nothink—he will jest
make a bolt of it, so you ’ad better ’av the twenty
quid than nothink.”
“ Ah, well!” said the writing-man. “ What
must be, must; if you won’t give more, I can’t
get it. I want £5 down, Mrs. Somerset, please,
and you shall have the pardon the day after
to-morrow, and then I’ll want the rest.”
“Right it is, sir, an’ now, sir, will yer ’av jest a
drop o’ somethink to fill an ’oiler tooth whiles I
gets yer the money ?”
And Mr. Pounce, nothing loth to taste Mr
Maziere’s specially-imported liqueur, affably con-
sented.
He was the more willing to reduce his terms
for the price of a pardon, because the Absolute
Pardon form, for which he sometimes had had to
pay as nigh as a ten-pound note, was, on this
occasion, to cost him no more than fifteen minutes’
work for Mr. Harrington, of the Treasury
* * #
The Gazette office was next called at, and
Compositor Withers (lifer)-he had got into
trouble for indiscreetly remarking that Viscount
Castlereagh (him of carotid-artery-cutting fame)
should have been shot in place of Marshal Ney
—was there asked for. Withers was a gentleman
who, being foreman-overseer of the composing-
department under Mr. Howe, always attended to
Mr. Pounce’s peculiar items of patronage.
“Ah, good day,” said Pounce to Mr, Howe
proprietor of the Gazette, as he was standing in
His office doorway. “May I see your man
Withers, for a moment, sir?”
Howe was surly—didn’t like Pounce, and didn’t
mind showing his dislike, so he responded gruffly
“What the devil do you want with my man
Withers?” ’
“ Oh, sir, it doesn’t matter very much. It is
Rerdeve.”* Bullktin - A P ril 1891: “Mr. Pounce’s

only a church matter. You know Withers and I
are fellow-vestrymen at St. Phillips’, and I just
wanted to consult with him as to a little matter of
business I propose to bring before the vestry next
■week.”
“Go in,” grumped Howe. And Mr. Pounce
went in. *
“ Morning, Withers ! Just looked in to say as
there’ll be a vestry next week.” . .
“ Morning, Mr. Pounce,” responded the white
aproned Withers, who unerringly inferred from
this preliminary salutation that he was to drop
into next week’s Gazette ( nroolamation
column), under heading of I ardons or
“Tickets Granted,” particulars of a document
bestowing more or less freedom on some transport
who was fortunate enough to be in a position to
pay Mr. Pounce for a Pardon Absolute, or a
Pardon Conditional, or a Ticket. Bright
morning, sir—isn’t it? Well 111 chop round
some time to-night and discuss that little plan ot
ours.” Withers saw Howe’s head behind Bounce s
back, bent in an attitude of listening ; hence he
postponed the discovery of Pounces errand and
his visitor understood.
“ Ah, very well! See you re busy now-so just
drop round—l’ve some fresh Bengal rum, on
which I’d like your opinion as well as that Church
master.” As hospitable as moral was old Bounce.
* * *
One more call—on Mr. Mackaness, formerly
Sheriff, latterly solicitor and law-agent-and then
the writing-clerk would be at liberty to return to
residence; he had, so his assigned clerk stated,
gone to the ’Sariat stores, and so Pounce was com-
belled to return to the westward. At the Com-
missariat buildings (th« Mgyle Bonded Ware-
houses of the current year of Grace) he was so
happy as to find the gentleman of whom he was in
86 “About that land grant?” he questioned the
Mackaness as soon as he obtained a moment’s
• i foiir Vnn any j-Vipfo’ci something*
private talk. You say there s sometnmg
WF “ Well, not exactly wrong, Pounce. It’s only
that I wish the measurement restated there’s
fifty acres or so more to be included.”
‘‘And the Survey Department, sir? Have you
arranged with Mr. Flicker, sir ? ”
“Of course, of course!” rejoined Mr. Mac-
kaness, perceptibly impatient. “You think
nobody can think of anything beside yourself,
Pounce! Flicker’s allright.”
“ Ah—then I’ll go round to your office, sir, and
put the deed straight.”
And the solictor, and ex-sheriff toddled round
to his home in the respectable company of Mr.
Pounce, in order to place the latter in a position
to entitle the holder of the Grant from the Crown
of Portion No. in parish map, parish of
Marangaroo, County of Cook, Colony of New
South Wales, to claim at least fifty acres more
than even Governor Darling and the Surveyor-
General contemplated. In such matters, how-
•ver, the opinion of both these high functionaries
was of little importance once the grant was issued
if the holder of the deed could only secure the
co-operation of so faithful a law-agent as Mr.
Mackaness, so ingenious a penman as Mr. Pounce
—and so accommodating a Lands and Survey
clerk as Mr. Flicker. And not a few people, it is
to be suspected, were fortunate enough to engage
such willing and conscientious allies.
# * #
At lunch-time, Mr. Pounce was merry
and “ niece ” Bessie affectionate. She had cashed
the draft on Stephens and Kent, and while the
“ uncle” had been sampling Mrs. Maziere’s whisky
in the merchant’s kitchen, the “niece’’had been
buying a new moire-silk dress in the merchant’s
front shop. She had also made, for the dear man,
two or three evening appointments with parties
who desired to buy trifles in the way of “ tickets”
or passes, or to have their letters written, and as
this business, being remunerative, would enable
her to indulge in other luxuries, she was privileged
to be happv.
“So you spent the draft, Bess?” enquired her
“uncle,” with mock sadness, “And what’ll the
poor man do now ?”
“Rather, Tim, dear; what are you going to
do ?”
“ Oh, that’s the easiest tiling in the world. I’ll
write by the first mail to Mr. Stocks the elder,
and assure him that the money came too late to
do more than procure the best medical attendance
and comforts for his son in his last illness, and
to bury the lad decently. ’
“ But he isn’t dead, is he?”
“ What a sweet innocent ’tis, to be sure ! Why,
Bessie, love, what is easier than to kill him 1
Nothing ! Fill up a hospital-form, and a death-
report sheet from the Barrack, and there you have
ail evidence complete !”
“But Tim, in writing, don’t forget to say a
word to console the poor mother !”
“Of course, my dear, I’ll send her the truest
sympathy—‘The Lord gave aud the Lord taketh
away,’ and ‘ tempers the wind to the shorn
lamb,’ and so forth ! Trust me, Bess, that I’ll
give the dame more comfort from the news of her
scapegrace’s death than she’ll ever gain from his
life!”
* * *
A letter of condolence and a 1 vice was
written in the indicated terms that very afternoon.
We will not quote it; we shall have failed sadly
in our description of Mr. Pounce’s character if a
transcript of the letter be necessary to prove that
the composer of the “Universal Letter-writer,
Mourner’s Companion and Lover’s Vade-Mecum ”
himself would have to pale his ineffectual fires
before Pounce as an author of “offerings at the
sacred shrine of stricken sorrow.” (The phrase is
Pounce's).
Another was to Johnson the Mug, of Mount
Victoria road-gang, care of the landlord of the
Scotch Thistle Inn, Blackheath, Great Western
Road —you can see the inn from the railway-line
now under its new name of the Hydora House—
and conveyed to Johnson the Mug the news that in
a few days the writer would be able to fit him with a
new record and a new description. He did not,
naturally, tell his client how he proposed to carry
out his intention, but we will tell you the secret.
Bill Hopkins, who had been shot at Harper’s
Hill, was an old acquaintance of Pounce’s. Pounce
had a standing commission from the “Mug” to
supply him with a new identity and a new des-
cription as soon as possible, for the “ Mug ” was
a twenty-one-year man, and he a shorter
terra ; and knowing Johnson and having known
Hopkins, Pounce was prepared, for the considera-
tion of ten pounds, to resurrect Hopkins in the
other's person. The “Mug” would_ bolt—say to
the South, and would there travel with a pass in
the dead man’s name.
The third letter was to Benson, an educated
transport, at Major-General Stewart’s place,
Mount Pleasant, Bathurst. It was —but, no, it is
good enough to keep for another day.
And the last letter, penned as the shades of
night were falling around his office, and the blinds
were being drawn, and the tea was being set out
in the next room by “ niece ” Bessie’s fair hands,
was—
Sydney, October, 182—.
To the Hobart Town Muster-Master.—Sir,—l have the
honour to intimate that I have seen in the Hobart
Gazette, September issues, notice of reward for abscond-
ing female transport, Elizabeth Fawn, No. 73, ship
number per Medora; and to state that lam prepared to
point out to the police here the said transport on receipt
of assurance from your honourable self that I shall be
held free from any penalty for having innocently bartered
the said transport, and also that the advertised reward,
fifty pounds currency, shall be paid to my solicitor, John
Mackaness, Esquire, of this city, immediately the body,
dead or alive, of the said transport is delivered to the
authorities.
I have the honour to be, sir,
Your very humble servant,
B.A.L.
In care of Keep Within Compass Inn, Sydney.
* * *
Will it shock you, O Reader, to learn that
Mr. Pounce had tired of his “niece’s” affectionate
ways and extravagant tendencies, that he contem-
plated attaching himself to another “relative,”
younger and, on the surface, more charming?
We hope not, for in that contingency we will
pain you when we say that, for the sum of £5O
currency, Pounce, the pure, Pounce, the vener-
able, Pounce, the honest, was prepared to hand
over Bessie —otherwise Elizabeth Pawn, per
Medora—to the police. You couldn’t beat Old
Pounce!
PRICE WARUNG.


MERELY THE TRUTH.
They have merit.
The fact is indisputable.
The proof lies in the free samples.
It is not enough to say they sometimes fail.
They are of human produce, and therefore fallible.
The real facts are—
Do they cure diseases of the blood and skin in the majority of in-
stances ? L ndoubtedly they do. J
Do they undo the effect of a chill or congestion, by bringing about
normal conditions of health ? Yes, they loosen and disperse the Congestion.
th ,7 P ermea te the blood aseptically, so that bacilli and germs
c, nnot multiply and the growth of disease is checked ? Yes, they do.
Do they confer relief, assuage pain, and benefit the general health,
even when they do not cure ? Invariably, yes.
Do they act as a natural healthy laxative, rendering them especially
valuable to women and children, and to men of sedentary habits of life or
business ? Yes, by tonic action only.
Do they free the inner skin pores and intricacies from taint, clearing
off eruptions and improving the complexion ? They do.
Does their palatable taste and safety render them pre-eminently a
family medicine ? Yes, for neither the mind nor stomach rebels against
them, and children like them.
Are they the best of all blood purifiers and the most valuable of all
spring cleansing medicines ? Yes, they are.

Melbourne Paper.
One of the truest and most natural-looking
photos, we have ever seen is now on view in
George-street, Sydney. It represents a policeman
standing against a pillar. His left hand is thrust
in his breast, but the right hand is held palm-
upwards behind his back in the most expressive
manner possible. The man who stood for that
photo, must own at least three terraces and a
public-house.
A man who had a valuable horse that went
amiss ordered it to be sent to a vet. In a week
or two’s time he received the following bill: “ To
treatment of black horse, 50s. By carcase of
black horse, 50s. Settled.” Again, the horsey
Duchess of Montrose on one occasion received a
letter written in a sprawling hand from her
trainer: —“Your Grace. Madam —,1 have the
honor to inform your Grace that your colt by
Hermit (here the writer turned oyer the leaf)
broke his neck this morning. He dide soone. —I
have the honor to be,” &c.
Dan Mayne (Bathurst, N.S.W., Sbn-
tinkl), who descended from being a licensed pub-
lican to be the editor of a much-licensed paper, thus
moralises in his last: —
We have just heard that our once pretty barmaid,
Nellie Ryan, is dead. What a number of old men, young
men, single men, and married men were slaves to her
when she jerked beer for us in Tattersall’s Hotel. They
came miles to get a smile from Nellie. Where we last
saw her was in Sydney, lying back by herself in a crack
private carriage, drawn by a beautiful pair of bays, and
driven by a coachman in full livery. She was evidently
in honey. We hear her death was a sudden one, and the
stone over her grave simply says, “Nellie Ryan.” Peace
to your ashes, Nellie.
A certain worthy dame, who, somewhat
unjustly, refused to believe that her husband
spent so many evenings at church vestry-
meetings, put on her oldest shawl and the cook’s
bonnet one night and followed him. Through the
murmuring pines and hemlocks in the wood of St.
John she dogged his footsteps, and, when she saw
him enter the Bijou Villa, she sat upon a kerb to
mentally fix up a cross-examination, but so long
did he keep her waiting that fell pneumonia got
in its giddy work, and her last remarks, vide the
plate on her coffin, were : —“ This should be a
warning to wives to stay at home o’ nights and
keep the oat company.”—Pink Un.
“On and from the 10th inst., the post
and telephone office known as ‘ Spencer’s Greek
will bear the designation of ‘ Jerseyville.’—
(Signed) Daniel O’Connob.” More rotworry.
Judge Windeyer thus artistically coerced
a Tamworth (N.S.W.) jury the other day : I
hope the jury will return a verdict without leaving
the box. I know what you want to leave the box
for —in order not to serve on the next jury, but I
can lock you up until the end of the next case.”
Verdict o*f guilty from the jury-box. “Now,”
humorously remarked his Honor, “now you can
go, but you will have to take your chance about
serving on the next jury.” We would like to
hear the comments of the prisoner, who, by the
way, was a Chinaman, in his own language, if he
understood this little judicial pleasantry.
At Ipswich (Q.) District Court. Defend-
ing Barrister; “ If your Honor pleases, you have

(dryly interrupting): “Perhaps so; but I am

The floods in North and West Queensland
are a vivid contrast to the pastoral horrors of the
big drought that ended in the Northern province
about two years ago. Amongst other yarns
recalled of that period is that of the verbal repiprt
of Sergeant Boyce, who exclaimed to his superior
officer, after a lengthened tour around the back
country ; Son% it’i ft ba<i state the Warrego
country is in entoirely. Those back creeks are
shwarmin’ alive wid dead shtock, and _ siveral
bushmen have doied wid the wather-famme this
year who never doied before.”
A N.Z. Civil Service masher lately gave
himself a holiday in a district sparsely inhabited
by Maoris. The day was hot, and a secluded
pool tempted the man from Napier to bathe.
Before dressing after his ablution he took a run
on the grass, and sat down at the foot of a tree
some distance from his clothes. Then he found
himself suddenly surrounded by a large number
of hungry-looking wild pigs, all seemingly eager
to make a meal of him. Quick as lightning he
shinned up the tree and saved himself from being
converted into bacon. He waited for the pigs to
go away, and they waited for him to come down
and be assimilated. After a weary wait of two
hours an old Maori came and drove the pigs away,
and then he saw that they were quite tame. W hen
he got back to the place where he had left his
clothes he found they were gone, finally, he
borrowed a blanket from the Maori.
A characteristic story of rough-and-ready
diggings justice. On the Starcke, N.Q.,
police-courts and beaks are unknown, on 19th
March, a miner known as Mac. accused two other
diggers, Medley and Knapp, of having stolen from
him 5oz. of gold, asserting that his “plant -bag
had contained 31b. weight of the precious dust,
whereas it now only showed 21b. 7oz. A gong-
rattling (camp-oven) roll-up was summoned, and
about fifty miners answered the call. A court
was improvised, evidence was carefully taken,
and the verdict arrived at was that Mac. was a
jumped-up prevaricator, and that he never had
placed 31b. weight of gold in the bag in
question. Sentence was passed in this form:
“That Mac. quit this field within 24 hours, or
stand the consequences; and that, in the mean-
time, Mac.’s claim be sold by auction and the
proceeds handed to him.” The claim fetched £5,
and Mac. “ got.”
The prisoner sat in his murky cell and glared at
the prison stew, ,
And he looked on the pie with a gloomy eye, and
scoffed at the gaol ragout, , ,
And the Government cash which bought the hash
that was boiled for that homicide
From day to day was all thrown away, for he let
his provisions slide.
And the tale thus ran of that wild black man :
“ I like not your ways of blood,
And I will not die on your gallows high, and come
down with that strange, dull thud,
That your inky men will write about when they
gather at break of day, , . ,
That each dismal ghoul may be there to fool with
my inanimate clay.
“I hate the grin of your preacher thin who
haunts this whitewashed cell, ,
And the rope that leads to the blazing slope of
your endless Christian hell;
And the wooden floor of that strange trap-door,
that opens and lets you go . ,
Like a vanished clown who goes rushing down
with all Gehenna below.
“ And the ways are black in that murky track
where the white man’s devil is,
Where Ins horny tail leaves a slimy trail, and nis
leathern pinions whiz ;
And the dismal beat of his cloven feet, and his
trackless wastes of hide,
They fill the gloom of the Christian s tomb, and
o’erspread the night-land wide.
“ And no bottom is there in that realm of air of
which your preachers tell,
But a ceaseless fall through each infinite hall of
the Christian’s boundless hell,
And an arrowy flight through the wastes of iNight
—a flight o’er a sunless sea,
When the strange, dull thud of your man of blood
has opened eternity.
“ And your inky men of the lying pen will fool
with the dust of me,
When formless things on vampire wings are bear-
ing me company ; , . . ,
And over the woof of the midnight s roof that host
of the lost and dead, ,
Silent and fleet, on their boneless feet, through
the realms of space will tread.
“ I loathe the guile of your hangman’s smile, and
his fingers gaunt and cold,
And the greasy touch of his hempen clutch, like a
corpse’s icy hold, . ~ ,
And the dolorous knell of this dreary cell, and
your parson’s snuffling hum;
And your creed I hate with a hate that shall last
when Time itself is done.
« And I will not go to that land of woe of which
the Christians tell,
Adown the slope of a slimy rope on the road to
the white man’s Hell:
In the evil place of my father’s race there is room
enough for me,
And the dark Hindoo will not burn with you in a
borrowed eternity.”
The prisoner sat in his murky cell and glared at
the prison stew,
And regarded the pie with a gloomy eye and ate
not the gaol ragout;
And the hash that was bought with the Govern-
ment cash was boiled and thrown away,
For he guessed he would grub with Beelzebub if
he stayed to be hanged to-day.
TITUS SALT.
“THE BULLETIN.”
(Published at SYDNEY, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
“The Bulletl
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dit
tinctive Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
Payment of Members,
One Person, one Vote.
State Revenue derived directly from the Land
Complete Secularisation of State Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prisoi
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
The Bulletin denounces —
Religious Interference in Politics,
Foreign Titles.
The Chinese.
Imperial Federation.
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started eleven years ago with no capital but brains>
and has become a vast property, because it pos.
sesses a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress: it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who-claim
to monopolise salvation, aerainst the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, THE
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin i*
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by it«
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torre
Straits, and the digger in the New Zealanfl
Ranges. A paper which is at once the mos
popular city publication and the organ of tn
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly baser
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin 8
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact"'
easily ascertainable from any postal official— mat,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The ovur
letin is the one most frequently remaned trow
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of aH Aus
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng'
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original an
specially-written reading matter is the bright 0
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and nm
artistic, and its policy the boldest and m
straightforward ever submitted to the Austral
public.

Noble-street, Newton, Geelong,
10th December, 1888.
To H. P. KroRi.MANN, Esq.
Dear Sir, This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. I consulted
more than one doctor, and during that time took a great
quantity of medicine without it doing me the slightest
good, but 1 became worse every day, wasting awaji until
1 became a perfect skeleton. About February last I began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of had matter I
was expectorating every day, t became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. I agreed
and went under your treatment in'March last. At the
end of three months I was taken bad one morning, and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time 1 commenced to improve, ami
was gaining in weight every day. About a mouth ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, I am as well as ever.
I’. KEENAN.
