This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN
DISEASES.
fte has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may bo eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to hi j
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.
YOUNG MEN
who suffer from the results of early follies, trans-
gressions or excesses of more nature age, bladder
difficulties, a whitish or dark ropy sediment in
the water, accompanied by slight burning or
smarting sensation, Headaches, Drowsiness during
the day, circles round the eyes. Giddiness,
irregularity of the bowels, specks before the eyes,
bashfulness, discontentedness, weakness or pains
in the back. Liver or kidney complaints, dreams,
buzzing noises in the ears and head, pimples, a
fear that something dreadful is about to happen,
weak stomach, yellow or blood-shot eyes, impure
blood, hasty, uncontrollable temper, hacking
cough, who cannot marry, nervousness in society,
wakefulness, palpitation of the heart, general
weakness, and other symptoms which lead to in-
sanity and death, should consult him, for he has
mastered these difficulties. On receipt of Gd, in
stamps he will send secure from observation in a
plain wrapper, postage

Showing plainly how all diseases of the private or
nervous system may be cured thoroughly and per-
manently without unnecessary expence. This
book will prove a valuable companion, and e ven
though you be perfectly well its general inform-
tion and prescription may assist you in restoring
some poor friend to health even after his case has
been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tendant,
ONE POUND IS SUFFICIENT TO
SEND
for Remedies necessary for the cure of NER-
VOUS DEBILITY. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
gerous, it would be advisable for you to sit down
quietly in your chamber and write to the doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. He wiil
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a' candid and straightforward
oponion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, scud for his famous medical
w'ork, the price of which is but sixpence ; enclosed
in the volume will be found a Ist of carefully-pro-
pared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
Dr. Richards uses nothing but the purest remedies,
and never prescribes mercury under any circum-
stances. The moment letters are carefully per-
used and answered they arc destroyed by tiro,
and patients may rest assured that their cases
will remain a secret between the doctor ami
themselves. Dr. Richards has successfully treated
nearly 25,000 cases since coming to Australia, and
has permission from at least 10,000 persons to
show their written evidence of his success. All

Specialist for the t'eatnwnt of this class of disc so.; >.. t,
unfortunately for the suffering publiciu Anst'aiia the
apathy shown by Qualified Mon in the treatment of
Mirniile and Xervotii Complaints has induced men of the
lowest grade of intellect (whose only qualifications are
unlimited assurance) to spring up, and by specious
advertisements and false promises trap tile unwary.
It is very evident that sufferers from these diseases
have been scandalously treated by these unqualified
persons The evidence taken at .the Medical Enquiry
held in Sydney (published in the Dally Til umph. Nov.
iith ‘th and Bth, IS’JOj plainly shows the disgraceful
manner in wh ! ch patients are duped. Not only are
they robbed of their money, but what is of iofl.itiuy
greater importance, their health is injured also. It is
therefore time that I.really Qualified Men entered the
field to fight these pests ‘of society with their own
Weapons, viz., Advertising.
It is utterly impossible for those who are suffering
fro-n the.e diseases, who are scattered over ill parts of
Australasia,, to ascertain which Qualified IVaeliiionee
makes those diseases his speciality unless he advertises
I consider therefore, that by advertising / „„ t „

Constitutional Treason.
The draft Australian Constitution now being
considered in Convention has at least one
merit —almost unique as a feature of any
document formulated by lawyers only—it is
terse, perspicuous, and a model of simplicity
of expression. Those pernicious involutions
of phrase with which it is one of the tricks
of the lawyer's trade to enwrap alike both
fact and fiction, are distinguishable by their
absence from almost every chapter and sub-
section. In whatever form the Constitution
may be adopted, and whatever may be its
result in legislation or upon the interests of
the people, the men who framed its scaffold-
ing will have demonstrated that it is possible
to clothe legal enactments in terms capable of
“being understanded of the common people. ”
Chief-Justice Higinbotham, in pursuing his
work of consolidating the Victorian Statutes,
kept constantly in view simplification of
phrase and exactitude of definition. He
brushed aside the fetich of tautology before
which the medicine-men and the swindling
augurs of the Law have been accus-
tomed to compel the people to bow down,
and we are glad to perceive that the influence
which the great democrat—great lawyer, but
greater man—still exercises over the thought
of his generation, exiled though he is to the
judicial bench, has extended to the Conven-
tion. The very non-ambiguity and precision
of wording makes, however, the dangerous
effect of the draft Constitution more palpable
and patent. Had the document been as
complex, as involved, and as absurd in point
of phrasing as the majority of the Acts
which, a heritage from the dark ages of
Britain, burden the Australias with an im-
ponderable mass of obscurity, there would
have been no inconsiderable chance of some
fatal clause passing unnoticed at the present
day and leaving a legacy of doubt and
disaster to a later time. We wish we could
as highly praise the Bill as a statesmanlike
attempt to grapple with the novel conditions
under which an enduring Federation of the
Australian “ Colonies ” alone can be effected.
As a coherent expression of an advanced
national policy, the draft falls immeasurably
short of its opportunity, and presents just
those interstices in the materials of its
structure which enable the representatives
of the Classes to import the tools with which
they mean the destruction of the democracy.
The Class-men have lost no time in utilising
the gaps.

Necessarily, before these words appear in
print, the draft Constitution will be altered
in several particulars. But it may safely be
prophesied fcjqp provisions of the
draft* ;mTai n'S’i'ill e d tl l eywnUi >c' amendecT'in
a direction the reverse of that where stands
the Australian ideal. The resolutions pro-
posed by Sir Henry Parkes did not face,
and the draft does not move a foot, so to
speak, towards the Federated Republic
which is the ultimate goal of the Australias.
The propulsive force was, however, expected
to be manifested in Convention when the
Constitutional Committee reported. But
the amendments effected up to date have
driven the scheme farther away from the
goal of true and intelligent Australian poli-
tical thought. The trend of the Conven-
tion’s stops is Imperialistic, not Australian :
the men themselves arc betraying both their
own past and tire Australian future. There
is scarcely a man among the Convention—
we speak by the book and can, if need be,
give chapter and verse—but has, at some
time or other, declared publicly his convic-
tion that the ultimate destiny of these
countries is separation from the Mother-land.
He has done so from no extraordinary
power of prescience, but simply because the
most inert politician has been acted upon by
the subtle acid of the time, which is biting
away at one and the same moment both the
Throne and “the bonds which link” the
dependencies and the Throne. If these men
are sincere in their belief that the evolu-
tionary forces at work in our political society
must sooner or later disintegrate the “ Em-
pire,” then where is their claim to
statesmanship, where, indeed, their claim
to be regarded as commonly honest, if they
do not with such wisdom and such power as
political experience and knowledge of life
confer upon them, smooth the path to the
goal of Australian aspirations ? If they are
honest men they are untrue to their past
and to the representative position which
they now hold and which they presumably
gained because of their past. And if they
claim to be guided by the comprehensive-
ness of view and perception of principles
which form the statesman, then how can
they explain their relation to the irresist-
ible power which, overruling the mere
mechanism of politics and politicians, is
quietly and naturally forcing upon the people
of the Australias a policy of national inde-
pendence ? They can only prove their
honesty at the expense of their intelligence.
Independence will come, is coming, in spite
of the Convention and the politicians. Hie
politicians can block the way, if they choose.
They may in doing so cause disaster for a
time. But they will no more succeed in
preventing access to the terminus than the
wretch who chocks a log on the railway-
lines stops the nation’s rail traffic.
# # *
That the majority of the Convention are
doing their best to upset the Australian
coach as it travels on the route of Nationalism,
in the childish hope that it will then be
turned round and start anew for Imperialism,
is now apparent. The divisions on the
motions to make the Governor-General an
elective official, and on the proposal to base
the federal franchise on the principle that
one man shall have one vote and no more,
are incontestable signs of this shameful
desire. An elective Governor-General is a
preliminary to the final freedom of these
provinces, or, pursuing the figure we have
already used, a mile-stone on the road to the
Australian goal. At the present moment
this mile-stone, this stage, could, if the
Convention so willed it, be reached by the
people of the Australias without perceptible
effort, without any rude straining of the
“ Imperial bonds,” and without any particu-
lar violation to the Imperialistic instincts.
The elective Governor-General would not
necessarily be an Australian ; he might, in-
deed, be a peer of England ; even one of
those exemplary and intelligent personages,
the Princes of the Blood Royal might
be chosen. Surely an election of a
man from the “ Empire ” at large,
rather than from the Federated States
only, would have a much more potent influ-
ence on the relations of the “ Empire ” and
the “Colonies ” than his mere nomination—
which might be the price of a party treachery
or of a woman’s honour—by the British
Ministry “or the man Rogers ?” To such a
suffrage a Gladstone, not to say a Dufferin
or a Dilke, might appeal without lowering
his personal prestige. All the world over,
an honour conferred by the popular will is a
thousand times more precious than one
awarded for reasons which cannot, in
decency, be divulged. Viewed from the
Imperialistic standpoint, an elective Gover-
nor-General might, it is conceivable, be the
more desirable institution. Viewed even from
the Australian standpoint, there is no ques-
tion as to his being an essential institution.
What, then, we have again to ask the mem-
bers of the Convention, or, rather, that huge
majority which out-voted Sir George Grey,
Dr. Cockburn, and Mr. Kingston, have
they to say for the decision which, so
far from bringing the Australias a stage
nearer the peaceable consummation of
every true Australian’s hopes, goes the other
way 1 The special, correspondent of the
Melbourne Argus, who is known to be hand
and glove with the leading Conventionists,
cannot be suspected of a partiality to demo-
cratic views, yet he declares that the number
of Convention members who thought with
Sir George Grey, but voted against him,
was larger “than many would believe.”
The Bulletin, from its personal knowledge
of many of the delegates, affirms the same
thing. When some Bancroft arises, fifty
years hence, to tell the story of the founding
of our Constitution, what will he say about
'those palsied guides and purblind leaders of
the people who resolutely turned their backs
on the path indicated by the finger-posts of
patriotism, statesmanship, and honour, and
wended their way in the contrary direction 0
By their devotion to Imperial interests,
by their lack of courage to act up to their
convictions, the men in Convention have
unquestionably made it plain that they
entered into a series of compromises. The
negotiations have not been published but,
nevertheless, they have taken place—the
parties to immoral traffic seldom proclaim their
transactions. There are compromises, and
there are compromises. There is a c mpro-
miso of mere expediency which is (he balance
of details and particulars, and there is the
compromise of principle, which is.simply an
attempt, foredoomed to failure, to balance
right and wrong, or good and evil. There
can be no compromise in morals ; the bases
of ethics arc unshifting, and stand ‘‘four-
square” and immoveable to every “ wind of
doctrine.” From the law that for every
deviation from the straight line there shall
be incurred a penalty, nations and societies
are not exempt any more than individuals ;
neither States nor individuals can palter
with . ethical truth without suffering. It is
plain, we say, that there have been compro-
mises upon compromises among the Con-
vention members, and we would be the first
to applaud them were the points involved
merely those.connected with administrative
procedure, and not problems co-relaled to
the functions of morals. Upon such a point,
for instance, as the selection of a site for a
Federal Capital, compromise may be not
only desirable but necessary, and therefore
wise ; sq, too, with regard to the proportion
of senatorial representation or of tariff-
adjustment. But when it comes to a ques-
tion of freedom, to one concerning the right
of self-government, to one of the mainten-
ance of simple honesty in public affairs, the
matter is altogether different. Upon a
question of the kind compromise is impos*
sible, for wrong can never be right, any
more than white can be black. You cannot
have half-tones in morals.
# # #
Has, however, the question as to whether
the Governor-Generalship shall be an elec-
tive post or not, a moral aspect ? Is it not
an abuse of terms to describe it as
originating in or having a relation to
morals 1 These are interrogatories which
the Imperialists have put, and they them-
selves shall provide the answer. The
Governor-Generalship must be either a
principle or detail —something that is
either indispensable to the Federal struc-
ture, or something for which something else
may be substituted Avithout perceptible
loss. Now, the Imperialists declare—we
quote from the Argus, than which no
journal is more effusively “loyal' 1 to
the Imperial connection--that to refuse
the Crown the power to nominate
the Governor-General, Avould mean “the
hauling-doAvn of the national flag,” and
that his election by the Australian people
would virtually “ cut the painter.” A pro-
ceeding which might bring about these
dreadful contingencies cannot belong to the
category of mere details ; it is vital ; it is
essential; in short, it is a principle. Treat it
as of a secondary importance only, and you
Avould, on the Imperialists’ oavii showing, err
grievously. Force the Imperialists into the
corner, and they agree with Sir George
Grey and the Radicals Avho are proud to
follow in his footsteps, that the method by
Avhich the Governor-General is to be ap-
pointed is peculiarly a question of principle.
Between questions of principle and questions
of pure ethics, there is never any dividing
line. They dovetail imperceptibly.
* # *
This question of the Governor-Generalship
derives its importance, and the conduct of
the men who voted against making the post
elective, its treasonable character, from the
consideration that a nominated Governor-
General must be a sham and a falsity.
Parkes, moved by that poetaster's senti-
mentalism of his which sometimes mocks
him by leading him to the very verge of a
luminous truth, but oftener drives him to
the depths of mawkish inanity, clenched his
main argument at the Melbourne Conference
for a “Federation under the Crown” by
remarking that “the Governor-General of
Australia would be able to hold a Court that
Avould be as attractive as that of the monarch
of the old Avorld, which is not a light thing
to be passed over as a matter of sentiment.”
Right at the root of the Nominee Viceroy-
ship lies this simulacrum of a “ Court ” rvith
all its parasitisms and all its falsehoods. A
man in Avhose hands the people place the
charter of its executive power’ — a Lincoln,
a Garfield, a Grant —Avould, almost cer-
tainly, be a man who Avould estimate
“society” at its true worthlessness. Between
his rugged, perhaps toil-hardened palms,
“society” would be chary of placing its
Avhite gloves, afraid that the immaculateness
of the kid might be stained by a drop of
honest sweat; but a Viceroy Avho had “kissed
hands ” on receiving Her Majesty’s commis-
sion, Avho, perhaps, had been permitted to
dig the Heir-Apparent in the ribs, to back
his Royal Highness’ bills, and to cash his
Royal Highness’ 1.0.U.’s at the baccarat-
tables to a Governor-General of this
class a “ Court ” would be necessary, and
courtiers many. It is to our shame that
they would be many. The vice-regal
system Avhich has obtained in Australia to
the present day has been socially degrading.
It could not have helped being anything
else. It has produced a breed of syco-
phants ; it has set up false standards of
living; it has made, or has sought to
make, a card of entree to Government
House a certificate of manly and womanly
virtue. But the vice-regal system which the
Constitution will create, inasmuch as it will
be more distinctly aristocratic, will intensify
the resultant evils and the resultant shame.
“So long,” said Sir George Grey in Con-
vention, “as there are Governors-General
sent here from England, so long, I believe,
there must be inevitably an aristocratic
British Party resident in Australia.” The
venerable Pro-Consul declared the true Aus-
tralian mind in these words. A nominee
Governor-General will be surrounded with
an aristocracy which will look to Britain for
sanction of its social developments, and will
esteem political distinction only as it is
branded with a titular “ honor.” It will be,
however, a class that will bo deficient in the
one feature which can ever be admirable in
an aristocracy, for that high-breeding of the
individual which is the product of the
leisure and culture of generations will be
wanting here. Our “ Colonial ” aristocracy
will not be the less but the more pernicious
because it does not bear the hall-mark of
“ long descent ” and inherited instincts. It
will be a privileged caste without the one
quality which can redeem the privilege.
# # *
Now, in the Australian Commonwealth
there must be no room for caste or a privi-
leged class. The p ditics of the twentieth
century will be sociological ; it will be the
happiness of society in the mass and in the
unit, and not the aggrandisement of dynastic
or plutocratic sections, that will be the con-
cern of the State. The hour will soon strike
when the cry of an infant at its starving
mother’s milkless breast will stir the heart
of the nat'on quicker than a thousand Im-
perial rescripts. In the sphere of the new
politics the born aristocrat shall have his
share of justice, and his opportunity ; the
brat born in the gutter shall have no less.
This is plainly written on the walls of the
present social structure, and the men who
shut their eyes to the inscription invite the
fate of Belshazzar. Deep sunk into the in-
telligence of the masses everywhere is the
truth of Bakounine’s remark “ that it is
the characteristic of privilege to kill the
mind and the heart of men.” The privileged
man, whether politically or ecoiromically, is
a man depraved in mind and heart. This is
a social law which admits of no exception,
and is applicable to entire nations as to
classes, corporations and individuals. It is
the law of equality, the supreme condition
of liberty and humanity. And because
a vice-regality will sustain an existing
privileged class and create new ones
the Australians must have none of it.
“ The Governor-General will only be a
ceremony,” said Parkes in Melbourne ;
“ the position will only be a bauble, a gilded
toy,” said Deakin in Sydney. How can the
viceroy be a mere ceremony or an idle
bauble, if he hold the power to veto the
will of the united Australias ? But suppose
Parkes and Deakin are correct, we ask—
What do the Australias want with mere
ceremonies, empty baubles, or childish toys?
Are our men children, or are they the
founders of a nation which is to precede the
world to the tablelands of regenerated
humanity? If the former, then why stop
at one Sham ? Why not bring along a
gaudier ceremony and an emptier bauble
still ? Give us a peculiar share in the
Crown. Make us a kingdom, and “Victoria,
by the grace of Goi>, Queen of Great Britain
and Ireland, and Empress of India,” also
“ Queen of Australia !” The Conventionists
have only to act on this hint to assure them-
selves the peerages which are at present in
the clouds,
* #
The treason to the Australian future,
which the Convention effected by its decision
on the proposal to make the Governor-
General elective, does not stand alone. It is
emphasised by the vote on Dr. Cock burn’s
attempt to make the franchise of the Federal
Parliament essentially democratic. So con-
temptible a shuffling with the plain issue is
rarely witnessed in any deliberative assembly.
Creating a Federal Parliament, the Conven-
tion are calling to existence a distinct body of
electors, whose franchise must, therefore, be
defined at the outset. This duty is no
function of the State. If it be, then nine-
tenths of the talk in Convention as to State-
right was useless and mischievous. The
Convention, by a majority vote of 28 to 9,
referred the Federal franchise to the several
States —in other words, declared that there
should be a Federal Union without uni-
formity or identity of constituency. This
vote in itself was not treason, may not have
been even insincere, may simply have been
a misjudgment of the position. But when it
was effected under the influence of motives
which the majority had not intelligence
enough to disguise, and which was nothing
less than the desire to prevent the operation
of absolute unqualified manhood suffrage
throughout the Federation, it can only be
properly designated as treason to the Com-
monwealth. In every State at the present
time, with the exception of South Australia
and New Zealand, the property-vote is
the master of the political situation,
even in the popular chambers. Its influ-
ence in Victoria is partially modified
by the circumstances that the elections are
held on the one day, but elsewhere it
retains its destructive supremacy almost un-
challenged. Impose upon the States a
function which is not theirs, which has
nothing to do with their State independence,
and the proceeding is tantamount to giving
the multiplied property-vote preponderance
with the Federal Parliament. This the


Convention has done knowingly, with a
clear apprehension of the significance of its
act; it has denied Australian manhood, as
manhood, the prime prerogative of citizen-
ship—the right to a voice in the election ot
its rulers. There is but one term to describe
this deed : Treason.
* * *
These provinces are democratic communi-
ties, and for their representatives to juggle
the’democracy out of the opportunity to
exert its full strength on any question vital
to its interests is as traitorous an act as
could be performed. Parkes, amidst the
applause of the majority, declared that
the Convention was not the proper place
to enunciate the true democratic doc-
trine. “At the proper time he would
be prepared to deal with the question.”
Does any sane man believe Parkes, trickster
and opportunist, will ever arrive at the
proper time till the people force him ? How
did he regard the “ one-man-one-vote ” idea
in New South Wales till Mr. Traill was
backed by the popular judgment? “All
they have to do,” he went on, “ was to bring
the Federal Parliament into existence, it
could find the means of giving shape to its
own electoral system,” At the base of the
Federal Parliament must be the elector.
Who will trust the Federal Parliament,
fettered by the States and the Constitution
and elected by the faggot vote, to declare
the right of* manhood to electoral power,
when the Federal Convention, unfettered
unexcept by self-imposed bonds, repudiates
so vital a principle ? “It was almost pre-
sumptuous,” he concluded, “for the Con-
vention to declare what that electoral system
should be.” If the Convention may not lay
the foundation, its effort to build the super-
structure is an unjustifiable aggression. But
no one, not even the men who applauded
him, believes Parkes meant these things.
All know he was only posing ; Jennings,
with his woolly intelligence, and Fitzgerald
with the soul which is an emanation from his
own vats, know it; the propertied people, of
whom Jennings and Fitzgerald are the
mouth-pieces, know it. They know, too,
that when Parkes was followed by 27 Con-
ventionists into the lobby, the vote was safe
for the time being, and that once again
democracy has been betrayed by its pseudo-
friends.
* * *
The duty of the Australian electors is now
plain. They must insist (1) upon the Con-
stitution, as finally passed by the Conven-
tion, being submitted to them for ratification,
amendment, or rejection ; and (2) that a
second Convention shall be held to consider
State amendments. Sir George Grey has
tabled in Convention a motion for the sub-
mission of the Constitution to a plebiscite of
the people. This motion was no sooner pro-
posed than, as The Bulletin has been
informed, heads were counted, and it was
concluded that it would not be adopted by
the Convention. It would be a surprising
fact if it were, considering how the Conven-
tion has already damned itself and its work.
But not merely the plebiscite must be in-
sisted upon by the people, but a referendum
in detail to the electors. Such a course will
be denounced, of a certainty, as “Un-
English ” ; it will be the wiser and the truer
for that very reason. It is because the Con-
vention has been so English that it has
betrayed Australia.
Universal Ignorance.
A cvilised nation of modern times is described
by Ruskin as a motley gathering of humanity,
which resolves itself practically into three
elements. First of all there is a mass of discon-
tented, penniless, and half-taught, or less than
half-taught, inhabitants, which calls itself the
people; secondly, a thing which calls itself a
Government, meaning an apparatus for col-
lecting and spending money; and thirdly, a
small number of capitalists, many of them
rogues and most of them stupid persons, who
have no idea of any object other than money-
making, gambling, and animal enjoyment. This
description was intended to apply exclusively
to the so-called civilisation which has grown up
in recent centuries, but practically it has been
the history of all nations and all ages. Of the
three classes, at least two have always been
present—the Government in its capacity as a
machine for collecting and spending money and
an instrument for executing anyone who
objected to its existence ; and the people, the
dull, ignorant mass of human bodies and alleged
human souls that submitted with dreary, ox-
like patience to innumerable sufferings and
exactions, because unable in its ignorance
to comprehend the possibility of a state in which
these elements were wanting. As for the
capitalist, he is a variable quantity and
dependant upon circumstances. The first
business of every country is to support a
Government and to have enough left over
to keep the population alive and in working
condition in order that they may continue to
support the Government, and if there be only
sufficient to fill these requirements the capitalist
class is non-existent; if there be anything more
the capitalist is always present i. > take the
balance. Should the balance increase, the
capitalist and the Government scramble for the
surplus ; should it diminish, the fight between
these two parties assumes a more frenzied
aspect than usual because they are both
ravenous and both insatiable ; but the difference,
so far as the people are concerned, is very
slight—in the first case their situation is about
as bad as it can be, and in the second it is a
little worse The one privilege possessed by
this third party in the State is that it never
becomes extinct—a privilege which it shares
with the horse and the cow and other indis-
pensable animals; for the Government have
something to govern, and the Government and
the capitalist must both have something to live
upon, so they combine to keep the nation alive
for purposes of revenue. And the one class
which endures everything and pays for every-
thing, accepts the situation with tolerable con-
tentment, because in its fathomless ignorance it
is unable to realise the possibility of anything
very much better.
* # *
The world has lived on its ignorance for many
centuries. It has done what it was told to do,
and has thought what it was told to think with
persistent regularity, and it is about as ignorant
in the present age of enlightenment as it was in
the days before it was enlightened. It has
made immense advances in education within
recent years, and its verb agrees with its nomi-
native more than it used to do ; it knows more
ancient kings and ancient battles, and has
acquired a better idea as to the exact situation
of many inaccessible mountains with unpro-
nounceable names, and bottomless swamps with
names that are long and incomprehensible, and
ungetatable rivers in regions which cannot be
reached, and yet its ignorance goes on with
very little deviation. It has acquired sundry
dead languages and much equally dead arith-
metic, but all this knowledge has had very
little effect upon the condition of the great
mass which is commonly dominated the People.
Even the spread of democratic institutions has
only altered the outward semblance of things,
and the bulk of humanity still goes out enthu-
siastically to be shot in quarrels from which it
gains no benefit, and gives way to bursts of
frenzy over political changes which lighten none
of its burdens, and pays the bill as joyously as
of old when it hears that it is necessary to whale
some alien race—in fact, it does what it is told
to do almost as slavishly as it did in the days
of absolutism. Even among the most intelli-
gent of nations nine-tenths of the population
are without any intelligence, except such as has
been gained at second-hand; they take their
inspiration from the politician with the loudest
voice and the longest hair, and it lasts till some
still louder individual supplies a fresh set of
opinions in its stead.
* * *
The progress of the Irish question in England
is a conspicuous example. Ten years ago
Liberals and Conservatives were practically
unanimous on the subject of coercion. Glad-
stone gave his vote for coercion in those days,
and his party voted as he told it to vote, and
all Great Britain did the same. In all England
and Scotland there was hardly a solitary con-
stituency which did not regard Parnell and
his party as a gathering of depraved insurrec-
tionists, and there were but few English or
Scotch members in the Commons who did not
take the same view. Then came Gladstone’s
great recantation, and straightway half Eng-
land went bald-headed for Home Rule, and at
least one-third of the House of Commons fol-
lowed suit. They had all howled for Union
because they had been commanded to howl for
Union, and, in like manner, they howled for
Home Rule when their political bosses in-
structed them to do so ; and yet had the fiat
gone forth from the Conservative instead of the
Liberal camp, the Tory party would have
whooped for Parnell with almost equal fluency.
And, in like manner, when Dalley conceived
the idea of sending a contingent to Africa, he
did not appeal to any existing opinion or offer
to supply any existing public want. The
country had never felt that it was necessary for
its health and comfort to go forth and kill an
Arab, and spend a vast sum of money in the
process—if there had been any such want it
would probably have been aware of the fact;
but the glib politician merely issued the state-
ment that New South Wales was pining to
spend the money and to kill the Arab, and the
great mass of the local population, having no
opinions of its own and no knowledge except
such as it received at second hand, at once
accepted the announcement and acted accord-
ingly. A million human beings were assured
by one fluent orator that they were boiling over
with loyalty, and though they had no previous
conception of the fact, they straightway boiled
over out of the depths of their own fathomless
ignorance—in fact, they acted as they were
told to act, and the slaves of an Asiatic despot
could have done no more; indeed, it is ques-
tionable if they would have done so much.
In an intelligent and democratic community
somewhere about one-tenth of the population
possibly attempts to think on its own account
without much success ; in a community which
is neither intelligent nor democratic one man
generally does the thinking for the entire nation,
and does it badly, and if he finds any un-
authorised individual taking a hand in the work
he executes him as being a person of dangerous
and revolutionary tendencies. The whole
course of politics in all countries is based on the
assumption that humanity always exercises its
alleged intelligence by proxy. When Parkes
stumps New South Wales on the Freetrade
ticket he does it on the plain, unvarnished
theory that the colony has no brains or opinions
or resolutions of its own, and that for want of
these attributes it will vote at his instructions ;
and when Dibbs stumps the same country on
the Protectionist ticket he acts on precisely the
same axiom. If the populace vote for Parkes
in preference to his opponent it merely demon-
strates that Parkes’ voice or his eloquence or
his size or his hair or some other attribute has
created the greater impression, but it certainly
does not demonstrate that the nation has any
fixed views in favour of Freetrade, for if they
possessed any such views then the necessity for
Parkes to go on the stump would vanish. The
openly expressed conviction that Freetrade will
end with Parkes is an open acknowledgment
that when Parkes is gone the party will not be
able to raise another orator with the same
capacity for beguiling the country into voting
against its Protectionist convictions—if it has
any —or else it is the expression of a fear that
the Protectionist party will then have the
advantage in the matter of fluency and gush,
and will thus induce the populace to vote
against its Freetrade opinions—supposing it to
possess any such substance. In like manner it
is freely asserted in England that the cause of
Home Rule depends on the survival of Glad-
stone for a few years longer, which is a candid
admission that the English elector has an un-
biased opinion laid on in his house in the same
manner as gas, and when Gladstone dies his
successor may lay on an altogether different
opinion, and thereby change the entire course of
British politics. That the elector should have
any definite opinion of his own, except on the
most elementary subjects, never enters into the
calculation, and the visionary, who starts on
the assumption that the world knows anything
except what it is told to know, is certain,
sooner or later, to be “ left.” And even Glad-
stone, the Tribune of the English people, is
travelling on a second-hand conviction lent him
by Parnell, and if Parnell had not existed
there would probably have been no Home Rule
party in England at all.

Public opinion is in the main the force of
aggregate ignorance, guided partly by heredity,
partly by concussion, and partly by infection.
The European is nominally a Christian because
he was told to call himself one by another
European of the previous generation and the
name has become a matter of habit; and Pro-
testantism, Catholicism, and other branches of
the faith have all their separate strongholds
merely because the Protestant has no fixed
reason for being a Protest, and the Catholic is
a Catholic without any visible cause, except
that their respective ancestors so directed them.
The rampant Abigail howls for Orangeism
owing to the passing chance which caused him
to be born in a certain place and under certain
circumstances, but there is no inherent force in
Abigail which would have made him what he
is apart from these circumstances; under
another set of conditions he would have been
as intolerant in the cause of Confucius as he is
now in the cause of Dutch William. Here and
there, at long distances and at longer intervals,
the world produces by chance an original
thinker who saves the human race from becom-
ing stereotyped and utterly stagnant, but their
number is lamentably few. Mankind, in
general, consists of a governing class which
governs according to certain old traditions
because it is incapable, in its ignorance, of in-
venting new ones, and a subordinate multitude
which submits by force of habit, because, despite
its increasing education, it is too ignorant to
know how to resist, too dull to possess any
coherent opinions except those which are sup-
plied to it in a ready-made condition, and too
stagnant to know anything beyond a craving
for some reform which it cannot define. It
creates a revolution, now and then, and is un-
able to decide what to do with it when it is
made, and it overturns a despot here and there,
and from sheer force of habit permits another
despot to grow up in his place, and it is plun-
dered and exploited by rings and syndicates,
capitalists, monarchs, politicians, and priests
because it has been plundered through all the
ages, and the descendants of the horse-leech
have become so completely a part of its existence
that it lacks even the knowledge and the
originality to dispense with them.
The Australian community is probably one of
the most enlightened and progressive at present
existing upon earth, and a liberal system of
education has given to the inhabitants of this
continent many advantages which are unknown
in most other lauds. Consequently, the Aus-
tralian citizen has aquired a large and general
knowledge of football and acquatics, and his
information on the subject of horses and bruising
is eminently reliable. As for his political
economy, it is mostly acquired at second-hand
from Parkes and other equally uncertain
sources, and his religious convictions are partly
derived from the imported bishop or priest,
who has little to dispose of, and partly from
the imported Orange lodge, which has none at
all. He has certain vague misgivings about
Socialism, because, in the first place, he has no
distinct idea what it is, and because, in the
second, he has been informed by Bur-
dekin or the Argus, or some similar
authority, that it is a nefarious project and
eminently unworkable. Also, he has sundry
aspirations regarding the abolition of land-
monopoly, if he only knew how to begin, and
if he is a draper he is loyal on account of his
miserable salary, his shiny boots and his collar,
whereas if he is an artisan he is Republican for
various other reasons. He is a self-governing
individual, and he governs the country pretty
much as he is told, and those from whom he
takes his instructions know less of the subject
than he does himself, and yet even they are
vastly superior in knowledge and intelligence
to the great majority of humanity. The strong
point of this world is its wide and general
ignorance, and what it does know it mostly
acquired by word of mouth from some exceed-
ingly uncertain authority, and he usually
diffuses the information because it was handed
down to him from his ancestors, and how they
gained it, or whether they ever gained it at all,
no one can tell.
“Freedom of Contract.”
B. R. Wise, with his thrust at the “fetish of
freedom of contract,” has thrown a firebrand
among thorns, and the air is filled with the
crackling thereof. With alternate vacuous
guffaw and windy vituperation the capitalistic
press has thrown itself afresh into the battle for
the inalienable right of the employer to make
what terms he pleases with his men ; and all
the resources of journalistic objurgation have
been strained in the effort to cope adequately
with the iniquity of the Queensland shearers’
supposed attack on the sacred principle of
fr-'c lom of contract. As a matter of fact there
is no such attack. Freedom of contract is no
more at stake in the strike of the Queensland
shearers than is the law of gravitation or the
dogma of papal infallibility. Moreover, the
question could not be at stake there, because no
such thing as freedom of contract is at this
moment open to the Queensland shearers. The
attitude of the hysterical section of the daily
press on this subject may be the outcome of its
habitual mendacity, or it may be merely
chuckleheadedness ; probably it lias some con-
nection with both.
* * #
Obviously there can be no freedom of con-
act except when the contracting parties
are equally free—equally dependent on one
another, or mutually independent. In Queens-
land the organised importation of black-
leg labour has destroyed that essential condi-
tion. It has placed in the hands of the squatter
a weapon to coerce the shearers into compliance
with his terms, and has made real freedom of
contract an impossibility. Lot there be no mis-
take about that. Trade Unionism, which has
brought labour on to something like equal con-
tracting terms with capitalist monopoly, bids
fair to find its match and more in the systematic
organisation by capital of the power of the
blackleg. If it is to regain its ground it must
look for some means of eliminating the black-
leg, and this it can only do by destroying the
system of which he is a product.
# * *
The blackleg, in essence, is the superfluous
man, the man on the outer margin with the
black sea of starvation on one side, and a star-
vation wage on the other. Since first the wage-
system was coupled with monopoly—one class
seizing the patrimony of the race, and imposing
on the other class a heritage of paid service—
the blackleg and his prototypes have been the
toiler’s scourge, “The poor always ye have
with you,” has bitter truth for the man who has
earned his bread for a master in the sweat of
his brow. Wherever and whenever the man
on the margin has been willing to take, or has
been forced to take, a starvation wage, he has
set in motion the blind, merciless engine of Un-
restricted Competition which inevitably crushed
every wage-earner down to his own level. That
was the evil that trade-unionism, with its
weapon the strike, was designed to resist. For
a time it succeeded. It clogged the wheels of
competition, and though the man on the margin
was still there, he ceased to be effective as an
instrument of oppression in the hands of mono-
poly. Freedom of contract in some measure
became possible. True, it was still in the
power of the employer, as before, to say:
“Take work on my terms or starve;” but the
labourer, entrenched behind his union, had now
the reply: “ Employ me or your land will not
be tilled, your sheep will go unshorn, your
loom will be idle, and you must face ruin.”
Ruin on one side, starvation on the other,
brought the parties to a fair footing.
* * #
But the balance has been again disturbed.
A conspiracy of monopolists has brought the
blackleg once more to the front, made
him once more a factor to be reckoned
a menace to his class. The man who
will take, or must take, a starvation wage
has found his old place, and recommenced his
historic function, except that instead of his
being pitted, as of yore, man to man in the
cruel race of competition, it is now array
against army. Competition is the weapon of
monopoly against labour ; Unionism, in so far
as it was a check on competition, was labour’s
sole defence ; and if monopoly can once more set
competition free, it must inevitably get labour
again under its heel. When that happens,
freedom of contract will make a long farewell,
only to come back, if ever, on the bloodstained
wings of revolution. That is what Unionism
in Queensland is struggling against. That is
the future foreshadowed to Queensland labour
by the army of blacklegs, organised, drilled,
handled by capitalist monopoly. Nor is it the
battle of Queensland alone. Let Unionism be
crushed there, and the same tactics will have
force to crush it in New South Wales, and in
every part of the continent,
# * *
It would not be unnatural if the Queensland
shearer, turning out to meet this new invasion,
with the prospect before him of being thrust
again into the abyss of cut-throat competition
out of which Unionism had done so much to
lift him—it would not be unnatural if his feel-
ings should take the shape of personal resent-
ment against the personified image of the
threatened oppression—the blackleg who had
taken the enemy’s shilling and enlisted in the
campaign of coercion. It would not be wonder-
ful if he were tempted to take up the challenge
which the sycophantic organs of capitalism
whoop out so exultantly on the departure of
every new batch of his supplanters. But the
battle now is not to be won by the direct con-
flict to which his enemies are so anxious to
tempt him. Tire odds are too great. The
employers have learnt the lesson of combina-
tion and organisation, and if the struggle is to
be a peaceful one, the capitalist, with the power
of concentrating a marshalled mob of blacklegs
on any given point, must win. It is the story
of the Franco-Prussian war over again. The
side that could always count on bringing 10,000
men to the spot where an engagement was
to take place with 5000 of the enemy, was
pretty safe in telegraphing to Berlin the news
of its victories the day before they came off.
* # #
If the struggle, wc repeat, is to be a peaceful
one. It is too early yet in Australia to seriously
contemplate anything else. Tire appeal to lire
and sword lies always ready to the hand of the
oppressed as a last desperate resort, but no one
thinks of picturing Australian unionism or any
section of it, as reduced to the pitch of despair
—not even, we hope, those who have conceived
the deplorable project of shipping 5000 shearers
to the Argentine Republic. Let the leaders of
federated labour put their foot down there. It
cannot be borne that one ounce of the bone and
sinew of the country should be driven out in
confessed defeat in the struggle with monopoly.
That, in the long run, would only intensify and
prolong the class war, and postpone the ulti-
mate victory, the victory that lies in store for
the world’s workers when they leave the shifts
with which in the past they have gained some
temporary amelioration of their lot, and boldly
attack the forces of caste and monopoly in their
stronghold. We want our men in Australia,
and if anyone has to go, we can spare the
Argentine republic half-a-dozen shiploads of
bloated capitalists better than half-a-dozen
pairs of the sinewy hands whose toil has helped
to lay the foundation of the future Australian
nation.

The time to come may have in store a day
when the workers of Australia find themselves
really at bay, between the devil and the deep
sea, driven to look across the ocean for a place


of refuge. That day is not yet, and we can
barely conceive that it ever will be ; but if such
a day should dawn on this continent there
would be justification enough, backed by scores
of hoary and sacred precedents for a revolution
whose blaze would make the Reign of Terror
pale its ineffectual fires. We are not likely,
however, to find ourselves in need of the
guillotine here. The Australian voter is armed
—and those who are still voteless by reason of
capitalistic laws will soon bo armed—with a
weapon more deadly to monopoly and privilege
than the firestick or the “ bushnian’s sister.”
Just now his business is to get hold of the
ballot-box and learn what he never yet has
learned, how to use it. How to combine and
ivork out one thing at a time.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Australian Fleet.
Australia’s half-built iron-clad tieet is going
the way of iron-clad fleets in general. The
latest news concerning the Karrakatta is that
she has gone out on three successive trial trips,
and has broken down three times, and so far as
evidence goes the other broken-winded dredges
are in about the same condition. It is the same
old yarn that we have heard so often before.
The noble craft starts from her moorings like a
thing of life, and after trampling down two
yachts and a lighter with her big coarse feet
the steering gear at last begins to work, and
she proceeds on her way over the waters, while
the oysters run ahead to keep out of the dust.
Then the demon of incarnate recklessness in
the stoke-hole piles on the coals, and shoves oil
and grease into the furnaces, till at last the
procession starts to annihilate time and space
at the rate of two yards in six weeks, and a
minute later she blow's up and fires six men into
the blue vault of heaven, and their families
have to be compensated. It takes three months
to do the needful repairs, and when the un-
happy vessel gets to sea once more she breaks
down and floats about helplessly for 40 days,
while grass grows on the deck and a blue mould
accumulates on the admiral; and then a
schooner laden with condemned fish takes her
in tow and drags her into the nearest port.
Then she is patched up some more, and blows
the feet off most of her crew while at gun-
practice, owing to the fact that the guns fire
backwards and explode at the wrong end, and
the rest of the ship’s company die of old age on
the voyage. Still she does get to her destina-
tion at last, if she has anything like good for-
tune, and some day the Australian people will
see a pile of old rust and scrap-iron and howling
incapacity on the far horizon, and will know
that their expensive fleet has arrived. And
after that the trouble will begin in real earnest,
for the Australians have only had their country
to defend up till now, whereas in future they
will have to defend their navy as well, and if
an enemy comes along they will have to
fight like demons to keep the crippled
old thing from being captured. As a rule,
when a man of any intelligence goes out
to fight another man larger tnan himself, he
doesn’t take all hi» paralysed female relations
along with him to hamper his movements, and
when Beach or M'Lean goes to row for a cham-
pionship he seldom puts his consumptive grand-
father in the boat for the sake of his assistance
and encouragement; yet this is exactly what
the Australians are doing. They are going
to pile up several million pounds’ worth of
helpless and incapable property in an exposed
situation, and then sit up and watch it, and so
far as the defensive aspect of the affair is con-
cerned it would probably pay about as well if
the money were put on a raft and anchored out-
side the Heads. A fleet which breaks down so
unanimously in calm water, when it is quite
new, may be a handy thing to put old admirals
in, but as a means of heaving defiance at the
world in general it doesn’t amount to much. It
has been killed at the start by too much British
government inspection. The one unfailing
peculiarity about every vessel built under close
official supervision is that it can’t go half a mile
without sinking, whereas any private company
can get a ship built that will sail the seas for
forty years and hardly meet with one serious
accident all the while.
♦—
The Manufacture of History.
“ The present disturbances,” writes an aggres-
sive Queensland, paper on the subject of the
shearers’strike, “ will be in after years one of
the blackest spots in this colony’s history.”
The Bulletin firmly believes that they will,
and not only will they be one of the blackest,
but in all probability they will be the very
blackest and ugliest spot of the whole lot. The
two things that are wanted in the manufacture
of history are one man to write it and another
man to believe it, and the sort of history that
is written is exactly the sort that people are
willing to pay for. The history of the shearers’
“insurrection” will not be written by one of
the strikers, for shearers, as a rule, are not
historians ; nor will it be written for the
strikers, for the average shearer does not buy
histories. But some day it will be printed —if
the class now on top is to have its way—in a
volume marked “for the use of schools,” and
some howling Tory squatter, with his soul full
of bile and aggravation, will supervise the work
in his capac.ty as Minister of Education, and
will see that the gall and the curses and the
adjectives are all correct; and when he has
relieved his feelings with all the language at
his command, his alleged information will be
soaked into the minds of the rising generation,
and will become history. The world is full of
that kind of history, and it is all marked by one
reliable and never-changing feature—that the
party of the man that wrote it was the
bravest and noblest and most beautiful and un-
speakably moral party on earth, and that every
other party was a gang of hideous and diseased
ruffians of the meanest type. The ancient
Greeks started upon this system, and so long as
they wrote all the records that were going,
their invariable peculiarity was that one Greek
—and not a very large Greek either—was able
to scatter an army single-handed, and that the
Greek nation in general knew everything, and
did everything, and conquered every place, and
defeated and killed everybody on the whole
earth. The world has accepted this race for
2000 years at its own valuation ; and yet the
whole Greek people doubled up like a web rag-
in the pages of history the instant another
nation began to do the writing, and their
courage and glory and patriotism were all sold
for old junk on the instant. Their successors,
the Romans, lasted until other nations began to
write about them, and then the dignity and
grandeur, which had weathered so many storms
so long as the empire fixed up its own history,
all went to pot. The Turkish State is coming
to grief to-day for want of more vigorous and
vociferous writing. It is stronger, more
tolerant, more civilised, more progressive, and
a lot cleaner than several of the Christian
kingdoms of Europe, but the Turk is not a
literary character, and his history has been
written for him by hard-lying individuals who
want his territory, until he has become an out-
cast, and it is the duty of all the world to jump
on him. History, in its own erratic and
unaccountable way, made a monster of Lucrezia
Borgia, and though all the evidence goes
to show that she was one of the most
spotless women of her age, it rose superior
to evidence. It made a brilliant genius
out of Elizabeth of England, whose kingdom
was defended by public subscription, because
that meanest and most stupid of crowned
harridans would not even pay the wages of her
own sailors when an enemy was off her coasts,
and it has advertised the same miserable female
as the apostle of religious freedom, regardless of
the conspicuous fact that she was, with one
exception, the most brutal persecutor who ever
reigned in England. And considering these
and a thousand similar episodes, The Bulletin
will be surprised if the shearers’ 44 insurrection”
is not one of the blackest spots in the annals of
Queensland, for it has a good general knowledge
as to the sort of individual who will write these
annals, and history depends, not on the circum-
stances, but the man who dishes-up the circum-
stances and lies about them. And when that
story comes to be written, if it be the interest of
a large and influential governing class—which is
able to hire and pay for the necessary literary
talent — to prove that Parkes was not a man
but a horse, then Parkes will be a horse
accordingly, for the thing that history can’t
prove is not yet created.

The bull-headed J. B. Patterson, of Victoria,
curses his old worn-out curse at trades-
unionism: 44 1 say that because a baker may
have some dispute in Loudon, therefore a
butcher in Edinburgh should join him to carry
out what he is engaged in—l say that is the
invention of the devil.” And on the other
hand, Patterson, supposing a monarch
should have some dispute in London, and
should haul the country into war over some
racket of her own, and a butcher in Edinburgh
should refuse to pay his share of the bill and
say that he would see the potentate taking in
washing before he would waste his substance in
propping up her German relations—how would
that be, O ignorant and cantankerous driveller
with the iron jaw and the fishy eye? And sup-
posing Patterson himself were assaulted in tfle
street and was being jumped on with iron-shod
boots, and nobody would interfere because, by
his own showing, interference in another
man’s disputes is an invention of the devil
—how would that answer? For if it is immoral
and deviLsh for one man to help another to
defend himself against an over-reaching capi-
talist, it is equally immoral to help him to de-
fend himself against a plain street rowdy, and
when The Bulletin sees somebody putting
both his feet in Patterson’s eye it will re-
member that gentleman’s words, and leave him
to attend strictly to his own interests. A prin-
ciple is no good unless it is logically carried out.
Even the system by which an employer in Bris-
bane joins a union and undertaxes to help an
employer in Sydney or Adelaide to 14 carry out
what lie is engaged in ” looks somewhat like an
41 invention ot the devil ” when you examine it
closely ; and when a Melbourne shipowner has
a dispute on, and a butcher or a tailor comes
swarming down, say from Echuca, to bear a
hand in his capacity as a volunteer or some
other gaudy idiot with a gun, that seems also
to be an act of the same infernal character.
And if Patterson’s own grammar isn’t an in-
vention of the devil it is only because that per-
son was tired and in a hurry, and left the job
toffiis apprentice.
On Monday, 6th April, the Federal Convention
reached the crucial clause of the Constitution
Bill, and definitely settled it in a way by which,
we venture to say, the majority have earned
the execration of future generations of Aus-
tralians. By 22 votes to 16, the Convention
decided to refuse co-ordination of power to the
Senate. If this is to be final—and so far as the
Convention is concerned it is necessarily final—
the bloody problem of secession will loom on
the Federal horizon as soon as the requisite
number of States enact the Constitution. To
effect unification is to develope a monstrous
centralisation, which would be tantamount to
handing over the executive power to a syndicate
or ring, such as has controlled the government
of Canada for the last twelve years. And not
only that. Whether it is a good thing or a bad
thing, the fact remains that the several colonies
have developed, each within its own sphere,
certain peculiarities of social construction, com-
mercial progress and industrial development.
No Federal Constitution can annihilate such
characteristics ; what the Convention had to do
was to study and adjust, them—so far from
doing this the denial of State-rights means
the absorption of smaller States by the larger.
Without co-ordination of power the individual
States will have their legislative individuality
nullified by the prevailing tendencies in the
representative chamber. It is said by the
opponents of State equality in the press and in
Convention that the denial of State-right is
essential to the preservation of the absolute and
ultimate will of the democracy. The Bulle-
tin, on the other hand, distinctly avows its
belief in the co-ordination of the States because
it asserts that the democratic principle would
be in danger by subordinating the State-cham*
ber to the House of Representatives. It can
best define its position, and what it thinks
the illogicality of the opposite view, by a simple
arithmetical formula. A New South Wales
elector, a unit of the largest State in the Com-
monwealth, will have 3ff-130ths of representa-
tion in the popular house; in the Senate he
will have l-7th. A W.A. elector, a unit of the
smallest State in the Commonwealth, will have
4-130ths of popular representation, but he has
equally with the other, l-7th of Senatorial. So
far as regards the popular Australian interests,
the man of the lower State is relatively as
amply protected as the unit of the largest, but
in the case of his peculiar and individual
interests, those which are originated by his
residence in his own State—such as, to take an
illustration from America, the interests of a
New Orleans citizen which are now attacked
both by the “ Mafia ” and the Federal Govern-
ment—he has a superior representation to
which he is entitled by reason of the fact that
his peculiar interests and his individual liberties
must ever be dearer to him than the interests
of any other man, even a brother-Australian.
The State equality is the appliance which pro-
tects each individual elector in his dearest and
most intimate concerns. The Conventionists
have been regarding the States Senate not as
representative of distinct political entities
which must remain distinct, but as the tra-
ditional Upper House of the English system.
They could hardly help blundering on this
rock, simply because they were taking charts
laid down by British navigators for their home
seas, with which to pilot the Australias through
the unknown waters that environ the Aus-
tralian future.
+
The Grand Lodge of the Loyal Orange Institu-
tion of New South Wales has given the
“ glorious memory ” of King Billy a rest and
has declared in favour of an Australian Re-
public. In other words, it has solemnly recorded
its disapproval of any form of Australian
federation that “would tend to imperil the
existing relations between these colonies and
the British Crown.” This will be a cruel blow
to the scheming English politicians and the
bogus Australian ditto who have been bribed
with British baubles, and who have been
trying to boom Federation with the one
object of bursting up those same “ exist-
ing relations.” They did count on the
holy Orange mob to howl the loyal- chorus
about pulling tighter the silken bonds, and 10,
the Grand Lodge says: “No, thank you; we
don’t want them pulled tighter. We don’t
want to imperil the existing relations.” That
is just what The Bulletin says. If we are
going to federate, let ns leave our relations
with Great Britain just as they are. At present
the gate of Independence is standing open just
at our elbow, and all we have to do is to step
out when we like, and bid our mother-in-law,
England, an affable “Good morning.” We
don’t want any federation that will imperil that
state of things. But we know, and the men
sitting up in the Macquarie-streeet convention
know, that the vision of ribbons and stars and
baronetcies dancing before their eyes is not
going to materialise itself as a prize for leaving
things as they are. There is a nice little
conspiracy against Australian interests at work,
and we rejoice to see that the Loyal Orangemen
are on the track. They are not going to stand
by and see this young nation trapped into a
lopsided partnership that it might not be able
to scramble out of for generations.
An Ohio (U.S.) politician has drafted a bill
providing that any criminal condemned to
death in that State shall be allowed to choose
one of four modes of extinction, by being hung,
shot, poisoned, or drowned. This is an idea
that some enlightened M.L. A. or M.H.R. might
take up with advantage. If the State insists
on retaining the barbarous policy of capital
punishment it has, at all events, no particular
interest in deciding how the offender is to be got
rid of —it wants to get rid of him anyhow, and
that is all. It can’t borrow any money on the
security of the melancholy “ thud ” which it is
so fond of, and so long as the prisoner is ex-
tinguished it ought to be satisfied. There is a
dreary sameness about the old, mouldered
gallows, and the noseless executioner who
blandly asks his client to 4 4 stand over a bit,
please,” and the greasy rope, and the rest of
the paraphernalia ; and many a blase homicide,
who has used up all the different sensations and
dissipations of life before he took to assassina-
tion, would be glad to try something fresh. If
he prefers to go out into the yard on a bright,
cool morning, and let the State’s man-butcher
plug him with a gun there can be no earthly
reason why his last desire should not be
gratified ; and if he wants instead to be loaded
down with lead, and dropped into a cold,
refreshing tank, the outraged law would get
there just the same. In the matter of poisons
he might be subjected to certain restrictions;
for instance, if he wanted to perish through
some corrosive substance which would make
him yell for 48 hours before he departed, his
request might reasonably enough be refused, for
no man has a right to make himself a common
nuisance ; but anything that would cut him off
without causing unearthly howls should be per-
missible. There would be a little pleasing
variety about death under such conditions as
these ; it would serve to rouse the hangman out
of his moral stagnation, and make the hang-
man’s assistant more spry and limber; and it
would cheer up the sheriff, and brighten the
pensive countenance of the gaol flogger; and
the grave-digger would feel that a faint ripple
had passed over the putrid sea of his dead intel-
ligence. Possibly it might even help to gladden
the chaplain—who can tell ?

At Sydney Her Majesty’s “My Jack”
has turned up trumps after all. Folks who love
to weep even if their feet get wet thereby, who
delight to have their souls harrowed by fiendish
threats, theatrical cyclones or earthquakes and
narrow escapes from blood-curdling horrors,
crowd the auditorium nightly. The circle, how-
ever, doesn’t exactly froth-over into the stalls;
vice is only popular in that part of the house when
practised by a duke and savoury of the divorce-
court, and virtue, especial y when unfortunate
and tearful, has for it few charms. Should we
ever write a melodrama for the dress-circle, it will
contain a land-boom, a gubernatorial lev6e, lots
about “the silken bonds,” several titled
“Johnnies” and heaps of champagne. Arthur
Greenaway, who strained himself through a stage-
accident on opening night, has been obliged to
retire, and his place is tilled by Guyton Heath,
who, if not so Claude Melnottish, weeps with
equal facility—tears that are somewhat more
oleaginous. “The Corsican Brothers ” are getting
very fit in the hands of George Kignold, Edith
Bland et cie and Harry Jewett has got Chateau
Renaud “ down very tine.”

According to popular report, “Bridget
O’Brien, Esq.,” is “ the best place to have a laugh
in town.” That being the general impression,
biz. is good at Sydney Garrick, where Vincent
West’s expansive smile suggests the ticket-office
and his spiked moustache is a stumbling-block to
deadheads. A strong feature of the show is the
bright, lively music. That of the preliminary
movement to the Sappho ballet, it may be remem-
bered, was transcribed from the phonograph by
Conductor Robertson in Melbourne. Perhaps the
best vocal item is the “Little Peach ” duet, be-
tween Johnny Sheridan and Gracie Whiteford,
first made known to fame, if we are rightly
informed, per medium of Ered. Leslie and Nellie
Earren at London Gaiety. Now we want the
Widow to tell us why she lets the play fall with a
sickening thud while the variety business takes
the Hour? This hiatus breaks the continuity and
interferes with the riohoray iffict av the tooton-
shamble. The Bovis’s “ Dora, Dorer, I love you,”
is a clever item, but their costoorn suggests a
bier-garten, and their slippers are a moving
menace to Day and Martin. Signor Imano is in
such good voice that it is a pity he ham t more
singing to do, and the Widdy’s only fault is that
she is not enough in evidence. No change in the
bJI is mooted.

The Sydney public have been so often
deceived by illusive preliminary puffs, that we
were inclined to view with incredulity the flatter-
ing press-notices from South Africa and England
that arrived here in advance of the Misses Albu.
Having heard them, however, we are conquered,
and freely admit their excellence. It is rarely
that you find so much technical skill allied to such
vocal freshness and power. Julie, the taller of
the two, is a willowy young woman, graceful and
of fine stage presence, who has a clear, resonant,
highly-cultivated voice of great range and flexi-
bility. Her chief fault is a straining for effect,
chiefly shown in sustained dwelling on finals.
One specimen of long drawn-out sweetness as
a sample oi reserve force is admissible,
but with frequent repetition effect is lost and
monotony achieved. This is especially true of
ballad-singing. Simplicity is the ballad’s key-
note, sympathy its predominant feature. Rose
Albu’s voice is lower-set than that of her sister;
it is fuller at its base and slightly metallic at its
apex and probably will eventually develope into a
true mezzo. But it is also highly cultivated and
managed delicately and with much feeling. At
their opening concert these young ladies were
assisted by Miss Apollino Niay, a scholarship
holder and exhibitioner of the Royal Colleg®
of Music, who has lately settled down is
Sydney to teach the pianoforte. Miss Niay has
evidently a thorough acquaintance with the techni-
calities of her profession, and should be well
patronised. The Y.M.G.A. concerts, although
the Albus were supported by fair representatives
of local talent, were not successful from any but
an artistic point of view, and they open this even-
ing (Thursday) at Sydney Town Hall where it is
to be hoped that they will reap the reward that
exceptional natural ability, when allied to the
artistic skill born of severe discipline, deserves.
The accompanist is Miss Naylor.

“Dr. Bill” has established a wonderful
practice at Adelaide, and his pat ents are
thoroughly satisfied with his mode of treatment,
even although the company that handles Aide’s
farcical comedy is in almost every respect inferior
to the B. and B. interpreters. Teddy Royce is
funny enough, but streets away from George
Anson. Inman, as Dr. Bill, doesn’t seem to
thoroughly grasp situations, and Harry Diver,
who appears as George Webster, looks silly
enough for admission to any lunatic asylum.
Charlie Brown, as Mr. Horton, is appropriately
boisterous, while Edwin Kelly as the servant
helps to keep the fun up. Marie Brooke has
made a great success as Miss Eauntleroy, but
Mrs. Walter Hill as Mrs. Firman, is usually “ not
at home.” Polly Emery is a capital Ellen, but
Maud Appleton’s monotonous voice goes sadly
against her. Myra Kemble found it necessary to
absent herself for one evening, and her part was
undertaken at very short notice by Miss Harrie

Each of the Melbourne theatres was able
to renew its bill on Saturday night, a most un-
usual state of things in these hard times. But
ere the present issue of The Bulletin has ap-
peared, in all its rosy splendour, above the horizon
there will be another change at the Bijou, where
“Masks and Fac s” was to discontinue a mild
career after Tuesday. Of the people employed in
dragging the heavy stage-coach along the old ruts,
only Miss Emma Bronton grew fresher as they
neared their journey’s end. Most of the others
began—in the language of sporting literature—to
hang out signals of distress, which were received
by select audiences in a spirit of reciprocity.
Even Miss Achurcli’s effort on the light fantastic
too (at Triplet’s lodgings) seemed to get more
fantastic, and less light, with each successive
struggle, and the advertising of this sombre
sh. file as an Irish jig reads like another nasty
jar for Parnell. Enough of such sad memories,
h wever. Ibsen’s “D ll’s House,” that beautiful
story of a mother’s love in three rollicking acts,
was due last (Wednesday) night, and perchance it
may run for more than the allotted three perform-
ances. Many Melbourne women are seeking a
sound philosophical-reason for giving the old man
an 1 family the slip, and if they like to hurry up
and sit at the feet of Ibsen, bedad ! they will hear
of something to their advantage. Possibly, too,
there is a general desire to gaze once again upon
the entertaining person who wants to slink away
into a dark corner to die of his hereditary disease,
and the associated bank-clerks of Melbourne
certainly ought to rally round their Norwegian
brother in affliction, who talks so cheerfully of
descending to the gutter when he receives a week’s
notice. Fortune may smile, as the scoffers are
sure to do, upon this revival of “A Doll’s House,”
and in that case there will be no necessity to pro-
duce “The Wager” on Saturday, for the last
week of the Charringtonian season.

Still harping on the Bijou— the matinee
benefit to Miss Aston was the huge financial
success anticipated by all careful students of
sassiety sympathy. In the artistic way Snazelle,
with his “Leper” recitation, seemed, perhaps,
the most popular thing, while the programme in
other respects was “varied, interesting and in-
structive.” Especially instructive. Being gra-
tuitously printed by the local Punch, it contained
the gratuitous information that that same
periodical— of which it is impossible to speak
without.**™ in one’s eyes—is the noblest weekly
Publication in Australia.

“Moths” is getting its due measure of
appreciation at the Royal, for only the very upper
regions were other than crowded out on Saturday
night. The shilling pit has been resuscitated with
good results, and with this return to the old order
of things has come an all round state of pros-
perity, the more remarkable because it is so well
deserved. There is an air of thoroughness about
this handsome show. The ladies are elegantly
accoutred for the giddy fray, and Sass shoots his
linen with the same calm deliberation that charac-
terises Cautley’s handling of his hat. Also, the
last-named artist has a way of inflating his chest
which stamps him as a songster out of the
common, and although the audience have to take
ms phenomenal warble for granted, they feel that
the heaving bosom carries conviction with it. An
opera-tenor whose notes combined the sweetness
of the nightingale with the rich swell of an organ
(vide Ouida) would no doubt have a demonstrative
bust like Cautley’s. Prince Zouroff’s pants are
less satisfactory than Correze’s palpitations, but
then it isn’t the tailor who makes a royal Russian
libertine, and Charles Cartwright, considered
apart from his wardrobe, is a genuine success.
Miss JNlethersole, too, has somewhat toned down
the mannerisms that mar her beautiful perform-
ance ; whilst all the other roses retain their early
bloom and fragrance. “Moths” is indeed a
fascinating entertainment, containing as much
polished naughtiness as one can reasonably expect.

‘ I alka ’ appears to be crowding Mel-
bourne Opera House night after night, notwith-
standing that the opera gets but a moderate
reception considering the many pairs of hands on
the premises. The more subtle signs and indica-
tions of a prolonged run are not there in fact, but
as the management constantly announces “ House
r nil m bold characters, without exceeding the
strict truth, there is every reason to suppose
that they feel happy and thank their “stars”
accordingly. The show sails down a rippling
stream of melody on an even keel, and if the wind
of public favour showed a disposition to abate,
the steam-tug Age would be towing it along all
the same. John Gourlay is less highly chalked
and otherwise a more taking Tancred than on the
first night. Why Falka (being a romantic school-
girl with a soaring imagination) should elope with
an odd-looking youth rather shorter than her
little self remains a mystery dark as ever, but the
chorus of sixty voices is delightfully comprehen-
sible, ditto a largely-augmented orchestra and
other first-class fittings.

Strange incident at London Royal Italian Opera
recently. Madame Roze, in the boxes, missed a valuable

conjuring*.
Contractor David Mitchell (the diva's papa) scratched
his head a good deal when he read the cable-lie that the

sub-editor) ever heard of a woman having a valet, as a
valet in the English sense of the word ?
Comic opera has a strong hold on Melbourne. When
“Tom Jones” and the “Gondoliers” were young together
they seemed to form a mutual improvement society in
business, and now “ Pepita ” and “ Falka ” oppose. The
rival stage-managers are Bracy and Wallace. Bracy has
the latest London experience, but then Wallace 'dates
from the Noachian deluge, and so it is a toss-up espe-
cially in affability. Which do we like best—Wallace's
st.ile or Bracy s now which? It is choosing between
Lord Chesterfield and Sir Hubert Stanley.
“Agitate ! Agitate !” Such was the hoarse whisper of

An Open Letter.
(To the Proprietors and Editors of the New
South Wales Press.)
Bentlemen, —You, if we are to believe your
own words and the eloquence of post-prandial
orators, occupy a position in our state second in
point of potency to none. I, who venture to
address you, am simply what my signature
imports me to be—a creature who waits on
your beck and call, to whom your smile is bread
and butter, and your frown starvation. A cat
may look at a king without timidity, but a
scribbler may not approach you without a
quickened heart-beat and a tremulousness of
the knees, for the scribbler is less than the
grimalkin, whose living may be obtained with-
out sacrifice of independence. But you are
greater than the King. For you are, gentle-
men, are you not, the Power behind the
throne ?
# * *
You are, gentlemen, peculiarly the Annalists
of the people. Noble function ! —to record with
a single eye to truth and to posterity (which
can never rightly know itself unless it under-
stands the time out of which it has arisen) the
deeds of the present. You are, also, the
Teachers of the People. Nobler function still !
—to guide the unthinking masses, to stimulate
the dormant intelligence, to suggest the good,
to correct the evil. And once more, gentlemen,
you are the Defenders of the People’s liberty.
Noblest of all functions ! —nobler, indeed, than
that of the Fidei Defensor, for a faith is a
limitation, a restriction on liberty ; and the
liberty to know, to utter and to argue freely,
according to conscience, is the highest preroga-
tive of the human identity. You assert this
and are prepared to defend it, are you not, so
long as you have an ounce of printing paper left
for a wad and a leaden type to act as a bullet'?
These functions are yours, gentlemen, and never
yet were greater or more momentous associated
with any mundane institution. Pope or Kaiser
never claimed .efficacy of a diviner sort. And
never since the Dark 'Ages has there been Pope
or Kaiser who had his claim admitted as fully
as the popular voice has sanctioned your claim.
The people have learnt the lesson your fore-
runners suffered to teach them —that in paying
a penny for a newspaper they purchased not a
broad-sheet, but a, Palladium, an MCgis, and a
Gonfalon.
* * »
This power and these functions are yours,
gentlemen. There is not one among you but
has at some time exercised the power and
assumed the functions, and neither is there one
of you who has refrained from proclaiming to
the uttermost bounds of your area of publicity
the fact that you have done the one and the
other. The meanest rag ever issued by the
most contemptible of your members —a man
may be a journalist, a teacher, and a defender of
public liberty, and still be personally con-
temptible (Marat was all these things)—has
boasted again and again that it was at once the
repository of popular rights, the shield of public
liberties, and a standard flaunting in the van of
progress. The boast is, of course, well founded,
but even if it were not, a statement only
requires constant reiteration to be installed as a
clause in the creed both of the men who make
it and the people who hear it.
# * *
Filling these onerous and benignant functions
and administering this tremendous power, no
one has ever yet taunted you with abusing your
right. You have shown yourselves almost
superhuman in the massiveness of your self-
restraint. The attitude of magnanimity, whose
lack flaws the most lustrous fame, can justly be
claimed by you. Owning a giant’s strength,
you have scorned to use it like a giant. For
when did you ever lift your united hands to
wrest from the State a privilege, or from the
Law an immunity ? When did you ever abuse
the public confidence ! When did you
ever exert your own forces to secure
a concession for your class ! Among
the whole series of classes which Mother
Earth has spawned you stand alone. You are
unique. Never, since the first historian penned
his first lie has there existed a class which so
persistently declined to attract to itself and its
parasites such good things as were going; never
' one that, holding a monopoly of power within
its grasp, let it fall as though it were valueless;
never a class which, constituting also a craft or
profession, neglected to entrench its business
interests behind the bulwarks of etiquette;
never a class which, entitled to take an inch,
did not consciously strive to seize an ell. To
you, gentlemen, as a class, which is also a pro-
fession, it has been reserved to manifest this
abstinence. No one would ever dare to cast
upon you the imputation that your class inter-
ests and monopolies endanger those of the rest
of the public. You are magnificent in your
magnanimity.
* * *
But you will, perhaps, pardon the query ; Is
it not possible to have too much of a good
thing? May magnanimity itself not prove a
weakness if carried to an extreme ? In an age
which is nothing if not mercantile and competi-
tive, is it altogether a virtue to refuse oppor-
tunities of strengthening a professional position
when, with professional interests, is bound up
the wider welfare of the public at large •
Remember, gentlemen, you do not stand or fab
alone. With you in decadence or progress must
go the people, for are you not their Annalist,
their Teacher and their Defender ? To weaken
you as a class and a profession is to weaken the
State, and in your admirable anxiety that the
State should not suffer from any undue aggres-
siveness or selfishness on your part, have you
not gone too far towards the other extreme ?
Have you not fallen short of that middle point
which the commonest instinct of self-respect
will define as the meeting-place of just assertion
and unjust aggression ? If you have, then the
State is already injured, for your obligation to
it demands that you shall maintain yourselves
in unsapped strength. You can sin by weak-
ness as well as by presuming on your might.
Of the two, in this world of hard knocks and
strenuous wrestlings, the sin of weakness is the
more shameful.
# * *
And, gentlemen, this more shameful sin is
yours. Your magnanimity is magnificent, but it
is that of a lick-spittle. You have been so
tenderly solicitous of popular interests that you
have forgotten your own good and your own
dignity, and in so forgetting have overlooked
the fact that when the interests of the humblest
individual in the State (even of a hireling
scribe or the proprietor of a newsrag) are un-
protected, the interests of the State as a whole
are endangered just as the fruit is unsound
when the tiniest spot of corruption specks the
rind. Moreover, how can you be strong enough
to guard popular rights and popular liberties
when you are so weak that you invite the
popular contempt for yourselves as a class and
that a profession? Now a re-action has set in and
that you are the object of public ridicule and dis-
dain, instead of being regarded with public
reverence, is patent to every critical mind. This
is the reward of your abstinence and your
magnanimity, and I for one am not going to say
that it is not richly deserved.
* # *
For if you were strong in self-respect and
conscious of your own dignity you would never

for one thing have permitted the iniquitous Press
Laws of New South Wales to remain on the
Statute-books. For another you would never
have accepted that half-condescending toler-
ance which public men extend to you. For a
third you would never consent to live in the
pockets of advertising-agents, and at the mercy
of the “ mammoth ” advertisers who for a full
“ double-column ad.” can now purchase your
bodies, and, with a “half-page till counter-
manded,” could buy your soul.
# * *
Let us come to the point. The other day a
man—a hired scribbler —-“doing time” for an
offence against a Press Law, and under a sen-
tence so brutal that it startled even the prose-
cutor, was removed from Sydney to Maitland
gaol ironed by hand and leg to a felon. In
prison clothing, fettered and manacled, and in
the glare of the public gaze, this man was trans-
ferred from one prison to another. There may
have been “valid departmental reasons” for
this outrage; there are “valid departmental
reasons ” extant for the prostitution of imported
females which are only not in force because there
are no transported females to apply them to.
But whether there were reasons or no reasons
is not the point. The point is that you—you,
the members of a profession engaged in the
noblest of tasks, of a class entrusted with the
most momentous of public functions—have
allowed this outrage to pass unnoticed, not to
say undenounced. May I ask what insult, if
any, would arouse you to a sense of manliness ?
& # #
Reseigh Martin is now to be released after
serving one-half his monstrous sentence. No
thanks to you; you almost unprotestingly
allowed him to go to gaol for an offence which
every one has committed or is liable to commit
by the purest accident at any moment—he
gave credence and publication to a float-
ing rumour which thousands of people
beside himself believed—and as a class you
have never moved the length of a barley-corn
to secure his release or to relieve the sufferings
inflicted upon his innocent relatives in conse-
quence of a sentence which not even the most
callous or brainless of you declares to be just.
That accusation awaits your answer, though
Reseigh Martin should be freed while it is
being framed. Your answer. But dare you
answer it ? When . the Authorities treated
Martin as a felon, they registered an imputa-
tion against your class—your profession. V\ hen
they shackled him they simply put into use, on
the dormant spirit of the Press, laws which date
from the time of the First Blackguard of Europe,
and which were framed to meet the exigency
that arose when bold men dared to tell ‘ ‘ that
sceptred Thing,” that profligate and liar though
he might be in private life, as a monarch he
ought not to be a scoundrel and a perjuiei.
And when the Authorities ironed Martin, they
constructively placed the “ darbies ” on you, oh
brother journalists ! If Martin wore them
justly, then not one of you but should be simi-
larly decked.
* * *
The Authorities literally put fetters on the
journalist. Figuratively they do the same
to you every hour of every day, and you accept
this position. You, the “ Fourth Estate, the
Leaders and Teachers of the people, the
Defenders of Popular Rights and so forth have
not sufficient esprit de corps, professional in-
stinct, or sense of self-respect to assert your-
selves and your liberties under the most brutal,
unjust, and shameful of insults.

It is said that several “ teams ” of bottled

Some W.A. Chinese lately quarrelled
over a game of cards. One of them feeling
agrieved sharpened up the tomahawk and went
for ” the other three heathens. The first man was
out into mince-raeat, the second was deprived of
two ears, a leg, and an arm, but the tomahawk-
man seeing the third Celestial making tracks for
the bush transferred his attentions to the owner
of the flying pigtail, and when he was done with
him the one thing wanted was the undertaker
Result: two deaths and one mutilated survivor
who may live to give some explanation of the
tragic event. The strangest part of the affair is
the fact that the murderer promptly walked into
the nearest township and gave himself up to the
police.
Business in almost every line may be
deadly dull, but the “ guinea-pig ” vocation
flourishes like a green bay-tree. A certain
N.S.W. silver mining property, in the early days
of local silver-raining somehow got itself into a
financial tangle, and to rectify matters it was
decided to let the mine on tribute. This decision
was carried into effect, but the salaried directors
stick to their posts as of yore. They kindly act
as receivers of tribute, and pocket fat fees for
doing so. They sit regularly once a fortnight, and
humbly divide a trifle of about £lO between them.
The business transacted at these meetings suffices
to kill about five minutes valuable time, which
means a cost to the Co. of £2 a minute or so. The
names of the directors deserve to be recorded in
letters of brass.
Sophia Gunsberg, the last prominent
Nihilist who came to grief, was evidently an
inventive female, and if she had kept her head in
the crisis of her conspiracy there would have been
an opening for a new Czar. She was a beautiful
woman, with innumerable lovers, and she con-
ceived the brilliant idea of sending them all out —
unknown to each other —to prospect for the Em-
peror with guns or bombs or poison, having first
assured each one that she would marry him when
Alexander was wiped out. In the course of a few
weeks she had about a dozen young Russians on
the Czar’s track, and among them all his chance
would not have amounted to much—only it hap-
pened that at the supreme moment Sophia went
the way of all womankind, and really fell in love.
Instead of sending her last mash along with the
rest to go shooting at a monarch, she eloped with
him ; and when the other dozen heard of it they
grew dissatisfied and gave the scheme away.
They gave Sophia away, too, and did it so badly
that they saved nothing out of the wreck—not
even themselves. The end of it was that the lady
is imprisoned for life in a dark, damp cell, and
the twelve or fourteen youths who used to buy
hot chestnuts for her, and hang round her house at
night for Hie sake of s eingher shadow on the
blind, have all been started off to Siberia.

That before the law the Squatter was the same as you or

You’ve got to ask your gaffer where your sympathies
should go.
Your heart, your purse, your conscience to their keeping
you must bring—
Why, it’s even getting hotter than when George the First

When George the First was King, when George
the First was King ;
Why, it’s even getting hotter than when George
the First was King.
But keep your heads and tempers, boys. Your time will
come again,
Remember that your breath has made and can rramake
these men ;
When they’ve to face the ballot-box it’s mighty small
they’ll sing,
These men who’d drag us backward to the time when
George was King.
It’s mighty small they’ll sing, my hoys ; it’s
mighty small they’ll sing,
These men who’d drag us backwards to the time
when George was King.
Then keep your heads I say, my boys ; your comrades in
the town
Will help you yet to win a vote and put your tyrants
down.
Throw your old guns aside, my boys, the ballot is a thing
They did not have to reckon with when George the First
was King.
The ballot is the thing, my boys, the ballot is the
thing
Will show these men how long it is since George
the First was King.
Rockhampton, March 26.
W. KIDBTUN.
Mr. Clements Explains.
Many people have expressed surprise that Clem-
ents Tonic has met with such wonderful and un-
precedented success in such a short time. The
explanation is simple—it is genuine. I saw the
thousands of worthless hogswill American
nostrums flooding the Australian market year by
year, month by month, day by day, and knew that
a great amount of money left these shores annually
in return for these rubbishy articles, all of which
made the country so much the poorer. I also
knew that the exigencies of life in this country
and the climate necessitated the use of an artificial
bloodmaker to restore the normal condition and
vital forces which were so enervated by climatic
and other influences. I also saw the thin, pale,
delicate, and attenuated men and women of Aus-
tralian cities, and studied the causes and ways
and means of remedying the evil; I saw that it
was impossible to bring the article required into
popular favour except in the form of a patent
medicine. I knew of the thousands of pounds
spent by the public annually in purchasing inert
and sometimes harmful concoctions of worthless
ingredients, and asked myself —Why can’t we
manufacture the article the public require, and
make it of genuine and best materials, and give
an article which will do the good which other
makers only claim that theirs will do? I knew
that such a remedy could be made, and that unless
it met with public approval great loss must result.
However, I determined to venture on its introduc-
tion, and thus Clements Tonic came to be made,
and in the short space of two years it has spread
over the whole face of this continent. It is sold
in every store in Australasia as freely as in
Sydney : and the mere fact of its enormous sale
in this city is proof positive of its virtues, for no
article can command a great sale at the home of
its birth unless it is absolutely and conclusively
proved to be genuine. Clements Tonic has re-
placed every other article offered, and has the
largest consumption tenfold of any other Aus-
tralian medicine; and this is not due to the
advertising expenditure of its proprietor, but to
its pure, undisputed merit. Fellow Australians,
we don’t want the Yankee quack to dump his
ship-loads of clap-trap fooleries and cure-alls on
our Australian shores, and fool us with his
smooth tongue and plausible humbug ; neither do
we want him to suck the vitality and marrow out
of our people with his consignments of chemical
slops, which, with spacious plausibility, he
guarantees to cure everything from epilepsy to
impecuniosity. We want a genuine article, made
in our own land, by our own people, bought with
our own money ; then the money remains in our
own country, and the country is so much the
richer thereby, and we all have a chance of
handling it again; whereas, if it once gets into
the rapacious maw of the Yankee quack, farewell!
it is gone for ever. I know my article is genuine,
and that it contains the material to make it cure
disease where disease is curable. You may
depend upon it that if Clements Tonic fails, all
others must fail. I can.produce hundreds of
proofs of the truth of my statements and the
virtues of mv remedy. F. M. Clements, New-
town, N.S.W.
“It is worth its weight in gold,” is a common
expression. But, while the value of gold is easily

The Henty, barbered by Mortimer Frank-
lyn, was Herbert, son-in-law of the recently-
deceased Sir Francis Murphy. His brother Henry
went to England, leaving the £90,000, or so, in
their partnership, but Mortimer nobbled the lot
for the World and Federal Australian, and
has the impudence to claim the authorship
of the “Commonwealth.”
If the ducal rents keep going up at their
present rate the grandson of the existing Duke of
Westminster should live to possess an income of
£20,000 a day. And as he then will be grabbing
ono subsistence—;according to English rates—of
292,000 persons, there will be exactly 292,000
reasons why the said Duke should be hanged out
of the road without ceremony.

The death of Major Bromhead, hero of
Rorke’s Drift, was lately recorded. At the time
, ,at really gallant affair he had been a lieuten-
ant iz years, and since then he has been a Major
years, making 24 years’ service. Contrast this
itn TI.K.H. the Shook, who was with Prince
on Plon Napoleon in the Crimea. Bromhead
did good work in Burmah, after Africa, but, like
Gordon, he was the wrong sort to promote.
Harold Mallalieu, the young Nyngan
homicide, who claims that he slew his victim in
hot blood and in self-defence as the outcome of a
dispute on the labour question, went under the
alias of “Michael Black,” in a vain endeavour,
perhaps, to escape the bad fortune imposed upon
him by the person responsible for christening
him “Harold.” All Harolds have been singularly
unlucky—from the Saxon Harold downwards.
Inseparably enwreathed with the new
eight hours’ memorial, Melbourne, must be the
name of James Galloway, the founder. He died
at 32, and Ids monument is in the Melbourne
cemetery. But his absolute claim, as single
originator, is disputed, though the stonemasons,
to whom he belonged, admittedly have the glory.
The old, well-known banner of 35 years ago is still
carried at the head of the annual eight-hour pro-
cession.
One of Melbourne’s good women is the
appropriately-named Widow Bon, friend of the
Aborigines, and referred to by the officialdom of
the past as “a most pestiferous woman,” but she
gained the victory, with Graham Berry’s assist-
ance as Chief (Secretary. Between them they
settled the point that no aboriginal on Ooranderrk
Station, or elsewhere, is to be made to work. Mrs.
Bon, being a rich squatteress, could never be
snuffed out.
About three years ago The Bulletin pub-
lished a statement from a London correspondent
that General Booth was a Jew. It is now alleged
by a Melbourne paper that Barnardo and Booth
are both Jews. However, the statement that 18
years ago the latter was a hard-fisted pawn-
broker’s clerk, “ who would only lend 355. on a
watch upon which you could get £2 anywhere
else,” is absurd, in face of what is widely known
about Booth’s history.
It is related that “on being introjooced ”

Hon. John William Fortescue, son of Earl

when N.Z. Governor, has been writing in Nine-

Australia.” A Sunday paper;—At a N.Z.
country hotel a bush bummer asked him to shout.
“Do you know who I am?” demanded the irate
aide-de-camp; “I am the hon. Mr. Fortescue.”
“ Don’t care a d if you’re the dishonourable

adds our Sunday contemporary, he is shouting
again.
Mr. Justice Windeyer, as the oldest
graduate of the Sydney University, was loudly
cheered at the University crews' dinner on Satur-
day evening. The Justice has quite survived Sir
William (then Mister) Maeleay’s memorable jibe
uttered many years ago during a debate in the
New South Wales Assembly on something con-
nected with the finance of Sydney University, of
which institution Mr. Windeyer was then the
only graduate ; —“ The State has expended so
many”—we forget how many—“thousands, of
pounds,” said Mr. Macleay, “and that’’-point-
ing to Mr. Windeyer, who sat opposite—“is all
we’ve got for it.”

The Convention delegates, having got over
their reverence for Parkes’ hair, loudly express
their wonder that so apparently shallow a person
should have had “ so long a run ” in N.S. Wales
Premier Parkes literally squirmed in his
seat at the Federal Convention on hearing Sir
George Grey’s notice of motion that the Constitu-
tion should be submitted to a plebiscite of the
Australian people.
“Freedom of contract,” as it is under-

Some instructive ideas on the value of

Disgraceful disloyalty in Melbourne Trades

A Newcastle (Eng.) paper states that
the wooden-looking and uproarious Patterson is
bound to be Premier of Victoria at a very early
date. And, strangely enough, Patterson was in
Newcastle at the time, and had been interviewing
the editor. It is a very small individual indeed
who can’t pass himself off as a coming Premier
when he is 16,000 miles away from the people who
would see him boiled first.
Sir Arthur Hunter Palmer, K.C. M.G.,
President of the Legislative Council of Queens-
land, and Acting-Governor of that province, ap-
peared before a Land Court in Brisbane the other
day and “ridiculed the idea” that a Dividing
Commissioner could have ridden over one of his
runs “in 18 days, travelling at the rate of 35
miles per day.” Palmer’s class also ridicule the
idea that landless working men have any real
grievance.
Brewer Fitzgerald, of Victoria, who, by
the way, is newly-related to the British nobility
by marriage, characterised Doctor Cockburn’s
proposal that the basis of the Commonwealth
should be one-man-one-vote “as a pure piece of
impudence.” Apropos, South Australia, and New
Zealand are now on a one-man-one-vote basis, and
Victoria, South Australia and Queensland are
committed to the same thing, so far as their
existing Governments go.
If the Labour party—which represents a
large majority of the vox populi —wishes to rule
and upset the reign of a minority, who hold sway
simply by splitting the majority into sections,
the cardinal principle to be observed must be
that, in future, on’y one issue shall he fought out at
a time at the ballot-box. The classes skilfully pre-
vent the domination of the masses by introducing
conflicting side issues, when a direct vote is
required on the subject of social reconstruction.
Just look at these two preambles. This :
Wo, the people of the United States, in order to form a
more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic
tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote
the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to

Constitution for the United States of America.
And this :
Whereas the Australasian Colonies of ... . have

wealth under the Crown under the United Kingdom of

A difference in the ring, isn’t there?
Dear Bulletin, —This is how public
opinion goes in the country. A cricket-match was
being played, the other day, at a place called
Cookardihia, about midway been Wagga and
\lbury. After the match, when the opposing
teams met at the local pub. and the usual toasts
of “ Visitors,” “ Captains,” “ Umpires and
Scorers,” &c., had been got through, the captain of
the visiting team got up and proposed the toast of
“The Coming Australian Republic.” The
enthusiastic way in which that toast was received
would have turned Government House green.
There were about 40 present, and not one man in
the room refrained from cheering ! —Scotty.
Two extracts from same issue of Sydney
D.T., from same set of telegrams and referring to
same subject:—
A railway porter at Baroaldine, who refused to be sworn
in as a special constable, has been dismissed. In all, seven
railway employes have been dismissed for aiding and
abetting the strikers.
Three magistrates were travelling along the Central
line to-day swearing in as special constables all the rail-
way employes who were willing to be sworn.
A S.M. Herald telegram of same date reads :—
None of the men offered any objection to being sworn
in.
Of course, they didn’t.
At the Convention :—
Sir George Grey contended that the right of the Con-
vention was to make this federation a perfect machine,
lie denied that this principle of one man one vote should
be left for others to get for them.
Mr. Baker: Is New Zealand intending to join the
federation ?
Sir Georgs Grey: New Zealand wishes to have the
power to do so, and wishes, therefore, to enter into a
commonwealth of which it approves. lie asked why this
right had been kept from the people so long?
Members; Who kept it?
Sir George Grey: Why evade a debate by a question
like that ? lion, members all knew who had withheld it—
the legislatures, which did not properly represent the
people.
The Federal Convention cannot safeguard
the Commonwealth in the matter of defence, for
this reason—the Governor-General, if appointed
by the Crown, is Commander-in-Chief by virtue
of his commission. , The Convention cannot
delimit his powers, because the act of delimita-
te n would ho.ultra vires. The Cabinet Ministry
of the Commonwealth might decline to dispose of
or even call out tiro Federal military forces, but
yet, according to law, the Governor-General
would have the authority to do so, and any officer
or man refusing to obey the Commander-in-Chief’s
order would he mutinous. The military and naval
forces of the Commonwealth will not be under the
control of t'm Commonwealth’s Parliament. The
Parliament’s only check on the abuse of the mili-
tary power will be that of supplies.

Why did he leave it to The Bulletin to suggest—
with its tongue in its cheek —that Her Most

the loyalty of her loving antipodean subjects. If
Henniker had only struck the idea, he might have

W hen the first accounts of the sad. disaster
at Middle Head reached the public, many people
were under the impression that the fatal mine
w vs exploded by Lady .Terser.
r our luon —joieurc.iaiits Hamuiand and
Bedford, Corporal M‘Kee, R.E., and Bugler
Charles Bennett—were blown to atoms by°the
explosion. They were engaged with eight others
in a boat in laying guncotton mines to replace
two which had been fired by Lady Jersey earlier
in the day. Of the twelve men, but two escaped
uninjured. The party had laid one mine and,
'Having rowed to some distance, ventured to
explode it. However, “the cables must have
been confused,” and the guncotton, still slung to
the boat-side, was fired instead of the mine beneath
the water. The bodies of the dead were simply
blown to rags, and Lieutenant Hammand’s wife
witnessed her husband’s death from the shore, as
did also several hundreds of civilian spectators.
The military court of inquiry sat in the
evening with closed doors. " Colonel Do
Wolski, head of the N.S. Wales military
engineers, when interviewed that evening, said
it was absurd to have such demonstrations, not
for the benefit of the soldiers, but for the amuse-
ment of the public and officials. The pastime, he
remarked, was an altogether illegitimate one :
The banqueting and junketing in consequence of this
business spells ruin to solid work. There was bungling
and those in the boat evidently got hold of the wrong
end of the cable. . So long as the men fire these
hasty charges merely for the purposes of a picnic, merely
for the purposes of a public demonstration, you must ex-
pect the possibilities of accident. The fact is, we ought
not to do anything which is not in the service. We should
not do all this and run these risks merely to give ladies
a fine, pleasant afternoon.
Now, what does all this mean? We do not know
what Colonel De Wolski intends it to signify, but
the general public, which has heard so much of,
if it has not actual personally experienced, the
copious libations attendant on Australian soldier-
ing, has jumped to a certain conclusion concerning
the cause of this lamentable disaster. It is much
to be regretted that it has been decided to hold no
inquest or public enquiry.

One of the most exciting incidents yet
recorded in connection with New South
Wales militarism occurred some years ago.
An officer, by profession a schoolmaster,
and therefore doubly a martinet, loved to look
upon the rum when it was red, and was in
the habit, when ids battery of artillery were on
the roads, of pulling them up outside public-
houses while he went in to give himself a drink.
Late one afternoon he and his gallant follower 8
passed through Waverley, where their commande r
gave the usual “ Halt!” for the usual reason, but
the battery had been pulled up often enough that
day—they were tired and wanted to get home, so
they took no notice: whereupon the gallant officer
rode along and, brandishing his huge cavalry-
sword at the throat of the driver of the first gun,
said: “ Wretch, stop or die !” Th wretch turned
white and stopped, whereupon Captain B. went
in and said he thought he really would have a
little more rum.
* * *
Captain B.’s battery, by the way, con-
tained at that time a very dainty-looking little
man with a Jersey-coloured beard, who had
mincing, purring little ways of his own, and
actually took with him to the annual camp a pair
of kid boots and a frilled nightshirt. Before the
troops had been in camp half-a-week it was dis-
covered that the pretty little man with the frilled
nightgown was the hangman’s assistant. Never
judge a man by his nightgown.

The Australian Club (Sydney) is supposed

Although on the Statute-book, capital
punishment is virtually abolished in South Aus-

If you want final and. convincing proof
that the Englishman is the noblest work of the
Creator, the place to look for it is at the Mildura
(Yic.) irrigation-colony. The population for tbe
greater part consists of the class from which the
jackeroo used to be recruited. Every ship brings
out a draft of English youngsters who have been
too good, or too bad, or too stupid to earn their
living in the dear old country, and have been
packed off to the swell settlement to save trouble.
The place is essentially English, and on a Satur-
day afternoon (following the arrival of the Eng-
lish mail with the remittances) you will see more
Piccadilly panoply and more scientific cane-suck-
ing than on a spring afternoon in Collins-street.
There is a considerable proportion of duffers
among them, but a few give promise of growing
into men. It is worth noting that “colonials”
hold nearly all the responsible positions. The
head accountant, the bank-manager, the school-
master, the lawyer, the two editors, one of the
doctors, the four surveyors, the auctioneers, the
four architects, and the station manager are all
Australians. In fact, wherever brains, energy,
and executive ability are essentials, that is where
someone other than an Englishman has to be ap-
pointed. The water-inaster is a Swede, the head
planter is a Swiss, and the majority of the other
bosses are either Canadian or Australian. Which
shows that the British lion has a tail.
A few nights ago the adherents of Mildura
Anglican Church met to hold a pow-wow about
the subject of building a synagogue. It was
suggested that an architect should be requested to
design an elevation to be examined at a future
meeting. One of the devout present—a most
exaggerated masher, recently imported from the
city of four-storey collars and balloon-pants—was
suddenly attacked with an idea which, among a
wilderness of haws and lisps, found expression in
a suggestion that the man should be instructed to

The beastly colonials cacchinated promptly and
violently, and the presiding parson, after an
honest attempt to assume a pained and sepulchral
aspect, had to let go and join. There was a great
awakening, and serious business had to be sus-
pended. It is even betting that the Belgravian
product doesn’t see it yet.

The volatile Sir William Robinson intends
tearing himself away from W.A. on a three-
months’ leave of absence, and it is believed he will
not return from England, when ho gets there.
Lady Robinson remains at Perth for the present,
which strikes one as a strange reversal of the usual
order of things :
“ Observant but Illiterate ” is a remarkable
letter in a Melbourne paper, a few days back.
The writer lately got work as hospital-attendant,
and comments on the medical causes of death,
“ bronchitis,” and so on, which, he says, should in
two-thirds of the cases be written down as simply
Poverty.

The cable gave us, the other day, a simple
word-picture of the Nitrate King and Court con-
fidentially proclaiming from the housetops their
intention to buy Tasmanian silver-mine shares at
an early date. If Colonel North has indeed
noised his project abroad it is Lombard-street to a
china-orange that he has got his shares already
and feels a strange yearning to unload ’em. The
cable-yarn reads altogether too much like a North
windfall for this deserving young country.

Bush residents have at times to put up
with queer medical attendance. The other day a
doctor in a N.S.W. Southern town, having cadged
many drinks on the ground of illness, went
round the local hotels —there were nine—and had
a second nip at each. Later in the day he was at
the blacksmith’s when a newly-married couple
went by. “Look here, doctor,” said the town
wag, “if you’ll go after those two on all-fours
and bark like a dog I’ll shout for you.” “Shout
for me? Will you? Well, here goes.” And
down he went on all-fours and followed behind
the blushing pair with his “ Bow-wow-wow ” all
the way to the first public-house, where he waited
for and duly got his drink.

Klock Yung Gee, of Ballarat (Vic.), applied
for a divorce the other day, and prepared the case
himself on a dirty piece of brown paper, with the
corner eaten off and a grease-mark in the centre.
The statement ran thus : “Too muchey talkee
with neighbours, too muchey paint face, too
muchey dlink Yulopean blandy, too muchey fight,
too muchey snore in sleep, too muchey boss, too
muchey say killum husband, too muchey no good,

At the half-yearly meeting of the N.S.W.
Civil Service Co-operative Society, held last week,
a resolution was carried giving the directors the
noble sum of £3OO to be divided among them. A
large number of the relatives and friend-- of the
directors were present on this happy occasion, A
lot of shareholders—who were too indolent to
turn up at the meeting—-now threaten trouble.

“ Dagonct,” of London Referee, sizes up
the lately-deceased Duke of Somerset: —
He was the second oldest duke in the kingdom. He
was a harmless old gentleman who came to live in
Brighton two or three months ago, and was not at all the
sort of person one would have suspected of being a duke,
unless one had been told that a duke was living in the
house he came out of or went into. Even then the
curious in such matters might have mistaken the other
gentleman, the one who opened the door and surveyed
outside mankind with such chilling indifference, for the
representative of all the Seymours. I have seen several
gentlemen all staying at the same time in the cheap
boarding-house round the corner, any one of whom was
far more like the conventional idea cf an English duke
than was the Duke of Somerset.
Which merely goes to show that the conventional
idea of a duke is dreadfully wrong. There is still
a certain hazy impression floating about that a
duke is a tali and stately individual who is always
throwing up entrenchments somewhere, or cast-
ing off his allegiance, or charging wildly upon the
enemy; whereas he is generally a little, fuzzy,
muddle-headed old man who dodders about on
two uncertain legs, with Ids pants turned up at
the feet, and trails a big umbrella behind him like
an addled devil dragging his weary tail along the
gutter. And the lofty individual with the noble
features that theworld takes for a duke is the assist-
ant at a second-rate barber's shop, and the only
thing he does with his kingly countenance is to
open it when he asks if you will have your hair
short at the back.

“Billy” Heffernan, who died the other
day at Dunedin (Maoriland), has left a void
among the old identities of Bendigo, for that
golden city will never grow another individual
like him. He was of a vast and unfathomable
age, and was proud of his antiquity, and as a rule
he tacked on a year to his record every month or
six weeks, so that his friends could almost hear
him growing old. When he died he must have
counted about 250 years. While he was still an
unsophisticated child of 125 or so he made his pile
and lost it again ; he was a big shareholder in the
Great Extended Hustlers mine at a time when
that delusive claim seemed to be a solid hunk of
gold, and he suffered from a conviction that it
was going to last for ever. Then there came a
sudden end to the boom, and Heffernan was left
with SOOlbs of unsaleable scrip in every wildcat
mine around Bendigo, and a big mortgage on his
famous Shamrock Hotel. Ho consoled him-
self for the loss of his fortune by growing old
more violently than ever, and his favourite amuse-
ment was to sit on the capacious balcony of the
Shamrock and listen to his years accumulating.
He was an authority on all raining matters, and
by his valuable advice he assisted the writer of
this paragraph to get into a complicated specula-
tion in which he might have made £lO, and
couldn’t lose more than £6OO. Having lost the
£6OO, the said writer lowered his bag out of the
window by a string and fled on foot to Kangaroo

Sullen the surge of the old, old sea
On which the old, old moon was beaming,
And the old, old tide crept stealthily
To where the lovers sat a-dreaming.
Some explanation this demands—
The twain were squatting on the sands.
And he was young and she was fair
(The old, old thing in humdrum verses.)
The sea-spray kissed the slumbrous air,
The seagull croaked his mystic curses.
When little rhymes like this we spin
We always work the seagull in.
Their hearts beat time to the olden tune,
The tune that Eve brought into fashion ;
And Love’s own self caught up the rune,
And every breeze was hot with passion.
“ Rune ” always in the third verse goes,
But what it means—well, goodness knows.
The old, old darkness came at last
To fling its cloak round forms that shivered,
They sat and sat like ghosts aghast,
And quaked the while the light’ning quivered.
You’ll not deny, of course (who could ?)
That “ ghosts aghast ” is rather good.
The red sun rose in the old, old way,
The seagull cursed more loud and shrilly,
As the old, old morn broke cold and grey
On man and maid, who’d both gone silly.
Thfl fact, perchance, you have discerned—
’Twas I, the bard, whose head was turned.

Giddy great composer,
Is the cause sub rosa
Why you spread your pinions,
And to colder regions fly ?
Come behind the curtain—
Let us know for certain —
Won’t you tell us why, Robin,
Won’t you tell us why ?

The proprietor of Pearson’s Weekly
lately offered a “ prize of a wife and a hundred a
year” for competition among bachelor subscribers.
After selecting from among a van-load of photos,
and testimonials several eligible ladies for inspec-
tion, carriage paid, they (Pearson and his wife)
picked cut a plum. Then came a bitch. Hun-
dreds of would-be husbands (Woman’s World tells
the tale) had sent in their names—retired officers
of both services, ex-Indian civilians, and a decided
preponderance of parsons who are always
“there” on such occasions. A certain number of
gentlemen wore selected —were introduced to the
young lady, and entertained at tea by her mother
in one of the suburbs of London. Pints of tea
and pounds of cake were thus consumed. Still
the suits came; but the right man came not, and
seemed never likely to come. After weeks of
interviewing and rejecting by the chosen lady,
and an expenditure of large sums in travelling-
expenses, Mr. Pearson was obliged to withdraw
the offer and admit that his novel form of matri-
monial agency had proved a failure. Now he
declares that his only mistake lay in selecting a
woman “so excellent, so sensible, and self-
respecting that no husband is good enough for
her. ”

The two Mormon elders who turned up
at Towoomba (Q.) the other day and managed to
gather an audience of 100 at the local Masonic
Hall, were dismal young men who snuffled texts
and talked dreary solemnities for over an hour,
but never told the bright gathering of expectant
girls who formed a big blushing contingent of the
meeting a word about love, or courtship, or mar-
riage, or harems, or anything that makes this
wicked world sinfully endurable. Even the M.P.
present voted the show a frost, and long before
the Saints had got half through, all but a half-
dozen or so had adjourned to carry out their own
notions of religious exercises adown the moonlit
paths afar from the township’s shadows. Every
Mormon missionary is a hamstrung cripple ever
since the Church in Utah abolished polygamy for
veiled concubinage, and his cross is hard to bear.

who, having had both arms dreadfully crushed in
a machine, declined to take chloroform, and
smoked his pipe while both limbs were being
amputated by a surgeon.

Some London papers laugh at the notion
that “Bill” Gumming was bounced into signing a
confession of cheating. They say that William
loves a row, that battle and fighting are to him as
the very breatli of his own nostrils, that it is al-
most incredible that any male being, no matter
how exalted, could have made any insinuation
against him without being thrashed ; and the man
or woman who can frighten William into doing
anything in any way repugnant to his feelings or
harmful to his interests has yet to be born.
Apropos, when the beautiful Miss Minnie
Stephens, the American millionairess, first arrived
in England she was eagaged to be married to one
of the Marlborough H«use set, who was caught
red-handed cheating at cards at Nice. Gordon-
Cumming, who is poor for his social status, tried
hard to marry the rich Yankee, Miss Leiter, but
he failed to catch her even with the aid of
“ Wales.”
# * *
The question (says a London press corres-
pondent) is fiercely disputed as to who it was that
violated the compact of secrecy in regard to the
Cordon-Gumming scandal—
The story which survives all others in authority is that
the day after the exposure “Wales” drove over to tea
with a certain lady, to whom he confided the facts, she in
turn confiding them some time afterwards to her bosom
friend, a youthful peeress. The latter was adored by a
certain baronet, familiarly known as “Topps,” and some
weeks later Gordon-Cumming, who has a sarcastic tongue,
happening to see the pair together, jokingly observed to
the lady, “When your husband’s dead I hope Topps will
make an honest woman of you.” He little knew that his
silly jest was a home-thrust, and would he resented
accordingly. But resented it was, the intensely indig-
nant lady taking her revenge in the form of a publication
to all and sundry of the Tranby-Croffc scandal.
The Bulletin doesn’t publish this so much as an
item of news, as for the purpose of illustrating the
morals of high society as indicated by its conver-
sation. Lord Ronald Gower is understood to be
the Australasian’s correspondent.

A Melbourne scribe describes that indes-
cribable dance—the “larrikin waltz”; “ One of
the sights of popular demonstration days is the
larrikin waltz. On the one side you have an
aggregation of undersized, loathsome - looking
weeds in high-heeled boots, gaudy-coloured neck-
ties, and bell-bottomed trousers; on the other a
crowd of dwarfed factory-girls with faces so hard
that you could strike sparks from them almost.
They tangle themselves together in some remark-
able fashion, and gyrate. The young lady keeps
her head well on one side, not so much from
maiden modesty as to get out of range of the
young man’s breath. By the evening they are all
more or less drunk, and you scarcely wonder that
a social reformer, coming across such a scene,
elects to give mankind up in despair and let it
go to perdition in its own way.”
One of the things which Her Gracious will
not endure is to have any married woman about
her who wears her hair hanging down her back.
Consequently, ladies attached to the Imperial
Court have to keep their thatch in a knob, or else
clear out. There is a legend that one lady in-
waiting,” or “ woman of the bedchamber, or
“ maid-of-honour,” or some similar official who
held an appointment about the royal establish-
ment, appeared with her golden locks streaming
over her shoulders, and when she was remonstrated
with, she seized her wet umbrella, which had been
standing up against the throne to drip, and said
emphatically: “Victoria, you’re too confoundedly
particular. This ain’t your hair.” Then she
crowded her goloshes into her bag, looked sternly
at the royal countenance through her green spec-
tacles, and grasping her trunk and her port-
manteau disappeared down the stair. And as she
disappeared the Queen, in a voice stifled with
indignation, instructed the Equerry of the Cold
Meat Department to hang on like mad to the bell,
and inform the First Lord of the Coal and Wood
to tell the Baron at the front door that if that
awful woman called again Her Majesty was out,
and she wasn’t to be allowed to wait. i bis
anecdote is probably untrue, seeing that we in-
vented it ourselves, but it is as thrilling and as
reliable as royal anecdotes in general.

The correct thing now in fashionable
circles in America is for a girl to present her
future husband with plaster-oasts of her hands
and feet. It is needless to mention that, so far as
the feet are concerned, these images are a hollow
lie and an imposture, for the fashionable girl is
not yet born wh) would deliberately present her
betrothed with a statue of her corns and bunions.
The oasts all show five perfectly-formed toes, and
a daintily-arched instep, and a skin as smooth as
polished ivory. But sometimes a dubious lover
takes the plaster hoof for a reality, and marries
on the strength of it; and when he finds that th
genuine extremity is large and cold, and horribl
on a winter night, lie realises that he has bee •>
cold. Then he skirmishes for a divorce on thn
ground that the lady’s feet weren’t up to sample.

Early last week, when the shearing row
was suffering a temporary lull, and there was no
news from the Federal Convention, and no ’orrid
murder, and everything was stagnant, the daily
papers had to fill up with the old, old cablegram
about Russia “massing troops on the Austrian
frontier.” About four years ago that diseased
assertion used to appear in print almost daily,
but it has dropped out of sight recently, and it
was a shock to see the enamelled and painted face
of the familiar, wrinkled lie glaring out of the
same old column.

An American judge says the man who
would not perjure himself to save a woman cannot

Dicey’s “Law of the Constitution” says
that “ Bradlaugh re-discovered the law of main-

plained the character of a penal action ; enabled
us to define with precision the relation between
the House of Commons and the courts of the
land; has gone far to make intelligible the
legal character and solemnity of an oath._ His
failure or success are from this point of view at
least equally advantageous to the nation, and
will, one may reflect with satisfaction, equally
ensure to him his appropriate reward. He will
obtain, or rather he has obtained legal immortality
Everywhere there are signs of royalty dying
out: The United States and Mexico, solid Re-
publics ; collapse of opposition to French Republic;
stability in Republics of South America, includ-
ing Brazil; Portugal looming up, as necessary
sequence. Only by clerical political dominance
can the Republic be choked, for the time, in Bel-
gium. Spain follows Portugal. French influence
cannot be ultimately resisted in Spain and Italy.
Infant monarchs in Holland, Spain, Servia, and
the Belgian and Austrian succession both spoilt.
Russia weltering. At least two-fifths of the
British population openly Republican. Germany
evidently on the verge of a terrible crisis, through
the Emperor’s fear of the Socialists alienating
from him successively Bismarck, Waldersee, and
Caprivi. Bismarck going into Parliament on the
suffrage—an indisputable sign of Democracy’s
march. Impossibility of fixing up the Turkish
peninsula otherwise than as a Republic. Move-
ment even in India. Canada and Newfoundland
yearning for the United States. Lastly, Aus-
tralia’s “ Commonwealth.”
When the late Jack Macrossan, M.L.A.,
was digging in Ravenswood and his “ hatter’s ”
claim didn’t turn out well, he struck a new line as
a general scrivener—many and many a love-letter
came from his pen—for illiterate diggers. His
“office’’was a flimsy “ put-up,” but it gathered
him in much coin, and, what was more valuable
still, procured for him an intimate “ family friend-
ship” with hundreds. Ravenswood was then a
vivid green, as regards the majority of its popula-
tion, and the pick-handed Irish prospector whose
fist was awkward at the pen, was Macrcssan’s
most numerous and regular client, every monthly-
mail time, when it was fashionable “to sind a bit
uv a wroiting and a pound or two ” to the “ ould
sod.” Those were the days when miners had
voting-papers to enable them to exercise their
electoral franchise. Before an election, organisa-
tions of diggers—one Orange, t’other Green—used
to send out forage-parties whose mission was to
bounce or steal voting-tickets and record them at
the polling-booths. In 1873, Jack Macrossan was
returned to Parliament, and, once in, he managed
to stick.
Why a Panic?
A leading financier was recently asked, “ what
makes a financial panic ?” He tersely replied :
“It is simply a lack of confidence.” The com-
merce of the world is the creature of confidence.
One-tenth, perhaps, of large business transactions
arc made in currency ; the other nine-tenths are
accomplished through the medium of personal
cheques —mere pledges of confidence. Business
would come to a standstill if currency was generally
demanded. There isn’t enough of it to go round.
A panic arises when men, losing confidence,
demand currency instead of cheques, the currency
cannot be had—-there isn’t enough of it, and the
banks lock up what there is. Confidence is the
basis of commercial prosperity. The most in-
telligent people bank the heaviest on confidence,
and prosperity follows. The singular thing is that
sometimes, men who prosper in thus placing con-
fidence in their fellows in business transactions
act as though in other matters of even greater
moment, no reliance could be placed in them. If
you believe what straightforward business men
say, there need be no panic about kidney disease.
It is curable. Mr. N. S. Parmintier, Warehouse-
man, writes : Glen Osmond, Adelaide, l9th
November, 1890. —Ever since my arrival in the
colony, now some four years since, I have suffered
from an aggravated liver complaint, combined
with a serious affection of the kidneys. After
the use of four bottles of Warner’s safe cure, I had
gained weight, and my pains materially subsided,
and when I had taken 12 bottles all symptoms of
kidney disease were effectually removed. The
Mayor of Albany, West Australia, Robert Muir,
Esq., says:— For a considerable time I have suf-
fered from a disorder of the kidneys, together
with a number of other distressing symptoms.
With the use of three bottles of Warner’s Safe
Cure every trace of kidney disease was removed.
Writes Mr. Arthur J. Diamond, manager for
Messrs. Tolley & Co., Limited, of Ereemantle,
W.A., 11th December. 1890.—For two or three
years I have on and off suffered from an affection
of tin kidneys. I have taken, as occasion re-
quired it, about twelve bottles of Warner’s safe
cure with results fully satisfactory, and can
highly recommend its use. Are not state-
ments of this character, voluntarily made by
reputable business men, worthy of confidence
If not, why not ?
Many people seeing the words “Microbe
Killer” have been led to believe that it is a
disinfectant. It is not a disinfectant, but a
powerful medicine, for while it kills the germs of
disease, it does it in a different manner. It is
taken internally or applied externally as the case
may require. It attacks and kills the microbes in
the system which are the direct cause of disease.
After these germs are destroyed the medicine will
thoroughly cleanse the blood and tone up the
whole system—in short, it restores to a healthy
condition all the members of the body. Although
this medicine has only been for sale in Australia
a short time the constantly increasing sales bear
witness to the-good it is accomplishing. People
who have been using the Microbe Killer for con-
sumption, kidney and liver troubles, indigestion,
and, in fact, for almost every disease, are loud in
their praises of its virtue. Being composed of
pure water charged with powerful germ destroy-
ing gases it is as pleasant to drink as pure spring
water. Send for the book, “History of Microbes
and the Microbe Killer,” posted free. The head
office is 40 Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, but
agencies have been established at 319 George-
street, Sydney ; 17 Hunter-street, Newcastle;
and 2(5 Queen-street, Brisbane, where the medicine
can be obtained.*

JOHN H. NATHAN, General Manager.
rjio THE ELECTORS OF EAST SYDNEY.
Gentlemen, —
Impelled by the strongest feelings of a desire to
render some service to the country at the present
time, I offer myself as a CANDIDATE for the
vacancy caused by the lamented death of the late
John R. Street. Esq.
At this election the premier constituency of the
colony should speak with no uncertain sound.
Every question hitherto before the public sinks
into insignificance when the liberties of the people
are threatened by the audacious proposal now
being promulgated for the federation of the
colonies. I say “ audacious ” advisedly, because
there is absolute certainty that the freedom and
independence we now so happily possess will be
imperilled, and that instead of being ruled as we
were, from D iwning-street before we obtained
responsible Government, we shall be ruled and
governed from the Parliamentary-buildings in
Spring-street, Melbourne, or from some other
junior colony.
I rest my candidature as a protest against
parting with the blessings of liberty we now have.
1 f the Federation as proposed becomes law, the
seat of our government will go, and our grand old
city of Sydney will be ruthlessly deprived of its
well-earned prestige and of much of its trade. In my
judgment, also, the value of property will be
much depreciated, and the general interests of the
great b dy of the people of the colony will be
ser.ously damaged.
I trust that you will sink every other question
at the present time, and by your emphatic vote in
my favour show that this wild and profligate
scheme is disapproved by you.
As a large property owner, and having large
commercial interests throughout the colony, and
in consideration of my far wider range of sen-
timent springing from my long years’ resi-
dence and labour amongst the people of the colony
generally, my candidature I trust will not be un-
acceptable to the large majority of my fellow-
citizens.
Yours faithfully,
WALTER BRADLEY.

(Alias Mr. W. A. STEEL, the well-known ARISTO-
CRATIC TOUT;, who also sent out
HIGHBORN! HIGHBORN! HIGHBORN!
to ALL his SUBSCRIBERS, and to EVERYONE in his
Monday morning’s wires also.
AFTER this, and coming AFTER his recent V.R.C.
prognostications, WHAT need to ask WHO IS NOW the
CHAMPION Tipster of Australia ?
ANNUAL SUBSCRIBERS of £5 ss. receive all such
information as the above WEEKS before the events take
place, as Mr. S. points them out in his WEEKLY
LETTERS to SUBSCRIBERS, hence it is much to the
advantage of sportsmen TO JOIN HIS SUBSCRIPTION
LIST.
Terms now reduced to 10s. for a wire ANY race-day,
with REALLY RELIABLE SELECTIONS, sent out bv
IX o’clock on the morning of the race to ANY address or
to the grand stand; or, THE INFORMATION may be
had each morning by calling at address at foot.
Mr. S. varies very much from all other tipsters, inas-
much as he NEVER gives more than ONE horse in a race.
Mr. Steel advises THIS WEEK over:—
HAWKESBURY MEETING on THURSDAY and
SATURDAY, 9th and 11th inst.
SOUTH AUSTRALIAN MEETING on 11th inst.
DANDENONG and ELSTERNWICK MEETINGS,
9th and 11th inst.
SST’ Some REAL GOOD THINGS for all the above

Send for Mr. S.’s circular, wherein he demonstrates bv
COMMON SENSE WHY he MUST be in a better position
than ANY «>THER Turf Adviser to impart REALLY re-
liable information.
HAWKESBURY HANDICAP.
A “DEAD SNIP,” only 10s.

information has been obtained only at the greatest expense
and trouble.

816 Macquarie-street North, Sydney, April 8,1891.
My Dear Moorabinda,—
Lady Jersey is an unaffected woman, almost too devoid
of airs for a community which isn’t given to adoring those
in high and purely ornamental places-instance the
manner in which her ladyship addresses her husband by
his Christian name before any crowd. At a big public
show the other day she brought the Earl to “ attention”
by simply (and rather sharply, too) saying “George!”
and the way His Ex. jumped showed who really promised
to love, honour, and obey. Owing to this public fami-
liarity on the part of “M. E. Jersey,” LordJ. is becoming
familiarly known as “George”; and another of its bane-
ful effects is that a well-known magnate who is addicted
to loudly calling his wife by her front name in public is
now encouraged to do it more frequently than ever.
It is as I feared—that portion of society which imitates
vice-regality from the shoe-latchet to the top curl, has
taken violently to what maybe called the Lady Jersey
twitch. It consists of a—er—sniffing movement of the
nostrils accompanied by a slight wag of the head, and
now Sydney society has got hold of it and the late
fashionable stony composure has been shattered into
fragments. As people are thus sheepishly imitative of a
vice-regal peculiarity why don’t they copy it still further
and give their faces a rest from powder and pigments?
Since no longer we have an unimpeachable precedent for
floured noses and ripe-radish cheeks it behoves society
to wash its face and make holocaust of its pearl cream if
it doesn’t want to be mistaken for Tottie.
Lord and Lady Carington presented a pair of diamond
bracelets to Miss Horsfall on the occasion of her weddin"
with Brother Hu pert, and Lady C. also gave the bride her
bay hunter and brown pony. Mrs. “ Ru.” will not, after
all, be separated from her people by the marriage as the
Hon. Rupert No. 1, intends to take up wool-raising in
Riverina where their connubial tent is to be pitched.
The Union Club bachelors led off the race-week ball
festivities with their dance on 31st ultimo at Need’s
rooms, which were thrillingly decorated for the occasion
with pampas, fairy-lights, silk, palms, etc., the dressing,
although the evening was wet, being good. No particular
colour had precedence, long trains were not so much
worn by dancers as they were last year, bouquets (some
very beautiful) were generally carried, and flowers were
worn in the hair. Lord and Lady Jersey were present.
The first Albu concert at Sydney Y.M.0.A., on 31st ult.,
was sparsely attended, although, as the ladies are both
powerful sopranos, they are sure to attract larger audi-
ences when their fame spreads abroad. There is nothin"
the Sydney “ musical ” groundlings like better than to be
pierced and riddled with song as it were, and both Miss
Julie and Miss Rose (pretty women of the Hebrew tvpe)
vocalise in a strenuous way that makes the windows rattle.
It may be said that their pronunciation is good, and that
they attack the sound correctly, and, perhaps, if one
heard them in the Town Hall in soli of the a""ressive
sort, where tenderness of tone was not required, one might
be able to say something very nice; but when a songster,
with a vocal organ as strong as an average chorus, attends
more to force than fervour, people whose “ Crown of
sorrow is rememb’ring happier things ” feel inclined to
wad their ears.
But when all is said, how very few women there are
who sing other than mechanically, with a strong inclina-
to yell? The average woman grinds out pages of
eroticism with no more heart in her voice than "if she
were a tin goddess vocalising by steam, and she is always
more addicted to roll ng her eyes than exercising her
soul. The obvious reason is the feminine lack of, or fear of
originality. Women study a song now as to how it affects
their tutor, and the result is parrotish, even though everv
dot, pause and modulation is faithfully put in.
Thursday at Randwick was off-day in every sense'of the
word, for the rain blew all over the stand and the lawn
hissed and gurgled beneath the feet of fashion, which
couldn’t help revealing as it took a hurried promenade to
keep its nose from turning “green,” that it wore its
silken underskirts tucked. But even on that clammy day
there was a ten-thousand attendance, and the vice-re"al
party were there—not exactly in all their glory, but"as
near to it as circumstances would permit. Lady Jersey
wore a summerish costume in cream trimmed with gold
and silver embroidery under a grey mackintosh, sur-
mounted by a lion net in silver straw trimmed with white
chiffon and pink roses, white fall with a black spot; the
little Jerseys in white and fawn frocks with fawn straw
hats trimmed with fawn ribbon, check mackintoshes with
silk-lined hoods. But the interest centred in Mrs.
Rupert Carington, who occupied a seat in the vice-regal
box until brother Rupert (who looks positively beatific
111 his new character as Benedict) took her away to intro-
duce her to the Members’ Stand. Mrs. “Ru ” i s a slim,
medium-sized lady with very dark hair, a rather
petite face, and small, bright blue eyes. She wore a well-
fitting black gown, the bodice and sleeves trimmed with
the new jewel trimming in “sapphires” set in “gold,”
necksoarf of blue chiffon, black feathered hat with
touches of blue. There was very little dressing. Lady
Innes looked cold in green and cream silk with buttercups
m her bonnet; Lady Constance Combe appeared in an
unseasonable thin pink silk, with black hat; a pretty
society girl had got up a rather striking s watch toilet iii
brown and yellow which suited her perfectly; and a gold-
washed matron in brown had painted herself like a clown
-whitewashed nose and chin, cracking carmine lips, pen-
tailed brows and flaming cheeks.
The usual throng of women, most of them having en-
cored their frocking, made Randwick radiant on the last
day of the autumn meeting, which possesses a kind of
awful attraction for the young man with the sloping fore-
head who is always morally certain that he’s going to
“ pick-it-all-up-yer-know,” and is generally seen negotiat.
ing the home beat on his large tan feet. Sassiety turned
out in battalions, though vice-royalty was not present;
but the dressing pointed the moral that Lady Carington’s
fatal habit of wearing only one frock until creation
groaned has entered into the soul of local highflyers, and
most of the furbelows were old friends. Lady Constance
Combe wore pinkish tweed ; Mrs. Burdekin, in her recep-
tion twilight, with the addition of a lavender gamp ; Mrs.
Rupert Clarke, in a cream silk gown embroidered at the
edge of the flounces and across the bodice with bunches
of violets and leaves, leghorn hat and feathers, green
chiffon gamp ; Mrs. (Dr.) Bowker, in dark-blue with a
mottled pattern in brown circles, bonnet with lavender
butterfles ; Miss Bowker, in green with scarf of maize and
blue chiffon, black hat; Miss Nellie Hill, in blue and
green tartan made with a vest of green silk, black Tor-
eador hat, with pompoms and tartan gamp en suite ; Miss
Ethel Lamb, in white with blue chiffon scarf, black hat
trimmed with kingfishers ; Miss Fosbury, amethyst cloth
and velvet, black hat with touches of amethyst; Miss
Marks, in royal blue cloth braided in black with black
girdle, black hat trimmed with grey birds; Mrs. W.
Carson, in fawn and red flecked cheviot, vest in red,
black and fawn, fawn felt hat trimmed with birds; Miss
Maud Galbraith (with Mrs. E. Terry’s party), in moonshine
green trimmed with emerald velvet, hat to match ; Carrie
■Swain, dark purple velvet, flat grey felt with grey and
purple feathers, etc. Quite a feature of the afternoon
was the music, which, though not high class, was very
sweet, a selection from “Gondoliers” being rendered
most soothingly.
Now, as to what will be autumnally the “go” in Sydney
(always shown at the Sydney autumn meeting) it is
certain that straight plain skirts finished with a deep hem
stitched in silk, with Newmarket coats with pockets and
buttoning over frontally to reveal sometimes a dicky and
necktie, and small Toreador hats trimmed with pompoms
to match the costume, will reign all winter. Such an
ugly wooden, relentless sort of style was never before
seen outside Noah’s Ark or stained glass, and the woman
with wide feet who comes forth in the new board-like
skirt with no final frill to break the line of her imposing
pedestals, will be severely criticised as she goes over the
mud.
1 am told on the very worst authority that a Sydney
Government Department intends shortly to engage a
whole horde of lady “ typewritists ” who are going to be
a “great economy to the country”—of course. It is
woman’s unalterable fate, apparently, to undersell her
brother in the labour-market, and there seems to be no
cure for it. Your Sappho is no petticoat politician, still
it is plain enough even to me that if women demanded
men’s wages they might do so until everything turned
green, since men would get the work and the malcontents
might go and hang their typewriters on the willow, in
this particular instance.
There is another side to the Celestial cook-question. A
an up-country surveyor’s tent the other day the “boss’’
sent John, the Chinee cook, packing, calling him sundry
uncomplimentary epithets which at last roused him to
retaliate, “Who are you calling dirty debbil ? Me! no
feah, you dirty debbil! Y'ou eatee anythiny." Which,
considering how graphically The Bulletin has shown how
Chinese cooks make stuffing, was raFner a well-merited
facer, don’t you think ?
The Jerseys’ maiden ball on 2nd inst. was attended by
all the COO invited guests, though the evening was dread-
fully wet at starting-hour—half-past nine o’clock. The
ball was in one sense not a great success, as too many
invitations had been issued, and the crush was dreadfuh
besides which lots of “ lovely waltzes” had to be sat out,
willy-nilly, on the piazza, which was cosily arranged with
many flirtation nooks. The ball was opened with the
usual square, Lord Jersey dancing with Mrs. P. O. Fysh,
Lady Jersey with Treasurer M'Millan (report hath it that
he is engaged to be re-married), Sir George Innes with
Lady Jersey’s eldest daughter, and Mr. Fysh with Lady
Innes. Some of the dressing was good. Lady Jersey was
in wine-red brocade mingled with ivory satin and gold and
silver passementerie, diamond ornaments and bouquet of
cream and crimson roses and ferns tied with the two colours
—the two little Jerseys (some people with fixed ideas on
the subject of the age of debutantes were rather sur-
prised to see them in the festive swim) in cream surah
frocks with lace insertion and long sashes; Mrs. Rupert
Carington and Mrs. Billyard Leake wore their bridal
array; Mrs. Forbes Angus appeared in sunset silk and
roses; Mrs. Burdekin wore a trained gown of cream
satin brocade, &c., &0., &o. ; most of the striking gowns
having done duty at the Bachelors' ball. The next dance
is to happen on 10th inst.
Mayoress Burdekin’s farewell public reception in the
Centennial Hall was singularly free from the lady in red
satin and black curls who brings her daughter in blue and
yellow, and her niece in pea-green. But the frocking
was nearly all resurrected racing-gown. Mrs. Burdekin
wore a white grass-cloth embossed in white silk flowers
and trimmed with silver passementerie, flat hat trimmed
with mauve chiffon, and carried a magnificent presenta-
tion-bouquet of white flowers and maidenhair; Miss
Burdekin appeared in grey figured pongee and gold and
silver insertion, white hat with butterfly-bow of white
chiffon ; Lady Innes in smoke-grey and primrose, the
neck finished with gold braid, primrose chiffon parasol
and buttercups in hat; Mrs. A. J. Riley in black and
vieux-rose; Miss Blomfleld in green silk and gold
passementerie ; Mrs. Haviland Reynolds in black jetted
silk, bonnet en suite ; Miss Frances Saville in heliotrope
brocade made with a deml-train, and trimmed with
puffings of heliotrope chiffon, bonnet in black and lilac
blossoms; Miss 51. Windeyer in rock-melon-yellow with
embroidery yoke, white hat and feathers; Mrs. Robert
Guy in heliotrope silk—and so on, ad infinitum. The
usual array of cakes and ale was furnished forth in the
cold and silent tomb-I mean the basement—which gave
quite a ghoulish air to the feeding—indeed, one woman
with long, grey fangs, who was gnawing her way through
a large, yellow apple, looked, in the damp gloom of the
place, so like an afreet making a meal of a human skull
that your Sappho was glad to hurry upstairs again where
a band was pelting dance-music at the crowd from the
gallery.
Miss Jessie Ackerman, the vigorous temperance advo-
cate, who keeps the road clear for her cause by hitting
adverse critics with her umbrella, gave a well-padded
lecture, on “The Women of Asia,” on 2nd inst., assisted
by well-known Sydney ladies, en costume. The lecture
was not all original, being mostly cut-and-dried informa'
tion to be found in any book of Eastern travel, but it seemed
to suit the audience, which was headed by Bishop and
Miss Saumaurez Smith, and the Sydney ladies were
all there to be looked at. One temperance Yum Yum
(though she hadn’t the Nellie Stewart toddle) looked very
Japanesy, paint and all, in grey silk gown beautifully
embroidered but fortunately without three pins in her
hair—which would never have done in a Christian
gathering. And then we had a model of a Chinese bride, a
silent figure robed in red from head to heel, topped by a
flat, red hat, the face entirely concealed by a fringe,
which drew forth pitying remarks all round ; but I
couldn’t help thinking how much more modest she looked
than our own decollette sacrifices on the altar of Hymen.
There is no dressing in the “ Schoolmistress ” at Sydney
Criterion—excepting Maggie Moore’s final splendour of
theatrical mauve and white and gold—and whatever does
Pattie Brown (who has recommenced rolling her eyes so
violently that one wouldn’t be surprised to see the con-
ductor handing them back to her on a fork) mean by
appearing as a governess in the first act in a seedy brown
wrapper with the flounce pinned up here and there and a
dingy handkerchief hanging out of her pocket? It quite
destroys the probabilities, since governesses—like bank,
clerks - are obliged to keep neat and smooth and un.
patched on ten shillings a week.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
A Melbourne woman has entered an assault-charge
against her butcher, but all the corroborative evidence she
can procure is that of a neighbour who saw her scudding
down the street throwing mutton chops at the fast-
retreating tradesman.
On the vice-regal visit to Campbelltovvn Encampment
on 31st ult., Lady Jersey wore heliotrope silk figured in
white and trimmed with darker velvet, bonnet en suite;
tbe little Jerseys in white frocks and blue sashes, white
hats trimmed with chiffon.

The marriage of Mr. Arthur Allen and Miss Ethel Lamb
will be solemnised in England, whither both culprits
shortly repair. Miss eight’s wedding with Captain
Barlow will take place in Sydney on an early date.
A number of society people are engaged in working up
a monster benefit for Signor and Signora Majeroni, who
have lately met with great misfortunes in the way of
illness. The undertaking is one which will meet with
cordial sympathy from the theatrical profession, the
public and the press.
They say the Ladies Estella and Dorothea Hope, now
departing for England, have milked six cows every morn-
ing before breakfast, at Mount Macedon. And yet we
have let these gals go out of the country !
Some ladies visited the new Melbourne Cathedral the
other day and were fascinated by the gorgeous altar-
cloth. One asks the verger whether it was made in Mel-
bourne. “ Oh, no, ma’am, it is from England, of course.
You could not get anything of that kind here.” After-
wards they found the cloth was made in Adelaide. The
verger was from Hingland, of course.
A lady slipped down at a Victorian railway-station,
struck her head against the train, and was taken up much
discomposed, but the gallant and thoughtful station-
master came running over with a looking-glass and ex-
claimed, “See, madam, you are not disfigured in the
least!” What a lovely story !
There were few spectators at Rupert Carington’s wed-
ding, but all who saw it agree that the bridegroom looked
quite lonely without a straw in his mouth
The “rustling-skirt” is the very latest. The frou-frou

the underskirt.
Bezique is the great gambling game among English
ladies. “ Rubicon bezique,” played with four packs, is
the most popular and latest development.
A Melbourne “society” organ lias just distinguished
itself by chronicling in detail the marriage of Hon. James
Williamson’s second daughter with Mr. Francis Power, ot
Melbourne Mint, which it says took place on Ist April!
The bridal gown is microscopically described, also the
bridesmaids’ frocks and the bridegroom's gifts of moon-
stone brooches ; finally, we have details of the wedding-
breakfast and of the bride’s tailor-made travelling-gown.
The day after the alleged marriage the bride walked in
Collins street. The paper had anticipated the wedding
by exactly a week, at the end whereof—that is to say on
April Stir—ail that had been mentioned in prophecy by
the Erodzky would no doubt happen.

A NURSE’S REPORT.
Medical men say that a good nurse in a difficult
case is better than medicine, but when we can get
a good nurse and good medicine, the patient
stands a much better chance of recovery. The
few words of advice given below by Nurse Eliza
King, of Great Massingham, Swaffham, are well
worthy the attention of all readers of this paper.
They are as follows : “I have constantly used St.
Jacobs oil in the various situations I have occupied
as nurse, and have invariably found it exQellent
in a'l cases requiring outward ai plications, such
as sprains, bruises, rheumatic affections, neuralgia,
&c. In cases of pleur sy it is an excellent remedy
well rubbed in. I can strongly recommend it,
after several years’ use and experience. It should
be in every household.” Sister Carolina, St.
Andrew’s Hospital, Glewer, Windsor, writes : “I
take this opportunity of stating that I have found
St. Jacobs oil a must efficacious remedy in gout;
also in sprain and bruises. Indeed, we cannot
say too much in its praise, and our doctor is order'
ing it constantly.”
Henry and Ann Bright, hon. superintendents
of the North London Home for Aged Christian
Blind Women, say that the remedy has proved itself
unfailing; that rheumatism and neuralgia have,
in every case, been removed by St. Jacobs oil—
the remedy referred to —and that many old ladies,
some of them 90 years old, instead of tossing about
in agony, now enjoy a good night’s rest through
its influence. Mrs. Bright says she cannot say
enough in its favor.
Six gold medals have been awarded to St.
Jacobs oil for its marvellous power to relieve and
cure pain. It acts like magic. It cures when
everything else has failed. It has cured people
who have been lame and crippled with pain over
twenty years. It cures rheumatism, neuralgia,
faceachc, backache, sprains, and other bodily
pains. It is an external remedy. It penetrates
to the seat of the disease. It is simple, safe, and
sure.
WITHOUT A TRUMPET BLAST.
Simple merit rarely meets with its reward until
too late to be of value. The friendless patriot
who spends his life in the efforts to get members
ot the right politi al persuasion returned to Parlia-
ment has but small joy in the J.P. ship which
comes to him on y after he has sold out of the
butchering business, and left tiie township in which
he could have wilted up his enem.es from the
dizzy elevation of the Bench.
The plain daughter of the family—who has con-
traered a squint from the constant lontemplation
of that awful wart on her nose darns all the
family stockings, replaces the fugitive button,
regulates the supply o: hash, and washes the
annual and ever recurring baby, has s>-en all her
s sters in orange blossom, but missed her own
chances for the want of a trumpet blast. Yet, she
was admittedly the best of the Jot.
The same rule holds good throughout the whole
social fabric, w.th but few exceptions. One of
these, and the most noteworthy, is the Waterbury
Watch. It came and conquered absolutely on its
own merits. The cheap, lacquered, girucrack
Swiss watches have broken many an honest bush-
man’s heart, but were never known to keep time.
Their case is tin, their works are lead, and their
action as erratic as a C.M.G. on a road contract.
They go for either ten or fourteen hours a day,
according to teinperatnre, and scatter misery as
the Maxim gun scatters bullets. They are
shipped to the colour s as ballast; the dealers’
profit is the cause of their construction, and the
ciass stupidity of the purchaser the reason for
their existence. The mendacious.trumpet of the
advertiser bares forth their alleged excellence,
and the simple-minded man with the grass-seed
in his hair becomes a mark for the finger of scorn
and a target for his own contumely.
The Waterbury came like a dream of delight,
and in its own little raid and unobtrusive way
stole into tho hearts of Australians, and made its
name a household word; a synonym for all that
is exact, trustworthy, and beautiful.

It recently came out in the Commons that
on 12 of the chief English and Welsh lines,
and on the Caledonian and N.B. railway lines,
out of 55,278 railway servants employed just before
the strike, 33,179 worked for 12 hours daily ; that
22,592 drivers and firemen had to work for 15
hours daily in 69,825 instances, and for over lb
hours in 7341 instances. A resolution to the effect
that in the opinion of the Commons these exces-
sive hours were a scandal on justice, was opposed
by Government and beaten by 17 votes. Railway
Commissioner Eddy (N.S.W.) bails from the
Caledonian line.
Rev. Currie, a Melbourne parson, is now
fairly convinced that the earth is the Lord’s, and
syndicates ought to be spelt with an “i ” in the
first syllable. The unhappy shepherd borrowed
two sums of money from the defunct Premier
Building Society, on a vague spiritual understand-
ing with Jimmy Mirams that lie wouldn’t be
called upon to meet any instalments until Provi-
dence had returned him bounteous profit on his
little spec. Mirams, be says, gave him ttiis com-
forting assurance in the first instance, when he
took the shepherd’s borrowed coin for invest-
ment, and also repeated the glad tidings when
another £125 had to be put through, in the shep-
herd’s name, to meet a little bill due to Mr. John
Ebenezer Gourlay. Then Currie retired to tend
bis flock and wait for the blessed harvest-time.
Little by little he lost faith in Mirams, even in
Ebenezer had his trust become unstable, and when
the congregation sang “.All People who on Earth
do Dwell,” the poor man began to wish be hadn’t
bought any earth to dwell on. He doesn’t seem
to know where his particular chunk of this beauti-
ful world is situated, but he is down in a long
unhallowed list for £800 of instalments, which a
fleshly Court has ordered him to keep on paying
up for ever and ever, amen.
London Lord Mayor Savory's now cele-
brated sermon, which we see double-columned in
the Pall Mall with an old discourse of Spurgeon,
is undoubtedly a flagrant crib either from Spurgeon
or from the man from whom Spurgeon stole his
sermon. Apropos, it is related that a divinity-
student at Spurgeon's college was caught_ red-
handed in a discourse almost identical with a
former utterance by Mr. Spurgeon. The unfor-
tunate trespasser was challenged, and, in reply,
stoutly denied the charge ; chapter and verse were
then unearthed, yet still without eliciting a con-
fession. His fellow-students considered the case
sufficiently grave for a higher court, so the poor
fellow was “carpeted” before the “governor,” a
name of endearment enjoyed by Mr. Spurgeon.
Even then the student denied the insinuation, but
eventually owned to the soft impeachment of
having cribbed from an ancient divine. The boot
was then the other foot. The “governor ” himself
stood arraigned for the heinous crime of
plagiarism, and the matter ended amicably.

Joe Capp will figure no more amongst the
drivelling funniments of the London Sporting
Times. “The Pote,” “Jope,” “The Coroner,”
and Joe Capp—all those over-rated soakers have
soaked themselves away, and the twaddle they
used to talk to “ Master ” is now talked by some-
body else. “Master” will have to disappear one
of these days, and then the Pink ’Un, denuded of
its last stock joke, will slowly peter out.
At Bethnal-green, London, an inquest was
held, the other day, on an infant that had died at
the ago of one year, and a cold shudder went
through the assemblage when the mother arrived
and proved to be a'girl of 13. Yet, in some of the
manufacturing districts of the northern and mid-
land counties mothers of that age are tolerably
common. A very ordinary expedient in those
parts is to baptise two or more children in one
family by the same name, and then if the eldest
dies the next in order can be sent to work in the
factories at the age of 10 or 11, under cover of a
birth-certificate which gives her age as 13 or more.
Consequently, when the pious world is shocked to
hear of some precocious female who has committed
infanticide, or been jumped on with her husband’s
boots, at the age of 14, it is an even chance that
after all she is only 12 or thereabouts. The girl
of the city slums is a prematurely aged creature,
with an old, weary eye and an expression like a
tired Methusaleh ; and apart from the evidence of
her birth-certificate she might be a thing of yester-
day, or she might have been left over from the
Deluge.
Up to date, the British cable-fiend has
announced on no less than eighteen separate
occasions that “ the Argentine Government is
making strenuous efforts to put its finances on a
more satisfactory footing.” We would like this
monster to understand, once and for all, that Aus-
tralia does not care to the extent of one cockroach
what footing the Argentine finances are on. It
doesn’t care whether they are on one foot or
two, or on their last legs, or whether they are on
any footing whatever. If the Argentine Republic
has no finances at all it doesn’t matter, and if
there isn’t any Argentine this country
will get on just the same. The British speculator
is worried about Argentina because that country
has got a lot of his money, and he suffers from
an erroneous impression that Australia takes a
thrilling interest in his money, and can’t sleep till
he gets it back. On this point he is an ass. The
Australians appreciate a good, healthy revolution,
especially when a king has to take up his port-
manteau and quit; but when anyone keeps tele-
graphing about some miserable bad debts, this
nation rises to explain that it doesn’t care one
solitary howl even if the Government at Buenos
Ayres never pays a cent. The next daily paper
man who publishes the statement that Argentina
is making strenuous efforts to put its finances on
a more satisfactory footing, will perish miserably
in the midst of his sins, for the country is becoming
aggravated.

At Moss Vale School of Arts the other day
someone named Bugbear unsuccessfully tried to
have The Bulletin placed on the index expur-
gatorius. Bugbear denounced The Bulletin as
“a paper which went as near as it could to being
immoral.” Bugbear goes as near as he can to
being a liar.
Germany has refused to allow women to
enter the learned professions. Germany is now
the most powerful and, all round, the most
scientific nation in the world. The strongest
nation will always be the one in which the woman
rocks her own cradles instead of turning them
over to a hired woman who gives soothing-syrup
to the baby so that she, the slavey, may have time
to hug the butcher at the back-gate.
Dear Bulletin, —It is better to be a live
dog than a dead lion. Only three years ago an
old friend pointed out to me the evils of drink.
He had abstained for eight years and saved £500.
Last Christmas he owned freehold property to the
amount of £2000. Now he occupies 8ft. by 4ft.,
and was intestate, and knew of no nearer relative
than Japhet I am alive. Fill ’em up again,
Mrs. Forty-rod. N.B.—I have been engaged
writing temperance tracts, and don’t quite see
how to work this into one.— Hiram A biff.

THE LOSS OF THE SIX HUNDRED.
“Sweetness and Light ” Brigade,
Heed not the loss you’ve made,
Work, and you will bo paid
Back the six hundred ;
Yours not to ask us why
Polks, who prefer to die,
Don’t disinfectants buy—
Write off six hundred.
Odours to right of them,
Odours to left of them,
Odours in front of them
(Whereat we’ve wondered),
Suit Melbourne beau and belie,
Bred in the beastly smell.
Cheaply you charged and—well,
Dropped your six hundred.
At the prevailing mess—
Dirt, filth, and rottenness — :
Long has the heavy Press
Jollied and thundered ;
Meantime the Council winks,
Eats like a hog and drinks
“Long life to all the stinks !”
(We’ve smelt six hundred).
Sweetness and Light Brigade,
Yours is a wholesome trade ;
With cats and dogs decayed
Back streets are lumbered.
Germs fill each open drain,
Men, women, children slain
Weep in their graves, in va'n,
Eor that six hundred.
Though poison fills the air,
Keep heart and don’t despair—
Soon will some bloated mayor
Know he has blundered,
And whisper, ere he dies,
“ Dear pals, deodorise
Then, as your takings rise,
You’ll make six hundred.

“THE BULLETIN.”
(Published at Sydney, N.S.W.)
The Inique Weekly— Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newapaper.
“The Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dis
Undue Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
Payment of Members.
One Person, one Vote.
State Revenue derived directly from the Land.
Complete Secularisation of State Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
The Bulletin denounces—
Religious Interference in Politics.
Foreign Titles.
The Chinese.
Imperial Federation.
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started eleven years ago with no capital but brainsi
and has become a vast property, because it pos.
sesses a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
.The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress : it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of everv Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the New Zealand
Kanges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

Genuine Cures
are the only means by which the public can
distinguish honest men from frauds.
An unprecedented Success in New South Wales!
The subjoined Testimonial being the Seventh presenta-
tion to Dr. RAYMOND’S skill as an
Aurist and Expert Physician.
A WONDERFUL AND BONA-FIDE CURE
of a very difficult and complicated Chronic Deafness of
14 years duration. Had consulted the leading Aunsts of
Oollins-street, Melbourne.
An accomplished lady writes “To Dr.
RAYMOND, Aurist, &c. Dear Sir,—For 14
years I suffered from a severe and complicated
form of throat deafness, which rendered me almost
completely deaf in one ear and nearly so in the
other. I had consulted the leading aurists of
Melbourne, and without obtaining the slightest
relief, but since submitting myself to your treat-
ment there is a marked improvement in my hear-
ing, the left ear being quite cured, and instead of
hearing the watch ticking only at two inches from
the right ear, I can now hear it at a distance of
over three feet from this ear. I shall be happy at
any time to speak in favour of your simple but
efficacious treatment to anyone desiring a personal
interview, and I recommend all sufferers from
deafness to consult you without delay or while
their affliction is amenable to your treatment.
Yours truly, I. LOGAN, Commodore-street,
Newtown, Sydney, February 10, 1891.”
BOTH EARS ARE NOW COMPLETLY
CURED. AN ACHIEVEMENT
UNPARALLELED
in the History of Aural Therapeutics.
Since presenting the above testimonial Miss
Logan has had the hearing of both ears entirely
restored, and can now hear the watch ticking
with either ear at the normal distance of 60in.
This lady has kindly consented to personally
answer all inquiries respecting the cure. Her
address is Miss Logan, Commodore-street, xNew-
lUWU, _
It took three months to effect her cure, and Dr.
RAYMOND would just add here that the
allopathic and homoeopathic medicinal fraternity
may experiment till doomsday and “study in
Vienna, London, Paris, New York, or Woolloo-
mooloo for that matter, and then they will never
be able to do what he can do, simply because they
haven’t the experience, natural ability, or ma- ;
teria medica to enable them to compete with
brains and HERBS. ,
Sufferers from Deafness and all Diseases of the
Ear, Eye, &0., should send 6d. in stamps for Dr.
RAYMOND’S newly-published series of scien-
tific papers, and they will have the pleasure of
perusing the most magnificent and elaborately-
written dissertations on the diseases of the Ear
and Eye that ever appeared in the British Empire.
Enclosed in the supplementary series to tv
volume issued in 1887 will be seen irrefragable
testimony of the most remarkable cures that were
ever performed on this great island continent-
cures that some of the most noted physicians and
surgeons in England, Europe, and Australia
failed to perform ; besides other interesting matter
of vast importance to the human race.
NOTE.—Several Sydney testimonials from
patients who had tried to no avail the so-railed
Patent Ear Drums as advertised in these colonies,
and who had tested the “skill” of the Reading
allopathic doctors in Austral a, are published in
RAYMOND’S series of Scientific Papers for
1891.

Swimming a Fine Art.
A HEROIC EXAMPLE.
Of late there have been many instances wherein
a knowledge of the art of swimming has proved
of more than ordinary advantage to the fortunate
possessor. Oases, indeed, are daily occurring
wherein it has been manifest that but for such a
knowledge great loss of lue must have occurred,
while, unfortunately, as if to turther prove the
assertion, very many lives have been lost through
neglect in youth on the part of the unfon unates
to acquire the natatory art. Fortunately, the
youth of these colonies take to the water almost
from the time they can toddle, and there is but a
comparatively small minority of each sex amongst
the natives who cannot swim. One of the most
notable examples of modern times of the value of
this accomplishment was afforded in the case of
the ill-fated steamship Quetta, the circumstances
of whose wreck are fresh in the minds of many.
The matter at the time was, indeed, much com-
mented upon, and reference to the subject may be
pardoned at this period. Amongst the passengers
was a young girl, Miss May Lacy, the eldest
daughter of Mr. Tyson Lacy, of St. Helen’s
station, Mackay, who, in company with an uncle
and younger sister, were about to pay a visit to
the old country, and whose portrait appears in
this issue. As may be remembered, she was
amongst the survivors, thanks to the facility with
which she was able to keep afloat. But she
went through a remarkable experience, having
been no less than thirty-six hours in the water
without artificial support. The story of her adven-
tures may perhaps be best told in her own words.
After the melancholy event, and when safe again,
though still suffering from the effects of exposure,
she narrated her experiences to a clergyman on
board thus “ Shortly after nine p.m. I was
sitting in the saloon writing a letter to my mother
when suddenly a very remarkable noise was heard.
I at once rushed on deck and saw all the pas-
sengers in a great state of commotion. I rushed
downstairs again and dragged my sister out
of bed. She came on deck in a nightdress. I
then went to my uncle and said, * Is there any
danger V He said :‘ A little, but you both stick
by me.’ We then went
aft. It was like going
up hill, the ship " as
so high above the
water where we were
going. . • Miss
Nicklin was so kind
and offe r e d to go
do vn and get some
shawls to wrap my
sister in. When we
got aft the ship
suddenly went down.
I found mvself going
down, and when 1
was drinking in the
salt water I thought
I was going to be
drowned. But I came
up again, surrounded
by-Cingalese and
sheep. I felt myself
being pressed down
by them. It was
tar i le. Then I saw
a raft a short distance
out and swam to it
and was dragged on
to it by the purser,
who was very kind
to me. We were
attached to a bigger
raft crowded with
Cingalese. We got
away some distance,
as the Cingalese be-
came very noisy, and
we cut our raft adrift.
I remained on her
with the purser till
we were, as I thought,
two miles from shore,
and as he told me he
could not swim, I
left him and swam
for the shore. I did
not reach it, how-
ever. It was so far
away. I went on
swimming towards
the land, and saw
another raft, on
which were two
Cingalese, and to which I made my way and
got on it. But as they were very excited,
and I thought they might be drunk, I left it and
took to swimming again. It seemed so long. I
don’t remember anything till I saw the steamer
Albatross, which I took to be the Quetta. _ When
the boat came along I didn’t want to get into it,
as I thought it was going to take me to your
ship. I thought you were the steward when you
waved your hand to me on board when I was in
the water, but I knew you as well as Dr. Salter
when I came on board. I thought I had been
staying in a large hotel under the water. I think
I must have been unconscious from time to time.”
Altogether, Miss Laoy was in the water for a
period of over 30 hours, and no one but a most
proficient swimmer could possibly have had the
nerve, in such a trying time to husband her
strength by floating on her back, by which means
she kept on the surface. As she was quite naked
at the time she was rescued, the poor girl was
suffering terribly from the heat of the sun and
exposure, but, though in a precarious condition
for a time, she eventually recovered, and was
able to return to her distracted parents. The
moral to be drawn from this remarkable
story is obviously that it is the duty of every
person—both young and old, and of either sex —to
learn to swim at the earliest possible moment.
How many precious lives, indeed, would have been
preserved if swimming was but a universal ac-
complishment? And in this connection it may
be pertinent to ask whether it should not be made
compulsory in our schools, in the city at any rate,
that children should be taught the art? Baths
could be erected in connection with the school-
buildings at no very great cost, and probably
much more benefit would be derived from instruc-
tion therein than from much of the cramming
which is now the rule. However, in the mean-
time it behoves parents to compel their children,
where possible, to attend the public baths, and to
attend themselves also if they are unab’e to
swim. Amongst the many available spots in
Sydney none are more suitable or convenient than
the Sydney Bathing Companv at their * amons
Natat’orinm in Pitt-atreet. We have previously
referred in terms of commendation to this estab-
lishment, at which the accommodation is of a
very high order. The two large basins, which
are so constructed that no person could drown in
them, are fitted in a perfect manner, and from
their central position they are more easily reached
than any other baths, while the attention paid to
visitors is the subject of general remark. Tfye
hbllrs during which the baths aVe ripened to
the public are so arranged that an oppor-
tunity is afforded to both sexes to take ad-
vantage of the pleasures of sea bathing, while
at the weekly reunions of the dual club on
Wednesday evenings, both sexes can partake of
the healthy exercise together, under certain
restrictions as to membership, &c. Although the
extreme heat of the summer has_ now passed, the
baths are still as largely patronised as ever, due
mainly to the fact that the management have
made arrangements by which the temperature of
the water is raised to 72 deg. Bathing is there-
fore, made a luxury throughout the year at these
baths, and as pipes have been laid by means
of which, when the really cold weather comes on,
the temperature can be raised to 85 deg., there
will probably be even an increased attendance
during the winter. We would recommend all who
have not paid the Natatorium a visit to do so at
the earliest possible moment.
A Rising Locality.
THE POOR MAN’S OPPORTUNITY.
During the last five years the area of the metro-
polis of Sydney has extended to such an alarming
extent that one is constrained to pause sometimes
when passing through the suburbs and ask,
“ Where will it end ?” Go in what direction you
will miles away from the city—and there are
still streets and terraces of houses, all being
erected for the convenience of those now resident
and those still to come. On the western-suburb
line, the suburbs now extend almost continuously
to Parramatta, while south and east and north
houses meet the eye at every turn. It is an evi-
dence of population, of course, for houses will
not be erected unless they are likely to be
tenanted, and they cannot be erected without
money. Therefore, it is to be reasonably assumed
that the stream of population and wealth to the
city is on the increase. Each of these new build-
ings naturally adds to the value of the land in
the vicinity, and so it happens that what five
years ago was perhaps bush or sand, worth com-
paratively nothing, is now sold by the foot, and
yields to its fortunate possessors a wonderful
return on their outlay. In fact, it is beyond dis-
MISS MAY LACY
pute that many large fortunes have been made in
Svdney of late years by speculators who
have, with an eye to the future, purchased
when land was almost being given away, and
who have received the advantage of the
unearned increment of value. _ And, whatever
op nions we may hold upon this question of the
land, there can be no doubt we muT do in Rome
as the Romans do, and where possible in our own
way make money if we can. It is the spirit of
the times, and we must be in it or be left. Per-
haps no more favourable opportunity is presented
for speculation of this character at the present
time than on the north side of the harbour.
Already the population there is increasing very
rapidly, and it is spreading towards the new rail-
way line, in which direction it may fairly be
assumed the city will extend in the future. Indi-
cations are rife that a great part of the shipping
business of the port will gradually centre about the
North Shore, and when the railway is complete to
the shores of Port Jackson, a wonderful fillip
will be given to land values along the line.
Shrewd, hard-headed men, who observe this fact,
are purchasing along the line with a view to the
rise in values, and no spot is receiving greater
attention in this direction than Hornsby and its
vicinity. Much - peculation is going on there and
but little available land remains for the outside
public. An opportunity will, however, be afforded
on Saturday to those who are desirous of securing
the site for a residence in one of the most charm-
ing localities out of Sydney, or who wish
to buy with a view to future possibilities.
On that occasion Messrs. Thorpe and Co.,
of Parramatta, will sell on behalf of the
British Australian Land and Banking Co.
(of 161 Hoffnung’s Buildings, Sydney) a fine
property known as the Mount J ersey Estate,
which lies adjacent to the railway line, between
Hornsby and the Colah platform. This land is
splendidly situated on very high ground, being
the most elevated point in Hornsby, and when
the North Shore line is completed it will be within
the same distance of Sydney as Parramatta is in
another direction. The views to be obtained in
the vicinity are superb, while the soil has been
proved to he very fertile by the numerous
orchards which abound. In fact, no finer
orange trees or passion vines are to be seen
in the colony than at Hornsby, and as this will be
the junction of two lines—the North Shore and the
Great Northern- the district will be well served
by rail. In fact, there is every indication that in
the not very distant future Hornsby will be
settled with a larg'e and well-to-do population
when land obtained at the present time will in*
crease immensely in value. The Company
certainly offer their clients every inducement to
purchase. The deposit on one lot will be £B, in-
creasing by £1 per lot on each lot taken by one
bidder ; while instalments of 2s. a week only will
be required upon each lot. A considerable area
can thus be secured upon remarkably easy terms.
A special train will run to the Instate from -hed-
fern station on Saturday afternoon, for which
passes can be obtained on application, and there
should be extensive competition at this sale.
T<> Mr. John Pope, care of Harrison and
Co., 194 Castlereagh-street. Dear Sir,—lt is with
great pleasure that I contribute my testimony to
the efficacy of your “Silver CHit cure for piles.
I suffered severely and incessantly for seven (7)
years, and during that period I could not obtain
relief. Hearing of your specific I obtained and

SUICIDE OR NO SUICIDE.
The New York Life Insurance Company-
Pays Its Policy.
It being evident that most cases of self-destruc-
tion involve causes not under the victim s own
control, and that accident and murder may easily
o-ive rise to a suspicion of voluntary death, the
ss r ew York Life Insurance Company, in order to
prevent wrongs to the unfortunate, makes its
policies absolute security. It exercises caution in
granting a policy, and never issues one unless its
officers consider the applicant a good risk. But
when it has once issued its policy and taken the
premium, it feels bound to insure. It does not
insert in its policies the usual clause making them
void in case of “self-destruction, voluntarily or
involuntarily, sane or insane,'’ and claims no re-
lease from its contract except where there is
evidence of a purpose to defraud. In short, so
far as a life policy may properly be such, the hew
York Life’s policies are incontestable from the
moment the first premium is paid. The man with a
New York Life Insurance policy may feel sure that,
in case of his death, no delay, litigation or loss will
arise from the question of self-destruction
whether it be accidental or otherwise. If he has
been honestly insured, and honestly conforms to
the simple requirements of the contract, the pay-
ment of his policy is sure on proof of his death.

BEVERAGE
FOR
CHILDREN
Absolutely fure.
CADBURY’S COCOA is closely allied to
milk in the large proportion of flesh-forming and
strength-sustaining elements that it contains. It is pre-
pared on the principle of excluding the superabundance
of fatty indigestible matter with which Cocoa abounds
—supplying a refined thin infusion of absolutely pure
Cocoa, exhilarating and refreshing, for Breakfast, Lun-
cheon, Tea or Supper, giving staying power and im-
parting new life and vigour to growing children, and
those of delicate constitutions.
Tales of the Old Regime.
No. IV.—Convict Smith the Second.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
When Dr. Walsh, 'Catholic Bishop of
Nottingham, conveyed his episcopal congratula-
tions and blessings to that devoted priest, Robert
William Willson, on his consecration to the See of
Hobart Town, V.D.L., he remarked: “It seems
to me that I could make myself as happy in
accompanying you to Van Dieman’s Land as re-
maining in England. 1 would cheerfully obey an
order from Rome to that effect. The way to
Heaven is quite as short from Hobart Toivn as from
Nottingham. ”
The truth of the italicised passage is as it may
be, but Convict James Smith, per George 111.
(Second) was distinctly of opinion that the path
to hell from Hobart Town was much shorter than
from Nottingham. In Nottingham he was only
sentenced to be hanged. At Hobart Town they
the Law, Justice and the Authorities (who
occasionally took it into their heads to act with
the former parties) not merely threatened to dis-
locate Mr. Smith’s vertebras, but actually did so.
Now Convict Smith the Second’s notion of
distances was, let us tell you, not by any means to
be despised. .For according to all accounts (which
included his penal record) he was tolerably well-up
in that branch of the science of surveying, known
as road -ad m eas urem en t.
* # #
Had, however, he not been quite so pro-
ficient, the chances are that he would have re-
mained engaged in surveying roads in Notts
country instead of helping, for a short time, to
make them with pick, shovel and crow-bar (as a
preliminary to being hanged) in the neighbour-
hood of Glenorchy, suburb of Hobart Town in
Van Deinonia. _ Sometimes it happens that a
man’s strength is his weakness. This was the
explanation of Convict Smith the Second's trip to
the Southern World. He trusted too implicitly
to his capacity for estimating distances.
* # #
In the year ’B3, the County Surveyor
of Nottingham, ( one of whose apprentices
was Mr. James Smith, afterward James Smith
the Second, ex ship George HI., received
a commission from a London publisher. The
latter was engaged in bringing out a new edition
of that excellent and popular work, “The
Traveller’s Companion, or a Delineation of the
Turnpike Roads of England and Wales,” first
issued by Mr. John Cary, engraver and map-
printer, of the Strand, forty years before, and the
County Surveyor was required to revise all the
local information as to the main-roads, cross-
roads, and the gentlemen’s seats in Notts country.
The Surveyor being, of course, a big man, and
entitled to move in the best society—had not the
Lord-Lieutenant himself extended him one finger
at a county festival three years ago ?—did not
■ propose to do the work himself. " Not lie ; he
simply told Smith, an adolescent customer who
often got into scrapes just for a love of ingeniously
getting out of them, to spend a month on the job.
“ You pan lend me your gig, sir?” had queried
Apprentice—and soon-to-be transport—Smith.
“ No, indeed !” snapped in reply the big man.
How am I to get about if you’ve the gig and
mare 9 You must do it on Shanks’pony, James,
unless you can borrow a horse. Why, when I
was your age, I’d have walked the country twice
over, with pleasure, for the sake of the outing.”
Mr. Smith, barely out of his teens,
enjoyed an outing, no doubt, when there was a
fishing-line or a pretty girl to share it, but he
scarcely fancied a month’s pedestr an exercise
™ no other company than an old copy of
Cary,” a note-book and a pencil, and as his own
purse would not permit him to hire a horse for the
period of his survey, he made up his mind to beg
or borrow a steed whenever and wherever he
could.
By carrying out this resolve he was successful
in getting over much ground and through part of
his task before the moment came for him to
traverse the cross-road from Nottingham town
towards Matlock. He had ridden along the Great
Northern Road to the borders of Yorkshire, and
had scoured the eastern parts from Cringely-on-
i hll to where the old Roman way strikes at
Bingham the route over a point of Leicestersliire
to Grantham. lie had seen all the great
houses within the country limits and on
the borders from Welbeck to Bel voir Castle,
and, as he was not comple’ely emancipated
from trie By runic stage of manhood, had mooned
unmeloaiously in the precincts of Newstead
Abbey, and had spouted “ Don Juan ” and
Cluldo Harold ” to the wondering and un-
applausivo deer. Altogether ho had enjoyed
himself, for the season was a late-continuing
autumn, and though the warmth of summer days
had long vanished, something of their glow and
beauty still streamed through long aisles of
majestic oaks and into the mossy chapels which
Nature had carved in the trunks of great beeches.
When, .however, he came to describe the vicinity
of the road to Matlock there was a change. He
had so intruded ujion the kindness of such of his
friends as owned hacks that he felt he could not
trespass further upon their courtesy, and a re-
newed application for the loan of master’s gig
met with no more success than his first.
“Why, ’Lis only 14 miles to Somercote’s,” had
retorted, to his request, the County Surveyor.
You con'd get theie and back in a day and
walk it easily.”
‘'Not and do the gentry’s seats. There’s the
great house between Bobber’s Mill and Cinder
Hill, then there's the Sedley’s and Nuthall—the
park and armoury there’ll take a couple of days,
and there’s Mr. Rolleston’s by Watnal and
Greasley .Church. It’s not the straightforward
work I mind, but the going and coming. That’s
what wears me out.”
But the County Surveyor was adamant, and
Mr. James Smith had about concluded that he
would have to complete his work of survey solely
and purely by the aid of his own feet when a
thought struck him. Why should he not requisi-
tion from Gipsy Bill, the Ostler at the Blackmoor
Inn, the loan of one of the numerous riding-hacks
which wer- constantly being baited at that well-
known and highly-esteemed hostelry? Bill and
he were great Cronies—Bill had acted the artless
part to him of guide, philosopher, and friend in
the matter of those springes in Nuthall Stony;
Bill would surely do as much for hi n, especially
if his appeal were backed up by a shilling and a
deep draught of the Blackmoor’s nut-brown ale.
So Bill was applied to, and intimated, like the
then uninvented Barkis, “that he was willin’.”
If Mr. Smith would promise to start before day-
light on the morrow and to be back within 48
hours—well, there was young Mr. Blount’s pet
roadster, three-quarter blooded, in the stable,
and Mr. Blount would not return from the capital
for a couple of days at earliest, and—“p’r’aps
longer, Meester Jem, fur them young sirs hain’t
m none un hurry to a-coom bak w’en them’s
once in Lunnuh town.” Which remark was so
true that the _ soon-to-be-transported Smith
promptly recognised its truth and consummated
the bargain with a pot of beer and the shilling.
Mr. Blount’s three-fourths-blooded gelding
might have been fully-blooded, so rapidly did he
carry young Smith over his ground the next day.
Jim had never crossed his legs on such a bit of
horseflesh before. He knew something about the
noble animal in general, and he realised that it
would be a long day, once lie stabled this noble
animal at the Blackmoor, before he sat astride
another such a splendid creature as it was.
* # *
‘‘ Well, sir,” said Jim, relating his trouble
to Father Nellathorue in Hobart Town * a few
days before In's execution, twelve months later—
Jim was an Anglican, but he would have nothing
to do with Parson Ford—“the Devil was in that
horse. Believe me, sir, I had no thought of
stealing it.”
“ I believe you, Smith.”
1 hank you, sir. But Lord—oh, I beg your
pardon, Father, I wasn t thinking.”
“Nevermind, my man, go on. Keep to your
story - you haven’t much time.”
That s true, sir. But ’twas a horse of grand
fettle. I did the distance to Selstone in no time,
as I could take him ’cross fields and over hedges.
At Selstone, I could have stopped, but I went in
to Somercote’s, and from Somercote’s I must go
in to Matlock, jut for the pleasure of the ride, sir.
Why, I felt as though I’d never lived up to that
moment, Father!”
“ Yes, yes, I can understand. But go on,
Smith—time is so precious, my poor fellow.”
Priest Nellathorue could appreciate the feeling
which, even now, in his dire circumstances,
flushed the convict’s cheeks with the remembrance
of those few hours of genuine delight. Than
Father Nellathorne and Bishop Willson at a later
date, not even old Quorn Hall Clarke himself was
a better judge of, ora more fervent lover of, the
horse. Bishop Willson once saved a convict’s
neck because he could break-in a hitherto un-
tameable colt. There was, by the way, no des-
cription of vicious brute, from a Norfolk Island
Commandant and a Yandemonian Governor-
General to a lunatic and a bushranger, that the
Bishop did not tame.f
Smith continued : “Then the Devil being in
the gelding or in me—”
“In you !” interrupted the priest.
u “ P’ r ’ a ps,” said the ironed convict.
“ Satan’s come to many a man in the shape of a
horse. Then, when I got to Matlock, 2(i miles
from Nottingham—SO, p’r’aps, as I’d come—l
baited him at the Eagle and Child public-house,
and I had a snack myself. Chatting in the stable-
yard, I heard there was a meet of the hounds at
"See The Bulletin, March 21, 1891: “Convict Arden’s
Yellow-heart.”
f It may here be remarked that (he somewhat emphatic
distinction which has been, and maybe, drawn in these
“ Tales ” between the devotion and self-denying energy
displayed by priests and bishops of the Roman Catholic
faith and the qualities manifested by clergymen and
dignitaries of the Church of England, is not due to any
peculiar reverence possessed by the author for “Mother
Church.” In making the distinction, he is simply fol-
lowing the trend of historic fact.
Melton-Mowbray on the morrow, and although
Melton was full 20 miles the other side of Notting-
ham, I made up my mind I’d go there that night,
put up at a farm belonging to an aunt of mine
close by and see the meet next day. Well Jiat I
did. 1 left the Nottingham pike at Radford,
skirted the town so that I should not be seen,
and so reached the farm. I stopped there the
night—my aunt was so pleased to see me that she
never asked what I was doing in the neighbour-
hood or how I’d got there; and the next day I
went to the throw-off of the hounds, the gelding,
sir, being as fresh in the morning as though he
had not done 70 miles the previous day.” Here
the Condemned stopped to gather up his recol-
lections, and to feel once more, the thrill of
physical joy that had gladdened in the course of
that tatal ride.
Ah, sir, though it was my last free day, ’twas
a glorious one! I'm not sure,” and here he
brought his leer-irons together with a clank, “that
I wouldn’t go through what I’ve passed through
since to have such another day.”
“ Hush, my son ! Don't think of that, now.
Think of—of ”
“The hangman, Father! Well, sir, I will.
Oh, and by the way, sir, do you know who’ll do
the scragging on my day '! i hear Johnson’s at
Oatlands.”
“ Smith, I fear you do not yet understand or
realise your awful position. I consented to listen
to your story as j on asked me, but this irrelevancy
of thought is very terrible. Try, my man, and
fix your mind on your doom—and your God.”
And the devoted priest adopted a sternness of
tone which his own heart rebelled against as cruel,
though his reason approved of it as just. It was
intensely afflicting to a mind to whom this world
was the Shadow, the Unseen, the Substance to
witness, as the few such minds embraced in the
colonial population were almost weekly called
upon to witness, the indifference and frivolity of
condemned men* The awful subversion of the
moral-sense which it was the chief aim of the
Regime to effect was a process never completed
till till the creaking of the rope on the beam
told that again the System had once more
usurped the function of the Creator.
* * *
James Smith the Second went on with his
story—first apologising to the priest.
“ Well, I went to the meet. I intended to go
to see the throw-off and then go home. But with
the first cry of the beagles the gelding dashed
away, and over hedges and ditches and through
copse and spinney, and ’cross ploughed field and
fallow, I went with him. ’Twas a magnificent
run a regular rattler, and it lasted for ten miles.
I was not in at the death, no wonder, considering
what the nag had already done. I was, however,
close up, but the gelding lame at the finish.
They had killed near Strawston village. All at
once my situation flashed upon me. The gelding
would hold up, maybe, for another ten or twelve
miles, but I was thirty from home, going back
the w'ay I came. And then I made my mistake.
I got somehow to think the road by Grantham
was only twenty. It was an awful blunder, that.
Had I returned to my aunt’s, and told the story,
it might not have been too late to have got a
messenger to the Blackmoor. But, thinking it
was only twenty miles, I thought I’d chance it
with the horse through Grantham. Walking
and leading I thought to reach the inn before
daylight. But it was twenty-nine miles, and it

had been daylight for three hours before I
reached the inn. Near the Town Hall I was
arrested for stealing the horse.”
The transport paused in his story, as though he
expected an exclamation of surprise from the
priest. None came—Father Nellathornc was by
this time too well versed in the history of British
criminal practice to manifest wonderment at so
very probable an occurrence as the arrest of a
man for horse-stealing, just as he was about to
return the beast to its stable. He knew of worse
cases than that.
“Gipsy Bill, it appeared, had heard that I had
been seen on the road by Melton-Mowbray, and,
as I had told him I was going in the different
direction, had become fearful of my intentions,
He told the landlord—of course, putting a good
face on his own share in the transaction—and he,
in his turn, got alarmed at the prospect of olfendl
liig Mr. Blount, a first-class customer, and of
being held responsible for the horse. He waited
till within an hour of the arrival of the London
coach, by which he expected young Mr. Blount
back, and as I had not appeared, knocked up the
Chief Constable and a magistrate, and obtained
a warrant. You know the rest, Father, vdu know
the rest.”

The priest did know it. You, however,
reader, do not, and, therefore you must be told,
Very commonplace, very trifling, no doubt, was
the before-related incident, and yet, after all was
it not very human ? In these narratives of ola
colonial times, there is, we fear, much that is
Commonplace ana vulgar, but we cannot help

elothed he male transport and the checked print
Which clad the female, there, had, once upon a

Regime took good care hearts and emotions were
not tolerated in their System, They could feel
acutely for a prince or a peer who suffered from
toothache, and might, on rare occasions, wince in
sympathy when the hand of Death fell heavily on
a freeman’s home. But a convict’s aspirations ! -
a prisoner s emotions ! Tush ! Nonsense ! No

, We have ventured to differ from the men of the
Regime, and to follow the lead Of a judge like
1 orbes rather than Stephen, of Anglican clergy-
men like Naylor rather than Marsden, of Catholic
priests hke iherry and Nellathornc, McEnroe
and Willson rather than Governors hke Darling
Arthur and Denison, of officials like Crouch
rather than Price. And, treading thus in the
footsteps of our guides we have come to a point
whence wc can hear, stealing through the corridors
the wail^of 1 crash°oTshattered
lives. Something else, too, we hear-at longer
intervals, but still audible: the echo of a chant
as the angels note some sublime act of renunoia

registers and reports and minutes But a few
such there are all the same ; visible to him who

Why, this? Because the “rest,” so briefly
referred to by Convict James Smith the Second,
was a deed of that kind.
* * *
When the transport ship George 111.
obliged the Regime by foundering in D’Eutre-
castreaux Channel, among the convicts who
carried their opposition to Law and Order to such
an extent as to refuse to drown were Convicts
James Smith the Second and James Smith the
Fourth. James Smith (1) and James Smith (3)
were considerate enough to remain in the un-
fathomed depths of Ocean.
When the ship left “home” in addition to an
assortment of other but diversely pre-naraed
Smiths, she had on board four of the family who
answered to “James.” Which, though, by no
means unprecedented, was rather perplexing.
For instance, the First and Fourth James were
“ lifers,” while the Second and Third were only
short-termers-seven and ten years respectively,
“ Lifers ” had certain privileges (such as wearing
irons more frequently) which were not granted to
less fortunate short-term men. It would not have
been half so troublesome a matter had all four
been due for “life,” and, indeed, the Surgeon-
Superintendent seriously took counsel with him-
self as to whether he should not alter the manifest
so as to make their sentences uniform. He would
not, of course, have made ’em all short; he would
have extended ’em all to “life” fame* tbe

“ What’s your term, where were you tried, and

“ Seven years, sir, at Nottingham Lent Assizes,

The Comptroller was listening, and here said;
“Something wrong. Face him with the other
man. Doctor, what do you say ?”
Before the doctor could speak, the false No. 2
and the genuine No. 2 were brought face to
face. Once more that dreadful panorama flashed
before No. 4 s eyes—with an added horror now,
for he had given a false record—which meant new
penalties—and he sent a look so pleading, so
piteous towards the other that touched him even
in his own despair.
“ I really-oan’t say, sir !” replied the doctor to
the Comptroller s interrogation. * All I remem-

punishment would be dire and as swift as dire.
What lie didn’t know was the treatment it would
administer to recalcitrants, or to men suspected of
being former “ bolters.”
So when the Muster-Master next interrogated
him, he kept his mouth shut. And in the glow
of momentary pleasure which softened him as he
caught No. 4’s grateful glance he did not care
what might be the effect of the Comptroller’s em-
phatic order :“ Put him down as No. 4, Muster-
Master , lifer, suspected escapee. We’ll have to
see if we can’t find a way to open his lips and get

They got his record the same night. Or, rather,
they fitted him with one. There were a few
dozen James Smiths missing, and there was not
the least difficulty in identifying him with a

Convict James Smith, no longer Second, but

PRICE WARUNG.
The Toper's Confessional.
Ix many cookery-books it is taken for granted
that the stomach and brain to be experimented
upon belong to an individual in the most robust
health, who has never heard the chimes at inul-
niglit, been hurled out of a pub., nor ordered
devilled bones, heated to seventy times their
wonted heat, at daybreak. In this article, whilst
the farm labourer, the athlete, the steeplechase-
rider, the student, the burglar, and the teapot-
sucker will be instructed, the'interests of the
toteetaller—(kindly print as spelt)—will not be
neglected.
Happy the man who can respond to the matu-
t nal rat-tat at h s bedroom door with a cherry
“ Come in, William, and you needn’t put any hot
water in my bath this morning.” Thrice happy
he who can raise his head from his pillow of down
without qualms as to it (the head, I mean) rolling
from off his shoulders. Such knights of virtue
and integrity need no restorative nor eve-
opener, but can boldly attack that most
loathsome and terrible of all operations—the
morning’s toilet—with equanimity and without
adventitious ami. kbit some there be, I grieve
to say, who, having mislaid the key of the tantalus
over night, have perforce been compelled to lie
awake, tossing and groaning, enduring all the
tortures of the starving traveller in the arid
desert, until somebody -was stirring wdio could
procure th°m a morning draught.
Said draught takes in my and various forms.
1 ea is one of these, but 1 prefer hot-water, which
latter beverage is said by not a few experts to be
the finest pick-me-up oh ihe inhabited globe,
kluid magnesia is bur seldom used nowadays
with so many patent restoratives in the market!
With a choice between brandy-and-soda and
bitter beer, give me the latter —albeit, a gout pro-
vocative. Our ancestors, who knew a trick or
two in the drinking line, invariably cooled
their coppers on small ale, quaffed out of
richly-chased silver tankards. Some friends of
my youth will smile when they read that
I cannot commend brandy-and-soda as a useful
morning’s draught, though ’tis. doubtless, a pic-
turesque one in the extreme. The great fault of
this species of quencher is that it is so very
more-ish.” You always want another—and you
usually have one. Twopenn’orth more, and up
goes the vital force, only to fall down-derry-down
again within an hour or so. ’r he after-effects of
soda-water, it cannot be too widely known, are
depressing ; and this I say as a poor wretch who
lias strutted and fretted on Life’s stage for nearly
ha'f a century, and who during that tim Q has been
somewhat of a friend to the race of Bchweppe.
Hr and y by itself is better, and more s vtisfying ;
and Worcester sauce, with a dash of cayenne m
it, w,!l revive most corpses ; but the latter is apt
to breed a heart-burn like a blast furnace. Now,
listen, my bonnie boys ; the best awakeper and
general cheerer-np amongst chamber-drinks that
I know is a doctor. I don’t mean a thing of drm»s
and lancets, but the following blessed and soothing
concoction, which, if none of you have ever
sampled for eye-opening purposes, you should try
at once.
Put the yolk of a new-laid egg in a big tumbler.
Cover the mouth thereof with a piece of thick
paper—a writ or summons will do—and shake up,
This is a quicker operation than whacking into the
egg with a fork, and you don’t always break the
tumbler. Stir in a good wineglassful of the oldest
brandy you can get credit for, and then fill up to
the ‘ pretties ” with new milk. Add,a little sifted
sugar, mix well and gulp down. You can go
hunting,- or attend a meeting of creditors, in an
hour’s time, with safety, even if you happened
to retire to rest a few hours before, with your
hat on.
If the stomach is crying out for solid nourish-
ment, an anchovy toast is absolutely necessary.
But how few know the secret of concocting this
gentlemanly dish !
H ere you are.
Have ready a hot water plate, or if you haven’t
one, a slop-basin, filled with boiling water, with
an ordinary plate atop will do. On this melt a
piece of butter, the size of a walnut, and stir into
this the yoke of one egg. Then add two table-
spoonsful of anchovy sauce, add a dash of cayenne,
and stir well. Then get some thin slices of bread
toasted to a delicate brown, and hot. Well soak
in the mixture, and wolf. You will, probably
ask for more.
Never under any circumstances take a cold bath
the morning after a “heavy” night. It checks
the action of the heart, congests the liver,
paralyses the lungs, and will counteract all the
good effect which has been produced bv what you
have swallowed between the sheets. Hot-hot as
you can bear it, my children, if von have a bath
at all. Another way. Don’t have "a bath. What's
the matter with to-morrow morning, anyhow ?
Breakfast is a meal which, if possible, should
be eaten in solitary state. The brains of but
few people are in a condition to eon'rol conversa-
tion before noon. This, of course, does not apply
to milkmen, chimney-sweeps, and other worthies
who amass large fortunes through picking up the
early worm. The necessity for continual passing
to and fro of teacups, coffee-cups, and cocoa-cups,
all loaded to the brim, Occasionally adds a terror
to the breakfast-table, which makes the nervous
man to resolve in future to, break his fast within
the security of his own chamber. What a fearful
ordeal it is, in a large house, where you are a
visitor, to be the last down to breakfast—more
especially should your host err on the side of
punctuality, and dose his household with family
prayers each morning at nine to the tick ! I have
not infrequently gone through this ordeal.
“Good morning, Mr. dobbins,” observes the
lady of the house, with freezing politeness.
Afraid I m a little unpunctual,” I murmur.
“Not a bit of it, my dear boy,” shouts the host,
sarcastically— he always shouts at you, does your
host. “ You’re extremely punctual to your usual
time, half-an-hour after everybody eise.” And
then adds, witli the grin of a fiend -“I hope you’ll
be aide to shoot as straight as you made the spot
stroke last night.”
“ Looks a bit white about the gills, don’t he? ”
chuckles Dick Lawless, who has the digestion of a
plough boy and the nerves of a parachutist.
“ Yes,” replies the prettiest girl in the room
‘ I’m afraid you’re a sad rake, Mr. dubbins !” ’
And then I have to look at the superscription
on my letters, and ponroiß mv own tea-which I
u-'v-r drink, by the way, but furtively emptv into
the slop-basin, occasionally on the‘doth-whim
my host is deep in his paper.
Letters, by the same token, should invariably
be brought up to a man’s bedroom, and not placed
on his breakfast plate. It is always best to know
the worst as speedily as possible ; and you should
consistently hide your woes from your friends who
only laugh at them.
Equally objectionable is a face-to-face breakfast
with the wife of one’s bosom. Hardened repro-
bate that lam, my nerves are not always in the
best of order, as I descend , to the feast of eggs
and bacon and the flow of Qiiong Tart. Still the
issue must be faced with courage. So, with a
cheery word or to, I take my seat, pat the dogs,
who range themselves around my chair, and fall
to, in the hopes that my condition will pass
muster with the inspecting offleer.
Vain hope ! The steel grey eye of the sock-
darner is on me as I raise the cup of Van ITouten
to my lips, and a still stern voice rnurmers :
“ Good gracious, how your hand shakes this
morning ! ”
And I put down my cocoa untasted.
The game is up. I shall have to be in by ten
that evening*, and I might', as well be hanged for a
sheep as a lamb. So, with a sulky nod to the old
Dutch, I adjourn to the library where, over a
small bottle of beer, I grizzle over my woes, and
hunt up the law of divorce.-

A Lay of the Maori War.
The military hero of the following epic, which
has the merit of being true, is one of the delegates
at the Federal Convention :
The date of this ultra-political lay
Is ’6l, in the month of May,
Or it might have been April, I cannot say
To a year or a month or two or a day;
But ’twas in the time of Governor Grey—
That rare old time, when the Maori bold
Was whipping the cat for the land he’d sold,
A-swearing, ’twixt nips, a most terrible oath,
That the land wasn’t big enough for both
Maori and pakeha—one must go
To somewhere or other, above or below.
He knew the old proverb re quarrels just,
And the virtue of getting his “ blow in fust,”
So he sloshed around in the swampy bush
And bashed in the heads of the pakeha “ push,”
Till at length the white-man’s dander riz,
And, humping his rifle, he went to biz.
Lawyers and cobblers and knights of the shears,
Bank-clerks, doctors and auctioneers
Stepped into the ranks of the volunteers,
And the Regulars furnished the officiers
(Which is bastard French, for the sake of rhyme).
And fine and large they’d a rorty time.
They chivvied the Maoris from Otahuhu
And dispersed a portion to Waiuku,
But a troublesome section settled down
To play high-jinks round Wairoa town,
Or settlement, rather, and looted the farms,
Bagging the settlers’ fowls and arms,
And finally squatting some miles down lower
On the further bank of the river Wairoa.
Bimeby up came the sojers bold,
With their leaders gorgeous in red and gold.
They knew that somewhere among the trees
The niggers were hiding as thick as bees,
So they halted and opened out the prog,
And made a hole in the canteen grog,
While the Colonel chewed the matter o’er
As he smoked and drank and probably swore. -
As night came on he divided iiis force,
Giving commands in a whisper hoarse,
And when the dawn broke far from clear,
He had half his men in the Maoris’ rear;
Thus they were placed, as you will see,
Between Old Nick and the deep, blue sea.
Thus thought at least the Ensign gay
As he gave his orders to fire away,
Knowing the Colonel would do the same,
But the savages dropped to the little game.
Now, the Ensign’s name was Elephant Bill—
He had plenty of figure and lots of will,
But he wasn’t able to tell at all
The rattle of slugs from the whizz of a ball.
And when someone —a corporal—up and said
That the bullets, coming unpleasantly near,
Were undoubtedly regulation lead,
He said with a swear, a snarl, and a sneer,
“ Get back to your place and do as I say,
And blaze at the rascals over the way.”
But the Corporal had come from an editor’s chair,
Was used to being sworn at, and didn’t care ;
So he jumped to his feet and ran down the ranks,
Unheeding the Ensign’s bellowing blanks,
And yelled—“ Cease firing; don’t you see
As plain as ever a thing can be
That the men we are shooting aren’t niggers at all,
But our men ?” And just then the bugle-call
Rang out, and along the further bank
Appeared the soldiers file and rank
Near where the Maoris the night before
Had laid down to rest, but not to snore ;
And Elephant Bill swore a terrible D
And said : ‘ ‘ However can such things be—
To think that a pressman knows more than me
Then he drowned his bad grammar in ration rum
And wished the Maoris in Kingdom Come.
But the newspaper man, whose instinct keen
Had saved the force from what might-have-been,
Was feted and toasted and got his leave,
And went back to his sanctum more lies to weave.
So ends the story of Elephant Bill,
Who erred from want of the proper skill;
Who nearly sent, on that famous day,
A number of souls down the devious way
In the fighting times of Governor Grey.
That wealthy bachelor George Rolfe, the
Melbourne merchant, is about to federate with a
widow. The banns have already been proclaimed.
It will much amuse a lot of people to find
that Dean Mahony (late of Penrith N.S.W.) takes
a prominent part in the Irish movement to down
Parnell for his alleged giddeness.
A Melbourne man charged with stealing a
wheelbarrow pleaded hunger and no work. He
applied, he said, to the Salvation Army for food
but had been refused as he had never been in gaol.
To qualify him for the Army’s Charity the Bench
sent him up for a week to Col. Bull.
We have been reading with pleasure the
autobiography of Rev. J. Bickford, an Australian
parson free from cant, who does not hang upon
the skirts of wealth. The author records that his
gorge rose when in the charging sermon to himself
and other sucking parsons, leaving London for
Sydney, they were implored not to mix in politics;
but Bickford resolved he would, after seeing the
degraded state of the agricultural laborers in
Devon, his native county, wherefore he was known
throughout his Australian career as a staunch
Liberal.
A particularly heart - rending kind of
divorce-suit is disturbing the British aiistocracy.
Lady Russell demands to be put asunder because
her luvin’ ’usband takes revolvers to bed with
him, and when he can’t sleep he fills in the weary
hours by blazing away promiscuously all over the
bedroom. His favourite target, however, is the
footboard of the bed, and his wife is haunted
with a dreadful fear that some night he will shoot
her feet, and then say he did it by mistake. When
she remonstrates, however, he only laughs an
insane, cracked laugh, and begins shooting with
two revolvers at once, and as he is a ghastly shot
there is bound to be a disaster sooner or later.
And, in addition to that, the unfortunate lady is
unable to sleep —who could sleep with a British
peer whooping and doing gun practice at her little
pink extremities, and plunging and gambolling all
over the place with firearms in each hand and a
big, black cigar in his sinful jaw ? and she is
getting haggard and old-looking through anxiety ;
and as she doesn’t want to go home to her mother-
on crutches, or to return on her hands with her
feet coming behind her on wheels, she has resolved
to give the whole thing up.
How to Grow Rich. —Invest in land at Perth,
W.A. Plans from Intercolonial Investment Co.,
Limited, 9G Bathurst-street, Sydney.
Messrs. Lichtner and Co., Pitt-street,
Sydney, have at their offices a 3500-year-old sar-
cophagus of an Egyptian mummy. The wood of
which the coffin is composed is in a marvellous
state of preservation, and the colours in which the
drawings and inscriptions are executed are still of
wonderful brilliancy. The Bulletin recommends
that the sarcophagus be purchased for the funeral
of the next illustrious sculler—or the next prize-
fighter who is knocked into a mummy.
Plural-voting, or property-suffrage, is pro-
lific of sinister illustrations. Because of it Bung
has just been able to finesse more phenomenal
roll-stuffing in the Barkly division of the Colling-
wood electorate, Melbourne, which owns amongst
its properties a brewery. The Bung interest has
succeeded in sneaking upon the Barkly electoral
roll the names of 95 non-residents who happen to he
shareholders in that brewery, and the Victorian
Government seems dubious as to any ready way
of disqualifying these intruders. A blue pencil
and a determined fist weroall that Acting-Premier
Langridge need have insisted on. But the root of
the evil will never be destroyed until “ One man
one vote ” is the universal law of this country.
So long as plural voting is our immoral law, so
long a brewery shareholder will be as immorally
justified in pluralising his vote as any other un-
duly privileged property-owner. Bank share-
holders, club members, and all far-distant part-
ners in the loosest kinds of proprietaries are
legally but immorally on the same footing, if they
choose to work the oracle, as is the man who has
two houses in two different electorates. Attack
the head of the octopus and destroy the devil-fish
in one act. Abolish all plural voting, and give to
every man one vote to be compulsorily polled
every time it is needed for State purposes.

SWORN CERTIFICATE. —One of Thousands more.
Noble-street, Newton, Geelong,
10th December, 1888.
To H. P. Kugelmann, Esq.
Dear Sir,—This is to certify that I. Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. I consulted
more than one doctor, and during that time took a great
quantity of medicine without it doing me the slightest
good, but I became worse every day, wasting away until
1 became a perfect skeleton. About February last I began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I
was expectoratingeverv day, I became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. 1 agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. At the
end of three months I was taken bad one morning, and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that lime I commenced to improve, and
was gaining in weight every day. Aliout a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, 1 am as well as ever.
P. KEENAN.
