THE RED PAGE
The Hampdenshire Wonder —J. D. Beres-
ford (Dymock’s). An unusual subject,
worked out with great skill. “Ginger”
Stott was the demon bowler of his time,
and his son was predestined to be
something more wonderful. He is;
but not in his father’s line. The kid
absorbs knowledge at the pores, and
his gaze seems to hold the wisdom of
the ages. His powers are beyond the
limit-—swallowing the whole Encyclo-
paedia Britannica in three weeks, for in-
stance—but the freak holds the reader
as he did the neighbors.
The Notorious Miss Lisle —Mrs. Baillie Rey-
nolds (Svdney Book Club). The marriage
of Miss Lisle is neatly brought about be-
fore the husband learns why she had
been notorious. The characters are
effectively tangled in the subseouent
misunderstandings, and then landed
safely at “finis.” The book is clever,
and bound to be popular, though it will
not place the author, as the publishers
claim, “in the very front rank of
present-day novelists.” The wonderful
Marie C. and the tireless Nat G. are
still ranks ahead.
The Voice of the Forest —Joseph Burtt
(Dymock’s). A powerful story of the
Congo, and the horrors 'of which Morel
gave some idea in Red Rubber. One
of the characters recites a poem, in
which West Africa is described as a
wanton woman, enticing men to her
and then killing them. Any Wild that
Calls is that kind of female.
Love under Fire —Randall Parrish (Geo.
Robertson and Co.). A Civil War
story, on very similar lines to the au-
thor’s first success —My Lady of the
South. The glittering picture-wrapper
matches the contents.
Australian Verse
Hugh McCrae’s Satyrs and Sunlight was
first published with illustrations by Norman
Lindsay in an edition of 100 copies at 21s.
each. Reviewers gave it high praise, and
many people regretted that they had not
subscribed. • The persistent demand for
copies which sent the price up to five
guineas was attributable to the excellent
plates, as well as the poems, and it is a good
thing that the poet should have a chance of
appealing to the largest audience possible on
his own merits. The poet now has his
chance, as a new Satyrs and Sunlight, with-
out illustrations, has been “printed in Eng-
land,” for T. C. Lothian, and is sold at
3s. 6d. net. It will be interesting to see
whether this edition is a success, for the
book contains as much pure poetry as has
been produced by one man in Australia, and
it has no obvious local color Whatever.
McCrae’s work is tingling with life; but it
is the utterly free, riotous life of a re-
created bygone world, and it supplies plenty
of evidence in support of his fine lines called
“Inspiration”:—
The singing men of long ago
Still sing; and through the mould
That stops their chapless mouths below.
We hear their songs of old.
There are a few alterations in the new
edition of Satyrs and Sunlight, two or three
weak items in the .earlier edition having been
dropped and replaced by better new verses.
Considering the price, the format is as good
as could be expected. It ought to be pos-
sible to print equally as well in Australia
and sell the book profitably at 3s. 6d. net ;
but, apparently, it is not. The publication of
poetry is a venturesome business, and T. C.
Lothian deserves praise for his enterprise.
In this case, the book is assured of a wel-
come from all poetry lovers in Australia.
A hundred miles on either side lies gray,
forbidding sand;
A single maid to sanctify a vast and lonely
land.
Her father keeps the Half-way Bore. The
desert is the urn
That holds the ashes of his hopes. Strong-
willed and taciturn.
Full jealously he fondles her (ah, often has
she smiled;
For she, a woman rosy ripe, to him is yet
a child).
And foolish as a father is. how can he be
aware
That all her longings grope for. that which
is a woman’s share?
She feels the hurt of Emptiness—and will
till Time has stilled
The voices of her heritage and cravings un-
fulfilled.
She feels the pang, and knows it is the
wanton ache of Life—
Perpetuation’s muffled voice, that stabs her
like a knife—
Hers is the Love Unsatisfied that is her
pride and shame
(She pictured him by shade and sheen...
but only Abdul came!)
And there is a striking idea, neatly ex-
pressed in “The Pilgrimage”:—
Out where the “willy-willy” churns
To dust the desert sand;
Out where the sun with hell-rays burns
And tortures all the land;
Out where the sand and silence mate.
Can one amongst ye gauge
The reason and the ultimate
Of Abdul’s pilgrimage?
And are his lonely dreams as brown
As dreams of ours are white?
Does Fond Eyes in an Afghan town
Gaze down the star-hung night?
And where the blood-red sun has set
In purples and in pinks.
Behold...a turban’d silhouette:
The shadow of the Sphynx?
Still there is no warranty for the editor’s
assumption that “his sonnets will rank with
the great classics of the English language.”
From the memoir, it seems that the brief
life of Gay was more unfortunate than had
been supposed. “Caledonia, stern and wild,”
was not a good nurse for a sickly poetic
child; London had no room for him; and
when he reached Australia his disease had
gone too far for permanent cure. His
struggle in Victoria is already known. Fol-
lows a passage from his own account of a
lodging-house in Queer-street, London:—
“The lodgers in the next room were an
artist and his wife, both claiming good •
birth and both drunkards. The man painted
fancy pictures, in water-colors very daintily,
and then pawned them for a few shillings,
which he and his wife drank, progressing
fi'om public-house to public-house, and or-
dering whisky and gin respectively. They
had frequent violent quarrels, and I have
never heard a woman so violent in abuse...
After one of their usual bouts, the artist
had not a penny left, even to buy card-
board for a new picture. He appealed to
me for a loan, which I could not furnish,
being myself penniless. Then he suggested
that, as I had a good coat, while his was
old and green, I should lend it to him to
pawn. He could redeem it, he said, in the
evening. I consented. The coat was
pawned, the material bought, the picture
painted and disposed of, and my coat re-
deemed before evening. Occasionally, on
Sundays, they invited me to share their
dinner, and, in spite of their very obvious
failings, I thought them on the whole not
bad-hearted people, till the day I was leav-
ing for home, when they presented me with
a bill for the little dinners....l was thun-
derstruck, but could not both pay and go
home. Well, that was a nice bag I had •
they would accept that. There was little
in it. What there was I disposed of. and
left the bav. glad now to be off at any cost
R. J. Cassidy, known as “Gilrooney” to
readers of The Bulletin and other papers,
makes his first appearance in book form
from the house of Lothian. The Land of the
Starry Cross and other Verses pulses with a
different kind of life to that of Satyrs and
Sunlight. The joys and sorrows of bush-
men, the boon companions and good-drinking
days of their youth, the girls with whom
they trifled, or to whom they were true, are
represented here, and their land is this sub-
stantial continent, 7 whose poets think they
have a mortgage on the starry cross. “Gil-
rooney” loves the lanf and its people, and
proudly declares his honorable lineage :
I come of the common people—the people
who dared to roam
The shuddering wild seas over, while your
weaklings stayed at home —
The people who dared to wander, to work
and dream and hope.
In a land that gave them freedom, and their
wildest fancies scope.
The vigor and the manliness of the author,
and a certain amount of swifig in his lines,
carry him a good way as a balladist; but he
has not the fire, nor the technical quality
necessary to place him in the front rank.
The weakness of many verses is due to their
dealing with the class rather than the indi-
vidual, with generalities instead of particu-
lar instances, for it takes a poet of high
voltage to illumine a big space. There is
strong and distinctive work in the group of
“Sunset Silhouettes”; in fact, these verses
of exiles and sandscapes, of Abdul and his
“camuel,” are alone worth the book’s price.
The tragedy of a solitary white girl in the
desert could hardly be more forcibly ex-
pressed than it is in “The Desert’s Daugh-
ter.”
A third volume, from T. C. Lothian at the
same price as the others, is The Complete
Poetical Works of William Gay. The con-
tents of three out-of-print booklets and a
memoir by J. Glen Oliphant, make an in-
teresting memento of a small calibre immi-
grant poet. The best work of Gay is in his
sonnets, and the writer has a special liking
for this one : -
To M., with some Verses.
If in the summer of thy bright regard
For one brief season these poor rhymes
shall live.
I ask no more, nor think my fate too hard
If other eyes but wintry looks should
give;
Nor will I grieve though what I here have
writ
O’erburdened Time should drop among
the ways.
And to the unremembering dust commit.
Beyond the praise and blame of other
days :
The song doth pass, but I who sing, remain.
I pluck from Death’s own heart a life
more deep,
And as the Spring, that dies not, in her
train
Doth scatter blossoms for the winds to
reap,
So I, immortal, as I fare along
Will strew my‘path with mortal flowers of
song.
The success of The Closed Door, of Doro-
thea Mackellar, brought showers of manu-
script upon the head of the publisher, H. H.
Champion, of Melbourne, and he is gal-
lantly trying his luck again with two other
young ladies—Ruth Bedford and Ella
McFadyen. One,? cannot expect a handful
of opals for a shilling every time; but there
is some color and music in Miss Bedford’s
Sydney at Sunset, and other Verses. The
local reader is arrested by the opening lines:
Nightly the gradual pageant is unroll’d
Before my wondering eyes,
The pure vermilion, the rose and gold
And pearl of sunset skies.
Here, from my window, through these
magic hours
I gaze across the bay
. Where Sydney lifts to Heaven all her
towers.
Dark at the death of day.
And, next, there is a fervent invocation to
“Keep me away from Love,” for reasons less
apparent than those of “Fiona Macleod’s”
passionate “Prayer of Women.” “Fiona”
was a man, and the real girl who begs to
be kept away from love would be jolly an-
noyed if taken at her word.... The re-
maining verses are of average quality, and
all are worth a place in covers.
Australian Fiction
The Bathers, by W. G. Henderson (Book-
stall Co., Is.), is a readable yarn of a par-
son who was rescued from the surf by a
superior chorus girl, who also saved him
from Wowserism and other foolishness. The
scenes in Sydney— at the theatre and in the
boardinghouse—are attractive; but one is
hardly prepared for the parson in the bush
as a champion roughrider, saying “damn”
with great feeling, and jumping so well at
.the Show that he won £5OO for the hospital,
also the heart-felt approbation of a bushie:
“My oath, that’s the sort of bloke whose
preachin’ I’d listen to.” That sort of
bloke doesn’t preach. Henderson’s book of
short stories— Midnight's Daughter, and the
novel, Norah Conough, which followed it,
were praised on this Page when they ap-
peared, and gave hopes of some sterling
work from his pen. He ought to do better
than The Bathers.
Steele Rudd has got back to familiar
ground in The Book of Dan (Bookstall Co.,
Is.), and is a good deal more comfortable
there than he was in town with The Dash-
woods. The fact that Dan is a member of
the original Selection family entitles him to
consideration ; but he makes such a farcical
nuisance of himself that he loses reality.
And what does Steele Rudd mean by this —
Ted found Dan lying on the broad of his
back in the doorway. His large, bare feet,
like the front ends of a couple of large
gohannas, playing hide and seek among the
ironbarks, were sprawling up along either
door-post
When A Little Bush Maid appeared,
Mary Grant Bruce was welcomed as a
valuable addition to the ranks of those who
provide Australian fiction for young people.
Her second book, Mates at Billahongi Angus
and Robertson), is an improvement, it is a
story which the grown-up can read with in-
terest before giving it to a girl or boy with
reasonable certainty of appreciation.
* * * *
Two of Louis Becke’s long yarns— Tom,
Wallis and Helen Adair, and a collection of
short stories, called Rodman the Boat
Steerer, have been published in paper covers
at 6d. each. A selection of his South Sea
stories, in one volume, should be a paying
proposition. Most of the early volumes are
out of print, or unobtainable here.
C. Ross-Johnson, who died at an early
age in Sydney last week, was a capable
journalist and a promising novelist. His
only published book, The Trader , is a good
story of adventure in New Guinea, w r here
he had lived for some time.
Owen Wister
The death of Owen Wister, reported by
cable, is a loss to American literature.. He
was of Quaker parentage, a Harvard gradu-
ate and LL.D. of Pennsylvania University,
and he became one of the best interpreters
of what was left of the rough primitive
life of the Western States. The Virginian
stands out as the cow-boy yarn. The earlier
Lin McLean is a novel with a plot, told
in a series of short stories—an unusual form
which did not succeed. The atmosphere
and humor of The Virginian were reproduced
in the short stories of Members of the
Family, published a few months ago. Wis-
ter said that “of all living authors Henry
James has influenced me' most. His art
makes other fiction look only half grown
up.” Lady Baltimore showed the James
influence markedly; but then it is a story
based on old-time town-life in South Caro-
olina, and has nothing to do with cowboys.
Wister’s other books appear to be unknown
in Australia. It is said that he wrote good
memoirs of General Grant and Washington.
“S.T.S.” : Warwick Deeping puts an Aus-
tralian heroine into The Return of the Petti-
coat. As a detail, she wanted to have her
breasts amputated, so that she could mas-
querade as a man ; but no surgeon would do
it, and she was slim enough to manage with-
out. But that is by the way. Deeping care-
fully avoids committing himself on Austra-
lian matters. But just once the heroine,
being asked what line she is leaving London
by, replies, “The Orient Royal Mail” ; and
at once it becomes evident that the author
has got his information from an advertise-
ment. The double-barrelled name never
came into general use in this country.
Art and Horses
"F.J.8.”: The Sydney Horning Herald ,
writing of Adam Lindsay (Jordon, pronounces
as a ileaven-iiispirul obiter dictum: —
"No doubt Gordon’s claim to the
title of a national poet is generally
based on his love of the horse. Perhaps
a greater degree of emphasis should be
laid on the treatment than on the sub-
ject. With a single exception Gordon
is the only writer of Australian verse
who, when he writes of horses, does not
betray himself a townsman. The
painters have done much better. Lam-
bert and Mahony, and the late Douglas
Pry were unmistakably experts. The
poets may write carefully and sincerely
on other topics, but when they come to a
horse race or cattle muster, there begins
that awful unmistakable jingle that
justifies any reader in throwing his book
across the room.”
Who is the "single exception” referred to?
Does the Herald mean "Banjo” Paterson
or Will H. Ogilvie? Of course the ill-fated
"Breaker” (Harry Morant) would hardly
enter into the Herald’s mind; but he knew
the horse with the most \vonderfully inti-
mate knowledge.
Por my own part, I do not consider that
Lambert ever painted what the unsophisti-
cated are apt to describe as "a real, live
horse.” When introduced as an accessory
to portraiture, his horse suggests a stuffed
model. His big oil, “Across the Black Soil
Plains,” belongs, of course, to another cate-
gory, It is artistic melodrama, sensational,
bold—making a huge bid for popular ap-
plause. Mahony is quite a different proposi-
tion. Mahony did not love his own kind, and
took precious little trouble to understand his
fellow-man. He took refuge from purely
imaginary trials and tribulations in the
cultivation of close friendships with horses
and dogs—particularly horses. He did not
draw and paint merely horses —he demon-
strated the psychology of every individual
horse who "sat” for him. Every one of
Prank Mahony’s counterfeit presentments
of equine models possesses a personality.
Harry Garlicky cut off in his promising
youth, had a similar intimate acquaintance
with many a friendly farm-drudge—ill-fed,
overworked, patient, pathetic mokes. Doug-
las Pry’s horses are all aristocrats —at-
tempts at the realisation of enamelled
dreams, by a visionary living in a practical
age of auto-cars. Douglas Fry is deadj hence
H de mortuis nil nisi verum” (never mind the
“bonum”). Well, according to a Bulletin
contribute somebody said to the recently-
dead deifier of drawing-room hippos, “Isn’t
it a curious thing that you, who paint Eng-
lish horses, come to Australia, while Frank
Mahony, who paints Australian horses, goes
to England?” “Yes,” Fry is reported to
have said. “But Mahony is on the wrong
tack. He paints horses as they are.” “And
you?” "Oh, I paint horses as they ought
to he.” Artist Lionel Lindsay, in paying a
tribute to Douglas Pry, said things which,
in Swift’s Houyhnhnm vocabulary, “are
not!” He stated, quite erroneously, that
Pry was better equipped than Mahony in
the matter of technique, and that he had
a greater knowledge of anatomy. As a
close friend of Mahony for many years, i
know full well what that sterling artist
wrought and endured to obtain his know-
ledge. He practically haunted the Zoo and
the training-ground at Randwick. Four
o’clock in the morning would find him
sketching at the Glebe Island abattoirs.
His studio reeked of decaying and putrid
flesh- —of a horse’s head from “General”
Powell, Curator of the Zoo; or of a bul-
lock’s, from Glebe Island : —nailed to the
•wall, and faithfully studied till it fell to
pieces. [There’s realism for you!]
Here is a picture of an authentic Aus-
tralian ruin, which might pass for a frag-
ment of Tintern Abbey or other medieval
stone remains. It represents the doorway
of the barracks at Vaucluse House, where
the assigned servants were lodged in the days
of Sir 11. Brown Hayes and W. C. Went-
worth, who owned the place. The print
is a reproduction, much reduced, of one of
Sid G. Smith’s fine pen-drawings for Old
Sydney, which is to be published shortly by
Angus and Robertson, in a limited edition,
at 21s. The descriptive matter is supplied
by C. 11. Bertie, of the Sydney Municipal
Library, a capable grubber amongst dusty
records.

What
About
That
Dandruff?
jjT.
ts>.
There is just this much about it:
Dandruff is a germ disease, is
most untidy, annoying, and leads
to baldness. When chronic, it
is very stubborn, but surely
yields to thorough and energetic
treatment. All germs must be
destroyed, the scalp must be
restored to health. Here is the
remedy: Ayer’s Hair Vigor.
Ask your doctor about using it.

fact, many thin women possess very pretty, sweet taces, but
this is usually admitted with the qualifying phrase*, * but,

bosom. With these, thin arms and hollow cheeks are a rarity.
Thousands of women suffering the ravages of ill-health have

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Shadows.
What shades we are: what shadows we pursue—
We know not what They are, nor what We do —
Homer has said it, and you must admit
The Master-Poet knew a thing or two!
And wise old Omar says we are “a row
Of Magic Shadow-shapes that come and go,
Round with the Sun-illumined Lantern, held
In midnight by the Master of the Show.”
The Show ! Aha ! the simile is pat,
Complete, and ne plus ultra, and all that —
So beautifully modern, after all,
Though coined ere Noah fouled Mount Ararat!
For, just consider, in a casual way
The while you watch your fellow-Shades at play,
With what determination and delight
They chase the shadow Picture Show to-day!
Ignore the millions spent on halls and screens —
The billion-footed films of the machines —
The operating armies, and their pay,
And ask what it portends, and what it means.
Is it a craze, that runs from Pole to Pole?
Has it an end, an object, or a goal?
It seems indifferent to Time and Space,
Forthshadowing the Cosmos as a Whole!
Heaven, and Hell, and all the worlds between,
With glory, gioom, and color deck the screen:
Impalpable—impossible they glow,
Tremble, and —pass as tliey had never been!
The earth, the air, the ocean and the flame
Are stripped of all their wonders, without shame —
Yea! semblance of the Ancient Mystery
Is flung for Shades that cannot give It name!
! ask, as Daley asked you, years ago:
Which'of us shall distinguish Shade from Show?
Perchance we Shades are nightly witnessing
'the making of new worlds, for all we know!
It is a maddening thought, but we can see
Existence is a matter of Degree:
The insubstantial mockeries we limn
From film and beam may actually Be !
The shadow Sinner and the shadow Saint
That weird Machines for our amusement paint,
May in the Fourth Dimension find new scope—
Oh, someone kindly pinch me, ere I faint!
I think, somehow, we stand upon the fringe
Of The Impossible: our lives impinge
Upon the Couldn’t-Be: . . . Now, God forbid! .. .
Ah ! . . . That is why we pray, and why we cringe!
What Shades we are—what Shadows we pursue!
Men nightly pass Creations in review,
And pay their shillings just to see a Show —
A play of Shadows, like to Me and You!

Circe.
The dappled fawn-skin, drooping,
Leaves one white bosom bare,
Still flushed, where drunken kisses
Have left their token there.
Like some wild rose, whose petals-
A satyr’s hand dishevels, .
She reigns amid the revels,
With vine-leaves in her hair.
The wreathed, white lilies sicken,
The low, sweet lamp-flame dies.
Yet shriller grows the laughter.
Fierce fire in cheeks and eyes
Grows fiercer still, and bolder —
Hot lips to breast and shoulder —
She sees the night grow older,
She sees the wild-beast rise.
Bright eyes beneath their lashes,
Red, laughing mouth a-stain,
She tosses high the goblet
And calls her guests to drain
The wine-cup’s ruby treasure.
(Oh sad heart-beats, that measure
For them the wine of pleasure,
For thee, the lees of pain!)

THE PHANTOM OF THIN PLATES AND FAT DIVIDENDS.
(1) Lhyps trading on the A .S.W. coast are inspected every 12 months. (2) A sworn statement made before a Royal Commission was to the effect that
under certain circumstances, vessels working bar harbors might wear their plates to the extent of one-eighth of an inch in six months. (3)Some vessels
employed m the coastal trade are said to have plates three-sixteenths of an inch thick. — Three Startling Facts.
[For Tiik Bulletin.]
Beyond the silent headlands, by islet, rock and cape,
In flying scud and cloud drift they see that dreadful shape;
It rides upon the tempest, it sits “the bucking gale,
A horror drawn in darkness-against the morning pale.
V\ orse than the wrath that thundered above Ulysses’ crew,
More than the flaming whiskers Thor’s awful visage grew,
Sterner than Jove’s red lightning that split the ebon sky,
That ponderous doom that follows the ships that go to die.
Bell-toppered through the darkness, large-waisted through the storm,
Rolls o er the black sea’s anger that round, enormous form;
At rest on cloudy cushions, where late the sea Pates sat,
The shipmen see with anguish the awful shape of Pat.
By rock, and cape, and islet the, winds his wreckage spread,
His flabby hand with corpses the sickened deep has fed;
Insured/gainst wrath and tempest, what should he reek of sin,
Who makes black death his partner to rake his shekels in?
The thin steel from his forges grinds on the river bar,
The worn plates meet the surges in endless sweep and jar,
The cheap decks reel and shudder above the wide sea grave,
With racing engines chanting Fat’s mercy on the wave.
The loud seas shriek in triumph, the broken rivets start,
ith groan of rending metal the wide seams gape apart;
Death laughs—the black night closes—another vessel gone—
The nine days 5 wonder passes—Fat and his sea roll on.
Beyond the lighted headland, in calm and shouting storm,

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to Tiie Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking
some care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with rego.rd to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a gdod thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. /.‘The Jlditor, The Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for ‘‘copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

RUMORS OF DROUGHT.
In these days the ominous and almost for-
gotten word “Drought” begins to appear
here and there in the papers. Not since
1903 has the obnoxious expression been so
frequent. Dry spots are developing where a
short-memoried community had almost for-
gotten that spots ever were dry, and a sort
of weird expectancy is in the air. The pre-
sent feeling of unrest may pass off, but the
fact remains that the good old drought is as.
.certain to recur as the sunrise, and that it
looks almost due. It is one of Australia’s
reliable visitors—a visitor for whose coming
It is only reasonable to make provision. And,
indirectly, some little provision has been
made; for instance, a considerable amount
.of foreign capital has been wisely driven out
■of the country, and a considerable mass of
what used to be English-owned securities
.are now Australian-owned. But it is diffi-
cult to say that anything has been done of
sei purpose to meet the inevitable trouble.
Australia is, above all other white-man’s
countries, the one which should take thought
for the morrow, and it takes very little
thought. It should increase its taxes, and
reduce its debts, and build its public works
out of revenue in good years, so that it may
reduce its taxes, and. if necessary, borrow a
little in years of leanness and profound
thirst. Unfortunately, it reverses the pro-
cess. It borrows most when it least re-
quires to, because it is then easy to get the
money; and it piles up taxes when its people
are least able to stand them, because it has
“blewed” all its credit. when it didn’t re-
quire credit. When it feels well and doesn’t
need artificial support, it gets financially
drunk, and when it feels ill, and would be
the better of fermented or spirituous sus-
tenance, it too often hasn’t the price of a
pint about its clothes, because it has had too
many pints already.
The announcement that the value of
N.S.W.’s agricultural production—N.S.W.
being the State which has got its figures
for 1911 out first —is on the down grade
this year may, or may not, be a hint of
trouble to come. There have been violent
fluctuations before, but when a serious drop
in values happens along, just as the old
lamentations about the lack of rain begin to
recur, it isn’t a pleasant subject. Agricul-
ture is a rather painful subject at all times
in the State which is muddled alternately by
Gregory Wade and James McGowen. The
total output of the N.S.W. bucolic industry
last year was worth £9,489,060, and it took;,
so far as can be ascertained, over 90,000
people to produce that value. The total
value of manufactures was £17,015,000, and
it took about 99,000 people to produce that
result. The value of the agricultural indqs-
try is arrived at by taking the price of the
gross output, without deduction for raw
material in the wav of seed or manures;
while that of manufactures is estimated by
taking the value of the output less all raw
materials; therefore the figures are really
faked to the detriment of the manufacturing-
industry, and though it shows up well on
paper, it is .really better than it looks. The
agriculturist has railway freights that are
about one-fourth those charged to the manu-
facturer, also clieap labor, gratis child labor,
long-hours labor, a Government institution
to supply him with cheap money, and other
aids and advantages that no one dreams of
giving to the maker of tweed or builder of
boots. With it all, agriculture, in thesb days
of good rains and high prices, apparently
requires the aid of about as many people to
dig out £9,459,000 of value as manufactur-
ing does to produce £17,015,000 worth. And
last year the value of N.S.W. agricultOle
went down by £1,400,000, while the value of
manufactures went up by £2,479,000. In
fact, the growth of manufactures was almost
exactly equal to the growth of all the pri-
mary industries combined —cattle, sheep,
wool, bees, rabbits, dairying, mines, fowls,
forests, fisheries, and sundries.
* * * *
So, on the face of things, there is some-
thing rotten about the boasted agricultural
business of the Ma State, and it isn’t good
for things to be rotten with a big industry,
when there are fears of a recurrence of dry
seasons, and when a crazy Ministry is spend-
ing all it can borrow, and taking no more
thought for the future than if James
McGowen was a butterfly, which he cer-
tainly isn’t. One element of rottenness, of,
course, is the difficulty of getting crops to
market, and the better the crops the worse
the chance of getting them to market. The
vastness of this problem staggers the city
man who goes into the backblocks for thd
first time. Out in Riverina, last year’s
wheat is often still mouldering at the raiL
way stations w T hen the next year’s begins to
come in. It fills the sheds, when there abe
any sheds. It spreads far beyond the shed&
It rots in the sun and the rain. It gets moon-
struck, and is befouled by ’possums. It
sprouts, and the bags are covered with a
fresh green growth some inches long. It
grows mean and dirty and smellful. It is
eaten by horses and casual animals, which
get bits of torn bag in their teeth. The re-
mains of it are re-bagged and sold amid
curses for what they will fetch. All this
happens because there is only one port to
which the miserable agriculturist is allowed
to send his material, and that port is often
very far away, and the narrow road to it is
hopelessly overcrowded. He seems able to
get every kind of aid—cheap freights, cheap
money, cheap labor, seed wheat and charity
—except the one kind of aid that would do
him most good, which is a prompt sale for
his output. The cheap freights sometimes
do him more harm than good. They are all
right if he has the luck to get in early, but
the far-back man never gets in early. If he
arrives late, he has to wait till the wool has
all passed in, for wool pays high railway
charges, and a railway commissioner, who
has to make the lines pay, gives it the pref-
erence every time. In these circumstances,
the only thing the agriculturist can do is to
sell to' the middleman at; the middleman’s
own prices.
* * * *
For some years affairs grew, better with
the agriculturist, as seasons improved and
prices' went up. Then, as the output in-
creased, the other trouble struck him, and
affairs began to grow worse. Even at his
best, however, he never compared with the
manufacturer as a prop to the country. The
boss farmer often did well, and the boss
manufacturer often did very poorly ; but, as
an individual who supplied a decent
means of living to a large section
of the community, the manufacturer always
beat the -bucolic person our of sight. How
the latter will fare when the inevitable
drought comes back, is a question that re-
quires much thinking over. There are more
of him than there were during hist drought;
that is to say, when the driest time arrives
there will be a bia-geff load of derelict popu-
lation for the rest off the community to sup-
port—somehow. He is, in many cases, fur-
ther back in the dry region than he was in
1902, for the Government has always pre-
ferred to shove him right out towards the
top of the lid of Sheol rather than to en-
courage settlement near the coast, for
coastal settlement might lead to a compul-
sory opening up of some new ports, to the
detriment of the Sydney monopoly. On the
other hand, there is, most fortunately, a
much stronger manufacturing population to
carry the dry cripple on its back than there
was at the date of the last trouble. The
value of N.S.W. manufactures for 1911
showed an increase of £10,000,000 as com-
pared with 1905, while the value of agricul-
ture grew in the same period by only
£5,000,000. That £10,000,000 increase means
a great deal of extra carrying power. The
manufacturer has to do without most of the
aids —cheap land, cheap labor, cheap freights
and cheap money—that are supplied to the
farmer. But, at least, his new-laid boots
and his freshly-woven beer aren’t bogged for
weeks on the railway station at Boggabri.
However the inland grower of bulky go ids
may fare in his struggle to get his property
to the shore, there are always enough wool
trucks and cattle trucks and wheat trucks
going back to take a consignment of slop
clothes, and a gross of bluchers, and a keg of
malt liquor out into the wilderness.
* * * *
Yet, when all is considered, the next
drought, which may be a very adjacent
drought, promises to be a hard time. The
State Governments have learned nothing by
experience. The revenues grew in a won-
derful fashion during the good days, and the
6nly result was that the expenditure grew
as well, and the loans grew also, and the
habit of riotous living grew likewise. After
a long period of deficits, a bright noontide of
affluence came, when all the railway sys-
tems of the Australian mainland showed a
profit after paying interest and working ex-
penses. In one or two States things be-
came so good that all the public works
showed a profit. But even the pious
McGowen forgot the moral of Joseph and
the seven lean cows in Egypt. None of the
profit went to reduce the old debt, so that
there might be a smaller interest bill to
meet when the dry occasion came, and the
railway receipts were no longer on the same
lavish scale. None of it went to build new
works, so that there might be a scrap of
railway, or a dock, or a dredge, or even a
permanent and reproductive dog-kennel here
and there which wasn’t pawned up to the
ears. The only development was that the
loans were floated more vigorously, and
railways which were mortgaged to the last
penny of their value were pushed further
out into regions where they have the least
possible show of paying 1 per cent,
on their cost when the calamity of
1902 reproduces itself. “The best way
to make ourselves solid with the people
is to give them a good time while we are in
office:” That is the policy of McGowen, and
Denman, and fat John Verran, and appar-
ently) it is going to be the policy of Scadban,
of Westralia. And there the advantages of
Party Government shine as a lantern shines
on a wreck. The first essential is to make
“ourselves” solid with the most unreflecting
section of the people.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Subsidising Our Rival.
Among the numerous anomalies of the pre-
sent Australian tariff is the granting of a
bonus on the export of Australian-made
“tops”—not on the making of tops, but
solely upon the export. Tops are wool
partly prepared for the use of the manufac-
turer. Australia has gone through a num-
ber of stages in the wool business. It has
exported its wool with, the dirt in it, thereby
losing the dirt, which is a serious thing in a
country that is much too flat already; pay-
ing freight on the dirt; and losing the pro-
fits of the wool-washing industry. It has
exported washed wool, and thus saved the
dirt and the profits of the wool-washing in-
dustry. It has auctioned all its -wool in Eng-
land. It has improved things by auctioning
most of it in Australia, thereby saving some
commission and making a bit of money by
selling board, lodging and drinks to foreign
buyers who come here and howl promiscu-
ously in the season. It has, also, made a
smail amount of woollen cloth out of yarn
prepared locally. Finally, it has begun to
make tops for foreign use under the bounty
system, and, at present, it pays 14d. per lb.
to encourage the industry— provided the tops
on ivhich the bounty is paid are exported.
Now a bounty on the export of tops is a
good and wise thing, but the scheme would
be a lot better and wiser if there was at
least as large—perhaps a larger—bounty on
tops made here for use in Australian woollen
factories. As things are, the Australian top-
maker is able to supply this raw material of
the cloth maker nearly lid. per lb. cheaper
to the foreign manufacturer than to the
Australian one. And as an export trade has
sprung up—52,0851b. of tops were exported
in the first year of the bounty (1909), and
789,2161 b. in 1910, so the trade is arising
with a rush —it is plain that the Australian
maker, assisted by the bounty, is really able
to export tops to the foreigner quite as
cheap as, or a little cheaper than, the
said foreigner Used to make them him-
self. Then the alien turns the Australian
tops into cloth by the aid of foreign low-
wage and long-hour labor, and sends -a lot of
the cloth here, to climb over this country’s
verv inefficient tariff wall and compete with
the" product of the Australian manufacturer
who has to depend on high-wage and short-
hour labor. And that Australian manufac-
turer was up against a sufficiency of troubles
in the old days, without being taxed to sub-
sidise his foreign competitor with cheaper
raw material than he can get himself.
The Latter Day Troubles of J. Bull,
Freetrader.
A few days ago the cable reported—it. is
such a common report these days that it
hardly attracted more than a passing glance
—that sundry new strikes and riots had
broken out at Swansea (England). Various
premises were mentioned as being wrecked ;
an establishment or two was set afire ; and
the police failed badly in. their first attempt
to restore order, being beaten back and
chased halfway to the grave of Moses.
Times are gloomy in England, and the coun-
try is full of such shindies as it hasn't
known for more than half a century. The
working Bull isn’t a wildly intelligent per-
son. He doesn’t read many newspapers. He
knows little of political economy. He still
believes in Freetrade (theoretically, and as
a matter of form), just as he believes in
Heaven, and a material Sheol, and a personal
Devil with a caudal appendage. From an-
cient habit, he is content to hear his candi-
date state at election time: (1) That he is
the freest, best-fed and best-paid workman
on earth: (2) that he enjoys Cheap Food,
and the Big Loaf; (3) that under Protec-
tion he would have Dear Food, and a Small
Loaf, and be glad to eat horseflesh. He lis-
tens to these statements by way of ancient
precedent, just as—should he happen to be
a church-goer—he listens approvingly on
Sunday to the statement that he is a worm
and a miserable sinner. But, on week days,
and when he is not listening to the Freetrade
candidate, he knows that his wages are
going down and the price of his food is
going up; and, as he grows poorer, he
breaks things more blindly, and becomes
more and more like a hunger-maddened ani-
mal running amok. As a reason for his
anger, and his breakage, take this extract
from a recent statement issued by the Brit-
ish Board of Trade :
The amount of work for which the artisan re-
ceived, on the average, Bs. 4d. (lOOd.) in 1900 only
brought him Bs. in 1910. Decrease id.
The amount of bread which, in 1900, could be
bought for Bs. 4d. (lOOd.'i cost 9s. 6%d. in 1910.
Increase, Is. 2%d.
The amount of bacon which cost Bs. 4d. (lOOd.)
in 1900 had gone up to 11s. 6jd. in 1910. Increase
3s. 2id.
The amount of sugar purchasable in 1900 for
Bs. 4d. (lOOd.) cost 10s. 4£d. in 1910. Increase,
2s. Oid.
There were also large increases in the price
of flour, beef, mutton, butter, eggs, cheese,
currants, raisins, rice, tapioca, oatmeal,
cocoa, jam, treacle and«marmalade. Some of
these articles rose 40,. per cent., and this
general upheaval ha* driven the Bull
worker to desperation. He realises that
affairs have changed, but he can't quite
understand how they- have changed. When
he opened his ports ,fo foreign food supplies
in the early days of' Freetrade, all contin-
ental Europe, had victuals to sell. Competi-
tion gave him cheap food, and Bull’s own
agriculture was .allowed to go to perdition,
because he reckoned the foreign provender
cost less than the local article. Now the food
supply isn't anything like so great, in pro-
portion to the demand, as it used to be, and
the suppliers are able to put up prices
heavily against the one great country which,
having practically no supplies of its own, is
at their mercy. Meanwhile, Bull has to
sell immense quantities of manufactured
goods abroad to get money to pay for the
food he has to buy abroad, and many kinds
of manufactured goods grow more abundant
and cheaper, food becomes scarcer
and dearer, because foreign countries are
shoving their own industries ahead with
the aid of Protective tariffs. Tlnls
Bull gets mudh less in foreign mar-
kets for a given quantity of bricks,
candles, cement, coal, copper, ironware of all
sorts, steel, lead, spirits and tinware than he
did in 1900, and these are items of no small
size. This fall >in export values makes it
difficult to avoid a reduction here and there
in Bull’s wages. The great and inordinate
pride of Bull has long been in his immense
foreign trade. He got that immense foreign
trade through. bringing more of his food
from abroad than any other country did, and
having to sell more manufactured goods
abroad than any other country in order to
pay for his food. It was all right while he
bought foreign food cheap, and sold manu-
factured goods *to foreign nations dear. But
gradually it is becoming a case of buying
food dear and selling manufactured goods
cheap, because other countries have learned
to manufacture, and the struggle to find a
foreign market grows more and more in-
tense. The rise in food prices doesn’t seri-
ously affect a nation which grows its own
provender. It merely pays itself Id. for its
loaf instead of 2d. But it is Sheol for a
country which buys its food outside, and has
to pay someone else 4d. instead of 2d.

The Tote and the Blitherers.
It is a -curious fact that people who can dis-
cuss most subjects, in a spirit of horse-sense
become mentally incapable when they ap-
proach subjects like Contagious Diseases and
Gambling. From sensible citizens, they
change, in an instant, to blitherers of the
most awful description. Premier McGowen,
of N.S.W., when old Harry Levien intro-
duced his Totalisator Bill in N.S.W. Assem-
bly, the other night, upended himself, and
declared that he was against all legal recog-
nition of gambling. Now Premier McGowen
is a man of weight in more senses of the
word than one, and if he is not either a fool,
a hypocrite, or a plain rogue, why does lie
not introduce legislation to do away with
the legal recognition of gambling? Betting
on racecourses is specially provided for by a
State Act, which makes it illegal to bet any-
where else than on a racecourse. The re-
sult of the passing of that Act was to make
the fortunes of the proprietary racecourse
clubs. Rosehill, Warwick Farm, and Rose-
bery Park courses are flooded by thousands
of gamblers, who go there. not. to bet on the
races in progress, but on the big events—the
Epsom, the Metropolitan, the Sydney Gup.
the Caulfield Cup, the Melbourne Cup, the
Guineas, and other doings which . will take
place in the near future. All this betting,
wfliich, before the introduction of the pre-
sent system, was carried on in betting shops
in the city—Pitt-street chiefly—is now done
on some suburban horse track. The volume
of betting is not decreased in any way—
rather is it increased by the general atmo-
sphere of horse in which it is conducted—
and the only difference is that the man who
desires to waste his substance in gambling,
has to pay anything from 2s. to 7s. 6d. tq a
proprietary club for the privilege of doing
so. So not only does the State encourage
gambling, but it goes out of its way to en-
courage racing clubs. Therefore, if Premier
McGowen is not a humbug and a hypocrite,
let him quickly introduce legislation to put
down betting on all racecourses, or, at least,
on all future events. Apparently, he dare
not do it, or doesn’t want to do it. How-
ever, he is not the only blitherer at large,
although he can certainly claim a high place
among blitherers. xinother humbug ot the
same order butted into print in r riday s
Telegraph, and objected to the introduc-
tion of the Tote, because it would not pre-
vent men who now gambled with the earn-
ings of their wives at the wash-tub continu-
ing to do so. He also declared that the money
derived by the State for charitable purposes
from the Tote would do no real good, as the
money came from a tainted source. Tin
same humbug has probably often handled
money that came almost direct from a
brothel, a bookmaker, or a sly-grog shop,
and it is £lOOO to a gooseberry that he
never makes inquiries, when he gets change,
as to the source from which the vendor ob-
tained it. The strangest part of the busi-
ngs is that this particular humbug and
hypocrite, while opposing the introduction ot
the Tote, did not advocate the ahobtmn o
the bookmaker. Which, in one of his arctic
purity, was a strange omission, and woum
suggest that he was merely a bookie s lme
lino- in disguise. The bookmakers cnmd
has now got down to the level °f argnm?

An Unwholesome Deathbed.
The third and last session of the Mtjrray-
Watt Parliament lingered slowly to a disre-
putable end. Premier John came back
from England to renew the comedy of his
perpetual slumbers. He looked more like a
somnolent steer than ever; he seldom ap-
peared in Parliament; and when his inert
bulk was intruded into that dead-and-alive
gathering, he did not once make a pretence
of understanding the business he was sup-
posed to be steering. Willie Watt was
harassed and haggard, having been doped by
his “followers” with more Conservative pills
than are good for a politician who beguiles
a fairly Radical constituency to elect him.
For weeks it was evident that the Govern-
ment would not, and could not, pass any of
the important legislation on its swollen pro-
gramme. Its history for a month was a
series of degrading surrenders to the Tory
section of the remnants which make up
“Liberalism.” Not one statute worth men-
tioning, except that for preferential voting,
got through Parliament in a whole session.
You may dredge political history in Vic-
toria, and hardly find quite so barren a
record. Bills were introduced, but as soon
as they were found to be unwelcome to the
squealing Conservatism which makes hide-
ous noises in Victoria these days, they were
dropped in a corner and forgotten. There
were three measures which promised some
kind of organisation in matters which, in
Victoria, are chaotic horrors at present—
the Workmen's Compensation Bill, the
Charities Bill, and the Apprentices Bill.
They were all deliberately delayed, the last
of them appearing only while Parliament
was in its death-aeony. To his eternal dis-
credit, Willie Watt surrendered to a
“country members’ ” cry that workmen’s
compensation should be absolutely denied to
all men engaged in rural occupations, how-
ever hazardous. He branded himself with
the guilt of saying that farm laborers must
be killed or maimed without any of the com-
pensation allowed to all other workmen, and
his only excuse was that hard-shell Tories
like Mackey, Robertson and others were
touting for the votes of the greediest farmers
in their electorates. But all the Murray-
Watt Bills were dead anywy, for the
reason that the present “Liberal” conglom-
eration has not, and never can have, any
policy on which it is united. Its sections
merely intrigue against one another, and
make politics a game for their own mean
advantage. At the end, the motley gang
behind' Watt anti Murray simply told the
Ministry to go to the Devil, and bring its
disreputable session to an close. They would
not stay in Parliament when they wanted
to go electioneering. Thus contemptuously
booted out of their sham of legislation, the
Ministry will face the country with a policy
of money-borrowing and road-building and
railway-bribing and vague promises, with
some loud talk aDout an immigration move-
ment, which movement, so far as it exists, is
more due to the Federal Labor policy than
to anything else. Various Parliaments may
have merited more cursing than this one,
but never a Parliament in Victoria deserved
more contempt.
The Fate of the Taviuni.
A Marine Veteran writes:—
The inquiry into the cause of the Nera-Taviuni
collision in Sydney Harbor produced this result: —
“The Court found that the collision was caused by
the wrongful act of Captain Beighton in failing to
keep his ship on a proper course—namely, well to
the northward and westward of the mid-line of the
channel, when he was aware, as he was approaching
the turn into Darling Harbor, that the Nera was be-
ginning to back out from her berth on a line that
would take her across the channel, and that her
stern might have occasion to approach near tp, or
even to pass, that mid-line about the time that the
Taviuni would cross the Nera’s line of motion.”
In that case, there is no fairway channel at all in
Port Jackson, and when a big ship like the Nera is
backing out from her wharf, she may require the
whole width of the channel to manoeuvre in, leaving
practically no space for vessels passing up and down
the harbor. The distance between Blue’s Point and
Miller’s Point, where this collision occurred, is only
about three lengths of the Nera, and it is not, by
any means, the worst place in the harbor. Just
above is Goat Island with its naval depot and pow-
der magazine, while a little below is old Pinchgut with
its antique fort, stuck right in the middle of the fair-
way. We have been told that the Messageries Mari-
times Co., the owners of the Nera. are about to with-
draw their ships from the Australian trade, but other
and larger ships are coming. Only a few months
ago, the White Star line put two 45,000-ton ships,
the Olympic and the Titanic, into the trans-Atlantic
trade. The same line has ordered two -TG.OOO-tonners
for the Australian line, and we may be sure there
will be more and larger craft to follow. It is only
a repetition of what has been going on in Europe
and America for the last two or three years. Ship-
owners find that large ships are much more profitable
than small ones. The coal-bill and the wages bill do
not increase in the direct ratio of the tonnage or
carrying capacity. The builders have met the owners
squarely, and are quite ready to build hulls as large
as may be required. There is talk of building ships
of 100,000 tons and 1000 ft. long.
In any case, Port authorities have been driven by
the great and rapid increase in the size of ships to
provide berthing accommodation. The Hudson River,
at New York, is normally, 4000 ft. wide, and it has
been widened. It has been found necessary, too, to
lengthen the jetties which project from each bank
to 1000 ft. each to safely accommodate the new ships.
Still there is a clear fairway between the heads of
the jetties of 2650 ft. wide, seven miles long and 40ft.
deep, for ships to pass up and down without jost-
ling each other. Practically there is no fairway in
Port Jackson, according to the decision in the
Taviuni case, since it is held that a ship-backing out
from her berth at a wharf may cross'-'‘the mid-line
of the channel,” and any other-ship passing up or
down the channel does .so_ at her peril. What will
happen when the new White Star liners arrive, each
of twice the tonnage of the Nera, it is impossible to
guess; but before long something will have to be
done to provide a fairway channel which will be
always free for the passage of ships up and down
the harbor. The Liverpool bar*' which, a few years
ago,, had only lift, of water in the channel at low
tides, has now 30, thanks to the Leviathan, an enor-
mous sand-pump dredge of 10,000 tons capacity,
capable of filling herself in 50 minutes. The fair-
way of the Mersev, at Liverpool, is from 2000 ft. to
2400 ft. wide. The fairway of the Thames varies
from 600 ft. at London Bridge to 1600 ft. at Tilbury
Docks, and it is now being widened. Nowhere else
in the world is there a great commercial seaport
with such a narrow, obstructed, winding channel in
its harbor as Sydney. Something will have to be
done before long to take the kinks out of it. If
Port Jackson cannot be widened, part of the trade
must be taken to some other port. Where shall it
be?

The Inoffensive, Non-defensive Quaker.
“Henry Horsecoelar” writes :
I notice that a’ Quaker gentleman from England
has been in Australia preaching the gospel of non-re-
sistance, and urging this country to remain feeble
and unprotected, and trust to Providence. Also,
that some more Quakers jn England have been pray-
ing hard for sorijp alleged youths in Australia, who
prefer, they say, to be scorned and despised, and
even imprisoned, rather than do their military train-
ing.
I mention with regret that these Quaker martyrs
make me fe.el tired. The ones I am speaking of live
habitually in England under the protection of the
greatest fleet and the most expensive military and
naval armaments in the world. Though they won’t
fight themselves, they pay men to fight for them,
which is quite as bad, if not worse, but not nearly
so dangerous. In fact, it seems a case of cowardice
rather than principle. They, are prepared to go to
prison (which is a nice safe place) rather than de-
fend themselves, but they won’t -go to prison to
avoid paying other meq—some of them men of very
bad character —for defending them. I admit that
not even a Quaker can well avoid paying customs
and excise, for these imposts are included in the
price of his food. But he can move that the public
expenditure of Britain be reduced by the amount
annually “blewed” on the army and navy,' and he can
give point to his protest by refusing to pay income-
tax (that being' a large item in the national defence
bill, and originally a war-tax pure and simple),
and by reason of this refusal he can, if he feels
that way, become a martyr for his faith in gaol or
elsewhere. If he went to gaol over the income-tax,
he would at least have done his best to avoid being a
hirer of mercenary soldiers and sailors, a butcher by
deputy, a slayer by proxy, a layer-waste per medium
of his agent, and one who depended at second-hand
on the arm of flesh instead of upon Divine protection.
Somehow, I never hear of the anti-defence or peace
society person doing this sort of thing. He mostly
seems to lurk behind the security of a serviceable
army and a good terrace of war'ships. He might'
put his doctrine of non-resistance to the test by set-
tling largely in countries like Tripoli or Morocco or
Arabia or Thibet, or Southern Persia, or interior
China, where his money wouldn’t go so extensively
in payment for sinful armaments, and where, for lack
of sufficient police arid soldiers, there is every chance
to show a boundless faith in Providence. ' A non-.
resister has an opportunity to develop in these places,
for there is something for him not-to-resist. But
does the sect rush spots of the sort? Not that I ever
heard of. It sticks very closely to Britain and the
United States —countries where well-organised cops
and troops will die in the last ditch rather than let
a profound believer, in peace at any price have a
chance to give serious evidence of his faith.
There, this well-meaning but incomprehensible con-
gregation resists foreign aggression just as much as
it would in any compulsory service country, but it
does the violent deed at second-hand. It is as much
an employer of warlike men and a buyer of ammuni-
tion as if it were a Visconti or a Sforza or a Col-
onna of olden Italy, though it does the deed in a
passive way.
One might think that a man, whose conscience
bids him rather go to gaol than shoot with his own
hand, should gladly go to two, or even three, gaols
rather than pay another man to shoot, lest his act
should lead to a cannon-ball striking an unrepentant
fellow-creature in the stomach, whereupon he (the
unrepentant one) might go to a much worse place
than the Quaker would go to if the missile struck
his own personal stomach. But these eminently
peaceful folk are disappointing all round. They
supply money for the wages of fierce and gory-
minded soldiers, because they mustn’t resist the tax-
gatherer. Yet they don’t go, out themselves and lend
the campaign an air of respectability, because they
may resist the recruiting officer. I don’t think there
is a sadder spectacle anywhere than that of a man
of peace, fighting like thunder with the recruiting
officer to avoid going to war at a time when there
is no war for him to go to, and clamoring for arbi-
tration when he has stated already that he won’t pay
any attention to the verdict unless it squares with
his conscience. The only way to make arbitration a
sure success every tim.e is for nobody to have any
conscience. As a solid matter of fact, the reason
why the early Quakers were flogged so frequently
was because they wouldn’t arbitrate.
Private Enterprise Again.
A postscript (re private schools) to the
first report of Victoria’s new Council of
Education makes grim reading. The In-
spector remarks that he “lias found
schools conducted in back kitchens, sheds, cel-
lars, disused stables and hay lofts aporoached
by ladders. A large number of schools are in a
dangerously insanitary condition... . Chil-
dren breathe aerial sewage, are subject to
eye-strain, study in dirty and dilapidated '
surroundings, and are often in charge of in-
competent teachers.” This pleasing tribute
to Private Enterprise was written in Janu-
ary last, the Council of Education con-
sidered it in June, and it is made public in
October —from which it will be observed that
there is nothing hasty about the Weary
State’s Education bosses. The council is
understood to have “made representations”
to the proprietors of the establishments in
question, and to have also communed with
the Board of Health on the matter, but, so
far, nobody has heard anything drop. The
Weary Government’s Education Act was
framed and passed with the object of forc-
ing private schools to make themselves at
least as healthy and effective as the State
schools. But like so many other democratic
measures passed by Tory Governments, it is
the administration that counts. And the
brand of that article in Victoria is Weary.

The Need for Cheap War.
One of these days there will arise a demand
for Cheap Strife. War, as practised by the
most elaborate nations, has become so ex-
pensive as to be almost unattainable. Last
week it was announced —though it seems im-
possible—that Italy after being on the scrim-
mage with Turkey for 20 days, had got
through £20,000,000—£1,000,000 a day.
Of course, this included preliminary ex-
penses, but even when the little war is in
full blast, it may cost £lOO,OOO a day. And
all there is to show for the outlay so far is
the capture of two mouldy old towns that
are only fit to be condemned and pulled
down. The Tripolitans have certainly been
chased out of these towns, but they seem to
have retreated cheaply into the desert be-
hind, where they are leading the simple, in-
expensive life, and waiting for the Italians
to advance. And the Italians are in a tight
place. The country ahead of them is hot
and sandy, and the roans are few and awful.
They have about £1,000,000 worth of
deadly apparatus with them, hut they can’t
well drag it over the sand. And if they
leave the apparatus behind them- —well, they
are used to fighting with the apparatus,
while the Arabs are used to fighting without
it; and if the Italian abandons his thousand
tons of ponderosity, and goes out to do a
scrap in the old cheap fashion, lie will be
out of his element, and the Arab will pro-
bably win. The interest on the gigantic
heap of scientific military luggage is piling-
up all the time, and it looks as if the Dago
can neither carry it nor leave it behind. War
in Western Europe seems to have got back
in some respects to the methods of the-Mace-
donian phalanx, which was a tremendous
and almost invincible weapon when it really
got at its enemy, just as the megatherium
made short work of the sparrow when it got
that fowl down and sat on it. But as the
phalanx could only work on large and fairly
level spaces, and against an enemy who
waited for it to waddle up, its career
was short. Some 2000 years ago
Macedonia (which is now Turkey)
was wiped out while its tremendous
military formation was trying to turn round,
and it was Rome (now Italy) which wiped
it out with its swift, handy legions. Now,
after a long interval, the same two empires
are at it again, but this time Rome is tot-
tering owing to the cumbrous nature and
dead weight of the bill and the outfit, which
are a great deal heavier than the phalanx
ever was, while it is Macedonia’s turn to fly
light.. It begins to look as if a new hope
was Arising for the folk of the deserts —those
who have no valuable coastal cities, and no
roads, and little agriculture, and no com-
merce worth speaking of; who are willing to
sleep under the stars and live in the saddle,
and howl and make a great dust in the dead?
waste and middle offfhe night. There wafe a‘
time when the European was about as swift
as the semi-savage—the day when the Span-
iard marched over half America, and a hand-
ful of Portuguese soldiers fought their way
through Arabia. But now the advanced
nations have heaped up dead weights of iron-
clads and cannon and ammunition, and have
devised enormously bulky methods of but-
chery. which are very deadly when one ad-
vanced nation meets another, but which are
of little account when an advanced nation
starts out after a primitive horde of horse-
men, who are just a dust cloud on the hori-
zon. Then it is like an alligator, at a high
salary, pursuing an unpaid butterfly; like a
Dreadnought running after a shadow; like a
policeman pounding along in chase of a
mote. It is impossible to suppose that such
cheap and airy cattle as the Arabian riders
will be able to attack the white man in his
own dominions, for that would be the butter-
fly attacking the alligator. But it certainly
does look as if the great tortoise of Europe
had loaded itself with such a ponderous,
shell that it hasn’t the same capacity fori
stealing the territory of cheap, light-weight'
nations as of old. Apparently, a European)
communitx,which desires to, spread Into the
country of military savages requires to keer
two kinds of war on hand —a large, costly,
elaborate, cart-horse article for European
use, and a light, swift, cheap, lath*
and-plaster, racing-skiff or gas-bag affair
for exportation. _ It is the want of;
that cheap, fast, jerry-built war that threat-
ens to undo Italy. The total State revenue
of Tripoli is £150,000 a year, and, according
to report, Italy began by spending six
years’ revenue in a day in its efforts to
take the place. That suggests sending a
traction engine after a grasshopper. But if
a country has nothing to send save a trac-
tion engine, what else can it send?
—<+
The seasons are good just now in South
Australia, and the wheat crops are large,
and prices are fair, and the Crow-eater is
feeling very well, thank you. If Premier
Vebran were like the bee he might regard
this as a time in which to lay by a little
honey for the winter, but that corpulent per-
son presents no earthly resemblance to the
bee. He doesn’t propose to pay off a little
of the public debt, or to borrow a trifle less
and build some of his new railways out of
revenue, so that there will.be less interest
to pay when the drought comes back and the
rabbits are dying in the streets. Rather, he
proposes to reduce taxation just when the
community is best able to stand taxation,
and to bring the surplus down to nothing,
and to pay for all the new public works out
of loans. Later on, the drought will recur,
and the railway revenue and all the other
items of revenue will show a falling off.
Then fat Premier Vekran —assuming that
the community hasn’t thrown him out in dis-
gust by that time —will have to put up taxes
when the country is least able to stand new
taxes. At present the S.A. railways show a
very fine surplus over working expenses and
interest. Seeing that one of the railways
will be of very little value when the Broken
Hill mines give out, and that the rest do
very little good in dry times, it might be re-
garded as a fair thing to apply that present
surplus to the.feduction of the railway debt.
It would only be a reasonable provision for
the future, but fat Premier Vekran doesn’t
seem to realise that there is any future. He
is a pious man, who preaches occasionally
and urges his congregation not to live for the
passing moment but to look ahead; yet in
his political capacity he might as well be a
butterfly or an atheist for all the looking-
ahead he does. There is no butterfly like the
atheist, and the fattest atheist is the most
complete butterfly.

“The Traveller”: The Vic. railway au-
thorities are cor=frnoting a hill on the flat
near the North Melbourne station, at a cost
of about £50,000, in order to form a “gravi-
tation” yard for the goods traffic. The
present goods yard at '-’"oadv
spread out to the Victoria Dock) is
crowded ouc. Bui uie ..vtorian
fool idea of rushing everything to Melbourne
must be kept up, just the same as the
idiotic scheme of jamming everything down
the bottle-neck of Sydney. In Vic. the run-
ning of trains by weight, velocity, or mo-
mentum is becoming—has become, in fact—
a great scheme. On many lines goods trains
are chased like greased Sheol down long in-
clines, in order that they may ricochet up
the other side. The engine-power would
not take half the load over otherwise. A
year or two ago a conference of the Feder-
ated Locomotive men made several disre-
spectful remarks about the practice, and
those who ought to know are nightly expect-
ing a train to aeroplane into Moonee Ponds
Creek at Pascoe Vale. In “gravitation”
shunting the trucks are drawn on to a grade
of 1 in 75 or thereabouts. Thence they are
“dropped” by hand, and drafted into the
lines below. All night and all dav the
crash of buffer to buffer goes on. Wheat,
potatoes, firewood, coal, produce of all kinds,
as well as pieces of trucks, lie inches deep,
between the rails, while hundreds of trucks:
are,always in the repair shops. Meanwhile
the farmer has to pay for all the round-
about haulage to the biood-sucking metropo-
lis. and the wreckage of rolling-stock caused
by the maddened rush frequently leaves his
harvest rotting on his hands, for lack of
truck accommodation.
Various Australian Insurance Institutes
have had fired at them a paper on
“Popular Fallacies with regard to Fire
Insurance,” and the document is now
being sprinkled over the continent. One
of the most dreadful fallacies, it seems, has
been observed in connection with the Maori-
land State Fire Office:—
The net result has been to demonstrate—
1. That even a State cannot ignore the scientific
basis of average ; and
2. That, having unduly cheapened the cost of in-
surance, the State has introduced an excessive fire
waste, which is. a disaster both for the material and
moral welfare of the community.
It is a particularly cheeky and clumsy at-
tempt to hit a State enterprise with dis-
credit and other bricks, and hold it respon-
sible for arson and other cheerful crimes. As
a matter of fact, before the State Office
opened its doors, the insurance cos. doing
business in Maoriland phlled down the rates
by as, much as one-third on most of the Do-
minion’s business. The State office hadn’t;
proposed any such violent reduction, and has
repeatedly declared that it was too severe.
And, no doubt, it was intended to be too
severe—so severe, in fact, that the State in-
fant would be strangled in its cradle. How-
ever, the baby-murder didn’t come' off;
nevertheless, one hardly expected the gentle
creatures to blame the baby for the desper-
ate attempt that failed.
The same old narrative again:—
The promise made by the Premier at Kalgoorlie on
Friday to introduce a Bill for the construction of a
line from the goldfields to Esperance ha's caused un-
easiness in commercial circles in Perth and Fre-
mantle, where the project has always met with
strenuous opposition. The construction of the line
would, it is feared, direct a lot of the goldfields’’
trade from Fremantle to Esperance.
It is the. curse of Australia that the biggest,
commercial centre always fancies that it is.
to its interest to squash, repress, discourage,,
and, if possible, obliterate every other com-
mercial centre. The merchants have a
crazy idea that, no matter though a State-
may be as big as one-third of Europe, there-
is only room in it forgone port for ocean-
going vessels. The big port wants to be the-
solitary wart on a boundless landscape. In>
this' respect, the conduct of the ignorant
variety of Labor mini who seeks to shut out
all immigration is sane and dignified beside
that of the business person who seeks to-
keep the whole coast a desert save just
where his office abuts on the shore. The
..Labor individual objects to the people who

Britain Protests.
The “Old Soldier” sees a nigger- in the
distance:—
The Mediterranean tangle, instead of straightening
itself out, is getting more mixed every day, and it
will be a clever Government that manages to keep
itself out of the net that is being woven by the
happy-go-lucky set of gamblers, and waiters-on-
Providence on the Roman Bourse. Says the cable: —
“Sir Edward Grey. Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs, has protested against Italy’s proposal to
blockade 200 miles of Egyptian coast. The ancient
controversy as to Egypt’s real boundary has been
revived.”
It is a very old controversy, and has slept peace-
fully for nearly 2000 years. “Egypt’s real boundary”
'to the west is fairly plain. It is the ancient Libyan
Desert, a place that is no use to man or beast.
Where Italy wants to fix it the cable doesn’t say.
A naval war, carried on in Italian style, is, no
doubt, a nuisance to neutrals, and is calculated to
arouse protests re boundaries or any other old thing.
Blockading a coast that has no trade to speak of is
useless for any practical purpose except to wear out
the ships, and work the crews to death. Bombard-
ing little mud forts to knock down their flags is.
a wipked waste of good ammunition, which may be
much wanted later on. It really looks as if the Turks
had an idea Qf giving their enemy rope enough to
hang himself. A naval war is a beautiful and ter-
rible thing to speculate about. No one really
knows what would happen if a couple of up-to-date
fleets had a fight to a finish. It might be a very
good thing if such a scrap could be brought about
for once in a way. All we know is that the biggest
and most powerful battleship cannot go overland, or
into shallow water. It is also liable to sudden and
total destruction by torpedoes or submarine mines.
It is popularly supposed to be able to destroy, with
its big guns, any object its crew can see at ranges
up to 20 miles, more or less, though that is not quite
certain. What is certain is that the modern war-
ships cannot keep the sea for long without going
rapidly to the bad. They are great floating boxes
of delicate machinery, which must go into dock or to
the repair shop at frequent intervals, to have their
defects made good. Already, the “repair ship” is a
recognised attendant of every sea-going fleet. So is
the hospital sh;p, because it is not only inhuman,
but a practical working impossibility to keep sick
and wounded men for treatment on board a modern
fighting vessel. Everything is done with a view to
an equal contest with a reasonably equal antagonist,
and to seriously engage a manifestly inferior an-
tagonist, like the mud forts on which the, Italians
have been wasting their substance in riotous shoot-
ing, is a piece of senseless folly. Not only is the
ammunition spent, but the guns are corroded and
worn away by every shot fired, and the ships are
shaken and weakened. The country that wears out
£lOOO in a heavv bombardment of twopence is a
fool, and that is what Italy is doing.
One of the pleasant jests of the week was
N.S.W. Senator McDougall’s proposition,
carried with enthusiasm in the Senate: —
That all Government establishments for the manu-
facture or supply of goods for the Federal public ser-
vice should, when practicable, be located in the
Federal capital territory.
And the Federal capital territory isn’t
in a coal district. It hasn’t water
power to take the place of coal —-in
fact, unless the capital is a very
small city indeed it will have to pump up
drinking water for its inhabitants. It is to
depend for its outlet either on the congested
lines that lead to Sydney, or on Jervis Bay,
where it hasn’t enough land to build a sea-
port town, and where its water frontage
stops at high-water mark. There has even
been talk of trying to borrow water power
from the State-owned Snowy River, on the
abandoned Dalgety site, and bringing _it
great distances by wire in order to provide
electric light for the capital. Its fuel will
have to be humped long distances at great
cost. In fact, Canberra has all the ear-
marks of a place that wasn’t intended for
the manufacture of anything.
«
There have been very few strikes in Aus-
tralia that received less sympathy than that
which took place a few days ago among a
certain section of the Sydney lumpers.
Th'ere was about it little justification and
much cussedness. Indirectly, it did the
State Labor Government no good, for that
body showed up as a feeble institution, which
was half desirous of doing something, and
wholly unable to decide what to do. James
McGowen hasn’t been a glaring success as
Premier, though ne shines as a fairly bright
star by contrast with G. Wade; and the
recent troubles have dimmed his light con-
siderably.
The sort of thing Speaker Willis has to
put up with in N.S.W. Assembly, because he
left the party which howls to the uttermost
stars that its members are free to do as they
like: —•
Mr. Wood : That fictitious majority of one has been
made up by a gentleman who has been purchased.
The'Chairman : I ask the hon. member for Darling-
hurst, who has made the interjection, “Do you call
the hon. member for the Upper Hunter a gentle-
man?” to withdraw that statement.
Mr. Levy : I withdraw that. I withdraw the state-
statement that the occupant of the chair is a gentle-
man.
Still, you can’t make a silk purse out of the
wrong kind bf material.

Gounod’s “Romeo and Juliet,” produced
last week at Sydney Majesty’s, gives Melba
the same opportunity of hooding the air
with a torrent of brilliant vocalisations which
made her incomparable in “Traviata” and
“Rigoletto.” The latter opera reduced the
list of prima donna star items, but the gor-
geous trimming of “Caro Nome” was built
tor the bird-like warbling of Australia’s sky-
lark. As Juliet, Melba looked younger on
Monday night than in any other part she
has taken during the present season. This
was lucky, for an obviously eldei’ly Juliet
would have, been tragedy. Melba-Juliet, in
the popular waltz song, attacked the public
taste in its most vulnerable place, with sen-
sational top notes, a glittering scale of ex-
ceptional beauty of tone, and a cadenza
that made applause boil over on the Ange-
lini orchestra. The members of that orches-
tra, deserved a laurel leaf apiece. Scandi-
ani s Mercutio was the polished production
the public expects from this fine artist. Ty-
balt (Quesnel) waddled into the masque
scene, looking like the fat boy in “Pickwick”
(much astonished to find himself in foreign
parts), and made a satisfactory corpse
later in the evening. Tenor John McCor-
mack’s gold mine was in first-class working
order on Monday night, though Romeo’s
love song is sometimes set rather low to
show off the beauty of the McCormack
upper register. John, in spite of his habit
of pawing the air with his hands during all
emotional remarks to Juliet, made one of
his great successes in the Capulet and
Montague story. The balcony scene was
overcrowded with too much Stephano, Mrs.
de Cisneros taking the part of Romeo’s
page. Eleonora is too large and fat to
plunge round with a rapier as a boy page,
and she introduced beef instead of poetry
into the serenade. Gounod’s “feeling” for
sacred music is very marked in the serious
themes that give an organ tone to much of
the beautiful orchestration in “Romeo and
Juliet.” Edmund Burke’s feeling for the
part of Count Capulet is full of lead. If
Burke’s fine voice could wrestle with, and
overthrow, the dull personality that chains
it down, his dead march through opera might
occasionally approximate a Boston hop.
Rosina Buckman’s intelligence was too ap-
parent under the cap of Juliet’s old fool
nurse.

There have been many editions of “The
Silver King”; but people are always glad
to consider a new one. The present version
of the ripe old melo., at Sydney Royal, is
claimed to be the best the local playgoer has
yet been offered, though, when one considers
a whole procession of past performances, in-
cluding that in which the King was done by
the late lamented Scot Inglis, the assertion
is a ridiculously large one. Still, the co.,
headed by William Desmond and Dorothy
Dix, includes some names the stalled first-
nighter is always glad to see on the bill;
and the play itself is, of course, sterling
stuff of its kind. In construction it is sev-
eral storeys above the average slipshod bel-
low, and the skilled treatment of the present
capable cast lifts it another floor or two.
King Desmond, rather inclined to overdo it
in the murder scene, finds his feet and uses
them when his race with the police is fairly
started. The jumpy scene in the inn, when
he is waiting for the paper, after his escape,
is finely acted. Thereafter he is the usual
interesting, commanding figure who demands
carefully modulated sympathy. Dorothy
Dix makes a handsome, appealing Nellie
Denver; it is a mighty long appeal, but her
fine voice and artistic restraint make it less
monotonous than it might be, and she is
•always graceful. By far the best thing of
the production, however, is the Jaikes of
J. B. Atholwood. At the breathless end of
a hot-wind day, the joyous cackle of the
old servitor, as he heaps wood on the cottage
fire, makes the perspiring audience experi-
ence a midwinter thrill of gladness ; and the
sight of his bowed back and crumpled ban-
dana always draw the responsive eye mois-
ture. Cyril Mackay’s dapper, incisive Cap-
tain Skinner is a finished piece of work.
Ambrose Manning presents an amusing,
well-oiled and fruity Elijah Coombe. Leslie
Victor steps gaily as the impudent, light-
weight rogue, Henry Corkett. Ivy Mar-
shall, as Olive Skinner; Mrs. George Lauri,
as the old dame Tabitha Durden; and Alma
Phillips, as Susy, deserve honorable men-
tion ; as also do the three cronies of the
inn. The play is mounted in the usual
complete Williamsonian manner.

“Captain Ivate,” a picture which the Ly-
ceum swears solemnly was taken in the
jungles of Africa, and not in the Zoo, was
the Spencer theatre’s chief film during the
week. It is a big-game story, full of lions,
tigers, leopards and other excitements. “The
Monuments of Florence” and “Lisbon” were
good scenic films, and “The Making of Cot-
ton Goods” was a fine hint to Australia to
get work. The feature of the new programme
is an historical picture, “The Reign of Ter-
ror.”
* * *
Sam Mayo, the quaint and doleful come-
dian, is the strong suit of the re-opened
Tivoli. Some of the jokes which Mayo
extracts so painfully are not as funny
as they would be if they were more humor-
ous, but his low-spirited dressing gown and
his general air' of hopelessness help him to
success. Albert Rees, a Jrawing-room en-
tertainer with a remarkable range of voice,
infuses some freshness into the programme.
The Finneys’ tank act is a grateful specta-
cle these sweltering nights, and a gasp of
envy goes up from the perspiring as the per-
formers slide gracefully into the cool depths.
Comedians Armstrong and Kelly, Zelini
(juggler!, Daly and O’Brien, and the Sax-
ony pair (dancers) supply the rest of the
entertainment.
“LA TOSCA,” AT
SYDNEY HER
MAJESTY’S.
The painter (Me Cor-
mack) decides to
hide Kaujmann
from prying policemen .
“Mrs. McSweeney,” the dramatised ver-
sion of the late Thos.' E. Spencer’s book,
now clattering along at the Criterion, is
necessarily a loose-jointed production. Each
of the four acts has been built round one
of Mrs. McSweeney’s “adventures,” and is
quite distinct from the act next door. An
unconvincing love, story is the frayed thread
that holds the play together. It manages
to run through the four acts, but only by
stretching ’for all it is worth, and tying
itself into one or two knots towards the end.
Maggie Moore, who grapples with the title
role, says it is one of the hardest she ever
tackled. She is scarcely ever off the stage.
When she is, the play really waits for her
return, the other people being present only
to be pelted with her stock of homely wit and
wisdom. E. B. Russell does very well as
Mr. McSweeney—an amiable, blundering,
sentimental old Irishman, who plays second
fiddle to his wife, and is inordinately proud
of the privilege. Arthur Shirley, as Plan-
tagenet Fordham, is the stereotyped dude
of melodrama, and -overacts entertainingly
when he" might just as easily get a little
closer to nature. Rowland Conway tries
hard to :be the boisterous, irresistible boy-
lover, and fails in no uncertain manner. The
women of the supporting co. are uniformly
good. Miss Gladys Comstock, as Norah
Ransome, was suffering severely from ner-
vousness on the first night; but she is a
graceful young actress. Miss Betterton
Glover, as Mrs. Gresham, a mincing Eng-
lishwoman, and Beatrice Esmond, as Mrs.
Moddle, an aggressive female emancipation-
ist, earn the word that cheers. Dulcie Hall,
an athletic girl pupil of “Snowy” Baker,
says her few lines crisply and gives an en-
tertaining display of self-defence. Mar,ie
Bruce, as Mrs. Tacitus, Mrs. McSweeney’s
helpful, sly off-sider, is absolutely true to
type, her clever by-play being delightful to
watch. A pair of younger twins, with less
piercing voices, might be provided; also,
numerous, opportunities for the pruning-
knife become visible during the progress of
the performance.

There has descended upon Australia a
“Tiny Town” company, run by one Zey-
nard, with some help from Beaumont Smith.
Giving its first show at Adelaide Exhibition,
it proves to be an encampment upon rather
American lines, with post office, hotel, and
so on, tenanted only during show time, and
a circus-ring, in which various turns are
given at intervals. There are a score of
little people all about a yard high, picked
from among a crowd of European competi-
tors as being well-proportioned, and not un-
attractive, and, also, as being able to “do
something.” The Strong Man is a cham-
pion at his weight, and some of the little
people are charming company. The ponies
—about the size of large dogs—add interest
to the show.

Adelaide Literary Theatre has got busy
again with two evenings of Ibsen’s “Master
Builder” —not quite new, but seldom seen.
It got the usual Ibsen hearing, which con-
sists of yawns at the unending talk (mostly
leading to nothing), and rapt attention lest
something vital should be missed. liay Walsh
was sound and natural as the slightly-mad
builder, with his middle-aged fear of the
younger generation; so was Miss Muriel
Craigie, as the weary, jealous wife. J3ut
the occasion was a personal triumph for
Miss Dorothea Jacob, as the free-spoken,
free-striding minx, who, having been kissed
at 12 by her father’s guest, comes at 22 to
remind him of it, and make a personal claim
on him in consequence. The symbolism of
the play is telling; the realism of it unreal.
Pantomime has ceased at the Royal, and
Premier Verran is no longer praised nightly
for his politeness in giving his seat in a
tramcar to three ladies. Comedian Cannot
says he is going to join a “Girl in the
Train” co. Miss Ethel Irving has just come
in with “The Witness for the Defence.” Tim
Tivoli is open again after a week of mourn-
ing ; at the King’s, are Eva Mudge, Leon-
ard Nelson and other popular people and
other shows in a busy week have included
a Conservatorium concert, at which Wins-
loe Hall’s ladies class gave a song-cycle of
his own composing to words by his wife
(Georgina Delmar). ' '
The passing bill at Her Majesty’s (Meib.)
is a feast of horrors and a flow of ghoul, so
to speak. 11. B. Irving and co., in a. free
and fearsome dramatisation of Stevenson’s
“Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,” are bringing a
blush of confusion to “The Face at the
Window.” In its love for the gruesome and
fondness for nightmare effects, “Jekyll and
Hyde” yields to no drama ever staged by
Bilanderson in his giddy, gory managerial
youth. Yet it is only moderately thrilling.
Jekyll, who ought to be as pure and proper
as Joseph Lesurques in “The Lyons Mail,"’
puts himself beyond the pale of Wowser
sympathy by owning up to an abandoned
amour with Lady Carew (Miss -Irene
Brown), an intensely theatrical matron, who
is haunted by fears of What the Butler Saw.
As the former lover of this furious lady (and
would-be murderess), Jekyll gets no credit
from the devotion of his tall, blind wife
(•Miss Baird), who walks around the pre-
mises, feeling for him with outstretched
hands. Moreover, any pathetic interest that
the tall, blind wife excites is discounted by
a suspicion that she also is superhuman.
When she has returned home unexpectedly,
she appears at an upstairs doorway, and
asks somebody to go out and pay the cab-
man, which suggests that she must have
flown in at a first-floor window. But this
is a mere detail of the Jekyll portion of the
drama. The plot is mostly supplied by the
doctor’s other self —Mr. Hyde. Hyde is the
quintessence of iniquity in a long ulster, and
restless as -a hyena in a cage. Having dis-
posed of Lady Carew’s inconvenient hus-
band by springing on his back and choking
him, the monster hops round to the lodgings
of the butler aforementioned, and kills him
also. After which he makes painful en-
deavors to resume the personality of Jekyll
in the presence of the latter’s respectable
friend, Dr. Lanyon. The result of this psy-
chological outrage to Lanyon’s feelings _is
sudden death, and, when the police arrive
to arrest Hyde, they find a feeble reincarna-
tion of Jekyll weeping for Lanyon’s decease.
Finally, Jekyll resumes the serio-comic
identity of Hyde, and can’t escape from it
until he has breathed his last with his back
to the audience. Then his friends Toll him
on to his right side, facing the orchestra,
and he turns out to be Jekyll once again.
* * * *
H. B. Irving’s two characters are alleged,
on several occasions, to have different voices,
but, as a matter of fact, there is not enough
difference of intonation to deceive anybody
—not even the poor blind wife. Otherwise,
this pair of quick-change character imper-
sonations is entitled to precedence ( of Le-
surques and Duboscq in the actor s lurid
repertoire. His performance is quite worthy
of tne drama, anyhow, and his leap on to
the back of the doomed baronet shows
marked agility. Arthur Whitby, as the
cynical-Sir Danvers Carew, has some telling
lines to exercise his distinctive elocution
upon; Miss Brown expresses the sinfulness
of Lady C. by all means that are legiti-
mate only in red-hot melodrama, and numer-
ous male members of the co. constitute social
gatherings, and wear stripes on their dress
pants. The Hyde-bound Jekyll will be Irv-
ing’s last character at Her Majesty s. Un
Saturday, he goes to the Royal to revne
“The Lyons Mail,” for five farewell nights.
“The Mail” is a light and breezy entertain-
ment compared with the other doings of the
co., and Melbourne will take the revival
very kindly. , *
Is it necessary to mention that the_season
of Grand Onera at Her Majesty s will start
next Saturday? Melba is advertised to open
the musical proceedings in person, as• tne
heroine of “La Traviata,” and to sipg three
times in the following week, w hen »amson
and Delilah,” “Butterfly’ and . Hoh&me
will introduce nearly all the principals ot
the co. to Melbourne notice.
“The Midnight Wedding,” which hap-
pened to Melbourne at the Royal four years
ago, has fallen into the hands of the Ander
son co. at the King’s, where an eccent •
German princess made her first marr e
with the sword-master of the Red Hussars
last Saturday. A brisk and
is “T.M.W.,” paved with reminiscences ot
old decorative melodramas, and claimm
kinship with “The Prince and .the Beggar
Maid.” Its military discipline is' Strangely
lax, and its Court etiquette takes the scone,
but its morals are above suspicion.

the inevitable bedroom scene is untar-
nished by the breath of calumny. In ordin-
ary melodramas of common life, a ruthless,
sordid villain comes to a vulgar end, as a
rule. In this blue-blooded fiction, the prin-
cipal misdemeanant has a proud air of mili-
tary distinction, and he achieves a soldier’s
death from the thrust of a master swords-
man. Roy Redgrave and Beckett are rival
claimants for Miss Duggan’s royal smile,
Max Clifton and Crown Prince Edmund
Duggan are related to the lady. J. H. Nunn
is the priest who marries her to Redgrave
at midnight, and Bailey and Harrison are
tne comic-relief tommies who pay monoton-
ous addresses to Miss Erris. Also, Miss
Wilton figures conspicuously as a tempest-
uous lady wh<pse alias is “Satanella ” Fur-
ther explanation of her character is need-
less.

At the Princess’s the nice girl with a sweet
post-nasal voice will succumb to temptation
for yet another week. Large audiences are
making due allowances for the Girl. Hav-
ing promised to refrain from marrying
George Cross, her love for him is practically
incurable. She can’t speak of him without
stating how much she loves him. And the
applause of the multitude encourages her in
her passion. Her honesty and candor remind
one of an early cabbage laying bare its fresh
young heart.

At Melbourne Town Hall the robustious
voice of Ben Davies was to be heard for the
last time on Tuesday of this week. Four
concerts were not enough to supply a grow-
ing demand for Davies-D’Argo song, so an
extra one, with a programme of ballads
only, was added before the co. set out for
Ballarat, Bendigo and elsewhere.
“Zigomar,” freely adapted from a yarn
by Leon Sazie, lately gave the population at
West’s, Melbourne, some enjoyable thrills.
The film, deDicting the struggle between a
first-class bandit and a great detective, in-
cluded some convincing glimpses of the Mou-
lin Rouge, and other Methodist haunts. “The
Thief,” another recent feature at West’s,
led up to the becoming end of a reformed
lady larcenist; and “Scenes in Provence”
showed some interesting bits of Orange,
Avignon, and the famous ex-residence of
the Popes.
In the allegeu tragedy, “Duty and
Honor,” at the Prahran Lyric (Vic.), the
chief sufferer is the Seventh Commandment,
which gets severely fractured. “Nobody
Loves Fat Women” contains farce, fury and
a very wide ladv ; and the item anent “The

looking» fish upon the screen. The animals

Wirths’ Circus, in its Handsome new build-
ing at the “Park,” Melbourne, provides a
collection of turns that probably enlivened
I’haraoh’s leisure moments. The same old
jockeys prance on the rumps of rushing
steeds, and semi-savage beasts continue to
reveal’ the long-familiar secrets of their edu-
cation The clown, however, seems to have
been killed in though there is
still a little fooling by a vigorous youth
with a setting-sun complexion. Un the seri-
ous side of the show, the finest act is that
of the Flying Jordans, who. perform aerial
journeys and twirl and tumble in the ascend-
ing breath of the congregation. Miss Dagmar
introduces her well-washed dogs ; and Kitchen
and Foy, and the Frantzes, who are seven,
also throng the bill. In the animal world
there are the lions, tigers and Polar bears,
besides Toby, the elephant, and his dainty
relations. On Saturday the caged lion pro-
duced some exciting, unrehearsed effects in
controversy with its trainer, and the profes-
sor who was to have put the Polar bears
through their drill was unfortunately unable
to be present, on account of his having
been invalided —by a peevish elephant, it
was said.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“G. 8.”: “0.K.” (B. 19/10/T1) savs it was not
until 1885 that Harry Rickards ran his own variety
show in Australia. I enter a protest. Harry
Rickards had his own show in Australia so far
back as 1872. t I saw it at the Apollo Hall, Mel-
bourne, in 1873. and at the St. George’s Hall of that
city in the following year, and later also at the
White Rooms, Adelaide. At a slightly later period
Harry toured the other States and the country
districts. He left suddenly, and did not return till
the date mentioned by 0.K.”
“Harrison O.” : Without wishing to sling clods or
rocks at a capable Australian artist, I would admire
to know \yffen the musical critics of our great dailies
are going to cease writing lofty prophecies anent
Amy Castles. When, in 1899, the buxon songstress,
then a girl of 17, warbled before the Brasseys at
the Austral Salon, certain daily paper critics went
on a musical maffick. Twelve years have elapsed
since then, and the judicious know that those prog-
nostications are still some distance away from being
realised. But the daily press still insists upon sus-
taining the role of prophet, in which, in connection
with art, politics and everything else, it has been
such conspicuous and ghastly failures. In its notice
of Amy’s farewell performance, at Melbourne Town
Hall, the other night, the Age observed: “The young
Australian prima donna closed a phase in her career
under happy conditions, auguring even greater things
in the future. If she throws herself without re-
straint into conquering not a few, but all the
problems of her art, she should go far, even perhaps
to significant achievements in grand opera.” Which
< speaking- from memory) is almost precisely what
the same paper said in 1899. Those who have fol-
lowed the career of the clever Bendigo girleen must
by now realise that the songstress has travelled prac-
tically as far as she is likely to, in a musical
manner of speakmg. I was forced to the conclu-
sion, during the last Williamson grand opera season
in Melbourne, that the Castles voice and the Castles
temperament are not Of the type required by a
world-awakening operatic star. Amy is a fine con-
cert singer, with a fair notion of stage effects, and
would probably be better if she worked harder;
but that is all.
Miss!May Summerbelle, one of Sydney’s small com-
munity of presswomen, whose “Blue Pacific” march
was highly commended by Sousa, and played by his
band in the Town Hall, has been receiving the con-
gratulations of Antonia Dolores on some of her
song compositions. Dolores says that the Sydney
musician has “the gift of melody,” and Dolores
ought to know.
“Silas Snell”: A marked peculiarity of H. B.
Irving’s manner or mannerism is that he conveys an
idea that his subject is more or less drunk. There
were moments when Hamlet was as tight as a
bottle. This suggests a new and most fruitful theme
for the Shakspearian societies —“Was Hamlet
drunk ?” Judging by the Irving interpretation, I
am of opinion that the Prince of Denmark was a
confirmed Jimmy Woodser, whose troubles were
largely due to secret nipping.
“Stargazer”: The two comedy objects in Red-
grave’s version of “The Sorrows of Satan” are
daily-paper pressmen whose conversation is as fatu-
ous as their conduct, and that is imbecile when it
isn’t worse. They steal the Devil’s whisky, and
one of them beats his sick and starving wife in
the street, while the other looks on in placid enjoy-
ment of the scrap. These characters are skull-
dragged into the drama, with the apparent inten-
tion of gratifying the press gang, who have to de-
vote so much energy and so many adjectives to
the task of misleading the people with regard to
bad plays and worse players. By reading the daily
papers of to-day, you will learn that dramas are
never execrable, and actors no longer stupid and
doll : by attending the theatres regularly, you will
discover that the reporter is almost always a
drunkard and a boor. I cannot recall a single in-
stance, - in 20 years, of a pressman in a play who
is treated with respect. So the soft report turneth
away wrath !
Sydney, by this time, is quite ready to endorse the
dictum of Oscar Hammerstein, the chief engineer of
grand opera in New York. Hammerstein is building
a magnificent opera house in London, as big as the
old Covent Garden Theatre, on the strength of his
New York experiences. He lost money there for a
long time, but eventually he made grand opera pay,
and now he declares that Verdi, Wagner, Gounod,
Puccini, and the rest of them can be profitably pro-
duced, like Shakspeare, in any big city. A high-
class operatic venture generates a taste for music.
The taste spreads, and becomes a craving.
George Stephenson, who has just returned from
Maoriland with his company, “The Wanderers,” and
10 sacks of coin, has engaged “Sahib” Liddiard’s
juvenile pantomime co. to play “The Old Womgn
Who Lived in a Shoe” through the western circuit
of N. S. Wales.
“Nym”: Noel Flemming, the burly tenor cast for
the swaggering character in “The Chocolate Sol-
dier,” gets his appearance and mannerisms from his
father, Barton McGuckin, the popular Irish tenor of
long ago. McGuckin, in the late autumn of his
career, when his voice had been worn threadbare by
singing Wagnerian hero parts six nights a week, on
long tours, came to Australia with Amy Sherwin,
and revealed his chronic hoarseness on the concert
platform. The Bulletin, at the time, published
some of the yarns he told against himself on the
subject of his unfortunate nose. Once, when he was
playing Lohengrin in Dublin, a couple of medical
students were talking of him in his godlike capacity,
and the younger critic said: “Barton’s all right; but
I can’t get over his nose.” The other fellow, quite
unconscious of McGuckin being at his elbow, replied:
“How the devil could you "•et over a nose like that!
There’s no bridge to it.” Noel Flemming’s face
brings the ancient anecdote back to memory.
“Vaudevillain”: Very many years ago it used to
be said that Rickards- —Leete by name—was a plum-
ber, and worked on the Sydenham Crystal Palace.
Hearing comiques, he felt like Correggio, who gained
upon a work by Michael Angelo, and exclaimed, “I,
too, am a painter!” I thought he was more than 66.
He came to Australia in 1872—39 years ago—and
even then was in London’s first line. His portraits,
with the spiky moustache, were familiar on the
music-sheets. Got as many original songs as his
rivals Laybourne, the great Vance, Harry Clifton and
“Perfect Cure” Stead. Rickards first appeared in
Australia with his little company, including Carrie
Rickards, Lizzie Watson and tenor ltamsden, who
had been in Lyster’s chorus. Lizzie married Henry
Braham. I suppose Rickards’s best stars, in alpha-
betical order, not to be invidious, were the Arabs,
Biondi, Burns, Chirgwin, Cinquevalli, Lottie Collins,
Godfrey, Johnson, the Kremos, Lamberti, Lee, Leroy,
Marie Lloyd, “Turpin” Roberts, Soo, Tich and Win-
ton. Rickards was married, about 35 years ago, in
England, to Lottie d’Aste, the gymnast. She had
previously been a furore in Melbourne, performing
with her brother Frank and her husband Victor. He
was drowned while bathing in Victoria. E. C. Moore
imported the Lottie troupe. He was afterwards the
first secretary of the Victorian Amateur Turf Club,
preceding Bond and Smith. Moore complained once
at the Age office. Said he: “There were about 120
pressmen at my show last night, and their united
efforts resulted in six lines altogether in’.all the
papers.” After Lottie’s death Rickards married Miss
Katie, who became the mother of his two daughters.
“Tromboney”: Latter-day ravings of Prof. Mar-
shall-Hall on behalf of the Williamsonian operatic pro-
ductions, are most irritating to those Melbourne people
who remember Hall as a volcano of German musical
doctrines, belching scorn and ridicule at the very
class of entertainment which he now barracks for.
The Prof, exhorted his disciples to close their ears
to the “meaningless” melodi.es of “lollypop” com-
posers, charmed they never so sweetly. Antagonism
to “tuneful” opera was never more pronounced than
when a fine Italian co. came to Melbourne (firstly)
under Williamsonian auspices. Local criticism blew
icy cold on that well-organised Italian company, and
there were no thunderous bravos from Marshall-Hall,
The cult looked down on Dani, Larizza, Sapio, Bas-
sieh, Benedetto, Bozzoli, and the rest of them from
a lofty eminence, and smiled at the simjplicity of
the poor, ignorant music-lovers who thought they
were getting a treat. And then, after long years,
came the amazing spectacle of Marshall-Hall roaring
unqualified delight over the performance of —Bel
Sorel in “Madame Butterfly” ! Barracking for
saccharine Italian music, and sitting entranced by a
performance of “La Boheme,” which was not a patch
on what the big Italian co. had given nine years
earlier! After that, his recent outbreaks of en-
thusiasm for the Melba co. were accepted as a
matter of course. Melba opens the season in “Tra-
viata,” an old-fashioned work, the sweetness whereof
would formerly have stirred up the Professor’s Teu-
tonic bile, yet he can hardly find adjectives to Com-
mend the art, the charm, the glory of the co.’s forth-
coming performances to Melbourne notice. Ap-
parently the Soul of Music is ascetic only until it
gets to middle age. Then it cuts a sweet tooth, and
acquires a taste for lollypops and jewellery. The
eyes that one time glared defiance at all pomps and
vanities of warble-culture find delight in gazing
through glasses at “the lustrous pearls of Melba’s
voice.” Thus, the whirligig of time brings its re-
venges. and the golden eagie comes down from his
little perch.
EDWARD GOLL,
PIANIST ;
WITH THE
BEN DAVIES
SHOW.
The Maori Village, which that sharp Tittle lady,
Maggie Papakura, some months agp dumped down
at Clontarf, Sydney, while awaiting a steamer to
convey the tribe and the kuri and the fleas and the
lavender to George V.’s Coronation jamboree, is
coming home without a fortune. In fact, from ad-
vance letters, it is hanging on to its return ticket
with claws and teeth, fearing that if it loses the
paper it will have to walk, stow away or swim back.
The syndicate (mostly Sydney men) which financed
the venture, is estimated to have dropped about
£9OOO. Maggie will be in Sydney to explain things
before carting the village back to its native swamp
in December.
“S.T.S.”: Prophecy is a poor game, yet I want to
differ from “Cassandra” (B. 21/9/’ll) about the
prospects of the moving-picture show. The film-
shop is different from the cyclorama or the rink.
It is not, I think, a mere trick of the moment’s
fashion, but appeals to a great, and growing, public
want. Formerly, people were either educated, or
not. To-day, the vast majority are about i, or
.333, educated, and they want something that will
amuse, or tickle the emotions, with some slight
appearance of intelligence, without by any chance
making them think. The cheap, illustrated maga-
zine—entirely a growth of the last 20 years—fills
the bill. (Is that going to have an “imperishable
slump”?) So does the moving-picture. Its brief,
brisk appeal to the eye is only an improved form
of a movement you see everywhere. Pictures are in
even the daily papers. They are in schools; prob-
ably moving ones will be there too before long.
To succeed anywhere you must catch the at-
tention. Wells’s idea of the newspaper of
the future is a great phonograph, which
will bellow out, say, “Deakin is the man
we want; not Fisher. Deakin is a Strong Man”—
bellow it over and over again till the syllables take
possession of the brain, and are stored away uncon-
seiously for future guidance. Get the film and
the phonograph together, and you have a tremen-
dously strong weapon with the non-thinking majority.
But while films should have a big future, that is
not to deny that in some towns competition may
be carried to insane lengths. Still, the success of
the pictures won’t kill the Cassandras. They are
immortal. From 250 to 300 years ago, they were
busy saying that every Right-Thinking Person must
always continue to drink beer for breakfast, and
that this new-fangled habit of taking the drugs
called tea or coffee must shorly slump. But it didn’t.
[Exactly. Some 300 years ago some people said
beer for breakfast was permanent. Now some people
say picture-shows are permanent.— Ed. B.].
“Harrison O.”: Having viewed Gregan McMahon’s
production of “The Voysey Inheritance,” I have
come to the conclusion that the only thing neces-
sary for Granville Barker and his satellites to do, if
they desire to acquire a fair measure of. popularity,
is to learn the art of playwriting. Of course il
may be that their pleasing egotism prevents them
from desiring popularity. It is the quaint de-
lusion of certain members of the Court Theatre
coterie that they have messages to deliver, but the
public can’t understand them ; whereas the real
trouble is that the literary flunkeys of the Court do
not know enough of the art of the dramatist to em-
body their messages, or whatever they choose to call
them, in decent dramatic form. In “The Voysey In-
heritance” Barker shows not the slightest considera-
tion for either audience or actors. He has written
five acts of talk. The play is almost destitute of
action, and the occasional flashes of Cleverness in
the dialogue do not compensate for its general dull-
ness. Shaw would have packed the tale with clever
paradoxes. Pinero would have made the plot in-
tensely dramatic. Barker does neither. When a
bloke sets out to write a play or a poem there are
certain fixed rules which, unless he is a transcendent
genius, he cannot afford to ignore. A minor poet
who plays ducks and drakes with the laws of pro-
sody must be prenared for critical disrespect. Gran-
ville Barker has mistaken his thin jet of talent for
genius, and thinks that he can, in consequence, over-
look the rules of the game. He may be a lot of the
things his admirers claim for him, but, judged on
“The Voysey Inheritance,” he is not. a playwright.
“S.”: There is a haunting sameness about the im-
personations of Miss Dorothea Baird. I watched her
first as Ophelia, and I am sure that she never put
away her Ophelian gestures in playing Mary Cave
in “A Maid of Honor” and the girl Jeanette in “The
Lyons Mail,” The two latter characters also used
much of Ophelia’s deportment, while the whole lot
wore faces of speechless pain. How odd is Miss
Baird’s settled expression of suffering. Sometimes
it looks quite sculpturesque, and you wonder whether
she puts it on hot and allows it to grow cold and
harden.
The newest Glory Quayle in England is Mary Mar-
lowe, an Australian girl, who got her training with
Julius Knight. She was, at latest, in Liverpool,
with Hall Caine’s son, Derwent, as the stodgy,
stdrmy John.
“Stargazer”: I-larry Rickards’s age was given at
66. lam not so far off 50 as I would like to be, but
“’Arry” is one of my earliest theatrical recollec-
tions. It is quite 40 years since I saw him first, and
then he was a fierce lion comique, his upper lip
clothed with thunder. “ ’Arry” looked 40 then,
mainly by reason of that terrific black moustache.
He burst upon me at the old Miners’ Racecourse at
Ballarat, where for a few moments he was the centre
of delirious public interest by reason of the fact
that one strenuous young woman was making a
dramatic attempt to horsewhip another on his ac-
count. Later, in Melbourne, Rickards and Dr. £ £
Smith, who had a local reputation as a Methuselah,
were credited with being the youngest men on earth
for their years. I once heard the supposed imperish-
able Smith reply to some banter about his age:
“You think me old. What about Rickards here?
He used to make love to my nurse.”
Francis Suttor, President of the Ma
State's Legislative Council, lost his wife by
death last week. Though the lady married a
politician, she came from a home whose
head, Thomas Jarman Hawkins, touched
politics only once, and then, after six
months’ trial, dropped the business as though
it were charged with sizzling dynamite. That
was in 1800, and Hawkins’s sudden resigna-
tion gave Daniel Deneiliey the chance of a
seat. Pa Hawkins was, like the Suttors, a
pioneer of “the West,” as semi-suburban
Bathurst is still called in Sydney.
The S. M. Herald on the subject of wire-
netting :
It is singular that, in spite of the large amount
of capital which has been sunk in the indftstry, and
the number of men who find permanent employ nunc
thereby, no Government has of late years seen fit to
give any substantial support to it. When the Com-
monwealth tariff was being passed through Parlia-
ment, an attempt was made to obtain some little
protection as a set-off against the low rate of wages
paid in other countries, where wire-netting is pro-
duced. But the effort was without avail.
And remember how the S. M. Herald
fought and struggled for the duty, and day
by day recalled the “low rate of wages paid
in other countries,” and urged the need of
a set-off against that handicap ! And re-
member, too, how the S. M. Herald told the
Government not to bother about the bloated
squatter, and to utterly disregard his yelp !
The thought that it has fought all these
battles on behalf of High Protection, and
lost, must give the Herald great pain—es-
pecially when it sees the industries wilting,
and some unborn manufacturers’ advts. lost.

To give a trifling foolish show;
Ridiculous enough; ’tWould “go,”

A princely screw, I mostly yearn
To earn a “nom-de-frivol!”
Base is the slave who’s bound to Art!
He also serves who plays a part
Outrageously absurd. I’ll start
To steep myself in drivel.
With reddened nose and roomy pants,
The limit of extravagance,
I’ll take—oh, blissful circumstance —
A crack-jaw “nom-de-frivol,”
And then bound on the Rickards stage,
The “button-buster” of the age!
Let serious-minded mimes engage
To make the gall’ry snivel!
Of fun the “gods” must have their fill —
I’ll gladly- fool for them until
The staring top-line of the bill
Is mine, my “nom-de-frivol!”

The call for new offices for the Public In-
struction Department, in Sydney, threatens
the ancient fig tree which now stands, well
grown and flourishing, in front of the
present offices. The vegetable must be at
least 90 years old. The building at the
rear of it was erected in the middle ’teens
of last century, when Macquarie was Gov-
ernor. It was for many years the head-
quarters of the official life of all Australia,
and from there Macleay and other old-time
Imperial Colonial Secretaries issued their
autocratic orders. When the new offices in
Macquarie-street were erected, the old place
was given over to the Public Instruction De-
partment. The building that still remains
was one of a group of three, and

was originally the Colonial Secretary’s
residence and official quarters. The
one next it, in the centre, was the
residence of the chaplain; and the third
or most westerly, where the Lands offices
are now, was the residence of Chief Justice
Francis Forbes. The centre one was the
first to be demolished. The westerly one be-
came the Lands offices, and the eastern the
offices of the Chief Secretary.
A Victorian man has bought the remains of
the aged steamer Despatch, wrecked at Lakes
Entrance in September, for £5. His prop-
erty is 50ft. under water, and, if his diver
finds nothing but the empty sea floor when
he goes down, the oldest inhabitant won’t
be surprised. The quicksands at the En-
trance are very voracious, and are known to
have rapidly swallowed three other vessels.
They nearly got the Despatch once before,
when it was lying partly submerged on a
bank, after colliding with the pier. By
this, time, with eight fathoms of water above
it. it must be a buried ship. The people
of the Lakes at the time of the accident
reckoned the burial would be completed in
about, a week, and now the funeral has been
dragging along for a month or so. Only six
people attended the auctioneer’s little post-
mortem ; and when the intrepid buyer said
£5. the hammer fell on the bid amidst a dead
silence. Nobody else wanted the entombed.

A week or so back, a North Coast
(N.S.W.) skipper who had just hauled his
packet over the Crookhaven bar, asked,
through his company, that the usual dredge
be sent wallowing up the coast to labori-
ously clean the entrance a bit. The little
coasters seem to spend half their time get-
ting on and oft’ sandbanks, and the conse-
quent straining and bumping must impair
their constitutions. The lost Itosedale is
said to have sat down card and often on the
obstacles which are patiently built up again
by D. Jones when the expensive dredge has
waddled off to another job. It is an inter-
minable business, which is wearing alike on
shipowners, captains, boats, dredges and the
successive individuals who take up the
Works portfolio. ’That carry-all is said to be
the heaviest in the Ministry—due to its wad
of ancient and modern I O U’s, and about a
cubic mile of ban harbor sand.
“Optic” : lie the promise ot the Australian
Government, in view of recdnt marine dis-
asters, to turn its expert on to the N.S.W.
coast, and report whether it is sufficiently
lighted, I would point out a curious fact.
There are mare accidents along a well-
lighted piece of coast-line than elsewhere.
The Ly-ee-moon was lost, with SO lives, just
under Green /Jape lighthouse. The Eagle
hurled itself at the rocks under the same
light. The Australia ran on to Port Phillip
heads with the danger sector of the Point
Nepean light full on it. The Coraki, a few
years back, butted on to Little Seal rock,
where there is a special flaming warning.
The Macleay went to smithereens in the full
glare of the Port Stephens illumination.
Perhaps an earnest inquiry into the number
of hours worked by officers might be valu-
able. I have a theory that if three or four
more lighthouses were added to the pay, and
about half a dozen beacons deducted from
the hours, the N.S.W. coast would be a very
fairly illuminated place.

The picturesque Tasmanian settlement of
Queenstown is fast vanishing off the census
records, by reason of the Mount Lyell strike.
It lives on Mount Lyell, and now that Lyell
is practically closed, the dinky little railway
can hardly carry the people who want to get
away. As a side issue, the trouble is one
more commentary on the utter unreliability
of Hague tribunals, and such-like pacific
agencies! Senator Long tried to make peace
by sugsfesting that either Justice Higgins,
known to all as a good democrat, or J. C.
Watson, the first Federal Labor Prime Min-
ister, should be appointed to judge the dis-
pute. The men refused flatly, though they
•couldn’t possibly have got a better-disposed ai-
bitrator ; and it wasn’t considered worth while
approaching the co. after that. Which is
only another evidence that nations and in-
dividuals don’t arbitrate any more than tney
diu 1000 years ago, over what they regard
as essentials.

clamor quite as loudly against the importa-
tion of bishops, astronomers, school-masters,
school-inspectors, etc., as they do against
the importation of artisans. But the Labor
Ministry should do more—it should preach
and practise the doctrine of preference for
Australians in the filling of Australian posi-
tions. In this way, Australian Labor Cab-
inets could do very much to foster a belief
in, and a pride in, the capabilities of
Australians. About a year ago the
N. S. Wales Labor Government had a
finp chance of putting a virile Big
Australian on the Public Service Board;
but it was afraid of offending its
"Liberal” friends, and of annoying the
Herald and Telegraph. Nevertheless,
when the Public Service Board is reorgan-
ised—that is, if the State Labor Cabinet is
game to tackle the job—an ardent Austra-
lian. with a firm faith in Australians, should
be given control.
The case of Dr. Peacock, the very old
gentleman who is being tried in Melbourne
for the alleged murder of a dead bodv that
can’t be found, brought to light a_ frank and
beaming witness. A sample of his evidence
follows: —-
Counsel asked i-A
Did you say you would "tell any lie" to save your-
self ?—Yes.
That is your present position, I presume?—Yes.
Have you been out of work lately?—Yes. The
police have been- paving me 355. a week since August
The police prevented you getting a job, so that
they could keep an eye on you?—Yes.
Then they did not place much reliance on you?—
I suppose not. ■ ?
Have you been living at McKenzie-street, near the
Russell-street barracks ? —Yes.
Have you been under special surveillance, a con-
stable being told off to be your comnanion, day and
night ? —Yes. I have not been supplied with a copy
of my previous evidence, but, I have read it in the
newspapers occasionally.
What for? Because you were proud of your feat?
—Yes.
Is that trye, or is it a glib lie?—lt was not true.
Then you; are lying now, deliberately ?—No, not
deliberately.,
Perhaps you cannot help it?—Yes, I can.
There is a pleasant flavor about the wit-
ness’s indignant assurance that he could
help it.
Victoria has discovered the importunate
woman mentioned in the Scriptures. Her
name is Margaret Schiffmann, and, it seems,
she was convicted away back in April, 1910,
at Port Melbourne, on three charges of pos-
sessing certain goods suspected of having
been stolen, and was sentenced to one, two
and three months respectively. She ap-
pealed against the first conviction, and her
view was upheld by Justice Box, who, how-
ever, stated a case at the request of the
State. The argument was heard by Justice
Hodges, who also supported Margaret’s
view. Next, she alleged that the State had
agreed to take the first appeal as a test
for all three; but, as the State denied this,
she appealed some more. Judge Neighbour
heard the second and third appeals. He re-
duced the penalty in the third case to a fine
of £5, and let the second stand as it was.
After the second appeal, Margaret started
doing her two months ; but, during the hear-
ing of the third appeal, a few weeks later,
Judge Neighbour said that had he known all
the facts of the second case he would have
reduced the penalty, and he recommended
Margaret to apply immediately for a remis-
sion of sentence. She did so, and the State,
alios Attorney-General J. Dry Brown, agreed
to remit the month still owing, so to speak,
on her binding herself for the next 15 years
to abstain from using alcohol, frequenting
hotels, associating with persons of ill re-
pute, or going to places of public resortfpre-
sumably churches), and a few other things.
As Judge Neighbour had recommended the re-
mission of tne rest of the sentence —which
he had only confirmed on appeal because he
was ignorant of all the facts —Margaret
curtly refused this magnanimous offer of the
State; also she paid the £5 fine. That
was in July, 1910, and for most of the
time since she seems to have been trying to
get Judge Neighbour to state a case so that
she might get the convictions quashed, and
her slate wiped clean. Last June the Judge
definitely refused to oblige the lady, and now
Justice Hood has refused a mandamus to
compel him to do it, so Margaret is appar-
ently blocked, unless she commutes with the
Pull Court on the subject. It is a fearfully
gradual, deliberate business altogether, and
seeing that the two months hafe gone, and can
in no way be recovered, any' more than the
Spanish galleon San Gregorio w.gs able to re-
cover the day it lost as mentioned in Bret
Ilarte’s poem, this paper has doubts whether
the game is worth the candle. But it per-
ceives that Margaret Schiffmann is a per-
sistent woman, and there is no telling what
that sort of lady may arrive at yet.
FORM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When the racing Saturnalia’s fairly started,
And I find my own excitement growing warm,
My friends all bid me not be chicken-hearted,
But to back the noble party known as Form.
So I keep my ancient race-books, never caring
For the horrible reminders they contain,
And you’ll find me by the midnight oil comparing
How This and That make one conclusion plain.
There’s Didus, who was beaten flat in Sydney—
Catastrophe which struck admirers dumb :
But Caulfield showed him quite another kidney ;
It must have been, some cause we cannot plumb !
Then “Mr. Green s fine black” (as writers call him)
Is often classed among the Might-Have-Been,
And makes me ponder, while I overhaul him,
The rancid revelations of Levien.
1 hear the books cry “Aureofodinia”
(They’ll maul a name whenever there’s a chance),
And marvel while I puff my mild Virginia,
Why Form so oft should yield to Circumstance.
And just when I have brought four-furlong flutters
Down to a science, pedigreed and fair,
Then Golden Gauntlet comes along, and utters
Her challenge to invincible Traquair.
Nay, shall we blame the owner or the rider,
Or blame the horse himself for all our doubt?
I know not, but I hate the swift outsider,
Who makes the spring-time racing “in-and-out.”
The Dead, which have amazing resurrections ;
The Favorites, which die around the turn—
To both of these I have sincere objections,
Because they make the Game so hard to learn.
To choose devices feminine and funny,
To prick the likely winner with a pin,
To put your quid behind “the weight of money,”
These be the ways in which the mugs may win.
Thus may I find my breeches pockets bulging,
When unto me the golden coins shall swarm ;
But I have ceased to hope for Fate’s divulging
That pale elusive phantom known as Form.

One of the solid reasons why hospitals
should be wholly—and liberally—supported
by the State is “Egg Day.” “Egg Day” is
a living evidence of the unreliability of pri-
vate charity—of its ups and downs, its sud-
den jumps, its fits and starts, its leaps and
sinkages and hysterics. A few weeks ago
there was no such thing as “Egg Day.” Then
some one, in some place or another, struck
the idea x of having a weekly collection of
eggs for the local hospital. (In some very
hot regions eggs don’t keep for a week, but
that is a small detail.) The craze spread,
especially in Victoria. All the people who
sprint after a new idea, and then get tired,
became raving eggists. Warrnambool is a
small place with a populat'on of about 6500
people, so its hospital population isn’t likely
to be m’ore than a dozen or two or three. Yet
on a recent weekly “Egg Day,” it put up
3300 hen fruit. One school at Footscray
contributed 2148 eggs in a single day. While
the gpasm lasts it seems to be a fixed con-
victiop; that hospital patients eat nothing
but eggs ; that they consume 20 eggs a day
each; •that they have egg all over their coun-
tenances as a steady thing; and that eggs
are to them roof, clothing, bedding, litera-
ture, and spiritual consolation. The egg
mania will die out, of course, and possibly it
will be succeeded by a pumpkin mania, or a
beljtppper rush, or a tart frenzy. The moral
is that charity is too sudden. A hos-
pital patient wants regular feeding—not 24
eggs on Monday, six large watermelons
on Tuesday, and a bouquet on Wednes-
day. That is where the advantages of
steady-going State management come in.
The Treasury has no Egg Days.

Away back in the dusty past, before the
Australian capital had been fixed at Y’ass-
berra, and the Sydney Telegraph’s fish cor-
respondent had thoughtlessly dried up the
beautiful Cotter water-supply story by
describing the allegedly never-failing torrent
as a series of waterholes, some great thinker
crawled out of a tent and supported the
claim of ’Berra to be the capital of a con-
tinent, on the ground that there was plenty
of game in its vicinity. He plainly expected
the kangaroo to hop round amongst the
traffic, and the ’possum to clamber up the
fapade of Federal Parliament House; also,
in his day dream, he could see the metro-
politan trout rising underneath the busy,
rumbling bridges, and the city clerks putting
in their lunch time angling. Everything
wild and edible was expected to stay on and
breed and provide amusement and nourish-
ment for a large population. He forgot that
Nature hops, flutters, scurries and swims
from ferry boats, electric trams, German
bands, newsboys, and other disturbances of
civilisation. This painful fact came to the
surface of things lately, when a Sydney
fishmonger told the Food Commission that,
in these days of congestion, he had to pay
Is. _Bd. per lb. for schnapper that used to be
procurable for 3d. and 4d. when there was
less shipping passing in and out of Port
dackson. The schnapper and his friends
live far from Circular Quay now, and, by
the time they are laid out on the house-
holder’s table, cost lust about five times as
much as they did before the place became so
painfully bloated.
THE ART OF ADVERTISING.
RIDICULOUS!
THE NEAREST SUFFERER (stung at length to rebellion): “I say, Mister, that bipe o' yours
does hum, an’ not error."
THE OLD 'UN (astdtinded): “It earn't! It's a nao pipe. .Why, it's only a matter o'
fifteen years since I bought it."
Melbourne Age lately discovered
that the public is paying Is. sd. per
cwt. for its “box blocks,” and that it
hasn’t paid less than Is. per cwt.
these many years; also, that the up-
country firewood-cutters, mostly small
sawmillers, receive for that same fuel,
after cutting, sawing, splitting, cart-
ing and loading it, as little as 3s. per
ton, or a trifle under 2d. per cwt.. and
the paper observes that there is a
discrepancy. There is! The Age
states that the firewood merchants
blame the millers, but that the latter
disencumber themselves of the onus by
producing their account sales; so it
proposes a remedy: “It is necessary
for the rural workers to discuss their
interests with each other, and to form
some sort of agreement.” As a piece
of whole-hog snuffle, that is the limit.
The hapless wood-cutters, who are
scattered over the least accessible
spots in the backblocks, and don’t
know each other, are to “form some
sort of agreement.” Not a word about
joining the Rural Workers’ Union,
and so getting in touch with well-in-
formed organisers who can bring them
together; not a line about the plun-
dered public out of whose pockets the
merchants are filching nearly a shil-
ling on every cwt. of wood they sell;
and not a syllable about asking Par-
liament to deal with a combine whose
profits are mainly the result of a “horrible
understanding.” The wood-cutters are ad-
vised to “come to some sort of agreement
among themselves”- —and that is all!
In spite of the £lOO penalty on ship-
masters. the undesirable Chow tar is still
bolting from the gallant British vessels that
employ him, and carving a home for himself,
and a (probably) white girl and mongrel
family, in the middle of our White Australia.
One recent week, in Sydney alone. £9OO were
collected in fines, which is about the most
unsatisfactory revenue that could be ob-
tained. The tramp Camphill lost four Pongs
frpin its crew, and was just feeling its way
olit of Port Jackson when a Customs officer
climbed aboard and diagnosed the case as
one of insufficient Chow. It was a very in-
furiated skipper who left a chenue for £4OO
with his agents to satisfy the Customs gen-
tleman ; but probably his language will be
as nothing to that of the bluff, old John Bull
owners when they get the news and the bill.
Melbourne Benevolent Asylum has just
got about £lOOO that it didn’t expect—until
lately. Away back in 1827, one Bridgman
Ilewitson died in the Cold Land and left a
little property, the interest on one-fourth of
which went to certain beneficiaries during
their lives, after which the principal was
devised to the 12 children of one. Trentham
Old. One of these children, Juliana, married
George Lanman, and had a son, George
Herbert. She subsequently became insane,
and died so, in 1867. Before her death,
however, her husband had departed for Aus-
tralia, leaving son George Herbert behind.
Somewhere about this stage, the moneys of
deceased Hewitson became available to the
children of Trentham Old, and when Juliana
died, Lanman naturally inherited; but as
he continued in this uncivilised land, and
nobody seemed to know exactly where he
was or how to find him, the trustees con-
tinued to invest his share, together with com-
pound interest, till it grew to be a tidy sum.
Towards the close of last century the sur-
viving trustee, however, grew tired, and
handed the money into Chancery. Mean-
while, in the late ’Bo’s, Lanman had sought
refuge in the Melbourne Benevolent Asy-
lum, where he died in 1898, leaving a will
giving all he possessed to the institution.
When his name appeared in the Chancery
list, a Melbourne agent woke up the Bene-
volent Asylum bosses and got them to put
in a claim. Meanwhile, George Herbert
Lanman’s three children had assumed that
grandfather had departed this life intestate,
and they were moving Justice Joyce in
Chancery to hand them the accumulated
moneys, and Justice Joyce was just about
to do it, when the Benevolent Asylum people
put in their claim. And, everything being in
proper order, they got the money. It was
disappointing to the other three grandchil-
dren, George, Juliana and Harold ; but the
Law showed some discernment by ordering
their costs to come out of the estate. Some-
how, the Law always seems to be very care-
ful that Costs shall not be left out in the
cold.
A beautiful sentiment of. good old British
Toryism is enshrined' in a recent selection
of passages from Charles Lamb. In a letter,
dated 1824, Lamb remarked that: —
Alderman Curtis advised the Radicals, “If they
don’t like their country, damn ’em, let ’em leave it.”
—-they possessing no rood of land in England, and
he 10,000 acres.
The spirit of the long-deceased alderman
must be roaming around Britain in a very
perturbed state these times. Even the pre-
cious Territorial Army is infested with
Radicals—damn ’em —and two or three
companies thereof were required to hand in
their rifles during the recent strike of trans-
port workers —damn ’em—lest they might
shoot at the forces of Law’n’order.
The American brothers Wright, of aero-
plane fame, threaten to revolutionise air
travelling. They say they have discovered
“the secret of the flight of the vulture,” and
allege that it throws quite a new light upon
things. It is now up to the Wrights to in-
vestigate the secret of the flight of the trus-
tee. That should also throw some new light
upon things.

England is no place for the white man;
he “can’t live” there if the thermometer
runs past 90. The appendicitis that killed
Charles Buxton (son of the President of the
British Board of Trade, and grandson of a
former South Australian Governor)was part
of a regular epidemic in London in August.
A long list of other operated-on people in-
cluded Agent-General Coghlan (N.S.W.).
the wife of the cricketing Lord Harris, and
Emmy Wehlen, the “Merry Widow,” whose
sudden collapse played the deuce with a
New York co. that was rehearsing for her to
come over and play lead. London doctors
put the “wave” of appendix-trouble (lown to
eating food which had become tainted by the
i unusual heat —especially shellfish. The same
'trouble was all over the east end of London,
where winkles, cockles and mussels are
eaten wholesale; but among the “poorer
classes” it was diagnosed as inflammation, or
gastro-enteritis at most. You can’t have
appendicitis on less than £250 a year. In
the 77 larger towns of Britain, which keep a
record of these trifles, the deaths of chil-
dren under one year in the last week of
August only numbered 3020. Bruce Smith
ought to go over and talk to these English
people, and get them to shift.

Melbourne’s Chosen People take very
little interest in their ancient church nowa-
days. Last week’s gathering of noses at the
Synagogue Hall, to bid farewell to learned
Rabbi Abrahams, didn’t number 100 all
told. And among those devout few were
Sam Gillott, Weedon and Hennessy, of the
City Council, whose connection with the
tribes of Israel and Judah doesn’t extend
to the synagogue, anyhow.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
B’our aeroplanes, with Italian oificers as pilots,
have been sent to Tripoli. The intention is to use
the aeroplanes for the purpose of dropping bombs
into the enemy’s encampments.— Reuter, 16/10/’ll.
Italia’s bombs may not explode, when dropped
(These engines do not always work aright) ;
So, even if their downward flight is stopped
By Turkish skulls, the damage may be slight.
And yet, the venture need not be in vain;
Behind it other, graver terrors lurk:
E’en though the bombs misfire, a lethal rain
Of Dago airmen may afflict the Turk.

THE PICKLED UNIONIST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Hiram Maxim, wholesale manufacturer of imple-
ments of slaughter, suggests that when British sol-
diers are called out to quell “industrial unrest” with
rifles, their weapons should be loaded with scraps of
rocksalt the size of peas. The rocksalt would not.
penetrate far, and would act antiseptically on melt-
ing.
The principle so long applied
To herrings with pronounced success
Commends itself, and should be tried
On thankless workmen who transgress
To keep them good we plainly see
They must be salted thoroughly.
When British toilers weary grow
Of earning fourteen bob a week,
Aside their picks and hammers throw,
And run abroad in crowds to seek
More meat, the army calls a halt,
And kindly fills them up with salt.
“A salt and sorry rheum offends”
The stricken striker. Maxim says
The melting chloride makes amends —-
A man so shot will keep for days!
And Bull’s contented, being sure
The case was one of kill or cure.

THE PRIMITIVE FEAR OF THE DARK.
“A.Y.A.” : “Left Hand” may be right as
a general rule when he says (B. 28/9/T1) “a dingo
will never tackle an animal that turns on him, and
the ’roo . . . does this every time,” but I can prove
one exception, anyhow. In the Upper Burnett (Q.)
I came upon a magnificent specimen of a ’roo, lying
gashed and torn, and very much dead, amongst gory
leaves and rubbish. A couple of hundred yards
farther on I ran into a dingo equally defunct. From
neck to tail he was practically ripped opeir—in fact,
he looked like a butchered ribbon-counter. Gave it
a draw on circumstantial evidence.
“Scripture Leaguer”; In this matter of
long-burners, what’s the use of mentioning such
fleeting things as old sheepfolds, dry swamp bottoms,
sawdust heaps and haystacks? What about a lost
Soul? Why, my Ker-ristian brethren, that will
burn for ever and ever. And what is “ever and
ever?” Ah, you pause. Far be it from me to give
my unworthy opinion; but this is how Brother
Skrouch defined it to the Bible-class. Said he: “If
once in every thousand years a little bird were to
fly away with one grain of sand from the seashore,
there would come a time when the last grain would
have been carried away. But, dear little ones, even
after the lapse of that great length of time it will
not be even sunrise in Hell!” Yet, perhaps, a neater
picture still was that painted by a R.C. priest, who
wrote a book of pious horrors, much patronised in
my childhood’s happy hours. There was a dull red
glow, that extended for countless millions of leagues.
The temperature was billions in the shade. Out of
the glow an anguished voice asked the time, and a
yell came back in reply: “Eternity.” Evidently the
American wooden clock had been burned in the con-
fusion.

“Sapphire Smith”
Let me tell “Vagabond’’ (B. 21/9/’ll) that the
Australian farmer has reason for his action in stand-
ing off and considering the motor-tractor with the
chilly eye of doubt.
In the first place, the contraption is trying to travel
in Australia on a reputation won on level, free-soil
prairies of vast extent, or in the oft-ploughed and re-
ploughed fields of England.
Australian farm land is liable to be broken with
billabongs, terraced with age-old river beds, and
chopped up with insane creek windings, and, in ad-
dition, it is often tough and stony.
Many of the roads to the railway that “Vagabond”
would have the motor-tractor traverse, hauling the
fruits of the ploughing, etc., are like the curate’s
egg, in parts excellent, for the rest bad; also,
sandy, boggy or stony, and broken and beset with
perpendicular creek crossings.
A further obstacle met with by the ploughing
tractor in Australia is the short furrow necessary
because of the broken ground and the erratic course
of creeks. A short furrow means lots of turning, and
that wastes time • it also wastes land, as broader
headlands are necessary than is the case where
horses are used, unless engine and plough are un-
coupled and turned separately, which means more
waste of time. In Manitoba or Dakota, where seven-
mile furrows are the rule rather than the exception,
it’s different.
Again, among the many makes, and they are
legion, of oil tractors, there are few, if any, that
can pull a good dray-load up the average bush road
grade. They give some sort of satisfaction in very
light soil, with level going and shallow ploughing,
but for a 14in. sugar-cane furrow (say) they’re
worse than inefficient.
There is a motor-tractor (the British War Office
uses it) that will walk up the face of the great
Pyramid, turn in its own length as on a pivot, and
that could tear the Federal capital site out by the
roots, but it can’t be got for less than £BOO, and it
may cost a thousand or more. And the average
cocky can’t rise to luxuries of that sort.
“Quidam” : Away out on the myall coun-
try at the back of the Hodgkinson, in North Queens-
land, the experienced prospector doesn’t camp in his
tent at night. Instead, he erects his calico sleeping
apartment, and sleeps 20yds. or so away from it.
This is on account of Binghi’s humorous habit of
occasionally heaving a spear through the tent —a
habit which has sent many a pioneer over the Great
Divide. It is a noticeable characteristic of the
sturdy, self-reliant men who prospect our wide hin-
terland that they sleep lightly, and have instan-
taneous possession of all their faculties on awaken-
ing. It would be interesting to know whether this
is a matter of evolution, developed by the circum-
stances that surround their lives, or whether it is
that the men who are supplied by Nature with these
qualities are more prone to take to wandering
and adventurous lives. At any rate, the man
who can wake up and fire his revolver simul-
taneously has a big pull in the myall country over
the man who takes time to realise where he is and
what he is going to do.
IN DARKEST AFRICA.
HE (breathlessly) : “And as I turned I
could see the black muzzle of the lion close behind me."
SHE (with relief) : "Oh , thank Heaven! But who had put it on the brute?"
“J.G.” climbs a hill:—
“Gip’s” word-picture of N.S.W.’s Monaro (B.
28/9/’ll) describes accurately the present appear-
ance of the Great Dividing Range. At the time of
writing the bush hereabouts is one vast and glorious
carpet of wild flowers. Native orchids of beautiful
form and color are everywhere. Every second sap-
ling has climbers festooned over its branches, and
the tree-fern gullies are fragrant with the odor of
the musk and hazel trees and other flower-
ing shrubs. Queer that when the local natives
get a holiday they mostly tear off to Fiji or some-
where, spurning the beauties of nature at their own
back doors. The writer knows no more glorious view
than can be got any clear day from the top of
Mount Disappointment, a peak of the Great Divide
nearly 3000 feet high, and only about 35 miles out
of Melbourne. The woodland, plains and hills of
Victoria stretch away for 60 or 70 miles all round.
From one side of this hill the river system of the
Goulburn commences, whilst on the other is the
watershed of the Plenty and Yarra Rivers. The ele-
vation got its name from Hume and Hovell when
they made their famous trip across N.S.W. and Vic-
toria in the early years of the 19th century. They
climbed the mount in the hope of seeing Bass
Straits .or Port Phillip, but failed in their object.
The day must have been hazy ; under normal circum-
stances Port Phillip and Corio Bays and the shipping
on them can be clearly seen without the aid of a
glass. As for this handy mountain being a tourist
or holiday resort it might just as well be in the
McDonnell Ranges, as nobody seems to bother about
it, spending their energies over the Buffalo, the
Grampians, or some far-away spot. The average
Melbournian has, seemingly, never heard of it.
“Wandy”: “White Ants” (B. 31/S/’ll)
ridicules the idea that Westralia is free from the
scourge of drought. Ere the opinion was published,
however, bounteous rains had fallen from Northamp-
ton to Albany, and everywhere the cockies are wav-
ing their glad whiskers in anticipation of a wonder-
ful harvest. Westralians do not contend that their
State is not subject to droughts; all they say is that
one hasn’t happened along yet. Last year W.A. pro-
duced 7,500,000 bushels of wheat; this year that
total will be almost doubled. Things generally are
booming on this side of the continent, and a solid-
arity exists with the boom which promises great
things for the future. Decayed fish vendors once
contended that W.A. would never produce any fruit,
but every shipment of apples last year topped the
London market; while grapes, which are not ex-
ported by the sister States, brought from 16s. 6d. to
335. per case. The fact that W.A. is a week nearer
the European markets than any other Australian
port, is going to make fruit-growing one of our
largest industries. Also, a start has been made with
the dairying industry, and a very few years will find
Cinderella Land the leading producer, of wheat,
fruit, timber, gold, and dairy produce in the Com-
monwealth. Perth’s belief in the staying power of
the boom is evidenced by the fact that buildings are
now being erected, or mooted, to the value of over
£500,000. Add to all this, that Westralia was the
only State to record a broad Australian vote on the
Referenda questions, and, believe me, it is the best
of them all.
“J. J.C.”: In the argument round the
stinging tree, “Settled” and other Abos. overlook
or are ignorant of the fact that there are two
distinct species or brands of the vegetable. One
wears a smooth shiny leaf, in shape like a fig-
leaf, and the other (which has the worst sting)
drapes itself in a very broad leaf, which is more round
than heart-shaped. The leaves are eaten with im-
punity by cattle; but I have seen horses die from
the stings. As an antidote, the blacks apply mud,
and, after considerable experience, I am satisfied
that it is the best remedy procurable. Neither nico-
tine nor ammonia is any good, but cold water is
beneficial, although, at first, it causes as much pain
as holding a burn to the fire. Another distressing
feature of the nettle is the violent sneezing attacks
caused by swallowing its dusty particles, and I have
seen severe haemorrhage from the nose and throat as
a result.
“Mallarapoonie”: “White Ants” (B.
31/8/’ll) predicts trouble, directly, from this boom
in land settlement in the west, and I want to tender
my moral support to his predictions. If one draws a
straight line from Albany through Northam, and
then bends it westerly through Gingin to meet the
Indian Ocean, he will have all the really “safe”
farming areas in Westralia yarded up on what may
be termed the Leeuwin Peninsula. Outside this area
(roughly, to the eastward of the Great Southern
line) the rainfall tails off badly, and every acre is
“dangerous” for wheat-farmers. While fair seasons
have obtained, settlers have belted a mediocre living
out of the so-called wheat belts of the dangerous
zone; but the person who takes for granted the last
six seasons to be a fair average for those regions is
living in a fool’s paradise, and is likely to inherit
the fool’s reward. Many settlers have re-
cently taken up -wheat land as far east as Merredin,
almost to Southern Cross, and these folk are simply
squatting on a volcano or a dynamite factory. Yet,
contrary to all evidences of the past, the Govern-
ment is pushing well-intentioned men out, and bald-
headedly building rattle-trap railways to the verge
of the Impossible—into the regions where “W. Ants,
Esq.,” says blue ruin is as inevitable as Judgment
Day. The whole thing is a boom, with wheat-straws
in its hair. One trouble is that most Westralian
farmers have only one iron in the fire —wheat. If
woolgrowing,' or something, were combined with it
the pursuit of grain would be a safer proceeding.
But it is Westralia’s rotten luck that it is the least
favored Of the States for any kind of farming. It
is distinctly one of the lightest stock-carrying coun-
tries on earth, and a standby of really serviceable,
drought-resisting natural grasses—like, say, the Mit-
chell, of Queensland —isn’t to be found in the State
as a general thing. Even the mulga belts don’t ex-
tend to the farming districts, as a rule, and, for the
rest, the wheat area is light herbage country in de-
cent seasons, and a Sahara in dry ones. So, before
the State can safely settle its dangerous though
fairly fertile inland zones—I admit they can be
safely settled —it will require to consider some
gigantic scheme of irrigation to assure the settlers
against extinction When the necessary moisture re-
fuses to fall from above.
“Warradulla”: Brother Abo-liars, verily
I say unto you that wool is the longest-winded
smoulderer which grows, accumulates, runs, jumps or
flies in Australia. These few bare facts will prove
the point. At Balyattla station, on Ya].cowinni
Creek (N.S.W.), a stack of old wool caught alight
in 1907, and ever s nee has defied every known and
unknown extinguisher. First, it was swamped with
water, but it cheerfully went on burning. Next, it
was covered up with sand for 12 months, but on
being unearthed, it was found to be still alight.
Rain-storms have fallen on its chest, dust-storms have
shrilled through its hair, thunder and lightning have
clamored wildly oVer it, hurricanes have threatened
to devastate it, but the wool-stack still goes oh with
a grim determination to burn till Time is done
with and Eternity dies of old age with perished
planets in its hair.
A DAIRIAD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Why, when I was six, I usually milked eight or
nine cows in the morning before starting for school,
which meant a four-mile ride. Now, my little
daughter of five runs over to the bails, and just for
pastime milks three or four or five cows, and en-
joys the fun ; while her big brother of seven milks
from seven to 10 cows with perfect ease.”— Glad re-

I sit and dream how oft
I played sweet games like these.
When I was but a child,
A toddling infant small,
I saw the herd and smiled
With zeal to milk it all;
My little hands were wet
With white streams hissing through,
And all my soul was set
On cow-juice in the dew.
In boyhood’s callow days,
My passion gathered force,
I scorned the heedless ways
• Of bushcraft, game or horse ;
But singing o’er the pail
Until my task was done,
My hands cculd never fail
Of milking twenty-one.
When grown to man’s estate,
In pride of strength and arm,
I thanked my happy fate
The cow-bail kept its charm ;
With fifty udders full
Beside me in the dawn,
I sat me down to pull
Till all the milk was drawn.
It is not wealth I crave;
My days like meadows flat
Sing tribute to the brave,
Strong soul of butter-fat ;
The separators turn
To part the flying cream,
While rolling seasons churn
My mellow milking dream.
• And, day on pleasant day,
The golden dawn is mine,
I joy that I can play
With teats of happy kine;
My cheek on velvet soft,
The white flood hissing clear,
I sit and think how oft
A cow had power to cheer.

“B.T. ’: When Mrs. Power ran away with
Clamp, the consensus of sympathy in: and about
Woollybutt was with Clamp. In the absence of a
really convincing excuse for his action, Clamp was
voted mad by a three to two majority, and Woolly-
butt let it go at that. Meanwhile", .lack Power was
behaving like a man with a great" weight off his
mind and anew lease of life. He never complained;
he hadn’t a word to say against Clamp. Five years
went by, and then Power returned from a metropoli-
tan excursion in a shocking frame of mind. He
spent the afternoon and night consuming whisky in
Arbor s bar, and lifting up his voice in fierce and
blasphemous abuse of Clamp. Eventually the bar
felt tired: “Blarst it!” somebody said. “Carn’t yeh
let. bygones be goneb.ves?” “No I can’t!” squealed
Power. “Clamp’s a swine. He’s played a low-down
trick on me, and ain’t no gentleman. Eighteen
months ago my wife ran away from him with another
bloke, an' here’s the fellow been drawin’ his 10 bob
a week all the time!” Then Woollybutt understood.
THE FRIEND IN NEED.
THE TOUCHER: “ Let’s see , old wan, do I owe
you anything?”
THE TOUCHED: “No! Going round squaring
your debts , eh?"
THE TOUCHER : “ Well, hardly, I was just
seeing if I'd overlooked anybody. Lend us
a quid till Saturday , will you, old pal?"
“Leo Lear”: “Pick’s” 34-year-old hard-
wood posts (B. 14/9/T1) are in the bottle and rattle
stage when compared with some patriarchal weather-
worn specimens near the old Ettrick homestead, liev-
wood (Vic.). Three years ago there were still stand-
ing there two round posts of the original stockyard,
built by Colonel Learmonth on his arrival from Tas-
mania in the wake of the H'entys, the pioneer settlers
of Weary’s domain. The rest of the yard was burnt
on “Black Thursday,” Feb. 21, 1851, The derelicts
are stringy-bark or blue-gum, and on their behalf I
challenge all comers for the old-age, championship.
GAVE THEM ALL A CALL.
1ST TRAVELLER : “Pass any pubs along the road, mate?”
2ND TRAVELLER: “Nosh er (hie) bloomin’ one.”
“Pick” : The wild dogs that “Yalgoo” ap-
plauds (B. 21/9/T1), as experts at scaling walls
and fences, must be a more determined breed of
tyke than those which used to haunt the Monaro
(N.S.W.) woolgrowers. Up there, the rabbit-proof
wire-netted' fence, with top barbed wire, has proven
a complete baulk to the inroads of the Nunnick
warrigals which, in the old days, attended mut-
ton banquets on the Mount Cooper, Bibbenluke and
Gunningrah sheep-runs with the regularity of night-
fall. Among the shepherds and boundary-riders of
these stations, the first toast of a spree nowadays is
to the rabbit, whose advent led to the erection of
the barrier. The watch boxes, once used as portable
sleeping apartments by the sheep tenders, have long
since been thrown into the rubbish tip with Free-
trade and the Reform party.
“Cict”: In B. 21/9/Tl, “Pick” relates
that a cove over 60 years of age, and his son (who
was probably 95) “threw up 170 panels of one-rail
fence in a day.” Let’s dissect'it. To dig the post-
holes at the smallest margin they would have to
shift 91 cubic yards of Australia, and stamp, ram,
jolt and cram the major portion of same back again.
Then, granting that the posts were mortised cor-
rectly, and rails trimmed to perfection, they (these
posts and rails) would have to be carried to posi-
tion, which means that the two grafters humped
over 71 tons of timber. And when you take into
consideration that no fencer has his wood carved to
a nicety, but has to adze it considerable—say 30sec.
to each rail —I’d like to know what excuse I could
offer for withdrawing my original estimate of
“Pick” ? I’ll leave it to Mr. Speaker Willis.
“Jonnel”: “Condamine” refers (B.
14/9/’ll) to the sensations of him who deals in
brigalow. lie is right as to the grub’s share in the
trouble. Anyhow, the latter gets the blame, not to
say the blasphemy, in Mount Morgan, where, perhaps,
more sticks of brigalow are handled and dressed
than anywhere else in the State. Yet, the accursed
insect never appears in person. He merely breathes
on the stick, like the Angel of Death, and thence-
forward, the toiler who handles the infected wood
and, afterwards, essays to brush away an honest bead,
experiences the same thrill as though a currycomb
made of needles had been swiped across his fore-
head. Has “Condamine” ever met the prickle cover-
ing the back of the box grub? This reptile must be
a half brother to the brig curse. His effect is the
same, but his domicile is the bark of the grey box,
and he has a darker look in his eve and face than
his relation. Also, he marries very young.
“G.”: I note that “Sa Wen” (B. 21/9/’ll)
nominates Tasmanian soppy oak for the Hardwood
Stakes. His name supplies the reason. The vege-
table is one of the soft fancy woods used by Chow
cabinet-makers, polishers and carvers. During dry
seasons cattle chew it with gusto. At the risk of
being reviled for stating the flamingly obvious, I
hereby, and without hesitation, thrust good, old
\V .A. jarrah into the contest. When a section of the
Albany-Southern Cross line was washed away, we had
to use dynamite to disintegrate the jarrah logs. To
show the • versatility of the stout old herb, every
boat trading between Fremantle and the nor’-west
ports carries a log of jarrah as an emergency anchor,
for use when a “willy willy” bursts on the scene.
Yea, though all Asia gibber to the contrary, I will
continue to affirm that for hardness and heaviness,
jarrah is the Importer of the vegetable world.
THE LAGGARD.
AREA OFFICER: "On the word ‘salute’ bring
the right hand smartly, with a circular
motion, to the forehead, palm to the front,
thumb close to forefinger, one inch above the.
right eye , elbow in line and nearly square
with the shoulder. Keep the hand there
while you count six and then drop the arm
smartly to the side. Why don't you drop
your arm to your side? ”
ONE OF THE SQUAD (coming to the rescue):
“He's got an impediment in his speech,
captain. I’ve known him take an hour to
count two.”
“Tumumu”: In the North Island of Maori-
land, the bundle-bearer per boot, seeking or avoiding
work as the case may be, is still fairly well treated.
In the Wairarapa, where the roads, are rough and
the creeks still unbridgcd, the pilgrim with the
parcel receives quite a good hearing. He camps in
the shearers whare, and has a hot meal night and
morning at the eooKliouse, either with the station
hands or immediately after them. If workers are
wanted, the boss will give him a job, provided the
man with Matilda has a hankering in that direction.
If toil is at a discount, he goes on his wav, to be
similarly accommodated at another station the same
night. Should he he desirous of “doin’ a bit o’
washin’,’’ half an hour’s exhibition of axemanship
on behalf of the ’poisoner,’’ will, in most cases, so
far soften that flinty-hearted individual, as to induce
him to provide the wood-chopper with as much
tucker as will enable him to camp a day, or with
luck, two, at some convenient whare. In the Gis-
borne district the same holds good. Hawke’s Bay,
which a few years ago was in swagman’s parlance
the mutton track, or “fattenin’ paddock,’’ has
fallen from its high estate. Good metal roads and
bridges made it too popular. The meuu now consists
of “handouts’” of biscuits and cold mutton, and the
receiver is looked upon as a sort of noxious weed.
The man on the wheel is worse off than the traveller
per boot. In most districts about the only thing he
gets is the information that there is a pub or an
accommodation house a couple of miles further on.
A MIDNIGHT MELODY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I heard a sound of singing—singing far and faint
and splendid
On an old bush track romantic, fragrant gums on
either hand—-
A sound of voices bringing back old memories as
they blended
W ith the music of the forest in a manner truly
grand.
Along the bush-track wending, heard 1 dulcet strains
uplifting—
Sweet and distant sounds of jovance as of pilgrims
wildly gay
On scented air ascending—music near celestial, drift-
ing
Eight across the starry darkness as I tramped my
eampward way.
’Twas priest-like and sonorous, that tremendous
breeze-borne choiring, \ 1
And I stood there thrilled, and listened to the
musical affray ;
The slow-approaching chorus made me think of souls
aspiring. ,
“What,” 1 mumbled in the darkness, “is the sub-
ject of their lay?”
1 k°ard the anthem swinging, swelling long and loud
and glorious,
Bass and baritone and tenor making harmonies
sublime;
A songburst rich and ringing, which grew presently
uproarious
As the crowd arrived, still chanting, with their
bluchers tramping time.
Along that track romantic, with their loads of
labelled bottles,
Came the bunch of gay ones, roaring out their
message of good cheer
With top-notes shrill and frantic, through the blue
gums and the wattles,
Came the joyous, homing pilgrims with their heap
of lovely beer.
VICTORIA.
FRANK HENTY.
Present Settlement and Prospective
Bankruptcy.
During the last few days, C. G. Wade, of
N. S. Wales, has been citing his party’s Closer
Settlement and Land Promotion Acts as a
reason why he should be returned to office.
At Gunnedah he said :
was before them on the question of land settle-
ment. there had been an undue proportion of people
attracted to the cities and too few to the country
More people on the land meant more production.
(Applause.) His Government, during their term of
office, resumed 600,000 acres, almost all of which
were ready for settlement, and in good rainfall dis-
tncts. the Caucus Government had absolutely
dropped this resumption policy, confining themselves
entirely to the supply of Crown lands. Not a single
acre had been resumed by them under the Closer
Settlement Act.
lhe Wade party certainly did acquire
(500,000 acres of laud for purposes of Closer
Settlement. But it blewed £11,514,323 worth
of borrowed money on the transaction. And,
toi that vast sum, it got, together with some
fairly good land, a quantity of very arid,
remote and generally hopeless soil. The
AVade policy of closer settlement by resump-
tion has been well described as a system of
buying properties at high prices from the
knowledgable rich, and selling the same pro-
perties at considerably higher prices to the
confiding poor. The case of the Bibbenluke
estate is fairly typical. The “Liberals”
paid £00,792 for Bibbenluke's 10,210 acres.
The land is admittedly “second class,” and
it lies between 30 and 40 miles from any
lailway station. The Mahratta estate, a
worse bargain, consisted of 20,000 acres of
second-class land between 55 and 67 miles
front a railway ; and for this remote gem
the Wade Government disbursed £12,384
sterling. Of course, there are people who
enthusiastically applaud this sort of lun-
acy, and who are pouring subscriptions into
the colters of ‘ Liberalism” with the object
ot perpetuating it. Every bank with a col-
lection of doubtful mortgages rejoices at the
spectacle of the taxpayers’ money being used
tor the purpose of getting involved squat-
teis out of their difficulties. Every squat-
ter who is not involved, but who is anxious
to dispose of his pronerty at an exorbitant
figure, in order that he may live abroad on
the interest, gives three hearty cheers, in a
metaphorical manner of speaking, every
time the Wade land policy is mentioned in
nis hearing. Lawyers, valuers, surveyors,
land agents, commission agents and hordes
of others who got fat “cuts" out of the 2i
millions squandered by the WADE-ites, con-
sider, lor obvious reasons, that “Liberal-
lsm is the only thing to save the country.
And the papers which adjust their views in
accordance with their advts. hold similar
oninions. But if N. S. Wales agrees with
these interested parties, it will be a sign
that its intellect has gone wrong, and that
its political education has been neglected.
(If course, the State wants settlers. But,
incidentally, it wants them solvent, and it
doesn t want to go bankrupt acquiring them.
After years and years of “Liberal” admin-
istration, the local land hunger is so frantic
that agricultural gamblers abound every-
where. These are ready to rush any land-pro-
position, on the off-chance that, if thev get
the soil, Providence will do the rest. When,
as in the case of a Mahratta estate farm,
the land stands the hungry one in about
£4 per acre, and is second-class at that, and
00 miles from a station, it is asking too
much of Providence. On the figures, it is
the Australia Hotel to a pint of beer that
oO per cent, of the owners of the 1583 farms
made available by “Liberalism” will burst
financially unless the age of miracles re-
turns. During the last 18 months the tally
of farmers working on the “halves” system
has increased wonderfully, and, in despera-
tion, numbers of unfortunates have lately
started on the “thirds” system—an arrange-
ment whereunder the tenant provides all
tools, labor and machinery, and gets one-third
of the profits, while the landlord takes the
rest. Looking at it by and large, and from
other aspects, the Wade land policy has
proved bad business for the State, and worse
business for the farmer. The wonder is that
the calamity should have been dragged into
the open by “Liberalism,” when it would
have been so much subtler to have tried to
bury it.


(3) He offered a full and frank
apology. Then, on an afterthought,
he remarked that the Speaker was
a dog, a thief, and a scoundrel of
the deepest dye.
(I) He made a disrespectful exit
(2) And was brought back by
the Sergeant-at-Arms to apologise.
(4) At the same instant he threw
:he water bottle, which broke on
;he wall above the Speaker’s head.
(5) By the exercise ot extraordin-
ary agility he managed to get
across the floor ahead of the Ser-
geant-at-Arms and other function-
aries and broke two windows with
the mace He remarked in pass-
ing that the Speakers grand-
mother was a monkey-
(7) Though most of his clothes
were gone by this time, he hung
on to a door-handle long enough
to declare that the Speaker drank,
never washed, and had committed
enough crimes to earn to years'
gaol.
(6) There was a greal ball of men struggling on the floor
From the m'idflle of the dust-cloud came the voice of the member
for Timbuctoo declaring that the Speaker made his first rise by
stealing catifle.
(8) He disappeared
amid a whirl of rags
and oaths, declaring
that the- Speaker had
three wives living.
sdfg
(9) He was expelled and disqualified for life; but.
as he remarked at the hotel opposite, he was the
sort of member who didn’t go out w.thout getting
value for his money, anyhow.

ITEMS
Of Daniel Wickham, who died recently in
a correspondent alleges three things:
1 1) „? ?h , at , Dan ’ 1 was a * ed S 5; (2) that
Dan l s father died aged 104; (3) that Dan’l
shook hands with every Governor S.A. ever
possessed.
Burgoyne (aged 85), speaking in the S.A.
Assembly last week, stated that 40 years
ago he was the first employer in the State
to concede the eight hours system to his
men, and the Labor members didn’t ques-
tion the claim. Burgoyne has lived in S.A.
tor bO years, and when the Constitution
was given to the State, in 1855 (the first
Assembly was elected in 1857), he was one
ot the battlers for manhood suffrage, one
man one vote, and payment of members.
Died recently, at Stony Steps (Tas.), John
Lees Livingston, who was one of the little
coterie that engineered the escape of John
Mitchel, the Irish exile. Mitchel left by
ordinary passenger steamer, in spite of the
look-out that was kept for him. The story
goes that his friends bluffed the shipping
office by telling the truth that the ticket was
for John Mitchel—the Irish exile, of
course. After a very strenuous life, Liv-
ingston, some years ago, having reached 70
remembered that his father and grandfather
had died at that age; so he retired to his
bed, to follow suit; but as 12 months
elapsed, and nothing serious occurred, he
went back to. active life, much refreshed,
and outlived his expectations by 17 years or
so.

About a Border sport:—
tvT^ od °P ga boasts a sportsman of the olden
type. George Pardon, who keeps the Border Hotel
ls .. an irrepressible boy of 52, backed himself!
home time ago, to walk from Wodonga to Wan-
garatta m 19 hours, and won his £2O with nearly
Hr a ,„°" r n spare l Later on - h e backed himself to
draw a suiky and a 12-stoner over the same course
hours. The passenger weighed a trifle too
much for the gallant pub-keeper, who weakened a
lot in the last stage oi his journey, and was beaten
by four minutes. Then he bathed and fed himself,
and caught the express for Wodonga, where the
township solaced him with cheers of sympathy, and
did its best to restore his lost quids at the bar
counter. The term “sporting publican” has a wide
range. At one end sits the pot-bellied football bar-
racker ana student of horse-racing; at the other
stands the athlete who pulls a sulky, with a fat man
mounted on the perch, a distance of 45 miles for a
harmless wager.
. A terribly-afflicted consumptive, who sui-
cided in a N. S. Wales public hospital the
other day, was a cousin of Australia’s first
G. Hopetoun.
The oldest bridegroom married in Victoria
during 1910 was aged 99: —
He rises from the marriage feast,
Expecting shortly to be sent hence ;

Can have small leisure for repentance.
Something like a shred of romance at-
taches to the loss of the Yongala. Among
the presumably drowned was a steward who
is said to have left three live widows, and
to. have taken his will to the bottom along
with him. When last heard of, the corrod-
ing tooth of Costs was at work on the little
estate. Costs are never drowned.
~ number. of J’s.P. were removed from
the N.S.W. list last week, on the ground
that “their addresses cannot be ascertained.”
And among the sunk or vanished or missing
appeared the name of Daniel O’Connor. If
that was N.S.W.’s picturesque, bell-toppered
old Dan, it is a hard blow. Surely that
wondrous figure hasn’t sprung a leak and
gone down with all hands.
Alexander Buchanan, the acting S.A. Su-
preme Court Judge during Gordon’s absence
on the Sugar Commission, started life as an
auctioneer, and thereafter was successively
managing law clerk, special magistrate and
Master of S.A. Supreme Court. The ap-
pointment came as a surprise to most of
Adelaide’s legal men, who expected to see
either Russell, S.M., or Crown Solicitor
Dashwood fill the vacancy.
Blunt Jack Verran, Premier of S. Aus.,
brings many a moment of joy to the Assem-
bly. Ihe last happened when, reading his
notes in the Assembly concerning the Bill to
prevent the use of white phosphorus in the
making _of matches, he said “white phos-
phorus is very poisonous, and is used for in-
fanticide.” It should have been “insecti-
cide” ; but a little difference of that sort was
of no consequence to John.
Of the six South Australian-born members
who were elected by that State to the first
Federal Parliament, in March, 1901, no less
than five have died. There were only two
native-born Senators, Downer and Baker,
and Baker is dead. The representatives
born in the State were Kingston, Holder,
Solomon and Batchelor, and every one of
them has gone. Moreover, every one of them
was a six-footer, or thereabouts, and King-
ston, Baker and Solomon were burly as well.
When Splintery Wood, breaking the
patience of the Speaker of the N.S.W
Assembly, the other night, was “named,”
it was a coincidence that Arthur Grif-
fith, being in charge of the House,
should have had to move the member’s sus-
pension. The last to be suspended up to
that time was Griffith himself. For accus-
ing the Speaker of unfairness, he was passed
out, in November, 1908, and, rather than
apologise, resigned. But of course Sturt
re-elected him unopppsed.
/- t P a T id Brown - who died at Malvern
(Vic.), a few days ago, was the first man
to put down an artesian bore in this coun-
ty- 1878, when he was manager
°.t G. and S. Officer s Kallara station, on the
river Darling. His proposition was at
hrst much ridiculed, but the ridicule turned
to joy when Brown proved the existence of
apparently unlimited supplies of water. He
ought to have rested on his laurels, but
he hankered for political fame, and was
one of the Victorian Senate candidates in
the lusion interest at the last election.
He withdrew, however, in favor of Tom
Skene, who died a few days later, while
prosecuting his campaign.
H. T. Morris, just dead in Adelaide, was
famous chiefly as an item in history. He
was one of the handful remaining who came
in the. Buffalo in 1836, and heard the pro-
clamation of South Australia read under
the gum-tree at Glenelg by Governor Hind-
marsh. His Ex. was uncle to the boy Morris,
then 13. Later, he did gold-digging in Cali-
fornia, and around Bendigo, was a Govern-
Dient jaluator, then a station-manager, and
for 13 years Chief Inspector of Sheep. He
probably did his best work in the last-
mentioned billet, for he pretty well stamped
out scab in the province; and the leading
sheepmen forced on him a gold watch and
xoOO as an acknowledgment.
Returned to these shores, Benjamin Short,
, e A.M.P. Society, one of Australia’s
oddities. He started in the society as a
canvasser in the early days, and roamed
through Australia and Maoriland in search
or uninsured lives. His boast is that he was
personally responsible for £5,000,000 worth
9L, Policies, taken up by 12,000 persons.
When he retired, in modest affluence, years
ago, he sought a seat on the Board, and
was not looked on with cordiality by the
then directorate; in fact, Benjamin is the
one man who has ever been elected to the
Board of the A.M.P. except on the office
ticket. But votes from the four ends of
the earth poured in for Short, from scores
a x? e i9 ple who f that Short was the
A.M 1.; and he was triumphantly elected.
He has just returned from a trip to the
Coronation, and, quite naturally, spent
£i2r onaßon in Durham, lecturing on
The Tabernacle of Israel.”
Sol Bloom, who is putting up against
Vic. Labor-leader Prendergast, has barely
covered his quarter-century of years. Since
childhood he has been a spoilt darling of the
amateur stage, and. as women have now a
large say in the elections, he may haA’e a
chance of tacking M.L.A. to his name. A
young stage blood, with the courage to make
his first fight in the face of heavy odds
might be vigorous enough to get into the
House. Whether Sol would do any man
good when he got there, is quite another
question.
Dave Gordon who is the Deacook candi-
date for Batchelor’s seat in the Reps., was
for many years leader of the Register staff
He tried for a Senate seat last election, but
was beaten, and since then he has been
doing propaganda work for the bad company
he keeps.

• Hollis, allegedly the oldest man
in the Commonwealth, collected his tomb-
stone last week at Pippinbarra, near Port
Macquarie (N.S.W.). According to the
testimony of the family, he was born in
Buckinghamshire (England), 107 years ago.
It is added that he came to Australia about
IUU years ago. As his descendants couldn’t
very well be born then, unless he married
very young, it is probable that they were
born here, and made no personal investigra-
tion as regards the date of their progenitor’s
birth. It is mentioned with pride that, until
six months back, he used to ride about the
bush looking after cows. Moral: “Look
after the cows, and you may live to be 107.”
Sir Robert Peel, Bart., who, according to
was arrested lately for obtain-
in„ credit from a London hotel without dis-
closing the fact that he was an undis-
charged bankrupt, is one of the vast army of
insolvents who owe their downfall to the
curse, Woman. “Bobby” Peel, as he was
known from one end of London to the other,
-U years ago, never gambled, raced or drank.
All he did was to fall under the spell of the
most famous professional beauty of the dav
His substance vanished like smoke. He got
down to the stage of attempting to sell the
P'ctures in his entailed ancestral hail •
which, in the case of a once-moneyed bart.'
is something equivalent to a mere commoner
essaying to pawn his boots. He married
money later, and has lived in quiet obscurity
tor some time now. A queer feature of his
latest escapade is that the hotelkeeper should
have needed to be informed as to his financial
status. The money-troubles of Peel are as
familiar to Londoners as the matrimonial
troubles of Lord Rosslyn. He is a grandson
of the great Peel—-“ Orange” Peel, the man
who gave London its “Bobbies” or “Peelers.”
“D.M.R.”; Melbourne’s Scawtch College,
which is celebrating its diamond jubilee, has
had only three principals in its 60 years. In
the days of Lawson, the founder, the school
was in Spring-street. The original building
is still in existence; a Chow cabinet-maker
desecrates it now. Lawson was followed by
Hr. Morrison, a stern but kind-hearted mar-
tinet of the old school. “The doc.” had a
favorite expression: “I’ll maul ye, ye black-
guard—well, you’re a blackguard as far as
your work s concerned” —which will be affec-
tionately remembered by hundreds of old col-
legians. With Morrison’s advent, the school
was moved to its present situation on East-
ern Hill, and portion of the original buildin<«-
is still used for class rooms. Associated with
the doctor was “Bob” Morrison, his brother
a man more generally revered than his
sterner and bigger relation. “The Doc.” was a
hale, broad, thick-chested, six-foot Celt. Bob
was a weak, slight figure, popularly credited
with, having only one lung for many years
previous to his death. Littlejohn, the pre-
sent principal, followed the Morrisons upon
the death of the doctor in 1902. His son
was a Rhodes scholar, and rowed in the Ox-
tord-Cambndge water disturbance last year.
H rank Shaw is the oldest inmate, and has seen
all the regimes, first as a scholar, and later as
a master. He is still in harness—a slim, bald-
headed, dried-up piece of humanity, with a
heart of gold taking up most of the inside
space. Of old boys”—well, Australia is full
ot them. There are three in the Murray
Government. George Reid is another. Dr.
. Mmjey TT IS one of the half-dozen
in the House of Reps. Dr. George
Morrison, so long associated with Gee-
long College, was a brother of Alec and
Bob. Dr. Morrison, the Times correspond-
ent, was a son of George’s. Another son was
Norman, whose recent tragic death was so
universally deplored. He had followed his
father as principal of Geelong College.
One of the leading law firms in Adelaide,
though composed of three notably serious
men, has a cable address which is dis-
tinctly frivolous. The partners are Bake-
well, Stow and Piper, and they have run
their names together to make a sporting
compound: “Bakstoper, Adelaide.”

From the Office Sexton:—
ChaiTe s Westall Lloyd, of Bobinawarrah (Vic.),
said to be a lineal descendant of an ancient British
king, was gathered to his remote fathers a few days
ago. He is alleged to have come of a Welsh-Irish
family, that traced its line back 20 centuries,
and to have been the 68th in descent from Belinus
the Great, King of Britain, as shown by professedly
reliable records. Belinus the Great is not an easy
man to identify amid the roar of 20th century
tram cars and the shouts of the boy who is selling
H*® evening football edition; but, presumably, he
chased the buffalo in London, and did other hefty
deeds. These old kings mostly called themselves
Pendragon, or Basileus, or “Csesar of the whole of
Britain, or “Emperor of England.” But perhaps
Belinus had more sense and scorned all this archaic

THE SALE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
*Jr. Wade complained that his party had been
sold like bullocks. —Daily Paper.
We may have each our price, as cynics say;
But sorrow grips us, and our feet are cold
To know our party in its noisiest day
Like bullocks sold.
Had we been true, no man of all our crew
Had e’er betrayed his leader for a wig;
Alas, I stand forlorn of place and screw—
Sold like a pig!
Oh, patriots, rise! The horror of the sale
Sits in fierce shame upon my burning brow ;
I am amazed, aghast, disgruntled, pale—
Sold like a cow!

This co. started business in 1888, and the Nailer-up
of Signboards hasn’t had a single job to do for an
Australian bank since—that is, if you cut out one or
two State Advances to Settlers’ institutions from the
catalogue of banks. There was a lot of trouble
waiting for infants in those days, and the under-
taker had a very busy time; but this co. got
through, on the whole, very well indeed, and, especi-
ally of late, has made remarkable progress. Ten
years ago its total deposits were only £552,460 ;
to-day they are £2,097,477. Then its advances
were £511,980; now they are £1,621,074. For-
tunately it has seen the wisdom of making its capi-
tal keep pace with its business; in 10 years the
capital has been doubled, and now stands at
£300,000, while its reserves have bowled along from
£21,809 to £163,172. Thus, between the doubling
® the capital and the solid growth of the reserves,
what looks like a safe ratio has been preserved be-
tween the shareholders’ funds and the public’s money
in the business. To-day there are only a few pence
under £5 of the latter to every £1 of the former,
and if that isn’t good enough there are various
others that are wretchedly bad. Moreover, the posi-
tion is strengthened by the big proportion of the
publics money that is held liquid. Altogether, the
bank owes £2,218,425, and it has no less than
£1,013,082 in cash and assets that can be promptly
changed to cash, and that means an excellent 45 p.c.
This is at a time of year, too, when money is usually
pretty tight, the wool and wheat harvests not having
yet been shorn. For the depositors there isn’t a
headache or a worry in a hogshead of such figures;
while from the shareholders’ point of view the
position is that, on the figures, good money is being
made notwithstanding a prudent and even conserva-
tive policy. Of course one can’t from the accounts
tell what sort of securities the bank is lending its
money on. They might be a rotten lot and liable to
crumble if a bad season or two hit this country, and
one couldn’t tell it from the published balance-
sheet. But from the steady strengthening of the
bank’s cash position, and from one or two other cir-
cumstances, one can get at least a hint that the
management isn’t out to break things.

That is £413,756 of the public’s money dropped in
during the year, of which £205,247, or rather less
than half, has been lent out again. With a large
sum liquid or semi-liquid, and with comparatively
small liabilities compared with shareholders’ funds,
large earnings would not be expected; yet, calcu-
lated on capital and reserves combined, they show
these very satisfactory figures:—

A profit of close-upon 9 p.c. in the circumstances
suggests one of two things—risky business and high
rates, with the chances of a sickening thud pre-
sently, or a very solid lot of securities, with no
lame ducks among them. This paper can’t say for
certain which it is; but at least it can be said that
the lame ducks left over from the troubles of the
’9o’s must be quite insignificant now, and the
past few years, in which the co. has acquired the
bulk of its business, haven’t been favorable to the
production of new lame ducks. Or, at least, the
ducks may be lame; but they can disguise it while
things are prosperous.

This co. was formed in 1884, and the fact that in
1899 the dividend was only lj; p.c. is a pretty
strong hint that something went wrong in the in-
tervening 15 years. As a matter of fact, several
things went wrong, including various mortgages and
other advances into which the co. had dropped the
shareholders’ probably hard-borrowed money. Also,
the co. had burdened itself with an expensive block
of leasehold offices; moreover, as is always liable to
happen after a slump in values, the beneficiary under
one of the wills of which the co. was trustee gave
much trouble in the courts. The co. has, no doubt,
been pulling itself out of its troubles, though it is
still impossible to say whether assets are down to
bedrock. They include advances on mortgage,
£10,654; advances against beneficiaries’ interests,
£4143; and bank deposit receipts, etc., at valua-
tion, £4063. The savings of the past few years
have been put into freehold office premises ( £13,950,
with a mortgage of £5000). What the assets are
yielding is effectively disguised by lumping the in-
come from that source with commissions and other
earnings ; nor do the directors give the total value of
the estates in hand, by which one might judge ap-
proximately the progress made by the co. in the way
of securing new business. The management, how-
ever, gives what look like two “straight tips” that
things are going the right way: (1) the profit, after
providing for contingencies, has been steadily mount-
ing; (2) a bonus of £205 has this year been paid
to the staff, and in the foregoing table has been de-
ducted from the profits.

This shrinkage of premium income is rather de-
plorable, especially when we remember the vast
proportion of the Australian fire and marine busi-
ness which still goes to foreign concerns. The co.’s
funds are practically all out on mortgage; and that
is undesirable, too, inasmuch as an insurance office
may be called upon suddenly for a big lump of
money, and a big lump of money is hard to get
in quickly when it has to be collected from a host
of mortgagors, many of whom have probably been
hit by the same disaster.

This Melbourne building society has been able’ to
say a quite extraordinary thing—“ The directors
recommend a dividend at the rate of so-an-so on
the original capital.” It went through the land
boom, and though it got a few bruises, and a black
eye or so when the thing collapsed, it didn’t sprawl
m the gutter. It didn’t have to either shut its door
m the face of depositors or reduce its own capital,
lhe worst that happened was a deep silence for
some years on the subject of dividends, and an
arrangement with “investing shareholders.” At the
time of the general smash, back in the early ’9o’s
the society had £21,269 of reserves. It trans-
ferred the lot to a contingency fund, and, as assets
were realised, any losses were made good out of this
reserve. When the reserve began to look slack about
r ,!l e . wai st-band, it was fed up with current profits
things have gone along like that until, during the
past year, the directors decided to do all the
prospective writing down in a lump; and the last
line shows what happened. The contingency fund
has thus wholly disappeared: and, if the revalua-
tion has been done thoroughly—as it appears to
have been—the reserves don’t deserve to be re-
ierred to as nominal” any more.
The next table shows how business has moved
during’ the past few years:—

The permanent share capital is £64,270, and there
is also £9902 of “investing” and withdrawable
capital. Compared with this, deposits, etc., are
therefore still very moderate, in spite of a steady
increase. An excellent feature is the rapid clearing-
out of foreclosures, which has liberated funds for
hve business. This business appears to be very
profitable: the average gross return on advances is a
shade over 8 p.c. Yet the dividend is a modest
5 p.c. ; and though there is now a very safe margin
between that and the profits, nothing much beyond
(say) 6 p.c. can reasonably be expected while there
is so little public money in the business. It is only
when such a co. as this plays with big lumps of
other people’s money, and has to stand the racket
when anything goes wrong with the works, that
shareholders can reasonably look for anything be-
yond 6 p.c.

The co. paid 4 p.c. for the first half of the year and
ii p.c. for the second half. The amount shown
as written off is in further reduction of the book-
value of properties in possession. The directors
put it this way: “A revision has been made of the
book values of the residue of improved properties
(now reduced to a small number) remaining in the
possession of the co.” Turning to the balance-sheet
it will be found that these assets are lumped with
others in this very unsatisfactory way: “Advances
on mortgage, properties in possession and freeholds,
£211,648.” It is impossible to tell from this what
unimproved properties the co, has on its hands; yet
unimproved properties are usually more of a night-
mare than the improved ones, which, as a rule, bring
in something more than rate notices and tax papers.
However, the chances are that the unproductive
properties don’t amount to any great proportion of
the untidy heap; this paper judges so from the fact
that the interest and rents are equal to just upon
7 p.c. gross on the whole heap. The present paid
capital is £87,763, including £4536 calls paid in
advance. There are two lots of shares; on the
second lot, of about 47,000, there is a liability of
los. 6d., and calls payable in advance are entitled,
by a resolution of the co. in October, 1910, to 4 p c
interest Besides its own capital of £87,763, the co!
has £443,656 of deposits to work on; and as prac-
tically all the money is in advances, properties and
premises, the shareholders are carrying considerable
risks. It wouldn t take much of a shrinkage in
values to wipe out all the reserves; and shrinkages
in values are apt to be very emphatic in Queens-
land. lienee the wisdom of keeping the divs.
down and pushing the reserves up. As for the
deposits, there can be no question that they are
well enough protected. The co. certainly hasn’t any
large amount of liquid assets —say £21,660 —but it
would have to be a tremendous blast that would
wither up the £244,559 of assets so much that
they wouldn’t be worth the £144,122 which the co
owes to the public.

The old Federal was an institution which a lot of
people still think of when they wake up at 3 a m
and hgve a fit of the blues. In the days of the
Great Smash it had nearly £400,000 of borrowed
money to account for; but it kept a wet towel round
its head for 11 years, and by 1904 found itself in a
position to go to the Supreme Court and ask for a
new hat and a clean suit of clothes. The surplus of
assets over liabilities was valued at the time at
£122,839; so a new co. was formed with a capital
of £96,351, leaving £26,488 to represent reserves—
a very solid provision against any more unpleasant
contingencies. However, Fleming, of the Yarra
Bank, wasn’t made dictator or anything of that sort,
so the unpleasant contingencies haven’t arrived. On
the contrary, the reserve fund has been swollen by
surpluses realised on properties sold; and current
business has also been profitable. Thing's have con-
sequently moved along in this pleasant way;—

Properties in possession have been reduced to very
little. On the other hand, advances have increased
from £63,160 to £182.928 in seven years. This,
of course, means some risk ; for if the property mar-
ket is so brisk and prices so good that the society
can make good sales of its own foreclosures, it is
pretty certain that .the level of values on which it
makes its new advances is also high. Nevertheless,
the building society is on a good wicket, because the
advance is gradually reduced; and unless a slump is
very sudden and very severe, such an institution
ought to be safely covered, given even ordinary
management. And so far as this society in particu-
lar is concerned the reserves are so very substantial
that it would take something extra in the way of
slumps to wipe them out and bite into the capital.

This used to be the Federal Building, Land and In-
vestment Co. though probably some people prefer
to call it the Bilked, Landed and Divested Co. Any-
way, its capital used to be £148,398, and it is now
£22,294 plus a little that has lately been got in
by way of calls. Certainly when three years ago it
was decided to have what it was hoped would be a
final cleanmg-up, £22,291 was also issued to the
old shareholders in the shape of debentures;
but as these debentures don’t carry any in-
terest, and won’t carry any until the shares
have had 6 p.c., and then are only entitled to half
the surplus profits, and as moreover thev rank after
creditors and capital, in every other respect, they can
scarcely be regarded as worth 20s. in the £. In'
fact, when they were issued the idea was to give the
shareholders something that they would be glad to
get rid of in exchange for some of the unproductive
land which has been sitting like a cargo of un-
digested crayfish on the co.’s chest. In the old
days—say, 1895—the co. had £103,000 of its own
and other people’s money represented by fore-
closed properties. By writing down these assets
hard, and offering them at the reduced price, practi-
cally the whole lot has been cleaned out; and to-
day, apart from a recently-acquired Queen-street
freehold, properties stand in the books at only
£5341. The other non-liquid assets consist of loans
and other advances (£67,236) and sundry land pur-
chasers ( £11,412). The present paid capital is
£23,997 ; and apart from the deferred debentures,
of which £15,111 are now outstanding, the liabili-
ties total £70,350. In proportion to capital, the
liabilities are therefore heavy; and a very proper
thing has been done in calling up more capital.
Half-a-erown a share will be payable by instalments
during next year; and there will still be 2s 6d.
callable. In the past 12 months the deposits have
been increased from £47,302 to £65,764, and in
view of that rapid growth of liabilities the co. ought
to have taken more vigorous measures to strengthen
its position. However, seeing that the last fragment
of the 2s. 6d. call isn’t to be got in till the begin-
ning of 1913, it is to be hoped that the directors
will do the next b°st thing—sit hard on the appli-
cation for advances that don’t allow a big margin
for the shrinkage of securities, and keep a solid cash
balance in hand. Also, dividends should be kept
down so that the reserves may have a chance N to
grow. The co. bas got a pretty shocking past to
live down, and the only way to do is to show that it
is determined to do most of the things it formerly
didn’t do and leave undone most of the things it
formerly did.

There are doubts about some of these figures. (1)
The present interim balance-sheet shows that an ap-
propriation of £1912 was made out of the previous
half-year’s profits to provide for the alteration of
premises, the nayment of bonus, etc. The previous
half-year’s report said that £lBl2 was the total re-
commended. The other £lOO drops in to tjie amount
without explanation. In the table the bonus to em-
ployees (£300) is deducted from profits. (2)

Cobar and most other Australian mining
camps are complaining of a shortage of labor. But
there's nothing to be surprised at in that, with so
many surface jobs available. Trivett, the N.b.VV.
Government Actuary, lately made an investigation
of the Ma State’s friendly societies, which include
over 130,000 members, and he found that, where
100 non-mining members might expect a day s sick-
ness, 138 mining members had that experience. At
, o me ages the proportion is much more ; between
41 and 45, for instance, it stands —non-mining, 99 ;
mining, 144. ur, putting it into money, the miner
costs the friendly society 275. 7d. in sick pay, where
it costs for the other fellow only 20s. And that is
apart altogether from the extra speed with which,
on the average, the miner calls for the undertaker.

of ore in sight, but development should multiply this
many times over. The Minerals Separation process

poration —is to be used; it is said that, in experi-
mental work, it has made an extraction which shows
a profit of 10s. per ton, with lead at £l3 and silver
at 2s. 2d. (fine).

Block 10 has been one of the recent
puzzles of Broken Hill, and the position isn’t made
clearer by the resignation and sudden departure of
Stanley Low, the general manager. The mine is, no
doubt, in a pretty bad way, and the mill is in a
worse. The struggle to find a good body of ore in
the bottom levels has been a very modified success,
and the quantity of ore that can safely be got out
from the upper levels is problematical. Perhaps
there are half a million tons altogether. But much
of the best ore is in rickety workings, and mining
costs pile up, even if the stuff can be reached. A
few months ago the mill was suddenly shut down,
and nobody explained why. Now Low quits, and no-
body explains why either.
“Boswell”: Cangai copper mine, Grafton
(N.S.W.), is just on the edge of the dividend list.
The mine should be a Bulletin favorite, for it
“owes not any man,” having been worked on C.O.D.
principles from the beginning. Ten years ago Jack
Sellars, tired and weary, sat down to rest in the
rugged Cangai hills, which look down on the Clar-
ence above Copmanhurst. He noticed a stone such
as he had never noticed before, and took it to W.
Volkhardt and Tom Harps, who, in turn, prevailed
upon Sam See to put up £lO for the lease. After-
wards a Frenchman, with the moniker of Napoleon,
pegged 40 acres adjacent, and Germany came along
in Wilhelm Zeitch and P. Kritsch. The different
camps struggled discordantly till 1906, when they
amalgamated, and an 80,000 share co. was the re-
sult. Since then, 27,233 tons have been smelted, and
3638 tons matte sent to Sydney, the gross proceeds
whereof amount to £115,000. Four furnaces put
through 1100 tons per lunar month, equalling 160
tons of stripped matte. Wages now total £30,000
per annum. The co. has its own engineering shop,
where every detail necessary for working the mine
is manufactured : it burns its own bricks in its own
kilns; owns 50 teams (44 bullock, six horse) for
transporting the wood fuel cut by its own buzz saws;
built its own police barracks and school, because the
“Reform” Government was too slow: has built most
of its own roads; keeps its telephone line to Cop-
manhurst in repair; and on eight-hour day was en
fete, when Sam See, chairman of directors, officially
opened a new tramway for fuel transport, costing
£lO,OOO. The chairman foretold thrippenny divs.
monthly after the end of this year.
* * * *
Lady Clare, Adelong (N.S.W.), sends out
a hopeful account of its bottom level at 400 ft.,
where 2 ft. of rich quartz is being driven on. A
winze from the 300 ft. level also shows a good reef
at the bottom, so with better equipment this show
may be expected to , raise some good crushings.
* * * *
Cosmopolitan, Hillgrove (N.S.W.), re-
cently put through 259 tons for 2120 z., and, count-
ing concentrates, the total for the month was 2520 z.
This was followed by a run of 750 z. off the plates,
from 143 tons put through in a fortnight. These re-
turns fail to provide enough money for mill con-
struction and the purchase of an adjoining block, so
contributing shareholders are asked to pay calls. _ It
may be a good thing to buy the Carrington mine, but
it is a most unusual thing to ask contributing share-
holders to pay up for such a purchase. With regard
to machinery, there is some justification for the calls,
for it is quite evident that present milling capacity
—lO tons per day—is inadequate with low-grade
stone to supply dividends for so big a mob of shares.
* * * *
The Kembla (N.S.W.) smelting and refin-
ing works must be in a bad way soon if things don t
improve. With Mount Lyell shut down and the out-
put from Mount Morgan much below what was an-
ticipated, the calculations of the co. must be pretty
badly upset.
■* * *
Gold dividends amounting to £98,327
were distributed by the Westralian cos. in Septem-
ber, making a total of £627,258 for the .expired
nine months of this year, and £21,978,661 since the
start of the industry. The October distribution so
far totals something under £lOO,OOO.

The ore reserves of the Ivanhoe (W.A.)
were estimated on June 30 at 1,010,297 tons, of a
gross value of £2,234,640. Chip 2.95. per ton off
to cover cost of extraction and loss in residues, and
there is a profit in sight of about £3,165. per share.
A check estimate by the consulting engineers (13.,
M. and Co.) gives the tonnage as 1,127,273, valued
at £2,437,727. Both computations show, a sub-
stantial’ drop in dividend value compared with those
compiled at the end of the previous half-year.
Some more gilded optimism regarding the
Golden Horseshoe (W.A.); “Future returns should
improve consequent upon the increased tonnage and
value of ore when the skips are working from the
1767 ft. to the 2120 ft. levels, about the end of Sep-
tember. Having to cage everything below 16501 t.
hampers work in' the lower levels, and limits opera-
tions, bul matters will improve when the skips are
working down to 2120 ft. Until we have all the
tube mills in operation, and our experiments with
coarse crushing complete, we are unable to say what
the utmost capacity of our plant will ultimately
he but we presume you are anxious to know when
we will be able to raise between 28,000 and 30,000
tons per month, which we can treat without any
difficulty. We will not be able to do this, however,
until development work is further ahead . U de-
velopment work was further ahead it would increase
both grade and tonnage. The position is gradually
improving, but at a slower rate than anticipated.
We have no anxiety as to the stability and future
prospects of the mine, but the fact that we are only
able to make slow progress towards again paying
regular dividends causes us a lot of worry. Every-
thing is being done, however, to improve the posi-
tion as rapidly as possible.” For nearly two years
the Horseshoe’s inability to fulfil official expectations
has been the most notorious feature of Westralian
mining, and as far as can be learned it is likely to
continue so for some time to come. Why the mine
was allowed to get into such a backward state, and
whv shareholders were not told the truth at the
start, instead of being kept in iterance until the
market had broken its neck, are quest ons which
might have been put to the mine authorities before
now; but apparently the time is not yet ripe for
doing such a presumptuous thing.
* * * *
Lupton’s Co., whose mine is, at or near
Barambie (W.A.), reckons that its prospects have
been visibly brightened by the intersection of a
faulted reef in a winze at 162 ft. As a result of
this windfall, the co. claims to have over 2000 tons
of “backs,” of a gross value of £12,000, as well as
ore in the south stopes, the estimated tonnage _ot
which is, however, not given. The vagaries of the
reef have rendered the sinking of a new shaft inevit-
able, and how to find money for this and other work
is a matter which the mine boss is now pondering
over - .
Greenfinch (W.A.) has issued another
bulletin on the subject of treatment plant. 1 his
states that a 5-head mill has been purchased, and is
on its way to the mine. The despatch of ore to
Kalgoorlie for reduction is to cease when 500 tons
have been sent away. So far, the recoverable value
of the crushed stone has been about one-fourth what
the presumably inspired local papers said it would
be, but, compared with the difference shown by other
Bullfinch concerns, between the estimated and the
actual extraction, this discrepancy is a mere cir-
cumstance. _ _
* * *
Gold Industry of W.A., Ltd., missed the
’bus. In the beginning it had 40,000 Bullfinch
shares, for which the shareholders were told that
£2 had been refused. Subsequently, the Adelaide
market was hit with big blocks of scrip, and, be-
lieving that the co. was standing m to the extent
of an eighth of the sales, the Odd Industry authori-
ties stood bv and let the other fellows have the public
to themselves. Later on. when prices had come
down from pounds to shillings, they thought it would
b» a good idea to get something on account. 1 hen
they found that Gold Industry of W.A.. Ltd., was
not in the iolce at all. A hurried decision was then
made to sell the whole of the 40,000 shares without
reserve, but by that time the day of fanev prices had
grone bv, and the co. bad to be content with an aver-
age net return of 13s. 6d.
* * *
Gwalia South (W.A.) reports for the half-
year ended July 31 a working surplus of £6460, but
as £1962 has been written off the value of plant and
£7995 (or £6226 more than was expended) has
been charged to development, the accounts show
a book deficiency of £3497. During the half-year
13 382 'tons were crushed, for an average extraction
of’7.l7dwt., and besides 15,000 tons of 345. ore
now estimated to be in sight, the co. claims to st ll
have an accumulation of 15,000 tons of 7s. sands
and 7780 tons of 6s. slimes. As regards the Gimlet
option at Ora Banda, the directors state that they
have until August next to decide about it. Under
the agreement the co. is required to do certain
specific work, and undertakes to spend not less than
£3OOO. If the option is exercised, the purchase
price is £28,500 cash, and a 10 p.c. share interest
in a new co. to be formed. Divs. amounting to
£31,500 have been dug out of the Gwalia show to
date, includ'ng one of £3500 paid during the half,
year just ended. The cash in hand totals £11,40^.
* * * *
Black Range West (W.A.), which has
part of the reef as it underlays out of the very pro-
fitable Black Range, has been hung up for some
months under exemption. At 364 ft. in a nortly drive
“a bulk sample over sft. assayed 78s. per ton, and
elsewhere there was no doubt about the co. having
the ore channel, and, in places, the gold. To get
settled conditions the workings must, however, go
deeper; and there seems to be a cursed lack of
pence for the purpose. Most of the shares are . held
in Sydney ; and Sydney isn’t a good backer of gold
mines If Charters Towers or Bendigo had a chance
of the kind, it would reckon itself in clover.
* * * *
Duke and Main Leads, Maryborough
(Vic.) has 9800 ft. to go before it touches the boun-
dary' ’The 2600 ft. of lead already treated, when un-
twisted from its curls, stretched out to 1800 ft. of
gutter, and this, when scraped, gave £223,000 of
gold. From this return the eo. has refunded £45,000
as profits to those who put up £61,500 of capital.
Last six months’ work showed some financial drift,
the dirt averaging 445. sd. per fathom, meaning that
lOAdwt. wash has about paid divs., development and
ordinary mine work. Cathcart, by the same token,
had l|oz. dirt, and still didn’t furnish, more than
£9231 to shareholders. ; D.uke and Main Leads is
tackling a field of wash 800 ft. wide, carrying patchy
and narrow runs of gold. If the gold could be con-
centrated into 300 ft. of gutter, the dry bones would
rattle ; but Nature doesn’t bestow its gifts that way
in deep-lead country. Manager Glover’s costs are
B|dwt. per fathom, so he is to get a Marathon
wreath from his thrifty Board.
* * * *
There’s always something breezy about
the reports from Cathcart, Ararat (Vie.), thanks to
George Bryant’s pluck, which is a sight more impos-
ing than his English. When he “has no hesitation
in saying that the property is still a valuable one,”
why demur ? Has not the mine, since he took
charge, passed out £42,200 in divs.? Haven t
shares been up to £5 10s. and down to ss. ? . What
account are these ups and downs when there is still
380 ft. of the gutter to clean un. and Bryant to do
the work? He has his new shaft going, there is a
tidy bit in the stocking, and the Central, down the
lead, to help with the prospecting. Up the lead the
Heather Bell tributary is developing ounce wash in
dry ground. So, although Bryant only owns up to
1300 fathoms of wash proved, or less than three
months’ work, he is able to inspire such confidence
that shares stand at a year’s purchase on the basis
of recent dividends.
* * * *
Another big Victorian alluvial show is
the Great Southern, Rutherglen, which cuckoos its
accounts every Caulfield Cup season, just in time for
the manager to personally engage in the cheerful
task of picking winners. His mine for the past six
months hasn’t helped shareholders much, as only one
wee div. has come from the handling of 7400 square
fathoms of wash. The dirt averaged 525. 4d. per
fathom, and costs ate up 475. 3d. On Maryborough
records, 124dwt. would give regular divs., but con-
ditions are dissimilar. The Great Southern is a
bigger mine than any on that field, and at Rutlier-
glen the ground overhead is heavier, meaning high
charges for keeping drives open. Also, the faces are
farther awav from the shaft, and the gutter is very
wide. The” best wash lies at the west side in the
north end of No. 12 rise, while in the south end the
run of gold is making to the east. Taken generally,
the mine has not moved up more than a peg or two
during the last half-year so far as prospects go, the
trouble being that panelling often fails to obtain
the prospects got when cutting up drives.
* * *
Victorian Manganese and Iron has got
its little railway Bill through Parliament, so the
wheels will soon be going round, thanks to treasurer
Watt’s stipulation of money up or no Bill, the co.
has put in pegs, not only round the manganese de-
posit at Buchan, but enclosing two big lumps of
iron ore at Nowa Nowa. Thus, it hobbles lip a fan
slice of the metalliferous resources of the \egetable
Garden. Now everyone is expecting the London
float, especially as the underwriters have called fol-
io,ooo shares of the recent issue of 50,000. A lot
of business effort is being put into the show, and
Victoria looks far nearer an iron industry of its own
than ever it has done hitherto.
Walhalla (Vic.) won’t get much comfort
out of the Long Tunnel report. With the Extended
idle next door, the co. has had to keep the pumps
hard at work ; and there hasn’t been the stone avail-
able to keep the mill going constantly, and thus
bring costs to the minimum. Working account thus
shows a debit of £1904. Fortunately, the co. still
has £15,000 of reserves in the locker. Meantime
the Board wails over the shortage of miners-—which
is another way of confessing that it isn t offering
good enough pay to successfully compete with other
employers. # *
Brilliant Deeps, Charters Towers, with a
rich shoot of stone making westward in the heart of
its lease, has become the hope of the field. There is
sft. of stone in two sections at the west end, and a
pinched reef of small value going east. The deepest
development work from No. 2 level has a strong
reef showing at the bottom of the winze, so it is
hoped that the stone in No. 4 West will extend some
250 ft., and thus come under this winze from No. 1.
But in a mine so capricious as the Deeps, one has to
be of a hopeful turn of mind to expect all the
talked-of developments to come off. #
Pfeiffer’s, Charters Towers, which al-
ready has 200,000 shares, has decided that it must
issue another 30,000, and, not to risk a bad failure,
the lot is to be made preferential. r ihe co. s trouble
—or the bank’s —is that the overdraft ( £6385) now
exceeds the uncalled capital. There is nothing very
promising underground ; the co. is just poking- about
in the hope that Charters Towers luck will stick to
it. Last half-year’s total gold was £1209. Over
this matter the directors’ arithmetic seems to have
slipped, by the way. The stone treated was 646
tons, and it averaged £1 17s. 9d. per ton. This
crushing, on the whole, was rather disappointing.
Two-thirds of the stone came from No. 4 a level, and
the balance from No. 1 hanging-wall level west, the
stone from the latter portion was heavily mineralised,
but the gold contents proved very small. The first
portion, if kept separate, should have averaged £3
per ton.” Two-thirds of 646 tons is 431 tons ; that
at £3 is £1293. Yet the whole crushing gave only
£1209. So there seems to be something wrong
with that £3 valuation.
* * * *
Kelly’s Queen Block, Charters Towers,
serves as a market horse once more, and many eyes
are turned on the next crushing. R ?ports are favor-
able about the workings on the reef at the 14o0tt.
level, where there has been an improvement in values,
followed by a smart rise in shares. The directors
think so much of recent developments that they in-
tend to sink an underlay shaft on the reef, which
will probably find its way into the Brilliant Central.
The latter’s shares are a gamble on the strength of
this chance. There is no immediate prospect of
dividends for Kelly’s, but it should get itself out of
debt and make a new start in life.
* * * *
Hampden South Consols, Cloncurry(Q.),
has extended its 250 ft. level to the northern boun-
dary, adjoining the Hampden lease, so it intends to
push on with development south of the shait, and in
doing this will continue to ship a few hundred tons
of 20 p.c. ore to Port Kembla (N.S.W.). There are
some 20,000 tons, averaging 12 p.c. copper proved
in the mine ; also, 40,000 tons oi low-grade fluxing
material, besides some thousands of tons of siliceous
ore requiring concentration. The proved length of
the latter is 450 ft., and its width, so far as it has
been proved in crosscuts, is approximately 30 ft.
These bulky ore-bodies make the directors sanguine
that there will be further discoveries at depth, so a
new shaft i 7 going down to the west. Nothing was
said at the recent meeting about amalgamation with
the Hampden, but hints have been flying round that
a general scheme is likely to mature, because most
of the ore in the various mines is siliceous, and in-
quires concentration.. The site chosen for a mill is
at Malbon, on the Cloncurry, 15 miles from Hamp-
den, and at the junction of the railway to the
Duchess. # *
Acting on the advice of Assistant Govern-
ment Geologist Cameron, the Bananaland Government
has decided to sink a bore at Roma, in search of oil.
The sale of the plant of the Rosewood
mines marks the final totter of one of the _ oldest
fields in Bananaland. Rosewood was opened m of,
and its early history was of the feast or famine sort.
Its later history was plain famine. The field was one
of many small excitements that happened m 66,
’67 and ’6B around Rockhampton. One of them,
Ridgelands, used to boast when it was alive that the
first Queensland Government reward was paid to two
of its claimholders. J. T. S. Bird, now mining re-
porter of the Rockhampton Bulletin, was one of the
pair. #
What looks like another tin mine has been
dragged from its hiding place among the hills of the
Tasmanian West Coast. The show is alongside the
Emu Bay Co.’s line, and less than 20 miles from
Bischoff. A tributary of the Pieman—-some sur-
veyor named it the X, being apparently too tired to
think up names for watercourses—runs alongside,
and should come in very handy if the ore body
holds out. After some months’ prospecting the sur-
face results were pronounced good enough to justify
a tunnel, a-nd this has tapped the lode at 70ft.
depth There are enrichments, as usual in tin lodes,
and some enticing slugs have been making the eyes
of Hobart bulge; but if it is anything at all, the X
Proprietary will probably be a big low-grade pro-
position. Ex-Mines Minister Mulcahy is one of the
interested parties, and, as London is said to be
hankering after lode tin propositions, J. Bull will be
given first chapce at it. Anyway, it has gone to
him introduced by a report from Bakhap, M.L.A.
* * * *
The oil business in Maoriland is now so
far advanced that the Government proposes to pass
special legislation to protect the borers. It seems
that the prospector who taps oil at (say) 4000 ft.
may have his flow turned to water by somebody
goirw 200 ft. deeper in adjacent ground, so regula-
tions' are to be made to keep pirates at a fair dis-
tance. G. S. Engel, who represents the British Shell
and Transport Co., now working at Kotuku, near
Grevmouth, talks largely of spending a million and
wanting 10,000 acres; but Maoriland has got rather
tired of tall talk, and -nowadays wants the oil to
speak for itself.
The South Aus. Radium Extraction Co.,
whose pot-holes are near Mount Painter, exhibits
some specimens of uranium phosphate ore in the
Sydney Mining Museum. A report also comes along
that a yellow mineral, giving a high test for radio-
activity, has been unearthed. So far none of the
shafts appear to be deeper than 50ft. The uranium
occurs as an oxide or phosphate. Pitchblende, which
is the main source of the Austrian supply, doesn’t
appear to have been found in any quantity ; and on
the strength of shallow deposits of gossanous min-
eral, containing a sprinkling of uranium, both the
two S.A. radium propositions are merely interesting
prospecting ventures. Until the market for the
metal is proved, this new |cind of mining certainly
cannot stand a heavy capital.
The Willunga (S.A.) quicksilver busi-
ness is to be liquidated. So ends the Melbourne at-
tempt to beat the Jew ring, which in Europe con-
trols the mercury market. On old reports everything
pointed to success ; to-day the story is no gold and
no quicksilver worth mentioning.
Good news for the coal-miner and the coal-
miner’s missus. A fire-damp detector, said to be able
to register one part of fire-damp to 400 parts of air,
has been exhibited before the Glasgow Mining Asso-
ciation ; and experts declare that it is O.K.
Out of the last Talisman (M.L.) divi. of
£25,575, some £18,561 comes back to local share-
holders. At the last distribution the M.L. register held
more than two-thirds of the total shares. Neverthe-
less, the directors are still elected and sit in London.

“Underlay”: Re highest price paid for
alluvial gold in Australia (13. 21/8/’ll). At the
Nick o’ Time rush, Tarnagulla (Vic.), gold was got
for which banks and storekeepers paid £4 Is. 6d, and
the Mint is said to have given £4 2s. 6d. for some
of it.

WOMAN’S
LETTER
Sydney, October 23, 1911.
My Dear Arini.—
Squeaks, yells, and other riotous noises
floated up Maequarie-street the other day,
and suggested a fresh outbreak of Wood
and Perryphobia in the ancient Parley-Zoo.
The plain citizen, sniffing the sea-breeze
from a remote kerb-stone, hurried along to
diagnose the case, saw no bodies falling
down front steps, went on farther, peered
through the portals of Government House
grounds, and put his finger on the place.
-Lwo thousand school-children were airing
their lungs as the guests of the G.-G. and
Gady Denman—that was all.
Merry-go-rounds were the strong drink of
the G.-G. s children’s party with heady re-
sults —hence the squeaks and other disturb-
ances. Ihe warrior staff, which played in-
line games and tried to divide itself into
-UUO sections, may have shaken itself to-
gether into one whole length—7ft. or so
apiece—later. While the battle of the games
lasted, Major Quilter, guardsman and son
ot Anak, was nearly torn to fragments by a
su f g o“ K u ma , ss °, f youngsters. Captain Stew-
art-Richardson’s last stronghold was a
straw hat, which bobbed on his head, about
or so above sea-level, while a
foam of short white skirts entirely
surrounded his boots. Captain Nutting’s
gold ropes were enthused over by in-
fantine admirers. “You’re very rich.
Mister, ain’t you?” clamored one small
* wis h I were,” said the perspiring
A.D.C. mopping his brow, the tilt of his
round, service cap allowing one portion of
his brain to be baked to a brick. “But
there s a lot of gold in those ropes round
your neck. Mister,” persisted young Aus-
tralia.
Lady Denman crept amongst her visitors
a 7 £ 1 uncd and ,Tud -y Party, at the rate
of halt a mile an hour, being entirely sur-
rounded by little girls, who clung like lim-
pets to her waist, arms, skirts, etc. The
Gee-Gee escaped with his life out of several
juvenile raids. Miss Quirk, whose eyes
are Irish blue (she brought them out from
Limerick), industriously fed with light re-
tieshments any child who had a chink in
his interior at 4 p.m. Private Sec. Vernon
overseer-in-chief and gold-quill-in-waiting
on the kmckerbocker party, steered a watch-
ful course round the juvenile herd.
The Acting-Gov. Cullens looked in; Pri-
vate-Sec. Verney steamed alongside in a
motor with his lady; .Lady King-Hall tore
herself away from missionary meetings for
five minutes. Unfortunately, the heathen
crackers imported by his Ex. from Nippon—
the kind that turn to wild beasts or flowers
in the air—were tucked up in the hold of a
vessel in port, no commands or entreaties
havjpg sufficed to dig them out in time.
Later on. Government House resuscitated
itself on its own front lawn with orange
pekoe and other desperate remedies prior
to the flight for Flemington.
P u ida loved a Guardsman!” mused
a 1 hilistine the other day. “Ah, but we’ve
changed since her day, and don’t walk about
now (if we ever did), in dressing-gowns
embroidered in seed pearls,” retorted one of
the G.-G. s battle brigade, who was, at that
moment, sipping tea instead of wormwood or
other Ouidaesque taps. Not that one has
any reason to gibe at this brilliant pen-
woman, except in the matter of her Greek
god heroes.

Smart She Set which now sometimes drives
abroad with its own husband, and is seen at
odd times in the Park with a child instead
of a lap-dog. The fashionable poodle and his

reduced —if the Mary boot remains long
enough on duty—to stealing a mutton-bone

Native Land Court (M.L.) Palmer and
his lady had to come back in two steamers
from the crowning uproar. Mr. Chief Judge
Palmer had a time limit to his leave, so his
lady was left to mend her fractured arm in
London under the eye of a brother. This
timely relative had hopped over from his
tea-caddy acreage in Assam, to see how
George looked in his new gold hat. The
Palmers were week-ending at the Duke of
Norfolk’s humpy, when Mrs. Palmer’s foot
tripped in a careless bit of stair-carpet. A
fractured arm caught in a ducal strawberry
patch, however, ought to come next in order
of precedence to a Maoriland Ward Baron-
etcy stuck together with new Court plaster.
Lord Dudley’s latest pirouette in Aus-
tralian politics is placed on the Worcester
stage, where ex-Governor Beauchamp rules
over 18,000 acres of turnip-tops and pumpkin
heads. Beauchamp, by the way, has never
hurled back answers at a 16,000 mile range,
and shows a more generous spirit to Aus-
tralian affairs than the unlamented Dudley,
who loved us not.
A Kindergarten spree, disguised as a
“game festival,” is going to stamp round
Rushcutter’s Bay Oval at the precise mo-
ment (or a tick later) that this meets your
eye—October 26.
Suggested In Memoriam verse on the de-
parture of a Mount Morganaire or other
heavy-weight bullionist: —
If thou art rich
Thou art poor,
For like an ass, whose back with ingots bows,
Thou bearest thy heavy riches but a journey,
And death unloads thee.
And blame Shakspeare for it, not me.
The Sydney Club which drew the first
breath of life a few months ago as a “Depot
of Arts and Domestic Economy,” or some-
thing equally long-winded, has given up the
ghost—under both labels —and rises to the
surface as “Australian Women’s Handi-
crafts.” The D.A.D.E., as a title, with
“Sydney Club” nailed on in front, had too
much head and tail, and the tail was trod-
den on at the Admiralty House scratch-
mittee meeting some weeks ago, while the
head retired in bandages, with a tear in its
visible eye. The result- —after cutting off
the head, “Sydney Club,” and burying the
tail, “D.A.D.E.”—is a brand that’s likely to
wear well,
“Emma Jane” trots out her grievance:
“The staircase trouble in the Town Hall,
when there’s a charity ball on the move,
needs plenty of daylight. Some ironclad
rule will have to be hurled at all comers,
warning dancers in the ballroom either to
stop there, or to crawl over the organ-stops,
if they want to get into the gallery. Here's
the trouble. Committees sell tickets for a
ball (which include an expensive supper),
say, at 10s. They sell gallery tickets at 2s.
or 2s. 6d, Persons who are cased in com-
plete brass fronts have disguised their armor
in evening dress, bought 2s. tickets, lingered
in the gallery till the 10s. supper tickets are
going to graze in the basement, slipped
downstairs and joined them —at the reduced
price of 25.”
“Emma Jane,” a veteran committee wo-
man, is on the side of the law when she
threatens to tear 10s. worth of drumstick
from the teeth of the 2s. ticket holder; but
she’s against order when she tacitly encour-
ages any official to dust the stairs with the
10s. lady, who wants to go up from the mazy
dance to the gallery. Every lady, even in
these days of reformed hip measurements,
isn’t small enough to squeeze through the
Town Hall organ pipes to the realms above.
Why not put perforated tags on the end of
ballroom tickets: “Please don’t chuck the
bearer downstairs.” There is no fee for this
advice.
While the galleryite in Her Majesty’s was
filling himself with patience and sandwiches,
the other afternoon, Mayor Allen Taylor
was rounding up the Town Hall corrob-
boree into gold-plated resolutions. At this
meeting, the T. H. Kelly suggestion of hand-
ing Melba a slab or two of bullion before
she left this patch-—as a loving cup memory
of her daring deed in shoving grand opera
across several seas to this port—was carried
by all hands. Melba has no hope of dodg-
ing an illuminated address.
The siege of Paling’s—by people who clam-
ored after gallery tickets for Juliet Melba
and Romeo McCormack —began at 3 a.m. on
Monday morning. By four it looked as if
this country’s most cherished institutions
were going to be upset. About five, all the
crowd wanted was a bloodstain and a pig-
tail, and it would have been a first-class
Chinese revolution. A little later, it was re-
ported that the Government forces inside
Paling’s were completely routed; all the
baggage and artillery were captured, and the
wreck of the management’s military re-
sources were short of provisions and ammu-
nition in a hill fort upstairs. Finally, the
Great Powers intervened by sending police
assistance. As a matter of fact, the crowd
rushed every inch of lane, gutter or kerb-
stone, dropped its hatpins, back combs, bags,
gloves (the feminine heel being on the war-
path), orange peel, etc., and stampeded for
the shop window. Comparative calm pre-
vailed at 9 a.m., when 3000 battering rams
melted away before the crack of doom—“ All
tickets sold.” The remains were swept up,
and weighed many tons.
Tenor Zeni’s Samson, in the opera of that
name, remains his best performance here,
and he wiped out the Philistines with im-
mense applause from Saturday night’s
packed herring-barrel audience. Samson
wears an auburn thatch of such magnificent
foliage that Delilah had to rush through a
record clip in about six bars of music, or
thereabouts.
Marshall-Hall’s “Brava” ought to be se-
curely housed in some special crib during
the Melbourne opera season, for the person
who happens to sit in front of it will yearn
to have his ears padded. The Marshall-Hall
hand-clap is like a volley of rifle shots, with
an extra bang when the “Brava” explodes
on a Melba night.
“Rigoletto,” like “Traviata,” set this harbor
in a mild flare. As Gilda, Melba goes upstairs
in the silvery trills of “Caro Nome,” like
a plump, grey thrush warbling to her nest.
John McCormack, as the Duke, makes his
first appearance in “Rigoletto,” also in grey
plumage. He often loses his hands in his
frills, and got rid of them for a second or
two, one night, by putting them through a
door. When John gets hurried on the stage,
he’s like a well-fed earthquake, and butts
into mere walls till they tremble at the
knees.
While the Melba opera folks are packing
up their baggage, and making remarks to the
same, in nine languages, it’s a line
to recall their grip on the rather tinselled
affections of “Society” in this town. At
the Mayor’s gorgeous evening dazzle, in
honor of Melba, tenor Zeni, basso Burke and
the majestic Eleanora de Cisneros were
rushed at by admirers.
Eleanora, who usually combs her front
mane down to meet her eyebrows in private
life, takes about the same amount of stuff
to make her frocks as the tall Austrian,
Marie Ranzenberg. Eleanora’s Count, and
his calves, as displayed in evening gear, and
his special design in hats—one hat-shop
here mentions with pride that it “modelled”
the Cuban nobleman’s headgear—and his
sarcastic smile, are likely to smite Cup week
festivities with the same buoyancy that
marked their float on these waters.
Scandiani is soaked in an atmosphere of
opera, and seems hard to snare for private
parties. The Mrs. Leo Hunter who wants
this lion to roar for her friends at feeding-
time will have to stalk him with wary
tread. Baritone Scandiani, by the way,
can talk tramways as well as tragic song,
he was an engineer, and knows all the elec-
tric jars and jolts in Milan’s tram service.
He hasn’t expressed his opinion as to the
best way to fall off an overcrowded car in
this city.
The Italian love of animals, which even
boils down to a mild devotion to bacon in
the raw, was assuaged by a motor sprint to
Hawkesbury College the other day. Mrs.
Rava (a sister of Scandiani) and her son
were the guests of Mr. Marich for the trip,
and with them went the French-Canadian,
Albert Quesnel, also of the Pitt-street avi-
ary. On the way up, the motor drank in
more petrol or otnerwise rested itself, in the
grounds of the Durham homestead, Kamila-
roi, near ancient Richmond. The sporting
Durhams are also floral in their tastes, and
the motor left for the experimental piggeries
with a waggon-load of roses overlapping its
tyres.
The farewell concert to Mrs. Slapoffski
threatens to overflow the Town Hall on Nov-
ember 22, and the talent that has laid itself
on the doorstep of 'the departing singer in-
cludes nearly every voice-box of note in this
hamlet.
The Maori troupe is expected to strike
this beach in December, to meet the re-
marks of the Sydney syndicate which backed
its trip to the Cold Land, and saw it safely
through the Sydney and Melbourne flutter.
Business at Clontarf was heavily rained on,
but it cleared up, with good results, in the
Cabbage Patch. The syndicaters, men of
solid commercial standing, weren’t going to
spoil the ship for the sake of a penn’orth of
tar, so they saw the haka through the
“White City” end of their show. Now they
keep an open mind to inquire into methods
of management on the other side. At the
same time, that mind is not pledged to re-
main open indefinitely, and, if it slams, it
may slam very hard. It’s alleged that “gross
extravagance” is one testimonial the syndi-
cate will heave at the returned wanderers.
The Society of Women Painters got into
the backwash of the R.A. Society’s hanging
party, and other social splashes, when it
hammered in its picture hooks for a mid-
October meeting—to be pulled out till No-
vember 11 —in the Vickery’s Chambers art
attics. And it has had to fall back on the
same old institution —the teapot—to keep
itself in pocket. Mrs. James Ashton (who
remarks that she’d rather have pushed the
show along with some other weapon), Mrs.
Langer Owen, and Miss Ethel Stephens, are
prepared to pour the damp substance, which
comes from where the insurrection is, down
the throats of all comers on October 26.
The Women’s Picture Show is worth see-
ing on its merits. The sign of the axe is
indicated in the large number of paintings
that must have been chopped off the list
and carted back to their owners before open-
ing day. Ethel Nicholls’s “Noah’s Ark,”
in water-colors, would be a good design for
the Christmas supplement the illustrated
weeklies often fail to find. Mary Stod-
dard’s “Companions,” in oils, gets away
from the obviously cheerful, to the dismal.
The subject is a young organ-grinder catch-
ing cold in the snow, with a dejected monkey
who’s on the same beat. This effort got
hon. mention in the Franco-British Exhibi-
tion, and butts into the old pot-boiler argu-
ment : Is it better to be honorably men-
tioned, or not to be mentioned at all, except
as “Sold”?
Any tip is good enough when it is the
right tip. While the hoofs were taking an
airing in the saddling paddock, at the recent
spring sweeping, a feminine person was also
taking exercise with her brother. She says:
“A bunch of my curls fell off, and a groom,
who was leading a horse near us, sheepishly
picked them up and handed them to me.
We looked at the gee-gee’s number, and
found his name began with C (Colma), and
promptly backed him, chiefly because my
curls began with C. We won £20.” This
story should add that the groom’s name was
Cohen; but, then, very few grooms are called
Cohen.
Chappell and Co. forward a small moun-
tain or music—chiefly song. Cora Fabri’s
charming trifle, “There’s a Bird Beneath
Your Window,” is mounted by Liza Leh-
mann, with her usual graceful lilt, when
she’s on the track of ballad music. S. Liddle
has written a softly-flowing melody to carry
Gunby Hadath’s verses, “A Pearl for Every
Tear.” The oyster will continue to weep
in secret, and human tears will be collected
in the handkerchief as of old and sent to the
wash as pearls of no market value.
The stamp collector raged through the re-
cent Philatelic Congress. He or she wore the
usual hungry look that marks all collectors —
from the dog-tax man who’s looking for the
half-crown that’s barking in the back yard,
to the. collector of stars who goes out shoot-
ing with a big telescope—when the exhibi-
tion of stamps was opened in the King’s
Hall last week. The person who collects
stamps over the . G.P.O. counter will, how-
ever, go on licking them in the same un-
hygienic way, without worrying for the
water-line that runs a twopenny stamp into
the fancy price of £lOO.
May your Cup be full of cash.

While the gentleman is waiting on the doormat, it

club exists only for matrimonial purposes. The young

his lawful wedlocking. There is no subsequent an-

“Down with Immorality.” The sympathy of all good

That the hand of our old friend, Mr. Davis, has not lost its cunning is proved
beyond doubt by “The Book of Dan,” which has just been published.
Dan, the son of Dad, has grown to man’s estate, and developed many humorous
peculiarities, which land him in particularly tight corners, out of which he generally
manages to extricate himself like a veritable Napoleon of the Bush. Dan is a
“character,” and his sense of humor is not always the same as the other fellow’s, but
It will assuredly tickle the reader to tears.
Of this book there is no doubt; it is bound to become a favorite.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, October 23, 1911.
My Dear Yarrie, —
A cold, windy Wednesday for the V.A.T.C.
mid-week meeting thinned out the gaudy
butterflies and wasps of Society at Caul-
field. It was a man’s day; but an occa-
sional male was obsexwed escorting a blue-
nosed female or two, or searching for a
refuge for his charges in the empty stand.
Governor Fuller, with a retinue of aides,
was present in a costume which included a
light coat and spats. At'the end of the day,
he was observed twirling his cane, and al-
most prancing over the grass; the general
opinion was that his animal, whatever it
was, had got home first.
The Caulfield Cup has an almost unbroken
fine weather record, and blue skies, balmy
breezes and- sunshine kept the average in-
tact on Saturday. A huge crowd was the
last ingTedient of a big success. The stands
were packed full all the day, people who had
secured seats being content to sit tight and
watch the races and the passing show. It
was a great day, but the crowd was too big
for the effective showing of fine clothes. The
vice-regal pen, so often deserted of late,
could have done with a House Full placard,
all the Excellencies and their suites being
along. They went to tea in the rose-covered
house beyond the carriage paddock in twos.
Lord Dick Nevill made his first public ap-
pearance here since his return, and lent an
attentive ear to little Roma Clarke, who was
garbed in a blue dress and hat to match.
Lady Denman wore a wreath of roses, a
shady hat and a short frock. The whole
party, with the exception of the Fuller lady,
departed from the usual practice, and stayed
till'the very end of the day. Her Ex. of
Victoria—a very fair vision in a. lettuce-
green dress —departed early with Aide Awdry
in one of the yellow gas engines. In the tea
procession, Auntie Phipps showed up vividly
against the green grass in a royal blue silk
dress placarded with squares of gold and
black. Miss Quirk wore a Quality-street
gown with a little silk purse bag to match.
The two Governors and all the aides got
under glittering top hats for this occasion;
at the earlier meetings, comfortable tweeds
and headgear to suit w r as good enough fox*
them.
Mrs. Holden gave a tea party on Caul-
field Cup day, and hostessed in a cool-look-
ing dress of black and white and a big black
hat.
Every second woman on the lawn hung a
sort of mosquito net over her head. Gen-
erally they were of black or white and em-
bellished with realistic flies and- beetles.
Pretty Lady Barttelot was one of those who
hid their good looks. Her disguise was sus-
pended from a taking fuchsia-covered hat.
Hamlet B. Irving was observed striding
about with a huge coral skull in his tiepin.
The one lie uses in the play is too large for
outdoor use.
The woolly McKellars, of the Western
District, had a luxurious tea party. Mrs.
Fisken wore blue and white stripes. Clarkes
were sprinkled all over the lawn. The two
girls of the late Janet’s branch of the family
were clothed like the lilies of the field. Mrs.
Reggie Power (former]y Clarke) also wore
simple white. Mrs. Clive Baillieu, just
back from Fogland, sported a smart blue
dress. The tunic of the moment gave sev-
ei'al of the charmers the appearance of being
wrapped in discarded bed curtains, and
some remarkable flapping tails were in evi-
dence. Some of the flappers now frock as
smartly as full-grown women, and probably
have bills to match.
The woman with a prominent nose should
carefully avoid the latest hat with the laCe
wings. Some of the examples seen during
the Caulfield meeting made their large-
nosed wearers resemble cockatoos and
eagles.
Caulfield race Saturdays are times of
trial for the suburbanite who lives out that
way, and for the people who want to get to
the beaches and picnic places that lie be-
yond the horsey district. The strings of
race trains hold up the ordinary traffic in
an infuriating way, delays of an hour being
fairly frequent. And an hour in, a stuffy
carriage, when the waves and trees are call-
ing, is enough to make the mildest young
man lean out of the carriage window and
brain a passing bookmaker with the picnic
billy.
On Thursday, the Gentlewomen’s Aid
Society held its annual sale in the Prahran
Town Hall, with the motorocracy buzzing
about the good work. Lady Fuller baulked
the opening ceremony at the last moment,
on the ground that her medical adviser
would not authorise the outing. Whereat
the crowd that had coveted her smile
groaned inwardly. It was hard luck for the
society, as a vice-regal Presence helps the
sale of tickets, and makes things hum like a
bee 12ft. long. Two Judges’ ladies —a’Bec-
kett and Holroyd—and the widow Staugh-
ton did their best to help the show in its
hour of need. Mrs. Drought managed a
stall, and Miss Secretary Flower acted as
commander-in-chief, with Miss White as
chief-of-staff. Miss White’s mother, by the
way, was the society’s first president 20
years ago. On her death, Mrs. Grimwade
stepped to the fore. Mrs. McDevitt has
charge of the exchange in the Block. The
old ladies the society helps are incapable of
disposing of the beautiful things they make,
several of them being blind, and most of the
others incapacitated in various ways. They
are all dainty fingered, and knit, mend and
make lovely items in underwear —things that
the proverbial princess woqld wear with :
secret satisfaction, so to speak. They will
supply anything, from'lace and'whole trous-
seaux to jars of home preserves and home-
made cake. In fact, the Poor Gentlewomen
are universal providers waiting for aidful
orders.
Whilst the country shows, are on, Gover-
nor Fuller might study up the names of his
towns in advance, or else relegate the duty
to an aide with a good prompter’s voice. At
Warracknabeal, the other day, his Ex. made
the awful mistake of calling the place Warr-
nambool. Being corrected in an agonised
stage whisper, Fuller scrambled along the
whole length of the thing from “W” to “1.”
Tnere was no one at his elbow to tell him ■to
use the handy local abbreviation of “War-,
rack.” Many of the native names are appal-
ling things in their wild, orthographic state;
but there is generally an abridged edition in
universal use. And if the person from over-
seas uses it easily, the oldest inhabitant’s,
heart is warmed, and’he gets ready to cheer
at the first opportunity.
The Try Boys’ ball, held on the eve of
the Caulfield Cup, was a little bit frost-
bitten. The Naicest were in evidence, but
Lady Denman was unable to get back from
Sydney in time, and Governor Fuller had to
come without his lady. Auntie Phipps, how-
ever, came along, and a devoted quartette
of aides danced in her footsteps. The Mad-
den lady wore turquoifees in a new tiara,';
and more tux - quoises in her black and white;
dress. There were some fancy-dress sets,,;
and Miss Phipps wore her black-and-white’
magpie get-up. The official sets suffered
somewhat. Lady Fuller had to cancel at the
eleventh hour, and the carefully assorted
party had to wait a long time for pretty!
Mrs. Fairbairn,’whose taxi or motor became,
ill on the way. Brassbound naval men cut:
out the drylanders, and a lot of them had to
drape themselves along the wall, for, won-;
. derful to tell, there were too many men.
Amongst those who, stood by was the Gaud
Mayor himself. Tenor Kirby wailed loudly;
at the lack of partners. Mrs. Major Mauser'
waited aside from the dancing whirl,for her 1
husband, who was detained at Queenscliff by!
military duties. The Cresswell Admiraless;
was placed next 1 to, Lieutenant-Colonel Sel-‘
heim’s dame, who wore a tunic over a flame-
colored dress. Gaud Mayoress' Mrs. Davey;
was in silver and white. The Fall was not
packed hard enough to make the Try Boys
turn handsprings; but the final adding up,
may put a brighter finamcial look on the
affair.
Colin Campbell, of the delicate com-
plexion, is showing off the fiancee he lately [
attached in N.S.W. She is over for all the:
Cup-time, revels, and danced in the Puritan
set at the Try Boys’ dance.
Peterson, who is, spreading a knowledge
of physical culture through the continent,
last week a number of girl punils
to give a display. A small army of young
persons, in the cutest of short frocks, an-
swered the roll-call. Two of the young
Amazons glided about in rubber gymnasium
shoes and showed the visitors to their seats.
Then a small girl crashed out some well-
timed music and the exercises started.
Amongst other things, two maidens fenalit
a sort of duel with foils. No less than five
Governors have commanded Peterson to
prescribe exercises for them. It is believed
that all Excellencies have to train, specially
for their banquets. It is only occasionally
that a natural table athlete of the George
Reid stamp arises.
The Prahran Mayoral Emblings gave an,
informal At Home the other day, which the
Gaud Mayoress attended. During the mild’
function, "heaps of congratulations were re-
ceived by the hostess’s sister, Miss, Mackie,
who is just now busy trousseau and house-
hunting. Mr. Black is the lucky man.
Rather a smart little afternoon was given
to the dancing Hyams by their young pupils
in the Masonic Hall, Middle Brighton, dur-
ing the week. The kiddies, who wore fancy
frocks, pirouetted .firstly, and entertained
their instructresses afterwards at tea. In
this they were aided and abetted by numer-
ous mammas, amongst whom were Mrs.
Harvie Hamilton, Mrs. Lempriere, Mrs.
Nankivell, Mrs. Travers, Mrs. Willie Moule
and others.
The Victorian Artists were At Home
quite brilliantly, in the Athenseum, on Sat-
urday evening. Secretary Colquhoun stage-
managed the affair, and Mrs. McCubbin
hostessed gracefully. At 10. o’clock, white
clad tables, decorated with pink roses, seemed
to spring from nowhere; then refreshments
sprang on to them ; finally, the guests sprang
at the refreshments. So far as hairdressing
is concerned, the Victorian girl artist comes
a cropper; but her gowns are generally all
right. Of the women present, Mrs. Janson
looked smartest in a red frock.
The Fullers are going to vary the monot-
ony usual to' the vice-regal round by a com-
paratively select moonlight garden party, on
November 1.
Last week one of the Fuller bairns had a
birthday, and there was a party in honor of
the event —not a large official function, but
a gathering of some 30 first-class juveniles,
interspersed with grown-ups. An item in the
merry-making that thrilled the kiddies and
charmed t.ieir chaperones was Maud Gran-
tham’s telling of tales from “Alice,” and
stories from Kipling’s “Just So” series. For
the better half of an hour Miss Grantham
held the party suspended on her w r ords.
Tne Continuation School held its anhual
sports, at the Fitzroy Cricket Ground, last
Friday. The bright particular gem of the
programme was the display of Old English
Folk Games by a regular army of sweet and
blushful . girls, who were dressed in pastel
frocks with muslin sunbonnets and aprons.
Six bashful slie-fiddlers in smock frocks and
slouch hats preceded the players, and sup-
plied the music for the games that followed
the stepping.
One of Melbourne’s popular hostesses,
Mrs. Harvie Hamilton, is leaving for Eng-
land next year, and taking her chick with
her.
Mrs. Malleson, at one time known as the
best-dressed woman in Melbourne, has been
in bad health of late, and unable to go into
society. However, society, whenever it is
allowed to, goes to her. The lady still re-
tains her fine figure, and the tea gowns and
things she wears as an invalid are well
worth gloating over.
The lately-widowed Mrs. Alec Landale is
now on her way back to Australia. She will
be met at Colombo by Gordon, the youngest
hope of the family. . .
James Cuming, of' Cuming, Smith and
Co., who died rich the other day, studied
agricultural chemistry in liis' youth, when
very few tillers of the soil worried about-the
scientific aspect of their calling. When
James came to Australia; back in ’62,- and
cast his trained eye over the wheat-growing
country, he realised that, it would not take
many years to exhaust the phosphates in the
young soil. His earliest attempts to sell
superphosphate were mostly laughed at, the
wheat growers of that time being confident
they could do very well \yithout. Nowa-
days, very little whept is grown in Australia
on the old, haphazard lines; the superphos-
phate is drilled in with the seed, and the
superphosphate industry is a very big thing,
the Cuming-Smith factory at Footscray oc-
cupying 50 acres and employing 300 work-
men. Some years ago, the founder of the
business gave £lOOO to Dookie College. The
University also received £lOOO for chemical
research, and a similar sum for veterinary
science, the man of superphosphates having
once been a farrier in Australia. His cheque
book was a spring of benevolence much re-
lied upon by hospital secretaries and others
interested in “homes” and such. He leaves
four sons to carry on the business and three'
married daughters—Mrs. Frank Sharp, Mrs.
Edward Campbell and Mrs. Andrew
Stewart. , .
The. death of Mrs. Hodson last week came .
as a great shock to her relatives and friends.
The hospitable Toorakian dame was booked
for a trip to Europe after the Cup season.
Mrs. Ted Tait, who has been leading a
secluded existence in hospital for nearly a
year, is just beginning to receive visitors.
Nervous prostration has been the trouble.
Cyril "Tyler, the full-chested boy soprano,
who, in years of yore, silenced a Melbourne
discussion re his sex, is ndw > growing into a
nice soldier man at West Point, U.S.A. His
voice is said to have developed into a lovely
tenor. When Melbourne knew him, he had
a waist like a girl, and roused the curiosity
of medical men by a way he had of singing
above the diaphrhgm. Since that time, Melba
has demolished the old hour-glass idea of
feminine voice-production. Strong-man Clar-
ence Weber, by the way, prbfesses to ex-
plain,, by physical demonstration, just how
the great singer gets her phenomenal notes.
An engagement that has just been cried
from the housetops in the approved manner
is that of Netta Brandt to Robert Edward
(commonly known as "'Ted”) Lewis, of the
Lewis‘and .-Whi tty "clan.
If you happen to be going to Paris, please
paste this address in your hatbox : Mrs. de la
Invenie. 7 liue d’Antin (opposite the
Champs* ElysSes). Quite a number of Cor-
onation pilgrims who stayed there and were
made comfortable, have asked me to spread
the news. The cheerful and capable hostess
is a Tasmanian girl, who, years ago, married
a French railway engineer. Some time
after their marriage, he had the misfortune
to be crippled for life in a lift accident,
and his plucky wife started this pension
famille. Agents-General McCall, of las-
mania, and Taverner, of Victoria, the Tav-
erner lady and the Tasmanian senators who ,
did the Coronation trip, all put up at No.
7, and speak of it glowingly.
From my Adelaide correspondent: —
Our ambassadors of commerce played their annual
Fancy Dress Football Match, at Adelaide Oval, on
Saturday. The attair resulted in a haul of £ 12,000
for charities —a big advance on the first match, in
1907, when £l5O was netted. W. E. McDermott
disguised himself as a flower girl, and did a roar-
ing trade. On the night before the match the
bagmen fed together, and afterwards such notables
as the Governor and members of the Ministry
A Yorkshire Society bloomed in our midst the
other dav, and last week it held its inaugural smoke
social. Ex-Mayor Frank Johnson was in the chair,
and Superintendent Owen Smyth supplied what is
known —I believe —as the “stingo.” He murmured
something about punching someone’s head, at Lox-
ton or Oodnadatta, or somewhere, but, so far, none
but oratorical gore appears to have been spilled.
Our Society of Arts is rejoicing over the N.S.W.
success of Miss H. A. and Miss M. Hambidge.
They have, scored a good many commissions, and have
. had their wofik gladly accepted by the Royal Syd-
ney Art Society, and each has sold a canvas to the
N. S. Wales Gallery. By the way, the Society of
Arts, at its annual meeting, removed Mr. H. P. Gill
from his long-held position of president, and in-
stalled Mr. Davies in his place. The election is
probably an echo of the violent strife which has
been raging round the society in general.
The Lyric Club witnessed a special turn-out of the
Fire Brigade on Friday evening. There was a biggish
crowd of members and their guests, and the verdict
was that the art of fire extinguishing has its points
of interest, no less than that of classical and other
music.
Bowls, that grand, reckless old game, or excuse
for a convivial life, or whatever it may be called,
is once more with us. The St. Peter’s green was for-
mally opened t’other day, to the music of afternoon
tea-cups, supplied, by President and Mrs. Hall.
From England comes good news of Miss Isabel
Stuckey, one of an old S. Australian family, who’s
been spending her time in London, and, incidentally,
studying music. Her master is he who drilled Amy
Castles, and a recent Continental paper contained
high praise of the Adelaide girl’s voice.
Talking of music, Elsie Hall, who, 10 years
ago, taught, the piano at the Elder Conservatorium,
and who is now busy imparting scales and things
to Princess Mary, has decided to give a turn at a
London music-hall o’ nights.
At the Elder Conservatorium concert, on Monday
night, Professor Winsloe Hall made his first appear-
ance as a conductor. When he wasn’t wielding the
baton Harold Parsons was, so the audience had
variety. One item on the programme was a song-
cycle, “A Garden of Flowers.” It is Mr. and Mrs.
Hall’s own composition, and met with an excellent
reception.
Among those who leave shortly for the Durbar are
Miss Amy Lea and her cousin, Miss Williams, the
Kidmans (of cattle fame), and Aide-de-camp Captain
Fletcher. Talking of departures, that of the Stock-
bridges was hasty at the last. An offer came of
good work in Canada, and they’ve set sail for the
Dominion instead of London.
The Church pageant eventuated on Wednesday
night—with varying success. For one thing, many of
the performers’ voices were about as weak as the
acoustic properties of the Exhibition, where the show
was held, so to the bulk of the audience a good part
of the affair' was dumb show. In all, there were
five scenes, representing different stages in the intro-
duction of Christianity into Great Britain, and the
period covered was from 550 to 680. The bulk of
the work fell on Mr. von Truer, as stage manager,
and architect Guy Makin, who, with Miss Phillips,
designed the dresses and “properties.” These were
wonderfully effective. Miss Isabel Young was re-
sponsible for the success of the dances. Between the
scenes appeared a cleric, officially dubbed the “Ex-
plicator,” who recited a poem explaining what was
happening. The funds go to bulge the coffers of the
Bishop’s Home Mission Society—and Government
House did what it could to ensure success by turning
up and looking as though it was enjoying itself.
An indignant young man writes about the
unfairness of the press in attacking the
young Flinders-lane men for their alleged
want of morals, while some of the ragtime
■elders stand so badly in need of advice and
•guidance. lie tells a lurid story of the do-
ings of a softgoods director, who keeps his
wife and pretty daughters on a very moder-
ate scale in one State, while he heaps lux-
uries on a fair-liaired lady who lives over
the border and beyond the pale. The only
way for the young Lane man to escape cen-
sure, whether he deserves it or not, is to be-
come a softgoods director at the first oppor-
tunity.
Melbourne is not so beautiful that it can
afford to overlook any etched views of the
city and thereabouts. Victor Cobb is re-
sponsible for some nice little bits, which
have seemingly been done to the order of a
local pictdre dealer. A view up the Yarra.
looking towards Melbourne, is clever in the
etching, and altogether effective, also a some-
, what larger picture of Princes Bridge,
viewed from the south-east bank of the
murky stream. The fault in this is the old-
fashioned arrangement of a floridly decora-
tive foreground. The artist has tried to
make the subject too pretty, but this is a
struggle in the right direction, anyhow.
The kitchen tea, to which the guests come
laden with gifts of brooms and cooking
utensils, is no longer exclusively the function
of the prospective bride. Two ladies re-
cently invested in a slice of mountain side,
and erected thereon a holiday fastness. A
few nights later, the quiet suburban street
where they live was invaded by a straggling
army of friends carrying the contents of
four kitchens, seven laundries and a scullery
or two. An American broom was the stand-
ard borne aloft by the vanguard; the clank
of swinging buckets almost drowned the
noise of shunting trains ; iron pots protruded
from brown paper wrappings and smote well-
wishers on the chin with their handles; and
egg whisks fell at intervals and bounced on
the pavement. The most original warrior
bore a neat and precious packet of fire-
kindlers, and about half a squad were armed
with toasting-forks. The handy three-
pronged weapon cannot be too numerous
when a snake takes crawling exercise under
the canvas walls of the holiday cottage.
Sincerely yours,
JOHANNA.

A NEW REMEDY.
The old friends of Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy
will be pleased to know that the manufacturers of
this preparation have gotten out a new remedy for
biliousness and all disorders of the stomach, liver
and bowels. It is called Chamberlain’s Tablets, and
has met with great success in the treatment of con-
stipation, biliousness, sick headache, impaired diges-
tion and liver disorders. It is easy to take, and
more pleasant in effect than pills. Chamberlain’s
Tablets not only move the bowels but improve the
appetite and correct any disorders of the stomach
and liver. This is certain to be one of the most
nopular medicines in use, and everyone who uses it
is pleased with the prompt relief it affords.*

A WAY TO CURE
RHEUMATISM
How to Get Rid of the Cause
of the Complaint.
♦
A treatment for Rheumatism that aims
at driving out of the system the cause of
the complaint is certainly the commonsense
way of dealing with the disease. Acid in
the blood is recognised by many authorities
as the cause of the trouble. It has been
found that when this acid has been driven
from the system that Rheumatism is cured.
Treatment of Rheumatism with Dr. Wil-
liams’ Pink Pills has been remarkably suc-
cessful because they actually make new
blood, building up the system to a point that
enables it to throw off the Rheumatic
poison.
Miss A. Fletcher, Hay Street, Subiaco,
Perth, has been cured of Rheumatism by Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills, and her statement to a
reporter should be of interest to other suf-
ferers.
“I caught a heavy cold, which settled on
me, and then Rheumatism set in,” said Miss
Fletcher. “It started in both legs and
spread as far as my knees, and afterwards it
affected my arms. I would be in bed for
several days, and then I’d get about with a
stick. I could not bend my knees they
wer° so stiff. I suffered acute darting pains
all through my limbs. I couldn’t use my
hands, they were so knotted in the fingers.
I had to sit about the house all day, I
couldn’t get about except by hobbling. I
had nagging pains all the time. I was
suffering for about six months when a lady
friend told me to try Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills. I got some from one of the West
Perth grocers, and the first box helped me.
I started with one pill after each meal, and
it only needed two boxes to drive the Rheu-
matism completely out of my system. The
stiffness and soreness began to go out of
my knees. I began to get about without
the aid of a stick and the use of my hands
came back. I’ve not had a trace of them
since Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills cured me.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are good for any
complaint that a supply of rich, red blood
is good for, but one needs to be careful to
get the genuine, as substitutes sometimes
offered are useless. They are sold by most
chemists and storekeepers, price 2/9 per
box; six boxes 15/3, or if they cannot be
obtained locally will be sent post free on
receipt of price by the Dr. Williams Medi-
cine Co. of Australasia Ltd., Sydney.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The Dago is a good shot with his mouth,
whatever may be liis other failings. Judging
by the way he is dashing ultimatums about, it
looks as if the Unspeakable Turk would
soon have no territory left —on paper, that
is. The plaintiff is not only going to keep
Tripoli and Cyrenaica, if the Tripolitans
will let him; but to take —‘temporarily or
permanently—some of the islands of the
Archipelago and to exact an indemnity. The
last sounds hopeless. Taking the fez off a
Highlander is nothing to it.
AS ’TWAS IN THE BEGINNING—AND
EVER SHALL BE!
A familiar drama.
Thus D. C, McLachlan, the Common-
wealth Public Service Commissioner:—
Viewing the matter as a public servant of many
years’ standing, with a full knowledge of the condi-
tions operating throughout the States’ services prior
to Federation, I have no hesitation in reiterating the
statement that at no period in the history of public
service administration in Australia has the general
contentment of the service, represented by the
transferred departments, been greater than at the
present time.
Which shows exactly what was to be ex-
pected under Labor administration in the
Commonwealth. The Bulletin thought all
along it would come to this, but like the
Sydney Telegraph, Melbourne Argus, Bris-
bane Courier and other family journals, it
didn’t mention it.
The S. Aus. Labor Government can only
just manage to kick the beam; and if (as is
feared) Speaker Coles does not return to
the chair, and Deputy-Speaker Jackson
moves up to it, the party will be left with-
out a statutory majority in respect to Con-
stitutional amendment Bills, for, including
Jackson, it has only 21 votes in a House of
40. Coombe (who is a party by himself)
helped the Laborites to pass the Legislative
Council Veto Bill through the Assembly, but
he is against adult suffrage for the Council,
and that is why it has not been brought for-
ward this session.
Burgoyne, who has sat in the S. Aus.
Assembly for 2,1 years, speaking about E.
L. Batchelor’s death, said : “He was one of
the few men I have met since I entered Par-
liament whom I could respect and esteem
highly.” Even in the most strenuous politi-
cal struggles, Batchelor was as courteous as
he was firm. It fell to his lot once (in
1599) to tell Kingston, then Premier, that
if he persisted in a certain course, the Labor
party (of which Batchelor was leader)
would vote against him ; and he got through
even that ordeal without offending King-
ston, who, however, was bitterly hurt at the
ultimatum.
A POLITICIANS SON.
PARSON : “ Where do you pick up such lurid
language , my bov?”
BOY: "In HANSARD."
John Weary, Victoria’s
nominal Premier, has re-
turned from his Coronation
jaunt filled with bubbling
sympathy for the “poor,
dear, old land.” “Millions of
Britisher s,” he told his
Warrnambool banqueteers,
“are little better than serfs.
Let them come to Australia,
and they will be in every
sense men.” Well, it won’t
be the fault of Weary’s
Government if they are.
Bull’s mania for giving his
work to foreigners is the
chief cause of his troubles,
and Weary and Co. have
only lately given proof 'of
the same form of insanity
by handing to foreigners or-
ders for railway motors,
railway engines, steel rails,
dredges and other skilled
and profitable work that
ought to be done by Aus-
tralians.
It is bad enough for the rough, rude
unionist to knock off work himself; but
when he prevents others from working,
every Fatman knows that the thing is an
outrage on the sacred liberty of the subject
—“and gaol’s too good for ’em, sir; far too
good!” Under these circumstances. The
Bulletin dreads to think what the Fatman
should do to his henchman Wood, of the
N.S.W. Assembly, who, with some follow-
ers, has been struggling for weeks to pre-
vent any work being done by the Govern-
ment. And in the Victorian House of Rich
Landlords, the other night, the very Fat
Abbott, being unable to get his way over a
matter, hung up business for the whole
evening by taking points, calling for divi-
sions, and adopting other devices. Abbott
was not only on strike himself, but, like Fat’s
friends in the Ma State, he was picketing
the legislative mill, and doing exactly what
Fat says should be punished with something
worse than gaol. Yet, if a Laborite sug-
gested that Wood and Abbott should even
be gaoled, they would probably reply that
it was more of the vulgar person’s con-
founded impudence.
The Argus, throwing its usual wet blan-
ket on the Government’s proposal to estab-
lish a Commonwealth State Bank, says:—
What is to be deprecated is not the creation of
another commercial banking establishment, but one
of political lineage, sure to be swayed by its paren-
tage into uncertain and dangerous courses.
As a matter of fact, one great difference be-
tween the private and the State banks of
Australia is that there is scarcely a private
bank which hasn’t got a few politicians on
its Board, while there isn’t a State bank
which has got so much as one politician
among its managing trustees. The oldest of
the State concerns is the one in S. Aus., and
when its accounts were made up last year,
though it had been trading since 1895, only
£4363 of principal and £249 of interest were
in arrear, and the balance-sheet didn’t show
one single foreclosed property on hand.
News item from Maoriland (19/10/T1) :
The Loan Bill passed the House of Representa-
tives. An amendment for striking £200,000 from
the schedule as an indication that there was too
much borrowing was defeated by 45 votes to 8.
The Nose bad it, as usual.
Before the Labor party gets office Fat
calls it a confiscator of private property.
After it has reached office, the ’Enleys and
other “Liberals” demand that it be crucified,
not for confiscating property, but for over-
paying Fat for the trifle of property it
takes from him.
Josiah Thomas, who hasn’t been a con-
soicuous success at the Post Office, passes on
to the External Affairs Department, the
head whereof was cut off by the death of E.
L. Batchelor. The Post Office is a big,
hustling business concern, and Thomas isn’t
a hustler, and never could be a commercial
success. His plans were all right, as a rule,
but he wasn’t the man to carry them into
elfect. Frazer, of Westralia, the youngster
of the Ministry, who sat at the Treasury
while Fisher was Coronating, follows
Thomas at the Post Office, and the whip will
be heard cracking oftener now.
A certain Lord Avebury has written to the
London Times saying that the cause of
peace will be thrown back 100 years unless
Turkey and Italy refer the Tripoli shindy
to the Hague Arbitration Tribunal. But —
well, supposing Turkey were to arbitrate
about giving up its province 'of Tripoli,
would Britain arbitrate about giving
independence to its old stolen island of Ire-
land, and handing back Egypt, and allowing
absolute self-government to India? Pro-
bably not, even though the cause of
peace was thereby thrown back into
the middle of the sea. Only a
few years ago, when Britain wanted the
Transvaal, its simple attitude was : “To the
Devil with arbitration!” And that is the
trouble every time. It always has been the
trouble.
Levien, M.L.A., father of the N.S.W. As-
sembly, who is always struggling with his
Totalisator Bill, and never getting much
further, recommends the tote this time on
the ground that it could easily be made to
yield £300,000 a year for hospitals and such
like. The Bulletin reckons it is time to
throw that gag overboard. In the first
place, hospitals ought to be maintained by
taxation, the same as the civil service, and
should not depend on any casual or unreli-
able side-line like totes and Hospital Satur-
days. In the second place, the tote doesn’t
need to apologise for its existence by pro-
fessing that its profits are specially ear-
marked for the benefit of the poor and suf-
fering. The bookmaker, whom the McGowen
Government doesn’t even attempt to sup-
press, makes no show of justifying his ex-
istence by supporting any narticular hospi-
tal. nor does the solicitor, or the share-
broker, or the wild-eatter. The tote can
challenge comparison with any and all of
these for respectability. If the money de-
rived from it went straight into the Trea-
sury, that institution wouldn’t suffer. The
coin would be more resnecfahle than the
money derived from drink and tobacco du-
ties, fines on wife-beaters, and a hundred
other sources of revenue.
THE LATE E. L. BATCHELOR.
Boothby, the district for which E. L.
Batchelor sat in the Reps., returns five
Labor members to the S.A. State Parlia-
ment. The only two contested Federal elec-
tions there, during the last 10 years, were won
by Batchelor, one from ex-Premier Solomon
and the other from Paris Nesbit, K.O.
There is sure to be a big fight on the present
occasion, for the “Liberals” think they can
carry the seat, though, at the last State
elections, there were about 1000 votes be-
tween the highest “Liberal” defeated and
the lowest Labor man returned.
FEDERAL
MINISTER
FRASER.
“The Gallery
Hand” writes:
W. H. Wood,
M.L.A., who has
lately been in a
chronic state of
being emptied out
of Ma’s Assembly,
would probably
have been leader
of the Opposition
after the “Liber-
als” were beaten
at the last elec-
tion, but for his
incurable aggres-
siveness and offen-
si v e “flashness.”
There is no doubt
that a consider-
able section of the
party was full up
to the neck of
Calamity Wade,
and, if there had
been any other
po s s ible leader,
out “ Sporting ”
Greg o ry would
have gone; but
there wasn’t.
Wood, although a
better politician at
bottom than any
of them, had long
ago spoilt any
chance he had of
the leadership of
any party; Wad-
dell is politically
moribund, and the
rest are drifting
about the same lo-
cality. Can’t un-
derstand Wood.
Privately, he is a
pleasant-spoken individual, with none of that
bully-in-the-playground spirit which he exhibits in
Parliament, and which would ruffle the feathers of
an assembly of bald angels. 1 could be induced by
(say) Carnegie to forgive him his bad-tempered as-
sertiveness, but nothing will reconcile me to his
habit of turning his eyes up to one or other of the
galleries, in search of applause, after an exhibition
of it. Some night, when he is doing that, I’ll pour
the ink into his nearest optic, or drop half
a pound of refreshment-room butter on his Family
Herald hair arrangement. All the same, I don’t
agree with those who say that Wood wrecked the
Wade Ministry. It would have been wrecked just as
surely and rapidly if he hadn’t been a member of it,
but I must admit that he is doing his bit to keep
it permanently on the scrap-heap, and, if he never
does anything else for the country, he’ll deserve a
general vote of thanks for that much.
THE LUNCHERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Where municipal government is as stodgy and un-
enterprising as it has long been in the Melbourne me-
tropolitan area, there seems to be something almost
invidious in criticising any manifestation of a
quickened spirit.— Argus.
The eat lies dead beside the kerb
Throughout the long, warm, perfumed day,
And fails for ever to disturb
The peace of councils, grave and gay,
Where councillors, contented, crunch
Assorted chicken-bones, at lunch.
The hot dust rises all around
The simple, slow, ratepaying soul,
Who stumbles now on holey ground
To reach his out-suburban goal;
And, while he wipes his cindered eye,
Far off, the water-cart goes by.
Up hill and down, designed for us
Who ride because we can’t be trammed,
The anti-Socialistic ’bus
Goes bumbling onward, like a d —d,
Grim, grievous, time-destroying hearse,
Inviting moral men to curse.
When will that better period start
When we’ll go down a dustless street,
And dodge the petrol dead-cat-cart
With concrete blocks beneath our feet,
Or take the Socialistic car,
That runs where brains and progress are?
Not yet, nor soon, it seems! For still
Behind the sacred council-doors
There is more noise of snack and swill
Than of hard work —stout councillors
Pushing their jobs aside to munch
A ratepayer-provided lunch.

FORM AND FASHION.
HOW TO SUBDUE STOUTNESS.
A pretty, slender figure, with a graceful
poise of body, is the modern cult of Fash-
ion’s votaries. This is the age of slimness.
Stout ladies are at a disadvantage. How-
ever, there is an easy and most efficacious
means of recovering a slender shape. One
has but to take Marmola Prescription Tab-
lets —one after each meal and one at night
—for a time, and the overweight in super-
fluous and disfiguring fat will soon be got
rid of. This handy remedy, which is evolved
from the well-known Marmola Prescription,
calls for no unwelcome restrictions as to
diet, etc. It is the ideal of a simple and
pleasant home treatment. Marmola Pres-
cription Tablets not only subdue stoutness
and restore beauty of face and form, but im-
prove the general health, stimulate appe-
tite, promote easy digestion, and so, with the
help of well-assimilated nourishment, rein-
vigorate the muscular and nervous systems.
The subsidence of the puffiness of face,
throat, etc., due to excess of subcutaneous
fat, causes no wrinkling. Marmola Pres-
cription Tablets are sold by chemists, price
3s. 6d., or, post free, of the Marmola Com-
pany, 5 and 7 Barrack Street, Sydney,
N.S.W.*
NOTE. —For those who prefer the liquid
preparation, chemists are still dispensing the
famous prescription as follows: —One ounce
of fluid Extract of Glycyrrhiza 8.P., one
ounce of pure Glycerine P. 8., one half-ounce
of Marmola, and mix with peppermint water
to make six ounces in all. The dose is two
tcaspoonfuls after each meal.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Lady Medallist, racing home at Caulfield
with the field in hopeless pursuit, must have re-
minded many people of Carbine winning the Mel-
bourne Cup. The jockey’s colors —magpie jacket and
red cap—were the same, and the roar of the multi-
tude, although not half as mighty, had the same old
ring of laughter in it. Medallist, taking the lead
with an irresistible rush, romped away in a style that
admitted of no doubt. Backers of the nearest of the
other horses ceased to shout their names. There was
only one in it. The result was a crusher for those
who had expected to get a Cup tip from the form in
a trustworthy test. The only impression to be ob-
tained from this hare-and-hounds race was that no-
thing, save the winner, could be an animal of great
importance. And the M.L. mare was not entered for
the Cup. Apart from two lightweights—Twa Brigs and
Indiscreet, of whom the latter stayed the longer—
the ones that made most show until the favorite put
them all to shame, were Beverage, Didus, Flavian,
Aurofodina, Sandbath and Jolly Beggar. The others
might as well have been in their stables. Britain,
who finished fifth, was perhaps the only member of
the ruck that improved its position in the last half-
mile. But when the winner has several lengths to
spare, and there are a few more lengths between the
second and third, the other placings are not worth
considering. # #
There wasn’t much the matter with
McLachlan’s riding of Popinjay at Caulfield last
Saturday, when the squibby three-year-old raced
neck and neck with Blast for six furlongs. Pike had
the mpunt on Kelso’s “good thing,” and there was
never more than the length of an umbrella between
the two horses. Popinjay won by half a head.
"0.K.” : Sandbath is one of the hardest of
Melbourne Cup horses to size up. His way of win-
ning the Waverley Handicap (li mile), at Rand-
wick, suggested that he was a stayer; also, the
English record of the imported horse favors the
idea. But, in the Coongy Handicap, at Caulfield
last week, meeting Didus on 131 b. worse terms than
in the Waverlev aforesaid, Sandbath appeared to be
fairly oustayed' by Merton’s equally uncertain ani-
mal.' Sandbath, after hanging fire at the outset,
got the lead and looked like winning, but was
finally beaten out of a place, as though he were
short of condition. Yet he had previously run away
with a longer race. He has the character of a
rogiie, and wears blinkers; he is a fine, big chap,
that ought to be up to a heavy weight; neverthe-
less, his only victory in this country was seemingly
accounted for by his light burden; and though
he looks short of condition, the work he has done
since the last day of the Randwick meeting has not
improved him. So, between one thing and another,
Sandbath, at time of writing—previous to the Caul-
field Cup—strikes one as being a very dangerous
horse to touch —or to leave alone. *
Comedy King’s nasty behavior in the
Caulfield Stakes struggle, the other Saturday, sug-
gested that his series of defeats had soured his
temper. When Malt King overhauled him near the
winning post, the black horse made a highly intelli-
gent attempt to bite his rival’s neck.
* * * *
Two or three of the horses that were
scratched for the Caulfield Cup had better paper
chances of winning than a dozen that ran, but
their owners reckoned them too good to be put on
the apparently hopeless job of beating Aurofodina and
Lady Medallist. Eye Glass, for instance, would
have been left in the race if the two awe-inspiring
w.f.a. performers had not been there. The fact
that the little son of Isinglass didn't start, although
his owner had backed him, goes to favor the idea
that he will get away with one of the minor handi-
caps this spring. # *
What are the odds against Malt King
proving himself a two-miler before the end of the
season? Nowadays, the handsome chestnut looks
a stayer all over, and behind the fact that he won
the H mile Metropolitan so brilliantly, there is the
fact that he was heavily backed to do it (with 9st.
lib), notwithstanding his reputation for being best
at a mile. One would pick Malt King on present
appearances to be best at two miles.
Naturally the 4-year-old Woad, with only
fist. 71b. to carry, is regarded as the pick of the
Melbourne Cup handicap. A son of True Blue, he
should be able to go the distance, and his recent
form in the Metropolitan, the Sydney Handicap, and
the Final Handicap at Randwick would make him
out to be well in for the Melbourne Cup, at 121 b.
more than he is asked to carry. Presumably Woad
will be given another chance to earn a penalty before
the day, seeing that he may have to hump a few
pounds' more- than fist. 71b. in any case. Owners are
badly in need of competent jockeys at the minimum
weight. When Colma beat Woad by a short neck m
the Sydney Handicap, the winner carried 6st. 131 b.
instead of 6st. 81b., the owner putting up with the
extra weight, rather than forego the services of
boy Shanahan.
Talking of the breakdown of the English
Derby winner before the Leger came due, a sporting
writer moralised thus: “Supposing old customs had
survived, what tons of money would now be lost on
the colt! Years ago there was betting on the Leger
long before the Derby. My theory with regard to
ante-post betting is that bookmakers killed it by
their preposterous rapacity in the first place, and by
their trickiness in the second —because of the ab-
surdly pinched prices they offered against genuine
horses, and because of the manner in which, time
after time, some animal was ingeniously rushed to a
short price when subsequent events showed that it
had never been intended to run. . . . It is no
wonder that backers grow tired of being thus
caught ” Well, in the Commonwealth, where book-
makers are just as tricky and even more rapacious
the totalisator in four of the States has spared
backers the trouble of growing tired of ante-post
betting; and it only remains for N.S.W. and Vic. to
legalise the quiet, fair-dealing machine, and rid the
rest of the country of its cormorants.
The Totalisator “performed some, as the
Yankees say, at the Tasmanian Racing Club’s meet-
ing at Hobart. Crocus, romping home in the Els-
wick Purse, paid out £l5 for each quid invested,
and Minster’s rush to second place in the same event
was the cause of his backers receiving the noble divi-
dend of £25. Has anyone heard of a bookmaker
paying £25 on the second horse? On the other
hand—when the entry-book for the Caulfield Cup
closed some months ago, it contained the names of
173 prads, all sure triers, according to Isaac Bhagg,
who promptly laid the odds in the recesses of the
clubs of Melbourne and on the suburban racecourses
of Sydney. But on Saturday only 16 faced the
starter, for 157 nags, most of them carrying some
public money, had dropped out, and, incidentally,
dropped their loads into the bag of Isaac. What
fools these punters be.
The Mclntosh was hard at work in Suite
2, Stadium, Sydney, dealing it out to the Rev. F. C.
Spurr and the Wowsers who had been denouncing
him as a promoter of Brutal Sports, when somebody
remarked that the two men who had perished in the
Thirroul surfing disaster had left behind seven help-
less little kiddies. The Mclntosh pricked up his ears,
dropped his pen, left the Wowsers unanswered, and
got busy communicating with the surfing clubs on
how to do something for the little orphans. He pro-
posed to give a benefit of some sort at the Stadium
for the purpose of raising funds. This was nearly a
fortnight after the disaster, and, so far, there had
been no wild rush on the part of the Wowsers, led
by the Rev. Spurr, to do anything for the little ones.
But when Mclntosh started, a breath of mighty
energy blew over the landscape, and sundry persons
took off their coats and began to do things. A pub-
lic meeting was convened, and a committee formed
to help in the good work, and in the end every boxer
and vaudeville artist in Sydney came on the scene.
Mr. Maas offered the Tivoli and company, Mr. Skinner
the Palace, and the Sydney Orchestral Society ten-
dered music. The show comes off at the Stadium to-
night (Thursday). Mclntosh is also hard at work
devising means of raising a fund for the benefit of
the widows and orphans of the lost Rosedale, Mac-
leay and Yongala. And beyond that looms up the
shadow of another monster benefit for the purpose of
raising the wind on behalf of Sydney Hospital. For
all of these good objects the boxers will give their
services free, and the Mclnstoush and staff will
spend their energy without fee or reward. Vaude-
ville stars and oruising comets may not be the salt
of the earth from a churchy point of view, but they
have a lot of the milk of human kindness about
them, and seem to be of more real value to the un-
fortunate part of the community than all the Wowser
organisations put together.
Although Hughie Mehegan vanquished
Hock Keys, and retained the lightweight champion-
ship of Australia at the Mclntosh’s Stadium, Sydney,
on Saturday night, the honor and the hallelujah were
not his. For the loser showed the winner more of
the art of scientific assault than he could learn if he
hired a string of typists to get it down on paper
for him. Mehegan won with six rounds to spare, but
for practically the whole of the 12 rounds the exhi-
bition lasted he was treated as a skilled animal-
trainer treats a fractious pupil—no undue severity,
but sufficient firm correction every time he shows
fight and stubbornness to make it clear who is the
master. And the joy of the crowd knew no limits
when it saw its old idol making a hack of its new
champion. In the fifth round Keys boxed as bril-
liantly as ever he did at the height of his fame. His
opponent looked on, and thanked the guardian angel
of the ring that there was so little weight in the
blows that came with the rapidity of a threshing
machine running amok. He kept a wonderful control
of himself throughout, all things considered, clearly
much impressed with the unlooked for revival before
him, doing what was possible in retaliation, and
patiently waiting for the moment, expected much
earlier on all sides of the ring, when Keys’s steam
would blow out. Up to the tenth round the holder
of the championshin took the load that came his way
without a sign that he was losing confidence, al-
though only a knock-out could win him the fight.
But when, two rounds later, the enemy was still
firing up, he (Mehegan) became suddenly anxious,
and started in to plough his man out. But the end
was not yet. The thirteenth round saw Keys weak-
ening fast, but as skilful as ever, while Mehegan
stood at times like a sheep, bewildered. Then all
in a flash came the end. The gong clanged round
15, and Mehegan early landed a clout that sent the
Veteran staggering to the ropes—crunched up. The
towel mercifully saved the knock-out, after the second
knock down. Youth had triumphed over skill run to
seed.
There is one thing that Mehegan ought to thank
Hock Keys for, and that is for demonstrating to him
how simple it is for a man with a punch to fell
him like a pole-axed bullock when he is overdoing
that smother of his, as he so often does. On Satur-
day, Mehegan, bent low, with both arms wrapped
round his head, tried to force his way past Keys’s
battery, but the latter, stepping cleverly backward
as the other advanced, again and again chopped down
on the unprotected neck. Apparently it didn’t hurt
Mehegan; but another time, if the man who chops
has a blow like a falling beam, he won’t be able to
say he wasn’t warned.
Frank Thorn and Charlie Griffin catered
for a large sporting audience in Melbourne Guild
Hall on Friday night. Griffin had not been seen in
Melbourne since his American adventures, and his
previous meeting with Thorn resulted in such an
amount of assault and battery that there was an im-
mediate public outburst of Wowserism. Thorn has
not improved any in the meantime, and the fact that
he was in a position to give Charlie a perfectly work-
manlike extinguishment proves that Yankee methods
have done Griffin no good. Griffin was a direct, de-
termined, smifiner fighter before he left Australia ;
now he is a hugger-mugger scrapster, a worker of
points. He succeeded in evading grievous mischief
till round 12, and made a dull mill of it. In the
12 th he got up against a punch that gave him a
large astonished-looking nose. He never got over
that punch, and although the referee ordered an ad-
ditional round after 20 had gone, there was no call
for it. Thorn had been daddy in the last 10, and in
the first 10 there was nothing to anybody’s credit.
Thorn won on points.
“Pills”: Touching fights between white
and black. The writer is not a Wowser, but
a humble medical person who objects to any
fighting contest between the two 'colors (ex-
cept in legitimate warfare), on the following
grounds, to wit: He (the humble medical
person aforesaid) sees no harm in a friendly con-
test between two Irish terriers, or between a pair
of healthv gamecocks. Nor docs be eb; nc .
tion to three rounds between two gorillas in their
native wilds at M’Boona M’Boona, or words to that
effect. Like dislikes like, and all is well. But lie
objects to a public exhibition of stoush between a
pigeon and an animal with a hidden-fire repeating
12-bore “Greener,” charged with No. 4 shot and
E.C. powder. Also, between a Methodist parson
and a Sydney Apache. Likewise, between a cham-
pion Marquis of Queensberry boxer and a Turkish
wrestling terror. And—-worst of all —between a
Black and a White. They are not, and can’t be,
well matched. Physique, training, weight and
pluck may be equally measured, but temperament
never can be. They are two different animals. It
may be fair, but it is never anything but brutal.
It is never “sport” in the true sense of the word.
Therefore, this writer objects. Let there be a white
champion and a black champion, if you like. And,
by the way, why should we keep out a black wharf-
laborer and let in a black “pug.”
* * * *
Although Jack Johnson is still loudly pro-
claiming his retirement from the ring at some un-
specified date, fight followers generally are not im-
pressed. It is felt that it is merely another advertis-
ing dodge on the part of the golden-mouthed nigger.
The gentleman used to keep himself before the public
by motor speeding ; but he has found it an expensive
form of advertising, and ever since they jugged him
for the third or thirtieth offence, Johnson has gone
what for him is dead slow. He says frankly that he
hates jug, and all the boosting in the world doesn’t
compensate for a fortnight in quod. His latest
advt., by the way, was gained in London, where his
landlady recovered damages for smashage of crockery
and furniture. Johnson’s plea was that the goods
smashed themselves —in other words, that they per-
ished through “wear and tear.”
* * * *
Little Willie Papke has come to the con-
clusion that the world is a cold place. Australia
didn’t enthuse over him ; England has jeered at him,
and called him a spoilt baby; and now, on his re-
turn to his native land, the United States has risen
solidly and cursed him. William has the knack of
getting himself disliked by the public and detested
by other boxers. He has passed deprecatory remarks
about most of the men he has fought, and quite a
number of them are looking around for hide, or
something of that sort, by way of compensation.
Papke hasn’t learned the first lesson of successful ad-
vertising. Every boxer who hopes to rise in the
world should crack up the men he wallops or who
wallop him, to the very zenith of his ability; and by
praising them create in the public mind an im-
pression that he must be an almighty fine fighter
to do so well as he has done against such human
tigers. Papke is not wise, as they say in the States.
It did not take the stewards of the Warr-
nambool road race long to strip Collins of his hard-
won glory. He won the race on Saturday, and on
Wednesday the stewards disqualified him, awarding
the first place to Tebs and the second place to Less-
ing, the man who lodged the protest. Collins
promptly gave notice of appeal to Caesar, or, in
other words, to the Appeal Board of the Victorian
League of Wheelmen. But from all accounts that is
not likely to do him much good, unless he can bring
some rebutting evidence that was not available at
the first inquiry. This Warrnambool, by the way, was
the last to finish in Melbourne, the Dunlop Co.
having realised that unless it can hire a double line
of stalwart, infantry, armed with fixed bayonets, to
place right along the last mile, the people cannot
be kept from rushing the course, and interfering
with the riders in a close finish. So, henceforth,
the Warrnambool will finish further out.

The Victorian Swimming Association is
desperately anxious to enter Beaurepaire as its repre-
sentative in the amateur championships meeting at
Adelaide in January. At present he is engaged by
the Victorian Government as natatorial instructor,
and there is a feeling that there is a big difference
between a man employed by the State to teach swim-
ming and one who makes his living, or part of it, by
swimming for money prizes. S.A. is quite agreeable to
an amendment of the rules which will allow “Bogey”
to compete, and so is Westralia. But N.S.W. is dead
against the proposal, and, as far as can be seen, one
objection is fatal.
Although Saturday’s breeze was about as
strenuous as a pet dairy cow, the day was a disas-
trous one for the Prince Alfred Yacht Club. Perhaps
the addition of Royal to the name brought bad luck.
Anyhow, the whole fleet went to the dogs utterly on
Saturday. It was the ocean race for the Jackson
trophy, the course being from Fort Denison (Port
Jackson) to a mark moored five miles to windward
of South Reef, and back again to Farm Cove. Seven
yachts started. One retired at the Heads, partially
disabled. Rawhiti sprung its mast going through
the Heads. Ranee carried away the port shroud
just outside, and headed for home. Petrel’s jib
halliards gave way. Yeulba’s main-brace, or some-
thing like that, blew up. All these retired. This
left only Culwulla 111. and Thelma in the race.
Thelma’s cross-tree began to dismember, and Cul-
wulla’s halliards fouled, so that the top-sail could not
be hoisted, but they held on, and saw it out.
Thelma is a yacht which likes a strong breeze, and
in the soft one the lighter Culwulla walked away
and won by nearly five minutes.
Consider the progress of Horace Rice, at
Strathfield tournament, and the glory thereof. In-
clusion in the Davis Cup contest should certainly be
his now. On the previous Saturday he had won, with
F. L. Jones, the doubles championship; but last
Saturday he went baresark, annexing the singles
final from the redoubtable Dr. Sharp, and, with Mrs.
Ford, winning the mixed doubles championship. The
doctor never had a hope in the singles, Rice downing
him with 6-3 and 8-6 in a tussle that was an exqui-
site exhibition of high-class tennis. A. B. Jones and
Miss D. Gordon put up a very stern struggle in the
mixed doubles, and, but for the fact that Miss Gor-
don’s luck had taken a day off, they might have
won. The figures were: 6-4, .3-6, 8-6, and right
through the game was full of glorious uncertainty.
The third round of Sydney first-grade
cricket commenced on Saturday in dull, sultry
weather. The result was a drab-tinted display, as far
as the bat was concerned ; although the leather scin-
tillated somewhat, and, anyhow, got all over the
willow. Paddington, led by M.A.N., piled up 264
yipnilo Wnrhor. T T njvP<-cjtv banged Waverlev
for 212. Burwood notched 182 against North Syd-
ney. Glebe garnered io3‘ against Central Cumber-
land. Gordon totted up 135 against Petersham.
Balmain put up quite a dazzling performance by
scoring 117 against, Sydney, and then dismissing the
metropolitan club for 56. Sydney’s name would ap-
pear to be Mud. Not a single century graced the
afternoon, the ton score being Noble’s 83 against
Middle Harbor. His club-mate, L. A. Cody, made
the second highest score of 68 ; and N. Farry, also of
Paddington, was fifth on the list with 55. Barbour,
of University, left 56 to his credit, and R. B. Min-
nett backed him un with 55 for the same club. But
the hero of the afternoon was Folkard, of Balmain,
he who ruined Sydney’s chances by felling seven
wickets for 34. Sydney had a mighty trundler also,
but apparently didn’t put him on soon enough, for
Finneran took seven Balmain wickets for 53. Haz-
litt of Central Cumberland, wiped out six Glebe
batsmen for 55; and J. Randall, of Middle Harbor,
snatched eight Paddington wickets for 84 runs,
which was good going.
The cricket team from India —the boomed
“team of 11 Ranjis”—made a horrible exhibition of
itself during the recent English season. It struck
the hottest summer on record, which should have
given it a big pull, yet it complained of being put
off by the heat. The best batsman (whose name
sounds like influenza) had an average of 31, and he
only played four innings. The best bowling average
was over 20. The programme arranged was with
some of the counties, including a good many that
are not first-class, and several social clubs in Scot-
land and Ireland. Yet the Indians won only six
games and drew two, while they lost 15. However,
they smiled the patient smile of India, and said they
had Merely Come to Learn.
N.S.W. Rifle Association’s 62nd annual
shoot at Hand wick (Sydney) attracted a record rush
for the spoil and glory. The reduction in the size
of the bull’s-eye chopped out the run of “possibles”
which had grown monotonous. The prize of the
meeting was, of course, “The King’s,” which carried
£lOOO for division. The excitement over the finish
of the Warrnambool wasn’t in it with the fearsome
duel between H. Motton and W. II- Cutler. MottOD
had put up the appalling score of 293, and Cutler
settled down calmly to overtake him. And he all
but did it, running up to 292 ; which was a wonder-
ful feat, and proves that we still have men with
nerves that would turn an axe. But the amazing
part of it was that a second man, A. W. Parsons,
also got to 292. He had to take third place, as Cut-
ler had scored his points at a longer range. Fourth
man was G. French with 191, and behind these
there straggled in over 700 others. Motton scored 49
out of 50 at 800yds., and 45 out of 50 at both
900yds. and 1000yds. Motton and Cutler are old
friends and rivals, Cutler having held the “King’s”
in 1904 and Motton in 1905. A new item on the
programme was the compulsory “range-finding” com-
petition. All pluggers were yarded up each day in
an attempt to locate “fatigue men” who bobbed up
at any distance inside 1750yds. The accuracy of
some of the gauging is said to have been absolutely
uncanny.
The successful potting of the “running man” and
“disappearing targets” suggests that the really busi-
ness side of rifle shooting is progressing very favor-
ably indeed. In the “Philip Charley” E. J. Kelly’s
score of eight bulls in 10 shots was worth more than
the £5 ss. prize. H. Holliday gathered in the
“Holmes Aggregate” for the best tally at the many
and varied and elusive targets, in a manner that sug-
gests anything but a picnic for those who may
hereafter meet him in battle array. Of the teams.
Parramatta C easily eclipsed all comers. “The Raw-
son” (teams rapid snap shooting), the “Cooke Chal-
lenge Trophy” (for best aggregate scores at the
erratic targets), and the title of “Champion Service
Team” all went to it, and Parramatta is wearing a
crinoline on its head, because no hat is large
enough. Randwick A took “The Anderson” disap-
pearing target match at unknown distances, and
Penrith appropriated “The Hoad” for unknown-dis-
tance shooting at the running travesty of the image
of God. As said before, the shooters are now be-
coming craftsmen in’ the art of killing suddenly
with monotonous regularity, which is a useful ac-
complishment for a small nation to acquire. ,
It was something of a coincidence that 26
starters should career over the 26 miles marked out
for the Victorian Marathon. Sydney was represented
by C. A. Bullivant, of South Sydney Harriers. A
mob of sheep, numbering 2000, impeded the runners
in the neighborhood of Essendon, and are understood
to have chased them out of the course, or something
like that. As for the race itself, it was a one man
show from start to finish, and the man was J. Lewis,
of East Melbourne. At 10 miles he cut down his
field, and then galloped away from it, landing home
with a good mile to spare between him and the
second man, A. C. Ryan. W. Murray was tliird.
The dust was fearful, and Lewis arrived home black
with it, having careered over the distance in 2hr.
59tmin. It’s a good game to follow—in a motor-car.
The winner, Jack Lewis, is a well-constructed
Dago youth, and is really a Sydney product as' far
as his running is concerned. He finished third in the
first Australian Marathon race, held at Sydney on
Easter Monday, 1909. Though he has competed in
several other Marathons, this is his first success.
The legal advisers of George Guelph
came another cropper last week, in Sydney. Two
bookmakers, following some sailing races on the
Harbor, and being unable to pay their bets, were
saved by a police officer from what threatened to be
a most embarrassing argument. But the John Hop
merely removed one unpleasantness to create another,
which took the form of a summons for betting.
The action was taken, however, under a section of the
Act which deals with betting in a public street, and
when the Crown opined that Port Jackson was a
public street, the magistrate told it to go and get
work at a glue factory, or somewhere else, where
the strain on its intellect wouldn’t be too great.
Bar Von, from Jericho and other Scotch settlements,
is now thinking of mooring a lugger off Pinehgut and
bawling the odds on the Melbourne Cup to the pass-
ing ferry boats.
J. Gorman, on Monday last, attempted to fracture
a motor-cycle record, a fence, and, incidentally, his
neck, being successful in the first, but a bad second
in the others. However, he is of a. philosophical
turn of mind, and believes in achieving one thing at
a time. Starting from Ballarat Post Office at 6
a.m., he covered the first 40 miles of the road to
Melbourne in 55 minutes. A sharp turn at the
bottom of a din saw him at loggerheads with a
fence, which withstood the attack, but did not _ im-
prove the appearance of the machine or the rider,
spraining the latter’s right hand. Twenty minutes
later, the mount was again in running order, and
Melbourne G.P.O. was reached at 7.56 a.m., thus re-
ducing the former record by a trifle of 19 minutes,
which is a fair thing in a distance of 71 miles.
Gorman has come rapidly to the front of late, and is
now one of the top-notehers at the game. He used
steel-studded tyres (Continental), and found them
hold the greasiest patches with ease.*
From the Oldest Inhabitant: —
Mrs. Walter Hall, widow of the just-dead Mount
Morganaire, is a daughter of the late George Kirk,
of Melbourne. Kirk reached Port Phillip in 1839.
started as a farm hand, fencer, shingler, etc., and
worked up to jumbuclts, wool and wealth. He was
not, as some napers have said, the George Kirk who
founded Kirk’s Bazaar, though he leased that historic
institution once. For many years he was a sleeping
partner in the old stock and station firm of Edward
Row and Co. ; and thereby hangs a characteristic
tale. E. Row and Co. banked at the “New South,”
and had a big overdraft, something like £30,000.
Row had reached the limit; a cheque for £lOOO was
presented (or came through for clearance), and the
ledger-keeper, now an old man in Sydney, took the
document to the manager, who told him to “hold
over,” and he would communicate with Row. Somehow
Kirk heard of it, got hold of Row’s pass-book, and
desired that it should be made up at 2 o’clock. It
was done, and George Kirk gave his own cheque on
the Union Bank for the overdraft, and closed the
account. The manager explained and explained, but
the “New South” lost a very profitable account. In
his old age Kirk became a member of Parliament in
the jumbuck interest- and died wealthy.
THEY STIR THE LIVER.
NO REMEDY AS POTENT AS DR.
MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT PILLS.
The climate of Australia is such that the
Liver gets out of order quicker than any
other organ of the body. When the Liver
does get out of order the whole system is
upset, and Constipation, Biliousness and
Stomach Troubles follow speedily. Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills reach the Liver
as no other remedv ever did. They open
the clogged ducts, allowing the Bile to flow,
which is essential to the digestion and as-
similation of food. Constipation, Bilious-
ness, Stomach Troubles and Sick Head-
aches are the result of Liver inactivity, and
the remedy that “Stirs the Liver” will at
once relieve these distressing complaints.

Miller, M.L.A., of N. S. Wales, is evi-
dently getting ready to leave the “grand
old Liberal party.” He told the Bathurst
people, the other day, that “no matter what
a member’s views were, if the party whip
was cracked, he was supposed to vdte against
those views.” Which, coming from a “Lib-
eral,” must be very annoying to the Anti-
bosh press, whose trump card is the free-
dom of “Liberalism” and the tyranny of the
Labor caucus. But if he breaks away, it
will be interesting to see whether Miller
joins Storey and other grotesque “indepen-
dents. This spectacle of so-called indepen-
dents meeting as a party, and owning a
leader, is one of the minor comedies of the
Ma State’s Parliament. It suggests that
Uflion ot Free Laborers that once existed in
Melbourne.
, ?c r ‘ Maloney, M.H.R., “speaking on be-
half ot himself and other Socialists,” wants
to have an area for “a purely co-operative
settlement ’ set apart In the Federal capital
territory. Considering the number of things
that various people are trying to shove into
that stunted little bit of territory, it looks
as if suffocation is imminent.
“The Old Soldier”: Touching the question
of “The Aeroplane in War” —a subject on
Which Certain Organs have been going Clean
daft Of lhte—t stfuck some detailed reports
Of last year’s Fibrich and Hetman manoeu-
vres the other day. A sample extract
With regard to accuracy, it is well to bear in
even at the low and risky elevation of
loOOtt., which was about that maintained by the
rrench aviators, a column of infantry on the march
looks like a dark line moving slowly across the
country, the number of separate units or detach-
ments being shown by breaks in the line; the strength
ot the column is shown by its length.
In any case, for observations to be of any use, the
observer must be experienced and highly trained in
reconnoitring from above.
Troops finding themselves under observation by
aeiual scouts will adopt various means to deceive the
latter by laying out dummy works and guns, occu-
pying houses, or building overhead cover of branches,
straw, grass, or any other material for their real
trenches.
During the German manoeuvres, the Bed side once
succeeded in deceiving the air-scouts on board the
Lnnn e M \ whic h was sailing at a height of
3000 ft. or 4000 ft., as to the whereabouts of their
positiotii The Weather was rather cloudy; a
Was P.fspared With artistiCally-coil-
e<* field-Works. It caught the eyes of the on-
oervers, Who in good faith reported it as the enemy’s
a u^ 1011 ’ ■ whe feupon the Blue force halted all
night before it, with a view to attacking it in the
morning. Meantime, the real position of the Reds was
intrenched miles away.
Plainly aerial scouting is not infallible, even
under the most favorable conditions. And
there is the further consideration that condi-
tions are rarely favorable, anyhow. In
Furope it is only possible to fly on from 80
to IUO days a year. Here the position, from
the airmans point of view, is even worse,
humor -easter, which blows from nine a.m.,
or thereabouts, till dusk every day hzough-
out the summer, is viewed with hois&r by
aviators. The news that a southerly s ap-
proaching keeps them chained to earth like
tombstones. And, finally, the Australian at-
mosphere is alleged by those who should
know, to be riddled with lethal air-pockets,
lakmg one thing with another, the writer
opines that the aeroplane is a good thing to
try and improve, but a perfectly rotten one
to so much as dream of relying on for sal-
vation. Napoleon’s axiom concerning the
value of the big battalions still applies, with
the. difference that they need rather more
training to-day than they did a century ago.
Some of the crowd that returns Wade to
Parliament are starting to battle for a State
line of ferries to carry the train passengers
across from Milson’s Point to Circular Quay,
Sydney. Putting the movement into words,
the Rev. Paul Clipsham gravely told the
Sun’s young man:—
While we don’t believe in interfering with Private
Enterprise,- some of us feel that, unless something is
donC 16' iklltifk the present crush of traffic intended
for the train's, the' Minister should run a line of
boats specially f6f the trains.-
It is a horribly illogical Sentence; but, then,
Anti-Sosh is perpetually illogical.-
Poor, hopeless old ex-Treasufet 'lSvadde'fl
has done the “Liberal” party the bad turn
of taking a hand in the N.S.W. by-electidhfSw
Twaddell, who is usually a few years late,
thinks that the Sosh tiger is still a payable
proposition, and has been telling Gunnedah
that, when people work for the State, “the
element of individual interest is eliminated,
and the biggest incentive to industry re-
moved.” Twaddell evidently has an idea
that in a State service everybody gets the
same pay, and he thinks that Harper and
Richardson, the home-grown Railwaj Com-
missioners, are still drawing their old, orig-
inal Gs. or 7s. per day.

ARE YOU
DEAF?
If you are deaf, or going deaf, you will
be glad to hear of a simple and scientific de-
vice which will restore your hearing, no mat-
ter how old - you are. There is no mystery
or secrecy about it; we describe it fully afld
e.tplaih just how it acts.
You use spectacles as sight magnifiers, Slid
in the same way you may use this sound
inagnifier aS an aid to weak hearing. But,
unlike Spectacles, the Wilson Cdmmon-senSe
Ear-Drums are invisible and comfortable,
lou can’t tell you are wearing them. No
bne else can, either, because they are not
Step.
They rest the ear nerves by taking the
strain off them —the strain of trying to hear
dim sounds. What a blessed relief to have
done with that tiring strain!
Being made of the purest and softest Para
rubber, they cannot be felt, even when the
rests on a pillow. For the same reason,
a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
the ear. In fact, they protect the ear, the
tender inner parts that are so sensitive, from
wl dust, sudden and piercing sounds.
So that you may clearly understand why
these facts are true, and why the Sound Mag-
nifier restores the hearing, we give an illus-
tration of one as it lies in the ear. You will
notice that the Sound Magnifier is shaped
like a trumpet, and so conveys even the
faintest sounds right to the natural ear-
drum. Being of the softest rubber, it cannot
hurt the ear. It fits the orifice of the ear
with precision and comfort. The division
that runs across the mouth is to allow tile re-
moval and insertion of the Ear-Drum, and to
brace it.
The shape of the Wilson Ear-Drum has
been chosen after years of experience as the
best adapted to carry the faintest sound right
down to the natural ear-drum.
To persons who are nearly deaf, it is not
only trying to have people shout at them,
nut it hurts the ear-drum. When age comes
the ear-drum sometimes gets thickened, or
loses its tightness, aild shouting does Udt act
properly on it. It only makes a confused
and tiring noise. But the Sound Magnifiers
concentrate the sound in the best Spot for
perfect hearing.
Of course, if you have lost the hearing-
nerve completely, or were born deaf, we can-
not pretend to cure you, Onlv a miracle
could do that, in spite of some of the absurd
claims made to-day. But if you Can hear the
faintest sound, do not despair. You will
never regret trying the Wilson Ear-Drums.
” e have letters to show you from deaf people
in Australia and New Zealand who have been
cured, and you can be cured, too. You may
wear the Ear-Drums day ahd night, and take
them out whenever you wish. Children Can
wear them (we have special sizes for children
from six to twelve). Even a child cafl insert
and remove them without the least danger.
■ ,P l '}be is £1 (the fee for a doctor’s
single visit). This includes a pair of Drums
(they are only sold in pairs), a fine nickel
remover and also an inserter. After the first
pair is bought you may purchase a single
drum at any time for Bs., but the pair you
get at first will last quite two years. Do not
ask for a trial pair. We do not send them
out on trial, and so they are never second-
“ a W*l V? the Order Form below, and the
Outfit will be sent to you at once, with the
fullest instructions. Don’t delay, but have
the comfort of good hearing as soon as you
can.

Young trees to plant or any
earth boring to do, you will
find the
"IWAN" POST
HOLE DIGGER
the greatest of all earth-bor-
ing tools.
It cuts the hole just the size for the
post, in a fraction of the time taken with
bar and spade, and no time is lost ram-
ming. Works in all conditions and kinds
of soil —not rock.
On a fencing job 120 ten-inch holes can be
easily bored in a day, or 200 smaller sizes.
By extending the pipe bar the IWAN POST
HOLE DIGGER bores down to 35 feet.
Empties with a shake; is built rigid—stays
rigid—has no adjustable parts to wobble
about or stick. , ■ •

ANTINEURASTHIN
I s
the only possible means of remedying nervous
breakdown and nerve weakness.
Drugs in the form of medicines and tonics usually
containing strychnine and iron, though sometimes
giving temporary relief, must leave the patient in a
worse condition than before.
Antineurasthin contains neither drug nor chemical,
but cures by feeding the nerve and brain cells with
(heir natural food element, Lecithin, in an active
organic and highly assimilable form. It is the only
means known to science of doing this.
Sufferers are cautioned against vendors who at-
tempt to substitute crude inorganic Lecithin, in the
form of pills or medicine, as a substitute for Anti-
neurasthin. These cannot be assimilated, and have
no value as a nerve food.
Antineurasthin is prepared in tablet form, pleasant
to the taste, and convenient to carry, if travelling.

A Christmas Suggestion.
It is as difficult to choose the perfect
Christmas present as the perfect wedding
present. Now is the time when you are
worrying over the Christmas reminder
you will send to your friends overseas.
The perfect Christmas present for the
other side of the world must be easily
packed ; it must not be fragile; it must
not be the sort of gift that could be
bought in your friend’s town; it must be
uniquely Australian —in short, it must
be the half-yearly bound volume of The
Lone Hand.
This gift, the May-October volume, is
bound handsomely in cloth with gold em-
bossings. It is the essence of Australia
—as characteristically Australian as the
scent of gum leaves. Not only is it a
beautiful present, but it is a great
national advertisement for your own
country. It tells your friends overseas
more about Australia than all the letters
you could write.
As the volumes are now being bound,
it is advisable for you to send in your
order at once —Price, 6/6. Postage :
Australasia, 1/2; otherwise, 2/4.
The only guarantee readers have of
getting The Lone Hand regularly
month by month, without missing a num-
ber. is to subscribe. The subscription
rates are: —
Australasia: 6/- per annum',, post free;
or 3/- for six months, post free.
Abroad: 9/- per annum, post free.

tralian. That’s The Lone Hand. “A

ANSWERS to CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character) wil< be
taken of communications insufficiently stai-ped.
Name and address must appear on M SS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted, whether sent by post 01 handed
in; and no MS. will be returned unless stamps
(of any State) accompany.
Hamoc: Received, one packet of thin
black worms in convulsions. After a second inspec-
tion, decide that they may be MS. Life is too short
to make it worth while tackling the problem any
further. .. .E. Smith: They are not prohibited; but
don’t know where they are procurable... .Arcarlo:
Recruiting in the Solomons deserves something more
than the few lines you heaved over the fence... .
Lantana: You say that “Australia’s champion
shearer shore 2705 sheep in one year and earned over
£324.” According to unreliable information sup-
plied to The Bulletin there are several hundred
champion shearers of Australia ; also, it is common
knowledge that millions of years have elapsed at
different occasions in the world’s history. Which
year was it you referred to? If you recollect the
name of the shearer you might mention that also. . . .
A.S.R.S: Unskilful verse. It scrambles most of the
way, and makes a bad mistake in the first stanza by
trying to rhyme “cling” with “wings.”.... U.S.Ii.:
Sorry to dash your hopes, but we are convinced that
some one will yet invent a machine which will turn
out three dozen such poems for every pocket dic-
tionary that is flung into it. .. .L.S. (North Carlton,
Vic.) : Concisely put, but it isn’t saleable verse. .. .
Bellerive: Yes, but the sinners would find “A
Straight Path” helpful whether you wrote it for
your own amusement or not. Other remarks noted.
Quite agree with you that the best of poems is a
nice girl.... Hannibal (W.A.): “Contrast” fairly
violent. .. .Maoriland: Written with a greenwood
pen. Some streaks of promise, but the writing im-
plement wants seasoning. .. .J.L.1.: “Theories” has
some points, but it is no porcupine. Do you think
you could stick a few more quills in it and make it
bristle a bit f.... Billv Boyle: Readily rejected and
forgiven. . . .A.D.F.: Rather graceful, but the road to
the joke is long, and you haven’t asphalted it per-
fectly K.A.H. (V.): Three fruitless attempts.
Uneven work, and you are cardless with your rhymes.
“Dawn” and “form” supply one example. . , .M.J.K.
(V.) : Not very entertaining, and in places it has
been contorted violently in order to make the rhymes
fit. The recording angel’s speech is one example. .. .
Ben Rio: Into the abyss. .. .R.C.L.H.: Sorry had to
knock them out. . . . R.C. (V.) : Both unsuitable. . . .
Niaouli: Torn up by the office hyena. .. .John Clare:
Sweet and simole, with a good share of technical
faults J.S.T. (V.): Three misses J.G.S.
(China): No, thanks... .H.G.P.: The (oast is under-
done.... Alec C. (Q.) : Always glad to meet an
optimist, but the poem has no value. .. .X.X.X.: A
tangled temperance rhyme. Here it is with a few
alterations: —
THE CURSE OF DRINK.
While Lethe’s waters darkly flow,
The demons grin and peer,
And down the ways of darkness go
With bloated monster Beer.
While foaming beer and whisky flows,
His goal he will not win
Who down the ways of darkness goes
With pints of limpid gin.
His path is paved with dead marines,
And wanders here and there;
Upon the red-hot sun he leans
With serpents in his hair.
... .Moruya: Submit it to a local music publisher.. .
Damon: A terribly feeble poem. Found it most de-
pressing. .. .J.M. (V.): Your verses (which, by the
way, are declined) suggest that you are young and
fresh, and are just sinking your teeth into the
boardinghouse steak called Life. ... Chris R. (Syd-
ney): Can’t accept the roses. .. .L.J.V. (V.): Un-
suitable Copper Gouger: The Bulletin’s view of
the matter, already expressed, is just this. If Nor-
man White didn’t know of a rule prohibiting “tres-
pass,” then it couldn’t have been wilful and defiant
trespass, and a lot of the talk of the Mt. Lyell
directors about “maintaining discipline” is mere
hifalutin flam. Further, if White’s trespass wasn’t
wilful and in deliberate challenge of the manage-
ment’s authority (and nobody seems to have known
anything about the alleged rule), then the directors
had mighty poor justification for shutting up the
mine: they would have shown far better judgment
bad they merely laid down the rule and announced
that future fractures of it would be followed by
something painful. The fact that they prefer to go
straight ahead suggests strongly that they prefer to
take a fall out of the local unions while the copper
market is weak.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CONTRIBUTORS.
Jim Dunn: The drawing is beyond reproach, and
the gentleman who wanted the other half of the
lady, after she had been squeezed in two, reformed a
century ago... .J.C.M.: No successful black and
white artist scratches for a living. So for lesson
No. I—leave off scratching.... Kybo: It may not be
a chestnut; but this is a respectable family paper.
Try the S. M. Herald. .. .N.F.: No promise in the
drawing. Less in the poor little pun on which it
hangs. .. .C.M.: Can’t express any opinjon, not
knowing who the subjects are. They’re no use to
us, in any case.
“Button-stick”: I agree with “Field Mar-
shal” (B. 28/9/T1) that the ’plane is going
to do away with a lot of the chess-board
shuffling and masked-movement business of
armies, but I don’t think it’s going to strip
the gorgeous raiment off the cavalry and
stand the unhorsed warrior down beside his
much-looked-down-on brother the foot-wallah.
When everybody knows where everybody else
is, it is more likely that the points in the
game will go to the side that gets there first,
pockets the keys of the positions, and hands
out a jolt to that portion of the enemy that
is temporarily uncovered. The get-in-quick
move can be done better on four legs than on
two, so it is more likely that the foot-wallah
will be elevated to a prad than vice versa.
As the flying soldiers get more perfect
’planes, so that they may keep hovering
round and reoorting positions and move-
ments, armies may throw up the hide-and-
seek game in disgust, and, lining up on two
sides of a valley, have it out in old-fashioned
hammer and tongs style. If it does come
back to that, the horseman may have a
chance to come into his own again, and cut
loose amongst the infantry with swords and
lances and other cumbersome and obsolete
butcher tools. And if cavalry charges are
going to be fashionable again, there is a
chance of the tossing plumes and glittering
tin waistcoats being increased instead of re-
duced. Anyone who has seen a charge by
neat khaki-clad squadrons, and compared it
with one by a regiment with busby-bags fly-
ing, plumes streaming, colors blazing, metal
flashing, and all the other theatrical effects
full on, will admit that the latter looks more
scaresome to the Tommy waiting to be trod-
den on. Of course, this come-back to the
short-arm-punch style of fighting is all
theory, and the ’planes may result in an ex-
actly opposite direction, the armies staying
so far out of reach that they’ll never see each
other, and have to write back home to ask
how the war is getting on.
“Billy T.”: Witnessed a neat thing in Eli-
zabeth-street, Melbourne, after the theatres,
the other night. A woman whose purse had
been snatched, grappled with a likely-looking
youth, declaring shrilly that he was the thief,
A circle formed, and there were squeals and
protestations. Through the ring broke a
large man, with a stern hyena-like expres-
sion. “Here, here,” said he severely, “what’s
the disturbance?” The bereaved female re-
iterated her charge, ana the stern man’s com-
pelling hand fell on the shoulder of accused,
tearing him from the grasp of two slim citi-
zens. “Purse snatching, is it! ejaculated
mt s t l in e g;Tpping ° a “ciS^th^a?ge
apostle of law, order and good government
pushed his prisoner before him, till they came
to Little Collins-street, into which thorough-
fare the pair turned together. When a
sprinkling of followers reached the corner
the upholder of order and his prisoner were
seen scooting in the distance, and making
good time. Apparently the purse went with
them.

A German Opinion of BEALE PIANOS
“ M USICAL O PINION AND M USIC T rade Review,” London, July, 1911, says:-
“A Hamburg trade journalist, who has just returned from the Antipodes, states that the pianos
“manufactured by the Beale Company in Sydney greatly resemble in touch and in tone those turned
“out at the best German factories. The Beale is sold at forty-five pounds and upwards, and enjoys
“a good reputation not only in Australia but in India, Java, South Sea Islands and other colonial
“countries with hot climates. The ‘Hamburger’ fears that if these British colonials extend their piano
“manufacturing operations there will be little room left for continental makers in the musical
“instrument line.”

He Would Scratch Until Blood Ran.
One Box of Cuticura Ointment and
Nearly One Cake of Cuticura Soap
Cured Him Has Had No Return.
“When my boy was about three months
old, his head broke out with a rash which
was very itchy and ran a watery fluid. We
tried everything we could but he got worse
all the time, till it spread to his arms, legs
and then to his entire body. He got so bad
that he came near dying. The rash would
itch so that he would scratch till the blood
ran. and a thin yellowish stuff would be all
over his pillow in the morning. I had to put
mittens on his hands to prevent him tearing
his skin. He was so weak and run down that
he took fainting spells as if he were dying.
He was almost a skeleton and his little hands
were thin like claws.
“He was bad about eight months when we
tried Cuticura Remedies. I had not laid him
down in his cradle in the daytime for a long
while. I washed him with Cuticura Soap and
put on one application of Cuticura Ointment
and he was so soothed that he could sleep.
You don't know how glad I was he felt better.
It took one box of Cuticura Ointment and
pretty near one cake of Cuticura Soap to cure
him. I think our boy would have died but
for the Cuticura Remedies and I shall always
remain a firm friend of them. He was cured
more than twenty years ago, and there has
been no return of the trouble. I shall be
glad to have you publish this true statement
of his cure.” (Signed) Mrs. M. C. Maitland,
Jasper, Ontario, Canada, May 27. 1910.
Cuticura Soap and Ointment afford the
most economical treatment for affections of
the skin and scalp of infants, children and
adults. A cake of Cuticura Soap and a box
of Cuticura Ointment are often sufficient.

If you would like to see the alteration Grey
Hairs make, just lay a piece of paper over each of
the two halves of the above portrait. The Grey
“half” will then be seen to have the appearance
of 45 years of age, where ts the other half looks
only 30. Dr. B. Allen’s (LI.S. A.) Mexican Walnut
Stain will make all those years of difference if you
are grey or prematurely grey. It is perfectly
harmless, easy to apply, and will quickly restore
the hair to the natural shade of youth, or younger
years.
Dr. B. Allen’s <u.s.a.)
Mexican
Walnut Stain
is offered as a Superior Stain. It contains no lead,
mercury, silver, sulphur, etc., and is equally suit-
able for Ladies’ Hair, or Hair of the Beard or
Moustache. None genuine without the signature
of —Alfred Ardley (Registered in the Patents

ABOUT SHOWMEN.
“Blue Mask”: The age of coincidences is not past,
as the circumstances of the death of Harry Rickards
last week go to show. Rickards was an exceedingly
superstitious man. He would never take any im-
portant step on a Friday; the 13th of the month
was a date which he avoided as much as possible;
and black lettering on a yellow playbill or poster was
anathema to him, and dangerous to mention. Now for
the coincidences: (1) Rickards died on a Friday;
(2) it was the 13th of the month; (3) the watch
he gave his daughter Noni (Mrs. Ted Maas), although
wound and in good order, stopped dead at 1.15 a.m.
on Saturday, which was the exact time the cable
verifying the unlucky' news was received; (4) it
hasn’t moved since; and (5) the writer, in taking
a note of some incidents in Rickards’s career, found
that these coincidences were shorthanded on folio 13.
Wirths have built a new hippodrome on a stretch
of ground off the St. Kilda-road (Melbourne), origin-
ally converted from desolation by the Princes Court
Co. Their previous circus building, on the same de-
sirable property, is now the Olympia Picture Palace
(leased by Spencer), and adjoining is the spacious
roller-skating rink, also erected by Wirths and run by
them. This new hippodrome is a smart structure of
its galvanised iron sort, electric-lighted throughout,
and big enough to seat the 3500 people who will
stream in on Caulfield Cup night for the first time.
The Wirthian building enterprises are a practical
illustration of the mismanagement of the local Lands
Department. The land now known as Wirths’ Park
was a mere rubbish domain when Fitzgerald Bros,
leased a patch of it, and the Princes Court Co. fol-
lowed suit. The Court flourished awhile, and then
died for want of fresh novelties, and finally Wirths
got the tenancy of the whole acreage, and have put
building after building on it. All this time the
Lands Department has been idly contemplating the
evidences of its own red-taped stupidity. Instead of
leasing the valuable land to Wirths, or others, at a
low ground rent, it might have made thousands a
year for many years past by fixing up light and
airy show places and letting them to showmen on
its own account. It builds cold storages, etc., to
supply the wants of Private Enterprise. Why it
should have left a fine site at the south entrance to
the city to be languidly exploited by Private Enter-
prise in Public Entertainment is one of the mys-
teries of State politics.
“Presto”: Wizard Nicola, in Melbourne, is good.
Some of note: Anderson, Blitz, Bosco, Chapman, Dob-
ler, Frikell, Haselmayer, Heller, Hercat, Hermann,
Hertz, Houdini, Jacobs, Kellar, Lynn, Leroy, Malini,
Maskelyne, Ooiu, Philippe, Robin, Soo, Stodare.
The apparatus of Anderson and Heller was so exten-
sive as to take all their time to fix up. Tricks dove-
tailed into each other, and the ideal was to make
the whole show one long trick. Frikell captivated
by doing without apparatus. Stodare introduced
the Indian basket trick and other Orientalisms.
Then came the endless mirror business, suggested by
Pepper’s Ghost.
“Locust”: Saw George Rignold with young Red-
mond, M.P., the other day. Reminds me of an epi-
sode when old man John Redmond was out here 20
years or so ago. Rignold was then lessee of Her
Majesty’s Theatre. He was an ardent Home Ruler,
and, when asked for the use of the theatre, he con-
sented, only stipulating that “no sedition was to be
talked in Her Majesty’s own theatre.” There was a
big roll-up of ecclesiastics, Irishmen, politicians, etc.
Rignold sat in the stage box, and listened to the
splendid speeches from Redmond and his colleagues.
At the end someone proposed a vote of thanks to
Rignold for his kindness in lending the theatre (it
was very plucky in that period, as there was much
prejudice abroad), and there were calls for a speech.
Rignold stood up in the box and declaimed:
“It is the cause, my friends, it is the cause,”
and brought the house down. “The most concise
and eloquent address I ever listened to,” said a very
distinguished prelate, now in the cemetery ; and that
was the general opinion.
If the risks of “cut-throat competition” compel
the mightiest theatrical managements to combine,
how about the "icture showmen ? In theatrical com-
petition the law of the survival of the fittest —in
each particular line —must hold good. The incite-
ment to bold artistic enterprise is there. Com-
mercial wisdom and vigilance are their own reward.
But the picture showmen, for the most part, are all
producing the same attractions, on much the same
level of efficiency all the time. In advertising their
own programmes they make notoriety for items which
their rivals will stage, or screen, presently. A glar-
ing case in point occurred a while ago in Melbourne,
when the hoardings were plastered o’er with heroic
oblong announcements of “The Grip of Alcohol,” em-
bellished with a medallion picture of a dishevelled
whisky maniac. “The Grip” was Hoyt’s specialty
for the coming week, but it couldn’t have been of
extra special value to the business at St. George’s
Hall, seeing that the place is always crowded, or
tightly packed. A week later West’s, and then other
picture theatres, had “The Grip,” and the glory of
Hoyt’s advt. was reflected on their shows. The pic-
ture which is “featured” on one bill to-day gets an
ordinary place on other bills soon afterwards. Thus
far, the principal managements have onlv relaxed
their competition as regards the fixing of dates in a
theatrical way of speaking. They don’t clash their
leading items as of yore. Films pass from show to
show in varying rotations. But the rivalry in ad-
vertising continues as it was when a number of the
same pictures were screened at several places at one
time. A mutual arrangement for limiting the ex-
pense of their advertising seems inevitable, and an
out-and-out combine in the future is probable!
THE GOOD FIGHT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In the course of an interview to-day, Jack Johnson
said that Christianity was dearer to his heart than
pugilism could ever be. “I would rather have written
‘Onward Christian Soldiers,’ ” he said, “than be
heavyweight champion of the world. I will obey the
Scriptural command, and fight the good fight.”
Oh ! dear to his heart
Is the good Christian’s creed,
But he sees nothing wrong
If a bruiser must bleed,
In case he should e’er
Leave the ring in the lurch,
He would pack up his traps
And get into the Church ;
For he wearies at times of the sport and the skite,
And he only keeps going to fight the Good Fight.
Don’t suppose he does nothing
But “lower the glim”
Of his foe : in his bosom
He’s singing a hymn;
He dreams of a day
When the organ will roll,
And anthems will swell
In the depths of his soul;
And meantime he’s holding the money-bag tight,
And heeding the motto of “Fight the Good Fight.”
Such fellows as Sayers
And Iron-jawed Burge,
Knew naught of emotions
That frequently surge
In the bosom of Jack,
When he steps in the ring
And knocks out his man
With a swipe and a swing;
With a text or a biff he is girdled in might,
When he slaughters his foeman he fights the Good
Fight.
And when he steps out,
And his autumn is come,
Don’t fancy he’ll riot
In a frenzy of rum ;
In solitude pious
He'll wind up his days,
And fill in his leisure
With prayer and with praise ;
And Satan will find that his soul is pure white,
He’ll still gird on his mittens and fight the Good
Fight.

One of the chief joys of Christmas is the pleasure
of giving. How great a pleasure will be known this
year by those who present their, friends with Water-
man’s Ideal Fountain Pens, if is sheer delight to
give one; it is sheer delight to * receive one. A
Waterman’s Ideal means freedom from all pen
worries. It means no dipping in the ink-well, no
botheration about new nibs. It means a pen that
can be used at business, or at home, or when travel-
ling. It means a pen that can be carried in the
pocket with safety, ready to be used at any time,
and in any place. Waterman’s Ideal is made in
three styles: “Regular,” “Safety” (cannot leak how-
ever carried), and “Pump-Filling.” There are
pleasing variations in shape and appearance in each
style, and for presentation purposes many fine models,
exquisitely mounted in gold or silver. Whatever
price you pay (12s. 6d. and upwards), if the pen
you purchase bears the Waterman’s Ideal imprint,
you may be sure it is a perfect fountain pen. Sta-
tioners and jewellers all over the world stock Water-
man’s Ideal Fountain Pens, so there is no difficulty
in obtaining this Best Christmas Gift of all.*

IN BANANA LAND
“Petifi” : Justice Higgins, in the Austra-
lian Arbitration Court, lias decided that the
Queensland shearer is a class unto himself
in the way of speed. This superiority ac-
crues from divers causes; but, taken by and
large, the Judge reckons the Queenslander
gets there because he is a professional in
large practice, whereas the other Stater
very often is not, but only takes a pen to
fill in time, while his wheat is coming up or
his turnips are getting fit to milk.
Philp isn’t going to stand for election to
the Assembly again. Fast-diminishing ma-
jorities have given him the “straight
Griffin” that Townsville is changing its
mind; and, as he has booked himself for an
early trip to Scotland, which he hasn’t seen
for 50 years, he will very soon say “So
long!” to the House of which he is now the
father. Personally, “Bob” is about the
most popular man in the Bananaland Leg-
islature ; in fact, it was his affability which
made him such a disaster as Premier and
Treasurer.
“Leo. Lear” The Burnett and Bowen dis-
tricts are, I see, going to try to resurrect
their defunct sheep-growing industry; but
I’m backing- the corpse to stay dead. To-
wards the end of the ’O2 drought, southern-
ers re-opened the sheep trade in the Degilbo
district, contrary to all advice from old
hands. As long as the dry years lasted,
things went as well as any honeymoon;
but when the rain commenced to be reck-
oned up. again in feet, the sheep men were
hit full in the face. The chief troubles were
grass-seeds, dingoes, foot-rot and, worms, all
of which. redoubled their labors when the
Devil resigned from the meteorological de-
partment. Of the four, the last is the bar
to successful sheep-rearing on natural pas-
tures. No matter how they drenched,
changed paddocks, etc,, the southerners
found themselves up against it; and now
they have all subsided back to the cow trade.
Experience showed that the jumbucks could
be brought to the district and fattened; but
to keep them, year after year, or to breed
from them, is not only inviting disaster, but
driving- to the railway to meet it. I don’t
sav that the industry cannot be established
on artificial grasses with special brands of
sheep; some men are attempting it at pre-
sent. But the failure of other methods
tried by experienced sheepists makes me pes-
simistic.
Treasurer Barnes has just run through
the Assembly a Treasury Bills Bill, with in-
tent to provide for Treasury bills falling due
by the issue of more Treasury bills. The
£400,000 of surpluses that have been
smuggled out of existence in the last two
years would have gone a considerable way
towards meeting this indebtedness. But a
shiftless crowd wanted the money for a jam-
boree, so financial rectitude went overboard.
The Queensland Auditor-General, in his
annual report, practically admits that the
State accounts may be faked, and frankly
says that the law allows it. When Queens-
land has a surplus, the law says that it must
be applied to the reduction of the public
debt. But Treasurers have such an affec-
tion for the pawnshop, and such an unholy
dread of getting out of Isaac’s clutches, that,
when a surplus seems unavoidable, they
don't close the books, but mop up the sur-
plus by using it to pay the bills that drift
in for the next month or so. The action,
says the Auditor-General, is “strictly cor-
rect, although it is not likely to be resorted
to in a lean year.” In plain words, it means
that a Treasurer, faced with the dreadful
obligation to pay off a trifle of the State’s
abnormal debt, may dodge it by stretching
a y&ar, so that it takes in 13 or 14 months’
expenditure; or, if the Treasurer in (say)
THE PHILOSOPHY OF CLOTHES.
THE BISHOP : "But, my good man, you look strong and robust. Why do you not try and
get something to ao?"
THE DERELICT: “But, your Lordship, look at me! Who would employ me in these.rags?
Now, if you would give me a left off suit of yours I think I could get employment .”
1911 has hung things up and paid the July
bills, a Government in 1912 may dodge the
humiliation and bad advt. of a deficit, and
avoid the need to economise or to raise
more tax money, by making his year run to
only 11 months so far as expenditure is con-
cerned. Apart from the fact that this af-
fords an easy but dishonest way of fooling
the public with regard to the finances, the
net result is that, while deficits are always
liable to be added to the loan burden, sur-
pluses are not used to shift any of the load.
Posterity, in short, gets the kicks, but by
no chance gets any of the ha’pence. “I
have suggested to the Government,” says
the Auditor, “an amendment of the Audit
Act, so as to require the Treasury books
to finally close on the 30th June of each
year, but, so far, I have , not seen any sign
of the suggestion being adopted.” if the
Government is not willing to follow its ex-
pert advisfer, it might at least make the posi-
tion clear by passing a law to confirm the
present practice. “An Act to Simplify the
Faking of the Public Accounts” is sug-
gested as a short title.
“No Encumbrance.”

A N.S.W. fanner writes to the Codrier to say
that, though Queensland professes to want immi-
grants, he finds himself everywhere handicapped be-
cause he brought eight with him'Mp his family.
Now Landlord Puff is a fine big man,
With loads of Propertee;
His mansions fair and his snug wee cots
Are a lovely sight to see ; v
But in case you go to ask his terms
He makes your trespass clear:
“You have, 1 see, a Familie—
We want No Children here!’’
Sir Pure Merino owns a run
Where population’s thin,
And as his flocks and herds increase
He rakes the shekels in;
But if e’er his wretched “hands” would wed,
He shakes in deadly fear,
And bids them pack and take the track:
“We want No Children here!”
And Portly Purse whose sweet estate
Fills half the country side;
Who scarce could count in half a day
His dollars, if he tried—
He needs a married couple’s aid
To mind his mansion’s gear ;
But in this wise he’ll advertise:
“We want No Children here!”
So Loveless Wealth beside his mate
Glares on his “festive board,”
And wonders why no joy-lit eye
Surveys his treasured hoard ;
A bride of bosom opulent
He took his heart to cheer —
Perchance she caught the text he’d taught:
“We want No Children here!”
And daily by a shameless Press
The lesson home is driven
That laughing, bright-eyed babies form
A trespass unforgiven ;
Heav’ns! What a crazed and callous age
Is this whose message clear
Is carried past <on ev’ry blast:
“We want No Children here!”
’T’is written by the Plutocrat
Upon his gates of gold ;
Its virus stains with deadly blight
The sweet domestic fold ;
And yet one needs no rolling eye
Of rapt prophetic seer
The doom to spy of lands that cry:
“We want No Children here!”
QUEENSLAND.

QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, October 21, 1911.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
Next to the betting quotations at Flem-
ington, the most important item in So-
ciety’s category this week was the arrival of
Agent-General Robinson, his wife and small
daughter. They eventuated by the Orsova,
were met by the Premier and party, removed
to the Govex-nment launch Lucinda, and pre-
sented with roses, fish, ice, meat, carnations,
beer, fizz, and “Goi-save.” In return for the
enthusiasm the A.-G. handed out large quan-
tities of more or less edifying remarks on
immigration to the properly-impressed in-
terviewers. The A.-Generaless kept the end
of the function up with a few judicious con-
versationalisms on sport, Rhodes scholars,
entertaining in London, and the DoiVager
Alexandra. The Robinson lady is a youth-,,
ful Englishwoman, with fair hair and blue
eyes, which, to their misfortune, have never
before looked upon Bananaland. Finally,
she has a pretty taste in clothes. With her
wox-se half she will shortly pay a visit to the
north of the Btate.
On Thursday night Wee Macgregor care-
fully brushed his hair and took the
his triumphs at bazaars and foundation-
stones to see the Merry Widow do her worst' '
The Agent-General Robinsons were in the
sub-regal box, and all the death-or-glory
boys who could raise the wind got into shin-
ing, armor and sunned themselves in the re-
flection of the red baize.
The Docker-Wilson partnership, which
was cemented on Wednesday, attracted only
the. Best, the bride being related directly or
indirectly to every one of our Old Nobility.
Every title Queensland boasts was yarded,
and even the two-days’-returned Robinsons
were present. The bride, who is a pretty
girl, looked most attractive in white satin
and heirloom lace, and was understudied by
six snow-flake bridesmaids. I don’t remem-
ber what the bridegroom wore, except an in-
coherent air. The same afternoon another
bridegroom—Y. Madsen, Secretary of the
Public Service Board —bestowed his name
and what; lie-could spare of his worldly goods
on Miss. Lilia McKee. The wedding knots
were ..tied to the accompaniment of heavy
rain on the church roof, but that didn’t affect
the-'rejoicings, and some of it came in useful
for putting in the toasts.
Haunted Parliament House for a few
hours this week, Senator and Mrs. Lance,' of
S’Africa, era route to their home from the
Gbronation picnic. The Senator’s wife does
not regard the enfranchised Australian
woman with any noticeable amount of envy.
“Our leagues do just as much work and ac-
hieve the same results,” she said. And it
took quite a long time before I managed to
make her understand that, woman-like, it
wasn’t results we prized so much as the
possession of the vote. Mrs. Lance was born
in South Africa, and has lived for years in
the Transvaal. On the race question she
says that, so many Englishmen are marryng
comely Dutch girls that the racial trouble
will absolutely die in the course of a genera-
tion or two. .
Passed into the Beyond last Monday, Fleet
Paymaster ®. V. Pollock, a veteraA naval
jM. ’."'A.
officer, who was a cousin of Frederick Pol-
lock. the well-known English K.C., and a
relative of Prof. Pollock and Hugh Pollock
of your State. After serving in Great
Britain and South Africa, E.V. joined the
Queensland naval defence force, under his
friend, Captain Wright, in 1886. and re-
mained in it until the end. He was a pol-
ished Irish gentleman and a good officer; and
was 60 years of age when Death took a mean
advantage of a tram accident.
Miss Edith White, a pretty Toowong
maiden who has been enjoying the delights
of travel in Isaac Bull’s isle and on the con-
tinent of Europe, has returned to Brisbane,
and the hard-boiled tea and the jam sponge
that has no remorse pursueth her by day
and roosteth upon her chest by night.
By the southern-bound Orsova, last
Wednesday, there departed Prof. Gibson on
his way to Fogland. Mrs. Gibson accom-
panies him to Melbourne, where she will re-
main until Februai-y- Another voyager was
Miss Edith Gerard Anderson, who, after a
round of visits to friends in Sydney and
Melbourne, will make speed for Pari*. Miss
Dulcie Deuchai-, whose paternal parent man-
ages the Commercial Bank, also fled south
in the Orient sea-going hotel.
Next Saturday the members of the flour-
ishing Queensland Ladies’ Kennel Club will
lead round Fido, Towser and Prince by
stout strings, in the Exhibition Building.
Haven’t heard the date when the Queens-
land Ladies’ Maternity Club intends to line
up Bill and Mollie for public applause. In
fact, I think the club is long since dead
through lack of interest.
John Kirk, secretary of 'the London
Ragged Schools, is at present in Brisbane,
ana, later, goes to Bundabei’g, where Kirk,
jun., resides. The elder Kirk was knighted
by the late Edward for his efforts to amel-
iorate the distress of the small victims of
Cobden, and other short-sighted persons in
Britain.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIS JANE.
Governor Macgregor recently congratu-
lated local authorities on the
good work they did, and on the fact that
they gave their services for nothing. Twelve
months ago, Belmont Shire borrowed
£12,000 to’-build a tramway. Then it tried
to borrow £5OOO more. The Treasurer pro-
tested, but finally yielded. Now Belmont is
pleading for another £2OOO, principally on
the ground that it has bought an £lBOO loco-
motive that isn’t any good, and wants to
buy another one. And the Belmont Bumble
is only one of a very big family in Banana-
land.
“Bash”: The papers occasionally print
lists of citizens who, for one reason or
anothex - , have been relieved of their J.P.-
sliips. So far, however, I have sought in
vain for an intimation that a big N.Q.
squatter who was lately found guilty
of cruelty to an orphan lad in his em-
ploy—-in plain words, of kicking the child
in the stomach —has been officially asked to
cease representing law and order. A J.P.-
ship is a poor sort of distinction nowadays,
but at least there are some sorts of law-
breakers who should be denied membership
of the order.
“Itan”: In the Cairns (Q.) hinterland
they are still turning millions of feet of good
timber into ashes because of the high
freights ruling, while the consumer in the
southern cities is paying through the nose
for the timber that he needs. In the first
place, there has been a feverish desire on
the part of Queensland to get settlers on
the scrub lands of the Atherton —men mostly
from the dairy districts —and they cannot
wait for the time when it will be worth while
to cut the timber for the market. The scrub
must be cleared in a face, so the firestick
takes everything—-except, perhaps, the cedar
and some of the pine. If the inter-State
freights were more reasonable, the settlers
wouldn’t burn money like that. But it
only costs one-third as much to freight tim-
ber from Amex-ica as from Cairns to south-
ern ports; so, once it is decided to rush
settlement on these scrub lands, there is
practically no alternative to the firestick.


Testimony of Purchasers.
The success of the new Encyclopaedia Britannica, regarded as an efficiency appliance, must be measured by
the testimony of those average men and women who are now using it to supply their everyday need of exact
and sufficient information on all subjects. Thousands of letters have been received from the 35,000 ear y
purchasers who secured the work at the minimum price. A few typical extracts from these letters are
printed below. Read them carefully, and consider if you can afford to miss the same opportunity.
India Paper.
From Subscriber No. 1265: To me the mos
striking and, at the same time the most novel, 1
ture about the India paper edition is its handiness.
We would go to the heavy volumes of former edi-
tions and of other encyclopaedias for information
The handiness of this edition tempts us to go to it
for recreation and pleasure as well.
From Subscriber No- 51: “The opaqueness of
the India paper has appealed to me greatly.
From Subscriber No. 1381: “The paper, al-
though thin, does not show through from side to
side, so that it has all the advantages of lightness
and small bulk, without any disadvantages.
From Subscriber No. 268: ‘‘The mechanical
side of the edition is a pleasure; and I congratu-
late you on the appearance of the books, and the
idea of printing them on the, thin paper, whic
renders them so easy to handle.”
From Subscriber No. 2095: “The India paper
and limp leather binding would in themselves be
enough to warrant anyone discarding the old-
fashioned books.”
From Subscriber No. 323: “With the Eleventh
Edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica on India
paper I could be a civilised man and up-to-date and
moderately reconciled to a hard fate, even it alone
on a desert isle. But I should have to pick out an
India paper set from the wreckage ; the India paper
makes your book what no encyclopaedia worth
mentioning has been hitherto —a comfortable book
to associate with and live with. lam growing
very chummy with the Encyclopaedia,, Britannica.
With gratitude, I am
From Subscriber No. 269: “The first impres-
sion created upon my mind by an examination ot
the new limp leather edition is that it is the mos
attractive reference book ever printed, both in ap-
pearance and contents.’
From Subscriber No. 3889: “The paper, print
and binding combine to make this monumenta
work a masterpiece of bookmaking in the twenti-
eth century.”
From Subscriber No. 40: The India P ap ® r
mat transforms a cumbrous volume into a handy,
friendly book, which it is a pleasure to read, mark,
learn, and inwardly digest.”
From Subscriber No. 1899: “In sheer physical
convenience this edition does for the acquisition o
information a service similar to that, which the
electric car has done for rapid transit.’
From Subscriber No. 1653: “The new edition
in its India paper format is the IDEAL ENCYCLO-
PAEDIA ”
Illustrations.
From Subscriber No. 355 : “Even when not in-
vestigating any particular subject, I find a great
deal of pleasure in simply going through a volume
to admire the press work and the illustrations.”
From Subscriber No. 1416: “From the book-
maker’s stand, the work is everything that could
be desired, in type, illustrations, and press work,
and the India paper edition represents such advan-
tages as overcome by far all possible objections.’
From Subscriber No. 342: ‘‘The maps and
illustrations, particularly the illustrations in
colour, are remarkably fine. For instance, the
eight in colour illustrating thirty-three
specimens of pottery are the most beautiful ex-
amples of colour work that I have ever seen in any
work: of reference, and make the article on ‘Cera-
mics’ alone worth the price of the volume in which
it is published.”
From Subscriber No. 955: “I scarcely know
which feature to most admire —the lightness of
the thousand-page volumes, the quality of the
paper, the clearness of the print, the quality of
the cuts and other illustrations, the completeness
and up-to-dateness of the maps, the beauty, and
flexibility of the binding—all seem too good to be
real.”
From Subscriber No. 1417 : “While formerly
the volumes of the Britannica did not commend
themselves to me except for occasional reference, I
find the new edition on India paper so attractive—
not only in regard to outward appearance, con-
venience in handling, quality of illustration, and
clearness of type, but also on account of the satis-
factory treatment and readable style of the con-
tents —that I take up a volume whenever leisure
permits me.”
Up-to-Date.
From Subscriber No. 1403: “It gives the
best and the last word on the advance of know-
ledge.’’
From Subscriber No. 3816: “The last word on
everything new.”
From Subscriber No. 4016: “I have examined
the new edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica,
and find no decadence in this great work, which
has been broadened and corrected to a date late
enough to include the census of 1910 in its Ameri-
can statistics.”
From Subscriber No. 2724: “Having the old
Ninth Edition gives me a good chance to compare
the old and the new. They are as different as
can be, and the advance, in every way, of the
Eleventh Edition over the Ninth is really astonish-
ing.”
From Subscriber No. 4117 : “I have begun t 0
read articles on subjects with which I am familiar,
and I desire to say that they are caretu ly edited,
with valuable references, to the latest literature,
and entirely up to date.”
From Subscriber No. 52: “The method of pro-
ducing the work without extending it through
years; as heretofore, makes the volumes addition-
ally attractive on account of the feeling that they
are wholly up to date.”
"P'rom Subscriber No. 4513: “I beg to say that,
havfn ““seftTe “nSEdition ol this great work
?or mlny years. X am convinced that the
pnth Edition is as far m advance ot that as tne
learning of the twentieth century outstrips that o
the nineteenth.”
Prom Subscriber No. 342: “As an editor. I have
been particularly impressed by the, very recent in-
formation contained in the volumes. For instance,
volume 13 records the death ol Julia Ward Howe,
which occurred as late as October , .
articles examined, like those of the flying machine,
are just as up to date in information.
From Subscriber No. 915: “I consider it little
short of marvellous that you could embody so many
late changes in the book, particularly census re-
ports and other information that could not have
been in your hands until the latter part of last
year.”
Prom Subscriber No. 1210: -The fact that con-
temporary events and persons still living are in-
eluded is most sutisfuctoi y.
Literary Charm-
■cvn-m SnWriter No. 2979: “I found the con-
tents^so 1 absorbingtbat I have devoted my entire
time for miscellaneous reading to them.
From Subscriber No. 2559: “While travelling
I carry a volume with me, and find it a splendid
companion.”
•From Subscriber No. 1899: “Some of us were
a bit" sceptical about the suggestion that people
would read an encyclopaedia for pleasure, but I
find myself doing it. The difference in this respect
!■ d St and a nile of good magazines is that m
STne 1 knows wh’e'e fo foot tor what he wishes to
■From Subscriber No. C 175: “As I have taken
tho individual volumes from the shelf from time
to time I have been amazed and gratified to find
that ?n’this edition you have comprehended a con-
cise accurate, and fascinating treatment of all
activities of mankind both past and present.
From Subscriber No. 2288: “You have intro-
duced us to the delightful pastime of browsing
at ease instead of searching laboriously through
the fields in which is the sum of human know-
ledge.”
From Subscriber No. 3247: “I believe that a
P-r Pit step has been taken towards the ultimate goal
ff encyclopaedia production namely that hence-
forth the average reader will pick up the Encyclo-
pedia Britannica and read for pleasure rather
than delve among a number of enormous tomes
for information on some subject m w t hich he has
already become interested.
From Subscriber No. 52: “In fact, they are so
interesting that (I have been amused to see) my
wife be-ins to read them through, though I fear
Pe occasionally turns several pages at a time, es-
pecially when mathematical subjects are reached.’
Authoritative.
From Subscriber No. 3380: ‘‘When the reader
has finished the perusal of an article, he teels tfiat
he has consulted an authority, and not a mere com-
pilation.”
From Subscriber No. 2979: “On medical topics
I find it is not only authoritative and up to date,
but, on certain lines, far in advance of my text-
books. Before looking elsewhere I shall in the
future consult its pages.”
From Subscriber No. 2876: ‘‘One accepts the
high rank of scholarship of the Britannica as a
matter of course, from past history and from the
sponsorship of Cambridge for the new edition.”
From Subscriber No. 1939: “I feel that in pos-
sessing your valuable work I have an entire lib-
rary, and that with respect to authority it out-
weighs all other works of a similar character.”
From Subscriber No. 308 : “ The feeling which
one has that in consulting these volumes he will
obtain an absolutely authoritative opinion is alone
worth the cost of the work.”
Comprehensive.
From Subscriber No. 3359 : “The new Britan-
nica is certainly the most perfect course of general
information on all subjects that I have ever seen.”
From Subscriber No. 418: “As an army officer,
I find it invaluable by reason of the wide range of
the material articles on military subjects written
by authorities known and recognised throughout
the entire military world.”
From Subscriber No. 3816: “Packed, pressed
down, running over with authentic, authorita-
tive, up-to-date information.”
From Subscriber No. 272: “No other work of
reference for many years to come is likely to offer
such a volume of accurate and reliable information
in every department of human knowledge in such a
compact and convenient form. No library should
be without it. In fact, it would form the best
foundation for a library.”
From Subscriber No. 808: “The comprehen-
siveness of each article, written, as it is, by a man
who is an authority on the subject, is an assurance
to all of the imperial position of the Britannica in
the world of encyclopaedias.”
From Subscriber No. 802: “Universally posses-
sed, it ought to educate the race. It is the people’s
university.”
From Subscriber No. 4332: “The Eleventh
Edition of the Britannica surpasses all other
editions and all other encyclopaedias, and is a mar-
vellously good book, readable, comprehensive,
world-wide. It is the first book to consult, the
one book to own, if you can own but one.”
From Subscriber No. 2629 : “It seems incredible,
yet it is a fact, that substantially everything that
mankind knows on every subject is embodied in
this work.”
From Subscriber No. 2570: “The articles are so
complete and yet so concise, so well written, and
so manifestly authoritative, that one completes an
article with a degree of satisfaction not usual when
seeking information from common sources.”
From Subscriber No. 3725: “It is a complete
library in itself. Practically every field of human
thought and endeavour is thoroughly embraced.”

The World’s Standar
Valveless Engine.
h
Careful consideration of the prices of the FERRO
Engine will readily convince intending purchasers
that this outfit brings within their reach a plant
that has hitherto been beyond the “pocket” of many
would-be buyers. At the same time, we would like
to impress upon all that, although the Plant is low
in price, it is NOT LOW IN QUALITY. We assert,
without hesitation, that there is NOT A BETTER
ENGINE MADE than the FERRO. The low price
is accounted for by the enormous output and the per-
fect organisation of the Ferro Co., combined with
the fact that the design of FERRO Engine omits a
number of parts necessary in ordinary Oil Engines.
In all fifteen parts per cylinder are eliminated,
and all of them parts which call for greatest ac-
curacy in design and workmanship. It is evident,
therefore, that a FERRO Engine can be made of
highest class materials at a LOWER PRICE than a
Valve Operated Engine using the same grade of
material —which few manufacturers attempt.
It must also be borne in mind that the failure of
any one of the fifteen parts mentioned will throw
the Engine out of business until it is replaced, and
the FERRO has fifteen less chances of stopping when
there is work to be done.
Don’t forget this: TIME IS MONEY.
Made in the following sizes suitable for
Stationary, Portable or Marine use:

A CIGAR is the BEST
SMOKE OF ALL!
But why can’t you get a
Good Cigar in the Country?
ALL over Australasia the only places you can
buy a really high-class Cigar is in the big
cities. In the country districts a good Cigar
cannot be had; because it’s only at the pubs that
you can buy Cigars at all in the out-back districts.
The publican knows that selling liquor pays him
better. He reckons that his customers only call
for a Cigar when they ve got a few drinks in and
want to dodge getting “fu’ the noo." Any old
Cigar does for that.
So he buys a few hundred at a time from
some “back-yarder”—real “Flor de Cabbage”
with big gold pictures all over the box and
mighty pretty bands round them—made from the
waste leaf and the cheapest growths, but called
by some high-falutin’ name. (The making of these
Cigars is another story—l’ll tell you about it
another time.)
fgh
Tbestorekeeperor tobac-
conist in country towns does
not sell good Cigars either.
If he does, he has to add to
the selling price of the Cigar,
the maker's profit, the profit
of the warehouseman he
buys from, the profit of the
traveller who calls and sells
them to him, and his own
profit.
So that a good Cigar
that sells in the city at 6d.
he’d have to charge 9d. for,
and not grow fat on it then,
because the number he would
sell would be small; and
good Cigars have to be kept
in a uniform temperature,
free from exposure to the
air, or else they’ll go off.
Those are just some of
the reasons why you can’t
get a good Cigar in the
country parts of Australia,
and also why so very few
Cigars areat present smoked
in the country.
Buy a 100-box of my
'‘DIADEMAS,” smoke 5 or
6 of them, and, if they’re
not as good as any 6d.
Cigar you’ve ever smoked,
you needn’t pay a penny.
That’s the way I’m in-
troducing my Cigars into
Australia. I know Cigar-
making from A toZ. 1 know
these DIADEMAS Cigars of
mine are just the coolest,
smoothest and most luxu-
rious smoke any man could wish for. Cigar-
smokers of a lifetime say so; and the more you
know about a good Cigar the better you’ll like
them.
My DIADEMAS are made from the very
finest, mild, rich, mellow, Java leaf, the filling or
inside heart of the Cigar being all straight long
Brazilian. The Cigars are hand made by skilled
workers, and every box has to pass me before it
goes out to a customer; and is guaranteed to
burn free and draw easily. The Cigar is 4 inches
long, and the picture at the side is a copy of it,
exact in size and shape.
Now, this DIADEMAS Cigar is as good as
any 6d Cigar, sold in the cities by high-class
tobacconists, as I sell it direct to the customer —
saving the cost of wholesalers’, salesmen's, and
retailers' profit. I only charge you 22/6 the box
of 100 DIADEMAS, postage paid right to your
address.
Send 22/6 to-day, and get the box of 100
DIADEMAS by return post. In ordering, say
whether you like the mild, medium, or strong
grade. Please add exchange to country and
interstate cheques.

Happy the Man.
Happy is the man of affairs who begins the daily grind fortified
by a dish of Grape-Nuts. Three or four tcaspoonfuls of this delicious
ready cooked breakfast food, with a little cream, a little fruit, and a
couple of eggs give a vigour and nerve and brain force which
accomplishes wonders.
It keeps a man mentally well braced, and health means happiness
and a power to win, whereas the man who begins the day by clogging
his machinery with greasy, poorly cooked food, fails.
iilHt
Grape=Nuts
is fully cooked at the factory, hence
is ready for instant serving with
cream or rich milk, hot or cold.
It is a concentrated food ;
three or four teaspoonfuls are all
that are required for the cereal
part of the meal, but the satisfied
feeling after partaking of this
small quantity is surprising.
Its sustaining powers a
prominent Authority pronounces
wonderful, and he further states
that tests made by him show
that Grape-Nuts is fully digested
and passes into the system in
one hour.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I WALKED into a hardware shop to get
a pound of nails;
The manager was fighting with his
salesman on the floor ;
And somewhere on the flat above I heard t le
crash of pails,
The sudden rush of angry feet, and now and
then a roar;
The shop was fu'l of customers—share-
holders ev’ry one —
Who wanted little odds and ends, and had
no time to spare;
They fidgeted at intervals, but seemed to
‘think it fun
To see the salesman plucking out his boss s
well-oiled hair.
i hammered on the coupter with a weight
from off the scales,
And shouted, “Shop ! hurry up ! I
want a pound of nails .
No shopman hurried at the call to get my
nails for me;
The riot rather louder grew. “ I’ll Ax you
up, you cow!”
Thus spake the zealous manager, and, with a
war-whoop, he
Caught up a hoe and smote the panting sales-
man on the brow ;
The customers upon the chairs stood up and
cheered the blow ;
The bleeding salesman raised his foot and
lashed out like a horse ;
It struck the other on the belt or half an
inch below;
He shrieked with pain, and dropped, and
writhed in agony—of course.
Some customers just howled with joy,
while others uttered wails.
I banged upon the counter, and remarked,
“I want some nails !”
“You won’t get nothing here.” It was a
cheerful little man
Who told me this. I asked him “Why?” He
muttered, “I dpnno!
I’ve waited ’ere for years an’ years. / want
a billycan;
But these cows won’t attend to yer! .. . Oh,
bless me, there they go!”
Two struggling shopboys tumbled down the
shaking, narrow stair,
And fell among the garden tools to loud,
derisive hoots ;
One struggled up with straw and dust upon
his clothes and hair,
And started on bis prostrate foe to use his
hobnailed boots.
“This sort of commerce,” I remarked,
“should soon fill up the gaols!”
There came a lull. I shouted, loud, “Pro-
duce that pound of nails !”
It was an utter waste of wind. The din
once more began;
The groaning manager arose and bashed his
enemy;
The fighting shopboys broke apart and round
the counter ran;
The customers cheered, groaned and yelled,
and trod all over me;
I cursed the whole demented place, and tried
to struggle out;
I couldn’t budge—-the shop was packed, and
so I had to stay.
I asked my next-door lunatic, “Hey! What’s
it all about?”
“Dunno,” he gasped. “I just come in.
They’ve bin like this all day I
(Loud shrieks like those you hear at sea
in winter’s wildest gales.
I tried once more. I howled like mad,
“I-icant-a-pound-of-NAILS!”)
Mv final howl was never heard. I hardly
heard myself;
A liner’s whistle only could have pierced
that fiendish din;
The very nails I wanted I could see upon
the shelf,
But there was not a soul to serve —all hands
were “bogging in.”
I seized the madman at my side, and cried,
“For God’s sake, stop!
Who keeps this lunatics’ retreat, and does
he do much trade?”
“Oh bless me! don’t yer know?” he said
“It’s Jim McGowen’s shop!
An’ that there bloke he’s sittin’ on is his
assistant Wade!
They’ll keep on scrappin’ for th’ cash until
' the bizness fails !
You better make yer mind up, mate — you’ll
never get them nails!”

The Way of the Transgressor.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ m he way ° f the t rans s ressor is hard >”
I said the Rev. Evelyn Curtis.
It was Sunday night. The con-
gregation was rather frowsy, and sat hud-
dled on five rows of pine forms, looking, in
the dim light of a single, smelly oil lamp,
very like the derelicts drowsing on the
benches in the park. The Rev. Evelyn Cur-
tis was a tabby cat called upon to assume
the role'of a tiger. If the Rev. Evelyn had
been able to recognise, and willing to admit,
the limits of his character and capacity, he
would have been a happy, fat little pastor
drinking tea on tiger-skin rugs in the draw-
ing-rooms of the content and comfortable. But
he had a conscience, and here he was trying
to wear the tiger skin on which he should
have curled, purring amiably under the car-
essing strokes of circumspect elderly maiden
ladies and plump mammas, each with a
plate of cake in her other hand.
Now, a conscience is a poor substitute for
power. Conscience makes heroes of us all,
even of those of us who are not physically or
morally fitted to be heroes. These latter are
fortunate if they escape execration as fools.
In any case, they are foredoomed to failure.
Conscience made a city missioner of young
Mr. Curtis, and cast his lines along Fetter
Lane and Purdy’s Alley, and the unpleasant
intervening places prior to that tune when
health officers, building regulations, moral re-
form, and the exigencies of trade combined
to give thg. locality its present speciously re-
spectable exteriors.
“My duty is plain to me,” the Rev* Evelyn
Curtis had said. “I shall not shirk it. Is
this truly an evil place, brother.
“Is it wot?” replied Squeezer Magee, re-
formed garrotter, of a bear-like habit. »ee
here, boss, they', two fly-specked cheap
Chow eatin’ ’ouses in the alley, n both s
gotter keep hominy on the bill iv tare,
reg’lar, on account uv nearly all the cus
tomers savin’ the hominy ’abit. An evil
place? Gorstruth, there’s where hell gets
all its assisted immigrants. ,
That seemed eminently satisfactory.
Small of body, weak of limb, with a tremu-
lous heart, heroic Evelyn took up hi i slum
duties, a slave to conscience
was little better than a stable.- Behind it
Poo Mee ripened bananas, as the tenacious
hen ripens her eggs; in front an eagle
beaked Syrian ran a dark, duty ury gooas
pmnnrium as commodious as a labDiter s
van, where basket hawkers. Dagoes, Afghans,
Indians and Greeks replenished then stocks.
Evelvn preached from a rough pine pulpit to
his flock All Evelyn’s sheep were black
sheen even the ewe lambs. After two years
of hard instruction he convinced a
few that cleanliness is next t< godl ness, J t
had not persuaded any to venture into sucu
presumptuous juxtaposition. , j >* re-
“ The way of the transgressor is hard re
peated the Rev. Evelyn Curtis The Rew
Evelvn had never transgressed to the value
of the smallest coin in Chinese currency. If
the Recording Angel had

Yet their ways were not pile-carpeted , the
tender feet encountered ™ or l_t ho Brussels
roses and more bristles than .Brussels.
Their lot was hard enough and the landlord
was the hardest of the lot. °P,® L ;V n( .
lvn’s sense of duty gave him the idea that to
secure the comfort and happiness of his own
before relieving the distresses ot gangers
was a gross form of selfishness. . Not that
liis earnings gave him opportunity to be
reallv generous at home or abroad. He was
wmpelfed to be penurious even in lending to
“The way of the transgressor is bard.
The preacher reiterated his point, and drove
if in with weak blows. The smner might
secure some fleeting gratification by reasonp_
us,, wickedness, but surely and soon the inex
orable High Constable of Heaven laid a hand
UP The h back door ei of the “church” was pushed
open, admitting a gust of mouldy sweetness
from the old stock of 100 Mee, and a gn
scrambled over two forms into the centre of
the r ( ?Y“y> re wan ted, mister!” she cried.
‘^rhe k U?che S r’s dy loice faded away. He
gazed a P the girl, scarcely comprehending.
She was a dark-faced, black-haired, untidy
being, whose cheap finery was woefully be-
draggled giving her a suggestion of a middle
class wedding cake that had been out in the
ial ‘Dlarst yeh, ’urry !” said the girl vehem-
pnflv ‘Ben’s dyin\ I tell yen .
The Rev Evelyn Curtis held up two fin~
gers' and prayed ’that the peace that passeth
all understanding might rest and abide witl
the sloth-like objects hunched on tbe forms.
Then he snatched his hat, and followed t
girl out past Mee’s banana hatchery and
fiiordiuo's P ice-cream mill, formerly r hen-
house, into the affluent smells ot better
’n’ cursin’ fer a parson t’ save his
soul ’’grumbled the girl breathlessly, as she
led through the darkness. ‘ Never knew he

’n’ now he’s all fer gettin’ salvation. Want®
“go t ’ Heaven. What the ; devil would Ben
Carrol be doin’ in Heaven?”
Thev stumbled into a dark room. and the
Rev Evelyn’s right foot went through a hole
in the floor. As he wriggled from the trap
the missioner heard the roars of the dying.
If Ben Carrol was going to Heaven he was
no “Ai°n’t S one?” The voice was^al-
all St after h a e man when "he "don’t want ’em.
Curse the whole gang! Curse em all.
Ben fell back on his bed as the Pars°n
entered, and fixed Evelyn with ievensh,
blood-shot eyes. The invalid was a ghastly
object. His skin was a pale purple color,
puffed, and clammy with perspiration. A
wry mouth showed through his
moustache. The man was b ‘£; stoma b
nnd thin-limbed. He clawed like a buna
thing groping for Evelyn’s hand, to which
he clung with the frenzy of the drowning
“I’m dyin’!” he cried. “I’m goin’! Save
me soul, mister. Fer Gord’s sake, save me
S °“Has a doctor seen him?” Eve^ ya a J e< J;
The girl nodded. “He gimme a paper t

Ben climbed up the missionary s arm.
“I’m goin’ t’ Hell,” he said hoarsely. Goin
f Hell, d’yeli ’ear? I’m frightened! I’m
frightened! I’m frightened! Ben s voice
broke into a howl, but there was no need to
tell his fear. His face was wild with it
animal-like. ~ _ ,
“Let us pray, said Evelyn.
“Yes, yes,” 'mumbled Ben Carrol. Pray
—pray quick ’n’ hard, mister- hard. R
lyn put up his hands, and prayed silently.
“No'” cried Ben, with mad impatience.
“Hold me hand, ’n’ pray loud,” Evelyn
obeyed. “Louder !” cried Ben. Louder.
louder!” Evelyn raised his voice and prayea
on, and again and again the dying man cunn-
ing to him cried, “Louder —fer the love iv
Gord, mister, louder!” . , ,
When the Rev. Mr.-Curtis had prayed he
proceeded to speak a few soothing words, but
there was no comfort in soft small-talk about
his sins, for Ben Carrol —he wanted noise.

Zam-Buk Prevents Festering,
“Gathering,” Inflammation & Disease.
A cut or scratch is the gateway through which,
dangerous disease germs enter the body. When a dirty
knife, a rusty needle, a splinter or a thorn scratches
the finger, the latter is inoculated with germs. In a
few hours the finger will become hot and throbbing.
It will be painful to the touch and swell all round the
injury. A little later the wound may exhibit a whitish
appearance in the middle of the swelling, and we have
what is known as a festering or poisoned finger. The
inflammation set up by the poison may spread until the
whole hand «yid arm are rendered useless.
The only way to avoid such serious results is to
cleanse the wound, however slight, and then apply
Zam-Buk, which is a powerful antiseptic and germ-killer.
Zam-Buk is a purely herbal preparation wnich, wlien
applied to the broken skin, soothes and purifies the
wound, and then proceeds to heal with new, healthy
skin in a quick, painless, and perfect manner.
Zam-Buk, which is a unique preparation, must not
be confused with mere ointments, with wh.ch it has
nothing in common. It pays to keep a pot of Zam-Buk
always handy.
= MAN’S POISONED HAND HEALED. =
Mr. F. J. Barnett, of Perry Street, St. Peters, Sydney,
says "I am in the employ of the Australian Gas Co. as gas-
main layer, and while at work had the misfortune to injure
my hand. I treated the wound rather carelessly, thinking it
would be all right, but it became worse and-showed signs of

good. My hand grew worse and worse, and I suffered such
agony that I was forced to give up work. It was at this

said. His fingers clung to the parson’s
wrist, lie shook from head to foot, he made
croaking efforts to join in the hymn, and all
the time, yfeined, protruding eyes saw Hell
gaping, and the fiends and inferior devils
raking for him.
For two hours the Rev. Evelyn Curtis
toded over that fearful sinner, and it was
a deadly task, a task that overtaxed him
morally and physically. At length Gammy
Carrol lay still, consoled, comforted. “Gort
blime. I b’lieve I a-goin’ to Heaven,” he
whispered.
“Believe,” answered Evelyn, hoarse with
I*l ’ ' on ly have faith, implicit,
childlike faith, and your repentance will be
accepted.
( * men • Hallelujah!” murmured Ben.
Tiv s , ave ? me >. Mister—God blesh yer!”
suddenly he raised himself on his elbow,
Get out!” he barked at the girl. When the
girl had gone Ben’s snaky fingers drew liis
ghostly comforter closer. “Me soul’s saved,
u you done it. See here, I can put you
outer a good thing.” He spoke quickly,
eagerly “I can, s'elp me. ’n’ I will. Mind,
square n all, no turnin’ dorg ’n’ chinnin'
the Ds. Me ’u’ Mike the Spike had a job
ter t-night. Nothin’ pertickler serious
twasn t, jist had t’ get inter a stable ’n’ give
the Kite a hantibilious pill ’bout the size iv
a hegg. Here ’m I down ’n’ out, but Mike’s
good n well, ’n’ it’s ten nits to a trained
elephant he’ll pull the job off on his own.
lhere s a tidy lump iv glitter ’angin’ to it.
n the whole scheme was laid out simple ’n’
neat, a few at the stable bein’ bought in.
‘iwasn t harder than burglin’ a ’ot pie. The
Spike’s jist a cert. Iv course yell know the
mi! te T-- hr ?t fav’rite; seven t’ five on already,
llie Kite s stiff ez a morgue lodger, ’n’ there
am t nothin’ fer the Cup but Springer. Re-
member that name, Springer. He ain’t
known t’ ’n a dozen, he’s a mile out-
side, ’n’ 25’s t’ one can be got about him.
Watch the papers, Mister, ’n’ if the Kite’s
reported feverish get all you can collect
onter Springer. With a ’underd quid you
cud win a little heap. Gord blesh yeh, yiv
saved my soul from ’ell’s flames ’n’ damna-
tion, ’n’ I want t’ show me gratitude. Re-
member, Mister, Springer’s a dead cert, a
habsolute moral, if the Kite’s stiffened.
Now, sing t’ me.”
The Rev. Evelyn Curtis sang, and Ben
Carrol faded into a sort of sleepy stupor in
which he jumped and twitched, and clium-
mered quaintly about angels, and golden
crowns, and visions of Paradise.
The missioner went home that night with
quaking knees and a fagged brain, a worn-
out laborer in the vineyard, overworked to
the point pf collapse. Next day the weari-
ness of mind and body still clung to him,
but there was salve and balm in the con-
sciousness _that he had brought peace to a
dying penitent. So exhausted had Evelyn
been that Ben’s talk of the Kite and
Springer remained as only the confused
maunderings of a sick soul.
“The Kite off Color. Inexplicable Failure
ot the Favorite.” The black headlines on
his evening paper jolted Evelyn like a blow.
He read them again. Then he studied the
particulars. The trainer admitted there was
now little hope of getting the Kite into any-
thing like nick for the Cup. The Rev Mr.
Curtis turned hastily to the betting news.
Yes, Springer was there, low on the list, at
long odds.
Then the story was true, Mike the Spike
had succeeded in hocussing the Kite.
Springer Would probably win, and the man
wno could venture £lOO might win a thou-
sand or two. The missioner sat inert. Race-
horses, and bookmakers, and £lOO notes flut-
tered through his brain like blown leaves in
autumn.
Of course it was not to be thought of, but
what might not a good man, and a minister,
do with a heap of money. What wrongs
could be righted, what sufferings allayed,
what great works for raising the fallen in-
augurated and upheld? His wife’s pale face,
pathetic in its patient strength, fluttered
by, and the landlord’s, red, grim, inexorable.
’Twas a black sin, but still one’s mind might
dally with the idea, seeing only the glorious
possibilities beyond. Tainted money! Yes,
but is not all money tainted? Is there one
coin a month from the Mint that has not
rewarded a nefarious need, or been the price
of some rascality? As for himself, he had
never made a bet in his life, and could show
you 50 sermons in which the sin of gambling
was condemned with all the fervor consist-
ent with good breeding. In any case, he had
not a pound in the world. There was a little
over £lO7 in the bank. That was part of the
Newsboys and Hawkers’ Hall Fund, of
which Evelyn was sole custodian. But it
was only a coincidence that he should think
of that. Still, it appeared that the righteous
sometimes had a hard row to hoe. and money
stood for the greater glory of God, miscall
it how you might.
The sth of November in the year of
Springer. Because nature had not been spar-
ing of wheat and wool in far places, the
sons of the daughters of the children of
Israel were desperately busy gathering-
manna under the elms at Flemington. Crim-
son-visaged, red-eyed, fierce, raucous and
swamped in perspiration, the bookmakers
battled with ten thousand contending’Chris-
tians who strove to smother them with
money. Inconspicuous among the punters
was a small, shabby man with a mat of
short, crisp, nut brown whiskers and a slouch
hat. He moved furtively through the crowd,
making inquiries of the bagmen in a diffi-
dent and anxious manner, and putting “ten
pounds on Springer, if you will be so good
with the bashful air of one asking great
benefits.
The person with the nut-brown beard
went to different bookmakers. When he
made his bet he put the card carefully in an
envelope, jotted the name, complexion, loca-
tion and general characteristics of the man
behind the bag, and stowed the envelope
away in a buttoned pocket.
Then the nervous man sought an out-of-
the-way corner, and sat on the grass, with
his face to the wall. He remained so, for
over an hour.
Springer won the Cup, and the small man
went about collecting bis winnings, more
like a machine than a sentient creature.
Presently he found his pockets bulged and
gaping with money. Still numb, with staring
eyes 'and fingers that twitched, he walked
across the lawm, seeking. He came upon a
boy with a tan handbag.
“Boy,’ he said, huskily, “I will give you
20s. for your bag.”
The little man hastened away with his
purchase. In the secluded corner he stuffed
bis winnings into the bag, and then resumed
the taking up of the collection. Some of the
bookies cursed him for his delay. He did
not heed them. He was horribly wound up
to a set task, and he went through it like a
person in a nightmare.
When his work was accomplished, clutch-
ing his tan bag with a force sufficient for a
great burden, little man made for the
railway gates. Of the thronging people, the
common passion, the sweeping horses in a
swelter of sunshine and golden dust, he was
conscious only as a turbulent sea that beat
about him and stormed in his ears. The
gates were closed. He waited, standing
against them, stupidly patient. Back under
a willow a second man waited. The second
man limped. He had a pallid, flabby face
and a stubble of moustache that failed to
mask a mouth like that of an old ape. For
a long time this man had been following the
tan bag. He rode in the same train back to
town, followed it through Melbourne to
Prince’s Bridge, and took the same suburban
train. They were far ahead of the rush, and
the train had few passengers. At a stopping
place a woman in the intervening compart-
ment got out, and when the train started
again, the follower clambered into that com-
partment. In the third compartment of the
carriage, with his back to the partition, sat
the brown-bearded punter, his treasure on
his lap, clinging to it with both hands.
A sand-bag knocked the punter on his face
between the seats. The lame man clambered
over the partition, and struck again. llis
victim lay very still. The lame man raised
the other, and sat him in the corner again,
propping his head against the window, jerked
down a blind or two, and seized the tan bag.
A moment he paused Tor a last look at his
victim. The little man's mat of false beard
had broken away, and hung quaintly from
one ear.
“Se’p me Gawd!” said Ben Carrol, “it’s
the little parson what Saved me soul.”
The thief clambered back to his own com-
partment. At the next station he left the
train, carrying the tan bag, and took tram
back to the city. But, huddled in a corner,
with his false beard ludicrously awry, the
Rev. Evelyn Curtis travelled on.
EDWARD DYSON.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
r WATCHED the first loud dawning of
the world,
lied through strange vapors o’er the
formless hills
And mystic-shadowed sea. Black waves up-
curled
Broke like a foam of blood upon the shore,
And all the air was full of nameless ills,
Pestilent, stifling, o'er the sullen roar
Of drowned volcanoes in the waters hurled. J
Fear was on land and ocean, and the bare
Bibbed surface of the fire-tormented
strand
Shuddered as if in travail. On the air
Wild cries of pain like birds of horror
flew,
And writhing shapes gnawed at the bitter
sand
Like soul-cursed worms in torture. Then
I knew
Strange melody of peace, for you were there.
Vague and unfashioned through the gather-
ing light,
I felt the kind, dark splendor of your eyes
Draw me above the liorror. On the height
We stood soul-naked, elemental, fair,
Star-simple in our love, and wonder-wise ;
YY nile all the flaming heralds of the air
Rejoiced in triumph o’er the fall of night.
We were together when the hills were green
About an island in a purple sea.
Of bleating flocks we reigned as king and
queen,
Piping on reedy straws the livelong day.
Life was a summer dream of ecstasy. . .
Long cloudy shadows on the mountain
way,
Long thoughts that robbed the waters of
their sheen.
A little city on the wrinkled steep,
A quiet altar in a place of trees,
Nights that were sweet with thymy-scented
sleep,
Days that were fragrant with your shining
hair. . . .
Oh, breathe again, wind of the Grecian seas,
The Powers are plucked and all the hills
are bare,
Fled is the shepherd, scattered are the
sheep!
You came to me when all the world was
grey;
YY e walked together in the sobbing night,
Hand clasped in hand, along the trodden way
Of the unheeding city. Then you found
A little room—all holy, warm and bright,
Full of heart’s trophies and the pleasant
sound
Of home’s caressing music night and day.
The fight was sore without; but you within ;
High courage held me. So I went and
came
Amid the rolling wheels and ceaseless din
Of bloodier swordless battle. Wounded
oft,
I might not sink at last to utter shame. . . .
Your eyes, dear God, your eyes, your
bosom soft. . . .
YVhite saint, forgive, my soul is seared with
sin !
Enlialoed in the sunset of the world,
Flaming along the crests of the dead hills,
I yet shall find you. Banners, flame-
unfurled,
Blood-red about the horror of the shore,
aye in the wind to such a doom as thrills
lhe myriad seas their waters to outpour
In one mad imprecation Godward hurled.
YVe shall not fear, dear heart, the headlong
night
That rushes downward from the smoking
skies.
(jive me your hand—here on the world’s
last height
We watch together, elemental, fair,
Mar-simple in our love, and wonder-wise
Twin at first—at last. The trumpets
blare!
God yields to darkness His white crown of
light!

1— It uses cheap lamp oil (such as kerosene), and other residuals.
2 The oil is injected directly into the cylinder, thus dispensing with unre-
liable and inefficient vaporisers.
3 It is very simple in construction, there being no electric ignition or other
complicated mechanism. • '
4 Its speeds are such that electric generators and centrifugal pumps may
be coupled direct.
5 No skilled labor is required, the supply of fuel and lubricant being all
the attention necessary.
