Don't be caught with a machine-shaped system
when you could have a system-shaped machine.
We’ll talk to you about accounting machines if you
wish, but we'd much sooner discuss what you want
out of your accounting system. That way, you’ll get a
system tailored to your needs and an NCR machine
tailored to your system. And you’ll avoid the risk of
installing an accounting machine which expects you to
adapt your procedures to its capabilities.
When you buy an NCR data processing system you get
more than just the hardware. A vital part of every NCR
installation is the supporting software. (The term “soft-
ware” describes all the supporting services a manu-
facturer of “hardware” supplies to customers.) It’s
designed to ensure that NCR machines handle applica-
tions efficiently. It's tailored to help solve customer
problems, to simplify installation, and to facilitate
training of users. The term is relatively new but the
concept is not; NCR has placed strong emphasis on
such services for many years.
Because NCR has always stressed a systems approach
to business problems rather than a machine approach,
we can offer today many advanced customer aids.
NCR Data Processing representatives are known as
systems specialists because they are trained in good
business methods as well as in equipment capabilities.
They are backed by the accumulated experience and
ideas of NCR Systems Research teams, who in turn
have access to world-wide NCR experience gained
through operations in over 100 countries.
For an individual "system measurement," call your
local NCR office, or write to NCR, Box 2626, G.P.0.,

ONE MORE
WEEK
RISING IN THE NORTH
THE WAY things are going w r e can
stop worrying about the break-up of
the British Commonwealth and start
worrying about the end of the United
Kingdom. Not only are Scottish
Nationalists getting into Parliament and
the Welsh objecting to the Prince of
Wales going to their university without
complying with entrance requirements,
but in David Jones’ basement we found
large tins of biscuits, “Made in the
Ancient Kingdom of Northumbria.”
SPREADING THE WORD
THE FOUR-HOUR parade in Red
Square, w'hich marked the fiftieth anni-
versary of the October Revolution, was
a modest exercise in public relations
compared with the w'ay that the Soviet
Union has sold the idea of its cele-
brations to the West.
The ten days that shook the w'orld
w'ill spread over six months or more
before the last shot in the publicity
campaign is fired. American and other
overseas magazines began their cele-
brations of the event as long ago as
August. Paramount, w'hich made a
documentary, “The October Revolu-
tion,” w'ith the help of the Soviet and,
somew'hat surprisingly, with financial
help from the Hachette company of
France, couldn’t wait for November
7 to release its film.
“The October Revolution” won’t,
how'ever, get to Australia until the New’
Year. By then, w'e will have already
seen the BBC tw'O-part documentary,
which the ABC is running, “The World
Turned Upside Dow'n,” and the
Granada one, made for $250,000 with
British and Russian finance, “Ten
Days that Shook the World,” w'hich
Channel 9 in Sydney showed last Sun-
day, so those fountains splashing outside
Imperial palaces and Chekhov scenes
of Court life w'ill become very familiar.
What is nicely ironic is that the
Russians should have made this inter-
national publicity coup with material
which mostly ignores the fact that
Lenin and Trotsky ever had intentions
of international revolution. The Para-
mount film totally ignores this aspect.
The simple message for filmgoers is
that the Russians w'ere poor and
oppressed, but now' they are much
better off and, in fact, are getting more
like us every day.
How'ever, as the British “New' States-
man” points out: “Admittedly every-
thing isn’t yet perfect in the U.S.S.R.,
and every American writer deplores
the fact that Russia does not hold
American-type elections. How'ever, to
reassure us even on this point, the
‘Look’ team declares after an investi-
gation in depth that it is sure that the
Communist Party w'ould secure a com-
fortable majority if free elections w'ere
held in the Soviet Union. Messrs.
Breznhev and Kosygin may not yet
have universal suffrage in Russia but
they at least have the benefit of an
important American periodical’s
opinion pcfll.”
HIGH LIFE IN THE WEST
IN THE RUSH for other things, Perth
has missed out on a really
first-class new' hotel for those large
numbers of overseas visitors in transit
to Western Australian developments,
many of whom these days don’t even
take a look at the eastern States.
The Chevron Idilton w'ould have
done the trick but this project died at
birth. However, by this time next year
the matter wfill have been fixed by
the Londoner w'ho seems to have been
in the forefront of so much of West-
ern Australia’s lucrative pioneering
Sir Halford Reddish, head of Britain’s
Rugby Portland Cement group. He is
the main shareholder in St. George
Investments, who bought Perth’s elegant
but aging Hotel Adelphi and the adjac-
ent flats for SIJ million. Another big
shareholding is with the McAlpine
family, who control London’s Dor-
chester. The group knocked down the
flats and are building the new' balcony-
winged Adelphi on the river side of
the old one. In w'hite chip marble the
s3]-million hotel wall glitter in the
sunlight and be floodlit at night. It
will have 264 bedrooms and the ninth
of its 12 storeys will have eight luxury
suites.
The next move will be for the com-
pany to knock dow'n the old Adelphi
after the new' one opens in November
and start on an office block planned
to go to 20 storeys. The whole of
the ground floor will be a piazza off
St. Georges Terrace with the offices
starting at the first floor.
OUT OF OFFICE
THIS WEEK when John Armstrong
ceased being Sydney’s Lord Mayor, fol-
lowing the State Government’s sacking
of the Sydney City Council and re-
drawing its boundaries, he also had to
give up some jobs that went with the
office. He is no longer on the State
Planning Authority or the Overseas
Forces Welfare Fund or the Opera
House Trust.
But some Opera House Trustees
don't want to lose him; there are two
vacancies on the Trust and they have
suggested that John Armstrong would
fill one of them pretty well. However,
neither ex-Lord Mayor Armstrong nor
the Opera House Trust seems to be
very high on the Government’s popu-
larity poll at present and you can get
odds about the time it will take the
Opera House Trust (average age 66)
to go the way of the City Council.
Armstrong will still have plenty to
do. Apart from family business inter-
ests (which he says he has neglected
for the past tv\-o years), he is chairman
of National Properties, the developer
company that is in the news this week,
and of Nile Textiles. He is also a
director of Sir Norman Rydge’s picture
theatre-office equipment company,
Amalgamated Holdings Ltd., and T. J.
Dorgan Ltd.
NEW LIFE
SYDNEY’S 173 wine saloons, sad
habitats of winos and plonkies, are
making a second debut this time as
discotheques, bistros, taverns . . .
you name it, they’re called it. No new
wane licences have been granted in
N.S.W. since 1919, when the Licensing
Reduction Board came into being, but
it’s not difficult to buy up an old saloon
and, under new management, bring it to
life, 1967 style.
Most of them have a long bar with
ALL THEIR OWN WORK
I would not mind going back to Aus-
tralia at all, although probably not on
this trip.

and plastic grapes, a dark room for
dancing lit by garish red lamps, and
most have entertainment trad jazz
bands, rock groups, female impersona-
tors depending on the general tone
of the establishment.
They’re open from 3 p.m. to 10 p.m.
on weekdays, and from 1.30 p.m. to
10 p.m. on Saturdays, keeping to the
prevailing liquor laws. They all have
Australian wine licences only, and
serve wine in flagons or by the glass.
The best of the bunch is John Huie’s,
down in the historic Rocks area near
Circular Quay, and Martins, just past
Taylor Square. Ex-advertising man
John Huie calls his wine bar a
“tavern,” and being one of the few to
serve meals as well as wine he can
open his at lunchtime.
Union Jacks flap from his ceiling
and the walls are covered with cus-
tomers’ graffiti, rather like the chick-
peas bars fashionable at present in
New York.
The writing on the walls ranges from
the esoteric: “Where is my then that
was before now and I am gone
Praxiteles.” Through the political:
“Where is Lee Harvey Oswald now that
we need him?” To the specific: “A
bird in the flat is worth two in the
bush.”
The bar at John Huie’s is encrusted
with business cards from the solicitors,
advertising men, businessmen, and sales-
men who visit the tavern for a curry
or spaghetti bolognaise at lunchtime or
join the regular clientele of musicians
listening to trad jazz from groups such
as Phileas Mcßluit’s Emancipated Ram-
part Footwarmers’ Jug Band in the
evenings.
The idea is by no means new. Sydney
is merely stepping into line with Paris
and New York, where bars and taverns
have been a feature of the drinking
scene for years.
FALLING ON DEAF EARS
THIS WEEK ABC Radio broadcasts
its usual number of diverse programs,
each of interest to some people: ac-
companist Gerald Moore’s farewell con-
cert at Royal Festival Hall; a half-
hour of the Dudley Moore Trio; a
Quality Street program devoted to
Herman Melville; Anna Neagle talking
about her life in the British theatre;
the last of Robin Boyd’s Boyer Lec-
tures in which he discusses the Austra-
lian character.
Any of these would have been item-
ised in the daily papers, as, for instance,
“Dudley Moore Trio.” We would not
have discovered that he is the Moore
of “Beyond the Fringe” and “Not
Only But Also,” in which he played
a mean jazz piano; nor that his guest
artists included Dakota Staton. And
so with the other four programs men-
tioned.
This illustrates the paradox of radio
and its listeners: that while the medium
proliferates listening posts beyond the
—rrrrrn-^r —u.vann — m —mu imuh —4 I FU,Uuu
radios produced in Australia last year
to 251,000 TVs) it is almost impossible
to know the day’s programs in advance
and listen selectively. That may be fine
for commercial radio, which gives out
almost interchangeable music and talk
from a number of stations. But it is
death to ABC Radio and its listeners,
unlikely to find Britten and Lawrence
Welk, or Ric Hutton reading poet
Donald Davie and Jessie Matthews talk-
ing about “Mrs. Dale’s Diary,” inter-
changeable.
The ABC, fortunately, seems con-
scious of its problems. For some years
it has offered a little publication, “Pro-
gram Guide,” on subscription at $3.45
a year, post free. It has an unstated,
but certainly fractional circulation.
More recently it has been on sale for Sc-
at “selected newsstands,” which prove
hard for the buyer to select. From De-
cember 1 it will become a little bigger
and better for 7c a copy at, perhaps,
a few more “selected” stands. Who
knows, it may even put out a poster,
(>!' be mentioned in “TV Times.” Pro-
Everyone listens to radio
bably it will not be publicised on ABC
Television, because there have already
been a few letters complaining about
ABC-TV program trailers, although it
would surely be valid for ABC-TV to
mention ABC Radio more often than
once at close-down time.
Perhaps, in view of ABC Radio's
communications gap, a few hundred of
us should write stern letters to the ABC
demanding more and better radio pro-
gram information. The Commission
takes such fearful notice of its critics
whose grounds for complaint seem
reasonable, so perhaps it would be
shocked into action by letters of praise
demanding more information of radio
programs we would not want to miss?
Even a brief program trailer on ABC-
TV, early in the night, outlining the
best programs and times on ABC Radio,
would bring radio and television into
complement as perhaps they should be.

The gardening
sub-culture
THERE ISN’T the same social cachet that
attaches to having a house grand enough to
be thrown open for a charity inspection, but
opening your garden is the next best thing
these days. Charities, ever alert to new fund-
raising ideas, are delighted by the trend.
Proud owners of the gardens are happy, too,
living as they do in surroundings others
come to admire, and all in a good cause.
For the crowds who make the weekend
round of “open” gardens, especially in
spring, the aesthetic interlude is well worth
the small charge usually made. After all, it’s
nearly as good as getting to see inside some-
one’s house.
Garden inspections for charity are now very
much in vogue. Horticulturally speaking, it’s
a way to keep up with the Joneses
Charges for garden inspections are nominal,
the pleasures unbounded, for elderly folk


A romp for the kids while Mum and Dad drink in the spring beauty of someone else’s labors. But garden clubs report that

Other cares can be forgotten in a garden, among the guelder
roses, the flowering cherries, and the blaze of annuals. And

Australians
expect
better
plastics
products
like this kitchenware, made out of
Hostalen
The quality of the plastics products you can buy is quickly
improving because of the raw material Hostalen.
Take these kitchen plastics. Because they are made out of
Hostalen they are rigid and strong, yet won’t break or
crack if you drop them. When you fill them with boiling
water or heavy loads, they won’t bulge out of shape.
They are hygienic and extremely easy to clean. They are
colorful, beautiful, modern in design. Hostalen high
density polyethylene is the top quality plastics raw
material developed in Germany and now produced in
Australia.
Manufacturers who use Hostalen make top quality
plastics products. The shop that sells them is changing its
ideas about plastics products and wants to give you the
very best.
You deserve better things made out of plastics, so it’s
really worth asking for the ones made from Hostalen.
LOOK FOR THE LABEL
Hostalen is manufactured in Australia by:- HOECHST CHEMICALS (AUSTRALIA) LIMITED and distributed by:-

BATMAN’S
MELBOURNE
Some imported
fillies just
aren't stayers
IT WAS IN 1962 that the VRC actu-
ally gave up running horses in the Mel-
bourne Cup. This was the year that the
club switched to females. The new name
was “Fashions in the Field” contest
and the racebook listed a series of
events. The first race was the Maiden
Stakes for Fillies wearing ensembles
worth £4O and under, the second race,
the Improvers’ Handicap, was for mares
in ensembles worth £BO and under, and
there was the straight gallop for girls
in ensembles of any price.
The races were run over a beautiful
track, a furlong wide lined with roses,
and 1£ miles long in front of the
grandstands. The Melbourne Cup was
timed for 2.40, but the keen fillies in
the fashion stakes always found it
smarter to be there by 10 a.m. A smart
girl has to know her edition times and
in the deadly serious competition for
the front page of the “Herald” it is wise
to get yourself photographed by 11 a.m.
Once the VRC had decided to con-
centrate on this unique idea of using-
females, it could not afford to let the
contest remain static. Every year had to
be an improvement on the one before.
Imported bloodlines were necessary.
In 1963 the club invited the English
sensation “the Shrimp” and the racy
French filly Christine Borge. The
Shrimp won by the length of the
straight and came in so well that the
news went around the world, and the
London “Daily Mirror” became so ex-
cited it even hot-footed a columnist to
Melbourne between the running of the
Derby on Saturday and the Cup on
Tuesday.
In 1966 the VRC brought out a New
Zealand-born stayer of English stock,
the Baroness Thyssen, estranged filly of
the Baron Thyssen. She performed ex-
cellently. Old favorites like Tulloch
never got such publicity. But the pace
was set. Every year the club felt it had
to go one better. Whom would they im-
port for 1967? There were many sug-
gestions Brigitte Bardot, Baroness
Von Fuerstenberg, and at one stage
even Princess Anne was on the short list.
The total prizes for fashions in the
field went to $24,000 and the booty for
females was beginning to rival the loot
provided in the old days for horses.
Then it was with great excitement that
we learned that the prize import for
1967 would be Her Highness Princess
Soraya Esfandiary, former Queen of
Persia. (We specialise in estranged and
former wives.)
But that wasn’t all. There were six top
models from London. It was felt that
in cold weather on a heavy track these
English pacers would perform particu-
larly well. There were 30 girls from
New Zealand and it was with a feeling
of pride that the VRC was able to
announce that female imports from
N.Z. exceeded equine imports.
There were three superb entries from
Sydney. These girls were very tall,
taller than the English imports, and
turf experts acknowledged that, con-
sidering the size of their micro-minis,
they would show a lot of form on the
track.
The stakes were attractive for Prin-
cess Soraya. The Hotel Australia
specially decorated a suite. She was to
open the new 14-storey Queens Lodge
Motel, and here there was to be a
$3500 banquet and her portrait had
been specially painted in oils. Mel-
bourne firms had donated over $lO,OOO
for the Children’s Medical Research
Foundation and for the Princess herself
there was a gift of a lambswool rug
of marvellous texture so thick royal
legs would sink right up to the fetlock.
It was 14 feet square, big enough for
a large room.
You must appreciate that Cup Day
is a sacred event in Melbourne. Other
grave days like the Queen’s Birthday
“At this rate I don’t know WHAT I’ll
wear next year!”
and Anzac Day are nothing in com-
parison. We are the only people in
the world who close the Stock Exchange
and give a public holiday for a contest
between females. This Tuesday a jury
was even allowed to go into recess so
that it could hear the event, so can
you fully appreciate the shock wave
that went through our city when it was
announced that the favorite, Princess
Soraya, was scratched? She was ill,
said the report. But could anyone on
earth be ill enough not to want to
come to Melbourne on the first Tuesday
in November, we felt.
How did it come about? We heard
that there were several differences of
opinion with the VRC. General Motors
was to provide three Pontiacs with
chauffeurs to be placed at the lady’s
disposal. The Princess wanted Mercedes
Benzes. Two evening functions were
planned, one a private party to be
attended by the Holts, no less. The
Princess wanted to attend only one. It
was also said that she did not like to
rise before 11 a.m. Glory be, even the
Governor-General was arriving at the
Cup at 11 a.m. The VRC said firmly it
could not alter any of the aforesaid
arrangements. Then the Princess, ill in
bed in Sydney, was scratched.
Victoria reacted with dignity. Mr.
Tom Colebrook for the VRC: “I can
state officially that the Cup will still
be run.” Mr. Hilton Nicholas said:
“We are unworried. We will drink to
the health of absent friends.”
Mr. Nicholas was asked to comment
on the report that the Princess had
said: “I never said I would go to
Melbourne.” There is no need to give
his full reply here. It was brilliantly
succinct, just two short, sharp words.
The money was all donated just the
same. A 14ft. rug went to the Re-
search Foundation and the Soraya rug
went to our Royal Children’s Hospital.
As for the portrait of Soraya at the
motel, the managerial comment was:
"'lt ought to be burned.”
But has the switch from horses to
females been a success? It is hard to
tell. In 1961, the year before Fashions
in the Field, the Cup attendance was
82,415, and total carnival attendance
182,025; in 1962, 91,293 and 198,000;
in 1965, 74,300 and 181,000; in 1966,
82,200 and 183,800; and this year for
the Cup we had 84,000, which certainly
does not compare with the Centenary
Year of 1960, when 101,475 turned out.
However, attendances for big meet-
ings have been well down in Sydney
and without girls they might well be
down in Melbourne. So already we are
planning for next year. Whom can we
get? Richard and Liz? Or dare we?
Do you think she might? How about
Jackie Kennedy? She can scratch at the
last minute if she likes. The publicity
would still be beaut.

Meanwhile,
back at
Bellevue Hill
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
THEY DON’T KNOW how she can.
It’s so brave of Mrs. Roy Coote to
lend her Bellevue Hill, Sydney, home
for the Melbourne Cup junket, all
proceeds to Peter Pan Kindergarten,
this time for poor old La Perouse, half-
Aboriginal, and not posh old Paddo as
everyone seems to think is the case.
Please mention this, says president
Mrs. Joan Hill, we do want people to
know.
So into Mrs. Coote’s tasteful
residence pour three hundred women,
a handful of husbands, mostly vintage,
and a clutchful of interior decorators
and travel agents, regulars on these
occasions, and they swarm all over the
landscaped gardens with harbor views
greeting one another with little social
cries of pleasure. At the same time
bagging the best tables covered by
AJC-striped umbrellas and laden with
David Jones’ china and cutlery for
lunch.
For the seventh year running, Mrs.
Coote stands in her drawing-room re-
ceiving guests. There is a crash of glass
by the Boutique crammed with goodies
for Chrissie and she moves unemotion-
ally forward with dustpan and brush.
The same person falls down with the
sweep money jar every year, says a
committee member; they’ve got used
to it now. They wait for it.
This, actually, is the one lunch that
all the girls come to consistently. You
know, cut the others out, but this is a
must. Even after last year’s incident,
when some people didn’t feel too good
next day, well, it was hot and the fish
did have to travel from members’
Bellevue Hill refrigerators, even after
this the turnout, as they say in
theatrical/charity circles, is capacity-
full. Mrs. Hill reckons on at least
$2200 profit.
There is much raising and lowering
of Audrey Hepburn sunglasses, summer
1967’s answer to the lorgnette, and
divine worn like those models do on
top of the head. Mrs. Valerie Sturzen
holds court in her navy-blue-and-white
check Chanel original. A social-page
girl leans over and says may she ask
whom it’s by? She may. Mrs. Sturzen
is one of the most photographed women
in Sydney. She has the required Social

Face. There's Lady Portarlington in
her pink John Cavanagh wearing, for
heaven’s sake, not one but two watches.
Trad gold on the left wrist and mod
plastic on the right.
Lady Spender’s in stop-red hat and
go-green dress, and near her sits a bouf-
fant blonde in caution-orange culottes
with white kid boots. “Yooooooo-

girl knee socks and little-boy navy

dahling. And on the tables are hair-
dresser Alexander’s skinny chic black-
and-white matchboxes, made in Japan;
they don’t extinguish under the dryer.
. . well, Fm not going there any
more. I said it’s too bad, are you going
to do something about it or not? I said,
and they didn’t . . .”

Venet, Madame Henriette Lamotte in

dozens of Sydney sub-matrons rushing
around in pinnies serving food which,
this year, is meat.
There are other Melbourne Cup
parties going on, of course, but at the
Golf Club, for instance, there is noth-
ing like this sort of atmosphere. There,
says a member seriously, we don’t need
to dress up and wear hats and things.
It’s not necessary for us. We like a
quiet, relaxed lunch.
Well, they miss Brigadier Fergus
MacAdie’s delivery from Mrs. Coote’s
upstairs veranda of who’s drawn what
horse. It’s so sexy everyone stops stuff-
ing pineapple salad and says w'ho’s that?
He should be on television. For heav-
en’s sake, growth the Brigadier. And
the mad, feminine rush round tables
and over marquee guy ropes to get
to one of Mrs. Coote’s strategically
placed three 23-inch screens.
And the oohs when one goes on the
blink, the aaahs wdien it returns to
normal. And the shrieks when Red
Handed wins, the abandoned dances of
ecstasy and otherwise. Hoo-roo for
Monica! She wins $2OO. Lucy $lOO. And
some man $BO. The 20-cent and 50-cent
sweep winners say where the hell do
they get their money? And a woman’s
voice screeches wall someone turn that
television off, she has an announcement
to make. Notwithstanding all this female
cacophony, Sir Stanley Burbury, chair-
man of the Voyager Royal Commission,
is heard telling a guest he much prefers
seeing the Cup here than in Melbourne.
At five o’clock, helpers are still slog-
ging to return Mrs. Coote’s house to
its former glory, and her garden, too.
Mrs. Hill says it took three months
organising this; right now she’s collect-
ing her silver and going home.
Mrs. Coote doesn’t want to talk about
it . . .

Now aluminium rules the deep by force of its strength,
versatility, and resistance to corrosion!
When the R.A.N. wanted twenty new
vessels for patrol work around
Australia's northern coastline and
Pacific Islands, it had a problem.
What metal to use in the super-
structure? The metal had to be light,
strong, and as near maintenance-free
as possible. Aluminium was the answer.
Besides being light and tough, an aluminium
superstructure gives the vessels a lower
centre of gravity, which means greater
stability. And because of aluminium’s
extraordinary corrosion resistance,
maintenance is practically nil.
Being constructed in Queensland, each vessel
will be 107 ft. long with" a2O ft. beam,
and will incorporate more than 3.5 tons
of aluminium in the superstructure, funnel
casing, and fittings below deck.

Somebody up
there in Sweden
dislikes us
BY ROSS CAMPBELL
THE TIME HAS come to say this
bluntly Australia is not getting a fair
deal from the people who hand out
the Nobel Prize for Literature. The
honor has been spread around many
countries in recent years. Guatemala
(Miguel Asturias), Israel (Samuel
Agnon), Italy (Salvatore Quasimodo),
Chile (Gabriela Mistralo), Yugoslavia
(Ivo Andrich), Iceland (Haldor Lax-
ness), and Switzerland (Hermann
Hesse) have all been given the nod. But
Australia, as so often happens, is at the
end of the line.
I am not suggesting that these Prize-
winners are without literary merit.
Miguel Asturias who, as the Nobel
people put it, writes “prose of fire”
is one of my favorite authors; I always
buy his latest work when I am pass-
ing through Guatemala. On long win-
ter evenings there is nothing I like
better than to curl up with a volume of
Agnon or Quasimodo.
Some of the authors chosen are,
perhaps, a little too “pop.” In the
train one often sees a businessgirl
deep in a best-seller by Gabriela Mis-
tralo or Ivo Andrich. But Nobel
writers are generally worth reading. My
complaint is that Australia has high-
class writers, too, and they never see
the color of Nobel money. (It is good
money something over $A40,000.)
Robert Graves lately made some un-
kind remarks about Nobel Prize win-
ners, whom he regards as has-beens. I
do not go along with that. The works
of Juan Jimenez (Spain), George Sef-
eris (Greece), and Saint John Perse
(France) still hold for me the same
degree of fascination as in the past.
Perhaps Mr. Graves was influenced
by personal pique. He said he had been
short-listed for the Prize several times,
then eliminated in the finals.
I would guess that if Mr. Graves is
ever awarded the honor, he will have
too much sense to refuse it. The only
writer to do that was Jean-Paul Sartre.
His eccentric gesture was a proof of
Sartre’s integrity. A man who not only
has for his steady girlfriend the
loquacious Simone de Beauvoir but
declines to accept a cheque for
$A40,000 must be absolutely sincere
in his determination to be miserable.
The allocation of Nobel Prizes in the
scientific field is fairer, and a couple
of them have come Australia’s way.
Science is more international than
literature. When a research worker does
something spectacular like Pedro
Bananos, the Nicaraguan biologist who
transplanted the reproductive organs of
a mosquito to a flea the importance
of the achievement is immediately
obvious.
The committee which awards the
Nobel Peace Prize has a harder task.
Occasionally it has blundered for
example, in discouraging the move
made some years ago to nominate Walt
Disney. But more often the Peace Prize
committee has shown the soundness of
its judgment by not awarding the Prize
at all.
Dissatisfaction has centred mainly on
the awards for Literature. To be just,
one should make allowance for the
difficulties confronting the Swedish
Academy, which has to reach the
decisions. A heavy strain is placed on
the members’ linguistic attainments.
One of them, Volvo G'ustafkvist, had
a nervous collapse while trying to read
a novel in Polish, a book of Albanian
love-lyrics, a philosophical work in
Afrikaans, and a Portuguese detective
story.
It was this crisis that led the
Academy to switch to a geographical
system. The members bought a large
atlas, and picked out a country for the
award each year. 1967 was Guatemala’s
turn. A few inquiries elicited the infor-
mation that Miguel Asturias, of that
region, wrote prose of fire; so he got
the Nobel Prize for Literature.
I am not objecting to the geographi-
cal system of awards it probably
saves some quite decent Swedes from
going crazy. The disturbing thing is
the hemispherical bias displayed. No
author south of the equator has hit the
Nobel jackpot since Chile’s Gabriela
Mistralo in 1945. Surely some discreet
pressure could be applied by the Aus-
tralian Government. After all, we are
quite good customers of Sweden we
buy their machine tools, air compres-
sors, paper, cars.
When questioned, the Swedes say to
Australians: “Be patient. Your turn for
the Prize will come.” But so far there
has been no report that Patrick White,
Morris West, or John O’Grady has
been short-listed though all of them,
when in the mood, can write prose of
fire.

How about a VIP
flight from Vietnam?
BY
“OBSERVER”
NOW WE KNOW what sort of salads
and sausage rolls they serve on VIP
aircraft, we might as well know what
the aircraft themselves are like. It looks
as if most of the new aircraft the Gov-
ernment is buying are the wrong air-
craft.
Why, for instance, do we have to
buy two of the big BAC-llls? There
could be just possibly enough work for
one of these aircraft if we were happy
for it to run two-thirds empty most of
the time. But why two? Probably one
is intended purely as a back-up, in case
something goes wrong on important
occasions. But is such a luxury worth
the extra money? Even more import-
ant, why buy the BAC-111 at all? These
BAC-llls of the RAAF will be entirely
alone in this part of the world. There
will be no military or civil pool of spare
parts for them. This will make them
more costly to run and it also means
that if they have to be used by the
RAAF for some serious purpose it will
be virtually impossible to integrate
these two completely alien aircraft and
their engines into any transport
squadron.
If we must have a 70-seat jet VIP
aircraft, why should it not be fitted out
as a quick-change VIP/ambulance air-
craft? One of its main uses could be
in transporting sick and wounded from
South Vietnam. In fact, the U.S. Air
Force recently ordered just such a ver-
sion of the DC9 after lengthy considera-
tion of competing “air-ambulance”
BAC-llls and Boeing 7375. If we had
to have two such aircraft, why not two
DC9-30s equipped for medical evacu-
ation work when not needed for the
VIPs, which should be most of the
time? The RAAF would then have the
benefit of the local airlines’ spare parts
pools and it would also be able to inte-
grate the aircraft with the airlines’
DC9s if an emergency made this neces-
sary.
One can also ask why we are going
to hang on to the two Viscount 816
type aircraft. This appears another ex-
pensive and senseless luxury. The local
airline services have slated these aircraft
for early retirement and once the civil
planes have gone the continued opera-
tion of the two Viscount 816 s by the
RAAF will become costly, because there
will be no pool service for them. The
type of capacity provided by these air-
craft is almost exactly duplicated and
superseded by either the BAC-111 or the
DC9. Like the Convair Metropolitans,
the two Viscounts should be disposed
of immediately while it is still possible
to get a decent price for them.
The HS74B seems to be the only
wise choice the Government has made
for its VIP work. This aircraft is more
flexible than the airline-operated
Friendships in airport needs and it can
be easily integrated with the other
RAAF 748 s now on order for use as
navigation trainers, should the need
arise. And any job which can be done
by the Viscount can be done almost as
well by the HS74B and more
cheaply.
At the lower end of the scale there
is the Mystere 20. On the face of it
this is a good choice. This small jet
is ideal for conveying small parties
very quickly. As an executive jet it
could supply the main need. Yet for
some strange lack of reason the RAAF
version is equipped with the standard
model very-high-pressure tyres and its
use therefore restricted to only a few
airports. The privately owned Business
Jet Mystere, however, is fitted with
special low-pressure tyres which enable
it to operate into virtually any DC3
standard strips. Why is the VIP Mystere
not similarly fitted? It will not be
surprising if the VIP Mysteres are
later sent back to France for modifi-
cations to “low-pressure tyre” stan-
dard, so that they can be used as they
should be, as an aircraft that can fly
anywhere.
Considering the real needs of a VIP
aircraft fleet, we need only two types
of aircraft. To transport the occasional
large party the two HS74Bs suffice.
(This type of aircraft has recently en-
tered service with the Queen’s Flight,
RAF, in England.) The bulk of the
need is for a small fast jet to carry up
to five or six people to any town in
Australia, large or small. The Mystere
20, if fitted with versatile low-pressure
tyres, would fill this need perfectly.
Four or five would be enough.
If we must press on with a big jet,
and the BAC-111 at that, why not fit
the aircraft for ambulance work? The
specifications for this job already exist,
having been drawn up to the U.S. Air
Force requirement. It would be easy
to design a quick-change version. In
fact, the whole Government should, per-
haps, get into something more of a
mood for quick changing.
Holt should find the
time to do nothing
BY
ALAN
REID
IF THE VIP aircraft affair did nothing
else it should be a warning to the Holt
Government to tighten up on its politi-
cal thinking. The Government took an
awful pasting on this subject, and
because its handling of the issue was so
sloppy it deserved what it got.
It is becoming clearer that while on
the policy and administrative side the
Holt Government is prepared to make
courageous and clearcut decisions and
to hold to them firmly, on the political
side it has grave weaknesses.
Nobody seems to think further ahead
than 24 hours. There is no political
preparation or planning. Politically, the
Government seems to prefer to work off
the seat of its pants rather than through
its head.
Take the handling of the final stages
of the VIP affair. It might not have
been important at the start. But the
way it had been allowed to develop it
had clearly grown important. Nothing
was more certain that unless it was
handled very shrewdly it would be used
by Labor to attack the Government’s
credibility at the forthcoming Senate
elections (Opposition Leader Gough
Whitlam has since done precisely this
in his opening speech for the Senate
campaign).
The Government had timetable prob-
lems. Air Minister Peter Howson was in
Uganda when passenger manifests
which he had wrongly told the Parlia-
ment did not exist were tabled in the
Parliament by Senate Government
Leader John Gorton. But he was back
in_time for Holt to see him on Monday
of last week for his explanation.
It was at this stage that in my view
the incredible happened. Holt decided
to refer the question of Howson’s future
(Howson had offered Holt his resigna-
tion) to Cabinet. This was fair enough.
But with Parliament scheduled to meet
at 2.30 p.m. on the Wednesday, Holt
decided to hold his Cabinet meeting
not on Tuesday (Melbourne Cup Day)
but on Wednesday morning.
This left Cabinet with a couple
of hours to decide what it should do
about Howson’s proffered resignation,
to check through Howson’s account of
how he came to mislead the Parliament
on the passenger manifests, and to con-
sider the statements that Holt and How-
son should make to the Parliament. On
that timetable it was inevitable that the
outcome would be as messy as a dog’s
breakfast.
There were gaps in Howson’s state-
ment that Whitlam was able to drive
his horse and cart through mercilessly.


So did others including Mr. Clyde
Cameron (Lab., S.A.), Mr. Fred Daly
(Lab., N.S.W.), and Dr. Jim Cairns
(Lab., Vic.).
The Sydney “Daily Telegraph”
summed up a basic flaw in the expla-
nation when it described as “extra-
ordinary” the inference contained in
Howson’s statement “that senior mem-
bers of his (Howson’s) department must
have known or should have known for
a year or more that the replies which
the Government was giving in Parlia-
ment on the question of VIP planes
were not strictly accurate.”
Lack of preparation marked Holt’s
speech. In defence of Howson and
Cabinet’s decision to retain Howson on
the Ministry, Holt meandered on ex-
tensively about Howson having been
honored by the Commonwealth Parlia-
mentary Association while in Uganda.
If this had any relevance to the subject
under debate the relevance seemed to
escape his parliamentary listeners. It
certainly escaped me. If it was intended
as a red herring (as later Labor speak-
ers alleged) its characteristics were
more fatuous than fishy.
Part of the weakness in the Govern-
ment’s capacity for political thinking
revealed by the Howson business is due
to the personality of Holt. A man of
indefatigable energy, always on the
move, Holt is eternally busy. He is
quite accurate when he says that he
works 16 hours a day and drives him-
self mercilessly. But this can be as
much a weakness as a strength. A
Prime Minister needs time off not to
loaf but to think.
However busy he was (and I con-
cede that Prime Ministers are very busy
men with fantastic demands upon their
time), Menzies always took an Four off
each day just to do his political think-
ing. The late Ben Chifley, as Prime
Minister, was equally busy but he took
an hour off either for a solitary walk
round Parliament House gardens or for
a camp on his sofa so that he could
think through his political problems.
The late Jack Curtin, when Prime
Minister, always put in an hour a day,
cigarette-holder jutting up at the ceil-
ing as he rested on the broad of his
back, just thinking.
All three Prime Ministers got into
political trouble. No Prime Minister
can escape it. It is the price of office.
But they seldom got into needless politi-
cal trouble because they consciously
and with thought attempted to avoid
the needless.
The Government may continue with
its sloppy political performance. It may
get away with it. Policies may be viewed
by the voters as more important than
the obvious shortcomings that flow from
an almost casual approach to political
problems.
But, as I see it, even if the Govern-
ment’s complacency turns out to be
justified, it is taking a needless risk, and
needless risks have a habit of turning
out to be dangerous risks in politics.
Ansett adrift: can Susan
Jones help?
BY
MICHAEL
BAUME
TELEVISION IS NOT the only prob-
lem worrying Mr. Reginald Myles
Ansett, chairman and managing direc-
tor of Ansett Transport Industries.
Right now his airline seems to be
creating even more problems than his
television stations, which continued
their losing way last year, bringing his
Austarama Channel 0 losses to $2.3
million, along with $433,359 write-off
for his $930,000 shareholdings in Uni-
versal Telecasters Queensland, the
associate company that has lost sub-
stantially more than its $1 million paid
capital and in which the Ansett group
has $3 million at risk.
For Ansett is losing out to TAA
and badly. On the facts emerging from
last week’s Ansett balance sheet for
1966-67, TAA did better on almost
every score. TAA won far more new
passengers; TAA’s revenue rose much
faster; its air freight rose, while Ansett’s
fell; and in the key indicator of air-
line success, the revenue load factor,
TAA’s appears to have held up much
better than Ansett-ANA’s, which fell for
the second year in a row. So Ansett’s
profits dropped by $675,000, or 17 per-
cent and had it not been for a change
in accounting methods it seems they
could have fallen by at least a further
$250,000, and possibly a lot more, leav-
ing very little cover indeed for the
10 percent dividend. TAA’s profits also
fell, but only by a tiny $9OOO.
Why did things suddenly go so bad?
Ansett complains of a “cost explosion”
sparked off by pilots’ demands. And
there is no doubt that average wages
the group paid last year were 13 per-
cent higher than the year before, which
is a serious blow. But fares have risen
twice, once by three percent in Sep-
tember last year and by five percent
three months ago (which ought to help
Ansett’s results for the current 12
months). And Ansett says that higher
costs (and “ever increasing aviation
taxation”) are making many feeder
routes uneconomic. In addition, he now
faces competition from the small charter
airlines that recently won approval to
operate in Australia. But the crucial
point appears to be Ansett-ANA’s failure
to do as well in selling airline tickets as
TAA. This could bring serious prob-
lems to the Government; to maintain
a two-airline system in which the pri-
vate enterprise line falls behind the per-
formance of the State-owned one prob-
ably requires the Government to keep
giving the private operator more and
more of the cake by taking things away
from TAA—and that is what has hap-
pened in recent years. Naturally the
Ansett Viscount crash at Winton did
not help its sales effort, but that could
not have accounted for all of TAA’s
improvement at Ansett’s expense. What
is wrong? Can Susan Jones help?
Ansett needs a success from Susan
Jones. The facts of Ansett’s flagging
effort in the 12 months to July this
year can be seen from a rise of only
half of one percent in its passengers
carried, while TAA increased its pas-
sengers by 10 percent in roughly the
same period. True, Ansett-ANA still
carries more passengers, 2,455,447
against TAA’s two million, but it has
more routes available to it. These are
not always a help financially, for many
of the Ansett country routes have low
revenue load factors and tend to pull
Ansett’s average down.
The serious consequences of Ansett’s
fall in revenue load factors is evident
from the fact that had the company
been able to keep up the 64J percent
load factor of three years ago, instead
of last year’s 62.2 percent (the worst
level for seven years), it would have
earned another s3| million in revenue.
Judging by the rates of tax that the
group pays (only $214,039 tax on pro-
fits of about $3.3 million), this would
have just about doubled Ansett’s profits
for the year. It is true that the influx of
big, new, fast aircraft has been an influ-
ence in reducing load factors, as de-
mand has not yet caught up with the
added supply of seats, but Ansett’s loss
of customers to TAA is also crucial.
Ansett has spent a lot of money
on these new aircraft; his fleet cost
$93 million, a rise of $l7 million last
year. But despite all the spending,
the number of aircraft seats in his
airliners has risen by only 45 to 3249,
as the company has been selling off
many of its older aircraft; for the thing
about the new jets is that the same
seat moves everywhere so much quicker
that it can be used far more frequently
than those in the Electras, Viscounts,
and DC6Bs that were formerly on these
routes. All this spending on new air-
craft explains why airline activities are
making up a greater proportion of
Ansett’s assets nowadays; instead of last
year’s 62 percent, airline operations use
68 percent of the group’s assets (and
provide 66 percent of its revenue).
But all these airline and television
problems must be making Reg Ansett
wonder why he expanded out of his
old business of road transport. For
his latest accounts reveal the irony that
his road passenger and road freight
businesses earn revenue at about double
the rate on assets employed that his
airline does —and his television opera-
tions are yet to earn anything at all.
If only these road activities made up
more than 6 percent of his assets (they
provide 13-| percent of his revenue) his
company would look a lot healthier.

AUSTRALIA
The VIP affair —an example
of government by officials
THIS IS WHAT actually happened
behind the scenes in the VIP affair:
A question asked by Senator Gair in
the Senate in late 1965 and directed to
the Minister for Air was left un-
answered because no one could think
of a satisfactory way to deal with it.
In March, 1966, in' the House of
Representatives, Mr. Daly asked a
•similar question of the Prime Minister.
Both questions were referred to the
Prime Minister’s Department, who in
turn made inquiries from the Air
Force. The Air Force turned up the
perfectly accurate answer that records
of passengers were kept principally so
that next-of-kin could be notified in
the case of a crash, but that they
(were not very accurate. On this basis
a senior public servant (not a politician)
decided it could be argued, without
much stretching of the truth, that the
information was not available.
He made a plain stupid mistake in
going on to say that there was no
record of where VIP planes had flown,
since not only Air Force but Civil
Aviation regulations require the keep-
ing of a flight authorisation book. The
Air Department did not like the
answers, but the affair was out of its
hands. When the issue became hot, the
Department sent a memo, but the memo
was filed away without being seen by
the Prime Minister or the Air Minister.
The VIP flight was run pretty
directly from the Air Minister’s office
—when Ministers want a plane they
•send a secretary just around the corri-
dor to see the VIP Flight Squadron
Leader, who is desked in the Air
Minister’s suite, which is between those
of the Treasurer and the Prime
Minister. The politics of VIP flights
from April, 1966, onwards were taken
over by the Prime Minister’s Depart-
ment. From the initial mistake of that
time, the answers to questions were a
simple matter of trying to maintain
consistency so that there would be no
more trouble.
Nor would there have been if the
DLP had not held the balance of power
in the Senate and if Senator Turnbull,
the Independent from Tasmania, had
not been looking for an issue to arouse
publicity. As soon as he became Leader
of the Government in the Senate,
Senator John Gorton began to worry
about whether there was a cover-up
that might be uncovered.
Faced with a motion to bring the
Secretary of the Air Department to
the Senate for questioning, Senator
Gorton took matters into his own hands.
He determined that the Secretary
would, if questioned, have to tell the
Senate that, in accordance with regu-
lations, records were in fact kept and
available. This would prove the Gov-
ernment liars in circumstances of high
drama. The only course of action was
for Senator Gorton to acquire the docu-
ments and table them and let the Gov-
ernment try to make the best of a bad
situation. It could at least attempt to
claim that the affair was an honest
mistake and make the point that it
had after all produced the documents.
Since the critical answers to ques-
tions in May, 1966, were drafted by
officials in the Prime Minister’s De-
partment and since further questions
simply followed this pattern, the Air
Minister’s African safari and his
dramatic return were an irrelevant
diversion. However, it was absurd for
him to claim that it was all the fault
of his personal staff.
His political opponents knew that
answers to parliamentary questions are
generally drafted in a Department, not
by a Minister’s staff. At the very least,
draft copies are sent over to the Depart-
ment for comment. And if it should
happen that a Minister fails to follow
these procedures, his Department is
inform him if he is making
an important mistake of fact, especi-
ally on such hot political issues as the
VIP Flight. Hansard is required bed-
time reading for all aspiring senior
public servants, and the Air Depart-
ment, operating under specific regu-
lations about keeping records, must
have made sure that the Government
realised what it was doing.
Why did the Government flounder
so badly in the sheer politics of the
affair? Principally because of the lack
of politically minded Ministers in
Cabinet. Far too many Ministers, in-
cluding the Prime Minister, are leaving
themselves in the hands of Government
officials on political matters.
Country Party Leader McEwen has
a first-class political mind, but there is
no evidence at the moment that Holt
and McEwen work as a team, though
united in the bonds of the Liberal-
Country Party coalition. McEwen’s
Air Minister Howson. .. getting the drum in Nairobi


political ability seems wasted these days
and limited to operating only within a
Country Party rather than a Govern-
ment context.
Gorton has a political sense. He
showed this when he inisisted on tabling
the VIP manifests as soon as he knew
they were in existence, thereby appeas-
ing Gair, McManus, and (in part)
Turnbull. The Government would have
been in a far worse mess if the docu-
ments had come through a, Senate in-
quiry forced upon the Government
rather than voluntarily.
Treasurer McMahon has political
shrewdness, despite having involved
himself recently in political difficulties.
But (and this could be the product of
the personality clash between him and
McEwen) his objectivity is not com-
pletely trusted. Instead of listening to
what he has to say on a political sub-
ject, there is a tendency on the part of
his colleagues to ask, “Why is he saying
this?”
Interestingly, External Affairs Minis-
ter Paul Hasluck, who was regarded at
one stage as almost unpolitical, has
shown recent flashes of political aware-
ness. It is as though he has become
aware of the political weaknesses in the
Government and is trying to make his
own thinking more consciously political.
This is an alarming measure of the
Government’s political failings.
The election
A DLP Senate?
UNLESS THERE IS some really spec-
tacular turn of events the DLP is going
to win the Senate elections. For unless
either the Government parties or the
ALP are able to gain three Senators in
five out of six States, they will both
be in a minority. The luck of the draw
for ballot positions is against this re-
sult, and more importantly there is
no evidence of a strong swing of pub-
lic opinion to either the Government
or the Labor Party to give them the
vote needed. Both go into this election
with 14 seats, and therefore require an
extra 17 for control of the chamber of
60. An aspirant to control can there-
fore afford to be beaten in only one
State (nothing less than 5 by 3 plus a
2 equals 17).
Not only is the DLP likely to main-
tain control through its balance of
power position over the two minority
Parties. It is likely to gain an addition
to its strength. It is almost certain to
pick up one extra Senator somewhere,
and could end up with a four-man
team. A swing away from Labor could
give it the preferences to have George
Cole elected in Tasmania over Inde-
pendent “Spot” Turnbull. More likely
is a swing away from the Government,
in which case DLP candidates in Vic-
Senator Gair (front) and McManus
toria, Queensland, and Western Austra-
lia could be elected. The favorite for
election is Mr. Condon Byrnes in
Queensland. He is well known in the
State, having appeared frequently on
television in discussion programs and
interviews, and he has the support of
many normally Liberal voters.
Less likely but quite possible is the
election of Jack Little in Victoria, where
the basic DLP vote is largest and the
Party organisation strongest. Theoretic-
ally a DLP Senator could be elected in
Western Australia, if there is, say, a
5 percent swing away from the Govern-
ment. Only a small increase in DLP
support would then be needed, but there
is no evidence this will be forthcom-
ing.
Mr. Holt is going to find it very
hard going arguing for Government
control of the Senate now that, in
recent months, it has for once acted as
a chamber of review. Its delaying of
increased postal charges got tremendous
publicity and it was the Senate’s
strength against the Government that
pushed Parliament toward the truth on
the VIP aircraft affair.
The Government argues that it needs
control of the Upper House so that its
essential business can be carried
through, but it has managed to get all
its Bills through despite its minority in
the Senate this year. In any case, the
ALP and the DLP are unlikely to want
a showdown with the Government
simultaneously.
The DLP slogan is going to be that
while a Government-controlled Senate
would be a lapdog Senate, and an ALP
majority would produce a wild-dog
Senate, only a Senate in which the DLP
holds the balance of power would be
a true watchdog Senate.
Shipping
Burns Philp's
burning problem
EVEN WITH A $400,000-a-year Com-
monwealth subsidy, Burns Philp’s three
Australian-manned island trading ships
have been doing badly; without it they
have no chance. So, after last month’s
decision by the Federal Government to
end the subsidy next year, Burns Philp
has been thinking about registering
its ships at non-Australian ports and
replacing its Australian crews with
cheaper foreign labor. Naturally
enough, the Seamen’s Union is not
pleased, claiming that 300 Australian
seamen would lose their jobs. The issue
is now building itself up into what
could be a serious dispute.
The subsidy, paid since 1955 to keep
the company in the trade, has, in effect,
made up the difference between the
costs of running BP’s Australian-
registered, Australian-crewed ships and
those of competitors using cheap-labor
crews; its stated intention was to keep
a regular, reliable shipping service to
the area.
But now there are 13 operators serv-
ing Papua-New Guinea ports (although
all but three or four just drop in on
the way somewhere else), and the Com-
monwealth’s Shipping and Transport
Minister, Gordon Freeth, said there
was little likelihood of shipping services
being diminished by the subsidy’s with-
drawal.
For if Burns Philp left the area, it
might even result in an improvement
in the shipping service as rival operators
put newer, specially designed ships on
the run. Already one rival, the China
Navigation Co. (an associate of the
local Swire and Yuill group) has intro-
duced a revolutionary new ship, the
3200-ton Papuan Chief, that knocks
the pants off the old-style conventional
ships run by Burns Philp the 28-
year-old 6400-ton Bulolo, the 15-year-
old 3800-ton Maleluka, and the two-
year-old 3200-ton Moresby.
China Navigation have been consider-
ing putting more ships like the Papuan
Chief on the run, and the end of Burns
Philp’s subsidy (along with its monopoly
right to carry copra and Government
stores) may prompt an early decision
to do so.. For the Papuan Chief, with its
fold-out sides and deck which allow
for speedy, horizontal loading by fork-
lift trucks instead of gangs of wharfies,
can make profits on this run without
the aid of subsidy and could pro-
bably do so even if it had an Australian
rather than its Papuan crew.
Apart from their old-style cargo-
handling limitations, the Burns Philp
ships, with their large passenger accom-
modation, are becoming less appropri-
ate; the first-class air fare to Port
Moresby is less than the sea fare.
So the withdrawal of the subsidy


(recommended some time ago in the
World Bank’s report on Papua and
New Guinea) seems aimed at encourag-
ing the introduction of new, more
efficient ships (which could even bring
freight reductions) and there is every
chance that Burns Philp itself may
follow the lead set by China Naviga-
tion by selling off the Bulolo and buy-
ing something like the Papuan Chief.
But whether or not such modern ships
can pay their way when manned by
Australian crews against cheap-crew
competition is yet to be seen; it would
be remarkable if the Government, by
ending the subsidy, ended up knocking
the only Australian-registered operator
out of the islands trade at the same
time as it was allowing the Australian
National Line to move into overseas
services.
Shipping opinion is that there is
little prospect of the ANL taking Burns
Philp’s place if BP did pull out in-
stead of simply registering their ships
In a port of convenience and taking on
cheap crews, despite reports (uncon-
firmed by Burns Philp, which is not
talking to the Press at this stage) that
BP was quite willing to sell its fleet
to the ANL.
The RSL
Out of the
silence
THE CHANGING OF the guard in
the RSL was never a more public
spectacle than last week when the
League began distributing its half-
million pamphlets, “Honored in war
forgotten in peace.”
For the first time the League has
made a direct assault on the policies
of the Federal Government and the
report is echoing through every sub-
branch in Australia.
Until this year it has been the policy
of the RSL, as the nation’s most
prestigious interest group, to refrain
from public criticism of the program
and administration of the Common-
wealth, except in very marginal areas.
Former leaders such as Sir George Hol-
land believed the best way of gaining
advantage was to press claims privately
with the Federal Cabinet’s Ex-Service-
men’s Sub-Committee.
Cabinet, in turn, was happy to des-
cribe the RSL as the only pressure
group in the country which rated a
special committee of Cabinet to hear its
claims. The situation was a comfort-
able one for the Government since it
was protected from public attack. The
old guard of the RSL thought the price
of political silence well worth paying in
view of the dividends reaped by direct
access to Cabinet.
The new leaders such as national
president, Sir Arthur Lee, and national
secretary, Mr. W. G. Keys, believe that
the times of detente are well past and
the League should become more mili-
tant. Their pamphlet states th,e reason:
“When the Government came into
power in 1950 it carried out a promise
to restore the pension for totally and
permanently incapacitated (TPI) ex-
servicemen to 101 percent of the then
basic wage. It fixed other war pension
rates for partial incapacity at 51 percent
of the basic wage.
“In the 17 years it has been in office,
the Government has allowed war pen-
sions to deteriorate so that now the
TPI war pension is only 81 percent of
the minimum wage and the highest
rate of partial disablement 32 percent
of this wage.” The pamphlet added:
“The Commonwealth Government’s
neglect of war pensions for incapaci-
tated veterans must be resisted,” and
declared that the present state of pen-
sions “is unacceptable to all fair-
minded Australians.”
Sir Arthur Lee explained last week
that the League had tried to get im-
provements in pensions through its
annual presentation of a pensions plan
to the Ex-Servicemen’s Committee of
Cabinet, but “this has produced little
improvement in pension rates and
finally this year values reached their
lowest level on record.”
The Government was warned of im-
pending political action by the RSL
when the League’s last national congress
agreed that public protests would have
to be made over benefits for ex-service-
men even if these protests had party-
political implications. The issuing
of a pamphlet hostile to the Govern-
ment so close to the Senate election
indicates the strength of RSL feeling.
For the Government and the Liberal
Party the message is clear. The RSL
is no longer under bond. Mr. Whitlam
will have noticed, too.
National communities
Greek v. Greek
THE TROUBLE FOR the Committee
for the Restoration of Democracy in
Greece began when its secretary, Mr.
Victor Nollis, wrote intemperately to
the Minister for Immigration explaining
that the aim of the Greek Centre Union
Party was to “overthrow the puppet dic-
tators of Greece.”
Mr. Nollis was trying to get a visa
for Dr. Nikolaides, who belongs to
the Centre Union Party, so that he
could address Greek rallies throughout
Australia and also last Sunday’s Vic-
torian Labor Party Vietnam mobilisa-
tion meeting. But Mr. Snedden and his
Department are not pleased at the pros-
pect of migrant communities continu-
ing with their old political divisions and
the description of the Centre Party in
revolutionary terms gave them an
excuse for keeping Dr. Nikolaides out.
The talk about not wishing to offend
leaders of a friendly nation may be
dismissed as diplomatic padding
such considerations did not count with
the U.S.A., Britain, Canada, Sweden,
Denmark, and France when Dr. Niko-
laides obtained their visas and Mr.
Snedden displayed his motives when he
said: “The Government has also been
concerned to avoid the stirring of dis-
sension among the Greek settler com-
munities in Australia by external in-
fluences to which such a visit may
contribute.”
Mr. Snedden did not say, though he
might have, that some Greek extremists
have already set up machinery for an
Australian arm of a Greek Liberation
Front which is Communist sponsored
and financed, and hopes to supply
volunteers for an armed bid to end the
rule of the present military junta in
Greece.
After the political attacks that fol-
lowed the announcement of the ban on
Dr: Nikolaides, there was consolation
for Mr. Snedden in the statement of
the 15 Melbourne Greek Orthodox
communities which pledged their sup-
port for the decision of the Australian
Government. The communities in-
Opposing views on Dr. Nikolaides in
Melbourne’s Greek newspapers
elude those of Carlton, North Carlton,
and Richmond, where the Greek popu-
lation is at its heaviest.
The latest issue of the Greek news-
paper the “Torch” is even more forth-
right. The paper congratulates the
Government for its “wise decision” and
claims that Dr. Nikolaides is “not a
responsible person on the Greek situ-
ation” and never held an important
public position in Greece. (Nikolaides
supporters claim that he was secre-
tary of the former Prime Minister, Mr.
George Papandreou.)
“Torch” states that Nikolaides is a
convicted embezzler released from jail
by amnesty, a pro-Communist, and an
opportunist who is touring the world
at the expense of misguided Greek
organisations. The editor of the paper,
Mr. Michael Michaelides, told The
Bulletin last week that this informa-
tion had been supplied to him by
his Greek correspondent.
Mr. Nollis, of the Committee for the
Restoration of Democracy in Greece,
denied these charges and also said that


his letter to Mr. Snedden had been
misinterpreted. “How could we over-
throw a Government” he asked. “As a
committee we are powerless, so we are
trying to arouse public opinion that
will cause the Australian and other
Governments to put pressure on the
military junta ruling our country.” But
so far Mr. Nollis and his 'committee
are finding it difficult to arouse
majority opinion amongst Greeks, a
large number of whom seem to regard
only one thing as being worse than
military rule, and that appears to be
xule by politicians.
Civil liberties
Queensland's fight
to the finish
AS THE GATES of Brisbane’s Boggo
Road Jail closed behind two Queens-
land University staff members last
week, State Parliament was listening
to some earnest justification of amend-
ments to Traffic and Main Roads Acts.
Both events were connected with
what happened on September 8 the
day on which police and civil liberties
demonstrators clashed with rather more
than a resounding tinkle in central
Brisbane streets.
English tutor Dan O’Neill, 29, an
Oxford graduate, and philosophy lec-
turer Peter Wertheim, 38, were among
the ten staff members arrested on
September 8. Their cases were heard
in the Brisbane Magistrates Court last
week. Each refused to pay the $lO
fines imposed, and both were carted
off to jail to serve the three-day de-
fault sentence.
At the time, State Main Roads
Minister Camm was busily addressing
the House on the amendments he had
tabled. “Clouds of distortion and un-
truth have been raised on civil liberties
issues at the Queensland University by
a very small but very vocal group of
junior lecturers and senior students,”
he said.
But the amendments he tabled were
'certainly not going to make that “small
group” any less vocal. They reduced
the period for which an application
for a demonstration permit had to be
lodged from 14 to seven days. They
also removed the need for a permit
to carry a placard and the charge
of $1 a sign for doing so.
But the two central issues contested
By the varsity campaigners the
fact that final approval of a demonstra-
tion permit is in the hands of a police
•officer and the need for redefinition
of footpath and carriageway in the
legislation were ignored.
Mr. Camm told the House that pro-
posals made “by some groups” to allow
meetings and processions on footpaths
without any permits or notice “were
the real ambition of the Left-wing
malcontents behind these troubles.”
By the end of the week, the cam-
paign leaders were unhappy but un-
daunted. O’Neill and Wertheim were
out of jail O’Neill with a'brand new
campaign in support of Republicans
who might receive jail sentences.
He had refused to salute prison
officers at a prison parade, and for his
trouble he spent 24 hours of his sentence
locked in his cell from which the fur-
niture or all but a lavatory bucket
and a floor mat had been removed.
(An article in the State Prisons Act
states that prisoners on muster or
parade will salute in military fashion
as a mark of respect to authority of
the Sovereign.)
He was also put on half rations as
extra punishment. “I called for a bible
and got through half the book of
Genesis. So things weren’t really too
bad,” he said.
Civil Liberties Co-ordinating Com-
mittee spokesman Brian Laver had, as
usual, plenty to say. He was not satis-
fied with the Government amendments
and is one of the organisers of the com-
mittee’s State-wide public information
campaign planned for the Christmas
vacation.
“We have already recruited 100
students to tour the State with in-
formation on the issue, whose job it
will be to let everybody know just
what is going on. The university Union
has sponsored our entire campaign,
which will continue to the start of
first term next year.
“The Trades and Labor Council are
jointly sponsoring the production of a
pamphlet with us. We are having
50,000 copies printed and these will be
circulated throughout the country. We
have also had offers of financial assist-
ance from interstate, and are . hoping
for help from several sources. We hope
to have talks with the Government in
the new year, and if we don’t get what
we want then there will hav* 1 to be
another major march.”
Another march will probably mean
another brawl. Another brawl will cer-
tainly mean more jail sentences. And
if enough people can only manage to
stay out of jail the battle fop
Queensland’s civil liberties might one
day be fought to the finish . . .
O’Neill... three days’ jail
The West
Tom the Mayor
THE ELECTION OF Mr. Tom (The
Cheap Grocer) Wardle as Lord Mayor
of Perth will mean considerably more
than just a new man in a figurehead
post. First, the election has already
brought on quite a remarkable trans-
formation in this remarkable man.
Second, even the election of his rival,
Sir Frank Ledger, would have been
significant. Both stood on the same
platform sounder leadership, better
communications, and tighter organisa-
tion. Because Wardle has beaten an
Establishment machine the message will
echo throughout local government in
the West, perhaps throughout Australia.
The change in Tom Wardle is a dif-
ferent matter. Before his mandate he
was not as sure of himself as might
have been expected for a man in his
position. There was an impression,
quite wrongly, that he had taken on the
world, and not only manufacturers and
opposition, when he started building his
165-store chain of grocery and discount
houses. Close friends have noticed, since
his election as “the man of the people,”
that, his attitudes have changed, his
handshake has firmed. Those in the
television audience who watched him
through his $lO,OOO election campaign
could see night by night the shyness
that has characterised Tom Wardle
being shed.
The result will be a new broom in
every sense of the word in an insti-
tution ripe for reform. Lord Mayor
Wardle plans to dissolve “any power
groups that might exist in Perth City
Council.” He had expressed himself
willing to sacrifice his close personal
touch in his pyramidal business to be-
come involved in Council affairs. “A
presiding officer is useless,” he says. “I
want to know the reasons for com-
mittee decisions, not just the decisions.”
Two of the hotter issues he will
soon face are that of dismissed Town
Planner Paul Ritter and that of a
concert hall for Perth. Wardle has been
identified with a group pressing for
Ritter (who has issued a writ for
wrongful dismissal against the Council)
to get right of appeal, as well as the
group seeking a concert hall to replace
the Capitol Theatre.
While he has spoken quietly, Tom
Wardle has proved with his remorse-
less fight against orderly marketers that
he is not speaking idly in taking on
the power groups. The new Lord
Mayor’s attitude toward restrictive
big business and secrecy would promise
a showdown or two, were it not for
the Council general election coming up
in May. Even the most solidly en-
trenched Councillors must realise now
that with the new enthusiasm for local
government the past election has
brought there can be no return to the
bad old days of lobbies, closed doors,
and faits accompli.

What is the
nurse’s future?
By APRIL HERSEY
“WHEN YOU CONSIDER what a
nurse is and get her in the right
perspective, you realise she is being paid
reasonably well for what she offers. She
is not much more than a messenger
girl and she is far from being the cream
of the crop of messenger girls. A bright
girl school-leaver goes to the Univer-
sity, to teaching college or a higher
technical college to learn art or some
other skill; she turns to accountancy or
becomes a highly paid private secretary
before she looks at nursing. Nurses are
■one step ahead of waitresses today.
They have just that edge on the shop
assistant or unskilled factory worker.
“All this talk of professionalism is so
much nonsense. It may have been true
of nurses 20 years ago when few other
jobs were open, but we do not get a
high standard of nurses today. In the
hospital they work hard, but the work
is mainly repetitive and not far re-
moved from what the wardsmaid does.
Those who do have intelligence try to
understand the medical side, which is
advancing faster than doctors can
absorb it, so what chance has a girl
who probably came in the lower half
of her class throughout her schooling.
Her job is really to bath the patients
and hand out the pills. A nurse’s aide
could do it.”
These are the views of a general
practitioner with a large city practice,
whose patients are frequently in and out
of one of the largest hospitals in
Sydney.
They may sound harsh. They are
certainly controversial, but they do
underline that the problems facing
nurses now are not only what is in
their pay-packets or how they are
trained. It seems that the profession
must either go up or down in standing,
and both sides can bring strong argu-
ments for their case.
The standing of nursing exercises the
minds of those who trained in a dedi-
cated manner in the past.
“We need to recruit applicants who
have been successful at the sixth-year
standard school certificate,” a senior
sister, who for the first time had to
accept a nursing aide as part of her
skilled team, said with a firmness that
might not have been there a few years
ago. “And we need to offer the candi-
date more interesting work. The medi-
cal staff must accept the nurse as an
intelligent co-worker whether or not she
has a university degree. Because the
pharmacist, the physiotherapist, the
social worker, and future hospital
administrators are university qualified,
there is a tendency to treat the nurse
as unintelligent and overlook her func-
tion. She is still the lifeblood of a
hospital.”
Matron Pat Jenkins, of Liverpool
District Hospital, who is matron dele-
gate to the N.S.W. Nurses’ Association
as well as being a member of the
council of the College of Nursing, has
her own strong theories on why there
is wastage in the nursing profession. In
her opinion the four-year course is so
stereotyped and boring that any intel-
ligent girl can very early sum up the
situation. She realises there is little
to stimulate her interest in the job over
a lifetime and she drops out.
“I believe we must concentrate on
improving the status by improving the
entrance standard. I think sisters in
hospital should really be professional.
In the past our programs have been
geared to absorb the less qualified
person. Get a girl interested and she
can cover nursing in a two-year basic
course. An intelligent girl should be
able to learn to report. Three-quarters
of nursing is observation and the rest
is communication. The most techni-
cally qualified nurse is useless to
medicine if she doesn’t know how to
look and how to report back. I think
a. girl could be trained well in two
years. In the past so much of the
course has been repetitive. It is often
difficult and beyond a girl’s easy under-
standing and she is pushed to the limits
of her ability. What you get at the
end of a training period is all you will
ever get. There is no incentive to go
on learning, to improve and expand
knowledge. The trained nurse is fre-
quently plodding on doing the same
things she learnt to do ten or twenty
years ago.”
Miss Jenkins feels that at the present
time only four girls in every hundred
emerge from their training with any
idea of the profession of nursing. The
percentage should be at least twenty
to thirty in every hundred. When she
Sydney nurses
in a new role
as militant
unionists
asked members of a recent graduate
class: “What are you going to do for
your profession?” she was shocked when
three out of ten answered, “Come to
work!”
“I think very often the wrong
people are trained at a professional
level. It just doesn’t take. Not only
is the course of study beyond them but
they never have any idea of what nurs-
ing is all about.”
Sadly enough others come through
the course with flying colors but learn
along the way that there is little scope
for a bright mind. They pick up their
certificates but are soon lost to the
profession. One girl, who topped the
year at a famous teaching hospital,
accepted her certificate and as she filed
it away commented, “Whatever I do
from now on it will never be nursing.”
The gregarious life of the nurse, a
little like the Army, with all decisions
coming from above, everyone dressed
alike, and the bogy of loneliness dis-
pelled by the cheerful give and take
of the nurses’ home, is the strongest
card the profession has to play.
“It may be a fun life for some,”
one doctor commented. “But it isn’t
a healthy one. A completely female
society is never healthy. Lesbianism
is as rife in the hospitals as it is in
the Army or anywhere else where
women seek the company of other
women. And the military discipline
handed down by some frustrated
middle-aged spinsters who frequently
hold a dictatorship over hospitals has
caused plenty of nervous breakdowns.
I sometimes think it is bad that the
nursing system runs parallel with but
is not integrated with the medical
team of a hospital. The medical
superintendent can only suggest to a
matron what he thinks should be done


in a certain case, for, say, hospital
morale. He can’t enforce it.”
Nurses’ aides combined with very
highly trained and multiple-certificated
nurses are one solution being put for-
ward in nursing. “But here again,” one
matron commented, “you have to find
a sister who is prepared to do all the
work in the ward. There are not too
many who would take it on. It would
involve tremendous personal respon-
sibility. This system may eventuate in
Canada during the next few years.”
Registered nurses are taking a much
more realistic view of the responsi-
bility required of sisters and are con-
scious that often respect and status are
based on the pay-packet.
Many feel that postgraduate courses
attempted should ensure them addi-
tional salary. New knowledge of
equipment and drugs is expected of
them each day, and the use of different
facilities acquired by hospitals must be
picked up almost immediately and put
into use by nurses who are frequently
trying to follow the instructions on the
printed folder. Some incentive could
be provided for nurses who want to
broaden their general knowledge.
As it is, the usual confusion seems
to reign. As a sample of this strange
twilight world of thought governing
the nursing profession take the case
of the postgraduate course in Diseases
of the Chest. This was inaugurated
at Royal North Shore in 1951. St.
Vincent’s and Royal Prince Alfred fol-
lowed. Now only those nurses who
take this postgraduate course at Royal
Prince Alfred will benefit by an in-
crease in their pay, though the tutor
sisters giving the course at RPA were
originally trained at Royal North Shore.
The report of the committee set up
by the Institute of Hospital Matrons of
N.S.W. and A.C.T. to consider all
aspects of nursing was tabled at the
Institute’s annual conference in Sep-
tember.
In it the committee recommended 29
ways to improve the lot of nurses, the
most significant being the introduction
of a three-year course to replace the
four-year one now in general use in
N.S.W. and Queensland, though not in
other States. The committee suggested
that teaching and examination periods
be included in hospital time and not
in the nurses’ free time. Both ideas have
been accepted at least in spirit, and the
N.S.W. Minister for Health, Mr. Jago,
announced recently that they would be
implemented before the end of the
1968/9 financial year.
Optimists among the many associa-
tions concerned with nursing are sure
that this means July, 1968. It will be
left to the Nurses’ Registration Board
and the Hospitals Commission to work
out the details. And it will be left to
the already overtaxed hospitals to find
the extra staff they will require to
replace girls who are having their study
day. As they can’t find staff now this
is not going to be easy.
The acute shortage of nurses is
evident in almost every hospital. Even
the popular and geographically secure
Royal North Shore Hospital, which has
always been able to select its trainees
with scalpel-like precision, has now had
to drop the entrance age from 18 to
17f
At Royal Prince Alfred this month
a preliminary trainee school started
with 16 girls instead of the normal 80
or 90. Some of this is attributed to the
“off year” of the Wyndham scheme,
but there are estimated to be 500 nurses
needed desperately in the Sydney
metropolitan area.
Matron D. Dixon, of Manly District
Hospital, secretary of th'e Institute of
Hospital Matrons, and presiding over a
hospital beside the beach, which was
one of the most popular in the State,
now finds herself eagerly scanning the
mail for long envelopes which might
contain a completed form sent back by
a prospective trainee.
Most hospital matrons don’t any
longer pick and choose among possible
nurses. Though they know there will
be a wastage, they are so desperate for
hands and feet in the wards that anyone
warm and breathing is a possible choice.
A great number of young people
are attracted to nursing for reasons of
future security. It is a job that can be
picked up again at any time and in
any country in the world. Many nurses
now being welcomed back to full-time
duty in Australian hospitals are older
women who may have been partially
trained at some time and who find
they can pick up the course and go on
to graduation. Matrons take a sensible
attitude born out of the shortage. If the
older women have to return home to
attend to their families within reason-
able hours this is accepted.
Country girls are still proportionately
the largest group to enter nursing. They
are certainly not all Florence Night-
ingales. In the opinion of one doctor
the country group does not fit well
into nursing. “They are used to a rough
life in many cases. If they come from
farms or even big properties they have
already absorbed a tough attitude to-
ward living creatures which is not the
best thing to translate into ward life.
Nursing is always inclined to toughen
a girl more.”
Certainly a lot of the country brigade
are motivated more by a desire to
escape the country and the supervision
of parents than in nursing itself. They
hit the city with a determination to
enjoy every off-duty moment.
At the present time it is particu-
larly difficult to recruit new staff for
hospitals who urgently need young


trainees. One matron commented that
until some firm date for the commence-
ment of the new three-year training
scheme is given, with some idea of the
program of lectures, it is impossible
to advertise or to prepare brochures.
“We cannot tell girls when their train-
ing will finish or if there will be three
instead of the present two State Regi-
stration Examinations.”
It is over ten years since the pro-
fession first asked for a reduction of
training and over four years since the
first deputations were made to the
Government to reinforce the request,
but though the idea is far from new
not enough time may be left for ade-
quate planning.
“It seems as though it will be a little
scheme all over again,” one
harassed secretary, trying to phrase an
advertisement, said bitterly. “Several
thousand employees will be affected,
particularly those doing the General
(Professional Leadership) Course for
Registration as well as the Nursing Aide
course. In the United Kingdom, par-
ticularly England, hospitals can draw
student nurses from Europe, Africa,
and Ireland. We haven’t any of these
reserves of manpower. We can’t be left
with a great gap in the system which
we will still be trying to catch up in
ten years’ time. It’s the patient who will
suffer.”
So many different fields of medicine
are affected by any break in the train-
ing cf nurses in the big hospitals that
the secretary’s comment seems valid.
Nurses who will eventually finish up in
the Public Health Departments, the
Armed Services, District and Bush Nurs-
ing schemes, private nursing, private
hospitals, industrial and occupational
health, particularly in factories and in
many other equally important areas,
must receive their initial training in a
hospital.
In New South Wales, more than the
other States, the nursing profession is
very much in the melting pot, where a
rolling surge is evident in the not quite
boiling water. A number of intelligent
and very dedicated people are working
toward solutions, but the whole nursing
world is badly fragmented. Though
often the same people pop up on all
the committees, there is a tremendous
confusion of societies, and there appear
to be as many anomalies in the pro-
fession as a whole as there are reputed
to be in the new nurses’ award.
There is the N.S.W. Nurses’ Associa-
tion, headed by psychiatric nurse Mr.
A. L. Hart as general secretary, and
with Sister E. Thatcher, of Royal North
Shore Hospital, as president. This
organisation looks after the industrial
and economic welfare of nurses and is
supported by 13,000 nurses. It is an
industrial trade union which has just
been granted leave to appeal against
the award-handed down by Mr. Justice
Richards on July 13.
On the other hand there is the rather
ladylike Australasian Trained Nurses’
Association, with Miss Margaret Nelson,
Matron of Royal Prince Alfred Hospi-
tal, as president, which considers itself
the voice of professionalism in nursing
and has a membership including trainee
nurses of more than 5000. There is
also a College of Nursing for the post-
graduate nurse. The ATNA was the
original voice of nursing, battling away
back in 1901 to give those dedicated
souls in their high-button boots and
long dresses some sort of security. They
set the examinations, acted as the nurses’
registration board, and generally held
the fort in the infancy of trade
unionism. But the word union was not
one to soil the lips of nurses in those
far-off days and the ATNA was gradu-
ally ousted by the militant section of
the nursing community.
It became less important in 1927,
when the Nurses’ Registration Board as
we know it today was established as a
separate unit on which the ATNA was
not represented. It is still not repre-
sented. Though the board has seven
elected nurses, miscellaneous govern-
ment and university representatives, and
two trade unions, including one which
embraces hospital cleaners, the old-
established nursing association has been
given the cold shoulder for 30 years.
Every year they make application to
the Minister for Health for represen-
tation, and though Ministers have come
and gone during that time no one has
been clear-sighted enough to let this
large group of nurses back in. At least
the all-purpose quarter of a century
excuse has been that each Minister has
been unable to see his way clear.
Since the Nurses’ Registration Board
must combine with the Hospitals Com-
mission to work out details of the three-
year training course before it is ac-
cepted, it seems obvious that the ATNA
should be in there swinging.
In the Depression years the nursing
business hit an all-time low as far as
conditions for nurses were concerned
and they were ripe for union action.
After flirting with the thought of join-
ing the Hospital Employees’ Association
they convened a public meeting through
the Assistant Registrar of the Nurses’
Registration Board and overflowed the
top floor of Gowings Building in Syd-
ney, and in 1932 the N.S.W. Nurses’
Association was born. In 1945 they
amalgamated with the Trained Mental
Nurses’ Association.
The Institute of Hospital Matrons
was formed in 1946 with the intention
of working together for the mutual
benefit of nurses and to uphold the
status of the profession. President is
Matron G. Farthing, of Concord Repat-
riation Hospital, and the honorary sec-
retary is Matron D. Dixon, of Manly
District 1 fospital. With 220 members,
most of w hum are on other nursing
orientated committees, there is a great
volume of correspondence constantly
moving about in the upper echelons
of the hospitals. This group is quite
possibly the most influential in the
profession despite the noisy voice of the
union.
A little, embarrassed at the jumping-
up and down of the members of such a
previously decorous profession, the
N.S.W. Nurses’ Association does have
the blessing of all but the most diehard
of nurses, though there is still a large
group of nurses who do not believe in
trade unionism and who are not com-
pelled to join the union.
Miss B. Stanliand, assistant general
secretary for the past six years to the
asociation and herself a triple-certi-
ficated nurse (all salaried staff of the
union must be nurses), feels that every
effort was made to get better rates for
nurses through conciliation and arbitra-
tion before having to turn to militancy.
"But militancy pays,” she said.
‘'Though we have never had strikes, we
may turn to them. Our dedication in
not wanting to leave the patients has
been exploited as weakness. But nurses
are beginning to think of walking out.
There are ways of getting round the
problems of sick patients. They can
offer to nurse seriously ill patients at
home without charge and they can give
long notice of their intention to strike.
It could be a limited strike where only
those who cannot be moved will be
nursed. All these things are being dis-
cussed now, where no one would have
dreamed of this even a few years ago.
Nurses must be paid in relationship to
their responsibility and skills.”
Miss Stanliand feels that there must
be monetary compensation for a profes-
sion which requires its members to
work at night and weekends.
She has not much time for the sug-
gestion that strength might come from
an amalgamation of all the associations
interested in nursing, specifically the
ATNA and the N.S.W. Nurses’ Associa-
tion.
“We are also professional nurses,” she
said. “The ATNA cannot, in any shape
or form, cover the problems of nursing.
Nothing was done for nurses until
1932. The ATNA was weak. It didn’t
see the dangers when the Nurses’
Registration Board was formed in 1927.
And only one body can be registered
as a trade union.”
On the other hand, the ATNA is
eager to join the union, though accept-
ing the fact that combining constitu-
tions may be difficult. They feel
strongly that they are not represented
on the Registration Board. The N.S.W.
Nurses’ Association is sometimes criti-
cised for being an old-fashioned union
without adequate research facilities.
Meanwhile, back at the Board, Mrs.
B. Lyons and Miss M. Steele are nurse
advisers and though they cannot speak
officially seem optimistic about the suc-
cessful implementation of the three-vear
course, which looks as though it will
gradually be introduced.
In the midst of all this industrial
strife it is cheering to note that the
patient is still the first consideration
in the hospital. Though until the award
is dealt with favorably it might be
better to stay healthy.

New Zealand looks back in langor
By DAVID McGILL
NEW ZEALAND AND Australia are
today as similar as chalk and cream
cheese. Both are white and have much
the same heritage—except for the con-
victs, New Zealand would add. There
the similarities end. New Zealand re-
mains what Australia was before the
post-war industrial boom, before Aus-
tralia had begun to mine her minerals
and step up steel production, to break
with the traditional English market in
favor of closer customers for her pri-
mary produce, and to build up her labor
forces with a vigorous immigration
drive.
New Zealand does not have the
minerals, the commercial urgency, and
industrial purpose, the readiness to
break with Britain or the desire for
national or population growth of Aus-
tralia. New Zealand takes her relatively
few immigrants from Britain and the
Commonwealth largely because she
thinks she should. New Zealand does
not want outsiders in her green and
pleasant land. New Zealand’s immigra-
tion and economic policies are about as
modern as the English spoken by
Appalachian hillbillies. Neither immi-
gration laws nor economic practices
have changed in any basic way this cen-
tury. New Zealand wants to stay the
way Australia used to be.
New Zealand immigration policy was
frozen by the Chinese Immigrants
Amended Act of 1896 and the Act to
Restrict Immigration into New Zealand
of 1899. Chinese were listed as undesir-
able immigrants because, it was acknow-
ledged, they were too industrious.
Richard John Seddon, one of New Zea-
land’s most famous Prime Ministers,
expressed the view that there were no
people more evil or more likely to
corrupt, and his view met with general
approval.
Since 1946 immigration has accounted
for half of Australia’s growth rate and
one quarter of New Zealand’s. Australia
has gathered her immigrants from most
European countries, New Zealand has
drawn 90 percent from the Common-
wealth; of the others, half have been
Dutch and most of the remainder
American. Experts have asserted that
even with a West European style of
farming New Zealand could support
eight to ten times the present popula-
tion. The Japanese islands are 40 per-
cent larger than New Zealand’s and
support 40 times as many people. New
Zealand’s determination to remain small
is as compelling as Switzerland’s deter-
mination to remain neutral.
New Zealand has always lived off the
fat of her land. Almost as soon as she
was producing, New Zealand was ship-
ping her butter, wool, meat, and cheese
12,000 miles to a ready market in the
Mother Country. The handsome returns
enabled New Zealand to move rapidly
out of the pioneer phase into settled, in-
stitutionalised life. New Zealand’s wel-
fare benefits won her the title of “social
laboratory of the world,” a genuine
People’s Palace.
The benefits that have accrued from
a productive one-crop economy, well-
developed State services, and restricted
immigration are indeed enviable. In few
other countries do most citizens own a
quarter-acre estate and are also likely to
have a bach beside a quiet strip of
beach, State aid for a man’s children
and his parents, such an attractive
national playground, freedom from class
inequalities and racial ugliness, free
education and medical care, and a
secure job. One of New Zealand’s
proudest boasts was that she was unique
among capitalist countries in having 30
years of full employment. This looks like
a paradise, a utopia, and, in fact, many
New Zealanders call it “God’s own
country.”
Not many months after what
“Newsweek” called the “liberal-socialist
Holyoake Government” was returned
on the slogan “You’ve never had it'so
good,” the South Sea Bubble burst.
New Zealand began to look a little like
a fool’s paradise. An English woman
immigrant complained in an Auckland
newspaper that she wished she had
stuck it out in England because New
Zealand’s economy seemed to be just
as unstable.
What happened at first did not
warrant the panic. Wool prices had
dropped overseas and the Wool Com-
mission was using up its reserves to buy
most of the wool clip at the price
guaranteed to the sheep farmer. Export
receipts were still high. Then came
Black Friday, February 10, this year,
when the Government announced the
lifting of subsidies on flour and butter,
increased rentals on State houses, and
other measures designed to curb internal
spending, which hit hardest at the wage-
earner. The housewives and the Fed-
eration of Labor howled and the Labor
Opposition jumped up, and with an
accusing finger charged that the Gov-
ernment had duped the people in
November about the state of the
economy. When unemployment figures
began to appear and creep up through
the thousands, New Zealanders began
to get really worried. They also began
to get resentful when their defence
allies not only did not help but seemed
to be aggravating the crisis. The United
States cut down on a promising beef
and cheese market and Australia seemed
to be swamping New Zealand with
manufactured goods and not taking
anything in return. New Zealanders
became somewhat petulant about going
on to slightly reduced rations. In the
1930 s everybody was in the same boat,
so why are we having a depression on
our own?
From the viewpoint of other countries
the New Zealand situation did not look
bad. Wool prices are low everywhere
at present and such a minimal total of
the labor force unemployed as per-
cent is a position they would very much
like to be in. New Zealanders still seem
to be pretty well off.
The reason New Zealanders are
growling so much is the set of attitudes
and expectations they have developed
in their long spell of splendid isolation.
New Zealanders have had the aware-
ness forced on * them that not only
are they isolated but also alone in
the face of the realities of modern
competition. They did not realise how
old-fashioned the notion was that if
you subscribe to a defence pact your
allies will as readily trade with you.
They feel jilted.
The present minor crisis has such
shock value, because under a long spell
of stability New Zealanders have grown
to feel that a stable economy is some-
thing natural which they have a right
to a proletarian version of the divine
right of kings. New Zealanders proudly
believe they have had a more equitable
and relaxed society than other
countries. In New Zealand, Jack is his
own master, and tipping and forelock-
tugging are almost non-existent. If Wel-
lington were to emulate New York, the
statue would be, instead of liberty, a
Statue of Equality. It is taken as a
compliment when a visitor complains
that it is hard to get service.
This is the only kind of criticism
that is acceptable; that is, criticism
which reinforces the national self-image.
New Zealanders see themselves as
reserved and honorable like the Eng-
hsh but more hospitable. The “Aussies”
they see as brash the “Yanks” as even
brasher and toth ever y addicted to
cha mg the almighty dollar, NZers are
particularly proud of the way they have
handled the racial situation, and w,l
snort disbel.ev.ngly at the occasional
report of a Maori refused accommoda-
non or service. As soon as visitors
T'l J 1 are f ked A°u ü beaUt,ful
hey find the country and told how con-
tented its people are. Disagreement let
alone disapproval, is not anticipated. A
few years ago American sociologist
David Ausubel suggested that there
were strong undercurrents of prejudice
and was personally vilified and told to
go home and clean up his own back-
yard. Earlier this year English author
Iris Murdoch got a cool reception when
she said that she thought it curious that
at social gatherings the men congre-
gated at one end of the room and the
women at the other.
. . .
W at is even more curious, particu-
larly considering the large proportion
of nonconformist stock, is the mother
fixation. While Australian newspapers '
scream about breaking ties with Britain,
New Zealand newspapers, especially the
provincial ones, carry regular features
on royal family gossip, what Princess
Anne wore at breakfast, and what
Queen Elizabeth said when she poured
out tea for the bricklayer’s wife. A
member of royalty on the cover of a
magazine sells many more copies than
the most popular television star. In this
way New Zealand is more British than
the British now want to be

has also been active, and now television,
with writers working alongside pro-

The influence of the intellectual
community is reflected in a more liberal
book and film censorship than in the
United States or Australia. “Blow-up”
and most Swedish films have made it
uncut, and even “Ulysses,” though
shown to segregated audiences (includ-
Prime Ministers Holyoake and Holt: no amalgamation
i n g a group of Sydney businessmen
flown over for the occasion). The book
“Ulysses” has never been banned, and
the liberal book censorship board,
the Indecent Publications Tribunal, has
not restricted the works of Nabokov,
J. P. Dunleavy, or Henry Miller.
New Zealand’s problems are econ-
omic, not social, although the econ-
omic position could conceivably depress
the middle-class society to a working-
class level. Isolation, plenty of room,
productive land, and the impossibility
of being very rich or very poor have
maintained New Zealanders as 19th-
century individual entrepreneurs. New
Zealanders tend to be independent
farmers, zealous and incorruptible
public servants, and small business-
men; the truck-driver is likely to own
his truck. Recently some grocers have
been opting out of the co-operative
chainstores in favor of independence.
Although New Zealanders have the
attitudes of an independent nation,
they _ are slung with a dependent
colonial economy. New Zealand pro-
duces and ships off her foods and
fibres in a crude, largely unprocessed
form. Almost 90 percent of her exports
derive from grass, and 90 percent of
the processing is done by sheep and
cows.
Through her years of prosperity,
New Zealand has remained vulnerable
because she has a one-crop economy
dependent on overseas prices, is under-
industrialised, and lacks capital. The
New Zealand Government has not
found new markets or fostered new
manufacturing industries, so the
country has remained dependent on the
British markets and overseas borrowing.
What the National Government has
done is bring New Zealand under the
thumb of international finance. One of
the conditions of belonging to the
International Monetary Fund is that a
country must put freedom of exchange
and foreign investment before full em-
ployment. The Government blames the
present difficulties on the drop in
international wool prices, mutters about
the need to ease over-employment, and
carefully avoids the question of loans.
While there has been borrowing in
recent years, there has been no minus
figure in trade receipts. From 1961-
66 the surplus of exports over imports
was $N.Z.400 million. The red figures
appear after freight (half the surplus
figure), profits and internal Govern-
ment spending have been totted up.
Last year total Government receipts
were $N.Z.1038 million and total pay-
ments $N.Z.1084, and the receipts in-
cluded SN.Z.SO million from the IMF.
On short-term borrowing alone, New
Zealand must pay back over SN.Z.4O
million each year for the next five years.
Under loan terms and trade agree-
ments, monopoly capitalism is at last

getting freely into New Zealand. The
doors to foreign investors have not been
opened to anywhere near the extent
that they have in Australia, where such
large complexes as petroleum, motor-
vehicles, and pharmaceuticals are
almost completely foreign owned and
controlled. However, in the crucial
area of manufacturing, foreign suppliers
have been allowed to set up factories
and retain their markets for such items
as domestic appliances, meat freezing,
plastics, engineering, electronics, ship-
ping, advertising, building, and
accountancy. Each year about 40 per-
cent of manufacturing profits go over-
seas, each year a few percent more. As
for New Zealand’s primary produce,
that is carried in British ships under
British insurance, and 60 percent of the
trading banks are overseas owned. Of
New Zealand’s five banks, one is home-
grown, two are English, two are Aus-
tralian.
Prime Minister Holyoake continues
to exude optimism. He knows that if
he does not and the New Zealand pub-
lic sense that the trouble is any more
than temporary, his Government will
be out. Labor is usually voted in to
deal w r ith an emergency. It has been
predicted that Keith Holyoake, now in
his mid-sixties, will step down before
the next election. It looks very much
as if Honest Jack Marshall will inherit
a sinking ship. In the elections last
November the Labor Opposition did
not put up much of a fight, but they
had not long ditched revered elder
politician Arnold Nordmeyer in favor
of Norman Kirk, a huge man in his
early forties, whom the New Zealand
public did not know. The Prime Minis-
ter was blamed about the country’s
prosperity and there were no definite
indications that he was not correct.
Even so, the National Government only
polled percent of the vote. An
unexpectedly large share of the vote
went to Social Credit, indicating the
dissatisfaction of the voters with the
two major parties.
This situation is now changing. The
country is hearing from Norman Kirk
quite a lot. All he is doing is asking
questions. Why is the Wool Commission
buying up new-season wool instead of
selling it at a reduced price? Why did
the Government reject outright Russia’s
offer to buy all New Zealand’s stockpile
of wool on a generous trade exchange
basis? Why should the rest of the coun-
try support the high incomes of the
sheep farmers? Why is the wage-earner
the main target of Government meas-
ures? Why is the Government creating
“a pool of unemployment?” Why is
Government spending going up instead
of down? Why no import controls? The
trade unions, quiet for so long, are
holding stopworks and winning public
support over the Government’s con-
temptuous dismissals of their com-
plaints. The Labor Party has not come
out with any remedies, and at present
it does not have to.
The National Government has neither
sunk nor swum. When Argentina' de-
valued and sold its wool stock, New
Zealand inherited her problem. The
National Government has held on to
the wool, avoided devaluation so far,
and deflated carefully and minimally.
What the Government cannot do is
drastically cut import licences and
rapidly diversify. What can New
Zealand do?
Dr. W. B. Sutch, who appeared as
a belligerent nationalist (nation, not
political party) on the “Four Corners”
program on New Zealand, suggests that
his country should become a Switzer-
land of the South Pacific, become
known for quality manufacturing, not
rely solely on primary produce. New
Zealand does not have the resources or
people to support heavy and light indus-
tries, but she could develop skill.
Already New Zealand engineering has
gained a reputation overseas for certain
precision components for heavy vehicles.
What New Zealand needs is to be
internationally known for something
like this, as the Swiss are for their
watches or Sweden for cutlery. Dr.
Sutch was eased out of his job as Sec-
retary of Industries and Commerce
because he was considered out of line
with Government and business interests.
The next election three years away is as
far as a New Zealand Government ever
looks, and this is probably a national
characteristic.
New Zealand’s only resemblance to
Switzerland so far is her refusal to
change her outlook; the Swiss will not
give their women universal suffrage,
New Zealand will not change her dis-
like of industry and preference for
farming. Plans recently put before the
Government for an all-New Zealand
car met with little response. The new
and extraordinarily successful carpet
industry, which recently won the Hong
Kong Hilton order for 11 miles of
carpet, almost seems an anomaly. The
diversification of agriculture, which is
still seen as grass and grass only, the
development of mining and fishing, ex-
pansion of industries based on New
Zealand resources and imported raw
materials—all are under-emphasised.
Wool, wood, fish, and scenery could be
the basis for a booming secondary
industry.
Instead, the Government spends
money on widening, straightening, seal-
ing, and replacing roads, on compre-
hensive electric power coverage and
commercial buildings. Its priorities re-
flect national attitudes. This Welfare
State has always tended to cosset and
consume rather than invest and expand.
Easy sufficiency has made New
Zealanders easy-going. The immigration
laws are certainly not going to admit
the incentive of German industriousness
or Italian gusto. Heavy taxes on higher
incomes and few incentives do not
cocounage manufacturers to step up pro-
du.ctinn. In New Zealand few people

Nowhere is New Zealand’s con-
servatism more obvious than in her
grip on the British market. Although
aware that Britain is trying to cut the
apron strings, New Zealand still prefers
to send her agricultural surplus to the
area of highest farming efficiency and
food intake in the world. Australia has
scotched the argument that Asia is too
poor to buy the produce of a capitalist
country. Mutton and milk may be
luxuries outside of Japan, but wheat,
wool, and wood have markets in Asia
that are going to get a lot bigger.
Lack of commitment to a rapid
development drive is most apparent in
the tourist trade. New Zealand has
been called “the world’s most exciting
travel package.” It has more scenic
diversity rolled into 100,000 square
miles than you get on whole continents
thermal, alpine, fiords, and lakes,
big-game and trout fishing, deer and
wild pig to hunt, fine beaches you
name it. To the New Zealander all
this is seen not as an exploitable tourist
commodity but as his own playground.
To the New Zealander, tourism is a
degrading way of making a living or
earning foreign exchange. The egali-
tarian NZer hates providing personal
service for foreigners. Some attention
is paid to attracting Australians and
Americans, but the United Kingdom
and Asian markets are virtually un-
tapped; most of New Zealand’s tourists
are New Zealanders.
At present New Zealand is still
flinching from her first real contact with
the realities of the modern business-
oriented society, namely, the lack of
reaction from Australia and the States
for her present difficulties. New Zea-
landers are beginning to realise that
they cannot just live off their land
any more, but must dress up the yield
to tempt the eye and please the palate
of other nations. The attitude that we
don’t have to worry for a while longer
is still current because Britain cannot
persuade De Gaulle to let them in.
However, Britain’s determination to get
into the EEC has also been noted. The
newspaper editorials continue to say
that New Zealand must be equally
determined to gain preferences from
Britain, but they no longer sound so
hopeful.
As yet there is no sense of urgency,
not even in Auckland, where most of
the industry and a quarter of the
population is. The tourist, timber, steel,
and fishing industries, the diversifica-
tion of agricultural products, and the
search for new markets are all gaining
momentum. They are still slow by
overseas standards, but New Zealanders
are too isolated to feel the spurs of
competition and reluctant to change
their way of life. The one factor they
are aggressive about is retaining their
national identity: amalgamation with
Australia is out of the question. How-
ever, if the situation does get tough,
New Zealanders have enough experi-
ence of tramping and climbing to
know how to survive alone in the bush.




INTERNATIONAL GRAB
By CHARLES HIGHAM
“SOON,” WRITES THE French critic
Gilles Jacob, in the current issue of
“Sight and Sound,” “there may not be
a French cinema at all. Just an Ameri-
can annex, Hollywood-sur-Seine.”
Plollywood-on-Thames, too; if one
were asked to sum up in two words
the British and French situation in
1967, one would reply: Hollywood
takeover. While studios in Hollywood
itself are being absorbed by non-film
companies (dealing in oil and real
estate most typically), and their own
assets are being reinvested in hotels and
apartment blocks on their own land,
overseas they are spreading their ten-
tacles very wide, and they have
rescued the French film industry from
disaster, receiving in return for spend-
ing 75 percent of budget on French
actors and technicians a special govern-
ment subsidy.
At least 70 percent of “British”
features these days are financed by
Americans, and many are directed by
Americans as well: Stanley Kubrick,
Joseph Losey, Martin Ritt, and the
late Anthony Mann are obvious cases
in point. It is a bonanza for New
York-Hollywood financiers: the British
supply Americans with Eady money —
funds levied on ticket sales and
ploughed into production—and cheaper
crews than those available in Cali-
fornia. In return, Hollywood provides
100 percent finance, thus preventing
British film-makers from going through
the exhausting process of trying to find
capitalisation on the spot. Even the
Bond films, so often thought to be
kinkily British, are in fact really Ameri-
can: produced by Broccoli and Saltz-
man, two Hollywood small-time pro-
ducers who “made it big” only when
they crossed the Atlantic.
In the wake of the Hollywood inva-
sion, the short-lived neo-realist British
movement of the ’fifties —which pro-
duced men like Lindsay Anderson, Tony
Richardson, Karel Reisz, John Schle-
singer, and Brian Forbes—has sunk
without a trace, although Forbes does
still manage to make films in a similar
mode. Anderson has, honorably, with-
drawn from the scene, unable to make
the kind of realistic picture he wants.
The career of Tony Richardson, after
the huge commercial success of “Tom
Jones,” has foundered with such
worse - than - mediocre films as
“Mademoiselle” and “The Sailor from
Gibraltar,” critical and commercial
disasters starring the fashionable baggy-
eyed Jeanne Moreau. Karel Reisz has
turned from the uneasily pretentious
“Morgan” to the large-scale, Holly-
wood-style epic, his life of Isadora
Duncan with Vanessa Redgrave, and
John Schlesinger has “gone big-time”
with “Far From the Madding Crowd,”
a large, lush, colored production based
on Hardy’s novel.
So American has the scene become
that it’s impossible to think of a film
like “Two For The Road,” directed by
Stanley Donen, as English at all.
In France, too, so often believed to
be culturally autonomous, the Holly-
wood takeover has been drastic. The
latest films of Louis Malle, Roger
Vadim, Claude Chabrol, Rene
Clement, Francois Truffaut, and
Philippe de Broca have all been
American-financed.
The cause is clear: French films,
though delightful to the intelligentsia,
are often made in defiance of the
public. Gilles Jacob has pointed out
that although 20 percent of national
production finance comes from a
government subsidy fund, 4000 million-
odd francs were lost in 1966. The
troubles are many: too many small
companies competing for the available
subsidy, too little capital, production
costs that rise more steeply every year,
and the endless problem of raising
independent finance. The State refuses
to give tax relief, or to increase its
subsidy. No French bank will agree to
invest more than a small amount (in
film terms) in a picture. So French film-
makers turn more and more desperately
to America for help, with a resulting
increase in big and smartly fashionable
films, and a gradual disappearance of
the old, modest, black-and-white work
of the vanished “New Wave.”
“Without American money there
would be no French films with famous
stars or a number of elaborate sets,”
wrote Pierre Billard in “L’Express.”
“At the present rate,” Gilles Jacob
writes in “Sight and Sound,” “we shall
quite soon be seeing French films pre-
sented at festivals under the auspices
of the Star Spangled Banner.” All this
should prove salutary knowledge for
film-makers here anxious for govern-
ment help along French lines: in the
state of the cinema today, no govern-
ment can save a company from
foundering if its product is not wholly
commercial.
Hollywood, of course, is cock-a-hoop
about its invasion of the United King-
dom and the Continent, and its own
house is, for the present at least, very
much in order: 1967 may not be quite
such a vintage year as 1946, the high
peak of the fabulous ’forties, but the
last twelve-month promises to yield
close to 200 million dollars in profits,
and by Christmas at least 200 features
will have been produced.
Apart from its shrewd foreign invest-
ments, two things have saved Holly-
wood from disaster: road shows and the
sales of the studios’ back product to
television. Road shows—films booked
across the nation in prestige theatres,
Hollywood-sur-Seine. Roger Vadim making
bulk of the finance and the profits are
“The Game Is Over,” with his wife, Jane Fanda. The inspiration is French, but the
American
with specific high prices for admission
and only two screenings a day—demand
for their success a lavish budget, a
heavy roster of star names, and often
color, with a budget running into
several million dollars. They have the
capacity to wipe out at a blow a studio’s
losses: “The Longest Day,” for instance,
turned Twentieth Century-Fox’s 40-
million-dollar deficit (largely caused by
the fiasco of “Cleopatra”) into a 12.5-
million-dollar profit figure. Since then
“Those Magnificent Men in Their Fly-
ing Machines,” “The Sand Pebbles,”
and, above all, the phenomenal “Sound
of Music” have also done well, and the
studio has high hopes for “Star!” its
lavish tribute to Gertrude Lawrence,
starring Julie Andrews, now the most
powerful and highly paid actress in
Hollywood.
Television sales have also proved
vastly profitable. In September, 1966, a
new era began when “The Bridge on
the River Kwai” was shown on tele-
vision. It was watched by sixty million
people, and the rating for “Bonanza
and Ed Sullivan on other channels ■suf-
fered severely. Almost at once T
networks started a goldrush for the
prints of major films made after IJS
and not previously sold. Paramount so
32 pictures to ABC for 20 million
dollars, Fox sold 17 pictures to the
same network for almost exactly t e
same figure, and MGM sold 51 ms
to CBS for 53 million. .
But there is a worm in the iu> .
many financial experts believe that e
studios are running through their back-
log too fast and selling it too quickly;
that if they could hang on for a few
more years they would be able to
liquidate their assets at a more profit-
able rate. It has been pointed out that
many studios would be better dead
than alive, since if they sold their back-
log without making new and unprofit-
able pictures there would be nothing to
deduct from the sales figures, and no
overheads, rentals, or maintenance
costs. In reply, the studio bosses point
to one or two blockbusters a year, the
production of which is sufficient, they
claim, to justify a studio’s existence.
> The trend is more and more toward
a Hollywood ruled by non-film men,
by bankers and real-estate agents who
know all too little about the business
of making profitable films, though they
may know about juggling finances to
prevent excessive expenditure. It is a
peiiod of takeovers: Paramount was
recently absorbed by Gulf Oil and
Western for a sum of 165 million
dollars; MGM just missed being taken
over by real-estate magnate Philip J.
Levin, and Warners has been absorbed
mj;o Seven Arts.
On the surface, Hollywood glitters
with prosperity: the minks and Cadil-
acs outside the Beverly Hills Hotel
shine as brightly as ever, parties
spaikle with diamonds and conversa-
tion of a ruthless brightness that is
P , eculiarl y Californian. But these endless
mifts and mergers cause a lethal
e nsion: at Paramount, for instance,
when I was there in June, the mood
had a thundercloud oppressiveness.
The former actor and 7th Avenue
clothier Bob Evans, Paramount’s new
boss, played Irving Thalberg in a film
of the life of Lon Chaney some years
back, but his cool, driving personality
is different altogether from Thalberg’s
erratic genius, and it is significant of
modern Hollywood that he has to report
every executive decision to a lawyer in
New York.
Evans has tightened budgets, infuri-
ated several producers (including Hal
B. Wallis, who made a fortune for the
studio with the Elvis Presley pictures),
and closed down the studio’s interna-
tional publicity office, firing its chief,
Rose Goldstein, a life-long studio em-
ployee. Whether Charles Bluhdorn, head
of Gulf Oil and Western, and Bob
Evans can between them produce a
strong line-up of box-office winners is
still in doubt, and the future not
especially encouraging: hard to see big
box-office results in America from
Roman Polanski’s witchcraft story
“Rosemary’s Baby,” “The President’s
Analyst,” or “The Odd Couple,”
although the studio has cast gilt-edged
stars Julie Andrews and Barbra
Streisand in other forthcoming films.
At Warners, the big plunge has been
on “Camelot,” a film reportedly
dogged by production difficulties, with
Richard Harris, the star, taking over
the direction of several scenes himself.
Warners also are bullish about “Reflec-
tions in a Golden Eye,” from the novel
by Carson McCullers, written and
directed by John Huston, with Eliza-
beth Taylor and Marlon Brando in the
leads, while Fox have in the offing
‘'Dr. Dolittle,” a musical version of
Hugh Lofting’s children’s stories.
To succeed, films must feature one
of the major stars, most of whom can
claim between one and two million
dollars a picture. Julie Andrews, after
the success of both “Mary Poppins”
an d The Sound of Music,” can write
her own ticket, and she is being rushed
from picture to picture; Hollywood has
hopes that Barbra Streisand in “Funny
Girl” may succeed equally, but that
will depend very heavily on whether
a quality of charm, of niceness, and
family-appeal wholesomeness comes
through on the screen (stage stars have
been disasters before). Many of the
old-time directors bitterly resent the
power of the new stars, remembering
an age when stars were on long-term
contract and simply ordered into film
after film on pain of long suspension.
Despite the confident look of Holly-
wood in the ’sixties, the future looks
worrying to many; not enough prop-
erties suitable for the million-dollar
look, studio backlogs being eaten up
too fast by TV, stars getting fewer and
demanding more and more. In an effort
to improve matters, several studios, led
by Universal, have begun making films
for television, eschewing domestic
theatre showing altogether. Universal
recently gambled 15 million dollars on
launching a series of features made of
medium - budget level and starring
second-string actors; the initial results
were encouraging. These so-called
“World Premiere” presentations are
shown only once, so that audiences, feel
obliged to tune in for a “unique experi-
ence.” Made in a hurry (15 in a period
of ten months), shot fairly roughly,
they approximate to the old B-pictures,
and are sold in packages to NBC by
MCA, controlling body of Universal.
Some, of these films are resold for
theatrical television showing in other
countries, including Australia.
Blockbusters, backlog sales, films for
television: all these are a far cry from
the exciting days when Hollywood was
Babylon. But, as everyone knows, art
is not even the pretended concern of
the Hollywood moguls: in an industry
more subject to panic and recession
than most others, ways and means have
constantly to be found of prying the
spectator loose from club or TV set.
Something of the attitude of Hollywood
producers to artistic matters can be
gauged from a remark made by one
recently to a visitor who admired a
Toulouse-Lautrec on his study wall:
“Oh, yes, that was a great picture,
wasn’t it?”

OVERSEAS
For Britain: Indian Ocean
strategy —or bird sanctuary?
BRITAIN’S BASES east of Suez are
going one by one. By the end of the
month the last British troops will be
gone from Aden. By. 1975 at the latest
the bases in Singapore and Malaysia
will be closed, and those in the Persian
Gulf probably will be, too. Britain’s
ability to provide immediate military
aid to anyone in the Indian Ocean who
needs it will then rest with three forces.
The first is a seaborne commando of
850 men, probably based in Western
Australia. The second is a brigade of
three battalions, plus support troops,
making 3000 men in all, stationed in
Britain as part of the strategic reserve.
The third is the reconnaissance and
fighter-bomber squadrons that the
Royal Air Force could send to the help
of local armies. All three together make
up only a tiny force. It probably could
not be used at all unless a local govern-
ment calls upon Britain for help, for
it would need to make an unopposed
“red carpet” landing. If it is to be a
credible military weapon, it will have
to be got out to the spot very fast
indeed.
That is what puts Aldabra on the
strategic map. The British and Ameri-
can Governments are still trying to
make up their minds whether to
develop this tiny British atoll north-
west of Malagasy as a staging post for
troop-carrying aircraft and fighter-
bombers. They will have to decide soon,
for the 12,000 ft. runway, the storage
tanks, the berthing jetty, the radio
station, transit facilities and quarters
for around 200 men will take three or
four years to build. But a great many
scientists and other people are opposing
the idea of slapping a military post on
to one of the few remaining places in
the world that is still relatively free of
human contamination.
The main objection of the opponents
of the scheme has nothing to do with
money or strategy. It is simply that
Aldabra is an unspoiled island, and they
do not want it spoiled. Itjhas not been
ruined by guano diggers. There is a
fishing settlement, and the fishermen
have their own vegetable patches; a few
goats, dogs, cats, and rats run wild.
But otherwise this coral atoll preserves
a primitive balance of nature practically
untouched by man. The island has its
own inbred species of flightless rails
and other unique birds; like the Gala-
pagos islands, it has giant tortoises; and
it is the main breeding ground for
frigate birds in the Indian Ocean. The
scientists want the birds and the giant
tortoises to be unharmed. More than
this, they want the integrity of a natural
laboratory to be preserved intact.
Against the certain loss in the natural
sphere must be set the possible gains in
another: the protection of countries
fringing the Indian Ocean that are start-
ing to build democratic systems against
the hostile forces that might threaten
them with either a communist dictator-
ship or a Right-wing tyranny. The
British must decide whether they want
to be able, if necessary, to help save one
or two of these countries from violent
subjection to other people’s ambitions
or whether they want to preserve Alda-
bra’s ecology.
This is why the decision about
Aldabra is important. For Britain its
development could well be the test
case of how far it is willing to back
up its convictions in the Indian Ocean.
Even with Aldabra, the British are not
going to be able to do very much east
of Suez. Without Aldabra, they can
count on being able to do hardly any-
thing.
A staging post on this atoll would
provide a third military air route into
the Indian Ocean. There are at present
two routes. Eastabout across the Middle
East to Gan in the Maidive Islands and
westabout across North America and
the American bases in the Pacific. If
either of these routes were out of action,
Aldabra would be very valuable, indeed.
Why Aldabra in particular, when
there are so many other islands around
the place? The first reason is that there
would be no local political difficulties
about the use of Aldabra, because
Aldabra happens to be uninhabited.
So are some other islands. But most
of the other islands are either too small
or the wrong shape for a runway that
can cope with the prevailing south-east
wind, while others have deeply shelving
waters that rule out adequate berth-
ing facilities for ships. And on the Good
Hope route Aldabra lies close to the
critical flying distance: to fly on another
150 miles to Farquhar would reduce the
payload of a VC 10 by 20 percent.
Lastly, there is the question of cost.
Aldabra would be the cheapest island
to develop. The bill seems likely to be
more than the £2O million usually
talked about; £3O million might be
nearer the mark. It is not a large sum
of money for a major strategic gain.
The Saturn V rocket
A great day coming
THE STAGE had been set for so long
that it was hard to believe that the show
was beginning. The Saturn V, the
souped-up rocket put together to carry
Americans to the moon, was off at last.
Five years in the works, it was sup-
posed to have had its first test flight,
unmanned, last spring. But after three
astronauts died because of flaws in the
new spacecraft for this project (Apollo),
super-caution set in. The monumental
90,000-pound rocket was taken apart
and searched for cracks, while the
spacecraft was being redesigned.
Last Friday morning, the world knew
that the complex contraption worked as
it was intended to do. The 36-storey
rocket, with its six million pounds of
nasty-to-handle liquid oxygen and
hydrogen fuels and 41 engines, lifted
off its spanking new launching pad at
the John F. Kennedy Space Centre in
Florida, jettisoned its first and second
stages on time, started, stopped, and re-
started its third-stage engines and hurled
the empty capsule into a higher orbit.
Then the drivers’ seat portion of the
spacecraft (which itself has three parts)
re-entered the earth’s atmosphere and,
protected by its heat shield, splashed
down in the Pacific Ocean.
As big a rocket as the world is likely
to see for some time, the Saturn V is


the first American rocket which has not
been assembled on the launching pad;
instead it was put together and tested
indoors —in the world’s largest build-
ing and transported gingerly to its
launching site late in August. The
advantages of this “mobile concept”
are that the rocket is protected from
the weather and spends less time on
the pad, leaving this free for other
launchings.
NASA still hopes to put an American
on the moon before the arbitrary dead-
line —the end of the decade, or Decem-
ber 31, 1969 —set by President Ken-
nedy in 1961. The lunar excursion
module the Lem or bug which
will make the actual touchdown on the
moon when the great day comes, with
two astronauts aboard, will get one
extra unmanned test next year. This
change may slow NASA down. So may
the budget cuts just delivered by Con-
gress. The U. 5.54.6 billion allowed to
NASA for the current fiscal year is less
by half a million dollars than was
sought.
The U.S. and Vietnam
The doves' coup
CITIES, GOVERNOR REAGAN of
California said, should not have foreign
policies. On this, at least, the Adminis-
tration agreed with him. It was careful
not to dignify with open opposition San
Francisco’s referendum on the war in
Vietnam. By Wednesday last week it
may have regretted its caution. For on.
Tuesday San Francisco, home of the
hippies and close to the anti-war centre
of Berkeley, defeated resoundingly a
proposition' which called for the im-
mediate withdrawl of American troops
from Vietnam. Last year in Dearborn,
Michigan, the same proposal was
approved by 40 percent of the voters;
in San Francisco only 37 percent voted
“yes.” Yet it had been expected to be
a close thing and had overshadowed the
lacklustre contest for Mayor. The
proposition was couched in such un-
compromising terms that some critics
of the war found it impossible to vote
for it. But its supporters were well
organised and many were highly
respectable.
It was at Berkeley that Senator
Eugene McCarthy chose to call on the
Secretary of State, Dean Rusk, to re-
sign and on “top Democrats” to sup-
port those who were willing to “carry
the flag” against President Johnson un-
less he reverses his Vietnam policies.
Shortly afterward Senator McCarthy
conceded that he himself might carry
that flag in next year’s presidential
primaries to give Democrats an alter-
native choice for the nomination. Mc-
Carthy is well liked, a liberal and a
Roman Catholic, whose ambition in
1964 to be Johnson’s Vice-President
were frustrated by his fellow Minne-
sotan, Hubert Humphrey. If opposition
to the war spreads and deepens, Sen-
ator McCarthy might do damage in a
few States. But obviously he is no
realist. It is almost inconceivable that
the party would —or could —repudiate
its President, a fact long recognised by
Senator Robert Kennedy.
Yet doubts about the war can pop
up in unlikely places, the Supreme
Court, for example. Three private
soldiers, sentenced to three years in a
military prison for refusing to fight, in
Vietnam, have had their plea fpr a
hearing rejected as raising issues btfypnd
the Court’s jurisdiction; they argued
that the war was illegal. But two
Justices, Mr. Douglas and Mr. Stewart,
felt that the cases should at least have
been heard; to Justice Stewart, a solid
conservative, they raised “deeply
troubling questions” about the consti-
tutionality of an undeclared war.
Justice Stewart only raised the ques-
tions. A few months ago Senator Ful-
bright, the chairman of the Foreign
Relations Committee, hoped to answer
them indirectly with a resolution mak-
ing it clear that, in future, foreign com-
mitments must have the sanction of
Congress. But last week there were so
many doubts about whether this was
the time to seem to be rebuking the
President that Senator Fulbright has
virtually washed his hands of the pro-
ject already watered down.
Soviet-Cuba relations
Sweet and sour
RELATIONS BETWEEN Russia and
Cuba . are becoming increasingly
strained, both ideologically and in the
field of trade. But the Soviet leaders
are trying to avert an open split, which
would produce another rift in the com-
munist camp.
According to Latin-American diplo-
mats in Moscow last week, Cuba has
refused to keep its promise to sell five
million tons of sugar to Russia next
year. This year the amount will be
4,200,000 tons. The agreement signed
in 1964 was for a progressive rise in
sugar supplies between 1964 and 1970.
It was assumed that Cuba would find
it more difficult to sell sugar on the
international market and that produc-
tion in Cuba would go on rising. Both
of these calculations have proved wrong.
Production has not reached the level
expected, and the Cubans now feel con-
fident of selling more sugar.
They are also annoyed because some
of their exports to Russia are resold in
the open market.
There are also signs of ideological
strain between the two countries. Presi-
dent Dorticos, of Cuba, cancelled a visit
to Moscow for the October jubilee
celebrations.
In Cuba, Fidel Castro and President
Dorticos were present at the Soviet
Embassy reception for the occasion, but
there was no message of congratula-
tions in Moscow from Fidel Castro.
Cambodia
Princely diplomacy
IT WAS A splendid week for Prince
Sihanouk of Cambodia. He was able to
balance the visit of Mrs. Jacqueline
Kennedy with China’s return .to its old
commonsense policy toward Cambodia
and all this took place in front of
the first large group of Westejm jour-
nalists allowed into the country since
President de Gaulle’s visit last year.
Prince Sihanouk’s only problem is that
the brilliance of his diplomacy may so
dazzle some people that they fail to
see its one basic principle.
This principle, as all independent
observers in Phnom Penh seem to agree,
is a passionate belief that Cambodia
must be saved from the surrounding
turmoil in South-East Asia and that
only a policy of the strictest neutralism
can achieve this. This policy, it cannot
be said too firmly, is neither pro-
Communist nor anti-American. In fact,
a few days in Phnom Penh are enough
to assure a visitor that China is Cam-
bodia’s main worry and will remain
so for many years.
The Cambodians have accepted
China’s return to moderation in its
attitude toward theih with relief but
also with some reserve. They are
pleased it has happened, but would not
bet on how long it will last. Their
anxiety is all the greater because there

are a quarter of a million Chinese
living in a country of little more than
six million people. The Chinese
Embassy’s grip on these has consider-
ably grown in the past two or three
years particularly through the
Chinese schools, where education has
become very political and Maoist.
By comparison, as the Cambodians
are quick to point out, America is an
artificial problem. It is argued in
Phnom Penh that the Americans should
realise that Prince Sihanouk’s Cam-
bodia is a far stronger barrier to
possible Chinese expansion than any
Americanised Cambodia would be. Mrs.
Kennedy’s visit has allowed Prince
Sihanouk to describe again the sort of
America he would be happy to get on
good terms with an America which
trusted Cambodia to go its own way.
But it would be quite wrong to
interpret Mrs. Kennedy’s visit as a sign
that Prince Sihanouk thinks that rela-
tions could improve along these lines
in the near or even semi-distant future,
He has publicly said that he has little
confidence in President Johnson and
, . , . J .
his present advisers. Ihe mam reason,
of f ; s , he Vietnam war. In the
firs , place _ Prince Sihanouk thinks a
united communist Vietnam would be a
strong barrier to China. More particu-
larly, there is the constant problem of
incidents along the border with South
Vietnam and his suspicion that one day
the Americans might find it tactically
necessary to move on to Cambodian
territory to encircle Viet Cong forces.
Singapore
Where men shrink in fear
By DENNIS BLOODWORTH
STRANGE HALLUCINATORY
scenes have been enacted in Singapore
during the past few days, noteworthy
even in this heyday of the psychedelic
“happening” and the Western sex film.
In a coffee-house lavatory, a small
crowd, drawn by cries of anguish, gape
helplessly while a middle-aged soap-
boiler clamps a pair of chopsticks over
his exposed male organ to stop it from
retreating into his body. The chop-
sticks snap. Some quick thinker sub-
stitutes a pair of market-stall steel-
yards, but these prove too unwieldy.
Panic. One bystander seizes the reticent
gender and starts pulling: another
rushes off to dial 99: a third runs for a
Chinese doctor.
This is no isolated instance. Similar
little dramas have been played in hun-
dreds of homes and sometimes in pub-
lic. A young fellow is hastily carried
down a village mainstreet in his bed
while his father jogs alongside,
clutching the prostrate youth’s mascu-
line member. Another trots down a
lane, hi's retiring nature in the firm
grasp of a friendly pacemaker. They
are on their way to the nearest clinic.
Men arrive at the outpatients’ en-
trance of hospitals with their sex
stretched downwards by dangling
weights, or held in an improvised
wooden vice, or captive on the end of
a piece of string.
For Singapore is in the grip of an
epidemic of fear. The fear is induced
by “koro,” a condition whose principal
symptom is a sudden and somewhat
alarming shrinkage of the penis. And
“koro,” being psychosomatic, is in turn
induced by fear.
The Singapore Medical Association
has, therefore, set out to allay public
alarm by making some interesting dis-
closures, if in rather monumental Eng-
lish: “The physiological causes of the
retraction of the male organ,” a Press
conference was told this week, “are
cold weather, getting into bed, and
anxiety.”
Chinese cultural beliefs are such,
however, that “those afflicted are be-
set with the great fear that should the
retraction be permitted to proceed, the
male organ would eventually be drawn
into the abdomen with a fatal out-
come. The Medical Association wish
to reassure the public that the condi-
tion of ‘koro’ leading to dsath is
definitely unknown. On the other hand,
injury may be done to the male organ
consequent upon extreme methods used
in withholding the organ from its mis-
taken retraction.”
As for the fear that it can recede into
the abdomen “medical science indi-
cates that this is not possible, as the
male organ is fundamentally an external
appendage,” the doctors conclude com-
fortably.
But Chinese males continued to clock
into the hospitals, and smiles faded as
the implications of the hysteria began
to emerge. Certain local newspapers on
their front pages had fanned the rumor
that “koro” was caught from vac-
cinated pork. The Singapore Govern-
ment issued a statement pointing out
that neither swine fever nor the vaccine
used against it could possibly affect
human beings, but few listened.
Pork sales dropped to a crawl. In the
abattoirs the daily pig-killing rate fell
from about 1300 to 100 and in the
meat markets eight out of nine despair-
ing pig butchers, who found themselves
doing less than one-tenth of their nor-
mal business, folded their shutters and
closed down. The entire trade faced
ruin overnight. Even at a banquet
thrown for doctors in a smart downtown
restaurant, pork was symbolically
conspicuous by its absence.
Practitioners of Western medicine
have their own effective cure for
“koro” —nothing. Many of them de-
cline to give the patient even an aspirin

AMPHORA
Men who prefer only the finest pipe tobacco, smoke Amphora. And for
good reason. Tobacco specialists in Holland select the world’s choicest
tobacco leaves for Amphora blends. Each leaf is masterfully mellowed
and blended to make every pipeful of Amphora consistently excellent.
And downright satisfying. So pick a pouch of Amphora . . . it’s a gentle

or a tranquilliser, so that the cure can-
not later be ascribed to pills or potions.
They simply talk the shy sufferer and
his equally shy organ out of their con-
dition.
For the condition is purely hysterical,
provoked by rumors, false reports,
“cock-and-bull stories.” All the afflicted
have been cured. None has died. “Koro”
is strictly a sickness of the mind.
Although also known among Jap-
anese, it is almost exclusively a Chinese
“cultural disease,” a product of Chinese
attitude to sex. The male member is
“yang” in Chinese, and is written with
the same ideogram as “sun.” But this
apparent glorification is deceptive, for
according to popular Chinese super-
stition the “yang” is constantly weak-
ened by the feminine counterpart, “yin.”
In the sexual act woman steals the life
essence from man.
Man, therefore, must be constantly
replenished, and the seemingly morbid
Chinese appetite for “fortifiers” and
aphrodisiacs is not prompted by a de-
sire for abnormal stimulation, *but for
vital restoratives.
Sex, therefore, is harmful. Even in
Chinese pornographic novels the virile
hero frequently ends up by dying of
it, and in real-life stories are told of
men who have passed away none too
decorously even on their wedding
nights. All Chinese advertising is geared
to this fear of fatal debilitation, which
evokes such phenomena as “koro” from
the nervous mind.
The main exploiters of the mumbo-
jumbo, however, are doctors practising
Chinese medicine, whose repulsively
illustrated advertisements in the Press
promise all things to all men—and
women. The first public move toward
curbing the quacks among these gentry
was made just before the “koro” out-
break. This has given rise to an un-
pleasant suspicion as to who started
the scare.
Chinese doctors have been much to
the fore in the fight against “koro,”
assiduously manipulating “nerve cords”
and prescribing potions, and the rumor
that vaccine has been the villain of
the drama has conveniently completed
a powerful if false propaganda equa-
tion. Western medicine has spread
poison but Chinese medicine has sup-
plied the antidote. Since the poison is
in fact non-existent the antidote is a
brilliant success.
A Government drive to destroy the
“koro” myth is very slowly bringing
the pig back' to the table, but many
educated and well-to-do Chinese are
still recoiling from pork and running
to their doctors for prophylactic ad-
vice. The claim that this pocket Repub-
lic has developed a modern and pro-
gressive society has already been shaken
by its pig-sale statistics for the past ten
days. The damage reversed quickly;
Singapore now ceases to be the “land
of the shrinking sun.”

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Talking about oil: Bolte’s
cheerful predictions
NOW FOR SIR HENRY BOLTE’S
next prediction. BHP-Esso’s target
of $172.5 million worth of oil a year
(135,000 barrels a day) from its Bass
Strait wells by 1970 would supply one-
third of Australia’s present crude oil
needs, as Sir Henry forecast a couple
of months ago. And together with 7000
barrels a day from Moonie and the
Barrow Islands target of 50,000 to
60,000 barrels a day (against about
24,000 barrels a day now), this will
make up 40 percent. But Sir Henry
also predicted (and he repeated it at
the weekend when the BHP-Esso de-
velopment decision was announced, less
than a week, by the way, after the
passing of the new off-shore oil legisla-
tion) that Victoria would be producing
all Australia’s oil requirements within
ten years.
Assuming that Sir Henry continues
to know what he is talking about, the
implications of this for both BHP
shareholders and the economy as a
whole are significant. The current
development plans, which do not in-
clude anything from the partners’ mas-
sive gas resources, could well double
BHP’s profit to $42 million; if these
plans were trebled to 150 million bar-
rels to provide all of Australia’s cur-
rent needs, then BHP’s profit would
more than treble to something like
$132 million even after full tax —if
current oil prices of $3.50 a barrel,
which come up for renegotiation in
1970, were retained. But it is striking,
in the context of Sir Henry’s forecast,
that in ten years’ time local oil con-
sumption will probably be at least
86 million gallons, or 60 percent more
than at present, which would make
BHP’S share price (if it and Esso
remained the major discoverers) look
pretty cheap even at today’s high prices.
For there are the major developments
in natural gas, iron ore, and steel all
added on as extras. Of more immedi-
ate interest are the still-to-be-established
implications of BHP-Esso’s gas dis-
covery off the South Australian coast
last week in their Crayfish well, which
could suggest all sorts of interesting
things for the partners right around the
Victorian coast.
Takeovers
GEC gets AEI
BRITAIN’S BIGGEST-EVER take-
over bid has succeeded; late last week
the board of AEI surrendered, after a
lively battle lasting a month, to the
increased offer from GEC. But it only
did so when it was clear that, despite
their strong resistance to the bid, a
majority of shareholders had favored it.
The victors are not being too rough
with the losers, despite the occasionally
nasty rumors spread about Mr. Arnold
Weinstock, GEC’s dynamic managing
director. For in general this was a pretty
clean fight that showed takeover tech-
niques at their best. Anyway, one result
of the GEC win is that AEl’s chair-
man, Sir Joseph Latham, who master-
minded AEl’s spirited defence, has been
invited (along with two of his associ-
ates) to join the GEC board. And there
is little doubt that there will be a lot
more integration and rationalising (a
nice word for hatchet-work) to come
as the two groups get together. What
this will mean for AEl’s extensive Aus-
tralian operations is yet to be dis-
covered; under chairman R. B. Raines,
the Australian end has been steadily
recovering in recent years from the dis-
astrous muddle he inherited, a pattern
that roughly reflects the British situa-
tion.
As a result of GEC’s win, Britain now
has an electrical group that ranks after
Dutch Philips and the German Siemens
group in Europe, closely followed by
the recently enlarged English Electric.
The sale of AEl’s turbo-generator inter-
ests to English Electric is now a cer-
tainty. Almost as certain is some sort
of deal between the merged group and
C. A. Parsons on large transformers.
GEC’s victory means that AEl’s deal
with Standard Telephones will be off,
thus giving Britain two telecommunica-
tions groups sharing 80 percent of the
market for telephone exchange equip-
ment about equally. But GEC would
be foolish to try to undo the sale of
half of AEl’s 33 percent holding in
British Lighting to Thorn.
Tactically, AEl’s defence was strong:
it frightened the GEC into offering an
extra 5/- share last week, after a
previous “final offer,” an increase which
weakened Mr. Weinstock’s image as a
man of iron who calls his price and
then sticks to it. In the last resort, AEI
failed not because of any weaknesses
in its defence but because of the
incubus of its past. The bulk of its
shareholders have had enough of bright
promises.
Despite the consequent mini-revolu-
tion in AEl’s top management, the
contrast with Mr. Weinstock’s record
of performance was too convincing.
The lessons for the future are obvious:
defending a bid is not as easy as some
had begun to think. And when a com-
pany repeatedly disappoints its share-
holders, they remember, and the harvest
will be reaped - perhaps by the next
generation of managers.
Development
Forgotten railway
THERE WAS A GREAT spate of
announcements of developmental pro-
jects in October and it is therefore
surprising that one long-considered
scheme did not get the green light.
That is the standardisation of the 150-
mile rail line between Port Pirie and
Adelaide. South Australians have ex-
ceedingly good arguments for an im-
mediate start on this project, so that
it can be completed at the same time
as the Kalgoorlie-Perth and Port Pirie-
Broken Hill sections.
The track would serve a variety of
purposes. The most important is that
it would provide a modern rail service
between N.S.W. and the industrial
centres of South Australia. Sheet steel
from Wollongong could more cheaply
be brought to the car and refrigerator

works in Adelaide, and the completed
goods more cheaply transported to
markets in N.S.W. and Queensland. It
would also cheapen transport costs be-
tween Adelaide and Perth, giving South
Australia a fairer go in competing with
N.S.W. in western markets. In addition
it would improve the economics of
Central Australia through providing a
better transport service up toward Alice
Springs and eliminate the change of
gauge between Adelaide and Broken
Hill.
The scheme is a cheap one by any
standards: s3m. is the estimate. Against
the ssom. being spent on the W.A.
standardisation, this is chicken feed and
it is certain that a cost-benefit analysis
would show that it is far more profit-
able for the nation. By any measure,
also, the South Australian economy
needs a boost now. Unemployment is
at a far higher level than anywhere
in Australia. By holding back on pro-
jects of this sort while doling out huge
amounts to W.A. and Queensland, the
Federal Government appears to be in-
dulging in harmful and unfair political
discrimination.
Immigration
'Settler departures'
THE LATEST IMMIGRATION
figures show a further rise in settler de-
partures or, in less technical language,
migrants going home. In the month of
August, for instance, 3225 left as against
12,159 arriving. That is almost a
quarter.
Cf course such a figure does not
mean a great deal. For one thing, look-
ing back over previous months it looks
higher than average. Most months this
year it has been below 2000 returning,
compared to 10,000 or 11,000 arriving.
But combined with 2000 or so Aus-
tralians who leave each month not to
return, there is a substantial subtraction
from our population growth from these
sources.
The Immigration Department com-
missioned surveys on the causes of re-
turn migration, the report of which was
published a fortnight ago. It gave the
proportion of returning migrants as be-
tween nine and 16 percent. The com-
mittee, as reported last week, said it
did not consider the figures unduly
high. It recommended a number of
measures to improve our ability to hold
migrants, and it is likely that these will
be implemented quickly. Mr. Snedden
is a Minister with an unexcelled reputa-
tion for administrative thoroughness and
hustle.
The real questions are whether the
Government has a broad enough view
of what is needed. If its concern is to
maintain a steady growth in the work-
ing population of the country, then it
is high time that the old method of
setting targets in terms of settler
arrivals—is replaced by the more rele-
Returning migrants... why?
vant net figure of permanent and long-
term movement. By sticking to the gross
arrival statistic, the Government gives
the impression that the population is
gaining as much as ever from migration.
In truth, with more Australians going
overseas and more migrants leaving, we
need a very much larger immigration
program if we are to grow as fast as we
were used to in the 19505.
The other question is whether the
Government realises the breadth of
policies required over the long-term in
order to maintain our population
growth. A number of people will prob-
ably always come here because of our
sunshine, but quite basic also will be
our relative standard of living. In the
final analysis this is going to depend
on our industrial and managerial effic-
iency, for our mineral and agricultural
resources are a sort of fixed bonus. The
evidence is that we are, for a variety of
reasons, not doing nearly well enough
in this respect.
Pharmacists
Shares for a Soul
THE LONGER IT takes the Sydney-
based, 42-store chemist chain of Wash-
ington H. Soul Pattinson & Co. to win
its struggle to change the Pharmacy
Act so it can open more chemist shops,
the better for the company.
For so long as the company is banned
by the Act from buying more shops,
it is putting its spare money into the
stockmarket and making a killing.
If and when the Act is changed, Soul
Pattinson’s will be much more of a
threat to the small family chemist than
if the company had been allowed to
expand as it liked for the past 30 years.
Because of its remarkable stockmarket
successes, Soul PatQrson’s now has
SI2J million to spend on expansion

The forward look
Australia is a nation on the move
with vast new industrial and
mining projects under way
many new land development
schemes in progress new
transport services being planned.
Large scale construction projects
at Shell’s two refineries at
Geelong, Victoria, and Clyde,
New South Wales, keep pace
with progress. They are evidence
of Shell’s “Forward Look” and its
ability to meet an ever-increasing
demand for high quality
petroleum products.

ticularly nickel) boom has been the
main factor in adding an extra $5 mil-
lion in that time to the value of its
shareholdings
.
. f'ts holding of 158,0U0 Western Min-
ing shares soared in value as a result
of the. nickel boom from $BOO,OOO to
$4.2 million and its 160,000 Broken Hill
South shares have jumped from being
worth $430,000 to $BOO,OOO. .
Oil has trebled the value of its
BHP shares to $2.1 million. All could
rise further.
The reason Soul Pattinson’s has had
to expand as an investor instead of as
a chemist is that Pharmacy Acts all
around Australia have banned com-
pany-owned pharmacies since the
“family chemists” won protection in
1936 as a means of preventing a threat-
ened invasion of Britain’s Boots group.
Existing company chains were allowed
t.O remain in business, but not to grow
any larger.
Soul Pattinson’s have been steadily
campaigning against this restriction on
their growth, and they have already
won a promise from the N.S.W. State
Government that they will get the right
to move the location of their shops more
than ten miles, even though they have
not yet been given permission to add to
their chain. The N.S.W. Pharmacy
Guild is violently opposing Soul Pattin-
son’s campaign, claiming that its chain-
store tactics would destroy the service
and status of the “family chemist”; Soul
Pattinson’s reply is that their way
brings lower prices and at least equal
service.
Their case on prices looks unanswer-
able. They claim that not only are the
prices Guild chemists agree to charge
20 percent higher than Soul Pattinson’s
on average but that the Guild near-
monopoly in the past 27 years has
resulted in Australian dispensing
charges being among the highest in the
world. *
The company supports this by com-
paring UK chain-chemist prices of
representative products with those of
N.S.W. Guild chemists. The differences
are remarkable, with 100 aspirin tablets
costing 12J Australian cents in Britain
and 35 cents at Guild prices here (Soul
Pa'ttinson’s, by the way, sells them for
20 cents). British prices for 200
saccharin tablets are 11 cents, against
22 cents here; milk of magnesia is
cents against 36 cents here; Vykmin is
60 cents against $l.lO here; Strepcils are
35 cents against 68 cents here; Kemdex
dental cleanser is 25 cents against 40
cents here; Skol is 26' cents against 35
cents here.
Because Soul Pattinson’s dispensing
fee is 36 cents lower than the Guild
fee, the company does about 10 percent
of the State’s prescriptions, through
only 2 percent of the 2100 chemists’
shops in N.S.W., giving a clear indica-
tion that the public prefers to pay less
rather than go to the Guild chemist.
But the Guild claims that pharmacy
is a highly skilled profession and
therefore should have economic protec-
tion: Soul Pattinson’s reply is that “dis-
pensing” as such is rapidly declining
and that 87 percent of all prescription
lines are now pre-manufactured, so
that all the chemist has to do is either
relabel or repack.
Meanwhile, the N.S.W. Pharmacy
Guild has been doing its case the world
of harm by aggressively instructing its
members to refuse to handle products
of manufacturers who also sell through
chainstores; those on the “Don’t Buy”
list include Bristol Myers, Hudnut,
Beecham, Chesebrough-Ponds, Alberto,
Samuel Taylor, Dippity-do, and
Gillette. And it has also instructed them
not to display nor support (and to sell
only on demand) lines that carry low
profit margins.
The battle of the chemists is now
before N.S.W. Cabinet, which has
appointed a Cabinet sub-committee,
comprising Messrs. Willis, Jago, and
Hughes, to look into the whole argu-
ment. They have had submissions from
both sides, and there seems little doubt
that the Pharmacy Act is in for some
substantial changes.

THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy : BHP-Esso announce that their
Bass Strait offshore fields should be able to satisfy about
one-third of Australia’s crude oil requirements by the end
■of 1970; actual production from Marlin, Kingfish, and
Halibut will start at 10,000 barrels a day in mid-1969
and rise to 135,000 barrels a day.
Following a few weeks’ relative stability for fine types,
wool prices have fallen back.
The trading banks’ approval of new and increased
overdrafts slipped to $26.4m. a week during October,
against $28.5m. in September and an average $29.2m. for
the September quarter.
For the markets: Industrials stepped out quite well
on Australian share markets (in moves mostly narrow);
metals and oils remained actively strong.
Equities in London beat a small retreat, chiefly impelled
by bank and other interest rates ... Wall Street staged a
limited advance without overmuch enthusiasm.
For companies: Oil for the longer term came
assured from BHP-Esso (see “For the economy” above);
drilling news also brought a methane gas strike at Crayfish
A-l, 11 miles offshore from Robe (S.A.).
Ilmenite producer Western Titanium is still contemplat-
ing higher output and sales; within two years new plant
will call for another issue . . . Queensland tin dredger
Ravenshoe suffered a profit drop from $377,508 to $68,285
and a dividend sliced from 32| to 124 percent, mainly due
to working in hard ground . . . The D. K. Ludwig group,
through Clutha Development Pty., has secured an option
over Longreach Oil’s phosphate deposits at Duchess (North
Queensland) . . . New findings “should facilitate” the long-
term plans to operate Broken Hill South’s phosphate area
near Mount Isa . . . Penalised by non-repetitive costs for
new plant, ACF and Shirleys Fertilisers dropped from
$1,186,948 to $816,079 for 1966-67; sales moved higher. .
Retailer investors were dashed when ,Myer Emporium
affirmed a decision not to make a public share issue “of
any kind” at present.
Beer may be temporarily in drought, but not Tooth’s
dividend: the interim 8£ percent suggests a 16J percent rate,
its highest level; current trading is apparently “satisfactory”
. . . That’s also the operative word for W.A.’s Swan
Brewery, accompanied by news of higher earnings ... To
climax all this, Carlton and United Breweries sent profits up
5 percent to $7,477,979 and held 13 percent ... On a
softer plane, Schweppes (Australia) has acquired N.S.W.
aerated waters maker Lambton Holdings by cash and shares
... No soft centres for James Stedman, which will secure
Hoadley’s with an increased bid; the rival Life Savers does
not intend to raise its offer.
Heavy engineer Clyde Industries just covers a steady 15
percent on profits down from $1,377,224 to $1,290,807 . . .
Protesting shareholders of Concrete Industries could not
agree to form an “action committee.”
Some time next year is to see a share issue from
Associated Pulp and Paper Mills; meanwhile, the first quarter
of the current year has yielded much higher profit.
Motor parts manufacturer Bradley Bros, jumped earnings
by 51 percent to $153,896 and dividend from 8 to 10 per-
cent, overcoming “intense competition” . . . Profits of
British Motor Corporation (Aust.) slid down 61 percent to
$806,703 as its market share went from 11.9 to 11.6 percent.
MEN AND MATTERS
PROWESS IN FINANCE and wood-
working would seem to go together,
at least in the case of two of our lead-
ing financial experts Sir Roland
Wilson in the public corporation sphere
and Mr. R. H. Harding, the 50-year-old
Adelaide-born investment manager of
CRA in the private one. When both
these men are done with their figuring
for the day, as often as not they go
straight to the carpenter’s bench. Un-
like Wilson, though, Harding also
warms to the public rostrum. Recently
at the Assembly Hall he set off a flurry
of selling in the Melbourne mining mar-
ket when he warned investors of pos-
sible pitfalls in mining investment.
Harding reached his lofty perch at
95 Collins Street in a roundabout
climb that started in a technical school
in Adelaide. His first job was on the
lower rungs of the South Australian
Harbor Board, where spare-time study
got him memberships of the Austra-
lian Society of Accountants, and the
Chartered Institute of Secretaries. The
Army claimed him for five years and
when the Japs had had enough in New
Guinea his unit set about the task of
economic rehabilitation there. Back
home, he soon quit the Harbor Board
and, taking the trip to Port Pirie, he
stayed there for ten years as Broken
Hill Associated Smelters’ cost account-
ant.
In 1957, Rio Tinto’s finance and
other explorations attracted him away
from there. When Rio Tinto merged
with Consolidated Zinc in 1962 to
become CRA, he was already well
versed in examining the economic feasi-
bility of new developments. Mr. Hard-
ing, whose one directorship at the
moment is of Mary Kathleen, lives
at Kew with his wife and three
children. His main extra-mural activity
is church work.
JOHN BLAIKLOCK, who has been
having quite a battle one way or
another as chairman of controversial
Concrete Industries (Monier) Ltd.,
seems resigned to it. He has been in
quite a resigning mood lately (although
he is determined to stick things out at
Concrete for a few years yet, despite
reports to the contrary). Already he
has left the Realty Development and
Mortgage board and has departed from
Development Finance Corporation. And
last week he stood down as chairman
of PGH Industries, although he is to
remain on the board of this business in
which he has a large stake and that he
played such a major role in building up.
after moving into what was then a
company with assets af about $32,000
and “hardly a feather to fly with” after
the war.
For, at 56, there are lots of things
he wants to do; he has a 550—acre
property near Tamworth that he has
J. W. Blaiklock
R. H. Harding
seen only twice this year, for instance.
And he still has other directorates keep-
ing him busy.
A Brisbane Grammar boy (his
family had moved from Tuncurry when
John was 18 months), he married 31
years ago the daughter of Maxwell
Porter (the P of PGH) after his sister
had married Porter’s son (which makes
for all sorts of remarkable relation-
ships). The Blaiklocks had the Porter
tile franchise in Brisbane, but John
moved down to Sydney to rejuvenate
the Porter business (after spending the
war in the Army) and met John Marks
a year or two later; in a few years his
company was ready to float publically,
giving Marks’ friends at Patrick and
Co. their first float. But Blaiklock does
not appear now to be as close to the
DFC group as he was a few years ago;
nor, for that matter, is Patrick and Co.


THE
CROESUS
TOUCH
Monetary policy
during the
reign of Coombs
BY J. C. HORSFALL
IF, UNTIL LATE in his 20 years or
so there, Dr. H. C. Coombs seldom
seemed to be trying to lay Sir Robert
Gibson’s controversial ghost in Martin
Place, he almost succeeded in the end
by coming to agreeable terms with
Treasury and trading banks alike in
the administration of monetary policy,
something Sir Robert, whose clashes
with the likes of Theodore and David-
son were classic, never did. It was left
to Coombs to finish the work Sir
Robert began in forging a truly cen-
tral bank from the politically tainted
bits and pieces of the constitutionally
contrived Commonwealth Bank of
Australia. However much controversial
domestic dust he raised in the ad-
ministration of monetary policy, and
in his relations with the private bank-
ers, he did this so effectively that he
leaves the governorship of the Reserve
Bank with the highest stature in world
central bank circles.
Recently, so I have been told, Dr.
Coombs has been referring to himself
as an economist in the past tense,
something that’s bound to happen to
the best and the worst of the breed, I
suppose. But when Coombs came to
the governorship of the bank after the
war (his yas strictly a Chifley appoint-
ment) he was certainly one of our
most outstanding economists, albeit with
strong socialist predilections. The whole
tenor of Australia’s domestic economic
arrangements at that time must have
been very much to his liking, what
with Government war-time controls
lingering on and the price mechanism,
especially that relating to the price of
money, still somewhat in abeyance.
What is more, Coombs was one of those
most anxious to keep the price mechan-
ism in its restricted role in the deter-
mination of the demand and supply
of money and of much else in the eco-
nomic spectrum.
When Australia voted against the
continuation of war-time controls and
in 1949 made the appropriate political
adjustments, Coombs was at the cross-
roads. It was a tribute both to him
and to the new Prime Minister
(Menzies) that there was no change
in the governorship. To a lot of people,
of course, it seemed a miracle, what
with the nationalisation of banking
being the key issue at the 1949 election
which put Chifley out and Menzies in.
Even so, Coombs couldn’t be expected
to scrap all his dearest economic
thoughts overnight, and I guess the ones
he harbored the longest were on the
theory of money, because not until two
big booms (1950 and 1960) and a little
one (1956) had come and gone were
interest rates brought into noticeable
effect in monetary management and for
the first time in Australia.
It seems open to doubt even now
whether Coombs is really a convert to
the idea of flexible interest rates. It
could be more that, going on his flirta-
tion with them in 1963-65, he has de-
cided he likes his old love of quantita-
tive regulating monetary devices such
as the SRD arrangement and the
periodic word in the ears of the trading
bankers best. He has certainly kept
interest rates out of the picture of
monetary management in the past two
years, when they could well have been
used to elicit some stimulation to busi-
ness activity in the latter half of 1965
(and so saved us the economic stagna-
tion of 1966) and, say, toward the
middle of this year, when a stiffening
of interest rates would seem to me to
have been appropriate to avert what
currently looks to be an unhealthy
burgeoning of activity with attendant
ominous price rises.
The fact that Coombs has neglected
interest-rate changes in these two
instances may stem from a variety of
reasons, besides what is probably a basic
conviction that quantitative devices can
do the job of monetary regulation
better in Australia, where there is not
a sensitive interest rate such as those in
many overseas countries like Britain, the
United States, France, West Germany,
and so on to which the whole
interest rate concertina makes a har-
monious response as if by a touch of
magic. One of these reasons could be
that bank interest rates, which were
the main line of control in his 1963-65
use of interest rates, do not govern the
tempo of credit creation in this country
to nearly the same extent as overdraft
limit arrangements. Doubtless they
could if periodic changes in interest
rates could be made drastic and subtle
enough, as happens, say, in Britain.
(When bank rate is increased by, say,
2 percent there, as it sometimes is, the
cost of bank credit rises correspond-
ingly. Here bank interest rates are very
rarely moved more than a fraction of
1 percent either way.)
Another reason is that interest rate
changes for monetary policy purposes
here cannot be considered in isolation
to the Federal Government’s appetite
for loan money, to which they have be-
come virtually slaves. For instance, in
the second half of 1965, when Coombs
could well have been thinking of easing
interest rates for monetary policy pur-
poses, the Federal Treasury, bewailing
the paucity of money being subscribed
for the short end tranches of its loans,
may well have stood on its high (and
decisive) horse. Again, as Coombs is
probably as much aware of as anybody,
open market operations to effect
changes in some official interest rates
have to be'carried out in much thinner
bond markets than in most overseas
countries, where interest rate adjust-
ments are brought more into the mone-
tary policy play.
Against that, however, the growth
of the short-term money market has
helped to thicken up the bond market
here considerably. This is something to
which Coombs has contributed, or at
least assented, though he has never,
especially in its earlier days, let this
market have its head.
Coombs’ support for an official com-
mercial bill market was given (some-
what reluctantly) in the hope that
this, too, would foster a more intimate
relationship between the money mar-
kets and the monetary authorities. The
move could, in fact, have been a bit
premature (as Coombs thought), be-
cause the market itself hasn’t devel-
oped as much as might have been ex-
pected by enthusiasts, or at any rate
to an extent where it has made notice-
able inroads on inter-company borrow-
ing and the traditional trade of the
banks in bills.
The widest area of the money market
to frustrate Coombs over his long term
of office has been the activities of the
so-called fringe financiers, which made
a laughing stock of official monetary
policy during the 1960 boom and, de-
spite some ill-fated attempts like, say,
the tax on interest, have never been
brought quite to heel since. The fringe
financiers were the sharpest thorn in
the flesh of monetary policy through-
out Coombs’ tenure of office, diluting
the full effectiveness of quantitative
measures and interest changes alike. In
the end, failing the appropriate changes
being effected in the Constitution to
bring their activities under the direct
control of the authorities, Coombs
played the last card in his pack against
them when last year he gave the banks
a new charter of freedom in competi-
tive lending fields. This was a belated
recognition on his part of the view that,
if they had a greater proportion of the
country’s credit business, the fact that
they are under official control would
mean that monetary policy could be
made more effective in the system as a
whole.
The validity of .this proposition has
yet to be established, but Coombs’
espousal of it meant that, in the end,
the man who for so long was so nasty
to the private trading banks finished up
by being their friend. Their most
fervent wish on his departure could well
be that the new governor, Mr. J. D.
Phillips, will keep serving the latest
vintage Coombs, fortified with an extra
dash of interest rate flexibility, perhaps.


ELDER SMITH
GOLDSBOROUGH MORT LIMITED
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS
Tuesday, 7th November, 1967
ADDRESS BY THE CHAIRMAN, MR. H. N. GILES, O.B.E.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The financial year which ended on
30th June last was a good one for the
Company, and its Shareholders. Your
Directors were pleased to increase the
rate of dividend.
This might have been done in an
earlier year, following the successful
merger which brought the present Com-
pany into being, but the serious drought
of 1965 and 1966, in N.S.W. and
■Queensland, intervened. This necessitated
caution, as it was not thought wise to
make an increase until there was reason-
able confidence that it could be main-
tained, even in an adverse season such
as we are now experiencing.
Last year you were told of the im-
pact of the Eastern States’ drought on
our results for 1965-66, but, even at
that time, it was possible to indicate
brighter prospects ahead for the 1966-67
year.
The outlook ahead is not nearly as
happy a one. Not only are livestock
values substantially down, and the wool
market at a disturbingly low level, but,
once again, we are reminded of the
effect that adverse seasons can have on
our business.
Speaking generally, conditions are
reasonably satisfactory in W.A., and over
quite a large area of N.S.W. and Queens-
land. On the other hand, the reverse is
the case—and to a very serious extent
—in the areas of greatest rural produc-
tion in S.A. and Victoria, and in im-
portant areas of Southern and Western
N.S.W. September and October were
both bad months for crops and pasture
alike, even in those areas where, pre-
viously, the prospect had been good.
The, seriousness of the season cannot
be taken lightly. It means that Aus-
tralia’s harvest will be over 200,000,000
bushels less than last year and, up to
50,000,000 sheep and cattle in S.A.,
Victoria, and Southern and Western
N.S.W. could be in jeopardy to a vary-
ing degree.
Diversified though your Company’s
business may be—both in its activities
and its geographical spread its finan-
cial results reflect the fluctuating fortunes
of its primary-producer clients.
As their affairs are affected, for better
or for worse, by world commodity prices,
seasons and any cost-price squeeze, so
inevitably are ours, and, on present in-
dications, we would be more than opti-
mistic if we were to predict that the
current financial year could aproach the
excellent result of 1966-67.
The Directors’ Report will already
have informed you on all aspects of the
Company’s affairs.
HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE
ACCOUNTS
Our turnover, at $565,590,000, was
$24,575,000 (4.3%) higher than the
previous year, but still short of our
record $571,270,000.
Shareholders’ Funds and Special Pro-
visions now stand at $73,010,974 —an
increase of $3,764,698 for the year. You
will see, therefore, that the Company
owns all its Fixed Assets, Investments,
Merchandise, and other Stocks and Live-
stock (totalling $44,817,053); it still then
has $33,714,488 (including the provision
of $5,520,567) to cover all its Trade
Debtors and Bills Receivable, and, also
a substantial percentage of the advances
made to its rural clients.
Reserves increased by $2,366,072 to
$49,099,282, Special Provisions by
$1,525,000, and provision for deprecia-
tion of fixed assets by $2,001,099 to
$17,434,635.
Once again, we have experienced ex-
treme pressure for advances from our
clients, and these reached a record peak.
This accounted largely for the increase
of $13,676,485 to $95,425,611 in our
outstandings. Periods of financial pres-
sure, in the rural sector, appear to be
recurring with disturbing frequency.
Current Assets at $129,262,124 pro-
vide a wide margin of $56,704,477 over
Current Liabilities and Provisions of
$72,557,647. As to liquidity, Short-Term
Deposits and Australian Public Securities
at 30th June, totalled $28,329,154.
Allowances for depreciation increased
by $519,403 on the previous year’s
figure, provisions for merchandise stocks
and certain types of non-profit-making in-
dustry investments by $742,119, and,
for debtors, by $124,807.
Appropriations to Revenue Reserves
from the after-tax profit were $597,606
less than the previous year. On the
other hand, we appropriated $1,525,000
to a new account styled Special Pro-
visions.
Profit (after tax), at $5,988,226, repre-
sents 24.95 percent on the present capital
of $24,000,000, but, when related to
Shareholders’ Funds and Special Pro-
visions of $73,010,974, it represents a
return of only 8.2 percent.
In our industry, a huge volume of
business must be transacted to gain a
reasonable return on the substan-
tial funds employed. Turnover was
$565,590,000 and profit $5,988,226
in other words, 1.06 percent on turn-
over.
I quote these percentages, firstly, be-
cause they reveal the low profit margins
on which we work, and, secondly, be-
cause of a tendency, in some unthink-
ing quarters, to criticise large profits
from large companies.
The criticism invariaby relates the
profits to Issued Capital. It seldom takes
into account the extent to which profits
have been ploughed back into the en-
terprise.
Inflation reduces the value of money
and increases the cost of asset replace-
ment, not to mention the ability to meet
increasing financial needs of clients, on
whose support a business like ours
depends.
„ RURAL FINANCE
It was only twelve months ago that
Sir Philip Mcßride, when addressing
you, expressed relief that the pressures
on us by clients for advances, had eased
from the experience of 1964-65, which
had followed so closely on a similar
experience in 1959-60.
The relief proved to be only tem-
porary. At 30th June, 1960, rural
advances by all Pastoral Houses reached
the then record peak of $203,900,000.
Five years later, in 1965, a year of
further intensified demand, they had
increased by $55,000,000 to
$258,900,000, having risen by
$45,200,000 of this during the preceding
two years.
Following our Meeting last year, fur-
ther pressure in demand began to
emerge. This has continued, and, at
30th June, 1967, a new peak was reached
at $285,500,000 535,600,000 of the
increase during the last twelve months.
I might add that at 30th September,
1967, the last figures available, the
total had climbed to $302,500,000.
Drought conditions had bearing on
the 1964-65 experience, and improved
wool prices, recovery from drought and
prospect of a bountiful harvest all
played a part in easing the pressure
during the 1966 year.
In the year under review, however,
the financing of recovery from drought,
with its consequent effect on stock
prices, and renewed development activ-
ity, brought about the further sharp
step-up in demand for advances.
The question of rural finance has now
become serious, once again. In the seven
years from 30th June, 1960, to the same
date in 1967, rural advances by Pas-
toral Houses have increased by no less
than $81,600,000 from $203,900,000
to $285,500,000.
Obviously, the Pastoral Houses cannot
retain sufficient of their profits to meet
increased calls of this magnitude.
Generally speaking, the profit rate of
many of them does not encourage the
issue of further capital which they would
have to service, and, obviously, there
must be a reasonable limit to the extent
to which they can borrow, or expect aid
from the Trading Banks by way of essen-
tial overdraft assistance.
In present circumstances, it is inevi-
table that rural progress will slow down,
despite the individual need for growers


to increase production on their developed
land to counter rising costs, and the
national need to continue to develop
millio.ns of acres of, as yet, unimproved
land, to increase export income.
Today’s problem combines the cost-
price squeeze, resulting from increased
costs funder most headings, but very
importantly for fertilisers) and the serious
fall in wool values. To this can be added
the fact that, in S.A., Victoria and a big
part of N.S.W., the harvest and seasonal
outlook is bad.
It has been stated officially that Aus-
tralia could need export income of some
SSOOO-million by the mid-19705, to meet
our requirement for overseas funds. With
the season as it is presently heading, we
will be lucky if we exceed S3OOO million
in the current year. Although our over-
seas funds will benefit from proceeds of
sold, but as yet undelivered, wheat from
last year’s record harvest, the impact
will certainly be considerable in the
1968-69 year.
Admittedly, Nature has been good to
us, in other respects. Each year, we have
been able to pull unexpected rabbits out
of the hat to help us—coal, iron ore,
bauxite, nickel, oil, natural gas, and
phosphate, to name some of them.
Obviously, these will add substantially
to our export income and, to an increas-
ing extent, in the years ahead. Others
will save substantially in imports.
Nevertheless, none of these benefits
will remove the major extent of our
reliance, for export income, on rural
primary products.
RURAL DEVELOPMENT
Australia’s exports have benefited sub-
stantially from the extent of increased
rural development in recent years.
Despite the incidence of drought,
there has been sufficient inducement for
many to develop new land, and sufficient
need for others to increase productivity
from what they had already developed.
Until the past year, costs had been
under reasonable control. Overseas wheat
and meat markets are good. Additionally,
overseas buyers, principally from U.S.A.
and U.K., have shown increasing in-
terest in rural investment, especially in
W.A. and Queensland, and have been
able to bring in funds for the develop-
ment of the lands which they have been
acquiring.
During the past year, development
received further impetus, despite in-
creased costs, from good wool prices,
a record wheat harvest, and institutional
entry into the rural investment field.
There were grounds for satisfaction
in the manner in which our livestock
population began to recover from the
N.S.W. and Queensland drought. In
12 months, Australia’s sheep numbers
picked up 6,845,000 of the 13,b00,000
lost in the drought, and cattle numbers
314,000 of the 880,000 of drought losses,
while pig numbers reached a record
figure at 1,813,000 head.
This degree of recovery would not
have been possible had it not been for
our rate of development, for the losses
in the two drought States were not made
good in those States, but principally in
those other States which had not then
been affected by drought and which were
developing substantially.
We now face another set-back. Sea-
sonal conditions have been such that
the harvest estimate has had to be so
drastically reduced (despite more than
a million extra acres sown); wool prices,
though, steady, are too low; and there
threatens to be a water shortage and an
inadequacy of conserved fodder on the
widespread drought areas during the
months ahead. A very substantial de-
crease in growers’ income from wool,
wheat and meat is clearly inevitable.
The tremendous part which the use
of fertiliser plays in Australia’s rural
development and production, cannot be
under-estimated, nor can the fact that
the cost of it has been rising unpleas-
antly fast, due to the considerable
increase in the landed cost of essential
imported raw materials.
While other costs have also been
rising sharply, increases in the price of
superphosphate, principally for the rea-
sons mentioned, have completely eroded
the benefit, and production inducement,
which the existing bounty aimed to
provide. At the same time, wool prices
and drought have seriously reduced
rural incomes for so many.
We fear that this will materially re-
duce the usage of fertiliser in the current
year, with consequent future effect on
rural development, production and pur-
chasing power.
The experience of 1964 and 1965 in
Queensland and N.S.W., and that in
S.A., N.S.W. and Victoria this year,
highlights the very real need for greater
Government encouragement of increased
rural investment in the conservation of
water and fodder, both of which aspects
will become progressively more urgent
during the summer months.
Serious thought must surely now be
given to revision of the existing super-
phosphate bounty, if we are to hope
for the increased export income from
rural primaries that Australia will so
clearly need.
The Government is to be commended
for its taxation encouragement of in-
creased sub-divisional fencing. This will
certainly assist in increasing rural meat
and wool production and exports under
normal seasonal conditions.
RISING COSTS
I have already referred to the fact
that most of our clients, certainly those
who cannot grow wheat with reasonable
reliability, are today suffering from a
severe cost-price squeeze, resulting
from increased costs of goods, service
and fertilisers, on the one hand, and low
wool prices, on the other. This, of course,
is quite apart from the impact on crops,
pastures and livestock income, of adverse
seasonal conditions, as they vary in
intensity from State to State.
So, too, are we experiencing similar
problems in our own business. Salary
and wages costs increased by $1,160,697,
property charges by $569,537, and
general operating expenses, under almost
every cost heading, by $682,415.
Increased levies by State Governments,
a full year’s impact of a new award in
our Industry, the $2 basic wage increase
by the Arbitration Court, and its addi-
tional $1 interim margins impost which
followed, were primarily responsible for
the substantial increase.
The sound and thoughtful submission
to the Court by the Federal Government
doubtless played a part in restricting the
interim margins award to sl, and in
delaying further consideration of margins
for at least many months.
The Government submission highlights
an important point. After all, the
Government is responsible for the
economic management of the Nation’s
affairs, and, for that reason alone, is
entitled to have some say in matters
which can have such major effect on its
ability to carry out that management.
Awards by the Court were consider-
able, over a period of little more than
twelve months, but it was at least some
comfort that the point appeared to be
conceded that, in future, wage increases
should not exceed gains in productivity
—an important aspect, if we are to
maintain our competitive position in
world markets.
What is needed is a reasonable period
of cost-stability ahead. Increases by the
Postmaster-General’s Department, and by
State Governments with stamp duties
and other levies, with a general rising
trend in most other costs, will inevitably
add materially to our own expenses, in
the current year.
INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH
AND DEVELOPMENT
Whilst appreciating the acknowledg-
ment by the Government of the need to-
encourage increased expenditure on in-
dustrial research and development in
Australian industry, in order to reduce
our reliance on overseas technological
progress which dependence means
that we are always behind our overseas
competitors we were disappointed at
the restrictive area covered by the legis-
lation, for it catered solely for manu-
facturing industries.
We realise that rural primary-produ-
cers, as such, are catered for by
C.5.1.R.0. and by the research facilities
of universities and Government Depart-
ments and other bodies in the States,
and that the Government gives sub-
stantial financial aid in these areas.
Also, taxation (including Sales Tax),
Investment Allowance and Export In-
centives have been generously provided
for rural primary-producers and for
manufacturing industries, as encour-
agements to increased production and
export.
We consider, though, that a very
important in fact, essential area
has been completely overlooked.
Between the manufacturing industry
and the primary-producer there lies an
important area of commerce, which
play a big and essential part in export.
This area, and its related costs, bear
on our national ability to produce and
compete on world markets with many
of our biggest export-income earners.
I refer to those essential industries
which service primary-producers in
order to enable their production to take
the final form in which it becomes pos-
sible for it to be exported.
So many primary products must
undergo various forms of handling,
grading, storing, processing, preparing
and packaging, to meet the requirements
of world buyers. This applies in the
wool, fresh fruit, honey, egg and sev-
eral other industries.
Those who perform these essential
services for Australia’s major earners
of overseas funds, are not, themselves,
primary-producers, nor are they manu-
facturers. Nevertheless, they are im-
portant, and the rising costs which
affect them must be passed on, with con-
sequent effect on the cost of production,
and on our ability to produce exports
competitively.
They derive little benefit from sales
tax, and virtually none from income or
payroll tax export or production con-
cessions, or other incentives. Nor, it
seems, are they to be encouraged by
eligibility for research and development
aid.
(Continued next page)


If we reflect on the important need
for these industries to engage in re-
search, in order to provide the most
modern, efficient and cost-saving
methods in carrying out their essential
part a part that new methods of
handling overseas export cargoes now
make even more important - it becomes
evident that serious anomalies and in-
equities exist.
As we see it, there is need for the
broadening of the several areas of exist-
ing legislation which cover sales tax,
depreciation rates, investment allowance,
and, more recently, research and de-
velopment assistance.
CARGO-HANDLING
REVOLUTION
The past year has been an interest-
ing, even though, in some ways, a frus-
trating one—the result of what can only
be termed a revolution in the method
of shipping most of Australia’s imports
and exports, other than those which
move in bulk.
We had all become accustomed to the
first stage of the shipowner’s fight
against rising costs the rapid intro-
duction of huge oil tankers and bulk-
carriers for minerals, and the increasing
use, and size, of bulk-carriers for cereals,
sugar, and other such commodities; and
now, for chemicals.
Simultaneously, rationalisation of ship-
ping programs by members of overseas
“Conferences” held costs by substantial
elimination of costly competitive over-
tonnaging. This reduced significantly the
number of ships required to service Aus-
tralia’s considerable overseas trade.
Important though rationalisation was,
events and change in the Northern
Hemisphere made it evident to ship-
owners, importers, and exporters there,
that even more was necessary. From
this emerged the revolutionry change to
which Australian export and import in-
dustries, and all associated with them,
are now trying to adjust themselves.
I refer, of course, to the introduction
of new Unit Load ships and to the im-
pending entry of Container ships. Firstly,
the Swedes, to be followed, soon, by
the Dutch, introduced new-type Con-
tainer-Unit Load ships into the Aus-
tralian/Europe trade. These quickly re-
vealed an ability to reduce loading and
round-voyage times, with consequent
control of costs.
Hardly were the new-type Swedish
ships in service and the Dutch ones
ordered, when, in a bold announcement,
the nine British shipowners in the Con-
ference advised the formation of two
huge consortia and the fact that they
had lodged orders for nine Cellular Con-
tainer ships, which would commence a
fast and regular, integrated Australian
service early in 1969.
Next followed the announcement that
United States and Japanese shipowners
had also ordered Container ships, these
to operate in Australia’s trade in the
Pacific and with North America.
Just as the bulk-carriers created need
for huge investment in harbours and
loading facilities, so, too, has the intro-
duction of the Container and Unit Load
vessels.
Wool, as Australia’s biggest bulk ex-
port for the new-type ships, will necessi-
tate considerable investment in cen-
tralised near-port facilities for receiving,
sorting, “high-density dumping,” “con-
tainerising” and “unitising,” to meet
the essential need of these new ships.
New port-terminal facilities are
necessary, at which full containers can
be marshalled, and adjacent “break-bulk”
areas where import and export goods of
all kinds can be assembled and, with
exports, packed into containers, ready
for shipment; and, where necessary with
some types of imports, unpacked from
them for delivery.
Costly fast-loading shore-based cranes,
for loading and unloading Container
ships, will add to the considerable in-
vestment so obviously required, as will
the cost of high-density dumps and the
very large number of actual containers
themselves—a substantial percentage of
them to be refrigerated not to men-
tion the cost of the ships themselves.
Harbour authorities face major ex-
penditure to fulfil their new role in the
changing era, as special Container
berths must be provided progressively,
as the volume of cargo, moved in con-
tainers, increases.
The role of many Australian ports
will change, as will methods of trans-
port. Only three ports Sydney, Mel-
bourne and Fremantle will serve the
overseas Container ships. Goods in con-
tainers from all other ports will be fed
to these ports, either by “feeder” sea
services, or by rail or road.
Wool, and many other cargoes, will
be able to move directly, either from the
factory or the terminal, right through
to the mill, factory or warehouse of the
end-buyer on the other side of the
world.
The change brings many complica-
tions in transport, documentation, in-
surance, finance, customs and other
aspects of every-day business. All pose
their legal problems and, as difficult as
any, the problem presented to every
industry engaged in any aspect of
import or export of accepting, and
adjusting to, the inevitability of change
from the traditional methods and pat-
terns to which they have so long been
accustomed.
There is always natural resistance to
change, but the fact of life is that the
change is taking place and rapidly.
Those who are facing the inevitable,
and intellingently planning the neces-
sary adjustments to their operations,
will not be in trouble. Those who are
not, most certainly will be.
The plain fact is Container ships
will be operating early in 1969. There-
after, they will be increasing, both in
number and in the trades in which they
will operate.
There is, therefore, little enough time
available to prepare for the change, so
that our imports and exports can flow
smoothly to and from Australia.
All concerned with the affected
branches of commerce, industry, trans-
port, insurance, banking, customs and
other associated areas of everyday
import-export business, have no alter-
native but to move quickly with the
adjustments, constructions and expen-
ditures which they will need to effect.
WOOL INDUSTRY PROBLEMS
The industry faced many problems
over the past year in fact, it still
faces them.
Despite their decision in the Reserve
Price Plan referendum, grower restless-
ness, uncertainty and dissatisfaction re-
mained.
Although to 30th June price levels
were good, there was wide-spread con-
cern, with costs rising, man-made
fibre prices falling, competition increas-
ing, and more recently, the failure of
the reserve price operations, following
last year’s very heavy “buying-in” of
wool, in New Zealand.
Worries intensified when the 1967/68
selling season opened at a low level.
Although there has since been some
recovery in values, the result of the first
quarter’s selling revealed an average
price decline from 49.28 cents per lb.
last year, to 39.90 cents this year a
fall of 19 percent, or, allowing for an
inferior clip, not less than 17£ percent.
A comparison of values as at October
20 th, in both years, reveals that, in
terms of general averages, Merino wools
were down 5-7£ percent, crossbreds 25
percent and carding wool 17£ percent.
The fall has been greatest with the
broader wools, as the following range
reveals 70’s quality down by 2 per-
cent, 64’s by 4 percent, 60’s by 9 per-
cent, 58’s by 15 percent, 56’s by 23
percent and 50’s by 30 percent.
Grower pressure for a whole-scale
review of all aspects of the marketing
system from the farm to the mill
set heavy tasks for the Wool Board, its
Marketing Committee, two ad hoc Com-
mittees set \p by the Board, Grower
organisations, Wool Brokers, Buyers and
Government Departments.
This culminated, only last week, with
the presentation, to the Australian Wool
Industry Conference, of the Wool
Board’s Report on the Marketing of
the Australian Wool Clip.
To attempt comment in detail at this
stage, on such a wide-ranging four-
volume submission, would be unwise,
for there is much to be analysed before
the possible effects of its full long-term
significance can be calculated.
I am sure that the Industry as a
whole will have derived satisfaction from
the unanimous endorsement that the
auction-selling system is the best means
of distributing the Australian Wool Clip.
Equally, in view of the New Zealand
experience, it was important to note that
the Board, on this occasion, did not
recommend a Reserve Price Plan in the
full sense, because of its view that some-
thing more flexible was required.
There appear to be a number of
aspects, the workability of which is open
to question. However, the Board pro-
poses to confer with grower organisa-
tion in all States, and, also, with other
interested bodies, including wool buyers,
brokers, and bankers. It is hoped that
discussion and negotiation may bring
what appear, at this stage, to be some
essential amendments.
The Board does not appear to oppose
acquisition, the matter which aroused
such strong feeling at the time of the
referendum. In fact, its proposals re-
garding 1,2, and 3 bale lots and price
averaging, actually do mean acquistion,
and to an extent which could cover
almost half the current clip.
Some asDects of the Statutory powers
sought will doubtless figure prominently
in the Board’s discussions with grower
organisations and 4 other interested
bodies, before its final discussions with
the Conference in February.
We sincerely hope that what finally
results will have the greatest possible
degree of endorsement bv all sections of
the industry; that it will be acceptable
to the great majority of Australia’s wool-
growers and, in the final result, will
(Continued next page)


prove to be beneficial to Australia’s
greatest export industry.
Also, during the year, the impending
revolutionary changes in overseas cargo-
handling, already referred to, added
greatly to the problems demanding
immediate consideration.
With all these matters, our General
and State Managements, and their senior
executives, have been heavily engaged,
because of their impact on wool store
needs, new handling methods, industry
study, and likely heavy capital expen-
diture.
The Department of Trade and Indus-
try, believing in the cost-controlling pros-
pect of the Container and Unit Load
ships (particularly the former), has been
untiring in its efforts to focus the full
attention of all sections of commerce
and industry associated with wool, on the
effects of inevitable change, and the
planning necessary for its successful and
economic acceptance.
' As is inevitable, where change is as
widespread and drastic as is presently
indicated, the problem for the wool
industry has been to achieve concerted
and planned examination of the many
problems and proposals, when so many
different bodies, concerned with the many
facets of such a huge industry, are in-
volved.
Containers and Unit Loads create a
necessity for completely new methods,
structures, and machines to receive, sort,
dump and “containerise” or “unitise”
wool cargoes. Inevitably this means
(Advertisement)
heavy new expenditure and costly writ-
ing-down of what could shortly be
obsolete plant.
Increasing the number of bales which
will fit into a container or, perhaps, a
unit load, seems likely to necessitate new
and expensive high-density dumps and
costly scrapping of the old ones.
Dumping to higher density initially
raised overseas buyer resistance, because
of doubt as to the possible effect on the
wool itself, and this necessitated trial
and proof.
Need for ease and speed of access of
sorting and dumping complexes to con-
tainer harbor terminals, adjacent to new
and special berths, raised the natural
query, as to whether these complexes
should not also be located as nearly as
possible to the wool stores and show-
floors.
This, in turn, has brought forward
what has now become well known as
the Wool Village concept, which, at its
logical ultimate conclusion, could imply
the scrapping of most of Australia’s exist-
ing wool stores, and multi-million-dollar
expenditure on new ones.
The aim of all of this is, at least,
to contain or, if possible, reduce the
marketing costs of wool. The problem, to
which the answer is not yet clear is—
could the savings to the industry as a
whole, justify the enormous capital out-
lay likely to be involved ?
If they could, the next question which
follows is—would the savings be shared
equitably by those who would have to
bear the huge financial cost?
APPRECIATION
In their Annual Report, your Direc-
tors expressed their appreciation of the
outstanding efforts of the Management
and Staff, during the past year.
I would like to add to what the Board
has said, by speaking, if I may, on
behalf of you, as the Shareholders, for
I am sure that you, too, appreciate just
how much is owed to them for the year’s
splendid f&sult.
We fortunate in having a Man-
agement Arid Staff, in Head Office, the
States, Ldndon, and the Subsidiary Com-
panies, Who are dedicated to Elders-GM.
They work untiringly, enthusiastically
and efficiently for its advancement. On
your behalf, I pay tribute to their
loyalty and teamwork.
CLIENTS
It has long been the practice of Sir
Philip, and of his predecessors, to con-
clude their addresses with an expression
of appreciation and thanks to the Com-
pany’s Clients. After 45 years of asso-
ciation with them, it is certainly my
wish to maintain this well-set example.
This appreciation I express on behalf
of you, the Shareholders, and, also, on
behalf of the Board, Management, and
Staff, to all those many Clients who have
so loyally supported us during the year.
We look forward to continued associa-
tion with them in the years ahead.
SPECULATOR’S
DIARY
Remember to look
at those
balance sheets
WHAT HAPPENS TO balance sheets
once they’re sent out to shareholders?
Do they go straight into the trash can;
are they given to the kids so they can
cut out the pictures; are they studied in
minute detail, or what? To find out
the answers to these questions an Ameri-
can company put a boomerang card
into their last annual balance sheet
which asked shareholders just what did
go on. Of the company’s 14,000 share-
holders 30 percent replied. The com-
pany was amazed. A considerably lower
reply rate had been anticipated. How-
ever, it was more amazed when it
assembled the information on the cards.
Whereas it had been previously sus-
pected that most shareholders only, if
at all, just skimmed through their re-
port, it was found that, in fact, almost
80 percent of the shareholders took
the matter very seriously and gave their
balance sheets a • thorough going
over. Even more surprising was the
fact that more than 90 percent of
shareholders kept their annual report
so that they could compare it with the
following year’s edition. I wonder if
we’re that conscientious in Australia
(especially our mining shareholders)?
A company whose balance _sheet
obviously hasn’t been properly studied
is Turner Industries. The market is
currently being awfully hard on this
hardware manufacturer, but I don’t
think it will be for much longer. At
today’s price of 30 cents and today’s
asset backing of 74 cents, the company
looks ready to go. Its latest profit result
of $203,000, which was well over one
and a half times that of its previous
year’s effort, seems to have been missed
by the market. So, too, does the fact
that, after three years of abstinence,
the company has returned to the divi-
dend lists with a payment of 4 percent
(covered 2-| times by earnings).
I say missed because it seems to me
that the people who were willing to
pay prices of up to 56 cents, 52 cents,
and 36 cents over the past three years
for the stock would now be breaking
their necks to buy in if they were
aware of the situation. Not only be-
cause the company is again paying
dividends but because last year’s pro-
fit was by far and away the best
recorded since 1963 and, in fact, was
only slightly below the company’s peak
profit of 1962 when its shares were sell-
ing for 89 cents. Another bull point
for this stock is its motor-mower divi-
sion. The latest Government statistics
released for motor-mowers show that
national production was up 15.6 percent
in the September quarter (not at all
bad?). Finally to cap the whole thing
off is the recent directors’ announce-
ment that results for the first quarter
of the current year are better than those
of 1966. The whole situation looks too
good to be true to me. I bought 3000.
My other buy for the week was
James Wallace. I was profitably in and
out of this stock earlier in the year and
now feel that there is leeway once
again for more profit-taking as the stock
struggles to get back to par. At 43 cents
it has 7 cents to go. Although I don’t
expect that this will be achieved over
the next few weeks I feel there is every
chance that it will be over the next few
months.
My selling division has had a vintage
week. I netted a profit of $1056. Ham-
ersley contributed $BB4 and Jaywoth
$172. Incidentally, someone seems to
think that Jaywoth still have quite a
bit in them; he (whoever “he” is) has
taken out a six-month call option for
5000 of them.

Stirring, jazzy times for oil
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON
SUMMERTIME, and the oils are all
running; Crayfish came in and the
charts all point up. Gershwin really fits
the oil market’s jazzy mood. Last week’s
item on this page suggesting that it
was time to get into this market, par-
ticularly now that offshore oil search
was spreading away from Bass Strait,
turned out to be right almost immedi-
ately but for the wrong reason. The
excellent news from BHP on two scores
gas at Crayfish, off the South Aus-
tralian coast, and the development
news from Bass Strait has given an
added boost to the whole market.
The striking thing is that if one of
the two major offshore drills now going
down actually comes up with some-
thing, then last week’s market moves
will be chicken feed compared with
what will come. For the Ashmore Reef,,
well on the continental shelf, but closer
to Timor than to Australia, is in what
the experts claim is one of the most
exciting geological structures now being
searched. Its operator is the Burmah
Oil Co., but Woodside and Mid Eastern
have a stake in it (as do the foreign
oil giants Shell and BP). With Wood-
side looking better every time its Vic-
torian neighbor, BHP, opens its mouth,
and with its own activities taking on a
really interesting appearance, this well
could do a lot for its market status.
Success at Ashmore Reef (so far it
is down to 2375 feet of its 12,500 feet
target) could also rub off on Ampol
Exploration, whose Barrow Island field,
already producing oil, would well be
only one of possibly many fields in tiffs
area off the north-west coast of Western
Australia. And next year the Alliance
group are to put dowm an offshore well
in the Bonaparte Gulf.
On the other side of the continent,
the AOG-Gulf well off Gladstone is
now drilling after last week’s spudding-
in; and then there are all the other on-
shore wells that are going ahead at
present, and that are listed on page
58 of this issue. When, as is inevitable,
most of these turn out to be disappoint-
ments, the market for the operators’
shares will inevitably fall. But these
are stirring times, and for those pre-
pared to run the real risk of loss there
is going to be a lot of money made in
coming weeks, both from the stocks
that have an actual stake in the wells
and those that are nearby. And then
there is always the “sympathetic” run
that the w'hole oil market gets when
really good news sparks investors’
enthusiasm for oil.
THREE PROFIT RISES, a strike in
N.S.W., and a bout of real beer-
drinking weather; it has been quite a
week for the breweries. And since last
month’s rise in beer prices in both
N.S.W. and Western Australia, the
profit outlook for Tooths, Tooheys, and
Swan is getting better and better. Last
week Tooths dividend crept up J per-
cent to indicating a rate of at least
percent for the year, which is con-
fusing the tipsters since Tooths has
always had a bonus issue when the divi-
dend gets up to the 16 percent level
before dropping down again after the
bonus. It could be that Tooths are
playing it safe while waiting to see how
effective the new Tooheys-Millers
brewing combination is before being
kindly to shareholders.
This in itself could be a pretty high
recommendation for Tooheys’ shares;
for it certainly means that Tooths can
no longer do exactly what it likes (or
not do what it dislikes) in the beer
business, forcing Tooheys to follow'
obediently. So Tooheys looks a. good
long-term buy, even if it may not show
any remarkable improvement in the
current year due to integration costs
with Millers’ brewery. But another
excellent brewery proposition is Swan,
which last week reported a profit rise
for the September half-year.
Meanwhile, Carlton and United,
which faces competition soon from the
new Courage group in Victoria, re-
ported a five percent profit rise last
week for 1966-67 following higher sales.
Carlton should not be dismissed as a
brewery investment despite the obvious
appeal of other companies.
EVEN IF Elder Smith-Goldsborough
Mort does not maintain last year’s
31.9 percent earning rate in 1967-68
(and last week the chairman said
it would be “more than optimistic”
to predict that it would even approach
the “excellent” 1966-67 result), the
shares are still good value at current
prices around $2.25. This is only 25
cents higher than the worst price Elders
hit in the depth of the 1965-66
drought. The market has already made
what seems to be more than adequate
provision for the impact of the serious,
but less devastating, drought in' the
southern States on the group’s profits;
the chairman’s comments last week
prompted no further price fall.
There is no doubt about the serious-
ness of the drought; as the chairman
said, it meant a fall in the wheat
harvest of more than 200 million
bushels and that 50 million sheep were
in jeopardy in Victoria, South Austra-
lia, and southern and western N.S.W.
In addition, the bad harvest and sea-
sonal outlook, the cost squeeze, and the
serious fall in wool values were all
having an impact on the company.
The Chartist says:
Long-term holders of MT. ISA MINES LIMITED could soon be well rewarded
for their patience. The technical pdsition of the stock has strengthened considerably
over the past few weeks, and a short-term target of $5.20 is indicated. Once
prices move above the top resistance level of $4.90, targets of $9.00 and $12.00
would be distinct possibilities for the longer term. Mt. Isa now appears ready
to commence a new “growth” phase in terms of market appreciation. Last sale
price on 7/11/67 $4.56.

For Elder’s sales of wool and livestock
make up 70 percent of its turnover.
Elder’s turnover of these two items
dropped 12 percent in 1964-65 when
the big drought and a fall in wool
prices hit the company. But rising sales
from other activities (a point stressed
by Security Analyst in The Bulletin of
November 4, 1967) meant that total
group sales dropped only 4 percent
and profits held up. In fact, the
drought-induced profit downturn in
1965-66 of only 5.7 percent still left
earnings up at 24.4 percent to cover
a 10 percent dividend (that was raised
only last month to 11 percent because
of the company’s confidence in its
ability to maintain the new rate).
Despite the wide cover for the divi-
dend, it may be some time before the
next dividend rise comes, particularly
while there is such a need for retained
profits for use in the business as a re-
sult of pressure from its rural clients
for advances to tide them over the diffi-
cult seasonal situation (a problem that
the chairman deals with at some
length in his address on page 52 of
this issue). But sooner or later, share-
holders must get the benefit of these
retained earnings, which promise to be
far bigger than the dividend payout
once again this year, despite the
drought. The current dividend yield of
almost 5 percent is a satisfactory return
in the meantime.
THERE IS A RIGHT and a wrong
way to go about buying Western
Titanium, the W.A. ilmenite producer
with a very promising future that is now
raising $425,000 in a new issue and a
call on contributing shares to pay for
significant plant expansion and upgrad-
ing which will be followed in about
two years with another major plant
development (and a new issue to pay
for it).
This company (which looks like the
Associated Minerals of ilmenite) faces
an exciting future, not just this year,
as profit should improve sufficiently
following installation of a new wet
separator, but in the long term as well.
But the market is at present pricing the
rights to the current one-for-eight new
issue far too low in relation to the fully
paid shares; while the present price
differential remains, the rights are a
bargain. For the old shares are selling
at $3.75, or about $l.lO above the price
of the rights. Yet the rights, on which
$1 is to be paid (40 cents intially and
the remainder in subsequent calls), not
only allows a buyer, in effect, to pay
off his shares “on terms,” they also
provide cheaper entry. For one-third of
the 98 cents of the 100 cents payable
is deductible for tax purposes and
33 cents of tax deductibility is worth
at least 10 cents to most investors.
There is a moral in this for current
holders of Western Titanium shares; it
is worthwhile to switch out of the fully
paids into the rights, as this means end-
ing up with the same number of shares
but at an effective cost that is 15 cents
or so lower per share.


The defence of South East Asia and
of Australia can only be guaranteed
with the help of the United States
through treaties such as ANZIIS
andSEATO.
Our obligations to these treaties begin in South Vietnam. If we allow South Vietnam
to fall, then Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and before long, Australia, will be listed
for the same fate.
Labor Party policy would result in withdrawing Australian troops from South Viet-
nam, thus alienating our American allies and rendering useless both ANZUS and
SEATO treaties.
Our withdrawal would encourage Communist aggression in South East Asia.
Labor Party policy is to stop the bombing of North Vietnam. Yet that bombing is
necessary to prevent the build-up of enemy troops, arms and ammunition to be
used against our own Australian soldiers!
Don't let Labor’s left-wing extremists gain control of the Senate.

The Melbourne market
Mr. Holt's reaction
to Chrysler
FROM ADELAIDE after the recent
Chrysler opening, a leading Melbourne
broker wasn’t quite happy about the
Prime Minister’s off-the-cuff reaction
to the company’s information that it
proposed to offer the Australian public
entry via the issue of convertible
preference shares. Mr. Holt appeared
to treat this rather more lightly than
somebody avowedly paying more than
lip service to the cause of Australian
equity participation really should when
he said the Government was happy
enough in getting a goodly share of
overseas-owned corporations’ earnings
through taxation. This is not a new
line for Mr. Holt to have taken, but
to look a gift horse like Chrysler in the
mouth with it is hardly the way to
encourage other foreigners to bother
even mildly to appease local predilec-
tions in the matter.
If Mr. Holt seems a pushover for
foreign investors on the question ol
equity participation, the latest say-so in
new issue circles is that the Govern-
ment is going to continue its hard line
on the matter of overseas borrowing in
the local capital market. One hears it
has no present intention, for instance,
of following up Mr. C. T. Looker’s sug-
gestion at the recent Australian United
Corporation meeting that it should
make its guidelines on local borrowing
by overseas corporations operating here
more specific. Nor, according to our in-
formation, are more precise guidelines
deemed appropriate by some under-
writers, who say the “form” for consent
to such borrowing is pretty well known
in underwriting circles, even if consents
to new issues are still very few and far
between. The Government’s point is
that it wants to keep its approach to
approvals flexible. Apparently the last
thing the Treasury wants at this stage
is to put anything down in black and
white.
BROKERS’ CONSCIENCES can’t be
expected to worry them when they put
clients into shares at the top. Not that
this has been happening much in the
Melbourne market lately, when new
tops are being registered from one day
to another all round the place. But
consciences can apparently play the
very devil in finance houses, says a
merchant bank, in advising a company
board whether to recommend share-
holders to accept a takeover offer. It
can happen, as it did recenty when,
albeit approaching the exercise in a
strictly business way, a locally domi-
ciled finance house ends up by having
qualms of conscience after recommend-
ing a board not to accept a bid and
then finding, as inevitably happens in
such instances, all the life go out of a

recently awakened share price and a
lot of shareholders feeling sore at an
opportunity lost.
This case concerned a takeover bid
for a listed public company, which
must here be nameless, in which a
finance house advised the board against
accepting what on the face of it looked
an attractive offer for the shares from
an overseas group, at a price substanti-
ally above that ruling in the market.
The advice was not tendered on altru-
istic or even nationalistic grounds, but
simply *on the prospective merit of the
company which, in the adviser’s
opinion, was not reflected in the bid
price and certainly not in the lowly
market price of the shares before the
offer was announced. As usual the price
of the shares moved up smartly and,
in fact, rose above the bid price on
the expectation that a counter-bid
could well be attracted. When the
board was advised by the finance house
not to recommend the acceptance of
the offer to shareholders and no higher
offer was made for the shares, let alone
a direct approach to shareholders or
a counter-bid, as was to be expected,
the share price slipped back to much
the same level before the original offer
was made as speculators unloaded
their shares and interest in the affair
dissipated. Understandably, some share-
holders, probably a lot more than the
finance house heard about, were indig-
nant that they had been denied the
chance of making a substantial capital
gain on shares which the market had
rated uninteresting before the offer for
them was made.
But if the chance of selling at the
bid price was lost, the offer actually
did shareholders some good, because it
alerted the board to. the company’s
own possibilities (at least in the eyes
of the bidder) and stirred it to greater
efforts on the shareholders’ behalf
even to holding out the bait of a
higher dividend, presumably as an
active appeasement. Even so the con-
science of the finance house was
troubled to the extent of it considering
sending out a letter to shareholders on
its own account explaining the grounds
on which it had made its recommenda-
tion to the board not to accept the
offer. This would have been very nice,
but hardly necessary.
Readers have different views on this
and the matter is certainly arguable
either way. The key point, however,
would seem to relate to what the
market price of any share represents.
In the long run it would be expected
to reflect the worth of the company
as an investment over time. On any
particular day or over a short period
it will reflect demand and supply of
the shares in the market and would
have only an oblique relation to the
intrinsic merits of the company over
time. It could well be that in the long
run, the actual market price of the
shares before the offer was made, and
also the price offered by the overseas
company for them, will both prove to
be below the eventual' worth of the
shares as an investment. Indeed, such
an expectation would, strictly as a mat-
ter of business, be the only grounds on
which the finance house could have
legitimately based its recommendation,
unless, of course, there were side issues
such as family control or such like in-
volved, which in this case was not so.
While it is very touching that the
finance house felt badly that some
shareholders (not those who got in
when the bid was announced or even
a bit in anticipation of it) missed out
on what they believed to be a singular
opportunity, its right course would
seem to stick by its judgment and to let
its conscience rest easy trusting that
the market performance of the shares
and the future returns on them as an
investment will prove the judgment
right.

Behind, the balance sheets
Carrier Air at last emerges
into the clear
AIR-CONDITIONING has been a bit
of a fair-weather industry; it blows
hot and cold with the state of the
economy. But things seem to have
improved considerably in recent times
for Carrier Air Conditioning (Holdings)
Ltd., which may at last have emerged
from the “risky” category it earned for
itself after its 1963 loss and two years
of missed dividends. Now that the head-
long rush to (over) expand has long
since ended and as the company con-
centrates on doing better with more
or less its existing resources, profits
and dividends have been steadily getting
better. They should both continue to
do so.
The likely increase this year over the
latest profit of $395,000 (giving a 19.7
percent earning rate to cover the 10
percent dividend) could well provide
adequate scope for a restoration of the
12£ percent dividend that used to be
paid before the company had its
troubles a few years ago. But the
market is still being cautious about
Carrier. Even though latest prices
around 82 cents (to yield 6.1 percent
on dividends and 12 percent on earn-
ings) are as high as the company’s
share prices have been in 1965 and
1966, its prospects now look far better
than then. In any event, they got as
high as $1.02 last month, and there
seems every prospect of the shares re-
turning to around that level. For the
building industry, which has been sub-
ject to quite violent fluctuations in the
past, and on which the company de-
pends for its prosperity, is showing
signs of becoming much more stable,
But the business is still very corn-
petitive, with the company reporting
that profit margins are very fine (its
profit margin rose from 3.2 percent
to 3.5 percent on sales last year) due
to the substantial increase in the
number of air-conditioning contractors
operating in recent years without a
proportionate increase in work for
them. In this situation, any sudden
downturn in building could have a
significant impact on the industry’s
profits. But Carrier is not nearly as
extended as it was in 1963 and would
not suffer like that again.
An indication in the volume of the
swings in the business is in Common-
wealth production statistics for air-con-
ditioners and coolers, which highlight
the market difficulties which Carrier
has had:
UNITS
1958- 12734
1959- 40065
1960- 68454
1961- 28695
1962- 11373
1963- 8237
1964- 11219
1965- 26264
1966- 36733
A great influx of demand for package
units in 1960-61 put production up to
levels unequalled since. Carrier believes
that many small firms lacking in re-
search and development facilities pro-
duced ineffective and noisy units which
gave air-conditioning a bad name. But
the figures are showing striking im-
provements in output so far this
financial year. Production for July and
August this year is 70 percent above
1966 levels, and producers this summer
expect to have record sales, especially
for window units.
And immediate prospects for the
larger installations also look good, with
Carrier reporting that many projects
that had been postponed are now being
approved. A number of contracts that
the company had expected to get early
last year were not in fact documented
until near its end, so there is plenty of
work on hand. This impression is rein-
forced by latest statistics which show
the value of approvals for commercial
and industrial buildings was up sub-
stantially in September to $91.9m.,
probably a record figure for any month.
So prospects of a further profit im-
provement from last year’s 19.7 percent
earning rate look very strong, particu-
larly in view of the fact that the reason
for Carrier’s fairly good result in 1966-
67 was because of a marked recovery
in the second half of the year after a
“below budget” first half. This second-
half trend is continuing and the com-
pany says that orders at July 1 were at
a very high level. However, it did not
specify a figure for forward orders,
although it had in many previous years.
Sales in the year to June 30, 1967,
were up 14£ percent on the previous
year’s s9.Bm. to $11.2m. and debtors
rose 9 percent. But there was a 33
percent stock buildup which directors
expected to reduce in the current year.
The one-third rise in stocks under-
lines the extent to which the com-
pany’s 1966-67 trading recovery took
place in the second half of the year.
For directors say that the big rise in
stocks was due (in the main) to the
increased activities, which suggests a
very high level of business at the end
of the year, spilling over into the cur-
rent period. This rise in stock means
that the company has lengthened the
time of its average stock turn from 5.6
times a year to 4.8 times. But this rate

“You mean to say you’ve finished all those invoices
already?”
“Yes sir, in one-third the usual time.”
“That Soemtron automatic invoicer really is going

“Not only that, it’s going to eliminate accounting
bottlenecks and make our procedures so simple and

“Imagine, our invoices always out on time.”

could help our Company so much.”

The company produces air-condition-

(N.S.W.) plant, and the sheet metal
work (for ducts) for interstate instal-
lations is done in Moorabbin (Vic.),
Woolloongabba (Qld.), and Somerset

Spiro Duct Pty. Ltd., and its port-
able machine manufactures tubular duct
and pipes for irrigation and other pur-
poses, usually at Seven Hills. Carrier’s
business covers a complete range of
air-conditioners. But presumably the
best profits are to be had in the con-

Security analysis
Burns Philp clearly undervalued
EVEN THOUGH I still do not know
the correct pronunciation for the
second name in Burns Philp and Co.
Ltd.’s title, I am always a little awe-
struck whenever I see the whole title
in print. The most recent Press pub-
licity occurred in mid-October when
it was stated that Burns Philp would
lose the subsidy paid by the Federal
Government for the maintenance of a
shipping service to Papua-New Guinea.
With good judgment, the market seems
to have ignored the situation, for the
share price has hardly moved, and such
movement as can be detected has been
in an upward direction.
The accounts for 1966/7 are not yet
available not even the preliminary
profit figures but it is likely that
when they are published they will show
once again that shipping has been rela-
tively unimportant to Burns Philp. The
subsidy, at $400,000, is about 25 percent
of the amount that was set aside in
1965/6 as “provisions” for property
replacement, docking and repair, and
merchandise stock stabilisation. How-
ever, this amount of $400,000 is
obviously an important component of
the parent company’s “Balance of profit
on trading” figure, which has shown the
following trend in the past five years
(the parent company’s figures for
interest, directors’ and auditors’ fees,
etc., are also given):

Provisions for staff 200 371 275 178 260

(+) 15-mo nth period.
As is well known, these figures are
of little significance when the group
is regarded as a whole. The investment
income of the parent company, for
example, totalled over $2 million in the
fifteen months to June 30, 1966. This
seems a good opportunity to look at
the same series of statistics as we did
in the case of W. R. Carpenter and
which, it may be remembered, were a
little different from the normal stat-
istics for industrial companies.
Two factors can be seen immediately.
Firstly, investment income has been
declining in importance, suggesting that
most of the strong per share earnings
growth of recent years has come from
the group’s other activities. Secondly,
the share price in calendar 1966 never
reached the net tangible asset backing
of the shares, suggesting that there has
been some under-pricing, as it is gener-
ally conceded that the asset valuations
are quite conservative. If the investment
portfolio was included in the balance
sheet at the market valuation at June
30, 1966, the net tangible asset backing
would increase to $5.13 per share.
As at June 30, 1966, the market value
of the investment portfolio stood at
about $41.5 million or at $2.30 per
share. It was showing a return of only

the question whether any company

these surplus profits to the shareholders

that could have been advanced earlier
was that in doing so the shareholders
would have had to pay income tax on
the dividends so received. While the

details of the share register are not
known to me, it is quite conceivable
that many of the shareholders are cor-
porations which would receive the
usual rebate on any dividends received.
It then becomes a question whether the
company is able to invest the funds to
better advantage than the individual
shareholder.
The statistics relative to the invest-
ment portfolio are as follows (1966 be-
ing for a 15-month period ended June
30):

Investments in listed companies
account for nearly 84 percent of the
total book value of the investments at
June 30, 1966, and this is almost pre-
cisely the same percentage as W. R.
Carpenter’s portfolio. The pre-tax
return on the listed investments (which
includes Government and semi-
Government securities) was 5.3 percent
in 1962/3 and fell to 5.05 percent in
1964/5. The fifteen-month period pre-
vents the return being calculated for
1965/6.
So far as the market performance of
the portfolio is concerned, the most
satisfactory measure would be the rela-
tionship of market value to cost at each
balance date. The index of this figure
and the market growth index of Burns
Philp’s shares are as follows, with the
Sydney All Ordinary Index less mining
thrown in for comparison:
As at March 31 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966
(30th June)
Investment portfolio 100 93 104 78 76
Burns Philp shares 100 99 134 125 120
Sydney AO I ex M 100 98 116 100 96
One could hardly regard the market
performance as demonstrating an
investment expertise superior to the
average.
The most recent description (from
an official source) of the group’s activi-
ties was given in the 1964 chairman’s
address. In this address, the chairman
said, “Operations generally cover about
18 different classes of industry . . .”
From his list, there would seem little
doubt that the main activities of Burns
Philp are merchandising. So far as it
is possible to judge, earnings per share
from all activities, excluding the
investment portfolio, doubled from
1961/2 to 1964/5, and it is likely that
there was a further worth-while increase
in 1965/6.
In view of this growth, I would think
that these activities could be valued at
15 times 1965/6 earnings and, on my
estimate, this value would be at least
$3.00 per share. In this event, the
investment portfolio, which had a mar-
ket value of $2.30 at June 30, 1966, is
only being included at 44 percent of
that value or at 12 times its earnings.
There seems to be a clear case of under-
valuing here, unless the 1966/7 figures
show a sharp downturn in profit.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
You will have seen from the
40th Annual Report which has
been distributed to all Stock-
holders that for the year end-
ed 30th June, 1967, the total
profit before tax earned by
Bradford Cotton Mills Limit-
ed and its subsidiaries was
$2,409,623. The printed ac-
counts and financial state-
ments show that the nett pro-
fit after tax for the year was
$1,429,024 which compares
with $1,235,570 for the pre-
vious year, which was itself
an all time record for the
Company.
B
rifc
If you will turn to page 10
of the printed accounts you
will notice a consistent pat-
tern of increased after tax
profits over the last five years
which, I am sure you will
agree, shows a very satisfac-
tory trend.
This year, in which the
Company records its 40th an-
niversary, the final dividend
at the rate of 10% now re-
commended follows consecu-
tive dividend payments of at
least 10% every year for the
32 years since 1935 when
Bradford first became a Pub-
lic Company.
Bradford Cotton Mills
Limited has maintained its
position as a leader in the
Textile Industry by being
prepared to change the na-
ture of the Company to suit
changing market conditions.
Competition demands ever
increasing efficiency and the
application of new tech-
niques. As new fibres and
better plant and processes
have been proved and evalu-
ated w;e have expanded into
one field after another cover-
ing all the main fibres.
Bradford introduced com-
pressive shrinking (Sanforiz-
ing) into Australia; the mer-
cerising of cotton piecegoods;
the continuous dyeing and
rotproofing of cotton textiles,
and many other innovations.
We were also the first Aus-
tralian Company in the tex-
tile field to earn before tax
two million dollars in profits
in a year. For these advance-
ments and the implementa-
tion of Board policy in the
face of what at times seemed
insurmountable difficulties we
can thank our fine team of
executives and technical
staff.
The printed accounts deal
quite fully with the results
and there is no necessity to
do more than comment brief-
ly on some of the more im-
portant figures.
We have maintained a pro-
gressive plant modernisation
programme which has con-
tributed to increased produc-
tivity and, in addition, we
have gained from an overall
increase in the volume of
production.
Sr
The healthy cash flow gen-
erated during the year has
resulted in an improved over-
all balance sheet structure
with greater general liquidity
and a notable increase in
available working capital.
BANK OVERDRAFT
Bank overdrafts which
stood at $5,460,910 at the end
of June, 1966, were reduced
to $3,556,928 by the 30th
June, 1967. Compared with
the previous year stocks have
been reduced by $477,775.
DEBTORS
We have continued to meet
a sustained request for ex-
tended credit by our custom-
ers and, having regard to this
and to the increased turn-
over, it is satisfactory to find
that the increase in debtors
in the year was only
$278,846.
Additions to fixed assets in
the year cost $918,641. These
funds were provided from in-
ternal resources. Additions to
plant accompanied by a
carefully planned mainten-
ance programme, have en-
sured our manufacturing
units being kept in first class
order.
DEPRECIATION
Depreciation charged in
determining the profit for the
year was $1,590,350.
THE FUTURE
We are concerned at devel-
oping competition from State
controlled economies, parti-
cularly Mainland China, and
we have been subjected to
unfair competition from oth-
er sources.
If we are to continue to
operate our plants to their
maximum economic levels,
serious penetration of our
market by overseas manu-
facturers should not be al-
lowed to go unchallenged.
&
I
We appreciate the degree
of co-operation Australia has
received from Japanese


manufacturers in this regard,
but restraint exercised by
them will have little meaning
if the flow of textiles from
other sources is not similarly
restrained.
I have said previously con-
ventional protective measures
have no meaning in this com-
petitive field. The Govern-
ment has been made fully
aware of the situation and
through the Office of Indus-
try in the Department of
Trade some progress has
been and is being made in
watching competitive imports
which could disrupt the Aus-
tralian market.
THE CURRENT YEAR
I am glad to say in spite
of our problems that profits
for each of the months of
July, August and September
are ahead of those for the
corresponding months of last
year, and the total for the
quarter is substantially—and
I mean substantially—in ex-
cess of the 1966 figures for
the same period.
In an industry so greatly
and quickly affected by
changing conditions, it is
prudent to be guarded in
making forecasts, but we can

AUSTRALIAN
RAW COTTON
No report of mine would
be complete without refer-
ence to the part played by
Bradford Cotton Mills Lim-
ited and by the Australian
Cotton Textile Industry in
providing a market for Aus-
tralian grown cotton.
Stockholders will have read
of the quite dramatic expan-
&
&
sion of the cotton crop in the
Namoi Valley in New South
Wales and to a lesser extent
in the Ord River in Western
Australia. In addition there
is the Queensland cotton
crop which has always been
taken up by Australian spin-
ners of cotton yarn.
Bradford Cotton Mills
Limited is the largest single
user of Australian grown cot-
ton and it expects that as its
own share of the market is
allowed to expand it will use
increasing quantities. It is
anticipated that the 1967/68
crop will be of the order of
120,000 bales. To be able to
use this and to continue to
provide cotton growers with
a steady market for their
crops it is necessary for Aus-
tralian spinners and weavers
not only to retain their pre-
sent share of the market but
to continue to expand.
An increased market will
depend partly on the degree
of success within the indus-
try in controlling and reduc-
ing costs of production. It
will come in part from an
understanding and an appre-
ciation by Governments of
the contribution being made
to the Australian economy
by the operation of textile
mills in decentralised areas
which provide worthwhile
jobs and opportunities for
young men and women
where otherwise such oppor-
tunities for work would not
exist.
AMERICA S CUP
In common with most Aus-
tralian people, and many
American citizens too, we
were disappointed that the
“Dame Pattie” did not do
better in the America’s Cup
race. This is understandable.
However, there is no need to
be unduly depressed. Austra-
lian designers, builders, and
those who supplied equip-
ment and fittings, combined
to turn out a splendid yacht
generally conceded to be the
second best twelve metre
boat in the world. The fabric
from which the sails were
made was supplied by Brad-
ford Cotton Mills Limited
and it met all the demands
made of it.

THE BASLE FAIR
This year the great Euro-
pean Textile Fair was held
at Basle. Once in four years
textile machinery manufac-
turers from all over the world
display their wares at this
European Exhibition and
technicians and other textile
representatives come from all
over the world to see it.
The Australian Textile In-
dustry was well represented.
This Company was repre-
sented by several of its lead-
ing technicians and managers
in order to ensure that we
will be well informed in re-
gard to the latest develop-
ments in the types of equip-
ment we use which, I think
you will appreciate, cover a
very wide range.
ORGANISATION
In the printed report you
will see reference to the
changes in the managerial
structure of the Company. In
February of this year at my
request the Board of Direc-
tors accepted my resignation
as Managing Director. At the
same time they invited me to
remain as Chairman of the
Board. As my successor the
Board appointed Mr. Charles
F. McElvenny, General
Manager since 1965 and a
Director of the Company
since November of last year.
I believe that the manage-
ment of Bradford Cotton
Mills Limited in the capable
hands of Mr. McElvenny is
well suited to match the de-
mands of an active and suc-
cessful Company such as
Bradford Cotton Mills Limit-
ed. Mr. McElvenny has play-
ed a major role in shaping
the management structure
and he is supported by a
team of managers, each skil-
led in his particular area of
activity. Bradford Cotton
Mills Limited has developed
a fine team of executives and
mill managers and Stock-
holders generally will share
my satisfaction in this re-
gard.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion I wish to re-
fer to all employees of the
Company, for each in his or
her own sphere has contri-
buted to the very successful
year that we have had and
on behalf of the Stockhold-
ers, the Board of Directors
and myself, I extend to them
our thanks for the contribu-
tion they have made.
»
I now wish to formally
move that the Directors’ Re-
port and the Accounts of the
Company for the year ended
30th June, 1967, be adopted
and I will thank somebody
to second the Resolution so
that the matters may then be
open for discussion. I will be
please to answer any ques-
tions related to the terms
therein.

Mining
Look at Consolidated Rutile
AS DIVIDEND YIELDS from mining
shares creep lower and lower it be-
comes more attractive to look at those
companies which are not yet in the
position of being able to pay dividends,
but which at least have mineral
deposits of commercial size and
grade and which will provide a rea-
sonable yield when full-scale production
is achieved. There are very few such
companies, as most of the non-dividend-
paying ventures are still in the stage of
prospecting for adequate ore reserves;
Consolidated Rutile does meet the cri-
teria of having a commercial deposit
while not yet being at full production.
Compared to many ventures which have
yet to establish an ore body, let alone
any quantity of reserves, Consolidated
Rutile must surely rate a second look.
At its leases on North Stradbroke
Island, 25 miles east of Brisbane at the
mouth of the Brisbane River, the com-
pany has reserves of over a million tons
of rutile and zircon. At September,
1965, the deposit held 600,000 tons of
rutile and 514,000 tons of zircon. Since
that time the company has only ex-
tracted some 20,000 tons of rutile and
15,000 tons of zircon, but part of this
tonnage has been extracted from levels
up to 40 feet below the maximum depth
to which drilling was done when the
original ore reserve figures were calcu-
lated. The Yarraman deposit, where this
occurred, contains about half of the
ore reserves stated in the company’s
prospectus dated September, 1965.
Drilling on this deposit reached a maxi-
mum depth of only 60 feet, and the
whole ore reserve figure for this deposit
is calculated on results obtained from
the top 50 to 60 feet.
The company’s investigating geolo-
gists indicated that deeper drilling
could increase the possible ore reserve
figure, and, indeed, this has been sub-
stantiated by the company’s extraction
of heavy minerals from lower depths.
A program of test drilling has encoun-
tered depositions of heavy minerals of
economic grade extending from 30 to
120 feet in some locations, the chair-
man stated last month.
The deposits of rutile and zircon have
been made by changes in the coastline
as well as wind and ocean movement;
the result of this is that there are several
layers of heavy mineral at various
depths in the dune deposits on the
island. In some of the company’s areas
three such layers have been established,
while it is expected that two more will
be found by deeper drilling. On the
Yarraman deposit only one layer has
as yet been delineated, but further
cycles of concentrated heavy mineral
may be found at depth. It is probably
safe to say that the company’s reserves
will turn out to be at least twice the
figure given in the prospectus two years
ago.
On the score of ore reserves, Consoli-
dated Rutile leaves little doubt: it has
proved some $74 million worth of
rutile and zircon and seems likely to
have as much again. But it is one
thing to own the mineral and quite
another to get it to market. The com-
pany originally planned to extract some
30,000 tons of rutile and an associated
quantity of zircon (about 25;000 tons)
per annum. Due to the unique location
of the deposits, in high dunes rather
than beneath, or at least close to, the
existing sea level, a method of mining
was chosen which had not previously
been in use in similar conditions. While
this has been successful, it suffered at
first from a shortage of trained opera-
tors and did not operate very well
under abnormally wet weather. Trouble
at the company’s dry mill also affected
output of zircon, and for its first year
of mining operations, ended last June,
the company produced only 12,785 tons
of rutile and 9886 tons of zircon
well short of the prospectus estimates
mentioned earlier. However, even
though production was at this low level,
the company earned a profit of $104,000
from mining operations (no tax was
payable) and it appears that it was only
during the last three months of the year
that the break-even point was exceeded.
Production up to that time had
totalled 7828 tons of rutile and 5513
tons of zircon. Since the end of the year
production has continued to improve,
and for the September quarter was at
the rate of 22,212 tons of rutile and
17,500 tons of zircon on an annual
basis.
At this rate there is little doubt that
the company will be well into profit dur-
ing the current six months and will
be able to show' a reasonable profit for
the full year, which, while no doubt far
short of the $1 million-plus estimated
at the time of flotation, will certainly be
enough to commence paying dividends
at a modest rate. Should output con-
tinue to improve, as can be expected to
happen with further adjusment to treat-
ment circuits and added experience,
full-capacity treatment rates could be
achieved by the end of the current
financial year. If this happens, the
current price of the shares is indeed
cheap, but even if the company has
further trouble in achieving capacity
levels of output its continuing drilling
program should provide a base for
present shares prices in the form of
additional reserves which must become
more valuable (and hence more profi-
table to extract) as time goes on and
world supplies of rutile become increas-
ingly scarce.

all walks of life. Yet many otherwise
intelligent people know little of its dan-

over-exertion and unsuitable diet.
Neglect—and reliance on superficial
relief—invites serious medical conse-

Commodities
Other metals influenced by
the copper strike
THE EFFECTS OF the United States
copper strike are not confined to that
metal alone. Silver, for instance, has
been profoundly disturbed in both out-
put and price. Production from Ameri-
can domestic mines for August sank
to 1,785,454 ounces, the smallest for
more than 21 years, and actually
1,925,760 ounces below August, 1966.
As a result of this, the current world
shortage of silver is markedly aggra-
vated. London Metal Exchange prices
have steeply increased since the strike’s
beginning in July, last week adding
■another sd. stg. to reach a peak 168 d.
an ounce. July spot prices had been
around 140 d.
Recent years have seen striking in-
creases in the industrial demand for
.silver and these are accompanied by
relatively small rises in new production.
The great technical improvements in
home cameras have obviously made
photography a much more popular
hobby, so boosting the usage of film;
the electrical and electronic industries
continue to lift their requirements as
well. Silver has therefore been almost
-entirely priced out of the market as a
monetary metal.
In America itself, the Treasury
stopped its sales of silver on July 14;
since 1963 it had been willing to sell
freely in order to keep the price from
moving above SUS 1.2929 an ounce.
.Any higher price for the metal would
have meant that the standard silver
dollar would have become worth more
than its value as money (excluding the
costs of melting). The melting of silver
coins is, however, still banned and new
subsidiary coins contain no silver.
Those moves are designed to provide
more silver for industrial purposes. In
view of tremendous pressures on its
stocks, and the necessity of having some
silver coinage, the US Treasury now
rsells only to bona fide domestic users.
Other countries, notably Australia,
Britain, South Africa, and Canada, are
eliminating silver from their coins.
Australian miners, of course, are
benefiting from the higher prices, as,
for instance, North Broken Hill’s latest
annual report indicated. New produc-
tion is certainly encouraged, but fresh
mine sources are proving difficult to
find. The lofty prices may, from time
to time, flush out speculative holdings
over the world. They may also bring
more substitution. It has even been
suggested that traditional bridal silver
may give way to stainless steel!
THE COPPER STRIKE also looks as
if it .may bring some relief to lead
and zinc. The Lead and Zinc Study
Group had already predicted a surplus
supply position in each metal for this
year and 1968. Now the production of
some 120,000 tons of lead and 138,000
tons of zinc may have to be foregone
by American mines and smelters.
That would not be sufficient to cancel
the anticipated surplus situations, yet
it makes continuance of price support
at about prevailing levels reasonably
assured. Producers possess sizable
stocks and have been holding a fairly
effective floor under them for some
time.
Demand has slackened as a conse-
quence of uncertain economic condi-
tions in major industrial countries. It
is interesting, though, that in Australia
at least the 1967 consumption of zinc
is apparently at much better levels than
in 1966.
AS FOR COPPER itself, local fabri-
cators may have to face a further
increase in the producers’ price, now
standing at $ll5O a ton. Cash prices
on the LME last week put on a net
£stg.23 to finish at £so2£. They had
not been above £5OO for 15 months.
There has naturally been a fair
amount of bear covering in London.
European consumers have also been
buying. A measure of profit-taking
helped to contain the advance.
A LITTLE NERVOUSNESS ensued
when the Geneva discussions on a hope-
ful renewal of the international sugar
agreement ended without any com-
munique. The talks were preliminary
to the complete negotiating conference
proposed for April, 1968.
However, reports agree that the mood
of delegates was reasonably optimistic
and that the April meeting will proceed
as planned. Experts from 22 exporting
and importing countries deliberated for
eight days at Geneva, covering such
matters as export quotas, stocks, and
suggestions on raising sugar consump-
tion.
The recent firming of LME (free
market) prices derives from an expected
drop in supplies available over the
coming months. Both Cuba and the
Philippines are likely to have smaller
crops than previously estimated.
WHAT HAS THE SMELL of rotten
eggs off the south-west coast of Africa

1920 A
finds its way into Australia’s soil
through fertiliser manufacture, being
used to make the sulphuric acid used
In superphosphate production.
Dr. Coghill comes from Omaruru,
where rotten-egg gas (hydrogen sul-
phide) drifts from the sea each year'.
For the past two years he has studied
this phenomenon and finds that the
chemical reaction occurs under desert
sand which has blown some 30 miles
seaward to cover seabed ooze. Here
anaerobes live on inorganic substances,
including gypsum (calcium sulphate,
used for plaster-making). The West is
rich in gypsum, so the jigsaw begins
to fit into place. The microbes reduce
sulphate to sulphides, which hydrolyse
in the water to form hydrogen sulphide.
This gas, every now and then, bursts
through its sand cover and drifts in-
shore. It kills the fish and makes the
locals hold their noses. But to Dr. Cog-
hill, rotten-egg gas has the sweet smell
of success for, after having studied the
natural process, he believes it can be
duplicated commercially in huge sea-
water pits. From 2.5 million tons of 80
percent gypsum, with fertiliser to
trigger the reaction, he plans to pro-
duce commercial hydrogen sulphide
and from this, cleansed with lime, burn
off an initial 100 tons of pure sulphur
daily. The Western Australian business-
men who read of his research and
brought him to Australia plan to set
up a public company on the strength of
what he has done.
The great bulk of the sulphuric acid
made in Australia uses imported ele-
mental sulphur, which is one of the
few important raw Materials not occur-
ring here in economic values. World
expansion of superphosphate production
in recent years has led to a tight supply
position and an equivalent advance in
spot prices. Some improvement in
supply is expected during 1967, but fer-
tiliser demand keeps up a continual
pressure.
IT DOESN’T LOOK as if it will be
any too easy to enforce the new Inter-
national Wheat Agreement when it
actually comes into effect on July 1
next. Even with the Australian crop
shortfall, dealings between now and
then give the appearance of being
something like an open go.
Canada, one of the major growers,
has announced that it will dispose of
wheat on world markets at whatever
price it can get, until July 1. Canadian
farmers are to be paid a floor price
of sCan.l.9s|- a bushel No. 1 Northern
over the period before the agreement
becomes operative.
The Canadian Minister for Trade,
Mr. Robert Winters, has stated that
there is no international gentleman’s
agreement informally to observe the
new agreement’s price marks this
year. The Government has given its
pledge to farmers and “will follow
market prices as they develop.” Foreign
sales would be made under the floor
“if necessary to meet competiton.”
Taken together with Australia’s dire
crop shortfall, it will be interesting to
see the effect of Canada’s exports on
prices. These exports, also, are pre-
dicted to be lower, at between 325 and
350 million bushels, than last year’s 483
million bushels (the forecast excludes
sales to Mainland China). The
Canadians describe the reduced figure
as a “return to more normal wheat
trading conditions.”

The general advance has undoubtedly gained more assurance;
it is far from confined to the major metals and oils. These
latter, of course, took a mighty kick from BHP, which leapt
$1.05 on the week to strike $16.05 at the close—just below a
Friday morning $16.10. Among the lesser lights, AOG put on
20 cents to reach $2.40 and Ampol Exploration finished at
$2.00 after a net 15 cents rise. Great Boulder slipped back 40
cents to $10.50, but there was no lack of mining gains: North
Broken Hill, 24 cents; Mount Isa, 26 cents; CGA, 50 cents;
and CRA, $1.60. Myer drifted down 10 cents.

THE LAND
The sober sides in wool
THERE’S SOMETHING LIKE a
breathless hush over wool as the
various sectors of the industry prepare
to take up their positions on the Aus-
tralian Wool Board’s marketing report.
In view of the ructions last time, it is
rather tempting to talk in terms of
battle positions and so on. Yet, al-
though the coming differences of
opinion will be very real, some signs
are already being given that a few of
the industry’s leaders hope the discus-
sion may take place with a measure
of calm.
No one can read Mr. H. N. Giles’
distinguished chairman’s address to the
Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort annual
meeting (reproduced on pages 52-55
of this issue) without sensing a feeling
of urgency for wool’s problems and a
desire for an unembittered resolution.
“We sincerely hope that what finally
results will have the greatest possible
degree of endorsement by all sections
of the industry,” Mr. Giles says.
Mr. T. B. C. Walker, the president
of the Australian Woolgrowers and
Graziers’ Council, also shares this
mood: “I strongly recommend to grow-
ers to take every reasonable oppor-
tunity to inform themselves, clear up
doubts, and, in an unemotional atmos-
phere (his italics), make their own
assessment.” Mr. Walker naturally
points out that the Wool Board’s mar-
keting committee had a majority of
only one in favor of the report’s rec-
ommendation and urges close study of
both majority and minority reports.
At this very moment not much con-
solation is to be drawn from wool’s
price situation. After some recent
relative firming for finer types, last
week’s sales saw even these give ground,
while crossbreds continued to droop
heavily. The rise in the U.K. bank rate
certainly won’t do any good so far as
British buyers are concerned; economic
conditions in other countries still look
dicy.
London sources indeed have com-
pounded the gloom by their latest re-
ports. They expect a period of quite
shaky markets, stating quite simply that
the world is producing too much wool.
The Commonwealth Economic Com-
mittee’s first production forecast for
1967-68 predicts an output of 2800
million lb. on a clean basis —another
record and 2 percent more than last
season.
The consumption picture looks un-
happy. The first six months of this
year saw world consumption, 928.6
million lb., represent a 100 million lb.
decline on the corresponding previous
period. Big falls (in demand) are re-
corded from U.S.A., Britain, France,
West Germany, and Holland. For-
tunately for Australia, Japan and Italy
are in a phase of rising consumption.
But it is sobering to realise that the
greatest drift in demand has occurred
among apparel wools, which largely
derive from fine Merinos.
Agrisearch
Rushing into cotton
OVER IRRIGATION the cavaliers
and the roundheads have never quit
battling. The field has always been
filled with visionaries contending
against the cautious softhearts skirm-
ishing with hardheads, developers teas-
ing the economists, and politicians plot-
ting against the planners. ■ For the
moment, however, the cavaliers seem
to have swept all aside and won a
significant victory. The sudden
announcement of Federal grants
amounting to $6B million for irrigation
projects on the Ord and Nogoa Rivers
makes further controversy futile.
Cotton and sorghum are to be the
principal crops at both places, with
wheat, pasture, and lucerne as addi-
tional crops on the Nogoa. An ex-
panded beef industry is confidently
expected in each neighborhood, as there
will be lashings of protein-rich by-
product from the cotton to supplement
the nutritionally deficient sorghum
grain. Export opportunities for this
inferior cereal are assured, according to
the Minister for National Development.
This means he expects Japan to buy it,
We seem to be rushing into cotton
on a gargantuan scale, even while our
established wool industry is reeling and
cotton itself suffering from the competi-
tion being offered by the artificial
fibres. The simple fact is that the world
is growing or making enough fibre for
its present and foreseeable needs, but
not nearly enough food. Briefly, there

WE DON’T
MIND GETTING
OUR ROOTS
DIRTY!
In fact, at Austral-Pacific Fertilizers
we like it that way! Our boots were
made for working in the fields, in
the office, in the laboratory. We like
our work and we won’t be stop-
ping to shake the dust off our feet.
We've got the future planned. Sure,
we’re pretty new on the Australian
agricultural scene. But we’ve done a
lot of research, because without re-
search there's no way of building the
future we plan. We’re making friends
with the men on the land. Our clients.
We have something new to offer them.
A new range of advanced fertilizers. A
new concept in service. A new growing
technique that is planned to improve
crops and increase yield. The way we
figure it, our future is out there in the
fields. We'll get good Australian soil on
our boots . . . and that’s the way we
like it!

are about 15 important centres already
growing cotton in Australia and all of
them have tremendous potential for
expansion. The Namoi betokens this.
In 1960 there were about 50 acres
planted to cotton in that district. Last
year w r ell over 25,000 acres, averaging
almost two bales, were grown; this is
still only about half the potential
development. An equal area could be-
come available from the waters of the
nearby Gwydir River. The very suc-
cess of the Namoi venture has engen-
dered a hint of gloom among the
growers because the bounty declines as
the volume of production rises. They
are already casting around for alter-
native cash crops.
But the total cotton-growing area of
the north-west of New South Wales
makes small beer compared with the
Murrumbidgee-Murray region. When
the Snowy Scheme is complete there
will be enough water and, with the
addition of the Coleambally area,
enough land for nearly one million
acres of cotton. By Australian stan-
dards yields are high, too. Similarly,
the Nogoa project in the Emerald dis-
trict of Queesland is relatively small.
It will irrigate only about 50,000 acres,
but if the Burdekin cotton-growing
business goes ahead it could eventually
extend over about half a million acres.
The Condamine, Mary, Dawson, and
Border Rivers also carry small cotton
industries which could expand quickly
to a total of perhaps a quarter million
acres. Several other promising patches
are also to be found elsew'here in
Queensland and south of the border.
Across the other side of the country
the existing Bandicoot Bar Weir on the
Ord permits up to 15,000 acres of
cotton. The proposed main dam, which
will now be built about 30 miles up-
stream from Kununurra, will hold
ample water for another 200,000 acres.
Then there are those who say we should
be exploiting the natural rainfall and
cheap labor of Papua-New Guinea to
grow large quantities of cotton.
Apart from marketing considerations,
there are natural reasons why Aus-
tralia should not go in for irrigated
cotton in a big way. The crop requires
a relatively great amount of water per
unit of product, and water is our
scarcest resource. An average figure
would be about 800 gallons of water
for lib. of lint, whereas 200 gallons
would grow a pound of rice. Tobacco
and most kinds of vegetables and fruits
need less than 50 gallons per pound of
product. Besides, these are high-value
crops. Up till now Queensland has
tended to use irrigation water for such
crops rather than for cereals and pas-
ture. Thus, although the State has
only a tiny fraction of, say, Victoria’s
acreage under irrigation, the value of
the produce grown is nearly half that
of Victoria’s. Victoria uses most of her
irrigation water indirectly and waste-
fully to raise meat and milk.

ENTERTAINMENT
One-man cultural complex
By ROBERT WARD
SOME FOUR YEARS AGO, with
flourish and high seriousness the august
members of the Adelaide City Council
produced sketch plans of Adelaide’s
Festival Hall. It was shaped not unlike
a covered wagon. Its site was to be on
Montefiore Hill, overlooking Adelaide,
and the large house situated there was
duly purchased from the Bonython
family. The hall was to be completed
in time for the 1966 Festival, and
$2 million were needed to pay for it.
The idea naturally caused some com-
ment, even unkind when it came to the
design, but really found trouble when
some citizens complained that the site
was too far from public transport, and
others that gracious living in the area
might become a little graceless before
and after shows. The matter really
stopped there, though committees have
been formed, reports have been pre-
sented, and costs risen to some
four million for an all-purpose cultural
complex.
At this point, enter Derek Jolly,
sometime racing-car driver, now a self-
described Lower North Adelaide empire-
builder. With visions of a hall equal to
the famous Snape-Maltings Hall used
for the Aldeburgh Festival, he an-
nounced that he would form a trust to
build a concert hall as a memorial to
the late Professor John Bishop, who
had been Artistic Director of the Festi-
val and a friend and mentor to Jolly.
The announcement caused consterna-
tion in the pro-Festival Hall circles,
since money from one project could be
diverted to the other, cheaper one.
Kym Bonython .wrote a letter to the
Press denouncing the idea, and for a
time it looked as if the two cultural
entrepreneurs were about to lock in
combat. Many people felt any hall
would be better than none. With a com-
mission from the Bishop family, Jolly
set about organising designers, project-
ing costs, and detailing the establish-
ment of the Trust.
Derek Jolly is a very persistent man,
and this may indeed be an important
asset in his current endeavors to move
official mountains. I visited him in his
Decca’s (his nickname) Place office the
week preceding his Sound and Image
presentation of Benjamin Britten’s
“War Requiem” with the poems of
Wilfred Owen. On that day, its
straightforward good taste suffered
from confusion of papers, slides, tape-
recorders, projection equipment, and
screens. He explained that “you just
can’t bring World War I into the
Bonython Hall by flicking your fingers.”
His photo shows a somewhat severe
and possibly petulant man, but not his
expansive, frank, and genuinely friendly
manner. He takes a “look, no hands”
pride in his achievements, and feels that
with the establishment of the hall, there
simply will be “no limits” to the
development of the area. He would like
it and Decca’s Place to be a focus for
all the creative arts, a place where style
in such things as shopping and eat-
ing are minor extensions of the real
artistic experience.
He commenced buying land in Mel-
bourne Street in 1963. By turning an
old house into a popular restaurant,
adding a gallery, shops, and brick-paved
arcades, courtyards, and trellises and
high white Mediterranean walls, he set
a pattern which is being followed
throughout the area by developers
crowding in after him. Small cottages
once priced at $lOOO are now fetch-
ing that tenfold. The facades are re-
moved, the foundations strengthened,
the front rooms extended, a show win-
dow is added, white paint or the var-
nished original stone completes the
development and, presto, another
boutique.
Seeing this development follow him
gives him immense confidence. On his
mother’s side, he is a Penfold-Hyland,
hence the Decca’s Place Wine Shop
and his financial strength and indepen-
dence. Of Penfolds, he says “this is such
a colossus that you feel you can move
the world.” He shows visitors the plans
and photos of the Snape-Maltings Hall,
superbly functional with pitched roof,
wood beams, stone walls, and the care-
fully blending textures.
He remains reticent about his school-
days at St. Peters College, Adelaide,
and Geelong Grammar School. On
leaving school he spent some ten yeai's
with Penfolds (in between trips abroad,
photography, and car racing), but
found himself temperamentally unsuited
to the organisation-man role. He com-
menced car-racing in 1948, and still
holds two Australian land-speed records.
His racing career went into decline with
a serious accident in 1958 from which
he was lucky to escape with only six
months in hospital. He designed and
built his own racing car in 14 weeks,
starting from first principles. “There-
fore, I think I can design a recital hall
without much trouble. If I can’t find
an answer, I’ll read a book or ring
London look, Fred, you’re the expert
in these things, how do you do it . .
He is thus a rare man in Australia,
the rich, cultivated dilettante. His pho-
tography wins international prizes; his
photographic studies of German
Baroque Churches are used in archi-
tectural text-books. His development of
the Sound and Image concept on which
he has spent both a great deal of time
and a small fortune, could be described
as ground work for what could be
a new mode of creative expression.
He feels indebted in this to Profes-
sor John Bishop, who persuaded the
Festival organisers to take a serious
interest in Sound and Image presen-
tations. With the Memorial Hall he
intends to establish a music and drama
school, and his present estimate of the
total cost is half a million dollars. He
does not believe there will be difficulty
in finding this amount, so long as the
project engages the imagination of the
city (“a bloke I know has 40,000 West-
ern Mining shares and so much money
he doesn’t know what to with it, then
there’s the brewery, and so on”).
He has interested Roy Grounds in the
project, selecting him because “it must
have a name.” “I rang him one night.
You’ve never heard of me, I said, but
did you know Professor John Bishop?”
He had, and so Roy Grounds and his
design assistant came to Adelaide re-
cently, and will now prepare basic
sketch plans and projections.
Roy Grounds is not the only “name”
assisting. Tom Brown from the National
Institute of Dramatic Art was enlisted,
as well as John Tasker of the South
Australian Theatre Company. Jolly has
also invited submissions from drama
companies, musicians, and composers,
and with their response, his enthusiasm
has become boundless.
“I want to do this here. I want to
build this thing up,” he explained,
walking nervously across the office.
“We’ll have a four-track machine to
jump sound all round the hall; there’ll
be a superb bio box for the Film Festi-
val; a rear projection box and special
screens will enable projected images to
be blended with the action in Children’s
theatre; there’ll be an orchestra pit so
that we can have light opera; there’ll
be superb acoustics for chamber music.
If you’ve got the will to do it, the time
to do it, the money to do it, and the
place to do it, as I have here, there’s
no limit.”
At this point he broke off to talk to
a council health inspector, who had
come to see him about the proposed
site of an ice-cream machine. Another
facet presented itself . . .

So Abram rose, and clave the wood and went,
And took the fire with 'him, and a knife
Behold the preparations, fire and iron,
But where the lamb-for this burnt offering?
And stretched forth the knife to slay his son.
And as they sojourned both of them together,
Isaac the first-born spake and said, My Father,
Then Abram bound the youth with belts and straps,
And budded parapets and trenches there,
When lo! an angel called him out of heaven,

Music for
minorities
By DAVID SALTER
SOMETIMES it is hard to decide what
Musica Viva is trying to do. It is no
longer enough to accept them simply
as an organisation which promotes
chamber music performance in this
country. They have been doing that
successfully for decades. With their
financial strength and long-established
national concert circuit, Musica Viva
are entrepreneurs of influence and
power second only to the ABC. As
such they share with the Commission
a responsibility for the welfare of Aus-
tralian music and musicians, a respon-
sibility the Society has been, unfortun-
ately, inconsistent in assuming.
Musica Viva has released to the Press
the details of their subscription concert
series offerings for 1968. The format
is all too familiar: four overseas groups
(The Zagreb Soloists, Borodin String
Quartet, Bath Festival Ensemble, and
Parrenin String Quartet), and one Aus-
tralian, the newly formed Attic
Chamber Ensemble. If anything, this
line-up represents a decline of Musica
Viva interest in local music. Last year
we heard two Australian groups. The
concert outlook for resident chamber
musicians continues to look bleak.
This attitude seems particularly bull-
headed following so closely on the
Society’s successful Spring Festival in
Canberra. There, in the splendid new
Theatre Centre, Australian musicians
played the standard repertoire and
20th-century works to enthusiastic,
almost capacity, houses. These players
from Sydney, Melbourne, and Canberra
were in many ways the strength of the
festival, and the solid response to the
morning seminars on contemporary
composition indicated that the average
Musica Viva subscriber is genuinely
interested in what has been happening-
in sound after Bartok.
But what is the prospect which faces
him next year? The usual, tired pro-
gression of European artists and their
Haydn-to-Brahms style programs. There
should be many excellent performances,
but viewed as a whole, this season will
be a repetition of a wheezy old formula.
Surely the experience of Canberra and
the richness of musical activity through-
out Australia, which the festival un-
covered, could justly have been a factor
influencing Musica Viva’s choice of
engagements for the 1968 season. It
has not been so.
The Musica Viva policy denies
native musicians the valuable and
sorely needed “exposure” they could
gain from touring the Society’s capital
city circuit. It is true that a small
number of local ensembles the Syd-
ney String Quartet, University of
Adelaide Wind Quintet, the Austral
and Cremona Quartets have given
recitals in the subscription series over
the past few years, but these are well-
established groups made up of estab-
lished orchestral players or teachers.
Also, with the few customary national-
istic exceptions (Bartok, Martinu,
Janacek, Hindemith), the Musica Viva’s
programs seem to deny the existence of
music before Haydn or after Debussy.
The very groups to present these neg-
lected periods are those Musica Viva
chooses to ignore.
Our regular concertgoer may ask:
“OK, so where are these groups?” and
with good reason: unless he takes the
trouble of tracking them dow r n to their
occasional performances in out-of-the-
way halls, he will never hear the music
they champion. In Sydney alone there
are instrumentalists, many of them
professional, devoting their spare
rehearsal time to the Baroque and
avant garde, with little hope of having
their work appraised in a fully
organised, secure setting.
Three such ensembles are the New
Sydney Woodwind Quintet, the Leonine
Consort, and the Don Burrows Modern
Jazz Quartet. Midweek or Sunday
evening outings in the Cell Block
Theatre (whatever happened to the
Musica Viva Sunday recitals?) do not
give these excellent musicians the large-
audience outlet they deserve. If the
Burrows group was considered accom-
plished enough to represent Australian
jazz at Expo 67, it seems tragically
hypocritical of the major local music
bodies that they have been asked to give
only three or four concerts here over
the past two years. Both the N.S.W.Q.
and the Leonine Consort have for most
of their performances had to take the
considerable financial risk of organising
and promoting their own concerts.
There is precious little time left for
rehearsal.
At a stage when adventurous, experi-
mental programming has at last become
an accepted revitalising part of the
music business, Musica Viva appears
resigned to a lifespan corresponding
with that of their regular subscribers.
Cater for a single, restricted market
long enough and you will share its even-
tual passage into extinction.
A concert during the University Arts
Festival in Sydney early this year com-
bined a first half of Gothic and
Medieval music with an avant garde
second half, ending with a work for
amplified flute, cello, piano, clockwork
78 rpm record-player, electronic sound
generator, full organ and ad lib stray
dog. It was well attended, successful,
and made money. A Musica Viva audi-
ence, served by an executive of liberal
enthusiasm, could be given the oppor-
tunity of enjoying something similar.
Opera
In praise of
Miss Bronhill
By JOHN CARGHER
Don Pasquale. Donizetti. Elizabethan
Trust Opera. Princess, Melbourne.
I AM TIRED of cynics who accuse
June Bronhill of being operetta-ish.
Without prior knowledge of her back-
ground no man in his right senses
would see or hear her Norina in the
new “Don Pasquale” as anything but a
first-rate operatic portrayal. Miss Bron-
hill sings better than most sopranos
available in this role on discs and her
acting ability is astronomical in terms
of normal opera standards. She could
do worse than to reduce her fee to
enable the Trust to engage her per-
manently.
The rest of this long overdue produc-
tion of a delightful opera is almost up
to Miss Bronhill’s level. Stefan Haag
shows once again how much better he
is as a producer of opera than as its
administrator. A “season” of two opera,
both using the same four principals is
sheer lunacy. It is bad for the singers
who are overworked*, bad for the
critics and first-nighters, who get tired
of the same faces, and bad for the
audiences who are inevitably fobbed off
with different singers from those
praised by the Press. Still, on stage
Mr. Haag is most effective. I suspect
the occasional falls from grace by the
artists were due more to overlap from
last week’s “Fledermaus” than his direc-
tion.
How well he has judged his produc-
tion is clear from the best performance
for many years by Ronald Maconaghie
as Dr. Malatesta. Gone are all those
irritating exaggerations; instead we get
a fine characterisation and equally good
singing, both in strong contrast to his
other doctor (Falke) only a few days
ago. Neil Warren-Smith is as good
as usual in the title role, though his
diction is beginning to slip, and Robert
Gard makes much of the ineffectual
Ernesto.
The settings by George Molnar are
unusual and witty and the translation
Stefan Haag has supplied himself is
happily free of the usual poor puns.
Though much of this production is
inconsistent and ridiculously out of
period (on what basis is Pasquale an ex-
soldier of the Kaiser’s Army?) the whole
thing jells very nicely and proves con-
clusively that opera can be entertaining
without being “popularised.”
*1 note a fine performance by John
Pringle taking the place of Neil
Warren-Smith in later performances of
“Die Fledermaus.” Pringle is no better
today than he was three years ago, but
it apparently needed a Sun Aria win to
convince the Trust that he is good
enough. Why overwork Neil Warren-
Smith while singer-actors of Pringle’s
calibre are in the company?


“Barman, I’ll have a
Campari with chunks
o£ ice and a big shush
o£ soda.”
“Sorry, Sir, there’s no
Campari left.”
“That’s too bad it’s
so gloriously pink and
cryptically bitter. All
right, I’ll try it with
vermouth and ice.”
“But I said there
wasn’t any Campari.”
“Oh I see. Did you
know it was made with
herbs from four con-
tinents macerated in
pure grape spirit in
oaken vats? 0.K., give
me Campari and gin
and don’t forget the
ice.”
“Listen. There-is-no-
Campari. It’s all gone!
No more. None left.
FINISHED! We have
everything else, but no
Campari.”
“Oh very well then,
I’ll have a Campari.”

Films
Busy, busy "Shrew"
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
The Taming of the Shrew. Director,
Franco Zeffirelli.
This Property Is Condemned. Director,
Sydney Pollack.
Up the Down Staircase. Director,
Robert Mulligan.
SHAKESPEARE gets lost among the
decorations and frantic caperings of
Zeffirelli’s film: but this doesn’t matter
too much with “The Taming of the
Shrew.” Let’s face it, it’s a pretty
terrible play, though understandably
beloved by actors, to whom it gives
unparalleled opportunities to shout,
jump about, and show off generally. A
too-reverent attitude to The Bard is to
be avoided in any case and would be
absurd with this play; but Zeffirelli’s
screen version, though arresting to the
eye, is unnecessarily overwrought, over-
elaborate, and noisy.
The ripe, softly glowing color and
the composition of the scenes are
always a pleasure to watch, though
Zeffirelli’s determination not to leave
a square inch of the screen idle is a
little tiring. The director obviously
feels that Shakespeare needs all the
external visual help he can get so that
the first encounter of Petruchio and
Kate (an entertaining battle of wits
and sharp tongues) is lost in a frantic
chase over rooftops and collapsing lad-
ders reminiscent of a Mack Sennett
comedy.
The shrew and her tamer are not a
particularly attractive pair, but I don’t
think they need be as oafish and grace-
less as they are here. Elizabeth Taylor
at her shrillest makes Kate more like
a fishwife (whatever that may be) than
a well-born lady who happens to be
ill-tempered, and her conversion to
loving mildness happens with jolting
suddenness. Richard Burton, evidently
determined to live down his reputation
as a Shakespearian actor, plays
Petruchio as a roaring, low-class lout.
Zeffirelli now threatens us with a
screen version of “Romeo and Juliet”
presented as a cinema-verite docu-
mentary. Oh lor!
“This Property Is Condemned” is
also based on a play, but in this case
it has been expanded instead of cut
down. Tennessee Williams’ original was
a one-acter, with a derelict child
reminiscing about the fate of her
idolised elder sister; here, by grace of
the flashback, we are shown the whole
story. I haven’t read the original play,
but surely the child’s memories can’t
have been as involved and detailed as
this.
Natalie Wood, in a very patchy per-
formance, plays a beautiful girl grow-
ing up in a depression-ridden town, used
by her mother to attract lodgers to
her dishevelled boarding-house, wor-
shipped by her gawky sister, herself
lost in dreams of escape.
There are moments of poetry and
nostalgia probably the authentic
Williams lines and generally good
performances, especially from Kate Reid
as the mother; but the motivations of
the characters, particularly the central
one, are muddled and unconvincing,
and the final impression of the film is
unsatisfying.
By far the most interesting and likable
movie of the week is “Up the Down
Staircase,” though it begins with did-
actic solemnity and ends in a glow of
selfconscious optimism. But, despite its
efforts to behave like a tract, the sen-
sitively written script and a first-class
cast make the greater part of it human,
humorous, and realistic. Sandy Dennis’
mannerisms are at first obtrusive, but
are soon suppressed in her thoroughly
credible performance as the starry-eyed
new teacher at an overcrowded, under-
staffed school who goes through disillu-
sionment and disappointment but at last
begins to see what teaching really
means.
Though the ending is a little too
sunny, the film usually avoids easy
solutions. The script has an accurate
feeling for behaviour and conversation,
and the scenes with Ellen O’Hara, as
a plain girl with a hopeless crush on a
male teacher, are handled with memor-
able delicacy, tact, and feeling.

IN A SAMPLING of 1960-1967 works

scorn for orthodoxy, Edwin Tanner is
anti-mainstream and anti-tributary, too;
it’s his dry, detached wit, accompanied
by lean forms and a dehydrated, un-

revolutionary iconoclasm. While he
has little whimsy, he’s too tongue-in-
cheek to be bitter. His is the art of
civilised, as opposed to slick and sophis-
ticated, comment on bathers, bikes,
boats, and bones. Wit and crisp linearity
unite the works, from the bones stick-
ing out of pale sands (one called Las-
seter At It Again), the bathers of 1961
twisting in springy contours over the
banal blue ocean and the drawing of a
bike, strung up on a clothes-line by
some surreal prankster for cleaning, to

Thank heavens, they are works hard
to live with: the thin, teetering dun
ships in dry dock are about to fall;
Old Mari of the Sea is white paddle-
wheeler cum Christmas cracker in bitter
Tucker-color and in The Transcenden-
tal World of Musical Enchantment
elongated instruments swing in space
with an odd tempo. Laputa, with its
flying saucer above uninhibited green,
gives some idea of his mild Swiftianism
and a trio of ancient cannon, called
Ordinance, chides his own concern for
order; a wayward, maverick talent, but
not a minor one.
Ron Lambert seems worried about
the direction of his talents; identified
with a lush, slabby abstraction of glow-
ing reds, slumbrous blues, and crisp
greens fecund, lambent, loose, vib-
rant, and luscious now reacts to the
feast with a fast of black and white
De Kooning style drawings and hard-
edge shapes of buffers, mounds, and pal-
ings, as though he needed to approach
hard-edge by retracing the paths of
New Yorkers or Dick Watkins. This
retardataire and didactic demonstration
has excited Sydney comment, but he’s
still best when impulsive gestures erode
large areas (Mark Aslan), when action-
painting pressure is retained in Steady
State 11, where one of two black slabs
wants to join a thin vertical and when
some of his love of looking through
color survives in his gluing black on
black and white on white. Maybe it’s
hard for action men like Lambert and
Michael Taylor amid all the hosannas
for hard-edge not to think their modes
invalid.
As though to prove that no mode is
entirely without value, Rudy Kornon, in
a fine mixture of 32 paintings, shows
how three heads by Drysdale, Nolan,
and Dobell, who provide scope for com-
parison and for discussion on how psy-
chologically revelatory the “portrait”
is, go along with Aspden’s oblong of
chrome yellow-green banded on three
sides with bars of purple, orange, and
green, a work as adventitiously suggest-
ive of nature’s mystic forces as eleventh-
century “illuminated” illustrations were
deliberately of the ways of God and His
creation.
The above are the artists of the
solid form and the icon, as are Brack
and Pugh, the latter’s resurgence of
power evident in the fine play of
angularities as a boy crouches beneath a
crow, a pale gum uniting them like a
flash of fear and the former’s satire on
Edwardian (?) entertainment grating on
one’s aesthetic teeth for, under a sour
limelight, amid cloying green, a cheesy-
fleshed female skater is held aloft by
a hussar of the rink, his head looking
like cubism adulterated for commerce.
The fragmenters of form soften the
scene, even if Eric Smith’s self-portrait
is aciduously ironic with skilfully placed
collages of Bonnard, Matisse, Cezanne,
Rouault, Picasso, and Manessier (a real
art-school sight test) on the top left,
and of art prizes in the bottom right;
the agile, scattered brush strokes also
reflect Smith’s divided loyalties; Tony
Underhill so dissolves ruddy oranges
and greens that he makes flesh of sun-
light; in Arthur Boyd, red and black
humans, a black rococo ram and the
twining forests toss in a vortex, like a
darker, denser Van Gogh and the same
energy is deceptively latent in Black-
man’s girls (London, 1964-65) with
indeterminated mottled areas, fading
faces, and a sudden declamation of red
stripes disrupting the shadowy, balmy
silence.
Fred Williams, Rapotec, and Olsen
display a similar immersion in experi-
ence; Williams holds in view a long
frieze of scatty trees; Rapotec sees
Venice rapturously raddled, and Olsen’s
1962 pastel stroll makes a palimpsest of
surprises.
Among the analysts of form is Judy
Cassab, whose dark orange wedge stills
the wavering slivers of green, but it is
William Wright’s uneasy amalgam of
dark planes in large figure which is
closest to the dynamic analysis of
cubism.

Theatre
"Salesman"
revived
By PHILLIP ADAMS
Death of a Salesman. Arthur Miller.
Russell St., Melbourne.
Pygmalion. Bernard Shaw. The Pump-
kin Players, Melbourne.
“OPENING NIGHT? It’s more like
opening a grave,” said an actor as the
bells rang in the foyer. I wasn’t looking
forward to it much, either, because the
evening was bound to be anti-climactic.
The last time I’d seen “Death of a
Salesman” eleven years ago it
had overwhelmed me. Nothing I’ve seen
Carmen Duncan and James Condon in
“The Cocktail Party.” Independent,
Sydney
since has had quite the same impact.
Furthermore, Miller’s “After the Fall”
(that unspeakable orgy of self-pity
and moral posturing) had called all his
work into question. So, dreading the
loss of a beautiful memory, I watched
Willy Loman carry his suitcases on to
the stage.
It’s now 20 years since Miller
labored mightily to transform Willy’s
suburban fatality into classic tragedy.
Miller was determined to show that the
common man (equals low man, equals
Loman) was “as apt a subject for
tragedy in its highest sense as kings
were.” But while “Salesman” is a devas-
tating piece of sociology, to compare
Willy to Hamlet is like comparing- a
bar-room brawl with Agincourt. Cracks
have opened in the work. In an attempt
to dignify the ordinary, Miller tended
to make some of his dialogue pon-
derous with fake classicism. The char-
acters are too lacking in mystery or
enigma to provoke any arguments over
interpretation. And, where even Ham-
let’s tragedy is leavened and intensified
with humor, Miller’s piece is unremit-
tingly marmoreal and puritan.
There’s also the considerable produc-
tion problem of Happy and Biff, who
are required to alternate between mid-
teens and mid-thirties over and over
again during proceedings. Inevitably,
this means that the price of plausible
adults is grotesque schoolboys. Yet,
despite its blemishes, the play remains
a major achievement in modern theatre.
The world in which destiny is a hire-
purchase contract and fate an insur-
ance policy is brilliantly synthesised,
and the second act retains its power to
stupefy an audience. And on a techni-
cal level the Marienbad-stvle time
changes work brilliantly.
Sumner’s new production is thorough
and impressive, with English actor
Raymond Westwell turning in a con-
vincing performance despite occasional
troubles with his accent. As Biff, George
Whaley sustains a dangerous level of
intensity and brings it off. But Joan
Bruce’s Linda is sadly lightweight.
The Pumpkin Players are an extra-
ordinary amateur group who’ve trans-
formed a decrepit church hall into an
elegant and extremely comfortable
theatre. “Pygmalion” is their second
production, and while it sounds a little
bleak without those all-too-familiar
songs it’s an impressive job. I never
cease to be amazed by people who
work so hard without the inducement
of money.
Eliot revisited
By MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
The Cocktail Party. T. S. Eliot. Inde-
pendent, Sydney.
“WHY ON EARTH did they choose
'The Cocktail Party’ to start off their
ambitious new professional repertory
theatre?” everyone seemed to be asking,
including myself. It came as a very-
pleasant surprise, therefore, to find
that, in Robert Levis’ enjoyable pro-
duction, “The Cocktail Party” is very-
much alive. Why did so many of us
think that the play was dead?
T. S. Eliot presumably cast his play
with its rather bleak view of human
existence, in the form of a drawing-
room comedy-cum-supernatural thriller,
for purposes of painless consumption.
But at that time everyone was so weary
of drawing-room comedies that even an
extraordinary one like this was hard
to take. Add to this that the theatre
seemed lifeless and effete, and it is
understandable that Eliot's rather blood-
less plays did not appear to herald a
renaissance in drama.
But, in the 18 years since then, the
great surge of energy that has swelled
through the theatre in England has
swept away the drawing-room comedy,
just as the social change which gave
rise to it has removed the figures in
the drawing-rooms from the centre of
the stage. After those exuberant years
of experiment in the theatre, we are in
a much better mood to appreciate
Eliot’s qualities: his mastery of form,
his wit and intelligence, and his austere
view of life.
Austere, but in some way rather cosy.
Although he sees sexual love as purely
selfish, a form of self-expression, he be-
lieves that marriage and family life are
a good thing, provided that both part-
ners are clear what the score is. Edward
and Lavinia Chamberlayne have to win
through to the knowledge of their own
and each other’s selfishness and unlov-
ableness before they can begin to get on
with the ordinary round of life, which
appears to be one long, but much in-
terrupted, cocktail party.
Celia, Edward’s former mistress, has
to discover that she is meant for a higher
and colder destiny than the party round.
Peter Quilpe, Lavinia’s former lover,
who now loves Celia, has to go to Cali-
fornia without her and attend the cock-
tail parties there alone. (Actually, it is
one of the mysteries in the play which
is never cleared up whether they have
cocktail parties in California.)
Although the message is that each
human being is totally alone and can
expect no love or help from any other
human being, the four human beings in
the play are helped constantly, whether
they like it or not, by the three myster-
ious Guardians. The activities of these
benign busybodies provide the elements
of farce and mystery which beguile the
audience.
In the past year Alexander Hay has
played a monsignor and a Pope, but he
really excels himself in the part of God
in a dark business suit, drily self-mock-
ing as the famous psychiatrist Sir Henry
Harcourt-Reilly. The little scene in
which, still the Unidentified Guest drink-
ing gin and water, he suddenly bursts
into song with “One-Eyed Riley” before
lurching off is worth going to the
theatre to see in itself.
The secret of success with this play
is that the characters must all, with the
exception of Celia, be played as a bit
unlovable. It is a tribute to the skill
and discipline of this new professional
» repertory company that they manage
this very well. Aileen Britton is brisk
and tough as old Julia, the cocktail-
party veteran. James Condon manages
Edward’s stolidity perfectly, but Jacque-
line Kott slightly overdoes Lavinia’s
unlovableness, Carmen Duncan is
beautiful and appealing as Celia, but
she is less convincing after the iron has
entered into Celia’s spirit. Ross Thomp-
son is good as a bewildered Peter and
Donald Macdonald’s Alex, although
perhaps more of a playboy than Eliot
intended, has a light touch.

How to increase
recall on your
TV commercials... 53%
Research
uncluttered commercials give a
hidden cost per 1000 advantage!
It’s vital for all advertisers to know the potential recall of commercials
but until last week nobody knew for sure. So GTV9 and TCN9
commissioned Audience Studies Inc., a leading international research
organisation, to study TV commercial effectiveness. They showed
similarly matched audiences a current TV programme changing
the number of commercials in the programme each time.
The results proved a hunch we’d had for years. If your commercial
is screened along with 13 others, as compared to being one of only 8,
then your chance of recall drops 53%. GTV9 and TCN9 guarantee
you greater recall because we never run more than 9 minutes of
commercials in any prime time hour although the Australian
Broadcasting Control Board allows 11 minutes.
Put your product on Channel 9 Sydney and Melbourne. Join the
list of those who realise that our uncluttered commercial policy gives
them a hidden cost-per-thousand advantage in commercial effectiveness.

BOOKS
Svetlanas peephole into the
cave of Neanderthal monsters
By FRANK KNOPFELMACHER
20 Letters to a Friend. Svetlana Allilu-
yeva. Hutchinson. $4.00.
MRS. ALLILUYEVA IS a charming
woman. She comes out sincerely and
well on the greatest of all lie-detectors,
a protracted TV close-up. Yet fate
willed her to be the daughter of a
monster who has destroyed and
blighted more lives than any other
single man in history and whose heri-
tage still continues to poison the air
we breathe. It is, therefore, necessary
to repress one’s gentlemanly impulses
which urge that Stalin’s daughter
should be treated with quiet tact, char-
ity, and forbearance, and proceed to
consider her book and the personality
which it reveals as a crucial datum of
social pathology. Hers is the fate of
innocent people stricken with rare but
terrible diseases: they, too, must yield
themselves up to the embarrassing curi-
osity of doctors and medical students
in the interest of humanity.
The circumstances of Alliluyeva’s
defection are well known and do not
require recapitulation. Stalin was mar-
ried twice, and he had three children:
■one from his first and two from his
second marriage. Svetlana is the young-
est of the three, the only daughter and
the only one alive. She is also the only
“intact” survivor of Stalin’s family.
Most of the others were either liquid-
ated by their illustrious relative or
driven into suicide or premature death
by persecution and relentless psycho-
logical pressure. Svetlana’s mother com-
mitted suicide by shooting in 1932 a day
after her husband had publicly insulted
her. Stalin treated his family pretty
much as he treated other members of
the New Class: he pampered and cor-
rupted them materially, reduced them
to moral wrecks, and then disposed of
them.
The claim made on behalf of the
book by Crankshaw that it is “a unique
masterpiece” which will force us to
rewrite all past histories of Russia is,
of course, utter nonsense. The style is
that of a women’s magazine featuring a
sob-story from a “gentlewoman in dis-
tress.” It is not “great,” not even med-
ium, literature. As an account of history
the book is almost completely worth-
less. The two principal assertions of the
authoress, namely, that Stalin became
“another man” driven into monstrous
deeds by the suicide of his second
wife and that he was a trusting tool
in the hands of the evil and scheming
Beria, can be dismissed out of hand.
Stalin’s political style was sufficiently
obvious as early as 1924 to persuade
Lenin to write his famous anti-Stalin
“testament.” Stalin’s first venture into
outright totalitarian genocide the
liquidation of the kulaks started in
1928 and it was well under way when
Nadezhda Alliluyeva pulled the trigger
in 1932. And as for Beria, suffice to
say that he was appointed head of the
NKVD in 1938 after the peak of the
Great Purge had been reached. He
succeeded Yezhov, the actual “admin-
istrator” of the Purge (known among
Russians to this day as “the Yezhov-
shchina”), and proceeded at once to
liquidate the liquidators, to dismantle
Yezhov’s apparatus.
Like most other autobiographies,
Alliluyeva’s book is valuable above all
as a set of sociological data about her-
self and the society which made her
rather than as a story. Most of the im-
portant facts the book conveys are not
those which Alliluyeva thinks important
and certainly not those in which she
put her main emphasis. The really
illuminating revelations are the “inci-
dental” ones. The first thing to notice
is Alliluyeva’s curious moral “inno-
cence” or perhaps blindness. Take the
following passage:
“Up to 1933, then our household was
run in a perfectly normal way . . .
All the Soviet leaders lived pretty
much like this at that time. No one
cared about luxury or possessions,
though they did try to give a good
education to their children. They hired
good governesses of the old, pre-revolu-
tionary school, mostly Germans. All the
wives had jobs and read all they could
in their spare time. Sports had just
come into style. All of them played
tennis and they had tennis courts and
croquet lawns at their dachas ... In
summer my parents went to Sochi
this had become like a regular thing
with them . . . We stayed in a small
dacha near Matsesta, where my father
was taking warm baths for his rheu-
matism. It was only after my mother
died that they started building him
special dachas. My mother didn’t live
to see all this luxury paid for out of
limitless public funds . . . During my
mother’s lifetime we had a normal
modest life.”
You see, at a time when the ordinary
Russian lived under near-famine con-
ditions lacking the most elementary
amenities and when Russia resembled
one huge, miserable slum, the dictators
on behalf of the proletariat had “only”
several dachas, private tutors for their
kids, and their own croquet and tennis
courts. Real corruption and luxury,
Alliluyeva tells us in all innocence,
came later with palaces, sumptuous
orgies, and NKVD-run byzantine courts
for the despot and his courtiers.
Nowhere is there any awareness that her
Svetlana in the television interview seen in Australia


father as well as her other “old bol-
shevik” relatives were transacting a
monstrous fraud. Her chief charge
against Stalin is that he was not kind.
The fact that kindness alone cannot
change the morally monstrous fact of
a “dictatorship of the proletariat” in
which the bosses hire German nurses
for their brats while the children of
workers and peasants roam the streets
hungry and bereft, and where the bosses
play croquet in secluded dachas while
the proletariat sleeps on pavements and
dies in famines man-made by the
irresponsible policies of the croquet-
playing “leaders of the proletariat”
does not seem to have occurred to Mrs.
Alliluyeva, whose thinking is closer to
Marie Antoinette than to Charlotte
Corday. As a type, Mrs. Alliluyeva is
a bundle of Victorian sentimentality
and hide-bound political innocence of
the kind one used to encounter among
emigre White Russian aristocrats after
World War I. Like them she does not
understand what went wrong and what
hit her. Her newly discovered senti-
mental religiosity merely completes the
analogy.
The chief value of the book is that
it provides us with the biggest peep-
hole yet into the cave of the Soviet
neanderthaler. It shows the life-style of
a new oligarchy, coarse, brutal, amoral.
It seems that the corruption of the
bolshevik elites started almost at once
when power brought opportunity. The
old generation was, at times, rather
melancholic about the whole business,
and sad. Particularly Bukharin. In the
only really moving passage in the book
Alliluyeva describes Bukharin’s rather
shadowy and sad presence and his love
of animals: he had a tame fox, who
was still roaming the corridors of the
Kremlin unattended two years after his
master’s murder. Stalin’s in-laws and
their relatives were among the old bol-
shevik elite, too, and they entertained
occasionally and sporadically some
doubts about what went on, but like
the rest they took what they were given.
The Great Purge replaced the old
Doubting Thomases of power and cor-
ruption with new, brash, and totally
amoral creatures of the system without
a moral past. The new men grafted,
intrigued, and murdered without com-
punction. The generational break be-
tween the sad, old, corrupted elite
and the new breed of merely criminal
apparatchiks comes out very well in
the book.
The Great Man himself emerges as
a rather ordinary, tedious, and increas-
ingly demented old bully, pretty much
the “grey blurb” of Trotsky’s descrip-
tion without any engaging qualities.
It seems that his daughter has written
yet another footnote to Hannah Arendt’s
thesis about the banality of evil.
The danger emanating from Russia
does not lie in attempts of her rulers
to “spread Communism.” As a living
faith Communism has been dead in
Russia for decades, and nowhere more
so than among the elite. The danger
comes from the discrepancy between
the behaviour of a rather low-level and
amoral oligarchy and a system of
rationalisations which are totally at
variances with the quality of life which
they rationalise. The big lie forces the
oligarchy into a policy whose ultimate
objective is the elimination of truth-
telling and objective reportage from the
planet. The world will be much safer
once the Soviet rulers become explicitly
amoral political freebooters out for the
main chance without addiction to their
ideological clap-trap. The reason for
this is not that it will be only then
that they will cease to try to “impose
Communism.” The reason is, rather,
that it will be only then that they will
be able to cease to lie about imposing
“Communism” and, therefore, cease to
try to replace the real world by a
monumental Potemkin village run by
people very much like Hermann Goer-
ing and A 1 Capone and quite unlike
Karl Marx.
Victim's story
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
The Deserted House. Lydia Chukov-
skaya. Barrie and Rockcliff. $2.30.
STILL THEY COME the moral
writs served on the restless ghosts of
Stalin’s Russia. The 50th anniversary of
the Revolution seems likely to go down
as the year of the survivors’ wake, the
time of the big literary reckoning. Not
only Stalin’s daughter, it seems, but
plenty of others have been pouring out
their secret confessions on paper. This
novel was written by a well-known
Soviet authoress almost 30 years ago;
the MS miraculously survived wars,
purges, terror (when some of its guard-
ians did not), to be brought out of
hiding only now. The writer still cannot
publish it in her own country, but at
least she can print it under her own
name in Paris and in London. At home,
she has recently proved her courage in
other ways, notably in her open letter
against Sholokhov.
“The Deserted House” lies in Kafka
country, but in this case it is not a
manifestation of the mind. It is real.
Or, perhaps, it was built in the mind
after all the mind of one madman,
Stalin. Again and again one gets the
impression from this novel, and from
others, like “The Holy Well” and “The
Taste of Power,” that Stalin saw the
whole of the Russian people only as a
projection of his own state of paranoia.
This simply told story of the doctor’s
widow, Olga Petrovna, must stand as
a memorial for thousands like her. At
the beginning she is a happy patriot,
the efficient head of the typing pool
in a large publishing house, justly proud
of the achievements of her only child,
a brilliant young engineer. At the end
she has nothing: her innocent son is in
prison, her respected boss arrested, her
own job gone, and all her friends have
disappeared one by one.
None of these people is guilty of
any crime; there is no trial, only “con-
fession”; no defence, only prosecution.
The author shows how one woman’s
faith in right, in truth, in justice is
slowly crushed as her world is sucked
up into the processes of an inhuman,
unreasoning machine.
More than any lists of dry statistics,
more than any enumeration of the
hundreds of blameless delegates, the
thousands of loyal army officers, the
outspoken writers and dissenters who
were so senselessly sacrificed, this calm,
unhysterical account of a single per-
sonal tragedy reveals exactly how, in
those years, Russia was brought close
to complete internal disintegration. For
the first time one begins to understand
how Hitler, whom Stalin is said to
have admired and who was in a better
position to know what was going on
than most, could have imagined that his
invasion would be a quick walkover.
The Russian nation, as the author
makes clear between the lines, had
always been ruled by autocrats whom
the Revolution was supposed to have
thrown off. The importance' of “The
Deserted House” is the revelation of
the agonised manner in which the
ordinary Soviet citizen was made gradu-
ally aware that Stalin, too, was nothing
but another tyrant absolute.

he was a judge and judges are usually

Isaacs was obviously a most unusual

influential in action, lhe real point ot
Zelman Cowen’s story, in other words,
is not so much Isaacs the man as what
happened to him and around him. For-
tunately, plenty happened and part of
the value of the book is that it is rarely
a history of Australia, pegged on Isaacs’
life, from the goldrushes to the last
months of the Chifley Government.
This interest even survives Zelman
Cowen’s affidavit-like style. The book
starts: “Isaac Alfred Isaacs was born in
Melbourne on 6 August 1855 and was
the first child . . .” etc. —and one’s heart
sinks. In fact, the following 260 pages
of affidavit are hard to put down.
It is a full biography, covering
Isaacs’ boyhood in Melbourne in the
1850 s and 1860 s, and the influence of
his mother (“my sweet darling blessed
Mammie,’ as he wrote when he was in
his fifties); his marriage and early years
at the Bar, with side interests such as
raising funds for the relief of Russian
Jews and Masonic activities (he became
Grand Registrar of the United Lodge);
his nine years as a Radical and Im-
perialist member of the Victorian
Parliament when as Solicitor-General
he insisted on prosecuting more bank
auditors whom the Attorney-General
had refused to prosecute: he was forced
to resign, but the affair made him
famous; his major role in the Federal
Conventions, despite his humiliation at
not being elected a delegate in Adelaide
(the result according to Alfred Deakin
of a “discreditable plot” inspired by
“personal dislike” of Isaacs); his five
years in Federal politics, including one
year as Attorney-General; his 24
years on the High Court, including
Barton’s feud with him (“I don’t think
there is the least bit of sincerity about
the jewling’s attitude” is a typical piece
from Acting Chief Justice Barton); his
Governor-Generalship; and his contro-
versies about the Constitution and about
Zionism.
The chapters on controversial issues
are the best, and Cowen has used other-
wise unknown or little-known source
material. The account of Isaacs’
appointment as Governor-General is
the best I know of, and Cowen draws
on Scullin’s detailed notes, which he
(Scullin) later gave to Chifley at the
time of the appointment of Sir William
McKell as Governor-General. Scul-
lin’s confrontation with the King is
documented, including his refutation
of the argument that Isaacs should
not be appointed because he had been
in politics: he had been out of politics
for a quarter of a century and the
Governor-General of Northern Ireland
was immersed in politics. Cowen
believes that although the King was
naturally “displeased” that Scullin had
not consulted him before selecting
Isaacs, the King was opposed to the
appointing of any Australian, and of
Isaacs in particular. Isaacs, however,
enjoyed the job with obvious relish,
kept great books of Press cuttings, and
regularly sent off letters of immense
length to the King about his activities.
The other controversies of his later
years were his writing in favor of in-

Clarified Butter. Pure dairy butter with the

doesn’t splutter and foam when it’s melted,
that won’t catch or burn. As Graham Kerr
says, “Clarified Butter brings out the flavour

And, of course, you have to use so little
Clarified Butter—just enough to cover the
bottom of the pan lightly. And you use it at
temperatures much lower than those recom-
mended for other cooking fats and oils. So
protein fibres are cooked much more gently,
food comes to the table so much more

and a great admiration for this extra-
ordinary old man, though it is often
qualified by irritation and sometimes
by anger at his insensitivity and his
dogmatic and relentless judgments on
persons and issues.” But it shows in
detail how Isaacs’ inexhaustible energy-
left its mark on so many departments
of Australian life, where if he was not
a “great man” he was, in Cowen’s
words, a “major figure.” He surely
deserves more in commemoration
than just a place name in Canberra
and an electorate name in Melbourne.
Books in brief
Short novels
Strangers and Graves. Peter Feibleman.
Gollancz. $3.85.
“FOUR VIEWS OF HELL ON
EARTH” would be an alternative
title for this highly individual, very-
personal collection of short novels.
“The Death of Danaus” is a shatter-
ing account of non-feeling, a notoriously
difficult subject, full of traps, into none
of which Peter Feibleman is ever in
danger of falling. By isolating a woman
in her bleak emotional wastes in the
midst of what should be plenty, by
allowing her most terrible, apparently
incomprehensible, actions to speak
loudly for themselves until, finally, the
reader is forced to add up the signs
and admit the total that this true
daughter of Danaus just cannot experi-
ence any feeling the author has
achieved the impossible.
The basically kitschy situation of
“Fever” (the friendship of a lonely 11-
year-old boy and the fat old madam
of a New Orleans brothel) is saved
from any heart-of-gold sentimentality
by its wry, macabre humor. The other
two novellas are both set in the squalor
and ragged grandeur of Spain, as
though the author needed to travel far
to get an authentic perspective for
what may have become, for some,
rather old, unfashionable virtues.
In “On the Coast” the many-stranded
plot revolves about a fisherwoman who
tries to sell the one possession she has
left her honesty and integrity to
save her dying grandson’s life, only
to find these attributes alone have no
commercial value. While the blind
street-corner lottery-ticket seller of
“Eyes” still moves in a protected, un-
touchable aura of pride and dignity,
which his creditors are unable to
pierce, until his good and loving wife
destroys it with the best of intentions.
No joke
Cricket Walkabout. D. J. Mulvaney.
Melbourne University Press. $2.95.
THE FIRST Australian cricket team to
tour England was the all-Aboriginal
side of 1867-68. There have been no
Aborigines in successive teams. This is
the first serious account, though
executed with a light hand, of this
uninhibited team, some of them reminis-
cent in skill of today’s West Indians, all
of them well ahead in high spirits.
However, the author, a Senior Fellow
in Prehistory at the Australian National
University, demonstrates that this team
is by no means the “vaudeville turn”
it has been pictured as in previous
accounts. These were the rough-and-
ready days of the goldrushes and the
cricket was on a par with the era. The
author describes the changing con-
ditions of the game and of the
Aborigines, and of their accidental and
happy coincidence. It is a colorful,
amusing, and at times tragic story of
how the team gets out of Australia
despite official opposition, in England
winning 14, losing 14, and drawing 19
games, entertaining the crowds after
matches with unusual athletic displays,
and in general receiving better treat-
ment than in their own country.
Splendid on people
Open Negative. Cynthia Nolan. Mac-
millan. $5.45.
SEVERAL REVIEWERS have already
kindly pointed out that you can ignore
the first half of Mrs. Nolan’s book and
read the second half. You begin on
page 115, “Alone, in a room of the
world-famous hospital, I lay in bed
and acknowledged a fundamental,
absolute thankfulness; I could rest.”
The first half deals with travels in
the United States by Mrs. Nolan and
her husband, the artist Sidney Nolan,
when she was well on the way toward
real sickness.
The second half deals with her stay
in hospital with tuberculosis. This is
strong, vivid, quite memorable writing.
Mrs. Nolan, surprisingly for someone
who must have a deep preoccupation
with landscape from a painter’s point
of view, cannot write with much con-
viction about the American environ-
ment, but on people she is splendid.
Her gallery of portraits from the tuber-
culosis hospital is rich, varied, and
precise, and, considering how close to
insanity some of her fellow-patients
must have driven her, because it is
precise, it is often oddly sympathetic.

SOMETHING
NEW
WITH GRAHAM KERR
Launching
an attack
on lunch
THE DIETARY HAZARDS of the
business lunch are familiar to most
successful men. Lately, I’ve been mak-
ing some observations among the junior
and middle executive levels what you
might call the ulcer belt —for it is
among this group that ulcer conditions
seem to appear most frequently.
Should the lunch period be used for
business discussions? Does alcohol re-
duce afternoon efficiency? Is it wise
to eat at the desk? Should the board-
room become a restaurant? These are
some of the questions which need to be
faced.
Right off I can say that I completely
disagree with using restaurant luncheons
as an opportunity for business discus-
sions. If business associates get together
for lunch, shop talk is the one thing that
should never be on the menu. When in-
vitations to lunch are not for purely
social reasons, they are usually intended
to soften your defences, to impress you,
or to make time in an already over-
crowded schedule of appointments.
Talking business demands attention
and so does the business of digestion. If
the true objective of the luncheon meet-
ing is business, then digestion is going
to suffer. In turn, if digestion is im-
paired, business sooner or later will
suffer, too.
To the young, fit, aggressive executive
my comments may look like those of a
self-opinionated upstart. His expense
account glows hospitably, he enjoys
good food, good wine, and the excite-
ment of advancing his career. What
does he know, or care, of peptic and
duodenal ulcers?
But the business lunch can develop
into an unbreakable habit. One deal
leads to another, the pressure is on and
the time that should be devoted to eat-
ing is invested in business. It is a bad
investment.
On the average I start work in the
office at 8 a.m. and finish at 7 o’clock.
I tend to eat a good breakfast and stay
at my desk the full 10 to 11 hours. My
food assistant usually cooks one of the
dishes we test for my lunch, it is served
at the desk, and generally takes 20 min-
utes to consume. I am 34 years old,
exactly the right weight, and consider
myself fit. Yet at the end of such a
day I am exhausted, have an aching
back, a crashing headache, and the in-
tellectual responsiveness of a three-year-
old. On the odd occasion that I get out
of the office and walk for at least 20
minutes, all these symptoms vanish.
The 20-minute gallop is taken in lieu
of lunch. With a decent breakfast and
a good dinner, I find lunch unnecessary.
In fact, provided one eats well at both
ends of the day, I think lunch is an
undesirable, fattening, and efficiency-
reducing habit.
And here’s my final attack on lunch.
It is a well-known medical fact that
when food enters the digestive system
blood immediately flows to the area to
assist efficient performance, and this
leaves the brain with less than its nor-
mal quota.
Then there’s the question whether
alcohol reduces afternoon efficiency.
This does depend on the individual, but
generally it dees affect work perfor-
mance. When warmed to body heat,
alcohol gives off vapors that rise to the
frontal area of the brain and act as a
partial local anaesthetic. Hardly an asset
to the decision-making executive.
The degree of anaesthesia obviously
depends on the amount drunk. If you
have to eat lunch, I can see no reason
why the alcoholic content of a single
glass of wine should not be absorbed
by the food. But that is about as much
as the normal system can stand before
the brain becomes partially inopera-
tive.
I have already voted against lunch
entirely. But if breakfast has been
skimped, some protein or food to
generate blood sugar may be required
at midday for the afternoon’s work. But
eating at the desk is absolutely undesir-
able. I’ve admitted doing it myself,
but I still dislike it. I am forced to
test recipes and so I kill three birds
with one tray the recipe, lunch, and,
if it goes on much longer, myself.
Now the boardroom. I’m not against
it becoming a restaurant in fact, I
think it is a good idea. Firstly, it cuts
down travel time to and from the
office to a restaurant. Secondly, if you
select the chef wisely, you can have
an excellent, varied menu entirely to
your taste (of course, I’m talking to
the chairman now; the rest of you may
wish to regard his taste as a spur to
your own advancement). And, finally,
it is an excellent meeting place for
senior executives on a social level with-
out outsiders listening in.
But such a lunch should be con-
ducted strictly within these rules:
• Maximum wine intake, 8 fl. oz.
• No spirits or beer.
• No business discussion of any kind.
Clients must also observe the rules
when invited to attend.
There should be only one light main
dish, high in protein and low in carbo-
hydrate, and fresh fruit, cheese, and
coffee.
Restaurants specialising in luncheons,
if they feel like suing me, can take
comfort in the regrettable fact logic
and lunch don’t have much in common.


LETTERS
Catholic-Communist dialogue
Your article on Communists and
Catholics (8., Nov. 4), Contrives to
extract the maximum of innuendo from
the minimum of evidence. You suggest,
for instance, that there is some kind of
special channel of communication be-
tween the Catholic peace group, “Pax,”
and the Australian Communist Party,
on the ground that the “Tribune” pub-
lished confidential information about
two of the speakers at the recent “Pax”
Convention, as well as sections of Fr.
Kenny’s paper which was not actually-
delivered at the Convention. You also
claim that there have been a number of
meetings between leading Party mem-
bers and Catholic intellectuals from
the “Catholic Worker” and “Pax”
groups. And, finally, you suggest that
Archbishop Knox has an “obvious
antipathy” to Catholic - Communist
dialogue.
With regard to the first innuendo,
had your own reporter been at the
“Pax” Convention in question he, too,
would have been able to find out exactly
the same information about Frs. Kenny
and Marstin as did the “Tribune” rep-
resentative. Your reporter would also,
like his colleague from the “Tribune,”
have been able to obtain a copy of Fr.
Kenny’s undelivered paper, since it
was made available at the Convention.
Your second claim, that there have
been a number of meetings between
"Pax” members and Communists, is,
I suppose, quite true if you count two
meetings as a number. The first meet-
ing was an informal one between a
small group of “Pax” members, who
were preparing papers for the Conven-
tion, and Mr. Rex Mortimer. They
discussed in general terms the question
of Catholic-Communist dialogue.
I might mention that the same group
had, some time before, a similar in-
formal meeting with Dr. Frank Knop-
felmacher. The second meeting that I
know of was again an informal one
between myself and four members of
the Communist Party in order to dis-
cuss Garaudy’s book. I suppose also
that I ought to confess that I am on
speaking terms with a number of Com-
munists and that from time to time
I do speak with them, though these
occasional exchanges can hardly be
called meetings or dialogue.
As for Archbishop Knox’s alleged
antipathy to Catholic - Communist
dialogue, I do not know what the Arch-
bishop’s attitude is and I am willing
to bet that your writer does not, either.
So far as I am aware, Archbishop
Knox censored Fr. Marstin’s paper on
purely theological grounds and not be-
cause it was to be delivered to the
“Pax” Convention. It would, in any
case, be very strange if the Archbishop
were antipathetic to Catholic-Commun-
ist dialogue since this is being prac-
tised under official Church auspices on
the Continent at the present time.
It is a pity that your writer did not
read my article in the “Catholic
Worker” on these initiatives overseas
instead of relying upon a summary in
the “Tribune.” These precedents do
not, of course, prove that Catholic-
Communist dialogue is worthwhile, but
they do at least show that the very
modest, and I think serious and respon-
sible, efforts of the “Pax” group to pro-
mote dialogue are not evidence that we
are crypto-Communists or heretical
Catholics.

Art dealing
A brief reference to Central Street
Gallery in Charles Higham’s article
“Art Dealing ” states that this
gallery is financed by an artist co-
operative and specialises in “Hard-
Edge.”
For the record, Central Street Gal-
lery is totally sponsored by Art Depart-
ment Pty. Ltd., an advertising art ser-
vice, and at no time are exhibiting
painters required to finance the gal-
lery’s activities.
It is not this gallery’s policy to be
exclusively “Hard-Edge” and a resume
of our past exhibitions would indicate
this. Every painter attached to this gal-
lery regards “Hard-Edge” as a meaning-
less blanket generalisation as irrelevant
as referring to “Rectangular” or
“Colored” art.

Portability of pensions
Y’our timely article on portability was
most welcome (8., October 28). The
real issue is that most employers seem
not to be prepared to admit the right
of the employee to the employer’s con-
tributions; yet if there were no super-
annuation, employees would rightly ex-
pect larger salaries.
It is illuminating to quote the ex-
ample of the N.S.W. State Superannua-
tion Fund. Of each $2.25 unit of pen-
sion, the employee contributes 80 cents,
the employer 50 cents, interest 25 cents,
and the employer in addition carries
a deferred liability of 70 cents. On
withdrawal, the employee receives a
refund of his contributions. The em-
ployer’s funded contribution and in-
terest is retained by the Fund, and the
deferred liability is liquidated.
All in all, the Fund benefits greatly
from resignations and much of the sur-
pluses of the Fund are due to the larger
number of withdrawals than expected
(actuaries’ report 1959 and 1964). The
policy of the State Government is to
use surpluses to increase the value of
the unit or to add further benefits. Thus
the contributor who has resigned has
his equity shared among future pen-
sioners;
The apparent acceptance of deferred
liability pension schemes by the Com-
monwealth and State Governments is
another drawback to portability. At
present, on withdrawal, the deferred
liability portion is conveniently erased.
(But surely this is as much the em-
ployee’s as his real salary?) Govern-
ments may be loath to vest pensions or
make them portable if it means increas-
ing their present liability.
Yet another aspect is worth raising:
a comparison of superannuation with
life-assurance endowment policies which
are covered by the Commonwealth
Insurance Act. The Act guarantees a
minimum surrender value which after
a few years matches and then surpasses
the total premiums paid. In the N.S.W.
State Fund, where the employee contri-
butes less than half of the “premium,”
upon “surrender” he receives less than
50 percent of the total “premiums!”
Perhaps the real answer to the port-
ability problem lies in the creation of
a funded national insurance scheme as
in Sweden. This would be more than
a clearing house. If the employer and
the employee were to contribute say
5 percent of salary each, this would be
at least the same as most present
schemes. Employers, of course, could
provide additional benefits.
As an example, instead of the N.S.W.
State Scheme, if employer and employee
contributed equal amounts to a national
fund, the employer (mostly the State
Government) could in addition grant
a pension of 40 cents per unit per week
as a fringe benefit. This would be the
same cost as the present scheme to both
employer and employee, but would have
the advantage of being fully portable.
People should be assured of building
their retirement equity as they grow
older and move from job to job. This
would not only be a great social service
but would save the Commonwealth the
cost of present pensions (over $450 mil-
lion per annum). In addition, a national
fund would be a huge source of capital
for development.

Provocation
In the photo with the article “How-
to keep one-up on de Gaulle” (8., Nov.
4), whereas both Wilson and Kiesinger
have four wine glasses apiece, Brown
has nought but a wistful look. Con-
tinual provocation of this kind would
induce any man to untimely paranoic
outbursts.
