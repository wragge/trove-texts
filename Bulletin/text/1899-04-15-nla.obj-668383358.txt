THE FINER SPIRIT.
I am the strength of all the dead,
The wisdom and the goodlihead
And the heart of what they did and said.
I am the beauty that hath stood
Bodied, like a beatitude,
In soft, calamitous womanhood
From the beginning. And the Rest
Of saints am I, and all the blest
Rapture of bosoms babes have prest.

THE INQUEST.
Not labour kills us ; no, nor joy t
The incredulity and frown,
The interference and annoy,
The small attritions wear us down.
The little gnat-like buzzings shrill,
The hurdy-gurdies of the street,
The common curses of the will—
These wrap the cerements round our feet.
And more than all, the look askance
Of loving souls that cannot gauge
The numbing touch of circumstance^
The heavy toll of heritage.
It is not Death, but Life that slays:
The night less mountainously lies
Upon our lids than foolish day’s
Importunate futilities.
F. B. Money-Coutta.
A TAUNT.
In the oldest wood I know a brooklet
That bubbles over stones and roots.
And ripples out of hollow places,
Like music out of flutes.
There creeps the pungent breath of cedars,
Rich coolness wraps the air about,
Whilst through clear pools electric flashes
Betray the watchful trout.
I know where wild things lurk and linger,
In groves as gray and grand as Time ;
I know where God has Written poems
Too strong for words or rhyme.
Gome, let us go, each pulse is precious,
Coine, ere the day has lost its dawn ;
And you shall quaff life’s finest essence
From primal flagons drawn !
Just for a day slip off the tether
Of hothouse wants, and dare to be
A child of Nature, strong and simple,
Out in the woods with me.
Out in the woods, on freedom’s bosom,
We shall be worthy sons of men,
Bred of remotest sires who bearded
The satyr in his den.
Come, just a sip of the wild man’s nectar
Shall show you life from a point of view
As old as the oldest stones of the mountains,
And yet as fresh as dew !
Supple joints and bulging muscles,
Sinews taut as the chords of a harp,
Veins full-flushed, eyes clear as water,
And all the senses sharp.
Who was Shakespeare ? Where is 11 nner?
Can Milton leap, or dance, or run ?
Should you care to cast a fly with Walton ?
Do you envy Napoleon ?
What of this lore of buried thinkers?
What of these classic deaths and heights ?
Better one strong, bright, living creature
Than a myriad trilobites !
Ah, I see you scoff at my meaning,
You flaccid, indolent bookworm, you !
What would you give for my good digestion
And my nerve-cords sound and true ?
Maurice Thompson.
The Heal Australian.
THE interest of “The Native Tribes
of Central Australia,” by Baldwin
Spencer and F. J. Gillen (Lond.,
Macmillan, 1899) would in any case
be more scientific than literary. But the
book could with great advantage have
been made much more literary than it
is. It is a study of the aboriginal tribes
inhabiting Central Australia—their ways of
life, customs, ceremonies, and superstitions ;
and the authors—one a professor of biology,
the other a S.A. magistrate—have worked
hai'd in the light of special experience, and
have amassed a wealth of detail-information,
much of it new, most of it not previously set-
down so accurately. But their book rambles
too much: the information is often not
clearly presented : the matter wants a more
minute and more systematic classification—
wants re-arranging by a stronger brain, like
the brain which works to make books such
as Geddes and Thomson’s “Evolution of
Sex marvels of lucid force. Spencer and
Gillen s book naturally invites comparison
with Dr. Roth’s recent and similar study of
Queensland tribes, and the comparison is often
in favor of Dr. Roth. Where S. and G. are
loose he is tense ; where they fail to classify,
he gives head and sub-head, section and. sub-
section. Dr. Roth’s method is a great help
to the reader, who has his neck, as it were,
severed by one blow instead of mangled by
half-a-dozen; and anybody who has been
decapitated both ways will cheer for the
single-stroke executioner.
* * * *
In the second place, Spencer and Gillen’s
rambling book is a slow book-—almost tedious.
Ihe authors not only write commonplace
English, but they often write withoutanysense
of the dramatic and picturesque value of the
facts they describe, or without any power of
dramatically and picturesquely presenting
their facts in words. That is a great draw-
back, even from the scientific point of view
For the man of science, like every other
reader, wants his mental food chewed and
salivated, pepsined and diastased, before he
swallows it. He wants digestion made as
short and easy a process as possible ; for
he has no time to waste. Thus an author
who sees so clearly, and writes so forcibly,
that his subject, and his statements, and the
resultant analogies and deductions, can be
assimilated with the least possible expendi-
ture of energy, is as commendable in science
as in literature. The old notion that science
was entitled to be dull and dryasdust has
gone to limbo : people with brains recognise
with Buckle that style is half the author’s :
battle, and see that if Herbert Spencer would
write thrice as well he would have twice his
present value. Thus it is pity that ail the
time, all the labour, which Spencer and
Gillen have spent in a most curious and in-
teresting environment have furnished
their book with few curious and inter-
esting passages. Ethnologically, of course,
they are full of interest; though even ethno-
logically they too often confine themselves
to a mere record of facts. “ A mere record
of facts ’ —that is good ; but Spencer and
Gillen’s book might so easily have been
better.
• * • *
It is worth while stressing the point of
style a little farther, so that other Australian
authors with a burden to deliver may keep
in mind that the load is scarcely more import-
ant than the vehicle—since it is the vehicle
which carries the load. Let the Spencer-
Gillen volume open where it will pace
320
After midnight there was performed the Qua-
hara Akakia (plum-tree), of a place called Iliakilia
in the Waterhouse Range. This was acted by four
men, who were respectively Purula and honey-ant
totem; Purula and “native-pheasant”; Purula
and white bat ; Bulthara and illonka. First of all
one man came up to where the audience was sitting
by the Parra. He pretended to knock plums
down and to eat them, and after a short time he
sat down amongst the audience. Then two others
came up, one of whom remained standing while
he knocked down imaginary plums, which were
eaten by the other man, who seated himself on the
ground. This over, both of the men went and
joined the audience, and the fourth man came and
went through the same pretence of eating plums.
* * • 4
Now, this matter is dead: there is no
picture: it costs the reader a mental effort
to envisage the scene and drag its meaning
and colour from the words ; and this mental
effort has to be repeated on nearly every page
of the Spencer-Gillen book. But in that night
in the Central Australian desert, and in t'he
voices of the night; in the scene, dark or lit
by camp-fires; in the faces and figures of
actors and audience ; in the atmosphere of
the whole ; —there must have been material
for fresh emotion and graphic description.
If Spencer and Gillen had presented the
scene as they saw it, or as clear, alert minds
might ha ye felt it—if they had made it live :
then the value of their transferred impres-
sion would have increased a hundredfold,
even scientifically. For only life rouses
and begets life ; and from dead words, as
fi’om dead seeds, nothing germinates. What
would a dozen bright journalists of the
Steevens type have made of the plum-tree
ceremony ? Something infinitely more in-
teresting and valuable—even scientifically ;
for they could see and show the looks and
hearts of the participators. But —if Spencer
and Gillen had devoted time and space to
subordinate incidents, their hook would
have run to half-a-dozen volumes ? So
much the better, if the volumes were
good. As it is, they have erected a
warehouse of facts which should be visited
by everyone who wants to understand the
ways and whys of Australian natives. Yet,
with a little literary architecture, their ware-
house might have been a palace—so built
that it would attract visitors who will never
dream of entering the barn.
* » • *
Messrs. Spencer and Gillen have many
facts about totemism in Central Australia
but to the reason or origin of totemism we
come no nearer. They agree with Dr. Roth
that the practice of sub-incision was not
adopted to limit population ; but demur to
his theory of an imitative rite. Their chap-
ter on social organisation and tribal re-
lationships exhausts the subject for their
sphere. They report that the Central
Australian is never in a hurry ; that
he occasionally employs women doctors;
and that his costume when anybody is
initiated into his “lodge” would make a
Freemason split with envy. And Spencer
and Gillen report many other things of
moment: the objection here taken is only to
their literary style, and in some measure to
their system or lack of it : for information
they are an encyclopaedia and an art gallery
and a museum put together. Many photo-
graphs add value to their book, though in
some cases colored pictures are wanted to
convey the full idea. Apparently the Cen-
tral Australian has not the Red Indian’s
objection to the camera. To make up for
one denounced quotation, several com-
mended quotations follow.
* * * *
The Central Australian Secures a Divorce—
and a Shooting Star.
. If a woman, runs away from her husband and he
is unable to recover her, he and his friends—that
is, men of his local group--assemble at a secluded
spot where a man skilled in magic draws upon the
surface of a small patch of ground, which has been
cleared and smoothed down for the purpose, a
rough diagram . . . intended to represent the
figure of the woman lying down on her back.
It is called [curiously] Aura, a term which has
much the same significance as the word emblem.
While the drawing is being made, and throughout
the whole proceedings, low chants are sung, the
burden of which is an exhortation to the Ariing-
quiltha [or evil spirit] to go out and enter her
body and dry up all of her fat. When the draw-
ing is done, a piece of green bark is placed [at a
spot near where the heart of the woman should
be]. This is supposed to represent the spirit
part of the woman, and then all the men
who are present stick into it a number of
miniature spears, which have been made for the
purpose and have been “sung.” The spears with
the bark into which they are fixed are then flung
as far as they can be thrown in the direction in
which the woman is supposed to be. The party
now returns to camp, and sooner or later, very
often after the lapse of a considerable time, the
woman’s fat dries up, she dies, and her ulthana,
or spirit, appears in the sky in the form of a
shooting-star.

The Central Australian Covets His Neigh-
bour’s Wife, and Catches Her.
-A man belonging to a group about 45 miles
away, to the west of Alice Springs, persuaded a
woman belonging to a man of the latter group to
run away with him from her husband, and the
latter, though he gave chase, could not capture the
runaway wife. The elopers went away to the
south and lived for a year in a distant group, re-
turning finally to Alice Springs, accompanied by
some of the man’s friends. On arrival at the
latter place the man went to the UTic/uiijci, or
men s camp, and the woman to the Erlukwirra, or
women s camp. At the Ungunya a long discussion
took place, during which the pros and cons of the
case were discussed, the two men most interested
remaining silent. After some time the man
who had taken the woman got up, . and,
taking with him some spears and a‘ shield’
walked out to a clear space some little dis-
tance from the camp and shouted to the ag-
grieved ma v n, who remained sitting, “ Arakutya
thale iknukunja yinga iltai, ” which meant, “I
took your woman ; come and growl ! ” There-
upon the man got up, and, standing some dis-
tance off, threw spears and boomerangs at the first
man, who skilfully guarded himself with his
shield but made no-attempt to retaliate. When
all had been thrown he rushed into close quarters
with his enemy, and began attempting to out the
thighs of the latter, and his back also with a large
stone knife, the attacked man doing his Best to
guard himself, but not again attempting to retali-
ate. After a time the onlookers thought"' that
enough had been done, and calling out loudly
‘\kutta impara ” —which means “Enough, leave
him ! dragged the two apart. The women
meanwhile had all assembled ; and the aggrieved
man, walking over to where his erstwhile wife was
standing, caught hold of her and cut her about
the legs and body, avoiding, however, any vital
part. Then, leaving her, he waved his knife in
the air and started off for the camp, shouting
“ Untantimma atnina, ipminja tcuta, ipminja
kuta” (“You keep together ; I throw away, I
throw away ”). After having renounced her in
this way, she became the property of the man
with whom she had eloped.
* « * *
The Central Australian Goes Kurdaitcha.
Amongst the Central Australian natives there
is no such thing as belief in natural death ; how-
ever old or decrepit a man or woman may be when
this takes place, it is at once supposed that it has
been brought about by the magic influence of some
enemy, and in the normal condition of the tribe
the death of one individual is followed by the
murder of someone else, who is supposed to be
guilty of having caused the death. . . . When it
is decided who is guilty, a council of the old men
of the group to which the dead man belonged is
held, and, if it be decided that vengeance is to be
exacted by means of a Kurdaitcha party, then the
man who is to play this part is chosen. The name
Kurdaitcha is applied to the latter, and he wears
the shoes to which, by white men, the name of
Kurdaitcha shoes has been given. In the'North,
the native name for them is Interlinia, and in the
South Intathurta.
These shoes have the form of a thick pad of emu
feathers matted together with human blood drawn
from the arm of some young man. They are so
ingeniously made, however, that the use of any-
thing like blood in their construction would never
be suspected ; indeed, it is difficult to detect, even
with the shoes in one’s hands, how the feathers
are matted into such a compact mass without ap-
parently the use of anything like stitching. On
the upper surface is a network of human hair
string made from the hair of any living man or
woman—it does not in the least signify who the
individual is—and in the middle of the network is
a hole through which the foot passes and across
which stretches a cord made of several strands of
hair string twisted together. No woman or child
may see them, and, they are kept wrapped up in skin
or else placed for safety in the sacred storehouse
along with the Churinga. It is said that they may
be used more than once, but the nature of the
shoe is such that it could not last more than one
journey over the hard ground characteristic of the
interior.
Before a man may wear the shoes he has to sub-
mit to a most painful ordeal. A stone is heated
to redness, and then applied to the ball of the
small toe of either foot, it does not matter which,
until, as the natives say, the joint is softened’
when, with a sudden jerk, the toe is pulled out-
wards and the joint thus dislocated. ... In cor-
respondence with this is the fact that the true
Kurdaitcha shoe has, at one side, a small opening
made in the hair network through which the toe
is thrust.
Each Kurdaitcha man when going on his errand
is accompanied by a medicine man, and the two
men are rubbed over with charcoal—black being
in the Arunto tribe the color associated ivith
magic—and decorated with bands of white down.
The hair of both men is tied up behind and a
small, conical helmet of twigs is fastened on with
hair-string. The Kurdaitcha has lines of down
passing across the front of the helmet, down the
side of the face and front of the body and legs as
far as the knees. The medicine man has a median
line running from the top of the helmet to the tip
of his nose; another curved line meeting this at
both ends encloses the eye of each side; and on
the body a broad band of charcoal runs across
from shoulder to shoulder and downwards till, at
the level of the sternum, it divides into two, one
passing on either side of the mid line and so on
as far down as the knee. The bands are outlined
with white down, and, as the pattern is a constant
one, the Kurdaitcha man can always be distin-
guished from the medicine man.
Both of the men wear the interlinia or shoes
which, when thus in use, are decorated with lines
of white and pink down, and, while they are being
put on and attached to the feet and legs with
human hair-string, the Kurdaitcha sings
“ Interlinia turlaa attipa,
Interlinia attipa,”
which literally translated- means “ Interlinia to
me hold fast, interlinia hold fast. ” There is not,
either at the making or at the putting on of the
shoes, anything in the way of an incantation be-
yond this simple one.
Followed by the medicine man the Kurdaitcha
takes the lead until the enemy is sighted. Then the
medicine man falls into the rear, while the Kurd-
aitcha stealthily creeps forward towards his quarry
an'd, suddenly rising up, spears him before he is
aware of the presence of an enemy. Both medi-
cine-man and Kurdaitcha have meanwhile put the
sacred Churinga between their teeth, and when
they are thus armed the spear cannot fail to strike
the victim. As soon as this is done the Kur-
daitcha man goes-away to some, little distance
from the fallen man, and from which he cannot
see the operations of the medicineman, who now
approaches and performs his share in the work.
By aid of his magic powers arid by means, of the
Atnongara stones he heals the victim. These At-
nongara stones are small crystalline structures
which every medicine-in an is supposed to be
able to produce at will from his own body,
throughout which it' is believed that they are
distributed—in fact, it is the possession of
these stones which gives to the medicine-
man his virtue. Into the spear-wound he rubs
a white, greasy substance called Ernia, which'he
obtains by pressure of the skin glands on the out-
side of the nostril. After all external traces of the
wound have disappeared he goes quietly away and,
together with the Kurdaitcha man, returns to his
own country. Having been touched by the
Atnongara stones, the victim returns to life,bint is
completely ignorant of all that has taken place.
He returns to camp and in a short time sickens
and dies. His death is-attributed to Kurdaitcha
or to .some other form of magic influence, but no
one will be able to trace the tracks of the Kur-

matter of common experience, but the “ why and wherefore,”
are subjects of knowledge to the few only. In spite of the
general recognition of the immense importance of this

ignorance prevails. There is, it is true, a growing feeling
with mothers that

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Westralkn Government has made an
ass of itself as usual. It doubled the rate of com-
mission on P.O. orders to stop the outflow of
money—the small sums which the miner sends to
his wife and children in S.A., or Victoria,
or N.S.W. The Forrest Ministry was convinced
that this would make the miner keep his money
in the country and let the old woman starve, but
as it quite forgot to put a corresponding stamp-
duty on bank-drafts the cash went through the
banks instead, and the P.O. revenue went all to
pieces. And now the Forrest Ministry, having
dropped to this obvious fact when it is too late,
has reduced its rates again in hopes of getting the
lost business back again, and has given up all
hope of stopping the outflow.
Farewell!
Farewell! The memories we share are sweet,
And yet so few.
Thrice only have we chanced to meet,
Just I and you.
Ah, well! farewell! The short, sweet time has
fled;
We say adieu.
The Autumn days, so bright, so soon are dead
For me and you.
Goodbye, but once more hold my hand —
The clasp is true ;
Look once more in my eyes as here we stand,
Just I and you.
Farewell! and now with memories of the past,
And our adieu,
A kiss, and that the very first and last
For me and you.
The first and last! Ah, well, dear lass,
Between us two
Lies Love afraid, and so the dream must pass
For me and you !
A. LEO WATTS .
A Ballade of the Hoad.
When.the drums are beating within the breast.
When the heart is high and the pulse is hale ;
When the tongue is ready with genial jest,
And we leave the town as a dreary gaol,
When we jeer at the jog of the sober snail,
And the load is light that our shoulders bear—
Oh ! the music swells on the morning gale,
And we’d fiddle a smile on the face of Care.
When the skies are dun and the birds at rest,
And the world is loud in a weary wail ;
When the brain is dull and the heart opprest,
And the road before is a dusty trail.
His breast is girt with a hero’s mail,
His soul is ready to do and dare,
Who can lift a tune when his comrades quail
And fiddle a smile on the face ot Care !
When the wind is hot from the drowsy West,
And the junk is hard as a seasoned rail,
When the air is black with the winged pest,
When the water’s scant and the damper’s stale,
It’s meat and drink to the man that’s frail
To turn to a brother who won't despair,
To feel: “ This fellow—he can't say ‘ Fail ’ —
He’d fiddle a smile on the face of Care ! ”
ENVOI.
In a weeping world it hath more avail
Than the grandest hymn or the deepest prayer,
This power to laugh at the craven tale
And fiddle a smile on the face of Care !
Q.
P. LUFTIG.
Irony.
All night a great wind blew across the land,
Come fresh from wild and salty seas,
With many voices loud and low
Appealing to the sympathies
Of those with whom long, long ago
It had been friends, but who
Had lost the way to know and understand
Its weird and tearless woe.
A sleeper drawn from ancient fancies, stirred,
Breathed strangely in a deep unrest
As though his heart were choked with grief ;
The moon down-stealing in the west
Threw every move of limb and leaf
Upon his blind. Now this
Was he the wind sought wildly—had he heard —
Alas, the friend in need was deaf !
All time a great thought wandered round the
world
Naked and breathing loveliness,
Seeking in alien souls a home
But thwarted always, knocking no less
At every door, yet forced to roam
A wonder unexpressed ;
A sense of strangeness as of wings unfurled
Hovered at times o’er some.
He heard the knocking at the inner door;
He saw her face a light intense
And stood amazed, irresolute.
“ Now, thou who hast the poet-sense
In song serene and absolute
Proclaim my hidden worth.”
He sobbed, she drooped her wings. . . Woe ever-
more !
The chosen mind was mute.

to d ink Lime-Fruit Juice whenever and wherever
they list. It is a far more wholesome drink than
any form of Alcohol.”

IT was in the summer of 1778, Wash-
ington, with his army ever active,
determined to oppose the British
general, Sir Henry Clinton, who, having
evacuated Philadelphia, was retreating
through New Jersey on New York. The
forces met on 28th June at Monmouth.
La Fayette conducted the attack. The
heat was so intense that some refused to
fight, and many fell dead from exposure
to the sun’s rays. Both sides fought
desperately. As the day waned, and the
flagging spirits of La Fayette’s soldiers
were at a low ebb, a strange sight aroused
them. Marching with drum and fife
was an old man, Jeremiah Wynton, and
his son, and grandson. The old father,
with silvery flowing locks, sturdily strode
through the field. The son with ban-
daged head fifing lustily, the youth,
catching the spirit of his grandsire, rolled
out with him the soul-inspiring rattle of
the drum. Father, son, and grandson
had accompanied the troops as volunteers,
and were ever in the forefront of the
fight. The fierce light of battle was in
their eyes, they knew no fear, and many
a wild cheer arose, as on that fateful
day Yankee Doodle was heard as never
was heard before or since.

A Plaint from Victoria.
The Insurance and Banking Record (pub-
lished in Melbourne) in its last issue prints
a solemn and low-spirited article about the
want of any notable increase in Victoria’s
population. In the last eight years Victoria,
if the estimates are reasonably reliable,
shows the smallest percentage of increase
among the Seven Provinces. Of course the
estimates, barring those of Maoriland and
Tasmania, are not wholly reliable ; in these
two provinces all arrivals and departures are
by sea, and all sea-passengers are carefully
counted, except stowaways and lunatics who
depart in skiffs, but in the mainland pro-
vinces there is a constant drift of land-
pilgrims back and forward over the borders,
and of them the record is never remarkable
for its accuracy. Still it is probable that
official guesses show some semblance to
the real state of things, and by these esti-
mates Victoria’s population, since the ’9l
census, has shown the smallest advance.
On this subject the Record wails as follows :
It is next to imposible to prescribe means by which
population can be induced to return to Victoria under
conditions affording a tolerable prospect of permanency.
The capital (Melbourne) does not want to add to the large
proportion of its only partially-employed and poorly-paid
inhabitants, for it alread\ T contains very nearly 40 per
cent, of the population of Victoria. Its magnificence and
marvellousness may be conceded, but there is no need to
augment its misery. If, therefore, Melbourne cannot
find employment for a larger population, and if rural
development continues to be slow, what remains to be
done ? Any suggestion that can be offered will be un-
palatable. The public expenditure, and with it taxation,
ought to be reduced in the most drastic fashion to bring
them into harmony with the circumstances of the people,
and to free money for private enterprise. But the civil-
servants, who constitute a formidable proportion of the
electors, are antagonistic to a reduction of expenditure,
while the Protectionist party would strongly object to a
reduction of Customs duties. Going further, it may be
urged that the administration of the Treasury is repelling
to all owners of capital, whether large or small, and that
if capital is to be retained in Victoria reform is necessary.
* • » *
This is the sort of case where all the wild-
eyed people who know exactly how to put
the whole world right with their one nostrum
come in. Therefore, the Single-taxer reckons
that the way to make things boom again in
Victoria is to put all the taxation on land, and
let the money-lender and publican and im-
porter and jerry-builder and banker and
other financial magnates go free. And the
importer is quite sure that lots of calico im-
ported free of duty would make the popula-
tion multiply amazingly. And the promis-
cuous Fat Man assumes that all that is wanted
is the abolition of the income-tax which
annoys him personally ; and the Age holds
that what is required is lots of borrowed
money and new public works. Also, it is
urged in certain quarters of great stomach-
circumference that the minimum wage and
Labor legislation generally are the causes of
the whole trouble, and that with long enough
hours and small enough wages all would be
well. The Bulletin doesn’t know exactly
whether increased population is so great a
blessing as to be worth all this row. Yet
the cause of Victoria’s present situation
seems sufficiently visible to the naked eye,
provided the eye has an unbiassed intel-
ligence behind it.
• * * *
Victoria has been, for the last 30 or 40
years, a phenomenon among the Austra-
lasian States. In proportion to its area its
population is even now twice that of Maori-
land and Tasmania, 3t? times that of New
South Wales, 20 times that of Queensland,
over 30 times that of South Australia, and
about 100 times that of Westralia. As
things go in Australasia it is a frightfully
overcrowded little corner of a huge, empty
land. To make things equal, and leaving
out all considerations of the age of the
various provinces, New South Wales should
have 4,000,000 people, and Tasmania
350,000, and Maoriland 1,500,000, and
Queensland 9,000,000 to place them on
Victoria’s level. Overcrowding is a relative
term, but in a small way Victoria is to the
rest of Australia what Britain is to Aus-
tralia in a larger way —the parent State
which supplies them with population.
Because of the extra density of population,
agricultural land is dearer than anywhere
else in Australasia ; soil that costs £8 an
acre in many parts of Victoria is no better,
and no better situated, than earth that can
be obtained in New South Wales for half
the money, or in South Australia for per-
haps less than half. Therefore there is a
powerful inducement for new agriculturists
with little capital to make for the adjacent
provinces. There is very little State land of
any value left to be sold cheaply in the small
province, while there is still a good deal in
the large ones adjacent, which is another
reason why the new agriculturist with little
money should go to the other side of the
border.
m m m m
By primary industries—agricultural, pas-
toral, mining, dairying, fruit-growing, &c.—
Victoria manages to drag out £lB4 worth of
produce per annum for every square mile of
its surface. Maoriland and Tasmania make
the next best showing. New South Wales
only produces £B2 worth, and South Australia
less than £6 worth. This is another evidence
that Victoria is overcrowded by comparison
with its neighbors. It has only a little more
than half the annual mineral production of
New South Wales, which is a natural dis-
advantage'that is beyond all visible remedy.
And in late years —the years when popu-
lation has made such slow progress—Vic-
toria has lacked the artificial stimulus of
great importations of borrowed money. The
borrowed money expended during recent
years in New South Wales has been sufficient,
on an average, to continuously support
18,000 men and their wives and families ; in
South Australia it has been sufficient to
maintain about 5500 and their families ; in
Victoria only about 1800. And, whatever
the after-consequences may be, there is no
doubt that the country which borrows plenti-
fully and darns the consequences can get
increase of population while the borrowed
money is being expended, just as, other
things being equal, the man who borrows
money and spends it can enjoy more luxury,
while he is spending it, than the man who
doesn’t borrow. And if one province is able,
through its borrowing, to offer a large amount
of profitable or unprofitable work at building
things which are or are not wanted, or at
digging large holes in the ground and filling
them up again, and another province, which
has been doing the same thing, suddenly
leaves off, that floating section of the popu-
lation which has lived on such work is
always liable to leave the latter province and
make for the former. Victoria left off pour-
ing out borrowed money just as Westralia
commenced. Therefore, that part of the
Vic. populace which was neither agricultural,
pastoral, manufacturing, mining, nor com-
mercial—the section which was' created by
the lavish borrowing of the Gillies era, and
which lived on public works mostly
gathered up its swag and lighted out for the
sunset.
* * * *
Therefore, when a certain angry fragment
of the Melbourne press rises up to ask why
Victoria’s population hasn’t increased much
in the last seven or eight years, it asks, in
The Bulletin’s opinion, a very easy conun-
drum. Victoria suddenly left off finding
constant support for about 90,000 or
100,000 people (counting in men, women, and
children) by building railways, &c., with bor-
rowed money, because it found that railway-
building with borrowed money, in a very
small state, couldn’t go on at a furious
pace for ever. If the other provinces had
left off at the same time things would
probably have been about equal and no
exodus would have ensued ; as they didn’t
much of the railway-building part of the
community went west. Despite its small
size Victoria supports a far larger agricultural
and manufacturing population than any—
even the largest and most populous —of its
neighbors, but neither agriculture nor manu-
factures could find immediate employment
for all that extra population which the
railway-building drunk of the 80’s gathered
into Victoria, and which the sobering-up of
the 90's necessarily dispersed again. But
when that same indignant fragment of the
Melbourne press points to the increase of
population in New South Wales and asks
why its own Government doesn’t “ do some-
thing ” to make Victoria hold more people
every year to the same extent, it opens up a
very large and very foolish question.
m * * *
Obviously if Victoria will borrow as much
as New South Wales does, and will find
s imewhere another 220,000 square miles
of land to settle farmers and squatters upon,
and discover mines equal to those of New
South Wales, and get as large a land revenue,
there is no reason why it shouldn’t increase
in the same proportion. If it can’t do that,
its only other chance is to make its small
and, by comparison, grievously overcrowded
territory four times as attractive as the place
across the border. Freetrade won’t produce
the desired effect; the only reasonable
assumption is that a tariff similar to that of
New South Wales would put its manu-
factures, in proportion to population, on the
New South Wales level, and thereby throw
between 5 00 and 8000 people and their
dependents out of work. It can’t be done
by borrowing money and building railways
on a huge scale—no sane individual would
try to put as much railway on 87,000 square
miles as on 310,000. It can’t be done either
by encouraging agricultural immigrants on a
big scale, for the small province hasn’t the
land to settle them on that the larger
ones still possess. For many years
Victoria, partly by luck, largely by
amazing energy, managed to keep far ahead
in wealth and population of all the other
mainland provinces, the smallest of which
is nearly four times its size, but the pro-
cess can’t go on for ever. And the papers
that want to know why the Government
doesn’t maki the process go on whether it
will or not are asking something very large.
* * * *
Still there is abundant room for expan-
sion, though on a smaller scale than formerly.
As the easy process of attracting new agri-
cultural settlers by selling them State lands
cheaply is practically ended, because there is
little good land left to sell, the obvious course
is to make the population sit closer. As
huge landholders insist on keeping great
areas practically vacant in an overcrowded
province, the State must needs lay compul-
sory hands on their big estates and cut them
up for closer settlement. This will make
more room for agricultural population.
It wants to shut down hard on every
mining - shepherd who holds areas of
auriferous land unworked, and thus make
more room for mining population. It
wants an all-round land-tax, instead of the
poor apology now existing, and then it can
build railways with the proceeds and thus
make an opening for population in the
mallee country and in Eastern Gippsland,
Where there is still vacant space of a kind,
but space that is at present inaccessible. If
the most crowded place in Australia wants
to keep on multiplying population in any-
thing like the same ratio as its comparatively
empty neighbors, then it must take extra
vigorous measures to find room for the new
people, and the obvious way to do that is to
shut down hard on the gentleman who is
occupying more than his share of room now.
And with Victoria’s protective tariff there is
room for great increase in the manufacturing
population. But the assumption that Vic-
toria can keep multiplying population in the
same way as the larger provinces are doing,
by the same policy, is absurd ; it is merely
assuming that because a pint will fill a pint
mug it should fill a quart pot equally well.
Briggs and Kelly.
To which The Bulletin says Amen :
Some men have all the luck. For, instance, there is
Michael Henry Kelly, tried last week at Darlinghurst
for the murder of Maria Flynn, the woman who fooled
him. Kelly was tried on the day after the hanging, at
Darlinghurst, of Briggs, for shooting the woman who
had fooled him,. Broadly speaking, there was very little
difference between the two cases, and where a difference
existed, it was not all in Mr. Kelly’s favor. Both shoot-
ings were more or less prompted by erotic furor and
jealousy ; but there was much more' squalid sordidness
and material motive in Kelly’s murder, judging by his own
admissions, than there was in that of Briggs. The latter,
a great big softy full of red blood, went daft—clean off his
miserable head, despite anything that may be said to the
contrary—over a slender little Eurasian woman with
glittering eyes and teeth and hair, the sort of girl who,
though he could have almost put her in his pocket or
carried two like her under each arm, could yet lash him
to madness with a toss of her little head or a curl of her
pretty lips. She did lash him to madness—anyhow,
Briggs got mad over her, and, taking a revolver]! slew
both her and her old grandmother, whom he blamed for
having counselled her to throw him over. The jury
found Briggs guilty, and did not even recommend him to
mercy ; so this mad fool was hanged. And on
the same gallows were also hanged, to all social
intents and purposes, his decent-living old father and
his loving sisters and the mother who gave him birth.
This in order to teach men tiger-mad from love that they
must not kill!
In the case of Briggs, the giant of baby intellect who
used to discourse at large to his fellow-employbs, at all
times and seasons, on what a beauty his Maggie was and
how he loved her, there was, it must be admitted, some
sentiment; but there was not much sentiment in the
case of Michael Henry Kelly, who also avenged his
alleged wrongs, whatever they were, with a revolver
which he deliberately took with him for the purpose—if
not for the purpose, then for what other purpose ? The
burden of Kelly’s song was not how he had loved
Maria Flynn— his plaint as disclosed to the police
and reporters was how angry he was at being swindled of
money ; also he was determined to get back his engage-
ment-ring—or rather, he explained, he didn’t so much
want the ring as the money it had cost him. Anyhow,
Kelly went to interview Miss Flynn, and after an alter-
cation chased her round and shot her—once, twice,
thrice. And she died ; but, whereas Briggs is hanged
and his corpse sent home as an Easter offering to his old
mother, Kelly (the man who also deliberately put a pistol
in his pocket to settle accounts with a recalcitrant
woman) is adjudged guilty of manslaughter only and gets
seven years—which means about five if he behaves him-
self in gaol.
There may be differences between the two cases other
than those here pointed out, but the line of demarcation
between the guilt of Kelly and the guilt of Briggs is far
too fine to justify one man getting five years and the
other all eternity. The inequality of the alleged justice
meted out in the two cases is absolutely appalling—but it
is easily accounted for. In the first place, both were
actuated by uncontrollable influences, which the law (as
Acting-Justice O’Connor explained)doesn’t recognise, but
the Kelly jury was evidently taught by the fate of Briggs
not to trust to the finicking distinctions of lawyers and
official medicoes. There would, probably, have been no-
public agitation on Kelly’s behalf, as everybody would
be too tired and disappointed over the previous case; so,
the jury very sensibly decided to dole out its own mercy.
Also, Kelly was lucky in not having shot so young and:
pretty a girl as Briggs did, and in being tried in a much,
more Irish (which is to say sympathetic) atmosphere.
The mellifluous barrister Moriarty, instructed by Crick,
made the very best of the defence, and Acting-Justice •
O’Connor in his charge to the jury, though clearly point-
ing out what the law on the subject was, em-
phasised the fact that it was in their power to save the
man’s life. They did save his life ; and how, after all is
over, how many people are there in the community who,
if they had to vote on the question, would not, were it.
possible, save Briggs from the scaffold? If Briggs
deserved hanging, so did Kelly —while the law remains.
as it is.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Kingston as a Tory.
S.A. Premier Kingston ought to be a splendid)
man for a political enemy to cock-shy at in a
general election. For he is always doing some-
thing vigorously ; and, as a general thing, the .
more a man does the of be tier he is likely to go ,
wrong, and the more vigor he puts into his .
work the more attention he is likely to get.
And even if he doesn’t go wrong he gives his .
enemy more chances to misrepresent him. But
not only does Kingston keep moving ; he has.
been doing it far longer than any previous S.A.
Premier. Yet, notwithstanding these things,,
and notwithstanding that he packed his policy-
speech with debatable subjects (theoretically
debatable, anyhow), and threw out a chal-
lenge to Conservative critics every minute'
or two, his enemies clearly don’t know
where or how to begin ; and they have'
been mostly content to cry vaguely that “it
means ruin.” The way of the Oppositionist in
S.A. is hard, though ; for adult suffrage pre-
vails there, and the only way to overcome the
man who is “in ” is to show that the man who
is “ out” is more Liberal and progressive than
the other is ; and, as the Conservatives can’t
attempt that in this case, their only hope is to
show, not that Kingston isn’t so Liberal as
they are, but that he isn’t so Liberal as he says
he is. In the first place, he hasn’t always be-
lieved in the things he believes in now, they
say. S.A. Register triumphantly declares
that it had to fight him in order to help win
some such radical measures as women’s franchise.
But that is simply what Kingston’s friends claim
—that he has gone ahead while his opponents
have slid back. To know the position that
people and papers occupied 20 years ago is
of interest and value to-day chiefly because it
enables us to measure their movements since.
The further they have gone either way the
further they are likely to go ; and the more
political progress Kingston’s enemies can show
he has made, the bigger the hole they knock in
their own argument that he isn’t a progressive
Liberal. And, then, they say that he is an auto-
crat —the worst that was ever in Ministerial
office in S.A. Yet inside five minutes they are
busy pointing out that, though he personally
believes in the capitation grant for denomina-
tional schools, he has so little spirit (is, in fact,
so little of an autocrat) that he is going to re-
spect the referendum vote which decided against
that grant. They don’t say that their sort of a
Democrat—the “real Democrat,” that is—
would simply tell the majority to go fishing
while he fixed things up his own way ; but as
they yell at Kingston for not doing that,
clearly that is their conception of a “real
Democrat.” Fortunately, the majority is likely
to have its own idea about the matter.

In sending up only a dozen new members to the'

painfully anxious to be constitutional and

cases is that of Premier Ballance, who de-
manded 12 new appointments to Maoriland
Leg. Council, and got his way after a bitter
fight with Gov. Glasgow and an appeal to the
British Government. The reasons why th#

against the Governor were set forth by Lord
Ripon in his famous despatch. They were :
. 0 ) That the Ballance Government, having a majority
in the popular Chamber, but being in a great minority in
the Council, was entitled to ask for more representation.
(2) That the proposed addition would make the House
no larger than it had been at some previous times.
(3) That the proposed addition wouldn’t wholly destroy
the existing balance of parties.
Sydney Daily Telegraph has been quoting
this despatch against Reid ever since the pro-
posed new appointments were first mentioned.
And Reid has acted on it to the letter. His
12 new members don’t make the Council larger
than it has ever been before ; they only in-
crease the number of M’s.L.C. to 03, and the
number has, within the life of the present
Ministry, been as high as 74. Also, in ’92 it
was 76, so Reid can make seven more appoint-
ments and yet be strictly according to prece-
dent. And they don’t destroy the balance of
parties ; the anti-Billites showed a majority of
15, and this addition still leaves them in a
majority of three, so two more appointments
would still leave that precedent in perfect re-
pair. The provincial party and its organ have
been shrieking to Reid to be constitoosh’nal, as
the constitoosh’nal aspect of the case is laid
down in the famous Ripon despatch—and now
that he has done what they asked with a big
margin of Constitoosh’n to spare, they are a
little more angry than they were before.

Sandgroper Prison. Discipline.
The Westralian Penal Commission, which is
going into the individual cases of local prisoners,
is strengthening the demand for a Public
Defender and a Criminal Court of Appeal ;
also, it exposes once more that remarkable ad-
ministration of Sandgroper gaols under which,
for any of a multitude of breaches of discipline,
sentences are piled up until the Judge’s original
order is far exceeded. Thus a prisoner was
unearthed who has “done ” two years of a five
years’ sentence for stealing £5 worth of goods,
and who has still 4 years and 3 months to serve.
Another, a youth, sentenced for a trivial
offence, tried to get away. He was flogged,
and, when the Commission called round, “ap-
peared to be rapidly deteriorating, physi-
cally, morally, and mentally.” Another
prisoner complained that he ought to be
out of gaol ; he pointed, in proof, to the
scale of remissions exhibited for the en-
couragement of good conduct. Then, as
he seemed to have established his cp,se,
the authorities were appealed to; and
they showed that they calculated remissions on
a different scale altogether. Another prisoner
bad been found guilty of robbery from someone
whom the police could not produce and did nob
know. The case against him was extremely
rocky; but the accused, clumsily defending
himself—there wasn’t anybody else to do so—got
it out that there were previous convictions
against him. The jury accepted that as quite
good enough evidence, and convicted. The
Attorney-General afterwards seems to have
seen what sort of a case it was; but to a re-
quest made by the Commission for the man’s
release he replied that that “ would undermine
all discipline in the gaol ”! In still another
case, in backing up a refusal to recommend a
remission, the Attorney-General mis-stated
an offence for which a prisoner had been
previously sentenced; so that that “Court
of Appeal,” anyhow, is nob particularly
reliable. Nothing is, however, more strik-
ing in the Commissioner’s second report
than the scattered observations concern-
ing policemen and detectives dropping in to
tell prisoners that the officers know now they
are innocent. Eventually the Commission is
driven to remark upon this that “it is most
undesirable that officers of the police depart-
ment who have doubts as to the guilt of con-
victed prisoners should make any statements to'
the prisoners themselves.” They should “ com-
municate their information to their superior
officers.” But the Commission forgets that
discipline which must not be undermined !
Speaking generally, the apportionment of sen-
tences and the administration of prisons are
among the most unscientific things Australia
owns ; but in the West the traditions and pre-
judices of lagdom make them even more un-
scientific than usual.
More Camel.
Two more Afghans who broke their iniquitous
and oppressive agreement with their nigger-
driver, the Camel Carrying Co., of Bourke,
have been arrested on warrants granted by
some white magistrate or J.P. of N.S. Wales,
and are awaiting trial. The Bulletin’s
opinion of the awful beak who grants warrants
in such cases is suppressed as being unfit for
publication. But of one thing it is certain :
If any ordinary white broke his
agreement, and his vindictive boss wanted
a warrant for his arrest, in nine cases
out of ten any magistrate would refuse,
and tell that boss to proceed in the
ordinary way by summons. And the law
shouldn’t do things to help the brutal boss
nigger which it wouldn’t do to help the brutal
boss white—a nigger is no better than a white
man after all. Another thing is certain : When
the employes of the Camel Carrying Co. insist
so unanimously on breaking their agreement
and bolting from work and food and wages in
this bad time and this workless country, and
when no one wants to take their places, despite
the fact that the unemployed are around in
swarms, the Carrying Co.’s service must
be hell —or next door to it. No ordi-
nary boss nowadays cares whether his
hired man breaks his agreement or not—
he can get 300 more at any time. The boss
who has to put his employes in gaol to avoid
losing them just now—now when the person
who advertises for a man to do anything is in
danger of being smothered beneath the heap of
applicants —must be something unspeakable.
And the magistrates who grant warrants for the
recapture of the Carrying Co.’s lost nigger, and
the white man’s country of N.S. W. which
tolerates these magistrates, act as man-hunters
and nigger-drivers and assistant bullies to the
boss camel-man. They are the boss camel-
driver’s gratis bloodhound and mun-SAMBO.
Altogether it is a proud situation for any white
community to find itself in.
His Honor and a Lady.
Last week, in Melbourne, where the adminis-
tration of Justice is beginning to stink more
pungently than even the Yarra, for the first
time in a very long while a woman was
ordered solitary confinement. Judge Hodges
was holding the scales for the time being, and,
seeing that after his treatment of the Dungey-
Bromley case the balance showed a decided
lurch to starboard, he proceeded to make
things sultry for succeeding prisoners. The
woman’s offence was common or shop-door
larceny, and she had been six times previously
convicted —but not of larceny. The previous
offences were mostly “drunk ” or “ insulting
behavior” or “ langwidge,” and the whole lot
together only totalled three mouths. The
steal was a very small one, and was com-
mitted under the influence of drink. The
woman, who was undefended, drew his
Honor’s attention to these matters, and tearfully
pleaded for a lenient sentence. But no ! His
Honor was adamant! Justice must be vindi-
cated and the prisoner be made to squirm
especially after the Dungey-Bromgey farce.
So Mr. Hodges ordered 18 months’ hard labor,
together with six days’ solitary—two at a time.
Then the woman hysterically asked : “Can’t I
make an appeal to your Honor ? ” and Hodges
replied: “No, I’m afraid I’m often too soft;
but there are.times when I can’t be soft.”
Which remark was decidedly bad policy on the
part of Hodges. It drew attention to the fact
that His ’Onah had been remarkably soft in the
case of the other woman—the one who hired
herself out to the detective to persuade
a miserable individual to attempt abor-
tion on her; and who didn’t mind re-
presenting herself, for cash, as a female in
trouble—which generally means a female of
loose character ; and who was quite willing, for
cash, to hand over her body to be pawed (so far
as might be necessary to secure a conviction)
by complete strangers ; and who, having per-
suaded two wretched people to break the law,
rounded on her accomplices and got them
gaoled. His ’Onah was so soft with this woman
that he declared he wouldn’t punish her at all,
even if she was convicted. And his ’Onah’s
remark about the variations in his ’Onah’s
mode of administering justice—about the times
when he is soft and the times when he isn’t—
suggested to ignorant people that his ’Onah fell
like a big Alp on the friendless creature who
did her first little steal in an unsober moment
to make up for the way he grovelled to the
woman who had the Crown influence behind
£er.
Slavery in W.A.
The wrath of Big John Forrest and his crowd
at the badness of those bad men who talk
about nigger slavery in YVestralia is very
pathetic, but the slavery is there all right—
barring the name. The indenture system and
the judicious use of the vagrancy law amount
between them to a very comprehensive policy
of nigger bondage. The W.A. law regards
every nigger as a vagrant —not only the tame
nigger who loafs round towns but the wild
aboriginal in the bush. He is a vagrant because
he lives as his fathers did before him, and
doesn’t pay rent for a stone mansion, and go
daily to a place of business with a bell-topper
on. When the squatter wants aboriginals the
strong arm of the law goes out into the wilder-
ness and catches them, and proceeds to “ lum-
ber ” them as having no visible lawful means
of support. As a matter of fact they have all the
visible lawful means that they want—the wal-
laby and the grub and other wandering victuals
are their visible means—but the pastoral J.P.
refuses to take cognisance of any food that isn’t
bought in a shop. So he gives the nigger six
months, with the alternative that he may get
out of his vagrant state by being indentured for
a long term of years to the squatter. Any
able-bodied nigger that the pastoralist wants
has the alternative of going into bondage under
the indenture system, or of being gaoled over
and over again by the squatter J.P. till he
thinks better of it. But it isn’t slavery—not
actual slavery. The nigger need not be inden-
tured unless he pleases, and he needn’t go to
gaol either, if he obeys the law. Any nigger
who likes to come out of the bush, and open a
bank-account, and live in a good house, and
have an office or a shop and float syndicates,
can go about his business as freely as any
white J.P. It is his sinful obstinacy in not
doing these things which causes all the trouble.

“ Who Benefits by Old-Age Pensions ? ”
Christchurch (M.L.) Press, always strong in
the Conservative interest, wants to know
“who benefits by the Old-Age Pensions ” :
One of the pensioners who appeared on the platform
the other night to present the address to Mr. Sbddon
applied for an order directing his five sons to contribute
towards his maintenance. It appeared that they had
been for some years contributing among them Bs. 6d. per
week without an order, but now that he received a pen-
sion of 7s. per week they thought there ought to be a
“ rearrangement.” The Court ordered them to pay Is. a
week each, so as to make up the applicant’s income to
12s. a week, including the pension. The net result is,
therefore, that these five sons are relieved to the extent
of 3s. 6d. a week in the amount which they
contribute to their father’s support, and the general
taxpayer is called upon to give him 7s. a week.
Ought the aged father to be maintained by his five sons
whom he brought into the world, and doubtless kept dur-
ing the early part of their life, or ought the whole or part
of such duty to be cast upon strangers ? If the second
alternative is to be adopted, the result must in the end be
a loosening of filial bonds and a weakening of the family
as an institution. At the same time, it is easy to under-
stand why Mr. Seddon looks upon the Old Age Pensions
Act as such a good electioneering card. The sons who
found themselves relieved yesterday of a substantial por-
tion of their filial obligations by the State will naturally
vote for the Ministry which shifted the burden from their
own shoulders on to those of strangers.
A great (leal depends on how you put the
thing. There are about 160,000 males of the
taxpaying age outside lunatic asylums, hos-
pitals and gaols in Maoriland, and the Old Age
Pensions will probably cost them something
over £1 a year each. Now, the old man above-
mentioned was a very ancient old man, and to
estimate his life at eight years more is pretty
liberal. And (as a son is generally some
years younger than his father) the five sons
will probably, on an average, judging by their
present ages, remain taxpayers for another 20
years —if they are as tough as the old man they
may keep on paying taxes for even longer than
that. So if there had been no Old Age Pen-
sions their little bill for the maintenance of the
old man would probably have been :
Eight years at £22 2s. per annum ... £l7O 10 o
And under the Old Age Pension system their
bill seems likely to be
Eight years direct payments to the old man
at £l3 per annum £lO4
Twenty years’ contributions to cost of Old
Age Pensions at £5 per annum 100
£204
Apparently these five sons, whose case is such
a horrible example of how to shift the burden
of the aged progenitor on to strangers, have
fallen in. And, meanwhile, the aged progeni-
tor, who used to get £22 2s. a year, now finds
himself revelling in the unaccustomed luxury
of £3l 4s.—so he is doubtless quite satisfied.
What’s the Tory row about, and where does
the “shifting of the burden on to strangers ”
come in ?

A Federal City.
“ Aletes ” to The Bulletin :
Have visited one of the Federal cities, and was nobbled
at my first glimpse of her. Had traversed hundreds of
miles of burnt-up country any shade but green, when
before me appeared an oasis,'a gleaming emerald in a
setting of sapphires. Early morning, on a hill that glit-
tered with the sheen of silver leaves, and looking east-
wards. A new-born sun swathed in clouds. A valley of
blue mist, soft and delicate, a sea of thistle-down. Out
of it rising in harmony together the aspiring efforts of
nature and of man. All around, far off, dark blue hills,
streaked with shadows, undulating gracefully against a
pearl-grey sky. Southward, a grey riband unrolling
and twisting in and out of flat, verdant meadows.
In the air the exhilaration of wine. Went down into
the mist and it faded. Found long wide avenues of
charming, robust trees, clad in autumnal vestures, grey-
green and olive. Beyond and between, peering and
glowing, warm red homes with sweet-smelling gardens.
Wandered south through fields yellow-starred with
dandelion. Found the grey riband a stream of rushing
waters that eddied and gurgled over snags and shallows.
And the shore whereon I stood was alien to the shore
whereon I looked. Two sullen provinces glared across
that laughing face. It was the time-honored barrier that
had kept, would keep, them twain. But the river, know-
ing not, caring not, caressed both shores and mingled
their kisses on its pebbly sandy floor. When lips are
kissing, will hearts be long sundered ? And the stream
knew that beneath it, such a little way down, lay a bond
that all the mighty force of all the mighty nations of the
world could never break. Here surely Nature whispers
of—points to—the cradle of a New Nation. Hgre in this
rich, juicy land of the Grape—
“ The Grape that can with Logic absolute
The two-and-seventy jarring sects confute
The Sovereign Alchemist ”•
Is not this an ideal rendezvous for our future statesmen ?
Destiny hovers above us, shackled, bound to earth. Let
us break the shackles, sever the cord. Then, after
Her !—be it to Paradise or to Perdition !
Hooray !
All last week or more Sydney Telegraph
was fishing with the decomposed worm of
prejudice for old precedents bearing on the
proposed “ swamping” of N.S. W. Leg. Council.
The old precedents didn’t bite freely, still it
got a few. What it struggled to prove, in long
wildernesses of print dealing with the con-
stitoosh’n, was that, if the people were in favor
of some particular course, and the popularly-
elected Assembly was also in favor, and the
Council blocked the way, the only thing to do
was to dissolve the Assembly and get the people
to say all over again that they approved. And
if they did so, and the Council condescended to
be quite satisfied that they had done so, then
the Council would give way—at least the
Telegraph said it would. And if the Council
didn’t give way then there was nothing to be
done. In any case swamping the House of
Nominees was so sinful and illegal as
to be quite out of the calculation. But
Premier Reid waddled quite unconcernedly
through all these cobwebs of precedent, and
paid no more attention than if the D.T. had
been a grasshopper lecturing out in the pad-
dock. The precedent he went on was that a
Government with an Assembly majority behind
it has always had the right to recommend as
Ms.L.C. any moderate number of sober, clean
male persons who haven’t been in gaol, and
don’t whack their wives too publicly, and to
do it without giving any definite reason for its
action. And that seems to be all the precedent
that the case called for.
Beautiful lie which appears persistently in
the advertising columns of a N.S. W. sugar-
district. paper:—
rpo THE RESIDENTS ON THE CLARENCE
-*- AND RICHMOND RIVERS.
Do you know that directly Federation takes place
a bounty of Five Pounds (£5) per ton will be given to
the Victorian growers of beet sugar ?
Sydney, March 24.
The Bulletin respectfully asks the Dibbs and
Heydon and GEORGE-PiLE’s-dog crowd, in
Sydney, if it will repudiate the enthusiastic
member of its party who invented that lie, and
state that, though it is anti-Federal itself, it
wants to win by fair means, and not by such
three-card tricks as the above ? Or will it just
be thankful for whatever votes the above
Ananias puts in its way and say nothing ?
Brisbane Telegraph, among other things,
denounces the Federal Bill as—
A measure which strips all the States of the greater
portion of their natural rights, powers, and possessions,
&c.
And yet it only amounts to this : The six
States (separately) give up to the same six
States (jointly) certain “natural rights, powers,
and possessions.” The anti-Bill crowd’s doc-
trine is : We want union without uniting any-
thing. We want to retain our separate powers
and privileges and to unite at the same time.
We don’t want to unite our customs, excise,
railways, debts, posts, telegraphs, or anything
at all—we merely want to unite in theory.
What we desire is a' disunited Federation in six
separate combined pieces, and we are prepared
to whoop for the distracted Federal fragmen-
tary busted league of Australia for all we are
worth, and to perish fighting for the dissevered
confederation of our great country.
Westralia possesses an annoying person
named A. P. Matheson, who was lately
appointed a member of the Federal Council,
and who, unlike most of those representing the
province on the Council or at the Convention,
considered it necessary that he should know
something of Federation. So when the two
Perth dailies started with a wild screech to
describe the rum Federation would bring on
W.A., Matheson got out his copv of the
Federation BiH ancf compared
With it. He found the West Australian
declaring that the smaller provinces would in-
evitabiy be overruled in changes of constitution,
because if a proposed change were twice
rejected (m a Federal House) it might be at
once sent to a referendum, and, if passed,
become law. Therefore, argued the West
Australian, the big States would have all
their own way in the matter. But Matiie-
son upset this beautiful argument by showing
that clause 127 of the Federation Bill required
a so that the proposed change of constitution
siiould be approved by the electors of a majority
of States. Next the Morning Herald entered
npon its groan and pictured Westralia losing
Customs revenue, because much foreign goods
would be shipped to the larger provinces and
thence distributed to Westralia in coasting
vessels, the importing provinces sticking to the
Customs revenue. Matheson arose once more
and pointed out that by section 93 of the
Commonwealth Bill it was expressly provided
that all duties of Customs and Excise charged
on goods imported into one State and after-
vvards passing into another State for consump-
tion would be credited to the consuming State.
And now these Federation writers who know
nothing of Federation call Matheson an un-
patriotic hireling of the Eastern States, because
be showed them up.
Johnny Haynes and E. M. Clark, M’s.L.A.,
shook the seedy suburb of Leichhardt with
their anti-Federal yell last Saturday. The old,
smiling, clap-trappy John told the people
(Daily Telegraph report) that—
The forcing of a measure through by mere numbers was
utterly opposed to every principle of iiberty dear to Eng-
lish-speaking communities.
So, evidently, the majority shouldn’t rule, for
the only thing a majority can do is to force its
measure through by force of numbers, and as
that is “ opposed to every principle of liberty,”
the proper caper is to let the minority run the
show. And the bawling E. M. Clark got off
the other stereotyped wheeze :
N.S.W. was in the unfortunate condition of the prodi-
gal’s father. The other colonies had broken away from
her and had wasted their substance in riotous living, and
now they wanted to come to her for succor.
It will probably be quite a surprising piece of
news to S.A. and Westralia to hear that
N.S.W. ever was their father, or that they
ever “broke away” from “her” (the father
aforesaid). And the other provinces, after re-
ceiving, in nine years, four urgent appeals
from N.S.W. to come and federate with her,
will probably be a little astonished at the con-
stant lie of the N.S.W. anti-Federal push that
it is they who have been coming to N.S.W. for
succor. But all sorts of strange things happen
in the strange menagerie of anti-Bill. Even
the spectacle of a father being “ her ” is quite
natural there.

A sample of N.S. W. Jaypeeism, from Armidale
Argus, l/4/’99
Thomas Harris, on remand [! ! ! —Ed. B.] was charged
with being indebted to Walton M‘N kill, of Boggabri, in
the sum of £1 2s. for work done, and absconding from
that place whilst so indebted. Mr. S. J. Kearney ap-
peared for accused.
Constable Cornish gave evidence as to arrest, and also
produced a warrant, signed by a magistrate at Boggabri
for the arrest of accused.
Mr. Kearney asked the Bench to dismiss the case against
his client, as the warrant did not contain any specific
charge, and the offence was not to be found on the statute
book.
The P.M., in discharging the accused, said that his
arrest was perfectly illegal, and that the warrant should
never have been issued. The police at Armidale were
quite justified in the action they had taken, but he
thought that the magistrate who signed the warrant had
rendered himself liable to an action for damages. He
considered that the matter ought to be brought under the
notice of the Government.
Just imagine it ! Arrested and remanded on a
charge of owing 225. !

Thus the Australasian on the Q. elections :
Nearly all the mining towns—Gympie, Charters Towers,
Clermont, Croydon—have been captured by Labor. . . .
But the extraordinary thing is that nearly all the great
pastoral electorates in the Central-West and the North-
West remain the spoil of the Labor politicians. The em-
ploying class, which finds the capital and takes the ter-
rible risks of a capricious climate, is prostrate before the
class it supports ! !! ”
This is truly fine. The poor devils who shear
in a shed where the mercury runs up to 120° in
the shade don’t take any risks at all. The
hapless swagman who dies of thirst beside a
dried-up tank in a droughty summer isn’t
exposed to the fury of a “ capricious climate ”
in the least—we suppose. And, as to supporting
any class, how can a poor wretch who has no
capital beyond a pair of brawny arms and a
weary swag do anything at all in the line of
“ supporting ” ? Why—he’s only here on the
earth upon sufferance.
Re the frequent solitary confinement of young
“Willie” Phillips, prisoner at; Pentridge
(Melb.), a former mate of the unhappy
crank informs The Bulletin that Phillips
—“loathsome little beast” was driven
to insubordination by the system. In the
first instance, the murderer of bookkeeper
Brady, whose lying “ confession ” had saved
him from the gallows, was a pampered criminal,
as Pentridge pampering goes. He robbed the
prison store, was sent to solitary confinement,
and thence to separate solitary confinement—
whatever the difference may mean. Now he is
a persistent rebel, banging away at the door of
his lonesome hell, and rapidly qualifying him-
self for a certificate of lunacy. The Bulletin,
whilst opposed to hanging as a judicial punish-
ment, admits that an early death would have
been a good thing for the individual Phillips.
But, seeing that his sentence was commuted,
Phillips should be treated by the law as one
whose life is worth preserving. At present, he
suffers persecution, not on account of the
murder and thefts he committed in and out of
gaol, but because he has lost his last vestige of
self-restraint. It were hard to say what ought
to be done with Phillips, but it is certain that
the thing which ought nob to be done happens
every week in this case.
It is officially estimated that the population
of Westralia decreased by 771 during March,
making a decrease of 1657 for the first three
months of ’99.

To-day (Thursday afternoon) Mr. R.
D’Orsay Ogden is to have a benefit at Sydney
Criterion. Among the patrons are Premier Reid,
the Mayor of Sydney, the Major-General, and
other full-rigged notables of great tonnage and
carrying capacity, and a very fine pro-
gramme has been arranged with many good
people in it. Apropos of the above, a cor-
respondent sends in a summary of Mr. Ogden’s
troubled career. Mr. Ogden is now 64, and it
is 43 years since he was persuaded to leave
the stage (he had just made a beginning in
the Southern States) and go with Walker, about
the last of the filibusters, to invade Nicaragua and
Honduras. Walker ran an exciting dictatorship
for a year or two and was then captured and exe-
cuted, and young Ogden and 84 others were
going the same road when some influential Ameri-
can friends obtained a reprieve for the former.
The 84, having no influential friends handy, “went
up.” Ogden left the stage again to be a captain
in the Confederate service at the beginning of the
Civil War, and he saw it through ; the battered
remnant of him was among the crowd which sur-
rendered with Lee in ’65 at Appomatox Court
House. Connoisseurs who have seen the old
veteran without his clothes say that he isn’t
pleasant to look upon “in the nood,” being
grievously scarred and hacked and chipped by
shot and other hostile expressions. Anyhow, The
Bulletin trusts that his benefit will be a soure e
of great wealth, and that his latter days will be
more peaceful than those in which he carried a
gun in Nicaragua.

The unpaid wash-bill of Bonaparte still
waves rather unsatisfactorily on the outer wall at
Sydney Royal. There is nothing large the matter
with the new Brough venture, but various
small things, are against it, and, so far as The
Bulletin can size up the situation, Sydney only
feels moderately good over the new venture. It
expected great things of the co. to begin with, for
it remembered the almost perfection of the two
B.’s combination in its best days; and the only
comparative regularity of the goose-step kept by
the new crowd is a disappointment. It is a
respectable, ordinary co., so far as can be seen, but
miles behind the old 8.-B. tradition. That
tradition, pursues Brough like the wet grey dog
that will insist on coming home with one at the
hazy hour of 13 p.m. Then “ Sans-Gene ” depends
practically upon two characters, and Brough is so
far away from all the accepted theories of
the Man of Destiny that 'one of the two
fails to strike the public in the right place.
Possibly he is nearer to the real individual than
the idealised portrait of the man with the pallid
face and the dark forelock. Napoleon I. was un-
fortunately out when The Bulletin called at his
palace, so'it has to take his countenance on trust.
But, anyhow, it is too late to start making a new
Bonaparte now, and that is practically what is
being attempted at the Royal. “ Sans-Gene,” at
the best, is never likely to catch on with the
gallery or the back row of the pit. It has no par-
ticular story to tell, and no particular ending.
The fact that the rather inaudible Austrian gentle-
man escapes from serious trouble in the last act
would strike the public harder if the said Austrian
had previously got a hold on its sympathies, but
he hasn’t. If Napoleon would even pay his long-
forgotten wash-bill it would be something definite,
but just when he is about to pay it he finds he has
no money in his apparel, and the chance is lost.

The unaccountable brown lady at Sydney
Lyceum, who makes so many excited remarks
about the British Flag, hasn’t retired from her
illogical attitude on that subject, and all demands
for an explanation remain unanswered. The
Eublic has taken rather kindly to her on the whole.
he wears gaudy red and yellow clothes which are
so built that one plump, coffee-tinted shoulder and
one bangled arm are bare —-the arm with which
she waves the knife that never injures anybody;
she always waves it when she is having her worst
fit about the British Flag. And once, when
something very awful has just been done on the
stage, a back curtain goes up silently and impres-
sively, like the price of eggs rising in the night,
and reveals her as a brown statue pointing her
knife at the Milky Way. There is a palm-tree or
a cactus or a baobab, or something, in the back-
ground, and a streak of starry sky and a patch of
sea, and the vision leaves an idea that the native
lady sleeps that way instead of going to bed.
Nothing new has been done in the way of scenic
effects since last week, for if any more scenery
was put in the Lyceum would burst.

The last nights of the “ Geisha ” are an-
nounced at Her Majesty’s, so whoever has not seen
the artless Jappy frivol is hereby warned to roll
up. The principal reason why everybody should
roll up is that the larger the multitude the more
chance there is that somebody in it may be able to
really explain what all the rolling-up is about.
For The Bulletin doesn’t know and never ex-
Sects to. “ lolanthe ” is in preparation at Her
lajesty’s. Considering what a furore the
“Geisha” made, beautiful “lolanthe” should
cause such a rush that there will be fatal acci-
dents on the stairs, but the corpses will be
carried up in the storm of flesh and tall hats and
swallow-tails and won’t have room to drop.

“ Othello ” keeps up its record of unquali-
fied success at Sydney Criterion, but Rignold
wisely recognises that the life of even the best
Shakespearian show is limited, and the “Merry
Wives of Windsor ” is in preparation. The date
of the new production is yet unfixed, but the
management is getting ready to take off its
strangled Desdemona as soon as circumstances
call for her removal.

Three lady gymnasts bearing the strange
out-of-date name of Keziah —three Keziahs—are
to join Rickards’ Tivoli co. on Saturday, and
Manuel Woodson, contortionist, is due at the
same date. So are Edith Conley and George
Carew. The latter pair will try to fill the vacant
places of Albert Bellman and bright Lottie Moore,
who are going this week.

Fitzgeralds’ Circus is in splendid health
at Redfern (Sydney), and is crowded to the door
every night. It has done even better this time
than on its last appearance ; probably the extra
people come in hopes that the lion and the ele-
phant will have an unpleasantness and fight it
out on the tricycle, or that the tiger will take
an objection to the horse. Among the large
collection of beasts which smell more or less
in the back part of the show the ourang-
outang seems to draw most money. He is
supposed to be a direct ancestor of man, as
man was before he scraped the hair off himself and
started to build gaols to put himself in ; and he
looks like an animal with a Past. Both the
menagerie and circus grow larger every time the
Fitzes come this way, and if it grows much larger
the average tired man will have to hire someone
to help him to look at it.

“Round the World in Eighty Days” is
doing its last week at Sydney Opera House, but
its successor is not announced up to time of
writing.
* * *
The Bulletin has been requested (by a
lady) to unreservedly withdraw some allusions in
its issue of 25th March, as follows :
In the absence of any further law reports about the
fury of the American gentleman who used to offer cock-
tails to the press of Sydney, it is generally understood
that the troubles of Dante and his late partner have been
settled. At all events, Dante and manager Lohr are left
in peaceful possession at the Palace, and the former
draws his spectral refreshment out of the empty drain-
pipe with the air of a man who has no troubles on his
mind, and his programme of strange appearances and
disappearances, and his bottle of innumerable drinks, and
his other mysteries, hustle along in a pleasant, light-
hearted fashion. Dante’s real name—as sworn to when
the embittered American gentleman wanted damages, or
the earth, or something—is Oscar Eliason, which would
look a good deal better on the bills, in The Bulletin’s
opinion, than his professional cognomen—&c.
* * * *
The paper feels in a pacific mood this week,
and so friendly that it would feed out of the hand,
so it doesn’t mind withdrawing. Every hospitable
American gentleman who comes this way offers
the press a cocktail when they happen to meet,
but if the friends of the one above-mentioned de-
sire to have him represented as a dry and inhos-
pitable American gentleman—well, the cocktail is
off. And if he happens this way again and doesn’t
approve of the action of his friends in this matter,
the cocktail can be turned on again. It was a
very good cocktail, too, that one which didn’t
happen; and the writer would have enjoyed
it very much when he and the Ameri-
can gentleman foregathered at the Marble Bar
if either of them .had been there, only they
weren’t. This paper doesn’t mind going further,
if it will make things any pleasanter, and saying
that there is no such person as either of them, and
the idea of a myth offering a drink to a baseless
rumor is quite absurd. Anyhow, the gentleman
wasn’t furious, nor embittered, nor any other
adjective whatever, nor any pronoun, verb or in-
terjection either, and he didn’t want the earth nor
anything else. The Bulletin is quite prepared
to say that he was so absolutely contented that he
didn’t want anything at all—not even his own
clothes. The present writer has always wanted
the earth himself, and doesn’t fully understand
this contented state of mind, but if the above
statement, or any other statement, will help to
make things any smoother, or help a fellow-mortal
on his path, it is all right. If there is anything
more that the friends of the gentleman so unfor-
tunately alluded to would like to have withdrawn
they have only to mention it. The withdrawal it-
self, if it doesn’t suit, can be withdrawn at the
shortest notice. Present writer, in earlier and
more stormy days, made a living for a while by
withdrawing timber off a range of mountains
with a horse-team, and he once withdrew from a
mine just before it caved in, After that sort of
experience he reckons he knows enough about the
business to withdraw anything.

Melbourne is not very angry with “The
Belle of New York ” now that the first-night
disappointment has spent its fury. The
“B. of N.Y.” is to ordinary musical comedy
what “Evangeline” of yore was to contemporary
opera-bouffe. In defence of the present importa-
tion, the Firm may plead that, whereas “Evan-
geline” —an inane “opera” with a fat Fortescue
and a speechless Lone Fisherman in it— always
ranked as insufferable rubbish outside its
native country, the comedy which contains a
Mixed Ale Pugilist, a Polite Lunatic, and a
Eiir of Automatic Twins is a success in
ondon and other un-American places. But it
appears, from information received, that “The
Belle ” has prospered abroad mainly through the
saving grace of the lady in the name part. Nobody
thinks the comedy humorous, but everybody
admires the picture of the dainty Salvation Army
girl, who makes the whole Bowery fragrant and
flowery and leads all the young men from destruc-
tion for just as long as they can keep her figure in
view. There’s a happy dramatic thought in the
lament of the eternal Feminine, as she droops her
tambourine and gazes straight down her dear little
nose—“ They don’t proceed to follow the Light:
they only follow me.”
* * ■* *
If Miss Louise Hepner, in the name-part,
and tall, thin Oscar Girard, in the character of
her adopted guardian, were not bright, refined
artists, “ The Belle of New York ” wouldn’t de-
serve any more consideration than “The Ameri-
can Girl ” got at the Princess’s last year. On the
other hand, if Miss Hepner had a finer voice and
a little more magnetism, and if she looked as con-
vincing to the people in the way-back stalls as she
appears to the front rows of audience, the Firm’s
latest production might have been less roughly criti-
cised by folks in general. But it occurs to Bulle-
tin that although Miss Hepner would carry 40
per cent, more charm in a smaller theatre, the
performances of the second-raters (the very
second-raters) would be less trying if the house
were much bigger ; and, anyway, the Princess’s is
just the right size for the Firm’s chorusers and
chorusesses, who are many and frequent in the
“B. ofN.Y.” Some bottled-up feeling concern-
ing the awfullest features of this show will pro-
bably explode next week, or later. Meanwhile
the appallingly stout gent in the tight-fitting
fancy vest is under observation; but the young
hero, the automatic Twins, and the mock trage-
dian named Mugg have been denied the benefit
of the doubt, because they are beyond any reason-
able doubt whatsoever.

The opinion of Easter multitudes at the
Royal—they swarmed there every night last week
—was palpably favorable to Bland Holt’s gorgeous
undertaking, so it may be that “ Woman and
Wine ” is booked for a long run. Success comes
easily to a melodrama which reveals a steeple-
chase, a ballet, and a knife-contest between two
improper ladies, especially when the duel is
backed up by artist Brunton’s best work. The
Paris Flower Market, growing brighter in the
rising sunlight, is a great scene for a mortal
combat, and the destruction of Miss Wat-
son by Miss Gill now" shows a great improve-
ment on the first-night effect. If the struggling
furies will kindly add a couple of . inciden-
tal shrieks, and allow Caliban to re-sharpen
their knives on his grindstone at half-time,
“Woman and Wine” will be as crimson a
spectacle as one could wish. The grindstone is a
delightfully gruesome idea as far as it goes, but it
ought to be carried further. “Caliban” Styan,
Miss Gill, Walter Baker, and Miss Watson are
expending a lot of evil passion upon this well-
painted drama, also the comic relief seems to
appeal to that part of the audience which
doesn’t always remove its hat. Mrs. Bland
Holt, whose yellow hair and new, frilly man-
ners suit her nicely, is the lawful mother of
Bland’s live baby, and the baby is discovered by
father Brown before he has learned of his boy’s
matrimony. When Brown charges boy Bland
with the authorship of the mysterious infant, and
demands the name of the mother that he may
force her to “make an honest man ” of Bland by
marrying him, the dear creatures in the stalls and
circles enjoy a roar of innocent merriment all
round. Then they remark to one another that the
joke is “ rather suggestive,” and they endeavour
to feel like angels suffering from a sudden attack
of double entendre.

Some years ago Melbourne went suddenly
crazy over the matter of John Kruse, a Victorian-
born violinist of the most respectable character.
R. S. Smythe was the power behind the Kruse
boom, and most of the profits went into his mUch-
travelled pocket—which was a fair thing under
the circumstances. Since the Kruse craze there
has never been a Melb. Town Hall rush to com-
pare with the rush to hear Miss Amy Castles,
“the wonderful soprano,” on Saturday night.
Miss Castles, from Bendigo, represents the
first attempt of the Austral Salon to create
a Future Melba and shine in her reflected
glory, and the result thus far is a great
success for the hens and chickens of that
clucksome institution. The Salon influence is
responsible for Cast.es in the air, where the dam-
sel will remain awhile. The public believed her
wonderful before they heard her sing ; her voice
was sufficiently strong and sweet to keep the pub-
lic faith alive. That’s how the matter stands. To
the wild, hysterical eye of the easy believer, Miss
Castles presents herself as a young and growing
girl whose voice will rise and swell to the pitch of
perfection under scientific tuition. Many musi-
cal authorities profess to take the same view of
the case. Musical experts are always seek-
ing outlets for their enthusiasm, and they are
all open to receive a new pupil. The present
writer is a mere Goth, haunted by recollections of
previous future Melbas and Crossleys, whose
“wonderful” promises haven’t been fulfilled,
therefore this scribe will swear to nothing re Miss
Amy Castles, except that her prodigious self-con-
fidence doesn’t indicate what Svengali called “ the
artist nature.” Miss Regina Nagel’s nervousness
was much more promising. The Goth is told
Miss Castles will be 18 next birthday, and he
presumes that her mother hasn’t lost count of one
or two years, but he reckons that the young lady’s
childishness begins in her loose hair and terminates
round the hem of her short frock. At the
ago of 18 she is seemingly a little woman
of unrobust appearance. She sings with a
big, round voice, which is quite likely to
lose some of its music in course of educa-
tion, but is not very likely to develope more
feeling. If a full, round voice doesn’t thrill one,
the power to thrill is, presumably, lacking. This
unbelieving scribe has heard Miss Castles sing
“ Qui la voce ” in a room and at the Town Hall,
and no chord came from the soul of her vocal
organ to enter into his. Therefore, he assumes
that either he or the damsel in the juvenile frock
hasn’t a soul, and he considers himself an ignorant
brute, anyhow.
At Melb. Alexandra the unspeakable
humor of “Jack Sheppard ” was seriously digested
by a vast audience on Saturday, and the plump
she-hero known as Jack aforesaid will commit
various outrages for one week only. Also, Jona-
than Wild, assisted by Blueskin, will die of an
alleged gunpowder explosion, leaving the small
boys in the gallery to whistle his requiem. As a
lesson in managerial policy, and a revelation of
weird wigs and other clothing, “Jack Sheppard”
is a thing to see and remember evermore. Duncan
Macallum’s advt. exhorts the masses to look out
for “Waiting for the Verdict,” which will
probably happen next Saturday. The Bulletin
is looking out.

Dante, the conjuror who captured the
vote and interest of this journal when he first
appeared in Sydney—Dante the Great, likewise
the Only—is to introduce hifnself to Melbourne on
Saturday next (15th) at St. George’s Hall. The
long, lank building next to the Theatre Royal has
been an unfrequented place for a good many years,
but Dante will just come along and produce large
and fashionable attendances from his hat every
evening until further notice. At the Bijou all is
well with the Rickards Co., and in Melbourne’s
highah musical circles the fame of Herr Frieden-
thal looms large just now. The German pianist,
who plays a lone hand, i. e. , two lone hands, and
is said to keep his audiences excited all the time,
will appear at the Town Hall on Saturday and
some days next week.
*# * *
Allan and Co., the Melb. music publishers,
have removed from their fortunate “ pitch,” at the
corner of the Block Arcade, into bigger premises
(a few doors higher up in Collins-street) erected on
the site of the warehouse where the late George
Allan, sen., started business 22 years ago. For
the new warehouse, which formally opened last
week, the present George Allan claims that it is
the best-equipped institution of the kind in Aus-
tralia, and all the long-haired professors who have
sampled it sing praises to its name. In fact, Mel-
bourne’s musical taste will need to advance and
expand considerably in order to get on level terms
with the place where the local plutocracy gathered
for harmonious drinking purposes last Thursday.
Allan and Co. have done much towards creating
customers for the music-trade, and they hope to
do better as time goes on. Meanwhile the manager
makes a reasonable appeal for a municipal brass
band, chosen from the local military tunists, to
play in the city’s public reserves and prepare the
souls of the masses for the gospel of Marshall Hall.

“ The French headquarters staff were cog-

“ The Honor of the Army ! ”
In Chambers this week Chief-Justice Dar-
ley gave a rule nisi in the case of an Afghan em-
ployed by the slave-driving Camel Co., of Bourke;
restraining the local magistrate from further
iniquitous imprisonment.
Judging from the wired accounts of his re-
ception at Adelaide, Gov. Tennyson takes himself
very seriously indeed. Also, he is rather inclined
to lay on jam with a trowel and spread his little
net in sight of the birds.
One circumstance in connection with the
recent Victorian military corroboree that wasn’t
reported by the great dailies, was the hopeless
breaking-down all over the shop of the ammuni-
tion waggons constructed in a hurry for use at the
encampment. One contingent went to .pieces
within a mile or two of Melbourne, and a lot more
were scattered about in ruins before the great
martial scramble was ended, and in several cases
crazy furniture vans had to be utilised to carry
round the requisites, thus imparting a painful low-
comedy flavor to the warlike and bloodthirsty
proceedings.
The Victorian minimum wage law has
raised the wages in the furniture trade from 30s.
to about 50s. Owing to the fact that nearly every
Chinese tradesman in Melbourne is in the furni-
ture biz, this was the most utterly depressed in-
dustry in the city, and the minimum wage gave
it a great lift. But the Chow cabinetrmaker
breaks the law so persistently that there will either
have to be a separate inspector for each Chow, or
the alternative will some day lie between letting
go the minimum wage or rushing the leper wood-
carver into the mail-boat for home. And the
sooner the latter is done the better.

The Chief Engineer of Vic. Railways, discussing
apian drawn nine years ago for a big central station in
Melbourne, gave some figures which go far towards excus-
ing the errors of Speight’s sanguine management. It
seems that between 1883, the year of Speight’s arrival,
and 1890, when the land-boom was at its boomiest, the
annual number of passengers booked on Melb. suburban
lines rose froha 25,000,000 to 59,000,000. Speight’s calcula-
tions were based on an almost incredibly false state of
things. A yearly increase of traffic was taken for granted
at that time, whereas the suburban railway returns last
year, in spite of “ returning prosperity,” showed a reduc-
tion of about 16,000,000 passengers on the figures for 1890.

N.S.W. Chamber of Mines urges that tnere

the same direction. No reasonable objection can be
found to the proposal ; but it isn’t going to stop either
gold-pilfering or the selling of pilfered.gold. In'Vic., at
any rate, nearly all the “ crook” gold gets into the banks ;
and it has been suggested, too, that branch officers, sus-
pecting that all hasn’t been quite right, have ventured to
offer below a fair price, and have then flattered them-
selves that they have done good biz. for their bosses.
While Parliament is about it, it ought to license gem-
buyers, too ; that is wanted in some districts very badly,
if only to silence nasty rumors.

Prospects seem better for tin than for copper.
Of the former metal, by far the biggest producers are the
Straits Settlements, worked mostly by Chinese. Now,
without digging up once more the sadly-battered “ cur-
rency problem,” it is certain that these Eastern mine-
bosses have benefited hugely by the fall in silver ; they
sell for geld and pay in the white stuff. Their advantage
has been so great that for three years past they have
strained production to what is believed to be the very
limit, and indeed past the limit that can be sustiined.
The recent big rise, therefore, is not at all likely to be
followed by that spurt in output which most big rises ring
in.

“The value of Klondyke gold varies much, ac-
cording to locality where found,” writes a Bulletin cor-
respondent. “ The maximum price has been £3 7s. 6d. to
£3 10s. per oz. The ‘ Bench ’ claims turned out very
good last season—notably French Hill (on the Eldorado)
and Big Skookum (now Gold Hill, at the fork of the
Bonanza and Eldorado), though, as in creek .claims, the
patchy nature of the deposits in bench claims proves
many a hard-sunk shaft a duffer. One man’s claim on
the second tier on Big Skookum turned out rich, whereas
the next but one, though located precisely over the old
river bed, has not even a color on bedrock. Another
claim on No. 3 tier had two cradles going for nine or ten
weeks, daily average 200 oz. coarse gold, and yet the next
claim was utterly valueless. No payable quartz-leaders
have been found as yet; reports to the contrary are wild
cats, and it needs reef-mining to give the place stability ;
but the country is so vast that prohably such finds will be
made yet.”

The revenue of the five provinces which issue
monthly statements of Treasury receipts was as follows
for March, 1899
Revenue for Increase as compared
March. with March, ’9B.
Queensland ..£'416,413 £115,863

Tasmania .. .. 76,579 2,709

New South Wales .. 906,382 49,987
So far as the present financial year has gone (to
31st March, 1899), the improvement or otherwise in the
revenue of the six provinces is as follows :
Increase as
compared with
Revenue, correspond in g
period of 1898.

Victoria ( „ ) 5,425,321 .. 304,190

Decrease as
compared with
correspond i n g
period of 1898.
Westralia (9 months) 1,800,042 .. 248,000
At time of writing the expenditure accounts
from two provinces were to hand. They compared with
revenue as follows:
Queensland (Surplus) .. £570,168
New South Wales (Deficit) .. 565,204
Owing to the different dates at which interest on the
public debt falls due, Queensland usually has a surplus
and N.S.W. a deficit about this time. The only interest-
ing point is that both are a good deal larger than usual.
The New South Wales deficit at 31st March,
1893, was £316/171, so things are £248,933 worse than they
were at the corresponding period of 1897 and this,
despite the fact that N.S.W. is the only province of the
group which materially increased its taxation this year.
The increase of £474,049 in the expenditure and the fact
that the income-tax returns are late this year are the
visible causes of the trouble. For the nine months to
31st March, 1899, the expenditure out of loans has been
£1,496,054 —£225,140 more than the loan expenditure for
the nine months to 31st March, 1898. Every year the
pile of small unproductive everyday works and jobs and
repairs which ought to be charged to revenue, and which
are charged to loans to make the deficit look smaller,
grows more formidable. Ttie Bulletin begins to foresee
a joyous time (if Reid remains long enough in office) when
everything will be charged to loans, and therefore all the
ordinary revenue will be surplus.

The falling-off in Tasmania’s revenue for March
possibly means nothing, but this is only the second occa-
sion in two years or more when the island’s monthly
revenue return has shown a decline, and the small isle
has grown unused to that kind of shock.
Apropos of a number of things, it is interesting
to consider how the revenues of the Seven Provinces im-
proved or otherwise during the last two financial years.
The figures are taken bodily from Ooghlan’s “ Statistics
of the Seven Colonies,” and the two-year limit is fixed
because, by going further back, the figures for N.S.W.
would be affected by the abolition of the Dibbs duties :

When the Federal Enabling Bill was before the N.S.W.
Council the proviricialist fossils rose one by one to lament
that N.S.W. was the only financially progressive province
in the group and shouldn’t dream of federating with the
other wrecks) whose poverty was so awful that they
would have to live on N.S.W. As old Macintosh wailed,
the other States “are now in such a position that they
can hardly raise any money or pay interest on their debts ;
most of them are in a decline.” To the ignorant old
political louts of the Council it is so much an article of
faith that N.S.W. must always be the only prosperous
place in the crowd that they never worry about the facts
or the. figures. The Macintosh kind of man is beautiful
material to make a life-legislator out of.

The complete report by mail explains that Vic-
toria’s conversion loan of £1,600,000 realised £94 17s. 6d.,
and as stamp-duty to the British Govt., &c., presumably
have to be deducted, the net result to Vic. will be about
£94. And this is described as a success. Now, let it be
supposed that, instead of borrowing from Bull, Vic. Govt,
had had pluck enough to use itsown credit, by issuing notes
which would be legal tender within the province for all pur-
poses, including the payment of State taxes, and adopted
the Canadian principle of requiring the banks to keep
40 per cent, of their local reserves in State notes. That
would have enabled it to lay its hands on the required
£1,600,000 and a good deal over without interest. If it
was prepared to be just half as generous to the local banks
as to the British money-lender, and gave them £lOO
in notes for £97 in gold (the British money-lender got
£lOO paper for £94 gold) that would have meant a
bonus of £48,000 to the banks, which would make these
institutions feel good all over ; and the State would still
have saved £48,000 cash and £48,000 a year interest. And
if it liked to put £30,000 a year of the saving to a sinking
fund, to accumulate at 2J4 per cent., so as to create a
cash-reserve against these notes, the liability could be
wiped-out in 34 years without costing the State a copper.
And still the State would be £48,000 better off in immedi-
ate cash, and, during the 34 years while the sinking fund
was accumulating, it would be £lB,OOO a year better off,
and, when the 34 years had expired, it would be £48,000
a year better off for ever after in interest and £1,000,000
better off in the principal of its debt; and the banks would
have made a clear profit of £48,000. There is absolutely no
need for any sinking fund except to reassure an unaccus-
tomed public ; and the proposed £48,000 bonus to the
banks is pure bribery to buy off their opposition—but
even with these allowances there is a lot of money in the
idea. Also, these calculations are based on the assump-
tion that the State-note-issue system gave the Govern-
ment command of only £1,600,000, but, as a matter of
fact, it would, on the Canadian system, produce much
more. Of course if the State made a further rise by
suspending private note issues and substituting its own
notes, the money thus raised would cost a trifle per cent.,
being the amount of the lost note-tax—where there is one
(the highest is only 2 per cent). But the money raised
by requiring the banks to keep part of their reserves in
State notes would cost no interest whatever.

The best news that has come from Westralia for
a long, long time is the official announcement that the
wheat harvest is 857,362 bushels, as compared with
408 595 bushels last year. The yield is 11$ bushels to the
acre against 10$ bushels last season, so the increase is
mostly through increased acreage under crop. There is
far more substantial wealth in agriculture than in
trvim- to sell the elusive wild cat on the London
market Yet even now W.A., despite its huge area,
small population and great extent of rich, well-watered
land, doesn’t grow nearly enough wheat for its own con-
sumption ; in proportion to population it doesn t pro-
duce one-third as much as crowded Victoria. And this
year it will have to pay, out of its scarce supply of money,
for 529 000 bushels of imported wheat, when it ought to be-
the biggest exporter in the group. Tim ’groper’s capacity
for slumbering beside his rusted plough is something in-
credible. . „
F. E. Winchcombe, of Sydney, who is now run-
ning fora seat on A.M.P. directorate and wants to intro-
duce some new blood into the board, is an eminently
successful and trusted businessman ; and the biggest life-
assurance society in this hemisphere should afford just
the right field for his abundant energy. Eleven years ago
he was salesman to the old firm of Mort and Co. Now he
is senior partner in Winchcombe, Carson and Co., which
firm he founded, and which has grown up under his direc-
tion to be one of the principal wool institutions of Aus-
tralasia. Also he appeals tP A.M.P. members as a veteran

The Planet Permanent Building Society (Mel-
bourne), a large concern which has long been struggling
with its difficulties, announced that its operations
for 189 S had reduced the accumulated loss from .£11,823
to £9782. On the face of things this looked like a profit
of over £2OOO, but an inspection of the balance-sheet ap-
pears to knock this favorable impression endways. Some
time ago the Planet Co. surrendered its office-buildings to
the mortgagee under certain conditions, and he sold
them, apparently, for £5781 more than the.mortgage, and
this sum, being put in among the ordinary revenue, has
enabled the society to reduce its debt. The ordinary
revenue and expenditure for the year is as follows :
Expenditure. Receipts.
Interest .. .. ’.. £2814 Interest, &c., .. .. £3249
Management .. .. 1064 Loss .. 3740
Loss on properties
sold 3111
£6989 £6989
The profit on the sale of the society’s office building Gan
only happen once, and the loss on sales of foreclosed pro-
perties appears likely to go on for a long long time, for
out of £157,000 worth of alleged assets properties in pos-
session represent nearly £132,000. Anyhow, the Planet
isn’t earning enough to pay interest and working expenses.
Its deposits only cost it 2$ per cent, at present, and even
at that low rate it fails to make ends meet—the chief
cause of the difficulty being that its assets only yield
about 2 per cent., and they are all in pawn to another
building society. During the year it seems to have sold
property worth £9250 on paper, and realised £6141, and
if all the properties pan out like this, the loss on realisa-
tion of £132,000 worth will be £44,000.

The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the
United States publishes its report for 1898. Premiums
were £8,050,105 —an increase of more than £200,000 as
compared with 1897. Consideration for annuities
(£163,723) shows a decrease of £23,000. Interest and
rents (£2,177,289) show an increase of over £lOO,OOO. The
total income is £11,301,446, and the amount added to the
funds is £4,494,518. The Equitable’s total pile is now
£53,445,840, and the surplus of assets over liabilities is
£11,918,852. These are figures of great magnificence, yet
there are sundry contras to set against them. The surplus
appears to be arrived at by assuming a 4 per cent, future
rate of interest on the funds —so far as concerns
great part of the business at all events—and a society
which barely earns £4 ss. per cent on its mean
funds for the year has no right to assume any future
4 per cent. ; the margin is distinctly too narrow. A re-
duction of assumed interest rate to 3$ would still leave a
huge surplus, but it would be about £2,500,000 less than
it now is ; and a reduction to the much safer 3 per cent,
would further reduce the surplus to, probably, about
£7,000,001). That ought to be enough for any office, but
apparently the Equitable wants more. No less than
£455,794 of the assets consist of that debateable item,
“ Deferred premiums on' policies When paid semi-annually
or quarterly,” an item which would be much better
struck out bodily. And £910,329 of the income for 1898 (also
£273,765 of the income for ’97 and various sums in the in-
come of some other years) is made ujfof “Gain in Valuation
of assets.” This item suggests that the Equitable, when
its assets go up in market value, is very prompt in taking
advantage of the improvement, and though the process
is quite legitimate (and also helps to make the surplus
look bigger) it necessarily diminishes the margin of safety
in case of a general fall in values later on. The moral of
all which is that the Equitable is very progressive and
very large indeed, but that it suffers from an incurable
desire to look even larger than it is.

The Colonial Sugar Refining Co. buys cane now
in N.S.W. by the percentage of sugar it contains. Said
percentage is ascertained by its own staff by chemical
analysis, concerning which the co. gives the farmer no
information. Last year on the Clarence the results
were below growers’ anticipations, and the Farmers’
Union asked that a check on the analysis by a comparison
of the output of sugar should be permitted. The co. re-
turned an evasive reply, and didn’t budge. When pay-
ment by analysis was introduced in connection with
damaged cane two years ago, a mass meeting of farmers
asked the Premier to send a Govt, expert to check the
co’s analj’sis, but nothing eventuated then either. The
co’s method of purchasing cane by its own private valua-
tion in its own laboratories appears to call for legislative
interference.

The report of the Engineer-in-Chief of N.S.W.
Works Department ought to be comforting reading for
Broken Hill Water Supply shareholders. The local
municipal council asked for a report on a possible rival
scheme, the Yanco Glen. Mr. Darley thinks very little of
it (it is true he is accused on the spot of making only a
superficial examination), but admits that the water-
charges of the existing co. are heavy. He remarks,
however (as The Bulletin has done several times), that a
co. which has to hand over its expensive works within
about 25 years of their completion without compensation
cannot afford to make ordinary profits. The suggestion
is, therefore, made that the co.’s rights should be
extended ; but a local suggestion, that the co. should be
bought out now and the sinking-fund spread over a
larger number of years, is likely to be more favored. The
co. isn’t at all likely to be given rating powers ; but if the
works were made public property those powers would be
the very first thing secured.

Cobar notes.— Cobar Gold Mines very leisurely
approaches the time for its big start. In a few weeks its
term of exemption from labor conditions will have ex-
pired, and then something really life-like must be done or
workmen set to kill time. The warden has declared that
he will grant no further exemption. The Chesney still
very quiet. Someone must be receiving a thumping
screw to mop up the £5OO a month which is said to be
spent—and, after all, what is £5OO a month in so big a
mine ? The Great Western has a faint hope of passing
into new hands. The mine is good, but has been sadly
butchered, and a new management would need a few
thousands to spare to overcome difficulties created by the
present board of directors.

A miner writes to The Bulletin from Clermont
Queensland “ When I arrived here last year, and started
to work at timber-cutting in the bush, I was surprised
to find what I took for bike-tracks all over the place.
They turned out to be the tracks of the jigger-man’s
wheelbarrow. Nearly every old fossicker here owns a
dog, a wheelbarrow and a dry jigger. He starts out in the
morning, fixes his jigger, and puts through a load of dirt •
sometimes he does not obtain a color. Then he shiftsaway
and sets up again in a fresh place, very likely with the
same result. Often they trundle their barrows 10
to 12 miles per day, setting up in three or
four places during the day; they keep this up
for weeks without finding anything, when they may drop
upon a patch which will keep them going for another few
weeks. The majority of the fossickers here have been on
Clermont diggings for over a quarter of a century, and
have very old-fashioned notions re the distribution of the
gold. They imagine that there are no payable leads in
the cement, despite the fact that nearly all the recently-
discovered leads were found in it. All the old rich
leads that have been worked on this field were
found in soft alluvial formed by the disintegration of
the cement, and its concentration in recently-formed
gullies. The cement fills up old deep watercourses
which run in opposite directions to the present gullies
and sometimes through made hills, but there are no
surface indications to assist the prospector to sink, there-
fore there has been very little prospecting done in the
cement. The Clermont goldfield has, therefore, great
possibilities before it yet—there are four or five hundred
sq. miles of cement country not yet prospected—and it
Appears to me to be the source of all the alluvial gold that
has been won so far. The country rock is slate, permeated
with unmineralised white quartz leaders, containing no
gold. There are a few payable reefs at Copperfield and
McDonald Flat, but that is only a small portion of the
Clermont goldfield. The so-called Venus reef is simply a
dyke carrying gold in a big formation of lode stuff, without
sign of quartz. Writer never saw anything of the kind
before. It has never been properly worked, and is worth
a fair trial. An old man has been working it with a pestle
and mortar for .years and making a living out of it, but
his tailings are as coarse as pumpkin-seeds.

For March, 1899, Queensland crushed 1-11,518
tons of quartz for 84,2580 z. Alluvial gave 21170 z. Total,
86,3750 z increase of 11,9030 z. on March output for
’9B. Of this total Charters Towers gave 17,5100 z. from
16,822 tons of quartz, and 22,0260 z. from 48,347 tons of
tailings. Croydon—9ls7oz. for 4985 tons quartz ; 31200 z.
from 2160 tons tailings. Gympie output—9244oz. from
11,935 tons of quartz ; 6030 z. from 1035 tons of tailings.
Mt. Morgan gave 15,085pz. from 17,167 tons crushed
(tailings, 806 oz.). Clermont’s alluvial showed a big falling
off—only 13340 z. for March this year against 31420 z. for
March, ’9B. Etheridge production 15730 z. from 1459
tons of quartz. Towers’ calls, £3773 ; divs., £29,760.

Tin was first found in Queensland in 1872. In
’73 the metal was produced to the value of £606,184. In
’97, value of tin raised was only £37,509. Returns for ’9B
not yet accessible. As the price of tin recently rose to
£lO9 per ton, there should be better times ahead for the
industry. According to Geologist Skertchley, the future
of the Montalbion and Herberton districts must of neces-
sity depend on tin rather than copper. According to the
same authority, until the discovery of the Australian tin-
fields not a single tin-discovery of note had taken place
since the Christian era. Cornwall was worked in the time
of the Romans; the Straits Settlements’ mines can be
traced back to the ninth century, and were supposed to
be very old then.

per or silver. Two batteries and cyanide plants are

day, and the whole of the product will subsequently be

Westralia hasn’t many kicks to spare for any-
thing just now, but one of those that it has left is being
given to some proffered mine-tribute conditions. Tribut-
ing is a pretty poor game at the best. Except here and
there it is sweating written another way; and when it
isn’t that, it is often landlordism in a bad form. Up on the
Murchison thingshave about reached their worst. The Cue
Consolidated (English, of course), which owns a big group
of mines and alleged ditto, offers any of them on conditions
that the trihutor puts down the main shaft 10ft. a month,
and does 10ft. of development work for every 100
tons of payable ore broken. To the man who
has to depend on wages this is dust and ashes.
Companies that have to sit back and get their
main workings made on conditions like these are ripe
for liquidation ; and the mining industry would be
the better for the change of ownership of leases which
that would involve. What it means is that the co. can’t
make a “do” of the mines itself; but it hangs on, and
draws rent from somebody who has either to take them
on the co.’s terms or go dry-blowing—and still stands in
to reap the richest harvest in the end.
Of course, the C.C. being Hinglish, the superior
local person is saying that if miners don’t accept offers
like this they deserve to go dry-blowing. “ The condi-
tions do not meet with the approval of those who think
that tributors should take up a mine, extract the ore
opened up by the co., and then leave.” What happens,
as a matter of fact, is that the co. takes out all the ore
that it can while paying day-wages, and, when the stuff
gets so poor that it can’t make any profit that way, it
turns-on the tributor. He doesn’t get wages ; he has the
privilege of taking out what it doesn’t pay the co. to
handle “ on its own,” and pays a percentage for the privi-
lege of doing so. Also the co. always stands to have
something better exposed in its mine than the unprofit-
able face upon which the tributor starts.

Mildura, the Vic. irrigation settlement
which was established on no-drink principles, and
whose exports consist mainly of dried apricots,
deputations and empty beer-bottles, has had
another municipal vote on the great pub. question.
Nearly five years ago this question was answered
by 283 votes for the Gothenburg system against
77 for ordinary pub. licenses and 9 for total pro-
hibition ; but the settlers were then too busy
chasing the people who had undertaken to supply
them with water and weren’t doing it to trouble
much about other liquor. Now, however, the
channels are occasionally full, and the considera-
tion of bulk beer is again possible. The vote
which has resulted shows almost as strong a feel-
ing as before in favor of municipal pub.-keeping ;
and the Vie. Govt, is to be petitioned accordingly.

Gov. Brassey actually fell off at tennis in

neck, and the newspapers reported the sad happen-

sistent faller-off, Brassey has no living equal. He
has been falling off ever since he came to Aus-

strapped down on the broad of his back in the
dead middle and centre of the Old Man Plain,
he would contrive to fall off within an hour. He

When the jury found Kelly, arraigned for
the murder of Maria Flynn, guilty of man-
slaughter only, he devoutly made the sign of the
cross in the dock. Kelly was probably praying
for the soul of his saviour, Briggs, whose hanging
on the previous day for an offence pretty well on
all-fours with his own so impressed the jurors with
their personal responsibility that they shrank from
finding a logical verdict, i.e. , assuming that the
Briggs verdict was logical. Briggs clearly paid
for both. And who knows that Mr. Kelly was
not also saying a little prayer for John Norton,
whose fiery denunciations of murdered Maria
Flynn’s other friend, Mr. Pat Carey, raised among
a large section of the Sydney community a feeling
of sympathy for the deluded prisoner in the dock ?

Rev. “heretic” Ferguson is going to be
theologically snuffed out by Melb. Presbytery,
which is about the most desirable thing that could
happen to such a very half-and-half sort of
Thinker. The orthodox committee have reported
on Ferguson’s little book, and the report, ridicul-
ous as it is in its own conceits concerning Terewtb,
puts the wishy-washy rebel beyond the pale of
rational sympathy. For the preacher who doesn’t
go the whole dog-ma, or none, there is no particu-
lar place in the church (whichever church he may
belong to) or out of it.
In view of the
alleged unbathing
propensities of the
modern Australi-
enne, The Bulle-
tin notes that the
young ladies of
Rookwood (N. S.
Wales) recently pe-
titioned the local
Council to allow
them the use of the
Hampden baths on
Sunday afternoon,
on the plea that
their avocations
prevent their tak-
ing advantage of
the ladies’ hours on
week-days. Where-
upon the horrified
Council ejaculated
the dreadful ex-
pression “ Conti-
nental,” and was
forthwith dumb.
But why shouldn’t
the girls bathe on
Sunday?

“ I don’t like the looks of that gentleman,
yer honor,” said a prisoner recently tried before
Vic. Justice Hodges. “ That gentleman ” was a
bald-headed juror, who accordingly stood down
and sat out the trial, and, when his critic was
found guilty and sentenced, looked as pleased as
if he’d happened on a genuine hair-restorer. The
prisoner in this case was very deaf, and when the
Judge asked—“ Can you hear what the witness is
saying ?” replied, “No, your Honor, but I knoiv
he’s telling a pack of lies ! ”
A troubled Syd-
ney matron answered
one of the advts.:
“Ladies, why suffer?
A sure, safe and na-
tural remedy for all
female ailments, no
noxious drugs ; fee,
10s. 6d. Apply,” etc.
By return post she
was advised to mo-
theran infant as soon
as possible,and nurse
it —which confirmed
the previous advice
of her own medical
attendant.
The man Charlie, or Mahomet Ali, lying
under sentence of death in Wagga, is an example
of the maniacal effects of opium. This is by no
means common, the runners- 11 amok ” being gener-
ally mad from “bhang,” a decoction of hemp.
It is asserted by the advocates of opium-intoxica-
tion that it is a great preventive of crime, the
awful reaction and suffering, when stopped in
gaol, being so well known as to be a deterrent.
The writer knows one opium-eater whose coat-
edges and corners are padded with supplies of
opium-seconds, as a stand-by in case he should be
imprisoned. And after all they would take his
opium-lined suit from him and put him in prison-
livery.
Apropos, in N.S. Wales the interpreter’s trans-
lation of the Judge’s sentence, with its grave
peroration, is “Fhansi hoga ” — i.e., “ There will
be hanging.” Very explicit and curtailed of un-
necessary padding, but not & la Madden or Darley.

Coolgardie’s exhibition was a pitiable frost
all through. The City of Tinned Dog was never
large enough for an exhibition, anyhow, and its
glory has faded of late, and the hotel-accommoda-
tion isn’t sufficient for a big exhibition crowd, and
it lacks water to wash a big crowd, and the dust
is gruesome and the scenery repellent. Westralia
has little of its own to exlii bit except models of
nuggets, timber, empty meat-tins, a fevv gaunt,
bony vegetables, sundry tough cows, the inevit-
able wool, some coal, the beer from the breweries
run by eastern capital, and photographs of “in-
dentured ” niggers working in chains. Nobody
from outside cared much about expensively hump-
ing goods to the W.A. interior; it is all very
good to push business when there is a chance of
getting paid for the goods, but W.A. has little to
give in return now except the green and ever-
flourishing bad-debt. Coolgardie municipal coun-
cil raised one arch by way of decoration when the
melancholy, half-empty show started, and the
Afghan camel-drivers shouted another. The rest
was mainly drink, and lonesomeness, and roulette
tables, and Aunt Sallies. The exhibition was
more like a moderate-sized general-store than any-
thing else, and even the Tinned-Dog City hardly
professed to be glad over it, though it rose man-
fully with sixpenn’orth of beer in its right hand
and made speeches wherein the ring of enthusi-
asm sounded like a big door-key falling into a
tomb.
Ooolgardie people now shiver when Exhi-
bition is mentioned. On the eve of the opening,
when Gov. Smith and Premier Forrest were pack-
ing their portmanteaux to give the thing a shove,
there was an unruly meeting to discuss whether
the Mayor of Coolgardie should be allowed £250
“ for the entertainment of distinguished visitors”
while the frost lasted. The proposal was carried,
of course, but only amid general remarks that
they didn’t know where “the stuff” was to come
from. And, anyhow, the spectacle of Coolgardie,
which lately flowed witli fizz, deciding to allow its
Mayor a whole £250 to “ do the honors ’’ is full of
sadness.
But Coolgardie Exhibition has one accessory
novelty, anyhow : a camel - firm (Afghan, of
course) is keeping a string of riding camels in
town ; and the incautious, curious visitor can have
his head jerked off for a shilling or so.

STARS
IN THE
SEA
FOR THE BULLETIN.
I took a boat on a starry 'night
And went for a row on the water,
And she danced like a child on her wake
of light,
And bowed where the ripples caught
her.
I vowed as I rowed on the velvet blue
Through the night and the starry
splendour,
To woo and sue a maiden I knew
Till she bent to my pleadings tender.
My painted boat she was light and glad,
And gladder my heart with wishing,
And I came in time to a little lad
Who stood on the rocks a-fishing.
I said “ Ahoy ! ” and he said “ Ahoy 1 ”
And I asked how the fish were biting—
“ And what are you trying to catch, my boy,
Bream, silver and red —or whiting ? ”
“Neither,” he answered; “ the seaweed mars
My line, and the sharp shells sunder —
I am trying my luck with those great, big stars
Down there in the round skies under.”
Good-bye from him, and good-bye from me.
And never a laugh came after ;
So many go fishing for stars in the sea
That it’s hardly a subject for laughter.

The recent murder of a seven-year-old boy
by his mother at Fisherman’s Bend, Melb., recalls
the cold-blooded act for which Emma Williams
was hanged under Gov. Brassey’s first official

and, deciding that he was superfluous, took him
to Port Melb. lagoon, tied a big stone his
neck by a piece of braid, and tossed him in. That

A young man of about 29 told a strange
tale last week in Melb. County Court. He said
that he had been working for a blacksmith for
over 10 years, the agreement being for 15s. a week
with board, lodging, and clothing ; but his em-
ployer never paid him, and always spanked him
in a vigorous, fatherly manner when he asked
for the money. The blacksmith being dead
now, he was suing the executors for 10 years’
wages. About this stage the Judge showed signs
of falling into a state of insensibility, but he held
up with a great effort, and denounced the case as
the most incredible hen-and-cow narrative that
ever wandered into his court. The man who said
he was spanked off and on for ten years was then
shunted out with costs.

“ Dubberkelosity ” is manifestly going to

Dubberkulous character. When two Iydies dis-
agree in Richmond or Oollingwood now the last

the battery begins is “ Dubberke.” Then the next
remark consists of a handful of hair and a shriek
and a wrecked hat.

“T.D.” : Went (for a

Sydney hotel on Sunday and met
at the bar a plain-clothes officer who
was ministering to a cultured taste in tangle-
foot. Half-an-hour previously he told me that
he was “watching the pubs.”
On inquiry I found that his
mate (they run in couples) was
having a gratis whisky and a
simultaneous flirtation with the
cook in the kitchen. A week
before, those two policemen
had the gall to “fix” a neigh-
boring vendor of soulful beverages
for a fine of £5.
A Richmond (Melb.) boot-manufacturer
has got a dreadful showing-up at the local court.
It was his pleasant little custom to pay his em-
ployes the statutory wage, as enacted under the
Factories Act, at 10 a.m. on Saturdays. These
wages they duly signed for, and immediately
handed back to the manager. Then, at knocking-
off time, about noon, they were paid their
regular wages—considerably under the legal
scale. The employer's lawyer offered to plead
guilty, and wished to be heard in mitigation
of sentence without the evidence being taken.
The local J’sP., for a wonder, went into
the matter carefully, and then sat on this
interesting gentleman to the tune of =£s ss. fine,
with <£s ss. costs, in the two cases listed. It was
a good deal for a J.P. to do, but, as the boot-
manufacturer has probably defrauded his workmen
out of a good many times the amount of the paltry
fine, he is still better off through breaking the law
than he would be if he had kept it.

The selection of N.S.W. District Court
Judge Gibson for an Acting Supreme Court
Judgeship is adversely remarked upon by certain
legal critics, not on personal grounds, but because
such appointments tend to obliterate the line of
demarcation between the two benches. But the
trend of the last decade in N.S.W. is in the direc-
tion of doing this very obliteration, and, it is
held, the distinction between the benches never
should have been so wide in emoluments and
honor as it is. Several D.C. have been Acting
Supreme Court Judges. If fit to be Acting, why
not fit to be permanent ?
This is to give notice that Australian
Governors are not responsible for any psvate
debts contracted by their haydekongs.

“ M‘G.” : How is it that so few artists can
draw a “ lady ” in the snobbish sense of the
word? Phil May’s women, like those of
all the leading black-and-white men of
the world, all look damsels of the
most lively sort, and seem to
have stepped from behind a bar
into the middle of Phil’s draw-
ings. Souter’s creations are the
same, only more so, for no man
would hesitate to pass a wink
to any of his decorative girls,
and vvould do so with the
certainty of having that wink
returned. Spence is better
but in trying to make his
girls respectable he errs on
t’otherside and presents
them as demure and seri-
ous as a parcel of Chinese
missionaries. “Sas,”
Williams and even Yin-
cent are not so careful
of the apparent morals
of their creations as
they should be, and
Ambrose Dyson’s are
all utterly beyond the
pale—as the rising
Ambrose certainly
means them to be.
A world composed
of the women that
local artists build
would result in the
North Melb. Court
sitting all day and
night, and the
Yarra being so full
of boot-trunks that
the casual citizen
would have to drown
his superfluous pup in the bath.
In a Northern town, recently, a wife-v.-

other herself. Bond fixed up, and hubby goes
back to the bosom of his family. But, alas ! same

“ stretch,” and Madame is mulct in <£so and has

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, April 10, 1899.
Mr Dear Myek—
Govt. House ball came off last Thursday. Seven
hundred people can’t all develope in the narrow
V.R. ballrooms, and only a few danced, and many
were never seen at all. The girl who “comes
out ” at Govt. House doesn’t get a rosy impression
of the great, gay world. She generally stands up
half the evening, and sits down the other half.
The woman of 30, with her circular glance, is the
one who makes the ball her own. The young girl
in her new white satin, new white shoes, new
white gloves, new white bouquet-strings, and
fatally new unpractised smile, does what George
Moore says—evokes no ideal but that of home;
and, as hoiiie isn’t what dancing-men look for in
ball-rooms, she is left at her mother’s side for the
most part. By the way, Thursday’s prettiest
debutante was Miss Vera le Patourel, whose elder
sister is one of Sydney’s acknowledged beauties.
The frocking was characterised by the polonaise,
and the sequined net. Lady Darley was wearing
black satin embroidered in steel, and her daughters,
in blacks and' greys, were white and wan-looking
after their hard week’s work. “The Chief”
and Mr. B. R. Wise ran a calf-com petition in
which the latter was wofully beaten, but all the
other men in the room wore clothes to their boots.
Mrs. Percy Chirnside glittered in a diamond tiara
and silvered net over sky-blue. Mrs. Willie
Mitchell, whose frocks are always expected to
prophesy fashions, was not there. The Madden
bride, Mrs. Harry Osborne, added to her reputa-
tion of being the largest, serenest, happiest-looking
bride of the day, in white brocade with big white
buttons down the back of the skirt, and diamond
swallows in her hair.
' A travelling celebrity created a sensation
(and much envy) by asking a pretty Syd-
ney woman who can’t breathe in the inner
of inners, and isn’t reckoned to be in society,
to dance with him. He seemed to like his
partner, too. At last, another pretty woman
couldn’t stand it any longer. She moved forward,
and boldly bailed up the celebrity in the doorway.
“ Oh, how do you do ? ” said she, loudly. “ I was
so sorry our dance didn’t come off last night. Now,
which one are we going to have to-night ? ” He
blames his memory, but
The other big hop of the week, St. Vincent’s
ball, was somehow not the crowded dance it
usually is. At nine o’clock the hall looked quite
forlorn, but everybody comes late now, and about
450 folk were there eventually. I made a special
note of one part of the decorations, with a view to
warning anyone not to do it again. The" platform
was covered with drain-pipes, draped in white
stuff, and out of the white grew a gum-tree or a
palm. From the other end of the room it was like
a little cemetery taken out to have some fun—not
a cheerful bit of symbolism for a hospital ball.
There was the usual forinal set of Lancers, when
all the Everybodies, who must be deadly tired of
the other Everybodies, danced with Everybody.
Lady Darley, in black silk and jet and a diamond
star, looked regal beyond any genuine V.R. lady
that has ruled at Sydney, and, as isn’t always the
case, the male element further underlines the
aristocratic suggestions. Lord Hampden used to
go through these opening festivities with a weary
smile on one side of his mouth as though he knew
something about Sydney people that he would
never, Never tell ; but the fine, massive, Roman-
father-looking Acting-Governor Darley beams
graciously through the advance and retreat, and
sets to partners with a 1 vely combination of ducal
dignity and angelic smile.
As a dance, the ball was entirely successful.
The usual series of hungry-eyed women in pink
satin (there seems to be an idea that pink satin
will yet do something for the dear, good women
who are never asked to dance) looking wistfully
for a man with the magic query, “Are you en-
gaged for this ?” were not to be seen. Men rushed
about imploring dances, and this sort of thing lent
point and brilliancy to the smart frocks present.
Miss Slattery’s deep rose-pink silk was a gown
that could not be overlooked. It was made with
a polonaise that revealed pink-chiffon petticoats,
and a deeper-rose-pink velvet lifting up the cor-
sage. Fair-haired Mrs. Dicken showed that
blondes also can wear cerise. Her frock sounds
patchy on paper, but was striking in the real—a
pink glace polonaise edged with black chiffon-
ruches, over a striped black-and-pink petticoat,
and a white chiffon and black chenille bodice with
pink zouaves. A large lady in a black skirt and a
little white sleeveless coat wasn’t a happy
picture, neither was a pair of red silk gloves on
the arms of a girl in burning red with a coffin out-
lined in white lace on the skirt. These decora-
tions are a mockery when nobody restrains them.
The hon. secs., Mrs. Mullins and Mrs. Kenna,
worked hard in blue brocade and pink roses, and
in a white frilly frock with a touch of red velvet —
of all combinations the most becoming. Mrs.
Slattery, hon. treasurer, wore a grey poplin polo-
naise over pink underskirt. Mrs. Lovely sported
the only pair of red shoes present—under a plain
black net frock, which consisted chiefly of dia-
monds. Miss Ethel Inglis was in white silk with
a blue shoulder-bow.
The Broughs had another great house on Satur-
day, vice-regal command night. Potts Point and
country “Easter Eggs” alike finished up their
Easter revelries at “ Sans-Gene. ” The house was
even more brilliant than on opening night. In the
front row of the Governor’s box sat Sir Frederick
and Lady Darley, with a bright red figure—that
of Lady Ranfuriy in scarlet silk—between them.
Behind them were the Misses Darley, big, red-
faoed Harry Darley, a quiet-looking woman with
a charming smile, Captain Feil den, and a Ranfurly
aide with a blue collar. As for the circle, from
front row to back it was a continual succession of
“parties,” and it was easy to see that flowers have
come to stay in the hair.
Naturally, the piece went briskly and inspiredly,
with loud applause and many flowers. Mrs.
Brough was warmly worked-up, but had got over
the nervous exuberance of her opening night. How
charming she looks in that adorable brown “Em-
pire ” with bright green sleeves and bright green
zouave ! The worst of Mrs. Brough is that when
a house laughs and applauds, she does a little more.
And if they still laugh, she does a little more—
which is too much. For instance, in the tram
scene. That went “ big ” on Saturday, but even
a washerwoman would have to practise very hard
before she could tumble over her skirts so persist-
ently. Mrs. Brough’s other snappy frock is a
white satin that allows her to draw up her figure
to perfection. Long lines of gold embroideries
run all over the front of this creation,
which is cut a good way down to reveal a
shapely back. All through the play she
carries a little rolled-up ball of a handkerchief
which she waves by way of finis to a stormy scene,
dabs against her face when sentiments have been
flying round, and sticks to generally as if she
could not get on without it.
Mr. Lovell’s reputation as a handsome man
having arrived before him has probably injured
him seriously. He is tall, thin, dark, and a
striking replica of Cyril Keightly, the rather stiff
young Australian who played Mario to Potter’s
last performance of Tosca. Strangely enough,
Lovell has the same slightly-impeded speech, as
though some of his words were forced down his
throat instead of coming out through his lips. It
is only at intervals that you can hear without
straining, and this somewhat detracts from his
merits as an actor.
Pattie Browne’s benefit ran along on oiled
wheels last Thursday. An enormous house
gathered early—over £3OO worth of people—
and Pattie capped a brightly variegated pro-
gramme with a smarter “ few, words ” than the
usual ebullition of the overcome benefitted one.
Perhaps the speech was a trifle too comprehensive
for an impromptu effort, but it was delivered with
such happy archness that one forgave. In a high-
waisted empire frock, with a red wig and gold
sash ribbons, looking a little thinner after her ill-
ness, she gently buttered up the Firm, patted
“Goodie” metaphorically on the back, rubbed
some mild grease over Harry Rickards and his co.,
poured a whole bottle of oil on Charles Holloway
—a brother Australian —promised the house that
she would win more and more London laurels for
dear Australia., and finally piled words on words
in praise of the generosity of her country’s press.
Good Pattie ! There wasn’t an ounce of spleen in
the whole of the composition, and there might
have been reason for a little.
Said Pattie : “When Mr. Harry Rickards was
asked if he would assist at my benefit, he ex-
claimed, ‘ What, Pattie 1 Why, if it’s Pattie she
can have my theatre, my company, my home, my
wife, my children, myself /” Rumor has been
whispering for a long time of the ructions between
Harry Pattie all through the latter’s season,
and this little dished-up speech may stop gossip.
It was said that Pattie blamed Rickards’ manage-
ment for her bad season. But there can’t be much
ill-blood where a man offers to give himself in
with his family.
The programme rattled along without a hitch.
Charles Kenningham, looking like Launcelot of
1899 in round cheeks and eyes, and a long-tailed
coat, shed on a ballad the head notes that always
smite the house dumb with admiration. A clever
little prodigy, named Fanny Powers, relieved one’s
mind by singing a childish little song about dolls
instead of drunken men. Lottie Moore’s delight-
ful somersault showed a Frenchy black skirt with
big yellow flowers on it whirling away from legs
crossed with yellow ribbons. Pattie gave all too
little of herself in the brief, bright letter-scene
from the “ Country Girl. ” Walter Bentley brought
all his art and all his nature to bear on “Eugene
Aram, ” but the world is passing on, and leaving
Eugene behind it.
The general opinion concerning the Passion
Play exhibition of pictures at the Town Hall last
Friday was that there was tqo much Bentley and
not enough Passion Play about. True art in a
performance of the kind consists in leading the
audience to forget the personality of the lecturer.
The unstinted applause that greeted the actor’s
ranting delivery of some of the most sacred pas-
sages of Scripture was a trifle disconcerting, even
to many persons not over-reverent; and several
devout people arose and left the building, so com-
pletely shocked were they at such an exhibition of
bad taste. A rather weird effect was achieved by
the sipging, in almost complete darkness, of more
or less relevant songs.
Much sympathy is felt with Mr. Leonard Gib-
son, of this city, whose popular and much-admired
wife died so suddenly up North the other day.
Mrs. Gibson was a daughter of the late Mr. Far-
quhar, of Mort’s Dock, and used to be known as
the handsome Miss Tempe Farquhar. Strangely
enough, Mr. Farquhar died suddenly some years
ago from a chill contracted in a freezing-room,
while Mrs. Gibson died while bathing in a very
cold water-hole, supposedly from heart-failure.
She had gone North on a visit to her sister.
Captain Sloan-Stanley, late aide to the Hamp-
dens, lias gone from the battle with the Fat
Butchers’ Wives to active service in Africa. Lord
Beauchamp, who is bringing out three aides and
a secretary, may regret that Capt. Fielden is not
to stay on. This aide’s colonial experience and
nice, neat melancholy would be a ready-made
fence for keeping baok people whose friends and
relatives are not kind enough to restrain them. To
be able to gaze sadly at an infuriated hash-house
Eresidentess, asking “ ’Ow is it I’ve been left
out o’ the ball?” is really a great gift for a
diplomat.
The last, though not the youngest, of the late
Dr. Leibius’ daughters was married last week.
The bride was pretty, auburn-haired Miss Julie
Leibius, and the bridegroom Mr. Reginald Heber
Bode, second son of the late Rev. C. Bode. The
ceremony, which took place on March 29 at
Gladesville, was rather quietly performed.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“The assistant staff at St. Vincent’s Hospital
fair is less motley than most gatherings of bazaar
banditti. Instead of fancy-dress hotch-potch, all
wear gay gowns with white caps and aprons.
Each group affects frocks of the same color and its
own special cap-shape, the latter in some cases an
idealised, picturesque version of one or another
conventional head-dress.
“T-he second Mrs. Wesley-Hall, at Toorak
stall, wore on Easter Monday night black brocade
skirt, boldly-blended black-and-white blouse,
cream ostrich boa, and black and grey metallic
millinery. Mesdames Edward Miller, Robert
Power, Nicholas Fitzgerald, and surgeon Fitz-
gerald’s daughter all turned an honest penny at
the same booth.
“As usual, their R.C. reverences have the
father of a good time at the fair. Colleens
literally mobbed them the first night or two,
especially crisp young curates, with a killing
glance and a soft answer to turn away the wrath
of every baffled bargainer in petticoats within
blarneying distance. One such broth of a bhoy
was tall, fair, and curly, with a divil of a dimple ;
another short and swarthy, with comic nose and
twinkling black eye.
“The male Paddy flirts from the cradle to the
frave. His womankind, on the contrary, are
rought up demurely, set a high value on them-
selves, and frequently get left. The old man
declares, in expansive moments, he’d rather see
‘me daughter in her grave, than running after
any starveling in breeches. ’
“Miss He'pner, youngest and comeliest of the
new faces in ‘Belle of New York,’appeals more
forcibly to the front rows of the stalls than to
friends at a distance. Hers is the cosy, comfort-
ing type of young womanhood. Take an inch or
two off her height and she would pass for one of
the bunch of Chief-Justice Madden’s daughters.
“ ‘Belle ’ Louise Hepner is an acquired taste,
evidently, and catches on more and more,
especially with the sex which relishes down-cast
eyes and up-raised ankles—mixed drinks, so to
speak. En passant , the charmer in question told
a local press-reporter that her boofy red-brown
plait is shop-hair, bought ‘ at a store on Broad-
way.’ Among the throng at a recent ‘ Belle ’
matinee was Mrs. Bland Holt (in smart tailor suit
and red hat) with Hubby and Miss Lucy Coppin.
“ But the chief beauties of ‘ The Belle
of New York ’ are in the choruses. But Natalie
Olcott and Lily Cooley, Yankee chorus girls,
are nice to look at through opera - glasses.
They are good-sized girls, turned in a good lathe,
and perfect models, whether from the painter’s or
the sculptor’s point of view.
“ As for ‘ Wine and Women, ’ the latter, with all
their faults, are dressy specimens. Mrs. Bland
Holt returns from her honeymoon with her Eton-
jacketed bridegroom in yellow muslin, hooped from
neck to hem with diagonal circles of black lace
quillings. She sees the Longchamps steeplechase
in white satin, sleeved and chemisetted with satin-
striped gauze, the apron and corsage outlined with
silver pendants. Another gown has emerald satin
bodice, jewelled-chiffon sleeves and gauze-veiled
skirt. Elizabeth Watson, as an extra-naughty
‘ (lay Parisienne,’ is smartest at the races in one of
the new black velvet ‘ swallow-tail ’ coats, with
scoop cuffs dipping to the knuckles of her white
gloves, plain, clinging, magpie-striped silk skirt,
silver beaded black stick, etc. Frances Ross, with
innocent curls a-hanging down her back, hat rib-
bons tied under chin, roses nestling in belt, etc.,
hugger-muggers an old, blind man till he can’t
call his soul his own, kissing his hand, stroking
his thin grey hair, and shooting him out of
draughts.
“ Had the Town Hall been half as large again,
it would probably still have been a tight fit for
the Amy Castles concert crush. As it was, many
reserved seats were jumped and held on to, and
many would-be hearers took their money back and
went disappointed away. Throughout the general
fizz and fuss the blithe young beneficiare kept a
stiff upper lip, looking very winsome as she came
forward for her first plunge, simply frocked in
white, her dark hair framing her flushed cheeks,
her eye steely-bright with suppressed excitement.
Of course ‘ she’s but a lassie ! ’ —no finished singer.
On Saturday night, the audience would have en-
joyed itself better and sampled the voice under
review just as well, had the heroine of the occasion
been heard in less ambitious music.
“ Nevertheless the gifted young thing received
a regular ovation, got piles of flowers, and alto-
gether made one of those slap-dash debuts com-
moner in books than in real life.
“At that concert I witnessed a Horrible
Calamity. A matron, whose chair had been
pushed forward into a lone, lorn, prominent posi-
tion, little knew, poor thing, that a white under-
garment, badly-torn too, worse luck ! had worked
up at the back, above her decollete corsage. Girls
sat behind her and giggled, and behind them
again, drinking in their jokes, writhed their butt’s
hubby, purple to his hair-roots, as visible on the
thinnish patches.
“Wallace Brownlow, who helped with the pro-
gramme, is still large and fair, though his English
roses, alas, have wilted by the way. Daughters
of Israel, in Saturday’s audience, reminisce regret-
fully of his beauty in ‘Ma Mie Rosette. ’ Miss
Leonora Bailey, in black ; white-gowned Meta
Blaubaum : and clever Zelinan, junior, with his
violin, were the other performers.
“Evidently His Ex. the Governor has quite
enough brains to keep him out of the wet.
When the officers’ mess tent at Langwarrin en-
campment sprang sundry small leaks m the roof,
Lord Brassey rose —or rather, he went down—to
the occasion by crawling under the table for
shelter. He didn’t stay there long enough to feel
lonely, the story says, and he came back into the
open looking all the better for his trip. For a
Governor who wanted to make sure of being dry
there could be no safer place than underneath the
table ; besides, it gave the distinguished guest a
chance to assure himself that none of the ladies
present had got their little feet damp.
“Melb. University has lost one of its oldest
identities. John Selby, who acted as assistant to
the anatomical lecturers and manager of the de-
funct department for the past 14 years, is returning
to his native London. Previous to his University
‘appointment,’ as the fruity-voiced old character
would call it, Selby put in eight years of attend-
ance upon surgeons at the operating-theatre of
Melb. Hospital, and he goes back ’Ome with a
decent bit o’ money in his pocket, feeling very
much like a fully-qualified scientist, or words to
that effect. Although he can remember the time
when there were not more than 20 medical students
at the University, and lady doctors, bless your
’art, wasn’t thought of, Selby is not an ardent
Tory. He reckons that the gals are ahead of the
young fellers—’cos why ? The young fellers is
mostly thinking about crick-et and /oot-ball,
where-as the gals goes to the University to work.
That’s about the size of it, sez John Selby, and
when his friends in London ask him what he thinks
of wimmin for doctors, he will intimate that the
wimmin are all right as far as they’ve gorne.
“ Marshall Hall was badly broken up about the
death of his friend, clever Ernest Moffitt. He
would not leave the cemetery after the funeral,
but asked to be left alone there, and stayed for an
hour or more pacing beside the grave. Hall is a
good man in a fight—a hard-hitting enemy—but
he is a firm friend. Such friendships as lie has
made among men of his set in Melbourne one
hears of in books, but very rarely encounters in
actual life.
“A sad circumstance in connection with that
Port Phillip yachting disaster was that two
daughters of the family, who were on a holiday at
Xmas, drove on Thursday morning to the railway
station to meet two of their brothers who were to
have come up—to receive instead a telegram
announcing the death of father and f.our
brothers.
“Melbourne’s dozen Chinese she-missionaries
are berthed in a>big terrace-house in Gore-
street, Fitzroy. On Sundays and sundry week-
evenings the twelve tall, pale, anaemic-looking
virgins file out of Gore-street and walk slowly and
smilelessly to Lilly Buk-street, clad in blue
dresses, with white collars and cuffs, and Dub-
berke hats with blue and white ribbons, and
turned out altogether in a manner which would be
fetching with any other sort of girls. They are
nearly all young, but at first glance look 40 at
least, and nearly all have figures strikingly mas-
culine.
“Be the mention of Prof. Marshall-Hall rubbing
shoulders with the black - shawled Sisters of
Charity, in the noble cause of charity-concerts,
many people will be staggered to hear that Holy
Church and the Chair of Music are on the best of
terms. The other Sunday night, at one of Dr.
Tom Bride’s literary and musical soirees at Kew,
the loose-lipped lyrist sat cheek by jowl to
Jesuit Father Ryan. The two poles represented
by the agnostic baton-beater and the shriver of
souls met in, no—on —harmony. They talked
music till the Prof, forgot to be sarcastic.
“ That handsome divorce has returned from the
torrid North to his old haunts at' Toorak. At
first the Naicest girls fought a little shy of their
former favorite, but they soon forgot their small
fictions about - ‘ feeling so awfully awkward, don’t-
cherknow. ’ The culprit comes of a good-looking
stock, and is closely related to one of the oldest
and staidest Tasmanian elans. A junior relative
of above grass-widower is also pleasing to look
upon, and confesses to- a chequered past. Upon
one occasion, at the height of his frisks, he was
converted by a visiting evangelist, and repented
ostentatiously for quite a long time.
Y ours affectionately,

GOOD HEALTH WITHOUT DRUGS.
4.—Mothers and Children.
Mothers who would keep their children in good
health should give them, morning and evening,
Dr. Tibbies’ Vi-Ctiooa made with hot milk. Deli ■
cate men and women who have weak lungs, to be
hale, robust and healthy, should use Dr. Tibbies’
Vi-Co.Goa morning and evening, and all men who
have to be exposed to the bleak uncertainty of our
trying climate should fortify themselves before
they face their daily toil with Dr. Tibbies’ Vi-
Cocoa, arid, then they can brave the fury of the
elements with equanimity. The writer speaks
from personal experience and from observation of
beneficial effects on others. Tea opens the pores
and temporarily excites, coffee stimulates the
action of the heart, whilst Dr. Tibbies’Vi-Cocoa
gives strength, stamina, and builds up arid
strengthens the lung tissues. It is indeed a
wonderful food beverage. Nothing has ever been
discovered that can approach it-in giving lightness
of heart, joy of life, fleetness of foot, And that
general feeling of comfort which only comes from
a full capacity to ‘enjoy every pleasure, moral,
intellectual and physical.
Dr. Tibbies’Vi-Cocoa can be obtained from all
chemists, grocers, and stores, or from Dr. Tibbies’
Vi-CoGoa, Limited, 269 George-street, Sydney.
Merit, and-merit alone, is what we claim for Dr.
Tibbies’ Vi-Cocoa, and we are prepared to send to

Cocoa.*

SOME SYDNEY AGRICULTURAL SHOW SKETCHES.
Nigger-flogger Brockman (struck off the
Westralian «T.P. list since his conviction) is a scion
of perhaps the oldest of the Six Families. The
founder of the Westralian branch, like the
ancestor of the Hammersley clan, was a cadet of
an Oxfordshire family. In the sister province’s
early days, Brockmans, Hammersleys, and Le-
froys were more or less intermarried.
Byrne, of Melb. Age, whose book on the
fossil “ Australian writers ’’ (he has not heard of
the new men at all) fell flat a couple of years ago,
is returning to London. He was for some years
in the Age s London office, and his soul pants for
more smoke and fog. Syme made him tempting
offers to stay in Melbourne, but, being a bachelor
with means and aspirations, Byrne made up his
mind to go.
Percy Spence seems to have as much work
in. London as he can find time to do. A very good
full-page drawing of his appears in a recent Black
and White. Harper’s Magazine has just re-
ceived delivery of a commission which it
recently entrusted to Spence, and has ordered
more. Besides this, Spence has executed a good
commission in illustrating W. E. Norris’ new
serial story for the Gentlewoman.
Stuart Briggs, recently executed at Dar-
ling-hurst for murder, was at one time in JN.S. W.
police-force; and M‘Coy, now under .sentence of
death at Mudgee for murder, is a police pen-
sioner.
Irony ! “ Lilian Constance ”is the name
of the respondent wife (divorced, with costs
against the co.) in the latest case deemed dirty
enough by the Sydney dailies to be worth ques-
tion-and-answer reports under sensational head-
lines.
Victoria has just lost William Fisher, aged
102, formerly resident of Gunning. In the matter of
descendants, 147 is his little lot. William smoked
tobacco and drank beer, and The Bulletin
ascribes his extraordinary longevity to these
things.
Of Alfred Bennett, late boss of Sydney
E. News, T. P. O’Connor’s paper says that “ the
members of his staff regarded him with the same
awe with which N.Y. Herald chief Bennett in-
spires his people.” Mebbe, but hardly for the
same reason.
“Jeopardy” Eagar, master of N.S.W.
anti-Eederal ceremonies, was 46th of the 49
candidates who went to the N.S.W. Federal-
Delegate poll, scoring less than one six-hundredth
of the votes cast. Even the ghostly “ Bob ” Reid
beat him by 3,467 votes.
The Old Jack Robertson memorial fund,

Nearly 21 years ago Julius Yogel made an
abortive attempt to enter the House of Commons
whde still Agent-General for Maoriland. He
selected the seaport town of Falmouth as a likely

depot for departing immigrants, but without
success.
A Q. Ministerial candidate, with a reputa-
tion for wit, was told by a loud-mouthed Labor

been courteously received everywhere, but this
was the first time he had ever been invited to the

Of Premier Reid’s original batch of ten
nominees to N.S.W. Leg. Council Dan O’Connor
and S. E. Lees resigned to contest Assembly
electorates at the general election. Daniel dis-
appeared at Pyrmont, but Lees regained his seat
at Nepean. Of the remaining eight, John Hughes,
Dr. Cullen, Ed. Pulsford and Alex. Kethel
supported the Federal Enabling Bill; Jago Smith
and “Financier” Backhouse opposed it; and J.
Blanksby and S. H. Hyam were absent.
Rev. Dr. Bruce, travelling organiser of
N.S.W. Presbyterians, longheadedly instils as he
goes a new view on the ever-absorbing stipend
question. He urges house-fathers not to pay
church dues in their own names alone, but to
divide the sum into parts, and get each member
of the family to pay his or her portion. The
children, this philosophical stipend-raiser argues,
will thus acquire a habit of giving which will stick
to them when they earn money of their own.
“Jaeger”: I want to know this, if ever
in the world’s history before a man had the same
opportunity of breaking or making a Federation
as has Want? At the other end of the world he
S 3 the strings that make the Dibbsian figures
against union. Who is Want, anyhow ? One-
half the people in Australia never heard of him
before and yet we await his command. Why the
devil don’t they make him second wicket-keeper
in the Australian XI. so as to keep his mouth
shut? To the Australian XI. Federation is always
secondary. George Giffen could get us Federation
in ten minutes, and yet he was left behind.
“ C.M.G.” : David Syme is credited with
many fine qualities as a boss and as the head
engineer of a “ great daily,” but he certainly lacks
one happy knack—the ability to keep his good
men. He can find them, but he fails to hold
them. This reflection applies to the reporting-
staff. Of the staff David had seven years ago
only one is now left. The Argus succeeds better;
it makes things comfortable for providers of good
stuff, and has always one or two of the best avail-
able when D.S. is chasing round for a young man
who is superior to the bald work of telling about
the fire that broke out or the horse that bolted.
Just when the announcement was made
that Hallam Tennyson had been appointed S.A.
Governor because he happened to be his father’s
son, N.S.W. Govt. Gazette notified that a son of
the famous Charles Dickens had become lessee of
a far way-back Govt, tank, with surrounding
block. But in the latter ease it was, probably,
because Edward Bulwer Lytton Dickens offered
the highest price. Dickens, by the way, seems to
have given up all thought of re-entering politios
(it was the awful Sleath who ousted him from his
Wilcannia seat), and seems content to live out an
ancient jackeroo’s life among the far-western
mulga.
Mr. Forbes Johnston to The Bulletin
from Lower Hutt, Wellington, Maoriland
Two years ago I had a narrow escape from being killed
by a stag (red-deer) near Wairarapa Lake (M.L.), and an
account of the affair, having gone the rounds of the
papers, was ridiculed by Tub Bulletin as an exaggera-
tion, if,not an absolute concoction. When told of this,
I merely said that the brute would perhaps vindicate me
by killing somebody thereafter ; and, as the same stag
has now gored a Maori woman to death, perhaps you
will print this as collateral evidence of my truthfulness.
The red-deer stag, when solitary, is an extremely vicious
and dangerous animal, and lives have frequently been
lost in this way.
An artist in black-and-white rushed the
other morning into the editorial room of an Aus-
tralian city paper and described enthusiastically
his new process for reproducing photos, within the
short space of 20 minutes, of which, he said, he
could at once give an example. “ You’re the
right man in the nick of time. A man has just
murdered his wife and two children down at
street, and we’ll have their pictures along present-
ly.” “ Where did you say ? ” enquired the artist.
“Blank-street,” replied the subeditor. “What
name?” asked the artist. “X -.’’replied the
sub-editor. “ Good God ! that’s my sister !”
“ Steff C.” : Very weary of reading the
usual obituary notices of departed European

medal for Inkerman, and a clasp of something for
Blinkerman, and was present at the storming of
So-on.” Here’s an obit, notice from the Maori-
land papers:
. Iraia Te Rangiwhetuki died at Taiporohenui Pa on
Wednesday. He was considerably over 100 years old and
bad been present at the engagements of Kaitake, Ota-
paoa, Te Ngntu-o-te-Manu, Pokaikai, Papatihakehake,
Okotuku and Taurangaika. He escaped miraculously in
the Ot.apaoa affair, receiving three bullets, all in the neck.
Something like a record !
Q. Inclependent-Opposition leader Drake
displays, in his paper (Progress) a strenuousness
which he might advantageously emulate on the
platform. He thus answers some personal refer-
ences of the local Courier :
We have no intention, however, at present, by adopting
a policy of retaliation, to lower ourselves to the level of
the Courier. Our aim is rather to raise the tone of the
Courier to our own standard. Nor should we wish just
at this period to saddle the editor of the Courier with
the responsibility of the contents of that journal. We
have a considerable amount of respect for that gentle*
man, and' we prefer to think that most of the Courier’s
work during the last three weeks has been performed by
a hireling, engaged on the same terms as Shakespeare’s
“ First and Second Murderers i.e., to do some nasty,
disreputable work for cash payment on the understand-
ing that the agents will be promptly disowned as soon as
the job is done.
“ Saw Count Esterhazy, the triple traitor
of the Dreyfus drama, to-night,” writes The
Bulletin’s London correspondent, “and he looks
it. Might easily be labelled as a better class of
souteneur. Piercing black eyes in dissipated
leaden frames, shapely aquiline nose, heavy black
moustache spraying at the ends, a growing beard,
and a blank bald head in a horseshoe of sparse be-
spattered grey hair. Rounded back, covered by a
tightly-buttoned frock coat, uncertain spindly legs,
thin hips and no chest, are the bodily attributes of
this candidate for the Paris throne. And he says
he’ll get there if Dreyfus is again condem-ned. If
not, he will expose the generals. It is to be
hoped, however, he will on no account expose
himself—mentally’or morally.”

“Clod" : Apropos John Farrell re John
Mitchel. Many Bulletin readers may be inter-
ested to know that when the ship in which
Mitchel escaped from Tasmania put into Sydney
harbor it became known to a small number of
Mitchel’s sympathisers in the city that be was on
board, and they had him brought ashore and
entertained at a convenient place, amongst the
movers in the matter being D. H. Deniehy and
W. B. Dailey. Deniehy (present writer’s infor-
mant) said they spent a glorious night, and pru-
dently did not prolong the festivity too far into
next morning. On breaking up the whole party
escorted their guest to where, at Woolloomooloo,
a boat awaited him. The moment Mitchel was
aboard the ship weighed anchor and departed for
the land of the Stars and Stripes. I asked
Deniehy if he did not think it a rash thing to do,
and he assured me that several officials high in
authority were perfectly cognisant of what was
taking place.
Apropos recent cables announcing Signor
Marconi's wonderful success in wireless tele-
graphy. “ A.W.8.” writes to The Bulletin :
As there’s nothing new under the sun one need not be
surprised at the announcement in a Maoriiand paper that
a local savant had long ago succeeded in telegraphing
without wires. It seems probable, however, that if Vic-
toria had possessed a master mind some years back Signor
Marconi would have been forestalled, and the honor of mak-
ing such an important discovery been Australia’s. Nearly
ten years ago a boat, bearing a “ live ” torpedo, was pro-
ceeding down Port Phillip, and when a considerable dis-
tance off shore it most unaccountably exploded. Several
men were killed and injured, and at the subsequent in-
quest the officials could only explain the accident
by insisting that some one had touched one of the
electric connections or meddled with the battery on shore.
Abundant evidence was forthcoming almost proving the
impossibility of this finding, but the authorities could
come to no other conclusion. The late Cosmo Newbery
hazarded the conjecture that an electric current, carried
by an unknown agency, and transmitted through the air,
had passed from the shore to the torpedo ; but the
authorities, pointing out the distance of the boat, the
turbulent waters between, and other circumstances
“ fatal ”to the idea, laughed it out of court. Abetter
knowledge of the “ wave-length theory,” and the proper-
ties of the ether, a less busy Govt, official, or the presence
of a truly scientific mind, and wireless telegraphy would
have perhaps been a common thing enough to-day. Not
by any means an isolated case of a tremendous scientific
fact trembling in the balance of discovery.

After all is said and done, Sam. M‘Caughey is probably
rieher than was Tyson. He was born at Ballymena, Ire-
land, about 60 years ago. He owns Toorale, Dunlop,
Goonong (his residence), Goolgumbla, Byalla, Singorimba,
and North Yanko, and is partner in Yarrabree with his
brother John. Has also a lot of money in Riverina pro-
perties nominally held by others. His Queensland runs
are Rookwood and Barenya in Hughenden district. His
first run was Singorimba, 50 miles from Jerilderie ; then,
about ’6l, he purchased Coonong. In ’BO he bought
Toorale and Dunlop from Salmon Wilson for £400,000,
and has made most of his money out of those two places.
Toorale has been famous for its horses—hundreds of
beauties have gone to India during the last 15 years.
Toorale shore 400,000 sheep in one year in the 80’s, and in
one of those years they sold 18,000 young ewes at
18s. per head, and 30,000 wethers at 14s. The
value of the Sam M'Caughey freeholds in New South
Wales is little short of £2,000,000, the areas amount-
ing to 545,000 acres. Mr. M’Caughey shore last year
1,300,000 sheep. He owns some 2000 horses and about
6000 head of cattle. Has also a big share in Coree, his
late brother David’s property. In ’B5 he went to America
and spent £40,000 in Vermont merinos, out of which he
has made another fortune. He leads a very active life.
Is his own general manager, and knows all that is going
on on all his properties far and near. Is always making
improvements. Pays his men well, and expects good
work in return. Is at breakfast by 6.30 every morning,
and midnight often finds him still toiling at his vaist cor-
respondence. Is a real good sort; popular alike with
men who meet him for the first time and those who have
known and dealt with him for years ; plays an excellent
game of billiards, likes a good dinner, and enjoys life in
a quiet way. Has a great penchant for machinery, and
has invented very useful contrivances for tank-sinking
and water-lifting. Made £3OOO in royalties out of one of
his earth-scoops.

The M‘Gooey breaks out in a fresh place :
Grabben Gullen is dose to Burrowa, which explains all
about it in a single sentence. Its population consists of
Ryan and Dwyer, with an odd Rooney and Mulcahy
thrown in. Thirty years ago, when the Grabben Gullen
man —the original and genuine artiole —wasn’t bashing
his “ old woman ” with a wooden shovel, or running about
with nothing on but his boots and trousers yelling out
for someone to come and “ pick him up ” while he fought
his nearest neighbor, he was training a billy-goat to fight.
The Grabben Gullen man who in those days didn’t own
at least one billy-goat, was regarded with suspicion. And
the bigger his goat, the more respect the Grabben Gullen-
ite received. The mere swapping of goats established a
species of clanship which it took lots of backsliding,
thieving, and general misconduct to dissever. Every
Sunday a battle royal took place between every man’s
goat and his neighbor’s, the stakes being a bucketful of
potatoes. Sometimes a quart of whisky (home-made),
and even a sucking-pig, changed hands on the event.
Sometimes, also, the men themselves started fighting,
and a Grabben Gullen fight was a sight for the gods and a
job for the Goulburn doctors. The G.G. man always
fought best and most effectively while up in the air (on
the wing, so to speak). He was eminently dangerous in the
rear, for when he bounded 6ft. into the air, cracking his
ironshod heels 120 times to the minute, he pummelled
the man in fr'ont with fists and head, and, kicking out
backwards with both feet at once, contrived to cave-in
the faces of those behind him. . . . The following Grab-
bengullenalities are immortal, viz. : A Grabben Gullen
“bullock” is a native bear, a G.G. “cheque” is a pig.
When the stranger had finished reaping he got his choice
either to carry away his “ cheque” by the tail, and get it
cashed at the nearest pub., or go away empty-handed. . ..
A G. Gullen “pie” is a pumpkin stuffed with potatoes.
The man who ate meat on Fridays was known as a “ yaller-
belly.” A traveller who once ate meat, on Good Friday
was followed 16 miles by 27 Dwyers, 18 Ryans, 4 Rooneys,
and 2 Gallaghers, under the belief that he would “ doy
(die) at shundown ” —but he didn’t. When a G. Gullen
man means “ yes” he says “ yaf,” the old women “ yef,”
and the young women “ yif ” ; the young men say “ yaaf.”
They rang no bells at. G. Gullen at dinner-time, but a
young woman wearing- a native-bearskin skirt, trimmed
with dogchains, and her father’s old black-cloth waistcoat,
came within three chains of the reapers or potato-rooters
and snorted out, “ Kum along; they’re boilt,” meaning
the spuds.

“ s.” : No worse insult can possibly
be offered to a way-back aboriginal than to
say that he has a weak or thin skull. To the
white, “ thickheaded ” is an insult; to the black-
man it is a great compliment. To say “you got
em head no thicker than an egg-shell,” will bring
about a fight any day of the week—a prompt dar-
ing of the scandaliser to make good his words.

The M‘Cooey : The Bulletin is correct
(21/l/’99) about lizards running on hind-legs,
Many Australian lizards run, when frightened,
entirely on the hind-legs, with tail quite off the
ground, and body inclined forward at angle of
about 55. “ Leseur’s water lizard,” common on
the Wollondilly and Tweed Rivers, has this habit,
and to see it “ scooting ” for the river, across the

sand, is about as ludicrous a sight as one could
imagine. A small Varanus, found always in
waterless, plain country, runs also most comically
upon its hind-legs, as do several other species.
Owing to the angle that the feet of large Austra-
lian lizards have with the axis of the body their
run upon all-fours is extremely clumsy.

“Tin-Lip” on a toxicological subject :
Dear Bulletin. — Re oil cure of strychnine-poisoned
dog (8., 18/2/99) it was this way. Sheep-do”-hud swal-
lowed bait, and had one convulsion. I ran to station,
got first oil procurable (cod-liver) and jammed a tumbler-
ful down dog’s throat. Result, dog alive to-day. Have
heard of same cure repeatedly from old-time shepherds.
Another remedy which I have seen used effectively is to
powder some charcoal and likewise jam it down dog’s
throat as best you can, using water if necessary. Another :
Moment you see dog eating bait catclrhim by hind legs
and swing him round and round—result, bait vomited
up. As The Bulletin wished to break George Pile’s dog
up recently, give it strychnine. I’ll supply the oil and a
£5-note if it fails to cure him. Any oil, I believe, will do.
I plank down 2s. 6d. to purchase oil meanwhile, and if
you or George Pile’s dog aren’t taking any, contribute
said amount to appeal made in Bulletin on behalf of the
Afghan camel-drivers against the Bourke Carrying Co.
Will bet any Bulletin reader £5 re the oil-cure, and let
you, if you will, hold the stakes. — Tin-Lip.
If “ Tin-Lip’s ” theory is sound, what is its
rationale ?

‘ ‘ Old-Time ” on certain native foods :
The N. Australian native tribes in and around Port
Essington use very largely for food the root of a species
of bull-rush, not unlike the combunga, so common on
the Murray flats around Swan Hill, where also it was
largely eaten. The Port Essington natives, grow fat
during the time this root is in season. They call it
marro-ait. It is eaten as a paste, after being bruised
between two stones, and then browned over red-hot
coals. I found it sweet and pleasant to eat. It favors
the small, shallow lagoons and big plains with shallow
water-courses thereon. The roots of the water-lily (Nym-
phia) are also much used, and are excellent eating.
The aborigines eat largely also of various kinds of yams.
There grows in rich profusion on the northern peninsula,
a really excellent vegetable, the “cabbage palm,” the
edible part growing near the top, sometimes 60ft. from
the ground, and forming the heart of the plume-like
bunch of leaves on the crest of the tall trunk. The
cabbage is bulky and palatable. It is obtained by tearing
away the surrounding leaves until the heart is reached.
A want of knowledge of these edible plants has cost
many valuable lives and much hardship. No better
instance need be given than that mentioned by Capt.
Simpson as having occurred when he was looking
for the papers of the unfortunate explorer Kennedy
and the missing members of his expedition. When
the Captain reached Shelburne Bay (at which
place eight men had been left behind, and where six of
them had died from sheer starvation) he was, he says,
“surprised to find some cabbage-palms growing in the
vicinity of the camp, the tops of which are very nutri-
tious and would be most desirable to starving men had
they been aware of it.” The pith of this palm, as well as
the fibre of the bottle-tree, is now well-known to be rich
in farina. There is also a very agreeable native goose-
berry, almost identical with the Cape variety, it is
sometimes found only as a bush, but in certain localities
it reaches to the dimensions of a tree. In either case the
fruit is equally good, and quite worthy of cultivation as
a domesticated fruit.

“Long-’Un ” : In the 90-Mile Desert is a
little oasis—Hawks’ Nest—-through which the
gold-escort passed in the old Bendigo days.
Track since abandoned, but this solitary gum-and-
sheoak-covered basin was once the abode of man,
evidenced by a fallen-in well and the remains of
an old letter-box (half a kerosene-tin fastened to
a tree with fencing-wire). Camped alongside, and
in the morning, rolling up bluey, killed a couple
of centipedes under pillow. Biil kicked his feet
out of his rugs, and out wriggled a beauty. The
other Bill got up and started fossicking. One
under his ear on pillow ; shook another out of his
swag-bag. After breakfast, went to tucker-box
for lunches. The cook had sent out a large tart,
and, stuck in the centre of the jammy part—more
centipede! Went to same box in evening for
a candle, and found yet another coiled around the
inside of the packet. Following days, scores more
killed. Only place for miles untouched by bush-
fires ; hence the centipedes.

“ Trotter B.” : I have never seen a Maori
woman suckling a pig, but I have seen one
suckling a puppy. When I was staying at the
Maori settlement of Hikutaia, Upper Thames,
the chief (a man about 50) had a wife of about 18.
She had no children, but she used to have a puppy
constantly pulling away, first at one breast and
then at the other. What amount of sustenance
the puppy derived from the process I am unable
to say. The chief had also a sister of about 40
living with him. I could not then speak Maori
and I quite misunderstood the situation, taking
the chief’s sister for his wife and making love to
his wife under the impression that she was his
daughter. The old fellow made numerous
attempts to set me right, but failed utterly. One
day he and his sister went pigeon-shooting, and as
they thought it was not good enough to leave me
behind they took me with them, but as soon as
we got in the bush, I gave them the slip and set
off hot foot for the settlement. But fast as I was
the chief was there before me. Three times more
I played him the same trick, with the same
result, so I gave it best. Not long after a
white man came from Shortland with a load
of provisions, and lectured me on the enor-
mity of my offence in making love to the wife
of a chief. I said, “I thought all the time she
was his daughter.” “ No,” said the pakeha, “ she
is his wife.” “But who is the other one?” I
queried. “That is my wife,” replied the pakeha.
I thought after that it was time to leave, so
bundled up my traps and cleared for Ohinemuri.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
M'Grogan ran a business in the town of Droughty Scrub,
Where he made a decent living from the profits of a pub.;
Though the products of the district were primitive and
few,
And the people lived by catching wild dog and kangaroo ;
But the price of skins fell heavily, and things were rather
bad,
And even leading citizens were feeling somewhat sad.
Then it happened that a barber man, who cut the local
hair,
And cut it very badly—when he wasn’t on the tear,
Just mentioned to the grocer, when he made a passing
call,
How the townsmen ought to agitate to get the Capital;
And the grocer thought the barber quite a genius in his
way,
And consulted on the matter with the butcher ’cross the
way.
The butcher thought it splendid, as the climate there
was right—
Always very clear in daylight, and fairly dark at night;
And the editor—a writer by some considered tame —
Brought out a powerful article to bear upon the same,
Showing how the country round them, if only rung and
scrubbed,
And the mountains slightly levelled, and the rocks all
burnt and grubbed,
Would be suitable for settlement; no country far or near
Was nearly equal to it, said the Dingo Pioneer.
So the matter was decided by the people one and all
That Droughty Scrub was suitable to be the capital.
M’Grogan knew the distance from the city very well—
He had tramped it in the ’Bo’s, when he kept the Gum
Hotel,
And the member for the district has sent them word to
say
He is almost sure to get it, if he can but have his way.
So they held a monster meeting, and the Mayor spoke
loud in praise
Of the good times in the future, of the coming better
days,
When no longer they will live upon the ’possum, bear,
and grub,
And a gorgeous marble capital will rise at Droughty
Scrub.

“ WITH THE FLIES.”
A bushman thinks the meanest man— on earth, at all
events—
Is he who has a liquor “ with the flies ; ”
They’ll forgive a man who robs them, but not a man
consents
To look at him who boozes “ with the flies.”
He may not know a single soul of those who fill the bar ;
He may be but a stranger who has travelled from afar ;
But let him liquor solus, and the lads say, “ There you
are 1
He’s a crook 'un, for he’s drinkin’ with the flies.”

“ Alleera ” : He iguana swallowing shin-
bone of calf. Was once working in the bush,
and, at mid-day, threw away a ham-bone picked
clean. Shortly afterwards heard tapping, and
found that an iguana was trying to swallow
the bone. One end projected inches from his
mouth, but, as the other was apparently too large
for his throat, he was assisting its progress
mechanically by backing a few inches from a log
and then rushing up and striking the end of the
bone against it. Kept on till the outer end of the
bone was flush with his mouth.
“ Yes,” said Old Barney,
“ bullick s was bullicks them times.
I remember one wet day goin’ up
the Big Range looken fur a tree
fur shingles. I was wallten’ along the
top of the Range when I turns round
and sees a big red bullick stalken’
me. I makes down the mountain-
side, and he after me as hard as he
could lick. I sees a big holler log,
and runs for it, and just as I crawls
inter it down he comes ‘ Whooh ! ’
and takes the sole of me boot with
his near horn. I crawls up the log
fur about fifteen foot, and I hears
him walken’ round and sniffen. I
gets me eyes to a crack and looks out,
and sees him looken’ in at me
through the same crack, that close
that if I could ’a got me knife I could
’a jabbed his eye out; but the log
was too tight. I was wonderin’ what
he meant to do next, when I hears
him hooken’ his horn under the log,
and away me and it goes rollen’ down
the side of the mountain and the
bullick after us. It was steep, and
we (me and the log) must ’a rolled
three miles in a little more ’n three
minutes—the bullick racin’ close be-
hind—when bump we goes ag’in a
big stringy-bark ; the log breaks in
two the middle, and one half
goes down one spur, and the other
half, with me in it, down another;
and the last I sees of that bullick
he was chasin’ the wrong half.
Presently my half stops at the foot
of the range, and I crawls out.
Didn’t look any more for good-
splitten’ timber that day.”

“ Roley P.” : “Recently saw
porcupine in orchard lie down under
apple tree, erect his spines, and roll
over the apples which had fallen
from the tree. When he arose he
had a fair cargo, and made for a
hollow log, into which he backed
himself, the apples dropping off as he squeezed
in. He then ate them at his leisure.” Looks
like a tozer.

At Clermont (N.Q.) the town, band, which
is only in its infancy, for three days previous to
the decease of a popular publican, whose dying
wish it was that the Dead March in “ Saul ” should
be played at his funeral, industriously practised
and labored heavily under the strains of the Dead
March aforesaid. How consoling for that publican
in his last hours !

“H.S.”: I once dug up an aboriginal
grave on the shores of Lake Menindie, N.S.W.,
to obtain the skeleton. I found the remains en-
cased in gum-leaves, which, though the burial
had taken place over 20 years before, still retained
a shade of green. The body was about Gft. below
the surface, rolled in soft and Pj iant .) >ar ttn(
bound with thongs of same. Ihe tribes there-
abouts on burying their dead go down in pairs
into the grave, and wound each other severely on
the head with nullas and waddies until the blood
flows freely on to the corpse. This at tunes is
kept up by relays of warriors anxious to take part
in the proceedings. Green boughs are then
usually placed over the body, which mostly lies in
a bed or nest of gum-leaves. Ihe females near
relatives of deceased, used to cut off their hair,
place a net on the head, then plaster their heads
all over with gypsum, often to 2in. in thickness.
One of these “widow’s caps” in my possession
weighs nearly 101 b. They were worn continuously
from a week to a fortnight, then deposited on the
grave along with some peculiar-shaped balls, from
size and form of an emu’s egg downwards, made
of gypsum, sand and pipeclay. Occasional speci-
mens are still to be found on parts of the Darling.
Related of an English swell that he was
travelling alone by rail with a lovely female
stranger, when, after scant preliminaries, she tore
her toque from her head, dishevelled her hair,
and, as the train pulled up, shrieked for help,
declaring that she had been brutally assaulted.
But her fellow-passenger stirred not—he lay
quietly back, smoking his cigar. “What,” ex-
claimed the station-master, “ have you to say to
this charge?” “Only this!” was the answer,
and the cool hand pointed to his cigar, which
showed a beautiful grey ash over an inch long.
The good old railway-boom days in Vic-
toria are over with a vengeance. The long-talked-
of Mildura railway is at last being surveyed.
Proposed terms of construction: Line to be un-
fenced ; laid with second-hand rails; any private
land required for the line to be handed over free
of charge ; the Mildura residents to send all their
produce bound for Melbourne by rail instead of
water carriage for three years ; a yearly rate of Is.
in the £ on the rental value of Mildura lands to
be levied if necessary to make the line pay 3| per
cent, on cost; proceeds of Govt, land sales for 15
miles on each side of the line to go towards paying
off cost of construction; also, for 20 years, all State
land rentals in same area, over and above rentals
now received, to be similarly applied. And only
10 years ago anybody who wanted a railway just
asked Dunky Gillies for it, and Dunky simply
rang the bell and told his menial to bring up two
or three railways at once.
One Syngros, a defunct Greek capitalist,
has got his name cabled all over the earth because
he bequeathed £1,000,000 to the sorely impover-
ished Greek Govt. Here is a hint for the rich
Miss ETHEL TURNER (Mrs. Curlewis) and her daughter.
Alia photo., Sydney.
Australian who is struggling for a title. The man
who wants to make a big sensation and get a title
of unusual dimensions must strike something new.
The church and university donation and all the
other beaten tracks are played out. But the man
who presented the country with a much-needed
new railway, or 100 miles of good road, or gave
some little city a water-supply or paid off its debt;
or who gave the country ,£500,000 as the nucleus
of a sinking fund to reduce the public debt, would
be heard of all over the earth, and would pro-
bably be made a duke.
In this issue appears a picture of Ethel
Turner (Mrs. Curlewis) with the Eighth Little
Australian (a daughter) which she has added, in
fact, to her famous “Seven” in fiction' It will
be satisfactory to Mrs. Curlewis’ numerous readers
to know that domestic joys have not so far been
allowed to interfere with her literary work.
The Vienna Fbjemdenblatt has the oldest
of living journalists actively engaged upon its
staff. Herr Leopold von Blumencron, the curiosity
in question, celebrated his 95th birthday lay walk-
ing down to the office as usual and reeling off a
little “copy” for the evening and next morning
editions of the paper. Younger members of the
staff took the opportunity to decorate his desk
with flowers, which was, perhaps, not a very
cheering compliment under the circs. For a
Blumencron, born on 21st Feb., 1804, floral
tributes must surely come as a reminder that all
flesh is grass.

J.K.: Jokes about rumbling in the innards only
wanted occasionally—say once per century F.C. : You
want to call the Federal city “ Oorrobboree,” do you ?
C- A - : Where’s your sense of satire? Every com-
pany promoter has the “ fullest confidence ” that 'he will
succeed .... Rialto: The case being sub-judice we can’t
comment on it like that. The probable end of the affair
will be that, civil proceedings, however abortive, having
formerly been taken, the Crown lawyers will simply put
their tongues in their cheeks and express their regret that
the victims didn’t adopt the right means of nabbing
their man A.W. : Can’t tell you how many crimes are
punishable by death in N.S.W.—haven’t had time to
count. Will presently take a long holiday and add 'em
all up. In Great Britain only two crimes are capital.
.....F. : How do you propose that we should get at the
real truth ”of that turf-success ? By making libellous
insinuations which would be probably quite untrue, and
which could not possibly be legally proved ? In matters
of chance the most astounding things happen. For a
start, how many tickets did Stoddart hold? Meoro :
Gov. Phillip didn’t make any eloquent speech to the first
colonists assembled at Dawes Point. From all that can
be gathered of Phillip he was a phlegmatic Deutscher by
no means addicted to wagging his jaw. The “ eloquent
speech ” alluded to by Spruson, M.L.A., was composed
for Phillip many a long year after his death by one
Flanagan, who wrote an alleged history of' N.S.
Wales, and, after the manner of his kind, pictured
Phillip as a kind of early-day Dan O’Connor
A.S.W. (Glebe) : That Tyson yarn has been going round
for 25 years, and it was a lie all the time
Coota : “ What is the proper place for woman in

the New 7 Guinea Govt, officials trade on their own, &c.
But how do you know enough to make so sweeping a
negative ? Tynne Tacke : The Athen/eum notice of
Kendall is reproduced in Sladen’s collection of “ Aus-
tralian Ballads.” H.S.R. : The gist of it is that Car-
narvon (Q.*) electors voted Foxton in because long habit
of crawling has destroyed their understandings .... Why-
Not : Too moral. We believe in morals, but not morals
in verses Magnus : The dailies should have printed an
abstract of the whole correspondence in the divorce-case
Cligny v. Hull. Then the idiocy of the jury would have
been transparent. The case was a really attractive one,
and contained much picturesque “copy”; that a lot
more wasn’t made of it is an indictment of Sydney news-
paper acumen A.C. : “The Billiard-Marker’s" yarn
will shortly be reprinted in one of Thf, Bulletin’s verse-
collections .... Mopsa : Nearly everybody who seriously
intends earning money by literary contributions should
buy a typewriter, and make his wares attractive.

D. N. Jonson : Verse no good. Oliver Bainbridge is a
N.S. Welshman, and, so far as The Bulletin knows, has
never been out of Australia Narine : The gentleman’s

more story in it. A good, unexciting little
study; but if we often published nice little maun-
derings we’d be constantly bombarded with nice
little maunderings. A newspaper gets what it gives
M.B. : “ Nan ” is an unreal dream of a woman with long,
howding wildernesses of brown hair A.M.L. : Easy
enough to say “ Borrow and repudiate.” But, if we owe
enough, probably a British fleet and army wou dcall round
arid demand that the railways and public lands be handed
over in satisfaction of the debt, and the customs revenue
“ hypothecated.” When your creditor is ten times bigger
than you, you can’t always repudiate I.F.D. : “Girl
of the Sunlight” is a literary misfit Grange: The
“main point” is not so much to hang the murderer of
the Murphys as to discover and convict him. You see,
every intending secret-murderer thinks himself so much
cleverer than all the murderers who have gone before ;
and it will do enormous harm to let such people remain
under the belief that it is easy to commit murder and not
be found out John Drake : (1) Not taking any
“Chamberlain” or “ Wattleala ” for Federal capital.
(2) Why invent such elaborate and uncertain devices
for shutting down on blackmail when it can be
utterly extinguished by drawing all sweeps on day
of race? The horse owner can’t demand share of prize
before he will start his horse if neither he nor
anybody else knows till about moment of race who
has drawn the animal. That is absolutely certain

Where the stranger ceases nodding,
To all passers up and down,
That’s the limit of the countrj',

IMPRESSIONS OF BENDIGO’S EASTER FAIR.


THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems.*

Concerning some of the new Q. Labor-
members : —
Among the new batch of Q. Labor-men Worker Higgs
stands easily first in general interest. A Sydney native,
and about 6ft. 3in. in his socks, he has some of the limp-
ness usually associated either with the Cornstalk or the
long-drawn-out man. He has ferocious energy, masked
by a deceitful deliberativeness in speaking, both in public
and private, which is decidedly effective. He is a fanati-
cal “straight-goer,” but is a man of affairs withal, and
knows his book. His besetting weakness is amiability—
he lacks gall to make opposition bitter. “ Joe ” Lesina is
another ex-Sydneyice. Used to be a flash-light at public
meetings in the old Single-tax days. Was, and still is,
probably the most fluent and rapid speaker in the
Southern Hemisphere—could even out-point, in these re-
spects, Holman, of N.S.W. Labor-party. Went North,
developed Socialistic and unionistic views, became editor
of Charters Towers Eagle, and settled down into resneo-
tability, matrimony, and M.L.A.-ship. Enjoys talking
for its own sake, and will be a thorn in the side of Q.
Government Hansard. Givens ran for Cairns last time.
Was then a Freetrade crank. A hard grafter, personally
irreproachable, and, barring hisfiscalomania, level-headed
enough. Fisher, of Gympie, is a stolid and immovable
Scotsman, stirred to a slow fire of consuming indignation
by the financial iniquities of the Q.N. Bank. Formerly
member for Gympie ; defeated last time, he owes his re-
habilitation mainly to the steady work of that smart
paper Gympie Truth, of which he is part-owner. He
knows the art of saying nothing for good long spells, and
often uses his knowledge.
THE WHISKY OE THE WISE
is the title bestowed on D.C.L. Scotch (black
bottle) by many hotel-keepers. They remark that
the more brainy customers, veterans who think
twice before ordering, say—“Mine is “D.C.L.”*
Significant that Barr-Smith, S.A. depart-

Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure in adding my
testimony to the value of “ Mr. WEBBER’S ”
well-known “HERBAL REMEDY, VITA-
DATIO.”
It has cured me of an obstinate ease of
“GOUT-ECZEMA” in the upper lip, which,
in spite of the best medical advice, afflicted me
for over two years.
My health was also bad, owing to SUP-
PRESSED GOUT, and all the treatment which
I had hitherto been under only aggravated the
disorder.
At last I was induced to give your remedy a
trial, which I did, with the happy result of a
permanent cure, and, at the same time, greatly
improving my health.
I hope this testimony will induce anyone suf-
fering as I did to give the VITADATIO a
FAIR TRIAL, and the result will be, as in my
case, a permanent cure.
You are at liberty to refer anyone to me for
further information in reference to my case.—l
am, dear Sir, yours very sincerely,
J. JOSEPH.

SUFFERERS WILL BE INTERESTED.
Glengower, near Clunes, Victoria,
22nd March, 1899.
Mr. S. A. Palmer, General Agent for
Vitadatio.
Dear Sir, —I must write to tell you of my re-
covery from serious bladder - trouble. About
seven years ago I was seized with it, passing
blood and gravelly matter, and in intense
pain ; it was excruciating and prolonged, and
ultimately incapacitated me entirely, so that
I had to take to my bed and give up work.
The doctors told me I could not be cured, ex-
cept by a painful and dangerous operation,
and I was advised by them to go to Melbourne
and have it done. Bad as the pain was, I pre-
ferred to die from the disease rather than
from the operation, and I got very much
worse. All the medical men could do was to
inject morphia to ease the great pain. Every-
body knows in this district of my condition,
and I was expected to die soon, but Vitadatio
came to my rescue. I was a mere skeleton. A
friend called my attention to a paragraph in the
Southern Cross newspaper about Vitadatio,
and he pressed me so to try it that at last I did.
I took about seven bottles; the first two made
me feel very queer, but I persevered, and got so
well as to get about, ride on horseback, and re-
sume my work. I have never looked back since,
and it is the grandest medicine in the world for
those suffering as I did. I have taken several
bottles since to get thoroughly strong, and I
have no hesitation in giving you permission to
use this letter in the press, and in any other way
you like, so long as others get to know of this
wonderful, life-giving, operation-saving Vita-
datio.
I am now strong and hearty, with a ruddy
complexion, and always actively at hard work,
after many years of suffering, and I have no-
body to thank but God Himself and the friend
who told me of it, and those who make it and
sell it.—Yours gratefully and truly,
JOHN WEATHERSON,
Farmer, Glengower.
Witness—John Young.
A VOICE OF CHEER FROM THE PAR-
SONAGE.
A VERY GRATIFYING TESTIMONY.
WILL GREATLY COMFORT OTHERS.
DISCIPLES OF THE “GOLDEN RULE.”
The Parsonage,
Clunes, 23rd March, 1899.
To Mr. S. A. Palmer,
45-47 Bourke-street,
Agent-General for Vitadatio.
Dear Sir, —It gives me pleasure to state to
you, for the benefit of others who may be suf-
fering and who may read this letter, that I
have been completely cured of what the doc-
tors called “ Chronic Lumbago,” by the use of
Vitadatio, after nine years of great suffering.
Four months ago Mr. Weatherson, a well-to-do
farmer, of Glengower, near Clunes, induced me
to try it. He has been, in my opinion, almost
miraculously cured of a long-standing and
painful disease, through Vitadatio alone, when
all other remedies had failed. He is an attend-
ant at my church, and I know him well.
During my illness I was for several weeks at a
time unable to rest through terrible pains in my
back. Several doctors (whose names I can give
if necessary) attended me, but could give me no
relief. Being a minister of religion, my duties
took me long journeys into the adjacent coun-
try, and you can understand how the dreadful
pain often seriously interfered with my minis-
try. On my journey I have frequently had to
alight from my buggy (quite unable to sit up-
right), and endeavor to get ease by holding on
to the buggy behind. In my extremity, the
doctors advised that the only likely remedy left
to me was an expensive, nay, ruinous, journey
to New Zealand to undergo the sulphur-springs
treatment, and, no matter what the cost, I re-
solved to go. Providence interposed, however,
for friend Weatherson’s case came prominently
before me when I removed from my ministry at
Camperdown to Clunes, and I can truthfully
say that I was saved from the terrible expense of
such a journey, and my health restored, after
many years’ suffering, by Vitadatio.
It is all the more remarkable because I took
about four bottles only. I cannot speak too
highly of the medicine. It is curing several
friends of mine to whom I have recommended it.
I will willingly answer any inquiries that may
be addressed to me about my case, and others
that are within my knowledge, and you may
make whatever use (in the newspapers or other-
wise) you may choose of this letter, for the sake
of those who need freedom from pain. It has
made life a pleasure to me once more, and is
enabling me to carry on God’t work with all the
vigorous health of mind and body He originally
endowed me with.—Yours faithfully,
J. CHENALL,
Bible Christian Minister, Clunes.

THEN IT WENT ON ALL RIGHT.
The writer of the letter which I am going to
copy for you in a moment has a complaint to
make. Rather, perhaps, a complaint to place on
record, as the reason for it is passed away for the
present, and she hopes—and we hope with her —
that it may not return. The complaint does not
refer to any relative, friend, or foe, but to her own
heart. It did not work well. It was weak, and
for a long time she was unable to find means to
make it do better. Which was a serious matter,
inasmuch as the vigor of the circulation of the
blood always depends upon the force wherewith
the heart drives it.
Still, it seems to me we ought to be a bit indul-
gent towards the heart in view of the labor it has
to p‘rform. Remember that it never takes a full
minute’s rest at one time, night or day, from the
instant it begins at your birth until, like a muffled
drum, it stops for good* and all —life’s funeral
march to the grave being over. During all this
while, ten years or a hundred, the heart has got to
keep on pumping blood through your body at the
rate of from 130 strokes a minute in childhood to
50 or GO in old age. If you happen to have a
mechanical turn of mind, it may interest you to
figure out how much this stands for in units of
horse-power for a given case and time. If .not,
you can take my word for it that, merely as a
machine, the heart deserves your respect. So long
as it goes ahead steadily, up hill and down dale,
haminering away softly but strongly, you haven’t
a word to say for or against it; but when it begins
to get weak, maybe skipping a stitch now and
then, you call in the doctor, who puts the tip of
his finger just below the base of your left thumb,
looks wise and solemn (as befits the occasion), and
says, “ Ah, yes, yes ; I see, I see.” But what does
he see ? He doesn’t tell you that; he leaves medi-
cine, and mentions when he will look in again.
But as to the letter I spoke of. “ For many
years,” the lady says, “ I suffered from indigestion
and weak heart. Very little exertion made me
feel weary and tired. Cold, clammy sweats broke
over me. I had a poor appetite, and after meals
an aching pain at the chest and a miserable sink-
ing feeling at the stomach. I had also much pain
at the left side, and my heart would flutter so as
to frighten me. At length I became so weak I
was barely able to get about, being no longer able
to do my housework.
“ Owing to the trouble at my heart I obtained
no proper rest at night, and often walked about
my bedroom at night. Many times these attacks
were so bad I thought I was dying. During the
day a sense of suffocation sometimes came upon
me, and I was obliged to go to the door for fresh
air.
“ Year after year I suffered like this ; now a
little better, now as bad as I could be. In No-
vember, 1887, while on a visit to Croydon, my son-
in-law persuaded me to try Mother Seigel’s Syrup.
He got me a bottle, and after taking it I experi-
enced great relief. The pain at my heart was
easier, and I felt better as a whole. I could eat
well, and the food agreed with me.
“ I now felt encouraged to continue using this
remedy. Soon I was in better health than for
years, the heart trouble having disappeared alto-
gether. Since that time when I feel anything
ailing me a few doses of Mother Seigel’s Syrup
never fail to give the desired relief. I have told
many persons of the benefit I have derived from
it, and hereby consent to your publishing this
statement should you wish to do so.”—(Signed)
(Mrs.) William Harrington, near Wickford Hill,
Clare, Suffolk, November 12, 1897.
Now what ailed Mrs. Harrington’s heart ? Why,
precisely the same things that ailed her lungs, her
nerves and her muscles— weakness. Therein she
is right. It was a weak heart, but not a diseased
heart. The heart is a muscle, and (seeing the pro-
digious lot of work it has to do) necessarily a
strong, active muscle. But it will not work with-
out pay any more than you or I will. With all the
rest of the body, it has got to be sustained and
strengthened by food. Here we have the point,
then. The lady was afflicted with chronic indiges-
tion. For this reason her whole body grew weak
—the heart, of course, with other parts of the
engine. Hence all the symptoms she names. Her
immense all-round weakness and puller-down is
that same old dyspepsia. When Mother Seigel’s.
Syrup made the digestion of plenty of food pos-
sible, the heart went on all right, like a newly-
wound clock.’'

They all take to it, and the more they drink
the better results, as witness our visiting sports-
horse-owners, and bowlers ; the latter simply be-
came enthusiastic in their praise of Zetz Spa Water,
and maintain had they but another week on “Zetz”
the scores would have been different at the finish of
the game. However, this they are determined on,
wherever they go, the cry is “Give me ‘Zetz.’”
Why? Because “It’s orlright.” Let ’em all come,
Zetz spring is running stronger than ever, and
quality undeniable. “Zetz,” the federal governor.*
A bad young man named Hancock, at
Beaufort (Vic.), lately incurred the wrath of a
policeman because he “maintained a sullen
silence ” when reproved by that officer for “ riot-
ous conduct.” Riotous conduct consisted of
smoking in the face and presence of authority as
represented by senior-constable Somebody, and—
with others—passing “ right in front of me, in
defiance of my order to go home ! ” Beaufort
beaks thought this such shameful conduct that
they fined the sullen Hancock 5s. and 25s. costs.
The sullen one didn’t see it. Appealed, and the
beaks were at once humiliated. Decision quashed,
with £15 15s. costs. And now there is one senior-
constable and four Beaufort J’s.P. who have to
take their gruel in “sullen silence.”

Tact.
Tact is born with some men and women, and
those who have it use their gift instinctively. It
is not measured alike to those who have it. Men
possess it in different degrees ; while others, again,
are wanting in it altogether. It is the outcome of
intellectual and temperamental qualifications, and
implies possession of clear perceptions, quick
imagination, and delicate sensibilities. It is
these that give a tactful person his subtle intui-
tion of another’s mental processes and modes of
feeling, and it was tact and sound reasoning that
actuated Mr. J, Stewart, 407 Collins-street, Mel-
bourne, Manager of the Campbell’s Creek Dredg-
ing Co., Castlemaine, in laying aside prejudice
and adopting the use of Warner’s Safe Cure when
suffering from liver complaint. He had the tact
to give credence to hi's friends’ experience. Now
he writes : “I have used Warner’s Safe Cure for
some time for my liver, and find it superior to
anything that could be obtained. lam fully con-
vinced it is a splendid medicine for the above
complaint, and I feel justified in recommending it
to all liver subjects.”*

POLITICAL
POINTS
The Dibbs push was well-advised in calling
its ragged regiment the Colonists’ Anti-Convention
Bill League of N.S.W. The Australians are on
the other side.
The recent accident at Auburn (N.S.W.)
meat-works was the third fatal blow-up in N.S.W.
this year, also it resulted in the third verdict of
accidental death. And still that Land Boilers In-
spection Act shows no sign of coming !
Premier Forrest steps into ex-Premier
Nelson’s shoes in the matter of Federation. Nel-
son favored Federation, of course—so long as it
consisted of mere talk, but show it in concrete
form, and—“ What’s the hurry?” Lip-worship
only.
The politician who resigned his seat to let
Barton into N.S.W. Assembly (Francis Clarke) is
made M.L.C., and the politician who assured the
world he scared Barton from Bourke (E. D.
Millen) is also made M.L.C. Yes —No. Bane
and Antidote.
Yic. appointed Agent - General Andrew
Clarke to his present billet for three years, with a
written proviso that if Federation be accomplished
earlier he will resign without allowance in lieu of
salary. That salutary provision should be at-
tached to all appointments likely to be affected by
Federation by every province which really treats
the Commonwealth as an approaching reality.
Premier Reid's an-
nouncement that he is
in favor of a State
Land Bank and has
been in favor of it
for a long time,
but has never
started one,
and isn’t go-
ing to start
one—he is
only going
to fix up a
little tem-
porary in-
stalment of
one to ease
the tempo-
rary dis-
tress in the
West —isall
so like Reid.
It is almost
impossible to
count the number of progres-
sive ideas that G. H. Reid
has been in favor of ever since
he assumed office State
Bank, State Land Bank, State
note issue, resumption of large
estates for closer settlement,
a good Navigation Act, re-
form of the Leg. Council, the
diminution of borrowing, a
good Local Govt. Act —and
Heaven knows-what besides.
And at time of writing every
one of them remains just
where it was four years ago.
M.L. Premier Seddon
upsets the theory that it is
necessary for a successful poli-
tician to have strong news-
paper backing. The Govt.
“ organ ” in Wellington has
never possessed half the in-
fluence of the rival Post,
and in Dunedin the Liberals
oertainly used to have a
journal of a kind, but it
shut down suddenly over
five years ago, and left its
two Tory contemporaries to
fume verbosely and point the daily finger of scorn
at Digger Dick. Neither of those hostile journals
has fever been known to allow that Richard was in
the right for. once, but their misguided readers
remain the most persistent of all that very bad
man’s supporters.
Govt, papers in Queensland are rejoicing
over the fact that all the Ministers were safely
returned at recent elections. Nothing unusual
about that. In 11 years only one Minister of
the Crown has b«en rejected by a Bananaland
constituency.
Premier Reid’s decision to appoint Labor
members (jo the Upper House seems to have con-
siderably damped S.M. Herald’s Federal ardor.
It would be the last straw in Topsyturvydom to
find Grandma approving of such a recognition of
the hornyhanded.
; After last N.S.W. election Sydney D.T.
constantly reminded its readers that “ at last we
have a Federal Assembly.” That paper how
praises heaven that “we ” have an anti-Federal
Council. If the D.T. would only reprint and re-
circulate its Federal issues of Aug., Sept., Oct.,
and Nov. last !
A .member proposes to prod N.S.W.
Leg. Assembly with a Bill declaring that any
Minister yvho leaves the province and remains a
whole month beyond its borders shall forfeit his
portfolio. With a provision attached allowing a
Minister to be absent by leave of the House, such
a Bill should have the good effect of killing such
abuses as the Want farce.
Dear Bulletin. —Can you inform a con-
stant reader if the financial expert who discourses
so fluently on the Braddon Biotin Sydney Sunday
Times is the same gentleman who advised us to
invest in Shellback scrip right up to the smash ?
Yours, Milparinka.
There are six candidates for the two-man
seat of Wallaroo (S.A.), now held by Hooper and
Grainger, and three of them, including present
member Hooper, are local preachers. Also, four—
present member Hooper again included—are tee-
totallers. Cheerful prospect for Wallaroo.
M’Millan, Wise and Bruce Smith per-
petuate the Parkes hatred of trimmer Reid and
scorn for his methods. Other politicians, have
been placated or converted, but the three named
breathe to-day the same aversion and contempt
which filled the Parkes parlor in the last year of
the old man’s life.
By no stretch of the imagination can one
of the small minority who voted against the
Enabling Bill in N.S.W. Assembly be termed
“influential.” Let G. Republican Dibbs publish
the name of the weighty man who dare not declare
himself on a national issue unless he had the pro-
tection of the ballot-box.
Jack Want’s opinion of the Amended
Federal Bill may or may not differ from his
opinion of the old Bill, but it is altogether un-
likely he would back up N.S.W. Leg. Council
in holding back the measure from the referendum.
Jack is too experienced a lawyer to openly
express his fear of the Jury’s verdict.
There is every sign of a huge rush of
candidates at the coming S.A. election. There
usually is in the saintly province. At the ’96
election not one candidate got in unopposed. The
mildest scrimmages were at Light, Mt. Barker,
Northern Territory and Stanley, in each of which
places there were three candidates for two seats ;
but at Yorke’s Peninsula the two seats were
scrambled for by nine applicants. Electoral
arrangements are rather curious in S.A., where
Encounter Bay in ’96 had two members for 2178
electors and E. Torrens two for 11,355.
“Capital is valueless without
labor,” said Sydney Telegraph the
other day in the course of a
fatherly admonition to the
*‘ working classes. ” Why,
certainly!! When Adam
came into the Book of
Genesis the first thing
he did was to go
to the bank and
get an overdraft.
OVERHEARD OUTSIDE THE PUB.
TATTERED PERSON : “ Wot’s the row, Jerry?”
JERRY : “ On’y th’ ole man. I bin barneyin' with
'im for about four hours. Mum idle me not
to leave 'im till I got some stuff or we'd get no
dinner to-morrer. So jest now 'e gives me
six bob out o' thirty-five."
T.P.: “ Wot did yer say?”
JERRY : “O, I tole 'im to go to 'ell, an' biffed 'im
on the bugle. 'E's tellin' 'is pals over there
'e'll fight me in the mornin ’ for anything from
a pound to a 'unded. A pint o' Tooth’s all
'e’ll fight, I'm full of'im. Come on."
Otherwise the human race would never have got
really started.
A Sydney branch postmaster, appointed
before last election as Deputy Registrar, piled the
work on to his assistant, who, though he had no
legal power to do so, issued rights wholesale. As
soon as the P.M. discovered his error he rushed
down and had the assistant appointed Assistant
Registrar. But the rights were abroad—issued
and signed by a totally unauthorised person.
Now, what about the validity of the holders’
votes ?
When news got abroad that Barcoo elec-
torate, from the roll of which 112 names were
illegally expunged by creatures of Q. Govern-
ment, had nevertheless been successful in again
returning Democrat Kerr, there was joy in
the ranks of Q. radicalism. The Govt, candidate
had the audacity to assert that this disfranchise-
ment of voters cost him the seat. Perhaps, how-
ever, he was right. It may be that the disgrace-
ful outrago’on justice turned many a dubious vote
in favor of the Labor candidate.
The Cabbage-tree sneer about “Premier
Reid having the support of the Melbourne papers
including those printed in this colony (N.S.W.)
as well as on the banks of the Yarra,” is typical of
that class of “ Federalist.” The anti-federal Sydney
l ij S / rutl i a . n ex 'Victorjan staff, and was
started (and is still controlled) by capital largely
subscribed in Melbourne and by ex-Melbourneites.
Ihere is certainly nothing of the abused Mel-
bourne Go ”in the slow old S. M. Herald,
while what is more tho-
roughly “Pure Syd-
ney ’’-than the E.
News 2
DREYFUS IN SYDNEY
DOMAIN.
FIRST DEADBDEAT : “ Who’s this yer
secret dosser wot’s kickin’ up all the row in France?”
SECOND DITTO: “ Dunno. S’pose he’s some bloke wot’s struck a pitch the cops can’t find.”
Macfarlane, M.P. (N.S.W.), declares that
the sugar districts are likely to go Cabbage-tree
on next referendum. This is the Macfarlane who
was decoyed by the same old George (with the
other sugar-members, including Meagher) into
voting against his party to keep Reid in power on
the plea that the preservation of the sugar-duties
depended upon the retention in power of the
gentleman who had solemnly promised to take
them off.
The mantle of No-Yes has fallen on Lyne,
whose speech to N.S.W. Chamber of Manufac-
tures (enthusiastic Federalists for the most part)
was worthy of a rail-sitter of the deepest dye.
By the time this sees print the erstwhile Oppo-
sition leader may have declared himself before the
Assembly, and the chances seem to favor his
going right against the Reid-Barton party. A
proceeding which will surely need much explain-
ing to the electors of the Hume.
Sydney Telegraph last Friday talked
scornfully about Premier Reid “cocking up with
the title of ‘hon.’ two or three coal-miners;”
also “ the brilliant idea of going down into coal-
mines with a batch of Legislative Council nomi-
nations ” and “ packing the Council with mine-
employees.” Considering that the Labor-party
in N.S.W. Parliament has been rather an anti-
Billious combination than otherwise, these angry,
jibes suggest that the D.T. has gone off its head
or taken to secret drinking.
Christchurch (M.L.) Weekly Press : “If
Mr. Seddon is not going to borrow, then the
railway which is necessary to join Auckland and
Wellington, and which will cost upwards of
<£1,000,000, will never be built.” Rats ! The
total wealth of Maoriland is estimated at nearly
<£200,000,000, and if .£1,000,000 can’t be found
out of that pile, without borrowing, to build a
valuable public work which will almost certainly
return per cent., then M.L. had better take in
its shingle and retire from business.
N.S.W. Col. -Sec. Brunker’s dolorous moo
about the scandals attaching to the N.S.W. Govt,
practice of appointing honorary magistrates comes
self-aecusingly from the man who has so long
played chief part in the nauseous game. In
the Parlces Govt, he was similarly industrious.
Why does he not, if sincere, table a bill to take
such patronage out of the clutches of Ministers ?
In a community which has spotted the balefulness
of the current system there is no salvation for the
man who merely bellows over its evils.
The late Queensland elections are not cal-
culated to make a Democrat go off his head with
joy. Yet there were certain cheerful phases of
the contest. One, the expulsion of certain notori-
ous “ rats ” from the Labor-party. A second still
more satisfactory feature was the cold shoulder
shown to aspiring members of the legal profession
who rushed into the political arena. Out of eight
fresh lawyer candidates only one, Rutledge, was
successful, and his success was only due to a
foolish splitting of votes on the other side.
Premier Turner is drafting an Old-Age
Pensions Bill for submission to Vic. Parliament
next session. Hardly anyone calls Turner a
democrat, because he doesn’t hang a big label on
himself to that effect. And yet, when one con-
siders his minimum-wage law (which he has been
game to enforce), his State land-bank, his law
for the resumption of large estates, his attempts
(which failed only because the property-elected
Council is wholly beyond his control) to enact
one-man-one-vote and to exclude cheap alien
labor, and his present old-age-pension scheme,
there is no prominent politician in Australia
whose record can compare with that of the present
Vic. Premier.
M.L. A. Spruson’s reference to the strangers’-
galleryites, and Premier Reid’s retort, recall a
former reference by R. C.. Luscombe (Parkes*
“ withered tarantula”) to the galleryites, and the
consequences thereof. Luscombe appealed from
an unsympathetic Assembly to “ its masters, the
people,” and indicated with a gesture the gal-
lery. “ Giraffe ” Taylor immediately pointed out
to the Speaker that Mr. Luscombe had drawn
attention to the presence of strangers, and under
the then existing rules of
the House, the galleries
- were at once cleared.
Perth Morning Herald warns the Sand-
groping people, like a naked Solomon Eagle crying
in a doomed city, that Federation will put an end
to border customs —which it certainly will—and
therefore land and income taxes will have to be
levied to make up the deficiency. The working-
class of the West should gum that warning in the
limited amount of hat the depression has left to
it. On the authority of the anti-Federal paper,
Federation is the one blessed institution which
will make the rich ’groper pay a fair share of the
public burdens.
The ’99 Queensland elections again empha-
sise the oft-repeated assertion that the backblocks
and the mining towns (one might add now—the
sugar towns) are the strongholds of Queensland
Liberalism. The towns dependent on Govern-
ment sops and patronage, such as Maryborough,
Ipswich and Townsville, are rotten to the core.
Also, the unspeakable cockatoo constituencies are
nearly all ardent admirers of Oily Jimmy’s policy,
while the Jap and Chow vote of Cooktown and
Thursday Island always goes straight for the
“plopputty Guv’ment.”
South Australia will have a great treble
event on 29th April—general election, referendum
on the Commonwealth Bill, and referendum on
the question of household suffrage for the Upper
House. The latter is to be taken on the Assem-
bly’s authority only; it is that body’s private
appeal to its own constituents for an expression of
opinion. This is the “outrage on the Consti-
toosh’n ” about which the Council stopped supplies
late in December ; but, as the Council got down
off its dignity and resumed supplies again early in
January, no serious breakage was done.
Nothing is so small that the anti-Federal
gang of N.S.W. can’t make it a grievance against
the Commonwealth Bill. Lyne’s latest curse, at a
recent gathering of N.S.W’. Chamber of Manu-
facturers, was that the late Premiers’ Conference
met in a “ hole-and-corner place ” ( i.e ., it met at
Melbourne, the largest city in Australasia; and
the largest, save Rio Janeiro and Buenos Ayres,
south'of the line), and that, though the terms of
the agreement arrived at have been published,
there is no verbatim report of all the conversation
and refreshments and cigars that happened while
that agreement was being talked over.
The enemy put a tremendous -weapon in
Premier Seddon’s hands over the Old Age Pension
system, and by the time Maoriland election comes
along, next December, it will probably begin to
realise the fact. Largely through the opposition
of the Tory party, the Old Age Pension law was
passed for three years only ; if it isn’t renewed in
1902 the whole thing will stop automatically.
And all the aged multitude, and all the multitude
which expects to be aged later on, remembers that
if it puts Russell in office the anti-Pensi'on crowd
will almost certainly be oil top when 1902 comes
round. The biggest cash inducement to vote for
Seddon that the country could have was supplied
by his opponents.

The jibe goes that you can always tell
when Premier George Reid sees danger ahead ;
for then he sits down at Parliament House and
affably plays dominoes with James M'Gowan,
head (or, rather, leader) of the Labor-party.
More or less actual conversation over the domino-
table between the pair (as reported by the malig-
nant Sydney D.T.): —
“ You must stick to me, Jim, now."
“ I will, George.”
“We’re getting into a tight place, Jim.”
“We are, George.”
“ But we have always been good friends, Jim ? ”
“ We have, George.”
“ You will stick to me, Jim ?”
“ I will, George."
The game goes on, then the silence is broken.
“ Things are beginning to look black, Jim ? ”
“They are, George.”
“ But you’ll stick to me, Jim? ”
“ I will, George.”
There is a shuffle. The game is slow. One of the players
is beginning to nod.
“ Are you down, George ?”
“Down ! (Wakes up in a fright). Don’t startle me
like that, Jim. Say, ‘ Can’t you go ! ’ It’s ominous, that
• down.’ But you’ll stick to me, Jim ? ”
“ Trust in me, George.”
“ I will, Jim.” (Sleeps).

“Junior Counsel ” on “ desertion ” and Bul-
letin’s note on Belton (Vic.) divorce-case :
The almost universal definition of “ desertion ” embraces
as one of its necessary elements “ the putting an end to
an existing state of cohabitation.” Hood, J., showed his
courage in 1895 (though then only a light-weight, in a
technical sense, of course—not weighed down by long ex-
perience on the Bench) by administering a heavy cross-
counter to this definition (as a hard-and-fast rule). In
Johnston v. Johnston (21 V.L.R.) he held that “deser-
tion ” was proved in case of man who seduced young girl,
married and left her, without living as man and wife.
The English courts have at last reached the same point
in the latest case (“latest” is a relative local term—we
are generally about three months behind actual English
decisions). Monsieur de Laubenque was a fascinating
Frenchman (who wasn’t a Frenchman, but a British
subject, from islands remote) with an (imaginary);
wealthy father in Paris and influential uncle to set him
up (a medical student) in large practice. The young
lady of 17, a Roman Catholic, failing to be sufficiently
overcome by these inducements to elope with him, he
married her at Registrar’s Office, drove with her to R.C.
Cathedral, married her there regularly, walked to church
door and left shortly after “ to legalise the marriage in
France.” Never cohabited with his “ wife.” After long
negotiations the Pope annulled the marriage —ratum sed
non consiimmatum— and a suit for divorce was brought.
Sir F. H. Jeunk, President of Probate and Divorce, again
got home on good, old, above-mentioned definition
(which is getting a bit “ out of form ”) by holding “ deser-
tion proved and granting a divorce.” In both these cases
the young “brides” had to prove “ willingness ” (not
“wishfulness ”) during desertion to enter on a state of
cohabitation. In neither case was “an end put to an
existing state of cohabitation.”
“ Melbourne ” on a deceased notable :
If our refulgencies go out as they have been doing this
week, we will have only farthing dips directly. Almost
in a day came news of the deaths of Hosie of the pies,
sec. Vasey, of the Gas Co., and Pastor Robinson (Presby-
terian), of St. Kilda. Hosie was a man who seemed to
lounge through life, like Book-Arcadian Cole, but these
are the sort that plan and carry out big things. Hosie’s
start was a mere transient Melb. appetite, a furore, for
Scotch pies, of which hardly any are eaten now ; but
Hosie knew when he had gorged the city stomach, and
was off on other specs, like all men of business genius,
who never look for birds in last year’s nests. So he was
gone upon Turkish baths, and all kinds of timely and
ephemeral fads in the hotel line. Nothing Big Clarke
ever did in charity is comparable to Hosie’s dab-down of
£9OOO years ago for the Homoeopathic Hospital, and the
public’ knew, or suspected, nothing of it till after his
death.
Angus and Robertson have prepared an
entirely new edition of Dyson’s “Rhymes from
the Mines,” printed from new type on fine paper,
and in the best style of the firm’s previous publi-
cations. The destruction of the stereos by fire
rendered necessary the re-setting of the volume.
“ Sherlock Holmes ” outrivailed. Any
reader wanting news of a missing relative, or a
copy of a will, certificate of birth, etc., or needing
a delicate inquiry made, had better write to J. W.
Holdswokth, the leading Melb. inquiry agent.*
“ Snakejuice ” writes :
What’s Reid’s little game now? People were under the
impression that, to pass the present Bill, Reid would
appoint to N.S.W. Upper House men who were in favor
of it. If that is so, how comes it that A. J. Gould is one
of the elected? The opposition of Mr. Gould to the last
Bill was one of the main factors in his defeat at the
general election. He opposed the Bill publicly and
privately. If the present Bill is much the same as the
last, how in the name of all that wriggles can Reid expect
support from Gould !
The Bulletin simply assumes that Gould has
slewed round like Brunker—and Reid. In any
case it is practically certain that Gould promised
to vote for the Bill before he was made an M.L.C.
and got his free railway pass returned to him.
This paper doesn’t mind much where votes come
from, and it will take even Gould’s. If that
icy person likes to get on the stool of repentance
when Brunker has finished weeping on it, why
shouldn’t he ?

“ Biter Bit ” : Re Sydney Safe Deposit, a friend
of mine, going: on holidays, got even with an enterprising
burglar recently. He took his plate, etc., to the Deposit,
and posted this notice inside his safe:—“My friend, I
regret you should have all this trouble for nothing. I
anticipated your call, and have left my valuables at the
Sydney Safe Deposit, in Ash-street, back of Paling’s. Try
there. I have also arranged so that when you open the
safe-door it warns the police. Au revoir.” The latter
was bluff, but I guess the e.b. scooted some.*

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Randvvick steeplechases are generally rather
sorry shows, and last Saturday’s race was no exception.
Fivrf started and dashed off at ’bus pace ; two promptly
fell*. The other three blundered along with big intervals
between, and Mangare eventually won by the length of
the straight. Parnell ran off at the last fence, hut poor
okhCardigan was so far behind that the jock, on Parnell
hail time to bring him back, jump the fence, and then
beat him home by about a furlong. Mangare is a Maori-
lander, who falls if he is taken at a fence at any bat, but
a nag doesn’t want pace to win a Sydney Steeple.

Merloolas very easily beat Lee-Metford and
Clarion intheAJ.C. Plate at Randwick on Saturday,
running the 3 miles in the very fair time of 5.31)4mm.
The pace set by Lee-Metford just suited the big, game
Queenslander, as it kept him from fighting for his head,
and at the finish he had it all his own way. Merloolas is
one of the hardest horses to ride in a race, as he won’t stay
on the rails, and fights all the way to get out wide. In
his work he has to be galloped right out on the outside
rails. ,
• • * *
Fairy Prince’s performance (2.35) in the Place
Handicap at Randwick, on Saturday, equals Survivor's
record for the mile-and-a-half. Up to a very short time
before, the raee started it was uncertain whether F.P.
wo'uld compete, as no “punter” was available and the
amount necessary to qualify had to be arranged for.
Consequently, the trainer had little or nothing on the
animal of which he is lessee, and, according to agreement,
must now part up half the prize-money to the owner.
Fairy Prince could have been bought a while hack for £2O.
Fairy Prince is by Stockdale out of a Stafford
mare, and hails originally from Camden Park, Macarthur-
Onslow’s homestead on the southern line. None of the
breed were ever raced before owing to the Macarthurs’
rooted objection to the sport.
The industry that flourishes most on Randwick
flat just now is “ticket-snatching.” The “snatcher”
simply stands beside a “ book,” and when a lucky inves-
tor comes along to collect his winnings, said snatcher
barefacedly grabs his ticket and sprints off, and, if bettor
chases him, he gets tripped up by the push and badly
trodden on. Apparently the snatchers have got the
officials and police quite beaten, for although writer was
on the flat each day of the recent meeting, and saw
several tickets grabbed, only one of these highwaymen (a
darkey) was removed from the course—and he was back
again within half-an-hour.

An old-time Bulletin prediction that a pony
would yet win one of the big Australian handicaps, has
been fulfilled by the victory of Diffidence in Sydney Cup.
She is the smallest animal that has ever won a two-mile
raee in Australia in first-class company. Her dam is the
Maribyrnong Handicap winner, Etraweenie, and her
grandam the grand old mare Nellie, who gave Trenton to
the turf.

The true inwardness of the purely-malevolent
and venal portion of an attack lately made upon “Tatter-
sall ” Adams down South will shortly become very
apparent to the public. Negotiations are proceeding
between a certain crowd and the Queensland Govt, for
the re-establishment of the sweep business at Brisbane.
Should permission be gained, certain enterprising people
with money behind them mean to have a big cut-in at
the business.
* * * «
Truth Norton’s allegation that duplicate
marbles have been drawn from “Tattersall’s ” barrel was
possibly an off-shoot from an incident in the St. Alban’s
stud lottery. When the numbers of the 130 prizes were
published Mr. James Gregg, Melb. manager for James
M’Ewan and Co., found himself the winner of a brood
mare. His ticket corresponded with-the number of the
animal on the advertised prize-list, but he got no notifi-
cation of his luck from "Tatt.” On putting his prize up
for sale Mr. Gregg found that somebody in Adelaide had
received “ Tatt.’s” telegram informing him that he had
drawn the same animal. Gregg sought a clear explana-
tion of the matter from head-quarters, but George Adams
merely gave him authority to sell his prize, so he sold it,
and to this day Mr. G. remains in the dark as to what was
done with the other man. He supposes that the other
man ranked also as owner of the horse, and made his own
terms with “ Tatt.,” who, at that rate, had to pay the price
of the twice-won prize out of his own pocket. Mr. G.
doesn’t know whether his ticket won the horse, and the
wrong man got the telegram, or whether the right man
gob the telegram, and the wrong number got into print.
He believes there was the mistake of a “0” in one case
or other : and, anyway, he swears by the integrity of
“ Tattersall.”

Punters (in Vic.) mostly seem inclined to take
Scorn as the best of the two-year-olds, but the Mari-
byrnong Plate victory of that otherwise unsatisfactory
performer doesn’t give it a great show for next season’s
blue ribbon. Chesney, judging from his good looks and
his consistently good “form,” ought to be the early
favorite for V.R.C. Derby.
* * * - •
The good luck of Bobadil in having had
“ nothing to beat undeniable. When his wins this
season were not in w.f.a. events he rarely had more than
a few 7 pounds the worst of the weights with his runner-up.
And who were the runners-up? George Frederick twice ;
Cocos once (subsequently Cocos beat Bobadil twice on
level terms); Lee-Metford twice (also Lee-Metford has
once beaten Bobadil and once dead-heated with him) ;
Alix once (Alix certainly was receiving considerable
weight from the winner), and Avalon once. On paper
Cocos is the champion 3-year-old of the year, and the
booming of Bobby is absurd. Here are Cocos's per-
formances from the time when he met W. R. Wilson’*
vaunted “ crack ” in Caulfield Guineas, giving him 41bs.
and finishing second. He won the Eclipse Stakes (1 mile)
at Caulfield, beating Wait-a-Bit and The Chief, who
carried lots of money, and dead-heated for second place.
Cocos had 71bs. the worst of it with the tw r o older horses.
Then he finished well up in Caulfield Cup race, after being
knocked out of all chance of winning by a catastrophe.
His next performance w 7 as the Derby win. Then he ran
third—only a length behind—to Grafter and Wait-a-Bit
for Melbourne Cup. At same meeting he beat Bobadil
and finished a head behind Lee-Metford (in receipt of
lOlbs.) for the valuable Spring Stakes, Lee-Metford being
disqualified for boring. And then Cocos broke down. .
Bobadil as a “ great” horse reads like a joke in
the light of Carbine’s record. Carbine met everything at
w 7 .f.a. or at a big disadvantage—and some of the horses
that finished second or third to him w 7 hen he won the
stake were ten times, Aberoorn four times, Dread-
nought five times, Lochiel twice. Highborn twice, Car-
iyon and The Admiral once each. Melos, it must be re-
membered, was good enough to win the A.J.C. Derby
and Leger, and carry 9st. 21b. into second place in the
Australian Cup which Dreadnought won. Highhorn won
Svdney Cup, carrying 9st., in the same season that
Carbine gave him 531 b. and a beating for the Melb. Cup.

“Scotty ” : The mare Thelma, which performed
so well at the late big N.S.W. show, is atout 11 years old.
When exhibited b.v her former owner she was not even
looked at, although a year younger, and in such con-
dition and coat that sports wrote to enquire on what she
was fed. But there’s a difference between a country
Lutcher and a “ toff,” and between Thelma, a fancy name,
and Myrtle, her late rather common one; and perhaps
there’s a difference in the judges, the judging, and ce
tainly in the judgment.

Twenty-six horses started in the last race at
Rosehill, Sydney, on a recent Saturday, and only five
were backed for money ; not a cent beyond a few long
shots to crowns or half-sovs. could be laid against any of
the other 21. And yet we have stewards who carpet
some poor uninfluential owner or trainer every now and
igain.

A large field of smart hacks went out for a
Dash Handicap at a minor M.L. meeting, March 16 (writes
a Bulletin correspondent), a mare with the Maori appel-
lation of Mongonui bolting away and winning by 15
lengths. The crowd looked on open-mouthed. It then
transpired that Mongonui was by Carbine—Moonga, and
full sister to the one-time much-fancied Melb. colt Bun-
dook, raced by the Millers.

sack, an uncord iered grandson of Musket, paid £75 16s.
tote-div. on the irdles; tickets 10s. each odds of about

a div. which the runner-up was also paying; while on

and returned £3O odd in a trot. Big divs. are the rule,
not the exception, in M.L.

Little Charles Dawson, the billiardist who
travelled to Australia last year on the strength of an
allegation that Roberts was afraid to “take him on” at
the “legitimate” game, has been duly taken on and
defeated by 1814 in a game of 18,000 up. The big,
grey - haired champion seemingly held his oppo-
nent safe throughout the race, but the cable re-
port doesn’t make it certain that the victory
would have been much more decisive but for gate-
money considerations. Probably it would. The match
was purely a gate-money business as far as Roberts was
concerned, whereas Dawson had every inducement to do
his darndest. A defeat of the remarkable old champion,
on level terms of one kind or another, is only a matter of
time, of course, but the time is not just yet. The history
of English billiards championship has been Roberts
to’ujo wrs, up to now. First there came the spot-stroke
discovery by the original Roberts, who had no rivals
among the men of his age. About 29 years ago, when
Roberts pere was only a little on the wane, the billiard
world heard to its astonishment that young William Cook
was a better spot stroker than the old professor, and that
John Roberts, junior, would be prepared to play Cook as
soon as the championship had gone out of the family.
Cook beat the original Roberts. Then young Roberts
came along and showed himself to be quite as much of a
champion as Cook. Their proficiency at the spot-stroke
grew wearisome, so a new championship table was devised
—a table that made long sequences of spot-strokes im-
possible. Roberts proved himself best man on this abor-
tion of a table, which he subsequently repudiated as a
failure. The public didn't care for the game under its
new-fangled championship conditions. Roberts then
became a law unto himself. He dropped the spot-stroke,
as being too dull and mechanical a means of exhibiting
his supremacy, and devoted himself to the all-round
game.
After taking them all down at the plain all-round
game, Roberts laid himself out for the cultivation of the
“push” stroke (which had always been sanctioned) in
“ nursery-cannons.” His supremacy as a nursery-cannon
pusher enabled him to give away 40 or 50 per cent, of the
points to anybody at the spot-barred game on an ordinary
English billiard table. He bossed the show for years, and
then young Dawson and others somewhat meanly con-
spired to reduce the gap between themselves and the old
man by declaring the “ push” to be a foul stroke, though
there had never been any doubt that—to quote an axiom
coined bv Tiie Bulletin—" he plaveth best who pusheth
best.” Dawson challenged Roberts to play him with the
push barred, which meant that the champion of 28 years’
standing had to re-practise parts of the ali-round game at
which he had grown rusty whilst he was sticking so
clos-ly to the push cannons. They took away his trump-
card, but he beat them all the same.
* m m *
A humorous row started in Perth W.C.T.U.
over the decision of the executive of that body, in start-
ing a “ Leisure Hour Club, ’ to include a billiard-room
amongst the club diversions. Idea was to snatch male
brands from the burning—or, rather, from the drowning
—at the pub., by inducing them to play billiards under
the eye of the W.C.T.U. ladies, and in a place where
nothing stronger than ginger-ale was sold. The billiard-
table was started, hut it burst up Perth branch of the
W.C.T.U., which disbanded as a protest, when the mem-
bers, according to published account, “ in sorrow and
regret removed their white ribbon-bows.” The “Y”
Branch, otherwise the young ’uns, however, supported
the billiard-table and let the old ’uns slide ; and, despite
the latter’s disbandment, the W.C.T.U., led by an aggres-
sive propagandist named Mrs. Clarke, still flourishes in
Perth.
The billiard-table question soon found its way
into the Perth papers, and became the chief silly-season
topic, which “Pro Bono Publico,” “Constant Reader,”
and other well - known writers, emerged from their
shells to discuss. The correspondence, according to
latest files, was still being carried on with vigor. Con-
tributors were divided into two sharply-defined sections,
one of which pictured the billiard-table as a sanctified
implement of pastime, while the other regarded it as an
engine of the devil.

Wood-chopping contest at Agricultural Society’s
Gronn Is (Sydney), last week, drew a big crowd (8000) and
created great interest on a wet afternoon; Twenty-three
brawny, tawny-pelted bushmen, with axes keen as
razors, competed. Among them were four brothers—
Ernest, Caspar (last year’s winner and runner-up respec-
tively) William arid J. J. Heckenberg (Liverpool, N.S.W.)
all fine, sturdj, upstanding sons of the soil, who were
confidently expected by their supporters to cut up the
£5O prize-money. But M’Kindlty,' erst of Victoria and
Tasmania, and now of Clarence River, split the quarter
and won in 2min. 12|sec., with William, Casper and
Ernest Heckenberg second, third and fourth, as named—
J.J. having gone down in the fourth heat before the ulti-
mate winner. Every man among the four placed was
over 6ft. high, and the way each handled his implement
was a revelation. Logs were spotted gum 16in. through
and about 4ft. round. MTvinolty’s style was the easiest.
While others knocked chips off he hewed V-shaped
chunks. Writer heard, on good authority, that M’Kinolty
has a record of lmin. 32sec. for a similar contract.
’Tis said M‘Kinolty originally came from the
Land of the Wooden Ham, where he earned fame with
his axe, and settled in Huon district (Tas.). Has since
won championship of Victoria (under-hand cutting), 1888
and (two 6ft.-girth-logs) 1896; big handicap and cham-
pionship Tas. (1896), and N.S.W. championship at Maclean
(C.R.) May 24 last. M’Kinolty works left-handed and
takes to under-cuts best.

Sturdy Jack Conlon, aggressive forward of the
Pirates F.C., and Ned Burden, virtual lightweight cham-
pion pug. of N.S.W., met at Golden Gate A.C. (Sydney),
Saturday night last, for a £4O-purse and wager £5O
a-side. Upwards of 1000 people squeezed into the hall,
and sweltered there over two hours without an inch of
elbow-room: you couldn’t have cut the “air” with an
axe. Hundreds, unable to gain admission, stood outside,
eagerly gulping down whatever information the door-
keeper passed out concerning the progress of the fight.
Fight! It Was anything but that. Conlon stood inches
over Burden, had a stone or more the better of the
weights, and was in superb condition ; but after nearly
outing his man in the third round, and having him
tottering in the sixth, he refused to mix it except on rare
occasions, being content to keep as far away from the
enemy as the hempen bound iry of the 24ft. square would
permit. The crowd |ollied Conlon unmercifully. “Give
Burden a bike and then he might catch the big fellow,”
they screeched, and every time Conlon advanced away
from the centre he was hoo-hooed, and advised to look
for an engagement at the Tivoli. In the 16th round
Conlon badly damaged his opponent’s left eye with two
heavy left-hand jabs. At the termination of the 20th
three minutes the referee declared the match a draw, and
thus ended an exceedingly tame contest, rendered more
so by the fact that it had been the talk o’ town for weeks.
* * * *
The much-talked-of Conlon-Burden fight, Satur-
day night, last, demonstrated the extreme poorness of
N.S.W. boxing form. “Gentleman” George Dawson,
“ Shadow ” Maher, or Griffo, as they were in early part of
, present decade, could go through the lot and think no
rtiore of the effort than -they would of an ordinary spar.

Novice boxing-tournaments have been the vogue
in Sydney for some time, and writer has experienced
much amusement in watching said novices weighed at a
certain Sydney club. Before first round begins, spring-
balance scales are brought in with much flourish and
suspended from a beam across the roof. Referee gravely
points to a piece of paper pasted on face of scales, and
informs the spectators that any man who pulls the indi-
cator lower than the position marked on the paper exceeds
the limit and will have to stand down ; but nobody ever
does stand down, though all get perilously near the brink.
Wonder if it’s possible for the indicator to pass that scrap
of paper? Writer has seen apparently-llst. men taking
part, in fist, tournaments, and heard their fellow-com-
petitors complain about it. Novices are scarce, but
their rough-and-tumble style of fighting draw's, and up to
date promoters do not split straws over letting ’em in at
a lb. or two over the limit.

Veteran bruiser Abe Hicken is now in Sydney.
Writer remembers Abe’s great battle with L. Foley at
Echuea, on the Murray, 20 years ago. No Australian
fistic duel, before or since, caused such a sensation.
Police were badly bafHed. Thousands of pounds were
lost and won, and the winner of the match, Foley, got a
royal reception at every station when returning to Melb.
by train. Later—upon arriving in Sydney—he was pre-
sented with 1000 sovs. at the old Vic. Theatre, amid a
scene of great enthusiasm. 31 years since Hicken fought
and heat Maguire at New York (U.S.A.) for the light-
weight championship of Yankeedom, breaking the
American’s jaw. Abe is 54, while Foley is six years
younger.

Looks as if Griffo, the incomparable—perhaps
the greatest boxing freak the world has yet produced—
will end his days in a lunatic asylum. No sooner is he
out of gaol than in he goes again. They released him at
Chicago (U.S.A.), Jan. 4, after a long stretch, and he
straightway went on a wild jag, and was arrested again.
Half-a-dozen officers had a bad time before securing their
man.

Delegates of N.S.W. Amateur Swimming Asso-
ciation have discussed “Mud” Bishop’s lmin. 1 3-ssec.
performance for 100yds. at Fitzroy Dock (Sydney), last
week, and, though some stoutly advocated allowing it to
go as a world’s-record for a straightway course, others
just as strenuously objected on account of the strong
wind that blew down the water at the time it was put up.
Ultimately, it was decided to refer the matter to the
’Ome swimming authorities, and ask how they would act
under the circumstances.

Australasian champion-swimmer Freddy Lane
caught the England-bound Orient liner Omrah at Melb.,
but prior to going aboard had a 100yds. flutter over a
straightway course in Hegarty’s baths, St. Kilda, with the
Vic. champion sprinter, Pearson, and beat him by 7 or
Byds. in lmin. 4 3-ssec. Smart going, considering the
speedy little Sydneyite had been travelling all the night
before without sleep.

The drowning of Melb. yachtsmen by the foun-
dering of the Queenie on Easter Sunday again emphasises
the riskiness of yachting in Port Philip, which is prac-
tically an inland sea. There are ten times the number of
capsizes in Sydney Harbor, yet the drowning of an ex-
perienced yachtsman is there very rare. The southei’n
fatalities are due partly to the immense sailing area and
partly to the comparative incompetence of southern
yachtsmen. Half those who have strutted in brass
buttons since the arrival of Gov. Brassey don’t know a jib-
sheet from peak-halliards, Not so, however, with the
drowned Clarks—all yachtsmen from infancy.
* * * *
Young Johnson, one of the victims of the re-
cent yacht disaster in Hobson’s Bay, had evidently
reached the pier at Werribee, because his hands clutched
a quantity of mussels, which must have been torn from
the pier piles when he sought to support himself after
his long swim. It was then probably that he was attacked
by sharks. Sad as the affair was all round, Johnson’s
case seems hardest, by reason of his almost escape.

Mark Foy has given Joe Donnelly an order
for a boat for England to meet the Maid of Kent. She is
to be of the Maid’s class a very different sort to the old-

Bike-raping bookmakers in Victoria are now
appearing with “Licensed by the L.V.W.” on their
leather bags. The League’s recent meeting at Melb.
Exhibition track revealed some of these half-fledged Ikeys
as bawlers who had paid a five “ bob ” registration fee for
the privilege of laying the odds in “ a place within the
meaning of the Act.” So much for the League’s alleged
determination to check roguery on wheels. The unlaw-
ful parasite, having paid his footing, is practically licensed
to rob the public. Anyway, he doesn’t meet his liabilities
in sundry cases, and the League which pockets his dollar
leaves the young blackguard to slink away rejoicing. It
ought to be about time that lawyer Robert Best cut the
connection between the Vic. Ministry and bicycle sport,
for if he remains a member of the League’s new licensing
board, the nickname of “ Five-Bob ” Best will stick to him
for ever.
Young Hack, who was chosen to play against
the Australian team in Adelaide, stands 6ft. 2in., and is
prophesied to be a future international player. He has

laide clubs, but now heads the S.A. averages in club
matches.

Six and one-day bicycle races are the rage in
’Frisco. In a recent 24 hours’ go two men covered 459
miles, and the next two 455. The miserable wretches ride
the whole 24 hours w thout dismounting.
The Fremantle Strike.
The lumpers’ strike at Fremantle (W.A.) has
come to an end after the. Forrest Government
had made of itself nearly every kind of ass
that was possible in the circumstances. The
trouble began over a proposed reduction of
wages. It wasn’t a very large reduction, and,
in the reduced circumstances of Westralia, the
employes might possibly not have objected very
much, though even a small -reduction was a
serious matter to them ; the drop from Is. 3d.
to Is. per hour, and from 2s. to Is. Bd.
per hour for overtime, with the 2s. 6d. per
hour for Sunday work reduced to 2s. 3d.,
doesn’t look much, but when there is also a
grievous falling off in the number of hours’
work available each week it becomes serious.
Bub when the Lumpers’ Union asked the union
of steamship owners to meet and talk the
matter over, the latter haughtily refused to
recognise any union of employes, or to deal
with any such union, or to admit of its
existence, and then the row commenced in
earnest. It wasn’t so much a dispute over wages
as over the*right of the employes to combine
as well as the employers. Had the conference
been held the men might have given way over
the wages, but on the question of their right to
have a union and to have its existence recog-
nised there was no surrender. And the Govern-
ment, in its indecent haste to help the steam-
ship owners to cub down wages and destroy
unionism, made an unspeakable fool of itself.
It proceeded to reduce the wages of its truckers
on the same scale, or one closely resembling it,
and thereby identified itself with the owners.
In the midst of the shindy the German liner,
Essen, arrived at the port. The Government
would only allow cheap blackleg labor to put
cargo into its trucks, and there wasn’t enough
of it available. The agents of the Essen offered
to engage union labor, and. to load the trucks
at their own (not the railway department’s)
expense, and the offer was refused. Then the
German steamer departed with strange curses
and took most of its Fremantle cargo away with
it. Considering that W. A.’s cheap-labor Govern-
nienfc has been struggling for many months
to get Fremantle made a port of call for
the German mail-boats this cheerless reception
was woefully bad policy. Another weird
feature of the case is that while the lumpers
are W.A. citizens and taxpayers, and spend
their money in the provinces, the Steamship
Owners Association is almost purely an outside
institution. All the shipping which W.A.
owns itself is barely one-third that of Tas-
mania and about one-twentieth that of N.S.W.
So the money saved by the owners off the
wages of the local men would be taken out of
the country, and the gross income of W.A.
proportionately reduced; and the Forrest
Government was indirectly helping to diminish
the resources of its own country for the benefit
of outsiders. In the end the owners so far
climbed down as to meet the employes’ union
and arbitrate, and the greater part of the pro-
posed reduction was accepted. So the Govern-
ment, which stumbled clumsily into the busi-
ness without knowing exactly how it was doing
it, now stumbles out again, and the axe is care-
fully interred all round.
Last week three sentences of death were
passed at N.S.W. assizes, and in none of them, it
is safe to say, will the sentence be carried out.
Which is indeed farcical.
Sydney D.T. observes that the number of
applicants for the post of Prof, of Physics at
Sydney University is very small. But, on the
other hand, it seems rather startling that 20
scientific men in England, of whom 19 are bound
to be disappointed, should be prepared to come
such a distance for so moderate a salary and into
a narrow sphere where there is always the danger
of stagnation—an ever-present fear to a Univer-
sity lecturer in a sense that does not apply to an
astronomer or a botanist. To the latter a new
and wide field like Australia is practically invalu-
able. Out of these 20 names, three have been
selected and sent to Sydney University Senate
for final choice.
Groom at Toowoomba :
He had seen the place grow from a village of 150 people
to a town of 13 or 14 thousand people, As he looked back
on the long vista of years gone by he remembered that
there were now lying in God’s Acre many 7 of their rude
forefathers who had risked ... to support him at his
first election.”
Every few years Toowoomba comes to the con-
clusion that sinuous old W. H. G. is an oleaginous
humbug. As soon, however, as William comes
to the “God’s Acre” and “rude forefather”
business the lachrymose town rises up suddenly,
embraces him with unspeakable emotion, and
votes him into the House again.


THE BEAUTY OF THE
EVIASSEY-HARRIS
BICYCLE
Has always beenfamous. This year
we have surpassed all previous
efforts and produced a bicycle as
near perfection as our skill
and the practically unlimited re-
sources of our great factories can
make it. The design is elegant.!
and graceful, and every detail
of workmanship and finish has been.'
brought to tempting ideality.
ONE GRADE ONLY
THAT THE HIGHEST.
We confine our efforts and the efforts
of every one of the 500 skilled,
mechanics in our factories to the
perfecting of one model, one
only; and no maker who scatters his
energies over half a dozen models
can hope to compete with us. For
years we have tested, improved and
perfected this one model of
Massey-Harris Bicycle
until, we believe, it is superior in
every way to any other bicycle that
has yet been bui.t.

OTICE OF TESTAMENTARY
BEQUESTS.
The Late JAMES WEIR
of Saint Clouds Blackrockin the County of Dublin
Esquire by his Will dated 12th of October 1893
bequeathed the following legacies amongst others
namely :—One thousand pounds to Mrs. Rachel
Sandiland; One thousand pounds to the children
of the late Andrew Brown ; One thousand pounds
to each of the seven children of Testator’s wife’s
sister. Isabella Fallow, namely James Fallow,
William Fallow, John Fallow, Gavin Fallow,
Janet Fallow, Maty Fallow, and Agnes Fallow.
One thousand pounds to Mrs. Grace Barr,
formerly Steele. One thousand pounds in equal
shares amongst the children of John Steel son of
-Mary Steel; One thousand pounds to the issue
living at the death of the Testator of James Weir
who died in his lifetime ; One thousand pounds to
each of the six children of Testator’s brother
Thomas Weir deceased, namely James Weir,
Francis Weir, Andrew Weir, Agnes Weir, Eliza-
beth Weir, and Margaret Weir.
The Testator recited that sonie of the persons
who might be entitled to legacies under his Will
were, the Testator believed, resident in America,
Australia and New Zealand, and it contained the
following clause: “I hereby declare that every
person entitled to a legacy Under this my Will
shall within a period of three years from the day
of my death send to my Trustee or Trustees a
claim (in writing) for such legacy and any person
who shall not send in such claims as aforesaid
shall absolutely forfeit all benefit which he or she
might have otherwise claimed under this my Will
and the Legacy hereinbefore bequeathed Jb him or
her shall be dealt with as a lapsed legacy.” And!
the Testator directed his Trustees as soon as con-
veniently might be after his death to cause
advertisements to be inserted in newspapers
requiring all persons entitled to legacies to send in
their claims. The Testator died 30th October,
1898, and said Will and one Codicil were on the
18t.h November, 1898, duly proved by Sir William
Findlater, Robert Bell, James Anderson Merry
the Executors and Trustees thereof.
Now all such of above-named Legatees as have
not already done so and all other (if any) persons
claiming to be Legatees or to be beneficially entitled
under the said Will and Codicil are hereby re-
quired to send in the said Executors and Trustees
at the office of the undersigned solicitors claims
(in writing) and the necessary proofs of identifica-
tion, and the Trustees will at the expiration of a
period of three years after the death finally wind
up the Estate and distribute the then remaining
assets of the Testator without reference to any
claims except those which shall have been sent
in within said period. The Executors have col-
lected and realised a very large proportion of the
Testator’s assets and they have paid the Testator’s
debts and thus will shortly be in a position to pay
the above mentioned legacies and to distribute
their Testator’s Estate (except of course such part
of the residuary property as it may be necessary
to retain three years).
The Executors believe that they already possess
the addresses of the abovenanled legatees but
for extra precaution and in pursuance of their
Testator’s directions publish this advertisement
and particularly request each named or indicated
legatee to send in a formal written claim without
further delay.

Congratulations to Mr. George Coppin, who celebrated
bis 80th birthday on April Bth.
The author of “ The Belle of New York ” has a curious
way of disarming criticism. Upon the programme is
printed: “In extenuation —the author begs to say that
whatever the play may be, it is all that is claimed for it.’
The engagement of Henrietta Watson for Miladi, in
“The Three Musketeers,” is an inspiration. Mrs. Brown-
Potter looks the part, but Miss Watson has the very
style for it. One fancies Cecil Ward as Aramis—compare
Maurice Leloir’s splendid illustrations to Dumas’ master-
piece and you have Cecil Ward looking at you from the
page. But what of Athos, Porthos, and D’Artagnan ?
Thi- e is no ideal D’Artagnan on Australian soil just now,
and without a first-rate D’Artagnan what would the
“ T n ee Musketeers” be ? Besides, imagination demands
a d ishing fellow to play up to such a Miladi as Miss
Watson must surely be.
“ It is as certain as sublunary arrangements of any kind
can be,” says Sydney D.T.’s London correspondent, “ that
you will shortly see Irving in Australia, unaccompanied,
however, by Miss Terry. Irving’s recent seasons at the
Lyceum are understood to have been financially disas-
trous, and he is anxious to follow Wilson Barrett’s ex-
ample and recoup his losses touring.”
Charles Godfrey (who, on his own admission, has within
recent years enjoyed £2500 a year income) is bankrupt in
London ; debts only £l4O. 111-health prevents him at
present from fulfilling an engagement worth £3O a Week.
Fritz Mueller, the young Vic. native pianist, has his
fat her’s nationality stamped on every feature of his face.
When he is sent to Germany as an Australian musical
genius, how the Deutschers will smile !
The Drama as an Elevating Influence. Recently staged
at Oollingwood Town Hall, a four-act shocker entitled
“The Boot-Box Tragedy.”
During the last night of the “ White Heather” at Melb.
T.lt., as soon as Lady Godiva began to unrobe, there
arose from the front row of stalls an elderly and obvious
back-blocker, who advanced to the end of the orchestra
and, resting his chin on his arm, gloated for a full five
minutes, drawing meanwhile long and very audible
breaths of unspeakableness.
The hilarious chorus of “Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay,” which
was in everybody’s mouth a few years ago, is
almost extinct now. Still it isn’t quite forgotten. The
other day a sivagman, perishing of thirst 70 miles north
of Oodnadatta, on the great lone north road leading to
the centre of Australia and Port Darwin, scratched the
ri liculous old shout on his billy—and then died. Why
any man should want to “ Ta-ra-ra-boom ” in such hard
circumstances as these no one is ever likely to know.
Dear Bulletin. —A paragraph appeared in a recent
issue attributing to me the designs for certain furniture
used in “ Under the Red Robe.” Let me disclaim the
authorship. The designs were taken from “Pugin’s
Examples,’’and were admirably executed by Mr. Hassan.

The bulk of “The Belle of New York” co., it seems,
was not selected by George Musgrove, and three of the
importations from ’Murka are not appearing in the show
at Melb. Princess’s.
Melb. Argus, praising the humor of actor Girard’s per-
formance in “ Belle of New York ” —“ He also propounds
some quaintly-flavored bits of philosophy, as his reply to
the ladies’ query whether married men live longer than
single ones, ‘ It seems longer.’ ” The question Tiie Bul-
letin would like to ask is, whether the comedian who
hurls that aged chestnut at an audience ought to be more
severely punished than the newspaper which accepts it
as new ?
John Plummer to The Bulletin “ As the individual
responsible for the introduction of Clement Scott to
London Figaro, of which I was working editor, let me
say that whatever fault may be found with his later
dramatic criticism, in those days they were the most
honest and outspoken in London, and did much. to get
rid of the wishy-washy style formerly in vogue. Both on
London Figaro and Weekly Dispatch he had a perfectly
free hand, and only once within my experi*-nce had I
occasion to expunge a sentence of his. It led to a row
between us, but saved the paper from a lawsuit. As
regards giving lectures in Australia, I have already
advised him to the contrary, and reminded him of the
failure of Arthur Sketchley, our mutual friend, who was
disgusted to find Australians unable to appreciate his
creation of ‘ Mrs. Brown, and her Adventures in the New
Cut and other London localities.’ ”
The London cast of “What Happened to Jones” in-
cludes five people well-known to Australians—Charles
Arnold and his wife (Miss Frederic), Sass and his wife
(Miss Emma Gwynne), and Miss Ada Lee. The 250th
night of “ Jones ” was souvenired last month.

Ada Reeve, at latest London dates, was supplementing
her success with Arthur Roberts, in musical coined}', by
appearing at the Palace Music Hall, where her “ turn ” is
exactly the same as she gave for Rickards’s £6O a week in
Melbourne and Sydney—" Only a Penny,” “ Simple Little
Maiden,” and “ Love Me, Sue.”
A Melb. hotelkeeper shows in his window the bill of

R. Younge ; Cassio, Burford ; Brabantio, Rogers ;
Duke, Hooper; Roderigo, Hydes; Emilia, Mrs. C. Young,
afterwards Mrs. Vezin. Mrs. Young married at 15, in
Launceston, to comedian Charley Young, He died in
Sydney. The Desdeinona of Brooke’s opening night was
Fanny Catheart, afterwards Mrs. Heir and Mrs. Darrell.
Sister of J. F. Cathcart.
Will Whitburn begun as a little boy negroio performer.
Then he became groom to Dr. Gunst, the eminent
homoeopath. The favor bestowed on him at the Temper-
ance Hall led to his adopting the regular stage. Pony-
racing is his hobby, wherefore he never appears at
matinees. He has held every Melb. engagement as long
as he liked, but Sydney did not care ‘for him.
J. C. Williamson and Brough have to pay income-tax
to the Vic. and N.S.W. Govts, on the earnings of Gilbert
and Sullivan, Pinero, and other dramatic authors whbse
works they produce here. The English author insists on
the fees, and as the income-tax has to be paid by some-
body it has to come out of the managers’pockets. But
it is rough that these should have to pay tax on Income
they certainly don’t enjoy. They are really taxed on
their payments, not on their earnings.
Melb. newspapers, reflecting severely on Robert
Brough’s ill-success in the Bijou and Princess’s, gave
themselves away, since throughout the season they
cheerfully reported “large and enthusiastic” audiences.
Local theatre-goers now stand charged with the offence
of neglecting dramatic talent and clever plays, and dis-
couraging a manager of discrimination and ability by
persistently crowding bis theatres to the doors, and
showering rapturous applause upon , his people and his
plays.
Dampier was playing Hamlet at Adelaide Royal t’other
night, and, when he came to Yorick’s skull, in the grave-
yard sc-ne, a dog jumped upon the stage, gazed in-
quiringly at the property-skull, and went off disgusted.
The quadruped had mistaken it for a real bone.
“C.C.” : A Sydney daily expresses surprise that Rig-
nold does not make Othello begin his wild career of
jealousy somewhat earlier in the play. But, histrionically
correct or not, Othello’s unsuspiciousness isn’t half so
startling as Desdemona’s later on. Judging by her shrieks
during the operation, Desdemona didn’t at ail want to be
smothered. And considering that the custom of the time
was to knife or smother a faithless wife without troub-
ling a divorce-court, the wonder is that even the
absurdly-innocent young thing could have gone to bed as
she was bidden, without first locking the door and push-
ing the chest of drawers against it to keep her lord and
master out. Thoughts of this sort obtruded "themselves
during the play, and sounded even louder than the gilt
buttons which showered off Cassio in the last act when he
was dragged off the stage trying hard not to smile.
“ The Divorce Court has just robbed,” writes The Bul-
letin’s London correspondent, “ Florence Ethel Sproule,
actress, of Sydney, of her ‘ Buckley’s chance ’ for the role
of Countess of Durham. In ’BB Florrie married Hon.
D’Arcy Lambtori, eighth son of the late Earl and oneof 13
‘ progenies ’ that blossomed in the ancestral hall within
16 years. St. Bartholomew’s, Pyrmont, cast its blessing
upon the twain and straightway Florrie became Flossie
and giddyish. There were several of them, but only three
figured in the invoice list —the last, one- Berridge, being
regarded by petitioner as an asset, and so was cast for
costs. The frail Antipod, in a long and doleful screed,
acknowledged all, and more : 1 they were strangers,’ etc.,
was the text of it, strongly embrocated with alcoholic
absorption and economical veracity. The present Lord
Durham is, if possible, more unlucky than the possible
future one,, his wife being a hopeless lunatic in perfeot
bodily health and an asylum."
That storm in Sydney Philharmonio tea-oup over the
wider privileges given to orchestral members was amus-
ing while it lasted. Full half the orchestral players are
accomplished prof, musicians, and the society stood the
risk of losing its most effective section for the sake of a

Mme. Frances Saville has been complaining to N.Y.
Herald that her operatic-studies are disturbed by the
swarm of barrel-organists who infest the district where
she has her “flat.” At about the time when Frances
Saville uttered her bitter cry, brother Jules Simonsen was
getting arrested for burglary. Destitution drove him to
it, he said. Yet, if poor Jules had only thought to borrow
an organ, and grind it all day long outside his sister's
house, she would doubtless have bribed him handsomely
to go away. Lots of musicians earn a good living by
being paid to move on.

The Voice of the M’Million.
Ex-Treasurer M'Millan on N.S.W. finance
under Premier Reid :
The finances of this country had never yet been placed
upon a sound foundation. During: the last three or, four
years .there never had been a solid, legitimate surplus;
and he would go further, and say that outside the ques-
tion of policy, whether of Freetrade or Protection, or a
particular kind of taxation, it ought to be the duty of
the press and of both sides of the House, and especially
should it be the duty of the great press of this country
which employed experts high in economical and financial
fame to weigh the public statement of their accounts,
and to see that everything was put fairly and clearly
before the public, and that they were not in any way
misled as to the real state of the finances. Now,
they might have a cash system, and still have a
very rotten system of finance. The key of finance was in
the loan estimates. If they put into the loan estimates
those things which ought to come out of legitimate
revenue, they were committing a fraud upon the finances
of the country. (Cheers). He said without any hesita-
tion that there never was a period in the history of this
country when the loan account was so used for purposes
that ought to be defrayed out of general revenue.
(Cheers). Then there had been a system introduced in
place of the one where they used to spend out of ordinary
revenue about £200,000 a year upon small matters; such
as post-offices, gaols, and so on. But a very ingenious
system has been invented to get that out of the revenue
by means of a thirty years’ sinking fund. Well,
that was a very nice thing for the man who came
in first, because everything was put over for 30 years—
(laughter)—and during the ordinary tenure of any Pre-
mier’s life, even if he remained 10 years Premier, he might
only have to pay a very small proportion of these loans.
He would only have to pay from year to year the interest
on each fresh loan of the previous year, and one-thirtieth
of the whole, and only a small aggregation arising out of
the others. Now, what was the use of this system ? In
a certain number of years the interest on these loans,
when the present Treasurer would be out of office, would
be equal to the total expenditure—(laughter)—and was it
not far better and far more straightforward to pay this
straight away from the revenue of each year, instead of
imposing upon the country a sort of bogus loan system
which was only meant to help the present, and to be
liabilities put forward on to posterity ? (Cheers).
The. Bulletin regards this as very kind and
complimentary of ex - Treasurer M'Millan.
For The Bulletin is the only paper in N.S.W.
which has constantly pointed out for four years
past that N.S.W. charges more of its ordinary
expenditure to loans than any other province ;
that this swindle has been growing worse and
more glaring every year since Reid took office ;
that Reid’s surpluses were purely bogus ; that
he has faked the public accounts by steadily
cutting down the Works expenditure out of
revenue till it now stands at only £597,000,
against £1,487,000 in ’9l, and by using loan
.money to make up the difference ; and that his
finance has been a sham and a lie all along.
And if ex-Treasurer M‘Millan had talked a
good deal more in this strain while he was in
politics it might have been a good deal better
for politics.
The Sabbath Paper’s Arithmetic.
Sydney Sunday Times’s latest anti-Federal in-
vention :
HOW THE TARIFF WILL WORK OUT.
One of the largest firms in Sydney has, in response to a
request, supplied the Sunday Times with the following
table, showing the difference in prices now charged the
public for the undermentioned classes of goods and the
prices that will be charged should the present Federal
Bill pass:—
Present Prices for Calicoes, Flannels, Flannelettes,
Blankets, Piece Dress Goods, Clothing, Shirts, Hosiery,
Mercery, Bootware, &c.
London Invoice .. .. .. ... £lOO 0 0
Importing Charges ... . .. .. .. 10 0 0
Cost in Warehouse .. .. .. .. 11000
Warehouseman’s Profit, say, 25 per cent. 27 10 0
Charged to Retailer .. .. .. .. 137 10 0
Retailer’s Profit, say, 331-3 per cent. .. 45 16 8
Charged to the Public £lB3 6 8
Equal to 83 1-3 per cent, above London invoice cost.
That is, in respect of all the articles enumerated above,
the public at present pay 83 1-3 per cent, above London
invoice cost. Now see below :
11.
Prices for above goods that will be charged under a
Federal tariff, when probably a 30 per cent, ad valorem
duty will be imposed—
London Invoice £lOO 0 0
Importing Charges 10 0 0
30 per cent, duty, equal to 33 per cent, on
Invoice Cost 33 0 0
Cost in Warehouse .. . . .. .. 143 0 0
Warehouseman's Profit, say, 25 per cent. 35 15 0
Charged to retailer 178 15 0
Retailer’s Profit, say, 331-3 per cent. .. 59 11 8
Charged to Public £238 6 8
Equal to 138 1-3 per cent, above London invoice cost, and
55 per cent, above the present prices charged to the
public.
In otherwords, for every pound’s worth purchased now
31s. will have to be paid under the Federal tariff.
Present Price—2os. Price after Federal Bill passed—3ls.
The Sunday Shellback makes even a worse
failure here than usual. For £238 6s. Bd. isn’t 55
per cent, above £lB3 6s. Bd. by a long way ; it is
£55 above it right enough, but that is only 30 per
cent. And the difference between the present
price and the one which the Sunday Shellback
assumes will be charged after Federation is not
the difference between 20s. and 31s. but between
20s. and 265. The Shellback paper simply adds
on ss. to make its case look better. Of course the
30 per cent, federal tariff on which the whole
thing starts is purely the Sabbath tipster’s
assumption, but that is a mere'side' issue ; the
wild joy of the thing lies in the assertion that
“ one of the largest firms in the city ” made these
awful arithmetical blunders. A paper which
doesn’t know 30 per cent, from 55 is. indeed a
beautiful guide on any financial problem.
An undoubted centenarian passed away

A strange advertisement from Brisbane
Courier :—“ Gentleman (in diplomatic career)
desirous of entering the matrimonial sphere, is in
quest of a partner, thoroughly accomplished;
applicant must be in society, and, if possible, have
frequented some European Court. Address, De
Rohen, this office.” Diplomatic career !
Eloquent scrap of storm-reporting from
S.M. Herald :
Yesterday the sun rose thickly veiled by inky cloud-
banks, which at intervals broke, letting down a torrent of
rain for a few seconds now, and then minutes,' when,
driven by the tearing force of the storm, the dark masses
would fly across the sky, leaving the veil brighter and the
rain heavier than a good Scotch mist. . . . The
streets were then running “bankers high,” and the
driving rain to pedestrians defied their escape from its
moistening influences unless safe within the shelter of
closed doors.
The Herald would seem to have good reason for
its practice of discountenancing “descriptive”
reporting, if all its young men are liable to go
upon such wild bursts of incoherent English.
An anti-Federal meeting was held the
other day at Marrickville (Sydney), to roar prin-
cipally about the clause providing that the capital
should not be within 100 miles of Sydney, “ under
which Sydney was declared a politically-infected
spot.” When the provincial push first demanded
that the capital should be in N.S.W., and, there-
fore, not within 160 miles of Adelaide or Mel-
bourne, 400 of Hobart, or 1500 of Perth, it set the
germ rolling by declaring all these cities and all
the provinces attached politically-infected spots.
And after declaring 2,650,000 square miles of the
other people’s territory infected, how these fair-
minded and gentlemanly persons do curse ab
having about 10,000 sq. miles of their own terri-
tory similarly quarantined !
The late French President, Faure, it is no
secret, was seized with his sudden fatal-illness in
(if he did not actually die in) a maison-de~joie.
This circumstance, trumpeted forth by some of
the less “respectable” Parisian papers, is thus
discreetly touched on by the S.M. Herald’s Paris
correspondent: —
His appearance of late showed signs of failing health.
I may add that he sought relaxation in doubtful quarters.
The true version of his dying moments can scarcely be
given, but it is known to his intimate friends. He was
quite sensible for at least two hours, and asked M. Le
Gall, his private secretary, to send for a priest. To-mor-
row's religious obsequies are, therefore, quite logical, and
they will be very imposing. I have just returned from
Notre Dame, where the preparations are nearly com-
pleted. The vast Cathedral is draped in black and silver
from the door to the sanctuary. Two thrones are erected
on each side of the altar at which Napoleon I. was crowned
by Pius VII., and where so many official ceremonies have
taken place. The Archbishop of Paris will face the Papal
Nuncio, and a batch of French bishops in dazzling white
mitres will be in the stalls. The Ambassadors and repre-
sentatives of the Courts of Europe will occupy the first
row of seats. The Czar’s brilliant mission will surround
the new President of the Republic, and Her Majesty has
sent the Earl of Pembroke and Montgomery, Lord Steward
of the Household, with a special autograph letter to Mine.
Felix Faure, and a gorgeous wreath from the villa where
she will stay next month. The funeral will cost 150,000 fr.
The lying-in-state at the Elys6e is drawing tens of thou-

Cardinal Moran, when he authorised that grand
function at St. Mary’s, Sydney, probably “ didn’t
know it was loaded. ”
Thus ex.-N.S.W. Gov. Carrington :
My landed estates (on which I am entirely dependent
for a livelihood, having no source of income whatever
save from lai. I) consist of 100 farms, 62 over and 67
under 200 acres each ; and 262 oottasres, all with gardens,
of which most are let at Is. a week and under, some going
up to Is. Bd. a week ; 1400 allotments near YVycomhe, and
1000 village allotments in Bucks and in Lincolnshire, let
at from Bs. to 30s. an acre, the landlord paying all rates,
taxes, and outgoings.


Do you want
Consumption ?
We are sure you do not. Nobody wants
it. But it comes to many thousands every
year. It comes to those who have had
coughs and colds until the throat is raw, and
the lining membrane of the lungs is in-
flamed. Stop your cough when it first ap-
pears, and you remove the great danger of
future trouble.
AYER’S
Cherry Pectoral
stops coughs of all kinds. It does so because
it is a soothing and healing remedy of great
power. This makes it the greatest preven-
tive to consumption. It is not a question of
many bottles and large doses. A few drops
will often make a complete cure. Don’t neg-
lect your cough: you cannot afford to run the
risk. Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral will soothe your
raw throat and quiet your inflamed lungs.
Beware of cheap imitations. See that the name
Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral, is blown in the glass of
each bottle. Put up in large and small bottles.

THE ILLUSTRATED LONDON NEWS of
Sept. 28, 1895, says:
“ If I were asked which single medicine I should
prefer to take abroad with me, as likely to be
most generally useful, to the exclusion of all
others, I should say Chlorodyne. I never travel
without it, and its general applicability to the
relief of a large number of simple ailments forms
its best recommendation.”
“Hermes”: I was in the Maoriland rail-
way service once, and the Rakaia smash wakes up
recollections of the old happy-go-lucky days when
the M.L. railways were run oh principles that
were mostly incompetence, chaos and beer. OnCe
an engine left Burnside with 19 trucks and a
guard’s van for Caversham, and just as the engine
reached the top of the hill between the two stations
the couplings between the engine and the hist
truck broke, and the 19 trucks and guard s van
dashed back down hill towards Burnside, ihe
guard rushed to put on the brake, but his assistant
promptly knocked him down and sat. on him till
the train reached the bottom of the hill. Had he
put the brake on, in all probability the van would
have left the rails and killed them both. Ihe
guard, firmly believing that his mate’s brain had
turned, lay quiet in the hope that the show might
stop before the lunatic started to “ play up.
Writer saw guard two days after, and
his hair was still standing and plentifully
sprinkled with gray. Solemn fact! . . .
Another thrilling episode struck me at Milton.
The 10.45 a.m. was just about due, and I called
up Millburn, the next station, and asked him if
she had left. A torrent of blasphemy came
through the telephone, and when my staggered
senses had come back to me I was told that the
blanky driver had, in a moment of abstraction,
started off for Milton, after shunting a truck into
the siding, and left his train standing at the plat-
form. Went outside just as the engine sailed into
the station, stepped on to the footplate, and asked
the driver where his train was. The man looked
round, and when he saw the naked rails behind
him gaped in blank astonishment, and then asked
the fireman where the train was. And the flab-
bergasted fireman gaped back at him and gasped
out that he was somethinged if he knew. This
wasn’t exactly quite a common occurrence, but still
it wasn’t so astonishing, according to the old M.L.
methods, as one might think. In the old days, before
the progressive management of Maxwell had in-
troduced steam brakes, it was common for trains
to bolt down the steep inclines that are so frequent
in Maoriland. One greasy day, a train bolted
down Bushy Grade, just outside Palmerston
South, and the guard, turning to his terrified
brakeman, remarked, “ I hae me doots if she’ll
get tae tha bootom aall richt.” Then, raising his
eyes to the van-ceiling, “ Forgie us if what we dae
be nae pleasin’ in Thy sight.” And then he
calmly unhooked the side-chains, knocked out the
draw-bolt, thereby severing the van from the
train, and, by means of his brakes, soon brought
the van to a standstill. The train rushed on and
got through safely, and, when the guard was asked
to explain, he swore that the bolt broke, and that
he had neglected to fasten his side-chains before
leaving the terminal station. He was fined 10s.
for not having his side-chains fastened, and the
thing was forgotten till the brakeman told his best
girl the facts of the case. His best girl threw him
over by-and-bye, as best girls will do, and married
the fireman of the same train, to whom she told
the truth of the matter. The brakeman owned
up, and shortly afterwards there was a vacancy.

Matthews a fair run for Lyell (Tas.) Assembly

vigorous A.M.A. official, and a willing barracker
for West Coast importance. But his two oppo-
nents, wobbly mediocrities with a “ property ”
following 1 , have the best of the contest, inasmuch
as of 2000 miners on the field only about 400 per-
sons are entitled to vote ! The ’97 rolls are to be
used ; of 800 persons whose names are on that
out-of-date affair, nearly 400 have since left the
district. So unless the 2000 miners chain the fat-
men to a stump on polling-day, the Labor man has
Buckley’s chance.

W. H. Mat,yon, Esq., Man. Chemist, Ballarat.
Dear Sir, —For years past (about ten), I have been
troubled with “ Acne ” in its worst form, and have sought
advice from the best Australian and London doctors, with
only fair results. A Victorian friend of mine, some four
or five weeks ago, sent me a tin of your “ Ligmolliene,”
and speaking very highly of its wonderful curative powers.
I naturally took same “ Cum Grano Salis,” and was in-
clined not to use it ; eventually I tried your ointment
with truly marvellous results, and am now entirely cured ;
and think people who suffer from skin diseases are greatly
indebted to you for your wonderful remedy. I shall
advise all my friends with skin troubles to use same.
Wishing “ Ligomolliene ” all the success it richly deserves,
Yours faithfully, GEORGE J. O’REGAN.

some years under the prescription of Professor M'Call
Anderson and other eminent dermatologists, with only
partial and temporary relief. When I met you I com-
menced somewhat sceptically your ointment Ligmolliene,
and after about two months’ treatment I may honestly say
my enemy is defeated, and I am perfectly well. I will only
add that since I commenced the treatment of myself I have
prescribed it to others, and am still doing so with brilliant
results. Please accept my hearty thanks, and remain yours

Kalgoorlie, September 12, 1898.
To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir.—l feel it my duty to write and tell you how
your remedies have cured me.
I suffered great agony with WEAK NERVES and
RHEUMATICS, and I sent for some Of your ALFALINE
REMEDIES, which completely cured me, and I have felt
as well as I could wish, although it is two years ago.
I also tried your ALFALINE UNIVERSAL PILLS,
which completely cleared my skin and purified my blood,
and I am now using your ALFALINE HAIR RESTORER,
which has thoroughly cleaned the scalp and made the
hair grow again, and it has gradually turned the hair
from being grey to that of its original color. I have also
recommended your Remedies for a number of different
complaints and I have never known them to fail, but to
do all that was claimed for them. I have great pleasure
to recommend these remedies to all sufferers, as I know
they can be depended on.
You are at liberty to publish this as well as my photo.
Yours truly, C. J. A. NIELSEN.

Rescued from Nervous Suffering.

Mr. THOMAS MUDIMAN,
The well-known Tailor, of 327 Elizabeth-street, Sydney,
states, on oath, how his shattered nervous system was
completely cured and restored.
Statutory
im
Declaration.
I, THOS. MUDIMAN, Master Tailor, of 327 Elizabeth-
street, Sydney, in the Colony of New South Wales, do
hereby solemnly and sincerely declare as follows: —
Whereas I suffered severely from a very troublesome
affection of the NERVES, which affected me so much that.
I was quite unable to attend to my business. I tried
several doctors and many remedies, but all of no avail.
Whereas I, as a last hope, obtained some of Herr Rass-
mussen’s Purely Herbal ALFALINE VITALITY PILLS,
which I hereby solemnly and sincerely declare COM-
PLETELY CURED ME within a few weeks, and although,
this is over five years ago I have remained well ever since.
The ALFALINE PILLS also cured my wife, and I make
this solemn declaration conscientiously believing the same-
to be true.
Declared at Sydney this 29th day of April, 1898.
THOMAS MUDIMAN.

Says Cooktown Independent apropos Cook
election:
“ Hamilton is a man, and vve won’t vote against him,
but damn his politics,’’ was frequently heard at the poll-
ing-booths last Saturday.
Which about sums-up the case of genial Jack, the
white man who fights with Boodlewraith on be-
half of the black man.
The offer for military service in Samoa of
M.L. volunteers recalls the gimcrack jingoism
which Julius Yogel sought to introduce into
Maoriland politics as a means of rehabilitating
himself in the good graces of the Maorilanders,
15 years ago. Vogel preached the doctrine that
his province should be the suzerain state of all
the Pacific islands, and would have dearly liked
to get his fat forefinger into the Samoan pie. The
establishment of the protectorate over Raratonga
under F. J. Moss was the sole fruit of the
“Pacific policy,” over which the masterful trea-
surer had so dramatically spread-eagled himself
On one occasion, an Auckland Star reporter
interviewed Vogel at Waiwera —the hot springs
near Kawau —when Vogel unrolled quite a
Rhodesian scheme of annexation. The reporter,
satisfied that he had “ a sensation ” in his notes,
proceeded to transcribe in a quiet room in the
hotel. In about ten minutes Vogel’s orderly
sought out thp pressman, and said : “ Sir Julius s
compliments, and he will feel obliged if you will
refrain from referrin’g to the New Hebrides.” The
reporter sulkily promised to excise the reference —
one of the plums of the interview. A feyv hours
later Vogel sent requesting another excision, but
by this time the pressman was hastening with his
“ copy ” to the city, anxious to get his prize into
cold type. When he reached the office he found
that Vogel had wired to the editor, cautioning
him not to use a single line of the interview until
he had seen it. “ Wire it to me —collect 1” said
the telegram. And so the 5000-word interview
was telegraphed back to Vogel at Govt, expense,
to be bov/dlerised before publication.

Baron Berzelius’ Report.
These Bitters I recommend in DYSPEPSIA, CHRONIC RHEUMATISM and CUTA-
NEOUS AFFECTIONS. The action of Buchu on the human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of the Kidney and Bladder than any other herbal plant; and it also assists persons suffer-
ing from Skin Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and inducing perspiration.
Bead What Medical Men Say About Them,
BJERKIN, M.D. : —The Bitter is pure, and not like others in overdoses. It has a remark-
able influence on the Liver, promoting the secretions of Bile, and correcting it when deranged,
and restores healthy evacuations in cases of habitual costiveness.
D. ECKSTROM, M.D. : —BBBB—I find these Bitters a most valuable and wholesome
Tonic, being pure and strengthening ; a stimulant to the Liver, assisting Digestion. I therefore
thus recommend them.
GL B. WOOD, M.D. : —lt is the purest of Bitters, and exerts a peculiar influence over the
Liver. „, . .

COUGHS, COLDS on the CHEST,
BRONCHITIS & ASTHMA
Kapidly Cured by j
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its
wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of bron-
chitis, distressing cough, difficulty in breathing, hoarse-
ness, pain or soreness in the chest, experience delightful
and immediate relief, and to those who are subject to
colds on the chest it is invaluable, as it effects a complete
cure. It is most comforting in allaying tickling and irri-
tation in the throat, and giving strength to the voice, and
it never allows a cough or asthma to become chronic. No
house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a
dose is generally sufficient, and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G.. iIEARNE. Dear Sir, —I had a bad attack
of Bronchitis for six months, with dreadful hacking cough
day and night and great quantity of phlegm. Night
sweats came on and pains in my chest, and I got so weak
that I could not leave my bed. At this stage I was pro-
nounced to be in consumption. I had a lot of medicines
of different kinds, hut nothing did me any good until,
reading in the Age of your ‘ Bronchitis Cure,’ I got a
bottle, and after taking two doses I was much improved.
After taking two bottles the cough and night sweats left
me, my appetite returned, and I was able to get up ; and
am now in good health, for which I am truly grateful, and
shall recommend your Medicine to all my friends.—Yours
truly, E. SMITH, Halpin Park, Nhill, Victoria.”
“ After suffering from asthma until I was 17 years old,
and having been under a great many different treatments,
without benefit. I was induced to try Hearne’s Medicine
for Asthma. After taking three bottles of this medicine,
I quite got rid of the Asthma, and since then, which was
in the beginning of 1883,14 years ago, I have not had the
slightest return of it. The Medicine quite cure me, and
I have much pleasure in recommending it. —ALEX. J.
ANDERSON, Geelong, Victoria,”

With an ordinary tape measure determine the width
round the joints AA, round the instep 88, round heel CO,
round the ankle DD ; next ascertain the length and width
of tread by placing the foot on a sheet of paper, and
running a lead pencil round the heel and toes. Cut the
outline thus made with a scissors, and enclose with the
other measurements, stating what size you generally take,
what are your peculiarities—a weak ankle, perhaps a pet
corn, ingrowing nails, or a blooming bunion. All these
little matters attended to. If you have a long thin foot, or
a short thick one, with very high instep, send to ELLIS’S,
where you are sure to get a fit. The proprietor, with a

Mr. A. ST. CLAIR.
(specially reported.) " r ‘
Some interesting details concerning the
case of A. St. Clair, Esq., having been
furnished to us, we despatched our reporter
to Byron-street, Guildford, near Sydney,
where Mr. St. Clair resides and carries on
business as a photographer. Our reporter
explained his mission to Mr. St. Clair, and
that gentleman consented to afford the
desired interview.
“Then will you kindly furnish me with
particulars as to the initiation of your
malady ?”
“lam convinced,” replied Mr. St. Clair,
“ that it originated in there.” Our reporter
followed with his eyes the finger of the
photographer, which was directed to the
half-open door of a dark room. “Yes,”
continued Mr. St. Clair, “I worked a great
deal in there, and I believe my system was
first
Thrown Out of Gear
through my getting poisoned by some of the
chemicals which we in the trade are obliged
to make use of. I began to feel sick and
faint, and my head was
Racked with Fearful Pains.
I couldn’t sit down to my food, and all I
was able to eat was a mouthful or so between
meals, which did me no good, for I started
retching and vomiting immediately after-
wards. Pains seized me all over, principally
in the back, and as a blue line distinctly
appeared around my gums, the doctor whom
I consulted said this was a positive
Sign of Lead Poisoning.”
** Did you take nothing to allay the
violence of these symptoms?”
“Yes, many medicines ; but got not the
least benefit, and the more physic I took the
worse I got. I was now attacked with that
most terrible complaint—insomnia. Sleep-
less I passed night after night wearily toss-
ing to and fro, and I seemed as though I
should never have natural sleep again. I
was completely worn out, and my nerves
were shattered. I was not yet confined to
my bed, but I daren’t go out.
I was Frightened.
I can’t tell you of what. A vague terror of
something dreadful about to happen hung
over me. Strange feelings, as though I was
going to fall forward on my face, came over
me. When I woke in the morning I felt
choked and suffocated, and I should lump
out of bed only to find myself
Too Giddy to Stand.
Every doctor I went to said that my nervous
system was completely broken up. But all
the same their physic did me no good. I
was miserable, unhappy, melancholy, and
so nervous that I couldn’t stand the least
•annoyance. I heard that I could get some
Special Treatment in
Melbourne,
which would effect a cure, so I went there
with renewed hope. ”
“ Were your expectations realised ?”
“ Not much ; for I derived no benefit from
the treatment I obtained, nor were the
doctors
At the Hospital
there able to afford me any relief, and I was
forced to take the long painful journey
home again, and arrived just as ill as when
I started.
“ Did you try any special remedies?”
“Yes, I used many, but they were one
and all alike—they had absolutely no effect
upon me, and I got into a complete state of
nervous collapse. I had
Fallen Away Terribly
in weight, and was of a ghastly colour. I
was laid up in bed unable to move, and had
to be taken to the doctor’s in a cart. I
thought I was going to die. In fact, I made
sure I was gone. Then a friend mentioned
the virtues of Clements Tonic to me and
told me it was a
Perfect Nerve Remedy.
I answered that I didn’t think there existed
a medicine efficacious enough to drag me
out of the terrible state of nervous prostra-
tion and general debility I had reached. My
friend, however, persisted, and I at last
gave Clements Tonic a trial, and I shall be
thankful as long as I live, for that remedy
saved my life. Without Clements Tonic r
should now be
A Dead Man.
It commenced to act beneficially from the
moment that I started to take it. I felt
more restful, and didn’t tremble so much,
and the insomnia began to give way. The
gloom was removed from my spirits and at
intervals I now slept deeply. As I con-
tinued with Clement* Tonic, so did my
condition improve. Once more I could eat
without retching and vomiting up my food.
I obtained more and more sleep, and a better
appetite every day. My sudden improve-
ment was a
Revelation to My Friends.
When I was able to get about again I found
all that nervous, tremorous feeling had dis-
appeared, and I soon put on weight, and it
was not long before I was as well as ever.
Of course, I took Clements Tonic regularly
until I was assured of
A Permanent Recovery.’*
“ And you are entirely cured now, Mr-
St. Clair ?”
“ Yes ; I am as sound as a bell and ready
to travel anywhere that is necessary in
pursuit of business.”
“ And your recovery and present healthy
state you ascribe to Clements Tonic solely ?”
“I do most unreservedly. As I said
before, it saved me, pulled me back, as it
were, from the
Very Verge of the Grave
after all the other medicines, doctors, and
hospital had signally failed. I shall be for
ever grateful.”
STATUTORY DECLARATION.
I, Albert Thomas St. Clair, of Byron-street, Guild-
ford, in the Colony of New South Wales, do
solemnly and sincerely declare that I have carefully
read the annexed document, consisting of eight folios
and consecutively numbered from one to eight, and
that it contains and is a true and faithful account of
my illness and cure by Clements Tonic, and also
contains my full permission to publish the same in
any way ; and I make this solemn declaration con-
scientiously believing the same to be true, and by
virtue of the provisions of an Act made and passed m
the ninth year of the reign of her present Majesty,
intituled “An Act for the more effectual abolition of
Oaths and Affirmations taken and made in the various
Departments of the Government of New South Wales,
and to substitute Declarations in lieu thereof, and for
the suppression of voluntary and extra-judicial Oaths
and Affidavits.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was not iny fault that I did not marry Desir&e.
It was Jack’s fault, for he had married her be ore
I met her. So that even the most censorious cou c
not hold me to blame. Having married her, >e
took, her away to his run on the sea-coast a
lonely place, 50 miles from everywhere. There
were herds of cattle and flocks of sheep, but no
human beings ; so after two years of that awful
solitude she needed a change and came to town.
I called her Desiree because she was essentially
the Desirable One. She was perfection, from the
slender foot that felt to your clasp through its
silken slipper like some flexible and delicate gloved
hand, to the topmost curl that escaped from the
wreathed masses of her dark-brown hair. In those
long, empty afternoons of her married life she had
gazed out so many hours over the barren sea that
her blue eyes had caught the tone of its unfathom-
able depths, veiled now and then by shadows of
mysterious passing clouds. I was always fond of
sea pictures, so I pursued my studies of marine
art in Desiree’s eyes.
I, too, had come down for a change. I had
worked hard and felt the need of rest, yet here
was a new task for me to take up. Jack’s wife
had to be taken care of, and as he was not there
to do it, the duty evidently belonged to some
devoted person. It was true that I did not know
Jack—had never even seen him, but what of that?
Shall we never act except at the selfish biddings
of mere personal friendship ? I hope that we have
better moral guides than that, and I, who have
ever been a slave to conscience, here saw my path
of duty plain before me.
Desiree and I soon made friends and became
Absorbed (it is the only word) in the work of
studying and understanding each other. Know-
ing, however, that a heartless world, bound in the
trammels of a cold artificiality, looks with dis-
favor upon Uncertificated Absorption, I proposed
to Desir&e that we should escape for a little time
from the observant eyes of Society and fly to
Nature. “Nature,” as I pointed out to her,
“ keeps ever a fine soul of freshness and inno-
cence. Let us take our own fresh and innocent
souls to her, and feel the sympathy of the Great
Mother applauding and blessing us.” Desiree
approved, so we went together for a day in the
country.
Nature aid all for us that I had felt sure she
would ; in such a case one can make sure of
Nature. I cannot reveal the full account of that
day of days, for it is hazy with happiness, but it
is marked by two main reminiscences, of which one
is general and one particular. The general is that
it was a “Symphony in Azure,” for it was per-
vaded by the blue of the heavens above and the
blue of Desiree’s eyes beneath. The particular is
that I learned the way to eat blackberries.
Perhaps you, dear reader, think that you know
how to eat blackberries. I thought so too, and,
indeed, early in that day ate some myself—gross
berries, gathered with common hands, and put
into an earthly mouth. Listen, and I will tell you
how perfectly to eat them —even as I was taught.
Go to the edge of the birch forest where it looks
down upon the pleasant fields, when outside the
mid-day summer sun is warm, and there is no
sound but the drowsy hum of bees. There throw
yourself down on a cushion of the dry, < u «t‘ L ..
fallen leaves. Then let the Delightful One
wander away for a moment until she has
gathered a handful of the ripe berries and seated
herself near you. At your length reclining, yon
lay your cheek in the soft lap, warm from the
outer sunshine and from her own dear self. Then
will she approach the cup of her fair hand to your
lips, straightening the finger-tips that the berries
may lie flat along them. With a finger of the
other hand will she move each berry on, and, as it
comes to your desiring lips, you leave a kiss in
thanks, and await the next. When the last is
gone you reverently kiss once more the sweet-
stained fingers that have fed you with angels
food, and—the Divine Repast is over.
Folly? No, indeed. What better shall we ever
have offered us in a world of fools? Go to, good
Signor Greybeard, I am not taking any of your
kind of wisdom just now.
But Jack ! Jack !—what did I not endure that
day for duty’s sake and yours !
Maoriland.
EDWARD TREGEAR.
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman (he’s
Scoatch, ye ken), who has just succeeded to the
leadership of the “ Great Liberal ” party in the
Commons, is in his 63rd year. His father, oir
James Campbell, was a big draper in Glasgow,
and before he entered politics Henry worked in
the —er —emporium in Glasgow. He got the
hyphen and the Bannerman together with a fat
fortune from his maternal uncle, who was a
draper in Kent.
The other day, at Campbell Creek
Gold Dredging Co.’s works, near Castlemaine,
the man at the hydrant turned the jet on a boulder
which behaved as no other rock in his experience
had done—it changed into billows of lather. And
when the Old Inhabitant came he remembered
that a flood—“the fatal flood,” he called it—of
New Year’s Day, 1889, had swept through the
Winter’s Flat soap-works arid washed down a ton
or two of soap. This block, weighing nearly
scwt., had become embedded in debris, and so had
been preserved for a decade.
That celebrated litigant, W. R. .Merry,
lately became bankrupt at Melbourne. Liabilities
sworn at £2207 95., assets at ,£428,090 4s. 9d. But
the latter only exist on paper—like Treas. Reid’s
surpluses. Among other items occur these:
“ Balance on contract for construction of Geelong
and Ballarat railway, £264,590 4s. 9d.,” and
“due under decree of Privy Council in action,
Merry v. Queen, £140,000 also half of £25,000
advanced by Evans and Merry to a Melb. firm for
purposes of litigation against Queen and Board of
Land and Works.” Insolvent sets down his house-
hold expenses for the last two years at 10s. per
week, and his house-rent at ss. per month, winch,
for a man whose assets total nearly half-a-million,
is distinctly moderate. Poor Merry’s troubles
seem to have been mostly caused by going to law
early and often, and keeping at it steadily ; and,
as his first action in the Hereafter will probably
be to issue a caveat claiming a prior right and
title in that lot or messuage known as Seat 1, Row
A, it is to be hoped legal expenses “ up above
are on a lower scale than hereabouts, or this m-
solvent will be in danger of losing by foreclosure
his wings, harp, and halo.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Probably no Australian Governor was ever
placed in a more embarrassed position than Lord
Lamington on a recent tour on the Burnett. At
one spot he was presented with an address by the
chairman of a Divisional Board. This magnate
was accompanied by a band of wild bushmen,
their trousers full of spear-grass and dead gum-
leaves in their beards. The address was read in
the open air. The chairman took off his hat,
placed it reverently on the ground behind him,
hauled his address from an inside coat-pocket,
and proceeded to read it in a voice that left the
listener in doubt if he was chiefly influenced by
reverence or fright. The Governor’s only com-
panion was a small, favorite dog known as “ Jor-
rocks.” This intelligent animal, being highly-
connected and accustomed to all the usages and
privileges of polite society, regarded the chair-
man’s act of placing the hat on the ground as an
act of courtesy to himself, and a pleasing proof of
the perfect sanitary arrangements of the local
Divisional Board. So Jorrocks bowed to the
chairman, and strolled over to the hat, where he
executed a graceful flank movement common in
dog society, and did it with a precision and com-
pleteness rarely attained by common dogs. Every
bushman present owned a dog of some species,
“ mongrel, puppy, whelp and hound, or curs of low
degree,” and this motley canine crew proceeded to
follow the example of Jorrocks, and started for
the chairman’s hat. The Governor was a witness
of this thrilling spectacular drama, and when the
27th dog had completed the hat act, His Ex. was
nearly too weak to stand erect without holding on
to something for support. When at last the
chairman took up his hat and placed it on his
head ! the Governor prayed fervently to be in a
lodge in some vast wilderness, some boundless
contiguity of shade, where his too oppressed soul
could be relieved by one demoniac yell.

The death of the late Dr. Hancock recalls
a Queensland Club incident of the night Groom
was elected Speaker. After the election, old
Billy Miles walked over to the club and found the
doctor, with his left hand beneath his coat-tail
and his right pawing the air, fiercely disclaiming
against the Govt, for “ this scandalous business,
sir!” “Do you mean to make any reflection on
me or the Ministry ? ” said old Miles, with a war-
like, Caledonian glance in his eye. “Ido ! ” said
the doctor with great emphasis. “ Then come
outside,” said old Billy as he proceeded to remove
his coat. The attitude of both was entirely new
to scientific boxers. The doctor ducked his head
and shot out his right as if he were poking bread
into a hot oven, and Miles brought his left round
with a swipe as if he were brushing cockroaches
off a shelf. But this swipe caught the doctor on
the ear and laid him out. As he rose he glared at
his opponent and hissed melodramatically—“ By
heaven, sir, I have killed men for far less than
that! ” To which the ancient squatter sarcastically
observed, “I’ll be d—- if ever you’ll kill me,
for I’m not fool enough to take any of your
physio ! ” After which there was a fine icebergian
coolness between these warriors for many a day.
Peace to both the kindly-hearted old pioneers !

When “ Majah ” Lyons was recently in
the old country as immigration-lecturer,, he had
among his lantern-slides a reproduction of that
Bulletin picture of “people who goon the land,”
where the “ farmer ” and his wife think of starting
to feed a clutch of chickens for fear the hen has
not enough milk for them. He tells me that this
picture always sent an Irish audience into boister-
ous laughter. He tried it once on a Scotch crowd,
who gazed at it as seriously as if it had been
a picture of the Crucifixion. Next day a solemn
Caledonian advised him not to use that slide again,
as it looked like “ freevolous tretment o’ a serrious
subjec’ ” !

An English firm has written to me asking
at what price large quantities of the seed-
cones of the bunya-trees could be shipped from
Brisbane. This beautiful tree (Araucaria
Bidivilli) is indigenous to the Bunya Ranges,
in S. Queensland. The tree attains a diameter of
seven or eight feet with a bark up to twelve
inches in thickness. The cones weigh up to 8
and 10 lbs., and one of them falling from a tall
tree would kill a bullock. The nuts in the cone
are highly nutritious, either raw or roasted. The
first cones exported were sent to London in 1849
and brought 10 guineas each in Covent Garden
market. The tree bears annually, but the full crop
is only triennial. In the old days, blacks came
from distances up to 300 miles for the “ Feast of
Bunyas,” and were the guests of the tribes owning
the range. Leichhardt, in 1845, mentions seeing
the bunya on the Isaacs River, but that was a
mistake. After the bunya season, the blacks
sometimes kept the cones for months by placing
them in water. The smell of these steeped cones
would have knocked out Limburger cheese in one
round.

Ex-Governor Bowen’s death recalls his
trip in the Pioneer to Cape York and Somerset in
1862 ; also his flowery description of the scenery.
“ The general aspect of the coast along which we
sailed for nearly 2000 miles resembled that of
southern Italy and Greece. The mountain ranges
of N.Q. have much of the picturesque outline and
rich coloring of the Apennines in Calabria, and of
the hills of Euboea and the Peloponnesus, while
the island groups recalled the isles of the JE gean
and lonian seas.” I have a copy of Bowen’s
“ Ithaca in 1850,” a small book of 70 pp., dedi-
cated to Gladstone, and containing a brief but
eloquent description of the noble defence of Mis-
solonghi in 1822 by a handful of Greeks under
Mavrocordatus, who defied a whole Turkish army
under Reshid Mehemet Pasha. There is nothing
more heroic in the annals of warfare.

If Dr. William Macgregor has accepted the
Governorship of Lagos, we may be certain it was
because he was offered nothing better, or possibly
nothing else at all. And if this man, with his 23
years of Australasian service, and 11 years’ hard
work (with his life in his hands) among fever and
savages in Papua, exiled from wife and children,
is sent to a West African Gehenna like Lagos,
with still worse exile from his family, then the
fact displays on the part of the Imperial Govern-
ment a black ingratitude that must be an eternal
disgrace to all concerned in the responsibility.

Editor Sanders, of Australian Star, in
reply to Wise, Q.C., in the Hutchinson libel-case,
stated, believing he was compelled to do so, that
the Star circulation was 36,000 daily. But there
seems to be no compulsion on a newspaper to
state its circulation when defending a libel-action.
Parnell, in his action against London Times, ob-
tained a Judge’s order to force the Times’ hand in
this respect, but the order was quashed on appeal,
the decision of the court being that the ends of
justice would be met by the defending newspaper
admitting that its circulation was a large one.
This the Times did.

Excruciating
Neuralgia Cured.
Capt. Agnes H. Amos is the chief
of the Salvation Army in South-
port, a township 50 miles from Bris-
bane. Her good works are many,
and there is little doubt her over-
exertions in the cause she has at
heart induced general ill-health and
anaemia, which resulted in acute
neuralgia. She tried many reme-
dies without avail, including hot-
water cloths wrapped round her
face. Once—for eight long weeks—
-56 days—she was rendered almost
entirely sleepless by the acuteness
of the shooting, burning pains in her
face. A galvanic battery did not
cure her, but Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills did. Two boxes quite relieved
her—the relief commencing before
she had finished the first box. Ulti-
mately the pains entirely ceased,
she could sleep well, exhausted
nature was recuperated, her form
became plumper, her eyes brighter,
her cheeks rosy, and her whole
nature energetic and vivacious fust
as it had been before her illness.
No matter how acute, Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills conquer nearly all cases
■of neuralgia, even when everything
■else has failed.
His Lights Are Out.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Have I hung my cap on the main truck, lass, or
stood on the royal yard,
That you clutch my arm at a deck-wide cliff with
a motherly damned regard ? . . .
It’s little they reck of the way it hurts when they
think of being kind,
But there isn’t a rock as sharp down there as the
knife that sent me blind.
Aye, a sotted fool and his dirty lance, and a twice
his thousand pound
Won’t pay for the ship that was half my soul— her
keel on the outward bound.
Blind ! Blind, oh, my God, as a crawling mole !
and never again to see, —
A star in the sky of the meanest thief, but a
starless Night for me. . . •
They’re breaking a bit on the reef to-day. It blew
half a gale last night,
And I laid and listened and fell asleep,—to dream
again of the light,
Till I heard the wind in her cordage chime. Oh,
she was my Queen of May,
And I dressed her up in her Sunday clothes, and
laughed when she waltzed away.
How I paced the poop like a desert chief and felt
the splash of the foam,
As she took the road like an Arab mare when I
turned her head for home !
I woke in the dark. And my face was wet —it s
hardly a sick man’s fault,
When he tastes the cup of his bitterness, if he
finds that tears are salt.
Great Lord of Hosts, how they ca’l down there !
Just hark how the young ones sing,
And tumble and roll away to the beach to play at
kiss-in-the-ring !
Kind Lord of Hosts ! how yon sun must shine, and
glitter the heaven through,
And dance and blaze in a shower of gold out there
on the white and blue.
They are cracking it on up-coast, I’ll bet. ’Tis a
rattling tops’! breeze ;
lean see the gloss of their wetted sides, a’wash
with the clinging seas ;
I can catch the gleam of the Baltic pine with the
caulking lines between ;
And I know the rig of the yards of Tyne from the
build of Aberdeen.
How the smell of it sets my heart to beat! There’s
never a garden rose
With a scent like that from the salt sou’-east,
when a ten-knot monsoon blows ;
Oh, it brings things back in the Dark to me—the
dreams of the crippled dog—
Till I hear the grunt of the rudder chains, the
running out of the log ;
Till I hear the churn of the bow-cut waves; the
kiss of her cuddling dip ;
’Till I’m live and whole and a king again on the
deck of my bonny ship.
Yes, I’m whole and live and I’m free to strive to
pleasure me as I can—•
So haul away on vour halliards there ! and follow
your chantey man!
I have laid her out for the brave west wind to
battle the Horn around ;
I have laid her up on the Channel course, and I’ll
home her safe and sound.
For its north of Scilly the soundings shoal—a
bottom of ooze and mud —
And the water’s deep on the coast of France, with
a sand as red as blood.
Aye, I know the lay of the Seven Stones; I’ll
steer by the lights in line;
Where the devil has set his traps for ships—the
devil must wait for mine.
We have lost the fog at the Farallones, and carried
her by the chart;
We have left the fog at the Farallones, but we’ll
find it at the Start.
’Tis book and beacon, and beacon and book, and
never forget the lead !
And beware Scar Rock with anor’-east wind when
the Whitby light turns red !
So a double reef in your topsails, lads ! There’s
hardly a ’prentice fool
But knows o’ the flood in Hasborough Gat, and
the lights at Hartlepool.
And I’ll steer my ship by the laws of God, as His
wind or tide allows ;
By the rules of the Merchant Shipping Act, and
the rules of Trinity House.
She will take her berth in the London Docks, and
add her load to the loads,
Though I stood at the wheel with Beelzebub,
from the Downs to Margate Roads.
If I moon out here on the cliffs and think, my
face to the open sea,
’Tis only because of the things I love that throng
in the Dark to me.
’Tis only because of a world I knew ; a world that
was wholly mine ;
It had three parts water and one part land, and
plenty of teak and pine.
It had three parts water and one part land, and a
Sun to light them o’er,
And the Sun and the Land and the Brave Deep
Seas —I shall see them nevermore ;
It had three parts water and one part land, and
plenty of hemp and oak ;
With Four Main Roads for the feet of Trade, and
a crossing at Cape St. Roque.
The water's blue in the Indian Seas and salt in
the Great Gulf Stream,
And the little trade clouds they are fair to see,
with the steady Trades abeam ;
And the moonheads shine in the tropic nights
when the sea-fire’s at the bow ;
And the Cross hangs high in the Southern arch —
but it doesn’t matter now.
I will never rest in a vault ashore, I couldn’t sleep
in a hole;
They must take me out in a clipper ship and leave
me under the roll;
They must lay me down at the Crossing-place, in
the mid Atlantic sea,
And I’ll say “Good-night” to the Voices then,
and the Night will sleep with me.

Melb. Leader cribs from Lippincott and

Drought.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dawn, and even now, in its birth, is the daylight
hard and sere as though already old. No lapping
water to usher in the early morn as it should be
ushered, no song of birds, not even the chirp of a
careless cricket. All is still, deadly still, without
sound or stir; only the light creeps slowly over the
dusty sky, hardening as it grows, till the soft,
timid stars fade away as though ashamed of their
delicate beauty.
As the light spreads and expands we see far and
near the skeleton frames of starving sheep moving
slowly through the dim shadows and desolation,
like weary ghosts of darkness marching before the
dawn, longing for the shelter of the night to hide
their misery. From far-off, somewhere in the
dark and gloomy scrub, comes the hopeless low of
a bullock. Men say that only man speaks ;
parsons assure us he is the only animal that prays.
Could they but hear the dull, hopeless low of the
cattle, with their heads uplifted to the brazen sky
as the dawn breaks over the dreariness of the
drought-stricken West, they would, perchance,
hear a greater and more touching appeal for
mercy than ever arose from church or cathedral.
And still no answer !
But the dawn is brief. Before we have time
to appreciate the full emotion of its misery, day is
upon us. The sun is up, burning with fierce eye
between the bare, straggling trees, and glaring
down hot and resistless over the scanty bushes
that seem to be suffering a perpetual struggle for
existence.
Slowly the sheep gather round a tank. At one
time they raced in, bucking and bleating. That
was when the drought was- young ; now they are
too weak and wasted to do more than is absolutely
necessary. Crawling down to the edge of the
water, they pass in around the carcases of their
dead comrades, and, with lowered heads and
bloodshot eyes, drink desperately and without
intermissiou till they can swallow no more. Turn-
ing wearily, they face the long expanse of dust
again, and wander away
in search of a stray
leaf here and there
fallen from the trees,
but some are too weak
even for this. Gorged
with water, they have
stuck in the edge of
the fast - drying tank.
They make one or two
weak efforts to free
themselves, then, if
Providence is not kind
enough to let them
smother themselves,
wait wearily for their
long torture and linger-
ing death.
Three or four kan-
garoos hop slowly out
of the scrub and ap-
proach the tank.
Avoiding the bogged
sheep, alive and dead,
they drop on to their
“hands” and crawl
down to the water. A
sheep plunges and
struggles to get out.
But the kangaroos are
no longer the quick,
springy athletes of bet-
ter times. With scarce
a look they begin to
drink. Suddenly comes
a sound of breaking
scrub. Jerking them-
selves upright, the kan-
garoos listen. Only
the cattle coming for
their morning drink.
The kangaroos finish
their drinking, and hop
away quietly into the
scrub at the back of
the tank. The cattle
drink, walk round slow-
ly and aimlessly, drink
again, and seem to be
wondering how they
will get through the
long, hot, dreary day
that is before them.
Another mob of sheep
comes in through a
cloud of dust. They
gather round and imi-
tate the performance of
the cattle. The sun
gets hotter. Gradually
the sheep and cattle
draw off to the shade
of a few miserable
trees and stand still,
wondering what to do
with themselves. A
few emus saunter lei-
surely across the plain
up to the tank, have
their drink, and join
the sheep and cattle.
They, too, seem to be
considering. Soon they
begin to amuse them-
selves by chasing the
sheep out of the shade.
Having cleared space
enough for their liking,
they settle down to
make themselves com-
fortable. Away in the
distance, two swagmen
are following the track
across the plain.
The crows begin to
gather. After a few
preliminary skirmishes,
one alights on the back
of a bogged sheep, and
makes quick, savage
pecks for its eyes, first
on one side, then on
the other. The sheep
throws its head about
wildly. At length it
begins to tire. The crow watches his opportu-
nity, and with a quick dab has one eye out. With
the slow, approving manner of a gourmet he swal-
lows it. Then he manoeuvres for the other eye.
A couple more join him. Between them they
soon get the remaining eye. Then they coolly set
to work to pick their way into the meat on the
back and ribs. The sheep struggles hopelessly,
throwing its eyeless head from side to side in vain
attempts to see its torturers. The crows keep
quietly on, pausing only now and then to settle a
dispute amongst themselves. The ants scent the
blood and arrive in swarms. Two long red and
black lines lead up and away from the suffering
sheep. Hungry they come, satiate they go.
Gradually the holes the crows are picking widen
and deepen till the vitals are reached. The
swarm of ants increases. The rest is indescribable.
Before midday a boundary-rider appears. The
emus sight him in the distance, get up, and with
many stoppages for inspection, stalk sedately
into the scrub. As the boundary-rider approaches
at the eternal jog the crows fly up into the
neighboring trees. Dropping the reins of his
horse, he walks down to the water to pull out the
bogged sheep. The crows croak harshly above
him. Cursing them, he goes on with his work. His
horse creeps down to the water’s edge, the bridle
reins dragging on the ground. The man is too busy
to notice him. After a few vain attempts to put a
sulky sheep on its legs he leaves it and goes on
with the rest. Here and there one struggles on to
its feet and staggers away ; now and then he cuts
another’s throat with his pocket-knife to put it
out of misery. When he is finished, his horse is
standing on the top of the tank. Without
noticing he goes up and takes hold of the reins.
An angry exclamation, and he drives his boot into
the horse’s ribs. The poor old horse hardly
moves. With a couple more kicks the boundary-
rider remounts, and at the everlasting jog dis-
appears in the heat and haze shimmering over the
plain.
The sun crosses the meridian. Nothing stirs.
Looking out across the plain, the whole earth
appears to be smoking and trembling with heat.
False lakes, mirroring imaginary trees and bushes,
appear and disappear. The scrub hangs dark,
dusty and motionless.
Gradually the wind arises from the west, swel-
tering along slowly and lazily, scorching the face,
and especially the eyelids, till they ache with the
heat. Little by little it grows stronger. The
dust begins to rise.
The sun droops towards the horizon, but as yet
there is no perceptible difference in the tempera-
ture. The stock begin to come in to water again.
Down in the west a storm is gathering. The wind
increases, the dust rises thicker and more blind-
ing. At the tank the scenes of the morning are
repeated, only now the iguanas, most cruel of all,
have come to help the crows and ants.
Slowly the sky becomes overcast, and the sun
seems to sink behind a bank of cloud. A distant
peal of thunder is heard. The new-chum, who is
out on the run, heads for home; the bushman
rides on and takes no notice. The storm comes
closer. With startling suddenness a couple of
claps of thunder rattle amongst the clouds
overhead. The new-chum rides faster; the
bushman’s lip curls itself with the natural
bush bitterness as he turns his back to the wind.
In half-a-minute the storm is upon him, and it is
—dust! . .
The sun sinks wan and weary-looking behind
the clouds of dust, as though he, too, were weak
and wasted with the long, weary struggle against
the drought. Slowly he sinks till, with a sudden
fall, he appears to lose his hold and drop right out
of the sky.
In the east the moon rises slowly, red and
hard and grim. The ’possums begin to ap-
pear on the hollow trees, the mopokes break out
into a mournful hooting along the dry river-bed,
the trees grow dark and ghostly, casting strange,
uncertain shadows, and another day is gone. To-
morrow, we know, will be just such another.

"Given up for Dead.
Restored to Perfect Health’’
Only three bottles cure severe lameness from
rheumatism, flesh is regained, eyesight improved,
and natural health returns.

"I have been a great sufferer from rheumatism and liver complaint, and
was very lame.
“My brother, who was very ill, was given up for dead by the doctors. But
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla put new life in him, and he and my father, hearing I was so
ill, recommended this medicine to me. Before I had taken three bottles I felt
improved. My lameness began to leave me and I began to feel like a new
woman. I also regained much flesh which I had lost. Strange though it may
seem, my eyesight, which had become weak, gradually became stronger, until it
was perfectly natural.”
This testimony from Mrs. Mary Bright (whose portrait is here given), of Cor-
nish Town, Cobar, New South Wales, must strongly impress all who read it.
It tells of the wonderful power of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla to drive disease out of
the system.
How could a testimonial tell more? How could a remedy do more? Put
your confidence in Ayer’s Sarsaparilla,
“The World’s Greatest Family Medicine.”
Because other medicines have failed should not discourage you. One great
medicine is left for you—Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. It acts directly on the blood,
takes out all impurities.
