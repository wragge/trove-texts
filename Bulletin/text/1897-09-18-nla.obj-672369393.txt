THE AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH!
Sounds well—doesn’t it ? But the DOMINION OF AUSTRALIA
would sound better —for
We have a Common Wealth in the
Price and Quality of
CAMEO CIGARETTES.
THE RED PAGE.
Some time in the eighties Australia, for
her sins, was visited by Douglas Brooke
Wheelton Sladen. Australia has never re-
covered from the shock. In vain has she
urged her kangaroo to prodigious leaps of
disavowal : behind her the incubus sticks
like a burr. Let us writhe.
• » * *
Sladen came to this country in the eighties,
a young man of 25 or so. He was con-
nected with Melb. University, and joined
Melbourne degrees to his Oxford bachelor-
ship of arts. Then, for a short time, he
came to Sydney. He was in Australia four
or five years altogether, spending nearly the
whole time in the cities named. Ten
years ago he returned to England, and be-
came ‘ a representative Australian. ’ He has
been ‘ a representative Australian ’ ever
since. Let us writhe.
» * * •
In Australia, from a literary point of
view, Sladen seemed a consummate type
of British impudence. Modest natives
fairly wilted before him. His ‘ Haw ! ’
pervaded the whole continent, and sent a
resounding echo \as far as Maoriland. He
had limited brain, and limitless energy.
And he wrote ‘ poetry ‘ poetry inspired by
life and scenery in Australia.’ Australia
writhed.
* * * *
This is some of Sladen’s * poetry,’ from a.
volume which is called ‘Australian Lyrics,’
and contains not one verse that is lyrical, not
one idea that is essentially Australian.
Mbs. Watson. A Queensland Heroine.
Yes ! bury this woman as heroes are buried
A daughter and type of the conquering race—
With bayonets sheathed and with ranks un-
serried ;
For she fought with the savages face to face,
And conquered. There’s many a chapter in story
With heroines’ names writ in characters fair,
But never a one that outglitters in glory
The wife of the fisher of b4che-de-mer.
‘With ranks unserried.’ But why ‘ un-
serry ’ the ranks ? Alas ! the rhyme will
have it so. Sladen has learnt that it is good
to lead off with a strong sentiment, strongly
expressed ; but he is no poet, and Pegasus
has thrown him off’ in two strides. The rest
is trite and tumty-tumty.
» * * *
In nine verses Sladen reduces tragedy to
bathos, and trails abysmal commonplaces
over an inspiring theme. Anti-climax
follows anti-climax. Chopped lines tumble
on top of chopped lines as if verse-writing
were a matter of throwing logs on a domestic
wood-heap : Sladen, the purveyor, heaving
from the cart whatever is handiest. E.g.
This woman was born of a nation of freemen, —
Their birthright to dare and to die on the wave;
Yet even to Britain’s adventurous seamen
’Twere hardly disgrace if they seemed not as
brave.
What wonder if Gilbert, who sank in the
“ Squirrel,”
Or Davis, or Baffin, or Frobisher shrank
From facing the strange supernatural peril
Of crossing the sea in a worn water-tank ?
Amiable instances —lugged in by the ear
and a waistcoat-flap ! Drake is absent, poor
fellow !—the line wouldn’t hold him. And
ai! for Captain Cook. Observe, too, the
faithful touches of the master ! the ‘ corro-
borative detail, intended to give artistic
verisimilitude to a bald and unconvincing
narrative ’ ! —in a word, the water-tank ! In
the next verse it appears as a boiler—
A pitiful story ! —this val-i-ant woman
Who tempted the sea (here a dozen leagues
wide),
Thus shipped, after routing the barbarous foeman
When she came to a haven to shelter her, died.
Eight days on the waves in a rust-eaten boiler—
(She had better by half have been slaughtered
at first).
And the foe that outflanked her, her only one
foiler,
Stands dim in her diary—“ Dead with thirst.”
* * * •
Note the airy, off-hand parenthesis— ‘ here
a dozen leagues wide.’ Sladen is not really
concerned about the sea’s width ; but his
prescient imagination has already leaped to
the‘died ’in line 4; and . . . exactly! And
mark ‘the barbarous foeman King Billy of
Buckaroo !—how purely Australian in refer-
ence and emphasis ! how thrillingly lyncal .
And the ‘slaughtered’ ! and the ‘only one
foiler ’ ! and the rest ! But Sladen is gather-
ing himself for his famous, his most tre-
mendous effort . . • watch him soar 1
No drain left to drink—yet she would nob be fear-
ful
But in painful and feeble handwriting had writ
That her baby “ was better and more cheerful,
And condensed milk appeared to agree with it.
Not even the steamer when passing so near her,
Unheeding the signals she hoisted in vain,
Could sicken the hope from her heart or die-
cheer her;
She noted it down, but she did nob oomplain.
» » * •
Is that poetry, hein ? Is it Australian ? is
it lyrical 1 does it combine grandeur with ten-
derness, pathos with melody ? is it full of
nobility, sublimity, sawdust? But there is
another verse —hardly less touching, less
graceful; and here are Drake and Cook, and
Nelson into the bargain !
If only a watch had been kept on that steamer i
What has not that captain to answer for,
(Well, he has to answer for one of the worst
attempts at verse ever made in English.)
Sent thither by Heaven in time to redeem her !
He will surely be haunted for evermore.
(Not, let us hope, by Sladen’s rhymes. No
offence, however rank, could deserve that!)
Were she living who fought then and wrought
then so well, sons
Might perchance have been born in our own far
north
(‘ Our own far north ’!—Sladen's own !
the far north of the Condensed Milkman !
Now, by Emu ! . . .)
To match with the Drakes and the Cooks and the
Nelsons
Whom the Mother of Continents has brought
forth.
* • * *
And this is the work of a B. A., Oxford;
B.A. and LL.B., Melbourne ! This is an
‘Australian lyric,’the product of a ‘repre-
sentative Australian,’ of a man whose name
is often heard in London minor literary
circles, often paragraphed in London minor
society papers ! . . . Well !
* • • •
It must be owned that all Sladen’s ‘ lyrics ’
are not as bad as this ; but they are nearly.
There is always the same dull mouthing of
dull ideas ; the same class of puerilities and
stupidities ; the same utter absence of
melody and style, of anything that looks like
sincere feeling or original capacity. And
Sladen went ~to England and published
‘ Australian Lyrics ’ and several other
volumes of verse—of one of which a ladies’
paper, ‘ The Queen ’ (to which Sladen con-
tributed), wrote that ‘Mr. Sladen pays a
tribute to the memory of Lindsay Gordon,
the “Poet of Yictoria ; ” but that erratic
and unfortunate genius left little behind
him that is so good as many parts of Mr.
Sladen’s work. Taken altogether it gives him
a high cloAm to be considered the best poet that
Australia has yet produced. ’ Doff cabbage-
trees to Sladen, Australia’s premier poet !
And Sladen solemnly printed this testi-
monial in the forefront of ‘ Australian
Lyrics’—in the vestibule of the temple
where the Condensed Milk Poem is en-
shrined ! . . . Well ! !
• * • *
British impudence ! —was there ever im-
pudence in the world to match it ? Every
week new Sladens reach our shores, with
as much brain-quality, intellectual acumen,
as the original Sladen—that is to say, with
little or none. But they enter our Parlia-
ments ; they fill our profitable employments ;
they marry" our daughters and sisters (and
sometimes thrash ’em into divorce); they
own our lands; they rule our businesses ;
they dominate our country. Everywhere
the modest and brainier Australian stands
aside, or nearly everywhere : the Briton
has far more share in the destiny of Aus-
tralia than his intelligence warrants, or his
numbers entitle him to. And all this from
a capacity to eat heavily and drink heavily,
and present letters of introduction at Govern-
ment House, and bilk a tailor. No, not all ;
for something must be allowed for that
British energy which is to British impu-
dence as root to flower. In Emerson’s esti-
mate of the * English the recurrence of re-
ferences to this quality shows how strongly
it impressed him.
I find the Englishman to be him of all men who
stands firmest in his shoes. They have in them-
selves what they value in their horses, mettle and
bottom. ... It was an odd proof of this impres-
sive energy, that, in my lectures, I hesitated to
read and threw out for its impertinence many a
disparaging phrase which I had been accustomed
to spin about poor, thin, unable mortals; so much
had the fine physique and the personal vigor of
this robust race worked on my imagination.
Emerson would have left in those phrases for
an Australian course of lectures.
* * * *
Doff cabbage-trees (and this time in
earnest) to British energy! There is no
doubt that in the average man the failure
to push himself forward implies a cer-
tain slackness of fibre, feebleness of
constitution ; and modesty, like ‘ dowdyism,
is an expression of imperfect vitality.' But
British energy cannot score all round. The
beer-swilling, beef-eating John Bull type is
the type most opposed to the poetical and
artistic temperament; and when by defect
of education or force of circumstance it
is found in the poetical or artistic held,
where body - quality yields to brain-
quality, the result is ... a Sladen. Yery
likely a successful Sladen, as worldly
success goes ; a Sladen who puffs and is
puffed by men of his own calibre ; but still
. . . a Sladen.
* * * *
Some ten years ago Sladen went to Lon-
don, and he seems to have prospered by
log-rolling. He collected a book of Austra-
lian verse which is full of blunders and
inadequacies $ gives Sladen’s own verse
almost as much space as Kendall and
Stephens ; contains one ‘ Rondel ’ which
appears to be the only decent thing Sladen
ever wrote ; and is readable and useful in
spite of all. Then Sladen travelled in Japan,
and wrote a valueless book about his trip ;
he travelled in Canada and wrote another
valueless book ; and he compiled a collection
of verses from ‘Younger American Poets,’
which is really well done, and is about the
best book of the kind issued. At forty-one
years of age the Sladen of to-day is much
more capable than the' callow and cocksure
young man of the eighties.
• * • *
But he is still the same old Sladen. And
now, very late on the page, we are getting to
the gist of the matter —the only reason for
probing these old sores. A few months ago
Barrere and Leland’s ‘ Slang Dictionary ’
was reprinted in cheaper form : the original
edition was expensive, and sold only to sub-
scribers. This dictionary is a good diction-
ary, in that it contains much out-of-the-way
information on interesting questions of word
and phrase. It is a bad dictionary, in that
thousands of references are supplied without
a date—which robs them of a full three-
fourths of their value ; and in that, being
very incapably edited, no attempt has been
made to reduce the items to a qualitative
standard. The editor (whom one judges to
be Barrere, working on Leland’s materials)
appears to have put in everything forwarded
to him as slang, in the endeavour to swell his
volumes to imposing size. Expressions con-
fined to a limited time, or district, have been
placed on an equal footing with those used
over a long period, a whole country ; and
there is no clue to the extent of vogue.
Further, the derivations are for the most
part sadly inadequate, as if the editor had
wished to make his book with as little pains
as possible. And . . . this is also ‘ the
first Slang Dictionary to which the rich and
racy slang of the fifth continent —the mighty
Australian commonwealth of the future—
has been contributed by one long resident
in the country and familiar both with its
life and its literature.’ Our prophetic soul!
* * » *
Some examples of Australian slang from
‘A Dictionary of Slang, Jargon, and Cant’
(Lond., Geo. Bell, 1897).
Anty-up (Australian and American), a game of
cards.
As they ride up, a savage-looking half-bred bull-dog
yelps hoarsely, and two or three men creep out from
underneath the tarpaulin of the nearest dray, where they
have been playing anty-up (a favorite game with cards)
for tobacco. John recognises a teamster who has been
employed by him.— D. Sladen.
Artesian (Australian, popular), colonial beer.
People in Gippsland, Victoria, use artesian just as
Tasmanians use cascade, in the sense of ‘beer,’
because the one is manufactured from the oele»
brated artesian well at Sale, Grippsland, and th«
other from the cascade water.
Australian flag (Anglo-Australian slang), the
bottom of a shirt. The Australian who lives up
the country generally wears a belt instead of
braces, the result being that, when he exerts him-
self, there is usually a great fold of shirt protruding
between his small clothes and his waistcoat, which
Englishmen have called in scorn the Australian
flag. The Cornstalk talks of him as a ‘ new
chum ’; he talks of the Cornstalk as ‘showing the
Australian flag. ’
Australian grip (up-country Australian), a
hearty shake of the hand (compare Masonic grip).
The bushman shakes hands very heartily—a long
grip with the whole hand, following three deep
shakes. He does not crush your hand ; but he is
sarcastic about the ‘ limp shakes ’ and 1 one-tinge*
shakes ’ of people ‘ newly out from home.’
None the less
Was he a graceful, well-bred host,
But he was hearty in accost.
And giving the Australian grip
And good up-country fellowship as bushmen.
— D. B. W. Sladen: A Summer Christmas.
Back block (Australian), the country outside the
margin of the settled districts.
Like the brief flight of a sparrow upon a wintry night,
Out of the frost and darkness into the warm and litrht.
Is the advent of a stranger in the hack blocks out west,
Here to-night, and gone to-morrow, after food, roof, and
rest.
— D. B. IF. Sladen: Out West in Queensland..
* * * *
Isn’t it awful ! And so it goes on through-
out the dictionary —ignorant or misleading
explanations of actual slang ; disquisitions on
imaginary ditto ; attributions to all Australia
of expressions which, a dozen years ago, had
temporary vogue in a limited district—backed
up and enforced by scores of references to
Sladen’s reminiscences, or quotations from
his unspeakable verses ! Occasionally there
is a reference to ‘Dr. Kendall,’ to ‘J. B.
Stephens, the Australian comic poet,’ and to
other writers on Australia ; but first and
last and foremost is Sladen. Isn't it awful!
* * * *
It is useless to protest, apparently. Sladen
has been puffed into London prominence as
‘a representative Australian,’ and ‘The
Bulletin’s ’ affirmation on behalf of Australia
that in that capacity he is an impudent
literary humbug will assuredly never reach
the minds of all the purchasers of the ‘ Slang
Dictionary ’ —whom Sladen’s pretensions and
misrepresentations will continue to lead astray
as long as the book lasts, and after that. For
Barrere and Leland have each done good
work in fields they know aiid understand;
and future editors will argue from the part
to the whole, and will quote as gospel the
blunders which they have quasi-authorised ;
and five centuries hence, in all probability,
some learned philologist will dig up a Sladen
myth and a Sladen ‘ poem,’ and found
thereon an appalling argument to prove that
the representative aboriginal of this epoch
had very large teeth and a very small skull
and an exceedingly low facial angle, and
went to battle waving his flag in his ‘ small
clothes ’ and excited to frenzy by ‘ artesian.
One can only hope that the historian of the
period will be able to refer to this notice (it
is written to that end) and authoritatively
contradict the philologist ; and if after
five centuries, in enumerating the blessings
which Britain has conferred upon this
country, he is unable to decide whether we
have most reason to be grateful for her con-
victs, or for her rabbits, or for her Sladen,
he will at least have this excuse, that it is
not so easy to settle the question even while
the fruits of each blessing visibly remain to
us. And in the meantime —let us writhe.

SURGEON LANGSTON, M.R.C.S., Eng.,
THE GREATEST AND MOST SUCCESSFUL PRACTI-
TIONER IN THE WORLD
But few of noted specialists have sprung- into pre-emin-
ence and an immense practice as Surgeon Langston, a
resident and practitioner at 121 Collins-street, Melbourne.
His name has become almost literally a household word ;
almost every other man you meet has a wonderful story to
relate of some almost miraculous cure he has performed
in an acute or chronic case of long standing, where other
physicians have failed. He addresses himself in particular
to cases that have baffled the skill and science of other
doctors. His name is a sufficient guarantee of a perfect
cure of every case he undertakes. Consult him this day.
It may save you much mental and physical suffering, and
add golden years to your life.
YOUNG MEN. You will find this distinguished doctor
your best friend and benefactor. If you are troubled
with want of sleep, a tired, gloomy feeling, and loss
of energy, which impair both your body and brain,
and absolutely unfit you for study, business, or the
proper enjoyment of life; if you are suffering from these
or similar symptoms you know the cause. Before it is
everlastingly too late, consult this reliable old specialist,
who thoroughly understands your trouble, and can treat
it with unfailing success.
MIDDLE-AGED MEN. There are many of you afflicted
with weak, aching back and kidneys, loss of mental and
physical power and vigor, and not unfrequently accom-
panied by an impairment of the general health. In justice
to this celebrated specialist it can be truthfully stated
that in all such cases of middle-aged men, as well of
young men, his success has been almost invariable.
Troubles of every kind, name and nature, treated far in
advance of any institution in Australia—female com-
plaints, liver, lung, chest, throat, stomach, bladder,
kidney and heart disease ; rupture, piles, fistula, hydrocele
and kidney troubles.
VARICOCELE. Surgeon Langston’s Electric Quadrant

whose New and Scientific Treatment, by purifying and
enriching the blood, gives new life and tone to the
whole nervous and muscular systems, and builds up a
new constitution in the most enfeebled. The first week of
treatment brings glad relief, and PERSEVERANCE
ensures a thorough and LASTING CURE.
MEN
Should try Dr. SPEER’S celebrated Remedies, which strike
at the root of the disease. The symptoms gradually dis-
appear, vigor and lost health return, sunken eyes retain
their old lustre. The blood-giving principle of the medi-
cine secures a healthy appearance, the patient finds
himself gaining in weight and flesh, hollow and sunken
cheeks become rounded ; the weak and shattered consti-
tution is restored, and the former sufferer finds himself
permanently cured with all the animation and vigor of
life.
ALL CONSULTATIONS FREE.
Persons residing at a distance can, by describing their
troubles in detail, be treated at home. The course of
treatment will not in any way interfere with their
business.
Every person applying to the Doctor will receive a
straightforward and candid opinion of the case, and the
possibility of a cure. If the patient is curable, he will tell
him so ; if not, he will also tell him. He undertakes no

Having 1 completed his New and Centrally-situated
Electrical & Consulting Rooms
Will be Pleased to Welcome his Friends
and Patients at
137 Elizabeth-street, SYDNEY.
Dr. GMBBOKTS,
Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
Private, Nervous and Skin Diseases.
He has, by diligent research, investigated _ their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing symptoms, namely : —Frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fullness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fearof something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, &e.,
&c., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.
On Receipt of 6d. in Stamps He Will Send,
POST FREE,
A COMPLETE MEDICAL WORK,
fully describing how all private, nervous, and
skin diseases may be quickly and permanently
CURED, without loss of time and money. This
book will be of great assistance in making you
thoroughly acquainted with those diseases so
common in these colonies, and may enable you to
restore some poor sufferer to health and happiness
after having lost all hope.
ONE POUND is Sufficient to Send
for Remedies necessary for the Cure of
DEBILIT Y,
And should be enclosed in the first letter.
Remember, “Procrastination is the Thief of
Time.” If, therefore, you experience any of the
symptoms enumerated above, DO NOT DELAY,
your case requires advice, and you can either call
and consult the Doctor personally, or, if you
reside at a distance, you can sit down quietly,
in the privacy of your own chamber, and write out
a full description of your case, and send it by post.
X) R. GIBBONS
will then write you a candid and straightforward
opinion. If, in writing, you do not feel compe-
tent to fully describe your case, send 6d. in
stamps, and Dr. Gibbons will send you, post
free, the Latest Edition of his Celebrated Work,
in which you will find a list of carefully-prepared
questions that will assist you in giving a true
description of your ailment.
NONE NEED DESPAIR,
as in every case undertaken by Dr. GIBBONS
A Permanent Cure
is absolutely assured.
Dr. GIBBONS uses none but the very purest
remedies, and never, under any circumstances,
prescribes Mercury in any form.
PATIENTS are reminded that their LETTERS
ARE DESTROYED BY FIRE
immediately they have been read and answered,

All cases are treated strictly confidentially.
In publishing the folloiving remarkable state-
ments, we do so at the special wish of the writers
only ; otherwise secrecy is considered inviolable,
letters and particulars of cases being destroyed
at the termination of same.
Mr. J. H. WEHR, FARMER,
WASLEYS, S.A. writes “ I can-
not refrain from adding my testi-
monial to your numerous list. In
justice to science, humanity, and
yourselves I must say that your
treatment of sorrowful afflictions is
past all belief. For seventeen years
I have been a sufferer, and four
months ago I went from bad to
worse ; in fact lost all hope of ever
being well again. When I visited
you I was at once placed under a
course of treatment entirely new to
myself, and from the first I was able to attend to my
occupation as farmer. lam happy to state that lam now
well and better than I have been for years, but shall
follow your advice and take the remedies for some time to
do away with all risk. I shall always remain indebted to
you for my wonderful cure.”
ANTHONY BARRY, Castle Inn,
Hindley-street, Adelaide, writes :
“ I will be glad if you will publish
the following for the benefit of suf-
ferers. For the last five years I
have been in the West, having
worked from Lake Darley to the
Horse Shoe Bend in Murchison.
Nearly the whole of the time I have
been a sufferer from Debility,
and loss of energy, always moping
alone, afraid to join in any
conversation, noises in the ears, and other symp-
toms too numerous to mention ; in fact, was a nuisance
to myself and mates. Tried many advertised remedies
without obtaining any relief. On my way to New Guinea,
and hearing of so many from the West on their way to
other colonies breaking their journey at Adelaide to
obtain your treatment, I decided to do the same. lam
glad to say I now feel fit to continue my journey without
fear, and am sure I have only to take your remedies a
little longer'to obtain a thorough cure. lam well known
in all parts of the West, and write this that my mates and
others may know where they can obtain a certain cure,”
Mr. M. J. DENAHY, Beryl
Street, Broken Hill, writes: —
“ Your remedies have acted
like magic in my case, having
been a sufferer for months
from weakness, and through
weakness I was so ill that I
had to give up work, and I
say truthfully I never thought
I should ever regain my
strength, as I took so much
medicine before seeing you
and without feeling the
slightest bit better, when
fortunately I met a patient of
yours, Mr. J. Kent, who
advised me to lose no time,
and, using his own words, he
said : 1 The only chance you
have is to go to Brunswick, Hamilton & Co., who will
very soon put you right,’ and I am thankful I took his
advice, for since I took your remedies I am as well and as
strong as ever I was in my life. I cannot thank you suffi-
cient for what you have done for me.”
REMARKABLE CURE OF DEBILITY.
Mr. J. W. AITCHISON, 22 North-st., Adelaide, writes:
—“ Gentlemen,—l cannot refrain from adding my testi-
mony to your extraordinary and most marvellous treat-
ment of one of the worst cases of Debility such as mine
was. Since being under your care I can safely say that I
am a strong man once more, and the distressing symptoms
from what I was suffering from have all disappeared in a
most miraculous manner. I had previously been under
the care of five different practitioners for the past four
years ; purchased three different galvanic or electric belts,
without deriving any benefit whatsoever. I had given up
all hope of ever being myself again, when I was recom-
mended to see you. In two weeks’ time I began to feel
improvement, and your remedies did more for me than
the whole four years’ treatment with others. I feel as if
I can never thank you enough, and, as I should like other
sufferers to know what you have done for me, make what-
ever use you like of this.”
JOSEPH MABTIN, Cen
tral Mine, Broken Hill,
writes :—“ Accept this tes-
timonial in recognition tor
the valuable services you
have rendered me by per-
forming a wonderful cure of
my case, which has been on
me for over five years, and
now that I am well and tell
you that I spent over £2OO
before consulting you, and
deriving not a farthing’s
worth of benefit from emin-
ent men makes my case one
that other sufferers should
hear about, so that they can
be treated and cured as I am,
and also made strong,
m
healthy, and happy, which I never thought could be done
until I was a short time under your care. I could con-
tinue for months writing of the misery and anxiety which
I have suffered, and it makes this testimonial one of great
value, not only to you, but also to those who may be
sufferers like I was, and those that read this and will take
my advice and place their case in your hands will not only
thank you, but also me for making it known to them.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Hunk of pure domestic felicity as reported
in Auckland police-court
The woman deposed that since their arrival from Mel-
bourne, six months ago, she had been confined to the
kitchen, not being allowed to enter any other room in
the house except her bedroom, where she slept with one
of her daughters. The children were not allowed to call
her mother, that name being reserved for the eldest
daughter, who was empowered to do aTl the punishin,. in
the house. The mother had to do all the hard work. On
one occasion the children tied her in a chair and beat
her and the father did not reprimand them. On several
occasions he struck her. When he went for a holiday she
had to remain at home in the kitchen or cellar, all the
doors of the house being locked She had never received
any money. .
WATTLE TIME.
Once again Spring’s brimming tide
Flows and floods on every side;
Joys and hopes like music throng,
Make the day one living song :
And the pulsing of delight
Holds me wakeful oft at night,
Lulled in passionate content
With the balmy stillness, rent
All at once by rapturous notes
Poured from thrushes’ bubbling thro:.ls.
Open-eyed and calm I lie,
Feel it sweet to live or die ;
While along the shadowy, dim
Chamber-ceiling, like a hymn
Swelling up from far away,
Creeps the tremulous flush of day.
Through the open window steal
Dawn’s pure breathings, and I feel,
O, my love, as if your breath —
It could waken me from death —
Softly came upon my face
From your dark and silent place.
Gathered sprays of golden bloom
Waft within my lonely room
Fragrance faint, that seems to s'. ;■ 7
From a springtide far away.
One with memory it seems,
Yivid as the light of dreams,
One with feeling, one with sense,
With the past—that, as in dense
Purple fume of altars, curls
Round me with its drowsy whirls ;
Till I lose the silent room,
Only scent the suave perfume,
Feel your hand, your lips, your hr \
Sweeter than fresh violets prcssc I ;
Hear your tender, haunting words,
Clear as early songs of birds.
Soul of my soul, heart of heart,
Then I know we cannot part ;
Though grim Death has had his v. .11,
You are near me—with me still.
It was in the spring-time, dear,
Once you dallied with me here—
Spring-tiine of our lives and lien ' s.
Blossom falls and spring depart* ;
Life rolls in with fuller flood,
Flower and fruit succeed the bud,
Waking to delicious dreams,
All that is to all that seems.
While we hold it, pleasure flics ;
Clasping, clinging, passion dies.
Thus the wattle-bloom at last
Breathes not only of the past,
But, with all its memories,
Linked in subtle melodies,
Threading each harmonic chan"7
Through my life’s fantastic range,
Leads me onwards to the close,
Far or near, of joys and woes.
Soul of my soul, heart of heart,
Yours to me has been the part
Spring to Summer plays, or sho——s
June sends down to coming flows, s.
In my life is one thing fair ?
Yours the hand that sowed it there.
Is there blossom ? Is there fruit ?
In our love it had its root.
So, though memories fainter grow,
You are with me still, I know ;
From my life and from my heart
Never, O lost love, to part.

THE DAYS OF THE ROSES.
‘‘Days that were golden— days that were wreathed with
a garland of roses.”--Novaus.
This is the golden and sweet youth-tide,
When the world is fair and the world is wide,
And our hearts are as wide as the world and as
fair
And blithe as the song of the bird m the air;
So, comrades, sing with a cheery chime :
This is the golden and gracious time—
These are the days of the roses !
Free is the heart and free is the song,
And free is the lad as he laughs along ;
And the kiss of a maiden coy is free,
Though daintily shy may the red lips be ;
Where a kiss we find and a song’s sweet rhyme,
There is the golden and gracious time
There are the days of the rases !
So here’s a deep health to the heart that’s high,
And here’s to the love in a maiden’s eye !
And here’s to the lad and here’s to the lass,
And here’s to the foam on the sparkling glass,
And here’s to our land with its Lydian clime,
Here’s to the golden and gracious time —
Here’s to the days of the roses !
Q.
P. LUGTIG.
REALISATION.
If truth it be, as sages say,
That every wish and every dream
We cherish in our earthly day
Have real life in Nature’s scheme,
And live for us, though far away,
Where things exist and do not seem ;
Then, brother, sister, dread no more
The worst malignant Fate can do ;
Elsewhere, upon some radiant shore,
Wealth, Fame and Pleasure wait for you ;
And, O ! lost loves of mine, what store
Of’bliss for me when dreams come true !

SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 18, 1897.
To the People of Victoria.
At the general election, which is due next
month, the first sober Government which
Victoria has had for the best part of 20
years will appeal to the people for an expres-
sion of confidence and a renewed lease of
power. The Bulletin trusts that it will get
both in a most liberal spirit. It is just
possible that the country will, by-and-bye,
regret having given them, for no one can say
for certain what the Democratic politician of
to-day may not develope into to-morrow, but
on its past record the Tuiiner-Isaacs
Ministry deserves the largest majority the
province can give it. And on its past record
the Opposition is utterly hopeless. Very
often indeed the politician who is a Demo-
crat in his youth grows to be a bitter Tory in
his old age, therefore it is unsafe to prophesy
that the present Victorian Government will
always continue to deserve public confidence.
But it is not once in a thousand times that
the politician who is Tory in his youth is
anything save more Tory in his old age,
therefore it is almost absolutely certain that
its opponents will continue to deserve public
mistrust as heretofore. There is no possible
hope for Victoria in Gillies, and MTntyre,
and Thomas Bent, and Baronet O’Loghlen,
and Murray Smith, and the rest of the
miscellaneous bygones who make up the
Conservative party in the southern province.
Most of them have already been tried and
found wanting ; some more should have been
tried only an obliging Attorney-General re-
fused to take proceedings ; and the country
knows hardly any good, in a political sense,
of any of them.
♦ * * *
George Turner is certainly not an ideal
Premier or the head of an ideal Government,
as Australians used to understand that
liazy adjective. The men whom Australia
used to reverence were the “men who made
the country.” Vogel was of that type ; so
were MTlwraith and, in a less degree,
Parkes. Duncan Gillies would have been
of it also if he was a foot taller and several
inches more round the chest, and he had a
huge beard, and was full of bass blasphemy,
and if he had gone off with somebody else’s
wife occasionally ; he had all the qualities of
the men who made the country, save the
large piratical exterior and the swashbuck-
lering habit of mind. Dibbs would have
been another of these gods if he had been in
power ten years earlier. John Forrest, of
Westralia, is the last sample of the race.
The “men who made the country” were a
curse from which Australia will not recover
for many, many years. They w r ere re-
verenced because they opened up Australia
at an amazing rate, built railways and
bridges, constructed roads, made harbours,
and brought the outward signs of civilisation
into a new continent with amazing velocity.
Looking back now, the nation dimly discerns
that all the notable things they really did
were to howl and look imposing and borrow
money. The veriest fool can borrow money
if there are plenty of people willing to lend
it, as was the case then ; and the veriest
fool, when he has borrowed the money, can
hire expert—more or less expert—men to
plan out and construct the railways, roads,
bridges, wharves, harbors, and other tilings.
The qualifications of a great statesman of the
Australian pioneer type were these three :
He had to be masterful and imposing and
hard and pushing and big of voice and chest
to climb into power. He required the
courage to borrow, which everybody has, and
the courage to spend, which every Juggins
has. And he required to be ignorant enough
not to see the disaster which his policy would
bring by-and-bye, or else callous enough not
to care. With a little more economy, more
honesty, more foresight, and a little less de-
sire* to shirk taxation in the early, rich,
golden days, most of the Australias might
have built their early railways out of revenue,
and the income derived from them would
have helped to build more lines, and finally
the whole system could have been con-
structed, more slowly yet quite rapidly
enough, without debt at all. The chief
reason which Australia has to be grateful to
the statesmen who loom so large in its early
history is that they had the biggest oppor-
tunity given to any set of men since the
days of Columbus, and they boomed it away.
* * ♦ *
The useful politician of to-day is a man of
a different order. He exists because the
ideal politician of some years ago made
him absolutely necessary. Ballance was
about the first of the new order.
Turner is another representative of it ;
so is Kingston, though in a less degree.
The Premier who succeeds Forrest
will have to be of the same stamp,
unless Westralia is to be the first defaulter
in the Seven Provinces. The days of the
politician who was great because he furiously
damned the expense are over, for the suffi-
cient reason that the expense declines to be
damned any longer, and the political genius
of to-day is the man with an infinite capacity
for repairs. Among all the many political
reforms required in Australia, and they are
practically innumerable, the first and most
urgent is to straighten up the financial
wreck which the bygone men of mark left
behind them, and to make the Australians a
self-reliant community, instead of a nation
whose very soul is up the spout of the British
pawnbroker. Financial independence is
every whit as important as political inde-
pendence, and because The Bulletin is a
Republican organ it wants to see Australia
dominated neither by a British Government
nor by a British usurer. But if it had to
choose between the two—if it was possible to
get rid of one burden only and not of the
other—then it would be more than half
inclined to choose freedom from the British
money-lender. Salisbury and Chamber-
lain are types of the political boss ; Hooley
and Barnato and the Cohen tribe in general
of the financial one ; and as a suzerain Salis-
bury looks more dignified than Hooley.
* * * *
The present Victorian Ministers have done
more than any other political combination in
Australia to save their country from selling
itself into worse bondage to the tribe of
Hooley, and The Bulletin regards this as
a truly democratic work, and. supports them
on democratic principles. Though they have
never labelled themselves Democrats, they
have worked all through on straighter Radical
principles than any other Government in
Australia. A Ministry with the State Land
Bank, the Companies Act, the income-tax
policy, the Factories Act, and the minimum-
wage law to its credit deserves the best sup-
port the masses can give it, no matter how it
labels itself. It certainly hasn’t done nearly
so much as was expected of it, but that is
mainly owing to the unmanageableness and
the desperate slowness of the political
machine with which it has to work. Probably
the worst charge brought against it is that it
hasn’t once attempted the biggest and most
urgent reform of all—the reformation of the
Legislative Council. Against this must be
set the fact that, unless the House of 48
Rich Landlords chooses to pass an Act for its
own reformation, which it almost certainly
would not do voluntarily, there is no power
short of revolution, or a general attack by an
infuriated populace armed with clubs, which
can shift it. An elective institution whose
members must consist of wealthy landholders,
in a country where wealthy landholders are
few and rigidly Tory, can’t be made Liberal
by any legal means. If the Turner Govern-
ment had spent the last three years in work-
ing up a furious crusade against the House
of Rich Landlords it might, or it might not,
have aroused sufficient national indignation
to force that dreadful body to mend its ways.
But, in that case, all the other work that has
been done would probably have had to be
postponed, and, with so many urgent matters
on hand, it was no fit time for crusading.
* * * *
The present Victorian Government doesn’t
consist of great men, and it is well for the
country that it doesn't; another five years of
really great men of the old Australian type
would reduce the richest province in the
seven to public insolvency. But it is the
best, most honest, and most courageous
Ministry that, so far as the public is able to
see, can be made out of the materials avail-
able. Even if the country were mad enough
to go back to the old crowd which asks to be
restored to power—the Bent and O’Loghlen
and Gillies and M’lntyre and Davies push
—there is no element of cohesion among
them. Their policy consisted only in float-
ing big loans and sitting down to watch the
land-boom as it whizzed past ; and now that
there is no land-boom to watch and the
country’s credit is no longer good enough
for immense loans, there is nothing left that
they can do. The only definite principle
they have is that half-a-dozen of them are
theoretical Freetraders, but as Victoria has
practically no land revenue the Customs
duties are its main source of revenue, and, if
they were abolished, the biggest land-
tax the world has seen in recent years
would be required to fill their place.
And as the Victorian Freetraders—barring
the weird Max Hirsch —are not land-taxers,
the inference is that if the only Opposition
section which has a policy were returned to
power it couldn’t carry out its alleged policy
after all, and wouldn’t attempt to, and
doesn’t want to. Under thebe circumstances,
the present Victorian Government promises
to come back from the poll with a stronger
majority and a surer seat than it even now
possesses. Nothing is absolutely certain in
politics—a profession in which so strange a
person as T. Bent could keep afloat for
many years must have many unaccountable
phases in it—but this seems as certain as
anything in politics reasonably can be.
A Year of Frectrade.
The new Reid tariff came into force—or rather
the earliest instalment of it did—on Ist January,
1896, therefore the period ending 31st Decem-
ber, 1896, was the first complete year of the
new policy. Last week the New South Wales
Statistical Department issued the industrial re-
turns for that year, and the results are only
moderately encouraging. At the same time they
are rather difficult to sort out. Up to the end
of 1895—the last year of Protection—the official
definition of a factory in New South Wales was
a place where five or more workers were em-
ployed under certain conditions, and only such
establishments were reckoned in the official re-
turn. This year the definition has been altered
to include places where four, or even a smaller
numberof workers are employed, and this altera-
tion takes in 4000 extra workers, and confuses
things badly. The change comes just at a time
when it was desirable that the facts should be
more than usually explicit, so that fiscal con
troversialists, hurling jagged masses of statistics
at each other in defence of their respective
faiths, could do so with a clear conscience, and
with as little room as possible for obscuring the
issue. Still, despite the change, and the con-
sequent obscurity, a few points are sufficiently
clear.
* * m m
Going on the old basis there are now 45,222
“ hands ” employed in the factories and works
of New South Wales. This is 1389 more than
were employed last year. Since the great
paralysis in 1893, the year when Australia’s
financial curses came home to roost, there has
been a continuous increase. In 1894 the number
of employes advanced by 3833 ; in 1895 the
improvement was 1082 ; in 1896 the increase, as
above stated, was 1389. The result is that
things are now almost, but not quite, as good
as they were in 1889. Taking the last ten
years, the number of people employed in Corn-
stalk industries increased in 1887, 1889, 1891,
1894-5-6, and it diminished in 1888, 1890, 1892,
and 1893. The net result is that the country
hasn’t quite got back to where it was a long
time ago, but it is gradually getting there, so
far as the number of industrial employes is con-
cerned. Beyond t his there are few possibilities
of accurate comparison. The tables show the
number of persons employed in each industry
in former years on the old basis, and compare
them with those employed in 1896 on the new
basis—which includes 4000 workers of which
the old system took no notice whatever. Still,
a few interesting facts can be dug out here and
there.
* * » *
The new policy of reckoning any place where
four people are employed as a factory increases
the numberof New South Wales boot-factories
from 66 to 82. Nevertheless, the number
of persons employed has decreased from
3743 on the old basis to 3499 on the
much wider new basis, and the number of pairs
manufactured is 150,000 less. Probably if the
old system of comparison had been adhered to
the output would have been 200,000 pairs less.
The brewery employes, despite the new and
more liberal method of computation, have
diminished by 57. There are seven fewer soap
and cindle factories ; 106 fewer employes, and
the output is 149,0001 b. soap and 900,0001 b.
candles less than that for 1895. Woollen mills
employ 10 less hands, and the output has gone
down slightly. The number of employes in the
slop clothing business drops in one act from
1777 to 1255. Sawmill employes declined from
3402 to 3187. There is also a decline in the
number of persons employed in boiling-down
establishments, biscuit factories, meat-pre-
serving works, joinery works, agricultural im-
plement factories, shipbuilding yards, and
among basket-makers, dyers, rope-makers,
tobacco-factory employes, and various others.
In many cases where there is a decline it would
have been larger but for the new method of
computation, and in others where there is a
small increase, there would probably have been
a falling-oft if the old method had been adhered
to. Also, where there is a legitimate increase,
the new system has often made it larger than it
would otherwise have been.
* • » *
There has undoubtedly been an increase ir.
the amount of employment apart from the
artificial inflation created by the change in the
methods of the Statistical Department, but it
is difficult to find out exactly in what industries
it has arisen. The largest visible increases are
in ice-works, brick-making establishments,
stone-quarries,potteries, smelting-works, docks,
printing establishments, and a few others. The
Statistical Department formerly refused to re-
cognise tailors and dress-makers at all; now it
includes them (3592 of them) among factory
employes, and this new departure further dis-
organises comparisons. The number of female
emplojAs, taking both years on the old basis,
has decreased 301, but this is wholly through
the slump in the slop-clothing and boot-factory
business, where 607 women have lost their
means of livelihood. In most other industries
they are either holding their own or increasing
steadily.
* * * •
Ihe one point on which the industrial
statistics are absolutely coherent is the rate of
wages. Apart from miners, whose industry
depends not on tariffs but mainly on the price
of metals in the European markets, and Govern-
ment employ6s who are also practically
independent of tariffs, the Government
Statistician fills nine pages with informa-
tion about the rates of pay in every
kind of private industry. Among the
trades enumerated there are 73 in which wages
were higher in 1896, the first year of the new
Freetrade era, than in 1895, the last year of
Protection. There are also 161 in which wages
are lower, so the balance, in this respect, is dis-
tinctly against the new order of things so far.
The most notable reductions are in boiling-
down establishments, tanneries, and wool-
washing establishments, among aerated-water
makers, confectioners, condiment - makers,
flour-millers, and ice-makers ; in jam, meat,
boot, clothing and waterproof factories ; in
woollen-mills, and among shirt-makers, brick-
makers, joiners, saw-millers, masons, carpen-
ters, machinists, bricklayers, painters, tin-
smiths, many classes of engineers, furniture
makers, electric-lighting people, box and brush
makers, and shop assistants. In one or two of
these industries the wages of an adult Cornstalk
Christian (sex not always specified, but presum-
ably female) are quoted as low as Bs. per
week—in one instance ss. is mentioned ; in a
good many they go as low as 10s. The wages
for adult males get down as low as Bs. per
week ; there are several instances where 12s. is
quoted ; £1 is quite common ; in one solitary
instance where adult males are apparently
alluded to (for boys and girls are specified
separately) 4s. is mentioned as the minimum
wage. New South Wales industries—some of
them, at all events—may be increasing under
Freetrade, but it seems to be only done bv
cutting down wages to a miserably low figure.
* * * *
It is a frequent assertion among Freetraders
that Protection claims to raise the standard of
wages and fails to do it; but as far as the facts
just issued by the State Statistician go, Free-
trade, in New South Wales at all events, has
little to boast of in the same direction. It is
also a common argument that Protection should
justify its claims in this direction by establish-
ing a legally-specified minimum wage—a living
wage in a liberal acceptation of the term—and
if protected industries can’t afford to pay it
they should go, and the discredited fiscal
system which supported them should go also.
The Bulletin, in view of the revelations in
the 1896 statistics, suggests that Freetrade—
which claims to be richer and better able to
stand the racket than Protection—should also
be handicapped, per act of Parliament, with
the obligation to pay a living wage to the
people employed in its industries, and if it can’t
stand the shock that it should go also. Appar-
ently the Freetrade industries of New South
Wales want a minimum wage law very badly
indeed.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Tillett on Federation.
Ben Tillett, the British Labor representative,
loses no opportunity to damn the Federation
movement. And yet he damns it very feebly,
as witness the following remarks in an Adelaide
interview :
I consider that the “ second Chamber ” difficulty and
the voting difficulty, and also the demand for the posses-
sion of certain repressive powers, constitute the Common-
wealth Bill a most undemocratic measure. It seems to
me to be rather a collusion on the part of the present
governing classes that accentuate class-differences as
well as the economic injustices that have been inflicted
upon the people. . . . I do not think they will gain
anything. I think they will lose. It seems to me that
even the best advocates of the measure have frittered
away their time, talents, opportunities, and speeches on
mere fiscal rather than domestic politics. The working-
classes, it may safely be said, are indifferent to the whole
matter. They have not been consulted. The elections
were a triumph for cliqueism, from a workman’s stand-
point. I venture to say that, if the Commonwealth Bill
in its present form is submitted to a referendum of the
people, that it will be rejected by ten to one. The Com-
monwealth Bill should be a constructive measure, and
devote itself to the building of a constitution and the
machinery of government that shall be representative of
the people in such a democratic manner that everybody
with an interest in the country shall be able to’ avail
themselves of its machinery But, instead of making the
constitution democratic, every effort seems to have been
made to rob the citizens and people of Australia of the
power to express their opinions by the ordinary methods
of representative government and election. The efforts
of the leading lights seem to have been directed in the
interests of mere property, of mere fiscal matters, and of
mere party shuffling.
The Convention represented five provinces, with
3,160,000 people. In three provinces, repre-
senting 2,838,000 people, the delegates were
elected on such popular principles that the male
population, almost to the last man, could vote
if it'wanted to. In one of these provinces, the
last woman could have a vote also. For years
beforehand the question was debated, talked,
preached, written and lectured about ;


every possible effort was made to rouse popular
enthusiasm, and the work of consulting the
working classes was going on incessantly. In
the Convention the ten nominee members from
Westralia left very early, and the business was
almost entirely done by four provinces—the
three where the elections were conducted on
democratic principles and one other—Tasmania.
When the Constitution is really drafted—if it
ever is—it is to be submitted to a popular vote,
and the working classes will again have every
opportunity to express their opinion upon it.
Under these circumstances Mr. Tillett might
explain how, in the three principal provinces
anyhow, these classes could have been con-
sulted more than they have been. Mr. Tillett,
apparently, holds a brief for the parochial
party—the fatted Heydon “push ” in N.S.W.,
the Six-Family crowd of Westralia, and the
Nelson-Tozer assemblage in Queensland —
though how he came into such company it is
difficult to imagine. And his objections to the
proposed Constitution are the vague utterances
of an oracle that doesn’t know its own meaning.
He doesn’t say what “repressive powers” are
in the Draft Bill, or in what possible way it
will “accentuate class differences as well as
economic in justices,” or what “ domestic poli-
tics ” should have been embodied. Also, the
large, loose statement that the Commonwealth
Bill “should be a constructive measure
and devote itself to the building of a
constitution and the machinery of government
that shall be representative of the people in
such a democratic manner that everybody, with
an interest in the country, shall be able to avail
themselves of its machinery,” is a mere
nebulous mass of meaningless polysyllables. If
fhe British labor authority would come down
out of these vasty wastes of language and say
exactly what kind of a constitution he thinks
would be a fair thing, how the working-classes
should be consulted, what are the “ repressive
measures,” where the efforts of the constitu-
tion-makers have been directed in the interests
of “ mere property,” how the elections were a
“ triumph of cliqueism,” and a few other
things, he might do some good. With refer-
ence to Federal matters he seems to be a very
hazy windbag, who does his level best to
damage the cause by saying, in long words like
Mesopotamia and Mahershalalhashbaz, that
things are wrong, without indicating where
they are wrong or how they should be made
right.

Unseaworthy Foreigners.
“ A Barrister ” to The Bulletin :
“Phillis,” a “ British ship,”on the ground of its alleged
nnseaworthiness, has drawn attention to a curiousbutvery
proper provision of the Marine Act. It is to the effect
that when a ship has been detained under the Act, she
shall not be released by reason of her ceasing to be a
British ship. As the Phillis has ceased to be a British
ship on account of her sale to a Norwegian since the de-
tention, and as the Yio. authorities refuse to allow her to
have the chance of drowning her crew, the provision in
question is likely to come very prominently before the
public shortly. At first sight it would appear that Vic.
Parliament was totally incompetent to pass such a sec-
tion, dealing as it does with what, in law, is, in this case,
a piece of Norwegian territory ; but as the Act has received
Royal assent as a reserved bill, and as an exactly similar
provision was contained in a British Merchant Ship-
ping Act of 76, it may be taken that the provision is not
ultra vires, but is an assertion by Britain of her right
to compel foreigners sailing from British ports to do so
only in safe and seaworthy vessels. It does not say so
except so far as ships which have been previously detained
as British ships are concerned; but in saying so with
respect to them, it implies the power and the willingness,
if properly urged, to say so with respect to all foreign
ships. Now, this is a power which might very properly
be taken to herself by the alleged “ mistress of the seas,”
and in the interests of both our own and foreign sailors
should be urgently demanded by unions, philanthropic
associations, and other bodies interested in the welfare
of seamen. If the wise English provisions relating to
seaworthiness were made to apply to all ships in Austra
lian and other British waters, we should earn the grati-
tude of imperfectly-protected thousands of foreign sea-
men, to say nothing of the removal of a large part of the
present tendency to make bogus transfers of ships to
other flags in order to escape the humane provisions of
the British Acts. To do this, of course, would be to offend
foreign nations, and to raise diplomatic complications. But
the British Parliament has already studied that phase of
the question or it would not have passed the clause
alluded to. It passed the .clause well knowing that it
meant “ Foreign nations be damned ! We are not going
to let sailors set out in coffin-ships ! ” It is quite possible
that, despite the clear wording of the clause in question,
the Vic. authorities may be bluffed into caving in. But
in such a matter as this, even if the provision were
unconstitutional, there is a clear moral duty on Victoria
to act humanely in a matter like this, and there need be
no fear that if she does so act she will have the civilised
world behind her. Anyhow, there’s the Act, and if Scan-
dinavia doesn’t like it, let her send her navy and rescue
the Phillis from the grip of the Vic. people. British
legislation applicable to the colonies* is generally a
reminder of our dependence, but we’ll be willing to put
up with that a little longer if it is used, as it can be, by
extending such a provision as the one under consideration
for the benefit of the shamefully-abused sailor-folk of
Britain and Europe.
A Federal Customs Swindle.
The position of New South Wales, as the one
Freetrade province of Australia, raises a com-
plex problem which will have to be faced in the
first year of the Commonwealth. Until the
Commonwealth tariff is enacted, the separate
provincial duties will naturally remain in force.
The day the Federal tariff comes into force,
border Customs will cease throughout the
Federation, also Customs duties on goods carried
by sea from one Federal port to another.
Therefore, when the date comes near, specula-
tive merchants will probably pour into Sydney,
and store up there, some millions of pounds’
worth of all kinds of goods which are free
under the N.S. W. tariff. The day the Federal
tariff eventuates the free influx will be stopped.
But, as there will then be no more border
Customs, these goods will be sent by rail
or ship all over Australia, and while the
accumulation lasts they will do much damage
to a number of manufacturing industries.
Also, as this accumulation will pay no duty, it
will make a ghastly hole in the first year’s
Federal Customs revenue ; in quite a number
of lines there will probably be next to no
imports at all, and as a result practically no
Customs revenue, for months. If theN.S.W.
merchants alone did the trick it would matter
less, as the profits wmuld at least remain in the
country, but the market will probably be also
swamped by speculative consignments from
traders in England, Germany, America, and
elsewhere. Another complication is that Mel-
bourne, Adelaide and Tasmanian merchants,
when the Federal tariff is about due, will pro-
bably export all they ban spare of their stock
of duty-paid goods to Sydney, collect drawback
on them at the port of shipment, land them
free in Sydney, and then, when the tariff comes
in force and interprovincial duties are abolished,
ship them back again to their own cities and
land them free as goods imported from a place
inside the Commonwealth. This will mean
another loss of Customs revenue, and no one has
yet presented any promising remedy. Premier
Turner proposes that N.S. W. should adopt a
Protective tariff a year before the Federation
begins, but, as the N.S.W. majority intends
instead doing its best to make the whole
Commonwealth Freetrade, this idea is natu-
rally received with a whoop of derision.
Another suggestion, which also finds little
favor, is to maintain the interprovincial Customs
for a year after the Federal tariff commences,
so as to confine the speculative importer to
New South Wales. Probably the best scheme
of all is to let the speculative importer do his
worst. At the very worst, the Federation will
get over the shock in a few months, and it is a
swindle that can only be perpetrated once.
Nothing great can be done without something
being broken in the doing, or some fraud hap-
pening by way of a side-issue, and Premier
Turner’s inclination to make a large stumbling-
block of this matter is a narrow and parochial
proceeding.
An Odorous Political Matter.
“ Lictor ” from Kalgoorlie, on the fishy Hain-
ault affair :
Dear Bulletin,— Be Hainault. When the bill to re-
habilitate the Hainault lease went before W.A. Upper
House last week, the President ruled that, as private
interests were involved, a select committee should be
appointed to enquire into those interests. Government
accordingly “selected” five members, three of whom are
remarkable for little except their strong J. Bull tenden-
cies, the famous W.A. Minister for Mines also being one.
Although these persons were “selected” to “ take evi-
dence, call for papers,” &c., and enquire into the merits
of the claimants, they didn’t ask to hear those whom
even the Attorney-General called “ the present holders”
—the men who hold the ground under miners’-rights;
and all the “papers” they read were the evidence taken
before the warden at Kalgoorlie, in a case where the
miners’-rights men objected to their ground being granted
to Rutherford, who had since passed out of the conten-
tion. In the case referred to the only evidence brought
forward by the miners’-rights men was what they con-
sidered necessary to oust Rutherford ; no question was
taken as to the position of the Hainault Co., since that
matter was not before the Court. And yet it was on the
reading of this evidence that the committee framed its
report advising the House to pass the Bill; and passed it
was accordingly. Next day (Wednesday) the Premier
moved in the Assembly that the Standing Orders be sus-
pended to allow the Bill to be passed through all its
stages in a single sitting. This course, however, met
with strong opposition. Members urged that, as the case
was then before the Supreme Court, the matter should
be left to that tribunal. The “indecent haste ” manifested
was warmly condemned. The Premier ‘ ‘ assu red the House ”
that the Hainault rent had been paid before forfeiture of
the lease, but that the amount had been credited to an-
other lease through “ an error in the department” ; also
that the clerk who had received the rent “ could not be
found just then.” He did not say that the books had dis-
appeared also!!!!!!! Mr. Moran had given notice of
motion to produce the books and papers, but his request
was simply brushed aside. On division, the House refused
to supply the majority necessary to suspend the standing
orders. Next day (Thursday) there was to be a two-hours’
sitting, and the House was then to be prorogued—sug-
gestive word! During the Wednesday night the
Minister interviewed honorable members. Next morn-
ing, the House met, good-humored jokes were passed
from side to side ; the Premier thanked the Opposi-
tion in anticipation for what they were about, to do ;
the arguments of the previous night against “ indecent
haste ” were forgotten ; no further discussion took place ;
the bill was passed through all its stages in a few
minutes, and is now law. The Premier had previously
promised the House that “reasonable compensation”
should be offered “the jumpers,” and he has since
tendered them £5OO and costs —this, after collaring
from them a property worth £lOO,OOO. Hon. mem-
bers played to J. Bull in the gallery, and spoke
earnestly' about “ honor and good faith” —very suggestive
of a man singing a hymn while running off with the
church-plate. The Government laid great stress on their
assertion that the forfeiture of the Hainault lease had
occurred through “an error in the department,” as if
that were quite sufficient to justify them in evading their
own responsibilities. The same argument would apply to
a big railway smash, and probably will some da.y. As to
whether the Hainault rent was paid in time—which affects
the equitable, though not the legal, aspect of the case—
I think I can guess under which thimble the pea is.
Anyway, the State is liable, and some day there may be
a Parliament that recognises the moral responsibility of
the province—a responsibility that will remain till justice
be done. Meanwhile, J. Bull is looked to for gratitude ;
but I question whether he will see the matter that way.
One “argument” used in the House against “the
jumpers” was that they were “speculators.” What
about the Hainault Co. itself, which ran the shares up to
£4, then down to 55., and now up to 30s. ? What about
hon. members themselves, who speculate in shares and
beef, &c. ? What about their own J. Bull himself ?
The Worm that Turned.
Nobody was hurt but everybody was a good
deal scared by the bomb which William
Stephens, M.L.A., exploded, the other day, in
Queensland Assembly. The Stephens episode
was full of anomalies. That amateur dyna-
miter is generally a man of peace, a vigorous
Government supporter, and a hard, consistent
follower of- the mild and the commonplace. He
is understood to have advocated the appointment
of the recent gamey Land Commission, and the
fact that he didn’t get a billet on it surprised
everybody—probably including Stephens him-
self. Despite this disappointment he re-
mained a cordial supporter of the firm of
Tozer and Co. The Land Commission lived,
and smelled badly, and drew its fees, and died,
and was buried, and still Stephens, M.L.A.,
made no sign. On this particular night he was
acting as Government whip, and was the same
consistent admirer of Tozer and co. as of yore
—right up to the last moment. Then an
astonished House saw its patient Gibeonite get
up, apropos of absolutely nothing, and denounce
the Commission as a “clumsy, wilful, and un-
dignified attempt at political corruption.”
Having uttered this roar, he waited for
Speaker Cowley to interfere, but as
Cowley was too astonished. to move,
Stephens kept heaving the same mass of
language at his head, till at last he had to sit
up and tell the hon. member to stop. Then
Stephens repeated his language, and Acting-
Premier Tozer, being brought in apparently
against his will, moved that the worm which
had turned should be “ suspended ” for 24
hours. The House voted against Tozer, so it
either meant that it endorsed Stephens’ re-
marks about political corruption, or that it
approved of the spectacle on general principles,
and wanted the row to continue. Then Tozer
sat down under the insult for some days, and
apparently he would be sitting down
neacefully under it yet, only the organs
of his party told him be must rise
and repudiate the charge, and clear his
character, and so forth. Soafter a week’s interval
the Government rallied up its majority one
evening and voted that Stephens’ charges were
wholly unfounded. Stephens said nothing on
this occasion, barring a few interjections ; he
wasn’t ejected or suspended or anything; the
Government simply passed a motion as quietly
as possible declaring its own spotless purity,
and it didn’t harry the worm that turned into
any serious attempt to prove his statements.
And why its long and patient supporter, after
keeping the peace for nine years, got up and
exploded all in an instant as he did has never
been explained.

Ben Tippett’s account of that “Queen’s
Health ” episode, at the Melb. Trades Hall
banquet, is not very satisfactory. At Ballarat,
last week, little Benjamin said : “ When the
loyal toast was proposed everybody thought the
toast was to him. When the thing was even-
tually understood he spoke with the greatest
respect and heartiness, because the Queen was a
woman and a mother. He rallied the company
in the cheeriest words possible, and as he was
resuming his seat he said, ‘Yes, let us
drink to the Queen or any other old
lady.’” Isn’t this a weak evasion of the
main point? The Queen was toasted as a
monarch, not a mother. Tippett should have
stood at the time, and should stand now, on his
right to be always antagonistic to the Queen in
her much-toasted capacity. If Tippett is
superior to the folly of Queen-worship, which is
the religion of the classes who over-rule the
masses, he can’t honestly revere the Heir
Apparent’s mother. As for her being a woman,
well, she comes naturally into the unpolitical
toast of “ The Ladies, Gorblessem ! ”
The proposal to leave the financial question to
be settled by the Federal Parliament rouses
John Haynes, M.L.A., to fury. “Our cup is
full,” wails John in a letter to the Herapd ;
“ The people of N.S.W. are to surrender to a
Parliament in which they must stand as a
minority as of four to one such questions as the
finances, the capital, the tariff, the railways.”
The poor provincial John can’t realise that the
other provinces also have to surrender exactly
the same questions, and each one of them will
be in a worse minority, so far as representation
is concerned, than N.S.W. If five provinces
federate it would seem that they must all be in a
minority of four to one—just as John Haynes,
while he lives in N.S.W., must be in a minority
of 1,300,000 to one. Yet the huge majority
has never taken advantage of its power to
oppress the minority of one Haynes, or passed
special legislation against him, and it is just
possible that the Federal majority will be
equally fair in its dealings.
In the case of David Feapy, solicitor, of
Sydney, who was recently called upon to
answer allegations which, if they were true,
amounted to a charge of subornation of perjury,
N.S. Wales Supreme Court gave a very un-
satisfactory decision. David Feapy, though
tacitly relieved of the burden of the accusa-
tions against him, was “ not exonerated alto-
gether,” and was ordered to pay all costs.
That is, the Supreme Court shirked the specific
question whether the statements made by
Griffen, who alleged that he perjured him-
self at Feapy’s bidding, were true or not; and
merely decided that Feapy acted foolishly.
And now—what is going to happen to Mr.
Griffen, who, according to his own affidavits,
is guilty of perjury? In the public interest,
Mr. Griffen should be taken at his word.
Ben Tippett’s principal financial theory seems
to be that the Fat Men voluntarily broke the
banks in ’93 for sinister purposes of gain.
“ Aafor the breaking of the banks, that was an
old dodge of the capitalists,” is one of his
favorite phrases. Everyone has realised by
this time that the capitalists wrecked their
own banks by running a boom that was pure
lie and steal and robbery. But the idea that
they wanted to break their own banks and stop
receiving dividends, and that any capitalist
deliberately laid himself out to make the sale-
value of his shares go down from many pounds
to nothing, and that Munro was yearning to
sacrifice his big pile and his Agent-General-
ship, and Matthew Davies schemed to lose his
Speakership and his palace at Toorak, and old
C. H. James played a deep game to drop his
estate and be struck for £175,000 calls, is very,
very steep. The capitalist in many cases is
plain, unvarnished ass, and of such was the
Australian bank-boomer in very many cases.
But the school to which Tippett belongs re-
gards him with child-like faith as an intellectual
demi-god of the worst kind, and as it can’t
understand how he could have been such a
fool as he was just before ’93 it assumes that he
broke his banks voluntarily so as to make
money by losing his property, and being sold up,
and—in some few cases—getting into gaol. The
capitalist came out all right, according to
Tippett, though “ the workers lost all their
little savings.” But the capitalist was struck
by a demand for seven millions in calls, and out
of the £90,000,000 of little savings which were
“re-constructed” the biggest part were his
own. He was only a blundering, clumsy,
mendacious, grabbing fool, after all, and when
his institutions came down on top of his thick
head no one was more astonished than himself.
In most cases he hadn’t even the sense to see
that they were coming down till it was too late
to escape with a decent amount of his plunder.
Charpes Happ, the Eaglehawk miner, made a
desperate attempt to dodge the hangman by
“confessing” that, he only half-murdered his
wife. Happ’s narrative stated that he first of
all ducked his poor little woman’s head in the
fatal tub. “ Her head went under the water.
She got her head out, but she fell back again.
She again got her head out, but again fell
back.” Then Happ — vide “ confession ”
lifted the wife of his bosom from out the tub,
and she rolled over on the floor. He told the
inanimate body that she had better go back to
bed now that her temper was cooled, and after
imparting this wholesome advice Mr. Happ
went into the kitchen to dry his hands. Re-
turning to the bedroom he was surprised
to find his wife lying where he had
left her. The narrative goes on to re-
cord sundry appealing exclamations uttered
by Hall when he found his wife getting no
better. At last, said the confessing penitent,
“ the terrible idea rushed to my mind that she
was dead, and I cursed myself for my silly
action. . . . Knowing that she had been in the
habit of bathing in the tub, I decided to carry
her out and place her in the tub to make it
appear she had been bathing.” It was a poor
enough yarn, Heaven knows! yet it might
have sufficed to save Hall’s neck if his
beloved barmaid hadn’t previously told a Judge
and jury that the man prattled of wife-murder,
in connection with the tub, weeks before the
fatality came to pass. So the statement which
he laboriously put together in his dungeon cell
merely served the moral purpose of proving,
beyond question, that it was Hall’s best girl
who brought him to the gallows. A (married)
man can’t be too careful in the choice of a best
girl.
Australian “ disloyalty ” may discover food
for meditation in the case <?f one Wilfrid
Charles Rundle, a London solicitor, who was
sentenced to a month’s imprisonment with hard
labor for venting his Jubilee feelings upon a
democratic fellow-citizen. The fellow-citizen
didn’t remove his hat whilst the Jubilee-day
crowd was singing the Hanthem, therefore
Rundle took the law of grovel into his own
hands and smote the stranger on his disloyal
jaw and other places. Rundle, on being
brought before a magistrate, was found guilty
of an unprovoked assault, and he had to do his
month’s oakum-picking in Her Majesty’s gaol.
Supposing that jubilee time were still with us,
what would happen to a solicitor who fell upon
an inoffensive stranger for not baring his head
to “ Gorsave ” in the streets of Sydney or Mel-
bourne ? In the first place, it would be hard to
get the local Wilfrid arrested by the police.
His victim would have to proceed against him
on summons, and meanwhile the victim afore-
said, if it were a Melb. case, would pro-
bably find himself charged with insulting
behaviour. Anyway, Wilfrid would have
the sympathy of the “respectable” daily
press, and Fat Man would intervene on
his behalf, and when the Jubileetic bench had
fined him, say, 405., Wilfrid would march
from court in triumph with his friends to the
vocal strains of “ God Save the Queen.” A
lawyer, in Sydney or Melbourne, is a protected
person who never, or hardly ever, gets sen-
tenced to hard labor for any sort of offence.
Certainly it would be impossible for a battered
republican to enforce the law against a lawyer
in any case where he could plead “ outraged
loyalty ”as an excuse. And this is the point
for local republican sentiment to feel annoyed
about. Australia with its manhood suffrage,
and its labor members, and many other out-
ward professions of democracy, is a less demo-
cratically governed country than England,
where enthusiasm for the Throne is an occasional
weakness rather than a confirmed habit. In
England your (or the other man’s) political
opinions or social rank can help you precious
little when once you get within the grasp of
the law. It is hard, very hard, to get out of
gaol in England.
Vic. Leg. Council made another attempt to
graft a hampering growth of notices of action
and notices of accident on to the poor man’s
rights of action (such as they are) against his
employer. The Vic. Regulation of Mines Act
contained the first provision in the English
legal world, freeing the workman (in mines)
from the operation of the iniquitous and Judge-
concocted doctrine of “common employment,”
and compelled the mineowner to rebut the
presumption of negligence which arose when-
ever a mining accident occurred. This law is
practically ancient history in Victoria. But on
its being consolidated in the present Mines Bill,
the Council inserted conditions similar to those
that make th'e Employers Liability Acts prac-
tically worthless to the poor and those ignorant
of the technicalities of notices of action. And
it was only the fear of their congeners in the
Assembly suffering severely in the mining dis-
tricts in the coming elections that forced them
to let the law remain as it is.
Any lingering doubts as to the law being made
for lawyers, rather than litigants, are now
swept away by the committal of one Nicholls
on a charge of bigamy, heard at Melbourne
City Court last week. The case is probably
unique in matrimonial annals. Nicholls,
having obtained a decree nisi of divorce from
his wife, didn’t settle-up with his solicitor, who
—in the sweet, ordinary way of legal practice—
held the power to take out” the decree after it
was granted, said power being held practically
as security for costs. When Nicholls put in
a formal application “on his own” for his
divorce to be made absolute, the Judge refused
him his legal rights, inasmuch as the receipted
bill of costs was not forthcoming. In short,
the Judge ruled that Nicholls must remain
married to his wife (and she to him, of course)
until he liquidated his lawyer’s claim. A further
application by Nicholls to the Full Court
met with a like refusal. In March
last, which was long after the time when he
would have been absolutely divorced but for
the trouble re costs, Nicholls married again,
whereupon “somebody” laid an information
against the man, and the Crown is now trying
to “pot” him for bigamy. It doesn’t trans-
pire that the original Mrs. Nicholls is married
again on the strength of her husband’s decree
nisi, but she may have found a Number Two,
and in that case the non-payment of his law-
yer’s bill renders her likewise liable to prose-
cution and imprisonment. The Judge who
tries Nicholls for bigamy will surely be bound
to uphold the Full Court’s ruling. The Law
was made for lawyers, and when a client’s inno-

Nobody by any chance came along and
opened a new drama or comedy at Sydney this
week. New dramas or comedies are about as rare
as hens’ teeth nowadays, or as the anthem of the
alligator. Barring variety, and burlesque, and
things with song and dance in them, and edu-
cated mules, and other side issues of the ham-
frill order, there has been practically nothing new
m Sydney for about half-a-year. The theatrical
business just now is all lace and insertion and ice-
cream and high-kick and fritters and other unsub-
stantial things, and if somebody would only arrive
with a good co., and a perfectly new drama
m four indigestible acts and one big explosion, it
would fill a want as big as Mount Kosciusko.
Sydney begins to long for something it can get its
teeth into—not merely a mouthful of flounces,
therefore the promised dramatic season at the
Lyceum comes as a welcome change. Alfred
Dampier opens the ball on Saturday with a very
short spell of “Robbery Under Arms,” which
isn’t exactly new—still it and Dampier together
should crowd the building for their short stay.
This is understood to be the old hero’s farewell to
Sydney, and for the sake of the many good pieces
he has played, and the many good things he has
done, and the better and pleasanter times which
he recalls, he ought to get a goodly welcome. A
new co. and a huge military drama follow Dampier,
and as the prices vary from 2s. to fid., the public
should be able to raise the necessary amo’uit by
leaving the flat-iron at the Mont de Pi4te.
** * *
Maggie Moore’s last week at Sydney Royal
is devoted to the immortal “Struck Oil,” the
ancient city of Oilville being erected on Saturday
night in the presence of a good audience. Harry
Roberts, with the record bad cold on his chest and
in a voice that was reduced to a whisper, dragged
John Stofel manfully, and the latest oil-
strike was a notable success. To-morrow (Friday)
afternoon Miss Vivianne Dagmar, formerly of
the luckless Elsie Adair combination, is to have a
benefit at the Royal. The disaster which struck
that lamented Criterion show and knocked it out
in one round left this lady a beautiful but badly-
stranded stranger in a land which hasn’t even a
reliable sand-shifting job to offer the stranger just
.now; so an effort—which, it is hoped, will be a
highly successful one—is being made to give her a
lift. After the close of Miss Moore’s season the
Royal will be vacant for a fortnight, when George
Rignold takes possession with “In the Ranks.”
** * *
The French Maid,” afc Her Majesty’s,
progresses as indicated in last issue. It is less
substantial than the “ Gay Parisienne ” which pre-
ceded it, inasmuch as the “Parisienne” started
with a definite incident for a foundation, and the
people kicked off each other’s hats for certain
understandable reasons, whereas the “Maid ” is a
cyclone of skirts at the commencement, and re-
mains at that all through, with no visible motive
ft all. The characters simply run to comic riot
because they darned well please to do so. Perhaps
a burlesque is as well without a motive ; it is such
a fluffy insurrection that anything so heavy and
concrete as a reason seems about as much out of
-»lace as a mangle would be. Some of the melodies
from the “Maid” are already beginning to be
howled in the streets, which is a sign that the pro-
duction has caught on. There is a faint whiff of
'he briny deep in it, supplied per medium of the
moral admiral and the British sailors, and some
of the songs are reminiscent of “Pinafore”
The only really painful' thing in the two acts is a
new song by Ernest Shand, with a refrain which
isserts, without any reliable affidavit to support
it, that we “all take off our hats to the Queen.”
Taking off the hat is supposed to be a relic of a
more ancient custom according to which the loyal
subject took everything off in the presence of his
monarch ; but that is a mere detail. Anyhow,
4 he less said about this melancholy Jubilee gibber
fhe better. This country is full of undigested
Jubileo already.
** * *
Two new people, Charles Dillon and Dolly
Eicon, made a mild impression at the Tivoli this
week, but the principal support of that establish-
ment is still the Selbinis, who have hitherto kept
tome hair-raising bicycle feats in reserve, and are
now letting them loose on a staggered planet.
The Palace show goes on as heretofore, barring
the fact that sweet Lilian Tree has been added to
fhe company. Evidently Australia hasn’t for-
gotten its Lilian, for on her appearance the house
blew most of the buttons off its joint and several
weskit with enthusiasm, and when she sang the
“Song that reached my Heart” she plainly reached
the horsey, cricketing', football-corroded soul of
her audience right enough. The rolling years
haven’t damaged Lilian much, and have left no
footprints on her voice, which is as bright and
bell like as ever. There are many kinds of bell,
including the dinner-bell in our boarding-house,
but the above remark is meant kindly, anyhow.
** * *
A thoroughly enjoyable “ function ” is the
N.S.W. Art Society’s annual smoke. Last Satur-
day night’s shivoo was a huge success. The whole
affair was frank, honest, and unconventional.
The usual programme was gone through, with,
mayhap, more than the usual success. The
society is to be congratulated upon having as
President a real, live working artist in the person
of bluff William Lister Lister, and no frilled ham-
joint of a Society man. Think of it, ye cripples
of colonial Mayfair, Lister was actually asked to
retire his claims in favor of—Captain Ferguson,
the Governor’s son-in-law. Reverting to Saturday
night, the event of the evening was undoubtedly
the rendition by Mr. Alfred Hill of his own song,
‘‘The Volunteer Soldier,’’ re-written from Kip-
ling’s verses. Mr. Hallewell and Herr Staedtgen,
and Major Wells, and the Feldwick quartet sang
with generous frequency ; Messrs. Perry, Leon
Pole, G. Taylor, A. R. Coffey, Percy Spence,
Salvana, and others, sketched ; Mr. Edgar Strauss
’eelloed ; and Messrs. Lawrence Campbell and
Harry Leston spoke things ; and everybody else
looked on and smoked, and drank, and applauded.
** * *
At Melbourne Princess’s, the failure of
“ Too Much Johnson ” was succeeded on Saturday
by a rather gigantic success for “Niobe.” A half-
filled house took so kindly to the Paulton-Stanley
combination in this instance that the management
straightway announced “Niobe” for six nights,
instead of three, and if the tide of Australian
prejudice against stolid Paulton and his versatile
companion in neglect can be turned by their pre-
sent performance “Niobe” will carry them into
popularity. Harry Paulton was part, and prin
cipal part, author of the joke. He fitted the
character of Petramos Dunn to himself, and
played it for two years at a stretch. Paulton
interprets the author’s meaning, which now
appears to have been extravagantly cari-
catured by Brough. The other Petramos was
amusing in this part. Paulton’s matter-of-fact
style will seem more amusing to such as find
humor in it, and the humor will be found by all
who feel so disposed. Miss Alma Stanley, as the
reanimated mother of a murdered family, is a
majestiCj hugesome matron, with a sweet voice
and an irresistible pair of arms, and a general
capacity for lengthening and breadthening the
pretty character that Mrs. Brough introduced to
Australia. The new Niobe is the more striking
figure, without doubt. Not quite such an artless,
girly creation as Mrs. Brough’s was, but artless
enough considering her family trials in the long
ago. The real Greek lady was not a spring
chicken, anyway, and her arms were probably
inferior to the outstretched limbs of the Alma
Mater who hailed Petramos Dunn’s relatives on
Saturday night. Cyril Keightley is about the
best item in a weak cast of minor characters, but
“ Niobe ” is a comedy built for two, and the other
people’s shortcomings make no difference in the
result. “In a Locket ” will follow.
** * *
“ The Bookmaker,” at the Bijou, has
been airing his good ’eart and his ’ossiness to
large audiences for the past week or so Thorn-
ton is a favorite under any circumstances, and the
impossible turf-leech in the check-suit makes a
direct appeal to Melbourne’s particular weakness
when he tells the tale of ’ow he onst lifted a norse
fust past the post by a nose, and thereby saved
from destruction a young gent, wot was agoin’
for the gloves. The glamor of that youthful
achievement envelops Thornton’s performance.
For the sake of his having swung his orse round
a nasty turn on two legs a grateful public is ready
to forgive him much. “The Bookmaker” might
have lasted for another week, but the season is
ebbing fast, and “Sweet Lavender” will be
staged on Saturday.
****-
“ In the Ranks,” revived at Mclb. Royal
on Saturday last, is likely to stay there for some
little time. The city has not been overdosed with
this old reliable show—in fact, a large portion of
the city has never yet taken any of Sims’ best
melodrama, and the effect of it, when taken for
the first time, is much better than the average
person anticipated. “In the Ranks ”is not a
garish ewlogy of British valor in foreign parts,
where all the “rebellious” niggers die fighting
for their native precipice, and the only loss on the
Hinglish side is a young recruit who writes a fare-
well message to mother on the colonel’s shirt-cuff.
George Rignold wears a scarlet coat simply
because he can’t afford to buy a plain, ordinary
garment, and he requires the Queen’s uniform to
keep out the cold. As a soldier, he dots nothing
remarkable, beyond escaping from baira ks on a
visit of condolence to his long-lost bride, or some-
thing to that effect. Ultimately, he is bought out
of the army by a penitent uncle'from India, and a
scowling Gideon, who has been heaping calamity
on his head through four long acts, is at last over-
thrown. Also, an apocryphal father of George—
a shabby, unprincipled interloper, with a thirst
that never fails —is proved to be another
parent altogether. “In the Hanks ” con-
tains a pleasing infusion of rural scenery
and a long list of characters, some of
whom pass just a smart remark or two, and go
away as suddenly as they arrived. George
Rignold s robust presence, in the hero capacity,
would be improved by a touch of hair-dye, per-
haps, for then he wouldn’t look as though Gideon
were bringing his grey locks in sorrow to the grave.
Miss Lilian Wheeler is an adorable Ruth through-
out; «J. F. Cathcart plays a strong scene with
Rignold in the first act; Lawrence Dunbar makes
a neat, unaffected captain, and Hazlitt a whole-
some variety of villain, whilst useful work is done
very well by Frank Hawthorne, Stirling White,
and others too numerous too mention. Altogether
a level, easy-going performance of a reasonable
plot.
** * *
The two or three latest additions to the
Opera House bill were well received on Saturday,
and the new company at the Alexandra hang on
to their convict drama as though it were paying
expenses, which it probably isn’t. Nevertheless,
they are a deserving company at the price.
Bracy’s Opera Co., at latest, held the
boards at Perth fW. A ) Theatre Royal, where
“ Beggar Girl,” “Bohemian Girl,” and “Sultan
of Mocha” had been staged to crowded houses,
with Martha,’ “ Nemesis,” and other good
things, to follow. The shapely chorus and ballet
have caused quite a flutter of excitement among
Perth johnnies and remittance-men in general.
Even the typhoid germs were to be heard whistling
the breeziest airs from “The Girl ” and “The
Student,’ likewise the town councillors have
laid up ” all their “ deep draining ” and money-
borrowing schemes until the co. has started back
to the East.
At Poverty Point.
The two clever Majeronis, Mario, the dark and stupen-
dous, who is remembered in Sydney for his clever acting
in a number of small parts, and his rather less stupendous
brother George, are to join the Brough Comedy Co for
its Indian tour.
The Majeronis are quite replicas of their father and yet
more distinguished uncle, who took part in the greatest
representation ever known in Italy, when Madame Ristori,
M.M. Salvini, Rossi, and Majeroni appeared together in
“ b rancisca di Rimini,” at the Dante Centenary. George
Majeroni, in the “Terrors of Paris,” is a startling reminder
of his sire. Madame Ristori takes a lively interest in her
talented nephews, whose Scotch college education, how-
ever, did not intend them for the boards.
Alma Stanley, as Niobe, did more than take Melbourne
by surprise. The statuesque amazon fairly staggered a
lot of people who had been asserting that her voice and
manner were vulgar, and that she couldn’t act a bit.
Henry Burton, the well-known old-time circus-proprie-
tor, is stricken down with paralysis in Melbourne. He is
said t.o be destitute, and a subscription has been arranged
Mr. Burton’s character is of the whitest—a good com-
rade, a generous employer ; honest, energetic, compas-
sionate ; and though it is long since the heyday of his
brave old show there are surely many who well and plea-
surably remember him and it, and will extend a helping
hand to the gallant old ex-king* of the sawdust-ring l . &
Lewis Wingfield told a droll yarn of how he got up a
Lord Mayor’s show. There was to be a pageant called the
Inumph of Beauty, with the Queen surrounded by her
maids-of-honor. Reaching home one afternoon, Lewis
found his housekeeper in a rage. “ Look here, sir 1 the
place is full of ladies of the ballet! There’s three of them
gals in the front room, half-a-dozen in the droring-room
and as many in the dining-room. I didn’t think it proper
to show any into the bedroom, and as for the kitchen I
wouldn’t have none of the hussies there 1”
The latest re Ada Crossley is that, having a tendency
to get fat, she has been advised by Melba to take boxing-
lessons.
Haresfoot: “An incident in the comedy of the “ Book-
maker” was evidently suggested by the life of Sir Joseph
Hawley, the eminent racehorse owner, of Blue Gown and
others. In Italy he fell in love with an English ladv not
knowing she was married. She said to him :* I have a
sister at home, handsomer and cleverer than lam ” On
this hint Hawley posted off to England, and started
courting that lady, ‘as per sample,’ as he said. He mar-
ried her, too. See ‘ Dictionary of National Biography ’
for verification of this incident.”
N. : “ A boxful of chestnuts is being quoted around as
samples of Thespian vanity. The best one is left out.

Dear Bulletin, —Sydney City Council doesn’t quite
clear £'6oo a year from recitals over and above organist
vviegand s stipend. Numerous incidental expenses occur
in connection with lighting, door-keeping, repairs, and
advertising, so that the sum actually netted by the coun-
cil can’t go very far into hundreds.' Also, the aldermen
take advantage of their positions to fill a gallery full of
deadhead friends and relations at every recital—a further
loss to the revenue.—T.D.
It seems that the late Melb. Lyric Club went to its grave
in a clean-winding sheet, after all. The club’s final
operatic outbreak —a creditable performance “ Mar-
jorie,” in which Miss Mabelle Darley (nee Davidson) played
her first, speaking part—resulted in a £2OO loss A call
upon the members brought some £7O for the payment of
needy creditors, and the club thereafter worked itself
free of liabilities by means of open-air concerts at the
M.C.C. ground.
A Mrs. Mellon is advertising in the Melb. papers. “At
home daily—psycho-clairvoyance.”
A Japanese play is the entertainment for realism. There
is not much pretence in symbolism. If there is a murder
in the piece, they will occasionally provide a condemned
criminal, who is killed in full sight of the audience (so
travellers say). At Thursday Island (N.Q.), once upon a
tune a Japanese play was in full season. The white folks
rolled up to see it. The Jap. actor (generally struts and
performs almost " mid codings on,” but, in deference to
the racial stpieamishness of the whites, those actors were
each hidden in a 1% garment like a dressing-gown, but-
toned up to the chin. The white did not appreciate the
delicate compliment, in view of what followed. It was a
il niora l Anglicised, it might have been en-
titled Is mama-re a failure?” Departing from his
cherished traditions of realism, the heavy villain did not
enact the choicest scene as he would have enacted it
before his countrymen ; but he made most violent and
suggestive gestures with an elbowed arm. The whites
began to quit. The Government-Resident was treading
e f-’ ,|n ~"a.v out, behind a lady, who was incautious
enough to give her disgust speech. “ It’s thoroughly dis-
graceful! ’ 11 ) es, it is-ha! ha! ha! ho! he! ho!”
roared Douglas, his necessity of replying having loosened
his power to preserve a befitting gravity.
J.D. : “The last time the Hobart theatre was crowded
every woman in the pit removed her hat —without being
asked. It gave the impression that all the stalls women

headed.
°ne of the Vic. Bisley team describes the road to Epsom
on the day Galtee More won the Derby : “ We saw many
couples who were an exact counterpart of the characters
portrayed on the stajre by Rickards, Lonnen, etc We
were standing outside one inn, studying character' when
a pair arrived in an appropriale vehicle who were the
very ideal of the coster type in their best clothes. They
stopped and made for the inn, and Dan Reilly followed
them to see what they would do. They got a qua. tof
four-half and some hard-boiled eggs, ami came out—the
girl carrying the mixture, and the man carrying the egg's.
1 hey went a few yards down a lane, and sat on the grass
to refresh themselves.”

Dear Bulletin, —He my old friend, “H.P.,” and the
question as to whether G. V. Brooke played at the old
wooden Princess’, Melb., I am too far from the banks of
arra to look up the papers dealing with the matter,
though 36 years have elapsed, my memory is clear upon
the point. Playing at the Princess’, Brooke would not
necessarily be playing against his own house, for when
Edwards and 1- avveett (Rowe) took the management both
Royal and Princess’ were worked together, Fawcett, no
doubt, getting a rental for his house.— J.M.F.
Wildly humorous criticism from Melb. Paunch •
“ Shades of Shakespeare ! Bernhardt as Hamlet! Will
Ophelia wear snappy short frocks and sing hall-marked
music, hall-marked ballads, in the Bernhardtian produc-
tion of the Bard of Avon's masterpiece?” Paunch
evidently confuses Bernhardt with Lottie Collins.
Dear Bulletin,— Another injustice to Ireland. You
say, re Barton M’Guckin, that “ Australia will he glad to
hear the English— -i.e. , Scotch—tenor before he drops into
decay. Barton is English—i.e., Irish. A quarter of a
century or so ago he was principal tenor at Paddy’s Opera
Dublin—called by some archaiologists St. Patrick’s Cathe-
dral. Besides, his nose (tip tilled like the petal of a bed-
room candlestick) proclaims him Irish, short and broad.—
Yours, Eblan. [Yes, he looks Irish, rather than Scotch.

Soucais’educated bears (a late Tivoli attraction) were
put to a novel use at Brisbane Exhibition. Five particu-
larly beauteous barmaids having failed to prove a
“draw,” the bears were placed behind the bar, and a
fickle public came to gaze and remained to drink. Host
O’Connor, by the way, who paid a heap of money for the
right of the refreshment rooms, is said to be the only man
who made money out of Brisbane Exhibition.
The Melb. Alexandra management has had new frosting
done on the ground glass of the stage-door, to obliterate
an inscription, the offence of which was Greek to an out-
sider, hut it gave mortal annoyance to the ladies. Simply
“ Members Only, One Shilling,” traced by an impudent
fore-finger. The occult reference was to the Galvin case,
a talk of the town.
“The Bookmaker,” at Melb. Bijou, will help to bring
the theatre into touch with Kennedy’s ’orse entertain-
ment anon. The dumb animal show will waft its stabular
odours across the footlights in about, five weeks from now.
Bandmaster Hutchinson’s Cantata, “ Federation,” which
underwent so much preparation, is now announced for
performance, at Sydney, on 23rd inst. The setting is for
full chorus and orchestra of patriotic verses by Austra-
lian and British alleged poets, among whom Lady Jersey
and Parkes have been included. The composer himself
will conduct a chorus of 300 voices and an orchestra of
about 70 players.
Pattie Browne has been definitely engaged to appear at
Drury Lane shortly—as a young peeress. The famous
Langworthy case is responsible for the plot of the play,
and there is to be much spectacular display.
Miss Winifred Dibbs (daughter of the general manager
of the Commercial Banking Co. of Sydney), who was one
of Staell s most accomplished pupils, has been taken
in hand by Prof. Remy, of Paris Conservatoire. The
latter, who hardly ever accepts private pupils, has for
once broken his rule, ow ing, it is said, to Staeil’s good
offices and the lady’s exceptional promise.
H. : “ Mrs. Harrison Lee is coming before the public as
an entertainer. Mrs. I,ee’s show is cinematographic. The
dames of the W.C.T.U. think it a come-down, but Mrs.
Lee says she is under the unpleasant necessity of dining.”
H. : “A curious recollection of old Melbourne is the
gondola. James Ellis, a restless speculator, who estab-
lished Cremorne Gardens in London, also founded them
in Melbourne. He had a notion that a fortune could be
made by running gondola steamers on the Yarra. He
built one by the Upper Yarra, opposite Toorak. It had a
rudder at each end, to avoid turning, and there was a
mighty corroboree over the launch. Afterwards Cre-
morne fell into the possession of Coppin and Brooke.”

It appears that the rumor alluded to in last
week’s Bulletin that the committee of investigation had
presented a more or less horrifying further report about
the condition of the Queensland National Banlc was un-
founded, no report being yet presented. Therefore a
perfectly new joke to the effect that the institution
should henceforth be called the Queensland National
Blank, as a condensed way of describing the prospects of
the shareholders, misses fire.

The Federal Coffee Palace (Melbourne) for the
year ended 31st July, 1897, realised a profit of £1237.
The capital has been written down from £129,112 to
£19,122 (£86,063 being written off building alone), and of
this only £12,763 is paid up, so the Federal is now earn-
ing nearly 16 per cent, on its reduced capital. If it had
kept at the original figure it would have been earning a
trifle less than 1 per cent. Still things are much better
than they were. For years it kept losing money till it
piled up a debit balance of over £16,000, and any kind of
a profit is a change for the better. If only the long-post-
poned whisky-license comes along, and a beauteous bar-
maid dispenses blue ruin on the premises, the old coffee-
institution should boom again,

Brisbane Permanent Building- and Banking Go.,
which reconstructed in the black days of 1893, is releasing
the last of its deposits. It owed £229,880, and by its
reconstruction agreement it pledged itself to pay up
within six years with interest at the enormous rate of
6 per cent. The Brisbane Permanent is one of the few
institutions which carried their load successfully to the
bitter end, and it paid up its 6 per cent, to the last.
Last year, under the first instalment of Free-
trade, the N.S.W. soap imports were double those of 1895,
and the candle imports increased one-half. The local
manufactures dropped in almost exactly the same pro-
portion and 106 employes—about a fourth of the whole
number in the business—were discharged. Melbourne
Age publishes an interview with a N.S.W. soap-and-
candle manufacturer who says that the business is going
to perdition, and the Argus comes out on the other side
with an interview from another soap-man—the re-
cently-established Sydney representative of the Eng-
lish firm of Lever Brothers—who says the soap
and candle business is simply on the topmost pin-
nacle of a great and glorious boom, or words to that effect.
Meanwhile it is announced that the directors of the
Sydney Soap and Candle Works at Newcastle are shutting
down their candle-making department for an indefinite
period in order to work off the surplus stock which has
accumulated owing to the glut of imports, and 60 more
men are thrown out of work. Altogether, the English
representative person seems to have the evidence heavily
against him.

After four days’ hard legal argument at great
expense, Vic. Full Court gave its sanction to the forma-
tion of an Assets Co. under British management to liqui-
date the remains of the Federal, City of Melbourne, Mer-
cantile, and English and Australian Mortgage Banks.
The new arrangement means that there will be a board
of about half-a dozen lawyers to pay in England and an
English office to keep up, while the Australian expenses
must go on very much the same, the assets being here.
The properties will be under the control of the London
board, which never saw them and knows next to nothing
of their value. Theenormous law-expenses comeout of the
assets, also there will be a big item for stationery and other
things. Theonegreatadvantageof the British management
is that it is going to issue 3 per cent, debentures to the
creditors—the Briton’s yearning to issue debentures being
absolutely unquenchable. The" assets won’t be any more
valuable, and the creditors won’t get any more out of
them through the issue of debentures. The only differ-
ence is that where a creditor would have got ss. in the £
dividend under the old system, he will get 4s. 9d. dividend
and 3d. interest under the new one. Chief Justice Madden
decided in effect that the scheme was a piece of compli-
cated foolishness, but, as the shareholders had accepted
it, the Full Court seemed to have no option in the matter.
The scorn which Madden, C.J., heaped on the 3 per cent,
debentures might not be exactly law, but it was remark-
ably good horse-sense.

Under the present N.S.W. Municipal Act rates
are chargeable, not on the actual value of property, but
on the nominal rental. Therefore, the rich man who has
a large piece of vacant land which he is holding for a
rise nominally lets it, perhaps to an obliging relative, at
next to nothing per annum, and that rental fixes
the rates. One Sydney suburban council states, as an
example, that a piece of land with 700 ft. of frontage to a
main road pays 7s. 6d. a year in rates. And for this
7s. 6d. the borough has to maintain 700 ft. of pavement
and gutters, and to do scavenging, lighting and general
supervision as well. Consequently a demand for power
to charge rates on the value, not the rental, is setting in
strongly.

Even the S.M. Herald, which usually takes
things as they come, rose up quite suddenly last week to
endorse The Bulletin’s contention that the glowing-
returns given in the N.S.W. Railway Commissioners’
reports are wholly unreliable, Among other things, the
Herald complains that no allowance is made for interest
on borrowed money sunk in railways in course of con-
struction, which is a perfectly true bill, though it applies
to some other provinces as well as N.S.W. Apart from
this, it objects to the “ misstatement annually of the cost
of the debt,” and, as the department puts down the
amount of money borrowed for railway and tramway
purposes the amount on which the department
should pay interest —at some millions less than the
figure mentioned by the Auditor-General there should be
a pretty bad misstatement somewhere. For instance, the
railway and tramway capital in 1896 was under
£39,000,000 according to the Commissioners, while ac-
cording to the Auditor-General it was £44,351,490. Then
there is more trouble over the rate of interest, where,
also, the two narratives fail to hang together, and over
expenses which one authority reckons in and the other
apparently omits. Anyhow, there is a large, aggravating
discrepancy between the alleged good results shown by
the Commissioners and the alleged very bad results shown
by the Auditor-General, and it is a pity that the two
authorities can’t agree a little better.

In Maoriland last year -£854,822 went through
the totalisator, and the Government took 11 per cent, on
this, equal to £12,822. The racing clubs made a clear
profit of over £64,000, so, out of the 10 per cent, deducted,
the State gets U per cent.; the clubs about 7£ per cent.,
and 1 per cent, goes in expenses. When the tote is legalised
throughout Australia, The Bulletin’s idea of a fair deal is
1 per cent, for expenses and the rest to be divided between
the State and the horse magnates —4£ per cent, each. On
that basis the machine would yield about £40,000 a year
in Maoriland, and probably about £70,000 in N.S.W. or
Victoria. The present division is entirely one-sided.
The recent discoveries of bank-note forgeries in
Sydney draw attention to the actually insignificant
amount of crime of that class standing to the debit of
Australia. The Parramatta forgeries discovered in 1873
are the only big ones on record. And yet forgery of
banknotes was the crime for which scores of English
criminals were sent to Botany Bay.

The N.S.W. Railway Commissioners have fixed
the “ specially” low rate of id. per ton per mile for the
carriage of mineral ores in truck-loads. Owners of mines
in the far west —and the bulk of ores are coming that way
—would be better pleased with a sliding scale for long
distances. It seems hardly fair that ores travelling 500
miles should pay the same mileage rate as those only
running 50.

Melb. Herald, which has hitherto consistently
upheld the justice of the Salvation Army’s pauper com-
petition with the legitimate firewood and toy traders, now
lashes out furiously at the Army’s audacity in daring to
go into the more profitable and better-advertised bike and
tea trades. The Bulletin is wondering, in a casual sort
of way, why the firewood and toy trades never no make
their whereabouts known in print, and is also endeavour-
ing to derive some great moral lesson from the Herald’s
sudden change of front.

The Queensland Railway Commissioners, unlike
their Southern brethren, are going to stand no nonsense
from the much-paragraphed scalping bogey. The repre-
sentatives of Southern ticket-brokers had only just estab-
lished themselves in Brisbane when one of them was
promptly fined ; also two constables, a railway official,
and a search-warrant managed to secure and confiscate
some 70 tickets, to the value of close on £3OO, in the
agents’ offices. This has squelched the “ outside ” traffic
in railway-tickets up North—where the fine for unauthor-
ised sale has been raised from £5 to £2Ol

A Sydney chemist has, it is said, found out how
to easily and cheaply extract methyl from white spirit.
Hitherto it has been supposed that when alcohol had
been methylated it had been rendered quite unfit for
human consumption. Now it is being treated and used
for essences, perfumes, and medical extracts, and no one
suspects that methyl had ever been near it. The struggle
to reclaim methylated spirit has long been proceeding in
Australia. The present writer has, on several occasions,
distinctly recognised in alleged whisky dispensed at city
groggeries the painty taste and odor of methylated spirit.

“ Yerax ” asks The Bulletin :
(1) Is it true that the supply of sulphides in sight at
the (a) Broken Hill Proprietary Co., (b) British Broken
Hill, (c) Broken Hill Block No. 10, is practically inex-
haustible?
(2) The estimated quantities at each mine?
(3) What do the sulphides assay?
(4) Are the present methods of extraction successful,
and what is the percentage of loss?
It is impossible to give a plain yes or no to most
of these questions. The supply of (a) sulphide ore in at
least the B.H. Prop, and Block 10 is practically inex-
haustible. It all depends upon the price of metals
whether there is much or little of that ore payable.
Estimates of quantity are for the same and other reasons
valueless. Also, the quantity of payable quantity de-
pends upon the progress of metallurgical science. What
can be said positively is this : that the body was tapped
in Block 10 at 1200 ft. or so. The width of the lode at
that depth is uncertain, but it most likely varies from
120 ft. to 10ft.—that is the variation at the upper levels,
and there is no appearance of a pinching. B.H. Prop,
has only prospected to about 700 ft. Its management has
not made an estimate of the quantity in the mine. (It
should have been said that the sulphides begin at from
300 ft. to 500 ft., according to position along the lode). The
B.H. Prop, has three 40-acre blocks, surveyed square, on
the line; Block 10, one; British, one, and a second
block of about 58 acres. Whether the latter
block has much lode remains to be seen. Com-
paratively little prospecting has been done on this
British property; attention has been given mostly to
repairing a very big collapse and working carbonates.
Sulphides vary in assay value. B.H. Proprietary has cer-
tainly hundreds of thousands of tons that contain 20 per
cent, lead, 16oz. silver, and 20 percent, zinc ; it may have
millions. Block 10 has vast bodies (again it is impossible
to be anything but indefinite) that contain 22 per cent,
lead, 250 z. silver or more, and 22 per cent, zinc—a low
estimate. British sulphides are higher in lead, lower in
silver. But, again, this isn’t much of a guide, for
tractabilit.v is another element in calculating values. Thus,
if the zinc is in very intimate association with
the silver, much of the latter is rejected with
the zinc. The process of treatment now is a
preliminary concentration, then a roasting, then smelt-
ing ; or, if there are carbonate ores in plenty to blend with
the concentrates, the roasting may be dispensed with.
The object of the concentration is to get the zinc away
from the lead. With the zinc about 50 per cent, of the
silver and from 6 to 10 per cent, of the lead goes; also, of
course, the silica and other gangue. Whether that is
“ lost ”or not is doubtful; for zinc is more valuable than
lead, but, as it is also very costly to operate, and as this
part is weighted with the gangue, it is practically value-
less to-date. Only Block 10 has done anything on a
marketable scale with this portion of the product; others
are experimenting,
* * , *
The B.H. Prop, smelting furnaces on the mine
will be run down gradually during the next two or three
months (this was written before the fire broke
out in the mine on Sunday last). The Tarrawin*
gee flux quarries will then have lost all their value.
Already 13 of the leases have been forfeited for non-pay-
ment of rent. What shall be done with the 50-mile rail-
way line remains unsettled ; there is a little wool and
wood traffic, but not nearly enough to keep the concern
going.
* * * *
B.H. Extended shareholders met in Adelaide
the other day, and were treated to the customary vision
of the promised land. But they were more interested in
the announcement that attempts were being made to hook
J. Bull.
• * * *
Reckoned that, with silver at 2s. and lead at
even £l3, B.H. British product is worth a small fraction
more than it was at last half-year’s average prices—2s. 6d.
for silver and £ll ss. for lead. Every £1 above £l3 for
lead means an extra profit of £5OO fortnightly.
In connection with the fall in the price of silver,
it is to be remembered in making any calculations of the
effect upon the B.H. mines, that ore-buyers usually deduct
a certain quantity of silver per ton for losses, especially
if there is any intractable constituent —zinc, for instance.
B.N. North concentrates assay about 68 per cent, lead,
9oz. silver, and 8 per cent. zinc. If any silver at all in
this material is paid for, it is not 90z., but 4oz. at most;
so that the loss to the co. through the fall is proportion-
ately reduced.
Apart from the Broken Hill Prop., which suffers
very severely from the silver fall —in other words, the rise
for lead doesn’t compensate it for the fall in silver
about the w'orst trouble is likely to result from the blow
given to the treatment of what have been called zinc-
tailings. Roughly speaking, 90 per cent, of the lead and
just less than 50 per cent, of the silver are contained in
the concentrates proper; 50 per cent, of the silver and 80
per cent, of zinc are in the zinc-tailings. It was in the
treatment of the latter that most experiments were lately
being made ; and Block 10 had shipped large quantities
to German works. Naturally the very big percentage of
silver in this material helped largely to make its
treatment profitable, though the profit has never been at
all large. Now, unless the zinc market hardens very
much, the “tailings” heaps mu3t continue to expand and
be nothing but cumbering refuse.

The fire at Block 13, Broken Hill Proprietary
mine, which broke out on Sunday morning, and suffo-
cated three of the working-party sent below to subdue it,
seems to be located at time of waiting, after severe suffer-
ing bv the workmen engaged in fighting the flames.
Meanwhile, all the works are closed down, and there is a
big slump in shares.

So far the N. Nymagee alleged copper-mine is a
mere shadow, a mere gambling-counter, yet what big
business has been done in it! One Sydney broker alone
claims to have pocketed £2OOO commission in handling
the stock. The mining tipster who has been booming it,
when appealed to the other day, publicly recommended
N. Nymagee shares (at 6s. 6d.) in preference to Burra
Burra (at 2s.)—though, so far, N. Nymagee isn’t a mine at
all, but simply a piece of ground with nothing in sight
but scrub and scrip—and most likely plenty of calls to
follow. This North Nymagee business has gone so far as
to be now regarded as a huge joke. After a puff of North
Nymagee, the tipster remarks: —“ Shares of the Burra
Burra Go. came into some notice. We should v'ish this
company had more funds at its disposal, and had proved
its mine to possess the permanent lodes necessary for
success when dealing with a copper proposition.” Ye
gods! And how much funds has N. Nymagee —and who
on earth knows whether it has the lodes (permanent or
other) necessary for, &c., &c. ?

In another column appears the prospectus of the
Klondyke Prospecting Association of Australia, which is
forming in Melbourne (of course in Melbourne) “ to ac-
quire and work auriferous ground in the Klondyke dis-
trict." S. B. Bagiev and Co., of 408 Collins-street, Mel-
bourne, are the brokers, and 200 shares are offered to the
public at £lO each. Also, at the moment of writing,
there appears a cablegram to the effect that the Yukon
River has frozen over, and the conveyance of supplies by
this route has consequently stopped till about next May.
As the Yukon is a fast-flowing river of immense size, this
means a powerful freeze. It is further cabled that there
is famine at Dawson City, and £lOOO are alleged to have
been given for a sack of flour and a small quantity of bacon.
Evidently the Klondyke Prospecting Association can’t do
much real work till next May, though, if it could strike
some workable scheme of getting bacon to Dawson City
per balloon, it might fill in the winter profitably and
declare dividends of about 2,000,000 per cent. The
Canadian Pacific Co., it is announced, intends building a
line to the Yukon —some day. With the eye of faith The
Bulletin sees that line in the far distance, with the
express arriving at Iceberg City on a winter night and
discharging torrents of steam to try and scald the polar
bear off the platform so that the passengers can get out
and have some hot coffee and boiled fox.

The White Pass, which only 50 out of 5000
prospectors have succeeded in crossing, is the easiest
entrance to Alaska from the east, being 1060 feet lower
than the Chilkoot, at top whereof is a quarter-mile climb,
during which the slightest slip would mean kingdom-come.
One way and another, the gold-god is pretty certain of a
big harvest of victims over this Klondyke craze.
* * » *
The Bulletin observes some difference in the
conduct of the Klondyke boom by that noble institution,
the great Australian press. In one column we read of the
great quantities of gold taken out by individual diggers—
names and quantities given. In another appear cables
showing how many thousands of men and animals are
blocked, that disaster is pending, that the gold-yields
have been grossly exaggerated, and that certain big news-
paper correspondents say so. It was not that way in the
W.A. boom. The Australian press was better played
upon in the interests of the boomsters of that province.
Of course the prospectus of the Klondyke Prospecting
Association is out—in Melb. Only one-third of the entire
capital is wanted by the promoters. “ The services of
two men have already been secured and, immediately
upon registration, they will proceed to this wonderful
field.” How very modest not to ask for a little cash 1
When one remembers the fate of the W.A. prospecting
syndicates, the wonder is how and where they find men
enterprising enough to put up money for advts.

Auckland (M.L.), as was here predicted months
ago would be the case, is feeling very tired : too much
boom and a very heavy baby. It’s just as hard to pick the
Cup-winner as to name the exact date when certain bull-
john mines will have their first crushing.
Waihi mine, M.L.’s chief bullion-producer to
date, has put out ore valued at £571,195 : Aug. crushing,
3120 tons —£11,668. 160,000 shares ; last quote, £7 10s.
Body of reef 30ft. thick. The mine never looked better,
and the block of stone now being met with in No. 2
Martha Lode, once thought absolutely barren, is the
cause of much jubilation among local shareholders. The
reduction-works, in course of erection at Wharoa, include
200-head of stamps.
Waitekauri, another mostly-Bull-owned M.L.
mine. Last crushing, 1841 tons, £5462. Difficult ore to
treat. The experiments being made to discover a less
expensive reduction process are resulting in partial
success.

Waihi, Silverton, 1000 tons, £1398 bullion ; Kapai-Ver-
mont, 260 tons, £580; Woodstock, 1000 tons, £2758 :
Hauraki, bullion valued at £1546 ; Kuranui, Caledonian,
490 tons, £876 ; Waiotahi, 135 tons, £506. (South Island):
Achilles, 484 tons, £1894; Morning Star, 324 tons for
5340 z. gold.
Crown mine (M.L.) has declared a div. of Is. a
share, and ore reserves are large enough to anticipate re-
gular divs. Last crushing, 1200 tons for £3300 bullion.
Talisman, Upper Thames (M.L.) putting
through 1000 tons first crushing. Result not through at
time of writing. Boomsters expect ore to value £6 a
ton ; writer thinks £3 10s. more likely. Question
whether body of stone is metallic enough for the plates of
a 20-head battery.
Preservation Inlet, Morning Star mine, Otago

Maoriland, is probably the most obstinately expensive
mine to drag gold from in Australasia, outside of W.A.
Water the trouble. Cost of working, 17dwt. gold per ton

For the first half-year of '97 the yield of gold

The petition for the winding-up of the West
Australian (gold district) Trading Corporation was being
inquired into when the last English mail left. This co‘.
took over the affairs of the W.A. (gold district) Trading
Syndicate. A certain O. D. N. Grant was sent out as
manager, and shortly after he arrived he suggested busi-
ness in galvanised-iron. Three months before any ship-
ment came, however, he received this coded cablegram
“There will be a meeting shortly, statutory. Suggest
telegraph me (us) as follows: ‘ Transactions are enor-
mous. Continue shipments steadily ; expect profit to be
£25,000.’ ” To which he replied :—“ Yesterday I received
a cable from you suggesting that I should actually tele-
graph a deliberate misstatement of facts to blind the
shareholders. You know full well the ‘ transactions are
enormous’ is utterly false. How can they be when no
goods have arrived ; and even if they had I have no
money to pay dock charges.” The managing director
denied to the court that he had ever sent the cable mes-
sage; but he admitted that the prospectus on which the
corporation was formed (Major - General Tulloch was
hooked, among others) stated that the syndicate had
“ declared a dividend at the rate of 100 per cent, per
annum,” whereas all the profits were “ only anticipated,”
no substantial trading having actually been done ; also
that at the first meeting of the corporation he had told
the shareholders that £60,000 worth of goods had been
shipped, whereas, in reality, syndicate and corporation
together had shipped only £27,000 worth. Enquiry ad-
journed.

During the first week of Sept, five different

in possession.

Tub Bui, mot in is told, a lode formation from 4 to 14ft.

It has all the appearance of being a good property.

From Kanowna, W.A. : Just come in from the
Gordon, where things are very sick, and likely to stay so
for this year at least. Owing, I suppose to the parent
mine’s poor crushing they all seem to have lost heart; out
of five mines that were at work only one (the Extended)
is doing anything, and there are but three men on it.
The main lode seems to be done altogether ; the Gordon
is getting six months’ exemption, the Gordon North three
months, and the Gordon South is also applying. At
Mulgarrie, nine miles from the Gordon, there are 130poor
devils waiting for the Hit or Miss to start; in fact, labor
matters are not rosy just now. At the Great Boulder, a
few weeks ago, as the day-shift was going on I counted
over a hundred men waiting to see if anyone was away, to
get his place ; but now most of the mines about there get
the men to sign a book and wait their turn. And the
wait threatens to be a long one.

“ Cudmore and party’s Little Wonder mine (N.
Coolgardie), though only a small leader, is the most con-
sistent gold-bearer on the field (says a Bulletin corres-
pondent). It has been followed on the underlie to water-
level, about 130ft., and has produced for its owners
£20,000 worth of gold. At water-level they found a
fair-sized reef in the hanging-wall, carrying good gold.”

“The country north of Mt. Malcolm to Earlston
will receive much attention in the near future (writes a
Bulletin correspondent), owing to the number of new
finds, many on formations other than quartz. The great
drawback to successful mining in that region will be the
scarcity of mining-timber and engine-wood, which may
hasten the construction of a railway from Menzies in that
direction.”
* * * *
“ Coolgardie just now (writes an ex-Sydneyite to
The Bulletin) is about the stiffest town for its size in the
island. In this morning’s paper there are no fewer than
nine selling-up advts., most of them in re prominent
citizens. Nearly all the brokers are down at Block 50
rush, dry blowing. The share-market is knocked clean
out, and if the share-exchange sells 500 shares in a day it
is a good day. Unless things get a little more lively
everyone will be off to British Columbia. Adelaide is, of
course, the hub of the Western market.”

Can a man be said to have deserted his
children or left them without sufficient means of
support when they are taken away from him under
a Divorce-court order, and handed over to the
custody of other people? Such is the question
pending in a Vic. Court. When the Acts now in
force in Vic. and N.S.W. re the support of
deserted and destitute wives and children were
passed, “ voluntary ” desertion was clearly in the
view of the Legislature, and not the “ compul-
sory” desertion involved in a custody-order.

Lecturing on the wrongs of children, Miss
Rose Scott ventured on delicate ground when
she reminded a Sydney audience that “ the chil-
dren of thieves and persons with stains on their
characters were liable to inherit these traits from
their parents.” Recalls Charles Lamb’s queries
when writing, long ago, to a friend in Sydney
(Judge Barron Field, wasn’t it?) —“ Is there much
difference between the son of a thief and a grand-
son ? Where does the taint stop ? Do you bleach
in three or in four generations ? ”

Almost a “ record ” in child’s bush-
wanderings has been put up by a little six-year-
old girl between Mossgiel and Cobar. Lost from
a bush pub. on a Monday morning, she was found
on Saturday afternoon in the back-country of
Marfield station. It is reckoned that she had
covered 90 miles, and had lived largely on gum, a
lump of which she was chewing when a black-

One “Reformed recently sent Premier
Reid £3—“of which I am very sorry to have de-
frauded the Government.” Curious that it’s only
the twopenny-halfpenny peculator who ever is
sorry to the cashing-up point. Nobody ever heard
of “ notes for the £5OO of which we regret to have
defrauded the Customs,” or of “ herewith £lOOO,
approximate difference between value of stuff I
contracted for and stuff I supplied.” “Con-
science ” isn’t apparently able to get much above

The recent Christian Endeavour Conven-
tion in Sydney was desperately funny in spots.
One of the societies, it was announced, “supports
a Bible-woman locally, and a child in India.”
Whose? Another society “collects eggs laid on
Sunday for distribution to the poor.” Presum-
ably because the Sabbath-breaking hen-fruit is an
accursed thing, and fit nutriment only for the
pauper un regenerate.

A recent Sydney churcli-robbery case sug-

who, a good while ago, received for a like offence
the outrageous sentence of 15 (?) years from a Vic-

had been broken into? But that was for “sacri-
lege ” ; the Sydney offender was committed
simply for “breaking and entering.” It moves !

A story of the prowess of a certain lady
art-union canvasser. She called on the Chief
Justice— Bulletin doesn’t say which C.J. —
and got three guineas out of him. Then she
went to Mr. Justice Blank, and said that
(say) Billy (using the Chief’s Christian name
with great unction) “has given live guineas, but,
of course, I can’t expect as much as that from
you.” Judge Blank immediately planked down
five guineas. Then she returned to the Chief, and
told him what she had said to Blank, hoping that
he would not betray her. “I don’t know,” said
the Chief, “I have been brought up to regard
absolute truth as a very sacred thing indeed, and
I really could not back up an absolute falsehood.”
“ There is one way in which you need not back up
a falsehood. Give me two guineas more, and you
will redeem my veracity.” Whereupon the Chief
bought the extra two guineas’ worth of chances.

Melb. Evening Herald is becoming a
cheerful paper. A picture of a gory corpse is a
regular thing whenever a murder takes place, and
the older and gorier the corpse is the more promi-
nence the drawing gets. But the other day the
Herald even surpassed itself by giving an illus-
tration of a tumor removed from a woman’s
stomach at Melb. Hospital, said tumor consisting
of pieces of hair bitten off and eaten by the
patient. Same week the Weekly Times, issued
from the Herald office, gave a photo, reproduc-
tion of the frost-bitten feet of a man lost on the
Alps, just prior to amputation. It’s something to
be thankful for that papers issued from the
Herald office aren’t published in time to be read
at breakfast.

The one touch of humor connected with

phed by the foreign element. The ingenious
Russian’s proposal to obtain justice by getting the
whole body of the unemployed to lie prone on the
Collins-street pavement aiid refuse to shift not
having been accepted, a Dutchman propounded
the next scheme. “ I tell yous, boys,” he said,
“Ve vill see de Mayor, and,” with an air of pro-
found wisdom, “ve vill get vork. Venlvosin
de United Stades in ’B4, ve vos vidout vork, und
ve sees de Mayor. Ve says, ‘Here is a lomp-post
and here is a rope, ve vaut vork ’; und I tells you,
boys, in tree days we vas all vorkin in de gutters,
cleaning the grass oud.” But even the spectacle
of Mayor Strong trembling before ten feet of hemp
failed to arouse the unemployed to action, and
the Dutch scheme was east aside like the Russian.
It is whispered to The
Bulletin that, in conse-
quence of the doubts ex-
pressed by this blasphemous
paper as to the chivalry of
the N.S.W. Dept, of Al-
leged Justice, Offended dig-
nity has ukased that no red-
covered rag is on any pre-
tence to be admitted within
the four walls of any gaol

strictly enjoined not to
touch, taste, or handle the

M‘Gr. : Adversity
makes us acquainted with
strange occupations. I was
passing through a small
street in North Fitzroy
(Vie.), last week, when a
draggle - trailed woman
rushed into the street, paced
by a red headed urchin of
about 10. Screeching male-
dictions all the way, she
caught up with the fugitive
at her front gate, and pro-
ceeded to wallop the recalci-
trant youngster. But the
boy wasn’t of the sort to
take it lying down, and
struggled so hard that few
blows, and those ineffectual,
got home. “I wish yer
father was ’ome!” at last
screeched the mother in des-
peration ; “ ’e’d learn yer
’ow.” This was the cue for
a beery-looking individual
in the crowd attracted by
the noise. Stepping for-
ward with a humble air, he
touched a battered boxer
andjsuggested, “I’ll flog yer
little boy fur yer, fur a
shillin’, missus.” The offer
was not accepted, but there’s
a job waiting—for Premier
Turner requires somebody
to flagellate those Mildura
boys on whom the local
police declined to operate.
Killjoy : The Melbourne book-fiend ha.s a
lovely new canvassing-trick. He calls round with
a small cookery-book which he insists on leaving.
He will call next day for it, or, if you decide to
keep it, will take sixpence instead. That’s how
he puts it. He knows perfectly well that in 19
cases out of 20 he’ll get the sixpence. For this
reason: Cunningly placed on the third or fourth
page amongst “Useful Hints” is the following
printed statement: —
By indulging- your wives in frequent excursions, thn e
or four times a year, you will enlarge their view of things,
increase their sociability, improve their health and tem-
pers, and, more, you will find they have an increasing
love for home.
The woman who would surrender such a priceless
treasure of a book for a paltry sixpence is fit only
for an asylum, and as a woman usually answers
the door, the sale is assured. If a man gets hold
of it first, of course he furnishes the one-in-twenty
case. He either gives it back emphatically to the
canvasser, or pays the sixpence and secretly de-
stroys the accursed thing. Fortunately, I answered
the door.

Parry Okeden, Q. Police-Commissioner,
lately sent much - needed notices to several
police officers. He found them in the habit of
suppressing evidence in the favor of accused
persons, and tendering only evidence against, in

them that it was the duty of the police to get at
the facts, and not merely to obtain a conviction.

“Papa” Pinnock, the ancient Brisbane
P.M., should really have been superannuated
long ago. The other day he ordered out of court
an attorney who protested against a police-
inspector whispering something to the bench,
despite the facts that an accused person has the
right to hear everything that is said to the magis-
trate in open court concerning the accusation
against him, and the magistrate is not supposed
to know anything about the case (save what is
beforehand in his own personal knowledge) except
what is stated publicly and formally.

One effect of famine’s
cruel grip on Japan is the great
fall in the market-value of
young girls. Whereas the
little brown pa or ma could
aforetime rely on getting from
£2O to £4O each for their best-
looking daughters as “ supple-
mentary wives ” or concubines
to the Naice people of Jap.
society, want of food amongst
the poor has forced so many on
the market that a little brown
maiden, taught to be as docile
and affectionate as a dog, is
only worth about 20s. ! Govt,
recognises the traffic down to
12 years of age. After three years pa can repay
the money and get his ewe-lamb back. After six
years, the girl can demand her freedom.
A Charters Towers paper pleads eloquently
for the retention in Cairns of the 37 Japanese
ladies of easy virtue who haunt that skewbald
town. “ They are clean,” says the Towers scribe,
“ they don’t get drunk like the white Messalinas,
and are not guilty of filthy language.” There is a
world of pathos in this cry of an anguished jour-
nalist that his small brown Flossie may not be
taken away from him. That chrysanthmum girl
is neat, and nice to look at, and she is a very ar-
tistic colfee-oolor all over, and what would the
dreary North be without its brown Asiatic Flossie,
anyhow? The ordinary Port-wine Annie and
Beery Jane of the South don’t keep well in that
trying clime, and, what with rum and Kanakas
and breezy fights in the lane beside the public-
house, they are unpleasant to look at. Butthebrown
Flossie is a clean and sober Messalina, and in her
company a man can spend his money comfortably
and be chucked out respectably when it is done,
without a dishevelled head throwing cuss language
at him from the window just as his ear strikes the
bottom step. And as Cairns is mostly brown, in
any case, and mostly Flossie as well, the chrysan-
themum girl is just about suited to the place. Let
her stay—the whole 37 of her—by all means.

The N.S.W. Charities Department (writes
“J.S.” to The Bulletin) has many well-paid
officers and an honorary staff of lady visitors to
whom free railway-passes are issued. And yet it
is unequal to saving the province from the dis-
grace of being indebted to a local benevolent
society for relief supplied to certain families with
whom State children are boarded out! Owing to
the department’s delay in paying the heads of
those families, they were obliged to appeal for aid
to Parramatta Benevolent Society. The incident
seems to point conclusively to a something rotten
in the state of the Charities Department; as also
to a something very inefficacious in the lady-
visitor system. It is not long since Dr. Renwick
was loudly asserting that the N.S.W. system of
boarding-out State children was the best in the
world. If it be so, the best stands in sad need
of reform.

A BALLADE OF BELLBIRDS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The earth has ceased from slumbering ;
Come are the sweet September days ;
Glad anthems now the birds all sing,
Staccato harmonies of praise.
Amid the notes their throats upraise,
One floats out like a jewelled rhyme :
With Springtide’s joyous lilt and swing
The bellbird rings his silver chime.
Tall spears of grass-trees now upspring,
The waratah’s red heart’s ablaze.
And lories with heads downward cling
Hid ’midst the gum-trees’ leafy maze ;
Here flannel-flower her white bloom sways,
Fair vestal of our sun-kissed clime;
While from acacias blossoming
The bellbird rings his silver chime.
Now feathery tree-ferns wave each wing
And form green aisles of shadowed ways ;
Where wanton winds their fragrance fling
The stately lyrebird struts and plays ;
And here the prowling dingo strays
Ere mists uproll or sun doth climb,
And at the dawn’s awakening
The bellbird rings his silver chime.
Envoy.
From all the trees and flowering sprays
Sing halladists of our spring-time;
And clear above their thousand lays,
The bellbird rings his silver chime.
Gosford, N.S.W.
F. W. HULME.
THE EROTIC BARD.
A tall lamp burned above his head,
And o’er his tumbled ringlets shed
A golden grace.
He wore a quaint and flowing dress
Of woven silks. The torturous stress
Of wrinkling thought made deep impress
On his pale face.
His hand lay on the creamy sheet
Where sprawled some lines of “ raptures sweet ”
And “wild desire,”
And on a rug as black as night,
In dreamy, indolent delight,
A fair girl basked, all lily-white,
Before the fire.
How fair she is, disrobed as then,
Not all the minted words of men
Can tell, I vow.
The poet from his labor rose,
And lisped in unaccustomed prose :
“ You know, dear boy, that I compose
From models now.”

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, September 14, 1897.
Mt Dear Myek—
At Randwick, on Saturday, the well-filled
stand and lawn were bright with fussy and frilly
muslins. Frocking is decidedly frivolous this
season ; fluttering little frills meander up and
down skirts, long diaphonous sash ends agitate
themselves in their wearers’ wake, puffings break
nut in unexpected places, parasols are baggy
bundles of chiffon. Machine-pleating is more to
the fore than ever, and appears in a new variety,
“ sun-kilting,” of which there was one shimmer-
ing example on the lawn in quiet-toned grey.
Hats, worn at all angles except a right one, were
as gaudy as a florists’ window. It is the first
principle of style this spring that you mustn’t
have a hat straight. These vivid tints need care-
ful mixing by an experienced modiste. One dark-
brown straw had a miniature variegated poppy
arranged tastefully under the brim, but some
women were topped off with confections obviously
Home-copied from imported models with fatal
results. “Touch” is everything in a best hat.
Several “ early Victorian ” cowls hid pretty faces.
And where were the bonnets? Bonnets and old
ladies are going out together. Nobody dresses
now beyond 35 ; girlish grandmothers of 50 flutter
in muslin and high heels, and drag a curly frizzled
hangover forehead-furrows. Among the gowns
which stood out on Saturday one belonged to a
brilliant purple person, another of rose-silk under
black grenadine glowed like a fire behind
grate-bars. A theatrical girl, in bright green,
looked as grassy as a paddock after the
recent rains. The vice-regal box was colored
chiefly in white-and-blue. The latter hue was
very general a medico’s wife mingled it
airily and successfully with green ; a gilty Melb.
visitor wore one of the few handsome matronly
silk gowns of the meeting ; another of dark green
bore the London hall-mark. A Melb. girl flut-
tered gracefully in a pink-patterned foulard. The
new spotty foulards were universal in blue and
white ; a brown and white was evidently sug-
gested by the new water-color “ African leopards?”
A recent bride looked the part in frilly mauve
French muslin, and a newly-come-out damsel with
a Nellie Stewart type of face was artless in butter-
cup yellow. Two sisters spoiled their ensemble
by tying their heads up in mosquito nets.
It is mortifying that, just as all the pretty and
long-priced muslins have come in with a rush, the
city has been flooded with exactly the same pat-
terns in fabrics damaged by sea-water in the
fires on board two incoming steamers. Bargain-
hunters have eagerly snapped up the damp muslins
at half the price given for the fresh goods, know-
ing that a little cold water and a flat-iron soon set
matters right. And now every woman owning
one of the new muslins will be thought by every
other woman to have made it out of the damaged
stuff, and so all joy in her new gown will be
destroyed.
Miss Manning entertained the visiting delegates
and others at a mammoth at-home on Thursday
evening last at the Victoria Club. The room's
were full of guests and flowers and chatter and
light refreshments and music, and it was a bril-
liantly successful crush. It may have been acci-
dent, but all the songs were of the most senti-
mental kind. It was funny to see stout, solemn,
spectacled, bearded delegates holding up the wall
while impassioned songstresses gasped “ Robert
toi qui j’aime,” and implored, “(live me your
hand that I may press it gently,” or remarked,
“I love thee, ’tis all that I can say.”
In connection with the large Govt, scramble up
the Hawkesbury last Saturday “ in honor of the
Federal delegates,” the most joyful person is pro-
bably the owner of the little pub. at the river
railway-station. As soon as the Namoi landed her
passengers a hungry horde rushed the hotel par-
lor and demanded sustenance in any form, and
until the return train started all hands were busy
serving out tea and bread-and-butter to the
famished excursionists. The expedition was a
dismal failure, owing to the alacrity with which
folk always rush a free banquet, and the lax super-
vision of entry-cards. A long-felt want at all the
Convention reels is a stern, strong man at the
entrance to examine tickets, and ruthlessly forbid
more than six full-grown persons to pass in on one
invitation. The company gathered early at Mil-
son’s Point station, were hustled about from one
train to the other, and arrived at the Hawkesbury
sardine-packed into the carriages; then they
swarmed on to the steamer and forthwith began to
frenziedly hunt for victuals and drink. In the
crush the waiters were unable to get at their ork
everybody was yelling for supplies, and Premier
Reid uplifted his voice in remonstrance and told
the guests not to crowd the tables so. There was
a weak little band playing spasmodically at inter-
vals, and the delegates and their friends were
transhipped to the General Gordon to view the
beauties of the river while the outside crowd on
the Namoi waited for their return. These two
items, and the hungry glare on the guests’ faces,
coin prised all the amusement.
Nothing so brutal as the scramble for food and
drink, said an old politician who was present
has been seen since the historic day of L. l!
Smith and Co.’s “free banquet” to mark the
Duke of Edinburgh’s visit to Melbourne—on which
memorable occasion the crowd rushed the victuals
gnawed whole legs of mutton like famished dogs
and stove in the head of the thousand-gallon cask
of wine which was to have been doled out a glass
at a time to the loyal populace. The Sydney
federal festivities have been made too cheap all
through. The blame of the disgraceful food-
struggle at the Hawkesbury is said to be chiefly
due to the fact that the Ministry, in its desire to
curry favor, allowed invitations to be issued by all
and sundry of its supporters.
A tightly-wedged crowd of Conventioners and
others paddled round to Manly and back on the
Fair-light on Friday night. It had been intended
to rope off distinguished visitors on a reserved
portion of the ferry-boat, but the distinction was
done away with, and the Convention and populace
were all mixed up together. Mrs. Reid, who looks
as if playing hostess agrees with her, came up
smiling in a very radiant hat.
The Admiral’s open-air party last week was very
cosmopolitan, strange faces almost outnumbering-
local ones. Delegates with feminine belongings
meekly trotted them round. It is the Federals
“on their own ” who stay away from functions ;
family parties succumb every time to the fascina-
tions of the freely-scattered pasteboard invites.
Gowning was not sensational. Everybody felt the
party was premature for spring revelations, and
was lying low for the races. Victorian vice-royalty
clad herself quietly in grey, Two or three hats
were in screaming tints ; a hard blotting-paper
pink is a vociferously smart color this season.
Black vvas also chosen by many—it is the correct
wear since the Paris fire made it fashionable to
mourn.
A noticeable feature of the monster gathering
of school children at the concert in the Town Hall
last Wednesday evening was the clear enunciation
of the youthful singers as a general thing.
Croakers who deplore the spread of the “ accent ”
would have had nothing to grumble at, and the
juvenile chorus had some stiff phrases for childish
tongues to lisp. “ The eucalypti’s songsters
flash out their golds and reds ” was rather a jaw-
breaking line, but the children took that vocal
fence, as well as others, bravely, and showed no
trace of “ twang.”
A conscientious conventioner honestly wishing
to work steadily through the Govt.’s little pro-
gramme of business and pleasure, found himself
badly left through trying one day last week to
save time. As he was boarding in a distant
suburb he brought his night-clothes with him in a
bag to Macquarie-street in the morning, intend-
ing to make a quick change towards night. How
the bag was inadvertently locked up by the care-
taker and afterwards rescued, and how its owner
essayed to perform a hasty toilet in the room of a
friend (who was absent) in a swagger caravan-
serai ; how the chamber-maid came in to forage
for washing and took the stranger for a burglar,
and how he got away all right, but was not
allowed, on returning later for his tweeds, to
again enter the hotel on the ground that he was a
“suspicious character,” has been up till now the
Convention’s prize “good story.”
r I he opening of the Art Exhibition was a cur-
tailed ceremony. His Ex., accompanied by
daughter and son-in-law, murmured a few words
of introduction, and the sparse public dispersed to
view the works. The President’s roomy sea-piece
has the place of honor, and is seen to advantage,
which it wasn’t at the artist’s private view.
M'Cubbin’s “wallaby trackers” seem depressed
by the fact that their infant has no chin. Coutts’
anaemic portrait of a musician is remarkably like,
and P. Science’s “ Signor Hazon,” lurking in the
shadows of a deep frame, is also characteristic.
The Queen of Clubs ” is a harmony in coal-
smoke, showing a brown-eyed damsel in black
velvet entourage. J. Mather’s “Golden West”
is a poetic water-color with symbolic touches in
the evanescent red sunset-reflections and dreary
wind-tortured trees. Two artists have tackled
Mason’s Point railway-station, and both contrive
to give that palatial structure a back-yardy ap-
pearance. And R. Coffey sends two counterfeit
presentments of his favorite sitter, and many
square yards of smaller canvasses. A. Hanson’s
downright bush-feeling in his “Station Smithy ”
is balanced by the weirdness of liis bilious mer-
maids relating hair-raisers to each other at the
bottom of the deep blue sea. A. H. Fullwood
reminisces pleasantly of Tasmania in several land-
scapes. A strong black-white is a head by Mrs.
Moore-Jones, and the gem of the water-color room
is a “ Garden ” by a Maoriland artist, Mabel Hill.
The Diamond Jubilee Charity Carnival was
opened on Monday afternoon in the regulation
way with “ God Save ” and all extras. The open-
ing programme was well-arranged, but failed to
lure many inter-provincial visitors. Miss M
Wynne, Miss Daniels, Messrs. Strauss, Burns-
Walker, and Sykes were the musicians, and the
flower-basket presentation was made to Mrs. Fer-
guson by the president’s little daughter. At the
beginning the carnival seemed a misfit in the
town Hall. The bazaar was rather a microscopic
’ten* in that vast acreage of floor-space; but
exhibits have been got into place since Monday.
All the usual adjuncts of the fancy fair are there
with many side-shows. Among the dolls, which
had not all arrived on the first day, a completely-
ngged swaggie and a correctly-costumed court
lady show the neatest taste. The carnival will
keep on till the end of next week.
The hero and heroine of a sensational bolt of
some years back have returned, in company, to
Sydney, where the lady is filling a professional
engagement. They put up at a city hotel of good
class, whereat the guests were on the tip-toe of
expectancy to see the much-talked-of elopers, but,
after a few days’ seclusion, they departed for a
less conspicuous retreat.
New examples of fashionable frocking are found
in Waters and Co.’s “Spring Guide,” which hand-
book of style I see says that the sensation of the
moment, the trimmed skirt, is not imperative. A
woman can still wear her “ godets ” without feel-
ing as if she’s fallen out of the front rank.
Ilounces flutter on soft crushy muslins and wash-
ing-silks, and after thestruggle to be placed high up,
they descended to the hem of the garment, whence
they are again climbing ambitiously to the knee ;
also, they crisp and crinkle on shoulders and
sleeves. You can’t have too much pleating, and
goffering, and frilling, and ruffling about; to reach
the. present fussy ideal a woman must look as
much like a French hen as her money will run to.
Blouses are not possible without several miles of
narrow lace meandering over them. “Is my hat
straight?” won’t be the burning question this
season, as the great object of millinery to-day is
to sit on the head at a rakish angle and be adorned
with a highly-colored assortment of fantastic
raggery.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
Here and there, one finds a female critic from
Lngland (not to mention ‘ johnnies ’) professing
what seems to be genuine surprise at the insin-
cerity of Australian blushes. Melbourne and
oydney girls are declared - to carry more paint and
powde.r to the square inch of countenance than
any other dolled-up. darlings on the inhabitable
globe. In a confidential whisper, the globe-
trottress proceeds to explain that the hair and
complexion commonly met with in sassiety here-
abouts are confined to the demi-monde of dear old
London, where ‘respectable’ beauty could afford
to wash its face in public at any time, as a guaran-
tee of good faith. All the same, the latest reports
upon English rose-culture are a flat contradiction
of this new-chum libel. Mrs. Premier Turner
has come back from the Jubilee prepared
to state on oath that a lot of respect-
able cockney complexion is laid on with
a trowel previous to having its pinky freshness
rubbed in by the second finger of the right hand.
The reckless candor of the British aristocracy’s
make-up quite shocked her, although her husband
is resident member for St. Kilda, and the St.
Kilda cheeks don’t usually get their glow of health
from the sea-breeze, anyway.
“Scenic artist Spong, who knows paint when
he sees it in the street, sends corroboration of
Mrs. T.’s testimony in a letter to his friend,
George Gordon. Hilda Spong’s youthful papa
had been ten years away from London, and it
seemed to him that the British matron’s ideas of
modesty were changed for the worse. As a new
arrival from Australia he was quite shocked at the
complexions he saw around him. After this the
daughters of the sunny south may reckon them-
selves comparatively natural-looking and bona-
fide.
“ Mayor Strong, who comes of pious stock,
attends hops and like frivolities with a sense of
divided duty, for conscience protests against such
pomps and vanities, while as Mayor he feels that
his presence is assisting to make the earth revolve
upon its own axis. That den of iniquity, the
theatre, has been steadily shunned by him all his
life until a few months ago, when he was tempted
by a lady’s invitation to a very fashionable mili-
tary night at the Princess’. Mis Worship sat out
the performance, but seemed to shudder all the
time as though cold water were trickling down his
soul. Rev. brother Strong from ’Oine, the rather
stouter double of Melb.’s Mayor, is an even better
boy. The parson has never been a frivoller until
he came to these antipodean wilds, when so sudden
was his backslide that he actually made his debut
at a ball. Rev. Charles Strong’s clerical garb
was one of the features of the recent civic shivoo.
It is somewhat confusing that the visiting shep-
herd should be labelled with exactly the same
name as the popular Melb. identity who runs the
new religion at the Australian Church in Elinders-
street.
“The passing of Julius Knight has left an
aching void in the affections of susceptible spin-
sters of all ages, many of whom had never seen the
inside of a theatre until wily Williamson and
Musgrove drove the devils out of the Princess’ by
the‘ Sign of the Cross.’ On so high a pedestal
had Marcus and his poetic legs bfeen placed that,
to this day, sympathetic souls mourn his hard fate
in having to go on making stage-love in Adelaide
to one whose nature, so he told his friends, was
‘of the earth earthy.’ Scoffers protest that until
they quarrelled, coming out in the ship, the com-
plainant thought as highly of Mercia’s ‘ nature ’as
he does now of Berenis’s. Mr. Knight and Miss
Elliott-Page, by the way, both :omt the rumor of
their alleged engagement. The latter, indeed,
declares positively that—well, her declaration is
most prosaic and practical.
“ At pretty Miss Marcus Clarke’s first cookery
lecture, the students (all women, of course) com-
plained that blarneying Chairman Neild distracted
their attention from ‘glove-saving scones’ (but-
tered before baking) and similar thrilling novelties
by his irrelevant raptures over the beauty of the
lecturess and her sister.
“The coach-parade, arranged in connection
with the Eindon Harriers meet (so English, you
know) ended badly in two cases. A party of ex-
Bananalanders tooled by a dashing militaire from
the Northern province were the chief sufferers.
The reputation of‘a grand whip’ is easy to live
up to with plenty of showy, well-broken horse-flesh
to pick and choose from. But let a beast come
along who really means it, and down goes the
house of cards. And your smart dames who doat
upon sport and all the rest of it, faint and are
helped into shops at the first kick-up. There are
not many like Lady Hopetoun, who when her
carriage-horses played-up in Collins-street with
her baby and nurse on board, jumped out and ran
to their heads before the footman saw what was
coming. And at Camperdown once she brought
a mutinous four-in-hand to their bearings, all on
her own, and never shed so much as a hair-pin.
Conservative old clans of Victorian ‘ Nicest ’ felt
their hearts burn within them in June last when
reports of the Jubilee grandeur of jumped-up poli-
ticians and their wives daily disfigured the
European cables column of the morning l paper.
As a counterblast, the equally aristocratic doings
of Mrs. Madden, her daughters and other touring
first families were officially chronicled in Melb.
society journals, Also the countesses, marchionesses
and honorable mesdames with whom they lunched,
afternoon-tead and dined. Also the frocks they
wore to state-balls and garden-parties. No item was
omitted which might chasten the parvenu pride of
yesterday mushrooms.
“A certain military junketter, who, since re-
turning from ’Ome, has been offered greetings at
the altar of Momus and, among others, by a re-
joicing Abstinence Society, had a well-earned
reputation while away for singing ‘ Champagne
Charlie ’ with the best of them. He shook him-
self free from the A.S. tormentor when he sailed
out of sight of Port Melb. pier, and neither on
board nor at Ome showed any recollection of his
distinguished connection with the teetotallers till
he returned to this sackcloth city, and was drawn
to its arms with an illuminated address.
‘ Baritone Ernest Pitts is engaged to pretty
Miss Marie Mueller, the singer, who took the lead-
ing rdle m ‘ Lelamine,’at the last two perform-
ances. The fatal day draweth nigh, and the im-
portance of being Ernest is waning fast in spinster
circles.
Sassietv journalism is responsible for another
tragedy. The engagement-notice of a certain
middle-aged bachelor, appearing prematurely in
print, annoyed him greatly. He reproached the
girl of his heart for rushing round with the news
and his chagrin grew so aggressive that the bride-
elect, who is quite a spring chicken, gave him
back his liberty. Also, she gave the papers per-
mission to declare the fixture cancelled. Apropos,
tew engagements are kept seoret now-a-days—l
mean few are kept out of print. When a girl
nooks a man she begins to wind him up on her
loud-clicking reel, instead of letting him run
quietly with the cheek off.
• Banks, a slender soprano, with a thin
voice and a luminous eye, who has showered her
services pretty freely on Melbourne charities, is
about to be benefited. Also, a benefit for Regina
Nagel is talked about.
Lady Brassey’s dear little one begins to grow
wearisome. At Caulfield (Findon Harriers’ meet-
mg) on .Saturday the Hon. de Vere, frocked in
cream, was paraded round, petted, gushed, and
over ’ l° a( ied with caresses and bon-bons,
till the most forbearing acknowledged that the
honorable infant had been far better off —or,
better, far off—sucking her candy on the grassy
slopes of the vice-regal domain.
Charlotte Hemming seemed to impress Julius
Knight at the Austral Salon, the other Monday,
with a clever recitation full of quaint humour and
Irish brogue. _ The adorable Marcus, who dis-
appoints his giddy admirers by a funereal manner,
shed an encouraging smile on Charlotte, and
augured that London audiences will be impressed
by her elocution.
On Saturday (Sep. 11) squads of spectators in
played-out winter clothes assembled at Caulfield
to sympathise with the numerous Harriers who
i a f?S' < 'd far behind in the cross-country race. It
was a touching sight to see each loiterer as he
arrived leaning his tired head on the manly breast
of a friend. Lily-white seems the correct com-
plexion for Harriers’ legs ; perhaps the preliminary
coffee-bath, affected by kilt-wearers, is not recom-
mended as an aid to speed.
“A very successful evangelist, who had predicted
the end of the world and fixed the date of the
resurrection, and was working large crowds of
people into a state of holy frenzy, visited Ballarat,
and piesently had a big percentage of the popula-
tion preparing for its end, and packing up for the
voyage over Jordan. Business became bad, par-
ticularly amongst drapers, it being held by the
women that existing styles were going right out in
favor of diaphanous robes and feathers. At this
juncture a Bridge-street draper hung this legend
on the outer wall: ‘ Bargains ! Bargains !! Bar-
gains !! ! Grand Clearing Sale in view of the
Resurrection! Cerements a specialty.’ It brought
business back. The last trump would not drag
the average woman from a bargain.
What fine scents women have for a ‘ bargain ’
sale! A suburban draper advertised that he
would open his shop at 11 a.m. on Saturday for a
two-days’ sale of shipwrecked dry-goods. At 10.30
about 200 women were surging round the door-
way, and when the gates of Paradise were opened
150 angels all tried to squeeze into a doorway wide
enough for two. Hats were lost and dresses torn
in the mad ■ rush, and the language and scrim-
maging would have shocked a footballer.
“The Mare-Cum-Jenkins divorce-case, heard
lately in Sydney, recalls an incident which
occurred in a certain city park when the
‘Nicest’ first made that place popular. A
flash and handsome bicycle - instructor was
pedalling around with the pretty wife of a local
medico, when the last-named party appeared in
sight. The bike-man took the first of it, and
hopped off his machine with a ‘ Good day, doctor.’
Sawbones paid no heed to the frisky teacher, but
sternly ordered his wife home. Her bike was sold
next day !
“ Pew-rents fell with a thud a while bacic, when
the handsome, high-church incumbent of a
fashionable tabernacle quitted his widowed seclu-
sion for the sake of a rosy, 10-year-old confirma-
tion candidate. For once his flock was unanimous,
and chief-churchwarden and virtuous verger alike
ba-aed in piteous unison at the sight of their cul-
tured shepherd piping pleadingly to a pink-cheeked
giggler who, so far from appreciating the
honor done her, seemed to sigh for the
smiles of her elbowed-off schoolboy-adorers.
Now the-love-lorn cleric, whose fickle flame has
cast off her brief allegiance, hangs his harp on a
willow-tree, so to speak, and has little heart to
welcome back his reconciled sheep as they frisk
home to him from foreign folds.
“ Prof. Marshall Hall is not one of Mark Ham-
bourg’s adorers, and even ventures to criticise his
style. He asserts that Hambourg does not know
the correct method of thumping the keys, and
sadly needs teaching. Hambourg retorts, with
that amiability which distinguishes musicians,
that he rejoices in not playing like Marshall Hall.
“ Melb. Liedertafel is temporarily without a
conductor now that the king is deposed, and the
committee is carefully weighing the merits of
various local musicians before approaching any
one with an offer of the vacant throne. Mean-
while, Gus Siede, son of Julius Siede, founder
and first conductor of this senior and original
Liedertafel (which started under the name of
“ The German ”), is to wield the bitori.
Yours affectionately,
CLEO.

G. H. Reid has now completed three con-
tinuous years as Premier. His rule began
August 1894.
Dr. Bowker, M.L.C. (N.S.W.), entered

quite recently, successfully operated for cataract

“This gentleman comes from Maoriland,

brated for its geysers—useless things which pour
forth great quantities of steam —and mud.” — Mel-

A joke of (Q.) Judge Paul’s. A bully-
ragging solicitor was storming at a witness, and
wound up a torrent of vituperation with “ I never
came across a more unmitigated liar ! ” Paul
(quietly, and with all absence of accent, but with
much eye-twinkle): “ Don’t forget yourself, Mr.
Fogg.”
A Tasmanian gaol-governer, seeking to
inflict severe punishment on a prisoner who had
“given him lip,” sent for two J’sP. to try the
case. After hearing the man’s iniquities set forth
the justices gave him a severe lecture and dis-
missed him. Then arose the disgusted governor
with a savage scowl: “ Why, I could have given
him three days’ solitary, myself ! ”
At Sydney Mayoral luncheon to the Con-
ventionists, the other day, the failure of the
Crown to confer the expected jubilee honor on
Mayor Ives was discussed, and a conjecture
hazarded that if the Federal Convention success-
fully conclude its business in Sydney, that con-
summation will give Government a fresh chance to
jog the Pimperial memory. Looks a little like
holding the sober Isaac on a string.
Mr. A. W. Meeks was president of
Adelaide Chamber of Commerce in ’B7; presi-
dent this year and last year of the Sydney
Chamber; and president last year of the
Conference of Australasian Chambers of Com-
merce—the most important gathering in Aus.
commercial history. He is a Britisher of 40 years’
residence in Aus. ; resident partner in Sydney for
Gibbs, Bright and Co. He points out how in-
valuable to the facilitation of mercantile interests
is the chamber with its 200 merchant members.
He goes back to ’54, when the Sydney Chamber,
in its own words, advocated the erection of alight-
house on Moreton Island “for the better security of
the navigation of that important and growing dis-
trict.” He speaks of the Chamber agitating in ’53
for the establishment of a mint consequent on gold
discovery in ’52 ; refers to its urging in ’OB upon
the Govt, the necessity for telegraphic communica-
tions between coastal stations, and next, in ’G9, mov-
ing for telegraphic communication with Europe and
getting it in’72. He refers to the Chamber in ’6B
discussing the Melb. Chamber s subject—uniform

tariff and Customs union for Australasian pro-
vinces—and deciding “that no legislative action
could be initiated in this direction unless the
colonies were joined in a Federal Union.” He
mentions M. de Lesseps informing the Chamber
in ’(>!) that the Suez Canal would be opened in
Nov. that year, and he also reverts to the
Chamber s anxious deliberations on Labor troubles
in 75. The Costa Rica Packet case, in which the
Chamber took a strong part, is the biggest recent
success. He strongly favors more commercial re-
presentation in Parliament; “while the best of
the British House of Commons consists of com-
mercial men and manufacturers, N.S.W. Assembly
contains only six. Mercantile men hold aloof
from public affairs here because polities have be-
come a mere squabble for fads to such an extent
that Parliament has degenerated into an arena for
carrying on a scramble for place and pay at the
expense of the most vital public interests.” He is
very keen on the introduction of an arbitration
clause in all contracts; he says, “ In case of dispute
at law, how is a jury of barbers and stonemasons
to establish the equity of a case involving expert
knowledge of trade and the sifting and weighing
of a heap of conflicting evidence ? ” “ The Govern-
ment, he said, “ has long recognised the value of
the Chamber s expert knowledge for the enactment
or amending of mere iutile laws.”
Addison, who figures in the Nixon-Addi-

Gov. Brassey has given up his habit of
making political speeches. During his first six
months in Victoria he said he approved of retrench-
ing the defence-force, that Victorian women
would undoubtedly get the • suffrage, that
“General” Booth should be prohibited from es-
tablishing pauper colonies in Australia, that Irish
Home Rule was bad, that there should be an Im-
perial Zollverein, and that protection to local in-
dustries was wise and statesmanlike. All of these
references were more or less unconstitutional, and,
as it was not known how far Brassey would go,
grave consultations were held by some of the
Nicest and Rightest-Thinking Persons—and Bras-
sey was at last induced to coruscate a little less.
John Langdon Bonython, editor and pro-
prietor of the S. A. Advertiser— now in Sydney—
is an eccentric person, though of Cornish descent
(writes a local scribe to The Bulletin) —especially
though of Cornish descent. He once got a screed
from a Sydney pressman, which was really valu-
able, from a newspaper point of view. That is to
say, it gave exclusive information long before
other papers had it. The Advertiser could have
made a “ scoop ” with it, but Bonython funked,
and didn’t put it in. After awhile, the whole
world had the news. Now comes in Bonython’s
eccentricity. Recognising that the stuff was
valuable, he mailed a cheque tq the man who sent
it in.
A. H. Henning, o le of the new Wesbra-
lians, runs the Tasty; man infant pretty close as
the baby of the Federal Convention—in years and
political experience. Henning is a tothersider, an
Adelaide LL.B., 31 years old, who began practice
in Broken Hill eight or nine years ago, but finding
it a cold place when the silver-boom collapsed,
went west early, roughed it on the goldfields, was
sent to the Council by a hundred or so votes a
couple of months ago (on the presumption, it
seems, that a lawyer must be the best legislator),
and now, though entirely new to politics, is sent
to frame a Constitution for N.S.W. and Vic. and
other places on the strength of 22 Parliamentary
votes. The Constitution will have to be pretty
good in itself to stand up against things like that.
Up South, there is a tall, wild-eyed bar-
rister, who may be often seen striding rapidly
along thoroughfares, each stride covering at least
sft. of space, a gaunt whirlwind, generally armed
with a stick or umbrella, and having short
pants, that show a good 4in. of socked shin-
bone between their leg-ends and the tops of his
boots. He once accepted a job to serve a man in
the country with a writ. To save train-fare and
pocket it, along with the mileage allowance, he
walked to the servee, about 120 miles, served the
writ, and walked back to the city. There, he dis-
covered that he had served the writ on the wrong
man—the son, instead of the father ! Vexed, but
undaunted, he got a copy of the writ, and walked
all the way again ! . . . This same joker once
wanted to join the “mounted infantry.” Attend-
ing at the barracks, he overheard the major-
general then in command swearing. “How
shocking ! Do the men swear, too ? " he asked of
the officials with whom he was treating. “Oh
they use strong words sometimes.” “Could it|
ah, be arranged that they will not swear in my
presence ? Ido not like swearing. ” This request
being artfully fenced with, he proceeded—“ Must
all the members of the regiment ride ? ” “Yes, of
course.” “ Well, Ido not ride. Could it, ah,’be
arranged that I could walk ? lam a very quick
walker, and I am sure that I could keep up with
the others. Could that be managed ? I do not
like horses.” Negotiations snapped, carrot-like,
at this request.

‘ ‘ Why is the Dane

Melbourne has its weekly teetotal prevari-
cation. The one-eyed crank sees his facts all out
of perspective, and always gets the relative values
mixed. A recent statement made whisky the chief
cause, of the Phoenix Park murders. Marshall
Lyle immediately announoed that the chief mur-
derer was a teetotaller, that the band had been
chosen so as to exclude boozers, and that the con-
spirator who swore in the gang was a teetotaller.
These facts were announced in the Age, but one
statement was excised. Marshall Lyle actually
saw the men in court when on their trial, and he
testified that their appearance was so eminently
respectable that they might have been members of
the Victorian Alliance itself.

Yic. boss-warrior, Holled Smith, has at
last fallen heavily on Col. Templeton, the well-
known building-society militaire. A long while
ago Smith left Melbourne to inspect a dilapidated
fort somewhere, or confer with somebody about
something, and as he forgot to appoint a deputy
to act in his absence Templeton marched down to
head-quarters with the plain gamp of a peaceful
life in his hand, and as senior officer bounced out
the acting-potentate and took command. When
Holled Smith came back and found a despised
amateur tactician running the show his wrath is
said to have been too awful for words. Then
_ Templeton went to England with the Yic. team
which won the Kolapore Cup, and again the Pre-
mier Permanent Building Society hero scored.
Now he is chucked out after 40 years’ service by a
lordly Smith because he is over the retiring age,
while a lot of older men remain in the force.
A yarn of an Australian hangman : The
dead man had been cut down, and a photographer
was, by permission, present to take a photo,
of the neck-dislocatee. He fixed up his subject
against the wall, balanced the head straight and
retired to a distance. Just as the artist was
squinting through the camera, the defunct’s head
lolled over on to his right shoulder. The hang-
man had to go back and straighten it up again.
Once more the artist had his peep-hole shutter
ready, and—the head rolled over to the left and
caressed Ketch’s knot. Again the hangman had
to adjust, a third time the artist peered, when—
the unruly head fell forward on to the chest.
(Oh ! the neck was properly broken !) This time
the hangman was mad. He wanted the work
over and a drink. He walked back to the remains
of his client, surveyed them for a few seconds,
gave each cheek a vicious slap, jammed the head
firmly back to the wall, and said—“Carn’t yer sit
straight, yer (blanky) ? You always was onrooly,
but I’ll civilise yer ! ”
Writes “ Wurrym” from Perth, W.A. :
“ Jean Ingelow never married; and her poems are her
children.” I quote Bullktin “Red Page,” Aug. 14. So they
were, hut not her only ones. Kveryone’s child was her
child, as well I know. The little home in Kensington
was, five and twenty years ago, a sort of Mecca for bet* ’
and girls, good or bad, and our delight was to sit and
listen to the warm-hearted loving ‘ Auntie ’ —she was
aunt to every youngster that crossed her threshold —to
listen to her of a dark winter afternoon spinning enthral-
ling romances for her silent little audience. She had a
marvellous way with children, and dearly loved an “ out-
law.” I remember once a youngster being carried away
by a violent storm of passionate anger coming to his
senses with a touch of her hand on his head and the
whisper of his name. In her child-poems those who
knew can trace this magnetic power. Curiously enough,
she had a way of brushing adults the wrong way—or may-
hap they did it to her and she reciprocated. Anyhow,
she has gone to a heaven of her own creating where the
population is all children, among whom she walks with an
inexhaustible box of crystallised fruit and tells pathetic
little stories to wide-eyed worshippers in pinnies. Her
brother, who was manager of the Oriental Bank in Sydney
in the 50’s, is buried in Randwiek Cemetery near a burial
lot that was the property of Bishop Barker.
The trademark in
the tea - business of
Quong Tart, the Chinese
tea-merchant and restau-
rateur, is two hearts
interwoven. When
Quong started it con-
sisted of a single heart,
but he soon found, per
medium of a lawyer’s
letter, that in using this
he was infringing the re-
gistered emblem of a
“barbarian” tea - mer-
chant named Love. The
King-street Mandarin
was by no means as
“ downy ” as he is now,
and he was much put
out at this misadven-
ture. So he went off to
consult his benefactor,
Jack Want, and that
worthy, noticing his
woe-begone face, said :
“Hullo, in trouble?
Woman, eh?” “No,”
said Tart; “but I’ve
lost my heart through
Love ! ”

The interviews with elegantly-barbered
English literary men which appear in the maga-
zines would indicate that the novelist of Britain
is a very different article from that made
in Australia. Only one real Australian story-
writer has ever been interviewed, and when the
newspaper-man came away he was too sick at
heart to put his impressions into writing ; so the
interview, such as it was, has never been published.
To a few intimates, however, the journalist has re-
vealed how some of Australia’s best stories are
manufactured. After a long struggle with a
directory, and a longer struggle with the thorough-
fares of one of the poorest suburbs of an Austra-
lian capital, the interviewer struck a grimy door in
an L-shaped lane, off a back street. In front was a
much-decayed verandah, scrawled with indecent
and insulting remarks and caricatures. In front
of the verandah was the gutter, which ran down
the centre of the lane, and in it lay a festering
mass of cabbage-stalks and filth. Knocking at
the door, the writer was found at home, and so
was somebody else—the bailiff. What possessed
the landlord to place the latter “ in possession ”
the journalist wonders to this day; for, with
the exception of a few old boxes and bags
there was nothing for him to take. The front
loom was bare, with the exception of a gin-case,
on which stood a candle stuck m grease, some
paper, and a pen and ink. Facing this sat the
novelist, with his legs extended before him on the
floor, and in that position he was working for dear
life, turning out yarns at record speed, to raise
money enough to show the bailiff out. But, mean-
while, there was no ill-feeling between the two
they had known each other too long—and from a
kerosene-tin containing beer, which stood at the
novelist’s elbow, they alternately quaffed long
draughts out of a sardine-tin.

Dear Bulletin, —Here is a vegetable-

London. The proprietor of a just-then celebrated
London evening paper sat in front of me ; two
chairs from my right sat the boss man of South
Kensington Museum ; away up the table was an
ex _Minister and M.P. When the ladies rose, the
newspaper man lit a cigar and began to spin
elaborate lies—American lies—he had just been
across the Atlantic. The M.P. had travelled too,
mostly in India. He told Indian lies. The cura-
tor told geological, botanical, and general scientific
lies—he’s dead now, poor man. Our host was a
par«on—parsons never tell lies. At last I telt it
incumbent to keep step with the conversation. I
could tell lies, too—Moa lies, Cook Strait sea-
serpent lies, taniwha lies. But I did not need to
damn myself for nothing. I told them about the
vegetable-caterpillar ; how I used to dig it up at
the roots of trees, and give it to the Maoris to eat.
I explained its life history. The newspaper demi-
god snorted his disapprobation. He said, “ Don’t
you think you’d better go back to that country of
yours and dig up some more of them for us to
see?” The M.P. asked, “Aw, did you say they
were—aw —white caterpillars, or green ? ” I ex-
plained ; they laughed. I expostulated ; gave the

Maori name for the grub, and explained its mean-
ing. They remained jeeringly incredulous. Then
I said something disparaging to the British Philis-
tine. That brought out the curator ; he passed
for a great zoological authority. He said, “ I don’t,
as a rule, object to travellers’ tales ; they serve the
purpose of keeping people amused. But when I
see Science dragged into the vortex of Fiction,
then I expostulate. This theory of a vegetating -
caterpillar is extremely unscientific. It can have
no foundation except in the imagination of an
ignorant and barbaric people.” That settled the
matter. There was no more to be said. The
oracle had spoken. We rose and joined the ladies.

The new regulations of N.S.W. Board of
Health, after much friction, are being complied
with in the bush. Every cocky who
sells an occasional pound of butter has
erected covered bails with regulation
floor, and his neighbor, the butcher,
has sunk fifty hardly-earned pounds
in a model slaughter-house; both build-
ings are ready for the casual inspector
at any time, for their spotless purity
is preserved by the cows being milked

A Q. nigger-driver, having lately
used sulphurous language to a refrac-
tory “boy,” the latter went and com-
plained to the local Kanaka-commis-
sioner (a highly moral person) who
gave him the following note to take
back to his boss :
P.I. Office,
, 18th Aug., 1897.
To , per kind favor of
(the complainant Kanaka !)
I would ask you to be kind to the bearer
of this and not use language attributed to you
by him. He is religiously inclined, and seems
very shocked at such language.
, Inspector.
When the “ boss ” got this he knelt
down in a quiet place and prayed for
three-quarters of an hour without in-
termission. Then he saw the humor
of the. incident and sent the precious
epistle along to The Bulletin.

There is magnificent hapuka fish-
ing off Cape Maria Van Diemen
(M.L.), but the Maoris will not show
Europeans the precise spots where this
lordly fish may be captured. It ap-
pears that the pakeha would fry the
fish if he caught it, and the hapuka,
being a fastidious creature, likes to be
boiled or cooked in an oven of stones,
and would for ever desert his present
habitat if once degraded by association
with the white man’s frying-pan.
There is a pathetic old crank in a small
township in Ballarat district who used to be a
good farmer, but who now spends his t-ime taking
wild flights across country, and doing mad sprints
hither and thither. He was driven off his farm
after a long fight by Canadian thistles ; and now
believes that he is being chased by thistles. When
he clutches his hat and starts galloping madly
down the street, the people know that he imagines
great thistles as big as gum-trees are springing up
at his heels, no matter how fast he runs, and
reaching after him, trying to spike him with
prickles like bayonets. One sight of this frantic
old man is all
the encourage-
ment a young
a; riculturist
needs to in-
duce him to
become a

“ Australia’s most successful aboriginal
mission station,” writes “M.D.” to The Bulletin
from the Far West, “ is that controlled by Spanish
monks at New Norcia, Westralia. Over twenty
years ago, the monks settled in what was then a
most inhospitable region, on land given them by
Govt, conditionally upon their improving the con-
dition of the natives. After overcoming tre-
mendous difficulties, they have civilised large
numbers of the aborigines, and, with their assist-
ance, are making fertile a big tract of the wilder-
ness. They have large areas of land in high
cultivation, and are possessed of considerable
flocks and herds ranking among the best bred in
the province. They have a flour-mill and a
tannery, make their own clothes and boots, do
their own blacksmithing and carpentering—in
fact, make all that is possible for their require-
ments. They have splendid gardens and vine-
yards, and from a distance the mission looks like a
village. The brothers take pride in showing visitors
their old-time agricultural' implements—among
them a wooden plough with a wooden mouldboard,
and their first dwelling-house, still religiously cared
for,'and surrounded by buildings that would not
disgrace a modern town ; also, their school would
compare favorably with those of the State. The
married people live in rows of comfortable cot-
tages, and the grown-up males and females who
are single live in separate dwellings -apart. It is
a pleasant scene on a summer’s evening to see the
mission residents sitting under shady trees watch-
ing the young people dance to the music of a band
of wind instruments, played by aborigines, who
would make a small fortune in the streets of the
East, were it possible and desirable for them to go
on tour. Ecclesiastically, the mission is an abbey,
and its head —the venerable Bishop Salvado —is
the lord abbot, and, in imitation of the abbeys of
old, all wayfarers who desire it are entertained.
Those who stay for the night are given a sitting-
room and bedroom, and a bottle of good wine with
meals ; and, if they have horses, these are cared
for, no remuneration whatever being accepted.”

Randolph Bedford, whose poetry has given
pleasure to many readers of this paper, is reported
to be a candidate for Geelong (Vic.). The bard is
a robust, tremendous man with the vigor of a loco-
motive, and The Bulletin, in its mind’s eye, sees
a picture of Bedford, M.L.A., bringing in a Bill
to give everything to everybody, and pounding
the table to flinders in his preliminary oration.
Probably Bedford could bring in such a fragile
thing as a bill without breaking it if he tried very
hard, but a man of his fighting temperament
would feel more at home bringing in an indignant
bull-alligator.

Same text : same preacher : same old sermon. .
There are 231 numbers in the catalogue of paint-
ings at the Art Society’s exhibition ; and the work-
manship of three - fourths of them is admirable.
Probably so much excellent painting has never
been shown at any similar exhibition in Sydney.
Puzzle : Find the Art. Here is much to interest
and admire ; but where is that which exalts,
“spires, ennobles? You have to look long and
earnestly before you get one semi-thrill ot it at
79 Pitt-street.
Brunton Stephens defines poetry as something
that sends little wiggles down a fellows spine.
Painting should surely do as much : some paint-
ing can. Nero and burning Rome, tor example,
in a Melbourne gallery, are always pod for
wiggles for this fellow, the complainer and
caviller. Then why . . . ?
, * * •
Yet painting seems to pay in fair proportion to
the talent expended, if the prices the artists ask
are any criterion of what they get. Look down
the catalogue : hundred-guineas are not rare, and
fifties are quite common. Nearly everybody
jumps into double figures. And nearly everybody
seems industrious. Gordon Coutts, for example,
offers 11 pictures for .£BB7 ; and these, no doubt,
are only part of his year’s work. Without counting,
Albert Hanson seems to have about as many.
And painters of half-a-dozen are plenty. How
many Neros, one wonders, did Haydon paint in a
year ? Suppose, instead of dealing with a dozen
or two undistinguished subjects every twelve-
month, our artists dealt with one, would , . ■
‘ They can’t afford it : they paint to live ; and big
pictures at high prices are unsaleable, while small
ones at moderate prices may find a purchaser.
But, surely, after several years of painting for the
market, they might manage to spare one year to
paint for the Ideal ? ‘ And don’t they .
« * » *
Well, maybe they do ; but as yet, for the most
part, the Ideal escapes them. The picture which
N S.W. National Gallery has purchased from the
current show, for example, shows achievement
just eluding McCubbin’s capacity. Anyway, he
has tried ; and in some measure he has succeeded.,
The picture is called “ On the Wallaby Track,
which is not a very new or true title 5 and the
figures are two trampers and their child camping
in the bush. The woman sits in the foreground
of the picture, with her baby sprawling on her
lap, and she and it are admirably painted, and are
true and artistic as well. The woman s attitude,
full of weariness; her face, full of the monotony
of life ; and the figure of her, the dress of her, the
whole effect of her, do really make her live, bhe
sits there like Barnardine in “Measure for Mea-
gure careless, reckless, and fearless of what s
past, present, or to come ; insensible of mortality,
and desperately mortal.”
Given the woman and the baby and a gum-
tree, one could dispense with the rest of the pic-
ture. It hardly helps as much as it hinders, Ihe
man lighting a fire half-way up the canvas fixes
time and circumstances, and adds reality; but he
is a flat, characterless figure, painted out of per-
spective—too low for his size ; and the romantio
bower of over-arching foliage is out of harmony
with the spirit of the picture Beene is too
“freshly pretty,” instead of being “funereal,
secret, stern.” At seasons and places, of course,
there are many “ freshly pretty ” scenes in Aus-
tralia-through which the wallaby track might
very well travel; and McCubbin might justly
endeavor to secure the force of Heber’s con-
trast between vile man and pleasing prospect.
But that is a subtle effect, and only a great artist
could achieve it. McCubbin would probably have
succeeded better if he had tried for a simpler
result, and embodied a simple idea—making the
scene desolate as well as the persons. And his
picture would then have been, not more character-
istically Australian, but more typically Australian,
since it would have included a greater number of
characteristic instances.
* * * *
But McCubbin attempts an Idea—he makes a
step on the path to Art; and one is grateful for his
pains. Most of the other artists represented are
content to imitate Nature, or to photograph
Nature, or to pose Nature in one-figure subjects—
shirking composition, shirking also creation ; since
an artist does not create unless he brings some-
thing of himself to reinforce Nature, and exalts
her to a loftier plane in the glow of a personal en-
thusiasm. There is Piguenit, for example. Year
in and year out he paints beautiful bits of scenery
and landscape—viewed with an artist’s eye
and nainted with an artist’s touch; but he is
toujours perdrix —al ways landscape, and nearly
always (in essence) the same kind of landscape,
the landscape that interests and charms rather
than the landscape that impresses and astonishes
and awes. Of course, one takes the good the gods
provide, and is thankful: landscape is Piguenit’s
“line,” and in literature no one grumbles because
a novelist does not write history, or a historian
does not compose poems. It would be nice to
have a room full of brilliant pieces like “A
Northern Lagoon” or “Spring-time,” and these
in their degree would be artistic, and their mere
beauty would be soothing and refreshing. But,
in a cant literary phrase, the whole roomful would
be “thin”—while admitting their charm one
would remain unsatisfied, craving tor power.
* * * •
Yet Piguenit’s pictures sell—'fvhich is the mis-
chief of it. There is a promising young artist in
Sydney who started with enthusiasm and ideals,
and painted up to his ideals; and his pictures
graced his own walls, for the beginnings of power
in them were so repellent to the average patron
that year after year they went unsold. And
always his friends said, “ Why don’t you paint
something pretty? why don’t you paint some-
thing pretty ? ” And at last he grew so disgusted
that he dropped his ideals and enthusiasm, m his
small way-like Millais in his big way-and
turned to art that would sell.
* * * *
For the standard of the public in all forms of
art is the music-liall standard, winch makes
Shakespeare spell ruin while Flossie Flingtignts
draws her £lOO a week as a “ variety artist -she
is always an “ artist,” in irony ! And what would
it profit Piguenit if, like the quoted Haydon, he
refused advice to paint drawing-room pictures that
would sell because he “ felt large subjects in the
marrow of his bones ”; if, like Haydon, he
starved himself to complete his grand con-
ceptions, and took his bailiffs for his
models; if, like Haydon, he at last gave
up in despair, overcome by debt, disappointment,
and ingratitude, and groaning “ Stretch me no
longer on this rough world” ended his existence
with a pistol-shot ? Well, this would happen, he
would lose the whole world without gaming his
own soul, for an Artist’s accomplishment falls so
far short of his thought that he is pursued through
life by all the devils of dissatisfaction. Neverthe-
less, Haydon’s work is glorious, and Piguenit s
delightful—and there is something in that.
* * * * .
Pass on. The ever-promising Hanson is another
who wants to concentrate and aspire.. His
“Smithy” and “Under the Sea” are just on
the edge of being admirable ; there is always
something in his work that makes a stranger stop,
and look, and refer to the catalogue ; but he won t
take Emerson’s advice and “hitch his wagon to a
star.” Neither will Gordon Coutts, whose pictures
are full of excellent qualities without being worth
much after all. G.O. has a picture of an old mail,
for example, which has feeling, and character, and
truth. Nobody wants a better old man ; but then,
except the old man’s friends and relatives, nobody
wants a mere old man anyway. Now . . . sup-
pose Gordon Coutts had painted Lear; had brought
Shakespeare’s imagination to reinforce his own
technique ; and had shown us that immortal type
—an old man indeed, but an old man embodying
the tragedy of humanity, with the sufferings of a
race, an epoch, in his single figure . . . what
then? Well, Lear might have been a work of
art; the other old man is merely a good piece of
painting. Of course, you cannot get a model of
Lear, and copy his face line for line, trait for
trait; you have to paint him out of yourself,
create him as you go along. But a man can do it;
why don’t our men try ? George Haughton has
tried some such a theme, in his “ Solitude, and
has failed to get the force out of it, or into it.
Well, he has tried.
* * * *
There is as much more to say regarding 131 of
the 231 pictures; but it would be mere repetition.
Every artist who hasn’t hitched his wagon to a
star can read the foregoing remarks as referring
to him personally, with the necessary changes and
conditions. Only, among those whose wagons
seem worth hitching, it is fair to mention J. A.
Bennett, who can paint portraits so well that
he ought to paint better things better ; T. Dean,
whose moonlit water is beautifully painted, and
whose sky is unconvincing; A. R. Coffey, who is
clever without being artistically effective; and
Gertrude Williams, for something of virtue in
“ Languid Nature Sinks to Rest ” and ‘ Moored.
Also, Spence’s “ Evensong-time ” is attractive ;
George Forsyth and Mary Stoddart, junior, get
good technical results ; there is an uncommonly
good “ Head of a Girl ” by Mabel Hill, some neat
flowers from Margaret Floekton, and some fine
painting in E. E. Cusack’s “ Reading. And
there are many others as notable or nearly the
rooms are full of good technique and empty of
good art. A few black and white numbers are
skilful and attractive; the alleged sculpture is,
as usual, confined to representations of local
nonentities (artistically speaking). One goes
away rather gloomy.
A Woman.
A woman has many pleasures and much to be
thankful for ; but, alas ! she also has many pains,
A woman may not be the slave of mjan but,
where her affections are concerned she is devoted
to him, and often overtaxes herself thereby.
A woman will often, without knowing it,!commit
slow suicide for her children. She will thijnk, toil,
and shorten her life in their behalf. T6o often
they do not appreciate it.
A woman should not allow her colour to fade,
her cheeks to become sallow, her strength to be lost.
She is designed for attractiveness and ha<ppiness.
A woman need not allow any of these things to
happen if she will only obey the laws of health and
use the best means at her command for preserving
it.
A woman needs a friend upon whom she can
rely, and there is no friend which so surely aids
her when she is in need of aid as that great remedy,
Warner’s “ Safe ” Cure.
A woman who has never learned this great
truth, or who has failed to avail herself of it, has
lost a fine opportunity, and is doubtless less strong
and attractive to-day than she deserves to be and
might be.
A woman who follows the best hints that can
be given her, and who takes advantage of the
latest discoveries of science for helping her, is
certain to live longer, appear more attractive,
suffer less, and enjoy more happiness than one
who neglects her opportunities.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Premier Reid hoped N.S.W. Parliament
would be led by a triumvirate in his absence.
When he returned he found Want, Brunker, and
oarruthers would hardly speak to one another.
The Parkes-Robertson coalition (Dec., ’7B,
i° Jan. ’B3) has beaten all other N.S.W. Minis-
•nes to date in length of office. Unless the Pro-
lectiomsts find better leaders, however, this record
t> a - rs^'c H ss chance of being eclipsed by
8.0. Reid and his God-fearing crew.
Vic. Treasury should make a rise by for-
feiting a good many candidates’ deposits at the
lommg general election; in the multitude of
political hustlers some one is likely to be left. The
»wo deposits that Victoria most desires to forfeit
•re those of Duncan Gillies and T. Bent.
At a recent Federal Convention banquet
owo Australian Governors assured the company
that the people, in selecting the Convention dele-
gates, in every case picked the best ten men. The
utterance did not help the appetites of invited
guests who happened to have polled a few thou-
*ands leas than their successful rivals.
Melbourne Australasian remarks, for the
several-millionth time, that if Protection can’t
justify its existence by supplying the worker with
» fair wage, it ought to be abolished. What’s the
matter with the equally logical theory, that if
r reetrade can t justify its existence by supplying
the worker with a fair wage, it should be abolished ’
Protection isn’t the only thing that should be
oailed upon to justify its existence.
Down South, New South Wales is being
constantly held up as an exemplar in the matter of
religious instruction in schools. “ All teachers
irrespective of creed, are required to teach these
Scriptural lessons, and in no case has any refusal
to do so taken place, nor has any complaint ever
been made to the department that the lessons have
been made light of.” The Bulletin will be glad
to hear, m confidence, from N.S.W. public-school
teachers on this question.
Ea Bulletin, —If
it be true, as some
assert, that a community
has just such a statute-
book and just such
rulers as it deserves,
N.S. Wales must be in
parlous condition, see-
ing that in its statute-
book obsolete rubbish is
«o useful law as was the
prodigious quantity of
*ack to the poor ha’-
pennyworth of bread
in Falstaff’s tavern Bill.
And its rulers are—
Reid Gould Want,
Smith, Young, Cook,
Brunker, Garrard, and
Oarruthers—as though
me should say—Puff,
Sneer, Brag, Cheek,
Bluff, Cant, Bunkum,
Conceit, Presumption!
Representative institu-
tions ! Yea, verily. The
people possess the means
of reforming all this.
But, asininely, they re-
fuse to employ them—
going to the polls every
time the dupes of the
oseudo - Liberal su p-
Press and designing sec-
tarian organisation. The
lessons of bitter experi-
ence are lost on them.
Careless, indifferent,
•like without common-
iense or self-respect,
manhood suffrage is to
'hem not a basis where-
upon to erect a live
democracy ; only a door-
mat whereon a corrupt
plutocracy and its poli-
tical buttoners (Puff,
Sneer, Cant, Bunkum
and Co.) may wipe their
boots.—S.
The chilled-steel cheek of the syndicate
made what looks like an audacious attempt on the
public safe of Tasmania the other day. A depu-
tation meekly requested the Minister for Works
flo advance a A for A subsidy to pay the survey-
cost of part of the Great Western Gridiron Co.’s
route to the silver west ! As the Minister for
once happened to be in a wakeful mood the
monkey didn t get the nuts, but, as no Tasmanian
Minister—least of all Pillinger—can be expected
w> stay awake always, and as the formidable
Baker-Palmer syndicate never sleeps, the sooner
the Commonwealth establishes a suzerainty over
Tasmania’s money-box the better for Tasmania’s
taxpayers.
How can any Government, not able, with
the law at its hand, to suppress the Sunday selling
of liquor, hope to suppress liquor all the week by
any imaginable kind of local option? Notwith-
standing patrolling, and officious police, and a
drastic Sunday law, 23 out of every 25 pubs, in
N.S.W. carry on Sunday trading. Will not the
Joe Cook brigade, if successful legislatively,
merely spot the land with sly grog-shops ?
F. : “The poison works. The idea that
N.S.W. and Vic. should first federate, and dictate
terms of admission of other States to the federa-
tion, has become one of the possibilities of the
day. The two provinces are prominent factors of
the _ Australian system, and practically are Aus-
tralian. The accidental omission of Tas. and S. A.
would not matter much—and, for the present,
W.A. and Q. are better out of it. Q. has the
Kanakas, and W.A. has Forrest.”
Manager Lock, of Lucknow (N.S.W.),
solemnly warns the miners that, if they don’t
behave better, they will “ frighten away that
British capital which is the mainstay of the mining
industry.” Every time in the last 30 years that
there has been a labor difficulty in Australia the
tremendous British person has arisen to state
that if the worker didn’t knock under British
capital would leave the country, and the conse-
quences of its departure would be simply dreadful.
Why doesn’t the miserable thing go, instead of
always shaking an impotent fist at nothing in this
fashion ?
Yarrabanker Fleming indulged in some
pretty plain speaking at a late meeting of unem-
ployed. His remarks were very thinly veiled
allusions to the fate of highly-piaced people in
other lands who were negligent of their duties to
the poor. Melb. Herald published them, and
they looked so strong in cold print that much
surprise has been expressed that no official action
has followed. At the meeting itself abjections
were made to the speech, but were silenced by the
chairman’s remark that he couldn’t and wouldn’t
stop the speaker while the Govt, was so indifferent
to the claims and needs of the unemployed.
The appeal to the N.S.W. workers by
Hughes, M.L.A., to beware of Freetraders and
Protectionists alike is, in an indirect sort of way,
another evidence of the difficulty of “ sinking the
fiscal issue.” It is all very good to appeal to the
toiler to keep clear of both fiscal creeds and
parties, but unless a man proposes to prohibit im-
ports altogether he must, if he has any intelligence
at all, have some idea whether it is best to tax
them or not to tax them. While he has such an
idea he can’t sink the fiscal issue ; he may say
he does, but that is all. The fiscal issue is a
buoyant spectre which keeps rising no matter how
much it is sunk, and the Labor-party will have to
realise the fact some day.
SKETCHES AT THE CONVENTION.
Fourteen lawyers are already announced
as candidates at Vic. general election for Mel-
bourne and suburbs alone.
When Labor-member Turley arose, the
other evening, in Q. Assembly and moved his
resolution for the establishment of a minimum wage
it was considered “advisable” to talk the matter
out rather than go to a vote. The time for private
business expired at 6 p.m. and at four minutes to
six Mat Battersby was put up to fill in time. Poor
Battersby in his normal condition—and he was
painfully normal that night—is as nervous as a
hunted hen, and he talked coherently for iust
30sec. I hen he lost the thread of his discourse
lost his subject, his knowledge of the English
language—everything except his footing, and he
tottered even on that. For the remaining 3Amin
he only perspired and gibbered. And at last he
hadn t even another gibber in him, but just then
the long hand of the clock scraped into the middle
ot the A.M, and Speaker Cowley rose with a little
“ a " s dignity from his chair. As he did so
Matthew Battersby found his voice and said two
coherent words. They were “ Thank God > ”
If rumor correctly says that Jack Want is
going to give up the duties (mostly fishing !) of
N.S. W. Attorney-General, Reid will be the only
mere human being left in the Ministry. The
balance is all seraph !
AT THE ELECTRICAL EXHIBITION.
COOK (cooking by electricity) : “ Yes, ma’am, this
cake is cooked by the electric currents.”
INTERESTED VISITOR : “ Them wouldn’t be o’ much
use in our ’ ouse—my man won’t touch any
but seed cake. I s’pose you don’t sell no
electric carraway seeds?”
The Akgus now daily throws mud at its
old idol, Robert Harper. The day after the
general elections of ’94, when Patterson was
routed, it turned on him and rent him. The
next year Murray Smith accepted its dictum that
a 25 per cent, tariff was demanded by public and
Parliament. M. Smith moved accordingly in the
Assembly and was dished. Next morning the
Argus viciously turned on poor Smith. In the
same way it abandoned Freetrade for revenue cus-
toms, and now it is weakening in its adherence to
secular education, and evinces a sneaking intention
of going over to the Holy Joe crowd. The “ un-
bending Tories ” of Victoria are loud in complaint.
Whatever else happens it is hardly pro-
bable that Westralia will come into the Federation
for two or three years. The Red Dust Land is
willing to be taken oyer if the terms are based on
the assumption that its customs revenue will con-
tinue three times as large per head as that of the
other provinces, and to transfer its railways if it is
assumed that they will always earn 12 per cent, on
cost, the price to be fixed accordingly. In other
words, W. A. is willing to sell itself at boom prices.
But the other provinces “have been there,” and
understand that the boom is like the comet —a
hurried, bright thing with a long tail. A few
years hence W.A. will be going much cheaper,
and then the Commonwealth may do a deal.
Richards, the dreary British M.P. now
pervading this country, says he is agreeably sur-
prised at the politeness with which he has been
treated, although you have manhood suffrage
in Australia.” Apparently this strange person
thought that in a country where there was man-
hood suffrage the leading citizens always aimed
road-metal at the passing stranger. But what
Richards really meant to express was his astonish-
ment at finding that he, a 20th-rate member of
British Parliament, to whom no London daily
would give two lines per annum except in virtue
of his office, should be taken seriously by poli-
ticians and clubmen, and be interviewed by the
minor press, and have his ignorance solemnly
published to the world as if he was Somebody.
The Australian reverence for a foreign Ass in-
variably “agreeably surprises ” the ass.
Ben Tillett on the Queen and other things
(Adelaide Chronicle) :
No Democrat has a word to say against her. She is a
very brilliant woman, who has had around her men who
govern, and perhaps the best men she can get. They
have not been worth much, but they were the best she
could get. If there had been a king on the throne we
should in all probability have been governed by the worst
women he could get. That is the difference.
Que i"y : Does Ben Tillett talk like this so as to
get down to what he thinks is the level of the Aus-
tralian intelligence? Slush of the kind is good
enough in Peacock’s dreadful School Paper, but
the average grown man has a distinct idea that,
even if a British king got the very worst woman
he could find, Britain would be run by a Govern-
ment supported by a popular majority just the
same. How is it proposed that that particularly
bad woman would start to govern the empire, any-
Two years ago the Vie.-Bible-in-State-
school-advocates clamored for a plebiscite on the
question. Then the S. A. plebiscite was held, and,
by an overwhelming majority, the pietists were
beaten. Immediately the Vic. people decided that
they weren’t taking any ” more Referendum,
lhey are now making it one of the side-issues of
the general-elections, and voters are being can-
vassed to sign a pledge against opponents of State
aid to religion. The dodge is meeting with rather
f'han usual, the average opportunist
candidate finding it easier to placate the church
party than to give serious attention to the merits
of its case. Some of these candidates are now dis-
covering the mistake of surrender. The R.C.
bishops have issued a manifesto denouncing the
movement as threatening the “Catholic children,
of whom many thousands attend the State schools ”
so that the ‘Catholic Vote” seems lost to the
opportunists. This is considered a grave matter,
because the C.V. is reckoned to be numerically
stronger than the abject followers of Stiggins,
Chadband and co.
The lately-deceased, ex-Gov. Jervois re-
commended, as a military expert, that Wentworth
(speaker Abbott’s constituency), at the junction
*?, *‘ls Murray and Darling, should be the site of
the I ederal capital.
The soul of one
Price of N.S.W. Peace
League) “ burns with in-
dignation against charg-
ing God with making
millions of men engage in
deadly strife, and pour
out blood and fire on de-
fenceless women and
children.” But didn’t
the Bible-God specifically
order the murder, by the
victorious Jews, of the
women and children of
the vanquished '! And,
anyhow, which way is
this peace-at-any-Prioe
driving? Doeshewantto
make out that God can’t
prevent war, or that He
doesn’t want to ? Away
goes Omnipotence, one
way—or Beneficence, the other. The grievous
unhumour of the pietist shows in nothing more
than in his attempts to “ vindicate ” the Almighty !
There are already signs—very, very faint,
is true, but signs none the less—of a change in
the Convention atmosphere. Westralia is a shade
less cocky than it was—with a failing revenue, and
a depleted exchequer, and the evident impossibility
of getting many more loans, the prospeot of
federation is a little more attractive. Victoria,
since the last Convention meeting, has produced
the biggest surplus in Australia, small as it was,
and with a certainty of returning prosperity it
feels more confident. N.S. W. has shown a falling
revenue and another deficit, and the other pro-
vinces are a trifle less inclined to put up with its
pretentions to be the one solvent member of the
group—the financial rock of the Commonwealth.
Ihe change is barely perceptible, yet there is a
difference none the less.
Among the Convention delegates Reid,
M‘Millan and Deakin promise rather better
than they did at last meeting. Deakin has
become a convert to railway federation, and Reid
and M Millan both state that they are now pre-
pared to trust the Federal Parliament to deal
fairly and honestly with the surplus instead of
tying it down to impossible conditions. As no
one can tell in advance what the Federal tariff will
be, how much it will yield, or how much of the
total will be furnished by each province (seeing
that no one can tell what effect an unkn nvn tariff
THE GREAT FIRST CAUSE.
“What’s up, Bill—fall out of the tram?"
“ No”
“Bike?”
“No.”
“ What then? ”
“Missus! ”
will have on the amount of each province’s im-
ports), and as the Federal Parliament is likely to
be as honest as the Convention anyhow, and if it
isn’t honest no mere paper conditions will make it
so, there is much to be said for this view. But
while Reid and M'Millan say they are prepared
to trust the Federal Parliament, they still refuse
to trust it with the railways and the public debts,
so their trust doesn’t amount to very much, after
all.
Esprit de corpse. California now has a
woman-undertaker (Mrs. E. H. Bailey), who
buries women only. This knocks the women-
doctors-for-women-patients notion into next week’s
cocked hat.

Mr. A. A. Atkinson, chief inspector
N.S.W. coal mines, arrived in Sydney a few days
ago, and forthwith enters upon the duties of about
as difficult an office as exists under Government.
The causes of friction between employers and
coal- miners in N.S.W. are not on all-fours with
English causes, and at present the friction in
N.S.W. is in many parts feverish. Mr. Atkinson
comes as the elect of 93 candidates, 11 of whom
were Australians. He will have an important
and practical say in the fate and fortunes of over
12,000 bitter-memoried men.
One of the ‘ ‘ fasting men ” of a few years
back was in the Sydney Divorce Court the other
day at least, his wife was there. There was an
“ Effie ” in the case, but nothing else remarkable
except that the fasting gentleman wrote over
lately from Maoriland to his “dear wife and
children,” asking if they had any objection to his
marrying again; then, after wishing them all
sorts of happiness, he signed himself—“ Still your
fond husband, Charlie.” The wife’s application
for divorce was about the most emphatic reply
possible that she had no objection.
Lord Kintore, ex-Gov. of S.A., lost his eld-
est son by death lately, and Adelaide City Coun-
cil proceeded to condole with him. Whereupon
Councillor Sellar proposed that the relatives of
some ordinary mister who had lately died, after
being a good citizen for many years, should also
rbe condoled with. The horror of the thing smote
the entire body. An Aid. Johnson gasped that it
was “ a, shame to burlesque a death which meant
such deep grief to the Earl of Kintore ’’—although
Sellar hadn’t burlesqued any death at all. When
the L others got their wind, they begged the re-
porters to suppress the incident, and Tucker,
representing dignity and virtue—Charles Tucker,
of the Queen Margaret No. 1 South—arose “ and
administered a dignified rebuke.” He “hoped
that he would never have occasion to so severely
reprimand a councillor again.” Then Adelaide’s
great heart beat again.
The bitter row which some loyal Victorians
and the Age and sundry casual Mayors have
raised over the drinking of the Queen’s health at
that Melbourne Trades Hall banquet seems a very
squalid affair. The row is in two chapters. One
is to the effect that when the health was proposed
there was a long, disloyal hesitation before any-
body rose, and the explanation given is that the
toast was proposed suddenly without the usual
previous invitation to fill up, and the banqueters
only delayed because they had to grab for the
bottle before they could go on with the ceremony.
Considering how the Tory press has gibed for
years past about the alleged beery and whisky-
■'fied habits of the Trades Hall people, it
is altogether too late for it to pretend that
the sons of toil hesitated at anything that
had liquor in it. The other half of the trouble is
over the fact that Ben Tillett called Her Gracious
an “ old lady.” As she has reigned 60 years she
presumably is old, and if the loyal press reckons
that she isn’t a lady it would be a great deal more
decent for it to lie low and say nothing about it.
Any woman who has lived to a good age, and
never done anything especially bad, and kept her-
self clean and tidy, and brought up a large family
respectably, and never allowed her male offspring
to fight with the boy next door while they were
making their mud-pie together in the gutter,
might be called a lady without straining the
British language to any very great extent.

Revised Bulletin Proverbs.
Judge Windeyer is dead. On his heart
will be found engraven the letters, “P.C.”
“ It takes an elaborate education to make
people as stupid as we Victorians are.” —Sydney
J EPHOOTT.
The difference between a correspondent
and a co-respondent: One writes to you, the other
writes to your wife.
“Not even its prevalence in royal families
has sufficed to make madness a fashionable
disease. ” —Maudsle y.
There are nine Queen’s Counsel p ractising
attheN.S.W. Bar and, with one exception (Salo-
mons), all are natives of the province.
Nine portraits of ex-presidents hang in the
Wellington (M.L.) Chamber of Commerce—three
are those of Jews, and four are of Scotchmen.
Graham Berry is practically guaranteed
re-election to the Vic. Speakership if his constitu-
ents send him back to the House. And they are
pretty certain to send the veteran back.
Albury (N.S.W.) Municipal Council now
pays 6s. lid. per day for the services of an able-
bodied man, horse and cart. The tenders ran
from 10s, to 6s. lid., and the Council took the
lowest.
( Melbourne Paunch publishes a portrait of
“Mr. Alfred Brookson, the German warder who
conducted Sir George and Lady Turner over the
Tower of London.” And some have fame thrust
upon them.
From editorial in Mount Magnet (Murchi-
son) paper:—
We detest and abhor the professional jumper, whose
nefarious practices invariably do injury to the district
wherein he cohabits.
A London paper affirms that the second-
hand Parkes statue in Centennial Park cost
N.S.W. Govt. .£lOO, and £l5OO to the original
owner. Also, that the bill of “Eleven Premiers
for seven weeks ” at the Hotel Cecil was £7OOO.
The opponents of lawyer Sam Gillott, in
Melb. City Council, profess to think that lie was
responsible for the recent appearance of his photo,
and paragraph-notice in The Bulletin. No
public man inspires pars, about himself in this
scurrilous newspaper.
Glass tombstones are now being exten
sively manufactured in Birmingham, Eng. Plate-
glass resists wind, rain, heat and cold much better
than even granite, owing to the homogeneity of
the mass. One advantage of glass tombstones:
people will be able to see through the epitaphs.
The prospects of freetrader Max Hirsch
in Mandurang (Vic.) electorate are variously rep-
resented by Age and Argus. Max, according to
the Age, is the voice of one crying hopelessly in
the wilderness, whereas the Argus edition of Max
is a flourishing candidate who gets gigantic votes
of confidence from crowded meetings.
The Reid Govt., dragging desperately for
odd ha’pence, has begun to collect a £1 license fee
from all “whalers ” along the western rivers who
fish from boats. There probably is not a class in all
Australia who see less cash than these poor
beggars, and the only consolation is that the
license fee will take even more chasing than the
land-tax.
In one of Pastor Isitt’s Adelaide speeches
he railed at the parsons who crawled to the boss
brewers, and others interested in the tanglefoot
trade, for the sake of their support. In the same
column of the S. A. Register reporting the
speech appeared an account of an “At home,”
given by boss brewer, E. T. Smith, to the London
Missionary Society !
Among the penalties attaching to guber-
natorial greatness is that of giving names to bikes,
dealers’carts, registry offices, sixpenny restaurants,.

COACHING STALLION LORD BRASSEY.
Lord Bras-iey has taken many first prizes in Sydney
and surrounding districts, is a sure foal-getter, and
possesses an excellent temper.
The squabbles in S. A. Labor ranks brought
about a very mixed state of affairs. Charleston,
M.L.C., who resigned from the party, in his can-
didature for re-election had the support of the
Single Taxers, the National Ass crowd, and a
portion of the Democratic party —a truly lovely
alliance. Hutchison, the direct Labor candidate,
was supported by the main body of the Labor-
party and many bigoted Tories who couldn’t swal-
low Charleston’s single-tax views. Charleston was
elected.
“ Spoke to-day to a ’fore-the-mast survivor
of a recent sensational wreck, and tried hard to
pump him, but failed to extract anything beyond
the mere ‘ yes ’ or ‘ no,’ and a casual remark that
ship disasters were ‘ blanky good things to be out
of.’ I have never met a sailor-man who could
yarn intelligently of the sea, and conclude that
the garrulous salt constantly met with in novels is
either ‘ played out ’ or a sheer freak of the literary
imagination. ” —T.D.
Quote : The name of Mark Twain’s new
book is to be “ The Surviving Innocents
Abroad ”:—
Mrs. Clemens said, “It’s not true for you to call your-
self ‘The Surviving Innocent Abroad,’ because there’s
so-and-so in Cleveland, and that and the other in Phila-
delphia.” “ Oh,” replied Mark Twain, “ I’ll fix that.”
So in the new book there will be an explanatory note
pointing out that although there are still in existence
some eight or ten of the pilgrims who went on the Quaker
City expedition some 20 years ago, the author is the only
surviving one who has remained innocent.
“A well-known and popular clergyman—
Rev. James Kinghorn (Presbyterian), once of
Richmond, N.S.W.) has been presented, at
White Rock, in the Bathurst district, by parish-
ioners, with a writing-desk and stand. On seat-
ing himself in his buggy, prior to starting home,
the rev. gentleman found that a Chinaman whom
he had Christianised had put a present of a pair
of fowls in a bag under his seat.” If, in America,
you told that story, substituting a Christianised
nigger for a Christianised Chinaman, how Uncle
Sam would laugh 1

Medical.
Rheumatism, Lumbago,

can be COMPLETELY CURED by
MR. C. F. PARKER,
145 Victoria Parade, Fitzroy, Melbourne.
Extract from sworn affidavits
declared before a Justice of Peace :
Mrs. Marks, Devonshire Arms Hotel, Fitzroy-
street, near Cyclorama, aged 73 years, after being
a cripple, having all the joints stiffened, and
suffering agony over 11 months, pronounced in-
curable, failing to obtain any relief from others,
was completely cured by me 15 months ago, and
has kept in better health since.
Harry Sanderson, 493 Fitzroy-street, Fitzroy,
was cured by me over 12 months ago, when all his
joints were swollen and in acute pain, in a few
weeks.
Mrs. Nicholle, near corner of Nicholson and
Victoria streets, East Brunswick, ag< d 72 years,
after suffering 10 years with rheumatism in every
joint, failing to obtain relief from other remedies,
and had been pronounced incurable by five doc-
tors, was completely cured by me in two months.
Acknowledgments.
“Dear Sir, —I wish to testify to the cure you
have effected in my case, being a sufferer from
severe attacks of Lumbago and double Sciatica,
which incapacitated me from all work at intervals
during the past three years. I tried doctors,
electric baths, patent medicines, etc., without
deriving any benefit therefrom. In August, 1896,
I was very bad, suffering excruciating agony. I
consulted you, and obtained relief from the first
supply of your antidote, and am thankful to say
after five supplies I was cured. I have kept well,
it being now over six months since 1 saw you last.
—Heleg Exstrom, McCracken’s City Brewery,
South Melbourne, 26th July, 1897.”
Dear Sir, —I wish to thank you most sincerely
for having cured me of Sciatica, having suffered
most acute pain for a long time, but, under your
Remedy, I am glad to say that I have completely
recovered. It is now 17 months since I saw you,
and I have not had the slightest return of the
pain—one week’s treatment having quite cured
me. If reference to me will assist any sufferer to
try your antidote, I shall be glad at any time to
tell them what it has done for me. —Yours grate-
fully, Mrs. T. Hughes, 29 Stirling Street, Kew,
19th August, 1897.”
“Dear Sir, —In grateful testimony to your skill
for having cured me of a very painful attack of
Rheumatism. I suffered great pain, having the
joints swollen. After a short while under your
treatment, I completely recovered. It is now over
three years ago since I was cured, and I have kept
well, being 64 years of age. I consider your anti-
dote the marvel of the age for suffering humanity.
—Yours very truly, Professor W. T. Lamont, Ven-
triloquist and Entretenir, 4 Condell-street, Fitz-
roy, opposite Town Hall, 23rd August, 1897.”
Mrs. Laura Sunderland, 80 Bell-street, Fitz-
roy Rheumatic Fever, six months in bed, 12
months on crutches, joints stiffened and useless.
After six weeks’ use of antidote joints completely
cured. Can do all household duties, and has not
used either crutch or stick now for over 12
months.
Miss Mary Davidson, Crimea, Burnell-st.,
West Brunswick : —Rheumatism 10 years, years
on crutches, and for two years had not walked at
all; all joints contracted, stiffened and perfectly
useless ; life made miserable ; case pronounced
hopeless by leading Melbourne doctors ; tried
everybody and everything without relief. Under
my remedy, contractions come out. Can walk
without aid of crutch or stick; can visit her friends,
and is doing splendidly.
This purely herbal remedy was discovered by
me after years of original research, being perfectly
harmless, and is the true antidote of lactic and
uric acids in the system (the cause of Rheumatism,
Rheumatic Gout, Joint Swellings, Gout, Lumbago,
Sciatica, Neuralgia, etc.). It cured the above
cases, and many hundred others, in this colony,
and will relieve in a short period, and completely
cure the most obstinate case with a fair trial. I
have used it with the most successful results over
13 years in the East and in Victoria. This secret
remedy is not known to anyone else in the colonies.

CURE OF BAD EYES.
To Mrs. J. Kinlock, 54 Elizabeth-st., Sydnej\
Dear Madam,—Words cannot express the thanks and
feelings of gratitude I owe you for the marvellous cure
you have made of my eyes, with the aid of the Dr. De-
Mobray Balsamic Cure. After suffering fifteen years with
Granulations, and for twelve months blind with Ulceration,
your remedy has, after a few months, quite restored my
sight, and the disease has quite disappeared. Your
remedy is simple and wonderful in its effect. I had tried
all the principal doctors in the colony, but without avail.
I am thankful beyond measure, and you have my hearty
permission to make any use you please of this testimonial
and my name in connection with the cure you have
effected with me. —Yours faithfully,

He purchased a reduced-price wheel,
And we fear that he was real
Near the tomb ;
Now the arnica is pressed
On the nose that he caressed
In its bloom.
The crimson satin finish of the Red Bird commends
admiration, and proclaims its high estate as the per-
fect cycle.
CrcLES are coming down in price—that is, the kind
in opposition to Red Birds. Red Bird quality corres-
ponds with the Red Bird prices.
Be sure you’re right; and then don’t bet on it, es-
pecially if it is a match race.
One of the great features of the new Red Bird is
its bottom bracket. It is a triumph of modern skill
in cycle-buildinjr, and is a feature as far ahead of
bottom brackets in other cycles as the pneumatic tyre
is ahead of the solid. The two cups which form the
bearings are turned from the very finest grade of
steel possible to manufacture. They contain ten 516
balls. Each cup is threaded to a steel sleeve or barrel,
which adjusts inside the bottom bracket proper, and
is held in place by two bolts. With the bearing' it is
only necessary to oil the bearings about twice a year,
as they are thoroughly dust-proof and oil-retaining,
the balls running in a continuous oil bath. With
other cycles it is almost impossible to get a perfectly
true chain alignment, whereas the chain and the
bearings, with the aid of this most important im-
provement, can be adjusted to the l/1000th part of an
inch. This is only one of the many new and original
features on Red Bird new models.
Before you select your mount for the coming
season, call on all the cycle-dealers and examine all
their machines. Then pay us a visit, and you will see
the immense superiority of Red Bird over all other
cycles. Red Birds are the perfect cycles with the
crimson satin finish.
Some bicycles can be bought for a song ; but repairs
amount to a Melba song if the selection is not right
at the start. The Red Bird never requires repairs.
Riding a Red Bird with oil-retaining bearings is like
pushing another cycle down-hill.
Bill Martin is going for records on the new Red
Bird. Look out! Something is going to drop soon.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The A. J.O. Derby running makes Aurum look
more than ever n certainty for the Fleiuington blue-
ribbon, and a decidedly “good thing,” as nood things go,
for Melb. Cup Five months ago, when Amberite was
already shaping like the second-best of the youngsters,
he had two cuts at W. R. Wilson’s crack, ‘in the first
instance, Aurum gave the Carbine colt 101 b. and beat
him a length over six furlongs, and the next time they
met Aurum gave 141 b. away and won by three lengths,
the distance being one fur-longer than before.

Maluma and Merman figure among the entries
for the big autumn struggles at Newmarket, and if Aus-
tralian racers are to assert themselves in England the
time for an assertion has nearly arrived. Merman, at
any rate, was quite sufficiently acclimatised to run away
with a minor prize at Lewes a few weeks back. If he goes
for the Ciesarewitch it will be on his merits, we may sup-
pose, and the weight served out to him will be lenient,
considering that he ranked as a “ crack” on his last Aus-
tralian performances. As for Maluma, the mare who
took first-class honors at Fleinington, now getting treated
as a third-rater by the English handicapper : unless she
can capture something of importance before the present
English season closes we must conclude that either the
change pf climate has shattered her constitution or that
“ form ” out here is not nearly up to the English standard.
Meantime we have some more unflattering evi-
dence on the latter point. Imported horse Positano
showed his heels last Saturday to a batch of five Aus-
tralian “cracks”— i.c., the five top-weights in the Melb.
Cup handicap. Nobody needs to make climatic excuses
for the English horses that came to Australia. Of the few
imported within the past 10 or 11 years, three, at least,
have shown fine performances—Lochiel, the infirm
Russley, and Positano. These three facts, together
with the more striking fact that Carbine was
quite English —by imported Musket from the
then new - chum Mersey suggest that thorough-
bred horse stock is not likely to reach its highest
pitch of development in Australia. What price Positano
for the Caulfield and Melb. Cups on his Saturday’s running
at Randwiek? Newhaven’s eas3’ capture of the Spring
Stakes a year ago was considered marvellous. Positano
wins the same event quite as easily, in somewhat faster
tune, and he will (bar penalties) meet Coil and co. on
nearly two-stone better terms in the Cups.
* » * *
As usual, Randwiek proved a facer for backers
on Saturday last. Alaska, an Bto 1 show, won the Hurdle
Race, and then, barring the Derby, which looked and
proved a walk-over for Amberite, nothing backed by the
public won any of the four remaining races. For the
Trial Stakes, Agate, Woodford, and Nor'-East were much
fancied, but Nor’-East nearly fell on his nose opposite the
Leger, and the 10 to 1 show, Zitella, won by a length and
a-half from Agate. Survivor started favorite for Epsom
Handicap at 3 to 1, hut it was not to be, as Robin Hood
(33 to 1) jumped off with the lead and was never headed,
beating the favorite by three lengths. Also, 6to 4 was
called against Coil for the Spring Stakes, but he could not
get any nearer than third. The unthought-of Positano, at
10 to 1, altered his position from last to first after round-
ing the home turn, winning as he liked from True Blue.
And then, just by way of filling the backers’ cup to the
brim, the absolutely friendless King Clovis ran away with
Kensington Handicap.
• * * *
The A.J.C. executive has earned the thanks of
its Leger patrons by now heisting jockeys' names with
numbers, and also registering the “bookies” who ply
their business in that enclosure. But can they not go
one better, and extend similar privileges to the numerous
“ bob ” patrons of the Flat ?
* * * *
“ Chueked-in ” oldsters formed two of the first
three in Epsom. Of late, owners of “good ’uns” have
frequently been beaten by this “postage-stamp” brigade.
* * * - *
The old glory of the Randwiek Derby seems to
have quite departed from it. Four runners this year,
and 7 to 4 laid upon a winner, who is probably not within
211 b. of the St. Albans’ champion.

Bookmakers don’t know everything, even about
their own horses. Spindrift (owned by a Melb. bookie)
after being backed by him unsuccessfully on five occa-
sions, for “ tons of money,” romped in unbacked last week
at tens to one. The bookmaker’s disgust at the resurrec-
tion of the dead is accentuated by the knowledge that the
horse was “a starting price job,” and that he (the bookie)
had laid most of the money.
Considering the present state of the Australian
turf, Joe Thompson must be considered a far-seeing man
in going to England when he did.

Eureka ! Rumored re the mysterious Reka that
he is in the hands of the vet. ; that he has been backed in
the right quarter to win a couple of the big spring races ;
that he has been “spelling” in Illawarn ; that he is
undergoing a big preparation at Sam Cook’s private San-
dringham course ; that he is located within a few miles of
the Sydney G.P.O. This much is certain, Reka has already
proved a dear horse to the public.

Surcingle: “ ‘ The Bookmaker,’ at Melb. Bijou,
is a decent play with a smack of character. Refreshing,
indeed, and how is it nobody has held the mirror up to
Nature in a local fashion? What a mine to the future
dramatist is Joe Thompson Solomon, who said he first
landed at Sandridge as an escapee from shipboard, rolled
ashore by the waves in a barrel ! Then there is leviathan
Slack, whose wife maintained a Primitive Methodist chapel
at Prahran. He couldn’t write, but made hieroglyphs in
his book, which Ward the barber, of Bourke-street, wrote
up for him at night, because pious Mrs. Slack wouldn’t
lay a hand to it. Nathless the winnings came in tidy for
the chapel, which has long bunged, and been sold to
another denomination.”

An effort is being made to introduce water-
jumps and furze hedges on Flemington Steeplechase
course. This will be foolish. Only a small proportion of
Australian leppers are hunters, and, even if they are,
hedges and small jumpable watercourses are as uncommon
here as snakes in Ireland. With English horses it is
different; they are born and bred among brooks and
hedges, and are consequently accustomed to “taking”
them before ever a man crosses their backs. The furze
fences on Ballarat racecourse are invariably ridden
through, and the water-jump at Moonee Valley is far
from being an unqualified success.
Apes of some of Stoddart’s team : —Stoddart,

St. Peter’s College, Adelaide, will shortly
benefit by a huge legacy left it years afro. Head Master
Girdlestone already talks of securing A. U. Maclaren, the
Lancashire batsman (who sighs for a collegiate billet in
Australia), and making athletics an attraction.
* * * *
Adelaide senior cricket starts this year on the
electorate system with seven clubs instead of six as here-
tofore. All the cracks play for different districts.
Another advantage arising from the change is the move-
ment for local grounds, which will greatly benefit S.A.
cricket, as it has that of N.S.W.
* * • •
Some of the Australians who have succumbed
to Hearne’s bowling in England don’t expect him to
trouble them much on our wickets, but this sort of ex-
pectation is very subject to disappointment. Veteran
Blackham of yore predicted that Richardson would have
the cover knocked off him when he came to Australia,
nevertheless swarthy Tom got through his first visit with
a fine average.

Dear Bulletin, —You ask why Peel isn’t com-

Puff notices of the coming English Eleven des-
cribe Hearne as a dangerous bat, whereas the truth is
that he gobs in last man for Middlesex, and generally gets
disposed of for a unit. Richardson will probably take
precedence of Hearne in the Britisher’s order of batting,
and, with Briggs likewise on duty, the team will have a
distinct tail.

The football-match between N.S.W. and Queens-
land, played at Brisbane on Saturday last in aid of the
Q. Rugby Union, proved a close and exciting game. At
half-time the game stood—N.S.W., 11 points; Q., 10
points. But N.S.W. had much the better of the second
half, and the game ended N.S.W. 19 points to Q s 13.

Taking Vic. football season as a whole, the
games have been good, and though the wild, hilarious
times of ’B9-’95 are still afar, there has been publio enthu-
siasm if not excitement. That this is greatly due to the
football league, formed for money-grabbing purposes pure
and simple, is impossible to deny. The division of the
clubs into two departments—weak and strong—though it
has almost killed the weak, has made the strong stronger,
and has invested their matches with a degree of interest
unobtainable under the old order. If the doctrine of
the survival of the fittest, rather than that hitherto
accepted of fair play, be admissible in sport, Vic. Football
League is something to be praised. The Association,
made up of the old cast-out clubs, has gone one better
than the League in the theory of the game, though its
clubs do not possess the talent to demonstrate it in
practice. This is in the number of players. The League
clubs play 20 men a-side, the Association 18, two being
knocked off the number of the followers. This prevents
the crowding on the ball which so frequently spoils Vic.
football, and gives a clean, open game. It is to be hoped
that next year some combination of (he two bodies will
be formed under the League’s system of pooling all gate-
money and dividing it equally among the constituting
clubs.

The feeling shown at the press-table during the
N.S. W.-Maoriland football-match recalls a livery and un-
just remark by editor Winter, of Melb. Herald “ Maori-
land never yet turned out a good pressman, but it sends,
across any amount from blanky bad to middling. And
what have I done to dashed Providence that all the bad
’uns come to me, and Syme gets whatever benefit there is-
in the middlin’ ones?”

Road-racing by cyclists has become very common
in Albert Park, Melb. On Saturday week the park trustees-
caused the gates to be shut in the riders’ faces during the
progress of one of these races. Someone asks “Why
didn’t the park officials inform the club before the start V'
The answer is easy, and can best be put in question form r
“ Do road-racing cyclists really imagine that the highway
is their exclusive property? Why should anyone be en-
titled to a caution against indulging in furious cycle-
riding, when he is not entitled to a caution against the
committal of wilful murder or burglary?”
* * * *
The brothers James (Fred and Bert), late of
Melb. Rowing Club and well-known as members of differ-
ent Vic. iriterprovincial crews, have reached Coolgardie
as the first stage of a Perth to Melb. bicycle trip. The
Jameses are both big, strapping fellows—in fact, they
belong to that class who would be better athletes were
they weaker men. Being each possessed of a good pri-
vate income the Jameses have been in a position to do-
the trip irrespective of the bike-agent, and as there is no-
suspicion of trade about- it, their version may be looked
forward to with interest. A sister of the bikers, a dash-
ing girl of the Junoesque type and a olever whip, is one of
the handsomest of Melb.’s sassiety damsels.

Widgeree : Under amateur laws, a competitor-
must- not ‘ sell, realise, barter, or otherwise turn into cash;
any prize won by him ’ —yet so-called amateur races are
held with bicycles as trophies. Must the winner hang on
for life to the machines he wins, no matter how obsolete-
they may become—or, at any rate, does he? Again,
tyres are often given as trophies. Must the tvre-winner
watch those tyres throughout all time, mend their
punctures, and worry over them, and yet be unable to-
sell his cycle at the finish because it is shod with these
tyres? Amateurism seems to consist chiefly of giving a-
man something he doesn’t want.”
* * » *
“ Signs of trouble re next year’s Austral meet-
ing are still visible. The case stands thus: Vic. League-
was cajoled into giving its patronage to the Melb. Ground,
for the occasion, on condition that the track was im-
proved—the exact nature of such improvements not being
specified. Melb. Bicycle Club, having this patronage,
has gone ahead with the advertising, &c., and has
hinted that in the event of the League withdrawing
patronage it will sue for exes, to date. Legal opinion!
supports it. Now, the Racing Cyclists’ Association:
has considered the matter, and a mass meeting of com-
petitors has been arranged to consider the advisableness:
of declining to enter for the meeting, unless on a different
ground. No doubt the track is dangerous” (writes-
“ Handlebar” to Tiie Bulletin) “not because of the
surface so much as by reason of the want of banking.
In fact, at one corner the track is, so to speak, banked
the wrong way, and to attempt to negotiate this corner
at full speed is absolute madness. In one heat of last
year’s Austral no less than 15 competitors fell at this par-
ticular place.”
* * * *
N.S.W. Wheelmen’s League, in declining to in-
flict any punishment on Bilmartin for having “ gone for”
a hooter, acted in a sensible and sportsmanlike spirit.
Martin is now out with a challenge to any Australian
rider, including Reynolds, to ride a match of three paced
races of one, five; and ten miles, for £lOO aside. Nobody
responds, so plugger Bill sits round in the cool and fills
up with strawberries and cream. When Barden and
Platt-Betts arrive, however; Martin will have to think a
lot harder and run no mucks.

Thirty-six started for the N.S.W. League’s 55-
miles’ road-race, over the Parramatta-Windsor-Penrith
course, but punctured tyres, fee., brought the number
down to a score by the time Windsor was reached. D.
Harvison soon took the lead, finishing eventually with
any amount to spare, in 3h. 30sec.
Curious that the final of the world’s mile at
Glasgow should have been left to a German, an English-
man, and a Frenchman. Placed as named, too. No
beastly exclusiveness about the wheel !

The bike is playing-np with aquatic sports in

use the boats are half-a-dozen oldsters, who are trying to

The N.S.W. Public Schools had a big show at
their sports, on Sydney Cricket Ground, last Saturday.
A. 11. Stewart, hero of the recent Sydney Gr.immar
School sports, went down before N. N. G. Levick in the
100yds. championship, won in 10 9-10 sec.; and was beaten
in the broad jump by VV. J. Smith, who covered 21ft. H.
A. Jones won the quarter-mile championship ; and the
120yds. hurdle championship went to W. Lindsay.

As expected, Nnttall, the English champion,
“ swam ” away from the puffy Ernie Cavill in their
600vds. match. Sydney swimmers in the know laughed
at the idea of the free-living Cavill, who had pretty well
given over the game, coming out on the spur of the
moment to meet such a "tiger” as Nultall. A Sydney
publican and racehorse-owner seems to have put up a
portion of Cavill’s stake, which might just as well have
been made a present to the Englishman.
* * • *
The fact that one of the Cavill family is a pro.
and the other an amateur is another illustration of the
peculiarities of amateurism.

Lou. Casimer, who, a few years ago, was, with
the exception of Tom Malone, considered the speediest
sprinter in Australia, has just been awarded the Royal
Humane Society’s medal for life-saving at Mudgee. He
rescued a child from a burning house and mace a gallant
attempt to preserve two other lives. His case is a
pleasant offset against those of the many peds. who have
“ gone to the dogs."

An old-time foot-runner tells a story parallel to
the “ Billiard-marker’s Yarn.” It occurred in the days
when Frank Hewitt was still very fleet of foot. A big,
black-bearded “country-man” (one of the best athletes
who ever left Ireland) struck Hewitt and his crowd, and
showed the possession of considerable cash. Flynn, of
Gippsland, as he was known, was quickly led on to talk of
his running-powers, and a match was fixed up between
him and the Englishman for 50yds., at £'so a side. Flynn
put up his own £5O, while Hewitt’s was, as the mining-
promoters say, “ over-subscribed.” The day came, and
the race. Hewitt stood on the mark, full of easy con-
fidence. When the pistol fired Flynn bolted, and simply
lost his opponent. But he was over-honest; had he not
shown his hand thus, his beard would have let him into
several “ Botanys.”

The other day four boys were prosecuted for
hunting a kangaroo at Frankston, Vic. The boys were
small, and they chased the kangaroo with an ungainly
and amiable pup. The kangaroo took refuge in a man’s
garden, and the man slew if, with a rail. The boys were
fined. A week or two earlier Melb. papers gave profuse
pictures and much thrilling letterpress to the pourtrayal
of a kangaroo-hunt in which members of the vice-regal
party and suite took a prominent part. This party killed
one kang. and captured a joey. Police prosecutions will
follow, of course, we don’t think. There is not one law for
the high and one for the low —there is only one for the
low.

Billiardist John Roberts uses billiard-balls as
barometers, and can forecast the weather thereby for
hours ahead. When a storm approaches, the click of the
balls loses its sharpness, and the rebound lessens in elas-
ticity. As the weather improves, the click and rebound
both rise toward the normal.

A notice in the advertising columns of this
issue invites the public not to “ bet in the dark” but buy
the “Turf Pilot” and be enlightened and illuminated.
The idea of being illuminated by a pilot instead of being
kept off the rocks is rather a confusion of metaphor, but
possibly the pilot lights up the scene by spontaneous
combustion arising through a long career of hard gin-
drinking. Anyhow, there is a lot of valuable information
in the “ Pilot,” and if anything can shed the light of
reason on so irresponsible an animal as the racehorse this
volume will do it.


The £250 compensation awarded the peti-
tioner in a recent Sydney divorce-case was well-

the balance as between attorney and client of his
side’s expenses of a four-days’ trial 1

statement that the increase of over 13,000 showed
that “ our manufacturing industries were in a

Cormnandant and party actually fled a consider-
able distance, but the dour old Scotchman insisted
on a return, and a combat eventuated, which re-
sulted in sundry dead niggers and the dispersal of
the offending elan. But rifles ! This is some-
thing new for the Papuan !

A stranger arose at a recent meeting of
Melb. Freetrade Democratic Association and
gravely requested to be allowed to relieve himself
of some opinions. Then he went on in a weighty
manner to inform the meeting that at one time he
was a Protectionist; he once believed, he said,
that Freetrade was only a beautiful theory, utterly
impracticable. He enlarged at much length on
his former opinions, the inference being that in
those days he was a mental incapable, an ignora-
mus, and several kinds of an ass. “ Gentlemen,”
he said, in conclusion, “I believed in those times
that Freetrade was arrant folly, and that the only
hope for the country lay in a Protective policy,
and it gives me great pleasure to be able to declare
now before you all— that I believe so still.” Before
the meeting had recovered sufficiently to kick him
the solemn orator had passed out.

An interesting railway case was lately heard
in Melb. A woman had her fingers jammed by a
closing door, and negligence was alleged against
the railway department on account of the fact that
the edge of the seat on which she sat was flush
with the door. The Department fought hard for
a non-suit, and put several big guns into the box
to give evidence on the point. Plaintiff’s case
was well fought by Andrews, a recently-admitted
barrister, who managed to win on the non-suit,
but to the Department’s great relief the jury
found in its favor on the facts. A defeat would
have meant a reconstruction of very many Vic.,
and a still greater number of N.S.W. and Tas.,
carriages. And the point’s not really settled yet.

“ How to double our party,” was the in-

suggested, and yet it is the only plan.
Dear Bulletin, —Prayer for rain does
sometimes answer, despite the scoffing of The
Bulletin and other unbelievers. We had a
drought recently in Maoriland —not much of a
drought, perhaps, but a very good one for us.
One Methodist sect in a Hawkes Bay township
proposed having a school picnic, and a rival
Dipper sect prayed for rain—presumably to spoil
the show. But the weather kept fine, and as the
next best thing the Dippers arranged a picnic of
their own for the same day, to keep their people
away from the opposition orgy. It was held in a
secluded gully, and that afternoon, just as the
shivoo was in full blast, it rained like H—any-
thing. The moist saints started for home with
torrents rushing off their monkey beards, and as
they hoisted the heavy saintesses over streams of
rain-water, and feasted their eyes on Sister Mary
Hann’s muddy underskirts and skinny ankles,
they realised the efficacy of prayer and were not
at all comforted.—R.T
Ed. Bulletin, —Now this cruel crawl is
over, and the might of the record-reign extolled
to a finish, it is worth while glancing at the record
of a queen who occupied the throne for the
shortest term among our female monarchs. Of
kings and queens, the truth is not spoken of the
quick but of the dead. Of Mary the Second, it is
recorded that she deprived herself, by taking
money from her household funds, to buy bread
for the poor. In this, there is an approach to the
widow s mite in contradistinction to the Windsor
widow’s might. There is not much gaud and
glitter about Mary’s short record, but it shone
bright in the memory of her poorer subjects. Says
Macaulay—“ Mary’s blameless life, her large
charities, and her winning manners had con-
quered the hearts of her people.” She hadn’t 60
years and unlimited opportunities to do it in.

been so much her own, none had been so near her
heart, as that of converting the palace at Green-
wich into a retreat for seamen.” Where’s Victoria’s

An original petition. One ward at the
big Salpetriere hospital, Paris, is old and dilapi-
dated, and the bug which walks by night lately
rendered sleep impossible to its occupants. Re-
monstrances and requests for relief being unavail-
ing, a large bug-hunt was organised one night by
all the patients who could walk or crawl, and a
bowlful of the smellsome insects was sent with
their compliments to the head of the Board of
Health, with a note to the effect that he would
receive a similar present every morning till things
were righted. That one bowlful did the trick.

Has much pleasure in presenting to the Public the following overwhelming evidence of the great virtues
his REMEDIES contain.
Testimonials
A Magistrate Cured of Nervousness and
Biliousness.
160 Elizabeth-st., Melb.
Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure to inform you that a
course of your Alfaline Pills completely cured me of a
severe case of biliousness and nervousness. I may also
mention that several of my friends to whom I have re-
commended your remedies have derived great benefit
from them ; therefore, I consider you are deserving of
success, which I do most heartily wish you.—Yours grate-
fully, A. HARRIS, J.P.
Nervousness Cured.
The well-known and popular representative of the
Sydney Bulletin, a gentleman whose testimony carries
special weight, writes thus: To Herr Rassmussbn.— Dear
Sir, —I think it my duty to inform you that a course of
your Alfaline Vitality Pills acted very beneficially on my
nervous system, and, in consequence, I have recom-
mended them to many friends, who have all been cured
by their use.—-Yours, R. A. LUCK.HAM.
A Much-valued Testimonial from one of
Australia’s Most-Prominent Explorers.
Grand Hotel, Spring-st., Melbourne,
March 7th, 1895.
To Herr R*ssmussen,
Proprietor of the Alfaline Remedies.
Dear Sir, —It gives me great pleasure to inform you that
I have derived great benefit from your celebrated Alfaline
Remedies during my exploring expeditions throughout
Australia, and I consider them invaluable to all travellers
in the bush.—Yours very truly, B. HJTTON
(Formerly a Councillor, Brighton, England).
Witness: A. F. leker, Manager, Grand Hotel, Spring-
street, Melbourne.
Mr. Button writes later:-" The Pills I had from you
were of great benefit to me and others. In one case,
when three hunters and trappers were travelling about
the ranges near my place on the Bose River, one was taken
very ill ; his mates intended taking him in a waggon to
Wangaratta (about 60 miles) next morning to see a doctor.
I gave him a few of your Pills. I am pleased to inform
you that, having to pass their camp next day, I found
him up and pegging-out his skins and looking well. This
speaks volumes for your valuable Remedies.”
A Cyclist Cured of Piles.
It affords me very great pleasure to bear testimony to
the efficacy of your Alfaline Pile Powders, which cured
me after almost every known medicine had failed. My
case was a most serious one ; it had been caused through
bicycle-riding in wet weather, and the Piles were of the
internal kind and caused me the most excrusiating pain.
—Yours truly,
WILLIAM HANSON,
Cycle Agent and Tobacconist,
Narrandera, N.S.W.

Dear Sir,—lt gives me great pleasure to inform you that
your Alfaline Liver and Kidney Pills completely cured me
of a severe affection of the liver and kidneys. I found my
illness to interfere greatly with me in my profession, as a
teacher of singing, but I am very pleased to say that all
my pains are gone, and all my former vigor and strength
have returned, and I feel like a new man. I may say that
before taking your Pills I had a great lump on the liver
which could be felt from the outside, and which com-
pletely disappeared as soon as I took your Pills. You ar u
quite at liberty to publish this testimonial.

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussbn. August, i 894
Dear Sir,— ln the year 1871 I contracted rheumatism
and stiffness in the joints, and have tried all advertised
medicines. When I came to Sydney I had a great diffi-
culty in walking. Passing your window, I saw a testi-
monial from Mr. E. W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same
complaint as I had, which led me to try your Hemedies.
On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first of your
Pills, and I am now, with the blessing of God, as well in
health as I was 23 years ago. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.—l
remain, Dear Sir, yours very gratefully,

A Valuable Vessel Nearly Lost.
In the olden days when steam power was not so
universally applied to the propulsion of ocean
carriers as it is now, long voyages were seldom
undertaken in sailing ships excepting when neces-
sitated by matters of urgency and where no alter
native existed. Mr. Ernest Buckhold, residing at
226 George-street, Sydney, late chief steward of
s.s. “ Menmuir,” of the E. and A.S.S. Company,
is now 51 years of age and has been seafaring fot
32 years. The story of his miraculous escape from
death will, no doubt, prove acceptable to readers.
To a reporter he made the following statement
“ I arrived in Sydney in May, 1890, from Japan,
suffering severely from pains in the right leg.
The trouble increased daily to an acute stage. I
ascribe the malady to exposure and wet feet.
The pains were first in the hip, and occasionally
shot to the calf and the foot. I had no peace or
rest night or day. I could not sit down to a meal,
but had to lean heavily against the table. Tin-
pain took away all desire for food, and I could not
sleep. I had to leave the ship, and take to becfat
Ashfield. I got worse, and was bed-ridden, and
in great agony for three months. My hip grew
out, and the joint bone in the back protruded. I
endeavored to get about the house with the assist-
ance of two sticks. But it was a great struggle to
move, and caused excruciating pam. I could not
bear to put the foot to the floor. Two months
afterwards, in September, I had to take to bed
again, and for 70 nights morphia was injected. I
remained in bed till the 31st December last. In
January of this year I saw Captain Green, the
Superintendent of the E. and A.S.S. Company,
and he granted me a passage to Japan. This was
done with the hope that the change would effect a
cure. Five days after leaving Sydney the full
fury of the malady returned. In fact, it was
worse than ever. I was unable to go to the table
for food, and would rather go without a meal than
walk a short distance. The perspiration would-
pour out of me with the pain, which doubled me
up. The slightest movement meant- indescribable
torture. Yet there was no cessation from suffer-
ing while I kept quiet. When I arrived in Japan
I thought to take a position at Kobe, but I found
that the incessant pain incapacitated me for any
work. I was Compelled to return by the Aus-
tralian, and arrived in Sydney on the 13th May
last, a physical wreck, and a bag of bones, and
with undiminished pain. Two days later I met
Captain H. Craig, of the s.s. Guthrie, and he
advised me to try Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale
People. At the same time he handed me £l, and
told me to get the pills at once, which I did. This
was a critical moment and I despaired of recovery.
I was like a vessel suddenly taken aback ; every-
thing seemed against me. 1 followed the directions
for taking Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, and, after
using three boxes, I felt much improved. I con-
tinued with the fourth, with happy results. I had
four pills left from the 6th box, when I had
become perfectly strong, healthy, and robust. I
can now walk any distance without fatigue, and
suffer no pain whatever. My appetite is keen.
The recovery was gradual at first, and then rapid
towards absolute cure. I began the pills on the
15th May, and put the unswallowed four aside on
the 14th Jline. I have taken none since, for my
health has been thoroughly re-established. I
arranged with Captain Legg, of the s.s. Thornley,
to go as chief steward as far as Adelaide, to ascer-
tain how I would get along on a sea-voyage.
Well, the work was hard, and the weather bad,
and iny feet and clothing were often wet, but I
fared first-class, and suffered no ill-effects. I
returned to Sydney on the sth July by the
A.U.S.N. Company’s steamer Waroonga in per-
fect health and strength. I now feel fit for any
work.
“Yes, I passed through twelve months of un-
speakable suffering, which, I am sure, would have
been averted had I known of the extraordinary
efficacy of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale
People. However, I trust my experience may
bring hope to the hearts of others suffering from
sciatica.”
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People posi-
tively cure rheumatism, sciatica, lumbago, and
neuralgia, and influenza’s after effects, and are a
specific for all diseases of women, such as anaemia,
poor and watery blood, female irregularities,
nervous headache and hysteria, and are sold by
chemists and storekeepers generally, or the Dr.
Williams’ Medicine Company, Sydney, will for-
ward, on receipt of stamps or post order one box
for 2s. 9d. or half-dozen for 15s. 3d.

An interesting wail :
Editor Bulletin,— l presume you take it that The Bul-
letin is a fit and proper paper for any young- man to read ?
Cursed be the day I first read it! I was happy till then.
X believed in God, in priests and parsons, now I believe in
—nothing but Revolution. According to The Bulletin,
there was but one decent mah in the world —George
Higinbotham! When I was a “right-thinking” young
man I got on well in the world ; but now, alas! my Bul-
letin ideas get me the cold shoulder of decent, respect-
able people. I get into numerous rows with “ scabs ” and
other crawlers, which is rather awkward considering
how numerous they are. The Bulletin ideas are all right
if ohe was in an independent position. I have been
struggling now for 17 years and have been reading The
B. regularly, and I can’t get lower down in the world
than I am. So I think I will “ turn it up ” and take to
the Protestant Standard or the Catholic Times. A cove
told me once I would be “ always poor so long as I read
The Bulletin.” He Was a well-to-do Scotchman. Some
poor, deluded creatures call The Bulletin the “ Poor-
man’s Bible 1 ” This game of writing is not in my line,
but I thought I’d let you know I am beginning to think
The B. ain’t God no more than j. Bull is Creator of the
earth.— Parasite.
‘ ‘ Broken Hill ” on an interesting pastoral
question :
The long - continued deterioration of far-inland Aus-
tralian pastoral country, especially the saltbush lands of
H.S.W. and S.A., has revived the movement in favor of
small paddocks (small paddocks out yonder meaning any-
thing up to 5000 aores). Peter Waite, principal holder of
Momba, N.S.W.’s broadest squattage, is experimenting at
Ophara, and, to some extent, also on Momba itself; and,
mainly because Peter Waite is reckoned about the best
dry-country man in Australia, small paddocks threaten to
become a craze. Counting up their virtues on the fingers,
you get well on to the second hand, too. The great con-
sideration is that vermin are under control in small pad-
docks—and, it might be added, in no other way. Also,
country can then be most effectively ahd economically
spelled ; and, with small paddocks, the lambing ought to
be better. But paddocks, big or little, are not much
good without water; and little tanks or dams are
utterly unreliable in those droughty parts, while it
is very doubtful whether it will pay to put-
down big works in small paddocks whoseo carry
ing capacity is strictly limited. Besides, cat hments
for even small tahks are hot to he picked up on every
three or five Or 20,000 acre block ; and when you’ve got
your catchment, it doesn’t follow that you’ve got holding
ground. One after another, appraisers and assessors with
coastal and mountain experience, who have been sent out-
back under various Lands Acts, have started with a cock-
sure advocacy of small paddocks, in a month or two have
been doubtful about it, ahd before they have completed
their inspections have concluded that, after all and gener-
ally speaking, it might be just as well to let the thing
slide.

A Bulletin correspondent:—
Ever drive a traction engine in the backblocks 7 O, it’s
gay. Taking her down from Sydney to Cootamundra we
met a man on horseback ; and, as usual, the horse shied.
The rider, as much astonished as his beast, tied up to a
fence, and came to inspect us. As he did so
horse dropped with a thud and remained motionless.
“ Your moke is dead,” says my mate. He looked round,
then stared at the engine again, and we left him staring.
Further on we wanted to take a short cut through a
station, but were forbidden by the boundary-rider, till
we threatened to get a map and open up every road on
the run, when he yielded so far as to show us a green line
of timber, which he told us to “ foller right along.” We
did, and I wouldn’t like to say how many fences we went
through—so easily that you wouldn’t know you touched
anything. We camped that night near a dam, and the
squatter rode up to warn us against taking any water.
We kept him on the other side of the engine for fear he’d
see the hose pulsing up and down like a snake in the
grass. By the time he’d finished the tank was full, so we
cheerfully agreed not to take a drop out of his dam tank.
One morning, in passing through Coota, with three loaded
waggons, we turned a corner rather sharply and brought
away some fencing and part of a house. We didn’t know
anything about it till we came back in the evening, when
“ our attention was drawn to the matter ” as politely as
the Irish blood of a Mrs. O’Something would allow. We
made money when the drought came, and the language
of the weatherbound bullockies, as we passed by, was
crimson. We were taking one load across the river at
Booligal, but the bridge was ricketty, and the authorities
refused to allow the engine to cross, so we had to camp.
The bullockies were cheerful, for although there was a
good crossing, the water was deep and would put out our
fire if we tried to cross. About midnight we got up full
steam, detached the waggons, fastened one end of a rope
to a tree on the other side, and fixed the other on to our
winding-drum. Turning on steam, we began to wind
ourselves over the crossing. About half-way over the
fires were out, but there was enough steam in the steam-
chest to drag us half-way up the other bank—where we
relit our furnace and drew up to the top. Then, passing
a line over the bridge, we pulled the waggons across, and
waited for day to dawn on the profane bullockies. Some
few weeks afterwards a pub. was burnt down, just after
we had passed it, and the owners got damages against us.
To pay, we had to sell the engine.— Eurotah.

MUSHROOMS AND EGGS.
Take several large mushrooms, and with a spo*n
scrape from the inside all the pink fur; chop it
small. Take the stalks and white outside and boil
in a pint of milk for one hour, then strain. Put
the fur of th* mushroom into the milk, and cook
gently for ten minutes ; thicken with flour into a
sauce, and place four hard-boiled eggs, cut in
halves, on a dish, edge upwards ; pour the sauce
over.
THE WARM CORNER
is the welcome corner in these draughty days of
Winter, when the fire glows warm and cheerful.
But—this fire,
and its warmth,
draw the cold air
into the room
whenever a door
is opened, and
underneath the
door all the time
if the door does
not fit tightly.
A loose mat laid
against the entry
is pushed away
every time any-
one comes in. It
is better to tack
a little strip of
felt along the
bottom of the
door itself. A
scre e n, again,
does wonders in keeping draughts out; and there
is no more cheerful sight for an incomer than a
comfortable armchair and a screen.
THAT ARMCHAIR,
however, should not slope too much in the back, or
it becomes uncomfortable to read or work in.
A WINTER TROUBLE
that affects many of us is cold, chilly hands and
feet. They come from defective circulation and
poverty of the
blood. Poor
blood is what the
doctors call anae-
mia, always a pre-
valent trouble
where women are
concerned. It
gives pallid
cheeks, flat figure,
languidness, and
a way of being
easily tired. Very
often it is the
first step towards
“ decline,” or, as
people call it, con-
sumption. Better
stop it in time.
It is good to be
rosy and well if
you can. Here
is a true story : Miss Richardson, daughter of
the manager of a large brickworks at King’s Dyke,
Whittlesey, in Cambridgeshire, is a picture of
health. Yet a little while ago she was in a con-
sumption. Doctors attended her, but the girl
made no progress, and became so weak that all
quite expected her to die as consumptive people
do die. By the merest accident the father found
out what can be done by Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
for Pale People. He read it, and said to his wife,
“ Here’s somebody advertising, and if only half
what it says is true, there’s hope for Jane
yet.” The same night he sent for a box of
Pills, and before half the box was gene saw a
marked change. Miss Richardson is, in her
father’s words, “ A woman again, and quite well.
Her disease was a decline —consumption; but
there are no signs of that now. She was so weak
that she could do nothing ; it appeared as if she
hadn’t the strength to walk. But Dr. Williams
Pills entirely cured her.”
This is an example for all women who feel lan-
guid, have a pain in the chest or the back, or fell
the need of a tonic.
DO NOT MAKE A MISTAKE.
Have the genuine Pills which cured Miss
Richardson, as I have just told you. They are
only to be had in a wooden
tube or box in a closed pink
wrapper, bearing the full
name, “Dr. Williams’Pink
Pills for Pale People.” In
case of any doubt it is bet-
ter to send to the makers
(the address is Dr. Williams’
Medicine Company,
Queen’s Chambers, Queen’s
Place, Sydney) than to ac-
cept any substitute, for
these Pills are not like ordi-
nary medicine.
A PRETTY TIPPET
AND MUFF.
This is, as you see, a very
stylish addition to a dress
or cloth jacket —a tippet
fashioned in velvet, and
trimmed with ostrich-feather and chiffon kilting,
and a fascinating muff en suite. When the brighter
weather allows of lighter and daintier toilettes
this will be found useful.
Woman at 45.
What Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills will do for
Women at the change of life is shown in a case
reported in the Dewsbury (Eng.) Chronicle. It
is that of Mrs. Benjamin Smith, who lives at
Hanover-street, Dewsbury. The change of life
had left her weak and miserable ; with constant
pains, dizziness, and shortness of breath on the
slightest exertion, together with chronic rheuma-
tism in the head and eyes. The pain in her head
was too acute for words; she got no sleep either
by day or by night, and her agony was at times
so great that it took two people to hold her in bed.
A skilful doctor was called in, but did no good.
“ My cheeks would swell up as big as saucers,
says Mrs. Smith ; “my eyes were as red as fire,
and there was no getting rid of the pains in the
head. I also suffered from a sluggish liver and a
weak heart, and at times my eyesight was so bad
that objects before me seemed but dim shadows,
and there were none of my friends who looked for
my restoration to health.”
“I saw an account in a newspaper of a cure
similar to mine through the use of Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills, and my husband urged me to try
them. Before two boxes were used the pains had
disappeared as if by magic, and the continued use
of the Pills for a little more than a month has left
me enjoying as good health as ever I had in my
life. I consider Dr. Williams Pink Pills a bless-
ing and as I know there are thousands of women
who suffer in silence from troubles having the
same origin as mine, I am grateful enough for
what they have done for me to tell my story in
the hope that some suffering sister may be
eimilarly helped, and you have full permission to
publish what I have told you, which statements
can be verified by any of my neighbors. .tv ll3
wonderful remedy is offered to the public with a
full confidence that there_ is no disease arising
from a watery or impoverished condition of the

not cure if the directions are faithfully followed
and the treatment persisted in.
The Terrible Influenza.
ITS RAVAGES ARE APPALLING—ONLY
PROMPT MEASURES CAN RESTORE
THE SUFFERER TO HEALTH.
The people of this country have good cause to
view with alarm an outbreak of influenza, as it
leaves behind it more shattered constitutions than
any other known disease. Mr. Edward Dotting,
for ten years a councillor of the united townships
of Bedford, Olden, and Palmerston, in Frontenac
county Ontario, Canada, is one who nearly fell a
victim to the scourge. To a Whig correspondent
Mr. Botting said“ About two years ago I had
a bad attack of influenza, and the after effects
of that malignant trouble brought me so low
that my friends despaired of my recovery. I was
troubled with severe and constant pains in the
back, sensations of extreme dizziness, weakness,
and was in fact in a generally used-up condition. I
had read frequently of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills,
and felt they must have some special virtues else
they could not obtain such strong endorsations in
all parts of the country. I determined to try
them, and I bless the day that I came to that con-
clusion. Before the first box was finished I felt
benefited, and I continued their use until I was as
strong as ever. I consider Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills the best medicine sold, and I would not be
without them in the house if they cost 5 dollars
a box.
Washing Day.
In this inclement weather, when so many are
suffering from colds, coughs, and rheumatism, the
story of Mrs. Mary Brown, of 71 Simmons-street,
Enmore, Sydney, will be read with devouring
interest.
When a reporter called at this lady’s resi-
dence he found her busily engaged at the wash-
tub, what she called doing a “ day’s washing.” It
was, indeed, difficult to believe by the amount of
“ elbow grease ” she laid into her labors that this
interesting personage had lately been informed by
medical men that here was a case which would
probably develop into chronic rheumatism.
“ I have called, Mrs. Brown,” said the reporter,
“to ascertain the truth of the rumor that has
reached me of your having recently suffered from
a severe attack of rheumatism.”
“ It is quite true, but I am now happy to relate
that I feel as well as I ever did. I have been
suffering on and off from rheumatism for the last
five years, and the slightest change in the weather
used to give me most awful twinges. It chiefly
affected my arms. If it had not been for some of
my friends I could never have got through my
household duties. This complaint appeared to
affect my entire system, and, as the money I had
spent in doctor’s advice and so-called remedies—
why, it makes me positively disgusted to think of.
I began to think that, if my sufferings continued,
life was not worth living. I remember one day,
when reading the Evening News, that an ad-
vertisement caught my eye, headed, ‘ Dr. Wil-
liams’ Pink Pills for Pale People cure Rheumatism,
Sciatica, &c.’ Now, having wasted so much money
already, I was at first loth to try any more adver-
tised medicines, but I thought, ‘ in for a penny in
for a penny,’ so I invested in three boxes of this
specific.
“ My husband laughed at me when I told him I
was going in for a course of Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills, and said, ‘ Oh, you are going to throw away
some more money, are you ? ’
“I said, ‘Yes, I am,’ and right glad am I that
I did so, for I am happy to tell you that they have
done me all the good in the world. Why, I feel
now a brand new woman, and my husband says I
look the ‘ pink ’of perfection now. Not only have
I lost my rheumatic pains, but my appetite has
returned, and I can now enjoy my food. In fact,
my appetite is so good that Brown says I will eat
him out of house and home. This change is all
due to Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills.”
“ How many boxes have you taken, Mrs.
Brown ? ”
“I have had seven boxes in all, and I have so
much belief in them that I intend always to keep
a box by me, and I shall recommend them to all
my friends. You are quite at liberty to publish
this statement, as I believe in giving credit to
whom credit is due.”
Victorian Home Life.
Mrs. Margaret Ross is a fine sample of the class
that has done so much to turn the wastes of in-
land Victoria into “smilinghomesteads.” Origin-
ally she resided at Heathcote, and there, some two
decades since, witnessed the fluctuation of mining
fortune that made the locality historical in Vic-
torian mining annals. Some years later she re-
moved to Alexandra, and in the vicinity of that
pretty township—close to the Acheron —Mrs. Ross
and family lived up to two years since, when,
coming to Melbourne with her husband, they
purchased the well-known grocery store at the
junction of Rathdown and Palmerston streets,
where a representative of the Carlton Gazette
found her ready and willing to discourse on the
immense benefits she had received from a course
of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People. Mrs.
Ross looked the picture of health, and courteously
requested the representative to be seated; and
there was a smile of genuine welcome when his
mission was explained and the history of her par-
ticular malady and its cure solicited.
“Neuralgia,” replied Mrs. Ross, “was the com-
plaint I suffered from for a period of ten or
twelve years. During the day time my sufferings
were painful, but on retiring to rest the agony
I suffered was excruciating, reducing me to a state
of general collapse. I felt it during the day
slightly, but most severely after I got warm at
night. ”
“Did you consult any doctors at all?”
“ Many; but received no permanent benefit.
They gave me draughts and powders, but the
effect was really nothing. ”
“You, of course, have tried other remedies ? ”
“Yes, I tried everything, but obtained no
relief.”
“ What induced you to try Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills for Pale People ? ”
“An elderly lady, resident at Heathcote, 74
years of age, and who had been a sufferer from
rheumatism for 40 years, and who has been abso-
lutely cured by their use, recommended me to try
Pink Pills for Pale People.”
“ How long since might that be ? ”
“Six weeks since—the beginning of July.
During the time I was taking the first box I
lost only one night’s rest; but since then have
never had the least return of the old complaint.”
“ Have you used much of the medicine ? ”
“About four boxes. Previous to my taking
them the pain in my head reduced me to such a
state that I was on the verge of madness. The
last three years I had been very bad, so you can
imagine the pleasure it was to me to find a remedy
that has actually made a new woman of me.
“That is so,’’"remarked Mr. Ross, who was pre-
sent. “ Had you seen my wife a few months since
and now you would scarcely believe her to be the
same woman.”
“ Yes,” rejoined Mrs. Ross, “my recovery has
been most pronounced and satisfactory to me.
I have great faith in Dr. Williams’ Pills for Pale
People, and recommend them wherever possible.”
Congratulating Mrs. Ross on her recovery, and
expressing a hope that she would long live to
enjoy the blessings of good health, the reporter
withdrew.
Washing Baby’s Hair.
Whenever baby’s hair is washed it should be
very carefully dried afterwards. Neglect of this
will frequently give the child a cold in the head,
which if neglected may lay the foundation of a
deafness that will go on increasing until, in later
life, it may become permanent. It is best that
the baby’s hair should be washed at bedtime, so
that there may be no danger of draughts or cold
afterwards.
Bo As You Would Be
Bone By.
Marrickville has not a happier, brighter resi-
dent than Mrs. Edwards, wife of the Marrickville
Town Hall caretaker. Hearing that Mrs. Edwards
for years had been a just sufferer from indigestion
and dyspepsia, a reporter called on her to get
the facts of the case, particularly as he had also
heard that she had suddenly been cured. Mrs.
Edwards very courteously received the representa-
tive, and gave him an account of her ailments and
their cure.
“ First of all,” she proceeded, “ I suffered from
sleeplessness, ringing noises in my head, and an
overbearing pain at my chest. Furthermore, my
appetite failed, and all that would rest on my
stomach was soft food such as milk and arrowroot.
But what alarmed me most was the way my heart
would go pit-a-pat on the very slightest exertion.
I can assure you if I walked a quarter of a mile
these distressing symptoms would come on. This
frightened me very much, for I feared I was suf-
fering from heart disease. As to the remedies I
swallowed, why, their name is legion, but unfor-
tunately no good effects resulted, and I feared my
troubles were neither to be cured nor alleviated.
I consequently began to feel very low and de-
pressed.
“ One day I read of some cures effected by Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People, and indeed
it proved a joyous day for me. I determined to
try a few boxes of this specific, bought them, and
commenced to take them according to the direc-
tions which I noticed were around each box.
After the first two boxes I felt a decided improve-
ment, and decided to continue with this medicine.
As I persevered with the treatment I made satis-
factory progress.”
“ You said that your heart gave you consider-
able anxiety, Mrs. Edwards.”
“ Yes, I was afraid it was diseased, and I'm
glad to find I was mistaken. It took a little time
to pull me together again, for you must remember
I had sunk very low ; but I am happy to st ite that
I am fairly on my feet again, and am so .satisfied
that this cure has been effected by Dr. William#’
Pink Pills for Pale People that I have recom-
mended them to all my friends. Yes, yon are at
perfect liberty to publish this testimonial, for I
consider it a duty that I owe to the world at
large.”
Anyone with a particle of sympathy in his com-
position will readily concede that life under the
circumstances narrated in Mrs. Edwards’ case is
a failure, and death holds little terror for one so
situated. Imagine even such an existence, and
the thought brings terror with it. It is like bear-
ing a heavy load with little strength to manage it,
consequent upon the denial of food and sleep. No
wonder the heart rebels and seems determined
upon bursting bounds.
To Cure Rheumatism.
More cases of rheumatism than of any other
disorder prevalent at this time of the year have
been cured by Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale
People. They act by strengthening the blood and
nerves ; people subject to rheumatism should use
them at once. These Pills have cured numerous
cases of other disorders which arise from im-
poverished blood, such as muscular weakness, loss
of appetite, shortness of breath, pain in the back,
nervous headache, and all forms of female weak-
ness, paralysis, locomoter ataxy, sciatica, influenza,
anaemia, and palpitations. You can buy them at
the chemists, but take care that the package bears
the full name, Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale
People, and in case of doubt send direct to Dr.
Williams’ Medicine Company, Queen’s Chambers,
Queen’s-place, Sydney,
as the Pills can be had
post free at 2s. 9d., or
six boxes for 15s. 3d.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
for Pale People are not
apurgati ve, they are not
like other medicine, nor
can they be imitated,
as is sometimes dis-
honestly pretended.
Pills sold loose, or from
glass jars, are not Dr.
Williams’; don’t accept
them.

FREE TO READERS OF “THE BULLE-
TIN.”
If you are n»b well, and do not understand your
ailment; if you are ill and wish to be well, write
an account of your case to the Dr. Williams’
Medicine Company, Queens-chambers, Queens-
place, Sydney, and ask whether Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills are good for your case. If they are
not you will be told ; if they are, you will no
doubt hear of other cases like your own that have
been cured by this medicine. Mention the name
of this paper, and you will have a prompt reply.
Important to Mothers.
What can be more distressing than to see a girl
drooping and fading in the springtime of youth ?
Instead of bright eyes, glowing rosy cheeks, and
an elastic step, there are dull eyes, pale, sallow,
and greenish complexion, and a languidness
of step that bespeaks disease and an early death
if proper treatment is not promptly resorted to
and persisted in until the impoverished blood is
enriched and the functions of life become regular.
TO PARENTS AND GUARDIANS.
Upon parents rests a great responsibility at the
time their daughters are budding into womanhood
If your daughter is pale, complains of weakness,
is “ tired out ” upon the slightest exertion ; if she
is troubled with headache, backache, pain in the
side ; if her temper is fitful, and her appetite poor,
she is in a condition of extreme peril, a fit subject
for the development of that most dreaded of all
diseases—consumption. If you notice any of these
symptoms, lose no time in procuring Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills. They will assist the patient to develop
properly -and regularly ; they will enrich the
blood, and restore health’s roses to the cheek, and
all dangers of consumption and premature death
will be averted. Wise and prudent mothers will
insist upon their daughters taking Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills upon the approach of the period of
womanhood, and thus avoid the risks of disease
or early decay.
Bale and Bloodless.
Mrs. Boyd, of Darvel, Ayrshire, Scotland, who
was interviewed with her husband, by a special
correspondent of the Ayr Observer, may be
said to have obtained a new lease of life through
the instrumentality of Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills. “ I have seen my wife,” said her
husband, “ like that wall (pointing to a wall
which was practically colorless), but now she
is herself again. As the old Scotch saying is, Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills have been a ‘ God-send ’ to
us.” For seven years, Mrs. Boyd had suffered
frightfully from pains in her body, aggravated by
tortures of neuralgia in the head, and benumbing of
the limbs. In her own words she “was mad with
suffering.” Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, however,
restored her health, appetite, and nerves, and
brought back the colour to her face.
Sparkling Eyes and Rosy Cheeks.
The acquisition of perfect health is the aim of
everyone. A few remarks, therefore, on the sub-
ject will be acceptable to all young ladies who are
not the happy possessors of sparkling eyes and
rosy cheeks. Mrs. Bowe, of North Maldon, Vic-
toria, whose daughter, Miss May, had been
seriously ill for some time, gives the following
account of her restoration to health and strength
again :
“ My daughter had been strong and healthy
until almost two years ago, when she grew very
pale and thin. She became weak and low spirited,
lost her appetite ; her sleep was -troubled and
restless, and the least exertion fatigued her—in
fact, she had to take her sister’s arm for support
when out walking. She was of a wonderfully active
and cheerful disposition before this change took
place, and the
a Iteration,
therefore,
caused us
great con-
cern, and
medical aid
was sought,
but no good
resulted. Se-
veral medi-
cines were
tried, but she
became
weaker and
more listless
every day.
The doctor
said she was
suffering
from anaemia
or poorness
of blood.
We then became seriously alarmed, and con-
sulted different medical men, who prescribed
and told Miss May to take as much exer-
cise as possible. She, being fond of flowers,
naturally turned her attention to the garden,
but had to abandon the work, as the least
exertion exhausted her. Often, when I thought
she was out taking exercise in the fresh air I have
found her in the drawing-room with her head
resting on her hands, and in a somnolent state.
Then, when disturbed, she would steal quietly to
her room, and remain there for hours at time. At
this stage we became extremely anxious concern-
ing her health, and again sought medical advice,
as°we thought she was going into a decline. It
was of no use though, nothing did her any good.
She was then so thin and weak that the slightest
exertion tired her. She also suffered from severe
cramps in the legs. .
“ Friends then recommended patent medicines,
and two or three kinds were tried unsuccessfully.
“At last I decided to take her away to the
country for a change, but just as I was about to do
so I saw in the Tarrangower Times an advertise-
ment about Dr. Williams 3 Pink Pills for Pale
People, and noticing that people with symptoms
similar to those of my daughter had been cured, I
determined to give them a trial.
“ After using half-a-box a great improvement
was noticeable, and after using three boxes she
regained her appetite, was able to sleep with com-
fort, and was so strong and well that we con-
sidered there was no necessity for her continuing
to take Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. So she discon-
tinued them. I honestly believe my daughter’s
recovery was due to this great remedy. She is
now as well as ever she was in her life. She has a
fine color, is able to eat and sleep well, and can
take any amount of outdoor. exercise without feel-
ing fatigue. I feel very grateful to Dr. Williams
for my daughter’s recovery, and _ would like to
have the case made known, as it may induce
others who suffer as my daughter did to try this
remedy to their benefit, and thus perhaps bring
sunshine and happiness to their homes.”
Great satisfaction has been expressed by Miss
Bowe’s large circle of friends that she is again
enjoying good health, and able to take her accus'
toined plaee at local social gatherings.

An’ huts for travellers to doss
Built all across the plain.
The saltbush there has spread an’ riz
Until the track’s obscure ;
An’ fifty sheep an acre is
A thing they reckon poor.
So we’re off to the Speewaa, where the bush grows
wide,
Crossing the track till a man can hardly ride ;
We’re full up o’ foolin’ in a backyard run,
So we're polin’ off to Speewaa, where the game ain t
done.
They keep on lambin’ all the year
An’ yet they never lose.
A one per cent, o’ what they rear
And half a hundred ewes.
An’ though there’s twenty million sheep
That wear the Speewaa brand,
You’ll never find a dozen dead
In all .the Speewaa land.
So we’re off to the Speewaa where the sheep are
tough ;
We’ve stuck to other stations quite long enough.
But now we’ve got some sense at last — you’ll see us
step it out
For Speewaa in the Never, where there ain’t no
drought.
The boss has whips o’ stuff about,
An’ miles an’ miles o’ land ;
He’d buy old Jimmy Tyson out,
An’ sell up Hungry Rand.
He keeps the pound-a-himdr.-1 pay
With all the chaps he’s got,
An’ leaves it ter themselves ter say
If sheep are wet or not.
So we're off to the Speewaa, where there’s bunce to
scoff,
With pay at union prices an' the boss a real toff ;
No more thirty bob a week for twelve hours’ graft a
day,
We’ll start at the Speewaa on the good old pay.
The huts are painted pinks and blues,
With mirrors on the walls,
An’ niggers hurry in with booza
When any shearer calls.
There’s plates o’ icecream in the shed,
An’ on the hottest days
Long shandies with a foamin’ head
Are handed round on trays.
So we're off to the Speewaa where the fun’s all right ;
There’s a grim' planner tootin’ in the huts at night,
And a dandy girl ter play it, *oo, with lovely goldiny
hair ;
So we're off to the Speewaa where they treat yer fair.
So give us just a kiss or two,
And wish us luck ahead ;
In six months we’ll be safely through,
Or else we’ll both be dead.
But we ain’t goin’ ter feed no crow,
Nor meet no sudden ends,
An’ when we’re back ye’ll never know
Ye had such toffs for friends.
So collar the hilly an' pick up the swag again,
We're goin’ to pad the same old hoof across the same
old plain ;
But cornin' hack /—just look at us a-drivin' four-in-
hand ;
For we’ll make our piles at Speewaa in the Never
Never Land.

■ Bourke, N.S.W.) Algerian date-palms, four years
old, are bearing fruit. Quidnuncs said they would
need 14 years at least. Superintendent Gorman

results, but admits that soda and sun solidify

Alice Springs, pretty close to the centre of
Australia, which the overlanding cyclists from
Port Darwin to Adelaide make their half-way
house, is about the most interesting far-back
township in Australia. It is in the heart of the
Mao Donnell Ranges—a big chain 400 miles or so
long, forming the continent’s backbone—which
are being slowly explored for gold, mica, and
other things. All round is sandy desert; but the
ranges themselves consist of alternating rocky
peaks and saddles and wonderfully fertile flats.
Some of the rock formations are most fantastic,
and many wildly-picturesque springs and rocky
water-holes and caves with native drawings have
been discovered. The climate is pretty good ;
and the blacks, who are fairly numerous, belong
mostly to the Arunto tribe, over whom Station-
master Gillen, the boss of these parts, has won
m'uch influence. Further back in the ranges,
however, the natives are troublesome : they, last
month, compelled an Adelaide-Broken Hill pro-
specting party to retreat. So far as prospecting is
concerned, the place suffers sadly from the want
of expert assistance—and its 1200 miles from the
capital, of course.
The Fat Woman .
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Old Devine wiped the dishes carefully, and then
came back to the little window that opened into
the bar. An 18st. woman filled the draughty door-
way ; in her apron half-a-dozen apples, a packet
of sweets and some gingerbreads—the pick of an
Italian’s basket. She lay back in a canvas chair
at peace with the world. Old Devine opened the
window slightly and listened. Above the zmg-
zing of locusts and the buzz of flies came a
crunch, crunch, and smacking of lips; shifting a
little, he saw the slow-moving jowl and the fat
relaxing under her left ear. A nervous tremor
shot across his face. He closed the window
hurriedly. “ Morning and night—morning and
night. God! how she eats ! ”
The pub. was built on the edge of a creek where
the bridge joined the great white road running
east and west. Men and boys, often women,
tramped over it all the year round. Some of them
stopped at Devine’s, and some dragged their
starved bodies to the stinking lagoon opposite.
A man limps to the door, nodding carelessly to
the fat woman, and squeezes past into the bar.
Already she has noted wire in his boots and string
in his clothes. Suddenly he makes up his mind.
‘Beer —one long beer.”
His overbearing confidence jars; she has seen it
before —a, mere pitfall for the inexperienced. A
harsh demand for sixpence down slews him round.
“ I was about to mention it. To-morrow I pass
here at 11.30 ; you will be paid.”
The fat woman appears to forget him ; her eyes
dose, her fingers drop amongst the gingerbreads.
He reflects.
Beer costs a fraction under twopence. To-mor-
row she is paid 6d.—cent, per cent, twice over
times are dull; a few would snap at it.
“ Yes or no? ” No answer except a crunch and
a gurgle. . .
“ Yes or no ? ” His voice is calm.
“ No.” „
“ Half-a-glass, then. I’ve walked 20 miles.
She falls into a doze. He smites his hands
cheerfully.
“ Look here, old girl, I’ll ask you once more.
Half-a-glass, and Tommy will pay you when he
comes home.”
“ What Tommy ? ”
He faces her a little irritably.
“Your son Tommy ; met him on the ’Bidgee in
’9o—fed him, carried his swag, and paid his score
manv a time. Lord strike me dead ! ”
She folds her arms, nodding at every word.
“On the ’Bidgee in ’9O. A fine couple you’d
make ; he’d run up scores ; you’d come in out of
the rain. A pair of lovely birds.”
“ Some mothers like to hear now and then,” he
ventured.
“ Eight years and never a line,” she muttered.
Then, half savagely, “Every tug on the road
knows him, and every damned one walks from the
Gulf to Menindie to find me out. You’re the fifth
bummer this year.”
After this outburst she consoles herself with an
apple ; strange gurglings follow. Then in a man’s
voice she breaks oat—“ Did he ever tell you about
Emily?” The stranger thought he had.
“Ah he did, eh ? She was a white-faced chit,
anyhow, and I found her in the gutter and tried to
bring her up. We all make mistakes. You ough#
to have seen her before she grew up—-nothing but
a God-forsaken whimpering little ghost a Chow
wouldn’t tread on ; and the crawling mita springs
into a full-lipped, big-bosomed woman before you
could wink. ‘Keep your eye on Tommy! sez Ito
myself, ‘and a whip-hand on her.’ Young man,
X was born slow, she had him running after her in
no time. I stopped it! ”
“ You stopped it! ” reiterated the man.
“ You bet. What right had she to him ? ”
“Go on.” , . ,
The fat woman lay back breathing heavily.
“ I gave her notice to quit. It was my only
chance, and Tommy was away at the time.
Having suspicions, I called in a trooper the day
she was leaving. We searched her box six silver
spoons and a heap of my linen. I pressed the
“ And now you’re happy ? ” His fingers played
in a reddish beard.
She nodded. “You’d better have that drink
now ; I didn’t intend ...” She floundered from
the chair, revolving slowly into the bar.
“ Beer you said : if ”
» * * *
He had slipped out and was walking swiftly
away. Something gripped his arm. He faced
old Devine. . „
“My God! Tommy, I knew your voice. How
you sold her ! ” He looked into his son s brooding
face ; his own was lit up and feverish. .
“ You’re coming back, Tommy, now. ihings
ain’t so bad.” . . . , .
Tommy’s lips screwed into an unmistakable
“ ’Dad, it would mean hell to me. Think of it:
she planted things in Emily’s box, and I never
guessed the truth till Don’t, Dad—don t
make it worse. Good-bye ! ”
* * * *
The old man stared under his shaking palm at
the ragged sleeve making farewell gestures from
the middle of the road. He hurried back feebly
to where the fat woman was staring across the
dull red plain.

An Oversight of Steelman's.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Steelman and Smith —professional wanderers—
were making back for Wellington, M.L., down
through the wide and rather dreary-looking Hutt
Valley. They were “ broke.” They carried their
few remaining belongings in two skimpy, ama-
teurish-looking swags. Steelman had fourpence
left. They were very tired and very thirsty—at
least Steelman was, and he answered for both.
It was Smith’s policy to feel and think just
exactly as Steelman did. Said Steelman—
“ The landlord of the next pub. is not a bad
sort. I won’t go in—he might remember me.
You’d best go in. You’ve been tramping round
in the Wairarapa district for the last six months,
looking for work. You’re going back to Welling-
ton now, to try and get on the new corporation
works just being started there—the sewage works.
You think you’ve got a show. You’ve got some
mates in Wellington, and they’re looking out for
a chance for you. You did get a job last week on
a sawmill at Silverstream, and the boss sacked
you after three days and wouldn’t pay you a penny.
That’s just his way. I know him—at least a
mate of mine does. I’ve heard of him often
enough. His name’s Cowman. Don’t forget the
name, whatever you do. The landlord on here
hates him like poison ; he’ll sympathise with you.
Tell him you’ve got a mate with you; he’s gone
on ahead—took a short cut across the paddocks.
Tell him you’ve only got fourpence left, and see if
he’ll give you a drop in a bottle. Says you :
‘ Well, boss, the fact is we’ve only got fourpence,
but you might let us have a drop in a bottle ’; and
very likely he’ll stand you a couple of pints in a
gin-bottle. You can fling the coppers on the
counter, but the chances are he won’t take them.
He’s not a bad sort. Beer’s fourpence a pint out
here, same’s in Wellington. See that gin-bottle
lying there by the stump; get it and we’ll take it
down to the river with us and rinse it out.”
They reached the river bank.
“You’d better take my swag—it looks itiore
decent,” said Steelman. “ No, I’ll tell you what
we’ll do: we’ll undo both swags and make them
into one—one decent swag, and I’ll cut round
through the lanes and wait for you on the road
ahead of the pub.”
He rolled up the swag with much care and
deliberation and considerable judgment. He
fastened Smith’s belt round one end of it, and the
handkerchiefs round the other and made a towel
serve as a shoulder-strap.
“I wish we had a canvas bag to put it in,” he
said, “ora cover of some sort. But never mind.
The landlord’s an old Australian bushman, now I
come to think of it ; the swag looks Australian
enough, and it might appeal to his feelings, you
know—bring up old recollections like. But you’d
best not say you come from Australia, because he’s
been there, and he’d soon trip you up. He might
have been where you’ve been, you know, so don’t
try to do too much. You always do mug-up the
business when you try to do more than I tell you.
You might tell him your mate came from Aus-
tralia—but no, he might want you to bring me in.
Better stick to Maoriland. I don’t believe in too
much ornamentation. Plain lies are the best.”
“ What’s the landlord’s name ? ” asked Smith.
“Never mind that. You don’t want to know
that. You are not supposed to know him at all.
It might look suspicious if you called him by his
name, and lead to awkward questions ; then you’d
be sure to put your foot into it.”
“ I could say I read it over the door.”
“ Bosh. Travellers don’t read the names over
the doors, when they go into pubs. You’re an
entire stranger to him. Call him ‘ Boss.’ Say
‘ Good-day, Boss,’ when you go in, and swing down
your swag as if you’re used to it. Ease it down
like this. Then straighten yourself up, stick your
hat back, and wipe your forehead, and try to look
as hearty and independent and cheerful as you pos-
sibly can ! Curse the Government and say the
country’s done ! It don’t matter what Govern-
ment it is, for he’s always against it. I never
knew a real Australian that wasn’t. Say that
you’re thinking about trying to get over to Aus-
tralia, and then listen to him talking about it—
and try to look interested, too ! Get that damned
stone-deaf expression off your face ! . . . He’ll
run Australia down most likely (I never knew an
Other-sider that had settled down over here who
didn’t). But don't you make any mistake and
agree with him, because, although successful
Australians over here like to run their own
country down, there’s very few of them that care to
hear anybody else do it. . . . Don’t come away
as soon as you get your beer. Stay and listen to him
for awhile, as if you’re interested in his yarning,
and give him time to put you on to a job, or offer
you one. Give him a chance to ask how you and
your mate are off for tobacco or tucker. Like as
not he’ll sling you half-a-crown when you come
away—that is if you work it all right. Now' try to
think of something to say to him, and make your-
self a bit interesting—if you possibly can. Tell
him about the fight we saw back at the pub. the
other day. He might know some of the chaps.
This is a sleepy hole, and there ain’t much news
knocking round. ... I wish I could go in
myself, but lie’s sure to remember me. I’m afraid
he got left the last time I stayed there (so did one
or two others); and, besides, I came away without
saying good-bye to him, and he might feel a bit
sore about it. That’s the worst of travelling on
the old road. Come on now', wake up ! ”
“ Bet I’ll get a quart,” said Smith, brightening
up, “ and some tucker for it to wash down.”
“If you don’t,” said Steelman, “I’ll stoush
you. Never mind the bottle ; fling it away. It
doesn’t look well for a traveller to go into a pub.
with an empty bottle in his hand. A real swag-
man never does. It looks much better to come
out with a couple of full ones. That’s what you’ve
got to do. Now, come along.”
Steelman turned off into a lane, cut across the
paddocks to the road again, and waited for Smith.
He hadn’t long to wait.
Smith went on towards the public-house, re-
hearsing his part as he walked—repeating his
“ lines ” to himself so as to be sure of remember-
ing all that Steelman had told him to say to the
landlord, and adding, with what he considered
appropriate gestures, some fancy touches of his
own, which he determined to throw in in
spite of Steelman’s advice and warning., ‘l’ll
tell him (this)—l’ll tell him (that). Well, look
here, boss, I’ll say you’re pretty right and I quite
agree with you as far as that’s concerned, but,”
&c. And so, murmuring and mumbling to him-
self, Smith reached the hotel. The day was late,
and the bar was small, and low, and dark. Smith
walked in with all the assurance he could muster,
eased down his swag in a corner in what he no
doubt considered the true professional style, and,
swinging round to the bar, said in a loud voice
which he intended to be cheerful, independent and
hearty:
“ Good-day, boss ! ”
But it wasn’t a “boss.” It was about the
hardest-faced old woman that Smith had ever
seen. The pub. had changed hands.
♦ • * *
“I—l beg your pardon, missus,” stam-
mered poor Smith.
It was a knock-down blow for Smith. He
couldn’t come to time. He and Steelman had had
a landlord in their minds all the time, and laid
their plans accordingly; the possibility of having a
she—and one like this—to deal with never entered
into their calculations. Smith had no time to
reorganise, even if he had the brains to do so,
without the assistance of his mate’s knowledge of
human nature.
“ I I beg your pardon, missus,” he stammered.
Painful pause. She sized him up.
“ Well, what do you want? ”
“ Well, missus—l—the fact is—will you give me
a bottle of beer for fourpence ? ”
“ Wha —what? ”
‘ ‘ I mean . The fact is, we’ve only got four-
pence left, and—l’ve got a mate outside, and you
might let us have a quart or so, in a bottle, for
that . I mean—anyway, you might let us
have a pint. I’m very sorry to you, missus.”
But she couldn’t do it. No. Certainly not.
Decidedly not. All her drinks were sixpence.
She had her license to pay, and the rent, and a
family to keep. It wouldn’t pay out there—it
wasn’t worth her while. It wouldn’t pay the cost
of carting the liquor out, &c., &c.
“ Well, missus,” poor Smith blurted out at last,
in sheer desperation, “ give me what you can in a
bottle for this. I’ve —I’ve got a mate outside.”
And he put the four coppers on the bar.
“ Have you got a bottle ? ”
“ No—but ”
“If I give you one, will you bring it back?
You can’t expect me to give you a bottle as well
as a drink.”
“Yes, mum ; I’ll bring it back directly.”
She reached out a bottle from under the bar,
and very deliberately measured out a little over
a pint and poured it into the bottle, which she
handed to Smith without a cork.
Smith went his way without rejoicing. It
struck him forcibly'that he should have saved the
money until they reached Petone, or the city,
where Steelman would be sure to get a decent
drink. But how was he (Smith) to know ? He
had chanced it, and lost; Steelman might have
done the same. What troubled Smith most was
the thought of what Steelman would say; he
already heard him, in imagination, saying:
You re a mug, Smith—Smith, you are a mug.”
But Steelman didn 5 t say much. He was pre-
pared for the worst by seeing Smith come along so
soon. He listened to his story with an air of
gentle sadness, even as a stern father might listen
to the voluntary confession of a wayward child •
then he held the bottle up to the fading light of
departing day, looked through it (the bottle), and
said :
* Well - it ain’t worth while dividing it.”
Smith s heart sank right down through a hole
in the sole of his left boot into the hard road.
Here, Smith,” said Steelman, handing him
the bottle, “ Drink it, old man, you want it. It
wasn t altogether your fault; it! was an oversight
of mine. I didn t bargain for a woman of that
kind and of course, you couldn’t be expected to
think of it. Drink it! Drink it down, Smith,

Smith was forced to believe his ears, and, re-
covering from his surprise, he drank.

“Shortly after leaving Johannesburg, where we had resided several
vears, I contracted a fever, which left me in a very weak state. I was a
long time without any improvement, and none of the various remedies 1
tried, under the doctor’s direction, did me any good. My husband finally
persuaded me to try Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, which cured several acquaintances
of ours who had suffered from impoverished blood and general debility. I
therefore began to take the Sarsaparilla, and its good influence was soon
apparent. Within less than a month I was as well as ever, and could eat
and sleep like a child. Gratefully yours,

Mr. Henry Forbes writes in confirmation of his wife’s testimony, and
adds that he had suffered from dyspepsia and loss of appetite, and that he
was cured by
