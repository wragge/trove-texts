IN "SUSSEX BY THE SEA" STANDS MIGHTY-WALLED BODIAM
gODIAM Castle in Sussex is one of the finest and certainly one
of the most picturesque castles in England; it is situated on
the River Rother, which here forms the boundary between Kent
an as . se * - . . . , ,_ ,
, 18 10rtress owes , its origin in 1386 to Sir Edward Dalyn-
grudge, a veteran oi Agmcourt who served with credit under the
Black Prince. It was designed upon a French type of castle which
was becoming popular in England at that time—a high embattled
wall, strengthened at intervals with towers around a quadrangular
space: Stirling and Tantallion Castles were later examples of this
style. Bodiam was built in the middle of a lake connected with the
River Rother, thus forming a wide and deep moat which added to
its essential qualities for effective defence.
The moat, spanned by a causeway, was defended by an
ingenious system of bridges and small gateways terminating in a
barbican, now partly dismantled. On the south side the postern
leading to the moat was defended by a massive square tower, being
one n j ne j n a y surro unding the enclosure with three portcullises,

In the rei 8 n of Rlchard 111 the castle underwent a siege by the
Earl of Surrey and was dismantled during the Civil War. The
interior is now an empty shell, although the remains of the kitchen,
chapel and chief apartments can still be traced. In 1917 this fine
old castle was bought by the late Lord Curzon, and at his expense
it was carefully repaired. After his death it passed to the National
Trust for posterity.

EARTH AND FLOWER.
One has only to read the opening para-
graph of any of Myra Morris’s stories
in The Township (Angus and Robertson)
to be reminded that, besides novels and
short stories, Myra Morris has written
attractive lyrical poetry. Take, for in-
stance, the charming piece of prose with
which the book begins:
In the hazy summer afternoon the town-
ship lay soft and somnolent. The very air
caught in the valley between the pale,
wooded hills seemed drugged and heavy.
There was no movement on the lush green
flats behind the station yard. The cows
were motionless, like painted animals on
painted pastures, and along the meandering
river the heads of pollarded willows, ash-
gold, ash-silver, floated like tethered clouds.
We come, after this poetic opening, to
the story of a person named Freddie, who
won’t work and who is at once the pride
and the despair of his wife Lil; and the
enchanted, sleepy town, we learn, is a
Ipnd of Circe, luring men like Freddie
into lives of swinish ease . . . “There
was something the schoolmaster had said,
something about the damp-rot of Musk
Valley, and the moss-grown trees.”
This, insofar as it is fair to generalise
about a collection of 20 stories, rich in
variety, is the underlying theme of The
Township; the contrast between a flower-
ing landscape and its very earthy people ;
almost, one might say, a theme of “where
every prospect pleases and only man is
vile.” The book’s second story, to take
another example, opens with the land-
scape :
Mile after mile the orchards lay blackly
together under the moon. Hidden away in
small paddocks at the back of sheds, be-
hind the skeleton clusters of orchard
machinery, ploughs and spray-pumps and
tractors, the sheep huddled crying plain-
tively. The sound of their bleating, waver-
ing and uncertain, filled the night, seeming
to come from no point of earth in par-
ticular, but from out of the wandering air
that flowed over the fruit-blocks and the
channels and the straight, dusty roads to-
wards the sleeping township.
And here, on the enchanted and sleeping
earth, among the fruitful orchards, we
have the story of a derelict named Jim
Baker whose dog Yaller is a killer of
sheep. The “prospect” pleases; and Jim
Baker and his dog, if hardly portrayed
as vile, are certainly earthy.
Except for a certain lack of sharpness,
hard to define, these stories —and the rest
in the book—hardly call, in themselves,
for criticism. The Township is an ex-
ceptionally attractive collection. But,
considering the contrast between the
lyrical landscapes and the beaten-down
if not defeated people—a contrast, for
all the author’s determined and some-
times forced cheerfulness, slightly melan-
.choly in its final effect —one wonders at
at times whether Myra Morris has been
writing the kind of stories that she really
would like to, the kind best suited to
her essentially feminine talent.
It may be, simply, that she is using
such material as life has offered her,
realistically portraying a countryside in
which most of the people, if not the
earth itself, have become somewhat
eroded by time. But an artist chooses
—deliberately selects, even from the small
population of a country town —the people
of a novel or a short story ; and chooses,
too, consciously or unconsciously, the
viewpoint from which their stories are
to be told. And so it may be that Myra
Morris is, to a degree, affected by fashion
and tradition in the Australian short story.
As all Australian stories, by tradition,
are about the Bush, so are Myra
Morris’s; as all Australian stories are
about the less dignified denizens of the
Bush—hatters and derelicts —so are Myra
Morris’s ; as all Australian writers find
it difficult to speak of the “middle” or
“upper” classes without a kind of demo-
cratic acidity, so Myra Morris, though
she is reasonably detached as well as
amusing about the Mrs. Ochiltree who
built a fountain in memory of a scape-
grace husband who had populated the
district with red-headed illegitimate sons,
seems forced to take the side of a mad
old woman whom a social-worker
with a hyphenated name is trying
to remove from her shack to a home for
the. aged ... It is practically impossible
for a character with a hyphenated name
to do well in Australian fiction. And so
we have, perhaps, an essential lyrical
talent, like Chekhov’s and like Katherine
Mansfield’s, working, not wholly at ease,
in the tradition of Henry Lawson and
the flat realists of later days.
One is tempted to say that these are
stories about the wrong sort of people:
degenerates. And that may be partly
true. But all Myra Morris’s people would
have served Chekhov well enough; it
is the viewpoint from which they are
presented, the tone, that makes them seem
crude, even a little repellent at times.
There is obviously a complete change of
tone when, after the landscape is de-
scribed, the writer turns to humanity.
It is a poetic Myra Morris who writes:
The road was close to the sand at this
part, close to the inlets and the tussocky
grass and the silver-grey bushes with their
tiny yellow balls. Back a little from the
dark braids of water, lilies grew thickly,
clump after clump. They looked odd in
such a place. No one knew how they had
first come, but they were there every spring
with their shapely leaves and pale, rounded
trumpets pierced with gold.
And it is quite a different Myra Morris,
admirably capable but far more prosaic,
who goes on to describe the moony
peasant-girl, the chirpy salesman and the
smalltown religious fanatics of “Rub with
a Circular Motion.”
It may be because of this change of
vision, this lowering of intensity, that one
or two of the stories—“ Sheep in the
Orchards,” for instance, where the author
suggests for an instant that the old man
may want his dog to kill sheep and then
fails to follow and dramatise this clue
to his character —do not ring finally true.
And it is almost certainly because of
fashion that the girl who tempts the
parson to destruction in the book’s best
and most powerful story, “The Parson,”
is a conventional bush slattern who brings
a somewhat squalid note into the story
and who seems hardly the type to attract
the sensitive and tormented man Myra
Morris has portrayed.
Throughout The Township one sees
Myra Morris moving towards a gay or
a dramatic or a fantastic or a poetic
type of story opposed to her general
pattern of realism. There is genuine
tragic intensity in “The Parson” ; there
are humor and imagination in “A Better,
Brighter Town,” and an exhilarating
moment transcending mere realism when
a wife reflects on her much henpecked
husband, “Mild as he was, there had
always been a queer, mad look in his
eyes, especially when he wore a large-
crowned hat that came too far down
over his ears, and when he was brandish-
ing the bacon-knife before cutting a side
into rashers” ; and if both “Vision in
the Forest” and “Bus Ride” are marred
by magazinish endings, it is distinctly
interesting to meet a swaggie who
has once been a bank-clerk and a spin-
ster who, by mistake, has gone off for the
day with a bus-load of nudists. In “Go-
ing Home,” describing a wife’s return
from hospital with her baby, Myra Morris
has a story which, thcfugh dealing with
uncultivated people, remains poetic
throughout, and in “Ferns,” despite some
lack of conviction in a scene of panic in
the bush, a delightful picture, quite with-
out false democratic sentiment, of a
middle-class spinster who has a passion
for pot-plants.
It is these stories, together with the
beautiful descriptions not only of land-
scape, but of people—the child, for in-
stance, who had “hairy arms decorated
with silver and bone bangles that tinkled
when she hopped”—that lift The Town-
ship, good as it is within its pattern of
realism, into a higher, more imaginative
category of art. They make one eager
to see what Myra Morris could do if she
broke fr<ie from the Lawson pattern to
that wild and essentially feminine kind
of art made by Virginia Woolf, Sylvia
Townsend Warner, Christina Stead,
Katherine Mansfield and Eve Langley. It
is time for her people, as her earth has
already done, to break into flower.
The Police Dogs.
Except for a tinge of morbidity C. Bede
Maxwell’s The Cold Nose of the Law
(Angus and Robertson) is a wholly pleas-
ing piece of documentary writing. And
the morbidity is not Mrs. Maxwell’s
fault —in fact, she says herself that she
regrets it—but is inevitable in a book
dealing with the police dogs of New South
Wales.
The dogs, when they are not walking
tight-ropes or jumping through hoops of
fire or, incredibly, demonstrating to the
public at carnivals how they will obey the
commands of a portable radio strapped
to their backs —this was Zoe’s star turn —
have been most sensationally employed
on hunting down sex perverts, escaped
murderers and escaped criminal lunatics.
Mrs. Maxwell, consequently, faithfully
following the dogs, is obliged to retell
some unpleasant stories, particularly
about the murders of children.
But there is no lingering over the sordid
or the terrible ; and the book, by bringing
these stories into prominence, might con-
ceivably do some good—if anything can
persuade “humanitarian” Labor Govern-
ments, rigid in their conservatism, that
it is unwise to release sex criminals to
perpetrate further crimes and that to pre-
serve the lives of murderers is a betrayal
of the community.
In the book as a whole these patches of
sordidness are more than balanced by the
good taste with which Mrs. Maxwell
handles them, by the more attractive feats
of tracking the dogs perform, by the ex-
ceptional interest of the story as an obser-
vation of canine intelligence, and, especi-
ally, by the comic note brought in when-
ever the bloodhound Disraeli appears.
Disraeli, tracking with his “snuffling,
gulping, snorting roar, audible at a con-
siderable distance,” is an extraordinarily
engaging animal. He reminds one of Dr.
Watson. Or even, unkindly in the present
circumstances for Mrs. Maxwell’s
policemen are an intelligent and likeable
company—of the typical village constable
of detective stories. Disraeli has a blind
devotion to duty, an invincible dogged-
ness and, so it sometimes appears, no
brains whatsoever. He is a perfect ex-
ample of the single-track mind.
Duty, as Disraeli understands it, is to
track. And track he does, snuffling and
roaring over rough mountain country at
night at a speed which takes no account
of the difficulties of the unfortunate police
officer he is towing behind him. And
when he comes to the edge of a cliff, over
which a woman has plunged to suicide,
his one idea is to continue tracking. He
has to be forcibly restrained from com-
mitting suicide himself and taking his
keeper with him. Mrs. Maxwell portrays
him memorably at Wentworth Falls in
the N. S. Wales Blue Mountains when he
has tracked a lost young man to
the lookout over the famous Weeping
Rock. There the fall is so long and so
precipitous that the water that goes over
the top as a solid sheet reaches the bottom
as a floating veil of spray. Disraeli pon-
dered long and deeply, his very wrinkles
gouged with the seriousness of his thoughts.
Presently he apparently reached the reason-
able conclusion. His quarry had jumped
down, fallen down, overbalanced —or, at
least, he was no longer there. Obviously,
then, he had gone on in some manner
He put his forepaws carefully in position
on the fence and commenced to draw up
his hindquarters. “Look out! He’s going
over! ” someone shouted. That certainly
was Disraeli’s intention, and he did not
’propose to be thwarted. It cost Denholm
several minutes of strenuous handling before
he was able to convince the hound that he
would not be permitted to climb over the
fence and follow his quarry.
Disraeli, displaying the same captivat-
ing mixture of intelligence and stupidity,
once broke away from the searchers when
looking for a small boy lost in the bush.
“He made off at a great pace, stern wav-
ing high, nose down, leash dragging.”
After a while he reappeared and, at ease
with the world, wanted to curl up and
go to sleep:
They looked at him with disgust. “He’s
found the youngster, and he’s quite satis-
fied. But what about us?”
Attempts were made to induce the hound
to take the trail again, but these met only
with failure. Disraeli would not budge.
His eyes sagged shut and he wobbled
sleepily.
It is only fair to Disraeli to record that,
by following the direction he had taken,
the searchers on that occasion found the
lost boy, who told them that that dog had
come up, licked him and then “he went
away again.” Also, it might be added
that a man lost in the Blue Mountains and
found by Disraeli threw his arms around
the bloodhound and kissed him.
Few people, no doubt, even if rescued
in French’s Forest on a stormy night, have
ventured to kiss the police Alsatians.
And, despite Mrs. Maxwell’s eloquent
defence of the breed, and one’s unstinted
admiration for them as officers of the law,
it is difficult to regard an animal with
such large teeth, if owned by someone
else, as a bosom friend. Alsatians are not
neighborly dogs. In fact, Mrs. Maxwell’s
suggestion—-facetious, one hopes—that
Alsatians should be used to control
Sydney crowds on days of carnival is
positively monstrous. Man was not born
to be pushed around by dogs.
Unless, of course, he has committed
some barbarous crime that puts him out-
side humanity. If, like one of the maniacs
described in The ( Cold Nose of the Law,
he has murdered a child and put its body
in a sack in a creek then he may well
deserve to have the redoubtable Tess or
her successors put on his trail: first to
track the child to the murderer’s shack,
then to track the murderer to the creek
and then, in a final, remarkable burst of
intelligence, to swim out and tug at the
floating sack.
Mrs. Maxwell reviews several well-
known Sydney murder cases in which the
Alsatians played an extremely useful part
in tracking the criminal, and she has
many dramatic stories of the rescue of
people—emphasising, incidentally,
that, wonderful as the dogs are at follow-
ing a scent, the sooner they are called in
the better. But it is not so much as a
crime book but as a kind of nature book,
a collection of astonishing facts about
astonishing dogs, that The Cold Nose of
the Law is fascinating.
One suspects that Constable Alec Den-
holm, the man chiefly responsible for the
success of the N. S. Wales experiment,
whose story Mrs. Maxwell weaves skil-
fully into her narrative, is dog-lover first
and policeman second, and certainly no-
body interested in dogs, or in animals
generally, should miss this book. It is all
the more readable in that Mrs. Maxwell
does not sentimentalise the dogs, but
presents the facts about them not only
with admiration but with scientific de-
tachment.
One chapter, a demonstration of the
great difficulty—if not the impossibility —•
of reforming the animal killer (and nine
times out of ten the two-legged killer is
just as incurable) is devoted to Dot the
Dingo, a pet of Constable Denholm’s
which had to be returned to Taronga
Park Zoo. But the Alsatians, if not so
ferocious, are just as interesting; not
merely for Zoe’s 300 tricks, but for such
information as this:
Early in his career Denholm discovered
that the Alsatian possesses an uncanny
ability to discriminate between sounds. All
dogs showed in the plainest fashion pos-
sible that they understood very well whether
direction came from their own trainer or
not, though an identical police whistle may
have been used by both men. Some would
even refuse to accept direction they deemed
unfamiliar. Kaspar of Timi was one so
sensitive of ear that Denholm never dared
to mislay his own whistle when working
the dog. He knew he would have trouble
with Kaspar if he did.
Mrs. Maxwell, who previously wrote
a good book in Wooden Hookers, has
done well with The Cold Nose of the
Law. It is not a work of literature, but
it is clear, capable and direct, without
any of the padding or forced jocularity
that usually mar Australian popular writ-
ing. When one considers that the material
has necessarily been obtained at second-
hand —chiefly from Constable Denholm
—and when one considers the labor of
selection, compression and shaping that
must have been necessary to make the
story flow so smoothly, the book is an
admirable achievement. The job could
hardly have been better done, and the
story of the police dogs was very well
worth telling.
Tough Hombres.
As soon as a tall man with a scar,
black hair, grey eyes, a saddle-colored
face and a pearl-handled forty-five, hotly
but ineffectually pursued by Mexican
police, appears in Francis Gerard’s The
Prisoner of the Pyramid (MacDonald),
the reader knows he is in for something.
And there is a heavy hint of buried
treasure and mysterious doings in the
preceding chapter, some four-and-a-
quarter centuries earlier, when an Aztec
prince—a nephew of Montezuma —after
making a perilous journey with heavily-
burdened porters along this selfsame
track, bloodily exterminates the porters.
Subsequently there is no cause for dis-
appointment. The scarred —but hand-
some —rider, having given a hint of his
bellicose qualities by the careless ease
with which he wears his pearl-handled
forty-five, comes upon a villainous group
of peons, gauchos or plain hombres en-
gaged in murder. He casually greets
them — “Buenos dias, sehores” —and when
they wheel round, registering brutish sur-
prise, swiftly followed by brutish fero-
city, fluidly kills them. Or most of them.
At which their intended victim remarks
“Dios mio ! But you are a man of your
hands, senor.”
As well he might. But the exchange of
courtesies is interrupted by a bandit, im-
perfectly killed, who fires a shot, at which
the scarred stranger drops like a stone.
Or a rabbit. But it is all a ruse. When
the bandit scuttles from cover and kicks
the corpse with a calloused bare toe he
finds himself looking down the unwaver-
ing barrel of the pearl-handled forty-five.
“Where will you have it?” asks the grey-
eyed stranger: —• \
“You will oblige me,” replied the little
Indian simply, “if, of your courtesy, you
will shoot me through the head, senor .”
“So be it,” said the other and obligingly
did' as he was asked.
Thereafter adventure comes thick and
fast. The man with a scar shoots,
strangles, knifes and manhandles an in-
credible number of desperadoes of vari-
ous nationalities, aided and abetted by
the man he has rescued, who is a local
grandee, a descendant of Montezuma s
nephew, and the heir to all the fabulous
Aztec treasure, and by a fat little priest
who is a retired bandit king and deadly
with a shooting-iron. The stranger is
not, as it would at first appear, just a
bad man wanted by the police, but a
British Secret Service agent with a lovely
and aristocratic wife waiting for him in
London, and his principal foe is Prince
Von Wallenfels, a German espionage
chief who fell out with Hitler and who is
planning to bring the world to its knees
by bacteriological warfare. These wicked
plans are foiled in a final grand splurge or
blood-letting, all of which is innocent and
ferocious enough to suit the most jaded
adolescent appetite.

Are there any obstacles to amend-
ing the Commonwealth Constitution
so that “any legislation to nationalise
any part of the economic life of the
Commonwealth shall be invalid unless
approved by the electors by way of
a referendum’’ ?
All alterations in the Constitution
must be made by the referendum
route, after an enabling Bill has been
passed by an absolute majority of
each House. Such a Bill passed, it
would be perfectly competent for the
electors to prescribe, by majorities in
four States and in the Commonwealth,
that “any legislation to nationalise”
shall be “invalid unless approved.”

OCEAN, APRIL 14, 1912.
Out cleaved the huge
Liner to appalling doom.
From the crow’s nest
Through the murky gloom.
Rang out the warning—
Big iceberg ahead.
Too late to stay the
Grim toll of the dead.
The liner was skuddled.
Her reign was o’er.
On the North Atlantic,
Far out from the shore, t
Bravery and terror among
The voyagers and crew.
In the midst of the roar
Panic did grimly ensue.
The calamity was o’er.
With a moaning sound,
The waves rolled over
The ill-fated drowned.


LEMIN SQUEEZERS
BY J. B. BLAIR
MRS. NOYSE took down a string-
bag from a hook behind the
kitchen-door and put it on the
i table. It was a simple enough
move, yet it galvanised to instant action
two-year-old Richard, who was sitting on
the floor by the gas-stove, playing with
an egg-beater and a couple of potatoes.
He scrambled to his feet, trod on one
of the potatoes, sat down with a bump,
gave an indignant yell and was up again,
made a vengeful swipe at the potato with
the egg-beater and tottered unsteadily but
purposefully out of the . room.
Mrs. Noyse crossed to the window and
called “To-ny!” whereupon a small patch
of earth-colored matter slightly lighter
than the surrounding loam detached itself
from the freshly-dug bed that was
destined to be Mr. Noyse’s bean-plot and
moved towards the house. Mrs. Noyse
met it at the backdoor just in time to
save her carpets from what would have
been their fifth trampling of mud for the
day.
< ‘'"TONY, you filthy little wretch. Don’t
A bring that mud into the house.
Wipe your shoes. No, take them off.”
“It’s only garden mud, mummy,” said
Tony in self-justification. “It’s not dirty
mud.”
“Those clothes were clean on this
morning,” said his mother, almost in
tears.
There was only one thing for it. With
a deftness born of practice she peeled the
muddy clothes off the five-year-old,
“Now, into the bathroom, quick!” she
ordered, giving him a sharp slap on the
bare rump to encourage action.
As she followed him into the bathroom
she passed Richard in the passage. Fol-
lowing the chain of associated ideas set
in action by the sight of the string-bag,
he had wheeled his stroller out of its
usual stabling-place in the lobby, and was
seated in it, patiently awaiting his mother's
departure for the shopping centre.
His position was strategically chosen
to command a clear view of front- and
back-doors, so that there would be no
fear of his mother’s getting away without
his knowledge. He still held the egg-
beater, and Mrs. Noyse paused a moment
to relieve him of it. This instantly raised
Richard to a high pitch of fury. He
clutched the sides of the stroller, and
bounced himself up and down, at the
same time emitting yells of an intensity
that would scarcely have been justified
had he been sitting in a bed of hot
coals.
| NURED to such outbursts, his mother
1 turned away and followed Tony into the
bathroom. Richard’s yelling ceased as
suddenly as it had begun. Deciding that
a howl unheeded was a howl wasted, he
tried other means of expressing his dis-
pleasure. He took off his shoes and flung
them violently through the door into the
lounge. For some weeks this had been
his favorite reaction when thwarted in
his desires. It gave him twofold satisfac-
tion. It relieved his feelings and also
meant that Mrs. Noyse, the author of his
discontent, would have to pick the shoes
up and put them on again for him.
Mrs. Noyse heard the two thuds of the
hurtling shoes, and marked their signi-
ficance, but for the moment she was fully
occupied with the task of disengaging
Tony from his covering of garden soil.
Amateur photographers who do their
own developing and printing know the
feeling that is experienced when, under
the influence of the developing fluid, the
murk of the film is dispelled and the
picture comes into being before their
eyes ; even after years of experience some
feeling of wonderment is still evoked
by the phenomenon. A somewhat similar
feeling comes to those whose lot it is to
wash the mud and grime off the face of
a small boy.
Mrs. Noyse had had more than her
share of that thankless task, but accus-
tomed as she was to it she never ceased
to marvel at the seeming miracle that
could be wrought with soap and water.
On this occasion, however, she did not
pause long to reflect upon it, and as soon
as the face of her second son emerged in
something approaching its pristine
splendor, she thrust a bath flannel into
his hand and said “Here, finish yourself
off. Wash your hands.”
“What! Both of them?” asked Tony,
hoping apparently to save one of his fists
from the ordeal by water,
“Yes, both of them,” replied his mother
as she left the bathroom and went in
search of Richard’s shoes.
The first one was easy. It lay on the
lounge-floor at the foot of a small occa-
sional-table. Alongside it lay a vase of
Venetian glass it had carried with it in the
final stage of its flight. Mrs. Noyse’s
heart sank as she picked up the vase and
examined it. By a miracle it was still in-
tact. She replaced it and looked around
for the other shoe. This was not such a
simple matter; it was nowhere to be
seen in the lounge.
From his vantage-point outside the
door Richard watched proceedings com-
placently. The search was none of his
business. His role was that of thrower-
away of shoes; the task of retrieving
them he left to others. Sooner or later
the shoes would be recovered and re-
placed on his feet ready for further dis-
carding when desired. Until then he
was content to watch and wait.
Mrs. Noyse shifted chairs and peeped
behind furniture and at last found the
shoe behind the radio. She whisked
Richard into the bathroom for a quick
clean-up, to find Tony playing boats with
a match-box. At her approach he pulled
out the plug and climbed guiltily out of
the bath, leaving the contents of the
match-box bobbing up and down in the
troubled waters like logs floating down-
stream from a logging-camp,
“You naughty boy,” scolded his
mother. “You’ve ruined those matches.”
“No, I haven’t wuined them, Mummie,’
protested Tony. “They won’t go down
the plug-hole. You see.”
His mother wasted no time in explana-
tion, but gave Richard his wash, dried
both boys and hustled them into their
bedroom for dressing.
TEN minutes later the Noyse family
shopping expedition set forth, Richard
lolling back in the stroller with all the
dignity of an Eastern potentate, Mrs.
Noyse pushing and Tony hanging on to
the side, ostensibly to help his mother
push but actually stealing some of her
motive-power to pull him up the hill.
When they reached the top of the street
and turned the comer they encountered
Patricia, on her way home from school.
“Oh, Mummie, can I come up to the
shops?” she greeted Mrs. Noyse.
“No, just go on home, dear. We won’t
be long. Play out in the back for a
while. You can pick some lemons. I
promised Mrs, Anderson some. Pick a
couple of dozen.”
Patricia went dutifully home and the
party moved on, to be held up again a
couple of hundred yards further on by
David, also homeward bound from
school. He made the same request as his
sister and got the same reply.
“Uh-huh!” said David, using the latest
addition to his stock of
idioms. “Can we use the
step-ladder?”
“Yes, if you want to.”
“Uh-huh! ” And he skipped off.
Mrs. Noyse made to move off. Tony
hung back.
“I want to go and pick lemons,” he
moaned.
Now that the two elder children were
home Mrs. Noyse was not averse to hav-
ing her Number Two son off her hands
for a short space,
“All right,” she said. “Run along.
Hurry, and you’ll catch up to David.”
With only Richard to worry about she set
off briskly on her way.
AN hour later, her shopping completed,
Mrs. Noyse turned for home again.
When she reached the top of her street
she found David waiting for her. Some-
thing in his manner prompted her to
ask: “What’s wrong?”
“Well, nothing’s really wrong ...”
replied the eight-year-old.
“I can see something’s happened,” said
Mrs. Noyse. “What is it?”
“Well, you know you told us to pick
some lemons?”
“Yes.”
“And you said we could use the step-
ladder?”
” “Did Tony fall off it?” interrupted his
mother. “Is he hurt?”
“No, Tony’s not hurt, Mummie. And
he didn’t fall off the ladder.”
“Was it Patricia, then?”
“No, she didn’t fall off the ladder,
either. But it’s her it happened to,
though,”
“What happened?”
“What I'm trying to tell you about.”
“Well, for goodness’, sake tell me about
it and stop talking about the step-ladder.”
“Well, we got the step-ladder and I
climbed up it first. No, that’s wrong.
Tony climbed up it first, ’cos he went up
the steps and I climbed up the back of
it.”
“Where does Patricia come in?”
“She was holding the basket.* 1
“And what happened to her?”
“I’m coming to that. You see, when
we got to the top of the ladder I said to
Tony ‘You stand there and pick some
lemons and I’ll get into the tree and pick
some.’ Well, we picked some lemons
and passed them down to Patricia, and
after a while I said, ‘How many’s that?’
and Patricia said ‘Twenty-four,’ so I said,
‘Well, that’s all we want,’ and Patricia
said, ‘No, Mummie told me three dozen’
and I said ‘No, she said two dozen.’ You
did, too, didn’t you, Mummie?”
“Yes, two dozen was right, dear. But
what about Patricia? What happened to
her?”
David’s love of long, involved explana-
tions of simple incidents was exasperating
at times, but it was part of his make-up
and had to be accepted.
1( J ’M coming to that,” he insisted, and
* went on with his story.
“Well, I said two dozen and Patricia
said three dozen and while we were argu-
ing Tony picked three more, and that
put him ahead of me ’cos we’d been see-
ing who could pick the most, so I picked
some more and he picked some more and
then Patricia said ‘That’s three dozen,
that’s enough,’ so we came down.”
“And what happened then?”
“Well, we counted the lemons, and
there were 37, so I said, ‘That makes three
dozen and one.’ That’s right, isn’t it?”
“Yes.”
“So I saw a little squibbly one in the
basket, so I said, ‘This one isn’t worjh
counting. It’s too squibbly.’ And that
was one of the ones Tony picked, so he
said, ‘lt is not squibbly,’ and I said ‘lt is
so squibbly. I’ll show you how squibbly
it is. I can put it in my mouth, all at
once.’ And I did.”
“But what happened to Patricia ?”
“I’m trying to tell you, Mummie. You
see, when I put the squibbly lemon in
my mouth, Tony said, ‘That doesn’t show
it’s squibbly,’ and he picked up another
lemon and put it in his mouth. Then
I said ‘Pooh, I can put a bigger one than
that in my mouth’; and I took a really
big lemon and popped it in. I took the
squibbly one out first, of course.”
Although Mrs. Noyse could not see any
signs of the narrative getting any closer
to whatever catastrophe had befallen
Patricia she refrained from further ques-
tioning. They had now reached the gate
of the Noyse domicile, and it would be
only a minute or so before she would
know the worst.
“Hold the gate for me, David,” she
said, manoeuvring Richard’s chariot into
position for the entry.
“Don’t go in yet, Mummie,” pleaded
David. “Wait till I finish telling you
about Patricia.”
“But you haven’t told me anything
about Patricia yet. All I’ve heard is
about your lemon-bobbing competition.”
“Lemon-bobbing?” repeated David.
“Is that what it’s called? I’ll tell Tony
that.”
“Hold the gate, please, dear.”
“Not yet, Mummie. Wait till I’ve
finished.”
“You can finish on the way in.”
“But Tony’ll tell you first.”

Various Verse
“From On High.”
Absolved from laws of time and space
I know no hour, I know no place,
Easy and swift, like light through glass,
Through the gross flesh of men I pass,
And as I pass I leave behind
No faintest trace upon the mind.
No more than the far-flashing ray
Marks the clear crystal on its way;
Right through the carolling bird I flow.
His urges to the worms I know.
His choice of mate, so coy and prim,
Is clear to me but dark to him.

The Storm.
The tree is rooted deep. It stands stock-still
And lets the storm brew witchcraft on the hill:
The granite air is golden. And now see,
O catch the breath at the small fierce dragonfly
Among the lightning—taller than standing tree,
Butting the toppling stonework of cleft sky,
An aircraft sparks across immensity.
And the pilot, swallowed, yawns. You may be.
sure
His is the smile adjusted at the door
Where heart raps the summons. Did Jonah in
the whale
Call up his pride and set astride his feet.
Still doubt’s still voices, plotting the route he’d
sail ?
He feels the rudder quiver, sits to meet
The panel 1 s doubtful screening of the gale.
And he is in the bonfire. Set a candle there
And cup it from the melting lips of air.
The kiss and rape of forces. O pilot sit well.
Flirting has set you in the witch’s side
And you must act physician, save that still
White moth-flame from immensity of shade
Where proves the witless tree upon the hill.

Eagle.
I was the wind you heard, the bolt of light;
But nothing more —eagle in flight.
You never felt my talons; though the lamb,
My prey in inextricably tight jamb,
Once stirred your pity, as you watched its end;
But this, not of your flock. “Majestic friend,
Most noble eagle,” you ascribed me yours:
Symbol for coat-of-arms, like-strength procures.
You thought it honorable to be my patron;
I, always, to be yours, upon a saffron
Field, eagle displayed, with a mean tongue of
flame:
As I, to prey upon defenceless game.
Coward, imprint my charge upon your shield.
Soar, as I over paddocks, your own field
And feel, you, how the gizzard’s strings must
strain
To wrest an hungered’s meal out of the plain.

JOHN BLIGHT.
The Lions Roar at the Stars.
The lions roar at the stars.
The cocks crow at the moon.
Across the bay the dogs bark
and it will be day soon.
God (/ think) is in the trees
that move to the winds of dawn,
and God lurks in the grass
ihat makes my bright lawn.
But I live in the dark,
watching the stars and moon,
hearing the cocks and lions,
knowing day will come soon.
There I live, and know
night cannot last always:
There will come an hour of song
to eke and end my days.

Kenneth Mackenzie.
For the Darling Downs.
Your subtle veins of soft creeks lisp and beat
Under the exile’s dream, and your ripe wheat.
Golden like a fable, quivers in blades
Of light in the white appraisal of the clouds.
Undisciplined as anger, you loose your passion
Of green to mock the cdnfined song I fashion,
Then slip with submissive languor into the strong
Deciduous arms of men who have loved you
long,
I
Gravely and deeply and cursed you with hate
as intense;
But, lovely woman of season-moods, lithe sense
Of wonder bewitched in mantle silence, you
yield
No secret save the wind-rustle speech of the
field.
Your days, the stormed and quiet, pass with
your river
Into affinities of blood forever.
Where shadows, suns, and flesh of the vague
dead blend
In impertinent growth that has no bound nor
end:
Drought cannot crush it, nor flood destroy; it
keeps
Its continuity while labor sleeps,
Thrusting towards tomorrow, its root in the hand
Of the first lost predecessor, tapping the land.
Som'e outmoded god of a legend that is still
Cast a sneer on the face of your sculptured hill
As if your grace were sinister, your sky
Of harvest-summer deceptive as a lie;
But I have seen, when earth is warm and birds
Fling fragile discord over spring, that sneer
Sun-moulded into smile, suddenly.
And memorised its strange blue splendor there.
O territory of dreams, O love that is old,
Ploughman and poet share your heart of gold
In winsome flashes only. With hopes and fears
Both draw shallow furrows down the years.
QUEENSLAND.

N.S.W.
Our rooster shakes his lovely head
Stalking among the orange trees
And after him, complacent wives
Walk delicately, as if on knives,
Plumed gloriously in brown and red.
He pauses, but the sound of bees
Is all he hears —or does he hear
Far echoes from a sanded pit
And have more pride because of it?
And can he feel brown Javanese
Hands at his shoulders, on his wings
Until the moment of release?
Scratching on grass and clover burrs,
Straight from his legs his untried spurs
Show he was bred for fiercer things
Than fossicking for scattered seeds
Or beckoning obedient hens.
If joy goes singing through his head
It is because his eyes are red;
Red eyes and feathers, and red deeds
Compound his heritage. His srace
Sprang from his fathers’ gaming blood.
So, in the first light when he crows.
He is a warrior bird and knows
A different time, another place.

Another “Caterpillar" Diesel Tractor unit with cable
controlled dozer filling in swamp . It is estimated that these
“Caterpillar” units will handle 750,000 cubic yards to
fill in this area.
WENTY-FOUR "Caterpillar” Diesel Tractors are speeding the construction
of the £5,000,000 Kingsford Smith Airport at Mascot, New South Wales,
shifting 9,000,000 yards of material at the rate of 25,000 to 30,000 tons per week.
Kingsford Smith Airport will be the largest in the Southern Hemisphere, covering
an area of approximately 2,000 acres, with runways up to 10,000 feet long and 300
feet wide to accommodate the world’s largest air liners.
The diversion of the Cook’s River into Botany Bay, one mile south of its present
outlet, by cutting a channel 600 feet wide by 24 feet deep and miles long,
calls for the moving of 2,500,000 yards of earth. The balance of the 9,000,000
yards of material to be moved will be made up in raising the ’drome level by 9 feet
and filling in the existing river. No less than 6,000,000 yards will come from
the dredging of Botany Bay and 500,000 yards from the nearby sand dunes. The
bulk of this work will be done by "Caterpillar” Diesel D 6, D 7, and D 8 Track-
Type Tractors with cable-controlled Dozers, and No. 12 Diesel Motor Graders.
Operating in loose sand and on swampy ground under the most gruelling
conditions, the "Caterpillar” Diesel Tractors, with their rugged construction,
tremendous power and easy mobility, give the maximum of sustained traction
power, with the minimum of fuel consumption that makes "Caterpillar a byword
for economy. Fitted with all-weather seals and filters that shut out the abrasive sand
and protect vital parts, replacements are reduced to the barest minimum.
To maintain the rate of excavation and increase output as the urgency of the job
demands, "Caterpillar” Diesel Traction and Earth-Moving Equipment help speed
still one more national project to a successful conclusion, economically and on time!

U.S. PRESIDENTIAL WAR
Warfare (of the platform
variety) is anything but “cold”
now on the U.S. Presidential
front. Over the next month or
two, with the choice of candi-
date-teams going on and so
many eminent Republicans lured
in by what is reckoned the strong
prospect of ousting Mr. Truman,
the field will be strewn with
casualties.
It would be a rash prophet
who would try to name the next
President now. Reports from
the front, as in any other war,
are very liable to be loaded.
Anyone reading only the Hearst
and McCormick press, for in-
stance, would have thought
General MacArthur had only
to throw his hat over the para-
pet to get the Republican nomi-
nation and hence the Presi-
dency. Turn to, say, the
“Christian Science Monitor’s”
well-informed Washington cor-
respondent Roscoe Drummond,
and the General becomes, in-
stead, merely “the darkest of
dark horses.” His bid in the
Wisconsin primary would
“hardly influence at all the ulti-
mate nomination.” The Repub-
lican party “wouldn’t have taken
even Gen. Dwight D. Eisen-
hower unless it felt he was neces-
sary to winning. It doesn’t feel
that General MacArthur is
necessary to winning or that he
would be the best vote-getter.”
So the reports run on all
aspects of the fight, with violent
fluctuations from week to week.
One fairly unanimous view at
the present time is that Mr,
Truman will be extremely lucky
to be re-elected. A timely
Soviet-made crisis is named as
one thing most likely to help
him. The Wallace “third-party”
bid, itself of course fore-
doomed, is regarded as one of
the President’s major threats;
likely to do enough damage to
him to make any Republican
candidate a certainty.
President Truman’s personal
position is a striking example of
the fluctuations of the fight.
Through last year his prestige,
which had been down to bed-
rock, steadily rose. It was at
its peak in December. Since
then it has sharply declined
(according, that is, to reports,
which are always, in this war-
fare, very open to doubt). It
was at such an ebb last month
that “U.S. News-World Report”
was flatly stating:
“Mr. Truman will be leaving
the White House in less than a
year. The Truman tenure,
barring a miracle, is to end on
January 20, 1949. A Republi-
can President will enter the
White House after a 16-year
absence,”
The main reason given for
that confident crystal-gazing was
“a cracking-up within the Demo-
cratic party.” Mr. Truman, as
thus viewed, had failed in re-
conciling conflicting elements
within the party: “The Roose-
velt political success rested upon
an ability to hold together Left-
wing groups in the big cities,
Right-wing leaders in the South,”
Mr. Truman is reported to have
offended the South with his
moves favoring negroes. There
was a similar revolt against
Roosevelt, but the South then
came round. It is not thought
likely to do so for Mr. Truman.
The fact that Mr. Truman
had (last month) to declare him-
self a candidate for the Demo-
cratic nomination was widely
regarded as a sign of political
weakness. A typical comment
was: “The fact that a first-term
President has to go to his party
to offer his services rather than
wait for his party to come to
.him to demand his services is
not a sign of strength.” The
“Christian Science Monitor”
Washington correspondent has
commented: “The Truman
— N. Y. "Daily Mirror."
NOAH KNOWS.
Administration today is being
harried from its own Left and
from its own Right, and it is
only an objective report to add
that its natural supporters are
far from enthusiastic; they are
just resigned.”
In a further comment on the
reported gloom in the Demo-
cratic camp the same correspon-
dent (who at least writes with
an air of impartiality! has
stated: “Mr. Truman isn’t go-
ing to retire voluntarily. He
made that clear this week. And
to ditch the President at this
stage would be to repudiate the
party’s record for the past three
years, and that would make cer-
tain a defeat which is now prob-
able.”
The Democratic gloom is also
commented on by N. Y.
“Times”: “In Democratic circles
there is talk of dropping Mr.
Truman at the convention next
July—a move that w.ould have
historical precedent. Out of the
six Vice-Presidents (before Mr.
Truman) who succeeded to the
Presidency, only two (Theodore
Roosevelt and Calvin Coolidge)
won their party’s nomination
for another term. Most obser-
vers predict, however, that Mr,
Truman will be the Demo-
cratic candidate. As one put
it, ‘Who else have we got?’ ”
On general report the Demo-
cratic party seems lacking in
such outstanding figures asi Van-
denberg and Taft, and David
Lawrence has stated in N. Y.
“Sun” that if war should break
out President Truman might
make a gesture of political self-
sacrifice and urge the Demo-
cratic National Convention to
nominate Secretary of State
Marshall by acclamation for the
Presidency. “While Marshall
has stated in positive terms that
he could not be drafted for high
office, there is the same feeling
about him as persists about
General Eisenhower. Somehow
there is a difference between a
draft imposed in peace-time and
one that might be imposed in
time of war, when the President
actively becomes the Corn-
mander-in-Chief, The President
admires George Marshall as an
outstanding soldier and leader,
If Mr, Truman were to with-
draw at the last moment it would
certainly be only under such
dramatic circumstances as would
enable the American people to
benefit by the selection of a
non-political figure of established
prestige.” '
Various large and airy
motives are credited to Mr.
Wallace in his “third-party” bid,
but the fact that this could
damage no one but his former
Presidential boss, who was under
the painful necessity of sacking
him, would at least suggest a
strong enough purely personal
urge. As seen by the “Christian
Science Monitor” man, its effect
is: “The defection of the Left
under the ulterior leadership of
the Communists, using non-
Communist Henry Wallace as
their front, will draw seriously
from the President in the north-
ern industrial States,”
“Henry Wallace,” N, Y.
“Herald Tribune” comments,
“presumably was familiar with
past attempts to win the Presi-
dency by forming third parties
before he launched his own
attempt. The record is not en-
couraging. The most recent
effort was that of WilMam Lemke
in 1936, with his Union party.
It failed to win a single elec-
toral vote. In 1924 Robert M.
LaFollette and his Progressive
party won only the 13 electoral
votes of Wisconsin.” And,
perhaps ominously for Mr. Tru-
man: “In three earlier attempts,
the new third parties succeeded
in throwing the Presidency to
the established party which
otherwise probably would not
have won it. Theodore Roose-
velt’s bolt in 1912 sent Wood-
row Wilson to the White House.
Another Democrat, Grover.
Cleveland, Fas elected because
of the split in 1884. And in
1844 James J, Polk, Democrat,
beat out Henry Clay, Whig, be-
cause of the anti-slavery Liberty
party.”
The eventual Republican
nomination is very much any-
body’s guess at present. A
dozen different sources provide
about as many choices, every
one of them tinctured with wish-
ful thinking. Even “U.S. News-
World Report’s” decidedly con-
fident “Senator Arthur Vanden-
berg is in No. 1 position among
Republicans just now” could
turn out no better than any of
the equally confident tips for
Taft, Dewey, Stassen, Warren or
MacArthur. The same publi-
cation, taking a glance at the
wider battlefield of world affairs,
prognosticates that with a Re-
publican replacing Mr, Truman
as President “war will be no
more likely, may be less likely
than it is.” But that could be
just wishful thinking, too. It
assumes that the balance of war
or peace is the personal pro-
perty of the American President,
a proposition which seems a little
open to dbubt.
The obsession of Americans
in this, to them, all-important
issue and its effect in the wider
international field have been
summed up by an English visi-
tor in an interview with New
York reporters: “The gentlemen
in the Kremlin take the view
that your policy in international
affairs is semi-paralysed until
the November election. They are
gathering rosebuds while they
may,”
Abandoned Partition.
It would be hard to think up
anything less convincing or so
contrary to the plainest evidence
than the much-publicised ex-
planation of the Palestine-parti-
tion failure made by Dr. Evatt:
“In my opinion, the U.N.O. de-
cision has been gradually under-
mined by intrigues directed
against the Jewish people.”
What has been “directed
against the Jewish people” has
been completely open and above
board; moreover, it was told to
Dr, Evatt and his fellow-U.N.O.
Solomons before they did their
beautiful bit of botchery. It is)
the open and active opposition
of the Arabs,
But that, the U.N.O. Solo-
mons were assured and ap-
parently preferred to believe,
was merely Arab bluff. So
against it, and against the warn-
ings of much-experienced and
sorely-tried Britain —a platoon
of whose Foreign Office experts
could lose the whole U.N.O.
collection —the U.N.O. Assembly
put through the partition scheme
which the Arab opposition has
forced the U.S. to abandon.
That U.S. decision was not
easily taken. It could be politi-
cally fatal to the present Presi-
dent, as nobody would know
better than Mr. Truman him-
self.
N. Y. “Times,” a fortnight or
so after Dr. Evatt produced his
“explanation,” gave the simple
facts of the Arab-enforced
switch: “Cabinet members in
the Truman Administration
issued warnings—in public and
in the privacy of the White
House —that it would be danger-
ous to carry out the decision in
the face of Arab opposition.”
Other practical considerations
were involved—“ln these warn-
ings two words were repeated
with drumming insistency ; they
were oil and Russia” —but they
came down to the same thing.
Neither the question of oil nor
of Russia would have entered
into it but for the hard, plain
fact that when the Arabs re-
peatedly said they would oppose
partition to the last they meant
every word of it.
Explanations like that of Dr.
Evatt are merely a clouding of
that plain issue. But the U.N.O.
Solomons are badly in need of
such clouding for this, their very
worst blunder. They were
themselves in the clouds when
they made it.
Air-age Survival.
Last July President Truman
appointed an Air Policy Com-
mission, requesting it to make
the scope of its inquiries so
broad that its recommendations
“could serve as a guide for
formulating a carefully - con-
sidered national air policy.” En-
titled “Survival in the Air Age,”
the commission’s report is as
arresting as its title.
Predicating that “World peace
and the security of the United
States are now the same thing,”
the report gives U.N.O. its right-
ful meed of politeness; but
“even the most optimistic view
of the record of the United
Nations does not assure us that
the United Nations will develop
in time the necessary authority
to prevent another great war” —
a masterly example of under-
statement.
The report proceeds: “Not
being able to count on absolute
security under law, the United
States must seek the next best
thing—positive security under
the protection of its own arms.”
The commission members insist
that what is now required is a
new strategic concept of defence
based on air power.
For strategic purposes, they
divide the future into two parts
—Phase I, “during which we
may assume that we have a
monopoly on atomic weapons,”
and Pha§e 11, “the time when
other nations will have atomic

forf
weapons in quantity and the
equipment to deliver them in a
sustained attack on the United
States mainland.”
The commission members
assume that “bther nations are
not now producing atomic wea-
pons in quantity,” but “it would
be an unreasonable risk for our
present planning purposes to
assume that other nations will
not have atomic weapons in
quantity by the end of 1952.”
Pointing as well to the dangers
of “biological war,” they em-
phasise that particular year in a
further passage;
It is probable that other nations
will develop atomic weapons before
they develop supersonic bombers in
quantity with a striking range of 5000
miles, or supersonic accurate guided
missiles with a 5000-mile range.
Nevertheless, it would be unwise to
assume, in the planning of our de-
fence establishment, that other nations
will not have the planes and missiles
capable of delivering a sustained
attack on the United States mainland
by the end of 1952.
While believing that a major
war is unlikely in the first
period, the commission members
argue that there must be in-
creased preparedness, in case,
with an even stronger force
ready for the second period, an
attack during which —apparently
considered probable by the mem-
bers and their military advisers
—“would be extremely violent.”
Despite any former isolation-
ism, it has always been U.S.
higher policy to fight its wars as
far from home as possible—the
reverse of the policy so strenu-
ously urged by Messrs. Curtin,
Ward, Beasley and other Labor
stalwarts in 1939, when they op-
posed Australia taking any part
in war (other than the heroic
part of perhaps supplying
Britain with some food) outside
this country’s actual map boun-
daries; no troops to be sent
even as far afield as New
Guinea. (The record in Hansard
of that 1939 stand makes
almost incredible reading.) The
U.S. report here considered
takes a wide step from that sort
of thing:
What we must have and can sup-
port in Phase II is a reasonably strong
defensive establishment to minimise
the enemy’s blow, but above all a
counter-offensive air establishment in
being which will be so powerful that
if an enemy does attack we shall be
able to retaliate with the utmost
violence and to seize and hold the ad-
vanced positions from which we can
divert the destruction from our home-
land to his.
Holding the existing U.S. Air
Force to be inadequate even for
the first, probably undisturbed,
period, “and hopelessly wanting
in respect of the future Phase II
period, when a serious danger
of atomic attack will exist,” the
commission members recom-
mend what would certainly be
a formidable strength for Russia
or anyone else to have a crack
at:
A minimum regular establishment
of 70 groups with 6869 first-line air-
craft, an Air National Guard of 27
groups with 3212 first-line aircraft and
an adequately equipped 34-group Air
Reserve. The level of procurement of
new aircraft must be high enough to
keep this force modern at all times.
An adequate reserve, now estimated
by the Air Force at 8100 aircraft,
must be created and kept in a proper
state of modernisation.
That programme—in addition
to which Navy Air Force in-
creases and other like measures
are recommended —would alone
mean raising the Air Force
budget from its present level of
$2,850,000,000 to $4,150,000,000
for the present calendar year
and $5,450,000,000 for the
calendar year 1949. Mentioning
again the particular year which
they apparently have some
special reason for thus empha-
sising, the commission members
declare: “We must start now on
this programme and complete it
before the end of 1952.”
Italian Elections.
Looking to this week’s Italian
elections (April 18), former
U.S, Under Secretary of State
Sumner Welles forecast that on
that day “the Communists will
provoke local riots in order to
prevent their opponents, and
particularly the Italian women,
from going to the polls.”
To counter that, a strong or-
ganisation has recently been
built up, very much on the Com-
munists’ own lines, aiming to
make the voting a record, the
view being that the bigger the
vote the more conclusive the
Communist defeat will be.
If, Welles expects, the Com-
munist leaders see that there is
“a democratic sweep which
neither corruption nor fraud,
nor subversive activities, can
arrest, they will immediately
claim that Communism has been
cheated,” and “that will be the
moment for revolution, pro-
vided Moscow believes the time
to be then ripe for violence.”
In Welles’s view, however,
“the tide against Communism
is today so strong that, unless
the Soviet Government is pre-
pared to support an armed re-
bellion by force, a coup d’etat
—“Literaturnaya Gazetct” (Moscow).
DWARFS’ CHORUS: “ITS OFF TO SAM WE GO!”
would undoubtedly fail. Even
were the Communist leaders to
follow the example set on
Greece’s borders, and establish
a rebel ‘Government’ in some
frontier city like Gorizia, such
a ‘Government’ could nof main-
tain itself save with Russian and
Yugoslav military assistance.
The Italian people, in their great
majority, will resist any attempt
to impose a Communist dic-
tatorship upon them.”
Strategic Turkey.
Turkey has been out of the
limelight for some time, but it
remains one of the key points
in the moves to block further
Soviet expansion.
In the event of war, Scripps-
Howard foreign editor William
Philip Simms points out, “Tur-
key could become the most vital
of all the bases of operation
against Russia in Europe,” being
closer to Moscow and other im-
portant spots than are the posi-
tions in Germany and Austria:
“Turkey is within 200 miles, as
a bomber flies, of Russia’s
richest oil-fields'around Grozny,
She is not more than 300 miles
from the Baku petroleum de-
posits ; and the Ukraine and the
Volga Valley are just across the
Black Sea.
“Russia’s every move since
Yalta has aimed, at making home
territory as secure as possible
against attack, especially by air,
Turkey and Norway are now
the sole remaining free nations
touching the Soviet Union pro-
per. That is why both are now
in such danger. Radar posted in
Norway, Finland, Eastern
Europe, the Balkans and Turkey
would spot enemy planes hours
before they reached the Soviet
border.
“Another reason'for Turkey’s
peril is the increasing tension in
Palestine and the Middle East.
Russia and her Communists
might take over all Western
Europe, including Italy and
France, but unless Russia takes
Turkey, too, she would remain
vulnerable to the same sort of
manoeuvre the Allies used
against the Axis in North Africa.
American and Allied forces
could enter Turkey from the
direction of the Persian Gulf.”
The U.S. sent vast quantities
of lend-lease materials into
Russia by that route. Oil is as
important to Russia as to any
others in that quarter, and it is
held by some authorities that
Russia could not risk war until
it gets its hands on more. But,
while Turkey remains indepen-
dent, the oil-holding Arab coun-
tries will not be so easily co-
erced by Russia: “As long as
Turkey retains her independence,
Russia would not dare wage
aggressive war in the Middle
East. In one way or another,
she would have to have Turkey
on her side.”
There is no chance whatever
of that happening unless Russia
fought and defeated Turkey,
which would have been no push-
over at any time, and Turkey is
every day being made stronger
by American military aid.
Soviet Navy.
“Soviet Submarines Off the
U.S. Coast” figured prominently,
if briefly, in the recent war
scare, and the U.S, Secretary
of the Navy, with the good old
fighting name of John L. Sul-
livan, came out with an estimate
of Soviet submarine strength,
putting the number at 250,
The N. Y. “Times” military
correspondent Hanson W. Bald-
win recalls that pre-war esti-
mates of Russian submarine
strength made by the U.S. Office
of Naval Intelligence “were
proved during the war to be
much too high.” Adding that
“This ‘playing-it-safe’ is still a
naval propensity,” Baldwin de-
clares that “Today the Soviet
Navy, small, obsolete and un-
balanced, is the weakest of the
Soviet armed forces.” He puts
Soviet subs, at from 150 to 175,
and that “is the major element
of Soviet naval strength.”
Of aircraft-carriers., “the
backbone of the modem fleet,”
he reports that “the Soviet has
none.” Though it is considered
unlikely, one, with a capacity of
60 planes, may have been
launched, “but Soviet shipbuild-
ing is slo\y, and probably such
a ship would not be completed
for several years.”
The Russians did acquire the
damaged and unfinished Ger-
man carrier Graf Zeppelin, but
it “was valuable chiefly as
scrap.”
Atom Control.
In U.N.O. —useful for such
purposes, if for little else —Soviet
representatives have hitherto
been able to harp so loudly on
the theme of all the others be-
ing the blockers of atom-control
agreements that some have no
doubt been taken in by the sheer
persistency of the accusing.
Belatedly seeing that danger,
and tired of exposing the falsity
of the Soviet charges, the others
have at last told the Russians
they must either co-operate or
shut up; that the atom would
be wiped as a subject in the
U.N.O. debating academy.
The actual facts of the atom-
control business are simple
enough, and unanswerable:
(1) Of the 15 nations which have
been represented thus far on the
United Nations Atomic Energy
Commission, only Soviet Russia
and Poland oppose an Ameri-
can control plan which all 13
other nations have accepted.
(2) The Soviet alternative to the
American proposal provides
neither for international opera-
tion of atomic plants (which is
the cornerstone of the Acheson-
Lilienthal report) or for aboli-
tion of the veto insofar as con-
trol of atomic energy is con-
cerned (which is the cornerstone
of the Baruch plan).
The Soviet “plan” is that
America must destroy its atom-
bomb stocks first and then
accept the Kremlin’s word that
Russia would not make any—a
plan that W. S. Gilbert could
hardly have bettered

U.N.O. Decisions. Chicago
“Tribune” on that Palestine partition:
“A great many people in this country
who ought to know better have
allowed themselves to believe that the
decisions of U.N. are reached by wise
men acting on high principle. The
wisdom of the men concerned in this
matter is measured by the mounting
death toll; their devotion is not to
the high principles of justice but to
their own ambitions. If these men do
justice it is by accident.”

Politics Get Low. —As an example
of what he calls “the low state of
American politics” (no unusual
phenomenon in a Presidential year,
when anything whatever serves for
ammunition), David Lawrence reports
in N. Y. “Sun” that “too many
people are saying that the international
situation is just a ‘manufactured crisis’
designed to help President Truman
get re-elected.” In that Mr. Truman
is “the victim of a propaganda that
has been built up with respect to the
1940 and 1944 Presidential cam-
paigns, when another Democratic
President didn’t hesitate to use his
Commander-in-Chief role to get votes.
Mr. Roosevelt used to get quite a
chuckle out of his so-called inspection
trips to defence installations in vari>
ous parts of the country, where
political demonstrations and street
parades ensued. Mr. Roosevelt had
quite a lot of fun with the reporters
pretending that his stumping trips
were non-political. Unhappily, how-
ever, for Mr. Truman, nowadays a
large section of the public has been
educated to believe that Presidents do
not hesitate to use international affairs
to help them politically.”

over the English. He’d been “attack-
ing them vigorously” in propaganda
blasts: “But the English won’t let
themselves be disturbed in the com-
placency of their arguments. They
are a very peculiar people, with whom
it is difficult to have an argument.
They are obdurate to a degree that
gets on one’s nerves in the long run.
But possibly that is a national ad-
vantage rather than a disadvantage.”

Kin to Communism. —It’s appar-
ently dawning on various onlookers
that Socialism and Communism have
a fair bit in common with the
Colonel’s lady and Judy O’Grady. “It
should have been clear much sooner
than it was,” runs a typical com-
ment in “Wall-street Journal,” “that
this thing called Socialism or Social
Democracy, far from being a weapon
to fight Communism, was a half-way
house to Communism —and a house
with an extremely weak foundation.
Socialism and Communism look to
the same founders. Each proposes
the powerful central State with power
over the minds and the stomachs of
men. Once that process is under way
it can be carried out only by men
who accept all its implications; it
will not be carried out by nice men
who shrink from the dirty work.”

A Good Gamble. —N. Y. “World-
Telegram” supporting the Marshall
Plan: “Estimated military cost of
World War II to the United States
is $330,030,463,084. We were in that
war 1347 fighting days. That’s roughly
$250,000,000 a day. Secretary Mar-
shall’s plan to help the free countries
of Europe remain free, grow strong
and stand by our side to prevent
another war, will cost from 16 to 20
billion dollars. That represents from
60 to 80 days’ cost of a fighting war,
or only one-eighteenth of the military
cost of World War II to the U.S.
It looks like a good gamble.”

Troops for Palestine. —Though
Russia and, of course, the U.S. sup-
ported the now abandoned partition,
no Great Power promised the partition-
makers that its troops would be avail-
able for enforcement. The U.S. was
reported to have sounded out China,
of all places unlikely, for enforce-
ment troops, and was subsequently
reported as sounding out “smaller
Powers.” Canberra’s response to
such an appeal would have shown
the support backing Our Foreign
Policy’s U.N.O. enthusiasms,
* * * *
War-study. General Eisenhower
speaking: “Were as much study and
research devoted to the causes and
prevention of war as have been to
the causes and prevention of disease,
we should in time attain the same
control over its eruption and spread
as we have over the physical plagues.
And were the study of war, its causes
and prevention given the place in our
education curricula that its import-
ance to the individual citizen merits,
we would have better hope of finding
a practical basis for enduring peace.”
To use a Churchillism, it seems sound
doctrine as far as it goes. But the
study would want to be spread out
a bit.

A Prophet Is Right. —Prophets are
so consistently wrong on world affairs
that when one of them happens to
have been at all right he deserves the
credit. In his book In Defence of
Women, published soon after the first
World War, American author H. L.
Mencken wrote: “The present series
of wars, it seems likely, will continue
for 20 or 30 years, and perhaps
longer. That the first clash was in-
conclusive was shown brilliantly by
the preposterous nature of the peace
finally reached —a peace so artificial
and dishonest that the signing of it
was almost equivalent to a new
declaration of war.” And Mencken
forecast, as “contests in the grand
manner... .plainly in sight,” war be-
tween Germany and France and “be-
tween Japan and the United States
for the mastery of the Pacific,” and
also “the effort of Russia to regain
her old unity and power.” That was
back in the early ’twenties; today
most Americans would say Russia is
carrying its part of the forecast a bit
too far.

CANBERRA AND THE COMS.
What the speeches of the Prime Minister
and the Attorney-General, rebutting Mr.
Menzies’ censure motion, amounted to
was this:
That Communism is a philosophy which
any democracy ought to be able to accom-
modate, and therefore the Communists must
continue to be allowed a free run.
That it is impossible to combat them
without setting up a police State and fol-
lowing Hitler’s procedure.
That since the Opposition leaders did not
tell the Chifley Government what to do, it
is clear that there is nothing to be done.
That nothing will be done, anyway, what-
ever the condition of the country, because
the 1917 strike seared Mr. Chifley’s motive
organs.
This was no more than an elaboration
of Mr. Chifley’s method all along of
turning a blind eye to the mischief being
wrought by these wreckers in Aus-
tralian working industry. In his view
the fellows who ordered, and carried
out unhindered by Canberra, a block-
ade of Queensland for nine weeks—“a
dispute,” Mr. Chifley airily called it —
were merely actuated by a sense of
ancient wrongs suffered in the bad old
days, and the same sort of industrial dis-
ruption would, he implied, probably go
on until the evil memory had been erased
by the benefits of the social security which
this Government was going to bring in
with the Golden Age, etcetera, and so
forth.
Not one word about the Labor Rela-
tions Act in the United States which
nipped this sort of industrial sabotage
in the bud. Not a word about the sober-
ing effects in Victoria of the Hollway
Government’s emergency Essential Ser-
vices Act, to the effectiveness of which
tribute has been paid by the president of
the Victorian A.L.P. Not a word about
the possibility of his own Government’s
helping the unions to fight this menace by
insisting on respect for industrial law by
a mob of gangsters who have openly de-
fied it, and whose policy is to defy it, to
the demoralisation of any union efforts
to ensure its orderly operation. Not a
word about the first step in combative
action urged by the Opposition this past
six months, namely, a public investiga-
tion into the Communists’ activities. The
value of such an exposure to all loyal
unionists engaged in rooting out the.
enemy in their midst would be in-
calculable. But even that Mr. Chifley
will not undertake. Let them fight it out
as best they can—like Hanlon.
The truth remains that the Chifley Gov-
ernment was elected on its assurance to
the people that only a “Labor” Govern-
ment could deal with industrial settle-
ment after the war and prevent disastrous
strikes. Actually during its reign there
have been more continuous, injurious and
insolent stoppages than ever before. The
Communists have directed most of these
stoppages to their Moscow-designed
pattern; and in the result Australian
working production—man-hour produc-
tion —has fallen to disgraceful propor-
tions. Dr. Evatt’s new “streamlined”
conciliation system, replacing the Arbitra-
tion Court, belies everything promised for
it: the Communists have not yet allowed
it a fair run. Every strike they have
called has been in impudent defiance of
the conciliation authorities. This also
leaves Mr. Chifley cold.
The whole Government argument
against Mr. Menzies’ motion was, in fact,
grounded in abhorrence of repressive
legislation. This is exactly the Com-
munists’ own war-cry as used in Queens-
land against the Hanlon Government,
against the Hollway Essential Services
Act in Victoria, and even against the
Commonwealth Government’s own
security provisions in the defence-projects
legislation. If the Victorian and Queens-
land Premiers had shown the same supine
indifference to those fomenting what Mr.
Hanlon called incipient civil war, industry
in eastern Australia today would be sub-
ject to rigid Communist dictation. There
are moods when even Mr. Chifley has his
fears. He told the Macquarie A.L.P.
Assembly last month that
If Australia’s industrial production is not
greatly improved we could anticipate
economic disaster.
And economic disaster through the
choking of production is exactly what
the Communists have been plotting, and
are bent upon bringing about.
The Prime Minister’s pretence that this
democracy must tolerate such Communist
sabotage (1) because it is a “philosophy”
that ought not to be repressed and (2)
because he doesn’t know how to stop it
anyway is totally at variance with trade-
union sentiment, now seriously dismayed,
especially in the industrial groups whose
establishment Mr. Chifley once ap-
plauded. Hardly more than a week ago
the annual conference of these groups in
Sydney urged, just as earnestly as the
Opposition in Parliament, that Federal
(and State) “Labor” Governments should
investigate the Communist party’s acti-
vities, and its resolution declared that the
Communist objective is “to overthrow,
by arms if necessary, democratic govern-
ment in Australia.” Its president, Mr.
Junor, said:
If Communists are allowed to get away
with their plans for chaos and disruption
our Governments will fall Our greatest
problem is the soaring cost of living. It
will not be solved by the Healys, Thorntons,
and the Rowes, who pull on strikes without
consulting other unions These arrogant
Communist coxcombs must be put in tlieir
places....
That plumage-changing bird in the in-
dustrial movement, A.R.U. and A.L.P.
boss Ferguson, supporting, declared that
“Communist-party tactics are assisted by
some persons within the political ‘Labor’
movement.”
The Victorian A.L.P. Easter conference
carried a recommendation to its constitu-
ents declaring that
Communists, directed by the Russian
Communist party, are committed to the
destruction of the A.L.P. as a prelude to
social disorder and the seizure of political
power by revolution.
This pronouncement was challenged—as
derogatory to the Communists, who were
“endeavoring to get peace in industry”—
by the representative of the Locomotive
Engineers, the union which Mr. Drake-
ford in the debate last October declared
to have no Communist taint about it.
Queensland’s Premier, Mr. Hanlon,
the only A.L.P, political head game to
stand up to Communist traitors, spoke
last month from the firing-line in his
State, where there was no possibility of
anybody’s believing that Communism was
merely a “political philosophy”:
The Communist policy is purely destruc-
tive and aims at the creation of disorder.
... .All the processes of law for the settle-
ment of this (late) dispute have been tried
by the Government, but interlopers from
the south decreed that the law shall be
violated and that their will shall prevail—
not the will of Parliament, not the will of
the people, not the decisions of a Court
established by law
What do they think we are? Are we
to be pushed around like a lot of slaves?
I have yet to know that Queenslanders have
abandoned their love of freedom and will
bend their knees before the fijst mimicking
Molotov who enters the country
This strike is a challenge to democratically
constituted Government and has all the
elements of a civil war.
And for nine weeks of the Queensland
blockade by the Communists not one
finger did Mr. Chifley lift to check then),
though the Constitution makes it man-
datory that the Commonwealth shall pro-
tect any State from domestic violence.
It is not as though Canberra was, or
is, ignorant of what has been going on
and what is planned. Dr. Ross, director of
public relations in Mr. Chifley’s post-war-
reconstruction department, described it all
in an article in “S. M. Herald” last
October entitled “How the Communists
Play Russia’s Game.” The local “mimick-
ing Molotovs” have themselves been pro-
claiming it with boldness, confident that
under the Chifley regime they have got a
clear run. This is what Thornton said
publicly at the “Soviet Day” procession
in Melbourne in 1946:
We are celebrating the Russian revolution,
but in a couple of years’ time we might be
celebrating Australia’s revolution.
After the defeat of the revolutionary
attempt in Queensland, Lockwood, in the
Sydney Domain, declared that “if
Queensland was a defeat for the Com-
munists I hope we shall suffer many more
such defeats. If we do we shall be
masters of Australia” This line of talk,
used by Healy, Brown and Rowe during
the Communist-called strikes in Victoria
and South Australia also, could perhaps
be discounted if it were not made more
mischievous by Ministers’ own tenden-
tious statements. As a sample of these
Mr. Ward —shortly before the last elec-
tions —said “Australia should begin to
think along Soviet lines” ; and Mr. Hollo-
way, as Acting Attorney-General, resist-
ing in the House last October an Opposi-
tion demand for investigation into Com-
munist activities, hailed these gangsters
as Christlike: —
If I were to permit myself to be drawn
into a philosophical discussion, I could
show that every aim of the Communist
movement throughout the world is based
on the teachings of Christ.
Which became something like blasphemy,
too, when he disclosed, in an interjection,
that the real reason why he would not
“permit himself to be drawn” was that
he did not want to prejudice his party’s
chances in the impending elections in
Victoria.
For the same reason Mr. Chifley will
do nothing today because he does not
want to imperil his referendum appeal
now about to warm up. “Labor’s” hopes
hang on it, Mr. Speaker Roseyear re-
cently warned a Sydney Domain audi-
ence, and what it seeks is a regimentation
of all commercial business in the land
—powers for which the Communists are
working with wholehearted energy.
There again the Chifleyites and the Com-
munists are entirely agreed.
With his refusal Mr, Chifley has pro-
nounced his “Government’s” doom, and
the knell of its passing bell can be heard
already. There is this further effect:
that “Labor” is driving the Liberal party
—long disinclined on principle to declare
for repressive measures —into a new
understanding with the Country party on
the necessity for some such action at the
first opportunity. Mr. Chifley tried to
make play with a jibe that Mr, Menzies
had no suggestions to offer about ways
and means of uprooting this evil. That
assisted him over some facetious moments,
but it does not fit in with the reality of
the Victorian Liberal Premier’s Essential
Services Act of last December-—which
put the wind up the wreckers in that
State—or with the Victorian Deputy
Premier’s announcement last week of a
further Bill, to be submitted shortly to
Parliament, to declare the Communist
party illegal and prescribe heavy penal-
ties on those adjudged guilty of subver-
sive actions.
The lesson from Queensland is that if
the Commonwealth will not do the job,
then the States, in sheer self-protection,
must. The lesson from Canberra is that
since “Labor” refuses, then the Liberal-
Country parties must come to the rescue.
The definite assurance that they will do
so is all the electors are waiting for.
They Can't Do It!
In the Commonwealth Constitution it is
prescribed that the number of members
of the House “shall be, as nearly as prac-
ticable, twice the number of Senators”
(Section 24) and that “the term of service
of a Senator,” except in the case of a dis-
solution, “shall be taken to begin on the
first day of July following the day of
his election” (Section 13). There is no
easy way of altering the first requirement,
and none is proposed. But to secure an
advantage for Our Party, in the process
bringing more “Labor” politicians under
the plum-tree and giving it a vigorous
shake, it is proposed to alter the second by
Act of Parliament —if jt can be done.
The provision in the original instru-
ment was that “the term of service of a
Senator shall be taken to begin on the
first day of January, following the day
of his election,” and, after a dissolution,
“on the first day of January preceding
the day of his election.” This, together
with the fact that the first Commonwealth
Parliament did not begin to sit till May
9, 1901, led to complications, and July
was substituted in each case by virtue
of the Constitution Alteration (Senate
Elections), 1906. Specifically to get
over the complications it was provided
that the terms of service of the Senators
whose places would, “but for this Act,”
become vacant at the expiration of 1909
and of 1912 should be extended to June
30, 1910, and June 30, 1913, respectively.
Deakin was Prime Minister throughout
1906. Isaacs was his Attorney-
General and No. 2 till October 12 of
that year. Each, of course, helped to
frame the Constitution, and as framers
and legislators knew it inside-out. Neither
had any doubt that the changes required
the sanction of the people given at a
referendum. Sanctioned they were, at a
poll taken on December 12, 1906, by
majorities in each State and in the Com-
monwealth (774,011 to 162,470), a result
paralleled at only one subsequent refer-
endum —State Debts, on November 17,
1928.
There has been one dissolution of the
Senate and —necessarily—of the House,
also ; that of the first German-war year.
Thirty-six senators were elected on Sep-
tember 5, 1914, and in the terms of the
Constitution Alteration (Senate Elec-
tions) they became entitled to take
their seats when Parliament met —as it
did —on October 8. Also in the terms of
that enactment, as ratified by referendum,
18, Senators elected on May 5, 1917,
qualified immediately for active member-
ship—Parliament met on June 14. In no
subsequent case has this happened. Since
1917 every Senate election (there was
none in 1929) has taken place towards
the end of the year, and six to nine
months have elapsed before Senators then
elected could be sworn in.
Desiring not to serve the people, but
to consolidate its waning power by the
fabrication. of safe seats, the “Labor”
Caucus plans to increase the number of
Ms.H.R. from 75, with the Northern
Territory man, to 123, including a public-
service nominee at Canberra; it is hoped
that the nomination will go to the word-
spinner Fraser, fleeing * from Eden-
Monaro. That, to keep the party in
control of both Houses, as well as to
satisfy the constitutional requirement in
Section 24, would necessitate 24 new
Senators.
It is immaterial to Caucus that new
Senators would be excrescences, except
such as came from new States by the
normal and healthy process followed in
the U.S.A. throughout its history; and
to new States “Labor” is opposed. In-
deed, “Labor” has hitherto professed to
stand for the abolition of the Senate.
Enlargement of the Senate at the cost of
this “ ‘Labor’ principle” and at the
actual cost to the taxpayers of £36,000
p.a. in Senators’ salaries alone has be-
come necessary to “Labor’s” plans.
For the present Parliament cannot func-
tion in its fashion beyond November 6,
1949, the third anniversary of its first
sitting (“every House shall continue for
three years from the first meeting of the
House and no longer, but may be sooner
dissolved”—Section 28); and thereupon
writs must be issued within ten days
(Section 32). Nor can the new Parlia-
ment meet any “later than 30 days after
the day appointed for the return of the
writs” (Section 5): as a rule ten or eleven
weeks elapse between the expiry of a
Parliament and the first meeting of its
successor. So a dissolution in November,
1949, would mean a meeting of the
new Parliament in February, 1950,
with, if the first part of the “Labor”
plan goes through, 123 members of the
House and, if the second part miscarries,
36 Senators. That would be a flat viola-
tion of Constitutional Section 24, and
until the 24 new Senators arrived, if they
ever did, all the proceedings of Parlia-
ment would be open to legal challenge.
And there would be no lack of people-
people maddened by overtaxation and, in
the latest evil example of prodigal expen-
diture, by the spectacle of £550,000 of
funds extracted from them being voted in
gifts to the Communist police States,
Poland, Yugoslavia and Hungary—ready
to challenge them.
It is asserted that “Labor’s” legal
advisers (i.e., Dr, Evatt and his young
men) have “solved the constitutional
problem.” The “legal advisers” have
“drafted a bill providing for the election
of Senators for varying periods” on one
of those “formulas” in which Dr. Evatt
delights. This is the “formula” as set
out in the friendly “Daily Telegraph”:
Eighteen Senators (three from each State)
will be elected for the normal term of six
years. They will not take their seats until
June, 1950 [really July I], as the 18 re-
tiring Senators will not vacate their seats
until June’ 30.
Twelve Senators (two from each State)
will be elected for years. They will
take their seats immediately.
Twelve Senators (two from each State),
will be elected for 3* years [They also will
“take their seats immediately”—if they can],
retiring when the general elections are
held in 1952.
“Adoption of this system”—the “Daily
Telegraph” proceeds —“will mean that in
1952 half the enlarged Senate will retire,
as required by the Constitution.”
There is no such Constitutional require-
ment. After the first Commonwealth
elections and after the 1914 dissolution,
as was laid down in Section 13, the 36
Senators were divided into six-year men
(the first three elected in each State) and
three-year men, but between those elec-
tions and since the Section-13 prescrip-
tion has been observed, as it had to be:
“Afterwards the places of Senators shall
become vacant at the expiration of six
years from the beginning of their term of
service.” Eighteen Senators chosen in
1903 were elected for six years, and so
were those of the 1917 and all succeeding
vintages. As stated, the terms of the
1903 and 1906 Senators were extended
for six months, and from time to time
a nominee Senator has served out the
remainder of a deceased or retired
Senator’s term unless (as has sometimes
happened) he failed of election in the
meantime. But this was all done in strict
conformity with the Constitution as
originally accepted by the people and as
altered, with their approval, in 1906.
Deakin’s Constitution Alteration (Sen-
ate Elections) contained a clause per-
tinent to the plot now projected:
“This Act shall not be taken to alter the
time of beginning of the term of service
of any Senator elected in 1906.” In
contempt of the people, whom Deakin
consulted as a matter of duty, and of the
Constitution, which specifies that “the
Senators shall be chosen for six years
(Section 7, repeated in Section 13), be-
ginning on July 1, “Labor,” for its own
putrid purposes, is bent on altering the
beginning and end of the term of service
of the 24 new Senators it wants to wish
on the country—the end to 3i years for
a dozen and years for the other dozen.
“Labor” can’t do it. If it tries to brmg
off any increase of members without a
referendum or a dissolution or both, the
next Parliament, whatever Government
is in office, may have a brief and barren
life.


PLAIN ENGLISH
Keane's Dollars.
Delivering the N.S.W. Full Court’s
judgment for Joseph Goldberg on that
worthy’s appeal against his conviction in
the Keane Trunks Case, Chief Justice
Jordan said it was “curious, to say the
least, that Goldberg should have been
selected as the person to be charged.”
That is, charged with having smuggled
into Australia 4000-dollars’-worth of
American finery packed in four trunks,
labelled as for the widow of Senator
Keane, “Labor’s” 1941-46 Minister of
Trade and Customs (“Mrs. Keane —
personal effects mostly”), and forming
part of the luggage of a Miss Kelly, an
Import Procurement branch employee.
In the House last Wednesday Mr. Holt,
one of the legal members of the Opposi-
tion, asked the Attorney-General whether
he had noticed the Chief Justice’s com-
ment and had considered taking proceed-
ings against any other person. There fol-
lowed a notable exhibition of outraged
virtue, reminiscent of that which over-
came “Labor” and almost prostrated Mr.
Ward when it leaked out that Lawson,
one of Keane’s predecessors as Minister
of Trade and Customs, had leased a race-
horse from a sporting manufacturer with
whom he had negotiated a contract.
“S. M. Herald” report:
Dr. Evatt said that when the matter was
first raised in the House [it wasn’t raised
for months after the Customs had interro-
gated Goldberg, and on that occasion and
subsequently debate was forbidden] the
Government asked the Solicitor-General and
the Comptroller of Customs to recommend
what actiop should be taken.
Imputations had been made against the
late Senator Keane and against his wife.
The matter had been referred to a sub-
committee which had recommended that
Goldberg was the only person against whom
any evidence could be offered.
There was nothing curious about it, Dr.
Evatt said. The Full Court had to decide
whether Goldberg’s conviction was war-
ranted. The Court decided it was not, and
the Chief Justice’s comment was quite un-
justified.
It is without precedent for even a
“Labor” Attorney-General, using or
abusing the forms of the House, to let
fly at a greatly respected and admired
Chief Justice. As a K.C. of N. S. Wales,
Dr. Evatt must have known that the Chief
Justice had every right to say what he
said. On the issue of evidence, insufficient
against Goldberg, as the Court found,
the Chief Justice could, with perfect pro-
priety, have pointed out that none of
those who could have given first-hand
testimony had been called —neither Gold-
berg, who made the 4000-dollar pur-
chases, nor Keane’s secretary Kirk, who
gave instructions for the shipment ; nor
Kerr, the Import Procurement man at San
Francisco who labelled the trunks, nor
Miss Kelly nor Mrs. Keane. Only
Customs men went into the box, and after
the goods arrived at Sydney other
Customs men were concerned in the busi-
ness, nor did they, give evidence —as
Justice Street pungently observed, from
the arrival of the trunks to their arrival
and delivery in Melbourne “the whole
matter was handled by senior officers
concerned in enforcing the provisions of
the Act.” Indeed, Justice Street said “If
anybody imported the goods it would
rather seem to have been the Customs.”
The Attorney-General’s attempt at jus-
tification by “sub-committee” was inter-
rupted by “Opposition voices.” Moved
by the whole Keane affair, “Opposition
voices” cried “It smells to high heaven.”
“Smells” is right, but a mere five-word
interjection is not sufficient. Nothing less
will suffice than a full-dress debate on
Keane’s dollar transaction and a full in-
quiry by a tribunal empowered to call,
witnesses and to go into any other Keane
transaction that may emerge from the
darkness of an administration now fairly
under suspicion. If “Labor” gags debate
and burkes inquiry, as it may, so much
the worse for “Labor.”
Principles and Practice.
It was unfortunate for Dr. Evatt that
while he was debating the Opposition’s
censure motion against the Government
for failing to suppress Communism the
Australia First cases should rise up to
accuse him of a base hypocrisy.
“Unless some positive breach of the
law is proved or alleged against an in-
dividual,” said Doctor Evatt, “you should
not take action.”
Keith Bath, a fourth - generation
Australian, with an Australian-born wife,
two small boys, his own home and a
business earning up to £4OOO a year, was
taken, by security police, from his home
on the morning of March 9, 1942, and
dumped behind barbed-wire. No charge
was laid against him. War-time censor-
ship was used to prevent his defending
himself publicly. But the Communist
party was able at once to obtain his name
and publish it to the world as that of an
interned traitor.
A fortnight later, public indignation
having burst through the censorship in
Parliament, the only place in which free
speech on the matter was allowed at that
time by Dr. Evatt and his confreres,
Mr. Forde, then Minister for the Army,
accused Mr. Bath and others of having
been concerned in a plan to assassinate
public men, to sabotage military works so
as to make the defence of the country
impossible, and to meet the Japanese and
welcome them in case of invasion. No
evidence was produced, and none ever
has been. The charges were a paraphrase
of those in the indictment of the Rightists
and Trotskyites of 1938 at Moscow
(Bukharin, Radek, et al, all convicted
and shot), even embodying some of the
actual phrases in the Moscow indict-
ment. There was no foundation whatever
for them.
Bath was kept in internment for
several months. Under pressure of Par-
liament and the press Dr. Evatt, who
had left Australia for abroad the night
before Bath was arrested, was compelled
to release him. But Bath was forced to
report to the police like a criminal on bail
and restricted as to where he might live.
A diabetic, broken down by his illegal
internment, he was seized by the Curtin-
Evatt-Theodore forced-labor organisation
and sent to work as a navvy on the wet
bottom of the graving dock at Garden
Island.
Public opinion now compelled Dr.
Evatt to grant an investigation. The terms
of reference were so drawn that a full in-
quiry could not be held. After several
weeks, during which Bath was brow-
beaten and bullied in the box as if he
were a criminal, it was discovered that
there were no charges against him and
never had been any. The Crown was
prepared to admit that he was a loyal
citizen without a stain on his patriotism
or his character.
Even on the limited terms of reference
the Judge awarded him £5OO compensa-
tion and his costs, but it was poor com-
pensation for the ruining of an innocent
man.
Bath, after extraordinary delays on the
part of the Crown, issued a writ claiming
£25,000 damages. The Government put
in a feeble defence. It allowed the
case to be prepared for trial. When Bath
had incurred about £5OO in costs the
Attorney-General suddenly approached
the Court with an application to be
allowed to amend the Government plead-
ings—to plead that the action was statute-
barred because the time allowable under
the Statute of Limitations had elapsed
before Bath took action. The delays be-
hind all this had been a result of the
apparently calculating sloth of Dr. Evatt's
own department.
Apart from the fact that such a de-
fence by a Government in such a case
is about as moral as for a member of the
Stock Exchange to plead the Gaming Act,
the method adopted was abominable.
Neither Tito nor Stalin could have done
much worse. It was appropriate that poor
Bath should have been disabled by a
Communist-type blow below the belt
in a legal action against the Common-
wealth at the moment Dr. Evatt was mak-
ing excuses for not banning the Com-
munist party.
Braund and Cancer.
It was here stated (B. 11/2/’4B) that in
the interests of suffering humanity “a
fair and authoritative pronouncement
was needed on the Braund method” of
treating cancer; and that to reach a
speedy decision Braund himself should
give the utmost co-operation. A com-
mittee tardily appointed by the N.S.W.
Government has reported that the Braund
treatment will not cure cancer. A brief
history:
In December last year Sydney “Sun,”
after investigations, “discovered” John
Braund, a 78-years-old layman, and
cautiously put forward his claims, insisting
that they be proved or disproved. There
followed an uproar in the daily newspapers,
a furious controversy between doctors,
scientists and the public, showing
of Cinesound pictures of an actual
Braund “operation” which packed news-
reel theatres, world-wide publication of the
Braund claims and the appointment of the
committee. A sequel was the arrival by
air of hopeful cancer-sufferers from as far
away as Canada and New Zealand. Braund
himself never proved easy to deal with either
by critic or friend, and the committee
found him most “difficult.” Braund ad-
mitted that he had once been fined for a
breach of the Medical Practitioners’ Act,
but claimed he had been treating cancer
for 20 years and had 318 definite cures.
His “method” was to inject a mysterious
fluid into the patient which allegedly
“killed the cancer,” after which Braund
brought it to the surface and removed it.
The committee comprised Dr. E. S.
Morris, N.S.W- Director of Public
Health (chairman), Drs. A. J. Collins, B.
T. Edye, A. H. Tebbutt, T. Nisbet, G. H.
Deck, M. Barry and H. V. Gillies, and
Messrs. Treatt (Leader of the N.S.W.
Opposition), C. C. Lazzarini, M.LA.,
E. J. Hallstrom (a philanthropist willing
to donate £20,000 for a clinic if Braund’s
claims were proved) and H. L. Brose,
D.Sc. (who had supported Braund). Its
report, tabled in the N.S.W. Parliament
last Thursday, refuted Braund’s claims.
The Braund treatment could not cure
cancer nor retard its growth. Exploitation
of Braund’s alleged cure amounted to an
“outstanding public mischief with inter-
national ramifications.” Braund’s general
lack of co-operation with the committee
was incompatible with his alleged desire to
have his cure examined. His mysterious fluid
contained ordinary commercial alum, which,
injected into subcutaneous tissue, causes
death of the tissue and subsequent slough-
ing-off, which was claimed to be the cancer.
In no case examined by the committee was
Braund’s claim substantiated. Cancer-
sufferers had been misled and prevented
from obtaining proper treatment. Braund’s
conceptions of anatomy and physiology
were entirely wrong.
The committee was unanimous. Dr.
Morris said that Braund was a charlatan
and a fraud, and he attacked Dr. Brose
for his part in the affair. Dr. Brose
defended himself, and said he thought
Braund had been “treated too harshly.”
That may not be the end of it, even
though Premier McGirr, when asked
whether he intended to go further in the
matter, replied “The Government has
not considered it.” Braund, who had
ideas of establishing himself in Mel-
bourne, now proposes to “open a clinic
in the United States.” Mobility, appa-
rently, is part of his technique. t
Stain's Gold Pass.
The manner in which Dr. Evatt pre-
sented the report of the Committee of
Privileges to Parliament was a brilliant
demonstration of how democracy works
in Canberra.
Mr. Mulcahy’s charge against Mr.
Blain, made under privilege of Parlia-
ment, was that he had used his Parlia-
mentary gold pass vyhile a prisoner-of-
war in the hands of the Japanese to
secure special treatment. Though the
Government did its utmost to avoid an
inquiry, angry public opinion, for once,
succeeded in forcing it to investigate. A
Committee of Privilege was appointed
with, of course, a majority of Govern-
ment supporters —it comprised Dr. Evatt
(chairman), Messrs. Clark, Sheehan, Wil-
liams, Spender and Abbott. The com-
mittee met in secrecy despite all protests
from the press and members of the Oppo-
sition.
It was decided not to call Messrs.
Johnson, Gleeson and Hart —referred to
by Mr, Mulcahy on January 20, 1948,
for whose appearance Mr. Abbott
moved.
The committee reported that it had
before it the evidence of the member for
the N.T. and a number of statutory
declarations by p.-0.-w. associated with
him in captivity. These supported his own
sworn declaration and evidence that there
was no impropriety in his use of his pass.
The member for Lang also gave evidence,
and a number of documents were
tendered.
The committee found:
(a) That the member for the Northern
Territory while a prisoner-of-war did not
wrongfully use his Parliamentary privileges.
( b ) That there was no impropriety of
any description in the use of his Parlia-
mentary pass while a prisoner-pf-war in
the hands of the Japanese,
(c) That in the matter referred to the
Committee of Privilege by the House no
breach of privilege of the House has been
committed by the member for the Northern
Territory.
At 10.50 p.m. on Thursday night, April 8,
when the House was almost empty, when
the press gallery had completely lost in-
terest in the debate. Dr. Evatt stepped to
the table of the House and softly laid
the report upon it. The Opposition was
so much taken unawares that it did not
even move that it be printed, thus losing
a chance to initiate a debate.
The evidence was not attached to the
report. It is available for members to
see, but it is guarded by privilege, and
must not be shown to the press. The
Government would appear to be afraid of
what it contains and will not let it out.
But now that the contemptible charge
against the wounded, jailed and mutilated
Digger has been entirely exploded, the
maker of it should be expelled from the
House if he cannot show by the evidence
of others that he was completely and
foolishly misled.
Birds of a Feather.
Spotted in Canberra and Macquarie-
street:
It did not really require last week’s debates
in the House at Canberra and in the Assembly
at Sydney to make it clear that the Chifleys
and McGirrs would do nothing to Communists,
even though the future of their “Governments”
and parties depends on their doing something
to the Communist conspiracy—something with
boiling oil in it. With Communists they have
a common sympathy and hatred —the sympathy
of the “socialisation” objective, the hatred of
“capitalists,” with, in “Labor’s” case, influen-
tial exceptions like Mr. Wren and the book-
maker tribe—and of Communists they are as
terrified as ever.
Their attitude, feebly and evasively restated,
was fully anticipated. So, except in one quarter,
was the burden of Dr. Evatt’s long-delayed
speech on international affairs in which, by
implication at least, he held Washington and
Moscow equally responsible for the “drift to
war.” So, anyway, it seemed to the once-
devoted “S. M. Herald,” which was moved to
the scornful observation that “in foreign as
in domestic affairs the same spirit of appease-
ment, the same resolve to do nothing that
could irritate Russia, is evident.” In Sydney
the other Evatt, the one Who is Mr. McGirr’s
No-Housing Minister, declared “Fascism the
real danger today” and saw “potential Fascists”
all over the place, “even possibly in this
House,” where the two Opposition-leaders and
nearly all their followers who were of an age
to serve in either World War are returned
servicemen.
This Mr. Evatt is president of the Australian-
Russian Society, with Mrs. Jessie Street as
“senior vice-president.” Mrs. Jessie Street has
been attending another conference in the U.S.A.,
for which dollars must necessarily have been
provided, if not this time by the taxpayers.
Before she set out from Sydney she publicly
defended Moscow’s barbarous refusal to let
the Russian wives of British and American
soldiers and civilians join their husbands, her
“philosophy,” as Mr. Chifley would say, being
that Russia is always Right.
“Australia” [i.e.. Dr. Evatt, on other occasions
great on Human Rights] supported this
Oriental barbarity when the issue was raised
at a U.N.O. commission by a British represen-
tative, and Mr. Calwell, who sees “something
positive” in Communism, is extending it to this
country.
In Perth last week the Chinese wife and
stepdaughter of an Englishman, and a Tongan
lady married to another and their two children,
were ordered to quit somehow, with or without
their husbands, on Calwell-specified dates. The
Tongan lady is a cousin of that unique person-
age Queen Salote Tubou, G.8.E., who has links
with Australia as well as Britain. Two sons
were students at Newington College, Sydney.
The heartless expulsion of the Queen’s cousin,
who was married in her royal chapel, will have
nasty reactions among Fijians and Maoris as
well as Tongans.
The White Australia policy—conceived by
greater and more consistent minds than
Calwell’s always needed to be administered
with charity and humanity, and, in special
cases of hardship, with a generous acceptance
of what could not be mended. As
administered by Mr. Calwell, with Russian
methods added, it is apt to bring on
us an accumulation of hate, more especially as
gross discrimination is practised. For instance,
the deportation of a negro pugilist, forcibly
separated from his white wife and two children,
coincided with the arrival of two negro pugilists
for bouts at Wren boxing-halls, and the police-
State ultimatums in Perth with the advent there,
by Skymaster from Europe, via Asia and the
Dutch East Indies, of 40 Jews. The Jews
didn’t bothe.r about quarantine requirements,
knowing perhaps they had a friend at Court.
Mr. Lang has been a pertinacious critic of
Mr. Calwell and his proceedings and those of
his party and its Communist allies, and the
censure motion found the veteran with a pre-
pared list of proposals designed to hit the
Communist conspiracy at every point of its
nefarious operations, and also, of course, with
a prepared speech. He wasn’t permitted to
deliver it.
Mr. Rosevear, while giving the call to nonen-
tities, failed to “see” the man who faced up
to “Balance-sheet” Thornton and saw that
unspeakable Communist “squib” on a writ for
libel and pay costs. Mr. Scully, who gets a
Ministerial salary for moving the gag, moved
it to silence his former leader; and the gag
was supported by Messrs. Mulcahy, Sheehan,
Lazzarini and James. All these politicians were
members of Mr. Lang’s Federal party, and, with
Mr. Rosevear, who remained in it with Messrs.
Mulcahy and Sheehan when it became the
non-Communist Labor party, they owe their
political existence to his patronage. Their in-
gratitude is equalled only by their lack of guts.
Sob-stuff for Alibi.
From beside the Molonglo’s weeping
willows:
What Chifley needs is to consult a psychia-
trist. The administration of the country is
hardly safe in the charge of a man so domi-
nated by his sob-sister emotions.
Parliament has had from him seemingly
broken-hearted explanations of how the 1930
depression repeatedly overcomes him in any-
thing more than perfunctory excursions in
debate. Hitherto he has rung the changes on
that and the injustice done to one of his
forbears sometime, somewhere, by some bank.
The hoarseness of his voice aggravated by
emotion and constant smoking—becomes over-
whelming as he struggles through such passages.
He seems to be submerged in a flood of memory
of ancient wrongs done to himself or somebody.
In last week’s debate it was the 1917 strike
—an illegal strike, incidentally, called at the
height of Australia’s First World War effort, and
one from which, during the war, the home front
never recovered. “Because somebody was harsh
and repressive (half-sob) I, a common engine-
driver (trip sob), became, with the assistance of
my comrades, Prime Minister of this country.
But for that you would not have had me even
a member of Parliament.”
At which the audience is supposed, presum-
ably, to unharden its stony heart and forgive
everything to one who has suffered so much
and for so long. Why cavil at the terms of a
Bank Grab Bill when the sponsor of it is so
obviously actuated by the griefs of all suffering
humanity, and his own searing self-repressions?
The House on Wednesday learned also how
Chifley is perpetually tortured in these no-
confidence motions by insinuations that only
his political adversaries love Australia. “Here
I am,” he says, in effect, “an honest worker
called to this high post, and only capsizing the
whole apple-cart in my best endeavors to pre-
vent the workers being crucified, and I am
accused of not loving our country You ask
me to repress these wicked Communists, whose
philosophy I hate. I won’t do it; it would not
only be wrong in the sight of every crucified
worker, but I cannot repress even myself when
I think about it.” That is the spirit of his
constant apologia.
How long is this sob-stuff to pass for states-
manship in a land fast heading for anarchy?
I for one have heard enough of it to suspect
that, when he has hurried out of the Chamber
“wiping his streaming eyes,” Chifley turns to
his handkerchief-holder and says “.Well, how
did that go?”

Fresh from his victory over the Com-
munists, Hanlon arrived at Mascot air-
port (Sydney) to be greeted by a gang
of Communist larrikins, who drove up and
away in new-model cars. To their abuse
he replied “The Queensland workers have
had you Reds. They’re going to get rid
of the lot of you.” Later he said of the
comrades: “They are the representatives
of a foreign organisation that has to be
cleared up in Australia.” Then he went
on his way to meet McGirr and Chifley,
both of whom are busily engaged in not
raising a finger to assist in the clearing-
up.
No member at Canberra has come on
more than Anthony. Very rough when
he arrived from Richmond in November,
1937, a fighter in the raw but little more,
Anthony has so improved his knowledge
by study and his speaking by practice
that he is now one of the most effective
debaters in the House. His speech on
the censure motion, in which he con-
trasted the self-pity of Chifley, the 1917
striker, with the sufferings of the Diggers
in Flanders, and riddled the anti-Com-
munist pretensions of Dr, Evatt, deserved
more than a few lines in the papers and
even an A.B.C. broadcast. The Country
party should publish it as a referendum
pamphlet.
“N.Q. Register” on Runaway Rowe:
The car in which he travelled was painted
a beige color when he left. It is now
painted green, with a red grille in front.
Rowe arrived at the Brisbane Trades Hall
on the floor of a car, hidden under the
skirts of two women.
“Under” can scarcely be right, even if
the skirts had the New Look. But to
the bailiff who conducted him to quod
—yes, a bailiff! —the fellow said “This
will stjjirt the biggest thing Australia has
known,” other Corns, beefing out similar
threats. “The biggest thing Australia
has known” petered out on the fifth day
in an abject apology to the Industrial
Court, and the fellow melted into the
night with A.E.U. demands for his dis-
missal roaring in his ears.
Justly indignant at Beer - Pump
Mulcahy’s attack on Blain, and at
“Labor’s” shielding of the slanderer, Mel-
bourne “Herald” had a note with which
veterans of each world war (Blain was a
veteran of both, while Mulcahy was a
distant observer) will go all the way:
If the decencies of public life are to be
fully upheld, Parliament must not only be
prompt in investigating any charge' against
the honor of a member but must censure
those who make untfue and damaging state-
ments. There has been a shabby failure
to do this in the Blain case.
On one, point, however, the “Herald”
slipped: “Mulcahy expressed regret.” To
the end of last week the fellow had not
“expressed regret,” in Parliament, on the
platform or in the press. Had his foul
offence been committed in the Commons
he would have been expelled, as for a
far less flagrant affair Labor-member
AUighan was expelled at the instance of
Herbert Morrison; and Allighan had
had war service in the Royal Navy.
When the Victorian Parliament reopens
on April 27 the Hollways will submit
legislation which will provide for drastic
penalties against organisations found
guilty of subversive activities and persons
found guilty of conspiring against the
State. This was announced while
“Federal” “Labor” was giving the latest
of its many exhibitions of crawling to
Communists, immediately preceded by
presents of wool—which, as Lang’s
“Century” suggests, will doubtless be
used for military uniforms —to Commu-
nist Poland (£250,000-worth). Communist
Yugoslavia (£150,000) and Communist
Hungary (£150,000).
The Cains seem to have learned nothing
from their smashing defeat at the
Assembly elections. Anyway, Cain says
his party will oppose the Hollway-Mc-
Donalds’ legislation against Communists
because “it would drive them under-
ground, and I prefer to have my enemies
in the open where I can see them.” One
reason why his party went down is that
Cain Ministers, their tails drooping, used
to “see them” in “Government” offices
with closed doors.
One of many strong points made by
S. Lockhart in his presidential speech at
the Victorian C.P. conference:
What purport to be advertisements for
savings campaigns and Government loans
carry slogans advocating the supposed
virtues of price-fixing. All this publicity,
of course, is paid for by the taxpayers, it
is almost as blatant a misuse of public
funds as the expenditure by the “Govern-
ment” on advertising its case at the 1944
referendum when some £300,000, and prob-
ably more, of the taxpayers’ money was
spent in direct publicity for the Govern-
ment’s proposals.
The Attorney-General questioned a heap
of that expenditure, but Calwell just
brazened it out. He said it was for
“post-war education,”
Historical note for Australia’s five (5)
“service” Ministers. On April 10, 1940,
in Narvik Fjord, four British destroyers
sank six German supply ships and an
ammunition ship and damaged two de-
stroyers. Three days later Warspite and
her screen sank nine German destroyers
in not many more minutes. With the
world contemplating war again the sea-
going strength of the R.A.N., controlled
by a Mr. Riordan, is one cruiser, five
destroyers (two of them old), and four
frigates.
Four years ago Wisconsin blasted
Wendell Willkie’s hopes of becoming
President; badly in the “pri-
mary,” he withdrew from the contest.
Now it has blasted the hopes of Mac-
Arthur, if not those of Dewey; 20 Wis-
consin delegates will go to the Republi-
can convention charged to vote for Stas-
sen. But no President or even a Vice-
President has come from Wisconsin,
or from Stassen’s Minnesota, and
there are many other obstacles to be
surmounted by Stassen, Governor
Warren, of California, now the No. 3
State, with three times the population of
Wisconsin, may beat all the fancied candi-
dates.
What does it matter whether the “Aus-
tralian” Communist “party” has 27,000
members, or 20,000, as alleged by
Chifley-Evatt “Security” officers? “In
Rumania I saw a Communist party with
fewer than 300 members take over that
country,” said Douglas Hyde, the London
newspaperman who was on the Com-
munist “Daily Worker” for eight years
and had been news-editor for five years
when he left paper and party. Hyde
gave as his main reasons for quitting
“the behavior of the Russian troops” (in
the frenzied months of victory they
robbed and raped like savages); the
Rumanian affair (“I didn’t expect the
party to take in every Fascist and career-
ist that came along”); and the extinction
of the non-Communist groups in Czecho-
slovakia —“the last straw.”
Thousands of misled A.R.U. men in
Hanlon’s State are pulling out of the
Communist-controlled union. Their ex-
ample is likely to be followed in N. S.
Wales, as a result of A.R;U. men being
dragged into the Communist blockade of
Queensland. That occurred after McGirr,
with Hartigan weakly conniving, had
ordered N.S.W. railwaymen not in the
A.R.U. to join it “or else.”
Sydney “D.T.,” discussing Sydney s
brewery strike* admits to astonishment
at its public’s being “surprisingly apathetic
about the catastrophe .” It is the “D.T.’s”
proud boast that it “gives Australia
leadership.”
Pollard, Chifley’s wheat Minister, who
has assumed “control” of jute and flax, bit
like a snake when Sullivan, a Nationalist
M.P. visiting Melbourne, said N.Z.
needed more Australian wheat at the
Scully-Pollard price—ss. 9d., volun-
tarily increased by the N.Z. Government
to 6s. 3d. “A wishful thinker,” snapped
Pollard ; “New Zealand will get no more
wheat at that price.” He’s hoping that
the International Wheat Agreement,
which takes effect on August 1, will
cancel out the crazy deal. Even if it does,
it won’t get Pollard’s bunch out of dis-
favor with the wheatgrowers, who have
beep making nasty comments on that
agreement, echoed in Perth by Hollway,
Playford and McLarty, whose Govern-
ments were never consulted.
It is nearly three years since Japan
surrendered. In that time Queensland has
“allocated” 50 farming and grazing blocks
to ex-servicemen. This “progress” would
be dreadful if confined to one State, but
it is common to all. And the almighty
Commonwealth seems more interested in
holding up soldier-settlement than in pro-
moting it.
Liberal Premiers McLarty, Hollway
and Playford at their meeting in Perth
decided to ask for a royal commission
on the financing of the States under uni-
form taxation. They won’t get it, but if
their States don’t get a bigger share of the
loot they are in danger of going bung.
That goes also for the three “Labor”
States, even though stacks of easy
money were hoarded in N. S. Wales and
Queensland during the war.
When Bunnerong power-rationing (to
last “for years”) descends on Sydney
electricity-users this winter, factories will
have to close for half a day or the
equivalent every week. The County
Council chairman says there will be no
lost time “if employees begin half an
hour earlier and finish half an hour later
on four days, to make up for the lost
half-day when industry closes down,”
What a chance for the strikemongers
to hold up another city—Sydney this
time.
Headline from Sydney “Sun”:
Jews Execute Four Britons.
The reference was to four British soldiers
seized in their camp unarmed and shot in
the back. Execution implies the carrying
out of a death sentence resulting from
legal process. Doesn’t the “Sun” know
there is no synonym for murder?
Dr. Evatt, objecting to the reimposi-
tion of the ban on Communist organisa-
tions which he himself promised five
years ago if they failed in their “under-
takings” :
Just imagine the extraordinary difficulties
and injustices that might occur in connection
with a law of that nature!
There is no imagination about the “extra-
ordinary difficulties” Queensland women
found in feeding themselves and children
during the lawless Communist strike.
Nor were Melbourne people imagining
their “extraordinary difficulties” when
they had to get to work without transport.
Nor does there belong to the realm
of imagination the injustice —or
criminal idiocy—of having main naval
dockyards, shipping and transport unions,
coalmines and wharves infested with Reds
who scratch when Stalin itches.
Dr. Evatt says the Commonwealth
Government had every right to plead
the Statute of Limitations (equivalent of
the Gaming Act) against the claim of
Keith Bath, interned for many months
under war-time powers—wrongfully, as
an Evatt-appointed royal commission
testified —for £25,000 damages. The doctor
pleads that his “Government” had volun-
tarily (or perforce) paid Bath £5OO, But
by what right does the party liable
claim the privilege of assessing “adequate
damages”?
Chifley, prompted by Haylen, chided
Melbourne’s Lud Mayor Connelly for
driving to Sydney in a Rolls-Royce. It
wow surprising of Connelly, whom Mel-
bourne deservedly holds in high regard as
a good Australian, but he may in this
instance have been corrupted by “Labor”
examples. On any road out of Sydney
at almost any time, and always at the
week-end, Commonwealth cars can be
seen tearing in all directions. Their ren-
dezvous is often a racecourse, and they
have been seen outside a pub. And week-
enders at Jervis Bay were edified when a
“Labor” Minister arrived —in a Rolls-
Royce.
That pretentious prig Fraser (“Labor,”
Eden-Monaro) has had another rush of
rubbish to the head:
If Communists are traitors to Australia
because they support Soviet Russia, are not
Liberals also traitors because they support
the United States in its struggle with Russia?
If attempts to have the Communist pai;ty
banned succeed nothing is more certain
than that the Country party will press for
a ban on the Labor party.
If Fraser believes there is any logic in
the first statement or truth in the second
he’s being wasted as a private member.
He’s* fatuous enough for a place in the
Cabinet.
Congratulations to Russian Minister
Lifanov on his return to Australia after
a trip to Moscow. He must have a
strong constitution. Other Soviet diplo-
mats, returning home after a few years’
sojourn in foreign parts, have found the
climate of the Workers’ Fatherland in-
jurious to their health.
The latest suggestion for making
Victoria immune from the whims of
N.S.W. coalminers came from the State
president of the Country-party women.
The determined woman said the section
should set up its own mine and work it
with women sick and tired of hearing
about coal shortages. The cries of ap-
proval threatened the integrity of the
roof.
Out in Eric Harrison’s Sydney electo-
rate of Wentworth, where the great and
near-great sleep in South Head cemetery
and the Macquarie Light warns and wel-
comes the seafarer, the citizens have en-
countered a new publication. Roneoed

Sequels to the Queensland strike :
A.R.U. men are damoring to resign and
join other unions. They’ve been “ordered to
give three months’ notice and pay six months
dues. Led by lan Spence, ex-R.A.A.F., mem-
bers of the Carpenters’ Union got a Supreme
Court interim injunction to restrain the union
bosses from preventing members attending meet-
ings and exercising their rights. Spence said tne
secretary, Dawson, had tried to force members
to pay a 10s. levy to assist strikers, and
another member said he had been refused an
“o.k. card” until he paid the 10s. (withholding
o.k. cards is a favored form of blackmail in
Com.-run unions). Carpenters packed the
Trades Hall and counted out their Communist
bosses. Then they withdrew to prepare an
application for deregistration so that new officers
could be elected by secret ballot under Court
supervision.
Under the paternal care of Dr. Evatt’s
Stevedoring Industry Commission the
Brisbane wharfies couldn’t lose by the
strike. With ships tied up everywhere
they went to work at 4s. 2id. to
Bs. sd. an hour and 12s. appearance-
money for anyone missing the pick-up
on a shift. They had the face to demand
“flea-money,” and then “dust-money,
for loading grain sorghum. They were
knocked back. They sought advances
on theft pay and were knocked back
again. No wonder the “N.Q. Register’
believes Queensland should demand an
inquiry into “the activities and peculiar
set-up” of the S.I.C.
Chifley is to visit Queensland early
next month to “engage in a big drive
for the Prices Referendum.” On his 1944
referendum (“Post-war Reconstruction
and Democratic Rights”) Queenslanders
voted 216,262 for and 375,802 against.
And there had been no sell-out to the
Communists of the Waterside Workers
Federation and the Seamen’s Union then.

“Yipe”; “Women have misunderstood
me,” declared Christian Dior, Parisian
designer and exhumer of the “New
Look,” at a big reception:
When I designed the long skirt, I in-
tended it merely for cocktail wear I
designed one skirt. One! Does that mean
that it is for street, office and sportswear?
Women have gone too far.
My only interest in the “New Look” was
purely financial, and as the wife shies off
cocktail-parties I thought I had a case.
When I told her the words of this French-
man who has had more publicity than
any designer since Dr. Guillotin, she re-
torted, “But what would he or any other
man know about such things?”

“Zake”: Those who love circumlocu-
tory tergiversation as well as those who
lift up their hands in horror at hearing
blunt truth will generally approve the
use of that modern term “de facto
wife.” Calamity Calwell uses it in
season and out, especially when, be-
tween those periods when he is busily
engaged arranging passports for Commos
“And this is the little Woman — never idle!”
to go among the teeming millions of Asia
inciting them to violent hatred of the
White Australia policy, he is spectacularly
arranging to deport a few more Malays
or Chinese. Before the cult of the phrase
became popular a woman who took up
residence with a man without benefit of
clergy was simply a “kept woman.” The
term was terse, clear and unmistakably
exact. Moreover, the phrase added that
spice to womanly gossip which comprises
half its charm. But fancy spitting out
“de facto wife” as a telling epithet! As
a plain man not addicted to referring
to spades as agricultural implements, I
cannot visualise a kept woman, or, in
the parlance of the classics, a “fairy,”
as a “wife,” whether embellished with
Latin or not. A wife, to me, is simply
a married woman. But my chief quarrel
with it is on the aesthetic side. Unques-
tionably the keen edge of Byron’s pleasure
would have been dulled if he had heard
it said of him, not that he had taken a
new mistress, but that he was living with
another de facto wife.

“Clooter”: A custom that should be
more widely cultivated is that indulged
in by the Sydney Millions Club—among
others —of inviting some worthy person
to address the members on the subject in
which he is interested. A development
of the old-fashioned after-dinner speech,
it has the improvement that there is but
one speech, limited as to length and with
no compulsion to stay and listen to it.
Thus, those who happen to take lunch
at the club on that day are, if the speaker
has sufficient charm, removed briefly
from the daily whirl and, with a comfort-
able feeling under the waistcoat, taken
into spheres quite foreign to their every-
day experience. Interesting personalities
frequently bob up with tales of wonder
and delight, and the talks frequently
stimulate members themselves to exhibi-
tions of wit. Thus it was when the club
heard a speaker on the Barnardo Homes.
At the time the papers were full of the
Calwell edict of expulsion on a negro
boxer. Two members fell to discussing
the various orphan welfare societies.
“Yes,” said one, “there’s the Dreadnought
Boys, and Boys’ Town, and the Big
Brothers and” “And,” put in an-
other, “there’s the Alabama Kid move-
ment.”

“O’Johnno”: Funeral-cars fitted with
radio (B, 28/l/’48)? I travelled in one
a few months back, behind a hearse do-
ing a 10-mile journey to the cemetery;
three others were in the car, and, after
the procession got clear of the town, the
driver turned on the radio so that we
could have football results and a bit of
music. I don’t know whether the other
cars were similarly equipped, or what
folk along the roadside thought of it, but
the driver kept it going until we entered
the cemetery gates.

“Bramley”: It’s told of the British
petrol authorities. After a long and
hazardous process a motorist managed to
convince them that, owing to lack of
public transport, it was essential for him
to use his car to get to work. The fuel
board graciously allowed him enough
petrol to get to the factory, but as there
was a bus service available in the evening
he was not allowed juice for the return
trip.

Beatrice Grimshaw: Maud Gonne (B.
11/2/’4B) was certainly, 50 years ago, the
most beautiful woman in Ireland, if not
in the world. She
was 6ft tall, and so
perfectly propor-
tioned that her height
was seen as an ad-
vantage ; looking at
her majestic figure
you felt that an inch
off it, or on it, would
be a disaster. Her
large, blue-grey eyes
were beautifully set
in black lashes; her
features, classic in
regularity, were lit
with the enthusiasm
that directed all her
aims, social and
political. There were
no aids to beauty
in her day, but her
perfect complexion
and naturally-waving
dark - brown hair
needed none. I met
her at an evening
party in Dublin on
the day of the
Diamond Jubilee,
She entered the room
like a queen and
trailed long sable
draperies as she moved. “Well, Maud!
Who has died?” asked her host. In a
deep, musical voice she replied, “This
is mourning; I’m wearing it for the
Jubilee. I’ve been getting some of the
dear boys to break a few windows.” An-
other side of her character showed at the
Dublin horse show when, in a Worth-
masterpiece of turquoise, rose and gold,
she accompanied the Vice-regal party to
the stand, as one of themselves. Yeats,
then quite young, certainly was in love
with her, but in a somewhat poetic and
unreal way. Maud had many admirers,
yet she was 40 before she married Major
Mcßride —a marriage that did not last.

“Bo”: In the old days before social-

tioos with his milko and engage another,
our purveyor of lacteal sustenance hobbed
down from his iron-tyred cart, as did the
others of his kind who also used the
street in the small hours, and went about
his rites. He was a spectral figure, un-
seen and unheard. Now our milko drives
a rubber-tyred cart; he wears sneakers
and possibly his horse wears non-skids.
His technique is to drop the lid on the
concrete path, while in the dark he aims
with poor effect his milk into the jug,
which he then hurls into the servery-
box. Apparently deprived of the means
to pursue the scientific development of
his biceps, he does the next best thing
by pulling after him with his full strength
the heavy side gate. I can’.t tell him to
go to hell, because my socialistic alter-
native is a three-quarter-mile walk to the
shop. But I’m just working it out —if
I remove five hinge-screws of the gate and
leave the sixth one in barely sufficiently
to hold the gate upright as he hurls
himself at it while holding his four pints
—yes, I might try it.

“Plop”: It happened during the
Federal debate on the Reds. An Opposi-
tion member, using for a moment a
rapier instead of the bludgeons that had
been wielded before he took the floor;
“ and to illustrate my point I will
relate a little story from The Magic
Pudding.” He had nearly finished his
anecdote when an interjector let fly again.
“Order, order!” protested the Speaker.
“I want to hear what happens.”

“Barwon”; Crime and punishment? I
heard a harrowing instalment of a radio
serial the other morning. One of the
characters was interviewing a business
acquaintance who had just begun a long
prison sentence. He tried to cheer the
convict up by visualising the future when
the stretch would be completed, but
distant freedom offered no ray of hope
for the lag. The cause of his gloom came
over the ether in the quavering accents of
a strong man who has drained the bitter
dregs of despair; “They’ll never have
me back as a member of the golf club
again.” Unfortunately I laughed immo-
derately at that point, and in the ensuing
dressing-down I got from my wife the
rest of the dialogue was lost.

“Jasby”; One of the dailies reported
that a “survey of ‘drunkometers’ used in
80 American cities” showed that six
bottles of beer were enough to induce
intoxication. Beer-bottles used in the
States hold only 12 ounces, against 26
ounces packed in the Australian bottle,
when obtainable, and publication of the
cable brought howls of derision from
Sydney publicans and drinkers,’although,
with the beer strike in its fifth week, most
of them had to argue from memory.
Stories of men who can down 12
schooners while the clock strikes 12 or
swallow a full-sized pail of beer without
pausing for breath are being revived, and
the general opinion seems to be that as
a drinker the Yank is pretty small
potatoes. H. L. Mencken wouldn’t agree.
His Newspaper Days contains several
anecdotes of healthy drinkers of the
American newspaper world, the champion
of all being one Bill, a compositor of the
Baltimore “Herald.” Apparently comps,
in America, as in Australia, are renowned
drinkers; but Bill beat the lot. His col-
leagues acclaimed him “champion of the
Western Hemisphere,” and he did his best
to live up to it. He was reputed to be
capable of drinking 40 bottles at a session.
Mencken vouches for 32, swearing that
he did it —the italics are Mencken’s —
without once retiring from his place at
the bar. In Philadelphia, where the
“Herald” was produced for several weeks
after its Baltimore plant had been de-
stroyed by fire, Bill on successive nights
withstood between 20 to 30 challenges
from men who, until they saw him in
action, really thought they could drink
beer.

“Clinch”: Though males and females
in India live in promiscuity in village
hovels and city slums, a queer concept of
morality forbids kissing on a picture-
screen. After being used to the torrid
embraces of Hollywood lovers finishing a
picture it is amusing and refreshing to
watch the Indian hero and heroine, in a
rapture of connubial bliss, delightedly
shaking hands in the fade-out.

“Cauboy”: Stage fights are generally
failures, and the one in “Faust” during the
Australian opera season at the Princess,
Melbourne, was no exception. When
the Gonsalez Co. staged “Lohengrin” in
the same theatre Frederick fell dead when
the hero merely waved his sabre, and
many ill-informed critics waxed very
facetious about it. The producers were
quite right—Wagner made it clear that
the sword was a magic weapon and there
was* not the slightest necessity to stick
the villain in the brisket. The worst stage
fight I have ever witnessed was one on
which the producers lavished all their
ingenuity to make realistic. That was in
“Is Zat So?” at Melbourne Royal. The
hero knew so little about the noble art
that when he gave his opponent —a pro-
fessional bruiser hired for the occasion—
the final knock-out, he hit him on his
chest, a portion of his anatomy on which
a battering-ram would have made no
impression.

“G.M.”: Kangaroo Courts (B.
14/1 /’48)? A writer in “Harper’s Maga-
zine” described these institutions 50 years
ago. They probably have not changed
much since. He related his experience in
one “Court” in the county jail of New
York State, where he and three other
petty offenders, after hearing sentence,
were led into a large hall where about
20 other prisoners greeted them and, after
preliminary questioning, gave them a
“kangaroo trial”;
A tall fellow who was the “Judge” in-
structed a halfgrown companion, whom he nick-
named “the searcher,” to bring his charges
against the newcomers. He approached us
solemnly and said “Prizners, you is charged
with having boodle in yer pockets. Wha’ does
yer plead, guilty or not guilty?” I was the first
in line, and pleaded not guilty. “Are ye willin’
to be searched?” asked the “Judge.” “I am,
your Honor,” I replied. Then the searcher in-
spected all my pockets, the lining of my coat,
the leather band inside my hat, my shoes and
socks, and, finding nothing in the shape of
money, declared I was guiltless. “You are
discharged,” exclaimed the “Judge,” and the jury-
men ratified the decision with a grunt. The
next case also pleaded not guilty and allowed
himself to be searched, but unfortunately he
had forgotten a solitary cent in his vest pocket.
It was quickly confiscated and he was remanded
for trial on the charge of contempt of the
“Kangru” After the trials were over the con-
fiscated money—they got about three and a half
dollars from the other two —was handed to the
genuine turnkey with instructions that it be in-,
vested in tobacco. Later the tobacco was brought
in and equally divided among the prisoners. The
next day I, with the other later arrivals, was
initiated as a member of the Kangaroo Court.
I had to promise that I .would <l° m y share of
all the cleaning and washing, and also be honest
and fair in judging the cases which might come
up for trial The Courts command the
respect of jailbirds, and if a prisoner insults the
Court he is punished very severely. It avails him
nothing to complain to the authorities. He has
too many against him, and the best thing he
can do is to become one of them as soon as
possible.
AN UNASSAILABLE PROPOSITION.
“Money is something that is widely accepted for
the settlement of debts.” —Extract from a memoran-
dum presented to the Court by Dr. Evatt in the Bank
Grab Case, and characterised by opposing counsel
as “a sound and logical submission.”
Money, what is it? Well, with quite unstinted
Accord the lexicographers agree
It’s gold or other metal duly minted
And stamped by Government authority,
Or bits of paper similarly printed
And issued to be used as currency—
The latter sort of token, by the way,
Being more frequent at the present day.
What bulky volumes have been writ about it,
From the dim fields astute financiers range
To poets’ elegies on being without it,
The long-established medium of exchange.
Can more be said on money? One would doubt
it.
But here is something new and rare and strange
Evolved from Dr. Evatt’s bonded store
Of philological and legal lore.
True wit is something, vide Pope’s assertion,
“That oft was thought but ne’er so well ex-
pressed.”
And of all views on boodle Evatt’s version
Should surely rank the wittiest and best.
Think of the intellectual exertion
Required before he chucked it off his chest,
This dictum, whereon everybody must
Pronounce: “How apt, how apposite, how
just!”
Money? What more impressive definition
Than this could any uni. prof, invent?
Even the contumelious proposition
Styled by the dogs’-meat man “self-evident”
When, apropos his calling and condition,
The housemaid told him that he “wasn’t a
gent,”
Hardly suggests or indicates forsooth
A more profound, unchallengeable truth.
Money? It’s something that provides a way
with
Which current obligations are defrayed,
A very present help, a staff and stay with
Which debts, assuming they exist, are paid,
A precious article to work or play with,
Whatever your vocation, rank or grade.
A hackneyed you can’t ignore,
But never phrased so tellingly before.

"Pistols at twenty paces” was the
grim but fashionable solution to affairs
of honour in roistering Regency days.
Many a fashionable blood faced his
adversary over the sights of this very
duelling pistol which figured in a memor-
able meeting between H.R.H. Duke of
York and the Honourable Colonel Lennox at
Wimbledon Common in 1789. Although the cause
of the encounter is now forgotten H.R.H. lost a wig curl
the duel, testifying in the plainest way to the pistol’s accuracy.
Consistent accuracy in field shooting is only possible
with hard-hitting, precision sporting ammunition —
ammunition bearing the 1.C.1. Brand.

“Bosun’s Mate”: That stout little
typhoon-fighter (B. 24/3/ ’4B) recalls a
fine piece of seamanship. Destroyer
Nepal was running before a sea that
looked like an immense waterfall: one
enormous roaring mass of foam. Occa-
sionally, from out of this cataract, a
Himalayan sea would gain on her and
dash itself against her sides in a smother
of green and flung white. Down aft
the captain’s steward was trying to get
forrard. He waited for a lull, found it,
stepped from shelter and ran into a liquid
wall that crushed him through the port
rails and over the side. , The lifebuoy
sentry saw him go. In such a sea the
Old Man was, of course, on the bridge.
Through speakers he ordered Number
One to prepare lines and a buoy; the
engine-room to be ready with full power.
Then, conversationally, he said: “Stand-
by, I’m coming round.” Five degrees at
a time the destroyer edged round to meet
the frenzied seas. She rolled, and shook
as her propellers raced. Then over again
until the tom seas raced level with her
rails. A final hammer-blow against her
bow and she was round, slicing confi-
dently into the troughs. Such was the
skipper’s judgment no line was needed;
the steward reached out and grabbed the
lowered scrambling-net. Half an hour
later the surgeon-lieutenant, one hand
braced against the swaying bulkhead, Was
operating on a compound fracture of the
rescued man’s right leg.

“Emex”: The expansion of the Royal
Australian Navy, involving the acquisi-
tion of two light fleet aircraft-carriers,
means that more permanent officers will
be needed. To meet the demand the
board plans to introduce a special entry
system at the R.A.N. College at Flinders.
Hitherto the only boys eligible to enter
the college have been those who have
attained, or will attain, their thirteenth
year in their year of entry. These lads
spend four years at the college before
passing out and going to England for
fleet-training and technical courses. That
system will be continued, but will be sup-
plemented by a scheme under which
youths of 18 who have passed in certain
subjects at matriculation standard will
also be accepted. They will spend only
six months at the college before they go
to Britain, where they will do the same
training as cadet-midshipmen of the ordi-
nary entry class and, like them, will re-
turn to Australia as sub-lieutenants for
duty in RA.N, ships or at shore estab-
lishments.

“Post-Mark”: About 30 years ago,
when the old deaf parson Rev. Wilkin-
son was packhorsing to every house and
homestead in the Northern Territory, he
tore the address-label off a parcel. The
old man—he was over 70—with a speak-
ing-tube wound round his shoulders, his
specs flashing as his eyes glinted merri-
ment, used to bring out that label, pre-
tend to study it and hand it on with the
remark that it seemed a libellous address.
He had asked a city store to post his order
to Alice Springs. When he got there the
parcel awaited him, addressed: “Miss
Alice Springs, C/o Rev. W. Wilkinson,
Northern Territory.”

“Towns”: In the peak war period all
Townsville pubs collected a deposit of
Is. or more on their glasses. A Couple
“Airmail package for you, Mrs. Plunkitt !”
of quick-thinking Diggers spotted
a department-store notice stating that
a small consignment of glasses had
just arrived. They bought up all they
could carry, and when a pubbery whose
glass deposit had soared to Is. 6d.
was opened for business they found no
difficulty in getting rid of their stock at
that price. The deal netted them a clear
100 p.c., and the publican found himself
with an extra four dozen glasses which
he could have bought at Bid. each.

“Bob Fee”: I read in a Sydney news-
paper that a member of the staff of Com-
monwealth Land Sales Control is an ex-
pert with the abacus and can get faster
answers to some sorts of sums than
calculating-machine operators. I wonder
if he is my old acquairitance, at one time
a “loot” with Second Military Landing
Group. None who knew him will ever
forget his flying fingers as he flicked the
marbles across to tell us that the total of
something like a hundred sets of figures
was 34,567, or what-have-you, this repre-
senting the number of bodies we had
managed to get into the array of assault-
shipping at our disposal. A similar per-
formance, twice-repeated, told us that
we had 40-odd thousand tons of stores
and something like 7000 vehicles in the
holds of the same ships. And this all
done as quickly as we could call him the
figures ! It took hours of patient adding
to prove that this ex-ice-hockey champ.,
ex-mercantile clerk, who had been years
in China, was plumb right every time.
In those days, when the order of battle
could change hourly, he was a veritable
godsend. A blanky miracle, in fact, as
adding-machines were still frowned on by
the powers-that-were as being sissy.

dentally, were the crowd who fitted Ninth

“X.S.”: A Melbourne magistrate re-
cently had to adjudicate between two out-
raged persons. A passenger on a tram
tendered six halfpennies for a threepenny
fare, and the conductor curled his lip and
said sarcastically: “Have you any more
of them?” The insulted passenger sub-
sequently sought out the conductor and
stoushed him. The P.M. Said that as
coppers were legal tender the passenger
was within his rights, and the ticket-
puncher should not have been sarcastic.
On the other hand, the passenger
shouldn’t have taken the law into his own

“B. A. Ker”: Announced over the
radio as “The Anniversary Song,” sung
in a Yankee twang to words by Tin Pan
Alley, the tune was undeniably a pinch,
note for note, from the old waltz “Danube
Waves.” And it took me back about
25 years: The moonlight shone brilliantly
on a clearing in front of a grey slab hut.
Near the rough door, placed on a box
against the outside wall, a phonograph
wound out the dear old air. But the
music was not soothing the savage breasts
of the two young men who were whole-
heartedly endeavoring to punch each
other to unconsciousness. The one that
was consistently blocking the other’s
punches—with his face —was me. Yet I
was a willing martyr, for the speeding
eight-ouncers thudding into my tortured
tummy or jarring my jaw to the back
teeth gave practical substantiation to my
fervent belief that I was acting as sparring
partner to the future heavyweight cham-
pion of the world. The subsequent
massacre of my ambitious cobber in the
first draw of the local tourney put a dent
in my own self-confidence that has never
completely grown out. Where did the
“Danube Waves” come in? Well, with
no third person to hold the clock we had
to time the rounds somehow; and the
only three-minute record we had was
“Danube Waves.”

“Findy”; An English murderer, under
sentence of death for killing his wife, was
reprieved from the gallows last week on
the grounds that he “could not be hanged
without suffering extreme physical
agony.” After shooting his wife he had
put a bullet through his own jaw. The
decision offers great hope to all unhappy
benedicts who feel that a prison sentence
would not be too great a price to pay for
freedom, but it also irresistibly recalls
the end of Robespierre. The “Incorrup-
tible” had his jaw broken by a bullet;
some accounts say he himself fired the
shot, others that a young gendarme
named Meda, later to become a general
and a baron, put the slug in him. Either
way, it did not save him from the guil-
lotine. Carlyle, who witnessed the cere-
mony in spirit some 40 years later, speaks
of
the mangled jaw bound up rudely with
bloody linen; a spectacle to men....At
the foot of the scaffold they stretched him
on the ground till his turn came. Lifted
aloft, his eyes again opened; caught the
bloody axe. Samson wrenched the coat
off him; wrenched the dirty linen from his
jaw; the jaw fell powerless, there burst
from him a cry—hideous to hear and see.
Getting back to the English killer, it
seems a little illogical that through
botching an attempt at suicide —in itself
a crime—he should win a reprieve. Pre-
sumably if he hadn’t tried to suicide he
would have been hanged.

“Jemac”: Nelson going home pickled
in a cask of rare brandy (Red Page,

the best 0.-p. traditions of the R.N. But
in Nelson’s day, though naval officers,
particularly bosuns, gunners and others
promoted from the lower-deck, enjoyed
their rum tots, some of the finest liqueurs
in Europe were to be found in men-of-
war’s wardrooms —Dutch, French and
Spanish prizes offered'ample opportunity
for replenishment. It is inconceivable
that Nelson’s body should be preserved in
any but the finest fluid, hence the choice
of brandy over rum. 1

“Ex-C.G.”: Though born in Melbourne
and living there many years, I never en-
countered this so-called Sydney-Mel-

since when I’ve had to endure much. But
at last I am avenged. At a Sydney
Eastern Suburbs party a visiting Vic-
torian was introduced. “Ah,” said the
usual funny man, “I suppose you miss
the Footscray smell over here.” “In the

disarming grin, “Footscray doesn’t smell;
in the second place I have just come past
Rose Bay at low tide. Boy, we’ve got

Has borne as much as he can undergo
Of something that would tax the stoutest nerves.

Contemptuous defiance? Queensland’s “had”

fOn the ’2lst November,
1783, In a field near Paris,
occurred an event that
was destined to have far-
reaching effects on
modern aviation.
Jean de Rozier made the
first ascent in a free
balloon and, by staying
aloft for 25 minutes and
steering a course for 5
miles, actually paved the
way for aerial navigation
as we know it to-day
—a hundred years before this historic event —
was already established as the world’s leading

remained unchallenged until the present day.

TO ARCHITECTS, CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERS
AND BUILDING OWNERS
In one respect the Melbourne skyline is no different to that
of any other Australian metropolis—the principal buildings
seen against the sky are equipped with Waygood-Otis Lifts.
Offices, department stores, hospitals and flats—each type of
building presents its own internal traffic problem due to its
location, its design and its use. Architects, construction
engineers and building owners often call upon Waygood-Otis
for constructive advice and assistance in selecting the right
design of installation to meet both service conditions and
budget limitations. This invitation is extended to you—without
obligation.

Our Bewildering Policy
“Ek Dum”; Chiang Kai-shek,
resigning from the Chinese Presi-
dency after five years of office,
has made the position of the
National Government clear,
however he may try to cloak the
disaster. He admits that the
Nationalists have lost seven
armies in Manchuria, including
his American-trained and -armed
First and Sixth, within the past
year. A Chinese “Army” at full
strength means “corps” in any
other language—three divisions
each of about 14,000 men.
It is apparent that the policy
of trying to fight it out in be-
sieged areas in Manchuria has
been abandoned. Manchuria is
lost to the Russian-armed and
-trained Communists. Fighting
will begin anew with the arrival
of spring. The Nationalists,
despite their courageous show of
confidence, will have their work
cut out to save Central and
North China.
Communists are working like
beavers to oust British and
Americans altogether from
Shanghai and Hong Kong.
North Korea is virtually a Rus-
sian province. Every possible
step is being taken to destroy
United States control in southern
Korea, the Australian delegate
giving a little aid. It seems that
in this northern summer war
will be open and critical along
the very frontiers of Australia’s
own zones of interest —along the
coasts washed by the waters
which our Navy patrols, almost
within sight of Japan, where we
have a military force whose
morals are now being examined
by an ex-adjutant-general, some
clergy and a newspaper reporter,
as emissaries of the unfortunate
Minister for Forceps.
The Australian Government
is in its usual state of confusion.
At the beginning of the week
the Munitions Department was
virtually abolished and merged
into the Department of Supply
—apparently Senator Arm-
strong’s social duties do not
allow him time to look after
such minor matters —and the
selection of a new Minister at
the present time would generate
such emotions and divisions in-
side Caucus that the Prime
Minister is not prepared to take
the risk.
On April 4, M. J. D. L. Hood,
the “Excellency” who directly
represents Dr. Evatt, and acts
as his Minister-spokesman in
U.N.0., returned from abroad to
Sydney, and, as reported in the
“S. M. Herald,” said that “much
of America’s war talk was ill-
informed and not assisting the
work of U.N.0.”
On the same day, according
to the “S. M. Herald,” Mr.
Hood’s redoubtable chief, Dr.
Evatt, was reported to have
said in a New York newspaper
that “delay in the Pacific peace
settlement until the German
treaty has been concluded could
mean disaster for the world”:
Under United States leadership,
Australia is prepared to accept a due
share of the burdens and responsibility
of maintaining peace and contributing
to raising the standards of human
welfare throughout the Pacific.
Three days later Dr. Evatt was
negativing both his own
Minister’s feelings about war
talk and his plans with the
United States:
We have today not peace, but a
situation of pretended peace.... The
falling-out between the Powers, and
especially between the Soviet Union
and the United States, is a tragedy.
There is a drift towards war. Con-
siderations of power politics are domi-
nating the just settlement of many
problems.
He added that it would be an
evil day for Australia if Japan
were allowed to have the
capacity to rearm. The last
sentence is an echo of recent
Moscow propaganda which
works for a defenceless Japan,
not for the protection of Aus-
tralia and the United States, but
in promotion of the imperialist
ambitions of Russia. In the
United States the feeling is that
if matters go on as at present it
may become necessary to arm
Japan, under Allied supervision,
to save it from a Russian in-
vasion. Dr. Evatt’s propaganda
in this matter is in line with
Moscow’s, and so is his insistent
demand for a trade-union demo-
cracy in Japan—a demand which
originated in the big Communist
trade-unions in Australia, and
about which only the Australian
Communist-intimidated Govern-
ment and the Moscow Govern-
ment are enthusiastic. As in
Korea, Dr. Evatt is at logger-
heads with the Ai,niericans over
Japanese policy, both industrial
and defence.
In contrast to his statement
published on April 4 in New
York, in which he expresse ; d
Australia’s (i.e., Evatt’s) willing-
ness to carry out a Pacific policy
“under American leadership,”
his objectives on April 8 were:
To maintain and strengthen ties
with Britain and the Dominions. To
strengthen Pacific security by appro-
priate regional arrangements in co-
operation with the United States and
other Pacific nations.
That, in . direct contradiction
of his aspirations to be led by
the United States and strengthen
ties with Britain, he is actually
being influenced to some extent
by Russian views is further
shown by his remark in ex-
pounding the situation to Parlia-
ment :
Less than three years ago the
United States, the British Common-
wealth and the Soviet Union were
fighting together in a spirit of com-
radeship .... In my opinion it will be
a disgrace for all who were allies in
the war if something cannot be done
to recapture that spirit of three years
ago, so that the peoples of the world
can have some freedom from fear
of war.
Dr. Evatt was Foreign
Minister threg years ago. He
knows that the alliance in being
at that time was one of necessity
and expediency. He knows that
the Russians were taking every-
thing supplies, information,
war secrets, liberty to spread
Communism in British countries,
while conceding no'thing what-
ever, and not even allowing
Allied liaison-officers to go to
the Russian front. He knows that
they were behaving like surly
savages to the Royal Navy at
Murmansk.
He knows that Russia and its
agents were using the second-
front propaganda everywhere as
a revolutionary weapon against
the Governments of its allies, in-
cluding Australia. He knows
that Stalin blackmailed the
Allies into not landing in the
Balkans in 1944 when such a
landing would have saved hun-
dreds of thousands of lives and
shortened the war by months.
He knows that Tito’s dealings
with the Allies were treachery
from end to end. He knows that
Russia blackmailed the Allies
into handing over Berlin and
Czechoslovakia —American and
British troops were held back
from Berlin, and Americans
were actually in Prague when
Russia demanded the right to
make a glorious conquest of
these already-conquered places.
He knows also the full story
of the little Baltic countries, of
the rape of Manchuria, of breach
after breach of agreement, of the
gradual capture by “cold war”
of all Eastern Europe, which is
being incorporated into the
Russian empire. He knows, if
he has read the royal-commis-
sion report, that three years ago
Russia was involved in a foul
conspiracy of espionage, sabot-
age, passport-forgery and cor-
ruption in Canada.
And yet he had the impudence
to tell Parliament and the Aus-
tralian people that it would be
a disgrace to all who were allies

His voice is tne voice or tne
unions which keep him in office,
It was typical of the state of
the Government that the day
after he spoke the Minister for
Defence, Mr. Dedman, pooh-
poohed the danger of war and
belittled the United Kingdom,
with which Dr. Evatt aims “to
maintain and strengthen ties.”
Parliament might demand an
inquiry into Our Foreign Policy,
Dr. Evatt’s statements are not
the logical product of facts,
His viewpoint is unique among
the viewpoints of the Foreign
Ministers of the British
Dominions; and is not likely to
maintain and strengthen our ties
with Britain and the Dominions,
But it is a quite consistent view-
point for a Ministry which has
consented to provide £500,000-
worth of wool for Eastern
Europe. Most of it will be used
to keep the Red Guards warm.
Does Russia Want
War?
“Ek Dum”: If the Federal
Attorney-General is sincerely
satisfied that there is no possi-
bility of espionage in Australia
by Soviet officialdom he is
simpler than he looks ; or else
he has not read the Report of
the Canadian Royal Commis-
sion on Espionage—espionage
carried on in 1945 when Dr.
Evatt says that the Western
Allies were all good companions.
The principal witness at the
Canadian inquiry, Gouzenko, the
Russian cipher clerk, said
that during the year that he
spent in special training at the
Main Intelligence H.Q. of the
Red Army in Moscow he saw in
course of his work “a large
number of telegrams to and from
many countries, detailing opera-
tions there similar to those
which he has disclosed in
Canada.”
The Commission placed it be-
yond doubt that the espionage
was not casual:
The seUup of this organisation in
Canada is the result of a long pre-
paration by trained and experienced
men, who have come here for the
express purpose of carrying on spy-
ing activities and who have employed
all the resources at their disposal,
with or without corruption, to fulfil
the tasks assigned to them.. Some of
these men undoubtedly have been well
schooled in espionage and fifth-
column organisational methods, and
in political and psychological “de-
velopment” techniques.
Training in Moscow
It was proved that as early as
1924 there was an organisation
at work in Canada directed
from Russia and operating with
Communist sympathisers, among
whom two of the most promi-
nent are now in jail—Fred Rose,
born Rosenberg, of Lublin,
Poland, who was in the
Canadian Parliament wh e n
arrested, and Sam Carr, born
Kogen or Cohen, in Pomachpol,
Russian Ukraine. The latter
took a course at the Lenin
school in Moscow—as have a
number of the officials of the
Communist party of Australia,
including its chief administrative
officer. At that school, the Royal
Commission declares, “the mat-
ters taught included political
subjects, and also such practical
subjects as the organisation of
political movements, fomenta-
tion or extension or prolonga-
tion of strikes for ulterior pur-
poses, sabotage methods, espion-
age and barricade-fighting. The
students received a good educa-
tion as ‘agents-conspirators.’ ”
A Widespread System
Early in 1943 the organisa-
tion was taken over by Colonel
Zabotin. Before Zabotin took
over there were no fewer than
four groups working under the
superintendence of Fred Rose,
the Canadian M.P. Later there
were “several parallel under-
cover systems or networks
operating in closed compart-
ments.” Gouzenko said:
The Soviet Government was trying
to establish a fifth-column in Canada.
What transpired is only a modest
small part of all that is really here.
You may have discovered fifteen men,
but it still leaves in Canada this dan-
gerous situation because there are
other societies and other people work-
ing under every Embassy, under every
Consul in each place where there
is a consulate. It is like a number
of small circles. There are, parallel
systems of spies and potential agents.
The last telegram asked about the
mobilisation of resources in Canada.
They wanted to know everything pos-
sible about everything concerned in
Canada. They wanted to know the
natural resources that Canada could
mobilise in case of \^ar —her coal, oil,
rare metals and so on.
The Royal Commission
learned that apart from the spy-
ring . which they flushed there
was also a special Soviet mili-
tary intelligence ring, a techni-
cal ring and the N.K.V.D. at
work in the. Dominion:
There can be little doubt that the
N. previously called the
O. and which is the secret
political police of the Soviet Union,
have a powerful organisation in
Canada.
Embassy and Party
The connection between the
Soviet Embassy and the Central
Committee of the Commdnist
party also was established be-
yond doubt. The medium in
Canada was Second
Secretary of the Embassy, who
had “been an assistant to Malen-
kov, head of the foreign sec-
tion of the Central Committee of
the Communist Party of the
Soviet Union in Moscow.”
Gouzenko swore he “had seen
Goussarov working at the Cen-
tral Committee offices in Mos-
cow in 1942.” He stated regard-
ihg Goussarov’s operations in
Canada: —
Officially he was supposed to be
working in the Textile Institute, as
I read in a Canadian magazine. Then
he came to Canada. Goussarov is
only the Second Secretary, but obvi-
ously his authority is on the level of
the Ambassador. He has direct con-
tact with the Central Committee of
the Communist party. He is a party
organiser in the Embassy,
Gouzenko asserted that Soviet
diplomats were often supplied
with false biographies by their
Government.
Apart from* supervising the
Communist cell in the Embassy,
Gouzenko testified that he had
reason to believe that Goussarov
had the task of “submitting
political directives from his
superiors in Moscow to the
leaders of the Canadian Com-
munist movement.” These direc-
tives would include “instruc-
tions on techniques of opera-
tion.” He said;
Examples of the latter would be
the instructions to create or to get
control of functional organisations
such as the Canadian Association of
Scientific Workers; to occupy im-
portant positions in the labor unions,
when necessary for special purposes,
to instruct certain Canadian secret
Communists to take up temporarily
an anti-Communist line; to get mem-
bers into controlling positions in the
executives of youth movements, in-
ternational friendship councils, etc.,
which could be important from a
propaganda point of view.
Spies
Gouzenko wrote in a state-
ment which he made on October
10, 1945:
To many Soviet people abroad it
is clear that the Communist party in
democratic countries has changed long
ago from a political party into an
agency net of the Soviet Government,
into a fifth-column in these countries
to meet a war, into an instrument in
the hands of the Soviet Government
for creating unrest, provocations, etc.
And despite the Federal Goy-
ernment’s protestations to the
contrary, much the same condi-
tions must exist in Australia.
There is no doubt that the Com-
munist party was formed here
by Moscow agencies; that its
policy was framed by Moscow
agencies ; that it was introduced
and set working in one case by
a body of which the chairman at
the time was a man who became
one of Mr. Chifley’s own Minis-
ters, and its secretary Mr. Gar-
den, Mr. Ward’s henchman.
The C.S.I.R.
During the debate in Parlia-
ment on Communism last week
the idea was scoffed at that there
might be any danger of Com-
munist infiltration into the
C.S.I.R. But the Canadian Com-
mission reported regarding that
concern’s opposite number in
Canada; —
A good illustration of the ease with
which the Soyiet Government was
able to obtain espionage agents from
the secret membership of the Com-
munist party in selected Canadian
organisations is provided by the Re-
search Group Two of the three
scientists were members of a Com-
munist cell made up of scientists,
most of whom were employed in the
National Research Council in Ottawa.
This cell was transformed on
the instructions from Moscow
into “an active espionage organ-
isation working against Canada
on behalf of a foreign Power.”
In the C.S.I.R. there is one
scientist, convicted during the
last war of espionage for the
Communist party, imprisoned,
interned, a propagandist against
current defence methods —one
who believes that the British lion
is “a jackal.” Mr. Chifley and
Dr. Evatt are content to leave
him where he is.
Preparing for War
Gouzenko, in his sworn
declaration, said of Russian
methods: — „
Holding forth at international con-
ferences with voluble statements"
about peace and security, the Soviet
Government is simultaneously pre-
paring secretly for *a third world war.
To meet this war, the Soviet Govern-
ment is creating in democratic coun-
tries, including Canada, a fifth-column
in the organisation of which even
diplomatic representatives of the
Soviet Government take part.
Gouzenko testified that
Colonel Zabotin advised a
gathering of Soviet officials fti
the Embassy on September 5,
1945, just after the Japanese war
ended: —
Yesterday [Britain, U.S., etc*) were
allies, today they are neighbors, to-
morrow they will be our enemies.
“It is all done,” said Gou-
zenko, “to train the people to
think that they must fight
another war, that it may be the
final war... .in which the capi-
talist countries are doomed to
defeat and will be destroyed by
force and replaced by Commun-
ism.”
This is exactly in line with th’e
speech of Stalin’s made oft
November 7, 1939, and pub-
lished verbatim in the “Aus-
tralian Communist” the follow-
ing month.

PERSONAL ITEMS
In 1919 Sir William Robertson, who,
after being the first officer risen from the
ranks to pass through the Staff College,
held the onerous job of Chief of the
Imperial General Staff during the middle
years of World War I, was in charge of
British occupation forces on the Rhine.
Today his son, as Military Governor of
the British zone, is in Berlin holding
up Britain’s end in the storm-centre of
the cold war. Sir Brian Robertson was
a youngster when the First War broke
out; by the time it finished he had
picked up a D.S.O. and an M.C. He took
part in the Waziristan expedition in 1922
and retired from the Army in 1933 to
enter business. Called back early in
Hitler’s war, he served in the Middle
East and became Chief Administrative
Officer to General Alexander during the
Italian campaign. If appealed to at the
present time he would probably say that
the task of fighting an enemy up the
backbone of Italy was plain sailing com-
pared with that of following the twists
and turns of tortuous Soviet diplomacy.
In Melbourne on loan to the Atlas
Supply Co., the American concern which
is using a Skymaster as a display window
on a' world tour, Ivan Smirnoff
hit the headlines in the days of the Java
turmoil. Leaving Java with eight pas-
sengers, a crew of four and a cargo of
diamonds worth £200,000, Smirnoff made
for Australia. He got to Broome just as
the Japs had set it ablaze in an air-raid,
and he crash-landed in the surf with four
of his complement, including a mother
and baby, killed by Jap bullets. He buried
his dead, sent some of his passengers for
aid and then searched for the diamonds.
Eight days later the party was rescued
by blacks from a mission-station, but it
wasn’t till some months later that a beach-
comber stumbled on the diamonds. The
Russian airman flew for Russia in World
War I, then joined Dutch Airlines. He
has 2,000,000 miles and 28,000 flying
hours to his credit.
Since the success of Harold Stassen at
the Wisconsin primary election, know-
ledgeable correspondents have discovered
him as a “new” possibility for the Re-
publican nomination for U.S. President.
There’s nothing new about his chance ;
he was being spoken of as a hot tip
shortly after Roosevelt began his fourth
term. Three times Governor of Minne-
sota, he stepped down in 1943 to join
the Navy, served in the Pacific and was
recalled by Roosevelt as a delegate to the
San Francisco Conference. It was then
suggested that the wily F.D.R. was put-
ting a possible future opponent on the
spot, but Stassen played a first-rate hand
at ’Frisco and enhanced his reputation for
shrewdness and diplomacy. Since the
end of the war his role has been that of
a behind-the-scenes man. He was ex-
pected to run for the Senate in 1946,
but instead campaigned for E. J. Thye,
his successor as Governor of Minnesota,
and was successful in getting him elected
over isolationist Senator Shipstead, who
had opposed the setting-up of U.N.O. and
also the loan to Britain. Minnesota’s
other Senator, Joseph Bali, was nominated
by Stassen when Governor in 1940 ; com-
pletely new to politics, he retained the
seat at a subsequent election. There’s a
big gulf between winning a Wisconsin
primary and getting the Republican nomi-
nation at the National Convention, but
Stassen is on the way.
Raymond Cottam Allsop, F.I.R.E.
(Aust.), F.S.M.P.E., 5.M.1.R.E., as one
might hazard, is an engineer of some
kind; actually a radio and “talkie” en-
gineer—he has been mixed up in radio
since he was 11. Now 49, Allsop stands
on the threshold of the television and
frequency-modulation era in Australia
rubbing shoulders with knight Ernest Fisk,
with whom he is associated in the Aus-
tralian activities of Electrical and Musical
Industries, Ltd. Like Fisk, Allsop was a
pioneer of the ether. He joined the
R.A.N. in World War I at the age of 16
as wireless-operator, and saw plenty of
active service. At 25 he was chief en-
gineer of the Commonwealth’s first
broadcasting station. When talkies came
he was in on that, developing a synchro-
nised sound system of his own; and in
World War II was quickly found a job
in the Navy doing hush-hush work in an
anti-submarine school. Allsop recently
visited the United Kingdom, where tele-
vision—-“the greatest scientific marvel
since the wheel was invented” is techm-
cally far more advanced than in the
United States.
Two new bishops have, been appointed
t Q the Roman Catholic hierarchy in New
South Wales—John Doody becomes
Bishop of Armidale and Eris O’Brien
Auxiliary-Bishop of Sydney. Dr. Doody
was b orn in Brisbane and studied for the
priesthood at St. Patrick’s College,
Manly. Ordained in the Basilica of St.
j 0 h n Lateran, in Rome, 21 years ago,
has since been stationed in his home
state, first at Ipswich, later as secretary
to Archbishop Duhig and inspector of
Catholic schools. For the past 12 years
he has been parish-priest at Nambour.
Bishop O’Brien has been parish-priest at
Neutral Bay, Sydney, and is lecturer in
Australian History at Sydney University,
From 1930-34 he held a similar post in
Modern History at St. John’s College,
Sydney, and he has a formidable stritig
of letters after his name. He’s a Master
of Arts of Sydney and of the National
University of Ireland, a Doctor of Philo-
sophy of Louvain University and a Fellow
of both the Royal Historical and the
Royal Geographical Societies,
“C. 8,”: Dr. Vender, of Fiji (B.
24/3/’4B), once had to entertain an official
h e didn’t care for. He had a lot of
white fowls, and his native servants had
a knowledge of dyes which they extracted
from plants in his so he told
them to exercise their artistic imagina-
tions by dyeing the chooks any color
their taste dictated. After plying his
guest with food and drink he invited him
to enjoy the tropical evening on the
bungalow verandah. Suddenly the
official dropped his voice to a whisper
an( j sa i(f: “Excuse me, Vernier. There
ma y be something wrong with my eye-
sight, but tell me, are those green fowls
I see pecking in your garden?” “Where?”
said Vender. “Over there,” said the
official. “Oh, there,” said Vender,
“They’re just ordinary chooks.” The
official decided not to stay the night and
got away half an hour later,
Knight Joshua Ross-Taylor, caught by
j uc jgi n g Aberdeen-Angus steak at

spiration will be permanently affected.
Harrington was born at Shepparton (Vic.)
and spent his boyhood at Colbinabbin,
where his father had taken up land when
the property of Melba’s father, David
Mitchell, was subdivided. Later the
family tried their luck in the Mallee,
and it'was his experience of the heart-
breaking work of clearing scrub and try-
ing to farm sandhills that prompted
Harrington’s first Bulletin verses, “A
Cry from the Mallee.” That was in the
early 1920’5, and Harrington still speaks
gratefully of the help and encouragement
given him by Andree Hayward, then
handling Bulletin verse. Harrington
was not much more than a youngster
when he left Australia with reinforce-
ments for the Fourth Light Horse; he
took part in the historic charge in Beer-
sheba. After the war he leamt the
plastering trade, which he followed for
many years, but since 1940 he has been
working with the Department of Aircraft
Production at Fishermen’s Bend. He has
published two books of verse. Boundary
Ben and The Kerrigan Boys. His “Cats
on the Roof,” published in the Christmas
Number, 1934, is more frequently asked
for than any other Bulletin verses.
A medal struck this year for Australian
agricultural science by the Australian
institute of the science makes its initial
appearance on the lapel, or wherever pro-
fessors wear such gauds, of Professor
S. M. Wadham, Dean of the Faculty at
the University of Melbourne. The pro-
fessor has been an indefatigable research-
worker and a member of public commit-
tees. He was a member of the Common-
wealth Dairying Investigation, the Wheat
Commission and the Commonwealth
Advisory Council on Nutrition. He is a
voluminous writer on his subject. During
World War I he served in Palestine and
Syria in the U.K. forces. He was bom
at Ealing, London, in 1891.
Spero Defteros, Victorian amateur
heavyweight wrestling champion, is tak-
ing a holiday from his business as a
fruiterer to prepare himself for the
Olympic Games. Born at Ithaca, Greece,
'he came to Melbourne in 1934. Backed
by the Melbourne Greek community,
Spero sent his wrestling record to the
Greek Olympic Committee. He has now
been nominated and will join the Greek
team in London.
Commander of Flinders Naval Depot,
G. G. O. Gatacre, D.S.C. and Bar,
R.A.N., must find the responsibility of
training raw recruits a far cry from act-
ing as squadron navigating officer of
battleship Rodney when she helped pound
Bismarck to the bottom, but the job
today is of first-class importance. Gat-
acre was in Flinders as a boy in 1921 ;
he was promoted commander 20 years
later. He has served with the R.N. in
battlers Renown and Rodney, has been
operations staff officer to the rear-
admiral commanding the Australian
squadron, in both Shropshire and Aus-
tralia, worked on a staff job at Navy
Office, and has held one of the most
coveted appointments in the Navy—com-
mand of a modern Fleet destroyer. From
Arunta he landed in F.N.D. His D.S.C,
was won in the Atlantic; its bar in the
Solomons.
John Bowie Wilson, V.D.,
8.E., K.C., has passed on in Sydney at
73. From Sydney Grammar he took
to mine-engineering, in which he
won his B.E. at Sydney University
in 1897; and he worked at Mount
Morgan for the next 10 years, the
last two as mine manager. For
a few years after that he combined
a practice as consulting mining-engineer
With a lectureship at Sydney Uni., at the
same time studying for the bar; he was
admitted in 1914. While at Mount
Morgan he joined the Queensland
Mounted Infantry and was commissioned
in its Second Battalion. His work
in the Army legal department in 1914-18
won him recognition for “specially meri-
torious service.” He became Judge
Advocate-General in 1935, and in that
post throughout the late war performed
service in systematising the legal side of
the Array’s administration. Impeccably
just and upright in his own character,
Bowie Wilson asserted, even against
the Commander-in-Chief, the principles
he believed in as necessary for the wel-
fare of the service, leaving a tradition
therein which will be his sure memorial.
Ronald Drayton Brown has won the
Masson Memorial Scholarship for 1948,
awarded by the Australian Chemical In-
stitute. In his B.Sc ± course at Melbourne
Uni. he obtained honors in chemistry
each year. In his final year, 1946, he
shared the Dixon scholarships in chemis-
try 111 and IV and also the Cuming
major and minor scholarships. He will
undertake research work in Melbourne
under Dr. F. N. Lahey and also visit
Sydney University to learn certain tech-
niques from Professor Le Fevre.
Dead in Sydney at 77, George Lyndon
Carpenter, fifth general of the Salvation
Army, Born at Raymond Terrace, near
Newcastle (N.S.W.), he was apprenticed to
the printing trade, but became interested
in the “Army” and was admitted to its
training college in Melbourne in 1892.
Forty-seven years later he succeeded
Evangeline Booth as head of the organi-
sation, after a career which had taken
him to most countries of the world and
had familiarised him with all branches
of S.A. activity. His early experience
in the composing-room was not wasted;
for five years he was overseer at the
Army’s printing works. Later he acted
as secretary to Bramwell Booth, son of
the founder and second general of the
Army. General Carpenter resigned
through ill-health two years ago and had
lived in Australia since his retirement.
Into the Silence:

Women's letters
From Melbourne
The Victor Steibel gowns worn by
Eileen Joyce at her first recital were
greatly admired. For the first half of the
concert, when Schubert and Chopin were
the composers chosen, the pianist wore
a gleaming white taffeta gown fashioned
with a bouffant skirt and a bodice with
a deep square neckline and full puff
sleeves. The front and back of the bodice
and the band of the sleeves were trimmed
with coin-size gold sequins. For the
second half, when Eileen chose to inter-
pret some modern composers, she changed
to an ice-blue taffeta gown, wired at the
hips to make the skirt more bouffant,
and over the bodice she wore a short
bolero of the taffeta, which glistened with
clusters of rose-pink sequins.
Lady Dugan was in the audience, her
long, slim-fitting gown of black crepe
under a silver-fox cape. She was accom-
panied by Penelope Nettlefold, in black
gown and hip-length jacket of mist-blue
wool. Mrs. Bernard Heinze’s floral tunic
of wine-toned flowers on a white ground
was allied with a long slim-fitting skirt.
Ice-blue crepes and a black Persian-lamb
coat were Mrs. Arthur Wenzel’s choice.
Her daughter, Mrs. Geoff Cohen, made
her dove-grey satin brocade gown more
striking with a bustle skirt. Mrs. Frank
Tait chose a black-beaded gown ; Eileen
Brennan’s short dinner frock of black
crepe had a deep V-shaped front of fine
beige lace. Mrs. Guy Bakewell’s paisley-
patterned frock was worn with a halo of
rose-pink and green ribbon and clustered
with flowers in the same tonings. Viva
Holgate Clarke, who begins a season of
lunch-hour piano recitals in the Assembly
Hall on Friday, chose a floral evening
gown. A short matching jacket topped
Vi Dunn’s black-crepe gown. Margaret
Saker’s ensemble was of ice-blue crepe,
her small hat of black ostrich feathers.
Great interest was aroused when the
engagement of Lord Mayor Raymond
Connelly was announced. The girl he
will marry is Patricia Holschier, third
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. C. A. Hol-
schier, of Woondoota, N.S.W. She was
educated at the Brigidine Convent,
Echuca, and at Genazzano, Kew. Five
years ago Patricia completed her train-
ing at St. Vincent’s Hospital, and since
that time has been nursing at Mount St.
Evins. Patricia is a petite brunette with
large hazel eyes and is fond of sport,
particularly tennis and riding. The date
and place of the wedding have not been
fixed, but it will be very quiet. The Lord
Mayor, whose term of office expires in
August, wiU sail for England with his
bride in June. The engagement ring is
a large, square-cut sapphire with a dia-
mond on each side.
Thirty-one pretty debutantes in white
frocks, with tiny white ostrich-plumes in
their hair and carrying red, white and
blue flower posies, made their formal
bow to the Governor, Sir Winston Dugan,
and Lady Dugan, at the Catholic Welfare
Organisation’s naval ball in the St. Kilda
Town Hall. Many of the debs, were
squired by naval ratings in uniform, and
they were presented to the Governor and
Lady Dugan by Mrs. Lionel Lockwood,
wife of Surgeon-Captain Lockwood, of
Flinders Naval Depot. A large floral
model of H.M.A.S. Australia “flying” the
admiral’s pennant decorated the official
table. There was also a floral model
of Nelson’s ship Trafalgar. Lady Dugan,
in a hyacinth-blue and silver-lame gown,
was received by Mrs. J. J. Daly, presi-
dent of C.W.0., whose black-crepe gown
featured an ice-blue, gold-trimmed yoke.
Mrs. A. A. Lord was gowned in royal-
blue satin with a motif of copper-toned
sequins set at one side of the bodice.
The Governor’s sister, Mrs. J. O. Hasel-
den, wore a floral gown in which deep-
mauve flowers were patterned on
white satin. Penelope Nettlefold wore a
filmy gown of deep rose-pink tulle
fashioned with a fichu shoulder-line.
Mrs. George Jones, who was with her
Air-Marshal husband, was in a slim-fitting
white-crepe gown and hip-length jacket
lavishly trimmed with gold sequins.
Rear-Admiral John Collins was without
his wife, who is unfortunately ill in hos-
pital. With Colonel Hester, U.S. Military
Attache, was Mrs. Hester, whose olive-
green-crepe frock was highlighted with
brilliant gold ornamentation on the
sleeves and bodice of the hip-length tunic
top. Mrs. Stephen Jurika, wife of the
U.S. Naval Attache, wore an unusual
gown of black crepe, banded with white
broderie Anglaise. Mrs. Showers, wife of
Commodore A. H. Showers, R.A.N., ;
wore pastel-pink chiffons. Mrs. H. J.
Buchanan’s slim-fitting white-crepe gown :
had the skirt slit at the side-seams; a
pink-and-white-corded bolero was worn
over the bodice. Mrs. Harold Wootton ]
chose a black gown with diamond jewel-
lery. Mrs. Newman Morris was also
in a black gown ; her hip-length cape was
of white ermine. Mrs. S. Delahenty
wore a filmy-white-chiffon gown.
Ambition overruled the judgment of
the producer of the National Theatre’s
presentation of “Carmen”; compared
with the good work done in other works
this opera was marred by bad stagecraft,
make-up and dressing. The gala opening
was well attended. Lovely furs were
worn by Mrs. Frank Tait with her black
dinner-gown. Joy Beattie’s ice-blue crepe
gown trimmed with glittering sequins was
worn with a hip-length white ermine cape.
Mrs. Carl Randall wore a black Persian-
lamb coat over her frock of black-
and ice - blue - striped taffeta. Mrs.
Frank Worthington wore silver foxes
with her black gown. Mrs. John Shef-
field’s sweeping black-velvet cape was
very modish; Mrs. Eva Hayes wore a
three-quarter-length silver-fox coat over
her long black dinner frock. Mrs. Claude
Fleming chose a cyclamen crepe shirt-
maker style dinner frock with a hip-
length ice-blue-knitted coat. Gertrude
Johnson’s black gown was worn with a
waist-length white-ermine cape. Madame
Grace Angelau in short black dinner
frock and silver-fox cape-coat was with
Mrs. Desmond Kennedy, who also chose
a black frock and fur cape.
Dorothy Ellen, second daughter of Dr.
and Mrs. H. V. Mattingley, of Camber-
well, has just announced her engagement
*to John David, younger son of Mr.
Andrew Rutherford, of Brighton, and
the late Mrs. Rutherford. Dorothy is
well-known in this city’s musical circles,
and has been on the teaching staff of
Sacre Coeur Convent and Little St.
Margaret’s for some years. Dorothy won
an exhibition, which she did not accept,
at the Albert-street Conservatorium. In-
stead she went to the University Conser-
vatorium, where she did a brilliant
course, winning an Ormond Exhibition
and the Diploma of Music as a solo per-
former and the Degree of Bachelor of
Music as a teacher. Her fiance saw
action with the A.I.F. in the Middle East.
They plan to marry on May 8 at St.
Mark’s, Camberwell. Athol Shmith

Seventy-four women were among
graduates presented to the Chancellor of
the University, Sir Charles Lowe, at the
conferring of degrees in Wilson Hall.
The many-colored hoods worn by mem-
bers of the academic staff, and profes-
sorial board and emeritus professors, were
a blaze of color. For the first time a
woman, Erica Charlotte Wolff, gradu-
ated as Doctor of Philosophy; Nancy
Millis graduated as Master of Agricul-
tural Science. Nancy, with Mary Eggles-
ton, a former graduate in Agricultural
Science, will leave soon for Sydney, where
they will do a course in Pacific Adminis-
tration and will then leave for New
Guinea to work as district agricultural
officers with headquarters at Port
Moresby. Shirley, daughter of Prof.
George Browne, who took out her Arts
degree, will marry Colin Baldwin on
May 29 at St. John’s, Melbourne.
At afternoon-tea, which followed, Lady
Lowe wore an aqua-blue frock under a
beech-brown coat; blue wings trimmed
her small brown hat. Mrs. J. D. G.
Medley, wife of the Vice-Chancellor,
wore a tailored frock of black crepe ;
her small black hat was relieved by small
white feather wings. Her daughter
Diana chose a jacket suit of ice-blue linen
and halo of navy straw. Mrs. Warner,
wife of the Minister of Housing, repeated
the cinnamon-brown tone of her outfit
in her hat. Mrs. A. E. Coates’s black
Persian-lamb coat and black frock were
worn with a large flat beret of sage-green
felt.
From Sydney
There was classic grace in the design
and draping of Erna Berger’s gold lame
concert frock. The rather long bodice
was outlined in gold leaves from which
the full skirt flowed in gracious ripples
to form a pool of gold around the singer’s
feet. Erna’s coloratura came round and
firm in the two Mozart arias allotted to
her, and the orchestra, directed by Eugene
Goossens, did not clamor challenge to
the voice, but wove a pattern of sound
on which the voice was the arabesque.
The Town Hall was surging with a sub-
scribers’ first-night audience, for this was
the first symphony orchestral concert of
1948.
All were in their accustomed seats.
Mrs. Walter Swinson, back again after
her illness, sustained a barrage of con-
gratulations on her recovery. Mrs.
Fawsitt was there with her professor hus-
band. Mrs. Woodward and pretty and
musical daughter Marie were up in front.
Lily Kolos and Gladys Verona were
glimpsed. A Jacquard Coronation scarf
formed the bodice of Margaret Gillespie’s
dinner-frock; the skirt was of hyacinth-
blue crepe. With her were Mrs. Muriel
Henty and Mrs. Selby, with whom the
singer is staying on the North Shore line.
They and Erna had all driven in to the
Town Hall together. Mrs. Charles Lloyd
Jones’s platina foxes warmed buoyant
grey chiffons. Mrs. Eric Blaski, pianist
Enith Clarke —being complimented on
her own recital the night before —Miss
Jobson and Miss Wilson, and great music-
lover Dame Constance D’Arcy gave
applause.
Erna Berger, who met her first Aus-
tralian concert audience last Thursday,
arrived with London and European
honors fresh upon her. Erna is principal
coloratura soprano of the Berlin State
Opera. Before World War II and since
she has sung leading soprano parts in
London. Before the war she sang opera
under Sir Thomas Beecham’s leadership,
singing in “Don Pasquale” and “The
Barber of Seville.’' She was also Queen
of Night in “The Magic Flute” and
Marcelline in “Fidelio.” In July, after
her return from her Australian tour, she
will record operatic arias in association
with Beecham. Mozart’s “Seraglio” is
among the chosen works. After that
Erna goes, the whole four-foot-ten of her
(she is even smaller than Lily Pons), to
the Salzburg Festival,
There is an underlying savagery in
“Sailor’s Return,” based on the David
Garnett story. And the savagery does not
emanate from Tulip, the island princess
brought back by her sailor husband to a
life in rural England over a century ago.
This ballet was introduced at the
Tivoli on Saturday night. Sally
Gilmour’s chocolate make-up is per-
fection, intensified by the reds and yellows
of the frocks she wears as the sailor’s gay
young bride. In contrast to the primitive
colors in Tulip’s frocks was the subtle
shading of the frocks worn by the women
in the audience. Mrs. Alan Potter’s beige-
lace bodice starred with diamante was
allied to a long black satin skirt. Blonde
Mrs. Pierre Mann twined one of the new
fox stoles around her black crepes. Pink-
and - black - candy - striped sheers were
w'orn by Mrs. Anthony Hordern junior.
The contrast of raspberry-red coat and
ivory-crepe frock was admired on Mrs.
Sam Jones.
How many of us have gone into a
lion’s-den and ran our fingers from mouth
to tail-tip of the king or queen of beasts?
That is just another of the heroic things
Helen Keller has done in her determina-
tion to know what the animals of this
world of ours look like. The story of
how Helen has made friends with almost
every animal kept in zoos was told at
Mrs. Olive Moore’s morning-party last
week. Some of the most savage types of
apes (the female of the species) turned and
licked the hand that so gently, but so
fearlessly, smoothed them. The Phoenix
Club members, guests of the party, pre-
sented Helen with a toy koala, and one
of the girls, whose hobby is pottery, had
made Helen a pair of small china dogs.
Incidentally, in Miss Keller’s home there
1 are Great Danes. For nobody else but
1 Helen will they stir when they are taking
1 their lordly ease. But at Miss Keller’s
approach the great creatures stand up.

Mary Goddard and Bronia Stuckgold are
prepared to bring it home to you for a
very modest library fee. The two
young women, after being demobbed
from the A.W.A.S. a little over a
year ago, got busy and started a
mobile library. They had a special
body fitted with shelves built for
their car, bought up about 400 books of
fiction, travel and biography, circularised
North Sydney, Mosman, Neutral Bay,
Kirribilli, and set out. With the excep-
tion of Tuesday, which they spend in the
city renewing their stock, the girls are
busy all week delivering and collecting
books. The MalbOro Library is flourish-
ing, and these two well-known north-of-
the-harbor girls (Bronia is a Mosman-
ite and Mary is one of the Kirribilli
Goddards) only need a larger vehicle to
double the number of their subscribers.
Enith Clarke reaffirmed in the Con-
servatorium last Wednesday night that
she is among Sydney’s leading women
pianists. Sydney, and all Australia for
that matter, has known it for some time,
for Enith has given recitals in person
and over the air many times in the last
few years. The Conservatorium was
packed with fashionable as well as musi-
cal Sydney. One standard topped by one
alabaster-like vase of white and palely-
pink blooms decked the stage. It was set
at the correct distance from the very large
piano at which the small pianist, in a
swirl of lucent white moires, was playing
in virtuoso style. Director of the Con.,
Eugene Goossens, and Mrs. Goossens
were in the audience. The Governor’s
daughter, Elizabeth Northcott, and Sheila
Collett were at the concert, and were
among the guests at the supper party
arranged for the artist at the Roland
Fosters’ flat after the concert.
Pretty and sparkling brown-haired
Moira McDermott and Kenneth John
Prior have just announced their engage-
ment. Moira, an ex-Loretto Convent girl,
is a daughter of E. S. McDermott and
the late Mrs. McDermott, of Balmoral.
Kenneth John (Jack) is a son of The
Bulletin’s managing-director, H. K.
Prior. He is ex-A.1.F,, having served in
the New Guinea campaign.
Dr. J. W. Thornton was the guest-of-
honor at an Overseas Club lunch last
week. You still remember, don’t
you, the English doctor who arrived in
Australia with wife and family and
enough tents to house them all? Dr. J.
W. Thornton is the man, and the roof-
tree is spreading over the entire family,
plus an English naval officer and his wife,
at Mona Vale. * j
It’s a real canvas colony. There are
two sleeping-tents and a caravan, a din-
ing-room tent, a bathroom and other
mod. cons., all under canvas. The Thorn-
ton youngsters are loving it. Each of
them plays a different musical instru-
ment. So it’s not all “canned” music in
this south-of-the-Equator home. During
the war years in England the Thornton
children formed themselves into an
orchestra and raised hundreds of pounds
for welfare funds. The doctor made a
forceful speech on “The Spirit of Eng-
land.”
Homeward-bound ferry passengers last i
Wednesday, during the cocktail hour, had
sounds of conviviality wafted to them
from the motor-ship Annenkerk. The
Annenkerk .was lying at No. 4 wharf.
Circular Quay, and in her at the invita-
tion of Captain J. Roders and J. M.
Lamens, general-manager of the Hol-
land-Australia Line, 100 well-known
Sydney businessmen were enjoying
Netherlands hospitality.
The two daughters of well-known
man of law Vincent Brady, of
Manly, recently became engaged. In
early May, elder daughter Yvonne will be
married to McEllister Leonard. Yvonne,
an ex-student of the Presbyterian Ladies
College, Pymble, was an active worker
with the Victoria League and the
American Red Cross during the war.
McEllister Leonard, recently returned
from America, served in R.A.A.F.
in Bomber Command mainly over
Germany and was awarded the
D.S.C. At present he is acting chief
A.M.P. Oil executive in absence of
managing-director W. Walkley, in
Europe and America. Younger daughter,
Adene, last week flew to Perth to meet
the parents of her fiance, John Cookson ;
they are visiting Australia to look over
pastoral and mining interests in the West.
John, an old Harrovian, met Adene
whilst in Sydney with the fleet air arm
of the R.N.

existed in 1939 the shipping scene has
been largely rubbed out and is now being
redrawn. The co.’s fleet of two passenger
and half a dozen cargo vessels was re-
quisitioned by the Navy and/or Shipping
Board during the war. They have all been
handed back except the Westralia, which
is still ferrying troops and supplies to
and from Japan. After doing good work
as a hospital ship, the Wanganella took
up the trans-Tasman run again at end
1946, but grounded at the entrance to
Wellington harbor early in 1947, and has
been out of commission since. Anticipa-
tions are that she will be on the run once
more by end July next —delays in
delivery of material have been the
trouble.
The inter-State cargo vessels were re-
leased in August, 1947, but are con-
tributing little, if anything, in the way of
profit; this owing to the high and rising
level of costs, which have been aggravated
by industrial hold-ups and go-slow tactics
on the waterfront and by the slow turn-
round of ships—the Corio was idle for
months owing to an industrial dispute.
It all means loss to the public as well as
the co., because higher freight and hand-
ling charges finally express themselves in
higher prices for goods. A further lift
in freight rates is inevitable, says the
chairman. Some idea of the mess into
which the Government landed the in-
dustry can be gathered from the fact that,
in its requisitioned-tonnage section, the
Commonwealth Shipping Board made a
loss of £8,608,000-odd from its inception
in 1941 to June 30 last. Now the owners
are left to struggle with the industrial
chaos that was largely responsible for
the loss, while the Government says what
freight and passage rates can be charged,
when ships are to be scrapped and where
new ones are to be built. Today the
price of new tonnage built in Australian
yards is so high that it offers little
prospect of profitable return on the out-
lay.
After providing for depreciation
(£43,798, down £27,836), there was a con-
traction of £70,826 in the year’s profit
from shipping, etc., reducing the figure to
£15,263, or 2\ p.c, on the written-down
book value of ships, tugs, etc. Income
from investments was £126,964 (up
£14,310) ; there was little change in credit
adjustments (£22,308) on account of
variations in balancing dates of sub-
sidiaries. After allowing for directors’
fees (£1800), taxation (£30,811, down
£38,011) and outside shareholders’ in-
terests (£10,310), net earnings were
£16,958 lighter at £121,614. That was
enough to pay 6 p.c. on the half-million
of pref. money and show 12.2 p.c. on
the £750,000 of ord. capital, compared
with 14.5, 15.9, 9.8, 10.3, 12.7 and 14.7
p.c. back to 1941. It leaves out of the
reckoning a net unexplained addition of
£63,181 to reserves, after charging in-
surance account (down £32,567) with that
portion of the loss on salvage of the
Wanganella borne by the co. The div,
remained at 12 p.c., and has done so for
the last eight years. It should be remem-
bered that capital (£1,250,000) has the
support and assistance of £2,343,431 of
visible reserves.
Investments outside the business com-
prise £1,575,930 of Government securities
and £1,121,820 (book value) of share-
holdings. The lastmentioned include
scrip in Hebburn, Metropolitan and I.
and A. Brown and Abermain Seaham
Collieries —all in the distraught coal
trade —and in Melbourne Steam, Tas-
manian Steamers Pty., A.W.A. and
A.N.A, Last year A.W.A, returned part
of its capital at a handsome profit to
most shareholders.

the undertaking is financially:

It seems that the Pharmaceutical
Benefits Bill will introduce an era of free
prescribed medicines at a stage when
doctors’ services are still outside the free
list, and not absolutely certain to join it.
This cart-before-the-horse procedure is
one factor in the uncertain outlook for
pharmacists now that politics are taking
a hand in their affairs.
So long as the public has to pay
doctors’ fees before obtaining prescrip-
tions there will hardly be a spectacular
increase in dispensing business like that
in Maoriland —where the annual number
of prescriptions has doubled in less than
five years, to the considerable benefit of
chemists and drug-makers (B. 31/3/’4B,
page 27). Nevertheless, some additional
business can be expected after the bill is
implemented. The initial dispensing fees
which the Government has contracted to
pay are believed to be not unreasonable
from the pharmacists’ viewpoint; but the
terms will be subject to renewal annually.
If the Government succeeds in introduc-
ing its whole costly scheme of socialised
medicine, the rush of new prescriptions
will doubtless lead to reductions in unit
fees —which may eventually be fixed quite
arbitrarily. Moreover, increased sales of
prescribed medicines will be partly at
the expense of sales of patent lines.
Washington H, Soul will be affected by
all these aspects of the new legislation.
Besides running a chain of about 40
retail pharmacies in and around Sydney,
the co. manufactures and sells wholesale
a wide range of druggists’ supplies and
patent medicines. The business has an
extraordinarily successful record: three-
quarters of its capital has been issued
free to shareholders from reserves; divi-
dends over the past 30 years have aver-
aged 131 p.c., and present capital is more
than offset in the books by holdings of
cash and public securities.
Last term cash was reduced by £135,199
to finance a £52,566 rise in stocks and
£80,447 expenditure on fixed assets (de-
tails not given):

Allowing for a bonus issue of £22,050
since the close of accounts (lifting capital
to £463,050), the £1 shares have net cover
of 38s. each on conservative book values.
Disclosed profit of £86,897 —an increase
of £6684 on 1946—was struck after pro-
viding an extra £2521 for depreciation
(£4192). Annual tax provisions aren’t
specified, and it has to be assumed
that the latest profit takes account of the
abolition of War-time (Co.) Tax. The
£86,987 represents 10 p.c. on shareholders’
funds including reserves, or 19.7 p.c. on
capital alone, compared with 18.2, 17.7
and 17.3 p.c. back to 1944.
The final outcome of political intrusions
into pharmacy is rather dubious, but
in the immediate future it appears that
earning power will not be reduced. Con-
fidence of the market in Washington H.
Soul’s prospects is expressed in the current
price of 975. 6d. for the £1 shares. Yield
at that figure is 3 p.c. on the basis of last
year’s div.

After the worked-out Central mine at
the Barrier (N.S.W.) closed down in
March, 1940, the co. became an industrial
undertaking, with a capital structure too
large for its immediate and foreseeable
needs. So the problem was, and still is,
reconstruction of the capital account —
there are 600,000 £1 non-cum. participat-
ing prefs. and $ like number of 15s.
ords. —on a basis fair to both lots of
shareholders in the light of future earn-
ing power of the business.
First war, and then post-war controls,
shortages and inflated costs (they are
still rising) obscured a clear view of the
level at which earnings are likely to
settle, thus delaying proposals for capital
reorganisation. However, the board will
soon be “putting forward proposals for
consideration” of shareholders. The
chairman says:
It is dear that without some reconstruc-
tion ord. shareholders cannot hope for any
return on their capital in the near future.
I hope, too, that the preference shareholders
will think our scheme is not unfair to them.
With high rates of profit tax and with the
low ’ rate of interest on Commonwealth
securities, a co. holding a large part of its
capital in gilt-edged securities cannot hope
to pay a pref. div. of 10 p.c. when more
than half of its capital is preference, as in
our own case. I wish to emphasise that
even if our reconstruction proposals are
accepted by both classes of shareholders,
I cannot see the ords. receiving more than
• a very modest dividend indeed on our
present turnover.
No details of the proposed reconstruction
have been made available to date. Ori-
ginally the idea was to slash ss. off each
ord. share, return 10s. per pref. share in
cash and reduce the div. from 10 p.c, non-
cum. participating to a fixed cumulative
6 p.c., plus the right to a small bonus in
the event of liquidation. However, can-
cellation of anticipated tax liabilities and
existing reserves enabled the Central mine
(in at £167,670) to be rubbed out of the
accounts in 1944, thus removing the need
to jettison any ord. capital.
The co.’s works at Cockle Creek
(N.S.W.) turn out cement, superphosphate
and sulphuric and hydrochloric acid;
limestone is obtained from the co.’s own
quarry at Attunga near by. The acid
comes from the roasting of zinc concen-
trates from the Barrier for Electrolytic
Zinc. Last term production of cement
increased by 50 p.c., reaching 50,000 tons
(plant capacity 80,000 tons), acid output
rose by 25 p.c. and super, by 28 p.c.—
sales were handicapped by shortage of
railway trucks. P. and 1. figures responded
in this way:

Last year’s profit excludes £7448 from
tax reserve (overprovided in the previous
year) and a capital profit of £354 on sale
of investments. The pref. div., main-
tained at a nominal 5 p.c. for the preced-
ing nine years, was lifted to a nominal
6 p.c., which English income tax of 9s.
in the £ reduces to an effective 3.3 p.c.
(stg.) in the hands of shareholders. The
ords. have not received a div. since 1937*
On half present pref. capital 6 p.c.,
less 9s. in the £ tax, would call for £9900.
On the basis of last year’s trading profit,
that would leave £5237 (after payment of
tax), or 1.16 p.c. (stg.), for the present
£450,000 of ord. capital. In Australia the
ords. are priced at 11s. 6d., at which
figure the return (in Australian currency)
would be 2.3 p.c. on a nominal 2 p.c.
(stg.) div. basis, after allowing for English
tax and for exchange at current rates.
The prefs. are priced at 255. At 15s.
(assuming a 10s. return of capital) the
yield .would be 2.7 p.c. (Australian cur-
rency) on a nominal - 6 p.c. div. basis,
again after allowing for English tax and
for exchange at current rates.

When the books closed cash and Govern-
ment securities, etc., totalled £108,397
more than the pref. capital. Although
no capital expenditure has been incurred
at Cockle Creek for some years, plant is
reported in “fair” condition. The
Attunga quarry is being mechanised, and
permission had been received to start coal
mining, which should help output gener-
ally as well as ease the pressure of costs.

POINTS FROM THE CHAIRMAN'S ADDRESS
I am glad to be able to report that the Association has
experienced another very successful year. New Business
again increased substantially. The Association last year
issued 48,672 New Policies assuring £23,377,113. The
premium income is up by half a million the total net
income being £8,533,867. The interest rate has been
well maintained the average rate earned was £4/2/5
per cent.; after deduction of rates and taxes the net
rate was £3/13/3 per cent. Expenses of New Business
are relatively less than in previous years. The total ex-
penses are reasonable, having regard to the rising costs
of services and supplies. The Assurance Fund has been
increased by 3£ millions to £64,686,653. And what
may interest you more bonuses are being fully
maintained.
The Association’s activities cover “Ordinary” Business
only, and do not extend to “Industrial” Life Business.
The "National Mutual" has Funds available
for Home Purchase Loans, and other first
class mortgages in town and country.
It pays to become a member of this progressive, purely
mutual Association. There are NO shareholders.

fourths of the Third Preference shares, no further shares ranking
in priority to, or pari passu with, the present issue may be issued.
OBJECTS OF THE ISSUE.
The new capital is required to finance the erection of new
factories and installation of new plant in Australia by the Company
and its subsidiaries, which together constitute the largest Australian
organisation concerned with the Scouring and Carbonising' of Wool,
the making of Wool Tops, the production of Felt Products, "Feltex”
and “Teprac” Floor Coverings, and the manufacture of Carpets
and a wide range of Footwear, The company also holds substantial
interests in New Zealand and South Africa. In 1947 turnover of
the group (exclusive of South Africa) reached £12,803,019, whilst
in Australia alone the group was conducting 65 factories, employing
5773 persons, and processing 55,000,0001b5. of wool annually.
The minimum subscription on which the Directors may proceed
to allotment is £1,260,000.

Some of the holdings were sold
last term, reducing their aggre-
gate book value in the parent’s
accounts to £89,194 (down
£33,468). The money was used
to wipe out a guaranteed over-
draft of Austral N.Z. Mining.
With one eye on the prospects of
the group, and the other on a
part-return of capital later on,
the market (Sydney) prices the
pound shares at 70s. each, as
against 595. nine months ago.
At Kampong Kamunting the
original Kamunting sector, prac-
tically worked out, is to be let on
tribute again. On the Karangan
sector the dredge worked inter-
mittently from end 1946 to
May, 1947, and has since run
continuously free of trouble.
For seven months to end Jan.,
1947, it handled 981,000 c.y. for
195 tons t. 0., and an estimated
working profit of £30,462. There
was about 15 months’ work
ahead at mid.-1947, with another
two-year job in a contiguous
area, purchase of which is still
subject to negotiation. Co.’s
war - damage claims total
£75,000, against which £37,286
had been spent on rehabilitation
account at end June, 1947. The
scrip fetches 30s. in the market.
After a prolonged strike,
Thabawleik’s dredge got under
way again on Sept. 1, 1947, and
dug 332,000 c.y.—most of it
already handled during the
occupation—for 46 tons t.o. to
end Nov. For the following
month the return was 58 tons
t.o. Co.’s war-damage claims
total £88,000; rehabilitation ex-
penditure to end June last was
£43,253. About 5,000,000 c.y.,
averaging nearly a pound t. 0.,
await treatment. An adjoining
area is being investigated, and
prospecting licences over other
ground have been applied for.
The pound shares are priced at
595. 3d.
Owing to the politically-dis-
turbed state of Siam, it was only
recently decided to repossess the
property at Pungah, and rehabi-
litation began early in 1948.
No, 2 dredge, damaged by im-
mersion in salt-water, is to be
scrapped. It is too early yet to
say exactly when No. 1, a
250.000- machine,
will set in. There are 18,000,000
c.y. of 0.871 b. ground awaiting
treatment. In 1940, with two
dredges at work, the co. netted
£217,243 and paid ss. a share.
Co. claims £140,000 fpr ore ex-
tracted during occupation, and
payment of £20,000 from the
Buffer Pool (Siam) is due. No
formal claim for war damage
has yet been submitted. The
pound shares fetch 31s. 6d. in
the market.
Of Austral Amalgamated’s
three areas, Asam Kumbang no
longer amounts to much. The
dredge has been dismantled, but
might be reassembled if lease of
an adjoining area is granted.
Gravel pumps began to treat
remaining ore reserves last De-
cember. Ulu Yam’s 150,000-c.y,-
a-month steam dredge handled
1,170,000 c.y. for 400 tons t.o.
during eight months to Dec.,
1947. A new bucket band is on
order, and adjoining ground has
been applied for. Over
21.000. c.y. of tested ground,
averaging 0.601 b., lies ahead of
the dredge. Puchong’s bi g
350.000- on t h machine
awaits delivery of electrical
equipment. It has over
59.000. c.y. of 0,371 b. ground
to handle, plus some 16,000,000
c.y. of marginal dirt. Austral
Amalgamated’s war - damage
claims, etc,, for all its mines total
£370,000. Rehabilitation expen-
diture to end June, 1947, was
£96,968. The ss. shares .fetch
17s. 9d. in the market.
Subject to industrial and poli-
tical developments, steady pro-
gress is expected during 1948.
Only 70 p.c. of amounts applied
for has been received from the
Government for rehabilitation.
Basic buying price for Malayan
tin at £504 (stg.) is about double
pre-war level. Over the same
period costs, still rising, have
more than doubled in most
cases. The recently-imposed
Malayan income tax of 20 p.c.
on profits will bite into net earn-
ings. This is in addition to the
14 p.c. export duty on gross pro-
ceeds from tin ore.

"Pastoral Symphony."
Under the almost continual
onslaught of superficial trash
that emanates from the screen
it is easy to forget the potenti-
alities of films. Admittedly
they can never replace the stage
—the latter has the overwhelm-
ing advantage of creating in
front of its audience, while the
screen merely presents a record
of something already accom-
plished. Apart from that, how-
ever, the screen can use practi-
cally every artistic and technical
device of the stage, adding closer
direction and more thorough re-
vision as well as photographic
art and an almost unlimited
range of action, scene and light-
ing.
A most arresting example of
the screen at its best is the
French film “Pastoral Sym-
phony,” based on a story by
Andre Gide and showing at
Melbourne Australia apd Syd-
ney Savoy. It tells, in the quiet,
polished, classical French
fashion, the story of a country
pastor who rescues a blind,
semi-savage and apparently half-
witted girl from the bedside of
her dead mother and dedicates
himself to saving her soul.
The girl grows into a beauti-
ful, intelligent, attractive young
woman, the lack of one sense
having sharpened the others.
The pastor hasn’t yet discovered
that he has ordinary human
feelings, though his nagging wife
has. His son comes home from
Paris and falls in love with the
blind girl. His jealous fiancee
-suggests that there may be a
physical cure for her blindness,
and she is sent off to Paris to
the doctors.
There is a remarkable scene
when she enters the pastor’s
church in the middle of a ser-
vice, completely cured and with
greater potentialities than ever
for making a hash of the pas-
tor’s household. Here the care-
ful understatement of the French
acting and directing comes into
its own, and the quiet, lyrical
development of the story mounts
suddenly but naturally to its
tremendous crisis. When the love
of the pastor for the girl, the
wife’s fury and despair, the
mutual hatreds of the son and
father and the conflict in the
girl between her beliefs and feel-
ings all become conscious there
is a dynamo of compressed
emotions in the film.
The suicide of the girl is the
somewhat conventional, though
possibly inevitable, resolution of
the story. Anyway, the solution
is only a moment in the play—
it would be no different had the
girl been killed or had she
she simply walked out of the
pastor’s household. The story
itself, a natural development of
events to a tragic and inextric-
able tangle of human lives and
emotions, is what really matters.
It is all there, told with superb
perception of human behavior ;
acted with extraordinary sensi-
tiveness by Michele Morgan as
the blind girl, Pierre Blanchard
as the pastor and Line Noro as
his wife; and directed and
photographed with matching
sympathy and artistry.
“Captain Boycott,” at Sydney
Embassy, deals with some tur-
bulent farmland in the west of
Ireland. Possibly a benevolent
type compared with some con-
temporary landlords. Boycott
(Cecil Parker) was considered a
harsh man in his day and an
adept at hurling his tenants out
on to the moors. Decrying such
doings, Robert Donat makes a
brief appearance as a be-
whiskered Parnell: “Ostracise
these he advises, and,
soothed by the wisdom, the mob
of farmers cools down to a mere
200° F. When Stewart Granger,
an incurable swashbuckler,
hears that horseplay is out he
breaks into a bewildered frown
which is with him to the end.
Eddie Byrne, the quick-witted
village postman, gives a far
more subtle performance, but
even he is overshadowed by
an excellent stretch of acting
from Alastair Sim.
Berger and Goossens.
The Sydney Symphony Or-
chestra opened the 1948 season
with a magnificent reading of
Brahms’s Symphony No. 3 in F
Major. The broad sweep, the
grandeur and all the philosophic
resignation which the composer
poured into this noble music
were brought out under Goos-
sens’s baton. The work of the
woodwinds in the opening
allegro movement and the serene
singing of the strings in the
contemplative andante were
memorable. An almost ethereal
quality was lent the haunting
theme of the third movement,
probably the finest example of
pure melody to be found in
Brahms’s four symphonies.
The Suite from John Antill’s
ballet “Corroboree” unaccount-
ably made no provision for a
blurtophone practically every
other instrument seemed to be
in use, including a bulldozer —
no, a bull-roarer. Perhaps noth-
ing quite so utterly individualis-
tic, so bizarre has ever been per-
formed by a full orchestra. An-
till’s problem was clear: the
standard music of Western civi-
lisation could patently not be
used as representing the dance
music of Australia’s aborigines,
who knew no melody or har-
mony as such. Perforce he had
to fall back on rhythm—the basis
of the dance form —and tone-
color. There is a hint of melody
in the fascinating Rain Dance.
The composer’s counterpoint is
sound, his use of unusual effects
telling—no more striking em-
ployment of the celeste could be
imagined; this was a master-
strike. But at times the impact
of the tympani section became
almost intolerable; then the
crashings and the ululations
would melt away to the light play
of strings against the faint but in-
exorable throbbing of the drums.
One thing is obvious, however
—the music should be heard with
the accompaniment of leaping
pipe-clayed and ochred figures
against the background of the
tribal fires, for the music and
choreography are wedded. The
music is for the theatre, not the
concert stage.
Debussy’s “La Mer” was less
of a representation of the sea
than a mild attack of musical
mal de mer. It might just as well
have been titled “Rhapsody on
Wandering Through a Tannery”
for all the seascape it evoked.
Debussy fills only a microscopic
niche in the large orchestral wall.
A Goossens transcription of the
Bach Choral Prelude “Come,
God Creator,” was a delectable
morsel.
In two arias of Mozart opera
—at once the delight and the
despair of most coloraturas —
Erna Berger revealed a voice of
great purity and range. She
lifts it to the high altitudes with
surpassing ease, whilst her
mezzct voce is beautifully con-
trolled. Added to these qualities
are a refined approach to the
most refined of all operatic writ-
ing, an engaging presence and a
vibrant eagerness that is inherent
in the voice. The sustained and
difficult “Martern aller arten”
from “II Seraglio” was taken at
a tripping tempo, yet the flight
from an almost contralto section
to the upper reaches, with many
typical Mozartian embellish-
ments en route, didn’t cause the
soprano to call for more than
the usual breath reserves. Her
“attack” was always certain and
sure, her feeling for climax
natural.

THE STORY OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES
bS
WARS POSTPONED!
So great was the importance of the Ancient Olympic
Games that any wars in progress were terminated by
mutual agreement or postponed so that competitors
from distant lands could pass unmolested through
intervening territories to Elis, where the Games
were held.
This rule held good almost without exception,
throughout the many hundreds of years the Ancient
Olympic Games were held—from 7768. C. to 293 A.D.

John Mayow - -
Air is necessary both to keep
a fire alight and to maintain life. Though this
important fact has been known for thousands of
years, it was an English chemist and physican,
John Mayow, who first proved by practical experi-
ments that only a part of air supports life and that
there is a great similarity between breathing and
burning. This part of the air, which we now know
to be oxygen, Mayow called the nitro-aerial
spirit.” He kept a mouse in a jar of air closed by
a bladder and observed that the bladder bulged
inwards probably with the contraction of the air
inside as the mouse used up the oxygen. He also
observed that a mouse alone in a closed jar lived
twice as long as a mouse kept in a jar together with
a burning lamp, showing that both mouse and lamp
were using up the same part of the air.
Though Mayow produced some remarkably
shrewd theories on chemical affinity and was one
of the first chemists to explain how nitric acid is
produced by the action of sulphuric acid on nitre,
his reputation rests on his work as a practical ex-
perimenter. He was born in London in 1643 and
entered Wadham College, Oxford, in 1658. He
died at Bath at the early age of thirty-five, a few
months after his election to the
Fellowship of the Royal Society.
John Mayow, English physician, was
one of several chemists who helped
to solve the riddle of combustion —
one of the most fundamental reactions
in chemistry.

RED MILL RUM.
Favored, for once, with a day of
perfect weather, City Tattersall’s Club
held a most successful meeting at
Randwick on Saturday. An attend-
ance of 41,000, and tote turnover of
£171,041, were record figures for the
club. On paper, bookmakers didn’t
appear to have a very good day, the
longest-priced winners being a couple
of 8-to-l shots. However, this was
an indication of open fields and
cramped betting odds rather than
successful picking by the majority of
punters.
Within the limits of his stamina,
the Ajax colt Mine Host is probably
the fastest horse racing in Sydney at
present, but, unfortunately, he has
developed into a thorough rogue at
the barrier. After playing up, he
got away badly in the six-furlongs
James Clarke Stakes and, though
quickly to the front, he didn’t get
much of a break on the field. At
the finish he was unable to withstand
the strong run produced by the lightly-
weighted Love Star (A. Podmore).
Gay Monarch was third and Petulance
made a surprisingly forward showing.
Drawn wide out at the awkward
10-furlongs barrier for the City Tatt’s
Handicap, the three-year-old Lysander
was hard ridden by Sellwood to be
well up with the leaders after they’d
travelled a short distance. Holding
his position well, he went to the front
at the leger and won running away.
Blue Legend showed that he is no
spent force by finishing very stoutly
to pip Laudus for second money. By
Midstream from Idle Words, Lysander
is an aptly-named full-brother to
Shannon.
There was almost the unusual spec-
tacle of full-brothers winning a
double, Bembrook, another brother of
Shannon, finishing a close second and
unlucky not to win the John Barkel
Youthful Stakes. Prior to the start
he broke through the barrier, and the
elastics, catching rider N. Sellwood,
catapulted him yards away to a heavy
fall. He remounted at once but was
too badly shaken to do his mount
justice and was beaten a half-length
by the Le Grand Due gelding Meteor.
The Gus Mooney Three-year-old
Handicap provided much the best
finish of the day with four horses
reaching the judge almost on terms.
The Le Grand Due colt Lord Des-
mond had been sent to the outside
for unrujiness at the barrier, and
was well back in the field till they
turned for home, but, finishing
strongly down the straight, he just
nutted Slander and Rio Fe with
Altarian fourth. The margins between
them were a head, half-head and half-
length.
Successful on Meteor and Lord
Desmond, jockey G. Moore made it
a treble by landing Fra Diavolo
ahead of Parramatoo and Deed in
the Club Welter. Stewards opened
and adjourned an inquiry into the
performance of Deed, who started
equal favorite with the winner. Two
divisions of the Rowley Eaton Novice
Handicap, run over a mile, were won
by Miss Corrogin (E. Fordyce) and
Circus Boy (W. Cook).
* * * *
Racing in Melbourne on Saturday
was a charity fixture at Moonee
Valley, where punters had varied luck,
winners comprising an equal mixture
of favorites and rank outsiders."
Two-year-old events are usually
reasonably good for punters, but two
divisions of the Junior Plate, open-
ing the card, were disastrous, the
winners respectively 50 to 1 and 33
to 1.
Ridden by veteran cross-country
jockey Frank Dummett, the aptly-
named Spoor (by Footmark) led all
the way to take the first division from
Pipe Dream and favorite Lepidus.
Quoted at 50 to 1 by the cautious
bagmen, Spoor paid a little less
than 100 to 1 on the tote, returning
£24 14s. 6d. for a five-bob win ticket.
However, Mira (N. Powell), who
downed Poona and Magnetic Vale in
the second division, was 33 to 1 with
the books and paid roughly the same
odds on the tote.
Run later in the day, a third
division of the same event produced
a more favorable result, being won
by the heavily-backed, South Aus-
tralian-owned Tetrare (W. William-
son). A son of the grey stallion
Theio (standing ip. New Zealand),
Tetrare is of the unusual roan
coloration. South Australian owner-
ship was again successful when the
much-travelled Cargeonel (R. Heather)
defeated Euxine and William Tell
in the mile Mission Highweight. Car-
geonel, who used to race in Sydney,
started favorite at fours.
A good winner at his previous start,
the Hellespont colt Hororata (R.
Heather) returned another tiptop effort
by lumping 9.2 to gamely, though
very narrowly, beat Trumps and
Viceroy in the mile Society Handi-
cap for three-year-olds. Trumps was
beaten only a neck after losing a
good deal more than that by run-
ning wide at the turn.
A trio of six-year-olds filled the
places in the Institute Handicap, a
staying test run over 13 furlongs.
Winner was the Blank mare Miss
Prim, followed home by An tares and
Valcurl. The Nurses’ Handicap, run
over six furlongs less 20yds., went
to a rough ’un in Blue Smoke (N.
Powell), a recent arrival from W.A.
Going straight to the front, he ran
some noted fast beginners off their
legs in the first couple of furlongs
and had a lot in hand from St. Dandy
and Hellenist at the finish. Rising
“Easy there, fellers—I've got a bite!”
14., the Gay Lothario gelding Gay
Invader (R. Hall) gave some of his
juniors a jumping lesson in the Appeal,
Steeple.

Completed last week, the annual
Sydney yearling sale produced record
figures. For the first time the sale
had to be spread over four days in-
stead of the usual three. In all, 525
youngsters were sold for an aggregate
of 286,765 guineas; both those figures
are unprecedented, but the average
price of 546£ guineas fell below the
record average of 606 guineas in 1946.
Sales of brood mares and racehorses
brought the total return for six days’
transactions to 349,2 guineas.
Of the yearlings, 74 lots fetched
1000 guineas or over. Percy Miller,
of Kia-Ora Stud, was once again the
most successful seller, with 38 year-
lings bringing in 45,935 guineas.
Progeny of Kia-Ora’s leading sire,
Midstream, were most popular with
buyers, 10 lots bringing 23,500

Next Saturday will see the annual
gathering of frenzied small fry on
the banks of the Nepean (N.S.W.)
for the Sydney G.P.S. regatta. There’ll
be an extra minute or so strain on
the lungs of barrackers this year,
the distance of the race having, re-
grettably, been changed back from
10 furlongs to a mile and a half.
Apart from being less severe on
ybuthful oarsmen, the mile-and-a-
quarter trip approximates to the
standard Olympic distance of 2000
metres and should have been-main-
tained.
Also down for next Saturday, the
Brisbane G.P.S. regatta, with Bris-
bane State High School making a
reappearance after some years’ ab-
sence. The school gave rowing a
miss during the war years.

John Bromwich appears to have
the chance of a lifetime to bring home
the Wimbledon title this year. With
America’s Ted Schroeder an absentee,
Bromwich’s toughest opponents will
be Frank Parker, the Czechoslovakian
Drobny, and his fellow-Australian,
Sedgman.

John Marshall added to his list
of swimming records when, at Rich-
mond (Vic.) baths last he
knocked three seconds off Geoff
Vockler’s State record for the 440
yds.; the record had stood since
1933. Marshall now holds every Vic-
torian record from 110yds. to a mile.
Other members of the Olympic
team also continue to batter the
records. Brisbane’s 17-years-old Nancy
Lyons clipped nearly seven seconds
from the Australian 100yds. breast-
stroke record, when she was timed
at Imin. ll.Ssec. in North Sydney
pool. Clocking 53.25ec., Bruce Bourke
broke his own Australian record for
the 100yds. backstroke.

“M.H.”: Bradman’s record of
eight centuries in Australia last season
(B. 24/3/’4B) recalls his record of
centuries in England. With the Aus-
tralian XI in 1938 Don piled up
13 centuries in 20 matches —a record
tally by an Aussie on tour. However,
Jack Hobbs’s 16 centuries in 1925
when 42 years old, be it not forgotten
—is still high and dry for aspirants
to aim at.

There’s tradition in English cricket!
Cabled that Norman Yardley (vice-
captain of the M.C.C. XI in Aus-
tralia recently) is taking his wife to
live in Yorkshire until the baby
arrives in July. Should a son be
born, he will then be eligible to play
for that county in English cricket.
While other counties permit players
to qualify by residence, Yorkshire
demands qualification by birth.

Much the better boxer, Billy de
Belin (10.7) outpointed Alfle Sands
(10.7) at Leichhardt. Alfie’s forceful
fighting had De Belin in trouble at
times, particularly with a battery of
solidly-connecting swings in the sixth
and seventh rounds. De Belin, how-
ever, pulled himself together, and won
the last five rounds by a very wide
margin.'
* * * *
At Petone (N-Z.), Alfie’s older
brother Dave Sands (11.10) gave the
New Zealand heavyweight champion
Don Mullet two stone weight and a
hiding in a 12-rounder.
* * * *
At Melbourne Stadium, Cliff Jones
(9.3 i), a Victorian of the southpaw
persuasion, k.o.’d New South Welsh-
man Ken Wenman in the eighth of
what were to have been 12 rounds.
It was a gory battle with both fighters
thoroughly knocked about, and Wen-
man was subsequently taken to hos-
pital in bad shape.

Sterling Stronger
Congress approval of the Mar-
shall Plan has brought about a
strengthening of sterling in New
York, and prospects of devalua-
tion have been projected to the
distant future, according to
financial cables.
Britain, on present estimates,
is to get the equivalent, in dol-
lars, of over £5OO million sterl-
ing during the 15 months to
June 30, 1949. This should be
of vast help to the U.K.
economy, especially as it will
represent a gift without the
strings that accompanied the
previous loan, and there has
been a check to the rise in some
prices since the beginning of
1948, wheat especially.
Britain’s production position
has been improving, but there
will need to be no slackening in
efforts to balance overseas trade.
Marshall-plan aid is intended for
no other purpose than rehabili-
tation, and it would be fatal for
industrial Britain to regard it in
the wrong light. And that is no
doubt why there has been a soft-
pedalling on the improvement
that has occurred in the immedi-
ate economic outlook since Con-
gress approval of the plan last
month.
The Cripps Budget aims at a
surplus of £330 million sterling
for the current year, which has
no direct influence on the over-
seas position, but which is hoped
to have an effect on the infla-
tionary internal situation.
The Sharemarket
A substantial recovery in
share prices has followed the re-
opening of Australian ’Changes
since Easter, but not all stocks
have moved up. B.H.P. and
Electrolytic Zinc have made out-
standing gains, and at 595. last
week B.H.P. was only a shilling
or two below the highest figure
of the year. Electrolytic Zinc
at 765. 3d. was still ss. 3d. be-
low the year’s best, though up
6s. since ’Changes reopened,
London and New York prices
have been improving, and the
expansion programme of Aus-
tralian Iron and Steel announced
by Essington Lewis has had a
special influence- on B.H.P.
shares.
New Issues in N.Z.
Rights to new shares haven’t
been going too well lately on
Maoriland markets, and inves-
tors are asking, whether sopie-
thing can't be done to slacken the
brake that New Zealand’s Trea-
sury and Reserve Bank jammed
on a few months before com-
panies began to crowd one
another in a headlong rush for
new capital. Chairman T. N.
Gibbs, of Macduffs, Ltd., one of
M.L.’s lusty young cos., points
to Australia’s safety-valve of
advances up to a year if repay-
ment comes out of income, and
up to six months if out of capi-
tal (“definitely in sight”), as tl\e
answer to the difficulty.
Gibbs charges the Treasury
and top bankers with creating
an impasse as they send cos. to
shareholders for funds and then
turn investors (or shareholders)
away when they come along for
temporary accommodation to
fiuy (at premiums dic-
tated by Government bigwigs).
Investors don’t have full pockets,
but make money work, says
Gibbs. All they seek is tem-
porary aid. If they can’t get it
rights will be a chronic drug in
Maoriland sharemarkets this
year, and shareholders and cos.
will have a headache trying to
do what officialdom makes
nearly impossible. There is a
whole crop of cos. trying to get
through the gate at once, but
the villain of the piece is control
up in the box-seats.
Zinc Corporation
Zinc Corporation’s offer to
buy all the ordinary capital in
Imperial Smelting Corp. is an
important move towards vertical
integration. Completion of the
deal would extend Zinc Corp.’s
activities from the mining and
milling of zinolead-silver to the
preparation from those metals
and. their by-products of a wide
range of commercial products—
alloys, salts, acids, pigments and
fertilisers —now turned out by
Imperial Smelting. Shareholders
of the latter co. must decide by
May 5 whether they will accept
one Zinc Corp. £1 share for
each five Imperial Smelting £1
ords.
At the current price of 1255.
(sterling) for Zinc Corp. scrip,
this amounts to 255. for the Im-
perial Smelting ords., which had
net asset backing of 245. 7d. on
consolidated figures last June
and were recently quoted at
about 2,35. 3d. in London, The
two concerns were already
linked by Zinc Corp.’s holding
of about £104,000 in Imperial
Smelting, total capital of which,
£4,637,226, consists of £2,069,809
in p.c. cum. prefs. and
£2,567,417 in ords. Four direc-
tors are common to the two cos.,
including J, R. Govett, the chair-
man of each. Among the Im-
perial Smelting shareholders who
may now acquire Zinc Corp.
scrip are North Broken Hill, B.
H. South apd Electrolytic Zinc,
each of which holds about
65,000 of the sjnelting co.’s ords.
Unofficially, it*is reported that a
new zinc refinery will be built
in Australia if Zinc Corp.’s plan
is accepted.
Feltex 4 p.c, Prefs.
The public put up only about
58 p.c. of the 1 Felt and Textiles
issue of £1,260,000 in third
prefs. carrying a 4 p.c. cumula-
tive div. The yield from the
same co.’s first and second prefs.
was below 4 p.c. before the
issue, and remains so at the
current price of 30s. 6d.; but
these two classes of prefs. to-
gether amount to only £240,000.
Of several pref. issues of .other
cos, that are currently yielding
less than 4 p.c., not many are as
large as the new Feltex offering.
Very few represent 38 p.c. of a
co.’s total paid capital, as will
be the case with the Feltex third
prefs.
The whole issue having been
underwritten by J. B. Were and
Son, Feltex can proceed with
plans for new factories and in-
stallations which prompted the
issue. Overdrafts stood at
£1,845,949 last June, when stocks
comprised 46 p.c. of the group’s
total assets. Unchanged interim
divs. were declared last month.
At 625. 9d. the ords. are still
nearly ss, below the price ruling
before the general drop in
February, but they have been
steadily recovering ; yield at the
present figure is 4 p.c.
Maoriland Price-control
Traders in New Zealand are
up in arms over the prices war
waged against them by the bel-
ligerent Price Tribunal, now nine
years old, “Persecution,” not
“prosecution,” is what MX-
grocers are beginning to call the
P.T. offensive, as they charge
officialdom with pinpricking tac-
tics and excess of zeal in track-
ing down minor offenders. They
are kicking vigorously, but so far
ineffectively, against P.T. pot-
shots which they say are aimed
at profits, not prices, and writhe
as they feel a straitjacket of
red-tape tightening round them.
They want to know whether a
corner-store man who charges a
penny too much for a bottle of
tomato sauce is as culpable as a
tradesman who goes slow on the
job but still collects a full wage
scot-free of penalty.
Price-inspectors have the most
unpopular job of all enforcers of
the law in MX. today, not ex-
cepting traffic - cops or tax-
snoopers, and they haven’t many
friends among consumers, who
smart under the sting of inflated
prices. Money-pressure is too
strong for price-control to hold
it back. As fast as P.T. plugs
up holes* in the dam the flood
breaks out at some new place.
Traders don’t ask for a price-
“These harbor-views are for the ten-guinea flats .”
war anc j a free-for-all, but want
broader control by combing out
a j ot 0 f detail • this means scope

U p trade. Both retailers and con-
SU mers have had such an over-

a g a j n
M.L.’s Parliamentary Opposi-
t ion has set up a special commit-
tee to p ro be living-costs and
price-levels, with aid of outside
ex perts. Problems it sees are:
Rising prices swallowing - up
wa g e increases, production
knocked back by soaring costs,
anc j producers and traders barred
from recovering costs where
prices are pegged down hardest.
It is likely to be an outsize in-
quiry, and not before it is due.
A go-ahead young Auckland
co., M. K. Manufacturers, Ltd.,
has clinched a contract with
Battersby and Co., Stockport,
England, to make and distribute
Battersby hats in Maoriland. Be-
fore this M.K. had eight years’
training, from 1939 onwards,
under Battersby, on a “making-
only” basis. The ’prentice period
ended, M.K. seems well set in
the hat trade, but as prices are
“rigidly stabilised” it doesn’t ex-
pect much profit benefit yet.
Purchase of Battersby materials
and deliveries of other materials
awaited for many months have
built up stocks to a record of
£100,607, double last year’s
total, but the outlook is foggy
in some lines, particularly cot-
ton prints. Shortages are ex-
pected late this year. If New
Zealand’s pound rises to par
with sterling M.K. will have an
overseas exchange - fluctuation
reserve of £BOOO just created to
take the shock. The 8 p.c. div.,
absorbing £3OlO, seems assured
for a year or two.

THE HINTON PICTURES
By JOHN FOUNTAIN
At the Teachers’ College, Armidale
(N.S.W.), there is the finest collection of
Australian art anywhere—the gift of one
man, Howard Hinton. The total is
something over 1100 pictures, and not
an artist of consequence from Buvelot
till today is unrepresented,
It is staggering to realise that when
Hinton died (about the time of the Archi-
bald Prize announcements this year) the
community knew next to nothing about
him. Norman Lindsay .wrote a full-
Pf? ti ? n H° r TT ? nd
m a Plain English article the suggestion
was made that the trustees of the N.S.W.
National Art Gallery should honor his
memory by air exhibition of the scores of
pictures donated by him to that Gallery.
But the daily press was reticent or dumb-
Dailies which could always find head-
lines for the fnnpral nf a annoctpr
, . ? tuneial or a gangster
and the misfortunes of a pckey had
nothing. Yet Howard Hinton, Gallery
trustee, shipping merchant, philanthro-
pist and—above all—connoisseur, was one
vy e great men of our time, and Armi-
dale teachers College, with its thousand-
odd pictures, is there to prove it.
Sydney, perhaps, might have known
more about Hinton hcr\
more about Minton had not the Gallery,
alter accepting from him its best Norman
Lindsays and Hilders and some of its
best Gruners, refused a gift of some fine
Fnrnnpan naintinr,c onTt
a paintings and thus lost to
Armidale all Hinton s subsequent dona-
tions. It was an example of the same
shortsightedness that lost the Gallery an
important collection of Lambert’s work,
In the Hinton incident, the Gallery
refused to accept a consignment of
paintings he sent from Europe. Hinton
then sent to S. H. Smith, Director of
Education at the time, a picture called
“The Lock Gates,” by Sir Adrian Stokes,
R.A., suggesting that he might give it to
some institution under his control. Armi-
dale Teachers’ College had -just Started.
Smith sent the picture to Armidale and
wrote to Hintnn fpllina him a V,n,if
rXL l ° „. nt ° n ’ tel “ n § him about the
Lollege. Hinton sent more pictures to
the College and, in short, Sydney’s loss
was Armidale’s gain
It was Hinton’s habit in include in
~t OnS habit to include in
Jetters to the then principal, Mr. Newling,
advising him of the arrival of pictures,
notes on the pictures themselves, and one
of the fascinating sidelights of a visit to
Armidale is reading these letters. From
them one discovers not only the man’s
passion for art, but the untiring zeal of
his quest for information and his readi-
ness to hand it on. For instance, on
Nov. 20, 1935, he wrote to Mr. Newling,
with the usual catalogue of pictures sent:
Norman Lindsay—“ Don Quixote” (40
guineas), a fine watercolor; brilliant
imagination....
“Apollo’s Vanguard” (125 guineas). On
the right stands Apollo, the Greek god of
the shepherds, surrounded by flocks and
herds, and on the left Dampier, Spaniards,
Pelsart the Dutchman, Cook, Macquarie,
Bushrangers, Police, Sailors, Soldiers, etc.
A sailing-ship in the background This .
watercolor has the strength of an oil-
painting. .
Arthur Streeton —“Cutting the Tunnel”
(125 guineas), a brilliant watercolor, done
when he was only 25.
On October 26, 1934, Hinton sent
some Norman Lindsay watercolors and
other pictures, and wrote:
“Iris” and “Mermaids,” watercolors, Nor-
man Lindsay. Both of these could have
been sold half a dozen times.
“Primavera,” David Griscoe (signed on
top), oil. No brush used, all clever palette
knife work, much in vogue with the young
artists in France.
“Odysseus,” watercolor, Norman Lind-
say. Ulysses in his galley returning from
the Trojan War. Sirens flying towards the
vessel. Note. —Painted in delicate colors,
this painting should not be exposed to
bright sunlight.
Other comments, selected at random,
are; “Lance Solomon —a young Sydney
artist of great promise” ; “Gordon Esling
—studied for some years with Gruner —
his work shows it”; “H. Garlick —
promising artist —died young.” Of Mat-
son Nicholas’s “Petunias,” T. S. Wat-
kins’s “Bathers,” Fred Leist’s “Art
Students” and Dattilo Rubbo’s “In the
Sunlight” Hinton has this to say:
“Petunias”—Young Nicholas has appar-
ently left Sydney—and this was too fine
an example to let pass “Bathers”—The
first life study I have sent you. Watkins
considers it very good. Don’t overlook the
fact that every art gallery in Europe,
America and Australia have similar works
and value them “Art Students” —A bril-
liant out-of-doors study in bright sun-
light “In the Sunlight” Rubbo does
such numbers of wrinkled men and women
that I was glad to get this cheery sketch of
a Man on the Land. It was done in one
day.
Throughout the letters there is evidence
of a lively and inquiring mind. The in-
formation is not all strictly artistic. Hin-
ton observes that Streeton’s “The Old
Inn, Richmond, Hawkesbury River” is a
painting of the inn at which Streeton,
Charles Conder, Victor Mann, Tom
Roberts and Julian Ashton stayed in the
HOWARD HINTON.

the National Gallery of N.S.W.]
summer of 1896. A wash-drawing of
buffalo-hunting by Lambert, 1895, pro-
vokes the curious comment that buffaloes
were imported into the Northern Terri-
tory in 1849.
One could learn a good deal, not only
about Hinton, but about painting, from
reading the letters. And it is a tempta-
tion to soak oneself in them. But it is
the collection, after all, which is the great
attraction at Armidale.
The Teachers’ College stands on a hill
commanding a view Streeton would have
liked to paint—trees, fields and the green
undulations of little hills, falling away
from the outskirts of the town. There
are lawns, trees, gay flowers, and the
building itself is impressive—white and
brick with noble pillars. The white, un-
fortunately, is concrete, and is begin-
ning to crack, but there are limits to de-
partmental imagination. Since the Hin-
ton pictures are beginning to strain the
resources of the college, it will be neces-
sary to build a gallery some day. It
should be of stone.
Paintings meet the eye as
soon as a step is taken inside
the wide doors of the
college. They hang in the
corridors. Above the stair-
way are the “official por-
traits”—portraits of Howard
Hinton, Newling, Smith
(Director of Education)
and a portrait of a former
vice-principal. Three are
by Norman Carter, one by
Dobell. All are big can-
vases, and the Dobell is the
best.
The ground - floor cor-
ridors are lined with pic-
tures —at a casual glance
one can see a Longstaff, a
Lance Solomon, a Margaret
Coen and a Norman Lind-
say—and the lecture-rooms
are similarly loaded. Up
the big stairs there are cor-
ridors again, with pictures,
and facing the stairs the
foyer, with the European
pictures. Then along to the
library, with its Streetons,
and Heysens, and many
more. Back again, past the
foyer, which is flanked by
Norman Lindsay’s “Odys-
seus,” and into the Music
Room. But first there is
Gruner’s “Silver Light”
just outside the door. Inside there is
“Apollo’s Vanguard.” Passing out again,
the corridor, just here, is hung with
black-and-white work—Lamberts, Lind-
says and an Unk White drawing, “The
Broken Mask,” which recalls that no
contemporary artist so nearly approaches
Norman Lindsay in the sparkling quality
of his black-and-white work as does
White, The drawing illustrates' at its best
the sheer, sharp, nervous line which this
artist uses with felicity.
Hilder’s “Dora Creek” is opposite the
library door in the corridor. And other

ABORIGINALITIES
“Esk D.’,’: The Drovers’ Ball is in full
jswing at Gongalong. Sally, the rabbiter’s
daughter, is acknowledged belle of the
ball. Dancing with her is Jim Barley,
heir to thousands of acres of wheatland
mortgage. As they drift from the hall
the watchful eyes of several whispering
matrons sitting on the form along one
wall shoot question-marks and asterisks
at their retreating . backs. Comfortably
outside, Jim puts a half-nelson on Sally’s
waist and draws her closer. But Sally
is petulant. “Let’s fix a date for getting
married, Sally,” Jim says. They have
covered this ground before and it has
been productive of argument, “You
know what the old man says about the
difference in our positions,” Sally says
wearily. “It wouldn’t work.” “But it
will,” Jim says, his savoir faire and nine
gin-slings asserting themselves. “I got
on as apprentice to old Rankin today.
He’ll teach me the profession so that I’ll
be able to branch out rabbit-trapping on
my own next winter. That ought to con-
vince your dad that I’m willing and
anxious to better myself and keep you in
the luxury you’re accustomed to. Hang
it all, he had to start from scratch, didn’t
he?” “Oh, Jim,” Sally sighs, and snuggles
to him.

“Wippegong”: Of all signs of autumn
none catches the spirit of the changing
season better than the altered note of
the butcher-bird. In the spring his
urgent song rings with challenge; the
exultant melody of it ever and anon
broken by a peal of harsh defiance to all
and sundry to shape up or shut up.
Wander through his domain and the
snap of his beak is added to the warning
aforesaid, and he seems to spend the
whole mating season with his hackles up.
“ Here’s y'r lunch , Bert; the whistle's just gone."
But now, with the shadows stretching
again, he has grown as mellow as the
season itself. Gone is the passionate
restlessness of the warming days, and in
its place is a smooth, easy song, pitched
lower, sung softer, and breathing of
relaxation and content. Just as the mid-
summer fruits were mostly red, and now
the yellow pears and quinces are with
us, so during the spring and summer the
butcher’s song was aflame, while now it
is pure gold. Attempts have been made,
with indifferent success, to set bird-songs
to music; yet even I, who never really
got past the mouth-organ standard, was
able to extract from the wife’s piano the
song with which the big black-and-white
butcher-bird used to wake us in the
islands. In these days when the toot
of a loco.-whistle or the melody of a
pneumatic-drill seems sufficient founda-
tion around which to build a tune, I
would suggest that the up-and-coming
corqposers who look like getting the
appreciation they deserve pay some at-
tention to the butcher-bird’s autumn song
as a theme for an Australian melody.
Writer hereby offers free guidance any
Sunday morning to location of said song
while it lasts.

“Solitude”: We’d been camped near
the river for a couple of days, but despite
our best efforts to break the monotony
of the menu the fish still went their way.
In vain we swapped our grasshopper bait
for worms, wattle-grubs and crickets;
then Seventyfiver spotted the rabbiter
down-river stalking campward with
shouldered rod and a couple of trout.
After that the old bloke kept an, eye
peeled for the lucky one, and several times
sighted him leaving the stream with his
supper threaded on a small branch.
Then one evening I returned to find
Seventyfiver busily rolling over logs and
turning stones. “Those fish are as good
as caught,” he grinned. “Bin talkin’ to
that rabbiter bloke. Mud-eyes,” he in-
formed'me impressively. “That’s what
he’s gettin’ ’em with. Snifter bait. Y’
get ’em under logs an’ things.” I heaved
up an ancient log and stared at the
assortment of wogs underneath. “What
do these mud-eyes look like?” I inquired,
interested, “Big, small, light, dark,
hoppers, crawlers, or what?” Seventy-
fiver wrestled with a boulder. “Gripes,
Sol, how the blazes would I know what
the damn’ things are like?” he called
back, scratching enthusiastically under
his rock, “I haven’t seen one yet.”

“Betcha”; To all the annoying traits
horses can develop, add the refusal of
some to drink anywhere but their one
accustomed spot. Own an old mare with
the fixed idea that the home dam is the
only place to drink. The water there is
not clean, and though she has the option
of a trough of good drink, she invariably
imbibes at the 4am. Working her
through a long hot day some distance
from home I have driven her belly-deep
into the river, only to wait interminably
while she stands there, ignoring the water.
Several times she has been shut off from
her dam in an adjoining paddock watered
by a clear running creek. Day after day
I found her hanging on the fence, grow-
ing more and more hollow, and pite-
ously imploring everyone who happened
along to let her through. Someone
always did, and the mare at once made
a beeline for her particular bar. If that
dam ever runs dry I can see a weary,
horse-ridden mug lumping kerosene-tins
of water daily to that clay-hole.

“Gravelsnatcher”: A week of sultry
weather followed the driest summer for
60 years, and we studied the skies hourly
for signs of the coming deluge. When
the humidity reached the stage when any
increase must mean rain, I took a look
at the black spider on the back verandah.
She was quite undisturbed by the obvi-
ously approaching storm, and I was won-
dering if i could have been mistaken when
a bright flash preceded some of the most
ominous thunder I’ve ever heard. I
went back then and put it to her: didn’t
she think it, was about time to shorten
sail and take in a few of those loose-
ends? I can’t stand being patronised by
a spider, so I walked away, hoping
that her web would be blown to bits.
The first few drops came down, large
and willing, and the parched earth opened
its pores and spread its surface as the
lightning flashed and the thunder rolled.
“It's time we were off Captain—the passengers are getting impatient."
I made the rounds, seeing that everything
was under shelter, then went inside and
waited —and waited. Five miles away
gale-force winds brought an inch and a
half in half an hour. All we got were
those first few drops and a supercilious
glance from a black spider.

“Hanko”: The quiet of the Sabbath
morn was shattered by an angered voice.
“Who shifted my blasted pipe?” it roared.
We all vowed we’d neither seen nor
touched the thing. The roar developed
into a veritable thundering. Old Rover
crawled under the tank-stand and a white
hen flew screaming over the garden-fence. :
The boss stamped raving from room to
room. “Can’t put a thing down for a
flamin’ minute in this house,” he yelled.
The pampas-grass plumes on the hall-
stand quivered, and a vase tumbled off the
dining-room mantel. Calm as suddenly
returned as the trump pussyfooted out
of the house. I followed him, to find
puffs of blue smoke drifting out of the
smithy. He gave me a sickly grin. “It
was stuck in me hatband,” he said. Back
at the house the womenfolk went blithely
about their preparations for Sunday
dinner; old Rover was begging for scraps
at the kitchen door and the white hen
was scratching happily among the pansies.

“Bo”: Baldy, the off-side leader of
Joe Southwell’s team, had taken the wrong
side round a stump, and the wagon with
four big ironbark logs up had landed
flush in a patch of sand. After half an
hour Joe finished up with a tattered
vocabulary, a badly-relaxed throat and
his wagon in exactly the same resting-
place. With a strangled sort of noise in
his throat he hurled down his now useless
whip; then he wandered slowly up to
Baldy. Putting his mouth up to the
patient bullock’s lug he spoke in a hoarse
voice in which anger had been replaced
by a deep sorrow. “I knew your grand-
father, Baldy—the blankard was so brain-
less he had to have a torch to find his
way around in the daytime. Your old
man was the same —if someone hadn’t
shown him to his feed-box at night the
Alec would’ve starved to death. How
could we expect you to turn out a bloody
Einstein?” And he patted the drooping
Baldy on his iron-hard head and pro-
ceeded to unload.

“E. 2”: “Most cockies are terrible
worriers,” remarked Dan between mouth-
fuls of stew. “They’re always f’rgettin’
somethin’ or rememberin’ somethin’ else
halfway through a job they should be
gettin’ finished, till they’ve got about a
dozen jobs on the go an’ worryin’ over
’em all. Always somethin’ ready t’ go
orf like a shot at mealtimes or in the
night. It’s amusin’ t’ see them cockies
get a sudden attack o’ jitters over things.
Now, my motto is t’ be sure an’ get a
thing done once I start. Nb frettin’ or
worryin’ on this place an’ nothin’ left t’
chance. No broken fences t’ keep me
awake at nights or gates left open t’
’Struth!” Dan jumped up from his tea
and reached for his greasy hat on the
peg. “That reminds me,” he wailed. “I
ain’t too sure if 1 ‘shut that gate into the
clover. If the cows ’ve got in there
the ruddy lot’ll be blown!”

“Old-timer”: Greenie Edwards came
out of the stubble around Brim with a
cheque like a blanket, imbibed fermented
liquors at Beulah’s two pubs, and, thus
fortified, sallied forth into the streets.
An hour later the policeman led him to
the Yarriambiack, pointed across it in
the general direction of Rainbow and
said “Keep goin’. Show your mug round
here again an’ you’ll be shot on sight.”
Greenie wavered across the bridge and,
with drunken cunning, waited in the
scrub until dark, after which he oozed
back into Beulah and reloaded. Some-
where about midnight he flowed down
to the creek and fell into blissful sleep.
Morning came, but Greenie stirred not.
Flies and ants and children on the way
to school inspected him; noon came on
and fell away. He awoke in early
afternoon, sat up and blearily surveyed
the surroundings. Below him twinkled
the serene Yarriambiack, behind him was
a low bank topped with a wire-fence.
Greenie went shakily up the bank and
peered beyond it. He saw a small crowd
of men and, advancing towards him, the
policeman, armed with a d.b. gun. Even
as Greenie’s heart jumped and his ruined
face paled, the policeman raised the gun,
shouted and let drive with both
barrels. Greenie went down that
bank like a diver, waded and swam across
the creek, dashed on to the far shore and
raced for Rainbow and points west.
And, back at the Beulah gun club meet-
ing, the policeman swore, having missed
the galah and thereby lost 30-bob to a
bookmaker.

“Lower Tops’l”: King Island, Bass
Strait, is still the home of brush-wallabies.
A week or so ago the 18 miles of road
leading from Currie Harbor across the
island to the scheelite mine at Grassy
was lined with the furry carcases of these
hoppers killed by trucks. This year the
marsupials are so thick on the large
dairying island that ah all-the-year open
season has been declared. Strange to re-
late, this same brush-wallaby, although
common around Port Jackson in Gover-
nor ■ Phillip’s day, was first described to
science from King Island when the
French naturalists in Baudin’s expedition
were weatherbound at the windswept,
bleak Bass Strait island in 1802.

“Flip”: Mac, the town photographer,
often gets into strife by his habit of sud-
denly jumping to one side, notably when
he does it in the “Royal.” As he wipes
the suds from the waistcoat of his out-
raged neighbor Mac explains: “It’s all
because of a damfool assistant I had in
the old days—a tall bloke who could
never keep his mind on his work. He
was helping me one New Year’s Eve when
Bombina had a big carnival with dancing
in the street, and they wanted me to take
a picture of it. Now when we took photos
at night in those days we used magnesium
powder spread on a tray which had a
long handle so that you could hold it
high above your head and set off the
flash with a trigger on the handgrip.
This cove used to hold the flashlight
while I worked the camera. On the night
of the big shindig I picked a possie on
the landing of the Town Hall fire-escape
and my offsider was down at street-level.
We had two tins of powder in the gun
so she’d light things up good. Finally 1
fixed the camera up and hollered out
from under my cloth ‘All set, Alf. A
voice came up from below that I couu
just pick out over the racket: Right,
Mac.’ Just as I yelled ‘Well, let her
flicker!’ he was doing the final jump m
‘Auld Lang Syne.’ The flash went on
right under my heels and came up throug
the grating like wrong-way lightning.
They reckoned I took off like a swallow,
but I managed to get a beaut aerial sho
of the mob before I hit the roadway, i
still jump every time I think of mm.
THE CAMPFIRES.
You may look in vain for the ashes
Of my campfires lone and apart
Where the girls with the golden sashes
Brought rest to a rover’s heart.
In the calm and the wilder weather
With the bush stars watching above
We shared long nights together
And the great gums shadowed our love.
They showed me the rich red glories
Of the glittering caves they kept,
And told me their fairy stories
Till I swooned at their side and slept.
With arms as warm as a mother’s
They lightened my load of cares;
To these I told and no others
The burden a young life bears.
I told them not glad things only
But a sadness of wild oats sown
And of reckless days and lonely,
And they made my sorrow their own.
I had never a brave endeavor,-
A hope, a doubt, or a fear,
But the campfires keep it for ever
A secret for no man’s ear.
The winds have scattered the ashes
And Time has tidied the ground,
But the girls in the golden sashes
May still in my heart be found.
SCOTLAND.

“Binnacle”; Robinson Crusoe has been
a classic for two centuries, read and loved
all over the world. There is something
fascinating about desert islands and new
lands, and Defoe’s book fascinated in
good measure. But, where Robinson
Crusoe dealt with only one island, the
navigator’s Pilot, that guide without
which no bridge is complete, will take
you on a magic-carpet argosy to every
islet and lagoon, every reef and river and
seaport in the world. The more remote
and unknown it is, the more the Pilot
makes it its business to tell about it.
It is the mariner’s Baedeker. Open a
volume at random, and you see the
dreamy prows of pausing canoes on
tropical lagoons at moonrise ; the glitter-
ing of crowded waves in some rock-set
anchorage; look down from a lonely
navigation mark upon a breezy beach
and watch the white foam flashing
amongst the amber of it; or, as sailors
are not confined to tropic isles, see in the
Pilot’s warning pages a sea like a cauldron
of boiling milk. With its information
compiled by reports from the earliest
navigators, from marine surveyors dis-
patched by the Admiralty to seek and
record information for seamen following
them, and from reports from sea captains
of reefs, currents and bars met in their
steaming, the Pilot, covering the world’s
surface, is the finest and most compre-
hensive travel book written.

“Billy T.”; Some men have the gift of
looking well groomed whatever their en-
vironment ; so have some Trees. Our
camp on Labuan was on a loamy ridge
covered with scrub in which pitcher-
plants and waxy-white orchids grew, and
sloping away to swampy flats that ended
in nipa-palms and Brunei Bay. Those
slopes carried the heaviest growth
around ; rubber plantations almost im-
penetrable through neglect, heavy timber
where the black squirrel scampered and
leapt, vines like octppi, and all stretching,
lurching, clawing for the light—except
for one perfect and dignified tree, a
mangosteen. Although there was a small
clearing to one side and a jungle wall on
the other, this tree was completely sym-
metrical ; from the lowest branches a
yard from the ground to the topmost
tips each limb left the trunk at right-
angles and stayed so, the whole a great
living “beehive” of deep, glossy green.
To climb it one had merely to step into
the branches and walk up ; they were
evenly spaced and strong, so you could
move out along them as on horizontal-
bars to gather the purple fruit drooping
from the tips. This fruit never matured
if picked unripe, so there was keen com-
petition with the few Malays, who also
knew the tree, to be on the spot when
the fruit was prime. Thomas Wood,
during his sojourn amongst Queensland
cobbers, declared the mangosteen the
peerless tropical fruit, and perhaps he is
right. But tell me, ye Aboliars north of
Twenty-eight, do mangosteen-trees in
captivity all bear themselves with the per-
fect poise of my tree in Borneo?

“Dusty Gully”: “Tired Mick reckoned
he’d have t’ give up work in the paddick
on account o’ the way his eyes got
crook,” related Charlie. “His missus was
worried about it, too, an’ packed him orf
t’ the specialist, who couldn’t make it out,
and said Mick’s peepers were in good
nick. But Mick kept on gittin’ the
trouble. It had us all int’rested, an’ we
put it down to some weed or plant his

allergic to. Well, Mick went along t’

tion f’r curin’ anything from ingrowin’

away she tells him t’ work harder an’

ses. ‘I tells the time be the sun.’ ‘Yair,

“B. A. Ker”: Reading Lawson’s “Star
of Australasia” I was amused at the apt
simile “as proud as a boy with a broken
arm.” It is 36 years since I carried my
left wrist in splints and a sling, but I
still recall my chestiness. On returning
to school, however, I was soon deflated.
The rest of Second Class didn’t conceal
their opinion of a piker who had been
away from school for six weeks because
he had a broken arm, then came back
without an arm missing. But to return
to similes ; equally true, if not as well
put, was the one I read somewhere; “As
pathetic as a dog with an injured paw.”
A dog holding up a front paw as he
limps along will evoke sympathy any-
where. Even Hollywood has wakened
up to it —most canine heroes are so
afflicted before their tribulations come to
a happy ending. And the sympathetic
murmurs of the spectators register the
success of the device. But there is an
aspect for which I can’t find a logical ex-
planation. I merely state it as a fact:
In reality or on the screen a dog holding
a front paw up makes a pathetic picture ;
but let him limp along with a back leg
held up and he will receive less sym-
pathy than a homeseeker at an estate-
agency.

“Wonk”: An acute sense of his own
limitations had spared the female com-
munity the attentions of Bob’s homely
phiz, and he’d become almost resigned to
his absence of romance until Backwash
decided to throw a Christmas-party.
Hearing that a large mistletoe was to be
a feature of the affair, the bar crowd
cornered Bob, explained how the flora
worked, and loaded him with prospects
and advice till he grew dreamy and began
to grin. During the next few days he
lapped up instructions and brushed his
spare coat. Interest in his chances ran
high, and the morning after the party the
bar mob waited eagerly to learn the result.
Bob arrived. His face was generously
decorated with scratches, and one eye
was closed. In silence he walked to the
bar and ordered. “All your faults,” he
swung round angrily, “Telling me to sit
under that blarsted mistletoe.” The
accused gathered round and guiltily began
to shout. Not till the old bachelor got
the sixth under his belt did Robbie risk
the all-consuming question. “But, those
scratches. Bob—who caused y’ to get
them?” “Who!” exploded the victim.
“How the blazes do / know who it was
tied the flamin’ great thing up be just
one rotten little strand o’ hayband?”

“Horseless Horseman”; Why did
Nature drape spoonbills in their con-
spicuously white plumage? Whereas
almost all other Australian birds depend
to some extent on their camouflage color-
ing for protection, the whiteness of this
wader stands out like a sail on a sea. Ride
on to any billabong or lagoon and,
despite the presence of hundreds of other
birds, a lone ’bill-crane stalking the
reedy shallows half a mile away catches
your eye immediately. Perhaps it is the
circumstance of this color that makes
this bird at all times so wary and shy.
Even when they’re at roost on trees I’ve
noticed they invariably pick a solitary
dry gum in full view of the landscape,
and then they sleep with one eye open.
I lately saw 16 of these fliers probing
the shallows of Diamond Creek, only 16
miles from Melbourne’s G.P.O.

“Catspaw”: “Macnell” without his rod
and line (B. 24/3/’4B) could have prac-
tised nearer home. Off the sloping
beaches of Frankston (Vic.) the flounder-
fisherman on a flat calm night wade
knee-deep into the water armed with a
6ft. rod and pronged spear. At one
end of the rod is a powerful bulb, at the
other the switch and battery. They stand
still while a flounder, attracted by the
light, glides along just above the sand.
Then a swift lunge, and flounder for
breakfast —if you’re quick enough.
Flounders are not easy to spot. They
change color with their surroundings, and
I once saw a photograph of one that
had been placed in a glass tank with a
chessboard at the bottom. In 15 minutes
that flounder had become part of the
chessboard. Only the tip of one fin gave
him away. I always wanted to put a piece
of tartan into the tank and watch what
happened.

“Mat’s Mate”: We’d hardly dropped
our knots by the bridge when a police-
man appeared and said “No campin’
within two miles o’ the town. Go on,
clear out. There’s bin too much pinchin’
an’ boozin’ an’ hummin’ by you road-
agents round here.” We had a few bob
and plenty of tucker, and didn’t want to
stay near his damn’ town, anyhow, so we
drifted. About ten miles along the road
next day we came upon that policeman,
most of him hidden in the slush of a
table-drain, pinned there by his over-
turned motor-bike and side-car. “You
hurt?” asked Mat. “No, but I can’t get
clear o’ this thing,” gasped the cop.
“Give us a hand, will y’! ” Mat looked
at me and said “Boil the billy, mate,”
Knowing him, I ignored the voice in the
table-drain, gathered sticks and made a
fire. We sat down and had a snack, talk-
ing about this and that and making occa-
sional references to the “funny noises y’
hear in waterholes about here.” The
Law passed from pleas to threats and
back to pleas. After half an hour Mat
kicked the fire out, we swung our knots
and Mat said to nobody in particular
“Well, we better be goin’. Y’ know how
the police are about here. Keep y’
movin’. Too many bots pinchin’ an’
boozin’ about the place. Reckon it’s
about seven miles t’ the next town. Won’t
they be surprised when we tell ’em what’s
in the table-drain?” There was a
struggle as of a giant, a gasp or two and
then “Look. Get me out o’ this an’ y’
can come back an’ camp as long as y’
ruddy well like.” We helped him out,
helped him scrape some of the mud off
and saw him set out back to town.
“Now,” said Mat, “we’ll get into the
scrub an’ head back the way we come,”
An hour later, from a scrubby rise, we
watched a car full of police go tearing
along that road, and we headed further
into the scrub.

“Perseverando”: This year’s Westralian
teams for the north-west were
booked to go by the M.V. Koolinda early
in March. As repairs to the vessel in
Melbourne took a month longer than
expected, some stations chartered planes
to get their men to the job. Teams for
Liveringa and Paradise went this way.
Leaving Guildford airport on Monday,
March 22, at one a.m., they started
work at the former station after lunch
next day after flying 1200 miles and
travelling another 75 by truck. Daylight-
saving is in vogue for the period of the
shearing—all watches have been advanced
an hour. Station premises are also right
up to date—sewered conveniences, mos-
quito-nets for each bed; in fact, all
mod. cons., including a croc.-infested
creek.
CHINESE URN.
A spangled clash of plume and sun
And sparkling colors burn
Creating shades of deeper life
Upon this painted urn.
A bird plucked from the heart of light
Where rainbows soar and stream —
The hand that caught it sleeps in clay
And my hand holds his dream.
And now I see that yellow hand,
That subtle hand that shines
Alive beneath these living tones
Beneath these breathing lines;
And slumbering in this painted eye
Still bright and sharp-defined
Upon the brilliance of the urn
I see that painter’s mind;
And in each golden fleck within
The yellow iris’ gleam
The thoughts from sleep imprisoned lie —
I see that painter’s dream.
Oh, though these wave-like undertones
All glowing as they roll,
If wisdom is in colors’ blend
I see that painter’s soul.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY. I'M SENDING IT OT GRAZCOS."
Dairy Cattle at Sydney.
“J.R.D.”: They were in
greater numbers than ever at
Sydney Show, but there was far
too great a range of quality. It
was particularly noticeable in
Hlawarras, and tended to mar
one of the finest aggregations of
the breed seen in Sydney.
Though the list of ribbon-
winners suggested that three
breeders had the Show to them-
selves, competition was keen
throughout. Parkview, Alne
Bank and Tabbagong paraded
some lovely specimens. The
Dudgeon cattle were wonderfully
prepared, and won both female
championships—it is a long time
since the supreme ribbon went
to a dry cow—Parkview High-
born’s Fussy 77th. The reserve
cow was also from ,ffi e same
family—Fussy 82nd. These cows
are not merely show animals;
test figures they have recorded
are sufficient in themselves to
attract attention.
G. E. Chittick scored well in
both bull and female classes, but
particularly in the former. Last
year’s champion, Bank
Glen, repeated his performance,
although many expected his
stablemate, Alne Bank Anni-
versary, to give him a closer
tussle. Reserve went to a
younger Queensland-bred bull.
Sunny View Royal Locket, who
has scored many triumphs on
the North Coast.
At the sales there was a keen
demand for anything showing
quality, but buyers were not in-
terested in lower-grade stuff that
had patently been brought along
to cash-in on the good market.
Top price at auction was
160gns. for a red-and-white year-
old bull, Parkview Favor. P.
and R. Allan’s Oxleigh Royal
was passed in at 170gns. Demand
for bulls was erratic. Females
sold better and at steady prices.
Ayrshire awards were widely
distributed. There was keen in-
terest in the judging of the bull
championship when F. A. Mc-
Intosh’s imported Castle Clan-
yard Come Along came up
against Pakenham Park Lucky
Lad. The Victorian bull won,
but it was a close finish. Judg-
ing of females attracted a keen
crowd. Top honors went to a
beautiful cow with a big roomy
frame, plenty of style and a well-
shaped udder —Inverurie Mary.
The only fault one could find
was that her teats were on the
short side. Alandale Betty, re-
serve champion, with similar
markings, was full of quality,
but her vessel was not so well
let down. The younger classes
in the Ayrshires were an excel-
lent lot and promise well for the
future. Only a comparative few
Ayrshires were catalogued for
sale, and, although there were
no sensational prices at auction,
they were very satisfactory.
“Jindabyne”; /The Jersey sec-
tion was something of a triumph
for Eddy Graham, N.S.W.
Minister for Agriculture, who
headed a stock-buying expedi-
tion abroad last year and bought
in Canada Bellavista Samaritan

was only beaten by his sire in
Canada, won the Wagga cham-
pionship last year and was Syd-
ney champion, beating the Mel-
bourne R.A.S. champion. C.B.S.

ment Farm, is the answer to a
dairy-cocky’s prayer. The De-
partment had another win in the
Jersey, Golden Conqueror, the
Aberdeen - Angus champion,
Erison of Harviestoun, and the
Percherons, Kilham Commando
and Kilham Jou Jou. In a
splendid showing of Jerseys the
honors were fairly widely distri-
buted, the Kameruka, Navua
and The Meadows stock being
prominent. E. S. Rowntree
collected reserve - bull cham-
pionship with Belgonia Sunray,
and R. Greenaway had the
champion cow. Valley Farm

The golden Guernseys put on
stronger parades than usual, and
were a marked feature in the
daily Grand Parades. E. E.
Cooke, of Richmond River, had
champion and reserve bulls,
Moongi Pleasant Laddie and
Ferndale Golden Sovereign;
C. W. Scott’s Glenoak Morning
Glory was champion cow, with

The “Locust” Industry.
“K.A.S.”: On the North
Coast of N.S.W., from the
Macleay to the Tweed, 10,000
to 12,000 men are engaged, off
and on throughout the year, in
a gigantic soil-erosion project.
Banana plantations in N.S.W.
account for 30,000 acres' out of
an Australian acreage of ap-
proximately 47,000 —almost all
are sited on steeply-rising hill-
slopes to escape winter frosts.
Most are planted in rows
straight up and down the slopes,
so that their mere existence is a
factor in promoting erosion.
The manner of working trebles
their efficiency as murderers of
the topsoil.
Weed-growth is rapid here in
the sub-tropics, and weeds, often
growing 10 feet high, are fatal
to bananas if unchecked. The
three usual methods of control
are brushing, weed-killer spray-
ing and hoe-chipping. Brushing
is an inefficient method of con-
trol, though doing little harm
from the erosion viewpoint.
Spraying and chipping are the
two methods most widely used,
and chipping is much the most
popular, being regarded in addi-
tion as a method of cultivation.
Its effects as an erosion-agent
are terrific.
Plantations are almost invari-
ably chipped up the rows, the
chippers drawing the earth
down-hill behind them. This is
itself a type of dry erosion.
Only the top two inches of the
soil are cultivated. This leaves
it nicely loosened and ready to
be washed down into the gullies
by the next heavy sub-tropical
downpour. As chipping on a
plantation kept clean by the hoe
takes place three or four times
a year, the cumulative effect
may be easily imagined.
Erosion on existing planta-
tions is bad enough, but the ’ex-
pansion of the industry in the
post-war boom makes the prob-
lem more serious still. Virgin
soil is rightly reckoned the best
in which to plant bananas.
Standing scrub, often on hill-
tops, is ruthlessly felled, brushed
and fired. Then in go bananas,
and erosion begins at once.
Virgin sites, however, are now
becoming hard to find, and new
plantations are being laid out
in previously-planted areas. The
difference between these and
virgin-soil plantations of simi-
lar age is sufficient indication of
the erosive effects of banana-
growing.
Best way to combat hillside
erosion is terracing, as in Japan
and Java, It is true
that some growers
“stone - up” the
underside of their
banana - stools and
make use of logs
lying at right-angles
to the slopes. Taken
as a whole, however,
terracing is frag-
mentary and ineffec-
tive, Overall con-
trol of the right kind
is urgently required.
Terracing should be
compulsory on all
plantations, wi t h
Government direc-
tion and assistance.
Deep digging o r
ploughing,, already
used to a small ex-
tent, done once
yearly should be-
come the standard
practice. This real
cultivation would
eliminate much hoe work, and if
weeds were kept down as much
as possible by spraying chipping
might be kept to a minimum.
Poor, inaccessible and uneco-
nomic plantations ought to be
compulsorily acquired and de-
stroyed. In addition to control-
ling erosion this would reduce
present excessive acreage. Plant-
ing permits should be controlled
and limited.
The industry, like a great
locust, is eating the heart out of
the rich North Coast hillslopes.
Banana-growing is worth saving
—last year its output was worth
nearly £3,000,000, and it directly
supported over 30,000 people.
But it is not worth keeping on
its present terms. The banana
industry is valuable, but not in-
dispensable. It is a temporary
form of agriculture—plantations
rarely last more than 15 years.
It has no export trade. Its proper

place is that of an efficient,
organised and limited minor in-
dustry. Otherwise it may as well
be destroyed, bananas imported
cheaply and the slopes planted
with timber.
The Calf Shelter.
“Myrrhee”: A portable shel-
ter open on one side is better
than a shed on a fixed site. The
closed side can be turned against
prevailing winds or changes of
weather. Pollution, obvious
around any fixed calf-shed site,
is overcome. The shelter needs to
be well-floored with straw and
cleaned every day or so. Lime
sprinkled liberally around inside
and out helps to keep the place
sweet, and a spraying with a
2i p.c. D.D.T. solution on
walls, floor and ceiling every
couple of months will eliminate
flies. Half a pound of an
aqueous suspension of D.D.T.
warmed and melted to liquid
form and stirred into one gallon
of water produces a 2\ per cent,
solution, enough to cover 125
square yards. Calf paddocks
are best near the cowshed, with
the feeding-bails at the closest
point. These needn’t be roofed,
but should have an impervious
floor with a concrete approach.
Wintering Bees.
“Bumble”: Begin early, while
the weather is warm enough for
ripening honey, to prepare the
colonies for winter. It’s essential
that each colony has ample
stores to carry it through till
spring blossoms provide enough
nectar for hive requirements.
Less honey will be consumed
when the hives are in good order
and well-stocked, for it’s a slow
conductor of heat, and the
natural warmth of the clustered
bees isn’t dissipated, nor is it
necessary for the bees to gorge
to generate sufficient warmth.
There is no hard-and-fast rule
for the amount of stores a hive
should have for winter ; it varies
considerably with localities, and
local conditions should be
studied. Err on the generous
side, for any above requirements
is preserved in the hives. Weak
colonies may need helpings of
sealed combs of honey to see
thetn through. If these aren’t
available feed sugar-syrup inside
the hives as fast as the bees can
store and seal it. Syrup is made
by stirring together equal parts
by measure of white sugar and
water at boiling point.
In cold climates there should
be adequate protection against
frost, and there is no better in-
sulation than newspaper. Several
folds may be packed in between
the top of the frames and hive
covers. Nuclei colonies should
be crowded by use of division
boards and packed in snugly.
Restrict entrances to a couple
of inches with lightly-nailed
boards.
Care for the Saw.
“Herbert”: Take care oi
hand and crosscut saws. Keep
a can of special oil —sperm-oil
is ideal —handy. After using the
saw scour it clean with fine
emery cloth, wipe it well and oil
it. It will cut faster and with less
labor and requires less set. Saws,
when new, have the proper
hook-shape of the teeth. A
ripsaw is nearly straight
(plumb) up and down the front
of the teeth. The crosscut saw
has the front of the teeth slop-
ing well back from the root of
the tooth to its point. Keep
the teeth on that slope. A rip-
saw should be filed square
(straight) across the front of the
teeth, with the handle of the file
lowered from two to three
inches, giving a bevel to the top
of the teeth. A thick blade re-
quires more bevel than a thin
one. The best file to use for
eight-, seven-, six-, five- and
four-point saws is a six-inch
slim taper file and a five-inch
slim taper file for nine-, 10- and
12-point saws. Use a good
handle and set the file straight
and firm in the handle. Don’t
try to straighten a buckled saw
on the anvil with a hammer. If
you do every blow will stretch
the saw and ruin it for good
work. Use a mallet on the an-
vil, or, better, use a block of
timber cut off straight and planed
smooth. Hammer the kinks out
on the planed end of the block.
Hints for the Farm.
“Ned”: If a few fence-posts
rot off at ground-level and re-
placement isn’t an easy matter
at the moment, don’t bother
staking the posts if the wires are
taut. Root out some clods of
soil and grass and pack them,
mound fashion, around the
broken post up to bottom-wire
level. Unless the weather is
very dry the grass will keep on
growing and the post will remain
upright and serviceable for a
year or two longer. Brush
sump-oil on to posts before
erecting them. It is a better pre-
servative than tar.
“W. Court”: As far as pos-
sible, chaff made from native
grasses, cane-tops, etc., and left
exposed to the air, should be
used as soon as possible. This is
especially necessary if the forage
was wet when chaffed, as under
warm, humid conditions. The
heap rapidly develops heat, and
fungus growth works upwards
from the base of the mass,
“cementing” the chaff into grey-
ish or reddish lumps. This
fungoid material is so toxic that
a few ounces are sufficient to kill
any horse or cow.
“Wilco”: Every large-sized
molasses storage tank ha.s a
“breather plug” in the lid. When
the lid is put in its place it is
important that the plug should
be pulled out. If it is not, great
expansion of the molasses under
hot-weather conditions may
burst the tank'. Small tanks
which lack breather plugs
should not have the .lids put on
tightly,
“Myrr”: L. A. Downey, Vic-
torian pig expert, says about 25
p.c. of all pigs bom don’t sur-
vive the first month, probably
because of cold. What they
need is a cosy, dry sty and a
creep filled with straw under
which they can retire when fed.
“Bill C.”: Brushes are ruined
by improper handling. Keeping
them in a hot place causes
shrinkage in the wood, which
causes the bristles to fall out.
Letting them stand on the
bristles for even a few minutes
will cause damage. Before using
a new paint-brush mb out loose
bristles and dust and then soak
the bristles in water for a few
minutes. The brush is now
ready for use. When the job is
finished, suspend the brush in
water or turpentine. The bristles
should be completely immersed,
but they must not be allowed
to touch the bottom of the ves-
sel so that the brush stands on
end.
“Plane Creek”: To keep lice
away from caged birds suspend
a small cloth bag of sulphur in
the cage. There is no need to
sprinkle sulphur on the birds.
“Myrr”: If citrus leaves be-
come mottled with yellow
patches it’s safe to assume zinc
deficiency. Try a spray of zinc
sulphate 20z., hydrated lime loz.
and water 4gal. The leaves can
absorb the zinc, whereas' the
roots are often incapable of do-
ing so.
“F.L.”: Paint-tins, discarded
batteries and other refuse con-
taining prepared chemicals
shouldn’t be left around for
stock to lick or chew. Deaths
have been caused by them. Salt
or mineral deficiencies may
cause animals to seek their needs
in rubbish dumps, etc.

Over £4,000 From a £l,OOO Life Policy
An amazing assurance policy designed for a man with young children.
Whjen a widow is left with
small children, an immediate
£l5O, plus bonuses, is a great
help.
While growing children are
needing so many things, there
is a guaranteed income of £l3
each month.
When the children are self-
supporting, there is still a
further £l,OOO paid to the
widow in a lump sum.
The Mutual Life & Citizens’
Assurance Company Limited
(Incorporated in N.S.W.)
FOUNDED 1886
THE M.L.C.
The M.L.C.’s “AM/20” (Family Income Policy) gives your family
three things in case of your death. As an example, consider a Policy
for £l,OOO. Here are the actual figures.
1. It pays your dependants an immediate £l5O, plus whatever
bonuses have been earned. This would look after your family’s
current debts.
2. It pays your family £l3 a month for the remainder of the period
until 20 years after the commencing date of the Policy.
3. It pays your family the *full £l,OOO at the end of the 20 year
period.
What it means to you: Your family gets protection while it needs it most. Your
children will be grown-up and independent in 20 years’ time. In the meantime,
there is a guaranteed income. In addition there is the full £l,OOO payable at
the end of the term.
Taxation Saving: Did you know the Government gives you an Income Tax rebate
up to £lOO a year for Life Assurance premiums you pay?
AN ACTUAL CASE of the M.L.C.’s “AM/20”
Policy No. 615,144 was taken out Ist December, 1937, for a monthly premium
of £2/10/8. The Policy was for £l,OOO, Table AM/20. The Policyholder died
on 7th April, 1942, on which date there became payable an immediate £215/5/9.
SO THAT FAMILY’S
CLEAN-UP FUND WAS
£215/5/9
From 7th April, 1942, there became payable £l3 a month until 20 years from
commencing date of the Policy. Last monthly cheque for £l3 will be paid
7th November, 1957, making 157 monthly cheques each of £l3, totalling £2,431.
SO THAT FAMILY’S INCOME
WILL AMOUNT TO
£2,431
On Ist December, 1957, the full amount of the Policy will become payable,
namely £l,OOO, plus the last portion of a month’s income (from Bth November,
1957, to Ist December, 1957). The final cheque will be £l,OlO/8/-.
SO THAT FAMILY GETS A
FINAL PAYMENT OF
£ l,OlO/8 /-
TOTAL PAYABLE ON THIS £l,OOO POLICY £3,656/13/9.
SUMMARISED: An M.L.C. “AM/20” Policy for £l,OOO will give your
family AT LEAST £l,OOO plus bonus; BUT IT CAN GIVE over
£4,000. It means that a man with a wife and young children can
make certain his widow gets an income during the years she needs
it to bring up his children; and she ALSO gets a big lump sum when
the children are grown-up. It is well worth you writing for the details
and considering it for your family’s protection.

“Well, you shouldn’t be so
long-winded.”
Reluctantly, David held the
gate open.
“Well, walk slowly, then,” he
begged, and, hastening the tempo
of his delivery, he took up the
tale again: “So when I put the
big lemon in my mouth, Tony
took his out and grabbed a
big one, too, and put that in,
and then”
"FHE front door burst open

ing as he saw Mrs. Noyse,
“Mummie, d’ you know what?

her mouth and Mrs. Baker pulled
it out with a bottle-opener.”
There was a wail of despair
from David.
“There! I said he’d tell you

over, opened his mouth and
joined in the chorus. With this
joyous accompaniment sur-
rounding her, Mrs. Noyse went
through to the back of the house,
where she found Patricia red-
faced and red-eyed.
“Are you all right?” she
asked.
“Yes, Mummie.”
“Why did you do such a silly
thing?”
“Well, the boys were doing it
and I thought I’d try. But my
lemon must have been bigger
than theirs.”
At this the two boys ceased
their howling abruptly to voice
a joint protest; “It was not.
It wasn’t nearly as big.”
Mrs. Noyse sprang to the de-
fence of her sex.
“I should think not! ” she
said. “Patricia’s mouth’s , a
mouth, not a rabbit-trap like
yours.”
But Patricia was not looking
for flattery. She wanted justice.
“It was a big lemon,” she in-
sisted. “The biggest in the
basket.”
“I’ll tell you what it was,
Mummie,” said David, “It
wasn’t a very big lemon. It
was just that she put it in her
mouth in the wrong way. I’ll
show you.”
He picked up a lemon from
the basket, which was standing
on the kitchen table.
“See. Instead of putting it
in end . first, like this” —he
demonstrated the correct action
for putting a lemon in the
mouth —“she put it in crooked,
like this.” The lemon dis-
appeared into his mouth and his
bulging cheeks showed the
accuracy of his demonstration.
“That’s how Patricia did it,”
said Tony approvingly, and
David’s eyes glowed with
triumph changed to a look of
panic. His lips parted, reveal-
ing the yellow of the lemon-peel.
He made a queer, gurgling
noise and tried to get his fingers
into his mouth, but the effort
was useless.
“Now he knows what I felt
like,” observed Patricia heart-
lessly.
Mrs. Noyse, confronted with
a situation she had never before
had to cope with, was momen-
tarily at a loss.
“Can’t you open your mouth
wider?” she asked.
THE gurgling took on a note
of rage, which was suffi-
cient reply.
Tony, the man of action, lost
no time. He was at the dividing-
fence, calling out: “Mrs. Baker!
Bring out the bottle-opener.
David’s swallowed one.”
Mrs. Noyse was endeavoring
to calm David so that she could
take proper stock of the situa-
tion and decide what measures
were called for. The lemon was
obviously stuck sideways across
his mouth, and she felt that if
she could in some way twist it
round endways she would be
able to get it out. But David
did 4 not seem prepared to co-
operate ; instead he gave the
impression of suspecting her of
an intention to push the lemon
down his throat. He struggled
to keep her hands away from
his mouth, and insofar as the
obstruction permitted continued
to give vent to a series of gurg-
ling squawks.
In response to Tony’s SOS
Mrs. Baker came in from next
door, armed with a large cork-
screw—the bottle-opener of
Tony’s narrative.
“Let me try, Mrs. Noyse,” she
said. “I think I can manage it.”
Mrs. Noyse stood aside and
David, apparently willing to
trust his case to an expert of
whose skill he had already had
visual evidence, calmed down
and turned to Mrs. Baker.
“That’s what she used on
mine,” said Patricia as Mrs.
Baker commenced operations
with the corkscrew.
Her method was simple. Hold-
ing David’s face with her left
hand, she twisted the corkscrew
into the peel of the lemon, with-
drew it and squeezed hard. A
quantity of juice oozed out. She
repeated the process three or
four times until she had ex-
tracted much of the juice of the
lemon, then, partly by probing
with the corkscrew and partly
with her fingers, she twisted the
lemon around and out it came.
AFTER Mrs. Baker had gone
home from her second errand
of mercy a relative calm de-
scended upon the Noyse house-
hold. Mrs. Noyse busied her-
self with the evening meal and
Patricia and David began an
interesting comparison of the
somewhat dehydrated lemons
that had been the cause of their
discomfiture. Richard unearthed
the egg-beater and began to play
kettle-drums with the sauce-
pans.
As a result of all this no one
heard the front gate click except
Tony, who had posted himself
at the front window to await
his father’s arrival home. He
darted to the front door and
greeted his father with:
“Daddy, d’you know what?
Patricia and David got a lemon
stuck in their mouth. The silly
things. D’ you know what they
did? Well, instead of putting it
in straight, like I did, they put
it in crooked, like this.”
He pulled a lemon out of his
pocket and a moment later Mr.
Noyse was confronted with a
similar spectacle to the one his
wife had seen a short time be-
fore. His reaction was bad. So,
for that matter, was Tony’s. The
memory of two successful opera-
tions on his sister and brother
did not help him in the least to
bear his own burden. His terror
was every bit as strong as
David’s had been; the gurglings
much stronger.
“Quick!” Mr. Noyse called
to his wife, “the kid’s choking.
Where are you? Get a doctor.
Do something!”
He seized Tony and tried to
get his finger into his mouth.
Tony struggled free as Mrs.
Noyse and the others came on
flip cppnp
“Don’t stand there doing no-
thing,” said Mr. Noyse. “What
are you grinning at? He’s
choking. He’s swallowed a
lemon.”
“That’s nothing to worry
about,” replied Mrs. Noyse.
“David, get the corkscrew.”

Quite Open.
“The Communist Rowe, when
arrested after being a hunted fugitive
from justice for eight days, boasted
that he had gone about openly. Dur-
ing his flight Communist speakers in
the Sydney Domain declared that he
was in hiding.”
The Rats were gathered in
humorless conclave to welcome
back the Hero of the Great
Strike,
“And you succeeded for days
in outwitting the police minions
of the capitalistic exploiters,
Comrade, even without the
necessity of resorting to subter-
fuge, hiding or surreptitious
sorties only at night?” asked the
Chief Rat.
The Hero’s chest expanded to
its full 28 inches. “It was as
easy as that, Comrades,” he
boasted.
“Quite openly, when I heard
I was to be arrested, I left my
hotel by the fire-escape. Not
that I was afraid to go out the
front door. In the interests of
the workers I felt it my duty to
test the efficacy of their fire-
escape equipment for myself.
“The garage housing my car
was two hundred yards
away. I merely strolled there,
taking as long as twenty-five
seconds to cover the distance. I
wept to a garage, filled up on
the special issue that is always
guaranteed from Canberra while
we are directing major strikes
against a State, and drove
away. Except for my hat being
pulled down to my brows, my
overcoat collar tucked up to my
eyes and that I was wearing
smoked glasses, my face wasi
quite open to be seen by any
police-pimp.
“I drove all that night and
all next day slept in a dog-ken-
nel just over the border. But
thip was through no fear of the
law, which our party rightly
holds in contempt.” (“ ’Ear,
’ear!”) “It was because sleep-
ing in dog-kennels during day-
light hours invariably gives me
a sense of wellbeing—it is the
only way I can get relief from
ingrowing hairs. When the
owner found out who I was he
insisted on swilling out the ken-
nel with strong disinfectant be-
fore he’d allow his kelpie to go
in it The capitalistic
swine! I’ve taken his name, and
when Moscow gives us the green
light for the revolution of the
proletariat here we’ll see that
he”
“Yes, yes, Comrade,” broke
in the Chief Rat. “I suppose
you.just beat his boot to the car
and got away. You went to
Sydney by the main highway?”
“No. I could have, of course.
Remember, I was then in Mc-
Girr’s State, and a Communist
strike-leader there, no matter
what he does, is safer — very
much safer, in fact —than he
would be in Moscow. But the
fact is I went, quite openly, by
the back roads. Mind you,
the thought that I’d strike
fewer police that way never
once entered my head. But
the only exercise I’d had
since the strike began was
pulling my braces on of a morn-
ing, waving my arjns for a few
minutes on a soap-box in front
of the mugs and wielding a
knife and fork in five-course
meals at Brisbane’s best hotels.
Gliding along a smooth high-
way in my limousine would
afford me no exercise. So I
thought that by jogging over
badly-corrugated roads my liver
would get the necessary shak-
ing-up to put it in good shape.”
“On reaching Sydney I found
the twenty-guinea suit I was
wearing needed dry-cleaning, so
I got around in a pair of en-
gineer’s old overalls. Fancy a
leading Communist got up as a
worker! ”
At these words, which he sus-
pected might contain a joke, the
Chief Rat looked around
sharply. But there was no
treachery to Communist “prin-
ciples” or to the great god Joe,
for not a face contained even
the vestige of amusement.
“I must, quite unconsciously,
fiave wiped quite a lot of grease
over my face when I put the
overalls on,” the Hero pro-
ceeded. “It’s a wonder the
dopey police didn’t recognise me,
though. Mind you, I had
changed the swagger in my
police description to a slow
crawl, but this was really to con-
serve my strength in case I had
to fight several police at once.
During the days in Sydney I
used to stand between a couple
of Wirth’s elephants just over
in Exhibition Park from A.E.U.
headquarters in Chalmers-street.
Why the police didn’t think of
looking for me there I can’t
imagine.
“Coming back it was the
same. Going out to Mascot at
night I wound a scarf right
around my face —that’s because
I’m allergic to night air. But
even though I simply flaunted
myself at them all the time the
brutal police didn’t come near
me! ”

had raised the clenched fist to
the photo pf Joe on the wall and
were about to pass a resolution
of confidence in their friends
Chifley and EVatt a small boy
passing outside blew a shrill
blast on a new football whistle.
Without even waiting to burn
the latest secret orders from the

Hero and the rest of the Rats
showed their deep contempt for
the law by diving for their funk-
holes.

Hospital Bills
What does the six-guineas-a-week
charge of private hospitals pay for? I’ve
just returned from a spell at one and
find that the set fee is only part of the
expenses.
Extras included theatre fee of two
guineas, injections at 10s. 6d. a time, not
to mention the usual capsules, tablets and
medicine. Even a humble dose of castor-
oil was on the list. Toilet-paper was
down at 2s. 6d. and metho, for back-
rubbing, the same.
I was on an orange-juice diet for three
days, yet, though all my food was saved
during that time, my family had to pro-
vide the oranges. Eggs, also necessary,
had also to be brought, and I had been
asked before admission to bring my own
tea and butter, not the coupons, but the
food itself.
I thought the charge of 10s. fqr hire
of a reading-lamp was bad enough until.
1 read the last item on the list —a local
phone-call telling my family that I was
ready to come home. It read “Phone,
Is.”— Urana (N.S.W.).
Specialists
It requires more than “R.W.’s” state-
ment (B. 24/3/’4B) to prove that it is
ridiculous for an A.A.M.C. colonel to
rank higher than an infantry major. If
the major were a patient in the colonel’s
unit he would be under the command of
the A.A.M.C. officer, and there’s noth-
ing particularly ridiculous about that.
Otherwise they probably would have
nothing to do with one another.
The idea of having “executive officers”
to run a medical unit wouldn’t work.
Each arm and service must be officered
by men trained in its particular duties'.
In the last war we found a. women’s
specialist (Major-General Maguire) and
a children’s specialist (the late Major-
General Downes) holding the appoint-
ment of Director-General of Medical
Services. There is no evidence that they
were “playing at soldiers” any more than
two combatant doctors. Major Powell,
2 i/c of a tank-attack regiment, or the
late Brigadier Lind, a brigade com-
mander, fought their actions with
stethoscopes.—Ex-A.A.M.C. (Q.).
Soldiers
Most of Australia’s decorated war
heroes, and practically all the V.Cs., were
pobr “parade-ground” soldiers, despite
the claim \by “Vacco” (B. 24/3 / ’4B).
They learnt their discipline the hard way
—when it meant the difference between
life and death and not two hours’ spud-
cleaning.
The old bullring was all right in its
place. Although it taught marching and
general bearing, it never made the
“dinkum soldier.” It made a raw recruit
into a tin soldier who lacked initiative
and could hardly think for himself. If
his officer went he went, too.
Campaigns made soldiers. They made
them keen, sharp-eyed and cunning, and
taught them to trust nobody. These
factors made the dinkum soldier. None
of them came from the bullring where
a sergeant-major shouted from dawn till
dusk, — Waddlin’ Willie (Vic.).
The Master Plan
On exhibition in Sydney is the “Master
Plan for the Town Planning of the
County of Cumberland.” Very little has
been said about it, although the plan,
vitally affects thousands of working-class
property-owners, and if carried into effect
is likely to involve them in heavy financial
loss and untold worry. Introduction of
“interim plans” some time ago caused
the “freezing” of vast areas in which
many working-class people had acquired
building allotments. The owners were
unable to go on with their plans for home-
building, and were unable to dispose of
their holdings for the good and sufficient
reason that no one would buy them.
It now transpires that many of these
building allotments are in areas that have
been incorporated in “green belts” and
“open spaces” and will prove a big loss
to the owners. True, the owners will be
compensated, but on what basis and
when is not stated. Judging by prece-
dents, the owners will get nothing near
the amount they have already sunk into
the places. The Valuer-General’s valu-
ation is likely to be the basis, and to
secure any increase on this will almost
certainly mean recourse to the Land and
Valuation Court, which is beyond the
average working man.
A stated objective of the master-plan
is to compel prospective builders to fill
up the “gaps” that have been left in
the areas already well developed. It is
estimated that many thousands of build-
ing blocks remain vacant in intensely-
developed suburbs. Maybe, but what
stops the working-class builder from
settling on these blocks is the cost —the
lower cost was one of his main reasons
for going-to the outer suburbs in the first
place.
Many home sites have been lumped in
factory and industrial areas. The fore-
sight of the prospective homeowner who
obtained land near a railway or main
highway may now be his downfall, since
areas handy to transport and other ser-
vices have been reserved for industrial
purposes.
An inspection of the vast array of
maps, diagrams and charts may well lead
one to wonder if the town-planners ever
inspected the districts they so lightly dealt
with on paper. In one area a projected
railway runs directly across a residential
area now being rapidly developed by
working-class families. No-station is pro-
posed on the line, it being a link between
“Two meat-pies, two cream-puffs, two rock-cakes, two ice-creams —and
you can keep any change."
two routes running parallel a mile or so
apart. Just why the planners should elect
to drive through the heart of that little
residential district is something only they
can explain.
The master-plan is to be on view
till July, when it will be presented by
the Cumberland County Council to
the Minister of Local
who will exhibit it for a further
three months. During that time property-
owners who wish to do so may lodge
objections, firstly with the Cumberland
County Council, and, later, with the
Minister of Local Government. They
shouldn’t hesitate. — Jindivick (N.S.W.).
Mudbrick Houses
Because "of the acute shortage of ortho-
dox building materials, housing authori-
ties all over Australia have suddenly be-
come interested in the sun-dried mud-
brick, making exhaustive laboratory tests
and so forth.
To take a mudbrick to a scientific
laboratory to be tested is like taking two-
and-two-is-four to the university for pro-
fessors to contemplate. After a few
weeks a mudbrick wall which has been
laid in mud plaster becomes a monolith,
and the amount of pressure it will with-
stand when in that state is enormously
greater than the individual brick will
take. The wall becomes so solid that it
takes a pick and crowbar to make any
impression on it, and a doorway drivsn
through a wall requires no support what-
ever.
In my district, 14 miles from Melbourne,
a mudbrick cottage 98 years old was
recently demolished to make way for a
modern dwelling. The bricks that came
out of the walls were so good that I
could only get them at a price.
Yet our local council still wants evi-
dence that the mudbrick is as suitable a
material as concrete, wood, fibro-cement
or the kiln-dried brick. And the C.S.I.R.
is sending an expert to Europe, although
there are dozens of modern mudbrick
houses around Melbourne which have
been built out of the earth taken from
their foundations.— Bumpkin (Vic.).
“Higher Education”
“Shirley’s” remarks (B. 19/11 /’47) are
too sweeping. Not only the smarter
children make a success of professional
careers. I was a country girl in Queens-
land with small chance of acquiring
“higher education.” A poor-all-round
pupil and hopeless at maths, I was never-
theless permitted by my State-school-
mistress to try for one of the yearly
Grammar School scholarships—the only
road to the higher education for the
masses then. Her gruelling coaching
brought me a pass, and my surprised
parents made sacrifices to give me two
terms at Grammar, after which funds
petered out and I came home, and stayed
there until financial reverses-sent me to
a relative in N. S. Wales and to school
again.
I still knew more about separators than
textbooks. I’d never got the hang of
study, and, if I had an ambition, it was
to go for a walk with the boy next-door.
Yet they decided I was to be a teacher
and I found myself, dud as I was, among
some of the smartest girls in the State,
allegedly studying for a competitive exam,
for admission to what was then the only
high school. It was pretty tough, to me.
On the day of the exam. I’d have
scored 100 per cent, for hysteria easily.
But when results came out I was in by
the skin of my teeth. From high, on
through training college and out to teach,
my career was successful, thanks to my
teachers, who always had to work hard
with me as I plodded from the bottom to
the top. One case -like this might not
prove that we are gaining much from
“higher education” for alfi but it does
suggest what good teaching can force
out of an unpromising pupil.— Ex-
Teacher (N.S.W.).
Comrade Sharkey
Comrade Sharkey, from India: “Out-
side the hotels; where the ‘respectable’
imperialists live wait the rickshaw-
pullers whose life energies are expended
in a few .years. Imagine a fat British
imperialist being dragged at a trot in the
blazing Indian sun by a skinny beast of
burden weighing perhaps nine stone.”
In years spent in and out of India I’ve
yet to see a fat Briton, imperialistic or
otherwise. Rickshaw-boys, like nearly
all Indians, certainly are thin —and hard
as a rail and tough as whipcord. I’ve
pulled a rickshaw, and in Indian city
streets the perfectly-balanced, rubber-
tyred vehicle absorbs about as much effort
as my young brother’s billy-cart. Many
more Indians than British use their
national taxi.
The reason Comrade Sharkey was be-
sieged by rickshaw-boys is that they ex-
pected, being British, or at least white,
he’d tip them. Of course, Comrade
Sharkey would choke on imperialistic
food in a hotel; where did he sleep?—
Conda (N.S.W.).
N.Q. Cattle Country
“Alpha” (B. 24/3/’4B) is wrong when
he says Cajpe York Peninsula and the
rest of N.Q. is only breeding country and
will not fatten cattle. Admittedly, at
the end of the six-months dry season
cattle are dog-poor, the country is
usually burned-out for miles and in most
places surface water is scarce. But three
weeks after the first thunderstorms—
usually early in December —the cattle
are mud-fat. In January prime bullocks
can be sold off countiy of which a month
before one square mile would have been
needed to keep a dozen beasts alive.
That speaks volumes when it is re-
membered no ringbarking is done, there
is no water-conservation and no intro-
duced grasses are planted. Tens of thou-
sands of square miles are in exactly the
same state as when the first settlers saw
them 70-odd years ago. Yet cattlemen
there are well off, and several proper-
ties on the Peninsula turn out
a thousand head, and over, of prime
bullocks every year. That period of
quick fattening is the reason. It can be
depended on, for the wet season has
never been known to fail. What would
some southern cattlemen give to have six
months’ fattening period on which they
could depend every year!
The biggest handicap is the 500-
odd miles of droving over a stock-
route without regular water supplies
to the trucking yards and meatworks at
Mareeba. Saleyards, to handle 5000 head
at a time, will soon be functioning there.
A meatworks at Cooktown, on the
Peninsula itself, would be a great help
to cattlemen in those parts. —G. L P. (QJ.
Beer and Smokes
With recollections of tobacco queues
and the shortage of grog I was surprised
to read in a compendium of Australian
Statistics, dated December, 1947, the fol-
lowing figures for “Consumption per
capita of beer and tobacco—Australia”:
Beer. Tobacco.
1938-39 .. 12.13 gals. 3.341 b
1943-44 .. 13.00 „ 3.45 „
1945- .. 13.45 „ 3.32 „
1946- .. 15.94 „ 3.88 „
Enlarging on the bare statistics, the
compendium states that in 1945:46
total consumption figures were; Beer
99,670,957 gallons, tobacco 24,721,8281 b.
For 1946-47: Beer 119,538,464 gallons,
tobacco 29,109,4961 b.
Twenty million gallons more beer and
five million pounds more tobacco should
go a long .way towards alleviating alleged
shortages. Where is the stuff going to?

can send it up to 30 miles for Is. 6d., but
if its journey runs to, say, 35 miles and
a State boundary intervenes, it will cost
3s. 6d. For one penny-more (3s. 7d.) he
can send it all the way to England (12,000
miles), or 5000 miles to South Africa for
3s. 2d. ;
There is a catch if his fancy is for
North America —3s. 9d. to the U.S.A.,
4s. 9d. to British Canada! Finally, if
he is wavering between a land journey
across the Australian continent (2600
miles) and a sea trip across the Tasman
(1300 miles), let him be warned that the
first will cost five-bob, and the second
only 2s. lid.
The P.M.G. might well devote some of
his astronomical annual profit to giving
a flat-rate of parcel postage anywhere in
Australia. — Hist (N.S.W.).
Incentive Payments
When “Vesab” (B. 24/3/’4B) praises
the efficiency of the bonus system and
incentive-payments in industry, he must
remember that his brother-employees
are among the few who possess sufficient
commonsense to ignore trade-union policy
and be paid for what they are worth.
Although many industrial critics claim
the present lag in production is caused
by the shorter working week, they
forget the huge potentialities of incentive-
payments. Countries which have intro-
duced the system are leaving Australia
far behind.
For years such schemes have been
favored by employers ; they were ready to
be introduced into the country’s post-war
industry and would be operating but for
the Communist-controlled A.C.T.U.
At last year’s A.C.T.U. congress
Communists (well in the majority) suc-
cessfully sponsored a move to reject the
schemes in their entirety despite the assur-
ance by the executive to Chifley that it
would “examine” the possibility of their
use in Australia.
Workers should ignore the A.C.T.U.
ruling and signify their intention of
accepting bonus payments for work done.
—W. W. (Vic.).
“American Radicals”
W- H. Chamberlin (B. 3/3/’4B) was
forgetful of the history of his country
when he wrote in the “Wall Street
Journal”;
There have been a good many American
radicals and rebels from the Revolution to
the 20th century. But it has never been
the mark of an American radical in the
past to be slavishly subservient to a foreign
Power.
When the French Revolutionists were
at issue with England and her allies the
American radicals of the time behaved
exactly as their twentieth-century counter-
parts are doing. In the interest of their
French friends they adopted a tone of
violent hostility towards England.
Presidents Washington and Adams,
who had no time for the French Revolu-
tion nor any desire to embroil their coun-
try with England, were embarrassed by
this agitation, which won considerable
support. One French Minister to the
U.S.A., who openly intrigued in American
politics, was treated by radical Americans
with sickening adulation.
When Napoleon became master or
France their admiration was transferred
to him. Eventually their influence was
an important factor in bringing about
President Madison’s declaration or war
against England—the war of 18
Hist’oricus (N.S.W.).


Hilders. And Blamire Young. Near
this end of the first floor there is a
stained-glass window designed by Nor-
man Carter and paid for by Hinton, the
subject being “Learning.” On the
ground floor there is a similar window,
“Athletics.”
Facing each other, more or less, are
the Women’s Club and the Lecture Hall.
The Women’s Club is a cosy, bright,
feminine place with comfortable chairs
and, naturally, pictures. They are:
“The Elect” by Norman Lindsay, “Fish
for Scarborough” by Arthur Burgess,
“Roses” by Alessie Kane, “Zinnias” by
R. W. Phillips, “My Grandmother” by
Harold Abbott (presented by the Society of
Artists), “Glass, Fruit,” by Alessie Kane,
“Sunny Corner, Elanora Golf , Club” by
Robert Johnson, “Flood Waters” by John
Rowell, “Patterson’s River at Hinton” by
R. Wakelin, “Ploughing at Hinton” by R.
Wakelin, “Spring” by Charles Lloyd Jones,
“Mrs. Home Drummond” by Louis Busiere,
“The Motor Plough” by Kenneth Mac-
queen, “Shearing Shed” by Robert Johnson,
“Tulips” by Arthur Murch, “Girl and
Fawn” by Arthur Murch, “Lupins and
Snapdragons” by Eric Wilson, “Gladioli
and Lilies” by Arthur Murch, “Crimson
and Green” by Janos Czencz, “Hyde Park,
Sydney” by H. Badham, , “Moonstone
Polishers” by Fred Leist, “The Model” by
H. Hanke, a portrait of Dame Mary Gil-
more (donated by Dame Mary Gilmore to
the Ed. Dept.), “The Gale” by J. Muir
Auld, “London Coster Girl” by Fred Leist,
“Firelight” by Fred Leist, “Holiday Camp”
by K. Macqueen, “The Tryst” by Norman
Lindsay, “A Woodland Stream” by P. J.
Naftel and “The Poplars” by Isobel Mc-
Whannel.
A fairly typical mixture of paintings
good, interesting, indifferent and splendid.
It will be noticed that there are several
pictures that have been donated by per-
sons other than Hinton. Throughout the
collection one comes across names of
different donors who followed Hinton’s
example. Goddard and McGregor are
names which continually crop up, and
there is even a hint of mystery in a cata-
logue entry describing one donor —
“Lady, anonymous.”
But, of course, the vast bulk of the
donations are Hinton’s. The Leist pic-
tures in the Women’s Club are remark-
ably good—much better than one could
have expected from his exhi-
bition a year or so ago. Erik Langker’s
oils, large, mature, bold, are stronger
than much of his recent work. And
there are some fine watercolors by
Ronald Steuart done in the days before
he discovered beetles, decayed stumps
and the lightless gloom of the surrealists.
The Macqueens in the Women’s Club
are as good an expression of coherence
within a rather restricted discipline of
composition as he has ever achieved. The
Wilsons are altogether different from
this artist’s “kitchen-stove” phase, and
Isabel McWhannel’s “Poplars” is a very
fine, subdued piece of work. The out-
standing painting is the Norman Lind-
say watercolor “Tryst”—peculiarly suit-
able for its setting. It shows a girl set-
ting off for a secret meeting, poised grace-
fully but escaping through a garden, and
within the technical beauty of the com-
position there is the capture of appre-
hension, purpose, flight, the whole
dramatised by a fragile light; emotion
and light caught in the same wash.
In the Lecture Hall there are a fine
large portrait in a gold frame called “Fine
Feathers” by E. Barnard Lintott, John
Rowell’s “Self Portrait”—one of his best
paintings—and “The Yellow Smock” by
Doris Zinkeisen (donor anonymous),
which has no place in the company of
“Grey Day, Coolah” by Lance Solomon.
Here it may be mentioned in passing
that Hinton’s prophecy concerning Solo-
mon’s work has been, in a measure, ful-
filled. There are some fine Solomons at
Armidale, but recently he has painted 1
oils with more weight and range.
At the far end of the hall, near the
piano, is an unusual Blamire Young—
“ The Explorers,” a large oil. There are
also Leists, a James Cook, a Lloyd Rees,
a fine Garrett Kingsley oil, “Rita” —the
Garrett Kingsleys at Armidale, particu- ;
larly “Rita” and “Eighteen,” in the
library, are superior to anything of his
lately exhibited in Sydney—a Napier
Waller, “Equestrienne,” a surprisingly
lively and graceful Hanke, together with
Hanke’s portrait of John Frith, a Rah
Fizelle, another Hanke, a solid, techni-
cally impressive but rather stodgy paint-
ing by Norman Carter, “Portrait of the
Artist’s Mother” by JBuckmaster, and an
Adrian Feint flowerpiece. Leist is seen
here again at his best in the portrait of
“Mrs. Huff Johnston,” a fine, serene
painting with dignity and precisely ob-
served detail —white dress, dark hair
parted in middle and charming hands.
Going back to the library again one
passes “Dora Creek” and another Hilder,
“Stableyard, Currency Lass Inn,” in the
corridor and—around the corner—“ The
Castellan” by E. J. Gregory, a vigorous
oil of a vigorous, bearded character
which was purchased in New Zealand in
1906-7. Near “Odysseus” is Tom
Roberts’s “Mosman’s Bay, 1894,” a blend
of styles, a kind of fusion of the early
Australian landscape painters and the
sunlight which came into Roberts’s later
paintings. Then there are “The White
Cloud” by Harold Herbert, which would
grace any collection; another Herbert,
“Still Waters” ; a minor Hilder; “The
Stone” by Percy Lindsay, a Lionel Lind-
say, a T. H. Young, a Collins, a Harry
J. Weston, “The Sobraon” by John Al-
cott, and some old Dutch houses by
G. V. F. Mann. The Percy Lindsay re-
calls his “Pymble,” one of the finest
specimens of his work, rich and lyrical,
which is also in the Armidale collection.
Inside the library there are Streetons
—’“Sydney Harbor from Sirius Cove,”
“The Old Inn, Richmond” and “Glou-
cester Buckets.” The first is gold land
and blue sea —not startling blue —with
faint smoke and perfect, light touches
of detail in the background. “The Old
Inn, Richmond” has, as Mr. Newling
has remarked, historical significance. It
is also interesting for the rich green
Streeton has exploited in the grass and
trees. “Gloucester Buckets” is a country
scene with attenuated figures and a red
buggy, reminiscent of Roberts’s paint-
ings, though on a smaller scale. And in
the figures, especially, curiously like —in
an ironical way—some of Russell Drys-
dale’s rabbit-trappers. But whereas
Streeton has given, as it were, a humor-
ous flick of the brush, Drysdale (who is
also represented at Armidale) has em-
barked on the business in dead serious-
ness, and left out the bush and the sun-
light.
There is also a magnificent Heysen,
“The Willow,” an oil, with the willow
leaning left and full of growth, light and
green. Something quite unlike his gum-
tree paintings, yet with the same majesty,
and with the breadth and original per-
ception of his Central Australian land-
scapes, it can be compared only with
Gruner’s “Pines,” Certainly it is im-
possible fully to appreciate Heysen’s
work without seeing this painting. In
the library, incidentally, there are several
of Nora Heysen’s pictures, of which the
best is “Eggs”—loving detail combined
with an earthly lyricism.
At the far end of the library—past the
art books, cases and cabinets donated
by Howard Hinton—is a rich, full Mar-
garet Coen watercolor, “Camellias and
Passion Fruit.” There are many other
Margaret Coens in the collection; the
best, probably, is a breaking-wave pic-
ture.
Among other excellent pictures are
Matson Nicholas’s “Petunias”; a “Break-
ing Wave” oil by W. Lister Lister; “Red
Apples,” a vivid, realistic and fresh oil by
Pap; a Fullwood “Sunset”; three
Mary Edwardses (of Fijian natives);
a Townshend watercolor and a Charles
Bryant. Also a Julius Olsen oil pre-
sented by J. R, McGregor and “Illustra-
tion,” a watercolor by Charles Conder,
presented by Julian Ashton.
“Tuning In,” by Lawson Balfour, is
specially mentioned by Hinton. There
are more Townshends, a Percy Spence
(1903), and “Chinaman’s Beach, Middle
Harbor,” by James R. Jackson, an oil
painted in 1909 ; then some Buckmasters,
an Eric Wilson, a Will Ashton, a Gwen
Ramsay. Other painters represented in-
clude J, W. Maund, John D. Moore,
Marjorie McChesney, Violet Mclnnes,
George Bell, Daryl Lindsay, Harold
Huntley, Howard Barron, Maud Sher- ,
wood, Francis McComas and Newton .
Hedstrom. In the library, too, is Frank ,
Medworth’s “Through the Figtrees”—not :
a great painting, but evidence of Hinton’s (
unerring ability to pick out the best an .
artist was capable of.
Following the corridor along one dis- ;
covers fresh riches. Blamire Youngs,
John Goodchild’s “The Diver,” Norman
Lindsay’s “Iris,” Hilders, Tulfords and
a Sturgess. And above the side stairs
Julian Ashton’s large oil “The Awaken-
ing.”
At this stage one must, as it were, pause
for breath. There is so much more to
be seen. Heysens, Lamberts, Longstaffs,
Bulletin sketches by Ted Scorfield
jostling with Gruners. At Armidale there
is, besides anything else, a fine collection
of black-and-white. In ’the ground-floor
corridors are—along a few yards—“ Sheep
Country” by Lance Solomon, “Resting”
by B. E. Minns (a team, a man, gum-
trees and golden light), “Evening” by
J. W. Tristram, “Parrot Seller, Costa
Rica” by Unk White, the drawing “De-
light” by Norman Lindsay, a flower-
piece by Matson'Nicholas, “Beach Girls”
by Norman Lindsay and—an example
of Hinton’s love of that type of Aus-
tralian art which can be labelled “minor”
yet which is full of character —Douglas
Fry’s “Boundary Rider,” a beautiful piece
of casual strength in black-and-white, the
boundary-rider lighting a smoke and
astride a bony and philosophical grey
horse with a fly-veil.
Further along the ground-floor corri-
dor are “The Yellow Gloves” by Esther
Patterson, a large oil with a rounded
sophistication, “The Wave” by Margaret
Coen, animal pictures by Stainforth,
“The Still Pool” by Ronald Steuart,
some fine Garlicks, a dark, anonymous
Dutch original, “Head of a Man,” more
Margaret Coens, “Sancho Panza” by
Sir John Gilbert, R.A. (1855), a Roland
Wakelin, “Cliffs at Curl Curl” by Mar-
garet Coen, a John Eldershaw, a kind
of blue symphony of the Thames by H.
K, Rooke, “Gold and Silver,” a very fine
Arnold Shore flowerpiece, two seapieces
by Sidney Cocks and “Winter’s After-
noon” by Gruner.
In a science laboratory one discovers
Percy Lindsay’s splendid “Pymble” and
the original of a Bulletin cartoon,
“Malta, the Invincible Island” by Norman
Lindsay, and a delightful, small “Rest-
ing Kangaroo” by Harry Garlick. In a
lecture-room there are Richard Ashton’s
“Beating to Windward” —a fine, spirited
painting of a yacht, with blue swirling
water, flying foam and drama; a sea
battle by W. Wyllie (1905), and “Beach
Idyll,” an indifferent Gruner. In the
Principal’s room there are a Robert
Johnson, a James Jackson, a fine Neo-
grady and an equally fine Szaba, “On
Exmoor” by H. S. Power, “The Road to
Bamarang”—watercolor—by W. Lister
Lister and Hans Heysen’s magnificent
“Murray River Cliffs.”
To sum up on this gigantic collection
is to sum up on a century of Australian
art. Hinton was not able, of course, to
acquire all the greatest masterpieces of
Australian painting—“ Fire’s On,” for ex-
ample—and his Armidale collection
would be all the richer if the pictures
he donated to the N.S.W, Gallery were
added to it. But the widest representation
of the work of Streeton, Gruner, Norman
Lindsay, Heysen and Hilder is in the
College collection; and there is sufficient
of the work of John Eldershaw,' Lance
Solomon and Margaret Coen to indicate
their importance among the inheritors of
the Australian tradition.
Mr. Newling, who since his retirement
has been working on the Hinton records,
has included in his writing an anecdote
concerning Hinton which may be taken
as typical, and summing up his attitude
to the Armidale collection. The story
was told by Dr. Cardamatis, whose port-
rait by Veal (a rather Meldrumish paint-
ing) hangs in the College. The doctor
wished to buy a Norman Lindsay paint-
ing from Hinton:
Dr. C.: Look, H.H., I’ll give you fifty
pounds for it.
H.H.: No, thanks. I’m giving it to the
Armidale Teachers’ College.
Dr. C.: Listen, H.H., you don’t under-
stand. I want that picture. I’ll give you
any price you ask.
H.H. (courteously): Dr. Cardamatis, you
don’t understand. It’s going north and
money just doesn’t matter.
But Hinton did not set out merely to
buy “names.” He wished to make his
collection representative of the best Aus-
tralian painting by all schools from
Buvelot to the present day, and it is in
the work of minor artists and in the total
effect of the collection that the main
interest lies. Time and again one has the
impression that Hinton has picked every
work of importance by any artist, how-
ever obscure; and the collection as a
whole, selected by a man of English birth
and a broad and profound knowledge of
European art, demonstrates how magnifi-
cent an achievement is the total of Aus-
tralian painting. There arises, above all,
from this collection, the sense of assur-
ance ; of stability; of a cultural achieve-
ment on the major scale —rich, varied,
permanent.
That this achievement has been,
and is being, attacked, chiefly by
the ephemeral critics of daily newspapers,
is, of course, inevitable. But'so, too, is
the preservation of all that is worthwhile
in a country’s art inevitable. While the
attacks continued, Howard Hinton went
on quietly buying all Australian work of
the finest quality that met his eye; there-
by assuring immortality for it and for his
memory.
The Birthrate
The sharp drop in the Australian birth-
rate is not altogether a simple reversion
to the normal pre-war state of affairs.
The present housing position, the high
cost of living, high taxation, shortages
and a dozen other similar factors are all
nightmares to young married couples.
My brother, for instance, has been
married for four years. He’s a banjj
officer and must keep up an “appear-
ance” on £450 a year, and, with cloth-
ing at present prices, that is no small
problem. His wife does her best to
budget, but with so many shortages she
has to take things when she can get ’em,
regardless of cost. Since their marriage
they have lived in army barracks, in
hotels and boarding-houses, with rela-
tions, and are now sharing a house —three
rooms and use bathroom for £3 a week.
Another £1 goes in taxation.
They are no nearer to having a house
or flat of their own than when they were
first married. They set out with high
hopes for the future, but they’re begin-
ning to accept as normal the continual
struggle from week to week and a life
without the privacy and comfort of their
own home. In what position are they,
and thousands like them, to bring up
children?
The “Government” can do little to
make the world position more secure or
to alter the modern outlook and way of
life, but it could do much more than it
is doing about the housing shortage, and
it could reduce taxation. — Mac (N.S.W.).
Superannuated Air-Raid Shelter
My air-raid shelter is now a lumber-
room, In it I have found some Bul-
letins published when it was being dug.
Browsing over them I discovered that
they read like ancient history. The
articles, the cartoons, the calls to patriot-
ism, the warnings against treachery, the
chronicles of brave deeds had faded from
memory, like the blisters raised by the
labor of digging-in. I tried to recall the
emotions that moved me to ply the crow-
bar and spade, but found that they had
vanished like the fabric of a dream. Even
the names of the heroes who fought and
fell for me and mine were remembered
only with difficulty.
A solemn thought. Am I different from
other men or do we all let the dead past
bury its dead, being “grateful only for
what we expect to receive”? Perhaps my
air-raid shelter is like the public memory,
in which famous exploits are hidden
away with household junk, covered with
cobwebs, to leave space for the happen-
ings of today and the schemes for to-
morrow.— Mea Culpa (S.A.).
Root of the Matter
You can have the Moscow “News”
twice a week for 10s. a year. The differ-
ence between cost of production, plus
freight and postage, and cost to
the subscriber or mug is charged up to
the home-grown mugs, many of whom
were robbed in cold blood when the
rouble was devalued. — Doomben (Q.).
N.Z. used to get boots and shoes from
Australia. Australia seems to be “out”
as an exporter of footwear, as well as
coal; anyway in 1946 Canada sent
10,249 dozen pairs, valued at £NZ44,604.
In 1947 the figures jumped to 29,749 and
£NZ113,363. During the same two
years, however, N.Z. imported about
8,000,000 bushels of Australian wheat at
ss. 9d., a fraction of the world price, and
will take any amount more at the same
figure.— M. Ponds (Vic.).
Shortage of fencing-wire can be blamed
for deterioration on many Queensland
farms. Sagging, dilapidated state of the
fences has obliged many farmers to allow
weeds and lantana to grow fence-high.
The hedges of rubbish help the rotting
fence to keep stock back; to clean them
up would let the stock walk straight in
to the cultivated paddocks.— W. Court
(Q.).
One of the youngsters who went to
New York at the invitation of the
“Herald-Tribune,” and spoke in its
forum,” returned with the information
that “Australia is two years ahead of
America in educational standards.” A
new variant of an old vaunt, “New South
Wales has the finest system of education
in the world”—a system in which youth,
has been taught a smattering of nearly
everything, though, because the “Govern-
ment” runs lotteries, denied knowledge of
the ruinous folly and anti-social quality
of gamblin g. The returned traveller looks
a bright lad and no doubt believes every
word of h ’s sweeping and hastily-arrived-
at generalisation. But it was scarcely
w orth while going so far to learn so
little.— Di Empson (N.S.W.).
A notable illustration of “K.L.M.’s”
statement “Halfcastes have no record of
achievement in any part of the world”
c 3 /3 A4B) was provided by the Griquas,
houth African halfcastes of Hottentot-
blood. In 1857 a section of
this tribe under a leader named Adam
Kok was settled, by Governor Sir George
Gre V in a P art " of Ca P e c °l° n y since
known as Griqualand East. On the way
from their old .home in the Orange Free
State they showed both great powers of
endurance and ingenuity in getting their
ox-wagons through difficult mountain
country. Settled on good soil they failed
completely to live up to that promising
beginning. Most of their time was spent
in carousal, the wherewithal for which
they secured by piecemeal sale of their
land to Europeans. A clergyman who
devoted himself to them could not reform
them and before long they were a landless
proletariat.—D. A. (NS.W.).

This dynamically styled South

the progress attained in Australian
rolling stock design and construction.
It is capable of 70 miles per hour
with a load of 500 tons.
Progress through STEEL . . .
Steel is the train traveller’s best friend. With iron it has made possible the evol-
ution of rail transportation to its present state of service and reliability.
The puffing billy of the early 1880 s contrasts greatly with today’s air-conditioned inter-
state expresses hauled by such powerful streamlined locomotives as illustrated above.
Australian steel has made possible the transformation. It has been utilised in the building
of bigger and better locomotives and electric trains. It has gone into axles and wheels,
