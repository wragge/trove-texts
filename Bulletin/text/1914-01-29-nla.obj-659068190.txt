The Red Page
1913
The All-Australian Art Exhibition for
1918 brought together a representative col-
lection of Australian work, with, however,
few outstanding pictures. The show was|
on the whole, quite up to the standard of
that of the preceding year, but scarcely an
improvement upon it. As usual, the pub-
lishers’ selection committee set their stan-
dard much too low; and many of the pic-
tures hung were unworthy of a place on the
walls.
Nineteen canvases dealing poetically with
Nature were admitted. Among the old ex-
hibitors, Nathan F. Spielvogel’s little pic-
ture of Our Gum Trees was altogether too
slight in conception; E. J. Rupert Atkinson,
in his Wayside Poems, disappointed the ex-
pectations roused by his earlier work: he
still retained the faults of his youth, with-
out gaining the breadth of vision of
maturity; Frederick T, Macartney’s
Earthen Vessels were admirable and am-
bitious examples of still life, but the life
was a little too still; and Henry Lawson
but echoed his once brilliant self in his
patriotic picture, For Australia.
Among the many new exhibitors, promis-
ing student work was shown by Julian Mit-
chell, a Westralian exhibitor, in his large
canvas, By Suns and Stars. Similar pro-
mise was evident in the work of Enid Der-
ham (The Mountain Road), M. Sweeney
( Melbourne's Armageddon ), Elsie Cole, in
her charming Holiday Songs, and the
anonymous author of Unconditioned Songs.
A posthumous collection of James L.
Cuthbertson’s works, grouped under the
title of Barwon Ballads, recalled a crafts-
man technically skilled and finished, but
without much inspiration. Grant Hervey
showed a huge canvas, Australians Yet,
whose color-sqheme was primary and
glaringly post-impressionistic. The work of
George Handley Ivnibbs, our only Australian
Cubist, Voices of the North and Echoes of
Hellas, was too angular to be understood.
A happy inspiration of Fritz Hart’s gave
us his Appassionato, a thing of glowing
color and youthfully joyous rhythm. In
quite another line, the panel of humorous
drawings shown by C. J. Dennis, under the
title of Backblock Ballads, proved the most
popular exhibit in this section; and the
sheer humor of the work, rather crowded as
some of his compositions were, justified the
people’s choice. A futurist study of The
Bush, by Bernard O’Dowd, however, was the
finest thing in this section. It has been
rightly bought for the National Collection.
From The Bulletin studio, The Collected
Verses of Arthur H. Adams was privately
lent.
There were only four exhibitors of His-
torical Portraits, two Victorian policemen
painting reminiscences of their youth, Henry
Giles Turner showing a slight sketch of Our
Little Rebellion, and John Leonard Forde
depicting, in anecdotal fashion, The Story
of the Bar of Victoria. The judges rightly
made no award.
No award was likewise made in the
dramatic section. Mrs. Boult’s drawing of
Joan of Arc showed some skill, but was
done with too heavy a hand. Chris J.
Brennan and J. le Gay Brereton collabo-
rated in A Mask, but the work was not in-
tended to be judged as representative; and
Edward A. Vidler’s The Rose of Ravenna
was conventional and trite.
Three Political Portraits were submitted,
the only work of interest being Bernard
Ringrose Wise’s historical painting of The
Making of Australia -—a fine conception of a
conventional theme.
J*
As always there were many canvases
that aimed at telling a story. This year 30
of these fictional pictures were exhibited.
From the prolific studio of A. C. Rowland-
son, his pupils submitted a number of rather'
crude studies. However, the aim of these
artists is popularity rather than art. The
best of these works was Norman Lindsay’s
audacious nude, A Curate in Bohemia. R.
J. Cassidy, in his Chandler of Corralinga,
painted a faithful Australian background;
so, too, did E. F. Christie, in The Calling
Voice. A. G. Stephens supplied, in Bill’s
Idees, some rather mechanical humor.
Ambrose Pratt was represented by two
“slick” studies, The Golden Kangaroo and
Wolaroi’s Cup; and, as this artist was re-
presented in the descriptive section by a
crudely-painted picture of The Real South
Africa, a special prize for Bulk, or Prolific-
ness, was awarded to Pratt. Kate Helen
Weston did not come up to her last year’s
exhibit, her study of The Man Macdonald
lacking depth. A decorous portrait of John
Scarlett, Ganger, by Donald Maclean, bought
by the Y.M.C.A., disappointed the critics.
Some cleverly dull work was shown by
Alfred Buchanan in The Modern H6loise.
An African study by Mary Gaunt, cata-
logued as Every Man’s Desire; a South
American sketch by Dorothea Mackellar,
Outlaw’s Luck; and G. B. Lancaster’s too-
crowded Canadian canvas, The Law
Bringers, had not the appeal that belongs to
purely Australian work. These canvases
showed that our artists overseas are learn-
ing their trade, though the best Australian
work still remains with us. Some admir-
able illustrations for children and flappers
were shown by Lilian and Ethel Turner,
Mary Grant Bruce, Vera G. Dwyer and
Evelyn Goode. Mabel Sprent’s Love’s
Apprenticeship was a promising first at-
tempt, but that was all. The Outlaw, by
David Hennessey, which had gained a medal
m an overseas exhibition, proved to be a
poor rendering of a subject much better
treated by Rolf Boldrewood.
The red ticket of approval was early put
on five canvases. These were Lawson’s
Triangles of Life, in which this artist
merely echoed his greater self; Mrs. Das-
keins’s delightful and faithful still-life study
of A Desert Rose—a. minor triumph; D.
Egerton Jones’s naive portrait of Peter
Piper, wonderfully rich in color though
lacking in design; Eleanor Mordaunt’s
realistic painting of Lu of the Ranges, the
bush background of which was brilliantly
Brangwynesque; and Dowell O’Reilly’s
masterpiece of imagination, Tears and
Triumph. This work was the finest in the
whole exhibition; and if the author only
lives long enough he will become an Old
Master.
In the landscape gallery, Ab originalities,
by Charles H. Bertie, was a fine subject
brutally mangled; and of the nine exhibits
the best and the second-best were respec-
tively C. E. W. Bean’s stirring seascape,
Flagships Three, and J. H. P. Murray’s big
canvas of Papua.
No award was made in the Sociological
section, the only work of merit being Jessie
Ackermann’s rather dull study of Australia
from a Woman’s Point of View.
_ The special prize awarded for Humor was
divided between C. J. Dennis’s Baclcblock
Ballads and A Curate in Bohemia, by Nor-
man Lindsay. James Edmond’s A Journal-
ist and Two Bears, being from The
Bulletin studio, had not been entered for
competition.
In the special section devoted to Art,
there was only one exhibitor, but the merits
of Will Dyson’s Cartoons made the absence
of other exhibitors unnoticeable.
An innovation, much appreciated by the
public, was the hanging, in a separate gal-
lery, of those works whose badness almost
amounted to genius. These included
Stumpy, a Cattle Dog, by “Typhena” ; Aus-
tralian Idylls, by E. A. Plenty; Australian
Poems, by H.R.H.; Things Coming to Pass,
by Robt. Crossley; The King’s Folly and the
Queen’s Revenge, by Viva Vox; Wyaparo
(wisely unsigned); Gwen, by Leslie Alfred
Redgrave; Souls in Pawn, by Lindsay Rus-
sell ; Sands o’ the Desert, by Harlingham
Quinn ; and The Eldest Son of Q. Elisabeth,
by Isabella S. Nicholls.
The National Gallery purchased the fol-
lowing pictures:—
Tears and Triumph, by Dowell O’Reilly.
The Bush, by Bernard O’Dowd.
Flagships Three, by C. E. W. Bean.
Condor
Charles Conder is the first of the Aus-
tralian artists who are making, or who have
made, their reputations in London to be
granted the distinction of a biography. The
reason, of course, is that Charles Conder is
dead. But few modern artists have received
so graceful an accolade as Frank Gibson’s
Charles Conder, His Life and Work—a.
sumntuous volume with 120 reproductions in
color and line, published by John Lane.
Before his death, four years ago, Conder
had been acknowledged, chiefly in the coterie
of art critics, artists and collectors that
centres in Chelsea, as a master —another
Beardsley, or, maybe, another Whistler. Yet
his art is singularly his own; he occupied
a lonely place in painting, and on his death
he left no school. “He was not even a
great draughtsman, but he was an artist
possessed of vast and astonishing powers of
invention, and a brilliant colorist. He
showed his genius in the decorative panels
he _ designed... .These were achievements
which would have gained him in other ages
constant employment in adorning public
buildings and palaces. His fan designs, too,
a i>- among the loveliest ever made in Europe.
Indeed, as a decorative artist and painter-
poet who created and lived in a fairyland
of his own, Conder certainly deserves some
record.”
Conder was born in London in 1868.
When 17 he was sent to Sydney, where he
jdined the N.S.W. Lands Department as a
trigonometrical surveyor. But in 1886 he
left the survey party for Sydney, where he
got a job on The Illustrated Sydney
News, doing there small landscape drawings
for a salary that never exceeded £2 a week.
Here, however, he met Fullwood, Mahoney
and Minns, and sketched much with them
at Richmond. In 1888 ke tried Melbourne,
where he met Streeton and Tom Roberts,
and with the former he conducted painting
classes. He exhibited a number of studies
at “The 9x5 Impression Exhibition” in
1889, when Impressionism received its usual
hostile nress criticism. In his work at this
period Streeton’s technical influence is very
evident. The N.S.W. Gallery bought one of
his oils. He left for London in 1890. These
five years in Australia founded Conder’s
style, and their influence is not belittled by
his biographer.
In Paris, Conder rather desultorily studied
at Julien’s ; and there, a poor draughtsman,
he remained obscure. Streeton still influ-
enced him, but gradually he felt drawn to
modem French; artists.' "it was perhaps M.
Anquetin who had the strongest innueuce
over Conder of any contemporary artist, and
it was an influence which lasted all through
his life; he may have got a little from
Daumier,., .but it was the latter who
taught Conder a robuster view of life.”
In 1892 Conder and William Rothenstein
held a joint exhibition iu Paris, where the
delicacy, finessse and originality of Conder’s
work greatly impressed the critics; and
the following year he was elected an Asso-
ciate Member of the Societe Nationale des
Beaux Arts. In 1894 he exhibited in
London, whither he had returned to live,
“L’Oiseau Blue,” which now hangs in the
Melbourne Gallery.
But it is for his fans that Conder will be
remembered. He began to design fans in
1893; and it was with a series of fans that
he held his first exhibition in London in
1899. He died in 1909.
When Conder painted a portrait he con-
sidered chiefly the decorative qualities of his
sitter, paying little attention to the likeness
or to the draughtsmanship. “He often
showed a curious inability to draw a face.”
So, too, when he sketched from nature, his
landscapes were poems in colors founded on
some slight hint given to him from the sub-
ject. “In his drawings on silk, and in his
numerous designs for fans, the fluid medium
of the wash and the finely ribbed surface of
the silk suited his dreamy art perfectly.”
Conder was, of course, largelv indebted to
Chinese and Japanese art. But it is Cnn-
der’s color that is almost the whole of Con-
der’s art- The rest is Conder’s poetic imagi-
nation and infinite fertility of design.
In accordance with his temperament, Con-
der had no particular method of working.
He could paint under any conditions. He
seldom drew from life, but almost entirely
from memory. “In his Australian days he
painted large landscapes on the spot, but
not quite literally, and they were generally
finished Indoors.” He did not paint from
the model, though he casually made sketches
of his friends, and found a use for them
afterwards. “Those tiny scenes in the medal-
lions of his fans, where a whole world is
expressed more completely than in many a
large, canvas, were painted entirely from his
imagination. Although he had the mien of
a dreamer, his observation was very acute.
His brain seemed to retain for future use
whatever he chose to select.” Often he
painted at night by artificial light. He had
no method or scheme when he was painting
a picture, nor did he ever make studies for
it. And— he was a very good business man.
“It has been said that his art owed
nothing to his Australian experiences, but
this is surely not so. for the five years he
spent in that country, from his 17th to his
21st year, is a very impressionable period in
- 1 young man’s lifetime, and it is certain
that it influenced Conder’s coloring. In
Melbourne and Sydney he was already much
remarked amongst his fellow artists as a
rare and original colorist. In was in his
Australian days, too, that he first got what
was a favorite motive, which he liked to
paint all his life —roses and fruit-trees in
full bloom.”

Maurice Baring writes his Lost ■ Diaries
(Duckworth, per Dymock’s Library) very
pleasantly. He gives extracts from the
diaries of people like George Washington,
Marcus Aurelius, Sherlock Holmes,
(Edipus Rex, William the Conqueror,
Mark Antony, the Man in the Iron
Mask and Hamlet. It is delightful to
find, for instance, that Tiberius notes: “It
is a comfort to think that, although I may
not go down to posterity as a great mili-
tary genius like Julius Caesar, I shall at
least leave a blameless name, as far as my
domestic life is concerned, and an untarn-
ished reputation for benevolence, kindness
and unswerving devotion to duty. Without
being conceited, I think that some of my
verse will live.” Baring has the delightful
inconsequence of the writers of diaries.
Thus, (Edipus Rex idly mentions: “In the
afternoon went to the theatre. Saw the
tragedy of Adam and Eve, an historical
drama, translated from the Hebrew. Very
long. The part of the Archangel, danced
by Thepsis, was very bad, and the man who
danced Eve was too old; but the snake was
good. Scenery fine, especially the tree
(which had real leaves).” The mystery of
the Man in the Iron Mask is explained from
his diary. He had simply got the tired feel-
ing. He was tired of 26 things, among
which was “having to look as if I thought
the King an amusing conversationalist,”
and of having to change his clothes three
times a day. Consequently he asked the
King for a nice, comfortable prison, but
was continually having to change his lodg-
ings because he could not get a prison to
himself. Two of the best diaries are those
of a modern school-boy and of an English
governess who lived through the French
Revolution in Paris without ever having any
suspicion that there was anything peculiar
happening, It is quite agreeable fooling.
How to Write the Box-Office Hay
George M. Colian, a New York manager,
reveals the secrets of the box-office in NpV.
McClures. You know there are such things
as reflex actions? If you hit the kneecap
at precisely the right spot, the foot gives a
jerk. Well, if you hit the audience at pre-
cisely the right spot, the audience will give
a jerk. Automatically, you understand.
What you are aiming at is not the audi-
ence’s knee, nor even its brain: you merely
hit it in its spinal cord. That’s where audi-
ences think. Or, rather, that’s where audi-
ences keep their emotions. And there are
three kinds of hits that will produce three
kinds of reflex actions. These are known as
Tears, Laughs and Thrills.
“If we are normal, we all cry at the same
things, laugh at the same things, and are
thrilled by the same things.... The play-
wright knows exactly what they are. He
has not invented them; he has inherited
them. His predecessors used them over and
over again ; his successors will use them to
the end of time. In his own language he
calls them his ‘bag of tricks,’ or, sometimes,
more dignifiedly, his ‘tools of emotion.’ If
produced at the right moment and with
sufficient skill, they never fail to strike the
audience in the midriff. They Comprise
the complete science of the ‘lump in the
throat.’ They may be regarded as the
germs or bacilli of emotions. He can inocu-
late audiences with them, and get just as
definite results as do the scientists when
they inoculate their guinea-pigs with the
microbes of disease. And he does so just as
deliberately.”
Cohan mentions 30 motives that act upon
the tear-ducts, beginning, obviously, with “A
child in a nightie saying his 'Now I lay me,’
and concluding the prayer with, ‘And, please,
dear Dod, send my pana back to me,’ substi-
tuting ‘mamma’ for ‘papa’ in a play of the
problem species.” The child-motive appears in
many of the other tearful scenes. Among
the “atmosphere” scenes are: Someone, or
some couple, seated before a fire while a
girl off-stage softly plays the piano (“Mile-
stones”) ; someone playing the organ; church
chimes on Christmas Eve; any love scene
played in the moonlight; the whistle of a
train in the distance; the faithful old ser-
vant ; “Home, Sweet Home”; “What are
they doing at home now?”; “I’ll be waiting
for you when you return.”
Things that rouse the loud laugh com-
prise: intoxication, the sight of a man laden
with many large bundles, anyone stumbling, a
swear-word, a pair of lovers interrupted in
their kiss, a bashful man who edges away
from a woman as she edees nearer, and the
innumerable cases of “stoush,” especially
when the blow is giyen by mistake.
The thrill consists of: the production of
a revolver, whether it is subsequently used
or not: darkening the stage; lightning and
thunder; a shadow thrown against the wall
by a character carrying a lantern or a can-
dle ; smashing furniture or breaking glass;
a woman’s shriek ; a locked door; a loudly
ticking clock* etc.
It is strange that such experienced
manager as Cohan omits the finest thrill of
them all : “The man who lays his hand upon
a woman except in the way of kindness —”
In a suffragette nlav, of course, the formula
would run : “The woman who lays her hand
upon a Cabinet Minister except in the way
of kindness —”

The Rymbel competition, in which a
guinea is offered for the best rymbel sub-
mitted, closes on the last day of this month.
Entries for the sonnet on our January must
be in by February 4. As there seems to
have been some confusion in the minds of
competitors last month, in future the 4th
of the following month will be the date of the
closing of the monthly sonnet competitions.
The Round Table, the excellent ouar-
terly review of Empire politics (2s. 6d.) for
December, contains valuable articles upon
the Irish Question, “Islam and the Empire,”
and “Canada and Anglo-American Rela-
tions.” Special Australian and M.L. corres-
pondence forms a regular department in a
magazine invaluable for its historical sur-
veys of Imperial questions.
Those who delight in parody can get it in
A Century of Parody and Imitation, edited
by Walter Jerrold and R. M. Leonard (Ox-
ford University Press, Is. 6d.), and in The
Moxford Booh of English Verse ,- by A.
Stodart-Walker (Nash, 4s. Cd.). The former
contains the classical examples of parody:
the latter, much more amusing, is the work
of a modern —a clever narody on The
Oxford Book of Verse. Incidentally, Gordon
appears as the author of “The Sick Stock
Broker.”

big-game cartridges, either smoke-
less or black powder, can always
be relied on to be sure fire, accur-
ate and to have the proper speed
and penetration. You can help

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

The following interesting letter is written
Clements Tonic.
“To CLEMENTS TONIC, LTD.
“From May to the end of October, 1912,1 suffered
agonies with acute MUSCULAR RHEUMATISM.
My ankles, knees and shoulder joints became
swollen and painful, and the excruciating pains in
my back were almost unbearable. I was in a
helpless condition, could scarcely stand; to make
matters worse, I completely lost my appetite, and to sleep at night was out of the
question.
“I had the best medical advice and medicines. Turkish and hot salt-water
baths out of number, also was massaged three times a week, but all to no purpose.
“I began to despair of ever being well again, and, as a last resource, concluded
to try CLEMENTS TONIC, I had read so much of it.
“I did so, and I FELT A WONDERFUL IMPROVEMENT. By the time
I had finished my second large bottle the swelling of the joints and pains in the
back left me, my appetite had returned, and I slept well. When I was on my
fourth bottle I felt as vigorous and strong as I ever did in my life.
“I can now go about and enjoy myself with renewed energy, that makes life
worth living. I have only Clements Tonic to thank for coming to my timely
assistance, when all other remedies failed to restore me to perfect health.

I Can Introduce
You to Hundreds
of Sufferers that
I Have Cured of
VARICOSE
VEINS!
MR. G. VECSEY.
IF YOU suffer from Varicose Veins qr Ulcers, or both, I believe that 1
can completely cure you. I have treated hundreds of terrible cases
with the utmost success, and I know that but very few cases are really
incurable. Very few doctors tell you they can cure this trouble. They
prefer to ignore it. Doctors could not cure me. I cured myself. I then
cured my friends, and then made hundreds of new friends by curing people
who had suffered in some cases for a quarter of a century. Hence I believe
1 can cure you. It will pay you well to fully investigate my method.
My treatment is applied at your own home, does not require you to lay up, and is painless and
harmless. The worst cases: usually respond inside the first few weeks, and old, stubborn cases are
perfectly cured under a suitable course of treatment. Give me full details of your case. If I can
cure you I will say so, and send you a guarantee. If I cannot, I will at once advise you. You run
no risk. You can lose nothing if I should fail; but I have built up a large business —not on fail-
ures, but on successes, in cases formally given up as hopeless. LET ME SEND YOU SCORES OF
GRATEFUL TESTIMONIALS. WE GET DOZENS OF LETTERS LIKE THE FOLLOWING:—
Wimmera St., Stawell, Vic., Slay 5, 1913.
Manager Yecsey Varix-arnim,
Hear Sirs, —Am sorry I have not been more punctual in my correspondence,
but Ido not need any more treatment. The ulcers are entirely healed, and the
veins are now normal, and totally free from aches or pain, and I can get about
again, for which I am very happy. 1 have told numbers of people of your
splendid treatment, and it certainly justifies the claims you make for it).
When I began your treatment I was dreadfully crippled, and almost wholly
incapacitated, and I shall never fail to recommend the Vecsey Method whenever
I get an opportunity.—Yours gratefully, James Williams.

SMOKING!
MOST MEN would cure themselves of the
Tobacco habit if they knew they could
do so easily and without discomfort.
It takes but ten minutes for tobacco to
change the beats of the heart. To keep it up

Collapse, Tobacco Cancer, and Stomach,
Liver or Kidney Disease.
TOBACCO SPECIFIC is a harmless, vege-
table remedy that will make the user of
tobacco in anv form absolutely abandon the
habit for good.” It not only destroys the crav-
ing the desire, the appetite for tobacco, but
restores to health the entire nervous system,
and aids nature in entirely eliminating from
the system the Nicotine Poison.

Sir John Fuller (who is still Governor of Victoria
on full pay, though he will not return to Australia)
writes Councillor Ilennessy, President of the Overseas
Club, thus: —“The growth of the club, its increas-
ing members, and the genuine recognition of its
imperial mission, were amongst the many proofs
which from day to day it was my delight to witness
of the spirit of abiding loyalty and deep devotion
which inspires the whole Australian race. There may
be some who think, to -use a sporting phrase, that
the Australian is apt to place Australia first, and
the rest of the Empire nowhere. . . .Apart from, and
largely consequent upon, a legitimate appreciation
of their own high destinies, there lies in their hearts
the imperial spirit as deep-seated as in any other
portion of the Empire.”
That which inshpires the whole Australian —

Raisli —Race ! —the whole Australian race —
(Ezchuse me layin’ on the burrer thick)
I’m quite (hie) shure Orshtralia’s not firsht

The deep devqshun (an’ that blessed rot)

Grey Thrush.
With saddened heart and listless feet
I sought the bush, to breathe the calm
Whose silence brings a solace sweet,
Whose every growth exhales a balm;
On banks where rare epacrids blush
I sheltered near a white-limbed tree,
And there a grey Australian thrush
Sang liquid melodies to me.
His rich, full-throated music broke
The somnolence of copse and dune,
And chirps, and drowsy echoes, woke
To harmonies about his tune,
In which this gallant chose to sing,
With chords dispelling dingy care,
That joy was yet a living thing—
Like rays through darkness, everywhere
No time for carking care had he,
This happy spirit of the glade;
He sang the joys of being free,
The golden hours of sun and shade;
His life was no debateful thing—
Not any problem vexed his soul—
Pure ignorance of cares, that bring
To men the bonds of tax and toll.
Pure ignorance of scheme and plan,
Of right and wrong, or any sin—
The yokes that make a slave of man ;
The world was his to revel in.
And so he sang, this blithesome heart,
Full-throated numbers, which he drew
From stores of his instinctive art,
As down the winding brakes he flew.
Good. comfort, friend, and solace sweet- —-
This was the boon your song-craft gave,
Making the mellowed hour comnlete
With airier thought and kinship brave;
Dark melancholy’s antidote
Is he. this tuneful champion bold;
The srev Australian thrush, whose note
Falls like a drop of liquid gold.

My Lady’s Tears.
As we went down the Summer way
The hedge-row vines came trailing after.
With bird and bloom tbe paths were gay,
And all the woi-ld was filled with laughter.
She.made a song she bade me sing;
And ail amid the rainbow weather,
As .Toy went by on happy wing,
Our Fancy plucked a shining feather.
Her soft brown eyes looked into mine,
Her fingers with my heart were playing,
The yellow sundrops fair and fine
The dappled ground with light were spray-
ing.
Our life was all so close and sweet.
Bright Hopes, in troops, came pattering
after
With small bell sandals on their feet
That jangled to my lady’s laughter.
To-day the sloping sunlight fell
Athwart a bleak world faintly crying,
We heard the chill airs passing tell
How faded Summer lay a-dying.
We had no song to make or sing.
For it was sad and silent weather,
And Joy upon a moulting wing
Dropped at our feet a broken feather.
The sobbing Autumn held mv sleeve,
Her silver light about us shaking,
As one who lingers loth to leave
The place of some dead merry-making.
And still around our straying feet
Clear love a tender watch was keeping,
Because my lady was so sweet
When both her eyes and heart were weep-
ing.
Behind us, silently and slow,
Tall, white-winged Hopes came gliding
after
To wipe my lady’s tears and sow
The happy seeds of quiet Laughter.

The Large Face Gear
on Le Blond Single Pulley Drive Millers
Makes Bigger Cuts Possible.
m
V . :
The face gear is the
largest used on any
All-Geared Miller
built.
This means smoother
cutter rotation and
longer life to the cut-
ter.
The face gear is as
large as the largest
cutter the machine
will swing. This means
full power delivered
to the cutter, regard-
less of its diameter.
And the operator does
not step out of a two-
foot circle to secure
full mechanical con-
trol ; no other Miller
has this feature.
The Le Blond Milling
Machine will produce
accurately milled sur-
faces more rapidly
than any other Miller,
because the Operator
has full control of the
machine without leav-
ing his position, and they are sufficiently rigid to stand up under the heaviest cuts.
He can secure the full-speed range, any feed variation, engage ,or reverse any feed,
and use the quick return to table without moving out of a two-foot circle.
AND HE KNOWS THAT:—
The large Face Gear,
The Hardened Steel Spindle Bearing,
The Nickel Steel Driving Gears,
The Rigid Box Knee Construction,
The Powerful Feed Drive, and
The Grouped Control,
Enable him to produce a better day’s work, and THAT’S HOW YOU WIN.

the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “ copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-

PARTIALLY-PAID IMMIGRATION
AND WHOLLY-PAID IMPORTA-
TION.
Sign£ of a falling-off in the supply of able-
bodied . white immigrants are calculated to
make good Australians bury themselves in
deep thought with a tombstone on top. This
country wants a much greater furnishment
of sturdy inhabitants —the plain, hard-
working variety. Unfortunately we are
farther away from the places which have
these people to spare than any of the other
countries that want them, and the journey
is more costly than that to Canada or the
United States,'and the British inhabitant
of the plain, hard-working variety is so
flagrantly hard up that he finds it very
difficult to get here without assistance. Also,
as time goes on, his difficulty grows no less.
Food prices in England have been rising
faster than wages, and the savings out of
which the occasional Bull pays his fare to
this Land of Promise are probably even a
little scarcer than they used to be. And the
immigration business has been sadly muddled
at this end. The people who first enthused
about it were largely Tories, and mostly
Foreign-traders. They wanted to import
people abundantly and to import cheap-labor
goods freely. Then the imported people were
to work so nearly for nothing that they
would be able to compete with the makers
of the cheapest imported goods, and a
beautiful cheap era was to set in. Now
the. Labor party looks coldly on the impor-
tation of people, which is the thing we
need, and doesn’t look half so coldly on the
importation of cheap-labor goods, which is
the thing we don’t need. So neither party
has given the much-needed immigrant a fair
show. The immigration policy ought to be
put on a strongly Protectionist, and Demo-
cratic basis. In other words, it ought to
have a fresh start.
It costs a lot of money to import skilled
workers on a large scale in order that they
may make on the spot practically all the
goods we require, but it costs a lot more to
leave then! out and import the goods. As a
rule, we only pay part of the cost of bring-
ing in, say, a skilled tailor from England—
a person who, judging from our vast pur-
chases of foreign clothes, seems to be really
required. We pay the whole passage of an
imported slop suit and pay for the suit as
well. The tailor probably brings a little
money with him. The suit doesn’t. The
man starts to repay the money spent on
him by becoming and remaining a taxpayer,
and by rearing a family of taxpayers; the
imported pants don’t refund a copper of
their passage money, nor do they rear a
family of pants to succeed them. If £2O be
sent away to bring a skilled artisan to
Australia, and he can make goods worth
say, even £3OO per annum, he prevent 3!,
every year, the outflow of many times the
small price he cost, while the importation
of goods goes on for ever and leads to noth-
ing except new foreign loans. And this is
taking no account of the fact that even an
imported tailor may carry a gun to some
purpose when Australia calls, while an
imported coat and vest never will. No doubt
some imported people are badly selected and
prove a poor bargain, but the same thing is
true of some imported goods. This country
lias by ill-luck helped thieves and bush-
rangers to reinforce its population, but a
certain dredge which the Geelong Harbor
Board once tried to import was quite as
rotten as any bushranger and quite as dis-
honest as any thief. And some of the drink
we have imported and paid for lias been
worse than any of the drunkards we im-
ported and. partly paid for.
One stereotyped plea of a certain class of
Laborite is that assisted immigration is a
Tory device for the reduction of wages.
And so it is. when worked in conjunction
with Freetrade or Low Tariffism, though
why it should be conjoined to these iniqui-
ties no one knows. Another familiar Labor
plea is that The Time is Not Yet Ripe. It
seems strange that Labor should borrow
that tired old Conservative shibboleth, but
it does. The time for the importation of
men, it is said, will really arrive when all
the men already here are fully employed.
A more reasonable view would be that the
time for tljfe importation of goods will arrive
when all the goods that can be made here are
being made here. Of course there will
always be an occasional unemployed, or at
least he will always exist until the human
race is greatly improved—the drunk, the
loafer, or the cantankerous person whose
fellow-workers demand that he shall be
ejected in the interests of peace. But apart
from these it should be possible to find
employment for everybody so long as the
country is so thinly peopled that it can grow
its own food supply. And when something
goes.wrong the first idea should be to reduce
the influx, not of the worker who may re-
quire to have part of his passage paid, but
of the bales of goods which require all their
passage money paid and which come here
on a wholly pauper basis. There may be
reason in taking certain precautions when
Six Hatters arrive, to pay taxes, and help
defend the country, and assume their fair
share of the public debt, and provide cus-
tomers for the Australian producer. But
when 600,000 hats arrive, without a redeem-
ing feature about them in a national and
patriotic sense, it is a much more serious
business.
The curse of Australia is the Gracing
after what is supposed to be Cheap Labor,
and after Cheap-Labor goods. The importa-
tion of manufactured goods depends on
cheapness. It is purely a matter of com-
petition. If this country imports the
artisan —sufficient of him to supply the
community’s wants—then he must be paid
at Australian rates and be the equal of the
man who is already here. If it imports
most of the goods without the artisan, then
it doesn’t require to be officially aware what
the man behind them is paid. It knows
that in many cases he is paid very little,
and that that is the reason why his products
get here, but it needn’t profess to hear any-
thing about this. It can always look the
other way. There is a small, fairly-well-
paid industrial aristocracy here, and its
wants are largely supplied, under the system
of lavish imports, by a very ill-paid gang of
serfs somewhere else. It is the case of the
Louisiana or Arkansas planter and his
nigger in the days before the war, except
that the nigger is not actually on the
premises. It is the case of Rome or Athens
or Carthage and its slave, only our slave —-
the English sweater’s slave who is sub-let
to us —is out of sight. And the system has
exactly the same dangers. The cheap drudge
of Rome or the cheap Sambo of Carolina
didn’t fight for his country because, though
he was in it, he wasn’t of it. He worked
for it, but there his interest ended. Under
the system of low tariff and huge imports
and discouraged immigration a very large
section of our Sambo is even less likely to
fight for us than was the Carolina nigger,
for he has never so much as seen us.
* * * *
No doubt the policy of importing goods
instead of the makers of goods has its tem-
porary advantages. In the matter of
organising labor a great deal of trouble is
saved by not having much labor to organise.
The worry of being our brother’s keeper is
avoided by letting someone else keep
the brother. It requires no small political
ability to find out how to pay the producing
community a white man’s wage for a fair
day’s work, and it simplifies matters very
much to let somebody at the other end of
the world pay a large percentage of our
producers a dog’s wage, and to be thinking
of something else when we learn that he is
doing it. And while the low-tariff Laborite
shirks his problem the, Tory importer makes
big profits, and so two people are gratified.
Their tacit alliance is a curious example,
like the league of the bookmaker and the
parson. _ It pays the employer—who is all
Australia —for a while to have a cheap
Sambo working for him—that is to say, it
pays until the bottom falls out, and no
longer. This country is accumulating three
separate troubles through encouraging
wholly-paid imports rather than partially-
paid immigrants. In the first place, it is
accumulating debts instead of men, for
hardly a week passes in which it doesn’t
float another foreign loan with which to
meet the bill for the imported cheap-labor
goods. Secondly, it is leaving itself
desperately short of fighting men and of
taxpayers, for the lOU neither carries a
gun nor contributes to the revenue, and the
same may be said of the low-wage Bull
toiler whose products William McMillan
and his Tory kind drag into this country to
their own great- profit. Lastly, our whole
industrial system, with, its trades unions, its
high wages, its short -hours, its arbitration
courts and the rest, is being built on a
shoddy basis. More of the wages are paid
out of foreign loans than is the case in any
other country. And there is no other coun-
try which imports so much in proportion to
its population, and which consequently
denends so much for its prosperity on the
fact that, somewhere or another, it has a
cheap Sambo working for it. There will
be a lamentable readjustment of affairs
and an awful mass of arrears to make good
when, through financial panic or war. or
both, we lose both our loan and our Sambo.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Epitaph of Daniel O’Connor.
Exit Dan. He was aged about 70 when
he passed out, but most people thought he
was 100, for the older generation felt it
impossible to imagine' any period in Sydney
when Daniel O’Connor was not. It is hard
to say which was his most striking char-
acteristic in his prosperous days. His
sloppy and tremendous eloquence; his bell-
topper that looked as if it had been oiled,
so refulgent was it; his frock coat; his
cataract of white whiskers; his blarney; his
readiness to promise anything to anybody;
his knowledge of the “Frinch” language—
the language in which he addressed a dazed
and flabbergasted Sara Bernhardt ; his vast
mass of learned misinformation, all these
belonged to Dan and to no one else. He
abased himself politely at the shrine of
Woman. He was a poet in soul, of the
humbler Martin Tupper school, only his
verse didn’t scan too well. Being a poet
in soul, circumstances naturally made him a
butcher, and then a politician and a Post-
master-General. Also, being a poet (in soul,
not in print) and a politician and a Post-
master-General, the big fortune he made out
of meat swiftly took to itself wings and fled,
so that he died in great poverty in a public
institution. He didn’t waste his pile in hos-
pitality, but in the struggle to profitably
extract sunbeams out of cucumbers and
such-like enterprises. He took too much
of his innate romance into his busi-
ness affairs, and that ruined him. Also
it helped to ruin other people, but
Dan was hardly responsible: for that.
He was what the bogs and his ances-
tors had made him. A certain Sydney
theatre, which led a tempestuous existence
in its early, partially-built days, and brought
the ground landlord, the building syndicate,
the mortgagees and the lawyers to such
confusion that no one really knew for a time
who owned the unfinished ruin, absorbed
some of his money. Also he : held up the
traffic one day while pointing'out the ruin
as a splendid investment to ap elderly lady
with some small savings, and delivering to
her an impassioned address on the English,
French, Greek, Italian, Spanish, Scandin-
avian end German drama. When he had
finished the traffic was tied in a knot, and
policemen were shouting and blowing their
whistles at Daniel, and the dazed lady had
decided to put her little hoard into the spec.
She lost it, but she said afterwards that
Daniel’s sermon on the drama was pretty
fair value. A misfortune of the deceased in
his public life was that no one took him
seriously. He had some political capacity,
but it was obscured by his whirling meta-
phors, his adjectives, his affability, his volu-
minousness and his whiskers. Yet he wasn’t
a bad P.M.G., as State P.M.G.’s went in the
days when the Post Office billet represented
the tail end of the Ministry. Dan was one
of those men who look very big when sitting
down and not very big when standing up.
unlike the late W. H. Traill, who
an ordinary man when sitting down iand a
dangerous enemy when he arose. In his
latter days the late lamented weht to America
to publish the story of his life, but the San
Francisco earthquake swallowed the inaccu-
rate manuscript, likewise the author’s clothes
and his wonderful bell topper. After that
he lectured without much success. His
romantic instincts led to his name being
mixed up in the cablegrams*with the adven-
tures of a foreign countess, who fell among
thieves, or publishers or something, but the
poetry that Daniel wrote to her (if any)
was never given to the pubßc, Towards the
end, when the tall hat tarnished
and the wonderful frock-coat was green,
certain friends were willing to come to the
ancient gentleman’s assistance, but the
ancient, being more than. - ever a gushing
child of Nature, required so much assistance
to keen him afloat that he finally drifted to
a public institution, where he was pomilar
to the last. He was orobably. the first Papal
knight to die in that pla£e-„ His departure
left a void in Kent, Clarence and York
streets and Wynyard-squara which he used
to perambulate greatlv and Thoughtfully dur-
ing the last months of his life. Summed up,

Boots and Choose.
“0.K.” writes :
As an unbiassed outsider, much concerned about
the comfort of my poor feet, I have been reading
the boot and shoe trade evidence elicited by the
Inter-State Commission. Manufacturers come along
and contradict one another, more or less, as to the
amount of increased Protection needed by the local
industry. Retailers contradict one another concern-
ing the comparative profits on Australian and im-
ported boots. Manufacturers being also retailers, as
a rule, speak either from a factory or a shop point
of view, according to which wav the balance of busi-
ness interest inclines them. And most of the manu-
facturers and retailers, if not all, are also im-
porters, consequently they cannot speak ill of either
the local or foreign footwear. They are agreed in
testifying to the vast proportion of public pre-
judice against the Australian boot rather than in
favor of it, but nobody is asked to state why the
prejudice arose, or is requested to give convincing
reasons why it should quickly fade and die. Nobody
speaks as a mere wearer of boots from the public
point of view. May I speak ?
Having passed through the stage of acute preju-
dice, I can honestly say that Australian boots were
evil-smelling, roughly-made things 30 years ago. The
smell had hardly abated, but the manufacture was
improving as far back as 20 years ago. Ten years
later the goods were better in all respects, and any
time within the past five years a casual purchaser
might fairly expect to get as satisfactory a pair of
Australian factory boots for £1 as would cost him
fully 12 i per cent, or 25 per cent, more if they
bore a foreign brand. Perhaps the “style and
finish” of the local boots was a trifle less attractive
in the shop, but after a fortnight’s wearing of both
sorts of boots the distinction wore off. Meanwhile
my feet told me, as a rule, that the imported boots
had something wrong in the shape of one or other
of them. They were what I guessed to be a pair of
“throw-outs” —boots that had been rejected by expert
wholesale buyers in the land of their birth, and
were finally foisted upon the Australian importer.
For Australia, a long sea-journey distant from the
lands of cheaper labor, is treated by the far-away
exporter as a Cinderella among nations. She gets
the rejects, the misfits, the new makes of shoe which
failed, and will never become old makes. My ex-
perience in boot-wearing has taught me that, whereas
Australian-made leather was more to blame than the
prirnitiveness of manufacture for the old and once
justifiable prejudice against Australian boots, it is
the want of courage in the manufacturers which per-
mits the prejudice to still exist. Most of them, as
we know, are mixing their business. They do not
lay to their book. They are faint-hearted, un-
patriotic dealers who themselves import the most
expensive boots instead of making them here. Could
there be any surer way of keeping the prejudice
alive than by teaching the public to say, “The best
and most expensive boots are always imported,”
which is naturally misunderstood to mean that all
imported boots are the best value.
The prejudice is accounted for nowadays firstly by
the fact that most Australian boots are not branded,
and secondly by the fact that the local manufac-
turer does not attempt to push the foreigner from
the top branch of the trade. Listen to the testi-
mony of two witnesses who sell a lot of boots and!
shoes in Melbourne. William Huilst says: “Im-
ported goods are only asked for in our city shops.
In the suburbs practically all the boots sold are
locally made.” Whitelaw, who sells in the city
only, says: “We buy the best boots made here. I
think the highest grade of imported boots is a higher
grade than is attempted locally.” Manufacturer
Marshall, when asked whether “there are grades of
women’s shoes that would not be made here, no
matter how high the tariff was,” replied that he
intended to try and manufacture them.
Hitherto the wealthy representatives of Prejudice
have not been given a chance to get cured. The
boots that would be the most costly wherever they
were made have always come from abroad. The
local manufacturer has not ventured to cater for the
most expensive tootsies for the reason that the
Government did not properly encourage him.
The conditions for the local manufacturer are
improving all the time, save only the tariff condi-
tions which were disimproved 10 years ago and have
remained so ever since. Machinery has im-
proved, craftsmanship has improved, everything worth
knowing has been learned by the factories, and
meanwhile the local market has widened and
thickened, and the community at large spends much
more money in boots than of yore. What could not
be done prior to Federation can be done now with
the assistance of High Protection. And when the
very best is done, manufacturers will have no further
cause for doubt re the commercial value of a “Made |
in Australia” brand. The people will ask for it and,
will see that they get it.

The Jammed Doorway.
On a recent Saturday Sydney Telegraph
broke out with words of comfort and balm
of Gilead about the alleged prospect of cer-
tain European countries reducing or abolish-
ing their meat duties, and thus opening new
markets and creating an increased demand
for Australian animals. It is a gaudy
prospect within limitations, and is calcu-
lated to make this country applaud in
moderation and throw up its hat to a height
of two inches, or nearly that much. Take
the case of N.S.W. —the State in which the
Telegraph is specially interested. The ex-
port trade of that State is strictly limited
by the capacity of the port of Sydney, and
by the carrying ability of the final stage of
the railway where all the lines of the coun-
try converge into one at the entrance to
Sydney. No other port is allowed to help
in the business. The meat output is also
strictly regulated by the fact that,
a certain distance, the huge cost of transit,.*
plus the loss of animals in transit, pirn;
again the deterioration through long-e®®--
tinued misery of the animals that are nofc
lost, handicap the business most lamentably*,
even in fertile and well-watered regions:
where the bull flourishes and the jumbuek
is exalted. The mental disease whicbi
sacrifices everything to the bloating of the-
private-landlord-owned city of Sydney fixes:
a rigid limit to the expansion of the cattle-
and sheep, and in a less degree to the wheat:
export of the misfortunate State. Probably;
if France and Germany abolish their meat
import duties more meat will leave Sydney*
but it isn’t likely, under present conditions,
to be because more is produced; it will
simply be because a certain amount W'ill be
filched out of what is now the local supply
of the city, to the further great enhance-
ment of the price of the local chop and
steak and the vast financial elevation of the
sausage. And if the chop and steak rise
again and the sausage goes out of sight in
the welkin, Sydney will only get what it has
been explicitly asking for. Even now the
awful bottle-neck railway and the Darling
Harbor wharves are nearly a year behind,
with the job of shifting the wheat crop in*
many outlying places, so there is little*
margin for a greatly increased bullock and
sheep traffic. There is much periodical fuss-
about ouening up a regular direct trade with
Hull, Bristol and other outlying English
ports so that there may be more ways by
which N.S.W. goods can get into England.,
But the real trouble is to get N.S.W. goods
out of N.S.W., without having them jammed
in the doorway until they go bad.
The Hole-and-Corner Life.
A Sydney family of seven, which resides in
a Redfern stable, recently followed the lead
set by the Holy Family at Bethlehem some
1940 years ago. But whereas Joseph and
Mary only resided temporarily in a stable
because the town was rushed by strangers,
the Sydney family was stabled permanently
on account of chronic artificial congestion.
Joseph of Redfern was not affluent, and his.
money probably wouldn’t tup, to, the sort


house he ought to have had ; also very often
Fhe house is hard to find even when the
™ “ a o es run. A remarkable number of
Sydneyites lead the hole-and-corner life these
days and the whole place contains a faint
suggestion of a new rush, where people live
trees at a high rent, pending the
arrival of the bagging and galvanised iron
for architecture. In fact, Sydney is in a
transition stage. As the one big rai wa
centre, and the only authorised port for gen-
eral foreign trade, it is naturally giowing
fast; and, by reason of the biggest loan boom
in Australian history it is unnaturally grow-
ing faster. A lot of city space is wasted on
disgraceful one- and two-storey shacks, and
that tends to drive people to the outskirts.
So does the natural and laudable objection to
slums and crowded tenement dwellings , feyd-
ney needs six times the space for a given
number of people that some British cities
do. So does the conversion of city dwellings
into shops, warehouses and offices. Add all
these things to the vast increase of popula-
tion, and the fact that the people must move
farther and farther out becomes obvious. At
the same time the sluggishness of communi-
cation through the lack of a network of city
railways and a harbor bridge and tunnel,
makes this moving out; almost impossible,
and the recent rise in tramway and railway
fares hasn’t helped matters. Then there are
difficulties about building sufficient new
houses even where there are convenient spots
to put them on. Wages are higher than they
were, and the loan boom has come so sud-
denly that the supply of some_ kinds
of labor hasn’t kept pace with it.
It would be lamentable if labor had
kept pace, for, if so, there would
be a .fearsome unemployed problem by-and-
bye. Land and materials are both dear by
reason of the boom, and the man who builds
just now, except for purely speculative pur-
poses, and with a view to selling in good time
to a fool, is a rash individual. Another diffi-
culty lies in the fact that the especial kind
of house which the laborer or artisan wants
is just the kind which is threatened with
stringent rent regulation under the Fair
Rents Bill. Then the jerry-builder —the man
who is most addicted to rushing-up rows of
houses at short notice—is seldom very rich ;
the really rich landlord is the one who buys
up bankrupt stocks of buildings when times
are bad. Jerry, the builder, is generally a
man who depends to a considerable extent on
borrowed money. Now even if Jerry could
find land so near the city that houses built on
it would suit the requirements of an artisan
population that is tied to a tram and ferry
service, and even if all the other troubles
were out of the way, and even if the profes-
sional house-manufacturer believed that the
boom will last, he finds it difficult to per-
suade large, important, plug-hatted gentle-
men with the control of money that the boom
will last. They want higher interest and a
bigger margin than of old, when a land and
building deal is mentioned. _ So, though a
vast amount of construction is in progress,
there is very little construction of the cheap
and handy cottage, and the Government
experiment at Daceyville is only a drop
in the bucket after all. And even Daceyville
is in trouble; a recent deputation declared
that the rents were too high, and a harassed
Labor Minister said that the buildings had
cost so much that, even at the present alleg-
edly high rents, the place was a dead loss and
a pauper institution. So the interview ended
to the dissatisfaction of all parties. Pend-
ing developments, a great deal of Sydney
leads the hole-and-corner life, and it can
hardly be otherwise in the circumstances.
—— -♦
In Defence of the Scaddan Government.
From a member of the party:—
“A Westralian Laborite” (B. 25/12/’l3) com-
plains that Premier Jack Scaddan, after being in
office for nearly three years, has done nothing to
give effect to his promise to “down” monopolies ;
and he attempts to prove this by asserting that the
Timber Combine is not giving the timber workers
a fair deal in the stores on its concessions. First,
let me say that the concessions held by this combine
were granted by previous Governments; and, being
legally held, it is beyond the power of Scaddan of
anybody else to cancel them. Not one acre of ground
has been granted to the Combine by the Scaddan
Government. Second, the question of (he price of
stores is a matter which can be, and is, dealt with
by the Timber Workers’ Union. The last agreement
between the Combine and the Union contained a
clause to the effect that the co. was to supply stores
to the men at a price not exceeding 10 per cent,
above the retail price of similar stores in Perth.
This agreement, being registered in the Arbitration
Court, has the effect of law, and the Union can sue
the co. for any breach thereof. Therefore the matter
is entirely beyond the control of the Government.
In regard to monopolies, Scaddan promised to
endeavor to counteract their evil influence by estab-
lishing State enterprises to compete against them.
So far as timber is concerned, since the advent of the
Scaddan Government, one small railway mill, estab-
lished by a previous Government, has been enlarged
and improved; No. 1 jarrah mill has been erected
and in operation for some months. No. 1 karri mill
is just completed. Nos. 2 and 3 karri mills are
under construction, and will be completed and fully
equipped with tramlines, powellising plant, etc.,
before the end of June next. To enlarge one mill
and erect and fully equip four others in 2-i years may
seem slow work to “A Westralian Laborite,” but
still he ought to remember that Scaddan has one or
two other things to attend to.
The Firewood Combine (if there is one) deals
almost exclusively with the mining cos. on the Kal-
goorlie belt. So far there have been no complaints ;
but I have no doubt that if the Chamber of Mines,
which represents these cos., can show that they are
being fleeced by the Firewood Combine, Scaddan
will come to their assistance by dropping down a few
wood lines.
Other monopolies have been attacked in the follow-
ing manner: The South Perth ferries and the Perth
tramways have been bought out entirely. To steady
the shipping ring four steamers have been pur-
chased, and are trading on the South and Nor’-West
Coasts. The Government has contracts to carry King
George’s mails from Albany to Eucla, and from
Fremantle to Port Darwin. The Meat Ring has been
attended to. The State boats carry stock from the
North. State butchers’-shops have been established
in the metropolitan area; and a large estate has
been resumed for the purpose of holding and fatten-
ing stock, so that a regular supply of meat may be
assured. The State brick works will be in operation
next month. Landlordism is not exactly a monopoly,
but rents are very high, and to deal with this, the
Scaddan Government lias introduced workers’ homes;
over 1000 have been built or are in course of erection.
A State quarry has been opened up and equipped, and
is turning out building and road material The
cockies have had a look in. The State agricultural
implement works are nearing completion. Seven and
a half acres have been set -aside for this factory, and
the buildings erected to date cover over two and a
half acres of ground. Machinery is now being sup-
plied to the backbone of the country at a reduction
of 25 per cent, on the prices charged bv Private
Enterprise. It is beginning to dawn on the minds
of some of our farmers and settlers that Freetrade
is not the onlv method of reducing the price of
agricultural machinery.
Shortly after the Scaddan Government took office,
a number of deaths at the Children’s Hospital were
traced directly to the supplies of tubercular milk.
The Government immediately inaugurated a State
dairy ; all public hospitals and similar institutions in
the metropolitan area are now supplied with pure milk
from this dairy, and a very ready sale is found for
the remainder of the produce. In case any citizen
desires anything stronger than milk (and there are a
few), one State hotel has been opened, and three
others are provided for.
There are a few other odds and ends, but we’ll let
it go at that.
“A Westralian Laborite” concludes: “Even a
Labor Government can’t expect us to live for ever
on promissory notes.” The Scaddan Government
was sworn in on October 11, 1911. Allowing Mini-
sters six weeks to hang their hats up and recover
from the shock, they have been two years at work.
In view of the foregoing, 1 desire to express the
opinion that, had all political promissory notes been
as faithfully honored as Jack Scaddan’s in connec-
tion with monopolies, the electors of Australia would
have little to complain of.
Putting the Case for Protection.
The first week’s tariff evidence handed to
the Inter State Commission provided little
public interest, much less excitement. The
boot manufacturers were asking for a fixed
duty in addition to tlje 35 per cent, ad val.,
and put their case strongly, also representa-
tive employees backed them up. One of
these latter said that, though now employed
as a watchman at lower wages than the boot-
makers’ minimum of 545.. he was in reality
better off. on account of the uncertainty and
irregularity of employment in the boot trade.
Another told the Commission something about
the English conditions, against which the Aus-
tralian manufacturers and employees have to
compete with a mere scrap of Protection.
He had had 13 years Cold Country and three
years Australian experience, and he was now
getting 545. per week for doing work that
youths were doing in England for 12s. and
15s. a week. The legal minimum there for
adults was 30s. a week, but “many received
less. They took what was offered; in Aus-
tralia he had never been offered less than the
minimum.” Working conditions here were
superior, methods more economical, and the
factories better equipped. Several manufac-
turing witnesses told of the dodges they had
been compelled to practise “in order that the
retailers might sell their products as im-
ported.” The most relevant witness of the
week’s batch was Charles Aarons, of North
Melbourne, whose weekly output previous to
having Ins factory burned down was 3000
pairs. Faced with, the expense of rebuilding
and equipping his factory, he tried a little
importing, to see if it paid. He found some
difficulty at first in getting supplies, and had
to manufacture 300 pairs weekly, but now
he was purely an importer and found it
more profitable than manufacturing. He
said nothing about his ex-employees’ views on
the matter. At the tail-end of the procession
came the Cabbage Garden’s last and most
hopelessly illogical foreign-trader, W. H.
Renwicic, who professed to speak as “one of
the general public”—the general public that
in Victoria is ten parts Protectionist to one
part Freetrader. The Commission stood him
until he began heaving more or less veiled
insults at the entire race of manufacturers.
Then Chairman Piddington pulled him up
short and desired him to hand in a written
statement of anv facts and figures he might
perchance possess. Judging by its first
week’s public work, the Commission threatens
to justify its appointment, though it has as
yet shown no indecent haste in learning such
facts as it requires.
The Half-Strike.
The latest strike or semi-strike on the Syd-
ney wharves deposited a large piece of em-
phasis upon an already difficult situation. It
was to some extent, a breach of the agreement
to which the strikers were pledged. It was
distinctly a scoff at the law. It was a con-
temptuous repudiation of the plausible and
persuasive ex-Attorney-General Hughes, who
is head of the Waterside Workers’ Union,
for he wasn’t consulted, and when he inter-
fered his only immediate reward was the
glassy stare. The movement embodied an off-
hand setting aside of the elected union offi-
cials —the trusted persons who are supposed
to negotiate with the employers when any
trouble arises. And as for the Labor
majority in the Legislature and the Labor
Government, they were simply ignored. It
was another casual uprising of the rank and
file, and these casual uprisings complicate the
situation badly. Presumably Labor —or at
least Wharf-Labor —doesn’t actually mean to
say that its party is unfit to manage the
country by Parliamentary means, even when
it has got adult suffrage and a big majority;
or that it can’t devise a workable Arbitration
Act; or that it can’t find trustworthy union
officials; or that it can’t run the show in any
way save by industrial civil war. But Labor
-—especially Wharf-Labor —acts too often as
if it did really mean these things. It raises
men to be legislators and union officials, but
a certain tendency to distrust them as bump-
tious and “jumped-up” aristocrats because
thev have bee-n raised, gets in the road of
their usefulness. A notable reason for all-
round preference to unionists is that union-
ism makes for industrial peace, and gives an
opportunity for “collective bargaining.” But
if there is no industrial peace because there
is no really responsible person about a union
ti whom it is possible to propose a durable
bargain, and the unions fail to produce any
such individual, the condition of things
begins to look like united anarchy.
A lamentation appeared in the Sydney
press last week, the same being supplied by
Paddy Quinn. When Nielsen became a
troublesome and cantankerous sort of sup-
porter of the McGowen-Holman State Gov-
ernment, a Parliamentary pair was secured
for him, and he was sent off to the U.S. at
full pay, and £4 per day expenses, to inquire
into the cause of large blue flies, or some
other buzz or horror. The mental struggle
proving excessive, P. Quinn was sent along
to help him inquire into large blue flies.
Then the chief or generalissimo of the expe-
dition came back, and P. Quinn re-
mained, and P. Quinn now reports
that, owing to the influx of oil fuel into
Chili, Australia’s coal export to that coun-
try is greatly endangered. Really, it
hardly seems to be a matter worth weeping
about. Australia hasn’t much coal for its
size, nor has it much water power to take
the place of coal. It will never have any
more coal, and it is never likely to have any
more water power, and these two things con-
stitute modern civilisation. The country
with the last lump of coal seems likely to
rule the world, and the country* which is
the first to sell its last lump of coal will be
dead first. The future lies with the nation
which buys coal and saves its owir supplies;
and the past, and the dead finish and the
corpse lie with the nation which sells its
supplies and has a good time or drunk with
the money. So if some other ass-com-
munity proposes to take the job of selling
its future and its hopes and its irreplaceable
capital and its immortal soul to cook the
dinner-steak of Chili, let it do so. It would
be better for Australia if coal export were
forbidden altogether, and if half the sons of
the present coal-mining community were di-
verted to the job of making boots, hats,
clothes, etc., in order to reduce the disastrous
multitude of our imports. The coal industry
calls for discouragement.

A feeling of bitterness has developed in the
Federal civil service by reason of an official
circular which urges the Federal civil ser-
vant to beware of suspicion while investing
his savings. For instance, he is to avoid
owning large or small areas of land on the
route of Federal railways, and he should not
be interested in companies which are likely
to compete for such orders as his department
has to give. There are some other items, but
these are the most important. And the wife
and children and children’s children of the
Federal official are similarly warned to dodge
the appearance of evil. To which the Fed-
eral civil servant replies in a subdued voice
that his savings and his investments aren’t
big enough to influence or divert the course
of Federal politics, or to muddy the stream of
Federal integrity, especially as some of the
salary increases which were supposed to be
due last July haven’t been paid even yet. By
reason of that disappointment he has aban-
doned his scheme for buying up the Federal
capital site, and his negotiations for 50,000
acres on the Katherine River, which the
Northern Territory railway is supposed to
be making for, have fallen through. What he
is looking for now is a cheap Hebrew from
whom to borrow some money to go on with,
and if the Federal Government will hold an
auction sale of damaged or depreciated He-
brews, who are going at a low figure, it will
thereby acquire much popularity. Incident-
ally, the matter for this par was supplied by
a kindly Hebrew to whom a Federal public
servant had applied for a renewal. The
public servant showed the Government’s let-
ter to Israel by way of explaining the situa-
ation, and Israel agreed with him that it
was hard and bitter “mozzle.”

Does N.S.W. Treasurer Cann habitually
wear his headgear indoors ? This question is
suggested by a hackneyed old remark which
he made last week. It being suggested that
the States should come to some arrangement
so that they won’t all be clamoring for loans
in London at the same moment, to their own
great detriment and the great enhancement
of Cohen, Cann asked if the Federal Trea-
surer was to be the general loan agent, and if
he (Cann) was to go “cap in hand” to that
functionary whenever he wanted to pawn
posterity? It is a well-worn gag, but there
is no sense in it. Cann doesn’t wear a cap
but a hat, and if he is a decent sort of per-
son he will assuredly take off his hat when he
goes indoors to see the Federal Treasurer or
anybody else. He isn’t bound, of course, to
carry the thing in his hand all the time, but
as a matter of common courtesy he would put
it on the floor or the table, or hang
it on a peg. When Cann goes to
see the London money-lender or the
imported Governor he doesn’t tramp
in with his hat on and his umbrella open,
so this inference that it is the last extremity
of degradation to take off his tile when he
drops in at the Federal Treasury is a silly
business. If anyone called on him to take off
his pants and carry them over his arm he
might reasonably complain, but no one sug-
gests anything of the sort. Supposing Cann
must needs wear a cap when he goes to see
the Commonwealth’s chief financier, let him
crowd the article in his pocket. But no-
body asks anything of the sort. There is
no earthly reason why he shouldn’t wear a
belltopper with an ostrich feather in it.
Dryspale Brown, who was a rather lament-
able Vic. Attorney-General during the pre-
vious Watt regime, because of his ill-con-
sidered ways of “taking action,” promises to
be more useful as Minister of Public Health
in the reconstructed Ministry. He wants to
take action to prevent the spread of venereal
disease in Victoria, and is worrying
the Cabinet for the means to “carry
out a satisfactory scheme.” Watt, thus far,
has provided neither scheme nor money.
Probably the Wowsers of his blessed party
object to the mention of venereal disease as
an ill that the body politic is heir to. They
love to howl about the gambling evil, and
the derrink curse, but the sin of permitting
a contagious horror to roam at large is the
sin they approve of. It is under their smug
and silent patronage.

Unobtrusive telegram from Auckland
(M.L.) : —-
The Farmers’ Union has commenced the organisa-
tion of a constabulary corps, for use during indus-
trial unrest. The men are to be formed into com-
panies of 25 in all provincial districts, and are to
be always ready.
Assuming the statement to be true, there are
big possibilities ahead of Maoriland, unless
Premier Massey firmly advises the Farmers’
Union to drop its swaddy foolishness and
get along with its proper business of growing
oats. The trouble is that the special “con-
stabulary corps” idea is liable to spread.
It might, for instance, seize upon the wharf
laborer, and the railway man, and the
miner, and even the peripatetic shearer
might be laid hold of by a patriotic longing
to wave a gun, as a “special,” during times
of industrial turmoil. And he would soon
know as much about the special constabu-
lary profession as any other fellow —as any
cow-merchant, for example. Under these
conditions the next strike would probably be*
interesting—and horribly sudden for the
comparative handful of cocky constables.
“0.C.C.” on the Ladies: —
The other day a poor, unfortunate male got himself
into terribly hot water with a Wimmen’s League, or
Mothers’ Union, in Sydney, because he publicly
alluded to them as mere, plain women, instead of
calling them by that beastly, ill-used, overworked
word, “ladies.” The sexes of this country are divided
into men and “ladies”—though, God knows, the per-
sons who do the “dividing” are about as competent
for their job as pigs to survey a town site.
The first time I saw this miserable differentiation
in all its blatant offensiveness was some five or six
years ago at Coogee (N S.W.), where the surf-bathing
lives and has its drowning. Here the local council,
per the great panjandrum or town clerk, had shoved
up a notice of a JANUS-like description, which read:
T",£Men’s Bathing Place. Ladies’ Bathing PlaceEV“
The use of the silly, snobbish word “Ladies” in
such a way struck me as hilarious and sycophantic,
not to mention absurd, unnecessary and conceived in
the worst of bad taste. Very much the same feeling
overtook me when I read the following in a’ Sydney
daily .the other day:— .
Sergeant Crooks : “And what happened after
that?”
Witness: “I got into holts with the gentleman, and
he gripped me by the throat. During this struggle,
I was carried right into the lady’s bedroom."
“Did anything unusual happen to you just then?”
“The lady hit me over the head with a bottle.
I was knocked out for a time, but when I recov-
ered I gave the lady into custody. After that,
somebody took me to St. Vincent’s Hospital.”
Also, my mind reverted to a saying of the late
Mrs. Lynn Linton, who, when asked by some aspir-
ing Sassietv person whether she did not think that,,
after all. the Shrieking Sisterhood were real “ladies”,
at heart, replied: “England is full of ladies, but,,'-
nowadays, we have very few gentlewomen."
And then I thought of Boulder Poll. This lady
lived on the road between Kalgoorlie and Boulder
(AV.A.) in the early ’9o’s. She was a real lady, in
the broadest sense of the word, and would do any-
thing for anybody—provided they paid her!
When the horse-racing fever broke out, as it die., of
course, almost as soon as Pat Hannan could find
room for a course, there was —also, of course a
“Race Club Ball” held in the township. There were
very few women —beg’ pardon, ladies —there then .
one or two “wives” of certain “big” men ; one o"
two “official” ladies, like the bank manager s wife
and the two barmaids at the pub; three French—
Aunt ’Tildagraph's Soliloquy.
At' a meeting held in Bathurst on Tuesday for the
purpose of forming ,an industrial company, Dr.
Machattie exhorted the good people of that charm-
ing little city to “try and stop the centralisation of
everything in Sydney.” The country, he went on to
say/ is “absolutely run in the interests of Sydney.”
We have no wish to place this strongly-worded state-
ment under a searching analysis.
—Sydney Telegraph.
The metropolis is not in the wrong place. Taking
all its advantages into view, there is no better site
for the metropolis of New South Wales. In the
course of time it is certain that other ports will be
developed, and cities built around them, but it is
just as certain that none of them will eclipse Sydney.
There is no better metropolitan site in all Australia.
Perhaps there is no better site for a business centre
of its class in any country.— Sydney Telegraph.

W’y do they gawk an’ grizzle an’ com-

Thetr ’orrid, little towns is ’ot an’ dusty,
’Cos it don’t orfen rain;
An’ yet they carries on just somethin’ orful,
A-makin’ out as ’ow they are the State,
An’ wantin’ things, wot I ses is unlorf-1 —
I ses: “You’ll ’ave ter wait!”
They ’as the ’ide to tork about pore Sydney,
An’ say as ’ow the place is far too big;
Ugh! I can’t stand that, low-down, common
kidney,
Wot ’as to plough and dig!
Their ’ands is dirty and their ’earts is narrer,
Their ’eads is small, an’ correspondin’
thick;
They never seen our ’Arbor, nor the Yarrer —
They fairly makes me sick !
They forks of industries! My Grashus, ’ear

Wot do they want wiv ’em, I’d like to
know?
Ain’t the Metrollops an’ the papers near ’em?
Ain’t there the Royal Show?
Ain’t there the railways an’ the roads and

All runnin’ inter Sydney, nice and clear?
And ain’t there rates an’ freights an’ fares
an’ taxes,
All payable down ’ere?
And ain’t there markets, yards an’ things

An’ all the offices a-waitin’ ’ard?
And ain’t there po-liss, for to keep decorum,
W’ich all folk must regard?
In course there is! And ain’t there ME

My Goodness ’ow they treat us shameful,

We might as well be down in Tipperary,
For all the good they do!
Onct— years ago—oh, Sairey, me ’eart’s

Onct we was carried on the railways free,
And not a ’aughty, ’ostile word was spoken
Agin us— you an’ me !

WAS A COMPLETE CRIPPLE.
Mr. Charles Lincoln, of Richmond, Tas., was a
complete cripple with muscular rheumatism, and
could not get about. He started using Chamberlain’s
Pain Balm, and after a few applications the pains
were easier and soon left him altogether. He is now
well, is 52 years of age and earning his living
as a general laborer. We hope that sufferers from
rheumatism will not need further evidence in regard
to this liniment.*

er—ladies (just removed from the Boulevard, Cool-
gardie) and several Jap.—ladies-—say, fourteen in
all. There were about 1400 men, and quite 140
would be at the “ball” ; hence any old sort of lady
was in demand. At least, you would have thought
so, but the hon. sec. and committee hesitated at
the Japs, and Boulder Poll — I assume because they
were such perfect ladies. Poll was what the effete
Sydneyites would have termed “a strong joint,” and
the White Australia feeling (I suppose) accounted
for the absence of the Japs., who never protested
against not receiving invitations, being, moreover,
very, very busy in keeping the wolf from their gidyea
and hessian doors. But Boulder Poll was of a
different breed.
Seeking the secretary bn the day of the event,
Poll put her arms akimbo, like her famous proto-
type in Marryat’s song, and reasoned with that
great but hot and nervous personage.
“Wot about a ticket fer me, Mr. Blinkers ?”
“Ticket? My dear Poll, I—er —the committee
will not let me issue you a ticket.”
“An’ w’y the H — not, hey?”
“Oh, well, you wouldn’t like to come, now, I’m
sure, and find all the other —e —er”
Poll cut him short: —
“An’ where the H — ’re yer going to get yer
ladies?”
And the secretary gave in, and Poll was there,
and the other “ladies” were there, and it was a
H —• of a dance! Ah, ladies were ladies then ! They
are, now —only more so.
P.S. —On second recollection, the people who
objected to being alluded to as mere “women” were
not a Wimmen’s League or a Mothers’ Union, but the
Trades Hall (Sydney) folk !
Bill.
The writings of “Henry Horsecollar” :
Sometimes, sad to say, I feel just a little tired of
William 111. of Orange. This person has just been
glorified afresh at certain Anniversary Day gatherings,
and the repetition of him and his magnificence is
almost too frequent.
The House of Orange didn’t exactly ruin the poor
old Netherlands, but its lack of constructive states-
manship gave the Netherlands a chance to ruin
themselves, and they were just aching to do it.
They had an insane Constitution, or rather drove of
Constitutions. When anything was proposed to be
done their High Mightinesses of the States General
thought over it. They referred the matter to the Pro-
vincial Estates, which thought over it, and referred
it to the municipal bodies. They thought over it —
by which time everybody knew of it —and reported
to the Provincial Estates. The latter considered
very heavily, and reported to their High Mightinesses,
the States General. These pondered afresh and re-
ported, or didn’t report, to the Stadholder, who was
a curious elective sort of animal in the earlier days.
That is to say, he was Stadholder of as many of
the Seven United Provinces as chose to appoint him,
while the others ran wild. Consequently it often
happened that part of their High Mightinesses, the
States-General, recognised him as chief and part
didn’t. Nothing was ever done legally except after
at least six months’ thinking, but many big things
were done illegally. The revenue was naturally pre-
carious. The army, in a legal sense, hardly amounted
to anything. And five —some authorities reckon six—-
different admiralties, representing different pro-
vinces, built or didn’t build ships; appointed or
didn’t appoint admirals; and directed or misdirected
naval operations.
That was the law. The reason why Hol-
land had a spell of greatness was that a suc-
cession of rulers shoved the law on one side. Wil-
liam the Silent was a rotten general and very inferior
admiral, and in his time one Spanish soldier was
worth 10 Dutchmen. He never persuaded more than
three of the provinces to stand by him in due legal
form, but his courage wajs tremendous and his
patriotism never failed, so he was a great man despite
his drawbacks. Also, he had the luck to be mur-
dered and made a national saint before his military
incapacity was fully realised. His sons and suc-
cessors, Maurice and Frederick Henry., were the
most remarkable generals of their time, and they
threw the Constitution into the middle of next week
when necessary, and made the republic really great
for a time. William 11. only lasted three or four
years, but he also had little use for the Constitution.
The Grand Pensionary, De Witt— the Orange crowd
being thrown out —carried Holland through the early
naval wars with England in much the same high-
handed fashion, and was executed for being too high-
handed. Then the House of Orange came back, and
William of the Boyne started to pose, with hope-
lessly insufficient means, as the defender of Protes-
tantism in Europe, and made a mess of things. His
hat was too small for him.
The curse of the House of Orange was, as already
mentioned, its lack of constructive statesmanship.
Several members of the family became something
approaching despots, but they never used their power
to repair the hopeless Constitution—if it could be
called one. The disorganised little republic had a
day of importance while its rulers disregarded the
law, but they made no workable new law. When
William 111. died Holland’s heart was broken —also
its back—by the struggle to pose with insufficient
resources, as the boss Protestant State of Europe.
His successors, not being such big men as those
who went before them, respected the Constitution.
The five or six different naval authorities couldn’t
agree, so they ceased to build ships. The seven dif-
ferent military authorities threw bricks at each
other, and the army fell to pieces. The harbors were
nobody’s business, so they silted up. One province
ran the republic into a war with Prussia, by chasing
the Stadholder’s Prussian wife out of its territory,
which included the alleged capital, on the ground
that it (the province) had seceded. Holland lasted
exactly five days in that war, and didn’t fire one
shot that hit anybody. A single city (Amsterdam)
, ran the republic into a war with Britain by making
a,commercial treaty, all on its own, with Britain’s
revolted American provinces. The republic’s com-
merce vanished in that war, and the number of its
ships which passed through the Sound in a year
sank from 4000 to 11, and then to one. One or two
provinces ran it into a war with France in the effort
to turn an honest penny by the sale of contraband
goods to Britain in war time, while the alleged cen-
tral authority lamented and said it could do nothing.
Finally, France annexed the country without even a
decent skirmish being put up by its own people, and
when Napoleon I. was finished with it most of the
able-bodied population between the ages of 20 and
35 had perished on his battlefields, and there was
hardly a copper left in the land. One historian says
that the Hollanders were so hopelessly crushed that for
10 years thereafter a Dutchman hardly dared to look
another Dutchman in the face.
Holland—his own country—hasn’t much use for
William 111. of the Boyne, and Derry and Limerick.
He was the last man, before the great downfall, who
had a chance to save the nation he belonged to, and
he didn’t save it. In fact, he didn’t know how.

Filmer Jesson, M.P., likes his house in
order. His first wife, the sainted Annabel,
was a splendid housekeeper; but when he
marries Nina, the new governess of Anna-
bel’s child, that charming lady refuses to
carry on the traditions of Annabel, and
Filmer has to send for Annabel’s sister to
act as housekeeper. The curious thing is
that Nina stands this arrangement, and in
addition submits to the massive contempt of
the whole of the Annabel relations. But
when Filmer opens a park in memory of the
haloed first wife, Nina, full up of the slights
and insults put upon her, revolts. She re-
fuses to go to the dedication ceremony, and
on Filmer ordering her to attend, she hoists
the red flag of rebellion. She comes down
dressed not in black like the others, but in
the most audacious shade of pink. Then she
makes the discovery, through the inevitable
letters, that Annabel’s halo is in an
extremely battered condition. That lady
had been living in sin with a friend of Fil-
mer’s during her whole married life: the
child was not Filmer’s, but Major Maure-
warde’s. Nina’s natural impulse is to reveal
the damning admissions to the whole family ;
but Hilary, Filmer’s brother, persuades her,
after a strenuous interview, to let him des-
troy the evidence. She hands the letters to
him, and meekly knuckles under to the orders
of the Annabel push. However, their inso-
lence goes too far; Hilary’s indignation gets
the better of him, and he shows the letters
to Filmer. The result is that Filmer clears
the Annabel crowd off the premises, and takes
the meek Nina to his precise heart.
This is the typical Pinero play with which
Hugh Buckler chose to open his welcome
second Sydney season at the Doll’s House in
Castlereagh-street on Saturday evening. It is
an admirable example of the neat, well-made
modern drama, with its “big” scene in its
right place in the third act; its surprise and
its solution admirably led up to and exe-
cuted. It has, too, the invariable Pinero
character, the friend of the family. The
comedy element is slightly caricatured. An-
nabel’s relations, as depicted by Pinero, never
were. The stilted phraseology that clings to
Pinero like a blue-bottle to a surfer is here
cleverly disguised, for in Filmer, the heavy
English parliamentarian, stodgy and preten-
tious speech is in keeping. “His House in

THEATRE, SYDNEY.

Order” is not a great play, but it is an ex-
ample of the highest technical merit of a
style of drama that has served its day.
What, for instance, could be more bare-
faced than the device Pinero uses to intro-
duce his characters? He brings on Filmer’s
secretary and a journalist, whose ignorance
of the man he is about to interview is such
that the secretary has to dictate to him the
names and the spelling of all the chief
characters and to give a brief history of their
relationships. Neither the secretary nor the
journalist play any further part in the
action. They have served their turn.
* * * *
The interpretation is, as usual with this
delightful company, highly intelligent with-
out being inspired. Miss Violet Paget, as
the second wife, admirably suggests her suf-
ferings under the treatment meted out to her
by her predecessor’s family; and her vindic-
tive triumph when the Annabel legend
crumbles within her hands is forcibly ex-
pressed. She makes real a figure that till
then has been impossibly long-suffering. Miss
lempe 1 igott gives another of her incisive
portraits of an old lady. Miss Janet War-
den s conception of the French governess is
cleverly handled ; but Miss Lilian Lloyd, as
Annabel’s is unnoticeable in a colorless
part. Little Kathleen Lindgren, cast for
the character of the priggish child, gets
through a difficult child-part without dis-
aster ; but she shows nothing beyond evi-
dences of careful schooling. Doubtless her
nervousness will disappear on further
acquaintance with the stage. Of the men,
Alfred Bristowe’s too precise enunciation,
pardonable as it is in the character of Filmer,
recalls too clearly his brilliant work as the
Frenchman in “Fanny’s First Play.” In the
clumsy scene, surprising in a Pinero play
where the same letters have to be read for a
third time on the stage, crude facial contor-
tions fail to express his emotions. Gerald
K. Souper has little to do; Arthur Cornell
does his best to suggest the impossible father
of Annabel; and Kenneth Brampton, as the
dreadful Pryce, shows us the bounder in
action with popular effect. Reginald
Wykeham gives a convincing characterisa-
tion of a genial mayor. As the charming
Hilary, Hugh Buckler has a part to his, and
the audience’s, liking. His ease, his com-
mand, his humor, his pleasant personality,
are expressed with absolute aplomb; and in
the scene in the third act his earnestness and
fervor are most dramatically conveyed. “His
House in Order” deserves a long run.
“Officer 666” is still on duty at Sydney
Criterion.
Beaucaire Waller is still winning Lady
Mary Titlieradge regularly every evening, at
Sydney Royal. It is the right sort of wea-
ther for frosty beauties, and the very name
of Bath has a pleasant sound when the
electric fans are flickering in the darkened
auditorium. Writer has often wondered
what would happen if one of the things flew
off and spanked a stout lady 35 times on her
powdered pillow-back.

The new names on the Sydney Tivoli pro-

of Rose and Ellis and the Graus Bros., the
former a pair of sensational barrel-jumpers
and the latter experts in the art of balancing

to picture the hopeless state of a world in
which nobody could jump from one barrel
into another or twirl himself on the crest
of a clothes _ prop?) Among others who
have been introduced before are Gene
Greene, Du Fra, the Five Merry Young-
sters, Romanos, Josephine Davis and the
Schmettans, and they all go towards making
an exceptionally good programme.

What’s What among the Sydney moving
pictures this week :
Crystal Palace: “Wiffles— His Mother’s Darling,”
a yarn of a law student who preferred girls to law,
and was aided and abetted thereat by a gay, bache-
lor tutor. Naturally made a rotten lawyer, and pro-
bably became a member of Parliament.
Lyric : “Giant Circumstances,” w'herein flimsy
circumstantial evidence (such as being found in a
dark lane with five revolvers, three jemmies, one
mask, 16 gold watches and a bloodstain) is unkindly
dealt with.
Colonial : “A Waif of the Desert,” showing how
circumstances alter things. When the waif is on his
uppers no one notices him ; then he strikes luck, and
finds that two-thirds of the population has been his
best friend all along.
Empress : “The Trail of the Lost Chord,” which
might be a story of bloodhounds and black-trackers
on the scent of a Dago and a barrel-organ or might
not. You can find out to-night for 3d.
Lyceum: “When the Earth Trembled,” an excellent
film, bringing in some good pictures of the San Fran-
cisco earthquake.
Glaciarium and Olympia: “At the Convent Gate,”
concerning a girl who is rescued by nuns and spends
the rest of the film in a convent.
Imperial : Take your choice of a good lot.

The White City, Sydney’s new big out-
door amusement park, is making a fine sea-
son of it, although it is early to say that
the speculators will come out of the expen-
sive venture profitably. Still, if they lose
their money they have the satisfaction of
knowing that they gave the public a good
show, and, as any silver-lined speculator
knows, it is better to give than to receive.
Sister Esmeralda, who can trim the xylo-
phone in style, is back again at the National
Amphitheatre (Sydney), and her. skill,
added to the banjo-playing talents of Brent
Hayes, makes the Fuller-Brennan pro-
gramme strong on the instrumental side.
Also, there is plentv of good-enough sing-
ing (ragtime and other brands) this week,
and the Lyrical Four (newcomers) reckon
they have brought their tunefulness, to a
hungry market. The maniac bull-dogs are
still being aimlessly hauled up to the dome
of the music-hall while hanging to a rope
with their teeth. Considering the uses a
few infuriated bull-dawgs might be put to
in political circles it seems a lamentable
waste of material to let them get the death
grip on to a mere rope. Likewise, there is
a Red Indian wasting his leisure singing
ballads when at no time in our history was
a reliable scalper so urgently required.
Things are far from what they ought to be.
William Anderson’s American burlesque
co. will change the menu on Saturday" at
Sydney Palace. “A Day at the Races” will
be crossed out and “The Grafters” written
in. The dream song of the hoboes will be
part of the entertainment, but the prices of
admission will not be raised.
Fantomas, the international villain, ap-
peared again at Spencer’s Melbourne pic-
ture-house on Saturday, and as usual left a
deposit of corpses before finally escaping
into the dark. “A Homespun Tragedy”
was next-best to the main suit, and demon-
strated that Lovely Woman’s fondness for
vicarious sacrifice is a dangerous habit when
carried too far. Next Saturday “Tess of
the D’Urbervilles” will be Charles Spencer's
chief guest, with the Amurkan actress, Mrs.
Fiske, in the part of Tess, the daughter of
Durbeyfield.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The gallant Colonel, grey and old, brought
sorrow to his life,
By asking Miss De Beauvrais bold to be his
lawful wife,
His awful lawful wife.
A villain, who pursued his end with cruel
sneers and snarls,
Was Miss De Beauvrais’s dearest friend —he
bore the name of Charles,
The artless name of Charles.
Jack Brown, beloved of Nancy Lee, was won-
drous good and kind:
A virtuous young maid was she; her Dad,
alas ! was blind —
Well, sometimes he was blind.
The Villain meant to buy their home; his evil
end to gain,
He would have sent them forth to roam in
poverty and pain,
But Jack was never known to fail, and, by
a lucky chance,
When “dear old Home” went up for sale he
bought it in for Nance.
(A straight-out bid for Nance.)
Then Charles the Schemer and his “tart,” the
hopes of Jack to mar,
Arranged that she should play the part of
Mrs. Potiphar.
Their foolish try
Was baffled by
A comic burg-u-lar.
Blind Dad no longer felt his way, like boozers
in a fog.
(On auction-day a barmaid gay had bought
for him his dog—
A blind man wants a dog.)
The dear old home to him looked bright,
which formerly was dark.
(Blind Dad’s recovery of sight had called for
no remark—
No, not the least remark).
Once more the guilty pair of brutes were on
the hero’s track :
They killed the Colonel in his boots: they
shot him through the back,
And charged the crime to Jack.
The comic burglar formed a plan for win-
ning Jack’s release;
Together with a soldier man, disguised as the
Police,
He struck a Sherlock Holmesy air, and, in
this fancy dress,
He interviewed the guilty pair and forced
them to confess
Their sin and wickedness.
So they were hanged and no one wept, no
tear for them was shed:
For all the rest were glad, except the Colonel,
who was dead.
Poor Colonel, he was dead !

HOW TO NEUTRALISE DANGEROUS
STOMACH ACIDS.
Few people besides physicians realise the
importance of keeping' the food contents of
the stomach free from acid fermentation.
Healthy normal digestion cannot take place
while the delicate lining of the stomach is
being inflamed and distended by acid and
wind —the results of fermenting food in the
stomach. To secure perfect digestion, fer-
mentation must be stopped or prevented,
and the acid neutralised. For this purpose
physicians usually recommend getting a
little bisurated magnesia from the chemist
and taking half a teaspoonful in a little hot
or cold water immediately after eating.
They recommend bisurated magnesia be-
cause it is pleasant to take, has no disagree-
able after-effects, and instantly stops fer-
mentation, neutralises • the acid and makes
the sour, acid food bland, sweet and easily
digested.
The regular use of bisurated magnesia—
be sure you get the bisurated, as other kinds
of magnesia are of little value —is an abso-
lute _ guarantee of healthy, normal digestion,
for it overcomes and prevents that acid con-
dition which alone is the cause of trouble.*
AN EFFECTIVE REMEDY.
Laxo-Tonic Pills are a most effective remedy for
cleansing the blood, thus removing the cause of
pimples, blotches and other blemishes. Price, IOJd.

absurdity of “The Soldier’s Wedding” is
amusing, and very little of it is as tiresome

The hardy annual at Her Majesty’s (Mel-

than the bursts of approbation in the even-
ing, but that is the only difference.

The same remarks apply more or less to
“The Land of Nod,” at Melbourne King’s,
where the evenings and the matinees are in
their sixth edition.
A revival of “Man and Superman” will

the crinoline of long ago, and a meekness of
female modesty which belongs to an imag-
inary period, will be reintroduced into
“Milestones.” The pretty little comedy of

the Mouse” on February 7.
The Melbourne Opera House bill took in
the Pasquali Bros, last Saturday, when the
work of those bounding and balancing
brethren, though lacking in grace, was thank-
fully received. The turn is remarkably
clever. Clemons and Dean have made good,
also Hawley the Bandit continues to com-
mand resDect for his impersonation of Al-
fonso Spaghoni, the outlawed brigand
since his wife had been stolen away by
a mean dog. Barton and Ashley are play-
ing a new sketch which is mostly puerility.
Other people are as before, and the near
approach of Josephine Davis is loudly pro-
claimed by the management.

A sustained rise in the temperature of
late has been a mighty stimulus to business
at Branscombe’s airy establishment on St.
Kilda (Vic.) Esplanade. The Dandies
warble as melodiously as ever, and frivol
with good average results. One of the best
items last week was Claude Dampier’s pun-
gent singing of ‘‘Captain Gingah,” and on
the sentimental side of the programme the
Barcarolle duet of Evelyn Ward and Hilda
Lane deserves honorable mention. After
which it only remains to say that discreet
praises of the third lady (Irene Vere) and
the other three men can be taken for
granted.

days the Tivoli itself also gets busy, rag-
time competitions being a sure draw. The
King’s scores consistently with brand-new
turns, mostly American. The Ilubanik Co.
snecialises in tabloid opera. The voices
are excellent, and the opening piece, deal-
ing with California before the Yankee came,
is a complete novelty. The Troutt man and
mermaid eat and drink and do fancy sewing
under water. It is a marvellous feat of
breath-holding, and in a bigger tank might
be graceful too. The Royal remains closed.
Branscome’s Dandies are at the Exhibition,
and the seaside places are beginning to put
up similar costume companies with some suc-
cess. West’s are showing how Joan of Arc
would have looked if she hadn’t looked the
way she did look, and Wondergraph still
relies on its Lady Bathers. There is no
handicap in this competition beyond such
as Nature imposes, and one competitor has
made the res t : look Also Rans.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“First Nighter”: Seldom have I distilled more
quiet joy from anything than 1 did from “M.L.’s”
remarks (B. 22/l/’l4) on the subject of revues, him-
self and myself—more particularly myself. It is
this sort of thing that makes inkslinging worth
while. The value of “M.L.’s” work lies chiefly in
the artless' self-revelations with which it teems.
Pepys himself never did Anything better in a couple
of dozen lines. I saidj in the first place, that
“M.L.” was obviously an Englishman. I am now
in a position to describe, on his own evidence, the
exact sort of Englishman that he is. He is no longer
young. (Mark the pathetic pride of eld contained in
the phrase, “I’ve been too long at this game of pen
and ink,” etc.) He is also fat. —majestically so, in
all likelihood. (I deduce this from the fact, that
he goes out of his way to term me “small” —an
accusation that to the mind of the Briton of full
habits cuts off all controversy at the meter, and leaves
the possessor of normal size in stomachs writhing
in his argumentative gore, as it were. To this
class of controversialist to call Lloyd-George “a little
Welsh attorney” is tantamount to pushing a full cup
of hemlock down his throat.) “M.L.” has the illite-
rate’s vast capacity for rage and infuriated language,
allied to the Englishman’s immemorial inability to
understand that he is troubled with either of these
diverting characteristics. When a stout, irascible
Briton assaults a foreigner, or other outcast, he is
scandalised at the idea of being assailed in return.
It causes him to regard the enemy as a Scoundrel,
a Disloyalist, a Bounder and a person of low moral
character. And so it is with “M.L.” He began our
little discussion by snuffling at a revue idea of mine.
I suggested that he was an Englishman and a
Wowser. His superbly proud though somewhat
illogical counterstroke is that “he declines to play
Slurk to my Potts” ; that I am either (1) a “foot-
man” or (2) a “bell-boy” ( and that, anyhow, I am
“a wandering ass” and “a small, irritable amateur.”
How the blasphemy laws would have been fractured,
to be sure, had this genial old patriarch laid himself
out to be what he would consider really Slurkish!
But where “M.L.” is most English is, of course, in
his shrinking horror of “the peculiar morality of the
English public school.” I never yet met the pro-
duct of a London Board School who wasn’t prepared,
at the briefest notice, to cant for hours on “the
peculiar morality of the English public school.” To
uninstructed bigots of the clamantly righteous order
public schools, nunneries, universities and a number
of other places of which they have no personal know-
ledge whatever are Dens of Infamy. In them are
sapped the foundations of the nation’s moral pre-
eminence. The Board School Briton puts such in-
stitutions in the same loathly category as Paris and
Rome and Gehenna —where, as every God-fearing
Englishman knows, Vice walks naked and unashamed
owing to the mad license that is permitted by a
Government of degraded foreigners. There is no
sense in “M.L.” trying to pull my leg any further.
He cannot disguise himself. Born in Olapham, and
semi-educated at the nearest Board School, he be-
came, at an incredibly early age, one of the pillars
of the local Methody' Chapel. Tit-Bits starred him
in 1892 as the Youngest Church Elder on record. For
years he has been telling people all about the wicked-
nesses that go on in Continental Europe and at
English public schools. The habit of sniffing out
largely non-existent infamies has become chronic
with him now. He is really one of the commonest
types that the M.L. (i.e., Mother Land) produces.
“C. Ockney”: The versatile James M. Glover, who,
in addition to being Drury Lane’s musical conductor,
is an ex-provincial mayor and present provincial
theatre-manager, also a musical critic and a very
freelance journalist, tells some piquant yarns in his
second volume of reminiscences, “Jimmy Glover and
His Friends.” He may have had many “friends”
before he wrote it, by the wav, but “acquaintances”
is the word by now. English sassiety actaws, f’rin-
stance, won’t thank “Jimmy” for giving the show
away concerning the “Royal Command” perform-
ances. A “command” performance is popularly sup-
posed to be a signal mark of royal favor—a supposi-
tion nurtured by the terriblv-loyal press agent. But
now comes this horrible disclosure: “The King does
not command the actor at all, but the agent or
manager, in a business way, is ordered to provide
certain entertainments, for which he sends in a bill
like anv other tradesman.”
“Snell”: Our great dailies never trouble them-
selves about “true Art” until some section of Aus-
tralian art-workers turns out to battle for a measure
of protection. At such time the Argus in particular
becomes suddenly devoted to “true Art,” and is most
impressive preaching the cosmopolitan nature of
“true Art.” For instance, the Australian vaudeville
performers, who sing a bit and dance a bit and
tell a wheeze or two, cannot look for any assistance
through unionism, or in any other way, because “true
Art” is cosmopolitan. In the same way, Australian
newspapers must not be debarred from cribbing half
their general matter, and buying cheap stories
through English and American syndicates, because
Art” is the same old cosmopolitan. The great
danyl doesn’t care a dump what “true Art” is pro-
vided it never gets a chance of being Australian.
“0. Ockney”: Bernard Shaw is not the only
dramatist in the family. The missus has recently
stepped into the limelight with a play to which she
has given the elegant title of “Woman on Her
Own.” This piece, which is an adaptation (or,
rather, as Mrs. “G. 8.5.” modestly describes it, a
“translation”) of Eugene Brieux’s “La Femme
Seule,” was recently done at the Coronet —a play-
house in the Nottinghill Gate suburb of London.
Those responsible for the show were a bevy of ex-
leading ladies and other more or less responsible
players who call themselves “The Actresses’ Franchise
League,” and who cast themselves for the leading
female characters, of which there are many. A lady
“producer,” Jannette Steer, staged the piece, which
was received with enthusiasm. Mere man was allowed
to help—there are several male parts in the drama
which could hardly be played by women. Also, the
brute was allowed to pay to go in. I didn’t hear of
Prime Minister Asquith or Chancellor Lloyd George
taking advantage of the occasion and pelting the
stage with borak and other vegetables; and they’re
both ardent theatregoers, too.
From London: There is a “Whimsical Walker” in
London, a clown of 50 years’ standing, who is cele-
brating his jubilee in the Christmas panto, at Drury
Lane. In the course of his reminiscences he claims
to be the holder of an Australian record. He was
once engaged for a six-months’ Australian tour, but
remained for only a single week. That was because,
on landing in Sydney, he found a cable message
from Drury Lane commanding him to come back at
the earliest possible moment to fill a gap caused by
the sudden passing-out of another performer. There
was no steamer available for a week, so he played
for six nights in Sydney, and then started on his
return voyage. But the “whimsical” gentleman is
too cocksure about his “record.” There have been
other English performers whose appearance in Aus-
tralia was limited to a single night, and they would
not have lasted as long as that if the managers
had been as wise the day before as they were half
an hour after.
Just dead in New York, Percy Denton, who was the
original corpulent Doc. Sniffkins of “The Belle of
New York” in Australia, where he remained for 10
years. He was first here in ’79, after which he
became one of the Moore and Burgess minstrels in
London.
Reported in American vaudeville papers that “May-
bel'le” Morgan, “the Australian nightingale,” is
bringing her fine principal boy figure back to this
country. Her last show in America was to have been
as prima-donna with the Bowery Burlesquers at
Chicago.
“0.L.”: Spencer’s offer of £2O as first prize for
a photo-play came as a wild surprise fo Australian
writers, who are unused to such generous treatment
—outside newspaper offices, which, it is said, pay
more for printed matter than any other journals in
the world. The lucky winner of the £2O will not,
of course, participate in any of the profits made by
the film co. supposing the photo-play should be a
boom; but, then, he has simply to sit down and
think of something that has never been done before,
and his work is finished. He can, in fact, sit down
and live on the money till the next big prize is
offered. It has been printed that an Italian cinema,
firm has offered £lOOO as first prize for a photo-
play. This, of course, is a gross exaggeration. In
the first place, even if there was so much money in
Italy, nobody who won it would know how to spend
it, and would either die from a rush of spaghetti to
the stomach or be killed by the Black Hand Society.
It would seem, therefore, that we must still regard
Spencer’s £2O as the most generous genuine offer on
record.
Phil Wirth talks of producing some circus dramas
in Sydney shortly. Possibly the time is ripe for a
revival of Dick' Turpin and other heroes of the time
when a masked fugitive on horseback ran no risk of
being ignominiously headed by four policemen in a
motor-car. The weakness of circus drama is in its
round-and-roundness. A theatre setting gives the
imagination of the audience a chance to travel over
alleged miles of invisible country with a hunted
highwayman who has just trotted off at the wings.
But the arena is a cold, stern reminder that the
nnth of glory leads only to the place where it began.
The field of action is too circumlocutory.
“Joseph and His Brethren” will come to light in
Australia at Melbourne Royal in the middle of
February. Ethel Warwick is to play Mrs. Potiphar,
whilst the other principals, mostly, are making their
first appearances hereabouts. The Joseph of the cast
—Malcolm Tearle —comes of old theatrical stock.
His father, the late Osmond Tearle, was a somewhat
famous actor in his day (The Bulletin has men-
tioned him as the original Silver King in New York),
and ;son Malcolm got a good footing in the purfesh
whilst he was still a lad.
The Williamson firm is always busy, more or less,
with panto, arrangements. This year’s panto, is only
at the outset of its public career, but already the
Firm is cabling to London re the production of
“Cinderella” next Christmas. The engagement of
artists for the chief parts is being discussed. Early
discussion of that subject seems very necessary, seeing
that three of the imported people Who appeared in
the present panto, on the first night have ceased to
appear at all.
“Norbell” : It is curious to read that “Joseph and
His Brethren” is to be imported, lock, stock and
barrel, from London, with an English co., and an
English “producer”—a producer being a kind of
conjurer who says “Presto !” and things immediately
materialise. Maud Williamson, now in England,
mentioned in a recent Poverty par. that the scenario
of this hew “Joseph” play is practically identical
with George Rignold’s great Australian production of
the Rev. George Walters’s play on the same subject.
And Maud is quite qualified to make comparisons, as
she was leading woman in the Rignold show. Mr.
Walters’s version, however, was interdicted in London,
and it remains to be seen whether the imported ver-
sion will eclipse Rignold’s spectacular effort. There
has been more than one notable production in these
parts that was inhibited in London. Years ago
Rossini’s opera of “Moses in Egypt” was done in
Australia with a very fine cast, real fire from
Heaven and much pomp and several circumstances:
but Mose was severely told to keep off the British
grass.
A good idea, which could easily be copied here for
any Charity performance, was an Old Song revival
at the Alhambra (London), for the Mirror’s Christ-
mas pudding fund. In nearly every case they were
able to get the original singers. Margaret Cooper
was quite modern with “Waltz Me Round Again,
Willie.” Less so were Gus Elen, “A Great Big
Shame” ; Peggy Pryde, “Sally’s Wedding-day” ;
Huntley, “Algy’s Awf’ly Good at Algebra”; and
Louie Freear, “Sister Mary Jane’s Top Note.” The
farthest-back were Tom Costello, “At Trinity Church
I Met My Doom”; Coborn, “Two Lovely Black
Eyes”; and Courtice Pounds, with the hackneyed
pair of Sparkling ditto. Of course, if the idea were
copied in Australia, the question of getting the
original singers not arising, one could go much
further back, and dig up “La-di-dah” or “In the
Gloaming.” There are lots of people to-day to
whom the saccharine wail of “Just Before the Battle,
Mother,” would come as a delightful novelty—well,
as a novelty, anyway.
English play-writers—always the most sheep-like
among authors —have accepted the idea that the
name of a revue must necessarily be something
colloquial and jerky. The very latest titles are
“Who’s Got It?” “Nicely, Thanks,” “I Should Say
So,” “Keep Smiling,” and “And Very Nice, Too.”
A big thing projected for New Year at London Em-
pire capped all of these with “Yes; Let’s ”
Some 70 or 80 years a rr o, English racehorse owners
got a similar weird idea for giving odd names.
“Here I Go with My Eye Out” was the worst of the
titles unfortunate geegees had to race under till
the fad waned. The same sort of fad once afflicted
novelists, and they wrote books with boa-constrictor-
like designations that had to be coiled up to save
space—affairs like “Can You Forgive Her?”; “He
Knew He Was Right”; “Ought We to Visit Her?”;
and even “What Will He Do with It?” All these
devices were horrible and ought to have been boiled.
“Giovanni”: Fred Dyer, a British welterweight
of a certain amount of class, is proving himself to
be a versatile sort of pug. at the British Halls. He
sings ruthlessly a tenor ballad, hight “Come, Sing to
Me,” then he burlesques an Italian operatic star ; and
follows with exhibition spars with members of the
audience. A sound scheme this of taking on men
after he has sung to them. It is tantamount to forc-
ing them to give away a couple of stone. Later, he
gives a heart-to-heart talk to women, on “How to
Attain Perfect Health and Beauty of Figure.” In
the course of his helpful little chat he stands on the
back of his neck and describes geometrical diagrams
in the air with his legs. If the management only
agree to raise his salary a bit, he is ready to con-
duct a religious service; give an exposition of “The
Ring and the Book” ; solve any six anagrams handed
up to him from the body of the hall; and introduce
a team of performing hyenas that he apprehended
and trained with his own hands. Fred, in fact, is
one of the World’s Workers, and not ashamed of it,
either.

QUERY: How did he charm the Tango Girl?
“0.K.”: Somebody suggests that “the drivel of
platform speech” is responsible for the emptiness a.nd
stupidity of social conversation these times. The thepry
that private talking is what public talking makes' it
may have a particle of foundation in fact. Judging from
literary records of the table-talk and coffee-house
talk of long ago—taking even Dean Swift’s “Polite
Conversations,” which were a satire on the fashion-
able babble of his period—people of the educated
and somewhat educated classes formerly put more
thought into their gossip than is the rule nowadays.
Silly catch phrases had not come into vogue. No
person could maintain a character for ordinary intel-
ligence by a continuous output of such expressions
as “Gohon,” “Take a rest,” “Oh, dry up,” “You’re
the one,” “Mother will be pleased,” etc. But the
men whose public utterances are reported in the press
cannot be blamed for the foolishness of exclamatory
conversation. Probably public speaking has been
demoralised by the influence of journalese. The un-
grammatical wordiness of hastily-written newspaper
paragraphs, with their stereotyped aphorisms and
mixed metaphors, accounts for the dulness of the
average politician’s platitudes. With the spread of
journalism the art of public speaking declined—i.e.,
it has been losing grace and dignity of form and
strength of thought. (Meanwhile the old patient
genius for great “poetic” work has ceased even to
have claimants. Tennyson and Swinburne were: at
their best prior to the birth of the first ha’penny
newspaper, after which poets became verse writers.)
Journalism may be held accountable for much of the
difference between the speech-making of Alfred Dea-
kin’s time and the oratory of Edmund Burke’s
rounded period. All the same, neither the newspaper
nor the spouter is blamable for the hideous chatter
and exchange of repartee that passes for conversation
at picnic, darnce or mixed-bathing party. Music-
hall songsters, patterers and “sketch” artists, not for-
getting the exponents of musical comedy, are the pub-
lic speakers who supply the bulk of the material for
impolite conversation in these > brainless circles. (If
a bloke didn’t walk on to the stage and say: “Well,
’ow about it?” to the audience, the audience would
not treasure the gag as a masterpiece of wit.) The
stupidity of social conversation radiates from the
theatre. The theatre, according to the J. C. William-
son management, exists to supply public wants.
“Gags” and “wheezes” and pints of “piffle” are sup-
plied, and the public packs these things up in its
mind and takes them home. Yet there is still a
doubt as to whether the public really wants every-
thing it takes.
“Stargazer”: I am so unfortunately situated that
I must perforce see a great deal of the actor going
home. He goes home in bunches, and when it isn’t
him it’s her. I think she is more like a flock of 50
excited geese than he is, and he is so clamorous
about his own business that if all other men were
equally vociferous in bawling their affairs the world
would be saved from idiocy only by a sudden and
blessed deafness. When the crowd is composed of
him and her it is more than ever like a riot among
millhands and an outbreak of mad barbers, and all
the time the noisy talkers are telling each other
over and over again what the recipient of the infor-
mation must know already, and what the latter can’t
hear, anyhow, because he is too loud in conversation
himself. By comparison, the homing cockatoo is an
emblem of studied silence; noise does not really
begin till the actors homeward fly. And if they
are American actors (too often of late they are
American actors) you have -your option—you can
stay and be talked into a state of general debility
relieved with fits, or you can fall off the train. It
is my habit to fall off the train.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Late I was parted from my dear,
And all my days went drearily ;
Then, first, it was my cheerful chance to hear
“The Rosary,”
My Ro-ser-ree!
First when I sat, at night, alone,
In mournful cadence came to me,
Moaned from my next-door neighbor’s gramophone,
“The Rosary,”
My Ro-ser-ree!
Next morning, as I wandered round,
Sadly, through blighted Bloomsbury,
One with a barrel-organ grimly ground-
“ The Rosary,”
My Ro-ser-ree!
Then, on my next best girl I called,
•For solace for the other She; —
She touched her cottage-grand, and sighed and
squalled
“The Rosary,”
My Ro-ser-ree!
Wildly to gilded halls I fled,
To drown my pain in gaiety ;
The bleating band struck up (or strike me dead)
“The Rosary,”
My Ro-ser-ree!

At midnight. Lo I—a1 —a note for me,

“Norbell”: Fremantle Gaol (W.A.) has
again been distinguishing itself. The last
time it did anything of the sort was when,
at the instigation of the visiting P.M., it
flogged two prisoners for climbing over _ the
gaol wall —a thing which any prisoner might
reasonably be expected to do if he saw the
chance. Now, in pursuance of the same
policy of thoroughness, the head of an
offender has been jerked completely off his
shoulders in the process of hanging. The
information came to hand only a couple of
days after the actual happening, as the
Fremantle gaol officials jealously guard the
secrets of their prison house, and blush to
find them fame; wherefore newspaper re-
porters are excluded from the hangings—
and there are more hangings in Westralia
than in any other State. The official reason
for the modesty which excludes the reporters
from witnessing the officials’ triumphs is
that sens-ation isn’t good for newspaper
readers. It is, however, popularly supposed
that a more cogent reason is that the sensa-
tions are too lurid for publication. A few
years ago, when a malefactor was being
executed, a very zealous chief warder was
superintending the operation. His profes-
sional enthusiasm caused him to linger on
the drop too long after the signal to “let
go” had been given, and the condemned man
and the official disappeared simultaneously.
The criminal was killed, and the official
badly shaken. After that reporters were
warned off. The spectacle of a bruised
chief warder with a broken collarbone, lying
on his back in the sawdust at the bottom of
the pit, was considered too thrilling. The
present superintendent of the gaol advocates
electrocution.

“A III.”: Away in the land of the
Japanee the people have acquired the knack
of making bigger things than paper flowers
and little silk flags to deck Australian ban-
quet tables. Recently they launched the
Ivatori Maru, a passenger steamer of 10,000
tons. Every rivet even was made in Japan.
Now, how many 10,000-ton liners have we
building in Sydney? In Australia? A week
or so after that liner took to the water,
Bruce Smith’s friends put the Kirishima
('27,000 tons) and the Harona (27,500) in
for a mixed bathe. The first is a battleship,
sister of the Kongo, built by Vicars-Maxim,
the latter doubtless used by the brown
plagiarist as a model. The Karona, a
cruiser, with eight 14in. guns and a huge
secondary battery, would make our own Aus-
tralia look something like a marked-down
draper’s window. Still, the land we live in
is full of iron, limestone, manganese, etc.
Also we have a decent model or two to
copy. It only remains for that great war
lord. Milieu, to get busy—when he has
settled the urgent kilt question—and all
may yet be well. Still I wish the Japs had
stuck to their good old Yoshiwara industry.

The United States Court of Appeal has
confirmed a Judge’s decision that there was
no “moral turpitude” in the libelling of
George V. by Edward Mylius, the man who
accused his Maj. of a secret marriage with
an Admiral’s daughter. The extraordinary
thing is that any U.S. Minister of State
should ever have deported Mylius on the
ground that there was moral turpitude in
the publication of the libel. The story was
so old, and age had made it look so respect-
able, that Mylius doubtless supposed it to
be true. In stating that a king had married
AND THE WEDDING WAS
POSTPONED.
SHE: “What did father say when you loli him you had money saved?”
HE: “He borrowed most of d?"
SHE : “ Ah, I heard him tell mother that yeu were too soft!"
a young woman secretly in his salad sailor-
days, he was simply uttering the same sort
of criminal libel — no worse and no better—
than is uttered by any scandalmonger about
any sort of citizen every day of the week,
Gossipers are mostly engaged in talking ill
of somebody, on misinformation received;
and were they all to be convicted as Mylius
was. and then officially declared to be guilty
of ‘ moral turpitude,” immigration in the
Land of E reedom would practically cease,
The fact is, Edward Mylius was singled out
for persecution because he had libelled a
king. Ilis alleged infamy lay not in the
character of his offence, but in the quality”
of the libelled personage; wherefore the L.S.
Secretary of Labor and Commerce, who
ordered the mans deportation, was acting
as a mere flunkey to British aristocracy.
MOMENT OPPORTUNE.
MADEMOISELLE: “ You promeesed to take me to ze Vowsaie meeting ven I had not ting
much on. Take me to-night.”
“Nestor”: Apropos “The Toll of the Surf”
headline, now almost “standing matter” in
the Sydney daily press. Why do our au-
thorities not adopt the European method?
Here it is, as may be seen on any Conti-
nental beach. The sauvetage (life-saving)
boats patrol the waters just outside the
breaker-line. If a bather passes the breaker-
line, a trumpet is sounded for his return.
If he persists, he is followed and arrested.
They don’t allow people to lose their lives and
risk other lives through pure angora fool-
ishness. Life is too valuable. If the patrol
boats cannot go out, then the surf is danger-
ous and the bathers are forbidden to go in.
Consider the difference between this simple
method and all the fuss and feathers of life-
saving on our beaches. The dramatic
alarm, the rush with the reel, the picturesque
paying-out of the line, the heroic leader with
the lifebelt, the smaller fry helping, the
crowded spectators encroaching on the pic-
turesque workers, the lady admirers of the
heroes, the photographer, the descriptive
writer —and the victim drowning all the
time! Had the patrol boat been there, and
no one allowed in the surf save under its
protecting wing, the dailies might have the
headline “Toll of the Surf” melted down,
for the sensational rescues and unsensational
drownings would be things of the past.
The Weary State has apparently become
partially suffused with the spirit of the late
Jenkins, and is “doing the thing properly”
as regards railway electrification. It got
Merz’s information and advice, at a high
figure, but finding that imported genius had
made an initial blunder, it is sending its own
officers abroad periodically, in order to “be-
come fully acquainted with the construction
and control of up-to-date electric systems.”
Thus Chief Commissioner Fitzpatrick has
just returned from a visit to Europe and
America, while the chief electrical engineer,
the superintendent of goods traffic and the
engineer for signalling have also “made in-
vestigations abroad on behalf of the depart-
ment.” Next month the acting-secretary and
the superintendent of passenger traffic will
proceed round the world to “familiarise
themselves with modern electric railway
matters,” and after they return it is intended
that two or three officers shall make expedi-
tions each year. Presumably the Chief
Examiner of Tickets and the Supervisor of
Carriage Cleaners will follow. But who
cafes? Cohen pays —that is to say, Cohen
supplies the necessary cash. The actual
meeter of the bill, plus interest, will be
posterity.

“Marloo” drops on a weak point:—
The rifle clubs of the Northern Rivers (N.SW.)
recently held a five-days’ meeting at Lismore. The
Defence Department supplied the bullets, of course,
and so soft was the “nickel” from which they, were
moulded that many of the rifles became blocked no
and useless. Good shooting was oat of the
question. During the five days not one' “possible”
was registered, and some bullets were seen - to actually
drop to earth half-way to the target. Fortunately the
targets were not firing back: had they been that sort
of target, supplied with the right sort of ammuni-
tion, what kind of chance would the Australian end
have had in the argument?

THE REALLY MODERN WAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I generally travel with about 70 gowns. One of
these is an adaptation of my own of the Japanese
kimono. I got the material from the Japanese royal
looms through the coaxing of an influential English
duchess, who took a fancy to me when I sang at her
town house.
Jewellery? Nothing but antiques put an extra
beat into my pulse. See this gold snake? It was
given by the old Queen to the Empress Eugenie.
How did I get it ? Oh, that’s too long a story, but
nearly every dealer in London has been trying to get
it. and offering enormous prices. It is one of the
oldest antiques known, and of wonderful workman-
ship. I have an antique necklace that was once
owned by the Pope. Again, I am not at liberty to
tell how I became possessed of it. — From an “inter-
view'’’ with a peripatetic mummer of the female sex.
I am a modern actress, and I practise modern ways.
{Sing, Iley! the dashing siren that I loolc l)
I understand the science of costuming for my plays.
{Sing, Iio! the pains in learning that I took!)
My wardrobe is immense,
And the cause of vast expense—•
Though I.draw a starry salary, you know!
{You know!)
I have kimonos galore—
Count my costumes by the score —
And my frocking is the Feature of the Show!
{Pirouette.)
We do but little acting —in the old, artistic sense.
{Sing, Iley! the joyous gowns and hats I wear!),
But our lingerie is lovely, and our footwear—oh!
intense.
{Sing, Ho ! the giddy Baldheads, all a-stare!)
A role superbly dressed
Brings joy that can’t be guessed
To the modern actress, wedded to her Art —
{Her Art!)
For in toilettes she may teach —-
Yea, it may be hers to reach,
And to captivate the (female) Public Hearts!
{Pas de seul.)
But, for surpassing dresses and the modes of Fashion’s
school.!
{Sing, Hey! for Redjern, Worth, Pacjuin, Lucille!),
The modern actress stands, or falls, upon her list of
“jools.”
{Sing, Iio! for antique treasures of cut-steel!)
Some twenty years ago
An actress was called “slow”
Whose gems were not dramatically thieved—
{Cruelly thieved!)
As she started by the train
For South Africa—or Spain—
Or anywhere the yarn would be believed!
{lligh-kick and wink.)
But Pm a Modern Mummer, and my method's differ-
ent,
{Sing, Iley! the regal circle I can boast!),
\s long as I can look a part the people are content.
{Sing, lio ! the kings who languish for me most!)
Instead of losing gems—•
And priceless diadems —-
And remaining inconsolable for years
(Oh. for years!)-;
I just hand my little list
To the Office Publicist,
Who takes care that the proper stuff appears!
(Blows a kiss.)
And many are my treasures—every one of them
antique—-
(Sing, Iley! the naughty stories they could tell!) —■
And they came to me so strangely—but of that I
mustn’t spsak.
(Sing, Iio! the press reporters serve me well!)
There’s my buckle from the Czar —-
And the Kaiser’s diamond star—
And my garters given by a Prince of Wales
(Prince of Wales !) ;
And that sweet, bejewelled fan
From the Crown Prince of Japan—
Please don’t ask, you naughty man! —just write
the tales !
(Dashes off.)

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The National Council of Australian Women, assem-
bled at Hobart, affirmed the necessity of a Bill to
protect men from shameless women who wear trans-
parent skirts.
Now, brothers, we can breathe again !
When danger first assailed us here
We felt in agonies of fear;
We stood alone to face the pain.
But women who are really good
Show their essential sisterhood ;
And knightly dames fare forth to hurt
The dragon of the flimsy skirt.
Nay, cower not! A weapon seize,
And stand erect! Help is at hand.
The matron stout, with lethal brand,
Will smite your smiling enemies.
It is indeed the better half
That saves us from the demon calf,
And garbs those girls who show their pins
In sackcloth to repent their shins.

“J. 0.8.”: Sydney strives to “keep up’’
Anniversary Day, but the glory of it
is dying fast. First, it is an un-
fortunate day for remembrance by any
people who own a fair amount of
national pride. Second, counter attractions
take people away from the water-edge, where
Governor Phillip threatened to spank any-
body who didn’t do as he was told. For
over half a century it really was the people’s
holiday. Crowds crushed around the open
spaces at the Quay to witness boat races
and sideshows, and for the time being forgot
that their ancestors had been flogged there
or thereabouts. Near where the Water
Police Court is now, men, women and chil-
dren gathered in great numbers and “cele-
brated,” often with a few tragedies by
nightfall. They carried their own liquor,
and some of it was furious stuff. The
authorities at last thought it would be a
good thing to have an officially-regulated
pub on the spot, so a shanty was run up;
and although it was not quite finished, P.M.
(afterwards Judge) Dowling and Inspector-
General McLerie licensed one Clark to
occupy the building. They were sorry
afterwards. As no man could pull corks
fast enough to satisfy the crowd, there was
a riot. Dowling went in to stop it, but the
pompous little man was shooed off, and
when Captain McLeerie strode in, that
gallant policeman was knocked down by a
hit on the nose with a bottle. Ah, these
are dull days!
A while back the Sydney police arrested
a young man for burglary, or bag-snatching,
or not knowing it was loaded, or something.
Having searched his residence for property
suspected of having got itself stolen, and
having shipped the little lot off to the
station, they set out to follow in the young
man’s footsteps among the pawnshops. When,
at the end of a long, toilsome week, they
examined a trolley-load of recovered mer-
chandise they didn’t find a locomotive or a
time-payment coffin in the lot, but they found
watches and chains, bangles, rings, brooches,
neck-chains, studs, sleeve links, scarf-pins,
cigar holders, wallets, sovereign-cases, match-
boxes. pendants, watch-keys, cigar-lighters,
shark’s teeth (gold-mounted), corkscrews,
knives, forks, spoons, hypodermic syringe,
case surgical instruments (old-fashioned),
revolver, gent.’s gloves, pocket-knife (white
handle), photo of German Emperor, Brown-
ing’s “Sonnets,” Dickens’s “Treasury,”
Grey’s “Elegy.” etc. The etcetera in them-
selves weighed a hundred-weight, but the
above will serve to show that Sydney pos-
sesses at least one very enterprising citizen.
And if there had been six more items in the
list some unpleasant people might have
suspected that the police hadrt’t disturbed
the assiduous collector as early as the cir-
cumstances called for.
“Red Tape”: Ma State’s Public Service
Board has gazetted a regulation which shows
the recklessness that may be expected when
a Labor Government is in office. Look at
it: —
The provisions of extended leave shall be ex-
tended to temporary officers subject to favorable
recommendations.
These are said provisions:—
40 years service.. 12 months leave on full pay.
20 years service. . 6 months leave on full pay.
15 years service. . 3 months leave on full pay.
The Board is now contemplating the possi-
bility of advancing full service privileges to
casual hands after 80 years temporary em-
ployment without a break.

1ST PUP: “Did Mother bring the meat?”
2ND : “No, the butcher was in the shop.”
At the opening of the latest Melbourne
City Court last week, Donald Mnckinnori
gave some interesting facts and figures re
the old courts and the new. The first two
were structures of wattle boughs and reeds,
but the third was a brick building which
served its purpose for years. Within half a
century the number of indictable charges
dealt with in the court had shown no annual
increase to speak of. The police cases were
296 in 1866, and only 316 last year. But
in the same period the civil cases had risen
from 4794 to 16,516. Mackinnon “took
this to be an indication of a law-loving
tendency among the people of Melbourne.”
Apparently the Melbourne of the roaring
’6o’s was less law-abiding and lawyer-ridden
than now. Or perhaps the explanation lies
in the present-day inefficiency of the police.
It is a simple matter of figures. The civil
plaintiff hauls himself and the defendant
into court and doesn’t need to wait till the
police get on his track and identify him—
and he increased bv nearly 12,000. In fact,
if plaintiff and defendant are both counted
he increased by nearly 24,000. But the
other kind of defendant only appears when
the police find him and drag him to the
fount of justice, and it may be because the
police are very poor finders and drasrgers
that the increase in his case was just 20.
There does not seem to be any real neces-
sity to regularly pollute the Pacific and the
surfing beaches with the house garbage of
Sydney. The routine of punting the rubbish
far out (20 miles from the Heads is now
the limit) is costly, and, once it goes over-
board, another mass of good manure is lost
to the earth, and the clean sea is foully
insulted. A Sydney alderman spoke last
week of the modern system of pulverising
garbage by special machinery located at
convenient points. The process is wonder-
fully clean. There is no fire, smoke, dust,
chimney-stack or noise, and, finally, so little
smell that an uninstructed Holmes would
have to Sherlock his hardest to discover the
plant. The pulverising results in the pro-
duction of a fertiliser worth on the average
about 2s. a ton —-and there is no public
parade of the banana skin that was and the
cat that ceased. To a Sydneyite used to
throwing things into the suffering sea, it
sounds like a heavenly dustbox dream in-
vented by an engineering angel; but it isn’t
anything of the kind —it is just a plain,
everyday fact in crowded London, where
they have to have ideas about such things
or die.
This world contains many troubles, in-
cluding beer and frauds and cold feet and
people who take themselves too seriously.
Of the latter are the leaders of the smaller
half of Ulster, though they always talk
as if'the whole of that province was at the
back of their bob-tailed insurrection. These
elderly bell-toppered gentlemen, many of
whom never saw a pea-shooter fired in anger
or smote a really infuriated enemy with a
sheep’s trotter, are pathetic. They claim to
have got together £1,000,000, which would
last for about a week of really strenuous
war, and they talk vaguely of an army of
100,000 amateurs who have been surrepti-
tiously learning the goose-step. The other
day Sir Edward Carson reviewed six alleged
battalions of the goose-steppers, and de-
clared that if his crowd is attacked “blood
will certainly flow” —how much blood or
whose he didn’t say. Now a real general,
bound for a real war, usually takes blood
for granted—also considerable piles of dead,
processions of wounded, burned houses,
ruined crops, shattered fortifications and
many other unpleasantnesses. He doesn’t
think it necessary to tell his troops that
neither he nor they will bolt before anybody
is at least injured. Another pleasing Sim
Tappertit of the Unionist party has put it
on record that the country is drifting to a
civil war that will “shatter the whole fabric
of national existence.” If there is any
truth in that prospective shatterment the
Jotyn Bull country must be amazingly frail
nowadays and liable to fall down if Por-
tugal blows on it hard.
The mantle of the late Henry Skinner,
Melbourne’s boss caterer, has passed to the
shoulders of the enterprising Greville, from
Westralia. There was an attempt to carry
on the old concern as “Skinner Limited,” but
in the meantime the man from W.A. had
got going in Melbourne, and now he has
taken over the catering plant of Skinner,
deceased, and bought out Skinner /iis. So
the statue erected to the honor and glory
of the late caterer by his exuberant South
Melbourne admirers is no longer a live busi-
ness advt. “Greville Limited,” of Perth and
Melbourne, trades in Skinner’s stead. The
new firm spreads the public banqueting
tables, and provides food and drink for pri-
vate gatherings at so much per head.
Firstly the V.R.C. contract, and then the
V.A.T.C. contract, were secured by Greville
Limited. Skinner of old was wont to say
that he made a loss, rather than a profit, on
the 3s. luncheon at Flemington racecourse,
where patronage is largely affected by the
weather, and considerably influenced by tile
behavior of the favorites for the first two
races on each day. Greville, however, after
a brief experience of Flemington catering,
and the bad luck of an inclement Melbourne
Cup week, is offering punters a rather better-
feed than’they used to get prior to the “rise
in the cost of living.” Apparently the loss
of Skinner is not going to be felt by those
ravenous Melbourne citizens who are for-
ever going to functions seeking what they
can devour. A year or two ago they were ter-
ribly afraid of a falling-off in refreshments.
But Providence, which tempers the wind to
the fat man, sent Greville Limited to their
aid.

“Pick” : The settlers on ex-Premier Wade’s
Bibbenl uke closer settlement resumption
area (N.S.W.) are whirling their milk-
buckets and declaring with unanimous fury
that something will have to be done. And,
sure enough, it looks like it. Owing to the
ruinous price per acre at which the Wade
Government resumed part of the Bibben-
luke sheep run from its Scottish absentee
owners, the settlers acquired their blocks at
a cost which, to the small man, meant finan-
cial.disaster except in the most favorable con-
ditions of seasons, markets and luck. But
the landless men took the risk, on the im-
plied understanding that the Cooma-Bom-
bala railway (then measured and in course
of construction) was to pass right through
the centre of the settlement. Incidentally,
the curvedness of the surveyed line, which
divided several of the blocks, gave the
holders much additional initial expense on
roundabout fencing. When the railway was
completed to its present terminus at Nimity-
be-lle, the navvies got tired, or Cohenstein
wouldn’t shell out, or some other cantanker-
ousness deferred its continuance for many
months. The last sledge-hammer that broke
the patient animal’s spine was when Works
Minister Griffith, on the ground of economy
(he practises it regularly), had a new sur-
vey made, that takes the line miles away
west of the settlement area. And now, on
peaceful nights, you could hear the an-
guished howls of deluded backbones for
miles. That is, you could if there were any
peaceful nights thereabouts.

Lord Rochdale, a Lancashire wool mag-
nate, now visiting these parts, was, as Geo.
Kemp, a member of that band of amateurs,
including the Steels, A. N. Hornby, Eccles
and others, who made Lancashire’s cricket
so popular in the mid-’Bo’s. Kemp (now
Rochdale) was a dashing batsman, but he
never quite dashed into a “test” game,
though he played for “The Gentlemen” and
the M.C.C. against Australian Xl’s. He
was a famous University batsman also, and
banged hard for Cambridge. Incidentally,
he served in S’Africa with the Imperial
Yeomanry, called, from their initials, the
“I’m Yours.” The noble lord is understood
to be here for the purpose of studying the
local wool plantations. His outstanding
features to-day are an unassuming manner
and a virulent hatband.

SCHUTT,

VICTORIAN
BAR.
Another of Maoriland’s brown fighting-
men has gone. Tuta Kihoniho, an old aris-
tocrat of the Ngatiporou. took up arms
against the Hauhaus in 1865. His father hav-
ing been killed, Tuta grabbed the old man’s
musket, and, at the age of 14, in company
with his mother, commenced to look for uto,
which is revenge. Afterwards he served
under Imperial officers and succeeded in
exterminating quite a number of his brown
brethren. Tuta was a great believer in com-
pulsory military training, and, years ago,
urged the Government to initiate that mea-
sure. Incidentally, he was the warrior who
almost succeeded in getting a troop of Maoris
accepted for service in S’Africa, and he was
a very angry old man when his proposals
were turned down on account of Henare’s
color.
‘Caber”: “H. 1.0.” (B. 15/1/’l4), in say-
ing that Tyson cut down his employees’
wages to. bedrock, does the dead old savage
an injustice. He paid good wages to some of
his hands on Felton, and treated them well.
They were the dozen or so who dummied se-
lections for him after the State had resumed
half the runs in the early ’7o’s. Jimmy
was particularly civil to them until the deeds
of the selections were in his hands. Then
he shooed them off the run. There were
three of his dummies who striack fast. Jimmy
kept on anteing up the yearly payments—
until it came to the last. This the dummies
paid, and got the deeds in their own names.
Tyson couldn’t invoke the aid of the law, as
it didn’t recognise dummying, and he was
about the most ropable man on the Downs
for six months after. One of the dummied
selections is within a couple of miles of
I'ittsworth, and £l5 an acre wouldn’t buy it.
The man who “jewed” Jimmy in that in-
stance fell among the thieves of finance and
died poor, but he didn’t die as friendless as
the man who paid for the selection.
SOME LITTLE ASSISTANCE.
“Why don't yon take your eye off that fast
creature in the box?”
“Well, you know, wealiy she ought to have
SOMETHING on her, doncherno... damn it
all weally. ”
The veteran Chief Justice Way, after an
Illness whicli- suggested that he might not
see the Bench again, got back to the full
radiance of his job for the S.A. Criminal
Sessions, and handed out some brisk sen-
tences, always accompanied by a short ser-
mon. For attempted suicide when in liquor
(“a dreadful crime against God and
Society”), six months; for bicycle-stealing
(“the calendar is full of these thefts, and
they will have to be put down”), 18 months;
for bigamy (“a grave offence against
Society, and a still more heinous one
against the second woman, who had been
done an irreparable injury”), three years.
The old judge’s great opportunity came with
a prisoner who complained of permanent,
headache, having had his skull cracked by
the police. His false beard and burgling out-
fit were shown up ; also the police read out
his record of crime since boyhood, and men-
tioned that his companion (who escaped)
had fired three shots at the bobby. “He
struggled so hard that it was the officer’s
duty to disable him so that he could not get
away. The blow on the head was richly
deserved. Prisoner had no cause for com-
plaint.” Four years; and, by way of ruh-
bimr it in, Constable Rowney. who did the
skull damage, was awarded £l5 for tackling
the pair single-handed; to which sum the
Government has added another £25.

started business for himself it was in these sheds.
Later on, he was on Brickfield Hill, and, later still,
in William-street, Woolloomooloo. His private resi-
dence was for a time on Botany-road, but in his swell
days he occupied Tara, a pretty-villa in Cleveland-
street, fronting the park. Dan was a city alderman
for some years, and in 1877 entered Parliament, and
sat until June. 1891, when he went under to the
Labor party. He was twice in and out of the Legis-
lative Council. Dan missed the chance of his life
when the Redmond brothers were here in the early
’Bo’s. Outside the Irish circle the visit was not
nopular; halls and theatres were refused, and as a
last resort the old Scandinavian Hall, which stood
on the site of the Tivoli Theatre, was obtained. Mr.
Bernard Gaffney giving a guarantee of £lOO to
cover Possible damage. Ructions were expected) but
everything was as calm as-a millpond. Dan was
asked to take the chair. He hesitated at first, and
then refused. He was Postmaster-General at the
time, and he “feared” —so J. G. O’Connor took the
chair, and Dan, behind the scenes, heard from the
tins of Julm Redmond such a scathing denunciation
of himself as he had never had to listen to before
Had Dan “cottoned” to the Redmonds he would'
have been found a seat in the Commons, with J. F.
Hogan, the two Currans, Dalton and others who had
helped “the cause.” The Svdnev Irish never forgave
him for that or for joining Parkes. Dan. though
never by any means rich, was fairly well off at
one time. No doubt he lost a bit bv speculation, but
the yarns he spun on that subject were like the
yarns he spun on many- others—well sketched. His
one chance lav in sticking to pork, the subject upon
which he really was well and solidly informed.
One of S. Australia’s two Grand Old
Smiths will be 90 next Tuesday. This is
Barr, brother-in-law and partner of the late
Thomas Elder. Barr Smith, close-up a mil-
lionaire, was probably the largest individual
contributor to the Adelaide Trades Hall
building fund. The other Smith, E. T.,
will be a youngster of 83 till next April.
Barr, who made his money mostly out of
wool, specialises in philanthropy; E. T., who
made his out of a brewery,' patronises ath-
letics of all kinds, and, like most S. Aus-
tralians, is good to his church —-one of the
“dissenting” brands.
Earl Fitzwilliam, who, the cable says, is
up to his neck in the Melville divorce case,
as one of the also-rans, is a big cheese in
Yorkshire, where he maintains a famous pack
of hounds. The} peer was' in Australia some
years ago, as leader of an elaborate treasure-
hunting expedition which had Cocos Island
for its objective. A steamer was chartered
and most elaborately stocked with all the
latest appliances; for finding hidden treasure,
from divining ;.-rods to youthful loveliness.
The party started to dig up the treasure,
and then came the news that the project had
been abandoned owing to a explo-
sion killing several of the-payty, and injuring
others. After that “explanation” all was,
and still is, silence. Perhaps some of the
Australians who accompanied the expedition
could tell us more. The belted-earl, is, as has
been said, rather busy, with other matters.
Simon Fraser, Melbourne’s boss Canadian,
is perhaps the only Australian crony of the
just-dead Strathcona. Fraser named his
mansion of Craigellachie, in the Balaclava
suburb, after the Canadian village where the
last spike of the Pacific Railroad was driven.
Strathcona’s wife was daughter of Hardisty,
a white squaw-man. The doctor told Strath-
cona he must work to live, so the old chap
grafted like a nigger—who mostly doesn’t.
With Mount Stephen—his cobber in the
great Canadian land-grab railway enterprises
—he gave £lO,OOO a year to the King Edward
Hospital. They built a Montreal Hospital
for £200,000, and further endowed it with
£160,000 for maintenance. Strathcona gave
£25,000 to Marischai College, Aberdeen, and
£BO,OOO to Magill University, Montreal; and
Strathcona’s Horse, raised for the Boer war,
cost him £200,000. He had a mania for man-
sions. His favorite was 1 in Dorchester-street,
Montreal, where there is a collection of pic-
tures almost rivalling Pierpont Morgan’s.
Other houses of his were in Grosvenor
Square, London, and Debden Hall, Essex ; he
rented the .Lytton seat of Knebworth: and
his little lot also included the two Argyll-
shire country boxes of Glencoe and Colonsay,
a fine house at Winnipeg, and another at
Piqton, Nova Scotia. The Canadian rail-
roads did not bring him in so much as has
been imagined; but his property in the Hud-
son’s Bay Company was colossal, and he
dabbled hugely in wool and banking.

Archdeacon Boyce, Sydney’s most strenu-

has just been awarded a 12 months’ holi-

McGowen is one of the pillars of his taber-

was superintendent of his Sunday-school.
“Übique” : .Jaggers was cursed with a goat, a goat
that possessed-the combined powers of Jack Johnson’s
punch and a steam hammer. When Jaggers found
his goat in the act of butting in the sides of his
humpy it annoyed him considerably. He put a
couple of sheets of iron up, but the goat playfully
butted them into chaos. Jaggers was struck with, a
rush of brains to the head. He placed one of “Smith’s
Ltd.” wheat-sacks against the orifice in the edifice.
The goat gleefully butted. Next second he found him-
self propelled against a tree. There is nothing so

“Rolf Boldrewood” Browne, now 87, lias
been seriously ill at liis home in South Yana
(Vic.). The old storyteller is a son of
Captain Sylvester Browne, who was, a mer-
chant in Macquarie-place (Sydney) in the
’3o’s. The youngster went squatting, but,
meeting with hard times, took a job as
police magistrate, and stuck to that till his
working days were over.
John Reale, well known along the N.S.W.
North Coast, has just made his Last Dive,
at the age of 56. He came from Ireland 35
years ago, was first a surveyor at Brisbane,
then went gold-mining on the Richmond
River, and later entered the Government
service as an expert in snagging rivers.
While he snagged he picked up a lot of in-
formation about explosives, which served
him well when afterwards he took to ex-
ploring the sea bed for a crust. Being sent
to blow up the steamer Friendship at the
Tweed River, he surprised his employers by
first recovering £5OO Worth of machinery.
On another occasion he put in good work
raising a laden punt, which had been sunk
at the entrance of the Richmond River. He
sealed the craft, and pumped air into it.
Six months ago he underwent an operation
for appendicitis, and six weeks later received
word to superintend operations at a wreck
at the Bellingen. When he reached Grafton
he felt a certain inward gloom or deteriora-
tion. A local doctor told him he had pleurisy,
but he did not even wait to have the pre-
scription made up. Once amongst his be-
loved diving tackle he was happy
until he got so ill that he had to
crawl into the Bellingen Hospital. He
spent three months there, and when he
left to look for more wrecks was still a fit
subject for the pneumonia that killed him
a few days later.
“Bookware” on a great family
It is arguable whether Strathcona, who was
Donald Smith before he was rich enough to buy a
title, is the greatest of the Smith clan. Adam, author
of the “Wealth of Nations,” ranks high. Sir Sidney
helped to block Napoleon at Acre. The brothers
James and Horace, stockbroker and solicitor, made a
great hit with their “Rejected Addresses” —supposed
to be poems written by the leading bards of the
day in response to an advt. for an address for the
.opening of Drury Lane Theatre. The Rev. Sydney,
the wit, was the best Edinburgh Review writer next
to Macaulay. Alexander was a poet of reputation in
his. day. And there was bookseller AV.H., who rose
to be Minister of War and Head of the Admiralty—•
the original of Sir Joseph Porter in “H.M.S. Pina-
fore.” And Goldwin and Albert and Robertson, and
—and Bruce and Dave. Or, at, least, there was
Dave until McGoorty annihilated him in half a round
Further, there was Augustus John Smith, who set up
in business as King of Lyonesse; and there was the
warrior who gave his name to the town of Harri-
smith in South Africa (his wife gave her name to
the town of Ladysmith) ; and Captain (Pocahontas)
Smith of Virginia; and the two Mormon Smiths
(Joseph and Hiram —Joseph was the only Smith who
met an angel) ; and Bob Smith, who called himself
Carrington, Governor of N.S.W. ; and the bandy-
legged Smith in “The Fair Maid of Perth” ; and
Tubal Cain, who was the first Smith ; and heaps of
other Smiths.
THE HANGMAN’S ACT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The latest aspirant to London vaudeville fame is a
Maorilander who declares that it is impossible to
hang him. He says that the governor of one of the
Maoriland gaols lent him the orthodox tackle and
he showed how easy it was to hang on a gallows
without injury.
Ah, work’s a most prosaic thing
That hurts and troubles me;
’Tis easier to gaily swing
Upon the gallows-tree!
’Tis easier to dance upon
The empty atmosphere
Than have to go to toil and don
A working donkey’s gear.
A rope around one’s throttle makes
A dainty sort of tie —
The fashion fad the dude forsakes,
And very few will buy!
But when Jack Ketch completes the knot,
And pulls the greasy door,
1 do not care a tinker’s jot,
I only shout “encore” !
For ev’ry swing but makes me sing
A song of sweet content,
And I can laugh at crimes that bring
The last dread punishment.
Yes, I shall never, never let
A felon’s dartr despair
Disturb me when I pirouette
Upon the glorious air 1

While one eye is running down the “Profits” column
the other might be put on to the job of noting that,
whereas the paid capital in 1906-7 was £1,000,000,
it is now £1,976,169. The div. for the past half-
year is, however, paid on only £1,750,000, from
which the capital was raised on December 31 by the
issue of 20,000 more shares. On the first of the
new issues seven years ago a premium was collected.
Then evidently the management saw that the 10
p.c. div. was an easy thing, wherefore subsequent
additions to capital have been made at par. In
other words, during the past five years the Commer-
cial of Sydney has found a good 10 p.c. investment
for another £750,000 of its shareholders’ money.
Present capital and visible reserves, after paying the
current div., amount to £3,632,730, plus £101,169
paid in advance of calls on the new issue. There
are 140,000 shares fully paid, and 20,000 half-paid:
average them at 150,000. Then the capital and
reserves per fully-paid share are equal to £24 4s.
That is to say, assuming that the capital is intact
and the reserves are worth 20s. in the £, there is a
visible value of £24 4s. per share, apart from any-
thing the business and contingency funds (or in-
ternal reserves) may be worth. Sales (ex-div.) at
the moment of writing are at £24 16s. If the
assets are right, the investor gets good security there
for his money. He pays practically nothing for
goodwill—which is a good deal less than he was
lately prepared to pay for the goodwill of concerns
whose success probably depended, upon one or two
mortal men who wera selling because they
found that they couldn’t stand work at that old
pressure which had produced the old profits.
As to whether capital is intact and reserves are
worth 20s. in the £, nobody can tell for certain
from the published accounts. There are, however,
one, or two indications. First, if the assets are over-
valued, the interest return should be small; and
in that respect this is how profits have actually
shown up as calculated on capital and reserves com-
bined :
June, ’O9. .£7 9 0 p.c. Dec., ’ll.. £7 19 10 p.c.
Dec., ’09.. 8 4 7 „ .June, ’12.. 8 2 11 „
June, MO.. 8 2 11 „ Dec., ’12.. 7 18 4 „
June, ’ll.. 719 8 „ June, ’13.. 7 18 4 „
Dec., ’lO.. 8 1 10 „ Dec., ’13.. 7 10 11 „
It is not much use taking notice of the last cut
served up on that table, because £200,000 or more
has only just been added to the capital, and it
earned nothing for most of the term and very little
for any part of it. Taking the average for the
past five years at about 8 p.c., it is fairly plain
that, assuming the profits have been fairly esti-
mated, there is no large amount of unprofitable
assets or unproductive accounts. True, there are
banks which show larger figures. But as against
that has to be set this bank’s remarkably large hold-
ing of' liquid assets. Take a comparison, which in-
cludes figures under that heading:—
Dec., 1912. Dec., 1913.
Notes .... £37,058 £25,514 Dee. £11,544
Bills.. .. 1,310.309 1,522,363 Inc. 212,054

Premises .. 538,943 555,593 Inc. 16,650
Liabilities of all kinds thus amount to £22,704,199.
Liquid assets therefore represent nearly 55 p.c. of
all the moneys owing by the bank —a proportion so
large that the Commercial of Sydney is clearly in a
position to offer more accommodation than it is
doing. Probably it reckons that the value of
most securities is too high, or that extravagance
is too rampant, or that industrial conditions are too
unsettled at the moment to encourage advances.

If the old A.J.S. had to be reconstructed again it
would probably be reconstructed differently. The
scheme looked all right, and in the end may be all
right; but reviewing it now it would probably have
been a great deal better if the share capital had been
made less. The scheme adopted involved, so far as
the old creditors were concerned—-(1) the writing-off
of 2s. 6d. in the £ ; (2) the issue of 4 p.c. inscribed
deposits as to 10s. in the £ ; (3) repayment of
2s. 6d. in the £ in cash within two years ; and (4)
the issue of paid shares as against the other ss. in
the £. There were further powers of converting
inscribed deposits into shares; and, finally, the old
shareholders, on paying up, got in new shares half
the amount, for which they were liable on the old
shares: the other half was written off. Thus in one
way and another the new bank has now £1,195,446
of share capital, besides £1,672,738 of inscribed
deposits, which are practically the same as 4 p.c.
preference capital; and the business isn’t big enough
to pay a respectable dividend on so large a capital
as that. Take the figures for a few banks: —
Advances

Capital. Advances. Capital.

Union .. .. 1,500,000 16,229,308 10.8
A.B.C 1,195,446 3,914,037 3.3
In such circumstances anything but a small dividend
is out of the question, so far as the A.B.C. is con-
cerned ; and the position is not improved, generally
speaking, by the existence of so large an amount of
inscribed deposits on which the bank must pay 4 p.c.
True, banks have been paying 4 p.c. for fixed de-
posits, and you can do more with inscribed stock
than with even fixed deposits, which are only fixed
for a short term; but the other aspect of the matter
is that the A. 8.0. can’t pay less than 4 p.c. on the
stock even when money is a much less valuable com-
modity than it has been lately. So it plods along
with a 3 p.c. div.; and though the assets may be as
good as gold, that low return means that the shares
are at a discount, and it isn’t good for the shares of
any bank to be at a discount. In a ease like this it
shouldn’t matter, but it does: the depositor doesn’t
like it, and the borrower, who thinks he will be less
likely to be squeezed at an awkward time by a
prosperous concern, is apt to judge of a concern’s
prosperity by the size of the dividend and the price
of shares.
Yet, looking at the thing as it should be looked at,
the depositor couldn’t see any better security than
he has here. Consider these figures:—
Dec., 1912. Dee., 1913.
Paid capital .. £1,195,275 £1,195,447 Inc. £172
Inscribed deposits 1,711,448 1,672,738 Dec. 38,710
All other debts. . 2,691,287 3,099,067 Inc. 407,780
Liquid assets . . 1,328,416 1,735,315 Inc. 406 899
Advances, etc. .. 3,915,748 3,914,038 Dec. 1710
Premises, etc. . . 375,392 360,706 Dec. 14,686
Add to the capital and inscribed deposits the re-
serves after paying the dividend, and you get a
total of £2,908,060, while all the debts to the
public amount to only £3,099,067. The latter,
being a first charge on all the assets, are thus more
heavily guaranteed than the deposits of any other
bank in Australasia—and that is saying a good deal.
Put in another way, liquid assets could pay all but
£1,363,752 of the money owing to the depositors
and other pref. creditors, and there is £4,274,743 of
severely assets wherewith to pay that
£1,363,752. So much for the security of the de-
positors. As for borrowers, the position is that the
bank has 56 p.c. of all its liabilities (other than on
inscribed deposits) in liquid shapes; and a bank
with that much money, and with increasing deposits,
may reasonably be expected to be looking for more
loans and not for chances to call in existing ad-
vances. Having been so long under a cloud, this
bank is handicapped; but its means are so ample
that it ought to command more business the better
its position is known. Reference has been made to
the fact that the inscribed deposits are practically
4 p.c. pref. capital. The qualification is necessary
because (1) the bank has the right to repay this
money, and (2) it is incumbent on it to put aside
£15,000 each half-year towards repayment. The
management may do this out of profits if it wants
to , but it is equally at liberty to do it out of corpus
—that is, the general body of assets.

This isn’t of much interest now to the old share-
holders in the Land Mortgage Bank, inasmuch as
the Freehold Assets Co. bought a controlling in-
terest last year and runs and practically owns the
whole outfit. The price paid was 12s. per share.
They once were £5 shares, paid to £l. Then the
dreadful boom collapsed, and two calls of £1 and
one of 10s. were made, and the shares were written
down to the extent of £2 10s. Subsequently 12s.
per share was returned, and the shares were written
down to £1 18s., of which £1 10s. was thus
unpaid. Late last year a call of 2s. 6d. was made,
so the shares are now paid to 10s. 6d., and have a
liability of £1 7s. 6d. The money raised by the
last call has apparently been put "into debentures
and debenture stock (unspecified). The freehold
assets have all been got rid of, except for a trifle of
£420, and the Freehold Assets undertaker is now
chiefly occupied collecting the instalments of pur-
chase money. The next table cuts up the assets
into sections:—

Net assets ..£100,143 £118,911
There are 145,770 shares, so if the assets are worth
20s. in the £, there is about 16s. per share after
providing for the current dividend. But you can’t
tell from merely looking at the figures whether the
assets are worth 20s. in the £, though the balances
on propertv sold ought to be pret.y right, and'there
isn’t anything visibly wrong with the other items.

the shareholders back it up. In these circum-
stances, the depositor who loses any sleep wondering
whether his money is all right had better take it
out, and bury it in a deep hole, and chain a shoal
of tigers on top, and plant man-traps all round.
Further, the bank has £127,547 cash and liquid;
and if that doesn’t further comfort the depositor he
had better dig the hole 14ft. deeper and lay poison
in the neighborhood. Naturally, under the condi-

The Bulletin doesn’t suppose that even this co.
made a profit of £54,765 in the past six months.
Xhe fact, no doubt, is that the co. had internal
reserves, which it capitalised when it recently issued
bonus, shares to the extent of one new for every three
old ones. The profits for the past half-year were,
therefore, £54,765 less whatever amount was drawn
from these internal reserves. The present paid capi-
tal is £211,212 in 281,616 £1 shares paid to 15s.
The nominal capital, increased at a meeting held
during the past half-year, is £500,000, in £1
shares ; so there are still 218,384 shares to be issued
and ss. to be called up on those shares that are
issued. By comparison, Sydney Ferries, Ltd., is a
poor, drab thing alongside this, in spite of all the
curses that are heaved at it as a heavy-fisted mono-
poly. Put the record for the past 10 years this
way:—
Manly (Pt. Sydney
Jackson). Ferries.
Capital, 31/12/’O3 .. .. £25,000. £140,000
Capital since paid in money. . 4,335 135,000
Capital paid out of profits . . 181,877 50,000
Present capital ..£211,212 £325,000
In other words, for every £lOO of shares (par
value) which they held in 1903 the Manly and Port
Jackson people now hold £825, without having paid
out one penny to get them; while for every £lOO
the Sydney* Ferries’ shareholder now has £135,
apart from what he has paid cash for since the
original purchase. And while Sydney Ferries has
been paying 10 p.c. in dividends, the Manly gold-
mine has been mostly handing out 13J p.c. Cer-
tainly the S_ydney Ferries did a bit of watering
(£60,000) in 1899, and it proposes to do some
more now; but throwing that in, this is how it
would work Out:—
Manly Syd. Ferries
' (10years). (15years).
Original capital .. ... £25,000 £60‘,000
Additions in money . . . . 4,335 180,000
Additions out of profits . . 181,877 226,666
Total capital ..£211,212 £466,666
So far as Sydney Ferries is concerned, that is how
things will stand after the insults to be offered
shareholders (a share bonus of 33& p.c.) at the
forthcoming meeting have been pocketed. The re-
sults will still be far short of those of the remark-
able concern which, besides taking the tripper down
the Harbor, nowadays has a large and very service-
able traffic in Manly residents.
While: the- co. has been paying out its thumping
dividends in cash, it has been spending tens of thou-
sands in new vessels. The Bulletin doesn’t know
what the average outlay has been, but estimates it
at an average of £16,000 a. year for the past eight
years. It has probably been more. Another £3OOO
as an average has gone into property and plant after
allowing for depreciation. The co.’s fleet of eight
steamers is now fairly ample for the traffic; and,
though additions will have to be made, it is certain
that they won’t have to be made at the rate main-
tained during the past few years. That is to say,
some of the money which has hitherto been avail-
able for distribution in shares will, all going well,
be in future available for distribution in cash. At
present, notwithstanding recent large payments, there
is approximately £46,000 in hard money and as
vood as money in excess of liabilities. As for risks,
there seems now to be only one of much consequence.
A harbor disaster, due to anything in the' shape of
negligence on the part of the co. or any of its ser-
vants, might easily run away with £250,000 in
claims, and; for a long while afterwards there would
be a much larger disposition to trust a tram to
Googee than a ferry to Manly.

This co. hasn’t yet been put under an Act like the
one passed a year or so back in N. S Wales; but
a Bill was prepared lately, and something
is pretty certain to be done before long.
In ,N V - 5... Wales—following the fair-enough pre-
cedent of —the cos. ' were permitted to
revalue their assets, capitalise their reserves thus
created or already existing, and pay 10 p.c. on the
lot; . but, so far as new capital is concerned, they
are limited to 7 p.c.—unless, in both cases, they can
reduce the price of gas, and even then the climb up
the dividend pole will be slow and arduous. It
seems a fair thing to assume that, when its time
comes, the Melbourne co. will be allowed the same
right of revaluation and capitalisation; and, in that
case, it will have a nice little lot of cards to shake
down its sleeve, since for many years past it has
been paying for practically all additions out of
revenue. Ten years ago the total expenditure charged
to capital account was £2,150,073 ; now the total
is £2,347,215, and about half of the extra £197.142
has been added during the last 12 months. What
the additions, and extensions have cost during 10
years The Bulletin doesn’t know to a pound,
but it puts them at £575,000, of which £378,000
has been provided out of profits and £197,000 out
of capital. No doubt something considerable had
been paid for out of profits before then; also, while
the wasting assets (plant, etc.) have been written
down, the property assets, which have increased
largely in value, haven’t been written up. The
present share capital is £857,210, in 171,442 shares
of £5; and another £466,525 has been paid in
premiums. A revaluation of assets would, it seems,
easily give holders share for share, which would
mean transferring the premiums to capital and
adding £390,675 spent on works, etc., out of revenue.
Whether the co. could pay 10 p.c.—the N. S. Wales
rate—on double the present capital is another matter.
After writing-down stocks, etc., and making other
charges for depreciation, the past 12 months’ profit
was £195,154, which is equal to over 11 p.c.
on double the present capital. That would leave a
fair margin over 10 p.c. ; but three things have to
be remembered —(1) owing to the present trade
boom recent profits have been abnormal; (2) it is
uncertain whether some part of the amount spent on
additions is not a set-off against wear and tear of
old works, in which case, of course, the true net
profit for the past year was less than £195,154; and
(3) Parliament would certainly fix the standard
price of gas below the present 4s. 41d. As to the
second point, it is highly probable that not much of
a deduction ought to be made, because “repairs,
maintenance and renewals” are charged up with
ordinary working exes. Apart from stores, £55,000
was spent under this heading in the past six months.
So it looks as if the co. could, out of its present
revenue, pay a fairly comfortable 10 p.c. on twice
its present capital if it merely provided for current
depreciation and didn’t stuff profits into new works,
and if it were allowed to charge the present 4s. 44d.,
which it wouldn’t be.
As mentioned above, the co. has been very busy
lately. Twelve months ago the capital expenditure
had been all met out of share and debenture capital
except as to £82,424. The debit now is £166,470.
This money has evidently been got by temporary
loans: “Sundry tradesmen and others for amounts
due” were creditors for £135,195 at the end of
1912, while the total now is £230,131. With a
view, no doubt, to cleaning the slate, the directors
propose to issue another 10,000 shares (terms not
mentioned), and also to sell up to £50,000 of deben-
tures. (The debentures outstanding are usually for
an amount equal to the share capital.)
So long as the law remains as it is, the co. can
pay a 10 p.c. div. when it charges 7s. per 1000 for
gas and another £ p.c. for every ljd. reduction. The
present price is 4s. 44d.—enough to give the co. the
right to go 6>l p.c. above the standard 10 pc. That
is, the. co. is now entitled to pay (say) 8 p.c. on
twice its present capital. Notwithstanding that the
N.S.W. law allows a 10 p.c. div. on the capital as
written up, it is arguable Whether the Melbourne co.
should be entitled under any new law to pay any
larger dividend than it is entitled to pay under the
existing law —a fact which may have some bearing on
the price which the investor can afford to pay for
shares. Under tlie present law the co. can’t pay
20 p.c on its present capital, or 10 p.c. on capital
watered up to twice its present size, unless it reduces
the price to 2s. lOd. “Sell gas at 2s. 10d.,” Parlia-
ment may say, “and we will arrange things so that
you can issue share for share, and pay 10 p.c. on the
lot straight away.” Parliament may safely be relied
Upon, when it tackles the question, to fix the standard
below 4s. 44d., anyhow. , And if it does so, the
present profits will, for a time at least, be cut into.

The people in this prosperous old concern can put a
heavy weight behind the strings that pull business
to the wharf, which is the principal source of revenue.
Adelaide certainly owns an outer harbor now; but
the inter-State and coastal trade, which has grown
rapidly, continues to stick to Port Adelaide —and that
probably is where the previously-mentioned pull tells.
Still, the co. hasn’t relied only on that, but has
spent money freely in keeping its property up to
date. This has of late made a pretty deep cut into
the accumulated funds, though after providing for all
liabilities (except the current dividend) there was
£3968 left in cash, etc., at the end of the half-
year. As the table shows, profits have been unusually
large during the past few years, and the dividends
have moved up even faster than the profits. It is
quite possible that, when the end comes to the trade
boom (which is largely the result of furious borrow-
ing that cannot go on indefinitely), profits will ease
off; and in that case dividends"may ease, too, for
the present margin of profits in excess of dividends
isn’t a very wide one. Nevertheless when you look
at the old 7 p.c. div., which was paid for many
years, it is as well to remember that in those days
the co. had a mortgage, and it might usually have
paid more dividend if it hadn’t been wise enough to
use a good lump of the profits to pay off the debt
and thus get rid of the interest bill.

While the present construction boom lasts this co. is
in clover. It is in the middle of two big contracts —■
one with the -S._. Aus. Government for £30,000;
another with the N.S.W. Government for £39,305
worth of pipes for the Umberumberka scheme —the
utterly uncalled-for work on which the State is
spending nearly £400,000 of Cohen’s money for the
supply of Broken Hill, in spite of the fact that the
private co.’s waterworks pass over to the State
without payment in five or six years. When the
borrowing boom breaks it will be a long time
between titbits like this; and present profits are
therefore probably no guide to normal profits. Never-
theless. if the pipes come up to their promise, there
should be always some work to do. Elsewhere they
have answered ; whether they will do as well in the
dry par.ts of Australia, where there isn’t always the
water to keep them full, only time can tell for cer-
tain. Meantime the Co. hasn’t to spend millions on
plant. Though it has factories in Sydney, Melbourne
and Adelaide, property and plant run to only £24.611
—and saleable property represents most of that.


AFTER ALCOHOLIC EXCESS.
Many who suffer from the effect of alcoholic
excess have found O.T. a boon through its effect of
satisfying the craving for alcoholic stimulant. Others
find O.T. an invaluable morning “pick-me-up.” O.T.

A great mistake, when erecting new works or re-
arranging old ones, is often made in constructing the
building and installing machinery ere looking round
for means of transport of the raw material, half-
manufactured and finished goods. Messrs. Adolf
Bleichert and Co., of London, have issued various
catalogues and leaflets, illustrating and describing a
few of the many transport systems and plants which
they have supplied, and which show the solution of
the transport question and the advantages of em-
ploying such appliances. W. and J. Lempriere,
Melbourne and Sydney, are the Australian representa-
tives, and would be pleased to hear from those in-
terested. A specially trained engineer is retained to
consult and advise.*

From June to September the Bacchus Marsh Shire
Council (Vic.) crushed and spread 3000 cub. yards
of road metal, at an average cost of 2s. 6d. per cub.
yard, and the cost of the spalls per cub. yard aver-
aged 2s. 4d., making a total cost of 4s. lOd. per cub.
yard, broken and spread. Their last contract under
the handbreaking system amounted to 6s. 3d. per
cub. yard stacked on the roadside, and spreading Is. ;
total, 7s. 3d., as against 4s. lOd. — a saving of 2s. sd.
per cub. yard. This result was obtained by using a
Bigelow 16in. x 9in. Patent Stonecrusher, and the
Austral Otis Eng. Co., Ltd., of Melbourne, are the
manufacturers of these breakers.* [2

Extract from The Insurance Record, London, Sep-
tember 22, 1911: “To have written insurances for
£5,550,000 (Ordinary, Industrial and Accident) in
a year which was marked by the keenest competition
from beginning to epd is an achievement which
proves that the Colonial Mutual is a force to be
reckoned with in every sphere to which its influence
extends.”*

The Goulburn Municipal Council, after exhaustive
inquiries, have decided to install two 128 B.H.P.
“Hornsby” Suction Gas Engines and Plants, as the
motive power for their electric supply (in competi-
tion With all classes of engines and boilers), thus
following the example set by a number of towns in
Australasia and other parts of the world, which have
already installed the “Hornsby,” with highly favor-
able results. Intending purchasers of, motive power
should apply to R. HORNSBY & SONS, LTD., Sid-
ney, Melbourne and Brisbane.*

Water-Supply engineers will be interested to learn
that further evidence proving the durability of W. I.
and Steel Pipes when coated by the Asphaltum pro-
cess, has just been obtained by the engineers of the
Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works. Certain
alterations were made to the main which supplies the
City of South Melbourne with water, and consequently
some pipes were taken up. These pipes were made in the
year 1889, and were coated with Asphaltum composi-
tion in the usual way, and they were laid in ground
that was particularly unfavorable to the preservation
of any unprotected metal, being originally swampy
land, containing much vegetable matter, and filled
with tidal dredgings. On examination, these 24-year-
old pipes were found to be in an excellent state of
preservation, and the Board’s engineers were so satis-
fied with their condition that they decided to use
them again. They were, therefore, removed to the
works of Messrs. Mephan Ferguson Proprietary Lim-
ited, at Footscray, Victoria, where these 24-year-old
pipes were cleaned, retested, and recoated with
Asphaltum composition in a new and improved pro-
cess. They are now being relaid in a position where
they will have to withstand a working pressure of
1351 b. to the square inch. That the Asphaltum pro-
cess for coating pipes is rust-proof and thoroughly
efficacious is proved by the foregoing.*

This, of course, has its disadvantages. Anybody can
make wooden pipes—that part of the business isn t
patentable—wherefore when this co. makes a market
it is quite possible that other men who want to
make a job for themselves will set up little factories.
The same thing happened with fibrous-plaster ceil-
ings, etc., it will be remembered. This, anyway, is
liable to have a steadying influence on profits. For
the present, the co. has unusual liabilities, amounting
to £32,751 ; but sundry debtors owe £28,042 and
stocks on hand —mostly in connection with the big
contracts, no doubt —run to £44,484, so the financial
position is easy.

Hitherto The Bulletin had to complain (1) that
the co. owed over-much in proportion to its own
capital and reserves, and (2) that it was too short
of till money. Owing to the recent increases of
capital at a premium there is less reason for com-
plaint now under heading No. 1; and the position
is also somewhat improved as to No. 2, although
£16,113 is still mighty little wherewith to face
depositors to whom you owe £342,678. No doubt
all the deposits are of the fixed variety; still there
are times of stress when it is advisable to be able
to promptly pay off even a depositor whose money
isn’t legally due to him for a few months. A worse
defect now lies in the wretchedly small lay-by, follow-
ing on the further increase of the dividend. In an
advance business of this sort there must be consider-
able risks, and £944 is much too small a contribu-
tion to meet a year’s contingencies. Certainly there
may be an inner reserve of some sort; but if there
is, it is very well hidden.

Further details are available of the con-
version of Robert Harper and Co. (Melbourne) into
a public co. Of the authorised capital of £500,000
a total of £366,470 is now issued: —

Present owners of the business take the ordinaries ;
and pref. shares carry no voting powers except in
regard to the issue of debentures, etc. Four Harpers
constitute the Board of Directors. Flack and Flack
are the auditors; and the prospectus (issued after
Goodall had placed the shares) states that for 9-J-
-years prior to March 31, 1912, the average annual
profits were £32,874, and -much more than that
for recent years. As the pref. issue will call for
only £B4OO a year, another almost gilt-edged invest-
ment has been created.
“R. 8.”: It seems a certainty that the
Melbourne Tramway Co., with its prehistoric cars
and snailish rate of transport, will be given a 10
years’ extension after 1915 on some such basis as
the halving of profits by the municipalities and the
co. _ It should, if anything, be 75 p.c. to the munici-
palities and 25 p.c. to the co. ; • but the co. has a
lot of friends in municipal councils, though the
general public would like to hang, draw and quarter
it. But why give the co. any extension? The
municipalities take automatic possession of the per-
manent way; so why shouldn’t they buy the rolling
stock and start off the mark next year? The whis-
pered extension for 10 years means plain graft, and
the fool-public ought to get to grips with it immedi-
ately. The system itself is bad, but Melbourne will
have to put up with it till it gets another. Any-
how, the day of the streef vehicle confined to rigid
lines is gone, and the cable system, being the worst
of all, is more than gone. The motor-’bus business
in Melbourne must grow, and the trams’ proposed
extra four miles an hour, involving the cutting out
of mid-block stops, won’t help to keep the traffic from
the mobile transport that comes to the kerbing when
you nod.
* * * *
Partly because of the strike in the South
Coast (N.S.AV.) coal-mines, and partly because last
year’s boom in metals sent every smelter going full-
tilt, Mount Morgan ran so short of coke that it had
to_ buy some shipments of foreign stuff; and the
price was so high as to make the management feel
very unwell. To prevent a repetition of the dose,
the co. has lately been financing the Illawarra Coke
Co., and in return has got first call on the entire
output of a nest of new ovens for the next five years.
* * * *
Cope’s Creek Central, a Tingha (N.S.W.)
mouthful for the remnant of what used to be “the
Queen-street crowd” in Melbourne, would have been
in a bad way now but for the Skeleton Creek addi-
tion to its ground. What is left at Cope’s Creek is
hard tack and not rich enough to stand a working
cost mueh in excess of the present 9/d. per yard.
If the tin market drops a few pounds further, the
Cope’s plant will have to be shifted over to the other
property. Profit for the half-year was £3395, of
which the 30t,h div. (Is.) took £1500; and there was
about £2400 of liquid assets in excess of debts on
November 30. Prospects at Skeleton Creek are still
good.
* * * *
Between October 18 and January 17 the
tin output of Vegetable Creek (N.S.W.) has in-
creased from 45cwt. to 150 cwt. (7) tons) per week.
The washdirt has decreased in quality from 801 b. to
401 b. per cubic yard ; but it increased from 18in. to
72in. in thickness. This is from the Rock shaft.
From Allen’s shaft they are blocking out on 2ft.
of washdirt worth 1201 b. per cubic yard. In the
east crosscut there is 6ft. of wash worth 2501 b. per
< ard; but just here the bottom dips rapidly, so it
is an exceptional prospect. A total of 15 tons of
black tin was produced in a fortnight, worth approxi-
mately £l7OO. But 20 p.c. of that ( £340) goes to
the ground landlord, for this struggling concern is
really in the position of a tribute party. Under
such conditions dividends drop in very slowly on
130,000 shares. In fact, they drop so slowly that
most shareholders don’t remember the last shower.

Edna May (W.A.) has its new grinding
pans in position and has thus automatically increased
the crushing capacity of the mill. Coarser battery
screens are being fitted, and a further increase in
stamp duty is promised early in February. Supple-
mentary plant to deal with accumulated sands and
slimes will also soon be in operation, and these vari-
ous additions are expected to increase the profit-earn-
ing capacity by 25 p.c. Word is also being passed
round that the higher-grade ore in the bottom will be
sent to the mill at an early date, thus inflating re-
turns and profits still further. Of course there is
the possibility of the south-west drive in the present
bottom level meeting with disaster and upsetting the
market; but this, together with the risk of the reef
going down to another level, is made light of by local
•
optimists. If, say the admirers of the stock, the
reef holds down and maintains its present value to
the next level, then the profit in sight will not fall
far short of £200,000.

* * * *
Hannans Reward (W.A.) wound up
another year with a loss of £39 on the 12 months’
operations. An output of 27,169 tons, mostly rooted
out by tribute parties, was treated for a return of
10s. 3d. per ton. The most important work done
by the co. during the year was the unwatering and
opening-up of the 400 ft. level of the Mount Charlotte
lease, where a series of short cross leaders of fair-to-
middling value were exposed. Since the show was
first pegged 21 years ago, close on £300,000 has
been dug out of it and passed through the mill,
while another £lOO,OOO or thereabouts must have
been dryblown from its surface. Excepting a small
sum absorbed in the payment of one dividend, every
penny taken out has gone back into the mine. The
lease has just been renewed by the Labor Govern-
ment without any penalty, but the chances of share-
holders getting any more in the next than they did
in the last 21 years are very poor.
Yuanmi (W.A.) is’forced to chip a bit
more off its monthly profits. Some months ago the
general managers advised the London Board that the
outlook at the Black Range section of the property
was getting darker, owing to failure of development
to maintain the reserves. A later communication
recommends that for the next six months the output
be reduced so as to show £3500 profit per month.
* * * •#
Ida H. (W.A.) announces that the revenue
from its Laverton show for the financial year ended
June last was £36,278. A supplementary report
states that the approximate profits for the first five
months of the current year amounted to £4077, plus
£2608 mopped up in capital expenditure. This
performance is considered so satisfactory by the
Board that it has declared a 3d. div. In their report
the directors state that the deepening of the shaft to
further test the high values met in sinking the winze
below 1200 ft. is being pushed ahead, and that the
new plant for the treatment of concentrates is work-
ing tip-top.
Sons of Gwalia has started to prospect
northward in new ground at the No. 1 level. Hitherto
the general belief has been that there was nothing
worth bothering about in that direction, but someone
has induced the'eo. to try to explode this theory.
Things look pretty well in the south end of the
bottom level, where 900 ft. of payable ore has already
been driven on, and the prospect of more being
opened up is good.
Last year Oroya Links (W.A.) re-
equipped Croesus Prop, shaft out of revenue, and
showed a net profit of £1759. The co. is now in a
position to pay a 3d. div., and with capital expendi-
ture practically finished, and with an expected increase
in_ monthly profits to £3OOO, it should be able by
this time next year to distribute double that amount.
The intersection of 275. ore at 932 ft. in Croesus
Prop, shaft has improved the outlook, but with mostly
worn-out mines to handle the co. will never be able
to look very far ahead.
East Langi Logan, Ararat (Vic.), is under
the venerable wing of Wm. Noall and Son, whose
last float was the Huddart Parker rush of two years
ago. As the memory of the Stock Exchange doesn’t
ro back to the time when the Noalls previously did a
mining float, East Langi terms were watched. Speak-
ing frankly, there is a bit of the Huddart-Parker
atmosphere still around. Out of an issue of 75,000
shares, 15,000 of £1 and £2500 cash go to the
vendors. The cash was big enough to bear the refund
of £6OO to the Mines Department for boring; but
that sum is to be a charge on the proceeds of the
first gold won—which may arrive years hence. The
co. and not the vendors fork out the “usual flotation
exes.” Away from the financial side, the float is of
interest, because it backs bores put down by Stanley
Hunter to confirm his theory that the real Langi
gutter is east of the New Langi rather than that the
latter claim covers the lead. He got wash and gold
prospects 702 ft. above the sea level. The New
Langi’s deepest bore was 697 ft., so it isn’t altogether
clear that Hunter is right. It will take many moons
and much cash to settle the dispute.
Garden Gully holds Bendigo’s record for
divs., but it is down now to a half-year’s output of
6790 z. from 2053 loads. This did not cover outgo,
so calls had to be got in to cut the overdraft down
to £l7OO. The deep ground in No. 3 shaft has a
cap 14ft. wide. It is poor stuff, but ought to be
prospected. Patchy stone exists at 1550 ft. in the
main shaft, with just enough gold to tantalise a
tribute party. The best chance for the co. seems to
be on the slide, on which spurs are furnishing payable
stone, in the Carlisle next door. There isn’t much to-
day in the Garden Gully; still worse chances exist
at Bendigo.
* * * »
Unless things improve a lot, W. J. Nichol
isn’t going to sink below 2480 ft. at the Lord Nelson,
St. Arnaud (Vic.). This means the end of deep
mining in another Victorian village. Nichol softens
his news by a tender allusion to the past history of
the mine, and the remark that history may repeat
itself at depth. Already 800 ft. of sinking has been
hung on the same thread of hope. The 2480 ft. level
is in material that doesn’t show a profit, and the
best thing is to clean up the stopes unless something
unexpected turns up at 2480 ft. The ore yields now
only about 3}dwt. gold per ton, and the sands and
slimes another 4dwt. The gold is of low value, the
mine is hot, the supply of miners intermittent, and
the costs bill increases every half-year. So it will
take “a solid improvement” at 2480 ft. to cause Nichol
to resume sinking.
* * * *
New Moon, Bendigo, is so far behind a
cloud that there is talk of calls. Capital paid up,
£11,560; dividends to date, £369,328 —on that
record the mine has earned a little from shareholders’
pockets. The half-year has been spent chiefly in
probing the eastern ground (the deep ground has been
given up as a bad job for the present), and spurry
country holds out hopes. But the co.’s stone has
got down to 3dwt., and with hardly any profit in
the public crushing, and with a good deal of money
going out for prospecting, the overdraft on current
account ( £ 1959) was getting pretty close up to
the reserve fund fixed deposit ( £2450) on December
31. There is 6s. 6d. a share to call on the 24,000
shares.
* * * *
Porepunkah, one of the consistent div-
payers among the Bright (Vie.) dredgers, had an
income of £2293 in the past six months. Exes, ate
up £l6OO, leaving £693 for profit, so the three shilling
divs. ( £750) were not fully earned, even apart from
any question of depreciation. Term by term the
directors have been good enough to say what area
had been chewed up during the six months —usually
about 10 acres. But they have never told a more
important thing—what area remained to chew up.
Neither, until now, have they written down the
book value of the partly-consumed mining property.
As, however, the end is getting nearer, they have
now written the property down from £5397 to
£2698. Plant still stands at £3308, and liquid
assets in excess of liabilities are only £3lO. Capi-
tal is £5OOO. It is about time the co. started to
get busy and provide a fund for return of capital.
If this isn’t done, shareholders must remember that
the alleged dividends are being paid out of their
principal.
* * * *
Another one gone—Tommy Burns Tin Co.
(N.Q ) is reconstructing. Capital is finished and
money is required for development work. The mine
yielded £60,000 worth of tin and paid £ll,OOO in
divs. In spite of the awful example of Gilmore,
Molloy and Garnet, the directors wouldn’t see the
absolute necessity of building up a reserve fund to
tide over the poor time that comes to every mine.
For the protection of shareholders, legislation making
a reserve fund compulsory is badly needed. The
present feckless system is doing a lot to wreck
mining.
Lass o’ Gowrie, the N.Q. tin-show owned
mostly by a few Adelaide people, is having one of
its gay times. A lot of 110 tons of ore has just
been crushed for 51J tons of concentrates, worth
(say) £3000; and 45 tons of 35 p.c. ore now await
the packers. It won’t take much of this sugary
stuff to give the syndicate its money back.
Gympie (Q.) is still on bread and drip-
ping. Some oi the most important mines barely
average 20s. per ton. Last year the Scottish Gympie
crushed 84,688 tons for 20,8030 z., averaging 4.9dwt.
Still it gave its shareholders £8250. Dividends on
660,000 shares are now paid half-yearly instead of
quarterly. No. 2 S. Great Eastern crushed 5900 tons
for 16570 z. ; average s.7dwt. Its Inglewood reef
at the 2000 ft. level is 9ft. wide, and becoming more
mineralised. Pavable leaders at the 1230 ft. level
are helping this old mine. McLeod’s New Wilmot
crushed 1892 tons for 11750 z., the bulk of it being
obtained in December. A black slate floor met with
at the 746 ft. level enriched No. 3 reef. It is too
early to say whether there is a chance of this pay-
able streak extending into the Monkland and Ingie-
wood. S. Glanmire and Monkland had a poor year,
crushing 2856 tons for 10740 z. It is searching the
conglomerate formation for patches of black slate
in which the quartz leaders become more fruitful.

The decayed Croydon goldfield (Q.) has
been invaded by a party of experienced tin miners
from Ilerberton, who have taken up a lease known
as the Croydon Hope, 10 miles from the township ;
and a telegram says that an average of 11.31 p.c.
has been obtained from 103 tons crushed at the
Richmond battery.
A week-end spurt in Mount Elliotts (Q.)
seems to disregard the small ore reserves, and to
be based wholly on an idea that an amalgamation may
mature with Mount Oxide. Broad hints were thrown
out at the London meeting, but no mine was actually
mentioned.
* * ■» *
Mammoth (N.Q.) shares have had a
shaking up on the Sydney market. Just before this
year was hatched the crosscut at the 230 ft. level
(No. 3) was in 50ft., and had still, according to
estimate, some 20ft. to go to reach the main lode.
The winze below No. 2 level (160 ft.) was down 53ft.
in 12 p.c. ore on the hanging wall and 4 p.c. on the
footwall. The lode that was passed through while
crosscutting was 12ft. wide, worth 5 p.c. copper, 3oz.
silver, and ldwt. gold. The latest news simply men-
tions a good development, but this may refer to No.
2 south level, which, when last heard from, was
facing rich veins of ore beneath an attractive outcrop.
It is hoped that No. 2 level will run into another
rich shoot past the 500 ft. mark. Development work
at the 115 ft. level in the Clansman mine is on very
sound lines ; assays over 2ft. give 10 p.c. copper and
15dwt. gold. When the copper market revives the
Mammoth may float one or more of its leases,
of which it holds a number, into a separate co.
* * * *
From Waihi (M.L.) : A young Australian
named Heskett, of Melbourne University, has, in con-
junction with Fraser, chief engineer of Waihi Vic-
toria Battery, been at work on the problem of com-
mercially treating Taranaki ironsand. They have
produced a steel which is equal to fine Swedish, and
it is claimed that they can, from a selling stand-
point, knock the foreign goods out of sight. Barry,
Rhodes, Banks (metallurgical chemist) and others
are understood to be financially backing the idea,
while Bill Massey and his Cabinet are understood to
favorably consider the matter of “concessions.”

Radium Extraction f S.A.) has made sev-
eral shipments of carnotite ore to London. The last
lot of 12 tons assayed. 2.29 p.c. uranium oxide and
realised £2O per ton. There is said to be an eager
market for ore assaying over 2 p.c. Radium Hill
IS.A.) hasn’t, apparently, attempted to get a price
for its concentrates, which assay up to 1.8 p.c., for
it has pluckily tackled the difficult problem of ex-
tracting radium from the ore. How it has suc-
ceeded cannot be told confidently, because the official
reports as to price realised are vague. All that can
be said is that a concentrate assaying over 2 p.c.
uranium oxide would greatly reduce costs.
Dr. Lazarus Barlow, noted for cancer re-
search work in Middlesex Hospital, reports that of
68 admitted cases of cancer, 32 were cured by radium
during the period June to' September, 1913 ; but he
talks strongly against the price of radium—£2o a
milligramme. Barlow says it would be possible to
sell it at a few shillings a milligramme, and make a
profit. Would it? If radium comes down to even
£5 a milligramme, what becomes of the Australian
Radium Co. and its works on Parramatta River?
The German prospector who was deserted
by his carriers and killed, and probably cooked, by
Papuan savages was on the right track when he
paid the big price for his courage. The punitive
expedition learned that the murdered man had found
gold—rich gold, though nobody knows if it is there
in quantities.
* * * *
The P. & O. Co., which had so outrage-
ously sweated its officers until they were driven to
a strike the other day, paid 15 p.c. on its ordinary
shares for the past year, besides putting by£459,91S
for depreciation and “further strengthening the
reserves.”

A
WOMAN’S
LETTER
Sydney, January 26, 1914.
My Dear Arini, —
The news that G.-G. Denman resigns his
billet is a frosty item for the numerous
N.S.W. lieges who heartily liked that kindly,
sporting little gentleman. Asthma and a
fiendish and persistent form of summer wea-
ther hay fever chase the popular Gee Gee
from Australia. An outdoor life, with as
little indoor stuffiness or officialdom as pos-
sible, is vital to his health. The recent
round of cocked-hat visits and speeches in
Westralia sent his Ex. to bed for a day or
two with the asthma fiend sitting on his
chest. The Denmans have been, as the Raw-
sons once were in this State, everybody’s
friends. They got right away from the arro-
gant little cliques that try to rule Govern-
ment House. The Gee Gee’s regrets at the
prospect of leaving Australia weigh several
tons.
Mr. F. J. Spence, general manager of the
Rare Metal Co., in South Australia, on the
Olary radium fields, is holidaying here till
Saturday. In March he goes off to Europe
on business bent. The Olary fields will turn
out —if they come up to the expectations of
experts—one ounce of radium a year, as soon
as the new plant is in working order.
Don’t scream, Arini, when you hear that an
ounce of radium is worth £1,000,000. Just
now, I believe there isn’t an ounce of radium
knocking about the earth’s crust.
Skipner Baynham, formerly of the Orvieto,
has been transferred to the Otranto. At
present he is somewhere on the Indian
Ocean, with his steering gear set for W.A.
General lan Hamilton and two-thirds of the
best-behaved members of the British peerage
are aboard the Otranto. Baynham, who is
one of the youngest skippers in the Orient
service, was tramping the deck one morning
on his last trip this way, when he was ac-
costed by an old lady who was the female
for Paul Pry. She was the mother of a
British Judge in Egypt, and had something
of the cross-examination touch herself. After
asking Baynham many questions, she said:
“Young man, you seem to know a good deal
about this steamer.” “I do, madam.” “Well,”
says she, “who are you?” “Oh, I’m only
the captain.” “The captain ! But you look
too young to have charge of a steamer like
this.” “Be reassured, madam,” said the
waggish Baynham, “I’m not nearly so young
as you fear. I paint!”
Miss Alexandra Helen Ganesco, a Rou-
manian heiress 23 years young, is on the
broad wet path between Colombo and this
continent at the present moment. She is
the handsome orphan daughter (with a mop
of nut-brown hair) of a Roumanian land-
owner and an Englishwoman. Miss Gan-
esco came of age quite lately (they set the
legal clock at 23 in Roumania), and shares
with an elder half-brother and sister a big
estate near the picturesque city of Bucharest
and its wandering river Dimbovitza. A
most impatient blue-eyed Briton—lst Lieu-
tenant Deane, of the Tingira—is hurriedly
ticking off the days till the Roumanian girl
steps ashore in this port. The wedding is
likely to occur on or about February 14 (the
date is not a fixture yet) in the Dockyard
Church, Garden Island. Miss Ganesco’s lit-
erary turn of mind won’t impress local So-
ciety. But it will thoroughly understand her
clothes. Part of the trousseau is hung to-
gether. as it were, on webs of antique lace
finer than gossamer.
Roumania, by the way, owns that clever
literary woman, Queen Elizabeth, the “Car-
men Sylva” of world-fame, and still the popu-
lar idol in the little kingdom where Carol I.
reigns over about 7,000,000, more or less,
belligerent subjects.
Rumor whispers that cricketer Macartney
is engaged to a Canadian heiress with money.
Every heiress ought to have money.
Jane Collins, spinster, aged 70, and pre-
sumably a Queensland property-owner in
comfortable circumstances, is or was (i ex-
pect she is washing off the dust when this
reaches you) bumping along the road from
Sydney to Melbourne. This item, that Jane
Collins was still able to thoroughly enjoy
a trip in a first-rate motor propelled by a
duly qualified chauffeur, has been mentioned
so often by way of a thrill that you begin
to think there’s something wonderful about
it. Then you reconsider it. Supposing Jane
Snooks, aged 76, hasn’t the price of a tram-
fare, and has to walk several sections to
collect her old-age pension, she is far more
active than the lady of 70 who is still able
to sit up, without prejudice, in a comfortable
vehicle. Still, there are so many Jane
Snooks that they don’t count. Pensioners,
moreover, are proverbially hard to kill.
The cable flashed the news that the late
Wigram Allen’s widow died in London the
other day. She was the daughter of a long-
ago N.S.W. Wesleyan parson, Rev. W. B.
Boyce. The Allen family, of Sydney,
climbed the stiff track to Much Money as
strong followers of the faith of Wesley, and
were pillars of that prayerful persuasion in
the lifetime of lawyer Wigram.
Poor old Dan O’Connor, a one-time Post-
master-General who made a success of the
billet, passed out in the N.S.W. Liverpool
State Hospital for those who have fallen into
financial straits. He probably got as much
variety (including the ’Frisco earthquake)
as do most people out of life in this uncer-
tain planet. He was a queer mixture of
childish vanity, ability, good humor and
blarney, and his besetting weakness for
painting the cabbage rose and regilding the
turnip often led him into a maze of adjec-
tives of unwieldy size. When the Royal
Yorks (now his and her Gracious, etc.)
were in Sydney, the Hopetouns’ ball gave
Dan an opportunity—he made the oppor-
tunity—to suddenly flop on his knees, having
carefully spread his handkerchief on the
floor, and kiss the large, capable hand of
Highness Mary. The attack was so sudden
that the lady who owned the hand came
nearer to giggling in the presence of the
herd than she is likely to have done since
she climbed into Queen Alexandra’s best
chair. The kiss was one of those loud, hearty
smacks like the report of air gun, and
secretary Wallington ripffled in smiles when-
ever he recalled the O’Connor salute.
Commander Lewin, R.N., of the training
hulk, H.M.A.S. Tingira, is moving off that
craft to the gunboat Encounter. The next
in command, Lieut. Browne, R.N., therefore
steps up a peg, temporarily anyhow, as the
man in charge of the big white ship that
floats on the dimpling face of Rose Bay.
This gives Mr. Deane, R.N., his chance to
jump into the togs of a first lieutenant.
Ex-Flag-Lieutenant Seton (who used to
shadow the Admirable King-Hall), the last
naval frill to join the Tingira, also goes up
half an inch or so.
The Frank Davenports’ only girl, Valerie,
is engaged to a German wool-buyer, who is
over here on business. His name is Lahau-
sen, or something very close to it. Papa
Davenport is a well-to-do lawyer of this
town, and his wife is one of the nicest-
looking matrons —of the unassisted com-
plexion school —hereabouts.
A Maoriland politician, Mr. David Buddo,
member for Kaiapoi in the House of
Reps., came ashore here the other day.
He is off to Europe for a six months’
drift round its best-known traditions. Buddo
is a prosperous farmer while he isn’t saving
the country, and when the early spring goat
is ripening on the tree he is seen at his
best. Also when the big pumpkin comes up
for its third reading, or the cow is in com-
mittee his vote can always be depended upon.
Commissioner G. H. Reid is slowly amb-
ling off this continent to soft music. He
has left Queenscliff (Vic.), where he has
been renewing old jokes and middle-aged
chestnuts with the veteran Simon Fraser, for
Dr. Ryan’s roof at Frankston, and this pro-
ceeding is to be followed by a meal or two
at Ballarat and Bendigo. Melbourne, with
a rush to the Apple Isle—February 21-26 —
then another rush to S’Australia (March
2). W.A. and the mailboat gangway are
due on the 10th.
The present scramble of our Pie Commis-
sioner through railway refreshments recalls
the tragedy of a supper he lost about nine
long, sad years ago, when the world was still
young. General Finn was travelling by
train at the same time as G. 11. Reid from
Melbourne to Sydney. At Albury an official
notified the soldier that there was a spare
carriage he could have to himself. “And
we’ll send you along some supper, General.”
“Don’t bother about it,” said the cheery
Finn, “a cup of hot soup is all I want.” As
the train jolted out of Albury, the soft in-
cense of fried bacon rose from a hamper in
the corner of the warrior’s compartment.
An old soldier never wastes an opportunity
for forage, because he never knows when he
may be leading his army across the Old Man
Plain and living on roots. He lifted the
cover. A big dish, steaming hot, of bacon
and eggs, met his eye, and there were other
things in flasks. He fell—that is to say, he
fell to. Next morning at Moss Vale he
heard G.H. bewailing the fact that he had
had no supper, though he had ordered an
extra supply of his favorite dish, as his
friend Dugald Thomson was with him.
Mutual recriminations of an affable nature
arose when the man who was outside the
feast owned to his contents. By one of
those blunders that happen in the best-regu-
lated trains, a hamper with knives and
forks and a syphon of sodawater had been
put in the carriage with big George. A week
or so later the supper eater asked the autho-
rities for an account of the cost of the ban-
quet. “Oh, that’s all right.” said authority;
“we charged it to Mr. Reid.” It must have
been the last straw.
The goff carnival is tearing round old
Kosciusko’s bare shoulder this week, for
Kosciusko wears its frock of grass cut low
and shows a lot of shoulder, also some front
and a good deal of back. About a hundred trip-
pers are camping in the Government hostel
for the Anniversary Day—and thereafter—
game of ball. The Austins of Deniliquin are
still firmly anchored in the mountain eyrie.
The pastoral Mcßeans, from the same sheep-
shod plains, are also goffing their hardest up
there. Colonel Braithwaite and son came
from Melbourne for the Kosciusko gambols.
The Jeannerets, of Hunter’s Hill, hurried to
the same altitude for the outdoor party.
Tourist-officer G. G. Neill, who sits in the
chair formerly more or less overcrowded by
genial Jack Cormack, fled to the goff links
to cast his eye around the scenery for dam-
aged tourists or lost balls. Mac Walker, of
the auctioneering Walker Bros., is also smit-
ing the elusive white marble on the everlast-
ing hills.
January and February are the migratory
months when Australians roll over, or off,
their continent like tennis balls on the spree.
The goff carnival at the Kosciusko camp is a
lure for all sorts of remote people during the
steamy coastal summer. The B. D. Steele
pair and Mrs. J. Barnes, of Brisbane, are
amongst those who cling, fly-fashion, to the
walls. and roof of our great pinnacle.
So is Mr. James Paton (Sydney),
who motored up with G. 11. Bosch in his
party. Mr. Paton, by the way, belongs to
the big Swedish telephone firm of L. M.
Ericsson and Co., which has an agency here.
So the goffing crowd beyond Cooma has
every opportunity of saying nice things
about the fiendish ’phone. Though the man
who sells the sound box can’t control the
wires he is an easy mark to have on the
premises in time of trouble, and people talk
to him just as a weatherbound party talks
to a professional meteorologist, under the
impression that he carries weather in his
carpet bag.
Dr. Scott (a brother of the late cricket-
ing-inedico of Scone) and his wife and
daughter are at Kosciusko (I hope
you’re not tired of that bald old knoll) just
now. The Summers, of Peat’s Ferry-road,
Hornsby—the house with the wonderful
garden—are loitering round the same breezy
eminence. John R. Hall, of Hall and Sons,
Newcastle, a keen motor man, talked of
spending two days and a bit on the road to
Ivos —you know the rest —but I fancy he
changed his petrol for the ordinary (very
ordinary) train service. (This is the train
that trails an anchor behind it lest it should
overrun its time schedule, and crush that
unfortunate creature beneath the cow-
catcher.) Electrical-engineer Holle and
“Sunny” Holme, the most popular lecturer
at Sydney Uni., are on the list.
An influx of Boy has been surging through
this town. The Belgian cadets, a more
serious-looking lot than the lately-departed
Yankee youths, are slowly munching local
hospitality. They arrived by train from Mel-
bourne. Mayor Richards broke their fall
into Sydney Harbor by impounding them
early at the Town Hall.
The National Council of Women chose
Hobart this year for its annual clatter. The
clatter seems to have raged with unabated
fury round the one per cent, female who is
too shrieking in her attire. The 99 normal
women, who don’t wear a rag of gauze over
next to nothing when doing the Block don’t
appear to have even been highly com-
mended. But the Council always claims
that it is misreported, so this may be an-
other gap in the evidence for the defendant.
Anyhow, Man, who has been taking care of
himself ever since Adam told the first im-
mortal truth about the apple, will henceforth
have the interminable resolutions and
amendments of the Nat. Council to protect
him from minxes who show their collar-
bones by daylight.
As no one else has done it, up to date,
permit me to heave a small brick at the well-
meaning enthusiasts who persistently refer
to the youngsters round about the Burton-
street jumble depot as “grubs.” This jumble
depot is run as a philanthropic hobby by
Miss Tatham and Miss Ynys Sutton. It is
a kind of sideline to the Girls’ Realm Guild ;
and members of that out-to-help fraternity
would steal the clothes off the backs of their
friends and relatives to send them to the
depot. There the garments are slaughtered
to folks with lean purses, at prices that
knock the ordinary bargain counter into the
middle of next year.
The kiddies of the neighborhood, who hang
round the depot, are never spoken of as any-
thing but “grubs” by the girls who run the
Greet Sacrifice. It is intended as a joke
relating to the generally unwashed appear-
ance of these waifs. What’s the State
doing that scores of children in one
neighborhood alone are growing up in the
streets? Where does compulsory education
come in?
A huge Californian publicity campaign is
about to start in Australia. The jump-off
will be in N.S.W. Behind this determined
search for tourists, settlers etc., are some
of the biggest concerns in California. These
have as assistant conspirator the Oceanic
Steamship Co., of which the genial V. A.
Sproule is general manager for Australia.
Mr. Wayman, recently Director of the
Ceylon Bureau (which closed with a bang
on December 31), has been offered the job
of conducting the Californian scheme
through this continent, and later on through
India and Burma.
The Loan Exhibition of Antiques is to be
held in Federal Government House. March
31 is the opening day. If any N.S.W. col-
lectors care to take part in this show, will
they drop a line concerning the wares they’d
like to send along? Her Ex. is anxious to
get as varied a show of old arms and legs
and curly backs—in the furniture line —as
Australians can muster. Old English cos-
tumes, tapestry and venerable brocades will
be tenderly treated and carefully returned.
Will intending exhibitors in the Momma
State write her Ex. cn this subject? She is
a collector herself, and knows how you feel
about even letting a cracked teapot out of
your sight.
George Forbes, a grandson of the first
Chief Justice of N.S.W., and a son of the
late Judge Forbes, lectured on the early his-
tory of this State the other evening. The
gathering mostly included people who are
prone to look into the clouded past, or people
who had some connection (real or imaginary)
with early N.S.W. officialdom. The gener-
ally-detested Governor Darling came in for
the kind of obituary notice that is generally
not seen on tombstones. The well-known
picture of William Charles Wentworth, with
a curling lip surrounded by an early Glad-
stone collar, was thrown on the screen to
illustrate his part in the festivities that
farewelled “the Tyrant Darling.” An ox
roasted whole at Vaucluse, to mark the
evening of the Governor’s departure, with
general rejoicing, must have been a ponder-
ous dish. The tactful touch-and-go manner
in which the lecturer approached and then
frisked away from the topic of “Prisoners of
the Crown,” was characteristic of the enter-
tainment.
U. N. Southwell, still somewhat of a sick
man. got back to his old office in Paling’s
last week. He may go to Europe for a
year’s travel by slow stages, loitering through
Italy as the most gradual stage of his jour-
ney.
Lizette Parkes, the beauty of the Waller
production of “Beaucaire,” seems doomed to
weepy parts. As Lucy Rellerton, Lizette is
mostly engaged in a tussle with unkind Fate,
and cousin Mary Carlisle’s haughty nose.
It is a small size in noses, with Madge
Titheradge in the Carlisle’s paniers, but
most toplofty. Lizette weeps at regular in-
tervals, and waters an inoffensive table with
her tears till she finally cheers up in the
last scene. The dandies of Bath in 1735
must have been a sorry-looking lot if they
were like the Lord Townbrake, Mr. Rakell
or Mr. Bantison, of the Waller Co. There
are only two pairs of legs worth mentioning
in the assembly. On these his curls of
Winterset (Frank Woolfe) and Major
Molyneaux (R. Dane) strutted round
the melancholy exhibition of silk hosed pipe-
stems.
A benefit matinee to mummer George Dean
will occur in the Little Theatre on Friday
afternoon. Fred Leslie; the inimitable Ivy
Schilling’s silken hose (enclosing the liveliest
legs in town) ; Carrie Moore fwho is or was,
or isn’t, or is, on the Adelphi panto, bill).
Jack Cannot and other busy people are
assisting. Hugh Buckler and Violet Paget,
who are back in the old stand, are also in
the programme.
Artist Ethel Phillips Fox has finished
sketching Manly surfers for the present, and
is packing up her paint-box for an attack
on the I'outh Coast. Hubby Phillips Fox is
expected here from Melbourne any minute.
He is putting the last strokes on the por-
trait of H. Gyles Turner for the Victorian
National Gallery, and has arrived at the
fierce combination of purnle and scarlet on
the robes of the Harry Allen portrait. The
last is to hang in Melbourne ’Varsity.
“Melba is likely to spend the coming win-
ter with her own kin in Australia,” says
John Lemmone, “if she can break her Covent
Garden engagements.” In a letter the flaut-
ist got from Mrs. Melba by the last mail,
she owns up to feeling tired after her strenu-
ous American tour, and she is a trifle home-
sick besides. April is the month in which
the Voice hopes to bump a few tons of lug-
gage on this shore —if the London opera
season is a breakable quantity. Melba says
she “saved a bit” out of the recent trip
through Dollar land. “The bit” is enough
to buy you and me, Arini, the nicest house
apiece in Sydney or Melbourne, and to keen
us, and a few of our friends, in luxury for
the rest of our lives.
Emil Greder, the big German operatic
singer wbo has been teaching here for some
years, is bouncing back to N’York.
Every now and again some inquisitive
citizen wants to know where the big silver
bell (presented in effigy to H.M.A.S.
Sydney months ago) is hiding itself. It
is on view in the show windows of its maker
and designer, jeweller and silversmith Saun-
ders, in that part of George-street which is
nearly opposite the Central Station. When
the Australian fleet churns its way back, the
citizens’ gift will be packed up and heaved
aboard the Sydney.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.
“An unusual interlude,” as the dailies
call it, enlivened a meeting of a Sydney City
Council Committee the other day, when
Alderman-Speaker R. D. Meagher com-
mented on the thickness of electrical-
engineer Mackay’s “hide.” Now, what can
Meagher know about “hide” or the right
and proper thickness thereof?

Base Brands, By h.
M- SOMER.
A snlendid account of the ways of sheep-stealers and cattle-duffers in the early days, recounted
by one whose merits as a story-teller are well known. The double life of the principal character
reminds one of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
Chandler of Corraliriga,
By R. J. CASSIDY.
The tale of an outback ne’er-do-well, who, for the love of the squatter’s daughter, determines to
turn over a new leaf. He takes what he calls “a sporting chance, and puts up a good fight. A
very unusual book, well worth reading.
Benno and Some of the Push.
By EDWARD DYSON.
The fun though sometimes fast and furious, is good-humored, and most of the members of the
push are worthy of the prominence given them. Bright, sparkling comedy, with a laugh in every line.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, January 26, 1914.
My Dear Yarrie, —
The Denman dame has temporarily placed
her children, their nurses and governesses
on the cool Mount Macedon shelf. The
energetic governoress runs upstairs occa-
sionally to see them, in the intervals of pre-
paring for the loan exhibition at Govern-
ment House.
The Denman lady recently discovered a
curious thing in the Gippsland wilds. Rid-
ing with her party through a forest of huge
dead timber, she pulled up for a drink of
water at a cow cocky’s place. As I re-
marked before, the timber everywhere was
dead, and, in addition, there was not a patch
of shade to be seen; yet the proffered cup
of water, which the Bible asserts is the least
hospitality one can offer, was not lukewarm,
but ice-cold! “Got it out of the tunnel,”
exclaimed the forest-dweller. The “tunnel”
turned out to be a cave just big enough at
the mouth to admit a man standing upright;
at the far end was the spring at which the
cup had been filled. Similar caves are close
handy to every home in the district. Ir
reminds one of Donald Macdonald’s descrip-
tion of the tunnels at Mafeking. Every man
had his own private burrow to dive into
when shelling started.
It was noted a while ago that the Mel-
bourne Public Library trustees had turned
the four colossal statues of Victoria, Albert,
Edward and Alexandra out of doors. All
four are awful slop works ; even though they
are from the chisel of a genius, the elder
Charles Summers, who did them just for Bill
Clarke’s money, and got Bill the baronetcy.
Now the statues have been put inside again
in deference to “loyal” protests. The view
of the artists is that they ought to be
shunted out of sight altogether.
Chamberlain Nevill, worn out with affairs
of State, bazaars, raffle tickets and the strain
of smoothing the Westralian way of his retir-
ing chief, has been resting for a fortnight at
Woodlands, the Sam McCullaghs’ place.
Woodlands was the favorite country haunt
of the late Hopetoun, who, especially during
his early period, spent happy weeks wander-
ing about the lovely old premises.
Professor Spencer is shaking hands with
himself, doing breakdowns, throwing hand-
springs, giving three cheers and congratulat-
ing himself by telephone. During his last
Northern Territory trip he sent his fine col-
lection of pictures to the Prahran Art Gal-
lery for exhibition. The Gallery was con-
siderably singed during the big ragtime
blaze, but the event happened after he had
resumed his property. The collection in-
cludes examples of Norman Lindsay, much
Streeton, some Longstaff and stuff by vari-
ous other artists of note.
Nowadays if you see a staid matron elabo-
rately jewelled for a morning shopping trip,
don’t conclude it is a foolish attempt to out-
glitter a favorite chorus pet. It is merely
of the results of the Maryann trouble.
A dame with diamonds in her ears and dazz-
ling on the chest of he’* simple washing
dress lately complained, “I feel like a real
tart! But I dare not leave these things at
home! You see, I have a new cook every
three weeks, and I can’t trust a woman I
don’t know, can I? And this” (pointing to
the visible gauds) “is not all! I have my
Mg emerald inside my corset!”
At the Vance-Forest wedding in Hobart
(when the widow Forest married widower-
medico Vance, of St. Kilda) Fate played
up with the motor-cars. Seven of them left
Bushy Park, the home of papa Philip Fysh,
and all of them had trouble of some kind
before they crawled furiously to the door
of St. Peter’s. But omens are not likely to
worry two people who have both faced the
altar rails before.
The Gaud Mayoress, after a period of
training at Queenscliff, is more or less ready
for the business of life, which consists of
bazaar plotting. The Austin Hospital
bazaar and a fete for the suburban kinder-
garten free schools are the first jobs on the
list.
Style, and plenty of it, was the distin-
guishing feature of Nancy Grice’s wedding.
A special train and a fleet of motors rushed
about 200 of the Best Fed people out to
Moondah, the parental shed at Frankston.
The decoration of the church, which had
been attended to by the Madden lady, was
less striking than that of the bride, who
sported a cream satin-gown, with diaphanous
corsage of rose point lace and swathings of
hemstitched tulle, which did not seriously
obscure its wearer. Nancy and her groom
(he has to be dragged into the par. some-
where) are going to Colombo for the honey-
moon. Did I mention that his name is
Jimmie Howatson, and that he hails from
a Bananaland squattage?
Alan Burgoyne, who has been hurrving
and fussing round this State ever since Cup-
time, is one of the youngest members of the
British House of Commons, and suffers from
swelled chest whenever he alludes to his
“Royal Borough of Kensington.” Besides
being the son of one of the big wine firms
of the world, Alan keeps the wolf from the
door by energetic journalism. “It pays
me> if extent of four figures
annually. He has already published two
books this year—one of them a German-
-Bntish view of the British Navy. (I think
you get this view by standng on your head
on the roof of the Admiralty and looking
through a pair of German spectacles.) Maga-
zines print his name in large type on the
cover when there is a naval article by him
within. He is a marine architect, with de-
grees from two countries, and tops his vari-
ous distinctions by being a dandy of the
nrst water. He. says he is merely trying to
live up to the ideals of his smart Austra-
lian wife, but that’s an excuse.
The Burgoyne firm, in Melbourne, has the
marriage craze badly, and each of the bride-
grooms-elect has selected an Australian girl.
Lamb, of the staff, has just fixed up with
Miss Weigall, daughter of the doctor; while
John Pym has extracted a promise from the
daughter of the F. T. Derhams, of Toorak.
The Burgoyne couple, on the day of their
< * ep i^^ ur . e or L n &l an d, dined the quartette
at Menzies’. The host himself carries away
a shilling on his watchchain- —a bet won by
motoring clear across the Coorong desert
(S.A.), with his sporting young wife for
company. (This motor item has no con-
nection with the Menzies’ function; but I
had the information about me and wanted to
get rid of it.)
Cecil Berry, one of the numerous family of
merchant Henry Berry, is to marry Elsie
Merrett, daughter of Major Merrett, of
Eden Park, Brighton.
Lieutenant Charlie Lord and one of the
Geelong Goldsbury girls are planning to say
“1 will” to a clergyman at an early date.
Squatter Stanley Keast, son of Keast the
Victorian politician, is going to resign his
freedom presently to Isabel Melrose, of Gre
Gre station, Hay.
The Jimmie McEvoys have suddenly pro-
jected themselves into the social limelight,
chiefly through taking Waverley, Dr. Ryan’s
house on St. Kilda-road. The motor that
waits at the front gate is one of the smartest
in Melbourne, and the grey horse that Airs.
Jimmie rides every morning is one of the
daintiest bits of horseflesh hereabout.
The Alfred Hospital bazaar is now look-
ing for a place to hold itself. It was
booked for the Prahran City Hall—the
place which was temporarily busted during
the fire. Now it is likely to dwell in tents,
like Jacob. The rich Alichaelis family are
the most weighty people behind this affair.
The National Council of Women has been
saving everything from everybody down in
Hobart. President Mrs. Henry Dobson first
greeted delegates from various parts of
Australia in stately fashion, then straight-
way began to thrash out the question of
sending representatives to Rome for the
quinquennial meeting (doesn’t it sound
splendid!) in May. Australia will have
only one vote ; but Congress feels it would
be safer to send a delegate from each Aus-
tralian State to see that the weapon
is used to the best advantage. Mrs. Dobson
herself was chief delegate to a Scandinavian
suffragist meeting, and she had two Council
women along to back her up, and shove
behind, and help form a hollow triangle.
The Barron dame, who has departed from
Tasmania,- carried away the proper imple-
ments and tackle for linking up the Fly-
speck with England, so the ’Speck now feels
that it is of some importance in the scheme
of hat Creation. The feeling was intensified
when the meetings had to consider an appeal
from the women of war-ravaged Bulgaria
and Greece for help. The secretary, refer-
ring to this touching matter, remarked that
“a message of sympathy had been sent, with
absolutely no reference to political matters.”
She smiled complacently over the diplomatic
settlement of that little incident. In the big
crises of life nothing is more useful than a
message of sympathy. I remember the case
of a man who was drowning in a well. A
friend and neighbor leant over the edge and
said, “You have my sympathy.” The un-
grateful one, splashing below, cursed him
for his trouble and then drowned. Don’t
you agree with me that he deserved it? I
mean, of course, the person who drowned.
The Women’s Council, wrangling in cool
Hobart, became quite parliamentary in its
language last week. During a discussion on
modern dress and its revelations, a young
member who was appearing for the defence
quoted the allegedly respectable Victorian
era. “The Early Victorian women damped
themselves to make their clothing cling to
their figures,” she remarked acidly. “Damned
themselves!” interjected a serious dame. And
the reporter present wearily recorded
(“Laughter”). The lady president, in
begging the Governor’s wife to forbid
the transparent female access to Govern-
ment House, made Hobart feel rather
nervous. You see her present Excel-
lency is herself a smart dresser, who doesn’t
object to cut-down yokes and pretty gowns
that reveal an expanse of good, presentable
back.
From “Rosna,” in London:—
Marjorie, second daughter of the Charlie Horns,
who were S. Australians until Broken Hill made
them rich enough to live in the Great Fog, is
to marry one Lawrence Pargiter, son of a late Secre- ,
iw to the Pun i ab Government. The bridegroom-
eXe£* 1S an ornament of Britain’s army.

It looks as though the only Julius, having
reached the mid-channel period, is going to
be guilty of the sin of over-dressing. The
evening frock he sports in “Diplomacy,” with
an unnecessary broad stripe on the pants and
a white silk handkerchief showing from the
pocket of the coat, is up to the limit. But
in a morning suit in the last act he is really
sartorially depressing. A white vest-slip, a
large bunch of white flowers, trousers of a
noisy pattern, and spats—large, assertive
white spats—combine to give him the ap-
pearance of a small stockbroker who has
achieved a sudden rise.
Musical people here are beginning to make
preparations for the lionising of Mischa
Elman, the very young man violinist, who
is now in America, playing his way towards
Australia.
Emily Dyason, the Bendigo girl who made
good as a pianist, and was for years a pupil
°. f the great Leschetizky, in Vienna, has de-
cided to pass on her accumulated knowledge
to a limited number of Melbourne students,
as well as accepting the occasional concert
engagement.
Two Melbourne women who contemplated
(splendid word!) paying a visit to Sydney
wrote in advance to several coffee-palaces,
hash halls and hotels for terms. The
Y.W.C.A. headquarters in Castlereagh-street
was among the number, and duly furnished
a reply, accompanied by an outline of what
was required of the guests. Here are a few
details : “Dressing bell, 7 a.m.; prayers, 7.30;
breakfast, 8. Residents are expected to be
present at prayers and punctually at meals;
every boarder expected to make her own bed
and keep room tidy. Should any boarder
prove herself undesirable, the superintendent
is empowered to request her to leave after
due notice. House closed and gas turned
off at 10.30 p.m. Boarders not allowed in
kitchen or pantry.” The Melbourne women
don’t object to a little mild gaiety now and
then, but this sounded too uproarious alto-
gether. I forget exactly what they did, but
rather think they wrote the Y.W.C.A. revel-
lers to the effect that, as they only wanted
a quiet holiday and not an orgy, they
couldn’t think of accepting their offer.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
The Ayers’ house on North Terrace has been
sold at last—to Mr. H. Woodcock, who bought the
old Exchange, in King William-street, some time
back. It is a roomy place, built by wealthy Henry
Ayers, President of the Leg. Council, when the city
was less crowded than it is now. Then the East
End Market arrived at its back gate, and after that
nobody rushed it at the ticketed £25,000. Most
times it lay empty, but it was used to house some
of the York retinue, and occasionally one of the
Ayers clan gave a dance there, and once even the
Adelaide Club rose to a similar reckless extrava-
gance. (The Adelaide Club isn’t usually reckless
over its entertaining—it gives one ball in 10 years
or so.) Some time ago there was talk of the
Adelaide Club transplanting itself to the Ayers’ pre-
mises, but the scheme fell through. The garden and
grounds are to be cut up.
Miss Fisher, a daughter of the late sporting Hurtle,
dashed off by the Melbourne Express on Tuesday to
visit a younger sister in Maoriland. She is 87
herself, and if you guess that the sister has been
promoted to long frocks you’ll be right.
Two weddings are booked for January 28 —the
Colley-Stirling event, at Glenelg; and that of Dora
Cudmore to L. M. Henderson, at Perth. Miss Cud-
more left for Westralia this week.
The Bosanquet twins are working steadily through
a list of farewell visits. The elder of them is just
back from Wellington Lodge, where she has been
saying good-bye to the Alan McFarlanes.
Beatrice Scott, third daughter of the late G. 8.,
of Mount Gambier, was married in November to W.
Bennett, at Rangoon. The wedding was from the
Herbert Woodhams’ house.
The two distractions billed for Saturday were the
Adelaide Rowing Club Swimming sports at Glenelg
and inter-State cricket on the Adelaide Oval. There
was a large attendance of people (some in attractive
frocks) at the cricket; but the swimming suited the
day better—it was hot and dusty in town and cool
at Glenelg. Also, there was some good sport. One
of the amphibious Luxmoores won the championship,
and R. L. Rhodes made off with the junior honors.
Miss LuXmoore was there, and Miss Dorothy Muir-
head, Mrs. A. Roberts, Mrs. O’Hara Hamilton, Miss
Zoe Reid, Miss C. Duff, Mr. and Mrs. McEwen and
Miss English.
More than one woman is rueing her love of a
bargain. The generous offer of 10yds. of silk for
half a crown sent a stream of postal notes from
this village to an Eastern city. At last the police
took a hand, and are now industriously returning the
postal notes to the gullible senders.
There was a boom in marriages in 1913 ; the voice
Breathed O’er Eden 4094 times, as against 4056
times for 1912, which was its previous best effort.
At this rate, Eden may be worn out. The record
of births also beats the previous year’s by 548, and
is 20 per cent, above the average for the last five
years. At this rate the stork may be worn out. I
remember once asking Jenkin Coles, who was our
Speaker for a quarter-century, how he accounted for
the improving figures. His answer was brief and
startling: “Artificial manures.” You see, Jenkin
Coles represented a farming district.
Our Public Works Commissioner, Richard Butler,
is on a visit to Melbourne, Sydney and possibly Bris-
bane, with his wife and daughter. In between
holiday-making, the Minister means to see what
N.S.W. and Yic. are doing with the Murray and

O.C.C. . Last Monday Sydney Tele-
gbaph published the following newfconcSn-
mg the Grandest Site in Australia:—
. T!'° U !r 6 haS , ar ! se " at th e Federal capital, owing
*°, th £ dismissal of a member of the Railway Workers’
l? n ® , L f bor ? Union > who declared that this
action was taken because he was carrying out the
instructions of his workmates, in having the drinking
water analysed. The administrator (Colonel Miller;
states that the man was dismissed for being absent
without permission. s
It is argued on behalf of the union that the
water tastes of the tar used in connection with the
P l P e s> and that the reservoir contains many dead
rabbits , the water having been condemned by the
Local doctor.
I happened to I’ead out this comforting piece
of news to a lady who is staying with us,
and she said that she had a sister who is at
Dryberra, where her husband is a contractor
for certain works on the majestic Cotter
River —the river that the Telegraph’s fish-
ing expert described as “a chain of water-
holes.” My lady friend had a letter from
her sister the other day, and she was good
enough to read some of it to us and to
allow me to quote this bit of it. (N.B.—
The letter is dated from the Cotter River
Works, 13th Jan., 1914) :
Oh, the heat here ! It has been simply unbearable
these last three or four weeks, and the dust has been
something cruel. They talk about the dust and heat
of Cobar, but I am sure this place could knock Cobar
into a cocked hat 1 We HAVE NOT HAD ANY
RAIN to speak of ever since we came here, and that
is THREE MONTHS ago! Yesterday a storm came
up, and we had a few drops, but only a few, which
made the air a little cooler. . . .N— has gone to the
capital site, where they ARE TALKING OF SUS-
PENDING ALL WORK FOR SOME MONTHS!
If that is true, it won’t be worth while staying
here, as there is no work for N — in Queanbeyan.
The Grandest Site in Australia ! Condemned
drinking water! No rain! Dust worse
than Cobar! Dead rabbits in the Dryberra
Federal Tank ! River a chain of water-
holes ! etc. What a noble “city” Canberra
is going to be! As O’Malley says, Rome,
Venice and Athens were only circumstances
to what this place MAY be!
“F.H.” : Several new suburban churches,
of _ various denominations, have lately been
brilt in Melbourne on the up-in-a-day, no-
debt-to-pay plan. The trouble with this
sort of building, of course, is that it is liable
to suffer from white ants, lack of paint and
early decrepitude. A Camberwell . (Vic.)
priest, known for advertising purposes as
Father Robinson, has shown another way.
A more lasting temple of stone, at the top of
a Camberwell hill, has been paid for almost
entirely through the employment of adver-
tising-space in a whole lot of newspapers.
“Ten shillings for a stone” was the Robin-
sonian watchword, and now up she goes.
This reverend father is identical with the
cleric who boomed Amy Castles for all she
was worth; while another more recent effort
was uproariously advertised as “Father Rob-
inson’s Bazaar.” The Camberwell presby-
tery at which this enterprising priest writes
his uplifting ad.-matter has one of the finest
gardens in the neighborhood. The father
himself is a mild-mannered, white-haired per-
son, who looks as though he had never
thought out a screaming ad. in his life; and
he never carries a megaphone around with
him—nothing but a stout waddy and a purse
containing two and ninepence.
“Incas” darts in and out of a few
libraries: —
For accessibility to the books and for the comfort
and convenience it offers to readers, the new Public
Library in Melbourne is second to none on earth.
The public reading-room is approached by the best
foyer in marble to be seen in Australia. Some of
the material is Australian, though, regrettably, most
is imported. We have in Gippsland the colored
marbles, chiefly antico-jellico, from which all the
celebrated statues of the famous Greek sculptors were
evolved. The colossal statue of Athene and the
Olympian Zeus were carved by the great Phidias out
of marble similar to that to-day exposed in the wilds
of Benambra, within 100 miles of our future Aus-
tralian capital, and lying idle! The Melbourne
Library’s reading-room is gorgeous, elegant, full of
air and light. Everything bespeaks comfort, and the
ease with which one can enter and get a book is
delightful to a democrat. In the Bibliotheque
Nationale, Paris, the biggest collection of books in
the world, it is most difficult to get either in or
out, while to secure the tome you want is a task for
Hercules. Melbourne’s modern collection of books is
really excellent. The library of the British Museum,
created by an Italian called Antonio Panizzi, has
only of recent years become a people’s library,
though, as a copy of every new publication must by
law be deposited with the librarian, its books run
into 2.000,000. Most of them ought to be burned.
In the Alexandria Library, in Egypt, all the laws,
sacred and civil, and all the known books went into
one edition of the Books of Thoth, about equal in
size to the Encyclopaedia Britannica as now printed
on Indian paper. The two best libraries in Britain
are the Advocates’ Library in Edinburgh and the
Bodleian Library at Oxford, and even there I’d like
the job of culling the needed books and committing
arson on the rest. The oldest library I’ve seen is at
the Vatican, Rome; the youngest at Buenos Aires,
Argentina—both remarkable, one for its antiquity,
the other for its worthlessness. Three fine reference
'■braries, fine because the librarians are eclectic, are
those of the Colonial Institute, Geographical Society
and Asiatic Society, all in London. For pretentious
libraries, I would go again to Berlin, Brussels, Copen-
hagen and Munich, all “Royal,” and all containing
mostly the records of dead kings and the mostly
stupid men and women who surrounded them.

sighted critics regarding the bushman’s- literary
appetite. The charge is that accused’s taste is for
blood-and-thunder and a class of books which to
most readers must appear as utter rubbish. For in-
stance :—•
He caught her to his breast in a passion of frenzied
love, while she gazed into his limpid eyes in a
swoon of ecstatic joy.
I have occasionally come across such bound tripe
in a far-out hut, but the samples were kept only
for the joy of reading them aloud to an hilarious
mate. Yet books of the sort are written for sale,
not for pastime. The authors would go very hungry
if they depended on the far-scattered bushmen for
their public. And will somebody tell me if Garbage,
for instance, goes hungry? I do not allege that the
bushman devours the Encyclopaedia Britannica in
his spare time; I merely emphasise that he is not,
as one donkey says, “a literary degenerate.” It is a
rarity to meet one of the tribe who does not appre-
ciate sound books. Whenever he gets a chance, he
reaches at good reading matter with both hands.
GOING BACK.
IST RETURNING EMIGRANT: “And what did
you do in A Australia?”
2ND DITTO: “Twelve months.”
“Windan Rayne” : Tamworth’s unexpected
blow-up of last week reminds me of the narrow storm
that hit Thompson’s place while Thompson was in
the garage attending to the car and to Thompson’s
immigrant groom, who had brought his matchless
ignorance all the way from London on purpose to
annoy Thompson. Thompson had had his servant
for one suffering month, when the tornado arrived
without a breath of warning and threw the roof
of the stable, the water-tank, a tree, a pig and a
buggy straight at the door of the garage, breaking
it in and filling the place with water, branches,
crashes, squeals, scuffles and shrieks. Thompson
didn’t go wild with terror, as you might suppose.
He merely dashed .down his spanner like a disturbed
hero, faced the deluge and sudden death, and roared,
“What the Devil are you doing nowt”
“Avis”: When the 19th century opened
there were four species of emu within the Common-
wealth. Three have disappeared right off the earth.
Tasmania, King Island and Kangaroo Island had
each its own emu. The Tasmanian pedestrian fowl
lasted up to about 70 years ago. The other two
are known only through Baudin, the French ex-
plorer. They were very small as compared with the
Australian or Tasmanian species. Of the King Island
species the naturalist Lescueur left a valuable colored
drawing, while some of the Kangaroo Island lot
were caught and taken to Europe, where their skins
are preserved. Before the protection of the Aus-
tralian emu began, the records of slaughter of that
feathered running brute were astonishing. At Cal-
landoon station (Q.) men were kept killing them
at Is. 6d. a head, with 6d. each for eggs. In less
than three months 900 birds and 1600 eggs were
destroyed. And then there has been the slaughter
due to settlement. Fenced off from water, they
have perished in drought time in vast numbers. Tom
Carter, a Westralian grazier, counted 75 corpses
within 200 yards. The bird has been blamed for
spreading priekly-pear; and while he was no doubt
guilty there was a set-off in his insectivorous value.
In the crop of one bird enough grasshoppers have
been found to fill a bucket. Given a chance, the
queer bird is well able to keep the cradle busy.
Often there are a dozen eggs in one clutch, and Mrs.
Emu rears her families until she is nearly as old
as the Biblical Sarah. A pair of birds kept in
captivity in Victoria bred for the first time after
16 years, and reared a brood. The eggs take nearly
two months to hatch. The male sits on them all
day. The hen’s shift lasts for only a few hours at
night.

“Silas Snell”: The bush is the land of
lots of time. I stayed at Lowe’s while we were
putting up a 20-head battery on the Wellford mine,
in the Bungaree district, and in due course became
studious of Lowe’s daughter Kate. Kate must have
beeen 28, even allowing for the fact that bush girls
who have had lifelong dealings with Cow almost in-
variably look 28 at 20. Kate’s life was a long
monotony of Cow. I can’t say how many cows Lowe
possessed, but there were three paddocksful of them,
and Kate was always doing something with milk or
with calves when she was not attending to the
wants of the seven boarders. I suppose Kate did
sleep some time, but from my point of view she was
always up. Lowe was a slow, bony, silent man, with
no discoverable emotions, but I gathered that he
hated Armstrong. Armstrong was the son of a
neighboring farmer, and when I won a little of
Kate’s confidence, she informed me that dad was
“up agin Andy.’’ I asked for further information.
It seemed Andy was an infamous scoundrel —he
wanted to marry Kate. Dad hated the idea. He had
even bought a gun to discourage courtship between
Andy and Kate. “But it don’t make no difference,”
said Kate. “We’re goin’ t’ git married, all the
same. We’re goin’ to elope.” “When?” I asked.
“Oh, some day. We can’t do it now, ’cause, you see,
we’re 18 mile from the railway here, and Dad’s
horse Jasper is the fastest in the district. Unless we
had a real good horse, Dad ’d be sure to overtake
us half-way. But it’s all right”—here she looked
about anxiously, and dropped her voice—-“ Andy’s
breedin’ one.”

“Gouger”: Up here in the Far North of
Queensland, out from the beaten tracks, are little
isolated communities of Chows, mostly on tin and
gold fields. For instance, Canni-
bal Creek, so named from the
liking for Chows’ flesh cultivated
by brother Binghi in the early
Palmer days. They have their
own butchers’ shops and stores,
and their own Chinese packer,
with his mob of 25 or 30 horses.
They are the most clannish people
in the world. All their require-
ments come through the Chinese
at the nearest port. In return
the inlanders send down their
tin, gold or sandalwood, as the
case may be. This concentration
of business, helped by the support
which some poor whites give him,
makes the Chow storekeeper very
prosperous in time; and the glit-
ter of his success turns more and
more of his countrymen’s eyes
this way. The Jap also abounds
moderately, but he is mostly in
the laundries and cook shops of
the “mixed” towns. He is not
like the Chow. Hard graft is distasteful to him.
Peeling spuds and bossing a ■ gang of niggers on a
beche-de-mer boat are jobs more in his line.
• * * *
“The Maorilander”: An ugly little critter
out West is the devil-spider. His chief comestible
is ant —sugar-ant for preference. He spins no web,
but digs himself a small, funnel-shaped hole in a
warm patch of sand handy to the galleries of an
anthill. This hole is about an inch and a half in
diameter and an inch in depth, the sides being of
loose sand and the whole resembling a tiny crater.
Sitting coldly yet affably in the bottom, lightly
veiled with sand, the devil-spider leaves the rest to
Providence. Presently an ant scurries into the pit,
a pair of sharp forceps realise on his life assurance
policy, and the spider finishes his meal with rapidity.
A general clean-up follows, and the trap is set again.
In the event of the ant within the crater attempting
to scale the wall the sinister gentleman throws jets
of sand at him until he tumbles down in an avalanche.
Once within reach of the enemy’s eating apparatus
the ant has about as much chance of escaping as an
oppressor of the poor with tallow legs has of getting
out of the place specially prepared for him.
REASON ENOUGH.
OLD LADY: “ Now, remember, you’ve given me your word that you won’t spend the
shilling I gave you at the nearest hotel.”
TALE-PITOHER : "Madam , I will not. die's a ’ ard-’arted man wot keeps that pub , an' I
owe ’im a shillin’.”
“X.P.D.”: That yarn of “H.S.” (B.
8/1/T4) about the ceremonial slaughtering of swine
in Malekula (New Hebrides) prompts me to remark
that the Mamba River (Papua) ■ people kill pigs by
drowning them. The unclean beasts, lashed fore and
aft to poles, are carried between two men to the
handiest waterhole, where the rite of complete im-
mersion is performed. Considering the prevalence of
big noses and circumcision among these river-folk, I
wasn’t surprised when they explained that they
murdered their pork that way so as not to waste
any blood.
* * * *
“Lagani-Namo”: A couple of Bulletin
scribes trot out a 20ft. dive of One Douglas Pitt,
of Cairns (Q.), as something of a performance. It
isn’t. I could pick a dozen “boys” out of any
Papuan coastal village who can kick themselves
down over 30 ft. and tie ropes to things on the
bottom. I’ve had “boys” using crowbars in three
fathoms for over two minutes at a stretch. Captain
Kunson, of those' parts, had a “boy” who won him
a bet of £5 by bringing up a specimen of beche-de-
mer from a depth of nine fathoms by the lead-line.
The man who dropped the fiver reckoned that the
lead-line was a liar, got it measured, and apologised.
Twenty feet 1 Why, the brown infants who amuse
tourists by diving for thrums at Port Moresby jetty
wouldn’t reckon that anything wildly enormous in
the way of a dive.

“Marloo”: Andru was plainly perturbed,
and when he approached me on the seventh round
with the duster I inquired the reason. This is what
he told me. “Lasta night I get dressed up, puta
on da best clobber. I goen out Chatswood see da
girl, what you calla da sweetheart. I get offa da
train, and walka long da road. By-em-bye in da
lonely dark place a man walka up and bump into
me. We both bega da pard. I start on agen, and
I theenk I see what da, time. By jinga, I getta da
shock, my watch gone. I runna back, catcha da
bloke by da troat, anda tella him, ‘You givea me da
watch.’ He get -terrible fright, and givea me it.
When I leta him go he runna like da dev. I preety
lucky I theenk getta da watch back. I go along,
havea da good time and cornea home 12 o’clock.
By cripe, sir, I get da bad shock. When I geta
home I see my watch on da bunk. I forget it when
I goen to seea da tart. I theenka da John arresta
me for bein’ da burglar and da thief. You tella me,
sir, what I do.” When a constable acquaintance
whom I brought along after explaining the burlesque
to him, had departed with the timepiece, which
closely resembled Andru’s gun-metal turnip, a large,
bulging Dago wept audible tears of relief on my
freshly-starched collar.
“Gouger”: The ideas of Binghi pass
all sober understanding. Here is one of the Spring-
vale (N.Q.) natives, who won’t walk 20 yards by
himself in the dark. Filled with centuries of accu-
mulated hate, of unavenged feuds, lurking behind
every shrub, or invisible in the atmosphere, is the
tribe of 'the people of the little spears. Said spears are
only six inches long, but any foolhardly night-
walker will surely stop one, and, from the hand of
UP TO DATE.
“’ Owever, ’ Erbert, we are dressed in accord
with the time.”
“’Ow so, ’Enery? o which time do you
refer?”
“Rag-time!”
the unseen thrower, that means instant death. The
little spear-throwers are the spirits of men belonging
to hostile tribes, and the fear of them around these
parts is very great. No matter how long a boy may
have been in a white man’s employ, and supposedly
civilised, it is impossible to get him to walk beyond
the pale of the camp-fire on a dark night.

The Chinese refugees in Kobe are swelling daily.
—Recent press item.
Up in Kobe by the sea
Lands the genus refugee,
And his numbers are increasing,
So they’re telling;
But although hi» phizog blithe
Now is sad, his figure lithe
Has grown fat beyond all credence,
And is swelling.
’Tis a quaint effect of fear
In that heathen atmosphere,
That it seems to stretch the girth to
Strange dimensions;
And the waist of him who flees
When there’s trouble on the breeze
Is a matter always calling
For extensions.
If you see a heathen troop
Looking much as if a hoop
Would be useful where the waist is
Softly rounded,
You may guess beyond a doubt
’Tis the crew they hunted out
When the ship of China’s freedom
Lately foundered.
And a vision looms ahead
Of a day of terror dread,
When the Mongol will be mighty,
Past all quelling;
Not because of brawn and brain,
Or of Culture’s coming reign,
But because his Middle Kingdom’s

T urbo- Alternators
THE efficiency of any Turbo-Alternator depends, to a great extent, on
the ventilation system. In a “Siemens” Turbo-Alternator the
ventilation is well-nigh perfect. The cylindrical rotor and special
improved system of axial ventilation effectually prevent any over-heating.
In our polyphase machines the rotor is a solid steel forging, manufactured
in one with the shaft —thus ensuring great strength. We have already
built, including machines now under course of construction at our Stafford
Works, some 144 machines of this class. Amongst them we may mention: -
Two 4400 Kw. 3-phase sets for Melbourne City Council.
One 2500 Kw. 3-phase set for Melbourne City Council.

“Werrimee”: A settler in the Collarenebri
district recently found a litter of five baby dingoes in
a rabbit pit on his lease. Having digested the
assurances of some Abo.-liars as to the cowardice and
non-combativeness of the warrigal, he confidentlv
dropped into the pit, and opened the question with
a club. In a few seconds he wanted to leave the
premises in a great hurry. The pups tackled him
with unanimity, fangs, claws and spectacular lan-
guage whereby he was numerously bitten on both
legs before he had time to scramble out. He then
despatched the cowards with a rifle from a safe dis-
tance.
NOT DRESSED FOR COMPANY.
REV. C. GREEN : “Ah, well, no doubt it's for

“Pick”: Ou the North Coast of N. S.
Wales, where for many successive seasons there has
been a superabundance of rain, paspalum grass may
assume such rankness of growth as to merit the wilt-
ing curse of “Caius Marius” (B. 11/12/’l3), but in
the arid south, where the cow-worshippers have ex-
perimented largely with Rhodes, crowsfoot, cocks-
foot, ribbon and other artificial grasses, paspalum
is held in universal esteem as the champion drought-
resister of the lot. In the driest times the bluish
green patches under paspalum mark, like an oasis in
the desert, the dry, brown areas of the far-across
plains—that is, where the rabbits allow it to make
its mark. With bunny, paspalum is also favorite.

“Silas Snell” : I met Brogan while I was
rusticating at Saddle Hill, pretending to enjoy a
fortnight’s holiday and unremitting ham. Brogan
was the local constable, as fine a man as ever trod
in shoe-leather. He told me so after I had reduced
myself to a condition of destitution by financing a
brotherly state of intoxication; for Brogan was an
extremely sober man, by which I mean he could
only be made otherwise at great expense. Brogan
was a splendid sample of the exiles of Erin, 6ft. 2in.
up and down, about four across, and
nine by the long route round, and as
peaceful a sinner as ever gave fond
welcome and shelter to a big beer, or
a full set of the same. I was told
the tale of Brogan and the burglars.
They were two city experts who had
been put on to the local bank. Brogan
took up with them early in the day,
and by closing time he had them so
hopelessly pickled in Lloyd’s non-
corrosive, shark-toothed, galvanic
whisky that he had to arrest them
for their own protection, and put
them to bunk in his own bed. Next
morning he had a talk with them.
“I know yer game,” he said. “Now
you throt away home t’ yer wives an’
childther in Melbin there, an’ don’t
bother a pacable man wid yer breakin’
an’ entherin’.” That sounds like a
tale of the woods, but my own ex-
perience of Brogan convinces me it
is true. While I was writing a letter
in Lloyd’s bar parlor, Brogan stole
into the room on tiptoe, and hid him-
self behind the door. “What is it?”
I asked, inclining an ear to the racket
in the bar. “Hold yer talk!” ad-
monished Brogan in a whisper. “ ’Tis that roarin’
divil Finnerty I’ve been wantin’ this 10 months
goin’ past.”
“Numph”: Biljim, from the outer back-
blocks, was visiting Sydney for the first time, and
a religious friend got him to attend church and
stay to the finish. Questioned, later on, concerning
his new experience, Billjim remarked: “They got
a boshter melodion, and the feller can pitch all
right; but a poorer counter-lunch I never struck.”
“Recko”: The other Sunday morning
some small boys were at work trying to be good
in a Waverley (N.S.W.) church. The verger, or
whatever they call the Lothario who shows people
to their seats, has a habit of crooking his finger
and beckoning the people, and when they come up he
shows them in with much gesticulation. The small
boys who were trying to be good were mimicking
the shopwalker, when, on turning round, he caught
them at it, and made a grab at one of them. The
small boy bolted hatless out of the door, and was
just rounding the corner when he ran into the arms
of a John Hop. “Where yer goin’ ?” demanded
John Hop. “A row on up at the church,” said the
kid, breathlessly. “An’ they sent me for a police-
man.” J. Hop hurried up to church, and, wishing
to be polite, stood at the door with his hat in his
hand. The verger, under the impression that he
had a new convert, crooked his finger, and on the police-
man going up to inquire what they had done with the
body, the verger pointed to a seat where only one
man was sitting. J. Hop walked over, and asked
the man not to make a disturbance in church, but
to come quietly. He went outside, and they had a
drink, or words to that effect, and everything was
fixed up to the satisfaction of everybody but the
small boy. This story may or may not be true, but
the incident ought to have happened, if it didn’t.
Art Criticism by “A. William Cann”:
My friend Norman Lindsay was guilty of a queer
solecism in his sketch (B. 15/1/’l4) of a newly-
arrived immigrant absorbed in the prehistoric task
of billy-boiling. Everything about the central figure
of the picture—his check suit, his small cloth cap,
his large, meaty feet and hands, his enraged yet
futile face—was redolent of England ; the section of
England, that is to say, which supplies us with
immigrants, remittance-men and the like. There
was nothing in the remotest degree Australian about
Lindsay’s newchum—with one exception. The excep-
tion was his fire. It was one of those small, neat,
effective conflagrations which none but the bushman
of infinite experience has the knack of making. Nor-
man himself, for all his divagations back o’ beyond,
has never made such a Are, and I fear never will.
His prowess as boat-builder, picture-frame maker,
gardener, carpenter, camera-constructor, and odd-job
expert generally—to make no mention of his notable
skill as draughtsman and painter—prove beyond
question his capacity to use his hands. But mere
technical genius is not enough to produce the com-
plete fire-builder. The proper temperament is re-
quired ; also years of practice. It must be a couple
of decades, now, since I first brought “Jimmie Panni-
kin” to Australia. Since those far-back days we have
divagated pretty constantly together. Yet only the
other day, on my ordering the faithful fellow to
build a fire, he proceeded to incinerate a mass of
dry wood sufficiently extensive to grill a megatherium
on. Ten minutes later, to paraphrase Henry James,
two elderly gentlemen might have been seen fleeing
a-down the wind, scattering perspiration and cooking
utensils and oaths behind them, while the flames for
which they were responsible roared madly to the
heavens. The fire of the oldest of old hands is often
like this ; the newchum’s effort, always. For Norman
to represent one of the latter class as the author of
the sort of fire that just gets there and no more, so
to speak, is as though he were to draw the lay-reader
at the chapel where he worships in spangles and
tights, or a surfing costume.
“Eddyson”: As Taunton scurried home-
wards, his tracks took a lock-stitch pattern, and
his head betrayed an absurd disposition to precede
his legs. He made precipitate dives into the atmo-
sphere, followed by rapid little runs to overtake his
equilibrium. Here and there he paused along the
route to dictate terms to himself, or to renew a
bitter argument with Dan Rafferty, whom he had
left behind at the pub. Three times his head in its
haste to secure precedence overdid the thing, and
John Taunton fell on his nose, and skated a pace
or two, to the great detriment of that appurtenance.
Before attempting to rise, John made bitter speech
re the un-British and infamous conduct of Cousin
Jacks in hitting men when they were down. Getting
up again, John Taunton put forth heroic but mis-
directed efforts to push his wrong end into the atmo-
sphere. He seemed to be trying to stand on his left
ear. Brother Praetor’s boy Ernie saw him fall the
fourth time, and marvelled at the resulting phe-
nomenon—John had disappeared! He was no longer
an attractive feature of the landscape. Ernie in-
vestigated, and discovered the open shaft of the old
Crescent mine. This offered some explanation of
Taunton’s absence from the surface aspect of things.
It occurred to little Ernie that the matter would
make interesting conversation for the home circle. He
dawdled along, and forgot John Taunton in a dispute
about the ownership of a wire-haired terrier and a
string. The string was attached to the terrier with
whom Ernie was engaged in contentious argument.
Little Ernie Praetor arrived home with two bites
and no dog; and naturally the mishaps of John
Taunton were not referred to till late in the after-
noon. Then Praetor organised a search party, car-
ried the rope, and volunteered to go down and recover
the body. The old Crescent shaft was 80ft. deep, and
nobody entertained roseate views with regard to the
fate of J. Taunton. The shocking mortality was
already being woven into potent and pious speech
for use at the forthcoming meeting of the Miner's Rest
and Piggoreet Band of Hope. Praetor found the shaft
quite dry. At the bottom he lit his candle and looked
round for the mortal remains. But no mutilated
corpse awaited delivery. That gentle sense of disap-
pointment which assails weak man bereft of his
tragedy smote Praetor; but he did not leave imme-
diately. Faint reports from the black drive at-
tracted him, and he advanced diffidently into the
darkness, holding high the candle. About 20 yards
in he discovered a man. The man was making lum-
bering movements along the wall of the drive, utter-
ing blasphemous complaints about the quality of the
track, and profane libels on the Shire Council of
Piggoreet. Presently Taunton, for it was he, came
to where the amazed Praetor stood transfixed under
the flickering dip. He gazed gravely at Praetor for
half a minute; then he said: Goo’ ni, mate. I bin
(hie!) walkin’ ’long thish ’fernal street fer hoursh.
I live bottom Ballarat-road; can you tell me do I
take firsh turnin’ to left or (hie!) firsh turnin’ to

much as sprung a button.

“Onlooker”: A fat Maori wahine, arrayed
in a print dress of many colors, boarded a Welling-

passengers, and the Maori woman, to help retain
her equilibrium, was forced to hang herself on to a

“The nation has much to answer for in its treat-
ment of the natives,” writes the president of the
South Australian Aborigines’ Friends’ Association in
his annual report. “Some of the reserves allotted
to them have been sold, their happy hunting-ground
taken, and they have been driven into very limited
spaces by the advance of civilisation.”
Ah, tffey stole away your freedom with their ’baccy
and their rum,
With the tomahawk and Bible and the surreptitious
“thrum” ;
And they ran a steely ribbon over hills and over
plains,
Till the iron horse went snorting through your
primitive domains—
Over rivers stretching wide,
Where your fishing arts were plied,
Ere the White Man came and doomed you with the
baseness of his brains.
Then the kangaroo went fleeing in unprecedented
flight,
And the ’possum that you feasted on no longer
graced the night.
The gohanna (olden dainty) saw the sight with
startled eyes,
And skedaddled as did Adam through the gates of
Paradise;
And the much-respected snake,
That you used to sweetly bake,
Looked out on the proceedings with a very pained
surprise.
Then we fed you on the dishes that were poison
unto you,
And we placed a roof between you and the widely-
arching blue ;
Next we brought you (oh, so slyly) many gallons of
red rum
(That you generously paid for with the surrepti-
tious “thrum”!);
Aye, and now, as a result,
You are in Doom’s catapult—
And all ready to be hoisted to the end of Kingdom
Come.
We dispensed you forks to feed with, and we gave
you clothes to wear
(It is true they didn’t fit you, and they needed
much repair) ;
Then we gave you hymns and sermons (our solici-
tude was grand !),
And a host of other treasures that you didn’t under-
stand—-
And some nicely-bottled fire,
To placate your fierce desire;
In fact, we gave you all you wished—except your
blessed land !
It was kindness—and it killed you. It was tragic
it was vain ;
Better far had we but left you to your peril and your
pain;
Left you to your juicy ’possum, and the snake
upon a prong,
And the luxuries you hunted ere the White Man
came along;
Let you see the open skies
With your eagle-visioned eyes—
If we d left you thus, Black Brother, you would now
be going strong!

Sanatogen Brings New
Health and Nerve Force.
** I have used Sanatogen with extra-
ordinary benefit. It is to my mind a true
food tonic, feeding the nerves, increasing
the energy, and giving fresh vigour to the
overworked body and mind.”
These words by Sir Gilbert Parker, M.P.,
the well-known author, have a helpful
meaning for you —if you need real help in
one of those crises of life when your health
is giving you anxiety.
They echo a sentiment of gratitude which
is expressed in many different ways in
thousands upon thousands of letters from
men and women who owe to Sanatogen new
strength and vitality.
The Rt. Hon. Sir John Gorst, member of Hi*
Majesty’s Privy Council, writes: “Sir John
Gorst wishes to say he has long been acquainted
with the great merits of Sanatogen —has taken
it with excellent results, and when necessary
will certainly take it again. It was also used
by a daughter of his with great benefit.”
To you who are run down, nervous or
weak—to you who are less than yourself —
Sanatogen will bring new health. To you
whose nerves have gone wrong, and whose
appetite or sleep or capacity for work are
impaired, Sanatogen comes as a rescuing
sustainer, a revitalising force, a feeder of
nerves and tissues.
Write to-day for a Free Booklet, entitled
“ The Art of Living,” to Messrs. A. Wulfing
& Co., 17, Bond Street, Sydney, N.S.W.
Kindly mention this paper when writing.

The Ballade of the Snore.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Australia is as yet only half awake to her possi-
bilities—and her dangers. —London Times.
There’s a sleepy White Australian, in the
middle of his nap,
Never dreaming, not a moment, of the chance
of evil hap;
He’s a notion he can borrow on for ever from
the Yids,
And that Aaron will be patient when his
ancient debtor bids;
And should you try to rouse him to his
dangers, he replies
That he’s not the “sort as shivers at a lot
of silly lies.”
Then he starts again to snore,
As he did an hour before,
Till he’s startled by the thunder of a knock-
ing at the door,
And the voice of Jacob calling for his “mon-
ish” at the door.
A lovely storm was raging in the Balkans
t’other day,
And the Eagles soared expectant where the
carrion marked the prey ;
Mother Britain might have mingled in the
m§lee any hour,
And she knew the deadly danger that was
threat’ning to her power;
But the sleepy White Australian never wor-
ried —not an inch
(He’s a fatted calf, and peaceful, that has
never felt the pinch).
Though the cannon madly roar
He continues with his snore;
He will scarcely even waken till they bang
his very door.
Till the foes of Britain beat her and assail
his very door.
There’s a little man to nor’ard who is calling
out for room,
And who knows the way to get it when the
guns of battle boom ;
It was he who battered China, brought the
Russian to his knees—
Can you wonder if “Exclusion” with his
stomach disagrees?
He has battle-ships in plenty, he has fighting
men galore.
And a flimsy bit of paper will not keep him
from the door
Where the owners lie and snore,
At their ease for evermore,
Till the voice of Nippon clamors for admit-
tance at the door,
Till the myriads of the Mongol come a-knock-
ing at the door.
And I look a-down the Future, through its
histories sublime,
And I hear the books retailing to the babes of
Coming Time:
“ ’Twas a country fat and wealthy, such a
lovely land to loot,
But its people never thought it worth their
while to learn to shoot.
So the foeman came one morning, down the
leagues of careless shore,
Quite expecting to be greeted with a surly
cannon roar;
But, instead of guns and gore,
He could only get a snore
Prom the loons who lay in slumber while he
shattered in the door,
From the nidderings who were nodding there
with Nippon at the door.”
QUEENSLAND.
A SNORER.
The Chow in His Own Land.
“R. 8.” sings a sweet song from China: —
The Bulletin’s par. on the Chinese method
of preserving the ginger which Ah Sin offers
the Australian woman as a Christmas present doesn’t
exhaust the Pong’s peculiarities in food preparation
by many a thousand gallons. The Chinese are the
most casual people in the world in the matter of
their own food; how, then, are they to be trusted
with the provender of the foreign devil? From the
hungry mothers of many children who live on sam-
pans and comb the harbor for edible garbage at
Kowloon, so that the gulls and other sea-scavengers
suffer unfair competition, to the almost-naked but-
chers of Hongkong, the handling of victuals in
China is a nightmare. The land is more like manure
than soil —teased, pulverised and bound again with
heavy natural fertiliser- —for nothing that can smell
badly is wasted; so it is prudent to see a farm on
the Chu Kiang before you eat salad in Canton. The
people are clustered so thickly that their cities teem
with life like a rotten midden, and but for the
incense all the 500 wooden gods in Canton would die.
Cats sleep among the greenstuff and the salads; a
poulterer’s stall is a horror of dead ducks, pale as
if they had died of arsenical poisoning; and there
are shops for the sale of rats, of fish scraps, of the
flesh of dogs and cats, and of horses that have per-
ished of natural causes. Mangy and half-starved
curs rest and nose among the food ; and every other
Chinaman has a catarrh. Corpses are kept in the
house of death for 49 days at least, and for as long
thereafter as the astrologer may consider burial un-
lucky ; as if any day were unlucky for a funeral to
the beneficiaries under the will. And around the
cadavers are rice, and sausage skins, and fruit, and
greens; and fish entrails, and charcoal,' and earthen-
ware pots, and spring onions, and mandarin oranges on
the stalk, and rats, and cats and eggs. A lot of the salted
duck-eggs that come to Australia for pastrycook
purposes have sueh lodging for a time. Smallpox is
with them always and there are 10,000 lepers in
Canton. Cholera and diphtheria are epidemic; the
smell of filthy frugality is over all; the habit of
depositing the most unspeakable rejects in a savings-
bank is associated with the vilest of communal cook-
ing, and duck and pigs’ feet are “washed” in the
Chu Kiang River at the mouth of a sewer entitled
“The River of Tranquil Joy.” They export ginger
and cumquats and tamarinds from this delectable
City; and also inhuman hair—hair dug up from
cemeteries to make the switch and transformation
for the women of the foreign devil. It is as useless
to make Pure Food Laws for the food which Aus-
tralians prepare for Australians, while admitting
all these abominations of China, as it is for Wages
Boards to make high wages for Australians while
the tariff admits imports manufactured by the
sweated labor of the rest of the world.
: ♦
“Incas” : Walking along the beach beyond
Sandringham (Vic.) one hot day lately, I
saw a crowd gathered round a man who was
being held head downwards to let the water
run out of him. Then he was laid on his
back and his arms were worked vigorously
by two aviateur life-savers so as to pump
air into his lungs. Next they turned him
over on his face and worked his head up and
down, likewise sideways. He didn’t seem to
recover very rapidly, although much energy
was put into his restoration. Then a small
boy, after careful examination, remarked:
“That bloke ain’t been in the water —he’s
fell off the cliff.” And so he had. When
the doctor arrived he tersely explained the
case as one of broken neck.
Business, Robbery, etc.
“Hamer”: The scheme by which the Sydney retail
beef-mongers have averted immediate disaster on the
Saturday half-holiday question is ingenious and com-
plicated, but it isn’t likely to permanently fill the
bill. The “family order” shop is to close the front
door of its steak at five, and the “cash shop” is to
adjourn at six on five evenings of the week, and to
shut on Wednesdays and Sundays. But the assistants
want the Saturday half-holiday, so the trouble is
only postponed. Heaven knows what will happen.
It is a big strain for the left-over meat to keep
decently saleable in summer from 6 p.m. Tuesday
to 8 a.m. Thursday, but the unsold sausage will per-
ish by the way if required to fight the good fight
from noon on Saturday till 8 a.m. on Monday. And
if the lady of Paddington or Surry Hills —who has
no ice-chest—has to buy her Sunday meat at 11 a.m.
on a blazing hot Saturday,, her husband will
assuredly hold his nose at her and say things to her
by Sunday night. In this miserable world, boots
and clothes and hats and most groceries and all
kinds of beer, rum, gin, whisky, lemonade and sun-
dries will keep for 44 hot hours; but soft fruits,
meat, butter, milk and ice won’t, except by the
special grace of Providence. So the cost of the
stuff that goes bad is dabbed on to the price of the
stuff which keeps good. Of course, there is a way
out—there always is—but who will take it ? The
trade in perishable necessaries should be specialised,
and the shops should keep open, say, 11 hours per
day including Sundays and holidays. The places
that don’t deal in perishables—draperies, banks,
insurance offices, boot-shops, jewelleries, drinkeries,
pugilists’ emporiums, surf-resorts, dogfights, churches
and the like —should close a little earlier than they
do. And their people—the people who get this
special relief —should put in compulsorily, say, one
day each per annum relieving the butcher or fruit
shop assistant or ice-man or what not. There are
so many drapers and other dealers in dry substances
that one day a year from each of them would pro-
bably put their less fortunate brethren on a level
with the rest of the community. And it would be
unadulterated joy when a bank manager or a bishop
came round about dawn on Sunday, and delivered
two chops—a large one and a small one—over a
back fence in Paddington, and Mr. Johnson, full of
last night’s beer, spoke his mind fully and freely
about the small chop.
* .* * *
“Vagabond”: Here is another hint of the un-
pleasant pill that may have to be swallowed sooner
or later by the grab-all city ports of Australia. The
Edinburgh daily Scotsman— amongst the first half-
dozen, in circulation and influence, of the British
dailies—has an article booming Hobart and giving
the straight tip to shipping lines that this is the
coming port of Australasia, and that it is worth
keeping an eye upon. “There is no finer port in the
world,” says the Scot, and describes the pier and
wharf accommodation, actual and projected, winding
up- with: “In fact, Hobart will be the only Aus-
tralasian port capable of accommodating the largest
liners afloat.” After which it goes into details of
the times occupied on the present mail service—
Adelaide 29 days, Melbourne 30, Sydney 31, and
Brisbane 32 via the Suez ditch, which limits the
size of the ships in the service. Then it points out
how by the Cape route a large 21-knotter could get
to Hobart in 24 days, so that mails forwarded bv
fast steamers could be in Melbourne in 25 days, and
in Sydney in 26. And, finally, the Scotsman rubs
in the fact that the Norddeutscher-Lloyd has already
jumped in with a direct line to Hobart, and leaves
the obvious moral lingering in the air that J. Bull
had better hurry, if he has such a thing about him.
* * * *
“Pick”: In an early par. “Coorey” made the
assertion that the N.S.W. sleeper-passers were taken
down every day in the week, except Sunday, by
fraudulent cutters. Later on he alleged that
the officers of the new Forestry Department have
friends at court who wink the other eye when timber
that ought to he condemned bears the passer’s mark.
What is it that “Coorey” infers against the for-
esters? Negligence? Fraud? Or just incapacity?
If the last, let me say that, before appointment, the
forester has to undergo examinations that only
experts in timber have a hope of passing; and, if
it’s negligence or fraud, I should like him to tell
me how the forester can arrange to have his timbers
fall into the hands of his one-eyed friends for final
inspection. Also, if foresters can so arrange matters,
how was it that two of them recently got bumped
out for carelessness in letting faulty stuff through?
I knew the S’African consignment of sleepers that
caused the big row—knew it, perhaps, better than
“Coorey.” It was not all the scrapings of the bush,
as he describes; it contained much serviceable stuff,
but the faulty and undersized pieces brought about
the condemnation of the whole pile. As a result of
the blue Sheol then raised the passers nowadays
throw out the very best of stuff if it’s an eighth of
an inch short in measurement, and they are equally
alert in detecting the old bushman’s tricks for hid-
ing defects. But it’s no use arguing. A writer like
“Coorey,” who asserts that grey gum is passed as
ironbark, is simply talking through the fly-escapes
in his hat.

The Royal Dutch Petroleum Co. recently issued
40,540 shares in London at £6O each, the face value
being £8 6s. Bd. On this co.’s shares a dividend
of 41 per cent, will be paid for the year 1913. The
list was only open two hours, and the issue was 10
times over-applied. The co. is part of the English
‘Oil Trust, which is a rival of the Standard Oil Trust
of U.S.A. Its chief oil wells are in Borneo and the
Dutch East Indies. Oh, yes! they have trusts in
Freetrade countries. Plenty of them.
* # * *
“Tinggi”: Re the profits in cocoanut planting,
which the Age has been talking about through its
neck. Even The Bulletin’s 7s. per tree per annum
is high, though I’ll allow it was given as an outside
figure. Up in the Celebes and the Moluccas ss. a
tree is reckoned a good return these days. Say 50
palms to the acre, and there you have £6OO a year
gross on the Age man’s ideal plot of 40 acres, com-
mencing the seventh year after planting. He would
not get even that much if he waited till the fruit
fell off before collecting it for market. Supposing
he did get it, it wouldn’t all be his by a long chalk.
He’d have to pay and feed six or more ordinary “nigs”
for weed-cleaning all the time; and (with his ex-
perience) he’d want also a boss “nig,” at, say, treble
one ordinary nig’s upkeep. In the first place, any-
how, before planting at all, our man would have to
size up properly his neighbor’s palms and the char-
acter of the fruit (to get at the quality of the
ground), while, if in virgin country, some boring or
pit-sinking, to 30ft. in several places, would be re-
quired. Otherwise his trees, after five or six years’
growth, would probably strike a mud-patch for a
“bottom,” and then it would be all up with our man
and his 40-acre plot.
AXIOMS OF THE STOCK EXCHANGE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Buy forward and you’ll go backward.
'there is more money made by selling than by
buying.
“Heads I win—tails you lose,” said the broker, as
he added 1 per cent, for commission.
Nobody ever sold at the top of the market or
bought St the bottom.
Beware of the tip that everybody knows.
Never tell a secret till you have operated all you
want. After that a breach of confidence means
profit.
Never destroy reputations with words. It’s safer
to do it with a shrug of the shoulders.
Doubt a balance-sheet unless the auditor is backed
up by an angel’s affidavit.
Figures were invented to conceal facts.
A director is a man who directs the secretary
to pay him his fees.
A solicitor is one who asks for free shares.
A secretary is he who keeps the company’s secrets
to himself until he has operated. After that he tells
the directors, and, when they are finished, the secre-
tary tells the shareholders.
An auditor is an honest man—unless you pay
him.
“Working costs” are as close as you can work to
the facts without publishing a loss.

Simplicity because there are no spring fastenings, no locking rings,
no “contraptions” of any kind to trouble the operator.
Safety because the rim is held in position by solid steel clamps,
bolts, and nuts, quickly and easily fastened or

Sydney. 12ill .Tan., 1914.
We hereby certify that we have examined the bills, compared the balances and counted the coin in the
Head Office of THE COMMERCIAL BANKING COMPANY OF SYDNEY, LIMITED, and have compared the
returns of the Branches, and have found the same as specified in the foregoing Balance-sheet.
E. S. CAPE,
F. W. HIXSON,
Auditors.
The following resolutions were carried unanimously:— , . . . .. ,
“That the Report and Statements of Account be received and adopted, and ordered to be circulated
among the Proprietors.” . _ , „ , „
“That the thanks of the Shareholders he presented to the Directors, General Manager Officers
of the Bank for their very satisfactory management of the affairs of the institution.
T. A. DIBBS, General Manager.
In moving the adoption of the report, the chair-
man, Mr. George J. Cohen, said—
I am pleased to say that our operations for the
past six months have been of a very satisfactory
character, as you will gather from the balance-sheet
now before you. Before moving its adoption I will
point out the principal features in it in comparison
with the figures of the balance-sheet of 12 months
ago, in accordance with our usual custom.
Looking first at the debit side you will see that
our capital has been increased by £236,000. Of the
fresh capital of £250,000, authorised in September,
pavable half on December 31 last and the balance
in June next, £226,000 has been paid, leaving only
the comparatively small sum of £24,000 to come in
by next June to make the paid-up capital of the
bank £2,000,000.
Our reserve fund has been increased by £90,000,
and with the appropriation now recommended will
stand at £1,680,000.
Bills in circulation show an increase of £212,000,
and deposits and other liabilities have gone up
£566,000. Profit and loss shows £8679 better.
During the period, £11,544 of our notes have come
in and been paid, leaving a little over £25,000 out-
standing. The total figures show the satisfactory
increase of £1.100,000.
Turning to the assets side, I may point out that
our coin has beep increased by £1,450,000. largely
by the transference of funds from London for more
profitable employment here, but, of course, assisted
by the increase of our capital, and by ordinary trade
operations.
Money at short call in London has increased by
£125,000, and bills receivable in London and remit-
tances in transit by £132,000, while the holding of
Australian notes has decreased by £28,000, and in-
vestments in Government debentures by £166,000.
The result of these changes is a strengthening of
a little over a million and a half in our liquid
asets, and their ratio to our liabilities to the public
is a shade over 54 per cent.
Our lendings have decreased during the period by
■c 431.000, a great many of our loans to graziers and
farmers being reduced by the arrival and disposal
of their wool, wheat and other products earlier than
usual.
PREMISES ACCOUNT shows an increase of
° 16.000. I may remind you that each half-year it
is our practice to make ample reduction in this
account, and during the year no less than 13 new
branch premises have been erected and finished.
You will observe also in the report that we have
added £5OOO to the “T. A. Dibbs Officers’ Relief
Fund.” This fund was instituted by a gift of
e 5000 bv Mr. T. A. Dibbs in September, 1907, to
provide relief to any of the staff who might suffer
from illness, distress or misfortune of any kind.
It has proved a great boon to the officers, and in
the short period of its existence 62 grants aggre-
gating upward of £2OOO have been made from it.
The principal is now £15.000, only the interest being
used for the purpose of the fund.
I now move that the reports and statements of
account be received and adopted, and ordered to
be circulated among the proprietors.

After eight years’ constant work Mr.
Edison is satisfied with the Edison Stor-
age Battery, and not until it had met
more exacting tests in the laboratory and
more strenuous practice than the con-
sumer will ever demand of it was its
public announcement permitted.
Made from iron, nickel, potash solution,
it totally eliminates acid, improves upon
its initial efficiency and combines with
this necessary factor of reliability, light
rugged strength so necessary if electric
vehicles are to become popular.
These Batteries have been tested under
severe conditions with heavy loads for a
period of three years, which in itself
should be sufficient guarantee of their
dependability.

If the test of a session’s usefulness was the num-
ber of bills introduced, the last was a very successful
session. If the test was the number of Bills passed,
this was the most barren session he remembered. — Vic.
Oppositionist Elmslie on Watt’s slaughtered-innocents.
THE WICKED MOTHER: “Ah, maybe they
didn't live LONG, but, thank 'eaven, I DID
do me dooty to the country—and each wun
of 'em was worth a bunch of voles to me,
too! ”
By “Bildad” :
There has long been a tendency in Labor circles
to grumble at the Eight-Hours Art Union, and the
tendency is growing. It is complained that the
gamble is too mean, the swindle too exorbitant, and
the “rake-off” beyond the odds. Of the money put
into the show, about 80 per cent, is annexed, and
20 per cent, returned. That is worse than the steal
of the average bookmaker, landlord, land-speculator,
usurer, sweater or other traditional oppressor of the
poor. It looks like a confidence trick, and it beats
Tammany out of sight. The wretched thing isn’t
worth the disgrace and the moral contamination.
Even the Standard Oil Trust doesn’t demand quite
so big a profit.
THE VOICE OF EXPERIENCE.
RESPONDENT: “ I'll stick to the truth!”
HER LAWYER: “ Do! do!—anything rather than let them worm it out of you! ”
The Tariff Commission in its present
manner of working promises to be a lovely
means of advertisement for the special
“lines” of retail traders. For instance, a
witness who keeps a shop in Melbourne _ for
the sale of boots, mostly imported, seized
the opportunity to mention some “bargains”
that lay neglected on his shelves. The fashion
journals had predicted a boom in shoes of a
certain color, he said, whereupon he im-
ported £3OO worth. “But by the time the
goods arrived nobody wanted them, and,
though he had them in stock now, he could
not sell them even at cost price.” Imagine
the effect of that announcement in next
day’s report of the Inter-State Commission!
The steady inflow of lady customers asking,
in a tone of affected indifference, for the
shoes which were on offer at cost price!
“Record Clerk” : The instalment of Hol-
man as Treasurer of N. S. Wales has the
Public Service guessing what peregrinations
the Premier’s office staff will make. Just
now the officers are in the Chief Secretary’s
building, where Holman, as Premier, hangs
his hat up. But when he becomes custodian
of the lOU department, they will have to
amble across the street to the loft in the
Treasury Buildings. When McGowen was
Premier and Treasurer, the Premier’s staff
was at the Treasury, but when he jaunted
to London. Acting-Premier Holman, who was
Attorney-General, ordered the whole outfit
up to the Crown Law Department. Car-
michael, Acting-Treasurer, heard of this
when the clerks were half-way up Macquarie-
street. Holding the view that this particu-
lar staff belonged to the Treasurer, he or-
dered it back. Holman peremptorily ordered
it forward again, and the staff spent
a windy day trotting up and down, to the
great joy of the chorus girls and flappers
waiting to be fitted with brass fangs at the
overlooking windows of the dentists’ parlors.
“Q. 1.8.” on another aspect of the S’Afri-
can tangle:—
General Beyers, one of the minority of the Boer
leaders who voted against the signing of peace at
Vereeniging, and now Commandant of the Transvaal
Defence Forces, let the tip of the cat’s tail out of
the bag when addressing the mobilised commandos at
Johannesburg the other day. After, pointing out
that the whole force had mobilised in three days, he
added that it showed that they could “manage their
own affairs without the help of the Imperial troops.”
The great majority of the Dutch, represented by men
like Beyers, de Wet and Hertzog, chafe at the main-
tenance of ' the hated “Khakis” in their midst.
Though the Imperial garrison has been greatly re-
duced, Britain still insists on maintaining units at
various points, the pretext being the danger of a
native rising. Except perhaps in Natal, the citizen
forces are more than able to cope with such a job,
and even there they, practically unassisted, handled
the last Zulu irruption with credit and dispatch—
the enemy getting most of the dispatch. Of course
the honest truth is that, in spite of oceans of
“sniff.” Britain is not too sure of her new subjects’
“loyalty.”
“Norseman”: Mildura, the River Murray
“temperance” township without a pub, has
of course a club, which drank £12,048 11s.
worth of beer and spirits during 1913.
Archdeacon Boyce will, I’m sure, be de-
lighted with this triumph of No-License.
The first serious attempt to repair the
N.S.W. shortage is the indefinite suspension
of the sinking fund payments. So debt is to
be paid off by ceasing to pay off debt.
An obituary notice of Lord Strathcona
states that, “In the crisis of the Boer war
he equipped and sent out, at a cost of about
£200,000, Strathcona’s Horse, the famous
regiment of Canadian roughriders, who cov-
ered themselves with glory in the field.”
Well, it was only a thin covering of glory
that Strathcona’s hardy braves put upon
themselves. On the rare occasions when
they killed a Boer or two in action they
scalped the deceased.
The recent Sydney wharf-trouble —now
deceased —was a regrettable business, but
the explanation offered is worse. It is al-
leged that some bogus person went round
the wharves professing to have authority
from the union officials to direct that over-
time work should be stopped. It was
stopped. Then the messenger was proved to
be a sham, but the wharf men, instead of
going back to the old order of things, felt
bound, on a curious point of honor, to main-
tain the partial hang-up till the weekly meet-
ing had ordered a complete resumption of
work. If the story is true it was a curious
and expensive point of honor, and a remark-
able success for the prowling sham. Appar-
ently it was more important to keep faith
with him than with the union.
Poor old Melbourne Argus still believes
in the possibility of reversing the White
Australia policy, and whenever it mentions
the Northern Territory it drags in a nigger
of some sort. Its latest flick to the same
old dead horse was this: —
Because Dr. Gih-uth has good health, on account
of his hard work, it does not follow that white men
will work in the fields for wages. You can never
find white men who will stop long at field work or
mining. And, moreover, if you could, the country is
too poor to pay union wages. The oldest of the
residents will tell you that the only way the Terri-
tory products, both mining and agricultural, can be
developed, is by the cheapest of coolie labor.
Sugar couldn’t be grown without the
Kanaka, yet more sugar is produced in
Queensland to-day than ever before. We
are spending millions on army and navy to
keep Australia white, and this ancient
dodderer advocates letting colored people in
as slaves to become conquerors later.
Curiously enough, the Argus article is
headed “Fighting Nature.” This is just
what the Argus is doing—fighting the
nature of the Australian, which is to keep
Australia white.
North Melbourne has said something that
reflects badly on its character. A political
league there asks that the cop should come
round in plain clothes to fix up the electoral
roll, because many people, when they look
through the window and see a bobby in
uniform waiting, lie low and pretend to be
out. Consequently they don’t get on the
roll. Now the person who reconnoitres
through the window before opening the door
may simply be poor through undeserved mis-
fortune, or may be tormented by fish-hawkers
and book-canvassers. But the person who,
after reconnoitring, doesn’t open the door
because there is a policeman on the step is.
better left off the roll.
Victoria presents the weird spectacle just
now of an uncompromising Protectionist
State Treasurer kicking because a Govern-
ment whose head used to be a notorious
Freetrader levied Customs duty on an article
that the former was importing. The anom-
alous position arose through Watt having
borrowed a dredge from Maoriland, more
or less temporarily, on which weapon the
Customs department charged the legal duty
—some £4OOO. Watt characterises the pro-
cedure as an “extortion,” and he declines
to pay, and defies Australia to make him.
The real importance of the occurrence
is the evidence which it supplies that
the duty on dredges isn’t nearly as
heavy as it ought to be. There is
a State shipyard at Williamstown, and!
several private ones on the Yarra, where
dredges can be built by the mile and cut off
according to requirements, wherefore the
habit of going abroad for such haberdashery
ought to be discouraged.
N. S. Wales Treasurer Cann, wearing
peacock feathers because the underwriters
of the last loan have, after the manner of
their kind, worked the market up to ai
premium in order to sell out at a profit, re-
marks that the credit of the individual
States is equal to or better than the credit
of the Commonwealth. The reason, he says,
is that the States own the assets. Evi-
dently Cann supposes that Cohen has his eye
on the bridge at Boggabri and the 10 chains
of road at McGinnis’s Crossing, and is quite
satisfied that they are good security for his
money. When Cann knows a little more
about finance he will realise that what
Cohen has his eye on is the taxable wealth
of the country and the capacity of the people
to pay Customs and Excise duties. They are
the only assets Cohen cares two beans about;
and, as Cann may observe, the power of the
Commonwealth to levy Customs duties is
exclusive, while its power to tax land values
—the biggest item in the country’s wealth —•
is unlimited.
BOTH DOING WELL.
The commission appointing Dr. Maloney, Messrs.
Sinclair, Foster, Patten and Laird Smith a Royal
Commission on electoral matters has been signed....
An unusual provision has been included in the com-
mission, allowing the commissioners, for the purpose
of taking evidence, to divide themselves into two
parts. Either part of the commission will be able
to meet and take evidence separately. —News item.
Half a crown each way—or a most amicable
arrangement.
Watt of Victoria follows the lead of Cann
of N.S.W. in refusing to go “cap in hand”
(they use the same -old gag) to the Federal
Treasurer on finance matters. Well, why
shouldn’t Watt leave his cap at home, and
go to the Fed. Treasurer in a nude condition
with his boots under his arm?
The strike or crisis or whatever it might
be called which arose last week among the
cow-murderers at Homebush (Sydney) ran
on the usual lines. The union officials, who
are supposed to exist that they may deal
with industrial problems, weren’t even noti-
fied that anything was about to happen.
The men were working under an award of
the Court, but nobody paid the slightest at-
tention to the award. And nobody enforced
the award, or attempted to do so, or even
thought of doing so.
“T. 0.1.”: Edward Butler and the just-
dead Daniel O’Connor were the only two
R.C.’s appointed to Ministerial office—one
as Attorney-General, the other as Postmaster-
General —by Henry Parkes, who formed five
Cabinets, and held office as Premier for 11
years and 10 months.
WQRTHY WARRNAMBOOL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. Murray (Warrnambool) said: “There are a
good many people whom, honestly, I would not trust
*—whom I would not like to see holding the pre-
ponderance of power. It would be a very dangerous
thing for the safety and welfare of the State if they
did.” He then went on to say more specifically who
these dangerous people are. They are the dwellers
in the cities. .. .What is there about a man who
lives in Melbourne less trustworthy than there is
about a citizen of Warrnambool? —Melbourne Age.
Let’s say a word for Warrnambool, the purest of the
pure,
Where, year by year, the citizens in righteousness
endure.
They never drink their beer in pints, nor use the
postal vote,
Nor know the crimson gaieties that surely help to
bloat
The swollen, sinful cities such as Melbourne. As
a rule.
They’re good, kind, gentle, open-hearted folk at
Warrnambool.
Daily along the narrow way persistently they plod
In drably solemn clobber clad, in sober broad-toes
shod.
They never beat the Government, nor pole upon the
State
For cheap advice and farmers’ seed, new roads and
railway freight.
Ah, who would bust their virtue up with city votes,
and sool
The dogs of revolution on the lambs of Warrnam-
bool?
The breeze that blows from off the sea at Warrnam-
bool cavorts
Across a region mostly blest with virtue-loving sorts.
Not one of them in trading mokes is ever on the
make,
Nor yet would start a stable-fed to win a grass-fed
stake.
It would be wicked easy for a Melbourne sport to
fool
The simple, honest, safe, baa-lamblike lads of Warr-
nambool.

DISLOCATED SHOULDER.
UNABLE TO USE RIGHT ARM FOR
SIX MONTHS. COMSTOCK’S NERVE
AND BONE LINIMENT AFFORDS
WONDERFUL RELIEF.
“As I always believe in giving credit
where credit is due,” writes Mrs. E. Maher,
of “Nil Desperandum,” Dartbrook Road,
Auburn, N.S.W., “I am sending this state-
ment in praise of Comstock’s Nerve and
Bone Liniment. Just twelve months ago I
dislocated my shoulder, and for about six
months suffered continually, being unable
to do any work that necessitated the use of
my right arm. I was treated by a doctor
and also tried various liniments recom-
mended by different chemists, but all to no
purpose, the severe pains still continuing.
After being in this state for about six
months. I one day read an advertisement
containing some testimonials from people
who had benefited by the use of this remedy,
and so decided to test it myself. After try-
ing the first bottle I felt much relief. I ain
now using my fourth bottle, and find I can
use my shoulder with considerably more
ease, and intend continuing to treat myself
with Comstock’s Nerve and Bone Liniment,
as I know of nothing to equal it. I am
only too pleased to allow you to use this for
advertising purposes, and would confirm
same to anyone calling on me.”
This liniment is sold by all leading
chemists and storekeepers, price 2s. 6d., or
will be forwarded by post at same nrice by

NOTIONS
The recent Motor Reliability Test from
Melbourne to Sydney was either insufficiently strin-
gent in the regulations or else the modern motor-car
has attained a very considerable altitude of effici-
ency—chiefly through the agency of such tests re-
ferred to. Anyhow, the percentage of finishers to
starters was very high. But, all the same, some
valuable light was shed on matters that have hitherto
been seen as in a glass darkly. The heat during the
run was terrific, soaring in some places to 107 deg. in
the shade, so the test of cooling systems was very
severe. In a number of cases the thermo-syphon
system failed badly, but on other cars it worked
perfectly. Careful investigation proved that there
was nothing wrong with the system, but that some
awful blunders had been made in the application
of it. Sufficient head of water is not always pro-
vided above the conduit pipe to the cylinders, so
when evaporation lowers the water below a certain
level, circulation fails. This is a manufacturer’s
matter purely, and should only nee;} mentioning to
bring about rectification. Buyers of cars should be
careful to purchase only engines with plenty of
water space above the conduit pipe. Another fre-
quent trouble was the failure of the oil supply, which,
in many cases, had to be replenished during the
lunch control. No car on which this is necessary
even on the hottest day on a run of 168 miles can
honestly claim to be up to date; and any decent
manufacturer should be ashamed to put his name on
it. A large number of cars suffered with broken
front springs. Certainly the going was very rough,
but the fact that it is rough between the two prin-
cipal cities of the Commonwealth proves there is
vast room for improvement. No less than 85 points
were deducted for 17 broken sheaves of springs.
Apparently longer springs and more leaves are the
obvious remedy. In the days of the first tests bent
front axles were common. Hardly a car got through
without sustaining an injury of the sort. In this
test only one car of the 25 that started managed to
do that trick, and that was due to the driver’s atten-
tion being taken off the road so that he plunged into
a deep V-shaped gutter. And just as the manufac-
turers have improved the front axles so they can
better the front springs. The electrical department
came through very well, though there was some
trouble with sooted sparking plugs. A magneto
gave some annoyance in one instance, and in another
a high-tension wire plug vibrated out of the
magnetos. There was only one case of a leaky
radiator. But hereabouts one cannot help remark-
ing that the English, American and European
machine-builders do not make the radiators large
enough for the Australian climate. When a car is
running with the wind and the heat is about 105 deg.
or so in the shade, it is probably about 200 deg. in the
sun, and the machine is sucking in hot air all the
time. Small wonder the water boils. We want
larger radiators to dissipate the heat than they do
in Britain, Europe or even the United States. There
are a few other remarks that might be made, but these
will be to go on with.
Motor-car stealing is a popular and lucra-
tive amusement in Britain, Europe and the U.S.A.,
but it is quite a new sport in Australia, and a some-
what dangerous one. It was a Randwick (Sydney)
man the game was played on first. The driver left
the car for about 10 minutes while he went into a
house to collect his fare. There was apparently diffi-
culty in scraping up the required amount, and when
the ‘shover” reached the street again, it (the
street) was empty. The car had walked ; and accord-
ing to late advices at the time of writing is still
walking.

The hollowness of the Good Friday Sport
question was prettily shown last week at Hindmarsh,
a smelly Adelaide suburb. In spite of a spirited
attempt to prove that the tragedy of Calvary, outside
Jerusalem, really took place on a Thursday, the Town
Town Council decided, by seven to five, not to let
the Oval for sports, as has usually been done. Then
one of the minority remarked that of course no club
whatever would be allowed to disport itself there’
The Mayor coldly replied that any motion to that
effect would be out of order, because the local Bowls
club has a proper lease of its corner of the Oval and
can do just as it D.W. pleases.
Beaurepaire, in Adelaide, had a round or
two with S.A. swimming records. It was no fight,
they being down and out from the call of Time. The
1000yds. of O. Dickmann, 14min. 7£sec., was moved
down to 13min 47sec., and Longworth’s mile (26min.
32sec.) was whittled down to 25min 45 3-10 sec.
~ Latest London papers have snapshots of
the Anglican bishop of that village in a tweed cap,
short coat, and the rest of the regulation costume,
playing golf with Or. W. G. Grace, the once-
renowned cricketer who brought a team to Australia
just 40 years ago. Bishop Winnington-Ingram rather
fancies himself as an all-round sportsman. On the
‘lay after the golf match he addressed a “social
purity meeting in London, and incidentally ob-
served that, at 55, he was “ready to take on anybody
present at any game they liked.” No takers—which
perhaps was not so much a tribute to the heftiness
of the Bishop as to the feeling that it would be un-
kind to damage a middle-aged prelate either in his
body or his feelings.
There was excitement in Sydney swim-
'jV/'S circles when the news flashed through that
Albert Barry (N.S.W.) had beaten Longworth for
the I°o yards swimming championship of Australia
at the Brisbane meeting. Then there was a painful
sensation when it became known that E. G. Finlay
of Westralia, had beaten Cecil Healy for third place’,
and actually headed Longworth himself for a space,
that was sensational enough for the ordinary man,
but there was more to follow—a heap more, in fact.
In the 1320 yards championship—the distance Long-
worth won his first championship over—he was the
first to touch the water, and got a magnificent start.
But \ n le e iffhth lap Queenslander Springfield, who
had been 30 yards behind, suddenly unwound a
sprint, overtook, and then, amidst thunderous ap-
p™e» actually headed the mighty Longworth. The
solia Government Dock tottered on its mortgage with
excitement. In the ninth lap Longworth overtook
the brilliant Queenslander, who was more or less
exhausted with his splendid dash, and finally won
by 15 yards. But it is the first time Longworth,
laving got to the front, has been headed. His time
was IBmin. 34 l-ssec., which does not compare with
, s , J ™ 111 ' 42sec. put up in Sydney Domain, Jan.
14, 1910. Longworth has evidently passed his zenith
and started on the precipitous track that will eventu-
ally bring him to his nadir.
The athletic championships of Australasia
attracted a couple of thousand enthusiasts to the
Amateur Sports Ground, Melbourne, last Saturday
afternoon. The competitors literally breathed hot
air; still, from a pedestrian point of view, a Mel-
bourne north wind is conducive to speed. Except
for Westralia, the Commonwealth and the Dominion
were well represented. South Aus. took a hand for
the first time at these meetings, which occur bi-
annually. Russell Watson (Vic.) accomplished the
star performance in the 4-mile. He did lmin.
56jsec., a wink outside his Australasian record, and
raced good men like Dormer (M.L.), Thorpe (N.S.W.)
and Power (U.S.A.) clean off their legs. Pickard,
the N.S.W. walker, covered the mile in 6min.
54 4-ssec., and beat Bill Murray (Vic.) all the
way. He walked faultlessly. G. L. Parker, the
Yankee sprinter, proved too strong a finisher for
Joe Burton (Vic.), so Joe was nearly a yard to the
bad in the 100yds., clocked in 10 l-ssee. All the
same, Parker doesn’t strike the writer as an ideal
sprinter. He amounts to a smaller edition of
Charlie Holway, the Yank pro., who got badly licked
by Jack Donaldson. Parker is a made runner, rather
than a natural one. Burton, by the way, lacks a
strong finish, but is the fastest amateur in Aus-
tralasia. Lester Kelly, the ex-Wesley Collegian,
defeated Jock Smith (N.S.W.) and Rick Templeton
(U.S.A.) in the tall jump. Kelly cleared the bar
at a shade under 6ft.. lin., and then went out and
won his heat in the quarter flat. Templeton did
sft. 11 Jin., and really provided the show. His
jumping is very spectacular—he really rolls over
the bar. E. R. Caughey, another of the Yankees, is
a small edition of Hackenschmidt. He lobbed the
161 b. shot 43ft. some 3ft. better than the
best Australian effort by D. McGrath (Q.). The
three miles running provided a real hard race
between Beatson (ML.) and O’Neill (Vic.). Beatson
is long and O’Neill is short. Time and again O’Neill
made efforts to gain the lead in the last mile, only
to be met with long, striding responses by Beatson.
In the last lap O’Neill tackled his opponent gamely
in the back stretch, but Beatson stalled off the chal-
lenge, and raced home strongly with a score yards
to the good. The crowd made a large noise over the
three miles, and threatened to lose its voice in its
efforts on behalf of O’Neill. The field was nowhere
in particular when the timekeepers said 15min.
52 2-sseo.
THE CHEERFUL GIVER.
The victorious American Saylor rejoices after
bestowing the order of the knock on Australia's
Hughie Mehegan at Sydney Stadium.
The Jokook Government, after all, stuck
to its guns, and ladled out £2OOO towards giving,
an Australian Rifle team a glorious time at Bisley,
England. At its best, the grant will provide a
slushy time for about 13 riflemen —three each from
N.S.W. and Victoria; two each from South Aus-
tralia and Queensland ; and one each from Westralia
and Tasmania; also a “commandant shooting cap-
tain.” This sort of tommyrot makes one tired and
partially dead. Considering the lack of target accom-
modation on which aspiring Australians can train
their eyes and their judgment to protect Australia,
Jokook and his gang are nothing less than a mob of
traitors, and if this were a wise community it would
pass a popular vote that they have mud thrown at
them on sight. All over Australia there is dearth
of shooting arrangements. There are thousands of
young men who would gladly take up. rifle shooting
as a pastime if they could get cheap rifles, cheap
ammunition and elbow room ; and, instead of meeting
them, Cook splashes £2OOO on an absurd show half
a globe away. Australia doesn’t want to produce the
best six or 12 marksmen in the Empire. It wants a
million Australian men and boys who can use the
rifle with sufficient skill to make invasion of our
continent too _ mad a dream to be considered. At
the present time our riflemen are a mere fraction
of our population.

Australia has no reason to be ashamed of
the team which will hold up its end of the log in
the Davis Cup scramble at the' other end of the
earth this year. Norman Brookes, W. F. Wilding,
A. W. Dunlop and S. N. Doust make a quartette that
any nation might be proud to own. If it goes down
it will be after a very bitter fight. The only dis-
quieting thought is, where are our champions of
to-morrow ?

It isn't all oysters and sparkling Bur-
gundy training on the Parramatta River for a scull-
ing match. There are sharks in the Parramatta—
hungry, protracted brutes which have neither fear
of God nor respect for man. Last week sculler
Fisher had a fight with a brother shark which
endeavored to upset the skiff so that he might know
“Billy” better. It was close to Gladesville Bridge,
but ihe sculler used an oar with great effect, and then
he made for the shore at full speed, with the shark
in close attendance. Had writer been William he
would have returned with a dynamite cartridge and
a sheep’s-pluck, and tried to do blue murder at the
fish’s expense.

The experiment of trying out the N.S.W.
country water-spaces for a gate was made at Lake
Herbert, Wagga, last week, when the budding scul-
lers, Paddy Hannan and Archie Priddle, went inland
with an array of followers. As a race, it was a very
sorry affair, Hannan winning bv about .20 lengths,
but the gate yielded £94—which is a lot more than
the fashionable Parramatta would have coughed up
for the occasion. In fact, it was so good that more
matches are likely to eventuate there, and one day
it will be a Wagga sculler who will win the world’s
championship, * and eclipse the fame of Wagga’s
famous butcher, Arthur Orton, alius Roger Tich-
borne, otherwise Thomas Castro.
f IS-F°°t Championship of Australia,
w “ lch ou t w ard and visible sign is the Mark
hoy Cup was contested at Perth (W.A.) last week
15 delightful weather and under ideal conditions.
Ar 6 » a , was represented by Chris Webb and
the Australian. Queensland had sent the dainty
vanity, in charge of skipper Spring, and Westralian
hopes were centred on Eurus and Westana, although
there were several others flying the standard of the
Black Swan Unfortunately, early in the contest
the mast of Eurus carried away, and after that it was
a duel between Australian and Vanity, the Westana
having no hope against them. Australian was easily
w*’* wiouing by 103 sec. from Vanity, which beat
Westana for second place by I9sec.

Sydney Summer baseball was strenuous
work in the fervent heat of last Saturday. Peter-
sham, with a weak team, went down to Waverley
13lue Sox by 12 to seven. It was only what was
expected. On second thoughts, it wasn’t. Nobody
dreamed the losers would put up seven. On the
other hand Waverley Red Sox had nary a hope
against Leichhardt, which led all the way. Waverley
bucked up astonishingly in the last two sessions, and
scored three. But it was too late; Leichhardt was
alieady five. All the same, it was a worse licking
than the scores make it appear.
“Captain Penfold” on Sunday hoisted
himself into the car of a balloon with a passenger.
Ihe balloon was anchored at Clifton Gardens, and
when a trial ascent was made it rolled horribly, and
the Captain decided to heave the passenger out for
his own safety, and go alone. The passenger left,
and at 4 p.m. the ropes were cut and the balloon
left also, bounding about 1500 ft. in the air. It
soared over the city, crossing Woolloomooloo and
Hyde Park, and sailing thence over Lane Cove River
and the Parramatta. It was 6000 ft. above the Lane
Cove River. Then it headed for Homebush, where
it passed over a train, and at 6.15 it was near
Liverpool, where Penfold decided to descend. When
he came down the balloon sought out a gum-tree.
To save the envelope from being damaged the
aeronaut scrambled out into the gum-tree, and let
the gasbag, now nearly deflated, drift away to slowly
settle in Macquarie Fields. Some local residents
helped the aeronaut from his ’possum perch. This
going up in ordinary balloons is a fool game. The
wind carried this aeronaut to Liverpool this time.
Next time he may find a strong breeze blowing sea-
ward * and may ride majestically towards Maoriland,
and find a school of sharks waiting for him when
he makes his duck into the Tasman Sea.

The Anniversary Meeting of the A.J.C. is
merely a cold collation on the Club’s annual menu
card. It began on Saturday afternoon and ended on
Monday evening. On Saturday honors were divided
between the public and Brian Mosenstein, the public
scoring in the Trial Stakes with Coradil, at seven
to four ‘on” ; the Centenary Stakes with Alured, at
nine to four “on,” and the January- Handicap with
Rue Victoria, at seven to four against. How these
punters do pay for their money! Mosenstein got
home in the First Nursery with Velours, which went
out at 14’s; with Golden Hop in the Challenge
Stakes, at 16’s, and Brunhilda and King Mostyn,
who dead-heated for the Welter. Brunhilda started
at 10 s and the King at 15’s. There was no fun off,
the two owners agreeing to divide the stake. The
gamble continued on Monday, in stifling heat, with
varying fortune. The public started well, loading
the coin on to Nuwera Eliya for the Flying Handi-
cap at threes, and raking in the boodle. This was
followed by Sir Bobadil, who started a hot pot at
two to one “on,” and arrived first in the Phillip
Stakes. The noisy person with the bag looked glum,
but smiled widely when the imported Danum, Which
went, out at 25’s, romped home in the Novice Handi-
cap. He fairly shrieked with merriment when Kil-
meadon another 25 to one chance, finished first in
the gilded Anniversary Handicap. The public had
backed Elystan at nine to two and Barlow at five to
one, and they were never in it. The Second Nursery
was a regular skinner, the winner being the 30 to
one Lord Linnet. The High Weight was a mixed
battle, the winner (Malthusian) carrying what money
the public had left at seven to four. Still, taking it
by and large, the public did better out of this side-
show meetin" than it has for many a day.
Owing to the Sheffield Shield match at
Sydney Cricket Ground between N.S.W. and Victoria
ordinary cricket was suspended. And well it might
be Great things were doing at the Cricket Ground.
Kelleway was hitting "up 138 for the Ma State, little
Macartney was smiting 201, and the common herd
were smacking 60’s. The first wicket seemed an
ironclad one, and 136 were pasted on the board
before it fell. The second was even worse, no less
than 357 being hoisted before the bails . flew to the
four winds. Thereafter the order was 416, 451, 495
5J5, 569, 605, 629 and 675. It looked appalling,
that vast score, 675, but the Victorians shut their
teeth grimly and went to work. They had no luck,
and by nightfall three wickets had fallen for 49
However, they were full of sand, and fought with
the fury of despair on Monday. Matthews produced
62. Armsttong plugged away stolidly till 87 were
on the board, and then Massie got him. But not
one of them onened his shoulders and took a des-
perate risk and battered up a hundred or two. It
Was all careful, stolid cricket, and the occasion
called for a man, or two men, who could go mad
like Maximilian Robespierre, and smash kingdoms.
As it was, the innings ended for 332, the bowling
honors falling to Massie (of the University) with six
wickets for 93 runs. Under the circs., of course,
Victoria followed on.
* * * *
“Blackbutt”: Hear me speak. Victorian
wicket-keeper Carkeek can still claim to be the
dandy Australian behind the sticks. In the turmoil
versus N.S.W. at Sydney, Carkeek stuck to the task
for Bhr. lOmin., during which time his errors,
failures, misfits, slumps, etc., added only six byes
to the Ma State total. The balance of the sundries
were made up of 13 leg-byes and one no-ball. It must
be admitted that Carkeek had no hurricane bowler
against him; but, all the same, his stamina seems
good enough to hold him in readiness for all the
work necessary in an Australian Eleven.
* * * *
Victorian colt Lampard got an adverse
christening against N.S.W. In 20 overs, Macartney
and co. banged 123 runs off him without losing a
wicket, after which Massie, very unkindly, bowled
him for the much dreaded “duck.” It was horrible
luck.
There are some charming expositions of
fisticuffs coming along at Sydney Stadium. This
Saturday should see what ought to prove a hefty
battle between Johnny Summers, who is a mighty
hitter before the gods, and the smashing Evernden
They are both full of sand, and there should be
some solid fighting before referee Scott hands over
the bav leaves and the diadem and the profits. But
g lea t fkrht as it may be, it will not rouse the excite-
ment that the meeting between Eddie McGoorty and
PatßnKneyw 1 ! 1 on February 7. That is the talk
ol the sporting world at present. Men chew over
the mention of it, and roll it round their mouths, as
an Inquisitor might chew the glad information of a
?/w h ® retic - B is generally argued that if
McGoorty approaches Bradley as he approached Smith,
he will meet a long good-night very suddenly. This
writer is ready to wager a bag of peanuts that
McGoortv won’t. On February 14 Johnny Summers
will crash into Matt Wells, and it is safe to bet
there will be a full house to watch the scrap. The
Saturday night afterwards Dave Smith will make an
effort to retrieve his pennon, against Jeff Smith, at
the same place. This confusion or disarrangement
of Smiths is perplexing. The name of the numerous
Smith gets mixed.
* * * *
The disadvantage that a short boxer with
a brief reach experiences when he is pitted against
a long man with an extended reach was made very
apparent when little Waldemar Holberg met English-
man Tom McCormick at Melbourne Stadium on
Saturday night. It was not much use Holberg lash-
ing out at McCormick’s head—-he couldn’t reach it,
anyhow, and Holberg wisely devoted a most affection-
ate care to Thomas’s midriff. But there he struck
trouble again. The long-range fists of McCormick
were falling like hail, disconcerting the plucky little
Dane, and destroying his aim, and, very naturally,
some of his blows went wild and landed below the
equator. The real trouble was, of course, that Mac’s
equator was so beastly high up. In the sixth round
a wild swing of Holberg’s landed low enough to do
damage and make things unpleasant, and the referee
banded McCormick the decision. Holberg’s luck is
simply putrid. Nobody who knows the Dane be-
lieves for a moment that he intentionally fouled
anybody in his life.

That large, fat man, Petty-Officer Curran,
whose Australian boxing career arrived at a sudden
and inglorious end, came a terrible cropper the other
day in Gay Paree, where he was up against the
hard-hitting Sam Langford. Samuel caught Curran
a real beauty on the face—exactly what part is not
known, for Samuel’s ham-like fist obliterated the
view of the whole Curran countenance area. “Nutty”
sank down on his knees with a sort of fizz, like the
last blow out of an exhausted soda-syphon, and stayed
on his marrow-bones till the count was put on him.
Then he got up and waddled round to the pay-office.
He was fighting exactly 17sec.
Yankee boxer Milburn Saylor and Hughie
Mehegan put up a big scrap at Sydney Stadium on
Saturday night for 11 rounds. Saylor is a hitter
of size, and the way he swings his fists all over the
place suggests that he is double-jointed. Also, his
reach is as long as from here to yonder. He would
have been a formidable opponent for Mehegan even
when at his best, and just now our Hughie is not
what he used to be. He has not deteriorated physi-
cally. He can hit as hard as ever he did. His
trouble is that he has lost the instinct to hit. He
spent valuable seconds working Saylor into a recep-
tive attitude, and then either failed to smite or
smote when it was too late. Saylor, on the other
hand, bashed all the time. He bashed instinctively,
by reflex action of the brain and without thinking,
whereas Mehegan had to think to hit first, and he
..was often buried in meditation tod long. But it
must not be imagined that Saylor escaped scathless.
Mehegan got there a great deal more than once. In
fact, for the first four rounds he had easily the best
of it, but. after that he waned, while Sayior seemed
to wax mightier. Again and again he beat Mehegan
off, and with his reach he was always master of the
long-range fighting. Only once was he in dire
danger—in the ninth, when Hughie worked him into
a corner and let go a right and left battery that was
laden with sudden death. But Saylor knew it, and
ducked and dodged and danced and fled here and
there and escaped. After that he was cautious for a
while. But half-way through the eleventh a wild
right swing crashed into Mehegan’s ribs, and the Aus-
tralian staggered. Quick as a flash Saylor hurled his
left at the jaw. Mehegan saw it coming, but didn’t
leave in time. He went down, but with a roll over
struggled up again and covered his jaw. A shower
of assault and battery floored him once more, and
then the audience gasped at an exhibition of unequal-
led determination. Mehegan crawled along the floor
on all fours, seized the ropes and hauling himself up
by them once more faced the conflict, amidst the
maddest cheering that ever shook the Stadium. Not
only did he face the blizzard ; he made to attack.
But he was done. Someone said to Duke Mullins to
throw in the towel. “He’d kill me if I did,”
lamented the big trainer. Done as he was, he strove
to guard and duck, but nothing could save him, and
again he was sent down, utterly out.
Seen after the fight Mehegan was found to be quite
unmarked. He took his defeat as he has taken all
his wins, philosophically. “It has to come sooner or
later—-but, all the same, it hurts when it actually
arrives. _ Yes, I saw that wallop coming, but I could
do nothing. No, I don’t remember climbing up the
ropes. I hope I made a decent battle, that’s all.
After all, it’s the way a man goes down more than
the fact that he does that matters. I don’t seem to
be able to hit as quickly. Before I went to England
my fists shot out of their own accord ; now I have to
make them shoot, and it’s a big difference.” “You
want good holiday in the country, perhaps!” said

WHY DON’T YOU LEARN
TO USE YOUR HANDS?
V.
You fully realise the importance of know-
ing how to defend yourself. Because self-
preservation is part and parcel of every form
of life.
You ought to do something to develop your
natural power. Why not learn to box —learn
to use your hands to the best advantage ?
Otherwise the time will surely come when
you will bitterly repent your indecision.
Perhaps it may be a matter of life and
death, then —you’ll wish in vain.
There’s no excuse for you not knowing how
to box. I can teach you in your own home.
I TEAGH BOXING
BY POST.
I thoroughly explain the most serviceable
moves known to Ringcraft. The best moves
of the most famous living boxers will form
part of your instruction. If you were
entangled in a mix-up, what a big advantage
you’d have—what confidence you’d have, and
that’s half the battle. Here is a letter from
one pupil:—
“I am getting along splendidly with
my boxing. I am beginning to feel sure
of myself. It is a grand pastime.”
H.E.W., Nimbin, N.S.W.
See how he’s building up confidence, because he knows how. You ought to learn “how” too.
Write for my 32-page booklet, “Scientific Boxing in Your Home,” which describes my methods, and
gives cost of tuition. It’s worth having. Send three penny stamps for postage.

“Celia Lloyd.”: A few weeks ago a Syd-
ney newspaper made the discovery that arms
were being smuggled into the Solomon
Islands. Which news is only 15 years old.
Anyhow, 12 years ago, when Black Brother
was holding up the big end of the Queens-
laid sugar industry. I accompanied an offi-
cial aboard the blackbirder Lochiel, just ar-
rived at the Solomons from Queensland
with returned labor, and watched him and
his black police go through those nigs’ gear
like a flash of lightning through a wire
fence. Boxes of trade tobacco, when broken
open, yielded anything up to a hundred
cartridges; bags of rice, when probed, ex-
posed a Snider carbine (in two pieces) ;
and even the water tanks below decks were
dragged with great success. A Malaita boy
fishing over the side had his line hauled up
by a black policeman. The catch was a
YVinchester rifle. The lone fisherman was
handed six months’ quod as a reward. While
the search was going ahead, a boat came
alongside from the mission vessel Southern
Cross, which was lying not far away, for
two Christian women, who were going to
the mission station. Their gear was duly
searched and handed over the side, but, as
the boat' left us, one of the black police
expressed some blushful suspicions. We
followed the ladies aboard the holy vessel,
and quite shocked the disciple in charge by
ordering one to peel off. The shock was a
double-headed one, on the discovery that she
had about 200 cartridges stitched into the
things discarded since the tango and other
dances came into fashion.

“J.F.H.” (London) : A brisk agitation has been
started here against animal performances in the ’alls.
An evening paper, the Globe, has taken on the job,
and is chin-deep in correspondence, alleging that gross
cruelties are practised by the trainers, mostly foreign-
ers. Lady Irving, widow of Sir Henry, has been
making inquiries, and has published a “Plea for the
Dumb and t Defenceless.” She dilates on the “hidden
evils and horrors which taint the stage lives of these
unfortunate animals.” Many of them, she declares,
die under the chastisement they receive and the seve-
rity of the strain of learning and -successfully, going
through the tricks they have to perform. The smiling
presenters of these animal acts are frequently guilty
of “the most atrocious cruelties” behind the curtain.
After they have done their turns the animals are
“hidden away in dark places underneath the stage,
often in small, narrow cages, where they lead a
miserable, pining existence.” The lady sums up,
truly enough, that the animals’ tricks are, as a rule,
“quite contrary to their ordinary nature, frequently
risky, or so pitifully fatuous as to make the angels
weep.” But the manager’s troubles about the angels’
tears so long as they get the gods’ cheers.
From the New York Morning Telegraph
(9/11/’l3) :
TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN.
Some five years ago I conceived two ideas for sen-
sational Pantomimic Dances, one having for a finish
a lady representing a spider and dancing, etc., on a
huge web. On the advice of friends to whom 1 told
the idea I wrote it out in detail, describing Plot,
Costume, Scenery, etc., and posted it in a registered
letter (three years ago) addressed to myself, which
letter I hold unopened. This statement is not made
in any aggressive spirit, but simply to avoid con-
troversy should I care to exploit my idea.
(Signed) CECILE, of Cecile, Eldred & Carr,
Sensational Novelty Creator,
Per Address No. 221 W. 42d St., New York City.
Since Cecile conceived her idea, and was rash enough
to confide it to her friends, it has been exploited
successfully in England; and, as danced by Ivy
Schilling and Fred Leslie, it is now about the most
. attractive feature of the Australianised version of
“Come Over Here.” Owing to the rotten state of the
Copyright Law, as between the U.S. and the rest of
the world, the inventor of this profitable novelty has
no legal redress in the matter. As a matter of fact,
the whole question of international copyright needs
a sort of general overhaul. Nothing is surer in the
world of vaudeville than that, if one performer gets
a bright idea, in the way of stage business or what
not, a horde of slavish imitators will swiftly adopt
it. Bert Levy, for example, began drawing to gags
and music, on a contrivance which reflected his work
in a magnified form on a screen. There must be
dozens of shameless stealers of his idea operating in
different parts of the world at the present time.
Cinquevalli, Chung Ling Soo, Harry Lauder, George
Robey and a thousand others have had their
particular notions similarly pirated—also most of
them have pirated other people’s notions in their
time, no doubt. Ethically the system is indefensible.
If a person embezzles in London he may be arrested
and extradited in New York; and vice versa. Why
should a man be leapt on, by International Law, for
stealing money, and given free rein to steal money’s
worth in the shape of stage novelties, business, ideas
and so forth? The thing is 'insanely illogical.
Furthermore, it is responsible for much of the. deadly
monotony which distinguishes the world of vaude-
ville. Artists will not risk problematically successful
new ideas when they can employ old ones that have
already gone well; and t hey Will not go to the
trouble of thinking out attractive turns when they
can collar them from others, without the necessity
of any mental strain. Far the most equitable Copy-
right ‘ Act is that which the Australian Parliament
adopted the year before last. Under it the mere fact
of writing a work for the’stage—whether a drama, or
a ballet, or a musical comedy, or a cinema plot—
gives the author copyright in it; and that copyright
extends not only to the dialogue and scenario, but to
every bit of stage business that has been expressed
in writing. If such an Act were international, instead
of being merely Australian, Cecile would be entitled
to redress from all those who have used her ballet
idea. As it is, she has no hope of extracting a
farthing from anyone, except as a matter of charity.
The London and other firms who are exploiting her
creation are acting strictly “Within the Law.”
THE UNDERTAKER AND THE DRAMA.
[For The Bulletin.]
Quoth the undertaker, Mr. Plant,
“Look at a play I simply can’t!”
The managers theatrical
Can never stage a funeral!
They skite about realistic scenes,
But they don’t know what an interment means.
“And why should 1 patronise the play?
The hide-bound dramatist of to-day
At burial scenes too long has sniffed —
He never gifes my biz a lift.!
lie kills his characters off with ease,
But he lets us guess at their obsequies!
“The last occasion I saw a show
To Shakspeare’s ‘Hamlet’ I thought I’d go.
Of dramatists' he may be best,
But he makes his bloomers like the rest!
That night my faith in the Bard was bust,
At one of the scenes I simply cussed!
“I allude to the burial ceremonee
Of the girl who committed felo-de-se,
The way it was staged gave me the .pip—
The grave-digger got not a single tig!
And that is why,” said Mr. Plant,
“Go to the play I simply can’t!”
Victoria, EARDLEY TURNER.
THE WOWSER’S PRATER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Speaking at Parkville the Rev. Frank Milne said
that the level of public entertainment in Australia
was sinking. It now seemed to consist largely of
lascivious dancing, mixed bathing, mixed camping
and ragtime competitions. AVhat was the cause of
this? It seemed to him that it was throug'i material
well-being—the blight of prosperity. “If this is so,”
said Mr. Milne, “I say with all sincerity, may the
year we are entering upon be a year of drought and
sore famine—may God take away this material well-
being.”—Melb. Press.
Since sinfulness in all its forms
Is rife throughout the land,
Arise in wrath, 0 Lord of Hosts —
Strike with Thy awful hand !
Grim pestilence and fell disease,
With ev’ry sore mischance
Is meet for those who bunny hug
And do the Tango dance.
Who to a boxing match repairs,
Or camps beside the sea,
In decent sight is damned ; so shall
He not be damned by Thee?
The plagues that troubled ancient Job
Call down on all who go
To ragtime competitions or
The sinfid picture show !
For those who take an hour’s delight
In Lathing in the blue,
AVhat sore affliction is there left?
What punishment will do?
That which they sin in—water —they
Will have to do without!
Grant, Thou, an earnest Christian’s pray’r:
Send us, 0 Lord, a drought!
VICTORIA.

THE LAST WORD
IN
MODERN SUPERHEATED STEAM ENGINE CONSTRUCTION
An regard to durability, reliability, steady running
and adaptability, Wolf Superheated Steam Locomo-
biles at least equal the best steam engine or turbine
plants of several 1000-h.p.
Their superiority in economy is attained by their
faultless construction, and in obviating the many
losses, including radiation, etc., which are’ unavoid-
able in steam plants having separate boiler and
engine.
Over Suction Gas Plants, Oil and Gas Engines, Wolf
Locomobiles possess the following advantages:—
Cheaper cost of fuel; great reserve of power, allow-
ing overloads up to 50 per cent.; steadiness in run-
ning under extreme and sudden variation of load; use
of any kind of fuel besides coal; utilisation of steam
for heating or manufacturing purposes; easy attend-
ance, even by unskilled hands; Absolute Reliability
and Greater Durability; greater simplicity and con-
tinuously maintained economy also at lower loads.

The Cow is almost as conspicuous a figure
as the mere human female in Maoriland
matrimonial advts. For instance, these con-
secutive two from a recent Gisborne paper:—
ENGLISHMAN (26) wishes to correspond with
Maori Lady, with dairy farm, view to Matrimony.—
, Office.
YOUNG AMERICAN wishes to meet two or three
Maori Ladies (with or without dairy farms), view to
Matrimony. Kiatere teutu mai kitenei panui. .
Which last being interpreted means, “Here,
you, hustle along, for lam the goods.” And
note the American’s own hustle—one Maori
lady for the mere Englishman ; two or three,
if you please, for the ’Murikan gent.
The wail of the Wowser has been ascend-
ing to the stars at Wellington (M.L.) be-
cause surfers thereabouts have been appear-
ing in “neck-to-knee” costumes that come
no lower than half-way between hip and
knee. The Rev. Willum Wowser alleges for
the prosecution that dimpled knees are a
snare compared with which Old Nick is a
Sunday-school teacher. The. City Council
has been exhorted from 40 pulpits to take
action; but so far the only benefit accruing
from the crusade is a renewed interest in
the study of knees by the youth of Welling-
ton, who now flock out to the seaside in
large numbers to learn what all the row’s
about and to see what they’ve been missing.
“Aedile” : For many months every year the
average Australian country township is
cursed with a plague of flies. It is often
pitiful to see children sitting about in the sun
like lizards with their eyes full of the, in-
sects. Now that we know the fly as the
most leprous brute in nature, the champion
disseminator of typhoid, ophthalmia, an-
thrax nnd other horrors, a defiler and infec-
tor of. food, something ought to be done
about it. The very, verv gradual N.S.W.
Board of Health has limited its efforts to
issuing a pamphlet containing many obvious
things which everyone knows, and many
counsels of perfection. In Queensland fly-
killing campaigns are officially recommended,
as in S’Africa and some of the American
States,; and this, no doubt, destroys many
millions of the little winged devils. But
an authority on the subject, Dr. Hewitt,
of Canada, who investigated the efficacy of
this system, has embodied the results in
this very remarkable and discouraging state-
ment :
In no case did the total number of flies killed in
the whole of a campaign exceed the quantity which
could easily be reared under natural conditions from
an average-sized pile of stable refuse in the course
of a few weeks.
In Canada the campaign is therefore now
directed against the fly’s breeding places:
the scavenging department forces those re-
sponsible for garbage heaps to remove them.
Ordinance 39 under the Local Government
Act of N.S.W. provides that premises con-
taining horse yards, cow yards, stables or
cattle sheds shall put all refuse (not re-
moved immediately) in a bin and keep the
bin covered and emptied and have it
cleansed once a week or oftener if necessary.
But this wholesome ordinance is enforced
in very few country towns. Hence the
myriads of flies in the Australian summer,
loathsome creatures crawling over and poi-
soning uncovered food, and clinging to the
eyes and ears. The danger of the fly ought
to be taught in all schools, and Boards of
Health and municipal and shire councillors
should have elementary lessons in the same
subject for their own special benefit.
When the boozer and the anchorite com-
bine, who shall resist them? Canon Charl-
ton, of Sydney, has now joined the army of
decent drinkers who advocate that on
Christmas Day the bars of N.S.W. should
be either open in the full sense of the word
or altogether closed. The Canon, who walks
about with his eyes open, saw a crowd of
men sitting on the kerbstone outside a pub,
each one taking an observation of the home
of his father in heaven through the butt-end
of a beer bottle. He regarded it as degx-ading
and foolish on the general principle that if
it is right to sell a man grog on
Christmas Day, then it is right to let him
imbibe it decently and in private. An
equally idiotic spectacle, though the Canon
overlooked it, is that of a line of waiters
streaming between any big unlicensed
restaurant apd the nearest pub. The ser-
vitors go empty-handed, and return heavily
laden with beer, whisky and champagne.
What advantage is there to anyone in this
unseemly spectacle? It doesn’t cause a dimi-
nution in the pastime of inebriety. It
doesn’t lessen the profits of the publican or
restaurateur. The only effects are to give a
lot of harassed waiters sore feet; to keep
the restaurant patrons waiting for their
liquor, with the result that they become
thirstier than they would have been other-
wise and proportionately more liable to get
drunk; and to cause the public to be fleeced
both of the innkeeper’s profit on the drink
and the eating-shop’s commission for sending
for it. As it is palpably impossible to
banish the nation’s thirst by Act of Parlia-
ment it seems _ a reasonable thing to argue
that the thirst in question should be quenched
in comfort and seclusion.
King George, it is said, has definitely de-
cided to add a Court newsagent to his staff.
Not a mere puff paragraphist for the pro-
moting of loyalty among the masses, but a
hard, unimaginative official “whose sole
duty it shall be to issue information to the
press concerning matters of general interest
respecting the Royal family as a whole.”
This momentous decision was hastened by
a recent canard which caused great annoy-
ance, to their Majesties. The Duchess of
Connaught was alleged, by the English-
speaking press throughout the world, to
have been taken seriously ill, when, as a
matter of fact, she was eating, drinking
and sleeping her very best. The false rumor
was due to her having been visited, quite
casually, by the surgeon who attended her
some time ago, and who called to rejoice in
the continuance of, her Highness’s complete
recovery. The rumor of a quite-well Prin-
cess being very sick was naturally distressing
to King George and' his Queen. They
reckoned that millions of loyal subjects
were being unnecessarily alarmed. Hence
the appointment of a Court newsagent who
will supply authorised information to the
newspapers.. Any paper that publishes un-
authorised items of news—such as a car-
buncle on the neck of a Serene Highness
who is really suffering only from a large
pimple on the shoulder-blade-—will be
denied any further supply of facts from the
Court agent. All the other papers will pub-
lish the same thrilling facts on the same
day, and the nublic will know that it is
getting the authorised edition.

IN BANANA LAND
“Gee Up” hopes for the best:—
The Bulletin observed the other day that the
present Queensland Government “appears to have
made a point of pushing up younger men.” Writer
who some years ago was pushed clean up and out
of the service by practically the same crowd, on the
grounds that his pay of £l9O a year was urgently
needed to save “the best State of them all” from
financial disaster, hopes the statement has a lot of
truth in it. He also hopes that the present Govern-
ment is about to establish a precedent by pushing
up some bf the older men—some of those who don’t
usually sleep with hymn-books for pillows, and are
not known in the Uppah Suckle or in influential
clubs and lodges. Writer himself, being born 40
years ago about as poor as it was possible for an
Australian bush-kid to be, never pursued the Uppah
Suckle. He never became a lodge man, a 'club
man or a great churchman. Consequently when
Morgan and Ividston (both now in good permanent
jobs) and Jimmy Everything Blair (who shed many
hot tears because he didn’t also get his permanent
job) declared for a Black Wednesday, this scribe,
like Wolsey, was left naked to his confounded
enemies.
Bung is no hand at strike-fighting. Out
of half a dozen beer strikes in the last 18
months he has not secured a single win,
owing principally to non-union beer labor.
Curiously enough even virulent unionists
whoop for the “scab” if it means cheap beer.
“Rangan” : The climate of the North soon
takes it out of the navvies. Sixty years ago
one Austin Droney began swinging a pick
for a crust, and he can still be seen any day
helping to level the track for the North
Coast railway north of Rockhampton. He
navvied on the first Bana,naland line from
Brisbane to Ipswich over half a century ago,
and has been turning a humble sod in the
deadly State ever since.
Inspector-General Roe (M.A. of Oxford)
follows up Governor Macgregor’s commen-
dation of Latin and Greek with a healthy
curse. Speaking as one who started life
with 10 years of Latin and Greek verse-
making, and then put in six years at Oxford,
he wants to know why boys should be learn-
ing endless rules about the Latin subjunctive
and Greek optative when in English we ex-
press all shades of meaning admirably with-
out any subjunctive at all. British school-
masters, “to produce a few scholars able to
appreciate the classics of Greece and Rome

have sacrificed everybody else and have con-
demned large sections of society to remain
uneducated,” and he characterises the system
as ridiculous when it isn’t worse. So does
every practical man ; but it isn’t often one
of Roe’s academic standing has the courage
to say so.
“Platman’s” send-off:—
“Dismissed” the other day at Charters Towers, Pat
Foy, one of the oldest scholars of the old school.
He was among the first on the field, and was a work-
ing shareholder in the Queenslander, the first mine
there to employ steam power for hauling. From the
start he was a leader in the Northern democratic
movement, and was the founder of the “Republican”
Association. In the prime of life he lost an arm in
the mines, and when later on denouncing the restric-
tive franchise which made an unimproved allotment
of more importance than a wandering prospector,
Patrick Foy looked like an elderly Michael Davitt.
There were some keen intellects in the Towers in
those days, and the best of them devoted their talent
to pushing the young and promising men to the
front. Hence the rise of Andy Dawson and Joe
Lesina —though in point of knowledge men greatly
their superiors could be found in the rank and file.
There was, for instance, Joe Dillon—poet and states-
man. Miners’ phthisis gripped him and he died
a comparatively young man; but for the three or
four years he lingered, his little shop next the Union
Hall was generally thronged with those who delighted
in his flowing periods and his sound common-sense.
The Union Hall was the publishing office of the Eagle
when that bird had a shriek—when Yosper’s pen yelled
for “Blood or Bread” and Lesina wrote fiery articles,
or miscopied still more fiery ones and heaped on the
paper a horrible load of libel costs. The Union Hall
is now a mere shack; the Eagle is plucked and
trussed; and the Republicans—well, some of them
have met a worse fate and have turned Tory.
Virile!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Department wants to see a strong, healthy,
virile type of woman to keep up the pioneer tradi-
tions.—Under,-Sec. Story, addressing lady teachers.
We’re tired of Tot and Flossie, with their
pretty, mincing ways;
AVe’ve had enough of Hilda, with her playful
kitten craze;
’Tis time with all their bag of tricks they
rested on the shelf,
Like the charmer of the ’so’s who was
Prud’ry’s other self;
And all the plotters feminine who bag a silly
prey
With skirts that slit and blouses scant will
shortly pass away,
And when they’ve left the platform clear
with all their foolish clan,
We hope to get the woman wfio knows how
to be a man!
No more her voice shall hail us with a giggle
sweet and shrill.
No more shall we regard her as a Creature
with a bill;
No more with creams and chocolates we’ll
stop her pretty mouth,
And strive with cunning ices to allay her,
summer drouth ;
No more with paint and powder will she sally
forth to charm,
And hope, with soft, beseeching eyes, you’ll
keep her safe from harm.
The while with aim piratical her glances
rove and scan
The ranks of male creation with intent to
catch a qjan.
We want to see her wander forth in dense
and manly boots;
We pine to see her run her car with moni-
tory hoots ;
We yearn to see her drop high heels and
spurn her pointed toes,
And cease to glance behind to see who
watches how she goes ;
If only she would laugh “Ha! Ha!” and
poke us in the ribs
And lay the odds and shout a beer and
fashion fishing fibs.
And rush to rake the dollars in from Beer-
sheba to Dan —
Oh ! Trot along the woman who knows how
to be a man !
Why should we have to smirk and smile and
lift our ancient hat
Because Belinda’s passing who’s a patent
female flat?
Why should we prose and poetise about her
Mission High,
The while we know she only broods on what
your purse can buy?
’Twould surely be far better if we dropped
this silly cant
That makes of man a hypocrite, of her a
sycophant;
We want no titt’ring fool-trap with her
graces and her fan —
We pine to clutch the woman who knows
how to be a man!
The girl of old at heart was gold (we
wouldn’t do her wrong),
But (bless that heart!) she played her part
at times a trifle strong;
The graceful, willowy damsel was a darling
in her way;
But be who stood the racket had the devil’s
bill to pay;
So having tried the various brands of bottled
female stuff.
The modern male, a trifle pale, cries “Ladies,
dear, enough !
We’d like to range around and change the
bev’raee. if we can,
So trot along the woman who knows how to
be a man !”
QUEENSLAND.
PHILANDER F.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, January 24, 1914.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
An English paper recently mentioned that
Archbishop Donaldson had been offered a
billet in the Cold Country, whereupon a
chorus of synodsmen broke into noisy assur-
ances that his Leggings would never desert
Mr. Micawber, or the Mothers’ Union or
something. However, their lamentations
were stilled by a cable denying everything,
or so much of everything as was necessary.
Will J. Sowden, of the Adelaide Regis-
ter, fetched up at this city on Monday last,
and departed again on Wednesday. On
Tuesday he was fed at Finney’s roof-garden
cafe by the Wattle Day Leaguers, and on
the same date he lunched several pressmen
at his hotel. Just to show that there was
no class prejudice in his composition, he
shook hands with the Governor prior to leav-
ing the place. He left the place. He didn’t
put it in his carpet-bag ana. take it away
with him.
The William Ilalls .celebrated their dia-
mond wedding this week. They are old
pioneers, and still quite lively, in spite of
their years. George Hall, a brother, was
years ago on the Courier, and afterwards
edited the Telegraph. That, of course, has
nothing to do with William Hall. It is
just thrown in to show you what, but for
the grace of Providence, he might have come
to.
Novelist Beatrice Grimshaw is here at
present. She has been gathering up
useful scraps of information in the
Celebes, Borneo and German Papua.
Beatrice can swim and shoot, and
isn’t afraid of going on an expedition with
a bunch of partially unadorned cannibals.
Incidentally, she doesn’t want a vote, and
knows how to dress. No woman novelist
could be better equipped unless she is anxious
for enormous sales. In that case she should
assimilate much bedroom information, and
wrap it up for the eager multitude of sub-
urban flappers and hurried housemaids.
Miss Tighe returned this week, after flying
over England, Continental Europe and India.
I don’t mean, my dear, that the lady actu-
ally flew with her own wings, because she
isn’t even suspected of having such things.
Not that there is any reason why she
shouldn’t have them, but—oh, you know
what I mean. She’s one of us, and flies
merely by aeroplane.
Another popular lady who hopped in this
week, .is Mrs. W. S. Byrne, known as
“Auntie” to most of the younger set. She
has been touring the cold countries for over
a year. When she got into her pretty little
home at New Farm, after leaving the Om-
rah, she found the place bursting with boxes
of flowers, while a heap of good wishes ex-
ploded on the front mat. The wharf was
distended with her friends, so that things
generally were crowded.
Mrs. William Thorne was the victim of a
surprise sortie one day this week. The
guests charged, took possession of her house
and retreated again, leaving a wristlet watch
and a few other things as souvenirs of the
occupation. It was the most peaceful in-
vasion in history.
Pianist Hilda Roberts was married in
your city on Tuesday to Charles Pressdee,
and is at present ’mooning in the Blue Hills,
which call themselves Mountains, but are
not. We have bigger mountains here, but
we don’t talk about them- —-except that I am
talking about them now.
Two murders and one suicide have helped
to give the daily newspapers circulation
thrills this week. The suiciiie was a girl of
18. The other morning her mother went to
call her at three o’clock, to begin her day’s
work, which was connected with the inevit-
able and accursed cow —delivering the brute’s
juice, to be exact. Possibly the misery of
rising before dawn to dispense cow essence
for years had been too much for the girl.
Anyhow, she recorded the Last Protest in a
brief note explaining where her dead body
might be found. It was there.
This afternoon 3000 persons sat round the
so-called dry docks, which were full of
water, and watched the inter-State swim-
ming. So that there should be no shortage
of fluid it rained a good deal. The exhibi-
tion was entertaining and instructive, and
no entertainment can be more without bor-
ing the onlookers.
Stan Doust, the -tennis personage, paid a
flying visit to our proud metropolis during
the week. I hasten to tell you this, Thar-
gomindah, feeling sure that you have been
spending sleepless nights wondering where
he had got to.
In my official despatch of January 15, I
credited solicitor W. J. Byram with being
the father of the handsome bud Marjorie of
that ilk. As a matter of fact, the lucky
father is 11. W. Byram, a cousin of W. J.
The latter is a mere bachelor.
The widow of Joshua Bell, now resting in
the Toowong cemetery beside her husband
and son, was a noted beauty in her day, and
the Bell home at Jimbour, over which she
ruled, was the centre of hospitality unex-
ampled in pastoral Queensland. The sorry
side of her life began with the sudden death
of her knighted Joshua, amidst the jingle of
affluence; then came the bank smashes of
20 years ago, the loss of properties, the
trials of many years when circumstances
had vastly changed, the death of her son
after he had begun to make a mark in the
public life of the country, and the last years
of her life spent in humble surroundings,
with the end at last in a little cottage at
the West End of Brisbane. There was no
pageant at the funeral —nothing but a very
small group of friends to help turn over the
last page.
Yours in a chastened spirit,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
Bananaland’s neglected teachers are at last
promised a course of training—or at least
some of them are. Previous to the advent
of the University, the teachers were recruited
from schoolboys, given a little extra coaching,
and then allowed to struggle on as best they
could, with the result that, when they grew
old enough to look around, they frequently
said good-bye to the department and went on
the land or elsewhere —generally elsewhere.
A degree in the service was almost unknown.
Now a few teachers’ scholarships have been
given to the University, and the winners,
besides being schooled for a degree, will re-
ceive a course in teaching. Shirley, late
senior-inspector of schools, will have charge of
this branch of the business.
Queensland has now a bigger German
population than any other Australian State,
not even excepting South Aus. Many of the
Teutons are settled in the Logan district,
where they or their immediate forebears were
dumped 50 years ago from the old Susannah
Godefroi. A fine, tough, much-enduring
crew they were, who battled through un-
speakable hardships and won a well-deserved
prosperity. Schneider, now a grizzled vet-
eran, headed the first band and preached to
them 50 years ago under a stately gum, and
the same Schneider is to-day a church-warden
by no means weary of office or existence.
Queensland sugar-mills have now about
completed their returns, and the output is
found to easily beat even the estimate. The
total production was between 242,000 and
243,000 tons; and in all the past years of
the industry the gaudiest previous flgures
were 210.765 tons. Mackay was the star
district: it manufactured 57,000 tons, worth
about £750,000, or 5000 tons better than
the previous best, which Tommy Tanna
helped to harvest away back in 1900. The
Mackay crop is reckoned the best and most
profitable ever harvested in any district in
Australia since the job of growing sugar
was first tackled.

Motorists desirous of having larger tyres fitted to their standard rims without going to the
expense of, or being inconvenienced by, the re-building of their wheels, cannot do better than
fit CONTINENTAL “OVERSIZE” TYRES. The many advantages of “Oversizes”
has become apparent to thousands of Australian Motorists, who recognise that the increased
air capacity must necessarily add to the tyre mileage and incidentally reduce vibration, and
—most important of all —a big Decrease in their Tyre Bill.

Teething
troubles
—with the accompanying
inflammation, restlessness,
irritability, broken sleep,
and swelling of the gums—
can be overcome. SCOTT’S
Emulsion gives the extra
strength the child needs,
and aids the easy develop-
ment of strong, firm, white
teeth.
“My son, suffering with whooping
cough and teething, was wretchedly
thin and weak. After taking SCOTT’S
the whooping cough is quite cured, he
is cutting his teeth without any trouble
and looks quite strong and robust.” —

Timber Getter: You say it costs as much
or more to shift a cargo of timber from Cairns to
Sydney or from northern N.S.W. to “southern ports,”
as it -does to bring the same sort of goods from
Vladisvostock or Norway. Well, in the first place,
the cost of loading and unloading is the same
whether the voyage is long or short. Then
supposing your figures are correct, are you
prepared to fell and load timber at Norwegian
or Siberian rates? Are you prepared to build and
man ships at these rates? Are you prepared to dig
out fuel to propel the ships at these rates? Also,
how much timber comes here from Vladivostock, and
what really is the freight charge ?.... Mello: We
have as much objection to imported experts as you
have, but Swinburne’s statement that “wireless” will
presently cover Australia, and that the existing
telegraphs will “fall into disuse,” looks dead cer-
tain, all the same. Wherefore it is time to pay off
the money borrowed for these soon-to-be-superannuated
telegraphs. The dead horse is a dreadful thing tc
have lying about in hot weather.... Gordon G.: No
luck with this lot. . . .A. Blank: Too vague an
accusation. .. .J.W.A.: Too wordy. Give us the meat
extract; keep the bones and the hide and the horns
and the gristle. .. .Glad Tidings: Come home. All
is forgiven.... La Plume: The verse has as many
bumps in it as a journey by a pack camel....
James Webb: (1) In the matter of what you call
“clean politicks” the other crowd could hardly
have done worse than the present push, which
turned dog so shamelessly on its honest finance
policy, reduction of borrowing policy, sinking fund
policy, decentralisation policy and State ownership
of land policy—also the push which sent a danger-
ous critic abroad to inquire into any old thing with
full salary and £4 a day for “expenses,” and which
introduced an Income-tax Bill under which the small
Australian manufacturer was taxed much more heav-
ily than the absentee landlord. (2) You ask: “How
much land is there at Port Stephens not owned by
the Port Stephens Co. ?” Presumably you regard
that as a crusher in the matter of The Bulletin’s
proposed new State-owned city there. Well, we
don’t know, and don’t care. You are surely aware
that Parliament has power to resume land at its
present value (just as it did for its new Sydney
railway station), and present values at Port Ste-
phens aren’t high. So that rooster, regarded as an
excuse for the Ilolman Government’s backdown on
decentralisation, won’t fight. (3) Incidentally, if you
don’t turn out a very bad Ministry till you are
quite sure that the next one will be better, the very
bad Ministry will remain in for ever, and do every
kind of misdeed with impunity. For no one can
tell how the next Ministry may fall away from its
alleged principles. After the falling away of the
present lot, anythine- seems possible. .. .Jobber:
would gladly publish your letter if it were vigorous
enough, but it hardly stirs a hair. The spirit is
willing, but the cuss is weak.—Hilda H.: The
Religious Editor at once hurried out and drank your
health. . . .Edward 11. (V.) ; You haven’t a writer’s
equipment. .. .Bill D.: Bill, you had better throw
your coils round a les» religious print. . . .Bellerive:
A poem without a fatality:—-
A STORMY NIGHT.
Around a lighthouse the winds
Did shriek and Wail
The wild sea was lashed by
A sweeping gale
The house shook and the
Tower rocked to and fro
As the huge waves dashed
And the winds did blow
While through the darkness shone
Out its gleaming light
To guide ships from the rocks
That fearful night
The storm prevailed upon
The mighty deep
And died away when the streaks
Of dawn did peep.
. ...C.C.D.: “Secret” is a damp rocket....W. McK.
(Neutral Bay) : That Maori yarn was recently printed
in The Bulletin. .. . A.A.H.: Much too dry..,.
Breakers: Bit labored.... Scab: Dull enough for the
basket. .. .Jack B. (M.L.) : Too windy.... New
Zealander: So far as we know, there is no
Alick in the poem. Lots of people have been
claiming A.L.G. as their friend and immortaliser.
You can get the facts from “Adam Lindsay Gordon
and his Friends in England and Australia,” by Edith
Humphris and Douglas Sladen. Any bookseller
should procure it for y0u....J.F. (Brisbane): Un-
suitable. .. .Talia: Too slight.... Kharlofa: Ram-
shackle sort of thing. .. .Ecnirp: Where’s your sense
of humor?... .W.X.R.: You yearn in spasms....
J.P. (M.L.) : Do us a favor; don’t send us any
more —we’ve had all we want... . J.G.A.: He isn’t an
Australian type. .. .0 C.: Don’t care for that sort
of story. 1 Never heard two real men talk like that,
and never expect t 0... .C.8.C.: Reads mechanically.
It’s: all ; been said before —and in exactly the same
way ... . Mularula: Weak poetic tea.... Conrad: You
surely don’t quote Fitchett as a reliable authority.
His history, at times, is plain awful. Writer came
across a yarn of his, “The Dust of Ancient Battles,”
in November Life, and read two pages. In the first
it said that “only London” among European capitals,
“remained untouched” by Napoleon, and on the
second it alleged that Napoleon’s soldiers “entered
every European capital in turn as conquerors.” Seeing
that Nap. missed St. Petersburg, Stockholm, Copen-
hagen and Constantinople, that kind of authority is
a joke. .. .Short Wait: Almost every simple problem
of daily life has been tackled by some strenuous
reformer in the past, and he has left a footprint for
our guidance. In the days of the Emperor Ala-ad-
din there was no short weight in the Mogul Empire.
The man who gave it had not only to make good
the loss, but had a piece equal in weight to the
shortage cut out of his hinder parts. In the matter
of coals, rough timber, or other goods that are sold
by the truckload, this was apt to be serious. Ala-ad-
din had even an effective drink cure. He buried
the “tanked” alive so that they might not transmit
the craving. And when he was old and helpless
and his writ no longer ran, he bit himself in his
futile anger because his own sons took to liquor. . . .
Mulgaite: Don’t know what par. you refer to; but
if it was yours, send a claim for payment (specify-
ing date and page) to the accountant. .. .Koala:
What’s the use of trying to work off on us a frayed
gag like the fish limit? It only precipitates the
rest of your copy into the basket on suspicion....
Masareus: Better swap that typewriter for a bottle
of ink and a pen, if you can manage it... . Iris:
All true, no doubt, but somewhat too heavily put.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
Lance M.: That falling bricklayer jest is an an-
tique, and your bricklayer is too calm and tidy and
stiff. Don’t try and pass any more old gags, or we
will give an exhibition of cold fury that will surprise
y0u.... Leila B.: The figures are badly placed. The
handsome man in the armchair hasn’t got room to
move- and will certainly kick the wrinkled man with
the paper, if he doesn’t get away. Gag is smile-
less.... J.A. (V.): Jest is not beneath contempt, but
the three religious spies who are peering in at the
window look as if they had been pressed between the
leaves of a Bibje. . . .Gaite B. : The alleged drunken
man is badly posed and carelessly drawn; also, he
looks more like a sober small boy drawn on a large
scale. The newsboy with his sleeve turned up and
stockings turned down has a hump which doesn't add
to’' the general gaiety , and seems to have been unpre-
meditated by the artist. Gag is foolish.F.R.C.
(V.) : If you could only find some decent gags to fit
the drawings, and clean up the drawings so that they
would reproduce. Try and improve your line. .. .
J.H. (Sydney): Fearfully scratchy. Is the drunk
hump-backed, or is his coat wired, or has he some-
thing concealed under it?

Cecil Rae, mining engineer, is back in liis
native Australia for a month or two. Rae
has been five years at Ipoli; where his firm
(Edgar and Rae) are managers of a lot of
mines and industrial ventures throughout the
Malay States; and his next big job will be
to report on some allegedly first-chop pro-
positions right on the boi'der of Thibet. He
tells of a number of Australians in the Far
North, among them Sinclair, one time of
Victoria, now Director-General of Construc-
tion on the Siamese Railways. Sinclair
started on the North Eyell railway, so
Crotty and Lonergan did somebody good.
Rae laughs at the idea of the Philippines
stopping the Japs on the wav to Australia —
except so long as the wolf might halt to
pick up the meat thrown frotn the sleigh.
Korea, in his mind, is nothing to detain
them; the Formosans put up too good a
fight to make the Japanese “occupation”
anything but an unprofitable struggle inch
by inch for country comparatively not worth
it; and the recent destruction by volcanic
disturbances of part of Japan, and the
famine of more millions than Australia holds
altogether, strengthen the necessity for a
big outlet of the surplus. Incidentally he
says that Australia’s compulsory service
is the finest thing the world has known for
many days—or at least it would be if it
was a lot better than it is.
“Vic.”: It is just 31 years since, in Janu-
ary, IS83, Major and Mrs. Barker, with
"Happy Dinah,” began the Australian opera-
tions of the Salvation Army, on Collingwood
I lat. They could not afford to pay for a
hall, but Dr. Singleton lent them a kind of
shanty, which they used after preaching in
the open-air. How marvellous has been the
financial development since! The Army has
Australian property to the value of about a
Quarter of a million, obtained by cadging for
pennies—and often getting pounds. General
Booth was amazed with Barker’s rapid de-
velopment, and sent his son Ballington to
take the reins. Barker turned a bit rusty
at being thus shunted, but the crafty old
General had been frightened by the attempt
of his henchman Moore, in America, to
form a separate army. Ballington’s brother
Bramwell (the new general) is expected’in
Australia this year, to inspect the bean-
field.
“S.S.”: “Widower, 48, bald, affectionate.
Scotch. Attractive widow. Must have
So ran a recent advt. from the
Melbourne Age matrimonial column. Cau-
tious though the advertiser is, he allowed
himself one superfluous word (price Id.), and
that is “Scotch.”
“Billy Blue”: Gradually but surely the
big estates of N. S. are being cut up
and sold. One of the latest to go is Bolivia,
close to the town of Tenterfield. This was
in the first batch of squattages taken up
under occupation license in the late ’30’s.
Bolivia originally consisted of 50,000 acres
an es ti ma ted grazing capacity, of
10,000 sheep. The old charge for this big
slice of country was £100 a year, but in 1865
a reappraisement was made and the rent
was raised to. £150. In 1842 two young
sprigs of nobility, Edward and Eeonard
Irby, grandsons of Lord Boston, arrived
looking for experience, and went jaqkeroo-
ing on Archibald Windeyer’s station at
Deepwater, which adjoins Bolivia. They
got through all right and made good Aus-
tralians. Edward married the boss’s
daughter. He then, in the early ’50’s,
bought Bolivia from Charles Roberts, and
with, the aid of his brother Leonard, who
died in 1856, carried on the station success-
fully* By the aid of elastic land laws they
tairned most of the station into freehold.
Edward Irby died in 1900, whereupon
Bolivia passed into the hands of Martindale
White Brothers, who have now sold : it for
subdivision.

A new horror threatens the English-speaking world.
“James Gildea, Colonel, of II Hogarth-road, London,
5.W.,” has undertaken, “by desire of her Majesty
Queen Alexandra, the publication of all memorials
of whatever description, to his late Majesty King
Edward.” There are 400 of these foolish things in
the world so far collated by James Gildea, Colonel,
and great fear is hereby expressed that there are
more to come. James Gildea, Colonel, will include
in his precious waste of paper and good type and
irreproachable ink, “the events of his late Majesty’s
life, especially in connection with public ceremonies,
such as laying foundation stones.” The utter foolish-
ness of it! The hen that lays an egg; the bricklayer
who lays a brick; the Moses who lays the odds; the
king who lays a foundation stone, the poet whose
lay is rejected by the infuriated editor—why not put
them all into one volume ? And then the best thing
would be to tie an anchpt to the volume and drown
it. Go back into dim history and the great fburtda-
tioh-stohe layer of the world was Nabonidus, a mild,
eldterly architectural person who was made King of
Babylon just when it wanted a soldier and not a
mild potterer. He was away pottering when the
Persians took his kingdom;

“lieib”: “F.'.j.1.” (B. 8/l/’l4) is mistaken a§ to
the reason Of Btbdzky’s failure with Table Talk.
The Boom disclosures didn’t ittjute the paper. He
came to grief through a stupid libel on Bromley,
M.L.A., which Cost him £5OO damages, plus costs.
An apology would have been accepted, but he refused
to give it. “Brod.” was a singularly versatile man.
Born a Pole, he spoke that language, and to his
admirable English added Hebrew, French, German,
Russian, and goodness knows what. Superlative was
the tact of this foreigner ih adapting himself to
Melbourne Arid itS journalism; life first came under
my rtotibe Acting Marquis dp Treval, in the play of
“Not a Bad Judge,” with Jewish amateurs, at the
Opera House. . ijis marriage . with MiSs Leon, of
Geelong, afforded him a little bit of siting with
which to laqnfeh Table . TALK: .After the. Bromley
fiasco,, he said t 0 me: “I’m, A ruined mail,” and the
next I heard hb was off with all his family to San
Francisco. I fancy that his friehd Moses Aaron
Rapken, of San Fran., financed him for the transfer.
Brodzky there edited the Wasp. Unluckily, he ar-
rived a little before the earthquake, which propelled
him to London. There was a cable not long ago
about his having come into a lot of money, but that
does not appear settled either one way or the other.

“Asmodeus”: The “literals” which are born in the
bush newspaper office are usually pretty dull, but I
struck one recently in Nor’-West N.S.W. which caused
some trouble. A local resident, deported to knock at
the gates of Heaven, was referred tb as having betiii
in his younger days “a well-knowh houSe-breaker,”
and the family was quite annoyed about it.
Robert Donald, editor of London Daily Chronicle
and president of the English Institute of Journalists,
has been cursing the miserable salaries paid by
British dailies to their humbler inkslingers. In
London, salaries are higher than formerly, thanks to
the lead given by Northcliffe on his Daily Mail and
allied journals, but in the provincial towns the rank
and file are no better off now than they were 20
years ago. There are many country reporters who
do not receive the wages of unskilled laborers. In
one town of 100,000 people senior reporters are paid
only 30s. a week; in another of 170,000, reporters
get only 255. a week and sub-editors 50s. ; and in
a city of 250,000 one important paper has four sub-
editors whose combined salaries aggregate a magnifi-
cent weekly £7 12s. 6d. The men who climb or are
pushed to the top of the tree receive the pay of
Cabinet Ministers; for the unlucky ones the Inky
Way is a sweated industry which yells at the top
of its voice for plain trades-unionism without frills.
“Blue Mask” : Was shown an indifferently preserved
copy of London Times, dated January 1, 1788, re-
cently. About the only clearly decipherable item
was this: “THEATRE. Drury Lane. Hamlet —
whose doom, at least this season, has, unfortunately,
been ‘to walk the night and strut to empty benches
—performed yesterday evening its accustomed penance
in lieu of Tamerlane. Were not this excellent
tragedy so often used ‘on the spur of the occasion,
we think such admirable acting as Kemble’s Prince
of Denmark would meet with more attendance-
more of applause it could not have. Mrs. Ward’s
performance of the Queen is the best proof of Mrs.
Siddon’s assertion, that ‘Gertrude had more about
her than critics were aware of.’ Mrs. Ward’s dis-
tracted look in the closet scene aided most powerfully
Kemble’s piteous exclamation of—‘On hitp! on him.’
Indeed, the noble delineation of that difficult char-
acter did much credit to this rising actress.” There
seems something uncanny about the warmth of that
last sentence after the dust of 125 years has lam
on it.

“Incas”: Came across two copies of a pornographic
print called the Firebrand, published in Melbourne
in 1880. Only two issues appeared, but they were
enough to provide full particulars of the numerous
houses of pleasure which in those days abounded.
Complete pedigrees were given of the ladies of no
importance of that period. The Firebrand, edited
by “The Waif” (he didn’t present the most distant
resemblance to “The Waif” who writes verses for
The Bulletin in 1914), contained eight quarto
pages of unadultered libel and interesting news
equally mixed. Flossie Fewclothes didn’t relish the
new Debrett, and its editor was chased out of town.
He knew Melbourne all right, judging by the inti-
mate details he gave of Cleal’s, the Rainbow and
other resorts of the jeunesse doree in an era when
the word Wowser had not been coined, and the police
had not acquired the move-’em-on habit.

It Makes You Shuddor
No matter how dainty food may be, or how carefully prepared, it is simply
repugnant to you if your stomach is out of order. That dull pain in your stomach
causes you to simply loathe the sight of food —you cannot eat, and yet you want
something and don’t know what. When you do eat you suffer tortures afterwards.
Do you realise what will happen to you if you continue in this way? Your body
will become depleted, and any sickness is apt to take hold of you. You posi-
tively can avoid all these troubles by taking
Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules.
The reason why any wholesome food is not properly digested is because the
stomach lacks some important element of digestion. Some stomachs lack peptone,
others are deficient in gastric juice or hydrochloric acid. , The one thing necessary
in any case of poor digestion is to supply those digestive elements which the
stomach lacks, and nothing does this so thoroughly and safely as DR. SHELDON’S
DIGESTIVE TABULES. They digest what you eat, thus giving the stomach
a rest and assistance until it is restored to its normal action and vigor.
One of these Tabules will digest 1500 grains of meat, eggs and other whole-
some food. They are a genuine tonic, because they bring about in the only natural
way a restoration of nerve power, a building up of lost tissue and appetite, by the
digestion and assimilation of wholesome food.

The Lion’s Head.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I HAD the sky-suite at St. Job’s at the
time, and was still so enamored of it
that 1 actually stayed in at nights.
But this night no one but a fool would have
gone out, for it was a wild and indecent
sort of night— wind howling over the gables
and shrieking weirdly amid the jungle of
chimney-pots; while the roar of the rain on
rhe slate roof made a deep bass in the in-
fernal symphony.
But within the sky-suite all was tran-
quillity. The electric light beamed softly
through the opal-glass globes, and on the
great red hearth the three big (iron) logs
(filled with asbestos blocks) had taken on
incandescence and looked as though they
were about to crumble into a heap of glowing
embers. That was the beauty of those logs.
They always looked as though just about to
do it, and never did. it was a delightful
idea on the part of someone, copied, no
doubt, from the Greek idea of Elysium.
I was deep in the latest book, and had just
lost myself comfortably in the story when
the bell on the outside door tinkled softly. 1
reluctantly went out. As I opened the outer
door that led to the great landing at the
top of the stairs a gale of wind rushed up
the lift well, giving me and my door a side
kick as it went, and blowing right into the
tiny hall the soaked female figure which had
tried to make some remark and had lost the
grip of it through her cape being blown
round her face and over her head.
Although instinctively afraid of women l
drew this one inside my little hall and with
a great effort got the door closed. Then 1
turned to look at my visitor.
It was Katherine Burney, the girl who
had thrown me over to marry Jack Burney ;
and-the spectacle of her, soaked to the skin,
almost broke me up.
“What on earth has brought you out on
such an awful night?”
“I’m in trouble. Are you alone V”
“Yes —for a wonder. But won’t you eatch
pneumonia at the least?”
“I must take my chance. I simply had to
come. For, strange to say, I have no one
else I can trust.”
I poured out a glass of wine, and she
gulped it down eagerly, and then a faint
glow came into her rain-paled cheeks.
“It’s Jack,” she said hurriedly. “He has
not been home for three nights, and at the
office they have not seen him for four days.
I’m afraid to go to the police about him, as
they threatened last time to lock him up if
they ever caught him in any den again.”
“Den! What is it, then? Drugs?”
“Opium!” And she turned her head away
and looked steadily into the fire.
“And you say he has been on benders like
this before?”
“This is the fourth prolonged one. And
I’m so afraid of the police getting him.” •
“Where was he found before? Who
brought him home?”
“Constable Flynn. He lives just a few
doors round the corner of the street from us.
It was he who told Jack that the orders
were to ‘put him in’ next time he was caught
under the influence.”
“Merely a threat to scare him off the drug
—just as though any drugger could be scared
off his dope by the police. Rabbits that
they are. And now you want me to try to
find him?”
“Yes, and bring him back to me.”
The humor of the situation must have hit
the wind where it lived, for it went off into
a long series of howls.
I tried hard to find a cab in which to send
Mrs. Burnev home ; but the cabmen had fled
and only the roaring inexorable trams
stuck to their work, and thundered
emptily through the flooded streets. As soon
as I had got rid of her I cursed Jack Burney
heartily. It was enough to kill a man to be
out on such a night, and half a dozen times
I was on the point of letting everything go,
and making a hurried retreat for the snug
sky-room. But, somehow. I managed to steel
myself up to it, and keep going. There was
one man I knew who could give me the
whereabouts of every opium joint in Sydney
-—the Man from Madras. The trouble was
to find the Man from Madras, for it was safe
to wager my flawless reputation and stain-
less honor that if he had any money at all
he was in one of those self-same joints.
However, it turned out he had no money,
and I found him sitting in front of a scrap
of fire, glaring gloomily at the fading coals.
He looked up wearily.
“You’re dying for a smoke, aren’t you?”
“I am, indeed. If you’ve any mercy about
you give me the price of one.”
“Yes. two —provided you can tell me where
I can find Jack Burney.”
“How the devil should I know where he
is? Do you think I haunt every smoking
joint in Sydney?”
“You know where they are, and you can
get in. So get your coat on and, as soon as
we find Burney, the dope is yours!” I said
in my most ruthless voice.
“I’ll take you straight to him. But you’ve
got to spring a small rise. Will you put up
enough with the Heathen to see me through
till pay day?”
“How much is that?”
“Thirty bob will cover it —and you can
have Burney in three minutes from the time
we ( leave the front door.”
“It’s a bargain. I’m beginning to feel
damp. Another hour of this and I’m as good
as dead.”
. The way the Man from Madras got into
his coat was_ amazing—almost as startling as
the speed with which he got down the dark
stairs.
* * * *
“Malabar Jack’s” opium joint was not a
nice place; and the furnishing of it had not
caused a heavy drain on Jack’s capital when
he opened in business. But it had the repu-
tation of being the safest joint in Sydney.
• r 3 ( ??i e reason it was never raided ; and, to
Malabar” his due, most of the people
who frequented it were said to be decent citi-
zens in every respect. But then, opium
eaters and smokers very rarely are criminals.
( lve ip a world apart, toiling steadily
whim m this one to get the price of exit.
' ery respectable place, this!” said the
Man from Madras. “I’ll have to go in before-
hand and go bail for you. Malabar is very
particular.” „
He vanished. Two minutes later a tall,
well-dressed man came out of a house a few
doors up, and as he strolled past eyed me
critically, turned suddenly into a lane and
vanished. Then, a few minutes later, the
Man from Madras came out the way he had
gone in, and conducted me into darkness. I
heard doors opened and shut, and was
hustled along a dark passage only to find my-
self in a back yard. Then up some steps and
into a house where every room opening off
the passages seemed to be filled.
Madras led the way into one of these
places, and there, lying on his side, his hand
still clutching the pipe, was Jack Burney.
Beside him on the same board was the man
who had shared his lamp. This was a gigan-
tic negro, and, as I bent down to shake
Burney’s shoulder I caught sight of the
negro’s head and face. Like himself, the
head was gigantic, but the most astounding
feature was the remarkable expression of the
face.
It was the head and face of a black lion
on a human body.
I forgot all about Burney, and, walking
round, looked at this amazing creature. lie
was breathing softly. A half-smile played
round his leonine mouth. His right hand
was swathed in bandages which extended to
the elbow.
I was interrupted by the arrival of the
Man from Madras, with Malabar in close
attendance.
“You want to get him away, sir? Well, I
can assist you. Get a vehicle and draw up
at that lane where you lost sight of me ; and
when you’re ready I’ll bring him out. It’s
time he gave it a spell. By the way, this
man says you are standing to him till pay-
day to the extent of ?>os. If it’s right I’ll
give him a pipe right away, as he’s got the
craving real bad to-night.”
“Here’s the money. Now, how do I get
out?”
“This way. Here you are. That’s the
street you came in from. Now, as soon as I
see the vehicle at the lane two bring
him out and dump him in. He’ll be
dead to the world for the next two hours,
and he’ll reek of the drug, too, for a bit; so,
if you don’t like the odor, don’t ride inside
with him. He’s lucky to have friends to
look after him —darned lucky.”
“Well, I wouldn’t bother about him, ex-
cept for his wife’s sake.”
“Gee-willicans! You don’t say he’s got a
wife !”
“He has, and a very nice wife, too.”
“Lord help her!” said Malabar, disappear-
ing.
The rain had stopped, and, as I went round
looking for a cab, I heard the familiar toot-
toot, and a taxi dropped from Heaven. The
driver drew up and I explained the situation.
He was agreeable; and we went round and
stood at the entrance to the lane. I went
under the lamp to count out some silver for
the men who carried my patient out. When
I looked round I saw them closing the door
on him. I gave them some coins.
“Can ycr manage him when yer get him
home? He’s powerful heavy, so if yer likes,
boss, we’ll nip in with ’im and carry ’im
right up any stairs.”
It was an excellent idea. Certainly, he
was not in a fit state to send home. So I’d
take him to my own place, and get him right;
then send him back to his wife in a decent
state.
“Good idea. Get in, and I’ll go outside
with the driver.”
t They got in, and away we went.
When we got to St. Job’s I went up the
steps, opened the door, and brought the elec-
tric lift down. It was in darkness, but
worked all right, and, as there was not room
for the four of us in it, I went up ahead,
opened the doors of the sky-suite, sent the
lift down again, and started them up. On
the landing I gave them a few shillings for
their trouble, and then went to the telephone
to ring up old Dr. Reg to come round and fix
Burney up. While in the telephone box I
heard the front door close with a bang, and
then again the toot-toot of the taxi.
Dr. Reg swore a little, but finally said he
would be there in 10 minutes. I went down
and waited for him at the door, wondering if
I should ring up Mrs. Burney and let her
know he was safe.
Before I made up my mind the doctor ar-
rived. “Thought it was better to say nothing
till we got him round,” he said. “Then I’ll
run him home in my jigger. Is he up in
your rooms?”
When we got upstairs I suggested to the
doctor he should have a nip, just to keep the
odor of the opium out. He thought it an ex-
cellent idea, and then we walked into where
they had laid him on the sofa, and I nearly
fell down dead.
They had brought me home the lion-headed
nigger.
The doctor’s language was awful.
“This is a pretty kettle of fish. You say
Jack Burney was Iving on the same board as
this animal? Perhaps used the same pipe,
eh?”
“Nothing on earth more probable. Isn t
nice, is it?”
“No, it isn’t nice. You’ll appreciate the
fact that it’s almost nasty when I tell you
that this in front of us is the real first
prize exhibit of leprosy I have ever seen.
I’m afraid you’ll have to burn your sofa.”
I looked at him to see if he was joking.
But the intensity of his face killed the idea.
Then there was a really long and eloquent
silence.
“Yes?” I said, looking at him.
“What do you think, yourself?”
“Jack must not go home.”
“Go home be damned. What I’m think-
ing over is the question of what to do with
him. Shall we bang him into the lazarette
or shanghai him. You see, it may not de-
velop for an indefinite time. But if it's
there — it's there. And he may not elect to
stay in the lazarette, and if he shows no
signs I don’t see how he is to be kept there.
No. he must go.”
On the sofa the lion-headed negro moved
uneasily. The bandaged hand slipped out
from under the top coat they had thrown
over him, and Dr. Reg saw it for the first
time.
“See that hand —see how the bandage runs

ZAM-BUK IS THE MOTHER’S FRIEND.
Accidents will happen even in the best-regulated families. Healthy
youngsters seem to be always “in the wars.” Housework abounds with
mishaps for busy wives and harassed mothers; and the bread-winner often
returns from work with a more or less serious injury. Just what every
home needs is Zam-Buk. A pot and a bandage on a handy shelf, where they
are handy for instant use, save untold pain, time and money.
When the little one runs in from his play with a smarting, dirt-filled
scrape on his knee, simply wash the part and smear with Zam-Buk. When
father cuts or scrapes his hand, the handy pot of Zam-Buk again meets the
emergency; and the housewife or mother continually finds it a real friend
for the burns she receives while cooking, the scalds of a washing day, or the
knocks, etc., of dusting. Children like Zam-Buk because it is cooling,
soothing and pleasant. Their elders value it still more highly because it
is also antiseptic and a powerful germicide, preventing poisoning, festering
and disease. Daily mishaps make Zam-Buk a daily need—therefore, keep
Zam-Buk handy.
CHILD’S SHOCKING BURN.
ARM COMPLETELY HEALED BY ZAM-BUK.
No matter how careful we may be, accidents
will happen. Mrs. L. Stevens, of 3 Seacomb
Street, North Fitzroy, Melbourne, says:—
“While ironing I accidentally put the iron
on my litle girl’s arm, which was extended
across the table. The flesh was seared from
the elbow to the wrist, and the skin all blis-
tered in a shocking manner. The agony
was something awful, and the wound
afterwards broke, presenting an awful
appearance. I took Bertha to a chemist,
who prescribed ointment, which did not
do any good, for, when the bandages were
taken off, the flesh and skin came along
with them, and made her arm worse.
“I had heard so many good reports of Zam-Buk, which impressed me so much
that I purchased a supply, and dressed her arm with it. Zam-Buk cooled the
burning pain, and gave her the greatest ease from inflammation and swelling. This
was most encouraging, so we continued using Zam-Buk daily, until her arm was
thoroughly healed and well.”

Chamberlain’s
Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy.
This is the Vst medicine procurable for bowel complaint in all its forms. It
relieves pain in the stomach, dysentery, diarrhoea and colic. It has been the means
of saving more pain and suffering than any other known remedy. Thousands of
mothers in all parts of the world have given it to their children and now sing its
praises. This medicine is especially valuable in checking Diarrhoea which nearly
always attacks the babies when teething. One dose will relieve pains in the stomach
and it seldom takes more than three or four doses to stop a severe attack of Diarrhoea.
Always take Chamberlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy at the first unusual
looseness of the bowels. There is no class of ailments that attack the system quicker
than bowel complaints and when a medicine is wanted it is wanted quickly. What
has made Chamberlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy so popular is that the relief
is just as quick. It is a medicine that should be kept in the home at all times and we
advise you to procure a bottle at once, for it will save trouble later on and perhaps be
the means of saving a life.

When you lack energy, have no interest
in life, feel dull and stupid, all you need is
a dose of Chamberlain’s Tablets. They
will make you feel like a new man and
give you an appetite like a bear. They
will do you more good than a five shilling
bottle of tonic.
“Well, the sooner they do the better I’ll
be pleased. I’ve taken a sudden dislike to
him.”
“It isn’t in the same street as the dislike
I’ve suddenly taken to Jack Burney. Where’s
your telephone?”
* * * *
“We must get Burney out of that place
before siey slii,ft thing. Otherwise,
they U him gs a suspect." And Burney
is going foy a long trip.”
“For his wife’s sake !”
“Exactly. Now I’ll have to take him to
my place, and then you get this chap away,
and when he’s gone make for my diggings.
I’ll have Burney there, and I may want
your assistance. Now, I’m off.”
“I wish I’d stayed at home now!” I said
as he went out.
“Most fortunate for a certain married
lady you didn’t,” said the doctor, closing the
door with a bang.
Ten minutes later the doctor rang up, and
explained that Burney had left the opium
joint, and before going had told Malabar
Jack he had a great desire to go home —•
and that, in fact, he was going home regard-
less of the wigging he would get. “Don’t
worry about that animal in your room, but
get up and watch for Burney on the north
of his house, and I’ll be on guard on the
south. If he comes along run him right
down to me. Now, fly!”
I disliked the idea of leaving “the animal”
in my rooms, or even in the house. He
might wake up, get wandering about, and
scare someone to death. But it seemed most
necessary that Jack Burney should be caught
before he got home.
After waiting an hour in the wind and
the rain which had started to make up lost
time we knocked at Burney’s door, intending
to get Mrs. Burney to go down and stay
with the doctor’s wife while we made a
pretence of trying to And her husband. But,
to our disgust, we could raise no one. So
it was evident that Mrs. Burney had gone
out. I was wet to the skin. The water
squirted through the lace-holes of my boots.
I cursed Burney, and said I would go home.
“So will I,” said the doctor, “but first of
all we must tell the police, and, confound
it, that fellow’s still in your rooms. Here,
get in, and we’ll run down to headquarters
and get a clean sweep made.”
We ran down to headquarters, and four
disgusted policemen came along to take
charge of the leper. We entered the sky
parlor softly. The fire was glowing tran-
quilly, the electric light beamed through
its opalescent glass globes, and from my
bedroom came the noise of a pig procession.
Cold fear gripped my heart as we tiptoed
in, to find that the negro had drunk all my
whisky, undressed and got into my bed.
A policeman prodded him with a baton.
“Here, wake up, wake up ! Do you know
where you are?”
The vast eyelids rose slowly, the sleepy
eyes looked out, moving from one to the
other without the faintest sign of head
movement.
“What are you doing here?” asked the
same policeman.
“I dunno! Just woke up an’ found meself
here, sah !”
“Well, do you know where you are?”
“No, sah, but seems like Heaven. Is it
Heaven, sah?”
The policeman ignored the query and
commended the unfortunate wretch to get
up and dress. But he seemed disinclined,
and the police were frankly and obviously
afraid of him. It took half an hour of
persuasion and the best part of another
bottle of whisky to induce him to rise and
dress. Poor devil! I shall never forget the
wistful, hungry look he cast round those
pleasant diggings as he passed out between
the policemen.
He had made a pretty mess of things for
me. My sofa and bed were doomed to de-
struction, and, to tell the truth, I was half
scared to stay in the place or keep one stick
of the furniture. Infinite possibilities seemed
to lurk in every corner and nook and crack.
And, most important of all, I had to find
somewhere to stay that night. But the
doctor solved that question by informing me
I was going with him. When we went I
left a note on the door requesting the maid
to keep out till the place was disinfected,
as a diseased person had called and perhaps
left some of his germs behind him.
Then we went off to bed, too worn, o,ut to
worry about Burney.
* * * *
Next morning, after driving headlong
through the sunlit streets, we located Burney
at a filthy den by the waterside, close to
Miller’s Point. We. bribed the keeper of
the joint to let him stay-—detain him in fact
—tilt we sent for him, and then we departed
in haste to find out how to have him
shanghaied. But on the way we recoiled
from, the job. The doctor admitted it would:
be a,ll right if Mrs. Burney were agreeable ;
but then we could not say how that young
lady would ta,ke the mysterious disappear-
ance of her husband. So the doctor swung
the head of the car round and we made for
the Health Department, where we detailed
the full facts.
The Health Department didn’t seem en-
thusiastic about taking charge of Burney,
and got to work in a very lackadaisical
manner- We heard afterwards that in less
than 30 minutes they swooped down on the
opium joint, and carried him off by the
help of one division of police, while another
party ran in the. keeper of the joint and
generally broke up the establishment. I
was a bit worried about the running-in of
the joint proprietor. He had given us some
useful information about where to find a
gentleman who would undertake a neat, slick
shanghaing. He seemed to be a man of
parts, and when the subject was first men-
toined inquired amiably :
“Well, gents, jus’ tell me ’zcly what you
wants. D’yo’ want the blanker murdered,
or what!”
And now that he had been “lumbered” he
might feel exasperated. I suggested we
should see about getting him bail, to mollify
him; but the doctor would have none of it.
So I gave up the idea and started for the
office.
At the office I got the shock of my life.
Two detectives were there anxious to inter-
rogate me about a story told by the mis-
creant who ran the opium den that I had
paid him £25 to shanghai Mr. Burney. He
had taken the money and was only pre-
vented from reporting the matter to the
police by the fact that the arrest tool: place
while he was making his toilet. Mrs.
Burney was there, the picture of righteous
indignation, and it seems she had told the
detectives how I was actuated by spite
against Burney for cutting me out. And
while the wrangle raged two men ip blue
arrived from the Health Department to take
me into quarantine as q contqct with a cop-
farmed and q suspected leper
I inquired bitt e ?ly if there were apy more
people to interview, and was told that there
were two people, from St. Job’s, upstairs.
They were anxious to know what compensa-
tion I proposed to pay the Trust that ran
the place for bringing lepers into the
premises, and thereby causing the whole
building to be quarantined and everybody
on the top floor to be segregated.
I’m afraid I’m in for trouble —all through
obliging an old sweetheart.

The Good Time Coming.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We will see upon the screen, in their natural
colors, without flash or flicker, the local happen-
ings of the day, events that have transpired but a
few hours or moments before. And from the screen,
in their natural colors, will come the real voices of
the participants, and also all of the accompanying
sounds and noises that were a part of the actual
occurrence. .. .And we will take it as a matter of
course....
As we wend our way homeward we wi11.... have
purchased the early-morning edition of the local
events film. This we will review in the privacy of
our parlor or music-room before retiring for the
night. Upon arriving at our home, on the outskirts
of the city, we find that the children have just re-
turned from a party next door, where they were
entertained by seeing and hearing one of the best
and latest grand operas, for which the highest-priced
stars of the day had performed.— Blobs of exceeding
great joy from the “forecast” of an imported Yank
bioscope man, in Sydney Sunday Sun.
HERE’S a joyous day a-coming for the
I Ac-tor who is bumming
Where the gratis long-beer shines
upon the Bar —
Where the talk is fights and “hosses,” and
colossal gains and losses
When “I was understudy to me Star!”
For the Bar will then be emptied—its
habitues gone, tempted
By the salaries gigantic offered them
To our local Kean and Irving (now ne-
glected, but deserving),
By the philanthropic Moving-Picture Men !
Oh, the present day theay-ters will be very
small pertaters,
And the music-halls but few upon the hill,
When Australia is a-bustle with (imported)
Yankee hugtle—
When everybody helps to fill The Bill!
For there’ll be no time for thinking, love, or
business, or for drinking ;
And there’ll be no chance of rest, or going
slow,
When with practised agitation our Austra-
lian population
Will be occupied in turning out The Show!
We “will” see (no shall about it!) men who
“cannot do without it”
Paid to wear the joyous vine-leaves in their
hair,
Till their wayward feet have slithered and
they’re jubilantly blithered
Before a staring crowd —that’s paid to stare!
And an energetic “copper” (also paid, as
will be proper)
Will raise them up, and gently run them
in—
And the film will be completed when the
Drunk charge has heen sheeted,
And the Court relieves the Headaches of
their tin!
Then our Ac-tors —once in earnest, who in
accents of the sternest
Bade the doubtful Barmaid fill ’em up again,
Indicating we were paying—all day long will
just be playing
A familiar rSle in very happy vein!
And at night the Film will show them, as
we’ve learned to love and know them,
Doing poojah at the shrine of mighty Beer;
Or recounting former glories, or relating
azure stories,
And being paid a thousand pounds a year!
And the Film will not be silent: there’ll be
poises, soft or violent,
Snch as gurgles, suckings, laughter, chink of
cash,
Sounds of revelry and curses jokes and
Bacchanalian verses ;
And, occasionally, glasses going smash!
With the (paid) crowd’s jovial laughter;
and the “copper” coming after;
And the fallings, and the scuffles, and the
yells;
And the cold voice of the sergeant as he
counts the boozers’ argent;
And the ringing of the bolts that lock the
cells!
Life, in every form and facet, from the
“Birth ad.” to Hie Jacet,
Will, assuredly, be “faithfully portrayed,”
From the squalor of divorces, to the doping
• of good horses —
And all who’re “in the picture” will be paid!
Balls and murders, wrecks and battles;
babies quarrelling for rattles,
And the whirling water-bottles of Debate;
Also, seated ’neath an awning, “statesmen,”
home in Loandon, pawning
Every asset of their silly, trusting State!
All the rotten tricks of turfers, and the
luscious curves of surfers,
And the butchers, and the milk-ohs on their
rounds,
With their trophies from the slaughter, and
their subdititious water,
Will be “filmed”— with their accompanying
sounds !
And the agents, charging high rates, and
the fruit- and fish-shop pirates,
And the spicy little episodes in flats ;
Showing, possibly, what you did; will be
“filmed” —to be concluded
With the picture of a poet yelling “Rats!”
