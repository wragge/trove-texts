"THE BULLETIN."
(published at SYDNEY, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly-Australia's Nonpareil
Illustrated Newpaper.
"The Bulletin."
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dis-
tinctive Australian National Policy i
Tins Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
One -Person, one Vote.
Complete Secularisation and Freedom of State
education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
Lie World.
Australia for the Australians. —The cheap
Chinaman, the cheap nigger, and the
cheap European pauper to be absolutely
excluded.
A State Panic, the issue of bank-notes to be a
State monopoly.
The direct election of Ministers by Parlia-
ment, instead -of Party Government or
rather Government by Contradiction.
A new Parliamentary System - one House to
be elected by constituencies as at present;
the other to be chosen by the whole
country voting as one Constituency.
A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance.
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-
ship of Land.
'Hie Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles cf so-called “ nobility. ’
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
- The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter that is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started 13 years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become the representative Australian
journal, because it possesses a vitality lacked
by the countless newspaper-ventures in which
Australian capitalists have unavailingly spent
large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
add follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after th
itst issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin's inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
uice-a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
I The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
ousanda of pounds in fitting their buildings
ith the latest appliances for high-class printing
id the production of illustrations, and they have
>vv issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
rm—printed with new type of improved legi-
lity on the finest paper, and adorned with
;etches from the hands of the ablest and best-
lid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established A us-
alian journal which, throughout its career, has
;en consistently Radical. It points with pride
i the fact that for years it stood alone among
icular newspapers in advocating the Irish
atronal Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
aliaii journal which denounced the Soudan
xpedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
rogress: it is the forceful summons to the
'usade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
ewer, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
lisery which now afflicts British humanity,
gainst the chums of avaricious clergy who claim
i monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
f grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
ny human authority which has not been granted
y the people over whom it is exercised, The
iuLEETIN will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
mrnal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
ransferred from the columns of a daily paper
.sued from the same office. The Bulletin is
ot connected with any other paper, and the
natter it contains is all specially prepared by its
wn unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
ralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
md, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
>y runners in the streets of every Australasian
apital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
mblished south of the equator, and,is the only
Vustralasian publication which enjoys a popu-
arity unhampered by the political boundaries
hat so closely restrict other journals to the
■domes in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
;o the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
if Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maonland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
ropular city publication and the organ of the
utelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
iopolarity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
■asily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
>f all journals issued in Australasia, Ihe Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
me reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
■uul best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

And Mistakes.
THE CALIGRAPH is the typewriter generally used in the Government Departments of New South Wales, there being over one hundred machines distributed amongst the public offices.
Nearly all the great business and legal firms of Sydney use the CALIGRAPH. _ . .
THE COUNTRY LIST OF USERS has increased wonderfully during this year. A good typewriter is more useful in the country than in the city, because it places all the facilities for printing
at the immediate disposal of the operator.
Fifteen Copies at one Operation!
This may be accomplished without the least difficulty by interleaving carbon sheets. In this, the most useful of all points in a typewriter, the CALIGRAPH is unapproachable.
Special Instruction Unnecessary.
THE CALIGRAPH is so simple in its construction, and the arrangement of its keyboard so convenient, that with the aid of the Instruction Book anyone may learn in a week to write as fast as
the most expert penman. In a comparatively short time a speed of from 60 to 100 words a minute may be obtained.

The Edison Mimeograph
This is, without doi bt, the best duplicating machine in the market.
W 1 mn worked in conjunction with the Cali graph, or any other first-class
bar machine, 1500 copies of a circular or other document may be taken off
one typewritten stencil. For autographic reproduction a plain-pointed
stylus is used against file backing, with the result that all the copies are fac-
similes of the ordinary writing of the user, and not mere dotted apologies for
it, as is the case with a machine fitted with a wheel-tipped stylu .
The Mimeograph may be had in all sizes, from note to brief.
TYPEWRITERS’ SUPPLIES,
c agents for the Caligraph throughout Australia provide supplies for all typewriters. The Caligraph Linen Papers are the best that can be obtained either for single copy work or manifolding.

GIBBONS,
™°“trebly-qualified and registered in London
and the Colonies, as a Physician and Surgeon,
received his Medxcai Education in the English
and Scottish Universities, and comnleted his
studies in the leading hospitals of Europe. He
has made a life-long study of
Private, Nervous
AND
SKIM DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period
of many years, obtained the highest position in
ms profession. The various diseases embraced in
his speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
YOUISTGr IVOESKT
AND
THOSE WHO WISH TO MARRY,
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more matured age, suffer from any of the follow-
mg symptoms, namely Frequent headaches;
giddiness; drowsiness in the day time; irregu-
larity of the bowels; feeling of fullness after eat-
mg; specks floating before the eyes; halos or circles
round a candle; cold hands and feet; pains in the
back or under the shoulder-blade; tenderness
of the breast-bone on pressure; yellowish dis-
charge from the mouth on to the pillow during
sleep; palpitation of the heart; unpleasant
dreams; clammy hands; an aversion to
society ; a whitish or cloudy sediment in
the urine, after standing; fear of some-
thing dreadful about to happen ; impure blood •
spots or pimples on the back, chest, legs'
or face ; failing memory; hacking cough ; falling
of the hair, &c., should consult him, for he is
now enabled, quickly and effectually, to remove
the cause, and so prevent life-long misery.
On Receipt of 6d. in Stamps He Will Send,
POST FREE,
A Large, Handsomely-Bound Boot,
fully describing how all private, nervous, and
diseases may be quickly and permanently
CURED, without loss of time and money. This
book will be of great assistance in making you
thoroughly with those diseases so
common in these Colonies, and may enable you to
restore some poor sufferer to health and happiness
that has lost all hope.
ONE FOUND is Sufficient to Send
for Remedies necessary for the Cure of
DEBILIT y,
and should be enclosed in the first letter.
Remember, “Procrastination is the Thief of
Time.” If, therefore, you experience any of the
symptoms enumerated above Do Not Delay.
Your case requires advice, and you can either call
and consult the Doctor personally, or, if you
reside at a distance, you can sit down quietly in
the privacy of your chamber and write out a full
description of your case, and send it by post.
D Ft. GIBBONS
Will then write you a candid and straightforward
opinion. If, in writing, you do not feel compe-
tent to fully describe your case, send 6d. in
stamps, and Dr. Gibbons will send you, post
free, the Latest Edition of his Celebrated Work
in which you will find enclosed a list of carefully-
prepared questions that will assist you in giving a
true description of your ailment.
NONE NEED DESPAIR,
As in every case undertaken by Dr. GIBBONS,
A Permanent Cure
Is absolutely assured.
Dr. GIBBONS uses none but the very purest
remedies, and never, under any circumstances
prescribes Mercury in any form.
PATIENTS are reminded that their letters are
Destroyed by Fire
immediately they have been read and answered,
and that their cases and names will remain a
secret between the Doctor and themselves.
Dr. GIBBONS has documentary evidence of

TESTIMONIALS
Like the following are constantly arriving
from all f arts of the world and prove con-

quabtiespossessed by Or. Pierce’s
T p AI *yANIC CHAIN
BELT. Read the letters:
From Australia.
Me. W. H. Peice, of Wells Silver Mine,
Emmaville, N. S. W., writes as follows:
“To W. H. Soul & Co., (Agents for Dr.
Pierce’s Belts and Trusses), 158 Pitt St.,
Sydney: Sirs:—l am in receipt of Belt
and books of instruction, and can safely
Bay that your advertisements are very truthful in regard to
the statement tliat a man feels the electrical strength of
thebelt as soon as it is placed on his body, fori felt the effect
of the belt as soon as I placed it on, and believe me, I am
a sure advocate of this belt.
,, From England.
Mr. Chas, Middleton, of No. 76 Aston St. t Birmingham,
speaks as follows: “I can say that I have feltbetter, agreat
deal, since I have used your Galvanic Chain Belt, and I
thank you very much. I have taken patent medicines but
I shall not take any more. You can use my name in praise
of your Belt.’* _
From America.
Me. J. W. Pohlman, Tacoma, U. S. A., writes—" Tour No.
3 Galvanic Chain Belt has done what a whole drug store
could not do, for it has cured me of Sciatic Rheumatism
and Weak Back, also, which came on through a fall into a
ship’s hold some ten years ago. I fell 18 feet on my hack,
and although I got up as if nothing had happened, the back
troubled meever since until I tried your belt. For oneyear
now I have felt as I used to at to."

M'BURNEY, WALLIS & CO.'S
WOOL STORE!.
Thk woolgrowing industry of Australasia, being a
matter of vast importance not only to those who
are immediately connected with pastoral pursuits,
but to every Australian, a more than ordinary
interest surrounds any fresh development of the
various outlets for the disposal of our staple pro-
duct. A few months ago three young gentlemen
—Messrs. N. M'Burney, E. S. Wallis, and A.
Henson, commercial offsprings of the great parent
wool-king, the late Thomas Sutcliffe Mort—inau-
gurated their opening wool-sale under very auspi-
cious circumstances by a festive gathering of lead-
ing representative gentlemen who were favoured
with an elaborate address from the evergreen
septuagenarian Parkes, on the growth and progress
of the wool-trade of New South Wales. Theaccorn-
panying illustration presents a mere sectional view
of the sample-room in their very extensive store
situated in Margaret street, Sydney, particulars
of which will be more minutely given later on.
At this stage the writer feels that Bulletin
readers may not be disposed to regard with in-
difference a condensed description of the wool-
trade of the province from its foundation to the
latest official returns presented to the public by
Sectional View of Sample Room .
Mr. T. A. Ooghlan, Government Statistician.
In 1795 the various flocks were estimated roughly
at 1000, but at the end of 1891, nearly a
century after, the number of sheep in New South
Wales alone reached the astounding total of
61,831,416, or fully half the aggregate of all
the Australian provinces and Maoriland.
Considering the many difficulties attending
pastoral pursuits in the early days of our existence
as a colony, this gigantic bound is simply marvel-
lous. Macarthur seemed to have applied himself
particularly to the breeding of the high-class
animals, and, with this object in view, he, a few
years later, paid a visit to the Cape of Good Hope
and made a valuable selection from the choicest
nocks imported from Europe. About 1825, sheep-
breeding was carried on extensively in the district
of Mudgee, the climate of that particular
locality conferring special advantages. At
this time it became necessary to draw the
attention of English manufacturers to the
superior quality of colonial wool, and Mac-
arthur having arrived in England with specimens
taken from his finest sheep, suoh a favourable
impression was made that arrangements were
entered into for opening up a regular trade
between Australia and the mother country. The
following tabulated statement shows the progress
made in sheep-breeding since the separation of
Queensland.
f Macarthur is credited with having been
the first to actively interest himself in what ulti-
mately proved to be a profitable investment, by im-
Sorting a small number of select rams and ewes of
panish breed, from the flock given as a present to
the Dutch Government by the then King of Spain.
That the squatter’s lot has not been always a
very happy one is fully borne out by reading the
painful returns showing the losses from drought
and other causes which occurred in the years
1876-7 ; and again in 1881-2-3-4, when bad seasons
followed each other in dismal sequence.
The following figures show the losses during
those years, not only through death, but through
the anticipated increase from lambing:—
Loss through Seasons.
1876 „ „ 1.999,000
1877 6,550,000
1881 .. 1,753,000
1882 „ „ 2,274,000
1883 „ „ 1,392,000
1884 .. .. 8,138,000
From 1882 to 1891 the number of sheep im-
ported and exported, are thus given in Mr.
Ooghlan’s work :
It will thus be seen that our exports reached their
highest figure in 1890, and dropped fully 45 per
cent, the following year.
It may not be out of place here to give a com-
parative statement showing the number of sheep
in each of the Australasian provinces at the end
of 1891
From these returns it will be seen that N.S.
Wales is far ahead of the other provinces in the
breeding of sheep. And it must not be forgotten
that, while Victoria’s resources in this direction
are well nigh exhausted, N.S. Wales has yet an
almost boundless tract of land available for the
purpose. The Queenslanders seem to take more
interest in the breeding of cattle than sheep,
while South Australians find cultivation of the
soil for the production of cereals a more congenial
occupation.
It is now necessary to take a retrospective
glance in order to trace the commencement of
another great industry immediately connected
with wool-growing, and that is wool-broking.
As near as it is possible to ascertain, it is about
fifty years since Mr, Mort held the first great
public sale of wool in an unpretentious building
close to the premises at present occupied by
Richardson and Wrench. The catalogue was a
small one, but it was the initiation of an uninter-
rupted series of auction sales, which have expanded
from year to year with such enormously increasing
success that they now realise annually several
million pounds in value. From 1870 to iB9l there
has been a gradual decline in the quantity of wool
grown in this province, but shipped through out-
side ports—the proportion iqthe former year being
fully 46 per cent., whereas in the latter it was
only 28.
The marked reduction in the scale of freights
during recent years has developed a tendency to
export in the greasy in preference to the scoured
state. An interesting table has been prepared
showing the average weight of fleeces between the
years 1880 and 1891, which give the following
particulars.
When the importance of the wool-clip is taken
into consideration, the fluctuations in the state of
the market must necessarily be a matter of serious
import to those whose interests are affected. One
extract more from Coghlan, showing the quantity
and value of the exports from 1860 to 1891, and
the writer has done with statistics. The quanti-
ties given represent greasy ancfscoured together;—
Contrasting the year 1884 with 1886, it will be
observed that while the quantities exported were
nearly equal, yet the value realised in the former
year exceeded that of the latter by <£1,924,504,
a very serious difference resulting from a fluctuat-
ing market. The rapidly-increasing business of
the local auction mart soon convinced Mr. Mort
that he was not destined long to hold undisturbed
possession of the field as a woolbroker. Other
firms quickly came into existence, and warehouses
sprung up like mushrooms along the water’s edge.
To the inquiring and observant traveller who
visits Sydney at this season of the year, a most
remarkable sight presents itself in the almost
ceaseless traffic in wool between the railway-
station and Circular Quay, filling the majestic
row of colossal stores erected for its reception,
pending arrangements for its final shipment to
the various factories of Europe and America. The
latest additions to this formidable array of build-
ings are the produce store, Circular Quay, and the
wool stores, Margaret-street, completed by Messrs.
M'Burney, Wallis & Co., to whose connection
with the wool-trade of the province the remainder
of this sketch will be devoted.
About 30 years ago, Mr. M'Burney entered the
establishment of Mr. Mort as an office junior, and
from the first gave undoubted indications that he
possessed business qualities of a more than
ordinary character. The fact that he continued
in their employment until about six months
ago, advancing by rapid stages until he reached
the responsible position of auctioneer is a record
worthy of emulation. He could not have
been trained in a better school, and the thousands
with whom he came into contact during this
lengthy period are only too pleased to testify to
his uniform courtesy, commercial knowledge, and
general business capacity. Nor is it amongst the
wool-trading community alone that he has made
his mark. In the district of North Sydney, where
he has resided for many years, he took an active
part in municipal affairs and twice was honoured
by being elected to the mayoral chair. On one of
those occasions he was the recipient of a hand-
some presentation by the ratepayers in the form
of a gold watch-and-chain, a graceful souvenir of
his unsparing devotion to his responsible duties.
In 1887, several firms formed themselves-into
what is now called the Woolbrokers’ Association,
the main purpose of which, it may be assumed,
was the protection of mutual interests, A uniform
scale of commission charges was agreed upon, but
a number of brokers, while adopting the same
tariff, declined to join the organisation, preferring
to conduct their business with a free hand. A few
years later a conflict which lasted six weeks arose
between the associated brokers and the buyers, in
consequence of the latter being compelled to pay
a delivery-charge of one eighth of a penny per lb.
The brokers were victorious in the contest, but
generously conceded to purchasers an extension in
the time required for payment. At the com-
mencement of the present season another friction
occurred between the same contending parties
which threatened to produce disastrous conse-
quences, but after repeated parleyings a compro-
mise was effected which left matters pretty much
as they were.
When Mr. M'Burney severed his connection,
some months ago, with his old firm, two other
gentlemen, Mr. E. S. Wallis and Mr. A. Henson,
who for 15 years were companions in the same
establishment, joined him in partnership, and
under the name of M'Burney, Wallis and Co.,
now carry on the business of woolbrokers and
produce salesmen on their own account. Messrs.
Wallis and Henson also rose from a very modest
beginning to very responsible positions in the
counting-house of Mort and Co., and by their
amiability and industry won for themselves the
admiration of their principals and the esteem and
friendship of those with whom they came into
business relationship.
The new firm’s stores are capacious and lofty,
and they have adopted some novel and decided
improvements for expediting the receiving and
delivering of wool. In addition to hydraulic
lifts and whips, self-acting shoots have been
erected which can despatch as many as 25 bales
per shoot every five minutes. There are two
entrances in Napoleon-street for receiving, and
three exits in Sussex-street for delivering. ’They
hold tri weekly sales of skins, hides, tallow &c
at their stores, Circular Quay. The members of
the firm are assisted by Mr. D. Booth (for 12
years with Mort and Co.) in making the neces-
sary arrangements for conducting the sales. His
experience should qualify him for the position
Prior to his Australian career he conducted large
spinning works for his father in Yorkshire and
also acted as buyer.
Messrs. M'Burney, Wallis, and Co. are now
fairly IciuiiohGfl on their bold and enterprising
undertaking, and evidences are daily forthcoming
that predict for them a prosperous future, but not
greater than they justly deserve. It required no
small amount of nerve to face the formidable com-
petition at present existing in the trade, but
relying on their long business experience and on
numerous assurances of support, they have
determined, by zealous devotion to the interests
of their constituents, to achieve success. And in
this resolve they carry with them the best wishes
of every admirer of pluck and enterprise.

The Pathway of the Sun.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Do you hear the West a-calling, brother mine ?
Do you hear the West a-calling, sweet and
low ?
’Tis the voice that ever calls in shade or shine,
In madness or in gladness or in woe.
’Tis the voice that through eternity and time
On the strong soul of a man lays its behest,
And the burden of its ever-beating rhyme
Is “Ever to the Westward lies man’s quest!”
In the West the prize is waiting for the bold ;
In the East the days are dead and life is done;
And the banners of the sky are red and gold,
That beckon to the Pathway of the Sun.
Do you hear the West a-calling, brother mine ?
It is calling as it called in olden days.
Voices float across the rolling plains of brine,
And rise from out the mighty water-ways :
“ Come, ye rovers ! Come from lands all stark
and cold,
Whither lands of promise open to the view ;
For the Eastward is the grave of all things old,
But the Westward is the cradle of the new !”
Lo, the hearts of men are filled with fierce un-
rest ;
Behind, above, the skies are dark and dun ;
Their life seems but the shadow of a jest;
And they turn them to the pathway of the
sun.
In the dim and mist-hid centuries agone,
Where the Pamir greets the wide, blue Asian
sky,
And the snowy Himalayas look upon
The broad Five Rivers ever rolling by,
The Aryan tiller through the summer days
Heard wind-borne voices from the Caspian
plain ;
His soul was filled with wonder and amaze,
And a longing that might ne’er be stilled
again.
The shining share became a flaming sword,
The blazing banner of red war was spun ;
And waiting Europe knew him for her lord
As he marched upon the pathway of the sun.
The purple sails of Tyre and Sidon flecked
The levels of the Midmost Sea, and pressed
Beyond the frowning Pillars, for they recked
Of the wonders in the Islands of the Blest.
O’er the sea and o’er the land the legions went
From where on Rome look down the
Apennines,
And their crimson steps of conquest westward
bent
To the sunlit valleys of Iberian vines,
And the steppes that meet the fertile Euxine
shore
Felt the onward tread of Ottoman and Hun ;
They had heard the voice that summons ever-
more
The rover to the pathway of the sun.
When Isabel was queen in fair Castile,
Came the voices on the billow and the breeze.
And the gray Atlantic clove before the keel
That bore the lion-hearted Genoese.
From the Douro’s valley Colon’s doing led
Twin lords of war and rapine in his wake:
Weak Montezuma’s empery was sped,
When Cortes saw the City of the Lake ;
The gentle Inca kissed Pizarro’s sword,
And before him rich Peru was all undone ;
And Spain became the tyrant and the lord
Upon the glowing pathway of the sun. j.
Weird wonder-tales and ocean legends tell
Red records of the cruel Spanish years ;
How Panama, a pearl of cities, fell
To Morgan and the reiving buccaneers ;
How sea-dogs of Queen Bess their sails unfurled,
Strong men who ever fought and never feared;
How, captained by the Treasure of the World,
Down in the Main they singed the Spaniard’s
beard.
Ye know them, England’s bravest and her best;
Ye tell their names with pride, one after one—
Drake, Gilbert, Raleigh, Hawkins and the rest,
Who sailed upon the pathway of the sun.
But half a hundred years have joined the dead
Old 3-ears, since, where the white Sierras
loom,
The Californian foot-hills knew the tread
Of them that sink the shaft and build the
flume.
Our hearts, like theirs, are dry with drouth of
gold,
As Yilgarn and Pilbarra yield their store ;
And Coolgardie still is calling to the bold,
And they answer as their fathers did of yore.
Lo, Gabo signs to Borda, as they go;
Their white sails gleam as past the Bight
they run ;
Their path the Lioness and Rottnest know ;
They are marching on the pathway of the
sun.
The knell of all things dead again is knolled
To-day, as it was knolled in days that were,
And the dole that ever was to seekers doled
Is the dole again of them that do and dare.
We are born of dust that unto dust returned ;
We are seed of ashes that to ashes went;
As the embers old, so embers now are burned ;
As the dust of old, so dust is ever spent.
For aye and ever man his way shall wend
Where gold and glory wait him to be won,
Shall follow still the voice that has no end,
That calls him to the Pathway of the Sun.
Melbourne.
STEELE GREY.
Below.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Mr. George Spooner’s mate had given him due
and proper warning.
“ Better put a couple of props in before you
knock down that wash, Geordie,” he said. “ She’s
es rotten es an egg, an’ if them head in’s come
away you’ll need buryin’ between two laths, I’m
thinkin’.”
Cadwell knocked off at crib-time with the pre-
meditated intention of going up to the township
and getting gloriously drunk. This was a pleasant
little peculiarity of Cad’s. When the prompting
was strong upon him he honoured it, not by drift-
ing from one nobbier to another into unintentional
inebnaticp, but by setting aside half a day to the
duty, and “ liquoring up ” with judicial delibera-
tion.
Spooner did not put in the timber as directed.
He knew that the gravel had a deceitful way of
dropping unexpectedly in half-ton patches, but
Geordie traded on his magnificent indifference to
dangerous ground. He had never met Death face to
face, and felt the cold, iron hand of the Destroyer
clutching at his heart, and he prided himself on
his contempt tor the unknown. When, after some
particularly asinine exhibition of foolhardiness on
his part, the older miners stigmatised him, between
drinks, as a hare-brained idiot, Geordie felt con-
siderably flattered.
Cadwell and Spooner were working the shallow
alluvial at Gridiron Lead. The dirt at Gridiron
was not particularly rich, but it was pleasant
work, facing-in the soft, dry, pipeclay bottom,
and skimming off about nine inches of the wash
behoved to be the only payable gravel. Besides,
the lead was patchy and occasionally rewarded
the fidelity of the few diggers who preferred un-
c rtunty and independence in the shallow ground
to nine shillings a shift, and submission to the
Cousin Jack bosses at the deep, wet mines across
the creek, by yielding a few barrow-loads of stuff,
rich in nuggets, and good for an ounce to the
bucket, perhaps. True, these patches were like
the proverbial angels’ visits, but man loves “ a
gamble,” and the mates persisted, although for
weeks they had “ knocked out ” little more than
tucker and drinks.
On going below after crib, Mr. Spooner saw
that there were no props down, and resolved with
his usual, boasted indifference to “let her slide.”
On top, the day was wet and cold, below was dry
and warm. He would timber-up before knocking
off; meanwhile, as there was plenty of stowage
behind, he could put in the afternoon very com-
fortably. Geordie set to work, and broke down
the wash that was hanging, and shovelled it away
towards the shaft. Then he began driving under
the gravel, and stowing the pipeclay back in the
worked-out ground.
The workings were just high enough to allow of
a man using the pick comfortably on his knees.
The face was about 12 feet in extent, and a candle
in a spiked holder which was thrust into the wall
on Spooner’s right hand encircled him in a soft,
yellow light, but all beyond was in heavy shadow.
Just behind the digger there was an untimbered
space about six feet square. The roof was held
in other places by short, upright logs about seven
inches in diameter, having stout cap-pieces across
the top, wedged up to the gravel with chocks.
For more than three hours Spooner plied his
pick-and-shovel in a leisurely manner; then he
squared the face, and presently went up the shaft
for logs. He knew that if the ground were left
as it was, in all probability he and Cadwell would
have to waste half a shift next day in clearing up
after a fall, and, though professedly indifferent to
the danger of working away from the timber, he
hated unnecessary exertion. Geordie dropped
two prepared “soldiers” to the bottom of the
shaft, and slid down the rope again. When he
placed the first prop in position, he noticed that
his candle was almost burnt out, and lit another.
He then jammed the end of the “ cap ” between
the top of the log and the gravel roof, and stretch-
ing himself upon his back prepared to drive the
glab home with the head of a pick. The second slab
lying upon the floor of the workings afforded him
a pillow. This was merely accidental. The
digger struck the “cap” a smart blow, and it
sprang up against the roof as if leverage had been
applied at the other end, and then, for the first
time, Spooner stared in the face of Death, and
felt the full horror of the thing.
The headings moved.
The ground did not come away with a pre-
cipitate drop as usual—it seemed to slide a little.
The new prop had just nipped it, but had not
sufficient grip to hold, and being on a slant it
came with the fall. Resting on his back Spooner
took in every detail, saw the gravel crumbling
about the timber, and the log, with the thick slab
pinched at right angles to it, coming over towards
him. The catastrophe, he thought, was a long
time happening, and yet he had not time to move
to escape. There came a crushing, choking sen-
sation, all the blood in his body seemed to rush in
a flood to his head and strike upon Ins brain with
the force of a torrent, a sharp agony shot through
his eyeballs, he tried to cry out, but the gravel
got into his mouth and silenced him. Then he
felt a stunning blow on the head, and uncon-
sciousness followed.
When Spooner recovered his senses, he found
himself pinned to the floor and incapable of move-
ment. The log was over his left arm and above
his chest; the slab lay across him from the right,
one end had ploughed its way into the pipeclay,
the other was wedged against the end of the log.
The timber had thus served to break the weight
of the fall, but a pile of gravel pressed upon him
from his breast to his ankles, and made breathing
an effort. His right arm, in addition to the dirt
that covered it, was caught under the handle of
the pick close to the head, which had been driven
to the eye into the ground. Spooner judged, as
he was still alive, that the fall had not been a
heavy one. He shook the gravel from his face,
and made an effort to free his limbs, but the
struggle was futile, and he desisted. Little
streams of blood were trickling from outs on his
face and head, there was a numbness in one of his
legs, and his head, buried to the ears, was hurt by
the hard slab beneath; but the miner did not feel
that his position was very serious, and told him-
self that he would be all right if help came soon.
Moore or Carter, who were working a little
further up the lead, would be sure to give him a
call at four o’clock, and it was near that now.
Meanwhile he could be cool; it would not do, after
all his professions of recklessness, to let them
think that he was a bellowing coward when the
pinch came. He even rehearsed a nonchalant
cynicism with which to surprise the boys when
they came to dig him out.
One candle had been extinguished by the rush
of air, the other was still burning. Something
had fallen into the melted fat, and now acted as a
second wick, and the increased flame lit up the
open space with a brilliant glow.
Spooner, crushed upon his back, waited, strain-
ing his ears to catch any sound that might come
from the shaft. His eyes were fixed upon the
headings above, attracted by some peculiarity in
the gravel, and for a time he saw without realis-
ing ; his senses responded vaguely and reluctantly
and then the imprisoned man uttered a loud shout
of joy. Directly above him, embedded in the
headings, with a jagged end pointing towards the
centre of his forehead, was an immense nugget,
clean, yellow, dazzling. “ Seven hundred ounces
if a grain,” Geordie estimated, when the first fever
of excitement had subsided.
The flake of gravel that stunned Spooner had
left this magnificent treasure bare. The prisoner
feasted his eyes upon it; he forgot his danger and
pain, and even speculated at some length on the
joys the gold would bring him, in which specula-
tions the demure, brown-faced girl, whose portrait
was under his pillow at the hut, was always the
central figure. The nugget was almost entirely
exposed, and hung in a hole in the roof; had his
arm been free he might have touched it with his
finger-tips.
Suddenly, as Spooner gazed, his expression
altered to one of horror, his tongue became dry
and swollen in his mouth almost in a moment, and
his heart thumped at his imprisoned ribs with
quick, distinct, reverberating blows. The nugget
had fallen forward in the hole, in the side of
which it hung. It dropped fully an inch, grating
against the gravel, and shedding sand and tiny
pebbles on the face of the man below. Spooner
closed his eyes, a great sickness seized him, and
all his nerves shrank in an agony of expectation.
If that mass of gold fell, it would crush his skull
like a hazel-nut. He struggled desperately to
release himself, and cried aloud again and again.
Then another dread seized him, and he shrieked.
It must be late —the men had forgotten him I
When at length George Spooner ventured to
open his eyes again, the nugget was poised above
him, menacing and dreadful. He glared at it like
a man in a horrible dream. There was something
malignant in its yellow sheen, and its gnarled
surface had assumed the appearance of a fiendish
face, repulsive and threatening. Twice he thought
he saw it move again. A pain as of a deep wound
attacked him in the centre of the forehead, and
burned like fire ; everywhere else he was cold and
numb. A few grains of gravel, not bigger than
wheat, dribbled down upon his cheeks and brow
and stung him like molten metal, and, at each
touch, his heart bounded against the dead wall of
wash piled upon his ribs with a mighty shock.
The light went out, and Spopner was left staring
upwards into the darkness, dense and ominous.
He remembered lighting a whole candle just
before four o’clock. Great God ! It was mid-
night ! He shrieked again at the thought, but
the gravel pattered on his face in answer, and he
became dumb, trembling violently under the great
weight that held him down.
Long he lay, gazing upwards, straining his eyes
to penetrate the blackness that enveloped him,
and suffering an agony of apprehension that never
abated. Was the night interminable? He tried
to calculate the hours he had lain there, but his
mind was in revolt. The pain in his head in-
creased to unimaginable torture ; his brain seemed
frozen, and a thousand times he felt the nugget
crushing his skull against the slab on which it
rested. Every faculty was now concentrated upon
the yellow fiend now menacing him in the dark-
ness, and still ever and anon it dropped a tiny
pebble upon his face, that his mind might not
stray from the horror of it, nor a ray of hope find
its way to his shrinking soul. His quivering
nerves seemed to shake the ground about him. He
listened with agonised intensity, and the fear upon
him turned to a frenzy as his ears caught a grating
sound, a faint indication of movement in the
headings.
Then came a blinding shock, and Spooner was
dead. His jaw fell, his eyes were fixed in their
last wild stare, and in the centre of his forehead
lay a small stone not bigger than a walnut. The
nugget still hung above him, embedded in the
gravel.
“ Hello ! below there ! Are you goin’ t’ knock
off t’day?”
Moore was calling. It was 4 o’clock.

EDWARD DYSON.
“The Humour of It !”
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Mrs. Heron came home from the township and
found her husband standing by his horse —
whistling, but impatient.
“Now, Polly, a kiss and goodbye! I’ve got
my work cut out to catch the Melbourne coach,
and I’ve got to call at the bank first, too.”
Mrs. Heron coldly gave the required valedic-
tion. “What did Frank Armstrong want with
you ?” she asked.
Heron stared. “Armstrong? How did you
know he’d been here?”
“ Because you were whistling * When we were
boys together.’ You always do that when you’ve
been talking to Armstrong.”
“Gad! I believe you’re right. What a sharp
little woman it is !” and Heron laughed as he
climbed into the saddle.
No answering smile came to his wife’s hard,
handsome face. “ What did he want ?” she asked
again. “To borrow money, wasn’t it?”
“ Bull’s-eye again, Mrs. H. ! Though how you
guessed it —but, never mind, it’s between Frank
and me. We’re the same as brothers, you know!”
“Ay, I know. You were ‘boys together,’
weren’t you ?”
“ Why, you know we were, Polly ! What makes
you ask that, now ?”
“ Never mind. Don’t lend him any money!’’
“ Why not ? Think he won’t pay me, eh ?”
“ N—yes, that’s it!”
“ Oh, I’ll chance that. You see he’s never done
any good here, and never will, so he wants to
make a fresh start in the States. If he can pay
me, well and good; if not, he’s welcome to the
money for old time’s sake. See?”
“ I see; yes, I see that you’re a foo—fine fellow,
Tom Heron. But still I say, don’t lend Frank
this money. For God’s sake, don’t!” and Mrs.
Heron laid a hand on the pommel of the saddle.
“ God’s sake, no less ! Why, what the deuce is
all this? You’re out of sorts, little woman, and
don’t know quite what you’re talking about!”
She snatched her hand impatiently away. “Re-
member you were warned !” she said, and left
him.
Heron took a foot out of the stirrup, then put it
back again. “What’s the use?” he said to him-
self. “ Strange humours she gets lately ! Soon
pass, though; and, anyhow, old Franky’s got to
have this money. Making of him, very likely !’
Then he galloped into Gumboolah, drew a cheque,
put the money to Armstrong’s credit, scribbled
him a note to say so, and took the coach for Mel-
bourne.
In Swanston-street, three days afterwards, he
passed close to a man and a woman he knew very
well. He didn’t see them, but they saw him, and
breathed hard till he turned the corner.
When he got home a week later he found a note
from his wife. She had started for San Francisco
with—Frank Armstrong ! “You were warned,
she wrote, “ but you are a good fellow, and there-
fore a fool. Armstrong isn’t fit to black your
boots; but, then, I love him, and I never loved
you. There is no more to be said.”
And there wasn’t I
CAPRICOMUS.


THE DECEASED POOLER
,V.-I ,LY ix weeks ago, Scooner and
IW t'ottleby were the two most de-
pressed persons in that chosen
home of depression, the city of Melbourne.
And they looked, if possible, even more dismal
than they felt. Cheerfulness fled at their
approach, and gaiety was turned to gloom. They
carried about with them a clammy atmosphere of
despondency which caused the thoughts of every-
body with whom they talked to dwell upon coffins,
and worms, and wet graves in lonesome, neglected
cemeteries. Soooner and Pottleby were, in fact,
more than mere sufferers from the Depression ;
they were the Depression personified —in two
different styles.
Scooner was a tall, gaunt, lantern-jawed indi-
vidual with a lugubrious visage and a sepulchral
voice. You thought of famine the moment you
saw him. Pottleby was constructed on the
opposite plan. He was short, thick-necked, and
red-nosed, with protruding eyes, which looked as
if they were stewing in their sockets and per-
petually on the point of boiling over. As you
walked with him along the street you ever dreaded
that his eyes would fall out before you, and that
on treading upon them you would meet with the
fate of him who walks upon a banana-skin.
Scooner was a walking effigy of thirst.
These two curious characters were always to be
seen together—or if not together they were looking
for one another. Sometimes they went about the city
in company with Pooler —when Pooler had any
money and found it impossible to escape from
them. Pooler was a hotel-broker by profession.
# • *
One afternoon, just six or, perhaps,
seven weeks ago, they met in Bourke-street, as
per arrangement made the day before, in order to
carry out a series of strategical movements, the
objective point of which was Pooler. Pooler,
they had learnt, was going to make a commission
that afternoon on the sale of a beer-engine for
which he had been vainly trying to find a pur-
chaser ever since last Easter. He was to meet his
expected customer at a certain hotel in one of the
side streets, and they meant to be on the spot at the
psychical moment when the drinks were about to
be ordered, after the sale was concluded.
But chance occasionally
upsets the calculations of
the most skilful generals,
and when Scooner and
Pottleby arrived at the hotel,
Pooler was a half - hour
corpse." He had sold his
beer-engine without having
to talk himself hoarse over
its good qualities, and the
shock of the surprise had
been too much for him. He
fell on the floor in a fit, from
which he never recovered,
though every effort was made
to resuscitate hi m. The
landlord of the hotel even
went the length of pouring
a gill of whisky from his
own private bottle down his
(Pooler’s) throat, and knelt
besidehim for several minutes
awaiting results. But there
were none, and, with a heavy
B >gh, the good-natured Boni-
face arose, and said solemnly
to a group of his awe-stricken
patrons, who stood around
with pewters in their hands, “Gentlemen, this
settles the matter ; he’s dead as a door-nail !”
“ What makes you so sure of that ?” inquired a
man who had been filling his pockets with biscuits
from the box on the counter while the attention
of the publican was concentrated on the mortal
part of Pooler.
“ Because, sir,” was the reply, delivered in a
tone of grave severity, “ I have known Mr. Pooler
tor years, and I never till now saw him take one
drink of whisky without wanting another. The
fact that he doesn’t show any signs of wanting a
second drink at the present moment is to me con-
clusive evidence that he is dead.”

Scooner and Pottleby stood gazing sadly
on the remains of their late friend, which were laid
out on the billiard-table.
“We came too late,” said Scooner,
in hollow tones, glancing in the
direction of the bar.
Pottleby made no reply, bub the
palpitation of a vein at the end of
his nose showed that he was plunged
in deep thought.
He was, in fact, at that moment
in labour with the Great Idea
which, when pub into practice,
made such a surprising alteration
in the fortunes of himself and his
companion.
“What is it?” asked Scooner,
after waiting several minutes in
respectful silence for his mate to
speak.
“ Pooler living,” replied Pottleby,
“ was worth many drinks to us,
but Pooler dead,” here he winked
with profound meaning, “isas good
as a gold-mine to us if we work
him properly.”
“ How ? ” enquired Soooner.
Pottleby whispered in his ear.
Then they shook hands over the
remains of Pooler.
From that instant Scooner and
Pottleby became Ghouls.
« # *
I met them in the street about
a week after the funeral of
Pooler. They were dressed in
handsome black broadcloth suits
and wore tall silk hats encircled
by bauds of crape about half a foot deep.
The change in their appearance was so
great that I hardly knew them again. It was
not confined to their clothes, however. The ex-
pression on their faces had changed. It was no
longer morose and melancholy, though by no means
obtrusively cheerful. They were evidently in
mourning for somebody or something. Later on
I learnt it was Pooler, and for the first time heard
the details of his death as recorded above.
“But what,” I asked, “do you fellows mean
byparading around thecityin this funereal fashion?
You can’t bring Pooler to life again by making
ghastly exhibitions of yourselves.”
“ Better tell him everything,” said Scooner to
Pottleby.
But just at this moment a man came by who
had known poor old Pooler pretty intimately
while ho was alive—which was not so wonderful,
seeing that the man was a publican.
Then commenced a performance which, regarded
as pure acting, the present writer has never seen
surpassed.
Scooner led off after greetings had been ex-
changed with the newcomer, by pretending to
brush away angrily—as if annoyed at his own
weakness—a tear from his eyelashes. It was a
beautiful touch.
“ You heard about poor old Pooler, I suppose?”
he began.
The publican nodded affirmatively and sympa-
thetically.
“ Well” (with sudden tragic pathos, pointing to
Pottleby), “there stands the man that buried him.
If it hadn’t been for Pottleby ”
“ You needn’t make a song of it, Scooner,” inter-
rupted the latter, in the gruff tone of a man too
modest to stand by and listen to his own praises
being chanted. “ I only did what any friend of
poor old Pooler (they always spoke of him in these
terms) would have done if he had been in my
place. ”
And then, with a sob in his throat, Pottleby
went on to tell how he had had to go to an under-
taker and become personally responsible for the
funeral expenses—Pooler having been a single
man without relatives in this country —-and how
the undertaker was pressing for immediate pay-
ment of his bill.
“And so,” he concluded, “I’m trying, with the
help of Mr. Scooner, to raise the amount among
the people who knew Pooler when he was alive.
Lord knows, I’d be only too glad to pay the
money myself if I could, but the fact is I haven’t
got it. Scooner, just show Mr. your book.”
Scooner produced from his breast pocket a
penny account-book, and handed it to his com-
panion. “ You’ll see there,” said the latter, pass-
ing it to the publican, “ a list of the subscriptions
we have collected already.”
The publican, after a glance at the list, gave
Pottleby half-a-sovereign, and had his name duly
entered.
“You can join m? h a drink now, I suppose,”
he said, moving in too direction of the nearest
hotel.
“Yes,” Pottleby replied, solemnly, “to kia
memory.”
I saw them again about a month later. They
were still collecting subscriptions for Pooler’s
funeral.
“But,” I remarked, “you should have obtained
enough by this time to pay for the burial of a
regiment of hotel-brokers.”
“You forget,” said Scooner, gravely, “you
forget the expenses of collection.”
“ It’s terribly dry work,” observed Pottleby.
I ventured to suggest that, as they had gone into
it in such a systematic fashion, it might be a good
idea for them to have a few score cards printed—
something like the following
SCOONER & POTTLEBY,
Dealers in the late Pooler.
“You might,” I added, “ work the thing up into
a lucrative business. There should be a fine field
for funeral-agents in Melbourne for years to come.
Lots of people are now hanging on to life who
would be glad to die if they could make sure of
being buried decently.” They thanked me for
the suggestion and left hurriedly to interview an
old friend of Pooler whom they saw crossing the
street two blocks away.
The last time I met them was not more than a
week ago. They were driving down the street in
a buggy.
“ What’s the game now ?” I asked.
“ Oh, just the same—Pooler’s funeral,” replied
Pottleby, carelessly flicking a fly off the horse’s
ear with his whip.
“ Do you mean to say Pooler isn’t worked out
yet?” I enquired, in a tone of astonishment,
“ Worked out!” exclaimed Soooner, with more
than equal astonishment, “why, we’ve hardly
made a start on him yet. We’re now,” producing
a new subscription-book, about four times larger
than the former one, “going to canvass the
Western district; Pooler was well-known in that
part of the province.”
“ And then ?” I inquired.
“Oh, then,” he answered, airily, “we might
work through to South Australia, or, perhaps,
strike towards the Murray and cross over into
New South Wales. But you must excuse us, old
boy; we’re in a hurry. Business is business,
you know, and waits for no man. ”
They actually called this ghastly occupation
“ Business!”
And went about it in a buggy !
I stood watching them till the buggy disap-
peared around a corner, my mind filled with many
and curious thoughts.
Scoonerand Pottleby will, in my opinion, do
nothing but collect subscriptions to pay for
Pooler’s funeral till they die.
The strangest part of the affair is to come, how-
ever.
I saw Pooler two days ago in the back parlour
of the hotel in which he was supposed to have
dropped dead.
He was heavily disguised in drink and a false
beard, but I knew him again by his peculiar
hiccough.
“ One must live,” he said, seeing that I recog-
nised him, “ and I’ve been able to live better as a
dead man than I have for years past as a living
one. Scooner and Pottleby and I are in partner-
ship in this business. I’m the sleeping—or, per-
haps, I should say, the dead partner.”
I have, however, a fancy that the firm is practi-
cally dissolved.
I don’t think that Scooner and Pottleby will
ever return from their tour in the Western
district.

AT SUNSET
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Let me alone, a dull weight weighs my breast,
The old dead day dips down against the West,
The old dead day and I have need of rest.
There is a weight of lead about my feet,
About my brow the hot pulsations beat,
And in my heart a slow, consuming heat.
There is a trail of blood along the sky,
The worn day’s life goes out in one long sigh,
And one lone star looks on with trembling eye.
So, to the soul that burns its pent-up fire,
Comes there an end of all its days of dire—
An end of all its wistful vague desire.
An end of all its fever and its fret,
When life grows darker for this great regret,
That one has lived at all, and yet—and yet.
I had a hope, apd in that hope have toiled,
I had a faith, and in that faith am foiled,
I had a dream, and all my life was spoiled.
Here, as the last faint ray out yonder wings,
And the slow wind like restless water swings,
I swear there is but dust beneath all things.
And who that looks for Love must fight Despair,
And who that looks in vain must needs beware :
The lie of all things fronts him everywhere.
Death is not more than this, whate’er it hold,
Nor all the ills the after-years enfold—
Lo ! I am tired at heart, as one grown old.

THE Matchmaker
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Ned Carson’s wife was naturally a matchmaker.
She was very happy in her married life, and tried
unceasingly to give her few old friends similar
felicity. Two of her protegees had married fairly
well, principally because of her successful coach-
ing, and now only Alice Harvey remained single.
Alice Harvey was a short-statured, meek spirited
woman of 30 —just a couple of years younger than
Mrs. Carson.
Miss Harvey had, and has, a supreme admiration
for man, and believes that he has been appointed
by the Deity especially to be woman’s master.
Miss Harvey is one of those “doggy” women
who are never so happy as when they are ordered
about by men, save, perhaps, at times when the
men of their choice are beating them.
Mrs. Carson was the very antithesis of her
friend. She liked commanding—very probably it
was on this account that she took delight in hook-
ing good matrimonial fish for her less assertive
friends.
Carson laughingly admired this match-making
spirit in his wife. “It showed she had some go
in her,” he said. And so she had, for but a few
weeks after she had stated her intention of pro-
viding Miss Harvey with an identity into which
her own might merge, “the right man” was
secured.
His name was Chambers. He was a big, florid
fellow —essentially an animal. He had no conver-
sational powers nor charms of manner, but his
great white teeth and curling hair and the other
attributes of the animal man explained his suc-
cesses with the sex that thinks with its eyes.
Mrs. Carson took him in hand with that ease
of coquettish proprietorship which is accounted so
innocent in married women. When he proposed
to Miss Harvey the little woman was so astounded
at his generosity that she actually thanked him.
• • •
The wedding was fixed for a month from
the date of the betrothal. But, strange to say,
although the necessity for generalship had de-
parted, Mrs. Carson still monopolised Chambers—
or did he monopolise her? At any rate, both were
perfectly satisfied with the monopoly, and Miss
Harvey grew rather jealous, in her own unobtru-
sive way, of her friend. It would have been well
for her had she asserted herself to some extent.
These milk-and-water women actually invite
treachery.
* « •
It was the day before the wedding-day,
and Miss Harvey went to her friend’s house to
discuss a subject of not greater nor less importance
than the wedding ceremony itself —the wedding-
dress.
Ned Carson opened the door, and she followed
him into the dainty sitting-rpom.
He was strangely silent, and had that look of
wordless misery, and shed that solitary tear of
pain that you will see in the eyes of a bullock just
after it has been speared and before the knife has
begun its work.
Alice asked timidly for “Carrie.” At the
mention of the name Carson’s rage burst from him
as water from a suddenly-opened dam.
“Don’t speak of her again!” he cried—“curse
her! She’s cleared with that brutish nigger of
yours. ”
His wound was not very deep, evidently.
Wounded honour does not talk thus. Chambers
is not a “nigger” by any means-he is simply a
very handsome, dark-haired animal who keeps his
good looks by leading a temperate life —in regard
to alcohol, at least. Somehow or other, the
Lothario, especially the Lothario who seduces his
friend’s wife, is very frequently practically a
teetotaller. How often is your sleek, shiny, physi-
cally-masterful temperance light merely a man who
puts Woman instead of Whisky into his soda-
water ?
Miss Harvey did not faint —she was too meek to
faint in a friend’s house without permission, and
she sat there like one paralysed, while Carson
rambled on, his imprecations becoming more and
more pointless, until finally he lit a cigar, drank a
huge draught of brandy, and saying, “ Curse her !
—let her go !” lapsed into silence.
While he was developing this frame of mind the
meek little woman duly recognised that her
chances of a husband were gone. Not only had
the prospective husband departed—he had taken
with him the general who might have assisted her
in achieving another. Left to herself, she felt
quite helpless. Little Alice Harvey hoped,
in a vague, disjointed way, that Carson’s wife
would return some day and take up the good work
of matchmaking where it had been dropped.
Alice thought over all these things and sighed a
little. She wanted so much to hare a master, and
no one seemed to require a slave.
Carson broke the moment’s silence. “See here,
Alice,” he said, growing more and more shame-
faced as he proceeded, “ your case is just the
same as mine. I’ve lost a wife—you’ve lost a
husband. I can’t marry you—not now, at any
rate—but I’ll stick to you. Will you stay here ? ”
She stammered and blushed—her modesty out-
raged by the proposal. And yet, here was the
first tangible offer of a master.
“It’s the best thing you can do,” said Carson,
her hesitancy making him bolder.
For answer she took off her bonnet and hung it
in the hall.
Carson lifted his wife’s letter from the table,
tore it into tiny fragments, and cast the pieces
and the memory of her into the perfumed air of
the garden.

A Gum-tree in the Desert.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
A Creek, that is to say, a depression in the
ground which began nowhere and, after a brief
course, ran out into nothing. Its one distinctive
feature amid the surrounding monotony, a low,
ancient, stumpy, scarred and twisted gum-tree, of
scantiest foliage, rusty and forlorn appearance.
A tree, large in girth but without heart, the mere
mockery of a shell.
Around, a dull level of country, neither plain
nor forest. Small belts of mulga, then clumps of
stunted shrubs, growing on arid soil sparsely
covered with spinifex and the withered stalks of
other bushes.
But beyond the proud distinction of a gum-tree,
or “yalloo,"’ as the aboriginal inhabitants of that
region would call it, the creek boasted of a more
important claim to consideration. At the foot of
the little bank, beneath the gum-tree, grew a few
dark-green reeds, wiry and short. They grew
beside a small and shallow pool of clear water, so
small that one would think a single day of the
desert sun would suck it dry. But the old gum-
tree knew better and had grown up beside the
only weak, struggling, little surface spring there
was in all that thirsty land. The water was
slightly brackish and nauseous to the taste, but
for many miles east, west, north, and south it was
the sole store Nature had provided in all that
desolate region.
The wretched little spring and the old, coreless
tree had not many visitors. At times, some of
the gaunt, meagre, ape-like denizens of the great
Western interior would camp there for a night,
halting on their journey across some wide, dry
stretch, but there was no game to tempt them to
linger. At other times parrots, pigeons, or a tired
and worn-out kite came in and drunk and rested
in the branches of the old yahoo, then hastened on
to a more promising land ; but, as a rule, the old
tree and little spring were lonely, silent, and un-
visited.
It was the time of day when the old gum-tree
cast no shadow, when the wrathful sun looked
straight down on the scorched earth, and the
earth lay pulseless and faint, that a dark object
came limping painfully through the cruel spinifex
towards the lone spring. It was a miserable old
black gin helping her thin, decrepit legs along
with a yam stick not much thinner than they. A
poor creature, abjectly bent and worn, with scaly
skin, blear eyes, and the ribs of a skeleton. How
she had missed her fellows and turned off to this
soak-hole, led by some old instinct, it would be
hard to say ; perhaps a bad cut in one of her feet
would account for it, but she came hobbling on,
until she reached the place and sank down beside
the water,
Even then she did not act as a white would
have done, and plunge her face into the mawkish)
tepid stuff ; but scraped a hole alongside for the
water to drain into through the sand ; then she
drank some sparingly, and lay there a while with
the sun beating on her poor old limbs and body,
Revived a little, she arose, went to an old camp-
ing-plaoe, and rubbed some ashes into the sore on
her foot; then, from her miserable dilly-bag, took
out some roots and a few fresh-water mussels.
This was her meal, which she vainly tried to sup-
plement by searching in the damp mud at the foot
of the bank for more mussels.
At the foot of the old tree was an aperture in
the shell about the size of the entrance to a dog-
kennel or the man-hole of a tank. Into this the
old gin crept, apparently knowing the place, and
coiled herself up to rest and sleep.
Two hours of drowsy heat, of sultry calm, of
unbroken stillness; then, through the haze that
rises with the coming of the afternoon loomed
other figures—men and horses.
Two white men, with a couple of pack-horses,
wild-eyed, with tucked-up flanks, rode towards the
old tree. Some distance away they pulled up and
one went ahead alone. When ho saw the water
he waved his hat and the other followed ; then
they hastily unpacked and unsaddled and the
thirsty horses ran down to the water. There was
not much more than room for them all to drink at
once.
“That was a stroke of luck,” said one of the
men as they stood looking at the horses, “catch-
ing sight of the old tree. You can generally bet
on a little water of some sort where a yalloo of
this kind grows.”
“Think there will be enough for them?”
“Yes, this must be a bit of a spring, for there’s
been no rain since the country was made, I
think,” and he looked significantly at the parched
surroundings.
“We had better camp here, I suppose ?”
“By Jove, yes, and spell to-morrow, too, after
such a tying-up as the mokes have had.”
“ Not much feed.”
“They’ll pick up something amongst the mulga
over there.”
By this time the horses had finished, and the
little hole was drained dry for the first time.
“ It will fill again, slowly of course, but there’s
plenty of soakage still in this bank,” said one.
They hobbled the horses, made a fire, and
camped by the old tree, which now oast a long
shadow.
Inside the trunk the quaking gin had been
awakened by their coming—had, even with her
rheumy eyes, recognised through a crack the
dreaded strangers once or twice seen before at a
distance.
Night set in, the tired men slept, but the
wretched creature could not escape even had she
had courage, for the pack-bags and saddles were-
heaped against the hole by which she had entered.
Slowly the moon rose and lit up the scene, andl
from amongst the long shadows it cast crept forth
other darker shadows, and stole towards the
camp.
Blacks, even the most abject, do not desert
their sick, old, or crippled, and some had come
back to look for the crippled gin. But the white
men were sleeping at the tree, and although, at
last, emboldened by necessity, they crept in to
drink at the water, the wretched prisoner could
not let them know of her presence, even had she
been aware of theirs. The men slumbered un-
scathed, the blacks departed ; and morning broke,
dewless and oppressive.
“Phew!” said one of the two men, “Look at
the niggers’ tracks on top of our horse-tracks.
Wonder they didn’t knock us on the head last
night.”
“Some gins, I suppose, sneaking in for water,”
returned his companion.
“ They travel at night very often in this dry
country.”
All that day the men lounged about, and the
inside of the old tree was like an oven, and the
frightened creature nearly shrieked when one with
a tomahawk commenced chopping his initials on
the outside.
Night once more, and when the moon was high
one of the men started and roused his companion.
“ What the deuce did you groan like that for?”
“Did I groan? Must have been dreaming.”
“Don’t dream like that again. I never heard;
such a groan—you ought to sell it.”
Next morning they saddled up and left, and the-
tree and the trampled spring were solitary once*
more.
It was many years after settlement of the neigh-
bouring “ available ” country that the old yalloo-
succumbed to a high wind preceding a thunder-
storm, and toppled over. And again, some time-
after that, a man from one of the stations, visiting
the spring, looked into the hollow trunk of the-
fallen tree and found an old mummy huddled up-
nose and knees together. The remains were sent-
away as a great curiosity, and an authority on
ethnology wrote a very clever paper proving that-
this method of “tree-burial” was analogous to-
that practised in many other parts of the world a*
few thousand years ago, and it exactly fixed the-
era of development arrived at by these Australian!
aborigines.

A Ghost.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Ghosts walk the Earth, that rise not from the
grave.
The Dead Past hath its living dead. We see
All suddenly, at times, and shudder, then—
Their faces pale, and sad, accusing eyes.
Last night, within the crowded street, I saw
A Phantom from the Past, with pallid face,
And hollow eyes, and pale, cold lips, and hair
Faded from that imperial hue of gold
Which was my pride in days that are no more.
That pallid face I knew in its young bloom—
A radiant lily with a rose-flushed heart—
Most beautiful, a vision of delight.
And seeing ic again, so changed, so changed,
I felt as if the icy hand of Death
Had touched my forehead, and his voice said
“ Come I”
Ah, pale, cold lips that once were rosy red !
Lips I have kissed on golden afternoons
Past, past, and gone, and gone beyond recall—
Breathing low vows beside the summer sea
(Vows broken like the breaking of a wave),
Ah, faded hair, whose curls I have caressed,,
And sworn the least of them was dearer far
Than all the wealth of all the world to me I
Ah, hollow, haunting eyes, within whose 1
depths,
Flow’r-like, and star-like, once my Fate I saw.
Or thought I saw I —is there not any way
To call back from its grave the Buried Past ?
Dear! Though my vows to thee were all
forsworn—
Too well, too late, I know I loved thee more
Than mine own life—a life-in-death since then.
Yet shall I nevermore in all the days,
And all the lives to come, if lives there be
Beyond this life, beyond the weary earth,
Kiss thee again upon the lips and hair.
And call thee by the old caressing names,
And feel thy true heart beating against mine,
That was so false and would, too late, be true;
For neither passionate prayer, nor burning
tears,
Nor incantations that might rend the rocks,
Nor all the powers of hell, nor God Himself
May raise the buried Past to life again.
For thou that wert art not; dead evermore—
Dead evermore, too, that which once was I.
What exorcism will lay these haunting ghosts ?
None but a draught of the Lethean stream.
Who drinks therefrom shall all things soon
forget,
Himself forgetting, too—the Greatest Good.
VICTOR J. DALEY.


MY ONLY MURDER
It was slm#y & choice between killing a man, and
■outraging all it'Ue finer sensibilities of my nature,
ilad I not done ithe deed I should have had to
appear in another (man’s eyes as a cold-blooded,
iselfish ingrate. I wear to you that it was to
?spare the feelings of both of us that I took upon
myself the terrible responsibility of slaying a
Ifellow-creature.
Do I regret the deed? Not at all.
Twelve years ago, I was just coming to the end
of my term of partnership in a North Queensland
station, and well pleased I was to get out of it,
for pastoral property was falling rapidly. My two
partners were not so happy over the matter. The
rate at which they were buying me out had, under
our agreement, been fixed some time previously,
and as prices had since steadily fallen they
had to pay me more than the market value.
But, then, had stations gone up, as was antici-
pated by them when the rate was agreed upon, I
should have been forced to accept less than the
market-value, so it was just the fortune of war.
I had to be up on the station by a fixed date,
the wet season had arrived, and there was not a
day to spare. If I did not attend on the date
specified for delivery, it might form a pretext for
■.the other side to repudiate their bad bargain.
'The rain came down steadily, and I knew that
■my work was cut out to reach the place in time.
•Once across the Banderoar river, I was safe, but
\when I arrived on the bank it was a swim, and
(fast rising. There was too much at stake to
Ihesitate; alligators or not I must cross. My
Ihorse could swim well, I knew, and so could I.
It was growing late, so, without more ado, I un-
dressed, strapped my clothes on the saddle,
unbuckled the reins, crossed the stirrup-leathers
in front and started.
As soon as old Hielandman (my horse) was out
of his depth and swimming straight, I slipped off
and swam alongside him. We were nearly two-
thirds of the way across when suddenly Hieland-
man struck against a submerged snag. The shock
and the strong current made me foul him, and ere
I could get clear he had clipped me on the head
with his fore-foot. I don’t remember much about
what happened immediately afterwards, only it
seemed mighty hard to drown just as I was about
to retire with a small competency and get married.
Then I felt cold, and oh ! so sick, and, after an
interval, I found myself ashore with a great
singing in my ears, and a taste in my mouth as
though I had swallowed all the flood-water in
North Queensland.
I had been pulled out by one of a party of men
camped on the bank I was making for. He had
bravely jumped in without waiting to undress,
and after being nearly drowned himself, had
dragged me ashore. He was standing by the fire,
wringing out his wet clothes, and, with the glow
of new-born life within me, I thought he was the
most glorious fellow I had ever seen.
“By Jove, old man !” he said to me cheerily,
“if I had waited to take my trousers off you
would have been feeding the alligators now. ”
I did not doubt it, and I told him how deeply
grateful I felt, and how I could never thank him
sufficiently. To die just then would have been
especially bitter, and I said so.
Hielandman had got free of the snag and swum
to land safely. Beyond the lump on my head
there was no damage done. My new friends were
a party of drovers returning from delivering a
mob of cattle. I camped with them that night,
and next morning, with a light heart, departed for
my destination. Needless to say I had assured
Jenkins, my rescuer, of my undying gratitude,
and told him that whenever he desired it my
homo should be his home and ray purse his purse.
He took it all very nicely, told me that he was
sure I would have done the same
for him, that he wanted nothing,
but, to oblige me, if ever he did
become “ stone-broke ” he would
remember my kind offer.
Twelve years elapsed. The
money I had received for my share
of the station had, by judicious
investment, turned into a nice little fortune. I was
married to a wife exactly suited to me, we had
three healthy children, and lived in good style in
one of the prettiest suburbs of Sydney. I had
often told my wife of the gallant way in which
Jenkins, whom I had never since seen, plunged
into the flooded river and rescued me, and she
as often said that it would crown the happiness of
her life to see him and thank him with her own
lips.
One day I was accosted in George-street by a
bearded and sunburnt bushman dressed in unmis-
takeable slop clothes, who seized me by the hand
and ejaculated : “But for being told, I should
never have known you. You look a different sort
of fellow to what you did when I pulled you out
of the Banderoar. By Jove, old man, had I waited
to take off my trousers you’d have been a gone
coon !’’ It was Jenkins, my preserver.
I was delighted to see him, and insisted on his
coming out to stay with me. He agreed willingly,
and I was at last able to present to my wife the
saviour of her husband. That she was disap-
pointed, I could see; but, being a good little
woman, she did not let the guest observe it.
Truth to tell, I somehow shared her sentiments. I
had, perhaps, rather overdone my description, and
had made my wife expect to see something akin to
one of Ouida’s heroes. Jenkins certainly did
show to better advantage at his own camp-fire
than in town, in his newly-creased reach-me.
downs; but we forgave all that, and made him
royally welcome. At dinner he was rather awk-
ward, and insisted on telling my wife the story of
my rescue twice over, always emphasising the fact
that, had he stopped to doff his trousers, I should
have been drowned.
From that date there commenced an ordeal
which I would not willingly—nay, one which I
could not—again endure. When Jenkins gained a
little confidence he became argumentative and
dictatorial. I am a sociable man, and my house was
a favourite with my friends ; but Jenkins sat upon
them all. He asserted his opinions loudly and
emphatically, and when unacquainted with the
place or topic under discussion, always had some
friend of the past to quote who knew all about it.
He held views on the labour troubles which were
rank heresy to my circle of pastoral friends, but
never did he hesitate to loudly assert them. And
yet he was a good fellow, evidently looking upon
me as a sort of creation of his own.
“Ah!” he would say, as we stood regarding
my pretty house, the sunny, flowering garden,
and the children playing on the lawn, “we should
never have seen this if you had gone to the
bottom of the Banderoar. If I had stopped to
take off ”
I felt this, too, and wrung his hand
in response. Perhaps that very even-
ing we had a small dinner-party, and
when I saw a demure smile steal over
everybody’s face I knew that in th'
coming silence I should hear
Jenkins describing what would
have happened had he “ stopped
to pull ”• Then, I could
have slain him. We had not
a lady friend to whom he had
not confided, in a loud voice,
that singular instance of his
presence of mind in refraining
from undressing. Those male
friends whom Jenkins had not
insulted I had quarrelled with
on account of their frivolity in
always asking me
if “Jenkins had
taken his trousers
off yet?”
But the worst
of it was that the
dear fellow really
believed that he
was affording me
the most exquisite
happiness in en-
tertaining hi m.
He was convinced
that for twelve
years I had been
pining to pay off
my debt, and that
now I was enrap-
tured. He was my shadow, and reverenced every-
thing belonging to me. How could I break this
charm by declaring that I was tired of him ? It
would have been worse than heartless.
At last my patient wife began to grow short-
tempered and restless. She told me plainly once
that Jenkins had not pulled her out of the
Banderoar, and that she did not see why she
should put up with him any longer. I tried to
point out that as she and I were one it really
amounted to the same thing, but she replied that
it certainly did not. We were not married when
it happened, and if I had been drowned she would
have married somebody else —perhaps someone
not oppressed by having barnacled to him a
devoted rescuer who was eternally advertising
that he had not taken off his trousers.
I felt that a climax neared—and that something
must be done to prevent the breaking up of my
once happy home. At times I meditated investing
a portion of my capital in a small selection some-
where and getting Jenkins to go and look after it
for me, but he expressed himself as being so con-
tented where he was, and so greatly averse to
returning to the bush, that I abandoned the idea.
Now, too, he began to indulge in sheepish flirta-
tions with the maids, and my wife sternly
requested me to “speak to your friend.” I
attempted to do so, but when I saw his mild,
affectionate eyes gazing at me, and knew that he
was thinking of the time when we struggled
beneath the muddy flood waters, without taking
off his trousers, I broke down. I could not wound
his gentle heart.
It came to me suddenly—the inspiration, the
solution of the difficulty. Jenkins must die !
Once resolved, I acted. I knew it was wrong,
but I couldn’t help it, any more than Deeming
could help killing his wives, or Mr. Neill Cream
could help poisoning all those poor girls in London.
Jenkins was a friendless bushman ; I was a man
with responsibilities and a family. Their hap-
piness stood first, and it was kinder to Jenkins to
kill him at once than to undeceive him.
I shall not enter into details as to the carrying
out of my design. Enough to say that it was
perfectly successful. I have no intention of teach-
ing the art of murder made easy. Jenkins died
peacefully and painlessly. The doctor said that
his constitution had been undermined by exposure
and hardship. When he was confined to his bed my
wife forgave him everything and nursed him with
unremittingcare. I have even seen tears in the poor
.little woman’s eyes as she murmured that she was
afraid we should lose him. Other people came
to see him, and he passed away happy in the firm
belief that he left behind him a large circle of
sorrowing friends.
I buried him in my own ground in Waverley
cemetery, and erected a neat stone with a suitable
inscription, stating that he had risked his life in
preserving me from death.
All my old friends are back again. Everybody
has told me what a manly fellow I was, and how
they admired my social pluck in not looking coldly
upon an old benefactor who did not happen to be
quite up to the Government House standard of
dress and manners. My conscience is easy.
DELCOMYN
In a party of eight sluicing a terrace
down Shoalhaven way there were in one tent a
little Scotch cook named Jamieson and a big fat
Irishman named Pat Dooley. Pat was more of a
bully than anything else, and the way he used to
“go for ’’ Scotty was painful to see. But Heaven
came to the little man’s help by sending him along
a dead black snake, washed down the river. At
night Pat went to bed and slept the sleep of the
man who can whip anybody in the camp. But in
the midnight there was a great cry heard, and the
boys, crowding in, saw Patrick squirming in
agony whilst Jamieson was employed in valorously
kicking a huge black snake into the fire. They
could see at a glance what had happened, and
knew it from Pat’s holding a part of his body where
the reptile had bitten him. Three of them having
torn away Pat’s hands and held him down, the
experienced man of the party saw the marks of
the fangs. To produce his knife and cut a huge
steak out of Mr. Dooley was the work of a
moment. Then they dosed him with
brandy and banged kerosene-tins to
keep him awake; and
when he dropped off
at last it was breath-
ing blessings on
Jamieson who had
killed the snake,
and on his mates
who had pre-
\ vented him from

in it at exactly the same distance apart as the
snake’s fangs. It was not until after he had
left that the skilful operator and his friends knew
of the trick that had been played. Pat knows
now and wants to meet Jamieson.

Natural Polygamy
Women like to see strong evidence of his sex in a
man. The more a man is prized by other women
the more does the individual woman love him.
These philosophic axioms by way of preamble.
Fifty miles from L, on the main railway-
line to S ,is a small station where the down-
train stops for half-an-hour.
On the end of the station platform a handsome
young fellow stands slowly stroking a black
moustache as he looks musingly across the lineai d
the wire-fence at the stunted gums which shimnu r
in the glorious sunshine. In their tops the joyous
magpies chorus their morning pecan. An old man
who, seated on one of the benches, waits for the
train to start, closes his world-weary eyes and
gives a deep cough.
Tom Campbell turns round—" Ha ! that s a
churchyarder ! ” Then, with a voice and manner
that shows audible self-communion to be habitual
—“ Tlie gods have been very kind t<> me."
lie walks up to the veteran, and looking down
on him with kindly eyes, addresses him. “You
are ill—would you like anything ?”
“Ah ! my lad, I’m afraid I’m cooked —I’m going
to H Hospital. Bring us a nip of brandy.”
Tom walks to the hotel at the back of the
station and returns with a flask of liquor. He
chats with the old man and presently holds out
his hand (with something in it) in farewell. As
he goes out from the platform along the bank of
the cutting leading to the station, he catches the
eye of the stationmaster’s pretty daughter looking
at him through the window. He gives her a
glance in return which makes her retreat with a
smile and a blush.
He stands, removes his soft-felt hat, pats his
chest gently, and draws a deep inspiration.
“ Ah! What a glorious day ! What a pity that
millions should be in pain and poverty ! Why
are the Fates so kind to one and so harsh to
others? I have youth, health, parents, brothers,
friends—and now, crowning bliss, my dear old
girl remains faithful and awaits me. 1 suppose
it’s affinity, mental and physical.”
He draws a telegram from his pocket and reads
for the fiftieth time these words—“ Dear old
fellow, will meet you at C.— Emily.” He
carefully replaces the telegram, extends both
arms slowly, and then as the remembrance of past
blisses comes over him, he embraces an imaginary
form. “Ah ! dear girl, dear girl.”
A most ardent lover.
From the guard-van the guard and mail-guard
eye his movements.
“Who’s that young fellow, Jim?” the young
guard enquires of the elder. “ I noticed that be
spoke to you as he got out. He must have said
something to old Jackson’s Mary as he passed her
at the window. I saw her smile.”
“Small blame to her,” croaks the elder man,
whose chief delight in life is to talk of phrenology,
magnetism, and dozens of other isms. “ Women
love strong, handsome men. It is so natural they
should. A fine fellow. Travelled a good deal up
and down a couple of years ago. Been to W estei n
Australia, I believe. He’s full of magnetism, I’ll
bet. A favourite with the women, no doubt.
Ha ! ha ! it is so natural for women to love sex in
a man. Ha !ha! so natural.”
“ Confound you !” says the young guard, good-
naturedly, “you are always talking of sex or
magnetism or something of that sort. Any)iow,
he seems a fine fellow. Sing out to him, as you
know him. Time’s up.”
Fifteen miles further down the line, in the
waiting-room at T station, are two women.
One is looking—her head leaning on her hand-
through the window at the homestead, half-a-inile
away, before which the weeping willows stand in
rows. In the flats behind the house numerous
small lagoons shine like silver in the sun, and
reflect the green ranges beyond. All is hers, yet
she pettishly turns round with a gesture of im-
patience. As yet she lacks one thing. A hand-
some, brown-eyed woman, she has looked for Love
and not found it.
The other woman walks in and out of the room
restlessly, and now and anon reads something she
keeps in her hand. “ Coming, dear girl,” it reads.
The brown-eyed woman speaks : “ You seem
very anxious.”
The reply comes with an uncontrollable im-
pulse : “ Yes !I am waiting for my boy.”
The speaker is a tall, fair-haired woman around
whose mouth the shadow of a smile seems ever
lurking.
The brown-eyed woman smiles somewhat sadly,
and says : “ I’d like to see the man who could
so excite and interest me. ”
“Wait and see him then,” replies the fair-
haired woman. “ See—here’s his portrait.” And
she draws it from her breast.
“ That is the picture of my boy. A finer fellow
does not breathe. Two years ago he went to
Western Australia. He is coming back to me, as
he always promised he would. What more can a
woman want ? For me the world holds nothing
else. lam sure you will love him, too.”
“ What is that to me ? You will not share him
with me.”
“I will I”
“ Then I’ll wait and see.”
The train comes in.
Tom Campbell steps out. His heart beats
rapidly with excess of joy, for has he not seen
through the window the face of his sweetheart ?
In the waiting-room the brown-eyed woman lays
a hand on the tall, fair woman’s left arm. She
wliispers, in a low voice: “Now, will you share
him with me ?”
“Yes,” replies the fair woman, and her blue
eyes flash with love and pride. “I knew you
would love him.”
Tlje other blushes deeply and then turns pale.
A minute later the train has steamed onward
and the platform is deserted. “ Tom !” “ Emily!”
The lovers are in each other’s arms.
“This is a friend of mine, Tom. She will go
with us to B , where we can all spend a few
weeks quietly. I want you to show her how nice
you are, dear old fellow.”
The telegraph - instrument in the station-
master’s room goes click ! click ! with a palpitat-
ing intensity, as though it had a heart which beat
in unison with the atmosphere. Pouf ! that of
the waiting-room has become positively electrical.
“ Emily, you were always a strange character,
and I fear you have too high an opinion of my
power to please your sex. Nevertheless ”
He keeps one arm around the neck of his old
love, and with the other slowly and amorously
draws the fascinated brown-eyed woman to com-
plicated embrace.
A faster and more intense click ! click ! click !
comes from the instrument.
The air is sultry.

HUNGERFORD
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
One of the hungriest “cleared roads ” in N.S.W.
runs to within a couple of miles of Hungerford,
and stops there; then you strike through the
scrub to the town. There is no “ distant pros-
pect ” of Hungerford—you don’t see the town till
you are quite close to it, and then two or three
white-washed, galvanized-iron roofsstart suddenly
out of the mulga.
They say that a past Ministry started to
clear tie road from Bourke, under the impression
that Hungerford was an important place, and
went on, with that blindness peculiar to Govern
ments, till they got to within two miles of the
town. Then they ran short of rum and rations,
and sent a man on to get them, and make
enquiries. The member never came back, and two
more were sent to find him, or Hungerford.
Three days later the two returned in an exhausted
condition, and submitted a motion of want-of-con-
fidence, which was lost. Then the whole House
wmnt on and was lost also. Strange to relate,
that Government was never missed ! But, is it
strange ?
However, we found
II anger ford and
camped there for a
day. The “town”
is right on the
Queensland border
and an interprovincial
rabbit - proof fence —
with rabbits on both
sides of it —run s
across the mainstreet.
There are two houses
and a humpy in
N.S.W., and five
houses in Queensland.
Char acteristically
enough, both the pubs,
are in Queensland.
We got a glass of
sour yeast at one of
them and paid six-
pence for it—we had
asked for English
ale.
The post-office is in
N.S. Wales, and the
police - barracks i n
Banan iland. T h e
police cannot do any-
thing if there’s a row
going on across the
street in N.S.W.,
except tosend to Bris-
bane and have an
extradition warrant
applied for ; and they
don’t do much if
there’s a row in Most of the rows
are across the border, where the pubs. are.
At least, I believe that’s how it is, though the
man who told me might have been a liar. Another
man said he was a liar, but then he might have
been a liar himself —a third person said he was
one. I heard that there was a fight over it, but
the man who told me about the fight might not
have been telling the truth. However, let it slide.
One part of the town swears at Brisbane when
things go wrong, and the other part curses Sydney.
The country looks as though a great ash-heap
had been spread out there, and mulga scrub and
fir. wood planted—and neglected. The country
looks just as bad for a hundred miles round
Hungerford, and beyond that it gets worse—a
blasted, barren wilderness that doesn’t even howl.
If it howled it would be a relief.
I relieve that Burke and Wills found Hunger-
ford, an 1 it’s a pity they did ; but, if I ever stand
by the graves of the men who first travelled
through this country, when there were no roads,
or stations, or “ tanks,” or bores, or pubs., I’ll
lil take my hat off. There were brave men in
the land in those days.
Tis said the explorers gave the district its name
chiefly because of the hunger they found,, there,
and which has remained there ever since. I don’t
know where the “ fyrd ” comes in—there’s nothing
t > ford, except in flood-time. “ Hungey-thirst ”
would have been better. The town is supposed to
be situated on the banks of a river called the
Paroo, but we saw no water there, except what
passed for it in a “tank.” The goats and sjieep
and dogs and the rest of the population drink
there. It’s dangerous to take too much of. that
water in a raw state.
Except in flood-time, you couldn’t find the bed
of the river without the aid of a spirit-level and a
long strkight-edge. There is a Custom-house
against the fence on the northern side. A pound
pf tea often costs Gs. on that you-can get
a common lead-pencil for 4d. at the rival store
across the street in the mother province. Also, a
small loaf of sour bread for a shilling,at the
humpy aforementioned. Only about 60 per cent,
of the sugar will melt.
We saw one of the storekeepers gi a deadbeat
swagman five shillings’-worth of rations to take
him on into Queensland. The storekeepers often
do this, and put it down on the loss side of their
books. I hope the recording angel,listens.
We camped on the Queensland side of the fence,
and after “ tea ” had a yarn with an old man who
was.minding a mixed flock of goats and sheep;
and we asked him whether he thought Queensland
was better than N.S.W., or v the other way about.
He scratched the back of his head, and thought
awhile, and hesitated’ like a stranger who is going
to do you a favour at some personal inconvenience.
At last, with the bofed air of a man who has
gone through the same performance too often before,
he stepped deliberately upito the fence and spat
over it into N.S. W. After which he got leisurely
through and spat back on Queensland.
“ That what I think of the blanky colonies ! ’’
ho said.
He gave us time to become sufficiently im-
pressed, then he said :
“ And if I was at the Victorian and South
Australian border I’d do the same thing.”
He let that soak into our minds, and added :
“And the same with West Australia —and—and
Tasmania.” Then he went away towards the pub.
The last would have been a long spit. And he
forgot Maoriland.
We heard afterwards that his name was
“ Clancy,” and he had that day been offered a job
of droving at “255. a week and find your own
horse.” Also, find your own horse-feed and
tobacco and soap, and other luxuries, at station
prices. Moreover, if you lost your
hive to find another, and if that died or
went astray, you'd have to find a third —or
fo feit your pay and return on foot. The boss
drover agreed to provide flour and mutton—when
such things could be found.
Consequently, Clancy’s decidedly unfavourable
opinion of the “colonies.”
Wonder whether he was “Banjo’s” Clancy,
formerly of the Overflow ?
“OUT OF THE MOUTHS OF BABES.”
1ST SMALL BOY: “ Why, look at that there kid a smoking!”
2ND SALL BOY: “If it was my young ’un, d’ye know wot I’d do?
I’d take the bide off’n un, I would!”
My m.atj and I sat down on our swags against
the fence.to talk things over, and presently a black
tracker went past juid. looked r at us, and returned
to the pub. -n a trooper in Queensland uni-
form came along and asked us what the yarn was
about, and where wo came from and were going,
and whete we camped. We said we were dis-
cussing private business, and he explained that-*
he thought it was a row, and came over to see
what it was. Then he left us, and later on we
saw him sitting with the rest of the population on
a bench under the hotel verandah. Next morning
we rolled up our swags and left Hungerford to the
north-east.

KENNEDY THE BOATST EERER
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Steering N.W, from Samoa for six or
seven hundred miles you will sight the Ellice
Group, low-lying, palm-clad coral atolls fringed
on the lee with shimmering sandy beaches. On
the weather-side, exposed to the long sweep of
the ocean-rollers, there are but short, black-
looking reefs backed by irregular piles of loose, flat
sea-worn coral, thrown up and accumulating till
its surface is brushed by the pendant leaves of the
coeoanuts, only.to be washed and swirled back
seawards when the wind comes from the westward
and sends a fierce sweeping current along the
white beaches and black coral rocks alike.

Twenty-three years ago’thes ) islands were
almost unknown to anyone save a few wandering
traders and the übiquitous Njw Bedford whaler.
*But now, long ere you can see from the ship’s
deck the snowy tumble of the surf on the reef, a
huge white mass, grim, square and ugly, will meet
your eye—white-washed walls of adistressfulghast-
liness accentuated by doors and windows of the
deadliest black. This cheerful excrescence on the
face of suffering Nature is a Native Church.
The people have mostly assimilated themselves-
in their manners and mode of life generally, to the
new order of things represented by the fearful-
looking structure aforementioned. That is to
say, even as the Tongan and Fijian, they have
degenerated from a fierce, hardy, warlike race
into white - shirted, black - coated hypocrites,
whose ideal of a lovely existence is to have
public prayer twice a day on week-days and
all day on Sundays, and get half a dollar from the
.white trader for a sick fowl —which, when bought,
will be claimed by another native, who will have
the white man fined two dollars for buying stolen
property. Had the white man paid a dollar he
had done wisely—that coin sometimes goes far in
the Tokelaus. For instance, the truly unctuous
native Christian may ask a dollar for two fowls,
but he will also lease out his wife for a similar
amount. Time was when the undue complaisance
of a married woman meant a sudden and inartistic
compression of the jugular, or a swift blow from
the heavy, ebony-wood club of the wronged man.
Nowadays, since the Dayspring from on High
hath shown them the Right Way, such domestic
troubles are condoned by—a dollar. That is, if
it be a genuine American dollar or two British
florins; for outraged honour would not accept the
cast iron Bolivian money or the poor silver of Chili
and Peru. And for a dollar the native
“Christian” can all but pay for a nicely-bound
Bible, printed in the Samoan tongue, and thus,
no doubt, out of evil would come good ; for he
cmld, by means of his newly-acquired purchase,
picture to his dusky mate the terrors that await
those who look upon strange men and tape
(bright and shining money).

But 1 want to tell about Kennedy.
Kennedy the Boatsteerer he was called ; although
twenty years had passed and gone since that day
at Wallis Island when he, a bright-eyed, bronze-
faced lad -with the fighting-blood of the old
Puritan Eudicotts running like fire through his
Veins, despite his New England bringing-up ran
his knife into a shipmate’s heart and fled for ever
from all white associations. Over a woman it
was, and only a at that; but
then she was young and beautiful, with dreamy,
gi istening eyes, and black, wavy hair, ornamented
w.th a wieath of orange-flowers and coil upon coil
of bright-hued sea s a berries strung together,
hanging from her neck and resting upon her
dainty bosom.
* * *
Standing at the doorway of his house,
looking over the placid waters at the rising sun,
Kennedy folds his brawny arms across his bare,
sun tanned chest and mutters to himself, in his
almost forgotten mother-tongue : “Twenty years,
fcventy years ago ! Who would know me there
now ? Even if I placarded my name on my back
and what I did ’taint likely I’d have to face a grand
jury for running a knife into a mongrel Portuguee,
way out in the South Seas a score of years ago.
. . . Poor little Talamalu ! I paid a big price for
her—twenty years of wandering from Wallis Island
to the Bonins; and wherever I go that infernal
follows me up. Well, I’ll risk it anyhow,
and the first chance that comes along I’ll cut
Kanaka life and drinking ship's rum and go see
old dad and mum at home. Here, Tikena, you
devil, bring me my toddy.”
A native, clad in his grass tili, takes from a
wooden peg in the house wall two shells of toddy,
and the white wanderer takes one and drinks.
H e is about to return the other to the man when
two girls come up from the beach with their arms
around each other’s waists, Tahiti fashion, and one
calls out with a lau'gh to “leave some in the
shell.” This is Laumanu, and if there is one
thing in the world that Jack''Kennedy cares for
above himself it is this tall girl with the soft
eyes and lithe figure. And ho dreams of her pretty
often, and curses fluently to think that she is
beyond his reach and is never likely to fill the
place of Talarnitlu and tier many successors. For
Laumanu is tabu to a Nuitao chief—that is, she
has been betrothed, but the Nuitao man is GO
miles away at his own island, and no one knows
when he will claim his avaga. Then the girl gives
him back the empty.toddy-shell an 1 slyly pinching
tiis hand, sails away with her mate, whereupon the
susceptible Kennedy, furious with long disappoint-
ment, flings himself down on his bed of mats,
curses his luck and his unsuspecting rival at
Niutao, and finally decides not to spring a sur-
prise on “ dad and mum ” by going “hum ’’ for a
considerable number of years to come.
Mr. Jake Kennedy at this time was again a
widower—in the widest sense of the word. The
last native girl who had occupied the proud posi-
tion of Te avaga te papalayi (the white man’s wife)
was a native of the island of Maraki —a dark-
skinned, passionately jealous creature, who had
followed his fortunes for three years to his present
location, and then developed mal-du-pags to such
an extent that the local priest and devil-catcher,
one Pare-vaka, was sent for by her female attend-
ants. Pare-vaka was not long in making his
diagnosis. A little devil in the shape of an
octopus was in Tenenapa’s brain. And he
gave instructions how to get the fiend out, and
also further instructions to one of the girl attend-
ants to fix, point-upwards, in the sick woman’s
mat the foto, or barb of the sting-ray. So when
Kennedy, who, in his rough, careless way, had
some faint fondness for the woman who three
years_ ago he went mad over, heard a loud cry in
the night and was told that Tenenapa was dead, he
did not know that as the sick woman lay on her
side the watchers had quietly turned her with her
face to the roof, and with the needle pointed foto
pierced her to the heart. And old Pare-vaka
rejoiced, for he had a daughter who, in his opinion,
should be avaga to the wealthy and clever white
man, who could tori nui and sisi atu (pull cocoa-
nuts and catch bonito) like any native ; and this
Tenenapa—who was she but a dog-eating stranger
from Maraki only fit for shark’s meat ? So the
people came and brought Kennedy the “ gifts of
affliction ” to show their sympathy, and asked him
to take a wife from their own people. And he
asked for Laumanu.
• • •
There was a dead silence awhile, and then
a wild-looking creature with long white hair fall-
ing around his shoulders like a cloak, dreading to
shame the papalayi before so many, rose to his
feet and motioned them away. Then he spoke ;
“ Forget the words you have said, and take for
a wife the girl from the house of Pare-vaka. Lau-
manu is tabu and death walks behind her.” But
Kennedy sulked and wanted Laumanu or none.
And this is why he feels so bad to-day, and the
rum-keg gives him no consolation. For the sweet-
voiced Laumanu always runs away from him when
he steps out from his dark little trade-room into
the light, with unsteady steps and a peculiar
gleam in his black eyes that means mischief—rude
love to a woman and challenge to fight to a man.
Lying there on his mat, plotting how to get
possession of the girl, there comes to him a faint
cry, gradually swelling in volume until every
voice in the village, from the full, sonorous tones
of the men to the shrill treble of the children,
blend together : “ Te vaka motul Te vaka motul’
(a ship! a ship!). Springing up, he strides out, an 1
there, slowly lumbering round the S. W. end of the
little island, under cruising canvas only, he se.s
her. One quick glance shows her to be a whaler.
In ten minutes Kennedy is in a canoe, flying over
the reef, and in as many more alongside and on
deck. The captain is an old acquaint,m e, and
while the boats are sent ashore to buy pigs and
poultry Kennedy and he have a long talk in the
cabin. Then the skipper says, as he rises, “ Well,
it’s risky, but it’s a smart way of earning five hun-
dred dollars, and I’ll land you and the creature
somewhere in the Carolines. ”
The whaler was to lie off and on all night, or
until such time as Kennedy and the girl came
aboard in a canoe. To avert suspicion, the cap-
tain was to remain ashore with his boat’s crew to
witness a dance, and, if all went well, the white
man was to be aboard before him with Laumanu
and stow her away, in case any canoes came off
with the boat.
* * »
The dance was in full swing when Ken-
nedy, stripped to the waist, with a heavy bag of
money in his left hand and a kni.e in his right,
took a long farewell of his house and stepped out
into the silent groves of coco-palms. A short walk
brought him to a salt lagoon. On the brink ho
stood and waited, until a trembling, voiceless
figure joined him from out the depths of the thick
mangroves. Hand-in-hand they fled along the
narrow, sandy path till they reached the beach,
just where a few untenanted thatched huts stood
on the shingle. Between these, covered over with
cocoanut branches, lay a canoe. Deftly the two
raised the light craft and carried it down to the
water that broke in tender, rippling murmurs on
the white sand. Am. with Laumanu seated
for’ard, gazing out beyond into the blackness
before them, he ur B ed the canoe seawards with
quick, nervous strokes. Far away to the west-
ward ho could see the dull glimmer of the whale-
ship's lights.
# # •
The mate of the Essex was leaning over
the rail, drowsily watching the phosphorescence in
the water as the ship rolled gently to the ocean
swell, when a cry came from for’rard : “A heavy
squall coming down, sir, from the land !” And it
did come, with a swift, fierce rush, and so strong
that it nearly threw the old whaler over on her
beam-ends. In the midst of the excitement some-
one in the waist of the ship called out something
about a canoe being alongside. The mate’s com-
ment was brief, but vigorous, and the matter was
speedily forgotten. Then the rain fell in torrents
and as the ship was snug the watch got under
shelter and the mate went below to get a drink of
rum, and curse his captain for loafing ashore,
watching naked women dancing.
• • •
Three miles further out a canoe was drift-
ing and tossing about with outrigger carried
away. Now' and then, as a big sea lifted her
the stern would rise high out of the water and
the sharp-nosed whaleback for’rard go down as if
weighted heavily. And it was—with a bag of
dollars lashed underneath. When in the early
morning the whale-ship sighted the drifting speck,
floating on the bosom of a now placid sea. the
thoughtful Down-East skipper—observant of the
canoe’s bows being under water —lowered a boat
and pulled over to it. He took the bag of dollars
and muttering something about “ rather thinking
he was kinder acquainted with the poor man’s
people,” went back to the ship and stood away on
his course in pursuit of his greasy vocation.
* # •
And Kennedy and the girl 1 Go some
night and watch the dark-skinned people catching
flying-fish by the light of au lama torches. Look
over the side of the canoe and see those swarms of
grim, grey devils of the tropic seas that ever and
anon dart to the surface as the paddlers’ hands
come perilously near the water, and wonder no
longer as to the fate of Kennedy the Boatsteerei
and his Laumanu.

THE FINGER OF DEATH
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
John Oscott Marshall, M.A., M.D., F.R.O.S.>
was Jack’s full name, style, and title. In personal
appearance he was tall and handsome. His com-
plexion and eyes were dark, his hair intensely
black, except where a few white streaks silvered
the sable. Extremely witty, his conversational
arrows were never poison-tipped. He pained no
man purposely or needlessly, either with word or
knife. A remarkable fund of anecdote, both
merry and wise, gave to his conversation a special
charm. He was equally sought after in drawing-
room and club, and was as indefatigable in the
performance of his social duties as he was precise
and thorough in his professional work.
Our friendship had begun at the Scotch College,
was strengthened at Melbourne University, and,
after we entered on our professional life, the cords
of our fellowship had drawn us closer every day.
Both resident in Melbourne, we had only twice
been separated—once when Jack had unaccount-
ably disappeared from the ken of all his friends
for six months, the second time during my twelve
months’ holiday in Europe.
One evening I made my way up Collins-street
in the teeth of a piercing wind. I found Jack in
his study, encamped in a huge, deep-cushioned
easy chair. His feet were on the fender with
their soles turned to the bright coal fire that
glowed in the grate, and between his lips was the
mouthpiece of a yard-long pipe.
“Just try that whisky,” he remarked, as I
entered. “ It’s as good, I believe, as ever left
Ireland —clear as water, mild as milk, and strong
as blazes. Take a cigar.”
“ Well, Jack, going to tell me at last the secret
of that lost six months?” said I, banteringly.
His face changed. “I am,” replied he. “That
absence of mine was the cause of the Seitel
case,” was the serious, and, to me, astonishing
reply.
I vividly remembered the case he referred to.
An old merchant and his young and pretty wife
had been found dead in their drawing-room one
night. They lay side by side upon the carpet. No
marks of violence were found on either body, nor
did the inquest disclose any possible cause of
death. The old man had certainly suffered from
slight heart-disease, but the jwst-mortem did not
show that this had had anything to do with his
death. The young wife was perfectly sound and
healthy in every way. No trace of either
murder or suicide could be discovered either
by medical examination or police enquiry.
As the literary coroner remarked at the
conclusion of the inquest, it seemed as if Azrael
had laid the icy touch of his shadowy finger upon
them, and their lives had gone out like a wind-
stricken taper-flame. The case had aroused
intense public interest, but no solution of the
mystery had ever been found.
“ Your six months’ absence was the cause of the
Seitel mystery ? I don’t understand you. Why,
the two events were three years apart.”
“Nevertheless, I mean exactly what I said,”
replied Jack. “I am the only person on this
earth who knows, or ever did know, how the
Seitels died. But no one is aware that I know the
facts.”
“ If you know the facts, why did you never tell
them ? When did you find them out?” I asked,
nervously.
“ I did not find them out,” was the enigmatic
reply.
And, after a pause, turning towards me, he
quietly remarked : “ I teas there/'’
“ Are you mad ?” I cried. “ Why, ytm didn’t
even know the people 1”
“Please, don’t interrupt me. No; I didn’t
know them, or rather, to put things correctly, no
one, save their two selves, ever knew I did. You
remember what you are pleased to call ‘my lost
six months,’ The secret of that half-year is the
solution of the Seitel mystery. Even you do not
know where those months were spent, but now
I’m going to tell you. You received, you will
remember, a letter posted from a little bush town-
ship in the South Island of Maoriland. I was
really never within a hundred miles of it. That
letter, written a month before, was posted for me
by a friend on a date agreed upon, at a place
agreed upon. All that letter said was that I
would be back in Melbourne on that day six
months. So I was. But, on the date of its post-
mark, I was in San Francisco. How I got there
doesn’t matter. In that city I met a very pretty
little actress. So gone was I on her that, when
she went on tour, I joined the company and
travelled with it for three months. But one night
we had a lovers’ quarrel. I disappeared next
morning, and on the appointed day I was back in
Melbourne.
“jphree years afterward you went on your
European holiday. About a week after you
left I had occasion, one evening, to visit St.
Kilda. I went by train. At first I was the only
occupant of the car, but presently a lady entered,
and took the seat opposite me. From under
vny newspaper, I remarked that she had a very
shapely foot. 1 looked up to see the face of its
owner. She knew me, and addressed me by the
false name I had borne in America. I recognised
her at the same moment. It was my little friend
from over the water.
“ We resumed our acquaintance. She informed
me that she was married to an elderly American,
a merchant, and was now Mrs. Seitel. They had
arrived in Melbourne only six weeks before, and
had gone to live just off the St. Kilda road. He
was very kind and liberal to her. ‘But, then,
Frank,’said she, ‘he is old. Ah, he is not like
you.’ Frank, by the way, was part of my Ameri-
can pseudonym. But the rest of the conversation
doesn’t matter. Enough to say that I met her
secretly many times afterwards. I took occasion
also to meet her husband one day upon business.
“ One evening I met him again on the St.
Kilda-road. We walked on talking, and he
invited me into his house. ‘We’ll have a drink
and I will introduce you’—he was sixty-five and
inclined to dodder —‘ to my dear little wife.’ He
did not know how well she and I were already
acquainted. ‘Marie, dear, let me introduce to
you Dr. Marshall.’
“She never winced or changed countenance
and I was equally careful. That night was the
fatal 13th of March.
“ What ?” I cried, “ the night of their deaths ? ”
“Precisely,” answered Jack. “Now, listen.
That night there were no servants in the house —
they were away at the wedding of the housemaid’s
sister. The decanters were produced. Mrs.
Seitel concocted for the old man a peculiar
German-American drink, in which sugar took a
part. I drank whisky, she wine. Marie (Mrs.
Seitel, that is to say) and I went on talking, but
in a couple of minutes old Seitel began to nod. I
didn’t mind ; neither did Marie. Three minutes
later I heard a groan. Turning quickly, I saw
the old man clutch at the table convulsively, and
lurch, or rather pitch forward, upon it in a sudden,
horribly suggestive way.
“ I sprang up.
“ ‘Let him be ! ’ said Marie quietly.
“ ‘But he is ill ! ’ I cried.
“‘No ! ’ she replied. ‘He is dead / ’
“‘What?’
“‘lt looks very like heart-disease, doesn’t it,
Frank?’ said Marie. ‘You, of course, knew he
suffered from it. So, as a medical man, you will
naturally give the necessary certificate, and there’s
an end of it.’
“ ‘ What do you mean ? ’
“ ‘Frank, you are dense. He is dead. His will
“ Watch!" he gasped, “ I am going on—the long—journey !”
makes his whole property mine. I hated him. I
love you. That is why%s died v ’
“The temptation was great; it was horribly
fascinating. Fortune; a beautiful wife whom I
loved with the love thatpasseth all understanding;
the means, the assurance of success that these
bring with them—what more could an ambitious
man desire ? The chance of obtaining the aim of
my life was before me. It was a diabolical temp-
tation.
“ Yet a great calm was upon me.
“Quietly I asked her: ‘But how did you do
it ? Dead men tell tales sometimes, even without
an inquest.’
“ ‘Have no fear, dearest,’ said the insinuating
voice of Marie. ‘ln that drink there was, mixed
with the sugar, a crystalline ptomaine.’
“ ‘ But where, Marie, did you get it? Ptomaines
are not to be bought.’
“‘From you, dearest. Yesterday you were
telling me of your researches, and you told me of
the deadly effect of these ptomaines. As you
kissed me good-bye last night, I took from your
vest pocket, without your perceiving it, the little
phial you had shown me.’
“‘So that’s how I lost it,’l replied. ‘Have
you got the phial now ?’
“ ‘I will bring it you in half a minute.’
“ She left the room. Though outwardly calm,
my breast was torn with contending emotions.
Horror and ambition, justice and love struggled
in my heart for the mastery. This woman had
killed a man—her husband—for my sake. How
she must love me ? But, no ! pure love leads not
to deeds of blood. Only animal passion could
incite to the taking of human life. And her cool-
ness ? Great God ! this woman was but a sensual,
cold - blooded murderess ! My tortured brain
cleared. A voice from my soul seemed to speak
to me, to direct me. Before me was the
wine to which Mario had but set her lips. The
glass was still three-fourths full. In my pocket
was a little phial of a tasteless but intensely viru-
lent liquid ptomaine. In answer to the command
of my divine and human soul, I hastily poured in
some of the tasteless ptomaine. Replacing the
phial in my pocket I watched the bubbles rise in
the wine. Then Marie entered.
‘“Here is my little_ bottle,’ she said, as she
kissed my forehead.
“Seating herself upon my knee, and passing
one of her arms round my neck, she raised her
poison-laden glass to those beautiful lips.
“ ‘ Let us drink to our future !’ she cried.
“I glanced at the corpse of her husband, and
its glassy eyes met mine, with a look as of diaboli-
cal triumph.
“ * To our future !’ I cried madly, as I drained
my glass and cast it upon the floor.
“* To our future!’ exclaimed the beautiful
Marie, and snapped the stem of her emptied glass.
‘Neither I nor any other,’said she, ‘shall drink
from that glass, for from it I have drained the
toast of my life !’
“ ‘ Yes,’ I said, as in a dream, ‘ the toast of your
life /’
“ ‘ Ah, Frank, at last lam .’
“She never finished that sentence."
» • *
“Great God,” I cried. “Marshall, you
are a murderer or a madman !”
“Neither,” he replied calmly; “I was simply
the instrument of Divine justice. But do not in-
terrupt me. As I looked at Marie’s dead form
upon the floor, I was filled with a wondrous joy-
fulness. Lifting the body of the grey-haired old
Seitel, I laid it out upon the floor, and straightened
the limbs. Then I put the body of Marie beside
it. Taking from the table the glass from which
I had drunk, and placing it in my breast pocket,
I silently left the house, and wandered out into
the night.”
* * «
“ Marshall,” I cried, “ you are a mur-
derer ! ”
“ lam no murderer,” he replied. “Once again,
I say, I was simply the instrument of God’s
justice. Had I denounced Marie to the police as
a murderess, what would have happened? There
were two possibilities. Firstly, if she confessed,
and swore she got the poison from me and told of
our intimacy, I would have been arraigned as an
accomplice in the murder, and an idiotic jury
would most likely have hanged us both.
Secondly, had she said nothing about me,
and simply pleaded ‘not guilty,’ what would
have happened? The only evidence against her
would have been my uncorroborated statement,
for ptomaines tell no tales at a post-mortem. A
ptomaine, you will remember, is an animal alkaloid
obtained by complicated chemical processes from
the putrefying fluids of a dead body. They begin
to form in every body immediately after life
leaves it. They have been known to form within
less than twenty-four hours after death. Suppose
these alkaloids had been obtained from the fluids
of old Seitel’s corpse by expert chemists. No man
on earth, in the present state of medical and
• chemical science, could assert with certainty
whether the alkaloids were criminally adminis-
tered or formed naturally. Medico-legal science
is absolutely powerless in the presence of a
ptomaine. You know the ineffectual result of the
post-mortems pn the two bodies. Therefore, I
assert, and rightly, that in putting an end to that
woman’s life I did, by Divine command, so to
speak, the justice thaj; no other human means
could do, and, therefore, I was no murderer. I
alone knew absolutely that she was a murderess.
I alone saw the deed. Yet, such are the methods
of human courts, that I was absolutely unable to
prove the truth that I knew. In face of the fact
that human courts must have acquitted her, and
that they might have doomed me, and that society
would have doomed me, I did God’s work on her.
I teas Justice !”
“But, Jack, do you never regret your act?” I
cried, impotently.
“As an act of justice, no 1 But as the procurer
of the death of the only woman I ever loved or ever
could love, yes ! I have loved her ever since I met
her. I loved her alive. I love her dead !”
“ Yes, Grey, now you know the cause of my in-
somnia. I must go on a long journey to cure it.
You see it has even sent me for solace to liquor.”
Turning to a cabinet beside him, he took from it
one of those curious, high-shouldered bottles, filled
a glass with curagoa, and swallowed the contents
at one draught.
Then, turning suddenly to me, he exclaimed,
“ By the way, Grey, have you ever seen a ptomaine
do its work t ”
“No,” said I.
“Watch!” he gasped, “I am going on—the
long—journey ! ”
STEELE GREY.
Our Musical Neighbour
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Dense scrub, a network of leaves and twigs with
branches interlaced—here the prostrate trunk of
what was once a monarch, now partly sheltered by
scrub that from its infancy has watched and learned
the signalling of its mighty arms—whether the ele-
ments meant war or peace—while huge quilts of
moss and creepers are covering the scars won in
centuries of seasons.
There, a charmed circle, in which an old-man
fern stands guard with graceful leaves spread pro-
tectingly over their withered brethren still cling-
ing to the parent stem below, while from the
crown fresh fronds are daily strengthening for the
same duty when the strong grow weak.
Then the sound of water gurgling ’neath the
scrub, telling of the mighty leaps ’twill take when
the falls are reached, and the mad round danefe
with foam and bubbles in the pool below ere join-
ing the quiet river on its seaward course.
All is damp and dripping !- if by chance somu
straggling sun-rays pierce the leafy dome o’er-
head, each precious gem has representatives on
every leaf and twig, and Fairyland is rivalled.
Such is Stinkwood Creek in winter-time.
The gold was good—but patchy—patches of one
or two men’s ground with long blanks between.
The camps were scattered, the nearest to us a
quarter of a mile away, the only camp in the up-
creek direction—occupied by “ Ned the Hatter.”
Our tents were facing each other, one fly and
fire doing duty both for myself and Bob Eaton,
who held the adjoining claim. It was not uncom-
mon to hear revolver-shots after dark, not as in-
timation that pistols were kept in camp (as in old
Ballarat days), but tiger-cats were numerous and
daring.
It was just dark. Bob and I sat looking at each
other through a cloud of steam from drying
clothes hung about the fire, the day having been a
soaker. It was mizzling still,
although the night was calm.
We heard a pistol - shot in
Ned’s direction.
“ Another cat foregathered
to its fathers, if Ned held his
shooting - iron straight,” said
Bob. “He seems a morose
fellow one of the keep-to-
yourself sort.”
Some ten minutes passed in
smoking silence broken only
by the rain-drops from the
fly, when we were startled by
a loud and agonised cry.
Something had evidently hap
pened to Ned. The cries being
repeated, we hastily lit candles
and started off.
Travelling through scrub
in wet weather, especially
by candle-light, is like —well,
to cut description short, the
funnel-trick’s “ a fool to it.’
We had arrived within a hundred yards of Ned’s
camp, the cries seeming meanwhile to have grown
fainter, when Bob splashed in a shallow prospect-
hole and exploded with wrath, but his volley of
language was cut short by the most awful, blood-
curdling cry I ever heard.
A creepy sensation started at the small of my
back, travelled upwards to my hair-tips, and
seemed to bury itself inside my cap. I could see
waves of paleness pass over Bob’s face, till he
appeared like marble. I felt pale—which was
worst!.
We now moved forward without speaking, both
feeling that Ned’s career was closed. Soon we
came within sight of his camp-fire, which was
burning brightly. Ned was stretched on a slab in
front of it, perfectly still —so still. Advancing
with difficulty through the chopped-down scrub,
we were within a few feet of the body when it
suddenly sat on end, and Ned’s hand grabbed at
a revolver on the slab. “Mad ! Mad !” I said,
turning to make for the nearest cover and shortest
cut home, when Bob (who always seemed to have
his wits about) said, soothingly: “Why, Ned,
old man, what’s the matter?”
Ned, seeming to recognise us, put the revolver
aside—(with that movement my heart went back
into its right place, or nearly so)—and said, while
the colour returned to his face, “ Oh, you heard
me shoot! I was a fool to do it, but one of those
blessed cats was in my frying-pan. I missed the
cat, but not the pan, which ”
“Damn the cats!” sharply interrupted Bob,
who could now see that nothing was amiss.
“ Why the deuce were you shouting out to us?
“ I wasn’t shouting out for you,” replied Ned,
guessing something was wrong, “only, feeling
lonesome like I was trying my hand at ‘Nancy
Lee.’ ”
The silence was simply awful. The rain even
had ceased. And then Bob said calmly and
solemnly : “Look here, Ned, you are a much older
man than I, but take my advice— never you
attempt to sing until the Day of Judgment, and
then just you apply to the Deity for the billet 0*
sounding the last Trump. You’re sure to get it.
With this he waved his candle and was 1
could hear him taking everything “in a face on
the way back.
HORIZONTAL SCRUB.


THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF MONNACHAN
(FOR THE BULLETIN)
The copper-mining town-
ship of Bullago was re- 3
markable for two things
especially—the presence of
asplendidassortmentof partly-
reclaimed horse-thieves, cattle-
duffers, and ex-bushrangers
of third-rate ability, and the absence of even a
single house of accommodation licensed to retail
fermented and spirituous liquors. And such per-
fect faith in the teetotal proclivities of the 400
men engaged in work about the mines had the
Licensing Bench charged with the local adminis-
tration of the liquor-law, that all efforts to obtain
a “square pub.” were promptly nipped in the
bud—this notwithstanding that the very last
application had been supported by a petition bear-
ing 380 signatures. It can hardly be matter
of surprise, therefore, that attempts should be
made to meet the demand by other than legal
means, and that the wisdom of the bench should
receive striking confirmation by the immediate
establishment sub-rosa of six purveyors of fluids
more generous than water. Even a seventh had
the temerity to attempt defiance of the law, but
as this individual ran directly counter to the
unwritten rules of “shanty’’-keeping by selling
unadulterated liquor, he was immediately scouted
as a disgrace to the fraternity.
And very inoffensive-looking places these
“ shanties ” were. Two-roomed slab humpies,
with bark roofs, for the most part, and
with a general air of poor, but Methodistio
respectability pervading the whole atmos-
phere. v The proprietors themselves were
bumble-looking souls with an expression of dove-
like simplicity hovering about their features,
sufficient in the ease of a stranger to dispel the
faintest suspicion of evil that might have been
harboured against any one of them. If any artist
of the present time is yearning for a model sug-
gestive at one and the same time of the virtues of
simplicity and calm resignation to the wiles of a
wicked world, I strongly advise the hunting up of
a bush “shanty” keeper.
For some six months matters went smoothly
with these worthy townspeople, and though every
week a member of the police-force stationed at
Gallago—3o miles distant—made his appearance,
and paraded the township with becoming majesty,
no arrest was made during that period. Yet it
was currently reported that, the authorities were
in possession of important information respecting
the illegal operations.
It was regarded as peculiar by those who knew
of it that Mrs. Monnaghan, the proprietress of
the inost popular “shanty” in Bullago, should,
whenever the police visited the township, betaken
so ill as to be obliged to retire to her bed. Mrs.
Monnaghan was Irish by birth, a widow by force
of circumstances, and the coneoctor of the most
varied and fiery drinks, out of the one staple,
rum, that ever tickled a bush-whacker’s thorax.
The only other occupant of her abode was a small,
drab - eomplexioned, slatternly wench, about 16
years of age, whom Mrs. Monnaghan described
as her adopted daughter. “ Sal,” in spite of her
profound ignorance generally, was an invaluable
acquisition to her foster-mother, and had chal-
lenged the admiration of the frequenters of the
establishment by more than one exhibition of her
natural cunning. As an adept in the art of
“choking off” unknown and suspected callers
and fencing dangerous questions she had no
equal on the field.
There was a flutter of excitement in the town-
ship one fine morning when Sergeant Crumley,
head of the Gallago police, made his appearance,
accompanied by a subordinate. This worthy
officer was a terror to evil-doers, and it was
matter of history that whenever he had previously
looked in at Bullago the town had lost at least
one citizen. What was the object of the present
visit? Burly Welsh smelters and firemen dis-
cussed the pros and eons in guttural periods in the
intervals of “skimming” or “firing”; “Cousin
Jacks,” temporarily immured in underground
“stopes,” wagged their heads ominously and
looked profoundly good ; while amongst the tag-
rag-and-bobtail section conscience produced a per-
fect whirl of excitement, and suggested in many
an individual case the advisableness of imme-
diately attending to important business elsewhere.
The calmest individuals, to outward appearances,
were the “ shanty’’-keepers, who donned an ap-
pearance of philosophic disregard of all sublunary
matters. Mrs. Monnaghan, it is true, was seized
with a shivering-fit, and was forced, as usual, to
take to her bed.
It was about 10 o’clock when the police arrived,
and an hour later the news spread that two of the
fraternity had been served with warrants. These
were Mark Thompson, of the Forked-tree-road,
and Dan. Macleevy, of Copper Creek Bend. It
was further stated that the officers were then on
their way to Mrs. Monnaghan’s, and, in antici-
pation of a little excitement, all the men “off
shift ” wended their way to that spot.
A loud knock from Sergeant Crumley brought
Sal on tip-toe to the door. Tear-stained, dirty,
and unutterably woe-begono in her general ap-
pearance, the sight of her as she looked up appeal-
ingly, with a gentle “s-s-s-h” issuing from her
trembling lips, on which a grimy finger rested,
should have been sufficient to extract sympathy
from the most callous-hearted. But the inflexible
Sergeant was first a representative of the law, and
a humanitarian afterwards.
“ Mrs. Monnaghan in?” he demanded, shortly.
“ Yes, sir,” sobbed Sal, wiping her smeared
face with the hole of a ragged apron.
“ Tell her I want her, then,” said the Sergeant.
“ Yer can’t see ’er to-day, sir,” moaned Sal.
“ Can’t see her ! What do you mean ?” retorted
the worthy officer, bridling up.
“She’s ill a-bed, sir; very nigh dead,” replied
the girl.
“In that case, I must go to her,” said Sergeant
Crumley, coolly dismounting and handing the
reins to his companion. In vain did Sal protest,
in her own peculiar phraseology, against this
indelicate intrusion; in vain did she conjure up
for the officer’s information pitiful pictures of the
poor widow’s dangerous condition, and the results
that were likely to follow a sudden fright. Ser-
geant Crumley was as adamant to all appeals,
and, brushing the now excited girl aside, he
passed into the house, and through a second door-
way, screened with canvas, that led to an inner
and dimly-lighted room. There, on a roomy but
ramshackle old bed lay Mrs. Monnaghan, propped
up with pillows and groaning as if in pain.
“ Now, Mrs. Monnaghan,” said the Sergeant,
“ where have you got your liquor ?”
Mrs. Monnaghan lurched heavily, and her eyes
fixed themselves vacantly on the grimy bark ceil-
ing. She had not even looked at the intruder.
“Is it liquor ye said, Dinnis Phegan?” she
asked, faintly ; “an’ ye’re afther knowin’ Oi tuk
the plidge whin poor Patsy doyed. If it was to
save me loife, it’s divil a dhrop o’ the bastely
stuff Oi’d touch.”
“ Yes, that’s very nice, Mrs. Monnaghan, but
it won’t suit just now. I’m Sergeant Crumley,
and I want to know where you keep your grog ? ”
A great light seemed to break in upon the sick
woman, and, turning her head, she smiled sweetly
at her visitor. Even as she did this, however,
her face twitched convulsively.
“ An’ is it you, Sarjint ? ” she remarked. “ It’s
down wid the shpasums Oi’vebeen this four days,
wid divil a sowd to give me a bite or a sup, ex-
ceptin’ Sal there, an’ it’s little good she is, Oi’m
thinkin, an’ phwat wid the ”
“Perhaps you don’t understand me, Mrs.
Monnaghan,” interrupted the Sergeant. “You’ve
got liquor in the place, and I want to know
where you keep it.” Mrs. Monnaghan wriggled
uncomfortably in the bed.
IN AT THE DEATH.
NEW-CHUM [discussing rabbit question ): “It must be gwand fun
wunning them down with dawgs, but I should prefah
a good hack.”
Old Rabbiter ; “ A hack ! An’ what do ye want a ’ack
fer? ”
NEW-CHUM (evidently thinking of foxes or something of the sort) :
“Why, to be in at the death.”
“ If it’s liquor ye want, ye can look for it till
yer oyes bulge, an’ ye won’t foind the fill of a
thimble,” she retorted, with some energy.
Acting upon the suggestion, before proceeding
further, Sergeant Crumley called his assistant,
and together they searched every hole and corner
of the place, but without success. Sal stood
gloomily by during the proceedings, and a gleam
of satisfaction spread over her bleared face as they
relinquished their quest. It was short-lived, how-
ever.
“ Now, Mrs. Monnaghan, or Mrs. Walsh, as
you were called at Boolah and Cow Flat ” (the
sick woman gasped as she heard this), “ we’re
going to search the bed ; over with you!”
And the Sergeant, with a merry twinkle
in his eye, hoisted her unwieldy form from one
side to the other, and thrusting his hands beneath
the coverlet possessed himself of an object that
now loomed up with terrible distinctness from the
exact spot on which the good woman had lain
with, no doubt, a considerable degree of dis-
comfort.
“Ye dir-rty thavin shpalpeen, it’s raesilf that’ll
make ye pay fur it ! Git out ye blaygard, wid yer
oily phiz; an’ its mesilf as’ll shpake to yer woife
wid me own lips, an’ tell er phwat ye’d be afther
doin’.”
“There, there, don’t get excited!” said the
Sergeant in a soothing tone. “I’m sorry to hurt
the feelings of a lady, but this is the third time
you’ve played this trick. Never mind,” he added,
“ we’ll console you with an advertisement in the
local paper. ‘At her residence, Bullago, on 21st
December, Mrs. Monnaghan, of a two-gallon keg
of rum.’ How would that do? ”
But the only answer vouchsafed to this con-
siderate enquiry, as the troopers passed from the
scene of shattered commerce and confiscated rum,
was a torrent of withering abuse.
And the majesty of the law was, in due course,
triumphantly vindicated.

H.A.S.
THE EFFLORESCENCE OF DODSON
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
One of the landmarks of the Procrastination
Department, that important branch of the service
housed at the top of Collins-street, is Dodson.
“Old Dod,” or “Doddie,” as he was variably
called, had been in the department for an undeter-
mined length of time; he never seemed to get
transferred or promoted, had apparently no influ-
ence, and never complained or protested. Which
was perhaps cause and effect.
He was a small, podgy, unromantie being, with
weak, watery, spectacled eyes, a wonderful nose,
a lame leg, and head beginning to grow bald.
“Doddie” was always the first to arrive at the
office; at 4.30 p.m. he carefully wiped his pen,
arranged his papers, folded his blotting - pad
exactly in the middle of his desk, exchanged his
office-coat for a worn and shiny frock, dusted his
hat, and walked off as rapidly as his limp would
allow down the shady side of Collins-street—an
object of half-pitying contempt to the other gentle-
men of the service. Truth to tell, the poor soul
would have liked to join
one or other of those
cheerful groups that
passed him with a jesting
salutation more or less
kind; but he was shy,
and they, eager to
reach the Block, walked
quicker than he was
able : the good, simple
fellow thought it was but
natural that they should
feel little inclined for
the company of such a
musty old fogey and
then he would sigh. At
the Town Hall corner
he would buy an evening
paper from one particu-
lar little arab, who also
limped, wait for a St.
Kilda tram, and vanish
southward. Where ha
lived and how he lived
none knew, despite the
various facetious legends
current in the office on
the subject.
One afternoon the Pro-
crastination Department
received a shock such as
it had not felt since Black
Wednesday. The public
business was proceeding
with that calm and dig-
nified dilatoriness which
sat so well upon the
office, and a section of the
public was fuming im-
patiently, with much
looking at watches and
beating of hasty tattoos
on the counter at the
prospect of losing its
train or its mail: when
in tripped a fluffy
golden-haired damsel,
very petite, with eyes
so bright and laughing,
cheeks so dimpled, and
teeth so pearly white,
and looking so fresh and
dainty in her light sum-
mer dress, which was gathered up to reveal a
ravishing glimpse of white petticoat and the
prettiest of tan shoes, that every man in that office
straightway lost his heart, and metaphorically fell
down and worshipped. Four clerks sprang
simultaneously to the counter.
“ Can I see Mr. Dodson, please ?” enquired the
beauteous vision of him who, lucky man, happened
to be nearest.
“ I beg your pardon. Mr. Who ?’ ’ gasped the
astonished Jones.
“ Dodson” —imperiously—“Mr. James Dodson,
of the Procrastination Office. Is not this the
Procrastination Office ?’’
“ Oh—ah —yes—yes, certainly—one moment —
please to be seated.” And the abashed clerk
stepped to a door labelled “Correspondence
Branch.” “Mr. Dodson!”
At the call, Doddie came forth, and the depart-
ment as one man laid down its pen, and stared
hopelessly to see a little hand thrust through
Doddie’s arm, and Doddie himself marched into
the corridor, in smiling and whispered conference
with the sweetest little head in the world. In a
moment he returned, slightly flushed, to meet a
volley of bantering enquiries.
“ Gentlemen,” he said, with a curious, proud
gravity quite foreign to him, “ that is my sister,”
and during the speechless amazement occasioned
by this remark, “ Old Dod ” limped back to his
room.
It was instructive to observe the sudden respect
with which this former nonenity was now treated.
One who could possess so peerless a being as a
sister could not be such a muff after all. The
radiance that emanated from “ Miss Doddie ” had
a reflection in her brother. It became the estab-
lished custom for the little lady to meet him,
if the day were fine, at half-past four, on the
Treasury steps, and walk into town with him,
laughing and chatting in the most enchanting
manner, and always insisting on taking a turn upon
the Block. It was remarkable, too, how the gen-
tlemen of the department seemed to have lost
their former eagerness to depart as hastily as pos-
sible from the scene of their labours; how fre-
quently it happened that they emerged from the
door at the same moment as Doddie, or, overtak-
ing him, had to stop on some small pretext of
business, and how many of them consequently
were introduced to Miss Doddie. And so it
came to pass that “old Dod ” no longer wended
his way solitary down the hill, but in the very
midst of the cheerful geniality-for which his shy
soul had so often longed. Nor was this all. Doddie.
found himself, with astonishment, joining in little
theatre-parties and other pleasure excursions, and
actually on Sunday evenings there were the most
delightful tea-parties at Doddie’s house—which
was voted not at all a bad place—with its high
hedge, little garden, and broad verandah, on
which the gentlemen sat and smoked whi's.
Doddie’s sister played or sang softly to them
through the open window. Ah ! those were happy
days when Nellie Dodson was queen of hearts, and
the soul of Doddie, her brother and humble slave,
was conscious of the passionate impulse of its long
delayed springtide.
A shadow fell upon the Procrastination D< part-
ment when for three days Doddie’s sister was not
seen, and on the fourth it became known that she
was ill of a fever then epidemic. They were very
subdued and considerate, those good fellows ; they
loaded Doddie with flowers and kind messages,
they called and went away with sorrow in then
hearts and no words upon their lips. Even the
stern old head of the department sent to hear the
daily bulletin. At last one day Doddie’s tfhair
remained vacant and the clerks did no work, not
from their usual official somnolence, bfit from
feverish anxiety. By-and-bye came a note to say.
that Miss Doddie had died that morning, sending
her love, with almost her last breath, to her
“ brother’s friends who had been so kind to her.”
And for three days somehow no one in the office
seemed to talk very loudly.
Nevertheless the office gradually recovered and
was presently no less gay and cheerful than of
yore. But Doddie will never recover.
And now again does “old Dod” limp down
Collins-street in the afternoon sun, solitary, but
with no sigh,
Melbourne.
SIGNOR FABIAN
THE NIG HTINGALE
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
When the moon a golden-pale
Lustre on my casement flings,
An enchanted nightingale
In the haunted silence sings.
Strange the song; its wondrous words
Taken from the primal tongue,
Known to men, and beasts, and birds,
When the care-worn world was young,
List’ning low, I hear the stars
Through her strains move solemnly,
And, on lonesome banks and bars,
Hear the sobbing of the sea.
And my mem’ry dimly gropes,
Hints to gather, from her song,
Of forgotten fears and hopes,
Joys and griefs forgotten long.
And I feel once more the strife
Of a passion, fierce and grand,
That, in some long-vanished life,
Burnt out in an ancient land.
Ah, my Love, in robes of white
Standing by a moonlit sea,
Like a lily of the night,
Hast thou quite forgotten me ?
Dost thou never dream at whiles
Of that silent, templed vale,
And the dim wood in whose aisles
Sang a secret nightingale ?
Whither hast thou gone ? What star
Holds thy spirit pure and fine ?
In this world below there are
None like thee: and thou wert mine !
For a season all things last,
Love and Joy, and Life and Death ;
Thou art portion of my past,
I of thine, whilst Time draws breath.
Fades the moonlight golden-pale,
And the bird has ceased to sing—
Ah, it was no nightingale,
But my heart—remembering.
Melb.

"ANNA":A Bush Idyll
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The sun was already settling down over
the long line of hills, faintly blue in the evening
haze, before Anna and her companion turned their
horses’ heads towards home. In front of them
was nothing save the’ rolling waves of grass
stretching away in the distance to Warrigal Peak
on the right, to Coowarra on the left, and through
the gorges to the Western plains beyond—two
thousand square miles of open downs with a
circling barrier of volcanic peaks. The faintest
breeze hardly stirred the heads of the tall, tufted
Mitchell grass, the atmosphere was clear, as it
only can be in the upland interior, causing the
far-off horizon to appear still more distant. The
evening was falling without sound and almost
without life —here a bustard turkey flying home
from its evening meal, there a grass-rat darting
under the horses’ feet.
As the horses jogged slowly down the black-soil
track, neither of the riders spoke. To Anna the
unfamiliar stillness of the solitude seemed oppres-
sive. Her companion,
who had lived in it all
bis life, was thinking.
Once, as they went into
theshade of a deep ti-treo
gully and the horses
came close together, ho
took her suddenly round
the waist, drawing her
across to him and kiss-
ing her almost fiercely,
she hardly resisting ; but
there was still almost
light enough to see the
flash in her eyes. The
gate of the Warrigal
homestead is two miles
from the homestead itself)
and here the track
diverges to Coowarra.
As they arrived, Ken-
nedy dismounted, letting
the reins of his horse go
free.
“ Anna,” he said, “I
must have your answer
before we part.” Then,
as she made no reply,
but sat, as one under a
spell, gazing down at her
horse’s head, he went
on; “I must have an
answer now, do you hear? There has been
enough shilly-shallying. I have known you for a
month—surely that is long enough to make up
one’s mind. You must know that I love you;
and you love me—at least, you have made me
think so. What more do we want? Say you,
and let it be settled.”
“And Bessie?” said Anna.
“Bessie! What has Bessie to do with it?
Bessie and I are not engaged. It is true we
might have been, had you not come here. I sup-
pose I had only to lift my finger. 1 have told you
my position, frankly. You know I must to some
extent marry ?or money—that is, I cannot marry
without money. H I can only clear off the mort-
gage on Coowarra, I shall be free ; and, with my
knowledge, there is no saying how far I may go.
Your fifteen-thousand, or Bessie’s, it is all the
same; but I love you, and I do not love your
sister. Give me an answer.”
The man was talking fiercely and earnestly, but
the girl said nothing. She was not accustomed
to be wooed thus. Those who had come before
to Anna Karolin had mostly done so with a full
sense of their own failings and of her surpassing
merits ; but the feeling of being mastered is never
unpleasant to a woman of her type (or indeed of
any type), and when Kennedy, taking both her
wrists, drew her towards him repeating his
request, her answer, although faint, was distinct.
Then, as straightening herself in the saddle, she
rode through the gate, she added : “It will be
better to say nothing about it—just yet.”
• » #
As she cantered down the track towards
home, Anna regained her composure. So far as
it Vas in the power of a purely selfish and animal
creature to love anyone, she loved Kennedy. The
very masterfulness and frankness of the man had
impressed her, recognising a nature akin to her
own. Girls with somewhat reddish hair, grey
eyes and rather large mouths, are either freckled
and very plain, or they have white skins and are
attractive to most men. Anna belonged to the
latter category. Girls of this kind, too, have
mostly a very keen idea of what they want, and
usually contrive to get it. Anna also belonged to
this category. Moreover, she had J 615,000 and
was quite aware of it. So, on she felt,
now she was alone, that she might have done
better for herself and her ambitions; but then
she had never loved anyone before, and this love
of hers was a new plaything, which she could not
make up her mind to forego—at any rate, for a
while—Sbd. at she said to herself, swinging
off her horse at the Warrigal sliprails, “ After
all, one never knows what may happen.”
As Kennedy rode home, he, too, was satisfied.
“One or the other,” he thought, “one or the
other. I should have taken Bessie, but she is not
to be compared to Anna. I shall get rid of this
accursed interest and compound interest, and old
Gouller and the Union Buy-em-all Agency.”
“Old Gouller,” as Kennedy called him, al-
though he was really not sixty, and well-preserved
at that, was a personage. Amongst those squat-
ters who lived in the happy land of overdrafts and
first and second mortgages and liens over stock,
his name was seldom mentioned without some
uncomplimentary prefix. His fingers, they said,
were in the dishes of so many other people that
one never knew when his own particular mess of
pottage was safe from them. Nevertheless, or,
rather, therefore, Mr. Gouller was a personage.
Struggling back-country squatters, burnt up by
the drought, or eaten out by the rabbits, or washed
out by the floods, might, in their miserable soli-
tude, take all the satisfaction they could get out
of a choice variety of expletives; but, in the great
world, the world which practically rules Austra-
lia, he was a personage. The lying, guzzling,
pushing crowd that swamp our cities, the nine or
ten shaky “representative” men panting hither
and thither open-mouthed for a share in this spoil
or that, the legislators more or less open to a con-
sideration, the syndicate-mongers, deadheads,
toadies, and humbugs, could only worship a man
whose position was financially impregnable, who
was known to control more than one of the
big banks and more than two or three of the
great pastoral agencies.
To all these, Mr. Gouller was a personage, the
association of whose name with any expletive
whatsoever was rank blasphemy. It was felt that
he was almost too great a man to be a Legislative
Councillor, but he, being a millionaire and a man
of business, cared nothing at all what either town
or country thought; the country-mouse, let it
" She is going to have him right enough," said he to himself.
swear ever so hard, must go on borrowing at in
terest and cempound interest, and the town-mouse
was there to do its master’s bidding—at a price—
and, although he had agents in plenty, he looked
after affairs pretty closely himself, or he would not
have been a millionaire. It was seldom he took
an up country trip of inspection that there was
not a squatter the less, and it was from this well-
known fact that his arrival at Warrigal on the
evening of Anna’s ride with Kennedy caused Mr.
Karolin considerable perturbation.
His fears were not unjustifiable, for Mr. Gouller
had come seeking whom he might devour. Care-
fully turning the matter over, he had de-
cided that Mr. Karolin had had quite rope
enough, and that it was high time the station
should become the property of someone with more
practical ideas of management.
“By Jove!” said he to himself, “the fellow
has sunk enough of our money with his fads to
make ten men’s fortunes.” Therefore, he had
come forth to conquer; in other words, to fore-
close.
When Anna came back, she found, sitting on
the verandah, listening, with an air of almost un-
disguised contempt, to Mr. Karolin’s remarks on
station-management, a thin, clean-shaved, sharp-
looking man, apparently about fifty. As
Mr. Karolin briefly introduced them, Mr. Gouller
rose, offered the new-comer his chair, and mentally
placed his host and debtor 50 per cent, higher in
his estimation. Mr. Karolin had produced his
younger daughter.
Bessie brought them tea. It was always Bessie
who was bringing something—Bessie, a year
older than her sister, darker, plainer, with a
kinder face, not without its touch of pride. The
two had had the same fortune left them by an
uncle, but their lives had been spent apart; Bessie
passing hers chiefly at the station, the younger
living in one or other capital with this or that
relative, an arrangement which admirably suited
Mr. Karolin, who had no sympathy with his
younger daughter’s delight in the great world, and
only tolerated the ►lder for the sake of his domestic
management. Besides, their fortunes were of no
help to him in furthering the breeding experi-
ments which he made his hobby ; the money was
strictly vested in trustees till the girls’ marriages,
when it became their own absolutely. As the
testator had remarked, in making his will, “It
may be of some use to a young fool; but no old
fool shall waste it trying to breed an Angora goat
from a cross-bred merino, or a shorthorn bull from
an Alderney cow. ”
Mr. Gouller sat lazily watching Anna with half-
closed % eyes—a proceeding sufficiently pleasant,
until he became aware that she also was lazily
watching him with half-closed eyes, a proceeding
to which he was not accustomed. Mr. Gouller
was a millionaire, and he knew it. Moreover, he
was a bachelor millionaire, and the young ladies
whom he had hitherto deigned to notice had
usually shown their full sense of the attention
with a more or less becoming display of perturba-
tion. Now there came over him a feeling that he
was being, as it were, mentally measured and
weighed, and done up in small parcels. He felt
that he was undergoing a process of “labelling,”
and there came over him a curiosity to know the
result of the scrutiny to which he was being sub-
jected. This curiosity made him fidgetty, and,
moreover, made him feel that he was being placed
at a disadvantage, which is unpleasant to most
men, but particularly unpleasant to millionaires.
On the whole, he thought it best to continue his
conversation with Mr. Karolin. Anna, mean-
while, continued the weighing-out process.
It was not the personality of the man, it was
the idea of the potentiality of his wealth that
fascinated her. What was her own little fortune
to the enormous sums at this man’s command, or
at the command of anyone who might share them
him him? What power of spending on every
luxury the mind could desire, of queening it over
other women, of mixing with and ruling the great
world—not the mere Australian world, but the
great world beyond! What power of making
others happy or—and, perhaps, this idea predomi-
nated —miserable! It is the power always, the
power that great wealth gives over our fellow-
creatures, that constitutes a more potent attrac-
tion than the mere material luxuries it can pur-
chase for ourselves. And this old man could give
all that—Mr. Gouller would have shuddered had
he known he was being called an old man even in
reverie—could give diamonds as though they
were walnuts, presentations at court, London,
Paris—Anna’s thoughts were taking her far—and
then, yes, and then (with a sigh) poor Kennedy !
“ I beg your pardon, Mr. Gouller —no, I did not
speak, I was—thinking.”
On the whole, Mr. Gouller was not sorry that
dinner was announced.
Late that evening, when the girls had gone, he
had quite recovered his equanimity, and was pre-
pared to take it out of Mr. Karolin over his
whisky. It was a pleasant way of doing a little
business—to him. His host thought differently
upon the matter and would cheerfully have ad-
journed the conversation.
“ Look here, Karolin,” he commenced, “ it will
never do. We have let you go as far as we pos-
sibly can, and things are getting worse instead of
better. I was looking at the sheep in that six-
mile paddock as I came through, and a more
miserable lot of animals I never saw. We want a
little more practice and a little less theory, and we
must have it. lam afraid ”
As this meant that Mr. Gouller had come up
with the express purpose of taking over the station,
it was hardly so vague as it might have
- been.
“However,” added Mr. Gouller,
v “we will talk it over in the morn-
ing.”
But, somehow, that morning never came. It
was Anna Karolin who came instead. As the
days went by, business seemed to be a word
utterly dropped from Mr. Gouller’s vocabulary,
and Mr. Karolin, as he gradually settled down to
a full understanding of the situation, began to
feel that the wind might
yet be tempered.
Kennedy rode over
once or twice. To him,
Mr. Couller was affable
and superior—as became
his position.
“Coowarra,” he said,
“nice little place. Let
me see: you get your
things from the Union
Agency, don’t you?
Yes, I think I’ve heard
something about the
place. You’ll have to
be careful ” —and then
Kennedy had consigned
Mr. Gonller and all his
agencies whatsoever to
unutterable perdition.
One evening, he was
walking moodily in the
garden, in the shade of
the orange-trees. He had
had no opportunity for
any talk with Anna since
their ride, and he had
asked her to meet him
that night, without
getting any reply ; he
was waiting forthechance
when he heard her voice
near him. She was on
the other side of the
trees, but not alone: and
Kennedy, being a man
of nerve and no particular
scruples, and
prepared to listen.
The old man’s story
is much the same all the
world over when the
old man has money
“ Buried in the bush—
fitted to shine in any
society—all that devotion
and wealth could give,”
&c., &c. The replies
were mostly inaudible,
but Kennedy heard suf-
ficieni/.
“ S-e is going to have
him right enough,” said
he to himself, and he bent forward to listen mor*
intently. “ Well, I must try Bessie, and I’ll
make sure this time and presently another love-
song was being sung on the other side of the
garden. With the faint perfume of the blossom
on the evening air, came the gentle hum of voices.
“And you will really take me to London at
once—at once ?”
“And, after a while, Bessie, of course, we can
live in Melbourne.”
“There is nothing I would not do for you, my
dear Miss Anna.”
“ I don’t mind where it is, so long as we are
together, Tom.”
One heart, at least, of the four was perfectly
happy, and Mr. Karolin, diplomatically deaf and
blind, sat lazily smoking, with dreams of future
peace and happiness alone.
The two girls met late that night in the room
they shared. With Anna, the reaction had come
after her triumph ; she did not notice the look of
happiness in Bessie’s eyes, but coming over to her
said :
“Wish me joy, Bessie, I have accepted him.”
“ Accepted whom ?”
“ Why, Mr. Gouller —he proposed to me to-
night.”
“I hope you will be very happy,” said Bessie,
gently.
Anna threw herself into a chair.
“ Happy! of course I shall be happy. Why
should I not ? I shall be one of the richest women
in Australia. I shall have everything I want —
everything. Of course, I must be happy. But,”
and then, hysterically, “ why are not things
different ? Why is he not as rich as Mr. Gouller?
I did love him I I did, I never cared for anyone
else, and now ”
“ Love whom ? Is it anyone you met down
South ?”
“Down South? No. Who should it be but
Kennedy ? I loved him and he loves me. He
asked me to marry him last week, and I half
promised.”
The light was fading out of Bessie’s eyes; but
Anna, unnoticing, continued —“ I half-promised,
and then Mr. Gouller came; and how could I
refuse him? It would have been madness—l
should have always been sorry for it. Bessie, you
must marry him. Marry him for my sake. He
wants money to clear off his mortgage, or some-
thing. and he ought to have it. Do marry him,
Bessie. I believe you are fond of him. He said
once that he had only to ask to have you”—(the
light had now quite faded out of Bessie’s eyes)—
—“ at least, I didn’t mean that, exactly. But,
for my sake, Bessie, and for his sake, why should
you not both be happy ? ”
But Bessie put her aside.
“ Mr. Kennedy proposed to me this evening,
and —I accepted him,” she said. Then, after a
pause : “I shall go down by the morning coach,
so I had better pack up now. I shall be better
away for a time.”
Anna did not reply.
“ He consoles himself quickly,” she was think-
ing ; “ but, after all, it is for the best.”
When Kennedy rode over next day to lunch, he
found Anna alone.
“ Well, you congratulate me?” he said, with a
smile.
“ Certainly, if there is any reason to do so. By
the way, Bessie went down by the coach this
morning. She talked of not coming back for a
year or so, but she left this letter for you.”

Mr. and Mrs. Gouller are prominent now
amongst the horde of Anglicised “ colonials. ” The
latter, at any rate, has no intention of returning,
and, should her husband be called upon to under-
take the longest journey of all, she has much to
console her.
And Bessie? Well, Bessie probably married
Kennedy after all. A man has himself to blame
if he cannot excuse himself in some way or other.

The Reformation of augus
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I WAS cleaning my pipe with a strand from the
broom when there came a loud rap at the door,
and Angus Mackay, the Bohemian, the poet, the
drunkard and warm-hearted “friend of everybody
but himself,” crept in, and, placing his semi-
transparent hands upon the table, leaned forward
and hoarsely whispered, “ I have come, old man,
to ask one last favour of you. I want to die.
Will you lend me your sofa?”
Then, after fumbling for some
time in many pockets, he pro-
duced a dirty half-sheet of paper,
and, laying it solemnly before me,
added, “If the paper should
take any notice of my death, X
would like it to conclude with
these verses, which I entrust to
you.” With that he walked to
the sofa, arranged the pillow,
and lay down with his face to
the wall. I read the five verses,
and remember that the thing
was a protest against dying in
London, the city of his birth.
The second verse sticks to me
and ran :
But in the country ! There a mute
renew ii g
Goes hand in hand with never-con-
quering d< ath,
As now the year declines in golden
ruin,
And now young Spring steals in
with bated breath.
I read this verse twice to myself
—and then once aloud. When I
came to the last line he swung
angrily round, and groaned out;
“Not ‘steals,’ but * s-t-e-a-l-s.’
Let the word linger long and
lovingly on your palate—like
good wine.”
Angus was in a maudlin
mood, and wept oopiotnly, only
pausing in his sobs now and
then to quote some favourite line
of his own such as
The proteiting murmur of the tired
mill-stream,
with infinite emphasis on the
“ tired,”
'1 is man was my Hamlet,
and his whole life had betn ore
drawn-out prolongation of the
old, old question, “To be or
not to be.” The answer varied
according to the condition of his liver, and
was multiplied by the number of his “ recoveries.”
When the decision was “tp be,” then through the
press he would shake two worlds, the old and the
new, with Splendid dreams of things possible ;
when “ not to be ” he would creep like a wounded
cur into one’s rooms and borrow a sofa to die upon.
Business called me out for an hour, and I
returned to find my hero gone. I traced him to a
corner pub. and found him sitting upon an-up-
turned barrel, brilliant, bright and cheerful, and
the centre of an admiring crowd. On his imme-
diate right was a girl, a typical specimen of the
natural order known as outcast. Externally she
was dirty and draggletailed; a little insight
showed beneath her once-gaudy dress a plentiful
lack of garments, and deeper still a superfluity of
hunger. My Hamlet was entertaining her—the
whole crowd were drinking at his expense, and the
liquor they drank was gin-and-cloves.
There is a law of liquor that has hitherto
entirely escaped the omniscient eye of philosophy.
It is that the stuff drunk has the capacity of
awakening like instincts in people who, under other
influences, are fundamentally dissimilar. Take
Old Tom with your washerwoman and you will
discuss mangles ; beer with the bargeman and you
will babble of tides; while Old Port in the dining-
room' of the country squire begets a love of one’s
country—and a markedly conservative tendency.
But gin-and-cloves is cosmopolitan—it has no
recognised position among the alcohols. It is as
suggestive in its flavour as it is unique in its
influence; it, or perhaps the gin in it, awakens
celestial dreams to which the cloves lend warmth.
So that there is a soup9on of two hereafters join-
ing hands in a wine-glass.
Angus knew this. He, of all men, understood
the weird, wayward methods of this mystic com-
pound. He knew that, given just enough of it,
the men and women about him would divest them-
selves of the grave-clothes woven of cold and
want, and the souls of them, no longer restrained,
would dance a nautch for his amusement upon the
sanded floor.
The thought of the world to come without
Angus near me was so appalling that I had long
looked upon his salvation as a personal duty
inspired of selfishness, and that evening I set
myself seriously to work to think out the
problem. And, the more I thought, the more
obvious the fact became that the only possible
antidote to his unfettered waywardness was the
refining influence of some good woman who would
devote herself to his redemption. And I knew, I
thought, just such a one —a grand Australian
fiirl, with blood erfough to live and love, and a
waist as large as her heart. One generation only
separated her from old-world culture, and the
interim had added the one thing'needful—viz., -the
naturalness that is begotten of perfect health of
body and soul.
An afternoon-tea in my chambers brought them
together. A visit to the Picture Gallery, followed
two days after by a walk in the park, and the two
of them, moved by the omnipotent law that
governs impulses, foun 1 themselves a necessary
part of each other. To the ever-tottering ambition
of the man her womanhood lent foundation to
which a love of her cemented him. And she bore
the burden of his troubles bravely, because her
life was no longer purposeless.
The month that followed this introduction was
the one happy era of a tragic life-time. Each
afternoon .A ngus—nob the old Angus, bub all the
good of him —in a new suit, hat, and gloves,
would make for their trysting-place in the gardens
by the water-side, and there he would read to her
his morning’s work, and she would listen and
learn of him, punctuating his paragraphs with a
hand-squeeze or a look that told something of her
worship.
“ I want to die. Will you lend me your sofa !"
One day, the last of his sunshine, ho came late
and had nothing to read to her. Her quick eye
told her the man was changed—his shoulders were
bent and his face wore the echo of old dissipation.
They sab together a few moments and muttered
commonplaces about the weather; then, calling up
“ My Hamlet Was entertaining her.”
what courage she had, she aske’d what was the
matter. And he, gulping down his funk, told her
straight and bravely that his brother had been to
see him that morning, and, noticing the improve-
ment in him, had drawn out the whole story— the
story of his love and what it might lead to.
“ And your brother ?” the girl asked.
“ Had no name bad enough for me because, to
use his own words, ‘ I was bartering for the pure
and perfect love of a perfect woman, when I had
nothing to offer in exchange but the wreck and
remnants of a dissipated life.’ He called me ‘a
cad ’ and ’’—the man’s mouth was stopped as she
threw her arms about his neck and, drawing his
head down upon her shoulder, told him over and
over again not to mind, bub bo forget’it all. Bht
he disentangled himself and puffing her arms
fondly but firmly away from him, he said, “I
would nob mind, I would' it all bub for one
thing—every word he said was hideously frue. I
am not worthy of yoq, I dm a wretch of the lowest
order, and I must not see you again.”
“ Bub you have done nothing to be ashamed
0 n ” ' 4
X have done nothing to be other than ashamed
of,” he replied, and, in his black despair, he drew a
picture of his past life so exaggerated that the girl
trembled' unfil she freshened her memory of the.
man as she had known him, and then, over-
whelmed with conflicting emotions, she turned,
and stared at him with eyes full of a woftmn 3
wonderment.
no,” he continued, half to himself, half to
her, “I have poisoned my body with drugs and
Soaked my seul with vice. I am nob fib to live
God’help me, God help me !”
And the half-convinced, whispered, “God
help you !’**
They were silent awhile, and then, in a voice
quite changed and from which all .trouble had
gone, he asked if he might read-her a chapter from
his pocketrßible. She consented, and he read the
Bth chapter of Paul’s Epistle to the Remaps. Ho
did nob follow, or even understand, the doctrinal
questions raised by the Apostle in this brave chap-
ter, bpb the great, sonorous sentences and the
organic harmonies of it lent him strength, and he
closed the book a stronger man. And then the
two of them sab there and quietly discussed the
question of his moral ill-Health, taking quite an
impersonal view of the matter. And, in the end,
it was decided that he should resign his few small
change his name, go on to a station
for a year, work as a labouring man, and repair
the fabric of his lost nobility.
I heard npthing of Angus and his resolve
until a month after all was settled and he
had gone. The girl told me the story herself, as
she sipped champagne-cup at a Government
House ball, and shuddered a she spoke of
Angus droving. I should have learnt more of my
friend, had not an aidb-de-camp appeared on the
scene and claimed the next dance. The' pair
whirled past me", and I grew sickas I remembered
that those arms that were now encircling an
elegant vacuum had once entwined themselves
about the neck of Angus.
Later in the evening, I again had a few
moments’ conversation with her, and I still
remember the her laughter as-she drew a
graphic picture of Angus and his tqates camping
out and drinking “ posts and rails.” I asked her
if they corresponded, and she tpld me that,
although he wrote frequently, she rarely had time
to reply—“there have been so many gaieties this
season.”
That night I went home with another problem
to solve. It was no longer how to save Angus
from himself, but how best to modify the shock
that lay just a,head of him.
There are boats and boats on the sea of life.
There is your sixdtnot cargo-tramp, built, for the
conveyance of guano, with her nose plastered
inside with cement, paring for nothing, and
injured by nothing short of collision a con-
tinent; and there is your ocean greyhound that
almost shivers from stem to stern as she cuts
through a jellyfish. This friend of mine was
clipper-rigged and carried a skysail.'and, I felt
certain, had "every stitch, of canvas set. The
hidden rgck- lay just ahead, and must wreck him
uhless I could shift his helm.
I went to bed that night no nearer the"solution
of the problem I had set myself, and many nights
followed with a like result. The gods themselves
were fighting against my friend, and X was pbwen-
less in face of the inevitable. So weeks passed,
and the black cloud over, me grew blacker as the
time for his return drew near.
One day I gob back to town after a week’s
holiday to find, greatly to my astonishment, that
someone, a labouring man, called.at the
agent’s for my keys, and had been given them. I
hurried up by the lift (leaving my heart on the
ground-floor) and found the door closed, bub
unlocked. I rushed in ; and turning by
instinct to the sofa, saw there, in drover’s
dress, my friend Angus—lying
his face to the wall as if
asleep. One touch of his hand
told me that ,he had bepn dead
many hours. By his side lay a
,-S//// bottle that had contained morphia,
in his powerful grasp was j* paper
with the announcement of the mar-
riage of the girl I had found for him
as an antidote —and on the table a
note addressed to me, saying simply this : “ I
wanted to die, old man, so I borrowed your
sofa.”

A MERRY XMAS
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
ci A Merry Christmas!” cried the maid
To Cousin Jack :
A smde amidst her dimples played,
But he looked black,
As black as thunder all the while,
And on his sweetheart’s roguish smile
He turned his back.
“ You are not merry, sir,” she said—
He didn’t speak ;
“ You mean to quarrel, I’m afraid :
How very weak
To let us see you scowling thus,
Because—how dare, you make a fuss ?
He kissed my cheek.
“ I’ve seen you kissing (you may sneer)
Sweet Ivy King.
If ybu were but a ruin, dear,
How close she’d cling !
And hadn’t I as good a right
To flirt a lit— —•” He answered, “ Quite
Another thing.”
“ You mean I didn’t put my arm
Round Bertie’s waist,
And kiss him twenty times—keep calm !-
With eqgerdiaste.
Don’t pinch my wrist like that, it hurts—
To-night I’ll glue my lips to Bert’s,
How nice he’ll taste !”
“ Don’t be a fool,” said Cousin Jack,
Who seemexl upset;
(This time the damsel turned her back)
“ Come, come/ forget
“ A Mejp’y Christmas is it, now ?”
He kissed her lip a , her eyes, her brow —

The Spirit of Saturday Night.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
When the week’s work stops for the busy earth
My work’s begun j
For on Saturday night there is no dearth
Of “ pars, .’’undone.
And that quiet time to me is the best—
The quiet night ere the day of pest,
When I’m left alone to write and' write,
Till next week rises from Sunday night;
When my cares are soothed by that kindly
sprite—
The spirit"of Saturday night.
He touches you on«e with his soft warm fingers,
Does Saturday’s sprite,
And the care of the week that in your heart
lingers
He puts to flight ;
And he makes your pipe to draw, and,
(Ireaming,
You see in the fire your castle gleaming ;
And the good old wife, by the sprite trans-
ported,
Goes back to the beautiful girl you courted.
(For love in the weekly cares takes flight,
But is brought back again by the kindly sprite—
The spirit of Saturday night.)
Home on Saturday night is a haven—
No thought of the morn,
No dream of creditor, hawk, or .raven,
Comes with the dawn ;
And your Raris-hat, which your bank-account
mocks,
Is laid, over Sunday, away in a box ;
And you write all day in disordered bliss—
Write for your living such stuff as this—
And the dun who has chased you all the week,
And the creditor with the vulture beak,
Are yanished till Monday—are put to flight
By ttiat kindly sprite— 4 .
The spirit of Saturday night.
Till the last par.’s written—the last yarn’s
spun—
The last leader’s close—
And all debts I pay by paying that one
Which each living man owes.
Till then I shall Saturday eve,
That brings to me breathing-time time to
retrieve —
To make fresh vows for the week to bo,
To mourn the vows I last week set free,
To write the yarns criticised by you,
And to think about thinking of that I’ll do
Some when, some where, 'that will bring me
fame,
And make a thing of note my name
To other men than the vulpine dun
(Who dies each'week till the next’s begun).
And Heaven, I think, is a room of light,
Where it’s ever and ever a Saturday night,
And you’re caged in from worry and debtor’s
plight
By that kindly sprite—
Thh spirit of Saturday night.
Melb.

THE CHRISTENING OF MAGINNIS MAGEE.


"Sweeney" Asketch "Out-Back"
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
It was somewhere in September, and the sun was
going down,
When I came, in search of “copy,” to a Darling
River town ;
“ Come-and-have-a-drink ” we’ll call it —’tis a
fitting name, I think—
And ’twas raining, for a wonder, up at “Come-
and-have-a-drink.”
’Neath the public-house verandah I was resting on
a bunk,
When a stranger rose before me, and he said that
he was drunk;
He apologised for speaking; there was no offence,
he swore,
But he somehow seemed to fancy that he’d seen
my face before.
“ No erfence,” he said. I told him that he needn’t
mention it,
For I might have met him somewhere, I had
travelled round a bit,
And I knew a lot of fellows in the bush and in the
streets —
“ But a fellow can’t remember all the fellows that
he meets.”
Very old and thin and dirty were the garments
that he wore,
Just a shirt and pair of trousers, and a boot, and
nothing more;
He was wringing-wet and really in a sad and
sinful plight,
And his hat was in his left hand, and a bottle in
his right.
His brow was broad and roomy, but its lines were
somewhat harsh,
And a sensual mouth was hidden by a drooping,
fair moustache —
(His hairy chest was open to what poets call the
“ wined,”
And I would have bet a thousand that his pants
were gone behind).
He agreed: “Yer can’t remember all the men
yer chance to meet,”
And he said his name was Sweeney—people lived
in Sussex-street.
He was campin’ in a stable, but he swore that he
was “ right,”
“ Only for the blanky horses walkin’ over him all
night.”
He’d apparently been fighting, for his face was
black-and-blue,
And he looked as tho’ the horses had been tread-
ing on him, too,
But an honest,, genial twinkle in the eye that
wasn’t hurt
Seemed to hint of “something better,” spite of
drink and rags and dirt.
It appeared that he mistook me for a long-lost
mate of his— ;
One of whom I was the image, both in figure and
in phiz.
(He’d have had a letter from him if the chap was
living still,
For they’d carried swags together from the Gulf
to Broken Hill).
Sweeney yarned awhile and hinted that his folks
were doing well,
And he told me that his father kept the Southern
Cross Hotel;
And I wondered if his absence was regarded as a
loss
When he left the elder Sweeney—landlord of the
Southern Cross.
He was born in Parramatta, and he said, with
humour grim,
That he’d like to see the city ere the liquor finished
him;
But he couldn’t raise the money. He was damned
if he could think
What the Government was doing. Here he offered
me a drink.
I declined —'twas self-denial—and I lectured him
on “booze,”
Using all the hackneyed arguments that preachers
mostly use;
Things I’d heard in temp’rance-lectures (I was
young and rather green),
And ended by referring to the man he might have
been.
Then a wise expression struggled with the bruises
on his face,
hough his argument had scarcely any bearing on
the case :
“What’s the good o’ keeping sober? fellers rise
and fellers fall.
What I might have been and wasn’t doesn’t
trouble me at all.”
But he couldn’t stay to argue, for his beer was
nearly gone.
He was glad, he said, to meet me, and he’d see me
later on;
He guessed he’d have to go and get his bottle filled
again,
And he gave a lurch and vanished in the darkness
and the rain.
And of afternoons in cities when the rain is on
the land,
Visions come to me of Sweeney with his bottle in
his hand,
With the stormy night behind him, and the pub.
verandah-post,
And I wonder why he haunts me more than any
other ghost.
Still I see the shearers drinking at the township
in the scrub,
And the Army praying nightly at the door of
ev’ry pub,
And the girls who flirt and giggle with the bush-
men from the west —
But the memory ot Sweeney overshadows all the
rest.
Well, perhaps, it isn’t funny, there were links
between us two,
He had memories of cities, he had been a
jackeroo;
And, perhaps, his face forewarned me of a face
that I might see
From a bitter cup reflected in the wretched days
to be.
I suppose he’s tramping somewhere where the
bush men carry swags,
Cadging round the wretched stations with his
empty tucker-bags;
And I fancy that of evenings, when the track is
growing dim,
“ What he might have been and wasn’t ” comes
along and troubles him.

THE HOGMANAY
EVANCELIST
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The Christmas
rains had made Din-
don Creek “ a ban-
ker,” and so an
unusually large crowd
was stuck up on New
Year’s Eve at Gubs-
ner’s shanty, just across the then swollen stream
from Duranmungan cattle-station, on the east
coast of Queensland. There were a couple of
Christmasing stockmen, two telegraph-line-re-
pairers, half-a-dozen swagmen, three or four
miners, a strange, clerical-looking man, with green
goggles and a paper collar to distinguish him from
the shirted-only bush folk ; Gubsner, Mrs. Gubs-
ner, Gubsner’s “ostler,” a conundrum both in
years and nationality, and Mrs. Gubsner s
children. Likewise, a wandering madman, who
was supposed to be a snake-catcher for various
museums. The chief char-
acteristic of the last was
alcoholic seriousness.
The whole crowd was
more or less exuberantly
drunk. The day had been
spent in horseback-feats,
quoits with horseshoes,
wrestling matches, “ draw-
ing the badger,” “elbow-
putting,” “ringing the
hook ” in the shanty bar,
dice, and so on—all, of
course, for “drinks all
round.” A small mob of
blacks, camped down at
the creek, had earned rum
by various aboriginal exhi-
bitions, and, as they had
turned rowdy, had been
warned away from the
shanty by a display of
firearms. The whites
fraternised cordially.
9 * *
“Let’s see the Old
Year out and the New
Year in,” said Long Tom,
the Duranmungan stock-
man, as „,the mystic hour
approached.
A chorus of assent endorsed the proposal.
A bucket was filled with rum and placed in the
centre of the shanty floor. Each man was provided
with a pannikin.
“ My dear brethren and friends,” twanged out
the green-goggled oddity, “hear me.”
“Go ahead I” gurgled Luke, the sawyer.
“I’m a Temperance Missionary, dear friends,”
drawled the saint with unctuous solemnity. “The
great object of my life is to reclaim my soddened
brethren from the Curse of King Alcohol. Liquor
is a fatal snare to all the most promising intellects
of this country. It selects always the very best
and whitest men to make fools of. Look at your-
selves ! What might you all not have been but
for Derrink ? You might have been squatter-
kings, paying your present down-trodden mates
fair wages instead of yourselves being the slaves
of mean, skin-flinting capitalists, who would rob a
laughing-jackass of its captive snake, just to make
a belt out of the skin.”
Loud, drunken applause,
“ Look at that man there. I know him. A
genius. And here he is a-catching snakes and
platypuses, and bunyip-hunting, and tracking
mud-turtles, and bathing his pores in strike-rne-
dead liquor, when he might be a Ybu-niversity
Pro-fessor, teaching all the high-born ladies of the
land the wonderful secrets of Science. Jusb look
at him /”
Murmurs of assent. The snake-catcher opened
his dull, drowsy eyes, and dropped his jaw, the
movements nearly causing him to capsize from his
seat on an up-ended bucket, and to let go his
pannikin.
“ Now, my dear friends, I have a pre-position
to pre-pose. Let us all see the Noo Year in, in a
noble and moral manner. As it is the Noo Year,
I am not so bigoted as to object to your pledging
yourselves in fiery abominations on this occasion.
For myself, my principuls pervent me from
imbibing anything stronger than ginger-wine—an
unintoxicating cordial. But you, my friends, need
not be deprived of your toasts for to-night, on my
account, and I’ll join you. Maybe, tomorrer, I
may secure some of you to sign my pledge-cards
and start the Noo Year fair.”
The snake-man staggered to his feet.
“Boss,” he gasped, hoarsely, “you have pene-
trated my feelings. (Sob.) I want no Old Year’s
drink. (Sob.) I’ll reform. (Gasp.) I swear I
will. (Choke.) Here goes my liquor, anyway.”
And, with a new light of resolve in his grog-
shot eyes, he emptied his pannikin into the bucket
of grog.
“Never sor him take any out of the bucket,”
said Curley Fred ; “ damn, but he’s a sly un ! ”
“ Bedad, his pannikin was flush full,” remarked
Tim; “he’s a gone case.”
“ He’s an eddicated,
come-down swell; did
ye twig his pitch ? ”
added Powett.
‘ ‘ He’scert’nly a know-
ledgeable man,” as-
sented Long Tom.
Gubsner’s ostler here
left the bar for the
stables.

The crowd “caught
on” to the Temperance
Man’s idea.
“ A booze all round
first,” stipulated Long
Tom, “ and then you are called upon, boss, to
give us a dying speech for the Year.”
Dip, dip, went the pannikins ; gurgling down-
wards went streams of chain-lightning; and
“ hoorays ” for nothing and for everything echoed
away down to the blacks’ camp on the creek-bank.
“ Another booze, boys, it’s my shout,” yelled
Luke, the sawyer, “and then let—er—the reformer
go it.”
Doses repeated.

“ It is now five minutes to 1893,” said the
temperance evangelist. “ I will occupy your time
in prayer, and afterwards you can again indulge
in your darling sin for, if Gawd pleases, the last
time.”
He prayed.
A snore broke the stillness. It came from the
fog-horn of the snake-catcher.
Strangely enough, no one stirred to rebuke him.
The evangelist prayed on.
Long Tom fell sideways off his block of wood
“ Hullo, Parson! ”
and curled up nohow on the earthen floor.
The saint concluded a most fervid petition with
inspired eloquence. There was not a solitary
“ Amen.”
Mrs. Gubsner had fallen asleep behind the coun-
ter. Gubsner was doubled up in a corner on an
empty brandy-case.
“I think they are all fixed, pard,” said
the snake-catcher, suddenly lifting himself up.
“No time to lose, eh?”
“ Horses all ready?” asked the evangelist.
“Right as rain, on the Duranmungan side, where
I left ’em. I’ve got the bark canoe planted also.
Now to go through ’em ! Guess they won’t wake
for hours.”
“Not much,” laughed the evangelist. “It is
the efficacy of prayer. ”
* 9 *
“Hullo! The canoe’s gone,” gasped the
snake-catcher.
“ Good Lord ! We must swim for it. Strip and
rig your clothes on top of your head.”
The creek was safely negotiated, the horses
found all right, and many merry miles were
traversed by the mates ere they camped, with
blown steeds, near Jooloo Creek. They lit a fire
and started boiling their billy. The crackling of a
footstep caused them to look around.
“ Hullo, Parson ! ”
It was the ostler.
“ Good morning, friend. How are we so fortu-
nate as to meet you here again ? ”
“ You won’t betray a cove, will yer ? I’ve run
away from Gubsner and collared a horse of ’is.
I'm puffeckly sick of the place, an’ I’m making
for the port.”
“ I cannot blame you, my dear friend, for fleeing
from that den of iniquity. You have done evil
that good may come, and far be it from a poor
sinful mortal like me to censure a fellow-sinner.
In the noo sphere to which you go in this gerlad
Noo Year, you may lead a honourable life and
become a Moral Beacon.”
“ An’ I got two bottles o’ brandy—real old
stingo—with me,” said the Ostler; “ the boss’s
own bottles, d’yer hunderstand ? Not the pison
he gives ter the crowd. I’ll give you one, if yer
like?”
“ Brandy has no allu-arments for me, my friend,
but I have heard that it is useful as a medicine,
especially in country abounding in brackish water.
The creeks here are brackish. I will accept a
bottle, my friend, as a Noo Year’s gift.”
“I’ll go to my camp and get it.”
The ostler went and soon returned with a bottle
of brandy.
“ I must get,” be said. And away he went.
9 9*
The heat of the afternoon of New Year’s
Day was dying out as the crowd at Gubsner’s
became fully awake to the fact that they had been
“ badly barbered.” Had Gubsner awakened first,
it might have gone hard with his shanty. But it
was found that the till had been robbed and Mrs.
Gubsner’s pockets cut out, and that the Temper-
ance Man and the Snake-catcher were missing.
“ They were spieler mates,” was the verdict.
The slip-panels of the horse-paddock had been
left down and all the horses were astray.
Gubsner’s became lurid with objurgations.
In the midst of the hubbub a cooey was heard
from Duranmungan hill, and the ostler was seen
tumbling along the track to the creek, whither
proceeded most of the crowd. The ostler fished a
bark canoe out from somewhere and drifted across
lower down with the current.
There was a joyful explanatory meeting at
Gubsner’s bar that evening.
“There’s yer stuff—all, at least, as they had on
’em—pick each un’s out for hisself,” said the
ostler. “I ’ad spotted ’em, an’ hoverheard
their lay in the arternoon, an’ was a-foxin’ em.
I cot ’em at Jooloo, an’ kidded ’em as ’ow I ’ad
bolted, an’ stole a norse. I gave ’em a bottle of
’ocussed brandy, an’ waited around. Well, I ’ave
stole a norse now—two ’orses, in fact ; an’ hif
they wants ’em, they’ll ’ave to come back as fur
as Duranmungan to get ’em.” _
Strange to say, they never came: -

In the West.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Out in the land of the setting sun,
Out to the bounds of the farthest run
From the grim dominion of desert won,
We follow the sweep of a dull, brown plain,
Where seldom the vision of falling rain
Gladdens the ibis and lonely crane.
’Tis a land where the militant sunrays smite,
From the break of day to the fall of night,
Till the face of Nature is seared and white.
A land where the mirage holds a glass
Wherein the one who may chance to pass
Sees lying visions of streams and grass.
Where the camel sprawls with his cumbrous
load,
Hurrying under the Afghan’s goad,
Jostling the teamster out of the road.
Where the fecund rabbit extends her sway,
And the hair of the squatter turns to grey
As his means of sustenance melts away.
Where the lazy lizard with sinister eye
Loves on the blistered surface to lie
In wait for attack on the heedless fly.
Where the click of the grasshopper’s leap is
heard,
But never the jubilant carol of bird,
And seldom the sound of a spoken word.
’Tis a land where a taciturn people dwell,
Who live their lives but are slow to tell
Their hopes of heaven, their fears of hell.
Did we ask them “ straight ” we should get
reply :
“ Our heaven is near when the tanks are high,
And hell is close when the cattle die.”
This much is sure—if we sought the blest
Abode of souls in Elysian rest,
We should not go through the gates of the West.

By the Open Grave.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Ho was digging a grave by a torch’s glare
In the peaceful burial-ground.
The face of the digger, much lined by care,
Wore ever a strangely gladsome air
As he scattered rank earth around.
White crosses and pillars of marble gleamed
Through the mist of the wintry night,
And the digger who delved in the torchlight
seemed
A cheerily eerie sight.
Whim took me there (for I dwelt hard by—
Say a couple of stone throws thence)
To see “ digging at night ” ; in the bleak July
They work long hours where the dead men lie;
So I scaled the iron fence,
And, picking my path to the toiler old,
Stood watching his gruesome task.
’Twas “ agin the rules,” but the wind blew cold,
And I proffered a brandy-flask.
This burial ground is a cultured spot
Where superior blossoms bloom ;
Some poor folk sleep in the dampest plot,
But higher society knows them not
In its very exclusive gloom.
And when I respectfully turned my gaze
On the elegant tombstones near,
Methought, it is here that the ton decays
In coffins that cost them dear.
“ A ‘ sinker ’ ?” said I, rather proud to show
My knowledge of graveyard cant.
A ‘ sinker’s ’ a job that is hard and slow —
The hole that is dug for the first to go
When a family starts to “ plant.”
A sinker it was, and of ample size,
And surprisingly trim and neat;
“ Aren’t you deeper,” I asked, as I strained my
eyes,
“Than the requisite seven feet?”
He drove his spade in the stubborn clay,
And still, as before, he smiled ;
Ite mopped his brow, and he pegged away,
Though his limbs were stiff and his hair was gray,
With the glee of a healthy child.
He worked me into a nervous state ;
My flesh was inclined to creep;
Sure, an awesome place at an hour so late—
And why did he dig so deep?
“ You must like the job ’’—and perhaps I made
A sickly attempt to sneer.
A broader smile on his features played ;
Then sinking the blade of his trusty spade,
Ere scratching his hairy ear,
He raised his head, and coughed and spat,
And a long, deep breath he drew—
“ I must like the job, you may well say that,
For. to tell you the truth, I do.”
He reached for his ladder, begrimed and rough,
And slowly he climbed each rung !
And he sat him down on a pile of “ stuff ”
In the manner of one who has toiled enough,
Let his muscles be old or young.
“Do I like the job ! by the One above
As’ll punish all devils’ tricks 1
This sinker to me was a work of love—
And I reckon it’s eight-foot-six.”
" I s’pose you’ve heerd of ?” ’twas the name
Of a merchant shrewd and keen,
Who had pushed his way into vulgar fame,
But was called away ere his knighthood came;
An advertised man he’d been.
“ What 1 this for him ?’’ The old gray head
An affirmative answer made.
“Well, well,” I said, “of his death I read,
And the loss that it is for —trade.”
Then the digger he took two lengthy sips
Of my comforting eau de vie ;
“ Good ‘elth ! ” said he, as he smacked his lips;
And putting his hands on his sturdy hips,
He opened his heart to me;
And there, on the brink ot the yawning grave—
I can picture him now, I can.
Some particulars { not for the Press) he gave
Concerning the great dead man.
They say we should always speak kindly of them
as ’as gone to their rest;
It’s a rule which the world mostly follows accordin’
to ’ow they were dress’t.
But I speak of this—man—as a villain, no matter
what goodness he shamm’d,
And to-morrow I’ll bury his body with the hope
that ’is soul ’ll be dammed.
His face was quite smooth when I knew’m—nigh
thirty year back, perhaps more ;
He was clerk when I worked in the cellar, at Duffy
and Donovan’s store,
He treated us chaps high and mighty, so we give
’im the name of “ the Don ”
Though for all that we larfed at his bluster we
knew he was bound to get on.
Well, I worked, as I said, in the cellar while ’e
was a-drivin’ a pen—
He come under the ’eadin’ of “mister,” and my
only title was Ben ;
And I might not ’ave know’d more about ’im,
except that it ’appened one night
I was walkin’ home late with my Liz. and the kid,
as was then but a mite,
When we ’card someone shoutin’ for help, down a
street very “crooked ” and dark !
I give little Nell to her mother and ran, and dis’
covered the clerk
Being bashed, as he lay in the gutter, by a couple
of murderous dogs—
One was kickin’, at least, while the other was
startin’ to go through ’is “ togs.’
I was smart with my knuckles in them days—worse
luck, if I only 'ad knew !
And was able to knock like a postman, a sharp
scierntifio “one, two.”
They went without sayin’ “good evenin’,’ then I
took mister “ Don ” in my arms,
And brought him along to poor Liz., as was all of
a shake with alarms.
We put him to bed at our place, and we doctored
him up an’ all that,
And the next afternoon he was able to put ’is sore
’ead in his ’at;
Exit before he went off to his lodgin’s he snivelled
a bib to my wife
And said he would never forgib “worthy Ben.”
all the days of ’is life.
He gave little Nellie a kiss—yes, a kiss to our
baby he gave,
And ’oped she would live to be proud of a ’usband
as strong and as brave
As “papa ” —this I learned from my Liz., who
thought he was very polite,
And told me how nice he ’ad been when we chatted
together at night.
Them words what he said to the young ’un was
words that we never forgot.
The notion of Nell gettin’ married ! it tickled our
fancy a lot,
And orfen and orfen her mother would joke, as
she put ’er to bed,
About the brave lover a-comin’, and the things
the young gentleman said.
Well, I didn’t stop long at that store, for at times
little troubles arose
Concernin’ the packin’ of goods—and one day I
“chucks it,’’ and goes.
The “Don” said ’ow sorry he was—he ’ad still
got some marks on ’is “nob”—
And without no assistance from him, T was soon
on a much better job.
The years come and went, come and went, the old
makin’ way for the new,
Till our baby—the other one died—as tall as ’er
mother had grew;
Then the ’ouse where I worked didn’t pay, the
boss ’ad to give us the sack ;
And I caught the fever and lay for a good many
weeks on my back.
The funds got run down very low, and Nell, who
was nearly sixteen,
And fresh as a rose on a tree (for kep’ like a lady
she’d been),
Begged her mother to let ’er go out into service,
as nursemaid, poor wench !
She didn’t know more o’ the world and its sins
than I know about French.
We ’ad ’eard, now and then, you must know,
that—the man who’ll be buried down there—
Had become very rich, a great gun, and was
always a-fillin’ the chair
At meetings, an’ such; well, the wife looks at
Nellie, so modest and slim,
And forms a romantic ideerof placing our treasure
with ’im.
“You did ’im a turn long ago, and ’e’ll not ’ave
forgot,’’ argues Liz,
“ Although he’s in Parlyment now, and your ways
are so humble to ’is.”
She goes out that very same night, with Nell in
her natty black gown,
“It was just like a play,” whispers Liz. Ah!
my God ! when the curtain come down !
He’d a nurse for ’is one puny brat, it appeared,
and she suited quite well,
But when Lizzie told him ’er name, an’ showed
’im the baby—our Nell—
He made ’em sib down, and he said, though ’is
wife was in Hingerland then,
He was sure she would like ’im to find a place for
“ the daughter of Ben.”
He spoke of the Church, so they said, where a
name for religion he’d gained,
And felt it a comfort to know that Nell had been
properly trained;
She’d ’ave little to do for the brat, ’oept to put its
red ’air up in curl;
Poor Lizzie come ’ome overjoyed at the stroke of
good luck for our girl.
She went on ’er knees and shed tears that night
by ’er darling’s bedside,
And kissed ’er agen and agen, in ’er motherly
fondness an’ pride.
As Nell drove away in the cab, we may ’ave
looked solemn an’ glum,
But there wasn’t no fear in our minds of the shame
an’ the sorrow to come.
Yet it come soon enough, Heaven knows ! Nell
’adn’t been long at ’er “place ”
When ’er manner got different like, an’ the sun-
shine went out of ’er face;
W ell, the poor, frightened thing ran away, afore
we suspected the worst—
Her ’and put an end to the life which ’er pious
employer ’ad curst.
When and 'ow? O, she fled far away—the name
o’ the place I forget—
Like a bird breakin’ loose from the snare that the
villain ’ad craftily set.
Escaped from the blasphermous lips that texts
from the Bible could quote
When he tricked ’er to get ’er alone, and forced
the ’ot wine down ’er throat.
She wrote out the tale at the last, in a letter they
found by ’er side.
What did he say ? Why, he said she was had, and
’er letter ’ad lied.
As for me, I did nothin’—l dreamed—and before
I was properly woke,
Wife Liz ’ad gone after our Nell, and I was alone>
an’ stone broke,
’E prospered an’ stuck to the Church while I came
down slowly to this,
Most people was ready, they say, the ’em of ’is
garment to kiss.
But, “ Vengeance is Mine,” sez the Lord ; there’s
the fire a-burnin’ below,
An’ the deeper he lies in ’is grave, the shorter ’is
distance to go.
I’ve been diggin’ for eight or nine year, in all sorts
o’ weathers, my lad ;
I never felt pleasure before in any such job that
I ’ad,
But this night when I drove in the spade, my
eart in my bosom did leap,
“ Long life to damnation !” I say. Now you know
why I dug it so deep.
The digger he raised the flask on high,
And drank to his awful toast,
Then went his way with a blunt “good-bye.”
A cloud-form, low in the morning sky,
Appeared like a wrathful ghost.
There were horses four to that merchant’s hearse,
Aye, the funeral show was brave ;
And over his coffin was breathed the curse
Of the digger who delved his grave.

BOLDER the Jackaroo.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“ The four-thousand-acre paddock is on fire !” So
reported the Murragul mailman to Tom Welder,
head boundary-rider of Buckegong. This had been
the selection of Martin Crawley and family,
traders in land. At the expiry of time, the land
reverted to the squatter and to nature —truth to
tell, it had not far to revert. Martin went north
and west and planted the large sole of his foot on
other broad acres. He was wise ; the law-givers
are unwise.
It was ten miles to the fire and twenty to the
homestead. Six men were soon on the scene, and, led
by Tom, they battled the fire that evening. Under
their watch it slept that night. Rising up lazily
from its bed next morning, sleepily gazing on the
red risen sun, and yawning the while, its languid
veins absorbed the red sun’s heat. It moved then
from its lair, moved in all parts of its giant frame.
A north-west gale bringing furnace-blasts from
Sturt’s distant desert, like the electric life of some ■
great battery, fanned the Form and gave it life—
indeed, strength and destruction 1
It broke from its keepers of the night more
easily than a tempest from the interdicting wand
of some Egyptian wizard. The flames licked
the bare ground, fantastically gyrated in the high
grass and scaled the giants of the forest which,
with dead arms, stretched towards heaven for
vengeance on man, their destroyer! Huge genii!
they smoked, puffed, and blew through these vast
pipes of nature and, bursting thence, rocketed the
heavens ! And the six?
They charged and charged again under a fire
more hot than that faced by the other six on.
the Crimean plain. The veer of the gale a point
would give them hope and courage ; there on the
lee side would they beat the flames down; the
wind would resume its course with a curling gust,
and the fire its sway with a loud, triumphant
laugh, that of the fire-fiend indeed ! The work of
heroes demolished by a puff of wind ! Neverthe-
less, fleeing and turning, they battled on and
hoped not.
When the fire had gained five miles on them,
fu n Welder called to him, the jackaroo, who was
his particular charge and an inmate of his house.
There are jackeroos and jackaroos—Bolder was of
the latter. His father, a curate in England, had
almost famished to provide .£lOO, the premium of
his son’s apprenticeship to the trade of destroying
the males of the fold and creating the dummies
manifold. Many a weary mile had Bolder trudged
from the vast levels up to Kiandra with sheep for
that summer country—aye, trudged on the uppers
of his shoes and on bare feet, for he only got paid
at Tumut. This was the breaking-in process for
young English colts not designed for gilded har-
ness. I must admit that Bolder did wear collars
and cuffs for one day of the year, that of the
annual show at Cookaroo, but a man’s heart beat
in his bosom for all that.
“Bolder,” said Tom, “gallop home; get
Stotton’s cart; put a bed in it, and take Mrs.
Welder and the nurse to Stotton’s. Then come
back and get all you can out of the house and
away. If I find we can’t block the fire at Helm s
two-chain road, we’ll be there to heip you. Of
course, if we do stop it there, all your work will
be for "nothing; bub it’s, better to ..be sure than
sorry. Ride fast! ”
Now, the fire had originated at the head of a
three-mile swamp and passed round on the South
side. Excepting for erratic gusts the general
direction of the wind meant exemption for the
north side of this low, unburnable land. No one
dreamt of the contrary, bub Bolder had nob pro-
ceeded more than three miles when he discovered
they had lived in a fool’s paradise. The flames
had blazed and flown unchecked round the
northern side, and were now less than three miles
from Welder’s house. Dried thistles ablaze curled
and cavorted in the air ! Such fire travels at from
eight to twe|ve miles an hour. Bolder recog-
nised that there was no time to ride back to the
boss. He would go on, cross the flames and save
the young sick wife of the only fellow on the
whole station who had ever shown him even a
rough kindness. He could carry her to safety on
his shoulders. Into the flames he went; horse
and rider blinded and scorched. A few strides
more and he was safe, bub —a hole filled with
ashes and fire; a blind plunge ! horse and rider
down ! down in the fire apd flame!
• • •
“Heavens! Look!”
The five firemen looked on a strange and
awful spectacle. Bolder’s riderless horse madly
racing up to where the other horses were
tied, wildly neighing, bucking, kicking, throw-
ing himself down to roll, leaping wildly
up, plunging forward —poor brute, the saddle-
cloth and saddle were afire on his back ! Welder
flew to his shrieking horse—even more awful is the
shriek of a tortured horse than that of a strong
qian in his agony.
“Three with me! Charley, you look to that
horse, poor devil.”
Away ! whose horse was first ? All men and
women know. That first horse shied at a black,
charred, yet living mass prone on the black ground.
The rider never saw such asight: his flesh shuddered
and crept; no wonder his horse shied. Wife and all
things else were forgotten for one brief moment;
he pulled his horse on his haunches, and, leaping
from his back, bent over the sickening object.
“For God’s sake, water 1 ” came in a deep moan
of torture from the crackling lips of the once
jackaroo, then man, and now—a god !if man can
reach that state by bravery and suffering.
“My God! My God! Poor fellow! Poor fellow!”
were all the words Welder could say as he poured
the contents of his water-bag down the burning
throat. “ For mercy’s sake, boys, lift him ten-
derly and bring him home. Oh, for your lives, bo
gentle!” he said to his workers, who had just
ridden up. Away again. As he rode onward, the
events of the past of his life rushed in a moment
through his mind ; chiefly and forcibly the events
of the recent past. He saw now the heroic reso-
lution, the fatal fall, partial insensibility, the
slow, steady burning, the returning consciousness
to accentuate the bitterness of the horrid scene,
the agonising, inevitable death of his poor chum.
How would he tell the poor, fond mother in Eng-
land ! That blackened corpse ! His wife ! Could it
be possible that she, too, would be burnt like
Bolder? “Oh!” It was a groan of anguish
wrung from his soul; his nerves quivered till
they tingled with pain ; the nervous electricism of
the rider frightened the horse to still further
efforts; that, and the wild death-touched excite-
ment that pervaded all things that day, made the
horse almost as fast as even the thoughts of the
rider. Every leap, the conviction that his home
was burning, was, alas ! strengthening. “ Die
like poor Bolder !” The words had burnt them-
selves on his brain. That fate for his poor little
wife of a few months ! He maddened !
He would ride into the flames that cruelly curled
over his poor darling’s blackened body—“ like
Bolder ” —and burn and die with her. That reso-
lution soothed the wild spirit of his thoughts !
Perhaps the nurse had insured the safety of her
charge. Alas ! had he known the nurse was gone
on the errand whereon he had sent poor Bolder,
THE BIGGEST EMU.
HAWKESBURY NATIVE (first visit far-back): “Great Scott, Bill, here’s the biggest emu ever I seen in my born days!”
and had not returned . But he is there, there
at the gable end of his house, there ’midst flame
and smoke. All the roof of his house is on fire,
and the walls burning downwards. The door
bursts open, and there, there, there on that
blackened floor lies his wife! . . . She, too,
speaks. But the words, though breathing a
wounded spirit, are ti pped with love, and confidence,
and hope! “Tom!” He snatches her to his
breast, and out. Saved ? Yes, saved ! A dray
laden with five casks of water stood at the end of
the house on a knoll. Whether the fire had
burnt through the staves and let the water out,
or had burnt the prop-sticks and wheels, and so
caused the casks to roll out, can never be known,
but the water that flowed in on the floor of the
house saved the floor and its tenant.
“Poor Bolder” are the brief words a kind,
sad-faced Englishwoman weeps over in the ceme-
tery of Cookaroo.

MOONEY the Conspirator
(FOR THE BULLETIN. )
One of the most charming and amiable
thirsters for English gore I ever met was Mooney
—whom I have named the Conspirator, for
reasons which will appear presently.
He was a handsome Franco-Irishman, 30 years
old, or thereabouts, with brown eyes, in whose
rich depths lurked, or seemed to lurk, strange
secrets and mysterious meanings delightful
memories of amorous adventures, and dark recol-
lections of perilous political intrigues.
Born in Ireland, he had been educated in Paris,
yet spoke English as well as he spoke French—
and both with the finest and mellowest kind of
Irish brogue, which is to the ear—my ear—as
Athol brose is to the palate.
For the benefit of such poor benighted creatures
a great number, I fear—as have never tasted
Athol brose I may mention that It is a mixture of
honey and whisky, and was, and is, the true
ambrosia —the genuine drink of the gods,
w • •
Our first meeting took place in a hotel.
Also most of our subsequent meetings, which were
chiefly casual, after Mooney had found out that
my thirst for the heart’s blood of the Sassenach
was but a feeble drouth compared to his own.
He was playing dominoes, and drinking whisky.
I afterwards discovered that he was mostly always
playing dominoes and drinking whisky. The
games he played I had never seen before. They
made dominoes, which I had previously con-
sidered a mild excitement for intellectual
invalids, as difficult as whist, and a
great deal more dangerous for Mooney’s
opponents. But I am bound to say of him that
he was not the man to allow a stranger, even
though that stranger should be a Sassenach, to
lose drinks to him (I never saw Mooney play for
money) over a game which that stranger did not
understand. The Conspirator was, indeed, in a
curious way of his own, as chivalrous as a knight-
errant, and would explain the principles of his
own various methods of domino-playing three or
four times over before starting a game with any-
body.
We played —after he had explained. I lost —of
course. We played again, and I lost once more.
Then Mooney told me frankly that playing with
gamblers of my calibre made him feel homesick,
and so, setting the dominoes aside, we began to
talk about Irish literature.
* * *
Mooney commenced the discussion by
saying that some of the grandest things the
human intellect had ever conceived were to be
found in Irish literatuie. I agreed with him
heartily, and went off into a ihnpsody over
the old Milesian legends—” The Story of the
Children of Usna,” a far finer subject for an epic
than the “ Fall of Troythe “ Children of Lir
“Blanaid the Beautiful;” Diermid’s “Rape of
the Wife of Fioun,” nobler in its rude state than
the story of .“ Launcelot and Guinevere,” even as
glorified by Tennyson; and other ancient Celtic
tales of little interest to the general reader. They
were of no interest at all, it seemed, to Mooney. I
saw the film of sleep drooping over his eyes as I
talked. I tried to rouse him by leciting those
grimly fine lines from the speech of King Laeg-
haire to St. Patrick —to be found in the poems of
Aubrey de Vere: —
But we are as men that through dark floods wade ;
We stand in our black graves undismayed ;
Our faces are turned to the races abhorred,
And at each hand by us stand spear and sword,
Ready to strike at the last great day,
Ready to trample them back into clay !
“ Thray magnifique!” said Mooney, in a languid
tone, when I had finished: “but what does it
matther anyway in these modhern days what hap-
pened in the grand ould toimes ? ’
It was of no use to say any more. Mooney can-
didly admitted that he cared nothing for —
Old, unhappy, far-off things
And battles long ago.
But you should have seen his eyes flash and his
nostrils quiver when I referred to the verses of
Davis and the ’4B men. “ Who fears,” ho cried,
springing to his feet, tossing off his whisky, and
dashing his glass down on the table —
Who fears to speak of Ninety-Eight ?
Who trembles at the name ?
When cowards mock the patriot’s fate
Who hangs his head for shame 7
He’s all a knave, or half a slave,
Dare slight his country thus,
But thrue men
Here he gripped my hand, wrung it fiercely, and
went on—
Like you men.
Will fill your glass with us!
“Molly,” this to the barmaid, “bo kyind enough
to fill up these glasses agin.”
* • •
Mooney recited the spirited verses to the
end, in accents fiery and with blazing eyes. Blood
is undoubtedly thicker than water, and race, in
moments of emotion, stronger than reason. As I
listened to him, I, too, felt stirring within me a
strange craving for Saxon gore—not much, a few
gallons or so, hut some. He finished with a fit of
coughing of a sort I did not like to hear, and the
flush of excitement died out of his face as suddenly
as it had appeared, leaving a red spot In either
cheek. It was suddenly evident that poor Mooney,
if a very fierce, was also a very consumptive con-
spirator.
He showed me his books, most of which dealt*
in French and English, with Revolt, in different
forms, “agin” various descriptions of Govern-
ments. They included, I remember, a little
volume upon “ Organisation from the strictly
conspiratorial point of view—and another upon
the best methods, as known to Continental experts,
of making use of dynamite, gun-cotton, nitro-
glycerine, and other compounds, not good for the
health of the Saxon when properly “ exhibited,"
as the doctors say, by skilful Hibernian patriots.
# # »
Mooney had, before this, given me several
broad hints that he was a conspirator of an uncom-
monly sanguinary dye, so that I felt no hesitation
in asking him just then whether he was an
emissary of the Clan-na-Gael.
His face was a study in scornful expression, and
his voice a revelation in sarcastic emphasis as he
replied : “ The Clan-na-Gael! The d d
whisky-swilling swaggerers ! No, me boy. The
brotherhood of which I am one is a moighty dif-
ferent affair. We don't think we are avenging
the wrongs of our country by getting the horrors
through dhrinking damnation to the base and
brutal Saxon. No, sir, we do something very
different to that. ”
He never told me what they did, however. I
suppose it was one of the secrets of the Brother-
hood.
Taking down a volume of Turgenieff from his
shelf, he read out to me some of Ihe remarks put
into the mouth of Bazarof, the Nihilist. “ That’s
the kyind of man I am,” said Mooney—“only
worse. I believe in wiping out everything created
that is,” he added,
by way of afterthought,
“ everything Saxon.”
# # •
But, notwithstand-
ing the bitterness of his
enmity to the Sassenach,
there was nothing small
or mean about Mooney.
While he was always
ready and willing to send
the entire English race
to Hell at one blast—
to use his own vigorous
expression—he had no
spite against the indivi-
dual representative of the
race. On the contrary,
he counted, so he himself
told me, several English-
men among his dear- st
fri^rK
.10 met is that, with ali
his ferocity of patriotism,
Mooney was one of the
most good-natured and
loveable of creatures. He
told me that ho had come
out to Australia, some
three years before I met
him, with a considerable
sum of money, advanced
by the Brotherhood, for
the purpose of working
against England at this
end of her dominions.
But not seeing his way
e’ear to doing this effica-
ciously, he invested the coin in a hotel—so that it
would be safe. The innocent astuteness of tone
he threw into this statement was simply inimi-
table. Of course, as proprietor of the hotel, he
had given the free run of the bar to any patriot
who might chance to drop in. The consequence
was that, before long, he had a score or so of
patriots boarding with him, and clamouring for
whisky from the first streak of dawn till long after
midnight. None of them were low enough to offer
to pay him for their accommodation or the liquor
they consumed, and so it happened that, after he
had been in possession of the hotel for a year or
thereabouts, it passed out of his hands into the
hands of—oh, bitter jest!—a Saxon by the name
of—but no matter, a name, at any rate, as English
as Hodge. At the time when I made his acquain-
tance, Mooney was himself a boarder, albeit a
highly honoured one, where he had been sole pro-
prietor and the Amphitryon of patriots.
* * *
I lost sight of him for a long while after this, my
own affairs taking me to other scenes. Quite a
year had passed before I called again at the
Hotel, and asked to see Mr. Mooney.
“You can’t see him,” was the reply given me
by an old man—the father of the landlord, and the
only surly member of the family—who was in the
bar at the time.
“ But why? ” I asked.
“ Because he’s dead,” was the grim reply.
“Good God!” I exclaimed, “you can’t be
serious. When did he die, and what did he die
of?”
“ Drank himself to death, and was buried three
months ago,” answered the ancient ruffian, pour-
ing the drainings of a beer-glass left on the
counter into a pewter under the tap.
On the following Sunday I went out to the
cemetery and searched for Mooney’s grave. I
found it without much difficulty, knowing the
compartment in which he would bo buried. There
was a neat headstone o ver the grave, placed there
by some friend of the deceased—a woman, I
fancy—and a little bed of shamrocks, in the shape
of an Irish cross, planted, no doubt, by the same
loving hands, on the humble mound.
It was, however, the inscription on the tomb-
stone which had most interest for me. After
giving his name, places of birth and death, and
dates thereof, it concluded with the brief and
touching statement —
, “ Hk Died for Ireland.”

Various
Verses.
The Sun of Love.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Across the night of life forlorn,
A sunbeam, from the eastern skies,
Flashes a splendour in my eyes,
A joy upon this crown of thorn.
I see the flying drift of tears,
Spanned with the rainbow arch of Love,
The steadfast sunlight, high above
The turmoil of the turning spheres,
And feel that burning Heart—afar
Beyond the eastern hills of time —
The Heart of God, that throbs sublime,
Through golden veins, from star to star.
Love ! life-blood of immortal life,
Forever pulsing through our veins,
Forever beating back the pains
Of inward wrong, and outward strife :
Forever thrilling every part
Of Life’s illimitable whole,
Awaking to a common soul,
The dazzled thought of every heart :
A common soul, with power to trace
One life, in air and earth and sea,
One hope, of final liberty
In Love’s last happy resting-place.
By Love’s unquenchable desire
Sustained through every mortal hour,
Mankind shall rise from power to power,
Upon the leaping wings of fire,
Till perfect Life, and perfect Light
In Love commingling, each with each,
Find silence that is more than speech,
And wisdom that is more than sight.

In the Dust.
(From the French.)
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
In church young Arthur dares to slip
This wicked note into my hand !
Before I look I bite my lip,
For O, my God ! I understand.
How can he now so boldly write,
Nor dread an honest girl’s disgust ?
The ribbon at my breast is white—
He bids me fling it in the dust.
Shall I submit me to his will?
My heart says—Yes. “ Unlock the door
I’ll come when all the house is still
With noiseless steps across the floor.”
The Right exhorts me to defend
Myself against this shameless lust.
Have I been strong that, in the end,
I cast my ribbon to the dust ?
If I refuse, I seem severe
And cold in his appealing eyes ,
Yet, if I yield in weak despair.
My sin upon his conscience lies.
Could he but read my heart and know
The love confided to his trust,
Would he then wish me still to throw
My poor white ribbon in the dust ?
Ah ! birds that flutter ’midst the trees—
Light wanton songsters of the wold—
O, flowers sweet which kiss the breeze
And squander love in powder-gold,
Your creed is mine ! and though I rue
This night, the judgment shall be just
On one who bowed her head and threw
Her badge of virtue in the dust.

0 ! waterfall that fallest to the sea,
Falling for ever to white virginals
Of olden melody, thy voice I hear
In molten moments of the summer stars.
When the great sun is dead in majesty.
From the white fields of home like thee I came
Impetuous to the cliffs, and I have poured
Treasure of love on altars cold, as thou
Hast showered thy rainbow on the icy rocks,
That have not felt thy kiss, and I would die.
Athwart the hollows of the moon-fed air
Come eider tremors of thy dying plunge,
Surceasing as child-tired eyelids droop
Upon a wavy bosom rocked with love
Shot from the Heaven for ever like thy song.
The moon is kissing thy keen diadem,
Sick for her barrenness, and all her face
Creeps to thy white arc down the precipice,
A« I have nestled, yearning with wild eyes
Into the umber chancels of a soul.

LITTLE BIG HEART
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The unanimous and freely-expressed
opinion of the inmates of Surgical Ward Z
was that little Quigley was the ugliest man amongst
them—and that was saying a good deal more than
they themselves were aware of.
When he first joined our company of human
wrecks, the humourist of the ward —a comic
singer with a broken leg—formulated a theory to
the effect that the medical students had subscribed
to buy Quigley for purposes of surgical analysis as
an anatomical curiosity. The personal appearance
of the man was such that several patients from the
remoter parts of the country accepted this raw
jest as a sober statement of fact.
He made one think, to look at him, of those
little human monsters which, travellers say, are
grown in jars, with a view to exhibition, by the
ingenious Chinese. His face was pitted with
small-pox marks, and spotted with patches of
coarse, reddish-coloured hair. He had odd legs,
each crooked in a different style of crookedness.
and his hunch—for he was
a hunchback —was not a
proper hunch set fairly
between his shoulders,
but a deformed hunch
twisted violently
awry, as if it had
been struckby light-
h, ning. He was
wizened, too, as
a dried fig, and,
with his enor-
U mous flat ears,
T looked more like
w a goblin than a
man.
Yet, in spite
of these unpre-
possessing features,
there was something
about little Quigley
which made us all
like him. Perhaps it
was his eyes—brave,
merry, blue eyes,
twinkling with
quiet fun—or it
i may have been
the quaint sim-
plicity of his talk,
which was a never-
ending source of enjoy-
ment to the humourist aforesaid.
But, although warped and gnarled in body, little
Quigley was a kindly and gentle creature who,
instead of being rendered malignant by his
deformities, as such unfortunates usually are,
acted as though he owed the world an apology for
not being like other people.
This was the first impression he made upon us,
and, I am ashamed to say, we regarded him with a
kind of contemptuous pity
on account of it. Even that
wretched being, the Man
with Hydatids, and that dis-
mal old pariah,' “ Dad,” the
Leaning on the arm of his sister, he nodded
pleasantly to the occupant of each bed.
Murrumbidgee
Whaler, treated little
Quigley with grotesque con-
descension, and had even
less scruples than the rest
of us about asking him to
perform little services for
them. But Quigley seemed to take it
all as a matter of course, and, naturally this
made us think still less of him and impose upon
him still more.
He was the Brownie of the ward. You
heard his footstep beside your bed at earliest
dawn, as he came to remove the little wooden
looker on legs, in which you were supposed to
stow away your spare shirt, your comb, tooth-
brush, hair-brush, butter and eggs brought you by
your friends, pen and ink, books, boots—if you
were amongst the patients permitted to get up—
pipe and tobacco, towel, soap, jam, and other
articles necessary to your comfort. As you were
sure to fall into the hospital habit of rooting in
this looker, a dozen times a day, to find some
article which was certain to be at the very bottom
of the box, it fol- j
lowed that after , p
yon had been a f I
few days in the I I \
ward the con- \
tents of your \
locker became '
consider ably
mixed. But you
got used to this, and
many other thingsmuch
stranger, before you were
long in the hospital.
I know of no place, not
having been in gaol .up to
the present date, to compare
with a hospital \jjard as a school of practical philo-
sophy. While there you have to choose at once
between being a philosopher and a nuisance.
If yon choose to be a nuisance you are sure to be
sorry for it before you are much older. They see
to that. The medical student who is told off to
work your stiff leg about —passive motion is the
phrase they use to describe this operation—
twists it the wrong way until you scream.
Then the head nurse comes over to your bed
and tells you that if you do that again you will be
sent to the Refractory Ward. This is the ward
in which delirium tremens patients are kept,
howling horribly. It is much better to be a philo-
sopher at once.
This by the way.
Quigley removed the lockers in order to sweep
the floor of the ward. After this was done he
brought around the mugs which were to contain
the tea allowed for breakfast. When breakfast
was over, he cleared away the plates and mugs,
helped to wash up, and was then ready to do any-
thing for anybody. Was it any wonder that we
looked down on him?
• # »
He told us his story one day after he had
been a week or so in the ward. It was almost
ludicrously pathetic. Bad luck had dogged him
from his birth. He was a horse-breaker —the
term became full of ironic significance when he
went on to say that he had had his legs broken, his
ribs fractured half-a-dozen times, and the hunch
we saw placed on his back in the pursuit of his
profession.
“ It seems to me, old man, that the horses did
most of the breaking,” said the Comic Singer.
Little Quigley smiled, and observed that he
wouldn’t have cared so much
for these accidents if
they hadn’t thrown him
out of work for months
[ Being idle, he said, made
Bjk him sick.
Then he told us
about his sister, who
\ was a widow with
a large family, and had only him to look to for
support. He, himself, had never married. “Too
ugly,” he explained, with a grin.
“And what’s the matter with you now?” en-
quired another patient.
“ Cancer in the tongue,” he replied, quietly.
# # #
That very morning the eminent honorary
surgeon who visited Ward Z examined Quigley.
Shortly afterwards the hospital barber came to
shave him.
Then we knew what was going to happen.
“When is it to take place?” I enquired.
“ This afternoon,” he answered.
“ What did the doctor say ?”
“ Said he would have to cut out the whole of the
tongue.”
“ Did he say anything about the operation being
dangerous, or not?”
Quigley nodded gravely in the affirmative.
We saw him walk down towards the
operating theatre that afternoon. He smiled
bravely as he passed us, and waved his hand.
“What do you think of him, now?” I said to
the ward humourist.
“I think he’s worth the whole gang of us,” was
the reply, delivered in such morose tones that I
knew the humourist had been touched in a tender
spot for once,
* # *
When Quigley was brought up again from
the theatre, he was placed in the special ward—a
small room at one end of the large ward, set apart
for critical cases. A nurse was in constant attend-
ance on him. When we asked her how he was
getting on, she shook her head, and said that he
was very weak and might or might not pull
through—she didn’t, for her own part, think that
he would.
His sister visited him every day at this time.
She was evidently very fond of him, but was a
melancholy creature to look at.
Quigley had been three days in bed, when I
awoke at dawn to find him by my bedside in the
act of removing my locker out of the way before
commencing to sweep the floor !
His jaws were swathed in a great white bandage,
and for a moment I thought I was gazing at his
ghost.
When he saw that I was awake he nodded, and
smiled with his eyes.
“Good God, man,” I exclaimed, “what brings
you up like this —in your condition? ”
He took a little slate out of his pocket and
wrote on it—“ Lying in bed makes me sick.”
• • *
He worked, as before, about the ward,
and, after a day or two, was allowed to go out
and walk in the garden..
“ Did the doctors say this operation would be
sufficient ?” I asked him one day.
He shook his head, then wrote on his slate—
“ They say cancer will grow again. Told me I
wouldn’t live more than six months longer.”
Fancy walking about under a sentence of death,
to be executed at the end of six months 1 And nob
death merely, but a death of agony !
Yet little Quigley went about smiling as cheer-
fully with his eyes as though his jaws were bound
up merely on account of a gumboil.
A few days after this conversation he left the
hospital. He walked down the ward towards the
door, leaning on the arm of his sister, who knew
nothing of the doom that hung over him, and
nodding pleasantly to the occupant of each bed as
he passed. Deformed, ugly, insignificant as he
was in body, the soul that looked out of his brave
little blue eyes shone so superbly and indomitably
at this moment that we felt as if we were looking
at a being of a superior order.
And so we were.
“ Good-bye, Little Big-Heart! ” said the Oomio
Singer with a break in his voice.
And as Little Big-Heart I shall always remem-
ber Little Quigley.

Lake Eliza.
( Commonly pronounced “ Elizer.”)
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The sand was heavy on our feet,
A Christmas sky was o’er us,
And half a mile through dust and heat
Lake ’Liza lay before us.
“ You’ll have a long and heavy tramp ”
So said the last adviser—
“ You can’t do better than to camp
To-night at Lake Eliza.”
We quite forgot our aching shanks,
A cheerful spirit caught us ;
We thought of green and shady banks,
We thought of pleasant waters.
’Neath sky as niggard of its rain
As of his gold the miser—
By mulga scrub and lignum plain
We’d tramp’d to Lake Eliza.
A patch of grey, discoloured sand,
A fringe of tufty “grasses,”
A lonely pub. in mulga scrub
Is all the stranger passes.
He’ll pass the Lake a dozen times,
And yet be none the wiser;
I hope that I shall never be
As dry as Lake Eliza.
No patch of green nor water seen
To cheer the weary plodder ;
The grass is tough as fepcing-wire,
And just as good for fodder.
And when I see it mentioned in
Some local Auvkrtiskk,
’Twill make me laugh, or make me grin—
The name of “Lake Eliza.”

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Blazin’ Star, from Boston city—Yankee goods and
kerosene,
Foreign crow and cook and master, stout, old-
fashioned brigantine.
Hamburg-built and rigged and coppered ’fore the
flying days of steam ;
Square in bows, and starn, and steady; well-set
spars and broad o’ beam.
Rolled across the rough Atlantic, round the
“ Cape ” and round the “ Horn,”
Been a famous ocean-trader ’fore the “younger
age ” was born.
Carried corn and carried sugar, carried cotton,
carried tea;
Sailed in ev’ry kind o’ water, weathered storm
and wind and sea,
Been to Behring Straits a-whaling, been for rice
to Singapore,
Been to North and South, and round it, but she’s
never been ashore.
See’er “manifest,” m’ hearties, piles and piles
o’ hardware stock,
Case and crate and box and package—rammed
her, jammed her chokker-blook.
So you’ll get them shore lines ready, now they’ve
run ’er numbers out,
And the man that isn’t willing he can face to
right-about.
For the agent’s got to send ’er down to Callao
with shale,
And well empty and well fill ’er in a fortnight—
and she’ll sail.
Heave away! you damn Dutch devils, and we’ll
heave away ashore.
She ’as lost a bit o’ canvas, and ’er planks is
weather-wore;
Ease ’er ’ed and round her gently. Put the
fenders out, I say.
Pass that line a trifle forrard, let ’er ’ave a bit o’
way.
By the livin’ ghost, M'Ginnis, if I ’ave to talk to
you ;
Steady, steady ! all together ! ’Nother turn —
there, that’ll do.
Round the Horn, and none the worse, sir, crew
and captain safe and sound,
Bar a Swede —there’s plenty of ’em —he went over-
board and drowned.
Bless me soul! there ain’t a vessel hardly ever
comes to port,
Be the passage what it may be, but the list is
someone short.
Someone slips from shrouds or mainyard; block
hits someone on the ’ed —
What the devil does it matter ’long ’as someone’s
safely dead ?
Get yer tackle right and ready, strip, ye lazy sin-
ners, strip,
Blazin Star’s my boat, I reckon. I’m the boss of
this yere ship.
I’m the foreman, don’t forget it! and, be-gawd,
I’ll let yez know
Who is who and “ over hatches ” when the winch
begins to go.
Cook ’as got some baked beans doin’, bit o’ pork
to give ’em tone,
Foreign captain, fond o’ livin’, Blazin Star’s a
boat to own.
Dam Protection ! lots o’ ’baooa stowed in corners
here and there;
Want to get it safe ashore, sir ? foreman, he’s the
man to square.
Customs cove is sharp and surly; won’t accept
the mate’s invite
Down to dinner in the cabin, won’t “ come back
on board to-night.”
Friend o’ mine, e’s got a dingy—very dark, I guess,
at ten—
’Ave the ’bacca ready forrad, see what we can do
by then ?
Blazin’ Star, from Boston city, break the hatches
fore and aft,
'Twill not be the first occasion hatch was broke
on this same craft.
Sailed the Star myself in “sixty,” that was twenty
year before.
Women, booze, and seaman’s worries made me try
my luck ashore.
Sailed the Star with Yankee captain round to New
Orleans and back,
“ Blued ” a cheque among the French girls, got a
touch o’ “ Yaller Jack ”
Oh, she’s staunch and stout and steady, and she’s
got the proper grit,
You should see ’er—reefed to “ royals ’’—dip ’er
damn Dutch nose in it.
You should see ’er washed with waters from er
bowsprit to ’er starn,
Rise and shake ’erself upon ’em ’sif she didn’t care
a darn.
Pat M'Ginnis, pub yer coat on, PUT IT ON ! ! you
loafing sod !
Thought I wasn’t looking, did you ? but you can t
’ave me, begawd.
Don’t I catch you broaching cargo? When I
start to steal a hat
I won’t set about it, sonny, in a clumsy way like
that.
Yes ! she’s reckoned small and ugly, as they build
’em nowadays,
But she’s strong as ever floated from ’er keelson to
’er stays ;
North and south and round about it, sail ’er near
or sail ’er far,
Any flag you send ’er under, she’ll come back the
Blazin’ Star.
East and west, and let ’er ’ave it ; give ’er all the
sail she’ll take,
Blazin’ Star will fetch ’er cargo, or ’er bloomin’

Now, me lads, the Dutchman’s waiting—wants to

’Fore he comes ashore “ on business ” “choost for

Gets up town and, drinking whisky, treating Sis

“ Half-an-hour ” will spread till morning—boozy

Boozy crew, ashore till midnight; lots of ladies

Lots of foreign friends to meet ’em ; lot o’ folks to
take ’em down.
What’s the odds? The sailor’s happy; let him
live a week or two;
Junk and biscuit makes him moody—not the tack
for me and you !
What’s the odds if someone robs him ? Let the

Robbed he will be, soon or later, so you see it’s all

Hi, there ! Yonsen ; move yer body—l’m the

Blazin’ Star from Boston city, port to port in

With the sea salt, white and sparkling, crusted

Rolled around the North Atlantic, tossed about
by day and night,
Weather-wore, mayhap a trifle,' but she’s spar
and timber tight,
Square o’ bows and starn, and steady ; she’s the
proper kind of grit
You should see ’er —reefed to royals—dip’er damn

You should see ’er “ waller ” through ’em at a

With the winds o’ hell behind ’er on the night they

Blazin’ Star ain’t built for sinking—good old-
fashioned brigantine.

A TRULY GREAT MAN: A MID-
PACIFIC SKETCH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.)
While the flag of “Bobby” Towns, of
Sydney, was still mighty in the Ellice, Kingsmill
and Gilbert Groups, life there was not what it is to-
day. No steamers with brass-bound officers carry-
ing tin boxes and taking orders, like merchants’
barmen, for goods “to arrive,” exploited the
ocean then. Bluff-bo wed old wave-punchers like
th ■ Spec, the Lady Alicia, and the E. K. Bateson
plunged their lumbersome hulls into the roll-
ing swell of the mid-Pacific, carrying their
44 trade ” of knives, axes, guns, bad rum,
and good tobacco; instead of, as now, white
umbrellas, paper boots
and shoes, German sew-
ing-machines and
fancy prints
“zephyrs,” the
sm ar 11 y - dressed
superca r go calls them,
as he submits a card
of patterns to Emilia,
the native - teacher’s
wife, who, as the Fi st
Laly inthj Laud, must
have first choice.
In those days rtf-
the fat-faced /0
native missionary
was an unknown
quantity in the
Tokelaus and
Kingsmills, and SrM
the local white mh
trader answered all ,*/
requirements. He ffl
was generally a ! (|
rough character —a
runaway from some
Australian or Ameri- vr —
can whaler, or a wan-
dering Ishmael who, for
reasons of his own, pre-
ferred living among
the intractable, bawling
and poverty - stricken
people of the equatorial
Pacific to dreaming
away his days in the m m '.onously happy valleys
of the Society and Marquesas groups.
Such a man was Probyn, who dwelt on one
of the low atolii of the Ellice Islands. He had
landed there one day from a Sydney whaler with
a chest of clothes, a musket or two, and a tierce of
tobacco ; also, a savage-eyed, fierce-looking native
wife, over whose shoulders fell long waves of
black hair, and a child about five years old.
The second mate of the whaler, who was in charge
of the boat, not liking the looks of the natives that
swarmed around the new-comer, bade him a
hurried farewell, and pushed away to the ship,
which lay-to off the passage with her fore-yard
aback. Then the clamorous natives pressed more
closely around Probyn and his wife, and assailed
them with questions.
So far neither of them had spoken. Pro-
byn, a tall, wiry, scanty - haired man, was
standing with one foot on the tierce of tobacco
and his hands in his pockets. His wife glared
defiantly at some two or three score of women
who crowded eagerly around her to stare into her
face ; holding to the sleeve of her dress was the
child, paralysed into the silence of fright.
• # *
The deafening babble and frantic gesticu-
lations were perfectly explicable to Probyn, and
he apprehended no danger. The head man of the
town had not yet appeared, and until he came this
wild license of behaviour would continue. At
last the natives became silent and parted to the
right and loft as Tahori, the head-man, his fat
body shining with cocoanut-oil and carrying an
ebony-wood club, stood in front of the white man
and eyed him up and down. The scrutiny seemed
satisfactory. He stretched out his huge, naked
arm and shook Probyn’s hand, uttering his one
word of Samoan —Talofal and then, in his own
dialect, he asked : 44 What is your name, and what
do you want ?”
“Sam, replied Probyn. And then, in the
Tokelau language, which the wild-eyed people
around him fairly understood, 44 1 have come here
to live with you and trade for oil ’’—and he
pointed to the tierce of tobacco.
44 Whore are you from ?”
“From the land called Nukunono, in the
Tokelau.”
44 Why come here?”
44 because I killed someone there.”
44 Good 1” grunted the fat man, 44 there are no
twists in your tongue; but why did the boat
hasten away so quickly ?”
44 They were frightened because of the noise.
He with the face like a fowl’s talked too much ”■—
and he pointed to a long, hatchet-visaged native,
who had been especially turbulent and vociferous.
• • •
“Ha!” and the fat, bearded face of
Tahori turned from the white man to him of whom
the white man had spoken— 44 Is it thee, Makoi?
And so thou madest the strangers hasten away !
That was wrong. Only for thee I had gone to the
sliip and gotten many things. Come here !”
Then he stooped and picked up one of Probyn’s
muskets, handed it to the white man, and silently
indicated the tall native with a nod. The other
natives fell back. Niabong, Probyn’s wife, set
her boy on his feet, put her hand in her bosom
and drew out a key, with which she opened the
chest. She threw back the lid, fixed her black
eyes on Probyn, and waited.
Probyn, holding the musket in his left hand,
mused a moment. Then he asked :
44 Whose man is he?”
44 Mine,” said Tahori, 44 he is from Oaitupu, and
my bondman.”
44 Has he a wife ?”
“No, he is poor and works in my puraka fie’d.”
“Good,” said Probyn, and he motioned to his
wife. She dived her hand into the chest and
handed him a tin of powder, then a bullet, a cap
and some scraps of paper.
Slowly he loaded the musket, and Tahori, seizing
the bondman by his arm, led him out to the open,
and stood by, club in hand, on the alert.
Probyn knew his reputation depended on the
shot. The ball passed through the chest of
M vkoi. Then four men picked up the body and
carried it into a house.
* • *
Probyn laid down the musket and
motioned again to Niabong. She handed him a
hatchet and blunt chisel. Tahori smiled plea-
santly, and drawing the little boy to him patted
his head.
Then, at a sign from him, a woman brought
Niabong a shell of sweet toddy. The chief sat
cross-legged on the ground and watched
Frobyn opening the tierce of tobacco.
Niabong locked the box again and
sat upon it.
“Probyn knew his reputation depended
on the shot.”
“Who are you?” said Tahori, still
caressing the boy.
“Niabong. But my tongue twists
with your talk here. lam of Naura
(Pleasant Island). By and bye I will
understand it.”
44 True. He is a great man, thy man,” said the
chief, nodding at Probyu.
44 A great man, truly. There is not one thing in
the world but he can do it.”
44 E moe,” said the fat man approvingly, “I can
see it. Look you, he shall be as my brother, and
thy child here shall eat of the best in the land.”
I’robyn came over with his two hands filled
with sticks of tobacco. 44 Bring a basket,” he
said.
A young native girl slid out from the
cocoanuts at Tahori’s bidding and stood behind
him, holding a basket. Frobyn counted out into
it two hundred sticks.
44 See, Tahori, lam a just man to thee because
thou art a just man to me. Here is the price of
him that thou gavest to me.”
Tahori rose and beckoned to the people to
return — 44 Look at this man. He is a great man.
His heart groweth from his loins upward to his
throat. Bring food to my house quickly, that he
and his wife and child may eat. And to-morrow
shall every man cut wood for the house, a house
that shall be in length ten fathoms and five
in width. Such men as he come from the gods.”

THE DOCTOR’S WIFE: CONSAN-
GUINITY—FROM A POLYNESIAN
STANDPOINT.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“ Oho !” said Lagisiva, the widow, tossing
her hair back over her shoulders, as she raised the
heavy, fluted tappa mallet in her thick, strong
right hand, and dealt the tappa cloth a series of
quick strokes— 44 Oho! ” said the dark-faced
Lagisiva, looking up at the White Man, 44 because
Ibe a woman dost think me a fool ? I toll thee I
know some of the customs of the papalagi— the
white foreigners. Much wisdom have ye in many
things; but again I tell thee, O friend of my sons,
that in some other things the people of thy
nation, ay, of all white nations, they be as
the beasts of the forest—the wild goat and pig—
without reason and without shame. Tah ! Has not
my eldest son, Tui Fau, whom the white men call
Bob, lived for seven years in Sini (Sydney), when
he returned from those places by New Guinea
where he was diver? And he has filled my ears
with the bad and shameless customs of the
papalagi. Tah ! I say again thy women have
not the shame of ours. The heat of desire
devoureth chastity even in those of one blood.”
“In what do they offend, O my mother ? ”
44 Aue I Life is short; and, behold, this piece of
siapo is for a wedding-present, and I must hurry ;
but yet put down thy gun and bag and we shall
smoke awhile, and thou shalt feel shame while I
tell of one of the papalagi customs—the marrying
of brother and sister.”
“Nay, mother,” said the White Man, 44 not
brother and sister, but only cousins.”
“Tah!” and the big widow spat scornfully on
the ground, 44 those are words, words. It is the
same; the same is the blood, the same is the bone.
Even in our heathen days we pointed the finger at
one who looked with the eye of love on the daughter
of his father’s brother or sister—for such did we let
his blood out upon the sand. And I, old Lagisiva,
have seen a white man brought to shame through
this wickedness.”
“ Tell me,” said the White Man.
* # *
“He was a foma'i (doctor) and rich,
and came here because he desired to see
strange places, and was weary of his life in the
land of the papalagi. So he remained with us
and hunted the wild boar with our young men
and became strong and hardy and like unto one of
our people. And then, because he was forever
restless, he sailed away once and returned in a
small ship and brought back trade and built a
store and a fine house to dwell in. The chief of
this town gave him, for friendship, a piece of land
over there by the Yaitamilo, and thus did he
become a still greater man ; his store was full of
rich goods, and he kept many servants, and at
night-time his house was as a blaze of fire, for
the young men and women would go there and
sing and dance, and he had many lovers amongst
our young girls.
“I, old Lagisiva, that am now fat and dull, was
one. Oho, he was a man of plenty ! Did a girl
but look out between her eyelashes at a piece of
print in the store, lo ! it was tier’s, even though it
measured twenty fathoms in length—and print
was a dollar a fathom in those days. So every
girl—even those from parts far off—cast herself in
his way, that he might notice her. And he was
generous to all alike -in that alone was wisdom.
« • *
“Once or twice everyyeartheshipsbrought
him letters. And he would count the marks on
the paper, and tell us that they came from a
woman of the papalagi— his cousin, as you would
call her —whose picture was hung over his table.
She was forever smiling down upon us, and her
eyes were his eyes, and, if he but smiled, then
were the two alike —alike as are two children of
the same birth. When three years had come
and gone a ship brought him a letter, and
that night there were many of us at his house,
men and women, to talk with the men from the
ship. When those had gone away to their sleep,
he called to the chief and said :
44 4 ln two days, O my friend, I set out for my
land again ; but to return, for much do I desire to
remain with you always. In six months I shall be
“ When we drew dose to hr we saw it was the woman in the picture—his sister/"
here again. And there is one thing I would speak
of. I shall bring back a white wife, a woman of my
own country whom 1 have loved for many years.’
“Then the chief, who was my father’s father and
very old, said, ‘ She shall be my daughter, and
welcome,’ and many of us young girls said also,
‘ she shall be welcome ’—although we felt sorrowful
to lose a man so good and open-handed. And then
did the fotna'i call to the old chief and two others,
and they entered the store and lit lamps, and pre-
sently a man went forth into the village and cried
aloud, 4 Come hither, all people, and listen 1’ So,
many hundreds came, and we all went in. The
floor was covered with some of everything that the
white man possessed. And the chief spoke and
said :
“‘Behold, my people, this our good friend
goeth away, that he may bring back a wife.
And because many young unmarried girls will say
‘Why does he leave us-are not we as good to
look upon as this other woman ? ’ does he put
these presents here on the ground and these words
into my mouth—‘ Out of his love to you which must
be a thing that is past and forgotten, the wife
that is coming must not know of some little things
—that is papalagi custom.’ v
“ And then every girl that had a wish took
whatever she fancied, and the white man charged
us to say naught that would arouse the anger of
the wife that was to come. And so he departed.
# * *
“One hundred and ten fat hogs killed we
and roasted whole for the feast of welcome. I
swear it by the Holy Ones of God’s Kingdom—
one hundred and ten. And yet this white lily of
his never smiled—not even on us young girls who
danced and sang before her, only she clung to his
arm and, behold, when we drew close to her we
saw it was the woman in the picture—his sister !
“And then one byone all those that had gathered
to do him honor went away in shame—shame that
he should do this, wed his own sister, and many
women said worse of her. But yet the feast —the
hogs and yams and taro and fish and fowls—was
brought and placed by his doorstep, but no one
spake, and at night-time he was alone with his
wife, till he sent for the old chief, and reproached
him with bitter words for the coldness of the
people, and asked ‘ Why is this?’
* • *
“And the old man pointed to the picture
over the table, and said 4 Is this she—thy wife ?’
“ 4 Ay,’ said the white man.
“ ‘ Is she not of the same blood as thyself?’
444 Even so,’ said he.
“ 4 Then shalt thou live alone in thy shame,’
said the old man ; and he went away.
44 So, for many months, these two lived. He
found some to work for him, and some young girls
to tend his sister, whom he called his wife, whilst
she lay ill with her first child. And the day after
it was born, someone whispered, 4 He is accursed !
the child cries not —it is dumb.’ For a week
it lived, yet never did it cry, for the curse of
wickedness was upon it. Then the white man
nursed her tenderly, and took her away to live in
Fiji for six months. When they came back it
was the same—no one cared to go inside his house,
and he cursed us, and said he would bring men
from Tokelau to work for him. We said naught.
Then in time another child was born, and it was
hideous to look upon, and that also died.
* * *
“ Now, there was a girl amongst us whose
name was Suni, to whom the white woman spoke
much, for she was learning our tongue, and Suni,
by reason of the white woman’s many presents,
spoke openly to her, and told her of the
village talk. Then the white woman wept, and
arose and spoke to the man for a long while. And
she came back to Suni and said, 4 What thou hast
told me was in my own heart three years ago ;
yet, because it is the custom of my people,
I married this man, who is the son of my
father’s brother. But now I shall go away.’
Then the white man came out and beat Suni
with a stick. But yet was his sister, whom he
called his wife, eaten up with shame, and when a
ship came they went away and we saw her not
again. For about two years we heard no more of
our white man, till ho returned and said the
woman was dead. And ho took Suni for wife*


who bore him three children, and then they went
away to some other country—l know not where. 14

“I thank thee, many, many times, 0
friend of my sons. Four children of mine here
live in this village, yet not a one of them ever asks
me when I smoked last. May God walk with
thee for this stick of tobacco.”
LOUIS BECKE.
THE METHODICAL MR. BURR.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
One day, Ned Burr, a fellow - trader,
walked slowly up the path to my station, and
with a friendly nod sat down and watched
intently as, with native assistance, I set about
salting some pork. Ned lived thirty miles from
my place, on a little island at the entrance to
the lagoon He was a prosperous man, and
only drank under the pressure of the mono-
tony caused by the non-arrival of a ship to
buy his produce. He would then close his store,
and, aided by a number of friendly male natives,
start on a case of gin. But never a woman went into
Ned’s house, though many visited the store,
“ I made her walk in front of me. Every time she
dropped the head I slewed her round and
made her lift it up again.”
where Ned bought their produce, paid for it in
trade or cash, and sent them off, after treating
them on a strictly business basis.
m m m
Now the Marshall Island women much re-
sented this. Since Ned’s wife had died, ten years
previously, the women, backed by the chiefs, had
made most decided but withal diplomatic assaults
upon his celibacy. The old men had respectfully
reminded him that his state of singleness was a
direct slight to themselves as leading men. If he
refused to marry again he surely would not cast
such a reflection upon the personal characters of
some two or three hundred young girls, as to
refuse a few of them the position of honorary
wives pro tem., or until he saw some one of them
whom he might think worthy of higher honors.
But the elow-thiuking, methodical trader only
opened a bottle of gin, gave them fair words and
a drink all round, and absolutely declined to open
any sort of matrimonial negotiations.
mm#
“ I’m come to hev some talk with you,
when you’ve finished saltin’,” he said, as he
lose and meditatively jtrodded a junk of meat
with his forefinger.
“ Right, old man,” I said. “ I’ll come now
and we went into the big room and sat down,
“ Air ye game ter come and see me get married ?”
he asked, looking away past me, through the open
door, to where the surf thundered and tumbled
on the outer reef.
“Ned,” I said, solemnly, “I know you don’t
joke; so you must mean it. Of course I will. I’m
sure all of us fellows will be delighted to hoar
you’re going to get some nice little carajz to lighten
up that big house of yours over there. Who’s the
girl, Ned?”
“ Le-jennabon.”
“ Whew 1” I said, “why, she’s the daughter of
the biggest chief on Arhnu. I didn’t think any
white man could get her, even if he gave her
people a boat-load of dollars as a wedding-gift.”
“Well, no,” said Ned, stroking his beard medi-
tatively, “I suppose I should feel a bit setup;
but two years ago her people said that, because I
stood to them in the matter of some rifles when
they had trouble, I could take her. She was rather
young then, anyway, but I’ve been over to Arhnu
several times, and I’ve had spies out, and damn
mo if I ever could hear a whisper against her. I’m
t.dd for sure that her father and uncles would ha’
killed anyone that came after her. So I’m a-goin
to take her and chance it.”
“Ned,” I said, “you know your own affairs
and these people better than I do. Are you
really going to pin your faith on a Marshall
Island girl? You are not like any of us
traders. Y r ou see, we know what to expect
sometimes; and our morals are a lot worse than
those of the natives. And it doesn’t harrow our
feelings much if any one of us has to divorce a
wife and get another) It only means a lot of new
dresses and some guzzling, drinking, and speechi-
fying, and some bother In teaching the new wife
how to make bread. But your wife that died was
a Manhikian—another kind. They don’t breed
that sort here in the Marshalls. Think of it
twice, Ned, before you marry her.”
• m m
The girl was a beauty. There are many
like her in that far-away cluster of coral atolls.
That she was a chief’s child it was easy to
see; the abject manner in which the commoner
natives always behaved themselves in her pre-
sence showed their respect for Le-jennabon. Of
course we all got very jolly. There were half-a-
dozen of us traders there and we were, for a
wonder, all on friendly terms. Le-jennabon sat
on a-fine mat in the big room, and in a sweetly
dignified manner received the wedding gifts. One
of our number, Charlie de Buis, though in a state
of chronic poverty, induced by steadfast
adherence to square gin at five dollars a
case, made his offerings—a gold locket cover-
ing a woman’s miniature, a heavy gold ring, and
a pair of fat cross-bred Muscovy ducks. The
bride accepted them with a smile. “Who is this?”
she asked, looking at the portrait—
“your white wife?”
“No,” replied the bashful
Charles, “another man’s. That’s
.why I give it away, curse her.
/ But the ducks I bred
\ myself on Mad uro.”
A month or
cwo passed.
Then, on one
Sunday after-
noon, about
dusk, I saw
Ned’s whale-
boat coming
over across the
lagoon. I met
.i i m on the
beach. Trouble
was in his
face, yet his
hard, impas-
sive features
were such that
only those who
knew him well
could discover
it. Instead of
entering the
house, he si-
lently motion-
ed me to come
further along the
sand where we reached an open spot clear of
cocoanuts. Ned sat down and filled his pipe. I
waited patiently. The wind had died away, and
the soft swish and swirl of the tide as the ripples
lapped the beach was the only sound that broke
upon the silence of the night.
“ You were right. Bub it doesn’t matter
now ” He laughed softly. “A week
ago a canoe-party arrived from Ebon. There were
two chiefs. Of course, they came to my house to
trade. They had plenty of money. There were
about a hundred natives belonging to them. The
younger man was chief of Likieb —a flash buck.
The first day he saw Le-jenuabon he had a lot too
much to say to her. I watched him. Next
morning my toddy-cutter came and told me that
the flash young chief from Likieb had stuck him
up and drunk my toddy, and had said something
about my wife —you know how they talk in
parables when they mean mischief. 1 would have
shot him for the toddy racket, but I was waitin’
for a better reason. . . The old hag who bosses
my cook-shed said to me as she passed, ‘Go
and listen to a song of cunning over there
pointing to a clump of breadfruit trees. I walked
over —quietly. Le-jennabon and her girls were
sitting down on mats. Outside the fence was a
lad singing this—in a low voice—
Marriage hides the tricks of lovers.
Le-jennabon and the girls bent their heads and
said nothing. Then the devil’s imp commenced
again :
Marriage hides the tricks of lovers.
Some of the girls laughed and whispered to Le-
jennabou. She shook her head, and looked around
timorously. Plain enough, wasn’t it? Presently,
the boy crept up to the fence, and dropped over a
wreath of yellow blossoms. The girls laughed.
One of them picked it up, and offered it to
Le-jennabon. She waved it away. Then, again,
the cub outside sang softly—
Marriage hides the tricks of lovers,
and they all laughed again, and Le-jennabon put
the wreath on her head, and I saw the brown
hide of the boy disappear among the trees.
# * *
“ 1 went back to the house. I wanted to
make certain she would follow the boy first.
After a few minutes, some of Le-jennabon’s women
came to me, and said they were going to the
weather side—it’s narrer across, as you know—to
pick flowers. I said all right, to go, as I was
going to do something else, so couldn’t come. Then
I went to the trade-room and got what I wanted.
The old cook-hag showed me the way they had
gone, and grinned when she saw what I had slid
down inside my pyjamas. I cut round and came
to the place. I had a right good idea where it
was. They soon came along the path and then
stopped and talked to Le-jennabon and pointed to
aclump of breadfruit-treesstanding in an arrowroot-
patch. She seemed frightened—but went. Half-
way through, she stopped, and then I saw my
beauty raise his head from the ground and inarch
over to her. I jest giv’ him time ter enjoy a smile
and then I stepped out and toppled him over.
Eight through his carcass—them Sharp’s rifles
make a hole you could put your fist into.
41 The girl dropped, too—sheer funk. Old
Lebauro, the cook, slid through the trees and stood
over him, and said ‘He’s a fine-made man,’ and
gave me her knife; and then I collared Le-jenna*
bon and ”
“For God’s sake, Ned, don’t tell me you killed
her too 1 ”
He shook his head slowly.
“No, I couldn’t hurt her. But I held her with
one hand, she feeling dead and cold, like a wet
deck-swab; then the old cook-woman undid my
flash man’s long hair, and, twining her skinny old
claws in it, pulled it taut, while I sawed at the
chap’s neck with my right hand. The knife was
heavy and sharp and I soon got the job through.
Then I gave the thing to Le-jennabon to carry,
* * *
“ I made her walk in front of me. Every
time she dropped the head I slewed her round and
made her lift it up again. And the old cook-devil
trotted astern o’ us. When we came close to the
town I says to Le-jennabon :
“ * Do you want to live ?’
“ ‘Yes,’ says she, in a voice like a whisper.
“ ‘ Then sing,’ says I, ‘ sing loud —
* Marriage hides the tricks of lovers.’
And she sang it in a choky kind of quaver.
“ There was a great rush o’ people ter see the
procession. They stood in a line on both sides of
the path and stared and said nothin’.
“ Presently we comes to where all the Likieb
chief’s people was quartered. They knew the
head and ran back for their rifles, but my crowd
in the village was too strong, and, o’ course, sided
with me, and took away their guns. Then the
crowd gathers round my place and I makes Le-
jennabon hold up the head and sing again—sing
that devil’s chant.
“‘Listen,’ I says to the people, ‘listen to my
wife singing a love-song.’ Then I takes the thing,
wet and bloody, and slings it into the middle of
the Likieb people, and gave Le-jennabon a push
and sent her inside.”
# • «
I was thinking what would be the best
thing to say and could only manage “It’s a bad
business, Ned.”
“Bad! That’s where you’re wrong,” and,
rising, Ned brushed the sand off the legs of his
pyjamas. “It’s just about the luckiest thing as
could ha’happened. Ye see, it’s given Le-jennabon
a good idea'of what may happen to her if she
ain’t mighty cor-rect. An’ it’s riz me a lot in the
esteem of the people generally as a man who has
business principles.”

True Till Death.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
A heated discussion was proceeding as I rode
up to the slab-built Kangaroo Camp Hotel, A
policeman and five or six others on the verandah
were all talking at once, and seemed to be
abusing one who sat on a stone a little way off.
He was a feeble-looking old fellow, and had evi-
dently been drinking, for his hands were shaky
and his eyes were bloodshot. But he was defend-
ing himself fluently, and with the gratified air of
a man who knew he had done his duty.
“Me do a thing like that to Bill! ” he was say-
ing. “Why, Bill an’ me was mates 40 years ago.
We was at Tambaroora together. We was at
Lambing Flat together, me an’ Bill, an’ Bendigo
an’ on the Palmer. I’ve knowed Bill since he was’
a nipper, so high ! An’ Bill never did nothing
mean to me. An’ you think I’d go now an’ inter-
fere with Bill! You ain’t no belter than a lot of
things, you ain’t! ”
I stabled my horse, and walked in through the
back to the parlour, and there, at full length on
the table, was a dead man. He was fully dressed,
and his face was purple. I went outside,
promptly, to the verandah, and the policeman
explained.
“ This old bloke and him inside have been on
the booze here for a fortnight, and the other one,
he got the horrors, and hung himself to-day with
his saddle-strap. These coves here found him
hanging, quite dead, and there was this old tug
sitting on a box alongside, calmly looking on !
And he says he saw the cove hang himself, and
watched him struggling ”
“Yes,” said the old man, “ Bill did jump about
a bit.”
“ Watched him kick and jump and play up for
I don’t know how long, and the balmy old fool —
he must be balmy—never told anybody, nor cut
him down, nor nothing !”
This started the old man again.
“Me cut him down ! Me ! Bill’s old mate !
Don’t I tell you Bill an’ we’s been mates for 40
year? Me interfere witli old Bill! Not me!
Bill wasn’t the sort of man to turn dog on an old
mate, and I ain’t neither. An’ Bill and me was
always good friends. I noo Bill before any of you
coves was born. Why, I knew his father I
A CHEE.
The Unseen City.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
There is an unseen city
As old as Babylon,
Where creatures dwell in narrow holes,
Burrows and crannies dark, like moles—
Poor exiles from the sun,
The ever-wakeful stars, the blessed moon,
Seeing no glory in the night or noon.
It is no black banditti
That swarm those countless dens
Where spiders weave above the head,
With rats and mice beneath the bed;
Nor are the regions fens,
Nor do the inmates love the efts and toads
And pestilential air of these unknown abodes.
Are they of monstrous features,
Elf, oaf, or bedlamite,
Who, swoll’n with sloth, obscenely roll
’Midst filth and gloam and odours foul,
Cursing and cursed by light ?
Or can they be some nations of a land
Cast out from human eye by God’s wise hand ?
Who are the hideous creatures,
See ! palace-walls divide
As strange bell tolls. Down falls the steeple—
“ We are the wide world’s working people
Who dwell thus thrust aside.
Our city is around, beneath, behind,
And, like our myriad graves, its place no one can
find.”

The Story of Mary.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“ A story without beginning, crisis, or conclusion,
flowerless and fruitless, but ivith something of infinite
in it. ” — Meredith.
Tod was his surname. The Christian name
was believed to be John, but it had been lost in
the years, and to all intents and purposes he was
Tod and nothing else.
And Mary loved him. She was a little thing,
this Mary; a slender, flower-like creature with
eyes that Tod said were like blue-bags. Her hair
had the sunlight in it, and though the rest of her
was nothing remarkable, everybody in the street
liked to look at her.
Nobody ever knew whether Tod loved her.
Some thought he did. Others again thought not.
She was his sister’s only child, and that sister
was long since dead, and Mary had lived under
his poor old down-bent roof for nine years. She
had learned there to talk, and walk, and sing; she
had learnt there that that blue overhead was the
sky, and those little fairy lights the stars, and
that great, round, dazzling thing with long,
bright spikes that she could not look at was the
sun. And those streets outside, and the houses,
and the people that lived in them, that was the
world. And if she was good she would go up
through that far-off blue, with its great light by
day and its little light by night, and would find a
place inside called Heaven; and if she was naughty
she would go down through the earth to a nasty,
hot place, the name of which she was not told.
She learnt, too, that the flowers that grew in
the gardens, or in the park, were not for her,
pretty though they were. She knew there were
things that she might want, but might not have.
Tod taught her some of these things. Not the
theory, though, of that place behind the skies, or
that nasty place under the earth. Those were
things to which Tod, if he ever gave thought to
them, certainly never lent words.
His ethics were simple : “No God, no devil,
and 20s. in the £.” And he attended to the third
clause so well that anybody in the street would
have lent him his last farthing, and felt proud
of being able to do so.
• • •
Tod’s wife had died when Tod’s hair was
brown, and before his shoulders were bent and
stooped. That was a long, long time ago. Hardly
anyone in the street remembered it. But they
said, and they felt as if they knew it, that if she
had lived Tod would have been a different man.
Perhaps he had buried his heart in her grave, as
men in novels are said to do. At any rate, he had
lost it somewhere, and as well say there as any-
where else, for he had none now, they said.
He beat Mary regularly morning and night.
His hand was heavy, and there were often dark
marks on the whiteness of her flesh. Sometimes
at night, when all were sleeping, she would lie
awake in her little, hard bed and ache with the
pain of those purple marks. She would cry, too,
in her little, gentle, unchildlike way, and feel very
miserable and sore.
Then, perhaps, when she woke in the morning,
Tod would be standing at her bedside, and instead
of the set lips and hand raised to strike, there
would be a gentle smile and a cu.p of milk and
a piece of bread and butter with sugar on it.
Every Christmas time he bought her a doll.
Every birthday he had a cake made at the little
baker’s shop at the corner, and he and she and the
boy from next door ate it for tea. But twice he
had taken her dolls from her suddenly and given
them away to some strange children without a
word to her. And once, when he had bought the
birthday cake as usual, he had changed his mind
and locked it away in some hidden cupboard, and
she had never seen it again.
As she grew up the strangeness of tilings
dawned on her gradually. She saw in the glass
the blueness of her eyes and the lovely gleams in
her hair, and they pleased her. Why should they
not please Tod ? Why was he cruel to her one
hour and kind the next? And then crueller again
than ever.
She wondered, but she grew to womanhood
without knowing. At last she knew.
# * *
The boy next door, whose name was
Jones, was growing up, too, meanwhile. And
things were dawning on him as on Mary. The
blueness of her eyes, and the beauty of her golden
hair, and the gentleness that came from her
heart, and the truth that was part of her.
When he was 23, and Mary was 20, he found
suddenly that he was a man and Mary a woman,
and that he loved her. And he was filled with an
uncontrollable longing to know if she loved him.
Tod’s shop was lit, and Tod was behind the
counter serving tea and sugar to a woman. In
the doorway there was another figure standing, a
figure whose white dress had a piled-up heap of
sugar-bags behind it as a background. The gas
caught the lights in her hair, and shone into them,
and as Jones looked at her there, she seemed, even
to his prosaic mind, something ethereal in her
beauty.
She saw him as he came towards her, and she
blushed. He felt glad when she did that. Tod
was busy, and he whispered, “ Mary, come out on
the doorstep, I want to speak to you.”
She came out and stood in -the shadow that
the shop cast on the pavement. She looked up at
him as he looked down at her, and he saw a long
black mark across her cheek. His heart revolted
at the sight of that mark. He caught her hands.
“Mary,” he said.
“ Yes,” she answered.
“ I want to tell you something. I —l love you !
Oh, Mary, I love you.”
She left her hands in his.
“ Mary,” he said, “do you care for me? Will
you marry me some day ? ”
She was silent —she could not speak. But was
he not the boy from next door, who had kissed
her, and hit her, and eaten her birthday cake, and
cut her doll’s hair off, and played with her, and
loved her all his life? Perhaps she thought no
answer was needed. At any rate, he was satisfied,
though she said not a word.
By-and-bye they went inside to tell Tod. “He
will be glad,” said the man, but the girl was
doubtful. She never knew what Tod was going
to be—whether kind or cruel.
He had finished serving tea and sugar; he stood
behind the counter with his arms folded, and his
eyes set in deep thought. He looked up as they
came in, Mary first, and Jones after her. He
looked at Mary first; then at Jones. Then he
looked at Mary again.
His eyes remained fixed on her ; the look was
one that simply could not be described. It was
wrathful, agonised, afraid, imploring, and full of
a growing horror, all at one time. Mary shud-
dered at the awfulness of it, and her lover took
one of her hands in his to calm her. He himself
was frightened, though. That terrible, silent
look had a meaning in it, perhaps. He tried to
speak twice before his words would come. Then
his voice came back to him, strong and manly.
“Mary and I love each other,” he said, “and
she has promised, with your consent, to marry
me.”
Still Tod was silent.
They stood there in the little grocery store, with
its bright gas-light and its crowded shelVes—the
three of them. Mary and the man who loved
her and the man who had been cruel to her.
Tod’s eyes were still on Mary’s face. All the
colour had left his cheeks. Their whiteness was
appalling.
Jones spoke again. “Do you consent ?” he
asked. “ You know all about me, and I’ve
always loved her, ever since she came, I think.”
Then the look changed. Tod staggered, and
reeled back against the shelves behind him. He
shut his eyes.
“Oh, my God,” he said, “Ever since she
came. My God ! my God !”
His hands went up to his head, and he began to
rock himself to and fro. They looked on in
horror, and Mary began to cry.
At last Tod opened his eyes, and looked at)
them.
“ You must go away at once,” he said to Jones,
“ and never see her again.”
“ What?”
“ Yes ; go away at once."
"But I won’t. I refuse. What reason have
you ?”
“If I tell you, you’ll never want to set eyes on
the girl again,” said Tod, in a quavering voice.
"Shall I tell you? Yes, I’ll tell you. And you
too, Mary. I’ll tell you. Yes, yes, I’ll tell you.
I’ve tried to beat her straight, to keep her right,
and make her a good one. But 1 never thought
that anyone might want to take her from me.”
He paused again, and looked wildly at Mary.
" Your father was ’anged,” he said, slowly.
• * *
“You had best go now,” he said to Jones.
"You won’t care to marry a girl like Mary, an
’anged man’s daughter. You had best go.” His
voice fell away into a pitiful sob.
There was a long pause. Jones had spoken no
word, nor looked at Mary. She stood in silence,
and Tod was silent too. Nobody heard Mary’s
heart break, and nobody saw the sudden black
eclipse of Jones’ first sun. On, on, on, the long
silence stretched itself. Through time to the
eternities beyond. There were few minutes in U
really, yet lives seemed to open then and die.
Jones saw three visions : Respectability, Mary,
and the Rope. They warred with each other.
They tore each other to shreds. And his mind’s
eye beheld the victory of the omnipotent first.
He spoke at last, only one word, and a sad one.
“Good-bye,” he said, and went towards the
door with a step that no one would have recognised
as the step he had come in with.
# # •
And Mary never saw him again. The
story got abroad, and others in the street who
might have loved that golden head and those
tender eyes kept away and took warning by
Jones.
The hair never grew grey. Long before it was
tima for grey hairs she was missing from the little
corner shop.
The resolution of humanity into its prime
factors, and the relation of Xto Z were the pro-
blems that crushed her.

A Re-constructed Idol .
A VAGARY IN VERSE.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
There’s a certain poet, somewhere, and ho, years
ago, recorded
A sweet and pleasing fancy, which, to-day, is
fresh and green—
That, of all the sadden’d pleasures to the human
race afforded.
The saddest is reflecting on the things that
“might have been
Yet ’tis scarce a truth immortal, the’ ’tis often so
regarded,
For I guess of all sad memories, the saddest of
the lob—
To the man whose prime has perished—whom the
world has since discarded—
Are the thoughts of things that have been, which,
to-day, alas 1 are nob.
Ah, the good old days that have been 1 Is it folly
to recall them ?
Nay I more vain, perhaps, than foolish—fraught
with profit, less than pain !
And the dead past’s recollections—may we never
overhaul them—
Nor our youth’s glad, golden glories ; that shall
never come again ?
Yet!—the past may be a bogey 1 Joys, alas, are
effervescent 1
Ay, those tender recollections, after all, may
tricksters be !
And those shades that haunt the mem’ry—could
we meet them in the present—
Would the old ideals triumph ; or would fancy t
frightened, flee?
Change is Nature’s law eternal ! Time’s slow mill
is ever grinding !
Yet, how seldom we’re prepared for all the
changes Time has wrought.
Yea, the years are never idle—yet we feign sur-
prise on finding
That the Past is merged in Progress—and
existed but in thought,
And the Change, degrees may vary ! Man, I
liken to a boulder
In the bed of Life’s great river 1 It depends
upon the stuff
Of which he’s constituted, whether Time, which
leaves him older,
Also leaves him smooth and polished, or still in
his native rough !
There was Clayton—Andy Clayton—we were
working, mates together,
At Dunolly and MTvor, I forget how long ago;
Bub for years I never saw him, and I often won-
dered whether
He was still amongst the living or was planted
“down below.”
Ay, I often thought of Andy—often conjured up
our meeting—
Two old, worn-out, battered remnants, thrown
together at some “ rush,”
Or perhaps on some old workings—and I figured
out our greeting—
How we’d seal the new-found friendship in a
bucketful of “ lush.”
For the real old sort was Andy—honest lad and
hearty drinker—
And I often thought, in fancy (was the notion
quite insane ?)
How he’d hitch his yellow moleskins, how he’d
scratch his honest “thinker”—
And, with a curse, petition me to “ put it there
again.”
’Twas a fair and pleasing prospect, and my old
imagination,
Running riot o’er the subject, led my senses quite
a dance;
But it never showed me Andy in another situa-
tion—
Never clothed him but in moleskin— not by any
sorb of chance.
Well! At last. we met—in Melbourne—after
thirty years ! Bub never
In my wildest dreams of fancy, had I pictured
him like that /
Ah, the shock ! I shan’t forget it, should my life-
time last for ever—
The shook of seeing Andy— in a tall and shiny
hat I
In a brand-new hat, and glossy; in the best of
fashion’s raiment,
And with snowy, spotless linen—oh, a perfect
hog for style—
(Like those bank-chaps whose appearance is a
guarantee for payment)
Even then, I could forgive him ; if it wasn’t for
that “ tile.”
All that passed is vague and dream-like. In that
shock of revelation,
I rightly can’t remember what we did, or what
we said ;
He asked me to come homo with him—’twas handy
to the station—
And so, he took mo with him —like a lamb to
slaughter led.
He introduced his family—l stood in apprehen-
* sion
Of his wife, who made me welcome, with a sort
•of solemn state;
And his brace of stylish daughters, who displayed
much condescension,
Of an edifying nature, to their father’s old-time
mate.
Oh, their style was most imposing 1 It was awful
to behold them
As wo sat around to dinner—bho’ I fail’d with
knife and fork—
Still, I couldn’t help but wonder if thair “pa” had
ever told them
How, in olden days, he’d revel in a hunk of
pickled pork.
And I caught myself contrasting him —the Andy
of the Present,
With the Andy of MTvor—with my mate of
olden time!
Years had changed him—changed him greatly—
but the change was hardly pleasant—
I’d have sooner had the Andy of the moleskins
and the grime.
And I wondered, somewhat vaguely, if he ever
felt a longing—
In the midst of his refinement —for the careless
days of old,
When he’d shoulder-up his swag and join the
dusty army, thronging
On the road for El Dorado, in the reckless rush
for gold ?
If the thoughts of olden mem’ries ever sent the
hot blood surging;
If he mourned his days of freedom—happy days
of dare and do—
If he ever felt the frenzy—felt the fever fiercely
urging
A mad break from bricks and asphalt for the
mountain’s distant blue ?
But my doubts, disturbing, ended when he left
me at the station !
For ho shook my hand at parting, and he said—
O, pathos sweet! —
“ Lad, I envy you your freedom, ah, I miss the
old vocation—
Miss the days of old excitement, mate, when
‘ life was more than meat.’
So 1 good-bye now—in the meantime—but I’ll
look you up to-morrow ;
This meeting is our first one, but it shall not bo
our last;
I’ll see you in the morning, and an hour or two
we’ll borrow
From the Present; and we’ll revel in the
resurrected Past 1”
There are times when life is golden—when we pur-
chase pleasure cheaply!
Let the feeble fool philosophise—the worldly
cynic sneer—
Man, I know that not a sermon stirr’d me ever
half so deeply
As those words, so few and simple. Ah, the
smile was near the tear 1
For I felt I’d judged him harshly—had condemned
without a hearing
(Ah, we mete out scanty measure, be the subject
man or Fate);
I discovered Andy’s “polish” was at best but
poor veneering—
Lo I a scratch upon the surface, and—behold I
the same old mate.
TOBY TWIST
Prayer for Rain.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
It was mid-day.
The little parson dismounted, carefully buckl d
his bridle round a panel of the fence, and walked
up to the rough figure standing at the door of the
hut.
“Terribletimes,” he said, mopping his forehead.
The other looked away across the great plain,
yellow in the mingled dust and glamour of drought,
and nodded silently.
“Mr. Dawson tells me the parson always
made a point of leading up to higher things
through everyday topics—“that this loss will
almost ruin him—three thousand head of catt>e
gone in three months—and I can believe him."
He sniffed the foetid air as he spoke.
The other said nothing.
“ Mr. Dawson told me that you were employed
here clearing the tank of the—er—carcases.”
No response.
“ Mr. Dawson has kindly allowed me the use of
his dining-room to hold a service of humiliation—
a prayer for rain, you understand—and I hope-
in fact, toe hope that every hand on the station
will attend.”
Then the old man looked at him and spoke—
Just one word : “ Listen.”
And they listened. And then fell upon their
ears an awful sound—the low, muffled moaning of
the great herds around them—dying of thirst.
“Parson ! there’s humiliation for yer—there’s a
fine meetin’ in a big dinin’ room, and they’ve been
at it these three months—humiliatin’ their bones
out o’ their bodies, and their eyes out o’ their ’eds
—down on their knees crawlin’ through the dust
to the tank, prayin’ all the way for water, and
chokin’ at last in mud—an’ I know ’em all—every
one. God Almighty ! what are yer givin’ us ? If
’a won’t ’ear them, do you think ’e ’ill 'ear such
a as you ? ”
Two minutes later, the stockman was slouching
off to the tank with his block-and-tackle, grinning
to himself at the little cloud of dust rapidly
vanishing in the mirage.

At Xmas time every one indulges in a little
wine, ami if the wine is good he is a very ardent teeto-
taller who would object. But even the most ardent pro-
hibitionist’s voice is silenced if he finds it is the Boar’s
Head Brand of pure Australian wines that is being used,
as tbe fine qualities of these wines disarm all criticism.
Every patriotic Australian should smoke
an Australian-wood, Australian-made pipe. Taylor Bros.,
of 248 Pitt-street, Sydney, whose advt. appears on page
4, have made a borm in Australian-wood pipes. Their
leading line is their already famous aromatic Needlewood
pipe, which possesses all the best qualities of briar and
meerschaum combined —coolness, sweetness, dryness,
self-absorbency. Needlewood, of which Taylor Bros, are
always buyers, is indigenous to Australia, and is a beauti-
fully-grained wood. It is difficult to season, and Taylor
Bros, are working from a stock which has been kept for
years. Taylor Bros, will make up pipes from wood sent
by constituents, and will (as per advt.) mail a
single pipe by post to any part of the world on receipt of
remittance. Send a Taylor Needlewood to your friend in
England as a typically Australian present.
The total fire-losses paid to date by the City
Mutual Fire InsuranceOo. (95 Pitt street, Sydney), exceed
£107,000. The City Mutual was started in 1877, and for
the first five years met with reverses. In ’B3, Mr. Robert
Kec/r, the present president of the Insurance Institute of
N.S. Wales, undertook the conduct of affairs and has
remained managi r ever since. Under his guidance the
City Mutual has achieved steady and continued progress.
During the Kerr decade the amount paid for losses has
been £65,000, while the dividends and bonuses have
amounted to £21,000. The reserve-fund is £9OOO. This
is good work to achieve within 10 years, in addition to
wiping ou' a deficit of about £3OOO, which stood as a had
mark to Ihe ’B3 record. The City Mutual is noted for
prompt and equitable settlement of just claims. It is a
purely Australian institution, the majority of its share-
holders reside in country districts, and all its funds are
invested in N.S. Wales. The Chairman of Directors is
John See, M.P., N.S.W. Col. Treasurer.

Most Useful Ointment in the World

PREMIER OINTMENT in the SOUTHERN
HEMISPHERE. But, as many new arrivals
have lately made New South Wales their home, it
may be as well to let them know that there is such
an article as JOSEPHSON’S OINTMENT purely
theproductionof thecolony, composed of wild plants
indigenous to the country and nowhere else, the
principal of which is the EUCALYPTUS, now
so famed thoroughout the world.
WHO SHOULD SUPPER PROM PILES,
when one application will relieve you?
Read this letter and Try for Yourselves
Messrs. E. Row and Co.
Dear Sirs, —I have tried your Josephson’s Oint-
ment for Piles, and have found much relief from
using it. You are at liberty to use this if you feel
disposed.

Row’s Assorted Bitters
CONTAIN
Row’s Dandelion Bitters.
We recommend these BITTERS to be taken
two or three times a day; a wineglassful for an
adult, smaller quantity for children.
Por General Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism,
and Cutaneous Affections.
The action of dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, is more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than any other medicinal
plant known.
Persons suffering from Skin diseases will find
these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the quantity twice a day.
They Purify the Blood and Liver.
See what a Medical Gentleman says
about them.
Messrs. B. Row and Co.
With thanks for forwarding me a bottle of your
Row’s Dandelion Bitters, and consider them most
excellent, and superior to many others that I have
previously tried. Yours faithfully, HENRY
CHARLES CURTIS, M.R.C.S., England.

Baron Berzilius’=
Buchu Bitters.
BARON BERZILIUS’ REPORT.
They are chiefly given in complaints of the Urinary
Organs, such as Gravel, Chronic Catarrh, morbid Irrita-
tion of the Bladder and Urethra, Diseases of the Prostrate
Glands, and Retention or Inconvenience of Urine, from
the loss of tone in the parts concerned in its evacuation.
These Bitters I also recommend in Dyspepsia, in Chroiiio
Rheumatism and Cutaneous affections. The action of
Buchu on the human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of the Kidneys and Bladder than any other herbal
plant; and it also assists persons suffering from Skin
Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and
Inducing perspiration.
Row’s Steane’s Bitters.
STUDY HEALTH BY TAKING ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS.
The great demand throughout the colony for
these pure Bitters shows they are superior to all
others and equalled by none.
Facts Speak Louder than Words.
Read this sworn testimony from a well-known
citizen:—
Statutory Declaration.
11 1> George Hewett, do hereby solemnly and
sincerely declare as follows:
“ lhat I feel it a duty I owe to the public to
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS a day in a little water, and
I hope others suffering from the same complaint
will be as speedily cured.
“ (Signed) G. HEWETT,
i j uiMumjL— “ 215 Pitt-street.
Row’s You’ll Do BittersT
All who suffer from Chest Complaints, Cold, Coughs,
and, general weakness of the Lungs, will gain more ease
and comfort from a wineglass of ROW’S YOU’LL DO
BITTERS than any cough medicine tried before.
Read what Medical men say about them—
BJERKIN, M.D.The Bitter is pure, and not like
others in overdoses. It has a remarkable influence on the
liver, promoting the secretions of Bile, and correcting it
when deranged, and restores healthy evacuations in oases
of habitual costiveness.
D. EOKSTROM, M.D.—BBBB—I find these Bitters a
most valuable and wholesome tonic, being pure and
strengthening; a stimulant to the liver, assisting diges-
tion. 1 therefore thus recommend them.
G. B. WOOD, M.D.—lt is the purest of Bitters, and
exerts a peculiar influence over the liver.
Row’s Pepsine Bitters.
All who suffer from Weak Digestion will soon
be cured by these Bitters, taken three times a day
before meals. J
Row’s Oriental Bitters.
A Splendid General Tonic, with a tumbler of
water makes a drink equal to any best Champagne.
Row’s Steane’s Wine
!s a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and'
take depresslon of s P irits cannot do better than*
ROW’S STEANE’P WINE,
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all!
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this,
when suffering from general debility. It’s onlv a
pure tonic. Try it. J
Teetotallers will find this newly-inventedi
f ns . w f r Purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drmk. As an anti-febrile is unsur-
kS r, °f:T Wben l ou . call for these as k foi

The respoctlva values of dailies and
weeklies as advertising mediums is being discussed as a
rasult of the rapid decline of the weekly editions of
dailies. Once upon a time, in the halcyon days of Cobb’s
c )aches, people in the country were content to receive
t!i- ir news weekly j but the railways and the telegraph
have altered all that. The country resident is no longer
satisfied with a weekly paper containing a great mass of
matter cribbed from some daily journal printed at the
same office. He has mostly read the daily paper and is
as disgusted with having it re-served to him under
another name as a man would be who was offered hash at
a first-class hotel. If he takes a weekly paper, he wants
to get one like The Bulletin, original and readable from
cover to cover. There can be no doubt that the doom of
these weekly editions of daily papers is sealed. People
d m't give a rap for ponderous collections of stale
news pitchforked out of the daily editions, and jumbled
up with some “agricultural notes” about how to kill
vermin on cabbages. They have ceased to read these weekly
editions. Only the advertisers, attracted and deluded by
the enormous circulation usually claimed, have remained
faithful. Even they are beginning to find “no results,"
and are dropping out.

Ths writing of the Caligraph can always be recognised
by its peculiar evenness and regularity of impression ;
this is due to its being the only typewriter which writes
on a flat surface.
The Electric Telegraph Department of N.S. Wales, after
testing every machine in the market, has just given the
Agent for the Caligraph the largest order ever given in
Australia in one line for Typewriters.
There are now 120 Caligraphs in the Government
Departments of N.S. Wales. There are more Caligraphs
in the public offices of Australia than machines of all
other makes combined.
The Caligraph will manifold 20 copies at one operation
by interleaving carbon, and when used in conjunction
with Edison’s Mimeograph will produce 1500 copies from
one stencil, each equal to the best original work. Send
for Mimeograph circular.

that would be poisonous if taken internally and in suit)
cient quantities. This is not true of my SKIN TONIC,
which contains no such ingredients. 1 freely admit that
for certain stubborn skin diseases, like all successful
physicians and skin doctors, I do recommend stronger and
more effective preparations, some of which contain ingre-
dients which, if taken internally and in large quantities,
would be injurious and perhaps poisonous; hut when
applied externally and in small quantities, as directed,
they are never injurious, but always beneficial. With
the exception of my Dyspepsia Cure, which is purely
vegetable and consequently harmless, all my pre-
parations are for external use only, and where directions
are followed, it is absolutely impossible for any injurious
results to follow. It is well-known that many of the besl
patent medicines and doctors’ prescriptions, for both
external and internal use, contain poisonous ingredients
in small quantities; but it does not in any way foil w
that these medicines are injurious. On the contrary,
they are usually beneficial when properly used. Ask any
respectable doctor or chemist if this is not the case. 1
give free consultations, and sell most of my preparations
direct to the customer, and for this reason I somelim s
antagonise doctors and chemists, as well as my pro
fessional competitors; but any fair-minded doclm,
chemist, or skin specialist will tell you that every
word 1 have said is absolutely true. Several prominent
London physicians, who have In come better acquainted
with me and my methods, have for some time sent their
“ incurable ” cases to me and I have cured th m. MY
CELEBRATED SKIN TONIC contains absolutely Tie
poisonous or injurious ingredient; is entirely harmless,
and always gives satisfaction. It has for years had tic
largest sale throughout the world of any skin lotion, a> d
is conceded to be the best and oidv satisfactory prep.mi-
tion for permanently and harmlessly cleansing the ski
and removing blemishes. After devoting my life to tin-
study and treatment of the skin, I would indeed befoolis
to advertise and sell, at great expense, any thing but th
very best of remedies ; and especially anything that could
by any possibility be injurious. People who know me
also know that any preparation made or recommend) d In
me for the skin can be used with entire safety and benefit.

Professor TODD, Anderson’s College Medical

It is a lighter, clearer, and more ethereal oil than any
I have hitherto used, besides being free from the heavy
nauseous odour characteristic of others.
This is particularly noticeable when the oil is sprayed
into the throat.
It is very palatable when taken internally, wdiich places
it above other preparations, and considerably enhances its
value.

The New Melbourne Building
OF THE
Equitable Life Assurance Society
of the United States.
About three years ago the Equitable Life Assur-
ance Society of the United States purchased a
very valuable block of land in Melbourne, at the
corner of Collins and Elizabeth Streets, and upon
this site they have now erected a most magnifi-
cent and conspicuous building, only to be equalled
by the Society’s new Sydney building.
The external walls are constructed of solid
granite blocks obtained from local quarries, and
the design is entirely in keeping with the material
employed. There is no frittering away of archi-
tectural skill on excessive ornamentation, bub a
most artistic effect has been produced by skilful
adaptation of the best features of the Romanesque
style of architecture to the requirements of modern
life, and the result is a design of great grandeur
combined with simplicity which gives an appear-
ance of permanence and solidity to the building
in keeping with the motto of the Society ; “ Not
for a day but for all time.”
This symmetrical and massive structure rises
majestically above its surroundings and is well
worthy of the site it occupies, which is the best in
Melbourne, and there it will stand for ages an
ever-present witness of the enterprise and good
faith of the gigantic institution that built it.
Some of our readers will, no doubt, remember that
Mr. E. W. Scott, who has recently been promoted
to the important position of foreign vice-president
of the Equitable, when he established branches of
the society in Australia, about 10 years ago, pro-
mised that if the society was well supported by
the Australian public he would erect both in
Sydney and Melbourne offices better than any
that had been built in Australia by any other life
insurance company. This promise has now been
more than fulfilled by his purchasing the best
sites and erecting the finest offices in the two lead-
ing cities at a cost of nearly three-quarters of a
million sterling. These two magnificent buildings
are without doubt the finest that have been erected
south of the Equator by any private institution,
and each is not only a beautiful and permanent
ornament to the city in which it stands, but they
both give a solid and enduring guarantee of the
stability of the Equitable which its Australian
policy-holders can always see with their own eyes
and touch with their own hands.
Mr. Scott is now on a visit to Australia
for the purpose of still further improving the local
organisation of the Society and liberalising its
methods. The Equitable has always been fore-
most in studying the interests of its policy-holders,
and their trust in the Society has strengthened
and extended that public confidence which it
deservedly enjoys wherever it is known.
To return to the Melbourne building: there could
not have been a more handsome material than the
granite which has been chosen for the fronts of
the structure, and the shading of the colours is
very harmonious. The darker polished Phillip
Island granite first, then the two courses of the
base of the building in polished Harcourt grey
granite, and after that for the next three floors
Harcourt granite, with picked faces, and above
that to the top the same material with axed faces.
The splendid quality of this material and its
beautiful colour must strike every observer, and
it certainly comes up in every respect to the
coloured granite imported from Aberdeen, Scot-
land.
The Equitable has, in the erection of its build-
ings in Australia, pursued its general policy of
encouraging and developing local industries wher.
ever possible, and thereby in this case giving em-
ployment to hundreds of colonial workmen at a
time when it is most sorely needed.
Great care has been bestowed upon the execu-
tion of the work. The foundations, which are of
Portland cement mixed by machinery, were
started at a considerable depth below the footpath,
on a solid bed of clay.
One of the chief features of the building is the
colossal arch in the Collins-street front, which has
a height of 60ft. from the pavement to the key-
stone, with a span of about 44ft. The huge stones
of the arch are not set in cement, but the joints
are tilled with lead, and it required about ten tons
of this metal to complete the work of the arch.
The arch carries Corinthian columns of about 4fb.
diameter, withaheight of 41ft., going through three
storeys. Above this will be another storey, the
frieze of the building, finishing with the main
cornice, that projects over G^ft. — an immense pro-
jection, but quite in proportion to the height of
the building, which is about 138 feet above the
level of the street.
Another notable feature of the building is the
portico under the arch in front of the main I
entrance, with lonic columns and pedestal and
entablature in red polished granite. This plat-
form is crowned by a 13ft. high bronze statue,
modelled by Professor Tilgner, a noted Viennese
sculptor, and cast in the Imperial Austrian Art
Foundry.
On either side of the portico on the ground floor
are stairs leading to two banking chambers of
grand proportions. The vestibule, behind the main
entrance, leading to the staircase hall, will be
richly decorated with marble carvings, Corinthian
columns, and pilasters with bronze caps, the
entablature and ceiling to be treated with the
same materials.
Inside the staircase hall are two spacious eleva-
tors. The richly-ornamented enclosures and cars of
the elevators are entirely built of steel and
wrought iron; no wood whatever is employed.
Surrounding the elevators are broad marble stairs
with wrought-iron supporters. Wainscoting, land-
ings and halls are also to be covered with marble ;
all the floors throughout have steel beams sup-
ported by steel columns. These columns are
entirely enclosed with terra-cotta lumber so as to
protect them against fire, and the spaces between
the beams are filled in with the same material,
which is very strong and perfectly fireproof. The
flooring is of hardwood in short pieces solidly
embedded in the terra-cotta filling, so that no
hollow spaces for vermin or for the spread of fire
exist.
Terra-cotta lumber has not hitherto been used
in Australia, and the enterprise of the Equitable
has resulted in the starting of a new industry both
in Sydney and Melbourne. The material is pro-
duced by burning a mixture of clay and sawdust,
which can be moulded into any shape ; the result
is an extremely light, indestructible, and abso-
lutely fireproof material. The doors and windows
will be of colonial hardwood. All the rooms will
have good ventilation, also gas and electric light,
and a steel safe. The lavatories will be of the
very best English make, with the latest improve-
ments.
The offices of the Society are to be on the first
floor, the principal office fronting Elizabeth-street
being a lofty hall going through two storeys. All
the other rooms are intended for rental purposes.
In all, the building has seven storeys, a basement-,
and sub-cellar, and its dimensions are 133 ft. on
Collins-street, and 80ft. on Elizabeth-street, and
it is 138 ft. high. It is as fireproof as modern
science and experience can possibly make it.
The building was designed by and erected unde r
the supervision of Mr. E. E. Raht, the chief
architect of the Society, who was sent out to Aus-
tralia by the Society for the purpose. The mag-
nificent offices of the Society in Vienna, Berlin,
and Madrid were designed by the same eminent
architect, and so was the beautiful and majestic
structure now being erected for the Society in
Sydney. These numerous buildings are a proof
of the world-wide business of the Society, and of
the extraordinary growth of its business through-
out the civilised world.
In times such as these, when so many financial
institutions have been either shaken to their base
or utterly destroyed, and when so many idols in
the business world have been shattered, the public
will no doubt recognise the value of the protection
afforded by a policy issued by such a company
as the Equitable, which cannot be affected by
local panics or local mishaps of other kinds.
The rapid progress of the Equitable is, as far : s
we know, quite without parallel amongst Life
Assurance companies. It was organised in 1850
and now it is one of the wonders of the Financial
World. Consider for one moment that early in
1859 it had nothing, at December 31, 1892, the
date of its last Annual Report, its assets amounted
to nearly thirty-two millions (£31,887,510), and
that during its existence of thirty-three years ?t
has paid to its Policyholders over thirty-six-and-a-
half millions sterling in hard cash. Such success
is not the result of chance; but of the energy, skill
and care of those who have conducted its affairs.
The founders of the Society were men having a
thorough knowledge of Life Insurance, and they
determined, in the first place, that the Society
should be a Mutual Company, that is, its affairs
should be conducted solely for the benefit of the
policyholders, and that every penny of surplus
earned should bo for their exclusive protec-
tion and benefit, and another object was
that of reforming Life Insurance business.
The aim of the Society has been throughout to
manage its affairs with wise economy and on a
common-sense basis ; and, faithful to the charter,
to study the wants of the policyholders, and offer
them the forms of assurance which will in the
long run suit them best. It was the originator of
the clause making the assurance incontestable at
the end of three years. It adopted the system by
which it is now able to pay every policy imme-
diately it matures with the same promptness and
regularity as bank drafts are honoured. It
devised the tontine method of collecting and dis-
tributing dividends, which has made its policies
so popular that the majority of its competitors
have adopted (under one or another name) the
same system.
The Equitable’s Tontine system supplies the
public demands because it gives all the protection
furnished by other kinds of Life Assurance, and
in addition it gives large cash returns to those
policyholders whose lives are prolonged, and who
then need money for their own support rather
than assurance for their families.
The Society has been admirably conducted
since its establishment, and judging by the
enormous amount of new business transacted by
the Equitable for many years it has thoroughly
succeeded in interesting the public in its Life
Insurance reforms, and of maintaining that interest
to an extraordinary degree. By the exercise of
strict economy the management has year by year
laid up a Surplus Fund for the protection of the
Policyholders which now amounts to nearly six-
and-a-half millions sterling, a surplus very much
larger than that of any other Life Company in
the world —and which enables the Society to
guarantee its policyholders the greatest safety
coupled with the largest Bonus Results.
The head office of the society is in New York,
but the Australian branch is practically a colonial
institution. When establishing its Australian
business the Equitable availed itself of local
talent. The Society’s actuary for Australasia,
Mr. Godfrey Knight, is a native of Australia, and
had, before joining the Equitable, distinguished
himself in his long connection with the Govern-
ment Insurance Department of New Zealand,
which was made a success, mainly, if not solely,
by his ability and energy. The managers of the
various Australasian branches of the Equitable
are all men who have served their apprenticeship
and won their spurs in Australasia. In the
Equitable the managers are usually elected from
agents who have distinguished themselves in the
field, therefore in its service, as in that of Napo-
leon, every soldier carries a field-marshal's baton
in his knapsack.
The business of the Society in Australasia is so
organised that the policy-holders lose none of the
practical advantages of dealing with local offices.
The Australian directors of the Society deal with
all matters concerning its business in Australia,
and issue policies and pay claims without reference
to New York. At the same time the Australian
policy-holders of the Equitable have the advan-
tage of insuring in a company which cannot be
affected by local epidemics, or local mishaps of
other kinds, by reason of its business being spread
throughout the civilised world.
