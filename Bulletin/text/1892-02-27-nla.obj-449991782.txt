DR. KELLY’S REPUTATION IS SO THOROUGHLY ESTABLISHED THAT IT WILL
ONLY BE NECESSARY FOR HIM TO INTIMATE THAT HE IS PRACTISING AS A
SPECIALIST TO BE APPRECIATED AS A BENEFACTOR TO SUFFERING MANKIND. AS
THE GREATER PORTION OF THE NEW SOUTH WALES PUBLIC IS AWARE, DR. KELLY
IS A LEGALLY QUALIFIED AND REGISTERED PHYSICIAN, AND HAS BY FAR THE
LARGEST PRACTICE IN THE COLONIES, MANY PERSONS AT A DISTANCE, HOWEVER,
ARE UNAWARE OP HIS GREAT SUCCESS, AS, HITHERTO, HE HAS REFRAINED PROM
ADVERTISING. HENCE, TO WIDEN THE SPHERE OP HIS USEFULNESS, HE HAS
DETERMINED, BY MEANS OP ADVERTISING, TO MAKE HIMSELF KNOWN IN REMOTE
DISTRICTS WHERE HIS REPUTATION MAY NOT YET HAVE TRAVELLED. AS THE
QUESTION MAY ARISE, WHY DOES SO EMINENT A PHYSICIAN AS DR. KELLY FIND
IT NECESSARY TO ADVERTISE, HE MAY REPLY TO ONE AND ALL AS FOLLOWS
IF THERE IS A PERSON ON EARTH TO BE PITIED IT IS HE WHO IS OBLIGED
TO ASSOCIATE WITH HIS FELLOW BEINGS WHILE HIS MIND IS CONSTANTLY
HARASSED AND TORTURED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OP
WHAT MUST INEVITABLY FOLLOW.
HE LOOKS HAGGARD AND SHEEPISH. HE IS NERVOUS IN PUBLIC, AND EXTREMELY
GIRLISH AND BACKWARD IN LADIES’ SOCIETY. THE VICTIM OF THIS, THE MOST
DANGEROUS OP ALL VICES, IP NOT RELIEVED, SOON REACHES A STATE WHICH MUST
END IN LIFE-LONG MISERY. HE MUST ULTIMATELY SINK TO THE LOWEST STAGE
OP DEGRADATION AND SHAME. DR. KELLY MAINTAINS THAT THE PHYSICIAN WHO
HAS THE POWER TO CURE, AND REMAINS SILENT, IS GUILTY OP AN UNPARDONABLE
SIN OP OMISSION. PERSONS WHO READ HIS GREAT WORK ON THIS SUBJECT WILL
BE SHOWN THE INEVITABLE RESULT OP THE BAD HABITS, AND IN MOST
INSTANCES SUFFICIENTLY EARLY IN LIFE TO ENABLE THEM
TO SEE THEIR FOLLY
BEFORE ANY DISEASE HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OP THEM. THE BOOK WILL ALSO
SHOW THEM CLEARLY
HOW TO CURE THE DISEASE WITHOUT
THE ASSISTANCE OF PHYSICIAN OR CHEMIST.
MANY PERSONS WONDER WHY THEIR MEMORY IS NOT SO RETENTIVE, AND THEIR
GENERAL INTELLECT NOT SO CLEAR AND STRONG AS THEY FORMERLY WERE.
DR. KELLY’S BOOK WILL EXPLAIN THE CAUSE IN PLAIN AND SIMPLE LANGUAGE.
THEREFORE, EVEN THOUGH YOU BE FREE FROM DISEASE, SEND FOR THIS GREAT
MEDICAL WORK, THAT YOU MAY BE ENABLED TO ADVISE OTHERS AFTER PERUSING
ITS PAGES. VERY FREQUENTLY THIS MAY BE DONE BEFORE ANY GREAT HARM
HAS TAKEN PLACE.

AMONG WHICH ARE

MANNER IS ECCENTRIC, LISTLESS, SHY AND EASILY CONFUSED,
HIS MOVEMENTS ARE SHUFFLING AND UNCERTAIN, AND
BETRAY A MIND ILL AT EASE, HIS MENTAL OPERATIONS ARE
ERRATIC, HE IS EMBARRASSED, AWKWARD, AND ACTS WITHOUT
ANY FIXED PURPOSE, HE IS ABSENT-MINDED, AND GIVEN TO
REVERIE AND DESPONDENCY.

An Incurable Constitution.
True to its inherited instincts and the spirit
of its allotments and its bank-balance, the
Legislative Council of New South Wales has
rejected the measure for the abolition of
plural voting, and the great democratic
scheme has got back practically to the point
at which it started. There was a large—a
wonderfully large—gathering of the vene-
rable nominees to assert the privileges of
Property on this occasion, and out of 59
members who either voted or paired on the
second reading, only 27 could be found to
support the cause of progress, leaving the
moneybag element in a majority of five.
Most of the 27, too, only supported the
second reading with a view to abolishing
the One-man-one-vote principle in Com-
mittee ; at least twenty of them had drivelled
off and on for months about the necessity of
granting a special vote for “ Thrift”— which,
under the circumstances, practically meant
“Theft”—and the democratic element in
the Upper House of New South Wales may
be estimated as consisting of seven members,
five of whom are doubtful, and gone either
in the head or the knees. With such a
Legislature the future prospects of the
democratic programme are exceedingly un-
certain, and yet, by the insane muddlement
of the New South Wales Constitution, it is
practically master of the situation. There
is no lawful or constitutional mode of over-
riding its decision. It may possibly be scared
into submission, seeing that it is very old
and senile and toothless ; but the country
has no available weapon to employ against
it, and can only treat it after the manner of
the Chinaman who bangs his empty drum to
frighten away devils—if the devil sees fit to
stay in spite of the drum then there is
nothing more to be said. New South Wales
sold its soul in the days gone by to the 70
potentates of the Upper House ; it is
weighed down by a bald and spectacled
nightmare, and if that Upper House chooses
to remain firm there is no remedy for it
short of insurrection or homicide. In this
respect the province does not stand alone ;
Aqstralasia is burdened with several more
Chambers of the same kind, all equally
useless, bull-headed, and impracticable ;
and therefore the situation is an interesting
one. The Councils of Victoria, New South
Wales, Queensland, and Maoriland have all
systematically blocked progressive legisla-
tion, and in ail these provinces ominous
threats have arisen over and over again that
the Upper House must either be mended or
ended. So far, however, nobody has dis-
covered any method of carrying out the
threat. Premier Dibbs now proposes, as
many other Premiers have done, to start a
war against the nominees who stand in the
road, and he will probably find that the con-
tract is a large one.
* *
The first proceeding on the Government
programme is to call a new session of Parlia-
ment, to pass the One-man-one-vote Bill
again through the Assembly, and to present
it once more to the stagnant old obstruc-
tionists who block the way. There is no
probability that these obstructionists will be
any less old or any less stagnant then than
they are now, but it is necessary to allow
them an opportunity of reconsidering the
position. When they have rejected the
measure a second time, a wild, sad cry
will go up to Heaven from the Foreign-trade
press demanding an immediate dissolution
and an appeal to the country. The Council,
for want of a better excuse, professes to
object to the scheme “because the people
have not been consulted,” and therefore the
Foreign-trade papers will call for a general
election by way of consulting the people and
letting “ the traitor ” Parkes have another
chance to get into office. The Council’s
alleged reason, however, as both it and the
shoddy editors are well aware, is lying—it
would really be a lie to use any other word—
pure and unadulterated. The last general
election was fought on this question above
all others, and every single member of the
Lower House, whether Foreign-trade, Pro-
tectionist, Labour, Independent, or non-
descript, was returned to support the
principle of manhood suffrage without any
reservation whatever. And not only that,
but among the defeated candidates only one,
ex-Treasurer Burns, ventured to declare
himself a supporter of the present system ;
and despite the powerful support of Parkes,
and the fact that he stood in a district where
he had spent the country’s money like water
under circumstances the memory of which is
still green, and likely to remain so, Burns
was defeated ignominiously. Never since it
first existed has New South Wales been
so unanimous on any subject, and if
the Council and the Foreign-trade press
are not content with the result, and still
assert that the country “has not been
consulted,” the only answer is that the
country cannot possibly be consulted any
more or any harder than it already has been.
The nation returned a whole Assembly all
pledged to this issue in the most uncom-
promising terms, and if forty general elec-
tions were held in one year, it could do
nothing more definite than that—unless,
indeed, it hanged a Legislative Councillor on
a lamp-post as an expression of opinion.
» # #
Under these conditions there are only
three possible alternatives. One is to flood
the Upper House with a sufficient num-
ber of new men to make a democratic
majority ; another, to utterly abolish
that gathering of cracked emperors as a
curse and a hopeless‘anomaly ; and the
third, as already mentioned, to trade on the
age and the imbecility of the House of
Patriarchs, and by some means or other to
scare the inmates of that asylum into sub-
mission. The latter device, however, is
open to one serious objection—there is no
reason why the patriarchs should scare
unless they wish to. The nation is not
likely to rush their premises with clubs and
nooses and bricks, and so long as it abstains
from such extreme measures, the Upper
House can block the way with absolute
impunity till it dies of old age. Therefore,
there remain practically only two devices to
choose from—both unpromising,
* # *
To turn the Council into a democratic
body, or one sufficiently democratic to be
reasonably in touch with the sentiment of
the country, it would be necessary to send
to that Chamber a contingent of, at least,
fifty new members. The division on the
Electoral Reform Bill proved the Council to
consist at present of thirty-two utterly
incurable bigots, one dead member, about
eight legislators who are too blind and bed-
ridden to attend, and twenty-seven alleged
Liberals, at least twenty of whom want “a
vote for Thrift ” and have all the other signs
of rampant Toryism—the name only ex-
cepted. It would take, therefore, fully
fifty new members to create anything even
distantly resembling a democratic majority,
and the Government which proposed such
wholesale wreckage of the Constitution
would be promptly blocked by the Governor
or the Queen, both of whom are as irremove-
able and irresponsible and as Tory as the
Upper House itself. But even granting that
the nominations could be made, which is
practically impossible except by violence,
the difficulty would only be removed a step
further. The average democrat deteriorates
fast in the atmosphere of the Council,
an I three months’ experience would pro-
bably convert at least two-thirds of the new
members into advanced Conservatives. No
man can be trusted with irresponsible power,
and no democrat ever has remained, or ever
will remain, a democrat when placed in a
position of authority from which nothing
short of death can remove him. The
number of liberal-minded men who have
been sent to the Upper Houses is legion ;
the number whose liberalism has survived
their elevation for any great length of time
could be counted on one finger. Therefore
if the Dibbs Government sent fifty reliable-
looking Liberals to the Council at the pre-
sent crisis, it is quite probable that, by the
time the Electoral Reform Bill again reached
that institution, so many of them would
have fallen awav from their faith as to
leave the Conservative majority almost as
strong as it is to-day. Moreover, the ex-
pedient is only a temporary one at the best.
It would raise the Upper House to 120 mem-
bers, and by the time the Land Nationalisa-
tion Bill came on at some period of the
future the spirit of Property would have so
permeated the entire body that it would
require 120 more nominees to swamp the
previous contingent; and at every change of
policy or public feeling the process would
have to be repeated ad infinitum. Thus in
course of time there would be 20,000 poli-
ticians in the Council—a prospect which is
too dreadful to contemplate,
# * #
The entire abolition of the nominee House
is, undoubtedly, the logical remedy for those
perpetually recurring difficulties, but un-
happily the nominee House cannot be legally
removed unless it abolishes itself, which it
is by no means likely to do as at present
constituted. No doubt, if fifty or sixty new
members were created for the sole purpose
of passing a Bill for the extinction of the
present system, and the nominee Governor
would sanction the creation of these mem-
bers, and the irremovable and irresponsible
British monarch would permit him to do so,
and the new members would all adhere to
their pledges when they were placed in a
position where they could break these pledarcs
with complete impunity, and the Governor
did not veto the Bill when it was passed,
and the Queen did not withhold her
consent, the required result might one
day be arrived at, but among all these
dangers the prospects of ultimate success
are limited. The nominee Council, the
nominee Governor, and the irresponsible
British sovereign are three obstructions
which cannot be removed by any lawful or
constitutional means; when the country finds
that it is necessary for its progress that it
should get rid of them, the only thing it is
legally empowered to do is to ask them to
commit suicide, which will assuredly prove
an unprofitable request. The representative
system in, at least, five out of the seven
provinces of Australasia is a lamentable
farce. Of the four influences which make
up the governing power of the country, one
—the Assembly—-is under the control of the
nation ; another—-the Council—can some-
times be bounced into submission and some-
times not ; while the Governor, in a really
serious case, can have his salary stopped,
and, should that fail to move him, can be shot
at or hooted or have his windows broken ;
and the monarch cannot be reached at all
and can only be made the target of strong
language in the newspapers. Meanwhile,
among all these obstacles the nation
scrambles along in a crab-like fashion
and trusts to Providence. Hitherto it has
dealt chiefly with small reforms, and some-
times it has howled down the Upper House,
and sometimes it has come to a dead-lock
with the Governor, and on other occasions it
has even remonstrated with the Crown, some-
tunes with success and frequently without it.
Now, however, it has a matter on hand
which may rouse the Conservative elements
of the State to active resistance, and if the
three irresponsible sections of the Govern-
inent should resolve to stand firm there
is absolutely no remedy save revolu-
tion. The one fatal defect about almost
all political systems is that they
contain no efficient legal provision for
their own abolition when the country has
got tired of them. They are all based on
the assumption that they will last for ever,
and yet each one has to be shifted in course
of time to make way for something new.
Then, if the original constitution-makers
have chained the State down too tightly,
something must be damaged when the old
institutions come to be torn up. The
superstition about the necessity for a “stable
form of Government” is responsible for
innumerable evils ; the trouble with most
Governments is that they are altogether too
stable. That of New South Wales is a case
in point ; it has been made secure by the
simple process of piling dead weight upon it,
after the fashion of pig-iron on a safety-
valve, and the more pig-iron, the worse will
be the explosion in the end.
The Civil Servant and the State.
Early in the beginning of the month, New
South .Wales Legislator M ‘Court moved that
Civil servants and all men employed under
Government should be paid their salaries every
14 days, instead of monthly as at present.
Thereupon Premier Dibbs and Lawyer Crick
felt called upon to make remarks derogatory to
the dignity of the Public Service, and injurious
to the character of the men whose experience,
attainments and administrative abilities have
hitherto somewhat safeguarded the community
from the consequences of Ministerial blundering
and legislative ineptitude. Mr. Crick sup-
posed that Civil servants would not object to
being paid two months’ salary for one month’s
work. As Mr. Crick —in common with every
other member of the New South Wales Legisla-
tive Assembly—is now a paid Civil servant, at
a salary of £3OO a year, we presume this to be
a personal explanation. He further remarked
that the life of a Minister must be becoming a
torture to him by reason of the number of
applications for employment in the Civil Service
" billy 50 per cent, of the population being
engaged in efforts to obtain Government billets.
We are interested to know whether Mr. Crick
includes in this estimate those of the community
desirous of entering the Government service as
members of the New South Wales Parliament,
for even the Minister whose fate is so feelingly
commiserated is a Civil servant—and frequently
an incompetent one that. Mr. Dibbs stated
that he had ten applications for Govern
billets in one day, and Minister Lyne de 9 nt
that he had an average of 50 p'er diem °
Crick advocated making the Civil Seiv- r ‘
unattractive that few would be anxious to * C ° S °
it, “ and live without soiling their hands ”° nter
* * #
Evidently the average member of Parliam
is thoroughly ignorant of what a Civil S( L. ent
should be, or of the nature of the work 1
obliged to perform. The Civil servant « 18
earn his living “without soiling his hand' »
but we fail to see any reproach in this if t
earns it efficiently by the exercise of his hr,; 16
Mr. Crick, as a lawyer and a paid legist
also earns his living “ without soiling i ’
hands,” but he would not on that acco US
refuse a legal fee, or remit to the p-.-m? 1
Treasury the £3OO per annum which his counV
pays him to occupy a seat in the Legist.,: ''’
Assembly Chamber, in fact, the whole mießtffi P
is obscured and muddled by misconception ’mi
the service is itself degraded by
patronage. The fact alone that Ministers hive
the power of making appointments to the Put];
Service is an evil. The whole administration
of the departments should be placed under tli
control of a commission, and no appointment
whatever should be made save from the rank
of persons who had satisfied the requirements
of a severe examination. As evidence of the
ludicrous light in which members of Parliament
ate all too prone to regard the Civil Service of
the country wc would refer to the report of the
debate in the New South Wales Parliament i n
committee of supply in review of the estimates
on February 17, when Queanbeyan O’Sullivan
morbidly anxious to reap a cheap notoriety bv
raising a cry for retrenchment, took occasion to
waste a deal of eloquence on the subject of the
salary of the chief Under-Secretary, Mr
Critchett Walker. Two years ago the
annual remuneration of this gentleman
was £960, which sum was subsequently
raised to £llOO, and Mr. E. w.
O’Sullivan was, in his newly-born enthusiasm
for retrenchment, desirous of having the
amount reduced to the old figure. It never
struck the “ keystone of the democratic arch ”
that not only Mr. Critchett Walker, but
every other under-secretary, is really and truly
the permanent minister of the department he
administers, and that, from any practical point
of view, or any point of view whatever having
regard to the interests of the community, it
would be far wiser and safer to reduce the
salaries of those designated Ministers in the
ostensible government of the country.
* * #
Mr. O’Sullivan hates the word “socialism”
worse than an Orangeman hates holy-water,
and, apparently, any approach to it by the
State enrages him to the utmost. Now, the
Civil Service is the thin end of the wedge of
State-socialism, and with the gradual growth
of the Service, and its absorption of various
industries and associations, now promoted by
private enterprise, beneath Government control,
the ideals of economists like Louis Blanc will
gradually be brought about. But this cannot
be done by making it a reproach and a by-word
to be a servant of the State. And it is inter-
esting to note that in defending Mr. Critchett
Walker against the attacks of the O’Quean-
beyan, Mr. Dibbs forgot his sarcastic references
to the Civil Service of a week before. On the
contrary, he paid a fine compliment to one
who had faithfully and ably served the country
for 34 years, who had climbed from grade to
grade until he had obtained the blue-ribbon
of the service, and whose whole time
was practically at the disposal of the
State, whose Ministers he had to edu-
cate and assist in the discharge of their
functions. The Premier made a capital hit in
reply to a question of some honourable donkey’s
as to why, if Mr. Critchett Walker were
overworked, two men were not employed to
fulfil his duties. Mr. Dibbs characterised the
remark as nonsense. The Principal Under-
secretary was entrusted with the most sacred
secrets of the Government, and received the
entire confidence of whatever party was in
power. The most delicate matters of State
passed through his office, and it was impos-
sible to divide such responsibility between two
officers. Mr. Dibbs might have added that it
would be just as reasonable to conduct the
Government of the country with two Premiers,
or two Ministers, or for two Ckmmidnders-in-
Chief to lead an army to victory. Regarding
the matter from a purely commercial stand-
point, the Principal Under-Secretary is under-
paid, rather than-over-paid. The sum of £llOO
per annum is not a great salary if we consider
the prizes offered in the professions, in,trade,
and in finance. The Principal Under-Secretary
is as much a specialist as*a doctor, or a lawyer,
or a clergyman, and it is a recognised principle
in political economy that the services of the
specialist, if wanted, must be paid for.
* # *
The Civil Service of any country, instead of
being rendered unattractive, as Mr. Crick sug-
gests, should be made the most alluring of
any service in that country. The State
should employ the best men. To achieve
this the Civil Service must be honoured
and honourable. The prizes offered must be
worth the getting. The salaries paid must
be over rather than under the ruling rates. Mr.
Dibbs and Mr. Lyne complained that they were
pestered by applicants for Government billets.
Cut down salaries and they would be pestered
still more ; the worst men and , the least com-
petent would crowd into the different depart-
ments, for the most capable would prefer
competing for the prizes of life in the open
market. As a matter of principle the State
should strive to become the ideal employer,
should endeavour to set an example to all out-
side employers whatever. But the State can
never occupy this enviable position while billets
remain in the gift of party, while the poli-
tician’s letter of recommendation is accepted as
a charter of competence. Every civil servant
should be compelled to pass a r
tion, and receive his appointment direct from a
commission responsible to no political clique.
How is it possible to maintain a high standard
in the public service while politicians are over-
crowding the offices with relatives and Hangers-
on whose only recommendation, in nine cases


. , is their total unfitness for any walk
out 0t life ? If the Civil Service is corrupt,

trulv valuable man is generally the officer who
has accumulated his experience through a long
nrse of years, and whose knowledge of the
inurements of his department has become a
riortion of his being. At all events the degra-
S, t j oll of the Public Service is in the main
attributable to the “ spoils ” system, and the
1 a bit each successive Government has acquired
r re quiting political services to themselves at
the expense of the nation. No good can, bow-
er be achieved by belittling the dignity of the
bile servant, or by the Government entering
into competition with outside institutions for
the best labour at the lowest wage : and the
sincerity of the Parliamentary apostle of
retrenchment will ever be in question who does
not include his own salary in a proposal for
” o rata reduction. Had Mr. E. W. O’Sulli-
van suggested an all-round pruning down of 10
or 15 cent., instead of taking specialised
cases his earnestness for reform might not have
been called in question, nor his position at the
present moment so supremely unenviable and
contemptibly ludicrous.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Samuel Griffith, Nigger-Driver.
The week before last Premier Griffith, of
Queensland, announced his conversion to the
black labour and nigger-driving interest, and
solemnly retracted the eloquence of a life-time
about the necessity for preserving Australia for
the Australians. Last week he rashly gave his
reasons for thus swallowing his alleged prin-
ciples. A deputation interviewed him at Rock-
hampton to protest against the raising of a new
nigger difficulty and the resumption of the
blood-stained slave-trade in Polynesia, and the
result shows that no politician of Griffith’s
calibre should ever explain anything, for when
he does so the results are disastrous
The Premier said that lie had formed his opinions with
the greatest reluctance and entirely owing to the way he
had been treated by those.for whom lie had laboured for
years. When everything he did was denounced by the
working class, it was his duty to consider the whole com-
munity. The deputation specially asked that the exten-
sion of the term for the employment of Kanakas should
not be granted without the country being first consulted,
but the Premier declined to give any assurance on that
point, or to disclose the intentions cf the Government.
Sir Samuel said he was certain from personal observation
that sugar could best be grown by small farmers, though
admittedly in some cases with the assistance of black
labour.
Nobody ever made a more fatal explanation
than this. Griffith admits that he lias become
an advocate of nigger-labour “entirely owing
to the way be lias been treated by those for
whom he has laboured for years.” In other
words, the democratic party in Queensland
isn’t sufficiently grateful to Griffith, and be
introduces the Kanaka by way of a fiendish
vengeance on the men who have found him out t
If the working classes bad worshipped Griffith
with sufficient abjedtness, he wouldn’t have
introduced the Kanaka. Therefore, there
remain just two alternatives : either the
nigger is necessary for the country’s pros-
perity, arid yet Griffith would have let
the country’s prosperity go to wreck so
long as the working men of the southern
districts lioorayed for him and voted for him,
and let off fireworks in lus honour—in other
words, he would have sold the nation for a
banner and a bonfire ; or else the nigger is a
curse and Griffith is deliberately bringing in
that curse and invoking ruin on the land in
order to make his small soul feel better, and to
get level with tire followers who have abandoned
him. Furthermore, he states that “ when
everything he did was denounced by the work-
ing classes it was his duty to consider the
whole community,” which surely means that if
the working classes hadn’t denounced him, but
had grovelled before him instead, lie wouldn't
have considered the whole community ; he would
only have considered the grovellers. Griffith
laid his whole miserable policy hare in one act to
that Rockhampton deputation ; lus one and
only political motive is a devouring vanity, and
to gratify it he would sacrifice his country,
his money, his friends, his principles, and his
prospects of heaven, if he has any. His career
has been one miserable scramble after notoriety
from first to last, and he doesn’t even know
how to scramble effectively. He never did
anything for the masses except to blow off
loud-mouthed sentiments and platitudes, and
now he goes back upon them because they are
not sufficiently thankful for the platitudes.
He wrote revolutionary essays in the Boom-
erang ; and he introduced an Eight-hour Bill
“of a permissive character,” which provided
that everybody ought to work only eight hours,
but if he had "to work sixteen it was a lament-
able circumstance, and the Government
couldn’t help it ; and he invented the Italian
cheap-labour scheme ; and he helped to flood
the country with the scum of the English work-
houses and gaols, imported at the expense of
the oppressed tax-payer; and he established the
most extraordinary system on record of faking
the electoral rolls in the interests of Property.
And now we are given to understand that
because the working men of Queensland are not
sufficiently grateful for these things, Griffith
has re-established the infamous Polynesian
slave-trade in these last days of his moral
decadence. Yet, despite all these things, Sir
Samuel’s socialistic sentiments are as fresh as
ever. There is no visible connection between
his statements and his actions; he is a Jew at
night and a hog in the morning, but he never
mixes the characters. It has long been a ques-
tion in Queensland which is the real Griffith
—the one who snutiles over the poor, or the one
that grovels to the rich ? Now it is beginning
to be apparent that one of them is no more real
than the other ; they are both transient and
bogus ; there is no genuine Griffith at all—
only two shadows, and Samuel will go back on
one shadow as soon as the other when his
vanity is concerned.
Tlie Murdered Kanaka.
Recent advices from Queensland cast a new
and still more unfavourable light on Premier
Griffith’s coloured labour policy. When that
apostate democrat proposed to introduce the
Italian, with Ids stiletto and his strange
assorted diseases and his dirt and his vast and
wonderful ignorance, he drew a moving picture
of the ruin and utter desolation that overspread
the North, and which could only be alleviated
by the wholesale importation of cheap labourers.
When, later on, he proposed the re-introduction
of the once-abhorred Kanaka he grew still more
pathetic about the deserted mills and the
abandoned fields and the towns that were fall-
ing into ruins, and almost shed tears over the
slime and the alligators and the pestilence of
tropical Australia. The one reason why the
Kanaka was to be re-established as a permanent
curse in the tropics was that the white man
could not work, but could only die, among
these awful surroundings, while the Polynesian
flourished and was happy in the sweltering
mud-banks and the swamps. And now,
strangely enough, it is emphasised that the
Kanaka—that ideal toiler of the tropics—dies
off just about three times as fast on the sugar-
plantations as does the white workman
similarly employed. The ancient story about his
capacity for flourishing in a malarious land and
under a blazing sun is lying pure and unadul-
terated. His fitness for the work consists
simply in the fact that he dies peaceably and
no one makes a row over his remains—we have
known 80 to die right away of dysentery within
a month on one plantation —and he can’t write
to the papei’S or appeal to the law because he
knows no English, and he doesn’t go on strike
to any extent, and he can be driven to work
even when he is dying, and when he is dead he
can be buried anywhere, and his decease
attracts so little attention that the local editor
will sit over his grave and write articles about
the way the happy Kanaka prospers and grows
fat in the canefields, and never realise the
awful incongruousness of the situation. The
islander’s only qualification for his gladsome
billet is that he is cheap and helpless, and the
oft-repeated assertion that he is employed
because Nature has evidently built him for the
job is utter, irredeemable perjury—he is the
one man above all others, as evidenced by the
hard logic of statistics, that Nature didn’t build
for any such purpose. And further, the same
statistics demolish in one act the dreary picture of
the utter ruin and disaster that are alleged to
have overtaken the sugar industry of Queensland.
The output of sugar in that province is in-
creasing every year, and the yield for the last
12 months is the largest on record. The disaster
that is always being foretold has never come,
and there is no sign of it coming. A few
planters who bought their properties at boom
prices have suffered heavily since the borrowed
money is gone, and the boom is over, and the
swamps have gone down once more to their old
valuation, but" the sugar industry itself is no
more responsible for the falling of land-values
on the Herbert River than it is for a similar
fall beside the Yarra. The whole theory of
nigger-labour is based on two atrocious false-
hoods. There is less need for the Kanaka than
ever there was, and at all times his employment
has been thinly-disguised murder —neither more
nor less.
——
The Tall of Australia.
Tiie official Libei’al organ, the London Daily
News — apropos of Australia’s want of enthu-
siasm over Booth’s army of diseased criminals,
rowdies, sweated blacklegs and hysterical
fanatics —thus composes the epitaph of Aus-
tralia, and prints “ Ichabod ” in large letters
over the gates of this continent: —
If Australia refuses to allow the admission of emigrants,
her brief record of progress will be practically closed.
This statement is a wonderful sample of the
arrogance of Bull —that inflated fat man whose
stomach overshadows the whole earth. Aus-
tralia, by the News’ theory, cannot progress or
form a nation except by means of British immi-
grants. It can grow its own population in the
course of years, and it can gather in Germans,
Yankees, Scandinavians, Russians, and other
sturdy elements, and absorb them to increase
its numbers and win “ tugs-of-war,” but unless
it takes the human refuse of the London slums,
its “record” will close up. The waste, igno-
rant and diseased humanity which England
wants to get rid of at any price, is still so
much better than any material that can be
locally grown that it is this country’s only hope.
Should this be true it occurs to us that Aus-
tralia might possibly do a lot better without
any hope at all. If the “ brief record of pro-
gress ” must shut up unless helped along by
Booth’s paupers then it had better shut. Aus-
tralia has progressed pretty well in the past
without Booth ; if it can’t get along without
him in the future then it will perish respectably
and be buried decently under the wattle. There
are some kinds of prosperity that are too
horrible to think of, and the kind Daily
News alludes to is one of them. Jo be a
rich man with a Salvation drum always banging
before your window, and a haggard, spindle-
shanked dwarf always trying to sell you a
War Cry, and a pallid female in burst boots
always appealing to you to drop a penny in the
tambourine, and with an eternal red-shirted
procession headed by an apostle with a red nose
always tramping —Tramping —tramping down
the street is not a prospect worth living for. The
“ record of progress ” call close if it wants to —
we aren’t particular. This is a country where

Uve on rabbit and native bear in comparative
comfort, and the coming ruin of the Australian
nation really doesn’t matter.
Ik Premier Hums wishes to be a benefactor to
his country, let him pass an enactment pro-
viding that every British and other foreign
lunatic, criminal, or diseased person introduced
into New South Wales shall be promptly sent
back to the country from which he came, at the
expense of the shipping company which fetched
him. At the present time there are 3659
officially - recognised lunatics in New South
Wales, and no less than 2014 of these are
imported cranks from Great Britain, while only
1121 were born in the province. The native-
born population is nearly three times as great
as that of British origin, therefore, Britain
supplies something more than five times
its fair average of lunatics. If the im-
ported Englishman could be utterly abol-
ished, New South Wales upon these
figures would, have a smaller proportion of
insane than any civilised country on earth,
barring Austria, Portugal, and Spain. All the
other great provinces of Australasia have now
closed their doors against the horde of madmen
whom Britain sends out here and turns loose in
order that they may be a burden on any
country save her own, but in New South Wales
any kind of howling idiot can find free
admittance. British cranks who are stopped
at other points are therefore sent on to
Sydney, sometimes to be shifted straight
into an asylum, at other times to marry
and rear deranged families, and ultimately
beat their wives' brains out With the poker
or the flat-iron, and thus supply refresh-
ing “copy” for the evening papers, which
report the gory deed in three columns of
blood-gurgle and massacre. This sort of thing
is growing stale. New South Wales dislikes
the British lunatic, and dislikes still more the
British globe-trotter who comes out here and
inspects that lunatic, and then goes home to
state that the Australians are evidently a
degraded race, whose brains have been under-
mined by drink and all manner of horrors.

There is something thrilling and dramatic in
the Moss time-payment furniture episode which
is being gradually unrolled in Melbourne. The
story of Mrs. Moss’s time-payment furniture
began away back in 1882. In that disastrous
year she took a house in Fitzroy, and obtained
furniture from one Rosenthal on credit to the
amount of £1545. She paid a considerable sum,
apparently about £lOOO, on account of this
property, the amounts paid being described
as “ rent.” Then Rosenthal went insolvent,
and when he was gone his trustee promptly
seized Mrs. Moss’s sticks and sold them oft.
Why he did this is not explained, but
as the sticks only realised £159 75., or
one-tenth of the purchase-money, it would
seem as if the collapsed Rosenthal had taken
a considerable “rise” out of his customer.
Presently, however, the burst furniture-man’s
wife took up his business, and let Mrs. Moss a
house at £2 10s. a week. She also sold her
£4OO worth more furniture. Then the rent of
the house was raised to £4 10s., and shortly
afterwards it went up again to £6. Mrs. Moss
paid the £6 a week, and also paid for the bed-
steads and other things, but when the whole
£4OO tv as liquidated, she was floored by a
demand for £ll9 more, and on top of this came
another demand for £413, being the balance
due on the first lot of goods which the miserable
Moss had already paid so much for and lost.
At this stage the latter lady assigned her estate,
being willing to sacrifice the second lot of tables
and chairs, "provided the eternal bill was only
wiped out for good and all, but the Rosenthal
started ejectment proceedings, and Mrs. Moss pre-
sently knocked underand signed a new agreement
for £605 for more furniture. Meanwhile that
distracted person had got into further trouble
with a money-lender who lent her £l7O in 1887,
presumably ” to pay Rosenthal with, and
received back £1963 in interest, and who still
wants £515, mostly for “ goods delivered.”
The goods consisted of still another batch of
time-payment furniture —in fact, Moss seems to
have been a sort of sepulchre for furniture, and
the bill is made up chiefly of such items as
“window curtain, £l2 10s.;” “ umbrella, £4
145.;” “parasol, £3 10s.;” “pair of candle-
sticks, £l2 10s.” and the like. These are a
few of the items which the official assignee has
dug out of Mrs. Moss’s accounts up to date,
and he is still making good progress, and find-
ing more furniture almost daily.

The calm determination with which James
Munro has stuck to his self-appointment and
closed his ears to the bowlings of impotent
indignation, is intensely human under the cir-
cumstances. With political extinction near at
hand and his financial fame already gone for
ever there was nothing left for James but to
clear off to England with the last gift the gods
had given him—the gift of the \ ictorian Agent-
Generalship. In the hour of his distress the
played-out Premier found £3500 a year, and a
safe retreat from the execrations of unfortu-
nate shareholders, shoved into his grasp by the
beneficent hand of Providence, and his bony
fingers closed upon the good thing, as a matter
of °course. It was his last chance. The
country, he was well aware, would curse and
swear in a feeble, aimless fashion, even as it
had snorted and jeered when Graham
Berry, six years ago, seized the same billet,
after having taken the precaution to effect an
increase in the salary attaching to it. But as,
for all practical purposes, James was himself
the country and the premier representative of
public opinion, nothing could be more certain
than that the rest of the populace made no
difference in the matter. He was lawfully
entitled to select a new Agent-General, and his
choice fell upon himself. It is quite true, as
the single-minded and patriotic Sir Berry
remarked, last week, that the country ought to
“ elevate high principle as the greatest political
requirement from any party, ” but it is equally true
that James Munro hadn’t been elevated on that
understanding. Victoria took J. Munro for
what he was worth, assuming him to be worth
a little more for the moment than his prede-
cessor, Gillies. And now that he is acting
strictly up to his reputation, and in perfect
harmony with his record, by doing the best he
can for himself, the disgust of his compatriot;)
is much more unnatural than the conduct which
called it forth.. Munro, indeed, is merely
meeting the requirements of a political party.
Which the party is himself.

The Victorian Purification of Rolls Act is a
useful Tory engine for disfranchising numerous
common residential electors, and is being
enthusiastically utilised accordingly. Any
voter who moves from one district to another
even though he may only cross a street to
become located in a new electorate —becomes
the legal victim of the lynx, who forthwith
lodges an objection against the appearance of
his name on the roll of the district vacated,
while, under the old Act of ’9O, the defrauded
elector cannot vote in his now district until he
has resided within its bounds for three months.
After this fashion, over COO names were recently
objected to at the Fitzroy Revision Court, and,
as most of the men so challenged failed to
appear, nearly all those names were struck off
the Fitzroy roll. The monopolist knows his
vantage-ground. Many workmen cannot afford
to lose a day’s work to attend a revision court.
Others never receive the notices of the objec-
tions lodged against them, for these are held to
be legally served if delivered at the vacated
addresses described on the old rolls. Thus the
fat capitalist puts a little of his surplus cash
into the hands ot jackal agents and wipes out
his political foes with the jawbones of his
hirelings.
It is getting to be more and more probable that
there will he something very like civil war in
Queensland at next general election. By that
time the “ faking ” of the electoral-lists will be
finished, and hardly one name will he left on
the rolls, from Stanthorpe right up to the Gulf,
that isn’t the name of a monopolist or a mono-
polist’s flunkey. Then the Labour-party must
either submit to have no influence in the
election, or else it mutt take out ils share
of the rights of man by heaving bricks. And if
it does, the “military” will be called out,
and the editor of the Brisbane Worker will
be put in gaol (this item of the programme
is a dead certainty in any case), and
every fatted capitalist and his minion will he
sworn in as special constables to go about seek-
ing whom they may devour. The special con-
stable is a mean tyrant at all times and under
all circumstances, and with the Coalition to
urge him on he will be a roaring fiend. W lien
a crowd of his species were sworn in dv ring the
Melbourne strike—even under the retjime of the
fat and gentle Gillies, who always wore a
pleasant snigger on his shining red visage, and
wanted to please everybody, and had no more
ferocity in him than a feather-bed —they per-
formed tricks which were calculated to make
the angels weep. One day a harmless insurance
canvasser called on one of them while he w r as in
the full flush of his new-born dignity, and
the “ special ” promptly rushed out with his
staff of office, and arrested the visitor on a
charge of “ knocking at my door.” Then he
deposited his prisoner in the cellar to await his
trial. Later on he cooled down a little and
resolved to release him. But the humorous
captive declined to go unless legally discharged
by a magistrate, and the two men fought
desperately all over the place till at last the
“special ” managed to get his hardened criminal
out into the street. The rest of the amateur
force mostly went round and stunned people
promiscuously with their batons—barring*one
who chastised his wife with his insignia of
office. That is how the special constable con-
ducted himself even under the control of the
lazy, fat, old Gillies, who meant well, in a
fluffy sort of way, towards everybody. Under
the Queensland Coalition he would be simply a
pestilence, and when he had ramped round for
a few days somebody would start a full-blown
insurrection to get rid of him.
Writes a “ Sucking Alligator ”
Dear Bulletin,— You have so frequently advocated the
imposition of an increased probate-duty that I would like
to explain how easily even the present comparatively
light tax is evaded. Five per cent, seems a small enough
duty upon an estate exceeding £50,000 in value, but to
the Midas who purposes dividing his acres among his
children and whose paternal affection exceeds his
patriotism it is altogether too much. Instead, therefore,
ot devising to each son his respective share by will and so
charging the estate with the duty, he simply transfers
the land by deed of gift, deferring this operation perhaps
till advancing years warn him of the approach of A/.rael.
This, of course, means that the State gets a mere £1 out
of the estate (as stamp duty on the deed) instead of per-
haps some thousands. With any increase of the prohate-
duty this practice would no doubt become general in
large estates and could not easily be checked. Again, it
is quite a common thing for a man on his death-bed lo
transfer all his property to his wife, or any other person,
and as the transfer is an absolute one and not a donatio
mortis causa no duly is payable, but the usual £1 stamp
on a deed containing no, or a nominal, consideration. I
may say that numerous cases of both natures are within
my own knowledge. Max Nordau's simplicity as to the
practicability of enforcing a huge death-duty is somewhat
amusing ! — Yours, A Sucking Alligator.
This is all right so far as it goes. But the
habit formed during long years of greedy
acquisitiveness, in hundreds of cases, leads to
the rich man sticking to his goods and chattels
even at the very last gasp —dying with them
firmly in his clutches. Then that’s where the
State comes in. A big probate-duty can do no
possible harm. It will often rake a substantial
sum into the State coffers, and if it brings about
an earlier division of wealth, why, all the
better.
The efficacy of the strychnine injection in
cases of snakebite was farther demonstrated
recently when a patient badly bitten near Cainp-
belltown (Tas.) by a whip-snake was successfully
treated. Very little alcohol and ammonia were
administered.
The Tasmanian fruit-crop this season is
the largest ever known in the island—so large as
concerns the “ small fruit ” as to cause a ruinous
glut. The apple-crop is equally big, but a ready
outlet for this will be found in the London market.
Tasmanian orchardists—especially in the Huon
district—are faced with an enemy even more
destructive than the dreaded “ Codlin moth.”
The new pest is called the “Black Spot” and is
a fungus-like growth which when it attacks an
apple renders it unfit even for pigs. A scientific
country parson of considerable experience in
such matters has been subsidised by the Tas-
manian Government to give his whole attention
to this visitation for a period of 12 months in the
endeavour to discover a remedy.

the place; it is certainly the largest and best-

BJC Macquarie-street North, Sydney, Feb. 24, 1892,
My Dear Moorabinua,—
There is snappy “f rooking” in “The Solicitor” at the
Criterion, and Emma Bronton (who has dyed her hair a
lovely golden, or else it was a very unwiggy wig) easily
bore away the bell. Her first dress was pale-grey cash-
mere looped over a dress skirt of grey brocade, fronts of
the brocade embroidered in gold bullion ; hat with grey
feathers atop. Her second garment was cream insertion
mull over primrose and trimmed with yellow ribbons;
hat of primrose and cream feathers. Marie Fraser wore
sulphur-green silk and black lace in the first act, with
three-cornered hat trimmed with pink flowers, and a
white gown bound about with blue ribbons in the last
confusing shriek—but the comedy was so funny that the
ladies would have got there all the same if they had been
dressed in sugar-bagging. On the night I enjoyed the
show the circle was quite full, and the prettiest dress was
(fortunately) on the prettiest girl—pink chiffon trimmed
with ruby jewelled galon, and a cluster of pink roses in
her hair.
Talking about the “Criterion,” reminds me that a fair
and uncorseted star who used to stride there, and who
posed as a profound believer in all sorts of uncanny
advanced ideas, but who bossed a very prosaic old man
and a small baby allee same, turned up her nose on a
recent occasion at the society women of Australia to a
bystander, who tells me all about it. “They have not
opened up the thoughtful side of life at all . . . and
when they find out the meaning of life, they will be all
the better for it,” she said, loftily, and she ought to know,
for, according to one {now) hears, the lady “had been
to school—rather,” as Pattie B. used to sing, and Society,
which cuddled her at first, dropped her like a hot potato
when they found out how much she could teach ’em, if
she chose. But it’s very ungrateful of her to snick at our
“ society ” women. They tried so hard to look owlish and
have “ideas,” while she was endeavouring to turn into
gospel the notions of that giddy old Swedish baldhead
that verily they should have their reward. “ Nobody goes
to Australia to make fame,” she concluded, “ they go to
make money.” And it must feel like a wicked waste of
time when they don’t make either—as was the experience
of jhe genius in question—mustn’t it ?
I lately received a weeping epistle in three pages and a
“ tiger,” as one may say, from a frozen-out governess who
heaps a lady-like malediction on all public schools to
which well-to-do parents, who don’t attach much import-
ance to social environment, send their olive-branches to
pick up crumbs of learning at the rate of a few coppers
per week. The consequence is that private schools suffer
pupil-hunger, and governesses are a drug on the market.
It is the expanded curriculum at the “Nash ” that works
the mischief: the pupils are taught all the accomplish-
ments for so many extra coppers—French, I believe, is
drilled into them for 2d. per week, and the schools are
filled with children for whom surely they were not in-
tended, and the little ragamuffins are crowded out like
the private teachers.
As for the poorer children who are pupils—the high-
flying subjects only serve to totally unfit them for the
positions which it is inevitable, in the course of life’s com-
petition, the great majority must ultimately occupy, and
as a result you have a hundred applications for a twenty-
shilling clerkship and two for a three times more remuh-
erative position as a skilled artisan. Ajiropos, I lately
heard of a little urchin who was sent to a hospital where
they coddled and cuddled him so that when he was sent
back to the parental hovel he howled to go back to the
hospital—turned up his nose at the simple joys of bare
boards and bread and treacle, and promises to be of
no earthly use to his relatives henceforth. Teaching the
piano to the washerwoman’s gal, who is born to cook, but
prefers to give “ lessons ” at a shilling a week, because it
is more “genteel,” has just the same effect. When a
girl is not a genius it is no real kindness to lift her above
the sphere where she is certain of getting employment
with a big chance of marrying some honest man who can
keep her, to the most hollow of callings in which even the
best educated people have to claw one another for a bare
living.
And how teachers of music have to claw one another
for a living!
Allured by the rumour that Gov. Jersey was going, I
patronised the tug-of-war one evening last week, but
“ George ”, didn’t appear, altho’ the inevitable fauteuils
and the unerring bouquet were all set out to do him
reverence. The elevated place of contest where puffy,
scraggy, sinewy, tall, andstuntedindividualshungdesper-
ately on a rope in a cloud of white chalk was, however,
haunted by lawyers—perhaps their idea was to be nice
and handy in case any of the teams wanted to bring
an action on the spot. The scene was novel, and conse-
quently interesting—from a distance. Close to, I am
told, the copious perspiration of the more or less untubbed
combatants set all the promenaders smoking in self-
defence. You couldn't blame them, but still the reek of
every sort of tobacco sent yours devotedly flying after an
hour of it. In conclusion, I must say that I don’t smile
on the tug.
I Zingaris and the Fleet met for cricket on Rushcutters
Bay Oval, the other day ; the seance was a great success
for those gyurls who dearly love a Merman in gold
buttons. One woman in putty colour tweed and a bunch
of tuberoses in her coat appeared well if wintrily turned
out until your eye roved to the hem of her garment. A
very sacred lady turned out in a splash-work print—black
ferns on a white ground—and brought her two nieces in
cream with black sashes. Miss Ethel Manning wore black
with a red striped skirt and red tie, sailor hat with a
scarlet band, and Miss Nellie Hill encored sage-green silk
with great success. Another interesting spectacle was to
see tne women catching their gowns on a tent-peg that
popped up right in the frequented pathway towards the
buns and lemonade. Of course they didn’t say anything
that I would have to insinuate by blanks when they were
brought up by the peg, but I’m sure when they heard
their gathers ripping they all said, “Drat it!” in their
heart of hearts.
It was a dreadfully hot day, but the play was fast and
furious. I never heard of a cricketer getting sunstruck,
did you ? although most only have a flannel cap between
them and a direct ray. Perhaps that’s one of the blessings
of being an athlete with a thick skull—or is it that no one
gets sunstruck while he perspires? But revenons a nos
moutons —the teams ought to have run their flannels
through the steam laundry before posing on the wicket.
One officer especially—but he may have bought them
for cloudy white, and the colour has only kept fast in
patches. The band played, of course.
The second day’s cricket—All England v. New 7 South
Wales—w 7 as rather listlessly watched by the “ gallery,” on
account of the hopeless-looking score the enemy ran up—
but there was a bee-swarm attendance. The members’
portion of the ground looked something like a Quakers’
meeting—all the men in the members’ stand and all the
women in the little pavilion over the way. Lissome Marie
Fraser w 7 as there in an art costume of pink silk w 7 ith coral
pattern in white, and one of her stage hats to top off
with ; Miss Simpson wore a white silk gown with mauve
band; Miss Calvert’s gold straw bonnet trimmed with
pink and blue was becoming. A pale-grey gow 7 n mingled
with silver brocade was lit up by a yellow chiffon scarf
very effectively. The prettiest girl w 7 as dressed in pink
shrimp courduroy with zouaves of gold braid, flat hat
smothered in pink roses. Miss Dight had a well-fitting
gown of mushroom woollen trimmed with ecru silk, the
sleeves covered with cream guipure; her black hat
trimmed with peas-blossoms; and the only observable
heiress in the gathering w'ore a green silk frock and a
“Hamlet ” hat.
Apropos of the cricket-match—how quickly some women
are to fancy themselves insulted! “Big figures!”
innocently remarked a man waving his hand at the score
beyond, where the total stood at four hundred odd. But
just as he spoke, two of those expanded bolster ladies who
w T addle at every gathering happened to be passing.
“ Imperence!” said the one indignantly to the other.
“ Brute !” said the other indignantly to the one. That
was all.
A scintillating circle graced “ Trovatore ” at the Royal
last Saturday, and the frocking was fast and furious.
Mayor and Mayoress Manning (the latter wearing a gown
of cobweb-grey tulle and brocade) brought a son and a
daughter (she in a pink silk and chiffon gown, if you want
to know). A doctor’s young wife, who is a belle just at
present, wore pink chiffon and jewelled galon ; a white
satin gown, trimmed with chiffon and cut steel, fortu-
nately had a seat in the front row ; and a stout maiden,
in black lace over yellow satin with an Empire bow-and-
ends pinned high on her brawny shoulders, was happily
placed in the back one. On the stage, Leonora had non-
committal clothing as usual, and pendulated between two
graceful gowns of white and black, but I really must pro-
test against the lady wearing a white petticoat with her
black gown in the last act—it made her resemble a willic-
wagtail. Azuoena (and I must again rise wearily to sub-
mit that she oughtn’t to have left off the walnut-juice
when she came to her chin, leaving a white throat under-
neath—it looked as if she hadn’t washed her face) got all
the vegetables that were unchained for the occasion, though
all the singers deserved them—only Manrico shouldn’t
have turned and bolted up stage when he finished his
martial solo in the third act. It looked as if he expected
a brick.
But what amused me was to see the people devouring
the score of a familiar opera like “ Trovatore,” of which
you can’t help knowing every semi-quaver. It was a
charming display of ignorance, but, bless you, they
thought it was giddy heights of dillettante-ism to care-
fully follow the score with one finger while "Ah ! che la
morte ” wafted on the breeze.
In the blazing hot Sydney summer, when men riot un-
availing in iced liquors, women—whose duty or pleasure
takes them townwards—have a far cheaper method of
getting cool. A fashionable frock-builder confided to me
recently that it was the custom of many of her clients
especially large and perspiring clients—who always have
to wear tight clothes—to pant up to the fitting-on rooms
where they take off their bodices and cool off in the
directest draught they can find. Then when they are
thoroughly ventilated they get back into their armour—
and go round to the old man’s office, I suppose, and snicker
at him for working in his shirt-sleeves.

Ashfleld was agog the other day over the wedding of
Miss Annie Leaf Wilson, of “ Symington,” Ashfleld, to
Mr.. “Rod.” M’Donnell, of Millie-Millie Station, near
Young, N.S.W. The golden-haired bride looked well in
a handsome wedding-garment of bengaline, brocade and
chiffon, and her gown was softened off with lace at five
guineas a yard. A bridal bouquet and diamond brooch
were the gifts of the bridegroom, and the bridesmaids
(three in number) wore cream silk. Quite a shower of
presents—including a buggy-and-pair from the happy
man, numerous cheques, and silver in galore—shed lustre
on the proceedings, and the honeymoon was spent at the
“ Carington,” Katoomba, Mrs. M’Donnell travelling
thither in navy-blue picked out with tan and trimmed
with blue braid; tan shoes and a sailor hat en suite.
The latest whispered story has to do with the scion o
a poetic pa and somebody’s husband, and the moral, if
there is any, seems to be “ never take too long a walk
when the old man stays behind.”
Everybody will sympathise with Mr. and Mrs. Burdekin
in the loss of their second daughter, Helen, who died in
London from the effects of influenza. Mr. and Mrs.
Burdekin, it is said, were returning to Sydney sooner
than they anticipated on account ot the English vvintey
being “ too severe for the children.” The words were
almost a prophecy.
A Bulletin correspondent sends me this vice-regal
anecdotelet. On the occasion of a cricket-match (Hill
View v. Mittagong)at Government House, Sutton Forest,
the other Saturday, the visitors were telegraphed to
“ come early,” so an 11 a.m. start was obediently mad 6
and the enemy reached Hill View at lunch-time, hunger-
ing and thirsting for victuals after their 12 miles’ drive.
After a foodless pause of an hour the vice-regal team, led
on by Gov. J., strode on to the field, cricket was at once
declared, and the visitors sadly took in their belts another
hole and tried not to look as if they had been hollowed
out inside. At five-thirty pale tea and pallid sandwiches
of the most ladylike cut made an inadequate appearance
and were swallowed whole by the Mittagong martyrs, but
the spell of a nine hours’ fast was not broken and part of
the meeting went away with a stitch in its loyalty, so to
speak.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.

Editor Bulletin— Sir,—An unveracious
correspondent has thought fit to describe, in the
columns of The Bulletin, my imaginary doings
at the MacKenzie-Balclutha banquet. Permit
me to embellish his fiction with a few facts. First,
I did not behave in the rowdy manner ascribed
to me; secondly, I was perfectly sober on the
occasion ; and. thirdly, I was not there at all.—
Yours truly, Vincent Fyke. Dunedin (M.L.),
Feb. 10, 1892. [Somehow all the good stories get
contradicted this way.—Ed. B.]
The Co-operative Irrigation Society, whose
advertisements appeared in The Bulletin a while
back, have obtained a promising lump of land at
Quantong, some 10 miles from Horsham (Vic.).
The sale of sub-divisions is already pretty lively,
and as both soil and climate are favourable to
fruit and vegetable production this new irrigation
colony should soon be started in active rivalry
with the older Chalfey country. Illustrated
pamphlets, plans, &e., may be obtained from the
secretary, at 42 Queen-street, Melbourne.
From Dorsetshire, (England) comes the
news of a farmer in that county being fined <£36
for starving his sheep to such an extent that 71
ewes and 500 lambs perished. Which brings to
mind the number of stations in Western N.S.W.
that are now heavily overstocked—with Egeson’s
postponed drought in the near perspective. If
Australian runholders are fined in proportion to
the penalty inflicted on their English brother, the
collateral assets of all our financial institutions
will not suffice to see them through the dry time.
Mr. “Jack” Want, Q.C., asserts re the
proposal to increase the pay of the N.S.W. police,
that six men could be got to take the place of
every man in the force at the present rate of
wages. The same can be said of the Colonial
Secretaryship or the Governorship, or any other
position. The Australian policeman is in point
of pay very small beer compared with the New
York officer. It is generally understood, by the
way, that the present policy of the authorities is,
as far as possible, to Select the force from natives
of Australia.
Andrew Fitzgerald, late manager of the
N.S.W. Trades and Labor Store, who got five
years last week for embezzlement, must be a
humorist, for between his committal and his con-
viction, he spent most of his time hunting up
discharged prisoners to ascertain “what solitary
confinement was like.” Another well-known
Sydney man very recently sent up for a long
“ stretch ” acted as if he did not mean, in Ameri-
can phrase, to “borrow trouble.” He arrayed
himself in purple and fine linen and “did the
Block.” “Hello!” cheerfully ejaculated a
prominent tradesman, seeing the soon - to-be -
jugged-one attired in a loud blue-grey suit and
aggressively new tan-boots with yellow sewing,
“ You arc a fool !” “ Why ?” enquired the law’s
prospective victim. “Well, you see, your rig is
all brand-new, and the fashions will have altered
a lot before you come put.” It is probable that he
was, at least, partially right. Blue-grey may be
de rigueur, but tan-boots will be as dead as hair-
nets at the end of a “ sixer.”

At Sydney Royal no less than three onem.
were presented during the past week, and two of
these were hrst productions in Sydney bv th
present company. “ Ernani ” was succeeded 1™
Donizetti s beautiful lyric of “ Lucia di Lammer
n l? or > , wlth an entirely new cast. This opera
afforded an opportunity for the introduction to !
Sydney audience of Signora Tancioni Cuttica «
light soprano with a voice of remarkable fresh
ness, purity, and culture, a lady, moreover who
sings with as little effort as a‘bird, and is nos
sessed of histrionic ability of a high order. He
reception was an ovation, and she was loudlv
applauded after every number. She is mi
doubtedly one of the finest and most accomplished
Lucias ” that have ever appeared in Australis
and her singing and characterisation of this rhk
will be remembered as among the local traditions
of Italian opera. It is interesting in this connec.
t lol i to note that Signora Cuttica made her debut
at Milan, about twelve years ago, in a small part
in Meyerbeer’s opera of “L’Etoile du Nord ’’ the
conductor on that interesting occasion being n n
other than Signor Eoberto Hazon, now of Sydney
The part of Edgardo in the present “ Lucia ” was
sung by Signor Cuttica, a painstaking artist
whose best effort was made in the closing scene
of the opera. Enrico, the baritone, was repre
sented by Signor Giannini Sisco, and Eaimondo
the basso, by Signor Coriolano lorio. Signor
Sisco has a rich and powerful voice, and his stage
presence is fine and dignified. The gems of the
opera were the ensemble at the close of the second
act, and the magnificent mad scene in the third
act, which was an absolute triumph of singing and
acting for the prima-donna. The management
would do well to revive “Lucia” before the con-
clusion of the season, for no other opera hitherto
produced has touched the same high-water mark.
* * *
On Saturday night “II Trovatore ” was
produced by the combined strength of the
Ernani and Eucia 3 casts at the itoyal before
a crowded house. This opera is always popular
and the airs are so provokingly familiar that
they ever suggest a reminiscence of the barrel-
organ of the prosaic side-walk. “II Trovatore ”
is, besides, irritatingly associated with a white
ostrich plume, nodding oyer the helmet of a tin-
cased nobleman of a Gothic type of architecture
and reviving boyhood’s recollections of the “ Castle
of Otranto” and the horrors of Monk Lewis.
There is also a lady in the show, whose propor-
tions are majestic, in love with a small tenor who
barely reaches her shoulder. Why is Leonora
always played by a big woman, and Man-
rico by a little man ? The heroine in ques-
tion was represented by Signorina Guidotti,
who achieved a genuine and well-deserved
success. This lady’s acting was as good as her
singing, and she was admirably supported by
Signor Yilalta, the tenor of the cast, who played
the part of Manrico with a vigour deserving of a
better fate than decapitation in the last act. The
gipsy, Azucena, was undertaken by Signorina
Cavalleri, who has sung in Sydney in the days of
yore, and who was literally overburdened with the
floral trophies with which her old friends pre-
sented her. She was, however, rather too light
for the part, and the first and second acts dragged
somewhat. In the third act, and especially in the
fourth, the performers warmed up to their work,
and the crowning tragedy of the final scene went
with a verve which seemed to satisfy everyone,
and make the assembled auditors feel glad that
they did not live in the ghastly days of a savage
like the Count di Luna. Signor Sisco undertook
this mail-clad effigy of slaughter, and it is not too
much to say that his singing held the first and
second acts together with an ability that caused
one to regret the sanguinary nature of the senti-
ments he clothed in sonorous song. On Tuesday
“Eigoletto ” was produced. “ Faust” is in pre-
paration, and in this masterpiece of Gounod’s the
combined strength of both casts will be employed.
It ought to prove the big success of the season.
* * * 5S
At Sydney Her Majesty’s, Gilbert Horatio
Parker’s special edition of the ancient fable of the
printer and the devil still waves its danger-signal
from the promp.-side flies. It is truly a wonderful
instance of literary atavism. Marlowe’s “ Doctor
Eaustus,” albeit stuffed with magnificent pas-
sages, but marred by vulgarisms and mediaeval
extravagances, was the model selected by Mr.
Parker in building up the present play, and he
has managed very ably to eliminate the poetry
and to retain the vulgarisms. A devil who is
always talking shop is not specially entertaining,
and although Mr. Geo. Rignold talks shop with a
great deal of unction and no small amount of
humour, he is not the sort of devil who would
succeed in business. He doesn’t coax, he bullies
people to the bad, and is as wearingly persistent in
recommending fire and brimstone, in their un-
adorned and crude condition, as an American
canvasser touting for subscribers for a bound
volume jewelled in four-and-twenty holes. Mr.
Jewett plays the part of Eanst with a commend-
able desire to do his best, but he is not the man
who would have conquered the love of a woman
like Marguerite as presented by Miss Kate
Bishop. This lady’s acting is a green oasis in a
desert of Gehenna, and redeems a wilderness of
crimson lime-light and demoniacal laughter from
unutterable woe. We shall be glad when Faust is
buried with his fathers and the long-promised
Shakespearian play is produced.

Mr, Brough, at Sydney Criterion, con-
tinues to drive a hansom, and Mr. Faberttomake
dubious bargains concerning diamonds which do
not belong to him. “ The Solicitor ”is proving
as big a draw as “Uncles and Aunts,” and at
present time of asking shows no indication of
falling off. It absolutely reeks with humour, and
is, as a literary production, leagues ahead of the
pieco it superseded. Of course, Mr. Brough has
most of the oleomargarine to himself—at least, he
shares it pretty evenly with the scenery and the
properties—still there is an amount of incidental
business of a provokingly paralysing description
which belongs to nobody in particular, but which
is taken up and laid down again by whomsoever
may impinge upon the scene. Miss Brenda
Gibson’s Mary Kingston and Miss Bronton’s Mrs.
Brandon are especially good performances, Mr.

At the Tug-of-war contest at Darlinghurst
Hall the different teams have been hauling their
W ay to fame, glory and prize-money, and excited
citizens of various nationalities have been cheering
and “barracking” in an infuriated manner for
the credit of their country. On the night that
Ireland put its hoof on the rope-walk, and pitted
the pratyof Brian Borru against the Caledonian
haggis, about 2000 sons of Erin foregathered on
the pavement outside, and grimly chewed the
shamrock of their wrongs. Luckily the Scotch
team went under at an early date, and Ireland’s
griefs were translated into victory. The descen-
dant of Erin-go-bragh is an uncanny customer in
a crowd, and he whoops in an awful manner when
things don’t go as Daniel O’Connell once repre-
sented that they ought to. The Italians made a
plucky and truly Roman stand, but weight and
a vegetarian diet were against them, and lager
beer gave the coup de grace with a gentle kind-
ness suggestive of the moral influences of the
triple-alliance. The crush at the doors between
intervals was a hideous scene of Dantesque dis-
order, in which women with children in arms
nearly furnished a tragedy. The tug-of-war
contest has, however, proved one thing—the only
people who ought to engage in it are those
accustomed to hang on to a rope, and in future
encounters of the kind only sailors should engage
—unless we make an exception in favour of the
hangman.
# * #
At the time of writing (Tuesday afternoon)
the only teams left in the contest are Sweden,
Russia, Ireland, Norway, and Germany. Sweden
is ahead with seven wins, Russia and Ireland
have six each, Norway has a score of five, and the
Fatherland brings up the tail of the show with
only four. Therefore, as the signs go, the best
hope of Ireland wauld seem to be that it may lick
Russia and get second prize, and the worst chance
is that Russia may lick Ireland, and then Norway
lick Russia, and Sweden wipe out Germany, in
which case, Sweden will be first, the Slavs second,
and the sons of the bogs will only have the plea-
sure of pulling off for the third prize, and if they
lose there will be a sad “ whirroo ” in Connaught,
and a dismal howl in the wilds of Connemara,
and their friends will rush in and knock the hall
to pieces, and kill everybody.

Now, La Cigale’s a saucy gal,
A rustic little lady, ah !
A singer rare who can’t abear
A life in calm Arcadia,
So goes to town and wins renown
And mashes Charley Ryley, O,
Which doth upset his former pet,
A duchess sweet and smiley O
(A married dame, who, tie for shame!
Is not at all a sainty bit);
But when that minx, her rival, sinks
To earth and has a fainty fit,
It works a cure—for, good and pure
As ’Vangelistio Varley, O,
The duchess turns and simply yearns
To give the maid her Charley O.
Of friends in need we love to read,
But such extreme civility
In womankind you seldom find
Amongst the old nobility.
And though, bedad ! we should be glad
To see them getting properer,
The human race can show no case
In which a like event takes place
Outside a comic opera.

“ La Cigale” is running on greased wheels
at Melbourne Princess’, and the fame of Marie
Halton spreads around like a fashionable epi-
demic. All that was evidently catchy on the
first night has caught, whilst the items that
didn’t “go” very freely have been forced upon
the market by strict attention to business. Elton
is putting up another good record, and the inci-
dental ladies’ orchestra fiddles with increased
effect. In short, people of accredited intelligence
protest that “La Cigale,” taken in the bulk, is
the finest show yet produced at the headquarters
of comic opera, and the force of protestation can
ho further go.

At the Bijou there was a necessary change
on Saturday night. “The Hobby Horse” wagged
his tail to rapidly diminishing audiences during
the week, so B. and B. wisely conducted that
attenuated animal off the track and turned him
out to grass. In the score of breeding, as they
observe in sporting papers, there is no fault to
hud with “The Hobby Horse,” but he has no
s peed, and he’s a difficult beast to manage, and
he can’t stay, and he isn’t worth entering for any
more engagements. In order to give an admiring
Melbourne a few final glimpses of George Anson
* n strong parts “ The Parvenu ” was revived on
Saturday for six nights only, but the admiring
offy showed its bad taste by stopping away con-
siderably from a really admirable performance.
Ch February 27th (if not earlier) the management
will revive “Caste,” also for six nights, and in
the saddened capacity of papa Eccles—a man who
once seen can never be forgotten—G.W.A. will
bid his friends adieu. He is off “home.” A
general election is about to happen over there,
(Hid Anson has decided to stand for Great Britain

The return of Dampier and Co. to the
Alexandra was received with a shriek of satisfac-
tion, but here again the house presented a general
appearance of having gone out to get a drink.
“ Valjean,” all the same, is a drama which earned
respect in the long ago, and will probably com-
mand fair support when the weather cools down.
The name is the only thing against it at a theatre
where Victor Hugo is not so favourably known as
Garnet Walch. “The Repentant Lag” would
sound a lot better.

The superiority of “Little Jack Sheppard’’
to every other Gaiety burlesque produced this
side of the line was easily asserted at the Royal.
The names of the librettist and of Meyer Lutz,
the composer, meet with no recognition on the
playbill, but it would be an act of courtesy to
pitch in a passing reference to the fact that their
work wasn’t blown together on the premises.
There is pretty music in “Little Jack,” also a
coherence of story and a liberal supply of humour.
“ Bluey ” and his commanding officer in crime
don’t meander out of the plot and reappear in
half-a-dozen idiotic capacities, nor does Jonathan
Wild forget that he is a villain with a purpose.
The show has method in its madness, and the
enduring quality of many melodies was proved by
the cheery reception given to them on Saturday.
In several places the present performance will
bear comparison with the old original success
under Brough and Boucicault. Royce is almost
as active as before, and Billee Barlow plays
the hero in a rollicking music-hall style which
suits the boys better than Fanny Robina or
Nellie Barren. They exchange confidences with
beautiful Billee between the verses, and when she
shows all her gleaming white teeth at one fell
swoop, they want to die rightaway and be danced
upon by the bouncing idol. Florence Harcourt,
as Thames Darrell, seems elegantly tame once
again, and the Mendez of Harry Daniels is another
tender reminder of the past. George Walton
makes a good Jonathan, whilst, in minor parts,
Edwin Kelly and Lilian Davies are many degrees
better than their predecessors. On the other hand,
thepresentMrs. Sheppard invites contumely, Edith
Vane is a hard, unsympathetic kind of Winifred,
and the wonderful dancing of departed Willie
Ward is sorely missed. In place of that famous
pas de deux by Ward and Emma Temple, at Blue-
skin’s “caffy ” the new Mr. Kneebone introduces
a quadrille-party whose results are more startling
than beautiful. The “ladies ” are members of the
tougher sex disguised in low neck dresses, and when
these bogus maidens begin to turn somersaults
across the stage the effect is very fin dc siecle.
However, the house was carried away by its feel-
ings and encored the novelty like one man. If
“Little Jack Sheppard ” is to run for the remain-
ing month of Billee B.’s engagement in Melbourne
the orchestra and chorus will have to be strength-
ened and polished up. Furthermore, there is
urgent need for better stage management and
stricter discipline at the Royal. Now, as in
“ Dick Whittington,” one is struck by the way in
which good material is not always utilised to the
best advantage.
At Melbourne Opera House they have
worked a large improvement in the programme,
cutting out some items that fizzled on the first
night and introducing a new juvenile trapeze act.
Undoubtedly, however, popular interest in this
high-toned variety show begins with Carl Hertz
and ends with the seven Graggs, who, in addition
to their own phenomenal turn, contribute all that
is worth seeing in a final ballet d action. Hertz
has a large reserve fund of tricks to draw upon,
and the Graggs are doing something which, if not
more wonderful, is more risky than any of their
first feats.

At Melbourne Athenaeum this week the
irrepressible Stanley, who has successfully ex-
plored Maoriland without leaving Srnythe to die
amongst the savages, is repeating his solemn
series of sermons on Darkest Africa and the pro-
per way to work it. The indomitable hero is sup-
ported by a fresh set of magic-lantern slides,
and if he could rig himself out with another voice
and a new batch of experiences, and a different
method of unfolding ’em, he might be earnestly
recommended as a warning to the young at
popular prices. As things are, he doesn’t go as
far as the Cycloramas in the entertainment line,
and the silk stocking company can run rings
round his dreary iron constitution. Frank Clark,
by the way, is showing a spicy assortment of the
aforesaid stockings at St. George’s Hall. Dan
Tracey has a nigger crowd at the Gaiety, and
other familiar places are sweltering in various
stages of prosperity, or otherwise.
At Poverty Point.
Marie Halton’s floral tributes (well earned) on the “La
Cigale ” premiere were mostly provided by the lawful
partner of her joys and sorrows, who, with painful anxiety,
watched the state of the poll from a stage box. It is not
eiven to every woman to enjoy the triumph of mashing
her own husband—after the honeymoon.
That well-esteemed little woman, the late Miss Dwight,
was for a quarter of a century pianiste at Melbourne
Temperance Hall concerts, and her friends thought it hard
that the regular Saturday night performance could not be
suspended while she lay dead. She was buried next day.
Someone must have a knife into the Sydney Tug-of-War
management, for the following “ad.'’ was the other night
sent along to an evening paper:—“Wanted, 100 Women
to scrub out Darlinghurst Hall immediately the tug-of-
war is over—ss. each—£2 tea-money. Begin B.SO a.ih.
till 4 p.m. —one hour for dinner. Five men in attendance
with water, brushes, cloths, sand, soap, etc.—afterwards
two (2) teams pull off, £lO-Colonel M, MacDonald,
judge.”
The dress-circle of Melbourne Princess’s held quite a
Gaiety Co. crush of no-forehead Johnnies on the first
night of “LaCigale.” “ Doocid fine tart 1 ” they said—
and her husband was in a stage-box, and the son is
nearly 16.
You can back the “popular favourite” to look after
herself when a new prima donna threatens to monopolise
public appreciation. It was downright rich to see the
little lady, when the company passed before the curtain,
receive piles of gorgeous vegetable, while the newly-
imported prima got nothing tangible. And, moreover,
the latter’s husband had to vacate a stage-box while the
said vegetable was hoisted up to the other by a menial!
J. C. Williamson has often observed (this, by the way,
is a new departure in the way of paragraphic introduc-
tion) that vanity alone keeps five-sixths of the purfesh
dragging out an impecunious existence upon the stage.
Evidently vanity doesn’t keep James Cassius on the
stage. He must be about the cleverest actor under the
sun who never wants to act if he can help it.
Cellier’s last mot. A few hours before his death hi B
copyist went round to see him and offered him sympathy-
Cellier thanked him warmly, adding: “But I’m nocup to

quite unfit for publication 1”
Dear Bulletin,— l emphatically deny that 1 wrote or
had anything to do with article in Melbourne Herald
referred to in a recent issue of The Bulletin under the
heading “Poverty Point.” The article in question is
thoroughly at variance with facts and does not in any
way coincide with my experience as Dampier’s col-
laborator. I have not quarrelled with him nor am I
likely to do so seeing that he has always treated me with
the utmost consideration. —Yours, Garnet Walcii,
Alexandra Theatre, Melbourne.
A dramatic co., which has “ new and elaborate scenery
specially painted for its new and original Australian
drama,” struck Albury the other night. One scene
depicted a city street. Two actors appeared on the stage
and placed two easy chairs in what was apparently the
middle of the street. Then one of them remarked,
“ What a pretty rustic scene !” The audience didn’t even
smile.
Melbournite wants to know’ what’s the dynamite that has

Bill Leake recounts an unrehearsed effect at a back-
blocks theatre. There were no dressing-rooms and the
actors had to change their clothes between the solitary
scene and the back wall of the building. One of the
comedians was sans culottes during the progress of the
piece, when the only barrier between himself and the
audience fell down. A loud burst of applause followed
and the actor, imagining it due to the merit of the play,
turned to Leake, saying “By gord, we’ve hit ’em .” A
glance to the rear, however, caused him to realise his
mistake, and he disappeared off the stage.
A new star is coming to Australia, Barnum Bailey s
Starr, the man who does the bill-posting, a genius in his
way, like Ben. Lusby, “Champion lightning ticket-seller
of the universe,” who used to astound the patrons as he
slapped out the tickets with both hands, the Briareus of
the box. In like manner did Starr paralyse the myrmi-
dons of Partington, the mammoth London bill-posting
man, when the Olympia show came over. The Londoners
stuck on bills laboriously and painfully sheet by sheet,
but Starr’s men would have a 24-sheeter all in one piece,
and put it up in a twinkling, with things like hay-rakes.
The play without words, in Musgrove’s Melbourne
show, went nigh knocking the bottom out of the whole
thing the first night.

The hearty Melbourne welcome given to the Graggs
appeared to indicate that many remembered them of
yore, 18 years ago, at the old Princess’, along with Harry
Sefton, the Dancing Spider, Jessie Danvers, and Airec of
the trapeze. The mother of the family used then to per-
form with them.

Melbourne Age, reporting a meeting of the unemployed*
had the artful impudence to state—“lt was announced
that the benefit entertainment given on Saturday evening
at the Theatre Royal had turned out a failure financially.
This was attributed to the fact that no advertisement
respecting it appeared in the Age.” That David Syme has
refused to accept advts. from the Royal, for reasons already
explained in these columns, is quite true. But to publish
an ignorant hypothesis that the aforesaid “ boycott” had
anything to do with the state of the Royal on this parti-
cular occasion is like David’s “cheek.” The unemployed
were to get all the receipts over £l2O on the 47th per-
formance of “ Dick Whittington,” which would scarcely
be a fat sum, anyway. At a matinee performance on the
same day, the Royal had been crowded, a fact that, on
the same line of argument, may also be attributed to the
Age’s miserable spleen.
When a big theatre is re-opened with a very thin variety
show, it might be a lucrative policy to at least engage a
decent orchestra.
What has Australia done to deserve an “ English
libretto by Burnand.” Why, Lauri’s perennial “ Whoa,

The old Australian actor, Richard Nesbitt M‘Cron,
when in ’Frisco in the rough days, had a quarrel with
Mrs. Hudson Kirby, afterwards Mrs. Stark. The lady
came to the front and complained that she had been
insulted by the “ damned Britisher.” A row arose, and
after repeated calls Nesbitt came forward and disclaimed
any intention of offending anyone. Some rough in the
pit sang out “Shoot the 1” Whereupon Nesbitt,
who was playing Richard 111., melodramatically walked to
the footlights and, opening his shirt, said : “ Fire and be
damned ! I come from a country whose men do not fear
bullets.” Hooroo!

A young and beautiful Australian actor married
recently into a “serious family.” He married a very
serious girl, and the girl had a serious mother—one who
alludes to herself as a “ vessel,” and there was a dreary,
pious aunt in the connection with flat, shiny curls and a
vinegar expression ; also a grandmother who was always
thinking of her latter end. The family objected to the
actor at first, but at length it gave way on the under-
standing that the girl had a “ call ” —we believe that is
the correct expression—to save him as a brand from
the burning. Parenthetically the present writer wishes
to mention that he also had a “call” once, but it
was a call of sixpence per share in the Golden Pyke
mine, accompanied by a lawyer’s letter, which was not a
case in point. After the marriage the bride went down
one night with a shudder to the theatre ; she felt that she
couldn’t rescue her husband from the unclean thing
unless she knew exactly what the unclean thing was,
and she went to take stock of the evil. She seemed
perplexed and discouraged by what she saw, and next
night she dug the ancient aunt out of her seclusion,
and took her along as an additional support. It is
painful to record such a fact, but these two have been at
the theatre almost every night since then. About a week
after their falling-off, the bride’s mother began to hang
round the altar of Baal—to quote her own expression ;
and then the grandmother came. And now a demoralised
“serious family’’—three generations of it —whoops
vociferously for that actor every night, and worships
him, and heaves bouquets at him, and their excitement
is a touching thing to witness. It is the only real amuse-
ment the old lady has had in all her 78 years, and she is
just beginning to be alive for the first time since the date
of Waterloo.
Clement Scott, like Burnand, is a devoted Catholic.
The Pope lately sent him a special blessing, in a silver
box, for writing down Ibsen. In fact, Scott and Burnafid
write dowm the drama, for we have seen it from both
their pens that the stage is a difficult place for a respect-
able woman.
Mrs. G. B. W. Lewds’s dramatic library was sold to Cole
a few days before her departure for England.

The Lone Fisherman has got speaking parts at last, in

The girls who carry violin-cases, presumably with

Cardinal Manning on the stage. In his well-known
book, the “Eternal Priesthood,” page 240, he quotes:
“We strictly forbid . . all ecclesiastics in sacred
orders to be present at scenic representations in public
theatres, or in places which serve for the time as a public
theatre, imposing upon the transgressors the pain of
suspension incurred thereby ipso facto, hitherto in force
in England, and reserved to the Ordinaries respectively”
(Cone. Westm. Dec. xxiv. 1). And he adds this comment;
“May this wise and wdiolesome tradition of our fore-
fathers never be relaxed. The theatre in their days was
high, intellectual, and pure compared with the modern
stage and its moral fail.” And yet we see their reverences
laughing at comedv
Not all of Gounod's works were great successes
amongst others, his “ Tribut de Lamora ” proved a per
feet failure. One day the publisher of “Faust” me.
Gounod in the street, and expressed to him his indigna-
tion at the shabby hat Gounod was wearing. " Qi.t
voulez-vous,” said the composer to Ids publisher, who bad
made a fortune of “ Faust,” “that is —the hat of Faust. ’
Afterwards Gounod sold his " Tribnt de Lamora” to the
same man for 100,000 francs (£1000). The opera was a
total failure. Gounod, in meeting bis publisher occa-
sionally, could not help expressing bis astonishment at
ids dilapidated hat; whereto the publisher dryly remarke d
“ Que voulez-vous, that is the hat of ‘ Tribut de Lamora.’ ”
Sydney city organist Wiegand has been incapacitated
for a fortnight owing to a bite from a poisonous spider—
in which was probably incorporated most of the little
soul of a venomous and still-living musical critic.
Maddison Morton’s posthumous pieces are being brought
out. The unlucky thing about him was that though hecould
write as well at eighty as at thirty, he was left stranded
high and dry by the receding wave of fashion. However,
when an author goes for ever, it always gives a fillip to
his work, as with Boucicault, whose “ Formosa,” “Streets
of London,” and “ Avrah-na-Pogue ” have been lately
revived in England with eclat. At one time, the pro-
grammes of the Haymarket, Adelphi and Lyceum
would hardly have been thought complete without one of
Maddison’s pieces. “Box and Cox” is a compound of
two French farces.
Here is how G. V. Brooke went on the stage. As a boy
of 15, looking like a man, he applied to the Dublin
manager for an engagement, but was, of course, laughed
at, and then it happened the Liverpool boat was late,
bringing over Macready. All was ready to produce
“ William Tell,” and, not to disappoint the public, the
management gave the “ stage-struck boy ” a chance, as
tire hero, by which he so profited that he jumped forth-
with into the saddle as a star, devouring all the crack-
parts with rapidity, and making a hit in every one.
While quite a boy, he acted “Virginius,” at the City of
London theatre, East End, with Cclat, but never would
begin at the bottom of the tree, as second to Macready,
like Phelps, Anderson, Creswick, and so on. Probably
bis Othello was the best ever seen. Yet, G. H. Lewes
said he never acted it so well as the first night at the
Olympic.
The proprietor and manager of the next nigger com-
pany of singers to visit Australia is Mr. Orpheus M.
M‘Adoo. Judging from his name, he should Mac-a-Do
of it.
“ The Countess of Hopetoun of a son.”
The Bulletin takes the liberty of recom-
mending Sir Henry Parkes to get his hp.vr cut.
Old man Parkes would hereupon recommend The
Bulletin to “get its tongue slit.” It is easy to
“act Parkes.”
“ Lady Tweeddale has a fortune of £9OOO
a year, and is somewhere about the age of the
Argus,” writes a London correspondent of that
journal. But seeing that her ladyship is about
to get married for the third time she probably
wears a lot better than the Argus, which is un-
mistakeably old and feeble.
A great swell, who had accepted service
under Sheriff Cowper, and whose braided frock
seemed to lift him high above the common herd,
“got the sack,” after about 48 hours’ service,
thusly. Sporting-attorney Gannon was strolling
quietly into court when the potentate barred his
way. “ I am an officer of the Court,” said Gannon.
“ Nonsense ; where’s your uniform ?” exclaimed
the man in braid. Sack.
Dear Bulletin, —The worst of fat men is
that after each spasm of energy they require such
a long period of recuperation. Barton, after his
late exceptional demonstrations, is resting once
more, and thus Premier Dibbs is allowed to run
amok among his own supporters. The “ leading ’
N.S.W. politicians who have a rudimentary
notion of tactics can be counted on one hand-
with some fingers to spare. For Dibbs to insult
Toohey is the height of folly. And O’Sullivan
and Rose have done a heap more for Protection
than G. R. Dibbs.—W.
Have not the wives of the prisoners who
have died in Parramatta gaol of typhoid fever
(admittedly caused solely by the filth of the plate
and the neglect of the Government), a good action
against the State for compensation? The N.S. W.
Government had, no doubt, a right to imprison
the men, but it had no right to kill them. The
prisoners may have lost their civil rights, but
surely their wives have not lost their civil rights.
The men were not sentenced to death. If they
were poisoned by the filth of officialdom, let the
State pay the butcher’s bill. On whose head is
the blood of these men ?
When Graham Berry said to his ban-
quetters last week—“ You must resolve that, by
one great national effort, you will restore the
credit of Victoria,” he was blatherskiting. If any
wheezy old windbag there present had called
upon Graham to explain the nature of the required
effort, and the proper way of making it, he
couldn’t have fetched an answer. The credit of
the Cabbage Garden doesn’t want restoring, any-
how. That's all right. It only requires the right
gardeners, and not any further exertion from the
fat crowd of wrong gardeners who sat around and
cheered the knighted spouter.
The elevation of A.N.A. Peacock to a
real portfolio billet in the moribund Victorian
Ministry is gall and wormwood for poor Frank
Stuart, who quarrelled with his bread because it
wasn’t buttered soon enough. Everything comes
to him who waits (provided there is something to
come and he doesn’t die before it arrives), and
Frank might have been a nominal Minister of
Education for five or six weeks but for his rash
quarrel with Munro. Now the “ Hon.” Peacock
spreads his plumage before the eyes of his erst-
while senior Minister (unattached), and Frank
feels like a “ dead bird ” that showed temper at
the post and came in with the crowd.
Last Friday Mr. Abraham Friedman,
erstwhile prince of Sydney money-lenders, ap-
peared in N.S.W. Bankruptcy Court to explain
his dealings with W. T. Muston, the bankrupt
proprietor of the partially-built Lyceum Theatre.
The solicitors’ table was loaded with piles of
Friedman’s huge, brass-bound ledgers. The first
question was, “ Are you not bankrupt yourself ?”
But Abraham replied not—only burst into a
flood of tears, which ran down his furrowed cheeks
and spluttered on the floor of the witness-stand.
The scene was an affecting one. The great
Mokanna of the bill-of-sale industry, who had
complacently put Gentiles through the mill by
the dozen, had himself practically realised what
bankruptcy meant. Truly, one touch of bung-
ness burns the whole world’s skin. After,
sobbing for some time, Abraham pulled
himself together and went on, with an
occasional sigh and tear, to explain his misfor-
tunes, which began, as is usual in such cases, with
over-prosperity. He and Muston bought a pro-
perty in 188 G, and at once sold it at a profit of
<£lo,ooo. Then he started out to own the whole
of the earth, and when he had spent <£loo,ooo on
it and locked up all the capital of his bill-broking
business, he began to borrow on mortgage. When
he got into a tight place he resumed bill-discount-
ing—and incidentally lent money to Muston at 25
per cent. Times got bad, and bills were almost
invariably dishonoured. Friedman’s bank frowned,
winked wickedly with both its eyes, opened its
mouth wide, and brought together its jaws with
steel-trap snap. Abraham had got there.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The National Association say that they
oppose class-legislation, yet they support the dual
vote, which gives one class one vote more than
the other’.
The Labour-party in Victoria hopes to
slip in the majority of their candidates against
the forces of the Conservatives, who will
probably be divided on small questions.
When Premier Shiels eulogised Berry’s
Agent-Generalship at the banquet given to
Surgrame, someone ejaculated “Why didn’t you
leave him in London?” Then Shiels got nasty
and asked for “courtesy.”
There is a decided movement to retrench
in the Victorian Civil Service —another Black
Wednesday. In Maoriland they apply to the
Service M. Catalani’s recipe for an opera Co. :
“My wife and four or five puppets.”
Once more it is rumoured that Judge
Boucaut (S. A.) intends to resume politics—that ho
will resign, and run for a country constituency on
returning from his leave. It is his ambition to
ultimately sit in the Federal Parliament.
The Armidale “ Freetrade and Liberal”
Association has asked the parent association in
Sydney to drop the word Liberal.” There is a
sense of eternal fitness in the request. In Aus-
tralia, Freetrade has always meant Conservative.
In Great Britain, in 1864, the last return
given under the old Masters and Servants Act,
recorded that for that year alone 10,246 working-
men had been imprisoned at the suit of their
masters. And masters at the suit of the men ?
None !
Note how Griffith and Playford kootoo to
Kintore! All this is an outcome of his trip North,
and his memo, on foreign labour. One feels un-
easily that the whole is a “ put-up job,” and it is
memorable that Kintore expressed his annoyance
at the memo, being published.
With the new railways now in course of
construction, W.A. has nearly 600 miles of State
lines. This with private lines makes a total of
1200 miles in the province. Treasurer Forrest
anticipates that for 1892 the Government railways
will have a surplus over expenditure.
In the revision of the Melbourne and
suburban rolls, for every elector removed from
the manhood suffrage list by reason of criminal
conviction, there were thirty-three taken off the
ratepayers’ and property-holders’ rolls. After
this, the National Association had better advocate
a vote for Theft.
The Brisbane Chamber of Commerce has
passed a unanimous vote of thanks to Psalmyell
Griffith for his resolution to start black labour
once more in the North. When an institution
like the Chamber of Commerce congratulates a
person like Griffith it makes us think somehow of
a sweater congratulating a hangman.
Sydney Daily Telegraph’s parliamentary
humorist, airing his literary erudition, alludes to
Premier Dibbs’ attitude on the rejection by the
N.S.W. Upper House of the Government’s Elec-
toral Bill, by paralleling it with that of the hero
of a novel by James Payn, entitled “ What Will
He Do With It ?” And this is fame !
According to a Maoriland cablegram, Mr.
A. J. Oadman is now to be known as Minister for
Marine and Stamps. This is getting things down
pretty fine. By-and-by, the Maorilanders will
find that the wretched Cadman is overloaded, and
they will make him simply Minister for the pic-
ture on the front of the stamps, and appoint
somebody else Minister for the gum on the back.
The cabled resignation of Premier Frey-
cinet and Government, arises out of their pro-
posed measures divorcing State and Church. In
the last census, eight millions of French declined
to specify their religion, and were so returned,
but in all former censuses this class was returned as
Catholic ! A dodge not unknowm in Australia—
in another way.
A big attempt is being made to secure
Indian immigration for the Northern Territory.
J. L. Parsons, M.P., ex-Government Resident,
wants the Government to encourage the con-
tinuous immigration of “Tamils ” (Madras cheap
labour). Those “in the know ” allege that Pre-
mier Playford personally favours cheap coolie
labour, and that is what he is visiting India for.
The London Evening News on Booth’s
agricultural “colony
In the wood-cutting department the hands are very
badly underpaid, and the commodity sold under market
price. At this rate Booth will be a social curse. He gets
his capital for nothing, sweats the worker, undersells the
traders, and does all the mischief we predicted.
If we must have sweaters, let us have them with-
out religious trimmings.
Item by one Johnson, of South Australia :
“If everyone who showed his head above his
fellows was to be hit on it, a man would put his
wealth into a stocking and sit over it with a club.”
Quite true, Johnson. And at the present time
any man on the downward track who shows his
feet underneath the rest gets his corns shot at.
There are two sides to every question, and they
ought both to be considered.
The greater the increase in wealth the
less its purchasing power and the higher the
standard of comfort in the community. This is
the law of compensation which shows that human
contentment is neither possible nor desirable.
Socialists ask for the right to lead a comfortable
existence, not believing, as is popularly supposed,
that this carries with it that oysterlike sense of
satisfaction which precludes humanity from
striving eternally at the realisation of higher social
ideals.
“ Will £2O a ton duty on flour make wheat
grow free from rust ? ” demanded Three-Hat
Davies when the N.S.W. Council was considering
the Customs Duties Bill. The Bulletin is of
opinion that it won’t. Neither would £2O
duty on Chinamen make rain fall at Wilcannia,
which is quite as sensible a remark when you look
at it carefully. And, for that matter, Parkes’dead-
house wouldn’t help to clear up the accounts of
the old Casual Labour Board, would it ?
The petition presented to the N.S.W.
Council against the Customs Bill contains over
24,000 signatures, and the thing that troubles the
Council now is that scores of them seenuto be in
the same hand. The Foreign-trade Association
paid by results only—so much for each hundred
signatures—and, therefore, the miserable can-
vassers filled them in by hundreds as the only
way of making a decent living out of the industry.
Will anybody dare to compare that petition with
HE HAD THE SYMPTOMS.
HEAVY FATHER: “Back on my hands again, eh? Well, upon my word, Bill, if you
ain’t the most useless-hang it, I’ve tried you in everything from bus-drivin’ to
a clerkship in the Lands, and you don’t seem to have brains enough to keep any
billet; I am completely discouraged and disgusted, and I’m blest if I know
what avenue there is open to a man of your capacity—damme, you must
be a genius!”
the latest Sydney directory and see if even 20 per
cent of the alleged petitioners can be traced ?
One of the conditions of the contract for
the construction of the West Australian Midland
Railway is the introduction of 5000 adult
Europeans. They are engaged in London,
as railway-laborers, at ss. per day, and when
they commence work, ninepence" per day is
deducted from their wages to repay the passage-
money advanced to bring them and their families
to the province. The “truck system” is per-
mitted— i.e., the contractor supplies his own men,
from his own stores, at his own prices. The
imported labourers now realise that they are not
as well off as they were in London.
That big, hunky statesman, Patterson,
seems to have practically vanished out of Vic-
torian politics. Among all Australian politicians
he was the nearest to Bret Harte’s portrait of that
“strong man,” General Gashwiler, of the TJ.S.
Congress. People took him for an intellectual
giant because he used to talk so loud and frown so
villainously, and bang his fist so fearfully when he
talked about the unemployed, but he was only a
screamer and banger after all. While he held office
he was a great man on account of the horrid row
he made with his feet; now hardly anybody seems
to feel sure that he is alive—or that he ever was
alive for that matter.
An ardent Freetrade fanatic asks in the
press how it is that in the professedly Protec-
tionist Australias constant efforts towards recipro-
city are being brought forward in self-stultifica-
tion? Just as in the U.S. interested reciprocity
is desirable, so in Australia is interprovincial
reciprocity beneficial because the members of these
neighbouring States all live under a similar
standard of social comfort. When the world’s
workers comply with what Australians and
Americans consider to be the essential conditions
of domestic comfort then and then only will they
meet the world’s producers on the broad platform
of International Freetrade.
Froude writes to Parkes a letter con-
gratulating him upon “his splendid efforts for the
Confederation of Australia.” The irony of it —
Mrs. Candour in breeches complimenting Tar-
tuffe ! But the letter proves nothing except that
Froude doesn’t understand the least bit of what
he is writing about. The “Confederation” of
the Australias was proposed by no one. Parkes’
plan meant a unification —one strong Government,
the rest shadows. The Draft Bill implies a
federation with a strong Executive. A Confedera-
tion is a temporary and loose union with a weak
Central Executive. Parkes’ vanity, of course,
prompted the immediate publication of the absurd
letter.
Dear Bulletin, — Speaking to a Sydney
friend the other day on political subjects I was
struck by the strange opinions he held, and his
estimate of the personnel of the present Protection-
ist N.S. W. Ministry. I asked him if he had read a
certain speech delivered from the Ministerial
benches on the question we were discussing, and
his reply was, “No! I never read the speeches.
I find it easier to read the leading articles in the
morning papers—in fact, I get all my information
on political subjects by doing so—it is the
quickest way.’’ J ust imagine the state of a man’s
mind who derives his political information solely
from reading the articles in Sydney’s morning
papers ! If there are many more like him, and no
doubt there are, is it any wonder that the
imported-shoddy-party has reigned so long in
N.S. Wales? When are the protectionists going
to wake up and produce that new morning paper ?
—Yours, F.T.
What might have eventuated into a pretty
dispute as to the supremacy of the Central
Government has just been avoided in Canada by
the knuekling-down of the Dominion Cabinet.
The Quebec Government instituted a royalty on
mine-yields. This the Central Government—
patently in the interests of English investors—at
first disallowed, but, afterwards finding that the
Provincial Legislature stood to its guns, approved.
The tremendous centralisation of the Canadian
federal system reduces State autonomy to a mini-
mum ; and when a province can, single-handed,
defeat the Federal or Central power, it is a con-
vincing sign of the break-up of the system. The
Canadian Federation was, in short, Sir John
Macdonald, and as soon as “Old To-morrow”
was numbered with the defuncts his system began
to totter to the grave after him. Australians
should not forget that it was Parkes’ idea—the
one for which he has just been congratulated by
Fronde—to federate the Australias on the Cana-
dian model.
Dear Bulletin, —ls the new Victorian
Ministry quite the feeble, purposeless, stop-gap
affair that people take it for? Shiels is not the
huge, brawny, bounceable sort of person who fills
the popular idea of a strong man ;heis np '
his work, and Ins colleagues are mostly new i i t(
wise; but considering how feeble the old llke
artful variety of politician often proves hi,‘
that fact alone counts for very little ?
is a sort of impression in some quarters th*
Shiels is, after all, nearly as brainy as tlY 13
and that he may ultimately prove ahm.t rry '
tenacious. The country is divided befw a!
two opinions—one being that Berry will ,l' eet ’
spine kind of an ultimatum and that the 1 Hhf 1 } 1
Government will dissolve there and then whu
the other idea is that Shiels will put the ultimnf,
m the ash-heap and never turn a hair. A Ulfl
very few—go as far as to imagine that Shiels win
just send round a post-card to inform TU
that he is abolished, and end the difficulty rCKf
there, ibis latter party has risen through fh
fact that the Argus now foretells Shiels’ iL . 0

Mr. Edward Langton, who was in pre-
historic times a prominent public man in mV
bourne, got out of the grave of his past reputation
the other day to tell the supporters of the One
man-one-vote principle that “his reading of hi!'
tory showed him that more than half the ev h
that befel the French during the French Revolt
tion occurred through the absolutely foolish do!
trine of Equality.” Indeed. We were under th!
impression that it was the class that scouted th !
doctrine that come off badly at that period. But
Mr. Langton reads his own ideas into history no
doubt. A few lines Q
The French Revolution, eh?
A reign of Terror, you say ?
Have your way.
The Serfs learnt then that the gay
Nobles were, just as they,
Common clay;
And, ’twixt them and the highly-bred
The diff’rence nought to dread—• 5
Just a head.
Scarcely an aristocrat
Had any use for a hat
After that.
Then did the State advance,
And ev’ry man had his chance—■
So had France.
The furious Marseillaise
Set half the world in a blaze
In those days.
Men of the Langton breed
Had better, in time, take heed,
Or, indeed,
They may hear from a grim-eyed throng
A similar tune and song,
Before long.
The Ladies’ Friend.
For ladies of all ages, from the time of birth
until old age, at all critical times, and during all
constitutional changes which are peculiar to the
sex, Clements Tonic surpasses all other prepara-
tions. During the critical period of youth it
braces up the system, and has a beneficial, stimu-
lating and permanent effect on the several im-
portant organs and processes which govern the
female economy, for weak, cachectic and anaemic
gills, with tliG usiicil pale lips, pasty skin, dark
circles around the eyes, torturing headaches, and
suppression of periodical functions, Clements
-1 0111 c is especially indicated. Tor married ladies
it is as essential as the daily meals, for during the
penod of gestation there is a great strain on the
blood m supplying the necessary amount of
material for the formation of the foetus, and unless
the blood is sufficiently rich to afford this nourish-
ment, the physical system must suffer and the
necessary matter will he drawn from the bones
and tissues of the mother, thus rendering her
weak and unable to stand the strain of parturition
without collapse. Clements Tonic supplies the
female with great power, and is especially valuable
to women during gestation and subsequent lacta-
tion ; it forces by natural means all healthy
secretions, and repairs all losses, and prevents the
physical decay so frequent with ladies at these
times. Neuralgia is one of the most frequent and
reliable signs that the system is breaking down,
that wear and tear is making inroads into the
strength, and that the blood, from various causes,
is becoming weak, and that unless proper restora-
tive treatment is resorted to, the patient becomes
weak and debilitated, and then some serious
disease attacks her, and her health, perhaps life,
is sacrificed, and all because gocd advice is
neglected. Clements lonic is used all over Aus-
tralia, by ladies of all ages and in all stations of
life ; everyone speaks well of it and knows that it
is the best, because it is prepared and sold with a
view to doing good, and must be beneficial as it
contains the material to make it so. Miss Alice
Holland, schoolmistress, Townsville (Q.), writes; —
“ I desire to express my gratitude for the benefit
I have got from Clements Tonic and Dr. Fletcher’s
pills. Ever since my childhood X have been weak,
nervous, and a victim to neuralgia, the most
excruciating agony of all. After the usual failures
of doctors I tried Clements Tonic, and 10 bottles
have made me a different person altogether. I
have gained two stone in weight, am strong,
healthy, and vigorous, and all is due to Clements
ionic, for nothing did me any good till I used
that medicine. I don’t mind if you publish this
for it is really true.”

still growing by leaps and bounds, is no less than
.£778,000,000 against Russia’s £563,000,000,
France’s £480,000,000, and Britain’s £251,000,000.
She has 222 acres under grain for every
100 inhabitants against France’s 97, Britain’s
28, and Australia’s 125. In America,
chiefly by virtue of superior machinery, nine
millions of farm hands raise nearly half as much
grain as the 66 millions of European labourers.

that she was spurred to a medical career by her

The Sydney murderer, Bertrand, has now
been in gaol 26 years. He has had all the time
the most powerful influence at work for his
release, but unavailingly—because a ihost influ-
ential person (against whose family Bertrand com-
mitted a grave offence) has worked in the opposite
direction. Bertrand cannot live much longer, we
are told. His case shows that after all it is pos-
sible to substitute imprisonment for life for
capital punishment.
Victoria’s new Minister of Defence, George
Davis, is a farming squatter from Tinamba,
Gippsland, and is loaded up with poetry and the
drama. In the early days of his sprouting ambi-
tion Davis would mount his steed and retire to a
lonely aboriginal cromlech on his run, and harangue
an imaginary host, declaim against the foul in-
gratitude of his enemies, and threaten the quiver-
ing caitiffs within the Capitol. He was a fine-
looking fellow, physically a Macbeth ; he was
always in the heroic, denunciatory business, and
the immediate result of it all was that he became an
alderman !
There died last week in Hobart an old
“ Swinger ’’—that is to say, a convict transported
(in 1832) for incendiarism. When the terrible
agricultural depression of the Early Thirties pre-
vailed in England, numberless farmers’ ricks and
barns were burnt—and the farming hands all
over the country accused an imaginary person,
“Swing,” of having caused them. The man who
passed away last week was at John Price’s wed-
ding in old St. David’s. Being then one of the
Government House garden hands (under assign-
ment) he had taken some green stuff and flowers
to help decorate the chancel. He had only to go
a tew hundred yards, but two sbldiers were told
off to escort him.
Professor Jenks should have stuck to
Victoria. He had a futurq before him at the

wonderful energy, tenacity of purpose, and, for his
years, great learning, and gifted with the faculty
of tersely vigorous speech, he could have held his
own with any man now at the Southern Bar;
and, as for Parliament, his avowedly popular
sympathies would have given him a tight grip on
the democracy. Perhaps, though, he would not
have stayed in Melbourne. The close of his life’s
romance came with a sudden tragioness. The

Editor Bulletin.—Sir,—l should have
liked to add to your truthful and eulogistic
remarks concerning the late Dr. Ulrich Hlibbe,
of South Australia, draftsman and originator of
the Torrens’ Act, the story of how the S.A.
Government was badgered year after year to do
something to assist the poor old scholar in Ins
declining years. It resulted eventually in the
grant of a lump sum of .£3OO, and a certain M.i ~
seeing that the doctor was very old, blind*, 1 and
infirm, offered, on deposit of this sum, an annuity
of .£SO per annum, which was accepted. To the
surprise of all, however, the old man lived some
14 years afterwards. The Doctor was one of the
most unselfish, unbusinesslike, and gentle creatures
that ever lived, and I am not sorry that he has
gone where he will be better appreciated.—Yours,
Artist.
Allan M‘Lean, the new Victorian Chief
Secretary, is Scotch, and comes of a Catholic clan;
but from a devout Roman he became a Pres-
byterian. The M’Lean family settled in Gipps-
land in the fifties and long occupied the bleak
and sterile run called the “ Lowlands,” between
the Ninety-mile Beach and Sale. Next to them
were the Macdonalds, and on the Latrobe River
were the Campbells, who, ignoring the reason
why they should adopt any other name than that,
especially in such propinquity, called their squat-
tage “ Glencoe.” The M'Leans were starved out
of the “Lowlands” by foot-rot and fluke, and
Allan took to auctioneering at Sale and
Maffra, and incidentally to political economy. In
the evolution of time he became a Minister in
Munro’s Cabinet, and now he.is ancient to Slnels.
Mr. M‘Lean bears the reputation of being honest,
genial and modest.
George Cheeke’s father (brother of the
late N S W. Judge) and the late Lord Sandys are
the two benefactors to whom we owe that
universally-popular compound, Worcestershire
sauce They were old cronies, and hons vivants to
boot, and between them they concocted the sauce,
They used to get it made up by Lea, who was a
chemist in Worcester, and after a time he asked
for permission to sell it, promising to keep the
mixture secret. Little thinking what they were
giving away, they consented. The rest is known,
Lea died a millionaire, and big fortunes have been
made out of the sauce since, Mr. Lea’s gratitude
ran the length of sending to each of them a dozen
’ bottles every year, and that is all they got out of
it. On each bottle may be read “ Prepared from
the recipe of a nobleman in the county.” That
was Lord Sandys ; but it was Mr. Cheeke who
suggested the ingredient which really made the
sauce what it is.
m. ,• „ p iK. lotoo
The intimation of the tolerably lar 0 e
amount (,£34,000) left by the late Bishop t erry,
formerly of Melbourne, recalls that he refused
large grants of land from Gov Latrobe for
“ glebe” or church purposes. Latrobe a regular
stickler for precedents, and a goody-goody to boot,
believed in the State endowment of religion
especially of the Protestant section He gave
Perry to understand that a formal application for
glebe lands in every parish would meet with Ins
strongestapproval, and as constitutional machinery
was then only just getting into working order,
such enormous powers rested in the Governor’s
hands that there is no doubt the grants would
have been made. To the huge loss of the Anglican
Church in Victoria, however, and to the corres-
gain of the community a. large, the
Bishop held the extreme evangelical belief which
trusts directly to Providence. He refused to act
on Latrobe’s suggestion, and assured his Excel-
lency “ that the Lord would provide for the wants
of His servants.” Fine old Alfred Woolley (to
whose intelligent philanthropy Melbourne charities
of the genuine sort owe so much—he used to give
first and enquire afterwards), when the Bishop
told him of the offer, months later, remarked
“Why, Bishop, the Lord was then and there
making provision for the Church !” Woolley,
speaking of the incident to the writer, said that
the Bishop was confounded at that view of the
matter—“it had never occurred to him!” The
Victorians ought to be grateful to Perry’s mental
density. The first Anglican Bishop of N.S.W.
was dense enough in all, conscience, but when it
was a question of getting at the State, he was all
there—and always.

David Lindsay, the commander of the
unlucky “Elder Exploring Expedition,” is a most
religious man, but his incessant prayers for rain
seemed to have such an effect upon his subor-
dinates (Afghans included) that when they
reached the first settlement (Geraldton) they
resigned almost to a man. And this costly expe-
dition, fitted out by Sir Thomas Elder, has accom-
plished nothing of any consequence. Apropos ,

Francine.
(BULLETIN TRANSLATION.)
She met Jacques and she loved him. It lasted
six months. They were brought together m
springtime, they parted in the autumn. 1 rancxne
was consumptive ; she knew it, and Jacques knew
it also. A fortnight after the young girl came to
him he learned it from one of his friends, who was
a doctor. “She will leave you when the leaves
become yellow,” he said.
Francine surprised this confidence and perceived
the despair of her friend.
“Why trouble about the yellow leaves?” said
she, with all her love smiling on her lips. “ Why
trouble about the autumn —we are in the midst of
summer and the leaves are green; profit by it,
my friend. When you see me preparing to leave
the world fold me in your arms with a kiss and
forbid me to go. lam obedient, you know, and
will stay.”
And thus, for five months, Francine endured
all the miseries of a Bohemian life with a laugh
and a song on her lips. _ .
As for Jacques, he let himself be deceiyed. His
friend would sometimes say : “ Francine is getting
worse, take care of her.” Then Jacques would
scour Paris seeking the wherewithal to carry out
the doctor’s orders; but Francine would never
hear it spoken of, and threw their drugs out of
the window. At night, when the cough laid hold
of her, she would creep from the room and on to
the landing so that Jacques might not hear her.
One day when they were together in the country,
Jacques noticed a tree whose foliage was already
fading. He glanced sadly at Francine who was
moving slowly—dreaming by his side.
She saw him change countenance, and under-
stood the reason of his pallor. ...
“ How foolish you are ! ” said she kissing him,
“ this is but July ; there are three months yet to
October ; loving one another —as we do —night and
day, we shall double the time that we have to pass
together. Besides, if I feel myself getting worse
as the leaves turn yellow, we will go and live in a
wood whose leaves are evergreen.
In October Francine was not able to leave her
bed. Their friend, the doctor, attended her. The
little room in which they lodged was high up in
the house and looked out upon a courtyard, where
grew a tree whose foliage disappeared day by day.
Jacques had hung a curtain across the window in
order to hide this tree from the sick girl; but
Francine ordered him to remove it.
“ Oh, my love,” she said, “I will give you a
hundred times more kisses than it has leaves,”
and she added, “besides, I am getting much
better ; I shall be able to go out soon ; but as it is
sure to be cold, and I hate to have red hands, you
must buy me a muff ’’—and through all her illness
this muff was her only whim.
On All Saints’ Eve, seeing that Jacques was
sadder than ever, and in order to cheer him, she
got up.
Just then the doctor arrived and forced her
back to bed.
“Jacques,” whispered he to the artist, be
brave ! this is the end. Francine must die.”
Jacques burst into tears.
“ Give her anything she wants now,” added the
doctor, “ there is no hope.”
Francine heard with her eyes what the doctor
had told her lover.
“Do not listen to him,” she cried, stretching
h.er arms towards Jacques. “Do not listen to
him, he lies. We will go out together to-morrow.
It is All Saints’ Day ; it will be cold, go and buy
my muff. Do go, I am afraid of getting chil-
blains this winter.” . ...
Jacques was going out with his friend, but
Francine kept the doctor beside her.
“ Go and get my muff,” she said to her lover ;
“ get me a nice one to last a long time.”
And when she was alone with the doctor
“ Oh, sir, I know I am dying, but before my time
comes can you not give me back my strength for
a night—only make me beautiful again for a
night, and then I can die, since it is the will of
the good God that I may live no longer ?”
As the doctor was trying to soothe her, an
autumn breeze swept into the room and threw on
the sick girl’s bed a yellow leaf—torn from the
tree in the little courtyard.
Francine threw the curtain aside and saw that
the tree was completely bare.
“It is the very last one!” said she, slipping
the leaf beneath her pillow. #
“ You will last till to-morrow,” said the doctor,
“ you have still a night before you.”
“Ah, what happiness !” said the young girl;
“ a winter night; it will be long.”
Jacques came in with her muff.
“What a pretty one,” said she, “ I will put it
on when I go out with you.”
The night passed.
The morrow, All Saints Day, at the midday
Angelus, convulsions seized her, her whole body
trembled.
“My hands are cold,” she whispered, “Give
me my muff.” And she buried her poor little
hands in its fur.
“ This is the end,” said the doctor to Jacques—
“ go and kiss her.”
Jacques pressed his lips to those of his lover.
At the last moment he wished to draw the muff
away, but she held it tight.
“No, no,” she said, “let me keep it, it is
winter, I am cold, oh, so cold ; ah, my poor boy,
ah, my poor Jacques; what will become of you ?”
And Jacques was left alone.— From the French
of Henri Murger.

“Mr. O’Connor hgs certainly surpassed himself in the
writing of this intensely interesting work. . . . No
newspaper notice, however full, can give any adequate
impression of the career as is here depicted of the great
Irishman who has gone. Mr. O’Connor’s hook itself should
be in the hands of everyone who is interested in the
brilliant and stormy career which is ended for ever.

Two absolute essentials for the existence
of the human race are—land and air. Many
economic and political systems have been invented
and are advocated for obtaining land for each
individual to live upon, but it has been left to the
Hydraulic Cooling and Ventilating Co.to intro-
duce pure air into every habitation in Australia,
by means of their “Perfection” Cooler and
Ventilator. By attaching this machine to your
water supply or tank, and simply turning on the
tap, a constant stream of pure, fresh air can be
obtained in any chamber you desire. Punkahs
are thus superseded, perishable goods can be kept
at a small expense without ice, and you can enjoy
the luxury of a cool chamber on the hottest day or
night. The machine, which is simplicity itself,
works at the cost of one half-penny per day, while
the price brings it within the reach of most.
Send for particulars or inspect the machines work-
ing in our offices. T. A. Knight and Co., St.

Thus a London correspondent There
has always been a wide-spread belief in Sydney
that a certain individual whose name it will be
unnecessary to mention is a full-blown baronet in
his own right, and, if I am not mistaken, when
his son some years ago married a wife, he an-
nounced himself in the first column of the Herald
as “Son of Sir So-and-so, Bart.” I have never
been able to find the name in any copy of the
baronetage which I have come across, and I
happened to mention the fact to “ Tony ” Foster,
who is a recognised authority on such matters,
being the proprietor of one of those “ books for
snobs.” He laughed and said: “My dear boy,
you may depend upon it that every man who lias
an atom of a claim to a title is in my book. You
may take it from me that your friend is not a
baronet.” Thus was another idol shattered;
another cherished illusion dispelled. Now, if my
friend (the mention of whose name brings back
recollections of delicious cocktails, which he so
deftly concocted) has any wish to have his name
recorded in Debrett or Burke, he must at once
send in his claim properly authenticated.
* * *
There is a certain Victorian baronet, by
the way, whose right to a title is extremely doubt*
ful, and one at least of the compilers of a baronet-
age has serious thoughts of omitting his Ham®
from the new edition.

A recent big Sydney defaulter has, it is
said, been assisted by his father-in-law to the
extent of many thousands. However, when all
was disclosed, the old man, finding his inclina-
tions and his resources alike unequal to so gigantic
a strain, was forced to throw the ruined gambler
to the wolves. One of the worst aspects of the
case is that the honourable and popular men with
whom the offender has been professionally asso-
ciated suffer severely by his misdeeds. The
defaulter’s fall again illustrates the fable of tiro
boy and the nuts.

The servant-girl question is greatly exer-
cising the gilded dames of Hobart, who would im-
port the genuine article from ’Ome wholesale only
for the preliminary difficulty of putting down ,£lB
passage-money per head for the abigails. As a
warning to importers of general servants from
England the experience of a prominent Tasmanian
M.P. stands high. He and his wife recently
brought out with them three picked girls for their
household. Tiring of the quiet monotony of
Hobart, the three damsels advantaged themselves
of the missus’s absence to depart silently for Mel-
bourne after obtaining their cheques from the
master—who has since been rescued from his
mansion in an emaciated condition whilst trying
to eat chops of his own cooking brought home in
his hat.

In a new English novel called “A Jealous
Woman,” the hero (an Australian), is described
as “very simple and unsophisticated, like all his
countrymen who have not had the advantage of
attending an English school.” The same novel
first describes the hero as only having one arm,
and at the finish says that “ he sat with his head
upon his hands, the personification of despon-
dency.”

The insolvency of a certain money-lender
recalls an early incident of his career as a fin-
ancier. Two youths, relatives, one nineteen, the
other twenty, scions of wealthy families in the
Mudgee district, found themselves “stone-broke”
on the last day of a big Sydney race-meeting, and
applied to Mr. (let us call him) Napthali for .£2OO
on a jointly-signed bill. He “did” it—at one
month, and they had to sign for .£3OO. They laid
the .£2OO on the family horse, won <£Boo, and
within three days turned up again at Napthali’s
to tender him £250, and ask him to cry quits.
He declined, demanded his pound of flesh, and
said he could afford to wait the full month. Then
they told him he was a disgrace to his tribe, that
they were both under-age, and that they would
pay him nothing—to which resolution they have
religiously adhered ever since. Had they paid

Under the style of The Royal Auglo-
Australian Society of Artists a local syndicate
has just opened what is practically a foreign
picture-gallery and market at Melbourne Exhibi-
tion. It is mainly Anglo, and in a minor degree
German. Where the Australian colour is to come
mit would be difficult to say. Melbourne artists,
anyhow, had no official intimation of the Society’s
existence until five days before the opening, when
they received a circular asking them to kindly
send along any works not previously exhibited.
Obviously the promoters have not laid themselves
out to assist Australian art.

The lifeless body of a young milkman has
been found lying, face downwards, across a dried
creek near Geelong. “It is regarded as a case of
suicide.”—
He took his bucket to the creek,
Put found the creek had dried J

He’d lost the milk he came to Seek :
“ My cow,” he cried, <! has sprung a leak !”
Then killed himself—and died.

Seventeen persons were reported as lepers
in N.S.W. during 1891, and ten of them were
found really to have leprosy. One of the five
whites died very soon after his discovery. The
number, detained on 31st December was 21, of
whom eight were whites—six male and two
female. Blessed be the Chow cheap labour wlvch
hath brought about this promising commence-
ment ! A few more years of unrestricted Chowism
and all Australia would-be feeling its ears every
morning for signs of leprous thickening.

We have received the first number of the
Woman, a monthly journal issued in .Sydney and
intended to advocate the interests of the sex. It
is a nice-looking little publication, and is run by
two men. There is no cast-iron reason why a
woman's paper should be run by a woman—if
there was, then a pastoral journal ought to be
edited by a hen and a bull; but still, as Woman
must be to some extent a protest against the over-
bearing attitude assumed by man, it seems a pity
that it should have to hire two men to enter that
protest. Nobody can ever kick himself half so
well as he can be kicked by somebody else.

Some heavy rains which took place
recently in Dunedin (M.L.) led to a revelation of
one more of the Unsuspected horrors that hang
like a pall over otir provisions. One of the sewers
in the principal street got blocked, and as the
adjacent buildings were rapidly becoming Hooded
tremendous efforts Were made to get at the
obstruction. Then it was discovered that a
gentleman in the fish trade, probably with a view
to saving the cost of ice-chests, was in the habit of
enclosing his fine fresh soles and flounders and
barraconta in boxes, and lowering them into the
cool, damp, clammy drain among the refuse, and
the rats, the cold mephitic gases, the ancient pig’s
feet, and other horrors. Truly the only decent
way to live is to be a fasting man, or else to set up
as a cannibal and select your dinner fresh every
day as it runs past your door after taking its bath.
If you eat meat the chances are that tin- butcher
has sat on it in his cart, and if you eat fish it may
have come out of a sewer. When you buy tea
some Chinaman has had his feet in it, and Heaven
only knows what kind of individual made the
bread —whether he did it with his fingers or his
toes. Then strange niggers have been fooling
around with the sugar and the coffee —in fact
every kind of provision has some ghastly horror of
its own attached to it. And, now we come to
think of it, it is only a few weeks since we saw
an advertisement in the Age about an owner
wanted for a set of false teeth discovered in a
mud-punt.

There is in a Sydney suburb a married
religious crank who will eat fire or break eggs era
long. The other day he planted his month-old
baby up to its darling neck in the cold earth,
then, kneeling beside it, he lifted up his voice in
exultant hallelujahs, and holding a watering-pot
in his right hand turned a shower-bath on the
cherub’s desolate head. He wished to force its
growth; The poor, helpless, blessed &c., was
rescued by its rna. This crank, however, can’t
compare with Brisbane’s highly original and
humorously-demented religionist, who often
interrupts a whole congregation with “Mr.
Parson ! My Lord, ask the dotty rascal in front to
leave the church. Yesterday he told me to go to
- . ’ Or else, “Lady Angelina Simper, stop
that cursed grinning while I pray.” Or, to some
Urchin : “ Master Impudence, refrain from thrust-
ing out thy damned tongue at me.” Religion
plays the devil with some men.

Mr. James Harp, a very old identity who
died recently at Auckland (M.L,), aged 89, was
celebrated in earlier days-for the way in which he
kept his accounts. He owned about the first store
that existed in the city, and traded in almost
everything. In those primitive times Harp
couldn’t afford a book-keeper, and, therefore, he
kept his own books on a plan of his own invention.
Being the owner of a much-neglected education,
he was accustomed, when he gave Credit, to make
a sketch of the customer in a huge, dirty ledger,
and alongside it he drew the article sold. Very
often nobody save himself could identify the
customer, for Mr. Harp’s cartoons were wild and
erratic ; sometimes the artist himself lost the run
of the subject, and then he trusted to his memoiy.
In one case, when the buyer positively refused to
recognise an account for a cheese, Harp lost his
temper, and sued him for the money. He pro-
duced his ledger as corroborative evidence, and
there, sure enough, in one corner was a sketch of
a horrible-looking man, with no body and his legs
joined right on to his head, running away with a
rollnd object which might have been a cheese, or,
again, it might have been a wheel or a hoop. The
defendant cheerfully admitted that the man was
probably meant for him, but he positively denied
all knowledge of the circular substance. There
was a long pause while the court thought hard
over the evidence. Then suddenly Mr. Harp
lifted up his voice in considerable excitement.
“My word,” he said, “it wasn’t a cheese, it was
a grindstone. I disremembered to put in the
hole.” The defendant remembered the grind-
stone, and Jim got his money.

The name of bachelor is sometimes a
reproach among men. A bachelor in N.S.W. Civil
Service, who lately applied for an increase in
salary, was informed by his official chief that
although his abilities warranted an increase, such
increase could not be granted because the appli-
cant was not a married man. A certain member
of the Queensland Land Board used to take the
same stand towards his officers when he filled the
post of Surveyor-General.

He was 80 and wealthy, and she 20 and
penniless, and she married him, notwithstanding
she had a fond and youthful lover. He died and
left her .£l5O weekly so long as she remained un-
married, the sum to be reduced to one pound if
she remarried. And she won’t re-marry—to the
profound disgust of his adult children, who would
then come in for the cash. But the course of true
love smoothly runs for all that. The lover has
his lass, and they snap their fingers at Mrs.
Grundy and live happily, if unconventionally.

In Tasmania they are asking what the

containing a list of directors of a proposed labour-

who stole a large amount of money from the

the case against him was as clear as daylight.

attitude assumed in a Sydney court last week
by Stipendiary Giles in a case in which police-
men were charged with having accepted bribes
from a totalisator-man. The Bulletin expresses
no opinion concerning the particular case under

business openly and illegally done by the totalisa-

somebody has been well “greased.”

exhausted his patience one day, he complained to
the manager, characterised the boys as a lot of
blockheads, and asserted that not one in twenty
could tell him where London or New York was.

he manager was incredulous. The assistant-
manager then asked one of the boys, who was
standing by, if he knew where London or New
York was? The lad failed to answer the question.
Out of a dozen or so boys interrogated, one thought
jjew York was in America, but would not venture
an opinion as to whether it was in North or South
America. None of them could say where London

One lad was not sure whether Sydney was the
capital of Melbourne, or Melbourne the capital of

Somebody sends us
the programme of a
Catholic church art-union
or lottery swindle, and
one of the statements on
the document reads as
follows : —“ Collectors
and contributors will
participate in the numer-
,ms Masses and Prayers
of the Fathers.” This
ooks well; the man who
Iraws a shapeless pair of
naby’s shoes or a toast-
rack will have his soul
poked after into the
oargain, and the more
plentiful individual who
doesn’t draw anything
will at least have the
unseen spiritual influence
of the Church thrown in.
But we knew a man who
■vent into exactly the
.s..iue kinri of a raffle once,
and someuow lie seemed
to have got the numerous
curses ot the Fathers in-
stead of their prayers. In
the first place, he never
heard the result of the
drawing Secondly, lie
took ten tickets in a
Cup sweep, thinking that
the Church might get
him a horse, and he drew
10 blanks. Thirdly, he
married a blu-hing girl
in Rockhampton (Q.)
after only three days’
acquaintance, and found
immediately afterwards
that she was a widow
(with four children in
Sydney). And now lie
wants to know where the
assistance of the Fathers
comes in, and so does the
writer, for the only time
heeve r had the assistance
of a Father was when
he asked one of them to
tell him the shortest road
to Mansfield (Vic.).
Whereupon the good
man, being buried in
profound contemplation
and thinking of the
saints, directed him on the
wrong track, and he
walked 16 miles over a
horribly rough- country
and fell over a precipice,
and arrived in a strange
place where he was nearly
32 miles from his clean
shirt, and he had to sleep
in a deserted hut and
walk back next day.

A daily literary organ
informed the Mel-

day that the Rev. C. H.

wrote to his friend, Lady Mordaunt, he told her
to be sure and lay up.

Amongst the deaths recently announced
was that of little Levi Mandelson, of the Tumut.
His father used to keep the best hotel in Goul-
burn in byegone days. Old Mandelson was a
great man in Freemasonry, and the local lodge
was held in his house. A certain Civil-servant
had been induced to join the mystic brotherhood,
and, of course, had to undergo the usual chaff
about hot pokers and branding, &o. He was
nervous and when the eventful evening arrived
was very much excited, and his friends, seeing
this, of course did little to calm him. Mandelson
was a very fussy old fellow, and most particular
about keeping his furniture in good order. Whilst
the candidate was being prepared Mandelson was
busy getting the lodge fixed up, and some clumsy
person upset a candle (there was no gas in those
days) and spilt a lot of grease on the seat of a
chair. The old man at once rushed out of the
room and called at the top of his voice to the
waiter downstairs ; “John, quick, bring up a hot
iron and some brown paper.” The candidate
heard this, visions of a speedy realisation of his
fears flashed before him, so he bolted out of the
tyler’s charge and disappeared, not waiting
to get back the small articles of which he had
been “ deprived,” nor did he even take his coat.
Nothing would ever persuade him that they did
not brand Masons, nor did he ever become one.

A good yarn of two dead Melbourne men
tells how Archbishop Goold was disappointed in
his hopes of inducing millionaire Tommy Monahan
to give freely of his substance to the one true
Church. Tommy’s extreme backwardness in
this respect was a matter of such painful
notoriety, that the prelate decided to attack him
in person, to which end he consulted with the
Monahan family confessor, and arranged to give
a little dinner at the palace in Tommy’s honour.
That wily old bird accepted the invitation, rolled
up for his free feed, and had put away a bottle of
the best before Dr. Goold broached the subject
nearest to his pious heart. The advantages
appertaining to the laying up of treasure in
Heaven were pointed out to Tommy with due
solemnity. “A man of your means,” said the
Archbishop, courteously pushing the decanter
along, “has it in his power to accomplish
a work that, whilst pleasing God, would
hand down his name to the admiration of
posterity. Provide the funds necessary for the
completion of St. Patrick’s Cathedral, and com-
mand the honour and gratitude of future genera-
tions ! ” The ungodly capitalist scratched his head,
and filled his glass slowly as his countenance
sickbed o’er with the pale cast of thought. “ And
about how much would it cost to com plate ? ” he
enquired. “ Fifty thousand pounds would do the
work handsomely,” says Goold. An awful pause
ensued. “ I’ll let you have it,” says Tommy, and
the Archbishop’s nervous hands congratulated one
another under the table. “Yes,” continued the
remorseless Thomas, “I’ll let you have it—at six
percent.” The meeting broke up shortly after-
wards, broke up entirely.
Which reminds us that several land-boom
“donations” to the St. Patrick’s building fund
have remained on paper up to the present day.

The Melbourne Charity Organisation
Society, having made an exhaustive examination
of the “unemployed” question, finds that “no
information has been placed before it which jus-
tifies the establishment of any special relief
organisation.” The men of charity cheerfully
admit the existence of unemployed, in large
numbers, but their neglect to answer circulars is
greatly against them. Also the Society considers
that there may be “ more real misery quietly and
uncomplainingly endured among clerks and shop-
men who are disengaged owing to dullness in
commercial circles than among any other class,”
although no satisfactory particulars on this point
have come under the secretary’s notice. Conse-
quently the Society regrets its inability to prepare
any reliable estimates of local distress and starva-
tion, but enjoys the smug satisfaction of believing
that for every hungry man out of work there is
another man even more hungry, wherefore it is
best assisting the cause of charity by standing
afar off and issuing pamphlets.

of a number, informs everybody within ten-feet

the fourth dimension of space, Joshua, revelation,
restoration, electro-chemistry, sesthenogen and
zoogen, einaigen, mind and matter, the solar

education of youth, Freetrade and Protection,
religion and politics, &c., to., illustrated by

And howls, because he can’t compete

“ The War-Atah ; an Australian Legend,’ 1
by Luden Henry, published by Neal, Paris, is a
romantic conception of the origin of that flower,
told in the guise of an aboriginal myth. The
language employed by the author is rich and
florid, and evinces a remarkable command, in a
French artist, of the resources of the English
tongue; while the story itself shows a wide range
of reading, a vividness of imaginative power and
an originality of treatment too frequently dis-
sociated from works depending for their interest
on themes selected from the folk-lore of savages.
The author illustrates his own volume with five
original designs, the reproductions of which, how-
ever, are not so fine as they might have been,
M. Henry is well known in Sydney as Art
Lecturer of the Sydney Technical College, and
is now in Europe preparing for the publication
of his great work on the Australian Decorative
Arts, a paper on which, by Mr. J. R. Tranthim- j
Fryer, was recently read by Lady Hamilton, at
Hobart, before the Australasian Association for
the Advancement of Science.
An Adelaide jury has found a verdict of
“ not guilty ” in the case of the proprietors of our
h vely contemporary Quiz, charged with libelling
Gerald and Duff, actors. Quiz stated that the
theatrical pair got up a benefit for the Broken
Hill fire brigade and “bolted with the proceeds
down to the last halfpenny.” As Gerald and
Duff did not, it would appear, bolt with any half-
penny save their own this looks a most
comprehensive and self-evident thing in the way
of libel—in fact, it would seem to any ordinary
intelligence that a defence in such a case was use-
less. Nevertheless the paper’s lawyer (a rising
youth named Piper) blandly asserted that
the words “bolted with the proceeds” were
absolutely innocent and harmless; he almost
implied that they were complimentary. Then he
claimed that there was a want of evidence to show
who were the owners of Quiz, and presently it
began to appear as if the paper simply walked
about loose with no owners at all. After that—
we here respectfully salute that lawyer-the jury
brought in a verdict of “not guilty” which either
means that the men whose names appear on the
paper and who take the money, if any, are in no
way responsible and can say what they like with
impunity, or else that it isn’t libellous to say
falsely that one man has bolted with another
man’s money. The points on which the defendants
relied, and on which, apparently, they got off,
remind us very much of the point on which another
man is alleged to have got off in New Caledonia
years ago. He was about to be guillotined, but at the
last moment he raised the objection that the basket
into which his head was to fall contained sawdust
instead of bran as provided by a custom having
the force of law. He was remanded that bran
might be obtained, but none was procurable, and
the authorities decided, after a week or so, that he
was entitled to bran and must have it. Then,
bran having arrived he was brought out again for
execution, but this time raised another point—
that having been ordered to be guillotined on a
certain day, and that day having passed, he
couldn’t be lawfully guillotined unless the same
day c uld be brought back again. This time he
got off altogether. Somehow the proprietors of
Qnz set us thinking of that man ; it is never hope-
less to take a law point.

SPORTING NOTIONS'
When the Irish team were training for the
Sydney Tug-of-War, the greatest difficulty experienced
was in obtaining opponents who could tax their powers to
«nv extent. First fifteen men were pitted against them,
hut they flew after the Irishers like chaff before the wind.
Then twenty-two were tried, but with little better suc-
cess and a trial of twenty-five only gave them trouble for
fifteen minutes. This was not considered good enough
to iret them into condition, so next night the end of the
roue behind the twenty-five was passed by their trainer
through a hole bored in the fence, and a couple of turns
taken round a post. For over an hour did the Irish team
perform, the rope being paid out to them an inch at a
time, when the twenty-five fresh men would make it good
again for the men at the post to take up the slack. The
best performance of the team, however, was with their
tongues when they heard about the post in the next yard.

Alluding to Mr. B. R. Wise’s departure for
England recently, a contemporary significantly says he
was the greatest mile-runner in the world. Now B.R.W.’s
victory over George in 1881 was creditable, but George
was off-colour at the time, and the year before or the year
after could have shown Wise a clean pair of heels. We
have now in Australia two men who were better than
Wise at the distance. These are Walter Slade, ex-
champion amateur, in a prosperous Melbourne business,
and Livingstone, at Newcastle, who in Scotland was
almost equal to “Wullie” Cummings. By the way,
Petley, the second swiftest sprinter ever seen at Sheffield
is somewhere about. What a show he in his best form
could have made of our Botany heroes—black and white !
# • •
Parks is the correct name of the Australian who
went home and met Nat Langhain, although he always
fought under the name of “Sparks.” The old man is
Btilfalive and lively, and the descendants of the brothers,
Tom and Bill Parks, are as plentiful as blackberries out
Hurstville and Canterbury (N.S.W.) way.
* # •
The pitting of Ironbark Burge against clever
Jack Hall is in the interests of neither boxing nor
humanity. It Hall is in anything like his old form the
fight will simply resolve itself into a test of the amount
of smashing Burge can endure before Hall falls weak or
breaks his hands. That Burge can beat Hall -ifhe is the
Hall of old—is too remote a chance to waste time in
discussing. Such a fight is sheer brutality and should be
stopped by the police.

English Boxer Baxter gave Australia a bad
name when he returned to England, and conveyed to his
interviewers an idea that Hades is not a circumstance
besides Australia for heat. Had he told the truth he
would have confessed that it was the boxers and not the
climate which he found too hot.

A weekly says a faro hell is carried on in a

the worst gambling games ever invented.
* * *
Jack Barnett, after many years of travelling
with, and abuse from, John L. Sullivan, has severed his
connection with the champion boozer. Barnett and Sul-
livan have never forgiven Australia for guying their show,

betted by Australia, notwithstanding the booming of
Australia as a land of sport.

“Toby Travers,” is a Kanaka “ with a dangerous right.”

The ball with which demon Spofforth took
either the batsman or the wicket in the historic seven-
runs-victory of Australia over All-England, in 1882, is
now the property of Mr. Gaspard Munro, enthusiastic
cricketer and amateur actor-vocalist, of Brisbane. Geo.
Palmer, when leaving the whisky-punching capital of
Purgatory, presented the trophy to a Mr. Nathan, who
afterwards gave it to its present owner.

In prize-ring etiquette the second’s spray-

One N.S.W, boxing god is now threatening to
“do for” certain pressmen who have shown up his
delinquencies. It was such conduct which brought about
the downfall of the old P.B. However, it must be
admitted that some pressmen deserve no better treat-
ment, considering the way in which their papers have
cringed to some of the meanest and most brutal ruffians
unhanged.

The death of a Melbourne sport gives a peg
for reminisoents to fetch up the Newmmster scandal.
This was an attempt to do Boucicault’s “ Flying Scud ”
business, and Wilson Barrett’s “Nowadays,” over the
nobbling of a certain Newminster, very hot goods in Mel-
bourne years ago. Dakin was the trainer, and frustrated
the hocus-pocus in a scene which Darrell ought to write
up—or Garnet Walch.

Dear Bulletin,— Recently you asserted that
“ a newspaper managed by a directorate for a company is
imerally cheap and nasty.” There's no doubt about it.
The “message” and “galley” boys on certain papers
down South are regularly “on the book” to “do” the
leading cricket-matches on Saturday afternoons, and the
copy they send in—well, it’s a treat for the comp.
Apropos, it will be interesting to learn if the galley-boys
aforesaid are eligible to membership of the recently-
formed Institute of Journalists.—Anti-Rats.

Percy M'Donnell’s “fad” used to be that
“ Lohmann was no bowler,” and that he “could knock
him out of the ground whenever he faced him.” Times
out of number did he come to grief in the old days whilst
attempting the performance, and Lohmann must have
chuckled on Saturday when M'Donnell was caught off
him, although not in an attempt to knock the ball out of
the field.
* * *
If the Sydney Amateur Gymnastic Club is
resurrected, it should define two classes of amateurs, as
in the rowing world -.—Bona-fide amateurs and manual-
labour amateurs. At present, all the amateurs - bar
George Seale—belong to the manual-labour class.
# # *
Valentine should now meet Partridge for the
manual labour amateur boxing championship. The
writer understands that Valentine refuses to meet Par-
tridge, on the ground that the latter has fought for a
money prize, but the objection does not imply that
Valentine is over-anxious to make a match, as the money
prize referred to was a couple of pounds, fought for in a
knuckle fight when Partridge w 7 as a mere lad. A meeting
between Valentine and Partridge at reasonable prices of
admission would draw an immense crowd.
» # •
If New South Wales is to hold its own on the
cricket-field a period must be put to the picking of worn-
out men, on the strength of past performances, to the
exclusion of young men of present performances. It is
to be hoped that the Sydney public have seen the last of
Mr. “ Sammy ” Jones as one of their representatives ; and
as to Percy M'Donnell, the picking of him for such a
match after a couple of years complete retirement, when
there are brilliant young cricketers only too eager for the
fray, is about the strongest argument yet adduced that
some radical change is required in the selection of the
selectors of N.S.W. representative teams.
* # *
Only a fair attendance patronised the meeting
of Valentine and Beckett for the amateur championship
at Sydney Amateur Gymnastic Club’s rooms on Monday
night, the scale of charges, £1 and 10s., being more suited
to a match between world’s champions than the pair
under notice, one of whom, Beckett, had never before per-
formed in public. Valentine scaled 10 stone 101 b., and
Beckett, a very powerfully built young man, 11 stone Bib.
The latter is a fighter of the whirlwind order, but his
rushing tactics availed not with Valentine, who knocked
him down in the third round with a body blow', and he
was counted out. Valentine had nob a scratch to show,
but Beckett had both eyes closed and was very badly
marked.

A N.S.W. surveyor tells a story of getting
rather “ happy ” in the bar of a country hostelry on the
night of a race-meeting which had killed one jockey—a
stranger in the town. The “survey” had drunk every-
body's health over and over, and when at last he was
going upstairs the housemaid said that as they were full
up, she was sure he wouldn’t .mind another gentleman
sharing his room with him ? “ Shertingly not,” amiably
hiccoughed the surveyor. “ Hope won’t disturb you, ole
feller,” to the “other gentleman,” who had already
turned in, and the elevated man of plans threw himself
beside the sleeper and went off at once. But voices woke
him in the morning. “ Where did they put the poor boy,
Liz ?” said one, and when the other voice said “ In here,”
the sobered surveyor reached out one trembling hand,
touched his stone-cold bed-fellow, and turned a double
somersault into the middle of the room. He had slept
peacefully cheek by jowl with the dead jockey.

Answers to Correspondents.
•R.B.’ (Sydney): Maori war-stones arc al
much the same. There is always the pakeha in them,
and the rangatira, or else the rangitoto, and the Ngati-
maniapotos and little things like that; hut there is no
humour in any of them, and we get tired of reading how
Hinemoa rushed after Titokovvaru, with Tokomairiro a
bad third.... ‘Errol Dene’: Too long. When you write
a bush story don’t start with the heroine's childhood in
England, and lug in the old cottage, and the bed with
the white dimity curtains, and the honeysuckle ; it’s all
quite superfluous ‘ Thoughts on the Inner Life ’: You
seem by your verses to be actually bad because there is
no perdition. Do you want it for yourself or for some-
body else? We'll lend you our office Gehenna if you like.
‘ II, Butler ’: Your mass of horrors and corpses is too
improbable.... ‘ W. Lewis’: You are a shrieksome poet,
and you keep on saying you are “forsaken,” without
mentioning once who forsook you..., ‘Charles Mutton’:
Your “ Essays of He - Liar ” firmly declined ..
‘Majuba’: What you call your “rambling statements”
are both unsuitable; they are rambling right enough,
but we have our doubts if they are statements ‘ 11.0.’;
You state correctly that your tale is “a la Hudyard
Kipling.” The only thing in it that is not a la Rudyard
Kipling is the gory adjective which you insert so fre-
quently'. ... ‘ Thistles ’: The man who supplies information
of that sort is out, and the present w'riter doesn’t know
“ Violet Fane ” or the other lady r either. Moreover, the two
ladies don’t know him, which is a much more serious loss.
‘ J. R. Tighe '; Nothing in it. One man who dies in the
bush is so very like any' other man who dies in the bush
that he isn’t worth publishing as a rule “A J.P.’
(Alberton); A groan, a dull thud, a spectre beckoning
you to follow to the spot w here its bones are lying—it is
too stale. We have over 100 such groans and thuds on
hand, all waiting for the authorities to call and take
them away'. Thuds are a drug in the market.... ‘ W.L.M.’
(Melbourne): Letter received with thanks.... ‘ Wan-
derer’: Your verse is simple and touching, especially
when you say :—
And I eased a lady of her purse ; O God I turned to go
The crowd to leave, the path was full, I was too slow.
You are also too slow' in a whole lot of other
things ‘Q.S.’ (S. Brisbane): The story of how you
“padded” tip to Joe Wilton’s place is just as thrilling as
the tale of how the cow' walked across the road —
‘J.B.I.’ (Melbourne); Received with thanks.... ‘ F.’:
An elegant and pleasing tragedy without any' visible
cause. It is a pity that an assassination which is calcu-
lated to take well and give pleasure to all should be
ruined for w'ant of a reasonable motive....‘Sydney’;
Your story amounts to this—you went to Michigan (U.S.)
and metapanther. If you read any manuscript to him, then
it was very rough on the panther ‘ D. A.’(Auckland);
The poet who states in his first verse that he is going to
drink all his life on account of a woman is never
much good. You can’t drink in verse, anyhow ...
‘ W. Amos ’: We understand that the syndicate which
has acquired the right of mining under Sy dney harbour
is to pay the Government a royalty of 6d. per ton on all
coal raised ‘E.R.’(H.): So far as we know', yes; but
we can guarantee none of them. It appears to be the best
of them all ‘Frank S.S.’: “For the Doctor” is
excellent in many respects. But it really might
have been written for the special edification of Mrs.
Gamp and an obstetric surgeon. Just look, for instance,
at the last four lines of the second verse. You must leave
more to the public imagination ‘A. Menson’; We
always feel deeply grateful to anyone who, living in an
out-of-the-way place, informs us of some reliable person
willing to take up a Bulletin’ agency ... ‘ J.M.A.’: There
are about forty French versions of “Obsession” —we mean
poemlets founded on your theme, which has been a
favourite one among the anti clerical romancists and
wits. The other day Figaro published a story developing
the idea.... ‘ Snooks ’: Thanks.... ‘ James B.’ (Peak):
Will look out for it... ‘R.H.W.’: Thanks for cutting
‘Quirk’; “All hail our bright and fertile land” damns
your alleged poem in one act. “All hail,” &c., isn’t in
our style. Try one of Fairfax's organs ... ‘ A.R.O.’; The
first step towards cheapening the costs of legal procedure
would be an arrangement whereby the courts should be
compelled to sit continuously instead of at problematic
intervals, and the various causes would be classified
according to their diverse characteristics ‘A. Kell’;
There have been no “lynchings”on Australian goldfields,
so far as we know. At the Pieman River they were going
to cut off the ears of a storekeeper w ho had prompted
the rush, and for a similar reason they chased Hunt out
of the Dunstan ; but up to date nobody has been killed...
‘ Sully Morgan ’: Your unwashed story of the boys who
hauled a frog out of a goburra with a string is unaccept-
able ‘Btiulinia’: Yes, he and “ThePard” are
identical. Your narrow squeak isn’t sufficiently lurid....
‘ L.G.’ (Bullock Creek): Write to Thos. Bracken, Empire
Hotel, Sydney ‘A. W. Berry’: The theme is too
utterly commonplace. Get hold of a strong original
episode and strike out for yourself.... ‘ Sphinx ’: The
subject has already been more effectively treated....
‘W.J.W.’: Thanks ; next week. .. ‘ Regina’(B.): Thanks
for clipping ‘M.C.H.’: Hope to print next week
‘ Amagyar ’; Write to the publisher whose name appears
on the American edition ‘John Bennett’: Petherick
and Co., Sydney, will no doubt be able to supply
you with a copy containing the verses in question
‘ A.S.’(Napier, M.L.): Declined ...‘O.D.’(Auburn, Vic.):
Received with thanks ‘H.C.C.’ (Melbourne): Par to
hand. Accept our gratitude ‘ J.M.’(Melb.); Lengthy
document which you forward to us consists, so far as we
can see, merely of unsupported statements taken at
second hand, and one of them isn’t even a statement,
but only something that is alleged to have been “im-
plied,” or that somebody “ was led to believe.” Our owm
sympathies are for the people who lost their all, and w r ent
to utter ruin through trusting certain men who were paid
to protect their interests, and who took their salaries and
let these interests slide in the most callous fashion....
* Yrrehs ’: We gave you an opinion of the “ Blazer Suit ”
—one that was much too violent to be read out in a ladies’
school. The other story is ruined by an impossible stage
Yankee. The American isn’t ahvays long and gaunt and
yellow, and his brother hasn’t always been “chawed by a
b’ar.” Many of them are short and fat, and never even
saw a “ b’ar. ” Also, they aren’t all supernatu rally “ cute, ”
some are quite stupid ‘ Student’(B.): The finest ex-
position, in small compass, of Federalism that we know is
Dr. J. M. Vincent’s “ State and Federal Government of
Switzerland.” Sydney price, 7s. 6d. Freeman’s “History
of Federal Government,” is the most philosophical by any
distinctively English writer, but only the first volume,
that dealing with the ancient Greek federations, was
published. The result of the American Civil War, it is
supposed, stopped the publication of the second volume,
by disproving the conclusions to which the author had
oome. Still, the fragment is magnificent. The greatest
works, however, on the federal principle are those of
Germans ‘ A.K.’(Melbourne): Ask any attendant of
Melbourne Public Library for the volume of Australian
pamphlets formerly labelled “328-6-17.” You will find
what you want there ‘ L.F.C.’ (Launceston): (1) Apart
altogether from the dirty Bryce business, Rusden is pro-
nounced by all authorities to be the most grossly biassed
Of all Australian historians—who include Wentworth and
Lang, and no one suspects them of impartiality; (2)
“When will the N.S.W. History from the Records be
completed?” Ask us ten years hence, please.... ‘ Nar-
ranghi Boori ’: The “ Brace of Sundowners” is the most
wonderful literary production we have ever read. There
is nothing like it in the Sydney Public Library, but it
won’t do for The Bulletin. ... ‘ Edw'ard Morley’; The
arguments you adduce in support of the woman’s-rights
position have been stated over and over again, and there
is absolutely nothing in them that will hold water. The
position of woman is a question of gradual development
and evolution. No amount of legislation in the world
will equalise the sexes. A woman is not a man, nor is a
man a woman, and things unlike cannot be compared. A
man and a woman are no more equivalent quantities than
half-a-mile and Is. Bd. The functions of a woman are
peculiar to herself, and no man can fulfil them. Neither
can the woman perform the work of the man. To say
that there are powers and capabilities which men and
women hold in common is to beg the question. The
differences arc real and marked, and cannot he bridged
over... ‘M. Morton Your humour belongs to the geo-
metric period when men were accustomed to smile by
means of an equation.

Read —‘ A Golden Shanty.’
The Q ueens l an d Aboriginal.
Dear Bulletin, —I have just read your
story “ Malchook’s Doom,” and taking out the
remorse, which characters of his sort seldom have,
and the visitation of retributive justice by the
blacks upon Jacky the Span, which seldom or
never happens, it very well describes the treat-
ment “ the niggers ” receive in Queensland. There
are few men bad enough, even if allowed by their
comrades, to go to the extent of burning a nigger
alive in the spinifex, though to shoot them at
sight is the usual thing in the outside parts. To
be true to nature, if everybody on the Nicholson
said that Jacky the Span deserved his fate, it is a
hundred to one it wasn’t because he killed blacks
they thought so. I venture to assert that they
would say that such a fate was deserving of the
man who spared them.
* * #
I have known a man have his life
threatened out Coen way for having informed a
camp of black men and women and children
located at a station that they were going to be
shot down in the morning at daylight, because
depredations had been done on the neighbouring
run and they were handiest for the native police
and run-holders to shoot. As it was, the owner
dismissed him. And the general all-round abuse
he got, and still gets, makes, him often ask him-
self if he is not a hangman or a murderer that his
fellow-men abuse him so. Nearly every native
police officer is a Jacky the Span, fox', to kidnap
boys and to make troopers of them and allow
them to kidnap gins from the bush, and then
shoot either troopers or gins if their love of
country or father or mother induces them to run
away from a slavery worse than death, is the
usual pastime of these gentlemen, intermixed with
kidnapping, shooting, frightening and catching
run-away boys for influential squatters. Do the
reverend gentlemen who waited upon N.S.W.
Premier Dibbs, the other day, with a request for
the xxative police of Queensland to be let loose on
the South Sea Islands know what they are asking
for ? If they do they are simply fiends in human
shape.
* # «
And for all this wickedness the Govern-
ment that is asking for moixey from the Austra-
lian provinces to carry on the same game in New
Guinea is alone responsible, for the squatter and
the black would never have come into antagonism
had the Government in renting new country pro-
vided that the blacks should get a periodical
supply of beef oi| mutton at their camps to supple-
ment their native foods for a few years until
settlement increased, when they could (with
their hunting) get enough work to maintain
them. This would not have been as expensive as
the native police for shooting them, and is not
like the missionary and reserve plans, which are
simply enslaving them, for they cannot bear to be
shifted from their own part of the country to
another or be changed from hunters into agricul-
turists. If worked in this way the black would
be an assistant to the squatter while his own
liberty would not be interfered with ; for as a
hunter and desti’oyer of marsupials he is a gain to
the squatter and the Government, and if he had
not been too much “dispersed” in the South, as
he is now being in the North, people need never
have feared a rabbit-invasion.
* * *
The above is the only practical and just
way of settling the black question. The black
does not covet the squatter’s grass ; the squatter
does not want the blacks’ game. The only tiling
to overcome is the black’s craving for beef or
mutton, which they will have while it runs about
like other game. In their wild state, they have
no idea of property in anything.
» # #
The blacks are now few. Let the Queens-
land Government disband its native police in
favour of white men only, and then bring (he
blacks at once under the same law as the white.
At or after the periodical distributions of be. f,
depredators can be arrested and sentenced to
terms of imprisonment in proportion to crime, for
it is well known it is the easiest thing to get the
truth out of blacks; and one will assist to arrest
or even shoot another without the least compunc-
tion, provided he is not a blood relation.
# # #
If the Australian blacks had been a
numerous and warlike race, they would have got
far more concessions than these for giving up so
beautiful a country. But while things are as they
are, Australians and Englishmen need not point
to the Spanish conquest of America for an
example of wanton cruelty.— Queenslander.
When Ollivier Pain disappeared in the
Soudan years ago the French Anglophobes said
he had been made away with by the English. Th<
truth is now disclosed. While being escorted
across the desert to the Mahdi’s head-quarters he
was taken ill and became so weak that he fell from
the back of his camel. The escort, to save trouble,
quietly buried him alive.
A Bathurst paper tells a picturesque story
of old Port Arthur, at the tune when padded
cells were introduced to prevent “ solitaries ”
from dashing out their brains against unpadded
walls, and which padding prevented the rats from
swarming in, as had been their wont, upon the
dark-cell occupant. Briefly put —Warder Dodds
playfully put into Convict M‘Pherson’s cell a
“Tasmanian devil,” a vicious tiger of an animal
well-toothed and strongly clawed, “as a bed-
mate tocaress and keep him warm.” M'Pherson,
at the expense of much blood and flesh, managed
to kill the fierce beast, and, when the matter was
reported, Dodds was reduced to his former con-
vict status —not for “brutality,” but for acting
contrary to the regulations in “ supplying a
prisoner with a companion to beguile his soli-
tude.”

OPINIONS OF THE PRESS
Proving the Wonderful Cures to be Genuine. (

menials will prove,"’ — Sydney Bulletin. t

Testimonials which he has received, certifying to important ,
cures effected hy his Remedies.” — Sydney Evening News. ;
“We have been shown some excellent Testimonials of the
great cures performed hy Herr Eassmussen, the Celebrated
Danish Herbalist. Herb Eassmussen is a gentleman who has
gained for himself a reputation in the medical world of herbal 1
science. He has been practising as a qualified herbalist so long in
Sydney that his name has become known throughout New South i
Wales and Australia.” — Australian Star.
“ We are continually receiving letters from Herr Rassmussen’s
Cured Patients, requesting us to make known the wonderful
virtues his world-renowned Herbal Remedies contain,”—
Sydney Weekly News.
“ Herb Eassmussen’s name has become a household word
throughout the Southern Hemisphere. He was presented with a
magnificent Gold Medal for some of his marvellous cures.”—
Balmain Leader.
“Herb Eassmussen is too well and vonrably known to the
Australian public to require any additional praise from ‘ Truth.
His Herbal Remedies are unequalled.”— Sydney Truth.
“ The remarkable Cures effected hy Herr Eassmussen’s Herbal
Remedies are pretty generally known.”— -Balmain Observer,
"Herr Eassmussen, we are glad to say, as a Medical Herbalist,
holds the highest place in the Colonies, and enjoys the confidence of
many of the leading people in N.S. Wales, Victoria,aud Queens-
land.”— Cooktown Courier, Queensland.

Freedom.
A REAL MAE OP STARE.
“ Herr Eassmussen’s Cures are so remarkable that we make no
apology for referring to some of them. Mr. Eamsden's case is the
most wonderful, and he cured him in six weeks, after all the
Sydney doctors gave him up. We may also state that a gentleman
in this district, who has been a martyr to the demon Dyspepsia for
more than two years, after trying several “ doctors ” with no
benefit whatever, is recovering under Herb Rassmussen’s Herbal
Treatment. In this age of unblushing quackery it is well to find
a man of Herr Eassmussen's undoubted skill, and we wish him a
Ion" life to continue bis useful mission in the cause of suffering
humanity.”— Kangaroo Valley Pioneer, NS.W.
A JUST REWARD.
Herb Eassmussen. of whose Famous Herbal Remedies everybody
has beird, is yet a young man, aud has held the position of Lecturer
to several Botanic Societies in Australia, he soon became known by
his wonderful cures of which he has numerous tokens of grateful-
ness, including a beautiful Gold Medal, brought him into the front
rank of Botanic Scientists ; now he is the Proprietor aud Discoverer
of the famous Denmark Herbal Remedies, all of which have
secured the honest support of the people, not only of Australia,
but Africa, the United States, the British Kingdom aud Italy.
It is not for us to enumerate the various remedies prepared by this
really learned man, but having seen aud examined letters from all
parts of the world, we are assured that be has saved a world of
sufferin'* n ,„d cured people of many complaints, after they had
given up all hope. ’’—The Australian Workman.— Sydney,

The Wild-Cat Column.
Tq-day there is hardly a newspaper in Australia
outside of such towns as Bendigo, Ballarat, Charters
Towers and Gympie with any appreciable real mining in-
fluence. The influence of the press has been lost in lying
or what is often worse—the suppression of truth. News-
papers—morning, evening and weekly—have been the
medium for the wheezes of the mining-bummer, the
phenomenal estimates of the low-level bounder founded
on assayers’ experiments, and manager’s periodical ex-
aggerations otherwise known as “ reports.”
# * •
For a time, when the boom swamped the news-
papers with prospectus-advertisements, nearly everything
sent in “went in"—until the mining correspondence
grew so prodigiously that it had to be “cut down”—a
work almost invariably entrusted to somebody who had
never seen a mine in his life.
* * #
To exemplify the density of the oblivion of
daily newspapers on the subject of mining, sometime
back a man perpetrated a joke on one of them
which has never yet been quite seen through.
He sent to it reports of what we will now call the
“Homeward Bound.” It had no real existence. For
the first three weeks it was a gold-mine, afterwards a
silver concern, and, in subsequent reports, the changes
were rung in turn on copper, tin, antimony and other
minerals. When the joke had been play'ed for a twelve-
month, and every report had been published with great
regularity and little condensation, the public were one
day soberly informed that all work had been abandoned,
as the coal-seam had disappeared. Every wild cat in
Australia has received columns of newspaper laudation of
its astounding richness in some form or other, and most
of the mines floated during the last few years were wild
cats.
# # #
At last, too, has arisen the newspaper mining
tipster, who has gratuitously made so many fortunes for
others, that we should not be surprised any day to hear
of his death by violence.
* # #
The average metropolitan mining newspaper
correspondent on the field is a daisy 7. Had his dictum
even a 10-per-cent, correctness there would be 50 mining
fields in N.S.W. alone with an average population of
50,000 each. He is sometimes a local editor, and often
the local bellringer.
* * *
Other mining heroes are the man with the new
patent for treating “ refractory ores,” the patent grind-
ing and amalgamating man, and the patent automatic
concentration genius. They have dealt with the man
who has lost his money under the blissful idea that “ the
battery lost his gold,” and now we propose to occasion-
ally deal with them. We shall interview the “mining
expert,” and subject him to occasional jibes concerning
the millions we were to get out of “ Taranganba,”
White Rock,” “Lewis Ponds,” “Toms,” “Castlerags,”
1 Last Galls,’ and other mines the public find it so easy
o remember.
# # #
Will the Broken Hill Proprietary mine collapse?
That is the question—never allowed to Crop prominently
ap, and dispelled In a thousand Ways whenever it
threatens—but it has, nevertheless, agitated the minds of
many substantial shareholders for a long time. If per-
fectly safe, why, then, so many assurances of safety after
every “creep?” Every other imaginable reason has
been given for the tremendous fall in the value of shares.
The drought, forsooth, when its returns and dividends
are uninterrupted, and the foregoing of one of the latter
would furnish a permanent water-supply, while the fall in
values represents £6,000,000. Why is it that no news-
paper ever stated that the fear is rapidly gaining ground
that the time must come, possibly this year, perhaps ten
rears hence, when the timbering must give way, where-
upon the yields would be long locked up, and the
American system of open square set timbering in a lode
iveraging some 60 feet thick will only stand to be ever-
lastingly 7 condemned. Unless you fill in a mine like the
Rroken Hill Proprietary it will one day fill itself in. The
11 creep ” in the mine is nothing compared to the “ creep”
Jut of it, hence the “ big fall ” in stocks.
* * #
An old hand, by adeptness and finesse, had
so raised himself in the estimation of his fellows that
be was regarded as an artist in salting a mine,
Having elevated it to the position of a fine art,
be very quietly 7 made it his profession. His ser-
vices Were retained by a party who had a some-
what difficult piece of “salting” to accomplish.
Having received his instructions and fee, he was, as
usual, of course, entrusted with a very heavy parcel of
jold—the wherewithal to sweeten the crushing and
the cake. The washing-off was a ghastly disappointment
to the intending purchasers, while the owners looked at
tach other and whistled. They interviewed the artist,
who instantly displayed all the diplomacy and tact for
which he was distinguished. He, in a tone of great
lignity, asked them if they really meant to impute that
be had been hired to manipulate a crushing and that
they had given him gold for so villainous a purpose.
Having condescendingly taken their names and addresses,
evidently with the object of an action for defamation, he
bade them an, revoir , and told them to go to h , The
gold weighed 6loz,
* * •
The death of mining companies and the incuba-
tion of new ones is now the order of the day. Share-
holders are informed that “ all the money has been called
up,” which often, in a capital of £lOO,OOO, means less
than £5OO. At Pambula there are companies with a
capital on paper of £60,000, and working capital of £2OO,
and no liability even for that,
» # #
New South Wales, above all other places in the
world, has been the home of the mining “mug.” The
slowness of the N.S.W. man’s nature, and his remem-
brance of the gruelling he received in 1871-2 by
the Hill End boom caused him to be the “last man in’’
the boom of 1889 —90. The last man in a boom usually
comes in to stay as a sort of wet-nurse liquidator to sick
and dying companies. In N.S.W. hundreds of thousands
of solid cash have been absolutely wasted inasmuch as it
has been spent on mines the ground of which should
never have been pegged out. Other hundreds of thou-
sands have been thrown away on machinery for which,
when completed, there was no use. Hundreds of thou-
sands, too, have been sunk in the sinking of shafts and the
driving of tunnels for lodes which, in many cases, had no
existence, and, when found in others, were worthless.
For years the cornstalks have been asses big enough to
believe every word sent in by mining managers. Now
they only believe in two or three expressive characteristic
phrases such os “ still sinking,” “ the pumps are working
well.” These are homely truths which carry their own
convictions.
* * #
Taranganba is dead, and now the Last Call is
rapidly dying. Both, as everybody knows, were “salted”
mines—nobody can be found bold enough to declare who
“ salted” either, although anybody could put his finger
on the persons concerned. Whoever heard of a conviction
for “salting?’’ Nevertheless, a very large percentage of
mines floated in a boom are more or less “salted." The
successful “sailer” always escapes, and usually with a
fortune, while the unsuccessful “salter,” the man who is
detected, pays the small penalty of not being able to sell
his mine. We will allow till the end of the present cen-
tury, and give odds, that the persons who “salted” the
Last Call mine will never be gaoled.
# # *
What earthly use, from the standpoint of the
general community, is the Prospecting Vote? Hundreds
of thousands of pounds have been wasted by this means
by the Australasian Governments. Judged by results, it
stands condemned. It engenders fraud, extravagance,
State robbery and jobbery. What is wanted in its stead
is the institution of a State Mining College, with extensive
metallurgical works for the treatment of test lots of
every class of ore at a small cost. Erected in the metro-
politan districts and well conducted, such institutions
would command the attention of students, and open up a
new profession to the Australian youth. It could be made
self-supporting when well established. Large premiums
from students could be readily obtained. To send big
consignments of concentrated ores to Freiburg, an inland
town in Germany, for treatment is a costly anomaly. It
is because 6f the absence of such works that Australian
mines, in which hundreds of thousands have been
expended, remain idle to-day—£loo,ooo spent in this
direction would mean the money saved in others. The
Bulletin means to push this question ahead.
The wild cat mines of New South Wales are
being weeded out by liquidation. The bracketed words
(in liquidation) haunt almost every legal manager’s office
plate. In some places it is squeezed into a corner; in
others it stands boldly out as if the contingency had been
well in mind when the plate was originally designed.
The liquidator is a soulless man, who sees nothing but the
liabilities of the company, and sells for what it fetches
everything on which he can lay his hands at a time, of
course, when few want to buy. Batteries, engines,
boilers, smelting works, concentrators, and every other
form of mining machinery, on which, in some cases, many
thousands have been spent, are sold for fewer hundreds.
A limited liquidated mining-plant syndicate, to buy up
these sacrifices, would undoubtedly declare big dividends
in the next mining boom.
# * #
Fortunately for British investors, the Broken
Hill and Mount Morgan mines were not floated in Eng-
land. Had they been their results would have poured
ten of millions of English money into Australian wild-
cats. The British investor only wants a few dividend-
paying mines to make an ass of himself. He did so in
the Transvaal, and will do so anywhere. It is an axiom
that the conditions surrounding the floating of mines in
London are such as to render profitable raining almost
impossible. A gold or silver mine in any part of the civi-
lised world always commands its apparent intrinsic value
locally. If taken to London, be it big or small, it must by
the traditions of the brokers, promoters, financiers,
underwriters, provisional directors, and other sharks, be
so loaded as to render dividends out of the property only
possible by striking something phenomenally richer than
was ever anticipated. It is the man and not the mine
that floats in London- hence, as a rule, the man gets hold
of a worthless mine and is quite prepared to exchange his
little reputation for big money.
* * #
Four shareholders in a claim wanted to “get out,”
each determined, unknown to the others, to “salt"the
crushing and thereby boom the shares. Each, unknown
to the others, put into the box a quantity of gold, and all
were surprised at the size of the cake. Each started at
arithmetic deducting the amount which he alone sub-
scribed, and all came to the conclusion that the crushing
was an astonishingly good one, and that dividends were
certainties. Each rushed away and bought shares heavily',
and all at last discovered that they had “had” each
other. This is the only case on record where salters
were, by their own hands, salted. Let us hope it cured
them.
Captain’Osborne, who married the heroine
of the pearl-robbery case whilst her character was
already under suspicion, has received something
to console him for the disgrace of his adventurous
wife. The Duke of Gampridge declined to accept
his military resignation, on the ground that
“Her Majesty cannot afford to part with the
finest representative of chivalry of the century.”
The Duke’s limited conception of chivalry is
easily accounted for, by the way. As the husband
of an ex-dancer whose “maiden” name was not
unspotted before the world he naturally likes to
think that a man who makes an imprudent
marriage is necessarily the beau-ideal of a noble
animal.
A certain Australian M.P. lately had some
transactions with a “financier,” and when one of
his p.n.’s fell due he wanted it renewed. The
financier agreed to do it, “if he provided two
good names.” The M.P. hurried to the Assembly
and without the slightest trouble procured the
signatures of two prominent politicians. “ Here
you are,” he said to the financier, “will these
do?” “ Gott in Hirnmel, no,” exclaimed the
Hebrew When he saw them ; “ I’ve got a mort-
gage oVer eferything dey possess—barring their
souls ! ” Apropos, the schedule of Abraham Fried-
man shows that only 18 members of the N.S.W.
Assembly—in other words, about 13 per cent,
of the total members —owe him money. The
amounts range from <£3ooo down to =£4o.
G. R. Sims tells a yarn that has a moral
not only for successful litterateurs , but more
particularly for men who fancy themselves much
bigger roosters in much smaller spheres. “ Dago-
net’s ” yarn is to the effect that at a time whert
his name was on the bills of four London theatres,
he joined a party of old fellow students in a
private box at a theatre, and sat out one of his
own dramas. Over a little supper, after the
performance, he had to listen patiently whilst the
play was voted blank “rot,” after which he
gathered up his hat and slunk sorrowfully away.
“ These were men of the world, and went about
town,” remarks Sims, “but not one of them had
ever heard of me in connection with the theatre;
and, although they took a programme as they
went into the box, not one of them studied it
sufficiently to notice my- name upon it.” The
vanity of “fame” is soon understood by a man
who ventures outside his own circle. Only the
prosperous pompous tradesmen, who sticks strictly
to the town which elected him councillor, has the
satisfaction of living and dying truly famous to
the best of his belief.
There is a silver lining to every cloud.
During the Sydney Savings Bank scare, when
several hundred people were screaming in the
street because the door of the bank was too
narrow to let them in, at least one gentle Hebrew
did a good trade by buying up depositors’ books
at the rate of 15s. in the £. He Went home that
night with quite a little pile, and came back the
second day to pursue his avocation. By this time
the crowd had so much diminished that there was
no earthly reason why the people shouldn’t go in
and receive payment in full, yet in quite an
unaccountable way he was fairly rushed by sellers.
He bought at 25 per cent, discount till his loose
cash was all exhausted, and then ho went into the
bank to settle up his accounts and—so the story
goes—found that he was left. Another son of
Israel had also been buying up deposits cheap,
and making fresh entries in the books on his own
account, and selling them to him by various agents,
and he was the worst-defrauded Hebrew that ever
came out of Palestine. Next time there is a run on
the Sydney Savings Bank a different “financier”
will be buying up credit balances in the gutter at
Barrack-street; the present one h.as retired from
the trade. He says that the Australian depositor
is “ too unbrinzibled,”
Dear Bulletin, — Your interviewer un-
earthed a fine old liar at Liverpool (N.S.W.)
Benevolent Asylum. There was a man named
Gibson lost during Giles’ expedition of 1873, but
there is no manner of doubt about his death. The
asylum hero, according to his account, found his
way home on foot accompanied by a retriever slut
from the interior of Western Australia. Passing
over the wonderful sporting abilities of the dog as
simply a Munchausen effect thrown in, let us see
to the remainder. He lived on mussels and
’possums in a portion of Australia where there are
neither ’possums nor mussels ; he had a retriever
slut with him, which is a canine that will stand
neither heat nor thirst, and could never have
reached the point indicated alive. This slut
caughtfish, in acountry where there are no fish, and
a lot of other absurdities too numerous to mention.
The water supply of thq region where the real
Gibson perished simply consists of occasional
oozing springs, with a few rock holes filled by
passing thunderstorms. Permanent waterholes
are unknown, and in the dry spinifex country
there is no life but that of ants ; not even a kite is
visible. No white man ever found his way in on
foot from that region. Our friend G.G. must
have been sitting at the feet of Jack Dick
Skuthorpe.— Delcomtn.

CONSULTATION FREAK,
Impudence Personified.
In the Field of January 26, we sounded a
warning note to the public relative to a consulta-
tion promoted under the heading of the Sydney
Jockey Turf Club, and we are pleased to find that
our article has had a good effect in many country
districts. This week it becomes our duty to call
the attention of the public to a consultation
promoted by a person calling himself G. Adams,
and who gives his address as Box 591, G.P.0.,
Sydney, and by many this person is confounded
with Mr. George Adams, of Tattersall’s Hotel,
and who is the promoter of
tattersall’s monster consultations,
so well and favourably known throughout the
colonies. From information to hand we find that
some time back a man employed in one of the
ferry services of the harbour "discarded his own
name and caused circulars to be issued under the
name of J. Adams, setting forth particulars of a
monster consultation, his address at this time
being Darling-street, Balmain, but this was care-
fully kept back from the public, and the address
given as the G.P.O. The public, ever ready to
Speculate, patronised the affair in great style, and
in a few months “J. Adams,” in addition to his
position on the ferry steamer, found himself very
well provided for as regards funds. Yet, like
many others, the “ferry man’’did not think the
money was coming in fast enough, and he there-
fore caused more circulars to be issued in the
name of “ G. Adams,” and one of these precious
documents is lying before us as we write. The
public fell into the trap, and for months money
rolled in from all'parts of Australia, and it was
some months before the authorities were made
aware of the deception. Then an order was issued
stopping the payment of
POST-OFFICE ORDERS
which were made payable to the so-called “G.
Adams,” and it may be mentioned that the proper
name of the latter was then made known to the
powers that be, when it was found that he held a
certificate under the Marine Board in connection
with ocean service under quite another name.
When the promoter found which way the wind
was blowing he betook himself to a leading bank
and paid into his credit a number of cheques and
Post-office orders, thinking no doubt to get the
latter cashed through this channel, but the G.P.O.
people still stood firm, and the result was that the
manager of the bank referred to, demanded an
immediate withdrawal of the account. Not to be
outdone, this self-called
G. ADAMS
wrote to three of his clients, who had forwarded
to him £2), in sums of .£lO, £7 and £3, stating
that for some unexplained reason the Post-office
authorities declined to cash P.O. orders made
payable to sweep promoters .and asked them to
withdraw their order from their local Post-office,
and forward him a cheque or cash for the amount,
charging him (the promoter), of course, with “all
expenses.” The local Postmaster, however, could
not interfere, and the result was a communication
with head-quarters; and the final was reached
when the authorities detained some scores of there
r rders; and at the present time there can be
found a great number lying in the Money Order
Office, unpaid and unclaimed, the latter being
caused by tire G. Adams, of Box 591, G.P.0., not
being forthcoming. Since the present
POSTMASTER-GENERAL
came into office the right of G. Adams to use Box
691, G.P.0., has been withdrawn, and this in-
dividual has been put to considerable trouble
thereby. Nothing daunted, however, the man of
“fertile brains” issued other circulars, one of
which came from Victoria to us a few days ago,
and is headed as follows :
Adams’
Moxster Cash Prize Consultation
on the
Newmarket Handicap.
And this document sets forth that the event ia
open to 100,000 subscribers at 10s. each, and,
according to particulars on the back, every sub-
scriber of .£1 has fourteen separate chances of
drawing two horses or twelve cash prizes. We
commend this portion of the business to our
readers, and leave them to judge for themselves of
the result. But the most interesting part of this
circular is contained in the following paragraph :
As Consultations
are Illegal,
and the authorities trying to stop them, please send
Gold, Notes or Cheques in payment for Tickets, Instead
or Post Office Orders.
Now, for real cool cheek this paragraph takes
the cake, as, having failed to get the authorities to
with him in the name of a respected
citizen, the promotor has the impudence to try and
coax his clients to do business as above. As
showing the immense business done by this man
and others of the same ilk, we may say that during
the past week over 300 registered letters have been
received by this “G. Adams and as showing his
impudence, we can state that a few days ago a man
came direct from him to the G.P.O. to claim these
very letters, which, for various reasons, had been
withheld for a few days. During the past few
weeks something has happened to disturb this
unknown sweep promotor’s peace of mind, as he
changed his place of residence in a very hurried
manner, and his whereabouts just now is a matter
of doubt. We trust that we have now given the
public sufficient warning, and have also to inform
them that in all probability fac-similos of the
genuine Tattersall’s circulars will be issued to
them within a few days, and they should there-
fore be upon their guard and see that the proper
address is placed thereon. Fortunately for some
of the up-country folks, their moneys have found
their way into the hands of “ Tattersalls ” instead
of into the hands of the so-called G. Adams of
Box 591 G.P.O. We have omitted to mention
that in December last a client wrote to this Box
591 man, asking to be supplied with the name of
the person who drew the big prize in the Mel-
bourne Cup, and the man of “mystery” actually
had the effrontery to send one of “Tattersall’s”
printed slips with the name thereon, but was very
careful to cut off the name of “ Tattersall.” Need
we say more.— Vide the Field, Feb. 9th, 1892;

WHAT EVERYBODY SHOULD KNOW.
Sprains are injuries done to the ligament
tendons, and other structures surrounding the
joints. They are produced by jumping, falling
lifting heavy weights, or other causes, which
forcibly stretch or lacerate the tendons, &c. The
joints most liable to sprains are the wrist and
ankle joints. The latter are more frequently
sprained by persons in the act of jumping or
running or by the foot turning under the weight
of the body, while the wrist may be sprained in a
fall, or by handling heavy objects, and so on.
Injuries of this kind are of the most common
occurrence, and everyone should know how to best
treat them. Sprains are attended with great pain
at the time of the accident, and also with consider-
able swelling and discoloration of the injured
part; the swelling and discoloration arise from the
effusion of blood into the surrounding structures.
In the treatment of sprains the injured limb must
be kept in a perfect state of quietude, and in such
a position as to relax the muscles in connection
with the affected tendons, as well as to favor the
return of the blood to the heart. The bowels
should be kept in a free state, and hot fomentations
applied to the sprain by means of a sponge or
piece of thick flannel. Next, dry gently with a
soft Turkish towel, and immediately after apply
St. Jacobs Oil, which should be rubbed as the
patient may be able to bear, over and around the
part affected, with the palm of the hand ; then
bandage tightly with strips of old linen, saturated
in the same liniment, and let the operation be
repeated at intervals until a cure is effected. By
this treatment the disease will rapidly subside,
and the affected part will return to its usual
healthy condition. This was the experience of
Mr. James Grant, of No. 2, Kent-street, Sydney,
who writes : “ I formerly worked on the Margaret-
street Wharf, and while there the sinews of my
forearm gave way, and I was unable to lift any-
thing, and so prevented from following my employ-
ment. I was advised to try St. Jacobs Oil, and
did so with good effect, as my arms are now quite
strong, and I can carry heavy weights without
feeling anything of my former complaint.” Cut
this out and paste it in your scrap-book.

HOW TO IMPROVE YOUR FORTUNE.
If you are not up to time in all your engage-
ments, small as well as great, people soon begin to
lose confidence in you. A trifling sum invested
in a Waterbury Watch will help to save you froth
being frequently misjudged, and may be the meahs
of materially improving your fortunes. It is th 6
very trifles of life on which success or failure
generally hinge. And if anything goes wrong
with the watch the owner has only to take or send
it to the offices of the Waterbury Watch
Company, at 56, Margaret-street, where it can
be repaired at a cost according to its requirements,
but in no case exceeding 2s. 6d., unless by mutual
consent. The cost of transmission by post or
parcel delivery on watches sent from the country
must be prepaid, and a sufficient amount to cover
return charges and cost of repairs forwarded at the
same time. If sent in the box in which the
Waterbury is sold the postage fee (including
registration) is 6d. each way.

No. II.—Captain Maconochie’s "Bounty for
Crime.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The most remarkable experiment, all
things considered, ever made with the noble pur-
pose of reforming criminals was Captain Macono-
chie’s attempt to adapt his “ mark ” system to the
monstrous conditions of penal life at Norfolk
Island. And being in principle humane, and in
method an arraignment of all notions current in
British and Colonial officialdom, it met with pre-
cisely that degree of success which was prophesied
for it by Mr.—not then “ Sir ”—B. Deas-Thomson,
Colonial Secretary of New South Wales.
“Speaking, your Excellency,” said that vener-
able if somewhat pragmatical gentleman to Gover-
nor Sir George Gipps, “ from a lengthened
experience of—h’m—convict disciplinary methods,
I have—ah !—no hope that Captain Maoonochie’s
system will achieve the least good. It must fail,
sir !”
And fail it did. To the undisguised delight of
the Colonial Secretary’s Office, Sydney, and the
Deputy Commissariat-General’s Departments of
Sydney and Norfolk Island, it failed. You see,
the first maxim of the Captain was the reforma-
tion of the criminal, while almost every other
person connected with the System, from Lord
John Russell to the meanest scourger on the
Island or at Port Arthur, thought the criminal
was a mere thing to be locked up, and fettered,
and flogged into purity of life and integrity of
conduct.
Now, Maconochie’s success would have meant
the System’s condemnation. And his failure
meant that the System was right and its adminis-
trators were wise. Therefore the failure was only
to be expected. Men do not care about being
proved' wrong, even if it could be shown that a
few dozen souls were saved in the process of
correction.
For instance, Mr. Assistant-Deputy-Commis-
sary-General Shanks would have had to confess
himself egregiously in error had Convict Tobias
Tracey, per ship John, third trip, kept continu-
ously on the path of rectitude which Captain
Maconochie marked out for him.
And that was not to be thought of. Convict
Tracey had to fall once mor» in the slough of ill-
doing in order to prove A D. O. G. Shanks
right.
• * #
To enable you to understand how terrible
was that fall we must measure the height which he
had attained. Step by step, climbing upwards,
now taking firm foothold on a dead sin, now
clutching such aid as came from the opportunity
to do a kindly service to a brother-felon ; again
slipping back into the pit of corruption because
a messmate jeered at him ; yet again striving
against the tremendous alliance of the forces of
evil, till he gained a new standing-place on the up-
track— of Tracey during
1840, and the early part of 1841. In the
later part of ’4l he fell—thanks to A. D. C. G.
Shanks—irretrievably. In the early months of
’4l, he had first come under the notice of the Cap-
tain-Superintendent, and had begun to aspire
towards a manlier existence. During the interval
between those first tentative stragglings to mount,
and that last dreadful fall, his life was epic in its
storms and its battles, its victories and its defeats,
* # #
Look at his record.
His original conviction was on the Bth Septem-
ber, 1831, at a London gaol delivery. His crime
was burglary, and his sentence, transportation for
life.
His sojourn in the hulk obtained for him the
distinction of “a bad report,” and the voyage out
to Sydney gave him still higher rank in the aristo-
cracy of vice. “He was doomed,” the Surgeon-
Superintendent of the John (third trip) told him
one day in mid-ocean, “to become a Black Nor-
folker as sure as Fate.”
And Fate is unerring, as everyone knows. Two
years after landing in Sydney, he was sentenced
by the Supreme Court for highway robbery and
housebreaking. Once more his time was life, with
the added distinction of irons—irons always—
sleeping, waking, at work and at his meals—irons
to be knocked off only if he mounted the scaffold,
or on freedom coming to him otherway—say,
through some kindly shot or kindlier blow. Free-
dom by process of servitude would never come to
him. He was destined by Nature as a Retrograde.
Chaplain Taylor spoke of his “Retrogrades ” to
Governor Gipps.
“Your ‘ Retrogrades ? ’ What are they ? ”
“ Men who are further away from freedom each
succeeding day they are on the Island—who are
never nearer freedom than when they set foot
here ! ”
“But, Mr. Taylor, in the nature of the case
such characters must be few?” rejoined His Excel-
lency.
“Few, Your Excellency? Sixty out of each
hundred!”
Now, at the precise moment the Superintendent’s
clerk at the Island gave a receipt to the master
of the Governor Phillip, from Sydney, for the
body of Tobias Tracey, No. 33,149, per John (3),
that hardened villain might have expected release
in 25 years, if the Devil and the System would
only allow him to keep his hands from picking
and stealing, and breaking-in stores and warders’
heads. Being predestined, however, to the ranks
of the Retrogrades, within 24 hours of his arrival
he was no nearer than 30 years to his freedom.
He had knocked a gaol-turnkey down.
# # • ,
In 1835, his “ police history” was extended
by five offences of the serious order. “Light
offences ” were invariably at this period and till
the arrival of Maconochie, sentenced “on view.”
“On view ” punishments—that is, without trial—
are supposed to have numbered, during 1833-4-5-6-
7-8, between 8000 and 9000. They were never
recorded; formal trials only were recorded ; and
these last during the years specified totalled 2483,
and the awful mutiny year calendar was embraced
in this sum. Of these trials Tracey was respon-
sible, in 1835, for five.
In 1836 he was credited with four. The cir-
cumstance that he was ironed in gaol for the
major part of this year accounted for the diminu-
tion of 20 per cent, in the number of his heavy
offences. When a felon was double-ironed in a
6x4 cell, when his right hand was manacled to a
staple in the wall, when he saw a human face four
times daily for ten seconds each time, it cannot be
said that his opportunities for outraging the peace
of the realm were numerous. Still, ho enlarged
his record by four entries.
In 1837 they varied his gaol privileges by
flogging him, and the scourging ground was the
best place possible for adorning a man’s record.
He had only to swear at the superintending officer
to be credited with another crime ; and if, also, he
struck the honourable scourger with his fist or
head, or bestowed upon that official a sadly-
needed kick, well, there was a second offence on
the same day. Consequently, Mr. Tracey, who
was in gaol from January to 7th March, was in
gaol again from 3rd April “till further orders.”
In June and July he was in gaol, but in Septem-
ber he must have been out of gaol, for he
absconded. He was arrested three-quarters of an
hour afterwards at the gate of the Superinten-
dent’s quarters —said he had never been out of the
gaol precincts—-nevertheless, was presented with
300 lashes in one dose. And from 14th October
onwards to the end of the year he was in gaol
again, his record for the year being seven crimes.
In 1838, a variation in policy took place once
more. He added no more than five offences to his
history, but one of these earned him 100 lashes
and another four months in the sweet seclusion of
his iron-cells—and the others ? Each won for him
a long term of “solitary.”
The second Earl of Limerick, then plain Mr.
Pery, and a humble “Superintendent of Agricul-
ture ” on the island, spent a brief space in one of
the same solitary cells. He stayed till it was a
question of his going mad, or going out. He went
out, and found that he had been secluded 17
minutes ! Tracey had three terms—14, 14, and 20.
Minutes? No—days!
As for Tracey’s 1839 record, here it is as full as
the books give it. There are no “ sentences on
view ” included, and he must have had his full
share of them. You will not fail to notice the
dreadfully heinous character of the recorded
crimes.
At the end of 1839, with a double-life con-
viction over him, Tobias was exactly 53 years
distant from freedom. But in February of the
succeeding year Captain Maconochie arrived,
and, to the amazement of the well-informed
officers of the System as before established, almost
immediately chose that prime rascal by the John
(3) for special experiment. As soon as the new
Super, was possessed of Tobias Tracey’s police
record, he.ordered the man’s irons to be struck off.
Now, Major Bunbury, the previous commandant,
had never dared approach Tobias except under
the escort of two soldiers.
But the amazement of the staff was nothing to
the surprise of the notorious fellow himself.
“Lord ! What a fool the new ’un is if he thinks
as he’s got a softy to deal wi’.” Thus he laughed
with a coarse mockery, as he passed into the
Super’s, presence.
The Superintendent’s tall and erect form filled
the doorway of the Gi’ass Hut where he was hold-
ing a preliminary inspection. In a few weeks he
would turn the hut into a school and a Catholic
chapel, but at present he proposed to use it as a
court-house. “Why?” The old officials asked
the question—and cackled hilariously when they
received the answer. Sothat prisonersfor trial, who
might have been in the local court before, might
not be unpleasantly reminded of their past mis-
deeds ! “I want to start every man with a clean
sheet as far as possible.” Laugh! Of course they
laughed.
The Overseer in temporary charge of Convict
Tracey saluted, and presented that ruffian.
“ Transport Tracey, Tobias. No. 33—149, y’r
Honor —bad k’racter —3 B’s, f sir—suspected ”
“ Of unnatural crimes—one murder—three bur-
glaries—an’ a heap to’ther things, Super.—same
ol’ list,” concluded the convict himself. “ One o’
th’ worst men on th’ Island, y’r Honor, now
they’ve turned orf Westwood. There ain’t a
crime on the list, Super., that I ain’t committed,
’cept those I’m goin’ to commit. An’ now yer
know all, ol’ cove ! Give us my five hunderd
quick ah’ ’a done wi’ it. Look slippy now, Ol’
King-o’-th’-lags ! ”
Accustomed as the penal officials comprising
Captain Maeonochie’s little suite were to outbursts
of reckless speech from the more hardened “ old
hands,”! they scarcely expected Tracey to uncoil
*For the purposes of these stories the epoch of the
“Early Days” is presumed to end with the cessation of
transportation to Western Australia.
■f “Three B’s”—Trebly bad record.
J “Old band”—At Norfolk Island this term had a
different application to that given to it on the Continent
in later days. It signified a “doubly-convicted” con-
vict—anrisoner with both a BritishandaColonial sentence.

himself in this fashion, and they gazed curiously
at Maconochie to note the effect of the speech
upon him. _ _
Two—three minutes elapsed before the Superin-
tendent spoke. Tracey himself had expected an
instant order for his removal to the triangles, and
stood doggedly waiting for the command—which
did not come.
All they saw was that Maconochie drew his
handkerchief from his tail-pocket and blew his
nose. Then—
“ Let it be understood, Overseer—are you Over-
seer or Warder ? ”
“ Overseer, sir—of the gaol-gang—Tuff, sir.”
“ Very well, Overseer Tuff—let it be understood,
if you please, that you are never to report a man’s
police-history till it is asked for by me directly,”
“ Yes, sir ! ” answered the sub-official, with a
sullen respectfulness, “But ’twas the Major’s
reg’lashun, sir, wi’ all transports, ’specially des-
p’rate ones ! ”
“ Ho, ho ! I be a desp’rate one, be I, Mr. Tuff?”
grinned the transport. “Well, I know I be—an’
’ere’s to keep up th’ k’racter.” With a mighty
cuff he struck Tuff to the ground. “ There Super,
Mac-wot’s-yer-name, give me my five-hunderd
lashes, an’ ’a done wi’ it, as I said a-fore ! ”
The ex-private secretary to noble Sir John
Franklin answered the appeal. He stepped into
the school-room, and called to the transport to
follow him. Some of the officials who had looked
on the incident just described would have entered
likewise, but the Captain quietly waved them
ii r i i
I would prefer to be alone with this poor
fellow, gentlemen. Excuse me for a few minutes,”
“ e .f ai °; .... , . _
But, sir—the danger . remonstrated A. D.
. ,
I he Captain srmled not as, a few years later,
John Brice was wont to smile, with a lofty affecta-
tion of indifference to any possible danger that
could threaten him but pleasantly, as though he
held an amulet bestowed by some good genius
against evil. , .
Captain Maconochie might be a crankbut,
certainly, he was no coward.
* * *
As he walked in, Tracey had, obeying the
mechanical instinct which, in spite of himself, the
System had implanted in his nature, took his cap
off, Then he recalled the act. He was not going
to submit as “ a softy ” to the new super. Not he.
He replaced the cap defiantly as he faced the
Captain. However, the Superintendent gave no
indication that he was aware of the insult. Bun-
bury would have chained Tracey down for the
Sa, (V?r oe ”‘ i» -j nr i- (, T ■ . . .
“My man !” said Maconochie. I wish to have
a talk with you •
I don t want to talk to yer . Come on an flog
me or p r aps ye d like to do th nubblmg cheat§
trick at once ? Better now than ater. I’m boun’
to come to it! responded the callous wretch.
Look, sir Maconochie paused. Till harassed
by the incessant opposition of the old-time officials,
Maconochie measured almost word he
uttered in a transport s presence. Constant
dropping of water wears away a stone. The
habitual use of forms of respect to any even the
most hardened-prisoner will insensibly by wear-
ing away the indurated surface, give his better
nature room for play.” That was what he used
, . „

II hat. Lifer Tracey could not believe his
ears, “Sir! Wot a joke! Me with an Gn-
corrigible’record—sir!”
“Look, sir—” Maconochie began again.
“None o’ that foolin’. Yer not a-goin’ to make
a softy o’ me, 1 tell yer !” Tracey raised his hand
threateningly, as though in defence of that precious
possession—his reputation for eminence in evil,
“ I be’nt no parson’s or Super.’s pet!”
“I am sure of it,” rejoined the Captain. “But
you are a man, and not a devil—l am sure of that
as well!”
A second of wits’-gathering silence. Then
“ No, I be’n’t no man- a devil I am, or th’
Systuui hasn’t done its work !” He laughed, with
the reckless, sardonic laughter of the hopeless,
“No, you are a man, and no devil! And
because you are a man, obey one of the first
instincts of manhood, and that is to behave with
respect to your just and legal superiors.”
“ Just—legal!” Again the laugh—and then a
storm of mad, tumultuous speech. “ Just is them
wot justice do—legal is as legal act ! Be’n’t truth
’bove all things ? Cana man be a man if he’s a
liar? Be’n’t a liar alius a coward? An’ no
coward’s a man ? An’ ’udn’t I lie ef I paid respec’
w’ere respec’be’n’t doo? An’ is respec’ doo to
nnybody unner th’ Systum, for wot cove is there
unner th’ Systnm as acts justly, as acts legally ?
Answer me that, 01’ Kmg-o’-th’-lags !”
“ Poor man, poor man !” exclaimed Maconochie,
and p ac i n g forward, he held out his hand. Tracey
struck it aside passionately
' “Yer’ve left ‘ me nothin’ but-oh, nothin’,
nothin’but hate—an’now yer give me your pity.
To the devil who made yer an’ th’ Systum ! ” He
leapt tigrishly on the Superintendent—and was
felled by a blow. There was nothing effeminate
about Maconochie’s muscles or his nerves, if there
rwasjusta suspicion of that quality attached to
his judgment. No. 33-149 went down, and for a
minute stayed down, dazed.
No word was spoken till Tracey, with eye-balla
glaring redly instead of whitely, drew himself up
t 0 a sitting posture.
“Didn’t!—say as the nubblin’cheat’ud end it
soon ? B y th’ Lord, sir, I thank yer !”
Maconochie had faced a mutiny from a quarter-
deck ; had, as a lad, confronted, with only a toy-
dirk in hand, a howling circle of barbaric moan-
tam tribesmen thirsty for his blood ; and yet he
was wont to say, never did human look appal him
as ffiat transport s glare of gratitude,
( H s death—this—you know, my man.
, Death— tis—an welcome . It was a hyaena
s h rie k made articulate.
* * *
My friend, let me help you up !” Again
Captain Maconochie stretched forth his hand.
Tracey looked up. “ D’yer mean it ?” The
softening of the words passed in the next instant
f rom } ds f ace and tone. “ Mean it!” he continued,
“ 0 > cours e yer mean it! Be’n’t it yer dooty to
, and me to th > g allows ...
Maconochie pressed down his hand-lower-
lower still—till it touched Tracey’s shoulder,
“Tracey !” he whispered, “Tracey! it is my
du ty to save you from—the gallows. That is
w hy lam here. Tracey—let us be friends !”
No . 3 3-149-his agony wried his mouth as he
spoke—simply repeated “Friends!” and then
bent , lis head upon his sca rred hands. The up-
beaval of his universe had come, for, from the
vortex D f hell had sprung a voice-an official voice
—that had uttered a kindly word. Kind words
he had sometimes had before, but they were from
clergymen ; and the gospellers were bound to say
something kind sometimes to earn their stipends.
While a man might draw twenty breaths
he sat so, challenging his consciousness whether or
no his world was altered. And then, from the core
of the beast-nature with which the System had
superseded that granted unto him by his Creator
—John Price said once “there were doubts as to
the Creator, but there were none as to the System ”
—he spumed once more a torrent of volcanic
hatred and suspicion.
“ It’s all a trap; yer think I be a double
softy to be taken in so? Yer playin’ the forgivin’
to get time to call the guards, ’cos yer afraid I was
a-goin’ to kill yer ! O, yer devil!”
He stood with parching lips and clenched hands,
and the knots bulged on his temples as when a
gymnast braces himself for a feat that will cause
the heavens to resound either with Homeric
plaudits or with his death-scream. Had he sprung,
the help of soldier-guard would have come too late
for the Super. But —
“Stay!” cried Maconochie. “What proof do
you demand that I am not the monster you fancy
me ? How can I show you my truth—that I mean
to be as true a friend to every man here who will
allow me as I can with God’s help be —how can I
do this ?”
The appeal held Tracey in spite of himself.
Scarcely knowing what he did, he gazed through
the one window-space (unglazed) of the hut.
Crossing the parade-ground leisurely were a lady
and a maid-servant. A soldier followed them ten
paces away. He pointed to them, and cried,
hoarsely:—
“ Is that your wife ? ”
Maconochie’s look followed the pointing-finger.
“Yes ! ” he replied.
“ Then, I’ll believe yer if—you—trust—her—
your wife, I mean—in this room alone wi’ me for
five minutes by your watch.”
The Superintendent’s face grew haggard in the
tremendousness of the ordeal. But his soul
answered to the test.
He went out —and said a few words to his wife.
She went in to the room, all unknowing, but
believing utterly in her husband’s wisdom.
* # #
Maconochie lost, in the next moment, his
composure. He thrust'his watch into the hand of
the soldier escorting the lady, and in the same
action, seized the man’s musket.
“In four minutes—four minutes and a-half—
call ‘Time!’” he exclaimed, while he himself
cocked the musket —and waited. So strained was
his hearing to catch any sound from the room,
that though but five yards distant from the
group of officers, he did not hear Mr. Commissary
Shanks say :
“ Well —I’m damned ! Maconochie’s just offer-
ing a bounty for crime!”
* * •
He did not hear that, or indeed ought
else, till the soldier cried, “ Time !” loudly. Then
he started forward, but the appearance of his wife
on the step momentarily arrested his rush. With
the musket still in his hand, he ran to meet her.
She motioned with her head. Through the door-
way he saw—and heard —Tracey. The transport
lay huddled, his head on the floor, his arms out-
stretched in the abandon of despair—or, remorse.
And he was sobbing tearless sobs.
• * *
Not all at once did Tracey, after that
supreme instance of trust, come back to the path
of well-doing. His fight, however, against his past
was strenuous.
It was in February that Cantain Maconochie
trusted him. And till the 23rd October of the
year following, he kept almost a clear record.
“View ” sentences had ceased entirely, and to the
extreme disgust of the gentlemen possessing a
more extensive acquaintance with the System
than Captain Maconochie, Mr. Tobias Tracey
declined to preserve by frequent attendances at
court his average of “ offences needing formal
trial.”
Mr. D. A. C. G. Shanks, on 23rd October,
applied to the Superintendent for a trusty man tu
handle some stores.
And Mr. D. A. C. G. Shanks, being in an un-
bending, not to say affable mood, condescended ta
pass a pleasant word with the trusty man com
missioned by the Super, to wait upon his Oommia-
saryship.
“ You’re Tracey ? ”
“ Yes, sir ! ” with a salute.
Mr. Shanks laughed. “You’re the man tha
Super, trusted the day after he took charge-
trusted his wife with ? ”
There was a conscious pride in Tracey’s voice as
he replied, “ He did, sir !”
“ Why, you donkey, he held a cocked musket in
his hands all the time ! Fine lot of trust in that
wasn’t there ? ”
Convict Tracey was stunned. “Are yer a-
speakin’ o’ th’ truth, sir ? ”
With a brutal oath, Mr. Deputy-Assistant-
Commissary-General Shanks affirmed he was.
* * *
That same evening Tracey broke into Mrs.
Whologhan’s store with a crowbar.

JAMES BAILEY, Proprietor,
THU BEALE PATENT
HIGH ARM SEWING MACHINES
Have, by their continued merits and the general
satisfaction they have invariably given, won the
first place in public esteem, and are on all sides
admitted to be the best and most useful sewing
machines in the market.
FOR USE IN THE HOUSEHOLD
The Beale Machine presents innumerable advant-
ages. The mechanism and the adjustments are
perfect, while the working is most simple; and
the addition of all the most recent inventions and
improvements renders the manipulation of every-
thing connected with the machine a matter of
perfect ease. The result of this is, that with
ordinary care the machine will last for many
years, nothing can get out of order, and no time
is wasted in tiresome meddling with the parts.
It is a servant that will never grumble, never
rebel, never want nights out, willing even on
washing days. It only asks for a careful cleaning
now and then, a snug, dry corner and a little
genuine sewing machine oil. Any other oil will
make it sick, and dirt of all kind it abhors.
The Self-threading- Shuttle, of solid steel,
saves the trouble of threading by the end of the
cotton. It has an excellent tension, is strong and
simple.
The Bobbin Winder is a marvel of in-
genuity, winding and guiding the cotton by
itself, as evenly as upon the reel whence it came,
and stopping of its own accord when the bobbin
is full.
For all kinds of family sewing and fancy the
Beale Machine has the greatest capacity.
The Improved High Arm. A great de-
sideratum with ladies has been the raising of the
arm of the machine, so as to allow the goods to be
sewn freely to pass underneath. This had to be
accomplished without increasing the weight of the
machine. In fact, the Beale runs with wonderful
ease and rapidity. It is almost silent, all clicking
sounds having been obviated. As is well known,
a good test of the finish of any mechanism is its
silence when in rapid motion.
With the Wonderful Beale Machine,
whether for hand or foot use, you can hem any
width, make double seams or fells, braid stitch
with chenille, Berlin wool, or gold cord, and such
like fancy work; you may make a pretty lace
stitch, tuck ever so finely, bind dresses, coats, or
carpets ; sew on trimmings without guiding, make
frilling, ruffling, or ruching; quilt, weave your
own braid with any combination of colours and
stitch it on at the same time; make thick, woollen
door-mats, embroidered antimacassars, window
curtains,-and so forth ; you can easily and rapidly
perform the fashionable shirring or gathering so
popular for sleeves, bodies, or skirts of dresses
with an appliance supplied gratis ; lay the small
cords in hoods and stays ;do large cording; gather
with or without a band, and generally do all
kinds of straight sewing upon any material what-
ever. You can darn upon any woven goods, and
do crewel-work. The Beale Patent will pass
from eight folds of tweed or twenty of calico to
two of thinnest muslin, or even mosquito-net or
tulle, without the operator changing needle,
cotton, stitch, or tension, and the fine material
will not be gathered in the slightest. You may
make button and eyelet-holes, do over-casting,
make herring-bone stitch upon any materials.
This work is absolutely unique, and can only be
accomplished upon the Beale Patent Machine.
Any of these performances will be shown at Gin-
shops at any time. The Beale Patent makes
a lock-stitch, which cannot ravel, yet by a momen-
tary alteration the sewing can be done so as to
rip from end to end, if desired. This peculiarity
is sometimes useful when children’s clothes are
intended to be altered.
Nickel-plating 1 . —In our climate the exposed
parts of the machine, and the applicances, need
to be protected from rust. We have, at consider-
able expense, added a handsomely nickeled wheel,
nickeled plates, screws, appliances, treadle-bar
and cones. Heightening the appearance, these
improvements also tend largely to preserve the
parts. This plating is imperishable.
A special feature of The Beale Machine is
that
ALL THE CABINET WORK
is made at our factory in Sydney from registered
designs, and of the choicest
AUSTRALIAN WOODS,
some of which are without doubt the most beauti-
ful in the world. Suitability to the climate is
thus insured, and we are enabled to offer a greater
variety of styles, most handsome in design and
conveniently fitted for all the requirements of a
lady’s work-table.
These machines can be inspected at any time at
our principal show-rooms in Sydney, or at any of
our suburban and country branch shops, or from
travellers who are continually visiting all parts.
All the machines may be had upon easy time-
payment, or for cash less three shillings in the
pound.

A Run on a Bank.
The daily press has stated that the run on the
Savings Bank of N.S.W. was probably the only
occasion on record where a run on a bank was
started for no apparent reason. However, it
hapoens that an even worse and yet more
silty and purposeless panic springing from ascer-
tained causes took place once in London, and
caused a bigger run on a bigger bank for less
reasons.
• • •
Away back in the gold-digging days a party of
Maorilanders “made a big rise” and started for
England. There were ten of them, seven men and
three women; and they had a letter of credit on
the Bank of N.Z.’s London agents for some =£3ooo
or <£4ooo. They got to the big smoke all right,
and presented their letter of credit, which was duty
cashed. Then they wanted to divide the money
and open separate accounts for their shares. It
so happened that the bank which then represented
the Bank of N.Z. in London did not handle the
latter class of business, and the clerks told the
miners so, at the same time recommend-
ing them to another place a few doors off
—the London and County Bank. This is
one of the most solid institutions in London, a
concern alongside of which the Savings Bank of
N.S, Wales is as a farthing candle to a bush fire.
The miners accepted the advice, walked down the
street to the office of the London and County, and
then pulled up outside, and had a good look at
the place ere going in with their money.
• * #
The spectacle of ten odd-looking people, the
men bearded and burned, the women garishly
dressed, and one and all gaping steadfastly at the
Bank, soon attracted a crowd. It was in
one of the busiest London streets—Lombard-
street. The Maorilanders gazed placidly on,
making up their slow minds whether or
not they Would enter. Meanwhile, the
crowd gathered and surged, all gaping up at
the bank. Questions were passed round the
crowd —“What is it?” “What’s this all about?”
And then someone, at a loss for an answer, said,
“Oh, there’s a run on the bank.” Soon gathered
a seething, surging, howling mob of depositors
outside that bank, and outside everyone of its
branches all over London, fighting to get in. All
day long and all night, and all next day, the people
fought for places in the scrimmage. The bank
officials had barrowloads of sovereigns wheeled out
of the vaults into the banking-rooms, but nothing
would stay the tumult. All sorts of extrava-
gant rumours were afloat as to the cause
of the run. The manager had bolted, the
bank had lost heavily in foreign stock, the
directors had committed suicide, the clerks had
embezzled all the money—there were all sorts
of reasons for the panic. But no one ever thought
of the handful of New Zealanders who deposited
their money and retired, and when the scare
started came back to look after it. They thought
they had struck hideous luck for their bank to be
rushed just as their coin was in—it was clearly a
plot on the part of the Londoners to “ do ” them
out of their money. They joined the crowd, got
their assets back, and not one of them would
afterwards have the slightest faith in any London
institution. The Bank of England might be all
very well, but give them the Bank of New Zealand
for their money.
* « *
Talking of bank rushes, a rather curious inci-
dent occurred in Sydney a few years ago. It was
mooted that a certain bank was in difficulties; an
old man and his wife who had nearly .£5OOO there
rushed off to draw the money. They took it in
notes, tens, twenties, and fifties, after the
manner of Charles Reade’s prudent depositor
in his tale “Hard Cash,” and for a fort-
night or more they guarded this treasure in the
house, fully expecting the bank to break, and
chuckling to think how they had protected them-
selves. One of them used to sit up at night to
watch the treasure while the other slept. Every
step near the house throw them into deadly fear
of robbers. At last they got so tired of it that
they took the lot to a well-known Sydney solicitor
and asked him to invest it for them in some way
—anyhow, so that they shouldn’t have it
on their minds. He explained to them that
if the bank had burst the notes would
have been very little better than the original
deposit receipt, and then he redeposited the lot
with the same bank. They had nearly billed
themselves with worry over paper that would
have been worthless had the bank collapsed,
• * *
Towards the end of the N.S.W. Sayings Bank
scare the bank was paying with sovereigns minted
in 1892. Which looks as if the Mint had been put
into requisition to turn out coin for the occasion.
The Evidence Amendment Act, whereby,
in more than one Australian province, a prisoner
is now permitted to testify on his own behalf,
applies to cases where he, at inception, pleads
guilty. The reason of this is obvious : he might
wish to offer evidence of extenuating circum-
stances.
General Booth announces that the only
area for his over-sea colonies, as yet, is South
Africa. This is what people said before he
started, and his whole “Darkest England” scheme
had its germ in some degree of success achieved
by Arnold White, with Viscountess Ossington’s
money, settling two small colonies of London
paupers in Africa.

set out to the next town to procure a coffin. The
messenger was rather long away, and the hot
weather necessitated summary burial. A mes-
senger was sent out to find the relative, which he
did next morning—under a tree, drunk. The
Gdffin Was on the roadside hard by, and, the cart
Which conveyed it had broken down. The pair
got home ; leaving tile coffin—Which has beert
lyiilg there eVet since in frill view of the passing
teams and coaches.
A FRAGMENT
Across the creek the camp-fires blaze.
And weird the curlew cries,
While blood-red gleam the sums last rays
“ Peace,’* for the Icing day dies;
Hard by the reefs the tents gleam white,
Like peaks all crowned with snow,
Beneath the pale-faced moon's cold light,
“Kest,” now the night winds blow.
Across the creek the morning breaks,
And gilds both ridge and plain,
From slumber now the reef awakes,
“ Toil,” for *tis day again.
Lane Cove, 21/11/91.
A. C. FONTAINE.
WRECKED ON THE GOODWINS.
Erasmus Darwin, grandfather of the famous
Charles Darwin, the naturalist, inscribed upon his
seal the significant words, “ Omnia ex conchis” —
all things arise from oysters. But from what do
oysters arise? What is the origin of matter?
Ah! nobody knows. Yet one thing is getting
plainer every day. Let this man's story show.
He goes on to say : “ On the 17th of December,
1872, whilst acting as ship’s carpenter on board
the steamship Sorrento, I was wrecked on the
Goodwin Sands. The shock to my system was so
great as to produce an effect I never felt before.
I fell into a low, weak state, and was seized with
giddiness and a sinking, fainting feeling. I had a
bad taste in the mouth, weight at the chest, and
great pain after eating, and ray face would burn
like fire. I had difficulty in breathing and palpi-
tation, and often a pain seemed to run from the
heart through to my shoulder. I had a kind of
rumbling all over me, and a choking sensation at
the throat, with a rush of blood to the head.
“I slept very badly, and after a time I got so
nervous and weak I was afraid to go about, and
would sit in a chair quite powerless. I saw a
doctor, who treated me for a time, and then sent
me to a hospital in Rattlebone Place, London,
where I was under treatment for three months,
but got no better. I then put myself under a
local doctor, who said I was suffering from
nervous debility. He patched me up for a little
while, but said to my wife, ‘Your husband is in a
critical condition, and may die at any time.
“ However, I got to work for a short time, and
then was as bad as ever. I lingered on in this
way for years—now a little better, now worse, but
never well.
“ About 1880, whilst working at Messrs. West-
wood and Bailey’s, Millwall, a mate who saw my
sufferings told me of a medicine called Mother
Seigel’s Curative Syrup, and he brought me a
bottle. After taking the first bottle I found my
food agreed with me, and I began to improve.
All nervous feeling gradually left me, and by per-
severing with the medicine I was soon cured.
From that time to this I have been a strong man,
and done harder work than ever in my life before.
I have since kept Mother Seigel’s Syrup in the
house, and my wife, who was a gre'at sufferer
from rheumatism and dropsy, has found more
relief from it than from anything else. If any of
my family ever ail anything, a few doses soon sets
them right.”
The statement from which the foregoing is an
extract was made by Mr. William Hill, ship’s
carpenter, 108, St. Anne’s Road, London, E.
Now, what is the thing which we said is getting
plainer every day ? Why this : that almost an
infinite number of different results arise from a
single cause. Like the majority of people in all
ranks ot life, Mr. Hill had in his digestive organs
the seeds —or what women, when they buy dress
goods, call “ the makings of dyspepsia. Up to
the winter of 1872 it may not have troubled him
much, but the excitement and exposure of the
shipwreck was more than the system could bear.
We must remember, too, that all shocks to the
mind or body, or to both, act directly on the
stomach. Who can eat when under the influence
of a great worry or a great sorrow ? And if this
worry or sorrow continues long, it always upsets
the digestion, permanently impairs or destroys
the appetite, and thus brings on an apparently
incurable dyspepsia and nervous debility. Why,
gracious goodness ! there are millions of women,
and lots of men, crawling about under this thing
in England every day in the year. And it is to
them we talking. They are half dead, and
we want tie m (■> come to life, and get some good
out of their existence. Whatever the ailment is
called, you may be sure indigestion and dyspepsia
is at the bottom of it, as in Mr. Hill’s case, and
what cured him will cure you.
How to Grow Rich.—Invest in land at
Perth, W. A. Plana from Intercolonial Invest-
ment Co.. Limited, 30!) Pitt street, Sydney.
Superintendent Toohey, about to be super-
annuated from the Victorian fooroe, made a
mysterious ass of himself on more than one occa-
sioh; The last time he Came prominently before
the public was .tome fitc of silt years ago* inline*
tlifttely after Ids appointment to suprerrle coni-
mand in the Geelong district. There had been
the murder of a farmer named Beach, at Pettavel,
for which crime Mrs. Beach and a hired man,
sleeping on the premises, were in turn arrested on
suspicion, and discharged for want of any evidence
to connect them with the tragedy. Toohey no
sooner took over his new billet than he cudgelled
his odd-shaped head to find fresh grounds for
suspicion against file feamC. pedplfi: After Working
up a caricature of a “case,” the irrepressible Super-
intendent procured a warrant and proceeded to put
it into execution. Widow Beach and her husband’s
former employe (who had married a wife in the
meantime) were always available for capture,
because they both lived at Pettavel as before, and
Toohey might have whistled them up to him any
time o’ day. Ho preferred, however, to set forth
in the dead of night, armed with a lantern, a pair
of handcuffs and a sinister smile, and swoop down
upon the male Siispect fig 1)0 lay asleep. The poor
devil had to dress himself and be faken off id
chokee by the light of the lantern and moon.
When Toohey’s alleged “case” turned out to be
the merest bosh and was dismissed off hand by
the magistrates the victim brought an action
against his eapturer for playing the fool, but got
no further satisfaction than the payment or his
own costs. The only real fresh evidence against
him, by the way, was that his hair had begun to
turn white since the murder. They might as
well have arrested Toohey, whose hair had been
white before.
The Adelaide police have just found one
John Tims, who has been wanted for six months
on a charge of forgery. He has been in gaol most
of the time right under their eyes, and they never
fioticed hirm They found him, without knowing
it wst® he; Rtld ran him in on another charge,
under another name, and gdt him convicted, and
then they went right on looking for him jiist a®
before, while lie sat in gaol and smiled.
The Pall Mall Gazette gives an instance
of a lady contracting cancer in the lip through
partaking of communion from a chalice used by
another communicant suffering from that disease
in the tongue; and a doctor follows up with ex-
amples of consumption, diphtheria, and other un-
clean disorders fiohtracted in the same way. Still
there is no need for departing from the old-
established custom. A special prayer could bo
devised by the Archbishop of Canterbury to
counteract the danger to health (we are here re-
minded that the Tasmanian Pastor Soltan’s
prayer for earthquakes has been answered); and it
would be a pity to abolish a rite associated with
so many touching lessons of humility and brother-
hood. The most hardened infidel, glancing at the
fcontefits bf even a glass of water just sipped by a
score or so of people vtliO had been 'chewing dry
bread, would be forced to admit that there was
something in the ceremony.
I’lie story goes that when a certain
blustering Melbourne colonel wanted to fight a
duel with a small and democratic doctor the
latter wrote back ; “Sir, unlike you, I am not a
professional fighter but I shall be glad to hold a
post-viorlem on you.”
Quaker Allen came to Queen
uncle, Sussex, asking him to sign a memorial
against capital punishment, and said Cain was not
hanged. “No,” says the Jook, “ they couldn’t
get 12 men for a jury.”
The Maori is a ’cute land-dealer. His
customary form of conveyance doesn’t say that he
transfers the land, but, that he has “ wept over
and bid farewell to this place of his ancestors,
with its rivers, branches, trees, hetbftge,- its
inaccessible places, and its available place®, afia
its inferior places, and all things whether on the
surface of the earth or underneath.” This looks
pretty comprehensive, but then the right to weep
over and bid farewell to a place belongs practically
to any member of the tribe who feels an attach-
ment to the spot, and after the actual and visible
proprietor has been bought out forty or fifty more
Weepers are liable to come along, and they must
all be Solaced With hard cash, else they will
lament till further orders. Thefi, if a Iftgoofi runs
dry the original Maori will send ih a fresh hill for
the ground it occupied, because he sold the 'vvatfet'
but then the water is gone, and he didn’t sell the
dry land which lias come instead of it. Very often
a Maori will sell land according to the above
formula, and then keep on roosting there just the
same, on the ground that there was nothing in the
deed about his not continuing to reside on the
property ; and if he is induced to shift by a cash
consideration or otherwise he will come back and
habitually walk over the ground, because there is
nothing about walking in the deed, and this means
more cash—orelsealawsuic. Arid When the Walking
privilege is settled he will come bafcli sotofe Inofe
and fish for cels in the lagoon, on the ground that
eels weren’t specified in the conveyance ; and alter
this last point has been squared up. and the rights
of living on the property, and walking over it, and
fishing on it are all separately bought and paid
for, he will want to make a fresh sale of his rights
to lean Up against the outside of the fence. I here
is no lawyer who can compare with the old,
veteran Maori for picking holes ill a eOfiVeyahce.
Nobody-ever seems to get altogether rid of him.
Even when his right to lean up against the fence
has been duly bought off him the chances are that
he will send in a bill for the sunshine and the
moonshine, on the ground that they weren’t
mentioned in the conveyance and that it was an
entirely dark property which he sold.
