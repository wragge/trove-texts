The Unique Weekly—Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
*-®-* li o 13 ulletin,'’
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dis
tinctive Australian National Policy,
Tub Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
One Person, one Vote.
Complete Secularisation and Freedom of State
Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
Australia for the Australians.—The cheap
h. Chinaman, the cheap nigger, and the
U cheap European pauper to be absolutely
excluded.
A State Bank, the issue of bank-notes to be a
State monopoly.
Ihe direct_ election of Ministers by Parlia-
ment, instead of Party Government or
rather Government by Contradiction.
A new Parliamentary System - one House to
J 5, be elected by constituencies as at present;
the other to be chosen by the whole
country voting as one Constituency.
A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance.
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-
ship of Land.
The Referendum.
Ihe Abolition of Titles of so-called “nobility.”
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the dajr. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
Ihe Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started eleven years ago with no capital but brains,
has become a vast property, because it pos-
sesses a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailing]y spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin >s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress: it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south, of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

SATURDAY, JUNE 11, 1892.
Parkes upon Kanaka Slavery.
The following letter bearing the signature of
Sir Henry Parkes appears in Sydney Daily
Telegraph :
It is a startling commentary on the high-flown boasts of
Australian democracy that at this moment a proposal is
submitted for a conference of these colonies to consider
the question of introducing into Australia inferior and
unprivileged races of men. The Parliaments of two of the
colonies, it is recorded, have already given their sanction
to the dark irruption. And great interests are at stake
which cannot be conserved without cheap and submissive
labour. What does all this mean? Consider it in whatever
light you will, it means something to be done which the
free men of our own race are not competent to do. It
means some necessity, real or imaginary, which can only
be met by the service of aliens who cannot be admitted to
our franchises, who are ignorant of our conditions of life,
and whose bone and muscle can be obtained on a low
commercial scale. Does it, then, mean slavery ? Let us
see.
There are other slaves besides the human creatures who
are stolen from their native soil and sold in a foreign
market to the highest bidder. Slavery itself may be a
slavery of degrees. There may be an absolute slavery ;
there may he a mitigated slavery. But slavery in any
form has no natural place in the life of a free people. The
only foundation and the only security for the freedom of
a people is political equality. The concession to popular
feeling which has been so widely made that the new
traffic shall be hedged round, by special precautions and
safeguards, concedes too much. Special precautions and
safeguards are incompatible with the equal rights of free
men. But however well designed this exceptional code
of regulations may be, who is to ensure its beneficent
enforcement? There must he functionaries of some sort
in the place of the man-stealer, the man-seller and the
man-driver of the old system with the ugly name. No
one will pretend that the best and most tender-hearted
of men will volunteer for these unenviable posts. Let us
suppose a labour ship—l will not say slave ship—at one of
the islands ; there is no electric telegraph, no press, no
judicial court, no constable, no pulpit or platform orator
to overlook or pry into the ship’s doings ; and do we not
know that the labour agent’s sense of right and duty will
largely depend upon temperament, disposition and bias of
feeling ? But the cause is half abandoned which pleads
for tolerance through this litany of pretences.
We are told by Burkr that where there is “a vast
multitude of slaves, those who are free are by far the
most proud and jealous of their freedom.” Hence the
rebellious spirit of Virginia and North and South Carolina
at the beginning of the revolutionary war. Is this the
latent reason of the desire for inferior and unprivileged
races in Australia? But were we to throw open our doors
to the Indian coolie and the benighted islander, would not
our restriction on the Chinese be a grim farce? In one
respect the proposed new traffic would result in a worse
form of real slavery than the open slave trade supplied to
the Southern States of America. The African slavers
planted both sexes on those rich lands by their awful
trade in flesh and blood, and we know that many happy
family groups relieved the tragic gloom of hopeless servi-
tude.* But we should have loathsome clusters and
sprinklings of one sex embittered by the enforced absence
of the other.
In the course of human progress barbarous peoples have
changed their character by slowly winning step by step
their rights and privileges. It is proposed that we should
reverse the order of progress, and barter away our
character as a free people to secure the profitable invest-
ment of ill-directed capital, which even now reserves its
wage fund for aliens. England expended the gigantic
suin of twenty millions sterling io compensate the West
Indian planters for the emancipation of their slaves. Are
we to gather up our resources to initiate a system of
castes and degraded classes, which cannot exist among us
without weakening our free institutions and vitiating our
national character? The application of the word fedora
to any design of this stamp is a mockery and a profana
tion.

It is noteworthy that the Foreign-trade
press of Sydney has passed this letter by
almost entirely unnoticed. The Telegraph
published it with not one word of comment
or approval. The S. M. Herald and its
mild spectre, the Echo, ignored both the
letter and the writer thereof, and only the
Evening News had the moral courage to
approve of Parkes’ utterances, which it did
without in any sense expressing approval of
Parkes himself. The trail of the National
Association and the Employers’ Union is
over the metropolitan press of Australia, for
these bodies love cheap servile labour above
all things, and the Kanaka is the epitome of
cheap labour in its most servile aspect,
therefore the daily press worships the
Kanaka and his brother the Coolie, and
would gladly sec them spread all over the
Australian provinces. When Parkes was
the prop and mainstay of Foreign-trade
in New South Wales the shoddy press would
have whooped—sadly and reluctantly, no
doubt, but it would have whooped none the
less—for his anti-slavery theories, because in
these days it was necessary to support
Parkes in everything, from his Dead House
to thank troops in down to his garbled
accounts and the shortage in the public
Treasury, for the sake of the cheap calico
cause. But of late Parkes has practically
abandoned the Foreign-trade party, and
there is no longer any necessity to reverence
the ancient fetish, and great is the fall
thereof.

Whether the venerable politician is any
more sincere than usual in his declamations
against Polynesian slavery no one save him-
self can tell with absolute certainty. Pro-
bably even he could not throw any light upon
the question. It is the curse of party
politics that they make no allowance for
sincerity, and the individual who suffers
from that virtue is almost always a failure.
The business of the politician who is out of
office—under the grand old existent system
of Government by Contradiction—is to be
always, and in everything, hostile to the
Ministry, and the business of the politician
who is in office is to be for everything that
is likely to keep his majority together, and
against everything which threatens to dis-
integrate that majority. As Parkes
has held office longer than almost
any other politician in Australia the
reasonable assumption is that he is a good
deal less sincere than even the average of
his kind. But in the present instance there
is very little to be gained, save a small and
inefficient advertisement, by espousing the
cause of the Polynesian, and therefore it
may be presumed that Parkes’ sympathy
for that miserable islander is a genuine emo-
tion. The Dibbs Cabinet has shown no direct
desire to boom the slave-holding interest, so
that even the gratification of contradicting
the Government is denied him, and the
occasion may be noted as the very first one
on record when Parkes, being in Opposi-
tion, did not contradict the Government.
The Kanaka has no vote, and even if he had
one he has no opportunity of voting for
Parkes. He is so far off that he is never
likely even to hear of Parkes. He has no
money to subscribe to a testimonial, and his
signature- if he ever had one—is of no
earthly service on the back of a promissory-
note. Therefore The Bulletin concludes,
with a certain measure of surprise, that Sir
Henry’s letter is written under a purely
generous impulse. Possibly the writer might
have given way to such impulses more fre-
quently if he had not been a politician and a
K C.M.G., and the nefarious system of
Government by Contradiction had never
been invented.

Apart from all questions of sincerity, the
ex-Premier’s protest is a forcible denun-
ciation, and if it had been written by the
Parkes of 12 years ago it would have set
New South Wales aflame. The boss kid-
napper, who is nob allowed to work on
Sundays, and the Government Agent, who
is always to wear gold lace on his sleeves and
hat, and the Polynesian inspector, and all
the rest are only the man-stealer and the
man-seller and the man-driver feebly dis-
guised in a varnish of outer respectability.
The elaborate restrictions that are put on
the traffic are themselves, as ex-Premier
Parkes points out, an evidence against it,
for freedom means equality, and the intro-
duction of a race which cannot be placed
upon an equal footing with the other in-
habitants of this continent is slavery, despite
the surface gilding that serves to cover in
some degree the noisome thing underneath.
The Kanaka traffic, under the new regula-
tions which Griffith has imposed, looks
more honest than any honest traffic can
afford to look. The long list of strictly
Christian rules and laws and bye-laws them-
selves give it away, for such extraordinary
restrictions are only applied to things that
are themselves foul or nefarious, and their
existence puts the trade in the same category
with the importation of Chinamen, and the
sly-grog business, and the sale of poisons, and
the pawnbroking industry, and the Leprosy
Act, and the removal of refuse out of back-
yards, and similar morally or physically
unclean works and callings. The existence
of law is in itself a protest against wicked-
ness, and a business which requires so much
more law than usual is obviously more
wicked than the average. The whole
code which Griffith has constructed, right
down to that moral regulation which forbids
any male entering the female quarters on
board ship “ unless accompanied by the
Government agent,” bears witness to thei
unspeakable vileness of the entire system,
and that regulation is itself a fair
sample of the humorous villainy of the
trade, for it only provides, after all, that if
one man goes into the quarters of the female
slaves with a criminal intent, he shall be
accompanied by another man who probably
has a criminal intent likewise, and thus there
shall be two of them instead of one.
« # •
Parkes and Griffith are old enemies, and
their hatred dates from the time when
Griffith took a leading part in the first
great movement for Australian Federation,
while Parkes stood aloof and did his utmost
(as in the original movement for secular edu-
cation, promoted by a political opponent of
his) to bring the project to ruin. Parkes
and Playford— -the coolie-importer of South
Australia—are also enemies for no very dis-
tinct or well-defined reason, though possibly
their mutual dislike arises from the fact that
Playford looks like a bad moral copy
of Parkes himself, and could pass in a
dim light for a damaged bust of that
aged poet executed by an inferior artist with
a cold chisel. Yet it is strikingly un-
characteristic of Parkes that he has missed
the opportunity to heave vituperation at
these two objectionable politicians. He has
generously taken up a matter which holds
forth no visible prospect of any dividend,
and while advocating the cause of the op-
pressed, he has carefully abstained from
throwing strong language at the oppressor in
his own personal interests. Perhaps even
Parkes is becoming gentle and forbearing
in his old age, or it may be that his with-
drawal from the clamour of politics is respon-
sible for the change. Anyhow, the result is
sufficiently surprising to be worthy of notice.
The spectacle of Parkes among the prophets
is an unwonted experience, and even the
oldest inhabitant of New South Wales can
hardly recollect when any such vision was
seen before.
The South’s Duty Towards the Heathen.
The sudden outbursts of virtuous indignation
that, at fitful intervals, seize upon the public,
both in Australia and England, with regard to
the treatment of the aborigines, are wonder-
fully characteristic of the British people. When
the so-called Exeter Hall crowd raise a voice of
protest against the iniquities of Queensland it
may be safely affirmed that it is simply to
balance a little annexation and spoliation going
on in some other quarter of the globe, probably
Africa. The denunciation of the native police
of North Queensland serves to distract atten-
tion from the slaughter of 400 Jebus and the
capture of their barbaric monarch. So far as
the Australias are concerned it is decidedly a
case of the pot calling the kettle black. The
South gets up and says that it is not as the
North is; but if statistics could be taken, as
many blacks in comparison have probably been
shot in New South Wales, Victoria and South
Australia as in Queensland. In the South, the
nigger-shooting has been left for private hands
to do, with the result that, now and again, in a
virtuous spasm, some unfortunate, no whit
guiltier than the others, has been hanged. When
the nigger has been pretty well wiped out, and
we have got all his country, and hopelessly
degraded what is left of him, then we start
aboriginal stations, reserves and missionaries.
* * »
Speaking from a purely practical point of
view, unconnected with any feeling of duty or
humanity, there is no valid reason why the
nigger should not be wiped out by—let us say,
natural decay. Ethnologists have discussed
him over and over again, and decreed that he is
the lowest existent type of humanity ; that the
prognathism of his superior maxillary almost
degenerates into a muzzle; and that the alveolar
arch, instead of being round or oval is nearly
square. Not to mention that his head is
elongated and depressed in the coixmal region,
and his immense orbits are overhung by pon-
derous superciliary ridges. All this ought to
make him sit down and die out of hand, if he
has any pride left in him. But, unfortunately,
he has not ; what little he ever had, we rob
him of at once by treating him as “a black-
fellow.” He accepts the situation and becomes
“a blackfellow ” in the lowest sense of the
word. It is all there is left for him to do.
What we ought to do from motives of duty and
humanity, if we ever are actuated by such feel-
ings, would be to recognise the fact that while,
as a tame blackfellow, he is despicable, as a
savage he is a respectable member of his own
class of society. When the aboriginal is in his
natural wild state he works hard. He
constructs ingenious weapons with tools that
would make a white mechanic scratch his
puzzled head till it was sore. He ornaments
these weapons after his idea of art; and the
first white robber who comes that way
promptly confiscates them, and probably sells
them to a clergyman who is making a little
collection of curios for friends at ’Ome. He is
a good hunter and works hard for his living.
His womenkind make string out of bark and
therewith make kangaroo nets, fishing nets, &c.
They weave shapely baskets out of grass, and
can sew skins together with a bone. The
savage makes the acquaintance of the white
man (after he has been shot at several times)
and straightway becomes “ a blackfellow.” He
lives on offal and scraps, partly because it is
easier to sit down and wait for such to be chucked
to him, partly because the white robber has
dispossessed him, and spoilt his hunting-ground.
If he makes any weapons now, they are miser-
able shoddy things to be sold for rum or tobacco
When he is too lazy to do this, he sells his woman
Then, when he is ready to become a finished
hypocrite, the missionary comes along ami
makes him one. This is the sort of civilmatioi
that is the secret of England’s greatness. 1

If it could be done, and there is no reason
why it should not be practicable provided

savage. That is to say, those who are still
fortunate enough to be in that position. \yi
have plenty waste land in Australia to’ spare
for the wants of the original holders of'th e
soil ; and as the unavailable districts are
mostly good hunting country, some could be
reserved from the earth hunger of the present
generation to afford a refuge for a dying
despoiled race. The system of reserves
is, of course, in vogue now to a certain
extent. But the reserves in question should
be conducted on a very different principle
Exclude every white man from the place
save the one or two properly accredited officials
Keep out equally the greedy land-grasper and
the meddling missionary. The experience of a
century has taught us that the aboriginal is
non-receptive so far as permanent improvement
is concerned, and is far better off in his ori»inal
state than as a loafer on the white man, w?th a
yearly dole of a blanket on the birthday of
Kaween Wikitoria. The Maoris, a warlike
and powerful race, fought for an independent
tract of their own, and won it by the strong
hand. The States and Canada have their
Indian territory. The Australians, a weak and
scattered few, have their acres wrested from
them without parley or apology, and are
then abused for degenerating. This, of
course, is a way all nations have* of
serving weaker ones, but what right have
Victoria and New South Wales, which
have finished off their own aboriginal trouble
to bark at a newer province for repeating the
practice they first initiated ? The very jshop
wherein the smug citizen who holds up his
hands in pious horror at the reputed atrocities
of the Queensland people, makes a living, ig
probably erected over the bones of a murdered
aboriginal. No ! the only chance for the native
is to keep him apart from the whites, for our
touch withers, and our breath blights. Give
the remaining natives a few detached areas of
the unoccupied land on our continent whereon
they can live unmolested ; and let them there
die out as decent savages, not amongst ns as
outcast blackfellows. And, above all, do not let
the pious inhabitants of New South Wales go
round throwing stones recklessly at the other
provinces, because if they have no blacks left to
shoot, it is only because their fathers and
grandfathers did all the slaughtering for them.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Globetrotter on Agriculture.
The Earl of Meath, a British nobleman who
has lately been maundering round Australasia
on some undefined religious errand, left a
conundrum behind him at Auckland for the
people of these provinces to solve. It is the
same conundrum which every fuzzy-headed
British pietist does leave behind him, and the
constant repetition of it shows how much utter
drivel and stupidity, and how very little plain
horse-sense, goes to make up a great nation :
The problem is as follows :
What I cannot understand is how, with your vast area
of unoccupied land, there should be any unemployed in
Australia.
That is also what Booth wanted to know, and
David Christie Murray, and Sir George
Campbell, and John el Sullivan, and a
great number of others ; and most of them
also desired to be informed why, with such a
great area of land, Australia can’t take in all
the poor of the United Kingdom, and furnish
them with homes, and thus build up a great
nation. And not one in all the great agglomera-
tion of asses seems to realise the facts of the
case, which are these. (1) The emigrant, in
nine cases out of ten, is not a farmer, therefore
the land is no good to him. (2) He can’t be
turned into a farmer, for agriculture doesn’t
come by instinct. The average Briton always
imagines that any scavenger or decayed sailor
or broken-down shoemaker can farm in Aus-
tralia, though the idea of the same individual
being capable of farming in the waste lands
of England is too ridiculous to be considered.
(3) There is no more an unlimited demand for
agricultural produce than there is for red silk
pocket-handkerchiefs or paper collars, and the
number of producers can’t be indefinitely in-
creased in this line more than any other unless
the consumers are increased also. (4) The
typical emigrant has no money to buy land, and
if Australia takes him in and gives away her
inheritance for his benefit she has next to build
roads and railways to carry his produce, there-
fore he is for many years a dead loss. (5) He has
also no money to build a house, to fence his land,
to buy seed and agricultural implements, and
without these the land is of no more use to him
than is a diving apparatus, or a steel girder. (6)
Avery great part of Australia is of little-
good without irrigation. The emigrant, or the
city “ unemployed,” who is often the same
individual in a later stage of development, has
no money to irrigate with, therefore unless the
Government finds the money he is helpless, and
in any case it would be cheaper to build a big
factory for him and make him a present of it
than to give him a block of land gratis, and
find him in tools, and railway communication,
and artesian water supply, and keep him till he
realises a crop, especially seeing that he seldom
knows anything more about how to realise a
crop than he does about realising an oil-paint-
ing. (7) If Meath or any other visitor were to
go out penniless into the great desert with only
a spade he would understand all these things,
and a great many more which are now crowded
out for want of space.

The Labour Agency Swindle.
At a time like the present, when business is
stagnant and work is scarce, the labour agency
shark flourisheth exceedingly throughout Aus-


tralia. His business is one that requires no
capital, no brains, and very little energy ; all
that is really essential is a small, dirty office,
an utterly callous soul, and a board outside the
door stating that domestic servants, pick-and-
shovel men, and all sorts of other employes are
“ wanted.” Also-, it is advisable now and then
to insert an advertisement in a daily paper,
setting forth that there is a vacancy for a clerk,
and that the hours are short and the salary
liberal and the work exceedingly light. This
draws attention to the office if business shows any
signof fallingoff. Such an advertisement will fetch
at least a hundred applicants, and the labour-
agency man interviews them one at a time, and
is so entirely satisfied with each man’s capa-
bilities and so perfectly sure ho will get the billet,
that the preliminary charge of ss. for an intro-
duction to the alleged employer seems a matter
too small to be worth considering. Then the
applicants interview the “ employer,” who
generally proves to be just such another dirty-
looking man as the agent himself, lurking in
just such another dirty office ; and from him
they leani that the vacancy has, unfortunately,
been filled up exactly an hour earlier. No
one, of course, can absolutely prove that there
never was any vacancy or any successful
candidate, though the fact that no clerical staff
is visible save a pimpled boy reading a cheap
scalp-story in an empty room, seems to point to
that conclusion. No clerk ever does get a billet
through such a labour office, and no employer of
any repute would hire the ordinary, mangy-look-
ing agent as a healthy medium through which to
obtain one, but the drowning “unemployed”
catches at straws, and the ordinary labour-agent
is a straw—and a very unpleasant one at that.
Now and then he finds a job for a few pick-and-
shovel artizans—that is to say he copies the
advertisements in the morning paper, and puts
them on his board, and charges ss. for giving
the address; and if there is nothing doing in
this way he hires them for a mythical billet
somewhere in the bush—so far in the bush that
they seldom get back to commit a justifiable
and well-deserved homicide upon him and all
his family. He also finds genuine jobs in cheap
restaurants where the wages are low and
the work tremendous and the hours 18 per
diem, but in this case the restaurant-keeper
generally sacks his employes every week, and
gets anew lot from the same office, and the ss.
which is paid by each one for a week’s work at
starvation wages is divided between the agent
and the employer. Also, in addition to these
things he often does a little business in domestic
servants —generally for houses of ill-fame. The
Australian is a patient and long-suffering
animal, and though he will at times give way
to great excitement over politics he endures
such swindles as these with hardly a protest.
Yet the remedy is sufficiently obvious. In
the city of New York the labour-agency
fiend is a licensed person, and is liable
to have his license cancelled and his
business shut up if his frauds become
too conspicuous. And for every individual
whose fee he accepts, he must find employment
within one month, or should he fail to do so,
the fee has to be returned in full. If he doesn’t
return the fee then chaos supervenes. The
American law deals tenderly with the swindler
who has taken a million dollars, but for the
labour-office man who has gone off with one
dollar, it has no bowels of compassion what-
soever. The adoption of this system, in all its
naked simplicity, is just what Australia wants
very badly at the present juncture.
Somnolent Victoria.
The hollow bray of asininity is so frequently
heard in the council chamber of Melbourne
Town Hall that the recent belching of Godfrey
Carter, M.L.A., at a little bon voyage function
to the glory of Fitz Gibbon was allowed to pass
unnoticed by a tired outside world. Yet from
the mouth of Carter came a specially poisonous
exhalation right on top of the most pompous
display of wilful ignorance ever uttered by a
“ loyal ” ex-Mayor. Before venting the sinful
suggestion that “ a thoroughly Liberal Govern-
ment, supported by a Liberal majority, might
he guilty of repudiating its financial liabilities,”
a suggestion so absurd that even a hard-shell
Tory like James Service snorted his dissent,
the member for Melbourne city had been more
seriously funny than he intended. In the
first instance, Carter admitted that Victoria
might get rid of its depression the sooner if the
political Houses were closed for a time. Such
little jokes at the expense of the taxpayer are
expected at civic guzzles, and the “repre-
sentative ” audience laughs hoarsely. “ But,”
added the gruesome joker, “as the people
insisted upon having a Parliament and upon
having 95 members talking every night
upon subjects they knew very little about,
he saw no remedy for the present state of
things.” The offensive jocularity pf Carter
lay in his assumption that the Parliament of
Victoria is a favourite institution. Asa matter
of fact, there is nothing really popular in that
portion of the continent, except a horse-race,
and the demand for 95 Members of Parliament is
a monstrous myth. The people of Victoria are
so deplorably indifferent to everything per-
petrated in their name that a Government pro-
posal to double the number of electorates would
be swallowed with scarce a murmur. Parlia-
ment there (as elsewhere, in a less degree)
doesn’t represent the people, seeing that com-
paratively few of them vote for anybody at all,
and most" of those who do go to poll may be
heard scoffing at the man or men they have just
voted for as being the doubtful best of a bad
lot. Not one candidate in ten is earnestly sup-
ported, or expected to justify his election by
the wisdom and purity of his political life.
Carter may be one of the tenth men,
recognised by his Tory constituents as
a reliable mouthpiece of proputty and sworn
enemy of the “masses,” but even his little
section of the country doesn’t insist upon
having him for a member, although he gets
there all the same. By the country at large he
and his 94 colleagues are merely endured. An
increase in the number of electorates made
some few years back was laughed at but per-
mitted to pass, and the sudden doubling of the
95 would, as suggested above, excite no riots.
If, on the other hand, a petition to reduce the
present number of members by one-half were
put before every adult male in Victoria, 95 per
cent, of the voting community would sign their
names with a joyous flourish, and when the
half-mile of document had been laid upon
the table of the House and repudiated
by the alleged representatives of popular
opinion, the community would feebly accept
the situation and doze oft' again. The people of
Victoria regard their Parliament as something
that is and can’t be avoided—and nothing more.
They neither insist upon returning 95 members
nor desire them to talk in the manner supposed
by Godfrey Carter. They express in private
the belief that reckless roguery is the surest in-
troduction to Parliamentary pre-eminence, and
they haven’t any tangible public beliefs whatso-
ever.

The alleged “ withdrawal of capital ” from
Maoriland, which has been vociferously howled
about ever since the democratic Ballance
Cabinet came into office, is still progressing.
The latest trouble comes from the “Trust and
Agency Company of Australasia,” which
threatens to shift £IOO,OOO of cash out of the
province and leave it desolate. The “Trust
and Agency ” concern is a prosperous institution
whose dividends range as high as 20 per cent. —
they have been higher on more than one
occasion, but 20 is high enough, anyhow. The
people of Maoriland have been blessed for
many years with the joyous privilege of paying
that 20 per cent, on their end or the business,
and now they are informed that, unless the
absentee taxes imposed by the Ballance Go-
vernment are removed, the privilege will be
withdrawn. That is about what the trouble
amounts to. When a man pawns his watch,
and the pawnbroker charges him 80 per cent,
on the money advanced—that is the investment
of capital. And when the man redeems his
watch, and stops the awful accumulation of
interest, that is the locking-up of capital—the
pawnbroker’s capital. And then, if the pawn-
broker can’t find anybody else to put his watch
up the spout and pay the 80 per cent., that
is the final withdrawal of capital, and the
results, according to the Tory press, are ruin
and inevitable stagnation.

When Yictoria’s land-boom was rosiest,
Speaker Tom Bent, as head of a syndicate, grabbed
the Korongah estate, near Belfast, of nearly 4000
acres, at £2G per acre. Of course, the land was
sub-divided into small farms, but as only a few
fetched £3O per acre the rest were withdrawn.
Since then the land has been leased for agricul-
tural purposes. The other day a frantic effort
was made to sell 1000 acres, and 580 were disposed
of. Of these 100 averaged £3O each, and the
others £25. The worst of the remainder may
fetch a fiver at auction, and the syndicate drops
heavily. Who would fill a Speaker’s Chair that is
stuffed with such thorns as these? j
Dear Bulletin,—A short while back a
man was blown into eternity while blasting rock
at Glenbrook (N.S.W.). His mates quizzed around
for his remnants, and took what they could find
down to his tent, where it was decided to have a
wake. One of their number carved out an artistic
cross ; floral tributes from sympathetic friends
showered in abundantly, candles were placed at
liberal intervals round the bier, a cask of stagger-
juice was put on tap, and all night long the com-
plaining morepork was chilled into silence by the
most awful wailing, and drinking, and other
sorrow that imagination could picture. By the
early train the parents of the dead man arrived,
and no sooner did they review the remains, and
the candles, the tobacco ashes, the tail ends of the
feast, the demolished spirit keg, and things in
general than it struck them like a horse-kick that
a mistake had been made—a real Erin-green wake
had been held over a red-hot Orange Protestant.
What followed was too painful for description,
but it will be along time before another Protestant
gets a wake from the wild Irishmen of the Blue
Mountains.—Yours, &c., Zero.

captain gave chase and fought 16 rounds with his
enemy till at last he stunned it with a tremendous
blow on the nose and then strangled it. It is
about six feet long, eight feet in circumference,
and is possessed of four flappers. The front pair
measure close on eight feet from tip to tip, and
the weight of the body is estimated at between
seven and eight cwt. The carcase is completely
encased in shell, both above and below. That on
the back is shaped something like a shield and is
ribbed and fluted, the shell being splashed with
white spots on the dark ground. The head is
fish-like in shape, and about 9 or 10 inches long. It
is provided with eyes and spout holes, but
apparently is without ears. Upon opening the
mouth a formidable array of teeth are discovered.
What might be termed the terminal of the under
jaw outward, is a sharp parrot-like tooth, and on
the upper jaw are a couple of similar ones to match.
Inside both the mouth and throat is one mass of
teeth about an inch in length. The neck is
remarkably thick, and the creature was able to
raise its head about 18 inches when fighting or
swimming. From which it would appear that the
sea-serpent is the son and heir of the old fish-
lizard. Possibly his father is still lying low at
the bottom of the sea waiting events, and when
he comes up trouble will eventuate.
The Eddy-Schey Commission.
Scene : Sydney Equity Court—a Court designed
after Chief Justice Harley’s own heart —(that is to
say, there is about one-eighth of the room avail-
able for the public, and the rest is sacred to the
noble profession of the Law). There is a small,
low gallery at one end which constitutes the only
place reserved for the people, and into it they are
jammed as tightly as possible. If any ventured
to stray within the sacred precincts of the lawyers
they would probably be put to death for “con-
tempt.” In the middle and along the sides of the
Court are the seats - sacred to the legal fraternity.
These gentry are not engaged in the case —they
are merely looking on. Large numbers are pre-
sent ; evidently having nothing to do in their
offices they come here to pass the time. There
are more of them round the walls and leaning
against the mantelpiece. To the right of the
bench the reporters are grafting away like demons
with the printers’ devils waiting for copy. Why
do printers’ devils always look bored and discon-
solate ? If a printer's devil went to a pantomime
for copy he wouldn’t look at the pantomime. He
would lean against something and stare at the
floor and look tired. Perhaps they are born
tired. In front of the bench is a big table
where the dramatis personal sit. There is the
heavy villain, Mr. Schey, a fat man with a flat
forehead, straight nose, sharp eyes somewhat sunk
in the fatness of his cheeks, his mouth and chin
covered by a stubby, hay-coloured beard. There
is the injured hero, Mr. Eddy.
Eddy is a disappointment. One had
expected a large, dictatorial, autocratic, over-
bearing sort of personage, with big eye-
brows, bristly beard, and a hoarse voice.
He is a large man certainly, but flabby
and soft-looking ; wears a vast frock-coat, which
flaps loose upon him like a giant’s robe upon a
thievish dwarf; has a somewhat feeble, smug
countenance, soft beard, and lank, straight hair.
Very like a lay preacher of the Methodist per-
suasion, or a shop-walker in a ladies’ drapery
establishment. Beside him sits Oliver, one of his
brother Commissioners. Oliver is a modified
edition of Jack Want—bristly eyebrows, aggres-
sive moustache, fighting under-jaw. He is a
fighter from the ground up, is Oliver; has been
so all through his career. When he was in
the Lands Office, in the flush times of free
selection, things got into a muddle. The Survey
Department couldn’t keep pace with the work.
The Lands Department got behind-hand also.
Oliver came to the front from a subordinate posi-
tion. He worked night and day and posted him-
self up in everything. When the Minister wanted
information he could never get it from anyone
except Oliver. He knew more about the Survey
Department than the Survey officials themselves.
He had to fight the bitter enmity of various moss-
grown placemen, but he came through it all and
secured the Under Secretaryship of Lands, which
meant practical control of the whole Lands Office.
Thence he went to the Railway Commissionership,
and has thereby got about as high in the service of
the country as a non-professional man can get. At
the table also sit the minor characters of the play
—M'Lachlan, Secretary for Railways, a tough
and energetic customer with a long memory
and no nerves ; Smith, Attorney for the
Commissioners, a sharp-faced man with hair
standing straight up like quills upon the
fretful what’s - his - name. On Mr. Schey’s
behalf appears Crick, M.L.A., champion mud-
slinger of the House, the only man Parkes is
afraid to tackle in an interchange of epithet. If
Parkes called Crick a withered tarantula Crick
would probably call Parkes a “lop-eared some-
thing with the morals,” &c., &c. So Parkes and
others let Crick alone.
* * •
On the Bench sit the Royal Commissioners
—Owen (Judge in Equity), John Young, and
Alexander Kethel. Judge Owen, in his wdg and
gown, is about the most imposing-looking Judge
in N.S. Wales. But upon that Bench, without
his hairy ornament, he is not so imposing-looking
as his two colleagues, both unlettered men com-
pared to him. There is a rugged dignity and a
practical common sense about them which inspires
much respect. The questions they put are always
terse and to the point. John Young argues with
Schey and corners him with great skill.
# # *
The proceedings are little more than a
farce. Mr. Schey, after having in the House
charged the Railway Commissioners with every-
thing from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter, has
suddenly “withdrawn from the affair” and left
the Royal Commissioners to do what they think
best. They are paid to find out whether there is
any truth in the charges. With this object they
put Mr. Schey in the box and question him. He
is quite at his ease, and fences with the President
with great skill. He will give no definite inform-
ation. He believes his charges were true. People
told him certain things and he believed them and
made the charges. He won’t give their names.
Ho won’t say on oath that his charges were
true, but is of opinion they were. So the affair
goeson from oneoharge to another, Somemisguided
people have an idea that Mr. Schey is a very deaf
and helpless person who finds himself in an un-
pleasant predicament and heartily wishes himself
out of it. Not at all. He is quite at his ease and
gives the Commission a Roland for their Oliver
every now and again. For instance, the President
starts at him as follows —“ You say, Mr. Schey,
that the Railway Commissioners were guilty of
ignorance or incompetence or something worse.”
Mr. Schey—“I meant what I said—something
worse.” “ Yes, but there are many things worse
than ignorance or incompetence—what was the
particular thing you meant? ” “ Well, the words
are ordinary English. I said something worse,
and I meant something worse.” “ Yes, but what
worse thing did you mean?” “I meant some-
thing not so good.’’ “ Then the Commission under-
stands that you meant nothing in particular.” “ I
am not responsible for what the Commission
chooses to understand.” Judge Owen, hotly;
“No, but you are responsible for what you say,
sir 1” “ Oh yes, and I said—‘something worse !’ ”
* # #
A very few minutes in the room convinces
any unprejudiced person that if Mr. Schey has
any evidence to offer he has every chance of offer-
ing it. Some people think he was blocked from
putting his case by his ignorance of technical
matters. In truth, the whole aim of the Commis-
sion is directed to getting him to say something
definite —anything that can afford any informa-
tion. But he has “washed his hands of the
matter,” and is too artful to give any assistance to
the Commission which will either prove or dis-
prove the charges. Whether he can wash his
hands of the responsibility of having made a
violent attack upon people who, so far as any
pro f to the contrary brought by him is con-
cerned, have apparently been serving the country
to the best of their ability, is another matter.

To all those who believe in socialism as
against individualism, the success of the N.S.W.
State-owned and State-managed railways is of the
greatest importance. If this management fails,
then the State will fail also to manage other and
more delicate undertakings. And when three
men are chosen to take charge of this great
national undertaking, it is bad that the whole
system should be endangered by the attacks of a
man who throws mud from behind the fence of
parliamentary privilege and then afterwards
“washes his hands of the whole affair,” hoping
that some of the mud will stick on the men whom
he has attacked.
* * *
If Australia cannot manage her railways she
will have to lease or sell them, and thus hand
herself over to the tender mercies of railway-
kings and monopolies. And we will never get first-
class men to manage our railways if they are to be
subject to abuse and misrepresentation without
any redress. The railway servants who demand the
abolition of the Commissioners would find them-
selves in a very much worse plight if they were
the servants of a company who would begin by
sacking half of them, and go on to work the other
half to death at low wages.
We put it to the Sabbatarian Pastor Soltau
—the Tasmanian earthquake man the
Melbourne depression is not due to the post-office
private boxes being open on Sunday ?
Jacob Goldstein, of Melbourne, writes a
newspaper puff about his friend Dr. Renwiok, in
which he holds him up to fame as a man who had
“refused portfolios in three cabinets.” Which
reminds us very much of that scene in Besant’s
novel, “the Bell of St. Paul’s,” wherein the
Chevalier’s health is proposed as that of a dis-
tinguished soldier who had “ run away from four
pitched battles.”
Dear Bulletin, — Let me tell you of
Paddy Miller’s ball. Some time back the Tip-
perary boy who carted wood to our (S.A.) boring
camp called upon us one evening and invited all
hands to his daughter’s birthday ball; you bet, we
went. On arrival at Paddy’s chateau, we found
the ballroom —size, 12ft. by 13ft.—crowded —■
packed, in fact. The orchestra, consisting of two
accordeons, a flute, and a tin whistle, were seated
in the ample fireplace, and a five-gallon
wicker jar filled with beer right in the
centre of the ballroom was the pivot around
which the backblocks youth and beauty
radiated. After a while, the heat of the room
having become intolerable, I asked our host if I
might open the window. “ ’Deed, thin, yez can’t,
sor,” replied Patrick, “but if it’s ventilation yer
want —Mary, pull out the corks ! ” My attention
just then was called to the flowing bowl, and I
naturally thought Paddy’s remarks had reference
to beer. In a little while, however, I noticed now
and then a low, moaning, weird sound, a sort of
accompaniment to the polka which was being
played by the band, and as the dancers were warm-
ing up to their work, and the beer beginning to tell,
I mentioned the subject of air again to the lord of
the castle. “ Musha, thin, sor, but ye’re the divil
for ventilation. Shure Mary pulled out all the
corks on the aist side, an’ if the corks on the wesht
side is pulled out, begob the bhlast that ’ill come
through will blow the gurls’ ball-toggery over their
heads, so it will.” The ingenious Paddy, finding
ordinary windows too expensive, had knocked the
bottoms out of a score or more of bottles and had
them built (neck-inwards) into the mud of which
his shanty was built. —J.O.R.
This story is told of the late “ Ted” Lee
of N.S.W. who was looked upon as an infallible
tipster by his old school-mates, even though many-
a-one of them had had bitter experience to the
contrary. At the time of the Champion race at
Randwick when Ben Bolt was beaten by Zoe, Lee
was supposed to know all about it. On the day of
the race Ranny Want came to him in the paddock
and said : “Eb, old man, I know you know all
about Ben and Zoe—which do you think will
win?” “Well, Ran, old chap,” said Lee, work-
ing away at his finger-nails, “ I don’t see how the
old horse is to be beat.” This was enough for
Want, who immediately invested with Charlie
York the few pounds he had in his pocket, at
whatever price that not too liberal sportsman
would lay. After the race, which was won by
Zoe, Want was coming down the steps from the
Grand Stand to the paddock, looking, and feeling,
very crest-fallen, and just in front of him was Lee
with his arm on a friend’s shoulder, and gleefully
saying ; “ I pipped it right that time and have won
a couple of hundred ; I knew the old horse had no
chance.” Want rushed up to him when they got
down stairs and said : “ What’s that I hear you
say ? I thought you told me the old horse couldn’t
be beat, and now you tell David Bell that you
knew he had no chance.” “ Well, Ran, old man,
I know I did. I’m very sorry, but you're such a
damnable sieve." Those who know Want’s pro-
verbial propensity to “ blab ” will appreciate this
story.
Cornhill describes the scene at the trial
of Parson Clutterbuck, the Church of England
preacher, who swindled confiding old women by
promising to invest their money in Government
securities at 10 per cent.: —
In the court below stood the prisoner’s father, a white-
faced old man, like a bad bust of Vespasian, with a blank,
glazed eye, and the cords of his throat straining out of
his coarse red muffler. Sometimes he turns without
emotion or curiosity to look at his offspring, who now
throws back the cape of his coat dramatically, and stands
with arms folded, and now fidgets with the yellow rails of
the dock, with a hand that is as plainly bad as his face.
. . . . Four years’ penal servitude—and the convict
bows and bends himself away like a beaten hound. And
out of court shuffles, still quite emotionless, the old
father, in a long drab ulster, and the few hairs standing
straight above his curious round head, with its flat top.
It is a strikingly familiar scene. When some
particularly bright and shining saint is on
trial for a specially mean swindle, unless he is an
orphan, it is an even chance that there is just such
another blank-eyed, flat-headed old man maunder-
ing in the court and watching the result. If the
grandfather is there too—whi ch doesn’t of ten happen
—the three make a study in heredity. We saw such
a trio once. The son —in the dock —had a sugar-
loaf cranium, and a weak chin, and a shifty eye.
The father, shuffling about aimlessly in the body
of the court, had a skull that was perfectly flat,
and on top of it one hair stood up in wild con-
fusion. And doddering in a corner was the aged
grandfather, with a long, horse-like countenance
that was utterly expressionless except that he
looked as if he wanted some oats. Once he got on
his feet suddenly, and we instinctively said
“ woa !” It would have been worth a lot to have
had the great-grandfather along with the group,
but he was dead. Someone showed us his tomb-
stone afterwards though, and if there ever was a
tombstone that was calculated to be put over a
bull-dog that was the one. We formulated a
maxim out of that family group, and this is it:
“Never trust the son of a flat-headed father, or
the grandson of a man with a horse-shaped
countenance.” If you do you will assuredly be
left, especially if the grandson has a head with a
peak at the top.

816 Macquarie strcet North, Sydney, June 8,1592.
My Dear Moorabinda, —
The only things I didn’t like at Walter Bentley’s
“ Hamlet ” were mere trifles. Watt-Tanner, as the Queen,
hadn’t enough tails to her stage ermine to duly impress
the circle, and Laura Hansen brought iu a very unsuit-
able collection from the face of nature for her “larded
with sweet flowers” scene. “Here’s heart’s ease ” said
she, handing a lanky jonquil to Laertes. By the way,
Air. Bentley’s “Hamlet.” isn’t extensively Bowdleriscd,
and when an actor gives Shakespeare his head the
innocent d.c. maiden passes most of her time directing a
blank stare at Hie roof. At one passage of the tragedy I
thought some of the darlings would crick their little
necks.
Woman, you know, ought always to study to be a tiling
of beauty, hut she can’t do it if she goes cycling. And I
am afraid she will, for at a recent meeting of the Sydney
Bicycle Club four ladies were admitted to membership.
Now, I have seen a Sydney she-bicyclist in going-order,
and I have a fatally clear vision of half-an-inch of white
embroidery hanging below a narrow skirt which had
worked up all round, revealing lace boots, black ho —
but I mustn’t proceed. She didn’t look a bit happy,
and she kept on making dives at her skirt to pull it down,
but it wouldn’t pull, and her male escort seemed to want
the earth to open and swallow him, so did she when the
embroidery fluttered more than usual. If Sydney girls
intend to take the air on wheels instead of legs, they must
follow the lead of a certain cycliste who, I hear, gets over
the dress bother by adopting man’s attire, and local
belledom, when it orders round its fiery tricycle, must
leave its goffered jupons behind, too, and come out boldly
in the divided garment—there is really no help for it. Of
course, the girl with knock-knees may consider the effect
of Turkish trousers, and the seraph with nice ankles may
be allowed to discover that knickerbockers and stockings
are ever so much cooler—but the ground-plan, as it were,
must be forked or else the modest youth will look another
way when a lady cyclist turns a breezy corner. But,
however you arrange matters, a woman astraddle is a
Hideous Object.
There’s a lot of nonsense talked and written about
“ mother’s love,” and .-lie shriek of the whole army of
matrons if a drunken woman has her howling infant taken
from her by the law is, in my opinion, another audible
reason why we shouldn’t have petticoats voting. In a
recent (Southern) divorce-case a tipsy, unfaithful wife was
forcibly deprived of her neglected olive-branch, which was
handed over in court to the father, a seemingly decent
person, who promised that she should have access to it
now and again—and one would think that the respectable
Australian matron would have been delighted at the
rescue of the youngster from so depraved a “parient”—
but, no. “ A Mother ” looms in public print lamenting
that the divorced female (who had hysterics in court, of
course) wasn’t given time for “one last kiss—one parting
embrace,” &c., and trusted (with asperity) that future
petitioning husbands might be possessed of a little more
“ milk of human kindness.” A feminine judge, I sup-
pose, would have allowed the maudlin mamma to shed
whisky-inspired tears down the infant’s pinafore while the
co-respondent went out and bought more cake and ham
for it; also, legal business would have been obstructed
while the poor mother sadly curled up Tommy's hair on a
door-key for the last time. But it hardens one’s sympa-
thetic soul to remember that the infant was there to be
idolised all along, and yet the lady preferred the cordials
—and the co respondent; though it is extremely likely,
mind you, that some other woman will discover that the
poor thing’s great, motherly, broken heart was probably
big enough for all three.
I can’t help wondering if, when he and she are legally
torn asunder, there is no “sorry I spoke” feeling on her
part, especially when he is rich ? As an instance I know
of one woman in a Southern city who foolishly discarded
her old man because he was too sweet on the inevitable
governess. The law kindly awarded her the family (some
lanky girls and a hungry hoy crying out for education)
and she swaggered out of court with them—but after a
while, as the sum her ex-hub. paid her wasn’t large, and
she had to live in a little house, and worry to make both
ends meet, divorce didn’t seem such a happy release after
all. Hubby married the bone of contention, 100, who
flaunted in and out of the gilded gates in Hie carriage
“ that once was mine,” and, to add to the miseries, the
lanky girls had to “go out” governess! nsr, and heaped
reproaches on her head for reducing them to a state of
indigence when they might have been in satiety; and the
hungry hoy always fixed her with a reproachful glare as
he went to his little ten-and-sixpenny billet of a morning
It is no doubt a womanly thing to shunt the wicked old
man when he runs off Hie marital track, but it isn’t strict
business, and though a woman may easily relinquish the
sentimental, she must never lose grip of Hie material.
For what is the im of the wedded Angelina beggaring
herself and her children while the fair co-respondent is
elevated into her place ? It is kind of her to eliminate
herself and give the other woman a show, of course, hut
she is a lovely idiot if she does. And looking round at the
state of this and that household it becomes apparent that
she doesn’t do it renj often nowadays.
A Mrs. Somebody advertised in a daily the other day for
“a governess, not elderly,” ami I was quite puzzled ut
this extraordinary mark of confidence in Mr, Somebody
until I accidentally discovered that the advertiser was a
widow.
“ Masks and Faces ” was the fleeting show at the Royal
on the glorious first of June, and the artistic Mrs. B.R.
waved three very satisfactory garments at a representa-
tive circle which included Mayor and Mayoress Manning
and ex Mayor and Mrs. Burdekin. Thelatter brought a large
party with them. Mrs. Beere’s first staggerer was a
inadeira-eoloured velvet, trained Directory coat with
Watteau back and iappets of gold galon over a yellow silk
jape ; hat of velvet with yellow plumes, and a white cane
with bouquets of daffodils completing the costume. In
the second act, Peg wore a vermillion-red velvet sleeveless
coat over an Empire front of silk cn unite edged round the
hem with gold tassels, the Empire waist dclined by gold
netting. In the third act, Isabel “ Urkert” (she shouldn’t
paint her lips so rose-hudishly in the middle —when the
crimson goes up to the nostril it looks as if the lady were
trying to lick the tip of her nose) wore a very charming
costume of cream silk with floral stripe in blue and pink
and flounces of white lace—hut it was altogether Loo
modern. The semi-Watteau pleat lined with pink was a
sop to the century, hut it had nothing to back it up,
except the lady’s handsome mantle of peach-pink brocade
with sleeves and dorsal stripe of moss-green plush, which
was just the sort of thing a person’s great-grandmother
(if she had one) used to sport. Mrs. Deere’s garment in
tiie last act was a stiff saoque of copper brocade over a
petticoat of yellow satin veiled in cent lace, red shoes
which showed off well in the sand-jig that Peggy (I fell in
love with her Irish brogue, by the way) danced with her
arms a-kimbo. And if 1 had space I would make a little
fuss over Marius’ white velvet brocade suit with gold
tassels and rutiles which—if the combination of colours
did rather remind one of ship’s cabins—was altogether too
fetching when taken in conjunction with the coach-and-
horses patch that drove furiously over Sin jin’s ex-hus-
-1 and’s wicked left eye.
One difference between the Deere and (lie Porter—l
mean the Potter—is that while Deere’s rich draperies are
subordinate to the lady herself, Potter’s rags used to rise
up, as it were, and strike you violently in the eye. The
lovely Cora only wanted a squeak and a sawdust interior
to be a model doll.
And, talking of dress, actresses, and their ways—is it a
rule in the society dramatic world for actresses (whoso
stage plumage is gall and wormwood to every would-be
smart woman in the house) to get up like guys in the
street? For they all do. It has always puzzled me why
women, who are jealous when hubby unwisely enthuses
over the star’s toilet, don’t manage to let him see her by
daylight? The best-dressed women on the stage are
invariably the worst-dressed off—untidy slops and baggy
veils until you say, “ It can’t he she ! ” or, “it isn’t her!”
But it is “her ” invariably.
The inaugural ball in aid of the Fresh Air League took
place in the Centennial Hall on 30th ult., and was a
financial and social success, thanks to the generalship of
Dr. and Mrs. Mailler Kendall, who were leading spirits in
the affair. It’s too post mortem to detail the pretty-
dresses sported from Lady Jersey back again, but I cannot
forget one girl who sat out a dance or two on the cold,
marble staircase, with her swain one frozen step below'
her. A girl who can canoodle on a marble slab must have
surprisingly warm sentiments to keep her from feeling
like frozen mutton after ten seconds’ dalliance —don’t you
think so? The Fresh Air ball (it’s to be annual, by the
way) will echo down the corridors of time as the first ball
from which an all-wise committee made quite a tidy sum
by selling look-on-from-the-gallery tickets at a florin each.
School of Industry ball is to be plain and fancy this
year, and will eventuate at the Centennial Hall on 291 h
inst. Government House will be well represented on the
dais, and it is to be hoped that so deserving a charity—l
mean the School of Industry—will be benefited by a
bumper attendance.
Cardinal Moran moves with the times-die sanctions a
hall in aid of that excellent charity, Tempi) Refuge—and
has even throw n out a suggestion that a committee of
gentlemen lie formed to supplement the usual ladies’
ditto. So the ball is to be held, probably during July*
Formerly his Eminence (who is not a waltzing prelate) is
understood to have looked rather coldly on dancing
.charity-schemes, hut it’s just possible we may yet see
the red hat rotating to three-quarter time.
In the recent impersonating-an M.IVs-wife case it was
reported Hut the principal titled lady-witness (the
victim) concluded one portion of her evidence by saying;
“The accused, after cordially shaking hands with me,
departed.” Now-, it is my solemn conviction that if the
accused had curbed her longing to claw her dupe in
parting she wouldn’t be where she is now. Your average
knight’s wife laughs contemptuously at the nervous
impostress who ventures no further than the hall, and
tells her cock-and-bull story with awe and deference—
she is simply told to “ go along, my good woman ; we
don’t want no more of this,” by the flunkey, and there
are no police and no “ persecutions,” because she humbly
tried to work her poor, little, miserable swindle from the
kitchen, and not from the drawing-room standpoint, and*
as nobody’s amour propre suffers by it, she gets off scot
free. But the w'ell-pluckcd trickstress, who bounces into
my lady’s boudoir—poses easily on its sacred furniture as
she unwinds her plausible narrative, and ends her
infamous proceedings by actually shaking hands with her
victim !—well, when she is found out she hasn't the
shadow of a chance it the victim catches her. It isn’t
only the swindle that has to be avenged, it’s also the
“ howdy-do.” The charge-sheet (or whatever it is) ought
to he inscribed “crime aggravated by prisoner shaking
hands with Lady Blank.”
The funniest thing at N.S.W.’Art Society’s annual
conversazione this year was the stupid way in which Percy
Spence's pictured joke, “My Sweetheart when a Boy,”
was taken by the assembled folks. Spence drew a rococo
sort of lady—just the kind of middie-aged syren whom
small boys feel ready to die for—hut can you believe that
nobody saw it? Not even the daily papers next morning.
The enfant terrible is always cropping up, and the very
latest sample is a southern doctor’s very small son, who
borrows his father’s tall hat and goes about by himself
paying calls. He visited the bishop recently, and after a
formal reception got on to the lawn with the house-chil-
dren, with whom lie inaugurated anew game—standing
on their heads with his father’s heaver! Government
House came next on his list, and Lady Blank received him
and offered him refreshments, w hich he politely accepted,
and after munching through a cake naively remarked,
“ Ma’s a big story she says she never gets anything fit
to eat at Government House !” A chi Id like that would
have to he chained up if (here was a marriage in the
family.
Captain Sparrow (one of the dashing militairos sent to
F.nglaml to “tell at sight a chasso-pot rifle from a jave-
lin ” and all the rest of it) went through the matrimonial
manoeuvre with Miss Julia Owen, daughter of Major
Owen, of Bellanihi, at Wollongong the other Wednesday.
The “distiict” was in a frenzy of excitement, and the
bride wore the old style white wedding-gown. Honey-
moon in Brisbane.
With reference to a paragraph iu my letter last week,
Mr. Mario Majeroni directs my attention to the fact that,
as ho was not present at I lie Mayor and Mayoress’s
•'eception of Mrs. Bernard Beere, 1 must have mistaken
someone else for him.
An awful thing happened the other day to a couple just
about to marry. She w ent to get her pearly dentals over-
hauled to have everything ship-shape for the ceremony,
and as she was ushered into the dentist's surgery, behold,
her fiancee rose solemnly from the operating-chair.
That’s all.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.

At Sydney Garrick, on Saturday last, Mr.
Walter Bentley made his first bow to a Sydney
audience in the character of Hamlet. The - latest
representative of the Danish philosopher, whom
tlie daily press is at present engaged iu persistently
criticising as the ‘prince,” is a clean-cut, well-
built, admirably-proportioned man, with an easy
carriage, a good.stage presence, a bluff delivery,
and an intelligent, if not absolutely intellectual,
tout ensemble. There is sometimes a burr, or hard-
ness, in liis voice, reminiscent of the larboard
watch ahoy, but, taking him for all and all, he is
a worthier representative of Denmark’s high-born
pessimist than Sydney has had the good fortune
of becoming acquainted with-for a very long time.
1 lis version of “ Hamlet ” runs on the old, time-
honoured lines—with some new cuts—and he
appears to prefer a “ handsaw ”to a “ hernshaw,”
and a suit of “ sable” to a suit of “ scarlet.” He
moreover, neglects the “ mole ”in the ghost-scene
on the rampants of Elsinore, he omits the
“whale” and the “camel” in the Polonius
bantering, and the suggestive raillery in which
the Shakespearean original indulged with Rosen-
crantz and Guildenstern anent the stops of the
recorders, and a deal of other dear old familiar
business that cannot possibly be crowded into
three hours. Perhaps the play acts all the better
for the elisions, but custom hath made them in us
a property of easiness, and the hand of little
employment hath the daintier sense. One cut,
however, occasions to our mind some little con-
fusion—the throwing out of the scenes wherein
the banishment of Hamlet to England is rendered
emphatic, and hence, his re-appearance in the
grave-yard a necessary link in the logic of events
that lead up to the final catastrophe of the fifth
act. But one cannot
have everything, even in
Shakespearean drama.
* * #
From the rising of
the curtain till the fall
thereof, Mr. Bentley’s
characterisation was one
continuous success. The
play scene was a genuine
triumph, while the scene
with Ophelia, that with
the Queen, and the grave-
yard scene, fell little
short of it. When the
drop fell on the final
death-agony the house
rose as one man, and paid
Mr. Bentley the rare
compliment of missing
the last tram for the sake
of greeting hi 4 classic
features after 11 p.m. by
the clock. Neither was
“Hamlet” altogether a
one-man play. The star
was not indifferently
supported. The grave-
digger of Mr. Clitherow
was richly unctuous and
trad i tionally Shakes-
pearean. The King Clau-
dius of Mr. (t. A. Ireland
was like the good wine
that asketh no aid from
the proverbial sapling,
and was one of the best-
known performances of
that genuine actor. The
Poloniusof Mr. M‘( Iowan
was careful and conscien-
tious, and the Ghost of
Mr. South was an emin-
ently aristocratic goblin
with a Presbyterian sol-
emnity of demeanour, and
avoice foggily impressive.

enacted the parts respectively of Horatio and the
player King; but Mr. Harry Hill, who played
the former, must remember that the r6le is not
exhausted in mere picturesqueness of appearance,
and Horatio was rather Hamlet’s friend than his
lackey. Mr. J. B. Atholwood’s player King was
an admirable rendition of a small part, and ably
seconds bis recent success as Romeo to Miss Lily
Dampier’s Juliet. The Laertes of Mr. H. R.
Roberts was a cultivated and spirited piece of
work, and Miss May Ellis, as the player Queen,
gave earnest of better things to come. The Queen
Gertrude of the present version was sustained in
stately and artistic guise by Miss Watt-Tanner,
and the only actor who was reprehensibly bad was
the limelight man, wlrse fires were sepulohrally
gloomy, and whose glares were out of gear. Miss
Laura Hausen played Ophelia and she had only
a maniacal burst of exit laughter to recommend
her impersouatam. She is pretty, graceful,
pathetic oven; but she has not yet had 4he
experience to tit her for adequately enacting so
onerous a role. Moreover., she cannot sing the
mad music which tradition has assigned to the
daughter of sage Polonius.

At Sydney Royal one night last week
(Wednesday is becoming the fashionable “first
night” now) Mrs. Bernard-Bcero appeared as the
fascinating Irish hoyden actress, Peg Woffington,
in the brilliant old-style comedy in three acts, by
Tom Taylor and Charles Roade, yclept “ Masks
and Faces” —considerably adapted from the novel
of the last-mentioned collaborateur, and named
after the histrionic toast of old-time London. The
play, of course, belongs neither to the age of
Queen Anne nor to that of Queen Victoria, and it
takes a deal of illusion to make one swallow
it —after Congreve and the rest—ns a genuine
picture of Woffington’s dear old delirious days.
It has an occasional habit of reminding one
touchingly of “Tom Jones” with the warmth
cooled a.way by the bellows of Buchanan hut it
is, nathless, a good acting comedy, and it affords
a lot of scope for a real artiste like Mrs. Bccrc.
The drama in question appeals to the heart
which in romantic conrdy generally means the
green lushness of almost culpable inexperience ; in
Peg Woffington's case it m -aus wilful blindness,
which ultimately occasions her a bad heart ache,
and several people a deal of embarrassment. There
is, however, a lot of genuine pathos in “Masks
and. Faces,” and this, backed up by plum-eoloumi
coats with lappels, and the knee-breeches and
powdered wigs of a past age, draws much emotion
from the recalcitrant eyes of the cultivated peopß
who gather, on {esthetic considerations bent,
well-dressed circle on a select first night.
* » #
As the clover, refined, tricky, frolicsome,
humorous and sympathetic Irish actress, Peg
Woffington, Mrs. Beerc lias achieved her first pro-
nounced artistic triumph in Sydney. Whether
she is bandying witticisms with her Bohemian
comrades, exchanging love vows with Ernest
Vane, hurling sarcasm at Pomander, or pouring
out words of hope and encouragement to the
poetic family of Triplet, she is a dulcet joy and a
dream of everlasting delight. She is the play, the
whole play, and nothing but the play ; everybody
else could readily be dispensed with, except
Triplet—the pathetic old poet and painter and
woe-begone tragedian, whose thunders provoke
laughter and whose comedies move to tears. In
the hands of Mr. Herbert Standing, Triplet is a
delightfully natural character—Grub-street rc-
divivuis, with a voice whose every'tone and quaver
is a memory of Dr. Johnson and Chattertou
and Goldsmith and Savage; cow-heel for
supper, and a straw - bed for twopence in
a literary cellar. Mr, Marius plays the
part of Sir Charles Pomander. Possibly he
plays it well, but he makes Sir Charles appear to
have lived so long in Paris as to have forgotten
his native tongue, and to have transferred the
onus of expressing his thoughts to his eye-brows
and his shoulders. He looks well, dresses well—
but he is, nevertheless, M. Marius. As a Russian
police-magnate the Marius is colossal ; as an Eng-
lish buck of the Georgian period he is decidedly
out of it. Mr. J. F. Catheart ro-appears before a
Sydney audience in the character of Colley
Cibber ; and, good actor as Mr. Catheart is, he
cannot make us believe that Colley C. “ gang after
that gait.” Mr. Frank Emery as Snarl, Mr. Otho
Stuart as a pretty edition of Ernest Vane, Air.
Kemp as Quinn, and Mr. Guy Staunton as
Colander, assisted in many more or less material
directions to fill up more or less important in-
terstices in the piece, and the scenery was adequate
to the requirements thereof. In the character of the
neglected wife, Miss Isabelle Urquhart was a
pathetic vision of cream-clad loveliness, but for a
country-bred damsel she appeared far too elocu-
tionary. Miss Watson had a brilliant little pait
as Kitty Clive; and many other people fulfilled
jhe requirements of the minor characters of the
play with suffi.ient success to cause no serious
hitch. On Wednesday last “ Fedora ” succeeded
“ Masks and Faces,” of which a notice will appear
in next issue.

At Sydney Her Majesty’s the “Little
Jack Sheppard ” ta-ra boom is rushing along on
the flood-tide of success, but even elysium comes
to a full-stop sooner or later, and last nights of the
popular red-headed gaol-breaker are announced.
On Monday and Tuesday last Mr. Royce sang his
“Farewell” with a prophetic touchingness, and
heart-brokenly glodc away. On Wednesday Mr,
Harry Shine once again seized upon the ultra-
marine clothing of the ancient Blueskin, but all
the glory of Old Bailey disappears on Friday
night. On Saturday that charming little “ bell a
donna”— as the poet hath it— Miss Billi e Bar'ow,
bounds upon the festi'e boards in the gay and
riotous character of “Randolph the Reck’ess”—
“ prices as usual.”

At Sydney Critciiou Tuesday last saw the
final performance of the “Country Girl,” and on
Wednesday was produced the farcical comedy by
W. S. Gilbert, entitled “ Engaged,” in which Mr.
Boucicault appeared as Belvawney, Mr. Titlier-
adge as Cheviot Hill, Mr. Percy Lyndal as Angus
M'Alister, Mr. Lawrence as Symperson, Miss
Emma Temple as Belinda, Miss Brenda Gibson as
Maggie, and Miss Pattie Browne as Minnie. In
another week the house of comedy will be closed
for a season, and the place that knew the mum-
mers of drawing-room farce will know them no
more for a protracted period.

“ New Lamps for Old,” produced at Mel-
bourne Bijou on Saturday, is a social earthquake
in three acts, resulting in a peaceful resurrection
of the belief that marriage isn’t a failure. Far
above the crash of shattered ideals and the shriek
of a family solicitor dropping down, a well-hole
can be heard the voice of the author poking borak
at Mrs. Mona Caird, and advising young married
couples not to elope until they have found some-
thing rational to elope with. “New Lamps for
Old ” is not so much a hundred of bricks heaved
at Ibsen as a reckless destruction of a doctrine
that Mrs. Caird didn’t preach. J. K. Jerome, in
fact, supposes an impossible set of lunatics and
holds their madness up to nature in one of the
funniest farcical comedies that ever defied criticism.
The average elopement in stage married life is a
sad and sinful proceeding, the wages of which is a
long-drawn-out dissolution to the melancholy music
of muffled fiddles. Ou this occasion the husband
flies with a remorseless female who drags him along
by the collar whilst the wife leaves her happy
home for the sake of along-haired poet, and before
they have all started to honeymoon at the same
rural pub., something occurs to send them trotting
individually back to the place from which they
came. By which time they have discovered that
the double-barrelled elopement was a ghastly error
of judgment, inasmuch as the advanced divinity,
who intended to take the married man for a month
on trial, was still hungering for the poet who
wandered off with the wife, these twin invaders
of domestic peace having previously tried a sort
of spiritual eonnubiality for a month, and being
prepared to renew the contract. The common or
garden kind of married couple also perceive the
folly of not eloping with one another when they
feel disposed to fly, and the poet’s long hair turns
out to he a wig, and everything comes right with
the exception of the butler, who is deplorably
drunk at the finish, and the family solicitor, who
degenerates into a mark for universal scorn.
* * »
So involved is the absurdity, and so subtle
the best humour of Jerome’s dialogue that a first
performance of “New Lamps for Old” could
scarcely be expected to approach perfection, yet
the company of seven made an all-round success
on Saturday. Mr. Brough, as “ the great Postle-
thwaite,” managed to sink his own identity in the
character for a large portion of the time, and
Miss Ida Herbert, recently back from England,
played her original part of the strong-minded
Ootavia, with much vigour. Mrs. Brough and
Mr. Cecil Ward were sufficiently bright as the
pair of temporary lunatics, the lady, in particular,
warming to her work as she went along. The
’Kiah of “Uncles and Aunts” appeared again in
Mr. Cannam’s grotesque caricature of the family
solicitor, also Mr. Cambourne did well in the
capacity of old Jorkins, a butler who submits to
be “squared ” with cheerful resignation. The show
is put on in 8.8. style, and the vision of Cannain
travelling up and down the second act in the
dinner lift will be engraven on the heart* l of the
Bijou-going public for evermore.

The Italian operatists have completed a
triumphant run of “ Faust ’ at the Princess’s
without sounding any the worse for the strain on
their voices. Tenor Cuttioa even upset all antici-
pations by singing into form again, and has seem-
ingly found a gargle to soothe his larynx and
lubricate his upper register. On Wednesday, the
flow of music was to be maintained by a grand
concert, in which Miss Colbourne Baber and Alan
Morris upheld British interests, and this novel
experiment will be repeated on Friday. To-night
(Thursday) is set apart for another performance
of “ The Barber,” a brilliant success in the first
instance, and “Rigoletto,” with Melossi and
Cuttica at their strongest, may be ready by
Saturday.

“ Master and Man,” the story of a bad
man purified by not having to pass through the
furnace, was revived at Melbourne Royal on
Saturday. The Bulletin sat at the feet of this
powerful drama and poured its blessing on
Beelzebub, the bull-dog, only a few weeks back,
when Bland Holt & Co. were making the welkin
vibrate in Sydney. There is nothing left to say
about the solid excellence of “ Master and Man ”
as an exhibition of acting, scenery, stage-manage-
ment and canine sagacity. The show is Good,
with a gigantic G. There are flies above the stage
but none on the performance which has mellowed
and gained in strength since Beelzebub made his
Melbourne debut at the Alexandra. Mrs. Bland
Holt is a brighter ray of sunshine than ever, and
others too numerous to be sugared in detail are as
they were, or even more so. Charles Glenny gets
inside the misanthropic hunchback as easily ns he
slipped into the magnanimous tar, and the leading
lacly is never twice alike. One night she is Kate
Bishop and the next she is Edith Blande. Busi-
ness deserves to be big at the Royal where
“Master and Man,” by the way, must be seen
quickly or not at all. It will retire immediately
at the sound of “ The Trumpet Call,” they say.

The Australian equivalent for “chappie”
continues to storm the Opera House in large
quantities, and the deah girls gather in their
vegetable tributes with much success. “Faust
Up to Date ” would seem to fill that moss-grown
vacuum, the good old “ long-felt want,” therefore
the individual who finds little delight in the latest
edition of the Gaiety Company can retire into the
background and pray for Divine assistance until
he finds more. The persevering Lonnen intro-
duced what was generally accepted .as a brilliant
idea on Saturday. After Alice Leamar had given
them “Ta-ra-ra,” &c., the gentleman bounded on
in skirts and sang two more verses, one of which
sparkled with the suggestion that the audience
“ought to see me booze.” This parody, though
certainly cheap and not very chaste in design, was
so.evidently suited to all classes present that
imagination can’t picture the result of a similar
performance by “Lady” Munro. A fortune is
sticking out in her ladyship for any hall that will
take the hint. “ Faust Up to Date ”is sentenced
to another week, and will do it easily.

Mr. Dainpiev’s lease of Melbourne Alex-
andra expires this week. The company are pre-
paring for a long march into the interior, and the
gods cast tear-dimmed sheep’s-eyes at Lily, as at a
loved one about to be called away. On Saturday
last the farewell season was inaugurated with a
serio-comic Irish drama, “Help One Another.’
The warm-hearted young patriot loomed large as
usual, the wicked squire gave further proofs of his
everlasting infamy, and the noble-hearted colleen
asserted herself to great advantage. Likewise,
the grand old priest was there to remind them of
their immortal sowls, and the performance, led by
Dampier in person, gave satisfaction to all.
“ Help One Another ” may wind up the season,
but it is to be hoped that an old favourite won’t
farewell in too much of a hurry, or forget to revive
himself in an assortment of popular characters
before closing his honourable reign at the Haleck.

Brisbane play-goers have had an oppor-
tunity of seeing how the new man Lauri shapes in
some of Elton’s principal parts. Last week the
Royal Comic Opera crowd put up “Dorothy”
and “lolanthe” with “Charity Begins at Home”
as an after-piece. In the former Lauri played
Lurcher, and in “Charity” &e. he essayed Joe.
In both lie gave a dead copy of the immortal and
agile William of pious memory ; but the new man
pans out too much fat to the ton to be original.
Up to date there is but one Elton, and Lauri is
not his prophet, “lolanthe” seems to grow in
grace as the years go by, and Violet Varley is a
gladsome vision of a mother whose alleged age
tots up some 200 years or so. Elsie Cameron,
through sickness, had to be replaced by Mabel
Mac Kay, as the Fairy Quetn. For a wonder the
brass band which brings on the effete upper house
was in good form, and business has been good.
Brisbane is not such a ruined community as it
looks to the casual eye.

Miss Laura Hausen, whose portrait appears
in this issue, is a young lady who has had a
successful career in England, for several years
past, during which time she has played—under
the Messrs. Gattis’ management—all the leading
feminine parts in “Harbour Lights,” “Union
Jack,” and other dramas. Her greatest success
was in the graceful character of Dora Vane in the
“Harbour Lights,” which she played for over
18 months in the English provinces and
in London. She later on appeared for 12
months at the London Garrick in the com-
pany of Mr. John Hare, taking the lead-
ing part in “A Pair of Spectacles.” At latest
Miss Hansen, after a long and prosperous tour
through Australasia with Mr. Walter Bentley’s
company, was playing Ophelia to that gentleman’s
Hamlet in Sydney.

When old Joe Tolano ran the Lyceum in York-street,
Sydney, years ago, he was one evening, “ ash vos hish
cushtom,” standing at the dress-circle entrance to welcome
the coming guest. To his intense amazement a smart
carriage drove up, from which alighted two ladies of the
high ton. They speedily found they had made a mistake,
were bound for the Masonic Hall, where the
oratorio “Judas Maccabteus” was being performed, and
they accordingly bowled off again. Joe was relating the
incident a few minutes afterwards to George Morton, who
said in his usual dry way, “ A very natural mistake, Joe.
They saw you at the door, and took you for Judas.”
Janet Aohurch and her hubby (says our London'corres-

alter that name, no Scot would attend his lecture. He
altered it.

Frank Oates, we regret to hear, is laid up in the Alfred
Hospital, Melbourne, where he lately underwent an
operation. He was to have played in the “Country Girl,”
but his health compelled him to resign from the service of
B. &B. He has had an offer for the new venture at
Sydney Opera House on 18th inst., but it is doubtful
whether he will then have sufficiently recovered.
“ I hear from very good authority,” writes a Bulletin
correspondent, “ that Sir Arthur Sullivan is not likely to
recover from bis present illness. He may possibly get
better for a time, but it will be only a flicker of life’s
candle, which is nearly burned out. The clever Montagu
Williams is also seriously ill, and little hopes are enter-
tained of his recovery.”

A coaching item from the history of Kyrle Bellew, as
told by Mrs. Brown-PotterThere have been many
instances of strange misfortune, and no end of heart-
breaking contrasts in this world—Marie Antoinette on the
scaffold, Beau Brummel in a Boulogne garret, Napoleon
on St. Helena, and Rutherford B. Hayes raising chickens
in Fremont, Ohio, for example—but it is to be doubted if
the world in all its changeful history has known so
pathetic an instance of calamitous reversal of circum-
stances as that related in London the other day by Mrs.
James Brown-Potter, when confiding her experiences in
South Africa to an agitated reporter. One afternoon in
Capetown the theatre was burned down, and with it a
good portion of Mrs. Potter’s wardrobe and all of Mr.
Kyrle Bellew’s. “As a rule,” said the lady, her own fine
eyes moistening at the recollection, “ I don’t like to see a
man cry, but my heart went out to Kyrle as he stood and
watched his c'o'.hes go, while the big tears rolled down
•his cheeks.” Rugged, indeed, must have been the heart,
either of woman or man, which could have witnessed that
scene unmoved. But terribly tragic as was this situation,
it Jbecame by comparison mere comedy to that which
followed when the manager—a gross, commercial brute,
with a soul not above the box-office—hired a hall and
instructed the company to go on the improvised stage in
their ordinary clothes, everybody’s stage rags having
gone up in smoke. Mr. Bellew’s role forbade trousers
absolutely—he must wear tights or the dramatic unities
would be dynamited. The manager, troglodyte as he
was, had not the hardihood to approach Mr. Bellew with
the proposition which suggested itself to his coarse
mind; so he went to Mrs. Potter and proposed—
as she phrased it in her own delicate way to the
reporter—that “Kyrle might be accommodated with
a pair of tights improvised from men’s underclothing
stretched and dyed.” She behaved like a real
lady, for, to continue her chaste narrative: —“ I decided
not to wound Mr. Belfew’s feelings by repeating this pro-
position, but on the following day the manager insisted
that Mr. Bellew and the other members of the company
should provide themselves with gentlemen’s underwear
instead of tights, and resume playing. When this pro-
position was made to Mr. Bellew, he rejected it with
indignation and horror.” The management went so far in
attempting compromise as to offer to pay for Mr. Bellew’s
underclothing, but, backed by the now thoroughly
aroused Mrs. Potter, he refused, and they left. Thus was
a notable service to history rendered, and the dignity of
the dramatic profession maintained. For many hearts
would have ached had Kyrle Bellew appeared on the
stage in an outfit of South African gent’s underwear
—Kyrle Bellew, who but a few years ago turned
the heads of whole battalions of New York’s
most intelligent and modest women of society,
who sought to give to his delicate and fascinating
manly beauty woman’s ennobling and refining influence
by hanging around the stage-door to get a glance from
him as he came out of the theatre. And Mrs. James
Brown-Potter, too—how could she have looked upon the
underwear and lived ?—this one-time flower of Baltimore’s
and New York’s drawing-rooms, who, after making the
acquaintance of “’Ostler Joe” and the brandy of noto-
riety, acquired a distaste for the lemonade of social
triumphs, and forsook all for art and Kyrle Bellew, in-
cluding her husband and child. But how unromantic a
Romeo would Kyrle have made, sighing beneath his
Juliet’s balcony in pajamas!— Argonaut.
Schumann, when in the first stages of insanity, was

servatorium, is now haunted by the same note. She
resigned her position in the hope of getting away from it,
but it has followed her into private life, and unless she

lish railway carriage, is a LL.D. and High Sheriff
for the county of Meath. He toured Australasia
with his wife three years ago.
The Victorian Ministry, pursuing its
retrenchment policy, has ordered that Civil ser-
vants with salaries under .£250 shall travel second-
class on departmental business. The officers resent
the proposal. What special virtue is there, we
wonder, in .£251 per year ?
The attitude of Berry and Deakin towards
one another during the Victorian Railway Com-
missioners-removal debate tended more than ever
to show that a coalition between them looms
ahead. Deakin waits his chance, and Berry is
waiting for Deakin.
It is now quite evident that the N.S.W.
Public Works Committee should be elected by
open voting. Frankenstein, the elector, must be
allowed to see how his monster works in every
detail. The Works Committee elections by secret
ballot have up to date been fruitful in sectarian
and other paltry conspiracies and in organised
breaches of faith, and at least one man has been
elected for whom it is safe to say many of his
supporters would not have dai'ed to vote openly.
Dear Bulletin :—lsn’t it about time that
the country shut down on that canting politician
who always states that the thing he doesn’t
approve of is “ inimical to the best interests of the
country?” If this phrase could be buried, along
with the “ right-thinking person ” who is always
dragged in as evidence when the “Constitution”
requires to be propped up, the nation would feel
a great deal better. Yours &c.— Wrong-thinking
Person.
History repeats itself in every direction.
Any captain who brings Chinese to Australia is
responsible for the .£lOO a head poll-tax in the
event of their landing unauthorisedly. The other
day a couple of Chinese firemen escaped from a
French vessel at Newcastle, and it is alleged that
the captain, who went in pursuit and ostensibly
recovered them, merely caught a couple of other
Chinamen and induced them to temporarily fill
the places of the deserters. This recalls the story
of the N.Q. policeman whose two Chinese prisoners
escaped him, and who calmly went and handcuffed
a couple of other yellow men, and brought them
along to the lock-up.
Commissioner Eddy is an energetic,
nervous, sensitive, irritable man who thinks
quickly and too much, and lies awake o’ nights,
and gets nasty when he’s over-worried—and when
a man has two commissions enquiring into his con-
duct, and a couple of railway-accidents to settle
up, and a big railway system to manage, and
arrears of work accumulating all the time, he is
apt to feel that he has on his shoulders a bigger
load than he can bear for long. Mr. Eddy should
studiously avoid crossing swords with his critics
and enemies in public, and should leave that busi-
ness to a fat man like Commissioner Fehon, who
can swear genially, and who, as he has no “ per-
sonal dignity ” and doesn’t dress too carefully,
or in an English professional manner, is privi-
leged to tell Australian people of all sorts,
without offence, exactly what he thinks of them in
a bluff, to-the-devil-with-you sort of way. Mr.
Hoyle, as a fat man without gall, should have a
great advantage over Commissioner Eddy in
public encounters, and in the recent trouble he
failed to utilise his opportunities.
The Victorian membership of the Austra-
lian Institute of Journalists rapidly approaches

Gresley Lukin is, we regret to hear, lyiiiy
sick in a private hospital at Brisbane. Cause-
sciatica.
Last Saturday morning that unlucky man,
Thomas Walker, M.L.A., was drunk in a railway-
carriage at Sydney, While in that condition he
seems to have started fumbling with a revolver,
and in the course of his wobblings, it would
appear, the weapon went off and shot) Rev. David
Laseron in the back. The owner of the revolver
apparently didn’t even know that his weapon had
gone off, and sat gazing at it in a fatuous manner
until he was arrested, when he woke up and
“scrapped” promiscuously with everybody. As
Walker is a Protectionist, and has fought some
tough battles in the labour-interest, the Sydney
Daily Telegraph reports the case as follows :
An unprecedented shooting affray took place in a rail-
way carriage as it was passing through the yards at
lledfern early on Saturday afternoon, in which Mr. Thomas
Walker, M.P. for Northumberland, shot at and severely
wounded the Rev. David Laseron, incumbent of St.
George’s Anglican Church, Glenmore-road, Paddington.
The victim now lies at the Prince Alfred Hospital with
the bullet embedded in the fleshy part of the hack, below
the left shoulder-bl d while his assailant is confined at
the Redfern police station.
This, on the face of it, appears to be an utterly
unfair and malicious attempt to create a prejudice
against Walker. Firstly, there was less “affray ”
in the matter than there was when Sir Henry
Parkes fell out of a cab and broke his leg.
Secondly, it has not been shown that Walker
“shot at” Mr. Laseron; the evidence so far all
got s to show that Walker was absolutely intoxi-
cated, and didn’t even know that he was shooting.
Thirdly, he was not an “assailant,” but a drunk.
Thomas Walker is also one of the most unfor-
tunate drunks going. It was just like his evil
luck to pot a preacher at the first shot, for his
criticisms of the clergy have been so rough that
half the community will take it for granted that,
though he may not have intended to shoot the
reverend gentleman, yet, had he made up his
mind to wipe out somebody, he would have
enthusiastically selected a parson as his target.
The Rev. Mr. Laseron had not, at time of writing,
got rid of the bullet.
The new home of the Victorian Artists
Society, Albert-street, Melbourne, is somewhat
suggestive of the brilliant tourist suit in which
Mr. Dorritt, junr., started to “do” Switzerland.
The universe, according to Charles Dickens,
wasn’t capable of providing travel commensurate
with the requirements of young Dorritt’s costume.
Victoria doesn’t yet produce art sufficient to come
up to that imposing gallery—albeit, the winter
exhibition of 300 odd works in oil and water-
colour, supported by a small collection of statuary,
cannot be honestly sneezed at. The most preten-
tious and popular picture on view is “ The Death
of Burke,” by Arthur Loureiro. This is a big
subject on a big canvas. Wills, gaunt, emaciated,
but not pathetic in his misery, sits at the feet of
the dead Burke in the foreground of a crushed-
strawberry desert. The picture doesn’t appal an
ordinary spectator, and it is easier to see paint
than to feel nature in the general effect. Douglas
Richardson contributes several productions of the
cranky school, intended, doubtless, to be lofty in
conception, yet suggesting nothing beneath the
unlovely surface. For example, “ A Nereid ” is
the back-view of a scraggy, squatting, nude figure
who holds out a garfish to a flock of flying sea-
gulls. A strip of impossibly yellow beach and
another strip of pea-green sea are laid across the
floor of this work. There is no health in it.
“ The Kiss of Death,” by the same artist, strikes
one as being a soulless imitation of a strong idea,
and the stupid face of the bloated infant who is
supposed to be passing lienee excites ridicule any-
way. Charming little landscapes and mountain
scenes, by J. Mather—pictures that carry their
own atmosphere about with them, and persuade
the observer that he is out of town—are plentiful,
and specially attractive at their moderate cata-
logue prices. J. F. Paterson’s “Winter on the
Murray Flats ” must please everybody by its
artistic dealing with nature in a gloomy mood.
“Oh, the Dreary, Dreary Moorland!” (Louis
Grier) is, on the other hand, a picture in which
nobody outside the profession can see more than a
5 x4ft. expanse of grey and yellow agony. You
can’t swear to the Moorland, or the clouds, or to
anything except the dreary coating of paint. An
incongruous picture by Catani shows much pretty
work and mixed ambition. A bold-faced female,
with next to nodings on, flaunts her excellent
flesh tints against a dark forest background
calculated to set the young woman off to advant-
age. Two black swans, in a refreshing piece of
winding stream, have sailed up to the bank on
which she stands and seem to be wondering what
this essentially Melbourne nymph does in the
wilds of W. A. Catani calls her a Prophetess out
of an old legend, but the swans know better. She
ought to dress herself and go back to the bar. She
is a nice girl—a little out of balance and at vari-
ance with the canons of art, no doubt, but quite
real and enchanting when studied in little bits at
a time. Arthur Streeton lias some slap-dash
works in which it is hard to find the excellence at
a glance; some oil and water-colour portraits by
Tennyson Cole are fully up to his established
reputation, also “ A Creek of the Ovens ” (J. C.
Waite) calls for special mention in a notice that
doesn’t profess to be more than casual. G. R.
Ashton has a capital, easy standing figure of a
man-o’-warsman reading The Bulletin on the
gun-deck, a picture at once strong as regards the
bronzed sailor and unsatisfactory in much of the
colouring of the accessories. Entitled “Articles
of War” it is commendably peaceful in purpose.
The Jingo spirit finds vent in “ Rumours of War ”
by A. Colquhoun. This is a deplorable wooden-
looking picture of a sailor reading out a cable lie
from the ’Erald, the scene being laid apparently
in the back parlour of a pub. A mounted rifle-
man looks over the sailor’s shoulder, whilst a
valiant volunteer sits on the table and thirsts for
gore. Meantime a girl is bringing long beers on a
tray in the distance. The production is injurious
in sentiment and ought to be turned face to the
wall.

“ If the N.S.W. Government die, they will
die gamely, and come up smiling.”—Minister
Slattery.
Taxpayer : If we don’t get pensions our-
selves, why should we subscribe for pensions for
other people ?
Dr. Cockburn has been dropped by some
of the S.A. Oppositionists, who are anxious to get
him out of the way by making him Speaker.
The Adelaide branch of the Australian
Natives’ Association is moribund. Politics and
everything lively are interdicted at its meetings.
Dear Bulletin, — You ask: “Has any
Irish-Australasian- politician, barring Ballance,
ever refused a title?” Yes—Peter Lalor.— Anon.
J. M. Stuart, S.A. Crown Prosecutor, was
once a policeman, and formed one of Inspector
Tolmer’s famous gold escort in the old Bendigo
days.
The real reason of Parkes’ anti-slavery
letter probably was that the N.S.W. Ministry’s
special organ apologises for the Kanaka-catching
business.
The Dibbs Government is now known as
the “ Country Government Mr. Barton, Q.C.,
being the only member representing a metropolitan
constituency.
Grahamßerry’sfirstspeech in the Assembly
was dead against Speight and Co. He hinted
darkly at paying them compensation, and the
Assembly listened hungrily for more, but Berry
was silent suddenly.
A certain Sydney daily always mixes its
Freetrade and Anti-Unionist opinions with the
news it furnishes to iuterprovincial papers in Mel-
bourne and Adelaide.
The whirligig of time brings its revenges.
Parkes now righteously denounces the cheap-
imported-nigger system. But who was it im-
ported cheap half-nigger compositors?
Though Germans control the voting in
half-a-dozen double-member constituencies there
are only three Germans in the S.A. Parliament,
one of them being the Attorney-General.
The first measure passed in the old Parlia-
ment of Canterbury (M.L.) when it met in 1853,
was a humble document providing that the pro-
vince should borrow not more than £2OO for three
months at eight per cent.
Parkes’letter “Parleying with Slavery”
appeared in Sydney Daily Telegraph alone.
From which it is quite evident that the old man
did not send it to the S. M. Herald, a pro-
slavery organ, by the way.
The working-men suburbs of Melbourne
did not roll up well this year with the electoral
suffrage shilling—which is not surprising, for they
have been practically disenfranchised in gloho by
the Specification of Rolls Act.
In Toohoy v. Melville the N.S.W. Full
Court has decided that the chairman of com-
mittees has power to order a member to be
removed from the chamber even without a pre-
vious resolution of the House to that effect.
If Chief Justice Lilley should decide to
cast aside his robes of office it is more than likely
that Sam. Griffith will be invited (by himself) to
occupy the vacant seat. And if such a thing
comes to pass, how Judge Harding will snort!
Baker, M.L.A., claims consideration for
the dethroned Speight from the Victorian As-
sembly as “Britishers, fathers of families, and as
men.” This is aggravating ! When are we going
to be Australians, and have some virtues of our
own to swear by ?
Kingston, until lately the chief S.A.
democrat, now sports a Windsor uniform and says
nice things about the Governor. Once he proudly
stalked round in the scarlet of a sergeant of
militia and hurled invectives against Kintore
from his place in Parliament.
Land monopoly! There are in little
Tasmania 170 private properties of over 5000
acres, the aggregate being 1,981,220 acres. The
acreage of one property alone reaches 199,000,
that of another 142,000, whilst the average for 146
owners is something like 10,000 acres each !
Cabled that the Orangemen of Ireland are
preparing to rebel in the event of Home Rule.
They threatened the same when Catholic Emanci-
pation and Church Disestablishment were coming,
but quietly accepted the inevitable. Nowadays
there is more bark than bite about King Billy.
Another try for Women’s Suffrage will be
made in South Australia this session, and it is
sure to come with next Parliament. The Lower
House in 1890 passed the Bill by the requisite
absolute majority, but in the Council, although it
got the votes of exactly half the members, another
vote was wanted.
The N.S.W. Ministry lost the Bogan
election, which resulted in the return of Squatter
A’Beckett, apparently through their indisposition
to support Labour-member O’Halloran, on the
ground that he was not sufficiently high-toned.
The Ministry are erring dreadfully in this matter
of tone —so think many of the best Protectionists.
( Ihe Australasian Governments move the
Colonial Office to take the prerogative of mercy
out of the hands of the Governor and place it in
those of tho_ Executive Council for the time
being. This is an outcome of the Mount Rennie
case—of the hard hearted soft-headedness of the
“ downy ” Governor Carington, who allowed four
untried but convicted boys to be strung up in a
row.
The proposal of the Playford Government
to refer the coolie labour question to an Australian
Conference confirms recent rumours that they
want to back out of the job to which the blunder-
ing Playford tried to commit them. Kingston’s
democratic West Adelaide constituents won’t
listen to cheap labour ideas, and the nominal
S.A. Premier has, therefore, promptly put his big
foot on the £3 per annum nigger.
Several members of S.A. Parliament are
interested in a big land-grant railway scheme
which is to unite Oodnadatta with Pine Creek.
The distance to be traversed is 1000 miles, and the
country to be grabbed can be counted by millions
of acres. Parsons, once Government Resident of
the Northern Territory, is very anxious to get
Parliamentary consent to the undertaking, as also
to the introduction of niggers into the Territory.
If the Opposition should muster up the 27
votes needed to turn out the Playford (S.A.)
Ministry, it is said the new team will consist of
Holder, Premier and Treasurer ; Gordon, M.L.C.,
Attorney-General; Cockburn, Education ; Stock,
Chief Secretary ; Handyside, Crown Lands ; and
THE DIVINE AFFLATUS.
“I have immortal longings in me now.” — SHAKESPEARE.
SHOP-BOY : “Please, sir, I want to leave!”
JONES : “Why, my boy?”
SHOP-BOY : “’Cos Mr. Rignold wants me to be a corpse in ‘Henry V.’; and he says he’ll
gimme a bob a week more’n you do.”
Moule, Public Works, with Osman as whip. The
progressive land-tax is to be severely boycotted,
and if Cookburn will not submit to that he is to be
dropped.
The British man-of-war. Goldfinch, has
gone to the Chatham Islands with the fell purpose
of collecting dog-tax. For several years past, the
Maoris at the Chathams have assumed a martial
attitude and declined to pay, and now the Gold-
finch is going either to get the money or bombard
the dogs. All the dogs in the archipelago
wouldn’t pay the cost of the expedition, but the
dignity of the empire must bo kept up, no matter
what the bill amounts to.
“ If Foreign-trade were totally blocked to-
morrow,” says the Brisbane Worker, “ there
would be sweating in Victoria to-morrow night,
and don’t let the Victorians forget it.” Quite
true. And if Protection were abolished to-
morrow the result would be exactly the same,
also if the Chinese were wiped out this afternoon
there would probably be alligators in the northern
rivers before evening. There is no earthly con-
nection between tariffs and sweating, anyhow.
Here is a significant commentary on the
unblushing Foreign-trade theory that a Protective
duty is merely so much added to the price to the
consumer, so that a 25 percent, tariff on an article
costing Is. at once raises the price to Is. 3d. In
Victoria, imported oats, by reason of the heavy
duty, cost 3s. 4d., yet the price of Victorian oats
is only 2-i. 4d. Imported barley, which also
carries a heavy duty, costs ss. 9d. landed in Mel-
bourne, but the Victorian farmer, instead of
running his' price up to ss. 9d., only charges
3s. lOd. Imported maize would cost 4s. GJd., and
yet Victorian maize is sold for 2s. lOd. ; and
potatoes could not be imported under £l3 a ton,
but the local artiple sells for 20s. or 30s. All the
same, Sydney Daily Telegraph will come out
to-morrow with the same haggard wail about the
way Protection adds 25 per cent, to the price of
provisions, and its readers will probably believe
the statement. If you say a thing often enough,
you can always get someone to believe it.
Parkes’ lament that the whole of th e
N.S.W. Ministry are “deserters from Freetrade,”
reminds The Bulletin that the chief cause of
Parkes’ political decadence is the division for the
first time of the N.S.W. Assembly into two real
political and not merely personal factions. If
Parkes had sat on the fiscal fence he would have
been powerful to the last—would have been able
at the critical moment to step down, as he had
ever done, and join the stronger side. But his
’Ome prejudices and traditions were too strong
for him.
The composition of the Ballance (M.L.)
Cabinet does not exalt the Englishman as
a politician. The Premier is an Irish-
man ; Attorney-General Buckley is also Irish;
M‘Kenzie, Minister of Lands, is Scotch; Ward,
Postmaster-General; Reeves, Minister of Educa-
tion ; and Cadman are all three Maorilanders; and
Seddon, Minister of Works, is the only English-
man in the crowd. It is the same everywhere.
The leading Englishmen are almost all Scotch and
Irish, and they keep getting more Scotch and
more Irish every day.
The Griffith Government has decided that
the old case-hardened slavers who acted as
Government Agents in the Kanaka trade in former
days shall have the first appointments, now that the
industry has been revived. This is melancholy.
The traffic was to be washed and boiled and made
clean, but this digging up of the ancient ruffians
most of whom cared for no rules or regulations—
who lived riotously among the Polynesian girls,
and drank furiously when on board, and had
delirium tremens when on shore, and whose whole
career was one long burst of unmitigated black-
guardism, is a promising beginning.
Sydney D.T. published last Monday an
interview with a wandering American—seemingly
of no special importance—named Wallace F.
Kirk, and tried very hard to dig out from him
some remarks favourable to Foreign-trade. These
are what it got. (1) Harrison (the Republican and
cast-iron Protectionist nominee) will undoubtedly
beat Cleveland (Democrat, with alleged Foreign-
trade leanings) for the Presidency. (2) The Re-
publicans are followers of M‘Kinley. (3) Under
Harrison’s administration (when Protection has
been more rigid than it ever was before) the
country has been “ exceptionally prosperous ” —in
fact it has “never been more prosperous than
now.” But all the same (despite the certain
triumph of the ultra-Protectionist party afid the
prosperity which has accompanied their policy)
* ‘ the wiser heads desire a tariff for revenue purposes
only ” (which is another name for Freetrade) and
“ the next Congress will insist on an entire
revision of the tariff ”in that direction. What a
hash !

The other clay a man was found dead in a

The. Bishop of Durham has saved the
English Church establishment, by settling the
difference between the nobility and the colliers
No longer will the colliers grudge him his .£10,000

wide Granville mouths.
With Fitzgibbon off to England, lively as
a grig, the sexagenarian Victorian Civil Servants
point their morals. They cut capers to show how
they are as lively as he, and want to know why
they are to be pensioned off. Every service has
its ghoul—the man who is the envious under-
study, always wanting to know why somebody else
don’t die.
Pall Mall Gazette, .which (following
Stead’s lead) has become almost an organ of Mark
borough House, remarks that one of the most
gratifying results of the visit of the Prince and
Princess of Wales to Cap Martin is that the
illustrious couple “ have seen much more of each
other than had been the case for some time
previously.” Nasty,
A certain K.O.M.G. now holding a bi»
official position in England, is a J.P. of
and formerly sat on the bench of a certain country
town with much regularity. On one occasion he
had before him an aborigine charged with
drunkenness. There was no doubt about the fact,
and all the darkey could do was to appeal for pity
and promise not to offend again. “ Blease not
bin senna me longa lookup. You bin led me co
Missa . I bin parromise nebba get tarrunk
again. I bin go takit beledge longa parson
Hassall.” But all his pleading was in vain, for he
was a noted nuisance in the township when drunk.
Finding that he could not appease his worship, he
went on the other tack, and pointing his finger at
the magistrate, said: “You no bin led me go?
All right you plurry jew, what for you hin killum

The Canterbury (M.L.) Times man muses
about Deeming just before the execution :—
And where is Deeming all this time? Most likely writing
a history, full of lies and piety. I would not at all be
surprised at hearing that he repented of his iniquity at
last. Burgess, of the brutal Sullivan gang, did so. I
remember pitching the book into the fire, and so sending
so much nauseating cant up the chimney. It was he who
took poor little old Jimmy Battle into the bush and
choked him for threepence. I heard that Burgess went to
Heaven afterwards. I do not know where poor Battle
went to. Burgess gave him no time to repent. Nor did
Deeming give any of his victims any time to make their
peace with their Maker. I have heard numbers of persons
say that hanging was too good for Deeming. And so it is
—if there be no place of eternal torment. But if there be
such a place, what gluttons for punishment must those
people be who would like to see him dancing on a hot
griddle every day for months before he is hung 1 No one,
really, seems able to say whether there is or is not such a
place as the region alluded to. I never hear the locality
referred to at all now, except by the Salvation Army. One
would like to know whether it is still existent, or whether
it is to be regarded as a bank of clouds, very heavy and
threatening in the morning, but dissipated by the noon-
day ? I went into the kitchen just now to light my pipe.
The girl there, I found, had fastened a supplement of the
Canterbury Times containing views of Deeming’s resi-
dence at Rainhill, and other illustrations connected with
the man, to the wall. She stood before the picture and
was examining it attentively. I asked her what she was
doing. She said she was wondering at it. “Wondering
about what? ” I asked. “ Wondering,” said she, “ how a
man could do such things—and him having such a
beautiful villa to live in! ”
The Mechanism of Man.
A man has within him a working pump called his
heart, a working; bellows called his lungs, a work-
ing vat called his stomach, a working condenser
called his brain, and a working evaporator called
his skin, all of which must be at work whether he
will or not. The heart is expending over his
body day by day, 122 foot-tons of work. He will
go on lifting so many millions of tens in so many
years. If he meet with no accident, the time will
come when his last stroke will be finished and he
will die, or he may be carried off in earlier life by
disease, which, however slight in its early stages,
works like a ferment. The symptoms may be
scarcely noticeable—a little laziness, slight head-
aches or backaches—but the cause is always at
work. Take a handsome, rosy-cheeked young
man, full of life and hope, let a germ of disease enter
his system, it is invisible, too small to be weighed;
judged by the evidence of the senses it is too
insignificant to be thought of, hut it extends in-
definitely. It may be months, it may be years,
but if the first symptoms are neglected the deadly
disorder will do its fatal work ; the step loses its
elasticity, the eyes become dull, the cheeks pale,
strength departs, and eventually the joyous youth
is but a shell, a cadaverous, shrunken form, and
death ends the dreadful scene. With such facts
staring us daily in the face how careful ought we
to be that the first warning voice of nature should
be heeded, and that when we suffer those tired,
aching feelings, nervous headaches, neuralgia, and
other signs of approaching catastrophe we should
have trust in that great regenerator of vital
strength, Clements Tonic, which positively restores
pristine health to every organ of the body, as
instanced in the following case: “In justice to
the value of Clements Tonic I wish to add my
testimony to its efficacy. My daughter has for
several years been afflicted with torturing head-
aches and complete prostration, for which she
tried numerous remedies to no purpose. At
length a friend sent her a bottle of Clements
Tonic, and a few doses gave such relief that she_
will hear of no other remedy; and other persons in'
my household, who have been similarly afflicted,
have the same faith in its properties. W. E.
Murtagh, Mitta Mitta, Vic.” The above was
declared before me at Mitta Mitta. in the North-
ern Bailiewick of Victoria, this 2nd day of October,

Arvie Aspinall’s Alarm Clock.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I.
In one of these years a paragraph appeared in a
daily paper to the effect that a constable had dis-
covered a little hoy asleep on the steps of Grinder
Bros.’ big factory at 4 o’clock one rainy morning.
The constable woke the hoy and demanded an
explanation.
The little fellow explained that ho ‘ worked
there and was “frightened of being late”; he
“ started wirk at six,” and was apparently greatly
astonished to hear that it was only four. Ihe
constable examined a small paper parcel which
the poor, frightened child carried in his hand.
The parcel contained a clean apron and three
slices of “ bread-and-treacle.”
The child further explained that he woke up
and thought it was late, and didn’t like to wake
“mother” and ask her the time “ because she’d
been washin’.” He didn’t look at the clock,
because they “ didn’t have none.” He volunteered
no explanation as to how he expected “mother”
to know the time, hut, perhaps, like many other
mites of his kind, he had unbounded faith in the
infinitude of a mother’s wisdom. His name was
Arvie Aspinall, please sir, and he lived in Jones’
Alley. Father was dead.
A few days later the same paper took great
pleasure in stating-in reference to that “Touch-
ing Incident” —noticed in a recent issue—that a
benevolent society lady had started a subscription
among her friends with the object of purchasing
an alarm clock for the little hoy found asleep at
Grinder Bros.’ workshop door.
Later on, it was mentioned, “in connection with
the touching incident, that the alarm-clock had
been bought and delivered to the hoy’s mother,
who appeared to be quite overcome with gratitude.
We learn, also, from another sourc". that the
last assertion was greatly exaggerated j|
The touching incident was worn out in another
paragraph, which left no doubt that the benevo-
lent society lady was none other than a charming
and accomplished daughter of the house of
Grinder.
11.
It was late in the last day of the Easter holi-
days, during which Arvie Aspinall lay in bed with
a bad cold. He was still what he called “croopy.”
It was about mine o’clock, and the business of
Jones’ Alley was in full swing.
“That’s better, mother, I’m better far,” said
Arvie, “ the sugar and vinegar cuts the phlegm,
and the hothrin’ cough gits out.” It got out to
such an extent for the next few minutes that he
couldn’t speak. When he recovered his breath,
he said ;
“Better or worse, I’ll haveter go to work to-
morrow, in any case. Gimme the clock, mother.”
“ I tell you, you shall not go ! It will be your
death.”
“ It’s no use talking, mother ; we can’t starve—
and—sposin’ somebody got my place ! Gimme
the clock, mother.”
“I’ll send one of the children round to say
you’re ill. They’ll surely let you off for a day ox-
two. ”
“ ’Taint no use ; they won’t wait; I know them
—what does Grinder Bros, care if I'm ill? Never
mind, mother, I’ll rise above ’em all yet. Give
me the clock, mother.”
She gave him the clock, and he proceeded to
wind it up, and set the alarm.
“There’s somethin’ wrong with the gong,” he
muttered, “ it’s gone wrong two nights now, but
I’ll chance it. I’ll set the alarm at five, that’ll
give me time to dress and git there early. I wish
I hadn’t to walk so far.”
He paused to read some words engraved round
the dial
Early to bed and early to rise
Makes a man healthy and wealthy and wise.
He had read the verse often before, and was
much taken with the swing and rhyme of it. He
had ofun repeated it to himself, over and over
again, without reference to the sense or philosophy
of it. He had never diearned of doubting any-
thing in print, and this was engraved. But now
a new light seemed to dawn upon him. He
studied the sentence awhile, and then read it
aloud for the second time. He turned it over in
his mind again in silence. Then a bright idea
seemed to strike him.
“ Mother ! ’ lie said suddenly, “ I think it lies.”
She placed the clock on the shelf, tucked him into
his little bed on the sofa, and blew out the light.
111.
Arvie seemed to sleep, hut she lay awake think-
ing of her troubles. Of her husband carried home
dead from his work one morning; of her eldest
son who only came to loaf on her when he was out
of gaol; of the second son, who had feathered his
nest in another city, and had no use for her any
longer ; of the next —poor, delicate little Arvie—
struggling manfully to help, and wearing his
young life out at Grinder Bros, when he should he
at schcol; of the five helpless younger children
asleep in the next “room;” of her hard life—
scrubbing offices from 5.30 a.m. till 8, and then
starting her day’s work—washing ! —of having to
rear her children in the atmosphere of brothels,
because she could not afford to shift and pay a
higher rent; and of the rent.
Ai vie commenced to mutter in his sleep.
“Can't you get to sleep, Arvie?” she asked.
“Is your throat sore? Can I get anything for
you ? ”
“I'd like to sleep,” he muttered, dreamily,
“hut it won't seem mor'n a moment before —•
before ”
“Before what, Arvie?’ she asked, quickly,
fearing Unit he was becoming delirious.
“ Before the alarm goes off !”
He was talking in his sleep.
She rose gently and put the alarm on two hours,
“ lie can rest now,” she whispered to herself.
Presently Arvie sat bolt upright, and said
quickly : “ Mother ! I thought the alarm went
off !” Then, without waiting for an answer, he
lay down as suddenly and slept.
* # #
The rain had cleared away, and a bright,
starry dome was over sea and city, over slum and
cilia alike ; but little of it could he seen from the
hovel in Jones’ Alley, save a glimpse of the
Southern Cross and a few stars round it. It
was what ladies call a “lovely night,” as seen
from the house of Grinder— “Grinderville” —with
its moonlit terraces and gardens sloping gently
to the water, and its windows lit up for an Easter
ball, and its reception-rooms thronged by its own
exclusive set, and one of its charming and accom-
plished daughters melting a select party to tears
with her pathetic recitation.
There was something wrong with the alarm-
clock, or else Mrs. Aspinall had made a mistake,
for the gong sounded startlingly in the dead of
night. She woke with a great start, and lay still,
expecting to hear Arvie get up; but he made no
sign. She turned a white, frightened face towards
the sofa where he lay—the light from the alley’s
solitary lamp on the pavement above shone down
thro’ the window, and she saw that he hadn’t
moved.
Why didn’t the clock wake him ? He was
such a light sleeper ! “ Arvie ! ” she called ;no
answer. “Arvie!” she called again, with a
strange ring of remonstrance mingling with the
terror in her voice. Arvie never answered.
“ Oh ! my God ! ” she moaned.
She rose and stood by the sofa. Arvie lay on
his hack with his arms folded—a favourite sleeping
position of his ; but his eyes were wide open and
staring upwards as though they would stare
through ceiling and Yoof to the place where God
,ought to he.
He was dead.
“My God ! My God :! ” she cried.

The “ hymn ” was simply “ God Save the Queen! ’

We beceivocl a ietlbr fl'om an Englishman
Hibbthet daV. The first line contained an allusion

lines he spoke of “my solicitor,” “my banker,”
“my hotel,” “my house ” and “my wife.” Then
he finished up with another allusion to “my
agent” and “my hotel,” and in the postscript ha
mentioned “my wife ” over again. If an English-
man occupies a six-storey room for two nights in a
caravanserai where 80b other people hang oilt, he
alludes to that place as “my hotel ” for the Pest of
his life, and if somebody dra\Vs o'rt him at sight
through a little branch bank, ahd lie doesn’t pay,
be calls tlie place “ my banker ” for ever after-
wards. Yet he doesn’t own the bank, or the

he missed a <£so note out of his vest pocket,
whereupon he grabbed her, and handed her over
to the police. The female searcher, at the watch-
house, found naught, wherefore the woman was
sent away. A fortnight afterwards, in tears, she
met the arresting constable, and told him she had
stolen the note, but wished to make restitution.
He concurred witli her proposal, that, while he
looked the other way, she should slip it under the
cuff of his great coat. He would honorably
promise not to take it out till he got to the watch-
house. This would get him the glory of having
recovered the note, and he would attain his
ambition, which was his “ promotion to the plain
clothes.” The transaction was duly accomplished,
but on reaching the watchhouse, he could not find
any note. The woman had slipped it under his
cuff on the first occasion, which accounted for the
non-success of the female searcher, and had now
taken it out.

“ An Australian Girl ” has been giving the

the woman who pretends to think they are much

was on, he could move about pretty well, he
couldn’t touch bis knee to save his life. Hobbling
down to the office one night, he dropped his stick,
and waited for the next passer-by to lift it for him.
A well-dressed woman happened along first.

as a policeman came round the corner.
“ Trouble you for that stick, constable. Thanks !

don’t in any case remonstrate with your umbrella-

The same correspondent:—
Is not the Australian press mistaken in insinuating
that Bertrand’s detention in gaol, after so many years’
imprisonment, is due to the fact that certain entries in
his diary affect the good name of “ a certain lady con-
nected with a powerful official ?” I am aware that this
belief is current, but 1 can safely deny it. I had means of
knowing a great deal about the case at the time it was
tried, and had access to all the documents which were
taken possession of by the police, and I do not recollect
any such entry in a diary. 1 have no doubt that the story
emanates from Bertrand himself, who is a remarkably
cunning, clever fellow, but intensely vain, and prone to
boast of imaginary conquests amongst ladies in good
society. I knew a good deal of the man when he prac-
tised as a dentist, and I think I should have known of any
■such bonne fortune. Depend upon it that the story you
quote is untrue, and Bertrand is kept in gaol because he
committed a very wanton murder, his victim being his
supposed friend. If no good can result from keeping him
in confinement, what but harm could accrue from his
liberation ? He would undoubtedly have been hanged but
for the astuteness of lus counsel, who took an Untenable
point of law. After keeping the man so long with his
neck in jeopardy, it was decided to take a merciful view
of his case, and the death penalty was commuted.

and no more law-costs incurred. Finally, the
Court ordered a special meeting to be held to ask

The last “high-

certain Australian city
came to a bad end. There
were eighteen of them,
nine being ladies in thin
boots, and they went out
to a remote suburb in
nine cabs, carrying the
o rthodox refreshments
with them. To avoid
drawing attention they
dismissed the cabs round
the corner, and walked
the rest of the way. It
began to rain just as they
arrived, and while they
were waiting for admit-
tance it started to come
down in torrents. The
door was opened by a
flunkey who said the
family was “hout.” They
remarked that they would
come in and wait, but
the menial looked with a
suspicious eye at the
packages and hampers,
and said they had better
call again. All this time
the last eight people at
the. back of the crowd
were getting damp. Then
they explained that they
were a surprise - party,
but the stolid man of
calves merely responded
in a wooden fashion that
he was sorry but the
family was ‘‘ hout. ”
Finally he shut the door
in their faces, and when
they still remained on
the verandah he threat-
ened to call for the
police. Then they went.
They travelled two miles
through bogs and slush
ere they found a cab-
stand, and by that time
the ladies were soaked

Preacher Grubb the other day stormed the
quiet little town of Picton (M.L.), and an awful
frenzy resulted. The congregations were, as
usual, mostly women, and Grubb shrieked at
them, and told them about Sheol, and the last
day, and the horrible note of Gabriel’s horn, and
the rising of the dead, and the rushing of billions
of ghosts through the sunless sky, and the tramp
of milliards of skeletons, and bulgy things with-
out flesh or feet, and slimy devils, and goblins,
and cuttle-fish all walking upon air, and the open-
ing of perdition, and the yells of the lost souls all
rushing for the Gate, till his audience went into
hysterics and the church was full of shrieks.
When the service was over, the terrified congrega-
tion wouldn’t quit, but being turned out at last
they knelt in the muddy street to the utter ruin of
their frocks and stockings, and prayed, and wept
bitterly, and groaned with an exceeding great
groan till near midnight. Then their male rela-
tives began to come for them, and every now and
then a man would find his wife or his sister or his
daughter among the slush, and would carry her
home praying violently as she went. But the
widows, or those whose relatives preferred
to let them slide, stayed on and supplicated, and
gave all their money to Grubb, and confessed their
sins till 12 o’clock, when they mostly made for
home, though the last penitent wasn’t shifted till
12.30. And, as the result of all this fervour, there
is hardly a frock left in the town that isn’t ruined
with mud, and nearly every woman has told all
her principal sins to all the other women in the
place, and done considerable damage to her
character thereby. Women always get ‘ ‘ left ” thus
in a revival. The fashionable bank embezzler
never gives way to pious emotion for fear of dis-
arranging his tie ; but when a hundred women are
gathered together, with Grubb in the chair, they
presently let down their back hair, and tear
off their bonnets, and give themselves away
till their dresses all rip down the back. There is
no cure for this either —except the sudden death
of Pastor Grubb.

spectators turned out to gaze on a mere hour-long
procession of butcher’s carts. What was the
fascination ? The spectacle of a host of jolly-
looking fellows, able to impose tolerably fair terms
on their employers, while depression reigns all
round. Meanwhile, there is the rush after miser-
able clerks’ billets. Respectability !

The Caledonian Financial Association has
its grip on Melbourne Hibernian Hall, for £20,000
—and they talk of foreclosing ! When Shamus
Torlough Shanaghan O’Brallaghan went over
from Carrickfergus and peopled all Scotland with
his own hands (so he did), he never thought of how
his descendant, Tonalt of the Mist, would get his
divvle’s paws on that hall, and threaten to turn
the Eirish out.

Percy Da we, a fervent Wesleyan and
member of the Kensington brass band, shot him-
self through the head last week. The misguided
young man had a theory that all music was the
actual voice of God, and he was wdnt to blow his
clarionet with an air of rapt attention, as though
he wanted to find out what heaven was saying to
the unfortunate audience.

A notable coincidence is that the young
man to whom Miss Rounsevell was to have been
married when in Queensland, is himself an impor-
tant witness in a murder-trial at next Brisbane
Supreme Court sittings.

Anent the clerical drawl : There is a
“divine (what is the origin of this misused term ?)
ministering not a hundred miles from Parramatta
whose final “ ah ” or “ er ” is sublimely ridiculous.
Imagine, if you can, the distortion he inflicts on
the following sentences phonetically understood :
“ Gift up your hearts and live—er ; ” “One foot
in the grave, and the other all but—er.” —W.G.C.
TO REST.
Across the borderland of day,
Through fields of sunflecked foam,
By frowning hills of sombre grey,
The red sun wanders home.
And mellow grows the changeful West
In misty curtains furled ;
And mystic voices sing “To rest,
To rest, O weary world.”
“ To rest, to rest,” they softly sing,
“ To rest, O weary sea;
To rest, to rest, O tired wing—
But what, O Night, of me ? ”
Brisbane, June, 1892.

IMPORTANT CABLEGRAM.
“Sir William Clarke, Bart., was present
at the re-election of H.R.II. the Prince of Wales
as Grand Master of the English Freemasons.”
How pleased the Prince of Wales must be
(And proud his Royal Highness, too !)
When some great Austral absentee
Looms suddenly into his view !
The newspapers, too, grow impressed
And heedless of the inky glare ;
In massive type the fact attest—
“ Sir William Clarke, the millio aii c !”
Oh ! potent spell which hedges round
The moneyed man with world-wide fame,
There seems a sort of bullion sound
Even in the jingle of his name !
It matters not if great or good,
It matters not from whence or where
His presence awes the multitude—
“ Sir William Clarke, the millionaire 1 ”
Let humble merit die unknown,
Let beauly sink in vice and shame ;
Can aught for poverty atone,
Youth, innocence, a spotless name.
The cold, hard world stands sternly by
Or grimly mocks the mute despair,
While hark ! a million voices cry
“ Sir William Clarke, the millionaire 1”
Victorian Masons learn with glee
Their figurehead lias met the Prince,
And know to such a “ chief ” as he
His Royal Highness will evince
The very cream of fellowship—
Enough to make the whole world stare—
For is he not—hurrah ! hip ! hip ! —
“ Sir William Clarke, the millionaire !”
Then flash like some bejewelled thing
The sparkling message through the soa—
More swift than bird upon the wing,
More bright than gem of Arahy ! —
But well may Science fume and fret,
Her proudest feat, forsooth, must hear
Tbe news—that H.R.H. has met,
“ Sir William Clarke, the millionaire !”

the Cure of
All throat and lung diseases, Ayer’s Cherrv
I’ectoral is the best known remedy. When the
bronchial tubes are sore and obstructed with
phlegm, this medicine is invaluable. It is an
anodyne expectorant, and, in cases of dee->
seated consumption, it cures the coughing,
soothes and heals the lacerated tissues, and
Induces refreshing sleep. A few doses are usu*
ally sufficient to a fiord speedy relief in cases of
Colds and Coughs
It is also as speedily efficacious, and prompt
to allay the distressing symptoms of asthma,
bronchitis, sore throat, hoarseness, croup, and
whooping cough, and, in thousands of fami-
lies. is the only cure used. It is the best emer-
gency medicine and should always be at hand.
No household in whicli there are young chil-
dren, can afford to be without

It is related that when the doughty Con-
federate, Captain Semmes, practised law in
Mobile after the war he was one day arguing a
ease in court before his son, who was .) iidge. The
Judge ruled him out, and the old man made some
nasty remarks as to las son’s legal knowledge.
After a sharp tilt of words between father and
son, the Judge said: “At home, sir, 1 respect
you—but I want you to understand that this
court has no more respect for you than the
humblest citizen in the country. Take your seat,
sir !” This story wouldn’t fit in Australia, where
the old man is always the Judge and doesn’t
respect his son a bit.
A certain Australian agnostic lecturer and
Ids wife, some time ago, deserted the freethought
platform for the orthodox rostrum. Before their
‘ conversion,” it is related, the orator and his wife
were staying at a provincial town. Likewise
touring there was a dramatic Cos. One Sunday-, as
w ,8 usual, the gentle agnostic and Madame went
o it to rake in the cash of the unbeliever, leaving
their infant to sleep the sleep of the innocent- or
howl, as it might happen ; as things turned out it
howled and disturbed the rest of two mummers in
the adjoining room. They were both devout
Catholics, and considering the infant to be on the
point of death, were troubled about its soul, so they
got up and baptised it according to the method
prescribed in such cases by the Holy Roman ritual
—in cases where laymen have reasonable grounds
for suspecting that an infant is in danger of dying
before a duly-ordained priest can be summoned.
In the hard old times of unbelief Madame’s most
successful hash-raiser used to be : “Why I left the
Roman Catholic Church ! ” How the infant
secretly returned to that church is possibly a secret
to its parents unto this very day.
Funny
IRISH
BLUNDERS
THE native of the Green Isle who said, “It’s
a great comfort to be alone when your
sweetheart is with you,” and the Irish auctioned
who, while praising some goods he was offering
for sale, exclaimed, “These are just the things I
should like to buy for my wife if she were a
widow,” made very witty bulls. Equally good,
but even more complicated, was that perpetrated
by the exile in America, who pathetically ex-
pressed himself thus: “Sure an’ if I live till I
die, an’God knows whether I will or not, I’ll visit
ould Oireland afore I lave Philadelfy.” A funnier
blunder still was that made by a new-chum
Hibernian, who was a passenger by the Southern
express the other night. He alighted, with other
thirsty souls, at Mittagong, but lingered at tha
bar over hisfavourite nectar longer than he should,
and only regained the platform in time to see tha
tail-lights of the train by which he intended to
have journeyed, receding from his view. For a
moment he was dumb with astonishment, and
then collecting all the energy and presence of
mind he was capable of exerting, he cried,
“ Hould on there, ye blatherin’ engine; falx'
there’s a man on board of ye that’s left behind !”
1 hese stories have all the true Irish ring about
• them, and call up memories of the Irishman who
complained to his physician that he “gave him so
many drugs he was sick a long time after lie got
well.” No one who has used St. Jacobs Oil can
make a similar complaint to that; it never causes
a man to “feel sick after he is well.” St. Jacobs
Oil is an external remedy for the absolute cure of
pain, and it leaves no ill effects behind. After
using it the rheumatic patient leaves his bed, or
throws away his crutches and begins life again a
new man. Hear what Mr. F. W. Kirby, of Mort-
street, Balmain, says about it: “I use St. Jacobs
Oil for rheumatism, and do not know what i
should do without it. The kind of work I am
engaged in compels me to be out in all weathers,
and I often have to remain in wet clothes for
hours together. The result it that I get rheu-
matism badly in my back at times, I find there
is nothing equal to St. Jacobs Oil for shifting it,
and putting me all right again. Both mv wife
and I look upon it as a real blessing. The volun-
tary testimony of thousands of such witnesses
proves that this marvellous remedy possesses the
confidence of all c’asses of the community.
THEY GO UNDER WATER.
A SUPREME TEST.
A brave man is always a truthful man. His
•whole nature is opposed to anything that savors of
sham or deceit, and he will gladly welcome death
in the discharge of a duty rather than face dis-
honor. It is a truism that
Cowards die many times. . .
The valiant never taste of death but once.
Pessimists may croak that there is always the
man for the occasion, provided his services are
well paid for. Well, that’s true enough in a way,
but the easy remunerative billet is always the one
that draws out the greatest number of applicants.
It is wonderful how many men, having an eye to
the main chance, and recognising the value of
<£3oo a year, fancy themselves fit persons to
represent a constituency in the Legislature. But
then the hazard there is small, and lias a reference
only to the time when power is in the hands of
the electors. Amongst men of pluck and daring
are those who “go down to the sea in ships,’ 7
and the still more adventurous persons whose
calling takes them down beneath the turbulent
green waves of the ocean, or the swift running
current of the treacherous river, that they
may recover treasures not their own, or place
foundations destined to produce wealth for
others. Men like these who possess merit them-
selves are not slow to recognise it in others, hence
the following letter addressed to the local agent of
the Waterbury Watch Company, by Mr. T. .1.
Fawkner, submarine diver, Harbors and Rivers
Department, Maclean, Clarence River, under date
18th January, 1892 : “Waterbury Watch received
safely. I have worn it for over three years, and
only had to send it for repairs through an accident
(falling out of my hand). I must say that I never
had such an excellent timekeeper, t often take it
under water with me, and it goes as well under-
water as on top, and is as good now as the day I
got it.” These watches are now obtainable in a
variety of patterns and finish, but all equally good
and reliable.

rpHERE is no artificial beauty lialf so perfect or so
1 admired as NATURAL BEAUTY. What is natural
beautv ’ A clear, firm, healthy skin, such as is seen in
childhood. Why is a child's skin fresh and lovely ;
Because it has not been covered with cosmetics ; it is
natural and healthy ; the pores of the skin are free for
the entrance of pure, fresh air, free for the outtluow of
the impuiities of the blood, which is absolutely necessary.
Nature cleanses her own channels by the force of blood
and good circulation. Cover the entire body with paint
and see how rapidly it ceases to exist. We paint lifeless
obiects to protect them, but we dare not c.og natuie in
her <>reat work. Acne, eczema, comedones, roughness,
oiliness, eruptions, coarseness, discolourations, are only
natural results of closed channels.

ber nth. From birth they have
been fed entirely on your Malted
Food, and from being poor, frail
little mortals, whose lives were
despaired of, they have thriven
and become quite chubby and
jolly little specimens of baby-
hoed. Moreover, so far, they
have been entirely free from
illness of any sort. I ought to
say your food was recommended
us by ourfaniily doctor. Kindly
post us the photographs back at
your convenience.
Yours very faithfully,

WHEN the digestive organs-are out of order
a good reliable tonic is required to bring
them back to their normal state.
A number oi persons upset the stomach by
neglecting to take their meals at regular stated
intervals, and others again cat to excess at some
particular meal —and from these causes the
machinery gets out of order and does not run
smoothly. Late suppers, also, are one of the
causes ofupsetting the digestive organs.
Sister Mary Joseph Aubert, in her researches
amongst the plants of New Zealand, has dis-
covered there is a very valuable remedy for these
complaints in our own vegetation, and after ex-
perimenting for a number of years, J' as now
brought forward the medicine called KAKAJN A.
Dr. Larochette, a chemist of the First Class
cf the Faculty of Paris, to whom samples were
sent, says “Itis an excellent bitter tonic, and
I consider it even superior to the preparation of
Cinchona in all affections of the stomach. It has
given us, prepared as, you sent it, the most satis-
factory results.” .. V •
The Reverend Sister says she has used it tor
many years extensively and successfully with
sufferers of every age and constitution, and she
noticed that in a few cases it did not agree at first',
but by diminishing the dose good results followed.
She remarked astonishing good results on old
people, who had ruined their constitutions by the
abuse of intoxicating drink, and who were debili-
tated and suffering after having turned over a
new leaf.
ENQUIRE WITHIN!
DO you suffer from Headache and Dizziness in
the head ; have you pains under the ribs or
shoulders ; are you affected with heartburn or in-
digestion ? If so, have you ever asked yourself
why this is? You certainly are allowing two of
the chief organs in your structure to become
neglected. The liver and kidneys are responsible
for these ill feelings, and you are getting too much
wc ,ik out of them without attending to their
wants in the particular functions they have to
sustain. . ,
These organs are in continual play day and
night, waking or sleeping, and any constitution
will not stand, be it ever so good, if its internal
requirements are not attended to.
The liver and kidneys cannot put up with re-
pudiation, and they soon let you know it, and it
is highly necessary that “Paramo” should be
administered to their wants. This vegetable pre-
paration is particularly adapted to these com-
plaints, and those persons who have already taken
it assure us they never felt better in their lives.
Mother Mary Joseph Aubert has been particu-
larly successful with “ Paramo,” and is daily
receiving numberless enquiries in reference to it.
The agents are continually getting letters and
telegrams from all parts of New Zealand, and
have confidence in saying that no other remedies
are giving the same amount of general satisfaction.
Give “Paramo ” a fair trial, and note how
quickly your mental depression leaves you. It is
worth the experiment, and will certainly do no
Taradale, Saptember 10,1891.
Dear .Sister,—! have very great pleasure in
testifying to the value of your remedies, as they
were used in my family with wonderful effect for
many vears, and I am especially grateful to you
for saving the life, of my daughter when others
said she would not live.
Trusting you may live long to help and cure the
Suffering.
I am,
Yours faithfully,
W. LORD.
Nkw Zealand Tablet, 16th October, 1891.
The religious orders continue to maintain their
reputations as benefactors of. Society in temporal
as well as in spiritual matters. A new proof of
this is furnished in the remedies which have been
discovered by the Sister Mary Joseph Aubert.
The good Sister, whose-life has been devoted to
the instruction of the Maoris, while she has
laboured successfully at improving their minds
and enlightening their spirits, has not been
neglectful of their bodies. The result is the dis-
covery of a series of medicines manufactured from
native trees and plants, and which have been
proved undeniably to be of almost marvellous
efficacy. It is to the credit of the Catholic Church
in the Colony that one of its missionary Sisters
has distinguished herself in this way, probably
conferring on the world a benefit, little, if any-
thing, inferior to that conferred, for example, by
the Jesuit Fathers who discovered the curative
properties of the Peruvian bark. Not only suffer-
iiw humanity but science itself owes a debt to
this lady, who has made it acquainted with pro
parties of natural products, hitherto unsuspected,
and has enriched the pharmacopoeia. We have,
further, in the matter, an instance of how
relig ous devotion is calculated to quicken the
faculties and to develop the best qualities of
human nature. Sister Mary Joseph is to be
warmly commended for her discoveries, and in-
deed, the community generally may be congratu-
lated on them.

You take a whole column to state that a pig got into the
preacher’s yard and had hot water thrown over him

dies, and being overwhelmed with grief he resolves to
visit the Blue Mountains, and then he catches cold through

of no‘earthly importance....“ J. A.” : You say there is
no such thing as solitude. Did you ever look for it inside

fellow in England?....“ H.8.A.” : Deeming is a dead-

over his tombstone. We don’t admire him much, any-

HOW BABIES SUFFER
From Torturing Humors
When their tender Skins are literally On Fire with Itching and
Burning Eczemas and other Itching, Scaly, and Blotchy Skin and
Scalp Diseases, none but mothers realize.
To know that a single application of the Cutlcura Reme-
dies will, in the great majority of cases, afford instant and complete
relief, permit rest and sleep, and point
to a permanent and economical (because
so speedy) cure, and not to use them
without a moment’s delay, is to be guilty
of positive inhumanity. [No greater leg-
acy can be bestowed upon a child than
a skin without blemish and a body nour-
ished with pure blood.
CUTICURA

cures, blood purifiers, and humor reme-
dies, are absolutely pure, and may be used from pimples to scrofula,
from infancy to age, with the most gratifying and unfailing success.

skin purifier and beautifier, externally, instantly allay the most intense itching, burn-

I and My Breams.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Through long, dim years we have been friends together,
I and my dreams ;
Our friendship has been tried by wintry weather,
I and my dreams.
That oft we’ve quarrelled freely I will own,
And travelled each a different way alone,
I and my dreams.
We could not always make each other out,
I and my dreams ;
My dreams were bright—my life a stormy bout.
I and my dreams
Unclasped our hands, I fell to wond’ring whether
We would he friends, or friendship's ties should sever,
I and my dreams.
We watched the sun set in his western bed,
1 and my dreams ;
We marked the golden path his bright rays shed,
I and my dreams.
And as we marked the glory rise and swell, each sought
To read aright, the others’ pensive thought,
I and my dreams.
And then we smiled a sadly wistful smile,
I and my dreams,
And thought we’d keep together for life’s little while,
I and my dreams ;
It may be in that western world of light
We’ll walk, with hands still clasped, from this world’s
night,
I and my dreams.

A run of ill-luck still follows the magnetists
and faith-healers and the herbal crowd all over
Australia. The last to get into trouble is “pro-
fessor” Burgess of Warrnambool (Vic.), whose
last cancer patient—a girl named Catherine
Brittain —died of blood-poisoning and exhaustion.
The medical witnesses, who always come down like
tons of bricks on the “ professor ” when they can
get at him, declared that the treatment had
accelerated the patient’s death, which was practi-
cally a charge of manslaughter. The jury followed
suit. The coroner denounced the “magnetist”
individual as an “ignorant quack and impostor,’’
and Mr. Burgess is now awaiting trial. And the
moral of all this is that when the bogus “pro-
fessor ” loses a patient he ought to gather up his
properties and run for his life.
Dear Bulletin, —You ask for information
re George Spencer Briggs, Australian litterateur,
now being starred in England. I will tell you
the little I know of a Spencer Briggs—respect-
ing George, I am not sure. Some 15 or 16
years ago there arrived in Armidale a chemist
named Briggs, with his family. They were new
arrivals from Bath, England, and the eldest son,
a very intelligent lad of 14 -or 15, used to assist his
father in a series of lectures on chemistry, which
he gave in Armidale shortly after starting busi-
ness there. The lad’s name was Spencer Briggs.
After a vain endeavour to establish himself in
Armidale, Briggs, sen., moved on to Glen Innes;
anyhow, I never heard of them after they left
Armidale. If my man is identical with G.S.B.,
the Australian litterateur, he is not an Austra-
lian by birth, although, unlike our friend, L. F.
Heydon, he may be one from inclination.—Yours,
Frank Lamb. Chiswick, May 27, 1802.
Mr. Shegog, Governor of Melbourne Gaol,
supplied Deeming with his last earthly smoke. The
wretch ran out of cigars (he couldn’t take to a pipe)
on the Sunday night, so the Governor satisfied the
cravings of his charge until his heart was right up
in his mouth and he wanted to smoke no more. The
cell where he had been accommodated until nine
o’clock smelt strongly of cigars when The Bul-
letin’s representative looked in at about
10.30a.m., and whilst the body of the smoker was
hanging from a beam a dozen yards away.
Deeming managed to get through a couple of the
Shegogian weeds after being awakened at seven
o’clock-—the stories of his collapse notwithstand-
in -. As a matter of fact there was no real
co lapse until he had to shift into the condemned
cell, and then he didn't collapse much, all things
considered. For three weeks he remained in his
dungeon smoking like a chimney and refusing to
take exercise. And still he had some nerve left
at the finish. Stick a newspaper reporter (ironed)
on an old horsehair-bottomed chair in a cigar-
scented dungeon for a like period, then pull him
out and ask him to take part in a billiard-match
before a room-full of people. He would look a
lot worse than Denning on the drop, if you
could see hi.o ‘ on the spot ” with the score at

“Pat.” Buckley (now “Sir”), of Maori-

“ If you wish to be merry, be wise ; and if you
can’t be merry and wise, be wise.”
Wolfe’s Schnapps is the greatest tonic and
most beneficial stimulant of the day.
Beaney’s Cromwell House has a tenant at

Surgeon O’Hara, of tenor celebrity.
In the race for the great prize of popularity
Wolfe’s Schnapps takes the lead.
“ Postscript ” of a lady prisoner’s cross-
examination of a witness at Sydney Quarter
Sessions “ Tommy Briggs, it’s a vronder that

“ Demos ” writes ; “I am cut to the bone
by the sights of poverty in Melbourne. In South
Melbourne this week I saw a stalwart, sober, in-
dustrious young labourer with his wife and four
children, all preparing to camp out, in this winter
time, when a subscription (by the poor) relieved
them. As a great favour, a poor and honest
woman was allowed to sleep in a cell at the South
Melbourne watchhouse —a place infinitely more
cosy than many dwellings I visit in the neighbour-
hood. From things like this, I glance over to
Government House, beyond on the hill, with the
ball-room windows lighted up, like so many eyes,
in insulting mockery, while the members of Par-
liament are junketing.”

A Bend in a Tree.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Standing at the head of a wild mountain gulch,
in a western district, where a slip had cleared the
view, I surveyed the scenery thrown down by
Nature’s hand. Afar, the silvery Pacific lay in
seemingly placid slumber. The mighty spurs
reached down toward the sea like vast claws about
to clutch a basin. Hill and valley were clothed
with forest vegetation. The river rolled rapidly
and irregularly down to the ocean. Below me the
trees clung to the crevices of the rock, and it
seemed imnossible for their naked roots to draw
nutriment from those rents. The day was cap-
tivatingly beautiful —one of the days in a life
when a man would wish to live forever.
At my feet, two men were working in a sluicing
claim. The ground was shallow. Their tail-race
was curved in-and-out to suit circumstances.
Huge trees towered to the skies, and it was part
of the miner’s profession to undermine these
with the nozzle in such a manner that
their fall did not obstruct his future proceedings.
The water was now playing under a withered
forest giant about 80 feet high, with a decided bend
in its trunk some CO feet from the ground. A
small rainbow was visible in the spray under the
jet. I watched with a vague fascination the pro-
gress of their labours.
Presently some dirt fell. Suddenly the tree
swayed and thundered down, seeming to slide at
the roots before it lost its perpendicular. With a
wild yell the men fled in different directions. One
scudded down the tail-race. He reached a bend
in the race and turned at full speed. At that
moment the tree struck the ground. Strange to
say, the bend in its stem exactly fitted the curve in
the race, the weight of the fall and the loss of resist-
ance snapped the piece off, and the broken end
falling into the trench, which was 20 feet deep,
struck the unfortunate miner. From my point of
observation, it seemed as if the tree had been
deliberately cut by an invisible hand.
I hastened to the spot, mentally certain that
Providence had seized a moment when trouble
would follow the accident. I was right. The
bread-winner of a family of eight was gone by this
peculiar arrangement of things. The old tree had
been waiting for a century to get him, and it sue-
ceeded at last.

REV. MOTHER MARY JOSEPH AUBERT.
The Rev. Sister has been for over 30 year B
experimenting, and during that time has succesb-
fully treated hundreds of cases without fee or
reward; and, seeing the great benefit that may
accrue to mankind generally, has consented to
have the medicines put up in saleable form, and
offered to the public under the names of Paramo,
Natanata, Marupa, and Karana, and which
have bepn registered for protection and to avoid
plausible imitations.
A peculiar experience was met with by the Rev.
Mother Mary Joseph Aubort during a recent visit
to Wellington, Being in the garb of her Order
she was recognised, and people who had been
benefited by her wonderful vegetable medicines
and others who intended to undergo a course of
them were so eager to interview the old lady that
she was simply bewildered. Even in her passage
along the streets persons thronged upon her, and
eventually she had to settle down to spending her
time in a cab whenever she wanted to go out of
doors in the Empire City.
Concentrated sunshine is acknowledged to be
Nature’s great remedy for all the ills that human
flesh is heir to. In no part of the world is the
remedy, in rays pure and serene, more freely
lavished than in New Zealand. The sun-
shine playing on a clear, salubrious atmos-
| phere lias left it-> impression on tbf
I fauna and flora of tlie colony. The extinct
moa, the wondrous coal deposits, proclaim the
natural wealth of New Zealand. Tim muscular
Maori and the splendid forests survive. From
these forests Mother Mary Aubert has compounds d
several important rememes, and we recommend
the announcements elsewhere to the perusal nut
simply of the sick but of those in health. “A
stitch in time saves nine ” applies to the healing art
more than to less important matters. Mother
Mary Aubert’s New Zealand Ketnedirs are pi’e-
ventive as well as curative. When the first
symptoms of sickness appear, tl.eir power, in
cutting short the attack by rousing dormant
organs and functions to activity, is said to be
remarkable. Insidious ailments resemble tbe
burglar, but these remedies promptly applied give
the alarm and make him de amp. There is no
quackery about them, they arc not foreign com-
pounds of which people know nothing and which
may be pernicious, but they are the pure products
of New Zealand sunshine distilled through the
vegetable kingdom. Better than all, their char-
acter has been proved for they have been well
tested, and the best proof of their merits is that
their sale is rapidly increasing.

How did old John Fairfax feel in Heaven when
fhe S.M. Herald came out with a column leader on such
a beastly affair as the Jackson-Slaviu fight? And then
jook at how enterprising the Herald was over Deeming!
* * #
In what was, all things considered, an able
leader on the Slavin-Jackson fight, the S.M. Herald said
the downfall of the P.R. was brought about by an Act for-
bidding railway companies carrying parties to prize-
fights. This is wrong. For instance, how could a ticket-
clerk or station-master discern whether a crowd were on
scrapping intent ? What the Act did was to deter com-
panies from allowing passengers to alight except at recog-
nised railway stations. It was always customary to stop
the train at a secluded part of the line and then pitch
ropes, stakes, &c. Next to the blackguardism of the pugs
themselves, nothing settled the ring so much as the law
which made a spectator to a prize-fight particeps criminis.
Jackson’s rceent victory sustains the old P.R.
theory that a good, straight left can always overcome a
smashing right. The reason is obvious: In ordinary
position the left is ever so much quicker in its action,
having a.shorter distance to travel and going straight
instead of half-round, as the right must. In old days the
rule was never to use the right except at close-quarters.
Johnel s success over half-trained second-raters with his
marvellous right has ruined modern boxing. Jackson’s
style is the beau ideal of twenty years ago.

theatre Royal was a constable, who seemed much puzzled ,
when lompey” suddenly swerved round, and pullitv
out a black silk handkerchief, asked him very abruptly’
Whats der color er dis?” “Black,” the constable J
civilly replied. ‘Yes,” said “Pompe3',” drawing himself
u.P another half-an-inch and slapping his chest with the I
air of a Spanish grandee; “Black-right! Dat am my
colour . And then he sailed majestically on.

St. Hugo, Derby winner, is the biggest outsider
since Hermit.
* # *
For the first time in Derby history the House of
Commons rejected the usual motion for an adjournment
over the great race-day. Sir Wilfrid Lawson made his
point at last. He has been taking a division on the ques-
tion for many years, and increasing his little army of
followers at each attempt until now they have given the
old institution its death-blow. The House recognises the
Derby no more. The number of lords and dukes who run
horsesisgreaterthan.it ever was, but the turf stinks in
the nostrils of “ respectability ” and the glory of the Blue
Ribbon has departed.

Lord Bradford, who won the Epsom Derby with
Sir Hugo, is one of the “mysterious” owners. His
horses are trained in comparative seclusion, and their
trials are snares for everybody but the “stable,” repre- j
sented by the trainer and one other at the most. Probably I
Bradford is allowed to.be in the know because he doesn’t !
“go talking,” but the men who pull the strings know’ a I
little more than his Ludship. The ordinary owner, as ;
everybody must understand, is usually the most pro-
foundly ignorant man on earth in matters connected with
his stud, and when he lias a horse proved to be above the
average, he delights in backing it heavily for aji the races
it doesn’t win. No dead certainties come from the Brad?
ford stable with a flourish of trumpets and get igno-
miniously beaten: They are horses that “ may be
included in the dangerous division,” and start at 20~ to 1
in big events. Frequently they are said “to -have been
doing badly at work,” and the worse they do before the
race the better they perform in public. Evidently the
British aristocracy didn’t get a very decided whisper
about Sir Hugo, who started a rank outsider in a small
field and upset Baron Hirsch’s “pot.” Wales and his
crowd would all be on the favourite, of course, and it is
improbable that any member of the Royal Family slapped
Bradford on the back after they had recovered from the
surprise.
Jack Slavm had better luck than his brother,
as he beat Con Riordan in 19 rounds in England on the
2nd inst. On his Australian form, Jack. Slavic was a rank
outsider.
* # *
Mr. Hill has not got another champion in Sham-
rock. He was genuinely backed by his party in the
Winter Stakes, and this remarkably clever party once
again “ fell in the soup,” as Shamrock was unable to show
up prominently.
• # «
Most of the sporting papers which tipped Slavin
to beat Jackson are taking their groats unkindly. It is
hard to see how they argue cut that Slavin was not
trained, seeing that he fought a stone lighter than
Jackson.

dead against them. One of the crew, to the writer’s
knowledge, was more fit to call in a doctor than pull a
race, and the positions gave Victoria an advantage of fully
a length.

They talk in England of prosecuting Jackson
and Slavin over their recent bout. Absurd. It was
known months beforehand that the mill was coming off
on a certain date, and if illegal the police who witnessed
the fight without interfering should be prosecuted as
accessories. However, as a British peer was amongst the
bottleholders, &c., it is not likely the prosecution will
take place.

Tattersall s Grand National Steeplechase, won
by Mr. “Petty” Gannon’s Grandwing, produced one of
the grandest races ever seen at Randwick, yet was not
responsible for a single accident. The win was popular.
Nolan secured the hurdles as well as the “steeple.”
Grand wing is the best steeplechaser on the Sydney side.

How soft Slavin was to admit, a few days after
the fight, that Jackson was the better man ! When he
blamed his had training for his defeat, several clubs set to
work to put up big prizes for a return match, but who
wants to see a light between Slavin and the man he pro-
claims to be his superior? By letting loose his tongue he
gave away thousands.

The colour-line does not count for much in
Sydney, judging from the jubilation over Peter Jackson’s
win.
The way.in winch it was found out that foot-
bailer Webb was being paid to play with Geelong, was
that the suspicions of the residents were raised at the
enormous salary (£2 per week) given him. 1 Never before
had a shop-assistant in Geelong received: such a princely
screw. Had they started Him at £l'and gradually worked
up, no one would have interfered.
A ‘remarkable coincidence at the Birthday
Meeting, at Flemington, was that the-horses which won
the Hurdle, Royal Handicap and Steeplechase (Bolton
Sir John and Roll Roy) had each run second the week
previous at the Hunt Club Meeting, on the same course-
Bolton to Knight of the Garter ; Sir John to All There •’

An advertisement for men to start the big
Melbourne sewerage job at Werribee caused about
1000 “unemployed”—mostly pick and shovelt
experts—to rush for the early morning train from
Spencer-street station the other morning. The
ordinary train under the new retrenchment regime
could barely accommodate the ordinary number o»£
passengers, and only a few of the unhappy
labourers, all of whom had paid Is. lid. each for
a ticket, were allowed to come on to the platform
and fight for standing room. Many hundreds of
them were shut out and told to wait five hours for
the next train, a special not being dreamt of in the
philosophy of the anti-Speight management. The
befooled navvies waited accordingly, and got
down to Werribee in time to find most of the first
detachment cursing their fate. Fifty men only
had been engaged. No extra train was provided
for the return journey, so the other 950 poor
fellows shivered on the Werribee platform for
hours and got home as best they could ! They had
contributed nearly <£loo in all to the railway
revenue, and been treated like dogs. The luckiest
of them picked up a few Werribee mushrooms for
consolation.

Higher Education.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
When John Henty first came up to hospital he
was the personification of Church principles—his
Walk, his necktie, and the very laugh of the man
told you that he was a good churchman and a
firm believer in the creed of St. Athanasius. He
had rooms above mine and running down now and
then veneered us with a layer of his own respect-
ability. Men sitting about my room grew better
as he talked of his home, the old parsonage, pet
rabbits, and his sister. Charley Woods dropped
his “damns” and substituted “darn it,” and
Jefferies, the biggest rake in the college, donned a
Josephian purity of anecdote.
We met frequently without Henty and dis-
cussed the boy’s education, deciding ultimately by
a majority of one to leave him in the gentle hands
of Time and the omnipotent influence of his sur-
roundings.
Eighteen months of the coarser blasphemies of
a scientific education spoilt the charm of his clean
individuality, and I came back from Norway to
find him doubting the Immaculate Conception.
If you spoke of free will he would smile pitifully
and offer you a pamphlet.
The mere fact of another good-looking boy
placing his curly head beneath the wheels of the
juggernaut that Darwin started for the hawking of
doubts about the country would have been a small
matter had he not taken home with him the
cursed miasma of his doubts. But when I saw—for
I spent the long vacation with him —instead of the
old love-light that flew about the table in the
olden days from the sister, a wide-eyed dread for
the boy; from the mother a moister love for him,
and from the good clergyman’s self an anxious
watching for his prayers fulfilment, then, for the
first time, it dawned upon me how truly tragic it
was, from these people’s point of view, to be with-
out God in the world.
The end of Henty’s third year found him a
pagan of the new, or microscopic, order; he had
voluntarily relinquished all faith in the Infinitely
Great that he might have more time and energy to
devote to his new heritage, the Infinitely Little.
He now spelt God with a small “g,” and wore
dittoes on Sunday.
A prize offered by one of the professors for an
essay “ On the probable seat of the higher
moralities ” brought matters to a climax. I did
not see the boy for a fortnight. He sent me one
note by the servant saying, “ I shall not see you
for a few days ; I am going for the moralities
bald-headed 1”
One evening there came from his room the echo
of a mighty harangue, and I rushed up to find
Henty and the kitchen-maid. He had placed her
in his arm-chair, and with widely-dilated pupils
and hair on end was explaining to her his theory
of the fibrous interlacing that characterises the
two divisions of the medulla oblongata. The girl
was paralysed, and the boy was mad. I released
her, and he, taking up his essay, read to me as he
paced the room and gesticulated frantically 15
pages that comprised all that three years of
research had taught him, and which is still
regarded as the standard basis of mental research,
and two pages more of the wildest and most
inconsequent ranting; the line of demarcation
between the sense and nonsense marked the
moment of his brain-snapping.
Henty’s position as one of our most promising
students secured for him the constant attendance
of our staff. Each man came, stood over him,
examined his tongue, took his temperature, and
ordered him drugs, but still the patient raved, and
we all grew anxious.
One morning, contrary to the advice of his
many doctors, I telegraphed for his friends; they
came at nine—a consultation of all the specialists
had been arranged for ten, and I went up with
them. As the five of us entered the sick-room with
the cultured solemnity of our fraternity, a strange
picture presented itself. At the foot of the bed
stood the old clergyman and his wife, stooping
over the same book, the girl, with one hand in her
brother’s and the other holding her half of another
book which Henty shared, was leading the sing-
ing, and the hymn they sang was, “ Art thou
weary, art thou languid.” Tears were falling fast
from the old couple, the girl’s voice was half
tremulous, but quite strong, and the patient’s
quiet, bright face told us that he had gone back to
his boyhood and found his sanity.
The shock of our entry spoilt for a moment the
harmony, and the girl, out of respect for the
specialists, would have stopped the singing had
not the youngest and wisest among the doctors
motioned her to continue, and, taking at random
a handful of books from the table and giving one
to each of his confreres, pushed us into position
about the bedside. A capacity to sing hymns is
not common among University professors, and a
sense of decency only compelled our oculist to
bend reverently over Huxley’s handbook and
move his lips. The great authority on bones
peered into Haeckel, and was soon so lost to his
surroundings that he forgot to hum, while the
comparative biologist froWned and stared restively
from one to another, as though brought suddenly
into contact with a new and interesting species.
The singing over, Henty sank back upon his
pillow asleep, and the rest of us, with one excep-
tion, moved about the room uncomfortably—as
boys caught in the act of something mean.
The exception was the lecturer on bones, who
had found something in his book with which ho
did not agree, and the old war-horse was dead to
all else but the smell of battle from afar and the
hope of a future controversy.
The consultation that followed in my sitting-
room was a scene never to be forgotten. The boy
above, who had defied all treatment, and before
whose sleeplessness bromide and its allies had
failed ignominiously, was sleeping the sleep of
the just, and that, too, under a treatment that
had no written formula, nor was it included in
the columns of the British pharmacopoeia.
Hearing a movement outside, I went out, to
find the sister on the landing, and we waited there
until one of the doctors, with grim solemnity,
summoned us to hear the verdict.
The leading of the girl to her chair, the attitude
of the men as they gathered about her, was the
quintessence of professional formality.
“ We have been discussing your brother’s case,”
started the authority on mental diseases, under
whose special care Henty had been placed, “and
we have come to the conclusion that his pre-
sent condition is a somewhat serious one. For
sometime past I gather he has suffered from a
species of nerve-storm indicative of cerebral
hyperemia.”
“ In his letters to us,” the girl interjected, “he
has only spoken of headache.”
“ Headache, ah 1 well, that is but another name
for the disease to which I refer. Well, these
nerve-storms,-or headaches, as you call them, are
interesting to my colleagues and myself as sympto-
matic of a retrograde metamorphosis of nerve
element.” He took a deep breath, and with a
smile of self-satisfaction, asked if he made his
meaning clear. The girl bowed, and he continued :
“ This condition of things, Miss Henty, calls for
the exhibition of an alterative regime.” He looked
at his colleagues, and they smiled their acquies-
cence, “My friend, Dr. Holt, has examined the
patient’s retina, and although he finds a most
undoubted tendency to stamingspipilla, he is
inclined to think that the lesion is inorganic, and
once the balance between the choroid pressure and
the hoematomic tendency is re-established, the
apparent solution of continuity will disappear.
Our advice, then, Miss Henty, is that the altera-
tive treatment to which I referred, combined with
ozonic atmospheric surroundings, should be ”
“Might not we take him home and feed him
up!” the girl asked.
“Exactly,” exclaimed the youngest of the
fraternity; “take him home, give him eggs and
milk all day, lawn-tennis in the afternoon, and a
hymn"at bed-time,” and then they bowed them-
selves out, and the girl, turning to me, asked, in
tones full of anxiety, “Is Jack so very bad?”
seen upstairs, and it was not until I had explained
to LerSh* .i. value of expert opinion deeded
fi Xt: ,ty ° f
Together we went back to the bed-room, and
putting on the boy s dressing-gown the four of us
sat around the fire—talked birds’-nesting, fishing
days, and the village folk, until the ring of his old
laugh came back as wholesome as Naaman’s skin,
and the mother gladdened in her heart. Three
months later John Henty resigned his position as
a medical student, and the profession as a liveli-
hood. In a private letter to me, he said, lam
helping my father in his parish, and shall enter
the Church. Is it not strange,” he concluded,
“that my search for the seat of the higher mora-
lities should have been so successful ; for surely I
have found them in this quiet village, with its
sinlessness, my cricket club, and the romping of
our children about the seashore, while I yarn to
them of shells?'’ *
When at the end of the session the prizes
were distributed, my friend’s name was mentioned
for the last time. “A prize offered by myself for
an essay on the probable seat of the higher mora-
lities,” he said, speaking with evident emotion,
“ was won by John Henty, but I regret to say
that since then he has belied the promise of his
earlier student days, and matters culminated last
week when he severed his connection with the
University. The most charitable construction
that we can place upon his conduct is the supposi-
tion that the illness of which you may have heard
resulted in the deterioration of those higher brain
centres that are responsible for the growth of the
best intellectualities, and which it is our intention

“ I met Christie Murray, a few days ago,”
writes a Bulletin correspondent from London.
“He is one of the most picturesque - look-
ing men you could see in a week’s walk.
His hair is almost silvery white, and he
allows it to flow in graceful curls down to
his shoulders. He has been very ill with in-
fluenza, and still bears traces of it. He has just
returned from a short tour with “Ned’s Chum”
in Scotland, and reports a successful time. Little
Leo Byrne has made a great hit, and is pro-
nounced to be far away the best boy actor ever
seen in England in our day. Christie is taking
his company to some of the large provincial towns,
and expects to make money with his play. He
recently sold to a clever Midland speculator the
serial rights of his story, “Bob Martin’s
Daughter,” for =£7oo. He finds now to his disgust
that the smart Midlander has already made £l7OO
out of his bargain.”

A Night with a “Hatter."
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
I have often Heard of men’s hair turning white
in a single night through terror, but I don’t
believe it. Anyhow, my hair didn’t change colour
that night, and 1 reckon I went through enough
to whiten the head of a nigger.
I was coming down one of the Seven Creeks in
the Strathbogie ranges one cold, rainy evening,
looking for a place to camp, when just at the foot
of one of those long bills 1 sighted a big gum-tree
all rotten and burnt out, but still standing. It was
just large enough inside for one man, and seemed
to have been well patronised, judging from the
snug bed of dry boughs and leaves inside, and the
large heap of ashes just in front. I threw my
swag inside, for it had settled into a steady rain,
got a good fire going and a heap of wood for the
night, and then went down to the creek for a billy
of water.
When I came back I was not overjoyed to find
another swag beside mine in the tree, and the
proprietor of it bringing a big log for the fire as a
hint that he meditated camping there that night.
I spoke civilly enough to him but I thought to
myself there would be trouble at turn-in time. He
must have perceived it was only large enough
for one, and I could see he had no tent. As soon
as I had finished my tea and damper I unrolled
my swag and lay down full length in the dis-
puted territory, remembering that possession
is nine points of the law. To my surprise,
ho took no notice of this John-Bullish pro-
ceeding—ho just squared off in front of
the fire and began talking to himself, scarcely
loud enough for me to hear. Now, although I was
a now-chum to the bush, I had often heard of mad
swagsmon, and knew they were generally harmless
creatures who had gone cranky through carrying
bluey over hot scorching plains from one year’s
end to another in the now almost hopeless
search for work. But somehow I didn’t like the
gleam in his eyes when I found them fastened on
me once or twice with a wild, hunted look in them.
I now looked him over, carefully noting that he
was a big, strapping six-foot man, which fact,
along with his eye-glare, made me think posses-
sion might not mean so many points, after all.
With these things in view 1 tried to draw him
into a pleasant conversation when I found to my
alarm that he would talk of nothing but murder.
My efforts to start an argument with him over
Henry George’s theory fell flat. Even my forcible
remarks about General Booth failed to interest
him. I have often felt more satisfied and at peace
with everybody than I did when ho came and sat
down just at my feet out of the rain, and began
to rub his great, long sheath-knife with a small
stone, at the same time remarking that, talking
about murders, ho believed many a man had been
killed in these ranges, and no one was ever the
wiser of it. I lost no time in assuring him that I
didn’t believe a man had ever killed another yet
■without being caught and hanged. I even grew
eloquent on the fact that murder will out, and
gave several instances of it which had come under
my own observation. Some of these facts were a
groat strain on my imagination, but I kept at it. I
also dwelt at some length on the almost miraculous
sagacity of our detectives, not forgetting the
wonderful native black-tracker, who never loses
a track once he starts on it. Then I pointed out
how the bushrangers had all been run down,
despite the fact that they were expert bushmen,
after which I tried to drift in an offhand, uncon-
cerned way on to the Home Rule question, as I
thought I had noticed some brogue in his talk.
But he took no interest whatever in the fact that
I would like to see England blown to pieces some
dark night, so that the Irish people could govern
themselves.
“ Look here, mate,” he said, leaning over me,
and feeling the edge of his knife, “you can talk
as you like about crimes being found out, but I’ve
done some things in my time which I wouldn’t
want to have found out, I can tell you. I’ll tell
you a thing I did once; it will ease my mind a
bit, but I warn you if you let it out, I’ll haunt
you to your grave.”
I intimated that I always respected the confi-
dence of a friend.
“Mo and Dick Jones went up this very creek
years ago, away back in them dark ranges, where
white man had never been. I didn’t treat Dick
square either. You see, I’ll tell you how it was.
We followed this creek up for two weeks, pros-
pectin’ here and there, till at last we struck
payable ground. Then Dick he takes the two
packhorses and goes back for rations, leavin’ me
to look after the claim. Well, lie comes back
in about ten days, and, paralyse mo, if lie
didn’t bring his wife and two boys with him.
Queer place to fetch a woman, wasn’t it ? We was
getting on right enough till one Sunday I hap-
pened to go up on the ledge of rock above Dick’s
tent to see if I could see any smoke down the
creek. Of course we didn’t want our place to bo
found out, and I noticed the great flat rock which
hung over Dick’s tent wasvery loose. You see, Dick
had rigged a sort of house-tent close against the
bottom of the ledge so as to get under the shelter
of the overhanging rock. It must have hung out
nearly 20ft. over the ledge. While I stood looking
down a sudden thought struck me—‘Why divide
that gold ?’ There was enough in that claim to
make one man rich. Well, to make a long story
short, that night about twelve I creeps out of my
bark humpy, gets a long sapling for a lever, and
sneaks round on to the ledge. I got the sapling in
between it and the main rock and found I could
shift it easy. Then I goes and looks down.
Everything was very quiet. There was the white
roof of the tent showing among the scrub and the
fire just dying out. Then I gives one great heave
and that big rock fell flat on Dick’s tent. They
never knew what struck ’em. That rock weighed
hundreds of tons. Well, I stood watching the
fire a minute and then I goes down to cover all
signs of the crime and —but I’m keeping you
awake, mate, so I think I’ll just shove on another
billy of water. I always like a drink of hot tea
before turning in. Take no notice if you hear me
going about in the night—l’m a terror to walk in
ray sleep. What? Take your bed. Oh, no, I’ll make
my doss down at the back of this tree. A little
rain won’t hurt an old hand like me, only some-
times it makes me feel queer in the head.”
Then he took his billy and went down towards
the stream. If ever I rolled my swag quicker
than I did that time, the occasion has escaped my
memory. I walked till near morning, and was
wet to the skin when I sighted an old splitter’s
hut. I found four men asleep inside, but they all
roused up when they found I was wet through.
When I told them the way I had come, they asked
me if I had missed the hollow tree. I told them I
had camped there, but—-here they all roared out
laughing, and sung out all together “How did he
shift yon ?” I was a lot puzzled till one of them
explained :
“ How did you and Jim Carney get on ? He is
a hard case, and no mistake. You see, he left
here last night, as he reckoned he would reach the
old hollow-tree before it set in to rain. I told him
to stop here, as he might find someone already
camped there, but he said he was in a hurry to get
into Mansfield, and, anyhow, ho said if he found
anyone camped there he would shift him, if he
weighed a ton. So he shifted you, did he ? How
did he manage it ? ’
I gravely informed them that I had been too
well brought up to deprive an older man of his
bod, on a wet night especially. Then I went on
drying my clothes. Some people are too curious
to live.
BOILING BILLY.
Featherstonhaugh.*
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Brookong station lay half-asleep
Dozed in the waning western glare,
’Twas before the run had been stocked with sheep
And only cattle depastured there,
As the Blueeap mob reined up at the door
And loudly saluted Featherstonhaugh.
“ My saintly preacher,” the leader cried,
“ I stand no nonsense, as you’re aware,
I’ve a word for you if you’ll step outside,
Just drop that pistol and have a care,
I’ll trouble you, too, for the key of the store,
For we’re short of tucker, friend Featherston-
haugh.”
The muscular Christian showed no fear,
Though he handed the key with but small delay;
He never answered the ruffian’s jeer
Except by a look which seemed to say—
“ Beware, my friend, and think twice before
You raise the devil in Featherstonhaugh.”
Two hours after he reined his horse
Up in Urana, and straightway went
To the barracks, the trooper was gone, of course,
Blindly nosing a week-old scent
Away in the scrub around Mount Galore.
“ Confound the fellow!” quoth Featherstonhaugh.
“ Will any man of you come with me
And give this Blueeap a dressing-down?”
They all regarded him silently
As he turned his horse, with a scornful frown.
“You’re curs, the lot of you, to the core—
I’ll go by myself,” said Featherstonhaugh.
The scrub was thick on Urangeline,
As he followed the tracks that twisted through
The box and dogwood and scented pine
(One of their horses had cast a shoe).
Steeped from his youth in forest lore.
He could track like a nigger, could Featherstou-
haugh.
He paused as he saw the thread of smoke
From the outlaw camp, and ho marked the
sound
Of a hobble-check, as it sharply broke
The silence that held the scrub land bound.
There were their horses—two, three, four—
“lt’s a risk, but I’ll chance it!” quoth Feathcroton-
haugh.
He loosed the first, and it walked away,
But his comrade’s silence could not be bought,
For he raised his head with a sudden neigh,
And plainly showed that he’d not be caught.
As a bullet sang from a rifle-bore—
“lt’s time to be moving,” quoth Fcatherston
hangh.
The brittle pine, as they broke away,
Crackled like ice in a winter’s ponds.
The strokes fell fast on the cones that lay
Buried beneath the withered fronds
That softly carpet the sandy floor—
Swept two on the tracks of Featherstonhaugh.
They struck the path that the stock had made,
A dustily-red, well-beaten track,
The leader opened a fusillade
Whose target was Featherston’s stooping back
But his luck was out, not a bullet tore
As much as a shred from Featherstonhaugh.
Rattle ’em, rattle ’em fast on the pad,
Where the sloping shades fell dusk and dim ;
The manager’s heart beat high and glad,
For he knew the creek was a mighty swim.
Already he heard a smothered roar—
“ They’re done like a dinner!” quoth Featherston-
haugh.
It was almost dark as they neared the dam ;
He struck the crossing as true as a hair;
For the space of a second the pony swam,
Then shook himself in the chill night air.
In a pine-tree shade on the further shore,
With his pistol cocked, stood Featherstonhaugh
A splash—an oath—and a rearing horse.
A thread snapped short in the fateful loom,
The tide, unaltered, swept on its course
Though a fellow creature had met his doom,
Pale and trembling, and struck with awe,
Blueeap stood opposite Featherstonhaugh.
While the creek rolled muddily in between
r The eddies played with the drowned man’s hat.
The stars peeped out in the summer sheen,
A night-bird chirruped across the flat —
Quoth Blueeap, “ I owe you a heavy score,
And I’ll live to repay it, Featherstonhaugh.”
But he never did, for he ran his race
Before he had time to fulfil his oath,
I can’t think how, but, in any case,
He was hung, or drowned, or maybe both.
But whichever it was, he came no more
To trouble the peace of Featherstonhaugh.

Long Jim’s Love Story.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ ‘ When Shadders Build ’; that’s my song,” said
Jim, as he gazed dreamily into the lire. It was a
fine night, after two of storm and rain, and the
cattle, tired out by two restless camps, were sleep-
ing soundly on a dry sand-ridge. Long Jim was
the bullock-driver, and was a living example that
the bullock-driver is born, not made. To see him
straighten up a team on a bad pinch was to wit-
ness a work of high art. There was no raving
and swearing accompanied by a storm of whip-
cracks, but by some magic impulse the beasts
wore touched up to the right degree, and then,
all together, with one mighty heave, something
had to come.
“ ‘ When Sparrows Build,’ I suppose you mean,”
said the cook.
“ Ah, it might be when sparrers build, but I
didn’t get the right hang of the words—it was the
way it was sung fetched me.”
“ Where did you hear it sung, Jim ?” I asked.
“ Down in Port Swan just before we started.”
“It was a gal sang it, I suppose?” said the
cook as he piled a shovelful of hot embers on to the
top of the camp-oven.
Jim sighed deeply in affirmation : he was a
taciturn man and never spoke more than he could-
help.
That was the first I heard of Jim’s love story.
We had a long trip, and after delivering the
cattle, I returned by steamer; Jim came down as
well and we both disembarked at Port Swan. On
the second day, Jim came to the hotel where I
was staying and sheepishly asked me if I would go
down to where he was putting up and have a
drink ? I had almost forgotten about the girl who
sang “ When Sparrows Build,” but something in
Jim’s manner brought it to my mind, and I
guessed I was about to see the damsel.
She was behind the bar, and it was with much
pride Jim asked me what I would partake of.
“ Poor Jim,” I thought when I looked at her.
The remains of a once fine woman, one who had
come down step by step until she had to earn a
living as barmaid in a second-rate pub. in a little
seaport. Poor Jim !
Jim saw nothing of this ; to him the little arts
and smiles, that in a young girl would have been
appropriate and charming, were quite real. He
accepted her fascinations at her own valuation,
and was supremely happy. I knew Jim was a
quiet fellow who had saved a bit of money ; but it
was impossible to wafn him in any way—he was
in the toils. Before I left Port Swan Jim got
married, and as I went away out back I did not
hear of him for some time.
Two years afterwards as I was riding towards
B , I overtook two bullock-teams, and thought I
recognised the lanky figure with the leading team.
Sure enough it was Jim. He was delighted to
see me, but when I asked after the wife I received
only an evasive reply, I camped with the teams
that night, and his mate told me what I expected
—that she had made Jim’s money fly and then
insisted on going out as barmaid again, as she
couldn’t bear being left by herself when he was
away on the roads.
“She’s keeping straight enough,” went on my
informant, “at the same time it would be a
deuced good thing for Jim if she did take up with
some other fellow and clear out.”
Evidently the girl who sang “ When Sparrows
Build ” was not popular amongst Jim’s friends.
“ Can you give me some quinine, my mate’s
awful bad with fever.”
It was on the road to the Kimberley. The speaker
had come from a camp just off the road, and
stopped us as wo were passing. It was noon, so
we turned out for a spell and I went over to see
if I could do anything for the sick man. Gaunter
and leaner than ever, there lay poor Jim, shaking
with ague, under a pile of blankets. We stopped
there that night, and next day Jim was better,
but he told mo nothing about himself, or how he
came to be seeking a fortune on Kimberley. We
had to go on, but I promised Jim to keep a look-
out for him up there if we should be at the same
camp. I saw Jim several times during the
ensuing months, but ho never said a word about
the past. .
“ There’s a pub. started at the 18-mile camp,”
said one of the fellows one evening. “The
fellow who is running it has got his “wife”
with him. Had a good voice once, and does a bit
of singing now.”
“Good enough for the place, I suppose,’ said
one of the others.
“Yes, she was grinding out ‘When Sparrows
Build ’ the night I was in there.”
Jim was smoking at our fire that evening, but
he made no remark, and I was not surprised to
hear the next day that he had gone over to the
18-mile. I was a little bit uncomfortable, for if
his wife had run away and this was she, why,
there’s no knowing what a quiet man will do some-
times.
Next day, however, he turned up smiling.
“ It’s ail right,” he said to me confidentially.
“ What is ? ” I asked in surprise.
“Why, about my wife. It was her right enough,
but I frightened the d%vil out of the pair of them,
and I got this,” and he produced a piece of paper.
It ran as follows “ I hereby give up all right and
title in my husband, James Strickland, and we
mutually agree to leave each other alone for the
future. (Signed) Agnes Strickland.”
Naturally I roared with laughter. “ Why,
Jim,” I said, “ what’s the good of this ?”
“ Why, she said I could get married again, and
that she could do the same, and that she had no
claim on me for money or anything after signing
this.” .
“Rubbish, Jim, you are as much married as
ever. You would get a divorce without much
trouble I expect; but this paper is only humbug,
and she knew it.”
“ Well I’m hanged, and I wanted to clear out
back to Queensland and settle down. Now I’ve
stood a lot; she spent all my money, she ran
off with this fellow, and now she’s trying to make
a fool of me, but I’m full.”
Jim went away muttering, and three days after-
wards I heard that there had been a fearful com-
motion at the 18-mile. Jim and his mates
had rolled up and half killed the shanty keeper,
and burnt the place down ; there were no police
up there, and the fellows all enjoyed the sport.
Jim’s patience was exhausted. Shortly after he
returned to Queensland,-and when next I saw him
I was able to tell him that he was really a widower,
as his wife was dead of fever. He is married
again, but his wife does not sing. Jim says he
hates such nonsense.
DELCOMYN.
The Anglican Bishop of Exeter has ad-
ministered the rite of confirmation to a number
of the inmates of an asylum for idiots. Confirmed
idiots !
The daily newspapers allowed their imagin-
ations to run riot on the subject of Deeming in
prison. His alleged autobiographies, so full of
lurid confessions and startling tales of adventure,
were no more than a series of drivelling reitera-
tions of his disconnected “speech ” from the dock,
interspersed with doggerel rhyme and obscenity.
He never regarded the only book supplied to him
(a large, seedy-looking volume with “ Church of
England Chaplain’s Bible” inscribed on the fly-
leaf) as other than a dull substitute for a Zolaian
novel, and ho steadfastly refused to talk about his
future until he couldn’t get anybody to join him
in conversation about anything else. The “ two
warders, one on either side, guarding him night
and day in his cell” were a journalistic fiction.
He didn’t have anybody in his cell except himself.
Three warders were told off, in the usual way, to
take turns at sitting outside'the iron gate of his
apartment within a recess that is a decidedly
tight fit for one at a time.
The last daily paper story about the Dora-
Dora blacks has just gone bung, and the bottom
has fallen out of it. According to this latest
Ananias the pair were travelling in Queensland
when one of them was chewed by a snalce and dis-
abled. Then the pair either climbed down or fell
down an abandoned shaft, or a hole, or someplace,
and either hid tliere or weren’t able to get out.
Anyhow, a white man found them —one dying and
the other in good health and ready for new
atrocities —and was just going to capture the
pair, or to run away, or something, when
a gun was placed against his head and lie
had to put his hands up. Then a contribution ot
victuals was levied upon him—either he was
carrying the victuals or else the healthy
black made him go and get them ; and
after that the principal aborigine left him and the
sick nigger together, and struck out for parts un-
known with the provender. This story held good
for several days, and then a short, dry paragraph
appeared stating that it was all lies—the snake
included, and the legendary pair had neither been
seen nor heard of. No explanation was offered as
to the origin of the tale. At latest advices there
reason to believe that one of the Dora Dora
blacks is about to start-a paper in Sydney, and the
other one is to be made a K.O.M.C.
