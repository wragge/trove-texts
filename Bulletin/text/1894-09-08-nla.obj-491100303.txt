BOOKS OF THE D-A-T.
On receipt at The Bulletin Office, Sydney, of Postal Order, Postal Notes, or Stamps equal
to the price stated, any book in the subjoined list will be forwarded to any Australian address ;
“THE YELLOW ASTER,”
By lota. 6s. 6d.
HUTCHINSON & CO. Bm, Cloth, 307 pp.
When a book goes through a dozen editions in little more than as many weeks, the proof is pretty conclusive that it cannot be dull, at all events. And dulness
is the last reproach that can be flung at “A Yellow Aster.” It is “queer,” to be sure. Not many girls in Australia grow up incapable of flirtation, and prepared to offer
a merely experimental “ Yes ” when the fateful question is popped by an eligible partner. Exactly how queer and how entertaining this book is can only be found out
by personal perusal. Press notices hitherto have mainly suggested a charm without doing much to define it. And as the germ of “ A Yellow Aster ” was found in
Australia, and the authors were for some time residents of Melbourne, the book has special interest for Australian readers. This edition is tastefully bound, and very
neatly printed.
“ THE LAST SENTENCE,”
By Maxwell Gray. 3s. lid.
HEINEMANN’S COLONIAL LIBRARY. Bvo., Cloth, 311 pp.
Many people will read this story with a great deal of pleasure and interest. “ The Silence of Dean Maitland,” by the same author, remains after many years a
prime favorite; and “A Last Sentence” is very similar in method and treatment. Several strong situations lead up to the climax, when a judge is called upon to
sentence to death his own daughter, and here the average novel-reader will thrill and palpitate with excitement. A like incident, indeed, is strongly, put in Lytton’s
“Paul Clifford and Franzos’ “ Chief Justice ;” and the author has found it necessary in a preface to deny having read either book. But, if a rose be sweet, what does it
matter that others have plucked one as sweet before us? Anyhow, “Paul Clifford” is forgotten, and “The Chief Justice” has never been known enough to be remem
bered. “ The Last Sentence ”is bound to have a great vogue.
“ THE PRISONER op ZEND A,”
By Anthony Hope. 2s. lOd.
MACMILLAN’S COLONIAL LIBRARY. Bvo., paper, 310 pp.
This story, to hand by the last mail, might easily have been told on the Thousand and Second Night. The hero suddenly finds himself masquerading as king of
a little German State during the indisposition of the rightful monarch, and the trouble that he has in defending his borrowed crown proves conclusively that there is
nothing in monarchy—in small German States. There is an adventure, with drawn revolvers and flashing sabres, on every page, and blood flows like colonial beer on a
navvies’ pay-day. Adventurous people whom unkind Fate has set to handle spades and flashing pens can read “ The Prisoner ” for a change.
“ THE RUBICON,”
By E. F. Benson. 2s. KM
BELL’S INDIAN AND COLONIAL LIBRARY. Bvo., Paper, 394 pp.
This is Mr. Benson’s second novel. His first, “ Dodo,” said to be a portrait of the lady who is making Mr. Asquith happy, came in the first flight of the rushing
throng which have exhibited London society as a leper asylum in evening dress. The lepers who cross “ The Rubicon ” give reason to think that their doctors and nurses
have a lively time of it. The lady leper, having been persuaded into a loveless marriage, makes herself so disagreeable that the gentleman leper, who isn’t a bad sort of a
leper at all, is glad to do it with prussic acid, or something. Then the lady arranges things badly with the other fellow, and across the brook she goes. Of course, such a
book is bound to be more or less the rage. And nobody can claim to be really up-to-date in end-of-the-century literature unless he (she) has taken a psychological dive into
the depths and shallows of “ The Rubicon.”
“TESS of the D’URBERYILLES,”
By Thomas Hardy. 2s. 10d.
BELL’S INDIAN AND COLONIAL LIBRARY. Bvo., Paper, 520 pp.
This is a cheap re-issue of a book adjudged three years ago to be a masterpiece of English fiction —a judgment which the lapse of time has strengthened and
confirmed. Thomas Hardy has no superior but George Meredith among contemporary novelists : with that noble exception he is peer of the highest. He is no mere
prattler of witticisms : his stories are not dummies for the display of a style filed and fitted to the ninth part of a hair ; he writes for Fame and Time, not to gratify a
false taste of the fickle, momentary public. In “Tess” he has given us of his best. Conception is as strong as execution. No wonder that the book startled Mrs. Grundy
in her strongholds. The author deliberately challenges conventions and prejudices, and declares that purity is an ethereal essence of the spirit, not of the body; that a
wronged woman may stand on a level with her of the most sheltered virtue ; and that there are saner and wider views of sex than those held by the diseased minds of
monkish mystics and incorporated in traditional religion. This edition is well printed in large type, and has an excellent portrait of the author.
“REMINISCENCES of the GREAT MUTINY,”
By W. Forbes-Mitchell. 2s. 10d.
MACMILLAN’S COLONIAL LIBRARY. Bvo., paper, 295 pp.; with maps.
A glimpse of the Indian Mutiny from the inside. The average historian, writing, as a rule, long after the events which he describes, has a difficulty in
identifying himself with the men who have moved them. Do what he will, they remain mere puppets of his mind, things extern and often unintelligible. The author of
these Reminiscences, a sergeant in the 93rd (Sutherland) Highlanders, saw the events which he chronicles; and his unpretentious narrative has a vigour and a thrill which
more studied performances frequently lack. The chief episode dealt with is the Siege of Lucknow. Many personal anecdotes are interspersed ; and the book, as a whole,
is readable and informing.

With prefatory note by
Rolf Boldrewood.
PRICE : : Is.
Posted to any Australian
Address, Is. 3d.
“ The volume takes its name from one of the sketches, ‘ The Last of Six,’ though in point of merit they all stand pretty well on a par. The
author, who is familiar with life in Northern Queensland, writes with vigour about the doings of the whites and the natives in these faraway
parte. A strong vein of mysticism runs through his narratives, and there are ghosts in almost every chapter, and for those who are,fond of
realistic work the volume will prove attractive reading.”—S.M. Hekald, July 8, 1893.
“No writer has given the world a more vivid description of Australia and its wilderness than Ernest Favenc, and the secret of this is that
ho has, by many years’ experience of travel and bush life, acquired a knowledge of this continent which is possessed by scarcely any other wxiter.
He, too, possesses great descriptive powers. Whatever he puts pen to is certain to be good. In the stories under notice he has given us some of
his best wonk. That they will be widely read is certain.” — Sydney Mail, July 8, 1893.
“ They present with force and vividness, as well as with the accuracy arising from long contact and keen observation, striking pictures of
parte of Australia unfamiliar to most of its inhabitants ; they tell, sometimes with remarkable power, of incidents such as happen in wild places
when human hearts are stirred by strong passions, and of weird imaginings that move the minds of lonely men. ‘ The Last of Six ’ is a terrible
tale of cannibalism, treachery, and revenge upon the dead, which in other hands might be gross and hideous, but which Mr. Favenc makes of
thrilling interest. ‘ The Haunt of the Jinkarras’ suggests Rider Haggard and his imitators to some'extent, but is itself relieved from the
suspicion of imitation by faithful local dolour and a grotesquerie of conception, in which Mr. Favenc here'and thei’c approaches Poe. This
characteristic is espeeially noticeable in ‘Spirit Led,’ which the great American might have written. ‘A Cup of Cold Water’ is, perhaps the
best tale in a collection that should be widely read, and which forms a worthy addition to .purely Australian literature.”— Daily Telegraph
July 15, 1893.
‘“The Last of Six ;’and other stories. By Ernest Favenc. (Sydney: The Bulletin Newspaper Co.) This is a •ollection of short but
graphic sketches by Mr. Favenc, the well-known explorer, who has a rare collection of Australian legendary lore. All the stories here are good,
and we can heartily endorse the -recommendatory notice by Rolf Boldrewood prefixed to this collection. The present issue forms the third of The
Bulletin series of Australian reminiscences.”— Australian Star, July 15,1893.

SALT-RHEUM,
SKIN DISEASE
Will quickly leave Its victim, when tlie
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
E. H. Stahl, of Des Moines, la., U. S. A.,
says: “My little daughter was, for seve-
ral years, afflicted with salt-rheum, none of
the many remedies prescribed by the physi-
cians doing her any good. "When we had
about given up all hope of curing her, my
wife suggested the use of Ayer’s Sarsapa-

The Caligraph Writing Machine.
~«■ 1
THE CaLIGRAPH embodies all the highest
developments of applied mechanics, and its
principle having stood the test of 15 years, its
success towers above the fantastic devices of mush-
room competitors.
“ I like Caligraph writing better than that of
any other'typewriter because the type comes out
so sharply and clearly.” The prominent Anglican
clergyman, who used these words, had hit upon
the chief characteristic of the Caligraph without
exactly knowing what brought it about. The
result is attributable to the fact that ths platen of
the Caligraph being bevelled the type strike
against a flat surface thus producing a full and
even impression. When you see typewriting with
only the middle of the letters clear you know that
the machine used was not a Caligraph, but one
fitted with the ordinary round platen. When you
read a typewritten letter, with some of the type
leaning to the right and the rest to the left, you
may be sure that your correspondent has a crude
machine, with curved typebars, which naturally
become more crooked, and thus twist their type
out of perpendicular. Then remember that the
Caligraph has straight typebars which, like every-
thing else in the machine, are fitted with adjust-
able bearings.
The Caligraph manifolds 15 carbon copies at
one operation, and used with the Edison Mimeo-
graph reduplicates 1500 copies from one stencil.

The Christs of Trade.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ From January ’B9 to October ’93, 154 men employed
on the Manchester ship canal were killed; 186 were
permanently crippled ; 1404 were temporarily disabled.”
—News Item.
Christs of the Age of Trade ! Martyrs of beams
and of bricks,
Dying to build up a bank where men shall be
bought and sold,
Finding your death on the plank, with the
scaffold for crucifix,
Taking your life in your teeth that the few
may be seized of gold
Martyrs who perish unduly —your life for your
meat give ye.
Your Archetype died for the million—you die
for a twain or three.
Building the mighty bridge for the freight of
the huckster’s wares,
Raising great Babel towers that dip in the
deep of the cloud,
Selling your life with the days—with the sweat
and the whitening of hairs—
High on the raking scaffold you build, while
you stitch your shroud—
Making an earth-broad progress that goes not
to you when made,
And leaving your blood on the stones of the
town of the Age of Trade.
Dully ye go to your slaughter, as long ago
went He—
Giving your life and your labour ever and
aye to the few—
And their claqueur, the chancelled priest, saying
Christ made yoxi free,
Lies for the sake of the spoilers, who fat on
the spoiling of you.
Patient and plodding as beasts, which know not
of death nor of life,
Paid by the bread that but feeds you to father
new slaves from your wife.
You build up the hall and the mansion, and
lo ! when your work is done,
Your sweat and your toil you hide in the hut
by the fever-drain ;
And you paint in rose and in chrome for the
eyes of the Prince’s son,
And then—to sleep in your hovel, if unhaply
ye be not slain
On the bloody cross of the scaffold which your
All and their Naught hath made,
In the land that is owned by Barabbas, O
Christs of the Age of Trade !
But a change comes swift for us all and ye
martyrs who bleed for the few—
Oh, men to whose tight-belted bellies your
, lives are for ever in pawn !
For that breath of a wakened people called
“ God ” shall bequeath us anew
The land and the sea and the Chances, and a
Deodand true shall be Dawn,
And the thing which you think and you make
shall be yours when ’tis thought and
made,
And your lives and your sweat shall be yours
at the death of the Age of Trade.

RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
Tennyson Smith, the temperance talker,
seems to have had a great and glorious time at
Daylesford (Vic.). His mission ended with an
enthusiastic packed meeting, whereat men, women
and children unanimously condemned the inaction
of two local policemen who “failed to suppress ”
malcontents at a previous gathering. The lecturer
was then escorted home by the faithful “amid
showers of rotten eggs and other missiles.” The
old story. Teetotalism asserts itself quite un-
necessarily, with the result that a number of
harmless people retaliate by getting drunk. Death-
less fame awaits the man who first carries the
gospel of moderate drinking to swipers. A good
title for his one immortal address would be—The
Philosophy of Alcohol.
The successful removal of Piles of the
most stubborn description is being effected by
bharp s new “ Cannalin ” treatment, large quan-
tities of which are being forwarded to sufferers
throughout the colonies. It is obtainable, with
advice, from 257 George-street, Sydney.
The imported newspaper of the dust-bin
order, like Scraps, Tit-Bits, Answers, etc., is a
| fearful and a wonderful thing. Its knowledge of
things Australian is generally its strongest point.
lor instance, Answers, of May 26th, 1894 in an
article on relics of Australian criminals, ladles out
the following facts’ to its unsuspecting readers :
1. “ Messrs. Bailey " (meant for Bay lee) “the Melbourne
auctioneers.
2. “ Ned Kelly’s armour was padded ” (lie).
3. “ Captain Standish still retains a pipe,” &c. (Cap-
tain Standish has been dead about 15 years).
. 4 ;,“.? uperintendent Kennedy, the bluff and genial chief
of Melbourne detective police,” &c. (Kennedy retired
eight months ago, and wasn’t genial).
5. “Mr. Shegog, governor of the Melbourne gaol.” &c.
(Shegog retired about two years ago).
6- “In Melbourne gaol one may inspect a greatquantitv
of the ropes used in the performance of the capital
punishment.” (Lie.) *
7. “Colston, the Narbethony murderer.”
8. “The woman Sheehan, from whose back-garden
the bodies of numerous infants,” &c.
9. “ Detective Considine and the Governor of the Mel-
bourne gaol were openly approached with an offer of £2O
for one of Deeming’s little fingers.” (Lie.)
10. “The little fingers of Deeming are in the possession
of two colonial collectors." (Lie.)
Now, if anyone has any questions to ask about
Australia he will know where not to get reliable
Answers.
Nervous sufferers will find it worth their
while to peruse Herr Rassmussen’s advt. on Dace
19 of this issue.

Professor TODD, Anderson’s College Medical

writes :
It is a lighter, clearer, and more ethereal oil than any
I have hitherto used, besides being free from the heavy
nauseous odour characteristic of others.
This is particularly noticeable when the oil is sprayed
into the throat.
It is very palatable when taken internally, which places
it above other preparations, and considerably enhances its
value.

To Critics.
(A poetic aticgory bared on a acientific fact.)
Jt chanced with morning’s gladsome light
Within a garden’s precincts bright,
An earthworm came to day ;
Long used to deep Cimmerian gloom
He left for once his living tomb
And burst his bonds of clay.
He sunned himself in wormish'glee,
And pondered deep when swift (Ah, me !)
A feathered foe drew nigh ;
With one swift blow of bitter pain
He cleft the wriggler clean in twain,
Then sought his native sky.
How beautiful are Nature’s laws I
How sweetly ’twixt Effect and Cause
Her harmonies are bred !
Our worm went back without a wail
And wondered deep—within his tail—
What fiend had got his head.
Our worm went back (for worms will turn),
And there within his gloomy bourn
Filled out as moments sped ;
Grew fat and full and whole once more
While sated with his stolen store
The pirate bird was fed.
a And would,” the wondering poet cried,
“ My critic friend this sight had spied,
And thence a lesson ta’en;
Would half my corse could stop his maw.
And t’other half might then withdraw
And grow in peace again! ”
Q.
P. LUFTIG.
Placed him right away. Office-Boy ;
"Man outside, sir, who says he ain’t had a square

“Denticure” is the latest occupation on
record in England. A dentiourist is simply a
person who makes a living by cleaning other
people’s teeth. Her customers are wealthy per-
sons who are too profoundly bored to clean their
own teeth, and there are so many of these, it
seems, that the new art promises to boom. The
hopelessly-bored aristocrat of Europe can now get
her toe-nails and finger-nails attended to and her
hands and feet generally supervised by contract;
also, she can get her head and her dog washed,
and her hair supervised, and her teeth cleaned,
and the colour of her nose taken care of by private
tender, By-and-bye all these branches of the art
will be taken in hand by a joint-stock co., and
then the exhausted peeress will be let out as one
contract, instead of being done by instalments as
at present. The bloated monopoly always comes
along sooner or later.
A London paper, professedly democratic,
was moved to tears by a recent pilgrimage of
Albert Edward and wife to darkest Poplar. Hear
the free and independent cockney on this great
national event! “ Among the teeming millions of
the East-end—yes, millions! for nobody knows
what London is who has not been three miles east
of the Bank—there must have been many who
were setting eyes on royalty, the other day, for
the first time, like that poor little sufferer in the
Poplar Hospital for Accidents, who timidly ad-
dressed the august lady bending over her bed as
‘Mrs. Prinoess of Wales.’ Mrs. Princess of
Wales 1 What a world of pathos there is in the
salutation coming from that poor East-end child,
unversed in the etiquette of courts!” What
a world of fiddle-dee-dee ! The man who wrote
that paragraph will never understand where the
pathos of the child’s address came in, any more
than he would realise the true pathos of his own
position if he were planked down in the presence
of the Shah and told to worship that barbarian in
the orthodox Persian manner. The thought of a
married woman having any “ higher ” title than
Mum ” is the only thing that strikes The Bul-
letin in a saddening way. Princesses and Court-
invented titles are pathetic— not so the plebeian
ignorance of their awful importance. We do not
wipe our eyes as we think of the voung lady at the
Adelaide bazaar, who up to musical
William Robinson (the Excellency of the period)
md said, with a nervous smile “ Can’t I tempt
fou, ‘ Governor,’ to buy something ? ”

There is a land where summer skies
Are gleaming with a thousand dyes,
Blending in witching harmonies,

And grassy knoll and forest height
Are flushing in the rosy light,
And all above is azure bright,
Australia! Australia! Australia!
There is a land where honey flows,

A proud flag waves exultingly,

SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 1894.
The Western Insurrection.
That shearers’ difficulty, which is now
almost a chronic trouble in the West, has
further developed, within the last few weeks,
into a kind of burlesque civil war in the
remoter parts of New South Wales. From
pure force of habit even the democrats of
Australia generally allude to thk, recur-
rent upheaval as a shearers’ “ strike,” but,
in the present instance, as in many others,
the term is a misnomer. In 1891, a per-
manent agreement was arrived at between
the pastoralists and their employes, present
and future, according to which shearing was
to be done on certain terms and conditions.
In 1894, the pastoralists deliberately broke
this agreement, and thereby went on strike
against their employes. The men adhered
faithfully to the terms of their contract; the
masters proved, for the twentieth time,
that their solemn pledge was a lie, and
their word of honor was a falsehood, and
that there was neither truth nor honesty in
them. The new agreement, which they
sought to substitute for their broken
promise, was, moreover, so one-sided and so
gratuitously insulting that it must needs
lead to trouble under any circumstances.
It not only reduced wages and broke many
of the minor terms of the old agreement,
but it contained a proviso that the pastora-
iist’s representative was to be the only court
of appeal in all disputes, and his decision
was to be final. This sweeping clause
covered everything ; it placed the relations
of the two parties on such a basis that the
man who sheared 2000 sheep might only be
paid for 50, simply because the squatter’s
menial, under instructions from his master,
gave his final decision that that was the
whole number shorn. Also, he might not
be paid for any at all, if the same menial
gave his verdict to that effect, and the
shearer, having signed away his right of
redress, must acquiesce in the decision. In
fact, under the agreement of 1894, the
squatter’s authority was limited only by the
risk of having his brains knocked out by his
enraged employes. Apart from that hazard,
the agreement, read literally, allowed him to
defraud his subordinates to whatever extent
he pleased.
# • •
The former treaty was made between the
united pastoralists and the whole class of
shearers, and when the pastoralists thus
declared war every shearer in Australia had
a distinct right to take up the challenge.
But, though a great wrong had been done, the
law provided no remedy. Where one man
enters into a formal engagement to employ
another on certain terms, and breaks that
engagement for no reason save that he
chooses to do so, the law does provide a
remedy. The remedy, it is true, is usually a
great deal more expensive than the original
injury, but, in a ghastly sort of way, it is a
remedy. Where an association agrees to
employ a certain class of men on certain
terms, the engagement can be broken with
absolute impunity. What the law does by
way of redress is to send out police and
military to overawe the defrauded class if it
objects in any way to be defrauded. Also,
it allows the persons who committed the
original outrage to sit on the bench as
honorary magistrates and send their swindled
employes to gaol for objecting too openly.
Under these circumstances all the riot and
confusion now pervading the troubled West,
all the incendiarism, the destruction of pro-
perty, the burning of steamers, the pro-
miscuous shooting—most of it very bad
shooting—the kidnapping of non-unionists,
the assaults and threats of murder, though
foolish and utterly unjustifiable, are quite
intelligible.
* # •
The situation of the shearer, provided he
keeps within the bounds of thelaw, is just this:
he must either agree that he is an individual
with no rights or privileges—a person with
whom no employer need keep faith unless he
pleases, and must sign away his claim to
legal redress no matter to what extent he is
swindled and defrauded, no matter how he
is fed, lodged and paid, or left unpaid—or he
must lose his occupation entirely, and starve
as unobtrusively as he can. And under
similar conditions, The Bulletin ventures to
prophesy that the Bar, and even the Church,
and the fatted capitalists of the Upper House,
and the owners and editors of all the re-
spectable, profoundly serious," and Tory
newspapers in Australia, and the pompous
mercantile dignitaries of the Exchange, and
the great land-holders of the country, and
the whole combined representatives of Law
and Order—that all these classes, or at least
70 per cent, of them, would go out and run
amok , and commit pillage and arson just
as the infuriated bushmen of the West
are now doing. It prophesies to this
effect, not because pillage and arson are
justifiable or profitable under any circum-
stances, for they certainly are not, but
because human nature is much the same
wherever it is met with. If it were possible
that a Government of the shearers’ variety
should ever come into power in Australia,
and if it oppressed the capitalist as the latter
has oppressed the bush labourer, then the
aggregate Fat Man of the country would
probably go round in turbulent mobs, and
destroy property, and drag a fire-stick across
the country, just as his employ d is now
doing. And if he were found doing it he
would get a long term in gaol, just as the
present insurrectionary bushman is likely to
do.
• « •
The best thing that can happen is that the
Western insurrection—it is no use calling it
by any of the feeble designations with which
the routine press tries to cloak its real
dimensions—should be put down as quickly
as possible, and with as little newspaper
frenzy as may be. The Bulletin, whose
sympathies are all with the workers, says
this deliberately and advisedly. It is an
aimless, purposeless, burlesque uprising
which is foredoomed to defeat because its
leaders have no idea whither they are
going ; therefore, the sooner the agony is
ended the better. Regarded as an insurgent
the Anglo-Saxon is the worst failure beneath
the sun, and the Australian is a worse failure
than many other Anglo-Saxons. He tries to
combine civil war with an outward respect,
in certain isolated instances, for law-and-
ordor, and the two things are incompatible.
The Western shearers gather in small armies
-—compared to the available police they may
safely be called armies—and are cheerfully
prepared to encounter any reasonable num-
ber of miscellaneous combatants on the other
side. Yet they often allow their leaders to
be captured before their eyes by a handful of
policemen, merely to show that they are
still law-abiding citizens, and that the
divinity which hedges in a “copper” has
not been entirely forgotten. The avowed
object of the uprising is to terrorise the pas-
toralists into submission, but an uprising
conducted in such a fashion is not calculated
to terrorise anybody. Next to the folly of
insurrection in any case, the folly of trying
to insurrect in a partially law-abiding
fashion stands out conspicuously. The most
rudimentary axiom in the science and mys-
tery of rebellion is that, when once the dis-
affected party begins to break the law, it
must be prepared to fight all the forces of
the law to the bitter end and wipe them out
—or else itmust lose. If the Western shearers
propose to win by force—and they have
evidently decided that they cannot win
without force—then they must be prepared
to march on Sydney, and scatter the police
and the military forces, and depose or hang
Governor Burr, and sack the I,_.nistry, and
clear out both Houses of Parliament, and
start a Republic. Whether such a proceed-
ing would do them any good is exceedingly
doubtful, but certainly nothing short of it will.
The party which proposes to achieve its pur-
pose by breaking the law must be prepared
to break the whole law ; the attempt to win
by bruising one corner of some solitary
statute is ludicrous and imbecile. The Sleuth
American understands this ; when he com-
mences an insurrection he heads his forces
straight for the capital with a dogged resolve
to kill whomsoever opposes him or be killed
himself. The Australian rebel, cruising
feebly around on a dry plain, burning an
occasional woolshed in a sneaking sort of
way, and calling the police bad names when
they arrest his leaders, is a spectacle to be
laughed at by gods and men.
/ • * *
The Bulletin’s sympathies are with
the shearers because they were wronged
in the first instance, and the law re-
fused them any redress. With the
shearer individually it is more difficult
to sympathise. He is a person with few
ambitions, who is mostly content to be a
servant and a wage-earner all his days. He
never had, like the average Maorilander, an
intense resolve to become, sooner or later,
an independent settler, therefore he is now
meeting with the fate of wage-earners in
general. He follows loyally the same old,
hopeless leaders whose one idea in every
difficulty is the same old, hopeless expedient.
Under present conditions, the chance of
winning, no matter how just his cause,
by the “ strike ” pure and simple—
by merely sitting passively outside his
employer’s gate—is just about as good
as the chance of putting back the uni-
verse. The odds are so enormous that the
result is hardly in doubt even for an instant.
The attempt to win by violent means, unless
his leaders are willing to stake their lives on
the result and die, like any other unsuccess-
ful revolutionists, if luck goes against them,
is equally poor. And even if they were so
prepared, their prospects would probably be
about as bad as they are now ; the only
redeeming feature would be that the episode
would make a rather more respectable
figure in history. The only prospect seems
to lie in legislation, which will place
the pastoralist, or the Broken Hill mine-
owner, with his perpetually broken agree-
ment, on the same level as any other con-
tracting party ; which will render arbitration
compulsory, and fix a minimum wage in all
occupations. How to construct a workable
system of compulsory arbitration is about
the most difficult question of the age,
but the attempt must be made sooner or
later. The'rending asunder of the Labor-party
by the feuds and arrogance of the L.E.L.
has not served, however, to bring it any
nearer, A few years ago much might have
been accomplished by co-operation, but
unionism has been weakened and its funds
dissipated in a long series of conflicts—mostly
just ones, but conflicts that were hideously
mismanaged and generally hopeless from the
beginning. And now the sinews of war are
wanting. Moreover, there is every reason to
fear that they will continue wanting for a
long while to come. For the present, at all
events, there is hardly a gleam of hope any-
where for the insurrectionists. They are an
army which has no plan, no distinct purpose
in view, and which is going nowhere in par-
ticular, and such an army—whether its cause
is good or bad—always comes to a bad end.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Patterson's Programme.
The Patterson Government, having fallen on
its stomach, like Dagon, and gone to pieces, is
dissolving Parliament and appealing to the
people of Victoria. J. B. Patterson has still
a lingering idea that the people of Victoria
want him badly, and won’t part with him at
any price—hence this new political develop-
ment. It is truly pathetic, however, to read
that Patterson proposes to cast himself on the
bosom of the country with a new policy, the
leading features of which are an income-tax, an
absentee-tax, more retrenchment,ahdareduction
of the Assembly from 95 members to 70. If Pat-
terson would say definitely ho w much incomeand
absentee-tax he intends to levy it might help him
a little, but even that information would pro-
bably come too late. Australia, in general, is
unutterably tired of these beautiful programmes
which never come to anything. Patterson
showed not the slightest sign of a desire to levy
an income or absentee-tax while his billet was
still secure, and his sudden longing to enforce
them now that las job is slipping away
from him is only a horrible example of
death-bed repentance. If the country sends
its britcher-man back with a small majority he
won’t be able to carry his proposals, and if it
sends him back with a big majority he won’t
attempt to carry them, for Patterson is never
likely to tax wealth except under compulsion.
Therefore, there is every reason why he should
not be sent back at all. Moreover, even an
income and absentee-tax combined are insuffi-
cient o fill the awful gap in the exchequer.
Victoria wants, in addition, a new land-tax—
a small tax on the small landholder who
occupies his own patch of soil and puts it to
some useful purpose ; a bigger one on the ] a ,.„„
landholder who does likewise; a larger on
again on the large landholder who lets lu S p ro e
perty and lives on the rents; a still heavier
one on the person who holds vacant land merely
for a rise and thus blocks settlement; and on
top of all these a devastating tax on the
absentee who takes his profits out of the
country, just when the country wants them so
badly. It wants a lot of other things besides
but a genuine land-tax like the above, which
would produce about .£600,000 per annum in
revenue, is the first essential. And as
Patterson doesn’t promise anything like* this
even in his death-bed repentance, and wouldn’t
carry it out seriously if he did promise it, it i s
time for him to go. His rival, George Turner
is not much more promising, but the summary
execution of Patterson may encourage him to
keep straight. If it doesn’t, the summary
execution of Turner, a little later on, may
encourage someone else to keep straight
Patterson, however, can’t be kept straight by
any known process. If the ghoul of Castle-
maine returns with a good majority, he will
only be thereby convinced that the country
can’t do without hkn, no matter how he conducts
himself, and he will go round to more banquets
than ever, and preach his gospel of “ confi-
dence ” with renewed vigor, and rend the
welkin with his horrid laugh more assiduously
than before, and the end of Patterson will be
worse, if possible, than the beginning.
A Modern Buccaneer.
So far, we have only two Australian novels—
“ His Natural Life,” by Marcus Cearke, and
“ Robbery under Arms,” by Mr. T. A. Browne
(“ Rolf Boldrewood”). Mr. Browne’s genius
is of the plodding order; he is apter at com-
pilation than composition ; and, but for scattered
passages of occasional merit, his later works
would be already forgotten. Yet a new book
from the author of “Robbery under Arms”
must always be of moment; and when, three
months ago, “ A Modern Buccaneer, by Rolf
Boldrewood,” was published in Loudon, the
critics read it eagerly. Of course, the critics
did not know the peculiar history of the book
as given in last week’s Bulletin. They did
not know that Mr. Browne had purchased
from Mr. Louis Becke the manuscript narra-
tive of his experiences while supercargo with
Bully Haves, the South Sea pirate—giving him
£25 or .£3O, which Becke, then unknown to
literature, and not too wealthy, was probably
glad to accept. They did not know that, as
Becke’s story by itself was insufficient to fill
more than two of the conventional three volumes
of the London publishers, Boldrewood padded
it out with a third volume, detailing the adven-
tures of the nondescript “Hilary Telfer.” They
did not know that Boldrewood would edit
Becke’s work in masterly fashion by omitting
some passages, interpolating other passages in
which “Hilary Telfer” moralises as a magis-
trate might moralise to a Monday drunkard, and
by converting a one-armed man named Proctor
into a one-legged man named Kyte. They
did not know that Becke’s narrative, with
style and matter substantially unchanged,
occupies nearly the whole of the first two
volumes in the three-volume edition, and
some 200 pages out of 368 in the one-volume
edition. The critics did not know these things:
how could they ? For it appears that by some
uever-sufficiently-to-be- wept over mischance the
book was published simply as “ A Modern Buc-
caneer, by Rolf Boldrewood,” without a word
to hint that considerably more than half the
matter was contributed by Louis Becke. The
careless publishers even went so far as to omit
a preface pointing out that, as regarded the
staple of the book, Becke was the real author,
and Boldrewood only the editor. But
Boldrewood, true to the best traditions of
literary chivalry, hastened to repair the omission
by printing, only a month after the book had
reached Australia, the following acknowledg-
ment (Aug. 15 and 16) :
mo THE EDITOR OF THE SYDNEY
x MORNING HERALD.
Dear Sir, — I desire to acknowledge my indebtedness to
Mr. Louis Becke, author of “ By Reef and Palm,” for the
South Sea Island portion of “ A Modern Buccaneer," ex-
cepting the chapter headed “ Poisoned Arrows,” whicli
was founded on a diary of a whaling cruise by my late
lather.
T. A. BROWNE.
Albury, 13th August, 1894.
This full and generous amende was not buried
among other reading matter, for Mr. Browne
doubtless knows that nobody reads the Herald
correspondence : it was displayed in prominent
type (as shown) on the very first page of the
paper, among several hundred other advertise-
ments, where everybody would be sure to
notice it. But the critics could not foresee
these things, and it must be an inexpressible
grief to Rolf Boldrewood to read the praises
(Becke’s praises) which have been heaped upon
him. For example, The Bookman, a com-
paratively new literary journal which stands
already in the first critical rank, says in its
June number
The great blot on this good story is the third volume
[Boldrewood'B volume], . . . Indeed, the story in the
first two volumes [Becke's two volumes] is admirably
told, having all.the look of a record of actual adventure
[Becke’s actual adventure] only trimmed enough so as to
leave out the irrelevant matter which is apt to creep into
real accounts written d premier coup. The descriptions
[Becke's descriptions] of scenery, natives, and trading,
legitimate and otherwise, in Samoa and the other South
Sea Islands, are admirable, and we have no hesitation in
saying that, so far as the writing is concerned, “A Modern
Buccaneer ” is the best thing Mr. Boldrewood has done.
But, we repeat, the .third volume [encore Boldrbwood'3
third volume] is a mistake.
Then The Academy, one of the best-known of
purely literary English journals, writes on
June 23:
The final volume [Boldrkwood’s] is the most agreeable
of the three, but it is a superfluity, if not an excrescence.
• . . The two first volumes [Becke's] are in every way
admirable. . . It is also but fair to Rolf Boldrewood
to say that in compactness of plot and crispness of style
“ A Modern Buccaneer” is a distinct advance upon any-
thing he has yet published.
The London Daily Chronicle, too, says o:
May 10 :
We do not forget either “ Robbery Under Arms ” or ai
of its various successors when we say that Rolf Boldri.
wood has never done anything so good as “ A Modern
Buccaneer.”
And the Australian press, if less critical, is
hardly less complimentary. Melbourne Table


Talk calls the book “ the best Australian nove
ve t published ”; though Sydney Star un-
kindly prefers “Bully Hayston ” (drawn by
Bkoke) to “ Hilary Telfer ” (drawn by Boldre-
wood); and S.M. Herald still more unkindly
remarks that “Telfer moralises to put one
to sleep.” But, of course, the Herald did
, n ot know. Doubtless, now that Mr. Browne
has begun to acknowledge his debt to
Becke, he will let all the critics
know. For he sits upon the Bench to
dispense justice, and his keen sense of justice
-will not allow him to rest even with the wide
publicity of a half-inch advertisement in the
Svdney papers. He is sure to take immediate
steps to acquaint the London critics with their
error ; and he may even recall the edition of his
book to insert his magnanimous acknowledg-
ment.
Are We a Force People?
Dear Bulletin —One of Parkes’ stock phrases
j s “ the furee hinstitooshuns of a furee people,”
/meaning us). Premier Reid is also learning to
yell the phrase. This induces me to ask the above
question. The answer is—Yes : theoretically
we are ; practically, we ain’t. There are many
points of difference between Australians and a
free people. Take the question of police. Con-
trast the conduct of these gentry with that of
the police of other nations. Take England
first. In London the police are justly regarded
as the acme of paternal benevolence. A police-
man will take a duchess on his arm over a cross-
ing, or he will stop a Duke’s carriage to let a
poor old man or woman across the street. He
will, at a heavy traffic corner, stop in turn a
stream of carriages to allow a cross stream of
donkey-carts to go past—and then reverse the
process, giving the flunkeys precedence of the
donkeys. He will take under his protection a
drunken man, help him in the direction of
home to the limit of his own beat, and hand
him over there to the policeman opposite,
who continues the process until the in-
ebriate is finally delivered like a parcel
at his own house. A London police-
man will direct you anywhere from Bromp-
ton to Berlin, put you in a ’bus or train,
show you where to purchase a ticket, and thank
—actually thank you—for your tip. He will
with equal accuracy tell you the time and the
truth on all occasions. He is looked up to by
the people, reverenced, worshipped as a guar-
dian deity. You rarely hear of assaults on the
police. Englishmen frequently beat their wives,
but never their policemen. The man who raises
his hand to a policeman, save in an act of kind-
ness, is a wretch whom it would be gross flattery
to call coward, and gross carelessness to call
brute. A policeman there is a man and a
brother. The humorist who asserted that a
policeman’s lot is not a happy one has never
risen higher than a comic-opera librettist, with
the accent on the first syllable. Now, compare
this nobleman with the “ colonial ” article.
The latter is very often a splendid fellow, but
he is much too frequently a bully and brute—
whose favorite prey is the accidentally-drunk,
upon whom he pounces like a starved dingo, and
drags away to the lock-up. If the inebriate
tries to explain, he is charged with riotous
behavior ; if he falls down, resisting the police;
if he holds on to the policeman to steady him-
self, tearing Her Majesty’s uniform. When
the case comes on in court—a furee court of
justice in a furee country—the magistrate
is the sworn ally of the bobby. If a large
concourse of highly reputable citizens swear
the culprit was sober, and one policeman swears
the reverse, the beak believes the latter, and
practically finds the former guilty of unanimous
and preconcerted perjury. Of all the crimes
perpetrated in the name of Justice, the worst is
the acceptation of the theory that the policeman
can do no wrong, and that the civilian can never
do right when a policeman is present. Com-
pare the quality of the police court evidence,
where the civilians’ and the police testimonies
conflict. Civilians agree generally upon main
points and differ upon details. The police
evidence tallies to the minutest detail. Indeed,
as you once remarked in The Bulletin, if
there are 20 policemen, you have only to take
the first bobby’s evidence and multiply it by 20
to secure the inevitable result. A policeman’s
evidence is always corroborative of the preced-
ing one’s. “The evidence of Constable A. was
corroborated by Constables 8., C. and D.,” &c.
In short, their evidence is a perfect corro-
borative corroboree. The “standing by” of
brother Judges fades into insignificance when
compared with that of brother policemen.
I have seen a sleepy sergeant of police nodding
in court while a prisoner was being tried, and
when the formal question was put from the
Bench, whether the prisoner w T as known, he
woke up suddenly, and, without looking at the
unfortunate victim, give the usual “Oh yes,
yer worship, we know him !” This, as every-
one knows, weighs in the sentence given, and,
despite the prisoner’s protests that he had
never been before a court in his life, and that
there is no sworn evidence to prove that he
bad, the casual parrot-cry of a sleepy bobby
sends him to gaol. Having got so far, there is
no space to say anything about the police and
gendarmerie of other nations. Generally
speaking, they are better than ours, with
the exception of the Russian force, which
runs us close. My conscience tells me you
will ask a remedy. Well, my remedy is: Give us
»• proper creation of elective local governing
authorities over every inch of every pro-
vince, and place the control of the police in
the hands of those authorities, as is done almost
all over England. Sack the man who makes
the most arrests, and promote the fellow who
keeps order on his beat without needless inter-
ference. Abolish the savage presumption that
a drop too much is a crime, and instruct magis-
trates, judges, and others that a policeman’s
evidence is to be taken for what it is worth
merely— not as scientific and unimpeachable
revelation.. In short, give the policeman’s evi-
dence par value in all Courts of Justice, and
relinquish the custom of discounting the testi-
mony of civilians. When you have done this
the power of the Australian police will cease to
be, as it is now, malevolent; and will become,
like that of the London bobby, impartial, good-
humored, and benevolent.—Yours, Geebunu.
Australian Grovel as an Export.
The Colonial Institute people—prompted by
Mr. Duncan Gillies, who was inspired by Mr.
James Brown Patterson —have, with all the
impudence of ignorance, besought Lord Rose-
bery to order a new bank holiday for Great
Britain, whereon the masses may rejoice over
the birth of their Sovereign Lady. This is the
Pattersonian conception of a great stroke of
foreign policy, and he mentally brackets
it with his invitation to the Duke of
York. The ringleaders of Australian Snobbery
were lately twitted once more in The Bul-
letin with the absurdity of their Birthday
grovel, which has been foisted upon this
country to the amusement, or hearty disgust, of
ail British-born residents. May 24 is an
annual reminder that the worship of royalty
here has been carried to a point never dreamt
of “at home,” and as soon as the new-
made knight saw this fact being rubbed
into the public skin by democratic
operators he wrote to Agent-General Gillies
suggesting the appeal to Lord Rosebery. In
asking the British Prime Minister to adopt
a purely colonial view of “loyalty” the
Institute was practically asking him to save its
inventors and supporters from further contempt.
The blatant snob, in his suit of brass, is
secretly susceptible to ridicule, and would fain
get his un-English grovel Anglicised. Then
he would be able to point to another matter in
which Australia had taken the lead instead of
having made itself merely a laughing-stock for
amazed new-chums. It was characteristic of
the pompous pretenders who misrepresent Aus-
tralian sentiment in London that they should
presume to do this thing. The tailless cat,
suggesting a general amputation of tails,
was not more pitiably foolish than these
fat agents for Patterson and Co. The
answer flung at their heads by a born aristocrat
and hereditary disciple of the Monarch was
positively crushing. He told them, in effect,
that if the people of England (for Lubbock’s
bank-holiday bill was essentially an English
measure) felt any sudden desire to get drunk in
honour of Queen Victoria they could signify
the same in the usual manner and get drunk by
Act of Parliament, but no Government would
thrust the Birthday holiday upon them. Rose-
bery also pointed out, in order to close the
question with a snap, that May 24 is always
adjacent to Whit Monday, the greatest beer-
festival of the English year. Apart from the
Institute’s impudence in nominating any sort of
holiday for people whom it has no claim to
represent, there was the rabid stupidity of
supposing that those people attached the least
importance to Queen’s Birthday. The event
is about 56 years old, and during all that
time no exponent of public opinion has hinted
at a popular disposition to knock off work and
go in for national merrymaking on May 24.
The Institute imbeciles cannot understand that
the holiday would surely have been dragged
into existence by the Tory party but for some
antagonistic force. Would not the theatrical
Disraeli have created a gorgeous Birthday
demonstration ? Did the Queen herself never
entertain an idea of “encouraging loyalty” in
that way ? Of course she did, and, equally of
course, her tactful counsellors told her that the
idea had danger in it. A statesman studies
the national temper in matters of “loyalty.”
A Colonial Institute person merely looks
at the pictures of royal proceedings in
the Grarhic, and deludes himself with the
belief that the populace are panting for a
chance to express “strong personal attach-
ment ” to the Throne at the cost of a day’s
wages. The least thoughtful of them, who
cheer the Queen because she is the chief feature
in a spectacular display, would object to having
her “bloomin’ birthday” shoved down their
throats. Australians overlook the circumstance
that they have really known but one British
monarch, whilst Britain nurses traditions of
many whowere openly despised. The last King
was Silly Billy ; his predecessor had been, in his
pre-monarchial days, warned off Newcastle
Heath for roguery. The birthday of Charles
the First was not glorified by Act of Parliament.
In short, Hinglaud has never been as truly
loyal as a Colonial Institute would have liked
to make it.
Two hundred more Japs have just been landed
at Kanackay (Q.) to aid in realising Miss
Floral Shaw’s ideal of a mongrel aristocracy
built up by serf-labour in the beautiful sugar
industry. The planters’ organs lie infamously
in saying that no white labour is available ; and
the Govt, publicly professes to be “conciliat-
ing ” Japan not to send any more, while sub
rosa it joins the banks in encouraging the
traffic. And all the time the Labour-party is
quiescent, guided by leaders imbued with
Southern prejudices, who dislike to have their
authority dwarfed and contend that Separation
is of no importance, though nothing but Separa-
tion can enable Northern whites to control
foreign labour, fostered by preponderant
Southern interests. But it is worth noting
that the employers of these Japanese are not
large planters, but small farmers, who, not con-
tent with working the small areas of land which
they can profitably cultivate by themselves, are
just as eager as capitalists to possess large estates
and grow rich on cheap labor. Laborer Jack,
who takes up a piece of land and starts to grow
sugar, will not employ laborer Dick to help him
at 15s. a week if he can get a Kanaka for 10s.
Greed is not by any means confined to the
capitalist class. So the permanent interests of
the province are, bit by bit, yielded to the cove-
tousness of unscrupulous individuals; and
every day more vested rights are being created
which will by-and-by clamor loudly for com-
pensation when it is proposed to clean the sty
from which they grow.
The latest political news in New South Wales
is that Reid’s alleged Freetrade Ministry
doesn’t intend to interfere with the existing
duties until some time in 1895 —in other words,
that it won’t begin saving the country till
then. The finances of New South Wales have
been steadily improving and business in general
has been gradually looking up under the Dibbs
tariff, and they will probably continue to do so
until Reid’s revenue tariff-comes along, and
whatever advantage is gained m the interim
will be set down to “ Free trade.” It is
finally decided, however, that there is to be no
Freetrade at all. The new Government pro-
poses to raise <£1,000,000 by land and income-
tax, and £1,500,000 by Customs duties, which
is nearly as much as was raised by its prede-
cessors ; therefore the principal difference
between the old system and the new one lies in
Reid’s assurance that the Foreign-trade tariff
won’t help along any industry, or give work to
anyone, or enrich the province in any way, but
will simply bring in revenue and raise prices.
The gall which can present such a programme
as that and call it Freetrade is Alpine in its
magnitude.
In Melbourne, the other day, a very small
case in which an insolvent estate was concerned
culminated in a lawyer’s bill for £239. It was
a kind of friendly case in which the parties
applied for directions as to what was to be
done with a sum of £137, and the defendant
objected strongly to paying £239, in addition
to his own bill, in order to be informed how to
pay £137. The court sympathised with him,
and indignantly reduced the bill to £3l 10s.
Every now and then a Judge does something of
this sort, or if he doesn’t the prothonotary does
it, and the public regards it as a healthy protest
against the enormity of legal charges in general.
But, in reality, it is nothing of the kind.
When the losing party is directed to pay the
winner’s costs, and the said costs are cut
down by a justly - incensed official from
£6OO to £2OO, or something like that, the
lawyer doesn’t lose the difference ; as a general
rule he simply charges it to his own client and
“gets there just the same.” The only result is
that instead of the man who was adjudged to
be in the wrong being ruined by the legal bill,
it bankrupts the man who was adjudged to be
in the right. Under such circumstances the
law might just as well give up protesting
against exorbitant law' charges. The only effect
of its protest is to shift a great part of the
liability from the right party to the wrong one,
while the person against whom the grievance
really exists loses nothing.
The seventeen Trades Hall-marked Labor-men
in Q. Parliament have determined to “ chuck”
the straight Opposition, and show the world
what an unholy mess they can make of things
by themselves. If they were able to learn
wisdom from experience, they would already
have been convinced of the lolly of their pro-
ceedings. The debate on the appointment of a
conciliation committee to settle the bush-strike
might have been forced on and finished in a
fortnight, had it been engineered by an experi-
enced parliamentarian. As it is, the horrid
thing has been hanging fire for six weeks. It
was started with a motion by Mr. Glassey’s
lieutenant, which meant nothing, and was con-
temptuously accepted by the Premier and flung
into the waste-paper basket; and a delay of
fourteen days. Then Glassey himself tried
another motion, which, after a further
delay, was ruled out of order by the Speaker,
and likewise went into the W.P.B. Now, the
third is supposed to be in course of discussion,
but the Government, having said all it wants
to say, and believing that it has had the
best of the argument so far, doesn’t intend to
allow it to come on any more, unless, indeed, it
manages to get a few minutes now and then on
a Thursday afternoon. Six weeks passed, and
the only result achieved is that the opponents of
a conference have plastered the country with
speeches which are marvels of misrepresenta-
tion ! The debate being now practically
stopped, Labour in Parliament has no chance
of replying for an indefinite time. Meanwhile,
the whole capitalistic crowd is consumed with
laughter to think that the giant Labor,
whom it so mightily fears outside, should
prove to be a harmless booby in the legislative
arena.
In October, 1890, High Commissioner Thur'
ston told the special correspondent of the S.M*
Herald that he considered the restriction pro-
hibiting British subjects in the New Hebrides
from selling arms and ammunition “ a most
advisable one,” although these alleged British
traders made it their pet grievance for this
reason:—
“ For instance,” said Thurston, “ they (meaning the
Australasian and English syndicates that want to ‘shark’
the group) made representations a short time ago (depu-
tation of influential Sydney men and one parson to Pre-
mier Dibbs) to the effect that the English were prevented
from purchasing land in the islands because they could
not otter the natives firearms in exchange. 1 instituted
inquiries, and embodied the result in a confidential memo,
to the Home Government. 1 cannot let you have the
memo., but will give you the figures from it. 1 find that
during the past three years English subjects have pur-
chased the following areas of land in the New Hebrides
group 4600 acres for £40195. 2d.; 2300 acres for £l6lBs.
lOd.; 3500 acres for £57 10s. 4d.; £3200 acres for £3O ;
8000 acres for £45 ; or, in all, 21,600 acres. The average
cost of this laud, it may interest you to know, was only
2Jd. per acre. Cheap enough, and yet we are told that
British subjects cannot obtain land in the New Hebrides I”
And since then more land has been “ bought”
—5200, 2000, 7000, 6000, 4500, and 4500 acres
—29,200 acres for the magnificent sum of £199
16s. ; in all, the huge sum of £254 4s. 4d. has
been invested in this trifling acreage of land,
and, therefore, it is only meet and just that the
public-spirited men who bought it (and pre-
sumably paid for it in trade goods at
Island prices) should be permitted to import
niggers and lease the land to coffee-planters
from Ceylon and elsewhere. For three years
past, on every possible occasion, someone in the
Commons has got up and said that the
British trader is being crushed in the New
Hebrides, and the colonies “ ain’t a-goiug to
stand it.” And, by a curious coincidence, this
disinterested M.P. will read an account of a
public meeting held in Sydney to protest against
the cruel, cruel restrictions upon British sub-
jects, and he generally adds that “ public feel-
ing is very strong in the colonies.” So it is.
Because, even though these greedy land syndi-
cates, calling themselves “Island traders,” have
the ear and support of the Sydney daily pressand
the stout persons that infest the Exchange, the
outside public know all about the matter and
won’t put any money in it, even though the
suffering British traders have attention called
to them by means of a “ Cook’s Excursion to
these Lovely Islands I” And when the Cooic’s
Excursion —which comprised two persons—
returns from the New Hebrides there will be
another public meeting gotten up for sympathy
with the mythical down-trodden British trader
who can’t buy any niggers, and as Hogan isn’t
now in England to barrack for them someone
else will get up in the Commons and proclaim
in a loud voice that a Cook’s Excursion has
been to the New Hebrides and seen that things
are very much worse for the British trader than
they were formerly, and all because he has no
nigger labor. And possibly people in England
will believe that there are a lot of British
traders in the New Hebrides ; and that Cook’s
Excursions to these cannibal islands are com-
mon, every-day affairs. But some people in Aus-
tralia know that there are just about as many
genuine traders, i.e., men earning their living
by trading, in the New Hebrides, as there
were Cook’s excursionists in the steamer that
went there the other day.
The cheerful Kanaka, who reminds Miss Shaw
of a humming-bird, is dying off on the
Northern sugar-plantations with his accustomed
want of consideration for the feelings of his
employer. The death-rate for 1893 (for grown-
up niggers, mark you), according to the
Registrar-General of Queensland, has been
62'57 per thousand. How does this compare
with 1254, the death-rate of the white popula-
tion (the “sick sparrow’ of Miss Shaw), in-
cluding womenfolk and children ? The in-
creasing death-rate, if bad for the employer
who loses the services of his humming-bird for
the unexpired balance of his term, is good
business for the Treasurer, who has already got
.£30,000 to the credit of “ deceased islanders’
estates account,” probably deposited with the
Queensland National Bank. The other day a
victim caught at Vera Cruz got away. As the
ship was approaching the hospitable shores of
Queensland, the ungrateful islander popped
overboard. The Q. newspapers mildly state
that “ no reason can be assigned for the act.”
It is very mysterious. Perhaps he was in haste
to meet his benevolent master and thought he
could swim faster than the ship ; also, perhaps,
he was actuated by the same motive that impels
a beast to break away from the mob when on
the way to the slaughter-house. Anyway, he
took his swag with him, so the Estates Fund
won’t make anything out of that child.
When a measure returns disfigured and dis-
torted to the Legislative Assembly, and some
Minister beseeches the House to take it with all
the Council’s bruises and twists upon it, or run
the risk of losing it altogether, common-
sense stands by the man who, for the sake of
the little good left in it, votes for the Bill. But
those who reject the measure and say they will
wait longer for a more perfect law have much
in their favour, for Parliamentary common-
sense tells these that if they allow a vitiated
measure to become law it will be alleged session
after session afterwards when repeal is
attempted that the law has not had a long
enough trial. The game of the Conciliation
Bill should be pasted in every legislator’s hat.
Dear Bulletin, —Let me make some remarks
on the more practical part of Mr. Drake’s
letter on Federation, viz., that dealing with
interprovincial Freetrade, I want to put it to
Mr. Drake that some measure of this breaking
of the border shackles could be undertaken
without any federal legislation. My scheme is
that every revision of the tariff in Australia
should take cognizance of all the other tariffs,
so that, bit by bit, they might tend to become
identical. And as soon as identity would be
attained in regard to any particular article, an
interprovincial mandate should be published :
“ The Customs tariff on the following article
will not be collected on this border till further-
notice.” Identity in some particulars has
already been reached. Queensland and New
South Wales tariffs, for instance, agree in the
following taxes :
Cement, per barrel .. ... u 2/-
Cocoa, per lb ... „ */4
Jams and Jellies, per lb. ... ... .. -/2
Sheet Lead, per ton .. .. .. ... 40/-
Paints (wet), per ton .. .. .. .. 60/-
Sparkling wines, per gallon 10/-
New South Wales and Victoria agree in some
items. For instance :
Manufactured tobacco .. .. 3/- per lb.
Unmanufactured 1/- per lb.
South Australia and Victoria may be quoted as
agreeing thus :
Coffee -/8 per lb.
Engines .. .. .. .. .. 25 per cent.
What is there to prevent Freetrade between
one province and another in all articles having
an identical tariff ? Of course there are many
items which approximate very closely :
Vic. N.S.W. Q’land.
Spirits per gallon ... 15/- 14/- 14/-
Perfumes per gallon .. 24/- 29/- 20/-
Molasses per lb. .. 3/- 3/4
Why could not these be adjusted at the earliest
opportunity and a further measure of inter-
provincial freetrade obtained ? There will
necessarily be difficulties with many items, but
the sooner the difficulties are attacked, the
easier will it be for the Federal Government
when it comes. The point about the scheme is
that just as it was sufficient for a ministerial
mandate to squelch the Vic. 10 per cent, drag-
net duties, so it would be sufficient for the
Ministers to say, “Such and such duties
must not be collected on this border.”
Federation, after all, is the sacrifice of many
minor advantages for many superior ones, and
the gradual extinction of border tariffs would
probably pique a large number of short-sighted
persons. But over all obstacles the march to
unity must press on. Victoria and South Aus-
tralia have taken the accursed thing, the stock-
tax, to. their bosoms. Vested interests have
got the stock-tax in their octopean tentacles,
and the unfortunate provinces hug both tax and
devil-fish. The difficulties are many, and will
have to be overcome bit by bit. Does it not,
therefore, seem that there is more hope in a
gradual assimilation of the tariffs than in an
effort to unify the tariff's at a blow ?— Fluffy.

In Essex the agricultural population is vanish-
ing so fast that, by the end of ’94, the writer
calculates, the rural districts will have success-
fu-lly got back to the condition of 500 years
ago. One farm which, in 1873, brought in
.£7OO a year rent and yielded the tenant a
living even at that price, is now let for 20s.
per annum. Many other farms are let at
nothing per annum, and a vast number more
are not let at all, simply because they won’t
pay rates and taxes. If the tithe—the tax
which is levied to maintain the glorious Estab-
lished Church—were abolished, and the farms
let rent free, the agriculturists might crowd
through ;as it is they can’t. Even the rural
landowner can’t live under present conditions.
One property which is instanced, was bought
cheap in ’75 for .£BOOO, and in ’B5 it was sold again
for .£420. It has since deteriorated considerably,
and would, perhaps, fetch £lOO. Another bloated
estate was purchased a few years ago for
£200,000, and the owner now receives a net re-
venue of £lOOO a year, equal to ten shillings per
cent, on his investment. Nearly half the agricul-
tural land of the country is absolutely deserted,
and can’t find tenants who will take the re-
sponsibility of paying taxes and tithes alone.
Out of all this arises two solemn questions
which the British Freetrader will soon have to
answer : (I) If Freetrade brings down the price
of imported food, grown in richer soils and
better climates, so low that the local agricul-
turist can’t make a living, which it has done,
isn’t the blessing rather overdone ? (2) If
Freetrade brings down the price of imported
manufactures, the produce of the cheapest kind
of pauper labour, so low that the local artisan
can’t live, which it is fast doing, then who will
be left to enjoy the advantages of Freetrade ?
Seemingly nobody.
The Bulletin has clipped it from Ambrose
Bierce, and has pasted it in its hat “against”
the nauseous Colonelbellisms of next 24th May
and Fourth of July :
It is interesting to note that an English warship’s
officers have been entertained in Boston simultaneously,
or nearly so, with the entertainment of an American war-
ship’s officers in London. On both “occasions” there
was an unbroken flow of the customary hoary platitudes
about blood being “thicker than water,” “the two great
divisions of the English race,” “a common language and
a common literature”—and the rest of it. This of a
people which has not 20 per cent, of English blood in
ins veins—a people that is no more a division of the
English race than it is of the Irish race—a people
which, although its dominant language is a bastard Eng-
lish, speaks all the tongues of the world as they are
spoken by peasants and paupers—a people whose political
majorities have no “ literature ” at all, and whose indus-
trial policy is dictated by savages unable to read even in
the languages of the countries whence they came ! This
fortuitous conglomeration of undigested and indigestible
“elements”; this mass of sodden human dough com-
pounded of all-sorts of tailings from the world’s mills, and
unyeasted with so much as an inspiration to rise evenly;
this unassorted and unsifted general rubbish dump-carted
upon what was once a sufferable vacant lot—this is “ the
American people !”—a “ division of the English race I”
We go far when we call it a division of the human race.
A little while back, in a Victorian city, two
or three of the local med icos, at a meeting of an
alleged “ Patriotic Association,” spoke upon
the righteousness of perfect freedom of con-
tract. “If,” said one, “a man is willing to
work for half the wage which a trades-union
considers he should have, that is purely a
matter for himself to consider. We must not
interfere with the liberty of the subject,
and he who works for little should be
equally respected with him who demands
much,” Since then a dead-beat doctor has
appeared upon the scene and worked up a
large practice by charging ss. per visit, with
physic thrown in, as against half-a-guinea, with
physic barred, levied by his brother medicos.
But is the cheap laborer equally respected with
him who demands much ? Not much ! Every
other doctor in the place spurns the medical
sweater as if he were a Canadian herbalist.
There are trades-unions and trades-unions and
“freedom of contract” should, of course, only
come in where “ professional etiquette ” —in
many cases only the snobbery of robbery—is not
involved.

Mr Dear Moorabinda—
The Violet Dance in aid of the Elizabeth-st.
Maternity Home took place in Paddington Town
Hall, on 30th ult., in the presence of Gov, and
Lady Duff and suite and a large congregation—a
little too large, in fact. In the simple annals of a
charity dance at a few shillings’ admission it is not
considered the best form, when vice-regality is
present, to sell tickets at the door with the same
indiscriminativeness displayed by the promoters
of a half-crown football reunion, for by so doing
you mix your social elements unwisely. The
maiden with the fuzzy-wuzzy coiffure and her
oily-haired partner don’t want to spend their
evening being shoo’d out of the vice-regal lancers,
neither do denizens of the dais like to bump up
against weird people who don’t seem to know the
rules of the social road; but, at the Violet dance,
both these miseries happened. I saw His Ex.
(with a pink native boronia blossom in his coat—
bush boutonnieres will probably become the
spring caper) taking himself down to supper and
absolutely cannoning off the people as he went—
the people bouncing off the Gov. in their turn in
the most unconscious manner possible. By the
way, Gov. Duff’s usual habit of going down to
supper alone will make him wildly unpopular with
suburban mayoresses and people like that, who
only interest themselves in local charities in the
hope of being hauled into supper on the arm of
the Governor.
The vice-regal party was escorted to the
inaptly-named Violet dance (just imagine any-
body choosing the modest and shrinking flower as
an emblem for a maternity dance ! They will be
calling the Benevolent Asylum “ Lily of the
Valley Lodge” next) by the “Dumpling,” and
the new private secretary, Mr. Pennyman. I
have called Mr. Pennyman bank-clerkish, but, on
nearer view, I recall the dreadful aspersion in toto.
Observed without intervening obstacles, Mr. P.
looks like a decided addition to Guvmeutouse
circles. He is about seven feet high, with what
might be called “improved Wallingtonian ”
features and a naval shave. He is the sort of
man—in a word—who looks lovely without epau-
lettes, or perhaps I only think so from having
seen him amateur-act a larky lieutenant so well.
Talking about vice regality reminds me that I
never told you of a degage spectacle I witnessed,
at a big recent ball, when something happened to
the garments of one of the vice-regal daughters
and pinning-up became necessary. The vision of
a very high official’s charming wife fixing up the
furbelows while a consul-general ran away for
pins, and came back carefully carrying them in
his crush-hat, was like a French comedj'—the
unstudied squeaks of the damsel in distress, as the
pins stuck into her, adding to the ensemble.
When ordinary people spring a leak they usually
retire selfishly to the cloak-room, holding on their
clothing with both hands as they go, but vice-
regality makes a piquant side-show of a little
accident like that,
A certain fresh unconventionality of demeanour
seems to be the trade-mark of the present tenants
of Government House. At the opening of Parlia-
ment, the other Tuesday, for example, when our
senators were running loose in full evening dress
and it looked as if whole barnyards had been
denuded of their steering-gear in order to trim
the hats of officialdom, a little undressed sort of
incident occurred that quite neutralised the moral
effect of all the pomp and circumstance. When
the small and unpretentious brougham containing
her Ex. and party drew up with a scrunch of the
Legislative gravel it was observed that Miss Kate
Duff had driven to the formal and frilly cere-
monies airily sitting on her brother’s knee !
Society in a certain Australian city has had bad
luck lately in the he-strangers it has taken un-
questioned to its palpitating bosom, and that
struck-by-lightning feeling which the society-girl
experiences when she finds herself buying gloves
in the autumn from the young man she flirted
with up the mountains in the summer is a very
general sensation just now. Two nice young men
from ’Ome have been exploiting society, repre.
Hunting themselves aa something very toney from
Pall Mall, getting their names into society
columns and generally doing the butterfly act for
several weeks.
But, as Katisha says, retribution, like a poised
hawk, was hovering over these wrong-doers, and
it has now leaked out {fortunately before any
society maidens have become irrevocably en-
tangled) that the mysterious pair, who might have
been dukes incog, for the grip they got on the local
nobility, are “simply a couple of masquerading
tradesmen!” Sal-volatile and burnt feathers are
at a premium in several fashionable quarters, for
“sassiety ” hates a tradesman as dearly as it loves
a lord. Which is one of the prettiest points in its
composition, I think. It’s so wide-minded as not
to be prejudiced by family connections.
Which reminds yours ever that you often hea r
people say slightingly, shrugging their shoulder 8
over the fashionable Mrs. Nouveau Riche, “ Oh —
she was a cook !” But that oughtn’t to be the
end of the chapter, if detraction is intended. The
awful point about it really is that she was such a
(blank space) bad cook before she soared above her
griddle.
A feature of the production of “ Morocco
Bound,” at Sydney Lyceum, was that Elton and
the new funny man, Wilfred Shine, both got
floral tributes—a horse-collar of laurel going up to
Elton, and reminding one of the (property) laurel
wreath that used to get hooked on to Vernon by
mistake in “ Nitouche.” Eor a first appearance
Miss Nannie Harding scored a very good florist’s
display. The newcomer has a pretty stage
presence, and wore a blush-colored silk frock in
act 1, and a trickily-tilted lace hat with nodding
roses on it, that made her look like Summer’s
advance-agent. The most captious person must
admit that Miss Nannie does full justice to the
situation sartorially, and the contrast of her pink
frock against Mr. Bathurst’s pale-grey morning
suit was quite sunsetty.
Great circle interest was claimed by the M.B.
show because of the appearance of three well-
known ex-amateurs in the bill. An amateur-
acting society youth billed as Mr. Bathurst came
forth as “Vivian,’’ and was physically large
enough, at least, to fill Brownlow’s boots; and
Miss Lulu Roberts made her debut as “Eva
Sketchley,” in a very stupid get-up. One would
imagine that a girl taking her first plunge into the
theatrical sea would gather a few properties round
herself in self-defence, so that her hands wouldn’t
seem to be obscuring the firmament. Making
believe to be an artist, Miss Lulu might have
hidden her nervousness convincingly behind a big
sketch-book, instead of desperately hanging on to
her bangle for support.
Neither did Miss Bessie Tarrant present a good
equipment as a society journalist. A 6x 4 note-
book and an inquisitive expression are the in-
variable adjuncts of a lady journalist on duty, but
Miss T. came on empty-handed. She was only a
nice girl in a fashionable frock, and lacked realistic
point in consequence. But the property man
wool-gathered from first to last. “ What ho ! the
flowing bowl! ” said the Grand Vizier, in
colored satin ; but no bowl made its appearance,
and the drinking-song went without a clink.
By the way, could anything have been more
embarrassing to the feelings of at least one of the
seceded amateurs than Miss Courtenay’s clever
burlesque of the floppy society skirt dance? I
liked Miss Courtenay. She wasn’t too smart in
her clothing, but she attracted you. Only she
shouldn’t pin the words of her songs on to the
blind side of her fan, and then forget and turn the
weapon hind side afore.
Those two inimitable artistes, Madame Camilla
Urso and Madame de Vere Sapio, who end their
artistically-triumphant season at Sydney Cen-
tenary Hall to-night (Saturday), cannot be
regarded conscientiously as an unmixed blessing
to us Australians. In a land to which such high-
priestesses of real music pay only angel’s visits, it
is to be questioned whether it isn’t better to keep
on in happy ignorance thinking that the squeak-
ingß and squawkings of average local talent are
delightful hearing, and saying “ Oh !” rapturously
as Monsieur Rosina skips tight places in the
snuffy sonata. You know 1 never did believe in
inissionarying of any sort. The genius who shows
you how Ithe thing really ought to be done and
then goes away and leaves you to your own doom
is almost as bad as the evangelist who travels
thousands of miles to tell the happy and ignorant
savage all about Beelzebub.
People have often wondered why Governor Duff
didn’t extend his patronage to the Urso conceits,
but the reason is simple enough—his Excellency
wasn’t asked. The management do not indis-
criminately approve of Governors as a settled
principle, ever since Tasmania’s own Gormanston
attended a concert and snored audibly all through
the show. So now Governors attend or not just
as the refinement of their musical taste dictates.
This is the month of the two muoh-talked-of
charity balls—the Boys’ Brigade on the 12th
instant, and the Hospitals’ Ball, to supplement
Hospital Saturday collections, on the 19th. Both
will come off in Sydney Town Hall—both
have very strong committees, and people who
haven’t bought tickets for one or other of them
are a rarity. I hope both will have the best
of good fortune, as the Boys’ Brigade is as deserv-
ing a cause as the Hospitals, and vice-versa.
Folks who look at the world through variously-
filled glasses have queer experiences. There was
a Sydney musician, for example, who got hilarious
at a friend’s house and demanded a “ ’amsan-
wich ”at 12 p.m. There was no preserved pig in
the place, as it happened, but the musician was
hungry and a ’amsanwich had to be built. So
neatly-cut slices of bread well-buttered, with a
dressing of Worcester sauce and a layer of nice,
pink blotting-paper between them, were served in
sandwich-shape to ze great artiste, who ate them
unquestioningly—and grew sober almost on the
instant! N.B.—Echo Farm authorities have full
permission to copy this into their recipe-books.
Brisbane shuffles Governors shortly (I say Bris-
bane advisedly, because the Cooktown end of
Kanakaland doesn’t see much of the vice-regal
side-show, I’ll bet 16 bananas in a bag), his
Northern Excellency having announced his firm
though sorrowful intention of getting away bag-
and-baggage the moment he can do so with
official decorum. His “increasing years ” are his
reasons for not agreeing to an extension of his
term of office—a prior engagement with old Father
Time, as it were—and it really is a good advt. f or
Northern aplomb that General Norman should
ever have been asked to linger longer beside the
erratic Brisbane River. Considering that His
Ex. refused the Viceroyship of India on the
ground of having seen out too many birthdays for
that sort of thing, and feeling a wish for his own
armchair and slippers, it was pretty cool, to say
the least of it, to imagine that the chance to do
another stretch of hard society labour in Banana-
land would be received with grateful thanks by
the principal victim. 3
But Governors have only themselves to blame
for these weird, though well-meant, invitations—it
is really the fault of their stolid and Spartan-like
determination to make the best of things and
assume a studiously-lively expression as if opening
flower-shows were the very diamond ridge of their
ambition. You can always spot the potentates
who will be begged to keep a firm grip on their
various sceptres. They are the men whose
amiable but ghastly grin goes on for ever—a fixed
and horrid smile which looks as if the wearer hung
it up on a nail overnight, and put it on with Ids
necktie in the morning. The only Governor who
gets away gracefully is the Governor who hasn’t
tried to look all through his term of office as if h e
longed to call the local Premier his uncle. Gov.
Duff, for instance, need he under no annoying
apprehensions that he will be asked to alter the
date of his return ticket.
Governor Norman will be much missed in
tropical society of all shades, and there is an
official at Brisbane Parliament House who will
feel like weiiring crape when his Ex. packs his
Gladstone with an irrevocable air. He is an
ancient warrior of the Indian army whenever lost
a chance in his life of waylaying Sir Henry (who
had officer’d him in the long ago), and blowing
the trumpet of his particular “thin red-line of
’eroes,” and how they fought like little bull-dogs
in a particular battle. His Ex. stood this as long
as possible, but one day the worm turned. “My
good fellow,” he said, “you seem to quite forget
that we were all fighting for our lives.”
I have received from the composer “ Bert
Lawson ” a copy of his Rosalind Waltz, dedicated
very aptly to Hilda Spong, a nice portrait of
whom in doublet and hose (only the picture doesn’t
show any of the hose) literally adorns the cover.
The waltz is something like the picture—a little
unfinished, judged as a harmonious whole, but
the beat is well sustained throughout, and people
who couldn’t dance to it couldn’t dance to any-
thing. Society heard the Rosalind Waltz on the
orchestra at Hilda Spong’s benefit, and it has
since been played at Govt. House.
There are two superstitions extant regarding the
after-penalty of rescuing drowning people, and they
are that if a man saves a man from drowning he
is sure to incur his hatred, and if he saves a
woman it’s a hundred to one she marries him.
The romantic scene which took place at the dis-
tribution (by Lady Duff) of the National Ship-
wreck Relief Society’s medals, the other day at
Sydney, gives color to the assertion. The spec-
tacle of a young lady publicly thanking the brave
man who had rescued her from the sea, and stick-
ing a gold pin in his tie and a bunch of forget-me-
nots in his coat-collar, is enough to make any care-
ful bachelor pause before hauling a damp and
drowning maiden out on to terra-cotta by her
back hair. Mind you, it was absolutely the right
thing for the lady to do, but there are few
women who, however grateful, would have been
plucky enough to face the ordeal.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITE.

“Morocco Bound” opened under good
auspices at Sydney Lyceum. Its reputation as a
London success caused an unparalleled rush for
seats, and the audience was in an enthusiastic
mood and prepared to whoop on the smallest
provocation. But the provocation was not forth-
coming to the extent expected. The English
success of “Morocco Bound,” which was un-
doubtedly great, is another of these mysteries whicli
the mere “kawlonial” can’t understand. The
best that can be said for it is that the first act is
very good and contains much promise, and the
second contains very little performance. It leaves
a vague impression that the talented author died
after writing Act I., and that, amid the grief and
confusion caused by his decease, an eccentric rela-
tive got in unnoticed at the window and secretly
wrote Act II., and then escaped unobserved. The
first half of the opera is devoted to the schemes of
an Irish Bey to civilise Morocco by introducing
the blessings of the British variety-show, and
then, just as something seems to be about to begin
to happen, the Bey gets back to Morocco, and
gives his variety-show before a serious brown
vizier. It is a sufficiently good show of its kind,
and those who like this kind of varietv-show will
doubtless be satisfied. But it is a taine and flat
ending to a piece which foreshadowed better
things.
* • «
Leaving out the innate cussedness of Act
II., there are many good points about the pro-
duction. Gordon’s scenery is excellent, and the
reality of the water-scene is guaranteed by the
presence of two swans and some other waterfowl,
which have a brief but exciting fight as a proof of
their bona fides , and by the fact that Josiah
Higgins’ bulldog takes a drink out of it, and
returns with the genuine beverage dripping from
his nose. The music is bright and tuneful all
through, and the chorus works smoothly, and
half-a-dozen of the songs should be favorably
remembered. That old-time favorite, “Billy”
Elton, has returned in as wild spirits as of
old, and some of his dances are reminiscent of
the days when he first did the incantation scene
in the “Sorcerer.” Wilfred Shine is an able
comedian of the Quietly impressive order, and
gives complete satisfaction. Messrs. Gribben and
Sceats are both acceptable, and F. Stayton is a
truly beautiful idiot, who would be still better if
he had more room for development. But most of

fi,a ladies, even the beauteous Miss Nannie
Harding, fell flat on Saturday, with various
degrees of flatness, and, though a partial ex-
Ption is hereby made in favor of Miss
Edna Grace, the only real enduring joy
among them all is a bright and humorous
skirt dance by Miss Courtenay, which is ap-
rently intended to be naughty, but doesn’t quite
Lt there. Still, it nearly gets there. Various
ther dances seem intended for a similar
mirpose; but the high kick leaves off too
Lon. Also, the lovely and curly-headed
male artist of the co. doesn’t leave off
nearly soon enough. But the painfully Hinglish
infulness of Act 11. is a bad feature. Since last
Saturday it has been altered and much improved,
but one of the principal drawbacks is that the
production is apparently intended for a hilarious
parody on something which the Australian com-
munity doesn’t know and, therefore, fails to
understand. Possibly the imported Briton in
0 ,,r midst will understand it, but to the coarse
and common native it is incomprehensible.

“ Charley’s Aunt ” has come back to
Sydney Criterion, and opened on Saturday to all
the business which that house could hold. On her
previous visit she ran for six weeks, and, when she
left off, was still going as strong as ever. On the
present occasion the dissipated female only pro-
poses to remain for a fortnight, though her
welcome looks as if it would last much
longer. There are no new features in the
comedy, but all the old features are as
good as ever. The aunt, in a burst of indignation,
proceeds to undress herself on the stage, and
bounds out of her skirt and petticoat with the
same grace and lightness as of yore ; also, she
dresses herself in public in the gently-unobtrusiye
fashion which took so well on her previous visit.
When she sprints across the stage with her pants
ami her large boots showing conspicuously under-
neath her robes, and her drinky lover pursues her
and tries to punctuate his tale of affection with his
decayed umbrella, the enthusiasm is as high as it
ever was, and the aunt’s reflections on the dis-
sipated and devilish nature of women are as much
to the point as they used to be, woman not
having improved lately to any great extent. The
comedy consists so entirely of Frank Thornton
that a noticeable all-round improvement-in the
company doesn’t really matter much ; still, it may
be mentioned that the co. has improved a good
deal. It plays more evenly than it did,
and that little personage, Miss Dot Frederics,
looks even brighter and prettier than when she
was last heard from. A week of the “Private
Secretary” is promised later on, and then the
boneless amanuensis departs for England, never—
at least, so it is rumoured —to return *-o this
beastly country.

Next Monday “ Henry V.” is to be revived
at Her Majesty’s, Sydney, Mr. Rignold having
decided that a vast historical pageant is just the
thing which the occasion requires. Most of the
English history which the gods are acquainted
with is acquired by seeing Mr. Rignold on his big
white horse, storming foreign cities and beheading
traitors at Her Majesty’s. Therefore, if the
revival is not under the patronage of the local
Education Department, it will be another evidence
that Garrard, M.L. A., is utterly unfitted for his
billet.

The Hallewell Glee Club tried to give
another of its excellent concerts on Saturday night
at Sydney Y.M.C.A. Hall, but the fire which was
raging almost next door, and the yells of several
thousand barraokers, broke the show to pieces.
The performance therefore stands postponed till
this (Saturday) evening, and the Club is thinking
of putting in a claim for fire damages on the insur-

Annie Besant started her Australian tour
at Melbourne Bijou before an audience which
coughed not nor shifted in its seat for 80 minutes.
Her subject was “The Dangers that threaten
Society,” and she must have satisfied every reason-
ing person present that these dangers radiate
mostly from the Almighty dollar, and are aggra-
vated by the church doctrine that everybody is a
miserable beast. The Bijou audience seemed
surprised to learn that man is by spiritual
nature divine, but when this truth had been
lucidly explained there was a burst of gratified
applause. Only the parsons in the stalls ap-
peared hurt by the statement. Mrs. Besant
is now an almost white-haired woman with
a troubled face. Her white - gowned figure
suggests an absence of corset, and she makes no
attempt at theatrical effect. It is what she says
that holds her audience, rather than the earnest
way in which she says io. She discourses in a
musical monotone, broken now and then by an
anecdote, but her anecdotes are few. She never
■ pauses for a word, and she talks straight along to
her logical conclusion. The fault of Mrs. Besant’s
eloquence is the evenness of its flow. She is con-
vincing, but not terse. She does not give the
attention of the audience a moment’s rest, and, as
she seldom stops to take a round of applause, the
mental strain upon her devoted hearers is unneces-
sarily severe. In short, Mrs. Besant is all that
the impostor Talmage was not. She is Smythe’s
act of reparation for having inflicted that cheap
Yankee joker upon a confiding public, and her
fame will grow in the land. On Wednesday
evening Mrs. Besant was to deliver the first of her
Theosophical addresses, which, judging from the
soundness of her opening lecture, will not be so
ghostly as anticipated.

Pinero’s “Cabinet Minister,' a farce
tvhioh caught the author in an unhappy moment,
is doing a brief sentence at Melb. Princess’s. A
week, at the most, will suffice for the rise and fall
of this feeble riot: Then it will be blotted out of
memory like Patterson’s Budget. The Minister
has no policy to put before the country, nor is he
full of cheerfulness and confidence. The notice-
able features about him are his impecunious wife
and a number of noble connections and friends.
Outside of this wandering host are a garish
Jewish extortioner and his sister in compound
interest, who pursue the Minister’s wife with
blue promissory notes, and ultimately harass her
into finding salvation at the stock-exchange. Hav-
ing effected a grand and splendidly-immoral coup,
thelady commands her Hebrew horse-leech to totter
off, after which the remaining sixteen characters
perform a Caledonian reel, or some equally heathen
rite. Mrs. Brough, as the Minister’s wife, wears
a Court costume valued at thirty-five guineas.
She is also fitted with a part that shows her off to
advantage in her lightest mood. Mr. Brough
wears a kilt, falling well below the knee, whilst
Boucicault sports a similar confection in the last
act. The Jewish accent of the last-named artist
leaves much to be desired, but Miss Noble plays
marbles prettily, and the other members of the
cast help to fill the bill. Miss Ethel Haydon
deserves special mention on account of her alleged
baby, for it is evident to all beholders that Miss
Haydon has nob yet brought herself to think
seriously about anything of the kind. The
damsel’s smile when she discusses her stage-infant
is the most natural item of the performance. On
Saturday, “ Lady Windermere’s Fan.”

Five nights of “ The Sunny South ” are
bringing the present season at Melb. Royal to a
prosperous finish. Custom doesn’t stale the wild
excitement of Darrell’s early narrative, and
although George has utilised the “Sunny South ”
characters for a dozen subsequent dramas they
always return to this particular work with the air
of honest penitents coming back to their first
loves. Matt Morley is the lawful owner of
George’s felt hat, coloured flannel shirts and top
boots. Many other Darrellian heroes have bor-
rowed those picturesque habiliments, but Matt is
the man they were made for. Moreover, he is the
original exponent of George’s legs and deadly
calm, which, by the way, is a good deal calmer
than of yore. Some time ago an irreverent young
man named Hawthorne took to giving an imita-
tion of George Darrell in his most famous speech.
The mimic’s rendering of “Fire, and be darn’d to
you !” was reckoned a complete success. George’s
voice is less foggy than formerly, and on Saturday
he gave the order for his own assassination in the
tone of one muttering in his sleep. The imitation
is now merely a relic of the lurid past,
** * *
On Friday the Royal will be devoted to a
deserving benefit for Miss Maud Williamson, an
actress who seldom gets a chance to display her-
self at her best. On Saturday, anew season is to
be opened by the Taylor-Carrington Cos., in a
drama called “Never Despair.”
** * *
The Alexandra show, on Saturday, was
“Oast Adrift,” a close copy of “Alone in
London.” The five leading characters of the old
drama are reproduced in “Cast Adrift,” the only
decided difference between the two plots being a
matter of murderous detail. Miss Dora Mostyn
takes the lead as a tattered shoe-black, with songs,
and the agony is well sustained in other places.
Perhaps an exception can be ma'de in disfavour of
a Mr. Young, brother of Miss Florence, whose
humour requires boiling down and careful strain-
ing. Dan Barry’s company are about to cease
operations at the Alexandra, it seems. Daniel is
getting ready for another country tour, and any-
one who wants to lease the theatre from Sept.
15th can enjoy that privilege on reasonable terms.

Cyril Tyler, the boy soprano recently im-
ported by the Adelaide syndicate that ran
Sterling and Belle Cole, has sent Adelaide mad.
He is 16 years old and has an intelligent face, and
without obtrusive precocity sings difficult pieces
like Gounod’s “ Ave Maria” with ease. Perhaps
his most effective piece is the Carnival de Venise
as arranged by Julius Benedict for Patti; but
when this mere youngster sang as an encore, on
the first evening, “Home Sweet Home’’ he
established himself on a rock-foundation with his
audience. Fair terms granted, the boy should
crush a big dividend for the syndicate.
** * *
Cyril Tyler is announced to give seven
concerts at Melbourne Athenaeum, supported
by three adult performers and little Miss
Jessie Spring, an 11-year-old pianist from Sydney.
Concerning the vocal ability of young Tyler
there seems to be no doubt whatever. He has,
moreover, a very interesting young personality,
and it is a pity that he will not be seen in con-
junction with the other clever boy, Percy
Grainger, in his pianoforte recital.
** * *
Talmage, the Brooklyn windmill, didn’t
set Adelaide ablaze. At his first and second lec-
tures the Y.M.C.A. Hall was only three-parts
filled, also there was no crowd yelling outside,
and the three policemen were not required to pilot
the doctor to the main entrance. Besides, some
interfering person had previously pointed out
that there was a back entrance, and the advt. of a
perspiring parson pushing through the multitude
which wasn’t there was therefore unnecessary.
Talmage was really “licked by a mere kid.”
Cyril Tyler, the boy soprano, opened his season
on the same evening, and had crowded houses,
whilst the ’Murkan with the mouth was talking to
a few hundreds.

Miss Orelli, who has been doing so well in
amateur opera shows, is to appear shortly at a
Melbourne Met. Liedertafel concert, where she
will probably sing a charming composition by
Zelman—a little thing that he wrote for one of
the local R.C. churches. Few people know that
Zelman, the ancient conductor of the Flemington
lawn-band, is a clever composer. They think of
him as one who wags a baton whilst his followers
blow “Two Little Girls in Blue,” &c., from brass
instruments. It will be a surprise for most con-
cert-goers to hear Miss Orelli bring out the
strength of Zelman’s music with her rich young
voice. But why, O! why, is the damsel’s real
name Orelli ? The world will never believe that
her father didn’t come from Ireland.

Melbournites don’t understand “The Bauble Shop,” B.
and B.’s latest, at the Princess’. Lord Clivebrook, the
House of Commons leader in the play, has no parallel in
their minds with J. Beefy Patterson. Also, the Parlia-
mentary scenes fall flat. The audience only wakes up
when the hooting in the House is heard “off.” It
recognises the sound at once, and shows its first spasm of
interest. It has heard it before at football matches. The
other evening, three curtains went down without a hand.
One man in the stalls prominently unfolded a Police
Gazette and read it through the remainder of one act and
an interval.

of a sandwich-man is about the lowest on earth. The
man who appears publicly as a sandwich abandons all
social hope. Anyhow, that is the public notion, and
public opinion is the lord and master of all things. A

Apropos of stage speechifying by Madame Simonsen,
Bendigo swelldom never patronised any of her companies
because of a roasting speech she once made concerning
their musical tastes, as contrasted with those of the
Cousinjack miners. On the occasion of her speech one
man only occupied the dress-circle, and Madame noted
that even he had gone out and forgotten to return. A
packed house, bar the circle, always after that greeted
her.
H.: “ Miss Ethel Haydon goes to London with a horse-
shoe, to commence with an enviable small position in
Irving’s company. She will be a pleasing little actress
and singer on an average plane. Every musical girl in
Melbourne is supposed to be a Melba, only awaiting
diamond-cutting. Look at Amy Sherwin and Alice Rees,
both with grand natural voices, but not of the quality of
inspiration to enable them to become Melbas. Which of
the present aspirants imagines herself to be even a Rees
or Sherwin ? We are beginning to receive the returned
empties. It requires to be impressed on fond parents,
and benevolent subscribing entrepreneurs, that the divine
gift must be waited for.”

Fillis’s elephants bolted last week, in Melb., while draw-

The elephants were stopped in a mad race down the foot-

A London woman’s paper is responsible for the state-
ment that an American impresario has made an offer of
£lOO a week to Lord Shaftesbury to tour as a singer

have been used in assisting Moody and Sankey’s choir.
After all, when “Madame Sans-Gfine ” is produced at

A Melb. paper safs that, in “The Bauble Shop,” Jones,

Asa matter of fact, he is a Radical and aNoncomformist,

His father, Sylvanus Jones, is a cattle-dealer and a regular

devoured the turkey. Cautiously reconnoitring at the
rendezvous, I found it was a lady of 70, and made Grisi

I think very few people know how troublesome dramatic

Teddy Royce has gone back to London Gaiety to play in
a “ Little Jack Sheppard” revival, but the old favourite
doesn’t take his original part. Danby is the Blueskin,

Prank Gerald is playing in England, and the press talks

“Hans the Boatman,” it seems, is a plagiarism from
reality. Some years ago, at Teignmouth (Eng.), there
was a handsome, blue-eyed boatman named Thomas
Onion. A young lady visitor, with a fortune of £BOO a
year, fell in love with the elegant gondolier, and after a
brief course of dizzy mash they fled together and got
married, and the lady settled £4OO a year upon her poetic
Onion. The story ends there. Whether Onion continued
to be beautiful and poetic, or whether he degenerated
into a lout with a pipe and a pot of beer no one knows.
Also, there were no father and no big dog in the story,
which spoils it. Most of the poetry in “ Hans the Boat-
man ” consists of the big dog.
Jerome’s paper tells this more or less pathetic tale
about Yvette Guilbert, the vocal harridan who has lately
taken Paris and London by storm : “ One day Zola gave
a breakfast! to his publishers on a little island in the
Bois de Boulogne, and Yvette was there to amuse them.
She sat in her usual drooping fashion under the shadow
of one of the spring trees, and listened to Zola’s pitiful
account of his early struggles when he fought for bread
and recognition. As he waxed eloquent she leaned
forward, her elbows on her knees, her face in the
palms of her hands. When he had finished and called
upon her for a song, she rose and sang it with all the
abandon, the fling, the swing, the diabolical proficiency
of her craft; and as she stood and sang, the sun, with its
usual merciless irony, shone through the leaves full on
to the painted face, into the weary eyes, and sought out
the dye of her hair and the disorder of her gown.
Finally, it halted and rested on two great tear-drops on
her cheek, which had stood there since Zola's recital.”
Now that Romeo Greenaway is openly married, that
Melb. sassiety girl has the laugh on all her knowing

The net profits of the Melbourne Dramatic F6te

A Melbourne weekly paper adorned its first issue
with the statement that Melba is only 29 years of age.
Which would make her out to have the oldest-looking
younger sisters on record. Madame Nellie Mitchell Arm-
strong can’t be less than 34, anyway, and her latest por-
traits are libellous at that.
Histrion : “ A recent incident in an Australian theatre,
recals to my mind an American episode. Then an
actress refused to let the curtain go up till £5O was
counted into her lap. It was not such a large amount in
the case of the Australian actress. On such occasions the
poor performers groan, for obvious reasons.”
In its estimate of the duration of time the theatrical
profession is as various and contradictory as the Bible. A
few weeks ago it was cabled that Roland Macquarie (R.
Cunningham) had accepted a three years’ engagement
with Augustin Daly, of New York, and now it is flashed
that he is expecting an engagement with the Gaiety Co.
The same old story was told in connection with a score of
others—including almost every musical ambitionist who
has wandered Europe-wards; hut events have proved
that the years of their engagements are not the same
years by which we collect our income. This is not
intended to convey any other news than that of various
estimates of time.
Ellen Terry, unsatisfied with the triumphs she has
gained, is going to risk comparison with two foreign
actresses. Irving has purchased the English rights of
“La Lacondiera,”in which Eleonora Dus6 made such a
hit, and also of “ Madame Sans G6ne,” in which Rdjane
plays so brilliantly. Both pieces are to be translated, the
latter by Comyns Carr. Judicious friends regret this
decision of the fair Ellen, who has nothing to gain and
much to lose by comparison with the two actresses named.
Bland Holt would he a “ big attraction ” if he played
clown in one of the forthcoming pantomimes. His suc-
cesses as such in 'bygone pantos, have made his name

Dear Bulletin, —l was once in a tight place, but I got
out of it. When Maoriland was a greater stamping-
ground for amateurs than even now, I was an amateur. I
dropped a good billet, joined a travelling co., played up
the coast, and got stranded in Auckland. Then we, as a
forlorn hope, agreed to go up to Paeroa as a variety co.
I went up a week in advance, filled the paper with locals,
stuck hills on every tree for miles round, visited all the
mining camps and sawmills, and arranged for traps to
call at the camps and mills on the eventful night. I
stirred up immense enthusiasm by my lies about the
talent of thatco. and its successes before crowned heads
and such things. The Wednesday fixed for the
show was wet and stormy'. At five o’clock I went
down to meet the steamer on which the co. was to
arrive. They were not aboard. (It afterwards turned
out that they had got unanimously and paralytically
drunk in Auckland.) Already' the traps were filling the
township with miners and mill-hands, and a big house
was a certainty. It was a hole, but I faced the music.
At 8 o’clock I came before the curtain and told a £6O
house of rough miners and millers, many of whom had
come 10 miles through the rain, that my co. had not come
up. There was a terrific row. The language was pink,
and blue, and personal. I saw a sortie for the stage
beginning, yelled : “Money returned at the doors,” and
made a rush for “ behind.” In my haste I walked clean
through the drop-scene. I sprinted for the pub, locked my
door, got between the sheets, and snored vigorously. No
good. The audience followed me, broke in the door, and
hauled me, in my pyjamas, down to the bar. Then they
decided to duck me in the river. I was thrown in at the
end of a rope into the coldest water this earth ever
knew, and informed that I was going to stay' there till I
sang them a song. I sang “Nancy Lee ” clean through,
and those w’retches sang every chorus twice. They
hauled me out at last. Then some praised my' pluck in
singing so gamely'. I hadn’t really been plucky, but I
did want to get out of that water. Then, blest if they
didn’t make a hero of me, carry me shoulder-high to the
pub., strip me, dry me, and clothe me decently before
the bar fire. There was a terrific shivoo, and everyone,
including myself, was filled neck-high with whisky. I
got away safely next day', but I’ve never cared tackle
advance agency since.-—Yours, etc., X.Z.

the four quarters of his little skull. . . . It must be
clearly understood that there are men in the Labor move-
ment to-day who will stand no nonsense. They mean
business, and are prepared, if need be, to upset hell itself
rather than tamely submit to the arrogance and treachery
of poison-lipped office-seekers.
Just think of the pink-cheeked Mr. Holman

Tawhiao, the much-
tattooed king of the
Maoris, of whom an
admirable portrait by
King, of Sydney, is here
printed, has died an in-
glorious death of in-
fluenza. Tawhiao was a
grumpy old fellow, who
never did anything very
remarkable either before
or after his visit to
England, eight or nine
years ago, when he and
his retinue tried to inter-
view Queen Victoria re
native-land grievances,
but failed. The Colonial
Office refused to procure
an interview for the head
of perhaps the noblest of
all dark races, although
the Foreign Office allowed
a couple of niggers, who
arrived from Africa
about the same time with
a present of monkeys for
Her Gracious, to grovel
at her feet at Windsor
Castle. Poor Tawhiao
was quite out of his
element in London, and
when there had a rather
joyless time. The present
writer saw him enter a
Strand restaurant and
calmly pick up a roast
duck off a marble slab.
“How much?” enquired
his Majesty. “ Six shil-
lings,” replied the re-
staurateur. “Too much,”
said the king of the
Maoris. But then the
shopkeeper explained,
through a white atten-
dant of the dark poten-
tate, that his Majesty
having mauled the duck
with his hands would
have to pay for it. At
first Tawhiao seemed dis-
posed to dispute that the
pakeh a’s roast d uck would
be any the worse for the
touch, not to say squeeze,
of the royal hand, but ultimately he paid up, and
had the duck put into paper, after unceremoniously
wrenching off and eating a leg, and scooping out
some B uffing into his hand with the leg-bone.
When he arrived in London they provided lodg-
ings for him at a very swell boarding-house in
Russell Square. On the first evening of his resi-
dence there, tired out by tramping the streets all
day he went upstairs early to bed. Half-an-hour
later, and while he was being eagerly discussed by
the ladies below, his Majesty descended with a
candle in his hand and attired only in a day-shirt.
Walking right into the drawing-room he bluntly
said to the first lady he met—a very good-looking
Australian girl, by the way “ Gimme box
matches.” There was no style about poor old
King Tawhiao.

A country newspaper has discovered some
coincidences re N.S.W. Postmaster-General Cook.
He is a native of Hartley, Staffordshire, Eng.,
and represents Hartley, N.S. Wales, in Parlia-
ment ; also, Hartley is in the county of Cook
(N.S.W.)
According to Max O’Rell, “ Sir Henry
Parkes is the one venerable Australian institu-
tion, the only suggestion of the antique in a land
that possesses no antiquity.” Evidently Max
hasn’t heard of the gallows, and of Alfred
Stephen.
It is noticeable just now how many pro*
rainent Australian lawyers are voluntarily or com-
pulsorily shying off politics and office, and sticking
more or less severely to their own business—Brace
Smith, Barton, Wise, Deakin and Drake as a few
instances.
Mrs. Ellen O’Neill has died at Tumut,
N.S.W., aged 104 years. Theold lady had lived at
Tumut for 35 years, and belonged to a family
noted for longevity, her father having died at 100
years, a sister at 104, and a brother within a year
of the century.
Gov. Norman retires from official life at
the expiration of his present term in Queensland.
The blunt and unassuming old soldier is genuinely
popular, despite of, or perhaps because of, his
limited show of hospitality—mainly caused by
comparative poverty.
Brigg and Palairet, both of the coming
English Eleven, were recently married. Also,
both men made a three figure innings on the third
day of their respective honeymoons. Rather dif-
ferent, this, to the feeble displays of Murdoch in
his early career as a husband.
When Governor Robinson left for W.A.,
after his visit to Melbourne, Gov. Hopetoun,
according to the Age, “informally walked to the
station ”to see him off. It is a gladsome thing to
know that even such a potentate as Hopetoun does
walk informally now and then.
Wahanui, Premier to the lately-deceased
King Tawhiao, is an enormously broad, stout man,
who weighs 225 t., and can on occasion eat 61b. of
mutton at a meal. Wahanui’s brother, the Ngati-
maniapoto chief Kahu, was even bigger than his
brainier relative, and literally as strong as a horse.

Kingston :
Adelaide, August 20,1894.
Sir,—Your first letter was a transparent device to escape
from accepting my challenge. Your second was an
attempt to cover your retreat by offensive inuendo and
misrepresentation. Your last act in handing the corres-
pondence to the press without any previous intimation to
me and without awaiting a reply was so opposed to the
practice of gentlemen, and so characteristic of your usual
method of warfare, that I must decline to hold any further
private correspondence with you.—Your obedient ser-
vant,
John W. Downbr.
Hon. C. C. Kingston, Q.C.
August 20, 1894.,
Dear Sir John, —Pray accept the assurance of my
sorrow that to the failure of your memory already noted
there must now be added the loss of your temper. This
is all the more to be regretted, as in inducing your dis-
course on “ the practice of gentlemen ” it has provoked a
rash incursion on your part into regions with which,
judging from your letter, you have little practical
acquaintance.—Yours truly,
C. C. Kingston.
Sir John Downer. K.0.M.0.

Labor-member M‘Gregor told S.A. Coun-
cil the other night that rhetorician Ward’s elo-
quence reminded him of the “ beautiful vegetation
growing out of the carcase of a dead hog.” The
idea, in its eloquential and abstract sense, had
never struck The Bulletin, bub this paper has
often pondered long and deeply on that mar-
vellous alchemy of Nature which permits, and
even encourages, the fragrant rose to grow out of
the breast of the dead Chinaman.
Surely no poet ever passed through a more
frightful ordeal thandid Mr. Henry Heyly n Hayter,
Victorian Statist and bard, a few days ago ! Mr.
Hayter was called as a witness in the Speight v.
Syme case and had to stand in the box and hear
quotations from his own poems read by Purves,
Q.C., for the benefit of a courtroomful of soulless
cynics. For instance, this sort of thing, taken
from an aboriginal epic entitled “Oarbaona” :
The plaintive refrain of (he mopoke ;
The opossum’s sharp squeak as it signalled its mate on the
tree-top;
The din of the laughing-jackass.
Yet the poet Hayter had to listen to this and even
worse specimens of criminal assault committed by
him on the hexameter years ago.
Victorian Speaker Bent, addressing Premier
Patterson : “I would ask the hon. member not to
use such an expression as 1 barracked.’ ”
This seems a most stupendous joke,
And yet it’s true enough ;
And shows that even the rudest folk
May change their manners rough.
Who would have thought that knew him, some
Few years back, that a fop
In language Bent would e’er become—
A verbal Turveydrop?
But he is now a heavy swell,
And slang he has exiled ;
His speech it all comes from the well
Of English undefiled.
Then let the welkin for that bright
Phenomenon be rent—
The elegant, the high-polite.
The euphemistic Bent!
When the pompous and frigid Arthur
Gordon was Governor of Maoriland he was pro-
bably about the best-hated man in the province.
When any “common person” spoke to Gordon
without being first addressed by that dignitary
the consequences were dreadful. Once, on board a
Union boat, the captain so far forget himself as to
make an unauthorised remark to the great man
concerning the weather. Gordon looked at him
with an astounded expression for a moment, and
then turned to his aide-de-camp and said slowly,
“What does he say?” The same evening at
dinner the Guvnah thawed sufficiently to ask the
captain what time they would arrive. “ Steward,”
said the captain, pointing at his passenger with
a fork, “ What did he say ? ” Then the Governor
went on deck and probably told his aide that
these demned colonials needed to be suppressed by
British troops. _
The late Dr. Fisher, of Collins-street,
Melb,, left one of the finest collections of pictures
(a 40 years’ gathering) in the Australias. It is
almost entirely representative of the early English
school. Hogarth, Reynolds, Laurence, Turner,
Gainsborough, Bonnington, S. Prout, David Cox
and David Roberts are examples. It contains the
only Constable in Australasia. The pictures will,
in a few weeks, come before the public thro’ sale
and art-union—the late doctor’s widow being com-
pelled to part with them. Dr. Fisher arrived in
Australia in ’52. After six months’ work on the
diggings he began practice in Melb. —in the days
when doctors went about their professional duties
in dross-coats—and there he laboured until his
death in March last. He was the special lover of
the artist, and did a good deal to keep Australian
art alive. Charles Summers, the sculptor, was
one of his most intimate friends.
Ono of the chief reasons for appointing
Commander Archibald T. Carter to the charge of
the flagship Orlando in Australian waters is that
he is another hero of the great Soudan campaign.
The Admiralty will never realise that that has
ceased to be a qualification for anything to the
bulk of Australians.
Somebody is urging the appointment, for
trade reasons, of a Chinese representative at
Sydney, and recommends Quong Tart for the
position. Quong Tart won’t do. When Aus-
tralia gets a Chinese Minister, he must have a
shiny moon-face and a pigtail; also, he must have
horn spectacles and a large stomach.
Auckland (M.L.)has
a serious coroner—not a
festive person like Ghoul,
of Melbourne —who al-
ways endeavours to ex-
tract a moral from the
corpse, and improves the
occasion in pious and
gruesome ways of his
own. Some little time
ago a schoolmaster, who
had lost his billet, ended
his earthly woes by cut-
ting his throat, and the
serious coroner “sat on ”
the gashed remains. A
poor, tear-stained,
broken-down little
woman testified that she
was the widow of the
suicide, and that for some
time before his death he
had suffered much from
insomnia. The inquirer
into sudden departures
asked sternly if the de-
ceased drank? He didn’t.
Did he study hard ? It
seemed that he did. Ther
the coroner leaned for-
ward impressively and
asked, in a voice like the
grandfather of Poe's
raven : “Did he study
the Bible?'’ The witness
admitted that he didn’t.
Whereupon the coroner
looked at her with an eye
of infinite pity and re-
marked—“ Ah h-h-h-h !’
with an air that plainly
said the whole matter
was now fully explained.
The deceased didn’t read
the Bible ! There was a
dead silence for a few
seconds while the widow
wept unobtrusively in
the witness-box. At last
the coroner, who ap-
peared to feel this last
reply deeply, roused up a
little, wagged his head
drearily, and further re-
marked “ Hm-m-m-m-!”
Evidently the fact that the defunct didn’t read
the Bible had broken him all up. He seemed to
take no interest in the rest of the proceedings and
closed the case hurriedly. The matter was fully
explained, and further inquiry was a mere for-
mality. The departed schoolmaster didn’t read
the Bible. As for the little widow she trotted
wretchedly homeward, with an entirely new feel-
ing of broken-upness upon her. The awful fact
that her husband didn’t read the Bible had just
struck her like an avalanche for the first time.
Journalist: “Turner, the Victorian poli-
tical man of the day, has been familiar as junior
partner of Sam Lyons, the attorney, who has a
nice way with him when he ‘don’t like.’ I went
in to see Turner a while ago on political business,
but was received by Sam. * Look here,’ says he,
‘ you can’t see him, and that’s poz. He can do
what he likes out of doors, but I won’t have any
of that nonsense here.’ Which set me reflecting
on a little book of Albany Fonblanque’s, entitled
‘ How We Are Governed !’ The Imperial Cmsar,
who holds the country in awe, is governed by his
wife, and shakes in his boots before his partner.
Nathless, I hold Lyons to be wiser in his genera-
tion than Turner. Leave politics to the adven-
turers. Why should prosperous business men ba
such dolts as to touch ruination? Vide—Let’s
put ’em alphabetically, the asinine catalogue
Berry, Davies, Dibbs, Mirams, Parkes, and the
rest of the poor men, pursuers of the shadow
instead of the substance.”

Dr. Williams, the medical gent who pre-
sided over the birth of the Yorkling, has been
made a baronet. Probably the nurse has received
the Star of India. As for the Duchess, she
deserves the Victoria Cross for her valour in ven-
turing to have a baby at all.
The cables in Melb. Herald become more
and more ridiculous. There was one the other
day about a fellow who shot at a barmaid in
London. ihe cable-liar slushed preposterously
thus:—
The man asked the girl for a glass of ale. This was at
once supplied to him, whereupon the customer demanded
of the young woman, “Will you love me?” “No,” was
the decisive and unhesitating reply. The man had evi-
dently come quite prepared for this answer, and with his
mind made up. “I will either have you or your life,”
exclaimed the lover-assassin, as Miss Thompson fell in a
faint on the floor.
This is unique.

POLITICAL POINTS
There are more Scotchmen than English,
Irish, or Australians in the present N.S.W.
Assembly. ....
Two pounds a day for a session of 50 sitting
days is the Argus’ idea of an adequate system of
payment of members.
The K.C.M.G. motto is “ Auspicium
meiioris sevi,” which may be interpreted: A
pledge of boom times.
“A politician would sell his soul for his
mrtv but does not care a brass farthing for his
country.” —“ The Bauble Shop."
S.M. Hekald, of August 28, succeeds in
introducing to its readers in one sentence the
shearer-rioters of the West and the Darraba
murderers.
Turner will go for a “ wealth-tax ” whilst
Patterson travels on his income-tax promise,
coupled with an absentee-tax. Neither of the
patriots talks land-tax.
About 13 rejected members of last N.S.W.
Parliament are actively negotiating for the start-
ing of their own newspapers. “You must have
your own paper,” they say.
Premier Kingston’s conciliation proposals
have been adopted as the basis of the final report
of the Imperial Labor Commission. A fact which
has much pleased the S.A. Premier.
Purves, Q.O., has been asked to stand for
Vic. Legislative Council, and says he will do so.
Which shows how advancing age plays up with
the intellects of the brightest of men.
Solomon, the one really smart man in
S.A. Opposition, thinking that Speaker Jenkin
Cole's has a tendency to favor the Govt, in his
rulings, has christened the Premier, “ Jinks’
Baby.”
S.A. Government has put 2d. per gal.
excise duty on “colonial” beer. Will the Ade-
laide “ long-sleever ” remain at 2d ? Yes. Then,
look well to the administration of the Adultera-
tion law.
A country elector called lately on N.S.W-
Premier Reid to ascertain from his own lips
whether or not he sincerely means what he says
in re promised legislation. The countryman says
the papers which reach his selection so flatly con-
tradict one another on the subject that he deter-
mined to find out for himself.
It is already rumoured that Graham
Berry, if he gets back, will be Speaker of next
Vic, Parliament. The House has had enough
of Bent, and Berry, at all events, would
appear like a stately and pathetic ruin in
the chair, and would fill the position with a
certain fallen dignity which would look well.
Bent never had any dignity, or any pathos,
so the change would be an improvement in
various respects. In the drearily decorous
Vic. Assembly the demand is not so much for
a strong man as for a white-haired dignitary
well up in precedent, and Graham B. might
answer as well as anyone else. He is very
old and poor, and his oratorical powers are
nearly gone, and by putting him in th
Chair the House would feel that it
had done a kindly action which
didn’t cost it anything, and had
given him a lift in his last days.
N.S. Wales ex-Attorney-
General Heydon, M.L.O., wails
that “a tax on unimproved
land values would operate
towards confiscation,” and
“Outis,” of Sydney Tele-
graph, contradicts him
furiously. It is difficult
to understand why these
two persons should be so
excited. A tax on unim-
proved land values does
tend towards confiscation,
and there is no reason
why “ Outis ” should deny
the fact, any more than
there is why 0. G. Heydon
should wail. All taxa-
tion simply means that
Government confiscates
something all round to
keep the State going—the
only question is how to
confiscate on the most equit-
able principles, and to the
best advantage of everybody.
It is no use becoming frenzied
over a name. C. G. Heydon can
call it confiscation if he likes, or he can call it
Mesopotamia if it suits him better. The Bulle-
tin doesn’t object.
Speight is a sure candidate for West Mel-
bourne or Williamstown.
Parkes keeps silence in N.S.W. Assembly’
bub hia feelings towards the new Government can
be gleaned from the fact that his jackal in the
Legislative Council, John Jannery Davies, has
shown his teeth.
The working expenses of the Yic. railways,
in 1890, were .£915 per mile for the year. Since
then the cost has been reduced steadily till it
stands at <£545 per mile. Yet the railway deficit
keeps on just about the same.
Several members of the present N.S.W.
House have set apart .£IOO a year out of their
official grant to provide their election committees
with a monthly guzzle. Thus it is hoped patriotic
ardor will be kept at concert-pitch.
A Bill is before Maoriland Legislature to
bring the divorce-law into line with that of N.S.W.
Anglican Bishop Cowie, of Auckland —he will be
Primate when the Synod meets—has instructed
his clergy to preach against the innovation.

last time upon the question as to whether it was

He was the only man who saw the truth without

The essence of half -a - dozen separate
leaders in S.M. Herald during last half-year is
that in N.S. Wales a male Parliament may con-
cede female suffrage, but the first Parliament
elected on that basis is morally certain to repeal
the concession.
Just as the N.S.W. Government is pro-
posing to abandon what little Protection the pro-
vince enjoys, the S.A. Government is extending
its protective imposts. Yet the Reidites of
N.S.W. say that their policy must greatly assist
the Federation movement.
Apropos of the proposal to raise salaries of
M’s.L.A. from £l5O to £3OO, one North Queens-
land member spent the whole of his salary in
travelling expenses, and would have had to resign
his seat but for the steady support of a little
coterie of Democratic friends.
Q. Assembly has no longer an Opposition.
The sad seven who held that title have sworn by
the Powers to relinquish it, since the self-satisfied
seventeen of Labour won’t play with them any
more. So the Boodlewraith phalanx, 47 strong,
grows more arrogant than ever. ■
It is a vicious principle in N.S.W. educa-
tional system which reduces a teacher’s salary
because of a falling-off in the attendance—unless
the falling-off be chargeable to the teacher’s fault.
The present influenza plague is not so chargeable,
yet teachers are being docked.
Because employers acted severely towards
delegates who spoke at the weekly meetings of
the Adelaide Trades and Labor Council, the exe-
cutive, by 26 votes to 16, decided to exclude the
reporters in future. The National Ass always
deliberates in camera.
Three of Patterson’s men Andrewr»
Taylor and P. M. Salmon—were absent from the
Vic. Assembly, through illness or otherwise, when
the division-bell rang. Their votes would have
reduced Turner’s majority to 1, The other two
absentees, Armytage and G. D. Garter, had paired.
THEOLOGICAL ITEM.
ills Rev. : “ How is it you came to lose so many
of Regan’s sheep ? ”
Drover; “Accidents will happen, your Rev’nce.”
H. R. : “ Accident, you call it; I think it’s want
of knowing your business.”
D. (i indignant ); “You mind your own business
and let mine alone. If you knew your
particular line of shepherding a bit better,
there wouldn’t be so many of your lost
sheep all over the North.”
H. R. : “ Lost sheep, you call ’um; look here,
me boy, they’re nothing but a lot of uncon-
trollable goats, and the church will get no
good of ’um until the last gineral muster,
and we’ll have then the satisfaction of
giving delivery of ’um all to auld Nicholas

ye moind me now ?”
Victoria, a “self-governing country,
enjoys the felicity of seeing its Parliament throw
out a motion for the dissolution of the House one
hour, and having its imported Governor proclaim
a dissolution the next. In_ a democracy every-
thing is possible—except an imported Governor.
S.M. Herald is already urging the be-
wildered N.S.W, Premier Reid to have a short
session devoted mainly to fixing up the public
accounts in some intelligible shape, and postpone
all serious business till next year. _ Another device
for shunting the land-tax into a distant futurity.
Parkes snorted disdainfully when once
invited to become an alderman of Balmain, but
Premier Rosebery, retaining still his seat in the
London Council, professes pride in being known
as an alderman. This does not exalt the alder-
manic office; it merely shows how two great men
may differ.
If Victoria has learned anything from the
financial revelations and political scandals of the
past three years, its next Parliament won’t
include more than half-a-dozen of the old mem-
bers. The country will return new men on the
mere strength of the fact that they arc new, and
not necessarily dangerous characters.
“During my 25 years’ Parliamentary
representation I have not known one instance of
action of a corrupt character by a member of the
Legislature,” says Victoria’s sacked Premier. It
is all a matter of taste. One man might call it
corruption where another thought it merely a
little “gamey.”
The Argus prints this in intense italics :
The land, as the raw material of the great national
industry, should, as far as possible, go free.
The Bulletin says ditto, and advocates a
bouncing tax on land values to enable the land to
“ go ” with a little more freedom.
Vic. Premier Patterson, says Isaacs, M.P.,
“ put the income-tax in the forefront of the battle
for the same reason that David put Uriah there—
in the hope that it might be destroyed.” And
when it is destroyed Patterson, like David, will
settle down quietly with Bathsheba —Bathsheba,
in this caAfe, being a new loan.

A minimum-rate-of- wage clause, to apply
to all future contracts, has been adopted by
Essendon (Vic.) Council. Bendigo Council has
followed suit, and in its annual contracts rejected
all starvation-rate tenders. For street-clearing
the £624 tender was accepted against a .£486 one ;
and a cartage rate of 7s. 4d. per day against one
of 6s, 2d.
London Times :
If the proposals of the Maoriland Treasurer to extend
the late Mr. Ballance’s policy of lending money to settlers,
at a cheap rate of interest is successful its importance can
hardly be exaggerated. It seems likely to settle one of
the most pressing social questions. The utmost caution,
however, is needed in dealing with the question.^
The abysmal profundity of these observations will
strike everybody.
An ex-member of Vic. Parliament, shocked
at the shortage in the local railway revenue, has
resigned his railway-pass —which, as a representa-
tive prior to payment of members he is entitled to
hold for life—for a period of two years. This is
one of many instances of self-sacrificing patriotism
produced by the depression. But they have all
occurred outside of Parliament.
Mary Lee, high-priestess of the Adelaide
Women’s Suffrage movement, always distrusted
Kingston’s support, and did not hope to get the
principle approved by Parliament while he was
Premier. Kingston, on the other hand, says he is
confident that when women are allowed to vote
they will wipe such tactless people as Mary Leo
out of prominent political existence.
To make titles really valuable to Aus-
tralian politicians they should carry pensions of
.£5OO or £lOOO a year as compensation for lost
votes and forfeited influence. _ Even the paltry
O M G. brings disaster with it, for two of the
three S.A. civil-servants who have received it
lost public positions worth more than £lOOO a year
immediately after the tickets were pinned on their
coats.
The argument of N.S.W. Labor-member
Hughes, that members who are paid for doing
Parliamentary work should devote all of their
time to that work, falls into a ditch at this_ point,
viz, that if all members give all of their time all
should be paid equally. But Ministers get from
£l5OO to £2OOO while the rest draw £3OO. Mr.
Hughes has nowhere indicated that he will move
to lever down, and how can he attempt to lever
up ?
Now that M‘Court has been elected Chair-
man of Committees in N.S.W. Assembly, and
Angus Cameron’s hopes are blighted, The Bulle-
tin would like to know if the latter gentleman is
still as strongly opposed to payment of members
as be was five or six weeks ago ? It will be a grim
joke to see A. Cameron, who counted on the
Chairmanship and £3OO a year, voting with the
ayes on Knox’s motion to abolish payment of
members!
The Sydney D.T. admits, federationally,
that “at present its neighbors are far more willing
to meet N.S.W. fairly than they were in ’91.” A
proof that even the Dibbs pseudo-protective tariff
reacted on those “neighbors” as any logical
mind must have foreseen that it would do. For
instance, until Victoria began to fear that N.S.W.
would learn to fight her with her own weapons,
the federative spirit of that province was as dead
as a smoked fish,
Mr. Frank Madden, M.P., the new mem-
ber for Thrift in Vic. Assembly, burns with zeal
to emasculate the Education Act. “Young
women,” says this inspired patriot, “should not
receive an education above their prospective
stations in life, because otherwise their destiny is
the streets.” Which puts the social evil in a new
light : Education is the social evil. Yet Pinero
has said : “Of all forms of innocence ignorance
is the least praiseworthy.”
Hancock, who lost his seat for Collingwood
at last Vic. general elections through the Labor
party putting up three candidates for two seats,
is to contest Footscray at the coming election.
The present member, Clark, has done nothing to
warrant his re-election, and,' in a working-man a
suburb like Footscray, Hancock ought to stand a
big chance. His pet idea is a State Bank, which
he advocated when in Parliament, long before the
smashes of last year.
It is feared that the lawyer clan will be
more numerous than ever in the Vic. Assembly
after this election. At Brighton there is a com-
mendable disposition to get rid of Tom Bent, but
the leaders of the insurrection can only think of a
barrister to put into his place. Other oonstituen-
cies are inviting members of Matthew Davies s
profession to come along and be elected. A
lawyer is absolutely the worst use that any elector
can put his vote to, under present Victorian con-
ditions.
Some politicians with large families and
small revenues suggest that the income-tax exemp-
tion, instead of being, as in S.A., definitely fixed
at .£2OO a year, sfiould be reckoned at =650 a head
—giving the man with six or seven children a
deserved advantage. A similar idea deals with
the franchise. Every child, it is argued, should
be taken into account, the father getting an
additional vote each for the boys and the mother
for the girls, while, in case of death, the surviving
parent should lump the lot.
Soudan warrior Shipway, M.P., draws
public attention to the alleged fact that
the French General Frey has been allowed to
inspect the Sydney fortifications. The allega-
tion is now denied. While on the subject of
foreigners and local military information, vyhy
didn’t Mr. Shipway mention that complete
plans of all N.S. W. fortifications are now being
made in Sydney for the use of the English
military authorities —the only people ever likely to
have Sydney bombarded ?

PERCY GRAINGER, a young Australian pianist.
The Sydney Telegraph’s latest Single-tax
correspondent announces that the alienated lands
of N.S. Wales are worth, in their unimproved
state, .£427,700,000, therefore a tax of one penny
and four-fifths in the £ would yield .£3,000,000
per annum of revenue, and the Customs could be
entirely abolished. The fact that no one has ever
managed to figure out the value of all the private
lands of N.S.W., with buildings, fences and
all improvements thrown in, at much over
.£300,000,000, doesn’t trouble this kind of econo-
mist.
One of the many proposals to be urged
when N.S.W. Legislative Council comes under
discussion in the Lower Chamber, will be that a
bill passed in the Assembly and rejected by the
Council may be, at the expiration of a month,
once more submitted to the Assembly, when, if
passed, it forthwith becomes law. The advantage
claimed for this is that the Assembly and the
country will have the benefit of the criticisms and
opinions of the Upper House, without its despotic
dominance, and will be in a position to h t go a
bad bill, or complete a good one, as may seem
best.
The fact that the S.A. Legislative Council
passed such a measure as the Adult Suffrage Bill
is significant, in that it illustrates the wonderful
difference the Labor-members have made to that
once fossilised chamber. Kingston has a majority
in the Assembly, to which the Bill now goes, but
there is danger of its being mutilated by mongrel
liberals and a certain section who favor a property
qualification. S.A. owes this latest reform, if it
becomes law, entirely to the Labor members —
indeed, a majority of the Ministry wh’ch adopted
the measure was only recently bitterly opposed
to it.
Premier James Patterson believes, so it is
telegraphed, that “by industry and perseverance
the province will be saved.” This kind of plati-
tude reminds The Bulletin of that brilliant
speech which Frank Lincoln, the Yankee enter-
tainer, used to deliver, in which he repeated the
alphabet so impressively that the audience was
convinced on the spot. Lincoln used to say
“ ABODEF ” so eloquently that many of his
hearers swore off drink right there and became
thoroughly-reformed characters. Patterson says
the same thing as Lincoln, but without the
eloquence.
Percy Grainger, an interesting Australian
native whose face speaks for itself, promises to
make his mark as a pianist when his hands arrive
at maturity. For the past two years, Herr Pabst,
of Melbourne, has had young Grainger under
strict tuition, with such encouraging results that
the rigid professor, being now bent on leaving
Melbourne to its fate, is anxious for his .young
pupil to follow him to Europe. Little Grainger
has the artistio instinct, and the grave air of one
who means to do something big. In early life
he showed a special talent for drawing, but
at the advanced age of 12, which he attained
last month, Percy considers that his real
destiny is to give Paderewski*fits, and he
is growing his hair long and golden on pur-
pose. Undoubtedly he has in him the makings
of a brilliant musician. It is hoped that financial
assistance, necessary to bringing him on in the
best possible way, will be forthcoming. On Sept.
10th, Percy Grainger is to give a pianoforte reoifhl
at the Masonic Hall, Melbourne, and Dr. O’Hara,
who takes a great interest in the little fellow, will
sing between the acts.

Gov. Kintore announced his intention of
being present at Cyril Tyler’s second concert in
Adelaide, and the management had to despatch a
trembling messenger to inform his Ex. that he
could not get in without paying. The money was
forthcoming, but the argument was used that it is
not fair to endeavour to attract the public by
announcing Vice-regal patronage unless seats are
reserved free of charge. Seems reasonable, too.
# » »
There was serious debate in a meeting of
Adelaide Eight Hours’ Celebration Union as to
whether Lord Kintore should be invited to attend
the demonstration on Sep. 3, seeing that he does
not ask the members of the executive to Govern-
ment House. Eventually it was decided to send
the Earl his card.

When Gov. Duffs carriage rolled up to
the opening of N.S.W. Parliament House an
ominous silence prevailed. Even the carefully-
groomed grenadier A.D.C. aroused no interest,
although he stood in front of his Ex. for a couple
of minutes and made a number of beautiful salutes
to some imaginary persons in front of him, and
twirled an imaginary moustache seven times and
clanked his sword with many clanks. Meanwhile,
his Ex. removed his hat and twirled his mous-
tache and looked to see if there were any creases
in his pants. But no applause came, and only a
fat M.L.A. took off a greasy hat and looked loyal
—no one else did. It was indeed a frigid cere-
monial.

The news is wired all the way from Cool-
gardie that Lord Sudeley, whoever he may be,
fell off a camel and was not injured in any way.
This information practically amounts to the fact
that the camel got from underneath Lord Sudeley,
and as the camel didn’t know he was Lord Sudeley
there is nothing specially notable about the event.
Almost everybody falls off a camel when he first
tries riding that animal. If Sudeley had held on,
or if he hadn’t got on the camel at all, it might
have been worth while mentioning the circum-
stance. As it is, the fact that he doesn’t know
how to ride a camel is just as interesting as the
fact that he isn’t accustomed to chasing the wild
ass in Persia.

Editor Bulletin, — Sappho Smith says
Sydney “Lanceahs” once “sought to expel a
man from their ranks because they found out that
he sold socks for a living.” That, of course, was
not the ostensible reason. A certain sergeant re-
ported to the “gallant veteran ” in command that
the man in question had been “insubordinate.”
The man was asked what he had to say, and when
he opened his month, was told to hold his tongue,
not for selling socks, but for talking back. By
the way, there used to be a very pretty story
about a certain examination for commissions in
the Lancers. —Epio.

This evangelistic
swoop on Melbourne —
Cook, M'Neill, Carter-
makes darkness visible,
in re the ordinary pastors.
Preaching talent is at a
low ebb. Archbishop
Carr has no Geoghagan
or Father Barry to play
off. Bishop Goo has
naught with the flavor
of Liddon or Pusey.
The Presbyterians make
a splutter with Marshall,
but where are their
Cairns and Menzies ?
The Wesley ans have
nothing within oooey of
those whilom Melb.
lights, Dare, Butters,
and Draper. Where is
the Baptist Isaac New,
or Chas. Clark? To be
sure, the Independents
have the Ibsenic
Parkesian Bevan. He
reigns in the realm of
gentle dnllhood, this
Castle of Indolence.
The jury in the Dutton (Melb.) divorce-
case applied for refreshments after they had been
looked up for three hours, but Judge Holroyd
dismissed their petition on the ground that
refreshments didn’t seem to bring about the
desired result. At the end of another three hours
the 12 good men and true answered all the ques-
tions put to them, either unanimously or by a
majority of 10 to 2, and two of their unanimous
findings contradicted one another. To the Judge
and to every outsider who read his summing-up,
the incongruity of these two decisions upon one im-
portant point was apparent. When it was pointed
out that one of the answers must be wrong, the
jury foreman replied, “We did not understand it
in that way,” which was, under the circumstances,
an admission that their understanding had a very
limited range. The Dutton jury acted up to
recent Melbourne traditions by showing further
cause for dissatisfaction with the working of an
excellent system. His Honor dismissed them
with the hope that their appetites for refreshment
were not “diminished by enforced abstinence.”
Then they went off to draw the fees that had
been accumulating for many weary days.
The Dutton case was remarkable for the number
of times that females were ordered to retire from
Court, and for the steady reluctance with which
they left the spiciest details behind them. The
faces of these hungry Eves as they crawled out of
Paradise might have melted a heart of stone.
Their attempts to look as though they never
intended to wait for the disgusting evidence, any-
way ; their snorts of pity for the low-minded men
who could find a base delight in staying on to
devour the forbidden fruit; their feeble pretence
of being strong-minded women wilh “rights” to
uphold, and their poor little assertion of a deep
sense of insult—all these things together consti-
tuted a pathetic sight. Indeed, there is nothing
that calls for more sympathy than a member of the
softer sex tearing herself away from a Divorce-
court in the interests of her purity and innocence.
Justice Holroyd, in summing up the
Dutton divorce-case strongly in favor of plaintiff,
averred that the conduct of plaintiff’s father and
husband might have broken “the little woman’s
heart.” Gilbert and Sullivan’s Judge in “Trial
by Jury ” and Justice Holroyd express the same
sentiments. Thus, in “ Trial by Jury ” the Judge
sings:—
Oh 1 listen to the plaintiff’s case ;
Observe the features of her face,
The broken-hearted bride—(little woman.)
Console with her distress of mind.
From bias free of every kind
This trial must be tried.

A famous cockatoo, which may yet stand
for Parliament, was taken to Government House
to amuse Lady Hopetonn while she was in Ade-
laide. “ Cocky ” came from the Northern Terri-
tory, where he was educated by Trooper Haimes,
now an hotelkeeper. After the wonderful bird
had shown off his accomplishments as a preacher,
songster, talker, dancer, and so on, the Countess
asked whether he didn’t sometimes use forcible
language. The owner was constrained to confess
that he did. “ What would he say if I picked his
cage up and carried it across the room ?” enquired
her ladyship, and although he couldn’t be quite
certain, the owner thought it would be something
pretty strong. However, the Countess made the
experiment. Then the bird said : “ Oh, you silly
oh, you wretch !”

The sorest head in N.S.W., just now,
belongs to a certain State school-teacher. As a
single man he had for years presided over a very
pet suburban school, which is contrary to depart-
mental rules—only married men, for divers
reasons, being eligible for such positions. Re-
cently, the authorities acquainted this teacher,
along with many others similarly placed, of their
intention of removing him unless he forthwith
brought himself into line with the Act—
with the result that he hurried round and
got married soon after. But even the necessary
little delay proved fatal, for the papers sanction-
ing his removal had, meanwhile, passed through
the office, and the only answer he can receive now,
in reply to repeated petitions for reconsideration
of his case, is that the ciroumlooution machine
won’t work backwards.

Some iconoclast has knocked two large

of his leadership at Eureka stockade —was the

In Melbourne, a few days ago, a man sued
his wife for possession of a block of land which, he
alleged, had been bought with his money and put
in her name as trustee only. The wife asserted,
on the other hand, that the land had been bought
with her own money. She had formerly been in
possession of a largo sum, which she habitually
wore concealed in her clothes, and atone time she
carried as much as 2000 sovereigns in a band
strapped round her waist. The case rested entirely
on the assertions of the two parties, and the Court,
for want of corroboration, left the wife in posses-
sion. Nobody seemed to take any special notice
of the fact that the lady, by her own statement,
used to carry 321 b. of dead weight on her person.
If the Court had ordered 321 b. of iron to be riveted
on to the defendant underneath her clothes, and
then had adjourned the case for a month to note
the effect on her Constitution, it would at least
have been an interesting test of her credibility!

A Victorian ex-detective assures the writer
that there are at large in Melbourne at least 300
dangerous criminals, well-known to the local

ground that they act as “noses ” or “narks” for
detectives who are too lazy to follow up cases
themselves. Occasionally it is advisable to arrest
a “ nark ” along with the men he has given away,
so that the friends of the wretches who are “ put
away ’’ may not suspect the “ nose ” or “ nark,”
but it is rarely that the “nark” is convicted. If
he is, it is simply by arrangement with the police,
so that he may retain his billet as a “nark” by
thus dispelling any idea the friends of the con-
victed men have, that he is what he is, viz., a
traitor to his pals.

Turkish baths do not pay in Australia

often or so luxuriously. At the first Turkish
baths erected in Sydney (by Dr. Brereton) on the
site of the old Captain Cook Hotel, near the Ex-
change, the charge was ill Is., and you were
shampooed standing in five minutes. That was
in ’57. Now you get a marble-slab to lie on and

humanity with its clothes off, and know what a

shampooing continuously for 37 years, and 185,000
bathers have been kneaded like dough under his
dexterous fingers. 185,000! Fat, lean, shapely,

With their chubby cheeks and coo,

Still—she’d marry him to-morrow, if she could.

How to Get a Piano or Organ.
YOU, of course, want the highest quality of tone, action,
touch and beauty of exterior you can afford; but
you must have durability. Durability is an indispensable
condition, and however cheap an instrument may appear,
without durability it is worthless. Avoid the cheap
pianos, lor which there are agents in every town, who tell
—and often through ignorance believe—that they are
equal to the Steinway or the Erard or some other first-
class maker. Therefore, no matter how big a bargain you
think somebody else offers, investigate

stricken eagle. The auditor who spotted him was
originally a very junior clerk, clerk-CMm-messenger
in the Lands. The convicted accountant noticed
|,is sharpness and made him a full-blown
clerk. Eventually his reputation for cleverness
with figures took him into the Audit Office, where
he had the honour (?) of tripping up his whilom
chief. Another of life’s little ironies !

There was no execution in S.A. proper
between November, ’B3, and the hanging of
Brown on August 24 last. Since the province was
established in 1836, there have been 40 hangings
and 64 commutations of the death-sentence, but in
the early days, the records show, it was a capital
offence to steal small sums. One man was con-
demned to be hanged “ for stealing .£5 and other
articles from a tent,” in 1840 ; another “ for enter-
ing a house and stealing a pistol and other
articles;” a third for “stealing a watch, valued
£2, from the person;” and a fourth for “assault-
ing a man and stealing two sheep.” These men,
with many others, were transported to N.S. W. or
y.D.Ii. The only convicts hanged for less than
murder were George Hughes and Henry Curran,
who in 1840 were executed “ for stealing clothing
worth £4O from Michael Pindo, and firing with
murderous intent at his wife.”

A fruitful source of income to the R.C.
Church, says a Bulletin correspondent, is the
widespread practice among the faithful of collect-
ing stamps for presentation to their priests. The
fathers send them for sale to their foreign col-
leagues, who, in turn, remit similar parcels of
stamps, cancelled or otherwise, for sale in A us-
tralasia. This system, prevailing the world over,
makes the R.C. Church the most extensive stamp-
agency in existence. To such an extent has this
stamp-collecting mania taken hold of all good
Catholics, that the Sydney G.P.O. authorities
have found it necessary to forbid their Maloneys
to practise it in the post-offices.

The Victorian lighthouse keepers are
charged 355. a month for rent by Government.
Fancy paying to live in a lighthouse ! The men
who are in charge of the lighthouse on that dreary

handsome suburban villa, with a lawn and foun-
tain in front, and a hotel inght opposite the back

has been paying wages as ploughman and general

prehensively described as being in Australia. She
grew tired of washing kitchen pots and pans, and
donned man’s clothes, looking a handsome youth.
She often drove her boss’s cart into town, and in
country dances mixed, unrecognised, with her
former associates.

Dear Bulletin, —I can easily understand
how that sea-serpent was seen at Newcastle
(N.S.W.) by scores of respectable witnesses. The
Oorean war raised a big hope that China would
come to Newcastle for coal. Hope raised a thirst.
The quenching of that thirst raised the sea-
serpent. A most natural sequence. Hope or
despair, joy or trouble, funeral or wedding, is
equally efficacious in producing sea-serpents. —D.

In a Parramatta slander-case last week a

If Frank Tory Madden strolls forth in the streets
When the night nears the dawn of to-morrow,
Some golden-haired charmer he possibly meets
Whose life is a matter for sorrow—
Whose calling appalling
Betokens a falling
From virtue, and wakens his sorrow.
He rubs the salt tear from his horrified eye,
But flees, like a senator wary.
From the creature so bold, saying, “Once she was shy
And chaste as a beautiful fairy.”
Frank Madden, the sad ’un,
Sobs, “ Though she’s a bad 'un,
I’m sure she was once in a dairy'.
“ O, why did we wean her from butter and milk
By giving her State education,
Which taught her to sigh after satins and silk.
And lifted her out of her station?
(A yearning for learning
In girls that are churning
Is not the right thing for their station).
She came up to Melbourne to look tor a place—
Poor lamb from the State seminary—
And now, Heaven help her; she calls herself ‘Grace,
When her true appellation is Sairey.
I view in her ruin
Those radicals’ doin’—
They taught her too much for the dairy.”

Bit by bit Gladstone is assuming the posi-

The dictum of Frank Madden, who is fast
developing into the boss lout of the Victorian
Assembly, that “it is not necessary to teach
people more than is required for their stations ” is
certainly a fine sample of ignorance, yet it isn’t
quite so ignorant as it looks. Madden, at all
events, speaks on a subject with which he is
familiar. He hasn’t been taught more than is
required for his station—in fact, he has been taught
a great deal less. And if he feels that it isn’t
necessary for him to know more than he does,
then he is sincere, anyhow. The questions that
naturally arise just here, however, are : Does
Madden really know how darned ignorant he
really is; also, does he know what is his station?
The fact that he temporarily occupies a place in
the Legislature doesn’t prove that it is his station,
any more than the fact of a goat eating posters
proves that a goat can read !


THE TWO
GENUINE ARTICLES :
CLEMENTS TONIC,
FLETCHER’S PILLS,
IMITATED!
BUT UNRIVALLED
AND UNEQUALLED,
CLEMENTS TONIC is a scientific chemical
food and restores the tissue wasted by the voca-
tions of every day life, is a prompt and safe
remedy for neuralgia, nervousness, weakness,
debility, liver complaint, dropsy, and chronic
indigestion.
FLETCHER’S PILLS cure heartburn, back-
ache, headache, liver torpidity, dyspepsia and all
complaints of the stomach and bowels.
These two remedies have been thoroughly tested
in all the hot countries of the world. They are
sold at a price within the reach of all people.
Evidence is forwarded free on receipt of name and
address that will satisfy the most sceptical as to
their virtues. They are sold everywhere, but
care must be taken that the genuine are obtained
or the money and time are wasted and the disease
so much the more serious.

The N.S.W. Savings Bank, unlike its Melb.
relative, has kept strictly out of the land-boom business,
with gratifying results. Its biggest loan is £BOOO, whereas
the Melb. institution has as much as £125,000 advanced
on a single mortgage; and its average mortgage is £B7O
against £16,340 in Melbourne. As a result, the N.S.W.
Savings Bank has only £15,000 of foreclosed property on
hand, while the Victorian bank is now encumbered with
£570,000 worth of more or less unsaleable bricks and dirt.
There is a moral in this.

The funds of the Maoriland Government Life
Insurance Department now amount to £2,128,000, making
it, with the exception of the A.M.P. Society, by far the
biggest institution of its kind in Australasia. With the
exception of the A.M.P., it is also the most cheaply-
managed life office in these provinces, and is a standing
refutation of the theory that Government control is
synonymous with extravagance. Further, while the
A.M.P. has apparently reached about the lowest possible
minimum of expense, the Maoriland institution issteadily
reducing its working costs, and ought, in a few years, to
get down to the level of its bigger rival. For the present
its percentage is higher simply because a comparatively
small concern is always more costly to work than a large
one. Its premium-rates are lower than those of any
other Australasian office, and fully half its funds are
invested in Government and municipal debentures, and
only one-quarter in mortgages, and one-twentieth in land
and buildings, which means a lot of additional security.
Too much mortgage may one day prove an awkward em-
barrassment for many Australian life societies.

It is now very plain indeed that scores of pas-
toralists are out of sympathy with the action of the P.U.,
whereby the existing shearing trouble was brought about.
The P.U. move was obviously the outcome of a high-
handed desire to assert complete mastery over the
shearers ; and there are heard on all sides expressions of
regret that the modus vivendi of 1891 was not submitted
for revision in joint conference. Even now it should not
be too late to confer.

W. G. Spence withers with well-meant pity the
unionist bushman who melts his cheque in the pub. “He
is liberal enough whilst he has cash, but what avails that,
if lie has none when he most needs it ? No man can fight
starvai ion, and hence, in all our struggles with capitalism,
the’fight has, at the end, narrowed down to a question of
tucker. It is when men feel that another week would
win, and yet they are penniless, that those who flashed
their money realise its usefulness. If all our boys would
■ lily put the peg in for a year, and save up a good reserve-
fmil, they could simply laugh at the P.U. and all the
bunking crowd of Australia.”

At the meeting of shareholders of the Bank of
New Zealand, held in London, theotherday, the chairman
announced that the B.N.Z. Estates Co. had never earned
more than li per cent, on its nominal capital, and for the
year just closed it earned nothing. The B.N.Z. holds
alnfnst all the shares in this unprofitable concern, which
(loaded debentures in London to the nominal value of
cl 500,000 at over 6 per cent, interest—for that is what it
really amounts to. Therefore the bank has some
£2,000,000 of its funds locked up in a concern which now
pays no interest, while it has not only to find interest on
»ud funds for its depositors, but to find, every now and
tl eu, a considerable slab of the principal when deposits
f ill due. Moreover, affairs having got so bad with the
Estates Co. they may easily get worse, and the co. may
■ veh have to make calls on its principal shareholder, the
hank, to meet debenture interest.
» • • • , ,
The one thing that is certain now is that the re-
constructed bank should have stopped paying dividends
altogether some four years ago, but this strictly logical
course would probably have done it almost as much harm
as good. The B.N.Z. acquired its hopeless mass of
I mded property at the time of the boom, and if it could
clear out on the top of another boom all would be well,
hut the whole policy of Maoriland now is to avert booms,
and there is no sign of one on the remotest horizon.
Possibly the English debenture-holders may be paid off
out of the new State-guaranteed capital, but the deben-
ture-holder who has got a reliable 6 per cent, security
generally objects to be paid off before his time ; and,
meanwhile the interest extracted by the British Shylock
is eating the heart out of the Estates Co., and the Estates
Co. is sitting on the chest of the B.N.Z. like a nightmare.
Meanwhile, by special authority, the Estates
Co.’s shares are to he reckoned in the balance-sheet of the
B.N.Z. at par, making an item of £1,850,000 or so.
If they were put down at their probable market value—
whatever the market value of a stock which never realises
over 1J per cent, may be—it would make a truly dreadful
gap in the balance-sheet. The 8.N.Z., with its State
guarantee, is the very safest bank in Australasia for its
depositors. For its shareholders it looks like a tomb.

The Bulletin has come to the conclusion that
it is about time some of the more intelligently Protec-
tionist provinces of Australasia put a tax of £5OOO per
annum on every foreign proprietary insurance co.—fire,
life, marine, accident, and otherwise—doing business in
these provinces. These institutions are among the many
unsuspected leaks through which this country’s coin
drifts away to dear old Hingland. There are 46 of them,
so far as Thb Bulletin can reckon on a hurried estimate,
doing business in Sydney alone. Counting in several
which do business in Melbourne, but are not represented
in Sydney, there are probably 50 of them pervading Aus-
tralasia-more than all the local offices put together.
Some of these have agencies in every town of importance
from Geelong to Carpentaria. Many of them were im-
mense affairs before the first Australian insurance co. was
started—some of them before the first convict reached
Botany Bay, and by reason of their vastness and
general imposing aspect they get, in many locali-
ties, the best business. They supply no want
of any kind ; if they were absent the Australian offices
would do the business quite as satisfactorily. They
supply no employment which would not be supplied by
local companies if they were wiped out. Even those who
believe in the advantages of bringing English capital into
Australasia can find no excuse for their presence, for
they invest no English capital in the country. They
simply earn profits, and send them away to help in paying
divs. to British shareholders.
How much they take out of the country, giving
nothing whatever in return, it is impossible to tell.
Judging by the business done, however, and assuming
that their profits average about the same as those of the
local offices, it would be not less than £lOO,OOO per
annum. Making no allowance whatever for interest, this
means that, in the last decade, £1,000,000 in hard cash has
gone out of Australasia with absolutely nothing received
in return, and this drain is going on continuously. Mean-
while the few Australasian offices which do business in
England only get the poorest kind of risks from the
conservative Bull, and, in a large number of cases, lose
more than they gain. If the Australasian provinces
would agree to strike every foreign proprietary insurance
office doing business in this country with a tax of £5OOO
or so per annum, it would stop a tolerably large leakage
of Australian legal tender. Also, it would be a legitimate
application of Protectionist principles, and yet one which
even a Freetrader could hardly object to. The principle
of giving £lOO,OOO a year, or thereabouts, for nothing,
doesn’t come into the programme of any political party,
so far as this paper is aware.

The N.S.W. Mortgage, Loan and Agency,
a comparatively small English Co. which helps to bring
the blessings of British capital, home, to the benighted
Australian, held its annual meeting in London the other
day, and reported that in the last ten years it had
received £325,300 in interest from Sydney, that it had
every reason to anticipate doing even better in the future,
and that one of its biggest investments in station pro-
perty was paying 11 per cent. This is the sort of absentee
landlord who wants to be struck with a tax which will
make him sit up.

The Australian banks have now, with hardly an
exception, brought down their deposit rates to 3J per
cent., and, as Sydney Tbleoraph remarks, their great
difficulty is to find a profitable outlet for their money,
and “to get rid of their costly and unwieldy cash
y
balances.” This wheeze grows dismally and horribl
monotonous. Speaking of reconstructed banks, the
Commercial of Australia can get rid of a whole lot of its
unwieldy cash balance by buying up and extinguishing
its long-dated deposit receipts at 13s. and its short-dated
ones at 16s. 6d. or 175., and thereby make a big imme-
diate profit and get rid of the 4J per cent, interest. The
Colonial, City of Melb. and Q.N.B. can plant out their
“ unwieldy cash ” in the same securities, and make about
30 percent, profit, besides the saving in interest, at one
jump ; and all the others, barring the Commercial of
Sydney, can make a rise in a similar fashion. Or, if that
isn’t good enough, they can put the money they are bor-
rowing at 3J per cent, into Govt, stock at 4 per cent., or
they can buy each other’s paid-up preference shares,
which mostly yield about 8 or 9 per cent, on cost price.
There never was a time since banking first began in Aus-
tralia when an unwieldy mass of money could be invested
more easily and more profitably. More than one bank
could lay out £400,000 by slow degrees in its own deposits
just now, and make £BO,OOO by the transaction, and also
save an outlay in interest of over £20,000 a year, and help
to restore “ confidence ’’ at the same time.

Now that Matthew Davies has been informed—
and most justly so—that he can’t get his discharge unless
he pays the statutory 7s. in the £, people begin to think
again about Jeems Munro and his little troubles. Nobody
remembers exactly how much or how little Munro paid,
but it was a mere trifle, and the Court never asked him
for 7s. in the £; it gave him his release at the first
time of asking, and almost blubbered on his chest for
sympathy as it did it. It was the same Judge, too.
Where on earth does the difference come in ?

Apropos the now-watchful bill-clerks in Southern
banks. A few years ago one of the wealthiest firms in
western N.S.W., consisting of four partners, found them-
selves paying their bank 9 per cent, for the immense
floating overdraft necessary for their large business, while
their trade bills were being discounted at 8 per cent. All
the partners had large private means, and, to save 1 per
cent., hit upon the idea of causing the firm to draw upon
each member, and one member upon another. As the
individual member’s credit was good, and his private
account was at another bank, the firm’s banker could not
refuse to discount the paper,

The new firm of Goldsbrough, Mort and Co.
held its first meeting in Melbourne on August 28. The
net profits for the past nine months are only £8366, which
is partly owing to the reconstruction expenses and partly
owing to the fact that the firm lost the best part of
last wool season, and the profits which should have
accrued, through its suspension. The item of goodwill,
£85,000, has been wholly written off ; £33,000 has been
written off the premises account; and all past losses have
been provided for. During the present wool season the
big firm of G.M. and Co. may be expected to do business
on its old scale, and to make profits in something more
like the style of former days.

A very pillar of the church who employs a large
.number of assistants, has for some years past dummied
his liabilities on to certain of his employes. One of them
(who had to fork out any profits his dummied shares
yielded in the Boom period) has just had his house and
furniture sold off for calls really due by his saintly em-
ployer. Were it not that the unfortunate fellow has no
hope of getting other employment, a big expose would
take place. As a matter of fact, all the comfort he has
is his employer’s assurance that “although I cannot
help you, your billet of £4 a w'eek in the co. is secure.”

A certain trading firm, the bulk of whose un-

“contingencies, losses,” &c. Those “in the know ” as
to the firm’s position, smile so broadly at the proposal
that the corners of their mouths meet where the back

Some hundreds of prominent Melbourne men

The reconstructed Melbourne Permanent Build-
ing Society issues a pathetic balance-sheet. Its entire
nominal assets amount to £620,000, and of this £447,500
is represented by unsaleable houses and lands which have
been abandoned to the society by the mortgagors. Loans
of £35,000 on miscellaneous securities are expected to
pan out for £BOOO in all. The entire rentals for the year
are under £5OOO, about one per cent, on the cost price of
the properties, and the entire income is £11,500. As this
doesn’t nearly cover the interest promised to the recon-
structed debenture holders these investors are cut down
from 5 to 3 per cent. Defalcations by a late official con-
tinue to turn, up in unexpected places, and the familiar
moral stench of Melbourne pervades the whole lamentable
story.

Nothing came of the proposal to get James
Mirams whitewashed in the Vic. Assembly. With the
breakdown of the Davies prosecution all desire to try the
“Martyr Mirams” game upon a gullible public naturally
ceased, but it is just as well to remember that the idea
was mooted at a time when Matthew was in peril, and
banks were getting reconstructed, and cold beads of sweat
were bespangling a number of bald-heads.

G. R. Sims on the murder-case reporter :—“ He
gets hold of the relatives both of the accused person
and of the murdered corpse. He asks them questions
which would not be allowed to be put by counsel, and he
prints the answers. He makes himself at once judge and
counsel, and sums up a case against a prisoner who has
not yet been put on trial. Why the representatives of
justice allow this to go on is a mystery.” The evil will be
rectified as soon as a lawyer gets accused of murder. The
manager of Melb. Standard was promptly sent to prison
for revealing the unanimity of the Grand Jurymen who
found a true bill against Matthew Davies, anyway. There
was a case in which the Law couldn’t allow the interests
of an accused person to be prejudiced by a newspaper.
Not much.

At last one sees a ray of light dawning upon the
beery waste of Victorian breweries. The auditors of
one establishment have the candour to suggest, in their
report on the wmeful balance-sheet just presented, that it
is most advisable that a much greater provision should be
made for contingencies. The balance-sheet, by-the-bye,
carefully omits to specify what the Co. owes to the banks
interested. The liabilities in that respect are wisely
lumped in with “ sundry creditors.” At least two banks
would not like the public to know how much they have
on the brewery.

lb is nob always remunerative for a trader to
advertise that he “keeps nothing in stock that is not
quite up to date.” Any sleepy sort of trader could im-
port the old-fashioned hanging hall lamps with chains
attached, and no notice would be taken of it by the
Customs, but when a very smart up-to-date importer con-
tinued importing large quantities of these lamps with
chains for 12 months after the demand for them had
ceased, the Customs smelt such an abnormally big rat
that they examined the smart firm’s latest importation
and found that the chains (five to six feet long each) were
all hall-marked 18-carat gold alberts subject to a heavy
duty. The cruel part of the affair is that, instead of
demanding the duty for gold chains, the Customs pre-
ferred to buy the lamps and chains at the invoiced prices
(as for brass). Only the eminence of the importer has
prevented the affair being made public ; but he privately
cherishes the fact that the Customs have got about 320
feet of 18-carat gold alberts at the price of brass.

Rents fall slowly in Sydney. Were it not that
provisions are so phenomenally cheap, hundreds of subur-
ban houses now let would be tenantless. On Saturday
last, at Beimore Markets, fine cauliflowers were sold at
a shilling a dozen, and at almost any suburban butcher’s
beef and mutton can be bought at a penny per lb.
The movements of the co. formed, in Sydney,
to publish a Journal to be called the Post are involved in
some mystery, but it is understood that the paper—
capital £40,000 in 80,000 shares at 10s,—will shortly
appear.
* » * *
In Adelaide a co. of 30,000 shares of 10s. is
being formed to publish first a weekly, and ultimately a
daily Radical paper.
» * * »
Some leading shareholders of the Australian
Star, Sydney, propose to sell the paper for what it will
fetch, and start a morning daily in the Protectionist—
which, being interpreted, probably means the Dibbs—
interest. Now, the Star is just at present paying 6 per
cent., and, with decent luck, may pay 12 before long.
The Dihbs party is not likely to crush 6 per cent. If the
Star shareholders sold out, they would be letting go the
bone for the shadow. Any daily newspaper which can
pay 6 per cent, is potentially a big fortune. But there is
plenty room in Sydney for an ably-conducted Protec-
tionist morning paper.

A number of Southern railway-clerks have been
dismissed lately for embezzlement, practically aided and
abetted by the department. The unfortunate wretches,
luxuriating on about £BO to £lOO per year, were allowed
to hold over cash receipts until the end of the month.
Consequently they enlarged their custody for a couple of
months additional, partly to satisfy usurers, etc., until
each man had a debit balance of £3O or £4O. The depart-
ment “sacked” those who couldn’t pay—widows’ sons,
etc., and kept on the young gentlemen who had only to
tell the “ guvnah ” about the beastly thing. However,
no one was prosecuted. A public scandal would not have
suited high officials.

The inauguration of wool sales in Australia,
a season or two ago, created not a little uneasiness
among London brokers, who saw that ultimately the
wool business would slide away from them. Lon-
don’s day as the central emporium is rapidly going.
Foreign buyers are coming by each mail-boat to be in
readiness for the Melb. and Sydney sales, shortly to com-
mence, and among them the Yankees are likely to be
strongly represented. Free wool for the States has
caused the erection in Broadway, New York, of an
exchange, 11 storeys high, which will have a floor space of
four acres, and hold 65,000 bales. It is certain, also, that a
lot of wool for England will not go through London, for
Liverpool is also helping towards the coming knock-out.
The sales at Berlin and Antwerp are also increasing enor-
mously, and continental buyers say they will soon have
done with wool that filters through London. They are
coming to buy at first hand.

There were only 117 creditors at the very secret
meeting held down South last week by a Polish gentle-
man. Strangely enough, none of the creditors, except a
few gentlemen of the stein, burg, heim and sillier class,
showed any enthusiasm when the glorious fact was ascer-
tained that there was a surplus of over £9OOO in the
estate. Not a few of the Christian creditors would be
glad to handle a ready-money div. of ss. in the £ and cry
quits, but the berg, lieim and stein majority decided on
an “ extension.” The amount involved is nearly
£175,000.

Another Southern lawyer’s defalcations have

tice of things in general when he learns the number and
extent of similar transactions that have taken place since

Advts. in the matrimonial columns of the Aus-

he appears before her as a financial-agent with an immense
gold-mine or other scheme, mostly bogus, to float. He
doesn’t want the woman if he can get her cash. Cash—

The move to cut printers’ wages in Sydney
follows the introduction of the Linotype machine, but is
not endorsed by the leading houses. The trade suffers
greatly from cut-throat competition, and while this con-
tinues a wage-reduction, while bleeding the men white,
would benefit neither the employers nor their customers.
The trouble at a certain daily newspaper office arises out
of the utter want of sympathy between the comps, and
their employer who, when talking Linotype lately, is said
to have offered them 6d. per 1000 as an alternative.

A correspondent writes to say that the liability
of insurance co.’s to pay for damage caused by the use of
automatic fire-extinction appliances has not yet been
legally tested. Sydney fire oo.’s allow a rebate of 25 per
cent, to insurers using the Grinnell Sprinkler, so that
inferentially they are prepared to stand the racket. Pos-
sibly they would in cases of trifling damage ; but, as our
correspondent points out, if the conditions on their
policies do not compel them to recognise the liability
would they come smiling to the scratch in the face of a
claim for £lOO,OOO ? This is a matter that both under-
writers and insurers might take into consideration with-
out delay.
Apropos of fire risks : Some years ago a big firm
of warehousemen in a Maoriland city had a special rebate
in their insurance premium in consideration of their sub-
dividing the premises with a fire-proof wall, communica-
tion being maintained between the two sections by means
of iron doors. Under the special conditions of the policy
these were to be kept closed at night. A fire broke out,
one of the iron doors had been left open an inch or two, a
little spurt of fire-brigade water got through the crevice,
and wrecked £lO,OOO worth of feathers and artificial
flowers, and for this damage the companies could not be
made to pay.

The latest Queensland wind-raising idea. A

who has vacant shops in a quiet neighborhood, is selected.
A shutter is detached from the shop, and laid on the foot-
path. One of the schemers—wearing goggles—promptly
falls over this, in the presence of a confederate. He then
pretends to be in great agony, and soon attracts a crowd
of sympathisers. A policeman is then sent for, and the
injured man helped into a cab. Next day, a third con-
federate calls on the owner of the shop, pretends to be a
relation of the injured man, relates the cause of the
accident, and mentions the fact of a witness being present
when the accident occurred. Victim generally cashes up

“Walter R. Cuthbertson, C.E., P.R.G.S., F.I.

equipped men from going to W.A. goldfields, and speaks
of intense heat, swarms of flies, and the bush in which
many a poor man leaves his bones. The writer happens
to know of one “well-equipped” party who came to
W.A. from London, some time ago. They consisted of a
lot of London johnnies, who called each other “Chappie;”
had magnificently-appointed horse-gear, patent beds,
which were aired weekly on the saloon-deck of the mail-
steamer, tents lined with green baize, all manner of
shooting-irons; and who bought a number of ''‘bathing
suits for Lake Austin,” under the impression that that
salt-pan w’as full of water. Having painted Albany red
they had an auction-sale of surplus luggage in Perth, and
subsequently moved out of Geraidton at the rate of five
miles a day. What became of that gorgeously-equipped

Which is the more foolish—Sydney D.T. in
publishing, or O’Sullivan, M.P., in writing that screed on
economical gold-mining in Victoria ? O’Sullivan says
8-dwt. reefs are made to pay well at Bendigo. That is the
first error. Bendigo reefs don’t average 8 dwts., and
many are made to pay at 4 dwts. The O’S. has evidently
written a circular letter to Bendigo mine-inspectors and
managers, asking for the conditions under which low-
grade mines are made to pay. The replies are such as
any mining man would make to a mining tyro: first have a
big lode, next a big battery to crush it with ; the hulk of
the gold should be free, and the small percentage retained
in the pyrites should he caught by concentrators. The
D.T. prints the replies as something new.
Mr. O’Sullivan declares there are many large
reefs in N.S.W. which will go lOdwts. to the ton and yet
have never been made to pay. Weil, if he will show the
writer one big permanent lOdwt. available lode he
can get £lOOO for his trouble. It may be news to the
O’Sullivan and the D.T. that there are men in N.S.W.
who have been years looking for big lOdwt. reefs and
never found them ; that there are profitable reefs working
in N.S.W. which don’t average Bdwts. ; that others have
been made to pay at five, and that reefs can be worked
cheaper, as a rule, in N.S. Wales than at Bendigo,
because there is no expensive haulage such as is involved
in the deep mines of Bendigo, and fuel isn’t so dear.
Bendigo has bigger crushing batteries, 'tis true, but these
N.S.W. will have as soon as the permanency and lOdwt.
average of the reefs warrant their erection. Mr. O’S.
also resurrects the Bendigo tailings-prohlem, and speaks
about the Luhrig machine as a gold-saver instead of a
concentrator, and in many other ways writes himself
down a fool for meddling with other people’s business.

Hydraulic sluicing of the Shoalhaven River
drift has not been a success. Everybody seems to admit
that the wash is good enough ; but with the expense of
pumping on one hand and the loss of gold on the other,
the industry is languishing, and even the mines with
gravitated water have a spasmodic existence. In the
light of recent experience it should now be easy to
definitely ascertain whether it would pay to gravitate the
water from the head of the river on to the mines which
are trying to live on pumping, as well as all the others. A
Govt, survey has proved that the water can he brought, in
and the value and extent of the wash could be demon-
strated by bore-holes. There is the chance of a mighty
big industry here ; but it means big money.

Another life is said to have been given to the

Re the Wyalong jumpers. Something should
take the place of jumping in mining law. Why not have
monetary penalties for non-working, and why should not
the holder of a mining lease be allowed to concentrate (he
labour of a year into a month ? This is the law of the
United States, where, also, a mine-owner is allowed to
follow the apex of the lode- i.e., he doesn’t lose it on the
underlay. It is equitable that the discoverer should not
give up possession of a reef which happens to run at a
rapid angle instead of going down vertically.

grazing sheep. Had he offered but a couple of pounds an
acre he might have got the property, but his handsome
price caused the owner to make enquiries, when, for the
first time, she became aware of the reef running through
the place. Arrangements are now being completed for
the sale of the land to another party at £20,000.

capacity and is now treating 400 tons of ore weekly.
There are already hosts of concentrators which will treat
sulphides satisfactorily, but the stumbling-block has
hitherto been that the value of the concentrates pro-
duced is less than the expense of concentration plus the
cost of mining and incidental charges. The economies

claims, allow a good margin on the cost of treating the

Dear Bulletin,—You are hardly fair to Wya-
long. The 2GOOOZ- gold produced to date (allowing those
figures to be correct) has been won under great difficul-
ties; the major portion of the stone carted over 20 miles
over roads calculated to bog a duck; the remainder
treated at a one-horse rattletrap. Neither of these
batteries is capable of properly dealing with the Wyalong
gold, which is unusually fine.
As for there being no stone to justify the erec-
tion of other batteries, facts speak for themselves ; there
are at least 4000 tons stone at grass waiting to be crushed.
Capital fights shy of Wyalong, because the claims are
held under the block system, and there is no chance of a
syndicate obtaining a big lease.—H.J.G.

of the place the more I am convinced that Wyalong has
come to stop, and, what’s more, to stop for a very long
time. There’s plenty of stuff here right enough. All
that we’re waiting for is the starting of the batteries.”

Five hunlred odd ounces from scwt. stone was
not bad for “Micky the Priest” on the Mainland (Mur-
chison, W.A.). It is not long since the Bishop’s visit to
the Cue, when “ Micky ” received a blessing, and straight-
way on the very next holy day (a Friday) struck
“Noice, coarse gould.” He should have called his reef
the “Great Banana” in memory of his not-too-palmy
days at the stall on Circular Quay.

Scott M‘Laren’s claim on the new rush (Mt.

the trial crushing at Orooodile. Over 160 men are wort*

ing on the employes of the Mount Morgan 00. who
regard any successful outside digging* as a harbor of

The Mount Lyell mine has just been visited by
Mr. Stewart, the new manager of the Broken Hill Pro-
prietary claim. Mr. Stewart made a minute inspection
of the property, and was surprised at its great richness
and the facilities which it offers for comparatively cheap
working on the open-out system. The rich vein of silver,
which has panned out so well for the Co. (650,0000 z. to
date), is still being followed and shows 100,000 oz. in sight
at present. The working of this vein alone represents a
net profit of £76,000 to the Co.

After all the puffing and dining and the use
made of Colonel North’s powerful name, Zeb Lane’s

cent, of the capital.

Warden Jephson on the Coolgardie strike:—
“Formerly the men got £4 a week when living was much
dearer, therefore they were now better off on lower

Several of the papers have stated that the
Bayley’s Reward claim had taken out £250,000 for the
year ended August—an over estimate of £lOO,OOO.

The writer has another report on the Wealth of
Nations, which says that the Londonderry is by far the
greater mine.
* • • *
Gardiner, one of the Londonderry owners, has
left the field for Sydney. Dawson got as far as Albany
and was recalled. He is now at Kurnalpi. Dawson, jun.,
last week retired from Joint Stock Bank ledger-keeping,
and this week left for Coolgardie.

Where exemptions are easily obtained, as in
N.S.W., jumping is little feared, but at Coolgardie, if the
Warden continues to refuse exemption applications,
many mines will be abandoned shortly.

The Londonderry gold is much mixed up by
Australian dailies, which speak of about £27,000 coming
from two “shoots” (meaning shots), and ISOOozs. and
tailings sent to Bayley’s for treatment. They have not
got the bang of it, which is this. Under the terms of the
sale made by Dawson to his mates, Huxley aud Mills,
and Carter to his mate, Elliott, all the gold and specimens
then raised had to be divided, and the division has just
taken place. The £27,000 represents the amount sold, ■
the 1500 oz. that which has recently been dollied from the
unconsidered specimens, and in addition to this there is
Big Ben, five-sixths of which belongs to Elliott, and the
remaining sixth to Huxley, who would not sell his share
in it; also, a number of big, rich stones, which were con-
sidered too marvellous to consign to the dolly and have
been apportioned among the shareholders. One Dawson
sent across to Sydney a few weeks ago; others are in
the Union Bank, Sydney, awaiting his arrival. Besides
this, another two or three tons containing thousands of
ozs., representing the stone broken from the surface and
the 50ft. level, have been taken to the Union Bank, Cool-
gardie, and stored in the log hut. That is the correct
history, up to date, as far as a man who has seen the
mine and knows the owners can tell it.

John Wallace, the veteran Vic. mining specu-

Castlemaine, where he has never been since ’53. Asked
if he sympathised with the movement to re-work these

extent of £5OO. It is proposed to run the old tailings
through by dredge-sluicing, used in Maoriland, and
recently introduced by Wallace at Yackandandah.

Through the town of Eucla, which lies by the
coast on the border of W.A. and South Australia, there
goes a steady procession of men, horses and camels bound
for Coolgardie. A recent tally showed that, in two days,
30 men, 36 camels, and 42 horses passed, all going West.
They were all overlanders from the East, and some of
them had walked 1500 miles before they reached the
border, and had 900 miles more to go. Yet the coast track
by Eucla is said to be the worst land route into W. A.,
and the procession that tramps round the Great Austra-
lian Bight is only a small part of the great exodus. They
come even from the remotest parts- of Queensland, on
horseback, on camels, and on foot—about half of them on
foot. Yet no one thinks anything in particular of these
brave pioneers, while the fact that Gov. Kintore travelled
in state across Australia,|with his feather-bed, and bis
portable wine-cellar, and his doctor, is cabled all over the
empire.

Editor Bulletin, —-If, as you state, there
are in King, George, Pitt, and William-streets,
Sydney, 63 oyster and fruit shops, there are only
three oyster-shop keepers who are not Greeks, no
matter what names are oyer the doors. Your
remarks as to the character of the Greeks are all
true —they have beaten our people out by clean-
liness, sobriety, civility, and hard work. They
are capital “ pays,” better than our people. Few,
if any, Greeks keep fruit-shops, which are almost
exclusively in the hands of Italians.—H. Wood-
ward, Sydney.
Contempt
for your ailments is simply committing suicide.
Every man is the centre of the universe to himself,
yet how many do we daily meet who complain of
weakness, liver complaint, neuralgia, and so on ?
Hundreds of such sufferers are met with every
week who neglect their cases when there is a
reliable remedy in Clements Tonic at hand. This
preparation is distinct from the many disguised
purgatives called indigestion cures, the use of
which are most harmful to the patient. Clements
Tonic does not give relief by drastic catharsis,
but aims at curing the cause of the disorder, and
then the unpleasant symptoms cease. If you
suffer, remember that without treatment the
diseasemust increase, andthatitis criminal on your
part to neglect your case. At any rate your life
depends on your getting proper treatment and
maybe the lives of a wife and family. Therefore,
do not delay, get Clements Tonic, and do not be
put off with vile purgatives or substitutes,
and you will meet with the same success as
Mrs. W. Wills, Clinton-lane, Goulburn, N.S.W.,
who writes on June 3rd, 1893: —I have been
troubled for the last three years with severe head-
aches, pains in the back, and shooting pains
throughout the whole system, complete loss of
appetite, and a languid feeling, and my eyesight
got so bad that I could not see to read even in the
day-time. About a month ago I had a severe
attack of influenza; I was so ill and nervous I
thought I would never get better. After various
remedies, which did me no good, I was persuaded
to try Clements Tonic. After taking one bottle I
was so much better, and my eyesight improved—
I could read without trouble—and after taking
two more bottles I feel better than I have felt for
years. I intend strongly recommending it to all
my friends. —Yours gratefully, W. Wills, Clinton-
lane, Goulburn, N.S.W.
N.S.W. Commandant Hutton’s up-to-date
suggestions for “ modernising and simplifying ”
cavalry tactics are singularly original. He says,
“The formation in two ranks must be at once
abandoned.” Wellington wrote the same thing
before Waterloo, and continued to insist on it till
the day of his death. The idea was put in practice
more than 35 years ago with the Indian native
cavalry. In fact, what Col. Hutton advocates is
the Indian system—stock, lock, and barrel - and it
would have been simpler to say so at once.
Edmund Yates’ will was proved at about
.£34,000 personalty. In his will he directed that
after his death his jugular vein should be opened,
and that the surgeon who did it should receive a
fee of 20 guineas. It is not known whether this
was done or not —but, probably not, as Charles
Yates, who carried his father to the Savoy, where
he died, was not likely to have had a copy of the
will about him. The World is to be run as here-
tofore, under the direction of trustees, for 21
years, and when the profits exceed .£4OOO a year
said trustees are to receive a handsome bonus.
Mrs. Yates has the income of the residuary estate
for life.
Ed. Bulletin, —A telegram from Coonam-
ble states the Nebea proprietors will insist on
shearing under the Pastoralists’ ’94 agreement,
even if the sheep are not shorn before Xmas. The
idiocy of this bluff is too apparent, as by the end
of September even a snake would be grass-seeded
on Nebea, whilst the prospect of facing the plains
summer, with sheep carrying 16 or 17 months’
wool, would coerce even Wingen Abbott to shear
under S.U. rules. —H.J.B.
Dear Bulletin, —Can’t you give us a
series of cockatoo stories? Here is one for a start.
I went into a small shop in Albert Park the other
day, and noticed a stately “ cookie ” trimming his
nails on the end of the counter. There was no
attendant in the shop and, after waiting for a few
moments, I knocked. The cockatoo regarded me
for a moment, like a benevolent old man looking
over his spectacles, and then said : “Ring the
bell, please.” “He’s quite as good as an as-
sistant,” said the woman who came to attend to
me. More retrenchment. — Silas Snell.
A touching little volume, with the title
“How to Blend Scotch Whisky,” has just come
before the public, and calls up many pleasant
reminiscences. Scotch whisky, admittedly the
finest in the world, mostly comes from cold and
savage regions in the Highlands with names like
Craigellachie, Lagavulin, and Laphroaig, which
strange and abusive-sounding epithets are the
designations of three of the most noted whisky-
mills in the world. Out of the brews prepared in
the unpronounceable places above-mentioned, the
favorite “White Horse” whisky is compounded
according to certain secret arts and incantations
known only to the sorcerer in charge. It is a
beautiful drink, and the only thing to be regretted
is that there is so little of it in existence. The
method of making it was originally discovered by
special revelation, and it is bottled as a sacred
function and corked as a species of holy rite.
It has to be drunk in a specially prepared
frame of mind in order to do justice to its excel-
lencies, and the feelings of the drinker as it goes
down, cannot be described in mere words.

Wool and Produce Reports.
M‘Burney, Wallis & Co. reportNo auction sales this
week, but next week a fair quantity of wool will be placed
upon the market. Rates ruling for all descriptions of
wool may be quoted on a par with last week’s sales.
Several foreign buyers have touched Australia’s shores at
Albany, en route for our capital, which will soon assume
its usual busy summer aspect, and be the scene of ani-
mated bidding for the clip of 1894-5. We believe our sale-
room will this time contain more buyers than any previous
season, all the manufacturing centres of the world being
represented. Owing to the rapid growth of our business,
we have been compelled to make storage provision apart
from our already extensive warehouses at Margaret street.
Our new store at Pyrmont, which we call our No. 3 store,
is fitted with all the most modern appliances for the
speedy and effective handling of wool. It has a well-
lighted sample floor, covering an extensive area, and
thus enabling us to place wool before buyers to the best
possible advantage. We propose holding all our auction
sales at Pyrmont this year, and take this opportunity of
thanking our supporters in the country who have rendered
this step necessary.
The New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Co.,
Ltd., report: Wool: The past few days have covered a
period of exceptional interest to all connected either
directly or indirectly with our great staple industry, for
it has witnessed the removal of the heavy duties hitherto
levied on wool imports in the United States. The nature
and extent of the recent changes in the United States
tariff are perhaps of less consequence to outside com-
merce, than the cessation of the element of uncertainty,
which has in this connection so long prevailed. Relieved
of the incubus of doubt as to the future fiscal policy of
the Great Republic of the West, manufacturers and
distributors will no longer lack a stable basis upon
which to conduct their operations, and the result
can hardly be otherwise than beneficial to our
main product, as a commodity. A'ready signs of
a revivifying current have been clearly visible in
the Sydney wool-sale room. Prices have hardened
slightly and the position of our market to-day warrant
the supposition that, as a consequence of recent political
events in America, the long-looked for improvement has
at length accomplished an entrance at a really vulnerable
point and that increased firmness will mark the course of
wool-values in Sydney during the current month. It is,
moreover, confidently anticipated that the adoption by
the U.S. Legislature of a more enlightened fiscal policy
will not only immensely aid the sound prosecution of
business all the world over but will, at an early date, re-
introduce into the Sydney wool-market, upon an appreci-
able scale, the competition of a large and enterprising
Sjpmrnunity.

THE WATERBURYS
RECENT TESTIMONY IN THEIR FAVOR.
CONVINCING STATEMENTS.
A. DOWDIN6 (Wentworth Falls) writes : “ I
have had a Waterbury watch for five years, and
have found it far superior toother watches in keep-
ing time. It has given me every satisfaction.”
F. HOWARD (Jerilderie): “I have used a
Waterbury watch for some time, and consider it as
good a timekeeper as a seven-guinea English lever,
which costs me nearly the price of a Waterbury to
C l ean |
GILBERT COLE (Mt. Manara, Ivanhoe):
“The Waterbury watch I purchased from you nearly
three years ago has given the utmost satisfaction.
I have subjected the watch to all kinds of rough
usage, and it has kept splendid time. I consider
the Waterbury the best watch procurable for
timekeeping purposes.”
W. MORRISON (Sutton Forest): “The
Waterbury has kept very good time since I got it,
eight or nine years ago. If I was ever going to
get a new watch, it would be a Waterbury.”
G. SMITH (Merri Merri, Coonamble): “ Hav-
ing bought one of your short-winding watches two
years ago, I am glad to inform you that it has
given me every satisfaction, and I have always
found it keep good time. I have had several silver
watches, but have not found any to equal the
short-winding Waterbury.”
ROBERT WALKER (Springs, Hillgrove): “ I
have had a Waterbury (Series J) watch in constant
use for over two years while working in deep mines,
where it has had very rough usage in dynamite,
•moke and dust. It has given every satisfaction.”
JAMES WALSH (Yerong Creek) ; “The
series J Waterbury watch has given me every
satisfaction. As I spend most of my time on
horseback, I can safely assert that I have given
the watch a fair trial during the last two years.”
J. KILPATRICK (Currabubula): “I have
been wearing a Waterbury watch for some years.
My work is of the very roughest kind—stock
riding, station work, etc., and the Waterbury gives
me every satisfaction. I can recommend it to
station and farm hands.”
WATERBURY WATCHES CAN BE SENT

deadhead hill, at Croxton, or North Fitzroy, Racecourse,
Melb., an obstructive tophamper of fencing has been put
up. The proprietary is luckier than the V.A.T.C., at Caul-
field. There the local authorities made them take down
the top-hamper. Meanwhile the V.B.C. bores ahead
steadily with its scheme of charging for admission to the
Flat.

It is quite possible that a contest between Jack-
son and Corbett would end in a draw, as it did when they
met Jbefore. Both are clever, long-range fighters, and
either, finding that he could not win, would make it im-
possible for the other to do so—by simply keeping out of
danger.
• • • •
Nothing can be more unnatural than the stand-
ing start of Australian racecourses. A horse, thoroughly
fed and wound up, and ridden by a jockey just as eager
and mindful of the fact that getting away well is half the
battle, is expected to toe a chalk-line and get off at a
given signal. The old English rule specifies that horses
must be started from a walk.

Editor Bulletin, — horsecouldn’t
have died (or lived, either) out of America. A weight of
27cwt. might pass—there was a Clydesdale shown in Mel-
bourne that topped 24cwt., but it’s no slouch of an ele-
phant that stands 9ft. 2iu. It would be quite the Yankee
ticket, though, to give erected-head-height as shoulder-
measurement. —Dromedary.

Dear Bulletin, —The atavism you mention as
exemplified in Abercorn’s reversion to the Stockwell type
is a noted fact also in human physiology, the professors
whereof call the phenomenon “ancestral prepotency.”
And this prepotency—be it noted by the sexual-equality
doctrinaires—is invariably that of a male ancestor.—

Large slices are now being cut off the salaries of

Boxing doesn’t seem to require half the stamina
of other sports. In nine cases out of ten a boy of 18 is
quite a match for a man ten years his senior, assuming
equal weights, and where do you find in rowing, cricket,
football, &c., in any but exceptional cases, that a man
distinguishes himself before 22 or 23 ?

Recent Melb. magisterial decisions make it
illegal to occupy and use a shop for betting purposes, but
leave street bookies free to follow their calling. Every
little lane off Bourke and Little Collins-street has its two

12 and 2 o’clock, on any race day, dozens of bookies lay
the odds openly on the footpath in Bourke-street itself.

Corporal Clarke, the alleged champion walker,
is anxious to make a match in Sydney if he can get leave
from his military duties at Albany. Clarke says he wants
to settle the doubts, one way or the other, as to whether
he walks fair heel-and-toe.
The success of the Japanese in the war
with China surprises no one who knows how fully
they have prepared themselves for hostilities. For
years they have been steadily arming and drilling,
with an eye to the contingency which has now
arrived. China, on the other band, in spite of her
vast preponderance of population, has a losing
chance ; simply because she has neglected to take
the most patent and obvious precaution to prevent
her armies from being decimated by sickness. It
speaks volumes for the capacity of the Japanese
leaders that they have grappled opportunity by
the forelock, and that no Japanese army ever goes
into conflict without an ample supply of Marshall’s
Tonic Nervine.
Now that the sale of drink is prohibited
in the Balclutha district of Maoriland, two nice*
looking young ladies travel round that region in
a buggy and do a roaring business. One of them
collects a shilling from you for a charitable pur-
pose, and the other one gives you a drink of
whisky for nothing.
Westminster Gazette alleges that Bishop
Reunion, of Adelaide, “ has seen a good deal
of rough work in the bush, for an Australian
Erelate’s work is not confined to the capital,” &o.
>r. Kennion has seen less of the bush than Gov.
Kintore, or Guy Boothby, the other two daring
explorers so much advertised in the London press.
The “rough work” is done by hard-up, stone-
broke parsons, receiving less pay than a labourer.
In Westralia the other day a Sydney man
met a foreigner who had wheeled a barrow con-
taining lewt. from the coast to a mining camp
210 miles distant. “ I congratulate you, my
friend you are a hero,” said the Sydneyite,
“ but don’t forget, next time you undertake such
a journey, to get a barrow with a bigger wheel—
it would travel so much easier.” “All very well,”
replied the foreigner, “but I had no choice. I did
shake dat barrow.”
During the year ended June the Salvation
Army, at their various institutions in Victoria,
supplied to the destitute, 84,498 beds and 323,803
meals. In N.S. Wales the totals were 22,844
beds and 69,120 meals; in Queensland, 15,017
beds and 59,803 meals ; and in S.A., 18,443 beds
and 53,881 meals. Which of the churches can
show an equal record of practical usefulness?
And the feeding and lodging of the homeless and
friendless and the neglected does not by any means
exhaust the good work done.
A M.L. paper contains a nice, consoling
interview with the local undertaker, in the course
of which the reporter is assured that the inter-
ment of live persons is an impossibility. In
another portion of the same issue appears a tele-
gram from Napier, stating that a typhoid patient,
who had died at the hospital, and had been
coffined and placed in the morgue, was subse-
quently found sitting bolt upright in his wooden
jacket—dead beyond all question this time. The
inference is that the supposed defunct had been
prepared for burial when alive, but that on coming
to his senses the horror of his surroundings finished
him off.
Romantic advt. from Auckland (M.L.)
Star :
WANTED to sell, a handsome bridal wreath and
” veil, never been worn. Apply, &c.
Poor little relic. Evidently some one bought it
for an auspicious occasion, and then the intended
bridegroom died, or levanted, or married some
other woman, or was found out before the cere-
mony, or else he went mad and was taken to a
lunatic-asylum, or he took to drink, or the bride’s
money vanished and he jilted her, or something
happened. And the broken-hearted bride has
evidently lost all hope of getting any one to re-
place him—which favors the idea that she has
lost her money, or else her hair has all come out—
so the ill-omened souvenir is for sale, cheap.
Auckland (M.L.), during its comparatively
brief civic history, has received many princely
bequests. Hori Grey gave a library and collection
of antiques which is insured for .£25,000 ; J. T.
MTCelvie, who made his pile trading with the
Maoris, presented to the city during his lifetime a
number of valuable pictures, and when he died
left £40,000 for an art-gallery ; “ Miser ” Costley,
who owned the freehold of about 40 pubs., be-
queathed £120,000 to the local charities ; there
have been bursaries galore for the local university;
and now a friend of The Bulletin’s, who has
seen the will, says that a wealthy wine and spirit
merchant will leave a quarter-of-a-million for
public purposes.
Dear Bulletin, —“Unt” (July 21) implies
that great muscular development denotes strength.
I believe this is a wrong, though commonly
accepted, theory. The strength of an animal
seems to reside in the bones and sinews only. The
strongest animals in proportion to their size, and
the strongest parts of the individual animals, are
more sinewy than muscular. The goat, cat,
kangaroo, and the wings of birds, for instances.
As far as I know, no powerful animal in a state of
nature has large muscles in proportion to its
strength, taking the Clydesdale horse as a standard.
Sinewy men are far stronger and more enduring
according to their weight than muscular men.
Large muscles are developed in some domestic
animals for the sake of appearance, and in others
for the value of the muscle as food. —P.H.
The member for Williamstown (Vic.) told his consti-
tuents the other day that “ Sir James Patterson has kind-
ness of heart and an earnest desire to discover the right
and safe line of action to take in order to lift Victoria out
of her present difficulties. He (the M. for W.) has seen
the tears coming down the Premier's cheeks in sympathy
for others’ troubles.” (Loud laughter.)
There was a brazen Premier, Jim Patterson by
name,
Whose one redeeming feature was a ’art;
He always double-shuffled, and he played the kind
of game
That passes, in Amurrika, for “smart.”
But when a tale of sorrow reached his sympathetic
ear
A bellows wasn’t in it with his sigh,
And, provided there were members of the Party
standing near,
Yer could see Jim steal ’is h’apron to ’is h’eye.
He swaggered round the country, gorging ban-
quets by the score
(He carried meek reporters in his train),
Exhorting all and sundry to be cheerful evermore.
Because he’d told the sun to shine again.
By chance he met a voter rather short of bread
and meat.
Who startled him with hunger’s bitter cry ;
He sang “Ha! ha! the uses of adversity are
sweet ”
But they saw Jim steal ’is h’apron to ’is h’eye.
His underlip protruded and his brow grew black
as ink
If scribblers called attention to his bluff ;
He didn’t care a curse for what his “ enemies ’*
might think,
And his answer to an argument was “ stuff !”
He couldn’t weep for Justice being trampled in
the dirt
By the friends of unconvicted felo-ny ;
But if he thought a banker’s tender feelings had
been hurt
Yer could see Jim steal ’is h’apron to ’is h’eye.

OTIOE UNDER REAL PROPERTY ACT.
APPLICATIONS having been made to biing the lands hereunder described under the provisions
of the Real Property Act, Certificates of Indefeasible Title will issue, unless Caveats be lodged in
Form B of the said Act, on or before the date named opposite each case respectively.
Diagrams delineating these lands may be inspected at the Land Titles Office, Elizabeth-street

There are but few bookmakers in S. A., the land
of the tote, and they recently hit upon a new device.
Mossy now poses on the racecourse as a “ commission-
agent.” He lakes the investor's ss. “ to put on the tote,”
which simply means that il the nag wins Mossy pays the
tote-div. The police were powerless to cope with this
idea until a nag paid a tote-div. of £39, and the “ com-
mission-agents ” refused to pay more than 10 to 1. Then
the show burst up.

Queensland Government, after a great struggle

not “register, transmit, or deliver” sweep-promoters’
letters after the end of this year, 1894. Where, then, will
“ Tattersall ” find rest for the sole of his foot ? Tasmania?
Westralia? It is the little word "transmit” that will do
the mischief. If N.S. Wales and Victoria refused to
“transmit,” instead of only to “deliver,” the big sweep
would be half-way up a tree already. Tatt. should go to
Noumea.

In a Yorkshire v. Derbyshire match Brown
played a ball smartly on to his wicket and still lived. It
passed between two stumps without bringing down the
bails, the oddest feature of the incident being the care-

noticing that there was a chance of a bail being bowled
clean through the wicket.

of the past. Her luck has been out. for a long time.
Also, she is under the painful necessity of paying a mar-
riage settlement of £3OOO to her youthful third husband.
He lias separated from his puffy benefactress, and now
that the horses have gone there is nothing left for the
poor old “sport ” but religion and a respectable end.

WOOLLAIIRA MUNICIPALITY—PETI-
TION FOR DIVISION OF.
HIS Excellency the Governor, with the ad vice
of the Executive Council, directs the pub-
lication, in accordance with the “ Municipalities
Act of 1867,” of the substance and prayer of a
Petition addressed to his Excellency, and signed
by 134 persons, who are alleged to represent at
least two-thirds of the electors of the proposed
Borough, praying separation from the Borough of
Woollahra, and erection into a distinct Munici-
pality under the name of the “Borough of
Vaucluse.” JAMES N. BRUNKER.
The Petitioners state that they represent at
least two-thirds of the electors resident or owning
rateable property within a certain portion of the
Borough of Woollahra, and pray that the area
hereinafter described may be separated from that
Borough, and be constituted a distinct Munici-
pality under the name of the Borough of Vaucluse,
for the following reasons —viz. : ,i
1. That the area of the present Borough is so
extensive in proportion to its population as to
render it a difficult one to govern satisfactorily.
2. That the area hereinafter described is so re-
mote from the centre of government and most
populous portion of Woollahra that it can only be
satisfactorily governed by the constitution now
prayed for, and that your Petitioners desire that
Municipal works may be carried out under local
supervision.
3. That the interests of the residents of the area
hereinafter described and of the remaining portion
of the said Borough of Woollahra are entirely
different, and that they form virtually separate
communities. .
4. That the expenditure of the Municipal funds
has not hitherto been to the satisfaction of the
ratepayers within the area now sought to be
divided. ■ . ~ . ,
5, That the population within the area herein-
after described comprises upwards of 1000 souls.
6. That the area hereinafter described contains
about seven hundred and seventy-eight (778) acres.
7. That the assessed value for the present Muni-
cipal vear of the property within the area herein-
after " described is upwards of nine thousand
pounds (J£9000). . ,
8. That the annual income derivable from the
assessed value of the property aforesaid at the
Municipal rate of one shilling (Is.) in the pound
(<£) is about six hundred pounds (.£600).
The boundaries of the proposed borough are as
follows Commencing at Tivoli Jetty, in Rose
Bay, in the County of Cumberland, and colony
aforesaid ; and bounded thence partly on the south
by the centre of Bay View Hill-road easterly to its
intersection with the Old South Head-road;
thence by the centre of the said Old South Head-
road north-easterly to the southern boundary of
reserve No. 26; thence by the said southern boun-
dary of said reserve No. 26 east to the Pacific
Ocean ; thence northerly to Inner South Head ;
and thence by the waters of Port Jackson
southerly, to the point of commencement.
And your Petitioners, as in duty bound, will

HOW TO TURN BACK THE CLOCK.
What time is it, Maggie?” said John, with an
Uneasy sense that he ought to be on his homeward
Way.
“I’ll go and look,” she answered. Stepping
quietly into the kitchen the girl pushed the clock
hands back an hour, and returning, said, “It’s
only half-past nine by our clock ; you can stay an
hour longer.”
So John stayed, for lovers are never eager to
part, and he needed no coaxing. The next morning,
however, he overslept himself, and Maggie’s
father, at his breakfast, having missed the train
he intended to journey by that day, wondered how
the good old clock could have lost an hour in the
night. Bub Maggie didn’t explain. She meant
to set it right again before going to bed, but forgot,
which shows once more what everybody should
remember —that we can set back the clock, but we
cannot set back the time.
All the same it is possible occasionally to regain
lost things. In a woman’s letter recently received,
I find this sentence : “ They tell me I look ten years
younger than I did." And if she felt as she
looked, she was, to all practical purposes, ten years
younger. For, although a clock face looks the
same, no matter what time it is, a human face
doesn’t. That changes with the condition of the
“works,” or the life behind it.
The letter goes on thus : “ In the spring of 1880
I felt weak and low. I had a bad taste in the
mouth, and a thick, slimy phlegm covered my
mouth and tongue. I was sick in a morning,
retching and vomiting a watery fluid. I had
great pain in the head and was very mazy, being
at times so bad I could hardly stand upon my
feet. After eating the simplest food I had dread-
ful pain in my chest, and a tightness across the
chest and sides. For hours together I have sab
before the fire rubbing my chest to try and get
relief. I had great pain in the left side and pal-
pitation of the heart, and could get but little sleep
at night on account of it.
“ Gradually I grew weaker and weaker until
I could scarcely walk about the house, and bub
for the necessity of attending to my family, I
should have been laid up. My life was a burden
and a misery to me, and I often wished myself
dead.
“ Sometimes better, and at other times worse;
this was my general condition for ten years., during
which long period of suffering I was treated by the
doctor, and took every kind of medicine I could
hear tell of, but got no better.
“In November, 1890, I read in a book of a
medicine called Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup,
and got a bottle from Mr. E. Banks, the chemist!
After I had taken a few doses I found my food
agreed with me better. I kept on with the Syrup
and gradually gained strength. I had become
so thin and emaciated through all those years of
suffering that it took time to fully restore me.
But I am noio in better health than I ever was in
my life, and my recovery has astonished my
friends. They tell me I look ten years younger
than I did before taking the Syrup. How I wish I
had known of it years sooner ! My husband and
friends had given up all hope of my getting
better, but none of us knew of Mother Seigel’s
Syrup.
“On mentioning to the Rev. E. Harries, the
Vicar of Christ Church, what had wrought the
cure, he said I should write and let the proprietors
know what the Syrup had done for me, so as to
benefit others. You may publish this statement
as you think proper, and I will gladlv answer
enquiries. Yours truly, (signed) (Mrs.) Elizabeth
Greenhalgh, 21, Rutland Street, Newtown, Pendle-
bury (near Manchester), May 14th, 1892.”
Thus was this good woman enabled—not to
turn back her nominal age, but what was better—
to recover the priceless treasure of health, without
which neither youth nor age has any comfort.
Her malady was the same wretched indigestion
and dyspepsia, the curse of all ages and nations.

When the young King of Servia made his
recent coup d’etat and suspended the constitution,
an “influential deputation” waited on him to
express the unanimous gratitude of the little wild-
cat kingdom. When the influential deputation
left, most of the royal forks and spoons were miss-

given orders to the police department for an out-

the occasion.
When We Parted
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Still the cattle through the pasture wander in the
long, warm days—
Still the mournful gum-trees rustle in the forest’s
ferney maze.
And the woodland scents and music, that will
haunt me till I die,
Bring me back the hour, long years since, when we
parted, you and I.
Maiden of the wind-swept pasture, grown to wife
and motherhood,
Leaving in the years behind you passion dimly
understood—
When you wedded, I could bear it, for the worst
was done before,
When I_ loved you—yes, and left you, and in
leaving loved you more ;
But I lacked the faith to keep you, faith in your
heart and my own ;
Left you, doubting, left and lost you—oh, my
love, had I but known !
For I know now that you loved me, held me false,
and gave your life,
Loveless, to another’s keeping, who could dare to
call you “ wife.”
And you live in peace and honour—never shall our
paths unite,
And you bear unto another children that were
mine by right.
Mine, if I had known my riches, kept the heart I
knew too late,
Then I had not wandered lonely by the cold, dark
seas of Fate !
Lonely, loveless—for the memory of your slighest
smile or sigh
Blots out all the world of women since we parted,
you and I,
“Never trust the love of women !” cried a voice
within my heart,
And I listened and I watched you, dreaming that
you played a part;
And our first long kiss at evening grew a
phantom by the morn,
And the words the pure stars taught us were the
brazen sunlight’s scorn ;
Though your arms around me clasped me to your
mouth of flower-like red,
And your fragrant hair blown round me as a rose’s
scent was shed,
And your white breast warmly beating, passion-
shaken for my sake—
Till your kisses conquered reason ! I could sleep
and never wake!
All the night looked pale with passion—all the
morrow cold with doubt,
And your voice was drowned in noises echoing
from the world without,
Till one morn came cold and jealous, froze my
heart and bade me fly—
Cursed, cruel voice that called me when we parted,
you and I!
Where the waving rushes whisper down beside
the stagnant creek,
We would watch the red sun setting on the distant
mountain peak,
And your face had caught the colour of the rose-
clouds in the west,
And your burning eyes were shadowed as you
veiled them on my breast.
Oh, twere better had I borne you over purple
hills afar,
To the seas that slumber never, out beyond the
evening star,
From the green Australian pastures to the won-
drous worlds of old.
To the paths of Fate’s directing, and the years
that should unfold,
Hair wherein the sun was woven ! pale lips burnt
to passion’s red !
Was my happy heart your pillow once, oh, jasmine-
scented head !
Once, and never more for ever—Fate’s unfathomed
waters lie
’Twixt my heart and you who loved me when we
parted, you and I!
Would that your white arms had bound me,
chained me always to your side,
That I might not turn and wander over deserts
waste and wide;
Had you known the word to stay me, known to
speak your inmost heart,
These lone hills and this dull river never could
have seen us part.
How should you have known my longing when
myself I did not know,
How should you have bid me linger when I bade
myself to go!
Darling, you were but a woman, slow to read
man’s changeful mind,
Knowing not your beauty’s power, nor its strength
to hold and bind,
And you took my sentence meekly, as the slave of
my desire.
Knowing not one word could quicken all my
smouldering heart to fire—
Had you chosen you had broken all my chains,
and set me free,
You had been my life for ever, heart and soul and
mind of me!
We had faced our fate together, welcoming its
good or ill,
Onward through the deep-green valley, onward to
the frozen hill,
Pilgrims from the dawn to sunset, led by Eros
golden-winged,
Passing through the gates of twilight where the
sun hangs golden-ringed,
Passing to the Night eternal, night unvexed of
dream or sound,
As a perfect flower will perish stamped and silent
in the ground ;
But Life’s tree will never blossom, nor his chalice
brim with wine,
Let the night endure for ever, if the day be mine
and thine !
But it is not, no, nor shall be-we shall die who
never lived,
Stronger is the love that holds us than the dim
faith half-believed,
Love is Life, and we have missed it, turned away
when he drew nigh,
Joy was offered for our taking—but we parted
you and I.
Now the sky grows grey above me, and the wheel-
ing curlew cries,
“ Love is not the good we dreamed of, Life is
fashioned out of lies.”
I have lost you, who so loved you, who shall love
you till I die
And forget at last that ever we were parted you
and I!

Treasurer Ward’s proposal that all life-insurance
societies doing business in Maoriland shall deposit
£50,000 with the Treasury, said deposit to bear 4 per
cent, interest, ought to be a wholesome knock to
one or two very small institutions, which will pro-
bably drop out rather than put up the deposit. The big
companies doing business in the province are the A.M. P.,
Colonial Mutual, National Mutual, Mutual of Vic-
toria, Equitable, Mutual Life of Australasia, and New
York Life, and though in their cases £50,000 is
a mere drop in the bucket, still it means that the funds
won’t all be invested in mortgages—which is something.
The yearning to plant out all the money in mortgages is a
bad feature in the Australian offices, especially as a heavy
land-tax comes steadily nearer. Said tax won’t make any
difference in the case of an ordinary mortgage with a 40
or 50 per cent, margin, but where the value of the
security has depreciated—as it must have done in many
cases—until it only about covers the advance, a land-tax
will mean a serious loss. Under these circumstances, if
the Australasian provinces could agree on a law whereby
every insurance society had to invest half its funds in 4
per cent. Government bonds, it might be a lot better for
insurers in the end.

The enormous expansion of the butter-export
trade is one of the few bright spots in the commercial
outlook. Britain imports annually butter to the value of
£12,000,000. In 1868, Australasia supplied £5OOO worth
of this, and the figures flickered upwards and downwards
until in '76 the whole Australasian supply was valued at
£45. It crawled upwards and downwards some more
until ’B6, when it stood at £548. A little later Victoria,
in pursuance of its protective policy, began to pay
bonuses on its butter and cheese exports, and the trade
expanded enormously in that province. The Austra-
lasian exports of butter to Great Britain in ’93 were worth
£861,000, being double those of '92; and the total Vic-
torian export of butter and cheese climbed up from
£43,000 in ’B7 to £1,000,000 in ’93. In ’94, judging from
present appearances, it will reach £1,250,000. When the
trade first began the boxes used for packing butter were
imported at a cost of ss. 3d. each, but the Vic. tariff
presently knocked out the import business, and the
packages are now made locally at a cost of Is. 4d.

James Ramsay, who has apparently struck a

and a son of the late J. G. Ramsay, M.L.C. He is well-

An interesting item is that the African Gold
Recovery Co., which works the MaoArthur-Forrest
cyanide patents in the Transvaal, is making a bold bid
for the prolongation of its patents by calmly proposing to
the Government of the South African Republic that the
process shall be made a Government monopoly for 20
years, subject to a small fixed charge to be paid to it. At
the present time the process, says the Mining and
Engineering Journal, is being assailed in many quarters,
where it is held that the MaoArthur-Forrest patents could
not be upheld in a court of law, and where an action for
infringement is being courted by the open use of the pro-
cess without a license from the Recovery Co. The Co. pro-
bably considers its claims to the patent rather doubtful, so
the transfer ol the process to Government will be welcome.
It would, however, reap another advantage, for the
patents, even if kept intact, have only seven more years
to run; considering everything, it is better to accept a
reduced income for 20 years than to continue with the
present return for, at the most, seven years. The proposi-
tion is that the Government shall take over the process
entirely, patent rights or no patent rights, as an ordinary
monopoly, charging 7J per cent, royalty on the gold pro-
duced by the process, and paying a certain fixed propor-
tion of this to the co. Of course the main reason alleged
by the co. for this change is that it will benefit the
mining industry. At present the charges are not fixed
at a proportion of the gold produced, so that large pro-
ducers pay a smaller proportion of their output, and the
smaller companies pay relatively higher. Under the new
proposition the proportion would be fixed all round, and
this is the benefit alleged by the co. to be derivable from
the change. The whole mining community is up in arms
against it, partly because it practically perpetuates the
patents, which are now generally considered shaky,
and partly because it opens up unpleasant prospects
of a tax which may be increased at any moment for
the purposes of raising extra public revenue. In the
latter direction the scheme is open to misuse which would
damage the mining industry most seriously. The pro-
spects of the scheme being adopted are very uncertain so
far. The co., as we have heretofore noted, recently began
a suit in the courts ol the South African Republic for
infringement of its patent. This suit has not yet come
to a hearing, though great preparations have been made
for the trial.

Some cyanide facts, extracted from a speech by
Trubshawe, a Glasgow chemist. Ten thousand tons of
16dwt. (assay) tailings treated by cyanide gave 80 per
cent., costing 15s. per ton. One-and-a-quarter tons of
pyrites gave 98 - 25 per cent, of assay value. Two-and-one-

Exclusive of amounts held by the Treasury,
paper money circulated in the U.S. to the extent of
£212,500,000 sterling in July, ’92—being an average of £3
ss. for every man, woman and child in the States. The
metallic money amounted to an even larger sum. As the
States Govt, stands pledged to ship silver dollars free of
charge to any citizen depositing lawful paper money for
same, the figures quoted show how very convenient a
domestic currency paper money does make. When the
Australasian State Bank comes along, backed by the
strength of the group, it will supply the people with a
packable, portable and payable currency of paper, and
will add strength to its own stability at the same
moment.

City Mutual Lute Assurance Society, Limited,
Head Office, intersection of Hunter, Bligh
and Castlereagh Streets.
Sydney, 31st July, 1891.
To Our Policy-holders.
Ladies and Gentlemen, —Some eighteen months
ago we issued a policy for ,£2OO on the life of a
stalwart young fellow, 32 years of age. He was
then in vigorous health, and one would have
thought him good for another 50 years. Some six
months ago he got a slight scratch on the hand,
which, being neglected, rapidly developed symp-
toms resembling blood-poisoning. The doctor
whom he then consulted strongly advised attention
to the matter, and suggested treatment in one of
the Sydney hospitals. The poor fellow had only
just been cut down in his wages, he had had sick-
ness in the house only a little while before, and,
like many another person similarly circumstanced,
he did not care to avail himself of hospital benefits
while unable to pay for them. The result was
that, through the lack of proper attention,
the case terminated fatally, and we paid the
£2OO to his widow. Speaking to her when
the claim was being settled, I remarked that if
she had advised me in time, the Society would have
procured for her husband admission into one of
the three large Sydney Hospitals—the Sydney,
St. Vincent’s or Prince Alfred —to all of which it
is a subscriber, and thus in all probability his life
might have been spared. It would have cost
possibly .£2O or £25, but it would have meant a
saving to the Society of £2OO. What it would
have meant to the assured himself, and what it
would have meant to his wife and children it is
unnecessary to dwell on.
It is as well that the willingness of the Society
to act, and act promptly in matters like this, should
be generally known. It is well within the province
of the scope of a life office to make every endeavor
to keep its members alive, and so far as the assured
themselves are concerned, there are doubtless very
few who would prefer “dying and realising” to
“living and paying.”
The proper course to adopt in cases where
hospital treatment is deemed essential is to at
once advise the nearest local agent of the
society. Failing that, to send or telegraph to
head office, getting the medical attendant to send
a confirmatory message. The case will then
receive the immediate attention of the chief
medical officer, Dr. A. Jarvie Hood and myself.
Special country cases, where it is undesirable or
impossible to remove the patient to Sydney for
treatment, will receive special consideration.
The amount expended by the society would
remain as a debit against the policy—without in-
terest —repayable when the policy matured.
We do not profess to provide medical attendance
for our policy-holders in cases of ordinary sickness,
but there are some special troubles from which no
one, not even the healthiest, is exempt, such as
typhoid, blood-poisoning, accidents, &c., &c., all
of them dangerous in the extreme, and all of them
calling for that special care and attention which
only a hospital can properly give. Itis these wewish
to provide against. It is not a wide estimate to say
that fully 10 per cent, of the deaths in a com-
munity, other than those arising from old age, are
due to the absence of proper medical attendance
and skilful nursing. From a careful revision of
our death claims for the past 10 years—small, as
they have undoubtedly been—l am confident that
out of £55,000 paid, fully £6OOO may fairly be
ascribed to the lack of proper attention at the
critical time.
It may happen, of course, that only a very few
policy-holders will require to avail themselves of
the society’s good offices—that will be a source of
congratulation rather than an occasion for dis-
appointment. In going a little outside the
ordinary groove of life-offices we are simply carry-
ing out our expressed determination to make the
City Mutual Life the leader in liberal and pro-
gressive reforms.
This action on our part will probably promote
criticism. We invite it.
It may be remembered that when we announced,
some 12 months ago, in every paper throughout
the colony, our intention to allow every member
who had paid up for three years, or over, a fully-
paid policy, equal to the whole of the premiums
paid up, with interest added, a storm of con-
troversy arose as to our ability to do so. We
have demonstrated beyond the possibility of
doubt, that it could be done with the most
absolute safety, and the leading actuaries of the
colonies and the old country now admit the
wisdom of the step. As to its popularity, happily
there can be no question.
You will, I am sure, be pleased to hear that
the Society is progressing most favourably. At
the end of the current year, the usual actuarial
investigation will be held and the bonuses for the
past 3 years declared. I anticipate, with con-
fidence, that the results will compare favorably
with those of the previous triennium, a most suc-
cessful one. It is the intention of the Directors
to issue Bonus Certificates annually hereafter.
The enclosed photo., of which I beg your
acceptance, is an interesting little souvenir of the
progress of the Society, and of its native city.
Yours faithfully,
GEO. CROWLEY.

Parsons Bros, and Co., of 17 to 23 Harbor-
street, Darling Harbor, Sydney, are rapidly creat-
ing one of the largest businesses in Australia. The
firm now employs 100 hands, and every week
convert 1000 sacks of oats into Oatmeal, Flaked
Oatmeal, and Rolled Oats of their special brands.
Their cleaning apparatus, kilns, and machinery
generally are of the most modern and improved
type, and have no superior in Australasia. They
make a specialty of the manufacture of Cocoa,
with the newest appliances; and of Chicory,
which is grown in N.S. Wales, and dried at the
firm’s Blayney Mills. A very heavy stock of
Cereals, including Pearl Barley, and of all kinds of
Eastern produce is kept always on hand. Parsons
Bros, and Co., also manufacture Table Jellies,
Patent Groat’s Coffee Essence, Peppers, Curries
Spices, Mixed Coffees, and Mustards, all of high
quality and in grades to suit consumers. The
growth of their business has recently been so
enormous that extensive additions to their mills
and warehouses have been a matter of compulsion.
The new premises have been, this week, handed
over by the contractor, and afford splendid
facilities for the prompt execution of orders.
Parson Bros, and Co. have, in particular, come
before the public as manufacturers of their famous
Flaked Oatmeal, the demand for which is
increasing at an unprecedented rate. In fact, it
is found that the Flaked Oatmeal is taking the
place of all other kinds of oat foods, and is
becoming, what its wonderful nourishing power
so well fits it to be, the staple foodof Australasians
everywhere.
Tales of the Riverine .
Brockuell’s Prodigal.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
A great deluge of thin light, a far-reach-
ing tentacle of the sun-blaze which would, an houi
or two hence, make life terrible, fell upon tin
plain. From the hut, almost cottage size, by the
squat box clump, two men, one carrying a carpet-
bag, walked slowly to the bank beneath which
rolled sullenly the Darling.
“ Six o’clock,” said the elder, a man of 55 or so,
grizzled in beard, but of white hair. “Six
o’clock, and the Pride ’ll be here at seven. Time
enough yet, Frank, to alter your mind. Will you
stay ? ”
The younger man, slight of build, and short in
stature, was apparently not more than 20 years
old judging from the freshness of cheek and ful-
ness of facial contour. But his eyes aged him.
There was a poignancy of bitter feeling in their
steady glance that spoke of an experience and a
sorrow to which youth should have been a stranger.
Young as he was, this man had looked into the
heart of things as closely as his education fitted
him to look. He had attempted the eternal
enigma of living, and, with the fierceness of his
years, had combated the truth which everyone
and everything seemed in conspiracy to preach—
that there is no solution to the riddle. To live,
and not to understand the significance of living,
is to some finely-fibred minds an acute torture, for
which there is no alleviation but work, and yet
again work. And to this son of the wilds —of the
immeasurable plains with their solitude which was
solitude in the immemorial past, and maddening
in their unstoried and legendless bareness—work
for his acute brain and flexible hand was impos-
sible. Work in which soul and body can unite,
that was to seek afar. And so he would not stay.
“No, father. I must go. I must find some-
thing to do—something beyond catching birds and
chopping steamer wood.”
“Did I ever ask you to chop or saw wood ?
When you have done so, have you not acted
against my wishes, because, you said, you did it
for exercise ?”
“ Yes, yes, that is true ! So far, I was unjust.
But, in the future, when you are unable to work,,
what is there for me to do to keep you by, save-
the wood-chopping, if I stop here ? ”
“By that time, there will be enough to keep us !
both. With the simple habits I have taught you
there is nothing a reasonable man, unfettered by
family ties, can desire, that he cannot supply
on two hundred a year. In another year or
two the capital sum I have earned will yield
you that in interest. When the time comes
for me to drop off you can live here, or where you
please on that.”
• “ The mere living is not the whole of life ”
“Oh,” said the father, with an accent of des-
pairing impatience, “ the woman—the woman I
You feel you can’t understand what life is without
the woman ! ”
“No, father, it is not the woman only. But
why argue as we’ve argued before to so little pur-
pose? There is no need to go over the whole
ground again, is there ? I wish to get into the
wide world and to measure myself with other
men. That is the long and short of it.”
“Very well, I have said ray last words. I
have lodged a hundred pounds with McCulloch’s,
in Melbourne. You can draw upon that, and
when it is gone you can either come back or ask
for more.
But the lad said, under his breath, “I shall
never come back, and I shall not ask for more !”
* • *
Over the stir of the flocks of wood-
swallows, and the canary parrots and cockatoo
parrots which come with middle spring-tide to the
fringes of cover box, sounds the beat and splash
of the old Pride’s stern-wheel. The men turn and
gaze in the direction whence the sound comes.
There is a vague, bluish ridge on the horizon
which marks a struggling mass of saltbush.
Above it hangs a grey smoke that might be low-
lying clouds, but is really from the Pride’s stack.
In the still air it lingers impassive while the boat
slides on, leaves it behind, and adds fresh streaks
and volumes of cloud to the vast loneliness.
“ You will write, Frank ?”
“ Yes —father !” And beneath his breath again
the young man murmured —“Just one letter, and
one letter only.”
The boat drew near, with her deeply-laden
barge, and slowed down. A stack of wood was
piled ready for her, and while she was shivering
under the shutting-off of steam, some of her deck-
hands had thrust out the gang-planks, preparatory
to taking in fuel. Skipper Dinwood leaned over
the half-door of the pilot-house, and cheerily sang
out his “ Good morning !”
“Morning, Mr. Dinwood. We guessed you’d
make us about seven, and here you are !” The
elder spoke, fumbling his beard nervously the
while.
“Yes, th’ ol’ Pride is a pretty good timekeeper.
An’ how’s this? —no birds for us this time ? Why,
you lazy chaps! And this is just the beginning
of the season.”
“ No—no birds, captain, but I’ve another pas-
senger. Frank here is going with you as far as
Wentworth, perhaps he’ll go the whole trip to
Eohuca, but he can please himself.”
There was that in the man’s face which sug-
gested a difference, if not a quarrel. And
Capt. Dinwood was quick to understand. He
swung himself down from the upper deck to the
lower, and then sprang on shore.
“Why, you don’t mean to say as you two’ve
quarrelled, ’ave you? I’m dashed sorry I’m
here!”
The younger stood mute. The elder said,
sharply : “No, not quarrelled, skipper—only the
younker wishes to see something o’ life !”
“Goin’ to play the prodigal? Well, now, ’tis
natural, p’r’ps, as young birds should fly young
feathers, but I’d be deuced sorry if there’s any-
thing wrong between you. So you’re going to
Melbourne, Frankie? Well, take care and steer
clear of the gals, that’s what I say. Them’s the
snags; eh, Brocknell?”
The elder man, however, would not jest, and
turned to help a rouseabout with an unusually
large log. And the younger did not feel called
upon to answer, but, lifting his carpet-bag, threw
it on the deck and then turned to say his farewell.
He swept the boundless plains with their blue
and grey, and their red-hot hazes. He glanced
at the squat box clumps, and at the patches of
salt-bush, and his face worked with convulsive
tremors as he reflected he would never know
again, as he had known it in the past, the new
spring that alights from the car of Time for the
briefest of visits to the expanses of Droughtland.
Then Droughtland is not the land of the accursed
and the forgotten, but is covered, for a space, with
bush-green verdure that lives long in the memory
after the first hot wind of the same year’s
summer has drunk its sap and withered it. And
Frank Brocknell, like all who have once witnessed
the evanescent Darling spring-tide, yearned after
it, now that it had gone by for ever with him—

hungered for it. He thrust his hand down on his
heart, as though he were pondering once more
the oft-decided question, “ Should he go ?”
“ Aboard, aboard !” And, though there was no
need for it, skipper Dinwood sent the great
whistle shrieking into the silence as though to
arouse scores of hypothetical passengers.
The one passenger moved on board as if he had
not heard it. Brocknell, the elder, looking greyer
than ever, followed, and, while the men stood by
to draw in the gang-plank, exchanged a last hand-
shake.
“Write Frank, whatever happens. Write. I
am your only tie ; write to me if you wish to form
others, or if you don’t Good-bye !”
He jumped off, and with a wave of the hand
towards the pilot-house, passed hurriedly towards
the hut.
And, till the bends hid the hut, the younger
kept his eves upon it. As for the others in the
boat, they had set their attention on business,
and if there had been a moment’s thought given to
the enquiry, why younker Brocknell was leaving
dad Brocknell ?it was but for a moment. River-
side partings, never to be made up again this side
of the grave, were common enough. Skipper
Dinwood alone troubled himself over the matter,
and not without reason. Eighteen years before
he had induced the Brocknell father, with
his baby son, to settle at this Darling corner;
and he only knew, beside the father, why the
suggestion was one of the wisest that could be
followed.
It was not till the midday dinner-hour that the
skipper had a chance of speaking to young Brook-
nell. A tarpaulin had been slung for’ard on a
plane with the hurricane-deck, and under its
shade Cap’n Dinwood sat down to the meal of
stewed tea and tinned salmon, with a few precious
fresh potatoes. He called the boy.
“No ceremony wi’ you—with prodigal sons,
Frankie, so we didn’t put a cloth down aft. You’ll
bite in wi’me, ol’chap?”
The young fellow looked at the unappetising
mess and shook his head. “No, thanks, Mr.
Dinwood ; I don’t care for anything.”
“ Had yer breakfast this morning?”
“ Yes; half-past five.”
“ Did you eat anything? ”
“Yes—a bit of a toasted pigeon quail.”
“Oh, oh, that’s the reason you don’t care for
tinned fish, and tea that isn’t ’alf as good as post
an’ rails. Lord, you are a swell! Toasted pigeon
at five in the morning 1 ”
“No,” Brocknell tried to smile, “ that’s not it
at all. It’s—oh, you know just what is wrong,
Except to the township I’ve been nowhere, and
this is my first show.”
“No, that's what isn’t the matter! I’ve seen
other chaps a-leavin’ their ’omes, an’, let me tell
you, Frank, that was all the ’ome you ever had,
an’—an’ ’’
“ And what?”
“ P’r’ps, what was a dashed sight .better ’n you
deserve, if what I suspect is true,”
“ Suspect—what do you suspect ? ”
“ That you’re leaving the old man when he
wants you to stay ”
The young man rose from the bale of wool on
which he was seated.
“lam your passenger, Mr. Dinwood,” he said
with a tone of natural hauteur.
Dinwood looked up and laughed. “Come in
out of the blazing sun, you young fool. You’re
my passenger, but, by Jupiter, I’m the only
friend you have in the wide world save your
father, and as such I’ve a right to say to you what
I choose.”
“ Neither you nor him shall say a word to me
henceforth.” Frank spoke with a bitterness
that surprised himself no less than the skipper,
who repeated the words slowly as though he was
obliged to take in their significance by instal-
raents.
“ Neither—you—or—’im ! Neither—you—or—
’im ! Good God ! ’Ear ’im ! ” Then, thrusting
out an arm of brown hairy iron, he clutched young
Frank’s shoulder where he stood, and with severity
upon his usually genial face, pushed him before
him into the after cabin. Such of the crew who
saw the encounter wondered at its cause, and
more than one would have stood the dock of a
week’s pay to glean a rational explanation of “ the
skipper’s being in such a stew.” They could learn
nothing, however, through the closed cabin-door,

Wl th excitement in visage and demeanor,
. ‘^? fc me out! ” demanded the younger. “What

Neither you or im. Say that again, you
y° un S lrn P’ an 1 « break every bone in your spoilt
carcase. Do you know who e is as you speak of
that im?’ He waited for a reply, but none came,
£ ra " k was gathering his strength for a rush to
the door. Dinwood went on.
“Neither—you—or—’im ! I ask, d’you know
who ’e is, an’ what Vs done for you ? Who is ’e
who’s kept you ’ere from ’arm’s way all these
years, an’ yet given you the education of a gentle-
nian by himself? Who’s cut cords and poled
stinking cattle from the lagoons to get their hides
to make a decent bank-figger for you? Who’as
gone an’ I’arnt the ways of all th’ river-birds,
from the hen to the wood-duck, an’ the pigeon-
quail to the native-companion, an’ from the
salt-bush canaries to th’ eagle-hawk, an’ ’as
given you a fortune thereby? Who ’as I’arnt
you the ways of ev’ry man an’ beast an’ bird,
ev’ry tree an’ ev’ry cloud on the Darlm’?
Who ’as larnt you when the rivers come down an’
the winds, and shown you, with your natural nous,
bow you could just coin gold out of your larnin ?
Who’s ’im, I say ? By the Lord, if you don’t say,
shake the life out o’ you 1”
Not much of this scream of abuse—it was
little else—fell upon young Frank’s consciousness,
which was vacantly interrogating life, as though
he should ask it—ls this what I am to expect from
the world ? If so, had I not better go back to the
hut by the stunted box? But, heedless of the
young man’s pain and confusion, the skipper pur-
sued the rough path of objurgation.
“ Who ’as slaved for you, but ’im—a gentleman
born an’ educated? Who left the city, afraid you
should ’ear anything, an’ came ’ere an’ lived the
life of a savage all for you ? To protect you, an’
give ’imself for you, an’ now for you to give ’im
the go-by !”
The storm of words, passing in its first violence,
had clarified the youth’s atmosphere. He fol-
lowed the skipper resentfully, then wonderingly.
“ What do you mean ?” he at last managed to
say, abandoning, for the instant, his attempt to
leave the cabin.
“Do you know, young fool, that you’re a
mur .” He paused, as though now it was too
late he would have choked his utterance,
The lad bent over the narrow table, and with
strained voice completed the sentence,
“ A murderer’s son ! Why not say it, Mr.
Dinwood ? It seems you know, too, then ?”
“Yea.” blurted Dinwood, “But, though I
spokel didn’t think you did know. Did Aetellyou?’’
The tense lines of the young man’s face grew
more tense. “No,” he answered, “he did not
tell me, but I have known some time. I learnt
from this.” From an envelope in his breast-
pocket he drew a fragment of newspaper which he
handed to the boat skipper.
The latter took the slip, and ejaculating,
“Argus —it looks like Argus type,” read
thereon ;
. . . we had parted with this denizen of the bush,
and the boat was once more making her way down stream.
Conversation naturally turned upon the curious per-
sonality we had thus encountered. Confidences we
gleaned then would be respected if it were thought these
pages would ever meet his eyes, but, as that is most
unlikely, it will do no harm to say here that he was the
central figure, some 18 or 20 years ago, of a terrible
tragedy, which involved the loss of two lives
now spends his existence far from the haunts of men as
though he. . . . were not the hunter of feathered
things, but the hunted of men.
“ What’s all this,” questioned Dinwood.
“ Where did you get this ?”
“ It is, I think, part of an Argus review of a
book of travels. Some years ago, it must have
been, some traveller must have gone up and down
the Murray, and noting down what he saw and
heard, heard something said about him and put it
in his book. And the paper came with a parcel to
us, and I read it, though he did not.”
“ Why did you not give it to .”
“ Because whatever he had done it was plain he
did not wish me to know.”
“It—was—plain—he—did not wish —you to
know ! That’s it, is it ? An’ is what you know
and what he doesn’t know you know—is that the
reason why you are leaving him ?”
“ Yes !” At bay the boy turned defiantly. He
sought now neither to hide from himself nor the
Captain the knowledge of his intent on leaving
home. Not so much to gain new love of life as to
leave him whom he had come to loathe, because of
that secret crime which had compelled him to
thus tent in the wilderness —this was his aim, and
he revealed it.
“ Do you mean, Frankie ” —the skipper thrust
the door open, it was stifling inside now, and this
new surge of unwonted emotion seemed to strangle
him—“ that you are leaving your father ” —curious
how he stressed upon that word—“ because you
suspect ’im of a crime .”
“ Of a murder.”
“ You don’t know anything except from this ?”
“No ! I had no one to ask. I often thought of
asking you, but —but the matter was ours —his
and mine.”
“ Fool! you young, proud fool! What d’you
think he, your father, came up north for ?”
“To get where he was not known.”
“ But you see that he was known—someone
must have known to have told this scribbler cove.
Now, I knew—knew all from the first, and,
p’r’ps, I did tell a newspaper chap or two as I’d
never thought of using it again about the old
man’s goodness.”
It was now Frank’s turn to ask what the other
meant.
“ His goodness ! Fool, double-rotten fool —that
man’s not a murderer any more than he is your
father——”
“ What—not my father ? ”
“ Not your father ! It was your father who was
the murderer. If you ever go to Melbourne you’ll
find the odd story out easy enough, I’ll warrant;
never no kiddin’ o’ them yarns—they called it
‘The Great Brocknell Horror.’ I rec’lect well
how lads shouted in the streets 1 ”
And against the jamb of the doorway the lad-
leant, his deep eyes turned full upon the water-
scarred bank, but seeing nothing—only, as though
placarded on the luminous haze, “ The Great
Brocknell Horror.” Not his father, either?
What, what was the meaning of it all ?
# * *
Din wood pushed towards the pilot-house.
In this rude emergence of passion from the even
sailing of his days he had overlooked his mate’s
dinner-hour. He relieved the man at the wheel,
and Frank followed him with the old look on his
features strangely deepened. But a few hours
from the only home he had ever known, and yet
how Fate was dealing him sundry sufferings !
“ I must know more, Mr. Dinwood ! ” he said.
“You said he up yonder at the hut was not my
father, and yet that my father is a murderer ?”
Dinwood eased the wheel and fumbled the
spokes before he answered. In his rage it seemed
so slight a thing to tell the truth to the young man
when the truth was needed to justify his old-time
friend. But up here ’twas a different thing, with
the eyes of the lad staring him down.
Not inexpert at analysis, his introspectiveness
fostered by the solitudes of the bush, the young
man’s mind was probing the difficulty, and, as
Dinwood hesitated, he pursued him with leading
questions.
“ What was the murder? Of whom, by whom ?”
After a pause, Dinwood quavered : “Of your
mother, by your father!”
“God !”
« * •
Then Dinwood, with a panic rush of feel-
ing hastened, the darker having been revealed, to
show the brighter side.
“ An’ the ol’ chap up there is your father’s
brother, an’ he brought you ’ere to train you so
that you should never know. He gave up his life
to you, Frankie. He could not go ’ome, for he
would have died at ’ome, he was consumptive, an’
as he an’ me were old chums on the diggin’s, he
told me what he intended doing for you, an’ so I
said he should come ’ere. He would not change
’is name though—not even to save you.”
“He gave up his life to you!” The words
made so much clear to young Frank—so much of
the “ father’s ” inscrutableness, of what he
now recognised as patience with the youthful
tempers, of what he now knew to be wisdom.
The tide of thought so swept him that he could
not think, but an idea came afterward —to go
back.
* * *
And insisting, the boat’s course was
stopped, and Bracknell's Frank was put on shore.
Sixty miles then as the river ran. It should not
be an impossible task to cover the distance carry-
ing a water-bag.
But, when a month later, the Pride, on a down-
trip, whistled up Brocknell, and Dinwood hailed
the hut, he was startled to learn that the “Pro-
digal ” had not returned.
Nor did he ever return. The ants and the crows,
of things living, could alone explain why.

“Every man can write at least one
book,” every man with brains has at
least one good story to tell; every man
with or without brains moves in a differ-
ent circle and knows things unknown to
any other man. Write carefully and
plainly on one side of the paper only,
obliterating every unnecessary word ;
then mail your work to The Bulletin,
which pays for accepted matter. In
certain of the so-called prize-competi-
tions the great prizes fall to the news-
paper-proprietor, who gets the guileless
public to work for him for nothing.
Short stories, or ballards, especially on
bush, mining, sporting, social, or dra-
matic themes, are preferred by The
Bulletin ; 1360 words go to a column.
If you can possibly keep your story with-
in a column all the better. Don’t write
a column on any subject if a half-column
will do ; don’t write half-a-column where
a mere paragraph is enough. “Boil it
down.”
