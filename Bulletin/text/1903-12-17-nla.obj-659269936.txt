!•“Ask for His Majesty (crawl), and be sure that
you get it. Beware of spurious imitations.
See that the name is BLOWN IN THE
BOTTLE, and smell the cork,
OURSELVES.
We desire to emphasise the fact that HIS
Majesty (crawl) is a journal for Society, NOT a
society journal. His Majesty (crawl) is written
by Society for Society. It will discuss in a
refined way the affairs of the very best people.
Only the very smartest dames will be pictured in

expect notice from His Majesty (crawl) unless
he or she (a) is pure merino, dyed in the wool, or
(b) was educated at Eton, or (c) has an ancestor
who came over with Governor Phillip, or (d) can
pay handsomely for the privilege.

readers may have noticed the appearance of

vinced, commend itself to our patrons. It is
unfortunately true that Society in Australia is
under many disadvantages. The vulgarity and
lack of refinement inevitable
in a democracy are painfully
perceptible. In these cir-
cumstances, ' the eyes of
Society turn naturally to
the dear old Mother-Coun-
try. If we cannot be Eng-
lish, we should at least be
as English as we oan. It is
this consideration that has
prompted the choice of our
motto. In England, every-
body crawls. The lower
classes crawl before the
middle classes, who crawl
before the upper classes,
who crawl before the Aris-
tocracy, who crawl before
His Majesty (crawl). His
Majesty will crawl only to
those who can pay hand-
somely for the privilege.
“Nowit doth clearly ap-
pear that by the virtue of
birth and by that of itself
the Monarch is set apart
from all other men, there
being in His nature a divine
quality that can by no act of
Himself or others be divested, and that setteth
Him far above the conception of the vulgar. And
so true is this that it may be perceived in the very
least jot and tittle of the Monarch his deeds and ap-
purtenances. For even those bodily secretions that
are in common men called ignoble become in the
Monarch of amazing purity and brilliance,
as it is testified by many witnesses of the
greatest credit that have formerly served in the
precincts of the Court. And for myself I can
conceive of no greater honour, rior any gift more
■worthy of esteem, than that the spittle of the
Monarch should fall upon me, as I may write for
an example of the argument. For that indeed
would be a true consecration to His service, as an
anointing with the holy oil is a consecration to
the service of the Almighty.”—-Lord Herbies op
Barhabnook.
IN SMART SOCIETY.
We are all longing for the arrival of His Excel-
lency Lord Northcote, The need of a suitable
personage to crawl to is keenly felt in the very
nicest circles.
The engagement of Mr. Algernon Jonese-
Robinsone (“Algy”) to Miss Clara Victoria
Browne-Smythe has caused quite a flutter in
smart society. A formal announcement has been
pasted on the gate of Government House.
Following the latest smart custom, the names of
bride and groom will be united on marriage, and
cards will be issued in the title of Mr. and
Mrs. Jonese-hyphen-Browne-hyphen-Robinsone-
hyphen-Smythe. A portrait of Miss Browne-
Smythe will be found among our illustrations.
We regret to be compelled to draw attention to
the vulgarian habit of omitting the final e when
addressing persons prominent in smart Society.
The e is always added by the very nicest people.
We notice in an exchange a list of some of the
pleasant diminutives used in English smart So-
ciety. Twe-est means dearest; n.y twee, my
dear; diskee, disgusting; fittums, fits; Man-
Man, a Royal person.; deevie, delightful; expie,
expensive. We should be glad to see these words
adopted by Australian smart Society.
A correspondent complains of being annoyed,
HIS MAJESTY.
while promenading in her groundsatDarlingPoint,
by hearing in the street the vulgar noises of
tradespeople and hawkers. She suggests that a
smart suburb should be considered as a select
park, and that no person should be admitted to

the streets unless provided with a white ticket
issued by a committee of the nicest people. We
cordially approve the suggestion.
OUR ILLUSTRATIONS.
We have pleasure in referring to the unsur-
passed illustrations of smart Society which adorn
this number. The reproduction has been per-
mitted oniy to His Majesty (crawl). The por-
trait of Miss Browne-Smythe in the new smart
coat admirably exhibits her quite unique style of
beauty. Many good judges affirm that the lady
whose portrait we give as a type of Melbourne
beauty is undoubtedly the belle of Toorak.
The illustrations of His Excellency Lord North-
cote’s winning- personality have never before been
published. We expect that they will be framed

in the mansions of many of our best and nicest
people. These illustrations have been procured
only with very great trouble and expense, but His
Majesty (crawl) will count no trouble or expense
too great to be met in the endeavour to make this
journal trulyrepresentative of Australian smart
Society. Cmoe more we ask our patrons to
remember that His Majesty (crawl) is the only
genuine Society chronicle; to be careful when
purchasing to see that the name is blown in the
bottle, not merely printed on the capsule or label;
and, for greater precaution, to SMELL THE
CORK.

THE BED PAGE.
The annual exhibition by N.S.W. Photographic
Society, held last week at Vickery’s Chambers, was the
most important and interesting yet made. More than 400
photographs were shown, in seven or eight classes—por-
trait, landscape, genre and other, open to members or
open to the world ; and they were hung higgledy-piggledy
and catalogued indiscriminately, without reference to
classification. They were well hung, of course ; but the
Society should certainly hang its classes together, and
keep them distinct in the catalogue.
Exhibits came from France, England, America, Africa,
and Maoriland, as well as from Australia. Nothing like
the display, particularly in manipulated photographs,
has been seen in this country before. It was an admirable
lesson for students—and for professional photographers.
Photographers are now divided into two main camps—
the “ straight” and the “fake.” The “straight" man
depends upon his talent in selecting or grouping and his
skill in making a good negative; and for the rest he
prints fairly and gets the best tone he can. What you
see is essentially what the lens saw, though the com-
position may be bettered by the softening of detail, and
colour-sense may be considered and gratified.
The “fake” photographer considers the photograph
merely as so much raw material, which it is his business
to improve artistically with brush or pencil in order to
get a result more in conformity with a painter’s taste.
Re-touching, of course, is the beginning of “ fake ” pho-
tography ; and once you begin there is no reason why
you should stop. The misfortune of some of the “fakers,”
however, is to leave the limitations of the camera without
reaching the sphere of art. T' y are neither fish nor
flesh, and instead of making good photographs they
make bad pictures. Those who succeed are usually
painters, with a painter’s technical knowledge; and
they simply use the photograph as an outline to be filled
in as they would fill in a sketch.
In America, the debate of the two schools has pro-
ceeded with reference to artistic “ morals.” The
“ straight ” photographer who modifies his picture,
coaxing up a sky or throwing down a background,
complains that absolute alteration of the natural image
is not “ right.” But here, as elsewhere, final effect is
the onlj r criterion of judgment. If the end is good, then
the process is good.
The leading method of the “fake ” photographer is the
gum-bichromate process. The negative is taken in the
ordinary way. Then the printing paper is spread with a
mixture of . gum arabic, potassium bichromate, and
almost any water-colour pigment. When the coating is
dry, the paper is exposed to light through the negative.
The gum is rendered insoluble in proportion to the
amount of light which gets through the negative ; then
washing in water removes the gum according to
the degree of its solubility, and with the gum
the pigment. If the print is exposed long enough, you
get practically a straight photograph. But if you under-
expose the print, so as to get an outline, or little more,
you can set to work with a brush and alter tones, paint
out details, and even paint in details—such as clouds—
which are not shown in the negative at all.
The N.S.W. exhibition included excellent examples of
both kinds of photography—some of them world-
famous. Edward Steichen’s (Paris) Portrait of Rodm
was hung, and the hardly less celebrated Judgment of
Paris. The latter, at all events, did not rise to its price
or its reputation. Another leading exhibitor was David
Blount (England), whose picture of The Kitten gained
the Society’s gold medal. This represents a girl, stiff
and unsmiling, holding a kitten above her at arm’s
length. The composition and tone are admirable;
but the treatment is none the less false. There is no
natural joy, no vivacity, in either girl or kitten ; and, as
a wall decoration, the girl’s strained pose would strain the
nerves of anybody who should live with her. Not pose, but
repose, is the desideratum in a picture or a photograph ;
that is, it should not merely decorate a space, but should
“do you good,” tune you to life and living. The same
artist was given the medal for a landscape, and
his series of landscapes was technically excellent.
Yet J. Kauffmann, of South Australia, was doubtfully
inferior in Amidst the Pines— ox J. R. Wood, Newcastle,
in The Church and A Streak of Sunshine.
Good work, in an artistic way, was shown by A.
H. Kingsborough (S.A.); J. Temple Stephens (Mel-
bourne) ; and E. 0. Joshua (Melbourne). Very good work,
in a photographic way, was shown by more others than
there is space to name or criticise.
The N.S.W. Photographic Society and its officers are
certainly to be thanked for the intelligent pains they
have taken in arranging an exhibition of such high edu-
cational value.
A. H. Davis and E. A. Murphy are collaborat-
ing as author and illustrator in Steele Rudd’s Magazine
to be issued in Brisbane next week at sixpence.
A Melb. enthusiast sends copies of Christmas
cards, with the comment that they are “ designed by
Ida Rentoul, who is 16 years of age, and has had no art
instruction... Depend upon it, she will one day become
famous ; for you can no more hem in genius than you
can stem Niagara,” etc. The designs do not justify
the eulogium and the fuss. They consist of decorative
figures and landscapes, essentially thin and imitative, in
the familiar Christmas-book styie of fairy-tale illustra-
tors. The best that can be said about them is that
they show cleverness and promise in “an untrained
girl of sixteen.”
A first dividend of 11s. fid. per share has been
declared on behalf of sixty-four shares in The Bulletin
Story-Book, and is now payable. Contributors are re-
quested to send their present addresses to this office. The
Story-Book has not proved quite so good an investment
as the Reciter, for the reasons that it was a much more
costly book to print, and that until recently it has been
sold at a lesser price.

Stiff or Swollen Joints CURED!
Painful Sprains or Aches of the Arms,
Legs, or Body, Backache, Sciatica,
Rheumatism, Lumbago, &c.
r INHERE is no class of Disease in which Treatment by Electricity
has achieved more marked success than the various affections above
described. Whether they are acute or chronic, Electricity is alike
efficacious in effecting not only relief from pain, but a permanent cure. We
have had cases where the patient could not walk, but after a couple of
days’ application of the Belt and Attachments to the weak parts they were
walking about as well as ever. Other cases, we have had under treatment,
have been using Lotions, Ointment, and Drugs for years but without
relief, who have been positively restored by us within a week or two.
There are innumerable cases of Stiffened Joints, painful and enlarged as
the result of Chronic Rheumatism. This is exceedingly common among

the aged. How many are there whose declining years from fifty upwards . , , ~ ~
are rendered miserable by affections of the joints? Some cannot walk without pain and inconvenience, because their knees and ankles are the
seat of this most obstinate disease. Others can make little or no use of their hands and fingers, and the most disheartening thing to those afflicted
is the utter failure of drugs to effect relief. Marvellous results have been obtained by
Dr. McLaughlin’s Electric Belt
With Free
Attachments
and Electricity is recognised by the leading psychologists of the old worid as the only true Remedy for Diseases of this nature. One of the most
brilliant men of the day recently remarked before the Members of the Psychological Institute of Pans that Electricity will bring about a thera_
peutic revolution, and that its effect on Skin Diseases and all Functional and Nervous Disorders was most powerful. Take Sound Advice ! If
you are afflicted call or send for our Advice, and If you can’t be cured by Electricity nothing will cure you 11

CARARA, CURLEWIS, N.S.W.
Dear Sira,—l am very thankful for the
good your Belt has done for me. After
about three weeks use I have not a pain
about me, or the slightest sign of
diarrhoea. I have not taken one dose of
medicine since I have been using the
Belt, and I consider I am as well as ever
1 was in my life.
Yours truly,
DUNCAN McLEOD.
Florence-street, PORT PIRIE, S.A.
Dear Sirs,—l am pleased to be able to say that the
Belt continues to work to full satisfaction, and
gives no trouble. As regards health It has im-
proved me wonderfully, I have not had the
slightest sign of any pain across my back, as I
did beft re wearing the Belt. Now that I have the
Belt, I would not be without it for a small fortune.
Thanking you for putting such a cure in my way,
I am, yours truly,
A. 0. GORMAN.
EUCHAREENA, N.S.W.
Dear Sirs,—l have been using: your High-
grade Belt, according to directions, during the
last four weeks, and the first application com-
pletely banished, as if by magic, all the musoular
twltchings from my legs, I also feel a vast im-
provement in my back, and, In fact, I feel better
and stronger ail over. I have done more work
during the last three weeks than for months past.
Yours gratefully,
CEORIE CARTER.

SOUTH YARRA, VIC.
Dear Sirs,—l am glad to tell you that
my troubles have left me, and I haven’t
felt batter for years. My chief trouble
was stricture—arid bad at that, also
sciatica, and my back was very bad.
Constipation has been a thing of the
past since wearing your bait, and I have
put on over a stone in weight.
Yours truly, A. D. GRANT.

Ayer’s
Cherry Pectoral
soothes irritable throats, heals inflamed
bronchial tubes, and quiets congestion
in the lungs. This is why it so quickly
controls these old coughs and pre-
vents pneumonia and consumption.
“I was troubled with a very hard
cough which I could not get rid of.
When I read of Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral
I sent to Johannesburg and procured
a bottle. It completely cured me, and I
have many comrades here who have had
hard coughs cured in the same way. ”

Wore a Torture
BELT.
SUFFERED TERRIBLE AGONY.
From wearing an Electric Belt
charged by the use of
SULPHURIG TIG ID.
Mr. W. Folley, Alfred Woollen Mills,
Williamstown, Vic., writing to the Dr.
McLaughlin Electric Belt Co., tells how he
was scarred and burned by the use of a
Free Belt , which he had erroneously
been led to believe was as good as theirs.
He paid £\ for the Free Belt because
he had been convinced that by paying
this cash price he was obtaining a similar
appliance to Dr. McLaughlin’s Famous
rejuvenator which has gained Wordd
Wide fame as a Curative Agent. It goes
to show how misleading are advertise-
ments which seem to offer something for
nothing.
Gentlemen —In answer to your kind in-
quiries after my health, I beg to state that
I have been completely cured of the Scia-
tica that has troubled me for years. I
cannot thank you enough for your gentle-
manly treatment and fair dealing with your
patients, as I know from others that their
treatment has been the same as mine.
I may just as well let you know my ex-
perience in seeking a cure for my trouble
before I purchased one of your High Grade
Belts. I had been under doctors and re-
ceived scant relief; and also tried various
quacks, but it was all the same. I then
placed myself in the hands of a Specialist
(in Melbourne) guaranteed to cure Rheu-
matism and Sciatica, but received very
small benefit from the treatment. I then
had mv attention drawn to Electricity.
Well, 1 thought, “ Never venture, never
win,” so I PROCURED first of all a Belt
for £i and was very much disappointed
because I was informed that it was neces-
sary to take a long and exceedingly ex-
pensive course of drug treatment. I would
not do this and then I wrote for, and ob-
tained a so-called Free Belt , with a
most “ Wonderful Pedigree,” at a cost of
£\. I wore the Belt according to the in-
structions given faithfully for a period of
five weeks, and by that time I was Burnt
and Blistered so badly that I could not
wear it longer, and still no relief was
gained, although the Belt was guaranteed
to Cure Anything in Sciatica in One
Month. You bet I was very much dis-
couraged in regard to Electric Belts.
However, I was persuaded to come and
just see you, gentlemen. I then found
that I had been wearing a Torture Belt
and very Wrongly Applied, and quite
enough to give and patient a Horror of
so-called Electric Belts. After the con-
sultation I decided to place myself in your
hands. I knew my case was very diffi-
cult, as I was compelled to follow my em-
ployment, and standing at the vice was
irksome, and the complaint was a very
stubborn one. However, gentlemen, your
Belt, coupled with your advice, has made
me a grateful patient. I thank you kindly
for supplying me with a remedy which has
Completely Cured Me, and strongly recom-
mend it to all and sundry that I find are
suffering from the distressing malady
called “ Sciatica.”
I have not been wearing the Belt for the
past fortnight, but have passed it over to
my wife, who has received great benefit
for nervous troubles.
I remain, your grateful patient,

Goldenhair.
At the mellow twilight bell,
At the passing of a day
That has blest the world full well
In its wanton, wanton way,
Through the shadow at my heart,
Past the young Dreams on the stair,
Lustrous from her mystic art
Cometh she. Queen Goldenhair.
Frail arms crush me, white lips press
To my mouth deliciously !
God above will surely bless
Heart’s dear heart, your love, and me.
He hath knowledge of our ways—
What is that upon the stair ?
*Tis an echo of dead days —
Passionate, my Goldenhair.
There were roses in those days
In that dim Arcadian deep,
Fairy bells with drowsy gaze,
Woke, to smile us, from their sleep.
Mating doves in rustling heights,
Nestling in a leafy lair,
Cooed our song of love delights,
Yours and mine, O Goldenhair !
Ah, the some that trust too well!
Untamed love will surely reel
Blinded to a bitter hell
Where there is no balm to heal.
Faultlessly we loved to live,
Kiss me now, my fairy fair;
Had we aught to plead, forgive—
No repentance, Goldenhair!
Underneath, above the skies,
Never love as ours could be !
Take that shadow from your eyes,
Shadow of Eternity;
And the vesture at your breast,
Let me rend it, so, apart,
That my soul may seek its nest,
Snowy nest, about thine heart.
Dreaming in communion sweet,
Leave me, heart’s heart, nevermore—
Hist! a footstep in the street
And a hand against the door ;
And a Something, sorrow-shod,
Muttering up the crazy stair ;
Higher—nigher—quick—Ah, God !
Kiss me—fly—O Goldenhair !
Q.
C. L. RIVERS.
The Sister.
We watch and adore from afar
As she passes along.
As ivell may we clutch at a star
Or the sound'of a song.
“Sister ! ” I’ve heard it at night,
In the hour when the sufferers wake
And turn their faces so white
To watch for the morning to break.
A hand, cool and firm, sn the brow,
And a soft—“Sleep, sleep for awhile.’*
There are strong men who think of her now—
Who dream of her glorious smile.
Sometimes she sings us a tune
That lifts happy tears to our eyes.
And Life seems a roadway rose-strewn,
That leads us to Paradise.
“Sister ! ” In years that have fli d
’Twas “Sweetheart,” and lips on her lips.
But they told her her sailor was dead,
And she will not look at the ships.
He came to-day from the ships—
At the door they called her by name—
And his lips were hot on her lips
Before she knew that he came.
And he laughed and took her an ay.
None dared to turn him aside
Who had fought through the clattering spray—
She went as a strong man’s bride.
We envied them from afar—
They were happy and strong.
Ah! the man from the sea stole our star ,
But we have her song.

God’s Rest.
I saw God in a dream go by,
As if He trod the phantom air
Within a hushed eternity,
Dead worlds aiound Him everywhere.
No sign of life—and God asleep !
All things absorbed in Him at last;
Nothing for him to care for, keep,
Since thought for everything had passed.
A mystic vision on its way,
His image filled the airy gloom,
As if His work were o’er for aye —
Himself His own creation’s tomb !
As if, when sleep fell on Him, all
Sensation, with a tremor, ceased,
As all things felt the weird recall,
And the gigantic strain released.
The world stayed still without a breath,
Entranced within the phantom air,
Since God had done with Life and Death,
And ta’en His thought from everywhere.
This was His Sabbath. In the past
’Tis said He rested for a day ;
But this great sleep of His would last,
Since He had done with all for aye.

The Miseries Caused
by a Torpid Liver.
The Only Safe Remedy Effects
a Perfect Cure.
The Case of Mrs. M. HICKEY.
(B? A SPECIAL REPORTER.)
There is much profound and important
wisdom in that old proverb where it is said
•—“ The heart knoweth its own bitterness.”
It forms part of a truth still more compre-
hensive—that every man knows his own
peculiar feelings, and difficulties, and trials
far better than he can get any of his
neighbours to perceive them, although in an
effort to convey such impressions to other
minds lately made by Mrs. Marian Hickey,
of No. 3 West-street, Paddington, the
subject dealt with was so clearly described
that no trouble should be experienced in
understanding her story.
“For several weeks,” said Mrs. Hickey,
“I had been feeling rather unwell, but
there was no particular cause for alarm
until one day I took a bad turn whilst doing
my work. Such a horrible feeling of faint-
ness came over me that I said I would see a
doctor, and so I did.”
“Did the doctor tell you what was
wrong ? ”
“ He said it was my liver and kidneys
which were causing the trouble, and that
the medicine which he prescribed was the
best thing I could have for my complaint,
but my sufferings, instead of getting less,
became fifty times worse than ever; so after
taking that medicine a while I thought I
had better hasten to another doctor and see
if he could bring me any relief. For a day
or two I was slightly easier, then the medi-
cine »;ad no effect upon me, and I drifted
to the lowest depths of wretchedness.
F.ven then I did not lose heart altogether,
for I consulted another physician, and then
another, and so on till I could see it was no
use going to any more. My courage failed
me after all those bitter experiences, and I
thought my only chance would be simply a
matter of luck. Il I could but get a good
physic amongst all those that were
advertised I might yet be relieved, I
thought; but after trying almost everything
procurable I was in a hopeless predica-
ment.” 0
“Are you sure you did not receive some
benefit from all those medicines ? ”
“None whatever. They made me worse,
for I became as helpless as a child. Yes,
twelve years ago I lost the use of my limbs.
Why, I could not put my hands to t»y head
to do m3' hair, and for five months I could
not walk except by the aid of sticks and
with some one to help mo along. Oh ! it
was terrible ; and to think that I was not
going to see my children grow up was a
source of constant anguish. I had given up
all hope of recovering, and felt as sure as I am
that I am sitting here that I would never
get better, and if you had seen me you
would have thought the same. You never
saw such a sigh', as I was—not a morsel of
flesh on my bones (I was as thin as a wafer),
and my cheeks quite sunken. With my
darkened complexion as well, I am sure I
looked the picture of death. I was awfully
nervous, too, for I used to jump up in the
middle of the night and fancy that some-
body was killing me, and if I had been able
to walk I would not have crossed the street,
a 9 if anybody came near me my limbs shook
like the bl anches of a tree. There was no
peace in life for me, and I was so melancholy
with the thought that I was dying that I
resigned myself to my fate. Heavy pains
in the chest gave me such a horrible choking
sensation that I was afraid to lie down, and
I had to be propped up in my chair because
of the excruciating pains in my side and
back, .deiween my shoulders the pain was
so severe that I used to have a lotion rubbed
in ; but that did not ease them, and the
piercing pains at the top and back of my
head nearly drove me frantic. My eyes felt
•s if they were not properly opened, the
sight also being very bad, and if I washed
my mouth out a dozen times a day, it made
no difference to the bitter taste that was
there. I had no appetite for food, and
what little I was obliged to take gave me
violent pains in the stomach, which seemed
to be tied in a knot. When those terrible
cramps came on I used to think, ‘ Oh, dear, I
am going to expire! ’ but even death would not
come to my relief. Soon afterwards, how-
ever, the food came up again, and it was
that constant vomiting which made me as
weak as a kitten. Giddiness and palpita-
tion came with the least movement, ahd I
felt so feeble that I knew the last *iregs of
life would soon be exhausted.”
“ Unless you received relief you mean ? ”
“I did not look for help, because I
thought I was past all worldly aid ; but, to
please a friend who came to see me, I
consented to try a bottle of Clements Tonic.
When that was emptied she insisted on me
taking more, and in a fortnight I really felt
the better for it. Something seemed to
whisper that I should persevere v ith
Clements Tonic, and, helpless and crippled
as I was, a new hope sprang up, becau e
Clements Tonic was stopping the fits of
vomiting, and I was sleeping well already.
Restlessness at nights had been one of my
greatest trials, but under Clements Tonic
I could soon sleep peacefully, without
dreams occurring to upset me. Then the
dreadful chest and stomach pains started to
decrease, and my headaches were less
frequent. For a time I could hardly realise
that I was being rescued, but when a g. od
appetite appeared and my food stayed down
regularly, 1 almost jumped with joy at the
knowledge that I was saved. For twelve
months I had suffered unspeakable torture
and misery, and those who had seen me
tottering on the brink of the grave were
amazed at the wonderful power of Clements
Tonic, wfiich cleared away the pains in my
side and shoulders, and drove the aching
sensations from my limbs, the use of which
I acquired by degrees. To be able to mix
with the outside world after despairing of
ever seeing it again is what I have to thank
Clements Tonic for, and I am sure I would
have been dead long ago only for that medi-
cine. The strengthening effects of Clements
Tonic were shown by the way I could go
about my work, as in a few weeks I was as
brisk and active as ever, and witli as much
happiness in life as I enjoyed before being
afflicted with that terrible sense of nervous
depression which nothing but Clements
Tonic could eradicate. The symptoms ot
kidney disease were banished simultaneously
with my liver disorders, and they were all
removed so effectively that for nearly eleven
years I have been blessed with the very best
of health. That is why I advise all my
friends to take Clements Tonic when they
are ill, and nothing pleases me more than
this interview, every word of which you
can publish in any form you like.”

Something’ in the Nature of a Farewell.
Sometime during the coming year, now close at
hand, there will be a State Election in New South
A Vales, and on present appearances it is likely to
b 3 the first one for over a dozen years when The
Bulletin’s vote will not go with the State
Labor party. This paper is as cordial as ever in
its support of the Commonwealth Labor party—
per'.iaps rather more cordial than ever, for that
party has, so far, put up a record that is even
better than was expected. But the State Labor
party has so degenerated that, unless it makes a
wholly new start, it is time for good Democrats to
get away from it. It has reached that point
where it is a misfortune that it should be nomi-
nally the standard-bearer of Progress, for nowa-
days it takes the standard down so many strange
bye-ways and into so much bad company that it is
getting soiled, and decent citizens grow ashamed
to rally round it. Unless there is a very great
political cleaning-up on the part of the N.S. W.
Labor party it will soon be time for the standard
to pass into new hands, for the reason that the
present bearer has been drinking— not literally,
but in a political sense.
» * * *
The.iirst item in every democratic programme
should be the abolition of borrowing, the estab-
lishment of a systematic movement towards the
repayment of the public debt, the getting of our
country out of pawn. That comes before the Eight
Hours Movement, Woman Suffrage, Coal Mines
Regulation, and almost everything else. The
borrowing disease is the centre of so many evils
that it is difficult to enumerate them all, but a
few of them are these :
(1) Borrowing, though it makes tempoiary bursts of
artificial prosperity, is ihe chief cause of permanent
want of employment. The money we borrow conies
here in the shape of goods, and therefore the
people who should be employed making these
goo,ls are out of work. New South .Wales, in 1902,
exported goods to the value of nearly £26,000,000,
of which about £6,000,000 was required to pay interest on
public and private foreign debts, leaving £20,000,000 to
pay for imports. It imported to the value of nearly
£24,000,000. If it hadn’t borrowed another £4,000,000
abroad it couldn't have imported to the value of more
than £20,000,000, and there would have been £4,000,000
worth more work for our own people.
(2) Because of the want of employment caused by
borrowing, this country is now almost the most pauperised
white man's country on earth. The pauperism doesn’t
appear openly, but the constant struggle to “absorb
labor” by building, out of loans, railways, roads, bridges
a id all manner of works far ahead of the reasonable
requirements of the population is pauperism.
(:j) II cause of borrowing, which furnishes an easy way
of making ends meet on paper, Australian finance has
become a disgrace to any white man’s country. The
'^ii1 ea khat in any system of honest finance ends
S "°j j . ma de to nieet lias been lost—smothered by the
sanddrift of loans and 1.0. - ’s.
(4) The borrowing disease has put the whole scheme of
material progress on an unsound basis. It has come to
»e a recognised article of political faith that all public
works must lie built out of loans ; that our whole
progress depends on loans; that when Cohen won’t
tend, public works—even the most necessary public
works must stop till he will lend ; that if he perman-
ently stops lending, all public works, however necessarv,
must cease permanently. This isn’t a healthy or manly
state of mind for any country to get into, and it is better
to get out of it novv than wait till Che debt is much larger,
and the state of mind more incurable.
(5) The borrowing disease is already making the demo-
cratic programme totter on its basis. While the disease
lasts we must have new loans, and we must get the old
* a U 3 • ( on any terms Coiien chooses to grant).
And if Coiien says that he won’t renew the loans of a
country run on “socialistic lines” (and he is already
beginning to drop hints like that), then we have either
to go bankrupt or go back to Toryism. Probably when
the pinch comes there will be a majority for
going back to Toryism The spectacle of a demo-
cralic policy depending wholly for its existence on
the willingness of blatant and aggressive Tories to lend
the money, and existing only as long as they will lend
the money, and being wholly at their mercy, is one of
the saddest jokes on earth.
*** ■ »
No Democratic party which doesn’t make the
abolition of borrowing the first plank of its plat-
form has any permanent standing. It exists by
the grace of -Cohen. And the N.S.W, Labor
party is in a peculiarly bad position. It has
held the balance of power for many . years.
Every borrowing Government that N.S.W.
has had since 1891 has been able to borrow,
and squander, and pile up deficits, entirely,
or almost entirely, by the aid of the Labor
vote. The Labor party is the only one which
can be. held responsible for the loan frenzies
and deficits of both parties. And it should have
been the best party in this respect instead of
being as bad as the worst. When a Carruthers
party borrows and booms and bursts it is only
dragging the Carrutiiers policy in the mud, and
this paper has never noticed anything about the
Carkuthers policy to show that the mud isn’t
the best place for it. When the See Ministry
goes on a loan drunk it only drops its own poli-
tical principles in the gutter, and its political
principles are so indefinite and useless that the
gutter is as good a spot to leave them as any
other. But when the Labor party, which has (or
once had) a good set of principles, though it has
lost sight of the best principle of all, lets itself
get into the financial gutter with Carruthers
and into the mud with See it is time for Demo-
crats to object. If Toryism gets a set-back
through being associated with public bankruptcy,
that is nothing to grieve over, but for Democratic
principles to be brought-into disrepute in the same
fashion is something to grieve over. It isn’t good
enough to be simply no worse than See and just
about as bad as Joey Carruthers.
* * * *
The democratic programme necessarily increases
the cost of government—and it is well worth the
increased cost. To take only one example, old
age pensions mean money—a great deal of money.
And no part} 7 has a right to advocate increased
expenditure, even in a good cause, without also
looking after the means of meeting that expendi-
ture it has no right to bring a good cause into
discredit. As matters stand, old age pensions are
associated in the public mind with huge deficits
and enormous loans, and they are being brought
into ill odor and disrepute. The fact that
there were huge loans and deficits before pensions
existed doesn’t help to make these democratic
principles smell any better in the nose of a short-
memoried public. If the present drift lasts for a
few years more, and the great stoppage of credit
comes when N.S.W. owes £100,000,000 and its
land revenue has largely run out, there will be a
period of ghastly poverty before the State adjusts
itself to the new conditions. The stoppage will
mean less imports, more local production, and
more work, but until the new work is started
there will be a woefully bad time. It will be
just about then that somebody will point out that
the abolition of old age pensions and many other
things will help, materially to make ends meet,
and the public will then be cheerfully convinced
that it was because of these things that ends
didn’t meet before, and that they caused all
the trouble and disaster. Big loans and big
deficits are preparing the way for a crisis. The
Tory party can best meet a crisis; it has resources
in the way of callous economy and plain robbery
that a Democratic party doesn’t possess. That
will be its opportunity, and it will have the great
lie and howl of an unscrupulous daily press to
back it up ; and a scared people will turn on the
Labor party and rend it. Already the Sydney
daily press is preparing the way.
* * • *
The N.S.W. Labor party is a smal. one, and
easily rent when once the financial crisis brings
the other political elements together. It has had
the extraordinary luck that it has been in a
position to make four Ministries keep honest,
and it hasn’t attempted to make one Ministry
keep honest. It had the chance to associate the
Democratic policy with honesty, solvency, and
financial independence, and it dropped the chance.
Nowadays it seems to have a vague idea that its
legislative work is done, and that it has merely to
sit down in a complete and finished world, and
keep its eye, as a matter of administration, on
Bill’s dirt-money, and inquire into the case of a
dismissed messenger, and see that the workmen
get so many shillings a day on the useless job
that is paid for out of loans, and to apologise for
the Owe’See Government when it gets into
trouble regarding the Citizens’ Life Assurance Co.
It has no financial policy, and unless it gets one—
and a good one—its usefulness is about ended.
* * » •
There is no reason, save incapacity and coward-
ice, why N.S.W. should not cease borrowing, and
provide .£2,000,000 a year for public works out
of revenue, and also set aside £250,000 a year in
reduction of its old debts. The State Government,
according to the latest returns just issued, has
now about £2,200,000 more revenue available than
it had three years ago; that is to say, the State
revenue has increased by about £1,200,000, and
fully £1,000,000 of the old State expenditure has
been assumed by the Australian Government.
Even after allowing for old age pensions the State
has £1,700,000 more to spend than it had three
years ago. It should be possible, by hard economy
and the abolition of useless billets and political
frills, to get back, except in the matter of old age
pensions, to somewhere near the expenditure of
the year 1900. Then, by imposing graduated land-
tax, by increased income-tax, absentee-tax, extra
railway rates, and by ceasing to send to the Austra-
lian Parliament men who are pledged to sacrifice
revenue for the benefit of the importer, it should
be possible to find, out of revenue, £2,000,000 a
year for public works and £250,000 a year
towards a sinking: fund. If any party will
arise which will -make this policy—the policy
of paying o‘f our debt and making ends meet,
not by selling our lands or our railways,
or by sheer grit—the first plank of its plat-
form, that party will have all the support The
Bulletin can give it. Even if that one item is
the only progressive item in its programme, IHE
Bulletin will regard it, by reason of that item,
as more democratic than the N.S.W. State Labor
party is now. If the N.S.W. State Labor patty
will become the Anti-Borrowing party it will be
so much the better, but if it won’t it is
time for all real Democrats to disown it,
and to declare as publicly as possible that Demo-
cratic ideals are not bound up with big deficits,
big loans, Owe’Sullivanism, with John See’s life
assurance office, and with the system of having no
financial policy, and winking at a most disreput-
able system of finance in-return for the addition
of 6d. a day to Bill’s wages at Fitzroy dock. And
if there is no hope of establishing a real Anti-
Borrowing party in N.S.W. Assembly, it would
be better for the present Labor party to disappear
altogether. Then, when something very bad hap-
pened to the finances of a hideously misgoverned
State, the See and Carruthers factions could
divide the obloquy between them. The Bulletin
knows nothing sufficiently to their credit to sup-
ply 7 any reason why they shouldn’t have all the
obloquy that happens to be going.
* * * •
On the other hand, if the N.S.W. State Labor
party will become the Anti-Borrowing party—the
party of economy ; the party that insists on finding
£2,000,000 a year of public works funds, and some-
thing over towards a sinking-fund, out of revenue;
and the party which will support no Government
which doesn’t adhere to these terms—it will give
its cause the biggest lift it has ever yet received.
It will make Progress and Solvency synonymous
terms. It will deprive its enemies of their
strongest arguments. It will compel many people
to join it who, otherwise, would not be found dead
in the same paddock with a Labor member or a
Labor principle. It will secure a world-wide
advertisement, for Australia’s borrowings have
become a world-wide joke, and the first great Anti-
Borrowing party in Australia will create a surprise
that will make half the Cohens on earth faint in
their synagogue. But The Bulletin, looking at
the N.S.W. State Labor party’s recent record,
has so little hope that it bids the party a tenta-
tive farewell. If the N.S.W. State Labor party
becomes a real Democratic party the farewell can
be withdrawn, but the prospect of withdrawal
looks very poor at present. This paper only hopes
that the leader it will find itself constrained to
vote for won’t be Stinson. It would be a dreadful
thing to have to vote for Stinson.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Petriana Wreck Lie.
In the case of the Petriana wreck, about which
the Argus and Telegraph and Herald, and all
the organs of Toryism and Freetrade, raged so
bitterly during election week, these papers, and
the Tory class which they represented, reached
their top-note in the chorus of political lies. The
Petriana! an oil ship, went ashore off Point
Nepean, near Melbourne, early one morning
during a dense fog. There was no wind, and the sea
was calm—cahr er than the still, calm Irvine. The
Petriana carried a black crew which was in no
danger on board the ship—in no more danger than
the white captain. For two days attempts to tug
the vessel off the rocks were persevered with.
When it became perfectly certain that there was
no chance of getting the Petriana off, it was
determined to abandon her. The Merchant
Shipping Act provides that the agents of a ship-
wrecked crew must look after that crew and send
the men back to the country from which they were
shipped. The Immigration Restriction Act pro-
vides that no undesirable immigrant shall be
allowed.to land, or if he does so land, that the ship-
owner or his agent shall be responsible for seeing
that the said undesirableimmigrant leavestheCom-
monwealth within a reasonable time. If the un-
desirable immigrant is not thus re-shipped, the
party landing him is liable to a fine of JBIOO. The
crew of the Petriana consisted of very undesirable
immigrants. Some inquiries were set on foot by
the owner’s agents in Melbourne as to whether
they could land the niggers and take no responsi-
bility of seeing that they were re-shipped. They
were mildly informed that they could land any
number of niggers provided they undertook the
responsibilities cast upon -.them under both the
Merchant Shipping Act and the Immigration Re-
striction Act. This the agents refused to do. They
preferred to engage a tug and keep the niggers of
the Petriana crew out in the bay to prevent their
escape. The crew was kept in the bay for a day
or two, and then re-shipped to Singapore, via
Hongkong. These facts were twisted into the
biggest and grossest lies that even a Tory pro-
fessional liar has yet succeeded in manufacturing.
There were wild word-pictures of our black
brudder perishing in a howling sea because the
Commonwealth would not allow him to swim
ashore ; and the case was held to prove that if a
perishing nigger swam ashore on these coasts
Alfred Deakin would personally throw him in
again, and Philip Fysh would give him an extra
shove into deep water with a long pole, and Bill
Lyne would throw shingle at him while he
drowned. The black men were well treated, well
fed, and shipped home again. Otherwise they were
dealt with exactly according to the law which was
passed with the enthusiastic and almost unanimous
approval of the Freetrade party in the Australian
Parliament. That party took to itself great glory
for helping to pass the Act, and its attempt to
crawl into office by denouncing the Deakin
Government for doing exactly what it was
bound to do under the Act that the said Frje-
trade party helped to pass was a very abject
affair. The Petriana people, of course, joined in
the uproar. They knew, when they brought
their nigger crew to Australia, exactly what
responsibilities they took, and they weren’t asked
to do anything that wasn’t in the bond. But
when they found an election in progress, and
a party cavorting round which was prepared, for
the sake of a few misguided votes, to lie about
them as crushed and ill-used citizens, they
naturally cavorted also in hopes of getting out of
their fair legal responsibilities, and dodging their
fair and honest bill. Any commercial person
would cavort under similar conditions.

The Pries of Australia’s Subjection.
Max Stelling, born in Egypt, the son of an
Egyptian mother and German father, was mixed
up in a smuggling transaction with the steward of
the German ship in which he lately reached New-
castle, and was sentenced to six months’ gaol.
Just before the term expired a customs officer
turned up, asked him to read a passage of Greek,
and as he couldn’t do it he was treated as a pro-
hibited immigrant. In other words, he is held as
a prisoner, nominally for six months, though if he
can get away earlier he will be welcome to go.
Out of this incident the abominably unpatiiotic
press of Sydney and of a good part of Australia
has made an election crv, declaring the treatment
of the man to be barb irous, and generally, for
party purposes, holding Australia up to ridicule
and contempt. Certainly the incident is ridicu-
lous, and Australia’s position almost contemptible.
It is ridiculous that Australia should be denied
the right to directly shut out this foreign criminal
and undesirable character just as Victoria shuts
outN.S.W.criminals. Even the S.M. HEBALDand
D.T. would refuse to Ijave about their premises a
man who tried to steal the door-mat or any other
loose trifle as he was coming in. It is almost con-
temptible to have to resort to a subterfuge in order
to kick the man out —to offer the man the run of
the house if he qan read something that we know
pretty well he can’t read, and then kick him out
if he can’t. Australia ought to be in a position
to eject the half-breed Egyptian, not because he
can’t read Greek, but because, in the only transac-
tion it ever had with him, he proved himself a
criminal, and in every civilised country.on earth
the prevention of the influx of foreign criminals is
regarded as a matter of absolute necessity. It
isn’t Australia’s fault that it hasn’t this right ; it
isn’t its fault that it has to tell a man that it is
refusing him admission for one thing when, as amat-
ter of fact, it is refusing him admission for another.
It is quite willing to go straight and tell the
truth ; but it is not allowed to, and it is Britain
that won’t allow it. It was Britain that insisted
upon the miserable backdoor “education test’’;
and it was, it may be noticed in passing, George
Reid and George Reid’s party—the party that
is making all the row now—that first accepted
that test, and made it law in New South Wales
long before it was law for all Australia. If
George Reid had then made a fight, the full right
to frankly bar such undesirables as Stelling
might have been conceded ; but the other satisfied
George Reid, who was then Premier—being a
backstairs and more or less crooked way of arriving
at a desired result, it probably appealed to him.
This is the utmost that Britain will concede Aus-
tralia in the matter of barring immigrants. In that
case we see one of the prices Australia has to pay
for its connection with Britain : it must dissem-
ble ; it must be a trickster; it may do the right
thing, but it must pretend to be doing something
else. Whether the world will think better of
either Australia or of Britain for pursuing this
policy of crooked cunning is another matter. But
all that is part of the price ; and it will have to
be reckoned in when Australia comes to count up
whether the pr ce isn’t too high.

The Degraded Daily Press.
The Australian daily press is fast acquiring a
villainously bad reputation, which didn’t improve
during the recent electoral campaign. If there
ever was anything of the so-called English virtue
of fair-play—supposing such a virtue, exists—in
Australia, it has wholly disappeared so far as a
large section of the press is concerned. In the
way of degraded lying, foul slanders and sordid
misrepresentations, many of the Australian dailies
are calculated to shock an aboriginal and make a
Chinaman feel that he has met with a friend and
brother. The unanimity of their lying during
the recent campaign was almost magnificent.
When a handful of wrecked Malay sailors were
taken off their ship, well cared for. and sent
back to their native land, the Tory dailies started
a theory that they were drowned on the shores of
Australia because a shockingly inhuman Federal
Government wouldn’t let them land on account of
their color; and almost every Freetrade and Tory
paper took it up, and repeated it with a dogged
persistence that carried belief, in many cases, solely
by reason . of its persistence. Though every
person of intelligence knows perfectly well that
no six hatters were ever excluded from Australia
by the Barton-Deakin Government, yet the
unamimous wail of the Tory press that that
Government should be expelled from office
for excluding six hatters, and thereby covering
Australia with disgrace, sounded so genuine that
it might have passed for the cry of a broken
heart, and the groan of a pure and disinterested
spirit suffering under tribulation. A handful of
Australian papers is fast creating the impression
that there is no truth, honesty nor decent
public spirit in this country, and that Aus-
tralia in general is as degraded as its
press. A country is judged by the papers
it keeps, even if it keeps them through
sheer apathy. And, strangely enough, the men
who supply Australia with this sort of literature
claim to be honest gentlemen, and their claim is
not generally repudiated—also, to a great extent,
through apathy. It seems to be quite com-
monly held that an individual may tell lies daily
to the public at large and yet be regarded as a
truthful person ; and that he may be, in his offi-
cial capacity, a malignant slanderer for hire,
and yet be considered an honest and reputable
citizen in between times. Some day, perhaps,
there will be a moral revival, and the man who
tells gross falsehoods to GO, 000 people for money
will rank no higher in public estimation than the
individual who lies privately to one person gratis.
He will find his level as a common perjurer, and
an individual with false evidence for sale to who-
ever will buy. Unless some such revival comes
about it seems that the present carnival of
slander, misrepresentation, untruth and press
blackguardism is likely to continue indefinitely.
There is no visible remedy except in
the arising of a public spirit which will
make clean-minded citizens refuse to associate
with the stipendiary falsifier—which will make
them hold it no excuse that he is a hack who
receives money for his slanders, or a wealthy
capitalist who pays liberally for having un-
truths invented and circulated. There is alto-
gether too much tendency to split the human
being up lengthwise into two capacities, and
assume that the business half of him may be
a sweater, an adulterator, or an inventor of
malignant calumny to order, without any disgrace
or loss attaching to the other or private half.

A Bank and Some Reflections.
Ii won’t do any harm to recall now to the
memory of a country which needs a lot of
reminding of some things, that the failure of the
Bank of New Zealand 10 years ago, and the
patching-up which has been called for several
times since—the last time only a week or so ago—
was due to O we’Sullivan-ism and littleelse. Vogel
had much the same ideas that the Ovve’See has
been afflicted with. He wanted to make a splash.
He talked unendingly of the magnificent resources
of the country—and pawned them. Between
1871 and 1892 Australasia borrowed, for
public and private purposes, £246,000,000, of
which Maoriland’s little lot was £44,000,000, most
of it taken between 1875 and 1885. No country
with a handful of people could absorb so much in
a natural way. A condition of artificial prosperity
andgaiish magnificence was produced. Instead,
however, of putting it down to the borrowings, it
was all credited to the “ magnificent resources” ;
and, when the artificial prosperity eased a little,
the only thing the Vogel party could think of
was to borrow again and “ develop ” the resources
still more. But the time arrived when the system
came to a temporary stop, just as the time
has come to the Owe’See. Instead of living


luxuriously on borrowed money, a demora-
lised country had to live almost entirely on
its own earnings, reduced now by , th .® . interes ‘ l
on the £44,000,000. The struggle to do this lasted
for a year or two, and then was given up as hope-
less The Bank of N.Z. had done business on the
boom basis; it had either to do it that way or not
do any at all. Values fell, securities had to be
taken over wholesale at an enormous sacrifice,
and the State had to find £2,500,000 somewhere
and somehow to cover the deficiency. There have
been since then 10 years of partially clean poli-
tical living and great industrial prosperity ; and
vet even now, the bank has been obliged to ask
for’ £1,500,000 from the State—£soo,ooo for
shares and £1,000,000 by way of guaranteed loan.
New South Wales has just had a loan drunk, not so
long, it is true, but even more intense while it
lasted ; and the idea prevails that just one good
season will put the State on its feet again. Yet
here is a case in which an almost national institu-
tion, the victim of just such a “drunk,” has not
been able to get really on its feet even after 10
years of steadily increasing, and at times pheno-
menal prosperity. The Owk’See’s excuse for the
drunk—the latter part of it, anyway—was that, a
bad season having come, it was necessary to borrow
in order to keep things going. Even assuming that
it was a bad season (and it has been shown that,
in other directions —mining, for example—the
season was unusually good), this means that, after
years of borrowing—after contracting a public
debt almost the greatest in the world—the State
cannot carry on through one little streak of
adversity without going to the pawnshops in a
huge, wholesale way. No more crushing indict-
ment of the foreign-capital policy could be filed
than that. N.S.W. had half-a-dozen excellent
seasons, the Broken Hill mines had given millions
of unsuspected wealth to the country, wool prices
had been better, the coal industry had flourished,
and still the State has not been able to stand a
partial failure of one single harvest. This, of
course, merely strengthens the Maoriland experi-
ence—that the borrowing disease breeds a weak-
ness which not one year, and not ten years, of
prosperity can fully repair. And Maoriland, in
the midst of the repairing process, has started
another considerable loan drunk, the results of
which will appear later.
The N.S.W. Labor Party’s Cheap Labor
Paper.
During the late electoral campaign the N.S.W.
Labor party assumed an attitude—or allowed an
attitude to be assumed in its name—which
requires a good deal of explanation. The party
is understood to have “sunk the fiscal issue,” and
however unwise and absurd that pretence may be,
the party, while the pretence lasts, should at
least endeavor to make it a plausible pretence.
Unfortunately it does nothing of the kind. The
Worker is understood to be the press organ of
Labor in N.S.W. In election matters, it
ably—very ably—supports the Labor candidate
where there is one. In those cases where
there is no Labor candidate it almost un-
disguisedly supports the Freetrade candidate if it
speaks at all, or at least it throws its angry sneer
and its half-brick of scorn at the Protectionist
candidate. When it took a hand in the Federal
election, wherever direct Labor interests were not
involved, it was for the party that shouts for the
free admission of the goods of the foreign blackleg,
the foreign cheap laborer, the foreign nigger and
the foreign Chinaman —all to down the Australian
unionist. It hardly made any secret of the fact
that its leanings were towards the crowd which now
jeers at the Aliens Restriction law—the side which
is represented by the anti-Labor Telegraph and
S.M. Herald and Argus —the side which says
that no Australian unionist workman should
get the job if some foreign blackleg
oji ’ :blackfellow will do it for a fraction
side which runs the lie about
the .' excluded six hatters who weren’t
excluded, and the fabrication about the drowned
Malay sailors of the Petriana who weren’t
drowned. This sore of thing isn’t sinking the
fiscal issue. Where no Labor candidate is directly
concerned the organ of Labor in N.S.W. almost
looks as if it were owned by Bruce Smith, and
run by Austin Zeal, and maintained in the worst
interests of Toryism.
The Shindykit* of Slowbart.
Thk ancient and fish-like Vandemonian way of
doing things is strikingly illustrated just now by
the respective positions of the Hobart Corpora-
tion, the Hobart Gas Co., and the Hobart Tram-
ways Co. The Corporation, some years ago,
made over the streets of the city to the Tramways
Co. in perpetuity. The Tramways Co._ is, to all
intents and purposes, a foreign corporation. The
Gas Co. also enjoys a close monopoly, by which it
supplies gas to the Corporation and the citizens
at an extremely high price. But the proper light
for Hobart is obviously the electric, since the coal
necessary and suitable for the making of gas has
to be brought a long distance by sea. And
further, owing to the close monopoly enjoyed by
the Gas Co. and its consistent preference for
keeping up dividends rather than reducing the
price to consumers, it does not seem reasonably
probable that gas will ever be substantially cheaper.
However, some years ago the Gas Co. obtained
electric lighting powers also, and here again suc-
ceeded in establishing a partial monopoly. But
the Corporation presently turned over in its sleep
and acquired lighting 1 powers of its own—on
which it promptly slept with renewed determina-
tion. The Gas Co. strongly discouraged the use
of the electric light, by making it as costly as
possible; and last year the Tramways Co. got
angry at the Gas Co., and succeeded in obtaining
from Parliament lighting powers along a belt ex-
tending fifty yards on each side of the tram routes.
To this concession the Gas Co. bitterly objected, and
the Corporation (temporarily awake some more)
also objected with some fluency. The City Council
still has a theoretic intention of lighting the town
some day; but nobody takes the City Council
seriously. And now the Tramways Co. applies to
Parliament to have its lighting powers materially
extended, and the Council and the Gas Co. are
once again refreshingly indignant. The plain
fact —everybody knows it—is that the City Council
will never do anything particularly sane or reason-
able till the present infamous system which puts
all civic power in the hands of propertied plural
voters is abolished. If the City Council in the
past had been sane and reasonable, neither the
gas monopoly nor the tramways monopoly would
ever have existed.

The N.S.W. Day-Labor Inquiry.
It is announced that an official inquiry into the
“day-labor system” in N.S.W. elicits that it is
unsound. As a matter of fact, there has been
little of a “system ” to be unsound or otherwise.
Day-labor employment, in any case, is a principle
rather than a system ; and the fact that it fails
under certain circumstances doesn’t condemn the
principle, though it may condemn the application
of it. No one is foolish enough to say that steam-
power is an unsound principle because Bent’s
engines, manned by blacklegs, have broken
down and landed passengers in the middle
of nowhere at the dead of night. That
circumstance, everybody knows, is merely a
reflection on Bent and his blacklegs, not on
Watt and Stephenson and steam. Theoretically,
day-labor employment is unquestionably sound.
It eliminates the contractor and his profits. It
gets rid of the incentive to “scamp” work. It
abolishes sweating. Certainly, there are times
when under it work cannot be done as cheaply ;
but that is not always a demerit. There are
other things to be considered besides cheapness ;
it is possible to get men at such low wages that
they can’t pay their rent to the Fatman, can’t buy
M ‘Millan’s softgoods, can’t pay their taxes (to
the great detriment of the revenue), and can’t
support the local grocer, butcher, tailor, boot-
maker, jeweller, draper, &c., as these estimable
persons deserve to be supported. It is possible to
get wages so low that people will give up buying
the Sydney Telegraph to save the penny, and
give up advertising in it to save the shilling, and
when it won’t be worth while for the big draper
to put in big column notices, for it is no use
appealing with drapery to a people whose wages
are so low that they can’t buy drapery. If the
blessed era of low wages arrived in real earnest
three-fourths of the shops of Sydney would have
to close, and three-fourths of its houses would be
deserted (for four families would huddle into one
house), and three of its four daily papers might as
well give up publication. Merely stating that
day-labor costs more than contract labor doesn’t
necessarily prove anything—perhaps it ought to
cost more. The only point really worth insisting on
is that works should be paid for out of revenue
instead of out of loans. So long as the works
are paid for by this generation, this
generation has a right to build them as
expensively as it pleases. This generation
pays the money, and this generation gets
the money back again in customs duties, excise
duties, income-tax, land-tax, and in the pleasure
of knowing that the worker is enabled
to buy M ‘Millan’s goods, and pay for Randal
Carey’s daily paper, and support J. T. Walker’s
life assurance institution, and be punctual with
the rent of Vickery’s cottage, and give a well-
deserved support to Tooth’s beer. Moreover, if
all current expenditure is paid out of revenue,
there is a solid and reliable and continuous check
on extravagance. When the Ministry spends the
revenue extravagantly the fact declares itself
immediately, and 1,400,000 people, with the fear
of new taxation upon them, want to know the
reason why. When it spends the loan money
extravagantly the people may notice it a few
years later—but that isn’t exactly the same
thing. It is the loan system, not the day-labor
system, which requires abolition. With the for-
mer abolished the latter can take care of itself.

M‘Millan’s Circular in Defence of
Protection.
At a country meeting where he had talked of the
glory that comes to a country through importing
all the calico it wears, William M'Millan was
asked an awkward question about the circular
issued by his firm in which it was announced that,
following upon the tariff, the firm had added to
its factories, and was now selling high-class goods
at “ below Freetrade prices.” This, according to
the D.T., was M'Mtllans reply
It is not Messrs. W. and A. M‘ Arthur that held the
Wentworth seat in the Federal Parliament. That circu-
lar was published by my firm, and I may say that I have
sacrificed my firm very much. Is the cause of Protection
so weak and puerile that those who believe in it have got
to send all over Australia a circular published by Messrs.
W. and A. M‘Arthur ?
In other words, either M’Millan issued the circu-
lar and told untruths in the circular, or he told
untruths in his political capacity when he denied
the statements contained in the circular ; or else
his partners issued the circular without M‘Mil-
lan’s cognisance, or, at any rate, without his appro-
val. In the latter case the community has to decide
whether it will believe M‘Millan’s firm when it
says prices are lower under Protection, or
M'Millan himself when he says prices are higher.
It is most likely that it was M‘Millan’s partners
who issued the circular. M‘Millan’s partners
are men who make flannel waistcoats and things
that is their sole business, and they attend to that
alone. M'Millan, on the other hand, lias been
standing with one leg in Parliament and the other
behind the counter, and naturally he hasn t been
a success in either case; he. has “sacrificed his
firm ’' and he has sacrificed his constituents. But
M‘Millan’B partners, who don’t have to spare an
eye to catch either votes or the Speaker s eye, and
who can keep both legs behind the counter—who
know, in short, the whole business of making flannel
waistcoats and things, and have and know no other
business — they give this testimony to Protection
and to the Deakin tariff to which the divided
M ‘Millan is so much opposed. And their testi-
mony is worth something; M‘Millan s, being
that of a man who has too much to do to do
any of it well, wouldn’t count for anything.
The public,*or a large section of it, has hitherto
been inclined to put a good deal of confidence in
what M‘Millan said on the ground that he was a
successful business man. The success of the firm
of W. and A. M‘Arthttr has been reflected upon
him. Now, however, the public knows that
M'Millan and the M ‘Arthur firm are separate
and distinct entities, holding quite different
views about things; wherefore M'Millan isn t
entitled to any reflected glory whatever. Yet
without that glory—well, would M‘MILLAN ever
have been heard of ?
Bait for the Red Indian.
That cheap*jack assurance concern, the 1.0. F.,
which was introduced to Australia by. a. Red
Indian doctor, and which, in the preliminary
advertisements, dwelt, not so much upon the
solvency of the society as upon the im-
posing shape of its grand panjandrum s nose,
has been oresented in a somewhat new light
during the past week or so. Hitherto it has been
considered exclusively, or almost exclusively, as a
society which has, so far, accumulated about five-
pence in the £ of the amount which it has pledged
itself to pay to its policy-holders, and as a. society
which, if it can’t otherwise meet its claims, has
the right to increase the premiums and make a call
upon its policy-holders. It has now to be con-
sidered also as a society which, not content
with pursuing cheap-jack methods in its
advertisements, has introduced them also to
Australian politics. Not able to travel upon, its
own merits —for the whole system upon which it is
based is a delusion and a snare —it apparently seeks
to hook clients by first hooking men who have more
or less prominent names to recommend them.
Few people, comparatively speaking, understand
the science of life assurance; and of that com-
parative few there are very few indeed among
those to whom the 1.0. F. chiefly appeals. A few
plausible statements, backed up by a few promi-
nent names, and the small clients are un-
fortunately just as ready to become mem-
bers of a bad society as of a sound one.
In the case of the 1.0. F. they are told
that the society has paid every claim as
it has fallen due ; and the Red Indian asks,
with fine indignation, how dare anyone traduce a
society which has done that ? There is at such
times nobody on hand to remark that the claims
have been met by taking from the funds a great
part of what ought to have been put aside to
meet claims which have not yet .matured. The
most hopeless society that ever bought a brass
plate could, with ordinary luck, last a little
while; the collapse would come when, having
exhausted its assurance fund in order to pay the
earlier claims, it would be left without accumu-
lated funds to pay the later ones. And that, is
likely to be the position of this Red Indian
society: in order to pay the widows of the
members who have already died, it has left itself
with only about sd. in the £ of the amount of
insurance held by those members whose wives
have yet to become widows. But the society
won’t necessarily snuff out. If it can’t pay,
something quite new to Australia may happen—
(l) It may increase the premiums.
(2) It may make a call ; or
(3) If the astonished policyholder rebels, and won t pay
up (or if he can’t pay up) a higher amount than he had
bargained for, the policy will be forfeited and he will get
absolutely nothing.
Nothing of this sort can happen in connection
with a policy in any established Australian
office. And no such hook was at all likely to be
taken while it was exposed. The Red Indian
society’s only hope of success was to bait it; and
for all sorts of fish all sorts of bait.' For some
there was the fascination of remoteness. It
wasn’t a local concern. It had its home away out
in Canada, and it looked attractive because it was
a long way off. For others there was the
picturesque Red Indian doctor himself, and his
majestic nose, and large head of hair,, and the
other things mentioned in the advertisements.
And for others the wily fishers baited their hook
with Peacock, and, let it be said with regret,
with George Turner. Possibly there were other
politicians ; these two for certain. Peacock was
misunderstood by the Argus to say that he was
given a paid-up policy; he says now that
he pays the premiums. Turner does the
same ; * nobody ever suspected that he didn’t.
But Peacock, on his own confession, had a know-
ledge of the methods of the society which it does
not seem that Turner possessed—no doubt they
took good care that Turner should not be
alarmed ; as bait, he was too valuable to frighten
off. With Peacock, they took greater liberties;
while the 1.0. F. was under hot discussion they
handed him £5O in notes to pass on to a new
member for his election expenses. It was not a
bribe, of course; yet what does an assurance
society hand round £5O notes, taken presumably
from its assurance funds, for? That the money
was not accepted goes for nothing ; it was offered,
and that was as much as the 1.0. F. could do.
Even the 1.0. F. can’t compel a man to take a
bribe, or £5O which isn’t a bribe; it can only
offer it. Peacock thus knew the sort of society
it was; and yet he continued to associate with
it. Possibly—not being nearly as wide-awake
a person as he has sometimes been credited with
being—he didn’t know the public harm that he
was doing ; possibly he didn't grasp the fact that
he was bait. Even now there is no sign that he
realises it. Turner, on the other hand, with a
bigger reputation to lose, promptly cut his con-
nection with the society as soon as he found what
sort of a society it was. That is one bait the less,
anyhow; and, with Turner off, the public may
have a better chance to see the hook. And, after
all, that is the most important point.
♦
Jawbone Neild, he of the nocenc waterspout and
the wild moustache, found a new evidence, during
the recent campaign, of the horrors of Protection.
Under the Federal tariff some 200 extra hands
are employed in the brushmaking industry, and,
according to Neild, “it would pay the painters,
etc., of the Commonwealth to subscribe to close
up the factories, and subsidise the workmen to
walk about the streets, ” sending the money for
brushes to Germany. Which is logical, in a sorb
of nocent waterspout fashion. But, after all,
there are difficulties in the way. When this sort
of thing is done all round, there will be about 60,000
people walking the streets, as well as the 200
brushmakers. And the house-painters can’t subsi-
dise them all to walk about in order that cheap
things may be imported. And then there will soon
be 60,000 less houses to paint, which will be bad for
the house-painters. And when we buy from
abroad everything that the foreigner can produce
more cheaply than we do, we will have an awful
lot of extra imports to pay for, and we must
produce something with which to pay for them,
whether we can produce that something more
cheaply than other people do or not. The
question, in short, is this: If we are to buy
everything from abroad that some foreigner can
produce more cheaply than we do, we must still
pay for it. We can only pay for it, according to
the Neild doctrine, by exporting something that
we can produce more cheaply than anybody
else. And is there any such article; also
if there is, is it something that the outer world
wants in sufficiently large quantities—some-
thing apart from kangaroo-tail ? It is best
to make sure of that first. The country can’t live
by exporting crows and drought, or by admiring
Neild’s face-hair. It must produce something,
even if there is somebody somewhere who can
produce the same thing |d. cheaper. According
to the Freetrade doctrine, there is only one man
on earth who has a right to produce anything—
the cheapest man. There must be somewhere the
one cheapest man on earth.
«.
“ C.” lodges a just complaint:—
In spite of all protestations to the contrary, there is
something decidedly wrong about an M.L.A. running a
land agency business, the essence of which is to obtain
concessions from the Lands Department, which the land-
owner cannot obtain on his own. For instance, if after
repeated applications for rent, or instalments, and
numerous threats of forfeiture, a selector’s land is at
last gazetted as forfeited, he is liable, a few days later, to
receive a circular from a metropolitan land agent drawing
attention to the Gazette notice, and offering, for a con-
sideration, to get the forfeiture cancelled. What sort of
a row would there be if an “Agent for Justice”
offered for a fee to get Judges’ decisions re-
versed by private interview? That the adminis-
tration of N.S.W.’s land law has always been
a scandal no one can deny who has had experience of it;
and the wire-pulling land-agent is only a small spot in
the rottenness of the system. The department will never
have a chance of being run decently until it is managed
by commissioners, free of all political influence. Failing
that, the job might as well be put up to auction and let
the highest bidder have a free hand. In the meantime,
will some member of the House call for a return showing
the amount owing to the Lands Department for arrears of
rent and instalments of C.P. and C.L. in each electorate ?
Mr. Affleck might inquire.
♦
“ Chasselas ” about an urgent want:
A trip through the big Melbourne agricultural
implement manufacturing works sharply emphasises
the urgent necessity for the Commonwealth to manu-
facture its own iron. Old established firms such as
T. Robinson and Co., H. Lennon, and Nicholson and
Morrow are at present straining every nerve to fill
orders for farm machinery for home and outside demand.
One firm alone turns out 14 complete harvesters a week,
besides other implements. All these firms have a vast
amount of machinery ready packed for export to
Argentine and S. Africa. This despite the fact that
they are at the mercy of foreign competitors for their
iron and steel supplies, and that not a single firm in the
Commonwealth manufactures the malleable castings
absolutely necessary to obtain lightness combined with
strength in machinery. The Commonwealth imports
annually iron valued at £6,500,000. To mine the material
and coal necessary to produce this iron, it is computed,
would provide employment for 4500 workmen, and
many more would be required to manufacture the raw
product into rails, girders, sheets, plates, bars, rods,
galvanised iron, and a host of other things. The
£6,500,000 sent away to fatten the importer and pile up
the foreign makers’ millions would be spent amongst our
own workmen, tradesmen, and manufacturers. Land
values would be enhanced, consumption of natural pro-
ducts increased, and the tax per head of population
diminished. The Australian States have fooled away
millions on waterworks, seed wheat, free carriage of stock
on railways, &c., to help the man on the land. They
have also spent thousands in developing other mineral
resources, but the iron that has made the wealth of the
world’s leading countries lies untouched. The iron-
workers have been left out in the cold with nary a bonus,
and it is up to the Australian Parliament to give them
a turn and see if they won’t shape better in the matter
of shooing Cohen off the premises than the much-pam-
pered, much bonus-fed cockie.
• ♦
Under Federation, no State is entitled to fix
up its own customs tariff, and there is the same
reason for not giving it the right to fix up its
industrial laws. Victoria, unable to protect
itself by tariff against Tasmania, nevertheless
finds its industries exposed to the unfair
competition of the latter State, where there
isn’t any factory or wages legislation, and
where factory girls can be had for ss. a week.
Unless the same authority which has taken over
control of the Customs has control also of indus-
trial legislation, the meanest and most inhumanly
selfish State is thus given a start. And then
something else happens. In Tasmania, where
an Industrial Arbitration Bill has just been
thrown out, it was openly pleaded that the
State ought to be prepared to “take advan-
tage of its geographical situation.” “ They
have thrown open their markets to us, and
they have tied their hands,” these mean Tas-
manians say in effect; “now, if we aren’t so
foolish as to tie ours, we shall have a fine time.”
This appeal to the island’s cupidity—this holding-
out of a prospect of a good time —not only had a
great deal to do with the rejection of the Arbitra
tion Bill, but it is also being used against those
who might support such a Bill in the future ; and
thus the whole democratic cause in the island is
thrown back. But that concerns only the island.
What concerns the other part of the Common-
wealth is that, having agreed upon inter state
freetrade, it has put itself at the mercy of any one
State which chooses to be a blackleg in industrial
concerns. And, since that puts a strain on
Federalism, it ought to be ended with all possible
speed ; and it can be ended by handing over to
the same authority which controls the Customs
control also of industrial legislation.
*
Some cold dry figures that have appeared in print
about the public service vote of Victoria create a
sudden suspicion that Premier Irvine is a
monumental ass. He deprived the public servants
of their share in the ordinary franchise because
they were supposed to exercise an absurdly unfair
influence in returning State members, and he gave
them instead three Assembly members of their
own. Therefore it is dead certain that in future
they will have three members ; and now that the
number of public servants in each electorate has
been published they prove to be so much more
scattered than was popularly believed, that
it is very doubtful if they could have returned
three representatives under ordinary conditions.
In Fitzroy, for instance, there are 88 State
servants to 4946 ordinary electors; Bruns-
wick, 200 to 4866 ; Carlton, 209 to 4953;
Abbotsford, 160 to 4746, and so on. Irvine
seems to have been full of the worst inten-
tions, but whether he has succeeded in carrying
them out is very doubtful. In a House of 65, three
members who are good stayers often count for a
good deal; and on hot nights, when there is a bare
quorum, and the affluent Tory has gone away to
pub ice on his head, they often count for a great
deal.

The appearance of that charming opera,
“Fra Diavolo,” at Sydney Royal, on Saturday
night, was not hailed by an enormous crush. In
fact, everyone who had money to spend on music
had apparently gone to hear the divine Ada at
the Town Hall, and a dreary waste of empty
seats cast a gloom over the gay freebooter and his
environment of rock and greenwood tree. Still,
genius will tell, and the beauty of Auber’s music
made bright spots—when the music got a show.
The company worked hard, but the thing
was clearly beyond its capabilities. Henry
Hallam was the Fra, but Henry’s once service-
able tenor is getting frayed at the edges and
shows signs of weakness up the centre, where-
fore there were regrets for what might have
been. Miss May Beatty strove with the
part of Zerlina, the pretty daughter of the host,
who is betrothed to one man and is desperately in
love with another, and though the bright little
girl wrestled as energetically as did Jacob on a
momentous occasion, she had not the same luck
as the ancient Israelite. Nothing she could do
could atone for lack of voice, although the way
she undressed and got into her nightgown, after
revealing an excellent pair of dainty pink “limbs,”
was highly approved. That episode lit up the whole
piece. It shed tranquility over the ruffled mind,
even when Lauri repeated with wearisome mono-
tony his ridiculous “You do make me so wild.”
The other bright spots included Piddock as
Brigadier Lorenzo, which he acted well and sang
better. Lempriere Pringle was associated with
Lauri as Beppo, and his Beppo is something to be
remembered, and the excellence of it gave Beppo
an importance that would have astonished Auber
could he have seen the great basso in the part.
But the brightest spot in the show arrived when
the curtain stuck, and the audience cheered wildly,
and the only Jew in the D.C. commenced to make
a book and plunged on its corning down at the i
third try, and was completely broke by it staying
up till the fifth, when he adjourned to the bar to
pay up.

“ Fra Diavolo ” is here for a very short
stay ; in fact, it will be so nearly dead by the time
these remarks appear in print that the remarks
may as well be short, as all inscriptions and
epitaphs should be. The Musgrove season ends
on Saturday with one performance of the
“Daughter of the Regiment.” After that the
Royal will devote itself to getting ready for J.
C. Williamson’s pantomime of “Sleeping Beauty
and the Beast.”

Miss Ada Crossley ended her journey from
Auckland on Saturday at a time when her
audience for that night’s concert was pouring into
the Town Hall. The prima donna’s constitution
must be as fine as her voice. She had been sick
all the way right to the Heads. Reaching that
psychological point under the shades of evening,
she was fed, dressed in a white and silver concert
robe, hustled on deck, where the health officer
passed her, then dropped into a special steam
launch, rushed up to the quay and straight to
the Hall, where she sang as well as ever before in
her life. “Nearer My God to Thee” (new
setting), with its unusually high vocal passages,
enabled the singer to send her devotional, organ-
like tones much nearer the great white Throne
than in preceding numbers. Name of the song
was simply a statement of fact after Ada had
sent it afloat. Her “Oh, That We Two Were
Maying,” described by an M.L. admirer as
“ better than a sermon by a great divine,”
is a standing favorite, especially with the audi-
ence that is under 30 years of age. Loving, and
the gathering of spring flowers, and the thought
of the final sleep under the churchyard pansies
are very dear to the young and strong, and the
final goal doesn’t sadden them at all—it seems so
far off. “Lost Chord” and “Better Bide a
Wee,” two more of the contralto’s songs, were
worth any money. Messrs. Peterkin, Jacobs, and
Grainger, who arrived a day before the prirna-
donna, were respectively in great voice, fiddle,
and fingers. First had annexed some of the
storm at sea which he had experienced, and let it
out in his “Hmor and Arms.” He was encored
all the time. Percy Grainger and violinist
Jacobs got a triple encore for their “Finale on
Scandinavian Airs,” and the pianist’s other num-
bers were so warmly acknowledged that he will
leave Sydney with a high opinion of its musical
taste.

Friday of this week sees the last of “ A
Country Girl” at Her Majesty’s; that night the
Rawson Exes, will look in and see the lady safely
off the premises. For part of the next week
“The Toreador ” will return, though the Spanish
gentleman will take a night off on Monday to allow
of something extra in the way of a “grand com-
plimentary benefit ” to George Lauri, who by that
time will have finished his 12th year with
J.C.W.’s co. And after all this—well, next week
will be time enough to explain what the bounteous
Miss Jeffries and the beauteous Julius Knight
will do during the holidays.
Sydney had seen “The World Against
Her ” two or three times before William Ander-
son revived it at Sydney Lyceum on Saturday
night, and had labelled it as better finished and
more coherent melodrama than most of them.
The main story, of course, was grown on the
same fruitful tree as the others. Inman, happy
when the curtain rises, is the victim of Lawrence
Dunbar and his hireling villains through about
five acts; but towards the end of the sixth a
southerly springs up, the atmosphere clears,
Inman finds that it was all a mistake,
and he is re-united to Miss Duggan,
whom he had divorced between acts 1 and
2on painfully insufficient evidence. Generally
speaking, Inman isn’t married until late in the
evening, or if he is married it is to some painted
hussy who has already a husband or two on hand ;
and the present experiment of making him
respectably married to begin with is an agreeable
change. This time he is a budding inventor; he
puts in anxious midnight hours probing into the
depths of mechanical things, and doesn’t tell his
wife, who, of course, suspects another cat. Mean-
time, Dunbar, who is Inman’s boss, tries to make
hay with Inman’s wife while hubby is out invent-
ing ; and these two things lead to all the trouble
and the six acts before-mentioned. The old hands
of the Lyceum co. play their old characters in their
usual substantial way ; and Loma Sinclair takes
a child’s part very well indeed. Miss Duggan,
Inman, Carey, and Miss Fergus, with Bailey and
Miss Leighford in much better comedy parts than
melodramas are usually provided with, earn
mention; and so does the mounting. “The
World Against Her” will run till Christmas; on
Boxing night “ The Great World of London ” will
come on.
* *
You can’t, as W. Elton used to say, tell a
sausage by its overcoat, and you can’t tell a melo-
drama by its name. You picture “The Assassin,”
for instance, going round Sydney Criterion with a
dagger always in his sleeve and a writhing corpse
in his wake; and, instead, the assassin turns out
to be the heroine, and there isn’t a streak of
crimson till you’re reaching for your hat and try-
ing to remember what time the last boat leaves.
Pretty often the piece recalls the “French Spy”
—especially in that scene wherein the Russian
Chief-of-Police holds an inquiry into the guilt of
the wronged hero, and at which the proceedings
are hung up while J. P. O’Neill and other
foreigners make nasty remarks about the
alleged Russian way of doing things. The story
i 8 about a Russian Countess who, to avoid
marrying one of those wicked princes of
whom that snowy land (of course there’s a snow
scene) seems full, marries instead a private in the
prince’s regiment, which, as might be expected,
doesn’t turn out good business for the private.
This story is supplemented by a shocking amount
of alleged “comic relief.” Almost half of the
characters have, in fact, nothing whatever to do
with the yarn, and they fill whole scenes. Even
the Amurrican young woman (rich, of course) who
is roaming around St. Petersburg looking for a
husband (about the only thing, it seems, that the
U.S. can’t produce), and who has almost as much
“ fat ” as the heroine, has only the flimsiest
connection with the story In this part Miss Irby
Marshall made her first professional appearance,
and a full house gave her a warm welcome.
Chiefly, it is a “comic relief” part, and
shows little or nothing of what the new-
comer may be worth in serious business. All
it proves is that she has a good presence,
an easy manner, and plenty of confidence.
The heavier part of the countess is capitally
taken by Miss Gresham, and Stanford (the
wicked prince) and Hesford (his father) are the
other conspicuous successes of a long cast. The
mounting is unusually effective. The piece will
probably run until Charles Holloway puts on
“Why Woman Sins,” his Christmas attraction.

Frogs’ feet, chameleons’ tongues, and
toads’ heads are nowon the bill at Sydney Tivoli;
and those light-minded people who go to see
Jenny Grey do the “splits” remain to take a
lesson in natural science. Probably this is the
first result of the manager having been made a
J.P. ; as a pillar of the State, he knows that the
enlightened citizen cannot live by the “splits”
alone. The innards of the frog’s foot, &c., are
exposed by means of the micro-biograph, a new
and very remarkable application of the old cine-
matograph idea to microscopic subjects. Winton,
M‘Ginty, cricket and election jokes, Ernest Fitts,
Whitburn and others are thrown in ; and the
Cirnocs are coming.

“ L. Paul ” writes :
The production of Auber’s “Fra Diavolo ” once more
in Sydney makes one wonder why the modern manager
does not revive more of that Frenchman’s work. “ Fra”
is about the only opera of Auber’s that keeps the stage,
and it is by no means his best. “ Masaniello,” the over-
ture to which is the darling of concert-room orchestras,
is most charming, and was until recently in the reper-
toire of most grand opera companies touring the English
provinces. Perhaps being a grand opera is what is the
matter with it; and the same with “Gustavus III.,”
whose plot is identical with Verdi’s “ Un Ballo in Mas-
chera.” “ Gustavus III.” figured in the London Royal
Italian repertoire in 1851, and for a time more than held
its own. The ballet music alone won it a European repu-
tation. No more charming comic opera than “ The
Grown Diamonds ” could be wished, and this work
in its Italian dress for several seasons showed
Patti as La Oaterina in one of her fine im-
personations. The “Domino Noir” and “The Am-
bassadress,” though resembling each other in style,
do not contain two melodies alike, and it is this wealth of
bright, gay melody, occasionally melting into tenderness,
which constitutes Auber’s chief charm and speciality.
Though “II Prodigo,” a lyric version of the Prodigal
Son, figured frequently in the fifties at the London
theatres, a fat-headed Lord Chamberlain in the nineties
forbade a dramatic “Joseph of Ca "
because it emanated from Australia. ftn( j
was Eugene Scribe; these two were the fh • ' ks
Sullivan of the fifties. English versions o i allt heir works
are in existence, and if it pays to revive Fra Diavolo,
why not continue to work the Auber vein r

Nothing of intense human interest has
lately happened in Melbourne’s theatrical world
—except an accident to Miss Maud Jeffnes
ankle, or instep. This calamity prevented Miss
J. from decorating the last nights of the BOM-
caire ” revival with her bounteous presence, but
Miss Pendennis served as a. well-grown sub-
stitute for the more emotional actress, and
the path of Julius Knight was strewn _with
roses and raptures as usual. The saccharine Bath-
bun comedy, coupled with “ At the Telephone,
was finally withdrawn. last Wednesday, after
which came one consecutive reappearance of Miss
Jeffries as Katusha in “ Resurrection,” where the
gaol ladies lap spirituous liquor from the floor
with their tongues. “The Eternal City on
Friday and Saturday brought the season at Her
Majesty’s to a close. . The advertisement bade
Julius farewell, and many girls wept inwardly
when the final curtain cut him off from observa-
tion. “ The Country Girl ” comes to pass at Her
Majesty’s on Boxing Night; meanwhile J.C.W. s
establishment will swell the ranks of unemployed
playhouses.

At the Melbourne Royal they are still
proceeding with “The Great Millionaire,” and
the demand for that important melodrama retains
much of its early vigor. Bland Holt is now left
in sole possession of public patronage, as far as
dramais concerned, thereforehisthreatened change
of programme will not occur before Xmas. More-
over, the new show is not to be what he had in view a
month ago. The joy in store is coming Along
under the title of “ A Desperate Game, and
Bland, with commendable audacity, describes it
as an Australian Anecdote. A Special Seasonable
Scenario is being prepared for the anecdote by
John Brunton, who has no false pride about him.
If Bland were to describe a six-act melodrama as
a casual remark, or a local wheeze, Brunton would
not consider his scenery insulted.

The remarkable Cirnoc and his collection
of handcuffs are leaving Melbourne Opera House
this week, also the disappearance of the Dumonds
is nearly due. Vulcana the strong lady, and
Atlas the athlete are said to be coming next
Saturday, but managerial predictions are worth
nothing in Melbourne these times. As likely as
not the newcomers—if they come at all —will be
Juno and Perseus, or Helen and Paris. It’s quite
time we did get a Helen and Paris on the Rickards
bill.

Ada Crossley will give three farewell
ballad concerts at Melbourne Town Hall on
Thursday, Friday and Saturday of this week, the
Friday fixture to be a charity matinee, and the
evening concerts in aid-o’-Crossley. The soulful
contralto on these occasions will sing songs sacred
and otherwise, and in the case of the Lost Chord
the disreputable municipal organ may have the
honor of supplying an accompaniment, if its
internal arrangements are duly certificated by
a doctor of music. Apd there is to be a
further triumph of Miss Crossley. On Xmas
Night she will take part in the Philharmonic
Society’s performance• of “The Messiah,” which
is Melbourne’s oldest musical event.

Many other things are appointed for Dec.
25 —for instance, there is to be a Sacred Festival
of Boffard at the Opera House—but sundry
earnest references to these matters are reserved
for next week’s Wednesday Bulletin.

About the Slap, case : .
The case of Madame Slapoffski v. George Musgrove
even if the present decision should he upset on
appeal, is a caution to managers who accept a
“star” performer’s services without settling the terms
of payment—if there ever was, or is, or could be
another manager so unbusinesslike as Musgrove was
in this instance. Madame claimed that her salary for 21
weeks of work in “The Fortune-Teller” and “The
Serenade” should have been £59 per week, whereas
Musgrove claimed that, in offering her £25 a week
soon after the work started, he had practically
given the artist the option of continuing the job on
his terms or dropping it altogether. She did neither. She
continued to do the work whilst refusing the proffered
payment, and the relations between the parties remained
friendly. Justice Madden summed up in favor of the
employee—“ Although Mr. and Mrs. Slapoffski frequently
met Mr. Musgrove after the first week of the opera and
she had refused to accept the £25, nothing was said about
her salary. Plaintiff said that Mr. Musgrove should have
spoken about it and plaintiff was unquestionably right,
because it was for the person who accepted the
services to say what he was going to pay.” That Mus-
grove had at the outset instructed his treasurer to tender
payment of £25 a week was a fact which weighed nothing
in the Judge’s opinion. Heleftitfor the jury to say whether
Madame Slapoffski wanted too much, or her manager
offered too little, and they found that the error was £l5
on one side and £lO on the other— i.e., they gave the
plaintiff £35 a week for the 21 weeks in dispute. But
this was not the whole of the case. Defendant Musgrove
made a counter claim against Madame Slapoffski for
breach of agreement. She had thrown up her job
without giving him any sort of notice, and had
injured his business by thus putting him “ in a hole."
Justice Madden instructed the jury to dismiss the
counter claim, unless they thought that plaintiff had
actually agreed to accept £25 a week. The fact of her
having worked for 21 weeks without any promise of
receiving more than £25 a week from Musgrove did not
disentitle her to break her hazy “agreement” with
impunity—said the learned Madden. So the verdict
went against G.M. on both issues. In addition to the
money admittedly due to her, Madame Slap, got judgment
for £2lO with costs—the costs to be taxed. And when
the costs in a long-drawn-out law suit have been taxed,
how much does the winning side get out of a verdict for
£2lO ? And supposing there should be an appeal, and all
this law happens to be upset, with more costs. Costs are
a very massive animal, and give very little satisfaction
on either side.
#* * *
Madden, 0.J., Victoria’s corseted Lieut.”
Governor, and lawyers Isaacs, Duffy, and
Coldham, managed to turn the Slapoffski-
Musgrove case into a musical farce without the
orchestra. For this, Madden, C.J., as stage
manager, was primarily responsible, whioh seems
wofully inconsistent in one who, with corsets, glossy
hat and beautifully-seamed trousers, strives so
strenuously to maintain the terrible dignity of the
law. Insumming up the Judge condemned
himself out of his own mouth. He remarked,
“ The action, stripped of its extraneous charms,
which have not been few, is a simple one. Cer-
tainly it has taken a long time, but a great many
bright and clever people have set their wits
against each other, and as the jury and I have
not to pay for it, we have not much to complain
about.” This appears to be a justification tor
introducing extraneous matter into a law case, so
long as it is entertaining and the judge and jury
have not to foot the bill. If his Honor s point is
carried to its logical conclusion, it would be
justifiable to interlard any law case with chapters
from Mark Twain or Dooley, or acts from rmero,
Grundy, or Jones. Mr. Madden ought to be called
upon to pay for the time wasted on the ‘extrane-
ous charms,” as he styles them. Apart altogether
from the expenses of the parties, there is the little
matter of £3OOO a year between the taxpayers and
Madden, O.J.

William Anderson is playing a December
season, at Adelaide Royal, with ‘‘Greed of Gold
and “The Shadow of Night.” The latter play,
in recognition of the fact that night is just the
time when there are next to no shadows, intro-
duces a burning petroleum store, which casts any
number of them. Adelaide dress-circle patrons
invariably treat this sort of thing as if it didn t
exist, but the other parts of the house do it full
justice. Acting good, mounting excellent, ihe
weather-clerk got heavily on to a harmless, recent
remark of The Bulletin that the Adelaide
climate in summer is well suited for continentals,
he temporarily abolished the first of these
entertainments, and gave the second a cold, gusty
night. There are more to come, however.

THE BULLETIN XMAS EDITION was SOLD
OUT at 11 a.m. on the DAY OF PUBLICATION.
Although a heavy rush had been anticipated, the

are now complaining of being unable to obtain
increased or supplementary supplies will please
remember that they were advised by circular to
forward orders not later than 23rd November to
ensure delivery. All orders received by that date
were filled, and it is quite impossible to supply
many of those which were received afterwards.

The November returns do not improve the
States’ financial figures tor the year as far as it has gone.
The Commonwealth had to make large payments on
account of the naval tribute, so that the States got back
much less than usual. The revenue figures for the
month were :
Revenue Revenue
November, 1902. November, 1903. Decrease.

Tasmania .. 70,181 79,974 9,/93
South Australia does not furnish monthly returns.
Apart from Commonwealth refunds (Customs duties
chiefly) the N.S.W. revenue was £6459 less than for >ov.,
1992. Land and miscellaneous revenue was better, but
railway receipts were £14,835 worse. The “ break-up o
the drought ” takes a long while to show itself in these
fio-ures. The Nov., 1902, figures in Queensland were
swollen by land receipts; apart from that item the
returns are only £10,117 worse, in spite of the fact that
£52 474 less was received from the Commonwealth.
Except as to the Commonwealth refund the Victorian
returns are also generally better than they were 12
months ago. .
As far as the year has gone and the figures are
available, here are the aggregate revenue returns (Tas-
mania’s year begins on Jan. 1; the others on July 1):

Exclusive of land resumptions (included in the above
the N.S.W. loan expenditure for the first five months of
this year was £686,351 as against £1,117,956 during the
same part of last year. This is an improvement; but,
apart from the resumptions, the loan expenditure has
still been at the rate of nearly a million and three-
quarters a year, not to mention the huge deficit on
revenue account. *

(а) New Zealand.—The Assets Board lost £7117 on
sales ; and £15,001 was written off. The bank had the use
of £2,000,000 of State funds at 4 per cent.
(б) Australasia.—£3o,ooo was written off.
(c) Q.N.—Repaid Government £3OOO, and private de-
positors £6000; written off £9660. The bank holds
£378,331 of State funds (repayable 1921 at latest) with-
out interest.
(and) Royal of Melbourne.—This and other Vic. co.’s were
this year called on to pay income tax.
(e) E.S. & A. —£1828 profit was made on repurchase of
deposits.
(/) Ballarat.—£2so written off premises.

gency account.”
(h) Commercial of Aus.—Capital written down during
the year, so that a comparison of profit per cent, would
be misleading.
(k) L0nd0n.—£368,272 now written off capital.

In the matter of earnings per cent, of share-
holders’ funds (capital and reserves) the two Maoriland.
banks stand at the top of the list as they did a year ago.
The Australasia, Westralia, and Commercial of Tasmania
move up ahead of the Q.N. The Commercial of Sy r dnev,
City, National (Melb,), National (Tas.), and North Queens-
land also move up. The Australasia and Royal (Melb.)
have increased their dividends ; in no ease has a dividend
been reduced. In proportion to profits, and excluding
the Bank of N.Z. and the A.J.S., where special circum-
stances exist, the Westralia has added most largely to
reserves, 58 per cent, of the profits ; then the National of

The reserves are made up as follows Reserve fund,
■ u ’ s, ' ecial reserve to cover possible loss in realising
the Planet Society’s assets, £IOOB ; reserve against pro-
perty sold on terms, £6213 ; and undivided profit, £1936.
Of the profit stated above only £BO4I is shown as such in
the profit and loss account; the balance results from sales
of property on terms. On the realisation of the 1 lanet s
assets there has apparently been a loss, the reserve held
against this having been reduced from £2054 to £IOOB.
This is shown as a writing-off of £1046. The progress
shown is still remarkable, even though some more of the
smaller reserves should have to be written down. The
Fourth Victoria, which lived through all the troubles of
the early nineties and paid its debts, is now increasing
its business pretty rapidly ; in the 12 months the deposits
have grown from £i08,544 to £145,827, and on the
other side its loans on mortgage and balances due under
contract have increased from £155,190 to £191,028.
Practically the whole of the deposits, as well as its own
funds, are locked up in mortgages, balances due, or free-
hold property ; its liquid assets, in fact, consist only of
£2331 cash, and presumably the dividend would absorb
that. This is, no doubt, the way to make profits while
things are going: well; but, in a country where they don’t
always go well, it is risky. #
Some N.S.W. court proceedings the other day
gave foreign insurance co.’s trading in Australia the
worst advt. for a year or two. An Australian co., the
North Queensland, had taken a risk on a sugar cargo in a
Dutch ship. It applied to an English co.—the oldest, or
one of the oldest, of them—for re-insurance. A cover-
note was issued by the English co., and three weeks
afterwards the vessel was reported lost. The N.Q.
claiming on the note, the English co. pleaded,
among other things, that its Sydney manager’s
power-of-attorney did not authorise him to insure
sugar; and the Australian company was non-
suited on that ground. _ So, apparently, it is
necessary before any premium is paid in to the Australian
office of any English or other foreign co. to. see the
manager’s power of attorney. Or the manager might
paste it on the shingle on which the co..hangs out its
sign. Why a respectable English co. should employ a
manager here who can’t be relied upon to see that the
business is confined within the limit of his authority is
difficult to understand.
* • • •
Some of the methods of the fivepence-in-the-£
1.0. F. alleged insurance concern have transpired in the
Victorian Assembly. Peacock, Premier when the request
was made that the affairs of the concern should be
officially inquired into, admits that he took a policy,
but asserts that he is paying for it. It is a very small
policy, and the fact that Peacock took it isn’t any guaran-
tee that he believed the concern sound. Peacock used
to be prepared to become a member of almost anything—
that was mainly how he got into Parliament and finally
into office. But even if be is paying for his policy he
doesn’t come out of the business any too well, for he
admits that he took from Dr. Montague, the Red
Indian’s agent, £SO to hand to a member for
the latter’s election expenses. The fact that the
money was refused doesn’t make things any better
for the 1.0. F.; that it was offered shows the
methods the society adopts. Also it shows that Peacock
knew what its methods were, and still stuck to it., The
wily Red Indian, it seems, made George. Turner its
solicitor very earl}’ in the proceedings ; afterwards he
took a policy and some sort of an honorary office. But
after the disclosure of the society’s methods Turner cuts
his connection with the concern—a step which The
Bulletin urged him to take long ago. Presumably
Turner didn’t know the sort of company he was in.
• * * •
N.S.W. Lands Department’s report shows that,
as the result of the reappraisements which were con-
tinued throughout last year, conditional purchases, home-
stead selections, conditional leases and settlement leases
for which the holders had agreed to pay £3,933,534 were
revalued at £2,409,521. That is to say, the State wrote
off, in respect to these comparatively few holdings,
£1,524,013. And this includes very little of that part of
the country—the far west—which has depreciated most.
At the end of 1896, N.S.W. had still £12,381,760 to collect
from its conditional purchasers. At the end of 1900, the
amount due had fallen to £10,305,902. With the ordinary
decrease and the writings-off it must be now down to
about £8,000,000. A large source of revenue bids fair to
fall through very shortly.

How the Australian tariff is ruining Sydney :
In the July-Sept. quarter of 1901, under the George Reid
tariff, the exports of boots and shoes amounted to
£10,354 ; in the corresponding part of 1902, they had
reached £18,445 ; this year, £22,248. In two year 3 the
tariff has thus more than doubled the exports—to say
nothing of what it has done for the goods for home use.

Over £200,000 of rents and purchase instal-
ments, mostly in connection with Western (N.S.W.)
lands, is overdue 18 months and more. This amount is
independent of money advanced through the Advances
to Settlers Board.

The Owe’See Government is finding out that
it isn’t all beer and circus to be a slum landlord. There
were 434 residences in the resumed properties that were
handed over to the Harbor Trust. Of these 106 had to
be pulled down ;95 times the bailiff has, so far, been put
in ; and even when the rent has been collected, just upon
20 per cent, of it has gone in “maintenance and repairs.”
* * • •
South Australia, whose Parliament, the other
day, cut down the land-tax on the plea that the money
wasn’t wanted, is now sending its Treasurer out with a
small-tooth rake and authority to offer 4 per cent, for the
loan of a few pounds for a year or two.

The proposed Federal bonus on cotton recalls
the fact that some Cairns (Q.) growers are reported to be
making good progress in the propagation of a perennial
plant, said to possess the longest and strongest cotton
fibre in the world. On this subject Mr. David Thomatis
(an ex-Victorian), now at Caravonica plantation, writes :
“ The Italian spinners offered me BJd per lb. at Genoa for
6000 bolls, but I have not had time to grow this quantity.
They will give me even 9d. per lb. when I have the stuff
for sale. From Germany, France and Hungary come
demands for Caravonica cotton. Cotton culture of this
variety will pay handsomely when grown by' white
families. It will be the largest industry of tropical
Australia and New Guinea, and could be made to supply
England. There are millions of acres in Northern
Queensland, the Northern Territory and New Quine*
admirably suited for the industry.”
• * « *
Re that “quaint person named
Craig.” Wonderful, isn't it, that for over 50 years, or
since 1852, when Dr. Lang wrote “Freedom and
Independence for the Golden Lands of Australia ”
in which he showed that cotton could be grown along
the coast for 300 miles, at prices, according to quality,
ranging from 6d. to 2s. 6d. per lb.—no, private enter-
prise has tackled growing it, except, perhaps, the fitful
effort made in Queensland when the Government gave a
bonus. Cotton was successfully grown about Ipswich, but
when the bonus was knocked off the tired farmer knocked
off also. And if cotton could not seduce private enter-
prise at from 6d. to 2s. 6d. per lb. with plenty of
land, and labor at £2O per annum as quoted by Dr.
Lang, what chance would there be now with cotton at a
few pence per lb., and when even coolie or Kanaka labor
would cost nearly as much as white labor did in ’52, and
with land dearer and taxation heavier ? The cry is all
bunkum.
* ■' * * *
“Ake” about a M.L. bank: Seddon has been
requested to set up a Royal Commission to inquire into
the liquidation of the Colonial Bank. Some inquiry is
certainly needed. The bank went into liquidation in
1895. The liquidators received £132,000 cash from the
Bank of New Zealand ; then the bank’s other accounts
were put into three sections, set down as capable of
realising fully £270,000, £65,000, and £40,000 respectively’,
making a total stated to be available for disbursement of
£507,000. A div. of 10s. per share accounted for £103,000,
and a later div. of Is. per share for • £IO,OOO.
This was in 1895. The liquidation continued until
matters were handed over to the official assignee
in 1901, in pursuance of a special amendment of the
Companies Aot, 1882, introduced by the Seddon Govern-
ment. All that time it was unknown how the liquida-
tion was being conducted. Now the shareholders find
that there is nothing left to disburse, and they want to
know what became of the £400,000 that was said to.be in
the liquidator’s hands in 1895. The Petitions Committee,
to which they applied, recommends a Royal Commission.
But M.L. Royal Commissions are generally the grazing
ground of political hangers-on; and, if this alleged
£400,000 is to be traced, Seddon must appoint a Commis-
sion whose members are both impartial and disinterested.
This is all the more necessary as one of Seddon’s col-
leagues was a debtor of the bank. Just at present, it
looks as though Seddon will talk at large, and the Royal
Commission will look wise and scratch its empty head,
and pocket its fees, and that there the matter will end.

Stated that, in consequence of a “ring” being
formed in Sydney to keep down the price of wheat
(which doesn’t necessarily mean that the price of bread
will also be kept down), farmers in different centres are

The paid capital is £9OOO ; on this, combined with the
reserves as at the commencement of the half-year, the
return was equal to £l2 15s. 3d. per cent, per annum.
The commissions rather more than pay all expenses. The
co.’s own assets are chiefly Perth property; and rents
and interest show a return of £ll Bs. per cent, on the
shareholders’ funds. The balance of trust accounts
(£159,101) which, contrary to the general practice, ate
shown in the co.’s own balance-sheet, are represented
mainlv by first mortgages (£117,324). The trustee busi-
ness is growing steadily ; in three years the balances have
moved up from £98,273 to £159,101.

Block 14, which, in proportion to its profits,
has spent more in plant than any other of the principal
Broken Hill co’s, will be the first to use a chemical pro-
cess for turning out a zinc product. The Central (Sul-
phide Corporation) has for some time been making a zinc
product, but it is using a magnetic separator. The Aus-
tralian Metal Cos., which works on purchased ore, mainly
from Block 10, also uses magnets. But the worst of all
these processes is that the product is worth little to Aus-
tralia ; it is nearly all shipped for final treatment in
Europe, and it is in this final treatment that most of the
money is spent, in either coal, coke, or labor. The Sul-
phide Corporation has a smelting plant at Cockle Creek,
Newcastle, for reducing the product (really a concentrate)
to metal; but, in the absence of a bonus, the industry
has never been able to get fairly on its feet, and practi-
cally the whole plant is now idle.
* * • *
In the tussle over the zinc patents the B.H.
Prop, has scored another point, the Vic. Patents Com-
missioner having decided that the co. has not infringed
Potter’s patent and is entitled to one of its own. Potter’s
process requires the application of heat after the pulped
ore has been immersed in the acid-water, while the B.H.
Prop.’s doesn’t, and the Commissioner appears to have
been much impressed with that difference.
• « • •
The Carmichael-Bradford desulphurising pro-
cess, about which nothing has been heard for a while, is
stirring again at Broken Hill. The B.H. Prop, directors
watched tests at the Port Pirie works, made partly with
the object of ascertaining the price at which sulphuric
acid can be produced ; for they are interested in sulphuric
acid in connection with zinc extraction. It is said that
the stuff can be made for 15s. per ton ; if the figure is
correct it is far below anything previously done anywhere
else. Cheap sulphuric acid will go a long way towards
solving the zinc-extraction difficulty ; Prof. Schnabel,
who was imported from Germany 10 or 12 years ago to
make experiments with sulphides, was only barred from
recommending a sulphuric acid process by the price of
the acid. The B.H. Prop, will put up at once an experi-
mental acid-saving plant at the sintering works, a few
miles outside Broken Hill.

relating to lead discovery, was misread in 8., Dec. 3)
saved last half-year 38'63 per cent, of the silver in the
ore, and 64 - 87 per cent, of the lead ; the zinc was, of
course, turned to practically no account —the vast bulk
of it was simply put into the dumps. Taking the lead at
£ll 55., silver at 2s. 2d., and zinc at £2l, this was the
result:—

Broken Hill, after its famine, has a flood.
Everything there that will hold water is full, or there-

Behind the weir is a sheet of water two miles long, and
in places a mile wide. But most of it will evaporate ;
the call on it will be small for many months, and 1904

The principal recent developments have been most in
favor of Queen Central (owing to the discoveries in the

latter, however, is in very low financial water, and is

From Anakie, the Central Queensland gem-
field, 199 miles from Rockhampton : “ Till within the
last two years our gems only fetched corundum prices,
but we are getting a better price now. The field has a
population of about 120 miners, 20 women and 30
children. Sapphires (yellow, blue and green), zircons,
and one or two rubies have been got here and good prices
obtained for them. Mr. B. Dunstan, Acting Government
Geologist, showed us some he had cut the last time he
visited the field, one in particular being a yellow sapphire,
for which he refused £ls per carat —hot a bad price for
■corundum,’ as ‘ H.S.R.’ (B. Nov. 5) calls our gems.
Two or three diamonds have also been found. If
■ H.S.R.’ cares to make inquiries amongst the Melbourne
and Sydney jewellers no doubt they can show him many
valuable Anakie gems.” .

total for the eleven months to £1,838,071. For December
Great Boulder Prop, will pay £66,025; Cosmopolitan,
£20,000; and Lancefield, £360, increasing the ye?Vs total
to £1,924,056. Final dividends may be looked for from
Oroya-Brown Hill, Associated, Sons of Gwalia, Peak Hill,
and possibly Golden Link. Should these eventuate, the
grand total will be well over the two-million mark, and
may even establish a record.

A deposit of blue clay just struck at Mount
Lofty, behind Adelaide, is supposed to have a remarkable
commercial value, and local experts reckon it equal to
anything they have used when in Staffordshire. S.A.
Telegraph Department promises to take its insulators
from this source, provided they pass the electrical test;
ab present all insulators come from Germany, but the
article now locally produced is in appearance fully equal

“ When it is considered that the Colonial Mutual Life

highly gratifying to all concerned. We have no hesita-
tion in congratulating the management on the excellent
results of the year’s work.”*

It is recognised that much of the loss in con-
centration is due to the feeding at the same time of many
different sizes of ore particles, and while to a certain
extent the loss is obviated by the installation of hydraulic
classifiers, the constant addition of volume of water in
the various stages of classification practically always
entails a heavy loss in fine mineral carried away in tee
overflow, thus, though a more or less regularly graded
product is obtained and the percentage of saving over the
concentrators, calculated on the value of the material
fed on to them, has been increased, yet the aggregate loss
has not been diminished. The McDermott Sizer differs
from other classifiers from the fact that the separation
into various sizes is effected by means of a submerged
screen. Careful tests have proved there is an absolute
freedom of movement of the particles under water, and
that the pulp can pass in succession through a series of
screens e? «h finer than the preceding, thus permitting
effective separation into sizes most admirably adapted for
close concentration work. The Austral Otis Engineering
Company of South Melbourne are the Agents and Sole
Manufacturers of the “ McDermott Sizer.”*

British manufacturers have been beaten in an
open competition by an Australian engineering firm. We
have ascertained that the Mond Gas Cos. of Staffordshire
have accepted the tender of Mephan Ferguson, of Mel-
bourne, for the supply of about 13 miles of Ferguson’s
Patent Lockingbar Steel Pipes, from 18 inches to 36 inches
diameter. The machinery for manufacturing these pipes
has all been made at Ferguson’s General Engineering
Works, Footscray, and shipped to Tipton, in Staffordshire,
where the branch works are being erected. The same
firm have also erected engineering and pipe works at
Wanganui, New Zealand, and have contracted to supply
the Wanganui Borough Council with about 20 miles of

| lEven the Chinaman seems to have a low opinion
C;his violent fellow-countrymen as workers. This is a
Vic. mining item “The happy relations which charac-
terised the inaugural ceremony last week at the China-
man’s claim, Wooragee, took an unpleasant turn on
Friday evening. Mr. Anderson, the manager, ordered a
Chinese off the works. This led to an emeute among the
16 Chinese employed, who attacked the manager with
shovels and a crowbar. Two of the leaders attempted to
drown Mr. Anderson in a dam close by the works, and
only for the timely arrival of a number of Europeans on
the scene serious consequences might have resulted. The
police from Beechworth and Yackandandah were sum-
moried, and .this had the effect of quieting the Chinese.
Meanwhile somh of the directors arrived from Melbourne,
and an inquiry was held on Sunday, and it is expected
that for the future only Europeans will be employed,
notwithstanding that the claim belongs to a Chinese
syndicate—Shi Geen and Ah Catt and Cos., of Mel-
bourne.”

HUSBAND : “ Oh, I can't take you away next
week; I’d lose my vote.”
WIFE : “Well if you don’t, I’ll vote Freetrade,
and you’ll lose it just the same.”
A new development of Prohibition. At
liquor-barred Ashburton (M.L.), some recent
drunks admitted that they had been taking yeast.
It appears to be a paralysing concoction, and the
yeast-fiend has to betaken home in a wheelbarrow
every time.
A man turned up in Adelaide the other
day and said he had invented a resurrection
machine. If a live corpse were buried, he said,
and happened not to be dead, the slightest motion
would set the machinery going, and bells at the
top of the grave would ring persistently, and
naturally people would know then that the
deceased wasn’t defunct, and they would come
and dig him up.

“ Marat ” : Looked up a small lane off
George-street t’other day, and saw a man posing
bareheaded, while an-
other sketched him in a
large and greasy sketch-
book. Went up to in-
vestigate, and found the
study was a defeated
candidate at a recent
election, who told me
he was being sketched
for The Bulletin. The v i
artist made an awful
botch of the sketch, but
said it didn’t matter, as it
was just an outline study
for him to work upon. The
defeated candidate asked
him to put a silk hat and
pince-nez in the finished draw-
ing, as lots of people would
recognise him. The artist
promised, and we adjourned to
the nearest hotel, the sitter
shouting. The artist told me he
never signed any Bjlletin work,
although he did thousands of sketches. Spoke
patronisingly of “Hop,” Alf. Vincent and
Lindsay. Said that we would see the drawing in
The Bulletin, which would be published the
following day. Then, after swallowing his beer,
he left post-haste for your office.

Melbourne was startled the other Satur-
day by the appearance of a new morning news-
paper, the People’s Daily, as a thunderbolt out
of the blue, without any previous notice what-
ever. There are said to be two others coming.
The first of a few disinterested observations that
occurs to the public is the difficulty of doing with-
out cablegrams, as this new paper does. It cannot
even comment on cablegrams, while they are
fresh. The copyright prevents this. A cablegram
has about one day’s life secured to it, as property.
Newspaper proprietors sleep a little on this right,
but they don’t sleep much. When the Melbourne
papers got separate cables the Argus even stopped
the Hekald from commenting, except on its own
wires.

Dr. Reddall, giving evidence recently in
Sydney Divorce Court, shocked his Divorce
Honor by saying that women are much more
hysterical now than 20 years ago. It was thought
some years ago that the increasing tendency to
outdoor life and athletic exercises would reduce
hysteria, and that position was strongly taken up
by medical men who championed women’s right
to belabor the earth with their athletic feet. Now
doctors begin to differ again. Doctors differ so
much that it is generally necessary to pay three
of them —two for differing, and the third for giving
a casting vote.

“ J.M‘C.” tells about his first job :
When I left school I answered an advertisement from one
G. Sorabjee who wanted a small boy with all the cardi-
nal virtues, the
disposition of a
cow, the streng th
of an ox, and
modest views on
salary. There
were three other
members of the
boy tribe on the
ma t when I
arrived one
with a big collar
and specs., an-
other with no
collar and his
dinner, and a
third with his
mother. The boy
whose mother
will come to help
him get a job is
guilty of the
refinement o f
cruelty. The
other kids reck-
on him a black-
leg, and they are
right, for the
woman will al-
ways cut the
wages to get the
place. I had a
good position on
the rails, and got
the job. Had
sometroubleper-
suading the
boy’s mother to. go away, and the youth with the
dinner wanted to fight me. Wages were 2s. 6d. a week
when biz. was good, and, when nothing was doing, a half
share of the takings. The boss was a Hindoo masseur,
and, I think, an ex-coolie, with all that creature’s
antipathy to work. He would send me over the road for
fruit and watch from an upstairs window to see I did not
help myself. I blew up his gas stove one day, but he for-
gave me this, as well as when I looked in casually while a
lady patient was unrobing. His frugality was too much
for me in the end, and I left when he paid me ljd. for 10
hours overtime. He said it was pro rata, and I said it was
swindling. He carried his Asiatic methods into wider
spheres later on, and is now using his magic powers on
solid bluestone out at Pentridge.
“J.D.”: A religious landlady, who owns
a dilapidated terrace in a Sydney suburb, makes a
point of asking ladies who wish to become
tenants to produce their marriage-lines.
Four out of her five houses are generally
to let. Agents will not take the letting
of them since a local agent got a broken
head for asking a big lady surrounded by
four youngsters to produce her certificate.
THE COACHMAN WAS A BIT DEAF.
There seems to be no end to the troubles
of that unfortunate Sydney dentist who claims
that he was forcibly married to a lady he didn’t
want at any price, after being foully battered by
her friends. He had to give up his suit for the
annulment of the marriage because he wasn’t
making enough out of the teeth business to pay
law expenses; and then, by way of rubbing it in,
he was arrested on a charge of intending to leave
the State without providing for his wife’s keep.
An interesting question for a law examination
would be: “ Enumerate all the different kinds of
trouble a man may get into with the civil law
through getting married, and supply a complete
list of the costs that may arise in consequence.

The women students of Sydney University
held a “ fete ” one Saturday in aid of the “Bombay
Missionary Settlements.” The B.M.S. is one of
the numerous schemes of Christian Britain for
enlightening the darkness of our dark brudder in
India, and takes the form of despatching white
women from the English Universities to dwell
among the Parsee women. Since 1899 some dozen
have gone out; one has died, two have collapsed
physically and have had to be brought back again,
and there isn’t much information about the rest.
New workers are wanted, and the promoters of
the fete appeal to the Sydney University for
volunteers. Yet the women of Sydney University
should be able to find plenty of scope locally for
any missionary instincts they may have. They
can start by trying to bring Dill Macky and
Cardinal Moran, with their respective followings,
to a Christian frame of mind. When one brand
of Christian calls the other a “ dirty cur” in Par-
liament there is evidently need of local Christian
effort. Meanwhile the Parsee had better be left
alone; he has never called us anything like that.

Herbert Flemming, who has returned to
Australia after a lapse of 13 years as manager of the
Mel. B. Spurr show, brings a large stock of infor-
niation re the Boer War in all its bearings. Flem-
ing left England for S’Africa ten days before the
war broke out, and ran his own dramatic co. at
one town or other all the time the guns were
going. In Bloemfontein he played many weeks
right off the reel—comedy, drama, farce; “Mrs.
Tanqueray ” one night, “Jones ” the next, and so
on, always under the patronage of the blessed
British military authorities. He has the measure
of Boer and Briton. Found a lot of fine, brainy
fellows among the progressive Boers, and a per-
centageof ditto among the officahs from “Home,”
leavening a host of insufferable bounders. Whereas
the average town-bred Boer is progressive, the
average town-bred lieutenant in the British army
is an arrogant Tory ass—and an unprinoipl'* J ass
at that.
“Melb.”: A lady was killed, the other
day, by falling to the pavement from an upper
window at Menzies’ Hotel. Although wealthy,
she was doing some economical laundry-work in
her bedroom. She hung the things economically
out of the window. A miserable cuff dropped to
a lower ledge, and, reaching for it, she met her
fate. Died and left all that money behind her in
the struggle to save a twopenny cuff, and the cuff
was lost after all, and there were also the burial
expenses. Such affairs are bound to occur in
couples, and this was the second one—three days
before, a woman was killed by falling from a
window at South Melbourne. It may be remem-
bered that Mrs. Vezin, the actress, known here
as Mrs. C. Young, was killed in England by fall-
ing from a window. I don’t know what she was
reaching for, but, in most cases, when a woman
falls out of a window she is struggling to get a
good view of a funeral.
Nosea are now being made of paper.
Anvbody who has had the misfortune to lose
his “boko” can have one, beautifully
enamelled, for £l, and they are said to be
very like the real thing. Also they don’t
flush through drink.
The bluest-blooded of European reigning
families—the Hapsburg to wit —seems to be doing
its best to bring monarchical principles into utter
contempt. A succession of royal scandals has
happened within the Austrian regal circle. The
latest story is of a double murder, committed by
Emperor Joseph’s grand-daughter. Getting wind
of her husband’s liaison with an actress —
which was nothing for any princess to
make a fuss about, anyhow—she killed the giddy
charmer, after she had put a fatal bullet
into the faithful flunkey who tried to prevent
her intrusion on the privacy of the lovers. The
Emperor of Austria’s descendant, as it happens,
is of all women in Europe the least entitled to
protest against conjugal infidelity. Her family is
full of it. Her father, Crown Prince Rudolph,
was officially stated to have committed suicide in
a rural castle some years ago. There was a woman
ill the case, and the details of his sudden death
were shrouded in gory mystery; And the mother
of the insanely jealous princess was a daughter of
Europe’s grand old debauchee, the King of the
Belgians, noted as the principal recipient of
Modern Babylon’s Maiden Tribute. All things
considered this recent work of matronly vengeance
is a_ Joke with a huge capital J. One
imagines the two aged grandfathers exchanging
notes of exclamation on the unreasonable vin-
dictiveness of their 20-year-old relative. Also one
supposes that pretty actresses will begin to be shy
of royal endearments, otherwise a number of
violent deaths in the theatrical profession are
certain to ensue. By murdering her husband’s
best girl with impunity Archduchess Elizabeth
has established a dangerous precedent, and the
next time a princess comes along to catch the
Guilty Pair she will not need to step across the
bleeding corpse of a flunkey. The faithful servant
will abandon sentry duty when he catches sight of
the boss’s lawful Liza.

A phase of the struggle for a crust ! A
couple of men drew mild attention in Melbourne
streets lately by meandering around bareheaded,
dressed in khaki suits. One was as bald as a
’Pootra’s egg ; the other was luxuriantly thatched.
Latter’s back bore an inscription stating he had
been using Slubb’s Hair Exciter or some such
nostrum; his mate notified the public that he was
going to use it. Victoria has so far kept clear
of that abomination, the London sandwich-man —
the image of God degraded to the uses of a blatant
advertisement—but it is getting very near it.
ON THE BLOCK.
RAT: “Spare’s a
copper to’rds a
bed, sir?”
SWRLL (fiercely): “Gerrout. Haven't any change.”
RAT (patronisingly): “Oh, I s’pose I could give
yer change fer a quid, ole chap.”
Cabled that some European miners in the
Transvaal have petitioned in favor of Chinese
labor. How the petition was faked is shown by a
letter in the Johannesburg Stab from Mr. H. S.
Raitt, member of the Transvaal Legislative
Council, in which he protests
against the cowardly methods of the pro-Chinese
party. They have enrolled the mine managers, arming
them with petition forms, which they are inducing, or
rather coercing, their workmen to sign in favor of Chinese
importation. Those who know the mines know what this
means. It is a question of sign or sack. The Chinese
importation proposition has been introduced as a care-
fully matured plan, not as a conclusion to which we are
driven when all else has failed, but as a fixed determina-
tion to be forced on the country, whether it wants it or
not, whether it needs it or not. It is a determined
effort to supplant the white race as a factor to be con-
sidered in the colony.
THE COMMISSION OF THE PEACE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Recently at Goulburn the Police Magistrate, Mr.
Stephen Murphy, fined a man £2O for betting. Shortly
after a number of persons were brought before the court
tor similar offences. Things looked promising for the
revenue, but this time many Justices of the Peace
attended. The Police Magistrate made some pleasant
references to Bench-packing. The Bench had, he said,
resolved to take a lenient view, and had decided that in
the present cases a fine of 40s. should be imposed, though
he was in favor of a higher penalty : ■
Of course it’s always possible for blunders to occur ;
The wisest and the best of men are liable to err,
And then we know that gentlemen who sign themselves
“J.P.”
Are always recommended for their strict integrity.
That noble institution, the Commission of the Peace,
Is honestly respected by the public and police.
There never was a gentleman appointed, we may state,
For lending his assistance to a Party Candidate 1
Upon my word
It's most absurd
The notion ought to cease
That honorary magistrates promiscuously increase.
You must possess ability,
Position and gentility,
Or you cannot be appointed as a Justice of the Peace !
And then to think that persons of position and renown,
In Bathurst or in Goulburn or in any other town,
Would dream of going on the Bench to lend a friend a
hand
Is something too preposterous for"me to understand !
If Mr. Stephen Murphy is an officer of zeal
It seems to me on second thoughts he really ought to feel
The deepest of regret for inadvisable remarks
On gentlemanly Justices at Goulburn or at Parkes,
Or here, or there,
Or anywhere,
Because it’s all the same ;
All Justices are gentlemen of high and honored name
Who fill the Bench with dignity,
Sans favor or malignity,
Regardless of the influence of flattery or blame 1
We know, at least we ought to know, that Ministers
select
Those gentlemen for Justices who’re worthy of respect.
Of course there have been rumors (spread by evil-
minded men)
Of Justices who hardly knew the way to hold a pen.
But these are idle rumors, silly slanders, nothing more,
And st iries which we all of us must certainly deplore ;
For facts that daily come to light continually increase
Our general respect for the Commission of the Peace !
I honor them
And Mr. M.
Will quite agree with me
That none but educated men are ever made J.P.
It’s certainly untenable
To think they are amenable
To influence ; for such a thing could never, never be 1

And kissed my hair,

Because —I loved.
Do I regret? Ah, no !

One of the most pathetic sights in Melb.
is the unfinished soldiers’ memorial on St.
Kilda-road, the erection of which was started
something like 18 months ago, and has
progressed only so far that the eye of
the passing citizen is offended by an
unshapely mass of stone with scaffold-
ing all round it. Nothing has been
done to the concern for many
months past, the men engaged on
the job having apparently forgotten,'
along with the public generally,
that Australia ever sent a horde of
its wildest youth to S’Africa on a
hazardous cattle-duffing expedition.
Melbourne, by the way, has more
incomplete public works and more
half-baked monuments in it than
any other Australian city. The
central railway station, which
doesn’t happen to be in Thomas
Bent’s electorate, stands just as
that statesmanlike market gardener
left it twelve months ago, most of
the old Flinders-street station
having been pulled down, and noth-
ing but an elaborate, unfinished
subway and some unpicturesque
excavations having been contri-
buted towards the new terminus.
The Public Library extensions
have also been held up indefinitely,
and everybody is puzzled to
know when the skeleton building
is to be proceeded with. The
Fever Hospital, which only needs
a few thousands for completion,
is still the haunt of the stray cat
and the casual tarantula. Like-
wise, the present Cabinet is such
an insanitary one that it sees no
urgent need for sewering the
public buildings, and is the only
offender in Melbourne in this
respect.

Evidence given in Scotland
in a recent adulteration case
elicited that “brandy is a liquor
imported from France, and is a
mixture of grape spirit and some
spirit unknown except to pro-
ducers. If the liquor looks, smells,
and tastes like brandy, that is
enough for retail purposes. Brandy
is brandy, whether it is made from
grapes, grain, rotten figs, potatoes, or
black ants. No one can buy real brandy at 89.

“ Adelaide ” : Accept an indignant protest
against the statement (8., 22/10/3) that “ the nude
lady out in the open air is always regarded with
a certain amount of gloom in Adelaide.” If it
refers to pictures, it is to some extent true ; but
in that case why the qualification “ out in the open
air ” ? As for the nude lady in the open, why, she
is probably more numerous in (i.e., about) Ade-
laide than in any other large city since Sparta
was in its prime ! Its adjacent seashore is one
long stretch of perfect sand, including six well-
populated places, but only two enclosed baths.
The S.A. summer makes two baths a day not
only a luxury but a necessity; cheap trains run
the six or eight miles from the city, and sharks
(though always spoken of with respect) have never
been known to harm anyone on this coast. So
for two hours every morning, and more than that
every evening, there may be seen some 14 miles
of undressed humanity, of which the handsomer
sex forms more than half. Not that it bathes
actually in the altogether; in the sheltering waves
a trifle of flannelette preserves the conventions.
But, once out again on the beach, even the most
modest woman has to dry herself.

Any youth under 16 years of age who
smokes in sight of a policeman in Maoriland after
Jan. 1 will be liable to a fine of .£lO. A well-
meaning lawyer named Field has for years been
toying with this Juvenile Smoking Suppression
Bill with very little hope of success, but it passed
at last by one vote, and Field awoke one morning
to find himself remarkable, if not famous.
A LOST FLAVOR.
VISITOR (Scene—Sydney Harbor): “The per-

SYDNEY CYNIC : “ You should have been here

Ihe Law in Victoria has discovered that
C i n< b o L ita lon £- st anding practices is quite illegal.
A P.M. was called to Ballarat Gaol to punish an
obstreperous confinee on remand, but declined,
saying that any charge laid against a nominally
tree man must be investigated in open court. As
the btate has been calling in J.’sP. in an off-hand
way to suppress unconvicted prisoners for many
years it is beginning to wonder what sort of a bill
for damages it may have to pay when the news
gets about.

“Periwinkle”: Daring the past week
have inquired a bit off the women around Grass-
fireville to learn how their votes might go at the
Federal scramble. Out of 22 skirties I yarned to
20 had votes and didn’t know it. The other two
had heard that they were expected to record their
votes by a chance remark made by their parson
(Methodist). Where and when they were to vote
they couldn’t tell, or who the candidates were—or
anything. They didn’t seem eager for informa-
tion, either. Most of them had, however, a
vague recollection that the local trooper had called
hurriedly one day, when the rain was falling, but
then he often calls about rabbits, grass-fires, ac-
counts not settled, and stray beasts reported
stolen —and Dad always attends to that! Strikes
me, most of the women look upon the Franchise
as another burden thrust upon their lean, bent
shoulders—at least,_ the sigh of relief the whole 22
women gave when informed that they needn’t put
on last season’s bonnet to go to the poll, unless
they cared to, led me to believe they were the
possessors of something they hadn’t asked for !
“ 0.C.C.” states a truth, which ought to
be true if it isn’t:
The G.O.C. is, as you know, an insufferable blusterer,
but the other day he was “ taken down.” Hutton had
been getting on to a prominent and ordinarily lady-like
officer. The imported General had often carbonadoed him
with great success, but this particular morning he had
missed his breakfast, or cut herself while shaving, or
something, and his temper had gone to little pieces. So,
when Hutton had dug the spurs of his eloquence deeply
into the flanks of the offence (whatever it was) that
gentle warrior stopped the stream of Huttonian exple-
tives by starting up suddenly and bringing his fist down
right on the G.O.D.’s—that is, G.O.C.’s—sacred blotting-
pad with a blow that nearly split the table and upset the
holy inkpots over the consecrated despatches. “By God,
sir!” said he, as Hutton blinked up foolishly—“by
God, sir ! There is a point beyond which even you shail
not go 1 There is a time when even discipline cannot
restrain 1 Row dare you talk to me like that? You know
you’ve no right to do it—and, by God, sir ! you shan’t l ”
Hutton, for once, hadn’t a word to say, but meekly
accepted the reproof, and even asked the officer for a
cigarette. He got it.
“ Polly,” from Hobait :
Received an insulting electioneering notice from Mr.
Post Ollice Fysh, in which he addressed me as “ an old
supporter” of his. Now, in the first place, it’s bad
enough to have had him taking all the test-paying public
billets—from State Premiership to Agent-Generalship,
and now a Federal Cabinet snap—without rubbing it in
on every possible occasion that he gets his support out
of the public’s pockets. As I take in washing, keep
boarders, and run the corner store, I manage to support
my husband and such of his male relatives as are out
of a job, which they mostly are. I can sincerely
sympathise with Mrs. Fysh, and if she were asking for my
vote, she should have it. As for Fillup’s insinuations that
I’ve been supporting him as well as my own husband they
might pass, but he calls me old. I’m old enough to be
his grand-daughter. He must be old enough to need a
caretaker, if he doesn’t know better than to try and
coax votes from the ladies by labelling them old and
printing it in bold, black letters in the most prominent
spot in his begging letter. Oh, I didn’t forget to vote.

“C.C.”: The latest scheme for raising a
drink. Yesterday a respectable-looking wreck
drifted against me on a pub. verandah and whis-
pered confidentially that he was one of the
notorious six hatters. “Gerrymandered by the
Deakin Government,” he breathed heavily in my
ear, and then he offered to give me the full
strength of the trouble if I would shout. When
informed that I had already met 35 of those six
hatters he bore away looking mad enough for the
whole consignment. If the calamitous six really
exist, George Reid missed a splendid opportunity
by not engaging them tor his electioneering tour.
Properly stage-managed, they would have drawn
crowded houses. Something in this style :
Cue: “ This traitorous Government that prates of
loyalty to the motherland, and then refuses a landing to
six of her noblest sons.”
Enter six hatters in glossy bell-toppers decorated with
a card bearing the legend—“ This style, 10s. 6d.” All
wave union jacks with one hand, and rattle their bell-
toppers on their foreheads with the other. Patriotic
song and the “Mad Hatters’ Fandango” as a finale.
But perhaps the hatters are too busy rehearsing
for the Xmas pantomimes.

Just when there has been a revival of the
liberty-of-the-subject cry in Tas., and when the
man who won’t join a union has been praised to
the. clouds, a row has arisen over the new Health
Officer of Hobart. The appointee belongs to the
Homoeopathic Union, and won’t join the Medical
Union ; and the members of the latter, who have
been yelling that it oughtn’t to matter a straw
whether a man is a unionist or not, are raising
Cain because this man is carrying out their own
alleged principles.

“ Burglar Bill ” : This weird expectancy
that Bulletin writers mention is very noticeable
in gaol. Every prisoner is ex-
pecting to be released on peti-
tion, and if called up before the
gaol governor regarding any
small matter, fully expects to
hear of his immediate dis-
charge. Knew one who never
undressed for years, afraid
that he might be sent for
at any time and acquainted
with his good fortune.
Then he started to talk
queerly; said he had
done 15 years when he
had just finished four;
would shriek out in the
middle of the night:
“ How long, O Lord !
how long ? ” and when
he got no answer would
wake the wing repeat-
ing the question. They
took him away some-
where at last when he
had become a hopeless
lunatic; the “expec-
tancy” had destroyed his
mental balance. After
an execution —the first
for years—the sweeper
put a clean towel and a
fresh piece of soap into
the condemned cell.
When I asked him why,
he said, “ Oh, there
might be another in at
any minute.” He had
the expectancy. All the
“ screws” are expecting
stripes or the sack; they
mostly get the sack.
The governor is expect-
ing a pension after herd-
ing convicts for 40years,
and the executioner is
expecting to hang some-
body.

Adelaide crematorium is now quite exten-
sively patronised by the medical profession, the
latest offering being elderly Dr. Wylde. -The
deceased was one of the promoters of the “ oven,”
and was determined no discredit should be cast
upon his hobby. His coffin was constructed of
the thinnest Californian pine, and was saturated
with spirits to help combustion. It and its con-
tents disappeared in ten minutes. Cremation, by
the way, should in time become a boon to those
individuals interested in ancestors. Some enter-
prising person will yet set up a high-class dust
shop where the ash of noble progenitors can be
bought in jars, and Ham fat, with his newly-
acquired fortune, can then set up as the heir of
a hundred burnt earls.
When are the Victorian central authorities
going to compel the Bumbles of the country
shire councils to keep the dairies and farm yards
clean? Director of Agriculture Wallace showed
the whole dirty business up the other day when
he published disgusting details from the reports
of the dairy inspectors. These reports set out
that cows were milked under the filthiest con-
ditions and that the milking utensils were en-
crusted with dirt and manure. Some of the shire
councils have tried to get back on Director
Wallace by passing resolutions condemning him.
Wallace, however, hits out vigorously and if one
were to wash the dirt off the farmers’ faces they
should be found to have black eyes. He publishes
figue3 showing that out of 120 municipalities in
which dairying is carried on to any extent, eight
only are carrying out the inspection of dairies in
a satisfactory manner, 26 are carrying out the
inspection indifferently, 38 in name only, and 48
are sitting down admiring the accumulation of
the filth, and are not causing any inspection to
be made whatever.
VENGEANCE IS A DISH
TO BE EATEN COLD.
MISSUS (who has had words with Sarah Carly
in the day, speaking loudly for the benefit of
visitors): “Have you cleaned the silver,
Sarah?”
SARAH (in a cold, distinct voice that can be heard
in the drawing room): “ Yes, mum. I've
done the knives an ’ the saucepan lid.”
Motor-’busses are starting in Melbourne,
and the horse may as well recognise that in the
end he is a lost animal. Besides casual machines
running to cricket-matches and the beach, regular
trips are now made out to Newmarket at 3d. a
head. All along the wide, empty sweep of
Flemington-road they do al2 mile gait. Private
motors become increasingly frequent, and even
the trams and the railways may find the new
arrival a thing to be reckoned with very
seriously.

Dainty sweet she looked in white —
Bright the sky.
Soft the glorious moonlight beamed,
As we sat, and gazed, and dreamed,
Kissing infra dig. we deemed —

Evening next the heavens shone
Like a lamp,
Though the maiden whispered “John,

In surprise I simply stared
“ Tumbled 1” and her view I shared.

A WOMAN'S LETTER.
Sydney, December 15, 1903.
Mr Dear Arini,—
I put in an hour at the opening day of the test
match on Friday, and came away feeling that
my status had sunk to that of a lost soul.
There were 17,000 (official figures) other lost
souls there. The majority of them sat with
eyes olosed slitwise, and downward - curved
mouths, staring out toward the circle of green
earth where some:mighty atoms fooled with a bat
and a ball. I’ve always wondered what was the
only unforgivable sin, mentioned with vague
awesomeness, but hot defined, in the New Testa-
ment. Shouldn’t be surprised if it turned out to
be cricket.
Got a look at the two grandstands from
an opposite coign. The flowered, ribboned,
feathered hats of the lost souls massed into
chromatic points gave the impression of tier upon
tier of those tiny, many-oolored sweets with
which certain sticky buns are smothered, and
which are known as “hundreds and thousands.”
Didn’t know till I got a closer and back view of
the seated thousands on the grand-stands—mostly
women—what a number of grasshopper backs we
have amongst us, and the prevailing tone of string
color in the blousing of these backs does not make
for freshness. Their Rawson Ex’s and daughter
were present, with Private Sec. Share, who
looked like the Rajah of Bhong without the
latter’s bay window. Some day cricket will be a
medium for advertising—and a bowler will hurl
a ball labelled, “Drink Somebody’s Bella Donna
Cocktails,” and the bat that stops it will carry
advice about a certain liver pill.
When Miss Ada Crossley made her re-appear-
ance at Sydney Town Hall on Saturday night the
sea of faces within her ken seemed to turn to real
climbing green seas, whilst the walls of the hall
dipped and rose and shuddered, after the manner
of a buffeted vessel. The contralto, who is visibly
thinner, had had a rough, seasick passage from
Auckland, and reached Sydney only in time to
dress for the concert. At 7.15 the Sonoma had
not quite tethered itself at the Quay. For all
that, the singer was in fine voice. All through
Maoriland she got triumphal receptions and
had some local-color experiences. At Masterton
(near Wellington) she received some Maoris of
note, who taught her one verse of. “ Home, Sweet
Home ” in their language, and she sang it that
night at her concert. After the item, Mrs. Te
Taw, the chief’s wife, threw a splendid kiwi bag
on the platform. At Palmerston, a crowd of per-
sons who could not get into the hall to hear her,
built up a very temporary scaffolding beneath
a row of windows that ran on one side of the
hall, and so a few persons at a time could see as
well as hear. When the people on the roost had
had what the crowd below considered their fair
share they were promptly hauled down. In the
middle of one of Miss Crossley’s numbers there
was a crash, and a row of heads and hands disap-
peared amid shrieks and groans from the fallen
and fallen upon. Miss C. stopped, and Herr
Scherek hurried from the piano to learn the
number of killed and wounded. There were none,
and the concert proceeded.
Some of the press notices of this concert were
sparklets. Local paper spoke of the items given
by the rest of the co. as mere “stepping stones”
to those of the principal performer, but a Mas-
terton paper damned Peterkin as “ the weak spot
on the programme.” Jacobs raged: “III! with
a European reputation, to be called a stepping-
stone ”; but Peterkin was greatly tickled.
A resident assured him that M.L. was very fas-
tidious. After Santley sang in Napier a local
paper declared, “We much prefer Mr. Jobson (a
Napierite), and he can sing much louder too.”
Also in weightier matters than music M.L.
citizens assert themselves. Some years ago,
during an English political crisis, an Invercargill
resident cabled to Lord Salisbury, “Fight or
resign.”
Whilst in Wellington Miss Crossley dropped on
some pretty songs, the compositions of a local man
—George Kennedy. One is a lullaby, which she
will sing before her present tour ends.
A woman and her vote—and sectarianism. A
man was showing her how she should treat the
ballot paper. “You put a cross opposite the
name of your candidate, and ” “Across/”
interrupted the lady, “a cross indeed ! That’s
some more of Cardinal Moran’s dirty work. I
won’t make a cross—l’ll make just a plain mark.”
New Lord Mayor Lees has been Mayor of
Sydney previously. He is a printer, has two
married and some unmarried daughters, who are
very good on the banjo.
Longstaff’s portrait of the King has been highly
co nmended by Edward VII., who recognised
himself at once. Edward, who is a master of
t ivialities, had some slight alterations made,
while he waited, in the location of the orders on
the portrait’s breast. One was a mustard seed’s
length too high, another was a sixteenth of an
inch too close to the second button of the waist-
coast. Queen Alex’s portrait will be Longstaff’s
next royal work. Her Majesty has had a narrow
escape from being a burnt offering through badly
installed electric wires—same thing that caused
s °me disastrous Sydney fires. King Edward
wasn’t at Sandringham for the fire. He generally
wasn’t and isn’t.
That poster of Blamire Young’s advertising the
new monthly, His Excellency, is the best thing
of its kind ever seen on our hoardings. Faces you
a Spanish Excellency of the old, proud, knightly,
drinking, duelling days. He rests his right,
gloved hand upon his sword, with his left hand
he has just swung off his wide-plumed hat low as
his knee. From out his love locks frowns the stern,
haughty face of a man past his prime—one who
has lived every day of his life and accepted
or wrested all that life and love and war
could offer. And now—the lion eats mice in his
old age. The memory of it all is so strong within
him, that it exudes, and you know a hush falls
upon the salons full of pretty women and young
swashbucklers whenever he is announced. You
know he pauses a moment in conscious dignity
before he carries his portly figure and armorially*
embroidered suit into the courtesying group.
To live up to that poster a paper would have to
be something very good, indeed. As it is, His
Excellency, “a paper for society,” was born
with the death-damp on its brow. And are those
portraits really representative of Sydney society ?
We own more practical, if less picturesque,
Excellencies for this workaday period. A week
or so ago our Rawson Excellency and Lady went
to _ Manly to open a charitable fete, and whilst
doing the side-shows, got on the merry-go-round
and had a whirly ride. The Empire ought to be
safe for another hundred years at least. By the
way, the owner of that merry-go-round is Gypsy
Smith, one of the specialities of Manly. He
wears gold earrings, and a seal-skin coat with
actual sovereigns for buttons down the front.
Amy Castles will appear, her teacher Bouhy
told a returned Sydneysider, in grand opera in
Paris within a twelvemonth. Her voice, accord-
ing to said ’sider, is more beautiful than ever.
Saw Carrie Moore’s two sisters in short pink
frocks in the chorus of the “Fortune-Teller,” at
the Royal, last week. Nice, bright-looking girls,
miniature editions of Carrie herself. Dorothy Vane
Menzies will come through Sydney presently en
route for her pleasure-trip to the land of the
slant-eyed peoples who cultivate chrysanthemums
and misunderstandings with Russia. Buxom
Blanche Wallace is announcing her engagement
to a Westralian rich man. The Countess of
Darnley is in Sydney for the cricket. Also Mr.
Davies, of Davies and Fehon, has secured a
divorce from his wife. He has a beautiful home
at Point Piper. The foregoing may be
classed as fashionable intelligence because of its
mention of stage people, and a countess and a
divorce.
Our friend Arthur Adams, the Maorilander, has
a short story in Nov. number of Cosmopolitan, all
about a variety-show girl, and the yellow flame-
like kowhai blossoms, and a boundary-rider with
the familiar name of Jim. It gives Arthur a
chance to describe triple-peaked Ruapehu very
prettily.
You may remember the Mackenzie Fairfaxes
who stopped awhile at the Australia Hotel, in
Sydney, a year or so ago. They stirred the society
waters by a ripple or two ; and she gave a concert
and some smart at-homes. He is a son of Mr.
Ross Fairfax. She, a pretty little body, was a
concert singer when her gentlemanly-looking,
silly-faced John wooed and won her. Well, Mrs.
M.F. has secured a judicial separation from her
husband with the custody of the child and extensive
alimony. She declined to go for a divorce although,
to quote London D. Telegraph, “he offered to
allow her £B5O if she would leave her flat in
Ashley Gardens so that he might bring another
lady to live with him there.” The arcticness of
the proposal! The discordant third who destroyed
the matrimonial duet is alluded to in the pub-
lished reports of the suit as Vera Eyton, an
actress.
The English cricket team is putting up at a
leading Sydney hotel, and has provided, or has
been provided, with a fearsome sort of flag, a
combination of the team’s own colors and of the
Berritish Union Jack. When the team is at the
hotel the flag proudly floats over the city ; when
it is away, the flag comes down. This is the story
that was told to me, but it doesn’t look quite con-
vincing. What happens to the flag when half of
the players are at home and half are out ?
Manly water chute is being opened just as The
Bulletin rushes into print. No official word was
received in this office that the Governor would
shoot the chute, or ride the camel-backed tobog-
gan, or waltz round on the fiery serpent, but in
all probability his coat-tails were seen streaming
like a pennant over the first boat-load that flew
down to the duck-pond a hundred or so feet
below. His Ex. could get more thrills out of it
than he did out of the Gypsy’s merry-go-round.
My Hobart correspondent writes:
“Ada Crossley, at Hobart, got a reception bigger
and more enthusiastic than that of any Governor
that ever went to rule the Speck Island. The
last big crowd that assembled at the railway
station was when the Cameron came from
S’Africa, but Crossley’s event might have been
the reception of Boadicea by her people after she
struck Rome in the eye. It was queenly. Mrs.
Premier Propsting . and Secretary-to-Premier
Addison met, at Bridgewater, the train that
brought Ada in the Ministerial carriage from
Launceston, and bore her in triumph to
Hobart. Then Premier Propsting, Minister
for Lands Lyne (brother of Sweet William)
and Mayor Bennison, hats in hand, went into
the carriage and did homage to Ada, and
when the voice-queen appeared on the platform
a mighty cheer rent the air. Mrs. Bennison gave
her a bouquet, and Tim Hayward, the city
organist, gave her a big basket of strawberries,
absolutely the first of the season given or sold to
anybody. Timotheus had had them specially
forced in a hothouse for Ada. Then the empresa-
oontralto was conducted to what was said to be an
open carriage, but nothing was visible but rose 3
and two horses. Five thousand people cheered
and flew handkerchiefs as Ada nestled in her bed
of roses, and drove round town to Heathorn’s
hotel, with two troopers in attendance. The two
concerts at the Royal (dress-circle and stalls 10s.)
were attended by every Hobart man and woman
who had anything to pawn for half-a-sovereign
and when the second concert was over the men
rose up in their manhood and cheered and shouted
for Ada till Frahm, the scene-painter, wept and
made a scene, and Benno Scherek tore his beauti-
ful hair with joy.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent
“The going of Governors from this square and
straight city of ours has dwindled down to the
interest of a minor show. Chinny Clarke came in
for the full flood of farewells, so that Gov.-Gen.
Tennyson, setting off with his kit and clan a
week or two later, merely got a backwash.
Besides, there was the wind-up of the Slap.-
Musgrove extravaganza as a counter attraction.
“The Mayoral holocaust to the departing
Tennysons, the other Saturday, was on the same
dizzy scale as that sent up to the minor vice-regals
of the previous fortnight. It couldn’t very well
be dizzier, seeing that the Town Hall is not built
on the extension system, and when a hall already
holds all the Dazzle that can possibly be put into
it, the impossibility of inserting any more Dazzle
is too obvious to require any further explanation.
“Quakerish grey broke out virulently at that
M'Eacbarn show. The Mayoress led off with the
demure hue, but added to it the pink roses of hope
and promise. An entire grey is as depressing as a
whitewashed circus jester. Mrs. Waxcellency
Madden was another prominent grey garber, but
her brightening process consisted of a shower of
silver sequins and a goodly outlay of jewels. In
the gem department she had them all on. Coun-
tess Darnley’s gold-brown head, with its weird
half-hoop of diamonds, had an inch or two of
advantage over most others. Her niece, Miss
Daniels, was about the daintiest little flutterer in
the throng. Her wealth of deep red hair was
massed into a lovely crown pile, leaving the brow
bare. Like most of the red-haired, Miss Daniels
has a pure cream skin. Also she had a lilac frock.
“How vastly different the strained, uncomfort-
able leave-taking of Countess Hopetoun to that
of chirpy and homely Lady Tennyson ! The
Excellency of Chill had only a sparse number of
the Chosen around her on deck, and these stood
far-off, out of sympathy, beyond the understand-
ing of that tall, shy woman with the cold lips and
the wistful eyes. Her loneliness was apparent,
but the Elect did not know how to act. So a
heavy silence hung about the scene. Suppressed
emotion was not the sign of the Tennyson send-
off. Her amiable Ex. hurriedly shook hands all
round, laughed and made her regrets in turn, and
finally hung out of the car window fluttering her
bit of cambric in a last ta-ta.
“Lady Tennyson impressed, over and over
again, upon an interviewer that she really and
truly was sorry to give up Australian life. This'
protestation seems to throw doubts upon the fare-
well expressions of the preceding Excellencies.
The next departing Vice-regentess will have to
go before magistrate Panton and swear to her
regrets.
“ May Beatty, the star-performer of the Slap.-
Musgrove court show, threw a touch of nature or
else a bit of clever acting into her rble of witness.
She declared that she loved the part of Pom-Pom,
and counsel Duffy remarked, ‘ And we all loved
it, too.’ The charmer leaned forward excitedly
saying, ‘Did you?’ For a minute she forgot—
or seemed to forget—the whole court business in
the sudden access of her young enthusiasm.
Again, ‘You are the lady,’ twitted counsel, ‘ who
charmed us with “ How I Love Society”’—to
which May, under drooping eyelids, answered
softly and with a blush, ‘I did not know I
charmed you.’
“Madame ‘Slap’ laid herself out to fetch the
jury in a chic blue-and-white scrolled costume
with white collar and cuffs, and balloon sleeves,
white gloves, narrow green belt, grey feather boa,
and sweeping black hat with black ostrich feathers.
Apparently, too, she did fetch it. She fenced
brilliantly with Isaacs, but though that eminent
counsel had no grey feather boa to impress the
public, he more than once out-manneuvred her.
Madame evidently has a temper of her own, but
she kept it well, biting her lips over unruly re-
plies that were just on the verge of escaping her, and
tapping a shapely foot. Husband * Slap ’ grinned
hugely. Much merriment was occasioned by the
recounting of the latter’s persistent endeavors to
get his better half into harness. Whenever
Musgrove was stuck for someone to take a part or
to double two, ‘Slap’ would chip in, ‘Well,
there’s the missus.’ And the ‘missus’ took her
part well, all along the line.
“Judging by their scarcity on the so-called
‘ second day ’ of the Austral meeting, the Smartest
see few points of attraction in scantilv-clad Aus-
tralian wheelers (with a few Yanks thrown in)
as compared with bronzed Britishers in well-cut
cricket flannels. The bike hero has his feminine
following. The members’ enclosure was full of
her, the other day, but she’s not the cousin, the
sister, or the aunt of the ‘ First-born of Egypt,’
as Shakspeare called the Naicest of his time.
Nevertheless, the ‘ bicycle girl ’ is young and
pretty and dressy. Her shoes are small, as a rule,
and her hat large. At the Austral meeting, the
women’s millinery crowded the men out. In the
marquees there were rows and rows of Jills with
never a Jack amongst them. Mere man was off
on his own, watching the sports unshadowed by
his best girl’s hat-brim. This year of defensive
broad-brims will be, methinks, as unfruitful of
engagements as ’93, with its financial disasters.
The man of to-day can’t get near enough to his
girl to propose, all by reason of her hat.
“Among the riders, the snappiest items were the
stalwart Yank visitors, striding about when off
the saddle in ankle-deep dressing-gowns of fawn,
beflowered with brown. Mayor M Eaeharn, his
features glued into their usual smile of would-be
bonhomie and man-of-the-wor dishness, strutted
on to the oval, in company with his slip oi a son,
all frock-coat, top-hat, and juvenile attempts at
West-End swagger.
“The son and heir of Mayor M‘Eacbarn was
packed off ’Ome the other day for mental repairs
and improvements at Oxford. His mother travels
as far as Albany. There is some likeness between
the sleek, dark sons of Malcolm and loby .bar-
ton’s. They are close chums as well.
“Miss Vida Goldstein advertised some rigid
facts about her beliefs and her opinions on
Saturday, because of the lying rumors in
circulation. Two statements stood out. Her
views on marriage are quite normal, and she was
brought up and is a Protestant, and a regular
church attendant. ;
“ Just as the social barometer was running down
to depression point, Mrs. Claude Macdonald hove
in sight and gave a new interest to the frill con-
test. There’s no frocker this side quite as daring
or attractive in her clothes art as this member of
the squattocracy. v
“It seems that Surgeon Fitzgerald, of Mel-
bourne, commanded J. C. Williamson to trip to
Europe for the sake of his overwrought nerves.
Although careful of his health in some respects,
as his well-preserved appearance shows, James
Cassius W. overworks himself, and is now under
the strictest medical orders to go slow.
“ The throng took up every inch of Town Hall
space not actually required by the youthful
performers at Mrs. W. Green’s fancy ball the
other Monday night. It would seem that the
dancing craze increases, and that young Aus-
tralia’s toe becomes daily more fantastic. Irene
Dillon, the best-known young tripper of the
amateur stage, was weird, dazzling, seductive in
a Sirenesque measure called ‘La Caprice En-
chanteur,’ and the fantastic whirlings, the flash
and brilliancy of Mrs. Green’s sylph-like daughter
brought down the packed hall in her cascade pas
seul. Toodles and Babs take very joyously to the
dancing business, and school teachers complain that
it becomes as a consequence more and more diffi-
cult to drive them in the weary ways of the multi-
plication table and the steep paths of geography.
“ Apart from the very emphatic desirability of
Miss Una Bourne being despatched to the
European masters, that she may add a final touch
of inspiration to her piano play, her worn and
pallid look makes its own tender appeal for a rest,
a voyage, and a general loaf. The more her
talent grows, the more fleshless is her face, the
more luminous —in a spiritual way—her eye. All
the bodily strength of the clever pianiste seems to
be concentrated in her fingers. When she is
playing most brilliantly the pallor of the face is
alarming, and the body, if allowed to relax, might
snap. So Una needs her holiday, and, as she is
certainly Melbourne’s'most applauded and capable
strummer, the city should lose no time in pushing
her off.
“A much-talked-of item at the District Nursing
Bazaar was a doll’s trousseau (worth £6O), ex-
hibited by a fashionable drapery firm, which had
made it to the order of a little Tasmanian girl.
The lilliput outfit was a copy of a well-to-do flesh-
and-blood bride’s plenishing. The gowns had silk
linings, there were hats to suit all occasions,
festive or informal. Gloves, shoes, fans for
evening or day use respectively were on hand,
also coffee-coats, dressing-jackets, and ‘ twelve
each ’ of underwear items. Pity to see morbid
extravagance beginning in our hitherto compara-
tively healthy-minded Commonwealth ! We may
end by thinkingnoshameinlavishingsmallfortunes
on dogs’ dinner-parties and cats’ christenings, after
the manner of the degenerates of London and New
York. Don’t believe £6O, spent on a wooden-
headed toy, gives Dolly’s owner anything like
good value in pleasure. Now, if the investment
had been on behalf of a real, live baby ! Scribe
knows a 10-year-old lass, at present, who can’t sleep
o’ nights for joy and excitement, just because the
postman’s wife has had twins. Postman confessed,
when he handed in the letters, that ‘the missus had
provided skimpy enough for one, let alone two!’
Ten-year old’s mother is letting her daughter deal
with all the gaily-colored things in the little
strangers’ wardrobes —the Turkey-red, the pink
flannel, and the blue bootees—hence the kid’s
delight.
“The news from the other side is that Miss
Lucy Shuter, the olive-skinned Toorak belle, a
daughter of magistrate Shuter, is to marry
Mr. William Mortimer, a wealthy Lancashire
bachelor.
“The latent ‘Melbourne Musical'Magazine,’
published by Allan and Co., includes the song
that Ada Crossley warbles so beautifully, *Oh !
that We Two were Maying.’ There are twelve
other songs in the book —a carefully mixed lot of
ballads, comic choruses, and otherwise—but the
popular Crossley item is the most pressing induce-
ment to pay a mere shilling for the lot. By the
way, the sentiments of ‘Oh ! That We Two’ are
very conflicting. In the first verse the singer
wants to be picking flowers ; in the next she would
prefer to be seated on the grass ; her third desire
is to be lying buried beside the other person.
Yours affectionately,
AKRNEHI.

„ Iw „ in . t 14 » sayi Miss Florrie Smith, of Harrow Road, Auburn, Sydney, “ when I started to slip into bad health.
I was just » , f vvith a splitting headache. My sides ached until I could hardly stand. I was sore and

PERSONAL ITEMS.
J. H. Abbott, of Vic. House of 48 Rich
Landlords, is probably the oldest newspaper pro-
prietor in Australia. He owned the Diggers’
Advocate (Bendigo) 50 years ago.
John Darling, father of S.A. Opposition
leader, says he used to drive a cart selling water
to Adelaide residents before there were any
Government waterworks in-South Australia.
Deakin spoke one night at Glen Innes ;
G. H. Reid the next. Local paper announced
its verdict—“Deakin was as much above Reid
as Heaven is above earth. ’ It was after that
Reid declared himself tiring of politics.
“ B.” : Digby Berry and Dill Macky are
said to be descendants of two of Oliver Cromwell’s
daughters. Hence their continuous desire to hew
Agag in pieces before the Lord. But Agag, as
usual, objects to be hewn, and makes a dust.
Speaker Lee Steere’s death in Westralia
robs the big wool and station firm of Dalgety of
its third head within a few weeks. First, there
was John Lackey, long N.S.W. chairman of the
co.; them W. Kilgour, manager in Sydney ; now
the Westralian chairman.
A Prime Minister and a Parliamentary
party swept into a certain railway refreshment
room and ate. The manager was
a stranger, who knew much
about catering and little of
politics, but he knew that the
lion of the show was named
Barton, and heard some of
the more eminent of the
menagerie caff him
“Toby.” Presently the
lion said: “Send the
hill in to me. ’ Then
the man who knew
nothing of politics
addressed an artis-
tically got-up ac-
count to “Mr.
Toby Rarton,
M.P.” In due
course a depart-
mental re mon-
strance was sent,
which remon-
strance the astoun-
ded caterer didn’t
at all understand.
One day he saw the
Great Man in the
street, and button-
holed liim : “ Is not
your name Toby
Barton?” (replea-
ded. “Of course
it is, and don’t
you forget it,”
replied the
genial one. But,
all the same,
when the de-
partment paid
the hill it made
the caterer
apologise for
putting “Toby”
on the account,
and, consider-
ing that Barton
said he was
Toby, that food
man was more
bewildered than
ever.
A German
military critic
has reverted to
the old ques-
tion of the Brit-
ish fiasco at Co-
leuso, holding that
General B ull e r’s
plan of attack was
preposterously foolish. Poor old Buffer 1 He
had seemed a fairly capable man, as British
generals go, until he grew bulky in luxurious
idleness and became a champagner rather than a
campaigner. Lord Roberts’s condemnation of
Buffer was doubtless strengthened by the chief’s
teetotal principles.
An old German couple of South Australia,
Mr. and Mrs. Gerlaeh, the other day finished
their 65th year of married life. Emperor Biff,
prompted by the local consul, sent them out a
silver medal.
Profit Dowie’s wife and son travel Aus
traliawards with a lady secretary and an undesir-
able immigrant in the shape of a negro butler.
The profitess has a dressing-maid, but she isn’t
coming all the way.
Mr. J. A. Hill, a pioneer of South Aus-
tralia, has dropped into a baronetcy. Mr. Hill
was one of the little hand of ad venturers who landed
in S. A. in 1836 from the ship Africaine. He lives
now at Laura, S.A.
Many persons were under the impression
thatF. A. Wright, M.L.A. (of Wright, Heaton
and Co.), died poor. His will for probate pur-
poses has been proved at <£39,463, all of which
passes to his widow and children.
Clement Sabine, who died rather suddenly
in Adelaide, the other day, was the secretary of
the Northern Territory Co. when it was formed
in 1864. It finished a short career Hve years later.
Sabine was one of the promoters and one time a
director of the Glenelg railway.
Herbert Nicholls, the athletic Tasmanian
Attorney-General, and the most pronounced and
resolute democrat in the Propsting Government,
has not been in his place in Parliament these last
few days. He has the mumps, which is an un-
usual complaint for an Attorney-General.
Professor Henderson, of Adelaide Uni-
versity (S. A.), who is engaged in writing an official
biography of Hori Grey, is taking a trip to Cape-
town to examine in the museum there papers pre-
sented by the great pro-consul, and dig up lost
and forgotten information about his career.
“Lenore ” (Perth, W.A.) :
Re your par. (5/11/’O3) stating S.A. Judge Bundey was
the only Australian attaining to mayoralty before mount-
ing the woolsack. Both Stone and Parker, the former
C.J. and the latter first puisne, presided over Perth’s
municipal parliament. Parker filled the robes durirg
George and May’s visit to Horsetralia.
“ Elector ” : I can’t think of George Reid
and his pranks without remembering Josh Billings
apt piece of advice —“ Thare iz grate risk in play-
ing the monkey. It is possible for the. monkey to
be a very philosophikal cuss, but 2-thirds ov the
world will keep both eyes on the monkey all the
time, and lose sight of the philosophy.” And
George forgets that the most popular clown, after
all, is—“the dummy.”
“Steele Rudd ” has lost his job as Queens-
land Under-Sheriff. The retrenched humorist
threatens to publish a Steele Rudd’s Journal,
also to contest the next Camboova election against
Tire Macintosh now in possession. “Steele
Rudd ” hails from Cambooya, and if popularity
counts he should oust the Scotchman who goes
ploughing in kilts.
Judge Boucaut, who stepped from the
Premiership of S.A. to the Supreme Court Bench
in 1878, is in indifferent health, and it is probah'e
that Ire will retire on a pension in a few uronths.
He is*72 years old, while Bundey is only 65. Ex-
Senator John Downer is likely to succeed Boucaut,
if Gordon’s successor as Attorney-General does
not jump his claim.
Professor M’Callum, of Sydney Univer-
sity, in allowing himself to be elected to the
committee of the Preferential Trade League, nee
Imperial Trade League, pokes his nose farther
into contentious politics than did the Professor of
English History when he elucidated aspects of the
Boer war, and was threatened by intolerant
jingoes with loss of office.
A. H. Barlow, Government representative
in the Q. Legislative Council, was the lad in the
Bank of Australasia, Sydney, who, just 50 years
ago, had the job of packing up the books, station-
ery and clock required for the opening of the first
branch in Queensland —the Moreton Bay branch,
it was called. The clock is still at work in the
Ipswich office, but the pens, it is believed, are
worn out.
THE BLESSINGS OF PURE AIR.
SMITHSON: “I see [?]oor old Jugson, the fresh air
crank, has gone off. What did he die of ?”
BOBSON : “ Oh, he cut his throat with a razor
for ventilation.”
John Russell, recently deceased at Tra-
ralgon, Gippsland, aged 75, was one of the first
two white men to ascend Mount Baw-Bfl-W, his com-
panion being the late Ferdinand Von Alueller.
He was also the discover of the Russell s Cteek
diggings in the same locality.
The death is announced, in Scotland, of
T. L. Learmonth. aged 84. He became a squatter
at Buninyong (Vic.) in ’37, with his late brother,
and afterwards explored the country from Mount
Macedon to the Beckwith Ranges. For a time
he sat in the old Leg. Council.
Bigjohn Forrest has been telling his old
friends at Fremantle that “his pilgrimage is
nearly at an end,” and that he will probably
return soon to live among them. Forrest
has looked all his life more like a big, indignant
invader than a pilgrim, and this kind of mild,
resigned pathos is unusual in his case.
Appointment of J. H. Gordon to the
South Australian Bench closes what is probably a
record for any place possessing three judges.
There had been no change for just on 20 years .
Thus more than half of the present Bar never
knew any judges but the Way-Boucaut-Bundey
combination which has just been-broken.
Motions at the election of Sydney’s Gaud
Mayor for 1904: “That Alderman Ralston be
elected.” Alderman Ralston voted for that.
“ That Alderman Harris be elected. ” Alderman
Harris voted for that. “ That Alderman Mullins
be elected.” Alderman Mullins voted for that
Finally, “ That Alderman Lees be elected.' And
Alderman Lees voted for that.
Some rich people have been dying of late.
The will of Mrs. Jessie Blackmore Campbell,
widow of an M-L.C. and squatter, of Nowra
(N.S.W.), was proved recently at £129,166 ; and
that of, Robert Landale, squatter, of Deniliquin
(N.S.W.), has been proved at £78,476 Victorian
estate. In New South Wales he held nearly
30,000 acres, at a mere nominal rent.
When Governor Loch first arrived in Mel-
bourne, he knew so little of the duties of his
position that he thought he was expected to take
charge of a department. Immediately after
being sworn in he said to Premier Service— 1
am now ready to take over the defences. lhe
old wine-and-spirit merchant broke the news
softly to Loch that he was only an ornament.
Through Charles Harper’s succession to
the Westralian Speakership, vacant through
James Lee Steere’s death, the office goes, for the
first time, outside the Leake family. Hie original
Luke Leake was the State’s first Speaker; he
dated from the time when its only Parliament was
partly Crown-appointed and partly elected.
When he died his son-in-law, Lee Steere, suc-
ceeded.
The combining of two official positions in
the one person sometimes leads to peculiar re-
sults. Up North there is a certain Trustee in
Insolvency who is also a Curator in Insanity. On
one occasion the Trustee in Insolvency wrote a
long letter to the Curator in Insanity re a certain
estate. The Curator replied—also at length. A
spirited correspondence ensued, the Curator in
Insanity finally emerging victorious. When a
country’s insanity is triumphant over its Insol-
vency the outlook is, indeed, a gloomy one.
Old Queenslander Augustus Gregory, who
has been beknighted in his advanced age on the
ground that he did some exploring a long while
ago began that business in Westralia the year
before Big John Forrest was born. He taught
himself most of the surveying he knows, and did
the first of it with a compass of his own manu-
facture. He claims that he and his two brothers,
on their maiden expedition (in 1846), discovered
' the first coal found in the State —this was at the
Irwin River—and also located lead deposits on
the Murchison. The lead mines in that district
were subsequently worked for years, the stuff being
taken to Europe as ballast in wool ships ; but the
industry has been dead for a long while it hardly
pays anywhere now to work lead ore that doesn’t
also carry silver.
Sydney City Coroner Woore, who has just
retired on pension, was a bit of a martinet when
police magistrate at Wollongong (N.S.W.). The
sergeant of police offended his magisterial dignity
once by being seated in court. Mr. Woore
insisted on his standing ; and, with a prospect of
committal for contempt to his own lockup, the
sergeant stood. But he immediately placed him-
self in communication with Inspector-General
Fosbery, who told him that lie could remain
seated except when examining witnesses or
addressing the court. Next sitting day the ser-
geant was again peremptorily ordered to his feet,
and respectfully stated that he would see the
court boiled first, or something to that effect.
Then he handed up his documentary evidence,
and after that the heavens fell.
The Victorian “Reform” Parliament
probably averages greater riches than any other
sir.ee the time of the paper millionaires at the
middle of the Boom. Knight Gillott is reckoned
the top-notcher with something over half a
million, made as lawyer and hotel landlord. The
unpretentious Morrissey comes next with a for-
tune made out of pig-dealing (Morrissey bought
late Johnny Wallace’s big Quat Quatta estate, the
other day, for £82,000, apd a couple of years ago
purchased another N.S.W. property for nearly
half that amount). “ Pursey ’ Chirnside probably
comes next, and close up are Mackinnon (lawyer,
squatter, but democrat), new “Reform ’’member
Fairbairn, Labor member Wilkins (who can buy
and sell the rest of his party), Mines Minister
Cameron, “Charley” Forrest, grazier J. Cameron,
Shiels. Levien, and “ Reformers ” Swinburne and
McCutcheon.
Z ELMAN, SENTOB, of Melbourne Block.
Writes “ G.C.” :
Architectural Mavor CorVie keeps Brisbane society from
becoming a Golgotha of dry bones and melancholy. He
entertains class and no class or Prime Minister
—to his utmost on the munificence of his official allow-
ance of £5OO per annum. Governor ’Erbert Chermside
tvpifies the splendor and mystic awe of British isolation,
plus red tape, official etiquette, and military haw-haw.
Three at-homes and a ball to the Elect in Government
House garden are faintly remembered during the past IS
months, with a dinner thrown in on the birthday of
Edward VII. On agricultural matters and the breeding
of horses Gov. ’Erbert is a giant of theory and practical
ignorance. Farmers blush at their incompetence as
Ohermside urges them to plant the turnip-tree early,
and explains how the hen’s infant should not he weaned
too young.
Another of “Spring’s” Parliamentary
pictures:
N.S.W. Lands Minister Crick once described himself as
the “ stormy petrel ”of N.S.W. politics. To-day he
might be described as the stormy cockatoo of the poli-
tical aviary. His presence generally means wild wing-
flapping and strong language, which shocks the gentle
Sleath and other prudish legislative canaries. Crick’s
piloting of the Lands Bill was a cinematograph of atti-
tudes, wild and strange. In the early stages of the Bill
his earnestness was amazing. One night I saw a careless
figure huddled up on the Ministerial chair with legs
entwined, backbone protruding, shoulders high over the
short neck, head lowered, and the mind thoroughly
concentrated on a difficult amendment. The change
from the Crick of the street and of the lounge was a joy.
Admirers hailed it as the birth of a new Crick who had
dropped his past brilliant uselessness. As the Bdl
progressed and the Melbourne Cup drew near the
Minister lost all his dash. The last days of the Bill
found him restless and seemingly unconcerned. A
Council amendment brought on what the dailies
called a “crisis.” Crick, drowsy and hoarse,
looked as if he’d been round town all the night
before, backing horses. Although he considered the Bill
a child of his own brain, the members generally held it
as much theirs as his. Consequently, the House cor-
rected and spanked its own kid with true parental vigor.
The spanking took so long that Crick crawled off the
chair and was soon curled up on the bench dreaming that
Ossian was winning the Cup by a street. He thought he
heard the scream of the bookies, and opened one eye to
see Willis from the Banvon shouting out an electioneering
speech. He listened a minute to the clear, sincere,
manly, ringing remarks of Willis, then slammed his hot
head down again with a hang. James Ashton, staid,
deliberate, and with his pants turned up out of the wet,
made some remarks which soothed the Minister to further
sleep. When hq finished,, Gormly caught the Speaker’s-
eye and clung there for about fifteen minutes. Gorinlx’s
voice is guaranteed to destroy anyone’s slumber. The
tortured Minister groaned, sweated, wriggled, muttered,
and finally flopped over to the table and squeezed his
throbbing head between his hands. The third pict.i re
is that of Crick averting the “crisis.” Having
wearily commanded Waddell and other unimportant
supporters to go home to bed, he mooched in and then-
out again to get a lemon for his throat, leaving John
Kidd in charge. The “Domino King” allowed the
division to be taken after a strong anti-Upper House
speech by Ferguson. Being defeated by two, Crick
telephoned for the sleeping supporters, and, to save
time, moved that the Chairman leave the chair. The
“crisis” stirred Crick up. Like a bear in danger,
he shook the sleep from his eyes and the
clouds from his brain and stood at bay. The
minor Oppositionists, imagining him temporarily
down, yapped, snarled and wrangled. Crick stood with
his back up bluffing, abusing, threatening to go to the
country, and checking the wild, meteorological Dr. Ross,
who wanted to know the cause of weather, with a
honeyed w6rd. He held the House by the wool until the
absent sleepers arrived. Then he tdhl the Chairman,
with a grin that the rules of the House wouldn’t allow
him to leave the chair. He went on with other amend-
ments, and carried the defeated clause later in the
evening. What a pity that such a capable man should
assist in transforming what should be a dignified House
into a hack-yard where all the cats in creation hold forth
at night '

FAIR WARNING.
DICKY (with the pup): “Better look out what
you’re about, you blokes—he killed a China-
man once!”
“Ne’er-do-Weel”: With reference to
children “spitting their death” (B. 8/10/’O3).
Though this system appertains to the female
children in the Queensland bush and in Adelaide,
I have noticed a different custom among the
school children (female again) in Brisbane. Here,
the narrator who observes that her story is being
received with marks of disbelief suddenly breaks
off, places her finger in her mouth, withdraws it,
holds it up, and says solemnly, “That’s wet.”
Allowing this self-evident fact to soak into the
minds of her audience, she draws her finger sud-
denly across her throat, holds it up again, and
continues, “That’s dry. Gawd’ll cut my ’ead orf
if I tells a lie.” Then she goes on with her yarn.
There seems to be some analogy between these
ceremonies and certain aboriginal rites, not to
mention portions of the ritual of some Mutual
Millinery Lodges.

“ Cornelius ” : Man told me t’other day
that he once saw a number of crows flying up
with pebbles in their leaks, which they dropped
from aloft. On going over to investigate he
found a nest of emu eggs, which the birds were
tr\ing to break. 1 think he was au Ameri-
can ; I’m sure he was a liar.
They are cutting things pretty fine nowa-
days in Queensland. From the report of Dr.
Roth on the aboriginal mission station at Cape
Bedford, Far North (supported mainly, by the
way, by a Dutch society in Batavia): —
With the present prices ruling for flour, &c., the
Government grant of £250 is spent wholly and solely on
necessary rations, so that any bought clothing is out of
the question. Common decency, however, required that
the children should have a covering of some sort, a
difficulty which Mrs. Schwarz overcame by cutting up
calico flour-bags, piecing them together, and herself
doing all the sewing. During the past ten years she has
thus made some fifty pairs of trousers for the boys
attending school, and several dresses for the girls.
On another point Dr. Roth has this interesting
remark -
In the course of a conversation with the superintendent
as to the limits to the school subjects that should be
taught to our Australian natives, I learn that, after 17
years’ continuous residence among the Cape Bedford
blacks, he is in agreement with me in the view that no
practically useful results can possibly accrue by teaching
our mainland blacks composition, fractions, decimals, or
any other subjects that will in any way enable them to
come into competition with Europeans.

“Thurla”: The bush birds were forced
during the dry spring of 1902 to regulate their
families, owing to the hard times, and very little
nesting was done. But this spring the cries of
young birds fill the land. A pair of wagtails
built near my camp and reared a brood of three,
and as soon as they could fly one of the parents
started to build a new nest, whilst t’other attended
to the wants of the still dependent family. They
were shoving along the birth-rate.
* * » »
“Elmore”: Wonderful how tame bush
birds and animals become when not molested.
Have been camping alone for three weeks, and
already have half-a-dozen pets—magpies, wood-
peckers, and a jackass. On warm days a gohanna
sits placidly at the door waiting for scraps, never
heeding the magpies who snap viciously at him.
In the evenings a brown bush-rat runs fearlessly
about, foraging for crumbs, and a wag-tail
whistles half the night on the ridge pole, some-
times coming to the door and having a tuck-in.
Magpies are the worst-tempered, and also the
biggest thieves, and the hungriest. Their great
delicacy is centipedes. Have turned over logs
for them till I got tired ; one magpie had eaten 44
centipedes before I left off log-rolling. Then I
went back to the tent, and found that some other
magpies, helped by the gohanna, who had opened
the tucker-box for them, had taken possession.
No bread was left, the gohanna was finishing a
leg of mutton, and some billions of ants were
making themselves ill with jam. The bush-rat
had gorged himself into convulsions, while the
jackass was howling himself hoarse with delight.
In two seconds the slaughter was over. Hence-
forth bush pets are off.

Nhill (Vic.) whose worst crime to date is
that it gives Irvine a seat in the Assembly, has
entered into a solemn league and anti-wax-match
covenant. Every storekeeper, publican, and
tobacconist in the district has signed a bond
of £5 not to traffic in the inflammable vesta until
the hay and wheat season is over at the end of
February

“Brumby”: What a flow of “ skite ”
there is about the Horsetralian youth. Pass a
group of two or three standing in the street and
the chances are
10 to 1 you’ll
overhear one
relating, amidst
a critical sil-
ence, how he
“stoushed the
bloke wid a
brick’’and then
had to lay out
several police-
men before he
could get away.
H e describes
the hits and
other incidents
with appro-
priate gestures
and with a glow
of enthusiasm
quite foreign to
his usual air of
gloomy reserve.
The trait is just
as noticeable in
the other sex,
and Jane may
be heard drop-
ping her “h’s”
with dignified
acerbity as she tells her friend Mary
Ann just what she said to the missus
when remonstrated with by the old cat
for breaking a few plates and com-
ing home after midnight from the
“darnce.” The raconteur always
emerges from these encounters with triumph, the
enemy being routed with great slaughter. Per-
haps these aesthetic flights of imagination act as a
safety-valve, and prevent many a squalid tragedy.
When a man has killedsix policemen in his own
mind he has slaked his thirst for gore; but for this
outlet he might go and be very uncivil to one real
policeman.

W.A. Bushman writes :—•
Have ever your aboriginaliar woodcutters noticed what
appears an optical illusion in the bush when tree-felling
where straight sticks are required ? I have been a victim
many a time. Repeatedly I have sighted straight trees
from about 200 yards, but on approaching same have
found them as crooked as blazes. Have discovered the
reason of this, and now never make a mistake. You have
either to sneak on the tree, taking advantage of every
cover, or else rush it with all your might, with axe
behind you, before tree gets a chance to bend. If you
are not smart the trunk will curl 17 different ways.
Some of my majgs, when I told them this, said it was
too strong, even for a mining expert (which I am not,
because, although poor, I am honest) ; but when they
tried it they discovered I was right. It’s wonderful
what intelligence trees possess. Young salmon gum and
gimlet are very cunning. Had some experience in New
South Wales with mountain ash, which is frightful stuff
to warp when green. Have known it to warp itself into
a reef knot in two days, and Bxl battens would plait
themselves together like a stockwhip. Had a sawmill in
Kanimbla Valley, and the stuff was so restless that we
had to build a stockyard round it to keep it in bounds.
When we had a couple of truck loads cut, used to open
the sliprails, and the planks warped themselves to the
station right into trucks on the siding with the aid of
two sheepdogs.
“STEELE RUDD” AND HIS FAVORITE POLO PONY.
Photo, by Poul C. Poulsen, Brisbane.
“ Wanderer,” who says his address is
“Kicking Round the World,” writes from Floria
nopolis, Brazil: —
Australia experienced a rough time from the tick.
Here we have the tick also. The natural enemy of the
tick is a bird called the ano. These birds in great flocks
sweep over the open country here and clear the ticks off
the cattle. Might it not pay Australia—especially
Queensland —to import some of them with a view to their
acclimatisation ?
Australia has imported so many birds and animals,
and has fallen in so often, that it will probably
prefer to send Frank Farnell across as a Fishery
Commissioner to inspect the ano before buying.
If our local crow, who seems to have a good deal
of spare time on his feet, could be induced to
tackle the tick, or if the rabbit would learn to
run him down and bite him, it would certainly be
better than fooling with new fowl that might go
back on us.

“ G.H.” : The Mongol who supplies my
house with vegetables (none being obtainable from
any other source) brings daily bunches of flowers
and offers same at the shrine of Maly Ann.
Maly Ann, who is a humorous female, at
times affects coyness, and it is most touch-
ing to hear the Chow Romeo whisper pain-
fully, “ You likee losheebud (rosebud),
Maiy Ann ? Plitty losheebud.” The red-
haired Juliet is an expensive charmer,
and leaves Wing very little cash for fan-
tan or pak-a-pu ; in addition to flowers he
has to further bribe her with about half
a cwt. of preserved ginger per week. Wing
is a bit of a humorist, too, and occa-
sionally pretends, in a high - )Itched,
chrome voice, to be the “ Butchel ! ” or the
“ Bakel !” or some other tradesman. And
when Mary shoves her head hastily forth
and yells “ threepounderchops,” the simple
joy of that Chow is just like the joy of the
domestic magpie or tame raven that has
come up behind the mooning cat and barked,
thus making the animal leap three feet in
its sudden surprise.
“ Tambo ”: At a bush shanty out
West (temperature 115 in the shade) one of
half-a-dozen men who were Xmasing died
suddenly, and his mates, desirous of giving
him decent burial, adjourned with the corpse
to an adjacent sand-hill, where, after clumsily
covering defunct, they sang with due solemnity
“The Ship that Never Returned.” Having
thus done their best by their departed brother
they returned to “fill ’em up again.”
“ Rypo ” : “The prospects for a record
harvest are excellent.” “A record wheat-yield is
anticipated in this district.”—(Extracts from any
recent paper in Victoria.) Hence, the next
trouble with the poor farmer will be a shortage of
harvesting hands. Then the Government will be
approached with some violence for help. Men
will be wanted from the Solomon Islands, South
Pole—any where. The good old socialistic farmer
man is sure to be on top of his haystack yelling
for State aid, whatever happens.

“ Kerani ” : The Bairnsdale correspon-
dent of the Argus got in a good one recently
about a schoolboy who induced a swarm of bees
to settle on his waistcoat, walked a quarter of
a mile to the school with the insects, put them
into a box, and did not get a sting. I do not
know the dimensions of this correspondent, so
I’ll not call him names. I only know that I
myself once acted as a conveyance for part of
a swarm of bees for about half a mile, through
pretty rough country. I don’t know whether the
insects were satisfied with their trip or not, but
I got all I wanted. My brother (who was present
when I started) says there were only four bees on
me altogether, and two of them were blowflies,
but you can’t take much notice of him—he wasn’t
brought up as strictly as I was.
The luck of the Victorian Mallee cocky is
awful. Last year he came in hundreds to S.W.
Victoria and struck the driest time experienced in
those parts for 50 years. While battling with
almost insurmountable difficulties in the south he
missed the only good season up north for 10
years. Now the caterpillars have been going
through his crops, and leaving nothing but the
headless straw. It is about 13 years since S.W.
Victoria was last visited with this pest.

“D.H.R.”: “Myall” writes (B. 26/11/’O3)
about closer settlement and a few other things —
amongst them bores. But “ Myall ”is wrong—
radically wrong. “In Walgett district crops are
looking magnificent,” says “Myall.” They are !
Many cookies have had all their crops spoilt by
rust. As a last resource —in lieu of stripping—
they have cut them for hay ; and every one of
them has now 70 or 80 tons for sale, and cannot
sell half-a-pound. They have lost all their sheep
in the drought, had all prospect of stripping
A SUBTLE HEATHEN.
“Look here, Jimmy Too Sing; don’t you send
that cousin of yours round here any more.
He’s a regular fool.”
JIMMY (her silent admirer) : “Not such a foolee
as you tink, Katie. When he come home
yesterday I say to him, ‘ Well, and how
Katie?' He look at me and say, ‘Oh, Mrs
Jimmy Too Sing? She welly well indeed,
tank you!”
spoilt by the rain, and have paid away £2O or £3O
in wages to harvest their hay. Far be it from me
to condemn closer settlement, but not in a district
where there is no manufacturing population to
provide a market. “A great future !” Two
eockies swore heartily when they saw that remark
of “ Myall’s.” ,

“J. Carew ” : After dark, every night,
we hear at intervals, carried along the ground,
and conveying no idea of distance or direction, a
long plaintive boom. The line runs in our memo-
ries, “The bittern booms.” Are there bitterns
in Australia ? And what is a bittern ? And why
and how does it boom ? In many years’ bush-life
have never heard the sound before.
A THREEPENNY DOSS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mystic seance, strange communion hold I in the doss-
house here ;
There are many spirits present, also many brands of beer.
Comes to my discerning nostril from the man in bunk
below
H raith of Rum —it came from Queensland not so very
long ago.
It has taken to tobacco even in its fiery youth,
And its label very likely indicates its scorn of truth.
Unsophisticated spirit loveth not to scoff and jeer
At its derelict disciples dossing by the dozen here !
From an evidently fresh and most adjacent son of toil
Wicked reek of Whisky rises garbed in fiery fusel oil.
Spirit born of humble parents—“ poor but honest” if you
will,
Save occasional connection with a bush illicit still.
Bred they this rebellious spirit, which developed as it
grew
Great reluctance of increasing Edward Rex’s revenue.
And the early introduction of companions exercised
Influence that left their offspring thoroughly demoralised.
Bushmen drank it, for the bushman loves a spirit that
can fight—
Yea, he almost worships whisky warranted to slay at
sight.
Jamborees of joy gigantic 1 Sprees of infinite excess !
Drunks defying all describing, awful in their sinfulness 1
But I tarry, other spirits astral apprehension sees ;
Let us leave this spirit to his damned indecent devotees.
Biting ghost in bunk above me ! More transparent fraud
perhaps!
Name coincidental merely, or did humor name it
Schnapps ?
Once “white sprit,” cheap and nasty, till man’s
inhumanity
Unto man made countless thousands drink of it un-
wittingly.
Blend of subtle toxic agents such as set the brain aflame,
How it gloats above its victim’s tattered livery of shame !
Spirit that parades as Brandy haunts the dosser over
there;
Brandy? Not by many jugs full! That’s the demon’s
“nom de guerre.”
Possibly potato spirit; stranger to the soil of France.
‘ Brandy ” on the label ? Bless you, that is but a circum-
stance !
Generous the juice of grape is, never serves disciples
thus.
This disciple wouldn’t drink it—likes it less innocuous.
I, however, am digressing—time for persiflage is past
While yon terrifying spectre looms abnormally and vast.
’Tis the dominating demon, boss of all Beelzebubs ;
Beer—the fetish of their worship—all these sweepings of
the pubs !
Bah! these fearsome exhalations! I am sick at sight
and smell—
Noisome devils populating this, their temporary hell.
Choked with devils ! Breathing devils ! Devils, devils
everywhere !
Watchman, let me out of Hades ! Ah 1 the blessed,
blessed air!

“Ess.”: Precautions are being taken at
many places in N.S.W. to guard against bush
fires, the risk of which is unusually great this
year in consequence of there being little stock
beyond caterpillars to keep down the prolific
growth of grass that followed the rains. Settlers
are forming themselves into amateur fire brigades,
and each man is pledged to look carefully round
himself every five minutes for smoke, and to keep
a telescopic eye and a blunderbuss on any chance
swagman who obtrudes on the horizon. New
handles are wedged into tomahawks, and the
wood axe is ground in readiness for chopping
bushes, and a supply of bags tied on the ends of
sticks is kept on hand. Instructions have been
given to station-masters to transmit telegraphic
and telephonic messages free of cost, so that
when Jones drops a match, or a spark from
his pipe, he can ring up Smith and Robin-
son to come and put their conjoint foot
on it and prevent a national disaster. Wax
matches are taboo for three months, and store-
keepers are asked to sell nothing but safeties
(made in Germany). It is rather amusing to note
that the persons who started all the hubbub anent
the anticipated blaze are those who drive about in
buggies, with “refreshers” under the seat, and
shy empty bottles out as they go along. A bottle
and a hot sun will start a fire very quickly in dry
grass—and the unwary swagman, who happens to
Eass the bottle within reasonable time of the out-
reak, runs a big risk of being lynched.

A cry from Maoriland :
Recently attended a Farmers’ Union picnic. Of all
mean, niggardly affairs it took the bun. Trains arrived
up till dinner-time. People mooned around the one-horse
township looking for the picnic. At 2 o’clock a youth
with a cracked bell went round informing intending
picnickers to roll up “ in the paddock back of the pub.”
They went and found a five-acre paddock to stare at each
other in. There was just about nothing to eat. An
hour before train time some superannuated old fogies
stood on a beer-barrel and shouted long addresses about
the glorious union of its members. Some girl races were
run, the winners receiving lucky-packets. Then the
show shut up for the night.
POLITENESS IN THE BUSH.
NAVVY: “Hi, Miss, you’ve dropped a bow-yang.”
“ Scallywag ” : Might I be permitted to
suggest to the Ovve’Sullivan that with the money
intended for “Australia Facing the Bill,” he
might import some species which in time would
supplant Macropus Major as the emblem of Aus-
tralia? The ’roo, whose chief accomplishments
are jumping and eating, is a public aspersion.
“ 0.C.” I was travelling between Car-
coar and Cowra (N.S.W.) one hot, dusty, mid-
summer day. Coach crowded, passengers listless
and thirsty. Pulled up to water horses and re-
fresh generally at a roadside pub known as “ The
Sheet of Bark,” and kept by Jack Lynch, a
brother of Andrew, who for some time
represented Carcoar in N.S.W. Leg.
Assembly. The passengers quickly dis-
mounted and swarmed into the bar.
Jack was attending, but he had nothing
to sell, “Not a drop av anything.
They were burying old Mrs. O’Some-
thing yesterday in the little cemetery
beyant, and the mourners drank me out
of every drop I had.” There is a little
cemetery about a quarter-of-a-mile from
the Sheet of Bark, and we glanced list-
lessly at Mrs. O’Something’s grave as
we went on our way dry. Andrew
Lynch, brother of the host of The Sheet
of Bark, was a quaint “cuss.” When
member for Carcoar a constituent hur-
ried out to his home one day with the
intelligence that a certain road-in-
spectorship was vacant, and the con-
stituent wanted Andy to get it for him.
As an incentive, he added: “There’s
,£4OO a year hanging to it.” “Is there,”
said Andy: “well, make your mind
aisy, for I’ll apply for the billet for
myself.” Members were not paid in
Andrew Lynch’s day.
* * * *
Though the Rabbit Act has been
in force for several months the N.S.W.
Government has made no move towards
destroying the rabbits on reserves which
are, as a rule, densely timbered and
inaccessible to trappers. Owners of
land are compelled to destroy rabbits,
but where privately owned land abuts on
unoccupied Crown lands the owner
hasn’t Buckley’s chance of keeping his
land free from the pest. The Government should
be treated as a private owner, liable to prosecu-
tion for not destroying its rabbits.
“Ku Klux”: Apropos of nothing in
particular, I spent a day in Jerilderie once. It
was Federal-referendum day,
and we were building a wool-
shed at a station close by.
Nineteen men decided to take
a day to go and record their
votes. After a wild and woolly
time we all got back safely
except one man ; he had been
run in, but turned up later.
Being curious to know how
all had voted, I canvassed the
nineteen, and found that six-
teen had clean forgotten all
about the yes or no question
till after the booths closed.
One of the remaining three had
carefully scratched out “ No,”
then as carefully wrapped up
the paper, and put it in his pocket, where
it was found next day. The second had written,
“Ned Kelly was the best blanky man ever
was in this town,” and he also pocketed it.
The third wrote: “This blanky country is
going to perdition.” How did I vote ? I was one
of the sixteen.

A correspondent, writing to S.A.
Advertiser, thus describes the growth of
wheat in Victoria The crops are higher
than the fences, and so thick and heavy that they
can neither be cut with the binder nor reaped
with the harvester, and will probably have to be
cut with axes.”
THE SELECTOR’S WIFE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Her husband’s gone where husbands go, when droughts
are hard out-back,
And rents are due and wheat-crops fail—to face the
droving track.
All through the long, lone day she lives a soulless, aim-
less life,
Environed by the solitudes that speak to her of strife.
And watches from her homestead door the saffron whirl-
winds rise
And mournful move across the plain, their spouts turned
to the skies.
She sees the dancing mirage like a ruffl.'d lakelet gleam,
The throbbing, flowing heat-waves rise like colonnades of
steam.
The unrelenting sun-flames beat around her sere, dry
home,
And nought but phantom cloudlets rise to deck the
steely dome.
She sees the setting of the sun—the rising of the moon —
And soft she hears across the bush the sunset breezes
croon ;
She sees the dusky night come down, and one by one the
stars
Drift into sight; and, rustling low, she hears the bush
belars.
She sees the brilliant, sad stars shine, and hears the
sough of trees,
And far across the flattened earth the sighing of the
AorossHflie Godforsaken Land the distant curlews call,
And deep within her heart she feels the pathos of it all.
And from the tortuous road that funs the clumps of
timber through
She sees the gleam of travellers’ fires ascending to the
blue.
The wild swan calls above her home, the wild duck
answers back,
And far within the forest gloom she hears the dry limbs
And then some night the sound of hoofs she hears adown
The house dogs bark—she knows it is her husband
coming back.

No notice (except of a hostile character) will be taken of
communications insufficiently stamped. Name and
address must appear on MS. No liability is under-
taken in any case re contributions voluntarily sub-
mitted, whether sent by post or handed in ; and in
no case will MS. be returned unless stamps (of any
State) accompany.
M.R. : Sorry to say see no sign of promise
about them J.F.B. : “Good of the Year ” is a mystery.
Heaven only knows what it is about.. ..Val J. : “ Years
Between” rather old idea set to slow music.. ..Helen
D.: “Song of Youth” doesn’t get there A.B.H. :
“ One Sure Thing ” just misses the mark. Try again....
W.F. : “Voice in the Silence” rather too faint....
D.8.G.: Declined, but not far off standard—J.K.Z.: The
reason why very little save scorn appears in this column
is that the man who sends good stuff isn’t answered ; he
is simply paid.... Vic. : “Query” rather too queer....
F.D. : “Forget” is too wild in its metre, and only a
kissy-kissy little thing at best Weston : “Light that
Failed ” declined J.A. : Sometimes we feel inclined to
d—n “Out-Back.” S.M.W. : “Conscience” simply
dreadful Dan V.: Ponderous without being effective—
Inland Australian: Reason for rejection is simply that
you haven’t the beginning of an idea how to write verse.
G.Y. :No use for “10.45 p.m.” D.M.R. : “Rua-
pehu” declined... .J.8.W.: “Good Shed” humorous,
but too crude. “Memories” just commonplace
Lassa: “Shadow” is only the shadow of a shade....
Hugh Stone : No demand here for verses in praise of
“ fiscal peace.” Bulletin is looking for fiscal war —the
goriest kind—till we get a really high tariff... ..W.J.N.
(Vic.): “Bushman’s Lament” very commonplace verse.
Ring-Gidya: “He and She” rather shadowy and
scrappy Bandar: The man who asks us how to
improve his work asks a big question. The whole duty
of a story-writer is to be interesting. If we could
tell anyone how to be that, then it would be possible
to tell a pork-butcher how to be a god
M.E.E.M. : Hardly up.. ..0.L.D.: And you don’t even
spell the man’s name rightly Cam : Rather feeble in
places.... Esme : Don’t care for it....Gazob : Too like a
yarn we printed a couple of years back J. March
NATURAL PRECAUTION.
“ Why do you cover up that horse so in this weather?”
“I'm afraid of his ketchin ’ fire. The grass I’ve been feedin ’ him on has been that dry that
it may be a case of natural combustion only for that ’ere rag.”
Stiff and awkward 8.F.: Humor rather labored
Sunny Jim : Out of our line, and cost us Is. 4d. as being
in aii envelope “closed against inspection.” Bobs:
Feeble and inartistic The Prodigal: Hardly up.
Mizpah : Crude Ury : Merely returned in the
ordinary way.... Libi: Too slow and'wooden.. ..Horace
G • Not enough in it T.H.0.: Stereotyped kind of
hero story F.P.: Painful humor... .Gowk : Stiff in
the joints Tricotrin : You straggle around too much,
J.8.R.: Good story, spoilt by absolute lack of
the gift of narration Free Detectionist: (1) The
increase in deposits in British Savings Banks was first
quoted by Geo. Reid in your city as unanswerable proof
of the progress caused by Freetrade, therefore it is fair to
show that savings grew in other countries also. (2) As to
what has become of Britain’s lands : 13,500,000 acres are
not used for any agricultural or pastoral purpose ; about
58,000,000 acres, much of it once cultivated, are now
used for grazing purposes. (3) Mulhall didn’t use’the
words you quote, and it wasn’t pretended that he did;
he simply supplied the figures. As to what good
such comparisons serve, ask your Freetrade crowd. ..
D.T.D. : Material pretty good, but far too many words.
... Turbine: Not our fault. Your directions should
have been more explicit... .Will T. : Remarkably un-
equal. Are you sure it’s all your own?....Meg : Per-
fectly versed, but it lacks the essential backbone of mean-
ing.... Wirra : A hopelessly' discredited theory, according
to recent lights upon the matter B.F. : Not swing
wTfeturned. S.D W. 8 : haTbeen’ won"!
but not much Trimmer : " Near the mark
Geo. K. : Much too long for interest.. .‘/D.M.R. :
Can’t read your poem; the transfer sheet of
your typewriter only worked in patches and the transfer
vou send us drops half of most of the lines.. ..M.O.M. :
We’ve already published that Melba fact; one fact one
par... .Silver Top : Your pars are interesting and most of
them will find their way into print. When you exhaust a
subject on which you have special knowledge you may
not find results so good A.B. : Perhaps you are an
A.B. as a seaman ; as a writer you steer the crookedest
course we’ve yet experienced ; copy absolutely unread-
able... .William Flood : Without a doubt the British dm
use Dum-Dum bullets in the earlier stages of the S’African
war. We have it now on the confession of the War Office.
W.W. : Thanks for irrigation matter, which Will use
some day. (1) The State should never part with the fee
simple of any bit of land it gets a title to ; a great mis-
take has been made in alienating any land, (Z) xou
don’t make the question quite clear, but an unimproved
land value tax would simply pass by land which had no
value in its present unimproved state ; it has toP as ® OV ?T
many thousands of acres in N.S.W J.A.8.: We should
say that “ a thorough-bred Australian ” was a white, born
in Australia of two white Australia-born parents. Of
course, our ancestors were imported, but probably the
ancestors of the aborigines were also. The Maoris canoe
to their islands from some other country ; the English-
man’s ancestors mostly arrived from the continent; the
Franks imported themselves into France—in fact, it is
difficult to say where there are any real aborigines
B R N. : Couldn’t print that on your mere assertion....
E de L. : The man who told you that yarn wasn t
original ...C.G.W. : It wasn’t your caligraphy that
caused the mistake, but your want of it. You had no
caligraphy about you Nemo: Can’t say, but Nemo
is an unfortunate pen-name used by many people. Why
not call yourself Gehazi or Jeroboam or Ashur?... .tell
In: Not so vigorous as it might be.... Byrne: Rather
rugged, but vigorous, so here goes on general principles :
J. Thomson (Fremantle) : No; Lydia Thompson never
played in Australia. She went from England to America
and stayed there many years, returning with a burlesque
co. in which her principal accomplice was Willie Edouin.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC) CONTRIBUTORS.
A Pedder : “ Arrival of Ada C.” picture shows as
mostly glare and roses... .Violet J. : Hardly good enough.
C.E.A. : Sketch rather weak and joke only a pun
A.T.J. (Uralla) : You send us one of our own pictures
(stolen and reproduced by Bits) with Norman Lindsay's
signature on it ; and you want to be paid for it as a
suggestion. You are a cheerful person A.K.C. : Very
aboriginal style of art.. . .Robo : Very rough, and jokes
hardly good enough to make sketchesworth re-drawing..
T. StOne : Received three old Bulletin pictures, evidently
cut out of thief papers, and marked “Suggestion.”
What are you driving at? A.C.T. : Drawing repulsive.
....Nemo : Will serve as suggestion.. ..Wisp : “No One
Knows” will be kept a dark secret so far as we are con-
cerned J.O. : Hardly suggests Gordon J.S.H. :
With careful study and good tuition you should improve.
S.A.S. : Just horrible B.F.C. : Very crude
W. O’B. : One will do as suggestion A. Williams :
Ditto H.W. : Gaspipe joke no good F.A.B. : Wild
microbe joke useless.
WHERE THE DRY BONES BAKE.
I’ve tramped far out, and I’ve knocked about
In the western drought-cursed land
Where the swagmen tire and the sun strikes fire
On the hungry wastes of sand.
Where the dry bones bake and the deadly snake
Reigns king of the reeking corpse,
And the bleaching skull, that is void and null,
That the blist’ring red sun warps.
Where the gaunt trees stand on the scorching sand,
In the mirage like spectres grim,
With a fiery brand in each fleshless hand,
And death on each fleshless limb.
'Tis the land of doubt, where the brave snuff out
Who follow the Dead-Man-Track
To the goal accursed with eternal thirst—
To th« Western Hell “ Out Back.*

and you will continue to suffer unless the disorder is treated, as it ought to be treated, by striking
direct at the cause. All the disorders mentioned are due to one cause and one cause alone; namely
the disability of the
KIDNEYS AND LIVER
to perform the work allotted to them in Nature’s Scheme. Nature will tolerate no irregularity.
When the kidneys and liver are working perfectly, it is impossible for anyone to suffer from any
of the disorders named. In order that this important fact may be realised, the following description
of the work performed by those vital organs is given :
The Kidneys filter and extract from the blood about three pints of urine every day. In this
quantity of urine are dissolved about an ounce of urea, ten to twelve grains in weight of uric acid,
together with other animal and mineral matter varying from a third of an ounce to nearly an ounce,
When the kidneys are in health, all this solid matter is in solution and is invisible. Directly the
kidneys, through either weakness or disease, become unfit to do their duty properly, a proportion of
the solid matter remains in the blood, becomes actively poisonous and causes us to suffer from uric
disorders such as Rheumatism, Gout, Neuralgia, Lumbago, Backache, Sciatica, Gravel,
Stone, Bladder Troubles, and Bright’s Disease. A simple test to make as to the condition
of the kidneys is to place some urine, passed the first tiling in the morning, in a covered glass, and
let it stand until next morning. If it is then cloudy, or there is a brick-dust like sediment, or if
particles float about in it, or it is of an unnatural color, the kidneys are not healthy, and no time must
be lost in adopting remedial measures, or Bright’s Disease, Diabetes, or some less serious but more
painful illness will result.
The Liver. —ln the liver various substances are actually made from the blood. Two or three
pounds of bile are thus made from the blood every day. The liver takes sugar from the blood,
converts it into another form, and stores it up so as to be able to again supply it to the blood,
gradually, as the latter requires enrichment. The liver changes uric acid, which is insoluble, into
urea, which is completely soluble, and the liver also deals with blood corpuscles which have lived their
life and are useful no longer. When the liver is inactive or diseased we suffer from Indigestion,
Biliousness, Anaemia, Sick Headache and Blood Disorders.
The health of the liver and of the kidneys is so closely connected that it is almost impossible for
the kidneys to be affected, and the liver to remain healthy, or vice versa.
It is nearly thirty years since scientific research, directed specially to diseases of the Kidneys
and Liver, was rewarded by the discovery of the medicine now known throughout the world as
Warner’s Safe Cure. It was realised, at the outset of the investigation, that it was necessary
to find a, curative agent which would act equally upon the kidneys and upon the liver, these
organs being so immediately associated in the work of dealing with the body’s waste material, and,
after many disappointments, the medicine which possessed the required action in the fullest
degree was at length discovered. Warner’s Safe Cure cures all diseases of the kidneys
and liver, and, by restoring their activity, these vital organs are enabled to rid the body, through
the natural channels, of the urinary and biliary poisons, the presence of which in the system, are the
cause of Rheumatism, Gout, Neuralgia, Lumbago, Backache, Sciatica, Blood Disorders, Anaemia,
Indigestion, Biliousness, Jaundice, Sick Headache, Gravel, Stone, Bladder Troubles, and General
Debility. Warner’s Sate Cure cures all these disorders simply by removing the cause of the disorder.
This is the reason why cures effected by Warner’s Safe Cure are permanent cures.

hope of recovery was despaired of, will be sent post free, by H. H. Warner and Co’., Limited,

Salvarmy Culls for Australia.
This amazing item of information comes from
Westralia
Perth, Thursday.—The Minister for Lands has arranged
with the’Salvation Army regarding immigration on the
following lines: —The Army authorities in England to
nominate immigrants at the office of the Agent-General,
the immigrants to pay half the boat passage, and the
Government the other half; if the immigrant remains in
the State, or resides for six months on the land selected
for him by the Crown, the passage money to be refunded
bv the Government; the commission to be paid to the
Army or persons nominating such immigrant at any time,
after the passage money is refunded will be : Single men,
£2 per head ; married men, £3 per head, with three chil-
dren, £si The Minister is willing to negotiate similarly
with other religious bodies.
Apparently the case may be condensed thus :
(1) The Salvarmy selects the immigrants from its own
crowd, consisting mostly of the wastrels of the slums —
from among the ignorant, feeble-minded characters
with the retreating chins and retreating foreheads, who
are the slaves of Booth and the abject followers of the
big drum.
(2) Westralia supplies these wasters with land.
(3) Westralia pays their passages in full if they remain
six months in the country.
(4) Westralia also pays £2 per head to the Army—
£2o,ooo for 10,000 slum wrecks who will vote as the Army
tells them to, and waste the State’s substance by sending
it to Booth, and who will bring the physical degeneracy
of the back lanes of the big English cities to taint the
blood of Australia.
In view of the fact that the Australian Govern-
ment lias exclusive power to make laws dealing
with immigration, it is to be hoped that it will
deal energetically with this proposal to plant
colonies of Booth’s underfed and physically
degenerate serfs in Australia. The population of
Australia is increasing just now at the rate of
over 53,000 a year. Its case isn’t so bad that
it needs to import the culls of any sect or creed.
Especially it doesn’t want to have its population
selected for it by any pope, bishop, priest, parson,
or big-drum howler. The Westralian agreement
represents the last extreme of lunacy- On the
terms offered Westralia’s own agents could get
the best agricultural classes in England, and
could save the commission or head money that it
is to pay the Army for exporting Booth’s cast-offs.
The M.L. Globe-Trotter.
A shout from Maoriland :
Everything seems to indicate that Maoriland aims at
becoming a side-show for the benefit of the ignorant
globe-trotter. It is really pathetic to observe the eager-
ness of the Government, which is firmly convinced that
the tourist, being the only specimen of the human race
who brings cash into a country without taking any out of
it, is the sort of thing that cannot be too much en-
couraged. You can’t go into the smallest and most
tenth-rate township without meeting a Tourist Bureau.
The Government has a Tourist Department, with scores
of high-paid officials; it advertises extensively in the
English papers about the dusky Maori maidens and the
amazing geysers ; it sits up nights thinking out new ways
to bring the tourist to the country ; it has imported huge
quantities of fish and game, and is going to import wild
beasts for the tourists to shoot at; and it acts generally
as if the salvation of the place depended on the arrival of
the person with a monocle and a vacant stare, and that,
if he doesn’t come, the islands may as well relapse into
oblivion forthwith. The other day, the farmers of the
roadless and boggy section of Hawke’s Bay determined to
get a road so as to cart their milk to the creameries.
Accordingly they represented to the Government that,
away back at Whakaremomona, there was some hair-
raising scenery that the tourist ought to see, and the
Govt, got up in its nightshirt and immediately voted the
money for the road. The most ludicrously pathetic in-
stance of the Govt.’s anxiety to attract the tourist
was the clause in Seddon’s Licensing Bill which pro-
vided that a tourist might obtain a license to drink in
the prohibited areas, although it was proposed to make it
an--offence for anyone, except the Government Agent who
supplied tourists, to have a single drop of alcohol in his
possession, in those districts. It isn’t possible to pick up
a city newspaper without seeing ten or a dozen para-
graphs about the Tourist Bureau, and how many gallons
it perspired in the preceding 24 hours in its efforts to
write up a spicy advertisement to catch the tourist, and
how it had purchased cigars and whisky for the tourist,
and how it is making arrangements to eventually lie
down and let every tourist have a free walk over its joint
and collective body. It is the only real enthusiasm, the
only hobby of the Government. Whisper “ tourist,” and
the Government rushes up frantically, and buys you a
drink, and leans its ear up against you with feverish
anxiety for any sort of a suggestion you have to make.
Now, this is a young State, with lots of possibilities and a
lot to do before it can put on frills and take an evening
off. What it ought to do is to put on its moleskins, and
go to bed early, and get up early, and hustle vigorously,
and pay its debts, and gradually get quit of Bull-Coiie'n,
and eventually get a credit balance. It can do so easily
enough ; but as long as it has the tourist notion on the
brain, arid looks hungrily for his money, and believes
that it must remain poor unless it gets money from out-
side, it won’t be in the proper frame of mind for honest
work. There isn’t an instance on record of any country
amounting to anything which places its trust in the
arrival of people who say “Haw!” at the geysers and
glac.ers, and that is what Maoriland is doing more and
more every day.
Sydney Consecrated Press on the debate in
N.S.W. Assembly on Arthur Griffith’s Bill to
education absolutely free :
By bringing forward once more the question of free
education, Mr. Arthur Griffith hoped, we presume, to
gain some popular favor in his Senatorial campaign. He
will probably find that he was mistaken in his hopes.
There is no popular demand for pauper schools. . . . The
most extraordinary feature of the debate was the attitude
of certain Catholic members of the House. The election
of a Catholic to Parliament is usually regarded as a gain
to the Catholic community. It is generally thought that
at least they will put the Catholic case when the occasion
arises, and endeavor to prevent injustice. But here we
find Catholic members like Messrs. M’Mahon, Daley,
Dacey, Burgess, Sullivan, Power, Gormly, D. Mac-
Donell, and Fitzpatrick voting for a proposal to still
f urther penalise Catholics in the matter of education. . . .
Catholics have certainly nothing to gain by the presence
of such men in Parliament, and the sooner they face their
constituents the better.
It is piffle of this sort which is largely responsible
' Dill-Mackyism. Fortunately, the great mass
of Roman Catholics ignore it, and the mischievous
rag which prints it, just as the great mass of Pro-
testants ignore the shrieksome campaign of Dill
Macky. The Bulletin would not give the
matter the notoriety of republication but for the
fact that the squeal of the Green Pig paper shows
again, what has been patent to every fair-minded
man since Cardinal Moran’s defeat at the Federal
convention elections, that the Roman Catholics of
the community don’t vote as R.C.’s and are not in
any numbers influenced by their spiritual leaders
in matters of polities. Here we have a list of R.C.
members, from all sides of the House, refusing to
follow the wishes of their church in a matter of
politics. There could be no clearer proof of the
want of logical basis for the Dill Macky madness.
From the report of an interview with Editor
Mather, of Johannesburg Tribune, who was
lately visiting London :
“ The British, the men who have sacrificed everything
during the war and for whom nominally that war was
entered upon, are more bitter against Lord Milner and
the domination of the financiers than the Dutch them-
selves. ’
“ Is the position, then, worse to-day than it was before
the war?”
‘ Incredibly worse. We had a certain freedom under
the Dopper rule ; there is none under the rule of De
Beers. Even a public meeting cannot be held without
permission of the authorities.”
(( And the authorities are ? ”
‘ The creatures of the financiers almost to a man.”
“Viator” : Next to the Capitol, nothing
interests you so much in Washington as the
Smithsonian Institute. Its history is very pecu-
liar. Smithson, who died in 1829, aged 64, was a
natural son of the Duke of Northumberland, and
did not consider himself well-treated on the
father’s side. However, he inherited a large for-
tune from relatives of his mother, a widow named
Made. Smithson said, “I will do something to
make my name remembered for ever, when the
Northumberlands are all forgotten, and kings
have perished from the earth.” He was an
irreconcilable Republican, though English,
but had never been in America. He
bequeathed all his property to the _U.S.
Government, to found a Smithsonian Institute,
for the increase and diffusion of knowledge. The
amount was £104,000. The institute was not
founded till 1846, by which time the money had
swelled up greatly, and a number of other con-
tributions were added. The outcome is the
greatest scientific institution in America, and
Smithson is reckoned in the front rank of the
national benefactors. The Smithsons of Nor-
thumberland now call themselves Percy, but the
institute throws the old plain family name at them
like an unburied crime.

DIARRHOEA.
Diarrhoea, in its first stages, can be cured by
a few doses of that pleasant, reliable, and effec-
tual medicine, Chamberlain’s Colic and Diar-

sufficient, but as a rule three or four doses are
necessary. It is a good thing to keep in the
house. Get a bottle to-day; it may save a life.*

seems endless and you would again like to feel the fire of
youth in your veins and the pride of life in your heart—
you should consult those great medical experts connected);
with the medical staff of the Freeman and Wallace

throughout Australasia. They have cured more men of
their troubles and secured more medical triumphs than i
any similar association of medical men in Australia.
Their Institute, upon the scientific detail of which over

A DOG AND ITS DUTY.
“Last elections these Protectionists came crawling along and
said, ‘Let us have fiscal peace; let us return good Protectionists;
never mind their Protection; it is not a thing to divide good,
honest men.’ But the moment they got the power they showed
their teeth —both rows of them—and brought down a wretched
system of taxation.” —GEORGE REID.
This is an allegorical representation of the way
they showed their teeth.
“ As a work of fiction, Sydney Telegraph
is well worth a penny.”—G. H. Reid a while
ago.
From Kalgoorlie (W.A.):
Piggott’s no-confidence motion in W.A. Assembly
failed to shift anything. Piggott seemed most hurt
by the threatened invasion of rabbits, but most people
realise that Piggott as Premier would be a worse calamity
even than rabbits.
Laborite Prendergast jerked in a neat but
unfinished interjection during the discussion on
the Vic. Assembly Electorates Bill: “Footscray
is, in sentiment, as far away from Melbourne as is
Geelong; indeed, the natural boundary between
Footscray and Melbourne is a bad smell.” Two
srne'ls, Mr. Prendergast. Melbourne smells of
land-banks ; Footscray, of bone-mills.
More Melbourne Age remarks on Irvine :
The system of borrowing from trust funds in the hope
that good times will enable repayments to be made has
been adopted, with the result that a practice has been
followed which, if copied by private institutions, would
land the officials in the dock.
One very loud joke last week was the
tremendous speech of Mr. “Jack” Want on the
blessings of Freetrade, and his denunciation of
trimmers of all sorts. And Mr. “ Jack ’’ Want
was the sham Freetrader who was violently
ejected from office for “sneaking in Protection”
in Jennings’ time, not so many years ago.
Melba's popper, old Dave Mitchell, has
offered the Victorian Government 2000 acres of
land “suitable for closer settlement.” Needless
to mention that Mr. Mitchell doesn’t propose to
present this bit of his adopted country to the
Government as a Xmas box, but wants to sell it
(probably for more money than any private
purchaser would pay). Therefore his proposal is
public-spirited, in a sense.
Ex-Home Secretary Foxton (Q.) has a
curious record on franchise matters. He sup-
ported the property vote consistently from the
first, till 1901. Has supported since then one-
adult-one-vote and the baby vote; and, later, he
came forward in furtherance of a queer Bill com-
mingling the old property vote with the female
franchise. Airey (Labor member) dubbed him
the Apostle of Lop-sided Franchise.
The Tasmanian Legislative Council, has
now thrown out every item of the Propsting Gov-
ernment’s Reforn programme—its rejection, by 14
votes to 4, of the new Electoral Bill is the last
straw. It is no use for Propsting or anyone else
to be a reforming Premier in Tasmania without a
reliable scheme for slaying the Upper House as
part of the programme; he might as well be a
dervish, or something in a museum.
Premier See, of N.S.W., has at last sent
in his bill to the Australian Government for pro-
perties taken over. He claims £4,000,000 and
interest from the time the properties were trans-
ferred. Treasurer Turner’s reply about the back
interest is so businesslike as to be almost snappish.
He has returned to N.S.W, the three-fourths of
its customs and excise revenue mentioned in the
Constitution, and enough in addition to cover the
interest See talks of twice over. He couldn’t at
the time say what part of the returned money was
interest on See’s bill for properties taken over, for
owing to See’s slowness in supplying the bill he
couldn’t tell what the interest would be. But
See got the interest whether it was called interest
or not, and, if See doesn’t like it, Turner reckons
See can lump it.
Extract from the Australian
Leather Journal, 15/10/’O3
Tiie Exodus from Australia.— A London
correspondent, who is in touch with leading
manufacturers in England, and therefore
in a fairly good position to “ feel the
pulse ” of the world’s progress, as it were,
writes as follows “ Australia seems to
me to be the most stagnant and least
attractive place, in a business sense, on
the civilised globe at the present time.”
This opinion would seem to be shared by
many local people. New South Wales has
lost in actual population (excess over im-
migration) over 7000 people in a little
over twelve months , Victoria, 4000 odd ;
and Queensland a considerable number
Every steamer from Australian ports takes
away people to Canada, the United States,
South Africa, Maoriland, and other coun-
tries. Many of the people are known to
have considerable capital, and, in many
cases, whole families have gone. For this
condition of things the drought is largely
responsible, but much is due to our out-
rageous labor legislation, which has deter-
mined many employers—the very class a
new country wants—to depart ‘to lands
where they will be allowed to develop their
business in peace. We deserve all this if
we allow the affairs of the country to be
conducted by men whose economic, poli-
tical, and general knowledge is below, in-
stead of above, that possessed by the ave-
rage man in the street.
The rest of the paper is mostly taken
up with chronicles of the great pro-
gress made in the businesses of sub-
scribers, lengthy descriptions of new
brick tanneries and boot factories
being erected by manufacturers, and
encouraging reports of the flourishing
condition of the leather industries.
A wild sensation was caused in
Victoria’s House of 48 Rich Landlords,
the other day, when one of them
(Dowling) so far forgot the honored
traditions of the Chamber as to pro-
pose a surplus-wealth tax. He antici-
pated that there was quite £25,000,000
worth of “propputty” in Victoria
which might be subject to such a tax ;
£2,700,000 of which would be in land
values. A flabbergasted Council at-
tempted a debate, but had to give
up after a little and adjourn to col-
lect its intellect.
Retiring Senator Mackellar was
re-appointed to the N.S.W. Legisla-
tive Council on the last day of the
session. The Council may not do
any work for the next six months and
certainly will not for three, and an
economical Government could have saved Mac.’s
railway pass by not re-appointing him till his
services were really required to save the country.
“Rriinu”: Remembering his love and
consideration during the late war for the push
with the jug-handle nose, it is not surprising that
King Seddon has informed the M.L. House of
Reps, that he favors the abolition of the totalisator,
and hopes to introduce a Bill next session to deal
with the “evil.” With its horde of evil-faced,
loud-mouthed, hungry gang of harpies, Punter’s
Point, Wellington, should even now be a warning
of the greater evil that will assuredly follow the
tote’s suppression ; but Maoriland has a large
section of “ moral agitators ” with a roar that is
loud and insistent, and a sorrowful tendency to
roar in the interests of a rotten cause.
The disgraceful Vic- :
torian Government’s latest
proposal for repudiation re-
lates to those men in the
Victorian Railway and Pub-
lic Service who are entitled
to a pension on retirement at
the age of 60 years. Irvine’s
new Bill provides that the
Ministers may, in conse-
quence of any change, made
in any department, ret\re any
officer whether he has at-
tained the age of 60 or not,
on an annual allowance of
much less than what he is
entitled to under the existing
law. The present law re-
quires that before a per-
manent officer can be dis-
pensed with he must be
shown to have been
guilty of some miscon-
duct, or the Govern-
ment must take the
responsibility of abol-
ishing the office which
he holds. Under the
new law, when a railway
official has served the
State for 40 years, and is
within arm’s length of his
pension, he may be sacked on
the excuse that there has been a re-arrange-
ment of office-boys at the Observatory, and
on that pretence be deprived of a considerable
part of his pension. Of course, this may not be
done, but when a Government deliberately asks
for power to do a shameless act of fraud the only
possible theory is that it means to use that power.
“Teddy” Smith, who represented one-
fourth of the Argus Senate brigade, invariably
wept when the hostile crowd got to work on him.
His speech, which he read, seemed to be pre-
pared, but he was capable of one remark on his
own. When assailed by groans, laughter, etc., he
always protested : “This isn’t fair. Didn’t I pay
for the hall ? ” In the midst of his deepest sorrow
he always remembered he paid for the hall.
Be the gentle importer ! Mercury, or
Hermes, was the boss robber of his age. His
ability in “going through” Neptune for his
trident, Venus for her girdle, Mars for his
sword, &c., won him the approbation of Jupiter,
who gave him the job of “Messenger of the
Gods.” Mercury, among the ancients, was the
tutelary deity of merchants. He was also the
patron saint of thieves, swindlers, and pick-
pockets. Verb sap.
South Australia didn’t show itself dead-
tired over the Commonwealth elections only. It
has just had its municipal elections, and the
result was the same in that case ; nearly every-
body who had held a seat was sent back un-
opposed. In the city a mayor and six councillors
were wanted, and the only election was over one
councillorship; in that case the rather fantastic
J. Z. Sellar, one of the oldest Labor battlers in
the State, lost his seat.
Queensland Government has done without
any fuss what a few N.S.W. retrenchers have
tried year after year to do but without success—
practically abolished the useless position of Judge’s
tipstaff. The tipstaff, who used to bear the
emblematic rod of justice, has for years past been
little more, in most cases, than Judge’s valet; and
Queensland has concluded that it can’t afford
to pay a Judge’s valet. His Honor must pay for
his own valet or do without.
A. H. Barlow, the new Queensland Education
Minister, is putting in part of the recess attend-
ing schools, not for an hour or so while the
youngsters sing “Gorsave,” but for whole days
while ordinary work is in progress. Barlow
confesses that he went to the department with
no personal ideas on the suisjteet of education as
practised in and he finds it a han-
dicap. It’s all right as long as, after a week
or so of this, Barlow doesn’t get it into his head
that he is an educational expert.
Paris Nesbit was reproved by Chief
Justice Way during the recent Criminal Sittings
in Adelaide for appearing in court without a
junior counsel to support him. The K.C. main-
tained that the practioe had not been observed of
late, but said he would be glad to go back to it if
so desired. This means more fees for young
lawyers, and increased expense for any accused
person who wants a really first-class man to
defend him. To get,the first-class man that he
wants the accused will Also have to hire the third-
class man that he doesn’t want.
It is now pretty clear that”that cool, calm,
honest politician, Iceberg Irvine of Victoria, was
wholly insincere over the Government repurchase
of big landed estates for closer settlement.
Irvine, at Nhill, declared that the Government
had a Bill prepared for the repurchase of these
properties, and that the Bill would be introduced
this session. He has now announced the near
approach of the close of the session, and yet the
Bill has not made its appearance in any shape or
form. Plainly the beautifully honest Irvine has
proved himself in this shatter, as. well as many
others, a bigger politjca], humbug than all the
humbugs that have gone before him.
A Victorian pressman :
As soon as old King David Syme thought he had the
Irvine party, which he helped to create, broken up, he
set about getting another crowd that would bow the
knee before his throne. He did this in an artful manner.
Two or three of his minions went round the members,
saying that the King wanted to get together a moderate
party—a party in which the Labor members on the one
side and the extreme Tories, like Frank Madden and
M'Outcheon, on the other, would be left high and dry in
Opposition. The King seems to have here missed the
trend of things political in Victoria. The division of
future political parties throughout the Commonwealth is
going to be the Labor party and the Conservative party.
The so-called Liberal party will go to pot. Its advanced
members will throw in their lot with the Labor party,
and its timid, shilly-shally members will fall back into
the ranks of Toryism. Before that day comes the Labor
party will have to get a more comprehensive name.
What is wrong with the “ National party ? ”
FROM THE WOMAN’S POINT OF VIEW.
HIM : “ Well, how’s a 'preferential tariff going to
suit you? ”
HER: “I really don't know; I've never seen any-
body wearing them.”
Not a day passes now without Melbourne
Age telling the public at some length what a hope-
less failure, weakling, political fraud and incapable
is that Irvine whom it so recently boosted to the
skies. And still nobody can clearly see the
reason, for Irvine was just as glaring a fraud
when David’s paper supported him as he is
now. David still refuses to nominate Irvine’s
successor, and the country begins to wonder
whether Syme means to do without a Premier,
and run the State business at the Age office.
Vic. Railway Commissioners, on. Dec. 9th,
notified that “starving stock” rates and the
acceptance of promissory notes for stock freights-
would absolutely cease on the last day of this
year. It must be over six months since Bent pro-
fessed to abolish these rates. It is indeed marvel-
lous to learn that, when Victoria is loaded with
such a harvest that the railway department hasn’t
the least idea how to shift the grain, the rich
squatter should still be getting concessions at the
public expense on the ground that his stock are
starving for lack of grass.
The U.S. immigration officers lately,
blocked a young Maorilander who had got a billet
in a local bank and was going to it under contract..
He probably went to the U.S. by reason of
the daily papers’ stupid lie that Australia
is the only country which has immigration-
restriction laws. The U.S. opens its gates
almost as wide as Australia does to desirable
immigrants; but it bangs them harder than ever
Australia has thought of doing in the face of the
immigrant who goes there with his hands tied by.
a contract bond.
Sydney Evening News—same old lie :
East week Mr. Deakin refused to discuss the Petriana
incident at all —in any fashion or shape whatever. He
probably thought the matter would blow over and be no
more heard of, in place of, as it is, causing an outburst of
public indignation only a little inferior to that raised by
THE EXCLUSION OF THE SIX HATTERS.
And if the other party raised a fiction of its own
to counterbalance this, and talked off-handedly
about the hanging of the Evening News’s father,
that paper would probably say the other party
was no gentleman.
About the best back view of Peacock and
Co. that Vic. Assembly has had this session hap-
pened when the Opposition left the House in a
body on Thursday night over the Electoral Boun-
daries Bill. Premier Irvine asked the Oj position
to let the Bill go through committee without
debate, promising to consider any amendments at
the “report” stage. It was an extraordinary
proceeding, but the Opposition took Irvine’s word,
and then, having thus got the Bill through Com-
mittee, he refused to accept any amendments at a
later stage. By a most audacious political dodge
he diddled theoOpposition out of its chance of
moving amendments, and it retired in silent
protest without even throwing an ink-pot at the
impudent trickster.
ELECTION TIME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There is a somethin’ in the barmy air
What makes a stir around the corner pub.,
" here boozers—raving on an empty tub—
Denounce all wealth in which they ’ave no share.
An’ w’en ole Blowhard meets me goin’ to town,
And steers me gently to a private bar
To pour out polities an’ good “ three star,”
Instead o’ passin’ me with ’orty frown,
I try to ’ide the twinkle in me eye,
An’ listen ’umbly to ’is kind remarks
About the unemployed who fill the parks,
For I can smell elections drawin’ nigh.
E ain’t agin the honest working man
Like me (I ’aven’t touched a job this year) ;
It’s these ’ere Socialists we ’ave to fear—
The fools who try to alter Nature’s plan.
Gord made the rich to ease the toilers’ pain,
And give ’em shelter w’en their strength is spent
(I can’t exactly grasp the argyment—
Until ole Blowhard fills ’em up again).
But w’en ’e’s quite run down and said “ Good-bye,”
Before I’ve started on my devious way
I’m beckoned in by Hardcase, M.L.A.,
And then I’m sure election draweth nigh.
So, after all, the bush cove gets no pull,
An’ I, for one, am not a-goin’ to w’ine ;
For if the ’ayseed’s vote’s worth ten o’ mine,
’ls candidate can’t fill ’im more than full.

Melbourne, Vic., 19th. July, 1897.
Dear Sir,—l have been troubled for the past two years
with stricture, and been under skilful medical men in
South Australia and also in Victoria. I have undergone
three operations but only received temporary benefit.
As the doctors said there was no cure for me, I was
recommended, to try VITADATIO. I purchased one
bottle, which I was pleased to find acted like magic on
my complaint. I have taken five large bottles, and can
truly say up to the present time I have received great
benefit, and fully believe it will make a complete cure of
the above complaint. You are at liberty to make what
use you think of this, as VITADATIO cannot be too
highly recommended. I remain, yours truly,

A new method has taken possession of Sydney
soniety. Formally it was the mode to entertain at one s
own home. Now the thing it to do it at The Hotel
Australia.*
Old John Throssell, who was three months
Premier of Westralia, is already talking wildly
about Secession because his State hasn’t yet got
its transcontinental railway ; and a foolish bishop
named Riley has been saying something in the
same strain. The S.M. Herald chipped in with
its little contribution to the effect that old John’s
demand for Secession if his enormously expensive
line wasn’t handed down instantly from the shelf
was “an eloquent commentary on the way Mr.
Deakin and his friends have governed Australia.”
Yet, if “Mr. Deakin and his friends” had pro-
posed spending £4,000,000 —for one-third of which
N.S.W. would have been responsible—to build a
railway to Westralia, how the same fair-minded
paper would have raved !

prefer to take abroad with me, as likely to by
most generally useful, to the exclusion of all
others, I should say C/HLORODYNK. I never travel
without it, and its general applicability to the
relief of a large number of simple ailments forma
its best recommendation.”

TESTIMONIALS.
“ To the Daylesford Mineral Water Co.
“ Dear Sirs,—The machine purchased from you is per-
fection. The Stuff turned out is Splendid. It is the best
speculation I have entered into since I joined the Licensed
Victuallers.—Geo. Nicholls, Royal Hotel, Swan Hill.
Mr. P. Kennedy, Coolgardie, says :—“ Profits saved by
making my own supplies of Aerated Waters with the
Machine pay the rent op my hotel.”
Mr. Lewis, Heidelberg, Victoria, says “ I have made
thousands of dozens of the best Aerated Waters wiLh the
Machine, and it has not required sixpence worth of
repairs. No Hotelkeeper should be without one of
them.”
Mr. W. Atkinson, Hotelkeeper, Wentworth, N.S.W.,
says:—“lt is the greatest money maker yet discovered
for hotelkeepers.” • -
Mr. Burk, Yalgo, W.A., says:—“ Since getting one of
your Machines, and making our own soft stuff, I have
saved its price ten times over.”
W. 11. Jones, Peak Hill, W.A., says :—“Machine great
success.”
_E. Davis, Peak Hill, W.A., says :—“ Cannot speak too
highly of effectiveness and simplicity.”
G. N. Murdoch, Abbotts, W.A., says:—“Value of
Machine indisputable ; quality and cheapness of stuff
unquestionable.”
T. 11. Williams, Mossman, Queensland,says :—“Highly
successful, and recommend to all hotelkeepers.” „\
J. S. Davidson, Bundaberg, Queensland,says :—“Great
saving compared to previous cost of stock.”
A profitable business awaits pushing men in many small
centres of population, where a deeply-felt want exists for
a good quality of Aerated Waters. Observe the Profits.

Royalties don’t appear to be feeling well
just now. The Empress of Russia suffers from
inflammation of the ear, the Emperor of Germany
has something very wrong with one ear, likewise
hi 3 larynx ; the Queen of England is almost stone
deaf. And yet royalty protests every time an
archduchess tries to improve the blood of her
ancient family by eloping with a healthy plebeian.
In San Francisco a number of liquor shops
have been robbed in a large, violent manner of
late, and a local editor assures the public that he
doesn’t suspect the mayor of doing it :
I wish to state distinctly that I do not think it is a gang
from the City Hall that is doing all these saloon hold-ups.
There is nothing in the moral make-up of our city officers
that would prevent them going, masked and armed, into
saloons and robbing proprietors and visitors; but they
lack the nerve. They are a lot of peaceful thieves, these
office holders, and prefer to do their stealing through the
offices they hold. They haven’t time, anyway, to go
skihooting around the town at night—they are too busy
spending what they have stolen from the taxpayers
during the day.
Transvaal Leader publishes a long
article on the alleged horrible state to which
Australia has been brought by “socialistic legis-
lation,” and professes to get its facts from that
remarkable person Captain Pearse, whose cock-
and-bull yarn about the frantic rush of people
escaping from Maoriland to Argentina was
recently shown up by Agent-General Reeves. The
principal delusions which the Transvaal Leader
circulates are:
That in Australia “ seven shillings being deemed a
living wage it was enacted that no man should he paid
less /or a .day's work, WHATEVER THE NATURE OP
HIS EMPLOYMENT."
That in Australia all shops are compulsorily closed at
5 p.m.
That thousands of small shopkeepers were consequently
ruined.
That the accumulated deficit on the N.S.W. State
railways is £17,000,000 (it is really about £8,000,000).
That the N.S.W. State railways have not paid interest
“for several years.” (This is quite true, but it is also
true that they never paid interest. The “ several years ”
is an attempt to represent that the deficit is a new thing
arising out of Labor legislation.)
What liars these Tories are !

A Woman’s Power.
The smiles and favor of a beautiful woman are
heaven enough for some men. But beauty and
grace in woman are founded on good health. Good
health depends on good digestion, and that in-
variably follows the use of Mother Seigel’s Syrup,
a tonic made of fruits, roots and herbs. Beauty
and strength spring up beside it, as flowers on a
sunny slope. It brightens the eyes, clears the
skin, and gives vigor, vivacity, and health to the
languid and weak. All women need it occasionally;;
tens of thousands use it daily. “I was'greatly
troubled,” wrote Mrs. Brankier, of 48, Pacific-
street, Newcastle, N.S.W., on February 28th,
1903, “by chronic indigestion. Several doctors,
whom I consulted at different times, quite failed
to do me any good. But about twelvemonths ago
I heard of a wonderful cure of indigestion in this
city, effected by Mother Seigel’s Syrup, and
resolved to try it myself. After taking the Syrup
for a few days I felt like a different woman, less
than four bottles being sufficient to. effect my
complete cure, eradicating all traces of indigestion
from my system. I can strongly recommend
Seigel’s Syrup to all persons afflicted with indiges-
tion and stomach derangement, being convinced
by my own experience that they will find it a
speedy and reliable cure.”*

SPORTING NOTIONS.
First England-Australia Test match, progress-
ing as Tub Bulletin goes to press, commenced at Sydney
Cricket Ground on Friday. Australia won the toss, the
first occasion for eight years on Sydney Ground. Trumper
and Duff opened. Both batsmen weathered the first
oyer, Hirst’s; but Arnold’s initial delivery brought
disaster. Trumper essa3'ed to cut and edged
it into slips where Foster had a remarkable, very
low, arm’s length catch, which carried him down
on his. bent-up elbow. Hill went in. First ball of
Arnold’s second over provided a further sensation:
Duff attempted to cut a quick high-riser from the pitch
but only snicked it, and Lilley was right behind the
wicket. Then Noble went in to try and stem the rot, bub
the gloom deepened when a few minutes later 1 Clem Hill
Was trapped by Lilley trying to cut one from Hirst.
Three of Australia’s best bats had lost their, wickets
trying the cut and only 12 on the scoring board. The
great Hill was out for five. It was awful. Armstrong
joined Noble and the Australian audience leaned on its
neighbor’s shoulder and swore softly under its breath.
Even the golden-headed girls in the Ladies’ stand used
dainty little swears and looked as though they wanted to
cry. Noble and Armstrong settled down to “ play the
game.” It was painfully slow, but it was better than
the sound of falling wickets.
T-he fielding was brilliant. Two hours saw
score lifted to 83. Armstrong disappeared with 48 oppo-
site his name through an off-break from Bosanquet. He
had four 4’s in his little lot, and with Noble had brought
the score from 12 to 118. Just under 3J hours 200 runs
and Noble’s century arrived simultaneously. Then
Hirst’s full toss curled off Hopkins’ bat and he was gone for
39, after an hour and a quarter. Clouds and wind
threatened rain, and Howell went in to hit up runs, but
was caught at five and made wa3' for Gregory. Just
before stumps-draw, Bosanquet, freshly on, scattered
Gregory’s sticks with a charming off-break at 23. Score
stood at seven for 259.
Spite of heavy rain overnight, Saturday’s wicket
was little affected. Nearly 40,000 people were crammed
into the enclosures, and the last three Australian wickets
fell for 26. Laver (1.b.w.) gathered three ; Noble added
one to'his previous day’s 132, and then hooked Arnold to
short-leg, Foster held it with one hand. Noble
had made 16 fours, and stayed at the wickets on Friday
4h. 41min. Saunders was last man in, and had eclipsed
his previous best and was promising well when Kelly
succumbed at 10. Saunders had made 11. The innings
was over for 285.
It was ten minutes to 1 when Warner and
Hayward opened for England. The English captain
snicked one off Laver’s first over, and wicketkeeper Kelly
held it grimly. 1—0 —0. Tyldesles'. joined Hayward,
and in 25 minutes had made 30. Then Howell bagged
Hayward with an off-break' that fetched the middle
stump. 2 15—49. Bowling was erratic, and Tyldesley
slashed it brilliantly. After lunch run-getting slackened,
and only 15 came in 20 minutes. At 53 Tyldesley
went down to Noble. The play was excellent. The
hundred was reached in as many minutes. Then a
spell of monotonous defensive play was broken by
Laver catching Arnold at short-leg off Armstrong.
Two hours 35 minutes of play resulted in 150 only. Two
hundred showed in 3hr. lOmin! Half-an-hour before
stumps draw the crowd began to leave, thoroughly tired
of it. Finish saw Foster 73 and Braund 67, still going
strong, and the score 243 for four men out. Last pair
had added 126.

The Bulletin goes to press earlier than usual
this week, and it takes its last look at the game at a late
hour on Monday afternoon, when the Englishmen’3 score
stood at nine for 486—Foster not out 225, Rhodes not out
15. Foster’s score is a record-breaker. The highest
previous score in a test match was made by W. L. Mur-
doch in England, when that brawny Australian knocked
up 211. The record in Australia was Sid. Gregory’s 201 ;
while the highest made for England was Ranjitsinjhi’s
175. On Saturday Foster played very disappointingly
from a spectator’s standpoint. He is still playing dis-
appointingly from an Australian standpoint.

‘ ‘ Gate ” on first two days of test match reached
£2495—£1750 being taken on Saturday. Saturdays of
test matches engaged in by Maclaren’s team two years
ago were better—Saturday of first test then saw the total
takings £1934. N.S.W. Cricket Association will this
time have a deep dig into the spoils, which spells con-
siderable benefit to Cornstalk cricket generally.

“ 0.K.” : For years people have been complain-
ing that cricket, as played by experts under gate-money
conditions, often becomes needlessly tedious to all on-
lookers save the few whose appetite for “ the game ” is
insatiable. The cry was for livelier cricket—until they
got it. Warner’s introduction of the English closure rule
is now objected to, on the ground that “ it was never
intended to apply to matches of longer duration than
three days,” which is tantamount to saying that a captain
who thinks he can safely shorten the game by declaring
an inhings closed is not entitled to hasten his victory'.
With just as much reason one might protest against any
matchLterm mating before both sides have, lost twenty
wickets. If it is an objectionable thing to close a first
innings when only seven or eight wickets' are down,
why close a second innings merely because the game is
won ? Why not pound the ball.to the bitter end, and see
how many runs it is possible to win by? At Melbourne,
the other day, the Englishmen won by what was prac-
tically 12 wickets (nominally one innings) with numerous
runs to spare. Australia had never previously seen a
cricket match concluded with so little waste of time in
unnecessary batting—nevertheless the local people
grumbled. It hurt their amour propre to find the local
champions held cheaply by the visiting captain, though
the result proved that he was quite justified in venturing
to save time.
* * » *
“Hugh Stone”: In an English magazine a
writer, discussing “village cricket,” asks: “ How is it
that the village umpire always takes a bat with him to
his post ? ” But this peculiarity is not confined to English
villages. In every match I have seen in the bush the
umpire dragged a bat about after him. Down in Riverina
my fitness to stand was once questioned because I
declined to load myself with timber on a hot day. It
was the man at the other end who seemed most hurt.
He declared he had umpired for thirty years, and had
never seen an umpire officiating without a bat. I had
evidently lowered the tone of the position.

How the old players keep their places in
Australian tests. Seven of the present team played
against Maclaren’s crowd three years ago, and all but
Laver were in the last Australian team which visited
England. Every member of the team has taken part in
at least one test match. Sid Gregory has most innings
(58 for 1458 runs) to his credit while Clem Hill with 1581
runs for 37 innings has a long way the highest average.
No other present day player has accumulated 1000 runs
in test matches.

In Adelaide electorate cricket Harry Blinman
made 113 last week against the bowling of George Giffen
and others. Blinman has been playing cricket as long as
the other veteran, and was in Lord Sheffield’s year only
just left out of the test matches. Before the rise of
Darling, Jones, and Hill, “two Giffens and Blinman,
Lyons and Jarvis ” was for many years the start of every
S. A. team.

There were only 12 starters in Queensland Cup,
and but few gave St. Quentin a chance, but he got there
after a tough struggle down the straight with stable-
chum Heronry. Fitzgrafton, Jessie (last year’s winner)
and Heronry disputed favoritism at 4’s. Fitzgrafton’s
easy win of the Derby a few days previously made his
chance look unusually promising, but he only finished
eighth in the slowest Cup run for five years. Fitz.’s
bubble reputation is now quite burst. Three-year-olds
have won the race eight times and four Derby winners
(Wheatmeat, Petronel, Fernando and Balfour) have
notched the double.

A particularly angry rash appeared on the
fair face of Sydney ponydom the last two weeks. Lately-
formed Pony and Galloway Association deputationised
Kensington R/O. (principal pony meeting promoters) con-
cerning grievances. and wanted a board of appeal to deal
with disqualifications, and, considering the K.R.O.’s
attitude unsatisfactory, declared war. Forest Lodge and
Brighton courses were placed at the strikers’ service, and
it was further announced that Belmore course would
be reopened.. The new body determined to race same
day as Kensington and maintain a general bo3'cott.
Things looked blue for Kensington and Rosebery Park
and threats of disqualification were passed freely. Entries
for following Kensington meeting were particularly poor,
while the P. andG. Association totalled 104. A conference
was arranged, and strikers scored heavily. Kensington
R.O. ceased to be the autocrat of ponydom. Said now
that many, members of the victorious body are not
satisfied with concessions wrung and that there is a
chance of the new body’s swelled head ending in a burst.

This was the amazing method of procedure of
Marlborough (M.L.) Racing Club in regard to a case of
“ inconsistency.” Hinekoa (lOst. 51b.) won Blenheim
Handicap, 1J miles, beating Reikura (7st. 51b.), and others.
Later in day in six furlong Flying Handicap only two
started, Reiktfra (7st. 71b.) getting a big break on and
defeating Hinekoa (lOst. 71b.). The stewards weren’t
satisfied, but contented themselves with disqualifying
the jock for rest of meeting. Next day Hinekoa, carry-
ing the thumping weight of list. 81b., won the mile and
a distance - handicap, . Reikura didn’t start. Then
stewards held another inquiry to consider first day’s
running, but postponed decision until Hinekoa (lOst. 91b.)
met Reikura (7st. 61b.). over a shorter course later on.
Only the pair started, and Hinekoa won. Then the
stewards took both races from her, ordered tote invest-
ments on her to be returned less 10 per cent., and passed
owner and nag into oblivion for 12 months.

The very latest about the ridiculous Cplling-
wood tote fiasco is that the man who ran the alleged
wood and coal yard—Avhich was part of the tote yard,
and boasted an ornamental stack of firewood which was
never touched—has written the Iceberg Government

trespass. That weird joke of Irvine and Co. is likely
to cost Victoria something handsome before it is finally
buried.

“ Euroa’’tells the story of a cabman’s curse:
We got into his cab in Bourke-street, and when he put us
down near the Hill gates, we gave him ss. “What’s
this? ” he asked. We said it was his fare. “ Fare 1 ” he
shouted." “ Drive three of yer for five bob on Cup day ?
I want hajf a quid ! As we moved away we remarked
that we didn’t wish to buy his turn-out. “ Buy it 1 ” he
yelled after us, and his horse had a scornful look on its
face, “ I don’t suppose yer have half-a-quid among the
three of yer ; yer couldn’t buy a Frankfort. Ver blanky
bounders—may yer never have a bit of luck all day.” We
were superstitious and felt that more than anything else.
And how his curse, stuck to us ! Wakeful was beaten,
and all our other “ certs.” went under. In the Steeple,
our horse had a splendid chance of winning, but the curse
brought him down. It seemed to have spent itself by
the last race, though, and the horse we had “ emptied
out” on, romped home lengths ahead' of anything else.
We shook hands in silence. But when we went to collect,
the bookie had fled ! That broke us up completely. We
didn’t have our fare home, and it was a long walk to
town. - We tried “ lugging,” but everyone we asked had
either “ blown out ” or had his bare fare onty. We were
miser able, ami how we swore as we tramped across the
cour-se I We hung about the pubs, near the course for
awhile, in hopes of striking a friend, but it was not to
be; and we continued on our walk to town. After passing
the New’market station we came upon a crowd around a
breakdown’ in the middle of the road. The horse was
down, both shafts were broken, a wheel was gone, a
window smashed, and some of the crowd were cutting
away the harness. A man was kneeling on the horse’s
head, shouting out orders in frightful language. It was
the cabby who had driven us out 1 Somehow, after that,
the walk seemed nothing, and we reached town in good
spirits.

The falling off of it. Ex-M.L. champion nag
Advance figured in a . circus ring at Palmerston, t’other
day, as a medium for some of the company to display their
buck-jumping capabilities. That fine animal very ungal-
lantly bucked Miss Hyland and her saddle off first, but
the young lady’s brother beat the nag badly, goading
him to maddened fury, and giving the spectators a buck-
jumping display such as has rarely been witnessed. The
cruelty and the “.come down” (Advance was a great
horse) of the thing disgusts—it is on a par with allowing
nags that have won fortunes for their owners to finish up
drawing cabs or vegetable vendors’ carts. There’s little
sentiment in the make of most present day racehorse
owners.

Conclusion of Austral meet, on Melbourne
Cricket Ground, Saturday, attracted 20,000 spectators.
Final of the big thing saw S.A. champion F. H. Scheps
(160yds.) gather the winner’s portion (£450) by 30yds.,
after a brilliant sprint over the last half lap, during the
early part of which he shot out 20yds. clear as if pro-
pelled by a father-in-law’s boot. Hawker was second, and
Mayer (probably 3Qyds., further off) third. Atop of this,
and same day, Scheps annexed the Victorian Mile
by half a bike-length, and in a hair-raising finish
with Don Walker. Scheps isn’t 21 yet, and, although
riding for some time, is only in his second active season—
his initial success .was a Maiden Plate at Adelaide less
than two years ago, and then followed Eight. Hour Wheel
Race at Broken Hill. Sydney November meet last year
saw him scoop Sydney Wheel Rade (£100), and a half-
mile handicap—this after being disqualified for careless
riding in his heat of the big struggle, and subsequently
having a fine of £5 substituted for the embargo. Con-
vincing evidence that Scheps has improved remarkably
was his great battle' with Walker over the finishing 50yds.
of Saturday’s mile struggle.

‘ ‘ Mac. ” :_The ’Murkans did not reap the pro-
phesied success at Saturday’s Austral. Downing, in the
first heat of the day, lost his pedal and was counted out.
M’Farland rart third in his heat, but was badly left in the
semi-final. He annexed the International Scratch. The
big Yank, in a dressing-gown of some tea-cosy material,
looked like a stage ghost caught in the daylight as he
paddled about the arena, on show, between the heats.
Gave one the impression of some languid Goliath
being persuaded out of his tiredness to display his
prowess. Was persuaded to start in the 10 mile,
and in the last 50 yards his wheel skidded. Turned
a complete somersault, landed on his feet and
bowed to the crowd. Contrast to Lawson (who would
make a fine gladiator or tailor’s dummy). He was
putting in his run near the scoring board with a soft field
of five, and touched the winner’s machine. He turned
two or three catherine-wheels and brought the rest
down ; pointed dramatically to the winner putting in a
tame finish on his own, then pelted his bike pettishly at
his trainer, and tearing his numoer off, scratched himself
for the Austral. Reported he said the grass track did not
suit him, which was a pretty liberal condensation of his
views on the matter.

The troubles of N.S.W. League of Wheelmen
having fizzled out, the “ Council ” has decided to revise
the “ Constitution ” before the general election comes off.
The constitution badly wants amending. The rules and
regulations dealing with disqualification and the inflic-
tion of penalties require careful overhauling; also,. the
reduction of the bloated Council of 25 members is as
necessary as the other reduction of members just now
making so much printing work in the daily press.

Struggle in Melbourne last week between Syd-
ney and Victorian “fedders,” Billy Sullivan and Micko
Walsh, was sensational. Walsh forced the fighting and
punished hard, but, losing his head, he had to put up
with a deal of thumping himself. Second round was
another determined tussle, till a left swing from Sullivan
floored his vis-a-vis, whereupon referee Nerricker
declared against Sullivan—alleging he had fouled his
man. Crowd angrily and derisively hooted the decision,
and a riot seemed imminent, while beaten pug made as if
to strike the referee. Nerricker appealed to be heard in
explanation, but the house boo-hooed him lustily, and
tried to rush the stage, jeering vigorously at Walsh the
while. Then police essayed to clear the hall, without
success, till the gas was turned out. Remarkable the
number of “arguable” things Walsh has been mixed up
in. His fight with Thorn, in Westralia, was odorous ;
then followed his fouling of Silver, and one or two other
little affairs.

Hook Keys (Australia’s most promising light-
weight) qualified for a meeting with champion Bob
Turner by decisively beating Lyn Truscott at Sydney
Gaiety A.C. last week in lhr. 20min. House was a mass
of excited men from floor to rafters. Keys’ clever work
and far better general knowledge of boxing stood him in
food stead, and though not as well as he might have
een, pulled him through. Truscott stood fearful
punishment, and, always aggressive, showed a bold front
throughout. His superior poundage always gave him a
chance to the end; in the 11th round he looked a sure
winner, but Keys had too much skill and knowledge of
ring dodges generally.

Fight at Sydney National S.O. recently’tween
Blackmore and Jack Willis was short and far from sweet.
Big crowd that packed the hall expected much, but got
decidedly little. Management was quite justified in
bringing the pair together—possibilities looked pro-
mising. A big amount of money was wagered at 5 and 6
to 4on Blackmore. From the first Willis was never in it,
and didn’t seem to want to be, letting a succession of
chances go unavailed of till a left on the jaw, quickly
followed by a right on the other side and a few other
close attentions dropped him for seven seconds. Rising
badly rattled, Willis proved easy prey. A left hook sent
him boardward3 again, and another effectively com-
pleted the contract—all in one round. Willis never had
a hope, but Blackmore is no marvel—so far he has picked
his own marks.

Strongly-built and muscled Newcastle pug
Whitelaw met slimly-built, lank-limbed Ted Nelson at
National S.O. Sydney, a few evenings ago. Betting men
laid odds on the coal-city bruiser, and, in the third
round, offered 2to 1. Whitelaw hustled and roughed his
man fiercely, and seemed to have him going often, but
Nelson stood up, jabbing a clever left home, and other-
wise keeping “in it.” Though the other man’s force did
play havoc with him at times, Nelson made the enemy’s
face a picture to be remembered. Whitelaw’s wealth of
muscle hampered freedom of limb considerably, and
precluded hard hitting and quickness of action. The
tenth round saw Whitelaw stagger Nelson, and go in to
finish him, when a flukily-lanaed short-arm left jolt
under the chin spread-eagled the Newcastle man beyond
the allotted 10 seconds, and just when the victory seemed
his.

The fight between Tim Hegarty and Bob Rollo,
at Kalgoorlie, recently, didn’t draw enough to provide
the purse fought for. A tame affair ended in Hegarty
being declared winner, and those who had attended
filed out and made remarks. Later on, Rollo wrote
the Kalgoorlie Sun that Hegarty had refused to fight
unless he (Rollo) agreed to be beaten, and “ force of cir-
cumstances ” compelled him to accede.

Kalgoorlie saw another sight when Cullen
met Jessop. Gate is said to have totalled nearly £5OO.
Weights were declared within half a pound of each other,
but if they were correct appearances lie dreadfully. Still
both scaled under lOst. Cullen attacked, and Jessop hit
back straight and coolly till he reckoned the “ time had
arrived” for him to take the aggressive, and he made
things so sultry that the betting came round to his side.
Thence till the eleventh round the house was in a frenzy
of delight and excitement; then Cullen’s left arm dis-
located, and, though he tried to keep going, his seconds
very properly gave in, and ended the best fight seen in
Kalgoorlie. Jessop and Turner are now being matched
for the Australian lightweight championship.

“E. Durst”; Island boy Wickham tries to
break the 100yds. swimming record. About sft. sin. in
height, pleasant-faced, wedged-shouldered, barrel-chested,
abnormally large thighs, tapering lower legs, and plate
feet—an ideal speed swimmer. Two handicap men have
jumped off, to make it a race, and meet Swimming Asso-
ciation’s rules. Wickham stands like a runner ready to
start, all eagerness for the pistol shot; hangs a bit, then,
torpedo-like, hits the water. No stroke —just a semblance
of a mad crawl. Four limbs are striking the water indis ■
criminately, turning it into foam, and the brown body
makes lightning progress. Contrary to all ordinary rules
of speed-swimming, he rolls his body, outstretches his
fingers as he makes wild grabs at the water, fairly pulling
himself along, his head well above all the trouble, looking
for the turn. He makes it clumsily, and batters away again
A few yards off the second turn the vim goes out of his
efforts, although the feet of the limit men are splashing
on a level with his head. The strain he has put on him-
self is more pronounced as he struggles round the turn
and tiredly pushes off into the last 33yds. In the next
ten yards he gains nothing on the pace-makers. His
head hangs, his body rolls from side to side, his arms fall
limply into the water, and the splash from his kicking
feet is less. The loaf puts new life into him, he bolts
again, passes his men, and bores over in front of them.
The crowd howls for him to “ shake it up,” but he hears
nothing. A few more grabs and he hits the bar. “ How
I get on ?” he gasps. “No good, Alick.” “Me think so,
water too heavy.” And “ Dick” Cavill’s 583-ssecs. record
still stands.

Three hundred yards swimming supremacy of
N.S.W. contested at Bronte (Sydney) t’other day was
Dick Cavill’s from go—he stayed and toyed with the
opposition till completing 200yds. and then went away as
he liked winning by a dozen yards in comparatively slow
time of 3.49. Dick owns the world’s best (3.34 3-5) for the
distance, but will probably not get near that again as he
doesn’t look as well as he did last year, though there is no
one in Australasia who can beat him at any distance bar,
perhaps, the hundred. Tkeie island toy Wickham might
be found troublesome.

Unfortunate fellow suicided at Sefton.
Bowling match N.S.W.-Victoria, ended as
most people who follow that exciting and exacting
pastime anticipated—in favor of the latter. The Victorian
team was the cream of the strongest crowd of bowlers on
the continent, while that of N.S.W. was, although the
best available, generally' mediocre and unrepresentative.
First game saw N.S.W. go under—l2o to 59; but the
second, against exactly the same 16, saw N.S. W. finish
106 to 86. Then some wiseacres insisted upon a different
distribution of strength in the Cornstalk team, and
N.S.W. was beaten by 14, notching the same number of
points as did Victoria when it was beaten.

in the best of humors, when a gaunt, be-whiskered
cockey approached him, and, without a word, held out a
ticket for payment. Mick looked at the ticket for a
moment. “ What the ,” he said briefly—” that’s not
my ticket 1 ” The be-whiskered punter from Kyabram
stroked his beard silently and eyed Mick solemnly for a
full moment. “ Oh, well,” he said as he turned away,
“ it’s one o’ you Jews l’’ Mick didn’t speak. The case
was beyond language.

The death of Jack Grossland, a once famous
Lancashire express bowler who, somehow, failed to
trouble the Australians of his time, has revived a story
re the honesty or otherwise of his violent trundling.
On one occasion, when Crossland was no-balled by the
umpire for the alleged offence of lifting his elbow, he
angrily offered to demonstrate the difference between
right and wrong in professional practice. Firstly he
bowled the ball in his usual style, and it travelled a great
distance on the hop. “That’s bowling.” said Crossland.
Then he took the ball again, and hurled it fair over the
railings of the cricket ground. “That’s throwing, that
is,” he said. As a “chucker” pure and simple Crossland
had no rival. -
John Norton’s recent escapade in the
north savors strongly of an advertising joke.
Just as the boarders had sat down to breakfast in
an hotel at Mackay (Q. ), John stepped into the
dining room and commenced blazing at the
atmosphere with a revolver. Having scared
everybody away from the fried goat or whatever
it was, he retired and waited for the Mackay
bobby to do his duty. Then it transpired that
persons discharging firearms in Mackay could not
be prosecuted, as there was no municipal by-law
dealing with the subject. John seems to have
been a municipal reformer drawing attention with
a gun to the need fpr improved local government.
■Then he publicly fined himself £2O as a donation
to the local hospital, and the piebald meeting
said “hooray.”
“ Adelaide ” : Crowding into the Supreme
Court recently to see the High Court welcomed
to S.A. by the profession, I got my (I regret to
own) first sight of Barton. His mouth fascinated
me all the time Griffith was talking an address
to the Bar ; it is so exactly and unexpectedly the
non-human mouth which the caricaturists give
him. He looked straight in front of. him, and
appeared, in general, to be dead to this world—
except when he gave one absolutely wicked glance
at the photographers who were clicking and
snapping close by. But when his turn came to
speak he came to life rapidly, and spoke with
much dignity and some eloquence. By far the
finest speaker of the occasion, however, was
Attorney - General Gordon. The absence qi
Kingston was much commented on.
A very curious election item from Sydney
Telegraph
Mr. Chanter, in his Riverina canvass, is publishing
broadcast a placard challenging anyone to prove that he
voted against the suspension of the fodder duties. Mr.
Blackwood has replied to it several times, and Mr. Reid
did so most effectively last night at his Hay meeting.
The only vote taken in regard to the repeal or the sus-
pension of these duties was taken in committee while
Mr. Chanter was in the chair. It is difficult, therefore,
to see how he could have voted one way or the other.
Mr. Chanter should have delayed the publication of this
placard until nearer polling-day. He has given his oppo-
nent too much time to circumvent him.
Thus, according to the Telegraph, Chanter told
the solemn truth when he said that he didn’t vote
against the suspension of the fodder duties; there
was only one division, and Chanter, being in the
chair, couldn’t vote at all. Consequently, if
Blackwood and Reid replied “effectively” on
this point they must have departed widely from
the truth. But the Telegraph intimated quite
cheerfully that Chanter should have kept the
truth back till later, and that by telling the truth
early he gave his Freetrade opponents too much
time to “circumvent” him. Its own party’s habit
of circumventing the truth appears to strike the
D.T. rather favorably than otherwise.

Both fatman and laborman may have cause for
disappointment over the result of the Federal elections.
But every Australian may be perfectly sure there is
nothin!: disappointing in a parcel of Xmas “fixings”
from Swallow and Ariell, the famous Melbourne firm.
Generaliv known as buscuib manufacturers, S.A. are
benefactors in general. The charm of their mincemeat
is exceeded only by the witchery of their Xmas pudding,
which have practically abolished the old Hinglish fashion
of home-made pudding. Their jams and jellies are
triumphs of mind over matter. The lightness and bright-
ness of their cakes are imparted to the consumer every
time. First you Swallow and then you Ariel, in a
Shakespearian way of speaking.*
The Goldsmiths and Silversmiths Alliance, of 90
King-street, Sydney, is making one of the prettiest
displays in the city this Christmas. The well appointed
showrooms are full of beautiful novelties in the jewellery
line, and their windows, which have only recently been
refilled throughout, show to what advantage good
jewellery can be displayed. The Alliance has very
exquisite designs in rings, brooches, bangles, and pen-
dants. Its enamelled goods, which are all the present
fashion in London, are really masterpieces of artistic
workmanship. Another pretty novely is the peacock’s
feather jewellery, which has become quite a craze
amongst American ladies, whose great object in wearing
it is to upset the old fashioned superstition about this
article of adornment being unlucky. The G. and S.
Alliance is presenting to its patrons a very useful and
highly ornamental souvenir in the form of a handsome
Silver Plated Memo Tablet and Pencil, which speaks well
for the enterprise of this up-to-date firm.*
Messrs Craig, and Aitken, the celebrated Sydney
Tobacconists and Hairdressers, have moved to new
premises, 654 George-street, where business will be
carried on as before with army and navy tobacco, corn
cob tobacco (light and dark), cherry blossom (light and
dark) and other brands. So those who want a good smoke
now know where to get one. Oraig and Aitken are
agents for the plum razor, which brand shaves most of the
men in Australia to-day ; and they are sole owners of
Oapillarine, the wonderful moustache producer. They
stock all barber’s and hairdresser’s (requisites, their wig-
making is more of a speciality than ever, and any lady
who requires transformations or anything in the way of
ornamental hair will do best by sending to Craig and
Ai tken. A lady’s hairdressing room with lady attendants
is one of the most successful departments of the business.
The gentlemen’s hairdressing saloon—but every gentle-
man knows that.*

And at Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, Brisbane and Christchurch (N.Z.) _____
Sleath, M.L.A. (of N.S.W.), according to
Hansard : ~ - ..
The wife of one of the members of the Public Service
Board goes round among friends and says, “ Nobody can
get into the public service until my husband has con-
sulted me.”
After all, in spite of its wonderful lying
capacity, its astounding impudence as a faker of
figures, and its unlimited use of the “suppress,
Sydney Telegraph is not a good fighter. It has
no idea of the artistic restraint that is necessary
for successful misrepresentation. All its candi-
dates were making “splendid fights”; their
Kilarity and the respect in which they were
increased so rapidly that the supply was all
used up before polling day ; noisy bounders were
represented as having won -such golden opinions
that thousands of Protectionists “would not
vote.” And when all the universe had decided to
vote for Freetrade on Friday, what was left to be
said on Saturday ?
Of the seven 8. Australian Rep. seats only
two were fought; Glynn,
Poynton, and Holder got there unopposed. S.
Australia has had female franchise for some time,
and this probably accounts for it; for the last two
or three elections made it clear that, not knowing
much about politics, the women go strongly for
men who have made a name, and the. unknown
newcomer has little or no hope. His politics
don’t matter much. And the fact that b. A 1 }?"
tralia has practically no provincial press, while
its city papers aren’t anything of party fighters,
no doubt helps.
One of the features of the recent election
was the aspect of moral shock which the Sydney
Freetrade papers put on because Bill Lyne
applied to his supporters tO_ raise £lOOO for the
Protectionist campaign. Every party applies to
its supporters for funds, but the Telegraph spoke
of the event with bated breath, as if it were quite
a new iniquity. And if one remarks in a
sufficiently horrified tone that Bill Lyne had an
egg for breakfast, he may gradually create an im-
pression in some minds that no man has an egg
for breakfast unless he is a villain of the deepest
dye.

Extract from Goulburn (N.S.W.) paper:
We owe it to Mr. Deakin’s Government that Australia
has a law which makes it penal to save shipwrecked
foreigners and land them in the Commonwealth. The
other day the steamer Petriana went ashore on the
Victorian' coast. The helpless vessel was within a few
chains of the shore, and the crew might have been
landed in safety without loss of time. But it was
composed of Chinese and Malays, and the people who
rescued and landed them would render themselves
liable to heavy fines. The Federal Government graciously
permits shipwrecked foreigners to drown in Com on-
wealth waters, hut they may not he landed oh the
Australian shore.
As an utterly unscrupulous lie this about takes
the medal. Nobody was drowned, or even in
danger of drowning ; the whole of the foreigners
were taken off, and cared for, and sent back to
their native country. It is a pity the libel law
isn’t wide enough to enable the Deakin Govern-
ment to burst up such unscrupulous rags as this
with heavy damages. Australia will soon be
known, not only as the country with the biggest
debt per head on earth, but also a 3 the one above
all others where the daily press has most com-
pletely lost the alleged English virtues of truth,
fairness, and honesty.

A NEW BOOK o„ HEW METHODS
By F. Matthias Alexander, (who has imparted his new methods for 10 years in Australia.)
A book on asubject of vital importance and universal interest —T il£ AHT OP BEEATHIKG
—and embodying the details of A PERFECT BitE AT ill NG- METHOD (securing the
maximum of expansion and contraction with the minimum of effort) as imparted in connection with
1. THE TREATMENT OF DlSEASE— Prevention or Cure of Throat, Lung (Consumption, &c.).

2. THE CULTIVATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE HUMAN VOICE (Perfect Art in
Singing and Speaking).
3. PHYSICAL CULTURE AND BODY BUILDING (a Perfect System of Physical Development,
having a correct and natural primary movement for each exercise).
An Important Fact in connection with the treatment of the diseases enumerated under heading
No. 1: The author has treated patients recommended by Dr. Brady, Dr. W. J. Stewart McKay, Dr. Reginald
Bowman, Dr. Hogg, of Sydney ; and Dr. Kenny, Dr. Stawell, Dr. Charles Bage, and Dr. D. S. MaoColi, of Mel-
bourne ; and has received most eulogistic letters concerning his methods from Mdlle. Dolores, Dr. Charles Bage,
Professor Harrison Moore (Melbourne University), J. C. Williamson, Esq., Rev. Prior Kelly, Dr. D S. Mac Coll,
E. W. Rathbone (London art critic), Miss Mabel J. Ward (contralto vocalist), Rev. E. Handel Jones, Robert

(Barrister), Frederic Villiers, Esq., D. C. Rees, Esq. (Lands Titles Office, Melbourne). Dr. CHARLES BA-. E
writes : “ After a course of lessons from you I am fully convinced that your confidence in the correctness of your
methods is abundantly justified.” Dr. D. S. MACCOLL writes : “I am confident that your methods are excel-
lent. The bearer, Rev. ,is suffering with a throat affection. I am confident you can help him.”
Practical Value of the Book. This book will prove of great valueand practical assistance to Parents
—enabling them to impart to their children a perfect breathing method which will tend to prevent Pulmonary
Diseases, Post-Nasal (adenoid) Growths, and other defects tending to cause nasal stenosis. Dr. SEARES
SPICER, Surgeon, Throat Department, St. Mary’s Hospital, London, when advocating the study and practice of
hreathing as a preventative of adenoid growths, &c., said: “As a matter of fact, the manner of breathing of
every child, just as much as its food and clothing, housing, and air, exercise, bathing and education, required
constant and unremitting attention from the moment of birth.” A practical and valuable book for VOCAL
STUDENTS, TEACHERS, LAYMEN and EXPERTS, who desire to secure the marvellous benefits to be derived
from a perfect breathing method in all VOCAL EFFORT or in the TREATMENT OF THE DISEASES already

Nothing has happened yet in the way of
decorations for members of the Australian Parlia-
ment, but some are met with who expect that,
at an early date, the rain of ribbons and titles will
commence.
One of the closing scenes in N.S.W.
Parliament:—
Mr. Ashton : Did you notice what your Auditor-General
said on the question ? (Hear, hear.)
The Minister for Mines : 1 don’t care what a dozen
Auditors-General say.
The Auditor-General is supposed to be the final
authority on N.S.W. finance, therefore his office
should be held in respect, and Parliamentary
small boys shouldn’t run after him publicly with
clods. The present larrikin Government appointed
the present Auditor-General, and if it doesn’t
care what he says it is either the wrong kind of
Government or it has appointed the wrong kind
of Auditor-General.
Nowadays hardly anything is ever finished
in N.S.W. Assembly. If a member has a really
important suggestion to make he waits many
weeks or months for a chance to bring it forward,
and then its fate is briefly reported : ‘ ‘ The time
for private business having expired the motion
lapsed.” There is no means by which the House
can be forced to give an opinion on any matter,
nor is there any finality or satisfaction anywhere.
The proposal of Meagher, M.L.A., to establish a
sinking fund for the repayment of the public debt
was a matter of some importance, but it fizzled
out like the rest. Some method by which a mem-
ber could stop the stream of eloquence and demand
a vote on his proposal would do a lot of good.
The House would then have to make up its mind.
As a result it might gradually begin to have a
mind.

“ War E.” on bores :
Will some legislator introduce a Bill for the repression
of bores. Sunday afternoon is the only time I have to
mvself and it is invariably ruined by a bore who dis-
cuss-s the capabilities of British generals, the advantages
of superphosphate in wet seasons, the probabilities of
a Russian invasion, and whether Dill Moran or Pat Macky
is the more interesting preacher to stay away from.
I’m prepared to swear an information before a J.r. that
this man is a bore who should be suppressed. Sentence
should be six months tied to another bore.
That magnificent white sea elephant,
Auckland Admiralty House, is to claim the atten-
tion of Parliament, the local Harbor Board having
prayed the Government on its bended overdraft
to run an Act through enabling it to lease the ele-
phant as a lodging house, or something, and thus
partly save the expenditure of £5OO a year in
maintenance. The rearing of the pile was a showy
act of ghastly extravagance. It went up in a
blaze of splendor to slow music, and when the
authorities paused for applause it wasn’t forth-
coming, the Admiral of the fleet putting their
scented locks out of curl by flatly refusing to live
in the place. So the best that can be made of a
bad job is to lease it to the head dustman, or to
someone who will effectually disguise it as a three-
course meal factory, or to a Chow of royal blood
who will turn it into a steam laundry, or make it
a home for aged and incurable Harbor Boards.

Awful Eczema
Yields to “the Marvellous Blood-Purifying
Properties of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills.
The terrible disfigurement caused by this
disease is a great humiliation to both men and
women. It is purely a blood disorder, and when
the poison is eradicated from the blood the skin
will heal and become soft and white. The
experience of Mr. Spencer Pavitt, of 23 Elinders-
street, is remarkable. He had a particularly bad
case, and he tells in no doubtful language the
result after taking Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills.
He says:—
“ A few years ago whilst prospecting in
Tasmania, round Beaconsfield, Lefroy (which was
my home), I contracted that awful malady Eczema.
I suffered severely and had to give up work. I
consulted doctor after doctor, and was a patient
in the Launceston Hospital, but no good seemed
to come from either. I was in a bad state, my
body all over sores. Seeing an advertisement of
Indian Root Pills I determined to give them a
trial. I bought them from a Beaconsfield chemist.
I at once felt a relief, and now for months, I am
happy to say (except a few scars) there was not
a sign of Eczema on me (anyone who has suffered
knows only too well this awful name), and I am
now completely cured. I am-only too happy to
be able to bear testimony to the marvellous blood-
purifying properties of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills. I never go anywhere without recommending
them, and have in my own experience fobnd them
to be wonderful in the cure of liver diseases and
constipation. I shall be only too glad if this
small testimony of true relief I have derived from
Indian Root Pills will be the means of inducing
other people to try them. You can use this as
you like, and I shall further be very glad to give
personal testimony as to my cure.”
Such testimony as this should satisfy the most
sceptical as to the splendid properties for purifying
the blood contained in Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills. They are a perfect blood purifier. They
cleanse the stomach and cure all diseases arising
therefrom, and keep the liver and kidneys in
proper working order, and are a positive cure for
biliousness, constipation, indigestion, sick head-
ache, piles, pimples, boils, and for female ailments.

HAVE YOU
ABADLEG
with Wounds that Discharge or otherwise, perhaps sur-
rounded with inflammation and swollen that when you
pre.s your finger on the inflamed part it leaves the impres-
sion ? If so, under the skin you have poison that defies al.
the remedies you have tried, which, if not extracted, yon
never can recover, but go on Buffering till death releases
you. l’erhaps your knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated ; the same with the ankles, round which the skin

Coolgardie (W. A.) has been exciting itself over
a new find made by the Hampton Syndicate near the old
“ Billycan Rush,” three miles east of Coolgardie, where
some Italian woodcutters secured about 7000oz. of gold
four years or so ago. The syndicate was formed on
Oct. 3, and consists of 260 shares, of which 60 are paid.
Calls of Is. a week were made, and, after six calls, or £60
in all had been paid, a rich strike was made at a depth of
16ft. In a very short time 400oz. of gold was dollied, and
the members of the syndicate received a div. of £5 a
share. The find is supposed to be the cap of a lode, but
until further prospecting is done, no one can say if there
is any permanency in it. Judging from Coolgardie’s
previous rich finds, it is probably a mere surface blow.
* * * *
Golden Link’s (Kalgoorlie, W.A.) Eclipse lease
continues to open up well in the oxidised zone, and it is
estimated that above the 100ft. level there is enough ore
in sight to keep the 20 stamps going for two years.
This is a pretty big contract, as the mill is treating 5000
tons a month, or about double the output of any other
20-head mill. Very large profits have been and are being
earned.'and the co. is now in a position to declare a sub-
stantial div. The Golden Link lease, adjoining the L.V.
Consols, is looking much better in the deeper levels, and
may soon be adding to the output. In this co. 353,183
shares have been, issued, and there is a liability of 2s. a
share. This liability will probably be wiped off out of
profits, as Bull is not fond of mining scrip which has an
assessment in view
* * * »
Kalgoorlie Amalgamated (W.A.), which prac-
tically surrounds the Eclipse, has been publishing assays
from £-oz. to 2oz. per ton from ore taken from the 90 and
170ft. levels. So far nothing of any permanent value has
been established, but, judging from the position of the
property the co. should have a future if well managed.
• » * . *
Hannan’s Reward, Mt. Charlotte (W.A.), is now
in charge of J. L'. Sinclair. The mine is of little value, and
Sinclair has a tough row to hoe ; but the property is so
intersected by rich leaders that fossickers are tumbling
over each other to obtain a tribute. Before long the co.
will probably turn out 200 to 300oz. a month, but there is
practically no hope of dividends.
* J ‘ - * * *
Lancefield, Laverton (W. A.), which was sampled
some mo.nths ago by Bewick,' Moreing and Co., is now
practically owned by that firm, which has bought up the
bulk of the shares. At the time of the examination
B.M. and Co. said that the ore was too low grade for the
price, and threw up the option. The lode is very wide,
averaging 18ft. at the No. 1 level, and increasing to 26ft.
at No. 3. This width of ore has been driven on for a
length of about 1000ft., and has been producing about
700oz. of gold a month from ore averaging about 8dwt.
Cer ton. The co. has, for the past three or four years,
een paying monthly divs. of 4d. per share, or £360 on its
21,600 shares, and a drop in the average of ldwt. per ton
would have knocked thingg endways. If equipped with
100 head,of up-to-date stampers, treating 12,000 tons a
month, the proposition might become a valuable pro-
perty. As B.M. and Co. do things on a big scale it is
quite on'the cards that the mine may yet rank as a fairly
large producer
* • • •
Queensland Menzies (W.A.) is again suffering
from the rotten policy of never looking an inch ahead.
The sixth, or 446ft. level, is nearing completion, while
the seventh, or 534ft., has only recently been started.
At this depth the eastern lode is 140ft. from the shaft
and the western 210ft. The crosscut is being driven at
the rate of about 40ft. a month, so that it will be three
months or so before the eastern lode is reached, and
nearly five before the western is encountered. There-
after, some opening-up will have to be done before really
rich returns can be looked for, and regular dividends
resumed. Tho co. is still producing about 750oz. a
month,,so it is very unlikely that it will have to undergo
reconstruction, but .it is very unsatisfactory for share-
holders that divs. should have to be suspended, even
though only temporarily.
'* * *
North-Western Associated, Kalgoorlie (W.A.),
has just-been given a corpse-reviver. The co. was floated
in 1896 with 375,000 shares, and £50,000 working capital,
which has all disappeared with surprisingly little to show
for it. -Out of the original 15 leases, containing 294
acres, only two, the Boomerang and Womera, of 42 acres,
remain. The assessment of Is. 6d. a share will produce
£28,125, which should give directors another long lease
of life. The leases are situated on the north-east belt, of
the Golden Mile, and have good possibilities, as that part
of the district has hitherto been very badly prospected.
For a long time past the ground has been held by tribu-
tes whb have taken out several hundred tons of loz. ore,
and made a real good thing out of it.
* * * *
Kalgurli (W.A.) is opening up very well at the
1000ft., or 10th level. In driving north, about 300ft. from
the main shaft, ore averaging 2oz. per ton has been met.
The mine all over is looking better, and next year’s divs.
may show a marked advance on the current year’s.
At Poverty Point.
An item ot interest in one of the Melbourne monu-
mental yards at present is Dick Stewart’s gravestone.
When completed it will divide honors with the Spring-
thorpe Marble at Booroondara. The pedestal—a mound
of stones and a tall cross roughly hewn out of grey
granite—throws into relief a life-size figure of an angel
with flowing robes and a pathetic little mouth, looking
up beseechingly. It is none other than our own Nell—a
very striking likeness —in white marble. It is said the
figure was executed in Italy from a photo.
Beau Nash, who is introduced in “Monsieur Beau-
caire,” played some curious pranks for wagers before he
settled down as master of ceremonies at Bath. He once
imitated Lady Godiva by riding naked through a village
—but on a cow instead of a horse. On another occasion
he the main entrance of York Minster, clothed
only in a blanket and a carefully-studied expression, as
the people came out of church. At Bath, Nash lived by
gambling and by making a levy on the gaming-tables.
‘ ‘ Petramos ”: Who said that theatrical poster work
was being revolutionised? Bill Anderson, by the time
this sees print, will probably have coined money in Ade-
laide with “In the Shadow of Night,” the posters of
which are about Hhe ..wildest things that have shocked
suburban boardings Ifor years. The boss poster resembles
a glare and a surrounding gloom. A red devil appears
to be simmering over a brimstone fire, and a white angel
(feminine) is floating towards him. Whether her clothes
are insured, or whether she gets impaled on the devil’s
horns I don’t know.
“ L.W.” : The result of the Slapoffski-Musgrove trial
will'possibly be an improvement in the manners of
theatrical managers. The manners of many theatrical
managers want improving. In all human probability
had Mr. Musgrove explained politely to Papa Slap, that
he, Musgrove, did not think Papa’s daughter a suitable
lady for the 00., there would have been no trouble, and
Mr. Musgrove would have been spared the unpleasantness
of being held up to the world as a gentleman who
doesn’t know how to talk like one.
Nellie Stewart’s value was talked of during the Mus-
grove-Slap. suit. Nellie wouldn’t put herself down for
less than £BO a week ; anywhere else, she reckoned
she would be worth £2OO, but she knew she
wouldn’t get it in Australia. Vincent, J. 0. Williamson’s
manager, though he didn’t want to say, confessed at last
that he woulsj offer £lOO, and spring to £l5O if he
couldn’t get her for less, but wouldn’t take her at £2OO,
though she was worth it.
A poetic gleam from the Slapoffski-Musgrove squabble.
G.M., from England, offered Slap, an engagement for
pantomine and comic opera till a grand opera season
came round again. If he accepted the offer he was to
cable “ Bunions,” and if he refused “ Boils.” “ Were you
glad of the offer ?” “It is difficult to say.” “ What did
you cable ? ” “ Bunions.”
“ E.” : Teddy Lauri, in the Slapoffski-Musgrove case,
referred to himself as the “ greatest dancer in the
Southern hemisphere.” He was right. Lauri is the best
Australia has seen since the old Gaiety days. He is a
master of all styles, is marvellous in “ deportment,” and
has the technique of the old Italian school. He dances
with his whole body, and not only with his legs. Fred
Storey in “ romantic grotesque,” Johnnie Coleman in the
“ Scarecrow,” Hugh Ward in “ modern eccentric,” and
Barney Fagan in a “ shuffle,” had all interesting move-
ments ; but Lauri, outside of his acrobatic evolutions, is
a virtuoso who insists on such elements as beauty, grace,
and lightness. His expressive power, by means of
gesture, movement and rhythm—the art of the old
pantomimists—is something that has rarely been seen
here before ; and he has shown that the Dance, in its
highest form, consists of the “beautiful in movement,”
and not merely in a meaningless flutter of skirts, or in
laborious leg gymnastics.
What is happening to the old style of musician—he of
the long hair, loose collar, and entranced gaze? Most of
the musical witnesses in the Slapoffski case looked just
like wharf-labor professors or pick and shovel artists—
though Slap, himself wanted but the flowing collar to sit
for Beethoven or one of the old Dutch masters.
The Willoughby-Geach co. purposes a new farcical
comedy—•“ The Boy From Buffalo”—at Auckland, on
Boxing Night. It is described as a fat, full-blooded
farce, big enough to fill the bill without the assistance of
a curtain-raiser, and almost worthy'to be called ‘ ‘ another
‘ Jones.’ ” Willoughby, of the gladsome socks and spirit-
ful waistcoat, is ever looking forward to the time when
Geach, having totted up the week’s receipts, will cry
“Another ‘Jones’!” in a voice broken by emotion.
Their joint dream of dramatic achievement goes no
further than that for the present. At some future period
they may possibly drop into sentiment, and speculate in
a beautiful revival of “ East Lynne.”
If Madame Slapoffski, as the “Fortune Teller,” was
worth more than £35 a week to an Australian manager,
how much would Etnilie Melville, at her best, have been
worth in the same character? What are the relative
values of such various qualifications as vocal ability,
acting ability, dancing, personal beauty, and “ indefinable
charm of manner” as regards a lady who undertakes an
all-important part in comic opera? ,
A correspondent writes :
The shunting of Frank Farnell, M.L.A., into a paid
Government billet is.only another proof that N.S.W.
Parliament has outlived its ideals. The shunting of
Varney Parkes was of the same class, though with a little
of the veneer of democracy upon it. A compact made
publicly in Parliament between Parkes and Jennings,
when the latter was Premier, and a bucolic member was
mentioned for a police magistracy, was that until a
member was six months out of his seat he should be in-
eligible for a State appointment. That compact was
accepted by the House as a fair, square, decent arrange-
ment.' Now the Government appoints a man while in his
seat, and times his entry on his new duties so that he shall
draw his Parliamentary pay until the day the new pay
begins.
The other day seven sailors were picked
up at sea in an open boat, and brought to Mel-
bourne by the Cromarty. Immediately they
landed they were lodged in gaol, though nothing
was known against them, and they were mostly
white, and spoke French. It was not for five
weeks that they were proved to be criminals, and
even then the crime alleged against two of them
was the mere trifle of having- helped to steal the
boat they were found in. But all seven were
shipped back to New Caledonia, and the blessed
Argus, which for five weeks had known nothing
derogatory to them, said never a word. But they
were mostly white; also they were gaoled under a
State law; the Federal Government had nothing
to do with them. Else we should have had
another Shipwrecked Sailor Lie.
Extract from the cries of Mr. “Jack”
Want:
England had not one of these blood-sucking Common-
wealth Governments which wrung £9,000,000 a year out
of the pockets of the Australian people.
England has got a Government which wrings a
lot more taxes out of each inhabitant yearly than
the Australian has to pay, but no one could
expect Mr. “Jack” Want to know that. Nor
could any one expect that Mr. “Jack” Want,
because he didn’t know anything, would abstain
from saying a lot of things. “ Jack ? s ’’speeches
are mostly filled with the things he doesn’t know.


A GREAT TESTIMONY
A
V
Mr. ARTHUR HILL (of Hill and Sylvainy).
Men are Livingin Australia
whose lives are failures, who are dying by inches. Illness has brought
them adversity, ill-health has destroyed their energy. They become
hopeless and ambitionless, finding life devoid of the joys that make
it worth the living.
Disease means an ENEMY. It may mean Death. A man
likes to feel strong, with no limit to his physical and domestic
pleasures. He likes to feel
Every Inch a Strong, Vigorous Man,
to feel in the flood of glorious youthful health. If he really wants
to be healthy, cured of any complaint from any cause arising, he
should consult the SPECIALISTS of
The Freeman & Wallace Institute
who practise in the front rank of Science, and whose keen
insight into diseases, and whose singular skill in CURING
THEM have made their names famous over Australia. Their
ELECTRO-THERAPEUTIC methods have been endorsed by
some of the leading persons of the land. In all instances where
this treatment has been adopted, speedy and
Remarkably Curative Effects have Resulted,
the patients enjoying better health than they have experienced
for years.
Here is the testimony of a splendid athlete, the finest art-cyclist
who has visited Australia, now starring the States under contract to
Mr. Harry Rickards, the great Vaudeville King. MR. ARTHUR
HILL, of “ Hill and Sylvainy,” whose portrait is here published,
recently injured his back, which affected the kidneys seriously.
Here is his testimony, to the SPECIALISTS’ ONE POUND
ELECTRIC “ INVIGORATOR ” BELT and to their Magical
Electro-Medical treatment.
“During April of this year I strained the
muscles of my back, which threatened complete
prostration. To regain my nerve and muscular
strength speedily, I wore one of your much spoken
of Electric “ IN VIGORATOR ” BELTS, and adopted
your treatment. It is a wonderfully curative in-
strument, for in a few days I regained that mus-
cular power essential to the great feats of strength
involved in my professional career.
(Signed)

Any man who may be ill or weak from any cause may regain his lost strength
in a few weeks by adopting THE SPECIALISTS’ wonderful modes of nerve
re-invigoration. Their Electric “IN VIGORATOR ” Belts are constructed
upon the finest scientific plans. They are locally manufactured, and locally
certificated.
They are Sold for One Pound Only,
and can be worn by any member of a family. £8 is allowed in return for their £lO
Electric “ IN YIGORATOR ” Belt, which contains 2oz. 18ct. gold, even after a cure
has been effected. Duty on all Belts is paid throughout the States. There is no
Functional, Nerve, Stomach, or Kidney Disease which this treatment will not
alleviate and cure.
All these “ INYIGORATOR ” Belts bear the highest awards from the highest
electrical authorities in Sydney, and from Mr. Albert Libby, Consulting Engineer for
Allis, Chalmers, Co., the largest electrical firm in the world, and who supervised the
formation of the present electric car service of Sydney. These certificates may be
inspected upon application.
THE SPECIALISTS have testimonies, in addition to Mr. Hill’s, from such men
as Mr. DANIEL O’CONNOR, M.P., Mr. PATRICK LARKIN, J.P., Inspector
FOWLER, N.S. Wales Police, and numerous others. These are but a few instances.
They have cured numberless men from such grave diseases as DYSPEPSIA, INDI-
GESTION, GOUT, NEURALGIA, SCIATICA, BLOOD COMPLAINTS,
BLADDER and '
Liver Troubles, Prostratic Disorders, Varicocele, etc.
They have indisputable proof to this effect. Their Electric “ INVIGORATOR”
Belt, when worn round the waist nightly for a few hours, saturates the vital nerve
centres with a healthy natural energy. LACK OF NERVE FORCE is at the root
of the above diseases. Electricity restores nerve-power, and the current, assisted by
strong reconstructive remedies, soon effects a radical cure. Electricity creates the
necessary tissue essential to perfect health, and when time and money is spent upon
such a form of treatment the chances of a radical cure are rendered certain.
The Specialists’ Fees are: Advice and Medicine, £1 only.
When under treatment you are under the care of an Internationally Registered
Physician and Specialist, Dr. R. WALLACE, M.D., L.R.C.P., E., L.F.P.S., E., L.M., who is

The Volcanic Aerated Water Machine is being used by MESSRS. SPIERS & POND

appreciated. Weight, 801bs. Copper, thoroughly tinned inside and outside.
3. The gas tube holds 571bs. pure gas, being much larger than the tubes supplied with other plants.
4. The Turn-over Bottling Rack is made of the best metal. Thirty dozen per hour can be bottled with it.
5. The “ VOLCANIC ” Machine is the only one of its kind erected in the leading houses in Melbourne, including—
The Grand Hotel, Parer’s Crystal Cate, Parer’s The Duke Cate, Young and Jackson’s, J. Richardson’s Hotel,

BENGER’S FOOD is
not only highly nutritive,
but is most easily digested
and is so delicious that it
is enjoyed by Infants, In-
valids, Convalescents and
the aged.
«
The London Medical Record
savs It is.retained when all

The British Medical Journal
says “ Benger’s Food has by
its excellence established a
reputation of its own."

A feeling of disgust is sinking into Vic-
torians in regard to the new management of the
railways. This feeling was strongly marked in
the Leg. Assembly on the question of the carriage
of grain. Of course the awful Kyabrammers of
Victoria, who are constantly on the look-out to rob
the State, are sore at the determination of the new
Railway Commissioners to charge a fair rate for
the carriage of the coining season’s wheat. But,
apart from this, the public is slowly awaking to
the fact that the Iceberg Government, with its
bullying Bent, has so disorganised the whole rail-
way service that it is impossible to get any good
work out of it. _ Also the notion is gaining ground
that the expensive Tait, who was imported from
Canada on the recommendation of a relative of an
Irvine supporter in the Assembly, is more of a
society pretty-man than a genuine railway mana-
ger. lnere can be no doubt whatever that the
Commissioners have utterly failed to appreciate
the importance of the suburban traffic They
have allowed a large share of it to fall into the
hands of the trams It was the suburban traffic
which paid best before the advent of the Canadian,
and which really carried on its back many non-
paying country lines.

The man who can make a good phrase is
greater than he who taketh a city. President
Roosevelt makes a good beginning, with his pro-
posal to break into Colombia under “ Civilisa-
tion’s right of eminent demesne." The making of
the Panama Canal is a work of sufficient urgency
to justify considerable straining of abstract justice
when a place like Colombia gets in the way, but
why not burgle without the beautiful language?
A burglar with a text tied to his crowbar isn’t an
edifying sight.
“Burglar Bill" : Saw a confirmed opium-
eater come into gaol once to do six months. Too
much of a rebel to go near “ the poisoner ” to get
a stimulant to hold him together, he battled with
the torture on his own. Started him with me
constructing trousers, but when he had sewn 14
buttons round the feet of a pair of trousers, I put
him on at buttonhole-making. He cut the holes
four inches long, and worked like a Bawler
sewing-machine, going full speed, with a jerky
motion. Told me he never slept a moment for
the first ten nights. Then he straightened up,
and ran on all right to within a month of his dis-
charge, when all the old craving came back on
him. Day before he went out he had the same
symptoms as when he came in. I made him knock
off work; it was a lot of trouble to me cutting the
buttons off those trouser-legs.

A COMPLETE CUBE.
Mr. W. O. Hearne.—Dear Sir,—l am writing to tell you
about the wonderful cure your medicine has effected in
iny case. About three years ago I began to cough. At
first the cough was not severe, but it gradually got worse,
and I became very weak and troubled with nitfht sweats,
pain in my chest, and great quantities of phlegm. On
several occasions there was blood in the expectorated
matter. I had been treated by a doctor, who pronounced
my case to be Consumption, and various other treatments
had been tried, but without benefit. It was at this stage
that I heard of your Bronchitis Cure, and sent to you for
a course of the medicine. When it arrived I was too ill to
eave my bed, but I commenced taking it at once, and
gradually improved. lam glad to say that the two lots
of medicine you sent have effected a complete oure, for
u hich accept my very best thanks.—Yours gratefully,
J. BLAIR

Mr. W. G. Hearns, Geelong.—
Dear Sir, —
Your letter and Bronchitis Cure to hand quite safe.
I am sure you will be glad to know that your Bronchitis
Cure has quite cured me. I was very glad when it came,
as I was suffering from a severe attack of Bronchitis at the
time it arrived. I had sent for my own doctor, but had
not had one night’s rest for a week. I started taking the
Bronchitis Cure three times a day as directed, and was
very much eased at once. At the end of a week I only
took it twice a day, and then only every night for a
week, as I was so much better when, thanks to the Lord
for adding His blessing, l was quite well, and walked into
town and back without feeling any fatigue. I had not
done that previously for 12 months—always went in the
omnibus—as walking caused me such pain and rlistri ss in
the chest. I always walk now, and never feel it, and I
am stronger than I have been for years. I thank my son
for his great kindness in sending the medicine, and am,
dear Sir,
“Yours very truly,
“M. MORTIMER.

her DAUGHTER HAD BEEN VERY ILL.
SPITTING UP BLOOD.
THE DOCTOR SAID NOTHING MORE COULD BE
DONE.
CURED BY HEARNE'S BRONCHITIS CURE.
The extract runs as follows :—“ As for myself, thank
the Lord, lam feeling stronger than I have for years. I
had an attack of Bronchitis in November, but Hearne s
Bronchitis Cure was again successful. I feel quite well,
and walk into town feeling quite strong.
“ I must ask you to send me six bottles more of the
medicine, as I wish to have a supply in the house. I
have tried to get it made up here, and let my chemist
have a bottle to see what he could do. He tells me this
week he can make nothing out of it, he never saw any-
thing like it before, so there is only one thing for me to
do—send for more. I have never kept in bed one day
since 1 commenced to take it. I used to be in bed a fort-
night at a time always, and after that for months I was
as weak as I could possibly be, and was always taking
cod liver oil, so you will see at once it is quite worth
while sending for it such a long distance.
“ Something more I must tell you. Charlotte has been
very ill since I wrote you. ller cough was so bad she
never had a night's rest, and was spitting up blood
very much. The doctor told her husband that there was
nothing more he could do for her. So on the Sunday I
sent her half a bottle of the Bronchitis Cure, and told
her to try it, and if she did not use it, not to waste it,
but send it back again. She had such confidence in her
doctor that I thought she would not try it. On the
Wednesday I sent over again, and she was much better,
the night’s rest was very good, and cough and bleeding
from the lunys better. She sent for another half-bottle,
and on the following Sunday sent over to say that she
was quite cured and did net require any more medicine.
So you see what great good it has done, and she wishes
to have some of my next supply.”

A Seven Tears’ Case.
EXPECTORATING BLOOD AND MATTER.
COMPLETELY CURED,
“ Mr. W. G. Hearne. , .. .....
“Dear Sir —Your medicine has cured me of bronomtis
and asthma, from which I suffered for upwards of seven
years, during which period I was scarcely ever free from
coughs, and frequently the difficulty of breathing was so
distressing that for nights in succession I had to si'up.
I write you this acknowledgment from a sense of duty, as
in my ease every other treatment had failed. For a yea
previous I had been getting very much worse, and at the
time I obtained your medicine I was confined to bea
suffering from a most violent cough, expectorating blooa
and matter, and apparently beyond hope of recovery.
The first dose of the medicine gave me weicome reher,
and I steadily improved as I continued the treatment,
until I became, as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely,
H. WALKER, Balmain, Sydney.

medicine I quite got rid of the Asthma, and sin »
which was in the beginning of 1883- 15 years ago I ha
not had the slightest return of it. The medicine quit
cured me, and I have much pleasure in recommending it.

An Eventful Day at Yam.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The boy behind the old stable was very lonely.
Naturally a youth of abounding vivacity, he was
yet capable of profound sadness, and this after-
noon he sat in his solitude, playing a listless game
of solo “knucks,” and indulging himself in a fit
of gentle melancholy. The day was fair; the
wide flat lay spread before him, flooded with
warm, golden sunlight, filtered through a film ol
smoke; the cavernous bluestone quarries yawned
invitingly ; the thick bush beyond was rich with
the fullness of summer. He could hear the queru-
lous chummering of a million parrots. He knew
that they hung head-down among the white-gum
blossoms, clustering like briar berries, and he had
in his pocket a “ging” with a shop-made wire
prong, a “ ging ” of marvellous power and deadly
accuracy. Yet he dared not, for the life of him,
venture from his cover.
Kid Carter was “ wagging it.” At dinner-time
he had secreted himself within the fence sur-
rounding Plover’s old butcher’s shop, the sole
remaining building in what had once been the
township’s second-best street, thinking the ex-
ploration of the big, empty house and its out-
houses would be sufficient for an afternoon’s
amusement. It was now only about half-past
two. The attractions of the dark, dusty rooms
were exhausted; the last “spoggy’s” egg was
pillaged from the chimneys ; and all the rubbish
in the outhouses carefully prospected.
Kid Carter had knocked boards from the back
of the stable, and crept through into the open,
but only to find his weariness deepen to a pro-
found ennui, touched with sadness. The glowing
world was all before him, but he knew that the
wide flat was right under all the prying eyes of
the township, and an attempt to escape in that
direction would mean immediate detection, and
would surely send Mother White, or Mother Lee,
or Mother Hogan, or perhaps all three, trotting
breathlessly to Mrs. Carter’s kitchen-door with a
joyful betrayal.
Kid mused on the .mpious vindictiveness with
which he was beset by the mothers of the town-
ship. It was abominable, inhuman ; he was only
a poor boy trying to do his best in a perverse
world, and everybody was down on him. When
he rushed into a flaming house, as he intended
doing one of these times, and rescued little
golden-haired Flo Stevens from an awful doom,
sustaining shocking injuries in the act, but
bearing them with a sweet and smiling fortitude,
these people would understand him better, and
would know how cruelly they had misjudged him.
But at that moment Morrissey’s dog Botts
came sniffing round the other corner, and the
dream was dispelled. The imp and the hunter
awoke in Kid, and a stone from his “ging” sent
the dog howling. Botts returned a minute later,
and started a distant, desultory barking at the
boy, like a dog who takes little interest in the
business, but can find nothing better to do. This
threatened discovery, and conciliatory measures
were progressing favorably, when suddenly Botts’
attention was diverted by somebody still out of
the range of Kid’s vision, and the boy scram-
bled into the stable again to await developments.
It was Mrs. Tim Gleeson who came into view,
and Mrs, Tim’s apron betrayed the outlines of a
hidden billy. Mrs. Gleeson’s appetite for beer
was notorious, and her sprees were the township’s
most popular sensations; yet the lady had an
extraordinary diffidence about her comings and
goings between her house and The Drover’s Arms,
and was strangely shy of being seen in possession
i of a quart billy. She had still an ingenuous belief
that the township regarded her as a person whose
sobriety was a standing reproach to her neighbors.
Mrs. Tim Gleeson was a short, stout woman.
Her face was mottled, and in figure she resembled
three balls of dough placed one on top of the
other, and then slightly depressed. Botts was
barking at her heels, and making mischievous
snaps at her short skirts. Under cover of the
building she turned upon him fiercely. He was
an amiable dog, but his intentions were likely to
bring her into public contempt.
‘Gerrout, ye idjit baste,” she cried, “would ye
ruin me ? Would ye bring shame on a dacent,
sober, God-fearin’ woman?”
She hurled stones at the tyke, and then,
assuming the modest deportment that character-
ised all her pub trips, she passed on. Botts
skulked after her, a little disconcerted, but still
with the air of a dog with a duty to perform.
“His-s-s!” said Kid encouragingly from the
stable.
Botts needed nothing more. Giving a joyous
yap he bounded after Mrs. Tim Gleeson, and
barked noisily at her heels, and frisked about her
in an exuberant larrikin spirit all the way to
Paddy Hannan’s. Mrs. Gleeson walked de-
murely, ignoring the dog’s attentions, but conscious
that the eyes of half the women of the township
were upon her, and that those women hated her
for her rigid sobriety and her orderly conduct.
Mrs. Gleeson entered by the store door. Never
in her drunkest moments had she been known to
use the bar door. In fact, the drunker Kitty
became, the more anxious she grew to preserve
her reputation, and even though she walked like
a lame beetle on wet paint, and her hair streamed
in the wind, and her bonnet hung down her back
on one strand, her skill in masking the incrimina-
ting billy never forsook her. While the billy was
out of evidence she felt safe from the tongue of
scandal and the finger of scorn. Shingles ex-
plained everything else. Shingles was Mrs Tim’s
pet complaint.
Botts waited for the lady to issue forth, and
renewed the attack, dashing at her from all sides,
and barking in an excess of canine devilment.
Kitty made a detour of the old shop in order to
mask her movements as much as possible from the
inquisitive women of Yam ; a sure proof that her
spree was well advanced. Screened by the
deserted house, she reproached Botts again with
great bitterness, and much language that must go
unrecorded.
“ Hell to yer sowl for a low-lived mis-begotten
mongrool cur! ” she wailed, with a touch of
emotion so profound that Kid writhed giggling
among the litter. “Fer whoi do ye plague a
poor body wid her on’y boy a-lyin’ in the grass,
an’ the shingles that bad she don’ know the joy
av loif one moment from another?” Botts was
visibly disconcerted by the rebuke, and barked
foolishly to keep himself in countenance. “Divel
blast ye ! ” yelled Mrs. Tim, with a sudden
change of mood, “take that!” The first stone
missed, but she ran wildly at another, and suc-
ceeded at length, sending Botts limping and yelp-
ing dolorously. Mrs. Gleeson picked up her billy
again, composed herself into her attitude of proud
humility, and went on.
“ Hiss-s ! Soolem ! ” whispered Kid Carter,
and Botts forgot his troubles, and was off again,
harassing Mis. Gleeson’s retreat. The dog
returned in a few minutes, wriggling his body,
whisking his tail, and grinning with all a mongrel’s
impish fatuity. His manner plainly implied an
understanding between himself and Kid, a part-
nership in villainy. Kid applauded him, and
encouraged his advances, inveigling Botts into the
stable. The boy knew that Mrs. Gleeson would
be passing often. It was one of the lady’s idio-
syncrasies to buy a small quantity of beer at a
time, under a foolish illusion that she needed only
just one wee drop to relieve the worst symptoms
of her shingles. This habit had earned her the
name of “ Threepenn’orth More.”
Mrs. Gleeson came again, and again. Botts
was encouraged to invite public attention to the
passing of the lady with his clamor and insane
oaperings. The third time “Threepenn’orth More”
went by with caution, looking anxiously to the
right and left, but there was nolfoe in sight, for
Kid had replaced the boards of the stable w., 11,
and Botts was gagged within. A few seconds
later the brute was after her, and Mrs. Tim’s soul
was ablaze with wrath as he tugged her skirts and
tumbled under her feet, yapping the while like
something frantic. The bobbing of female heads
behind fences and at windows and doors, and an
occasional dry cackle of laughter induced her to
carry her nose high and take special precautions
with the billy. She felt that behind the sleepy,
lazy quiet of the blinds and the buildings, the
women of Yam were wide awake, and eager for
an exposure. And she was right. The township
was watching developments.

She went on, and this time her manner betrayed
agitation. She bought her beer, and was return-

street in the eye of the township, when ° , 8
made a snap, and secured the apron ; then, back-
mg valiantly, he towed Airs. Gleeson hither and
thither and up from behind the fences rose, the
heads of the women of Yam, and they stared with
all their eyes.
Suddenly, rip went the apron, and Botts fled
with his trophy, leaving the fateful billy ex-
posed to Kitty’s critics. But Mrs. Tim was not
beaten yet; like a flash, she dumped the utensil
on the ground, and, planted between it and the
enemy, endeavored to hide the evidence of her
guilt with her skirts. Her arms were folded on
her breast; her nose was high in the air. Stand-
ing thus, she defied the whole township.
Botts returned immediately, and, circling round
the tragic figure, he harked noisily. The dog had
been trained to carry Morrissey s billy, and, some
unfortunate instinct possessing him, he nipped up
Mrs. Gleeson’s quart pot and dashed off with it.
Tliis was too much. Kitty’s dignity, her
anxiety about her good name, everything was lost
in her profound ooncern for the safety of her beer,
Running and rolling she followed the dog, and
out from their yards came the women,
with the courage of their numbers, and
followed Mrs. Tim, along with the screaming, en-
raptured children liberated from school a few
moments before. Kid Carter joined the throng.
Botts was a dog of humor. He entered into the
spirit of the thing with rare gusto. A dozen
times Mrs. Tim seemed to have her fingers upon
him, and as often he eluded her. Then wearying
of the whole thing all in a second he dropped his
prize and fled. Mrs. Gleeson picked up the billy.
She lifted it slowly, and turned it bottom up-
wards. Not a drop of drink remained. Her
white face was tragic—it awed the women. They
felt themselves in the presence of a catastrophe.
“ Mother av hivin ! ” said Kitty in low, intense
tones, “an’ twas me last penny in the world !”
Lifting her voice to a shriek, she cried: “Where's
Morrissey ? Bring me to Mick Morrissey ! ”
Running with a queer drunken roll, she headed
for the home of the owner of Botts, and the crowd
followed. Mick, most peaceable of men, was
busy weeding his tomatoes. Mrs. Tim entered
by the front gate, and arming herself with a great
stick came upon Morrissey all unprepared, and
sent a him down with terrible whack on the head.
She recoiled herself and sat heavily among the
onions.
Morrissey lay for a minute face down in the
soft soil. Then he pulled himself together and
slowly arose, and stood staring stupidly at Mrs.
Gleeson. A sense of his wrong came to him in a
while, and with it a profound craving for ven-
geance.
“Where’s Tim Gleeson?” cried Morrissey in
his turn, and out of his gate he ran, and off in the
direction of The Lucky Brothers mine. The
crowd followed. Tim Gleeson was coming off day
shift, and the men clashed on the common.
“Yer dirty, low, dhrunken trollop av a wife
done it,” cried Morrissey, pointing to his wound.
“Ye lie!” replied Gleeson, seeing fight inevit-
able, and knowing nothing else to say.
They fought. Morrissey was too precipitate.
He was still dazed from the blow Mrs. Tim had
given him; and Gleeson was in good condition.
After three rounds, Mike was so badly knocked
about that he had to be removed to his home in a
cousin-Jack barrow. And then Kid Carter went
to tea.
He was so willing and obedient that evening,
and so good to the baby, that Mrs. Carter felt a
great gush of motherly tenderness stir her heart
as she stood by his bedside, gazing down at
the innocent happy lad smiling in his sleep.
Morrissey’s head was reported very bad next day,
but Kid never dreamed of finding any connection
between his infamy and Mike’s misfortune.

“ Melb.” : At Flemington there are,
as near as I can be troubled with counting,
two dozen fine elms in the space between
the grandstand and saddling paddock, and
beyond them, that is on the west or pad-
dock side, there are about twenty fine pine
trees, clustering by themselves in a haughty way,
in imitation of the elms. The elms seem to say
“English,” and the pines “American!” The
fashionable betting is all under the elms; gam-
bling isn’t countenanced under the pines. So
there arises the din from a tumbling ocean of
summer hats beneath the elmy shade, and the
birds are all frightened away, and bolt to the
pines for shelter. But when the nasty Cup is
over, the birds return with songful glee to the
Flemington elms.

THAT Bile Beans are an undoubted cure for
Indigestion and its attendant evils is a now

High-street, W. Maitland, writes “ About 2J years
ago I first felt the symptoms of Indigestion, which was
mainly brought about by irregular diet and insuf-

constipation, and wind on the stomach. My ill-

and it was not an unusual thing for me to stay away
from the office for two or three days together. _ Many

The Drums of Ages.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Drums of all that's right and wrong—of love and
hate and scorn,
And the new-born baby hears them and it wails
when it is born.
Drums of all that is to be, and all that has gone by,
And we hear them when we're dreaming, and we
hear them while we die.
Drums of martyred innocence and drums of driven
guilt
Beating backward from the future when the first
rude town was built;
Beating louder through the slave days and the
dark and hungry nights,
While the hovels filled the valleys and the castles
crowned the heights;
Beating louder while the mansions shifted east
from miles of slums —
Don’t you hear them ? Don’t you hear them ?
Don’t you hear the alley drums?
Drums of human sacrifice and drums of war at
home—
While the Romans conquered nations they were
beating loud in Rome.
Children heard them through the ages, mothers
paused and glanced behind,
Madmen saw and heard the drummers, but the
rest were deaf and blind.
Peasants starved on fields of plenty, workmen
rotted in the slums—
Till the drummers came to Paris and the nations
heard the drums.
Drums of hope and bursting hearts —the drums of
Westward Ho !
From the homes of generations and their native
land they go.
’Groom and bride and grey-haired mother, bent
old men who go alone—
Fleeing bitter persecution for the terrible un-
known :
Seeking freedom, rest, or justice—and. the peace
that never comes,
And the wilderness was conquered when the
pilgrims beat their drums.
Drums of Greed that followed fast where men
had made the way,
Waking drums of stern rebellion when the exiles
turned at bay,
Spreading death and desolation, breeding old-
world hells anew,
Until England lost a nation for the blindness of a
few.
Still the dirty Jewish talon reached from palaces
and slums
Till a hundred thousand English died to stop the
farmers’ drums.
Drums of tortured hearts o’ men —the drums that
never ceased —
Throbbing through the British Empire from the
heart of London East;
Growling louder still wherever, in the wake of
those who lead,
Comes the murmur of the board-room and the
stealthy steps of greed ;
Growling through the Southern cities, murmuring
in the Western gums,
Till the Empire falls to pieces at the beating of
the drums!
Drums of all that's right and wrong—of love, and
hate and scorn ;
And the new-born baby hehrs them, and he wails
when he is bom.
Drums of all that is to be, and all that has gone by —
And we hear them when we're dreaming, and we
hear them while we die.

An Improved Failure.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
On a morning of the week before I lefb the Cold
Country I read in London the hereunder printed
Bulletin par:
Re that Bulletin prophecy (20/6/’O3) to the effect that,
as the British array is about to be re-armed with a new
rifle, Australia would, doubtless, be expected to kindly
relieve the Cold Country of as many as possible of the
obsolete weapons. John Forrest stated, in the Reps.,
t’other day, that Australia had already 13,000 Lee-Enfield
and Lee-Metford magazine rifles, and that others were
being imported as rapidly as possible—7ooo Lee-Enfields
were already on their way out, and others would follow,
as soon, no doubt, as the British authorities can replace
them at ’Ome with the Lee-Enfield modified 1 Australia
has been buying Britain’s old iron at Britain’s own price
for a long time ; but surely there is a time in life when
the poorest Tommy or Johnny should refuse to do with
pa’s cast-off clothes any longer.
In the afternoon, Alf. Hales and myself were in
the offices of one of the best-known of British
gunmakers. We wandered up the stairs to talk
to him; but, as soon as the conversation turned
on guns, the Boer War came up, and the modified
Lee-Enfield, and then the Gunmaker did the
talking.
He showed us the rifle used in the South African
War, and explained that one of the reasons why
the British troops did such bad shooting was that
the rifle itself was a weapon made almost harmless
by the designers. He showed us how the first
sights, being so unreliable that a man sighting by
them could scarcely hit a haystack, were removed
from the top surface of the barrel and replaced
halfway between the top surface and the side sur-
face—an attempt to correct an error with a foolish-
it’s useless pointing out even a glaring
error like this to the authorities,” he continued.
“They persist in it rather than acknowledge a
m “*3O that an error involving the loss of £lO,OOO
may be covered up with a persistence involving
the loss of £100,000.”
“Exactly. These rifles were never any good,
and that must have been known before they were
sent to South Africa. ......
(Are these the rifles that Australia is to pay
f °The Gunmaker continued. “ For another thing,
the new rifle will be no good. It is too long in
the barrel. And they know it’s no good ; yet
special costly machinery has been built at Enfield
for these rifles, and, as you know, machinery of
that class, except for the specific work it is con-
structed to manufacture, is mere scrap iron.”
“ So this new rifle is being made at the Govern-
ment factory?”
“It isn’t. A big contract has been given to
the Birmingham Small Arms Co.”
“Mr. Chamberlain is a big shareholder of the
8.5. A., isn’t he?” I asked.
“We won’t go into that now. Another big
contract has been given to the London Small
Arms Co.”
“ And what is the Government factory doing ? ”
“Well, the Government factory has just
shortened hands.”
“In the name of all that’s senseless, what
for?”
“ You see, there are only a certain number, say
5000, of expert gun artisans in England. Some-
times we have trouble in getting men. Well,
as soon as the Birmingham Small Arms Co. and
the London Small Arms Co. received the contracts
for the new rifle, the Government shops at Enfield
obligingly dismissed 600 hands, and the two con-
tractors absorbed them at once without loss of
time or increasing wages.”
And yet the Government workshops had erected
new machinery for this special class of arm !
The expert went on to show us a bewildering
variety of guns, from flintlocks of 200 years ago
which were much surer weapons than the Enfields
of the last Boer war, to the model of the improved
Enfield, now said to be also a disappointment, and
after that we saw many kinds of magazine
apparatus, cartridge clips and improvements for
the throwing out of the used cases.
“One would think,” said I, “that the gun
artisans would be responsible for the invention of
these improvements; but the patent office records
show that they are mostly the inventions of
officers.’’
The expert smiled. “Actually they are the
inventions of workmen. But what would happen
to the workman at Enfield who patented his
invention over the heads of his superiors there?
Dismissal and probably boycott. So the work-
man, knowing this, takes his invention to an
officer, and the officer patents it in hisj own name,
thus getting a reputation for ability which he
doesn’t possess, and the actual inventor is given
a few shillings a week rise in wages.”
Then we talked guns again, and the expert
showed us how in sport there is as much fashion-
able pretence as actual love of sport. There were
braces of seventy-guinea sporting guns, silver-
mounted, and bedded in velvet. These come back
for “ repair ” every year whether they have been
used or not.
Marvellous is the extent of pretence in this pre-
tentious island, from the spick and span “ sports-
man ” who bravely slaughters a few brace of
driven birds, to the flat-chested English Miss
who brandishes a little dog whip over a waddling
Dachshund and says, in a squeaky treble, “ Down,
sir,” to the animal that is too fat to stand on less
than four legs.
Is Australia buying guns from»,.a department
that seems to be as rotten with mismanagement
as the Remount Department, or the Intelligence
Department, or the Clothing Supply Department,
and presumably every other department of the
War Office? And if, as is alleged, the misman-
agement of the British navy is almost as glaringly
idiotic as that of the British army, what is Aus-
tralia to get for its £200,000 subsidy ?
Thinking all these things, I went back to the
hotel for dinner ; and there, just as if he had
never moved since dinner last a frantic
Jingo still asserting the purity of British official-
dom—still the puppet British mon-
archical system by exaggerating the corruption in
the public life of the United States.
And the humor of tins' ostrich amused me so
that my appetite appreciated by 50 per cent.
RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
Hardshell Tories who think that the
N.S.W. Industrial Arbitration Act is all one-
sided might have got some light from part of the
Court’s proceedings recently. “The Brick-
makers and Brickcarters Employees’ Union pro-
ceeded against; a number of members for non-
payment of dues. Orders were made.” So, as
the law says, a member can’t suddenly leave off
being a member just when he pleases—when an
award is given against his union, for instance.
The union is under a heavy financial obligation
to obey every award; and the member is under
an obligation to continue his membership for a
reasonable time, and to keep the union in funds
sufficient to pay the forfeit if the award is broken.
“Caber” : A small error occurs in
Bulletin (22/10/’O3) anent the Queensland Labor
Party : George Kerr, the Barcoo blacksmith, was
not the first Laborite elected. George was one of
fifteen of 1893 ; Tom Glassey entered Parliament
in 1888 as member for Bundamba. Glassey, John
Hoolan, and T. J. Ryan were joined by G. H.
Hall, who won Bundaberg in a bye-election.
Ryan couldn’t stand his oats and left the
other three who rbfused to follow the
present Federal Chief Justice in his apostacy
of 1890. Hall was bumped out in 1893 by a couple
of votes, but Glassey won the Bundaberg seat
back next election. Not one of the first Labor
Party is now in Queensland politics.
One Australian in S’Africa, Mr. D. Mack
—a nephew of “Jimmy” Tyson—got angry at
the constant insults to his countrymen, and wrote
to the Cape Times, inter alia:
I am not referring to the class of men who came here
and served against the Boers, for those men were un-
deniably hard-up “tags” from the towns there, and few
of them typical representatives of the country. They
were glad of the bone England threw them, and would
gladly take another if they got the chance. Those fellows
are ready to slay anything for dollars. They have done
our country no good, but cast a stigma on it by their
acts in and out of the army, that will take us perhaps one
hundred years to wipe out. Pity is any of the wasters
returned to our shores. I hope you keep the balance
here, for there is little beer and music left for them if
they return now, but plenty of hominy, I guess. Neither
the first contingent nor the last, nor any other, was
composed of typical bushmen, and not a single
“station” man in my country ever thought so at any
time. The genuine Australian would, be slow to go
abroad to fight against any country, and I state emphati-
cally he is too much of a “patriot” to attempt such a
thing ; but God help any invader, be he Englishman or
anything else, for they would find Australians as patriotic
and brave as the little band of Boer warriors whom some
of my supposed countrymen came to mob for filthy lucre.
Australians are unjustly judged by people in England,
and the outside world, as being all of the same kidney as
the fellows who served. God forbid 1
After all, the S’Africans can’t be blamed for
judging us by our export samples. That’s part
of the price we have to pay. But what a quaint
satire it is when Australia has to defend its char-
acter by declaring: publicly that its “heroes”
were the scum of the country, and that owing to
the blackguardly nature of the errand on which
they went they would naturally be scum.


Reduced to a Shadow
Could Hardly Walk. Doctors Said Slow Recovery. Disappointed
Doctors and Myself by Getting Well Quickly.

Mr. Wm. B. Mackie, of Dunedin, New
Zealand, sends us his photograph and
says:
“Not long ago I was run over by a
wagon and severely injured. For weeks
I was confined to my bed. I was reduced
to a mere shadow, so weak I could hardly
walk. The doctors told me it would be a
long time before I could regain my health.
I felt I could not wait, so procured a
bottle of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. You can-
not imagine how quickly my health and
strength began to return. The first day
I felt an improvement. In a week I had
a better appetite, and was much stronger.
And only a few bottles wrought a most
marvelous change in me. I like your
medicine especially because it seems to
give just the aid nature sometimes
needs.”
“The World’s Greatest Family IVledicine.”
If you. have been sick and are not recovering rapidly, just try a bottle of
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. It is the strongest tonic you can buy, and it aids nature
wonderfully. The better, way is to take the Sarsaparilla before you get really
ill. Take it when you first begin to feel poorly. It will cure you quickly
thefi and save you much suffering and large expense. Yet even when you are
sick, you cannot find a better medicine.
There are many so-called Sarsaparillas. Be sure you get Ayer’s, the oldest,
strongest, and best Sarsaparilla. Don’t experiment with imitations.

“ELM-EV KGUCE,” 151 ELIZABETH STREET, SYDNEY
The evanishment of the Musgrove dramatic co. is a
matter for conflicting gossip. Australia loses a bright, ver-
satile actor in Beatty, anyhow. Many inferior artists have
received more credit for their work than the unassuming
gentleman who played Charles 11., Don Caesar de Bazan,
the Professor in. “ Mice and Men,” and the humorous>
bibulous father of “ Dolores.” Beatty was fairly con-
vincing, sometimes quite convincing, in several different
characters, but for the actor who strives to hide his own
personal identity in a part instead of obtruding it and
labelling it “Booster” (or whatever his name be); there
is no chance of a “star” popularity. The mannered
artificial mummer, not the finished natural actor, gets
the adoration of womankind—generally speaking.
“Hiphen”: In the “Great Millionaire,” Blandolt
gave a wonderful sketch of an Australian—Bill Balwyn,
from the Barcoo, In the very first scene you could see
he was a true ’Stralian. He carried a billy with him,
which he proceeded to boil on the stage. I didn’t see
him put any water (much less tea) in it, and when it was
(presumably) boiled he took it off the fire, packed it up
in his swag, and proceeded on the wallaby. This is what
all true Australians do. Anyone who has seen Rupert
Clarke boiling his billy in Oollins-street will know that.
“L.” : Herr Gustaye SJapoffski has found an enthusiast
who has offered £BOOO to run grand opera seasons in
Melbourne and Sydney. Herr Slap, leaves shortly to
bring out a company, which will play almost exclusively
Wagner, including the great music dramas that have
never yet been staged in Australia. Marshall-Hall, at
time of writing, was wearing a joyous smile, while the
philosophic Dietrich is exclaiming “ Ach Himmel ” and
chewing up twice his usual number of cigars. Other
Wagnerians are joyous in their respective styles.
Henry Jarrett, the Old American theatrical manager,
happened to die in London the other week. George Rig-
nold was under engagement to Jarrett when he scored
his memorable American success as Henry Vee. The
girls, young and old, chased the godlike actor in their
dreams, and strove to waylay him at all hours of the day,
thus compelling him to remain secluded in his private
rooms at the hotel, lest they might see the real George
and suffer a measure of disenchantment.
“ Altiora Peto ” : With regard to “ L.B.’s ” demand for
a national theatre (B. 12/11/’O3) it is well known that the
State-subsidised theatres of Germany, Austria and Franco
have outlived their usefulness ; that the ComiAie
Francaise, for instance, is degenerating in its standards
and in its relation to the living drama of the day. As
far as the question exists here, it is a much more difficult
one than under a less democratic Government, since such
an institution, supported by public- funds, would arouse
the hostility of a large part of the people. Private enter-
prise is much more likely than State aid to succeed in the
conversion of the theatre into an educational influence.
As libraries, colleges, music and art are largely supported
by private endowment, there is no reason why a theatre
for educational purposes should not also be founded by
some not-yet-dead Australian millionaire. A very good
example of the subscription theatre is the German
theatre in Irving Place, New York City, which often
gives more great plays in a season than all the theatres
on Broadway together.
Christie Simonsens, who has been Bland Holt’s business
manager for many years on and off, talks of returning to
ordinary commercial life. The job of “ looking after the
front of the house ” from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m., or later, for six
nights a week is probably the most weaiusome task in the
world for any man who thinks his time could be better
employed. Some attaches of the theatrical profession
dtn’t think their time could be more profitably employed
—and they are right. It couldn’t.
“ Vul.” : Whether it is the fault of Duse herself, or
whether the trouble rests with the hyper-moral outlook
of Censor Redford, it can’t be denied that the former is
suffering greatly at the hands of the latter of l’ate.
Following on his refusal of last year to grant her a license
to produce in England one of D’Annunzio’s plays, he
lately refused to allow her to stage the same author’s
“ The Dead City,” and now again declines to give her a
license for Maurice Donnay’s “ L'Ahup >anger.” While
the first two refusals in connection with D’Annunzio’s
pieces surpast understanding, this latter is moderately
understandable. The Donnay piece is rather unwhole-
some, to say the least. It treats of a bitter rivalry
between amother and her own daughter for the affections
of a man who has for some time been the aocepted lover
of the former. Even blas£ Paris is said to have been
moderately agitated over this situation.
H. M. Mack (Manila) writes: Harold Carr and Eva
M’Donald, of the Pollard company, have left the rest and
returned to their native land. Hongkong and Shanghai
were no better, financially, t nan Manila, and it now
remains to be seen whether India will “ pan out ” any
better. Am afraid not. Even the Neil-Frawley company
did poorly here. The tired European in Asia is hard to
please. Ada Delro.v’s Vaudeville troupe has been doing
good business to the soldier element, at the Orphehm,
where you can drink beer at small tables and join in the
chorus if you feel that way. Daisy Haroourt’s risque
songs meet with entire approval, especially the one,
“ Dew it Agvne,” us the Americans say she pronounces
“Do it Again.” Daisy grew angry at a man, in a stage-
box the other night, because he hissed her. She came
out and threw a glass of water in his face, then went off
crying ! Ada, the old Ada who has weathered so many
storms, still whirls and whizzes in her fir.e-danoe and
never seems to grow stiff in the knees. She must be
nearly 19 now ! Sam Rowley bawls out something about
a sundowner wanting “to hang up his hat somewhere,”
and other Australian ditties, which don’t appear humor-
ous to the ’Murkans. Manila has also made acquaintance
with the Hill-Sylvainy company from Australia, who
opened at the Zorilla Theatre. They promise to do well,
especially with the unicycle trick-riding feat down a
ladder, or something equally impossible.
Nina Boueicault—dainty Nina, of the first Brough and
Boucieault co.—plays heroine in Barrie’s new play,
“ Little Mary.” She’s the angelic cook who enthrals the
stummick of mankind.
