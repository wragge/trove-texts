The Sanctity of Life.
Archbishop Vaughan never loses sight of the
fact that ho ia a seion of one of the oldest among
tho patrician families of England. He is not only
a priest—he ia a dignitary ; he is not simply a man
—ho ia a gentleman. It must be admitted that
Dr. Vaughan, the gentleman of good family,
“ behaves as sioh.” His manners and his orations
are equally polished. Nor is tho influence merely
superficial. Dr. Vaughan has given ample evi-
dence that he ia animated by the Instincts of a
gentleman. Tho snarlings and snappiugs of under-
bred assailants and critics he disregards in lofty
serenity, and drives distracted by his social dis-
dain even men who worst him in argument. But
the degree in which tho sentiments of a patrician
enter into every fibre of the Archbishop’s nature,
and make him even more essentially a gentleman
than he is a priest, wore never more effectively
shown than by the line of argument relative to
the sanctity of human life which intruded itself
into his discourse at the opening of the Female
Refuge at Manly. The drift of this part of the
Archbishop’s deliverance was that we had fallen
upon evil days, when scepticism ia growing in
strength, and'tho sanctity of human life becoming
lightly regarded. The two conditions were offered
as things linked together—tho light regard for life
being a consequence of the scepticism.
| # *
There is no denying the accuracy of the first
part of tho prelate’s diagnosis. Scepticism is
growing apace, and the bands of faith are every-
where relaxing. Tho evidences of this condition
crop up on every hand, and from most unexpected
quarters. Clergymen, as a rule, alternately be-
wail tho fact and indignantly deny it But tho
evidence is too overwhelming for denials to be of
mueh service. In France, belief in dogma is tho
exception among the educated classes, ihe pro-
tesBional men, employes, and artizans of the great
*kes are agnostics almost to a man, and fidelity
to old creeds is abandoned with a shrug to aristo-
crats, elodhoppers, and women. In Germany the
case is even worse. From the future Empress—
daughter of our own Queen —down through all coa-
o svf e » scepticism holds sway. The thought

ful, of monarchs and of members of the ruling
caste, within the last few years, needs no demon-
stration. But this fact does not constitute
evidence that human life in the aggregate has
been more lightly regarded than heretofore. To
the priest, the slaying of “ the Lord’s anointed ”
may be a catastrophe which fills the area of his
impressions, and appears like a universal cata
olysm, leaving no room for larger iniquity. And
to the patrician, taught from infancy to regard
hi* order as important and sacred above measure,
and the common people as cf little account, it
may seem that when a Czar is sentenced and exe-
cuted—when Kings and Kaizera are shot at and
stabbed at, when generals and statesmen are
poisoned, and when well-born gentlemen in high
office are hacked to death —the world is turning
more than ever wioked in her old age, and the
sanctity of human life is held in lighter regard
than ever before.
• • •
Nothing short of tho most powerful and abso-
lute preconceptions could have blinded so studious
a man as Dr. Vaughan to the fashion in which
he was running counter to the philosophy of his-
tory. Human life held in lighter regard in these
days than heretofore! What crowds of ghosts in
bloody raiment arise and give tho lie to this libel
upon the present age ! Ghosts wearing spectral
crowns. Ghosts with diadems and shadowy in-
signia of rank. But above all, a whole nether
world of ghosts of common people, butchered to
make a Roman holiday—slaughtered to win a
woman or a province for a despot—broiled, im-
paled, starved, drowned. Baby ghosts of infants
slain by want—want due to the locust-ravages of
armies ; the horrors of wars ; the pestiferous breath
of foetid cabins—wretched that palaces might bo
splendid. Is the life of a monarch loss regarded
now than when Agamemnon fell, of a President
than when Brutus smote Cjesab, of a noble than
when crook-backed Eiohard cried “ off with his
head ” to the captsirer of Buckingham ? History
is but a record of assassinations, yet has not
noted a hundredth part of the murders whioh
have disgraced humanity. Is human life less re-
garded than when tho Conqueror of Hindustan
heaped up a pyramid of human skulls P Is it less
respected than when, at the command of the Lord,
the Israelites put every Philistine male to the
sword ? Is it less regarded thin when Tilly
ravaged the Low Countries ? Is it less respected
than when the French King stjpod at his window
and took leisurely aim at stray Huguenots fleeing
from the soldiers with the sacred cross on their
headpieces, on St Bartholomew’s Day? Is life
less regarded than, when in the name of the faith
the Archbishop professes, swarms of poor Protest-
ants wore drowned by order, in the Loire ? Pshaw!
moat learned Archbishop, the world is more tender
ol human life than ever before, despite—or is it in
consequence of?—the spread of scepticism and
modern thought.
PLAIN ENGL ISH.
Judge or Jury?
The chapter iu Mr. Justice Stephen’s last work which
deals with the system of trial by jury is interesting, for
the reason that the author's position gives him aa op-
portuuity of insight deeper than can be bad by the
majority of men outside or inside the legal profession
The result of the great English publicist’s study on this
question is, that with some hesitation he pronounces
for the retention of this system. Trial by jury has beer
for centuries iu popular estimation, as at least one of the
greatest safeguards of personal individual liberty aad
right. Justice Stephen weighs the matter well, and
states pro and contra the arguments that may bo em-
ployed. But he ends by giving the weight of his an-
undoubted authority in favour of trial by jury;
in brief, because thereby a certain popularity is”
conferred upon the legal procedure. With all
respect for Mr. Justice Stephen’s authority, we
prefer to defend the system on the ground
that it furnishes a check upon the ignorance, lh® auto-
viatic tendencies, or the bias of judges. Let us not
understood as petulant'y reviling a great office. The
danger of these colonies, with so free and democratic
a constitution as they have, is that the judicial bench
may cotre to be occupied by not merely second-rate
men, but by downright bad men, and that judgeships
may be regarded as the epolia opima of a defeated party.
And with dunces or knaves upon the Bench, wo should
soon find out what abarrier the jury is. We have bad
judges who have brow-beaten juries and sought to in-
timidate them into giving a verdict according to the
summing-up. What has been once may be again.
What man would rather su' mit his case to a judge of
strong bias and autocratic bearing than to a jury
even to a jury of four ?
Mr. Tighe's Proteges.
Mr. Tighe's speech, oa Friday night, against commit-
ting the power of the lash to the Police Magistrates,
was not devoid of strength, but the feature of the
night’s exhibition was Mr. Cohen’s weak-1 need accept-
ance of the amendment. For a Minister of Justice to
declare by his act in Parliament that his 6Wu officers—
men with so much power placed in yieir tends—had
not the ability to separate boyish freaks from larrikin,
istic mischief and disorderliness, was an imputation
upon the Police Magistrates of the colony and upon
himself. Let us hope that tho Bill will bo put to rights
in this respect when it reaches the Council. Tho power
which tho city magistrates have desired so long the
power to teach tho hoodlums of the streets through
their skin that women and children, tho aged and sickly,
are not fair game—that to destroy trees and flowers;
to disfigure tho graves of the dead, and break windows,’
are not "fun," but are defiance of tho State, and an out’
rage—is to be denied them. Let anyone go into tho
Police Courts for a few hours, and see the stout strap,
ping fellows, lads and men, that are brought «p on
charges of all sorts of Vandalism, obscenity, and oat-
rage, and observe the readiness with which tho fine is
paid; and tfien let him ask hyaself if the lash would
not be a tetter remedy than this fine, which is so
lightly felt. We are sick of this rose-water philan-
thropy. If a lad or man is convicted of any' of the
offences tabulated iu the bill as larrikluisw, be ha
well-connected or not. good boy or bad boy, let his Ja.
tegumenta suffer, not his father’s purse.
Consumptive
Even a worm will turn, and the Dah.y Telusraiti
writhes at the Echo for remarking upon the Aefeetive
physique which may be observed among the people.
— 1 0 remarks of the Echo are inano enough. "Scro-
fulous babies,” “sickly puking children,” and bac*ie
girls with hollow cheeks, "telling that she is bloasam.
iug full quickly unto death," are to te seen if Jooked
for, sure enough. But such are to be met in evegy
Anglo-Saxon community. As the Echo doesn’t pretend
that those symptoms e£ early decay are more numerous
bore than elsewhere, it might have spared its Jere-
miads, and the Daily Telehraph needn’t have become
hysterical about the "malignant misrepresentation,'’
and shriek such bosh as “ away, then, with these un-
founded calumnies, which must excite the contempt and
indignation of every honest and patriotic inhabitant c i
Australia.” But the facts seem to bo that the Bene,
being under an obligation not to touch upon any of th*
real evils which sap the vitality and morality of the
community—aa to speak plain English about skunks
and their ways would be regarded by the proprietors
as "unbecoming”—has to mouth about tny harmless
truism which admits of a little unmeaning eloquence j
while the Daily Telegraph is preteraatuxally irritablj
and sensitive to anything having the signs of early
death printed on its face. To the D T. such remarks
appear personal.
Servants Out of Livery.
The conviction of Mr. Moore, Curator ef the Botanical
Gardens, for using insulting language likely to cause a
breach of the peace, will commend itself to the public.
Whether Mr. Moore used the particular words as*
oribed to him is not material. It was evident, even
from his own testimony, that his address was over-
bearing and insulting. The attitude of the complainant,
holding his fainting wife in his arms, was, no doubt,
suspicious, and in view of the prevalence of larrikin
embracemeuts, Mr. Moore was only discharging his
duty in interfering. But servants of the public are too
apt, especially when in positions of authority, to fo*got
that they arc servants, and not masters. Mr- Modrb
should have conducted his interference with ordinary
courtesy at the outset. If the person so rudely
accosted by a stranger bearing no external symbol of
authority had knocked the insol On t-toned Intruder
down, there would have been no occasion for surprise.
Mr. Moore appeared to be as bounceblo in the Polio*
Court as iu the Gardens. He scouted the decision of
the magistrates, and threatened to toll his big brother,
the Government. The incident is certainly deserving
of the attention of the Government, and should in-
duce them to consider whether Mr. Moore is not d«-
serving of a reprimand—a warning to cultivate civility
in his attitude towards the people of the colony who
own and use the Gardens; and, moreover, whether the
necessity of putting Mr. Moore and other gardeners
m livery, so that their official authority should be
recognizable at a glance, has not been demonstrated.
A foolish fellow down in Melbourne has gone to law
with a lawjer iu respect of a matter affecting bar-
risters in general. He is one John Meanet, and he
sues John Fisher, barrister-at-law, for £98 damages,
for neglecting to defend him after accepting a retainer of
two guineas to do so. The case involves what lawyers
would call the nice point, whether grocers are bound
to supply sugar after accepting your order and cash iu
advance——no, whether barristers are bound to appear
for a client after taking a fee. Jchn Meanby cannot
be fully aware of the fact that for a man to bo an
officer of a Court of Justice has from time immemmorial
been regarded aa investing him with a sacred right t«
swindle clients. The nearer the law, the farther fro*

Stale Revelations.
Why the revelations in the Melbourne Bankruptcy
Court, with respect to the masterly manner in which
Aaron Waxman, J P, and Marks Herman fleeced
William Petit by usury, should be styled “extra-
ordinary disclosures,” as they have been in the daily
journals, we fail to see. It is a matter of common
knowledge that silly lambs are being skinned by know.
Ing wolves, in this very fashion, all the time. Parti-
cular instances come before the pub ic, from time to
time, and on each occasion feeble people break out into
spasms of astonishment, as though such things had
never been dreamt of before. There is a nine days’
wonder, and then astonishment goes into recess, to
spring forth fresh and unexhausted on the very next
occasion. But nothing is dene to remely the evil.
The subject of the usury laws has teen discussed in
philosophic treatises, whieh have merely served to
confuse ideas, and to inculcate a notion that any remedy
would merely intensify the evil. Usury, we are told,
would still go on, no matter how stringent the restric-
tions imposed by law. The risks of prosecution would
merely be added by the lender to the present risk
of non-payment, and the only effect would be
that heavier interest than ever would be demanded
by way of extra-insurance. Bnt even if the penalty
of usurious lending were death, money-sharks could
not demand more than 1403 per cent., which was the
rate extorted from Petty. There is a necessary limit
ef risk which even money-lenders would decline to
undertake at any price, and which would operate to
divert their employment of capital to other and
houester uses. As matters stand, Waxman, J.P., and
Marks can afford to grin comfortably in the face of the
Judge who has been seized of their sooundrelism, and
that functionary does not appear to have regarded
himself called upon even to reprimand them. The
weight of his censure fell upon the fool instead of the
rogues, and it was Petty, the victim, whe was held up
to public scorn, by an inquiry whether he was in his
proper senses. Supposing ha were on imbecile, the
moral offence of those who plundered him was surely
not lessened. There is some manliness in crying
“Standand deliver" to a stout fellow, but humanity
recognizes as utterly detestable the offence of the
paltry scoundrel who takes advantage of a prey weak in
body or in mind. The Waxman concerned in this
affair is the man who bad Marccs Clarke in his
clutches for years, and up to the day of his death.
Marcus was rash and improvident, perhaps, but the
chance he had of extricating himself, once he had made
the fatal blunder of seeking temporary relief from
Waxman, may be understood by the light of these
revelations, by any who did not comprehend them
before. We should be glad to welcome a law which
handed over to the laah the backs of all usurers who
could not show that their charges bore a fair relation
to the risks they undertook. In this instance, while
charging enormous interest, these bloodsuckers actually
held for a loan of little more than 41000—mostly repre-
senting interest accrued—security worth 415,000 or
416,000 !
Mr. Copeland’s Dyspepsia.
Mb. Copeland's explanation of his lapse at the St
Patrick banquet was by no moans happily conceived
The ex-Minister dwelt in tedious detail upon the
physical causes of his intoxication, and led his hearers
on a somewhat repulsive voyage of discovery round the
interior of his stomach, liver, and biliary ducts. All
that he recounted could have been better and more
effectually condensed into a single sentence. “ I was
fasting, and had been indisposed owing to change of
habits from active exercise to stooping over a desk, and
due to too intense application to my Ministerial duties.
A very little liquor had, under the circumstances, un-
foreseen effect, I was taken by surprise, betrayed
au enemy, when I thought I was resorting to a friend."
The style in which Mr. Copeland dilated upon this
part of his excuse seriously impaired the effect of his
explanation, and has served to divert attention from
the real extenuations he was able to offer. It was
manly independence, and indication of a disposition
which scorned to return kindness with ungrateful cir-
cumspection, which determined Mr. Copeland to be
present at the banquet, despite the remonstrances of
his more cautious, mere sectarian, or more time-serving
colleigues. The epitome of his work as Minister was
frank and effective, and afforded undisputable indication
that he bad not disappointed, in this respect, the expec-
tations of the electors. That ho had saved the country
some £16,000, which, but for his intervention, would
have gone into the pockets of private landowners, for
which the sum had been destined by the late Govern-
ment, requires elucidation in detail. The accuracy of
the fact was not and has not yet been challenged. If
they be established, most colonists will be of opinion
that they would greatly prefer to see as Minister a man
who, although he once appeared intoxicated in public,
saved the people from spoliation, rather than a sleek
individual of unimpeachable comportment who would
wink at wholesale plunder.
A Devil’s Holiday.
There has been a Devil’s Holiday—a Lawyer’s Jubilee
—in Parliament during the past two weeks. The in-
terests of the profession have been engaging the
devoted care of its votaries. The Criminal Law
Amendment Bill has been shepherded through com-
mittee with a jealous watchfulness lest by any aooidont
amendment should take the form of cheapening any
process between lawyer and client. Then the Judges'
salaries have been attended to. It is well to be kindly
regarded by “your Honor." The emoluments of those
powerful dignitaries have been voted by the Assembly
a step nearer what is paid by tbe thirty millions
of people in Qroat Britain. Then their pensions have
been increased, and next the pensions of Judges who
once had been. It would only be necessary to increase
the pensions of Judges who might have been, to cap
the climax of absurdity. Mr. Da it LET, who is re-
garded as a probable successor of the present Chief
Justice —when that dignitary, worn out with fifteen
years’ leave of absence, with intervals of work, shall
retire on a pittance of £2450 per annum—was the
most ardent champion, in the Upper House, of the
proposed increases. The drift of the discussion was
quite instructive. Every sort of argument was adduced,
except that of. the interests of suitors In fact, the
people were out of it. To mention them was to pro-
voke a snub. “ In the name of goodness 1" cried Mr.
Darlet, much scandalized, “ what had population to
do with the question? Might not a Judge be just as
hard worked in a population of 700,000 as iu a popula-
tion of 7,000,000 ?’* It was not worth considering that
tho population might be bard-worked too, and that
700,000 people vjould have to contribute tea times as
much of the fruits of their labour to provide a certain
sum, as 7,000,000 would have to mulct themselves.
There is a limit to what 700,000 people can afford. An-
other of Mr. Oaklet's contentions shows a misappre-
hension of what constitutes dignity. " These Judges,
he said, “ had not only to provide for themselves and
their families, but to keep up the dignity of their posi-
tion.” Now, dignity is not an external but an internal
quality. A carriage and pair give false dignity. A
consciousness of rectitude gives true dignity. DoosMr,
Dablet mean that Sir James Martin would be devoid
of the true dignity appertaining to his noble position if he
continued to have only £2600 a year, and that £3500 a
year would supply the want P Is dignity commensurate
with income, and controlled by it ? But it is vain to
talk. The lawyers in Parliament are numerous and
active. The remedy will come hereafter, when a demo-
cratic Assembly will sweep away the monstrous burdens
now being imposed upon the shoulders of the people,
and insist that the honour of being a Judge is in itself
equivalent to much lucre.
Caret’s “ evidence” as to the complicity of the Land
League with the assassins turns out to bs of the most
flimsy character. Here is the whole of it Walsh in-
troduced ns to a man at the Angel, whom we after-
wards discovered was disguised, and I was told be was
SHBRfbAN. He was disguised as the Rev. Father Murpht
Carry further depesed that they got arms and the knives
from London, through the instrumentality of a man
named Btrne, whose wife brought them over and helped
in the arrangements for the assassination of Mr. Fors-
ter. “No. 1” was a respectable, gentlemanly-looking
man. Ho never told me anything of his position or cir-
cumstances. I got money from him on three occasions
—two twenties and a forty. He told me there would
be no ligait to money ; if wo required £1000 we shou’d
have it. Mcllett, Curlet, and I often talked amongst
ourselves as to whence the money came. Wo were
divided in opinion. I expressed the opinion that
it came from America; some of the others said, ** Per-
Imp* wo are getting some of this from the Land
League.” I know from Curlet and M’Caefrbt that
when in gaol as suspects Curlet received a cheque for
£5, and M’Caffret one for £6, which he refused. They
believed the money was sent by the Land League.
Mrs. Frank Btrne, who was arrested in London and
taken to Dublin on suspicion of being the woman who
conveyed the revolvers, ammunition, and knives to the
Invinolbles, was confronted with Caret, the informer,
who failed to indentify her. She was, therefore, dis-
charged.

His sympathies are naturally dead against the tenant

Pins II. before him. What was this but t he cry of a
landlord F The Land League movement is purely
agrarian. It is merely a chance that the people who
have felt the pressure most heavily, and have, there-
fore, been the first to find it intolerable, are Roman
Catholics. If you think that because the Irish are fere-
most in the field of agrarian reform, the Church of
Rome is favourable, you are utterly mistaken. That
Church is dead against any readjustment of social
arrangements. The Pops and Dr. Barry would agree

Bat we think the voice from the grave in the instance
you send us might have paid a little more attention to
the poetic unities :—
•* Weep not for me, my darling wife,

I was not yours but the Lord's alone,
He loved me best and took me home.”
In the effusion (purporting to come from him) which
we have just quoted, there is more pathos than poetry;
but there is not very much pathos. And there is no
rhyme. We note this because it will have a beneficent
effect upon parsons of suicidal tendencies. You see.
dear “Bolt," that when it is generally known that
better poetry than that can’t be blown out of a celestial
trump, people won't wish to die. Something in this
style would, perhaps, be more convincing as coming
from a departed spirit:—
I am up hero, Anna,
Living upon manna,
Singing and a flying all the day;
Love to little Folly,
OI feel so jolly,
Hope that Bobby’s good now I’m away.

for a member of Parliament to advertise “ Land busi-

more than mere convenience of address. But, under

TRANCE TO THE MARKETS.
The Autophono is a wonderful little instrument,
which, while it weighs less than throe pound,, has the
lungs of a full-sized parlour organ, and executes its
music with absolute precision and perfect effect.
It has twenty-two reeds, plays in three keys, and all
the parts of most difficult music.
On it, a child can correctly play, without instruction,
any of its music, which at present consists of over 300
selections from Hymns, Oratorios, Operas, Waltzes,
Polkas, Marshes, Popular Songs, &o. It is best adapted
to the kind of mnsio which suits an organ best, in which
chords predominate, but also has wonderful power in
executing very lively pieces.
It is pitched for the voice or orchestra, and has a
little card holder for convenience in singing. Any
Orchestral Instrument, Violin, Flute, Ac., can be
played to accompany the Autophono.
It is entirely well.adapted for Country Churches,
Sunday Schools, the Family Circle, and also for Danc-
ing.
The AUTOPHONE is like every other good thing,
the longer you have it, the better you like it, and as new
mnsio is being publnhed every week, it has an endless
fund of amnsement in it.

Extract from the Continental Gazette,
Paris.
The most surprising triumph for an American product
at the Paris Exhibition was the success of £. Anheusor
& Co.’s Brewing Association of St. Louis, which
eelipsed Bass, Barclay and Perkins, Alsop 4 Guinness,
the world-renowned English brewers, as well as hun-
dreds of rivals from Austria and Bavaria. It is not
surprising that a great sensation was produced when it
was understood that the experts reluctantly pro-
nounced the St. Louis beer “ superior to any malt
Kqnor ever drank upon the continent,” and that all
Paris is now seeking to quaS the American nectar.

CABINET MAKING IN THIS COLONY.
Why is New South Wales so behind in this particular
industry P We do not know; no one appears to know!
One thing certain, no timber appears to be mneb used
but cedar. How is this ? Have we no woods in our
colony suitable ? This is just what we are trying to find
out, and with this in view we are offering a prize of £20
for the best descriptive essay upon the woods of New
South Wales. At our Factory we have been making
up Walnut, American Walnut, but why should wo use
Foreign Timber when we doubtless have useful and
valuable wood growing in our own colony ? We have
given publicity to the notice of this Prize Essay since
the 21st March, but to the present time have bad not
one enquiry respecting it, vTe venture to express a
hope that the country papers will take an interest in
the matter and assist us m obtaining a work ot value,
not only to ourselves but to the Colony generally.

—"To those unacquainted with the surroundings of
Captain Sfandish’s death, it will, no doubt, seem strange
that the Freemasons did not display the insignia of the
craft over the remains ef one who occupied, while
alive, such a high position In the order as Captain
Standlsh did. The fact is that, on his death-bed, the
captain became reconciled to the Church, and received
the rites ef his religion. As Lord Eipon gave up the
high social position of Grand Master of the Freemasons
(afterwards accepted by the Prince of Wales), and
beeame a Catholic, as also did Captain Blandish con-
form to the praotioa of the Catholic Charoh, to whose
backing he became reconciled, and expressed a wish
that his funeral should be a private one.'’ In reprint-
ing this, we may onoe more be permitted to remark
that Captain Blandish died of softening of the brain
tad a lot of other things, and that the unfortunate
gentleman was, long prior to his death, in a state of
mt-imbmllity. The prints, it is true, clutched him
at the last. The crow dutches even the dead lion.

In due time he painted “ Elaine”—a magnificent work,
the engraving of which is in our awn picture-sellers’
windows. It waa very highly praised by critics, and,
consequently, with the cunning—those afflicted with
Juden-hetze would say the ingratitude—of his race,
Rosenthal refused to part with it for the sum agreed
upon. Whereupon another lady bought it for 2000
dollars. When it was sent over to 'Frisco it waa ex-
hibited, and brought 1500 dollars in this way to the
funds of the Orphan Asylums there. One evening, just
before the exhibition was closed, a couple of hoodlums
cub the picture out of the frame aud carried it away
with them. They didn’t do this out of a love of art you
may be sure. They intended to keep it until it should be
ransomed. But the lady who had bought it refused to
pay a cent to get it back. And so in a cellar in Tar
Plat—among rum-bottles, cigar-boxes, and the proceeds
of a hundred petty larcenies—ley this flrstfrnlt of
genius, until the detectives dropped upon the thieves,
one fine day, and rescued it. Since then Rosenthal has
painted several splendid pictures—one of them, “ The
Female Academy Alarmed," containing aearly 3T0
figures. In person he is a mean-looking little Israelite,
with a complexion like dried banana-akin. His father
may be seen any day mending old clothes in one of the
little back Janes of 'Frisco. There is only one other
Californian artist of any account His name is Bill,
and he is short-sighted, and paints with a putty-knife.
/We can beat this. We have an artist here who paints
with a trowel, standing with his back to the canvas
and throwing the colours over his shoulder. >
v 'vAt Melbourne, on Friday last, Judge Higin-
bothapi accepted the petition for divorce instituted by
Mr. F. J. Hickling against his wife on the ground of
her adultery with Mr. Davenport Bromfleld. This case'
has excited great attention in Victoria, where the peti-
tioner and the lady’s family have long oooupied an in-
fluential and honourable position. Mrs. Hickling, who
is somehow about 34 years of age, and is the daughter
of the late Mr, J. Q. Wore, of Koort-koortuong and
other stations, was married when a minor, to Mr, Hick-
ling, who has, up to the present time, been manager of
the_ Warrnambool branch of the National Bank of Vic-
toria. There are, as issue of the marriage, five children,
of whom one was taken away by the respondent when
she eloped to New Zealand. Mr. Bromfleld is a vigorous
Dou Juan of sou of Mr. Astley Bromfleld, equally
well-known in tho potato city as a chemist and as an
owner of racehorses. Warrnambool, which contains
several hundred eligible spinsters and about two or
more eligible bachelors, is one of those delightfully
Arcadian places where parents think that their ohU-
dron are born without original gin, and where tho
unsuspecting husband cheerfully allows his spouse
to hold commune beneath tho stars with tho guileless
bank clerk who looks at matrimony through the wrong
end of a telescope and rests his claim to social and
other distinction on the accuracy of his hair-parting
and on tho possession of a monthly honorarium of six
pounds sterling. Well, Mrs. Hickling, like the « Vil-
lags Blacksmith’s" daughter, used to sing sweetly in
the church choir; and unlike that poetic beauty, had been
partially bo tried out in easting •* sheep’s eyes " at a nig-
ger-minstrel. He waa one of these roving bnrnt-oork
tenors who, unsated after enjoying for six days and
nights a week the admiration of the fair, volnnteer
for the choir on the Sawbath that they may bask,
as white men and in all the glory of unlimited
hair-oil and shirt-collar, in the smiles of beauty
aud fashion All the time, she waa also “ carrying on"
with Mr. “Forty" Bromfleld, and when her better.half
remonstrated, she and Forty cleared for New Zealand,
where they are it is understood now living as Mr. and
Mrs “Davis." Mrs Hickling has something lift
£1000 a year in her own right. Much sympathy is felt
for her unfortunate husband.
Many Australians know tho works of Edwin
James, the novelist, who writes better paetry than two-
thirds of the professed bards. In the Would, recently,
he had a copy of verses on the Palais Bourbon, apply-
ing, of course, to the death of Qambotta. The first
stanza strikes us as being very bright ■—
*• Across the bridge, the self-same way.
Ho went to drag an empire down;
Across tho bridge, to take a town,
He oamo a conqueror to-day ;
A vanquished conqueror, whose orown
In dead wreaths on his ooffia lay."
Mr. James does not often drop into poetry, unfortu-
nately; though, at the same time, a fondness for verse
has in manv oases militated against an author's success
in prose. Look at Mies Mnloek, the author of " John
Halifax, Gentleman,” for example. She appears to
have devoted herself entirely to religious verse, and
her prose is now mere sentimental, canting drivel. Yet
she Is a woman of phenomenal attainments. The Hon.
Mrs. Norton erred in a like manner; and even George
Eliot’s late metaphysical verse was little more than
mediocre, while poetry moat undoubtedly affected her
prose-powers. Perhaps the best of all the minor
London poets is Clement Scott; while the worst is,
perhaps, Teddy Oxenford, the " Melancholy Jacques’ 1
of SociETT- Henry 8. Leigh used to shine, but ho is
now too old j and Ashby Bterry’s Jingling effusions are
very ephemeral. Neither George R. Sims nor W. 8.
Gilbert oau rank as poets in the truest acceptation of
the term, aud W. 8. Mills and Herman Motivate are
mere builders up of dramatic piles of blank verse.
With the exception of Gilbert, oddly enough, England
cannot boast of a single satirist—the productions of
the authors of tho “ Coming K ,’* &o. (said to be
identical with these of the “Silver King”), being
almost beneath notice. The last poetical satire we
remember was one published by the Hon. E. Choi-
mondoeley Pennell, and called " Puck on Pegasus,”
which, though bright in parts, lacked force and polish.
Its author, after his failure as a satirist, took to writing
joke books, since which every person with a well-con.
stituted mind has been wishing him dead and buried.
There is really a chance for a satirist in the old country.
Now, gentlemen of the “ gray goosequilll ’* Now,
Alfred I
Mr. Donald Manaon, who travelled and resided
in these colonies during the Exhibition years as repre-
sentative of the Waltham Watch Company, is very*
likely to pay us a visit again some of these days. Man-
son is a wonderfully well informed man, has travelled
in every part of the world, and has ail the charming
polish of manner which distinguishes that true cosmo-
polite—a cultured American gentleman. In New York;
Mr. Manson is a considerable person in oommeroial
circles, and his recognised ability and wide scope of
information have given him a standing in the literary
world seldom reached by a commercial man. Ho is a
member of the celebrated Lotos Club, In fact, be
being a bachelor, that club is his residence; and
ho waa asleep in his bed-room when the recent Are
occurred which gutted the reception-rooms at a time
when a collection of paintings by the best artists in the
city was on view there. When Manson returned from
the colonies he was interviewed on behalf of tho N. Y.
Tribune, and his opinion relative to the colonies were
noted. He gave the palm to protectionist Victoria
over free-trade N.S. Wales. “ My attention,” said Mr.
Manson, “ was first called to the relative effects of free-
trade and protection in the Australian colonies by the
fact that watches which were sold in Victoria for 65s.
a piece after a dnty of 22 per cent, had been paid on
them, oost 75s. and 80s. in the so-called free-trade
colony of New South Wales, where they paid no duty.
This set me to making inquiries, aud I found that the
livelier competition in Victoria created by the
tariff policy of the oolony compelled the sale,
not only of watches, but also of other lines
of goods at a lower rate of profit than in New South
Wales, where the absence of keen competition had in-
creased the cost to the o insumer nearly 40 per cent.
New South Wales is spoken of as a free-trade oolony,
aud the luxuries of life, such as watches, clocks, jewel-
lery, silks, and other articles used chiefly by the rich,
are admitted free, whereas duty is laid on sugar, teas,
coffee, spices, rice, confectionery, biscuits, cheese, and
almost all the necessaries. They are reall> heavily
vtaxed, some of the artioles’at even a higher rate than in
the protective colony of Victoria. The only industries
in the way of manufactures that ore prosperous in
New South Wales are those upon which there is
levied a very high and exorbitant rate of duty.”
Mr. Manson enumerates tobaoco, refined sugar, and
confectionery as protected manufactures. It might be
considered strange that, as representative of foreign
exporters, Mr. Manson should prefer the protectionist
theory; but it must be remembered that his own busi-
ness, the Waltham Watch Company, came into exist,
enoe under the favour of a protectionist tariff, and
has so grown under that shelter that it can now com-
pete in the markets of the world. In faot, it can’t turn
out its watches fast enough for the demand, due to a
recognition of their in variable excellence, although the
factory makes over 1600 finished watches every working
day.
That grand Fakeha Maori, Judge Maning, is
suffering from oapeer, and lies at the point of death in
London. He writes to an Auckland paper a long letter
which shows with what Spartan fortitude the lion-
hearted old man meets bis doom. Ihe Karl of
Pembroke (to whose pen we owe that most charm-
ing of all Australasian books, “ South Sea Bubbles/*)
thus described the Judge, who is now dying:—“ He
i was, I believe, sixty years old when I first saw him, but,
in spite of bis age, looked the finest man for strength,
activity, and grace. I had ever seen. Six feet three in
height, and big in proportion, with a symmetry of shape
that almost disguised his immense size, I felt I could
well understand the stories I had heard of his popularity
and bis feats amongst the Maories, especially when 1
watched the keen, bright, expression of his humorous
Irish face. In manner and conversation he was the
opposite of what one would expect of a man who had lived
since his boyhood amongst savages Withja real love, and
a considerable knowledge of literature, a keen apprecia-
tion of all intellectual excellence, and a most delightful
humour, 1 think I never camo across so charming a
talker as the man whom I may not inaptly christen the
•Lever’of New Zealand" Judge Mauing, In this his
farewell letter to hie old friend, Wickham, of the Free
lew#;, defends New Zealand from the charges made
against it by the Exeter Hall howlers, os regards the
treawtoonk extended to the Maoris by the whites, re-
marking that the only enemy the Maori has to be pro-
tected against is himself. After detailing the liberal
Parliamentary representation and equal legal rights
conceded to the Maoris, the Judge remarks i—“ I have
told my questioners hers that the Maoris, far from
helpless, have not unfreqaently beaten our best
jpqops, who were far better armed than themselves ;
jthoKmany of them I had seen, come Into courts as
/advocates in important oases of disputed titles of great
value, oondnot the case with perfect propriety, ex-
amine and cross-examine scores of witnesses, and, in
conclusion, make speeches of six, eight, or ten hoars'
duration, not missing a point to their advantage . . .
bat they have an utter want of providence—a disregard
for the future—as they say themselves, their desire is
to eat the land new while they live, and not leave it for
those who come after them to eat I I told them, too,
that a few who had taken a wiser course were rich, or
well to do, receiving rents to a good amount, and that
there was nothing to prevent the whole race being far
better oft than the peasantry of any country in the
world, but their own improvidence and extravagance
and disregard of the future. . , I did not forgot to
say that the very first use made of their privileges by
these poor oppressed beings was to turn out the Govern-
ment, which they certainly did by their votes. I do not
care to bo looked on as a romancer, so I shall not say
any more to auyoie. . , My London friends stared
when I painted to them what I once saw. an old tattooed
native chief riding in a first-rate carriage, bought for
him in London, with fine harness, and an English
ooaohman in livery, his flue house, j ust finished, burnt
to ashes at the great house-warming before the paint
was dry; same carriage, a year after, all smashed,
dragged with green flax ropes to market loaded with
plpies and potatoes for sale, and the chief himself
sued for thousands of pounds of debts, his big old
long knees sticking oat from holes in his trousers.
I am sorry I am prevented from writing a book, an
endeavour to make out some of the ancient history and
migrations of tho Maori race, of which I have got some
very surprising glimpses. I can look at tho prospect of
death with equanimity, thank God, and hopa I may do
so to the end. It is the long pain I repine at. ,
The priests tell ue many tales, and we really know
nothing of the future, nor why all things exist. . , ,
The doctors have virtually given me up. They say aa
operation would very probably bill me, and certainly
fcbt make a cure, but might cause me to linger out some
—not very long-time, and that the disease would come
on again- ... I have nothing more to say but fare-
well. I have nothing more to do in this world but to
die as quietly as I can. The doctors say they can pre-
vent me having too much pain. I may linger out
several months, and so might have time to get a line or
two from you, which would be a great pleasure. This
is a miserable climate—dark, dismal, foggy, oold. Oh,
how 1 do long to get back to that lovely land and
climate where tho sun shines and the country is so pic-
turesque, to die amongst you all, my friends. It oannot
be, however j I must linger out a certain space in pain,
and remain in what i« to me a foreign land. Now, fare-
well, my dear air, and farewell beautiful New Zealand I
Would that I might rest there; but it oannot be.—
Tours very sincerely, F. E. Making.’*

One of the cleverest critics of the present dav-
it. Frederick Wodmore, to wit—writes to prove that
staie Is undergoing a levival. This revival is.
to him. two-fold—a revival of play-writing
» revival of acting. There has teen, he says, a
? of barrenness in dramatic authorship and in act-
uJ-thonah there have been a few high stars to keep
.sVtrua ideal before us, yet the bulk of the profession
insisted for most part either of relics of old rant-
““ or spurious results of the taste for smartness
i dlsnlay which characterise the new. But now that
fa, stage has grown respectable, the profession at large
Uftod Itself up to the new level. "There are,” he
« Mft ny high-elass London manager will be able
" y Ai ns whole groups of young ladies and gentlemen
for an appearance. Of the men, some are Uni-
mtsIIt men; many are public school men. Twenty
vmn ago. the Church, the Bar, or, let us say, the W ar-
nflee-among those only would their choice have lain.
Of ths women, a smaller number, but still not a number
th»t U altogether insignificant, have hitherto known no
IBs but gentle life. They will bring on to the stage the
traditions of the parsonage house—at all events the
house of a gentleniaB. And the rest—these others
who crowd the rooms of the fashionable teachers of
elocution and of the art of acting, or ask thank,
folly to begin with, the smallest roles in the comedies
-some of them, of course, are merely stage-struck,
instances merely of ambition unsupported by ability:
but others, and the most of them, are young persons of
good parts; and on the stage, it should be frankly said,
good parts are not confined to qualities of brain. The
legitimate place, in theatrical representation, cf beauti-
ful form and colour, of pleasant voiots, and of the
native gift of gracious gesture is a very much larger
one than conventions! criticism has been accustomed
to allow. So, from among the agreeable and engaging
ft all ranks the stage is getting its recruits.” This ia
very pretty and rose-coloured, nnd, we dare say, per-
fectly warranted by facts, but it does seem odd that we
can never get more than one or two, at the most, of
these birds of Paradise out hero. Regarding the revival
la dramatic authorship, Mr. Wedmore instances Mr.
F. W. Broughton, Mr Theyre Smith, Mr. Herman
Merivale, Mr. Pinero, Mr, Sydney Grundy, Mr. B. G.
Stephenson, Ur. Brandon Thomas. Messrs. Jones and
Herman, and last, bat not least, Mr, G. B. Sims, as
examples of the new school. We had a great re-
spect for Mr. Sima, anyhow, until we saw his
last piece — 44 The Romany Eye ” — at the Eoyal.
In our opinion, this p'ay is unpardonable. It has
neither wit, pathos, nor the semblance of wit or pathos.
Yet Mr. Wednore includes it among those be quotes as
44 the most conspicuous instances that can now be
mentioned of the acceptance by the public of a robust
return to drama whioh, without being simply sen-
national, shall have in it the interest cf woll-oompioted
story, sad shall deal, net with trivial things, but with
the deeper matters of love and fortune, whioh, after all,
move humanity the most and stay with it the longest ”
Oiacun a son gout: we don't wish to pit our opinion
against that of one who is, as we said before, among the
eUverest critics of the age, yet we differ from him—we
mildly and respectfully differ Perhaps the play has
lost some of its freshness and point by coming across
ths water. Perhaps anything; but this wo know, it is
mush too thin for us now. We were as much grieved
as surprised, however, to see that Mr. Wedmore never
even mentioned the names of George Darrell or Julian
Thomas among the rising playwrights of the new
school. Which shakos oar faith in him as a critic con-
tolerably,

The shows this week, like the Art Exhibition,
are pretty nearly ail portico. Really, there is nothing
new to say anything new about, and this statement is
not new either. The Boyal runs the same piece, so the
Opera House, so Hegnrty’e Haunt. The Gaiety only
has a novelty—nnd Sheridan is not a novelty. Louise,
however, as Camille, has developed a power wa never
suspected in htr before. The pourtrayal of contem-
porary emotion is evidently Let forte. She ia not by
nature either classic or n adieeval. Mr. Sheridan plays
in Irinh drama at the end of the week. Wo haven't the

Adam Kirpor, a Chicago German, has the longest beard
in the world. lie has not shaved since he was 16.
When, as a young man, he entered the German army,

sioned him induced him to sacrifice it. Soon after-
wards he wont to America, where be has since resided,

and at the present time the American papers say it
measures exactly 12$ feet. When he goes ont he rolls
it round a leathern girdle, whioh is attached to his
waist; but within doors be allows it to hang down its
full length, enveloping his feet in it if the weather
happens to be cold. As he is new growing old, be has
made his arrangements for what is to be done with his
beard after death. By the terms of his will, it ia to be
cut off and sold to any amateur of such natural phe-
nomena who will pay the highest price for it, the money
to be handed over to his son, who, singularly enough,
though verging on 40, is as beardless as a yonth of 14.

The Herald baa certainly a most unfortunate
propensity for bungling over items of English intelli-
gence. With a power miraculous and awe-inspiring, it
sometimes restores from the peace and quiet of the
grave some individual long since gathered to his fore-
fathers, as, for instance, when it appointed Mr. Isaac
Butt, to the position of J edge of the Probate Court,
that gentleman having died many years ago; while some-
times, again, it performs a miracle not less astounding
by causing some unhappy wretch to die twice, as when
it announced the death of Major-General Carey, ” for
some time Aeting-Governor of Victoria.” Now, that
Carey died about nine years ago, while the recently de-
ceased one never was Governor of Victoria, or any other
place, but filled the office of Deputy Adjutant-General
in Australia, on the staff of General Pratt. Mr.

THE! BULLETIN.


Why do they cry eo much, pa?” aeked the
editor’s little boy at the theatre, referring totheaotort
on the stage. “ Because they re# eo many dead-b&ad*
in the audience,” replied the editor, scowling at the
other newspaper man in the next row.
PEPPER AND SALT.
Up Northern Queensland way giddy publicans
are de rigueur. The other day, to the surprise of all,
one bonifaoo discarded a lady who had ruled the roast
far nine years, and hardly had the forlorn dame had
time to clear out with the blaokimith, than the deotor’s
parlour-maid was installed in the hotel. Two or three
days later this damsel retired Vlpshingly with the day’s
takings and the groom; on which tho publican proposed
marriage to the baker's sister. His otter being accepted
the breakfast was got ready, aud a parson chartered.
That holy man arriving, however, expressed a decided
opinion tbat ho had married tho lady before. She ad-
mitring the performance of tho ceremony, the parson
rode away. An awkward contretemps, you wMl say. Not
at all—in W.Q. The breakfast took place all the tame>
and the publican engaged the sister of the baker as bar
maid. But, then, it must be remembered that tho Hcdg-
kinion is—very near it.
So tho Marquis of Lome is to be raised to the
Peerage. Well, we don’t mind; nor do we wonder.
After the Duke of Connaught crusher, nothing about
royalty or thair entourage could cause us to gasp. The
idea seems to be that if Lome should die before bis
father, tho Princass Louise would only be a commoner.
If that be the case, where does royalty oome in ? The
fair Louise must then be only a Princess by courtesy.
Good. We like this. In addition to his Peerage, eto..
Lord Lome is also something in the army. He was
married in a dress which was vary much like tbat of
the Mayor’s orderly. The uniform is, we believe, tbat
of the Bug-a-bao Blusterers of the Argylo Militia.
They’ll make him, we suppose, a General now, too. or
assistant chair-wheelet in Colonel Leopold’s regiment.
Lord Lome’s marriage was a great lark. Everyb.dy
appeared to enjoy it but the bride. All sorts of jokes
were made about it, and one bearing upon tho Princess
well-known Barkisian character—being like the poor
carrier “ a trifle near"—us quite new. The bride and
bridegroom wore in the carriage in the Quadrangle at
Windsor-, the Queen was standing in tho doorway all
eady with one of the late Prince's shoes, the courtiers
were all gathered around with bags of rice, tho word
was given to start, when tho Princess suddenly cried
—“ Stop. Let me out. I’ve forgotten my little tin
lamp.”

” Tiger,” a black tracker of Roma, recently died,
and his gin, by way of carrying out an important fune-
ral rite, cat herself over the body with a tomahawk,
and also gashed her head. This is to express grief. Wc
have another way of doing that hero. It consists of
ordering a brand-new suit of olothei, purchasing a jet
watch gaard, aud chartering a procession, which is
twice as funny, but only half as clean, as a circus. Pip,
In “ Great Expectations,” is at his greatest when do-
scribing his sister’s funeral. Here is some of it: —
“ A sable warder (a carpenter who had onoe eaten two
geese for a wager) opened the door and showed me Into
the best parlour . . . where Mr. Trabb [the under-
taker] was holding a kind of black baz lar, . . . and
bad just finished putting someone's hat into black leug
clothes, like an African baby. . . . We wore all
going to ' follow,’ ani were in course of being tied up
by Trabb separately into ridiculous bundles
• Pookethandkerohiofs out all!’ cried Mr. Trabb . . .
in a depressed, buriness-liko voice—’Pockothand-
kerchiefs out I We are ready!’ So we all put our pocket-
handkerchiefs to onr faces, as if our nosos were
bleeding, and tiled out two-and-two. The remains of
my poor sister had been brought round to the kitchen
door, aud, it being a point of undertaking ceremony,
that six bearers must be stifl sd and blinded under a
horrible black velvet housing, with a white border, the
whole looked like a blind monster with twelve human
legs shuffling and blundering along under the guidance
of two keepers.** We have seen funerals quite as fumy
as this in Sydney, with the hearse-driver drunk, the
mourn ars hilarious aud t making; while others of them
read the paper and chewed tobacco. Were we not sash
a power in the country, we would ask that when we die
we belaid quietly away somewhere, without anyone
hiccupping regrets or belching forth a blessing over us.
But it will be with our distinguished selves, no doubt,
as it was with Charles Dickons and Qambetta. With
the simple difference, that here a grateful country will
insist upon burying us with great splendour— at our
own expense.

The Encampment is now over. The Rum man
has returned to his police-court, the “citizen-soldier”—
Alfred's Paladin—to his last, and the intelligent young
missionary, commissioned by the Herald, to Jeffario’
bosom. If only on account of the amusement which
this juvenile has caused us, wo are sorry that the en-
campment did not last for ever. Its breaking up, how-
ever, was imperative. Daring tho meeting of the war-
riors there was hardly any one to soil lollies in Paddy’s
Market; aud ail the men in tho tripe-shops were ama-
teurs of the milde&t calibre. In a liko manner with
tho pawnbrokers. None of them knew the old cus-
tomers of the shop, and much to our discomfiture our
waistcoat was a drug in the market. Weird women
took the places of men behind the counters of slop-
shops, and embarrassed the guileless rnstio in his orders
for underclothing of au unmentionable nature. The
familiar sights c£ civil servants lounging slowly
towards their offices with parcels under their arms,
which might have contained their washing, only
were too large and contained theif lunches, were
missed by the observant traveller; and females
affording sustenance to healthy infants, presided
at nearly all tho grocers’. The town, in short, was de-
serted. But in all this diffuses, the young man on the
Herald lit up (his world for us. He wan an ingenuous
eoribo, and though be might have known that, were
there no drunken men there’d be no policemen, he did
not apparently drop down to the circumstance that
were there no uniforms there would be no volunteers.
But if he was guileless, he wrote in a pleasant innocent
spirit, that strongly brought to our reco’loction the
essays we read long ago in our number two “ Aunt
Mavor*'—a work which contains a ten-line article in
monosyllables on a dog, the style of which we commend
to the serious consideration of tho gentlemen who
write the Rum editorials. We learn from onr contem-
porary that "at ten o’olooh the officers emerged (I)
from their tents, their uniform, brilliant with gold lace
and cording.” This is very great, indeed, and a*
once dispels the illusion that the warriors in quoj-
tion took the tented field in chintz bed-gowns.
The Governor, according to the report, appears to have
been more than usually facetious—saying that he had
"seen nothing better than tho manoeuvres since he was
in Germanya statement that might be regarded as a
Mahosder it emanating from a gentleman whoso soul
did not soar above the pursuit of Dorkings aud roosters.
Tho Herald young party apologises for a small error,
in which ho had put, on the day before, Captains Chap-
man aud Mackenzie in the defending instead of the
attacking force (I)—but, this being, of course, mere
detail, wa will not cavil at him. His Excellency, it
seems, considered the army 11 sturdy,” but that was
only afler seeing them put away poor Kidman’s beef;
but what Lord Loftus especially congratulated tho
warriors upon was—we quote him—"the immunity Of
our colony from warfare." There is a lot of real Hiber-
nian fun in this, but the Herald man couldn’t see it.
But funnier tfcan this, if possible, was a statement by
the Qovsrnor that “the Wolverene was a valuable
acquisition”—a humorous sally which possibly inspired
Mr, Stuart to remark later that he “ stood in the posi-
tion of Minister of War." Finally, wa learn that—and
who but a young man who had learned his strategy at
choir-practice could have written this ? . . . All the
ammunition wag expended, when the * Cease fire' was
sounded.” Thij is a fitting conclusion to a great
effort . Our curiosity being now aroused respecting the
author's talents, we should like to see some reflections
of his on the brain-makirg power of the muffin, or a
dissertation from his pen on tie moral effect of a kiss
behind the organ.

The St. Petersburg correspondent of the
Herald tells us several things,—many of which are of
special interest now tbat Alick is to be orowned. We
learn that tho Emperor has left his suburban tnnnel,
and “ is at the Anitchkin, Palace,”—whore he will pro-
bably remain till ho goes soaring in the direction of the
Bailie. The “common people " get drunk, we are told,
and fail down and freezs to death; and “the misery
amongst the poor is heartrending.” Yet the corona,
tion is to be “cn a scale of splendour never before
attempted ’’ (as ihe papers say), and some persona pre-
tend to suppose tbat Alexander is game to face the
common people, who fall down when they get drunk
and freeze. And what is not over re assuring for our
old pal is, that one Bogdanowitoh (deuce of a monniker
this I) engaged himself as an engineer at the Church of
the Kremlin, when it was discovered that his little
game was to burst the whole business up, j ust as they
were anointing Alexander with holy oil. Bogdano-
witch, by the way, once kept a cnee se-t hop in which
they used to mako dynamite grenades. They
captured the cheese-shop and the bombs, eto , but not
tho conspirators. Ever since this, when His Majesty
has taken a fa-cy for a bit of Cheshire, he has bad a
cow killed, and made all his body-guard dine off it. Ifl
a like manner, when the Imperial spirit has moved him
to savoury pie, he has—being sceptical about mixed
meats —Killed a oat in the coal-hole and made the pasts
himself. These are interesting little matters of his-
tory which only we can furnish. Though they may not
gain for us, in tho present decade, that admiration
which they should engender, our reward will be in the
dim future. We are patient. We can wait for it. At
present we shall be quite content if the gratitude of
our subscribers takes the form of groceries.
ABOUT KISSING.
There are some strange things in this world of ours;
One of the strangest this is.
That though there be laws for the lapse of hours,
And the flow of tides and the flash of flowers,
Aud a Jaw (see Wiggins) for storm and showers,
Thera isn’t a law for kisses.
We have laws to regulate night and day—
Laws wa coaid well stand missing
When the lights go out in the midst of play,

But there, we are getting a bit outre—
None to regulate kissing.

There are kiresa of all kinds, sh.rt and long

And as shallow as liurelleas Bladen’s soag;
And some of them right and soma of them wrang:
See passim tbit prime of the kissing t ir jag,

You remombar the kiss you gave yo it dear.
Luscious, and Lug, atd mellow —
A soft sweet kiss’, like a iotg rof e-j ear

Or else (we finish it no in a word)
A cross-bred, cross-eyed spaniel I
In onr opinion, whioh you’ll endorse,
These kisses got too historic
When you trace them from lap-dog to your lipa’ source;
Or, as but last week, on the Randwiok course.
Where you find girls fighting to kiss a horse,
Though the name of the horse was Warwick.
And, however the thing miy seem to you,

The News reports that a newly-arrived musical
critic (“of a contemporary "—hem i) in criticising
“ Stabat Mater," called it “ Starboard Martyr.” Well,
what of that ? We remember, don’t we, old hoy, when
in our youth, before we were managing proprietor of
even a coke-yard, that we went to a musical per-
formance acd wrote a graphic description of “The
Martha of Hollyoake," being especially eloquent on the
subject of a certain “hornet obligation." Then remem-
tar how we laughed at the librettist who couldn't spell
“Ada” in his opera without putting an “I” in it 1 Then
how we talked in the gloaming about Wagnor’s “Pars-
lev Palls," and how, in a critical notice on “The
Messiah,” you began—“Handle wrote this; also
‘ Mollic Darling,’ and the ‘Harp that Wonst;’" and
furthermore observed —“ The symbols took well, like-
wise the solos." Heigho I those were gay old critical

A “norriblo talc” comes from Sale, Gippsland,
where a very tnnoh-married man, possessed of a morbid
desire for novelty, invited a comely and muscular servant
girl to meet him in a secluded spot Just outside town.
But Susan wasn’t a girl of that sort j so, donning a suit
of male attire and providing heraelf with a stout whip,
she met her fond admirer, and, after accusing him of
asking to meet her sister clandestinely, she started tho
flogging with euoh a vim that, in two minutes, the old
baldhead was considering which part of his anatomy
needed most arnica.
Says the Echo There are said to be a
million office-holders in France, nearly every one of

not so many hare, because Ministers and Ministers’

service of ihe State. The feeling here, however, is dif-
ferent, anyhow—tho pnblio consider themselves entitled
to treat such as wa have with contempt. This is a very
deplorable s f gu of the growing irreverence of this coun-
try for hereditary imbeoility.

Combes and Alfred were on their way to the (

Charlie Roberts’s, Combes, who was on pictures intent, .

“ Oh, it’s a bilious thing, even with brandy. I used to j
take It after lunch,” proceeded Alf , “ butnow I go in for j

ceives the largo salary of A3 2s. 6d a week for the

•’cannot a competent man be got for Cooma at a simi-
lar figure?’ . . Well, we can’t be certain why ; but
it’s most likely because ihe editor of the Express,
who may be able to live luxuriously in the style Jie is
accustomed to on 13i. a week, would insist on thenom- 1
patent man, in addition to the work of clerk and sur-
veyor, acting also as town crier, public dustman, and

what perplexed, the virtuous lady hurried down, but
seeing the book in his hand, at onoo concluded, he was
the water pipe man, and said " Oh, yes, we did; but it
was such a little thing we didn’t ueed to call in any
outside help." Then he explained that he was the
‘census man, and said it didn’t matter how big it, was,
or whether they had any help, or . But we feel that
this is a matter that should not bo pursued farther. It

How da our Transit; Commissioners and '
"Cruelty to Animals” crowd spend their holidays? ■
Wa cnee heard a story about a costermonger who was I
enckavoxaiug to ecax an old orow-roost to haul Mmtelf j
and a select company of friends to the Eptono Derby, j
and being cautioned by his acquaintance that his moke ;
would never get br.lt the way, the cheerful coster \
promptly replied, "Voa’t 'e then—vy, there’s fourteen
on us hup ’ero, an’ we've all got chips." Something j
similar happens here on every holiday. Poor, emaciated I
hat-racks, that have to actually lean against a fonoe to j
cough, are harnessed up to parcel-carts as big as Noah’s
ark; and quite frequently these commodious vehicles
have to bo swept, end the paint scratched off their
sides, to make room for the inhuman load of sin that
crowds them. If a Sydney holiday horce ever er joys
the privilege onoo allowed to Balaam’s asp, he’ll roar
np on his heels and curse out Transit Commissioners
and constabulary “ fooroe," and the ancestors thereof,

This is really funny. An up-country school-
teacher, who wan deep into the books of the looal
tradesmen, got notice that he was about to be shifted •
bo, when they heard that, the various storekeepers’
publicans, etc., pat their heads together and resolved
to get up a testimonial. That was the only way they
could see of getting their Bug. back. Well, the purse
of sovereigns was duly collected and presented; and, as
it was known that the teacher had another week to rirn
tho minds of all were easy. Next morning the teacher
was not in when several inquiring friends called. All
that remained to perpetuate his memory was a pair of
boots and his compliments. Ho had procured a week’s
leave before the testimonial was mooted. After several
rounds of curses, tho publican was proceeding to fit on
the boots—a neat pair of oloth-tops—with some com.
pla oenoy, when tho organist looked in and claimed them
as his property. Then the publican went homo, packed
his sho n -trunk and loaded his mntkot. Further do-
v lopmi nD may therefore be shortly looked for.

That giddy old girl, “Phyllis” (not a neat,
handed Phyllis” by any means), who wears cow-hide
boots with the hair outside, and inks her thumbs writ-
ing somniferous nonsense for the Sydney Mail, has
been wrestling with a subject in which she has for the
last flfty.nine years taken a deep and personal interest
—via, “Why Sydney men don’t marry." After plea-
santly describing the average -Sydney bachelor cs a
cross between a native bear and a rosella parrot,
" Phyllis" rather naughtily observesHaving in
time past exhibited many social instincts, he now, as
the pairing season comes round, appears to be little in-
olined to mate." We candidly confess that w« really
never knew until “ Phyllis" told us, that April
Fools' Day, on which her article appeared, was the
commencement of the "pairing reason." Further
along this Mail female accounts for the repugnance
“Our Boys" have towards hooking on to “Our Girls 1 *
in the holy bands of padlock, by chaiitably remarking
that "possibly there may be in this enervating Sydney
beat seme deadening influence which blunts tho appe-
tite for considerate and unselfish action." There may
possibly bs some i light colour of foundation for
“ Phyllis’s " eolar theory, for did not Byron sing t—
" 'Tis a rad thing, I cannot choose but say.
And all the f%ult of that indecent run.
Who cannot leave alone our helpless day,
Bat will keep baking, broiling, burning on.
That, howsoever people fast and pray,
The flesh is frail, and so the soul undone;
What men call gallantry, and gods adultery.
Is CLuoh more common where the climate’s sultry."
Here we have a most, decided conflict of opinion on the
question of solar influence and the matrimonial ques-
tion, between the Mail Minsrva and the shirt-collar
poet, Byron ; but it is explained by the fact that the
la’ter used to warm up bis muse with gin, whereas
“Phyllis" keep? hers at n eatfroesdng room tempera,
ture with ice cream and raspberry balm, and a stick in
it. As’.n parting shot, “ Phyllis" declares: “You may
see this proceeding constantly in our midst, a man
running after a wealthy girl or a widow. Which of
tinea men is there who would net eoll bis liberty in
exchange for his beard and lodging ? " But, “ Phyllis,'*

or a high kicking but pious ballet queen, who didn’t

tiope, and metaphor—Mr. Copeland’s explanation can.
net but be deemed perfectly satisfactory, whereas Mr.
Baker’a certainly was not; tbe virtue of the House at
That time being of a very severe nature When Mr.
Copeland attributed his comparative failure as au
t rator at the St. Patrick’s Bar qnet to dyspepsia, every.
• re was perfectly satisfied. The hen gentleman, with
lidicglous frankness, said something about "three
glasses of brandy on an emp*y stomach," but no one
paid any attention to that, Mr Copeland evidently
wished to oonoeal nothing, probably delighting to say
with M. Blandoia, " I am trank. Frankness is part of
my character." Dyspepsia, then, was at once accepted j
and wo ourselves can endorse the effect of that malady
not only upon powers of speech, but of locomotion Last
time we were dywpeptio was at the races It affected
our eye eight at that time, and the effect of the horses
as they went round was kaleidosoop o. Feeling uncom-
fortable, as we had to furnish a report for a religions
paper, wo went down into the luncheon-room, when we
discovered a gentleman similarly afflicted, who was
possessed of an idea that the caterer wns his annt On
another occasion, at a wedding-breakfast, we got the
malady " very bad.” It was our dnty to return thanks
for the bridesmaids; and, though thedyspep ia affected
our recollection te the extent of onr remembering very
little about what occurred (except that there f earned
to be about forty brides at, one wedding), we are
reported to have uttered these wirds: "Misuber
Funsh,—I'm oandidash for Shoush S lydnesh (/tic). Or
ri,” when wo were tenderly carried home on a shutter.
The only difference between onr m- laiy, on thee a c ces-
sions, and Mr Copeland's eecm< tnat, while he took
something when he was empty, wo tmk something
when we wore full. Dvspapsio, iide<d, seems to be
spreading in Sydney, Yon cm bus men, lying under
trees inthe Park, vary bad with the aalady at all hours:
and it is not so long ago that we saw an ancient M P.
so atUietod with the fell dis-a-o that ho was doubled
up like a pocket-knife, lie was supported up-stairs to a
bedroom in the full blaze of noon-day j and when there
his dyspepsia took the form of putting his boots out-
side the ooor, being under the impression that it was
the middle of the night, and of calling over the balusters
—*‘ Waltersh, bringst upsh another bottle Pipsrsheok.”
A variety of cures have been put forward for this dis-
tressing malady. They vary from soda-water and a
cinder to devilled bones. Some people, it is true, advo-
cate a weak solution of mnstard.warin, while most of
the authorities incline, we believe, to balmy slumber.
With regard to Mr. Copeland's experiment of a banquet,
we think it must, on the whole, be written down a
failure. By the way, he didn't tell us what brought the
dyspepsia on It couldn't have been the brandy, so it
must nave been the Art Gallery!

polioe summoned him, bat as there was some slight
error in the document as regards bis name, Toal
neglected to appear. Then the minions of the law
called him out of bed at near midnight, took him to the
lookup like aonuinou criminal, sad bail to the amount
of £50 being offered and refused, be, was looked up all
night, while bis wife was in agony and suspense. Next
day the ease wav dismissed, but costs were not allowed.
Toal now taints himself much injured, and ia making a
howl in the papers.
More trouble. Here, now, Miss Mary Beattie,
who knew a jeweller in Greenock, and, as she admits in
her evidence that she •* walked out with him at night”
(a Scoteh term that we don't understand), comes out to
join hiei in Rockhampton. She came oat at the expense
of an indulgent Government, and joined her lover
accordingly. Ho asked her to tea, with her sister.
After this, the again “ went oat walking.” Then, laier
on Miss B. sues her swain for the maintenance of a
“little stranger.” Ihe defendant's solicitor ask, some
questions about David Dourvad and James M'Field.

J" imy Young, the Amidale Chinese doctor,
wat, it is clear, murdered for hie money. Yet on his
body were found fourteen £1 notes and one sovereign,
together with a watch and chain. This brings to mind
an incident of the horrible Parramatta Biver murders
la the ease of Walker, the hypothesis of murder for
money was tor a time upset by the fact that several
gold coins were found on the body of the deceased
man. Both Nichols and Lester, in the'r confessions,
stated that after the deed was done they were seized
with a fear so terrible that they couldn't master
strength enough to search the dead man's pockets.
Mrs. Dwyer—the lady who resolved, the other
day, at a country police court, to *• take it out" in gaol
“rather than pay £30.'* for dy-grog-selling— had what

quented the busiest public roads—which probably ex*

The Victorian Government, in view of mining
catastrophes, &o., have ordered a Flense patent com*
bined.diving and noxious gas apparatus. The patent,
which is self-contained and wholly independent of the
surrounding atmosphere, will supply breathable air for
four house at a time; thus enabling the wearer to
breathe with safety in the most deadly gases, and to
explore the most intricate turnings of a mine or born,
isg building. The principle is that the wearer breathes
his own breath over and over again. The carbonic atid
being absorbed from it at each expiration, and the re-
quisite amount of oxygen restored, the revivified breath
is fit to be again inhaled in the form of pure air.
The Free Lance says : “ Years ago in these
columns have we denounced Ooed Templar lodges as
the most fruitful source of vice, resorted toby the most
depraved and vicious of men, places where lastful
appetites could be gratified to the fullest extent, easily
and cheaply. Servant girls of a certain stamp nsed not
to be content with belonging to one lodge, bat had a
great idea of visiting country lodges, and getting home
“ with the milk in the morning." The mistresses who
suffered from these pranks soon got tired of the game,
and a girl applying for a situation had only to say she
was a Good Templar to be at once declined with thanks.
■ ;t the history of Auckland street girls wore known, it
would be found that four out of bve made their first
step from virtue at a O.T. lodge, and it is high time
that the ungodly institution was swept off the face of
the earth.” As teetotal bodies they are a diffusion and
a snare.
The other day the Wild River (N Q.) miners
rolled up to interview Mr. W. Stevenson, the local
manager of the Q N. Bank, to ask him to discharge
from bis service his Chinese o 'ok—the idea being that
if Mr. Stevenson retained the Asiatic others would
follow suit, and Chinese cooks would be general Mr.
Stevenson said he had nothing to do with others;
be wanted a servant; ho conid procure no other than a
wall-recommended Chinaman, and the law did not
oppose the engagement; he, therefore, declined to
discharge him until he could Had a suitable substitute.
Whereupon the miners resolved to "boycott” the
bank and any storekeeper who dealt with it. Beyond
talk, the demonstration on caoh side was perfectly
orderly.
Railway accident compensation-hunting is now

commodating. He received slight injuries to bis back,
bat was not going to tbe trouble of law over (he matter.
He'd accept whatever was thought fair. It was, 1 1

Mr. Anthony Willows, M.R.C’ V.S , suggests
that, by way of experiment, a colony of rabbits be ino-
culate! with the virps of tuberculosis, to which disease
the rodent is peculiarly susceptible Mr, Willows
asserts that the infectious and contagious properties of
the virus would, in a very short time, lerult in the total
extermination of bonny, who, after being eo inoculated,
couldn’t, of course, be used tor food—tuberculosis being
equivalent to the disease known as consumption, and
various other things. Mr. Willows cays he has, on tbe
only two occasions ha visited Homebush rale-yards,
seen cattle suffering from tuberculosis. Apropos, some
years ago a Colao (Vie.) rquatter inoculated some of
the rabbits on his rnn, not with tulcrculoFis, but with
syphilis, but the result appears so have boon nil. Any.
how, the rabbits still live, ar.d people «at them.
When, in tho Tamworth Council, it was pro-
posed to vote a eum not exceeding £20 to defray the
expenses of sendingthe local fire brigade to Melbourne,
Alderman Vott enthusiastically moved that tbe amount
be mtide £lo€0, to enable the men to visit Europe and
America: also that £2C00 be voted to Alderman Dowel
to travel with the* men for the purpose ef exhibiting
what Tamwoith could produce in the way of a glorious
flee brigade; and, further, that Alderman Dowel be
authorised to expend £5000 in buildings to be set on
Are in order to give the Tamwerth heroes a chance of
spreading themselves and “sloshing around” with
tneir new '.xtirguicheis. Vett was about to add tbe
Counoil would dow.well to start Dowel’s brigade before
tbe full moon, bat happening to notice that a brother
alderman was gesticulating wildly with the leg of a
chair, ha very widely sat down, and said he thovght

tion.
Perhaps the most ludicrous clause in the
Licensing Act is the one which allows “stuff” to be
oarried out of an hotel on certain days, tut does not
allow it to be drunk on the premises. The effect of
this section on Good Friday, was very funny. All down
Lower George-street, burly sailors were either sitting
on forms ontside pubs., or leaning against posts, quaf-
flag huge goblets of a speo’es of rum which would, in
a sufficient quantity, incite the mildest-mannered
curate to murder in the first degree. One man pur-
chased at a pub., near tbe dead-house, a bottle of Irish
whisky, and,- having filled a billy with water, sat down
on a doorstep and drank the lot. He then greatly en-
tertained the ralgbbourhood by walking on all-fours
and barking like a dog ; a feat which he varied by other
vagaries of an equally eccentric nature. After he had
broken three windows, lamed a horse, and killed a goat,
tbe constabulary arrived, and he was conducted to the
lot k up. In tho morning he pleaded—” Dishpepshnr”

Dingoes are fast being cleared out of the Tnmut
district. This is good news tor tbe shot powueia It la
al o good news (or the man who likea to tee the country
overrun by labblts All down ah ng tho Southern
bordrr of N H W., where a work of extermination has
been carried on against the dingo, the Equatter and
selector have anino unparably worse enemy to deal with
in the shape of millions of rabbits. It is a strange
thing, too, that the destruction of the native cat is fol-
lowed by a plague of rabbits. Proof of this ia near at
band in the Central Cumberland district There some
of the landowners have been paying largely for the
heads of native cats—now they're (arced to pay (or the
tails of rabbits. Tho properties where the native oat
has been designedly protected by tbe owners (one of
them is Ur. S. H. Terry) are wholly free from the rabbit
nuisance. Tbe gentleman just mentioned stated in lbs
Legislative Council recently that he believed a sui-
cidal coarse was being pursued in exterminating the
natnral enemies of rabbits and marsupials. By the
way, oae native oat has been known to kill seven rabbits
in one night.
Whqp Carey, the informer, was reciting in court
the story of the Phoenix Park murders, Brady, who
appears to have killed both men, "cowered behind
M‘Cattery (another of the accused) in tbe comer of the
dock, his face pale as marble, and glossy with perspira-
tion At times he covered it with his hands, which
rested on U'Caffety's shoulder; then suddenly raising
it, ha glared with an angry flash in bis largo fierce eves
upon the witness.” One of the most shocking incidents
of the proceedings was when Delaney, convicted of
attempting tbe life of Judge Lawsou, came forward,
pale, emaciated, and almost at tho point of death.
Raising and pointing his fingers at Carey, ho said in a
hollow voice, “There’s the man I may thank for my
whole mis;ortnnesinlife from childhood up ” According
to Corey, Brady gave him tbe following account of the
assassinations" I put my hand upon Burke's left
shoulder and stabbed him. While doing so the other
gentleman struck me in the face with bis umbrella, aud
said, ’ Oh, you ruffian.’ With that I gotl annoyed aud
excited, and I followed him. He pnt up bis am, and I
struck him on the arm He went out on the road. I
settled him there. I looked round aud I saw Tim Kelly
at Burke. I went buck myself and out Mr. Burke’s
throat.” While Carey told his story, an awful silence
prevailed in Court Tbe prisoners, who could best
apprehend the graphic fidelity of the picture which he
drew, leaned forward in the dock, and listened with
eager interest.
Later accounts show that Desailly (a New
South Wales native), who was speared to death at
Monnt Mulligan. Hodgkinson, N Q , met his fate while
chasing blacks. His horse was found tied to a tree—his
body was in one cf those narrow, rongh gorges runnirff
into the heart of Mount Mulligan On each aide cf the
gorge rose up steep masses of rook, and large pieces of
rook and heavy bonlders interspersed the bottom of
the gorge, and rendered it difficult to walk except by
jumping from one rock to another. On one of those
fiat pieces of rook, about five or six feet high, lay tie
missing man. He was lying full length on bis cheat, with
hfc hands stretched out ia (rent. Between his bands
was his revolver tightly clenched; the revolver was
pointed into the gorge, and it was evident that the pocr
fellow had not muoh time to nse it as five ohamursont
of tbe six were loaded Two barbed spears wore fixed
through his body, which the blacks had not touched—
probably they were not certain that ho was dead when
he (ell, and were too frightened to come within
range of the pistol he held menacingly in his band.
His coat was found a few yards distant, and it
was evident that ho bad flung it off so as not to im-
pede his escape. It is evident that he dismounted,
because the way was too rough for bis horse, and
then, revolver in nand, ented the gorges of Mount
Mulligan. He proceeded to the blaoks' camp, and
there (as tbe blood-tracks show) received one of tbe
spears. Afiaid that be might be overcome by numbers
he hastened to retreat, and was within about a mile and
a half of his hotse when be met his fate. There was
only one chamber of his revolver discharged, but it is
surmised that he fired several rounds and loaded again*
as ho had only a few cartridges leit when found. Tbe
five chambers which were loaded were all right, as Mr.
Middlemisa, who found the body, in order to sea
whether the pistol hung fire, discharged it next day,
and it went eff all right. Desailly was buried ip the
| valley.

Saddleback Mountains the hon. member has 510 acres
under tho Mineral regulations, and C. W. Licoy has
530, and J. W. Caird 440, and J. W. May has 120 acres.
And the Mayor of Kiama hints that Tarrant and L '.coy
and Caird and May are very much alike, (specially the
doctor. And it is said that tho mineral (.elections have
no mineral deposits, and arc not likely to have any,
unless the railway “metals" bo laid on their surface,
when these remarkable mines may be expected to pay
very handsomely. *nd JVha Davies, C.M G. —who
hates anything like dishonesty and doesn’t believe in
underground engineering, especially with respect, to
mineral selections which contain no metals—is smelling
round Tarrant’s seat. Which is just tho sort of ooeupa-
tion for which John Davies is fitted by nature and dis-
position.
NOW, CHARLEY 1
We’ve heard so much of eloquence
That on us palls—
Stuff with nor reason, rhyme, nor sense.
Dull shallow alteration, hence

Come. Lord of Chat a worth, lot us hear,
With beating hearts,

That voice to Darling Point so dear ;—
And guaga thy parts.
A champion of the vinous trade,
Shico in thy place;
Or stay—aommaud and be obeyed !—•

We'll ‘ state a case "
We have a magic touch, you know;
All legislators say ’i is so;
This we're great in;
Our service wo proffer, lo.
We are —now cry it is “a go"-—
A first-class I>jinn,
When people feel inclined to bo glib about Irish
outrages, and don't know exactly how to ohoosa their
language, they might repeat the following, which we
q icfce from an Adelaide paper:— * In the earlier part, of
5803, Sir W. H ircourt (wss he not Secretary for Ire-
land ?) a number of tho English G vernmwut, stated in
his place >n tho House of Commons that the evictions
were proceeding at the rate of a thousand a day, and
flint every su;h eviction was a deliberate murder. He
pathetically implored every I>i-h landlord t> refrain
from pursuing those eviotiors but his appeal was
ignored; and it h vs afford'd tho opportunity of saying
that, England stands alono among civilized rations in
the proud position of awarding capital punishment for
the non payment ef a simple sum of eny £5 13s. 4d. 1
Tboro can bo no doubt wha ever that it these eviotim
scenes were attempted to bo perpetrated in the com-
paratively uncivilized natio is of France, Oirmany. and
Aua’ria, tho strong arm < t tins Government would be
interposed, not, as with the English, on behalf of the
landlords, but on brhalf rf the people who wore being
cruelly and slowly done lo death by the landlords, backed
by tho military, the jolio', and government prisons 1"
Mora plain English by a correspondent :—
*' * Loyalty to the Throne,’ ’Loyalty to the Constitu-
tion and institutions of Qrea 1 - Britain,’ 'Loyalty to
the integrity of the Empire,’ era stock phrases of the
privileged and plutocratic classes, and as much a dis-
guise cf fraumlent intention and purposes as are the
stock headings of some advertisements Ouch * loyalty.’
w th its effusive reverence for ‘Iiw and order,’ its
her.or of ’asm-sina*ion’— while the Juggernaut cf a
monarchical and aristocratic system it worships is
daily doing to death thousands cf people, a »d degrad-
ing hundreds of thousands more to a hapless, hopeless,
and helpless serfdom—is treason to fho people, u libel
upon civilization nud Christianity, and a fraud upon
society. It is with (he preaching of this sort of
■loyalty’ ttat the plutocratic class and anti-Irish
crusade, from press and platform (at home and bote),
hope to stifle a 1 efforts for the rofo m of abuses, and a
concession of that self-government to Ireland which is
< nj }yed iu the colonies. • Loyalty to the Throne * and
’the Unity of tho Empire* are tho la. o excuses for
ooero'ng Ireland to a submission to i jo-tioe, and to
forfeit its right to the free institutions and representa-
tive self government that have been so long conceded
to this and other parts of the Empire."
Lvst week Melbourne Punch came out with
aoartcoa—evidently designed' dull i* th<> firt e x Pc-
ment caused by the absurd wire ve tho ’• Fenian a'tack
cu Lvly Florence Dixie." Meibourne Pum;h is
nothing if tot wildly anti democratic aad fu i usly
anti-Irish The artist has drawn a figure (alter Du
Manrior) of a woman, behind whom stilk cowhed ard
scowling assassins ohrehiog daggers, the noiots
whereof have been turned bv her clothing. Punch
be’i -ved it all, at first—swallowed the woman's
cock-and-bull lie like its matutinal rum and milk ;
and then, wh'=n it discovered ,tbat it bsd fallen into a
pit, proceeded vo try and turn off the whole affair os a
joke— as though It had never believed Lady Florence
for an instant, you know. Melbourne Punch is, and
has ever been, n can and drivelling, and blind as a t wo-
rt iy-o!d puppy It has neither the percejtion to Ois-
cern, nor tho courage to fight, for an unpopular though
righteous cause. Not a single evidence of literary
ability is over traceable in its pages. It would die
to morrow but for an aitist, whose pencil, albeit grace-
ful, is utterly destitute of originality. AH the reforms
in Victoria —and there have been sweeping reforms iu
the Southern colour—have been effected in the face of
the snarls of Melbourne Punch, which docs not hold
one single political opinion in accord with the sent'-
incuts of the great masses of the Victorian people.
The following is tho gist of tho speech by Mr.
O’Donnell, M.P., at a public meeting, presided over by
Mr. Justin M'Carthy, M.P., to consider tho famine in
Ireland, to which tho Lord Mayor of London rofenoi
as abusive, and as jastifiiug him in refusing to invite
subtorintioms for the relief of the famishing people : —
Mr. O’Donnell “ was glad to hoar that it was intended
to invoke the assistance of the Lord Mayor of London,
wh • was at tho bead of a corporation which every year
drtw from tho mismanag'd estates of confiscated Ulster
thousands and tons of th usands of money. Not a
penny of all the millions thus stolen from Ireland wr.s
ever reatond to the lawful owners Ho trusted the
appeal to the prorent Lord Mayor weuld be successful,
and that he would bf) as anxious to keep the roofs over
the poor tenantry of Ireland as one of bis predecessors
showed himsolf eager to pull down those roofs when he
gave hia patronage to a to-called Property Defercj
Fund. He was sorry to find to few Englishman pre-
sent. An English Prince had taken bis title from ihe
province most racked by distress. Would ihe Duke cf
Consaught then, before tha proceedings dosed, appear
on tho platform to support the chairman on behalf of
the distressed of Ireland ? Where w-re all the swarms
of English peers a’nd commoners who drew large rent-
rolls fro u those starving popuktioas ? In thdr ab-
sence, he appealed to common humanity." One would
have thought that such utterances—obviously true—
would have movel the implicated parties to shame and
remorse, and made them eager to oommeuce the work
of reparation Instead of this, it only seems to have
tflecu-d the Mayor as Moses' appeals attested Pharoab
—hardened his heart
The dish t ea in Ireland is now attributed —and
probably truly—to people attempting to live on ex-
iremely email holdings •’ Attempting " ia not Hie
right woid ; ’’’ rndesvouriyg ” better carries the eeni;e.
Iu is not as if (.he people took small holdings from
choice, ond had entered upon a voluntary experiment.
T hey woull prefer large holdings if they could get
them. And, in fact, the remedy proposed by the govern-
ing classes is really to shift the people to where they
can get large holdings—as Canada. Emigration is the
recognised remedy; but emigration out of Ireland.
This gives ca Australians tho case ia a nutshell. Why
not (migration to another part of Ireland—nay, to
another pait of the very province in which the people
arestaiviig? Or, to come still mater, why not omi-
gration over the nearest store fence on the larger
holdings at present sacred to sheep and cattle?
The answer teems to be that sheep aad cattle
pay better, just as iu the Highlands of Boot,
laud. Ireland is not overpopulated. Michael
Davitt has just been cast into prison for reuoinmeudiug
the people who are starving on small holdings to move
down iu their thousands aud take possession of the
rich grazing land of other counties. The strange thing
ia that there should have boon any opening ter such a
suggestion. Why, in tha name of humanity, are not
tho people of Ireland invited to take larger holdings in
their own country, since these arc available, and it has
bean agreed that tho small holdings are the cause of
tho famine which scourges them p The man who per-
mits his fellow creatures t® perish by withholding his
owa superfluity of land is as much a murderer as the
man, full fed, who, having a supeiUnity of loaves, tucls
i hem under his arm, and lets a famishing creature
perish of hanger under his eyes.
Here is a clincher lor tho Australasian. The
Hon. Dr. O'Dcheity, M.L.C. of Q iceusland, at the
Brisbane 8t. Patrick’s banquet, mace some romaiks so
peitinent to tbe relations of Itkhuuu with Englishmen
that they arc deserving of particukr attention Dr.
O'Doheity. speaking from the chair at the banquet
said :—“Would to God tbe rulera of tho great British
E npiro at homo c< nld see Q reciieland as it had been
for tbe last fjur or five years, and before that tine
They would see tha Irish race in its prep r colours.
Tney wou'd tee a Government in power, two members
of which wore thorough representatives of tho race that
could hold thn reins of power—two gentlemen of I hair
own creed. Tho Hon. John Macrostan and tho Hon.
Patrick Pork ins found themselves wor king with Sir
Thomas MM wraith, and tho Hon. A. Archer, ns
slerliug a pair of Scotchmen as ever steed on
Queentdaud soil; a New South Wales man, tho
Hon. Boyd Moral.ond ; and a native of tha colony, tha
Attorney-General. That Ministry was as thoroughly
representative as he had over scon in tho colony, and
its existence for four or five years he regsidtd as an
evidence that if they only had fair play the Irish wire
iu perfect harmony with the other great branches of
the Empire." With reference to these remarks, tho
Australasian, a vehemently Tory organ, suggests that
it would have been well had tho hon. gentleman inked
his compatriots how this condition of things had come
about. Tho Australasian obligingly proceeds to
supply the information in its own fashi n. Had Ihe
Tory writer been at tho pains to fully iaferm himself on
tho theme he wrote about, he might have spared him-
self tho trouble of speaking for Australian Irishmen, and
especially cf dribbling out such puerilities as that tbeir
contentment is “not reached by any stump oratory on
tho wrongs of Ireland, by singing ‘The Wearing cf the
Green,’ by kinking the Harp of Erin, by recapitulating
and recriminating over the old matters iu dispute be-
tween Ireland and the rest of ihe Empire." Nobody had
ever sard it was. Bn' the absurdity of the t ustbai Asian’s
expression of regret that Dr. O’Doborty had nut asked
his compatriots a series of political conundrums is
made obvious by the circumstance that ihe worthy
doctor had in tbe interim rend to Mr. Redmond an
nddrees of welcome iu which the desired information is
fully embodied. “ We are loyal aud contenUd in Aus-
tralia, because we have no reason lo be othoiwite.”
Those are the actual words of the Iri-h colonists of
Queensland. Very short, very simple, yet very con-
vincing tird comprehensive. It is ioditativo cf tho
innsranco with which the Australasian writer ad-
dresaed himseif to his subject that be waa Obviously
unaware that tho Hon. Dr. O'Doherty—a man
and respected by all conditions of people iu Queensland,
snd known to be orderly and loyal to the institutions
under which ha lives as man can bf—was himself while
a you'h tiam ported to these colonies as a political
prisoner, convicted of the offeree of having written a
‘‘disloyal" article in tbe Dublin Nation. The Austral-
astan merits thanks for !■ aving elicited evidence so con-
c naive tbat an It Unman is loyal and law-abiding in those
colonies, and disloyal and recalcitrant in Ireland, for
tha simple retain that he enjoys Constitutional Gov. ra-
ment and civil fietdom her-, whereas in Ireland le is
an bj acted to despotic rule , ni deprivation of all rights
whatever.

HOW HE LOST,
We met a friend who’d lost a pile
Upon the course last week;
He wore a very woeful smile,
Nor seemed inclined to speak
At large, upon the way in which
He did the crafty “ ring ” enrich.
Said we : "Ah, well, this was a frost,
III.lack it was, of course ?”
Said he: ** Ill-luck be d d ; I lost
Through backing the best horse."
" What mean you ? Sure this is but fun ?’*
" Just this ; The best horse didn't run ”
For reasons.

Thus “Atlas”: — “Now that tha Princess of
Wales has put her Boyol veto on pigeon-shooting, the
presslias discovered a wonderful unanimity in agreeing
that a terra-ootta dish, sprung into the air, is, it any.
thing, an improvement upon Nature herself, as repre-
sented by a blue reck. ®ne can be a tender lover of
animals, and yet penetrate the sophistry of those who
argue that slaughtering animals in their own natural
haunts is not cruelty, but that killing them out of traps
is. Sporb and fair play demand that the animal shall
have a fair chance for its life; and nothing is more re-
volting than seeing weakly animals sacrificed. Thus
much it is necessary to say to avoid being classed
amongst the brute beasts, preparatory to remarking
that it is difficult to discern how wounding unfortunate
rabbits, which just manage to crawl to their holes to
die lingering deaths, or murdering pheasants wholesale,
which come confidingly to the call like domestic fowls,
can be considered as humane practices, and distinct
from trap-shogtiug on the score of cruelty. Tha hu-
manitarlau sophists speak at though the hare and the
partridge fully acquiesced in the arrangement, and did
not feel the pangs of death because oaught or shot in
the open. From the bird’s point of view it is highly
probable that tha gradual extermination of a covey
with the aid of dogs must be the utmost refinement of
cruelty for the latest survivors. Ask the inmate of the
condemned cell what he thinks about it I”
From London Bell’s Life, 27th Jan. At Not-
tingham, Charles Brown, of Peekham, alias "Young
Nimrod,” a remarkably good-looking boy, just tamed
eight years of age, standing scarcely 4ft. high, and
weighing 4st, was backed by his father to kill, at 18
yards rise, 70 pigeons out of 100, from throe trap?, five
yards apart, 80 yards boundary, with a double 28.boro
gun, the use of both barrels, charge of powder Ifc drams
and shot tho fifth of an ounce. The pigeons 4 applied
for tho match were tho beat blue rooks, and they went
from the traps at a terrific pace. Tno wind was far
from favourable, and it was so cold that the child said
at times he could scarcely feel the triggers of his mite
of a gun. The youngster, who appeared in blooming
health, commenced in grand style by stopping his first
font birds, but the fifth, though hit hard, fell out of
bounds. The sixth fell to the first barrel, but tho
seventh osoap d. He then, to tha astonishment of the
whole company, cleverly brought down eleven fast birds
without a miss, when 100 to 30 was freely offered on the
accomplishment of the task. From this point of the
contest be kept briskly at work, and killed 20 out of tho
first 25, 34 out of 50, 53 out of 75, and by tumbling over
17 out of the last 25 birds, bo was proclaimed the winner
amidst great oheoring, having brought down 70 out of
100 fast birds. Tho performance must bo deemed the
Sreatest on record by any juvenile shot; in fact. Master
Irown is the youngest pigeon shot that ever faced a
trap.

sculls, only Messrs. Johnson and Kloster showed up,

Rosetta finished a long way ahead of the other boats,
tha Velox beating the St. Crispin by a few lengths for

That John Brown ia dead will take time for ns to
realise. For some twenty years or so bis name has
been always before the public. The once popular
London periodical. The Tomahawk published a cir-
toon of him as “ The Shadow of the Throne," in which
he was represented, as in shadowy form, standing
behind the Queen’s chair. There was nothing shadowy,
however, about John Brown. He was about as sub-
stantial a man to look at os one could well see, and
they don’t make them much more so. Ho looked likely
to live to old age, and he has gone in middle life, lice
his master, Prinoe Albert. The telegraph tells ru not
enough, and the world will be wanting to know if death
was occasioned by similar causes.
Strange, indeed, that within one generation the plain
name ot "John Brown" should have rattled like a
dog-ohaiu through both Great Britain and America.
The reverberations have been thence heard throughout
tho world. While the one has been " marching on "
ia the spiritual sense, the other has been doing so i:
itie fleshly one. The spirit ot the American Brown ba i
long been celebrated in song—that song which Bury
Cornwall tells us sets the seal to all that Is grea’, and
good. The poets will now be busy enough with tka
British Brown, and time will show which of tha Iw >
will eolipe the other.
A great theme indeed for the wits and witlings of
Britain will be the lately-deceased Brown I By this
time epitaphs by the hundred, if not by tho thousand,
have been written, read, and recited, and not a fsw of
them posted to his bereaved Royal mistress. P >et<
seeking fame or favour will doubtlessly send monudies,
dirges, and requie-ns in his memory, nud these will go
to tha Royal mistress, and not to the widow Brown, t >
whom not one in a thou land will give a thought.
These will make a literaturs of the anprinlo 1 kind, un 1
therefore all the more precious in its unpublished ata:e
—something like what wo have heard, bat never read,
of the imitations of Lear’s nursery rhynus, and those
poetical efforts that obtained so much verbal circula-
tion on the marriages of the Royal princesses.
Aud yet what a volume these poetical epitaphs and
like souvenirs would make? The famous "R»j60tel
Addresses ” would be but small-beer com pared to them
The royal official’s notes, acknowledging the receipt of
many of them on behalf ot Brown’s bereaved mistress,
might also be published. They wo Hid serve to show in
what spirit they were received, and what, if any, tokens
of favour wore shown to their writers
Wo saw John Brown twice only—onea at Balmoral
and once in Loudon, On each occasion ha were High-
land costume, to which, wo believe, he always adhered.
On his appearing so attired at Windsor Castle, when
first promoted to his late office, the lord-iu-waiting was
reported to have expostulated with him, probably on
behalf ot the ladies to whom his balf-dcossed state
might not have been pleasing. It was then that I B.
began those replies that showed ho# little he oared tor
any opinion beyond that of bis Royal mistress. Through
the length and breadth of the land it was reported—and
published in all the papers—that Brown had told the
lord-in-waiting that " the Quean likes mo best without
my breeches."
From her fondness for everything that was of the
Highlands, it is probable that his Royal mistress liked
Brown best in the costume in which she first saw him.
Whatever it was about him that so impressed itself ia
bis favour, whe shall say P She said that it waa in
honour and memory ot her deceased Consort that she
made so mush ot Brown, who now became her body
servant or personal attendant—attending her daily and
sleeping in an aute-ohambor to the Royal apartmairt
nightly. It is well known how anything that reminded
Brown’s Royal mistress of her lost husband endeared
itself to one who so much missed him, Heneo the
favour shown to one whom she said that Prinoe Albers
had so much liked.
Brown had been long in this state of honours 1
aud happy servitude before tho world hoard of his
wedding. Surprisingly little was ever heard of his wife,
and nothing of any family that he had. His wife, it is
believed, saw but as little of him as does the wife ot a
whaler. She was solaced for such apparent neglect py
knowing how much else he had to look after, aud what
his duties wore elsewhere. It was comforting, no
doubt, to her to know that he was well employed, and
that she always knew how and whore to find him.
" Why should I weep for my deceased husband P " sain
a lately made widow; "I know where he spends his
nights now, which I seldom did while ha lived." No
ignorance such as that oould have troubled the peace of
mind ot Mrs. Brown. Her second husband, should she
marry again, will doubtlessly not ba reminded mujl:
about tho late deceased.
No visitor to Windsor and its apartments but were
shown tho royal chambef and that anto-ohambor in
which the faithful body servitor and personal attendant
slept. Lately we have read how his blunt replies to
some titled ladies much displeased them, and how their
complaints were carried in vain to Brown’s mistress.
"He called them women—did hoP" she said; "aud
what were they ? " It ia well we know, aud practice as
much as possible, to call a spade a spade; and that is
The Bulletin’s principle, and that by which it has
thriven and hopes to thrive. Wo are glad that wo have
Royal warrantry for plain speaking, and hope to have
the pat on the head for it that John Brown and
his bluntuess so often got.
Her Majesty’s fondness for living in the Highlands
was misunderstood for a long time, bat is well under-
stood now. She liked the customs of the country—and
its people. The seclusion of Balmoral also, and the air
aud exorcise she got there, were to her taste. She is, it
will be remembered, of the Guelph family, who have
never been of msthetio tendencies, always preferring tl a
"roses and the raptures" to tha “ languor and lilies"
of life. But a year or so ago Brown’s Royal mistress
attended his mother’s funeral, and now the sad time has
come that she must attend his also. Such is life both
high and low I
It is not notified that the court will go into mournii g
for this death in the Royal family, buc something win
likely be done in that way. Meantime curiosity will ha
asking who will be J. B's. suoo. sior P That there is a
billet now for somebody is boyund doubt or question,
and many an application has doubtless before this bet n
made for J B’s. berth —notwithstanding his fate avd
that of his former Royal master.
Meanwhile we want only tha volume of veras that
oould ba collected in memory of the departed one
Tennyson’s •• la Memoriam" would to as nothing in
popularity to it I The occasion for it is ampl i enough,
and tho material plentiful. Never will man’s memory be

Saturday saw another fine attendance at Band*
wick, and tuero were either hotter dresses, or they wore
better shown ; at any rate, there was more to interest
and note on tnolaWn than on the three preceding days.
It would be hard to describe them all, even had w a
epaoe { and it would need one who could fix the myriad
wriouj hnea of the changing chameleon to name all
the colours seen—the creams that grew warm till they
merged into a blushing pink, the pinks that deepened
into purple or flame, the browns that ran from lightest
fawn to the sombre shades of deep Vandyke, and the
prismatic sheen of the peacock hue*, “whoie like a
shoaling sea, the lovely blue played into green." And
fabrics, too, were very varied j summer is scarcely over,
and autumn hardly come, so from the airy muslin to
velvet, plueh, and still brocade, all materials were dls-
played. A lady who is seldom absent, and wh > saemi
as interested in the horses' toilets as she is charming
in her own, wore brown homespun, with laoe, bonnet,
and parasol exactly matching, and suede gloves. Two
Darling Point sisters, very petite and lair, appeared in
handsome dresses, one of Oxford, the other of Cam-
bridge blue, the recent bride choosing the darker. A
magenta rad costume was remarkable in shape, the
tunic body—falling open in front of the skirt, which
was perfectly plain—oime down in a long sweep nearly
to the ground ; the body was plain aud close.fitting j
the skirts wide, with a row of pear-shaped tabs round
the bottom. The coat sleeves, together with the severe
simplicity of shape, gave a distinctive quaintness to the
ensemble of the toilet, in the whole of which
the deep magenta was the only colour seen. Drab silk
and bluoiah pompadour trimmings; a flowered dress of
etrawberry-cum-oroam colour, with light underskirts j
». cloth of dull sky blue; a satin of brighter cerulean on
n tall blonde lady, the little square tabs below being
bordered with small yellow tags or bells j and a lovely
laurel green satin—wero all admirable. Then, for a
tasteful toilet, commend us to that of a brunette, who
combined a panior bodice of corded grey silk with black
satin skirt, under a grey parasol; or to the entire cream
costume of her companion, with corresponding sun.
shade. A jacket of black pekin velvet over white muslin
skirt, with largo scarlet streamer behind, was inharmo-
nious. A rich olaret silk had plaid trimming of same
very buuohily draped round the upper skirt, and the
hat and feather matched. A myrtle green oloth was
very riohly trimmed with gram velvet, which flapped
open at the sides as the wearer walked and showed a
golden yellow satin lining; the row of Vandykes at the
hem, also the wrists, being edged with the saraayel'ow.
An Ash field lady were a light flowered satin with ruby
trimmings, smothered in creamy lace, a very elegant
toilet; an elder daughter donning light brown oloth top,
with passementerie, and dark satin skirt; the younger,
a nice light pompadour and lace. Two Jewish ladies
both wore rich brown velvet skirts —the lesser lady
having a china silk body and paniers; the taller, a
peculiar yellow brown overdress of coarse silky fabric,
covered with embroidery, tint looked stylish and
unique. Exceedingly beautiful was a dress from Potts’
Point of lilac satin, and round the hips was a broad
band of wbito brccbii edged with laoe falling in a
sash behind; white parasol ai d gloves. Two dork
greens, broche tops and hou'jcoined satin skirts,
were good; a pure white muslin with narrow gold braid,
ing under rod parasol, youthful; a cream satin with
orange silk drapery round the front, superb; and a
green tartan in its company qni'e sobjr by comparison.
Very prominent for a while was a iady in black velvet
jacket bodice, beneath which was a startling skirt of
hngo draught-board pattern, in black and white. A
sumptuous dress was all of lichen groan velvet, worn
with n chaplet of oloth of gold roses on the bonnet;
another, a neutral, of ficelle pompadour with plain drab
sleeves, and flcollo parasol. The new style of wearing a
badge, or bow, of velvet, satin, or other material ganor.
ally matching the dress, across the front cf the bonnet,
was adopted by many ladies. Another style of attire,
whose feature consisted of a heavy bunchiness ail round
the waist, a Id fishwife, and then a straight up and down
roomy skirt, was about as devoid of grace and beauty as
it could be In very strong contrast was a stylo which
many thought the prettiest sight on the lawn—the

was in three pleatei flounces, with hip drapery in gros.

Madame Charbonnefc-Kellerman gave an At-
Home, on Monday, at her residence, Darlingh urst,
when, in addition to danoiug, "the soul of music"
shed itself a good deal. The talented little hostess,
like another Undine, was “gowned in pure white that
fitted to the shape,” and Giorza's Fantasia on the Grand
Duchess, with whwh she favoured, was rendered-with a
brilliance which oven the recent church rites don't seem
to have affected. Madame Bosalie Morz-Masden sang,
Woliing’a "Golden Love” charmingly, and a Moore
Park pianisto showed how smoothly the sweet Bine
Danube can flow. An EJgeoliff Bead blende, in blue
satin, and a lady in black were acquisitions.

Fashionable wedding at St. Luke’s Burwood,
28th March. Mr. Alfred Llewellyn Bray, of “ Bray

happy couple standing under a floral arch of white
dahlias, and the pretty little bride looking splendid in
rich moird train and body, with skirt of flounced brue-
eels laoe; bouquet of tiny white dahlias and maiden-
hair. Seven bridesmaids: Miss Kate Daw«on, in darn
Indian muslin, guipure laoe, gold sash, and half-wreath
of marguerites ; Miss Mary Bemmingtou, similar dress,
but peacock sash, aud half-wreath of pink heath; Miss
Constance Dawson, similarly dressed; and tour tiny
fairies in white Indian muslin, peacock sashes and half
wreaths, all wearling long tulle veils. The elder three
wore bracolettod by the bridegroom, and the younger
four wero given lockets and chains. The bride’s mother
wore a rich brown satin and cream Spanish laoe, and
many guests gaaed. Dance at the ro-ideaoo of Mr.
John Dawson, uncle of the bride, at night.

Mr. and Mrs. W. J. Wataon, of Young, gave a
largo ball at their residence on the 20th March, which
celebrated both his birthday and their return from a

rooms, recherche supper, at which Mr. John Bussell
(Mayor) and Mr. James Gordon were vice-chairmen.
Mrs. Bussell and Mrs>. Bailey, of Temora, supported
Mr. Watson on either hand, aod Dr. Heeloy proposed
his health, Mr. Carlo Marina adding a postscript. Mrs.
W. J. Watson wore a tine black satin and broche, with
brilliant gems; and Mrs. John Bussell was handsome
in brocaded cardinal silk, cream satin and lace, and
rosebuds on her tresses. Many other dresses were very
rich, and the ball created some stir about the “ Fiat."

On the 27th ultimo, Mr. H. E. Palmer, of
Goulbum, was married to Miss Sarah Evaline, daughter
of Mr. William Bobberds, of “ Wardy,” up the line.
On that occasion, the present Mrs. Palmer was attired
in soft white China sil», Spanish laoe, orangeblossom.
Clematis wreath, and tulle veil, aud Mr. and Mrs. P.
both wore a look of apprehension. Six maids in at-
tmdanoe wore all robed alike in nice llamas of turquoise
blue, with forget-me-not wreaths. Among the numer-
ous guests, a Concord lady wore a handsome dark
ffeen ottoman siik, with figured underskirt. A young
idy thence wore crushed strawberry satin body and
piniera, plain skirt. From Ashfielel came a tall
married lady in ottoman silk skirt of royal blue,
pleated and much puffed at back, small blue bonnet
to match. Dark green silk, tiny rows of gold braid,
was from Burwood; and from Stanmore were two
sisters, one in lovely fawn silk and brochd, the other in
pure white grass oloth. A married lady from Concord
displayed rich heliotrope satin of two shades, and
oraim Spauith laoe ; and a lady in brown silk and
velvet was much admired. The same evening, a dance
was hold at the bride's residence.

Probably tho Nelson Band did not know when
they played in tho Gardous on Thursday that they fore-
stalled the Vernon boys. However, the public gained.
A novelty in the shape of a bow right across above tho
forehead is becoming popular, ami it may bo made
eflhotive if a lady ohoosoS her colour With taste. Ou
Saturday, the Naval Brigade Bind took up ths stand,
and the attendance was largo, bat not verv gay or grand.
Tho Nelson musician! appeared on the Monday again,
so there was a perfect feast of music last week. A
ropod-olf ring was erected round the lawn, matters
were an improvement on the unseemly crowding that
we have alluded to for some time past. In fact, there
was comfort both to the promenaders, and to those
who preferred to look on and listen, in what the genius
of the seat department calls "cheers.” A lady from
Palmer-street displayed a prominent dross of seal-brown
velvet plash, trimmed with cream laoo, the skirt losing
of shaded old gold, and striped brown plush combined ;
princosi bonnet, cardinal trimmed. Browns seemed to
bo nearly a rule for the best dresses. •'That of a very
portly lady, a mcird antique, all of a dark Japan brown,
was very fine. Then a much lighter one, in two shades
of cinnamon silk, was worn by a young lady, whose
sister’s dress was very similar, only it wandered away
into the shades of darkness again, being nearly maroon,
or rosewood colour t both carried black lace Langtry
hats. Another brown was as remarkab'.e for quaint out
as for its uncommon colour, known as oa!6 au lait. The
double-breasted jacket was made made with waistcoat
front just meeting with one button,and of medium length
The waistcoat was filled in with very small pattern
foulard exactly harmonising, and the front of the skirt
combined the two materials, dull and bright, in alter-
nate kilted 11 )unoes. With rich velvet bonnet, and
gloves to match, the costume had a most complete
effect. A very graceful figure was clothed in black
cashmere, suiting fine brunette features. As a contrast,
a tall, slender blonde was seen under escort, in an olo-
gant dross of bright cure brown, with elaborately
gathered satin skirt, and gloves to correspond. A
lawyer’s wife, very fair, was in light bias plaid But
the palm for stylo lay between mahogany brown and
riflo green stuff costumes Tho former, worn by a lady
of stately mien, was embellished with trimmings of
satin and stamped velvet of same colour, and set off by
tioru throat ribbons, and gloves, and a chaplet of run-
flewera on the princess bonnet. A lady more of the
demoiselle description wore (he green, which was
trimmed with a bow and longitudinal stripes of light
tartan down the skirt, which was rather full. A pair of
silver grays were nice an l quiet; so Was a sage green
zsphyr clath, with Japanese silk sash. An "upright’’
girl, in pure white, was rather pretty, and as well as
electric blue snail, had something decidedly electric
about her bright eyas. And this is an oj portunity t >

clerical assistance. In a buggy, an accomplished lady
in brown, and another in blue silk, drew attention :
they oonld have drawn the buggy if good looks would

white China silk, and a navy blue satin worn by a young
married lady, wore nioe. Black satin and broohd
decked a neat brunette Yass, too. A fine
party at "Rosebank” on Easter Monday, its success
greatly owing to tho stock of young men on hand, who

Many were excellent dancers, a Civil servant from the

THE MARRLAGE MARKET.
Parents, who wonder why their aoaa don’t
marry, or their daughters "gooff," often have them-
telves much to blame. They are too precipitate. Let
a young man call a few times, look at her rather often,
sparkle up when she speaks, and, in fact, make no
attempt to conceal that Agonisa is an attraction for
him, and tho o'd parties harry ap matters at once. Ue
either has “intentions*’ or ha should hava; so they
bring him to confess he has, or jump to that conclusion
themselves with quite inadequate circumstances to
base it on. Then, if he doesn’t come up to it, he is a
scamp who trifles with maidenhood's sweet innocent
affection. This is usual; and it is diverting—to those
not immediately concerned. But it isn’t satisfactory,
and it’s most detrimental to business in the marriage
market. They jump to a conclusion, wo say, and ail of
them, parents, sisters (oh 1 yes, especially sisters), and
friends, commence to chaff, comment, and question,
until they fill Agoniea’a bead with ideas she never had.
She jails to mind every pressure of the hand, which
really meant nothing; every g fane a of the eye, which
was idle playj every flattering word, only spoken
to dll a gap * and then, looking through the
spectacles of her eangnine relatives and speculative
friends, sho sees everything magaifted. Hhe noter
area or ed of love, but now sho is sure of it, and beocnlss
mistakenly happy, or, urged by ill-judged counsels*
tries to lead him to any what he n«r„r had any intention
of saying, disgusts him by what he thinks her uumaid-
only forwardness, and ends by rendering herself
promptly miserable. And there was not a thouaht of
anything beyond iust plain mntnal pleasantness in the
head of either of them till others put it there. Why
can’t people leave people alone? The result is—he is
soared, and a nice girl is spoiled. The youth stands off.
and muses to himself: Can’t I enjoy the society of any
girl, and think her nice, without these meddlers want-
ing to marry us ?—and he vows in future he will keep
on the safe side by only entering into the most open
relations with the women ho meats. So he does; he
sees tluir superficialities i ha never see?, or has a
chnnoe to see, thoso good qualities of excellent girls
which only appear in the coarse of sympathetic friend,
ship, and which ho wants to be assured of before he
marries. Ho determines he won’t marry unless he
knows intimately what the girl is. The old parlies
determine ha shan’t know her intimately until he first
promises h a will marry. And that # B one reason why the
youth dallies and the maidens don’t pass ot! in the
marriage market.
WOMAN ITEMS.

Not long; ago, a professor of the palmistry folly,
which ia living its little crazy day, was exhibiting in a
drawing-room. Ho informed a lately married lady, in
answer to the inquiries of friends, i hat her family would
consist of two children. Boon afterwards, a gentleman
n adc inquiry as to his personal prospeots in that respect,
when the professor intimated that ho oould have no
hope of a family of more than one. Toen there was an
awkward pause. For they were husband and wife.

Formerly, in England, the legal rights of a
married couple wore nearly monopolised bj the bus.
band Everything that was hers, was his j and every-
thing his was his own only. What his wife inherited
was his, aad what she earned was his. On tho other
hand, ho was liable for all her debts, for those con-
tracted in direct opposition to his own protest and
oven for those she incurred before marrying him, or
after ceasing to livo with him. In 1870, an Act was
passed securing to married women, any income they
might acquire by the exercise of literary, artistic, or
soientitto work ; while in 1874 an Act limited the hua-
band's liability for ante-nuptial debts to the amount
hia wife brought into tho Arm when she joined. Now,
that ia, from 1st January, 1883, what a woman brings
with her she can retain, unlesi she specially com ents
to hand it to him. She has a right to enter into legal
contracts and financial specs.; she can personally tne,
and be sued; sho can tike legal proceedings against
her husband in a civil court, just as if he were a
stranger; and if they are not cohabiting, she can prose-
cute him criminally, if she has cause. Her bank
account is absolutely her own. Bnt, per contra, the hus-
band is relieved from some obligations, and especially he
will not bo liable for debts he his for oi idea her to incur.
Io will thus be seen that everything now-a-days tends
to the utter destruction cf the good old condition,
formerly known as the marriage state. Before long,
married people who have grown sick of one another,
will be able, as in soma States of America, to got
divoicel by merely consenting before the Registrar.
The tviiurch of England marriage service, in view of
tae deathblow struck by the civil authority (which,
the Queen being Defender of the Faith, in England
o ; a8h« with tho ecclesiastical authority) against the
old system, is a perfect farce. The Church will now,
no doubt, introduce into its service a clause providing
that nothing contained in tbe religious rite shall inter-
fere with the new Married Woman's Property Act j and
marriages celebrated at churches will henceforth be
registered in Heaven subject to the provisions of the
new enactment.

The state of the stat nte book with regard to ecclesiastical
offences is disgraceful. Unitarians may be proceeded
against under the 9 and 10 Will. III., cap. 160, whioh
provides a maximum penalty of three years’ imprison-
meat, and a minimum of deprivation of ecclesiastical
or civil office for those who " deny the Trinity, or assert
that there are more gods than one.” By the 1 Henry
VI., cap 1, any person "reviling the sacrament ’’ ia sub-
Jeot to fine and imprisonment. Bi'thel Eliz , cap 2,
whoever says anything “ in derogation of the Book of
Common Prayer, ” or who " interferes with a o'ergyman
while singing or saying a prayer,” is liable to imprison-
went for life and forfeiture of his goods and chattels.
By the 13 El ward I., sec. 4, any illegal knowledge ot a

adultery is liable to excommunication and to six
months’ imprisonment.
The ruinous condition of Peterborough Cathe-
dral (concerning whioh matter we have read a great
deal lately in the Sydney daily press) has aroused public
attention in England to the question of what becomes
of the enormous revenues which have grown up from
the original endowments of snoh structures. It is made
apparent that what was not divided among the nobles
at the time of Henry VIII. is diverted by the Cathedral
Clergy into their own pockets. A writer in an English
paper whieh circulates more widely amoag the masses
than any other, deals with tho matter thus ‘ The
revenues, for instance, derived from the property at-
tached to Westminister Abbey reached forty or fifty
thousand pounds per annum, a great part of which con-
sisted in houses mostly inhabited by brothel-keepers
These respectable tenants had to pay very high rents t»
their reverend landlords (er the privilege of living in a
locality where there could carry on their infamons
colling uninterrupted and without fear of police or any
other authority. Well, after disbursing sufficient
from these many thousands to pay the musical and
minor clerical staffs, and a few necessary attendants of
the cathedral, amounting in all to less than seven
thousand annually, the chapter—that is to say, the dean
and six canons—pocketed amongst them the remainder.
Not a farthing was over expended until very lately in
keeping tho fabric of the cathedral in proper repair.
Whilst the halt dozen clerical harpies wore taking five
er six thousand per annum each, the Church was abso-
lutely lumbling about the ears of the oongregration for
want of proper repairs. At one time it was unsafe to
