The Political Judas.
Even Judas has found apologists. This is
somewhat surprising, but not so surprising
as it would seem at first sight. The number
of people who betray is a large one, and
there are a good many of them who have had
wits enough to discover that the easiest and
most efficacious form of betrayal is with a
kiss. Nevertheless we should scarcely expect
such shrewd men to own up to their little
trick. Nor do they. It is only a belated
fool here and there of the party, who in-
genuously makes indiscreet admissions and
helps us “ cx uno discere omnes,”— to perceive
by the pattern what the block material is
like ! .
As with individuals, so with classes.
The political Judas is ever to the fore.
He. is easily recognised. He is the
party in power. Formerly it was the
king the despot, who saluted his sub-
jects with a kiss, and then handed them
over to his armed mob. Then the nobles,
the aristocrats, wrung the power from him,
and learnt how to kiss and betray in turn.
On the wielders of caste followed the wielders
of coin, and the bloated middle-class which
France to-day knows as her bourgeoisie,
Vmerica and we as our shopkeepers, and the
whole world as the potent tribe of the Philis-
tines —stepped into the vacated iolc . They
have been the hardest masters of Petty
tyrants always are. Under their rule,
society has been resolutely divided into two
camps—the classes and the masses, the pos-
sessors and the dispossessed. They have en-
listed both kings and aristocrats on their
side in the only too successful effort to rob
and degrade the masses and keep them so.
The English middle-class used the masses
in the Reform Agitation of 1830, to extort
the control of things from the aristocrats.
They succeeded. The Reform Bill of 1802
handed over England to the Philistines, and
swindled the masses. The fierce outbursts
of Chartism were the impotent effort of the
masses to gain their rights to make the
middle-class fulfil its promises. Then the
kissing trick was brought into play, and the
masses were banded over, tied and bound, to
the police and soldiery of Castedom and the
Pontius Pilate of the aristocrat tribunals !
* * *
The same was done in b ranee. I hat
brigand and cut-throat of empire, Lolls
Napoleon Bonaparte, seized and retained
power there simply as the minister of the
Philistines, as the preserver of law and
order.” At the first great International
Exhibi' ion of 1851, the two groat European
middle classes jubilated. The Queen and
her Consort had followed their natural bent
and put themselves at the head of the
Philistine materialistic boom, and Tennyson
dragged his lyre through the gilded mud
to celebrate their triumph. But note the
peculiar abomination of all this. The
mask was still retained. The harlot
would be a hypocrite. The tyrant would be
an apologist. “Mine,” said Lotus Napo-
leon, “ is a government firm, founded on re-
ligion, justice, uprightness, love of the classes
irhich suffer” —“ Vamour des classes souff-
rantes!” Yes; while the most thorough robbery
and degradation of the mass of the people which
history has ever seen was proceeding relent-
lessly, British and French Philistinism have
neve. ceased to assure the world their rale was
prompted by “ the love of the classes which
suffer !”
* * *
In America, at the same time, the Southern
slave-owners repealed exactly the same cry
about their human “chattels,” and America has
not forgotten —AmeUca can never forget —
that, in the supreme h-mr of her agony and
national humiliation, th-j hour when rebel
flags floated before the walls of her capital
and rebel drams woke the echoes of the
streets, middle-class England and France —
Royal Qaeen and Imperial Emperor, gentle-
man and shopman, parson and priest, on either
side the Channel, openlyand exultantly urged
on the men who aimed that terrific blow at
American Democracy and American Unity—
the Secession War. Let the English Demo-
cracy and the Australian Democracy never
forget it, either. The middle-class has kissed
and betrayed our fathers in the past. Let the
kiss which it offers us in the present be
answered with a blow on the lips !
* * «
We Australians too often forget that we
are not socially isolated We seem to think
that the social problem of other nations —of
England, France, Germany, Austria, Russia,
even America—is not ours. We lose sight
of the similarity of the law in the diversity
of its phenomena. The social problem,
properly speaking, is the same all over the
world—the degradation of the masses—and
that is as much ours as any country’s.
America used to think as we did. “ These
States,” to use Whitman’s grandiloquent
phrase, were never to know tyranny or war.
They 1 were to be the beacon of nations, the
model of races ! Well, at that very hour the
whole South was a horrible monument
of tyranny, and fratricidal war (as the
Old Testament says of the crime
of Cain) “was at the door.” No
matter ! That war righted the wrong !
Tyranny is over now, and “ These States ”
(always with a capi al T and S, please) are
once more going to be the beacon of etcetera,
etcetera. Well, at this very hour the whole
land, north, south, east, and west, is a monu-
ment of a tyranny more horrible still—the
ruin of the democratic yeomen —the degra-
dation of the masses ; so that Henry George,
emphatically an economist and man of peace,
fears that things can only be righted by “ a
revolution.”
* * *
Why is this ? It is because everywhere,
again and again, the Democracy has been
kissed and betrayed by the middle-class —
because once more the political Judas, with
his Public Charities, his Sectarian Relief
Houses, his Distress Funds, his loud-
trumpeted, voluntary restitution to Laborn
of the pennies of the pounds cf which he has
robbed it—the political Judas once more
has successfully played his trick. Every-
where, we repeat, the law is the same —the
trick is the same. It is only the phenomena,
it is only the shape it takes, which are dif-
ferent. The Democracy is as much kissed
and betrayed to-day in Australia by
capitalists and landowners as it has been, or
is, anywhere else,
* * *
Let us take the latest local examples.
The recent riots in London have been of so
serious a nature that even “the stupid
papers,” the out-and-out Tory organs here,
have had to take notice of them. The dear,
dull, old Sydney Morning Herald, like its
prototype, the played-out London Times,
has Eodyet “dropped” to the Judas trick,
and the using of the Democracy as a cat’s-paw,
and so—bless it—it speaks straight ont
for coercion and repression by force :
“If, as the Radical leaders threaten, there will
be another attempt to hold a meeting next
Sunday, the consequences may be painful; but
order must be maintained at any cost, and un-
happy as the resort to force is, it is sometimes the
only way that peace can be best preserved, and
the permanent interests of society upheld.''
Up in Brisbane they are on the eve of a
general election, and it does not do to go
quite so far. We cannot use our teeth : we
can only show them, and explain that modera-
tion is really best, you know. Harken, then,
to the Courier, the local “ stupid paper ” :
“Not even the Duke of Wellington, with some-
what martinet views of the liberty of the subject,
denied the prerogative of the Chartists to march
in semi-military phalanx through the streets of
the metropolis to a fixed objective point, and
there halt and indulge in frothy declamation.
. , . If discontent exists in the capital it is
better that it should have legitimate vent, and no
more innocuous method of allowing t he masses of
the people to blow off the steam of dissatisfaction
could be imagined than in the silent assent to the
time-honoured privilege cf harangue
Taking advantage of these demonstrations, certain
Socialists joined hand in hand with the artisans
out of work, and foolishly marched to the Man-
sion House, displaying banners with the device
‘ bread or work ’ and hoisting Phrygian caps on
more or less greasy poles."
[Those “ more or less greasy poles,” par
parenthe.se , are good—distinctly good. Tney
show such an active imagination on the pare
of the pressman, hired, at so much a column,
to sneer at his fellows. But he forgets that,
if they were greasy, they probably got their
greasiness in the shops of his patrons, the
Philistines.] Well, so much for Annas and
Caiaphas, and what they have to say. It is
stupid enough, and detestable enough. But
for what is truly infamous and revolting, we
must call up the genuine political Judas.
Oh, Sydney Daily Telegraph, arise !
* * *
Listen, Judas is perorating :
“ It is quite true that occasionally these socia-
listic gatherings have been attended by a measure
of violence. Only occasionally, though. Socialism
is a vital force and a far-reaching organisation in
London, inhere may be much error in the doctrines
they advocate, and some of their leaders may
overstep the bounds of truth and prudence in their
harangues, but it has long been believed that in
England truth is trusted to win in its own battles
and liberty is loved too much to be interfered with
because outrages and indiscretions and intimida-
tions are perpetrated in its name.”
“ Dazzle my eyes,” as the poet says, “or do
I see three suns ?” No, you only see a galaxy
of the patent Judaaian rhetorical fire-works.
And there are more to follow. The Govern-
ment that has prohibited these gatheriogs is
“ A Government which represents the privileged
classes in their antagonism to the masses.”
Wherefore, “ the present condition of
things ”
“ Cannot last for ever. It ought not to last for
ever. It is repugnanttothe spirit of Christianity.''
Step up, O crowd of juggling crows ! Judas
wants you. Judas tosses you on the ball.
The land-shark has spoken. The Heaven-
shark must clinch the argument !
* * *
“ 0, generation of vipers, who hath warned
you to flee from the wrath to come ?” Your
brains and stomachs,your schemes and greed !
But we know you 1 Can any good come out
of you ? Do you care one jot or tittle for
the struggles and anguish of the poor and
oppressed, the plundered and slain? You
will batter in their pain and trade in
their agony and sweat ! You have made
civilisation—the House of Mankind —a den
of thieves ! We know you ! But you love
to quote. Here is quota'ion for you —from
Shakespeare, your respectabilised expur-
gated Shakespeare :
“Impudent s'rumpet!
“By Heaven, you do us wrong.”
“Are you not a strumpet ?”
“No, as we are Christians,”
“ What, not a ?”
‘ 1 No, as we shall be saved,
“ Is it possible ? ’
“ O, Heaven, forgive us.”
“ We cry your mercy then !
We took you for that cunning , Philistia,
That married with Democracy!”
AUSTRALIAN CIVILISATION.
A GAOL FLOGGING.
BY FRANCIS ADAMS.
Rain, rain, rain ! Far on into the sleepless
night and morning I can hear it rustling on the corru-
gated-iron roof above me, now softly, now thickly,
as the shower waxes or wanes. My thoughts, off
and on, turn to something which I am going to see
to-morrow. I am going to see two men flogged
in Darlinghurst gaol. I have never seen a man
flogged, but I know that the lash is held by those
who have suffered it to the full as worse than the
rope. These two are to be flogged for unnatural
offences. This seems to me to be, whatever view
I or anyone may hold of the use of the lash, an
abuse of it. It involves the whole sexual problem,
a problem fit to bewilder the greatest and wisest
head that ever sat on human shoulders. This is an
offering not to justice, but to pseudo-religion. These
men were not tried on the merits of v hat they
had done. The ascetic element of a faith based on
the contempt of matter—an unhealthy faith —here
sat in judgment on an unhealthy offence. The law
whichleavesuntouched the man who has fouledand
ruined a girl’s whole existence seizes on one form
of sexual bestiality, and wrecks vengeance on it.
There are other forms which we all know are as
bad, but which we all know pass
at least by the law. Granting all this (as it must
be granted), no one who has eyes to see with, and
senses wherewith he may understand, can feel
satisfied that these men will suffer, either justly or
well, the harshest and most degrading form of our
penal punishment. The physiologist would tell
us that their proper place was in an asy-
lum, not a gaol ; and a healthy and kindly life
the curative necessary, not the lash. Our own
intelligence would tel! us that this punishment
could only make hateful and desperate the
sufferer, and that, just as the unhealthy and un-
kindly life to which he had been born, had bred in
him his offence (and the same is equally true of
you and me); so, if condemned to return to it, he
must needs be the worse for all this. No, his
punishment is clearly due to two things- firstly,
to an exaggerated pseudo-religious sentiment (I only
say exaggerated, not imaginary or false); and
secondly, to the effort of the public opinion that
has held this sentiments, to deter offenders by
terror.
* * *
Such are my thoughts as I lie here sleep-
lessly. Meantime, what are the thoughts of those
two men as they lie, probably sleeplessly, too?
The idea that the criminal feels that he ia a
miserable sinner, and that the respectable people
are human angels, ia surely exploded. No one
can have known the poor of London, of Paris, of
Eastern Australia’s three capitals, as I have done,
and credit them with such stupidity. They know
well that they are what they are made, just as the
respectable people are, and that a change of place
would mean a change of character. Do not
imagine that these men believe they are punished
justly. Do nob imagine that they do not know
that, in the matter of sexual sensuality, you and
I are not much, if any, better than they. Our
faces betray us. Wives and husbands have this
tale to tell, as well as social outcasts and
their male associates. Let us not deny
it, because, what is the good? We only
show that we are nob honest, intelligent,
earnest men, who, recognising the truth of things,
are trying, with God’s help, to make them better.
Jesus never denied this. Nay, it was because He
asserted it with such passionate force that the
Civilisation of His time slew him. No, these men in
their dumb incoherent minds, trapped and powerless
to avert the punishment they fear, brood over the
everlasting personal wrong. ‘ ‘What have I— I done
that I should suffer all this, when thousands, who
have done as bad and worse, go free?” These
men cannot think —they can only brood. Like
animals ill-used, they can only nourish hate of
the whole human tribe that has ill-used them.
Whatyou and I know, they can only feel; but what,
in the long run, is the difference ? • The fullest ap-
plication of 111-use, and punishment for the re-
sults thereof, as sins against morality and civili-
sation, produced brave fruit indeed—food that
must encourage us in our noble task of social
repression. It was applied to the French “ lower
orders ” in the 18bh century, and produced the
French Revolution. It was applied to the French
“lower orders ” in the 19 th century, and produced
the Commune. And it is being applied by us,
with some modifications (for which let us all be
thankful), no less in Australia than in Europe
and America. And what has it produced for us—
for us Australians ? It has produced larrikinism !
Well, my brothers, you two who are lying sleep-
lessly as I am—you in gaol, I in my home—all three
looking forward to that “ceremony” which is to
take place to-morrow —our thoughts are not ia
reality so very different! I shall know that
wrong—that injustice which leads civilisation to
degrade men and then punish them for their
degradation—and you will only feel it athwart
your fear and anguish, and the after-hours of
impotent hate. I shall stand and watch you, and
think that I have as much call to be lashed on
those triangles as you. There will be at least one
man who will not look upon you as upon a show,
but as upon brothers, victims of the hideous
iniquity which here is called Civilisation. Raio,
rain, rain ! Will to-morrow be like to-day ? The
lampless, grey - clouded heavens, the driving
showers are its fittest accompaniments. Rain,
rain, rain 1

The clouds have broken by the morning.
The flrmamental blue peeps through here and
there. Then the clouds close again, and then re-
open ; but at last, by afternoon, the character of
the day is fixed. Thin, lofty, white banks lie
along the sky beside great blue gulfs. The frogs
cease their delighted screeching, and croak more
soberly. The birds sing here and there—
“So pricketh hem nature in hir corages,”
as Chaucer says. Everywhere are those pure,
tender, jewelled tones which the Sydney atmo-
sphere excels in. Something of the close of the
summer’s day is upon things. It is five o’clock now
and the little group of those who are to be specta-
tors of the “ ceremony ” is gathered in the space be-
tween the outer and inner gates of the gaol. The
inner gate la of iron bars, and through it you can
see the interior. The interior is quite pretty.
Flowers are much cultivated there. The beds are
full of them. Green trees wave to and fro in the
gentle breeze, the birds singing in the boughs.
There is an effort to hide the iron gauntlet under
scraps of velvet. Nob a trace or a sign of a
prisoner ! As we are let through the gate, as we
walk along the well-kept paths, as we pass on
right into the heart of the prison—still not a trace
or a sign of a prisoner! We come to an inner
gate, and are kept at pause a moment. There
are five or six of us, of whom the strangers are
three reporters (myself one) and a well-fed, well-
dressed individual who has been brought here, he
tells me, by curiosity. Curiosity is a large word, and
once it was a noble one, as we find it in Latin and
still in French. But there is a smack of the
“butchered to make a Roman holiday” sort of
thing here, and that is simply loathsome. My fel-
low-pressmen, I learn, are of the order of cordial
approvers of punishments like this. So I stand
in silence, a little apart, listening, or not listening,
to the general talk. I can just catch the notes of
the birds in the garden. They come here on the
wind. Then we are let through, and pace on
again. It appears “these affairs” (to use the
accompanying warder’s phrase) are “ kept quite
at the back.” We came to a stop opposite a pas-
sage, through the door at the end of which
another warder comes, and almost immediately
the Governor is with us. A grey-headed man, but
still in the prime of life ; courteous withal, and
with a kindly look!
“ Now, gentlemen 1” he says, and leads us
through the door, and we are on the appointed
spot.
Imagine an alley between two high, bare brown
brick walls. One wall ia that of the prison building
the other is the outer circumambient wall. At
either end the corner turrets are visible, a sentry
in each, armed with his musket. Twenty or
or thirty yards up, fixed against the inner wall, ia
a wooden frame. It is like a large towel-horse.
There is a cloth in front of it, on the ground.
Standing up against it, a bare arm tied up to either
post, his feet tied together in the middle, is a man.
His face is to the wall and a coat is flung over his
shoulders. Perhaps he has been waiting a little,
and it would be a pity for him to take cold ! His
shirt and hat are on the ground against the wall,
a little way off. As we advance, a warder, a
little stout, grey-headed man who has been con-
cerning himself with these things, removes the
coat. At the same time the man turns his face
and looks at us. It is not a man at all! It is a
mere lad of 16 or 17, with a pink and white face.
The face is the reverse of bestial or degraded. The
dark eyes are rounded with apprehension. We all
pause, and there is a silence. A bird begins to
sing. I lift my face, catching a glimpse of a great
space of an unfathomable blue sky overhead, and
notice a few straggling trees further up the alley.
The boy turns back his face again. There is a
movement. The doctor has arrived. You would
think he was going to a garden-party at the
Governor's. He has just that look; but he has a
black stethoscope in one hand, and that bespeaks
the chances of business. Is it really necessary to
appear in an irreproachable bell-topper, frock-
coat, and high collar, on such an occasion ? Yes,
because this is a “ ceremony," and the doctor is one
of the officials. Civilisation expects this of its
officials. The Governor and he shake hands.
let us begin. The boy has said something to
the little stout grey-haired warder, apparently
(who is now standing to the left, passing his
fingers through the tangled locks of the maiden
cat), for his coat has been left on one of the bars in
front of him, and he has it now in his mouth. He is
going to be brave. He will need all his bravery. He
is white-skinned and slight; clearly, a sanguineous
temperament with a good admixture of the
nervous. He will suffer. Think of that, my
benevolent, respectable ascetics—the redoubtable
“classes” whose scorn of the flesh makes cold
your matrimony. Think of that. This “ sinner”
will suffer for his “ sin.” God has given him a
temperament which your punishment can reach
to almost perfection. There is a pause, while
another warder on the far side (he is to tell the
number of the strokes) takes his place. The bird
breaks into song again. The Governor makes a
signal. The little, stout, grey-headed warder,
who is standing a yard and a-half or so off, his
feet together, suddenly flings out the lashes —
makes a curious, quick, forward stay, with/ his
right foot, and the next instant the cat is
round the quailing shoulders ; the;re is a smothered
cry, the coat drops from the boy's mouth, and the
little, stout grey-headed warder- is in position again
But whether the other warder cried “One,”
or whether the bird went on. singing or not, I can-
not tell you.
The lad’s back, shewing a mark like a faint
scarlet scarf, shake'j and shudders like a quick-
sand in the tide- ‘ hen out whirl the lashes again

are all spasmodic, and so is the shriek.
“ Four /”
‘ It is all over with him I The fascination of
torture is upon him. His great apprehensive ey

“My heart,” he cries, “it thumps !”
“Turn your head round,” says the Govern
not unkindly, “ or you’ll get it in the face.”
“ Six! '
“ I can’t, T can’t!” shrieks the boy, shaking
over convulsively. The scarf is losing all
lovely scarlet colour. It is getting an angry re
but it is still quite symmetrical, you observe.
“ Seven! . . Eight! . . Nine /”
It is strange, but it seems to me as if he we
quite naked, tied loosely—a worm writhing fra
tically as it is transfixed again and again with
pin. My boy, this should teach you to love Go

I wish you would turn your face away, and tho
awful apprehensive eyes. They mike me wond
if, after all, this is as edifying a “ ceremony ” as
might be.
“ Ten ! ’
There! The Governor was right. You hav
got it in your face. You may well flinch. Tur
round, foolish boy. This is all for your good, an
the good of society.
“ Eleven ! . , . Twelve ! . . . Thirteen! . .

The angry red has got blue now in parts, but
seems as it that flue little civilising machine wer
beginning to vary the pattern. The hiss of th
lashes is becoming more like a whistle.
“ Fifteen ! . . . Sixteen I . . . Seventeen .

They loose him, and he stands, his han

Tho pause is made the occasion for genera,
conversation, and presently I hear one of my fellow
pressman enunciating the opinion that the boy
was a coward. This leads to my blandly pointing
out the fact that the triangles are now empty, and
that, if my fellow pressman would care to try the
effect of four or five strokes on his own hide (with a
coat, waistcoat, shirt, and vest to cover it), 1
should have the greatest pleasure in the world in
seeing and putting on record how he bore It. But
my proposal was not entertained, and the second
victim appearing on the scene acted as a diversion.
He was a grey-headed old man, very much resem-
bling our old friend, the cuttle-fish warder. He came
along quite quietl5 r , no particular emotion on his
face, but the Ups had an uncertain movement, that
betokened fear. He tcok his place, and held up his
armsto belashedwiththeutmostdocillty. Then once
more the two officiating warders fell into position,
and our group gathered closer together. I hai a
no heart to repeat the wretched business in detail
a second time. After three or four strokes the
old man began to mutter to himself, and at last
his mutterings became articulate, repeated over and
over again ; “ God, oh, God 1 and God have
mercy upon me 1” We know no more of God
than that, in the everlasting words of Jesus, He
“is a spirit ’—an unseen force whose power we
can all feel, but every attempt to define which has
only ended in anthropomorphic blasphemy. That
God, then who is the conscience cf humanity, will
some day have mercy on such as that poor
lad and this wretched old man, I
trust and believe. Wherefore, it is best,
0 old man, that in your anguish you
shoula call on For to call on men seems
vain—at least, on tie men who can hear you cry.
The old man never shrieked or howled. He only
kept up that low mutt. | f y, which fell and rose
as the lashes hissed into L,, back. He had twelve
strokes, and was then loosened and led away, and
we silently followed.

Once more in the garde v'' Governor
courteously Invited his partake of
whisky and water, but it wanted some-
thing different from whisky and water to take
away the taste I had in my mouth. Sol went
straight on, and out alone. But, inside the inner
gate, I paused a moment to look back.
There was the tall, strong prison-house,
and the surrounding buildings. There was
the pretty interior with its beds full of
flowers, the tall white lilies bowing gracefully,
floral queens of the place. Green trees wave to and
fro in the gentle breeze, the birds singing in the
boughs. And through it all I see two great, black,
ghostly, apprehensive eyes—l see the white, youth-
ful, quivering, lacerated body—l hear the agon-
ised cry, “ I can’t! I can’t!” Then the clean-
shaved face of the grey-headed old man peers out,
and he lifts up his helpless hands muttering,
“ God, Oh God ! God have mercy upon me!” I
turn away sick at heart. The outer gate closes, and
the lock clanks behind me. Let ua write up over
the gates of this edifice—over the gates of the edi-
fice of Civilisation's Penal Power —what Dante saw
written up over the gates of Hell—

Bread for England—The Centennial
Fund.
Australia is praised among nations for open-
handedness. From the bounty with which she is
dowered it has been said that she gives freely. It
is a by-word over the earth that to Australia no
one appeals in vain for help. Even effete and
phthisic organisations, which receive scant favour
in the country of their origin, come hither and
fatten like vampires on the bosom of this country
charity. Jubilee presentations, Imperial fad
institutes and navies, governors for New
Guinea, Primrose Leagues, and various othe
useless and parasitic contrivances, have suoke
freely without let or hindrance. Australia ha
helped Ireland in her famines—she has eve
helped the land of tin leprous Chinese. Austra
lia has never helped England. It is a reiteran
boast that we are mainly of English origin. W
boast of our race on holidays, and sing “ God sav
England’s Queen ” both in and out of seamn
Some of the colonies are Freetrade in their polic
for no other reason under Heaven than that it ap
proximates somewhat to the fiscal system
of the “ dear old mother country.” We ar
madly loyal on princes’ visits and princes’ birth
days, and we choke with crimson faces in
fevrous paroxysm of loyalty to England
when utterance is made of federal movement
and enthusiastic appeals for a “ closer union ” ar
mooted. We try feebly, most of us, to speak the
grand old English tongue—and some few succeed
after a painful fashion. Let us put all this lip
loyalty to the test I Beneath the shadow of the
Lions in Trafalgar Square those whom we cal
English and brothers are starving. They cry fo
food—“ Bread or Work I” But the alternative i
a mockery. They cannot eat “ work,” and instead
of “bread” the authorities in the Modern Baby
lon are feeding London’s poor on the policeman’s
baton. “Let the hungry be fedl” said the
driveller Tennyson. You, comparatively for
tunate Australians, can feed them 1 You have
more than you can eat! Your lot is a moderately
happy one. Your poets sing 'of your land that it
is one of milk and honey, and you never contra
diet them. For the sake of the past from which
you have escaped to this prosperous present, feed
your wretched English relatives. You, who boast oi:
England, let it not be a reproach amongst nations
that you disclaimed the family tie, in the hour of
her adversity. Many of you—yes, you, person-
ally—have felt that terrible grinding, yawning,
aching pain which men inadequately describe as
hunger. On the plains, in the remote bush,
you may have felt it, far from men, but it was
Nature’s sterility and not man’s pltilcasness that
caused your agony. What must it be to starve
TANTALUS-like in the midst of rioting plenty and
profuse luxuriousness 2 Some of you, again,
have hungered in London, and snatched, by a
happy fortune, from that hell in moroar, came
here to starve no more. Some of you have never
wanted and mayhap never will. Whoever, what-
ever you are, wherever you may be, give of your
abundance now to the nation from which you say
boastingly you sprung, of whose greatnesi you
prate, whose heroes you claim, for whose fortunes
you profess devotion even to death, for whose
continuance of love toward you, you pretend to
be so tensely solicitous. Give, and fittingly
celebrate your centennial, not in mortar —
but in bread. Feed, if but for a few days,
the pauper-stricken thousands of England,
and for the evil of the past hundred years of your
history substitute a noble charity to usher in
your second century. This bread-fund for E g-
land's starving shall be the touch-stone of your
vaunted love for the mother Country. Take up
the challenge if you are English—if you are
human!

A New Brand of Insanity.
Attorney General Wise and Dr. Cortis, M.P.,
though neither of them ranks as a specialist in in-
sanity, have probably done more than any other
existing New South Wales politicians to educate
the public in the causes and mysteries of mental
disease. The theory on which their Ideas are
mostly ba c ed is that the violent concussion of £4B
of his employer’s money against a well connected
youth with a reliable Parkeai' 6 member to speak
on his behalf invariably lea s to insanity and
makes the patient irresponsible for his actions,
while, on the other hand, the shook of -1 s. 6d.
coming against a young man who is not well-
connected and has no Parkesite voter to earwig
the Government on his account, leads to 10 years
penal servitude. As an example of this Mr.
Pruen, of the Hail way Department, Bathurst
recently annexed £4B, and pleaded guilty, and
though a great effort waa made to get up sympa-
thy on his behalf as being “ a mere boy,” the
facts remained that he waa six feet high, and
aged 20, and waa thus three years older than
more than one of the four common, obscure,
ignoble youths who only last January served
in New South Wales as food for the gallows
as pendant sacrifices to the “virtue” of a lying
street-walker—as judicial offerings to the oath of
a bloodsoaked forger. But Pruen was ‘ 1 well-
connected,” and straightway the plea of “ in-
sanity ” was set up for his relief. Dr, Cortis
buttonholed the Government in dark passages,
and pointed out that Pruen s parents were
“ most worthy people,” and that his madness war
clearly proved by the fact that he toox only £lB
instead of cleaning out the premises, and that he
took it in a lump instead of by slow Instalments.
That is to say, he was mad because he didn’t tak»
more, and he was also mad because he took so
much as he did; he was mad both ways and oi'her
way. The doctor, however, did not dare to ap-
pear in the witness box to enunciate his amazing
theories. Possibly he was afraid lest he might be
asked to define the madness of the burglar who
takes a chair and leaves a sofa behind, or who takes
the chair all at once instead of one leg at a time.
In Pruen’s case, most likely, Dr. Cortis gave his
political, not hla professional, opinion. Instead,
however, of the Parkesite member being severely
censured by Attorney-General Wise for his shame-
ful attempt to tamper with justice before the case
had even come before the Courts, a minute was
straightway fixed up by Mr. Wise in which it
was suggested that Pruen should plead guilty
and be discharged, and the parents of the interest-
ing young patient being allowed to pay up he was
released. He was not sent to have his aberration
cured in a madhouse, be it noted, but was simply
sent out to, perchance, inflict the evils and in-
juries attendant on his peculiar kind of mental
disease upon his next employer. And here
the question naturally arises what hind of a
minute the N.S.W. Crown Law Office would have
fixed up had some valuable Government
supporter come to it before a trial to arrange
about having a prisoner barged ia p’ace of released.
The arrangement, if logically carried out, would
work equally well either way. Pruen is now
enjoying the sweets of liberty, and meanwhile the
lopsided goddess of justice continues to grow vir-
tuously indignant over the cases of other “boys”
who have stolen eighteenpencs, and in the absence
of a Parkesite member to shake up the fount
of mercy on their account they are sent to
gaol, and when their parents offer to pay
up they are told that it would be compounding a
felony and a sin against society. There is thus a
wonderful difference in different th'eves. The
youth who has a rich and influential father, and a
friend who votes the Parkfs’ ticket in the House,
and who embezzles without the slightest tempta-
tion, is the kind of lunatic who ia not responsible
for his actions, but not the kind of lunatic who is
sent to the safe keeping of an asylum, while the
youth wheso steal is palliated by his necessities,
who has no rich father and no friend in the Ouse, is
the sort of madman who gets three years among
the ha dened ruffianism of the gaol, or if he
should escape as being mentally incapable, he is
speedily lost in the cool seclusion of Tladesville
Asylum. The machine of law is greased for the
rich by means of backstairs influence, and the
mode of greasing is evidently cf a kind which will
not permit cf the operation being publicly per-
formed, And while it is greased for the rich, it
is, as usual, strangely rusty for the poor. The
Government which releases Pruen without a
trial will not even take Newman’s chains off,
although his innocence now amounts almost to a
certainty. “ Justice ! ” Justice be !

The “S. M. Herald ” Excuses
Dynamite
A Correspondent writes :
“ The S.M. Herald labours heavily to prove that all the
Lon-’on unemployed riots are fomented by French and
G rnun anarcaists who persuade the hithe/to law-abiding
Bill Jones that Providence never me«nt him to watch his
wife and children starve in a da up cellar while somebody
was gorging on chicken and champagne within a stone s
throw Strange the Herald does not object to the German
paupers who sit on England s throne and eat the chicken
and drink the champagne."
The Herald, however, labours not so much, in
the leader alluded to above, to prove the French
or German anarchistic origin of the riots, as that
the present condition of society is the best possible,
and ought to be maintained at the cost even of all
the horrors of wholesale butchery. It says in
effect that the present government of the world Is
government by the fittest, and they have a perfect
right to resort to any and every means which
will embastioa their rule. The fittest rule
because they are the strongest also, and the cun-
ningest, and the most crafty and unscrupulous
The noblest could never hope to rule, because
nobility of character unfits a man for sovereignty.
To take a low example, it is not every man who
has the gall to demand 200 per cant, on a blood-
sweating loan to a workman. The typical notion
of hells monarch is the ideal earthly king,
Christ— and with all reverence for His beautifully
Communistic and broadly human characi or bo it
spoken—could never govern as a turestial ruler.
He said, with tremendous truth, “ My kingdom is
not of this world.” How could it by ? Look at
the things that govern, and have governed for
ages immemorial! Yet such immoral and heart-
less canaille are the Herald’s heroes and the
Herald’s gods ! Tne argument of the Herald
however, is an excuse for dynamite. Here it is :
If, as the Radical leaders threaten, there will be another
attempt to hold a meeting next Sunday, the consequences
may be painful; but order must be maintained atony co*t,
and, unhappy as the resort to force is, it ia sometimes the
only way that peace can be b st preserved, and the per-
manent interests of society upheld.
Of course, the foregoing presumes that society, as
at present constituted, despite the hideous wrong
which condemns 99 men out of every 100 to a life
of cheerless ard ugiesome drudgery, is the society
whose “ permanent interests ” are worth preserv-
ing. This is really the old, old argument dating
back in antiquity beyond the legless legend of the
forbidden fruit—
That they should take who have the power,
And they should keep who can.
Some day the proletarian should he hold the
masterful whip hand, may make another applica-
tion of the Herald’s argument. The paper dare
not complain. The lithotribian master of the
situation would say that by force or fraud, or
cunning or crafr, he had a good seat and a short
stirrup, and that as the existence of the Hera d
was detrimental to the best interests of the
society which he represented, the great mob, the
vulgar and despised sans-culottcs, had decreed
that the office of the paper must be burnt down
and razid to the ground, and every stick of it
consumed with fire, &c. ; and the Herald dare
not complain, for they have already proved the
case agdirst the weakest, and must abide by the
issue - no res'stance against any authority how-
soever constituted. On the same argument, the
fat. pursy parson who gobbles up the goodly glebo
and refuseth to disgorge, shall rightly and pr
perly be hoisted into Heaven with a hand-grenac
that the “permanent interests of society”—th
future dominant society, no matter of wh
brand —may be upheld. The Herald’S leader
an incitement and an excuse In advance for t
employment of explosive bombs. Mind, the log
Is the Herald’s, not The Bulletin's.

“At Home.”
The Anglican church organ, The Guardian, com
menting on the Rational Divorce Bill of NewSout
Wales, in an article evidently inspired from th
church’s headquarters, observes that if the measur
is not vetoed, the “church should refuse to assist a
the re-marrisga of divorced persons, and shoulc
repel them from communion and the participation
of church privileges.” In other words, the ohurcl
howls blatantly that the law must be recognised
when it is a question of a freethinker carrying hit
views into effect, but it claims the power to ignore
it when its own pleasures are touched. Again, I
trusts that the veto may be applied, if only on the
ground that it would be inexpedient to have a dif
ferent marriage law in the colonies from that
which obtains “at home.” So far as we are con-
cerned, Australia is “ home,” and we do not feel
called upon to frame our legislation to suit
tbs snail pace of a foreign country, whether that
country’s convenience is concerned or not. If that
position obtains, however, and a foreigner is to
veto our measures on account of the traditions of
her own country, it affords the very best argu-
ment why we should not suffer any outside sove-
reignty at all. The same argument, too, might
have been used to deprive us of every other item
of social civilisation in which we are ahead of the
land that was not good enough for ‘ ‘ our ances-
tors” to live in. Manhood suffrage, th 3 partial
(for as'yet it is but partial) emancipation of labour,
the negation of titles, tithes, and privileged
paupers, the Institution of general education, and
what not else, would be—where ? In short, the
sooner the right we have proved in these oases, to
manage our own affairs in our own way without
the interference of English or any other conveni-
ence-mongers, aristocrats, or theocrats, is de-
manded absolutely for all cases, the better for our
own progress.

Foreign Capital.
It is fashionable at present to assert that the new
craze for “ English capital ” to develops every-
thing in Australia, is a particularly bright idea.
We will proceed to show that it is not—or at least
that it is much brighter on the side away from
Australia. The land has got enough men to de-
velope everything that it requires for itself. It
has got enough food to maintain all those men,
and yet, owing to the artificial conditions of life,
the food does not come to them quickly enough.
Introduce an external stimulus to any particu’ar
industry, and some other industries must be in-
sufficiently supplied with workers, prices will be
artificially raised, and then there will bean inrush
of English goods as well as capital, slackening off
the local industries still further, and depriv-
ing residents of the means of earning their
bread. In the same way it works back to the
farmers; their numbers are reduced, and the
remainder make no increased profit in conse-
quence, because people are poorer and cannot
buy as much food as they need, and what they do
buy they have to get on credit and cannot pay
for. Traders fail in consequence, prices go up
from necessity, and fall without avail from still
greater necessity; but they cannot harmonise
even at lowest with the public purse, fer earnings
go down, except in the few favoured Industries,
and endless complications ensue. If money were
not a god—if it were, as It purports to be, a mere
tally of exchange—what would be the use of in-
troducing any number of foreign tallies, especially
paying hire for them ? It is just the same whether
the foreign commodity be goods or the tally for
reckoning them. If it disturb the natural state
of events locally, it is as necessary in one case as
the other that there should be some measure
taken locally for self-protection.

The Traitor Griffith.
Sir Samuel Griffith Is in a disgraceful dilemma.
He has politically sold his country to an Imperial
purchaser, and now finds that the Queensland
Assembly lias a natural objection to ratify the
bargain. He attended the Imperial Conference
flaunting the grandeur of his Premiership. Tory
condescension and a dole of Royal patronage fed
his overgrown vanity, and made him an easy
instrument in the hands of the Imperial gang.
They paid him his price of flattery, and he gave
in return the power which his colony had en-
trusted to him. From thenceforth he sold him-
self body and soul, and assumed to sell his colony
to Imperial purchasers. He went to England
professedly to forward Australian interests, but
the bribery he encountered was greater than he
could withstand, and he became a traitor to
Queensland and the enemy of Australia. The
only redeming feature in his conduct Is his faith-
fulness to his corrupters: he has sold himself to
the Imperial devil, but with the honour proverbi-
ally said to prevail among one class of persons,
he insists that the contract shall be fully
performed at the cost of the colony which ha
assumes to have represented in the bargain. Hii
treachery emphasises the danger to which Aue-
tralia is now exposed. Titles come from England ;
royal favours are dispensed to Australians at the
bidding of the dominant party there ; bribes which
no other power can bestow are in the gift of En. -
land s Government, and under these circumstancej
Australian interests are constantly liable to be
made the subjects of bargains as morally corrupt,
aid as politically disastrous as that to which th
Traitor Griffith has made himself a party
Graham Berry changed from a bold Radical
Australian to a mean, drivelling Tory
when he was bought by a K.C.M.G.-ship. Dow-
ner, the Premier of South Australia, was so far
overcome by his emotion when in the presence of
England’s nobility at the conference, that he, the
fluent and eloquent, was obliged to rely
upon manuscript for the matter, and even the
words, of his speech; like obedient yeomen,
the Australian delegates yielded a meek
consent to a set of cut-and-dried proposals
and in all things did as they were Imperially bid.
And so it will always be as long as the present
system obtains. As soon as new men are raised
to power in the Australian states, they are bought
over by Imperial authority. Every Premier hes
his price. So far, flattery and knighthoods have
been sufficient to furnish traitors to Australia, but
if higher prices are required they will be tendered
before Imperial designs will be permitted to fail
through. A federated and independent Australia
is the only preventive against a continuance of
the present practice of corruption. So long as
there are Imperial bribes to be offered, so long
will there be Premiers to accept them, and just so
long also will Australian imprests be sacrificed to
Imperial designs.


The Cost cf Australian Dependence.
Each of the Australian Assemblies now has a
chance of showing by its treatment of the
Naval Defence proposals, how much Australian
loyalty is worth for spot cash. There is no get-
ting away from the solid fact that, if the bonds
which bind the colonies to the mother country are
to be maintained at all—if, in fact, Australian
dependence is to be continued —some such tribute
must be yielded to the Imperial Exchequer, and
the present proposals are possibly as equitable as
could be expected. The matter stands thus :
Australia's peace is entirely dependent upon the
inability of English Jingoes to run the nation into
war. As soon as that party are able to find a suf-
ficient pretext for breaking England’s peace, the
safety of Australia is endangered. Wnile the
present dependence of these States is maintained,
Australians must ever be ready to resist an attack
by any power which English Jingoism has pro-
voked or attacked. And, in the event of war, it
would be madness to rely on English aid. With a
small and ineffi' ient army, a navy demoralised by
corrupt and imbecile administration, England
would have to draw upon every resource to pro-
tect herself in a war with a first-rate Power ; the
colonies would have to look after their own
safety. Therefore, it is necessary, under
present circumstances, that some such pro-
posals as those now under review should be
adopted with the smallest possible delay. It is
no use paltering with the question. If dependence
is to continue, its cost must be paid at the risk of
our qualified freedom. If no such defence is to
be procured, action to dissolve the present union
of the colonies and the “Mother Country” should
immediately ensue. There is no safe middle-path
of tolerance of the present position. An indepen-
dent Australia need fear no foes, and need re-
gard no war unless it pleased her ci'izens to make
one. We would then have the same defence as at
present— i.e., the ability to defend ourselves, and
this would be coupled with an immunity from
the danger of being involved in England’s wars —
a danger, very present, and very real, under the
present position of dependence. The prevailing
attitude of Iccal Assemblies is very cowardly and
very mean. Members glory in the dependence of
Australasia upon England, but refuse to part
with the price of that state ; they talk boastfully
of a closer alliance, but decline to pay the cost of
the present alliance. Loyalty to the Empire is
not strong enough to produce the dollars which
should stand as its evidence, and of loyalty to the
best interests of Australia—to the independence
of Australia—there is, or seems to be, absolutely
none. Members wish to be dependent still, but
refuse to vote the cash necessary to sustain their
condition in security.
Give Parkes a Penny I
There are times when we wonder if even Parkes
himself is not ashamed of the means which are
being adopted to raise a dirty little testimonial in
honour of his fifty years of ic solvency and
bungling. An average sum of Is 6d. apiece has
been screwed out of 331 poor, half starved wretches
at the National Park, while 380 semi-destitute
laborers employed on relief works at Narrate ?n
have been bled to the extent of some 2s. each, in
order that a sumptuous politician, who says he
only wants to die, may live, and buy bric-a-brac
and speculate in land. If bll these 711 poverty-
stricken men have handed out the contributions,
which they could so ill spare, out of sheer love for
the glib land speculating poi itician whose miserable
salary of £2OOO a year is so eminently calculated
to arouse the sympathy of the opulent pick-and-
shovel man, then we have nothing to say, but
when this great host of impoverished labourers
deny themselves actual necessaries that they may
enjoy the pure delight of helping Parkes, the rea-
sonable conclusion is that the man who doesn’t
help Parkes gets sacked at the first plausible
exonse. No doubt this assumption will be indig-
nantly scouted by the Parkes committee, but re-
cent revelations have sunk the reputation for
veracity of at least part of that body very low. The
whole souled denial of the allegation that the cop-
pers of the school-children were being raked in
in aid of a politician to whom even the baby’s
penny seems welcome, did not fit very well with the
swarm of circulars distributed to almost every
scholar in N.S.W., and it will take something
more than mere denial to convince the public that
the sixpences and shillings subscribed by the
Mick Connors, Larry Coonans, and Patsy
Gallaghers on the Relief Works were the spon-
taneous offering of grateful proletarians who ha* e
nothing to be grateful for. Most of the sub-
scribers. strangely enough, bear Irish names, and
this wild anxiety on the part of the Hibernian
Catholic to subscribe for the blatant Orange
Parkes is, to say the least, suspicious. If it is
genuine charity, without any element of coerc’on,
then have the days of miracles come back. Don’t
tell us, please, that anybody named Mickey
Doolan votes the Parkes ticket.
The other night in the N.S.W. Legislative As-
sembly, John Haynes, M.P., for Mudgee,
introduced an amending Electoral Bill in which he
purposed to do away with the £lO propei ty qualifi-
cation for candidates. This is a genu’ne reform,
and undoubtedly one reform which was first
mooted by Hav nbs. Whatever of credit there is
belongs to him, and that he deserves credit in the
matter, no democrat can deny. But Parkes, the
arch-plagiarist, who never originated anything
in his life, from the notion of secular education,
filched from Greenwood, down to the Railway Bill
prigged from Victoria's, fiercely snubbed his
humble follower, and bade him drop his Bill —leave
it to him (Parkes). Haynes rightly and properly
re'used, and of course had the pig- vote against
him. Yet this man Parkes has the supernal
audacity to pose as a patriot, although he has
persistently blocked every good measure—when
he had the power—which he did not introduce
himself.

The Victorian Legislative Council, the House of
the Glutton’s Snore, has, up till lately, been a sub-
ject for irreverent jest. It has been called a
morgue, a fossil museum, a mummy chamber,
anything that conveyed the idea of vast antiquity
and more than ordinary deadne6s. But the good
old drowsy Saturnian reign is approaching its
close, and a new era is about to begin. Two
young men have actually got into this Abode of
Ancient Peace —Mr. C, H. Jambs and Dr. LbFevre.
Both of these gentlemen, though labouring under
the misfortune of riches, are under 10 years of
age. It is quite reasonable to suppose that if
they had energy enough to accumulate as much
coin as would satisfy any five or six ordinary men,
and still remain young, they would have plenty
of energy to spare for public duties. Qui vivra
verra. But we feel for the poor old gentlemen
whose pleasant slumbers are over— Macbeth hath
murdered sleep. We may state, by the way, that
both James and Le Fevrb are in favour of the
£lO franchise. This is a sure sign that the days
of the Troglodytes in the Victorian Legislative
Council are swiftly passing away.
HISTORY OF BOTANY BAY.
It was England that first seamed the white
shoulder of Australia with the livid mark of the
lash. It is the people who wielded that instru-
ment of degradation, and their descendants, who
wish to “draw the bonds of Empire closer” to-
day. The Imperial connection is, therefore, a
shameful one.
* * *
It was not a pleasant problem that con-
fronted the British Cabinet just three years before
the French Revolution. A large proportion cf the
population, cradled into crime by poverty and ig-
norance, had been convicted of more or less
serious offences. It was clearly impossible to
hang them all. Earnest effort? had been made to
meet the difficulty in this decisive manner, but
even the best intentions sometimes fall short rf
adequate performance. The question was even
assuming a more irksome phase. An official com-
munication, dated from Whitehall, August 18,
1786, informed the Lords Commissioners of the
Treasury that the gaols ware crowded, and that it
would be necessary to ship the prisoners off some-
where. The revolt cf the American colonies was
a serious bore to my Lords of the Treasury, for
they had for some time past been adding a yearly
sum of £40,000 to the revenue by selling offenders
as white labour to the planters. Now that market
was closed, and the article became a drug on
the purveyo. s’ hands. The experiment was
tried of sending a portion to the fever-coast of
Africa. So many died there that sentence of
transportation became synonymous with sentence
of death. But this was cheating the hangman,
and allowing a fine old British institution to fall
into contempt. This wasun English. Something
else would have to be done. Clearly, the Lords
Commissioners were deserving of every sympathy.
They received it in the shape of suggestions.
* * *
Humane men looked into the question in
the light of their environment, and in the spirit
of the country and of the age. They embodied
their results in a series of proposals that might
curdle the blood with horror But as it is ir ad-
visable that the reader should exhaust his capacity
“Forty persons died on the voyage.”
for disgust before he comes to our own immediate
record, perhaps these are as well left alone. The
most merciful proposition was one suggesting
transportation to Botany Bay. In 1787 a book was |
published called “ A History of New South Wales,”
the preface to which, written by a well known
Cabinet-creature of the period The Hon. William |
Eden—strongly recommended the Botany Bay 1
scheme. What he there wrote throws light on the
whole aspect of the question Criminals, when
their lives or liberties are forfeited to justice,
become a forlorn hope, and have always been
judged a fair subject of hazardous experiments
If there be any terrors in the prospect before the
wretch who Is banished to New South Wales, they
are no more than he expects ; if the dangers of a
foreign climate are nearly equivalent to death, the
devoted convict naturally reflects that
offended justice, in consigning him to the inhospit-
able shores of New Holland, does not mean there-
by to seat him for his life on a bed of roses." If
the devoted convict in bis natural reflections ever
did lapse into that idyllic train of thought, he was
most woefully mistaken.
Mr. Eden was a philanthropist—save the
mark I —and a colleague cf Howard in a portion of
his work of prison-reform. One of bis recommen-
dations reads thus “ The more enormous
offenders might be sent to Tunis, Algiers, and
other Mahometan ports ; others might be com-
pelled to dangerous expeditions.” All this time
the gaol-fever was carrying off its victims by hun-
dreds. Yet the process was not quick enough.
Mr. Eden was the first to announce the approval
of the Botany Bay scheme.
• « •
There was one other suggestion made
■which deserves mention. Australia, which escaped
from China by a tidal wave, and from the legen-
dary Chinese explorer by the foresight of that
astute navigator, was again placed under offer to
the Brother of the Sun. A pamphlet, published
in 1785, recommended that the American loyalists,
who still cherished tho Imperial connection, might
be transferred there. Prison labour was to be
placed at their disposal; but—“the settlers of
New South Wales are principally to be collected
from the Friendly Isles and China ; and the
natives, no doubt, may in time be brought to
unite In this society,” History repeats itself.
There is a class in Australia to-day which still
cherishes the Imperial connection like the Ameri-
can loyalists, and which would gladly stamp out
the Democratic element by drastic legislation, or
clear the way by a “ whiff of grape ” for the docile
Chinese cheap labour which might in time “ be
brought to unite in this society.” But this scheme
would not include the natives —aboriginal, or
otherwise.
# * *
Once this question of locality was decided,
the preparations were soon made. Yiscount Syd-
ney, who was Secretary of State for the Colonies,
ordered a convoy and transports to be got ready.
On April 27, 1787, Captain Phillip received his
commission. In March the ships began to rendez-
vous at Spithead. On May 13 they hoisted sail.
The fleet consisted of a frigate and an armed
tender, six transport?, and three store-ships. It
carried 1015 persons—l 97 marines, 28 women, 17
children ; 558 male convicts, 192 women, 18 child-
ren ; and five controlling officers. The voyage
cccupied eight months. Some estimate of the
forethought lavished on the enterprise may be
gathered from the fact that forty convicts died on
the passage and within the first five months cf
settlement twenty-eight more followed them;
while sixty-six were under medical treatment,
and two hundred were unable to work. But, as
Mr Bden would have said, these unhappy
wretches were fair subjects for hazardous experi-
ment, and the overcharged British gaols had to be
relieved.
* * *
Arthur Phillip was the son of Jacob Phillip,
of Frankfort, who had emigrated to London, and
there earned a precarious subsistence as a teacher
of langu ges. His son entered the navy at sixteen,
and five years after was at the taking of Havan-
nsh in 1761. Here he was made lieutenant, and
post-captain twenty years later. He saw service
in the French war, in the Bast Indies, and in the
employ of Portugal. A somewhat left-handed
testimonial to his fitness for his new duties was
borne by Lord Howe when his appointment
was under distussion. “I cannot say the little
knowledge I have of Captain Phillip would have
led me to select him for a service of this complicated
nature.” This eulogium
appears to have com.
pletely established his
fitness as a subject for
hazardous experiments.
His commission was at
once made out. He
laid in a private pro-
vision of two puncheons
of rum and twenty cwt.
of loaf - sugar, with
ranch port and porter,
and many deranters
and glasses—the official
record amply bears out
his care in this particu-
lar—and was soon as
ready to colonise a con-
tinent as he had been
to take troops to India
1o fight the French,
or to offer his sword
to Portugal. There was
no weak prejudice or
delicate coyness about
Captain Phillip.
* *
Captain Phillip was
a man with views. In
his blander moments—
before he started, be it
observed —he appears
to have formed an idea
that the expedition he
was about to lead was a
species of prolonged
camp-meeting, flavour-
ed with an airy soupom
of the Sunday-school
picnic. “ During the
passage,” he says In
onelette*, *'l shall visit
the transports when
light airs or calms per-
mit, to see that they
are kept clean and re-
ceive the allowance
ordered by Government,
and at these times shall
endeavour to make
them sensible of their
situation.” His plans
for the future were
quaint to the verge of
the grotesque. ‘‘The
women in general,” he
went on, “ I shall sup-
pose possess neither virtue nor beauty.” This
is most ingenuously frank. But such a state
of things presented no difficulty to Phillip.
“It may he best if the most abandoned
are permitted to receive the visits of the
convicts in the limits assigned them at
certain hoars ; the rest I should keep apart by
permitting the men to he in their company when
not at work. They will, I suppose, marry." Such
was the pastoral Arcadia that the first Governor
had in his mind's eye—an island valley of Hilion,
as it were, full of bowery hollows crowded with
lawny leas where never wind blew loudly, with
gentle shepherds ever piping as though they never
would grow old. The vision of the impossible
creatures who dreamt of being seated for their
lives on a bed of roses was about to be realised.
“ There shall be no slavery in a free land,” wrote
the future Governor, “ and, consequently, no
slaves." But Captain Phillip naturally did not
know as much of the history of Botany Bay as he
afterwards learnt. In the meantime, the extracts
will serve to show what the original intentions
really were.
* * *
The Governor reached Botany Bay first,
on January 18, 1788. The rest of the fleet came
up by the 20th. Phillip showed his good sense by
preferring Port Jackson to Botany Bay as the
cradle of the settlement. On the 26th all the ships
came round and disembarked their cargoes
at the mouth of the tank-stream. Like Phillip’s
plans, this has since degenerated, and become the
city sewer. Three royal salutes were fired, the
echoes of which will not cease to be heard until
the war-ships, for which the Parliaments of the
Australian colonies now invite the people to pay a
subsidy, salute the Australian flag before they
finally sail forth from Australian waters. Every
man then received a pint of rum, and every
woman half-a-pint. A whirl of festivity ensued,
and the first Australian sun went down in peace-
ful summer splendour on a human hell. The
saturnalian orgie had commenced, and one of the
blackest chapters in the world's history was fairly
opened. The curtain rose on a new continent,
under circumstances of squalor and degradation
which never in all history had inaugurated the
career of a nation before. As we hastily cover
up and huddle away the historical picture that
shows us the close of the first Australian day, and
the pioneers that Britain sent us, sunk in their
loathsome revelry, wo find it almost impossible to
realise, as Mr. Kingsley would have us believe,
that Providence designed (he country for these.

Parkes and Co. hope, with the aid of their
pig -vote majority in the N S.W. Parliament, to
get the name of New South Wales changed to
“ Australia." This scheme, which will naturally
be most offensive to the other Australian colonies,
is no doubt regarded by the Imperialistic party,
including the present N.S.W. Government, as an
excellent means whereby to still further widen
the existing breach between New South Wales
and Victoria, and thus repress any tendency to
federation on an independent Australian basis.
Coming simultaneously with th§ CJ
place Australia at the mercy of a' reign navy, to
be partly maintained out of onr own coffers, this
proposal is especially significant. The truth is
that when he aims at originality Parkes makes a
fool of himself. He is only on safe ground while
he continues to prig the tested ideas of other
people. Let us hope that this latest deliberate
attempt to make badjjlood between the Australias
will be suffocated oy being sat on. Parkes’
poverty of resources pitiful. Why does’nt he
re christen this c-9 ay “ Hingland ” ?


HUMAM RECKLESSNESS.
A singular feature in the make up of mankind
is the recklessness of life, which at times becomes
epidemic. Some foolhardy man sets the example,
as did Webb in his attempt to swim the rapids of
Niagara Falb, and immediately he has f llowers
the worldover whoßattempt dangerous feats from
which no benefit,pecuniaryorotherwlEe caneasue.
But recklessness of life is not confined alone to this
class of people. Weareall of us daily encountering
a danger of far greater magnitude, which conceal-
ment for a time robs of Us terrors. It is so in*
sidious in its approach, fastening itself with a
deadly grip on the body be’Oie any palpable
evidence is exhibited that the vitality is sapped,
our constitutions undermined, and we are made
wrecks, physically and mentally, before we have
besn alarmed. We refer to diseases of the kidneys,
those subtle organs placed in our body to purify
our blood, and in connection with our bowels, to
eliminate all the waste material which the system
is dally throwing off. Dr. Dawson Williams says
urinai y diseases are becoming year by year more
common, and another eminent authority says that
deranged kidney action is the cause of 93 par cent,
if all the diseases which afflict mankind. Dr.
Ralte makes a still more astonishing statement,
to the effect that if the water of people who
suffer from general disease was examined, 27 per
esnt. would be found to contain albumen. This is
a startling statement, and confirms the fact
that nearly every disease takes its origin from
derangement of the kidneys. That the disease Is
and has been on the increase since the time of
Bright cannot be doubted, but that it has become
as prevalent as these statements lead us to believe
seems almost impossible, and the assertions might
well be doubted did they not come from such
high authority. The moral Is a plain one, and is
simply this: To have uninterrupted health and
long life we must keep the kidneys In such a con-
dition that they can perform the laborious func-
tion nature designed for them. How to do this is
a question which for years we have looked in vain
for physicians to answer. Their endeavours to
discover a medicine which should have a control-
ling influence to prevent these disastrous results
have been fruitless But there is a remedy,
purely vegetable, which is almost specific in its
power over the kidneys, liver, and urinary organs.
This remedy is Warner’s safe cure. It has a
record with which no others can com-
pare, and its marvellous power over disease is
confirmed by a mass of evidence given daily by
the colonial press.

sound promising, and it c ills up old recollections
which we would rather not think about. The pre-
sent scribe had a partneronce ou the goldfields who
disappeared mysteriously, leaving him his heir,
executor, and assign. This did not matter much
in itself, but one day an obtrusive lout came down
the shaft, and, in a dark corner, he stepped on
something soft, which he declared to be the
missing partner. He went up, and told other
people about it, and a prejudice arose
which led us to clear out. At Sydney Criterion

“ The Red Lamp,” now in its last week at
Sydney Royal, is a sad example of perverted
plagiarism. All its strength is derived from Step-
niak’s“ Underground Russia,” but the playwright,
to satisfy the ideas of poetical justice entertained
by the dress-circle, distorts tbe facts of history to
preserve the life of a— — Czar. The drama is a
pitiful pandering to caste prejudice, simply be-
cause, now, the stage, like the Press, has become
the mere creature c£ Capital. The American
iournalist in the “ Red Lamp," whose family
probably made a fortune pig killing in Chicago, is
a prig of the first water. In the first act he
preaches revolution, and in the second refuses to
take the hand of the magnificent enthusiast.
Prince Alexis, atd informs Zazgulicthat the name
of his country—America—in his (Zazgullc’s)
mouth makes him shudder. This, in the face of
the fact that Washington was a rebel who had
Major Andr6 shot, and would himself have
probably been hanged had the English caught
him. Had English repression of the American
colonists been like Russian repression in the Czar s
dominions, the result would have been the same.
Then there is a General who puts the Czar before
his wife in his affections. This is the morality
of the modern drama. Prince Alexia, be-
cause he Is sincere, is a dreamer. Zazgnllc,
because he is clever. Is a scoundrel. In the last
act the Czar’s life Is saved at the cost of the
Prince Alexis 5 , and the latter’s sister hypocriti-
cally triumphs over her natural affection with the
phrase “ For Russia;! ” Her husband held his duty
to the Czar before his love for his wife, and she, in
turn, glories in the sacrifice of the brother she
pretends to love on the altar of autocracy. The
great fault of the present representation is that
nearly every character endeavours to speak
broken English, The French maid speaks not
the broken Russian of a French woman trying to
express herself Jn Russian, but the broken English
of a French woman trying to express herself in
English Her auditor, who is a Russian epurtier,
would assuredly have addressed her in French.
Mr. H. H, Vincent, who plays s?azgulic, a talented
and brilliant journalist, speaks with a painful
foreign accent. Mr. Vincent once played John
Ramirez, a Spanish half-breed, in “ New Babylon,”
and the curse clicga to him yet. He gave us the
same character in “Jim the Penman,” and we
are nearly tired of his broken-down Mexican
verbalisms

It was at Sydney Criterion,the other night,
and we had taken a back seat to witness ‘ Oym-

He slumbered peacefully throughout the piece,
except at two points—the bed scene, where Essie
Jenyns, attired only in the snowy robes of night,
reclines serapbioally on her downy couch, and the
concluding ceremonial wherein sundry heroes are
made C M.G.s, or something similar. Those
fetched him.

George Darrell haa burst into blossom
again at Melbourne Royal in his familiar fonr-act
thriller “ The Sunny South.” The interests of
George and his dramas are so peculiarly wrapped
U P together that one can’t picture them apart;
therefore, it is mere vanity to conjecture what
might have been if the anthor-aotor-manager had
written something without the one grand purpose
of keeping himself in the foreground right away
through. Or If George had estimated his strength
like Henry Richard, and said—“ Since I cannot
play the lover to entertain these fair, well-spoken
days, I am determined to prove a villain "—then
we might have seen the curtain fall on vice
triumphant, and virtue down on its luck. If
the “ Sunny South” terminated like that, and the
plot included a few C.M G’s, a “distinguished
visitor,” and a “ disgraceful scene in the House,”
we might pass it as a representative Aus-
tralian drama, but at present it lacks local
colour. The company supporting Mr. Darrell is
good enough for the work, two blood-stained ruf-
fians who carry off the gyrul being about as
desperately wicked as they make ’em. That
gyrul Babs falls to the lot of the author’s very
particular relative, Miss Christian Darrell. The
lady is still fresh and verdant in her business, but
promises to improve with age after the custom of
her delightful sex. Humph! There was a deso-
lated dress-circle and densely-populated galleries
for Saturday’s performance, and the gods did
furiously rage because some “rag” wasn’t
* ‘ hup ” high enough.

If Parkes keeps his word he will have something
more valuable than his good name to leave bio
children. This reminds us of an incident in the
prosecution of Hobne Tookk. Lord Eldon, the
Attorney-General, having occasion to defend his
personal character, declared it was his most
valued possession, and all he had to leave his chil-
dren. Here he paused while he wept copiously,
seeing which the Solicitor General followed suit.
Someone then asked Horne Tookk why Milfqrd

somewhat the lip-baokers of so-called favorites

ho wisely secured the specific before recommend-

Pepper
and
Salt
A certain Dr. Peebles — more power to his
(prescriptions ! —has sketched out a simple system
5f living for a hundred years and gliding down
the hill of life gracefully. The doctor, mind you,
imposes no ridiculous conditions on his disciples.
At a first glance some of them appear stiff, but
that impression wears off with study. For in-
stance, he softens the ordeal of rising at five in
the morning by allowing you to take as much
sleep as you want. That’s plain and straightfor-
ward. You toddle off to bed with the roosters
and rise with their introductory crow. To live on
vegetables and light refreshments of the tapioca
family (washed down by nothing but filtered
water) reads pleasant enough for everyone but the
butchers and grog-sellers. The chief trouble lies
in this paragraph : “ Don’t insult Nature. If you
get angry, take a bath and go to bed and sleep ; if
the world abuses yon take extra sleep; if dyspep-
tic and discontented take a long, sound sleep, and,
waking, you will find all the world is smiling."
As far as we can understand, Dr. Peebles only
provides for anger in houses where the bath is
ready to hand and the bedroom adjoins. The man
who loses his temper out in the bush is placed at
a disadvantage. We once asked a Queensland
editor in an almost waterless district how he
managed to live there all tho year round without
tubbing. “Oh,” he airily replied, “I take a
Turkish bath whenever I go down to Melbourne.”
He was the man who once, years ago, left
Riverina for Melbourne and went to Hosie’s
baths, and when they had shampooed
him for two hours they found that his
cuticle was growing over an Irish frieze
ulster. But there are no difficulties about
the final clause: “Exercise charity towards all,
control your passions, govern your appetites.
Develope and manifest a sweet and peaceful
spirit.” That’s the lot. And now for a song,
after which a shower-bath and long, sound sleep—
(Slow.)
The Baptist Association of Victoria met in
Melbourne lately to consider matters calmly. The
chairman said he was sorry to have to state that
there had been a “ declension ”in the church
during the last year. Also, that “there were not
more than half-a-dozen—but there was that
number—clergymen in the Baptist denomination
who did not hold the doctrine of future punish-
ment." Half-a-dozen who disbelieve in Hell, and
he is surprised at the “ declension ” in the Church !
Why—but let us mould it in metre :
We ask you this .—Now, ponder well,
And answer free—
If nobody believed in Hell
Where would you be ?

A little obituary lyric from the Melbourne
Age
“ We’ve lost our little Thomas now,
The Lord carried him home;
He lent him to us for a while—
A sacred, precious loan."
Pray, pardon our hardheartedness, but we really
must suggest, as a continuation, in the same com-
mercial style:—
We watched him lying calm and still—
We only thought he dozed—
Death had a mortgage on him, and
We found he had foreclosed.
Some persons whose heads are properly
screwed on have inaugurated a little enterprise
in Victoria, Which will doubtless enable them to
organise a respectable obesity and a largo t-nk-
account in peace and quiet, whilst less brainy in-
dividuals are working themselves to skin and
hair in order to be able to buy cheap chops and
keep abreast of the refit-collector. The persons
hereinbefore alluded to have resolved themselves
into a holy, prayerful syndicate with one eye (the
glass one) fixed on heaven, and the other glued to
the main chance like an old man mussel to a pier-
pile. They have purchased a tract of verdant
country, bounded on the north by a rippling lake
and on the south by the dark and deep blue ocean,
in the peaceful bucolic region called Drysdale ;
they have split it into allotments, blocks, and
corner lots, christened it New Jerusalem, or
Golden Shore, or something, and advertised that
they stand prepared to sell to the sanctified for
cash, or on easy terms, one or more blocks in this
well-known and rapidly-improving district,
within ten minutes’ • walk of the post office,
hospital, and the morgue, and commanding an
extensive view of over the way and round the
comer. ‘ ‘ The aim of the promoters," says that fervid
organ, the Wesleyan Spectator, “ is to provide
a summer retreat for Christian people.” Two
hundred Methodist clergymen and laymen have
secured lots. Religious services will be regularly
held during the season, reserves for which pur-
pose are duly specified on the plans. No pubs
will be allowed in the streets of the holy city, and
any man whose breath is burdened with fer-
mented or spirituous odours, trespassing within
A NECESSARY PROVISO.
“MAY I TAKE MY DOG INTO THE CARRIAGE WITH ME, GUARD?"
“YES, SOR; THAT WILL BE ALL RIGHT SO LONG AS THERE’S ONLY TWO OF YEZ

its confines, will find himself liable to so many
pains and penalties that he’ll want to die on the
spot to save law-expenses. Every applicant for a
frontage must be possessed of a blue ribbon and a
family Bible ; must be able to pray off-hand, and
sing a hymn with becoming unction ; his charac-
ter must be up to standard—more than three de-
falcations and four fraudulent insolvencies unfit-
ting an applicant from becoming a citizen.
Corner lots reserved for clergymen, and a liberal
discount allowed to bishops and shining lights.
We have not been requested to give our opinion,
but we’ll give it all the same—we’d give more to
help on such a cause. We think this new float is a
glorious, philanthropic idea; some lonely, faraway
place where ranters and sleek apostles could get
to out of the road has long been a hard felt want.
We think the enterprising genius who opens a
pub. just beyond the border of the New Jeru-
salem will find his business go ahead so fast that
he won’t be able to keep his hat on, and we also
think that this holy city will produce more
divorce cases to the acre than any other spot its
s'ze under the sun.

After all, what is the good of a tombstone ?
No man that we ever knew of slept any happier in
his grave beneath the vine on account of the lies
above his head ; the stone doesn’t hold down the
lost cadaver worth a cent,, and the granite monu-
ment is a mighty life at the resurrection. Yet
men keep on planting headstones with the same
aggravated stupidity as of old, and while the de-
parted member of the Australian eleven is still
pounding with his bat at the golden gate his sor-
rowing relatives are engaged carving out on the
flat bosom of a melancholy block how many runs
he made in his earthly cricket-match, and how
death bowled him out at last and he passed away,
for ever stumped. Men, as we already observed,
keep on planting tombstones, and other men dig
them up. and scoop them out, and turn them into
hog-troughs. Years ago there was a little grave-
yard in a lonely spot near the Victorian border,
and half a dozen monuments related how the
mderneath was speared by the blacks in forgotten
years, and how he died through the gore coming
out of him It was a poor, hungry, lop-sided, in-
solvent little cemetery, and it mouldered away

lone In Memoriam” andturned itinto a grindstone.
It is still in use, and day by day “ Sacred to the
memory of ” goes whizzing round, and axes
and knives are sharpened on the virtues of the
deceased. “Erected by his sorrowing wife ” has
long since been ground to dust; “Blessed are
they that sleep in the Lord” was chipped away
when the old stone was rooted up and devoted to
its new service, but still that “Sacred to the
memory of ” whirls about with a monotonous
buzz from morning to night. If this should catch
the eye of old w ugg, he will take the hint
and give the relic a rest. If he doesn’t

You would last a hundred years,

If you really want to be a centenarian—
Never taste a bit of meat,
But farinaceous vittles eat,
Or mix ’em with a diet vegetarian.
Sure, the only way to thrive
Is to quit your couch at five.
When the early morning air is very breezy ;
If much slumber you require,
At seven sharp to rest retire—
Then getting up at five is pretty easy.
Wine and spirits, beer, and such—
No, nor tea nor coffee touch—
Those liquors interfere with your longevity ;
When you feel inclined to weep,
Go and take a soothing sleep,
And waken in a state of happy levity.
If a fellow makes you wroth.
Run at once and have a bath,
Then tumble in and doze away an hour ;
Nature is insulted if
Anyone presumes to tiff,
And afterwards forgets to try a shower.
Love your neighbour as yourself.
Put all “ feelings ” on the shelf.
And govern every appetite and passion,
Then you’ll live three hundred years—
Bless us I how the prospect cheers—
Centenarians are sure to be the fashion.
OUR GODS—AT CENTENNIAL TIME.
We, like the ancient Greeks,
Bow at many a shrine
Where reason vainly seeks
For aught divine.
They deified as gods
Statues of pulseless stone ;
We worship soulless clods
Of brawn and bone.
Muscle is all we heed,
Brute force has trampled mind ;
Swift rush of boat or steed
Leaves brain behind
The one who wins renown
In schools of art and grace
Must yield the laurel crown
To Beach, or Mace.
Men in the older days
Honoured both song and sage ;
Low brows receive our bays
In this new age.
Brain begs in soleless shoes ;
Art dies, and brazen clods—
Gross things of busts and thews—
Rise as dur gods.
BLISS, INDEED!
We whitened with terror and shook at the kqees—
The Bulletin’s thoughts were far over the seas
While the Angel of Death roundabout our Louise
And her sister maliciously hovered ;
For the measles is such a malignant disease;
But now we are happy again, if you please,
And chirrup like dickey-birds up on the trees—
Those maidens, hurrah ! have recovered.
The editor suffered with spasms of dread,
The office-boy hung his young carrotty head,
And (so says his mother) refused to be fed,
The ariists wept oft at their easels,
When Louie and Maudie were ordered to bed,
With faces disfigured by patches of red
It seemed they must certainly die, but instead,
Thank Jove 1 they’ve got over the measles.
Mister Walker, legislator,
In his airy way complains
That the Biloela matron
Beats her naughty girls with canes.
Well, our captious friend 1 What would you
Have the worthy matron use ?
Would you have her burst her slippers ?
Or the matron’s husband’s shoes ?
We admit that methods differ,
And that efficacious pains
May be to naughty girls applied
By other means than canes.
Such matters as a cricket-bat —
The flat end of a spade—
A cowhide—or a saveloy
Have naughty girls dismayed
Before—and even yards of tripe
And tails of kangaroos
Have served the purpose—you perceive
The range is wide to choose.
Artistic bent will go for much
In such a case as th's -
For bold and picturesque effect
A spade is not amiss.
But, all the same, we don’t see why
This captious wretch complains
That tho Biloela matron
Castigates her girls with oanes.
0 ur faith in institutions—
In our charitable schemes—
Has vanished with the last report,
Into the land of dreams.
Since that repoit has been hushed up
Or gone to feed the fishes ;
Why should the matron not use canes,
Or half-bricks—if she wishes ?
"SONGS OF THE ARMY OF THE
NIGHT."
Herewith we introduce a few poems-now first
printed—selected at random from a
to be published In Sydney within tte n 2?
few weeks by Francis W. L. Adams
a volume filled with the strong mear
poetry—such poetry as is seldom the lot of man
to read. Too long have poets given their C,?
thoughts to gild frivolity and to refine the W
than moonbeams of fancy. Too lore hava ip
sported “with Amwyllls in the shade and
wi'h the tangles of Ne sera's hair”; but seldom
has imagination thrown its vivid light cn tho
misery of men and chanted their wrorgs in h, r
fervid verse. At best, in Wordsworth it waii«
feebly of “ man’s inhumanity to mar ’’ and re
turns to its Egyptian flesh-pot to feed and hi
fribble with the trifles that gratify the palate of
fools. These poems of Francis Adams’ are nas
sionate and intense. They throb with love f r
humanity and hate for humanity’s oppressors
Here we have poetry seizing hold of life Ko lnz
down to the bed-rock of society and holding alofb
the quivering organism to the gaze of startled
men and women. In these poems the author
applies realism in impassioned verse, and plain
nervous, unvarnished Saxon, to problems usually
relegated to the domain of crabbed and dry-as
dust philosophy. He throws all his forca into show
ing things as they are, and not as most poets do
as he would wish them to be. We want this
volume to boom throughout the land. If it -were
called the “Beauteous Terrorist,” and were
written by Sir Henry Parkes, we should wish no
less. Not alone for the sake of its author, butfor the
sake of the book, we want every man and woman
in whose breast beats a sympathising human heart
to read it. There are possibly better poems than
those we have selected—our choice having been
restricted by circumstances to the first few pages-
—we can only advise everyone who reads them to
buy and study the volume :
EVENING HYMN IN THE HOVELS,
We sow the fertile seed, and then we reap it •
We thresh the golden grain; we knead the’bread
Others that eat are glad. In store they keep it
While we hunger outside with hearts like lead.
Hallelujah'!
We hew the stone and saw it, rear the city.
Others inhabit there in pleasant ease.
We have no thing to ask of them save pity,
No answer they to give but what they please. ■
Hallelujah !
Is it for ever, fathers, say, and mothers,
That we must toil and never know the light '■
Is it for ever, sisters, say, and brothers,
That they must grind us dead here in the night?
Hallelujah /
O we whs sow, reap, knead, shall we not also
Have strength and pleasure of the food we make 5
O we who hew, build, deck, shall we not also
The happiness that we have given partake?
Hallelujah !

willing to plank their coin if they once found
that the vice-regal smile, like everything else in
this world worth having, was a marketable com-
modity at so much per yard. According to the
amusement advertisement columns of the Sydney
papers, Lord Carington has taken under his im-

dropped out of sight. Rumour asserts
that part of the public subscription

a forged cheque traded off by Stanley
on a city hotelkeeper, and the rest—

It was a refreshing experience, and several times
it seemed likely that the old hearse would hit up
against a tree, but it did not, and the tuneful
Tasmanian and her auxiliaries are saved to us
The trouble arose In consequence of the brakes re-
fusing to act, and, according to the Southern
Argus, when level ground was reached in safety,
to guard against a repetition of the skedaddle,
Miss Sherwin took off her expensive kid boots and
handed them over to be placed on the brake-

Here is a weird story. A Stipen-
diary Magistrate having been detected cheating at
cards at a swell club, found it expedient to resign
to avoid the degradation of dismissal. Now his
Washup had been very popular with the diggers,
from the fact that he was a “ real good sort, and
had winked at their disregard of various portions ot
the min ng regulations. A few of the leading
spirits met to consider the situation. An en-
thusiastic admirer of the fallen dignitary was for
pas sic g a resolution that in the opinion of the
meeting there was nothing very heinous in sitting
on an ace of spades ; but the sense of the majority
was that some more drastic action was necessary.
It happened that the Magistrate had one enemy,
a lawyer, who it was believed had acquainted the
Minister of Justice with the circumstances of the
card-sharping incident, and after a lengthy dis-
cussion it was decided that on the gentleman of
the long robe the vengeance of the meeting should
fall. Assassination was the punishment agreed
on, and four fine fellows were told off to do the
job. The unfortunate lawyer was accordingly
waylaid, bludgeoned with a pick-handle, and left
for dead on the roadside. He recovered, however,
and soon after left the district.

That humane association of gentle fanatics
(worthy to be ranked with the Field Naturalists)
the Vegetarian Society of Australia, gave a great
leguminous banquet in Melbourne the other night.
The menu was remarkable. You could have a
preparation of anything that grows by calling for
it. Patties of green peas, parsnip pie, pumpkin
steaks, sausages of chopped herbs, and eggs done
up in the skins of young onions, tomatoes with
garlic sauce—these were the commonest things
on the board. la was a mighty feast. After it
■ was over and the guests had risen up like so many
Nebuchadnezzira refreshed, an adjournment was
made to another hall where Miss Fanny E. Samuel
gave a brief address in which she told the company
that “ if they went immediately from flesh to vege-
tarian diet it would be injurious. The change
must be gradual, because if done at once their
bodies would rapidly fall away and they would
not be equal to it.” Miss Samuels accompanied
this statement with the artless admission that she
herself had not been precipitate in her change
from red to green diet. She was not yet by any
means a strict vegetarian. Here the company
smiled as who should say, “ This is good, sappy
humour; there is something of the leek stew
with a sprinkling of the mustard and cress about
this.” Then the meeting broke up and went out
into the streets carrying with them a pleasant
kitchen-garden flavour that lingered behind them
long after they had gone.

A curious old Otago settler, reputed to be
enormously wealthy, “pegged out” a few weeks
ago, leaving his earthly possessions to his only
child—a maiden daughter of some forty summers.
Living in a remote mining district where women
were scarce and “hatters ” plentiful, the daughter
had several suitors, but the old man, who wanted
to save the wages of a servant girl, always
managed to shoo them off with bad language, old
boots, an ugly dog, and other arguments.
When at last he had been duly planted
ia the local resurrection-paddock the sui-
tors gathered courage, made friends with the
dog, and renewed their attentions to the discon-
solate orphan. At this juncture, while the
neighbouring settlers were trying to figure up
how many thousands the girl was worth and the
suitors were spending money in hair-oil and con-
versation-lozenges, a dainty young clergyman—a
new arrival in the district, who had dreamt
dreams of wedded bliss and a big farm—came to
administer the consolations of religion to the
fatherless one and warn the poor thing against
the temptations of the world and the danger of
being led away by the mercenary and nnsanctifled.
To save her from any unholy alliance, the man of
many prayers offered himself up as a holocaust on
the altar of her affections, so to speak, and in a
very short time they were made one, dear
brethren, and would have been happy ever after-
wards but for another hitch which, alas, even-
tuated to mar their felicity. Sad to say, the old
man’s estate did not cut up well. His liabilities
exceeded his assets, and the holy young cleric
found himself the husband of an heiress who In-
herited by her father’s will some hundreds of
debts, with neither youth, beauty, education,
nor manners as a set-off. The old rivals have
teased to envy him.

At a fancy-dress ball given last week by a

It is related of a certain well-advertised
colonial “dramatic author” that upon one occa-
sion he visited one of Her Gracious’ gaols in com-
pany with an actress. During their round of
iaspection they observed one particularly good-
looking young prisoner, and the actress became
anxious to know what he had been imprisoned
for. The author questioned the prisoner on the
point, who, in response, and smiling hideously,
said: “I am here for killing less people in the
world than you have done with your pieces.”

H. E. A. Allan, who died suddenly the
other evening at a church-meeting in Sydney,
was one of those few men one meets who acted
np to the motto, “ Deeds, not words.” His cut-
ward bearing was unostentatious to a degree, his
deeds of charity were thorough, and were known
to few save medical men and the sick poor. He
denied himself that he might give more to others,
la contradistinction to the great majority of rich
men, he waited and gave away sovereigns, in-
stead of driving and giving shillings. He drank
no wine, but gave plenty to the sick. He has
been known to make up a set of books after office
hours in his own house, for a clerk who was ill
*nd unable to work; and he never once, in the
c urse of his long life, turned his back upon
human suffering. He died a bachelor, and in his
' ase, as in that of few others in this age of alleged
Christianity, the goed that he has done is not fn*
terred with his bones.

serve nine months in Geelong Gaol, just for form’s
sake. It must be nice for a fashionable prisoner
to find that his efforts to do the thing in style are
duly appreciated : it gives him heart, and he will
never descend to perpetrate a low theft. It does
away with the temptation which might lead him
to steal a leg of mutton or a loaf of bread, and
thus get into great trouble, and stain the family

Miss Fay was driving a good trade as a
“medium” till the spirits moved her to hold a
seance at Blackburn (Eng.) The show hummed
along in a ghostly kind of way up to a certain

terminated with the meeting chucking Miss Fay’s

would hold up a pair of
stockings before the dis-

were too far gone to be worth half-soleing, or if it
would be better to cut the leg off one and join it
to the foot of the other. Then he would set to

a little song while inking the bare spots on his

Our cable news this morning informs ua that another of
the daughters of the Prince of Wales has made acquaintance
with the measles epidemic. It is to be hoped, for the sake
of their swee s lady mother —“lady mother is good—the
much-beloved Princess of Wahs, that tbe attack will be a
slight one, and soon pass away, leaving no serious dimeu ty
in its wake. The effect of having measles in the family
must awake old m’murhs in the mind of Albert Edward,
who wrote a kiad letter of sympahy to the once cell orated
Lady Mordaunt upon the occasion of measles making their
appearance on her ladyship. H“ c mdoled with her in her
misfortune, and said he had a vivid recollection of the time
when he was laid up with that troublesome complaint. Just
before Lady Mordaunt was attacked by that complaint she
worked with her own fair hands a pair of pretty wool e •
tnuffiateea for IPs Highness, who doubtless has kept them as
a memento of that lady s interesting illness."
In the dictionary of grovel, when Lady Mordaunt,
of shady reputation, gets the meashs, it ia an
“interesting illners." but let Mrs. Brown’s baby
catch it from her and it is only “a common brat com-

The gianis of Genesis are being planed
down to very small dimensions. An antiquary
has just demonstrated that the Britons of 2000
years ago averaged sft. 2in for males, and 4ft,
lOin. for females, and the further hack the in-
vestigation goes the smaller the human race
becomes. It is calculated that under the
strengthening influence of three square meals per
day the stature of men is increasing at the rate of
iRn, per thousand years. The British aristocracy
is growing faster than this average, but then it
has nothing else to do. The House of Lords and
the naked Patagonians are new about the tallest
and the moat brainless of mankind.

“ Jehude ” writes “In a recent issue of
The Bulletin you say that ‘out of the 47,000
Jews in London, no fewer than 14,350 received
aid last year.’ This is probably true; but it
would be interesting to know how much of this
aid came from Christians. Jews are generally
liberal subscribers to Christian works of charity,
but the Christians are not so ready to reciprocate.
There is another side to the picture, however.
The lowest estimate of the annual income of the
London Jews is £3,808,430, which gives £B2 per
head for 47,000 persons. The average Income of
the native population of the United Kingdom is
only £35, so that the Jews are two and one-half
times richer than the Gentiles. It is estimated
that 100 Jewish families in London have an in-
come of over £lO,OOO ; 1400 f unifies an income of
over £lOOO, and 800 an income of over £5OO. Men
with incomes ot over £lO,OOO a year are twenty
times as numerous among London Jews as among
London Gentiles ; men with over £lOOO a year are
nearly seventeen times as numerous, and men
with over £5OO a year are nearly six times as
numerous. This proves that wa Jaws are still
rich, and there is no necessity for the Lion of
Judah to prop himself up against a fence before
ho attempts to roar just at present ”

We have received the following from N.Z. :
Dear Bulletin —The following villainous case in the N Z.
Courts may show you that even the N S.W. Divorce Bill
wants something to make it complete. A husband sued for
divorce from his wife < n the ground of adultery, and hy dint
of various things obtained a three-fourths verdict and a
decree nisi. He was thus freed from all obligation to sup-
port bis wife, whose only crime is that the hubby is tired of
her, but for three years he has refused to apply for his decree
absolute, and thus set her at libe-ty to marry again. The co-
respondent, who was an old friend, would marry her and
provide he- with a home if he had the opportunity, hut her
affectionate husband finds amusement in the position bv
: which she is neither wife, divorcee, nor widow, ana leaves her
i to starve in her enforced homelessness. The judge marked his
i opinion of the verdict by giving the wife the custody of the
three children, and they also share in their mothers misery.
I And the law, which blasted an innocent woman's character
and cast the co-respondent in heavy damages, has no
power to compel the husband to complete his case and
set his wife free. In view of this and other cases of the
like description do you not think divorce laws require
reform? In their present form they are simply an agency by
which a contemptible person gets rid of his wrfe and children,
raises the wind in damages by atrocious lying, and then wreak s
a life-long revenge on his unhappy victims. Is this justice 1
—Yours, &c., Maoeilandkr (worse luck.)
The foregoing, though a purely cx-parte state-
ment, sets forth a condition of things which is
perfectly conceivable under the present law.
Our correspondent’s letter is here printed purely
on general grounds.

John Benjamin Binns, an ex-hangman, is

prices are moderate, and good biz repays the
efforts o! the gifted management. Could not
John B. Binns be bribed to fetch his properties to
Australia, and take part ia the Centennial cele-
brations, giving nightly free exhibitions for
adults only, and Saturday afternoon matinees for
the children? This, we think, would give the
populace a comprehensive grip of one of the
nob’est and most cherished institutions of New

Hosie’s Cafe, Melbourne, has just changed
hands for £85,000 cash. We remember Hosie’s first
start in the pie business, which was a very modest
affair. He was the pie-oneer of the “ Sootch pie ”
and “ scone-and-coffee” trade in Melbourne—or,
rather his wife was. The old man kept a boot-
shop in Bourke street, nearly opposite the Post-
Office, and the wife, having a little spare time on
her hands and an aptitude for making Scotch
pies, opened a small shop adjoining and modestly
put forth her “Sootch pie, 3d.,’ shingle. By
degrees the little shop was extended, and Jama*,
always with an eye to the main chance, findu g
the pies paid better than the boots, gave up hit
own trade and occupied the space with the
“ pies." A few years and the pie trade had made
Hosie comfortable, and he thought of travelling
for new ideas. He found ready purchasers for his
business in Messrs. Dillon and Burrowes, who,
however, bound him down in a heavy penalty not
to open in the “ pie ” business within one mile of
the old shop. He went to England, picked up
many attractive nic-nacs, and returned to the
colony. A large, three-storied, blue-stone store,
recently vacated by Levy Bros., was to let. It
was within six doors of his old shop. Hosie got a
long lease and walked into the old establishment
and told Dillon what he had done. “ But,” said
D., “you cannot do it— remember the penalty!’
“ Oh, well, here’s the penalty,” at the same time
planking the money in notes. In the new place
success followed on success, and to-day he sells
out one establishment for £85,000.

Senior-Sergeant Dalton, of Governor Car-
ington’s escort, writes complaining of what he
regards as some unkind remarks in re his recent
en'ertainment to the survivors of Inkerman. In
reply, we can only say that The Bulletin fully
recognised the sergeant’s kind heartedness and
liberality, and never intended to put its foot in
his eye in any malignant sense, and it observes
with regret that there is to be another dinner on
the 17th of June next, at which Sergeant Dalton
proposes to entertain bis fellow soldiers of Sir
Hugh Rose’s Central Indian compaign of 1858.
The Bulletin’s regret is based partly on the
fact that it can’t pronounce the hideous names
attached to those jaw-dislooatirg battles, and
partly on a sneaking regard for the poor Asiatic
who always got licked, and who, after all, was
merely fighting for his freedom the beat way he
knew how. The present writer, by tie way,
has a little celebration of his own on hand
in June next—the 10th anniversary of the day
when he escaped from a fathom long Chinaman
armed with a big shovel. He was on a Queens-
land goldfield at the time, and, being the
agent of a certain bloated Southern capi-
talist, he helped to own a machine-site on
a river bend. A body of Chinamen started to
tut a water-race right across it, and the writer
valiantly went up, and, grabbing the leader by the
I ig- tail, said, “ Hi! get out of this, you yellow idola-
ter.” Then the Mongol arose, six feet of him, and
solemnly heaved up a long-handled shovel and the
present sciibe fled. He came back afterwards
and argued the point with a gun, but what he
wants to celebrate is the t ime when he left so judi-
ciously and got away alive. If he can find the China-
man he will invite him to dinner on that anniversary,
and the shovel shell be stood up in a corner as a
memento, and if he can’t find the Chinaman he
will celebrate by himself. la either case, the
shovel will be planted In the corner, with a frill
round it, and when the spread is over it will be
put away among the family plate and handed
down to succeeding generation?.

plant known.
Persons suffering from Skin Disease will find
these Bitters invaluable. Q

Port Adelaide, October 30 1886.
Gentlemen, —I ae great pleasure in recom-
mending Row’s D anelion Bitters. I have been
suffering for several years with Liver complaint,
and been under several doctors for it without any
curative result. I have only taken two bottles of
your Dandelion Bitters, and feel quite a different
man. I can, therefore, v ith truthfulness, advise
all who suffer from Liver complaint to try them,—
Yours,
O. R. UPJOHN, J.P,

Read an expression of thankfulness received by
the undersigned :
“ I have for many years been obliged to take
medicines of different kinds for affections of the
liver, Indigestion, pain in the chest, general de-
bility, feelings of nervousness, weariness, great
depression of spirits, and so on, but all without
producing any beneficial effect, till at last, being
recommended to try ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, which, happily, I find has produced an
unexpected and wonderful effect and change in
my system, and has removed from my mind the
horribly depressed feeling and former condition of
bodily ailment I have so unhappily experienced
for so many years.
“ I am glad of the opportunity to make known
the excellent qualities of ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, that those who are afflicted as I have
been may take advantage of them.

Row’s Eteane’s Wine.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. YOUNG LADIES can tak

Dear Bulletin, —I have been much struck with the
veracity of the N S W. Freetrade apostle, Pulsford, who, on
his return to Sydney,the other day, is reported by the Sydney
papers to have said : “There was no particular feeling in
Brisbane in favour of Protection “ As a matter of fact, at
his meeting here, which was poorly attended, the audience
would not listen to him at all. The value of the Brisbane
daily newspapers as leaders or exponents of public opinion
may be guaged from the fact that, although he was puffed in
preliminary pars and sub-leaders, the meeting—and, in fact,
his whole visit—was a complete fiasco, over which he must
have lost money. His lecture which, as I said before, could
not be heard in consequence cf the uproar, was reported in
extenso by the dailies, so I suppose the “ copy ” was handed
in previous to its delivery. A few nights ago Mr. King,
M.L.C., delivered an address on Protec'ion, when the Town
Hall was crammed. There are an enormous number of Pro-
tectionists in Brisbane, as will be proved at the next general
election, not far off, when “ Encouragement to Native Indus-
tries" will be the cry —Yours truly, H V.A. Brisbane, 12th
November.
The Wesleyan Missionary Society are pros-
pecting for gold in South Central Africa —this in
obedience to the command “Seek and ye shall
find.” Hut somehow or other the claims have
failed to pan out equal to Tongan cocoa- nut tree

The Orient Co. ’s splendid steamer Ormuz,
this trip dellverd her London malls at Sydney in
29 days, the shortest time on record ; and the
officers are of opinion that she can travel evn
faster still. The best day’srun was 420 miles. Every
Australian should support the Orient Company,
who employ only white labour.

The Time is come. The good Time so long pro-
phesied. BE ON GUARD, LET WATCHFUL-
NESS BE YOUR WATCHWORD. In these
days of political strife it is absolutely necessary to
keep a watch on everybody.
Keep a Watch on the Governor —
He will be none the worse for it.
Keep a Watch on Parkes—
He wants it.
Keep a Watch on Bibbs
He will be all the better for it.
Keep a Watch on the Treasurer, the Mayor, the
Bishop, the City Engineer, on the Civil Servants,
the Police and the Aldermen ; and keep a Watch
on yourself, for you are well worth watching.
This will be a gigantic task ; but it is a matter
of vital import, and it must be done.
The Waterbury Watch Company intend to help
you do it. They are now turning out complete
and perfect watches at the rate of 2000 per day
from their factory at Waterbury, Conn., which is
provided with every facility for placing and keep
ing A PERFECT WATCH on every man, woman,
and child in the world at a cost of Thirteen
Shillings and Sixpence for each person watched.
YOU CAN’T GET OYER FACTS, YOU
KNOW ; SO IT’S NO USE TRYING.
The Waterbury has been more highly spoken of
by the press all over the world than any other
watch ev r produced- Hundreds of extracts are
open for the inspection of the curious.
The Waterbury Watch is sold by all store-
keepers and dealers throughout the colony, and in
the event of accident it can be repaired at a
merely nominal cost at

CHANGEABLE WEATHER.
The veritable oldest inhabitant says he has
never seen such weather as this since the En-
deavor let go her right bower anchor in the blue
mud of Botany Bay. Variable weather, variegated
with intermissions of storm and sunshine—the
deceitful calm which lulls into security and the
tempest which provokes profanity—tests the
temper and strains the forbearance of most of the
sons of men ; but it utterly demoralises a large
percentage of those who are addicted to rheu-
matism and similar afflictions. When the foun-
tains of the great deep are opened at the rate of
about six inches per hour, and a guileless man
who has been tempted forth by a stray ten minutes
of sunshine picks himself up in the middle of the
second act far from home, and without either top-
coat or umbrella, it is then, if ever, that he may
be forgiven for quoting from the wrong authority,
or turning over two leaves at a time in his hurry
to find suitable expression for his feeling. Were
it not for the knowledge that he has a certain re-
fuge to fly to, he would be apt to give away to
despair ; but his home is never without a supply
of the great pain conqueror—St. Jacobs oil—and
he remembers it in the mldstof his denunciations,
and hurries off to the best friend humanity ever
had for the relief of all the ills that are brought
on by a thorough and unexpected wetting.
PURE WATER.
The actual value of water is known but to com-
paratively few people, certainly not to those who
live in well-provided cities where every room in
the house is fitted with a tap, and as much water
as is required can bo drawn off clear and old
whenever it is wanted. Ask the man who has
been cast away in an open boat out of sight of
land for a week without water bis opinion on the
subject; or suggest to the poor wretch who has
been lost on a trackless, waterless plain in Aus-
tralia a memory of his sufferings, and you will get
some idea of the value of the opinion expressed
by Dr. Johnson, who said that water was “ a
liquid for men to wash in and and for horses to
drink.” On the other hand, a great many very
worthy people continue to assert, in and out of
season, that pure water is the best and most
wholesome drink in the world. Perhaps it is—
for those who like it and believe they can get it
pure, and for such people the notion is a harmless
fad, which amuses them and dees nobody any
barm. But the beverage which moat faithfully
answers their description is unquestionably Clau-
sen’s New York Champagne Lager Beer, the
honest and wholesome product of pure malt and
hops. In an editorial on the subject of the
Centennial awards at Philadelphia, published in
the Brewer s Gazette of October 15, 1876, we
Audit stated that “for bottled Lager Beer Messrs.
Clausen and Son. of New York, bore off the palm.”
This refers to the First Priza and Gold Medal
which was taken over the heads of seventeen of
the biggest, strongest, and wealthiest competitors
in the world. It is not to be wondered at. there-
fore, that Clausen’s Lager leads the van in Aus-
tralia.
Not many weeks ago, Morell Mackenzie
was knighted for “ curing ” the Crown Prince of
Germany of his throat-disease, which has now
turned out to be soft cancer. It is commonly
asserted that Sir Mac.’s previous professional
reputation was won as flukily as his handle.
Apropos, some of the dailies assert that the
Crown Prince’s ma’ady is the result of smoking.
Are we to assume, then, that H.R.H. has been in
the habit of wearing a clay-pipe in his larynx ?
“I HOPE YOU WILL BE LENIENT WITH ME. YER WARSHIP,” WHINED THE
THIEF, AS HE PREPARED FOR SENTENCE; “I HAVE A GOOD MANY
DEPENDENT ON ME FOR SUPPORT.”
“CHILDREN?” INQUIRED THE BENCH.
“NO, YER WARSHIP; POLICE AND DETECTIVES.’

Professor Pearson, Victorian Minister of
Education, and one of the finest scholars this side
of the line, was speaking in the Assembly the
other night of the necessity there was that State-
school teachers should be able to teach pupils
good English, when a mocking goblin on the Oppo-
sition side interrupted him with : “ What I teach
the innocent rising generation to talk English like
hat ? (referring to Mr. Pearson’s Oxford drawl).

The Referee.
Jack Burke, “ the Irish lad,” arrived in
Sydney per s.s. Mariposa. This pugilist obtained no-
toriety throughout the “scrapping ” world through
iivaHng out five rounds against J. L. Sullivan.
This battle took place at Chicago in 1885, and the
gate money—always a large consideration in con-
nection with professional fisticuffs amounted to
17 OOOdols. “ The Lad” has also met and beaten
Kllrain, Mick Loary, and other well-known
bruisers, and altogether has taken part in 100
encounters with bare knuckles and gloves. There
is a Mrs. Jack Burke and a little one The
pugilist scales 1721 b , is 25 years of age, and is a
clean-limbed, active-looking young fellow.
• • *
Jack Burke’s objection to fight the cham-
pion Jackson on the score that the latter is black
won’t “ wash.” Burke
is not an American, but
cornea from a country
where it waa never con-
sidered infra dig. for
even a champion —which
Burke la not—to meet
a man of colour. The
mighty Cribb, after hav-
ing determined upon re-
tirement from the ring,
twice tackled and de-
feated the terrible Moly-
neaux, the black, rather
than chance the cham-
pionship going to Ame-
rica. Burke will And, as
others have done, that
reputation alone will not
draw dollars in Aus-
tralia. The Antipodeans
are “ mugs ” enough to
want to see a genuine
contest for their money,
and if Burke withdraws
his excuse and tackles
the Australian champion
we 11 bet our bottom
dollar they get It.

Old Tom Colebrook’a
hand has not lost its
cunning, as Ellis dis-
covered on Saturday
when Tom, in the Nereus,
defeated Ellis in the
Genesta, at the Balmain
Sailing Club’s race for
20 to 22-feet half-deckers.
The Hermione, an ama-
teur-built boat, ran into
third place, a good per-
formance, considering
the other starters in-
cluded the Triton, Guine-
vere, and Cynthia.

We are told that the
visit of an Australian
Eleven to England nex"i
season is to be of a purely
private character. It
must be borne in mind,
however, that a semi-
representative standing
has already b?en given
to the team in England,
it having gone forth that
they were going home
under the wing of the
trustees of the N.S.
Wales Cricket Ground,
and matches were made
with English clubs on
that understanding. As
the trip is to be made
purely for “gale,”, and
as a natural consequence,
trouble will probably arise
before the completion of
the tour, would it not be
as well, In view of the
future visit of a genuine
representative team, for
the associations of the
various colonies to ac-
quaint the home authori-
ties of the real state of
the case ? The N. S. Wales
Association, at all events,
should move in the
matter.

Tom Lees’ second
fight with Goode, in
England, ended in a
brawl. The men wore
very small gloves, and
the affair was little bet-
ter than a prize-fight.
On this occasion Lees
weighed fully a stone
heavier than his oppo
nent, and by the time
four rounds had been
gone through both men
were pretty well at a
standstill. After a couple
of minutes’ fighting in
the fifth round, there
was a misunderstanding
as to the call of time,
and the men retired to
their corners, but Goode
finding out it was not
the timekeeper who
had called “ corners,"
walked over and struck
Lees whilst on his se-
cond’s knee. The ring was then rushed, and
the referee declared a draw.

Beach always sleeps soundly the night
before a big race, and on one occasion bad to be
awakened a few minutes before the time fixed
for him to get into his boat. The late Dr. For-
tesoue used to say : “ Beach is not an ordinary
man : ho is a cold-blooded animal.”

Rush has “ half an idea ” that Hanlan
will beat Beach,

The M.C.C.’s own particular team of Eng-
lishmen played to miserable business at Ballarat
last week, but it can’t be urged against them that
they fooled with their opponents, as Shrewsbury’s
crowd do when there is no direct inducement to
work It was within three hours of the time for
drawing stumps when Ballarat went in for a first
innings, yet their wickets were lowered as relent-
lessly as though the question of victory or defeat,
was at issue. Naturally enough the locals com-
pared the “ amateurs’ ” thoroughness with the
laziness of the professionals on a former occasion,
when they excused themselves by saying that
they “wiren’tgoing ft bowl their insides out”
because there was no show of being credited with
a win. By the way, little Peel, once only thought
of as a bowler, has developed into a useful bat,
silways safe for a score against second-rates.

This was pretty “ hot.” A lot of bookies
travelling by rail from Sydney to Melbourne
started playing nap. One of the crowd was a
notorious “ dry hasher ’’—wouldn’t go three unless
he hell ace, king, queen, and never went nap by
any chance. They gob out for a drink at one
station, and the festive brethren “readied-up” a
hand for him. They dealt out to him ace, king,
queen, and knave of diamonds and the ace of
spades. They dealt to one of the others five
diamonds, calculating to get some amusement out
of their victim’s face when he went nap and got
spun by the fifth diamond bumping his ace of
spades. He came back and pondered over the
hand. The others were delighted. “Jacks
going three this time.” “ Can't go lees than four
after thinking eo long, you know." At last he
spoke. “I'll go nap.” “No fear.” “Think
again." “Don’t do anything rash,” said the
humourists. Then the victim, who saw through
the plot and knew that someone had five
diamonds, calmly led the ace of spades, making
spades trumps. Of course nobody could take It,
and nobody of the lot had a second spado to be
“ floated in on his pink ear ” on the four diamonds.
Then they explained that it was a “ have," but
he didn’t take that view of the matter, and they
all had to ante-up. A double-header too!

The Y.R.O. management has made a big
mistake in railing off the saddling end ot the
paddock and charging an extra five “bob" for
admission to the “ bii-ioage." Until last meeting
it was the Victorian's pet “blow” that a ten
shilling fee procured him a full run of the Flem-
ington show, barring only the members’ and
stewards’ stands and the Gov.’s private box. This ,
privilege was favourably commented upon to the j
disadvantage of racing arrangements In the old I
country. “ Pendragon,” of the Referee who is
particularly outspoken about the ten shillings for
this and ten shillings for that demanded from
visitors at English race-meetings, loudly praised
the Australian policy of giving the public as much
as possible for their money. Under Its old system
the V. R C prospered well. The public never
grumbled at paying an extravagantly dear rail-
way fare to Fiemington, nor did they trouble
much when an extra sixpence was tacked on to
it some three years ago. But there was
general discontent over the Birdcage in-
novation, and natura’ly so It was as
though a theatrical manager had raised his
prices in the middle of a successful ran, on the
ground that the public would stand a little more
squeezing. And this unpopular “ extra ” was re-
garded as the probable pioneer of others. Ere
long there may be an inner ring for the bookmak-
ing aristocracy, and a vice-regal enclosure where
Lady Looh and friends can promenade in exclu-
slve state. All this may (nay, surely will) coma
to pass if the Club’s first “ try-on ’’ answers In a
financial sense. Bnt it Is a significant fact that
the grand stand receipts on Cup day ehowed a
considerable falling-off from last year, which
makes it appear that the birdcage experiment
didn’t answer up to expectations. On Darby day
when people paid their stand money under the
balief that it would go as far as of yore, the at-
tendance had been larger than ever. Evidently a
case of “once bitten, twice shy,” with a gaod
few.

Billy Murdoch is practising hard in Mel-
bourne, and Intends to make a big bid for a place
in the combined team. It Is probable he will
be one of ttc next Australian Eleven should he
show anything like form.
If both now keep to
their alleged resolves,
this Saturday must prove
a fateful day for the
rival scullers, Hanlan and
Beach, the latter hav-
ing avowed that should
the race be rowed without
accident it will be his last
effort, so it is now or
never for Hanlan to re-
gain his lost laurels. On
form and paper it looks
a thousand to one on
Beach, but many believe
the Yankee who rowed
Beach on the Parramatta
was not the phenomenon
who had previously rid-
den roughshod over the
world, and it remains to
be seen if Beach’s in-
creased years, and fresh
water and a fair tide
under the lighter Cana-
dian, will make any dif-
ference. A Sunday
paper says a lump of
lead is to be chucked
into Beach's boat during
the race on Saturday,
An ounce of lead chucked
into the idiot who wrote
the par. would not be
put to a bad use.

Dan. O’Connor was
at the wrestling match
at Foley’s on Saturday
night, having for a com-
panion Jack Burke, the
British pugilist. By-the-

Gunn, the big cric-
keter, who was out with
Llllywhite last year, is
organising a team of foot-
ballers to “do ' the colo-

coaching Ihem in the
Melbourne game, with a
view to meeting the Cab-
bage Gardeners at their
own fancy. Gunn plays
with the Notts foot-
ballers.
At last there has been a genuine wrestling
contest in Sydney. Connor and Cannon's meat
for the money-prize and cup, presented by Larry
Foley, showed the best bit of wrestling yet se r n
in N.S.W., the lightning passes and cat-like
agility of such heavy men calling forth the wildest
applause frun the onlookers. Connor looked
absolutely fit, but it was not so with Cmnon,
who weighed fully a stone more than his com
panlon. The muscles of his shoulders and am s
did not look at all well developed, although it
must be confessed that Connor’s bruln-like hug
scarcely made an impression upon the body of his
burly opponent. Cannon got on a “ strangling
hold during the second bout, and Connor only
managed to get away in time, the compression
being so great that 16 caused his nose to bleed.
Cannon says the N S.W. people require educating
to the wrestling business, but somehow we don t
think his strangling holds will have the desired
effect. The men scored one and one, and Connor
won the decider in 11 min. 7seo.
