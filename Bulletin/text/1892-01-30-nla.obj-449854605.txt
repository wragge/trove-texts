ful information for every sufferer from the following com-
plaints, viz Loss of Energy and Will Power, NERVOUS

This Pamphlet is sent Free on Application,

If the patient’s ease is of long standing, and, therefore
in need of treatment, he should lose no time in writing
me a letter detailing in full his symptoms, on receipt of
which I will at once reply, explaining the nature of his
complaint, and if I can effect a cure, the time it will take,
and the cost of doing so. My long experience in the
treatment of Nervous Diseases has made me thoroughly
conversant with all their peculiarities. I am prepared,
therefore, to %
Smites a Permanent d Complete Cure is every case I undertake.
t invite the fullest investigation into my qualifications. For some time I was House Surgeon to the Great
Northern Hospital, London, where I had special opportunities of invertigating the causes of Nervous Diseases, and
become perfectly acquainted with the most approved scientific and successful methods of affecting their cure.

This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS. AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to hi *
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.

manently without unnecessary expence. This
book will prove a valuable companion, and even
though you be perfectly well its general inform-
tion and prescription may assist you in restoring
some poor friend to health even after his case has
been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tendant.
ONE POUND IS SUFFICIENT TO
SEND
for Remedies necessary for the cure of NER-
VOUS DEBILITY. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan*.
gerous„it would be advisable for you to sit down
quietly*in your chamber and write to the doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. He will
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
oponion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, send for his famous medical
work the price of which is but sixpence ; enclosed
in the volume will be found a list of carefully-pre-
pared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
Dr Richards uses nothing but the purest remedies,
and never prescribes mercury under any circum-
stances The moment letters are carefully per-
used and answered they are destroyed by fire,
and patients may rest assured that their cases
will remain a secret between the doctor and
themselves. Dr. Richards has successfully treated
nearly 25 000 cases since coming to Australia, and
has permission from at least 10,000 persons to
show their written evidence of his success. All

No medical man advertising in these colonies has medical
degrees which can be compared with his. Such eminent
qualifications, together with his recognised straightfor-
ward treatment, has naturally gained for him the reputa-
tion of being the
ONLY LEGALLY QUALIFIED DOCTOR
advertising in these colonies who combines with special
Knowledge Honest Treatment, as may easily be ascer-
tained by applying to any leading paper in the colony.
No diseases cause so much misery and distress as those
included in my speciality.
All Men Young and Old.
Suffering from the results of early follies or ex-
cesses, indigestion, foul mouth, costiveness, palpi-
tation, singing and pains in the ears and head,
specks before the eyes, giddiness, weakened
memory, pains in the back and chest, varicocele,
diseases of the bladder, kidneys, or liver, rheuma-
tism, impure blood, weakening discharges, impaired
vigor, sterility, premature decay, stricture, nervous-
ness, groundless fears, bashfulness, lassitude, and
NERVOUS DEBILITY, should lose no time in
consulting him, since he has, by long experience
and thorough investigation of their nature, dis-
covered the safest treatment for their permanent
cure. Persons residing at a distance may be treated
at their own homes, without any interruption to
their business, by giving a full and clear descrip-
tion of their symptoms, and the necessary medi-
cines will be forwarded to them. On receipt of
2s. 6d. he will forward his book on the “ Male
Generative Function in Health and Disease,”
or of Is., his book on “Nervous Debility.”

SATURDAY, JANUARY 30, 1892.
Government by Chaos.
The long-growing conviction that Party
Government is a failure has at last found
expression in an Australian Legislature.
In New South Wales, in recent times,
through the division of the House into three
sections instead of two as heretofore, Party
Government has been a worse failure than
usual, and the necessity for a change has
become more and more obvious. Therefore
an obscure member named G. D. Clark
drafted the following resolution, which was
duly relegated to an obscure corner of the
notice-paper, and looked upon by the old,
stereotyped politicians of the Assembly as
an unimportant fad which lay—in the old,
hackneyed phrase—beyond “the domain of
practical politics. ” And as practical politics
are generally held to consist only in un-
ivholesome scrambles after billets and office,
varied by efforts to secure some local conces-
sion for the township of Dry Forks or the
outlying settlement of Smith’s Curse, it may
be that these ancient men of routine and
dull monotony were perfectly right according
to their lights :
(1.) That the existing system of Party Government,
while enormously expensive to the country, manifestly
fails to secure the best possible results in the shape of
urgently required progressive legislation.
(2.) That it would facilitate the passing into law of
democratic measures if administrative and executive
functions were performed by a Committee elected by
Parliament.
(3.) That all questions of great national importance
should, before their final adoption, be submitted to a
vote of the entire adult population of the country.
* # *
Regarded as the first legislative sign of the
beginning of a new era in the art of govern-
ment this motion is a matter of some im-
portance. Apart from that, however, it has
no importance worth mentioning. Mr. 6.
D. Clark will probably be dead or will have
vanished out of politics before the reform is
fairly begun, and the same old motion will
come up for discussion 20, or perhaps 50,
times ere it produces any results. If Mr.
Clark succeeds in retaining his precarious
seat for 15 or 20 years, and, abandoning
cold-water hysterics, devotes himself solely
to this one subject—if ke becomes one of the
fearsome bores of the House, and raises his
topic on every possible occasion, and is
counted out almost every time he raises it—
if he hangs on to it till other members fly
from him in the refreshment-room, and
dodge him in the lobby, lest he should
button-hole them on the dreary question of
constitutional reform—and if he still sticks
to it till he becomes a veteran crank and an
object of derision to [the daily press—then
he may at last, in the course of years, see it
arrive within the domain of “ practical
politics,” and have the pleasure of knowing
that it has advanced a stage on the road to
success. After that some more prominent
politician will steal the idea and shunt Mr.
G. D. Clark, and refuse to recognise him
when they meet. The new politician will
stump the country on it, and will form a
party on the strength of it in the House,
and the daily press will gravely speculate as
to whether “ the time is yet ripe ” for such
a change, and then at last a Bill embodying
Mr. Clark’s idea will be passed, and the
Upper House—if there is one in these
days—will carefully throw it out. There-
upon there will be several more “ electoral
campaigns ” till the Upper House is coerced
into passing the measure, after which the
Governor—if there is still a Governor—will
probably “withhold his consent.” And, last
of all, the reform will get through in triumph,
and if Mr. Clark tries to assert in that far-
distant future that he is the father—in a
Parliamentary sense—of the great measure,
he will be thrown out as a base impostor,
while the country raises a monument to the
man who borrowed the idea just when it
promised to become successful. We men-
tion these things merely to encourage Mr.
G. D. Clark in his new path as a constitu-
tional reformer. The country is growing
tired of Party Government, but even when
the nation is absolutely howling for a great
reform, its progress is very slow ; when the
nation is not howling for it, its progress is
still slower.
* * *
The present system of Government is
a combination of so many impossibilities,
contradictions, and hopeless anachronisms
that its endurance for so many years is one
of the great political phenomena of the
age. In the first place, it pre-supposes
that every legislative body will be naturally
and permanently divided into two parties—
a supposition which is, in itself, a manifest
absurdity—yet the scheme can work success-
fully on no other basis. The people of New
South Wales are divided into something
like 150 separate religious sects, and
political sects are, if anything, still more
numerous. There are, in the present
Assembly, Freetrade Federationists and
Freetrade anti-Federationists, Protectionist
Federationists and Protectionist anti-Feder-
ationists, Freetrade Federationists who sup-
port Local Option, Freetrade Federationists
who do not support Local Option, Freetrade
anti-Federationists who are split in the same
fashion, Protectionist Federationists and
Protectionist anti-Federationists both simi-
larly sub-divided, Land Nationalisers who are
divided into Freetraders and Protectionists,
and sub-divided on Federation, Local Option,
and other questions, Socialists of all varieties,
and Labour members who are divided on the
fiscal issue, and sub-divided on the question
of Australian unity, and sub-sub-divided on
all the other questions already mentioned.
Also, there are Republicans who are split up
on the tariff question, and split some more
on the Labour question, and re-split on the
Federation question, and split over again on
the drink question, and all these varieties of
split-up Republicans are split still more on
every other question on record ; and there
are Imperialists who are divided into as
many varieties as the rest ; and, in addition
to all these, there are sectarian difficulties
arising out of the 150 different religions of
the province, and personal difficulties which
are about as many as all the previous
difficulties put together, and other difficulties
too numerous to mention. The final result
is that there are not, and never were, and
never will be even two men in the Assembly
who think sufficiently alike to form an
honest and conscientious party with a
workable programme. Yet out of all these
heterogeneous elements it is necessary to find
nine men who either think alike, or who will
falsely say that they do for the sake of the
salary, in order to form a Government; and
behind them it is necessary to find at least
62 more who will tell the same glaring
untruth for various other motives. And in
an equally heterogeneous Upper House it is
essential to raise a similar majority under
exactly the same difficulties, while in each
House the section that doesn’t profess to
believe everything which the Ministry says
that it believes is bound by the unwritten
laws of the constitution to profess to believe
everything which the leader of the Opposi-
tion says that he believes. And if the
House doesn’t divide itself into exactly two
sections, the result is chaos.
One of the most noteworthy features of
the system is that the people have practically
no voice in the election of the Ministry.
When a politician attains a certain distinc-
tion—no matter how—he becomes, in fact,
a practically irremoveable incubus. When
the alleged Freetrade party was uppermost
in New South Wales the Governor of the
period was wont to “send for” Parkes, and
however much the party and the portion of
the nation which it represented might object
to Parkes, it had to endure him or else let
the power pass into the hands of its
opponents. And when it had accepted
Parkes, as an unavoidable evil, for the
sake of Freetrade, it had to accept any
other individuals whom he chose to
appoint for the sake of Parkes. There
might not be in the whole Ministry one
single individual whom the party would have
chosen under a system of direct taxation,
but if it voted against them it thereby voted
against its principles, and therefore it en-
dured them as the only way in which it
could express its continued adhesion to a
Freetrade policy. And, having endured
them, it had also to endure all their works
however objectionable. It might loathe
every separate individual in the Cabinet ;
it might loathe their land policy, and their
public works policy, and their education
policy, and everything except their fiscal
policy, but so long as the party was a Free-
trade party it had to support the Freetrade
Government in all its iniquities, or else
overturn the Freetrade system. Therefore,
almost every Government goes in for land-
swindles and nepotism, and builds railways
through its own property, and sells its worth-
less allotments to the §tate for “reserves,”
and fakes contracts for its friends, because
it knows that the House cannot express its
disapproval of one of these things without
oversetting the entire Cabinet, and it hesi-
tates to do this because it can only get
another equally irresponsible Cabinet in
exchange.
# * *
The system of Party Government has no
single advantage to counterbalance all these
disabilities. The governing force of the
country, under the present policy, is solely
and entirely the dominant faction in the
Legislative Assembly. The country hires
this faction to do the work of legislation,
and hires the other faction to prevent it
doing it. It also hires the Legislative
Council to prevent it doing it, and it pays
the Governor for the same purpose, for the
only active exertion which is permitted him
is that of occasionally withholding his assent
to Acts of Parliament, and all his other
functions could be performed equally well
by a stuffed monkey. And, in addition
to all these, it keeps the Queen in the back-
ground as another agency to prevent it doing
it, for that gracious potentate’s authority
over Australia also consists solely in with-
holding her assent; and amid all these
obstacles there is much heavy toil in the
art and mystery of legislation, and the
national Sisyphus spends most of its time
in rolling ponderous bills uphill, and seeing
them roll down agfqn every time they ap-
proach the summit.
# # *
The scheme advanced years ago by The
Bulletin, and now submitted to the New
South Wales Parliament by Mr. Clark,
offers a remedy for at least a great part of
these numerous anomalies. It provides that
all Ministers shall be elected directly by a
vote of the Assembly, so that it will be
practicable to collect all the ablest represen-
tatives and combine them in one Cabinet,
quite irrespective of their political opinions.
Each man will administer his own depart-
ment, will draft what Bills he thinks fit, and
introduce them on his own responsibility,
and will be at liberty to criticise his col-
leagues or anybody else with absolute
freedom. The House will be at liberty to
reject or amend any or every proposition
brought forward by a Minister without
thereby expressing a “want of confidence” in
him ; it merely appoints him for a certain
period to do certain administrative work at
a fixed salary, but it does not pledge itself
by any means to endorse all his actions and
those of his colleagues under a penalty of
losing his services. Under this system it
could appoint Mr. M‘Millan to be Trea-
surer, if it had faith in his arithmetic, and
yet enforce a Protectionist policy, and the
fact of the House adopting such a policy and
directing the Treasurer to carry it out would
in no sense reflect upon his sincerity as a
Freetrader. His position would be just the
same as that of the Freetrade policeman
who continues to run in drunks with his old
vigour under a Protectionist regime, or the
Freetrade Governor who continued to
be a Governor under the same condi-
tions ; his private sentiments would be
his own affair, in which the Legis-
lature took no manner, of interest. The
system is one under which the nation would
make its own laws and appoint the Govern-
ment to carry them out, instead of the
Government appointing itself and then
making laws on its own account ; and it
would practically abolish the device of party,
because no Minister could do anything for
his party nor could any mere party do much
for him, and the old bond of self-interest
would therefore soon dissolve. Also, it would
wipe out no-confidence motions, for the
House would not be expected to have con-
fidence in the Cabinet at any time ; it would
extinguish the practice of the Ministry
“going to the country”; it would abolish
Government policies, for the nation itself
would supply the policy ; and it would give
every question a fair chance to be decided
on its own merits irrespective of party
interests. For all of which reasons it is one
of the most desirable reforms of the age, and
if only by reason of its desirability it will
probably come long after Mr. G. D. Clark
lias died of extreme old age and natural
decay.
Theatrical Management and the Press.
A question of considerable interest to the
Press at large and theatrical management in
general is involved in the present state of
affairs between the Melbourne Age and the
local Theatre Royal. Three weeks ago The
Bulletin published a paragraph accounting for
the careful omission from Age news columns of
any reference to the Melbourne Royal panto-
mime, subsequent to the appearance of a cold,
fault-finding, first-night notice. Mr. George
Coppin had cut down the list of newspaper
deadheads to the minimum liumbtslf of one from
each office, and the Age, being a high-minded,
liberal, honest, enterprising, unprejudiced
representative of “respectable” journalism—
in fact what is called a “ great” newspaper by
others of the same length, breadth and he ■
ness—had, in the expressive language of o 1
unorthodox, taken the huff. We had aln
written “got its knife into Coppin ”
as a matter of fact, the wrath,
or indignation (let us say) of the Age’s tv*’
prietor (which was presently aggravated bv°
large reduction in the Royal advertisement!
didn’t assume an aggressive form. His vo'.
of popular opinion merely remained dumb' 06
the subject of “ Dick Whittington,” whil s t°>
sang, often and loudly, the praises of rival
shows. It was especially unprejudiced i
puffing another pantomime (since deceased) at
the Alexandra, which, as attendances dwindled
down to the non-paying point, was found bv
the Age to “ show no indication of falling o ff j
popular favour,” and to “seem to improve h
dash and sparkle every week of its existence 11
when the imminent ending of said existence
was actually announced. Whether the Act
killed the one panto, with kindness whilst
strengthening the other with its neglect is a
possibility worth consideration. David Syme’s
contempt often acts as a tonic, and the breath
of his approval is apt to wither things right m
But this by the way.
» * *
The Age, which lately pleaded guilty to'tak-
ing a “ cursory glance ” at The Bulletin, re-
peated that indiscretion and so became aware
that the story of its quarrel with George
Ooppin was already going the round of Austra-
lia. The Age’s policy of silence was burst up, its
petty little hand exposed. With one eye (the
cursory eye) still glaring at The Bulletin and
the other gazing longingly on his ledger, David
Syme at last decided to sacrifice a few pounds
per week by refusing to accept any more advts,
from the Theatre Royal. Rash, petulant, short-
sighted person ! So long as he had taken the
advt. and said nothing about the show in
his gratuitous records of public amusements
David was simply suppressing a truth, a
very common occurrence in ‘ ‘ respectable ”
journalism. Pushing Dick, Tom, or Harry to
the fore, and keeping George covered up, as
you may say. But when he declined to take
the money, repudiating the glittering greed of
the Theatre Royal for two inches of advt. space
David was doing all that in him lay to deprive
a legitimate enterprise of its legitimate means
of support. Theatres, under present conditions
really buy the means of existence from news-
papers, and no expensive entertainment could
live without advertising. Mr. Syme has a sub-
lime belief in this doctrine, and members of his
staff, likely enough, echo the great master’s
sentiments when they amble around the press-
circle declaring that the Royal treasury is
losing £3OO a-week as the result of the Age’s
latest move. However, no such amount of
damage seems to have been inflicted upon the
theatre, although the colossal income of Syme
is evidently a decimal less than it might be.
# # #
In the long run, the Age, sticking to its
vengeance, would find much cause for regret,
inasmuch as the worthlessness of its theatrical
intelligence would pass into a proverb. But,
in the meantime, Mr. George Coffin has
to consider that, as competition goes on and
new things are produced, he couldn’t afford
to calmly ignore the fact that an influential
journal is studiously ignoring his theatre. An
established pantomime at the Xmas season is
almost independent of the Press, but a novelty
requires all the preliminary push it can get.
In plain English, if the Age persists in refusing
to advertise the Theatre Royal in the usual
way, the theatre must advertise itself at the
Age’s expense. Coffin has it in his power to
speak from the stage every evening—he once, it
may be remembered, spoke from the stage with
crushing effect about another Melbourne paper—
and printon the programmes a simple statement,
which would be worth a yard of space in Syme’s
paper. Such speeches from the stage are, in
the usual way, angry protests against fair treat-
ment, and go for nothing. Here would be an
exactly opposite case. Considering that at least
one other Melbourne manager has complained in
the past of unfair treatment from the Age, and
has discovered that its tactics of offence can’t be
quietly endured for ever, the wonder is that a
league of managers hasn’t sprung from the
present opportunity. Why don’t they all
quarrel with the Age, and save several hun-
dreds per annum apiece ? Do they suppose that
the flood of theatre-goers would be affected by
a cessation in the flow of Age notices, or by a
system of all-round “slating” in that one
particular journal ? Bah ! If three or
four theatres chose to pull together, not
necessarily as regards the length of their
advts., but in the choice of their adver-
tising-media, they would all stand the same
relative chances of success as at present, and all
effect the same percentage of saving on their
present expenses. Think over it. Four or
five theatres constitute a monopoly in either
Melbourne or Sydney, and can limit their own
advt. market just as easily as they can try to
cut one another’s throats. Is there no esprit da
corps among theatrical managers ?
PLAIN ENGLISH.
“Wanted—A Crown Defender.”
Dear Bulletin, —In last week’s issue you
published an article with the above heading iu
which you demonstrate the necessity for u
Crown Defender as the natural complement or
the Crown Prosecutor. 8o far the theory is a
good one, for when the Crown supplies an
officer to work up the case against a friendless
and penniless prisoner, it is absolutely fair tha
it should also supply a similar officer to work
up the case iu his favour—otherwise the jury
never gets a chance to hear the defence, an
the accused has no earthly show, whether
guilty or innocent. But the plan has one
great defect; it is incomplete. When the law
arrests a friendless and impecunious suspect--'
and the individuals on whom the law drops are
generally impecunious—it carefully puts him m
gaol, and then it sends out a corps if train 6
detectives to hunt up alhthe facts they can n®
to secure his conviction. They may distort tn
facts, or they may even invent them, or they


v find out Just enough of the truth to make
"blasting case against the prisoner and stop
fhere whereas a more complete investigation
nuld have put the matter in an entirely new
ivlit These officers supply the materials for
he Crown Prosecutor—and though a lawyer
1 aV at times, pull through without any materials
they are generally essential. Meanwhile the
1 risoncr, being placed carefully under lock, and
hev has no opportunity to hunt up facts and
witnesses on his own side. Even if he has
money the detectives are not at his service—
their business is to prove him guilty ; and if he
1 , (S 110 money neither the detectives nor any
other legal agencies whatever are at his service.
Therefore, in an intricate case the Crown
Prosecutor will be armed with all the evidence
which the force can rake together, while the
prown Defender, having no outside assistance,
will be left to paw the air and depend on
rhetoric and fireworks and perorations. In
many instances, such as that of Edward Bell,
in Melbourne, the police begin by getting on a
wrong track, and having found a prisoner, they
build up a case to fit him, and obstinately
refuse to consider even the possibility of his
innocence or of anybody else’s guilt. Under
SU ch conditions an innocent man can only save
himself by finding the guilty one through his
own efforts and at his own expense. If Bell
had been defended by a Crown official he would,
in all probability, have arrived in gaol just the
same, unless that official had been aided by
a detective department of his own, whose
duty it was to collate his case and
to hunt up all testimony favourable to the
prisoner. The evidence was readily avail-
able ; nearly every detective in the local force
was convinced of Bell’s innocence and of the
real offender’s guilt —save only the one officer
who worked up the charge. But the business of
the department was to secure convictions, not
to demonstrate anybody’s innocence ; there was
nobody to gather up the facts for the accused ;
and even had a Crown Defender been in
existence, there would have been no channel
through which these facts would ever have
reached him—unless, indeed, that dignified
barrister went forth in disguise and did his
own police duty, which is a highly improbable
circumstance. The Crown Defender, in fact,
under present circumstances, would be a species
of naked and unarmed legal ornament, without
even a brief to travel upon. It is absolutely
essential that such a functionary should be ap-
pointed, but along with him there must be
created a separate detective department to
prepare the case for the defence. A Defender
without any defence is hardly worth having. —
Yours, etc., Titus Salt.
Wanted—An Enquiry.
Judge Boucaut, of South Australia, the other
day, finished an inquiry into what is mildly
described as the “conduct” of James
Anderson, captain of the British ship Mill-
wall. Anderson’s “conduct,”’ as alleged
by the witnesses, consisted in. the fact
that he had banged and kicked his
second mate almost to death, while that
unfortunate officer was too ill to retaliate;
that he had removed him, when he was dying,
to a bunk in a deck-house, where—the weather
being rough—he was perpetually drenched
with water ; and that he had refused him even
the scanty medical comforts within reach—in
short, that the mate had been killed by brutal
violence, wanton exposure, and neglect. The
matter was carried, in the first place, before
the Marine Board, but that body decided that
it could not interfere unless in a case where the
captain had neglected his duty as a seaman,
and thereby endangered his vessel—in other
words, the Marine Board considered that its
business was to look after property, and that
human life was not its affair. Then a species
of informal inquiry was held before Judge
Boucaut. Two witnesses the carpenter
and a seaman swore that the mate’s
death was caused, or ■ at least acceler-
ated, by a process of slow brutality,
and no dispassionate evidence was called to dis-
prove their statement, yet on the strength of
the captain’s bald assertion Judge Boucaut
went out of his way to assert that lie utterly
disbelieved their testimony. He didn’t order
the rest of the crew to be called as witnesses,
but simply let the matter drop there and then,
and he rashly gave some of his reasons for
doing so, which were about the most surprising
reasons ever heard in a court of justice. For
instance :
The captain may, or may not, have struck the second
mate, and if he did it was a wrong thing for the captain
to do, but he did not call upon the captain to answer
that. . . Supposing the kicking did take place it was
without doubt a wrong thing to do, but the mate could
have had the matter investigated before a magistrate at
one of the ports, and be could have been fined for it.
In other words, the Judge apparently didn’t
believe the mate had been ill-treated because
he didn’t lay a complaint and “have the matter
investigated.” And the trifling fact that the
mate was dead before reaching port, and past
laying complaints, didn’t seem to count at all.
Again, when a witness swore that the captain
was “rolling about and smelt of liquor,” the
Judge, as reported, almost got into a rage at
this aspersion on that officer’s character ;—-
-AVhat! Do you mean to say that, with a gale of wind
plowing, you could smell the captain’s breath. The thing
is absorb, that’s the sort of thing they tell in America,
tou almost make me angry.
Buch a Judge as that is too innocent for this
world. Anyone who stands to leeward of an
individual who has got drunk on ship’s rum
can smell him in a hurricane. Vet Boucaut dis
bussed the case, apparently for the two reasons
-hat the mate didn’t lay an information, after
16 was dead, and that a drunken man can’t be
smelt in a gale, therefore a witness who pro-
fessed to smell him must be utterly unreliable.
At the same time lie refused to allow costs,
and ] ie didn’t order the arrest of the two
witnesses, which was an absolutely unaccount-
a . omission, for either the captain had com-
mitted murder or his accusers had committed
perjury, and Judge Boucaut was thus tacitly
" inking at one out of two utterly horrible
crimes. Evidently, in Boucaut’s estimation,
muucide at sea, unlike homicide on land, is a
Hnu dl affair, and hardly worth noticing.
I hen any one is accused of flic latter crime,
he authorities raise hea’eu and earth to find
every witness who can cast any light upon the
matter ; in the case of Anderson, two witnesses
swore that an offence had been committed and
the accused said it hadn’t, and no one even
thought it worth while to fetch the rest of the
crew into court to give their version of the
affair.

Plural Voting in N.S. Wales: Its Origin.
The New South Wales plural vote emanated
from the brains of the subtle politicians whose
prestige was endangered by the introduction of
manhood suffrage. It is an excrescence on the
original Constitution. Its history forms a large
chapter in the career of the very Premier
Parkes who was directed last June by the
vox populi to re-enact single voting. For it is
beyond dispute that Parkes, both by vote and
voice, assisted to barter away the liberties of
the people. He assisted to give real estate a
co-equal voice with manhood in the Councils of
the province. The Constitution, for the first
few years of its existence, provided for single
voting ; but this principle was quietly dropped
when manhood suffrage was made an electoral
qualification in 1858. The original qualification
of an elector was the possession of a freehold of
the value of £lOO, or leasehold of the annual
value of £lO, or the occupancy of a building
of the annual value of £lO, or the holding
of a pastoral license, or the receipt of an
annual salary of £lOO, or the rental of a
room in a lodging-house. No man could
be registered unless he were a resident of
six months’ standing in a district ; and
no voter could poll until all rates and taxes, if
any, had been paid. Plural voting, therefore,
was not allowable under the Constitution of
New South Wales in the first instance any
more than it is allowable under the Constitu-
tion of South Australia at the present time.
Single voting in New South Wales received its
death-blow from the hand of “Slippery
Charlie ” Cowper, with the approbation of
Robertson, Deniehy, Dalley, Parkes, Pid-
dington, Flood, Forster, Thornton, and
Byrnes. Parkes and Thornton alone survive
in the Legislature. The original Constitution
was shorn of the electoral sections ; and in a
new Electoral Act the parliamentary franchise
was given to every adult male resident of six
months’ standing, and, without regard to such
residence, to, amongst others, every subject
having a freehold of the clear unencumbered value
of £lOO or a leasehold of clear unencumbered
value of £lO per year or a pastoral lease or
license from the Crown. The balance of voting
power was vested in the owners and lessees
of real estate, in club-men, and in occu-
pants of offices. An elector qualified by man-
hood could vote only in his own electorate;
but an elector of the non-resident class could
vote in every electorate in which he held a
qualification ; and if he happened to be doubly
qualified for a district, he was restricted to one
vote for that district. The new qualifications
were debated at much length ; but the principle
of plural voting emerged safely from the ordeal.
The final division on the clause throws a side-
light on the conduct of Parkes. Will it be
believed that Parkes helped to “ tell” the ayes
in that memorable division ? Plural voting
plus manhood suffrage was substituted for
single voting by the votes of Parkes, Cowper,
Robertson, Martin, Thornton and Byrnes.
And, by a strange irony of fate, Parkes was
the first Premier to rise in the Assembly and
move the abolition of plural voting ! His
sincerity was suspected, and the doubt was
amply justified by his subsequent conduct. Has
Parkes ever been an honest advocate of man-
hood suffrage ?

Boiling a Family.
Last week, in South Melbourne, a gentleman
named Cobb arrived home in a rage, thrashed
his wife, broke the furniture, kicked one of his
sons, and made a great effort to choke another
one. Then he knocked down his wife and the
two youths, and deliberately poured boiling
water over them. Mrs. Cobb is horribly dis-
figured for life as the result of this episode, and
the two sons are both frightfully injured. On
Saturday the law crashed heavily down on Mr.
Cobb on account of these proceedings, and told
him thathe was a fiend and a monster of iniquity.
Then it sent him to gaol for a whole six months,
and the papers mention, as an evidence that
the criminal code is an awful thing when
roused, that this was done “ without the option
of a fine.” If Cobb, instead of boiling three
people, had stolen £2O or so, he would probably
have got three years, and to a dead certainty
he would have got 12 months ; and it would
have been entirely superfluous to mention that
he wasn’t allowed the option of a fine. The
code regards boiling three people as a mere
trifling unpleasantness compared with a
deficiency in the cash ; it heaves awful
language at Cobb and tells him that
he is a loathsome wretch and utterly unfit
to live, and announces that it will fall on him
in a way that will strike terror into all such
individuals for the future, and then it gives
him just half a year : and, at the same time, it
tells the small embezzler that it will let him
down lightly on account of his youth and pre-
vious good character, and gives him, probably,
eighteen months. In other words, the law and
its officers are so utterly callous, that they
regard six months’ detention in a commodious
and airy gaol as a fearful vengeance upon the man
who only boiled his family, and consider three
times that punishment as a light and mitigated
penalty on the person who bolts with a small
cheque. And even in its brutal disregard for
life and its grovelling worship of property the
South Melbourne bench is utterly illogical.
Mrs. Cobb, in her natural or unboiled state,
had a certain market value as a worker or
animal of burden ; she will probably be incapa-
citated or her value greatly diminished for at
least three months, and allowing only 15s.
a-week as the worth of her services, the loss in
hard cash is £9 15s. Estimating the falling-off
in the value of her two sons at 10s. a-week
eacli for the same period, there is a further loss
of £l3, "or a total of £22 15s. It is a very low
calculation indeed to put down medical
expenses for a whole scalded family at £l5,
making a grand total—irrespective of smashed
furniture and damage to clothes—of £37 15s.
If Alexander Cobb, being a man with no
influential friends, had embezzled that amount
in the ordinary way, without boiling water or
other violence, he would have got at least a
year in gaol —many a man, for no greater an
injury to the sacred interests of property, has
got ten years, but we put the sentence down at
the lowest estimate. Therefore, Mr. Cobb gets
a reduction of at least six months—or, it may
be, as much as nine years and six months—
because he boiled his family in addition to his
offence against property ; in fact, in the eye of
the law it is plainly a commendable thing to
boil a family.
A week or so ago the magistrates at Melbourne
City Court tried one David Byrne for stealing
a shilling, and sent him to gaol for three months.
This is at the rate of exactly fourpence a month,
and on the same principle two big embezzlers
recently sentenced would have been sent up for
570,000 years and 226,000 years respectively,
while Fourdrinier, who was, comparatively
speaking, only a small shortage man, would
have been locked up for a little over seventy
centuries. It would be interesting to know on
what principle—if there really is a principle and
the Law doesn’t toss up —sentences are inflicted.
Either the penalty is supposed to be dealt out
according to the amount of damage done by
the defendant to the plaintiff, or else it is
measured by the moral aspect of the case
as a breakage of the Ten Commandments,
or else, again, the Court may make an effort to
combine the two considerations, which is much
the same as trying to add a mile-and-a-half to
£1 3s. 9d. In the first case there is a manifest
absurdity in sending David Byrne to gaol for
three months for the theft of a shilling while
Fourdrinier gets only 12 months for a dis-
crepancy of over £l4OO, and if the law considers
only the damage done, either Byrne’s sentence
is utterly brutal and atrocious, or else the
Courts have shown gross partiality to Four-
drinier, either from ignorance or some other
cause not specified. Again, if the brief, tran-
sitory Panton of the period tries to fix his
sentences on the moral aspect of the offence, then
there is probably little difference between the
breakage of one commandment and thebreakage of
another—there is a smashed commandment, in
either case—and everybody ought to get the
same penalty. Apparently, however, he endea-
vours, in some unaccountable fashion, to combine
the two elements, and to maintain, at the same
time, a due regard for the accused person’s
respectability or the reverse ; he multiplies the
cash stolen by the broken commandment, and
divides the result by the prisoner’s clothes and
bell-topper, and the final product is the sen-
tence. And as the average “ beak ” is a
hideously bad arithmetician, and has nobody to
audit his accounts, the results arrived at are
eminently surprising.
“Cardinal Moran to succeed Cardinal
Manning.” Why not at once : “ Cardinal Moran

Owing to Belle Bilton being the mother of

leg.
When Rudyard Kipling was asked what
was his first impression on landing in Sydney, he
replied, “ The loose flagstones which when trod on
squirt dirty water over the unfortunate
pedestrian.”
“ Colonial English,” a collection of Aus-
tralian and Anglo-Indian Argot by Karl Lentz-
ner, Ph. Dr., who describes himself on his title-
page, “formerly examiner in modern languages
at the Sydney Grammar School and at the King’s
School, Parramatta,” was published at the end of
last year at London, and almost instantly with-
drawn. The latter step was the proper one to
take, and the former was very improper, as the
material, badly compiled at the best, violated
several copyrights. The illustrations given of
Australian slang are very funny for the most
part, and where they are exact and authentic the
source, in nine instances out of ten, is inaccurately
stated. The very faults of the work, however,
will give it a value in collectors’ eyes, and those
who were fortunate enough to get hold of one of
the few copies which reached Australia may now
be interested in learning that the book is already
selling at fancy prices.
In the by-gone days—somewhere about
the seventies—“ The Vagabond ” once undertook,
in a rash moment, to deliver a lecture on the
Chinese question in Brisbane. Julian was not a
good speaker then—he is nob a first-rate one now,
but 20 years ago he was almost as bad as Stanley
—and the audience did not take him kindly. Still
he struggled along till a big German became abso-
lutely insupportable, and then the“Vag.” appealed
to him in pathetic terms: “Now, my Teutonic
friend,” he said, “do be calm.” The Rhinelander
didn’t become calm; in fact he grew more
vociferous, and presently Julian tried again. “I
would appeal to my Teutonic friend,” he said
kindly, “not to interrupt.” More howls, while
“the Vag.” struggled to bear up against the
storm. “If my Teutonic friend,” he began again,
in despair, and’ then the German leaped on a form
and cursed in real earnest. “ Tonigs,” he
shrieked ; “ Tonigs, I vos not von vot brinks your
soft tacks. I vash not brink tonigs. Yen I brinks
I trinks goot prandy.” Julian gathered up his
sermon then and left, and the German took
possession of the hall and lectured all by himself
on drinks in general.
Mr. Frank Rogers, Q.C., now President
of N.S.W. Land Court, with a salary of £l5OO,
is to be raised to the rank of a Supreme Court
Judge, with a salary of £2600, and is to fill in
his spare time in hearing non-Land-Court cases.
Mr. Rogers is not only a good advocate, but a
most able lawyer. However, he doesn’t look like a
lawyer, but like a low-comedian, his countenance
being decorated with a lugubrious smile, appar-
ently copied from a’mask of Comedy which we
once saw on an actor’s tombstone in a Parisian
cemetery. During the trial of “ Captain
Moonlight,” and while that fine ruffian was
addressing the jury, Mr. Rogers, who was sitting
at the court table, turned his head for a moment
to speak to a man beside him, whereupon “ Moon-
light” turned fiercely upon the Q.C. and accused
him of jeering at his misfortunes—at the misfor-
tunes of a man fighting against odds for his life
(“Moonlight” was hanged as a consequence of
the trial). Now, Mr. Rogers, who is a most sym-
pathetic man, was doing nothing of the. kind, and
arose and apologetically told the prisoner so. It
was poor Rogers’ smile that had got him into all
the trouble.
In a Front Pew.
I wonder if anyone will dare to remark upon my
coming so early. If they do, I shall not care. I
have gained my point. I have a good seat here,
right at the back of the pews reserved for the
family; and I can see everything. I’m close
enough to the chancel to note every wave of feel-
ing that crosses his face ! and he has such a tell-
tale face. I’ve watched it many a time at closer
range than this. I wonder whether —but no ! I
didn’t come here to wonder. I’m not going to
grow sentimental. I made up my mind to be an
iceberg; to be coldly critical; to smile a cynical
smile, even while my heart bleeds. O, I hope no
one will say ill-natured things because I came
early. I really do care a great deal. If they
were to say that the girl he jilted was at the
church door before it was open because she still
loves him, I should simply go mad. I wish
I had not come so early, or laid myself open
to such remarks. If I had stopped away perhaps
it would have better indicated my indifference.
But, no. Then they would have said I was at
home, crying my eyes out because of my lost love.
After all, who knows that I was the first one in
the church? No one, except the groomsmen, and
men are not gossips. If they were women I should
have reason to feel uneasy.
It is as I supposed. They have used chrysan-
themums, and chrysanthemums only, in the
decoration. White and yellow. More yellow
than white, too. Ah ! yes. Yellow’s for jealousy.
But, then, there are more leaves than flowers.
More green than yellow. How very appropriate !
Green signifies fickleness ; and there’s not a sprig
of blue in all the sanctuary. Blue’s for constancy.
And I What made me do it ? How awfully
thoughtless of me ! —I have on a blue gown. Will
they comment on that, I wonder ?
I was not so very much ahead of time. There
are fully a score of people scattered about the
pews now, and the groomsmen are growing busier
every minute. Ido not propose to move up for
anyone. I must have this corner seat. I came to
see, and I’m going to see. Here come those
dreadful relations of hers, the Parvenus. I never
could understand how he could get over that
stumbling-block. Fancy marrying into the family
of a man who cut off lamb-chops in the market for
your mother when she first began housekeeping !
Papa says that if men got their deserts in this
world, Parvenu would be in prison.
And there are her cousins, the O’Gradys ! Who
was it told me that Jim O’Grady was the champion
professional middle-weight prize-fighter of Bir-
mingham five years ago, before his father made
two millions and a-half in mining stocks and then
died and left it to his three sons and two
daughters ?
Gracious goodness ! What a scowl Dick
Flatterby has on ! How is it men can’t hide their
feelings ? Everybody knows he was hot foot after
the bride of to-day, before to-day’s bridegroom
stepped in and carried her heart by storm. I
hope I’m not scowling like that. Why, the man
actually carries his heart on his sleeve. If I were
in his place, I think I should have been too busy
to come. A man has so many excuses for stopping
away; whereas a woman —heavens ! How ill-
natured I am !
There’s the organ, at last. I wondered whether
we were ever going to have any music. She doesn’t
know a note, and I’d begun to think that possibly
out of deference to her ignorance they had decided
to disnense with the usual preliminary recital.
Can it be that he is playing Schumann’s
“Reverie?” O, how cruel ! How cruel! Why,
I have played that for him myself, a hundred
times. I played it the last—Come ! Come ! This
will never do. Why, everything is getting hazy.
My eyes are wet, I know ; and—O, if anyone
should see me use a handkerchief, what would
they say ?
There! I hope no one noticed it. Here come
his mother and sister. Let me see ! Three minutes
of the time. In a quarter of an hour they will be
her mother and her sister, and it is less than three
months since I was sure that one day they would
be mine. Oh ! how I should have loved that dear,
stately old lady, with her white hair ! and how
fond I should have been of that girl, so
How I hate them both ! How I hate him, and
everything that belongs to him ! I shall be able
to show them some day, I hope. Oh, yes ! That
is why I am here; because I hate him, and not
because, as some people may think, there is a
spark of the old love still left.
It is already one minute past the time. Every-
body is looking around. Everybody in the church,
I think, except myself. I will not look. Now the
organ has stopped. Ah ! the bridal party has
arrived. Now they have rushed at double-quick
time to the doorway ; and —yes, yes. It is he. I
saw his face there, just for a second, peeping out
from the vestry. I wonder if he is nervous.
Suppose he should refuse to marry her at the last
minute?
Heaven ! how that organist is bungling the
wedding-march ! I don’t believe he could ever
have played it before. They are coming up the
aisle now, I know, though I will not look around.
It is solemn, anybody must say it is. That slow,
measured step: it is like a walk to the execu-
tioner’s block. Here he comes. Her brother is
his best man, and how small, how insignificantly
small he looks beside the bridegroom, beside you.
I have ray eyes upon your face now. Do you
feel them? Do you? You do, I am sure; and
yet you dare not look. You are very graceful,
and yet I have seen you offer your arm with more
grace than you do to your bride. You have
offered it to me—and your smile, oh it is a
ghastly smile, sir. ... I didn’t think your
voice 'would tremble so, I thought you were
stronger than that. How glad lam ! You feel
my eyes upon you still, don’t you ? Do you feel
the hate that is in them? It is the hate that is
choking you. How proud she must be of you,
stuttering and stammering there beside her. I
almost feel sorry for her. . . .
It is over—over at last—and you are hers. Her
husband—not mine. She is your wife. Will you
look at me, I wonder ? You must pass so close to
me. Will you look? Will you? Will you? You
must! I will make you ! You shall see the hate
that is in my heart. You shall! You shall !
My God ! I made him! He looked at me
fully and squarely. His eyes—his dear eyes—and
they told me so much ! While in mine—no ; there
was not hate—there was love, love , love !—Haw k.
Dear Bulletin,—! lately r.eacl a story in
a Sydney paper about Australian wines being sold
in London as French. This is a fiction, for, to
begin with, people don’t often pawn off a superior
article as an inferior one, and at present, at least,
Australian wines cannot compare with the French
—that is real French wines, not the manufacture
of Cette and Hamburg. One often ]tears these
stories of French connoisseurs being taken in, but
they are pure inventions. As a matter of fact all
the wine you can produce for export can be sold
here for what it is. One firm alone sells more
Australian wine in England than is exported from
the Australias, and Italy has to be largely drawn
upon to make up the deficit. —L., Loudon, Ist

«16 Macquarie-street North, Sydney, January 27, 1892
My Dear Moorabinda,—
Improvements to the members’ stand atßandwiok were
foreshadowed by Mr. Dangar at the recent A.J.C. inert,
ing, but what shape they are to take will remain a deep
architectural mystery until society is serenely sitting on
the inevitable wet paint. But I fervently hope that
when they have gilded and glorified the southern end of
Ihe grand-stand to transfoimation-scene pitch they will
erect automatic barriers which will keep everybody out
but people who have a right there, and so do away with
those unedifying man-chases which happen before nearly
every race. And, talking of Randwick improvements, a
carriage-shelter is shrieked for by people whose vehicles
crack and blister in the fervid sun every fine race-day,
hut the committee listen coyly to the prayer.
Talking indirectly about horses, what does the published
name-list of 126 Sydney equestrians under the introduc-
tion “ the following amateur riders har e been registered”
—mean ? Can it signify that these local Mazeppas—some
of whom are well-known in sassiety—want to go in for the
professional jacket and cap ? And if not, what do they
want to be registered for—like poodles in the Spring ?
Rev. Grubb has shaken the [dust of Sydney' from his
feet after having fought a great fight. The elect left
behind now hold meetings which ail those spiritually
stirred up by the prophet are cordially invited to attend.
But the meeting that ensnares my patronage will be the
mass meeting of sufferers through landladies, servants,
wives, and housekeepers generally rushing off to Grubb
and thereby sowing the seeds of hunger and despair in
many a happy home. For instance, one high priestess of
rechauffe got Grubb very severely, and on the day of the
dear man’s last stance she dropped in casually at the
various business addresses of her boarders and told them
that as she and her daughters were going to the last
appearance of the disciple, he (boarder) would have to
forage round for his own tea when he got home. She had
left the cold mutton where the cat really couldn’t reach
it without getting on the table, and she was sure Mr.
Blank would make himself comfortable, &e. And then
there was the other hash-house Grubb-worshipper who
politely asked her gentlemen if they “ could be home to
tea by five o’clock?—the meetings begin so early.”
The first day of the cavalry tournament on flower-bed
decorated Rosehill racecourse was on 22nd inst., but,
owing to the funeral of the late Sir John Hay happening
the same afternoon, many “ representative ” persons were
unavoidably not there, and their female relatives largely
went a-missing also. Lord Jersey rose not in the East
either, but H.E. was represented in a ddgag6, off-the-
chain sort of way by Goschen (victor in the polo event)
and Chumley, who, by the way, was the chameleon of the
day, so far as changes of free-and-easy raiment went.
“’Ow the Guv’ner’s young men do enjoy theirselves when
’is Hexcellency isn’t ’ere,” said someone behind me. But
other people’s attire was more orthodox. The Throck-
morton girls looked cool in white muslin frocks, with
white kid shoon en suite ; Miss Dangar wore black silk,
with a black hat larded with chiffon ; Mrs. Wrench in
figured electric-blue : Mrs. Spalding in pink ; Miss Spald-
ing also in the hue of the plaintive water-melon. Another
pretty girl was in pink muslin, spotted over with white, and a
flat black hat with pink aggravations, but somebody with
a face the hue of a new half-sovereign had recklessly got
itself up in Australian blue. Of course, the effect was
like the golden moon rising over a forget-me-not bush.
The second and last day of the Intercolonial military
outbreak at Rosehill racecourse was a V.R. effervescence
with Gov. Jersey (he had substituted a black necktie for
his usual blue slip-knot, by which the crowd knew he was
mourning for the late Prince per medium of his habili-
ments) in a square, flower-hung box in the centre of the
stand. And just here, on this very ink-spot, I want to say
that enthusiastic committees should wrestle with the mad
longing to frame their beloved Quv’nor in green stuff.
The smell of various pungent vegetables giving up the
ghost in the sun has made more than one vice-regal
woman sorry hubby was so popular, for there are half-a-
dozen headaches and a nerve-crisis hidden in one cluster
of withering ferns for some people. There was no vice-
regal lady at Rosehill, of course, but Lady Charles Scott
with Mrs. M‘Neil and Miss Ryan were there, and
would have lit up the scene had they not been
wearing half-mast toilets. Lady Scott was in black
with a little silver braid about it, wide black hat
trimmed with chiffon; her sister in a white gown
with blouse spotted in black, white pique jacket and
black hat with coronet of violets ; Mrs. Mac Neil, In white
embroidered mull muslin with scarf of black chiffon and
black hat with chiffon bows—all very correct, but too
etohy in effect to get there chromatically. Ancrum,
Goschen, and Chumley squired the Governor’s party,
which was under the personal aegis of Loigi Precedence
Scott in a mourning suit of black and grey, betting-man
checks and a set of black studs, looking like inky tears of
woe that had congealed on his dickey. There was an
enormous frothy crowd on the grand-stand, but none of
the garments exactly soothed my savage breast. All the
pretty frocks seemed to have missed all the pretty women,
and I am not going to rage like a molar-toothache over
the beauties of a moire antique on a kite-shaped female
who would manage to look ill aD ease and oppressed by
her dressing if she simply had on the woven apron of
Ujiji belledom.
In the field, matters were lively on both days, and the
Judges must have had a trying time, for, to the lay
observer, the contests seemed very equal. The Victorian
militaires were gorgeous examples of the quantity of gold-
cord one man can carry without hurting himself, and
wfiy an eagleAould have looked one of them straight in
tlie uniform without gffiuUbliiTcP— but the new array of
the N.S.W. defenders, russet-brown with a deep V of red
in front, struck me as being an unhealthy design for any
soldier. The glaring frontal contrast seemed to me
nothing more or less than a pointer as to the whereabouts
of tlie warrior’s vital parts—but then, I know T so little
about soldiering, and the defenders of N.S.W. perhaps
mean not to get hit in front, so possibly it doesn’t
matter a hit. The greased men wrestling on horse-back
took an encore—and apropos of these, a myopic young-
lady, sitting out the show with a male friend, watched
these basted youths trying to pull one another off per
medium of any hold they could get, and when one caught
the other by the top of his continuations, she cried,
“Oh ! now he has him by the neck, hasn’t he?” And the
Johnny replied, hesitatingly, •“ Er—yes—that is by the
neck of his trousers.”
If temperance folk want more men to embrace ginger-
pop principles, why do they let fierce, advanced females
pervade all their little sprees and mob the festive teapot
at the rate of two to one? At those naughty public
affairs where “hard tack ” is introduced ladies are gently
relegated to the mat, or the galleries, hut directly a cup
of tea steams in the offing there ensues a mad rush of
women, and each male (I don’t call the tame curates
males) feels as if the cold hand of his molher-in-law had
him by the nape of the neck. Then wild and aggressive
females wag lantern jaws over the muffins until the flies
fall dizzily into the oleomargarine. It is a great pity the
local optionists don’t “ shoo ” their lady disciples away
from the coffee-urn of camaraderie. One tough she-
teetotaller with a reservoir of flowing English is enough
lo scare an army of converts into the middleof next week
A Hobart correspondent tells me that the leader of the
Tasmanian Opposition and his wife wanted to give a select
garden-party to the Science Congress, hut when the day
arrived everybody rushed the affair ; notwithstanding,
Mrs. Dobson received them all as if they had been her
dearest friends. lam also told that Tasmanian society is
a-weary of a sacred lady whose latest freak is to refuse to
wear evening dress on a very special occasion. However,
let the Tasmanians forgive the poor thing ; perhaps she
has a backbone like a string of cotton-reels.
The first private assembly ball of the season at Hobart
was a disappointing affair to many, because the CuraQoa
officers and many other visitors danced with Melbourne
and Sydney girls all through the night. The pretty Tas-
manians (those that are pretty, and some are not ) are
very much disgusted at this and vow retaliation ; still, as
several of them have run the show for many long years,
it is about time they made way for others who are not yet
in the sere and yellow leaf. Of course, we know that —
“ Beauty soon will pass away ;
Virtue will for ever stay.”
Still, you can’t get thoughtless, good-looking young
fellows to see the thing in that light.
Mayor Manning has grasped the simple licensed
victualler-ish art of entertaining the sporting visitor.
When the pioneers of the Victorian Eleven recently
arrived, His Worship received them at the Town
Hall with the usual expressions of rapt ecstacy, and then
herded his guests into the big hall to hear the organ—at
which you could see the “ongwee ” oozing out of the bat-
and-ball artists. However, the good Mayor knew his
men, and so, ere Wiegand had settled to his stride, His
Worship rose solemnly and led the whole drooping gang
into the blissful regions where the fizz is ever bubbling
and the corkscrew does not rest. None of the visitors
found their way hack again to the music.
I hear that a certain dashing lieutenant of H.M.S.
Egeria (old commission) was dreadfully sold when he got
back to England as his girl, who had “sworn to be leal and
true ” wrote him a few lines to say she was going to be
married to another fellow because the pay of a navy-
lieutenant was not enough to keep, her in boots and
gloves. Poor G was rather crest-fallen at first, but
soon drowned it in the bowl, and probably by this time is
engaged to “ the only girl he ever loved.”
Governor ’Opetoun seems to be a magnet for his sisters,
cousins, and aunts, and no doubt he is gratified at having
his dismal vice-regal lot cheered and soothed by lady
relatives at frequently-recurring intervals. But as his
mother-in-law steamed into Spencer-street with a rush of
luggage to the van the other day, it’s just probable that
the thing may be getting a little over-done.
There are no external proofs in “ Uncles and Aunts” at
Sydney Criterion that the ladies of the company have
taken heed wherewith they may be clothed, but Miss
Marie Fraser looks slim and artistic in a cream gown of
emotional cut relieved with white satin brocaded in
flowers, flat white hat with trimming of white tips.
Brenda Gibson (this pretty ingenue’s face arrangements
mottled so from the heat that she looked like a fit of
infantile convulsions, on the second night) was a charming
foil in a heliotrope frock trimmed with violet velvet and
chiffon, hat en suite. By the way, when the stage is held
by ’viduals of assorted nationalities, then comes the tug
of tongue especially when the same words are repeated—
“now,” “neow,” “fon,” “fun,” “gel,” “girl,” and so
on—it sounds like another language. And (a double-
barrelled by the way) when Brough is enacting avuncular
severity is he caricaturing that übiquitous newspaper
lady ? Tell me, please.
They dance all through the summer in Maoriland, and
the local bank-clerk sometimes goes barn-darncing in
clothing that is too tight for him. A correspondent tells
me of a young man whose, that is to say, bifurcations
gave way in the shadow of the swallow tails—such a
carpet-baggy crack that the only thing left was to sit
down suddenly on the nearest bench and wait until the
guests had had enough. But the inevitable girl lay in
ambush to make him wish that the earth would open up
and swallow him, and he hadn’t sat long on fils widening
rent when a flushed damsel arose and with a lovely smile
asked him if he would be so kind as to give her her hand-
kerchief—but really—if he would excuse her—and with-
out further warning she pounced upon a piece of white
rag which might have been her mouchoir, only that ball
handkerchiefs don’t as a general thing pay out for over a
yard when you hang on to one of them. And then the
frantic victim arose with a bloodthirsty expression in his
eye that belied the flag of truce at the rear, and fled
head-first for the dressing-room.
England gives orders that colonial military officers are
to be eligible for positions in the Imperial army. Per the
usual high wire conditions, of course—the candidates to
be nominated by the handiest Governor, which means
that the Australian Yon Moltke in embryo must have had
lucky forebears who struck it rich in the days of—er—
Captain Cook if he wants to air his tactics in Her
Majesty’s onety-oneth. This ukase has been joyously
received by sassiety, and many ambitious local militaires
over the age limit (22) harbour serious thoughts of post-
dating their baptismal certificates. On dit that a young
officer—heir to a big wool-business—will be the first to
travel Bullwards after a commission.
Yours affectionately,

dollars-for a hackney, and that at the great

after the affair had been opened two days, offered
1200 dollars for a box for the rest of the week, but
even this price could not tempt oeoole to relin-

lating instead of investing—must, in a weak
moment, have backed a bill-—must have lent
people money without security or listened to some
mining stories. If so, however, he errs in historical
company. Even Shylock allowed sentiment to
overcome him.
Mr. John Lackey succeeds Sir John Hay
as President of N.S.W. Legislative Council, thus
quenching the hopes of the N.S.W. Opposition,
which thought to see that 41 political pugilist,”
Edmund Barton, desert the Ministry. By the
way, the Council presidentship is now in the gift
of the Ministry, and a bill originating in the
Council and conferring the right to elect its own
president is now before that body. It is exceed-
ingly unlikely that anything enlarging the
privileges of the Council will be done by the
Assembly.
Certain obsequious N.S.W. railway officials
who, no doubt scenting favours to come, recently
sought to raise a departmental testimonial
emphasising the beauty of the character of one of
the junior “bosses” (salary over .£500) were
cordially jumped upon by Chief Commissioner
Eddy, who sensibly ukases that all testimonials
must be postponed until the beneficiary-elect
leaves the service. This will stop the system of
phlebotomy to which the obscure and unin-
fluential railway-servant has so often had to submit
in silent helplessness.
The dull, horrid monotony of sweltering
Townsville has been broken up somewhat this week.
For a day or two there were ten separate rivers
rushing through the town, and almost the whole of
ten or twelve bye-streets were washed into the
main thoroughfare, and the main thoroughfare
was mostly washed into the sea. Nearly three-
quarters of a yard of rain came down inside 48
hours, and the rest of the yard looked, upon latest
advices, as if it might arrive at any moment. The
Catholic Church fell in, and a lot of houses melted
away, also one bridge, a lighter, a few hundred
yards of pavement, and other sundries. The
population is hard at work shovelling frogs, eels,
and slush off the roofs, and scaring the crabs off
the chimney tops, and removing the vegetation
and dead cats that are impaled on the lightning-
rod. One or two inhabitants are unaccounted
for, all the pianos are rusted, every small boy in
the town has ruined his pants by floating around
on a plank with nails in it, everybody has got his
feet wet and is troubled with prawns in his boots,
hardly anybody has had a square meal for three
days, because it is necessary to dive for the coal,
the gospel-shops won’t be tenantable for three
months, owing to the horned cattle that took
refuge there, and other troubles are too numerous
to mention.
Editor Bulletin. Sir, — In re your para-
graph of last week, let me say that the yacht
Wanderer, as a matter of fact, never reached
Sydney on her last voyage to Australia, but was
wrecked at Port Macquarie when attempting to
enter in 1851, in charge of the master of the
schooner Elizabeth Cohen (G. R. Easton), then
lying in port, who was induced to try and get her
in although she drew some feet more water than
there was on the bar. The master of the Wan-
derer (an American, named Hathaway) gave out
that Mr. Boyd (the owner) had gone ashore at
San Christoval with his gun and accompanied by
a kanaka boy, and had not been afterwards seen.
There was something very shady and mysterious
about tbe whole affair, but it seemed to be
nobody’s business at the time to initiate enquiry,
and so the matter of Mr. Boyd’s fate was never
thoroughly sifted. The probabilities are that the
facts of the case will never be known.— Truth.
Port Macquarie, 24th Jan., 1892.
It is most convenient to have a first-class
room near tram stopping places, where ladies
can rest themselves, and if they choose, have a
good cup of tea, or other refreshments. We
understand the Country Milk Co.’s “ Cascade,”
80 and 82 Elizabeth-street, near King-street, is just
the place; it is certainly the largest and best-
conducted room in Sydney, and is getting quite
the fashionable resort for afternoon tea. We also
understand that ladies who so desire can have
parcels sent there, so that they can call for them
just before taking the tram for home.*
To the inventive genius of a lady in 1843
are we indebted for the first ice-cream freezer,
but those ladies who wish to save time, labour,
and money invest in the new German Freezer.
Why ? There is no handle to turn, not half so
much ice used, and it keeps the cream firm in or
out doors. Two quarts of ice cream can be made
for Is. 6d. to Is. 9d. Send for Sydney testimonials
to T. A. Knight & Co., St. James Chambers,
King-street, Sydney, who supply the machine.

Much Ado About No-
P RINCBS S' “The Okl Guard”
Alexandra “Evangeline.”
“ Uncles and Aunts,” a farcical coxaedv
three acts, by W. Lestocq and Walter Everard
was produced for the first time in Sydney h!5,7
a crowded audience on Saturday last. This piece
belongs to the man-trap and mistaken- den itv
brand of protracted foolery, and consists m’ S
of an antique beau, and an assortment of elder) e
people who stand in the relation of guardt-m/ n
an assortment of youngish folk, who pervade the
scene with courtship and juvenile idiocy general
There is practical y no plot, and all the humour of
the piece is supplied by the fact that somebody
always mistaken for somebody else who m e,,
appears to be nobody in particular. The
ment is briefly this : a young girl loves a young
man, but her aunt refuses to receive him been !
Ins uncle withholds his consent to the union Thu
young girl (Mary Harley) is m despair,' when
assistance comes in the guise of an antiquated
suitor sent to her by her father. With her couste
Nelly Harley s aid, she persuades the old dandy
to personate her lover’s stern uncle; and thus the
ball of trouble is set a-rolhng. After this initial
absurdity it becomes impossible to trace the com
plicated entanglements, and the piece bounds
along for three acts amid a chaos of impossible
situations and improbable gyrations.

The Brough and Boucicault Com pan v
appear to have made a big find in Mr. Tom Can
n \ T' ai ' 6 sfcnk fs "s as a mixture of Thornton
Ally feloper, and Teddy Royoe—a sort of Private
Secretary come to maturity and grown old
worldliness. He has a voice full of unction and
face full of leer,’ and he makes more business
with an umbrella and a chair than a .Japanese
conjuror The dialogue is not ,
smart, and Cannam and Brough have their wori-
cut out to lift the baldness of their lines# hut thcl
do it. Brough is especially good as a mellow
baehelor with a pronounced tendency for kissing
any lady between the ages of 16 and 60, and'the
tun js fast and furious whenever he or Cannam
holds the boards. Those two genuine artistes,
Miss Romer and Miss Annie Taylor, contribute
iargtdy to the success of “Uncles and Aunts ” i„
which alleged comedy appear a number of other
people whose exploits are more or less absurd and
whose personations of the characters they assume
are more or less artistic.

Pantomime still reigns at the Royal, but
theie is already an appreciable dropping off in
the attendance ; the glitter and glory of mere
spectacle is beginning to nail upon the public-
palate, and the gods are giving but jaded attention
to the whistling song of liose Dearing, or the
dainty dancing of the Hairy Hour. The Crage
Family are yet able to excite enthusiasm, but
there must be a limit to the perpetuity of motion
of even an acrobatic lineage. Hence the “Forty
Ihieves will shortly make their last raid, and
an Italian Opera Company will impinge upon the
P* a y‘£oer s horizon, these foreign minstrels in
turn to be succeeded by the ever-bland Holt with
a melodrama with many hundred acts, and several
acres of limelight and Union Jacks.

Last Friday witnessed, at Her Majesty’s,
the final smile of the Pantomime of “Maggie
Moore in the Wood,” and the babes who ought
n to have been in it on any account; and to
night (Saturday ) a comedy-drama entitled “Forty-
nine (no lelation to the “ Horty Thieves”) will
be produced for the first time in Australia,’with,
an amount of much-advertised ever-thusness which
leaves nothing to be hoped for. We are sorrv to-
lose Maggie Moore, and Miss Bashall, and the-
lime-light man, and the “ wheels that go wound ”
in the transformation-scene, but like the young
man that was hanged the day before he was to
have been married, we hope that it will all turn
out for the best, and that nobody will be dis
appointed. We are getting tired of pantomime,
anyway.

41 His hair turned white in a single night,
and ail for eighteenpence;” but Manager Wyburd
at the Bondi Aquarium has been doing the busi-
ness for the small charge of one shilling. In
addition to the Hloating Lady and the Tank
Stream on Anniversary Hay, he secured the ser-
vices of Williamson’s Juvenile Opera Troupe, and
indulged in the luxury of presenting two operas
per diem without any serious consequences follow-
ing.

The Polytechnic is growing in public
favour as the one place of amusement where the
jaded soul can indulge the luxury of tobacco while
it contemplates the mystery of clog-darming, and
solaces itself with the spectacle of twenty alleged
American lady minstrels. Here, too, Helix Tanner
has been delighting the philosophic mind by sitting
at a table and reading on an empty stomach, and
maintaining a reasonable degree of plumpness on
the succulent desert air, but he had to leave it oft
suddenly as starvation is getting so common in
Australia that nobody would roll up to look at
him.

On Saturday (Feb. 6th) a “great inter-
tiotrd tug-of-war” is to start at Sydney
inhibition Building, when, in the thrilling lan-
hjX 0 f the advertisement, “all nations a.re
£ ua -wi to compete.” Those already on the list
lreland, Scotland, Wales, Canada,
France* Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Norway,
i Austria, Denmark, Russia, Germany,
US Australia, and Maoriland, all of which will
ha’nlat the end of a rope. The pity of it is
T t some of the most muscular races on earth
k n’t represented ; an A 1 Zulu team, if it could
hlriound at such short notice, would either haul
ihe above-mentioned crowds right out of the
K.Glrlinsr. and drag them down to Circular Quay,
”, e ]se when it got licked it would kill the
other party there and then. Business is certain
0 b 0 good while the novelty lasts, though too
luch tug-of-war, like too much fasting-man, is one
of the solemn considerations of the future.

“Much Ado about Nothing’' is going
downhill steadily at Melbourne Bijou. The
departure of Messrs. Brough and Tom Cannam
for Sydney necessitated two changes from the
original cast. Clitheroe verges nearer to dull
inanity than his predecessor, who was by no means
a successful realisation of Dogberry’s doddering
colleague, whilst James Cathoart is a stagey,
mechanical Leonato, where Brough was unusually
easy and natural. Brough walked leisurely, yet
impressively, through the part, and the veteran
,faines does it on the old “three dots and carry
ime” system. Of late, too, Percy Lyndal has put
ho much vigour into his delivery that one would as
lief hear the town crier speak his lines. It is at
the end of the second act that Percy shows most
anxiety to shout for the crowd. Being unable to
bring the curtain down on a situation (because the
Bard hasn’t provided one) he opens bis shoulders
at the upper circle, and endeavours to frighten
’em into a conviction that he’s saying something
tremendous. “ We are the only love gods ” comes
from that amiable young man’s mouth like a dis-
charge of six minute guns, each gun being more
loaded than the one before. Dash it all ! can’t
he adore the gods without trying to split their
ear-drums ?
* * * *
“ Dick Whittington ” pulled through the
sultry tug-of-war week better than the other
theatres, and had a big crowd there on Saturday
night, close upon the heels of a matinee.
Ureville’s animated bustle is quite a novel feature
of the pantomime, now that an exactly similar
piece of wholesome fun is no longer perpetrated
at the x\leck. The hinder part of Greville’s ward-
robe contains a boy, and becomes detached from
the rest of the female’s person after a while,
whereupon J.R.G. whistles to his rear-guard, and
it follows him off like a dawg. In the event of
this hidden urchin becoming a great actor, he will
look back with pride to the time when he made
his first appearance on the stage in the small, but
important, character of a dress-improver. “ Ah !
me,” he will possibly observe—for fame doesn’t
always bring contentment, nor is wealth an
infallible cure for liver complaint —“Ah! me. 1
was happier when I played the bustle.”

At Melbourne Princess’, also, there was a
considerable waking up on Saturday, when Elton
let himself loose in “ The Old Guard ” once again.
The celebrated ballet fetched the usual encore,
and those sweet girls showed no traces of fatigue
at the second time of asking. They soon kicked
over the traces, anyway. “ The Old Guard ”
seems none the worse for a withdrawal of Flora
Granpner in favour of Miss Marietta Nash (her
first appearance in Australia). The new lady has
a pretty, though weak, American voice, and
speaks very much to the point. Furthermore,
she won their affections right away with a
grotesque dance, and a certain genteel rortiness
that suits her particular style of beauty. Marietta
ought to do very nicely. Florence Young, Ida
Osborne, Howard Vernon, Ryley and Lissant are
back in their original places, likewise Bracy re-
appears in Leumane’s old part. The loss of
Leumane didn’t seem much of a calamity until
Bracy had settled down in his shoes, but if that
wandering prodigal were to return from his wattle
groves, with a repaired voice and a chastened
spirit, the public would very likely kill the fatted
calf in his honour. Meanwhile, Bracy’s polished
wooden appearance and washed-out falsetto have
!l £°od deal to do with prevailing depression.

“Evangeline” was to be staged at the*
Alexandra on Monday, so a few remarks on the
present prospects of Catherine and the Lone
fisherman and the Heifer will appear next week,
“ith a transformation-scene ready to hand if

entertainment should be revived as a full-blown
pantomime: “Evangy Rangy Pudding and Pie,
915 Harlequin the Magic Cow and the Man in the

Hans Phillips, an estimable actor and gen-
woman, who has lately been down with rheumatic

gratis, and the purfesh in general will buy seats
or the occasion and sit around in this good cause,

Music and the drama, and the nno arts,
th n Hme in Melbourne last week. Also
ae Circus made a gloomy reduction in prices, and
everal of the trained horses fell down for want
j* 1 Ppolic support. Every evening the city surged
‘P m a great, sweltering mob to the Exhibition
m 5 and sat gasping at a series of dazzling
pectaeles. A long, narrow platform had been
reeled under the dome. On the platform stood a
; ost w ith a hole in it, and through the hole a
r °P e was drawn, and attached to either end of the
Pe lay ten men, with the monotonous regu-
ofritA °f two strings of sausages. Each lot
f r ten was alleged to consist solely of patriots
,jJ? a Particular country, and the burning
, Sl l e °f every patriot was to weigh as
lcfl as possible and hang on to the rope as
hard as he could, for the honour of his native land.
Many nations were represented, and sometimes
the pair of rival powers immediately upon the
job would weigh so much alike and pull so ridicu-
lously similar that the rope simply stiffened itself
out and remained motionless as a corpse for an
hour right off. At these stonewalling times the
excitement of the vast congregation gradually
waned. A sort of cloud came over the entertain-
ment, and everybody seemed to lapse into mourn-
ing for the Duke of Clarence. But the nation
with the larger number of blisters on its fingers
would finally yield the requisite seven feet
of rope, and then a calico banner, dis-
playing the name of the victorious country
would be jerked along a clothes-line amidst
the jubilations of the populace. Occasion-
ally the tug-of-war was a simple matter
oh both sides. The Americans, or Irish, for
instance, would lie and hold the rope as though
they were a fishing-party, and directly they got a
bite they hauled in. The captured prey might
wriggle a bit, but it was poor, unevent'ul sport
for the anglers, anyway. As a feast for the intel-
lect of the looker-on this sort of encounter was,
however, superior to a stubborn contest, except for
those who had turned it into a gambling trans-
action, and backed the poor'fish. To thoroughly
enjoy a tug-of-war you must be an Irishman
or a Pole, or a native of any other country where
the heel of oppression has imprinted a strong
desire to get up and howl for your native soil.
Then you must make a point of seeing that your
compatriots can beat all the other peoples of the
earth at rope-pulling, and if you subsequently dis-
cover that the nationality of each team is hope-
lessly mixed and the glory of the conquerors
scattered all over the globe, so to speak—well, it
doesn’t much matter. The main idea is to feel
your bosom swell with pride at the time, and get
drunk for the sake of the dear old land.

The regular attendance of Janies Cassius
Williamson to witness these tagging operations,
together with his reputation for knowing the
ropes, caused it to be rumoured abroad that he
held a third share in the speculation. His interest
in the affair was purely sentimental, however.

LYRICS OF THE STAGE.
(THE HEAVY VILLAIN’S SNEER.)
We’ve sampled villains by the score
Upon the modern stage,
We’ve seen them shedding human gore
In youth and middle age ;
Old, musty villains we have met
Whom mocking gods have “ guyed.”
We've never seen a monster yet
Who didn’t sneer (aside).
One villain had a raven wig,
Another’s hair was gray —
This villain was morose and big,
That small and full of play.
Their had deserts they always got,
They usu ally died,
But ne’er an one of all the lot
Forgot to sneer (aside).
Some villains sported choice attire
And patent-leather boots,
And some were objects to admire
In knickerbooker suits.
They plotted plots with subtle skill,
Suspicion they defied,
And seemed like decent people till —
Ha! ha ! —they sneered (aside).
’Twas thus they gave themselves away
And advertised their sin.
The villain of the modern play
Is very weak and thin.
To find a cause, from time to time
The hard has vainly tried,
Why men involved in secret crime
Delight to sneer (aside).
It is not done in real life—
The villain deep in guilt,
Who robs his pal and chokes his wife,
Is differently built;
Although his heart be cold as ice,
And inches thick his hide,
He scorns that old dramatic vice
He never sneers (aside).

The Newcastle (N.S.W.) police lately made a big mistake
by arresting J. Summers, William Rignold’s business-
manager, on a false charge of wife-desertion. Mr.
Summers happens to be a bachelor—and the error arose
through mistaken identity.
One of the curiosities of Bathurst (N.S,W.) is the old
theatre in Durham-sfcreet, relic of the gold era. It has
stage, d.c., and pit still intact, though the walls are un-
safe. On its ancient board shone G. V. Brooke and all
the great lights of his day.
The catalogue given to visitors to the hulk Success
states that the bushranger, “Gipsy Smith,” was hanged
for the murder of his wife in April, ’6l. This is not
correct. Gipsy Smith died in the Melbourne hospital;
Smith was taken in hand after his discharge from prison
by Mr. Lang, a son of Dr. Lang, who entrusted him with
mobs of cattle from N.S. Wales to the Melbourne market.
The programme of the RAaliste Theatre, Paris, the
management and actors of which have just been sent to
gaol, was indeed a shocker. A correspondent has sent us
the programme, of which the barest hint cannot here be
conveyed even in French.
Compagnoni’s Hotel, Pitt-street, Sydney, bought as an
office-site by the City Bank Co., has an history. Thirty-
years ago it was the Shakespeare Tavern and was kept by
Tom Spencer, the clever mechanician of the Polytechnic.
In the days of the old Yic. the Shakespeare was presided
over by the well-known Polly Smith, who shared with
“Bob” Horne, a door or two lower down, the patronage of
the men about town.
One dark and stormy night recently a travelling com-
pany were billed to play some blood-and-thunder melo-
drama in a country town in New South Wales. When
the show should have commenced, the manager found
that the audience consisted of one solitary man in the
“ bob part.” The audience was offered his money back,
but he refused it and insisted on his rights, saying he
had ridden 30 miles and lamed his favourite mare, in
response to an invitation contained in the management’s
circular, and he had to see that show. The law was on
his side, and the company was compelled to act. All the
artists decided to do their very slummiestand worst, which
caused the audience to exercise his critical right, and he
hissed like 17 different kinds of ganders. Then a happy
thought struck the manager. He sent for the local police
force', and when he arrived had his audience ejected from
the theatre for disturbing the performance. Then the
manager and the leading lady went and liquidated the
receipts while props locked up the theatre.
Elton really goes to London this Easter. The little
man will show up the other little man.
Hans Phillips, sick these three months of rheumatic
fever, gets a matinee hen., at Melbourne Bijou, this
afternoon (Saturday)— “ Much Ado.” Hans has been 20
years on the hoards, hut never took a benefit. He
married a daughter of John Hennings. His father,
Alfred Phillips, was a well-known English entertainer,
and his mother was the true successor of Mrs. Glover, in
.’ 1, . Malaprop, and the like.
Madame Carandini has the ill-lucK to fall under the
up is tree of financial shade, wherefore Coppin, William-
son, and others, are taking steps to square her finances,
with a testimonial. More or less of misfortune has dogged
the whole family, and who does not recollect the brilliant
quartette of Madame, Rosina, Fannie, and Lizzie ?
indeed, there was a musical fifth , Tennie. Madame
Carandini was the original Fra Diavolo, in Melbourne.
Signor Carandini was a dancer, and appeared in the Mel-
bourne Royal Pantomime, 1855, as Harlequin.
Gwendolen Floyd writes a big backward hand, some-
what like Nellie Stewart’s, and quite overthrows the
ordinary writing prognosticator prophets.
Cecil Ward, of B. and 8., is married, not to a young
lady on the stage. On the marriage-evening a horseshoe
bouquet was handed up to him, in the Cathedral-scene of
“ Much Ado About Nothing,” but such things are an im-
pertinence to the audience, when they are not aware of
the circumstances.
J. C. Williamson is in negotiation with Miss Marlowe, a
leading actress who is the present U.S. rage, in legitimate
drama, the Mary Anderson of the day, praised in glowing
terms by Madame Bernhardt.
Augustus Harris says the most expensive opera lie lias
mounted is Gounod’s “ Romeo and Juliet,” but it was the
best paying—with Melba. Last season he came out only
just right, with over £BO,OOO on either side of the ledger.
Philip Newbury, a Maoriland singer of great promise, is
about to appear in Italian opera at the Shaftesbury
Theatre, London. Mr. Newbury is the son and heir of a
pastry-cook located in George-street, Dunedin. He is
small and fat, and suffers from an impression that he
owns the earth. The present writer met him first at a
secluded card-party, and when the gifted singer had lost
sundry shillings he got up on his ear and wanted to
wreck the premises, and then he chased the principal
winnerinto the street, and was only withheld from violence
by the most strenuous exertions on the part of the com-
pany.
W. G. Willis, the dramatist, the announcement of whose
death was lately cabled, was an uncommonly open-
hearted fellow. It is said that he used to keep his money
in his chambers in a tobacco-jar, and that his needy
friends were always welcome to help themselves as long
as the supply lasted. The only thing that ever astonished
him was the fact of any of his friends returning any such
loans.
The plucky Madame Simousen, after exploiting Europe
tor an opera company, failed to make it pay, and is teach-
ing music again. Her staging—very Punch-aud-Judyish
—did much damage, but it must be admitted that she
selected a most excellent team and dropped into dread-
fully depressed times.
There is quite an epidemic of “babbies” both coming
and come amongst the ladies of the profession in London.
We have already heard of Mrs. Langtry’s hopes in that
respect, and now a certain stately married woman has
had to take her name out of the Gaiety bill for the same
interesting reason. Better than all a certain dancer, very
popular in Australia, has had a baby. A popular manager
is the author of this work. Whose turn next?
There must be some money knocking about London,
remarks our correspondent, under date 18th December,
despite the almost universal complaint of hard times.
Not a seat is to be had for the 'premiere of “ Cinder-
Bllen,” all places having been booked, or given away,
three or four weeks ago. The same may be said of the
first night of the “ Mountebank.” As for the Lyceum, it
is hopeless ever to expect to get a seat at a first per-
formance, or even at a revival, unless by the greatest
favour.
Scotland provided a palpable swindle at Melbourne tug-
of-war. They pulled Italy over, but one elephantine
Caledonian had strapped himself to the rope as an easy
method of relieving his biceps, and Maocaroni, protesting,
was given the pull. Next night, Scotland sulked and
wouldn’t pull anyone.
Teddy Royce foregoes a benefit for re-appearance in
burlesque, beginning with “Jack Sheppard” at Mel-
bourne Royal.
John Hennings is painting, by order of Melbourne
Exhibition trustees, a cyclorama of Old Melbourne, to he

Felix Tanner, who started on a 50 days’ fast at Sydney,

medical men would attend and certify to the bona-fides of
the fast. Thank Heaven !
Gerald and Duff, who were accused of having eloped
from Broken Hill with the proceeds of a benefit which
they had given to the local Fire Brigade, have entered
libel-suit against the newspapers which published the
rumour. Their story is that they volunteered a benefit
to the brigade, the agreement being that they should
deduct the expenses, and hand over the balance. The
cash takings at the doors were £25 ; tickets representing
£23 were also taken at the doors, the latter amount being
for tickets sold by members of the brigade and which
were never in the possession of Gerald and Duff at all.
The £25 taken at the doors did not cover the actual
expenses of the night. The brigade, which took no risk,
benefited to the extent of £34, and never thanked Gerald
and Duff for it, hut assisted, so it is claimed, in slander-
ing them.
Ohas. Mathews, barrister, figures in a group of portraits
in the last Sporting and Dramatic News. Adopted son
of old Charley Mathews, real son of Davenport, Mrs.
Mathews’ first husband, American actor, but it is wonder-
ful what a likeness Barrister Mathews shows to old
Charley, who was very fond of him. He acted in Mel-
bourne, with his step-father, in ‘ A Bachelor of Arts,’
afterwards becoming Montagu Williams’ pet barristerial
pupil.
Fifty-two was the number of journalists on Coppin’s
free list, Melbourne Royal, when he issued his cutting
down circular for the Panto. Then there are their
sisters, cousins, and aunts. We revive again our legend
of the 120 journalists who went in one night to see the
charms of Gvmnaste Lottie, in the little St. George’s
Hall, and their united total resulted in one three-line
notice.
The Austral Gardens, Melbourne’s new Cremorne, are
pushed on, the site being on the Yarra, opposite old
Cremorne, the Coppinian. What starts the job is the
prodigious success of Sells and the Tug of War. The
plana show a superb place.
Poussard scored an enormous success at Hobart, his
Scottish fantasia being received with the wildest
enthusiasm. Poussard should don a kilt.
Apolline Niay, the clever young English pianiste, is

At Sydney Theatre Royal the Cragg family of athletes
take off their coats. But when the wonderful acrobats
appeared before “ Wales” they didn’t dare to remove the
garment for fear H.R.H. should take offence. A partially-

When the McMahons were up in Bananaland prospecting
for “ the beautiful Evangeline,” they treated the reporters
to half-crown cigars, a phonograph and Burke’s whisky
(one of the brethren sometimes carried a flask in his
breast-pocket). “Evangeline” on the first night was
received with a howl of disappointment, yet the well-fed
local scribes gave it a column-and-a-half of unctuous
praise, describing it as “ the most magnificent comic
opera ever seen i;i Hid colonies.” One of the critics, wh.i
wrote a big notice, was asked on the quiet what he
thought of. the show, and he said sadly that it was
“ damned had.” Is it any wonder that managers secretly
despise the “art critic ” in Australia?
Meston, who has lately been on the track of blacks for

After the first six nights of “Robinson Crusoe” —
skilfully dished up by Essex-Evans— it was plain that
financial ruin was lurking round Brisbane Opera House.
In the middle of the performance one night in the second
week, when the ghost had refused to walk, two or three
principals in the leg-show would not come, up to the
mark, upon which they were soundly lectured by Jennie
Lee. The performance dragged its weary length along
until the-curtain finally fell over “The Birth of Love.”
The girls then mobbed Beverley, who made up his mind
to close the house, “ owing to the illness of Mr. Hickie.”
One lady (who cgn throw clothes-brushes with deadly

counsel prevailed, and some days afterwards she took

Johnnie Wallace thinks there’s money in the Brisbane

Peter Redmond, digger, who died of thirst
in the Murchison (VV. A.) bush, the other day, and
was found naked alongside his empty water-bags,

It is rumoured that Sir William Jervois
may come back to Maoriland for another term as

At the Wallsend N.S.W. Colliery, when a
ballot was taken on the advisability of striking,
out of over 800 members only 406 rolled up to
record their votes. This tendency to shirk
exercising the duty of the franchise at critical
junctures is one of the most disheartening features
of democratic progress. What’s the use of fighting
for self-government if the democracy is too tired
to use the right when it gets it ?
The one really thrilling feature about
Stanley’s last big book is that he wrote it naked.
He took a house at Alexandria, and settled down
there to do his literary job in peace, far from the
madding crowd ; and he kept a nigger-boy to
scare off visitors. But one day a stranger per-
sauded the small African to take in his card, and
after he had waited a while in an ante-room the
great explorer came in smiling, clad in abso-
lutely nothing save a pen behind his ear. He
remarked cheerfully that it was a hot day, and
then just as he was going to sit down he suddenly
recollected the deficiencies of his costume, and
uttering an affrighted exclamation he fled out of
the door. A few minutes later he came back in
full attire and explained that he had grown so
accustomed in Central Africa to fly light in the
matter of clothes that he couldn’t get out of the
habit. Whether he'still retains the custom in
his hours of seclusion, and whether the Much-
Travelled Smythe does the same as a compliment
to his tame explorer, are among the unsettled
problems of history.
The great war between Chili and Peru is
already ancient history, but on the battlefield of
Tarapaoa, in the desert, the dead are still lying
just as they fell. There were four thousand of
them and nearly a thousand horses all left
unburied, for the Chilians were marching through
a horrible region of drought and death, and
had no time to dig sepulchres. But it never
rains on Tarapaca, and the sun has dried the
corpses and the nitrates in the soil have preserved
them, and up on the plateau five thousand
mummies lie in picturesque confusion with their
broken swords and bayonets, all as fresh-looking
as ever. There is no single bird or beast or
insect in that horrible desolation, and if nobody
interferes with the relics the Peruvians of the
century after next can call round and find their
dead great-grandfathers sitting up there as good
as new. But according to the stories that are
current in Valparaiso, the hair of the dead men
and the dead horses keeps on growing, till the
manes and moustaches and whiskers of that un
shaved army average some three feet or more in
length. Therefore, some day, an expedition will
probably go up and shear that deceased host, and
sell the defunct Peruvian’s beard to make bangs
and frizzes for the girls of Europe, and pay a big
dividend out of the enterprise. In fact, we an

Some of the worst enemies the Maoriland
colonists had to contend with during the war were
Englishmen, and perhaps the worst of all these'
was one Moffatt —from whom the Maoris learned
how to make gunpowder. Moffatt, who is said to
have been the nephew of Dr. Moffatt, the African
traveller, had at one time served in the British
army as an officer, and, according to report, was
estimated by English society as a most agreeable
and handsome young man; but nevertheless,
when he reached Wanganui he was soon set down
as a very undesirable colonist. He led an aban
doned life, and became so necessitous that he was
forced to make a home with the Maoris at a pah
up the Wanganui River. At this time the Upper
Wanganui tribes were hostile to the whites, and
Moffatt earned fame amongst them by teaching
them the arts of civilised warfare, which included
the making of gunpowder. Fame did not seem
to agree with Moffatt; he became an egotist, and
boasted that the most barbarous of Maori tribes
would receive him with open arms. This attack
of “ swelled head ” caused his death. He was
shown splendid specimens of gold, brought down
by Maoris from the Tnhua country. The Tuhuas
were pre-eminently hostile to the whites, and had
warned all pakehas to keep out of their country
on pain of death. “That means all whites hut
Moffatt, the Maoris’ friend,” said Moffatt, who,
setting out upon a prospecting expedition to the
T country, which lies in the vicinity of the
I ■ .hug mountains. Tongariro and Ruapehu, was
shot, and was relieved .of his heart, tongue and
eyes, delicacies for the Maori epicure.

Rudyard Kipling’s indifference to the

The Secretary of State has, as a special
compliment, permitted Sir Alfred Stephen
(resigned) to retain the parchment-certificate of
his appointment as N.S.W. Lieutenant-Governor.
The predecessor of Sir John Hay as Presi-
dent of the N.S.W. Legislative Council, T. A.
Murray, had a private funeral. Hay had a semi-
public one. Why ? Murray was poor; Hay
rich.
W. H, Tietkins, the well-known explorer,
was pressed to join Lindsay’s expedition when it
was organised, but declined owing to the com-
position of the party. Tietkins scented trouble
very correctly.
It is said that Gladstone’s fee for adver-
tising the soap-works of a certain enterprising
firm was ,£10,000: paid not, of course, personally
to the G.0.M., but as a subscription to the Central

Sir Jas. M‘Culloch resigns his London

Berry beat him after all—Berry, the darling of
Hatfield House, the cane-twiddler on the Carlton

Chief Justice Higinbotham will probably

Were there an election, he would be President of
the Australian Republic. No man living would

“ If there is a black spot on the map of
England it is St. Helena,” said Deputy-Speaker
Ninian Melville to the amazement of N.S.W.
Legislative Assembly. No wonder Melville is
fathering a Free Education Bill.
A feature of the Hobart Science Congress
was Baron Von Mueller and his immaculate com-
forter. Likewise the manner in which he took
leave of the members of each section in which he
was interested. He wept oceans every time.
Randolph Churchill cabled across to the
Daily Graphic (his contract with them for a
series of eighteen letters, at £ 100 each, having
expired): “Shall I send more letters—same

Charles Gavan Duffy has drawn £27,000
in pension from the Victorian taxpayer, and still

these pensioners do live! How many men long
underground have pitied poor, sickly, squeaky
Duffy!
C. E. Bright, C.M.G. —Lord Canterbury’s
son-in-law —was present at the farewell dinner
given to Graham Berry in London. Time was, in
Old Melbourne, when the Brights would have
been glad to see Berry strung up on the nearest
lamp-post.
Mr. Joseph Newman, one of the most
prominent teetotal advocates in Maoriland, died
the other day at Auckland from the effects of
drink. A big whisky-advertisement fell on his
head at a railway station, and he never recovered
from the effects.
Sir Henry Parkes relates that ivhenever a
politician came to urge his claim to a title he
took care to explain that he didn’t want the title
for himself but for his wife. However, there was
an exception to this rule: one politician wanted
the title to please his sister,
Parkes’ gastronomical weakness is tomatoes
and sugar. When going a long railway journey
he, whenever tomatoes are procurable, gets a ease
of the finest ones possible, and at frequent inter-
vals cuts the fruit into slices, and piles each slice
up with as much sugar as will rest on it.
Sir Henry Parkes used to contribute from
Sydney “pomes” to the Launceston Examiner
(Tas.) nearly 50 years ago. One set of verses was
preceded by the remark : “In the absence of any
meritorious local productions we publish the fol-
lowing from the pen of a Sydney correspondent.”
It has just been elicited that when Super-
intendent Hare left Melbourne on the trip which
ended in the extermination of the Kelly Gang, it
was suggested to him at Spencer-street railway
station that a pilot engine should precede the
police train. “What’s a pilot-engine ?” queried
Hare.
Gustaf Dillberg and J. A. Philp, of Syd-
ney, inventors of a new printing- process, and
whose patent was opposed in England by the
powerful Linotype company, have come out on
top, the court having decided that the Dillberg-
Philp patent shall be allowed to stand, as a dis-
tinct novelty in the art of printing.
Allen, the author of the American Home-
stead Law, a measure which gave 100 acres of
land to anyone who guaranteed to settle on it,
died the other day in an Ohio infirmary, aged
81 years, while subscriptions were being raised all
over the country for him. He had been—he loved
the shears—a tailor and a newspaper editor.
John Kopp, of the famous Connecticut
(XJ.S.) Suicide Club, who had attended nearly aJ
the funerals of self-slaughtered members, has gone
to the tomb after their fashion. The club had
originally 20 members, but two only are now left;
all the rest have committed feo de sc. Poisoning
and drowning are against the rules as being too
easy.
When Agent-General Bray (8,A.) first
stood for East Adelaide twenty years ago, one
of the touts in an exciting contest paraded a
donkey through Adelaide with the inscription
‘‘ Vote for Bray.” Bray always maintained that
it was his singular name which Hist put him into
Parliament.
There -was an edifying spectacle in an
Adelaide restaurant the other day. A well-known
skinflint, a millionaire citizen, ordered two
penn’orth of cake on which he made his lunch. A
minute or two later you could see this millionaire
crawling under the table to recover the penny
change, which he had dropped on the floor !
“Augur” Chapman has left the Aus-
tralasian, under almost the same circumstances
as his predecessor, cricketing Hannnersley—each
served about 18 years. “ Augur’s ’’ writing gave

that of any of the other horseographs. Neverthe-
less he was a Bell’s Life comp., as “Orange

DISTRESS.
PROGRESS.
PROSPERITY.
Potts, who gave his name to Potts Point,
Sydney, was an early day accountant of the Bank
of N.S.W. He devised a system of interest cal-
culations, which was the vade-mecum of Sydney
accountants in the Thirties and Early Forties.
Darling Point, the habitat of the bloated Sydney
aristocrat, is an abbreviation of Mrs. —not Lady—
Darling’s Point.
Of the six men who have held office as
President of N.S.W. Legislative Council since
May, 1856 Alfred Stephen, John Hubert
Plunkett, William Westbrooke Burton, William
Charles Wentworth, Terence Aubrey Murray and
John Hay—the first holder of the office is the only
one still alive. The first four were lawyers ; the
last two died in office.
Graham Berry was once, for a short while,
worth <£30,000. Some of his friends allotted him
shares at opening prices in Ballarat and Reedy
Creek mines. His “Madam Berrys” cost him
Bs. and rose to .£23, when lie sold out. Then he
tried specs, on his own judgment, and the bottom
fell out of his luck. Berry, at 70 years of age, is
again a poor man.
The unintelligent comp, is as bad in his
corrections as in his blunders. Edward Ellis, of
Melbourne Herald, one day wrote some allusion
to “the Spanish succession.” The comp, soon
came down and said: “Look, Mister Ellis,
you’ve made a mistake. You write ‘ Charles the
Fifth’; that can’t be, as there was none after
Charles the Second.”
Sir J. D. Paul, the London banker, who
was awarded, with his partners, fourteen years for
fraud, was the author of “Ruth : a Poem,” “A
Harmony of Scripture,” and “Short Lessons for
Young Christians.” A Victorian bank-teller who
misappropriated .£2OOO used to keep a detailed
account of his peculations in a spare copy of a
Sunday-school class-register.
The cable which bores us with the news
of the death of every trumpery princelet and
every titled flunkey omitted to note the decease of
Charles Kingsley’s widow. She wrote “ Yeast ”
from her husband’s dictation, and copied “Alton
Locke ” for the press ; and the “ Chartist Parson ”
never hid his indebtedness to her largeness of
heart and brain. “Lucas Mallet,” one of the
rising novelists of the day, is a daughter of the
Kingsleys.
The death of Emile de Laveleye, the most
popularly-sympathetic representative of the new-
economic school, was allowed to pass with fifteen
lines of original comment by the daily papers of
the three principal cities of Australia. His work
on “ Luxury,” alone, if studied by every Austra-
lian workman, would revolutionise sociological
politics in Australasia. Do Laveleye’s separate
publications, which range from two-volume works
to eight-page pamphlets, and number seventy-five,
have appeared in the English, Russian, French,
German, Italian, Spanish and Swedish languages.
To the late Sir John Hay is due the credit
of having saved the maniac O’Farrell from the
hands of the Sydney mob at Clontarf. The lunatic
had been got on board the steamer when a wild
shriek of “ Lynch him !” was raised. The steamer
was a few feet from the wharf when the crowd
called upon the skipper to put back. He was
about to do so when Sir John—then plain Mister
—who was on tire bridge, peremptorily ordered
him “full speed ahead,” and he was obeyed. Sir
John was about the only prominent man who did
not lose his head that day.
Bir John Hay made his first big lun.p of
money out of a partnership with “Buck” Cock-
burn and Mat. Hervey, the well-known down
South pastoralists. Hay used to travel Port
Phillip country to buy bullocks and send them to
the Gippsland run of the firm, whence they used
to bo drafted in spans for teamsters. The
“ breaking-out of the gold” made a just paying-
concern into a gold-mine itself. Hay was the
only man of the triumvirate who stuck to his coin
for any length of time. Hervey died a mere
stock-inspector while touring a run formerly held
by himself—it was supposed from thirst.
According to an American publisher,
Rudyard Kipling, says London Figaro, “ wants
a dollar a word ’’ —that is to say A 2 per ordinary
newspaper line, or much over £ lOOO per Bulletin
page—“ for his stories.” Of course he does. He
wants as much as be can get. But no man in the
history of the world has ever got half the money.
Why, Charles Dickens wrote “ Hunted Down
a say, 20-column story—for a New York paper,
and got =£looo for it, which up to date is the
record price, so far as we have ever heard. Even
Tennyson did not get paid at the Kipling rate for
his charming little poem, “Crossing the Bar.”
The father of E. F. Hughes, the West
Victorian newspaper man, was a poet—a poet
among poets; for the bulk of his master-piece,
“The Millennium,” was not written at all, but
was literally “ composed at case”—each line being
“set-up” by the author in type as he arranged
the words. When “The Millennium” was com-
pleted, a complimentary copy was sent by the
author to that fine old pioneer, “ Frank” Henty,
and the poet eagerly awaited the ancient’s judg-
ment. At last the scribbler met the squatter.
“How do I like your poem, Mr. Hughes? Well
—h’m—ah—to tell you the truth, I am of opinion
that to be thoroughly appreciated, it will have to
be read in the millennium. One pain more or less
then won’t matter!”
Earl Jersey doesn’t seem to be a lucky
litigant. Way back in ’B9 he obtained a decree
for £633 costs against the Uxbridge Sanitary
Union, and ever since then his lawyers have been
vainly trying to get the amount from the U.S.U.
The fi.st effoit was to annex some special funds
belonging to the Union, and when this attempt
failed—with costs against his Excellency—the
lawyers laid legal hands on some land in the
possession of the Union. But the Court has
decided that Jersey’s costs are not to come out of
this asset, and the process has been set aside with
more costs against H.E. And now the judges
seem to think that it is not a good year for
Jersey’s costs, and doubt whether there is any
portion of the Union property that can be made
liable for the judgment.
J, G. Knight, the recently - dece t ased
Government Resident in the Northern Territory,
was a man of great resource. When he was in
business as an architect in Melbourne in the
fifties he erected the Criterion Hotel in Collins-
street, and Moss, the flaring Yankee who owned
the place, insisted on gilt balconies as part of the
adornments. The work was to be finished at a
certain time, and Knight found, almost at the last
moment, that the ornamental iron-work required
couldn’t be got for love or money anywhere nearer
than England. Moss nearly went into fits over
the delay, so Knight peacefully bought up all th«
iron bedsteads available, and cut the posts inn.
balcony-rails. It was a desperately expensive
device, but Moss’ hotel was ready at the contract
Alfred Deakin doesn't think much 0 f
American orators, and when in the States f rp
quently remarked how disappointed he felt with
such specimens of the Yankee jawster as } le

citizen to him, “you think we have no orators
Just you go to the City Hall this evening and
hear the chief speaker—one of the most eloquent
men who has ever lived, sir.” Deakin went and
crowded into a front seat. The occasion was the
making of a presentation to a mercantile magnate
in formally introducing whom the orator of the
evening (the local Mayor) said : “We have met
together, fellow Americans, to do honour to a man
who has done more to join the commerce of the
Atlantic with that of the Pacific than any other
living man to do honour to a man whose name is
a household word wherever the flag of our fore
fathers flies " And then (aside to the hem ’
fieiary): “Say, hell, what is your name?”
The publication of Burke’s Colonial
Gentry has revived once more the old question--
which is, after all, not a question at all—who was
Margaret Oatchpole?” One of her alleged
descendants—most assiduous in the repudiation of
descent from the celebrated and enterprising lady
—has informed “Burke” that his grandmother
was Mary , of a certain county ; but he
protests too much. When his grandmother wrote
to Bishop Broughton and asked him to correct a
statement which he had made identifying her
with Madame Margaret, he replied that he was
bound to accept her assertion that she was born in
another and more northern county of England
As a matter of fact, why should anybody object
to being regarded as a descendant of Margaret
Oatchpole? Lots of people who hold their heads
high to-day because of their alleged untainted
ancestry have no instance in the list of their
ancestors’ achievements of any act one-hundredth
part as noble as that which brought the heroine
under the ban of the law.
John Nicholson, S.M., of South Australia,
who stands a fair show of being appointed
Government Resident of the Northern Territory
was originally a Victorian State-school teacher!
He had the most erratic notions as to when
“ leave ’’ began and when it ended. Jack’s rela-
tions with the department were constantly
strained, and the officials were not at all sorry
when he gave himself wholly up to the fascina-
tions of a love with whom he had occasionally
toyed during his scholastic career—journalism.
By-and-bye he drifted into the editorship of the
Port Augusta Despatch, S.A., and thence
became a power in the wheat-land. The Wesleyan
interest has always had a sneaking regard for
Jack, though it cannot be said that he was ever a
particular ornament of the class-meeting. He was
one of the coterie of mutual admirationists which
—starting from Brown Hill, Ballarat—have done
more or less valuable work in several provinces.
The gang included James Campbell, ex-Post'
master-General, Victoria; W. M. K. Vale, for-
merly Victorian Commissioner of Customs; W.
H. Eitchett, parson and journalist, and soon to
be the Australian editor of that model of sanctified
pnggery, the Review op Reviews ; A. R. Eitchett,
now a Church of England parson in Maor-iland.
irom journalism, Jack Nicholson went on to the
magistracy, from which, if he does not jump to
the Residency of the N.T., he will vault into
something good.
What People Say.
“ Truth is stranger than Fiction,” so people say,
but such truth as we received from T. Channon,
Esq., photographer, Nowra, N.S.W., is only a
sample of what comes to hand by every mail from
all parts of Australia. Mr. Channon speaks for
himself : “I was one of the first attacked by La
Grippe at Nowra. The symptoms—sneezing,
running at nose, weak, watery eyes, frontal head-
ache, as if the brain wanted to press through, the
pain was almost constant, restless sleep, poor
appetite, constipation, foul tongue, constant ex-
pectoration of yellow, greenish phlegm, burning,
prickling feeling in the chest, great weakness and
pain at the nape of the neck, water —dark brown.
I tried to rise but was too weak, and had to lie
down again. Whilst at the worst, I read of the
curative properties of Clements Tonic, and was
induced to try it, although sceptical about
advertised remedies ; after a few doses I certainly
felt better, _so much that I wrote you, asking
advice, which you promptly afforded me. I
stated my case and you said it was a severe grip,
and recommended a continued course of Clements
Tonic. I followed your advice, and commenced
to mend rapidly and am now entirely recovered.
I only took four bottles, but am continuing it, so
as to thoroughly re-establish my strength (wise
man !) I can recommend it with the greatest
confidence for weak and delicate people.” Mrs.
Frances Rayner, Oxford Street, Paddington,
N.S.W., also writes, “I have suffered for many
years from dyspepsia and general debility, and
was induced to try Clements Tonic. I have
taken several bottles with such marked success,
that I have every confidence in recommending it
to my friends.” We must again warn the
suffering portion of humanity to be particularly
careful that the packages of Clements Tonic are
unbroken and intact. Several cases have come
under our notice where unscrupulous men have
interfered with the contents of the bottles, and
we now place a guarantee label over every
package, refuse all where this is broken. —F. M.
Clements, Melbourne and Sydney.

POLITICAL POINTS
see the pallid Prohibitionists, with Cheshire-cat
grins on their faces, rooting up all the vineyards.
The basis of all “ vested rights ” is law —
the breath of the legislators of the country. “ A
breath can unmake them as a breath has made.”
The operation of constitutional machinery is as
“sacred ” when it is negative and destructive as it
is when it is creative and positive. There is no
Tory argument that this bit of logic does not
riddle.
The Victorian Parliamentary Labour-
party at present consists of three members only
Hancock, Trenwith, and Dr. Maloney. The
Queensland Labour-party consists of about two
Glassey and Hoolan —but in both provinces there
will be big additions to the ranks at next election.
The Queensland Labour-party modestly calculates
on capturing nine additional seats.
H. H. Champion suggests a new kind, of
Parliamentary cloture for the Commons. Each
member’s share of the time there is minutes per
day ; he thinks therefore that it would be a fair
thing that any ordinary member who speaks for
say 40 minutes should be ‘shut up’ for a week
after so as to pull up his average. Every member
would require two slates then, one in the refresh-
ment-room, and the other at the Speaker’s desk.
President Harrison and Secretary Blaine
have, it is cabled, quarrelled over the Chilian
difficulty so seriously that Blaine now absents
himself from Cabinet meetings. The secret of
the quarrel between Blaine and Harrison is pos-
sibly the quarrel between their respective wives,
who have long been nagging at each other, and
whose latest casus belli is the hysterical support
given by Mrs. Blaine to Mrs. Maybrick’s petition,
which Mrs. Harrison violently opposes.
Reform of the House of Lords is audibly
talked about amongst members of the British
House of Commons. So far, the chief proposal
seems to be that Lords and Commons shall sit
and debate in the same chamber, but vote
separately, as in the old Soots Parliament. Lord
Rosebery proposes to enable any peer, who wishes
to do so, to sign a deed surrendering for ever his

South Australia emerges from the year
with two millions added to her private banking
deposits, and a decrease of two and a quarter
millions in banking advances.

hate in their hearts the Single-taxers.
It is asserted that a Bill providing Home
Rule for Scotland will be introduced in the British
House of Commons next session. The Scotch
members will vote for it almost as one man.
The W.A. Government has pledged itself
to introduce a Bill next session abolishing the
present qualification for members and extending
the franchise in the d irection of manhood suffrage.
In his official letter Premier Griffith dis-
approved of a session of the Federal Council this
year because it might be considered “ to indicate
a coolness with regard to the greater Federation
contemplated.”
Was it merely a coincidence that N.S.W.
Speaker Abbott stopped the speeches of Protec-
tionist members on the Customs Bill, and, with
the exception of John Haynes, allowed I reetraders
what time they pleased ?
At the annual N.S.W. Single-tax meeting
somebody said that the Maorilanders “were
fortunate in the possession of Sir George Grey and
his strong advocacy of the Single-tax. Who says
that Grey is a Single-taxer ?
Brisbane Courier, which persistently
advocated the formation of a coalition, now
clamours for a general election. This, too, after
deprecating a few months ago the ill-effects of a
dissolution during the present depression. The
new postal regulations have touched the COURIER
on the raw.
How long will it be before England follows
with respect to the Australian her own futile
experiment of 1778, when she sent a Commission
to the “rebellious” thirteen provinces of North
America offering to cede to them, totally and
radically, the legislative authority claimed by the
British Parliament ?
The “Yetus” letters, in the London
Times, exposing the rotten state of the British
army, are based on the report of the Parlia-
mentary Commission, headed by Hartington,
which report was squelched by the personal inter-
ference of the Queen, on behalf of her relatives,
Cambridge and Connaught.
The designation of Agent-General must be
changed for Minister, the office has so deve-
loped, since Victoria made the start, with Verdon,
who cadged the Nelson. Berry transformed him
self into a virtual Minister of the Crown, taking
important steps on his own responsibility, as in
regard to the New Hebrides.
The German Emperor's course will pro-
bably be exactly like that of Pins IX., who
began as an ardent Liberal, but became the most
violent of reactionaries, because, he said, the
masses were so ungrateful. Disraeli, at 70, wanted
to put the clock back 10 years, and he would
change the face of Europe. So with Bismarck.

hereditary legislative privileges, in order to make
himself eligible for a seat in the Commons.
The recent declaration of Andy Kelly,
M.L.A., that he was prepared to enter N.S.W.
Legislative Council in his shirt-sleeves, brings to
mind the historical assertion by the late 0. J.
Don, the Collingwood stone-mason, that when
elected to the Victorian Assembly he would take
the oath in his apron and working clothes; but
when Parliament met Don appeared in anew suit
of well-fitting black, black gloves, and a shiny
silk belltopper, much to the disgust of the
“ Platites.”
Labour-member Trenwith, of Vic., main-
tains that Protection makes commodities cheaper,
and yet gives the producer a higher price than
does Freetrado for what he produces. This is
done by wiping out the middlemen. The mer-
chants 'object to it, of course, because it takes
away their occupation, and brings producer and
consumer side by side. While Freetrade prevails
the merchant has a monopoly, because importing
requires a large capital, whereas every man can
start a small factory.
E. W. O’Sullivan boldly accused Sir Henry
Parkes in N.S.W. Assembly with wanting a pre-
cise knowledge of “everything outside British
political literature.” He need have made no
exception. Parkes has read with all the wide
desultoriness of a self-educated man, but also with
the self-edu. ated man’s absence of discrimination.
Consequently, his knowledge is confused, scrappy,
and ill-digested. People would be surprised if
they knew how large a proportion of his reading is
made up of works of the “Elegant Extract”
order.
When will the Australian democracies
learn that one of the essential principles of
democracy is simplicity of life? A fat salary
granted to any public official be ho Governor,
Judge, or that indispensable Judge’s associate, the
hangman—is a direct incentive to luxury, and
luxury is the child born of the liaison between
aristocracy and wealth. To attach “ allowances ”
to the emoluments of any post on the plea that
adequate representation of its duties demands
exceptional expenditure is to subsidise caste and
privilege.
H. H. Champion, in the Nineteenth
Century, says that the Labour Charter at next
general election will be—(l) Eight hours; (2)
Access to the land; (3) Abolition of the work-
house —pensions to be awarded in place of out-
door relief; (4) Graduated taxation of inherit-
ances and incomes ; and (5) Protective Legislation.
He thinks that a British Labour-Party in the
Commons could be made to go solid for the attain-
ment of its objects “with the most complete in-
difference to the convenience of Government or
Opposition.”
S.A. Audit Commissioners very briefly
show the difference between South Australian and
English finances :
The Imperial revenue is charged with the payment of
interest on the national debt, for which there are no re-
productive works worth mentioning, except the tele-
graphs, the profit on which is a very small item ; but the
debt here is also represented by railways, waterworks,
and other public works, which are worth more to the
colony than the total amount owing, and yield a net in-
come nearly sufficient to pay the whole of the interest.
This fairly states the case for Australia generally.
Rev. Cheong, Chinese preacher from Mel-
bourne, lectures throughout England against the
opium-trade. India gets nigh 10 millions sterling
a year out of opium-taxes, which it is considered
China pays, wherefore pious England forced
opium on China at the bayonet’s point and
cannon’s month. England went to war with
China, because Commissioner Lin, with Chinese
views of piety, destroyed two million sterling
value in opium, on English ships. But Chinky
Cheong must play light and show how not to do
it, because the Indian bishops are paid out of the
opium.
A meeting of Jackson’s Flat (Murrum-
bidgee) electors has decided to ask Arthur Rae,
M.P. (N.S.W.), to resign because he voted against
the Parliamentary vote of condolence to Queen
Victoria latelv passed. The Bulletin smiles.
The people who asked Rae to resign were not, you
may be sure, those who elected him. • Rae was not
the only member of Parliament who disbelieved
in the vote, but he was the only one who had the
grit to avow his opinions. Most of the rest stayed
away, and the balance weakly assented to a resolu -
tion against which, in a secret ballot, they would
have enthusiastically cast their votes,
Queen Victoria has been upon the British
throne 53 years, and during that period the nation
has paid lier (with compound interest) at the very
least 110 millions, while the sums paid to her off-
spring, pensioners, or other descendants, German
hr whatnot, must have run the amount up to
nearly double that figure. During the Queen’s
reign one billion pounds sterling has been directly
or indirectly filched from the British public in the
service of religion. Yet late calculations prove
that not one person in five in England ever goes
to a place of worship. In 1851, 37'3 per cent, of
the population attended a church of some sort;
1891 shows a decrease to 21 '3.
a O’Sullivan, during the fiscal debate in
N.S.W. Assembly, nailed Parkes’ monstrous lie
that the Protectionists of the United States were
the slave-holders, and that Protection was a
corollary of slave-ownership. J. C. Calhoun, the
very man singled out by Parkes for special men-
tion as a slave-holding Protectionist, speaking in
the Senate, in 1850, declared that “We (the
Southern States) must have free-trade, because
otherwise we derive no peculiar advantage from
the possession of ” —what do you think ?
“slaves!” The “ cheap nigger labour ” gave the
free-trader a supreme facility for getting into the
markets of the world. Freetrade—cheap 1 about)
everywhere.
Capital is further organising and console
dating in England. The British Shipowners’
Federation wants to ally itself with the
owners’ Association and the Manufacturers’
Union. With such a gigantic combination of
taskmasters, it is considered that the capitalists
would be able to pulverise the wage-earners and
defeat even a universal strike. So they might,
under ordinary conditions. But these two massed
foes confronting each other would present in
actual form the paradoxical problem of “an
irresistible force and an immovable body.” There
could be only one outcome to such a position, and
that —the physical outburst of the masses, a
revolution, in which organised capitaldom would
be broken up and swept away by a blood-red
blizzard. When both sides are fully organised the
whirlwind must come along.
The Australian daily papers {i.e., the
English papers locally established) gave, in a sub-
dued sort of way, their sweet approval to the
announcement that at Johnnesburg, South Africa,
an editor who had said some nasty things about
the recent Duke of Clarence had been mobbed
and ordered to quit the field. “ This incident,'
says the London press, “is an instance of the
universal loyalty of the British people ” (to mon-
archical institutions). Now, in this connection the
peculiar circumstances of the Transvaal must be
considered. The British there are under the
government of a race who whipped them at
Majuba Hill, and whom they hate; consequently,
the offence of the editor who threw bricks at
Clarence’s memory was construed by the local
Englanders (not Afrikanders-born, mind you, but
people imported as adults from England) as a
slap at their nation. And there you have it. In
Australia you can say exactly what you please
about the Duke of Clarence, or any other
potentate, and if one mob came to pull down your
office, another mob would roll up to “put a head’'
on them.
It is estimated that during the lO or
15 years the value of agricultural land in England
has fallen 50 per cent.; in some counties the fall
is put down as 81 per cent-
At Oobar (N.S.W.), according to the daily
papers, “ service cannot be held in the churches
owing to the smell caused by dead rabbits under
the flooring*” Dead dogmas, more likely.
A 2500-head mob of cattle arrived at
Muswebbrook (N.S.W.) on 20th January from
M‘Carthy’s station near Burketown, a distance of
2300 miles. Sixteen drovers were in_ charge, the
journey took nine months and only 25 head were
lost.
Phil. Mennell’s “Australasian Dictionary
of Biography” is announced for immediate pub-
lication, and will be looked for with interest
especially by those “eminent colonists” who,
being left out of its pages, consider they ought to
be in them.
Dear Bullet-in, — Apropos yonr paragraph
re Sudds and Thompson’s chains, can you inform
us where the chains which Schofield of the
“ Hopeful ” wore and died in at Brisbane gaol—
not half-a-century ago but only a couple .of years
since—are kept or can be seen? They would be a
truly interesting and valuable relic.—BjßjseANE.
7 We are requested to note that there was a
special service at Croajingolong Cathedral last
Sunday, in connection with the Duke of Clarence,
the sacred edifice being draped in black, and
fully 11 worshippers being present. The Reverend
Incumbent fairly broke down, and numerous
subscriptions were handed in for the new wattle-
and dab-manse.
Professor Mobins, of Berlin, says :
“Tolstoi has unwarrantably generalised a few
facts of his own selection. To put tobacco, opium ,
hasheesh and whisky in the same category is a
complete mistake. Tobacco should be classified
rather with tea and coffee, of which, strange to
say, Tolstoi has nothing to say. These luxuries
bring about, according to the condition of those
using them, a slight excitement or a quieting of
the nerves. They do not stupefy ; their use in-
volves no condition of their abuse. W hat T olstoi
says about the moral disadvantages,of smoking is
mostly without proof of any kind. His premise
that tobacco used in the (Customary mannei
stupefies, is simply false.”
One of the oldest hotel identities in -Sydney
is Mr. W. W. Aitken, manager of Aarons
Exchange Hotel Company, and more familiarly
known to fame as “ Old Bill.” He has been con-
nected with the hotel for 20 years, serving first
under Mr. W. Cannon, now of Betty s; then
under Mr. L. Aarons, who, after some years of
unprecedented success, floated the concern into a
limited liability company, of which “Old Bill ” is
now manager. For at least two decad es the Exchange
Hotel has been in the front rank of city caravan-
serais, importing its own wines, spirits, &c.,
direct from Europe, and conducting its business
on a scale which defies competition. It is as
impossible to go there without meeting Bill as it
is to find Playfair without a cigar, or Jimmy
Mirams minus his umbrella. If one is to judge
by this company’s dividends, the management
can give all modern palaces a long start, and
overtake them without turning a hair.
THE CRAFT OF THE CRAFTY.
“Pa, what is the Agent-Generalship?
Does it sail the summer sea?
Does it e’er come south of the line for a trip?
Oh, tell me what it may be.”
“The Agent-Generalship, my son, is a shabbily-gilded boat
Whither Premiers flee when their day is done,
And their banks have blistered everyone—
To the Agent-Generalship they run
To keep themselves afloat.”

The history of Australia for use in the public, schools of New South "Wales it in

fully going through the work, and has already concluded that there are matters in it,
especially relating to the early history of the colony, and about which there will
probably always be a diversity of opinion, which should be eliminated.

Two absolute essentials for the existence
of the human race are—land and air. Many
economic and political systems have been invented
and are advocated for obtaining land for each
individual to live upon, but it has been left to the
Hydraulic Cooling and Ventilating Co. to intro-
duce pure air into every habitation in Australia,
by means of their “Perfection” Cooler and
Ventilator. By attaching this machine to your
water supply or tank, and simply turning on the
tap, a constant stream of pure, fresh air can be
obtained in any chamber you desire. Punkahs
are thus superseded, perishable goods can be kept
at a small expense without ice, and you can enjoy
the luxury of a cool chamber on the hottest day or
night. The machine, which is simplicity itself,
works at the cost of one half-penny per day, while
the price brings it within the reach of most.
Rend for particulars or inspect the machines work-
ing in our offices. T. A. Knight and Co., St.
James Chambers, King-street, Sydney.

That jolly old missionary, Rev. Lorimer
Fison, relates how, on one of the South Sea
Islands, a wooden-legged man who had long and
vainly looked for a wife among the limited white
population at last concluded to marry a local nig.
who gave her consent. When the pair appeared
before the good pastor to be “spliced ” the man,
in reply to the usual question, said he “would,”
but the bride-elect, when asked if she would take
this man for her wedded husband, plumply said
“No!” “What do yon mean?” said the mis-
sionary. “All,” replied the recalcitrant bride,
“I have had a long talk with my people this
morning, and they told me I would be a fool to
marry a fellow with only one leg.” Hereupon the
bridegroom, seeing that the case was hopeless,
started to stump off—“ Pooh !” said he, contemp-
tuously to his lady-love, “If it’s only legs you
want, why the devil don’t you go and marry a
centipede ?”

A little Melbourne paper was amusing
itself a few weeks since by heaping scorn and
ridicule upon the cocked hat of a harmless consul
who represented in Victoria a republic consisting
of three men and a dog. Soon after this the poor,
vain consul died, whereupon remorse laid hold of
the little paper, which is a good deal like the
departed consul in its nature, and it rose upon a
pair of short hind legs to observe that the departed
object of its contempt was a good, kind man and
gave pleasure to all. Nil nisi honum is a healthy
rule if you upend it: Never say anything of a
dead man which would not be true and un-
nauseous if he were alive and kicking.
* * *
The expensive marble tablets bearing the
names of all the Sydney Mayors, and intended for
the local Centennial Hall, have been cast aside,
because the name of one ex-Mayor as inscribed on
his tablet is short of an initial !
* * •*
One hundred and twenty minute-guns
were fired in Sydney at the time of the funeral of
the Duke of Clarence. Take the cost of each dis-
charge, multiply it by at least 60 (GO guns were
fired at each British naval-station around the
world), multiply that by the number of naval-
stations, add a lot of other sixties for the exuber-
ance of British official colonial loyalty, and
explain what good this expenditure does either to
the living (who, as a London cable tells us, are
begging for charity owing to the want of employ-
ment caused by Court-monrning) or to the dead
Duke of Clarence, who, according to the Estab-
lished Church, is now either in Heaven or Hell?
But we forgot; every Established Church sends
every prince to Heaven.
# * #
The wedding-presents sent to the late
Duke of Clarence and his bride-elect are being
returned. The proposal to convert them into a
dowry for the penniless Princess shows how vul-
garly and brutally unsentimental a lot of people
are. To turn wedding-presents to so practical a
use would be like basing a wedding-breakfast upon
funeral baked meats, or making a wedding-ring of
gold filched by an undertaker from the teeth of
the dead.

The death of poor Prince Albert Victor
should prove a perfect god-send to Government
House, Tasmania, where, as the Viceregal Court
will have to go into mourning for some weeks,
the expenditure on sardine-sandwiches and rasp-
berries and milk for distinguished visitors will be
temporarily knocked on the head.
# # #
In the proclamation issued by the N.S.W.
Government announcing the Duke of Clarence’s
death he was referred to as the eldest son of the
Prince of Wales. At this rate “Wales” must
have at least two sons left. Who knows?

The Privy Council, as appears com the
full report of the case just received, quashed the
conviction in the N.S.W. (bigamy) case of Rev.
McLeod, with small ceremony. They didn’t
worry a fraction over the point that the local
Courts wrestled with, but just decided that the
section giving the N.S.W. Courts jurisdiction in
bigamy tvheresoever the second marriage took
place, was ultra vires if it meant what it said.
They thought, however, that it meant only
“ wheresoever within the local jurisdiction,” and
therefore was not u’tra vires, but was not nearly
wide enough to cover Dr. McLeod. It may be
remarked, however, that the text of the judgment
incidentally shows how deep and expansive is
Privy Council ignorance of Australian circum-
stances.

An elaborate swell who lives in Vicfcoria-
street, Darlinghurst, Sydney, returned ho ne after
spending a Ray evening. As he was fumbling
about to find the latch-key slot lie, with his left
hand, got hold of somebody’s beard. He instantly
concluded it to be that of a burglar, and a
desperate struggle ensued. The billy-goat came
out on top, as the swell was “a hit rocky on his
pins. ’ That goat is an evil and a desperate
character well-known to the police, and a warrant
will be issued for it as soon as the disabled potent-
ate gets well enough to swear an information.
The one Australian family, other than that
of Governor King, identified for three generations
with the Royal Navy, is that of Pasco. The ori-

falgar, and, gaining post rank, was captain of the
Hindostan, which brought out Governor Macquarie

at the Australasian Science Association at Hobart
last week, was witli Fitzroy, Stoke*, and Darwin

son is navigating-lieutenant on the Palumah,
Queensland surveying vessel. Pasco (the original)
was, on half-pay, commander of the Victory at
Portsmouth, and during the later years of his life
used to have his dinner served while he sat in
Nelson’s chair.

Few people are aware, though many sus-
pected it at the time, that the late William
Macleay inspired that skit in Bell’s Like in
Sydney called the “Royal Ball.” It had refer-
ence to the ball which the ladies of Sydney
proposed to get up in honour of the Duke of
Edinburgh. It was he who invented all the
names of the ladies concerned, and he was par-
ticularly happy in some of them, such as Mrs.
Hideous Crimson, and Mrs. Saccharine Hitts.
Of course, everybody knows, or ought to know,
that Grosvenor Bnnster (or was it George
Morton ?) fired the bullets, but Macleay certainly
made them. Poor Tom Garrett was a kind of
editor of old Bell (now merged in the Sydney
Mail), and he was horsewhipped on account of
the article by one of Deas-Thomson’s sons,

The Comores princes, exiles at present in
Noumea, went to a ball. A very pretty society

the ninety-ninth ?” Tableau.

A genuine bit of tragedy was that which
happened in an across-sea province at “Cup”
time last year. One of the better stamp of
“ bookies ” was engaged to a young girl, and the
marriage was fixed for a fortnight after Cup-day,
providing he wasn’t “hit too heavy.” After the
ceremony, it was arranged they should go “home”
for a trip. Derby-day saw him a moderate loser,
but, to tease her, he exaggerated his losses in the
cable message to his sweetheart. She was sicken-
ing with influenza at the time, and the news so
affected her that she became alarmingly ill. W hen
his wire on the night of the Cup reached her
home, giving the aggregate of his winnings, and
stating that he had “booked a double berth ” on
an early Orient-liner for England, she was coma-
tose. Her lover landed in tune for her funeral.
Five years hence or thereabouts it will
dawn upon the lots of people who were interested
as depositors in certain Australian building and
investment societies that in becoming share-
holders in the reconstructed organisations they
played a beautiful game—for the original share-
holders. Before the reconstructions the depositors,
having first call on the assets, were in the posi-
tion of mortgagees in possession, and masters of
the situation. Now they rank with the mort-
gagors, and it will take another boom of tenfold
magnitude to the last to place them in as good a
position as they were before the panic. And the
era of booms has gone by in Australia.

tally, Hadspen, Tasmania, M.A. Trinity College,
Oxford, M.P. for Westbnry, and Speaker of the
House of Assembly, Tasmania, b. 24th September,
1821,” informs Burke that “ the original spelling

Further he informs that ingenious per verier of

A SUMMERY SONG.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
’Tis beastly hot,
Yes, very warm ;
I tell you what—
We want a storm
To brew and break
And cool the air ;
All night awake
I groan and swear.
When daylight steals
Across the sky
A fellow feels
Both damp and dry.
He’d fain expire,
And straightway go
To try the fire
That burns below.
Ah ! me, Ah ! me,
Twere truly nice
To simply be
A slab of ice.
Yet, by the bye,
I’d rather wish
To live and die
A frozen fish.
No appe-tite !
What can one eat ?
I loathe the sight
Of butcher’s meat,
And send away
The baker blue
With “Not to-day,
We're baking, too.”
My turtle dove
I can’t adore,
For making love
Is now a bore;
Though when last night
Her leave she took
I gave her quite
A melting look.
Excuse this rot,
I humbly plead:
The weather’s hot,
It is indeed:
Restrain your scorn,
And curb your wrath—
My muse has gone
To get a bath.
“NEC TECUM NEC SINE TE RIVERE POSSUM!"
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“ Quit my sight!” I exclaimed in my anger; “ begone !
Thou fury incarnate in womanly form !
I had rather through ages of loneness drift on
Than combat again thy fierce seasons of storm.
Thou hast made of my life such a hell upon earth
That no moments of bliss absolution can give ;
Take my gold, thou art welcome to all I am worth,
But go, for no longer with thee can I live !
“O return to me, darling !” regretful I cried,
“All the wrongs of the past are forgotten ; return
To thy place in my heart, in my arms, by my side ;
For thy presence, beloved, I unceasingly yearn.
And if passion betray thee to wrathful excess
1 will own I’m in fault and will freely forgive ;
Thou shalt conquer again with one tender caress—
Come back, for without thee no more can I live !
“ I banish thee now, but next moment deplore thee,
I fly thee to-day and to-morrow I seek ;
I am firm, but thy syren-like spell is cast o’er me,
Thou hast but to plead and 1 know myself weak.
So vanquished 1 yield to thy fell fascination,
I cannot escape, though in frenzy 1 try ;
It is madness to strive ’gainst embodied temptation—
I cannot live with thee — without thee, 1 die !”

“The Kidnapped Squatter, and Other
Australian Tales,” by Andrew Robertson, is
admirably produced by Longmans, Green and
Co., London. The stories themselves are not
specially well-written, and are rather good material
for literary treatment than worthy specimens of
Australian literature. The tales are four in
number, and one, “Jack Reeveley,” is very good,
although a trifle improbable. “ A Bush Adven-
ture ” contains excellent raw matter for working
up by a practised litterateur.
“King Bungaree’s Pyalla ” and other
stories “illustrative of manners and customs that
prevailed among Australian aborigines,” by Mary
A. Fitzgerald-author of “Australian Furs and
Feathers is published by Edwards, Dunlop &
Co., Limited, Sydney, Brisbane, and London,
and is a capital collection of child’s stories, very
flimsily bound, and altogether inadequately illus-
trated. A book of this kind, if worth doing at
all, is worth doing well. The little volume
smacks of the soil, and the author is to be compli-
mented for opening up a hitherto unworked field
in Australian child literature.
In “A Poppy’s Tears”—Chapman and
Hall, London —that well-known story-teller, Man-
nington Caffyn, describes in exceeding good
English the horrors of opium-eating, or, what
amounts to the same thing, morphia-injecting.
The novel is interesting and highly dramatic, but
we are nevertheless at a loss to know what Mr.
Caffyn is driving at. He rails at his hero for
succumbing to what he calls a vice, but he proves
at the same time that his hero couldn’t help him-
self. Inherited tendency, &0., proved too strong
for him and he knuckled under. The good man
of the plot gets a lot of undeserved praise for
being what his parents made him, and altogether
the philosophy of the story is mixed—very.
Apart from the scientific aspect, the novel is well
worth reading, and shows that the author can
deal with the complicated interests of a long story
with considerable skill and much literary power.

Melbourne Students’ Art Gallery is not a
nlace where you can spend more than a week
with much pleasure. Perhaps the students aie
somewhat hampered by want of models. The ones
they ha ve are principally four—a Mun ay cod, a lady,
a porter-bottle, and an old man. The cod they have
painted in a variety of attitudes, but always with
his head due nor’ nor’ east when the artist was to
the sou’ sou’ west. They painted him as long as
he kept anything like fresh. The man, too, has
undergone severe trials on canvas, and has had
to submit to a clean shave and other disguises.
To paint the lady’s portrait seems to be the first
effort of every student, and the result is exhibited,
all round the room. She is in various styles and
decrees of dress, and contrasting her differing
portraits a wild curiosity to know what in
Collins ■ street she is like leaves the critic
displeased and unsatisfied. Just as Melbournians
are as they wonder what on earth a syren really
resembles. The Waterhouse specimen has the
head of a private-bar maid adorned with the flying
hack-hair of a female-bounder, welded on to the
bodv of a mopoke. Ulysses must have been a
prize Johnnie if they had to tie him to the mast
for fear of his eloping with such a crowd as they
are represented. In fact, you can’t imagine any-
one desyren them. But the representation is pro-
bably as much like the common or garden syren of
Ulysses’ time as the steam syren whistle is like the
syren song. From the perturbation of U lysses
and his probably bald-headed crew we imagine
that those syrens were in very private-bars, and
perhaps some of them were not very much better
than they ought to have been, and would have
been if the Evangelical Grubb had been along a
few thousand years sooner.

Sydney is infested with a class of men who
might be termed “ warehouse-buttoners,” only
they are better known as brokers and commission-
agents. These gentlemen haunt the leading hotels
on the look-out for country storekeepers, whom
they show round the “ trade,” get a good commis-
sion from the warehouse men for what the store-
keeper buys, and then very often assist the store-
keeper to knock down a big cheque. In Man-
chester they are known as “ hookers,” but in Man-
chester they often make several hundred pounds
a slap, which is never done in Sydney. Between
the buttoners there is no love lost. One of these
gentlemen picked up a storekeeper and proceeded
to show him round. Showing round means alter-
nately visiting a pub. and a warehouse. At a
private-bar the storekeeper met a buttoner who
had shown him round upon a previous occasion,
and called upon him to drink with them. “ Not
if I know it,’’ said the first buttoner. “You
won’t drink with that man in my company.
“ At least,” said the second, “ you will permit me
to speak a few words with Mr. Dash apart !
“Isit on business ? ” “Yes.” “ Then you can go
to Tartarus and wait until I have done with
him.”

“ Charlie” Barclay, managing director of
the Commercial Bank of Tasmania —who has lain
low for the occasion—has just fired off red-hot
shot in reply to the bombardment of abuse
levelled at him in connection with the closing of
the Y.D.L. Bank. He now makes it pretty clear
that the only enemies of the “ old bank ” were its
managers. Speaking at the half-yearly meeting
of his bank, held recently, he said : “Five days
before the (V.D.L.) Bank closed we lent them
U 20,000. .... I have now no hesitation in
saying that this amount was obtained by falsehood
and misrepresentation.” He further said that
the V.D.L. Bank “ was ruined by gross incom-
petency, reckless mismanagement, and negligence
which appears to me to be criminal.” Will this
well-aimed shot bring about a searching enquiry ?

The Commercial Bank of Tasmania', which

The banking premises in Macquarie-street, Hobart,

ments, and the institution which began its career
in 1829 in a little shop in Elizabeth-street, under
the sole proprietorship of old John Dunn, whose
fortune was made at shopkeeping, will soon have
to find a larger building.

Apropos of the big hold which brothers
“Charlie” and “Dave” Barclay have upon the

Twelve months ago the son of a wealthy
citizen of Sydney refused a gift from his father of
several thousand pounds, “to set him up in the
world.” He was the only son, and did not see
what was to prevent him getting all if he stayed
with the old man. To-day his father is married
to a girl of 26, and, after making a very good
settlement on his wife, has lost all his remaining
money. The son is eking out a small living as
agent for something or other, and the father has

Laughing, flirting, beaming on,
Your new cavalier:
While he waits your whims upon—
Anxious, fond, sincere—
Has your memory no space
For the hours we spent
Sitting in that very place
Last month, Millicent?
I was then your devotee,
It was then your whim
To bestow those smiles on me
Now reserved for him :
With the favours you vouchsafe
He should be content;
For to him you give all you gave
To me, Millicent.
Just a tenancy at will
Of your changeful heart,
Glances bent with all the skill
Of the wanton’s art:
Just the right of flattery,
Of vow and compliment—
Right which you extended me
Last month, Millicent.
Soon he’ll learn that all your arts,
Are but trained to make
Harvest of devoted hearts
Now for triumph’s'sake:
Bitter thoughts will throng his mind
When he sees your bent,
He will think all womankind
Wanton, Millicent.
Vale! Without long regret,
Part we, Millicent!
I have learned your falsehood, yet
I am well content:
Scorned am I, yet scornful now
I proud lip can curl:
You’ve secured another beau
And I—another girl.

It’s awful when the p’leeoe has got a derry on a chap.”
I sigh’d and shed a tearlet for that noble nature marred,
But ah ! the Bench was rough on him, and gave him six
months’ hard.
He only said, “ Beyond the grave you’ll cop it hot, by
Jove 1
There ain’t no angel p’leece to get a derry on a cove.”

CORRESPONDNECE
‘S,E.B. ’ : Your ‘ Fare well ’ is an atrocious
sample of metrical grovel. What do you take The
Bulletin for ?....* Pro Bono ’ (W.C.0.): Sorry we have
nothing which judging from your contributions, would
suit you. ‘ John Dodd ’ : Nobody outside the Masonic
body can say how many Freemasons are employed in the
Civil Service.... ‘ Jim B.’: We read hundreds of letters
every week, and have no time to wade through long-
drawn-out maundenngs. If you have a question to put,
put it in 30 words and we’ll answer it.. . ‘C.J. H.’: Letter
posted to you at Wilcannia.... ‘ H.O.H.’: Very likely
indeed. Lots of horses are scratched because sweep
ticket-holders will not lay them a big percentage on their
money with the owners. Probably the consultation man
divulged the name of the holder ; that is often done.,..
‘E.E.’: Any man may set up a carriage and go round
doctoring, without any qualification, but he mustn’t
•style himself doctor. Here the Law has an advantage
over Physic, in more rigid fencing round ‘F.G.R.’:
You ‘ make your debut in journalism ’ is an adaptation of
an ancient wheeze wherein old father Abraham probably
debuted.... ‘ Acunthla ’ (Melb.): Asa rule parodies are
odious. Your parody is particularly odious because it is
so close. But, tell us, is the ‘ B flat Trombone ’ original?
... ‘Henry M.’(Tas.): Have not got the pamphlet ...
‘ Lauraville ’: Thanks.... ‘ Justice ’ (Tentertteld): ‘Re-
form's’ statement is still true of some places. Shall be
glad to read your ‘copy’—if written in ink . .‘Te
Rawin’: Thanks.... ‘M. L. Newmarket ; Thanks
‘The Patriot ’: Good and true, but Manning’s career and
the lessons of his life are pretty well known by heart. To
recapitulate would be to platitudinise...‘G. H. Mitchell’:
“The Laughing Jackass,”decidedly good verse. Will try
and use.... “John Arum ” : “ The City of the Future ”is
very fine, classical verse, but as long as it is fine—in fact,
much too long to make use of ‘John Williams’:
Idea good, but unsuitable to our columns ... ‘T. Free-
man : One-man-one-vote should apply in its integrity to
every man not incapacitated for the use of the franchise
either by lunacy or serving a term of imprisonment for
proved crime. You cannot make disqualification retro-
spective. When a man has served a sentence he should
resume his pditical along with his civil rights
‘Echo’: ‘The Great Communist’ is right enough as
far as sentiment goes, but you must discover a super-
lative method of treating such a hackneyed theme if you
want anybody to read it ‘F. W. Kennwell’: You
say that you would you were ‘ back in mountains,
climbing o'er their caverns deep, where the dingo's how l
is sacred, and the ’possum wakes from sleep.’ We would
you were I .... ‘ Quirk’ ; The whole of your poem on the
Cmrajong tree is too huge a contract to print; but here
is a choice sample -Look well at it!
Its manly form’s allowed to stand
From the ringbark scourge it’s free
A pride and b auty to our fair land
Australia's currajong tree.
. ~,‘A.C.’: In W.A. no mining leases, &c., are now
issued to Asiatics.. . ,‘A.N.M.’: It is worth as much as
you can get, and might be worth advertising. But in
selling to a really good buyer, who w ill pay a fair price,
you will have to give statement of title .. ‘Poverty’:
Thanks ... ‘A. 0.0.’: The explanation of ‘ our contem-
poraries” dislike to the ‘ personalities ’ of The Bulletin
is mainly to be found in the circumstance that The
Bulletin publishes the personalities a few weeks in
advance of themselves .. ‘T.B.S.’ (Goulbimi); A loses.
London is not larger than any other two cities in the
world ‘Nil Never-Never’ (Orange): Not absolutely
bad, but the swagsman gels wearisome as a subject for
poetry. Life is not all swag ‘Robin Hood’: We
respect your filial sentiment, but a loving sou is not
necessarily a good poet. ~‘G. Bennet’ (Queensland):
We are going to wash your poem. If we can get some of
the profanity out of it we will publish it.... ‘ T.F.’ (Surry
Hilts): We read your ‘Wanted, a Boy’s Suit,’and then
fell down insensible. An epic like yours should be broken
to us gently, as we are in delicate health... ‘A. Hass’:
The painful st-ory of your meeting with a horse upon the
sands needs further consideration ‘R.A.T.’: We don’t
personally ‘ object ’ to the Duke of Clarence, so your
question is based on a total misconception. We haven’t
time to ‘ object ’ to dukes so long as they leave us alone.
Pro\ ided a duke keeps out of sight, or is under chloro-
form, and isn’t an active nuisance, we don’t
object to him more than to anybody else
‘Cosmos’: How would this read?—The probability is
that although Mr. Scott belongs to such and such a reli-
gion, he is at bottom a decent, honest man, and as
bigoted in his way as Habakkuk Mucklewrath ‘J. F.
Sherry’: Declined.... ‘ A.R.P.’: We read far better
stories every day in the police-column of the daily papers.
..‘A.A.’: Why should not the Minister release on
license the rest of the Mount Rennie prisoners?....
‘ A.C.’(Morpeth): Thanks ‘Chromos’: Amusing, no
doubt, but you haven’t set down the fun on paper. ..
‘On the Wallaby ’: Can’t read your alleged writing.
Your caligraphy is the only one which has fairly beaten
us these five years.... ‘ R.M.’ (Thargomindah); Story
received with thanks ...‘Jim Byrnes': You couldn’t
have made your statements clearer if you had buried
them in a barrel of tar and dropped it in a coal-mine.
What is the connection between the girl in boy’s clothes
and the nephew of James Quinn, anyhow?....‘ U.R.’ (The
Palmer): "* Boozer’s Lament ’is just bad enough to escape
being printed. Not much scope for that sort of verse;
our own office-drunk does most of our beer poetry
•t Justice’ (Howlong): The average ‘beak’always splits
the difference that way; he does it for no particular
reason, except to show that his judicial eye sees through
both parties.... ‘S. J.’: Why not write legibly ?.... * Sarah
Island’: We know of no other book, on the subject....
‘ Demo ’: There are great solid masses of truth in it, but
the jingle is gone in both feet. Will look up the other
subject ‘Stuart G. Mitchell’: Thanks; will probably
publish ‘Bona-fide’; Will publish next week most
likely... ‘James S.S.’: Held for consideration ‘Sir
Henry ’ (Mudgee): Thanks; will use ‘Concord’: Will
read ‘Cut Out.'... ‘C.O.C.’: The man who likes to take
oath that his fiction is ‘ founded on facts ’ is a prosaic
being. One fact, and that of the flimsiest, is enough for
a column story. You can get a good column story, if you
are clever enough, out of every back-yard goat who
gnaws a kerosene-tin, and out of every banana-skin in the
gutter. [Many replies held over.]
London Graphic praises Historian Lecky’s
poems and awards him a place “among our most
esteemed singers.” The world, on reading the
ineffable commonplaces put forward in justifica-
tion of this praise, will cordially damn the
Graphic as a literary critic.
Cumberland Argus : “ This week we were
shown a magnificent sample of cherries,” &c.
Shown? Wooh !
Spagnoletti: “ The Benvenue Captain,
going down with the pipe in his mouth, reminds
me of the coolest bushman I ever saw. He was
flung from his horse in Bourke-street, Melbourne,
but his pipe never left his jaws until he was in the
saddle again.”
Paterfamilias Cragg, head of the great
team of acrobats now in Australia, is 46
years old, and has been an acrobatic per-
former since the age of 15. He has been
married three times, and has earned quite a
fortune. The ears of the veteran acrobat who
does not wear a skull-cap for protection in
shoulder-somersaults, are often hacked and lumpy,
like those of a prize bull-pup. No two men turn
somersaults alike, and the acrobat who has
partnered many tumblers is likely to secure a
memento of each on his down-trodden head and
rasped ears. Cragg, senior, has no such scars,
and the reason is that he has trained all his chil-
dren from infancy ; consequently, filial piety—or
acrobatic perfection—restrains them from damag-
ing the bead of the family. Father Cragg has
been a good boxer in his day (which from his
healthy appearance might be now), and for some-
time he held the amateur championship of Man-
chester, England. He tells an interesting story
of the Dempsey-Fitzsirnmons’ fight. Cragg was
performing at a theatre in New Orleans when the
news of Fitzsimmons’ victory came per telegram.
He was asked by the manager to break the
news to the audience. The audience was simply
struck dumb, and to fistic America, which had
backed him to a man, the snufting-out of the
Nonpareil was a phenomenon as bewildering as
the eclipse of the sun was to the ancients. Cragg
holds a high opinion of Mr. Paddy Slavic. Black
Jackson, he affirms, breaks out on such howling
jamborees at intervals, that his days as a fighter
are numbex-ed. “The Graggs in dress-clothes”
first appeared on the play-bills some nine years
ago, when the family took the lead at an Ameri-
can theatre. All rival acrobats immediately
followed suit, with a view of “trading on their
cloth,” but failed to score points by doing so.
None of the professionals seem to i rain on
orthodox lines. The Graggs always drink and
smoke just as much as the ordinary athlete does
out of training, but they are particular in taking
all precautions against catching cold. Cragg says
he has never seen a man killed or badly injured in
acrobatic feats. The first accident to his family
happened lately at the Royal, Sydney, when his
eldest son strained a foot-tendon ; this, however,
does not debar him from going through his usual
programme. None of the papers have mentioned
that one of the Graggs is a daughter—Victoria—
born in Sandhurst, Vic., 13 years ago. She is a
wonderful acrobat —especially for a girl. Her
father says that it is impossible to train a girl to
the pitch of perfection obtainable in a boy.
Although the audience may not detect it, yet a
girl tumbler is clumsier, less springy, and far
heavier than a boy. A girl doesn’t tumble to it
like a boy, you see. The fact is that the parent
heart of Father Cragg is locked up in “ dat boy,”
Arthur. The ten-year-old prodigy is barely four
feet high, and 351b. in weight. He has been
schooled in tricks since the age of seven months.
He was 18 months old when he made his first
public appearance, and the audience laughed so
that he was seized with stage fright, ran off, and the
largest lolly obtainable wouldn’t beguile him into
facing the music again. Arthur’s vice is cutlets
or grilled chops. He likes just three for break-
fast. Soon after the war the Graggs visited
Egypt, but only to sink 9000 francs in four weeks,
and to land in Dunkirk, France, with hardly a
coin in their pocket on Christmas day. One
special feature of the Graggs’entertainment is that
when lyjng on their backs doing foot-work they
use no shoulder nor loin supports. The Graggs
have been unto the uttermost ends of the earth
which yield pay-dirt. When Cragg, sen., visits
the North Pole, and poises himself with his back
upon it, his boy prodigy will steady himself upon
his father’s Heaven-seeking sole, start forth like
a boomerang towards the Polar Star, and come
back doing “ flip-flaps ” over the Aurora Borealis.
When the eyes become weak or the lids in-
flamed and sore, a scrofulous condition of the
blood is indicated. For scrofula, in all its forms,
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla is the best remedy. It vitalizes
the blood and expels all humors.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
A Queensland writer tells how Lady Norman
. j y u . blue ribbon round the neck of the winner of the
o.ieensland Derby, the other day, and takes a good deal
nf the glamour off the story. First she hitched on the
ornament and then she endeavoured to make an oration.
‘This’ she said, enthusiastically, ‘ is the Derby ribbon.’
• Yes ’ mum,’ said the owner joyously. ‘ It is, y’r lady-
,-n ’ sa id the trainer. The jockey gaped and feebly
rptnarked, ‘Oh!’ ‘This is the ribbon that—ah—goes
dth ihe Derby,’ said Lady Norman, starting afresh, not
nnite so enthusiastically.' ‘No doubt of it,’ said the
trainer ‘ It are, mum,’ added the owner. ‘ It am,’ said
the iockey. ‘ You have—aw—won the Derby,’ pursued
her Excellency hopelessly. ‘ We have, mum,’ said the
owner joyously. ‘ Bar protests, of course,’ said the
trainer. ‘ It’s too late for protests,* said the jockey re-
oMiirin'gly; ‘it’s all right.’ ‘You have come in in front
nf the others, you know,’ the Governor’s wife floundered
on in utter despair. ‘ We DID,’ said the owner, in wild
enthusiasm, ‘thanks to you, mum.’ ‘By a good ’arf
length,’ said the jockey. ‘Therefore he ,’’ went on
her Excellency. ‘Beggin’ y’r pardon, mum, said the
iockey ‘ it’s a Ally, y’r know.’ ‘ Therefore he,’ said her
ladyship frantically, ‘I mean she-that is, of course—
ah/m—therefore I—of course I congratulate you, don t
you see, and—and—ahem—that’s all.’ (Tremendous
ipplause.) # # #
Little wonder that the world at large is apt to
mok upon the average Australian sporting writer as only
a shade above a jockey or trainer. The gross illiteracy of
manv of these gentry is pitiable, and is a standing testi-
monial to the ignorance of the people who own the
snorting papers (Australasian excepted). Hardly one of
them for instance, seems to know the difference between
‘‘lav'” and “lie.” “The course lays near So-and-So
“the race lays between Take-’em-down and Hardpull,”
are sentences you read every day in one or other of the
papers. # # #
Jt was at a suburban pony meeting recently
that the “push” had a real good thing and backed it
heavily but it did not come off, as their pony was beaten
bv a short head. After the race the following conversa-
tion took place between trainer and jockey. T.: “ Never
saw you ride a worse race.” J.How’s that? I couldn’t
keep him further hack without pulling his head off and
running the risk of us all being sent up.” T. : “ What

For ways that are dark and for tricks that are

won in the 14.1 class. When a wager was laid that the

Why touching the moke up after the most approved
methods with a hot iron—and so on. Every winner

The San Francisco Examiner reports that
Johnel Sullivan has “come back from Australia with
wrath and side whiskers.” Then it interviewed him:—
“The Australians,” said Sullivan, “are the and
John launched forth into a string of condemnatory vitu-
perativeness that would have knocked any less remote
island off the face of creation as he spoke. “You may
print all that and say I said it,” he concluded, “ for of
all the loafers on this earth the Australians take the bun.”
Nothing could be plainer, nothing more palpable, than
the fact that the world’s greatest slogger felt overcrowded
and out of place on this earth as long as Australia existed.
His great hand sank with a Aop on the marble desk as he
accentuated his remarks with a thump that made the
building quiver. At the mention of the antipodean con-
tinent one could almost see the nap of the champion’s
silk hat stand up and bristle with indignation. “They
set about boycotting me before I reached there,” he ex-
plained. “The papers began it, and the people took it
up.” Here follows a violent diatribe on the way the show
was managed. John L. was so patently glad to be back
in America again—to be anywhere on this green earth,
■or out of it, away from Australia, that it was
obviously superAuous to ask him how he liked
ooming back. Nevertheless he spontaneously volunteered
the information that he was glad, profanely glad, to be
back in the States again, and feel beneath his solid feet
the free soil of America. He pensively twirled his cigar
in his mouth as he spoke, and again consigned Australia
to eternal torment, and characterised its inhabitants as a
“ set of bums.” In fact, every invective known to
the American and Bostonian vocabularies John L. Sullivan
hurled against the absent continent, its population, its
theatrical methods, and everything pertaining thereto.
He had no use for any of them, and made no secret of
that circumstance. In his own words, the mere thought
of the place made him tired. He was cold sober when he
spoke. He had taken but one drink, in fact, since he left
the antipodes, and that was on his own birthday, which
was an occasion celebrated with great solemnity on the
steamship Alameda.

TheN.S.W. Cavalry tournament, at Rosehill,
last week was a tremendous affair. All sorts of events
were going on at once all over the place. While some
excited parties were wrestling on horseback in front of
the grandstand, a jumping competition would be in full
swing behind them, and away to the right a line of lancers
would be tent-pegging ; in the middle distance a sweating
mob of artillerymen would be dismounting their guns
against time, and on the distant horizon Aights of blue-
jackets mounted on bare-backed troop-horses could be
seen charging wildly in every direction, hogging their
horses and hauling frantically at their “ rudderlines "
without the slightest effect. And yet even with all these
diversions people got very weary of the show. One tent-
Ser is much like another; lemon-cutting and Turks-
slashing pall upon the jaded taste; and the only
really “fetching” events in the affair were the blue-
jackets’ race and the wrestling on horseback. The blue-
jackets numbered 80, and from their style of riding it is
about a fair estimate to suppose that 25 of them had never
seen a horse before. They were hoisted up on their
steeds, got a good grip of the mane with one hand and
instantly began to flog with the other. They were dog-
ging before they started, and the horses were rushing
about wildly, each thinking (and with very good
grounds, too) that the devil was on his back.
How they ever got into line for a start was a
miracle, but the starter had the bugle signal for “halt”
Bounded, and the troop horses immediately propped dead,
in most cases shooting their riders out on to their ears.
As soon as they had scrambled back, the order “ charge ”
was given, and every horse set off as hard as he could
hok. It was God’s mercy that none of the bluejackets in
the front of the race fell off, as, with about twenty-Ave
horses behind them, they would have been trampled to
mummies. Only one horse ffnished riderless, but some of
the old nags, as soon as they passed the post, slewed sharp
off for the gate, and shot their riders yards in the air. A
lot more went round the course again and rode a second
nmsh. The leader, who was hanging on by teeth and
nails, raised his head and cheered as they passed the
stand. His horse immediately charged in among a troop of
lancers who were performing evolutions, and we saw the
chest of his pants flash in the sunlight as he went down
nows first right among the astonished lancers. No one
was hurt. Gov. Jersey was there on Saturday. On
rnday, one of his aides, Mr. Gosohen, won the polo
stiok-and-ball race in good style, on a very nice-looking
Pony, but on Saturday, when all the society-folk were
present, the “ aides’ ” ponies were donkey-licked by a
'jP?looking, grey animal, bearing the appropriate name
™ The Shifter. The blue-jackets, artillerymen, and
Ir valr y me n fairly made Parramatta howl, during the
fhl e f d ? yBth ?y were there. A Murrumbidgee man won
ne tent-pegging, a Victorian the Turks’-head slicing, a
arramatta man the lemon-cutting, and a Camden horse
on the jumps, so things were pretty evenly divided.

A queer Sydney institution is the Model Yacht
Club—a number of people (not little boys, but great big
grown-up men, some of ’em with two-feet beards) —who
sail, on a puddle at Moore Park, little boats that you could
put in your waistcoat pocket. One of these potentates
has been to England, taking with him (in his cigarette-
case, probably) his “fast yacht Flying Cloud,"’and has
brought it back after winning 14 first prizes out of 16
races. “ Hooray for champion Australia 1” again shrieks
the press.

Dear Bulletin, —The prize for meanness has
been earned by the Sydney Association Cricket Ground
authorities. A number of trees utilised by the impe-
cunious to enable them to view the various amateur
athletic events on this ground, have been chopped down.
They were situated outside the dividing fence, between a
Bishop Smith and nothing, and represented possibly
£1 when the d.c. and gallery of each was filled. By the
way, why is not a gate placed on the eastern side for the
convenience of the eastern suburbs? —Sans Souci.
* * *
So the secret is out why Slavin’s backers have
“ turned dog ” on him. After his arrival in America he
was pitted against Jemmy Carroll, of Brooklyn. The
latter did as he pleased with the Australian, and but for
the intervention of Charley Mitchell would have knocked
him out. Of course, Slavin may have been in bad con-
dition.
* * *
When the cable announcing that Mitchell had
given Slavin a hiding on the Liverpool stage reached
people anticipated that the Australian would give “ rats”
to the Englishman—if a Brummagem Irishman can be so
called. But he hasn’t, as yet, and they say that Mitchell
and Pony Moore, his father-in-law, are now getting the
cream of the Slavin boom, and that when the latter is
played out Chawley will gain further glory by putting a
bigger head on the already bigheaded Australian.
# * #
Dear Bulletin, —Your correspondent opines
that Jackson will defeat Slavin if they meet, and that the
latter’s rushes will not come off, as he is too slow’. The
idea of saying that Slavin is slow ! I was present when
he fought Goode and big Joe M'Aulifle in England. Why,
the man hits like a flash, and is more like a demon in the
ring than anything I know. He is just the style of man
to worry Jackson down, taking a line from the latter’s
goes with Joe Goddard and Patsy Cardiff; and good
judges do not think Slavin w’ould have much trouble with
either. It must be remembered that the Slavin of to-day
is a different man from the Slavin they used to see at
Foley’s some three years ago. Then he was young and
raw and had not the full use of his strength. Since then
he has improved wonderfully in quickness, science, and
confidence, and I prophesy that when they meet it will
be a had time for Jackson. —Gumleaf.
# # #
One reason assigned for the unwillingness of
Mr. Piesse to back Slavin in America, is the fact that the
former presides over an English sporting club, and
naturally would wish to bring grist to his own mill. But
the excuse won’t stand. When Kilrain, an inferior man
to Jackson and Slavin, was in question, Slavin found
backing enough to fight in America.

In a Sydney second-hand shop the other day

“Ernie” Hutton, who made a big score for
Melbourne in the inter-University match, the other day,

South Australians certainly give George Giffen
credit for a wonderful knowledge of cricket. They say
now that he didn’t exert himself to make runs in the

Considering the dodges—some of them exceed-

The principal item on at Foley’s on Saturday
night was a finish-fight between “Yankee” and Thomas,
a pupil of Frank Pablo’s. They met a few weeks ago,
when Thomas, though winning, had to give in through
sheer exhaustion. On this occasion he did not run the
risk of getting worn-out, as he forced the pace and
knocked out his bigger and older opponent in four
rounds. With careful tuition, the winner should be
heard of again.

Old Tom Reibey of Entally (Tas.) who once
owned Stockwell and Malua (but he didn’t breed
them) still does a little racing, but the “all rose” seldom
shows to the front. The old gentleman is much too funky
for a racing man, and probably, as a rule, nominates just
for the sake of seeing his name on the Ust—nine out of
ten of his nominations are scratched. Ha is acknowledged
to he a first-class judge of a youngster, but. i« too
parsimonious to keep aristocratic stock, and pins his
faith on showy animals that never score a win.

Peter Maher, the Irish champion, lias challenged
the world to box or fight in any style. Maher is only a
middleweight, after the style of Mace and Sayers, and
every ounce of weight tells in a Queensberry contest. A
few years ago he was defeated by Hair for the English
amateur championship, and Jackson, on an exhibition
tour, knocked him out in Dublin. But he has since im-
proved a good deal. In London he made short work of
Gus Lambert who gave Jackson some trouble in America.
Since his arrival in America Maher has easily beaten half-
a-dozen heavy-weights. He is being engineered by the
astute Billy Madden, who may be said to have brought
out Johnel and Charley Mitchell. This fact alone shows
that Maher must be a good man. v

George Giffen, according to his fellow players,
was so incensed at the way the Sydney “larrikins”
barracked him that he made up his mind not to play

vailed.

On the night of the Cavill-Corbett swimming
match, in Sydney, L. Parkinson twice dived from a height

grief sooner or later. Verb sap.

The Melbourne tug-of-war is wholly inconclusive.
The French were Arabs and Algerians—some from Sells’
Circus—while the Germans worked on a system of prac-
tised knack, which gave them a favourable handicap.
The A.N. A. offers a £2O prize tor any team to beat the
victors, and confidently expects natives to do it. This
kind of thing needs to be rehearsed.

The tug -of - war is such a monstrously

Jack Hall, perhaps the cleverest lightweight
yet seen in Australia, who, for the last few years, has
followed up bookmaking, is anxious to re-enter the fistic
arena but cannot find an opponent.
The A.J.S. Bank officers are wondering
why their bonus on last year’s salary is only five
per cent, instead of 10 per cent., as usual. Does
the reduction, they ask, foreshadow the utter
abolition of bonuses, or are they now being made
to suffer for the rascality of ex-officer Cole, who,
despite that “infallible system of check,”
blasphemously annexed .£BOOO of the corporation’s
good red gold, right under the nose of Manager
Dibbs?
One of the many vagaries of a well-known
Bombay paper was perpetrated twenty-odd years
ago. The editor quarrelled with his partner, the
manager, and each appropriated a column to dis-
cussing the character of his partner, and to taking
the public into his confidence as to the causes of
the difference. The thing went on for some
weeks, until at last, the humour of the situation
having evaporated, fifty subscribers made an
effectual appeal to the two dissentients by sim-
ultaneously withdrawing their names. This
reminds us that a present-day Sydney journalist
once, in his callow journalistic day, ran on salary
a newspaper in a Victorian township. Under the
terms of his agreement, he had complete control
over the editorial “and news columns,” but on
one occasion he gave great umbrage to the pro-
prietor by taking up an attitude on a municipal
question opposed to that assumed by the latter in
the local shire council. The proprietor traversed
his editor’s view in a letter, which the scribbler
in a par., acknowledged having received, but pro-
nounced “to be unsuitable for publication because
of the unnecessary warmth of language used by
the correspondent.” Not to be outdone, the pro-
prietdr inserted his own letter in his advertising
columns, and appended to it a copy of a note
which he had addressed to the editor that day.
Needless to say what the note contained— a
mouth’s notice.
The Bulletin now sees clearly what is
coming out of the Lindsay “ exploring ” expedi
tion. A reef, capital .£500,000, in £1 shares.
The most beautiful edition of Tennyson’s

The officers of the British army are said
to be divided off into various syndicates and
limited companies, each interested in palming off
its own particular brand of inferior cannon, cronk
rifle, or putty “short-arm” upon the wretched
War Office.
By a decision last month in a London
court, the law is made clear that when a news-
paper publishes a report of a counsel’s address,
the allegations in which are not subsequently
substantiated by evidence in the case, “privilege”
does not govern the publication. The pasting-up
of this item in the offices of those Australian even-
ing newspapers which are sub-edited by “ boy-
labour,” should save a few thousands to the re-
spective proprietors.
The hopeless snobbery and irretrievable
hypocrisy of the present British social system
never received a happier illustration than the
circumstance that the name of the girl alleged to
have been seduced by Earl Russell was published
in the divorce-court and in the newspaper reports,
while that of the aristocratic libertine whose house
at Ascot (presided over by his mistress) was
visited by Lady Russell and her mother, was not
mentioned in examination, or by any daily paper.
The hectoring military cub who ranks as
first-born to Emperor William is the subject of
some infinitely touching anecdotes in a London
paper. One delectable little yarn tells how the
infant clapped his hands together when somebody
described Heaven as the “Golden City,” and
yelled, “How glad I shall be to get there ! For,
won’t I throw heaps of gold down to the poor
subjects here!” The sucking autocrat has already
swallowed the notion that he was ordained by
God to chuck other people’s money about.
The astonishing enlivenment of the pages
of the Times under its new management is
peculiarly-well illustrated in its law reports,
which, always the most admirable of their class,
have been remodelled till they read with a
“swing’’and “go” little short of dramatic. In
the recent slander-case, Mrs. Osborne against the
Hargreaves, who accused the plaintiff of stealing
Mrs. Hargreaves’ diamonds, all the by-play of
voice and gesture which so illuminates the dreari-
ness of court-procedure, and which often decides
the issues of a trial, is so well transcribed that the
lengthy report holds the attention like a shilling
novel.
The Calcutta Statesman, one of the best
of the Anglo-Indian newspapers, is owned by the
Maharajah of something, a wealthy minor poten-
tate. Twenty years ago, it was edited by Mr.
Robert Knight, a man who ran the gamut from
the church to journalism. He was a strong
advocate of pro-native views, and was the one
Englishman in India who held that had the
“ mutiny ” been the breaking out of a native force
against conquerors of any other European race
England would have applauded the revolt. He
was strong enough to express his opinion, but not
strong enough to hold his opinion in face of the
social ostracism which was extended to him. He
recanted, but only the other day his leader
translated into the vernacular was reprinted with
one sentence of comment by a Bengali editor.
The comment freely translated was: “We will
keep Mr. Knight’s words before our masters.”

A Narrow Squeak.
Dear Bulletin,— Re “ Malchook’s Doom,” your
story of the Nicholson River (N.Q.), I will tell
you a true adventure of an old friend of mine,
who camped on that river during the wet season
of ’B2-’B3 with a mob of store-cattle for the
Northern Territory. The blacks had been very
troublesome and had paid one or two visits to the
camp, as well as spearing many cattle. G. used
to sleep under a tarpaulin stretched over a ridge-
pole, the ends being open, and the sides also, for
about two feet from the ground. All the rations
were stored there, and G. had a bunk rigged up
on the spot. One night, after getting inside his
mosquito-net, he remembered that he had not put
his revolver under the pillow. He felt, at first,
too lazy to get up and get it, but finally, under
the pressure of a presentiment, he did so, and fell
asleep.
Now, mosquito-nets in the Far North are
generally made of coarse cheese-cloth to keep the
venomous little sand-flies out; the top and bottom
are of calico, with a slit in the bottom for en-
trance ; when rigged, they are like an oblong
box, and, naturally, after you have got in and
arranged your blankets, getting out again is a
work of time and difficulty. One thing is, that
although you can see out, no one can well
see in, unless there is a light behind the net.
G woke up suddenly that night, although
he was not aware of any sound having aroused
him. He lay for some time listening, when he
was conscious of some strange objects being visible
underneath the edge of the tarpaulin. It was
about full moon, and there was no doubt of what
the objects were : the legs of about seven or eight
blackfellows. Presently one looked cautiously in
at the end opening. G had been lying on his
back with one knee up ; unthinkingly he put his
leg down. The blackfellow, having the bunk
between himself and the other moonlit opening,
could see the movement, and instantly dropped
behind some bags of flour. G lay perfectly
still and waited, getting his revolver ready. Pre-
sently the nigger got up and cautiously advanced
club in hand. Once within the shadow of the
tarpaulin he could see nothing inside the mosquito-
net, although G. could see him plainly. Noise-
lessly he crept on until at last he was trying to
peer through the net, quite unconscious that he
was almost looking down the muzzle of G.'s pistol,
who settled matters by pulling the trigger. There
was a great clatter outside, and the wounded man
made a dive and scramble under the edge of the
tarpaulin and disappeared. The men, awakened
by the shot, came out of the tents, and one of them
hearing a noise in the river-bed went down the
bank and almost tumbled over the nigger crawling
on his hands and knees and coughing gouts of
blood up, for the bullet had gone into his mouth
and down his throat. G. had set his net on fire
when he fired the shot and was busy putting it out.
When he went outside, they picked up eight big
two-handed clubs that the blacks had dropped
during their hasty flight. It was the greatest
start they had had for some time.

you but a faint idea of general make and
finish, hut every Orchestra! Organette is
supplied with 28 IT’LL SIZED
AMERICAN ORGAN HEEDS, the same
size and quality as those used in a cabinet
organ. 'I lie reeds are placed in a novel
manner over a double suction bellows,
and arc controlled by THREE STOPS,
as follows, viz.. Flute, Expression and
Vox Humana. The music is produced by
perforated sheets, which pass around the
Organette in endless bands, enabling
a tune to be played over and over
again without stopping, furnishing
the GRANDEST ORCHESTRAL
EFFECTS, either in sacred, secular,
dance, or vocal music, affording a rich,
sonorous, and powerful accompaniment
to the voice, requiring absolutely no skill
in the performer, ami THE RANGE OF
MUSIC AND TONE IS PRACTICALLY
UNLIMITED. By the manipulation of
the stops, a tone as soft and sweet as a
zephyr, or a loud, long and swelling
melody may he produced; trills and high
falsetto, as well as reverberating bass,
and all manner of pleasing combinations
at the will of the performer.
We wish to introduce one of these
Orchestral Organettes into every town

Organette is a LARGE and POWERFUL INSTRUMENT, built exactly on the

thousands of pounds, and are so powerful they produce sufficient volume of music for the drawing-room, chapel lodge or ball
room There: is nothing about them to get out of order. They positively improv ofwith ngef sweeter 1 tones
after having been used a few years. For HOME ENTERTAINMENTS THEY ARE UNSURPASSED. Bear in mind that
each instrument has FOURTEEN MORE REEDS than any other Organette in the world and they in- ORGAN REEDS and
the special feature is THREE STOPS, a characteristic of no instrument except a costly organ.’ Our regular price for the
Orchestral Organette is Five Pounds. Having just put it before the public, we will sell a limited number to the readers of this

THE BEALE PATENT
HIGH ARM SEWING MACHINES
Have, by their continued merits and the general
satisfaction they have invariably given, won the
first place in public esteem, and are on all sides
admitted to be the best and most useful sewing
machines in the market.
EOR USE IN THE HOUSEHOLD
The Beale Machine presents innumerable advant-
ages. The mechanism and the' adjustments art-
perfect, while the working is most simple; and
the addition of all the most recent inventions and
improvements renders the manipulation of every-
thing connected with the machine a matter of
perfect ease. The result of this is, that with
ordinary care the machine will last for many
years, nothing can get out of order, and no time
is wasted in tiresome meddling with the parts.
It is a servant that will never grumble, never
rebel, never want nights out, willing even on
washing days. It only asks for a careful cleaning
now and then, a snug, dry corner and a little
genuine sowing machine oil. Any other oil will
make it sick, and dirt of all kind it abhors.
The Self-threading Shuttle, of solid steel,
saves the trouble of threading by the end of the
cotton. It has an excellent tension, is strong and
simple.
The Bobbin Winder is a marvel of in-
genuity, winding and guiding the cotton by
itself, as evenly as upon the reel whence it came,
and stopping of its own accord when the bobbin
is full.
For all kinds of family sewing and fancy the
Beale Machine has the greatest capacity.
T.. e Improved High Arm. A great de-
sideratum with ladies has been the raising of the
arm of the machine, so as to allow the goods to be
sewn freely to pass underneath. This had to bo
accomplished without increasing the weight of the
machine. In fact, the Beale runs with wonderful
ease and rapidity. It is almost silent, all clicking
sounds having been obviated. As is well known,
a good test of the finish of any mechanism is its
silence when in rapid motion.
With the Wonderful Beale Machine,
whether for hand or foot use, you can hem any
width, make double seams or fells, braid stitch
with chenille, Berlin wool, or gold cord, and Such
like fancy work ; yon may make a pretty lace
stitch, tuck ever so finely, bind dresses, coats, or
carpets ; sew on trimmings without guiding, make
frilling, ruffling, or ruenmg; quilt, weave your
own braid with any combination of colours and
stitch it on at the same time ; make thick, woollen
door-mats, embroidered antimacassars, window
curtains, and so forth ; you can easily and rapidly
perform the fashionable shirring or gathering so
popular for sleeves, bodies, or skirts of dresses
with an appliance supplied gratis ; lay the small
cords in hoods and stays ; do large cording ; gather
with or without a band, and generally do all
kinds of straight sewing upon any material what-
ever. You can darn upon any woven goods, and
do crewel-work. The Beale Patent will pass
from eight folds of tweed or twenty of calico to
two of thinnest muslin, or even mosquito-net or
tulle, without the operator changing needle,
cotton, stitch, or tension, and the fine material
will not be gathered in the slightest. Yon may
make button and eyelet-holes, do over-casting,
make herring-bone stitch upon any materials.
This work is absolutely unique and can only be
accomplished upon the Beale Patent Machine.
Any of these performances will bo shown at our
shops at any time. The Beale Patent makes
a lock-stitch, which cannot ravel, yet by a momen-
tary alteration the sewing can be done so as to
rip from end to end, if desired. This peculiarity
is sometimes useful when children’s clothes are
intended to be altered.
Nickel-plating’. —ln our climate the exposed
parts of the machine, and the applieances, need
to be protected from rust. We have, at consider-
able expense, added a handsomely nickeled wheel,
nickeled plates, screws, appliances, treadle-bar
and cones. Heightening the appearance, these
improvements also tend largely to preserve the
parts. This plating is imperishable.
A special feature of The Beale Machine is
that
ALL THE CABINET WORK
is made at our factory in Sydney from registered
designs, and of the choicest
AUSTRALIAN WOODS,
some of which are without doubt the most beauti-
ful in the world. Suitability to the climate is
thus insured, and we are enabled to offer a greater
variety of styles, most handsome in design and
conveniently fitted for all the requirements of a
lady’s work-table.
These machines can he inspected at any time at
our principal show-rooms in Sydney, or at any of
our suburban and country branch shops, or from
travellers who are continually visiting all parts.
All the machines may bo had upon easy time-
payment, or for oasli less three shillings in the
pound.

that Australia is a country of some importance,

According to Secretary Knapp, of the
Local Option League, N.S.W. spent in drink
during 1882-90, <£39,760,997, or more than it has
altogether spent in State railways, and more than
the value of all the gold yet extracted from its
soil.
At a recent Melbourne sale of unredeemed
pledges, an old lady made a bid—the only one—
of Is. for a large family Bible. “ What,” quoth
the auctioneer, “Is. for a .£5 Bible!” “Oh,”
replied the old lady, in a matter-of-fact way, “the
Bible’s gone out of date ; nobody reads it now.”
George Houston Reid, leader of the
N.S.W. Opposition, was no end of a cricketer
some score of years ago, and on one occasion
played with his office, the Treasury, against the
Registrar-General’s Office. The R.G.’s stayed in
the whole afternoon, and late in the evening
George was put on to bowl as a last resource,
“ h ow then, gentlemen, we have him,” said
George, affixing his eyeglass, and he delivered his
first ball, which passed some six feet over the bats-
man’s head, and was duly no-balled.
An Adelaide writer tells this about the late
Major O’Halloran, who owned O’Halloran Hill,
Mount Barker way, S.A. Near the boundary of
his land was a permanent well, much used by
travellers. What “riled” the Major was that
teamsters frequently left the slip-rails down, thus
making stock liable to stray. At last, being
determined to shut off the supply, he erected a
notice-board, bearing the legend “ Major O’Hal-
loran’s well.” When next he visited it he found
that some waggish drover had elaborately added a
postscript : “Glad to hear it. Hope Mrs.
O’Halloran’s well, too.”

Whereas, I suffered very severely from a very

Father Anderledy, Jesuit Chief, director

a portrait of Anderledy, a horribly grim-looking,
lean, tall man.
A Sydney doctor made an awkward mis-
take the other day. There was a little girl among
his patients, and she lived in one of these terraces
where every house is built exactly alike. There-
fore the doctor, being in a hurry, dashed into the
wrong house, charged upstairs to the bed-room,
found another little girl in bed there, and seeing
that she was evidently convalescent gave her half
a glassful of evil-smelling medicine and went off.
When he was gone the infant aroused the house
with her shrieks and explained the outrage which
a strange man had perpetrated upon her, and her
father ran 300 yards or so in pursuit of the doctor
with a large poker, but luckily failed to overtake
him. This is only one of the many evils of the
terrace system. It is related on unreliable
authority that another Sydney surgeon was so
much deceived once by the awful similarity of
terrace houses that he cut off the leg of the man
next door by mistake, but the error was hushed up
to save the credit of the profession.
Dear Bulletin, —It amuses me to see
statistics quoted. As an Excise officer I had for
four or five years to collect the agricultural returns
for a large English district. The system was to
send out schedules by post to the occupiers, who
were supposed to fill in and return. Anyone
acquainted with the average Hodge knows how
this was done. The work had to be got through
in a few weeks—as many months were really
necessary—and I received a dole of £6 from the
Board of Trade, whereas were the thing properly
performed £100 would be too little. Officials high
and low regarded the thing as a farce, and our
instructions were to strike a balance anyhow, and
get through as quickly as possible. An Excise
inspector once publicly declared that the agricul-
tural returns were not worth the paper on which
they were printed. How many schedules have I
filled in with my left hand —occasionally adding
“donkeyin the column for horses to give an air
of realism to Hodge’s supposed return? A few
months after the returns were published and
every paper in the kingdom had a leading article
on the country’s agricultural progress. How the
2000 Excise officers who collected them sniggered !
—Yours,
Ex-Tax-Collector.
IT RECALLS THE BLIZZARD.
In March, 1888, the great blizzard in America
almost extinguished the city of New York. The
like of it was never before seen. The snow com-
pletely stopped all local traffic. Not a horse or a
wheel could move. All the telegraph lines lead-
ing into the city were prostrated, and for two or
three days the people of Boston and New York
communicated with each other by way of London
by means of the Atlantic cables. Thus messages
intended for three hundred miles distant were
sent six thousand miles, crossing the ocean twice.
An incident which recalls this experience to the
writer’s mind happened a short time ago here in
England. Suppose we let the gentleman in-
terested tell his own story. He says: “I have
suffered more or less from indigestion and
dyspepsia all my life. I had a bad taste in the
mouth, pain after eating, a poor appetite, and
sour stomach. My tongue was coated, and my
mouth constantly filled with a watery fluid. No
matter what I ate, however light, it disagreed
with me and gave me pain. I had fulness of the
chest, and pain at my side, with a miserable, low,
dull feeling. From time to time I consulted a
doctor who gave me medicines, but they did very
little good. The doctor said that the coating of
my stomach was disordered, and the mucous
membrane was inflamed. In 1877 I received a
pamphlet from New York telling of a medicine
called Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup, and of the
extraordinary cures it had effected, so I procured
a supply, and after taking the first I felt better,
and by the time I had taken four bottles more, I
was completely cured, and have been in good
health, as regards the indigestion, ever since.
Having studied the practice of herbs for many
years, 1 was in the habit of treating people for
erysipelas and other complaints, and was fre-
quently consulted by people in the district, so
after my remarkable cure, I was so impressed
with the merits of Seigel’s Syrup, that I procured
a large supply of the medicine, and recommended
it to all who were suffering, and people came from
far and near for it. I may mention that on a
Sunday ray house was beseiged by miners from
Coal Pit Heath, and others from a distance. On
every hand I heard nothing but the loudest praise
of it and of the cures it effected, and the fame of
this medicine was spread throughout the West of
England with no other advertising than one party
telling another of the benefit they had derived
from this wonderful medicine. • I wish every one
to know of this, and if by publishing this state-
ment it will help others who may be suffering as I
was, it will afford me pleasure.”
The letter from which the foregoing is an
extract is signed Moses Godwin, Old Sqdbury
(Sodbury), Glos., and is dated April 9th, 1891.
He is a farmer.
The reader will notice that while the head-
quarters for the sale of Mother Seigel’s Syrup is
universally known to be in London, by a strange
chance Mr. Godwin’s first information concerning
it came from America, three thousand miles away,
which recalls the incident of the American blizzard
above narrated, and also shows that the fame and
usefulness of this medicine extend to all civilised
countries. ' *
Mr. Benjamin Edgerton, grocer and provision
dealer, Plat Lane, Whixall, Whitchurch, Salop,
says: “While living with Mr. Roberts, Fens
Woods Farm, I first began to feel a .dull, heavy
weight at my side, and noticed a bad taste in the
mouth with foul stomach and uncomfortable feel-
ing after eating. I had n6 appetite, and when I
sat down to the table I could not touch the food.
X had a good deal of pain and noise in the head,
and could not sleep for it. .1 was not fit for heavy
work, and could only do light jobs abput the
farm. After cutting a hedge I would go quite
faint, and had to. sit down, and felt so much
depressed I could have cried. Having always
been such a strong man I took it badly to be
reduced to such a weak state. I took all kinds of
physic and saw a doctor, but his medicine only
eased me; for a bit, and then. I was. worse than
before. I went on in this way for over a year,
when a servant that came to live at Mr. Roberts
told me of a medicine called Mother Seigel’s
Syrup. She had heard a gentleman talking about
it in thq’railway carriage, and he praised it so
much that I thought I would try it. After I had
taken two bottles fhy food did me good, and I
gained strength, and by persevering with the
syrup I soon got as strong as ever, and have never
ailed anything since.”
In Memoriam.
CARDINAL MANNING, 1808—1892.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Another noble spirit passed away 1
Whose sympathies disdained to be suppressed
By creed or social statute. Of the oppressed
True champion 1 ever foremost in the fray,
When Right, down-trodden, strove to hold at bay
The greedy tyrant. One who, much caressed
In brightest places, ne’er to cry distressed
Turned a deaf ear, or said the suppliant nay!
In fullness of his time he gains the prize,
And claims his,well-earned diadem of grace ;
And England, grief-bowed, stands, with tear-dimmed eyes,
Seeking if there be one to fill his place
And worthily uphold, in all men’s sight,
His glorious standard, “ God defend the right.”
Another warrior-priest has joined his peers !
That eagle-vision, which nought here could sate,
Has pierced the mystery beyond life’s gate,
And found the haven often sought with tears.
His was a fearless nature. Through long years
He gave Right his allegiance ; consecrate
To one high purpose, self to subjugate
And serve his God, as did the prophet-seers.
Leaders of thought die not. It is their high
And proud prerogative, sun-crowned, to stand
Fronting the ages. Time will pass them by
And not efface their footprints from the strand;
But in our hearts their best memorial lives
And to our lives a nobler impulse gives.
Melbourne, 15/l/’92.
A.V.G.
“ For 30 years this remote and solitary
city was his home.”—London Black and White
on Bishop Perry and Marvellous Melbourne.
Nob only was Cardinal Manning a widower,
but he had two children, who died in infancy.
Here are facts which throw a light on the causes
of his efficiency and sympathy.
The polite people of Bathurst, N.S. W.,
don’t say of a traveller “ Redraws the long bow„”
but “ How long is his snake? ” They merely ask
the question. The seven-foot snake which i£ four
feet long by standard measure is familiar to every
bushman.
Mr. J. B. Winter, President of the W.A.
Trades and Labour Council, asks us to give notice
to Michael Knight and his brother Thomas,
bricklayers (present address unknown), who were
in Perth five or six years ago and worked at one
time in Guildford, that two blocks of land belong-
ing to the former and now becoming valuable have
been fenced in by some land-shark who evidently
intends to jump them.
R. A. Thompson and Co., Sydney, send
us the first number of the Victorian Magazine,
a new and fairly-illustrated sixpenny London
serial. The first number contains a hitherto
unpublished essay by Thos. De Quincey, on the
French Revolution, and is further contributed to
by Mrs. Oliphant, Charles G. Leland (translator
of Heine), Professor Church, Sarah Tytler, Sarah
Doudney, 0. F. Gordon-Cumming, and others.
We have read “Nora, or a Strange Re-
demption,” by Mary Angela Dickens—the grand-
daughter of the great novelist; we have also read
a number of opinions by critical wiseacres who
hail the young novelist as one upon whom her
great progenitor’s mantle has fallen. The story is
clever, but not especially well-written, and no
more indicates an inheritance of genius than
Richard Cromwell's abortive efforts at state-craft
evidenced consanguinity with the mighty Lord-
Protector.
It seems pretty clear that Dr. Mueller, of
Victoria (not the Baron), has established the
success of his (now that the rationale of the treat-
ment is demonstrated) obviously commonsense
treatment, by liquor-strychnise injection, of
snake-bite. Should further tests uphold the
efficacy of the Mueller treatment, it will be alike
the privilege and the duty of the Australian
Governments to recognise by a handsome honora-
rium the splendid service conferred upon humanity
by this unobtrusive German scientist. Apropos,
somebody writes to the papers singing the praises
of eucalyptus as a snake-bite remedy. The fact
that the aborigines don’t" use eucalyptus argues
strongly against this theory.
Editor Bulletin, Sydney,—Allow me to
take exception to a statement in your last, to the
effect that “ Grandmaster Powderly, of the
Knights of Labour, is a cast-iron Protectionist,
anyhow.” If his own utterances are to be relied
on, he is nothing of the kind, for it is only a short
time ago since he wrote, in the Knights of
Labour Journal : “ It seems to me that the policy
of Protection is a wrong upon labour. The
labouring classes are not protected—only the
manufacturers. The rich receive the protection.
The American manufacturer adds the duty to
what should be the natural and fair price of his
product. The burden of the tariff rests its crush-
ing weight 'upon the poor. It is the poor, the
great mass of the people, who need protection,
and they will never get it under the so-called
policy of Protection.” The above does notread
like an extract from a Protectionist speech, and,
as a matter of fact, Powderly, instead of being
an advocate of Protection, is an out-and-out
Single-taxer.—Yours, &c., J.C., Windsor, Jan. 24.

RUNNING THE ASSASSINS DOWN.
The brace of dark-skinned fiends who so merci-
lessly despatched the unfortunate foreigner,
Mursezvitz, at Dora Dora, on the 2nd May last,
for the purpose of possessing themselves of the
little money and goods he had scraped together
by plodding industry and self-denial, have con-
tinued so far to keep a safe distance between their
pursuers and themselves, and this, too, notwith-
standing the
PROMPT AND HOT PURSUIT
of the officers of justice in their very tracks.
Through stretches of wild country, now on the
trail, then off it, over swollen creeks, through
almost impassable brushwood, across mountain-
ridges, or threading an uncertain course under the
gloom of towering trees in the bewildering
primeval forest, the messengers commissioned to
act a prominent part in clearing up
A CRUEL CRIME
have hunted these outlawed aborigines without
success. Once or twice hope dawned, but only to
be crushed in its creation. The wild character of
the country formed the savages’ shield, until just
when fears were merging into despair that the
murderers had escaped for ever from the grip of
earthly justice, the news was brought that
THEY HAD BEEN SEEN
in the vicinity of Tamworth, and still later near
the Macleay. A remarkable incident connected
with the search was the discovery in one of the
most lonesome spots visited by the police of the
remains of what had been a camp fire. This, it
was at first believed, might afford a clue to the
whereabouts of the fugitives. Closer examination,
however, showed that the camp had not been that
of a blackfellqw, while the finding close by of a
bottle that had recently contained St. Jacobs Oil,
the great pain conqueror and bushman's friend,
left
NO ROOM FOR DOUBT
but that a prudent swagsman had halted at the
spot. The immense value of St. Jacobs Oil to
persons much exposed to the elements is widely
recognised ; while the simplicity of its application,
together with the wonderful curative qualities it
possesses in all cases of rheumatism, neuralgia,
sprains, gout, bruises, &c., renders it a valuable
adjunct to the labourer, the farmer, and the
squatter.

“ Three Hundred a Year”: A Politico-
Social Study.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The difference between an ordinary citizen
n( j a member of Parliament is the difference
between sweet insignificance and Damnable
think that a member’s life is all
Grlory and Glou-Glou.
Bah!
Pride hurled Satan into Hell; Envy, the
Mother of Pride, sucks men into Parliament.
The result is the same to the victims.
# * *
Notice the town member, how he goes ;
be smiles not, neither doth he grin—if you could
rea d the dark and troubled sea of emotions that
ddle up beneath his ample white waistcoat.
His house, or shop, or office, is the rendezvous of
hundreds of perfect strangers, who call him
familiarly by name, tell him how hard they fought
to get him returned, worry him with their private
woes, rush him off to dark-corner prayer and
other meetings, and borrow his shillings lavishly.
He has to have seven different addresses each
week if he wants any time to himself; has to whip
into Parliament House with an unexpected rush
at all sorts of odd moments from the cavern of a
cab in order to be present at any debate, for he
dare not remain there in daylight, except when
preconcerted signals and instructions have been
arranged for. Where he sleeps is a mystery.
# * *
But the woes of the town member are
nothing as compared with those of the country
member.
A country member must live at an hotel, or
have a family house, and he must have an office
where telegrams and letters from his constituents
may easily reach him. Woe be to the country
member who fails to reply at once to any
“collect” wire from a distant supporter—who,
no matter how insignificant abroad, is always a
“ prominent citizen ” in his own township, and
can call up local hurricanes at will.
A knowing country member should —and often
(j oes _have two offices ; a secret one to which he
retreats whenever his chances let him; and an
advertised one, where he is never found, and
where he keeps a faithful clerk to tell lies for him,
and to let him know things ; or, if he can’t afford
a faithful clerk, there is always to be found a
door-notice —“Back in about 20 minutes.”
It is well to be careful of the “about,” for it
makes the constituents, or deputation, doubtful
when they return from a first call whether the
member hasn’t been in and gone again while they
dallied with town delights. But, in any case, a
member can always afterwards explain that a
thousand pressing public duties bullock-hauled
him away just at that particular time.
A country member’s hotel, or private house, is
never safe against intruding friends from the
wilds, which made him what he is.
If I were a country member of say, the N.S.W.
Parliament, I should like to be the member for
the Soudan, Africa I might get a little peace in
that situation. *
The country visitor to town regards his parti-
cular member in the light of a bank, in which he
is a shareholder, and from which he can draw
sovereigns at call on the strength of I 0 U’s.
Country deputations regard visits to the
metropolis as being made up of an hour’s sober
interview with a Minister of the Crown, and
three days’ wild orgy with their member as their
pilot, or, at least, their stand-by.
One beetle-browed ruffian will swoop upon his
country member just outside his hotel, and calling
up three or four more beetle-browed ruffians in
painfully new slop suits, he will airily hiccough
with a comprehensive arm-sweep round the whole
horizon—
“ My frens, Misshur Basham, meramer for
Shoggeroggera (hie) ; Misshur Basham, shese are
four o’ your mosh hard-working shporters ” (hie).
This always happens just at lunch-time, and
Basham, M.P., understands his duty too well not
to invite them in, first to drink and then to eat.
Overcome by the splendour of their surroundings
and fearing to offend their member after his
graciousness, these intruders “wolf” religiously
through the bill of fare, item by item, from top to
bottom, from oysters even unto coffee. When
asked what they will drink they always say “a
small bottle.”
I know a member whose last four bashful
lunohers cost him just £4 16s.
* » #
When the country member visits his
native heath these same beetle-browed consti-
tuents are too humble to presume to ask so great
and distinguished a man to grace their humble
boards; they know their proper places too well
for that!
No, they visit him at the Joggeroggera Hotel,
and as he is again their host, the hotel becomes
an open house for them. Moreover, as the local
police wink at the mighty local member—for hath
he not influence towards promotion?—the land-
lord is not particular about the law, but takes
unusual privileges as to hours, &c., and the hotel
is practically a pandemonium all night, from
which there is no escape for the country member.
Should he try to dodge his admirers by going to
bed at eleven o’clock, they swarm with un-
diminished enthusiasm into his bedroom, light the
candle, sit down upon his bed, and drunkenly
talk him into a cold sweat.
He endures it for the least possible period com-
patible with duty, and so soon as he can get the
editor of the local paper insensibly alcoholised,
and his buggy out of the frantic hands of his loving
constituents, he flies swiftly back to the city.
* * *
But though his constituents whom he
thus leaves behind cannot reach him by hand-
grasp, they can by telegraph.
Herein he lies completely at their mercy. They
send him “ collect ” messages in “ loose-extension ”
form, quite indifferent that they are expressing in
47 words what might have been said with equal
felicity and intelligibility in seven. Their trouble !
He’s a “ member,” and he gets £3OO a year from
the bleeding country, and “ we got him the billet!”
So he curses, and pays for the ‘‘ collect ” messages;
and looks pleasant, and pays for the necessary
replies.
This little item of telegrams, with postage-
stamps added (stationery is provided at Parlia-
ment House), will cost the most ordinary country
member at least £1 a week—unless he is a very
clever man; some it costs as much as £3 per
week, half their Parliamentary salary.
Watty Adams, M.L.A. for Bundaberg, Queens-
land —and I don’t see why Bananaland should be
more expensive in these lines than N.S.W.—
assured me once that for many weeks his tele-
graphic expenses amounted to from £0 to £l5 per
week ! 1 interpolate this because when I heard it,
I thought the statement excessive; yet Watty is a
sober and truthful man.
• * •
It must not be supposed that the
“collect ” telegrams from the constituents always,
or even often, refer to public business. Quite the
opposite. The country member is the constituents’
bank, whenever they choose to fancy that they
have anything to tell him.
For instance, Constituent Spudriver wires
down some information most important to himself,
and Basham gets a telegraphic envelope marked —
“ Collect, wds., .”
He pays the money, opens the telegram and
reads:
To Basil Basham, Esq., M.L.A.
Hotel , Sydney.
I am going to get married next Thursday to Lucy Ann
Downcreek, and we come to Sydney for the honeymoon.
I want you to engage us rooms somewhere—slap-up style
and no flies. You remember her, flue girl, with flashing
black eyes, and grand figure. She, what danced so well
at the Selectors’ Ball, time you was there. First met her
time I was canvassing for yon, through the Round Scrub.
Will wire you again what train to meet us by.
J. Spudrivef.
This telegram means two levies on Basham,
M.P.—(l) A wedding present; (2) engaging ex-
pensive apartments in his own name.
He goes and does the latter at once, and, in
doing it, runs several risks, among which are (1)
that the bride-elect may throw over J. Spudriver
in the meantime ; (2) that the bridegroom may get
so drunk that, by the time he reaches the city, he
has to be nursed through the jimjams at Basham’s
expense.
The above telegram is very similar to one sent
two years ago to a country member. The subject
was a honeymoon, and the country member had
to pay for the honeymoon residence and press a
cheque into the bride’s hand (she was the wife of
the chairman of his Cow Flat committee) instead
of himself selecting a bridal gift for her. It only
cost him £32 11s,, not counting the telegrams and
the law-costs, for the hotelkeeper had to sue him
to get the money.
* * *
Then the keen-nosed country constituent
wires to his member :
A son is born unto us. Have you any objection to my
naming the boy after you ? I voted for you several times,
and have a great admiration of your character so far.
The boy is a fine fellow, fully 141b5., and I hope the child
will grow’ up to be a conscientious and useful citizen and
an honour and glory to his country, which he will if he
takes you for a pattern. Collect.
The member wires back :
No objection; proud to be thought of; congratulate
you.
Then, when the boy’s full name is known, the
member has to find a silver mug for, and stand
fairy godfather to, him. Lots of people find it
far cheaper to be own father to a child than god-
father.
* * #
Then the happy father has a childless
neighbour, who sees and ponders over these things.
He is envious, and lets the matter worry him.
At last, a bright idea arrives.
He owns a dog / So he wires straightway to the
godfather member :
I have named my dog after you ; please forward brass
collar, with your name in full inscribed upon it. You
know the dog—a black-and-white, woolly-haired sort of
collie cattle-dog ; four years old now, so you know what
sized collar. Collect.
The collar is sent!
Now, the member who is the victim of this
dog imposition happens to have a melodious, dis-
syllabic, tongue-handy name that is not a misfit
for a high-toned canine. He was telling a couple
of pressmen about it, when one said
“Well, it isn’t every member who has a name
that would fit a dog!”
Icicles were precipitated on the spot.
# # *
Your pietist is the expert at running a
cheap election. They dew say that Alfred Allen,
the N.S.W. temperance and insurance man, is a
perfect master in the art of getting returned on
the strength of his many and great, though by us
unseen, virtues.
The late David Buchanan, of N.S.W., was pro-
verbial for cheap and nasty electioneering.
Davvvid once stood for Mudgee, while a church
bazaar was being promoted. An ordinarily
squeezable member cannot hope to get rid of a
bazaar canvasser under two or three guineas.
David, in his capacity as next member was
approached on bazaar business by a fetching young
lady.
“ And what church dae ye rapresent, ma dear
girl ?” enquired Dawicf.
“ Presbyterian,” she artfully replied, thinking
David was o’ the kirk.
“ Ma dear chiel,” said David in his most im-
pressive and grandiloquent tone, “ I don’t believe
in ony churches instituted by Man. Ma church is
the Church of Nature, an’ nae ither, where I
staun’ under the blue, o’erarching canopy o’
Heeven, an’ drink ma fill. As I gaze upon the
gigantic an’ bauttlemented crags, an’ hear the crash
an’ the reverberation o’ the thunner, God’s own
awe-inspirin’ artillery, I feel ma sowl respond to
its graund anthems, an’ I feel ma hairt lifted
up far, far beyond the most magneefioent cathe-
dral that’s but b’ human haundiwark. Ah ! ma
dear chiel, believe me, the releegion o’ the a’-en-
during ages is the releegion o’ the Church o’
Nature.”
And not a domned cent would Dawvid give !
• * *
John Hurley, once of Queensland, was
contesting Central Cumberland (N.S.W.) when
he had plenty of shekels. He instructed his elec-
tion committee “ to go to any reasonable extent ”
in anything which they thought would advance
his electioneering interests. They took him at
his word.
A day or two afterwards he was startled in his
hotel apartments by a hideous row. He went
upon the balcony and saw a drag attached to a
magnificent team of four white horses, a brass
band, and a cheering and frantic crowd. With a
deep, unheard curse of disgust he drew back into
the apartment, drawing with him his wife, who
had followed him to the balcony.
“Oh!” exclaimed Madame, woman-like, plea-
surably excited at the spectacle—“oh ! John, do
go out and show yourself. These people evi-
dently think a lot of you !”
Those people thought so much of John that he
received from them, a few days later, a bill for
£35, as the charge for the drag and for the band's
expenses, “ including lunches !” A brass bands-
man’s lunch—likewise his lunch-bill —is an awe-
some thing.
That election cost John Hurley over .£llOO.
* * *
John also contested Lithgow, but this
time he hadn’t a million to spend. Nevertheless,
he was successful.
After the declaration of the poll, the rival eleo-

who might be induced to marry the girl—there
was no knowing. In the end all parties went over
to the “case.” The rival candidate “did the
right thing,” and Hurley added :
“I’ll tell you what i’ll do, boys : I’ll give the
widow my first month’s salary, <£25.”
Which he duly did.
Whereupon the lady immediately got married,
with great splendour.
* * *
I here remember that a candidate once
tried to boom his election on a reputation for phil-
anthropy. He headed a subscription for buying
a mangle for a needy widow ; ho raised the
money, bought the mangle, and his chances looked
promising. But some noser found out that he
took the new mangle to his own home, and sent
the widow his own old one ! That killed his can-
didature, and he has had to lie low politically
ever since, though it is an unswerving article of
faith with his son that his dad was only beaten
“because he promised to poll-tax Irishmen.”

Do politics pay % It depends on the man.
With a generous man who has naught else to
depend on, the ,£3OO a year means ruin. But
where do the counterpoising perks come in ? It is
said, and I believe it, that, since Labor has
organised and developed its fighting strength,
Labor men can run their elections cheaply. But,
when they are once safely elected do they get
“ milked” as the moneyed members do, or did ? If
so, it’s good-bye to all chance of their effecting
strong work. A man who is “ bled white” must
be amenable to insidiously offered chances of
earning money apparently not dishonourably.
And then ? Conscience weakens always towards
its possessors, and a poor man so placed must
gradually develope into a “ professional Conserva-
tive.”

Editor Bulletin,— At Maclean (N.S.W.)a man named
Smith shot at a kanaka, but so unreliable was his aim
that he injured a little girl, and now two charges are
brought against him—viz., shooting with intent and
inflicting grievous bodily harm. The grievous bodily
harm must be regarded by law as purely an accident, for
if it is proven that Smith aimed for the kanaka, to charge
him with shooting the little girl is as reasonable as it
would be to arraign him likewise for attempted suicide,
had the pistol discharged at the wrong end and done
business with Smith. Again, if the charge of grievous
bodily harm is of any account-, that of bloodthirsty atten-
tions to the kanaka must be wrongly laid. Now, how
would the case go, supposing Smith went out, gun in
hand, with the expressed intention of killing somebody
else, and by mistake aimed at the kanaka, still fetching
the little girl ? In this case there can be only one charge
against the man Smith ; either that of shooting with
intent, or inflicting grievous bodily harm ; but the most
rational charge to prefer would be that of “ missing the
kanaka”—that is to say, “ hitting the little girl."’—Yours,
&c., Solon.
The Awakening.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
They had lived together for seven years, and were
more or less married “after God’s holy ordinance ”
—more or less because, although all formalities had
been complied with, the Church obeyed, and
social laws subscribed to, yet the Divine consum-
mation of •“ one flesh ” was a dream only that died
witli the echo of the marriage peal.
The end of the first month brought the awaken-
ing—a word, a misunderstanding, a sneer, a
retort —and the two were two again, the dream
over, and they faced eacli other across the bottom-
less abyss of a fatal dissimilarity. They did not
quarrel—it was bad form ; nor had they time, so
busy were they in fortifying themselves in the
little castle of their own regrets and decorating
the walls thereof with pictures of what might have
been ; under one roof, and yet so far apart; within
the same four walls, and yet in different
worlds; of the same name, husband and wife, and
yet unrelated ; but the world knew nothing of it.
Harry Walford’s perfect form and absolute
politeness to his wife was, among their friends, a
perennial topic of conversation, and her complete
coincidence with his every wish made other men
envious. “ They are so confoundedly civil to each
other, they really might be mere acquaintances, 5 '
people said —the fact that they were so was the
explanation. With all this they were neverthe-
less quite above the level of the common herd of
men and women, two distinct and well-marked
personalities—electro-plated, the one with an
amalgam of commerce and domestic reticence,
the other with a cursed sense of inappreciation :
they sat, fed, slept together, and sometimes
kissed, but the whole thing was bloodless,
metallic, of the earth earthy. They lived as it were
in a fog of unreality, through which the souls of
both of them still peered hopefully for some bright
morning dawn of helpful and heartful companion-
ship.
One day brought the unexpected news of great
wealth left them, and they sat the evening
through in her boudoir and talked of luxuries to
come —horses, carriages, a town and country
house and a cottage on the river—to all she gave
a hollow acquiescence, but told herself, as he left
the room, that life would still be empty for her,
for “love was all, and wealth was nought,” and
he, as he mounted the stairs, was telling himself
the same sickening certainty.
In one particular this unhappy pair stood alone,
there was in the case of neither of them any
haunting memory of a first love, a mad passion
unrequited ; they met, admired, married, and
risked the mating, and the mating never came—
that was all.
That night she went early to bed, and he, still
dressed, went to her room half determined to talk
to her for once from his heart and of his thirst for
a real union of souls after the manner of God’s
cementing; so drawing her low chair to the
fire he threw himself into it and wrestled with
himself for a while, and in the end compromised
matters by speaking unto her in parables. He
told her of himself through the disguise of an
imaginary friend of his—an awfully good chap,
with the warmest heart and strongest hand to do
great things in the world —move mountains and
stir people, if only he had some woman to love
him, some earnest, clinging, trusting one who
would invite him to be at once “a man and fold
her with an arm, a God and hold her with a
charm.” And she, listening with the eyes, ears
and.mouth other, had slowly risen from her pillow
on to one elbow to ask :
“ Is he married? ”
“ Yes,” the reply came slowly, “ to an iceberg.”
For half-an-hour he talked on and on, and never
before had she known the better part of him—the
silent half —grow eloquent after this fashion ; and
she, too, for the first time tasted something of
life’s possibilities, all kinds of thoughts in her
struggled for utterance. Conventionality fought
with kindliness, the loyal wife with a tender
womanhood, and victory passed culture by and
crowned the Innate. Then falling back on the
pillow she groaned out—“ Oh ! that I could help
this man—write to him, or, or .”
“You may write to him.”
“But would it not be against every conven-
tional law? What would the world say?—what
will you say ?”
“ As far as I am concerned I would sacrifice
anything to see my friend happy, and as for social
laws they have always stood in the way of God’s
commands and have been sacrificed.”
And so the matter was arranged and the corres-
pondence started, and her letters, full of a holy
love and a yearning to be of help to him, went to
the club addressed to “ Chas. Terrain,” and her
husband read them there and had them answered
on club paper.
The subject after the first day was never men-
tioned, but the whole atmosphere of home life
was slowly changing, a late spring was breaking
in upon the winter of their discontent. There
were handsqueezings, evening walks, and real
kissings now.
A month over and they were man and wife
indeed —one flesh, but for on her side the hideous
consciousness of the fact that she was still carry-
ing on a correspondence that she had neither the
right nor the wish to continue. “ Why should she
share with another a love that her husband was
now, by every law of God and man, entitled to
in its entirety? Would she ever be in a position
to return his constant glance of absolute trust and
confidence?” were questions she asked herself
daily, and prayed each night that soon it might
be so.
One day she made her resolve, and with a
woman’s impetuosity sat down there and then to
carry it out. She wrote to this “ Charles Jerram ”
and asked him as a great favour to grant her one
meeting, and hear from her own lips why the
thing should end.
I will be at the Albert Memorial, beneath the chestnuts
on the right, at 10.30 to-morrow (she wrote). Will you
meet me there, wearing a red carnation? This corres-
pondence, commenced so strangely, has been, you are
good enough to say, helpful to you ; to me it has been
more so than you can ever guess. Why should itcontinue?
Two travellers in a mountainous country have met where
a glacier yawned, and given eaeli other a hand over ; what
remains but to say “ good-bye? ”
Five minutes before the time appointed she was
there on the seat and endeavouring to form some
sort of picture of the man she was about to meet.
Would he be nice and easy to talk to, she won-
dered ; like his letters—open, candid, and yet so
respectful; or would he, as he easily might, take
advantage of her loneliness and the strange posi-
tion in which she was placed? This last possi-
bility came in upon her with a rush and sickened
her. The trees and the ground beneath her feet
swam round and round ; she took a hasty glance
at the clock, and, seeing that there were still two
minutes before the half-hour, she snatched up her
bunch of flowers and dived into the dense scrub
that separated her from the Serpentine. She was
barely out of sight when a.step-a firm, heavy
step —close to her, brought her to a standstill.
She looked up and there, within reach of her
hand, stood her husband, wearing the red carna-
tion.
Then the whole truth came in upon her with a
rush, and with a little scream that had no fear in
it, she fell into her rightful resting place.
MANNINGTON CAFFYN.
Dear Bulletin, — The Colonial Institute
is not without its uses, as a place where members
can make artless confession of the faith that they
have instituted. Sir James Crichton-Browne
whose connection with the kawlinies is somewhat
mysterious and uncertain, has been telling his
bogus Australian friends that, as he casts his eye
across the seas and observes the expansion of
universities in these primitive regions, he can’t ■
help feeling some regret. Regret not so much
because ignorance is always favorable to intense
loyalty, but for the reason that such expansion
may tend to reduce the emigration of young
Australians to Oxford and Cambridge, where they
acquire that “love of England which must j
materially strengthen the bonds,” &c. Crichton- ,
Browne, bless him ! never thinks of looking at
the other side of this great international question.
Why can’t the gilded youth of Great Britain try a
course of education at Sydney or Melbourne
University, and return home with a boundless
affection for Australia and a supreme contempt
for the Institute where it is misrepresented?
A young Australian must be schooled in English
fallacies and saturated with English customs,
ideas, prejudices and snobbery before he can
want any bonds at all, and can swallow
the awkward circumstance that the bonds are a
purely English arrangement which we are con-
tinually exhorted to strengthen at the same old
end—our end.—E. E.
One of the saddest things on record was
the sight of the six editors of the six evening
papers in Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane all
sitting in their offices the other Thursday evening,
and waiting—waiting like six ghouls for theDuke of
Clarence to die —they thought he was going to die,
for he had pneumonia and his temperature was up
to 104. They had six leading articles all written
up and ready, stating that the world was a sombre
blank now that Clarence was dead, and six more
stating that all nature had brightened up since he
had recovered, and yet he wouldn’t either die nr
recover in any definite way. iSo they prowled
round with their articles, and swore be-
cause the prince wouldn’t die in time for the
four o’clock edition ; and sundry other editors
also waited and got their biographies ready, and
prayed that he might hang on till it was too late
for the evening papers and then die just in time
for the morning ones. The morning papers, &c., got
it as they generally do, for most monarchs (being
grateful for the morning paper grovel) die just in
time for the early editions, and Providence makes
up for it and tempers the wind to the shorn
evening paper by giving it the first show’ at the
hangings and floggings instead. The only editors
who were calm amid all the confusion were those
who ran two journals—morning and evening. If
a potentate died at night and a chimney sweep
were hanged in the morning they were ready for a
“ scoop ” in either contingency.

Mrs. Frances Baylor, an American
novelist, complains that there is no ‘‘home life ”in
her country, nowadays, because the wives arealways
shopping, dining-out, or attending publicmeetings.
From wliich it is evident that the fair dame
knows nothing of America outside the big cities.
There was plenty of home life in “ The County
Fair,” for instance.
The editor of Harper’s Weekly has com-
menced to arrest for false pretences those literary
confidence-operators who crib old poems and
stories and endeavour to sell them to him as new
matter. These people are not much more dis-
honest than certain fat proprietors we could name,
who, having refused to buy Australian literary
matter when tendered in original MS., calmly
proceed to steal it, without acknowledgment,
when they find it printed in the English papers.
Pomborneit (Vic.) rabbit-preserving fac-
tory employs 70 hands during the busy season,
and distributes in wages and the purchase of
rabbits about .£400 weekly. With present
facilities and a full staff, 20,000 pairs of rabbits or
8000 sheep can be tinned weekly. The first year
that the factory was opened something like
600,000 rabbits were handled, but not one-sixth of
that number can now be obtained, even over an
increased area. The trappers get fivepence per
pair for all rabbits delivered.
They elected a new Mayor the other day
in Dunedin (M.L.) and when he was safely in his
committee forwarded their little bill. The chair-
man charged £50 for his own services, .£20 for a
secretary, <£6 for an under-secretary, £5 10s. for
clerical assistance, and £113s. for pens, ink, and
stationery. Also, there was a charge for something
like 3800 drinks, and down near the bottom of the
invoice came an unobtrusive memo, which blushed
unseen to this effect: “ Four hats (for bets) £4
4s.” The Mayor refused to pay, and the com-
mittee say that he is a hog and are suing him for
the money.
A gentleman who signs himself “Boiling
Billy," and who states that for the past 25 years
he has only escaped finding work by the special
interposition of Providence, sends us sundry sug-
gestions for a new law code, as follows : —
(1) In time of strike it shall be unlawful for any person
to carry firearms, unless he be a paid-up member of some
labour organisation. Caution: Do not use them un-
necessarily. When you do use them, fire low.
(2) Any person being possessed of property exceeding
£20,000 in value, shall pay £100 per week into the strike
fund while strike continues: exceeding £20,000, such sum
as Mr. W. G. Spence shall direct.
(3) Any person or persons who shall feloniously or
otherwise assault, knock-about, stone, kill, or crush, or
in any way mangle or disembowel any squatter or squat-
ters without just cause, shall be handed over to Mr. \V.
G. Spence to be dealt with as he shall think proper.
(4) Anyone who shall be found guilty of killing another
shall be hanged by the neck till he is dead, dead,
deceased, excepting he shall prove deceased to have been
a scab or blackleg. Men are requested not to burn such
scab’s house or destroy his wife and children without a
special permit.
(6) Government shall supply rations free of charge to
all holders of union tickets.
(6) Any member of the police-force found guilty of
being involved in anv struggle between union men and
scabs shall—failing to prove that he was engaged in pro
tecting union men from bodily violence—be immediately
discharged from the force.
One or two clauses of an unreasonable and blood-
thirsty character have been struck out.
When, after the defeat of Balmaceda’s
people, the revelry in Valparaiso had partially
subsided, the bodies of the two dead Generals were
allowed to lie uncared-for for nearly a week :
Then they were picked up, placed on a rude, four-
wheeled carry-all, and dragged through the streets, being
spat upon and stoned by the infuriated mob. It was a
terrible sight to see the two bodies, stiff in death, the
rigid arm of one of them stretched out almost upright,
being treated in such a hideously uncivilised manner.
Balmaceda knew what he was about when he blew out Ins
brains rather than fall into the hands of these barbarous
wretches. And he was no better than they, for while he
bad powfer he was as ruthless to his enemies as they would
have been to him. He shot and tortured while he was
able, like a true Chileno, and his lieutenants followed his
example, after the custom of the country. A witness
says: “ It is sickening even to pen it; but I saw the mob
in Valparaiso fight for a bone, a hand, a small piece of
flesh, anything, out of the carts containing the bodies of
the Generals. And six officers of the Junta looked on and
smiled.”
A young gentleman from the country
called the other day at the Federal Bank (Melb.)
and asked, in a light and airy, but courteous tone
if he could see the manager. The manager was
visible and shouted, “ Come in !” to the stranger’s
knock. “How d’ye do, Mr. ?” said the
gentlemanly young person with the sun-burnt
face and the'three-months’ beard. “How d’ye
do, sir?" said the manager, rising politely and
pointing’ to a chair, “ take a seat, sir ; and what
can I do for you?’ he added affably, with a
latter-day bank manager’s keen scent for new
customers. “ Well, you don’t seem to know me,
Mr. ?'’ exclaimed the young man with pathos
in his voice. “No,” said the manager, “I con-
fess, sir, that you have the advantage of me. Mai
I enquire—-■?” “Oh, certainly—my name is
Fourdrinier, late teller in this bank, decamped
with fourteen hundred two or three months ago ;
I’ve only called to give myself up " bo it is .
Fourdrinicr ! Very glad to see yon, my boy ;
just touch that bell at your elbow, will you?
“With pleasure.” (Enter Buttons.) Bthd
bert, fetch a policeman,” remarks Mr. , but
the visitor objects—“ Oh, hang it, no ! a hansom :
von can drive with me to the detective office.
I’ve been rubbing shoulders with the d. s down
the Bay and all over tin' blooming place for tlv
last month, and as the money’s all gone they’ll Ik
>dad enough to ram me into ohokey.” Then thej
went out together, Fourdrinicr nodding plea-
santly to his former comrades on the way.

" Since I used the Electric
Hair Curler my hair has
gained in strength and lustre,
and crimps and carls as if by
magic. lam determined tbait
all my friends shall use it.'
Unsolicited testimonials, couched in the most eulogistic terms, have been

i and altogether admirable piece of mechanism.
By its aid the hair, beard, or moustache can be curled in any style in two
[ minutes. It produces any form desired by ladies wearing their hair in the fashion-
able “ loose and fluffy ” mode. A beautiful article; handle of rosewood, other
part nickel-plated.
► Entirely harmless to the hair. Saves time and trouble, and never fails to
curl or crimp in the most graceful, beautiful, and artistic style.
Ladies who wear cWmps, or other forms of false hair, will find the Electric
; Curler an article of the greatest utility. It is simple in its operation, and can be
used by everybody with entire success the first time. It has become indispensable,
and within a short time almost universally adopted by the ladies of England and
; America.

A crank goes about Collins-st. (Mel.)selling

The S.M. Herald, under’ the heading of
“ The Australian Association for the Advance-
ment of Science ” :
Baron Von Mueller, in seconding the motion, said that
the map of Central Australia was being rapidly filled up,
until little would be left to be explored. With the excep-
tion of New Guinea, it was one of the most interesting
and fascinating countries of the world, not merely on
account of its extent of fertile land, and the enormous
height of its mountains, but because of the promises held
out by its hundreds of miles of rocks of an auriferous
character.
This is indeed news !
A veteran of 70 odd years Was the other
day admitted into Sydney Hospital, and put to
bed, with the clear conviction on the part of the
attendants that he would never leave the couch
fexcept feet-first. The previous bath, the titivat-
ing, and the clean sheets, combined to form a
restful haven for the old fellow', who presently
sought to cap his enjoyment by filling his old
clay and puffing away contentedly. “ You
carn’t smoke here! ” broke upon his dream,
like the croak of a crow. “You go to Heligo-
land,” was his prompt retort to the wardsman
who was the offender. “I tell yer, yer carn’t
smoke here.” “But I can, ’cos I am.” The
wardsman fetched the matron, who gently corro-
borated the former’s dictum—“ Smoking is not
allowed in the wards.” “ Ho, it hain't; hain’t it?”
yapped the old fellow, springing out of bed like a
12-year-old, “ then, by ’eavens, I’m going to a
houtside ’orspital, where I can smoke myself black
in the face, and empty me pooch, and cadge
more when I wanter.’* And he dressed himself
and left.
Before the G.N. Railway (N.S.W.) was
extended to the Queensland border Cobb and Co.
had in their employ for many years a coach-
driver who differed so from all other drivers as to
earn for himself the nickname of “Silent Bob.”
A loquacious drummer, on his first trip North,
took his seat on the box of Bob’s coach after the
arrival of the train late at night. When they
were fairly started on their journey over the
Moonbies he began to spin some of his best yarns.
At the end of the first he got half a grunt, half a
growl, instead of the expected laugh. He tried
Bob with another, with even less success. When
the hprses were just crawling along the most dan-
gerous part of the road the jolly bagman produced
the pick of the basket in the line of yarns and fired
it at the driver. Not a sound from the motionless
jehu. • Thinking he had grasped the situation,
the now-alarmed commercial asked, in startled
tones, “Are you asleep, driver—are you asleep?”
Like the blast of a fog-horn the answer came—
“ What the blanky blank would I be doing asleep,
you blanky fool !”

The Theatre Royal Hotel, .Sydney, has
lately changed hands, and is now under entirely
new management. A splendid stock of wines,
spirits, liqueurs and cigars has been laid in, and
an altogether new feature is provided in the shape
of an American bar, where all the strange, curious
and refreshing drinks known in the United States
can be obtained. Their name is legion, but among
them may be mentioned champagne cocktails,
gin fizz, milk punch, mint julep—probably the
noblest liquor known to man—imperial punch.

The late John Probert, of Auckland (M.L.),
was a fair specimen of a mean advertising
religionist. He was a very wealthy man and a
Wesleyan ; and when he was seized with his last
illness the Wesleyan parsons gathered in great
force round his bed, and a Wesleyan lawyer drew
his will, and when he was dead it was found that
the Wesleyan Church had “scooped the pool.”
Then there was the usual outpouring in the press
about the munificent Christian who had departed,
and the dead benefactor was boomed in big black
print because he had hung on to his money like
grim death to the very last, and then had given it
to the Lord, and left an old, broken-down brother
and his wife dead-broke. This vetlerable pair now
