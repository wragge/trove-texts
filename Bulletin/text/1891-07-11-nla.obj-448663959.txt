time to the study of

gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualification?
combined with unswerving faithfulness to hii
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. i lis practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other ciasa of troubles that
afflict mankind.

should send for
Dr. Perry’s Pamphlet on Nervous Diseases;
Their Cause, Symptoms, and Treatment.
This pamphlet is specially written to show a method of
counteracting the ill effects of indiscretions in early life,
over-work, mental worry, &c., and contains a fund of use-
ful information for every sufferer from the following com-
plaints, viz :—Loss of Energy and Will Power, NERVOUS
DEBILITY, Pains in the Back, Defective Memory, Specks
hefore the Eyes, Excessive Nervousness, Premature
Decay, Bashfulness, Excessive Heart Palpitation, Des-
pondency, Impure Blood, Liver and Kidney Complaints,
Contagious Diseases, and various other symptoms experi-
enced by Nervous Sufferers.
This Pamphlet is sent Free on Application,
and all in any way suffering from the above would derive
benefit from the perusal of this work.
If the patient’s case is of long standing, and, therefore
in need of treatment, he should lose no time in writing
me a letter detailing in full his symptoms, on receipt of
which I will at once reply, explaining the nature of his
complaint, and if I can effect a cure, the time it will take,
and the cost of doing so. My long experience in the
treatment of Nervous Diseases has made me thoroughly
conversant with all their peculiarities. I am prepared,
therefore, to
Guarantee a Permanent ami Complete Cure in every case I undertake.
I invite the fullest investigation into my qualifications. For some time I was House Surgeon to the Great
Northern Hospital, London, where I had special opportunities of investigating the causes of Nervous Diseases, and
become perfectly acquainted with the most approved scientific and successful methods of affecting their cure.

Payment of Members and the Labour
Party.
Among the many causes that have contributed
to the success of the Labour-party in the recent
New South Wales elections there are two which
tower high above the others. The Payment of
Members’ Act is one—the other, the lesson
taught by the late strike. Among the enemies
to the Act alluded to, who would gladly repeal
the measure that brought the poor but thought-
ful wage-earner to the front, there has been a
slight simmer of hope, now practically dissi-
pated, that, by the ingenuity or the chicanery
of lawyers, certain words in it might be so
warped as to destroy its intention and restrict
its action in the late Parliament. In construing
or interpreting an Act, the judges, of course,
must be guided by the words before them. If
through intention, or inability, or negligence,
the Legislature chooses to use words ambigu-
ously, that is not the fault of the judges. But
suppose the worst—suppose an authoritative
opinion to be obtained that the Act to remune-
rate members began and ended with the last
Parliament, the capitalistic triumph would be
but short. Another measure, whose provisions
could not be misunderstood, would be at once
passed. Delays might follow. The Upper
House—the very name is droll considering the
persons who squat on its seats—might pause,
dawdle, reject. The Governor even might be
E revailed upon to refuse the creation of a fresh
atch of nominees intended to pass the new
measure. Should he do so he would have to
seek other advisers, and, as they could not be
found, his choice, in the famous words of Gam-
betta towards MacMahon, would lie between
submitting and resigning.
• # •
In Victoria the passing of the Act for re-
munerating members has never yet had the effect
produced by the similar measure in New South
Wales. It has never yet succeeded in creating
a solid labour phalanx with a clearly-defined
policy ; never resulted in returning a block vote
of one-fourth of the representatives pledged to
the workers’ cause, or, in other words, commis-
sioned to make or unmake Governments which
would not lend a willing ear and an active
response to the toilers’ demands. This was
partly by reason of the backward state of prole-
tarian political thought in the southern pro-
vince twenty years ago, and partly, perhaps
mainly, because of the Berrys and other
smell-feasts who gabbled in Melbourne by-
streets, so that they might ultimately grovel in
London boudoirs. In a word, Victorian
Democracy was sold in order that a few of
those flatulent ones who climbed to place and
power over its shoulders might secure ginger-
bread titles and play the congenial part of
harlequins at Courts, where their greasy presence
gave rise to a flutter of fans or a raising of eye-
glasses. It is different with New South Wales.
The uses of adversity are sweet, and in the
late strike which prima-facie ended so badly for
the workman, there was brought home to him
this suggestive fact—so far as his claims were
concerned, freetraders and protectionists were
“much of a muchness.” The so-called pro-
tectionist journals that should have stood by
him, deserted him in his need. Thus the hard-
ship and suffering caused by the strike will n
have been in vain, should they but teach t
artisan and the labourer never again to trus
the individual or the journal that turned up
them in their adversity. Perhaps the drolle
feature of all is that the very broadsheets whic
a year ago lent their little pule in favour o:
Nordenfeldt guns for the suppression of popul
dissatisfaction are the precise ones in this, t
hour of labour’s triumph, to tender unsolicitec
advice as to how the party should condu
itself. Impudence is good and serviceable
its way, but it can be overdone.
# * #
That the principle of remunerating Parli
mentary delegates is not alone theoretical
sound, but practically unassailable, was we
shown during the late N.S.W. politica
struggle, and will become more obvious still
a few weeks when the session begins. The non
producers with either head or hand—the socia
spawn whose office is to eat and digest wha
others grow —are violently disturbed. T 1
idea of seeing a man legislating to-day who, bu
yesterday, was plastering rooms or wheelin
bricks, is to them by no means a pleasant on
Strangely enough, foremost among the mos
violent denouncers of the Labour-party in tl
recent wrangle, are those who have mendec
kettles, pulled beer-engines, and carried hods
days gone by. It cannot be said of them tha
they mended or pulled or carried better tha
their fellows. On the contrary, they wer
generally behindhand in all the physical virtue
involved in pulling or hauling or humping
But they possessed the one inestimable gift o;
parsimony—the gift that, in society as at pre
sent constituted (in spite of the teachings o:
Christ), is more valuable to the possessor tha
all the cardinal virtues welded into one
Strange that, to a person whose early life wa
given to house-painting and decorating, th
fact of another painter becoming a legislate
should be so offensive. By thirty or forty year
of what a few call thrift and the majority stin
the former acquires “a stake in the country
and has no necessity to work for the remainde
of his days. This remainder he would fai
devote to public affairs, having devoted so muc
to himself, and is consequently surprised whe
his ungrateful country says—-“ We’ll have non
of you. If you could not give us the raornin
of your days, when your feelings were as arden
as your cold nature would allow, we decline t
accept your dotage when individual selfishnes
has become a second nature and your onl
object in serving us is a hankering for th
glamour, such as it is, that the position wi
throw round your long life of paltriness. ”
* * *
To politics as to any other profession mei
should take when young. The Tory sneer of
‘ ‘ professional politician ” applies with equa
force to a “professional” actor, musician, sur
geon, lawyer, parson, Avriter, artist, scientist
carpenter, shoemaker, scavenger, or hangman
For that matter, what would have been the New
South Wales politicians for the last thirty year
or more but “professionals,” except that a
their best they never rose beyond clumsy ama
teurism ? Ever since the advent of the quasi
independent system under which Australia
lives our representatives have largely consistec
of men who deprecated payment to member
while privately enriching themselves at the
country’s expense, or of servile sycophants who
pompously assumed that their fair round bellies
and unstinted broadcloth would make their
unkempt English respectable. The very reflec
tion that the men who now deplore the uprising
of the “lower classes ” Avere to be seen in the
House during the last and previous Congresses
spluttering like drunken helots, or gibbering in
the tongue of Mrs. Gamp, is a lesson in
effrontery. Of all persons least calculated to
make beneficent laavs for a community commenc
us to those who by half a century or less ol
successful selfishness have become financially
independent. There is no independence about
them in the best meaning of the word. This
Avhimsical world of ours is alive with shams
but the most egregious sham of all is the tacit
assumption that the person who has been most
successful in hoarding money by means of the
labours of others is the best person to entrust
with public affairs. In the vast majority of
cases, when taken out of the little huckstering
circle in which he sat as spider in the middle
and gobbled the foolish flies that alighted on the
circumference or on the numerous and sticky
radii, he Avill be found a dunce of the purest
Avatsr. The art of governing, of law-making,
has no affinity Avith commercialism, the petty
huckstering faculty.
# * •
Concerning representative Government there
are some things that should never be forgotten,
especially by the New South Wales Avage-
earners who now, for the first time, have made
their power felt. The system of representation
has been a class institution down to this year of
grace, 1891. Men now alive and vigorous saw'
a House of Commons avliosc entire constituents
consisted of 15,000 voters in a population of
30,000,000 —a House more than half of whose
members were nominated by the Peers while
the fractional remainder were sometimes re-
turned by electorates in Avhich the candidate
was either the sole voter or one out of two or
three. Even at the present moment millions of
Englishmen have no more voice in the govern-
ance of their country than the Russian political
convicts have in the affairs of Siberia. There
are four or five labour-candidates in the Com-
mons, it is true, but these in a House of nearly
700 have about as much influence as the Italians
of 1814-15 had regarding the dismemberment of
their country at the Congress of Vienna. And
yet the Sydney journals blab in a flaccid,
sprawling way about the possibility of “class”
legislation in the newly-elected Parliament !
Why, the Commons, which Sir Henry Parkes
extols as the Avorld’s model in the Avay of a
representative institution, is the very home of
class legislation, and Avill continue so till the
British masses are not alone enfranchised, but
politically educated up to the point Avhen a
proletarian majority wdll take over charge of
the army and navy, and when the “stately
homes of England ” will be levelled with the
dust, rather than millions should starve while
thousands of square miles of the choicest land
are given over to deer and grouse. Talk of
class legislation, with such an example as the
British Lower House held up to you for admira-
tion ! Surely the working-men of Australia are
no longer to be choused by such transparent
tomfoolery !
* # •
By the man who earns his living by hand or
head, the portentous fact should never be lost
sight of that, so long as a majority of a legisla-
ture is composed of idlers, drones, fribbles, or
even men in easy circumstances, advance in the
proper direction will be blocked. The rich have
ever had legislatures in their power since the
dawn of constitutional government under the
Plantagenet Henry 111. The results are to
be seen on every hand. Over against a
sybaritism, unknown since marauding pro-
consuls entered Rome with the spoils of a
province in their train, is to be seen abjectness,
to which that of the Jews under Pharoah was
luxury. Yet the English professor, Thorold
Rogers, who devoted the best part of a life
to the subject, assures the world that, in the
14th and 15th centuries, there was a fowl in
every Briton’s pot, not on Sundays alone, but
all the week through. What extracted the
fowl and turned the husbandman out to starve on
the road-side, to be sold into slavery, branded
and whipped for his first attempt to escape, and
hanged for his second or third ? Nothing but
the class legislation of Tudor and Stuart
Parliaments, a legislation which, in a somewhat
modified form, is carried on in Britain to this
day. And yet, forsooth, the frowsy Sydney
press takes upon itself to lecture the Australian
labour representative on how he should com-
port himself ! It is time the poor got not only
a fourth but three-fourths of the legislative
power. It is no more than their numbers will
eventually give them should they not be weak-
kneed enough to be cajoled by what a W est Sydney
member not inappropriately called the “ pot-
hatted ” section of the community. That they
would use such an accession of power with more
temperance and justice than was ever meted to
them in the days of their weakness and dis-
organisation is as certain as that their regime,
would herald an era of true prosperity hitherto
unknown. There would be an occasional temp-
tation, no doubt, to order out the artillery and
troopers to prevent men in frock-coats from
crowding at Circular Quay, but it is improbable
that the cavalry would be permitted to draw
swords or the gunners supplied with anything
beyond blank ammunition. Indeed, no special
object would be attained by firing ball-cartridge.
For the Ministers who are sufficiently thick-
skinned to retain office in the present state
of parties could afford to laugh at an ordinary
sabre-cut or rifle bullet.
* * *
In view of the near approach of Federation
and the later advent of an Australian Republic,
one and indivisible, the Labour-party did well
to banish the fiscal question from its platform.
A split on the subject would have been inevit-
able, and considering the questions of equal or
greater moment pressing for an immediate solu-
tion, such a split at the outset would have been
deplorable. Besides, when provincial amalga-
mation arrives, Protection will not be far
behind. The latter, indeed, is a corollary of
the former. Again, while from our standpoint
free foreign-trade is as suicidal for an un-
federated New South Wales as it would be for
a federated Australia, we have never challenged
the fact that a country may bo so situated
as to make unrestricted commerce a necessity.
What we have denied strenuously is that the
commercial doctrines of the Manchester school
were as inexpugnable as a geometrical axiom—
were applicable to all countries, however geo-
graphically placed or commercially developed.
But without wilfully shutting one’s eyes, it is
idle to deny that penury of the same kind, if
not to the same degree, may exist in countries
whose fiscal systems differ widely. If the
squalor of protected Paris or New York is not
so widespread or abject as that of partially-
protected London (the world contains no really
Freetrade State), still it exists. This shows
that the causes of poverty lie at depths rarely
reached by foreign-trade or by protective plum-
mets. So far as Australasia is concerned, our
contention has always been, not that Protection
was a specific for social ills, but that it was a
palliative, or a move in the right direction. For
the Labour-party, then, to divide at the outset
and thus disfranchise itself over a minor affair
while momentous abuses are crying for redress
would be merely following in the footsteps
of the Irish chiefs Avho broke each other’s
heads for the love of Christ while the Nor-
man or Anglo-Saxon cut-throats were behind
the hill waiting to finish the job which the
foolish Celts had begun. One thing is certain—
nothing would be sweeter in the nostrils of
Sydney politicians and editors than the scent
of a free-light amongst the working-men’s
delegates. Thucydides ! as Mr. Daniel
O’Connor would say, how gaily the intelligent
persons on both sides of the Speaker, as well as
the f riends of the working-man at the heads of
the Sydney dailies, would sidle up with bottles
and sponges and press the combatants to fight
to a finish !
• * *
From a variety of causes then, the conflict
through which New South Wales has just
passed has been the first of its kind in the
Australasian colonies. It is probable that it
would not have occur red at all but for the provision
for remunerating members, wisely made by the
last Parliament. From all men of liberal minds,
men who see in Democracy one of the chief
methods by which the scandalous inequalities of
existing society may ultimately be assuaged or
destroyed, the late triumph has received a
hearty welcome. Not so from those whose lives
and thoughts are but a standing protest against
God for making such a mistake as to disturb
chaos by creating the world. Such persons
believe in a society of infinite gradations with
them on top rosy-gilled and daintily clad. They
believe, or affect to believe, that a person has a
perfect right to do as he likes with what is
called “ his own,” whether the latter consist of
houses or lands, of mountain, river, or sea-
coast. By the fair name of ‘ ‘ freedom of con-
tract ” they dignify the gaunt necessity that
ends in the sweating-room and the pauper’s
coffin. To creatures who see in the miseries
of the poor nothing but the working of an
inexorable law the result of the elections has
come as a shock. Still, it is but a gentle
lullaby compared with what will follow.
When education was left to the caprice of
parents, or letter-carrying to the whims of in-
dividuals the community increased in ignorance
while the chances of letters reaching their des-
tination decreased. It will be for the new
delegates to show that State interference must
be immensely extended in various directions
until gradually men come to see that they are
members of one family, that the adventitious
distinctions sought to be set up between them
for ages are no real distinctions at all, and that
the only true measures of a personal worth are
character and knowledge.
A Programme for the Labour Party.
Foe. many years—indeed, for many centuries—
the perpetual watchword of the prudent poli-
tician has been to “Go slow.” There has been
much drivel about the insertion of the “ thin
end of the ivedge; ” much solemn bosh con-
cerning the necessity for weighing all measures
of reform carefully in the balance; much
painful bogwash about the desirability of avoid-
ing velocity lest it should savour of revolution.
The only thing that the average politician does
suddenly is to suddenly remain where he was
before, and not move. When a great evil is
discovered—or rather when an evil that was
discovered in the days of the Roman Uesars
becomes more than usually pressing—the
orthodox proceeding of the orthodox kind of
Liberal statesman is to acknowledge that the
evil is one that urgently demands a remedy, and
to beseech the country to lie low lest it should
give way to “revolutionary legislation.” Then
he hangs fire for 25 years while still admitting
the extreme urgency of the case, and mean-
while his opponents complain of his indecent
rapidity, and the country is so used to this sort
of thing that it really mistakes it for haste.
By and bye a small, feeble, half-hearted measure
of reform comes before a Legislature, for no
orthodox statesman ever brings in the whole
reform at once ; and it is bounced out by the
Opposition which—under the grand old principle
of Government by Contradiction—is bound to
object even to its own theories when the
Ministry supports them. The country can’t
complain of this, for it hires the Opposition for
this purpose, and no other. Finally, after
weary years of contradiction, the scheme
escapes from the Opposition, and then it is
thrown out by the Upper House instead. The
country can’t reasonably complain of this either,
for it keeps the Upper House going for no other
purpose. The whole scheme has only one
merit —it makes things go slow—so hideously
slow, that the Legislature is even yet just
beginning to think that some day, when it is
quite rested, it may possibly get up and tinker
with measures that were found to be essential
away back in the Middle Ages. And the only
difficulty that stands in the way is the fear of
revolutionary haste—the fear that things have
not yet gone slow enough, and that some
more profound consideration is still required.
» * *
In this respect more than any other, the Aus-
tralian Labour Party differs from all the parties
that have gone before it. It means to go fast.
Apart from this fact, there is really little differ-
ence between it and the other parties in Aus-
tralian politics. The Orthodox “moderate”
politician—the individual who is vaguely de-
scribed as a “right-minded person”.— accepts
the labour programme in a vague, theoretical
way. but he wants to be so unspeakably gradual
in his movements that 10,000 years would not see
it much nearer accomplishment. The ortho-
dox Conservative politician also looks forward
to the ultimate realisation of the same projects,
yet he wants to be a good deal more gradual
still. But the working class has grown tired of
this old, prehistoric drivel. It is weary of
wanting a house and receiving a post-dated
promise of a brick. It recognises that Time
travels fast, and that nations do not last long, and
that any good that is to be got out of this world
had better be got now, else the globe may burst
up, and the solar system collapse, and all things
come to an end, before progress has got fairly
started. It realises that, so long as it travels
in the right direction, it can’t go too rapidly,
for the object of all progress is to get some-
where, and the only known way to get there is
to keep moving. It has lived for years on that
tough, unsatisfactory thing known as the thin
end of the wedge, and it has found the thin end
of the wedge to be an unsubstantial article of
diet, and very much devoid of gravy. And
whereas, in the past, it has supported such poli-
ticians as Parkes, and Griffith and Robert
Stout, because they promised to do something
for it and never did anything, it now proposes
to do something for itself instead, and conse-
quently Parkes and Griffith are as super-
fluous as the leaves of last autumn, and the
party of Labour declines to act as their adver-
tisement any longer. So far, it may be, this
new force hardly knows where it is tending, or
how far it is likely to go, but its path is maxked
out for it, and it must follow it.
* * #
In the first place, the Labour party is on the
road to Independence. Willingly or unwillingly,
it must raise the standard of the Australian
Republic. The “Federation under the Crown”
will be stillborn after all, and the chief use of
the Federal Parliament, as planned out by the
Convention—if that Federal Parliament ever
exists at all—will be to furnish a convenient
central battlefield on which the question ni
Monarchy versus Commonwealth can be settled.
It will be a suitable place for the old loyalism
to die in, and a handy sepulchre ready for its
interment. And sooner or later the new party
must declare definitely for Protection against
the outer world, for the sufficient reason that
Labour cannot live by unloading nigger-manned
ships at Circular Quay, or by constructing un-
profitable public works with borrowed money,
or by competing with the cheap Chinaman or
the low-priced Hindoo on a system whereby
only the cheapest survives. The Labour-party
has already committed itself to a certain
measure of Protection—it has demanded that
Australia should be protected against the
Chinaman, and the inexorable logic of necessity
will keep it moving onward in the same direo-


It does take nine tailors to make a man :
one to measure him, one to make the clothes, seven
to collect the bill.
Concerning the ever-recurring farce of
testing, in the witness-box, ability to understand
the nature of an oath in the case of an infant, or
a blackfellow, or a Chinaman, or a J.P., Dis-
trict Court Judge Paul, of Queensland, the other
day remarked that it would be far better to in-
struct and to catechise witnesses about statutory
punishments than about hell-fire and other ini-
aginai y things. The average blackfellow's answer
as to the consequences of his telling a lie on oath
is —“ Mine go to Hell! ” with a big accent on the
last word. “ Where’s hell?” the Court asks —just
as if the Court itself knew! —and Jackey promptly
replies, “ Longa plully lock-up, my word ! ”
Ition. Presently it will also demand Protection
against the cheap human scum from the
Mediterranean and the paupers of all nations—
against every form of labour and the produce of
labour, in fact, that is imported by capital for
ithe purpose of reducing wages. In short, it
will demand the largest, widest, and most com-
prehensive form of Protection on record. If it
■does not, themthere will presently be no Labour-
party at all,' and the movement will die of
internal atrophy. And next it will legislate for
the protection of Australia from the absentee
capitalist, who is, if possible, a shade more
costly and more injurious than the imported
blackleg, inasmuch as his connection with this
country consists chiefly in buying land for an
invisible trifle per acre, in blocking settlement
while he holds it, and contributing nothing
whatever to the revenue, in getting it improved
out of loan-moneys, and then in selling it back
to the nation at an enormous price and taking
away the proceeds.
# * *
Now that Labour has become a genuine
power in politics the much-promised, much-
postponed One-Man-One-Vote principle is at
fast in sight. Above all others, this is the sort
of measure concerning which the standard
politician loves to go slow. He loves to use it
as a war-whoop in a long series of elections,
and to keep in power for years on the strength
of it, but he does not love to see it become law,
for then the war-whoop is used up, and he can-
not grind his axe upon the old shibboleth any
longer. But the Labour-party cares not one
straw though all the old hereditary barnacles of
politics are stranded for want of a war-cry, and
never get afloat any more ; and the capitalistic
plural vote is doomed. And—whether the
party has fully recognised the fact or not —the
old male monopoly of the suffrage is doomed
also, and political power must be extended to
both sexes upon equal terms. The one ruinous
blot upon the whole system of Government by
Capital is that Capital has never cared for any-
thing except its own interests ; the blot upon
Government by manhood suffrage is that the
male democracy has never attended seriously to
anything beyond its own direct interests either.
But if the Labour-party does not remedy this old
injustice it will presently find that the old Con-
servative faction will take up the question, and
will thereby be in a position to taunt the demo-
cracy itself for its conservatism, and to rebuild
some, at least, of its lost influence by passing
itself off as the new party of progress and en-
lightenment.
s * #
The enforcement by law of the eight-hour
system is naturally an essential feature of the
Labour programme, and should that prove in-
sufficient to meet the requirements of the
nation, a seven-hours’ system must be enforced
in its place ; failing even that, a six-hours’
system must do instead. For it is a self-evident
axiom that there should be work enough in the
community for all—that one million consumers
should furnish sufficient employment for one
million producers; and the existence of an
“ unemployed ” population is sufficient evidence
that some section of the nation is doing more
than its share of work, and thus leaving another
section with no occupation. Consequently the
hours of labour can only find their level
when the unemployed difficulty is extinct,
This is the first step towards the abolition
of poverty ; the next is the nationalisation of
land and the abolition of landlordism, with all
its evil concomitants of booms and syndicates,
foreign speculators, absentee proprietorship and
public ruin ; the establishment of a national
system of compulsory insurance ; the abolition
of public borrowing, which is merely absentee
proprietorship in an extended and aggravated
form ; the creation of a State Bank of issue
which would supersede to a great extent the
existing institutions that are so largely run for
the benefit of British stockholders ; and the en-
couragement of Co-operation as a substitute for
the individual employer who has been tried for
so many years and has proved so bad a failure.
* # *
Unfortunately, the present system of Parlia-
mentary chaos makes any serious reform almost
impracticable. The policy of Government by
Contradiction must go, for the arrangement
whereby the country hires one set of men to
carry out its wishes and another set to prevent
them doing it is too cumbersome and too super-
latively idiotic to be of much use. The Upper
House must go, for it is absurd to maintain the
theory of representative institutions when the
will of the people can be overruled by an
irresponsible gang of aged capitalists most of
whom were nominated by other capitalists for
reasons which will not bear inspection. The
gubernatorial veto must go also, for there is no
hope or possibility of reform when the fixed
resolve of the whole nation can be set at naught
by a foreign nonentity, in whose eyes the policy
of the Labour party is one-half blasphemy and
one-half revolution. The present system of
election needs to be formed on the French model,
so that the members returned must represent
an absolute majority of the electors, instead of
representing only the dishonest advantage
gained by a judicious splitting of the enemy’s
vote through the agency of bogus candidates.
And lastly, all questions of serious importance
must be settled by a direct vote of the people
after the manner of the Swiss Referendum ,
instead of being wi’ecked amid the -chaos of a
general when twenty political ques-
tions are mixed up together in inextricable con-
fusion, and not one of them is answered.
« # *
These are the things which Labour mostly
wants, or which it will want when it becomes
an organised force in all the Legislatures of
Australia. It demands a Federal Republic,
Protection against all the world outside this
continent and immediately adjacent islands,
the nationalisation of land, and the aboli-
tion of landlordism in all its branches, and
the government of the people by the people and
for the people in its widest sense, by the estab-
lishment of a system wherein every adult in-
habitant will have an equal voice in public
affairs. It wants to wipe out the great art and
swindle of politics, by taking the direct vote of
the whole people on all important questions ;
it wants no imported Governors nor Borrowed
generals nor hollow military pomp, no foreign
titles nor foreign capitalists, and no more foreign
loans, no cheap labour nor low-priced and
diseased emigrants from the slums of Europe
and Asia, no more religious feuds, no National
Anthem nor similar doggerel, no Upper House,
and no more party Government. It wants co-
operation in place of capitalism, national in-
surance instead of relief works and benevolent
asylums, a universal eight hours’ system, and
various other things of greater or less im-
portance, which will probably be heard of later
on. This, no doubt, is a long and numerous
programme, but it has been accumulating for
5000 years or more, and there are a good many
arrears to get up in consequence. They have
been gathering through all the ages, while pro-
fessional politicians were getting in the thin
end of that wedge which never seemed to get
in any further or any faster, and while pro-
fessional reformers were wailing about the
necessity for preserving the ancient landmarks
of the constitution ; and they have been accu-
mulating ever since the first old, useless public
fossil involuntarily voided the great idea of
going slow, and avoiding revolutionary tenden-
cies. And as that was a very, very long time
ago, when the world was still young, and the
Father of Lies was yet in his infancy, the
accumulated bill which Labour has to present
for settlement has grown somewhat formidable
in the interval.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Move On.
The accused was discharged upon his promise to leave
at once for Sydney.— Item from the Melbourne Age.
The prisoner had undergone two previous sentences for
vagrancy, bub on promising to quit the colony imme-
diately he was released with a caution.— Evening News
Item.
Prisoner was an old offender, but upon his undertaking
to quit Brisbane at once for New South Wales he was
allowed to go .—Item from Brisbane Courier.
The law of imprisonment, regarded as a cure
for crime, is admittedly a failure. It doesn’t
reform the criminal, for the same old batch of
offenders have a perpetual lease of the prisons,
and keep on inhabiting them till they die, and
another batch grows up to take their place.
And it doesn’t extirpate the criminal, for life is
tolerably healthy inside a gaol, and the food is
good, and the air salubrious, and consequently
the old offenders are a long-lived race, and last
till they reach a bad old age. The only logical
alternatives in the case are either to cure the
convict, if his moral disease is curable, or to
extirpate him, when his disease has proved
itself incurable ; but the law doesn’t know how
to do the one, and it lacks the courage or the
consistency to do the other. Consequently the
whole system, so far as the hardened criminal
is concerned, is a makeshift that answers no
visible purpose whatever. When the ancient
and hopeless drunk is “sent up” for the hun-
dredth time or so, nobody expects that he will
be improved by the experience—he is merely
sent up to get him out of the road for the time
being. He isn’t lodged in gaol as a remedy,
for his case is obviously past remedy ; neither
is he deposited there as a punishment, for,
as a rule, he rather likes being there—he is
simply despatched to prison because it is the
correct and orthodox thing to do, and the law
doesn’t know how to do anything else. But
now and then it appears that the old-established
“drunk” has grown tired of one particular
gaol, and has become weary of appearing
before the same old “beak,” and fitting his
chin into the spikes at the same old dock, and
then he generally promises to go and be a
nuisance in some other province for a change,
and, as a rule, he is released on the strength of
that assurance. Possibly it makes the Bench
feel better, and affords it a little pleasant
variety when it is enabled thus to swap drunks
with the Bench in the next capital, for even a
magistrate must feel weary of always sending
up the same band of frowsy wrecks year after
year, and would gladly get a few new outcasts
for a change. Possibly there is a faint hope in
the legal mind that if the vagrant is thus moved
on from Adelaide to Melbourne, and from Mel-
bourne to Sydney, and from Sydney to Brisbane,
and from Brisbane away up into the Far North,
and then is moved right back again till he
brings up once more in lus old haunts, he may
ultimately wear out on the road—that he may
be walked to death, or may founder at sea, or
be otherwise disposed of. Again, it may
be that the Law entertains a joyous delu-
sion that the fresh air, and the scenery
and the laughing-jackasses and other works
of Nature, may move the soul of the
sneak-thief, and strike a sympathetic chord in
the individual who has no visible means of sup-
port ; and that they may burst into tears and
become reformed characters. Or—more pro-
bable still—each P.M. wants to clear his own
particular city of its bad characters and doesn’t
care a single cent, for the feelings of the people
in the next city ; in other words, he throws his
garbage into the next man’s garden, and the
only reason why he never gets to the end of the
process is that the next man is shovelling gar-
bage just as violently as he is, and with exactly
the same end in view. Or—and this is the most
reasonable solution of all—he does it for no
particular reason at all, only he knows that he
is a failure, and the Law is a failure, and the
prisoner is the worst failure of the lot, and
therefore his one desire is to shift the responsi-
bility, and pass on the blame, and let the whole
thing slide.
A New Way to Make Railways.
Here are a few Bulletin ideas for railway
construction in the country districts. First of
all, begin by estimating the increased value
that will be given to lands in the vicinity, and
charge the proprietors, say, three-fourths of the
amount —that will pay for all the land wanted
and leave a good deal over. Don’t fence the
line—if any darned fool gets on it and the
engine walks over him it is his own look-out,
and if anybody’s cows or pigs insist on sleeping
on the line let them be squashed by the cow-
catcher and don’t pay compensation—the owner
ought to have fenced them in. Don’t have any
wayside stations ; simply put up a board with
the name of the place on it; and have no plat-
forms—any reasonably athletic person can shin
up into a carriage without one, and the cripples
can get a leg up from some good Samaritan in
the train. Have no station-master nor porter nor
ticket-seller—the guard who travels with the
train can do all that; and dispense with gate-
keepers in the country districts —the man who
can’t get across the line without being dry-
nursed by a gate-keeper might as well be dead,
anyhow. Have all the rails, locomotives, and
the like made in the country, and have all the
formation of the line done by day-labour ; and
pay for them both in notes issued by a State
Bank. Then, when the railway is finished, the
chances are that there will be some cash left on
hand, for only about half the amount extracted
from the local proprietors on the betterment
principle will have been used to purchase land,
and the other half will be left. This amount
could be used to reduce the public debt. The
notes issued to pay for construction would be
redeemed gradually out of profits—as soon as
there were any profits. Any locality that
began to pine after a railway-station could have
one—the amount to be paid out of the local
rates. Have only one class of carriages—the
trams manage to pull through on that basis,
and the trains can do the same. Then raise
Cain generally and go right ahead.
V The “Deep-toned Aye.”
Dear Bulletin, The present New South
Wales Parliament was elected because Parkes
wanted the country to give a “deep-toned
Aye ” on the subject of Federation, and accord-
ing to the broken-down fool of a constitution,
the only way that the country could do it was
to hold a general election. The result is rather
amusing when you figure it out carefully. Part
of the new House consists of Parkes’ Freetrade
party, which professes to support Freetrade and
Federation at the same time, regardless of the
fact that one of these principles must kill the
other, and that the party might as well try to
chew boiling ice and travel north-east by south.
Another section supports Freetrade without
Federation, and each of these claims to be the
only original and genuine Freetrade party, and
declares the other to be a degraded imitation.
Part of the direct Opposition wants Protection
with Federation, and part of it wants Protection
without Federation, and each of these declares
that it is the only genuine and all-wool Opposi-
tion, and that the other alleged Opposition is
shoddy and a delusion. Then, as to the Labour
party, part of it wants Freetrade and
the other part wants Protection ; also some of
it wants Freetrade with Federation, and some
more of it wants Freetrade without Federation;
likewise one sub-division wants Federation and
Protection, and the other sub-division wants
Protection and no Federation. To sum the
situation up in a general way, one-third of the
country has given its decision on the Labour
question because it considered it to be the most
important, and has virtually let the tariff and
the Federation problem go. A good deal less
than another third has given its vote on Federa-
tion and has let the tariff and the Labour ques-
tion drop altogether. And rather more than a
third has decided on the tariff question, and has
left Labour and Federation to slide igno-
miniously. The general result of all this may
be arrived at pretty well by adding one mile
three furlongs to £2 7s. 6U1., and then dividing
the result by 3cwt. 2qrs. I7lbs. The country
can’t give a decision by the electoral process on
more than one question at a time, and when
there are at least three burning questions to be
considered at once they get so badly mixed up
that there is no definite result about any of
them. The only way to find out whether the
nation wants Federation or not is to take a
popular vote on that subject alone; by the
present method the Federal question is about
eighteen times more hazy than it was when it
first started.—Yours as usual, Titus Salt.
Who Are “The People?”
Both the Sydney morning dailies, recognised
organs of capital, and slaves bound to the
chariot-wheels of their demigod, Parkes, are
undercutting each other in the bid for the
Parliamentary Labour-party’s support. Violent
loves, when suddenly conceived, are usually
vicious, and these greasy monopolistic advances
to Labour deserve no sentiment but the con-
queror’s scorn. The S.M. Herald (which
prints and issues from under its roof an evening-
paper that loses no opportunity of insinuating
that the Labour-members are unwashed ruffians
and unscrupulous loafers who live on the
ignorance and credulity of their brother men)
even in its abject whining, cannot divest itself
of the errors due to its training and class-
arrogating traditions;—
And the members of the Labour-party are the more
bound to recognise this general responsibility since it is
well known that they received a great deal of the support
which placed them where they are from outside tho
ranks of unionism and even of labour. They have re-
ceived generous and sympathetic assistance from the
people, and theymust be aware that after the first sense
of surprise was overpassed, they have received general
and cordial greeting upon their success. They are not
looked upon as anarchists and revolutionists, but as men
who come to Parliament to give direct representation to
a section of the community which has not been satisfied
with its representation in the past.
What a climb-down ! But yesterday, and the
Labour leaders were pilloried in the morning
press (as they are still being pilloried in the
Herald’s Echo) as “ anarchists and revolu-
tionists ” —as dangerous agitators to be dra-
gooned and gaoled ; now they are highly
desirable parliamentarians. Labour might have
grovelled and begged to monopoly for years
without making any impression upon the brass
bosom of its unsleeping enemy. Its fierce
revolt and its subsequent ballot-box victory
have wrung acknowledgments from the throats
of cowed foes, who would never have been
generous enough to grant justice for justice’s
sake. Yet, even in this piteous appeal to the
triumphant cause, the S.M.H. has the gall to
tell Labour that it has * ‘ received generous and
sympathetic assistance from Ihe people.''' Who,
let us ask, are “the people” in the Herald’s
estimation? The handful of capitalists? The
few dozens of squatters ? Tho city ring of
importers? The awkward squad of money-
changers and brokers? Bah ! Labour is “ the
people.” It has “received generous and sym-
pathetic assistance from ” —itself !
Munro and the Women.
Munro has repented of his scheme for granting
the suffrage to female ratepayers only, and has
started afresli on a more democratic basis. He
has drawn up a Bill of eleven short clauses —
the whole thing being about the size of one
sheet of notepaper—in which he sets up three
propositions in single file for the consideration
of the Victorian Parliament. The first asserts
briefly that every man shall have one vote and
one only ; the second, that every woman shall
have the same; the third, that any man or
woman attempting to vote more than once at
any one election shall get into trouble. The
whole affair is short, business-like, and ener-
getic, and for that very reason The Bulletin
is driven to the conclusion that Munro isn’t a
politician. Parkes is. If Parkes had such a
scheme on hand, and had absolutely nothing
else to travel on, lie would have got through
two elections on the strength of it—he would
have stumped the country on it, and dragged
his lame leg through the length and breadth of
New South Wales, and slopped over into the
adjacent provinces—he would have told eyery-
body that he was old and sorrowful, and wanted
to die, but that he would perish standing up
with the pump-handle of the State clutched in
his frozen grasp rather than let this great
reform slide—he would have looked, in fact,
like a giant who was breaking his back to hold
up a pin, and tho country would have taken it
all in. Munro has thrown away a big adver-
tisement this time ; if he had even hired a poet
and a brass band, and laid in a barrel of fire-
works it would have been better than nothing.
Also, he has made an ass of himself on a small
side issue, by giving women a vote at elections
for the Legislative Assembly only, instead of
going the whole hog at once. ' The old super-
stition about getting in “thethin end of the
wedge ” couldn’t be shaken off. It has become
such a fixed conviction that political sagacity
consists in removing one-half of an evil and
leaving the other haft standing that the average
statesman only washes one ear at a time, lest
washing them both should be revolutionary,
and should overset some great landmark of the
Constitution.

A Snag Ahead.
The snag ahead for the New South Wales
Labour-party is the Upper House, and it will
require much vigorous navigation to get round
that obstacle. For several years past the
Assembly lias been growing more and more
liberal in its tendencies, and the old bigoted
fossils who were thrown out at each successive
election have been translated to the nominee
mummy chamber, so that the progressive ten-
dencies of the nation have made things in some
respects a trifle worse than they were before.
Through the amazing bull-headedness of the
cornstalk Constitution it has come to pass that,
when a legislator is too dense or too narrow-
minded or too infamously selfish to be endurable
even for three years, the country gets that same
legislator for the term of his natural life instead;
and this method of improving things by making
them worse is going to create trouble. The
Upper House has made very little noise in the
past, because the Assembly has never trodden
seriously upon its old hereditary corns, but
now things are changed—there are 16 planks in
the Labour platform, and each one of them
will fall heavily on the Council’s bunions,
and rouse it to furious opposition. There-
fore, even though the Labour-party should
secure the assistance of one of the other
parties in the Assembly, and rush every
separate item of its programme through
in triumph, it will be no further advanced than
it is now—the Labour-party in Maoriland
passed about six progressive measures last
session, and the Council dropped them all softly
into the dust-bin, and the same experience will
happen over again in Sydney. The one alterna-
tive is to send to the Council a batch of demo-
cratic nominees sufficient to carry through the
popular programme; and then promptly pass a
measure, with their assistance, either abolishing
the nominee House or turning it into an elec-
tive body. It is necessary to get the new batch
of nominees in early, for until they are in it is
almost hopeless to waste time on the One-Man-
One-Vote Bill, or any other such measure—the
present Council would simply sell the document
for waste paper, and all the enthusiasm of the
Assembly would be so much lost material.
And, having got the new nominees in, it is
advisable to get a Reform Bill through with all
speed, for even an advanced democrat cannot
be trusted long with irresponsible power, and
in less than twelve months the new members
would probably have fallen in love with the
system which gave them a life-long billet apiece,
and would be disinclined for a change. There-
fore the Labour-party would do well to look to
this matter, and if any Premier or prospective
Premier is willing to swallow the Labour pro-
gramme whole in return for the support of the
democratic members, they can test his sincerity
by demanding the appointment of a body of
democrats to the Upper House, sufficient to
prevent the hopeless wreck of their projects in
that legislative sepulchre. And if Parkes or
Dibbs, or- the other individual, whoever he may
be, declines this condition, the party may
safely conclude that he means to get his name
up as a reformer by booming every imaginable
reform in the Assembly, and then to whoop
round as a patriotic martyr when the Council
blocks him by pre-arrangement, and leaves
things just as they were before.

Mv i)BAtt MOORABINUAi—
That uiuch-talked-of Sydney engagement—both parties
t 6 which circulated ill legal dircles—is now declared off;
The gentleman is the alleged culprit, hut the lady is to be
cdngtatulated bn her spirit iii breaking the rosy chains
directly she detected an icy expression in his eye. 1 knoW
one young lady (she ultimately altar’d her victim) to
whom her fiancee contritely and honestly confessed that
lib had fallen in love with another woman, of course
expecting an indignant dismissal Hut, with a martyr
like expression; She sithply put her Octopean arms
around his ndck and remarked, in* a choked voice l
“Gteorge, this is a dreadful sorrow, hut u'6 must ended•

action about him, they did bear it —and are bearing it
still,
Sitting in ller Majesty’s stalls at the auction of seats
for the Bernhardt premiere, 1 couldn’t help grinning at
the odd capers some of the buyers cut. One funny little
man, holding an eye-glass at arm’s length, came on to the
Stage and actually danced before the plan—id his anxiety
about the latitude of his places, I suppose—and a fnan
arose in a distant part of the stalls and vaguely told the
auctioneer, with great gesticulation, that he wanted
‘ two seats—there—behind you,” although the whole
diagram of the house was in that predicament 1 There
were a few ladies in the stalls, but I saw only one society
dame, and altogether the auction, despite the theatrical
appearance of Handsome George in the d.c. giving orders
j-n a Henry Vee voice, fell rather flat so far as excitement
went. A lew silly youths thought it screaming fun to bid
fancy prices and then duck behind chairs when the ham-
mer came down.
The-large and speckled throng at the fourth Halle con.
cert on the last day of June, was stirred to its deepest
over the inspired rendering, by Mdlle. Filliinger, of
Gounod’s-“ Ave Maria” (with the inestimable advantage
of a violin obligato by Lady H,), which musical triumph
was quite the emotional feature of the programme.
Several people were observed wiping a dewy tear from
their eyes when she had finished, and the fact that the
lady vocalizsd strictly in Latin and yet moved the crowd
so, goes a long way to prove that “hearing the words”
has nothing to do with the success of a melodious song,
although most people make such a bugbear of “ articula-
tion.” Sir Charles Hall6—who was last on the bill at this
concert,, a wonderful concession for a “ star ’’—was sooth-
ing and tearful in the Sonata Pathetique, and Lady Hall 6
“got there,” as the incorrigible little boys say, with both
her satin-shod feet in the fantasia on “ Der Freyschtitz,”
which was, like everything else,, vigorously encored.
There wasn t much gowning in the hall. 1 only saw an
Oriental cloak in red and gold, with- yoke and high collar
in red silk, worn, by a society-woman, but on the stage
everything was radiant as usual. Lady Hal 16 wore a gown
in. white brocade, made with panels edged with gold pom-
poms, over a skirt of white net edged with gold-bullion
braid, which also trimmed the bodice; diamond ornar
ments. Mdlle Filliinger also in. white brocade trimmed
with white jet; Madame Burton (the same favourite as in
“Paul Jones”) in a crimson silk gown figured; in black
and,trimmed with fringe and lace.
The fifth Halid shriek on 2nd inst., though tip-top in.
strumentally, was not so soothing vocally as the one that
went before—there seemed to be a kink in Filliinger’s top
0, and Burton’s way of taking breath suggested that she
had just run up a hill. However, Lady Halid was in
inspired form and played'.a Mendelssohn concerto straight
from, her soul, though the large and attentive audience
liked the racy “St. Patrick’s Day ” by far the best, Jndg,
mg from,the applause, which showed how the great artiste
has only to tickle the classical Sydneyite with “Hoopde
doodendo ” to, see how deep the culchaw goes and what
honestly fetches Them ! The Grieg sonata (illustrative of
a Southern lovp-scene—certainly some of the fiddle pas-
sages sounded like tickling) didn’t reach the house, who
only gave it a “complimentary.” hand, but the tuneful
ballad in A- flat (“Chopang”), played-by Sir Charles
“Hall” (as a lady read him,off the card), was rapturously
received, though it.was the last number. Madame Burton
wore the handsomest stage dress on this occasion—a white,
sijk gown ,with the skirt, embroidered all over the front in
akind of,octopus design in gold and coloured threads*,
jewels and spangles ; the array of brooches on the cor-
sage, however, was quite reminiscent of a, jeweller’s
window. Lady Hall 6 didn’t look her best in a black gown
trimmed with jet, diamond brooches; somebody should
tell Lp Filliinger, who frocks herself .in, too haphazard a
style for a nation educated up to the standard of “ Worth,
of Paris,” that a more careful coiffure and a tighter fit in—
hem, her—diaphragm support would greatly enhance her
unadorned Austrian artlessness.
Vice-regal day at the sheep-show, at the uncomeatable
Sydney Agricultural Ground, on 3rd inst., was attended
by a vast crowd of hayseeds, and a few of those female
enthusiasts who would rush blindly into Tophet if they
thought Lady J. would be there—which, I am sure, sh ( -
never will. But only the noble Earl and Mr. Goschen in a
red Tom Thumb tie turned up, and as they, though as good
as gold up to date, aren’t much to look at, there \va i+
nothing for it but to criticise the baa-baas. In the-
pavilion the Tasmanian sheep had the thickest and
deepest wool, and they certainly looked the best from a
shearer’s point of view, of all the exhibits, but I preferred
the artistic, if less accredited Southdovvns with their
spindle-spidery legs and their pretty though shoddy
fleece. However, on my explaining my purely aesthetic
preference to a large and raging squatter I was told (in.
effect) that I didn’t know enough about sheep to eat a
mutton-chop intelligently, so I gave up looking “ knowing’’
round the pens after that. The sheep-dog trials were
rather interesting ; one irate Scotsman from Yass, with a
aiher disappointing tyke, quite lost his temper when a.
group of tnen hanging on the fence cruelly told him that
the sheep would yard the dog. By the way, I didn’t see
any black sheep at the show—at least on four legs.
The N.S.W. United Fanciers’ dog, cat and men show at
the Exhibition, on 2nd ult., although opened by Governor
Jersey, was rather a dismal experience—the attendance
being a mere handful of queer doggy-looking men, and
two or three ladies headed by the eldest vice-regal
daughter in putty-coloured jacket and brown hat trimmed
with brown ribbons ; Mrs. W. P. Manning (mayoress) in
lavender-grey with floral vest and border bonnet en suite-,
who brought her younger daughter in dark-blue. But
the exhibits were interesting, and of all I liked the bow-
Wows best altho’ they did keep up an incessant yapping
And snarling (what ail ideal dog-fight there would be U
they all got loose some of these times !) which set the
cocks crowing until you couldn’t hear yourself think.
A dear little fluffy sky-terrier ungraciously met my
advances by nipping my sleeve with a set of rat-trap
teeth, but I found the big dogs far more sociable —a deadly k
looking creature-, with a face like a Chinese war god, re
ceiving my attentions in a manner quite contrary to the
fixed exppression of bis blood-shot eye. That ancient
aphorism about “ appearances,” &c., turns up, you see,
even at a dog-show. And, speaking of dogs, have you
ever remarked the likeness between the prize Toby at such
shows, and the master who hangs lovingly over him haP
the time ?
The evening I sat giggling at u Our Flat,” when the
auburn-wigged milkman came On, the gods, with one
shriek, christened him “ Jersey !” while even the d.c. was
Seen to give way to surreptitious smiles behind its feather
fan. By the Way, there was a woman in the circle in a
grey net gown, lined over with pale-pink ribbons, who was
as like Lady Jersey as her reflection in a looking-glass-
even to the way she dressed her hair, bht doubtless that
was a premeditated similarity. And I couldn’t help
thinking, as I gazed on her, what a boon it Would be to
Lady Jersey if she would hire this vice-regal alter ego tb
take her place when she was too bored to Show at the
theatres, public balls, big receptionSj and other places
where any little difference between the two Wouldn’t he
remarked. If “M. B. Jersey ” dolled her faC-sihiile up in
oneof her gowns and set her down beside Lord J., I’d bet a
Bernhardt treasury to a pair of gloves that notone in a
hundred would discover the deceit;
Talking about Lady J., reminds the thftt what the
Countess calls manners and what local people have beeh
taught to regard as manners, don’t come from the same
tome of etiquette; No doubt Lady J. is right (Australian
deportment hasn’t much to boast about, anyway), but,
still, it does seeni strange to See a Governor’s wife rising
to shake hands With any man or woman who claims her
acquaintance. The old rule —whacked Into the girls of a
dozen generations, 1 believe—was to rise for age and for
superior rank, but to remain seated before your own
compeers and gentlemen—but now that N.S.W.’s leading
lady has commenced popping up for all sorts of people, I
suppose society will hare to emulate her condescension-
At which most women will heave a regretful sigh. It was
a heavenly joy to many of them to watch some embarrassed
young man floundering over a waste of carpet to greet
them, as they sat, unmoved; according to what we have
all understood as etiquette.
The moral one deduces from that riotous farce “ Our
Flat,” at the Garrick, is that, unless there is a rich pa in
the immediate background, the girl who connubializes
with a literary character, who can’t sell his brains, doesn’t
know enough to come in out of the wet. As the feckless
female who follows such a blind matrimonial lead, Mary
Kingsley—barring her soft-soapy way of verbalizing, was
a square peg, and dressed herself very well—ditto her
atage stster, Marie Brooks, as “ Lucy Macallum. ’ In the
first act Margery wears terra-cotta silk with the front of
fancy tartan, trimmed with thick fringe on the one side ;
“ Lucy,” in a sweetly summery garment in lavender with
yoke, puffed sleeves and foot frill of cream mull, floral
hat; Act 2—“ Lucy,” all in white silk and lace—a charm-
ing get-up, but hardly the sort of garment a real lady
would slip into before luncheon. In a realistic sense,
curl-papers and a pink flannel wrapper would have been
miles nearer the target. But, what are frocks beside Mr,
Royce’s unctuous coughs and sudden sprawlings among
the furniture? or Polly Emery’s padded ankles and
delirious trippings over the tail of that tea-gown ? “ Our
Flat” is more funny than frocky.
The last performance but two of “ Lyons’ Mail,” at Her
Majesty’s, drew such a good house that it seems odd they
don’t keep it on at the Royal. A medical theatre-party
in the vice-regal box, all the ladies of which carried
sprays of flowers, lit up the circle, Mrs. (Ur.) Mackellar
wearing a handsome frock of black wafer net over maize-
satin, trimmed with black chiffon and gold-tinsel ; another
doctor’s wife had donned a well-mingled black and mauve
toilet; cream moire and tinsel braid (very fashionably
made) was sported by a distinctly plain woman in the
d.c.—l assure you this isn’t feminine spite, for it never
does to praise a woman and her dress, too. But Bessie
Bignold fainted rather crudely ; if stage-draperies won’t
keep down couldn’t they be loaded with shot like the
riding-skirts? Also, I couldn’t see quite why the far-
sighted management saw fit to put a knock-kneed lady
into knickerbockers.
The question that is agitating the Sydney theatre tram-
travelling public just at present is whether a woman
covered with diamonds, furs, and satins can negotiate a
journey with both feet up on the seat in front of her and
still expect the rest of the compartment to mistake her
for a duchess ? It’s rather a new experience nowadays to
see a woman put her feet tip—the great, throbbing
feminine tendency seems to be to put them down— hard.
Madame Weigal’s “Fashion Journal” for July is about
again, and in looking over its pages one feels soothed and
pleased to see that the frock, made in merry, merry May,
is just as stylish as ever. Rather a novelty for ball-room
wear and a saving clause to the woman with a neck like a
New York sheep-skin, is a “ fraise or ruff of tulle” worn
round the neck with low cut evening bodices. It is a
thickly niched or pleated band of tulle to match the gown
tied at the back of the neck with long bows and hems
Teaching to the hem of the garment. This interesting
authority also declares that badge and grenadine are
going to have a run—two wiry gauzes which put one’s
teeth on an end to touch them.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
On Saturday, June 13, the pupils of Miss Palmer,
assisted by several ladies and gentlemen, professional and
■amateur, gave a morning concert, which was opened with
the overture from “ Zampa,” played on two pianos by
eight bands ; this was followed by selections from Verdi,
Beethoven, Chopin, Liszt, and other eminent composers.
Miss Portus recited “ The Old Actor's Story,” and as an
■encore gave “Coming thro’ the Barley,” and Miss Palmer
played a rondo by Chopin, and in duos with Mrs. Teece
and Miss Grace Palmer. All the numbers were excellently
rendered, the time and phrasing throughout were perfect,
and, judging from the enthusiasm that prevailed in the
auditorium, Miss Palmer has every reason for self-gratu-
lation.

The Bedfords bought Covent Carden and
Long Acre 300 years ago for £l7O. Since then
they have themselves spent on the property cer-
tainly not more than £50,000, and its value is in-
calculable. It was put down then as worth
£6 6s. Bd. per year, and now it brings in from
£50,000 to £lOO,OOO a year. What have the Bed-

A just-discovered letter of the painter,
Rubens, in London National Gallery, says that

for fear of the rivalry of the other European
countries. It reads oddly now, this intelligence

Concerning the unfortunate gun explosion

the cook’s galley was blown out of its bolt-ropes,

The Glorious Fourth was marked in Sydney
by an official reception at the office of the IT.S.
Vice-Consul, to whom many citizens paid their
respects, and later in the day General Howell and
Mes-rs. Donald Manson and Livingston Hopkins
took with them down the harbour, per launch, to
Pearl Bay, about 40 friends, whom they had in-
vited, as has been their custom for some years past,
to celebrate the occasion. Mr. Hopkins pre-
sided at a generous luncheon, whereat champagne
flowed freely, and fully sustained Ids reputation
as an unapproachably humorous chairman.
Among the many speeches made,'the most notable
were those of Mr. Edmund Barton and Mr. G. R.
Dibbs—the latter of whom, in all innocence, tried
to carve the wooden ham with conventional trim-
mings, entrusted to his attention by “ Hop.” and
his fellow-conspirators. Mr. Dibbs, who (like

It is probable that the Bernhardt season
is being run at Sydney Her Majesty’s as much in
the interests of the serpentine Sara as in those of
the public. The dressing-rooms at the Royal ate
scarcely tit for the grooming of donkeys, much
less the toilette bf the human form divine, and
the extra tier at the Pitt-street house interposes
another gradation in price between the lordly ten
shillings of circle and reserved stalls and the wel-
come, if humble florin of the gallery. It has been
said that the £Bl5, taken at Sara’s opening night
in Melbourne, was the largest sum ever taken at
any one theatrical representation in Australia. It
may have been the most drawn by a dramatic
performance, but certain Sydney old-timers re-
member that Catherine Hayes on one occasion
filled the treasury of theancient VictoriaTheatre to
the tune of £l3OO by one concert performance. It
may also interest those who grumble, at the Bern-
hardt season’s prices to know that the Catherine
Hayes’ charges were, for circle, 30s. ; stalls, 21s. ;
upper circle, 155.; pit, 10s. Od. ; galleiy, ss. ; all
round * considerably over three times as much as
the prices prevailing at ttel Majesty’s for the Beth-
hardt-Abbey-Williamson season. The auction sale
bf circle and stall seats, not taken for the season,
held in the theatre and presided over by Auctioneer
Gorman was not an unmixed success. For this
there were several reasons. In the first place,
nearly all the best seats had been secured by
season-ticket holders, then, many of the people
who might have cared to give fancy prices had
seen Sara in Melbourne, finally, the first bloom of
the Bernhardt boom has been dissipated by the
rumours of long waits ahd capricious behaviour,
that have filtered over from the malodorous city.
Therefore, after the first and best seat had fallen
to the nod of “Falk” for £2 Bs., prices at once
dropped to 305., and thence, by easy stages, to 12s.
od., when proceedings were abruptly terminated.
The svelte and spirituelle Sara, (we have a long
list of these alliterative adjectives in readiness)
has hired a suite of eight rooms at Sydney’s latest

that of Mrs. James Brown-Potter, her servile
imitator): plays “La Tosca” to-night (Thursday);

At Sydney Royal “ The Gondoliers ” con-
cluded one of the most successful seasons ever
known at the house on Wednesday night. In
fact, it looked very much as the latest
joint production of G. and S. could have gone on
for yet another 20 nights to payable business. r l he
Opera Co. sailed for Brisbane on Wednesday,
whence they go to Maoriland, opening, it is said,
towards the end of July. As previously announce d
William and George Rignold, with the full strength
of H.M.’s company, opened on Wednesday night

duced for the first time in Australia.

There is no get away from the fact that
“Evangeline” is still doing S.R.O. business at
Sydney Criterion, though the circle audiences are
not so” stylish as they were wont to be. As a
consequence, the season has been extended till
July 31st, after which date “ Dr. Bill,” supported
by the original Sydney cast, will hang out his
brass-plate and commence to purge away melan-
choly with allopathic doi.es of laughter. One
consolatory feature about “ Vangy,” as it is
affectionately called “ behind,” is its good orclu s-
tratibn, and the ingenious conducting of Composer
Rice, whereby every point is accentuated, and the
singers are not drowned by, but are buoyed up
on, the accompaniment. Virginia Earl has made
herself a big favourite, chiefly by means of her
curls, white teeth, fetching smile, and winning
American way, but perhaps, also because of her
Henry Irving stride, which fascinates by reason
of its incongruous unexpectedness. Singing “I
like it,” the other night, she attributed Greer’s
defeat to his attack on the barmaids, whereupon
“Joey,” who was present, seized 1 1 is nail-can and
bolted to escape the titters of the sitters in his
vicinity.

Our prediction concerning “Our Flat”
seems likely to be realised. A change is necessary,
and if “something”—pending the arrival of
James Cassius, it is not known what—can be got
ready in time, the time-payment furniture will be
removed for the last time in Friday evening next.
Little Albion Whyte—peculiar combination of
names, suggestive of Emerald Green and Schwartz
Noir and Co.—deserves a line for the easy, grace-
ful manner in which she plays the inquisitive,
destructive child of the prying busybody of a
neighbour. Otherwise there is nothing to be said,
for “Teddy ” Royee and Polly Emery continue to
bear the burthen of the show and annex the
laughter and applause.

So far the Halles have succeeded in filling
Sydney Town Hall to its utmost on several occa-
sions, and the invariably crowded condition of the
cheaper seats effectually disposes of the hitherto
much promulgated theory that Sydney people
don’t care for high-class music and attend concerts
of that description for fashion’s sake only. Friday
and Saturday nights are announced as positively
the last.

Alf, Wyburd made a big splash at Bondi
Aquarium on the “ Glorious Fourth,” a day yearly
gaming more recognition from the republic-loving
Australians. On Sunday last, when Amy Blackie,
Harry Lester, Fred and other well-known
artistes performed, the attendance was pheno-
menal. The management has some novelty in
course of preparation; we don't exactly know
what, but believe it is a four legged fowl that eats
coals and speaks several languages, and emits
electric sparks when its tail is agitated.

Gaiety Burlesque is booming at Melbourne
Princess’. A fresh mob of low-browed, long-
ohinned chappies seem to have suddenly burst into
bloom at the button-hole, and the air of the dress-
circle boozery is heavy with the scent of acres of
carnations, as these nauseating noodles exchange
inanities concerning certain tall, showy young
women, who figure at the fag-end of the present
company in the intellectual capacity of legs. The
chappie persons are alleged to be'squatters, and
the fine, fleshy damsels are reported to like squatters
better than oyster-stew, therefore a good deal of
social interest attaches to the course of events up
yonder. Nevertheless there are portentous signs
that the old, simple faith in Gaiety burlesque is
severely shaken. A sceptical spirit "of enquiry is
abroad, Tha Sadducees of Melbourne are want-
ing to know why the lines of several songs are so
hideously stupid, also why the artists appointed
to warble this drivel don’t compose something
better out of their own heads as they go along. A
second hearing of ditties like “You wink the
other eye,” “What’s your price?” or “It’s
really most extraordinary, isn’t it ? ” sets rational
citizens wondering what they would think of a pri-
vateindi vidual who inflicted such cruelties upon his
friends in cold blood. They would think he was
what Fred. Leslie terms “a rotter.” However,
there are many other shows which cannot bear to
be looked at from this point of view, though it is
a quite legitimate way of considering items that
are hauled in by the heels and have no earthly
connection with the rest of the entertainment.
“ Ruv Bias and the Blase Roue ” has been pruned
and trimmed considerably since the opening night,
so that audiences can now withdraw in deadly
silence at a convenient hour. The apathy with
which they beat a retreat on Saturday night was
not a favourable symptom. It is the misfortune
of “Ruy Bias ” that, after the front scene of the
second act (and there are three acts altogether) it
begins to decline and fall, like the Roman Empire.
From simple softening of the brain it degenerates
into gibbering lunacy. Happily the management
saw fit to cut out, as soon as possible, an un-
pleasant chunk of “wholesome fun,” in which
Irving was represented as an aged ballet-girl.
Now, Irving is the last man who should be held up
to ridicule in a Gaiety burlesque, for he makes, or
did make, a practice of paying supernumerary girls
double what they could get for the same work
from most other managers, the extra money being
intended to encourage respectability, social purity,
or whatever Mr. Varley calls it. But no matter,
Nellie Barren seems to grow on the Australian
taste, when she isn’t singing, although the delicate
humour of a London gamin accent will never be
hugely admired outside New Babylon. Her
strong grip of the burlesque art is most evident
in a love-scene with Grace Pedley. Leslie lays
himself out to vary his clever business in small
details, and Fred Storey’s limb-throwing is
certainly quicker and “cleaner” than last time.
Danby counts for very little in this show, how-
ever, whilst the dancing of Sylvia Grey and
Florence Levey (both of whom have now settled
down into an elegant stride) arouses no furore.
The local article, as purveyed by the Royal
ballerinas, is much better than it used to be,
whereas the Gaiety tripping has, perhaps, deterio-
rated in quality and undoubtedly lost its glamour.
As for the lovely amazons who stand around and
ogle, they are pathetic illustrations of the differ-
ence between mind and matter. Admitting all
these things, the fact remains that “ Ruy Bias ”
is bright in its way, especially at the outset, and
a handsome spectacle all the time.

“Run Wild,” the sad story of a ’appy
ome broken up by the introduction of a terrier
dawg, has been doing only moderately at the
Opera House. Sometimes the terrier gets a bone
in his throat and coughs promiscuously, but
generally speaking, he is a gloomy failure. On
Saturday next Jennie Lee retires in favour of
“The County Fair,” with its mechanical race-
scene and other features recently sampled by
Sydneyites.

Revivals of old friends are following one
another in weekly parts at the Bijou, the only
Melbourne theatre where common-sense is enjoy-
ing a look in just now. On Saturday they put up
“ Caste ” with cheerful results, this neatest of
Robertson’s comedies being popular alike with the
“gods” and the society people who dye young.
The latter love to hear Captain Hawtrey and the
Marquise hold forth upon the immutable laws of
caste, without understanding that the author is
poking borak at blue-blood and sticking pins into
parvenus. The former see in Ecoles a true type
of the philanthropist who never robs his brother
of a day’s work, but is quite open to annex his
beer. They have, after all, no occasion to wince
at the miserable old ruin, because his sym-
pathies are with capital, not with labour,
and his one notion of independence is unlimited
credit at the little church round the corner.
The excellence of the “Caste” performance, in
which all"the B. and B. originals appear again, is
an oft-told tale. The Broughs, Mr. and Mrs., are
always at their best as Esther Eccles and Sam
Gerridge— a London mechanic to the life. Miss
Romer and Percy Lyndal take high honours, and
if Anson’s fine conception of Eccles is in danger
of being oyercoloured, as much may be insinuated
against Titheradge and Pattie Browne, both of
whom seem greater favourites than ever in their
old parts. Pattie’s pert self-consciousness is be-
coming very marked. There will be a “Caste”
matinee this Friday (10th), and on the following
night “Diplomacy ” comes to stay for a week.

At the Alexandra they have had about
enough of Wild West wind, which doesn’t whistle
like it did. Therefore “The Trapper” is fixing
up his traps, including cowboys and Indians, and
the interesting savage who languishes for love of
Lily Dampier will have to be quick and drown
himself in the tank before Carver can bundle him
back to his wigwam. “The Trapper” retires
forthwith, the Dampier setting of “His Natural
Life ” being due on Saturday.

Various halls are in active eruption, more
so than usual. Frank Clark contrives to keep
matters cheery at the Gaiety ; the immortal Billin
iscooin’ away on his managerial perch at the
Vie.; and a Novelty Company are struggling with
fate at the St. George’s, The novelty appears to
consist of nigger. Miss Ada Fitzroy has earned
a good name for herself at the Waxworks. The
supporters of that old-established institution roll
up steadily to laugh at her shadowgraphs, or turn
pale at the thought of a fragile young lady being
able to carry 30 names with their respective
numbers in her classical little head. Ada’s
skill as a shadowgraphist sets one smiling
at Fred Leslie’s one crude attempt in the same
direction, which quite knocks them up at the
Princess’. The Battle of Waterloo Cyclorama re-
mains at two shillings a head, although the Siege
of Paris is on the spot, rolled up in readiness for
the completion of the Bourke-street building. Mr.
Jude is gathering honey at his Musical Evenings
in the Melbourne district, and the perennial
Lynch Family Bellringers, who have come out
again quite as good as new, are doing ditto. They
ravage the suburbs five nights of the week, and
return triumphant to the Athenaeum every Satur-
day.

In one respect Sara Bernhardt is a dis-
appointment—when she writes a letter on the
stage there is the same awful want of probability
about the document as of old, for she writes it in
just the same unsatisfying way as any other
artiste. In other words, she gets hold of the pro-
perty ink-bottle with a reckless disregard of con-
sequences that ought to make the ink fly up in her
eye, and which would do so if there were ink in it.
Then she grasps the pen and plunges it into the pot
with much vigour, and next shebounds and gambols
for about three seconds on top of a large sheet of
paper, and the document is finished. Then she
addresses it by rushing at the epistle a second
time, and administering one wild wallop on the
envelope; and when her correspondent opens it,
and solemnly reads two columns of literary matter,
and goes mad on account of the statements which
Sara has inserted, the audience doesn’t seem at
all surprised. This sort of thing is irritating,
but unhappily it is unavoidable; if Sara
were true to historical fact, and wrote that letter
just as Cleopatra would have written it, it is three
chances to one that the audience would break into
riot and wreck the theatre. For when Cleopatra
wanted to write to Antony, it is most likely that
she spread herself all over the table, and nearly
brained Charmian and Iras with her elbows as
she stuck them out in all directions, and wasted
four hours and eight sheets of papyrus, and bobbed
her head laboriously as she made her up-strokes,
and jerked her tongue out painfully to keep time
with the down-strokes, and not only inked herself
up to the eyes, but scattered huge blots over most
of Antony’s legions as well, and nearly wore her-
self out hunting for the big words in the Egyptian
dictionary of the period. And when the literary
effort was finished she was probably led away by
her attendants to get the ink washed off her,
while the document was despatched to its destina-
tion by a eunuch mounted on an elephant. That
sort of thing might be true to nature and history,
but the audience wouldn’t stand it.
** * *
The Sara Bernhardt speculation of six
nights’ and three matinees’ tenancy of the Ade-
laide Royal has proved very successful to those
who undertook the risk, though Wybert Reeve
didn’t profit much over the affair. The repertoire
included “Camille,” “FrouFrou,” “LaTosca,”
“Adrienne Leoouvreur,” “Jeanne D’Arc,” and
“Fedora,” and the attendances were large, and
the applause, on the whole, satisfactory, consider-
ing that but few in the audience really understood
what was going on. The scenery used in the pro-
ductions has been seen in the Adelaide theatre for
a number of years, and the company, after the
French star, were locally pronounced second-rate.
Tommy Hudson is doing wonders with his Min-
strel Company at Garner’s Rooms, and A. Middle-
ton, representing the MacMahons, has made great
preparations for a successful season with the
phonograph at thejTown Hall. Capt. De Burgh
explains the invention.
At Poverty Point.
Enthusiastic stallist, on Sara’s last Melbourne show :
“By Jingo, the house was so tight that it cracked like
fat old Mrs. ’s bodice, when she’s going down the
Collins-street Block.”
The tragedian’s full name was Thomas Barry Sullivan,
as inscribed on his coffin, but people mistakenly thought
he took a stage-name, just as they were mistaken in
thinking Creswick the right name of another eminent.
Henry- Abbey’ is negotiating with Adelina Patti for a
visit to Australia, and hopes to return here with her very
shortly.
What crank paid for the insertion in Sydney E. News of
a-third of a column trying to prove that it was wicked to
call Sara “Divine”?
Let Sydney beware. Nothing in her Australian experi-
ences has more irritated the “divine” Sara than the
senseless rounds of applause, dragged in without rhyme
or reason at the slightest pause, which have spoilt some
of her best scenes. The born idiots who wish people to
believe that the'' understand French are solely respon-
sible for this, and should be watched.
Honour to whom honour is due. The financial risk of
the Bernhardt engagement rests entirely with Abbey and
Grau, Williamson and Garner merely finding the theatres.
Even the expense of decorating Madame’s dressing-room,
at Melbourne Princess’, was borne by Henry Abbey. But
the “ firm ” took the credit all the same, w’hereat Abbey
waxed wroth.
“Laura Villiers, who is to appear at the re-opening of
Melbourne Koyal, is a daughter of London Pavilion
Villiers. She is slight and rather short, with fairish hair,
a sweet voice, not too powerful, and is very near-sighted.
In England her appearances have been mostly in the
provinces. The lady has money.
Bernhardt and Gaiety successes notwithstanding, the
prospect of Irving and Terry, or the Kendalls coming to
Australia is more than doubtful. Bernhardt has the rest-
less desire for travel and is never long in Paris. The
Gaiety management have two companies of nearly equal
merit and can always spare one abroad, whilst the other
keeps alight the sacred lamp at the London Gaiety.
Toole, with about the smallest theatre in London, can
only draw there for about four months in the year, and
has to get somew’here for the rest of the time. But
Irving and Terry can jjlay in London all the year round,
and the great Henry will never, like some other stars, act
with cheap scenery, or properties, or a cheap company.
James Brown Potter is described by one who knows him
well as one of the handsomest men alive, with a beautiful
voice. And yet she preferred Bellew.
When Manager A. and Manager B. visit England and
America they are entertained and made much of by
Managers 0. and D. But when Manager C. and bis wife,
and the wife of Manager D. visit Australia, Managers A.
and B. are either unable or unwilling to return the com-
pliment. A mistake, as a little time will show. Apart
from this, is not Australia wanting in some respects in its
treatment of members of the profession ? Where else
would a pimply-faced publican tell people willing to pay
liberally for accommodation that “we do not take pro-
fessionals” as at Adelaide ?
The scene in Bernhardt’s “ Tosoa,” where Ploria first
sees and then clutches tne knife to kill Scarpia, is a
psychological study of the finest kind, and worth all the
rest of the play put together.
In “Gamille,” the opening piece in Adelaide, Sara
Bernhardt suffered so much from cold in the theatre
that she was practically unable to do more than walk the
part. But the daily critics got there all the same,,
although they cannot quite make up their minds about
Mrs. Brown Potter. “We understood her, jou know.”
Lady Hopetoun says that she made eight unsuccessful
tries to obtain seats for “The Dancing Girl,” at London
Haymaket. Yet when they produce Jones’ play at
Melbourne Royal, her ladyship will be able to book the
vice-regal box at the first attempt. Which shows that
the difference between a Governor’s wife “at home” and
abroad is very, very considerable, but by no means goes
to prove that a play which has a modern British dock for
its hero, will carry this country by storm. Laura Villiers
is said to have paid a lot of money for the Australian
rights, nevertheless-.
Emma Eames, a new operatic prima donna, is about to
join herself in matrimony with Julian Story, the well-
known portrait-painter. Alas ! the case of Ellen Terry
and G. E. Watts was a solemn warning to all who contem-
plate forming a stage and studio guild of this description.
They seem all right in theory—husband paints himself,
and wife paints herself—but in practice the idea generally
turns out a failure. Husband and wife have a hard brush
and try to paint one another as often as not.
Abbey says the Bernhardt exchequer is most satis-
factory, and if Sydney and Brisbane come up to expecta-
tions the tour will be a great success financially.
Some consternation was caused amongst the occupants
of the reserved stalls at Bernhardt’s “La Tosca,” in
Adelaide. Just on eight o’clock, w'hen the reserved seats
were nearly all filled with social cream in evening dress,
in walked a Celestial in moleskin pants and slouch hat.
He had booked his little seat, so they had to take him.
He sat out the play with stolid indifference.
Mrs. Henry Abbey (Miss Florence Girard) was some
time leading lady at the London Haymarket, under the
Bancrofts, and was considered the most beautiful woman
then on the stage.
How far will superstition extend? One of Augustus
Harris’ companies was to open the Northampton Theatre,
rebuilt after a fire. At the last moment the little man
almost cancelled the engagement because he discovered
that peacock-feathers had been painted on the act-drop.
But Janet Achuroh carried a (Colombo) fan of the same
feathers in “Forget-Me-Not,” everywhere. Mrs. Ban-
croft always scattered a packet of pins in front of the
green-room pier-glass on first nights for luck, and every
actress that ever was carries about with her a select assort-
ment of old horse-shoes.
Tearle is not the only actor who could be altogether up-
set by any display of indifference on the part of an
audience. Sothern w 7 as just as bad. One night, exas-
perated by a man who w r as ostentatiously leaving a
private box during the second act, he called out to him,
“Do you know that there is another act, sir?” “Yes,”
was the very audible reply, “that’s exactly why lam
going.”
When Charles Warner was playing Badger in “The
Streets of London” in the English provinces, the
manager at one tow’n engaged the local brigade for the
fire scene, and made a feature of the realistic effect. But
the realism was carried too far when they turned the hose
with real water on the “eminent” one, w’hose language
was painful in the extreme.
Wanted to know 7 , not necessarily for publication, but as
a guarantee of good faith. Who is Clifton Alderson, the
coming leading man at Melbourne Royal ?
There are points of interest in the memoirs of tie
Bancrofts, written by themselves. Notably as to the
date of their first introduction to H.R.H. Tummy, and
the reticence as to the birth of Charley, the eldest son.
“ Nearly all the travelling histrions prefer Sydney. It is
not only the place, but the treatment they receive.
Ability is no passport in Melbourne, only a high-sounding
name, a valueless connection, or money,” writes an irate
pro. Writes he truly ?
Warner spoilt J. A. Clyndes’ chance out here by coining
first, but the latter is the better elocutionist and finer
actor of the two.
On the night the Melbourne Royal opens, the Alexandra
closes, for fustigation. Then Simonsen opera-troupe;
then Alfred’s pantomime, “Jack the Giant-killer.”
A striking feature in Irving’s “Corsican Brothers” is
the tick of the clock, as the ghost rises, to the well-known
music.
“ Baconian ” writes: “ Please explain why there are no
MSS. of Shakespeare, while those exist of Jonson, Raleigh,
Spenser, Bacon, etc.” Haven t time.
Joily, a great French comedian, w 7 ho died a few weeks
ago, owed his luck to a raihvay accident, which fractured
his jaw, and gave him a funny face.
Ellen Terry writes of herself: “As a girl I used to tuck
my big hands under my arms, like a pullet going
to roost.” Who else could write that about her? What
style so charming as the autobiographic?
Fred. Leslie introduces in “ Ruy Bias” his burlesque of
Irving, as the ballet dancer, which he withdrew 7 in London
out of deference to the tragedian’s feelings, which were
ruffled by the disinterment of the fact that he (Irving)
actually appeared on the stage in female costume many
times, as the Witch in the Edinburgh Christmas panto-
mime.
Gordon Craig, Ellen Terry s son, shapes well as an
actor, but she could not make anything of her daughter,
Ailsa Craig—so named. Craig imitates Irving, of course,
and is a dead professional spit of him. When Macready
was tutoring a Mrs. Clifford, on the stage, she exclaimed,
semaphoring her arms, “ If this goes on, we shall all be
Maoreadys 1” How Barry Sullivan imprinted his stamp,
with the crook-knee stride, on all the Melbourne stage-
struck of his era 1
Burton, English oomique, has a pathetic new song,
“ The Burglar.” Manager Somers came to him the other
day and said, “A gentleman told me he was moved to
tears by the pathos of that beautiful little story.” Burton:
“Oh, pray introduce me to him.” Somers: “It is Mr.
Binns, the hangman.”
Bernhardt’s Co., all told, are 38. They went from Mel-
bourne to Adelaide by steamer, not rail, and cut it very
fine, so as to jeopardise the opening, unless the Oroya got
in strictly to time. The Oroya has a peculiarly cosy music-
saloon, wherein the Frenchmen had a high old time, and
the trip will not soon be forgotten by Leumane and the
others privileged to share it.
Most ludicrous are the London notices of Barry Sullivan.
For instance, a first-class paper is before us, with an
elaborate critique written by a man who evidently newer
saw him. The writer refers to his imposing presence and
big sonorous voice, which he was so proud of using, and
which filled the biggest theatre. Why, these are the very
two things he was most deficient in. The notices written
are of G. Y. Brooke, not Sullivan at all. Says one—“He
had none of the subtlety of Irving ’’—not Irving’s, but his
Richard was equally subtle. A critic who has seen him
thinks his best part was Faulconbridge in “King John.”
The only actor who never craved for original parts, and,
indeed, didn’t like them. Good old leg !
St. Maur writes a wonderful letter about Bernhardt in
the Barrier (N.S.W.) Miner. We are not sure it is quite
fair, but any spice that way makes it more entertaining.
Sara Bernhardt, in Melbourne, spoke in the highest
terms of the “genius” of Mrs. Brown-Potter. Great
people are generous in this kind of way, and Sara said
Mrs. Potter could excel in lines she dared not attempt 1
Perhaps so, though we don’t believe it.
Coppin got to work at once gutting the Melbourne
Royal. Shows himself fully abreast of the time, for, when
W. and G. and everybody else failed to tender up to
mark by the end of 1890, Coppin and Co. at once got their
architect’s plans for a virtually new 7 theatre. The place is
reduced to the mere skeleton, naught but the walls,
floors and pillars of the tiers, so that all will be brand-
new, like the Princess’ or Bijou.
Madame Simonsen has engaged Signor Maffezzoli as
opera conductor. The old-time Australian conductors
were Lavenu, Linley Norman, and Loder, and Lyster
brought Reiff, since whom there has been a long succes-
sion of batonists: Siedc, Marzorati, Oiorza, Van Ghele
Hughes, Harrison, Cellier, and so on, Maffezzoli is a very
ardent young man, and ought to succeed, like the ener-
getic Hazon.
The worst of these new Italian opera troupes, for Aus-
tralia, is that they are so confoundedly lazy. They stick
to the demnition old grind of “Trovatore,” “Faust,”
Luorezia,” “Lucia,” and think of nothing but olives and
wme. “ More study 1” is their whine, like the supe. when
handed his part of half-a-side.
G‘- attan R'ggs may be popping up again anon at
Melbourne Opera House.
Wybert Reeve was out of pocket over the Bernhardt.
W.Vbert simply negotiated for Sara as an advertisement.
Julia Mathews’ old father always took tickets at the pit
of the theatre where she played, while the mother acted
as lady’s-maid to the daughter.
Beneath we give the seating accommodation of some of

DOyley Carte’s Opera House, 1976. These,* it will be
understood, are all opera houses, nevertheless, we will
compare them with our Australian theatres, thus, Sydney

alterations), 1700 ; Garrick, 1150; Gaiety, 980 ; Opera
850 ; Lyceum (unfinished), 1700 ; Melbourne—Alexandra!
2500 ; Royal, 2350 ; Princess, 2200 ; Opera House, 2100 ;
Bijou, 1750. We haven’t the figures relating to the
Brisbane, Adelaide, Bendigo and Ballarat theatres, but
believe they vary from 1000 to 2000 seats. Here, we
mention,: lest any Australian should fancy that bur
theatres, like our scullers and fighters, can’t be licked
that the Grand Theatre, Leeds, seats, without any bother'
4000 people.
Janet Achuroh was to have played at Wagga the other
evening. As there were three feet of water in the pit of
the Oddfellows’ Hall, and as several families were roosting
in the circle, she didn’t.
It is said that the Duke of Edinburgh once asked Bern-
hardt what had become of the “h ” that ordinarilv con-
cludes her front name. To this she replied : “ Oh, I have
lent it to ze pauvre Engleesh ; zey want eet zo moosh.”
A Broken Hill (N.S.W.) P.M. has decided, in the case
Mahoney v. Ridge, a suit for £l4 10s. 6d., wages due, that
a “ performer ” does not come under the definition of a
servant as furnished by the Masters and Servants Act
Consequently, though Ridge admitted owing the bulk of
the money, the case was dismissed. Barbarism !'
A Bendigonian w-rites to remind us that Sara Bernhardt
has played in the British provinces—viz., a week at Bitr-
nnngham, Manchester, Edinburgh, or Glasgow and Liver-
pool, in the autumn of ’B4.
Harry Rickards and wife, who purpose playing a season
in South Africa ere return, sailed for England per
Orizaba.
Baritone Imano sails for America in the Alameda. So
does Lena Salinger, engaged at Frisco Tivoli. For the
information of ’Frisco friends, we may say that Mr.
Imano, who came here two years ago with Johnny
Sheridan, has since played the principal baritone parts n
“Dorothy,” “lolanthe,” and Poo-bah in the “ Mikado ’*
(he played it for 15 months in England) with Williamson
and Garner’s opera company throughout Australasia, He
has a well-trained, round, sweet and forceful baritone of
great range.
Manager Seville, now in Australia, is making paths
straight for Sell Bros’, circus and menagerie, which arrives
here from ’Frisco in October. One of the Sells was hers
with Cole.
Barry Sullivan was as great an.autocrat before as behind
the curtain. “Order” was Sullivan’s first law. No
matter in what part of the house, no matter who was con-
cerned, order had to be kept. One night a party ou
military men, with a couple of well-known ladies (one ofi
them still, after a stormy career, much to the fore in,
Sydney all-wool society), occupied the o.p. box, and were
extremely noisy. The partv was so rowdy that Sullivan—
who was not engaged on the stage—walked round th®
circle with a stately stride, entered the box, and with a
most courtly bow requested the whole lot to clear out—
which they did, amidst cheers from all parts of the house
These people were causing a public scandal about this
time, the press designating the gentlemen, “ male
poodles.”
Fitzgerald Bros., of circus fame, are resting at Bendigo,
for the purpose of training horses, &c. They are brethren,
of the senior member for West Sydney.
The new Melbourne Cyclorama, Siege of Paris, will;
soon open; all the fixings have arrived from ’Frisco.
With Waterloo, Eureka Stockade and Siege running at
once, cyclorama business will probably be overdone in,
Melbourne, but other folks were nibbling after the dirt-
cheap site, and the directors thought it better to invest
their surplus than allow competition from outside.
A fund has been raised in England to assist Tom Squire.,
once with the Gaiety Company, to visit Australia He ig
consumptive.
R. B. Wiseman, now, unhappily, altogether blind, is to,
get a benefit at one of the Sydney theatres.
The new Chief Judge in Equity has given a verdict for
defendant in the long-pending Want v. Moss case, over
Sydney Royal’s O.P. box. As matters now' stand each
party has its use on alternate nights. Now Bernhardt,
goes to Her Majesty’s it won’t be worth quite so much.
Captain Jack Sutton wishes folks to understand that he
has seceded from Wirth’s Circus, and intends to paralyse
the people of Australia with some novelties in the near
future.
The Forbes-Crook-and-Lyle Dramatic Company have
been showing at Brisbane Gaiety in some of Frank
Harvey’s melodramas. Curiously enough Dan Barry,
another travelling theatrical, struck Brisbane Opera
House at the same time, when he “ knocked ” them with
“His Natural Life.”
Louis Lohr writes to say that he has never seen things
in general so lively in Maoriland. The Patey business has
been splendid everywhere ; returns from 27 concertsabout
£5OOO, and speculators in several towns actually bought
the seats in advance and auctioned them at a profit.
There are only one or two inferior companies in the
country who have been stranded there, and Maoriland
seems more capable of supporting good shows during the
coming season than at any previous period. The amiable
Lohr is now making things smooth in Tasmania.
We have just seen a private letter (in pencil) from Harry
Edwards, dated New York, May 21. In this communica-
tion he speaks of himself as “ a broken-down man,” and
says that he had been suffering since February with
“ grippe,” rheumatism and pneumonia. Altogether the
letter is a hopeless one, and it looks very much as if
there were some truth in the rumour concerning the
death of the brave and gentle actor and entomologist.
“ Johnny ” Sheridan has decorated Vincent West with

and true to nature.
Dear Bulletin,— ln reading your last issue I was par-
ticularly struck with a paragraph under the heading of
Poverty Point. The joke in question ran as follows :
“The real reason of Elton’s re-engagement. The ‘Firm’
wanted George Walton to take the former’s place, but,
leaving the offer too late, found that the latter had
arranged to take out a company of his own and would not
renew. Which means an extra ten pounds per week to
the great E.” Now the little funnyment is not a bad gag
as it stands, but it is not complete. I propose to supply
the other half, which runs thusly:—ln the first place,
Elton is not re-engaged; in the second, the great E. does
not receive ten pounds per week extra; and finally,
Walton was not offered a re-engagement of any sort what-
ever. Of that there is no possible doubt, no probable
possible shadow of doubt, no possible doubt whatever.—
Yours, &c., Wm. Elton.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Brougham said : “ Commonwealth means
Republic.”
“ Freetrade is gaining ground daily?”
In what country ?
No deposit is required from parliamentary
candidates in South Australia.
The voice of the Australian majority has
emphatically declared for Protection.
Now that many of the lawyers have been
driven from N.S.W. Parliament, law-reform is
ahead.
In Maoriland, 48 people own lands worth
£9,788,450; and 1116 possess holdings worth
£34. 848, 612.
T he Melbourne dailies are fiercely whipping
up the Conservative voters in view of the political
labour-storm ahead.
Fifty Labour members in the next Vic-
torian Parliament, after the example of the unpre-
pared party in N.S. Wales.
Queensland has been borrowing money in
London at the rate of 2| millions sterling every
year since 1884—Griffith’s ten-millions loan year.
The Bill pro - forma in the Queensland
Parliament this year was one “to Amend the
Law relating to Noxious Animals.” Dog Towzer?
In 1889, out of 20 millions of acres of
land alienated from the Crown in N.Z., 17,987,507
acres were owned by 1615 persons. Of these,
1140 were permanent absentees.
A Melbourne scribe sums up the crowd
that gathered at the opening of Parliament as “ a
congregation of people of no consequence, some of
them cockneys in cocked hats.”
The new Australian Parliamentary Labour-
party may be compared to a rapid stream running
between two old crumbling party-lands and
gradually encroaching on their banks.
After the first rough statement at Wagga
of the Murrumbidgee polling, Arthur Rae, one of
the members-elect, called for and got three
thundering “cheers for the Republic !”
Parkes proposes as an obvious sop to the
N.S.W. Democratic party, to create a Minister of
Industry. He has amongst his political following
many chevaliers of industry to select from.
The Victorian Assembly has rejected on
the voices Sir Bryen O’Loghlen’s motion refusing
to sanction Federation —save on a One-man one-
vote basis. The Southern Labour-party will see
about this matter —after next general election.
Treasurer Ballance, of Maoriland, pro-
poses to abolish the property-tax and substitute a
progressive land and income tax. The effect of
this would be to relieve small farmers of direct
taxation, and throw the burden on the mono-
polists.
Never a reference lias been made this
session by Premier Munro, in the Victorian Par-
liament, to the recent death, in harness, of his
late colleague, Langridge. Probably, Munro owes
him a grudge for dying and letting in Labour-
leader Hancock.
Let no one make a mistake. One Man
One Vote may be “in sight ” but it is not coming
without a political death-grapple between the
Conservative and Democratic parties. The drums
of the allotment-mongers are now rolling from
Cape York to Cape Otway.
In re Canadian Lady Macdonald’s cabled
“elevation” to the peerage: In 1791 Fox quar-
relled with Burke over Pitt’s scheme of Canadian
peerages, and, said Fox, “ Are those red and blue
ribands, which have lost their lustre in the Old
World, to shine fresh again in the New ?”
Thirty members of the new N.S.W. Par-
liament are said to be pledged to the programme
of the never-touch-its. Once more The Bulletin
asks Boss Templar Clark (who is bald —this doesn’t
look well) what the prohibitionists intend to do
about the Australian wine-industry ? Are the
vineyards to be rooted up?
A Primrose-Leaguer was endeavouring to
persuade an audience that, Home Rule granted,
agricultural England would swarm with Irish
labourers, and that this would cut down the wages
of the Englishmen, “Ah,” rapped out an old
lady, “you don’t want any assistance in that—
you’d ’a’ had ’em over here afore now if they’d ’a’
done that.”
A Bulletin correspondent advocates the
abolition of the poll-tax on Chinese and the sub-
stitution of total prohibition, with free passages
to China for all who choose to return; a yearly
tax of £lO per head on those who remain ; a tax
on all those who employ Chinese labour and the
public declaration by each employer of a Chinaman
of the fact.
During an election campaign a parson
called on an old lady to solicit her husband’s vote
for the conservative candidate. “No, sir,” said
she, “he’ll vote for the labour candidate.” “But
what has the labour candidate done for you?”
“ He has done a great deal, sir,” was the reply—
“ I’ve been living here for2o years and he’s at last
brought you into my house.”
One of the items which should have the
unceasing attention of the Australian “ Woman’s
Rights ” party is the law of inheritance. A man
at marriage “endows” his wife “with his goods;”
yet he is at perfect liberty to cut oft her and her
children in his will with fourpence each and leave
all his wealth to his mistresses and their illegiti-
mate children—or to do any other thing, sane or
mad, that he pleases.
In a late Leicestershire election the fol-
lowing quotation from the Times was placarded
in the Liberal interest:—
The landlord’s only notion of a peasant is as the payer
of rent, his only notion of Government as the squanderer
of grants ! When the cottiers can pay no rent he turns
them out to die, and when Ministers will give no more
money he turns round and blackguards them.
The quotation is 37 years old.
Adye Douglas—the Parkes of Tasmania,
who some years ago posed as a violent Republican
and in that capacity absolutely shocked his fellow
members of the Federal Council —finds that the
Federation Bill is not Conservative enough!
Douglas wants the Senate to amend money bills,
and he opposed a Federal Court of Appeal- on the
ground that a foreign Privy Council is the best
for a free Commonwealth.
Mr. Frank Cotton, of the N.S.W. Parlia-
mentary Labour-party, appears to be rather too
thick with Premier Parkes, and to accept far too
many little civilities at his hands, for their mutual
political independence to long continue. Either
Cotton will convert Parkes or Parkes will convert
Cotton—who, it is stated, dined with the old man
the other night. “ I will talk with you, walk
with you, but I will not eat with you, drink with
you nor pray with you.”
ADVERTISE OR BURST.
STAR (to wife Just returned from rehearsal): “Well, I don't think you need let that fellow
see you home any more, all the town will be talking of it.”
SHE: “We must advertise, and that’s as good a way as any other.”
During the Murrurabidgee (N.S.W.) con-
test the principal concern of Parkes’ poodles was
as to the probability of Dibbs’ return. The totals
placed the successful ones thus :
GormlY
R a E
DibbS
The initial letters of the trio are also those of
George Richard Dibbs, and the final letters answer
the question in the affirmative.
Clark, M.P., lately elicited in the Com'
mons that a professional official, pensioned for
failing health and eyesight, had got a private
appointment in the same line at £2OOO a year.
Which reminds us that a young man who is under-
stood to have made a fortune in speculation lately
retired from the N.S.W. Civil Service on a medical
certificate in enjoyment of a State pension. The
first thing lie did was to offer himself as a candi-
date for Parliament. He was rejected.
Tire tale of the Queensland Coalition
Government. Premier Griffith, a few years back,
swore that he would be no party to any further
alienation of the people’s lands. Jumeau
MTI wraith vowed that he would ne’er consent to
let Queensland pay subsidy to the British Naval
Tribute. Three short years and—the Crown
lands are to be sold wholesale to find Treasurer-
Mac. money, and the Naval Tribute dividend is
to be paid as a sop to Griffith’s loyalty.
Munro now proposes to enfranchise all
women. The Bulletin hopes to see women
enfranchised, but it trusts that the Victorian
electors will allow no scheme for female suffrage
to endanger what is Democracy’s most urgent
need —the thorough enfranchisement of the men.
It is necessary first to obtain One-Man-Otie-Vqte,
in order that the great Radical reforms which
hinge thereon may be effectuated, and secured
from the influence of the inevitable Tory reaction,
consequent on the ascendancy which Democracy’s
enemies, the clergy at large, will temporarily
obtain at the hands of the female voters.
Queensland Government has cleared its
first Parliamentary fence, the Address-in-Reply
being adopted without a division. This means
that Donaldson & Co., and the Adullamites ready
to cross-support any new party, are not anxious
to take over a tangled, semi-insolvent concern just
yet. “Uncle” Jessop’s resignation as Chair-
man of Committees—“ Uncle ” was always a
Mcllwraithian when the term included Morehead
& Co., but never a Coalitionist —and the appoint-
ment in his stead of Arthur Morgan, the Warwick
newspaper-man and prominent Darling-Downs
“ buncher,” is ominous of a personal rifting of the
present Ministerial conglomerate.
In Brisbane has been formed a “Patriotic
League,” whose avowed objects are :
1. To ensure to every man the peaceable enjoyment of
his earnings and savings and his personal liberty.
2. To uphold law and order, and to oppose organised
communism and socialism.
3. To protect the interests and credit of the colony.
No. 1 is evidently incomplete ; it should read
“ earnings, savings and stealings.” The Patriotic
League may be left to dine itself to death. And
so may the bogus “National” League, a Tory
institution just started in Melbourne, no list of
the objects whereof is necessary after you have
read the names of its promoters.
According to a Sydney Sunday paper there
are in the eleven principal electorates of Sydney
and suburbs no less than 22,341 non-residential or
plural votes out of 109,581 — i.e., rather more than
one-fifth of the total number. These are thus
divided :—Balmain, 9789 voters—non-residential,
2172; Canterbury, 18,704-4008 ; Central Cumber-
land, 9914—1875; Glebe, 4752—450; Newtown,
8163 —1342 ; Paddington, 10,390 —1578 ; Redfern,
9900—907 ; St. Leonards, 7379—1701; East Syd-
ney, 10,041 —4708: South Sydney, 9862—1148;
West Sydney, 10,821—2440. Under such cir-
cumstances it is wonderful that any Labour mem-
bers were elected at all.
B. D. Morehead has been fare welled in
London at a banquet, and is coming mail-haste “ to
rescue Queensland from her present straits.”
Morehead is aghast at the result of the N.S.W.
elections, and. thinks he would be failing in his
duty to Queensland if he absented himself longer.
“ The Labour-members,” says he, “are agitators
who are ready to set class against class, and never
cared for the welfare of the labourer.” Morehead
did—in 1884 ! In that year he tried to hoodwink
the very democratic constituency of Fortitude
Valley by opposing the late F. Beattie, but some
of the latter’s friends, on polling-day, just loaded
a lorry up with stage kanakas and Chinese, all
sandwiched with placards—“ Vote for my welly
good friend, Missee Morehead,” and the working-
man saw through all the cabs and beer, and placed
Morehead a good last. Then, on the death of
sturdy old Crimean-shirted Jacob Low, he sneaked
to the back-block squatting electorate of the
Balonne (pronounced locally “Balloon ”), and got
returned for that. He has been in the balloon
ever since, but ho may soon fall out of it. More-
head has brilliant talents, and an almost intuitive
knowledge of party-politics, but his sympathies—
as squatters’ agent, banker, importer, forward and
supply agent, &c. —are invariably against the
wage-earner. He loves labour only at election-
times, and never at all so long as he’s safe in his-
balloon.
In a Lightning- Bath.
The world has now partially discovered that mere*
medicaments cannot be used as probably remedial
for all diseases. In almost every case of illness:
excepting those of violent accidents and judicial,
hangings, the knife or the detergent are used withi
a free hand, and frequently with unfavourable.*
results. But, widely speaking, we,are gradually-
coming out of this darkness of blind trust in ai
nasty herb, or a sharp knife, and recognising thatt
in almost every case of disease the cause is the;
absence in the suffering system of electricity, the;
primal principle of all life. Celsus, an ancient
gentleman who was quite an authority ora
the merits and demerits of drugs and laxatives
in his time used to say, “ the best of all
medicines is none,” and gave expression to an
unswerving faith in medical electricity, which
was repeated centuries later by Hoffman in these
words : “ Electricity is the fundamental cause of
all vital motion. Medicine will never progress
until we apply to it the laws of mechanics and
hydraulics.” The temporary cure for cancer to-
day is the knife, which merely prunes the poisonous
roots and makes them grow more rapidly. Who
shall say that cancers will not yet be destroyed,
by plunging into them an electric needle, charged;
with a current of local electricity, sufficiently,
strong to blast the growth of the horrible disease,,
and yet not strong enough to inflict harm,
on the patient. It may be remarked that no-
mechanism could be invented delicate enough,,
to register the varying susceptibilities of;
various subjects, but a recognised in-
stitution of Melbourne, the Bethel Electric:
Medical Baths, 293 Lonsdale-street, gives the;
answer to all that. Patients of extremely various;
strengths, from the child suffering from infantile:
paralysis to the aged Midas who has been mar-
tyred by gout, are treated daily from the great"
batteries, and yet delicate mechanism controlling;
the batteries gives the supplies of life according to>
the strength of each subject. If ever required—
and that contingency will arise from experimen-
tary reasons only—the waters of the baths couldl
be turned into seas of fire; as it is, there is merely
a gentle flow without any perceptible “shook..”’
The method of application is just this : There ar©
three baths, to each of which electricity is supplied
by the mechanism just alluded to. The baths are
made of pure copper, and filled with warm water,
through which a double current of electricity is
circulated. The patient has no contact with any
conductor. He merely reclines on a porous
wooden stretcher with cane supports for the head
and shoulders, and is kept in the bath for from
20 to 45 minutes, just as his fancy or necessity
decide. There are trained attendants of both
sexes for the male and female divisions of the
baths, and the Medical Superintendent, Dr. 11. B.
Wilson, personally regulates the electric charges.
The proprietary do not claim the ability to cure
one disease —they have the baths and know that
the system has cured scores of digestive, circu-
latory, nervous and cutaneous ailments. No
one knows how it is that the combinations
of electrical currents produce such results,
but there are the results—solid facts which
all the talk in creation cannot controvert.
One might say that the Batteries said to the .
Bath’s Co. shareholders “You build the institu-.
tion; give us a little sodium occasionally, and get;
your subjects—we’ll do the rest.” Three years: ;
back a Sandhurst man was found to be suffering
from paralysis of the optic nerve, resulting in M
almost complete blindness. He had 21 baths, andq
is now able to read small print and look at a ,
natural horizon where before his vision was.
bounded by a false horizon formed by the motion-.
less nerve. A 47 years martyr to gout was carried i
to the baths howling with pain—he had 42 bathsj
and can now walk as briskly as a young man..
Another man had been suffering for over-
-30 years with gout. The last two years of i
that period he passid in bed perfectly helpless:.
A course of 36 baths compassed a perfect cum.
A young lady who had been a cripple fronn
rheumatism for six years entered the baths with
one knee three times its normal size through gouty
deposit there. She was under treatment for two
months, and shortly afterwards walked a distance
of six miles. A case of disease of the kidneys
resulted in a cure, after several renal calculi
(stones) had been dislodged and pa c sed, when only
two baths had been taken. The oases of acute
sciatica, lumbago, neuralgia, and ot ovarian and
uterine diseases successfully treated by this cura-
tive are legion, and in one instance of paralysis,.
Where both sphincter muscles were totally power-
less, perfect control was almost immediately
restored. Owing to the fact that the Bethel
Baths, at Melbourne, named after their inventor
and patentee, are the second and last institution,
of their kind in the world, suffering Queens-
landers, Tasmanians, and even New Zea-.
landers come to the Marvellous for treatment.
Already the system of medical electricity
has proved beyond doubt its sterling curative ,
virtues where success depends on the dissolution .
of an internal growth, so will the same force,
under greater tension, destroy the cancerous-;
affections that have killed so many. If neuralgia ,
is the prayer of the nerves for healthy blood, andl
paralysis the protest of overworked muscles, those;
electro motors that are so carelessly impoverished'*
and these two are curable by electricity —if elec-
tricity can give movement to a dead thing, surely
it can arrest the growth of a cancer, or any other
form of parasitic ulcer. The work of electro-
medication, and, above all, that systematised in
the regime of the Bethel Baths, has been wonder-
fully productive of success at the present, and its
certain future position is that of the moit effective
of any of the slayers of disease.

At a recent Dubbo public meeting, when
W. P. Crick referred passingly to Parkes’ vanity
and ambition, a noisy elector interjected—“ What
is your ambition ? ” “To sit still and behave

Parkes boasts that as his train left Castle

Sampson’s eloquent little sermon on
Cardinal Newman, which appeared in the Referee
after Newman’s death, is now accounted for by
the fact that the writer belonged to the R.C.
church. Few people knew it until he came to be

Shires, the snake-man, they say, is making
his will in Bairnsdale, Gippsland. Australia still
remembers how Mr. Drummond, P.M., suicided

one of his own snakes, in Collingwood,
A crank named Guesdon has just died at
Clapham, London, leaving to charities in England,
Tasmania, and Victoria, £300,000. He once had

“ Pendragon ” Sampson became sole pro*
prietor of the Referee on the death of Ashton

' Cunninghame Graham recently visited
Morocco in quest of health, and was well received
until it was found that he was prominently iden-

As they only work two and a-half hours daily in

reactionary.
Diamond Beaney’s funeral was about tho
biggest since Fawkner’s. They say he left
Cromwell House to his housekeeper. If so, ’tis a
mighty big thing, for it is valued at £BO,OOO, and

and all, even apart from the diamonds that may
be lying about perifiiskus.
Lady Hopetoun, at Bendigo, was delighted
to see the hovel in which Lord Salisbury, then
Lord Robert Cecil, lived in 1853. Graham Berry
unearthed the historical fact—though it had been
duly recorded in Therry’s Reminiscences, pub-
lished years before—while hobnobbing with Salis-
bury in a garden-party at Hatfield House.
W. T. Stead takes a flying trip to Australia
shortly, about an Imperial Federation idea,
strictly original and patent. Meanwhile the Re
view of Reviews falls off, and is sadly reminiscent
of the new broom. The idea is that Stead will
leave it, after all, and go for an active political
career, p rhaps aiming at a Radical Premiership.
Some years ago Quong Tart, Sydney’s boss
Chinese, was tendered a banquet locally. Reply-
ing to the toast of his health, lie said : “Some
people tink ’cos a man born in China he a heathen
and savage—might just a well say ’cos Jesa Cly
born in a stable he ahorse.” The soul of Dean
Swift has apparently been reincarnated in Quong.
A daughter of George IV. has been ad-
mitted, ill and destitute, to Camberwell (Eng.)
workhouse. George was about the only King
whose illegitimates were not all ennobled and pro-
vided with big estates. This lady, born four
years before George’s accession, claims, however,
to have been born in wedlock of a German mother.
The second Murrumbidgee member, Rae,
will be one of the shortest, if not the shortest,
man in the N.S.W. Parliament, with the shortest

years. Curiously enough, his colleague, G. R.
Dibbs, is the biggest if not the tallest man in the
Assembly.
Extract from speech by that blithering
idiot, Albert Victor, at a London hospital dinner :
In 1881 ray father presided at this festival dinner, on
whioh occasion an important sura was raised for the funds
of the hospital. In conclusion, I beg to state that my
Royal Majesty her mother, I mean her Royal Majesty my
mother, has given an extra donation of £5O. We will now
drink the institution.
Buchanan styles Labouchere “ the Scapin
of politics Stevenson is “a hide-bound genius in
posse;” Archer, “a saturnine, severe young gent, in
a cheap literai'y suit; ” Andrew Lang, “ a typical
Cockney;” Ibsen, “the dustman of a suburb;”
Zola, “the scavenger of a city.” Buchanan, ac-
cording to his own showing, is the literary
vivisectionist of the day.
THE SAME THING.
S HE: “Who is that?”
H E: “That’s the lover.”
SHE: “I wonder if he’s the real or the stage one!”
The motion for the expulsion of Captain
Verney from the Commons was moved almost
without words. It was seconded by a mere lifting
of the seconder’s hat, and carried without a re-
sponsive “aye.” The House was assisting at the
burial of a reputation. We admire this display
of good taste and frankly admit that no Australian
legislature is yet equal to it.
The late H. M. Murphy, of Melbourne,
was once officially waited on by an ignoramus
who wanted to vote, but couldn’t sign his name,
as required. • “Good heavens, my dear man,”
says Murphy, “did you ever know anybody who
could read the signature of any head of depart-
ment in the Civil Service? Put down any
Egyptian hieroglyphs you like.”
The latest popular expression of the creed
of the party of progress, remarks Francis Adams
in a chatty letter to The Bulletin, is so neat as
to threaten to become historical. It is—“a better
adjustment of the world’s treasure, leisure and
pleasure.” Massingham, late editor of the Star
and present editor of Michael Davitt’s Labour
World, is said to be the author.
Gladstone ill, says our cable. All the
Gladstone family fortune came from the slave-
trade, of which Liverpool was head centre, and in
the time of Gladstone’s father, Sir John, Cooke,
the tragedian, was vinous on the stage one night,
whereupon the Liverpudlians hissed. Cooke ad-
vanced to the footlights and exclaimed, “ Men of
Liverpool! Every brick in your accursed city is
cemented with the blood of a slave. ”
Parkes (thinking to “draw ” H.M. for an
autograph letter) caused a volume of the Federa-
tion Convention proceedings to be arrayed in very
elaborate binding at N.S.W. Government Print-
ing Office, and had it posted in time to reach
Queen Victoria as a birthday present on 24th May.
The Bulletin is not authorised to -predict that
Victoria’s acknowledgement will- be published on
an early date in the daily papers, but it makes the
announcement all the same.
Fitzjanies Stephen leaves behind him, on
the English bench, the reputation of the last (it is
to be hoped the last) of the old style of judge who
swore there was but one criminal Gospel, that of
the Gallows, and the lash was its prophet. Not
to put too fine a point on it, he was a cruel brute,
who delighted in making a fine personal perform-
ance of his trials, playing with the prisoner, like
a cat with a mouse, and then suddenly crushing
him by shouting out an appalling sentence.
Mrs. Lynn Linton is 80 years old. When
she was twenty she ministered to Walter Savage
Landor, and was a Republican. At thirty, she
was Radical. At fifty, a Liberal. At sixty, a
Conservative, At seventy, a Tory, and now she
is a shrieking old reactionary, whose chief object
in life is to vilify her own sex. If she’d died at
forty, when she wrote “Joshua Davidson,” her
name would have been reverenced as that of a
dauntless pioneer. It’s a big mistake to outlive
yourself.
An Australian clergyman nastily and
sneakingly hints in the Guardian —the Anglican
Church organ—that one of the reasons why the
Australian Bishops objected to Canon Barlow’s
consecration to the N.Q. see, was that the vetoers
“had unstated reasons” for a “painful duty.”
This is just the creepy, cowardly, snuffling kind
of meanness that blossoms from narrow sectarian-
ism, and makes a healthy man want to kick the
ordinary parson. Barlow’s life has been an open
book that lias never till now been dogs’-eared by
slander.
Newnes, M.P., is, it is cabled, trying to
float his two paste-and-scissors publications,
London Titbits and the Strand Magazine, into
a limited company, capital £400,000. For chilled-
steel cheek, Newnes is peerless. The profits of
Titbits could be equally shared within two years
by any really smart journalist with one-twentieth
of £400,000 at his command, and a clever advertis-
ing manager to run the business; as for the
Strand Magazine, it dates from but yesterday
and may, for all the world knows, die to-morrow.
Mr. “Jim” Morgan, returned as a labour-
protectionist for the Bogan (N.S.W.), and who is
the sort of man to be returned again, is a native of
Tasmania, and will be remembered by thousands
of Sydneyites as the pleasant-mannered blonde
who, for many years, handled all the money at the
the S.M. Herald advertising-counter. Mr. Mor-
gan was manly enough to throw up a good
position for what he regarded as a principle, and
to go to work with pick and shovel. The Bulletin
is not surprised that the same sterling qualities
which popularised him with the Sydney commer-
cial community have had their effect upon the
Bogan electors.
Many years have elapsed since W. S.
Lyster showed the Melbourne Board of Health
round Melbourne Theatre Royal. Said Mr.
Bulger, of the white waistcoat, “I hear com-
plaints of fleas in this theatre.” “What?”
shrieked the impressario, characteristically tug-
ging his beard, “Gentlemen, I have offered a
reward of five pounds for the first flea caught in
this theatre, and it has not been claimed yet
though I have one hundred employes.” Tha\
settled it, though the Board’s palm itched
as it rested on the red upholstery of the upper-
circle. Meanwhile an employe, hard by, was
stuffing a bandana into his mouth.
Sir Henry (then MrQ Parkes was an eai'ly
insurer with the A.M.P. Society. On Feb. 18,
1852, Henry Parkes, of Sydney, newspaper pro-
prietor, insured for £lOOO. Some of the conditions
of the policy (now obsolete with the A.M.P.)
strike one as funny :
If the said Henry Parkes shall he killed in battle, or
shall go on the sea, unless passing to and fro the colonies
of N.S.W , Victoria, South Australia and Van Diemen’s
Land, in vessels exceeding 50 tons burden, or if the said
Henry Parkes shall die by his own hands, or by duelling,
or by the hands of justice, or from casualty by collision
with the aboriginal natives of any part of New Holland,
or in consequence of injuries sustained in any such colli-
sion . . . then this policy shall be void.
According to a Mr. Capper (who heard the
story from the late Isaac Fletcher, an intimate of
Admiral Smyth who was a friend of Capt. Hardy’s
—pretty roundabout, this) Nelson never spoke a
word after he was struck by the fatal bullet. All
the touching little stories about his sayings
before death are purely apocryphal, so it
is now averred. Such, for instance, as:
“Take care of poor, dear Lady Hamilton,
Hardy ; take care of poor Lady Hamilton. Kiss
me, Hardy,” said he. Hardy knelt down and
kissed his cheek, when Nelson said, “Now I am
satisfied. Thank God, I have done my duty,”
And this: “He said to the chaplain, ‘ Doctor, I
have not been a great sinner; ’ and after a short
pause, ‘ Remember that 1 leave Lady Hamilton,
and my daughter Horatia, as a legacy to my
country.’” Hardy, speaking to Smyth, who re-
peated the conversation to Capper, declared these
all to have been the deliberate inventions of Lady
Hamilton.
A curious error crept into an article which
appeared in our issue of last week descriptive of
the establishment of the Richmond Tobacco Co. at
Newcastle, N.S.W. A portrait of Dr. Harris, who
isgenerallyrecognised as theleading shareholder in
the concern, was, by some means, given as a pre-
sentment of the energetic young manager of the
company, Mr. H. Stoddart. Newcastle folk would
smile when they saw that the latter gentleman
(who is a regular Jacob in this respect) had sud-
denly developed a beard like that of the popular
medico. Apologies all round.

and farmers at wholesale prices.

TEN GOOD REASONS
WHY YOU SHOULD TAKE
WARNER’S SAFE CURE.
1. Because “Warner’s Safe Cure” will save
your life, if you are troubled with any form of
kidney, Liver, or Urinary Disease. 2. Because
“ Warner’s Safe Cure” is guaranteed to do as
represented. It is no new untried remedy, but
has been before the public now more than a decade,
and millions (not thousands) of people have
attested to its virtues. 3. Because “Warner’s
Safe Cure ” contains nothing injurious. The old-
est and youngest can take it with perfect safety.
It has been passed upon by the chemists of the
German Government and allowed to enter that
especially strict country as harmless, a freedom
given to but very few proprietory medicines. 4.
Because “Warner’s Safe Cure ” cures permanent-
ly. Very many medicines bring temporary relief,
while but few make a permanent cure. We have
thousands of testimonials from people who were
cured ten, eight, six and four years ago, and
remain well to-day, 5. Because “ Warner's Safe
Cure” cures kidney disease and all symptoms
thereof, whicharelegion. Medicalauthorities assert
that 93 percent of all diseases which afflict humanity
are the direct result of imperfect kidney action.
The kidneys can be put in repair and made to do
the work nature designed them to do by using
“ Warner’s Safe Cure.” G. Because “Warner’s
Safe Cure ” is the best and safest remedy for the
many disorders from which the gentler sex suffer.
Instruments and violent lotions treat only the
effects, while “ Warner’s Safe Cure’’goes to the
root of the trouble and cures the cause. Why
suffer longer in silence when the means of per-
manent cure is within your grasp? 7. Because
“Warner’s Safe Ciu - e” positively removes the
excess of uric acid and urea which imperfect
kidney action leaves in the blood, and which is
the direct cause of heart disease, apoplexy, rheu-
matism, paralysis, insanity, and kindred death-
dealing results of poisoned blood. 8. Because
“ Warner's Safe Cure ” has a direct action on the
liver, the largest organ of the body, and which
acts in union with the kidneys. It is impossible
to enjoy good health when the liver is diseased.
“Warner’s Safe Cure” will put it in perfect
health. 9. Because “Wi liner's Safe Cure ”is the
only known cure fur Bright’s disease of the
kidneys, which is nothing more nor less than
advanced kidney disease. William Roberts, M.
D., F.R.S., F.R.C.P., the great authority on this
disease, says : —“ The attention of the patient is
awakened some months, or it may be years, after
it (Bright’s disease) has existed, by the gradual
failure of his strength and his increasing pallor or
sallowness and disinclination to exertion. The
disease proceeds silently amid apparent health,
and then suddenly declares itself by a fit of con-
vulsions, deep sleep, nervous blindness, dropsy of
the lungs, or a violent inflammation. Prevent
these terrible afflictions by the free use of
“Warner’s Safe Cure.” 10. Because “Warner’s
Safe Cure ” if taken when you feel out of sorts
and before you develop any special disease, will
remove any trifling difficulty and be money in
your pocket, as it will save your health, which is
the best capital any man or woman can possess,
“Warner’s Safe Cure” is made strictly on
honour. Everything which enters into it is the
best money can buy. Its past success is proof
positive that it is all it is represented to be.

Australia has lost one of its best-advertised
And most remarkable medical men, Mr. J. G.
Beaney, M.L.C., who died at Melbourne last
week, leaving what is understood to be a substan-
tial fortune to be distributed in English and Aus-
tralian charities. He had, so far as is known, no
near relatives, but he owned a large number of
expensive friends and a fine crop of healthy pro-
fessional enemies. He was a man of good medical
instincts, but it was his unbounded push and keen
knowledge of the world (that is to say, his deep
appreciation of the littleness and credulity of
mankind in general) which gave him the enormous
success that he undeniably attained as a money-
making doctor. He began as a chemist’s assistant
in Brighton, England, and (though by that time
legally qualified) followed the same calling when
he first arrived in Victoria; he wound up his
active medical career (it may bo said to have been
terminating gradually for a considerable while
owing to his ill-health) as the doctor who made
more money than any other in Australia barring
one—the Napoleonic-looking and brilliant operat-
ing surgeon J. N. Fitzgerald. Beaney’s practice
was mainly in the way of the Parisian Ricord,
whose barouche, with the well-known piebald
ponies, never stopped before a patient’s door, and
whose coachman was for ever moved on, the Papal
Nuncio once laying a complaint of a stoppage in
front of his mansion.
# * •
Beaney was a showy man, essentially
vulgar—or, let us say, Oriental —in his tastes—a
man of champagne, diamonds and ruby-velvet
dressing-gowns. With him the motto, all through,
was “Show, show, advertise, advertise.” If a
book appeared under his name, you might bet
your life that someone else had written it. He
boasted that he had, 100 times without a failure,
performed the master-operation for hernia—
which, if correct, entitled him to a big reputation
as a clever and lucky surgeon. But he too often
acted as if be were following a trade instead of a
profession. If he performed a lithotomy opera-
tion, the ghastly results were put in the public
window at the medical bookseller’s, and labelled
“Extracted by Dr. Beaney,” whose grateful
patient, cruel to relate, had gone to the cold and
silent tomb. For example, a gigantic calculus,
one of the biggest known, taken from the body of
one Robert Berth, at Melbourne Hospital, was
thus displayed in the window of friend Bailliere,
duly ticketed in the Beaney interest, and it was
in reference to this that what was practically a
charge of manslaughter came to be formulated
against the man of fizz and glitter, whose
enemies alleged that, instead of crushing
the stone—which he might, they urged, have
done after making the incision he, in his
anxiety to secure a prize advertising - speci-
men, deliberately hauled out the big pebble
with the forceps, hopelessly tearing the surgical
wound. At the inquest, Beaney"s end of the log
was brilliantly upheld by J. L. Purves, whose
cross-examination of the opposing doctors was the
most masterly legal effort in the present writer’s
journalistic experience, and it was at the time
favourably compared with Aspinall’s able defence
of Beaney when the latter was tried for
attempting to procure abortion on a St. Kilda
barmaid years previously. On both occasions
Beaney was acquitted.
• « *
However, it was not on account of the
alleged irregularity of much of Beaney’s practice
that his brother Sawbones so bitterly opposed
him. It was on account of his professional money
success and the factors therein —his immense
brass plate, his “ghosted” books, his Imperial
collection of diamonds —auctioned for £3o,ooo—his
unscrupulous and well-creased “ hangers-on ” (the
disclosures in the suit of Bailliere v. Beaney
showed him in his advertising nakedness to the
world), the enormous sums he used to spend when-
ever necessary in securing his election as “ senior
surgeon”— i.e., the surgeon returned at the head
of the poll—to Melbourne Hospital.
• # •
The Doctor, whose various titles were nok
exhausted by twenty letters in the obituary, will
probably not cut up very rich. He was an
extremely generous man, and spent almost as
freely as he received. He had not long inhabited
his expensive Cromwell House, built on dear land
at the Collins and Russell-streets corner, and
some of the current depreciations have told on his
investments. In appearance he was a little
squat, dandy, podgy, Dailey-figured man, who
parted his hair in the middle ; like Dailey, it was
his pride and joy to wear a velvet coat and an
enormous camellia in his buttonhole; his manner
was always that of perfect sang-froid. He is
spoken of by his intimate friends as a man to be
loved for his own sake. Some of the Melbourne
daily papers never lost a chance of flaying him;
but then most of the anti-Beaney diatribes were
written in blood with scalpels, and not by ordi-
nary journalists with office-ink. Beaney’s pro-
fessional kindliness did even more to establish
him in the good graces of the reporters, with
whom he was, at any rate years ago, all powerful,
than his magnums of champagne.
It is said that Dr. Beaney predicted the
time and manner of his death to his housekeeper,
the well-known ‘'Susan” (Miss Treacy), whose
name, by the way, not Susan. Which recalls
how curious Dr. Tracey, Beaney’s now long-
defunct next-door neighbour, was before his death
to know the nature of the vast cancerous mass
found within his body. Also that Cuvier, dying,
called attention to the muscles of his own mouth
as illustrating his favourite theory,
# * *
Dr. Beaney died partly of the Watson-
Kitz case and partly of the Victorian Law Depart-
ment —two diseases and both of them incurable.
He died of the Law Department because it
provides a cold, damp corridor for witnesses to
stand about in, among miscellaneous draughts and
cold breezes and hunks of damp that settle on
their lungs; and he died of the WatsomKitz case
because it was that case which left him standing
among all these malign influences. Truly the evil
that men do lives after them. Old Watson made
money, which was bad ; and then he appointed
trustees to take care of it; and then these trustees,
who wouldn’t have existed if Watson hadn’t made
money, objected to Kitz ; and finally they
summoned Beaney as a witness and left him in a
damp spot as if he had been a frog, and he died as a
consequence,
* # *
Says a cynical correspondent : —“ Cham-
pagne ” Beaney, the “ diamond doctor,” of
Melbourne, has given his last dinner. His
belief in the life-sustaining properties of gold-top
was not warranted by results, or it may be that
his average absorption of the elixir, which he
fixed at two quarts per diem, was somewhat ex-
cessive for a man who took little delight in
muscular exertion. Anyway, he died before his
time, and on Wednesday (Ist) the medical pro-
fesh mustered around Doctor Beaney’s grave in
Melbourne General Cemetery. Much of the exag-
gerated eulogy bestowed upon Beaney by a section
of the local press may be ascribed to his liberality
and fizz. His hand was as free with his money as
with the operating-knife, and his many friends
were outnumbered, until sickness arrested the
flow of income and hospitality, by the host of
toadies, journalistic and otherwise, who advertised
his name. Time was when one couldn’t pick up a
Melbourne paper without discovering some para-
graph or other wherein Beaney figured as a social
or surgical hero. His appetite for notoriety was
insatiable, and as the press, becoming less paro-
chial, gradually dropped the custom of puffing
doctors in general, and Beaney in particular, life
AN ILLUSTRATED FAR ABOUT AN ANXIOUS PA.
ANXIOUS BUT THRIFTY FATHER : “ Doctor, if you can cure him for less than the funeral
expenses, go ahead; but if you can’t, sonny will have to take his chances.”
h
seemed to lose ft good deal of its savour
for this falling star. That Beaney had solid
claims to be considered an “eminent ” surgeon, in
the Lancet sense of the term, is undeniable, for
he could probably have chopped up a dead bullock
with greater rapidity and precision than most of
his Australasian rivals. But it is to be feared
that, like most of the craft, he unnecessarily
sacrificed scores of limbs to his passion for a
“ splendid operation,” whilst the monstrous
charges he exacted from sufferers who were not
rich, or from their relatives who could ill afford
the fee, made it impossible to regard Beaney as
anything of a philanthropist. A surgeon who
wants a gaudy house with a tower to it, unlimited
champagne, diamonds and flatterers, is an even
more mitigated blessing to the community than a
physician of similar tastes. There is little
virtue in robbing honest Peter of a hundred
guineas and his leg, in order that loafer Paul may
be able to borrow a fiver and load himself up with
liquor at his patron’s expense. However, Beaney
was a real good fellow as the world goes, nor any
more of an over-rated humbug than a verdant
doctor-ridden community insisted on making him
in those halcyon days when he was the high-
priest of the butchery trade.
* • •
On his first trial for his life Dr. Beaney
was so poor that he had to mortgage all he had in
the world including his furniture, instruments,
&c., to House, the corn-merchant, of Elizabeth-
street for £lOOO to pay the expenses of his defence.
He was at first defended by Dawson, when the
jury disagreed. At the second hearing Aspinall
appeared for him, and acquittal was the result.
* * *
A parson who ’ started a big religions
revival was discovered Gardinerising some of the
lambs of his fold while the latter were under the
hysterical influence of penitence. The parson was
expelled, and duly went under for some time.
Two or three years later, however, he reappeared
locally as a bright and shining light and a famous
preacher. An acquaintance, who saw his name
advertised in the sermon-columns, went to hear
him preach, and after the service sought him out
and said : “ Well, yon have the most altitudinous
gall I ever noticed. To think that you dare
preach here again I” “My dear brother,
answered the shepherd, quietly, “ the Lord has
forgiven me all my sins, and I should like to pray
with you for your conversion.”
# # *
The wife of a late N.Z. Cabinet Minister
recently called on another Maoriland dame of less
exalted social status to solicit a bazaar-subscrip-
tion. The visitor was very kind and condescend-
ing in her way, and the lady of the house was
properly respectful and gave the fair cadger a
liberal contribution. After pocketing the money
the Ministerial lady became less affable, and on
taking her leave freezingly remarked ; “ You will,
of course, understand, Mrs. Blank, that this is
purely a business visit.” “Oh, don’t mention it,
Mrs. Dash,” said the other; “we are getting
quite used to that sort of thing, now. Why, it
was only this very morning I had another woman-
canvasser here—trying to sell me a medical-work
on female diseases. Just fancy!! Good after-
noon.”
# * •
Bernhardt decidedly did not shine, at the
departure of the Oroya, from Melbourne for
Adelaide. Her beastly big dawg annoyed the
high-toned passengers, and she went about smack-
ing a riding-whip against her gown, and com-
plaining. The sickening thing was the long string
of male sycophants after her, the poodles, while
Government officials vied in their glee over re-
lieving railway porters of her bags. Beauty draws
us by a single hair —-even when it’s put on. You
think, perchance, it is Sara’s hair, but it may be
the hair off a poor red-towheaded French girl,
lying buried in a churchyard of La Bretagne. It
may not be so. There may even be no enamel
in danger of cracking, Peachbloom may grow
naturally on the cheek of budding fifty.
# » »
Now that the Gaiety Company is back in
Melbourne, the Government whip always knows
whereto rush in search of the Ministerial majority
when it is wanted in a close division. All he lias
to do is to gallop round in a cab to the theatre,
and grab the entire contents of the six front rows,
and bring them back with him, and the country is
saved once more.

A keen-looking man had almost completed
all the arrangements for the purchase of a half-
acre block in North Broken Hill, and was just
about to tender a deposit to seal the bargain,
when the would-be seller, who seemed to suddenly
“ suspicionise something,” abruptly asked —“ what
do you propose to use this land for ? ” “To build
a church on.” “ Blash, dank, startler it!” ex-
claimed the negotiating unbeliever, “this bargain’s
off! I ain’t going ter have no church on my
land to ruin the value of the ’jacent property.”

a very pretty little history, indeed.

During the voyaging of a certain burlesque
crowd to these shores, the chief steward had a
pretty rough time with some of the tow-headed
ballet element. One day at dinner he ventured to
request a frowsy frail thing “to try and behave

loud —“Oh, go to h , Jones ! ”

ment —and Mr. Tyson will, whatever the ultimate
issue, have the pleasure of paying all the costs.

A commercial traveller complains in a
letter to the press that Bruce Smith tin; N.S.W.
Minister of Works, who, the other day, in an
otherwise crowded train, had an eight-seat com-
partment all to himself, turned out him, the bag-
man, who now enquires whether B.S. aforesaid
had paid, on the occasion, for eight seats, or one,
or none. The Bulletin, having travelled with
and lived at hotels frequented by “commercials,”
rejoices in having at last discovered one man
capable of resisting a “drummer’s ” rush. Ordin-
arily, when a member of the modest and unassum-
ing guild of bagmen sees a pie, he reaches out his
hand therefor, and then that is his pie in one act.
It would do the Commercial Travellers’ Associa-
tion a whole heap of good to collide with a snag
like Bruce Smith every day for a week.
The Melbourne theatres are rather haunted
of late by a buzzing bevy of lady journalists, who
seem to have taken the drama under their protec-
tion, also to be sweetly persuaded that they bring
cultohaw to the dress-circle, and confer an inesti-
mable benefit upon society every time they sweep
tlie landscape with a glance that signifies—“ You
see I have come.” Some of these disturbing
apparitions betray a marked tendency to come it
too thick —as they say at Toorak —and all along of
the Austral Salon. As the representatives of
sundry local productions boasting a combined cir-
culation of next to nothing worth mentioning,
and congratulatresses of the various managements
upon an everlasting sequence of brilliant suc-
cesses, these erudite females have their humorous
side. Nay, the side they put on would be scream-
ingly funny if it were restricted to the front of
the house and disassociated from the pretentious
imbecility of that darned Salon. The Salon is
becoming too ghastly a joke altogether. A skirted
compiler of tasteless journalistic taffyis harmless
enough whilst she merely smears it over the
columns of the Mqon, Kitchen Cackle, Linger-
ing Death, or what not; besides, the wild,
luxuriant adulation of a female whose hairpins
outnumber her readers is apparently soothing to
theatrical managers, but when she forms a
dowdy picnic party for the purpose of swooping
down behind the scenes and congratulating Sara
Bernhardt on behalf of the Salon, and in the
sacred name of Australian literature, it is time
that James Smith, or some responsible person
like that, dropped the silly sisterhood down a
well-hole to cool. Journalism which is journalism
doesn’t make “ cultchaw ” its war-cry, nor
should it allow what cultchaw it possesses
to be misrepresented by the chattering little
magpies who greeted Sara with a floral
tribute addressed “La Grand Bernhardt.” Those
Salon nymphs who get into theatres on the Press
nod certainly require a lot of looking after. The
necessity for chaining them up betvveen the acts is
extremely urgent. When Sara received that his-
torical wreath on her first night at the Princess’
she naturally imagined that the Salon was an
elementary French class, or an asylum for would-
if-they-could-be people of neglected education.
Or, perhaps, she thought it was Dan O’Connor.
When Sara found, however, that the spokeswomen
of that bogus institution were molesting her in a
‘ ‘ Press ” capacity—well, it was mighty rough on
the trade in general. And this comes, as W, S.
Gilbert would say, of women figuring in two
capacities when they have no capacity at all, but
simply a cast-iron cheek. Not that there is
nothing fresh and enticing about many of their
cheeks. Very nice girls, as a rule, fine, handsome
creatures, if they happen to be no longer girls.
Their figures are ever so much better than their
French, and the depth of meaning in their eyes is
past all understanding. In point of fact, it is a
hard matter to find fault with anything they do,
even though one knows that beauty is only skin-
deep, and women are vain things seeking w hat
they can devour. These last few lines ought to
make ’em feel all right again.

“ Williamson, Garner, and Co.” still

A concert was given last" week by the
young ladies of East Melbourne Presbyterian
College, but not a word was spoken about Miss
Mitchell (Madame Melba) having been trained
by that institution :
Oh no, we never mention her, her name is never heard,
Oar lips are now forbid pronounce that once familiar word.
The clergymen’s committee says, in effect, “We
undertake to make the young Miss Tallowfats
musical dabs, but we also guarantee that they
shall not be qualified so highly as to become stars
of the Paris Grand Opera.” What is the use of a
good thing if you are forbidden to aspire to the
best? Melba is taboo at the College. Rev.
Mungo Malagrowther gets up and congratulates
the principal on the musical progress, but says not
a word about black-sheep Melba. From the Mala-
growther view-point, one would say, “ Why
instruct the girls in music with such fearful
danger?” The reply would be —“We only want
them brought up to the exact standard re pared to
snavel a rich husband.”

Some yet unhanged inventor has offered
to the Victorian Railway department a new and
fiendish invention for closing carriage-doors. In-
stead of the porter rushing along the platform,
and closing each one separately the engine-driver
will turn a handle at the moment of starting, and
bang the whole row simultaneously by steam-
power. And as no one will see him coming it
naturally follows that the infant which is leaning
out will have its fingers squashed, and the fat
woman who is late will be stunned and cast sense-
less on the floor of the carriage, and the last man
will be partially murdered by getting a sGlb door
in his spine just as he is rushing in ; and the train
will start amid the shrieks of the wounded, and
the howls of the dead, and the hysterics of the
survivors, and general ruin, gore, brains and con-
sternation.

Fully one-third of the cases under the new
Victorian Divorce Act are applications from wives
who married under the age of 20—often a good
way under it. There is a woeful sameness about
these cases. The bride was a young lady in a
shop or a factory, with a big bunch of hair dragged
■down over her forehead to make a bang or a fringe
or something, and another big mass of thatch
piled up on the summit of her cranium. The
bridegroom was a leery youth with high heels and
a dog. They met in the street and he whistled at
her. Then they met again and he winked. Then
they got married and had a sticky infant, and a
wooden cottage garnished with time-payment
urniture, and matrimony was a failure.

Au unfortunate foreigner named Ocki has

and subsequently discovered that it bore the
Library stamp. So he promptly took the book
back to the place from whence it came, when the
Library trustees prosecuted him for theft. Asa
matter of course, the foreign gentleman was dis-
charged with the Court’s fullest sympathy, and
the interests of justice were served by both sides
paying their own legal expenses. Ocki didn’t
even get back the trifle he paid for the grammar.

The Victorian Undertakers' Association
held their inaugural bean-feast in one of Mel-
bourne’s multifarious town halls last week. The
outside world was represented by a parson, a
lawyer, a doctor and a chemist —(four representa-
tives of trades that assist to send us to the ceme-
tery before our time) and proceedings were of the
usual gloomily hilarious character. Nothing, in
fact, occurred to interrupt the flow of soul, except
the suggestion, made by a journeyman coffin-
maker, that Sunday funerals should be abolished,
and the mute allowed his Day of Rest, on which
to take out the family and prepare his soul to die.
Whereupon the chairman replied that such a
concession was impossible. Corpses had to be
considered, especially in warm weather, and he
need hardly remind the company that it is often
impossible to keep ’em over Sunday. Then every-
body relapsed into a ruminative sniff and mur-
mured, “ That’s very true.”

An evidently guileless matron wrote to a
London lady’s paper for information on the sub-
ject of soap for the children’s heads, and signed
herself “La Traviata.” Perhaps she, or her
husband, has since discovered the meaning of that
naughty nom-de-plume, which somehow reminds
us of the Sydney C.M.G. who boasted that all his
English relations belonged to the fashionable
demi-monde; also of the Sydney lady-scribe who
signs herself “Faustine.”

Governor Onslow ran out of matches. Entering a

me one box.” And he took his ha-penny change
with the pleased feeling of a man who has nipped
a reckless extravagance in the bud.

If you want to bow to a lady nowadays
the orthodox thing is to remove the hat with
extreme velocity from the cranium, then carry it
quickly down till the back of the hand strikes the
hip, and the hat itself is wobbling among the
owner’s feet. While taking off the tile the
operator breaks off suddenly at the waist, and the
top half of him bobs abruptly forward in a respect-
ful manner. This internal cataclysm is accom-
panied by a smile of recognition. The sudden
jerk forward brings the patient into concussion
with his hat which is just returning from its
expedition, and if the thing is done properly it
hits him on the stomach. Then he looks at it in
a surprised manner as if he didn’t expect to see it
there. Next he upends the hat and glares re-
proachfully at the inside of it as if he thought he
might find soma kittens in it, and there being no
kittens he plants it firmly on his head again,
returns to the perpendicular, and goes away. By
this time the bewchus woman has got round the
Corner into the next street,

A universal provider in London now lends
out a £lOOO Bank of England note to be exhibited
at weddings as the present of the bride’s loving
parent, and makes a big percentage on it. He
also lends out a bogus man-servant, who looks
like the old family retainer, but whose real
business is to die in the last ditch on top of the
mangled remains of the bride and all her friends
and relatives, before he lets any of them make off
with the property. Possibly the note is a bogus
r one after all, though, and the detective who
x wa,tches it is merely put on to give a look of prob-
ability to the proceedings and to swell the bill.
A serious trouble broke out the other day
in a distinguished-looking mansion down by the
sad sea waves, at Brighton (Vic.). Relations had
been strained for a long time, however, and the
explosion wasn’t altogether unexpected. The
owner of the establishment was a tall, elderly in-
dividual with a wisp of moist and weak grey hair
dabbed down in the centre of his head, and his
wife was a large Roman-figured female of 29, with
an aquiline nose; and they had horrid rows daily.
The cause of the rows was the other man—the one
that the lady was supposed to correspond with, but
no one could ever drop on any actual proofs of the
correspondence, till the other day, when the whole
business blew up like kerosene stuffed with thun-
der. There had been the usual row—only a little
worse than usual, and the enraged capitalist went
out and banged the door behind him, and
wandered about cursing. He had a firm convic-
tion that his wife would immediately write to the
other fellow telling him about the trouble, and
lamenting that she was married to a hog, and he
wanted badly to capture the letter and bowl them
both out. And then a great and brilliant idea
struck him. He loafed around till well on in the
afternoon, and then he went and waited in the
dusk outside the other fellow’s house. The post-
man wasn’t due till 5.30, and by that time it was
very nearly dark. When the official loomed up in
the distance, the watcher opened the gate and
stole softly up the path on to the other fellow’s
verandah, and composed himself in an easy,
familiar attitude against a pillar. He was smok-
ing a cigar and looked quite at home, and when he
held out his hand for the letters, the whole of the
other fellow’s correspondence was shoved into it
without the slightest hesitation. He pocketed
the lot and fled, and just as he was going through
the gate the other fellow sighted him and the post-
man from the window and realised that every-
thing was up. And so it was, for two minutes
later the elderly husband had read his wife’s letter,
and about six seconds after that he had rushed
home and shoved the Roman-looking female down
the front steps.

As an amorous Rockhampton railway
official was lurching homewards “ under the

discovery that a lady was beckoning to him from
a verandah. Nothing loth, he boldly opened a
front gate and marched on to the premises, where
he started to enact the “ balcony scene ” with the
unknown Juliet. Getting no response from his
idol (literally), he rushed frantically on to the
verandah and clasped in his arms —the wooden
figurehead of a wrecked vessel, which image the
housefather had fixed up on his verandah. The
disgusted Romeo gave Juliet a sling over his

The case against the Melbourne abor-
tionist, Ellen Taylor, possessed some remarkable
features. The evidence against her consisted
entirely of a statement made by-in fact, almost
wrung from —the deceased woman Carter, during
an agony of suffering, her sedative doses of
morphia having been stopped “on purpose to make
her mind clear.” The medical attendant and con-
stable who procured Mrs. Carter’s dying state-
ment, appear to have entered upon their hideous
task con amove. The dying woman was shrieking
for chloroform, and, according to Barrister Purves
(vide Age report):—
The doctor told her she ought to make a statement and
that, if she did, he would give her chloroform.
The possible inference being that, if she
didn’t, she might scream away in vain
for the anaesthetic. From the Age’s re-
port of the cross-examination we quote—
“ Neither of the doctors found any indications
that instruments had been used before the illness
from which Mrs. Carter died came on, and one of
them added that all the appearances were con-
sistent with there having been a natural abortion.”
Mr. Purves, Q.C., very properly objected to the
Court hanging a woman on the uncorroborated
statement of a person who, if that statement were
correct, was an accomplice, and this point of law
was reserved, though Judge A’Beokett meanwhile
sentenced the moaning wretch to be hanged. The
jury acted in keeping with the other eccentricities
of the case. It found Mrs, Taylor guilty of
“ wilful murder,” but recommended her to mercy.
“On what ground ?” asked his Honor. Foreman :
“Because we do not think it was wilful. ”
Round the Shops and Shows.
Trying weather such as we have experi-
enced for the last three weeks induces one to look
out for a kind of clothing that will counterbalance
the effects on the body of the winterly season.
Wonderfully adapted for this purpose are the
various garments produced under Dr. Jaeger’s
sanitary woollen system, which is nothing short of
a perfect reform in clothing, the essentials being
pure wool, and only pure wool, instead of the
commonly adulterated merino garments, and, the
texture being porous, it allows the skin to breathe
and to thoroughly perform its functions. The
representative of the Company, whose head-
quarters for Australasia are in Wynyard-street, is
always ready to explain to ladies and gentlemen
the interesting details of this system, though—
and this should always be kept in mind—the busi-
ness is conducted strictly upon wholesale lines,
and purchases can only be made at the leading
retail houses in the city. From what the
representative says, combinations in every
form and texture are the leading line of
the establishment, and certainly they must be
popular with the ladies at home, considering that
the company sell thousands of dozens every season.
But, for those who still hesitate to adopt the com-
binations, there are other garments in endless
variety. Ladies vests in numberless styles ; a
great variety of drawers and chemises ; there are
nightdresses, amongst which is the State nightdress,
a garment richly embroidered and trimmed with
handsome lace. Surprising is the extensive range
of garments for children —nine different lines of
girls combinations being kept in stock, and every
line in seven different sizes, so that every age can
be fitted. It appears that special attention has
been bestowed on this department and we can
only wish for the sake of our “ little ones” that
this system of clothing will be well patronised
by the mothers, for there cannot be any doubt
that it is far healthier for the children to wear
pure wool next the body than cold, clammy linen.
Until very recently there was a great difficulty in
obtaining pure woollen garments, especially in the
smaller sizes. The genuine make of these goods
is easily identified ; every article bears a diamond-
shaped tradesmark, enclosing the portrait of that
celebrated German savant, Dr, Jaeger.

has been besieged at mid-day by hungry shoppers,
who by no means fail to do full justice to the
capital fare provided for the price of one shilling
upward !

Sir, —Will you, through your widely-circulated

fact that “ Tattersall George Adams ” has disposed
of the whole or part of his interest in the well-
known Tattersall’s sweep, and that it is now

It is interesting to the photographic world
to know that Messrs. Baker and Rouse, of Mel-

the business of Messrs. Lichtner and Co., photo-

facilities at their command to cater to the wants
of the New South Wales professional and amateur
photographic community, they have removed to
more central and commodious premises situated at
373 George-street, next Australian Joint Stock
Bank. It is their intention to combine the pre-
sent business with that of optical lantern goods,
and they are now showing a splendid assortment of
lantern-slides, plain and coloured, optical lanterns,
and all requisites, and the whole stock, consisting,
as it does, of all the latest and most modern
ideas in photography, is displayed to great
advantage, and is rvell worthy a visit of
inspection. It is worthy of note that Messrs.
Baker and Rouse, apart from their regular ship-
ments by every mail steamer, have at their com-
mand the large manufactory of Messrs. T. Baker
and Co., at Abbotsford, Melbourne, where they
are now making dry plates, opal and lantern
plates, bromide, platinotype and sensitised papers,
pure nitrate of silver, chloride of gold, ana all
sundries, including mounts of every description.
The firm, having establishments in all the Austra-
lian colonies, are in a position second to none in
supplying the requirements of the profession, and
have erected on the premises a dark-room for the
convenience of amateurs. Messrs. Baker and
Rouse are just issuing a new and illustrated
catalogue, which will be w T ell worthy of perusal,
and are sparing no pains to make their Sydney
house as complete as possible, and we cordially
wish thenq success in their enterprise.

About the latest report from Mr. John L. Sulli-
van is that he is going to light Slavic for any money on
ear tl,—as soon as lie gets back from Australia. It is one
of the saddest features of Sullivan’s latter years that ho
Ins always been going to do something tremendous as
soon as he got back from some place a long distance off.
Therefore, in order to bring the big pugilist to the scratch,
t ie writer of this paragraph will whack him himself at
the earliest possible moment after he gets hack from the
source of the Nile ; and if Sullivan declines to meet him
—when he returns from that river—he will bang him
informally in the public thoroughfare. He won’t bang
him before he goes away because he can’t spare the time,
but he would as soon do it as not, only he is too busy
p veking his carpet-bag.
* * *
Tiie cable states that directly Slavin reached
Queenstown ho struck the attitude which Ajax assumed
towards the lightning and announced his anxiety to fight
Sullivan tor all the money on earth. Meanwhile, the
exploded slugger.was peacefully making the best of his
way hither in the capacity of hactor. At present we dre
pmting td hear Sullivan declare* at the wily suggestion
of his business managers, that the dream of his life is to
meet Slavin (who appears to be training in Paris at the
gay Mabille, or somewhere like that) for ten millions
a side and the skite championship.

The Walhalla miner who brought an action
against a former chum for half the first prize in Adams’
sweep on the Carbine Cup, has obtained a verdict with
costs. Seeing that expensive gentlemen like Purves were
retained in the case, there isn’t likely to be much prize
left for the other miner, whose main point of defence was
the alleged illegality of sweeps. A Victorian judge
decided that the plea didn’t hold good, inasmuch as
sweeps were legal in N.S.W. (Wka-a-t!), and the Victorian
Police Offence? Act could not be infringed outside the
colony. The case has been a large, gratuitous advt. for
Adams.

When politician J. D. Young ran the pub. at
the corner of King and George streets, Sydney, a man
employed there turned “rusty” one day, when J.D.
waded in and gave him “ the father of a dressing.” Next
day the man went up to Larry Foley’s White Horse and
asked for a job. He was pretty badly marked, and Larry
asked him how he had received his punishment. Upon
hearing the cailse Larry said, in all seriousness, “if you
would turn on a big man like Mr. Young, what would you
do with a little fellow like me ? No use for you to-day,
thanks.”

By cable we learn that Jack Slavin has defeated

An article on kangaroo-hunting appears in the
current number of Scribner’s Magazine. There are some
fine things in it The writer mentions that a kangaroo
will sometimes rip up a dog with “a single stroke of his
hind hoof.” We have heard a new-chum speak of a work-
ing-bullock’s fore-paw—a kangaroo’s hoof is, we presume,
about the same style of thing. The article also says that
a kangaroo will sometimes “ leap upon a horse’s haunches,
seize the rider about the neck from behind, and drag him
from his seat, and then woe betide the unfortunate wretch
for his chances are small indeed.” Good iron 1 We would
fike to see a picture of this. One of the illustrations
shows an old-man kangaroo standing under a fern-tree,
but the American editors have evidently reckoned that a
fern-tree is an impossibility, so they have put it “flr"-
tree in the letterpress. The writer records that he let an
old doe kangaroo have both barrels of a breechloader, No.
3 shot, full in the flank at 20 yards’ distance, and she
never even faltered in her course. One feels inclined to
echo Punch’s small boy—“ Yah, never hit it!” At 20
yards, No. 3 shot from a decent gun would admit
sunlight to the innards of a pig, let alone a soft-
skinned animal like a kangaroo. He also says that it
gave four men all they could do to struggle home under
the weight of the skin and tail of one kangaroo—adding
that they managed it by relieving one another occasion-
ally. This man should come out and relieve our champion
liar.

“Hidalgo,”a well-known American turf-writer,j

that suitable land advanced to prohibitory prices.

Gladstone has lost his eldest son. Twenty
years ago he brought this young man into politics,
just when Russell introduced his bright son, Lord
Amberley. Young Gladstone did not hit, and
retired, leaving the field for Herbert, to come
later, and he, too, is sapless. Amberley was clever,
but not political, and died young, after startling
the world with a heterodox book, in which his
able and sympathetic wife co-operated. FeW
statesmen’s sons tiirn out like Pitt after Chatham,
and Burke underwent the same disappointment as
Gladstone and Russell.
That enthusiastic scientist, the late Gerard
Krefft, of the Australian Museum, went to a
berth, which he had reserved on the Newcastle
(N.S.W.) steamer, and found therein a hulking
person stretched at full length. “Excuse me,
sir,’’said Gerard with all politeness, “but you are
occupying, in mistake, the berth which I had
taken.” “You can have it,” growled the other,
a surly brute, “if you are a good enough man to
take it from me.” Krefft, unwilling to engage in
personal combat on British lines, said: “You
will, I am sure, at least do me one favour, sir—
please hand me my bag of snakes, which you will
find at your head.” The bunk was soon vacant.
It is related with much gusto that while
X, an Australian statesman, was recovering from
an accident, some good-natured friends hired for
his use, at a livery-stable, a two-horse barouche at
an expense to themselves of £6 weekly, and placed
same at his disposal. X. continued using the
barouche for months and months, and they,
feeling the expense, endeavoured to diplomatically
substitute for the two-horse vehicle, a one-horse
victoria, which they hired at another stable.
Presently one of them saw X, and remarked that
they hoped he liked the victoria. “No,” replied
the old ’un, “ I much prefer the barouche, and
have continued using it,” “ And what have you
done with the Victoria?” they asked. “Oh,’’
calmly said he, “ I handed that over to Lady X.’’
Henniker Heaton is coming to Australia
before Christmas. By the way, we read in the
Journalist that at the annual dinner of London
Press Club, Mr. T. M‘Rendle proposed “ The
Visitors,” amongst whom was ye Henniker, and
related how, on a visit to Canterbury (Eng.) he
went into a Post-office and asked the postmaster
what sort of a member the town had. The post-
master replied that he had only one objection to
the hon. gentleman—that whenever he sent a
telegram from the office he wanted his name to go
as one word, and he would not send it. From
that day his (the speaker’s) estimation of the
postal-servants had appreciably risen. He thought
that a man who went in cold blood to a district
post-office, and then and there demanded, without
notice, that the postmaster should telegraph a
long, double-barrelled name such as “ Henniker
Heaton ” for one half-penny was, no doubt un-
wittingly, trying to commit a fraud on his native
land.
The N.S.W. Bush Missionary Society
wants funds. Reading this we recall the first
Australian bush-missionary whose acquaintance
it was our honour to make —at Charters Towers,
many years ago. After dinner, one very cold
evening, a white-haired old gentleman—a tremen-
dous knife-and-fork man, who had been our
vis-a-vis at dinner—was sitting with a number of
miners before the hotel fire. One of this old
gentleman’s many harmless peculiarities was
gradually discovered by the company —he
“shouted” for himself only. Said he to the
waiter : “ Patsy, bring me—aw—some of that —
aw—aw —best rum of yours ; ‘Red-heart,’ I think
you call it.” Yes, the Rev, J. J. Westwood
merely “thought” they called it “Red-heart.”
He didn’t know, you see, for certain. Blessed
are the innocent, for they shall be Australian
bush-missionaries.

forty years I have been a sufferer from rheu-
matism, and latterly in the most aggravated form,
often having acute attacks which made me almost
helpless for days, insomuch that it was with the
greatest pain and difficulty that I could move
about at all, and only able to get up stairs on my
hands and knees. A friend who had tried the
“Microbe Killer” with beneficial results sent me
a jar of the medicine, which I took, and I have
now taken three jars of “Microbe Killer” and
the result has been a great wonder to myself and
my friends, for now I can get about freely, with-
out pain. Igo up and down stairs without any
trouble, and I am greatly improved in health
every way. In fact my suffering from rheumatism
seems a thing of the past, and I can recommend
the “ Microbe Killer ” to anyone with confidence,
knowing what it has done for me. Several have
tried your medicine on my recommendation for
other diseases —and one a cancer patient —with
the same beneficial results. —Yours respectfully,
MRS. WHITAKER.

appears in public, now-a-days, he or she generally

At Cooma, N.S.W, the Salvation Harmy
held a wake on an effigy of Beelzebub, the text
being “The Devil is dead.” Candles at head and
foot, “ keening ” and prayers —everything except
the whisky and the lies about the corpse’s former
good qualities when living.
Queensland Coalition Government will not
introduce one-man-one-vote, which Griffith says
he supports, but which MTlwraith denounces.
The French system of second ballot will probably
be offered as a cure by the Coalition. Without
one-man-one-vote there would be no cure. Out
the Coalition must go.
Parkes has not for twenty years Minister!'
ally occupied so galling a position. Instead of hi s
usual team of servile noodles, he has in what by
courtesy is called “his” Ministry, some strong
men who will not be brow-beaten. And, instead
of being able to carelessly drag along at his heels
by one string 70 or 80 docile dullards, with rings
through their noses, he has to deal with scores of
independent private members having opinions of
their own.
Governor Kintore circularised the pro-
minent Adelaide butchers, asking them to tender
for the honor of Government House meat custom.
At scheduled rates, we suppose ? One butcher
replied by a polite memo., stating that he “ never
tendered for the supply of gentlemen’s houses.”
Another, it is whispered, offered to serve the
vice-regal household gratis, provided “my missis
has the right of private entry to all the swell
parties and 1 e-vees.”
Quong Tart, Sydney’s representative
Chinese, gave a christening-party, and to it were
bidden, among many others, old Sir John Robert-
son and his young friend, Tom Slattery, M.L.A.
When the clergyman began the service, the grey-
haired old Jack reverentially went right down on
his marrow-bones, and, bending his head, remained
in that uncomfortable attitude until he felt
thoroughly tired. Looking up, he observed that
Thomas, in an endeavour to make the best of
both worlds, was “only half kneeling down”—
i.e., he was on one knee and was resting his elbow
on his bent leg while the clergyman got through
his interminable task. Jack hereupon picked up
his big walking-staff, which was lying near, and
brought it down smartly on Mr. Tom Slattery’s
skull. The latter winced severely, rubbed his
head, and said nothing, but when the service was
finished he complained and said : “Sir John, you
hurt me very much indeed.” “Well, I meant
to, you infernal rascal,” snorted old Jack—“ you
came here to a religious ceremony, and if you
haven’t the blankity-blank good grace to san-
guinary well go down on your adjective marrow-
bones you deserve to have your carmine head pro-
perly stove in.”

CORRESPONDENCE
‘ Thiggum ”: Card. Moran’s position is under-
stood to be that, until the two Irish parties make it Up, he
will not lend his influence on behalf of either.... “A. J.
Curlewis ”: The locomotive-driver’s pay is not a great
“catch” when you come to consider that the fact of being
a locomotive-drivel - usually takes ten years off the life of
a strong man. The driver who doesn’t succumb to some
spinal or cardiac disease caused by constant oscillation
gets broken up before his time by rheumatism or some
chest-disease “A.N.8.”: As the Australian Gas Co.
will now have a shockingly poor show' of getting their
Electric Lighting Bill through the N.S.W. Assembly, the
matter is hardly worth discussing in that form...
“ Mephist ” (Uralla): As the fiscal question was practically
sunk at the N.S.W. general elections it is easily con-
ceivable that the electors held up their hands for both
Copeland and Lonsdale, both good men, no doubt
“F. 0.” (Orange):-Your par. from local paper received.
Look up our answer and emphasise the words “on
a property franchise,” If one-man-one-vote also
applied to Upper Houses, the answer would have
to be different. But that w r ould also open Up
debate on Unicameral v. Bicameral systems .....
“W. Craig”: Yes, a charge was made for admission to
the consecration in question. For the matter of that we
have often heard of charges being made on such occa-
sions “P.W.” (Taree) : Thanks “J. Evans”: Very
neat “ G.M.C.”: Have read alleged verses and are now
confronted by two mysteries : To what school of politics,
and to w'hat school of poetry, do you be10ng,?....
“ J.D.8.”: Sickening....“ The Cleverest Man,” &c.: Will
read “ E.W.H.” (M.L.); Your yarns are far too long-
winded “Billy M.”: Thanks, but cannot well use it.
.... “Ora ”; Labour members of Parliament have indeed
been failures in the past, but then they had no chance of
acting independently, as they w r ere not paid. How could
a man do honest parliamentary Work whilst hustling for
a living? “G. Sibley”: Thanks for cutting, When
we coupled the name of Gordon with that of Browning we
were thinking of Browning’s “Ride to Ghent.”
“Parson”: Thanks.. .“A. W. James”: Bulletin lacks
space to give itself much marmalade “ A.L.”: It takes
£54,000 per annum to pay the Speaker, the Chairman of
Committees and the other 141 members of the N.S.W.
Assembly. The Parliamentary Public Works Committee
is an additional expense “A Naughty Tory”: Will
print shortly “ J.R.” (Fitzroy): Thanks, but it’s a pity
you don’t found your artistic labours on better jokes ...
“F.G.F.” (Melb.) : “ Passing him on ” is like your last-
over long. Why don’t you cut them down by half?
“ J.M.8.” (A.): Will read carefully.... “G.S.C.”: To hand.
....“Max J.”: You don’t give the title of the MS
“G.H.”: To hand .. “W.R. M‘R.” : Many thanks
“ D. O’C.” : Thanks “ LA.” : You speak of “ a certain
lady.” Now, you can never be quite certain about any
lady “ Ibus ” (Pyramid): A “ born criminal ” —as per
clipping—has really no special characteristics. Dailey
once said: “Place the most honest and pleasing face
behind these rails (of the dock) and it at once becomes a
face that expresses every passion.” The typical Madonna
would, in the eyes of the world, be a typical deceitful
poisoner if you put her into the dock. The Judge would
look a typical scoundrel if you stripped him of his wig
and put him behind the spikes, and the habitual felon
would look every inch a Judge if you put him into a wig
and gown and placed him in the Judge’s vacant seat with
a clean shave. The world always cheers for the top dog,
and much of the success The Bulletin has attained pro-
ceeds from the fact that it has howled loudly for
the pup that was undermost in the fight
“L.L.”: The fact is, the Prince of Wales ought to have
been educated for the Church, on the English family
principle “Boomerang”: To hand; thanks..
“P.J.F.”: Already noticed. Thanks “Knee-fight”:
Yes, from the Observer report it would really appear
that the magistrates also were drunk. Thanks for items.
“ W.G.P.” (A.): Thanks... . “ Quitaquat”: You
should make private letters of your articles and articles
of your private letters “Spartan”: There is nothing
illegal in it, but it might cause trouble. You should, for
instance, give notice of it to the life-assurance Co. In
settling a claim the company don’t worry about what you
were christened- so far as that goes they only ask them-
selves—Was deceased the man who assured with us?
“James H.” (8., Q.): The “testimonial” dodge has
been so often resorted to that it is now stale “Frank
Tyson”: Will read “J. Twiss”: All we can say is—
“ High interest means had security.” “E.L.” (W.);
Victoria is the only Australian colony—excepting new-
fledged W.A.—that insists upon a property-qualification
for its Upper House membership. No Victorian can be
an M.L.C. unless he owns freehold property to the value
of £lOO per annum “Or”: It maybe assumed that
the £4O was his own money, since it is highly improbable
that anyone would have been fool enough to lend him so
much “A. 0.”: G. D. Carter’s idea is clear. He got
it—pardon our modesty—from The Bulletin. .. “ J.H.G.”
(St. K.): Received “Polypi”: We don’t think so
“ D.8.D.” (B.): Such things have been noticed in Bulle-
tin “ J. M‘N. (Vic.): All we know about it is this —
that it is a genuine paid-for advertisement “ Sazerac” :
No time to write suggesting subjects. Easier to write
than to suggest subjects “Alfred (Lawn.) Tennison” :
To hand... “The Crow Eater”: Sorry for overlooking
your copy. But please send something more Australian
... “ J.0.W.” (O.): Thanks “J.C.G.”: Your verse is
gorgeous bosh. “Court” and “thought” don’t rhyme.
What do you mean by this ?
“ But the vagaries of a drowsy child
Whose thoughts and wishes romp all to wild.”
You have even worse lines, however “Musicus”: Of
course, copies of pieces of music can be multiplied by
transference, just as any other kind of inked marks may
he reproduced.. . “W.G.” (Adelaide); Too melancholy
“ A.S.B.”(Dept. of Lands): A wins; the speaker
must be looking at his son’s portrait. If you don’t
believe this, get the case argued out before the Full
Court—or send it to the Privy Council “ A.8.C.” (Bar-
caldine) : In 1888 there were 16,800 Chinamen in N.S.W.
and 12,560 in Victoria. [Many replies held over.]
Jack Gardiner M.L.A. proposes to tax the
gate-money at Victorian football matches “ as it
were.” This should lose him his seat. R.I.P.
Premier Griffith will bring in “a Bill to
provide for the submission of the Constitution of
the Commonwealth of Australia as adopted by
the National Australasian Convention held at
Sydney in March and April, 1891, for the con-
sideration of the people of Queensland.” Griffith
has taken warning by Parkes’ fate, and sends the
Bill to “ the people.”
In an election for Evelyn (Vic.), many
years ago, no less than three candidates were suc-
cessively returned, each of whom became insolvent
ere he had been many weeks in the House. The
next member was Gatty-Jones, a well-known
solicitor, who on the hustings was implored by
the crowd not to “go broke”for.at least a month.
Jones did not become insolvent, but he was thrown
front his buggy, broke his leg, and did not take
his seat for months.

The only really successful prevent-
ive and cure of pimples, blotches,
blackheads, red, rough, and oily skin,
and most complexional disfigurations,
is that greatest of all Skin Purifiers
and Beautifiers, the celebrated Cuti-
cura Soap. For irritating and scaly
humors of the scalp, with dry or fall-
ing hair, red, rough hands, chaps,
painful finger ends with shapeless
nails, and simple humors of the skin
and scalp of infancy and childhood, it
is simply infallible.
CUTICURA SOAP
A marvellous beautifier of world-wide celebrity, CuticurA Soap is simply incom-
parable as a Skin-Purifying Soap, unequalled for the Toilet, and without a rival for
the Nursery. Absolutely pure, delicately medicated, exquisitely perfumed, it produces
the whitest, clearest skin, and softest hands, and prevents inflammation and clogging
of the pores, the cause of pimples, blotches, blackheads, red and oily skin, and most
complexional disfigurations. It derives its remarkable medicinal properties from
CuticurA, the great skin cure, but so delicately are they blended with the purest of
toilet and nursery soap stocks that the result is a medicated toilet soap incomparably
superior to all other skin and complexion soaps, while rivalling in delicacy and sur-
passing in purity the most noted and expensive of toilet and nursery soaps. For the
prevention of facial blemishes, for giving a brilliancy and freshness to the com-
plexion, and for cleansing the scalp and invigorating the hair, it is without a P e -r,
Sale greater than the combined sales of all other skin soaps. Sold everywhere. 25c.

The other day a man, obviously in great
pain and almost incapable of speech, came before
a Sydney S.M. charged with indecent language.
He explained that his jaw had been broken by
the arresting policeman. The magistrate calmly
remanded him to gaol for a week, refusing
tendered bail 1 On that day week he was again
brought up, when the police evidence having been
heard, the charge was at once dismissed by
another stipendiary. What has the Minister for
Justice to say to a functionary who commits to
gaol, under such circumstances, on a trivial charge,
a citizen who offers bail? The judicial eccentrici-
ties of this police-magistrate are beginning to
arouse much attention.

The result of the Upper Hunter (N.S.W.)
election is a big joke against that much-advertised
squatter, W. E, Abbott, who must have written
hundreds of letters within the last few months
to the town and country press in his self-
chosen crusade against “wicked agitators.”
These lengthy epistles seemed to pop up
simultaneously everywhere in the city and
country papers; in fact, W.E.A.’s pen was
übiquitous. His yarn was always the same old
yarn—that the heart of the people was dead
against the labour-agitators, and that he was the
impersonation of their real Codlin. A low, com-
mon, vulgar agitator named Williams —a shearer,
a shearer’s cook, a rouseabout, a fencer and
splitter, a horsebreaker, an all-round bushman —
took up Abbott’s challenge, and to almost every
letter of the latter appeared a vigorous reply over
the signature of T. H. Williams. The scorn of
W.E.A. was magnificent; his prophecies of how
the people would “show this man” were
numerous. Now, he, the lordly Mr. Abbott,
has the pleasure of handing over to the
mere worker his free railway-pass. Even at
Abbott’s own door the labour man polled
within 14 votes of the great squatting father to
his people. But Williams had to work hard for
it, and in the late terrible weather and in a dis-
trict veined with creeks, this was no small feat.
Here is a record :—At Stewartbrook on a Satur-
day night addressing a meeting ; away on horse-
back for 40 miles with 44 swollen crossings of
sinuous streams to swim, raining hard, to Scone,
where he rested on Sunday night; on Monday to
Aberdeen to address a meeting, and back to
Scone; on Tuesday to Merriwa (50 miles), and
then on to Cassilis for the polling-day; back after
the close of the poll to Scone—7B miles ! The
country needs men of such grit among its represen-
tatives.
Use Batho’s Baking Powder.
Dr. Neild, of Melbourne, delivered a lec-
ture recently on the general habit of taking too
much medicine, and, in the course of his remarks,
he admitted that he had probably killed a good
many patients during his career while groping
with a bottle and a blister among their innards in
search of some complaint that probably wasn’t
there. No doubt he has —every doctor has. The
worst feature in the profession is that whenever
the physician meets some new and astonishing
case which he can’t fathom he has, nevertheless,
to look as if he knew all about it, and plunge
wildly at the disease with a quart of evil-smelling
medicine. If he admits that he doesn’t under-
stand it, the patient will go off to some other
doctor who doesn’t understand it either, but who
says he does. Therefore, the only thing to do is
to seize a piece of paper and write the customary
dog-Latin paragraph, which runs something like
this; “Hyd. Car., 11. B.Z. Slush gr. 111. Pot
Gulph X 3 Dash Blast B 3 gr. Hyd. Cuss % & lod.
Slop 3",” and softly clean the patient out of two
pounds two shillings. And then when he drinks
it all, and comes back feeling worse, the correct
caper is to look at the outside of his chest through
a bit of stove-pipe with a frill on it, or to gaze at
his back through an ear-trumpet, and then the
physician looks as if he was staggered by the in-
formation he has acquired, though he has only
seen the patient’s skin and a fly walking on it;
and he feebly writes something in a book and
charges some more. Most doctors hesitate about
telling the patient what is the matter with him,
and this proceeding is described as “ professional
reticence. ’ The cause of it is that in about 20 per
cent, of the cases there is nothing the matter at
all; and in 40 per cent, more the patient has pub
the’doctor off the track by sheer lying; and in
about 20 more the M.D. can’t explain, through
sheer ignorance. And, anyhow, about half the
patients never stump-up, and when the matter
lies between a doctor who doesn’t know and a
patient who doesn’t pay things are about even.

When, in the seventh year of the reign of
His Most Gracious Majesty, that superlative
blackguard, George IV., his bosom friend, the
Most Noble the Marquis of Sligo, sold the bril-
liant racehorse, Skeleton, to Prince Esterhazy—
lie who, according to that veracious chronicler,
Mr. Barney Maguire, was on a certain distin-
guished occasion, “All joo’ls from his jasey to his
di’mond boots,” the aristocratic and riff-raff cir-
cles of the United Kingdom, expressed surprise;
judge, then, of the feelings which were excited
among the same distinguished sections of British
Society when the news spread, within a month or
two, that the Prince had disposed of him to an in-
significant colonist of Botany Bay. Eminent
though Mr. Alexander Riley’s position was in
Sydney as a merchant and a grazier, he was of
little note, indeed, we may say, of no note at all
in his native land ; and that he should have had
the audacity to negotiate and to complete success-
fully the purchase of that noble grey stallion
whose turf career had been of exceptional lustre
was little short of appalling. How dare . a
mere colonist, a huckster of rum and so forth,
rob England of one of her brightest equine
ornaments ? And how amazing was it that Prince
Esterhazy should have been so little considerate
of what was due to the prestige of the nation
which had so hospitably entertained him, in con-
senting to a transaction of the kind ! Neverthe-
less, the remonstrances expressed in Bell’s
Weekly Messenger, the Times, the Morning
Chronicle, and notably by “ Nimrod ” Apperley,
in his turf gossip, were without avail, and Skele-
ton was duly shipped to Port Jackson. Apperley
might fume and fret bitterly over the loss to
English racing stock of this notable stallion (and
that he did so take it to heart we heard from his
son, when he was stationed in Sydney in the early
Fifties buying horses for the Honorable East
India Company’s Service), but the sentiments of
the distinguished sporting writer kicked the beam
when weighed in the balance against Mr. A,
Riley’s golden guineas. Even princes get hard-up.
# * #
To say that horsey and sporting opinion in
the colony reached the pinnacle of excitement on
the announcement being made public that Skele-
ton, the famous Irish performer, was actually
includ d in Botany Bay’s population, is to under-
state the case. Every man who had the least pre-
tensions to equine knowledge went wild over the
news.
Now they were going to have some sport !
Now, the national pastime of England was to
have a chance of becoming properly implanted in
Australian soil ! Now, would the young bloods
of the colony be able to emulate the praiseworthy
examples of the scions of the Home aristocracy
and gentry, and own, and be ruined by, pedigree
stock! There had been, of course, in the forty
years of the colony’s existence, some attempts to
base upon the popular belief that racing improves
the breed of horses, an annual meeting or two.
Sydney, Windsor, and Campbelltown all had their
periodical contest, and matches for purses, more
or less heavy, were by no means infrequent. Still,
these prior attempts at the introduction of the
noble pastime into the new world had not been
characterised by remarkable success. Connoisseurs
had been at no loss to explain the fact by the
absence of any sire of notable qualities and per-
formances —the “ stables” were, in short, possessed
only of weeds.
Now, all this was to be changed. Skeleton was
going to call into existence a very different state
of things, and visions were glowing and hopes ran
high, of close matches, remarkable finishes,
magnificent fields, and all the rest of the accessories
to turfites’ pleasures. From Government House
and the Bent-street Club to the low pot-houses
and convicts’ huts, the intelligence of Skeleton’s
arrival stirred the hearts and imaginations of the
people. The Rileys had done big things for the
country—one of the things was building the Rum
Hospital—but the general consensus of opinion
was that the purchase of Skeleton was about the
biggest. That was in the first flush; then, very
unaccountably, so it seemed, feeling grew less
buoyant.
» * «
The following conversation, if reported,
Would have explained the change :
“ I say, Warphy,” said Flicker, of the Lands
and Survey, in the smoking-room of the club one
day a week after Skeleton’s landing, “have you
seen that new importation of the Rileys ?”
“What, the grey stallion ? Faith, I have, and
I don’t think old Alexander ever made a better
bargain, either for himself or for this portion of
His Majesty’s Dominions, than that same, if all I
hear about his performances is true.”
Mr. Robert Jenkins, a young cattle-breeder and
a famous memoriser of pedigrees and perform-
ances, here entered the room, and caught Warphy’s
response. “Talking about Skeleton? Suppose
you are,” he said. “ Everybody seems to be doing
the same, and I do think there is some reason for
interest being taken. If his owner meets with
proper encouragement, it’ll not be the last of
many such importations, I’ll warrant.”
“ Seen him yet, Jenkins ?” queried Warphy,
eager to get an opinion first-hand of the horse’s
points from so competent a judge as Mr. Jenkins.
“ Yes : just left the stables, walked up with Mr,
Richard Jones and young Bob Campbell. Mr.
Jones, by the way, is very glad Skeleton is not a
partnership property, but I don’t think his judg-
ment on the point is as trustworthy as it would be
with regard to a cargo of sugar or Irish manufac-
tures. He is the only man whom I have heard
express regret that Mr. Riley has laid out his
money on the horse. ”
“What’s your personal opinion of the nag,
Jenkins?”
“Simply this, that I saw few such animals at
home, and certainly none out here, that combined
in the same degree the best qualities of a race-
horse and a stallion. He has got shape, substance
and bone. Short legs from the knees, and good
and large to the fetlock. He is a beautiful horse,
and as powerful as beautiful. He and his stock
will prove a mint of money to the country. Then
look at his performances ”
“That’s what I would like to know something
about,” said Warphy.
“ Well, Hall, of the Monitor,’’replied Jenkins,
“ hang the fellow’s impudence ! sent round to me
for the loan of some Calendars, as he wished, so
his message ran, to prepare a list of Skeleton’s
doings. Of course 1 wasn’t going to take the
trouble to analyse the books for him, and I was
equally disinclined to lend them to him, so I re-
turned answer that if he would compile the list
from other sources, I’d compare it with the
Calenders. I’ve heard nothing of the matter
since.”
“Still,”said Warphy, “you must know some-
thing about the doings of the horse, Jenkins 1
Surely you can give us some information.”
“Well, I’ve suggested to Riley he should issue
a card to owners of stock with full particulars, and
he has promised to do so, and it is probable till
that is printed, I shall have to depend for precise
knowledge of the animal’s career on my general
recollections of what I have read in the home
sporting papers, and—well, to tell you the truth,
1 have jotted a few points down just for my own
satisfaction.” With this Mr. Jenkins took out his
pocket-book and favoured his friends (the group
had been increased by the addition of two or three
other interested gentlemen) with certain particu-
lars of the animal’s turf-career.
“ He was bred;-” he began, “ by the well-known
Mr. Kelly in 1820 out of the famous Walter
Raleigh mare, by Master Robert, whose sire
Buffer was in demand for every stable in the king-
dom. Ho first ran on the Curragh of Kildare
under the name of Chanter, he was then not quite
two years old, and came in second and third to
horses he afterwards beat.
“ In 1823, he was bought by the Marquess of
Sligo, who altered his name to Skeleton ; and in
October of that year he won the Kirwan Stakes of
50 guineas each, beating Mr. Caldwell’s filly,
Mary Anno, three years old —his former success-
ful antagonist; Lord Sligo’s filly, Penitence, four
years old; and Mr. Battensby’s horse, Johnny
Raw.
“ In April, 1824, he won the Wellington Stakes,
of 30 guineas each, on the Curragh, beating Mr,
Kirwan’s bay colt, Prince Hohenlohe ; Mr. Hun-
ter’s chestnut, Rolla; and Mr. Irvin’s chestnut
horse, Petworth. On the following Saturday, the
24th, he also took the King’s Plate, of 100 guineas,
beating Mr. Watt’s colt, Munster; Mr. Dixon’s
colt, Giles; and Mr. Battensby’s Irishman.
“ In 1825, he won, in June, the Sweepstakes on
the Curragh, beating Mr. Caldwell’s horse, Noble;
Major Kirwan’s filly, out of Lissey ; Mr. Doolan’s
gelding, Paddy from Cork; and Capt. Hackett’s
Kate.
“In April, 26, he won his chief victory, beating
the celebrated Miss Foote for the Wellington
Stakes, other horses being Blake’s Byron, the
chestnut colt, Soldier, the colt O’Hara, also owned
by Lord Sligo, and Studdart’s chestnut filly, Fanny.
Now, I don’t think much of the mere winning a
race unless you defeat a powerful opponent, but
when he put down as he did in this race, Miss Foote,
he put down what, according to the best opinion,
was the swiftest thorough-bred in all Ireland. It
was in April, I see, that he won the Wellington of
50 guineas each, beating Mr. Hunter’s Hypocrite,
Mr. Kelly’s Drone, his brother; and Mr. Watt’s
Mount Loftus ; and on the following Wednesday
he ran for the challenge of the Kirwan of 50
guineas each, carrying as the winner of the
Kirwan Stakes, 61b. extra. He came in second
then —the last race he ran. Last year he was only
entered for one or two English races, but Sligo
having no confidence in his trainer, sold him
before competing to Prince Esterhazy, from whom
Riley purchased him.”
“ A very notable performer,” said Flicker, “no
doubt, but ” —Flicker always was a sceptical
wretch—“that makes it the more singular that so
remarkable an animal should have been allowed
to go out of the United Kingdom. I can hardly
believe it is the genuine Skeleton— it is not the first
time by a dozen, so I’ve heard, that horses have
been sold for foreign parts with pedigrees that
were first-class and performances that were bril-
liant, the solitary defect in their history being
that pedigree and performances were alike fic-
titious !”
Flicker’s remark excited a little laughter, but
more dissent. But, without meaning it, he had
thrown a damper on the enthusiasm with which
Skeleton had been welcomed to New South Wales.
The seed-grain of doubt grew into a mighty tree,
and there came a time when, three or four years
later, it overshadowed every one of Skeleton’s
progeny. Once people’s minds had been directed
into that channel it did seem strange that a horse
of his quality should have been permitted to
leave England.
» • •
As generally happens, the persons most
interested in the settlement of a doubt or a verifi-
cation of a matter which is in dispute were the
last to hear of it. Mr. Riley and his manager,
Mr. W. H. Dutton, of Raby Estate, were, till the
infection of disbelief had spread widely, in ignor-
ance of the circumstance that anybody had flip-
pantly or. seriously chosen to cast a doubt as to
the authenticity of the stallion so carefully housed
at Raby. Had they heard, they would, it is to be
presumed, scarcely have then withheld from the
public of the colony this letter :
Mansfield-street, London, 16th July, 1828.
Sir,—l regret that I have not the whole pedigree of
Skeleton at present within my reach, but I will state all I
do recollect; He was the best horse of his year in Ireland,
when Lord Sligo purchased him, and by the calendars you
will see his many successful performances.
Lord Sligo had a horse called Arrogance, of the same
year of Skeleton, who won the King’s Plate at Doncaster
when four years old, and ran over the course in as short a
time as ever it was done before or since; I can assure you
that, from public and private running, I am satisfied that
Skeleton was much faster, and in every way superior to
Arrogance.
His own Brother, Drone, now five years old, is the
fastest in Ireland ; he won the Kirwans twice, and isa very
fine animal. Their sire, Master Robert, was decidedly the
best of his year, having beat Friday who was sent to Eng-
land ; and was there considered so good a horse.
If my opinion is of any advantage to have, I feel confi-
dent in the favourable view in which I look on Skeleton.
Master Robert was got by Buffer, his dam Spinster, by
Shuttle, great dam by Sir Peter, great gt. dam by Bour-
deaux. gt. gt. grand dam Speranza, own sister to Saltrem,
by Eclipse. Buffer was got by Prize Fighter, dam by
Florizel. Skeleton’s dam was got by the celebrated Sir
Walter out of the famed Miss Tooley', &c., for which see
Stud-book. Mi-. Kelly, who bred Skeleton, has the finest
filly in Ireland, own sister to him, who is considered the
best of her year, and has won twice that she started. In
short, I think you very fortunate in having got Skeleton,
his blood is excellent, his performances very superior, and
his shapes speak for themselves.
(Signed), Rohbrt Browne.
To A. Riley, Esq.
Mr. Robert Browne was Captain-ranger of the
Curragh, and a cousin to Lord Sligo, and his testi-
monial to Mr. Riley’s veracity would, if published,
have settled the doubts that had arisen. Unfor-
tunately, the owner of the stallion and his
manager were ignorant of any discredit being
thrust upon Skeleton’s hona-fides.
* # *
Skeleton’s groom was an Irishman named
Bennet—Henry Bennet. He had arrived in the
Countess of Harcourt, Bunn, master, in 1822,
under sentence of life for an offence “ not stated,”
having been found guilty in Dublin City on the
ninth day of January of that year. In height he
was five feet five-and-a-quarter inches, and in
complexion he was fresh and freckled. His hair
was brown, and his eyes hazel; and under the
sub-heading of “general remarks ” his parchment
record stated: “Cast in left eye.” A mason’s
labourer by trade, by that ingenious arrangement
of the System which, in.the majority of cases, put
the square man into a round hole, he was
assigned by the Board to Mr. Riley, of Raby, as a
farm hand, and proved himself a decidedly useful
groom.
It was in '2B that Skeleton was put in his
charge, with many promises of floggings if he
failed in his duty, and with no promise at all of
reward if he more than performed it. Now,
being not altogether brutish, Bennet conceived
for the animal that fine affection which so often
grows up between a horse and his master or
attendant. There was more than a spark of vice
ih the stallion. He was controllable only by two
or three of all who had ever handled him, and he
had killed his man “at home.” Harry Bennet,
after a tussle in his loose-box, mastered him, and
Skeleton thereafter never failed to notice his
presence and permitted the groom to treat him as
though he were but a lady’s palfrey caressed by his
mistress’ hand. The care of the animal gave to
Bennet that living subject of interest for want of
which so many convict natures grew nearly, akin
to the brute. He took a pride in his charge’s
strength, and worried over his occasional ailments
as mothers trouble over their dearest child. Once,
if not twice, during every night he passed from the
loft where he slept to the loose-box to see if
Skeleton was all right. He learnt by rote the
horse’s pedigree, and knew every available detail
of the events in which he had been concerned. It
was his one regret that Skeleton was not to be
raced in the colony and that he could not have the
gratification of preparing him for a victory. On
every possible occasion to Mr. William Riley
(“Angora Goat Riley”), Mr, Dutton, and to
every visitor to the estates, he would converse as
long as they would let him on Skeleton’s temper
and capabilities, and “as fit as a fiddle, as hard as
nails, as sound as a bell, as handsome as a pic-
ture,” and the kindred phrases wtih which the
lover of the horse is accustomed to express his
panegyrics were constantly on his tongue.
Through his belief in Skeleton’s merits, he
became rather a bore indeed, did Bennet, to
everyone of his convict associates. His brain had
taken a twist. The consideration that he was
thereby saved from twists of a more pernicious
kind did not, of course, occur to the men when
they got sick of being dosed with Skeleton as an
ingredient in the morning hominy, in the noon-
day soup, and in the evening damper.
Bennet had been sent into Camden one day
with a message relating to one of the ladies of
Skeleton’s harem, and in the bar of the Camden
Inn (still extant, but then a newly-established
element of civilisation) he was discoursing as
usual on Skeleton when one of James Macarthur’s
men told him that he wished Skeleton was dead.
“ ’Tain’t notbink but Skel’ton, Skel’ton, Skel’ton,
all day long, w’en we sees yer, Bennet. We’re
sick of Skel’ton—he’s only an ’oss, all said an’
done. Wish ’e were dead ! I’ve a good mind to
salt ’im down an’ eat ’im !”
“ There’s some bosses which is better’n some
men !” quoth Bennet, in indignant reply. “Skele-
ton ’e’s worth a hundred times a lag like you !”
“ Lag yerself, an’ if I were Mr. Dutton, I ’udn’t
trust you with an ’qss. Yer’d steal the skin of
’im—an’, ’sides, it ain’t Skel’ton at all: the true
Skel’ton never came ’ere at all, so Mr, Ann’bal
ses. ’Tis an ’oss which is ’ere under false
colours.”
“Wot say?” demanded Bennet; “I’ll tell Mr.
Dutton wot Mr. Annibal ses, but I tell you that
the man which ses that I’d steal an oat from
Skeleton is a liar an’ a peachin’ lag !”
Than the latter term of opprobrium nothing was
more offensive in the convict vocabulary. Many
a transport was proud of having been “sent out,”
but ‘ ‘ a lag ” was a reproach to even a Macquarie
Harbqurite or “Black Norfolker,” and the tender
sensibilities of a representative of either class of
permanent ruffian would resent, with tenfold
bitterness the imputation of being “a lag” that
“ peached ” upon his fellow convicts.
When verbal courtesies of this sort were ex-
changed, there could be, of course, but one sequel
—blows. One of the prettiest fights that one
could desire to see then took place between Riley’s
Bennet and Macarthur’s Barnes then and
there in the barn ; and so spirited was it that con-
stable Higgs—he was afterwards an overseer with
the Blue Mountain Road-gangs—having been
sufficiently entertained by the display of pugilistic
science, acting like an emissary of Imperial jus-
tice, locked both up in the watch-house. Skeleton
was within an ace of kicking the brains out of
Bennet’s locum tenens that night, for he missed the
attentions of his accustomed groom.
Major England, of the Fourth, or King’s Own,
and Mr. Hannibal Hawkins Macarthur were the
presiding magistrates the next court-day. Bonnet
—audacious fellow ! took exception to Mr. Macar-
thur’s presence on the Bench. “Yer ’n interested
party, Sir.”
Mr. Macarthur laughed interrogatively. “ How
so, prisoner?”
“Yer said as Skeleton wor not Skeleton, sir,
an’ that’s wot caused the row. ”
“The charge is creating a disturbance in a
public place, and that you, being pris’ners of the
Grown, were drunk on licensed premises ! ” said
Major England,
“ The row took place over Skeleton, an’ nuthin’
else ! ” doggedly repeated Bennet. “ An’ Barnes
there said as ’ow ’e would like to salt Skeleton
down an’ eat ’im, an’ yer an interested party.
Mr. Macarthur, sir, an’ for he said as ’ow yer said
as Skeleton worn’t Skeleton at all.”
Major England’s head moved towards Mr.
Hannibal Macarthur’s, and Major England’s lips,
a second later, inflicted the punishment. “ Forty
lashes for the record, and 25 for insolence to pre-
siding magistrates, Pris’ner Bennet. Prisoner
Barnes is discharged with a caution that unless he
keeps out of disreputable company he will be
severely dealt with. Next! ”
It seems to be the rule of nature that affection
for a loved object shall bring suffering in its train.
Bennet’s experience was not exceptional. His
fondness for the stallion had won him 65 lashes,
and the chance of getting 25 more from Mr.
Dutton on his return, for being absent without
leave for 24 hours.
* # #
That chance, however, to do Mr. Dutton
justice, was not taken advantage of, for he did not
flog Bennet. He was about to do so when Bennet
told him what he had heard, and Dutton, always
of a litigious disposition—as tenant of a farm, he
once carried on a suit-at-law against himself as
trustee of the farm property—resolved to find
out the reason for Mr. 'Hannibal Macarthur’s
statement that Skeleton was not Skeleton. A
convict’s evidence on oath was, by the majority
of landed proprietors, constantly dismissed as
valueless, yet in every relation of life, and in
every department of business, squatting and com-
mercial magnates were guided by unsworn convict
testimony. As a magistrate, Dutton would have
rejected Barnes’ evidence if it were tendered in a
case before him, but he was none the less prepared
to act upon the mere report of another convict of
what Barnes had said. He sought an early oppor-
tunity of visiting Mr. Hannibal Macarthur at
Brovvnlow Farm, where he was then residing.
“Look here, Mr. Hannibal”—it was “Mr.
Hannibal” and “Mr. James” nearly always;
‘ ‘ Mr. Macarthur ” was generally reserved —the
Hon. John was living at Hambleton Cottage, but
the law had pronounced him mad—for references
to Captain John. “ What’s this your man Barnes
says—”
“I have no man Barnes,” retorted Mr. Mac-
arthur.
“ Well, Mr. James’ man, Barnes. What is this
that he says about Skeleton ?”
“You forget yourself, Dutton, in asking me
what any Gbv’ment man says. Gov’ment men
say anything!”
“ But Barnes says that you declared that
Skeleton is riot what he professes to be.”
“ Once more I decline to be held responsible for
what a Gov’ment man says !”
“But did you or did you not say anything to
justify anyone thinking that you do not believe
that Skeleton is the horse we represent him to
be?”
“ Well, if I did,” rejoined Mr. Hannibal, “it is
only what everybody else is saying.”
“ What ! ”
“Haven’t you heard?” said Mr. Macarthur.
“Why, you don’t mean to say that you don’t
know that people have talked openly for the past
couple of years over the horse ? If I’ve heard a
doubt expressed once, I’ve heard it a hundred
times. People laugh when they see your advertise-
ment. Why is it that Bayly’s Whisker, and
Theorem, even Bennetong, are being patronised
by owners this year and last, when formerly
they only received Skeleton’s leavings ? ”
“ I can't say ! It never occurred to me to ask!”
“ Well, it’s because people doubt whether Skele-
ton is Skeleton ! You must have heard, surely ! ”
“xMo,” said Dutton, staggered. “I haven’t
heard, and I’m sure neither Mr. Riley nor Mr.
Will has. And I don’t think it is a friendly
thing of you, Macarthur, to have heard this state-
ment repeated and not to have put a stop to it! ”
“ Why, how could I interfere? I have nothing
to do with the horse, and I’m certainly not going
to take upon myself to vouch for anybody else’s
bona fides. Mr. Riley himself might have been
deceived. I don’t say that he or Will are purposely
deceiving others, and I don’t say that Skeleton
is not the horse that you say he is ! ”
Dutton turned away muttering that perhaps it
was as well for Hannibal’s own sake that he
did not, or otherwise he would make it hot for
him.
* * »
On his return to Raby, as he was putting
his horse into the stable, Mr. Dutton interrogated
Bennet,
“Bennet, is this the first time that you’ve
heard this report ?”
“ The werry fust, sir ! ’Never ’ad no idea there
was enythin’ ever said agen the an’mal. An’ ”
bursting into spluttering rage—“nobody as ’ud
speak the truth ’ud say he ain’t Skeleton ! Look
at them legs, an’ them shoulders ! An’as a stock-
getter, ain’t he wuth ev’ry guinea paid on ’is
’count? No —he’s Skeleton, sure enough. I’d
stake my life on it!”
“ Well, it’s very annoying. I’ll have to see
Mr. Will, and take steps to publish the documents
which prove the horse’s career. And, look here,
Bennet, as you got into that mess and that
flogging for the horse’s sake, come up to the stores
and get a fig of tobacco. I think you deserve it!”
In all ages and climes there have been alchemists
who have discovered panaceas, but it was reserved
for assigned masters in the convict times of Aus-
tralia to ascertain the cure-all properties of “ colo-
nially-grown ” at 2s. per pound—and twelve figs
to the pound. It could even unjustly-
lacerated 1 acks.
* * •
Nothing was more common (save floggings)
than a fight between two convicts ; and the con-
test, with its Court sequel, would not have been
thought of sufficient importance for a single line of
type in the papers had it not been for its connec-
tion with Skeleton. Skeleton’s first stock were
now rising three years, and as two-year-olds
several victories had been secured by his progeny
at the Windsor, the Campbelltown and Sydney
meetings. Nevertheless, and in spite of this
evidence of the quality of the stallion, the court-
case being mentioned by them, the Australian
and the Monitor—the Gazette had no allusion
to the circumstance—refanned the doubts to a
blaze, which was not lessened by a long advertise-
ment inserted by Mr. W. E. Riley in the first-
mentioned paper. ‘‘ Is Skeleton Skeleton ? ” was
one of the burning questions of the day,
and the discussion, for and against, exceeded
in yirulency even that excited by another great
topic of the time—Secretary Macleay’s right to 54
acres of land at Elizabeth Bay.
“ Tell yer wot, Bennet 1” cried Barnes, a month
after the fight, as the two met again, where the
Great Southern Road crosses the Nepean at the
approach to the township, “yer’ll get no more
mares next year. Yer’ll ’av that Skel’ton
sarved out to yer for rashings yet! Save uz
some o’ ’im, will yer ? ” Bennet shook his fist at
the speaker, but as he had no desire to get another
65 lashes, he confined himself to that impotent
action.
The words, however, rankled. In the evening,
in the men’s hut, he told the other assigned hands
what Barnes had said. The effect was not what
he anticipated. They had no special interest in
Skeleton to bind them towards a loyal support of
the Rileys’ assertion that their stallion was the
great Irish performer; and the sentiment expressed
by one Kerr, a farm labourer, was applauded.
“ If Skeleton was made into rashings’ meat, we’d
ha’ somethin’ juicy ! We never has enythin’ juicy
—our rashings are simply scrag, ain’t they ? ’

“ ’Ear, ’ear,” cried the majority.
“ An’ for two pins, I’d be one to make ’im into
rashings ! ” continued the orator.
“Not while I’m alive!” impressively declared
Bennet. “ W’ether he’s the true Skeleton, or a
false Skeleton, he’s—he’s — my Skeleton——”
“’Ear ’im, ’ear ’im ! ’is Skeleton ! Bennets
Skeleton will stand this season at Baby Cow-
pastures !’ ” interrupted his tormentors.
“Yes, my Skeleton ! Eny one who touches ’un
’ud ’ave to do so over my body. Take warnin
now! But o’ course ye’re only foolin’. ’Oss
steal in’s deat h ! r ’ .
“Death or no,” exclaimed a sullen, gipsy-look-
ing convict —French. “ If I don’t get no better
rations than this stuff, I’ll do for Skeleton. _I d
sooner iia’ horse-flesh than maggoty beef. Ye d
better look out for your Skeleton now, Bennet,
and if ye don’t want your own skeleton devilled
with his bones, ye’d better not interfere !”
This talk was, Bennet thought, the merest
bravado, and undoubtedly it had originated in
jocularity. But a true word is often spoken in
jest, and light chatter may engender business of
a serious import. The ration-scale at Baby was
the regular Government one as to quantity, but as
to quality there was no official stipulation except
such as l)r. Wardell had intimated in his paper,
“as was implied by the acceptance by the
authorities of tenders which were too cheap by
half.” At the prison and factories and gang-
stations meat was chargeable at 3£d. per lb.;
and this “cat’s-food standard” (as the fighting-
doctor termed it) was naturally higher than that
issued by the average employer to his assigned
man. Baby was an average estate.
Station-cattle or sheep were not killed for the use
of the hands—not when Oowp isture stock brought,
at the Sydney butchers, 4d. or 4Ad. !—and Mr.
Chisholm, the dealer, supplied the establishment
at 6s. for each 12 men’s rations for a week. Taking
the ration at lilb. (the extra half-pound of meat
being granted in lieu of 11b. oaten or maize meal),
the quality of meat furnished in quantities of
12Glbs. for 6s. may be readily inferred. And the
idea of appropriating Skeleton’s carcase as an
assistance to the ration-scale, once implanted in
the minds of the assigned men, crew rapidly.
“I’ll teach old Dutton a lesson, an’ young
master ! They’d find it cheaper in the long run
to give us meat at tuppence a pound, than to
ration us on eight-hundred guinea stallions,” said
Kerr, the fellow' who had been the first to broach
the notion to the Baby hands.
“It’ud mean the nubbling cheat* for all that
wor in it.” .
“Better Jack Ketch than die o’ starvation!
’Sides, the masters would never take it to court
if we went to work properly. They’d ha’ no
evidence !”
* * *
The idea came to a head one Sunday night.
Mr. Riley and Mr. Dutton were both in the city,
and would not return for a day or two, and the
convict-overseer, who also acted as storekeeper,
had, as was usual with him when not watched,
sought to add to his own emoluments by issuing
short rations. There had been discontent in the
men’s huts and the kitchens that would have
been easily enough quenched had the owner or
manager been present, but, in their absence, took
volume and intensity. Ominous whispers went
round. “They’d teach the Rileys a lesson, they
would !”
The hands, some dozen or fourteen, employed in
the vicinity of the house were locked up at eight
nightly. But that night the overseer, knowing he
had offended the men, thought he would, for once,
risk leaving the doors unlocked. He did not
hanker after a thrashing. His decision was fatal
to Skeleton. _ . .
“ It’s long past lock-up time,” said one in the
larger hut. “ Where’s ‘ Bob Turned-up ?’ ” Bob
Turned-up, the overseer, was so called from the
number of times he had been put on his trial and
acquitted. .
“ He’s afeared to come near us to-night !
replied another. “ He’s afeared we’d dollop him.”
“ Then,” said the prime mover in this business,
“ We’ll go for Skeleton to-night?” And he dis-
closed his plan.
• # •
At midnight the hasps retaining the pad-
lock of Skeleton’s loose-box were wrenched from
the wood by the leader of a gang of men whose
faces were masked with pieces of canvas. The
doors were flung open, and the rogues found them-
selves face to face with Bennet. They had gone
noiselessly to work, but the groom had been on
one of his visits to the box from the contiguous
loft, when he had caught the sound of laboured
iureathing and of rending wood, and had at once
guessed the origin of the noise.
“It’s yer, is it?” he said coolly to the startled
'group, as the light of a lantern was thrown upon
his features. “An’ d’yer know it’s a bangin’fer
yer all ? ”
“ Not if yer can’t give evidence agen us ! lap
him, French, tap him ! ” .
French, the gipsy transport, lifted the timber
billet, with which h? had arriled himself, and
felled Bennet to the cobbled floor. He dropped,
groaned for a second, then passed into uncon-
sciousness. The thieves, after all, had fulfilled
his prophecy. They had only secured access to
the stallion over his body.
# # #
. One of the hands who had sometimes helped
Bennet in the care of Skeleton had been told oft
to get the horse but. Their scheme was to lead
the animal to the parting of the ways by the
Four Mile hut, on the banks of the river, and then
to kill him and cut him up on the atrip of
sandy margin. The tracks of the horse, if followed
up, would be lost at the stream-side, and all
signs of the butchering operation could be readily
removed. The opinion would be created that the
stallion had been stolen, and if the carcase were
salted down, it would be the easiest of matters to
supplement their ordinary rations:by this special
delicacy by the connivance of the shepherd at the
out-station. The principal difficulty was the
sißncing of Bennet. As for themselves, they
were all incriminated, and though one or two
might turn King’s Evidence if suspicion fell upon
the gang, yet they would do so under a penalty
more awful to the convict-mind than hanging
itself." Few Crown witnesses lived lottg after
testifying. ' . , , ,
Bennet was not dead* he was simply beaten
into insensibility. When the horse was brought
out, not without difficulty and danger to his
temporary attendant, the problem arose as to what
was to be done with the groom. Should they kill
him ? That would remove danger of detection by
Ins evidence ! And some were for killing him.
Men had been killed before for the sake of a ration
worth 3i’d. Why should they not kill him when
it was the case of a ration worth eight hundred
guineas ? But
“No ! ” declared the leader. “We’ll make the
horse carry him to the Four Mile. Shep’erd Dick
’ll keep ’im close for a fortnight, an’ we’ll dose ’im
■in the time so that ’is wits won’t be worth nothin’
—at least, not as evidence.”
Skeleton, not without inflicting some damage
with his heels on his guards, was laden with
Bennet, and the gang set forth. The stallion
must have known his rider, for no one but Bennet
had ever mounted him during his Raby career,
for he went quietly to the Four Mile and his
doom.
* # *
The overseer roused the hands out at s'oo
on the Monday morning, and though delighted to
find that they had apparently not known they had
not been locked in, was surprised at the general
disinclination to lap, with the customary eager-
mss, the breakfast hominy. Necessarily, lie was
not informed that only a couple of hours before
the assigned-men had banqueted off hastily-
roasted steaks from Skeleton’s flanks. Never had
convict a richer meal, and never one more satis-
factory at the price. To the assigned-man
generally “fed” on ration-* 1 mag,” a luxurious
horse-steak was the daintiest of morsels.
The remembrance of their feast, all hurried
though it had been, remained with the gang
during the day, and sustained them during the
demand made upon their energies by the discovery
“that Skeleton had been stolen by Bennet.” That
was the news which was despatched into Camden
and Campbell town and thence into Sydney. The
overseer could swear he had locked Bennet in
Bennet must have had an accessory outside, per-
haps a principal, for otherwise how could the
fastenings of the horse-box have been wrenched
away ?—and, and the horse was gone! For, in
the scrub by the Nepean, Bennet was kept care-
fully by Shepherd Dick, and dosed daily on
11 colonially-grown at two shillings the pound,”
and could afford no testimony either for himself or
against others. And, night after night, and,
morning after morning, did the gang and Shep-
herd Dick banquet off Skeleton. After the first
three servings the meat was salt. Still, it was
tasty and filling. For Shepherd Dick knew how
to mix a proper brine, and the meat lost none of
its savour through the circumstance that both it
and the salt, and the cask sunk in the Nepean
sand, were all stolen.
# * *
Dutton, tracing the horse’s tracks to the
banks of the Nepean, there lost them. He searched
west; he searched east; he sent Mr. W. E. Riley
to the north, and himself went to the south.
On his return he met Mr. William standing
with a mutual friend at the homestead door. 11 No
news? ’ was the muttered interrogatory and reply
from each as they faced each other.
“I’ve an idea!” whispered the mutual friend
when they reached the inner room. “Give out
that Bennet, misunderstanding instructions, has
removed the horse to Cavan.” Cavan was the
Rileys’ station in the Murrumbidgee areas.
“ That won’t find us the horse !” testily rejoined
Mr. William and Dutton, simultaneously.
“No, but I’ve heard—and you have heard, too
—that there’s a horse the exact spit of Skeleton,
shape and build, at Launceston. He’s to be had
for a hundred-and-fifty currency. I suggest you
buy him, and then give out that Bennet died at
Cavan. Bring the new stallion here ”
11 It won’t do!” declared Mr. Riley emphati-
cally.
“‘Well,” retorted the other, “ you have now the
credit of doing the same thing ! You may as well
do it, as be supposed to do it !”
* * *
We cannot say whether the Rileys acted
on their friend’s hint. But we do know that the
season after the date of the banquet, the pro-
prietor of Raby issued a circular distinctly in-
tended to set at rest the doubts as to the true
character of Skeleton’s loose-box. And we know,
also, that when an idiotic wretch, who strongly
resembled Bennet in facial aspect, was found
wandering in the bush near Camden, the Rileys
locked him up in the homestead for a time, and
then perceiving him to be quite witless, returned
him to the Assignment Board. As a robber of
men’s brains, “colonially-grown ” in combination
with overproof rum, could be backed against every
other invention of the devil. _ About the only in-
telligible utterance of the imbecile was “S-s-s!
Get over, Skeleton, get over ! ”
* * *.
Three years ago, the host at a small
friendly dinner-party in the Bathurst district,
pressed another slice of the sirloin upon the writer.
“Take another cut 1 ’Tis Blaokdown beef —you
have not often tasted a Juicier morsel! ”
There was an emphasis on the pronoun that in-
duced us to reply ; “Why, have you?”
“ Lord, yes ! When I banqueted off Skeleton !
Did I never tell you that story ? ”
PRICE WARUNG.

THE STRONGEST ARGUMENTS.
A recent issue of the Wolverhampton Chron-
icle contains the following : “ We have for a long
time heard various reports of the wonderful effects
produced by the use of St. Jacobs oil in chronic
cases which have been given up as incurable, but
had always supposed these were enlarged upon
for advertising purposes, like all other patent ot
proprietary medicines, but the reports from all
our leading chemists must be considered one of
the strongest arguments which Can be advanced
respecting the value of any leading article of trade
in their line. Th'e uniformity of these reports
will be noted at once. All speak in the highest
terms of the value of St. .Jacobs oil as an outward
application for pain, 'idle oil is only advertised
to cure rheumatism, neuralgia, gout, sciatica, and
those bodily pains where an outward application
is used. The proprietors of this popular remedy
never advertise the oil to cure those diseases
which it will not actually cure. By so doing lliey
have gained the confidence of the people. We see
by the Liverpool papers that St. Jacobs oil is used
largely on board of nearly every steamship that
sails from that port. Many companies, including
the Cunard, White Star, and some of the South
American lines, do not e ven Consider their ships
ready for sea unless a sufficient supply of this
popular remedy is on board to last the voyage.
Latterly we are informed that all lI.M. troopships
leaving Portsmouth take a large supply of the oil
on board. The oil in yellow wrappers for veteri-
nary purposes is being used with equal y good
results by the leading minibus and cab companies
of London and provincial cities for use on horses
for sprains, sore shoulders, and general ailments
Where an embrocation is required.
“ A leading article in a recent issue of the
Chemist and Drcggist stated that St. Jacobs
oil had the largest sale of any medicine in the
world ; and when an article possesses the actual
merit which St. Jacobs oil undoubtedly does
possess, the proprietors are entitled to receive the
benefit of the enormous sale which this popular
remedy has.”
AN EXPERT’S OPINION.
A gentleman writes to the Editor of the Water-
bury as follows : “I called on M. J. E. Tucket,
jun., an expert watchmaker and engraver, who is
now with R. C. Richmond, of Grlendive, Montana,
whom I had met before in St. Louis. Knowing
his hatred for the Waterbury Watch, I was
surprised to see one of your sighs, Waterbury
Watches ’ hung in the window. Inquiry as to
this brought this in response : ‘ ¥es, I have been
down on the Waterbury watch all my life, and i
have never sold one half dozen of them until t.U.ing
the last month. My reasons for this change are
that I consider both the series ‘ J ’ and ‘ Ladies
Waterbury 5 to be reliable watches. I have tested
them carefully, honestly, and with all the exact-
ness that I, as a practical Watchmaker, could, and
I believe I do my customers Justice by selling
them the Waterbury watches. I believe the
company to-day to be trustworthy friends of the
legitimate watchmaker ; and I feel it to be doing
them a right, my customers a just act, and my
country a blessing, by discountenancing Swiss
watches, and instead selling the Waterbury.”
“I have in constant use on the railroad heri
nine Series ‘J’ besides thirty-two Rockford,
Elgin, and Waltham watches. Last month the
nine Waterburys made an average of 13b seconds,
not one being over 34 seconds off. The other
watches averaged 43 to 12 seconds. The Water-
burys were at a cost of sdol each, the other
watches from 25d0l to 125d01. We carry all kinds
of watches, but ‘ honesty is the best policy
always. I like the Waterburys ; they have been
weighed and not found wanting. I have decided
to recommend them, and to sell all of them i
can.”

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
There is no one who could write this
sketch but ourselves. There is no one but our-
selves who, for years, have arisen at early dawn
watching the coming sun, as yet a golden glow
afar off, and listening to the gentle throbbing of
the great city’s heart. [We can run this kind of
copy off by the yard, and shall be happy to give
lessons in the art. N. B. —No previous knowledge
of literature required.— Ed. B.] Five o’clock
used to be our usual hour for getting up -
“ rising ” is, we believe, the correct term at Potts’
Point, Sydney,—occasionally, however, we have
been about earlier; but that, we think, was when
a sudden influx of the English nobility had
augumented, more than was quite compatible
with comfort, the company in our boiler.
# * *
Oh, but listen ! —Talking of boilers, —once
we, and the son of an English baronet, had a tank
on Gowper’s Wharf (a regular goblin haunt) be-
tween us. He had been recently staying at
Government House; but some venial diffi-
culty having arisen over five silver egg-
spoons and a soup-ladle, he was politely
“biffed out ” by the under-butler (previously
under suspicion), and straightway adjourned
to the Royal Hotel! Here he flourished
in great splendour, for a time; but after a
while appeared to have had a fierce wrestle
with an electro cruet-stand (which he took for
silver) and was defeated with great slaughter. No
proceedings, however, were taken, out of con-
sideration for the social rank his father held in
society (and the Marines); the management even
courteously informing him that he was at liberty
to take away his luggage. As this had, some few
nights before, been lowered down into a friendly
van with the aid of an hotel sheet and a clothes-
line, he raised his hat politely and, shouldering
his tooth-brush, left the premises with a proud
and supercilious air. He came to grief, however,
at his next place of residence. He went to reside
with a widow lady, who had two daughters and a
ouokoo-olook. He made fierce love immediately to
both fair daughters, and eloped with—the cuckoo-
clock. . . But there! Three months ! What
was that ? Not much to him, apparently, for he
came out as good as new, and when he went to
call on an officer at Dawes’ Point to borrow a
little silver, he assured him that he met “some very
pleasant fellahs there.”
« # *
To return to the tank, however. We
would impress upon the mind of the reader that,
sleeping in one is not always half so unpleasant
as the aesthetic mind might imagine. Once inside,
with the lid half on, and a pipe of glowing cigar-
ends in your mouth, there is a delightful feeling of
being out of the world ; of being beyond the reach
of the ladies who ask you the right time when
you have only a schnapper-lead at the end of your
watch-chain; and of the miscreants who arrest
your progress as you are walking along, cursing
the world, and entreat you to come into the
“little oi-l.” To us, indeed, these are quite plea-
sant reminiscences ; though now, of course, we
recline on a chair of buhl, work at a table of
ormolu, write with a pen of marqueterie, and put
on a new pair of yellow kid gloves after each
paragraph. The humours connected with that
tank were of the most delicious character. Times
without number, other decayed noblemen used to
take a fancy to it as a place of residence; upon
whose approach, however, we would imme-
diately put the bung in, and the would-be
tenant, seeing the hole plugged, would then
crawl away discomfited. But, one night, having
grown over-confident, we neglected to close
the aperture, and, in the small hours, we
were awakened by the sound of someone
scrambling up to the top. We (personally) were
considerably alarmed, and suggested uncondi-
tional surrender; but the baronet’s son (he said he
was descended from the Conqueror) was equal to
the occasion. Inserting his head through the hole,
he said, with dignity: “Look heah ! If you
attempt to force your way into these apartments,
I shall —ah—be compelled to give you in charge.”
* * *
Seriously, though, no one could write this
but ourselves. We have taken, like Mr. Silas
Wegg, “a powerful sight of notice” and know
the City of Sydney as well as we do our alphabet,
and a thundering sight better than we do our
multiplication-table. As some funny book says,
when we had got as far as 6 times 9 are 47, we
thought we had gone quite deeply enough, into
mathematics for all useful (and even ornamental)
purposes. We have a taste, you must know, for
the weird and wiclied, and are egregiously “gone”
on the grotesque. While Woolloomooloo makes
us merry, we are depressed by Darling Point and
Macleay-street. Oft at early dawn have we
paused on the pavement in front of Alberto
Terrace, and listened to the snoring of the
Oriental financiers. Golden goblins, some of these
Aaronshes and Sholomons, with eyes of softness
and hearts of stone ! It warms the cockles of our
heart to think, however, that not long ago we
“ bit the ear ” of one of them for a tenner. Dull
figures, these ; but we have a luxuriance of others.
Hold on till we wind them up, and you’ll see
how they’ll go it.
* # #
Cold, muggy and dark, with a damp pave-
ment, and the long, dim vistas of gas-lamps burn-
ing with a surly sluggishness. Dreary, too, you
must know, with an angry grey-black sky, and a
moist, unpleasant wind. We are in Forbes-street
now, and there is not a soul stirring. Stay,
though. A rumble of wheels. Now, mark well
the man in the cart that’s passing. That is the
goblin milkman of Woolloomooloo, We don’t
knovv what country he hails from, but his name is
Patrick MacDermody. We knew him once when
he was a fair and apple-cheeked milkman, who
used to drive in a blue necktie, and serve all
the young ladies’ schools and French laundresses.
In an evil hour he obtained a large connexion
amongst the local hostelries, and then he fell—not
only out of his cart every trip—but morally.
Whenever he serves at an hotel he always has a
drink —sometimes two ; so after attending to the
wants of five customers he is generally “ on his
ear ” at the bottom of the cart, with his face
covered over witli the nose-bag, while his little
nephew drives the rest of the round with his feet
on uncle’s stomach. But come lower down the
stree". Down the lane, nearly opposite the Fish-
market, we knock at a side-door. It is almost
immediately opened by a dapper little fellow in
his shirt-sleeves. This is “ Geordie.” Geordieisa
good-looking little man, but he labours under the
trifling facial disadvantage of only having one eye.
We asked him one day why he did not wear the
other one, and he said that he lost it at the battle
of Salamanca, fighting against the Sardines. We
traverse the bar, and pass through a good old
melodramatic sliding-dqor and enter a small par-
lour furnished with a sofa and a couple of chairs.
There are seven or eight people here, and
they are all goblins !
« » #
Look at the end of the sofa now.

You see that man with a frock-coat all
over mud, and a comically crushed bell-
topper, whose grimy hands, though he holds his
glass with both, are powerless to prevent the
spilling of the precious rum Well that s Henry
Darlon. Who s Henry Darlon. T i •
don tcherknow ? Henry Darlon, you must
learn then, is an English lawyer, who before
coming to Sydney, used to practise with great
success at the various Melbourne courts. He was
noted for his good looks, his talent, .
gentlemanly demeanour. One day he got a letter
sslS sffiti’Tura
Mr. H. D. always had lodgings somewhere, but is
never able to find them, so camps in the Domain
or the watchhouse—whichever comes the most
handy. He’s getting so mixed, now, that we
shan’t be surprised soon to see him give himself
up for drunkenness, defend himself with great
ability at the Central, and sue himself in the
District Court for his fees afterwards. That tall,
thin fellow next him with a barked “ ponum ” and
a glazed eye, whose clothes are vandyked and
arabesqued with the secrets of the culvert, is the
son of aburlyJ.P., and has, or had, a pub. in
New Zealand. He came over, no end of a dandy
after the Melbourne Cup, and for some days
the city was hardly large enough for him.
He stayed at the Domino Club first, tackled
dominoes, and was ingeniously outflanked at the
first onset. Rounding up his forces, he then
attacked icarU on a diet of absinthe and water-
biscuits and was repulsed with severe loss in the
first 48 hours. Beating a hasty retreat to another
hostehae he confronted billiards, but was speedily
cut up by the enemy s cannon. Then he sat
down to think. The loadstone rock was ahead,
He remembered him a friend in Woolloomooloo
Geordie. He sought him out, and at once
commenced to charge the rum with exceeding
fury. Then he became a goblin. Seated on a
chair facing.the door is a hard-faced little man,
with a glass of Old lom in his hand and a fish-
bag on his knee. This is an ex-champion light-
weight pugilist, who is now a bookmaker. He tells
us that he laid something or other to the extentof
s>*ty quid, as . bust him. He has
sought, therefore, consolation in the seductive
fumes of Old Top* and has become a goblin in
consequence. Three other rum-jars in more or
less a condition of dilapidation are jammed
together on the sofa, each one digesting his last
nun, and gloating over the prospect of another.
They have a curious, drawn, wizened look—these
dram-drinking goblins. They are silent, reserved,
and extremely dirty. In their eyes is an unholy
brightness, and if they breathe straight at you,
you die. # # #
Half-past five. Things are livelier now.
Phew ! what a crowd in the shed in which the
fish is sold. Towering above all is Inspector
Seymour, “ one of the most remarkable men of the
country, sir.” He gets up at 3, a human being,
He musters the scavengers at 4, a degenerated
mortal. He enters the Fishmarket at 5 and be-
comes a goblin. What • a sight! Though he
keeps them off with a six-foot wand, the dealer
goblins surround him, shriek at, dispute with
him, but he ip quite immovable. The fish are
knocked down to Nebuchadnezzar, Ginger,
Dutchy, and Goose Egg with stern impartiality.
The goblins are on the whole orderly, though
there is not unfrequently a dispute between
“Goose Egg,” Kate, and “Pair o’Soles”; and

We know our style is attractive. And after all,
it’s a mere trick. Avoid, as far as possible, the
use of semicolons, take plenty of run onwardly,
and there you are! Why, we met a man the
other day who told us that he had only been
practising writing sketches like these for a month

so fast as could be desired, for first the top of his

saw -dust. He has hardly time to pick it up, when
someone invites him to take a drink. Returning
t be cask, he has a long search for matches, and
having at last found one, the head comes off as he
strikes it. This necessitates his proceeding to

over t 0 another goblin to borrow some tobacco,

All is changed. We find that he was one of the
sixteen who was the last to “ kiss the pallid lips of
Walker as he lay lifeless, but beautiful upon the
bloodstained Nicaraguan sward,” and that it was
he who made the historic remark when wo were
threatened with a war with Russia: “We shall

Mr. Frank Isidore Power.
PRESIDENT OF THE GYMPIE TURF CLUB.
In the bustling community of Gympie there is
no face or figure better known than that of Mr.
Frank Isidore Power. Professionally, he ranks as
the most popular solicitor on the G-ympie gold-
fields, socially he takes the cake as principal
leader of the Race Club, as also other sports and
pastimes associated with the district. Mr. F. I.
Power is a native of Brisbane, and brother to Mr.
Virgil Power, the well-known barrister. In addi-

tion to his large practie?, Mr. Frank Power is
considerably interested in the mining and sugar-
growing industries of Queensland. He is one of
the two Australian representatives of the Great
Eastern mine Gympie, now owned by a large
and wealthy English Company. The Great East-
ern G.M. Co. has proved one of the few pheno-
menally rich gold-bearing properties at Gympie.
Mr. Frank Power, in his professional capacity, is
a commissioner of affidavits for Queensland and
New South Wales. Mr. Power scored a popular
win with Wanderer for the Town Plate at the
recent meeting of the Gympie Turf CbT),
It has been observed c.u. worst
feature about the boastful “self-mademan”is that
he looks so dreadfully like the sort of man that a
man like him would be likely to make.
The prospectus of the Sydney Deposit
Bank, whose director is Mr. T. S. Richardson, lies
before us. This institution has introduced a
novelty for public use in the shape of deposit-
notes, which can be purchased by anyone without
giving name or address, while trans‘errable with-
out endorsement, therefore can be paid away or
giv.en as security, while bearing interest at a high
rate during the time of currency. These notes are
issued from £lO upwards for any term at the fol-
lowing rates : 12 months, 7 per cent. ; 6 months, 6
par cent.; 3 months, 5 percent. But special rates
can be procured for longer or shorter periods.
The Bank on fixed deposits allows for 3 years, 9.V
per cent. ; 12 months, 8J per cent. ; 6 months, 7S
percent. ; 3 months, per cent., and during the
last four years a bonus of 1 per cent, has been paid
to all depositors in addition to the current rates on
their deposits. This is the only Bank in Austra-
lasia that thus divides its profits.
Dr. William Mathews, in the North
American Review, lays down the novel theory
that the true index of civilisation is—Suicide.
The more suicides the more civilisation. Just now
c.vilisation is moving onwards, and as a natural
consequence suicide is increasing with tremendous
rapidity. It is increasing, in fact, much faster
than population—so much faster that if the pre-
sent ratios be maintained the people of Europe
and America will one day cease to die natural
deaths, and one-half the population will be kept
busy fishing the remains of the other half out of
tanks and rivers and reservoirs. Germany,
France, and England are the most suicidal coun-
tries on the European continent; Spain, Ireland,
Portugal, Russia, and Turkey the least. The
highest pressure of self-destruction to the square
inch is in Saxony, where education is probably in
the highest state of perfection, and everywhere
the wealthy and cultured classes furnish, in pro-
portion to their number, about six times as many
suicides as the poor and ignorant. In other words, I
the predisposing cause is not want and hunger *
and misery, but weariness, champagne, rich 1
victuals, boredom, laziness, and the absolute iin- I
possibility of raising any new amusement to save '
a used-up rake from utter exhaustion. Know- '
ledge, money, fat, and weariness form the com-
bination which promises to decimate the world.

BUCKINGHAM PARK ESTATE,
MEDLOW (Blue Mountains).
This charming- Estate has its Railway Platform almost
adjoining, and its level land proves it to be eminently
adapted for residential purposes. Nature seems to have
lavished all her varied charms on BUCKINGHAM PARK,
which is, without exception, the CREAM or PICKED
SPOT on the BLUE MOUNTAINS.
BUCKINGHAM PARK ESTATE
Is beautifully surveyed. The Allotments are unusually
large —from 100 up to ISO feet frontages, w-ith long depths
thus enabling buyers to have Garden, Tennis Lawns,
etc., if they so desire. In fact, it may be truly said, there
is no finer Residential Land on the Mountains.
The BELGRAVIA HOTEL, MEDLOW, which cost £4OOO,
is now open for visitors, and is the First Hotel on the
Mountains supplied with the Electric Light, and the
Proprietor is willing to supply any cottages built on the
estate with the electric light. Two elegant Villas are
now nearly finished on this estate. The rapid advance in
the price of land at BLACKIIEATH during the past three
years, amounting to fully 300 per cent., clearly shows that
early buyers at Buckingham Park will make a splendid
investment. Title is TORRENS, and the terms are liberal
and to suit buyers. For particulars, apply to the Pro-
prietor,

Pear Bulletin, —I picked up at a book-
stall the other day a volume of “Selections from
the Poets ’’—American poets, mostly—published
in Boston in 1853. I found in it the following
depressing instance of the irony—one might
almost say the deliberately malignant irony—of
Fate: —
Writing on tub Sands.
I paused at early morn to trace
My name upon the sand,
Nor oared to think how soon the race
Of leaping waters would efface
The record of my hand.
And now—alas, that human pride
So slight a thing may quell !
With yonder works beneath the tide,
I feel that all I’ve wrought beside
May disappear as well.
And dare I deem that all this strife
Of thoughts within my soul,
These hopes with which my heart is rife,
These longings for a glorious life,
Will find a better goal?
The writer of the foregoing laudable lines may or
may not —these things depend upon taste —have
found the “ better goal ” he yearned for in 1853,
but he certainly came close to finding a very good
and substantial goal lately. What is his name?
Well, you would hardly guess that the same hand
which wrote the edifying stanzas quoted above
could have produced the scriptui’y satyriasis (see
dictionary passim) attributed to that most obscene
of “ ghosts,” Wilfred Murray. And, yet, most
likely you would—Satanic cynicism being (I
speak with all respect) a weakness of yours. Yes,
the author of “Writing on the Sands ” was W.
H. Hurlbert —he was innocent then, and hud no
occasion to spell his .name Ilurlbut in order to
throw an aristocratic English glamour over his
quaint and curious vices— whose brilliantly
horrible letters caused such a sensation in a Lon-
don court not long since, and had the effect of
making him vanish abruptly from London society
to enter on a wild-ghost chase for Wilfred Murray.
And now the authorities are on his track for per-
jury ! How ho must have wished, when the letters
were brought forth, that he had always confined
himself to “Writing on the Sands!” Young
men about to enter on the pursuit of poetry should
take warning from the fate of Hurlbut and begin
by being wicked —as Swinburne did. The chances
are that they, if they do so, will end, like Swin-
burne, by producing poetry warranted not to
bring a blush even to the cheek of mock-modesty.

Hero, the Frima Donna.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
VVhafc a fuss there was, to be sure, over
Hero, the prima donna Hero will do as
well as any other name—when that clever
young woman made her first appearance in
Barataria ever so many years ago! Every-
body said she was charming, and no two
people could agree upon the exact reason
why. The critics found fault with her sing-
ing, which indeed was not of a very high
order, but declared that her arch manner and
quaint oddities took them captive. The women
declared that she was a heap of affectation, but a
genius in matters of costume, and the men ran
after her like boys after a circus simply because it
was noised abi’oad that she was unconquerable.
Hero understood them all and played with them
all, and advertised herself by them and through
them to her heart’s content. She got up a boat’s
crew of girls and rowed stroke-oar herself, and did
it very well. She swam and dived in a very be-
witching and perfectly decent costume; she drove
the quaintest little ponies that ever were seen
with a free hand and a dashing style that com-
pelled applause, and, in short, she enjoyed a year
of unbounded popularity, dining which time she
bagged quite a nice little sum of money. Finally,
she sailed for her native land amid a chorus of
good wishes and invitations to return as quickly
as possible.
“Well,” said the popular Bill Bluster, best,
shrewdest, and kindest of operatic managers, but
vociferous withal and given to the use of violent
language, “ she’s all fake, by sheol, and nothing
but fake, but she’s deuced smart and a blanked
sight cleverer than those blooming idiots that
carry their crimson noses so high in the air. She
can just come back when she likes, by Ashtaroth,
and I’ll give her a dashed fine show by blankety
and dashety and destruction, I will.”
But Hero did not come back for half a-d zen
years, and when she did return poor Bill Bluster’s
kindly heart and noisy tongue had been still in
death for many a long day.
But that must have been a small matter to
Hero, who was not given to vex herself about
other people’s troubles. She came back to find
her name still remembered and her welcome still
warm for her. The change was in herself, and it
was a complete and startling transformation. The
Hero who had left was a slim, fragile little
creature with fair hair and big, mild eyes which
she invariably managed to cast down at the
moment when you were trying to make up your
mind as to their colour. The Hero that came
back was a short, stout, podgy woman much too
tightly laced, with bold eyes that all the world
could see were green as to their pupils and blood-
shot as to their whites, with hair the colour of tow
and a brazen, aggressive manner that extorted
compliment while it destroyed admiration. Worse
than all, the unapproachable Hero, who had
never been seen without her duenna at her first
visit, now travelled in company with a very
caddish low-comedian who was introduced as the
stage-manager of her troupe.
But her altered personality after all only affected
the few persons who were compelled to come into
immediate contact with her. The great question
as to what the public would say was in no way
affected by any diminution of the charm «he had
once exercised over her associates. The managers
might growlingly allege that the pleasant little
woman had turned into a greedy little shrew, but
they were quite prepared to put up with that if
she would draw full houses. This, however, after
the first curiosity of the playgoing crowd was
a?suaged, she proved unable to do. She required
more consideration than ever from all around her,
and gave less in return. She quarrelled with
everybody she came near, alienated all her old
friends and made no new ones, and, finally, in
default of any manager who would endure her
exactions, had to assume the direction of her own
affairs and the risk of her own productions.
A year or so of her own management led her to
bankruptcy, and bankruptcy led to various un-
comfortable disclosures. The very low comedian
had died, and had been succeeded by a young
squatter, by a not very young solicitor, by a
white - headed young tailor, and by divers
persons of more or less notoriety, and the
queerest of queer stories began to be circulated
concerning Hero’s domestic arrangements. For
a time it seemed as if she were quite out of the
race, but presently a sharp, speculative agent
tried his hand at her affairs, and succeeded in
steering her through a fairly profitable season.
He appeased her creditors with a composition,
rescued her wardrobe from the assignees, concluded
an engagement for her with a manager abroad,
and, finally, shipped her off to the East in com-
parative comfort.
Hero, however, had not learnt wisdom by
misfortune. She had not subdued any of the
propensities which had brought her to grief, and
her Eastern career only intensified her downfall.
Her fancy settled upon Gamboge, the basso, who
sad been for quite a long time, six months at
least, a faithful husband to a much-enduring wife,
and she did not leave the gentleman in doubt as
to the effect of his fascinations. She sent down
one night to the hotel where he was staying to
say that a native was slinking about near her
bungalow and that she was frightened. The gal-
lant Gamboge, who had already retired to rest,
arose and left his reluctant wife, who lias since
been blessed with but one fleeting glimpse of her
runaway spouse.
Mrs. Gamboge’s plight was a sad one. Her
private fortune, which had been large, had long
been dissipated by her husband’s extravagances,
and no money reached her after his disap-
pearance. When the hotel-keeper dunned her fer
lier bill she applied to Hero, as the nominal
head of the company, for some part of her
husband’s salary. Hero sneered at her. “ I
have no money,” she said, “I have assigned
everything to Eurly, the baritone. Go to him and
he will take you on in the chorus. You have a
good figure, go and show it on the stage and you
will be worth a salary.”
A day or two after, Mrs. Gamboge, bereft of hus-
band and home, stood shelterless in a public street,
her infant in her arms, without a penny, a crust
or a friend. Her trunks were detained for her
hotel-bill. She knew not where to get her next
meal nor where to shelter her child’s head, and as
she leaned crying against a lamp-post a laden car-
riage rolled rapidly by bearing her husband and
Hero who—yes, Hero, smiled and nodded as
she passed ! The lamp-light shone on the tears of
the deserted wife, and a gentleman stopped in
sympathy and astonishment.
“ Are you not Mrs. Gamboge? What are you
doing here? Is anything wrong! Don’t you
know that your husband’s going with the com-
pany to China! You will miss the boat. Can I
help you ?”
tt • •
The poor woman broke down and told her
sad story, and her new friend telegraphed a brief
abstract of the case to a great Baratarian theatrical
firm who had been not a little troubled in their
time by the peculiarities both of Hero and her
companion. The junior member of the firm re-
ceived the telegram, and was as prompt to aid as
though the runaway pair had left the happiest
memories behind them. Ho did not even await
the arrival of his partners before committing him-
self to a heavy responsibility. His return message
ran—“ Supply all Mrs. Gamboge’s necessities,
pay her passage to Barataria, America, or Europe
and charge this firm.” The poor woman decided
to come to Barataria, the firm adopted and
developed the action of their partner and presently
by their liberal aid Mrs. Gamboge was restored
to her friends in the land of the Stars and Stripes
from which she, like her husband and his frail
companion, had origiuallv hailed.
• *' •
Hero was not particularly lucky in the
rest of her Eastern tour, and a third smash re-
sulted from her operations. Those who followed
her movements wondered what she would do next.
She could not return to America, where there was
an injured husband, a deserted family, and an in-
different public to face. She could hardly expect
to get any lucrative engagement in England where
her recent failures would be widely known, and
she decided to return to Barataria, where she
evidently thought she could live down all
enmity and achieve her old renown. It was
a delusive hope. She succeeded in getting
a couple of new operas, but she was
plainly incompetent to bear any responsible
part in either, and after vainly trying her luck as
a comedienne, she relapsed into poverty and
penury. Gamboge, whose voice had lost its
beauty and whose singing was woefully impaired,
found himself at the time excluded from the stage,
and the whole, sad story ended, so far as Bara-
taria is concerned, by the departure of the couple
for Africa, their passages being paid by means of
a charitable subscription among the bookmakers.
It needs no prophet to foretell the fate of Gam-
boge and Hero. They are both in the prime of
life, but their physical powers are exhausted and
their accomplishments impaired. Indolence and
alcohol, vice and conceit, have between them
robbed the guilty pair of all claims to admiration,
and in all probability the tale so far truly told
will have a terrible and tragical termination.
“THE BULLETIN.”
(Published at SYDNEY, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
“The Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal ,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and du
tinctive Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
Payment of Members.
One Person, one Vote.
State Revenue derived directly from the Land.
Complete Secularisation of State Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
The Bulletin denounces—
Religious Interference in Politics.
Foreign Titles.
The Chinese.
Imperial Federation.
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is fouqil
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin fs an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin wai
started eleven years ago with no capital but brains,
p''.a has become a vast property, because it pos-
sesses a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the pi-oduction of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress: it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushraan of the Far Nor h, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-she ler of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the New Zealand
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently reniailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and mqst
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

A WONDERFUL MEDICINE.
Beecliam’s Pills
P-STEttT
PILLS.
Are universally admitted
to be worth a Guinea
a Box for bilious
and nervous disorders,
such as wind and pain in
the stomach, sick head-
ache, giddiness, fulness
and swelling after meals,
dizziness, and drowsiness,
cold chills, flushings of
heat, loss of appetite,
shortness of breath, oos-
tiveness, scurvy, blotches
on the skin, disturbed
sleep, frightful dreams,
and all nervous and trem-
bling sensations, &c. The
first dose will give relief
i n twenty mi mates. Every
sufferer is ea.nestly invited to'try one box of these
.rills, and they will be acknowledged to be
Worth a Guinea a Box.
For females of all ages these Pills are invaluable,
as a few doses of them carry off all humors, and
bring about all that is required. No female should
be without them. There is no medicine to be found
equal to BEECHAM’S PILLS for removing any
obstruction or irregularity of the system. If taken ac-
cording to the directions given with each box they will
soon restore females of all ages to sound and robust
health. This has been proved by thousands who have
tried them, and found the benefits which are ensured by
their use
For a weak stomach, impaired digestion and all disorders
of the liver, they act like “ MAGIC,” and a few doses will
be found to work wonders upon the most important
organs in the human machine. They strengthen the
whole muscular system, restore the long-lost complexion,
bring back the keen edge of appetite, and arouse into ac-
tion with the ROSEBUD of health the whole physical
energy of the human frame. These are “ FACTS” testified
continually by members of all classes of society; and
one of the best guarantees to the nervous and debilitated
is, Beecham’s Pills have the largest sale of any patent
medicine in the world.

Noble-street, Newton, Geelong,
10th December, 1888.
To H. F. Kcuklmann, Esi(.
Dear Sir,—This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. I consulted,
m&re than one doctor, and during that time took a great
quantity of medicine without it doing me the slightest
good, blit I became worse every day, wasting away until
1 became a perfect skeleton. About February last I began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I
was expectoratingevery day, I became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. I agreed
and went under your treatment in "March last. At the
end of three-months I was taken had one morning, and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time I commenced to improve, and
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, 1 am as well as ever.
P. KEENAN.
Declared and subscribed before me, one of Her Majesty’s
Justices of the Peace, for the Southern Bailiwick, in the
County of Grant, this 10th day of December, 1888.
