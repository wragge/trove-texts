Seppelts
the north coast of Scotland
is a group of some ninety
islands which together form a
county, the Orkney Islands. On
the largest of these, Mainland or
Pomona, stands the county’s capital,
Kirkwall, near to which stands the
Cathedral of St. Magnus. Some
parts of this building date from the
twelfth century, others were added
in the sixteenth century, and in the
nineteenth century the building was
substantially restored. Of Norman
design, the cathedral is built of red
sandstone. Known in early times as
the Orcades, the Orkney Islands
were conquered by the Norsemen in
the ninth century and became de-
pendencies of Norway and Den-
mark. In 1468, when Christian I of
Denmark married his daughter to
James 111 of Scotland, he handed
over the islands to Scotland as
security for a dowry which was not
paid and the islands then became
Scottish.

A MATTER OF HYPHENS.
In Deaths and Entrances (Dent),
though not so formidably as in his first
Twenty five Poems, Dylan Thomas still
brandishes the adjective as the principal
weapon for his poetic effects: attempting,
that is to say, to make a virtue of what
is notoriously a weakness of style. The
purest poetry:
Daffodils
That come before the swallow dares, and take
The winds of March with beauty—
has always been that from which adjec-
tives were eliminated ; but Thomas, even
in his best poems, will use two de-
scriptive words where one would suffice:
Secret by the unmourning water
Of the riding Thames —
and in his more extravagant moments
employs a kind of loaded epithet
(“accrued sand,” “vultured urn”) which,
while one is hunting for the meaning,
makes his verse stop dead.
If he shows himself unrepentant in
this respect, it does appear that at least
he has realised that compound, hyphen-
ated adjectives look ugly and, what is
worse, because they force the mind to
wrestle with and reconcile two jarring
ideas (as in “heron-priested”), hinder the
swiftness of movement and immediacy
of impact essential to the lyric. At a first
glance there are very few compound
adjectives in Deaths and Entrances.
But a closer inspection shows that, in-
stead of adopting the proper and obvious
course of dropping the hyphenated adjec-
tives, Thomas has merely dropped the
hyphens. “Heron-priested” is printed
as “heron priested.”
The result of this fantastic typographi-
cal trick is a great deal of unnecessary
obscurity. Until one has learned to
supply the missing hyphen, line after line
is either puzzling or meahingless. For
instance:
Listen and look where she sails the goose
plucked sea
My wishes raced through the house high hay....
From every true or crater carrying c10ud....
The judge blown bedlam of the uncaged sea
bottom
Crying at the man drenched throne
The woman breasted and the heaven headed....
On a bread white hill over the cupped farm....
To glow'after the god stoning night
The death biding two lie 10ne1y....
and, for a final example from the scores
that could be quoted, a line that, meaning
nothing to an Australian mind which
automatically supplies the hyphen, must
mean a good deal less than nothing to an
Enylish reader wondering why ducks bill
or send bills to platypuses:
The duck billed platypus broody in a milk
of birds.
It is obvious from this trick, and from
the omission of other vital marks of punc-
tuation, that Dylan Thomas is deliberately
trying to puzzle the reader. And this,
though it is one of the fashions of the
age, is unmannerly. Poetry is not a game
for pedants or a joke for highbrows but a
communication from the gods. Since
Dylan Thomas is thus wilfully making
gibberish of his art, he cannot reasonably
expect a reader, other than a pedant or
a highbrow, to wrestle with his com-
plexities.
But of course, for the poetry underlying
the foolery, the work is worth considering.
In England it appears to have been
overrated. To W. J. Turner it is poetry
of genius, but it is impossible to admit
that Deaths and Entrances could establish
Thomas as a major writer. It is 10 years
since he published Twenty five Poems, and
the 24 new poems in the present collec-
tion, no long poem among 1 them, are a
meagre output for a decade, even if one
takes into account his two prose works
during the period and the possibility that
this book does not contain his full pro-
duction. Dealing principally, in an auto-
biographical way, with the four themes
of love, war, childhood and childbirth,
the book gives an impression that Thomas
may not have much to say and so —in
the hope of surviving as a curiosity—is
bent on saying it extravagantly.
On the other hand, the work has grown
both clearer and more attractive than that
of Twenty five Poems and might equally
suggest that, in spite of the author’s efforts
to prevent it, a genuine lyrical talent is
trying to force its way through. A stanza
from “Fern Hill,” for example:
All the sun long it was running, it was lovely,
the hay
Fields high as the house, the tunes from the
chimneys, it was air
And playing, lovely and watery
And fire green as grass.
And nightly under the simple stars
As I rode to sleep the owls were bearing the
farm away,
All the moon long I heard, blessed among
stables, the nightjars
Flying with the ricks, and the horses
Flashing into the dark.
Once the obstructive mannerisms are
disregarded there is no poem without its
moments of charm, and some of the
shorter pieces, “The Hunchback in the
Park,” for instance, are completely clear
and effective. ’ Some nostalgic poems of
childhood—“ Fern Hill” and “Poem in
October” —are outstanding for their pleas-
antly pastoral quality. The best poem in
the book, “A Winter’s Tale,” which has
the beautiful concluding line “And she
rose with him flowering in her melted
snow,” is obscure, but with the kind of
obscurity that grips the imagination. A
poem that might be about the poet’s dis-
covery in winter of the phoenix, the Muse,
love, religion, dawn, life or spring, it
contains some strangely compelling writ-
ing:—
In the mantle and calm,
By the spit and the black pot in the log bright
light.
And the sky of birds in the plumed voice
charmed
Him up and he ran like a wind after the
kindling flight
Past the blind, barns and byres of the windless
farm.
In the poles of the year
When black birds died like priests in the cloaked
hedge row
And over the cloth of counties the far hills
rode near,
Under the one leaved trees ran a scarecrow of
snow
And fast through the drifts of the thickets
antlered like deer.
Technically, the verses are always in-
teresting and sometimes captivating.
There are occasional flaws —the rhyming
of “male” with “betrayal,” for example,
or the assonance of “homes” and “bones”
(too much like a bad rhyme)—but there
is generally a skilful use of the devices of
off-rhyme and assonance which, though
dangerous, are worth exploring and have
largely replaced correct rhyme in con-
temporary English versification. Internal
rhyme is also used with some pleasant
effects. The verse-forms, too, are attrac-
tive. Recalling to mind another English
poet with a small output—Thomas Gray
—Dylan Thomas seems to be moving
closer and closer towards the construction
of the type of formal ode that has rarely
been attempted since Swinburne.
And, lastly, in emotional tone, though
in the incomprehensible “Ballad of the
Long-legged Bait” and in the repeated
use of the keyword “wound” there is
some concession to the cruel and bloody
art of the surrealists, the general ten-
dency of the poems is towards joy and
the affirmation of life: a distinct advance
on Twenty five Poems and a notable
achievement in war-time England.
Deaths and Entrances, to sum up, is a
book in which merits and defects are
fairly evenly mingled. Its mannerisms
rob it, as a whole, of the quality of
delight. No poem, as poetry should do,
takes the breath away with beauty. At
his best and at his worst one fs too much
aware that the poet is straining for effect.
It is good work marred by showman-
ship.
For Fishermen Only.
G. D. Luard’s Fishing: Fact or Fan-
tasy (Faber) is a gentle, a frank and a
disarming book. The author does not go
quite so far in confession as Negley
Parson, who admitted in his memorable
Going Fishing that he had caught trout
with frogs for bait, but Mr. Luard has at
least used worms.
And has done very well with them, too ;
in one day on the Little Water near
Ballyhimmock, in Ireland, he and a
friend named Dick took 80 fish, all on
that wicked bait. The river was in flood
and they were fishing the backwaters.
Besides his expert knowledge, Mr. Luard,
like Izaak Walton, has a personal fond-
ness for worms, and discusses them lov-
ingly:—
There are various kinds of worms. Some
swear by the cockspur, slim, succulent and
of a delicate red. But these are hard to
come by except in graveyards where most
people are not over-inclined to search.
Others claim that the ordinary pink-headed
garden worm, if well scoured, is superior
to all, and in floods when the water is
thick I certainly give him first place. The
active dark red worm with flattened tail is
to be avoided... .For clear water, a good
supply of the bitter, odoriferous orange
striped brandling of the dunghill is all that
I desire.
Since Mr. Luard has also descended to
the use of prawns and grasshoppers, his
book, of course, will be shocking to
Australian dry-fly purists. But perhaps
even Australian dry-fly purists, in private
and when desperate, have also done dark
and shocking deeds. What is really
shocking to an Australian reader in
this book, as in all English fishing
reminiscences, is the way Mr. Luard,
in that land of enclosed waters,
has to beg or buy or borrow a
little piece of river to fish in. And
Australian anglers might take his book
from this aspect as a warning, for
there are not wanting a few curmudgeons
of landlords in this country who, some-
times because they want to make money
out of thp Acclimatisation Societies’ trout
and sometimes because they like playing
Squire, will contest an angler’s right to his
fishing. Even Mr. Luard, who usually
accepts his country’s customs without a
murmur, thinks his uncle a little too
punctilious when, having leased a house
on the Don, he is too correct either to
fish the river or to ask permission from
the two old ladies who own the house
and the fishing-rights.
However, Mr. Luard is not concerned
with Australian problems; nor, except in
impassioned intervals, with worms. He
fishes dry-fly and wet-fly, he uses the
minnow for salmon, and in a lake in Italy
he observes (but does not himself em-
ploy) the most monstrous device ever
invented for taking trout: a contraption
of 30 spinners, each with its own hook,
trolled behind a boat to represent a shoal
of minnows.
The book’s title, like most of the writ-
ing, is mildly jocular. Though Mr. Luard
has one chapter of collected tall stories
—the best is of five salmon, trying to leap
a rapid, landing themselves in a fisher-
man’s boat —he does not deal much in
fantasies. He rambles about England,
Scotland and Ireland, recalling fish he has
taken and bigger fish he has lost, and
any angler will find quiet enjoyment in
his company. A man who has taken a
30-pound salmon in the dark on a trout-
rod and who, on his last page, loses a
20-pound (estimated) trout in an Italian
lake is a man worth listening to.
Without the Flourish.
It is a pity that Alexander Woollcott
(Hamish Hamilton) was not written by
Alexander Woollcott. He might have told
as much—or almost as much—of the
awful truth about himself as does Samuel
Hopkins Adams ; but he would have told
it, one hopes, with an air ; with a flourish.
Except as a flourish—as a mask or a pose
—he had no existence, and when the
flourish is taken away from him he lies
crumpled and petty in the public gaze,
like a burst balloon,
Samuel Adams has not—consciously,
at any rate —set out to puncture his late
acquaintance’s reputation; he professes
a qualified friendship and a qualified
admiration. But he has approached his
subject in the spirit of a taxidermist, one
might say ; and, though the operations of
flaying and disembowelling are most faith-
fully performed, and there is some
attempt to reassemble the carcass, the
final effigy is too obviously stuffed with
straw.
The book is possibly unjust. From
Adams’s narrative it is clear that while
cultivating rudeness and buffoonery in
public, Woollcott was charitable in
private; that he entertained and was on
friendly terms with an impressive list of
celebrities at Lake Bomoseen ; that he
was genuinely anxious to take an active
part in the Great War; that he helped
many an unknown man of talent on the
way to success—Fred Astaire, Will
Rogers and Paul Robeson among them;
that he was courageous if erratic as a
dramatic critic. But, for the most part,
the biographer appears to concentrate
on the less amiable aspects of Woollcott’s
character.
These, as set down by Adams, are so
far from attractive that one does not
care to quote extensively. It is perhaps
sufficient to record that, though university
students are not infallible judges of men,
Woollcott enjoyed the nickname of
“Putrid” at his college and, for the good
of his soul, was frequently dipped in the
fountain. His private taste in humor,
contrasting with the grace of his writing,
seems to have been limited to the lavatory.
He sold his pen shamelessly to radio
advertisers. His cultivation of rudeness —
an affectation which probably began with
Whistler and is at best an elementary
form of advertisement —was carried to
extremes when, asked by an old lady in
a bookshop to autograph one of his
aooks, he coarsely inscribed it “To an
aid bore.” And his pursuit of notoriety
—publicly falling on his knees in homage
o Somerset Maugham—might be re-
garded more as an insult than as a corn-
aliment to literature. An anecdote may
je quoted as typical:
If there was any limelight glowing, it
was intolerable to Aleck not to share it.
He was at supper one night at the Savoy
Grill, one of London’s smart after-theatre
spots, with two fellow alumni of Hamilton,
Wallace Johnson and John V. A. Weaver,
and the wife of the latter, Peggy Wood,
then starring in a seasonal success. A few
tables away sat Edna Ferber with some
friends. The room was filling up with
prominent people, several of whom came
over to greet the star of the theatrical
moment. Others were gathered about the
adjacent authoress. Nobody was paying
any heed to Alexander Woollcott.
This went on until the victim of public
neglect could stand it no longer. Catching
up a large serviette, he flung it across his
shoulder in the style of a matador’s cape.
With his other hand he appropriated a
carving knife. Thus equipped, he burst
into the circle surrounding the other table,
capered before the distressed Miss Ferber,
and vociferated, “You shall not enter
Mexico, Senorita.”
Few besides the Americans present knew
that some of her writings had offended the
Mexican Government and there had been
talk of barring her from that country. To
the tolerant British, observing in well-bred
surprise, it would be just another instance
of the, unaccountable American humor.
Nevertheless, Aleck had made his effect,
such as it was. He ambled back to his
own place, content and smiling, which is
more than could be said of his compatriots
thus helplessly involved in the fustian
drama.
A measure of injustice may be done to
Woollcott not only by the profusion of
such anecdotes showing him, as Adams
says, “cheap and shoddy,” but by the
biographer’s failure to reproduce the
sparkle that, in life, may partly have
atoned for his antics. The grosser bodily
functions are, after all, a very respectable
subject of music-hall humor and have
been celebrated in classic literature. The
difference between smut and Rabelaisian
laughter is in the tone of voice, reflecting
a mind morbid or healthy. The difference
between offensive rudeness and amiable
clowning may be a question of manner as
well as of manners. Adams’s cold taxi-
dermy may not have been the most suit-
able method for reproducing the figure of
Woollcott as his friends knew him.
But if the picture is presented in an
unfavorable light, Adams certainly
adduces enough evidence to prove that
the injustice is far from total. He will
arouse in most readers such an acute dis-
like of Woollcott that, even if it is modi-
fied by sympathy for a pathological mis-
fortune, they can hardly fail to concur
with Robert Benchley, who told the sub-
ject of this book —and meant it, says
Adams —to “go away and stay away.”
As if aware that the question would
arise whether such a subject was worth
a book, Adams sub-titles his biography
“The story of an American phenomenon”
—indicating, presumably, that it may be
read as a social document. This provides
an acceptable method of approach, and,
in fact, by far the most attractive pas-
sages are those not directly concerned
with Woollcott but with the life of New
York around him —the wits, the news-
papermen, the theatre people, the fight
for freedom of criticism. But since there
is hardly a continual and comprehensive
view of the social conditions that made
the rise of Woollcott possible, the “docu-
mentary” notion would seem to be an
afterthought.
The defence, in any case, was not neces-
sary. Irrespective of liking or dislike for
the subject, this is the fife-story of a man,
and all men are interesting. Adams's
typically American frankness is wholly
to be approved, and the only criticisms
that may properly be made of him as a
biographer are that, as has been said, he
may be a little unjust, that he has not
quite clarified his outlook on Woollcott,
that he has to some extent mistaken a
contemporary goose for a permanent
swan, and that his book is overwritten.
As a study in vulgarity Woollcott was
worth doing, but not at this length: the
“cheap and shoddy” anecdotes become
tedious.

When you save there’s a double satisfaction

at the same time you put the boot into black-marketeers —good and hard!
This is how it works. Black-markets flourish only when there is more money
about than there are goods on which to spend it, and when people compete for
these scarce goods. Then “Mr. Smart” will sell to the highest bidder, regardless
of value, regulations or other protective measures. Price Control and Rationing
combat black-markets and inflationary tendencies, but they need your co-operation,
through saving, to be fully effective.
All you need do is to buy only essential goods
at fixed legal prices, always surrender coupons, and
avoid black-markets.
There’s a big kick in saving—a secure future for
you, and a painful one for the black-marketeer.

What was the Rye House plot?
A conspiracy in 1683 among some
of the more violent followers of the
first Earl of Shaftesbury to seize
Charles II and his brother on their
return from Newmarket at the Rye
House in Hertfordshire. The plot
failed, but its discovery brought to
light a combination of Parliamentary
Whigs, who, while perhaps intending
no personal violence against the king,
contemplated compelling him to
summon a Parliament. Lord William
Russell and Algernon Sidney were
implicated in this and executed.

How to propagate daphne shrubs
by layering?
For layering, bend a limb of
seasoned wood, cut it halfway through
and slit the stem for about an inch
along with a sharp knife. Lay the
treated limb in a trench or depression
of the soil in which there is a big
helping of sand, then fasten it down
securely with wire or a forked stick.
It will have to be left undisturbed
for at least six months, then if the
foliage is still green sever it from
the plant. If the limb is too far from
the soil use a box of soil placed on
a stand.

Origin of the American song “The
Star-Spangled Banner” ?
It is said to have its origin partly
in the air of “To Anacreon in
Heaven,” a convivial song of the
Anacreontic Society of London, pub-
lished in 1771. To this tune Francis
Scott Key, an American, set the words
of a patriotic hymn on the occasion
of the British attack on Fort Mc-
Henry in 1814. The words and air,
which at first had no great popularity,
became an American national song
at the time of the Civil War and
were later made officially the national
anthem of the United States.

I am a local-government employee,
and when addressing correspondence
to aldermen always use the form
“Mr. Alderman J. Smith.” Is this
correct ?
Titles and Forms of Address (Black
and Cos., London) indicates that an-
alderman is addressed during office
as “Mr. Alderman,” an official letter
commencing with “Dear Sir,” a social
letter with “Dear Mr. Alderman” or
“Dear Mr. Alderman Jones,” and the
envelope being addressed “Mr. Aider-
man J. Jones.” However, while this
practice may be customary in Eng-
land, we are not aware of its use in
Australia, and it is suggested that you
use the customary form of address for
official correspondence to aldermen,
which is “Dear Sir,” a social letter
commencing “Dear Alderman Jones”
and the envelope being addressed
“Alderman J. Jones.”

Some details concerning the author
Bret Harte?
Francis Bret Harte was born at
Albany, New York, in 1836; was
taken to California when 15, where
he probably saw something of mining
life. But he was of studious and
literary tastes and worked on various
newspapers and periodicals in San
Francisco, to which he contributed
the short stories which made him
famous. Notable among these were
“The Luck of Roaring Camp” (1868)
and “Tennessee’s Partner” and “The
Outcasts of Poker Flat” (included in
the 1870 collection). His humorous-
pathetic verse includes: “Jim,” “Her
Letter” and “Plain Language from
Truthful James.” Bret Harte was
American consul at Crefeld in Ger-
many (1878-80) and at Glasgow
(1880-85), after which he lived in
England. He died in 1902.

Some particulars regarding the poet
who wrote “The Hound of Heaven” ?
He was Francis Thompson, bom
in 1859 at Preston, England, and
educated at Ushaw College, Durham,
and Owens College, Manchester,
where he studied medicine. Failing
to obtain a degree he came to Lon-
don and lived in ill-health and poverty
until Wilfrid and Alice Meynell, to
whom he had submitted some poems,
recognising in him a poet of unusual
quality, came to his aid. His first
volume of poems, which included
“The Hound of Heaven,” was pub-
lished in 1893, others in 1895 and
1897, and a complete edition of his
works, including prose, edited by
Wilfrid Meynell, in 1913, He died
of consumption in 1907.

Who was Edward Whymper?
Whymper, born 1840, died 1911,
was a pioneer of Alpine climbing
who made the first ascent of a num-
ber of peaks in the Alps. His first
successful ascent of the Matterhorn
in July, 1865, was followed by a
disastrous descent, three of his party
being killed. He related his experi-
ences in Scrambles in the Alps (1871).
He published in 1892 Travels Among
the Great Andes of the Equator.
Whymper was by profession a wood-
engraver, and illustrated many books.

A.V.K.: (1) Many claims for
payment of war-time inventions which
had been patented have already been
settled on behalf of the Common-

the Attorney-General’s Department
and the claimants. Claims respecting
other patented inventions are at pre-
sent under discussion. (2) Other
claims have been received for war
inventions and ideas for which no
patents have been obtained and which
may involve some “ex gratia” pay-
ments. Attention is now being given
to this class of claims, though it is
expected that, because of the thorough
investigations which are necessary, it
is unlikely that early decisions will be
reached A.D.: Occasionally in-

YELLOW-
DENT
By
BRIAN JAMES
THE doctor came out that afternoon
much against the wishes of Mr.
Brady,
“I’ll be all right in a day or two,
you’ll see. I’ll be all right in the morn-
ing. What do you want to get the doctor
for? Besides, I must get on to the plant-
ing of that corn. Nearly too late now,
as it is.”
But Mrs. Brady was fearful. Her own
father had died —most stubbornly died —
because he wouldn’t see a doctor. Down
the years her mother had lived with the
regret—“A doctor might have saved
him.”
Perhaps a doctor might have, perhaps
not. Who knows? But her father had
died. Mrs. Brady was determined not to
take unneeded and avoidable risks.
The doctor said pneumonia. “No, no,
not hopeless at all. Don’t let him see you
think that. In any case, don’t think it.
Should be in hospital, of course; real
skilled nursing essential . . . Well, if you
could get Mrs. Swannel, good. She’s
a trained nurse. But don’t worry, and
don’t let him worry.”,
THE doctor, a trim piece of snippy-
snappy with a clipped moustache of
pepper and salt, and with a good deal of
pepper in the rest of him, went back again
to his patient.
“Look, Brady, you’ll be all right. In
a week or so. No, no, don’t try to argue
with me. I said a week or two. In the
meantime Mrs. Swannel will look after
you, and I’ll be out again soon. And
don’t worry about anything. Do you
hear? Well —what is it?”
“I must get that corn in, doctor.”
“Oh, you must, must you? And who
said you must?”
“But, doctor, surely in a few days”
“And didn’t I tell you in a week or
two?”
“Too late then, doctor.”
“Well, it’ll have to be, that’s all.”
When the doctor left, Mrs. Brady con-
tinued the argument. Brady, a thin
gaunt slab of a man, stuck to his necessity
to get in that corn. It was becoming an
obsession: that 10-acre paddock must be
planted out; he had yellow-dent all
ready for the planting. Yellow-dent was
sure to do well in the 10-acre. To hear
him one would think that life and fortune
depended on those 10-acres of corn.
It wasn’t as if Brady was so skilful a
farmer either. In fact, his hilly, rocky
farm had much the same scrawny look
as Brady himself. A hand to mouth
existence at best. There were the few
milkers, and a bit of a cheque from
them; a bit of fruit now and then from
the badly-tended orchard; a bit of oats
or wheat, as the case may be; and a bit
of lucerne from the irregular patch in
the gully.
Never more than a bare living, but
Brady loved the land in his own inefficient
way of tilling it, and he always had im-
possible visions of some stroke of luck
turning up —a big crop of something and
unheard of prices for it: the sheer lottery-
type of farming in which the prizes are
few and far between.
“But, Tom, as you say, the land is not
even ploughed yet. You’d have to give
it the go-by this year.”
“I could get one of the Farran boys
to plough it. I don’t want to miss that
corn. Yellow-dent, I said I was trying.”
“Think of the I mean, can we
You know The Farrans and all
that You Tcnow . . .”
Mr. Brady knew —it was the expense.
Money was short, and there would be
the doctor and Mrs. Swannel to pay.
Still, that made the corn more necessary.
“You don’t understand, Mary.”
*T think I do. And you mustn’t worry,
Dr. Small says so. Try to re-
sign yourself to that.”
Mrs. Brady had great faith
in telling people not to worry.
SHE was a tall woman, a trifle
faded, a trifle worn. Hair grey-
ing. Rather tired of the hopeless
struggle with the thin soil, and
droughts and prices, and other
attendant ill luck. No longer had
she any ambition for her own
generation, but was sustained by that for
the next. There was no blinking the fact
that her husband was a failure. If he
wasn’t a failure he’d have got off the land
ages ago. There was something pathetic
in his clinging to it —a confession that he
was no good for anything else —and no
good much for that either.
“It’s November now,” she said, “and
even if Bill Farr an did the ploughing, it
would be too late to get the ground
ready.”
“My idea was to sow as I ploughed—
every fourth furrow.”
“No good, surely, Tom, and you’ve
only just taken off the oats for hay.”
“You don’t understand, Mary.”
Mr. Brady went out to the kitchen,
where Mrs. Swannel was preparing some-
thing.
“1 do wish he’d stop worrying about
that corn,” said Mrs. Brady.
“Ah, now, but you must humor him
a bit —you must,” said Mrs. Swannel, She
was a stout middle-aged woman, always
threatening to grow out of .her stays.
Good-natured too in a firm get-along-
with-you fashion. She had a big red
face, very smooth, with a little humor-
ous twist at the comers of her large
mouth suggesting somehow that she
didn’t mind a broad sort of story, be there
a laugh in it.
“And I’ve just made a pot of tea, and
you’ll have one,” said she. Mrs. Swannel
greatly believed in tea, and she was treat-
ing Mrs. Brady as much a patient as her
husband.
“But that corn”
“Wist now, you and the corn! The
man’s delirious a bit, and you shouldn’t
take so much notice, and it’s getting on
ytour nerves, too, and that will get on
mine next —and where will you be then?”
“Oh, I hate the land,” said Mrs. Brady
in a helpless sort of way.
MRS. SWANNEL jerked a broad
thumb towards the front of the
house. “He’s all right, I’m telling you.
Quite all right, and you’re not to be upset-
ting yourself either. And what’s wrong
with the land all at once, may I ask?”
“Everything.”
“Stuff and nonsense, woman! Don’t
we all live from the land?” Mrs. Swannel
took in a large quantity of tea, rather
noisily.
“If it’s not one thing, it’s another.”
“You’re right there. True enough.
But wherever in life isn’t it so?—if it’s
not one thing it’s another.”
“My sister in Sydney”
“Yes, I know. Your sister in Sydney!
And never a worry she has, and nothing
ever goes wrong, so you’d say?”
Mrs. Brady winced. That sister in
Sydney had more than a fair share of
trouble. Big trouble. Far more than
a fair share of it.
“And you leave me alone with that
corn,” Mrs. Swannel went on between
gulps, “and his threat to get out and
plant it. Let me deal with that. And
don’t you worry a thing about it, or we’ll
have you sick too.”
Mrs. Brady went to the spare room,
and had a cry. A soft little hopeless cry
of self-pity. And even while she cried
she realised that she was breaking. She
was weak. Well enough to talk of the
heroic. But there needs to be some bless-
ings to count. And if Tom should die —
pneumonia was a serious thing. What’s
the use? #
JIM came in, home from school. Jim
was nearly fourteen and a fine bright
lad at that.
“Dead spit of his father,” people often
said, which nrp.y have been true; but he
was much better looking. He rode the
six miles to town every day to school,
where he might have some chance. Some
chance to do well for himself. Not much
of that even without money. < No pro-
fessions for poor boys. But Jim was
trying to get into the public service as
a junior. That would be something, an
opening. If he could pass the exam.
Anything better than the wretched land
—and all that silly stuff about The Women
of the West. Who wanted to be a woman
of the west?
“Hullo, Mum! How’s Dad?”
Mrs. Brady smiled wanly. “Not too
bad, Jim. Doctor’s been. No worse
really. But he’s working himself into
fits about putting in that corn.”
“I could stay home and do that, Mum.”
“And you won’t. I’m determined on
that. Once you start that you’ll be stay-
ing home for good. Or for bad,” she
added bitterly. “Your father would be
pleased enough too, but you are to go
for that exam. And you must get
through.”
“It would only be a week or so, Mum.
“No, it wouldn’t. It would be the end
of everything, and I know it.”
“I’d love to do it. I love the work.”
His mother shivered. Jim was all she
had —almost. There was Alice, nearly
ten. But her problems could wait till
later. Jim was the only present hope.
That night it came on to rain. There
was a storm, not a violent one, and after
it a gentle, persistent rain. It drummed
on the iron roof in pleasant monotony
through the night and all next day. Soft,
kindly November rain, an invitation to
all growing things to grow and be strong
and glad.
WHEN Dr. Small came again he said
to Mrs. Brady: “I do wish you could
do something about that corn. It’s driv-
ing him silly. Bad for hjm. He sweating
me with this stupid craze of his.”
“Couldn’t you” began Mrs, Brady.
“I can’t, that’s flat. A patient has to
come some of the way, you know.”
It looked like Jim staying home after
all. Mrs. Brady was resigning herself
to it. ,
“I know! ” said Jim to his mother. “It s
after full moon you know.”
“What on earth has that to do with
it?”
“You’ll see.” Nothing more to be got
out of him.
And that’s how the ploughing of the
10-acre commenced.
That evening Jim put Tub and Judy,
the medium draughts into the stable and
gave them a liberal allowance of chaff
and corn. Then he went to bed early.
He woke a little after two, and it must
have been some little surprise to Tub
and Judy to find themselves being led to
the 10-acre. That paddock was towards
the back of the farm, nearly a half-mile
from the house. There wasn’t much in
between —rocks and a steep hill.
Beyond the hill were 30-acres or so of
arable land, slopes and hollows, but still
some real soil. And beyond again a
high hill that was the eastern boundary.
The 10-acre sloped from this hill towards
a gully, where the lucerne grew.
It was red soil, iron-stained, plenty of
stone in it, no great depth of it, but good
soil, too. Though not as good for corn
as the river flats near town. Not nearly
so good.
There was a hay shed m a small yard
just outside the 10-acre, and close to the
slip-rails that opened into it. Here were
the harness, the plough and swinglebars.
It was a long, rakish-looking plough,
good for stony country. There was a
fairly new share on it.
Jim harnessed the horses and fastened
them to the bars, and throwing the plough
on its side he guided the horses with one
hand, and with the other grasped the
half sugar-bag of corn slung over his
shoulder. It was the yellow-dent,
reckoned a good all-round corn.
At the top end of the paddock he
stopped. What of a mark out? He was
not sure that he would see stakes with
white paper attached. Then he thought
of the cut out in the oat stubble—a dimple
in the ground, but discernible. Why not?
And it would save a lot of trouble. He
swung Tub and Judy round—Judy as
furrow horse —and the ploughing com-
menced under the stars, pale by the
bright November moon.
The share bit well, and the furrow
turned back, moist, fragrant, and neatly
rolling with the oat roots to hold it.

Face in the Carpet.
The good designer saw
In the field of his eye.
The eye of his mind,
The rose he meant to draw
As perfect as could be,
A rose without a flaw,
Faultlessly designed.
So, a prince among roses,
In the gay carpet it reposes.
Now, as the writer sits
Pausing, idling.
Not shepherding his wits,
Mooning at his desk.
His eye goes sidling.
Aimlessly stares,
Catches the poor rose unawares,
And sees instead
A ghoulish head,
A clown’s disrupted face
Slack-grinning and grotesque...
Did that other artist, far more great,
As he deep-brooding sat
Planning to create
Noble humanity
Slip like that
When drawing you or me?

Never grew up. And wasn’t it our wish:

To such evil ? But neither knew
I would pack them like kippers in my pocket.
It was that hooded photographer, 1 suppose.

But we arrived at my island; and I recount
How I could have eaten them all, at the time—
Even their father who held them at the font
Once, lovingly, chose cherished names for them;
All kept in mind like jewels in a diadem 1
But I preyed on the children in love's lesser pools,
Some snared in kelp, the lost minnows, shrimps
That darted like pangs of hunger, or spools
In a pattern of life I could sometimes glimpse
In the sea’s depths: sparing those cardboard
imps
Who laughed at me from stuffed pockets, of a
14
Past pretext of knowing now; whence 1 flung all
Weight of money, foibles, and from me hurled
Pretence of life as man. Beast —marsupial
Seemingly, which kept its young in thrall.
And, withal, I survived, I thought, their silly
angers —
The men who left me, without a mirror to age
me;
Stripped brain, and no more, whose constant
thoughts were fingers
Groping under blind rocks: no moods to enrage
me;
Only the outward storms; sea, sky, to encage
me.
And the palmtrees like waterspouts; the whales.
The dark islands spouting palmtrees of spray,
Were my wonder: and a thraldom fishing
compels
In these magic seas. Face of me like a sun
all day
In the fishes’ sky, deified, in its way,
This immortal mortal, durable as the rocks;
But for that covey of cherubs that he would
blaze , , ,
At with a hatred as for stopped clocks,
With imaginary guns; closing each one of his
days
With a whimper for real offspring, not paper
fays.

The British Labour Minister, in intro-
ducing the “1946 Assurance Companies
Act,” stated that “The 1946 Act”: —
“Acknowledges the inherently in-
ternational and comprehensive char-
acter of insurance.”
The Labour President of the Board of
Trade in the House of Commons also
stated that It would be proper to inform
the House of the attitude of the Labour
Government toward the future of British
Insurance business. The Government, he
stated, had no intention of interfering
with the transaction of Insurance business
by private enterprise. It is, he stated,
the desire of the Government that Insur-
ance should be, in the future, as in the
past, dealt with on an international basis
and as business of an international
character.

PALESTINE “ACHIEVEMENT.”
Dr, Evatt has described
U.N.O.’s partitioning of Pales-
tine as an “achievement.” In
the first fortnight the deathroll
was over 200. The figures have
been exaggerated in cables, but
at least about the same rate of
killings continues, and, apart
from those trying to lull very
doubtiftg second thoughts in
America by representing the
Arabs as bluffing, nobody any-
where suggests that what has
happened so far is anything but
a mild foretaste.
Indeed, the trumpeter of the
“achievement” runs some risk
now of acquiring the rather
dubious status of scapegoat.
Afterthought cables on January
9 reported: “Hopes held by the
Australian Minister for Ex-
ternal Affairs (Dr, Evatt) and
other United Nations delegates
that partition could possibly be
achieved without the organisa-
tion of an armed force are
clearly now not realisable.”
Further:
There is even criticism of Dr.
Evatt’s action as chairman of the
Palestine 'Commission in rushing
through the work of that body in
a wild scramble to return home after
the recent session of the General
Assembly.
It will be an odd twist if a
Canberra Christmas habit thus
becomes instrumental in Destiny.
U.N.O. Wobbles
Pending whatever amend-
ments Destiny may have in
mind, the final shape of U.N.O.’s
Palestine remains substantially
as shown here by map in B.
1/10/’47, with Jaffa, on Ameri-
can sponsorship, included in the
Arab portions of the much-
divided land. The finally agreed
allotments were:
Arab State: Area, 4500 sq. miles;
population, 804,000 Arabs and 10,000
Jews.
Jewish State: Area, 5500 sq. miles;
population, 397,000 Arabs and 538,000
Jews.
Enclave of Jerusalem:' Area, 289
sq. miles; population, 105,000 Arabs,
100,000 Jews.
In a London “Times” letter
R. R. Stokes, describing what
happened at Lake Success when
the decision was taken as “most
disturbing,” gives this account
of it:
Had the vote been taken on Nov.
26, as intended, partition would have
been defeated, 18 nations having de-
clared their intentions of voting
against and only 30 in favor. [There
had to be a two-thirds majority.] The
vote was deferred until November 29,
when the Philippines, Haiti and
Liberia, all of whom had declared
against partition on November 26,
turned round. China, who had de-
clared against, remained neutral, as
did Ethiopia, and France —on the
wobble on November 26 —voted in
favor on November 29. [He seems
to be wrong about China. It did
“abstain,” but had been reported as
indicating itself in favor.]
As one competent observer wrote,
“Gasps of satisfaction greeted the
affirmative votes of Haiti, Liberia and
the Philippines.” Earlier in the pro-
ceedings, when the legality of any
decision at all by the U.N. was de-
bated, 21 nations said “yes” and 20
“no”-—including New Zealand, who
voted in favor of partition on Nov.
29.
It is ironical that for the sake of
a domestic issue in America it may
well be proved that American capital
has been used to establish Com-
munism in the Middle East. Can
the U.N. survive this kind of treat-
ment?
A decidedly wobbly sort of
“achievement” ; the more so in
that the Assembly did not make
provision for enforcement: all
it could do was to ask the
Security Council to assume
responsibility “if a threat to the
peace should develop” ; meaning
if the Arabs inside and outside
Palestine should carry out their
threats. Internal disturbances
were to be handled by armed
militia recruited by the provi-
sional councils of government of
the two States. A report by a
N. Y. “Times” U.N.O. corre-
spondent throws light on why
the Assembly did not provide for
outside military force;
Some members, including apparently
the United States, kept thinking until
the last that the British would back
down on their announcement that
they would not allow British troops
to be used to enforce any solution
unless it was satisfactory to both
Jews and Arabs.
The trouble about recruiting an
international force from scratch was
that the small Powers did not have
—N. Y. “Herald Tribune.”
SURE, GET RIGHT ON AND RIDE HIM.
( U.S. views on Palestine have greatly changed.)
the forces available, and were not
willing to send them anyway; and
if the great Powers sent troops, that
might give the Soviet Union a chance
to establish itself in a strategic centre
of the strategic Near East. Besides,
the United States State Department
did not think that Congress would
agree to the sending of United States
troops.
The result was that the United
States at first proposed the formation
of an international constabulary force
recruited on an individual basis. This
obviously was unworkable, and the
United States along with the other
supporters of partition then decided
to depend on the armed militia in the
respective States for keeping internal
order.
If ever anything sounded like
palpable weakness that does, for
all the ballyhooing of the
“achievement.” Just how weak
it is may be seen from a brief
listing of the forces Britain has
been using merely to keep the
peace under its mandate, with
no Arab terrorism to combat:
Regular Army: 70,000 British
ground troops plus about 6000 mem-
bers of the Royal Air Force.
Palestinian police: 3000 Britons,
23,400 Arabs (including units of the
British-officered Arab Legion of
Transjordan, which was called into
Palestine during the war for police
duty), 4900 Jews.
No U.S. Troops
Britain is to end its mandate
not later than May 15 (prob-
ably before that date). Sup-
porters of partition have been
quoted as thinking the crucial
period will, come after the in-
dependence of the two States is
proclaimed ; British authorities
—who ought to know —are re-
ported as thinking the severest
test will come between the ter-
mination of the mandate and the
proclamation of the two States
as independent (set down for
not later than October 1),
Meanwhile, even in finding
suitable men to represent them
on the commission which is to
execute the partitioning the five
“little nations” selected
Czechoslovakia, Bolivia, Den-
mark, Panama and the Philip-
pines ; a wonderful assortment
for such a job—had consider-
able difficulty: a matter, as a
London “Times” correspondent
has put it, of “finding men of
the requisite calibre willing to
undertake what is obviously
going to be difficult and deli-
cate, if not dangerous, work.”
One thing, America is now
being much better informed on
Palestine than it has been
throughout Britain’s holding of
the mandate. In consequence
there is apparent a much clearer
sense of responsibility than had
hitherto been evident, with, as
a main feature, insistence in
practically every American
quarter that whatever happens
U.S. troops must not be used!
The quarters that have been
loudest in criticising Britain ap-
parently dare not raise a voice
against this practically unani-
mous American “No.” And to
the British that must be grimly
funny.
In the past U.S. policy on
Palestine was largely dictated by
Presidential - election politics,
and, as recorded by “World Re-
port,” this is still likely to oper-
ate, though in a reverse order:
American troops may be requested
by the United Nations to enforce
partition on the Arabs. The request
would be natural, since the United
States was the chief advocate of par-
tition in the U.N. Assembly. But
Washington officials doubt whether
Congress, in an election year, would
authorise the move.
Instead, so trustworthy a
source as N.Y. “Times” has
actually reported (December 5)
the United States having
“sounded out China” —of all
places!—about the possibility
of Chinese troops being sent to
Palestine. “At this stage,” said
the report, “the discussions in-
volve 2000 to 3000 Chinese
troops,” with the forlorn addi-
tion: “There was no indication
of any response from Nanking.”
Such service to the Cause as
the N. Y. “Post” screamline
heading “British Stand By and
Jeer While Jerusalem Riots”
(December 2) would seem to be
finding Uncle Sam most dis-
obligingly deaf.
Arabs Blame U.S.
As an example of the better
information the U.S. is now be-
latedly getting, the “American
Magazine” has run a long article
by King Abdulla of Trans-
jordan, leaving Americans no
room for doubting where Arabs
feel the blame for the partition
mostly belongs. Incidentally,
“World Report” has sheeted this
home to a single person:
The position of the United States
favoring creation of a Jewish nation
m Palestine was decided by President
Truman. Some of the conclusions
he reached were not in full accord
with the recommendations of Sec-
retary of State George C. Marshall
and varied from the ideas of military
advisers who are concerned about
endangering Arabian oil supplies.
Be that as it may. King Ab-
dulla spread the blame on to
America in general:
There is one thing the Arab world
simply cannot understand. Of all the
nations of the earth, America is most
insistent that something be done for
the suffering Jews of Europe. This
feeling does credit to the humanity
for which America is famous, and to
that glorious inscription on your
Statue of Liberty. And yet this same
America —the richest, greatest, most
powerful nation the world has ever
known —refuses to accept more than
a token handful of these same Jews
herself!
I believe that you do not realise
how directly you are, as a nation,
responsible in genera! for the whole
Zionist move and specifically for the
present terrorism
Quite aside from official American
support for the “National Home” of
the Balfour Declaration, the Zionist
settlements in Palestine would have
been almost impossible, on anything
like the current scale, without
American money. This was contri-
buted by American Jewry in an
idealistic effort to help their fellows.
The motive was worthy; the results
were disastrous. The contributions
were by private individuals, but they
were almost entirely Americans, and,
as a nation, only America can answer
for it.
The present catastrophe may be laid
almost entirely at your door. Your
Government, almost alone in the
world, is insisting on the immediate
admission of 100,000 more Jews into
Palestine —to be followed by countless
additional ones. This will have the
most frightful consequences in bloody
chaos beyond anything ever hinted
at in Palestine before.
It is your press and political leader-
ship, almost alone in the world, who
press this demand.
It is almost entirely American
money which hires or buys the
“refugee ships” that steam illegally
toward Palestine; American money
which pays their crews. The illegal
immigration from Europe is arranged
by the Jewish Agency, supported
almost entirely by American funds.
It is American dollars which sup-
port the terrorists, which buys the
bullets and pistols that kill British
soldiers —your allies —and Arab citi-
zens—your friends.
We in the Arab world were stunned
to hear that you permit open adver-
tisements in newspapers asking for
money to finance these terrorists, to
arm them openly and deliberately
for murder. We could not believe
this could really happen in the
modern world. Now we must be-
lieve ; we have seen the advertisements
with our own eyes
What would your answer be if
some outside agency told you that
you must accept in America many
millions of utter strangers in your
midst enough to dominate your
country —merely because they insisted
on going to America, and because
their forefathers had once lived there
some 2000 years ago?
Our answer is the same.
And what would be your action
if, in spite of your refusal, this out-
side agency began forcing them on
you?
Ours will be the same.
As an addendum to that,
“World Report” declares that
“American prestige in the Arab
world is at its lowest point in
history.”
Worse Ahead
America is now hearing
from its own press correspon-
dents on anything but reassur-
ing lines. Few American papers
could stand up to an examina-
tion for past bias on this issue,
but N, Y. “Times,” for one, is
now publishing objective reports.
One from its Cairo correspon-
dent lately opened with “There
is one thing that grows more
certain as each day passes, and
that is that the Arabs are not
bluffing.” Indeed, the Arabs,
this correspondent reported, had
been “deeply hurt” by earlier
statements in America that
“their threats of reprisal, are all
talk”:
They have already laid comprehen-
sive plans to defend integrity, honor,
pride and what they believe to be
their own Palestine. They are pre-
pared to defy the world, if need be,
to prevent the creation of a Jewish
State in Palestine. The Arab States
have decided to send their armies to
man the Palestine border and will
send them in if Zionists receive out-
side military aid. They are sending
recruits to the “Arab People’s Army,”
which will be the source of guerrilla
warfare to come. And they have
established a $4,000,000 fund to help
Palestinian Arabs and provide them
with arms and ammunition.
The Arabs are well organised under
military leaders and are being trained
in commando units rather than in
haphazard guerrilla fashion. Their
purpose is to keep Palestine in a
continuous state of turmoil, to dis-
rupt anything approaching normal life
there and by widespread assaults on
transportation and arterial highways
to prevent Jewish settlements from
delivering their products to Palestine
markets.
The same newspaper’s corre-
spondent in Jerusalem has' re-
ported observers there as “vir-
tually unanimous in the belief
that the chances of serious and
prolonged fighting in Palestine
have been dangerously under-
rated in America and elsewhere.”
Further insisting that “there is
no shred of doubt about the in-
tensity of the Arab resentment,”
the correspondent added: “What
appears obviously true is that
barring some third force here —
whether British or United
Nations or Abdulla’s army—

there will be terrifying disorder
after the British withdrawal.”
One thing is certain regarding
that —whatever kind of army it
is it will not be British. The
second thoughts now worrying
Americans include speculation
on what kind of army it will be,
with, as in most other respects,
Russia the bugbear. In a listing
of doubtful points in U.S.-Soviet
relations, “Christian Science
Monitor” Washington repre-
sentative Roscoe Drummond
puts as “of greatest importance”
the question: “Will Russia sup-
port in detail the authority and
the decision of the U.N. to carry
out the partition of Palestine?”
A Russia willing in that would,
however, be a most mixed bless-
ing ; the U.S. decidedly dislikes
the idea of having Russian
troops in Palestine on any pre-
text.
As for the Soviet agreement
on partition, this has probably
been most accurately referred to
by former Egyptian Minister to
Washington M. Amine Youssef
in a London “Times” letter:
“My copsidered opinion is that
Russia is counting on an Arab
revolt against.... .all foreigners:
an Arab wave of xenophobia.”
The big U.S. stake in Arab oil
is another issue involving
Russia, a N. Y. “Times” Lon-
don correspondent reporting on
it: “Russia quite naturally has
beep trying desperately to ob-
tain a share... .It would be sur-
prising if the Russians failed to
take advantage of unsettled con-
ditions in the Middle East fol-
lowing the partition of Palestine
to advance their interests.”
A Washington correspondent
of the same newspaper has
quoted “a high U.S. Army
officer” as stating that “the U.S.
General Staff is gravely con-
cerned about a possibility that
Soviet troops would move into
the Holy Land under the pretext
of preventing bloodshed be-
tween Jews and Arabs over par-
tition.”
Which, as members of that
General Staff might say, would
be some achievement!
British-Soviet Trade.
As announced by President of
the British Board of Trade J. H.
Wilson (and if everything goes
as announced), Britain will be
shipping heavy machinery to
Russia under the temporary
trade pact “in return for between
500,000 and 750,000 tons of
barley, corn and oats,” to be
used for animal feed.
Commenting on the deal, and
the further announcement that
Wilson will be going to Moscow
in May “to conclude a long-
term agreement,” N. Y. “Times”
has pointed out that whereas in
1937 Britain did $194,513,264
worth of business with Russia
and $625,763,512 with the
United States, in the first nine
months of 1947, Anglo-Soviet
trade totalled $67,000,000,
Anglo - American trade
$919,600,000.
Mentioning that that “heavy
post - war dependence upon
America—-where goods must be
bought with hard-to-get dollars
—is one of the obstacles to
Britain’s post-war recovery,”
N. Y. “Times” sees a twofold
significance in the British an-
nouncement :
First, it represented a step away
from Britain’s dependence upon
America and indicated that Britain
now may be able to expand her trade
elsewhere in the Soviet sphere (a
$240,000,000 Anglo-Polish accord was
reached last summer). Second, the
announcement suggested that, despite
Russia’s efforts to prove the self-
sufficiency of her sphere, she acknow-
ledges her dependence on the West.
In this sense the agreement is an
important one in European recovery.
The Marshall Plan’s I success, its
authors say, will depend to a large
extent on whether or not East-West
trade can be brought back to post-
war levels.
“World Report” points out
that, despite the widening of the
political break between the East
and the West spheres in Europe,
goods worth $1,400,000,000 a
year are at present being ex-
changed between them “under 71
bilateral agreements signed since
the war.” Adding that “trade
between countries on opposite
sides of the Iron Curtain is
larger this year than last,” it
points out also that “major in-
creases in East-West trade were
predicted in the revised Marshall
Plan” now up for U.S. Congress
decision: “Economic gains for
both sides are proving too ad-
vantageous to be rejected for
political reasons.”
Belgians Knew How.
Under this heading, “Wall-
street Journal’s” very able
correspondent in Europe, Joseph
E. Evans, looks into the where-
for of a phenomenon of national
recovery in the midst of coun-
tries still making very heavy
weather of it:
It is taken practically for granted
in the non-Copimunist economic and
political circles of Europe that, as
far as the Continent is concerned,
the traditional system of free com-
petitive private enterprise is finished.
The war, leaving Europe destroyed,
prostrate and destitute, is seen as
having dug the last bit of earth for
that system’s grave. Only through
ever-increasing State economic con-
trol, one is given to believe, can
Europe revive or even survive. On
the political side it is pointed out
that the most vehement opponents of
Communism in Europe are the
Socialists, and they in turn are the
targets of the Communists’ most acid
attacks.
America, it is argued, must
endeavor to understand this elemen-
tary fact of European life and must
above all not commit the tragic error
of conditioning aid to Europe on
the degree to which the receiving
nations’ economies approximate its
own. Non-Communist Europe is, in
the general view, unalterably com-
mitted to Socialism; like it or not,
there are no two ways about it.
To this theory Belgium offers a
grand one might properly say a
joyous—refutation. Here is a country
which has given its people the high-
est post-war standard of European
living, which has overwhelmed its
population with a material abundance
of everything from simple necessities
to fantastic luxuries. And it has
done so by deliberately rejecting the
dismally prevailing economic policies
of control, austerity and State owner-
ship of industry.
As one looks at the other nations
of Europe—Socialist England, where
austerity is of necessity giving way
to something far more grim; Socialist
France, shattered by economic and
political strife clearly foreshadowing
civil war; Socialist - Communist
Czechoslovakia, where all the incen-
tives and two-year plans and
nationalisation cannot get the people
really to work —as one views these
tormented nations, it is extremely dif-
ficult to avoid the impression that
Belgium’s prosperity is in direct pro-
portion to the degree it has eschewed
.practical Socialist economies.
Sister Kenny.
Heading it “A High Tribute
to a Gracious Lady,” N, Y.
“Journal - American” gave a
leading article to the Michigan
Foundation’s “impressive cere-
monies in Detroit” in honor of
Sister Kenny, “the Australian
nurse who has become one of
the most loved and respected
women in the world. v
In the Detroit ceremonies “the
highest officials of the State and
a great throng of people partici-
pated with warm enthusiasm and
a deep sense of appreciation and
affection,”
The “Journal - American”
added its own tribute:
Sister Kenny is a woman of re-
markable skill and initiative and re-
source in her profession, and of rare
and admirable spiritual concepts, and
of indefatigable energy and superlative
courage.
She has pitted her talents and faith
against a monstrous enemy of man-
kind, and has prevailed against it
in a marvellous and almost miraculous
degree.
She has been opposed by the
narrow prejudices and reluctance to
accept change and suspicion of pro-
gressive innovations which have im-
peded medical science throughout its
history, and has refused to be
obstructed. [Sister Kenny’s methods
have several times been very hotly
criticised by American medical
authorities.]
She has made her revolutionary
and beneficial method of treatment
a boon of humanity, and in con-
sequence of that service to mankind
has a monument of reverent gratitude
in the hearts of men and women and
children delivered by her ministrations
from anguish and despair.
Brighter Olympics.
The International Olympics
Committee having apparently
given up hope of having Soviet
competitors at the Games this
year, Chicago “Tribune” holds
that the fault may have been
with the committeemen, who
“probably were so stuffy as to
insist that the Games be con-
ducted in the traditional man-
ner.” A few “Tribune” sugges-
tions :
A party line walking contest might
have been added, providing a much
more interesting spectacle than the
usual tiresome 10-mile walk, always
in the same direction. A looting
contest also would have given the
Russians opportunity to show special
skill.
Rules for certain events of the
traditional games could have been
adapted to the training of the Rus-
sian youths. The marathon race now
covers only 26 miles and 385 yards.
It might have been extended to 1200
miles, the distance covered both ways
by Russian troops in their epic race
with the Germans.
The high jump could have been
improved by requiring competitors to
leap over barbed-wire fences of con-
centration camps instead of over
prosaic bamboo poles.
The Olympic committee’s failure to
grant concessions to the Russian
sporting ideology places the com-
mittee in the ranks of deviationist
wreckers, dollar-mad capitalist im-
perialists, and warmongers. How can
we expect to get along with Russia
on the political level if we can’t even
meet them half way on such a minor
matter as the Olympic games?
Atomic Horrifies.
Apparently the horrific possi-
bilities of the atomic bomb have
so far been only glimpsed. A
report in N. Y. “Herald Tri-
bune” has attributed to a Cali-
fornia Institute of Technology
scientist a claim to the “first
laboratory confirmation of the
theory that exposure to an
atomic bomb can lead to inherit-
able defects which may produce
human deformities in Japan for
the next 1000 years.”
The scientist was reported as
stating that it was now almost a
certainty that exposure to radio-
activity affects the inheritance
factors in cell tissue.
It may take a long time to be-
come apparent in humans, he
said, but “affected genes and
chromosomes in some Japanese
people may result in the birth
of morons, cripples and de-
formed progeny in future gener-
ations. The damage done by
outright killing at Hiroshima
and Nagasaki may be but the
smallest part of the damage
wrought by the atomic bomb.”
Dragnet Digest.
Leopold. —ln case anyone should
wonder what’s become of him, Bel-
gium’s King Leopold is still living
in exile in Switzerland. , Belgian
Socialist and Communist leaders
oppose his return. Prime Minister
Spaak has stated, referring to Leo-
pold’s haying said he was ready to
resume his job subject to a public
statement proclaiming that his honor
was “unblemished” during and after
the German invasion: “This is not
the manner in which the problem
presents itself in Belgium. It is not
a problem of the King’s honor. What
divides Belgians is a political
problem.” That division, it is held,
would become pronounced if Leo-
pold returned, seriously retarding
Belgium’s remarkable progress in
recovery.
* * * *
War Talk. —There is, says “World
Report,” so much war talk in the
U.S. that it has profoundly shocked
Washington. The talk referred to is
not that in papers, which would seem
prevalent enough, but is that current
in business circles and industrial
centres. “It does not come from
rabble-rousers. It is from respon-
sible people who are worried. They
are doing this talking quietly, among
themselves. They fear war between
Russia and the United States in two
or three years, maybe less; they are
not talking about a conflict 10 to 20
years away. There is no enthusiasm,
no yearning to start dropping atomic
bombs in Stalin’s backyard. Attitude
is becoming one of resignation to the
inevitable. Nobody expects the U.S.
to start the shooting. General assump-
tion is that the Russians will start
things, wherever and whenever they
choose.”

Flor de Cabbajz. —Present tobacco
prices being too much for them, still
more British smokers, according to
a “Wall-street Journal” London cor-
respondent, are turning to herb's. A
popular mixture consists of equal pro-
portions of coltsfoot and red clover
flowers; not home-made, but marketed
at about quarter the price of tobacco:
“Makers of herbal mixtures report
such phenomenal demand that stocks
are either exhausted or have been
severely rationed to distributors.” In
a line of understatement which even
the British themselves couldn’t better,
the correspondent adds that “the
peculiar odor associated with smoul-
dering herbs makes such smokers
unpopular with their friends and
neighbors,”

Police v. Corns. Addressing the
550 police chiefs gathered for the
annual conference of their Inter-
national Association, U.S. Republican
Presidential aspirant Harold E. Stassen
urged them to give “special attention
toward clearing up Communist in-
filtration in America.” He said: “Do
not underestimate the importance of
this task. It can have a major effect
upon the greatest problem of our
time, the relations between the United
States and Russia. In my judgment,
if the Politburo of the Soviet Union
beobmes convinced that it is impos-
sible to successfully infiltrate the
United States, this will be one of the
factors which may lead to a change
for the better in their foreign policy.”
* * * *
U.S. Intelligence Service. Two
claims that Uncle Sam is not lagging
in a highly specialised field (its diplo-
matic name is “foreign intelligence”)
in which J. Bull has always been
pretty good: (1) In a “Foreign
Affairs” article, John J. McCloy,
commenting on the war-winning ex-
ploits of U.S. submarines against the
Japs, states that “Admiral Nimitz
took fine advantage of the help which
his excellent ‘intelligence’ gave him.”
(2) “Christian Science Monitor” chief
Washington correspondent Roscoe
Drummond reports that the U.S. State
Department was “not caught off bal-
ance” by the announcement of the
revival of the Comintern: “Officials
here [Washington] had full advance
intelligence of what was coming.”
* * * *
U.S.-Soviet Trade Drop.—Accord-
ing to “World Report,” “Russian
purchasers are finding it increasingly
difficult to buy goods in the United
States.” The earlier American efforts
to boost U.S.-Russian trade “are
being abandoned.” Instead, U.S.
products “are being funnelled to
Western Europe.” Machinery is
among the things Russia is finding it
hard to buy—the reverse of the good
old lend-lease times.
Jfc * *
Too Much Gold. —Stating that im-
ports of gold into the U.S. have
increased sixfold in a year, “World
Report” comments that this “in-
flationary flow,” now running at the
rate of $3 billion a year, is causing
increasing concern in Washington:
“The Treasury wants no more gold.
But purchases cannot be stopped
without threatening the value of
bullion already bought—almost $23
billion worth. Now there is a danger
that gold shipments from other
countries may increase further.”
Hs * - * *
Many Jewish Parties. —It isn’t only
Palestine itself that is much-divided:
a N. Y. “Times” correspondent in
Jerusalem reports on the Jews there
as “by no means unanimous in their
political views.” He adds that “even
on the major question of indepen-
dence there is a large dissenting body,
and in general the Jews are divided
into approximately 30 parties of all
shades of political opinion from Com-
munists to extreme Right Wing.”
* * * *
An Optimist Abroad. —Back from
a long visit to Europe, the Arizona
“Daily Star’s” editor, William R.
Mathews, cast up in the Washington
“Post” columns feeling mostly opti-
mistic: “Europe is not going to hell,
for a while at least; it is not going
Communist, although we shall see
numerous Communist scares: there is
not going to be war, but we may do
some shooting to maintain our posi-
tions in Berlin and Greece.” He said
he felt “pessimistic about Palestine,”
but “the coming war in Palestine can
be localised.” Chief ground for his
general cheerfulness: “Although
Russia has been getting away with the
biggest bluff in history, she cannot go
to war.”

HOLLWAY'S VICTORY.
Firmness by the Hollway Cabinet in
Melbourne won the day for the public’s
rights, the recognition of constituted
authority and the rule of law. At the
last moment the Communists squibbed.
Their hand in engineering the latest
attempt to throw Victoria into anarchy
was open and undisguised, and the good
sense of many unionists and their leaders
in refusing to accept the Communist cry
of “an attack on trade-unionism” did
much to defeat the conspiracy: that,
and the healthy effect of action by a
Government game to stand up to the in-
dustrial bushrangers who have long
ravaged Australian industry.
Communists and near-Communists
lined up immediately to exploit the tram-
ways and feeder-bus stoppage initiated
under the leadership of the Communist
union secretary O’Shea. There was the
Communist Brown, boss of the State
Railwaymen’s Union, who during the
transport strike (under the Cain “Labor”
Government) last year arrogated to him-
self the right to issue permits for buses
to run on the streets. At the instance of
kindred spirits, enginedrivers, iron-
workers, wharfies, seamen and the build-
ing unions all came in. With one
accord, as though at a given signal, they
announced their intention to support the
striking tram- and bus-men, partly in
order to put some ginger into a strike
that did not look like living long, and
partly as an effort to frighten the State
Government—as “ ‘Labor’ Governments”
had been frightened—-into abandoning its
plans for emergency legislation.
At Canberra Mr. Chifley seemed dis-
posed to enjoy the fun from a box-seat.
Ha remarked that the “dispute” would be
a test of the Hollway Government. Mr.
Hollway took that cue instantly. He
agreed entirely and added that the Prime
Minister’s remark showed that the strike
was political in essence and would be
met as such. The Liberal Premier made a
last gesture to the Melbourne and Metro-
politan Tramway Board employees to
reconsider their position, undertaking that
if they did the passage of his bill through
Parliament should proceed slowly. But
when the Government railway electrical
staff threatened an instant power-house
stoppage against the bill, the measure was
introduced, debated and passed.
Immediately the provisions became
known the hitherto bold union bosses
bolted for cover. The preparations to
resist provisions for running emergency
transport to protect the public—the Com-
munists’ earlier target —gave way to real
alarm at the clauses requiring a secret
ballot before any strike and fixing fines
of £lOOO on union leaders and £5O on
individual strikers concerned (lighter
fines for picketing) in an unlawful
stoppage.
As soon as the Trades Hall began to
register dismay, Mr. Hollway played a
master-move. The Trades Hall secretary
told the story, reporting back to his
executive:
Wa asked the Government to withdraw
the bill, but the Premier told us calmly
and coolly that the Cabinet refused. But
he said the bill would not be proclaimed
if normal transport services were operating
by Monday.
Then “the cat began to eat the rat, the
rat began to gnaw the rope”—and so on.
The secretary of the enginedrivers, who a
short time before was pulling the joker
out of his sleeve that would trump all
suburban-train suits, announced hastily
that he “would work all night to get some
of the strikers back for the morning.”
(Trains had all stopped at midnight.)
The seamen seemed to be of a like mind.
Communist Brown, of the railways, was
struck silent. The ironworkers made so
little sign of being present anywhere that
they might have removed to Mars. A
process had also been found by which the
Conciliation Commissioner could get to
work —namely, with the Federal body of
the tramway union, with which the Vic-
torian body will have to conform or be
outlawed.
With these manoeuvres the victory of
the Hollway Government is salutary for
more than the immediate ends. It has
not only quelled an attack on the com-
munity by industrial dervishes, but it has
also shown the electors that there is
real prospect of some orderly life and
authority in the country under a Govern-
ment which does not habitually surrender
to insolent union “demands.” The vic-
tory will be driven home if the public—
as may be expected—rallies to the active
support of such a policy. In addition to
these benefits the Victorian Parliament
has now placed on the statute-book a
law which will enable every future strike
against the community to be challenged
with effect, especially on such issues as
those raised by the late strike:
Employees in a publicly-owned transport
service, led by one of the Communists (in
this case O’Shea) who have made publicly-
owned transport services their special prey,
refused to recognise the authority of the
management.
They rejected the remodelled Federal
arbitration machinery, devised to short-
circuit disputes, and resorted to force —
“direct action,” in the “Labor” and Com-
munist jargon.
Other unions of Government “servants”
declared their support for this attitude to
the extent of urging resistance to Parlia-
mentary counter-action at the Government’s
instance, and picketing against Government
emergency services.
The union policy, one of blackmail
against the Government, was to threaten
stoppage of transport services unless the
Government yielded to union “demands” —•
the term employed by strike-leaders again
and again.
The Victorian Government had an-
nounced that the Tramway Board was
ready to submit its temporary 40-
hour-week roster (the pretext for the
strike) to the Conciliation Commissioner’s
judgment, as is provided by the 40-hour-
week award. The strikers rejected every
advance. O’Shea said his union was “not
even thinking of a settlement.”
From the record of this effort to pro-
duce anarchy the public may judge the
drift in abdication of authority to the
unions under “Labor” Administrations
during recent years. In no instance of the
perpetual union defiance of constituted
authority under “Labor” did the
Chifley, McGirr or Cain “Governments”
(while the Cain “Government” was in
office) call Parliament together to place
the issue under the spotlight of respon-
sible debate, as a preliminary to effectual
executive action. Under “Labor” the
only stand mobilised was that by the
unions, and after long delays “Labor”
Ministers would generally “fix” the dis-
pute in private talks at the Trades Halls,
with every psychological advantage on
the side of the industrial rebels. In-
evitably such “Governments” surrendered
every time, and Ministers even flattered
themselves on having restored to an ex-
asperated public the functioning of essen-
tial services on the strikers’ terms.
Under this disposition to abdicate to
union demands —excused by Mr. Chifley,
for instance, with the disgraceful ex-
planation that he “refused to crucify the
workers,” meaning that his “policy” is
“the union, right or wrong”—“Labor”
has sacrificed more than that constitu-
tional authority of Cabinet which it took
oath to maintain. It has wasted also much
of the prestige won for the arbitration
system ; and in the result the new-model,
“streamlined,” conciliation-commissioner
system. It has permitted unions for
years to hold this country to ransom for
their own ends, with unwritten licence to
use force (“direct action”) to gain any-
thing they wanted. The travelling public,
householders, indeed all taxpayers, have
paid the cost. “Labor’s” industrial
“policy,” accepted by the political wing,
though not always in Queensland, has
been that “might is right.”
Last year, when Melbourne was de-
prived of normal railway and bus trans-
port for many weeks, Mr. Menzies put
the position plainly to a South Malvern
meeting. He said:
We ought not to permit people who can
go to the Arbitration Court [and who can
now invoke the new conciliation system
which Dr. Evatt said would do the trick]
to resort to direct action. We have suc-
cumbed too long to this claptrap about the
right to strike being sacred. I deny in any
man that right which enables him to in-
jure his neighbor.
This is doubly true of strikes in essential
services run under Government control
as monopolies, where strikes are aimed
not against profit-seeking employers, but
directly against the public, both as users
and as taxpayers who have to carry the
annual losses aggravated by strike disloca-
tions.
Those 1947 strikes in Melbourne and
elsewhere were attributed by “Labor” —
its industrial or its political wing or both
—to the pegging of wages, to the clamor
for the 40-hour week, to delays in arbitra-
tion hearings. All these causes of “in-
dustrial unrest” have been remedied, says
“Labor’s” own sympathetic “Govern-
ment” at Canberra; “industrial unrest”
remains. The new “streamlined” arbitra-
tion model, even with “Labor’s” own
appointees to run it —and nearly all the
new Conciliation Commissioners were
appointed from Trades Halls and other
“Labor” haunts —is becoming as con-
temptible in the unions’ eyes as the
former Arbitration Court system. It is
not anticipating and short-circuiting
strikes. It has not, and cannot have.
without reinforcement of those penalties
for defiance which Dr. Evatt refused to
countenance, any more power than the
old system to curb strikes against awards,
into which category most strikes currently
fall.
What the Victorian Government’s
action has shown is the value of healthy
punitive action in law against union
bosses who are prepared to defy tribunals,
Governments and public needs with
equal impudence.
The Missing Ingredient.
The Federal “Labor” Ministry works in
mysterious ways, among which nothing is
more mysterious than its way with de-
fence. Its defence “policy” is something
isolated from that of the rest of the
world in that it consists mainly of words
without backing.
King Boria Bungalee 800, whose
“shout was a hullabaloo, his whisper a
horrible yell,” had nothing on the
Chifley “Government” when it is engaged,
through the medium of a hypnotised
press, in telling the world how it is going
to confound its enemies, and how im-
mense is the expenditure involved. But
when the realities of its measures are
examined they appear about as effective
as those of a frilled lizard.
If an invader who attacks this country
can be persuaded to fight with his ears,
he will be doomed from the start. If he
has anything more lethal to offer he is
in for a walkover, provided the Chifleys
are in power and there is no time for the
United States and Britain to come to the
rescue.
The latest “plans” produced by Cabinet
contain nothing new, save the introduc-
tion of a new sub-committee, such bodies
being the refuge of the Cabinet whenever
it desires to avoid doing anything. The
sub-committee is to consist of Mr.
Chifley, a “returned soldier” of the 1917
railway strike, Mr, Dedman, Mr.
Lemmon —an answer to himself only—
and Senator Cameron, who, in his more
alert moments, seems like a reminiscence
of that old Duke of Devonshire who
dreamt that he was making a speech in
the House of Lords and woke up to find
that he was.
This group of intelligentsia has assumed
the duty of studying the complicated and
highly technical problem of defence
against the atom bomb and guided
missiles, which, as it has heard, can now
be fired accurately half-way round the
earth.
The sub-committee proposes to consider
how buildings should be strengthened and
how industry should be dispersed, streng-
thening and dispersion being necessary,
as the “Government” believes, though
actually such a measure, carried out
effectively, would be so expensive as to
be impracticable.
Particular attention is to be paid to
Darwin, an obsession with all Govern-
ments, but in actual modern defensive
strategy now about as important to the
defence of Australia as Nome or Lima.
There will be consideration of “new
A.R.P. precautions to protect civilians.”
And, as an agreeable novelty, “a closer
watch is to be kept on Sydney Reds,” a
task which should be easy in view of the
thorough honeycombing of “the move-
ment” with those gentry and fellow-
travellers. But there is no mention of
dismissal from the C.S.I.R. of a
Communist who was prosecuted and sen-
tenced in war-time and recommended for
internment until the end of the war.
Rewards are to be offered ; as much as
£2ooo—equal to a second-prize in one
of N.S.W. “Labor’s” “special” Govern-
ment lotteries —for the discovery of
atomic minerals. And, as earnest of its
seriousness, the “Government” an-
nounced that it was buying nine and a
half acres of land in the very heart and
most bombable part of Melbourne on
which it proposes to concentrate large
blocks of Federal offices, and was con-
templating a similar purchase in Phillip-
street, Sydney. This on the very day
on which its alarmist pronunciamento
was issued from Canberra, and the day
before Mr. Johnson, the sage who con-
trols the Interior Department, had
trumpeted that need for the atomic-
defence plan was “urgent”; “we must
make an early decision.”
According to Mr, Johnson, the Cabinet
had “been influenced by the re-
cent deterioration of the international
situation.” Mr. Chifley threw a bit of
fuel into the fire of the general alarm by
stating that it would probably be neces-
sary to strengthen the foundations of the
£1,425,000 block of Government build-
ings proposed for Canberra. This indi-
cates the measure of Mr. Chifley’s know-
ledge of atom bombs, blasting power of
which is not nearly so deadly as their
heat and their poison.
The whole of the “defence pro-
gramme,” as outlined so far (including
even a tentative scheme to build naval
vessels larger than destroyers), reads like
a creation of a body nominated from the
staff of the “Boys’ Adventure” magazine
and presided over by one of the news-
paper strategists who, in 1942, were
shouting for somebody td' send a few
Russian generals to North Africa to teach
British generals their business.
It is impossible for Australia to make
any large-scale contribution to atom
science under present conditions for at
least two years. None of the Govern-
ments which possess the basic secrets of
atom technique are at all likely to reveal
them to an Administration which has
shown time and again that it comes
whenever called by Communist-controlled
unions, whose leaders avow their
allegiance to the only country which can
conceivably render defence against atom
and guided-missile attack necessary
within measurable time.
In the second place, Mr. Chifley and
the armchair experts of his Cabinet are
utter, though pretentious, amateurs.
Their conceptions of what the atom bomb
is and what guided missiles are, and their
preoccupation with -the politically con-
venient idea of a push-button war, which
could be won defensively by going under-
ground or mere dispersal, have been
shattered by Dr. Vannevar Bush, head of
the U.S. Office of Scientific Research and
Development, which actually produced
the atom bomb, “from dirt to explosion”;
Push-button warfare be damned! This
talk does a lot of harm. People who think
in terms of pushing the button lose sight
of the fact that, if there were a war
tomorrow, it would be the same tough
slugging match that the last one was.
This entirely accords with the convic-
tions of most experienced officers. For
example, Major-General James M. Gavin,
who commanded the 82nd Airborne
Division, which fought from Audja in
Africa through Sicily, Salerno, Italy, Nor-
mandy, Holland and the Bulge and Wesel
operations—his views are on record
in the official organ of the U.S. Command
and General Staff College;
There is a school of thought that holds
that future war will be a case of missile
versus missile until one side knocks the
other side into insensibility. Presumably
the side administering the biggest and most
effective blow will win the war is sure to
be won if you push the right button. For-
tunately this school of thought is in the
minority. Most of our civilian scientists
and military leaders are of the opinion that
missiles alone, backed by the most elaborate
bank of push-buttons, cannot win wars.
Man must close with his adversary. He
must exploit any advantage quickly and
ruthlessly. Ultimately, he must occupy
any temporary gains he may enjoy, so as
unquestionably to win the final decision.
Though guided missiles are well on the
way, they are an accessory to air and
naval war rather than a direct menace.
The defence against them is mainly in the
creation of an air-force sufficiently power-
ful and heavily-manned to stave off the
approach of attacking fleets and keep
them out of the range of accurate attack.
At sea the main conceivable conflict
within the next generation might be a
submarine war, submarines having entered
the rocket and guided-missile field.
The air, however, is the decisive field
of the future. And its most dangerous
weapon is not the atom bomb, which will
be limited in numbers through scarcity
of basic materials, and hard to spare in
a world war to attack a nation on the
distant fringes, like Australia.
With the missile most to be feared the
world is already acquainted. Carried by
aircraft ever-growing in size, speed and
range, it is the paratrooper or glider-
trooper —properly used and armed, under
modern conditions, the only deadly and
decisive “bomb” and the only one which
can consolidate its victory and capture
and control attacked territory.
There is only one antidote for him, and
that is human. It is the one which the
Chifley committee will certainly not re-
commend, because to provide it on an
effective and adequate’ scale calls for
long-term compulsory military training
for virtually the whole population of
fighting age.
The thought of this is one thing which
would send Mr. Chifley and his colleagues
helter-skelter for a hollow log, since it
would be opposed tooth and nail by
the Communist Central Committee and
its satellite union leaders and by a large
and selfish section of voters.
Without universal training, as every
military authority, and almost every
major Government except Australia’s is
agreed, there can be no effective defence.
In Australia’s case, in view of our large
area and small population, even then
only a thin protection could be pro-
vided. But the Chifley Government
would sooner run the risk of choking
itself with its tongue than advocate a
scheme which would bring into the lime-
light in all its nakedness the hideous ex-
tent to which its supporting bodies have
been red-anted by agents of our only
potential enemy worth considering.
The Government’s “defence” policy is
a huge bluff, designed to hide its own
remissness and negligence with a barrage
of noise, and to defend itself in terms of
politics —not the country.


PLAIN ENGLISH
Coal.
In Britain and Australia alike the coal
position would be comic if it were not
tragic.
As in the case of the “nationalised”
British airlines, £10,000,000 in the red in
their first year, there was *a vast loss on
the operations of the “nationalised”
British coalmines —£1,745,800 in six
months ; 3s. 3d. per ton in August. And,
apart from the sacrifices of tax-revenue,
consumers had to pay through the nose
for coal that is not only scarce all the
time but often of poor quality. Output
failed to reach the “Labor” target of
200,000,000 tons, which was 1 40,000,000
tons less than output in 1937, when the
effete Chamberlain was at the head of
affairs.
Portion of the mythical surplus
was promised to New Zealand. That
country • was encouraged to hope for
10,000 tons in January and the same
quantity in February, but has been noti-
fied that the “allocation” will be reduced
by one half. New Zealand hopes to
make up the balance by imports from
South Africa and India. Last year it
got 80,000 tons from North America, but
this year it will haVe to do without sup-
plies from that quarter unless special dol-
lar arrangements can be made.
In a'melancholy survey of the position
and outlook C. H. Benney, the Under-
secretary for Mines, said “We can land
coal at Auckland or Wellington from
Australia at less than half the cost of
similar coal brought from Britain.” But
the Communist-controlled N.S.W. coal-
miner has blasted that trade, as in
former years—then with the encourage-
ment of selfish and short-sighted mine-
owners —he blasted the export trade to
South America, China, the Malay States,
the Philippines and even U.S.A.:
For many years up to 1942 New Zealand
imported about 100,000 tons annually from
Australia; indeed, the gas-making industry
was partly built up on Australian coal.
Now Australia has hardly enough for her
own needs.
Actually Australia hasn’t nearly enough.
In a broadcast to N.S.W. coalminers
about to resume after their three
holiday K. A. Cameron, chairman of the
Joint Coal Board, said that “reserves”
were “critically” low, and that last year
there had been “continuous interruption
to industries in N. S. Wales, Victoria and
South Australia,” while other industries,
iron- and steelworks among them,
“were allotted only portion of their re-
quirements.” In addition there was “fre-
quent gas rationing in Victoria and
5.A.,” together with “restricted rail
schedules in Victoria throughout the year.”
Mr. Camerqn appealed for a weekly
production of 275,000 tons and 13,000,000
for the year, promising lashings of
“amenities.” Next day, by way of reply,
there were strikes in 15 N.S.W. pits, and
the first post-holiday week’s production
was 37,000 tons short of the target.
Full employment has arrived, at least
for a time, both in Britain and Australia,
Full, or even fairly-good, production of
coal there will never be in either country
while unwhipped Communists have the
ordering of affairs,
"Keane and Goldberg."
Through his solicitors, Mr. Joseph Gold-
berg, “very dear friend” of the late Trade
and Customs Minister Keane (“Dollars?
You or anybody else would never know
how many he had”), has taken excep-
tion to an article headed as above (B.
7/1/’4B).
To the solicitors, Messrs. J. Stuart
Thom and Co., of York-street, Sydney,
home-town of Mr. Goldberg when he
doesn’t cast up in parts abroad, such as
Washington and New York, where dol-
lars abound, “it seems obvious that the
writer of the article set out deliberately
to convey to the reader various offensive
and libellous inferences. We refer in
particular to the mention of ‘curious de-
lays’ and to the final paragraph”;
But the whole article seems to have
been written with the intention of giving
offence, and perhaps attracting some sort of
proceedings. Our client himself has had
nothing whatever to do with the delay in the
hearing of the appeal [i.e., the appeal
against his conviction on a Customs charge
of importing prohibited goods], which
has been due almost entirely to un-
availability of Mr. Shand, counsel for the
Crown, at times when the appeal could have
been heard by the Full Court.
Here The Bulletin must quote Minister
Holloway (Labor and National Service),
replying in the House on November 6,
1947, to a question asked by Mr. Harrison;
Mr. Goldberg was convicted and fined
£250 on April 11. Later, his counsel de-
cided to appeal. The appeal was set down
for hearing on June 10. Unfortunately,
on June 19 [yes, June 19] a bereavement
occurred in the family of one of Mr.
Goldberg’s counsel, and for that reason
the hearing was postponed. Then
the July law vacation intervened,
causing further delay. After that a
similar case was heard in the High Court
and, as this case had some bearing on
the Goldberg case, Mr. Goldberg’s counsel
decided to seek a further postponement
until the High Court had given its decision
[as it did o'n October 14]. That left the
way clear for the hearing of the Goldberg
case to proceed.
Then Mr. Shand, who was appearing in
the Goldberg case for the Department of
Trade and Customs, had to go to London
to appear before the Privy Council. That
caused further delay. Mr. Shand will arrive
in Australia next Wednesday [November
12], and the way will then be clear, if the
party desires to continue with the appeal,
to proceed with the hearing. In view of
the decision of the High Court in the
Wah Min Chan case, Mr. Goldberg’s coun-
sel may decide not to proceed with the
appeal.
The member for Wentworth asked who
was responsible for the long delay. It is
true to state that all the delay caused from
April 11 to October 14 was due to the
wishes of Mr. Goldberg’s counsel. Since
then, the delay has been caused by the
absence in London of Mr. Shand.
It is not on record that Mr. Goldberg
or his solicitors successfully objected to
Mr. Holloway’s explanation of “the long
delay,” which was preceded by another
“long delay.” For Mr. Goldberg was
carpeted in November, 1946 (“Joseph
Goldberg to face Customs charge”—
“S. M. Herald” Index, Nov. 21-24, 1946)
and was spared the annoyance of a hear-
ing till April, 1947, meanwhile having
gone abroad again.
Messrs. J. Stuart Thom and Co. pro-
ceed :
Your suggestion obviously is that our
client has made some sort of underhand
arrangement with some people in authority
for the purpose of avoiding discussion of
the matter or any publicity. This is cer-
tainly not the case.
To put the matter mildly, it is not usual
for reputable newspapers to write in such
a strain with reference to legal proceedings
that have not even been terminated [“not
QUACK REMEDY.
“Mr. Chifley, refusing to grant relief to overburdened taxpayers, contends that his policy
is necessary to check inflation.”
“Now stop complaining; if I didn’t bleed you like this you’d get fatty degeneration
in no time."
even been terminated” after 14 months]. Our
instructions are to require that you
publish in suitable form a retraction of any
such suggestions as those mentioned above,
failing which our client will institute pro-
ceedings.
The Bulletin admits no “suggestions,”
“suggestion” or “libellous inferences.”
It admits only that it published a political
article on a subject which, though discus-
sion has been stifled, has beqn referred to
in the House, on political grounds, again
and again, and which, since it affects the
administration and credit of the public
man who was Minister of Trade and
Customs from October 7, 1941, to July
13, 1945, is a matter of great public in-
terest and concern. It is certainly not
going to withdraw political statements
and comments unless they are proved
false. If Mr. Goldberg can prove them
false, and this of course will necessitate
his vouchsafing a full and particular ac-
count, in the first person, of his relations
with Mr. Keane, he may rely on getting
a generous allotment of space and all
the satisfaction he can legitimately claim.
Dmitrov and Disciples.
From “Tovarisch Needlenose”:
In the Bulgarian “Parliament” the Communist
Premier Dmitrov threatened nine socialist
members with the fate of Petkov if they voted
against his Budget as “insincere and unreal.”
Petkov was the Bulgarian patriot who fought
for the Allies when Bulgaria was a Nazi puppet
State and Dmitrov a Nazi agent. Dmitrov had
him hanged, after a travesty of a trial, to the
disgust and horror of civilised people every-
where.
The bloodthirsty ruffian had another refer-
ence to his victim in a criminally insolent vein;
If Washington and London had not in-
tervened [i.e., appealed for mercy, since
justice had been denied] Petkov’s head
could have been saved. But when it came
to blackmailing the Bulgarian nation and
infringing the right of our sovereign
people’s court the death sentence had to be
carried out, and it was carried out.
Which exhibits a tigerish ferocity that must
chill the blood of anyone who has blood to
chill.
Dmitrov first came into the limelight 24
years ago, when he fled his country after
having been involved in a revolutionary murder
plot. He was associated a year or two later
with the bombing of Sofia cathedral, when
123 men, women and children were blown
to bits and had to be buried in a common grave.
To writing boys and other sentimental
simpletons throughout the world Dmitrov
achieved fame at the Reichstag-fire trial, “con-
founding Goring with his eloquence.” Had
he been as eloquent as Deakin the Nazis
would have disposed of him with rope or
axe had they chosen to believe him guilty, or
if his death would have been of advantage to
them. They seem to have spared the scoundrel
because he acted as a decoy for the unfortunate
half-wits who were killed off for the “crime,”
and because he would be useful to them in
days to come.
This suspicion received color from the fact
that after his “trial” Dmitrov was allowed to
stay in Germany during the period when Stalin
and Hitler were organising their plans for the
division of Poland and at the same time black-
guarding one another to deceive the world.
Dmitrov became general secretary to the
Comintern. As such he issued orders to the
Australian Communist party, which published
his edicts as if they were holy gospels. For
example, the pamphlet “War and the Work-
ing Class,” which must have been in cold-
storage when war broke out in 1939.
In this Dmitrov declared that Britain and
France, as “imperialists,” were the “instigators
and provokers” of the war. He urged workers
in Australia and elsewhere to take “militant
action” to bring about peace with Hitler, since,
with Poland divided between Germany and the
U.S.S.R., there was nothing left to fight for ;
and in this spirit “militant” war-time strikes
were organised in Australia. Dmitrov re-
mained general secretary of the Comintern (on
which the Australian C.P. had an executive
member, Sharkey) when it moved its H.Q.
to Vienna in 1940, and operated from there
with the Nazis’ help and protection.
In a foreword ? to a thick pamphlet issued
by the Australian Communist Party Central
Executive in January, 1945, Sharkey, the presi-
dent of the Australian Communist party, wrote:
Dmitrov’s speech [i.e., at the 1935
Comintern Conference, contained in the
pamphlet] ranks as a classic exposition of
what unity of the Labor movement is and
what it means. It is still a reliable guide
for all united-front activity and indicates
the line of march of socialism.
When the Communist party went under-
ground after being banned in 1940 as a sub-
versive organisation, it called its illegal press
the Dmitrov Press.
It is now suspected even at Canberra that
Dmitrov’s disciples in this country are about
to institute a section of the new Cominform
—Dmitrov and other bloodstained Balkan thugs
are committee members.
If this comes to pass alien-born Communists
should be seized and sent to join Dmitrov or
Rakosi, the Hungarian who signed the actual
document creating the Australian Communist
party as a section of Moscow’s fifth-column.
The Unguarded North.
“Oliver Filter”: The bush-telegraph
has been running hot with stories of
landings in N.T. and the Westralian
Kimberleys by unidentified aircraft. It
has been surmised that at least one was
engaged in smuggling gold, for which
there is a fancy market in Singapore, as
was stated in the proceedings against the
Polish Jew oddly naturalised in war-time,
and now in Westralia facing a conspiracy
charge.
Prohibited immigrants, rocket-range
spies and guns for “our Indernesian com-
rades” have also been suggested as
possible cargoes. Nor is any of these
things impossible, now or in the future.
From Exmouth Gulf (W.A.) to Cape
York there is any number of airstrips
and claypans where aircraft could land,
and they could pick up ex-R.A.A.F.
petrol still lying around in those parts.
In any. case, with short island hops and
light loadings, aircraft could carry suffi-
cient fuel to get them into Australia, and
out again.
It all makes out a case for the estab-
lishment of an aerial coastguard service
in the north, operated and maintained by
the R.A.A.F. or in co-operation with it.
A score of Australian-made “lightweight
air-warning” radar stations, which did a
sterling job during the war, could, even
though reckoned obsolete by comparison
with modern equipment, cover the coast
from the North-west Cape to Cape York
with a few hundred men. A handful of
Mosquitoes (made in Australia) and a few
of the Catalinas which the Government
disposed of after the war, too quickly and
too cheap, could, with bases at Exmouth
Gulf, Port Hedland, Broome, Truscott,
Darwin, Gove or Melville Bay, and in the
Gulf at, say, Karumbaand at Cape York,
provide a most effective patrol.
Such a patrol would have more than
its obvious use. It would be an invalu-
able adjunct to the N.T. police, the flying-
doctor services and Civil Aviation; it
would improve and widen the R.A.A.F.’s
field of training; and it would be a basis
for the defence network that would have
to be thrown around the North in the
event of another war.
Prices Referendum Ramp.
Canberra Ministers argue that if the
Prices Referendum appeal should be re-
fused chaos would ensue because “the
States cannot do the job.” It was most
effectually shown during the debate on
the bill, by Mr. Lang as well as by Liberal
opponents:
(1) That land-sales control (e.g.) is not
necessary as a corollary to the control of
rents, has never been applied or so re-
garded under rent controls in S. Africa
and Canada, and is in fact operated in
Australia on no common base of values.
(2) That idiotic Australian restrictions
have created and are extending general
blackmarket dealing in these matters.
(3) That as regards rents S.A. and W.A.
have all through exercised their own con-
trols, refusing to recognise Canberra’s “peg
dates.” In other States the “peg dates”
differ from each other, and in fact all such
controls have operated not on a central
but on a State unit, system.
(4) That the plea that the States cannot
and will not control rents is sheer bunkum.
The truth is rather that the Commonwealth
all through has put up merely a pretence
of a centralised system. It could not do
otherwise with building and repair costs
different in every State.
Mr. Lang detailed a list of varying Minis-
terial excuses for retaining these price-
control powers and now seeking them
permanently.
One Minister says they are needed to
deal with a depression just round the corner.
Another says they are to regulate the pros-
perity already with us. Another, that the
Government must have them to cope with
inflation; another, that we must get ready
for deflation; another, that it is because
prices of primary produce are going sky-
high ; yet another that we must prepare for
a collapse of agricultural prices.
The truth is, as the Big Fellow pointed
out, that these powers have no connec-
tion whatever with the real economic
needs of the country.
Out-Menacing the Rabbit.
Adelaide “Advertiser’s” Canberra re-
porter has availed himself of the Parlia-
mentary recess to dig out information
about Government employees, whom
he describes as “increasing even more
rapidly than the rabbit” and threatening
to “become nearly as damaging.”
When the second German war broke
out there were 418,000 Government and
“semi-Government” employees, part-
timers included. At the end of 1947 the
correspondent reckoned the total at
575,000, and found the horde “increasing
at the rate of at least 10,000 a year”:
Some of the figures of Federal depart-
mental expansion are extremely interesting.
The urge of most departmental heads to
build up the prestige of their departments
—always strong —is being allowed to operate
unchecked. But the output per man per
day in 1947 was a very great deal lower
than it was, over the service as a whole,
in, 1939.
Set against a population increase of about
10 p.c. four sample increases in
Commonwealth public servants alone:
Post-Office, 60 p.c.; Health, 138 p.c, ;
Commerce, 164 p.c.; Commonwealth
Bank, 77 p.c. And with a mere 10 per
cent, the population is expected to find
just on £414,000,000 in taxes and charges.
Income-tax alone accounts for
£208,296,000 of it; the general increase
has advanced thus: —
To June 30, 1943, £283,554,000; 1944,
£325,066,000; 1945, £360,106,000; 1946,
£378^205,000; 1947, £413,968,000.
And what is the nation getting in return?
Unwanted socialist legislation, a growing
interference with individual freedom, re-
strictions on every kind of initiative and
enterprise, immense losses on Government
“undertakings” and a general drift to-
wards “Labor” and Communist serfdom.

POLITICAL POINTS
Never again will Chifley have his own
way with the Premiers-in-conference and
the Loan Council. Until the ides of
March last year he commanded six votes
to one. Now he will have four to three at
best, and on uniform income taxation,
which has become an issue through his
own clumsy mishandling, it will be one
to six. Hanlon and McGirr are bearing
down on him with the equivalent of
“union demands” and with memories of
how the “stubborn” P.M. squibbed on
wage-pegging. And Hollway will be there
with a powerful case for Victoria, and
with the prestige which has accrued to
him from a stout fight in a good cause
which Chifley abandoned, though his
own “streamlined arbitration” was in-
volved.
What a tawdry imitation of a Com-
munist police State “Labor” Australia is
becoming! Witness the order issued to
the Australian girls working for the
Americans in Japan, Guam and the Philip-
pines, to come home immediately and
spend their converted dollars in Australia.
Witness also the report that “Australia”
supported Russia in dishing a U.N.O.
discussion on the case of the hundreds
of Russian women married to Britons and
Americans and savagely refused their
right to rejoin their husbands. “Aus-
tralia’s vote helped to defeat the British
proposal.” This choice item came over
the air via the A.B.C. news service
(“Labor’s” own), so it must be right.
When the Yugo. ship Partizanka, tied
up in Sydney at the week-end, was ap-
proaching Fremantle that port and Perth
became conscious of “persistent rumors”
(“West Australian”) that the dirty-look-
ing craft was carrying “a large number
of Communists.” “Authorities” admitted
two: “an officer of the Victorian branch
of the Communist party” and “the presi-
dent of the W.A. section of Eureka
Youth.” For the rest, “authorities”
pleaded that “the Government’s policy
allowed complete freedom of political
thought”—which may be interpreted to
mean that it has no objections to import-
ing Communists galore —and that “action
would be taken only .against persons who
engaged in subversive activities.” When
did “Labor” ever “take action against
persons who engaged in subversive ac-
tivities”? Why, the mob at Canberra
found a C.S.I.R. job for a Communist
who served a sentence for engaging in
“subversive activities” and was recom-
mended (though not in “Labor’s” time)
for internment till the end of the war —
in his case, four years.
Gandhi’s latest fast, though not his
longest, was much more effective than the
Security Council intervention in the India-
Pakistan business is likely to be. At any
rate it brought about a Nehru promise of
protection for Moslems and Sikhs in
Delhi, of a plebiscite in Junagarh and of
the transfer to the Pakistan Government
of cash balances due to it under the
partition arrangement and “withheld.”
Why doesn’t Chifley try a Gandhi fast?
It would be an agreeable change from
whining that he “won’t crucify the
workers” {i.e., won’t interfere with Com-
munist and other' union larrikins when
they hold communities to ransom and
stamp violently on his own industrial
laws), or sit back sneering when men like
Hollway and Oldham, McDonald and
Dunstan, recall public employees to their
public duty and invoke the rule of law.
And his Health Department doctors
could be trusted to intervene if, like
Gandhi, he “began to feel heavy in the
head,” or thicker in that region than
normally.
Melbourne’s citizenry went to bed on
Thursday night with a train strike as well
as a tram strike pending, Newport power-
house employees having decided to come
out in “sympathy.” The train strike was
on at midnight and off again fopr hours
later. Meanwhile Hollway was pushing
his Emergency Bill through, and a 90-
minutes’ conference between Tramway
Board chairman Bell, the Federal secre-
tary of the union (not the Communist
O’Shea) and Conciliation Commissioner
Blackburn, V.C., resulted in the
last-named making an order, for the
board to apply the principles of
the five-day week as soon as it
could bring out the new rosters. When
the citizens woke up on Friday morning
the tram-tracks were being greased and
the trains were running. The Emergency
Act remains for future use against the
O’Sheas and Browns should they remain,
though a suitable coalhole might be found
for them on the Partizanka.
A Victorian Railwaymen’s Union ulti-
matum, issued by “the executive,” with
the Communist Brown as Big Boss:
We reaffirm our full support of the de-
mands of the tramwaymen. We demand
that the Government immediately end this
conspiracy and grant the tramwaymen’s
just demands.
Twenty-six words and three of them
“demands,” “demand” and “demands.”
For lying insolence only Communists
themselves could match the thing.
Expressing the fear that “the Com-
monwealth Government’s obligation to
construct a railway from Alice Springs
to Darwin” is about to be repudiated
once more, .this time by Ward, Playford
recalled that “this work was reluctantly
included in the plan to standardise and
modernise Australian railways,” after his
Government had objected to the Ward-
Clapp Queensland substitute:
It was obvious that some Federal
Ministers were unfamiliar with the un-
fulfilled agreement under which the Com-
monwealth obtained the Northern Terri-
tory.
Yet before and after the Northern
Territory Acceptance Act came into
force on January 1, 1911, the Official
Year-Book had a standing line apropos
of the “obligation”:
The Commonwealth agrees to com-
plete the construction of the transconti-
nental railway from Port Darwin to Port
Augusta.
Don’t these Federal Ministers ever read
their own Year-Book, or anything except
newspapers and racebooks?
The Canberra invasion of Melbourne
was alleged to be a war-time necessity,
and post-war evacuation was promised—
falsely. In the last 18 months the Federal
“ ‘Labor’ Government” has taken over
the Oddfellows’ huge building in Swan-
ston-street, as' well as Reliance House,
Chancery House, Henty House and other
places, and packed them with civil ser-
vants ; and now it is going to spend three-
quarters of a million in “acquiring” nine
and a half acres in the only part of the
congested city where commercial expan-
sion is possible. The area, already built
on, is bounded by Latrobe, Spring, Exhi-
bition and Lonsdale streets and includes
“Little Lon.” The City Council tried to
eliminate that ulcer 20 years ago, but with
slight success. It is in future to be buried
under a pile of masonry 132 feet high
and inhabited by approximately 10,000
civil servants. Cost? Three millions is
the estimate, but in these matters “Labor”
estimates are always at least doubled,
and sometimes trebled,
Canberra’s city land-grab of 9\ acres
of Melbourne is relished only by Can-
berra and its army of Government em-
ployees. One objection is that Canberra
is using its resumption powers to get the
land at much below its fair market value.
And the City Council morosely points out
that Crown property is rate-free. With a
building limit of 132 ft. there will be over
100 acres of floorspace in the 9\ acres
for trundling tea to the civil servants. If
superfluous Federal departments were
eliminated there would be no need for
the acquisition, but that would run
counter to the natural biological law that
bureaucracies, like the dinosaurus, always
grow fatter until they blow up.
During the war Canada made gifts of
$1,000,000,000 to Britain and $18,301,000
(in wheat) to Greece, and
$2,471,761,000 in mutual aid, Australia
being among the beneficiaries. Since the
war Canada has lent Britain
$1,250,000,000 at a nominal rate of in-
terest and granted $594,500,000 in credits
to other countries, among them the
U.S.S.R.—it expressed its “gratitude”
in the spy plot. All this deserves to be
written in a Golden Book.
The generous Canadian Government,
explaining the continuance of its war-
time grants-in-aid policy:
It is very much to our interest that other
countries should be able to buy, not only
as a means of getting our production and
trade re-established immediately, but also
in order to assist these good customers and
friendly countries to re-establish their own
economic life on a satisfactory basis.
Australian “Labor’s” answer was to im-
provise measures striking at the Canadian
export trade and depriving the Australian
press and publishing houses of newsprint.
And all this without consulting Canada,
which might have suggested an alternative
—its office in Australia and the U.S. office
have already suggested many ways in
which Australia could earn dollars. One
result of “Labor’s” exclusive attitude is
that hundreds of newspaper employees
have been put off in Sydney alone. Nearly
all “Labor” supporters, too.
Chifley, it seems, is taxing us up to the
eyes for our own good ; “to prevent in-
flation,” which is not being prevented.
Truman is for immediate “tax-relief on
low incomes” provided company taxation
is increased, meanwhile continuing to
“scale-down the public debt” as a pre-
liminary to all-round tax-relief. For re-
duction of debt, he says, the “Government
should use all surplus income,” at
the same time “achieving maximum
economy”—both anti-inflation measures.
Is Chifley trying to “achieve maxi-
mum economy” and “scale-down the
public debt”? No ; he is continuing to
add to the already excessive number of
Government employees (trebled in his
own domain since 1939) and planning to
add scores of thousands more ; and, so
far from “scaling-down the public debt,”
he is borrowing again.
Although “Follow British ‘Labor’!” is
now the “policy” at Canberra, Beasley
denounced “British ‘Labor’s’ ” deal with
Egypt, which has been worrying it for a
reduction of its huge sterling balance:
According to the “People,” the Dominions
are angry with the Mother Country. On
their behalf Mr. Beasley has been kicking
up a high old row. Bluntly, he declared to
Sir Stafford Cripps that the Dominions
had been given a dirty deal as they were
hot told that Egypt was to get 25,000,000
dollars from the Empire pool until the
deed was done.
“On their behalf” is a characteristic touch.
Whether or not the non-“ Labor” Gov-
ernments of Canada and South Africa
ever heard of Beasley, they do not com-
mission him to voice whatever objections
they may have to British “Labor” pro-
ceedings. Certainly they were not parties
to the Beasley-Evatt cry, raised in 1945,
that Lord Addison or some other mild
ancient was trying to elbow Austrylier out
of the Jap-surrender ceremony.
From the good-as-“ Labor” “Daily
Mirror,” Sydney:-
A 1947 Buick sedan, owned by Mr. J.
Arthur, M.L.A., was stolen from Edge-
cliff-road, Double Bay. It was found by
the Eastern Wireless Patrol in King-street,
Randwick.
Arthur (“Joshua George; club,
R.A.C.A.”) is “Labor.” “Labor” and
friends are remarkably successful, the
common herd remarkably unsuccessful,
in getting 1947 Buicks and the like.
Out of the aggregate of £1,482,168
lost by the Victorian Government
railways in the last financial year,
£1,150,000 went west because of industrial
stoppages in October, 1946, and in March-
May, 1947.
“S. M. Herald” hails as “a triumph
for Security Council intervention” an
agreement signed by the Dutch and “our
Indernesian comrades” aboard a United
States transport in Batavia Harbor. It
is, in fact, a triumph for the Dutch, who
have gained everything they contended
for when, as the “Herald” puts it, “they
drove the Indonesians back and extended
their control to two-thirds of Java.”
Russia, supported by “Australia”—“Aus-
tralia,” in pursuance of the “‘Labor’
policy” of abject surrender to the Com-
munists of the waterfront unions and the
Brisbane Labor Council—strove in vain
for a Security Council order to the Dutch
to withdraw behind their original lines.
In the words of the “Times” the Republi-
can “Government” has had to abandon
“claims to rule over sub-races in Java
and Sumatra,” and “neutral observers be-
lieve it is unlikely to last longer than
six months.”
The N.Z. Racing Commission set up
by “Labor” (always somewhat different
over there) has reported against licensing
of bookmakers, lotteries and the tin-hare
and in favor of off-the-course tote-shops
—which seems a blot on an otherwise
worthy State paper, as the tote-shop
would be a blot on the landscape. But
it has moved Baddeley to a beatific
vision of tote-shops shooting up in N. S.
Wales and diverting punting money into
“proper channels.” Good old Baddeley,
man-mountain of complacent and imper-
turbable fatuousness.
One of the New Year messages, un-
accountably overlooked by the Sydney
flapper press, was issued from “the flat
Sinecure” at Surfers’ Paradise, Queens-
land, . by “John Woolcott Forbes,”
formerly Louis Brandi. Brassy in two
senses of the term, “Forbes” allowed
that Queensland had “a great future,”
and descried in Surfers’ Paradise “the
Florida of Australia”:
It cost 200 million dollars to make
Florida what it is today. “Surfers’ ” could
be completely transformed for a lot less.
It could, seeing that it is only a small,
though exceptionally nice, place, whereas
Florida is twice the size of Tasmania.
But anyone with thoughts of hiring the
tenant of “the flat Sinecure” to “trans-
form” it for “a lot less” than 200 million
dollars should be warned that there are
objections. One is that the fellow is an
undischarged bankrupt.
A struggle for domination of Yugo-
slavs in Australia has been going on ever
since; the outbreak of the German war.
Among the anti-Communists are families
from which good Diggers came, but the
Tito faction has so far prevailed that an
exodus of Yugos to Titoland is beginning.
The number has been variously estimated
at 500 to 5000. In N.Z. the tide seems to
be running against the Communists, as
witness the report that a kid of 17 was to
be appointed “Yugoslav Consular agent
in the Dominion.” The opposition
threatened to protest to Governor-
General Freyberg, V.C., and to the
Yugoslav Embassy in London; and the
kid didn’t get the job.
From “Hobson’s Choice”:
The way in which the Commo-run unions
general-strike apparatus ran down with a hor-
rible crash in Melbourne on Thursday night
was a subject for general comic relief.
Throughout the day one Commo-bossed
union after another had issued its strike pro-
nunciamento. The seamen came m (or,
rather, out) at 11.30 a.m.; 3.15 p.m. saw a
march of trammies (500) to Parliament House,
to “cheer the police”; at 4.30 the wharfies
slung in their hooks, and the exultant voice
of Commo Brown was heard to the effect that
Newport powerhouse would stop at midmgnt.
But midnight found the Trades Hall burning
oil at the witching hour, there being no power.
And at 2 a.m. “the A.R.U., the F.E.D.F.A.,
the A.E.U. and the Ironworkers jointly issued
a request to members of their unions
to report for normal duty as quickly as pos-
sible.”
Before the boys went to bed the Com-
munist Thomson (Building Trades) boasted that
“We got more out of the Government than
most of the Trades Hall Council expected
Even with a six months’ strike, probably the
movement would not have got much more.

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLE'S INKS"
“Pookie”: Scene: one of those de-
lightful leafy walks one comes across un-
expectedly in Sydney with, not far away,
the calm harbor shimmering under a per-
fect moon. A few paces ahead of me a
man and girl were walking, loitering,
arms linked and heads close together.
Delicacy inclined me to leave them be,
but it was late, I was tired and it was
necessary to pass them. Passing, I heard
a low masculine murmur: “My kidneys
are playing up again.”

“Fons”: Newspaper reports of the
successful tour of Great Britain and
France by the Australian Rugby Union
team have been strong in details of in-
jured shoulders and ankles, but lacking
in those rich and entertaining stories
which make up the character of a tour.
There has been nothing, for instance, to
compare with Waratah forward Bluey
Judd’s famous retort to a spectator’s com-
plaint “That’s not cricket” —after Bluey
had thrown a footballer at the spectator,
who had been annoying him. The in-
cident took place in Wales, where they
take their football intensely. Another
Welsh story concerns a Waratah victory,
after which a crowd escorted the players
to the train. It was a very quiet, glum
crowd; no word was spoken, no band
played. In awful silence the Australians
climbed into the train. Then Judd poked
his head out a window and shouted,
“The best side lost. Three cheers for the
losers.” The train, it is alleged, didn’t
leave for three hours.

“Youanmi”; It’s fairly common
opinion that the housing shortage is do-
ing fearful things to the marriage- and
birth-rates, .and I used to agree until I
heard two women baring their hearts to
each other in the “lounge” of a King’s
Cross hotel. “If only we could find a
flat somewhere, we’d be married to-
morrow,” said one. The other, a case-
hardened blonde, came back with “If only
I could find one, I’d leave my husband
today.”

“Jonah”: Those camp cinemas in the
Middle East (B. 7/1 / ’4B) gave us a lot
of entertainment, not because® of the
films they showed but because of the
way they showed them. The operators
seqmed neither to know nor care how to
run a film through the projectors. I
remember the night they showed “The
Daltons Ride Again,” at Shafto’s cinema
at Tel-el-Kebir. The first reel came on
without any previous titling, so we
watched with amazement a herd of
cowboys galloping to and fro across the
screen and shooting each other to death.
Then a blinding flash, and the title
came flickering on, followed by all
the dead cowboys, now very much alive,
and their horses happily kicking their
heels across the countryside. By then
the Gyppo or Greek inside the projection-
hut seemed to have tumbled that some-
thing was wrong, so he whipped that reel
off and substituted one which gave us a
quick and precarious glimpse of the
heroine welcoming the hero back after
a long and presumably hazardous journey.
So it went on. In despair, the
operator then gave us the shooting reel
again, turned up the lights, put on the
record of King Farouk’s National
Anthem and hared it hot-footed across
the desert before the blokes realised he'd
gone.
“No Sirrah”: Shafto’s camp picture-
shows? One night the Diggers expressed
their opinion of the show by making a
heap of the benches in the middle of
the cinema and then setting fire to them.
They stormed out of the entrance, found
that the manager was visiting the cinema
and turned his car upside-down. A rapid
recce revealed the cashier galloping over
the horizon with the cash-box tucked
underneath his arm. He knew his cus-
tomers —and his projectionist. It was
rumored that Shafto was an Australian
who had visited Egypt during the
1914-18 war and had settled down
there afterwards. True or not, he cer-
tainly made a pile out of his camp
cinemas, in spite of “The Bulletin ad-
missions” and the like.
“Bybren”: With bottled beer scarce
the old chap with a sugar-bag displaying
the unmistakable bulge of seven or eight
bottles was eyed with envy by the mob
in the bar. Finishing his drink he made
to swing the load on to his back. It
slipped and fell to the cement floor, liquor
seeping from the bottom of the bag. The
“Ah’s different, boss; da lion puts his head in MAH mouth."
old bloke eyed the widening pool with
dismay ; the crowd gathered round with
a solemnity befitting the occasion and
watched in silence as the old boy untied
the bag and peered into the depths. He
withdrew the shattered remains of a
lemonade-bottle. Beneath it, all intact,
were six bottles of beer. A toothy grin
lit the old chap’s face. I put him down
as an old soldier or ex-civil-servant when
he announced “This is one time, gents,
when the kick was passed from the
bottom to the top.”
* * * *
“Camsa”: The Tantanoola tiger was
captured again, on New Year’s Eve. Un-
armed, the revellers had little trouble sur-
rounding the large wooden “tiger” on
the roof of the Tantanoola Hotel in S.A.
The “tiger” was captured unhurt, though
several of the hunters appeared to be
casualties.
* * * *
“Lower Tops’l”: Kerguelen Island,
where the L.S.T. 3501 established a fuel-
dump for the Wyatt Earp, is more than a
lump of dirt sticking out of the Southern
Ocean. The snowcapped mountain peaks
of the 75-mile-long island stand across the
path of the roaring westerly gales and
violent snowstorms, and these gales im-
part to the place its character and its
limits. Composed of lakes, bogs and ter-
raced hills, the main feature of the tree-
less, desolate land—it was named in 1772
by Kerguelen, though Cook was there
four years later —is its numerous fiords.
Royal Sound, where the L.S.T. tied up, is
a magnificent sheet of water, nine times
the size of. Sydney Harbor, and at Port
Jeanne d’Arc there are a substantial wharf
and a cluster of dwellings, sheds and
tanks which, until the advent of factory-
ships, was an important shore whaling
station. Bossierie, the lessee 40 years ago,
ran sheep and introduced rabbits to the
island, but more than a century ago
Kerguelen was well known to ship-
masters. By 1800 more than 1,000,000 fur
seals had been captured on its shores.
and in 1843 it was estimated 500 whaling
and sealing vessels were working its
harbors. As late as 1897 the brigantine
Edward, of Melbourne, went there and
returned with 51 tons of sea-elephant oil.

“Waddlin’ Willie”: When sailors of the
British Fleet visited the Melbourne Zoo
last winter they threw silver coins to
Tang, the orang-utan comedian. The more
they threw the more antics he would per-
form. Last week . when a keeper was
cleaning out the cage he found shillings
and sixpences neatly stacked in a corner
and all bearing Tang’s toothmarks. They
checked up; he was sixpence short of a
quid.

“Bybren”: Adelaide City Council’s blitz
on the pigeon-life of the Town Hall has
not made any appreciable difference, but
the invasion of millions of grasshoppers
offers another possibility of depleting
their numbers. Given a diet of hoppers
for a week or two, even the strongest
gastric juices should break down. This has
already happened to some of the birds at
the zoo, one having died and a few others
looking as if they could easily follow suit.
Only difficulty seems to be getting the
pigeons to do their part. Unlike the
starlings and sparrows, who are making
the best of a good thing while it lasts,
the pigeons are only half-hearted about
this sudden glut. There’s a faint hope,
though, that the hoppers may devour the
pigeons.
* * * *
“Pring”: “Hamfat” (B. 7/1/’4B) refers
to a “full-blooded American Indian who
came to Australia with Captain Slocum
in the war-canoe Titikum.” As a matter
of historical accuracy, Captain Joshua
Slocum’s round-the-world vessel was the
yacht Spray, and the Indian dugout war-
canoe that circumnavigated the globe was
named Tilikum, and was in charge of
Captain Voss. The late Captain David
Jones, of Newcastle (N.S.W.), told me
that during his service as pilot at one of
the outstations on the N.S.W. coast he
one day saw a small vessel sailing north,
within hailing-distance of the port. In
reply to his inquiry “What ship are you?”
he received the answer “Spray, Captain
Slocum, Bawston to Bawston.” Voss's
voyage took place in the early 1900’s —
I believe the Tilikum was on exhibition
in Melbourne for a small admission fee.
I saw it when it arrived in Table Bay
(Cape Town) about 1904-05.

“Bo”: Richard Tauber, whose death
has robbed the .world of its greatest ex-
ponent of Mozart opera (always the
most difficult to do really well) and of
lieder, and whose Australian tour was
to have been A.B.C.’s choicest 1948 offer-
ing, was one of the very few foreign-
born singers completely to master
the English language in song. It
is hard for even the dignified concert-
goer to suppress a grin when the Italian
tenor sings passionately of his “yove”
for his inamorata —the initial “1” is the
great bugbear of Latin and Teuton trying
to sing in English. But Tauber’s diction,
even when singing at Sullivanesque tempo
such a song as “Pedro the Fisherman,”
was an object-lesson for many singers
whose native tongue is English. Tauber
had the uncanny ability to invest the
lighter songs, such as A. P. Herbert’s
wittily-worded “Girls Were Made to Love
and Kiss,” with high artistry. He was
probably the only singer in the world
whose control of the half-voice in the
stratospheric register could trick his
audience into the belief that it was a
falsetto note. But above all his voice
had not only an instantly recognisable
quality as distinct from products of the
bel canto school, but the rare power to
bring goosefiesh or a spine-tingle to his
hearers as he took a high C on full throat.

“Melbn”: The miracle of the slab of
masonry which fell from the top of the
Flinders-street station at a peak hour
without hitting anyone occurs more often
than citizens imagine. Things fall from
city buildings pretty often, yet seldom is
anybody hurt. I was walking along
Bourke-street, decided to cross, changed
my mind and continued onwards when,
with a terrific clatter, a shower of planks
fell from the fourth storey of a haber-
dashery right on the spot which I would
have reached had I continued with my first
intention. Although it was the height of
the afternoon-shopping frenzy nobody
was injured. A friend once told me that
the waters of Port Phillip are much more
dangerous than the streets of the city.
“Why?” I asked him. “Well,” he said,
“I’va been walking Melbourne’s pave-
ments for forty years and none of Mel-
bourne’s myriad pigeons has ever scored
a bull’s-eye on me, but the only time I
ever went out in a boat a shag did.”
•P
“Emmie”: “Macnell” (B. 7/1/’4B)
must be thinking of the 268 Radar, which
the last two International Meetings on
Radio Aids to Navigation pronounced
obsolete, and which must be replaced as
soon as industry can produce enough
equipment. Recently I attended trials at
Canvey Island (U.K.), where Admiralty
Signals Establishment tested some equip-
ment which is off the secret list and which
is being produced by a leading electronics
establishment in Middlesex. This equip-
ment clearly shows rain-clouds or
cumulus storm-clouds and the echo is not
deflected in any way by water or wave-
formations. A rock ahead of a ship
will show as nothing more than a rock,
and both the height and width can be
easily measured. The brightness of the
image gives some idea of the thickness of
the rock. Range of the new equipment
is from 50 yards to 100 miles, although
the really effective maximum range is
about 50-60 miles. So far snowfall has
had little or no effect on the clarity of
the echo and image. The old 268 has
done a wonderful job, but this new gear
is out on its own. What’s more, it’s 100
per cent. British.

“X.S.”: The most disappointed man
in Melbourne is a homeseeker who dis-
covered a house in Elwood, boarded-up
and empty and therefore fair quarry for
the houseless fellow if he could obtain
the necessary legal order. Ferreting out
the present address of the owner, he went
to the Court for an order of occupancy,
which he got in a few minutes. He was
on his way to serve the notice on that
anti-social individual when it occurred to
him to have another look at the dwelling.
Observation through various peepholes
revealed that everything was in perfect
order. Only the floor was missing.

“Bar Din”: Grog as a morale-booster
(B. 14/1/’48)? We were backed to the
wind and shivering like a handful of
weak and dispirited old ewes at an icy
hole near the Monastir Gap, Northern
Greece. This despite wearing all avail-
able Army kit, besides blankets folded
under greatcoats as a sort of jacket. But
the wind blew through us. Then we
were gfVen a generous issue of O.P. rum.
Fire crept down our toes and fingers, and
in a twinkling our staid and stern
sergeant had thrown his head back, given
a whoop and led a war-dance round the
gun. Round and round we ran, leaping,
howling and cavorting. It scared the life
out of the Don R. the O.C. sent up to
investigate from B.H.Q. half a mile
away. And after the fire died in us and
we discovered that Jerry patrols were
just round the bend it scared us.

“Zake”; Those Sydney denizens whose
favorite sport is bending between two
oars and trying to get a heavy motor-
boat back to the boatshed against a
strong headwind ought to be happy at
one bayside resort. The technique
is simple but effective. The- boat-
shed owner starts the engine off on
petrol and when it is running nice and
hot he fills the tank with kerosene. The
mug comes along, and with a flourish the
boatshed prop, flicks the flywheel-strap
and she ticks over rhythmically. He
stops it and invites the mug to try.
First go ; why, it’s easy! Away you go,
son. Thirty bob for the day. Lunch-
time comes; way down the river, bay
or creek the engine’s cut off and the
picnickers dally for an hour or two.
The engine gets cold. The mug whirls the
strap, and for the next half-hour keeps
on cursefully whirling, but the engine is
unresponsive, for it won’t start on kero.
So the oars are pulled out and the hard
work commences, for the mug has to get
his deposit back. Everyone’s unhappy but
the boatshed prop., who has saved quite
a bit of petrol and a lot of wear and
tear on his engine.
MINERALOGY.
“Federal Cabinet has decided to offer substantial
rewards for the discovery of deposits of uranium,
thorium, plutonium or any other mineral that can
be used in the production of atomic energy.”
You grizzled old prospectors
And company directors
Who hold no time is wasted
On any mineral that’s
Of marketable value,
I hardly need to tell you
Here’s something to be pasted
In your collective hats.
Earth keeps, besides her treasures
Of carboniferous measures
And stores of yellow metal
For which our miners toil,
Something that experts hold is
Of more account than gold is
And which may even settle
The prior claims of oil.
“Gold’s in them hills,” I’m laying
You’ve oft caught someone saying,
And found such speculating
So hackneyed that it irks; ,
But none I’ve ever heard of
Ever lets slip a word of
Where thorium is waiting
Or where plutonium lurks.
What, shouts will fill the pages
Of “Arguses” and “Ages,”
What scientific cranium
Won’t feel a thrill of pride
When the glad news is bruited
Around us, undisputed,
That picks have struck uranium
On some far countryside!
It carries the essentials
Of yet unknown potentials,
And much on its assistance,
We know, may yet depend
For various inventions
Devised with the intentions
Of brightening existence —•
Or hastening its end.

“Pasquin”: A Melbourne weekly has
given a vivid account of the perilous
fight against weather and sea in landing
stores on Heard Island from our Antarctic-
expedition vessel. Dominating the text
was a photograph of a square, pugnacious
face. A portrait of the expedition’s
leader? No—a snap of Dr, Evatt, who
“released” the story from his igloo in the
icy wastes of Canberra.

“Victor”: Kawana Hotel is the best of
the leave hostels available for 8.C.0.F.
personnel. Built in the Western manner in
1936, it is 20 miles south of Atami, on
the western coast of Izu Peninsula, about
90 miles south-west of Tokyo. The
rooms are luxurious, most with bathroom
attached. The hotel on an eminence over-
looks its two golf-courses, one not at
present used, the other, to the left of the
hotel, in first-class order. Beyond is the
ocean. Further to the left the panorama
includes the top of Fujiyama. Many of
the pre-war hotel staff are still employed ;
and a head-waiter ushering one to a
suitable seat in the dining-room with
the traditional Japanese bow is an ex-
perience. Such occasions are not
possible normally because all hotels are
out of bounds to 8.C.0.F, troops. The
hotel interior decorations include the
German eagle motif, and copies of a
German magazine entitled “Berlin, Rome,
Tokyo” are still available in the library.
These are reminders of the fact that dur-
ing the war German diplomatic and
service representatives were housed in
Kawana. It is symbolic to turn from a
German eagle overlooking the main
lounge to the British Commonwealth
flags fluttering in front of the hotel, over-
looking that part of the Pacific Ocean
which once for a torturing period was a
“Japanese Lake.”

“Lao-dah”: The democratising of the
monarchy is producing the same results
in Japan as it has elsewhere. Any trivi-
ality is worth reporting, and there is
a touch of unconscious humor in a recent
Japanese example, recording how Hiro-
hito can not only take a fan between his
toes and fan himself, but is able to do
this remarkable feat while swimming and,
moreover, he can swim in the rain hold-
ing an open brolly in one hand, “It is
not every man who can do this,” truth-
fully observes the Nippon “Times.”

“Plop”; Some millions of years ago a
hairy individual brought his family down
out of a tree, found a warm cave, and
established an industry in flint arrow-
heads ; I have it on good authority that
he was the first Plop. Business was not
too brisk for a few hundred years until
the population and demand grew, and
then Plop and Co. had boom times, for
dinosaurs and the like had been trampling
down the choko vines and in general play-
ing merry hell. The firm liad their thumbs
in their bearskin braces until the Ice-Age
—the dinosaurs headed south, slump
came, and all that remained of their pros-
perous past was a stack of uncollected
arrowheads and a lot* of outsize foot-
prints in the mud. Now I see that some-
one in the American branch of the tribe
has gone back to the old line of business.
Living in Massachusetts, the clansman is
selling petrified footprints of the big
blokes for decoration of fireplaces at
200 dollars a time.
* * * ♦
“Myrr”; Advocates of footpath cafes
for Melbourne ignore three factors which
make it most unlikely that Yarra-
siders will ever sip their tea (absinthe
or coffee) out of doors, Paris-fashion.
Nowhere in the city are footpaths wide
enough to permit layout of tables and
chairs without interference with passing
pedestrians. Melbourne weather, except
for an occasional spell in an occasional
autumn, is against the custom. Aus-
tralians don’t like eating in public; they
"How about signigh my aulograph-book, mister?"
lack the unselfconscious ease of the Latins
and would regard eating and drinking
under footpath conditions as tending to
exhibitionism. Then, of course, there are
the flies.
* * * *
“Torch”: On the barber’s wall I
noticed a board which read, “Shave 6d.,
haircut Is. 6d., fancy trim 25.” “What’s
this fancy trim?” I asked. “Well,” he
said in a stentorian voice, “there are only
two real haircuts, sir. In the first we take
the clippers up about three inches; the
other, up about four and a half inches —
then shade off with the scissors. When
we don’t use clippers at all but just
scissors round the edges—that’s a fancy
trim.” He smirked around at the wait-
ing queue. “Now, sir, how would you
like yours?” In the mirror I saw the
queue hanging on my reply, and believ-
ing in the old axiom that attack is the
best form of defence I said loudly, too:
“Cut it just like yours, mate —a fancy
trim.”
* * * *
“Cauboy”: Art history, like any other,
repeats itself, and an echo of the old
Paris controversy over the Manet picture
of the nude model lying on the grass in
a sylvan landscape with her fully-dressed
companions, the artists who had been
painting her, has come from Newport,
Wales, where the purchase, by the town
council, of a nude woman smoking a
cigarette has aroused much feeling.
Asked about it, Sir Gerald Kelly, who
painted the State portraits of the King
and Queen in 1945, said that he had
painted it 20 years ago, didn’t know he
was a naughty boy, was sorry he had hurt
anybody’s feelings, but was a bit too old
to worry. It is a good example of the
tricks that environment plays with our
associations. The picture of a nude
woman can be hung in an exhibition
without hurting anybody’s feelings. A
male nude can’t unless it represents
“That’s torn it!”
Apollo, Adonis or some other allegorical
joker. Hung at Young and Jackson’s,
“Chloe” has stimulated religious cranks
to canvas-slashing, and one youth once
caused consternation by throwing a
lemonade at the lady; yet when she was
transported to a gallery in the city and
exposed in aid of war funds all respect-
able society flocked to see her. Sir
Gerald’s offence obviously was that he
painted his model smoking. The presence
of the gasper made people conscious that
she was a human being, which possibly
‘ the quality of the painting didn’t.
« * * *
“Pawang”: There are numberless ex-
amples of the ability of one sense to
help in the lack of others; the most
striking case in my experience is a Mel-
bourne horse-dealer who has been blind
from birth. He never makes a mistake
with horses, although he has never known
them except by feeling. At a city
auction he bought a mare for £35, rode
it home through all the traffic and next
day a horsey woman friend of mine went
to his stables and found he had already
sold it for £6O. His uncanny faculty
extends to inanimate as well as animate
objects. An auctioneer selling a wagon-
ette said: “This is just the vehicle for
you, Mr. X.” “No, thanks,” said the
blind dealer, “It’s got an odd wheel on
the far side.” Nobody else there had
observed it.

“8.G.H.”: Cliches (B. 3/12/’47)? The
other Saturday one Sydney daily be-
gan a book-review with a reference to a
“new star in the literary firmament.”
On the same day the rival rag carried an
article referring to Cicely Courtneidge as
“one of the brightest stars in the theatri-
cal firmament.” On another page of the
same paper was an article which dealt
with cliches —“fly-blown phrases.... be-
got by Constant Usage out of Sheer Lazi-
ness.”

“Gravelsnatcher”: The naming of
naval vessels can sometimes be too apt
(B. 31/12/’47). The first British destroyers
to be named after venomous reptiles—
Viper and Cobra—both broke their
backs on their trial runs.

“Nakhoda”: This is supposed to be the
age of rapid communications and alleged
universal knowledge, yet the stump-jump
plough, which has been a sine qua non
with Australian farmers since it was in-
vented in 1876, some say by R. B. Smith,
of Yorke Peninsula, S.A., has only just
crossed the Pacific —Washington officials,
after exhaustive tests with an H. C. Mc-
Kay-Massey. Harris, having declared it a
first-class “sage-buster.” Smith found it
equally difficult to bring his invention to
Australia’s notice. He lost the patent but
subsequently got compensation from the
S.A. Government. “My invention,” he
wrote, “has cost me some money and
some anxiety and has condemned my little
ones to all the miseries of poverty and
banishment in the bush, whereas if I had
been a successful cricketer, a good
bowler, or a rifle-shooter without pluck,
a Blondin or an acrobat, I and mine
would have escaped these ills.” But
Uncle Sam isn’t going to get his new
plough. “Because of industrial difficul-
ties” they can’t be imported in quantity
from Australia.

“Yair”: Walked around a park with a
woman who feeds eights cats in that one
spot alone —a great idea, as it keeps them
off the birds. Since her daily visits with
milk and meat the cat colony has be-
come sleeker and actually healthy. She
says the only practical gratitude she ever
received was from a Chinese lady who
came up to her and said “You kind.
Here, I give you meat coupon each week.”
She did, for six weeks—until the cat-
feeding lady was shocked to discover her
sleek cats gradually disappearing, and
the Oriental gentlewoman said blandly
“You fatten cat for my husband. You
kind. He use plenty cat in what you call
stew.”

“Tourist”: It is obvious that “Stelen”
(B. 26/11 /’47) doesn’t even know the
difference between a bus and a coach let
alone a busdriver and a coach-captain.
A bus is a public utility vehicle operat-
ing on short runs; a coach is used for
tours' of varying periods and is built for
comfort and relaxation. A busdriver has
little to do but drive ; a coach-captain
must also be able to handle the public,
as he is entirely responsible for the well-
being and enjoyment of his passengers
over extended periods. To carry out his
job successfully he must be a psycholo-
gist, a historian and general information
bureau and capable of giving a travel-
talk while the tour is in progress,

“Brolga”: Every time I read of Jeru-
salem I think of my brother Bill. I
hadn’t seen Bill since we were in
our early teens, but we were both sent to
Army schools near Latrun and happened
to meet. We got week-end leave and
went up to Jerusalem to celebrate. After
a hectic round of the cafes and night-
clubs we staggered back to our hotel.
Next morning Bill held his head in his
hands while I knocked the top off the
reviving bottle. “Tell me,” he groaned,
“did I put on my usual act last night?”
“Didn’t notice anything wrong, Bill,” I
said. “What is your usual act, anyway?”
“Oh, I generally lie down like a log in the
middle of the street and have to be
carried home,” said Bill. Which shows
you don’t know with brothers, either.

“Xenexer”: One reason for the lack
of interest in the Army’s call for recruits
may be the memories of its inefficiency.
Mistakes still being made by the Army’s
child. Commonwealth Reconstruction
Training Scheme, are perhaps a heritage
of it. In November, 1946, I was fortu-
nate enough to take a professional re-
fresher course. It was so good that when
a letter arrived in June, 1947, offering me
a full-time refresher course I immediately
sent in the forms for acceptance. Ten
weeks later I wrote asking for more de-
tails. The reply arrived in December,
1947, advising that the course offered in
June was for the one I had had in
November, 1946,

“Bolshoiy Doljishki”; Mention of the
Dynamo antics in England (B. 14/1/’4B)
recalls what is, perhaps, the most bizarre
football match in fiction —the game be-
tween the Russians and the Germans in
Yuri Olesha’s Envy. Hetzke, the German
star, is a brilliant individualist, and plays
for himself alone, like a true bourgeois.
The Russkis, of course, play for the side.
But the extraordinary thing is the effect
of Hetzke upon the Russian crowd. He
is—to quote V. S. Pritchett, in an article
in “New Statesman and Nation” —
“watched with adoring superstition and
terror. He is more than a footballer. He
is the dreaded, the half-worshipped West
itself.”
Whenever Hetzke gained possession of
the ball, Valya, sitting up in the heights,
screamed as though she were about to
witness some horrible crime. Hetzke left
our backs standing with the speed of his
attack and took a shot at goal. Valya
pressed closer to her neighbor grasping
both his hands in hers with but one thought
in her mind —to hide her eyes from the
catastrophe —but out of the corner of her
averted eyes, she continued to watch the
movements of the swarthy—smoke-black-
ened after passing through fire—Hetzke.
The book itself deals with the comic con-
flict between Babchev, an upright Com-
missar, and Kavelerov, a drunken relic
of the old order. But it was too comic.
At first the party hailed it with joy as a
scathing attack on counter-revolutionaries.
Then a suspicion that it might be some-
thing altogether different seeped through
and Olesha disappeared. Luckier than
most, he was heard of again, 10 years
later, playing a humble and politically
correct part in the “national revival” of
Turkmenia.
CONJUGAL RIGHTS.
“Stigmatising lawsuits for the restitution of con-
jugal rights as a farce and a short-cut to divorce,
Acting-Justice Rainbow (Sydney) added that he
had heard about 40 such suits in the last few days
and he did not suppose that a single one of the peti-
tioners would be prepared to take the other party
back."
Strange, is it not, that quite the easiest mode
Of shaking off the matrimonial load
By man or wife who fain would terminate
The union with an uncongenial mate
Who’s flown the coop and either strayed or
strolled
Or bolted out of the domestic fold,
Is to obtain a cure from such affliction
By means of what you’d term a legal fiction.
John, or it may be Jennifer, resorts
Wearing a martyred aspect to the Courts,
And asks the Law, inflexible and stem,
To order the a.w.l.’s return,
Though he or she is quite aware, of course,
It’s something that his Honor can’t enforce,
And, if he could, there’s nothing that would
stir
Such sheer dismay in the petitioner.
If the appeal should sway some tender heart
They know it would upset their apple-cart,
Ruin their chances of a cheap and spry
Deliverance from a galling nuptial tie.
Hence, by participants with tongue in cheek
The solemn farce is played from week to week,
Though some frank Judge will now and then
permit
Himself to tell us what he thinks of it.
Doubtless the Law may fairly be invoked
To sever those inequitably yoked.
It might be managed, though, one may conceive
Without so much of hollow make-believe.

THE SERVICE MAN
"Sick of Uniforms."
“Ek Dum”: Mr. Chambers,
one of the five Ministers who
nurture Australian defence (so
called), says that his recruiting
campaign for the Permanent
Army failed because “most
Australians are sick of uniforms
and now have the choice of a
1 variety of jobs.”
From August 5 to December
5 recruits for the P.A. totalled
1368. It was reported from
Melbourne on January 9 that
up to the beginning of the month
the number recruited had only
been 1600.
Having said that the public
are sick of uniforms, Mr.
Chambers has invented a new
one. Denying that there is to
be any slackening in recruiting
for the permanent forces, he
says that he hopes, when his new
uniform —which is calculated to
make a real soldier even “sicker”
than the old ones —is available,
the campaign would be intensi-
fied and the Government would
continue to re-enlist members of
the Interim Army instead of
discharging them progressively.
The success of that plan de-
pends on whether the Interim
Army is willing to re-enlist and
whether or not its members are
also “sick” of uniform.
At the present rate of enlist-
ment it will take Mr. Chambers
at least six years to enlist 19,000
men, and by that time some of
the originals will have died of
cobweb-disease, or have retired
because their uniforms have be-
come worn out, or because they
have been arrested by the civil
authority for impersonating
N. S. Wales traffic police, whom
they will more than anything
else resemble.
If any civil-life managing
director had such a record of
failure at his job as Mr. Cham-
bers he would long ago have
been given a week’s notice.
New Air Force
Organisation.
The British Government has
decided that the Royal Air Force
shall he the front line of United
Kingdom defence.
It was a decision which did
not need much taking, since the
Air Force has become the gun
which is most adaptable to fire
quickest any kind of missile,
steel or human, at an enemy.
The Dominions naturally
accept the principle, or at least
their military leaders do,, and
have associated themselves with
the training scheme which is
now being put into operation
with a view to providing a force
ready to operate instantly irre-
spective of weather and general
conditions.
A special squadron with
Dominion ingredients has been
allotted to the R.A.F. for co-
ordination —No. 24, an historic
combination whose commanders
will come alternately from each
Dominion involved.
In this, Australia will be re-
presented by five aircraft com-
plements, which will do a mini-
mum of two years of service
with the squadron.
The Empire Scheme
The Empire Flying School is
at Hullavington, Wiltshire. In
it the chief consideration these
days is training for blind-flying.
There are three separate
classes of pilots at the school —
“clear-weather” pilots, and two
grades qualified for instrument-
liying. The first of these latter
classes are “green-card” men,
who must have flown 750 hours
in all as first pilots, with not fewer
than 50 hours entirely on in-
stiuments, apart from having
passed a very rigid examination,
ora) and otherwise, on instru-
ments, meteorology, navigation
and flight procedure. “White-
card” pilots need to have passed
a similar examination and to
have flown five hours on instru-
ments or two hours on instru-
ments and eight hours under
simulated black conditions dur-
ing the previous six months.
Cards, both green and white, are
renewable annually, but only
upon the passing of fresh tests.
R.A.A.F.’s delegates will bring
home their knowledge and be
in a position to act as instruc-
tors in the latest technique
within our own forces.
The course will be rigid, with
plenty of rough exercises such
as deliberate flying through
cumulo-nimbus clouds as a
matter of routine, and the func-
tional machinery will be novel
and complete in each field.
Thus there will be a “hand-
ling squadron” which will anno-
“ Henry , you have NoT been taking cough tablets: they
Were my reducing pills.”
tate and instruct on all new types
of machines coming into use.
There will also be an inspection
squadron charged with the duty'
of inspecting units everywhere
within the ambit of British
Commonwealth defence, allot-
ting instructors to proper cate-
gories and rating instruments.
There is a unit which specialises
in “day-night” work —flying in
a screened cockpit in which
darkness is simulated. Various
other specialist instructional
flights, each expert in a specific
problem of flying or instrument
work, are formed or forming.
L&stly, there is a discussion
conference, worked on the plan
of a parliament, in which all
members are equal, irrespective
of rank, and in which discussions
go through three stages like a
parliamentary bill. Those which
are adopted on each of the three
readings are submitted to the
Air Ministry for adoption..
The scheme seems bound to
have important effects on train-
ing throughout the British Com-
monwealth.
The Fracas in Kashmir.
“Ek Dum”: There is little
doubt that the Indian position
is becoming more dangerous
every day and that reference to
Dr. Evatt’s Security Council
has not improved matters very
much. That futile body has
about as much chance of con-
trolling the popular passions of
India as a drop of water has of
surviving in Hades.
What is happening there is not
merely a matter of differences
by leaders, or of small but active
sections fanned into action by
leaders: it is an emanation of
age-long racial and religious
hatreds and intolerances which
have been dammed for decades
and which have now begun to
break bounds.
Incidents like that at Kar-
achi on January 6 tell the story.
There 64 Sikh men, women and
children held in the Sikh
Temple during a delay in transit
to their natural Indian areas
were slaughtered by a furious
mob almost under the shadow
of the Pakistan Secretariat,
while the police looked on help-
less or indifferent. Somebody
in authority remarked after-
wards that it had been a mis-
take to drive the unfortunates
through parts of the city on
lorries where they could be seen,
since the very sight of them was
an incitement to massacre.
The position in Kashmir is
not pretty. On December 23,
Pandit Nehru sent a letter to
the Pakistan Prime Minister
asking him to take steps to
deny all assistance to the raiders
of Kashmir and Jammu.
While the Pakistan Govern-
ment showed an innocent face
to the charges implied in the
letter, the aftermath seemed to
be a warmer and more active
development of the lighting,
which became the heaviest since
October last.
The front line is now Nao-
shera, an important cross-
roads town 50 miles north-west
of Jammu city by direct line,
but much more by road.
There, entrenched Indian
troops were attacked by smart-
uniformed levies who must have
their bases inside Pakistan.
They were steel-helmeted and
armed with field artillery,
mortars and m.gs.
It is quite obvious that, hav-
ing the support of the pre-
dominant Moslem population of
Kashmir, the raiders have the
better of the situation at present.
The Indian representation to
the Security Council makes it
quite clear that the Indian forces
cannot cope with the “insurg-
ents,” who, the Indian Note
says, number 19,000 in the
Kashmir Valley area and an-
other 13,000 in the south-
western border country.
The Indians claim that there
are a further 100,000 in adjoin-
ing districts in the West Punjab
who are being trained by Paki-
stan officers and uniformed, fed
and transported gradually to
Jammu with the help of Pakistan
official facilities.
It is threatened that if the
Security Council cannot take
effective action the Indian Army
will have to be sent into Paki-
stan to cut off the trainees from
Kashmir, with the defence of
which Pandit Nehru claims to
consider himself charged.
Whatever the Security Council
says or does there will be little

change in the influences which
govern the situation. The
sympathy of Pakistan is natur-
ally with the Kashmir popula-
tion, its co-religionists. They
would be satisfied with a
properly - conducted plebiscite,
since it would be likely to give
an overwhelming majority for
attachment to Pakistan.
Pandit Nehru, member of a
Brahman caste which has had
a finger in everything in Kash-
mir as part of the ruling class,
would as soon see Dal Lake sink
into the antipodes as have the
change of allegiance happen.
The Brahmans of Kashmir,
who have long dominated its
Government, are of a particu-
larly active type. Unlike the
Hindu of Rajputana, whose God
heroes are Vishnu “the pre-
server” and Krishna, the Kash-
miri Hindu inclines to Siva
“the destroyer” and Kali his
terrible consort, the difference
finding an outlet in a harsh
attitude towards the Moslem
population.
Prescient Hindu and Moslem
agree about the future, though
the Moslems do not talk.
Sir Dinkar Rao, a Hindu,
once said that if the British left
India the result would be the
same as if all the bars were re-
moved from the tiger-cages in
Calcutta Zoo.
And Sir Pertab Singh, a
Rajput Hindu and ardent ad-
mirer of the English —“ Lekin,
Lady, I every time happy this
Englapd. Horses is gentlemen,
ladies is gentlemen, grass is
gentlemen”—agrees.
His version was that if the
English left there would not be
a rupee or a virgin south of the
Ganges in six months. The
English are leaving in April.
Universal Training in
the United States.
President Truman, a ruler very
unlike the fellows at Canberra,
appointed a commission in 1946
to go into the question of uni-
versal military training in the
United States. Its report was
submitted half-way through last
year and is now available in
Australia.
The committee, nine civilians,
after hearing hundreds of wit-
nesses, declared itself convinced
that such training was essential
to protect the United States
against possible aggression, “to
perpetuate the for
which millions shed their blood
and to hasten the advent of uni-
versal disarmament and peace.”
The comtnittee members de-
clared themselves equally con-
vinced that without universal
training any national defence
would be inadequate.
They called attention to the
temptations offered to aggressor
nations by the fall in military
potential after the war and to
the spread of aggressive totali-
tarian ideas, remarking that the
only way in which the United
States could lend authority to its
voice in international affairs and
inspire confidence in the ability
of the United Nations to enforce
peace was to keep the armed
forces efficient enough in an all-
round way to discourage chal-
lenge.
A high officer of the American
Staff College at Leavenworth
summarises the report as say-
ing:—
A weak nation can only beg, not
command, respect and reciprocity.
This remark might well be en-
graved on Dr. Evatt’s coat of
arms. The summarised state-
ment continues:
An aggressor nation bent upon
conquest can prepare in advance ancf
select its time and place and mode
of attack. Under its Constitution the
United States cannot, and thus must
prepare against every kind of attack,
from any source Long-range air-
craft now make it possible to deliver
an attack across an ocean or the
Polar cap with increasing intensity
and suddenness. Weapons of mass
destruction have been added to the
devastating strategic warfare of World
War 11, and Pearl Harbor attacks are
vastly more probable. We will never
again have months to mobilise, train
and equip an effective fighting force.
The speed and force of future attack
make imperative the maintenance, in
a constant state of readiness, of a
counter-attacking force which can
retaliate instantly with the most
modern and powerful weapons. Un-
der these conditions every city, every
factory and every farm would become
part of the combat zone. Fifth-
column activities would precede
attack upon us, paving the way for
disunity and surrender.
So it would in Australia, where
treacherous Communists are
allowed to undermine and to
organise against the day of in-
surrection, some of them in the
heart of the civil service and the
Labor political machine.
Forms of Modem Attack
The commission laid down its
views as to the various forms
attack might take:
(1) Attack by atomic weapons,
produced in quantity, preceded by
softening-up activities espionage,
sabotage and propaganda by subver-
sive agents within the country and
their friends and tools. This phase
would probably begin months before
war actually broke out and would be
aimed to destroy war potential and
particularly industrial potential and
machinery for mobilisation and arm-
ing, as well as producing panic and
chaos.
(2) Involvement through attack in
some far part of the world by an
aggressor on its neighbors, constitu-
ting a threat to world security.
(3) An attempt by a powerful Euro-
pean nation to establish itself or its
system in Latin America, providing
a stepping-stone in the south which
would place the United States in a
vice, threatened with attack from two
directions.
The commission emphasised
that the age of push-button war-
fare was not yet here, though
open ,war, it said, would un-
doubtedly begin with devastating
long-distance air raids on civil
populations and vital military
and industrial centres. This
phase would probably be fol-
lowed by the landing of large
forces of airborne troops scat-
tered over a wide area, capable
of breaking up and disorganising
communication systems, im-
mobilising aerodromes and caus-
ing general civilian demoralisa-
tion.
Citizen Forces
It claims that the antidotes
needed to deal with these eventu-
alities are, first, a sufficiently-
trained body of professional
troops always on the alert to
intercept enemy attack, dislodge
him from bases and take pos-
session instanter of bases as
close as possible to the enemy’s
centre of operation, with a view
to striking at the heart of his
own sources of power.
Secondly, it called for pro-
perly-equipped and -trained
civilian forces organised in every
part of the country and ready
to meet disorganisation, sabot-
age and invasion and nip each
suddenly in the bud.
For the latter force especially,
it said, a complex and well-
trained force was urgent. To
shut the nation’s eyes to the
need for a large reserve of
trained manpower and to rely on
“the vague prospect of guided
missiles would be criminal negli-
gence.”
Compulsory Training
It deals with specific needs,
such as a well-co-ordinated in-
telligence service, a properly-
organised, -trained and -dispersed
industrial organisation which
could be swung to war condi-
tions on the minute,, and it names
universal training as an absolute
essential of security:
We do not believe that there is
any other way of guaranteeing that
the armed forces will tfe able to
count on a sufficiently speedy flow
of trained men to win a war, if
large-scale fighting for bases or in-
vasion of the enemy homeland are
needbd. But even more immediately
and even more certainly these pre-
trained young men will be ready to
cope with the unprecedented problems
of internal security which atomic war
will bring... .They will form the apex
(to quote Mr. Bernard Baruch) “of
a pyramid grounded on the broad
bases of industrial preparedness,
military intelligence and other ele-
meats” as part of a comprehensive
plan for national security.
As a system—against the
miserable Australian provision
of 14 days’ compulsory camp
for volunteers —the commission
calls for six months’ compulsory
basic training in camps or on
shipboard followed by service
in a very active reserve.
Small Relative Cost
The report sets out the cost of
universal training per annum at
about £600,000,000, which is only
12 times Australia’s total annual
defence cost.
It points out that this sum
would be equal to only 10 p.c.
of the annual expenditure of the
people of the United States on
tobacco, liquor, cosmetics,
amusements apd jewellery.
When it speaks of universal
training the commission means
universal, since no youngster
would be exempted. It proposes
control of the system by a com-
mission directly responsible to
the President, two of the three,
members to be civilian. This
would be supported by an ad-
visory board of 25, partly
civilian, partly military, but the
actual training programmes
would be operated by the Fight-
ing Forces commands.
Registration for All
AH male citizens would be
registered at 17 years of age and
would be liable for training on
reaching the age of 18 —or
graduating through high school,
if consent of parents were given.
It was estimated that this would
produce a flow of 1,100,000
young men per annum, of whom
only 50,000 would be unfit for
any kind of duty. Of the esti-
mated effective total probably
100,000 to 150,000 would be ab-
sorbed in the permanent forces,
leaving from 750,000 to 900,000
to enter on the universal-train-
ing programme. They would do
their six months’ basic training
under military control, but
would not be members of the
armed forces nor be subject to
the Articles of War, being
governed by special codes of
conduct and discipline author-
ised by Congress.
Upon the completion of the
six - months basic period the
trainee would be required to
adopt one of several optional
courses to complete his training
—specialist or officer training,
unit training, National Guard or
reserve of officers.
Under each of these heads
comprehensive courses are pro-
vided for in the plan, but those
who fail to exercise any of their
options would fall into a residue
class which is enfolded by the
reserve, with an obligation of
one month of service each year
for six years.
The commission recommends
the initiation of the scheme at
once, with the passage of legis-
lation to authorise continuance
of the programme for 10 years,
a special commission to sit at
the end of five years to review
the world situation with a view
to determining whether continu-
ance is necessary or serviceable.
In view of the fact that Aus-
tralia has no navy or air force
worth the name in terms of real
defence, its need for universal
training on a proper scale is
about double that of the United
States.

PERSONAL ITEMS
Having recently retired from the Staff
Corps, Colonel Jim Thyer, C.8.E.,
D. has betaken himself to his an-
cestral acres at Jamestown (S.A.) with a
library dealing with the strategy of
gardening and tactics in preparing com-
posts. One of the oldest-standing of Dun-
troon-trained signals officers of the radio
age, the veteran —he doesn’t look one —
commanded the R.A.E. at Queenscliff
(Vic.), 1927-34, was G.S.O. Darwin,
1939-40, and went to Malaya in command
of Eighth Division Signals. There he
was a guest of the Japs from February,
1942, on his release in 1945 becoming
G. to the division to help handle
its dispersal. His gardening will have to
be very good to live up to the family
record, since his paternal grandfather was
one of the most noted growers and im-
provers of wheat Australia has produced,
winning prizes for his exhibits at both
the Sydney and Melbourne International
Exhibitions of 1879 and 1880 and as far
afield as London and Calcutta.
Angus S, Mitchell, nominated as chief
or Rotary International for 1948-49, is
the first Australian Rotarian thus selected.
The choice was made in Chicago, the
Mecca of the movement, which was
started there in 1905 by Paul Harris,
lawyer, at a luncheon of three friends.
Its clubs now run to over 1000; members
to quarter of a million. Mitchell, who
will be elected automatically at the con-
vention at Rio in May, has been promin-
ent in Melbourne Rotary since 1927. A
co-founder of Mitchell, Bellair and Lees,
he has done a lot of work with hospitals,
the Y.M.C.A, and the Scouts since retir-
ing from business.
There are now two Knights Bachelor
among the 30 Westralian Ms.L.C.: Frank
Ernest Gibson, mayor of Fremantle for
upwards of quarter of a century, and Hal
Pateshall Colebatch ; and they are related
by marriage. Gibson’s daughter is Cole-
batch’s second wife. Colebatch was him-
self a mayor (of Northam, 1909-12) be-
fore he went into the Leg. Council from
an editorial chair, to become leader of
the House, Minister of Education, of
Justice and of the North-West, Premier,
Agent-General (for two terms aggregat-
ing 10 years), Senator and M.L.C. once
more. His second innings (of eight years)
is about to end ; but though he is just
on 75 nobody, expects the able and ver-
satile veteran to retire.
There is a link between the Federal
Constitution and the Emergency Bill
passed in a few minutes by the Victorian
Parliament during the tram strike.
Andrew Garran, 8.A., Oxon., who, as
Assistant Parliamentary Draftsman, drew
up the document, is a son of Robert
Garran, who as Commonwealth Solicitor-
General was one of the framers of the
Constitution. Andrew was a Victorian
Rhodes Scholar and a wing-commander
in the war, when he was on the legal staff
of the R.A.A.F. He has two distin-
guished brothers —Richard, who is a
chemist and works manager for 1.C.1. in
South Australia, and Peter, first secretary
in the British Foreign Service and just
appointed Chief of the Political Division
of the British Element in the Control
Council in Germany,
From an R.A.N. cadet in 1913 to First
Naval Member and Chief of the Naval
Staff in 1948 is now the record of John
Augustine Collins, C. 8., His war per-
formance won him the praise of all Allied
commanders ; ha saw most of the six-
years fighting from the fighting end. His
rows of decorations include the Royal
Netherlands Navy’s Commander of the
Order of Oranje-Nassau and the U.S.
Legion of Merit. He’s 49.
The Archibald Henry Peake bursary,
awarded by the Education Department in
S.A., goes this year to 17-year-old lan
E. McCarthy, of Saint’s, who topped 1947
leaving honors exams, with five credits.
From Kadina primary school he won an
entrance bursary to Saint’s, where he also
collected an intermediate bursary with
eight subjects and seven credits.
Retiring after almost quarter of a
century as president of the Victorian
R.S.L. cricket association, 73-year-old
H. J. (Jim) Martin still vividly remembers
the time W. G. Grace was bowled on the
Melbourne Cricket Ground by Bob Me-
Leod. A member of the R.S.L. (Vic-
torian branch) executive since its incep-
tion, and one-time president, he received
an 0.8. E. for his R.S.L. work.
Commander Thomas K. Morrison,
0.8. E., D.S.C., new chief of the R.A.N.
College, Flinders Naval Depot, was with
H.M.A.S. Hobart from the outbreak till
April, 1943, and was in the Java Sea
and Coral Sea fights. As a squadron
torpedo-officer of H.M.A.S. Australia he
was in the chasing of the Japs from the
landings at Hollandia to the invasion of
the Philippines at Leyte and Lingayen,
winning his D.S.C. on that job. Ashore
in his pre-war days in England he repre-
sented the R.N. at cricket in 1932, ’36
and ’3B.
O. L. Wirsu, recently appointed com-
munications superintendent of A.N.A.,
was educated at Sydney High and Uni-
versity, where he graduated D.Sc. in
Maths and Physics and B.E. in Mechani-
cal and Electrical Engineering. After six
months with the Physiology Research
Department of Sydney Hospital designing
electrical instruments he joined the Radio-
physics division of C.S.I.R. Towards the
end of the war he was engineer-in-charge
of a longe-range aircraft-detection radar
station for the R.A.A.F.; this station
was about to go into operation when the
war ended. Since leaving the R.A.A.F.
he has concentrated on the application
of radar to commercial aviation, joining
A.N.A. in 1946 as assistant communica-
tions superintendent. Last February he
was a delegate to the P.1.C.A.0. South
Pacific Regional Conference, and in July
he went to Canada and the U.S.A. to
investigate developments in radio-com-
munications and navigation equipment.
In his spare time he operates amateur
radio station VK3-ALW, Melbourne.
The naval cap in Heth’s impression of
Commander Robert Hunt, one of the
three Australians awarded the American
Medal of Freedom with Bronze Palm,
conceals a formidable forehead and a
little hair. Hunt is built somewhat on the
lines of a gracqfully-maturing oarsman
and has a voice which comes slowly and
calmly from a long way down. Pro-
voked, he can give a clear and vivid out-
line of aspects of the Pacific War. Gradu-
ating from Naval College in December,
1918, he missed out on the First World
War, but saw a respectable portion of
the second. Starting off on survey work
on the Geranium in 1925, he has been in
the Hydrographic Section ever since, and,
because of his knowledge of New Guinea
waters, was made Naval Officer in Charge
at Moresby in January, 1942, holding that
important position until August, 1943.
The command called for more than first-
class technical training—it included Milne
Bay and involved administrative prob-
lems relating to all services; for his work
there he collected an 0.8. E. On the
strategic side he considers the posses-
sion of a broad and piratical beard was
a first-class asset at the time—it gave
seniors in rank an impression that he was
NAVAL SURVEYOR.
senior in years. Later he was placed
in charge of the 7th U.S. Fleet’s
Hydrographic Section —a large and hetero-
geneous force built round an Australian
nucleus—and was first into Leyte on the
Gascoigne, doing a three-day survey job
preparatory for the invasion. That was
in October, 1944. Ten weeks later he
performed the same service for the Lin-
gayen landing. His present assignment
is the co-ordination of Admiralty charts
for Bass Strait.
Mcßeath drew this sketch of Thomas
Tuke Hollway a couple of months ago
VICTORIAN PREMIER
when the Victorian Premier had just led
his party to victory at the State elections.
The prideful grin and the grim-set jaw
were due to natural pleasure at the; win
and to a realisation that he had a big
job ahead of him. Last week represen-
tatives of striking unions had a good view
of the firm jaw, and at the week-end, after
his Emergency Powers threat had put
Melbourne trams back on the lines again,
the Premier had every excuse to indulge
himself in another grin. Hollway, at 41
the youngest Australian Premier, has
represented Ballarat since 1932. He is a
graduate in Arts and Law of Melbourne
University, and before that went to Bal-
larat Grammar, a school which also
claims Curnow, new member for Ivanhoe,
and Bolte, new member for Hampden, as
old boys. During the war Hollway served
in the R.A.A.F.; artist Mcßeath was the
officer before whom he signed his attes-
tation-papers.
“Lao-dah” on the Soongs:
So Madame Sun Yat-sen, on the authority of
an American columnist, has had a “romance”
with a U.S. Army officer and won’t give it up
under Governmental direction. She denies the
whole story. Madame, at 55 still one of the
most beautiful women in the Republic, is a
national institution, widow of the Celestial
Lenin. I remember her when she was in
Shanghai helping Sun to further his revolution
through the columns of the newspaper he pub-
lished under British protection. She is the
daughter of Soong, a Chinese apprentice born
in Boston, who ran away to sea and sub-
sequently was adopted by pious Methodists in
North Carolina. Like Sun, his inspiration was
the Bible, but whereas Sun got early Christian
Communism from it, Soong found it no
obstacle to big business. He migrated to
Shanghai, married his lovely daughters
into commercial families, including the Kung
bankers, and made an enormous fortune. The
talents of the sisters were distributed in a
curious manner, but very typical of revolu-
tionary conditions. The Kung side are con-
servative magnates who practically control the
finances of the Republic; the Chiangs, being
affiliated with Generalissimo Kai-shek, are mili-
tarists and politicians and the Suns are revolu-
tionary and Communistic. Among them they
have something to do with everything that
happens in the distracted country, from civil
wars to inflationary upheavals, but, in essence,
they are not Chinese at all but American
Methodists, a fact which would make Confucius
turn in his grave.
A. L. Bulbeck, appointed Archdeacon
of Broughton and Rural Dean of
Adelaide, is an Old Digger who became
Senior Chaplain to Corps H.Q. with the
second A.I.F. in 1940. Sussex-born, he
came to S.A. at 16, served with the 10th
Artillery Battery in World War I, was
ordained after his return, and worked
among soldier-settlers in the Murray
areas. He has been rector at Clare,
Henley Beach and, more recently, at
Christ Church, North Adelaide.
The last notes of the organ at the
Melbourne Town Hall had scarcely died
away one evening last month when
tumultuous applause broke out the
occasion was the Victorian Blind In-
stitute’s Christmas concert and the player
was Geopge Findlay. A teacher at the
Institution he is Australia’s only blind
Bachelor of Music, and an inspiration to
other sightless people. It is 30 years since
he was first led to the keyboard, but
there are few better organists or pianists
anywhere in the country.
The grand old words “App’int
Maloney” and “Are you there, Mori-
arty?” have been heard in Queensland,
with general acceptance. Maloney (T.E.)
has been stepped up from general
manager of the Government railways to
Commissioner in succession to P. R. T.
Wills, who turned 68 on November 25,
and has had a most exacting seven
years in command. Maloney him-
self is 63, so he is unlikely to
hold the position long. He goes to
£2OOO p.a., which looks miserable.
Moriarty (G.V.), who succeeds Maloney
as g.m., was boss of the Townsville sec-
tion ; he is 53. Both are Queensland
natives, and have spent all their work-
ing lives in the department, except for
service in two wars by Moriarty, who
reached the rank of brigadier in the
second.
Tim Maloney, the new Queensland
Railway Commissioner, shares a scholas-
tic memory with Governor Lavarack and
scores of other Queenslanders who have
distinguished themselves in many fields.
He was at Brisbane Grammar when
R. H. Row was headmaster; but only
for a year (1896). Then the finances
gave out and he had to take a job as a
boy porter.
A note that came with some verses
from Will Ogilvie, still going strong at
Kirklea, Selkirk, Scotland: “I rejoice in
The Bulletin’s fine full-blooded blows
at the Communists and crawlers. Never
did I admire the good old paper as much
as I do today.”
Returning to the U.S.A. after selling his
country to Victorians for the past two
years, 51-year-old Richard Fyfe Boyce,
U.S. Consul-General in Melbourne,
fought hard for the retention of the
city’s national library. When Washington
recalled the American librarians, he suc-
ceeded in transferring the books to the
Melbourne Public Library. Ever since
he has endeavored to have a permanent
American library in the city. Almost an
exile from his native land, he has spent
the last 27 years in the consulates in
Jamaica, Canada, Mexico, Peru and Cuba.
When he gets home this time it will be
for good ; he will spend his retirement in
the hills surrounding Washington.
J. Beresford Fowler, of Melbourne,
celebrated the 27th year of the founding
of his Art Theatre Players as a producer
without a theatre, his old stamping
ground, the Players’ and Playgoers’ Hall,
being wanted by the owners. It was
there that on one occasion panic seized
the direction. The stage revolver was
found to be without ammunition and a
murder was due to be committed. Fowler
sent one of his emissaries to find an armed
policeman, while he rushed before the
footlights. The loud bang that followed
would have satisfied Bland Holt.
Into the Silence:
At 54, Old Digger William John Borlase,
M.M., one-legged lift-driver at Melbourne Town
Hall for 28 years. He horrified one former
Lud Mayor by keeping his socks up with
drawing-pins driven into the wooden leg.
In Melbourne, at 80, Alexander Millar
Laughton, Victorian Government Statist and
Actuary from 1908 to 1934. Born in the
Orkney Islands, he was a Fellow of the In-
stitute of Actuaries and before joining the
Government Service was chief actuary of
National Mutual Life.
In Raleigh, North Carolina, at 86, Josephus
Daniels, Secretary to the U.S. Navy during
World War I and Ambassador to Mexico from
1933 to 1941. He was the man who made
Uncle Sam’s Navy “dry.”
At Heron Island (Q.), at 65, Professor E. J.
Goddard, of Brisbane University. Bom in
Newcastle, he graduated D.Sc. and M.A. at
Sydney University and lectured at Stellenbosch,
South Africa, before succeeding Harvey John-
ston in the Brisbane chair of biology in 1923.
He was working on the establishment of a
marine biological station on the Barrier Reef
when he died suddenly.
At Wangaratta (Vic.), at 79, Dr. John Leslie
Henderson, who practised at Glenwills and
Omeo before hanging out his shingle at Wan-
garatta half a century ago. With his wife he
helped organise the Bush Fire Brigades Asso-
ciation and founded the Milawa Herd Testing
Association.


Women's Letters
From Melbourne
Women who thought the day would be
cold and the sea breezes at Mornington
even more chilly were sorry they had
worn their winter suits to the bayside
racecourse for the Mornington Cup meet-
ing. The weather was very warm, and the
crowd larger than the committee had ex-
pected. Mrs. Maurice Nathan, smartly-
clad in a navy-blue corduroy velvet suit
and white felt hat trimmed with navy-blue
quills, was accompanied by Mrs. Arch
Aitken, whose dark grey jacket was worn
with a full-pleated skirt of matching
material. There were picnic lunches and
afternoon teas for many racegoers. The
Frank Watts entertained Major and Mrs.
George Maxwell, the Bill Cooks and other
guests at luncheon.
Many casual summer frocks were worn
by the wiser women racegoers at Morn-
ington. They were fashioned mainly of
seersucker and linen, but there were many
printed-silk frocks and large-brimmed
hats of natural straw. The wife of the
chairman of the M.R.C., Mrs. R. M.
Ansett, highlighted her patterned silk with
a white straw hat swathed in mist-blue
veiling tied under the chin. She was
with Mrs. John Cain, who wore a beige-
silk frock patterned in black under her
smart black coat; her off-the-face
natural-straw hat was finished with black
satin ribbon at one side.
Two visitors from Deniliquin, Mes-
dames Douglas Johnstone and Scott
Rogers, who are holidaying at Frankston,
were at the races. Mrs. Harold Brockoff
looked charming in a white-silk frock,
patterned in lemon-toned flowers, and a
white-crochet hat, while Mrs. Geoffrey
Grimwade was most attractive in a cool
blue-and-white-checked gingham frock
with a full skirt and unpressed pleats.
Her large natural-straw hat was banded
with the same material and her shoes
featured high platform soles.
Dressing at the Ballet Rambert for the
opening of the last week of the season
was informal, but there were several
lovely evening frocks. One was worn by
Mrs. F. H. Wright, wife of the Consul
for the Netherlands. It was of ice-blue
crepe, the skirt very full and worn with a
short jacket of ice-blue angora. She was
accompanied by two of her daughters.
Sydney visitors were Sheila Sparks, who
was informally dressed, and Len Nor-
man, who has been to the ballet every
night since arriving in this city. June
Richardson’s black taffeta ballerina
frock was worn with an entrancing little
poke-bonnet of black taffeta edged with
ruchings of pale-pink tulle. Helen Dun-
stan, who has just returned with her
parents from a trip to America and Eng-
land, wore a new-length black frock
covered with a squirrel dyed mink coat
in the latest American fashion.
Sun-glasses were worn in place of hats
by feminine spectators at the Australian
tennis championship matches at Koo-
yong. The first day’s- play saw Mrs.
John Bromwich watching her husband in
action ; she wore a grey suit striped in
chalk white. Also interested in the match
in which her husband figured was Mrs.
Max Newcombe, of S.A. A young
player who later became a spectator was
Veronica Linehan, whose pastel-pink
seersucker frock was patterned in large
blue flowers. The second day brought
warmer weather, and once again few hats
were worn. Patterned frocks and linens
were popular, and Mrs. Adrian Quist
chose a red-and-white striped silk frock
with a large red straw hat.
Mrs. Eric Gregg chose a powder-blue
lightweight-wool dressmaker suit for
Kooyong, and Maureen Wilton, who was
with fiance Dick Doyle, wore a cool
white frock and a royal-blue silk snood.
Mrs. Harry Spry was in a red-and-white-
striped seersucker, while Muriel Cheney
chose cool white linen. Mrs. Basil
Glowrey’s white frock was patterned in
cyclamen and purple flowers with a touch
of green ; Mrs. John Heathcote wore a
lightweight grey suit.
An exquisite Spanish-lace veil was
worn by Juanita Olney Fendick with her
wedding-gown when she married William
Doeven at St. Paul’s Cathedral. The
veil was bought abroad by Juanita’s
grandparents—knight Herbert Olney and
his wife. Juanita, who is the younger
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. W. G. Fen-
dick, Ivanhoe, chose a gown of pearl-
tinted satin with seed-pearl embroidery
on the yoke and with a satin bertha fall-
ing off the shoulders and the full skirt
sweeping away into a train. The lovely
veil was mounted on tulle, with a satin
halo keeping it in place. Juanita carried
a bouquet of gardenias and orchids. Her
two bridesmaids, Lorraine Drever and
Desma Watts, were frocked in pale-pink
satin, net yokes highlighting the bodices,
and very full skirts falling from a natural
waistline. They also wore haloes of satin
and carried flowers to match their frocks.
The Rev, R. McQuie performed the cere-
mony.
Best man was Kevin Drever, cousin of
the bridegroom; Ron Heywood was
groomsman. Two hundred guests were
invited to the cocktail-party given by the
bride’s parents at the Australia. Mrs.
Fendick wore a small hat massed with
pink ostrich-feathers, while Mrs. Doeven
wore black highlighted with blue gloves
and bag. Mrs. H. P. Christmas, wearing
a beige-and-green hat with her beige
frock, came from Sydney for the wedding
with her daughter, Margaret, who was
smart in a black frock with a filmy-black
lace yoke and a small hat trimmed with
black ostrich-feathers. Mrs. Keith Mills
wore a mist-blue frock and a large cycla-
men straw hat matching her gloves. Mrs.
Michael Ryan, who had just flown in
from Tasmania, wore pink marquisette
patterned in large black flowers and a
wide-brimmed black straw hat. Mrs. Carl
Randall’s pretty pale-green chiffon frock
was set off by her black lacey straw hat;
Mrs. Wallace Mitchell, up from Franks-
ton to see Juanita married, chose a black
frock and large black hat.
Mrs. Roy Honeyman is one of Mel-
bourne’s best-known charity workers and
a leading light in the Whernside Auxiliary,
which works for the Royal Melbourne
Hospital. On March 5, at St. Kilda Town
Hall, the centenary of the Royal Mel-
bourne Hospital will be celebrated by a
ball which will be attended by the
Governor and Lady Dugan with their
personal staff. Mrs. Honeyman is con-
venor of the “monster raffle” for the
ball; prizes, donated by public-spirited
firms and private citizens, include a flight
to Sydney, three oil paintings and nylon
stockings. Mrs. Honeyman has formed
an efficient committee to help her dispose
of the tickets. Broothorn portrait.
John and Stella Thonemann received
many congratulations on their recent
marriage when they gave a buffet dinner-
party in the Gowrie Room of Menzies.
John, a Melburnian, on leave from the
Chicago University, where he is Associate-
Professor of Physics, will take his wife
back to America with him early in
February. Stella chose a short dinner-
frock of pale-blue-and-silver lame for the
dinner-party. The skirt was the new
length and the deep neckline was trimmed
with three strings of large pearls. Her
sister-in-law, Mrs. John Masters, chose a
pleated frock in mist-grey and, with it,
wore a short jacket of ruby-red velvet.
Arthur Jones and his wife came specially
from Cowes to attend the party,
Mrs. Jones wearing a saxe-blue crepe
frock with lace insets trimming the bodice.
Greta Toohey was attractive in a white
floral-patterned frock and hydrangeas in
a deep-mauve toning, worn in place of
a hat; Cynthia Ferguson highlighted her
primrose crepe frock with white flowers.
Mary, elder daughter of knight Hugh
Devine and his lady, has announced her
engagement to Edward, elder son of Mrs.
E. L. Gleeson, Tarcombe, Little River,
and the late Mr. Gleeson. Mary is an
old Mandeville Hall girl and now holiday-
ing at Flinders. A diamond solitaire
marks the engagement.
Another interesting engagement is that
of Anne Dunstan, youngest daughter of
Mrs. D. Dunstan, Mt. Eliza, and the late
J. R. Dunstan, to Bob Green. Anne was
a member of the W.A.A.A.F. for over
four years, and is now a Children’s
Hospital trainee. Bob, eldest son of
Mrs. Isabel Green, of Melbourne, and
the late G. C. Green, is also a nephew
of R. G. Menzies. During the war he
served with the R.A.A.F. as a squadron-
leader. There has been no housing
problem—after the wedding, on February
28 at Mt. Eliza Church of England, the
couple will move into a flat in Kew.
From Sydney
Flynn of the Inland is to have a 20ft.-
high cairn erected to commemorate the
splendid job he has done for Australia
in visualising and founding the Aus-
tralian Inland Mission and the Fly-
ing Doctor Service. The cairn will be
built at the intersection of the North-
South road and the East-West road,
Northern Territory. It will be of dark
local stone with a white cement cross on
each face. Subscriptions to the cost —
£soo—can be sent to the A.1.M., c/o
Presbyterian Church office in any capital
city. Padre John Flynn is one of
this Letter’s pin-up heroes. He is, and
will remain, one of the greatest bene-
factors the Outback has ever known.
A Canadian alliance ratified at St.
Mark’s and celebrated in the Pickwick
Club was the marriage of Bruce Rankin
and Mona Miller. Bruce, who is Assistant
Trade Commissioner for Canada, is from
Saskatchewan, and Mona’s parents, the
Roy Millers of Vaucluse, were formerly
of Ontario. Even last Wednesday’s high
wind and sloshing rain didn’t prevent
Canadians from as far away as Canberra
turning up at St. Mark’s in full regalia.
Guests’ wedding garments were super.
The bride, too, was a picture in tradi-
tional white-satin frock and flowing tulle
veil.
At the Pickwick Club, where the parents
of the bride received the guests—about
200 of them —and the Bruce Rankins re-
ceived congratulations, the atmosphere of
Canada ran riot, from the maple-leaves
and the stand massed with Canadian fruits
in the alcove near the entrance to the
scooped-out halves of watermelons spil-
ling over with berries—blueberries, logan-
berries, currants and strawberries. These
made effective decoration on the buffets
set about the rooms. As one man pointed
out happily, “all these decorations are
edible!” The champagne was not
Canadian. It was of the best French ex-
traction. Canada’s High Commissioner
Greene, his wife and daughter Patsy were
at the party. Canada’s Trade Commis-
sioner Croft was one of the night’s im-
.portants. There were two ’maids in apri-
cot crepe—bride’s sister Joyce and Mollie
Blayney. Father of the bride has an
interest for the racing world —he is part-
owner of San Mateo.
This photograph of Mrs. G. L. Brooks,
president of the Country Women’s
Association of N. S. Wales, was taken
just before Christmas. Mrs. Brooks has
given long service to C.W.A. before com-
ing to her present office. She has been
president of the Hume group for some
time, and vice-president of the associa-
tion for two years or more. Her station
home named Jounama is up Tumut way,
back of Yarrangobilly Caves (and the
winds can blow pretty chill up that way).
Mrs. Brooks will be in Sydney again in
February to attend the meeting of the
executive committee of the association
when the agenda for the conference in
May will be decided on. Norton Trevaire
photograph.
Friday, January 23, is the night chosen
for the next Sydney Younger Set dance,
to be held at 169 Elizabeth-street, head-
quarters of the Torch Bearers for Legacy.
Through 1948 these dances will be a
regular fortnightly feature of this group’s
activities, and those who attended the
dances last year will remember them with
pleasure. Kay Rockwell (phone B 4681)
for details.
A meeting of the committee of the Reg
Willoughby Testimonial will be held in
the Women’s Clubrooms, 167 Elizabeth-
street, on Wednesday, January 21, at
10.30 a.m. Mrs. Alice Young, as before,
is hostessing this meeting, and the morn-
ing coffee session to follow. Mrs. C. T.
Lorenz is giving a party on Sunday,
February 8, at 275 Edgecliff-road,
Woollahra, at 8.15 p.m. Fifty guests
(not more, to ensure comfortable seating)
will be welcome (10s. 6d. each), and “a
cup of cheer” will be “dispensed” on
arrival and departure, in addition to
supper. A programme of music and films
has been arranged by singer Alice
Prowse. Preferential bookings for the
Conservatorium concert to aid the fund
can ba arranged at this evening party.
Lady Dill, who holds the rank of
lieutenant-colonel in the British Red
Cross, arrived in Sydney by flying-boat
last Friday. With her were daughter
Sonia arid her secretary, Betty Henell.
They left almost at once for Maoriland,
where Lady Dill will be the guest of the
Government. She will spend a month or
so there before returning to Australia.
Unusual background for her wedding
was chosen by Patricia Malley last Satur-
day. Patricia, all in white lace and tulle,
was married on board the minesweeper
H. Reserve, of which her ’groom,
lan Broben, is first-lieutenant. The ship
was in dry-dock at Cockatoo Island.
Chaplain H. Fawell, of H.M.A.S. Aus-
tralia, gave the bride away.
If you heard Canadian Marion Royce,
of World Y.W.C.A., giving her broadcast
talks you know how very pleasing her
speaking voice is. Added to that Marion
is tall and fair and has charm of manner
and altogether proved an attractive guest-
of-honor at the Y.W.C.A. lunch last
Monday. Marion is secretary for Social
Questions and Public Affairs World Y.W.,
and when that is looked into it seems as
all embracing as human nature. Miss
Royce’s sphere of work is really among
thei girls, stimulating them to interest in
public affairs and citizenship, but there
were many men at the lunch. Big busi-
ness was there, and the law, and other
professions. Last night there was a
buffet-supper, too, for Marion, who leaves
for Maoriland today in continuance of
her tour of the Pacific —objective com-
piling information on social questions,
particularly in regard to industry.
Cocktails at the Australia for Mrs.
Olive Ingall, before she left for her
home - town, Brisbane, last week.
The affair was a celebration. One
of the musical directors of the 8.8. C.,
Anton, has put three of Mrs. Ingall’s songs
in his 8.8. C. programmes: “My Lute and
I, “Idyll” and “Dark Hour,” and is now
eagerly waiting for more. Olive, who
writes both words and music, has also
written some film scripts and stage plays,
Sydney writer Mrs. Allen Innes is still
on her wanderings. She and her husband
ffew to Suva by the Coriolanus via
Noumea, which Mrs. Innes describes
as a little town like a suburb of
New Orleans. Of New Caledonia she
says: “It is utterly unlike any other
Pacific Island, with the great scars and
structures of the nickel-mines in the
valleys and the herds of cattle grazing
over the grassy hills.” Mrs. Innes spent
some time in Suva, where as a girl she
had done her nurse’s training in the
Colonial Hospital. She also paid a visit
to her cousin’s plantation home on Wak-
aya Island, Lomaviti. This is very old
and historical and was a “larder island”
where the old cannibal chiefs fattened
their victims. The “lovos” or stone ovens
are 'still there. - Norfolk Island and then
Maoriland will also be visited by the
Sydney couple before their return. Enzed
will be their postal address for January
and February.
Australians from every State visiting
London have called at the lovely little
Tyburn Convent at the back of Marble
Arch overlooking Hyde Park. This has
been the home for many years of Sister
Mary Anthony, the great Oscar Asche’s
sister. Like all .the Asches she was a
Sydneyite, having been born on Brick-
field Hill. She sends a letter of New
Year greetings to friends in this city,
tells what some of us did not know, that
the old-fashioned, gabled No. 6 which
was Tyburn Convent was destroyed by a
bomb. However, the community simply
moved into No. 9 until they can get per-
mission to build. Sister Anthony herself
now lives in St. Benedict’s Priory, Roy-
ston, Herts., where the nuns grow their
own vegetables and had enough apples
last year to store them against winter.
Sydney singer Dorothy D’Orn went to
America a few months before Christ-
mas. When she arrived she took up
musical therapy and was heard at the
Veterans Hospital in Los Angeles. In
Southern California she also sang and
recorded for the National Broadcasting
Company. Dorothy, who is well known
in Sydney and Melbourne as a concert
and broadcasting artist, has given a
Sunday-afternoon concert in the Town
Hall, New York. The Australian soprano
received excellent notices from such
papers as the New York “Times” and
New York “Sun.” At her concert she
introduced two songs by Sydney com-
poser Varney Monk. Just now Dorothy
is staying in New Milford.
Dr. Nanette Waddy and Dr. Russ
Godby, both on the staff of the Repatria-
tion Hospital at Concord, are among
the newly-engaged. Nanette’s parents.
Dr. and Mrs. Granville Waddy, gave a
cocktail-party of dimension at their
Bellevue Hill home to celebrate their
daughter’s engagement.

Continued and profitable all-round ex-
pansion of activities, by absorption and
otherwise, remains the keynote of this
big self-supporting complementary group,
which turns out felt piece-goods, carpets,
footwear, dress cloths, men’s suits and
wool-tops and yarns. There are some two-
score of subsidiary and associated cos.
scattered throughout the Commonwealth,
Maoriland and South Africa.
In Feb., 1947, the parent lifted nominal
capital to £5,000,000 by creation of
3,000,000 new £1 shares. Of these
312,578 ords. were put out, one-for-four,
at a premium of 100 p.c. in May last, and
a further 10,000 f.-p. ords. were issued
in payment for new subsidiary footwear
interests in N.S.W. The share premiums
(£312,578), which were added to reserves,
were the work of the Capital Issues
Board, and make earnings and divs. worth
only half the declared rate on the amount
of capital concerned. Since end 1936 —
just after the public became
no less than £1,692,960 has been added
to paid capital, raising it to £1,812,890
in 40,000 first and 200,000 second prefs.,
both 6 p.c, cumulative, and 1,572,890
ords. Of the increase the public put up
£1,352,165, bonus scrip accounts for
£135,500, the balance being issued in
part-payment for, subsidiary and associ-
ated interests.
Not long after the close of
accounts, the parent further extended its
interests in Maoriland by purchase of
all the ords. in Korma Textiles (N.Z.),
Ltd. (paid capital £250,000, one half
ords., and the other half 5 p.c. prefs).
Payment was in 112,126 f.-p. ords. in
Felt and Textiles of Aust., Ltd., which has
since taken a further 150,000 ords. for
cash, making its total holding 275,000
ords. Also the new subsidiary has lifted
its nominal capital to £1,000,000 by
creation of 125,000 new 5 p.c. prefs.—
to be offered to its existing pref. holders,
one-for-one at par, on March 1 next —
and 475,000 new ords., to be put out as
and when required, Korma Textiles
(N.Z.), Ltd., was formed in May, 1946,
and bought all the shares in Korma Mills,
Ltd., Auckland, which turns out knitted
woollen goods from yarns supplied
mostly by Felt and Textiles (N.Z.), Ltd.
Korma netted £13,916 for the year to
June 30 last, of which pref. divs. took
£2967. No ord. div. was paid. Presently
the co. hopes to supply most of the
knitted woollen goods required in the
Dominion.
Jo help finance expansion of the
Korma business, and because of diffi-
culties associated with transfer of funds
from Australia, Felt and Textiles of
Aust., Ltd., sold privately an unstated
portion of its holding in its other Maon-
land subsidiary. Felt and Textiles ot
N.Z., Ltd., in which it still holds a con-
trolling interest, at 455. 9d. ords. and
245. Bd. prefs.—market quotes at the time
were 61s. 3d. ords. and 28s. 6d. prefs.
Capital-profit on the deal was £149,208.
Last term there was a substantial in-
crease in production throughout the
entire organisation, and turnover of the
group shot up to £12,806,019. Of each
£1 of turnover, materials took 13s. 2d.,
wages and salaries 3s. Id., other exes.
2s. 3d. and taxation sid., leaving
for dividends and reserves. Wpol is the
chief basic raw material used. Although
the scouring, carbonising and topmaking
plants worked to capacity, they were 12
months behind the order-book for some
lines at the close of accounts. Another
pleasing feature is that an export trade,
including the dollar area, has been de-
veloped in tops and scoured wools.
After deducting outside interests, allow-
ing £294,135 (down £18,722) for taxa-
tion and £254,239 (up £94,475) for de-
preciation, and including an unexplained
addition of £24,260 to reserves, aggregate
net earnings of the group were £89,707
stronger at £326,573. That covered pref.
divs. (£14,400) and 22.6 p.c. on average
ord. capital employed, compared with
17.8, 14.8, 16.4, 14.4, 16.3, 13.6 and
20.6 p.c. back to 1940. The div., steady
at 10 p.c. for the preceding decade, was
lifted to 12i p.c., of which 3i p.c, was
tax-free. Quick and profitable em-
ployment was obviously found for the
new capital and share-premium money
got in during the year. Also the
£1,000,000 of 4 p.c. debenture money
gathered in 1946 is earning a lot more
than its keep. The year’s profit plus de-
benture interest was about 10 p.c. on
share capital, reserves and debentures
combined.
So rapid was the expansion that the co.
went outside for an extra £1,087,008

was £425,769 stronger. Still, when the

The market, which notes the wide
margin between earnings and distribu-
tions, prices the ords, at 675. 6d. Official

This big jam- and fruit-canning and
-preserving organisation was set on its
feet by Henry Jones and A. W. Palfrey-
man 38 years ago. The idea was to elimi-
nate waste in buying and selling, as well
as overlapping in organisation. The suc-
cess achieved can be judged from the fact
that, for the first 20 years, divs. averaged
10.8 p.c., sweetened with £455,492 of
bonus scrip in 1927. For the next half-
dozen difficult slump years the average
was 7.5 p.c., and for the dozen years to
the close of last accounts 10.1 p.c. And
at end October last there was £2,315,661
of visible reserves to support and assist
the £1,453,173 of paid capital. Of the
22 operating subsidiaries in the group, 11
are in Australia, and the other 11, com-
prising seven manufacturing and four
merchandising units, are in Maoriland,
South Africa and Britain.
Last term a good season bumped up
output, for which there were ready mar-
kets at satisfactory prices at home and
abroad. Australian exports of jams,
jellies and preserved fruits nearly doubled
for 1946-47, and S. Africa enjoyed a
similar experience. So, despite steadily
rising costs, and after allowing whatever
was considered necessary for taxation and
depreciation, Australian profits improved
by £27,099 (19.7 p.c.) and profits earned
outside Australia by £62,122 (72.4 p.c.):
Net income— 1939. 1945. 1946. 1947.

Total .. £268,289 £319,676 £223,210 £312,431
The arresting feature is the jump in earn-
ings of overseas factories. “We may yet
have to record that their profits have ex-
ceeded those of the whole of Australia,”
the chairman says. A new factory at Port
Elizabeth is now ready for work, making
a total of four in S. Africa. Including an
unexplained addition of £15,485 to re-
serves, combined net earnings of the
group were £111,934 stronger at £327,886.
That was 22.5 p.c. on capital as against
14.8, 22.7, 16.3, 19.2, 17.7 and 19.8 p.c.
back to 1941. On shareholders’ funds
(capital and reserves combined) the year’s
profit was 8.7 p.c. The cautious board
kept the div. at 10 p.c., leaving more than
was distributed to put on the shelf.
As for the current term, a heavy crop
of fruit is in prospect in Australia, where
there is a shortage of labor for picking
and of tinplate for canning. Also, on
the basis of last year’s output, the co. ex-
pects increased costs arising out of the
40-hour week, wage lifts and higher price
of materials, etc., to amount to approxi-
mately £500,000. This moved the chair-
man to the following pertinent remarks:
Our selling prices will reach a record high,
and we do not hesitate to warn our shop-
keepers against overstocking. The rising
spiral will probably give place to a down-
ward trend before the end of 1948.
After allowing for annual leave, gazetted
holidays, sick-pay and time for morning
and afternoon teas, actual working hours
in the industry now average only 33 per
week.
The year’s brisker trading, and other
things, are further reflected in the follow-
ing comparison of consolidated balance-
sheet figures:

Stocks and debtors’ balances increased by
£82,792 and £204,206 respectively. The
growth of £188,090 net in the, book value
of fixed assets reflects the purchase of
land at Welshpool (W.A.), where a new
factory is to be erected, and completion
of the factory at Port Elizabeth. The
more-or-less liquid surplus (£2,455,043)
was £51,835 stronger than at the previous
balance. Still further expansion is con-
templated, and the board has “under
consideration the advisability of offering
a new issue to shareholders,” details of
which are to be announced in due course.
At 755. (61s. a year ago), the pound
shares, visibly covered by 51s. lOd. in net
tangibles, give an immediate return of 2.6
p.c, on a 10 p.c. div. basis. A one-for-
three new issue at a premium of 100 p.c.
would lift the return to 3 p.c. on a 10 p.c.
div. basis, or to 3.6 p.c. if the distribution
was lifted to 12 p.c.

Dividends have been tax-free since 1942.
Though the shares of this efficient en-
gineering business have been listed since
1941 on Brisbane’s Stock Exchange, they
remain so closely held that it qualifies
as a “private” co. for tax purposes. The
considerable fluctuations in net profit
over the past six years have been caused
almost entirely by the biennial see-saw
action of undistributed-profits tax as
applied to private cos. (a large tax-pay-
ment in respect of one year being deduc-
tible from assessed income of the year
following). Profits earned before tax and
depreciation provisions have, in fact,
been very consistent:

* Chairman’s estimate of total liability.
Whilst paying good tax-free divs. over
those six years, the board built up re-
serves by an amount exceeding total paid
capital. In this way it financed a suc-
cessful large-scale entry into shipbuild-
ing, which entailed trebling the scale of
properties and plant. From a zero start
in 1940, the co.’s seven-acre shipyard on
Crown land at Kangaroo Point had by
the end of the war turned out 11 cor-
vettes, two oil-fighters, three merchant
ships (9000 tons) and other vessels. Re-
pair jobs on naval and merchant ships
are performed in the co.’s South Brisbane
graving docks, whilst factories at Rdck-
lea and South Brisbane carry on the
normal pre-war engineering activities.
Co. also conducts a distributing agency
for a wide range of overseas and local
products.
All sections have so far been kept busy
with post-war orders. Last year one
“B”-class and two “A”-class merchant
freighters were completed for the Ship-
building Board, and two more “B” (6000-
ton) types are under construction. An
accumulated war-time demand for heavy
engineering jobs—oil-storage tanks, bridge
steelwork, railway equipment, etc. —has
extended the Rocklea shops to capacity.
Co.’s staff numbers more than 1200, com-
pared with about 700 in 1939 ; and fixed
assets, which increased by £25,166 last
term, are almost four times the pre-war
figure;—

Rawang Tin Fields, Ltd.
For the year to end March
last this co. (paid capital
£876,004 in 10s. shares) netted
£17,692, or 2.4 d. a share, from
months’ work with one
dredge. No. 3. That was
after allowing £20,000 for
depreciation and £Bll6 for
shut-down exes. The co. is one
of the Anglo-Oriental group and
operates in the Rawang and
Serendah valleys, Malaya. No. 3
dredge is a 300,000-c.y.-a-month
all-electric machine built in
1939. It began production again
in May, 1946. Work was cur-
tailed for about three months to
mid-Jan., 1947, and .then ceased
until the following April, owing
to shortage of coal at the power-
house. The 1,362,000 c.y. of
material handled yielded 360.3
tons t. 0., an average of 0.591 b.
per yard. Costs were 6.76 d. a
yard. In addition 18.75 tons
t.o. were recovered from 94,000
c.y. during trial runs, and 25.19
tons t.o. from amang, making
total recoveries 404.24 tons t. 0.,
assaying 75.9 p.c,, or 306.84 tons
metallic tin. In terms of metal-
lic tin average price received
was £339 14s. sd. per ton, of
which royalties took £47 6s. 10d.,
smelting charges £lB os. lOd.
and all-in costs £245 17s. 2d.,
leaving £2B 9s. 7d. net.
Rehabilitation of No. 2
dredge, a 250,000-c.y.-a-month
all-electric machine, is retarded
by delay in delivery of materials.
A start has been made to de-
water the paddock in which the
14in. sluicing plant was sub-
merged during the occupation.
The old No. 1 dredge (175,000
c.y. a month) was completely
dismantled by the Japs and is of
no further use. At the power-
house only one turbo set has
been operating; the other two
are expected to be in commis-
sion before long. The boilers
are being converted from coal-
to oil-burners.
At end March last there was
approximately 757 acres, con-
taining about 50,000,000 c.y. of
half-pound ground, or a bit
better, to be worked. Applica-
tion for 840 acres of adjoining
tin-bearing State ground is
under consideration by the Gov-
ernment ; and the co. has a one-
third interest—Larut and Anglo-
Oriental are the other two part-
ners—in 55,000,000 c.y. of un-
worked 0.571 b. ground at Bang-
toe, Siam.
When the books closed
current assets totalled £148,013,
of which £81,334 was stores.
There was £29,323 coming to
sundry creditors, and a rehabili-
tation loan of £31,162 had been
received from the Government.
Co. also holds 63,800 shares in
Rawang Concessions (32 p.c.
paid capital) and 1837 shares in
Anglo - Malayan Development,
Ltd. Since the close of accounts
£28,878 of cash and other items
written-off on war account has
been recovered, and the rehabili-
tation loan has grown to
£107,714, with more to come.
All money values quoted are in
sterling.
Although costs are rising
rapidly in Malaya, where, for the
first time, the Government has
decided to impose income tax,
the London price of tin recently
shot up to £519 a ton. The f.-p.
10s. shares lately fetched
10s. Bd. on Sydney ’Change. In
1940 the co. netted £58,486 and
paid l\d. a share (£54,750) with
tin at £234-odd a ton. Turn-
over was 5,721,000 c.y., and
costs 2.56 d. a yard.
Westralian Mines Depart-
ment reckons that the State has
uranium possibilities in two
places, namely Pilbara in the
north and on the south coast
near Albany. The pegmatite at
Pilbara contains minerals from
which uranium, radium and
thorium might be extracted, and
the sands on the spiuth coast
contain ilmenite, which could be
a source of uranium.
Including £18,491 brought for-
ward, Hampton Gold Mining
Areas (W.A.) showed a deficit
of £8919 for year ended March,
1947. Approximately £7071 of
this loss was spent on prospect-
ing and development, which the
directors say is now represented
by the enhanced value of hold-
ings on Block 59, Hampton
Plains. They add that New Zea-
land Crown Mines', Ltd., of
which C. T. Ley is chairman,
has a controlling interest in
Hampton Areas. Mr. Ley, who
recently visited Westralia, is also
chairman of North Kalgurli,
Ltd.

GUARANTEED NEVER TO FADE OR SHRINK
SUNDRY SHOWS
"Time Off.”
Previewed last week and
promised for Sydney State, Mel
Nichols’s film, “Time Off,” is
the kind of nature study that
should interest and delight
everyone, from Australian and
overseas audiences to the platy-
pus, lyre-birds, bower-birds and
other sma’ beasties that figure in it.
Except for a spell in the
R.A.A.F. Nichols spent about
five years on the film, ranging
from north Queensland to Tas-
mania. The result is a remark-
able and completely engaging
study, in picture and sound, of
Australian bird- and animal-life,
much of it rarely seen or heard
except by confirmed naturalists.
A lyre-bird “dancing” under
the beautiful shimmering lace of
its tail and running through a
stream of mimicry of bush
sounds; bower-birds strutting,
dancing and grumbling around
their bower ; a rufous whistler
hatching ; the comedy of a tree-
martin feeding its young; a
platypus swimming, diving and
nosing through sticks and mud
■ —Nichols has caught all these
at close quarters, and many
more.
There is an undeniable charm
in the records of naturalists
who prowl with notebook and
camera, so there is an even
stronger fascination in a record
made with a moving camera and
microphone. An emu with
chickens, bellbirds, whip-birds,
wagtails nesting, a spotted
pardalote digging a burrow for
its nest, have probably been seen
by about one-fiftieth of Aus-
tralians or less. “Time Off” has
studies of them all, most of them
close-ups.
It is an extraordinary film of
which more will be said later,
and it must have taken extra-
ordinary patience and perse-
verance to make it. To temper
enthusiasm with the weight of
criticism it must be recorded
that the production could do
with some pruning, that the
commentary by Wilfred Thomas
is a little fruity in places, that
some of the tranquil bush
scenery does not need a musical
accompaniment and that a talk-
ing budgerigar, interesting as it
may be, does not merit the space
allotted to it in a film which is
mainly concerned with wild life.
Those are the film’s faults,
but it is good enough to carry
them easily. It is not made as
an organised sight-seeing expe-
’ dition but as a casual bush stroll,
and in any such walkabout there
are always a few, easily-endured
idle stretches, particularly if
some of the wild life that the
film offers is on show. And
since every Australian film
made these days has to be con-
sidered for overseas markets,
this one can be recommended
without qualification as being a
better advertisement for this
country than 95 per cent, of our
celluloid exports to date.
* * * *
“Christmas Eve” (Sydney
Empire): Concerns an eccentric
old lady (Ann Harding) about
to have her millions taken from
her by a nephew (Reginald
Denny) on the grounds of her
insanity. Three wayward
adopted sons a gangster
(George Raft), a playboy
(George Brent) and a cowboy
(Randolph Scott) —turn up on
Christmas eve to prove that the
nephew’s a crook and that the
old soul is as normal as anyone
else in the film.
* * * *
“The Marauders” (Sydney
Empire): William Boyd as Hop-
along Cassidy riding what must
be his millionth mile and firing
his millionth shot, this time in
defence of a deserted church
and a dark-eyed wench who
cherishes it. There’s oil under
the church, of course, and as
many toughs as Mr. Cassidy
can comfortably handle (about
20) after it.
Ballet Rambert.
The Ballet Rambert is canter-
ing to a finish at Melbourne
Princess, where the length of its
season was a tribute to its versa-
tility. It is a small organisation,
but what it lacked in size it made
up for in the individual quality
of its dancers. It will be suc-
ceeded on January 26 by Doris
Fitton and her Independent
Theatre company in “The Little
Foxes” of Lillian Heilman.
Anouilh’s “Antigone,” a, satire
on modern manners in the
Greek form, is likely to follow,
and also “Mourning Becomes
Electra,” which the same com-
pany played to full houses at the
Comedy two years ago.
Madame Rambert no longer
dances, though there seems to
be no reason why she shouldn’t,
judging by the way she leaps
the hedge of horticulture
at the final curtains. She
has the French wit, too, and
can tell a good story. On one
occasion when she was going to
the Malvern festival in England,
she met Shaw and they walked
along together. Shaw is a tall
man and Madame is exception-
ally small. Shaw strode along
talking 90 to the dozen, and, as
is his wont, didn’t bend his body.
The little dancer, trotting
alongside, couldn’t catch a word
of the discourse that was raining
down from the eminence above
her, but didn’t like to admit it,
so, knowing Shaw’s reputation
for wit and humor, every half a
minute she burst into loud peals
of laughter. When the strangely-
assorted pair reached the portals
of the theatre Shaw, who hadn’t
stopped talking for a second,
bent down, shook the ballet-
mistress by the hand and said
with intense solemnity: “And
then she died! ”
"The Kiwis.”
The Maoriland band of
Diggers who call themselves
“The Kiwis” are now in their
second year at Melbourne
Comedy, and look like being
there for another 12 months
judging by the reception given
their latest programme, “Ben-
ghazi.” If they have more up
their sleeve like it their occupa-
tion of' the theatre will prob-
ably amount to annexation.
What the provender provided
has to do with the Libyan sea-
port isn’t made clear, but that
doesn’t matter. The organisa-
tion has whips of talent, rang-
ing from an entertaining juggler
to an orchestra which can switch
from swing to Tschaikowsky,
and six of the heroes have suffi-
ciently good voices to render
the songs of the Maoris and
make them sound engaging.
The company, like that of the
late William Shakspeare, has no
women in it, but Bill Bain gives
a stage burlesque of the species,
and John Hunter gives a re-
markably good imitation of a
ballerina. In fact, when he leaps
lightly on to the boards and
whizzes around it on his toes it
is difficult to believe that it isn’t
a member of the Ballet Rambert
who has slipped found during an
interval. His impression of a
homecoming soldier and his
dialogue with his wife, in which
he takes both parts, is exceed-
ingly clever. The show is typi-
cal soldier stuff French-polished
for metropolitan consumption.
”Fine Feathers."
“Fine Feathers” is Sydney
Tiv.’s last burst of variety for
some time —the Ballet Rambert
takes over the theatre at the end
of this month and Laurence
Olivier’s Old Vic. company will
move in when the dancers move
out. The feathers in the current
programme include the Glenns,
three acrobatic dancers who per-
form a back-breaking routine
without visible effort; Warren,
Latona and Sparks, three expert
purveyors of humor and fall-
about; and McConnel and
Moore, jugglers who, with per-
fect timing, almost hide them-
selves behind a whirl of flying
clubs.
The crest and tailfeathers of
the display are Vic (“Quitsie”)
Puree and Cliff Cook, both
comic contortionists in their
own way and both very good.
Puree, a diminutive clown,
seems able to do anything with
his face except swallow his ears
—and he comes perilously close
to that at times. Cook is a flat-
voiced, melancholy clown with a
dry, amusing patter and a spine
which, if it isn’t India-rubber,
is a better substitute for it than
any synthetic yet made.
Melbourne National Gallery,
which seems to have an obses-
sion for the work of William
Blake and has an immense col-
lection of his drawings, is show-
ing a selection of his watercolor
illustrations of Dante’s Divine
Comedy. They make an ob-
server wonder how Blake got
his reputation. His draughtsman-
ship is stiff and academic and
he has no sense of color. As a
depictive artist he was singu-
larly deficient, and the monotony
of his design is irritating. His
bearded patriarchs and saints
would be taken for comics in
any other environment. He may
have been a fine poet and a dis-
tinguished mystic, but he knew
as much about the visual arts
as a cow does about grand
opera.
“C. 8.”: Modernist art? An
amateur yachtsman in Mel-
bourne who dabbles a bit in
art was painting his yacht at the
beginning of the season. As he
painted in various colors he kept
cleaning his brush of surplus
pigment by wiping it on a board
which, at the finish of the job,
looked as charming as the
palette of any artist. His mates
purloined the board, framed it,
signed his name on it and sent
it to an exhibition with the title
“Disintegration of the Un-
conscious” or something. It was
hung and obtained laudatory
references from at least two
critics.

YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
At Rosehill on Saturday rain had
somewhat softened the track, while
the weather was positively bleak;
conditions which proved very much
to the liking of the few ex-New
Zealand gallopers engaged.
In the seven-furlongs Flying, Far-
had (W. Briscoe) came with a power-
ful late run to just nab the pace-
maker, Rose Glory; third being
Critique. Farhad, who had had only
one previous run here, is a three-
year-old chestnut gelding with breed-
ing good enough to offset the pre-
judice aroused by his full set of
long white hosiery. He’s by Nizami,
which speaks for itself, and out of
a particularly well-bred mare, Dig-
nified (by the Gainsborough horse
Dignity and out of Queen Warbler,
a daughter of Melbourne Clip winner
Comedy King and of Yippingale, who
was a half-sister to Heroic’s dam,
Chersonese). At 3500 guineas Farhad
isn’t likely to prove the same bargain
that Romano got when he paid 2600
guineas for Bernborough, but should
pay his way.
Royal Lad did the pacemaking in
the 10-furlongs Lord Mayor’s Cup,
until W. Cook, on Piccolo, tried to
steal the race, shooting to the front
sharply at the half-mile. Piccolo had
most of them well beaten, but Kerry
Lad (G. Moore), with a 41b. advan-
tage in the weights, finished too
stoutly, winning by a half-length;
third was Royal Court, who should
pay expenses during her forthcoming
trip to the Armidale Cup meeting.
Both Kerry Lad and Piccolo are
New Zealanders; the winner a five-
year-old son of the leading N.Z. sire
Foxbridge, while Piccolo is a humor-
ously-named son of Inflation-Sweet
Music.
Scratchings were heavy at Rosehill,
the Two-year-old field being reduced
from a couple of dozen to 16. Com-
fortable winner of the event was the
High Caste colt Brighton (G. Moore),
downing the Ajax filly Salome and
Pax Vobis (a daughter of Agincourt
and that rattling good mare Amiable,
who held the Australian mile record
of 1.34-J until Shannon reduced the
time a fraction).
Mixed Stakes events comprised half
the programme. Three of them at
seven furlongs were won by Captivate
(A. Ward), Denali (E. Fordyce) and
Heroic Sovereign (J. Thompson).
Another, at 10 furlongs, went to
Chamhrs (W. Cook). The Ajax mare
Sonning (F. Walker) led throughout
to take the nine-furlongs Welter.
At Mentone punters did not seem
greatly impressed by the fact that
South Australian rider D. Graetz had
made the trip over specially to ride
Bannerette in Saturday’s Devonshire
Handicap (10f.); recently he won the
Port Adelaide Cup on F. J. Hend-
ricksen’s Solar Bear mare. For the
Devonshire, Bannerette started at 12
to 1, more than half the field being
. given preference in the betting, with
St. Fairy favorite.
Graetz allowed the mare to bowl
along in the ruck in the early stages
and began to urge her with
half a mile to go. Responding well,
Bannerette produced a sustained run
to overhaul Nawab, and had enough
m hand to withstand a challenge
from Spearmain. Very little between
those three on the post, but Banner-
ette had it. Weighted out of it with
9.9, St. Fairy finished a creditable
fourth —his best effort this time up.
High Play and Greensborough were
the most fancied pair for the six-
furlongs Ascot Thousand, but the
handicapper had them both taped;
they finished together behind the
placegetters. W. Shipton jumped the
Portofino gelding Hispano first out
from the barrier, eased him back
allowing Hawa Rani to set the pace,
and had too much kick for that horse
at the finish; Belle Star was third.
Hispano started at sixes, completing
a nice double for Shipton, who earlier
landed the Moodemere Handicap for
three-year-olds on the 25-to-l chance
Belmont, a Dhoti colt. Bold John’s
effort in finishing second ahead of
favorite Sun Lyric was worth noting.
Punters must have decided, with
some reason, that the F. W. Hoysted
stable is infallible when it comes to
two-year-old events. Either that or
else there was a huge splurge of
stable-money for the Hoysted-trained
Pindus, who went out favorite for
the five-furlongs Shrewsbury Handi-
cap. Whatever the inspiration, it
went astray, Pindus running only a
moderate race to finish sixth. The
event went to a 12-to-l chance in
Great Hero (W. A. Smith), just pip-
ping unlucky (or not quite good
enough) Star of Gold, with Idle
Dreamer third. Great Hero is of
interest in being one of the first
crop of that fine galloper Yaralla;
and his dam was Augustina, a 0
Heroic mare. The colt was pur-

If Shannon is ridden in his Ameri-
can races by Johnny Longden he’ll
be in capable hands. English-born,
son of a coalminer, Longden in 20
years in America has landed some
3000 winners.
Shannon and the American cham-
pion Armed, likely to meet in the
Santa Anita Handicap, have one
thing in common, and in common
also with many other good horses.
They both struck champion form at
a mature age after being lightly
raced in their youth. Shannon bene-
fited enormously from a long spell
enforced by an injury received in a
stand-up fight with another horse at
Rosehill. Armed did not race at all
as a two-year-old and very little at
three and four; mainly as a five- and
six-year-old he has won somewhere
round three-quarters of a million
dollars.

Rangachari, of the Indian tourers,
showed a marked liking for triplets
in the match against Tassy, played
at Hobart. First innings he brought
off a hat-trick; second innings,
bowled three and caught three. India
by an innings and 139 runs, having
closed its innings with 7 down for
406; Amarnath 171, Hazare 115.
Amarnath got going again in the
next clash with Tassy, at Launceston,
hitting up 135 to become first in
Australia this season to top the thou-
sand. Opener Sarwate also topped
the century (128). Innings closed at
7 for 457, and Tassy starting off all
right with 198 for 2 wickets; mostly
a good stand by opener Morrisby.
With Morrisby sticking there till
Amarnath bowled him at 130, and
then Walmsley knocking up a not-
out 180, Tassy passed the Indian
first-innings score by a run.
In such time as the wet permitted,
N.S.W. hit up 374 and 108 for 5
wickets (declared) and S.A. 263 and
129 for 6. Highest score, Niehuus’s
81. Toshack, who’s been troubled
by a dicky knee, didn’t get among
’em in the first innings, but bagged
three S.A. wickets for 36 in the
second. First-innings win to N.S.W.
“We'll just try this for size."
Niehuus’s 47 and Hamence’s 85
for S.A. and Carrigan’s 121 not out
for Q. were the bright spots of the
first-innings Shield play in Brisbane.
The three of them have shown con-
sistent form this season.
Bill Bowes has been handed £BOB3

Cricket Ground back in 1932.

France narrowly, 8-7, Howell scoring

to indicate that French Rugby Union

exceptionally well, but incline towards
“temperament.” Another victory—
over a French “B” team —was also
close, 11-9.

W. Sidwell had a well-deserved win
in the long-postponed final of the
Victorian singles tennis champion-

of the last eliminated. Now the
Australian championships are under
way at Kooyong (Melb.).

corded by an Australian —60.4 sec.

after a head clash with Roy Treasure

November, but-'Coleman was in better
trim for the return bout, and even
looked like winning for a while.
However, Wenman’s lefts did more

in the later rounds, and it was Wen-
man clearly on points.

United States Prospects
President Truman has said
that, with the right kind of long-
range planning, the United States
should be able to increase
national output by 35 p.c. during
the next 10 years. He coupled
this with a warning to Congress
that there was a grave danger
that soaring prices would stretch
credit too far, and that this,
combined with ill-judged indus-
trial development, would lead to
an economic recession,
Australia’s export industries
arc very much interested in con-
ditions in the U.S.A. Wool, lead
and wheat prices are at the
moment particularly susceptible
to American demand or produc-
tion. The Australian Stock Ex-
changes also have taken note of
the ups and downs of Wall-
street in the past, even so far as
our manufacturing and distri-
buting shares are concerned, but
the connection here is generally
less relevant. The most sensitive
link between U.S. economic
conditions and the Australian
Stock Exchange would prob-
ably be found attached to
Barrier silver-lead stocks and
Mt. Isa.
Some reasons for the big im-
ports of base metals by the
U.S.A. and the consequent high
world price were revealed in
President Truman’s annual eco-
nomic report to Congress. Pro-
duction in all industry during
1947 was about 7 p.c. above the
1946 level and 76 p.c. above the
1935-39 average. The slight
drop in agricultural output was
more than offset by production in
the manufacturing and building
trades, transport services and
public utilities. Employment
reached a record of 60 million
during the year, an increase of
10} million over 1940. Unem-
ployment was at “probably a
practical minimum.”
United States business invest-
ment and income reached record
proportions. Corporation earn-
ings, after taxation, were double
those of the war years and four
times those of 1929. It is in re-
spect of business earnings that
a vital difference is seen between
the U.S. and the Australian
economy ; in this country com-
pany earnings have not yet re-
covered to pre-war level, whereas
in America pre-war profits have
been multiplied. Each country
may have gone to an opposite
extreme, but in the Common-
wealth the low-profit policy has
reduced investment funds while
adding to the spending funds of
Governments and wage-earners,
and thus increasing the inflation
menace.
The United States exported
$ll,OOO million - worth more
goods and services than it im-
ported last year. It has not only
restored its pre-war productive
capacity but added to it, and it
has naturally been called on to
supply a war-disrupted Europe
with an unusual amount of food
and other supplies. But it is
plain that, as the rest of the
world recovers, the U.S.A. will
have to buy more in order to cut
down this annual growth in a
lopsided trade position that can
only result in international bank-
ruptcies and vexatious trade-
barriers as time goes by.
America, of course, will feel
reluctant to give .its surplus pro-
duction away, seeing that so
much of the democratic world
these days has developed a
“gimme” complex arising out of
Government experiments i n
socialism that have been per-
verted in every conceivable way
by Communist treachery. Gifts
to help the economic recovery
of other nations are only likely
to be successful when those
nations show a sturdy desire to
decline the gifts as soon as pos-“
sible.
The inflation problem in the
United States is a serious one,
just as it is here. Chairman
Marriner S. Eccles, of the
Federal Reserve Board, in
November gave Congress his
views as to how the battle
against high prices and living
costs should be conducted. He
said that “at best monetary and
credit policy can have only a
supplemental influence in any
effective treatment of either in-
flation or deflation.” He blamed
“war-financing and the enor-
mous Federal deficits as the
source of the present inflation,”
adding that “we are suffering
the consequences today of an
excessively swollen money-
supply which neither the bankers
individually nor Government
authorities have any means at
present of controlling.” The
economy was “caught in a
dangerous wage - price - profit -
credit spiral, acutely intensified
by short farm crops abroad and
reduced corn and cotton crops
at home.” Mr. Eccles called for
decreased Government spending,
with as big a Budget surplus as
possible, and a general anti-
inflationary fiscal policy. He
asked for stricter appraisals and
less liberal credit terms under
the Veterans Administration,
Federal Housing Administration
and Home Loan Bank pro-
grammes of housing finance.
He claimed that the easy terms
available on housing loans con-
stituted “possibly the most in-
“Well, so long. Thanks for everything !”
flationary factor in the present
situation.”
In Australia the core of our
inflationary problem is Budget
spending, too; but wrapped
round this core is inadequate
production from “Labor”
unionists. We have no 76 p.c. in-
crease in production compared
with pre-war years. And help to
returned soldiers and potential
home-owners is not so serious
an inflationary threat in this
country as are costly and poli-
tically-based “social services”
and an extravagant policy of
“full employment” that exists
in a payroll form only.
The Wheat Price
Canberra has increased the
price of home - consumption
wheat from ss. 2d. a bushel
bagged to 6s. 3d. bulk, f.o.r.
ports. This is estimated to
represent an increase of about
Is. 4d. in the home-consumption
price and Is. 3d. in the guaran-
teed price to growers. The new
figure is intended to apply to all
wheat sold by the Wheat Board
for human consumption or
stock-feed until the 1951-52
crop is marketed. If the export
price drops below 6s. 3d. a
bushel that minimum will still
be “guaranteed,” even if “the
stabilisation fund becomes ex-
hausted.”
The present increased return
to the grower, it is stated, will
be met out of the stabilisation
fund, and the rise in the
price of wheat will be met by
the consumer. In the past the
fund has been established by
the Government’s taking 50 p.c.
of the export price between
ss. 2d. bagged and 9s. 6d.
bagged. In future the levy will
be 50 p.c. of the price between
6s. 3d. bulk and 10s. 7d. bulk.
Net mean returns over 10s. 7d.
will go to the grower, export
wheat averaged with home-con-
sumption grain.
Stabilisation contributions al-
ready collected from the 1945-
46 year are to be distributed to
growers not later than Decem-
ber, 1948, in proportion to their
deliveries to the Wheat Board.
No further distributions are to
be made “except as Cabinet ap-
proves.” After distribution of
the 1945-46 collections, a rea-
sonable minimum for the fund
is reckoned at £2O million. Pro-
vision is made for a review of
the plans.
The whole scheme at present
is operating under the National
Security Regulations. Comple-
mentary State legislation will
have to be introduced to give
the Commonwealth power to
deal as intended with all har-
vests from the 1948-49 crop on-
ward. Hence, apparently, the
Federal “Labor” Government’s
decision to make concessions to
wheatgrowers at this stage,
some States having refused to
pass the necessary legislation
last year. Canberra, too, is less
reluctant to pass on living-cost
increases than it was. Bread
rises a ha’penny a loaf as a re-
sult of the new wheat price.
Canada, which saw the end
of the war with a price-level
19.2 p.c, above that prevailing
at June 30, 1939, has allowed it
to move up to around 40 p.c.
above, influenced in this to some
extent by the United States
economy. Australia showed a
war-time growth of about 24
p.c. in living costs ; there has been
a rise to 30 p.c. since. But real
costs of production have risen
much more than indicated by
Canberra statistics, and so have
living expenses. The “Labor”
Government’s contention that
Australia has the world’s lowest
cost of living is in many respects
a fiction, and a dangerous one.
Commonwealth productive
capacity has not expanded at
nearly the same rate as Canada’s
since 1939, but its volume of
money has grown by almost the
same percentage.

The Development of Life Assurance in Australia
The first Australian Life Assurance society was founded
in 1849 and; like most Australian offices, it was, and
still is, a mutual concern which returns profits to
policy holders. Since the turn of the century, life
assurance has flourished mightily, the sums assured
having grown from £103,000,000 at the turn of the
century to £833,000,000 today, while the number of
policies issued has increased from 800,000 to over
5,100,000. Large assets are therefore necessary to fulfil
the obligations of life assurance to policy holders.
The funds of Life Assurance Offices arefor the protection of
policy holders , and are used for the benefit of the community.

The Problem of Prices
Of the many uncertain things
in the world at present, the
future of prices must rank just
about No. 1 in public concern
in the United States, Australia,
New Zealand and Canada ; in
Britain the prices question is
overshadowed by the anxiety
about actual supplies of living
requirements—though here again
prices within the dollar area and
in South America are of great
importance.
In Australia and the United
States living essentials are not
really short, but they are rising
in price. Houses and motor-
cars are still scarce—and are ex-
pensive—in both countries.
Prices and production repre-
sent the greatest economic and
political problem of the day, and
they are the obvious manifesta-
tions of trouble on the indus-
trial front, war damage in
Europe and southern Asia, and
the excess of currency issued
during thb war, when the physi-
cal tax of war’s cost was not
properly represented in money
taxes, and when Labor did not
always do its duty.
Most countries have en-
deavored to keep prices down by
price- and/or profits-control, by
subsidies and other concessions.
In the United States price-control
(other than rent-control) was
abandoned more than a year
ago in the hope that output
would be stimulated ; but results
since have not been as success-
ful as hoped. Though produc-
tion of many essential things
has risen steeply (steel, auto-
mobiles and clothing especi-
ally), food, after exports, is still
in comparatively short supply,
and the high cost of foodstuffs
remains a major factor in the
inflating American cost of living.
But price-control has not been
reintroduced in the United
States. Instead, Congress,
against President Truman’s
wishes (he was in favor of modi-
fied price-control), has approved
restriction of exports and con-
trol of the use of transport
systems, voluntary allocation of
industrial materials to the most
socially desirable purposes, and
the curbing of credit-expansion
through the powers possessed by
the Federal Reserve Bank.
The peoples of the world, the
United States included, are still
undersupplied with the things for
which they have the money to
pay. In some cases the country
concerned finds its money un-
acceptable outside its own
borders, and in such cases the
money is usually very depreci-
ated even for internal buying.
France and some other Con-
tinental countries are having
severe currency trouble ; Britain
has it badly enough when it
wants to buy dollar goods, but
it is keeping the home price-
level fairly well under control.
The shortage of dollars avail-
able to nations recovering
from war damage and disrup-
tion is a factor in slowing-down
their recovery, since they may
be in need of essential machinery
and raw materials only obtain-
able from the United States.
International currency and poli-
tical problems are thus another
factor in the answer that may
be got from each country’s pro-
duction-price equation.
The United States, for its
part, is not sure that.any help
it may offer a country will be
put to the best rehabilitation
use.. Some countries are still
playing with political theories
instead of getting down to real
production problems. Some are
being deliberately sabotaged by
Soviet influences.
Among the democracies there
have been Governmental efforts,
through price - control, etc.,
to cushion the wage-earner from
the full effects of war-time and
post-war inflation. But often
the Governments concerned have
not been so willing to attempt
to remove the causes of infla-
tion. And the “protected” wage-
earners have not always been
ready to appreciate the fact that
price-control can only be a
temporary measure at best, and
that the real answer to the
danger rests mainly in their own
hands —that is, greater produc-
tion per man-hour is demanded
of them.
Instead of taking the realistic
attitude, Australian trade-union-
ism as a whole has pressed for
higher wages and fewer work-
ing hours per week, while job-
control is rampant in most
unions, and incentive-payments
have been forbidden by the
trade-union hierarchy. Lawless-
ness in the trade-union world
has been condoned by the Can-
berra “Labor” Government for
many years past, and it reveals
utter helplessness in the country’s
present difficulty.
It may be that the time has
come to let unruly and short-
sightedly selfish unionists stew
in their own juice—in the costs-
inflation of their own making.
They have been warned —many
times —but not by the sophists
who claim to be their political
or trade-union leaders.
Mr. Chifley said last week that
he was going to review the pre-
sent system of taxing private
companies, but would not be
dealing with compahy taxation
generally. Private companies
pay the flat-rate company tax,
plus undistributed-profits tax
equal to the tax which would
have been payable by share-
holders had that portion of the
profits been distributed. The
method has its advantages as
well as disadvantages for the
taxpayer ; but private companies
have had no relief from war-
time taxes similar' to the aboli-
tion of War-time (Company)
Tax in the case of public cos.,
There are fears in some quarters
that there will be no relief from
the proposed Chifley review,
and that the benefit of being
allowed taxes paid as a deduc-
tion will be discontinued in the ,
case of private cos.

Commonwealth and State
taxation, as officially estimated,
does not include local-govern-

Coal purchases! from the other
side of the globe are crippling
New Zealand railway finances.
Recent increases of 15 p.c. in
fares and 20 p.c. in freights have
been more than swallowed up in
soaring operating costs as State
railway spending rises by nearly
£4 for every £1 rise in revenue
on figures for the financial year
to date. The loss is already well
above a million, with four
months’ returns still to come.
Maoriland couldn’t make its rail-
ways pay in the days when it
bought coal from New South
Wales mines at prices only a
fraction of the £7 10s. (includ-
ing freight, £3 155.) a ton it’s
paying for a shipment from the
U.K. So M.L. taxpayers will
have to dip deeper than ever
into their pockets. In the past
year N.Z. has been stoking loco-
motives partly with dollar coal
(nearly 100,000 tons purchased
since the war’s end), but the dol-
lar famine has closed that door.
If John Bull can’t meet needs
M.L. might turn to South Africa,
or India, or anywhere else where
coal can be bought, regardless
of price. The need might be
met some day from its own
mines, but no one knows when.
Meanwhile the key weakness is
that sulphurous M.L. coal isn’t
the type the railways most need.
If output could be lifted from
the present 2,800,000 tons an-
nually to 4,000,000 tons there
would still be a lack of railway
and gas coal. Hydro-electric
power would be a solution if
the islands had enough of it, but
there, too, is a bottleneck that
will continue for years.
*** * .
As the other fellow sees it ;
from the American Wool Coun-
cil:—
British Dominion wools, which are
our chief source of supply, are all
handled by a joint British-Dominion
cartel and sold with a floor-price
limitation under which they are with-
drawn if bids do not exceed a given
price limit. American manufacturers
and dealers are therefore helpless to
control wool prices. They must bid
against the woollen mills of the
world, who are desperate for «raw
materials which will enable them to
compete in world markets for dollars
or their equivalent—and the principal
world market is the United States.
In pre-war years the U.S. was the
second-largest fine-wool grower in
the world, producing more than two-
thirds of the country’s wool require-
ments, thus retaining a price-control
which prevented abnormal increases
in world prices for specially wanted
grades and types of wool. Under
war - time pressure of lower r cost
foreign-wool imports, our production
has declined more than 40 p.c., while
consumption has increased 70 p.c.,
forcing this country to depend on
foreign wools, chiefly from the British
Dominions, 16,000 to 28,000 miles the
round trip away, for nearly 80 p.c. of
its requirements.
Still, to complete the story, some
mention should have been made
of the U.S. tariff ruling
up to the end of 1947.

Auckland’s new £500,000 gas-
making plant, designed to stave
off the growing competition by
electricity and put Auckland
abreast of leading world enter-
prises in the gas field, is not yet
operating. V. J. Lamer pre-
dicted ten months ago that gas
would flow from at least a por-
tion of the new plant in 1947 ;
he barred “unforeseen difficul-
ties,” and of these there have
been plenty. Now mid-1948
seems the earliest likely date for
the big change. Strikes and un-
rest in Australia and shipping
bottlenecks have held up de-
liveries of structural steel, and
plant from England is late.

rock-cakes must have known someone
like Mrs. Tom Naylor. They were the
only kind she ever turned out, for no
matter what recipe she started on the re-
sult was always something compared with
which granite was as sponge. Once when
we were playing Coolawallop and had
them all out for 28 I was reckless enough
to praise the sinister gibbers Mrs. Tom
was handing round at afternoon tea: a
bad error, for next day a large bag of
the things arrived at the hut. Main prob-
lem was where to hide them not only
from the grey possum with whom I
shared the humpy—l liked that possum
—but from the young Naylors, who
swarmed over my premises whether I was
home or not. I couldn’t bury them, for
if they were interred in the fallow they
would last indefinitely and eventually old
Tom would plough them up ; and if they
were sunk in the sheep-paddocks his dogs
would find the disturbed earth and, re-
covering the imperishable nuggets, take
them home again. Nor could I burn
them ; the whole district knew the smell
of Mrs. N.’s cakes burning. Nervous
strain finally decided me to go
down to the Show, and, waiting
till everyone else in the carriage was
asleep, I hurled them far into the night
whilst crossing a ring-barked ridge some-
where between Yass and Goulburn,
where there was a good chance that ero-
sion would get to work on the horrible
things before some wandering fossicker
found them and announced his discovery,
hopefully, as possibly uranium ore.

“Uramao”: Henare had been given the
job of cleaning out birds’-nests between
the roof and ceiling of a big, rambling
old home. He got his gear up through
the trapdoor, and for an hour or so he
was heard moving slowly around. Fol-
lowed about half an hour of thumping
about as if he had a horse up, and in
desperation the lady of the house at last
mounted the ladder and called out to see
if there was anything wrong. There was
—Henare was “bushed”! Eventually he
was guided back along the dim valleys,
and over the desolate plains by the aid of
a clothes-prop tapped on the ceiling.

“Bo”: Creswell’s champion Tamworth
sow had disappeared, and the household
could remember no such comparable con-
sternation since Grandpa Creswell had re-
turned from a city visit in a bowler hat
and minus his luxurious ziff and been
bailed up by the dogs. After two days
of fruitless search word was received from
the mailman that he had heard pig-grunts
coming from the direction of Danny the
Hatter’s shack off the Junction road.
Creswell and his eldest son almost singed
the intervening bracken with the speed of
their foray into Danny’s domains. In a
bough lean-to by the shack touching re-
union was made with the beloved Bridget;
then Creswell, senr., wrathfully descended
upon Danny, who was unconcernedly
feeding scraps to his pet goahna. After
suitable recriminations and threats to
“have the Law on him” Creswell, struck
by a thought, said “Anyway, what the hell
made y’ take her? You couldn’t sell her
in the district, y’ can’t milk a pig, an’
y’ haven’t cut her up for pork an’ bacon
—what did y’ want her for?” Old Danny
screwed .up his faded eyes. “Well,” he
said calmly, “just take a gink at me dawg,
will y’? Never see such a scrawny coot,
an’ no matter how much I feed me go.
y’ can still see his ribs stickin’ out —and
they’re both such restless cows, too. I
wanted someone I could mag to fer a
change that was fat, happy an’ contented.”

“Old-timer”: One dry year Little Curl
and Pocket-knife were camped on Gilal-
bee tank, keeping the sheep out of the
boggy blue mud and watering them
through a netting lane that led to a log-
platform in the mud. It was necessary
for them to sleep on the tank to keep
the sheep and ’roos off by night, and
things went along all right until Little
Curl discovered that Pocket-knife had
taken to walking in his sleep and thrice
in four nights had to haul him out of
the bog. Deciding that strategy was
called for. Little Curl joined a couple of
halters together, waited until his mate
dropped off, then slipped a loop around
an ankle and tied the other end to a
hefty stump. A couple of hours later a
small mob of wethers drifted in and Curl
arose and rushed at them shouting.
Pocket-knife awoke and rushed, too, and
was promptly upended by one foot and
smacked the tank bank with his face.
Little Curl listened to the language that
blistered the hot darkness, then he crept
thoughtfully off into the scrub and waited
for the dawn.

, “Hanko”: In all my considerable
ramblings never yet have I seen a wedge-
tailed eagle making a meal. Strange, too,
when you almost always find kestrels.
“Well have to get the safety-valve fixed when We get back to the shed.”
falcons, brown and harrier hawks either
dining or going full lick after some
mobile tucker. I once kept an eagle’s
nest, filled with big lumps of fledglings,
under observation all one Sunday after-
noon, and although the old birds paid
sporadic visits to the nursery, never once
did they carry in food. Circling grace-
fully in the blue seems to occupy most
of the eagle’s wakeful hours, but what
the big chook subsists on has me beat—
all the dead-’uns I’ve handled have had
the scrawny bodies of starved game
roosters. As for being a lamb-taker, I
won’t have it. It’s my belief that the
wedgie is afraid of sheep, as it is afraid
of quite a lot of things—despite its
viciously hooked beak and the wild glint
in its eye, the eagle is as yellow as a ripe
banana. An irritable Willie Wagtail
would scare the tripe out of it.

“Blime”: It was one of an extended
series of days round the hundred mark,
and we had no sooner discovered the loss
of the waterbag than Paddy developed
an enormous thirst. He mentioned it
monotonously throughout the morn-
ing, inquiring how much further it was
to Brumby Creek, but when we rode that
way about noon we found nothing but
dry sand and boulders. Thereafter we
joined the chorus of Paddy’s lament. All
afternoon we stuck to the job, but near-
ing the home paddock about sundown
there was a mad scramble for the river.
Paddy made for the big swimming pool
below the willows, while Ted and I cut
round the bend upstream. “Don’t drink
the hot water on top,” Ted yelled at us.
“It’ll make y’ sick. Shove your heads
well down where she’s cool.” He was
right. The water below was cool
enough, and after some delicious gulping
I came up for a hasty breather and went
down in another nose-dive. Later
I remembered Paddy. “Gripes, Ted,”
I gasped, “it’s all right for us
drinking down under, but with a thirst
like he’s got I bet he won’t want to stop
drinking and” Ted’s jaw dropped
slowly ; then, with impromptu suggestions
on resuscitation, we dashed round the
bend. Came a collision as Ted stopped.
There, with his head turned upstream,
Paddy lay face-down in the mud of the
river-bed still gulping manfully. The big
swimming-hole was empty.

“Camsa”; The Croweaters are claim-
ing another record. A Burra farmer
startled a hare out of the long grass on
the Booborowie-road. It ran in front of
his car for 10 miles, during which the
speedo needle hovered from 25 to 30
m.p.h. Then the # hare began to stagger
from one side of the road to the other

“Betcha”: Sammy hadn’t been work-
ing at the store long before he woke up
to it that the boss was a very fair-minded
sort. He distributed the short-sup-
plied goods as evenly as he could among
his customers, never keeping any back
for his friends nor promising anything he
couldn’t deliver. Then, after a very long
time without such a luxury a case of
tinned fish arrived. The boss checked
the invoice, eyed the limited number of
tins, then, making out an equivalent list
of customers, presented it to Sam with
instructions to supply them with a tin if
they so wished. Sticking conscientiously
to the list, Sam was surprised to hear the
boss taking orders from other customers
for fish to be delivered a week later. “Ex-
pecting another case in next week, are
you?” he inquired as the boss took down
still another order. “Gripes, no,” came
the reply. “We won’t see any more for
a good while, I bet. But as soon as the
coves, that’s got ’em see their price
dockets they’ll be sendin’ them tins o’
fish back again right away.”

“Bluenose”: You can find a practical
example of “F.WJ.’s” explanation of
tidal vagaries (B. 10/12/’47) at Thursday
Island Complicated by the shape of
Torres Strait and its many shoals and
reefs, the ebb and flow is further thrown
out of gear by the fact that T.I. is a
small bit of land surrounded by the far
larger islands of Horn, Prince of Wales,
Hammond, etc. Through the channels
in this group the currents run in a way
which defies all attempts at prediction.
When I was at T.I. the swimming-
baths would sometimes remain full
for hours. The water-level would
drop and you would think that the
tide was ebbing; half an hour later it
would be full again. At other times it
would be no more than a puddle all day.
Wishing to get some idea of when to go
down for a swim with a chance of find-
ing water at least up to your knees, I
called on the Navy. “We had a chap up
here for six months at one time,” I was
told. “The poor devil was trying to work
out a set of tide-tables for T.I. They say
he went cuckoo at the finish.” Finally
I worked out a system of my own. If
from the window of my billet I could
just see the tip of the mast of an anchored
lugger over the roof of a store I would
go down for a swim. If it couldn’t be
seen I would take, a bucket of water from
the tank and have a sluice in the yard.

“Salmon Gums”; I opened the airtight
tin in which the flour was stored, and the
weevils climbed towards the opening and
started a train of thought. How did they
get there? Apparently they, or at least
the original couple, sprang from eggs
which survived the ordeal of milling and
sifting, to hatch out in the flour. That
is, at least, reasonable. But I recall a
bottle of spirits which, corked and tightly-
sealed, was found, after years on the
shelf, to contain a small fly. Known as
the spirit fly, it is not uncommonly found
in hotel cellars, in bottles to which it
could not possibly have been introduced
after sealing. Most people are familiar
with the vinegar-plant, that peculiar
growth which appears in vinegar to baffle
the housewife. I have removed toass
which were embedded in rock-like sub-
stance feet below the surface, and I know
of at least one case where one was dis-
covered, alive, in rock taken from a Kal-
goorlie mine. Within the limits of this
planet and its atmosphere, there seem to
be few localities or conditions incapable
of harboring life. I marvel whenever, as
sometimes occurs, a heavy rain produces
a swarm of those miniature black frogs.
None of the explanations I’ve heard—that
the spawn was carried heavenwards in a
waterspout and hatched out in the air,
or that the little beggars were lurking
below the surface and took the oppor-
tunity to emerge—fills the bill. From
the tadpole stage, frogs take six months
to develop the first pair of legs, so over-
night-hatching is ruled out. No, I haven’t
any alternative theory.

“Jaybee”: Tell “C.Q.” (B. 10/12/’47)
that Victoria, known or unknown, does
not include Rodondo Island. The Vic-
torian-Tasmanian boundary lies along lat.
39deg. lOmin., and Rodondo, though only
six miles off Wilson’s Promontory, is the
first bit of Tasmania sighted by the air-
traveller from Victoria on his way south.
Though so close to Victoria, Rodondo
isn’t the most northerly of the Speck’s
specklets. Fifteen miles east of Rodondo
and a mile or so further north lies the
Hogan group, consisting of Hogan
Island and a couple of diminutive satel-
lites. Incidentally, does anyone know if
the original Hogan really landed pigs
there and if there are any surviving
descendants?

“Eastern”: Old Bill mooched in, called
for, a beer and nodded wryly as Bung ex-
plained there was nothing left but lemon-
ade. “Just been t’ the store,” Bill told
the crowd gloomily. “Can’t get the
machine parts I want, can’t buy a decent
bit, can’t get a gate or a coil o’ wire,
an’ can’t get hold o’ nicotine sulphate

charged soldier draped mournfully on the
end of the bar. “Hey, Dig,” he called

“Kelms”: Agree with “Sou’-west”
(B. 24/12/’47) that the greyhound-deer-
hound cross produces the kangaroo-dog,
and I know that the cross is popularly
regarded as the only dog for the job. But
I still hold that the purebred greyhound
is a faster and, if well-trained, a surer
beast; and I still prefer my description
of it as “a handful of bone and muscle.”
The ’roo-dog is a powerful beast, usually
fast and often game, but crossbreeding
carries an element of unreliability, which
is why you’ll sometimes find a dog speedy
enough to overtake a ’roo and massive
enough to pull it down, but lacking the
courage to attack. That fault never
occurs in the greyhound. The trouble
is that the ’roo-dog, living on its reputa-
tion and its name, has ousted the smaller
breed from favor, and few hunters will
trouble to train the greyhound. The Too-
dog, of course, is more powerful; but it
is science that counts in a throw. A
’roo can be thrown easily by a dog that
knows its job and is game to tackle it in
flight. Then a quick snap crushes skull
and brain. The fiercest dog I ever owned
was a little blue greyhound bitch. She
hated the presence of other dogs in the
chase, scorned assistance in the kill, and,
outside of office hours, reigned as queen
in a camp which contained many a’roo-
dog big enough to eat her. If “Sou-
west,” or anyone but her owner, had
ventured to touch her kill she wouldn’t
have pulled him down —she’d have thrown
him and crushed his skull.

Between broad billows of trees, with a plaintive

Down murmurs of leaves and the lisp of secret

Among obeisant grasses. This singing green

And gathers to a reservoir of sighs.
No sacrilegious rasp of the city’s voice
Intrudes upon this holy whisper of ground;
Only a church-bell ringing from its sanctuary
Disturbs the sibilant interlude and motions
The old man indoors with his dreams. He
leaves
The hour to me, not knowing that he takes
The essence of its perfection in his eyes of

His silver beard, and grey solemnity.

Sailors their stretdi of seas...where the green

“Plop”: Like others of the breed,
Harry’s bulldog, Brutus, had a marvellous
range of appetites, gulping at anything
from curried eggs to watermelon. His
special dish was ice-cream, and whenever
Harry walked him past the Greek’s the
dog would pull up, refusing to budge until
he had downed a threepenny cone. Wise
to all lurks, Brutus took to turning up
at the fizz-dispensary on his own, hope-
fully licking his chops until old Mottee
passed him down a vanilla and ticked it
up. Harry would settle at the
end of the month, and Brutus happily
grew obese. The system broke down
when Harry, hurriedly summoned
by phone to the shop, found a loud-tied
bloke from the city bailed up, terrified,
on the top of a table. Harry learned that
he had reached the strawberry juice in a
“Sundae Special” when Brutus rolled in
and took a pew with his eyes gleaming
and mouth watering by the side of the
table. Fearful that his trousered calf
and not Mottee’s supreme creation
was the dog’s desire, the bloke was still
going like a jelly on springs when the
saddened Brutus was hauled away.

“B. A. Ker”; Foresight is not generally
a conspicuous factor in our domestic
affairs, but we planned well ahead for
the 1947 Christmas. By careful calcula-
tion we reached agreement on the right
time to buy the ducklings so that they
would be old enough to be meaty, not
old enough to be tough and not at that
between-age when there are a myriad of
feather-stubs to be extracted one by one.
A fortnight before Christmas the human
element crept in: the cheers-and-hisses
decided that she couldn’t possibly eat one
of the littlej brood without feeling like a
cannibal. So my annual pilgrimage be-
gan once more. No poultry-farmer had
young roosters for sale. Old hens were
procurable— at a price. Finally I drove
a hard bargain and bought a middle-
aged, matronly-figured Orpington. She
laid in the sugar-bag on the way home.
Next day she laid again. And again the
next day. It was enough. We got a piece
of pork for Christmas dinner. Over the
New Year her fate swung in the balance
again—and was weighed down by two
eggs delivered at the critical stage. She

“Foulis”: “We were'playin’ Possum
Flat,” said Dagsy. “They bat first and

start with, so have to play on with one.
Then blime, just six short of their score,
Bob goes for a sixer, busts that bat an’
gets caught. Our skipper says he sup-
poses it’s a draw. I’m last man in, an’

that. First ball is on the leg, an’ I con-

ning, and keep on runnin’ as the Possum
Flat fellers tear around lookin’ for it.

the Possum Flat skipper with an ugly
look comes up and says, ‘Wot’s that on

looks, and there’s the ball spiked to the

started—l got donged right there.”

“Orona”: Let me in on this rabbits-
fading-out theory when taken to islands
off the mainland. Looking for Jap hide-
outs in the Central Pacific, our little
minesweeper called in at Phoenix Island,
in the Phoenix group, aptly described by
the chief engineer as a wart on the ocean,
its vegetation scant scrub, mostly pig-
weed and its only inhabitants sea-birds
and rabbits. The bunnies were small, a
mixture of black and white. On attempts
being made to catch them they took re-
fuge under the wings of the sea-birds,
with whom they were on the friendliest
terms.

“Billy See”; While I am glad to have
“Old-timer’s” testimony regarding the
benevolence of those serpents that res-
cued little Billy from the underground
well (B. 10/12/’47), I don’t think their
intelligence surpassed that of a pet snake
owned by a Texan serviceman. Brought
to Perth as a mascot during the Ameri-
can invasion, Rattles was left alone in
the serviceman’s flat while its owner
attended one of the theij hot parties in
Mount-street. Towards a.m, residents in
the vicinity of the flat were aroused by
what they at first took to be the noise of
a kid’s clatter gadget, one of those imi-
tation crow-scarers. Rung by phone, a
constable hurried to the scene to find that
the Yank’s flat had been entered by a
cat burglar: and there was the faithful
Rattles holding the intruder in custody
while, with its tail stuck out of a win-
dow, it rattled for the police.

“Barrabooni”; Most people regard the
seal as a creature which spends file greater
part of its life in the water in pursuit of
fish. Actually it can usually obtain all
the food it needs in about half an hour;
the rest of its swimming is done merely
in play or in travelling from one island or
reef to another. A sun-warmed rock is a
favorite retreat. In winter, its fishing
done, the seal will climb up to 300 ft. to
reach a place sheltered from cold rain ;
sometimes thickets of ti-tree and other
scrub are favored. When travelling over-
land seals walk on their flippers in the
same way as other animals use their legs;
only when disturbed and frightened do
they use an ungainly hopping combined
with sliding to reach the sanctuary of
the water. Another queer thing about the
seal is the fact that the pups do not swim
instinctively, as do dogs and ducks; the
cow has to hunt her baby into the water
and force it to remain there, even if it
j s browned in the process until it

“Gravelsnatcher”: There came to
Bumpercrop one day a man with a
cheque, a wonderful thirst and an awful
impediment in his speech. This was not a
noticeable obstacle to social intercourse
while he had something to speak for
him; but when his assets had been
“Have yer noticed anything strange about Lofty lately?”
liquidated he had great difficulty
in informing the publican that he ex-
pected a generous handout and a couple
for the road. Bung had less trouble
in assuring him that his credit had
ceased to exist. That evening the
long tables at the hotel were pre-
pared for a party which was about to
commence when the deadbeat entered
with a cattle-dog. Working quickly, he
took a piece of rope, one end of which
was attached to the dog’s tail, and tied
it to the corner of the tablecloth. Then,
warning the guests with an explosive
“D-d-cf-d-doan’ move” that rendered them
immobile, he addressed the publican,
slowly and painfully repeating his former
demand. But the publican moved
quickly and commenced to untie the
knot. “He-he-he-he-he” the deadbeat
chanted desperately while Bung swore
and fumbled, “He-he-he”— — He
stopped, swallowed, stamped his feet and
took a grip on himself. Then “Heel
’em, pup!” he commanded firmly, and
the dog took off, leaving the rope and
a tuft of his tail in Bung’s hand. While
strong men cursed and women shrieked
the deadbeat spat disgustedly. “Y’ c’n
keep y’r feed,” he said and walked out
completely cured.

“Solitude”: Seventyfiver paused to look
at the steep grade of Fainting Range.
“Used t’ cart our goods up that spur one
time in a dray,” he announced dreamily.
“Weren’t no road in them days, o’ course.
Had t’ pick a track between the trees
an’ stumps.” “Some job,” I murmured,
taking in the range. “Aw, it was no
trouble,” scoffed the old bloke. “ ’Course
they wouldn’t do it now. Too hard f’r
’em. Rather sit back an’ let a lot o’ high-
smellin’ machines do their work.” He
pointed to a steep pinch near the top.
“See that stretch?” he continued. “Used
t’ shove a chock agen the wheels an’ give
the nag a blow there. An’ we’d mostly
take hold an’ lend a hand then, t’ the
top. Weren’t frightened of good honest
toil. But, cripes, nob’dy’d think o’ such
things now. Not that it’d hurt any of
’em.” “Well, I’m glad it was no trouble,”
I cut in, “because the cattle on that run
need salt, and the old man reckons the
truck’s not pulling. We might have to
cart the stuff over this side.” Seventy-
fiver dropped his pipe without noticing
the loss. “What, you an’ me? ’Struth,
Sol, it don’t make sense,” he snorted,
setting himself for an argument. “Does
he think we’re goin’t’ cart salt over this
way when he’s got a flamin’ big truck
in the shed doin’ nothin’?”

“M.U.R.”: A minor controversy as to
the origin of “hatter” broke out in Mel-
bourne at the turn of the old year, but so
far as I could gather it was a no-decision
bout. An “Age” writer suggested that
the name was given to lonely shepherds
in the old days, their isolation allegedly
making them as “mad as hatters.” I in-
cline to the view that “mad as a hatter”
sprang from Lewis Carroll, but as Alice
wasn’t published until about 1870, it
could hardly be the origin of the Aus-
tralian term. Somebody else said it was
the name given to solitary prospectors
who were given to “working hatters,”
though what the deuce that means beats
me. When I first discovered the Murray
every old waler and bend-dweller living
alone was called a hatter, and we youths
supposed that it came from Lake Hattah,
where one particular specimen of the
tribe ran an illegal swivel-gun on a punt
and kept the Melbourne market supplied
with wild duck and himself with beer for
his breakfast porridge. For what it’s
worth my theory is that the lonely old
shack-dwellers talked to their hats in
much the same way as swagmen were
alleged to talk to their swags. More
than once, between Tapalin and Euston,
I’ve run across old Jimmy the Boiler,
bare-headed and waving an admonitory
finger at his hat, which sat upon a post
and heard with bland indifference
James’s opinion of the Guvmint.

“Dronestung”: A report from U.S.
Agriculture Department is brightly opti-
mistic regarding the future traits of bees
from artificially-raised queens. Latest
scientific discovery is that virgin queens
will commence laying after being
anaesthetised with carbon dioxide, though
all eggs will produce drones. One of
these may then be mated with the: still-
virgin queen, and the worker offspring
will be gentle, hard r working and less in-
clined to disease. It sounds woolly
theorising to me. Virgin queens mate a
few days after hatching and begin laying
soon after. If unmated they will, after
some delay, produce only drone eggs for
the rest of their lives. About five weeks
elapse with drones from the egg to readi-
ness for mating, by which time a queen’s
fate is firmly sealed —she mates only once
in a lifetime. Mating occurs on the
wing, beyond the control of human
agency. By isolating hives for mating it
is possible to keep the strains pure, assur-
ing that only pure-bred drones are avail-
able, But even drones of one colony
vary in physical development and trans-
mitted traits, so that only the most care-
fully-selected drones would sire the per-

“Hanko”: It was hot and dusty in the
saleyards, so while they were yarding a
new lot we adjourned to the Shearers’
Arms. Slumped on a form in the bar
was a thick-set, tow-headed bloke, his
shirt open at the front exposing a red-
and-blue dragon on his chest. “Well, if
it ain’t old Popeye,” snickered Lofty,
“and six hundred miles from the big
wet.” We’d forgotten the sailorman, and
were discussing the sales when Suddenly
he erupted among us. “Sheeps,” he
shouted. “All youse can speak is sheeps.”
His eyes glazed momentarily; a look of
complete bewilderment came over him,
then his eyes fired again. “Und vot der
youse know about sheeps?” he roared.
“Yen all youse effer seen is a paddle-
vheeler ill a bletty river.” We gulped our
drinks and hurried back to the yards.
* * * *
“Canine,” delousing some dog-poisons;
In the bush, Towser always runs the risk of
finding and eating a strychnine-poisoned rabbit;
the town dog more commonly strikes a snag
in chewing a rat whose hash had been settled
by phosphorus. When poisoned by strychnine
the dog will stiffen and his eyes appear to
stare; next it falls on its side, throws its head
back and suffers a fit which quickly passes.
To test whether the hound is not suffering a fit
from say, distemper, wait until he lies quietly
and give him a sudden tap on the shoulder —
if it is strychnine another spasm will imme-
diately follow. In severe cases it may be
necessary to use artificial respiration to keep
the dog breathing, but this and other treatment
must be done gently to avoid excitement, which
might be fatal. With no emetic drugs available
a good emergency brew is four teaspoons of
common salt and half a teaspoon of mustard
dissolved in a cup of warm water, taking
care that it “goes down the right way.”
Phosphorus-poisoning can usually be recog-
nised by the strong onion-like odor in the
dog’s breath and should be treated with
a little Condy’s crystals or copper sulphate
(bluestone) in warm water. Never give him
milk or oil, as they help the phosphorus to be
absorbed. Harder to track down, other poisons,
such as acids, can be treated with egg-white,
limewater or flour; alkalis like caustic soda are
treated with weak vinegar; and lead compounds
with Epsom salts.
BELLBIRDS.
They’re ringing in each tree;
Hark to the bellbird’s notes,
That tinkling melody
From little feathered throats!
Silver bells, copper bells,
How the chorus swells,
Oh, how the music floats!
Hark! how they’re ringing,
Little ding, ding, dongs;
Fluttering and swinging,
Beating little gongs.
They’re chiming by the stream,
Up in the saplings tall:
Like rain that drops in dream
The notes of music fall:
Silver bells, copper bells
Casting fairy spells,
There where the waters call;
Hear how they’re chiming,
Little dong, dong, dings;
So sweet the echoes climbing,
It seems the whole world rings.
VICTORIA.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY. I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
Feeding and Overfeeding.
“Dungaree”; More lambs are
lost in Australia through faulty
feeding than from any other
cause—many ewes fail to breed
because they are too fat, but
greatest losses occur through
lack of feed, particularly when
the ewe is carrying the lamb.
Everyone knows that a motor-
car won’t go without petrol, but
too many sheepowners believe
that a sheep can go without feed.
True, they can keep going for
quite a time in bare paddocks,
but they are only living on the
fat and energy stored when
feed was plentiful, are losing
body weight all the time and
are not producing wool or off-
spring.
The ability of a sheep to pro-
duce wool, milk and to increase
its body-weight depends entirely
on the amount of feed it gets.
And the kind of feed it gets has
a direct bearing on the quantity
and quality of reproduction.
For instance, if a sheep is given
21b. of poor-quality hay per day
it may get along in a sort of a
way, but if it is given £lb. of
maize or a ration containing 2oz.
of meatmeal or bloodmeal it
will produce far more wool than
on the hay diet.
The old saying that half the
breeding goes down the throat
has been corrected by animal-
nutrition experts to very con-
siderably more than half. In
many parts of Australia ewes
are joined at times when experi-'
ence has proved that highest
lambing percentages result and
matings are arranged as early in
that cycle as possible. But it
frequently happens that, as a
result, lambings take place at a
time when feed is scarcest and
of poorest quality. A very high
percentage of lambs is dropped
in July-August, when natural
growth of grass is at a stand-
still and the quality of the re-
maining feed is very poor. The
ewe is expected to fend for her-
self and to rear a Iamb and pro-
vide milk under the most adverse
conditions. It is little wonder
that losses owing to pregnancy
toxaemia occur and that there is
a big difference between the
numbers of lambs dropped and
the numbers marked.
A sheep’s requirements of
feed depends largely on its body-
weight. Thus a 1001b. animal
should require twice as much as
a 501b. one. While there is
plenty of green feed about and
pastures are not overstocked the
sheep may be expected to do
well, provided it is kept free
from worms and other troubles.
But if a ewe requires 21b. of
nutritious natural pasture per
day to keep her production level,
she will need more than twice
this amount while she is carrying
a lamb, particularly in the last
six or seven weeks. Following
lambing she will require twice
the. pre-natal amount to maintain
her milk-flow and her own con-
dition.
In addition the food must be
up to a certain protein standard
to maintain wool-growth.
Naturally, a feeding programme
for ewes lambing during winter
will depend largely on the kind
of feed available and its cost;
but expert advice on a complete
balanced ration is readily avail-
able through Departments of
Agriculture. While it is now
largely understood that lambing
ewes need additional rations,
very few sheepowners realise the
extent of that additional feeding
if the ewe’s requirements are to
be completely satisfied.
“ Don't splash the Water about. Remember me and
Strawb.'s got to have one after you."
Colt-Breaking.
“Wirrameju”: Many farmers
have come to me with the re-
quest to break-in a colt. When
asked why they don’t do it them-
selves, the excuse is invariably,
“I haven’t time,” or “I’m not
as young as 1 used to be.” These
are the tailenders of the old idea
that colt-breaking is a rough-
and-tumble game fitted only for
young men and that it requires
days and weeks of constant
work to break a colt. Both are
wrong.
Any active man who has half
an hour a day to spare, a bit of
“horse-sense” and some patience
can do it—and finish with a
better hack than the high-riding
youngster. In eight hours (a
half-hour a day for a fortnight)
he can make his wild-eyed colt
into a reasonably decent hack.
Most farmers can afford that
much time.
A horse’s brain can work
actively and clearly for about
20 minutes at a time. After
that, if the breaker keeps at him,
his brain becomes befuddled and
he becomes either cranky or
dopey. This accounts for horses
either “coming to it” suddenly
(when they are actually mentally
exhausted) or suddenly kicking
over the traces when they were
doing very well. Know* from the
beginning how long you can
handle your colt and, whether
you have achieved your end or
not, let him go while his mind
is still clear. If you do this you
can go on next day from where
you left off ; if you succeeded in
making him do what you
wanted, tomorrow he will have
a clearcut idea of the task. If
you persist too long with him,
tomorrow you will have to go
over it all again; you will have
lost some of his confidence, and
he will be either desperately
cranky or stubbornly dopey.
Hence buckjumping hacks and
jibs.
Be patient, move quietly and
'steadily round him, talk to him
a lot, reward his intelligence
with a pat and you will have
the makings of a good, reliable
hack.
Super, for Cows.
“Q.Z.T,”: The application of
super, to pastures and cultiva-
tions will have a marked effect
on the production and consti-
tution of the dairy-stock. Many
failures on a dairy farm are due
to mineral deficiency, and among
these will be found poor breed-
ing results, undersized stock,
short lactation period, and pre-
disposition towards catching dis-
eases.
Where super, can’t be used as
a top-dressing, then its use as a
lick is the next-best course. This
is a good one: 401 b. super., 401 b.
salt, 101 b. ground limestone,
101 b. meat and bonemeal. It
should be thoroughly mixed and
placed at a handy spot in a
suitable trough. Where stock
have not been used to a lick,
ground grain should be added
to the mixture, gradually reduc-
ing it and increasing the lick
mixture. Where imolasses has
been used it may be dropped into
the trough and the stock will
soon get used to the new mix-
ture. The initiative of the aver-
age farmer will overcome the
problem of getting the super, to
the animal, and the results should
be gratifying.
The Percheron.
“E.H.S.”: Far from being
“soft” (B. 24/12 / ’47), the Per-
cheron has stood up to climatic
conditions ranging from the in-
tense cold of the Baltic pro-
vinces to the heat of the Medi-
terranean littoral; it has proved
its hardiness, endurance and
adaptability to climatic condi-
tions in the United States and
Canada and throughout South
America, where it does all the
heavy draught work. I have
seen teams of Percherons log-
hauling, road - making and
ploughing in the steamy heat of
the Argentine and Bolivian
Chaco and in the cold, bleak
rain-forests of southern Chile,
and weight for weight I have
never seen a team do more or
better work in Australia. In my
advocacy of the Percheron I
drew attention to his compact
build, fine legs and sound, sym-
metrically-formed feet, fine
muscular development, excep-
tional activity for his size,
capacity for fast road-work and
ability to work and maintain his
condition on a ration one-third
less than that required for a
Clydesdale. These are irre-
futable facts.
The Final Drop.
“Q.Z.T.”: Incomplete milk-
ing by machines which appear
to be in good order is caused by
the teat-cups crawling up on
the teats as the greater bulk of
the milk is withdrawn, and the
udder structure becomes less
distended with milk. The teat-
cup pinches the teat at its base,
and the result is that the last
portion of the milk cannot get
through, and if the teat-cups are
pulled off at once there remains
a quantity of milk in the udder
to be stripped out.
It is good practice to bear
down a little on the teat-claw
before removing it. The sudden
rush of milk in the sight-glass
for a couple of pulsations will
show that the last of the milk
is being taken away. If the
udder is massaged a little during
this period you will find that the
cow is already stripped out en-
tirely, and there is no need for
hand-stripping at all.
Fodder Trees.
“Agric”: Queensland Director
of Forests is arranging for the
raising of fodder-tree seedlings
for planting by stock-owners.
Kurrajong, Portuguese elm and
Bella sombra, his department
states, have a protein content
comparable with choice lucerne,
and all are suitable for growing
on the Darling Downs and
south - western Queensland.
Kurrajong and elm also do well
in the central west, while the
elm has achieved its greatest de-
velopment in the Burnett district.
The bottle-tree, weeping myall,
mulga and carob bean are all
recommended by the depart-
ment, which states that the
bottle-tree is rich in starchy
material and comparable with
fair-quality oats, while weeping
myall may be regarded as com-
parable with good oaten hay.
Mulga grows best in the
Maranoa and far south-west,
and responds readily to natural
regeneration. The carob bean
is for somewhat cooler parts,
such as the Darling Downs and
Southern Highlands. The bean
approximates the composition
and feeding value of sorghum.
Weakling Chicks.
“Urana”; In every batch of
day-olds and in many small
clutches there will be a couple
which fail to thrive like the rest.
Their appetites are good and
they seem healthy enough, but
after a couple of weeks you will
notice a perceptible difference in
the size. These runts should be
killed as soon as they are
noticed. We tend to regard
them as pets and to give them
extra attention and care in the
hope that they will soon catch
up to the others. It is waste of
time. Xhey will never become
healthy, and, because of that,
will always be the first to catch
disease. Not only that, but they
will be a source of infection
among the other birds, and as
well as losing them you may lose
a dozen or so of their sisters
before the season is over.
Shade Trees.
“Myrr”; A good shade-tree
needs to be wind-firm, with a
dense, spreading crown, and for
this, deciduous trees are prefer-
able. Some of the best for
cooler Victorian districts are the
elm, weeping willow, oak, plane,
linden, horse-chestnut and ash.
Some imported evergreens do
well in these districts, and the
conifers, cedar and cypress, are
worth planting where heavy
shade in the winter y/ill not be
detrimental.
For warmer areas, Queensland
white cedar, kurrajong, sugar-
gum, jacaranda, pyramid-tree,
Cape chestnut and native pine
do well. Plant either evergreen
or deciduous trees as single
specimens or in clumps, but not
too close together or develop-
ment of the crown, the most
desirable feature of the shade
tree, will be restricted. Although
not usually planted until late
autumn or winter, look around
now and decide where they are
*o go.
Keeping the Bull at Home.
“N’gaduri”: Ordinary fences
(six-wire and barb, etc.) are
practically useless for holding a
bull which has acquired the fenc-
ing habit. The only sure cure
is the electrified barb, placed in-
side the fence about a foot from
the posts and 2ft. 9in. above
ground-level.
The best alternative is to give
the bull a permanent mate. A
barren cow which comes regu-
larly in season is by far the best.

paddock or when he is shifted to
the herd, she should always be
moved with him. The bull will
be quieter, will be more easily
moved from paddock to paddock
and have less tendency to roam.
Such cows are easily obtained —
they are always being sold be-
cause of their sterility—and one
will earn more than her keep in
time and trouble saved.
The Poultry-House.
“Myrrhee”; Build the poultry-
house where the drainage will
flow away from, rather than
towards, the foundations, and
face it north or east with back
and ends enclosed. Ventilate by
placing a hinged board 6in. wide
along the full length of the roof
at the rear. Make it not less
than Bft. high in front, 6ft. at
the rear and deep enough (say
20ft.) to allow the birds to roost
well away from the front. Allow
each bird 4 sq. ft. of floor-space
and Sin. of perch-room. Hang
perches by wire from the roof,
16in. apart, level and not more
than 2ft. 6in. from the floor,
A manure pit with a netting
lift-up cover to facilitate clean-
ing will prolong the life of the
scratching litter and provide
better manure. The litter needs
to be removed once a month and
the house thoroughly sprayed
with disinfectant. Dig over or
plough the outside runs as the
need becomes obvious. A crop
of greenstuff on these runs will
sweet en them and provide a
green p i c k i ater on .
Hints far the Farm,
“Sundowner”: Leave all
utensils used in the dairy bone-
dry; a wet utensil encourages
bacteria. Best method is to
treat utensils with boiling water
or steam long enough to make
them piping-hot; heat carried in
the metal will be sufficient to
dry the utensils quickly if they
are placed in an airy position to
drain. Hold can-mouths up-
wards to allow steam to escape
and then invert on clean racks.
“Mr.”: As a balance for pigs
on grain without skim-milk give
ilb. of meatmeal to replace
half a gallon of milk daily to
each pig from weaner to baconer
stages. Green hay or chaff will
provide a full diet with the addi-
tion of an ounce daily of a mix-
ture of four parts of ground
limestone and 11b. of salt for all
except suckling sows, which need
2oz. of it.
“W. Court”: When buying
horses or cattle from the
breeders study the breeder’s
feed policy. If he overstocks,
his stock are likely to know all
the tricks of getting through,
over or under fences. Even
when moved on to good grazing,
stock from overstocked country
don’t lose their contempt of
fences and will always try to
break through,
“Big Billy”; Horses affected
by lice should be clipped and
treated by working kero, emul-
sion, sheep-dip or nicotine solu-
tion into the skin. Repeat
treatment in two weeks to de-
stroy lice hatched from eggs not
killed by the first application.
Kero, emulsion is easily made
by mixing lib. of soft soap in
Igal. of hot water and stirring
in a pint of kerosene as it cools.
Mix loz. of nicotine sulphate
with Igal. of soapy water to get
the nicotine-sulphate lotion.
Use sheep-dip at same strength
as for dipping, but see that the
horses don’t lick the poison.
“Plane Creek”; Many a
horse has died from sunstroke
as a result of being tied up short
in the full glare of the sun.
Unless he is driven rapidly and
constantly over a period of
hours the horse actually at work
is much less likely to be severely
affected by the sun’s heat than
the idle one.
“Bumble”: Weak colonies in
the apiary will come to grief if
not given attention when nectar
supplies weaken or fail. The
starving colony is likely to
swarm out and, attracted by the
flight of bees at a strong hive,
will fly in at the entrance. That’s
why a cluster of dead bees) and
queen is sometimes found.
They’ve been killed and thrown
out. Once a colony is low in
workers it’s likely that most of
the field bees will join in with
stronger flights and the hive be-
comes depleted to hopelessness.
At the sudden cessation of a
honey-flow the weak colonies
may be rot?bed of their honey
stores by their neighbors. Build
up these hives with brood and
honey from the strong ones, a
frame or two a fortnight, ac-
cording to what the bees can
cover. Don’t allow honey stores
to get too low in any hive and
replace old or faulty queens
when the colonies are brought
*up to reasonable strength.
“C.A.A.”: An aeroplane was
used for the first time to combat
coast sickness in New Zealand.
Experiments on a hilly farm
showed that top-dressing with
cobaltised super, could be done
at a cost of 7d. per acre by plane
as against Is. by usual methods.
The plane appears to have solved
the problem of treating inacces-
sible country with fertilisers.
“Bill C.”: To temper a drill
for boring hard steel, heat the
point of a cast-steel drill slowly
to redness, file away the scale
and dip the point quickly in
mercury. Then dip the whole
drill in cold water. It should
then bore through the hardest
steel.

UP and down, up and down,
and there were the two
furrows open for the grain. Tub
and Judy got unexpected respite.
They heaved a little from the
four furrows and looked at Jim
in mild inquiry. No doubt they
summed up the situation in their
own way and to their own
satisfaction.
Jim seized the bag and quickly
planted the seed. He settled the
question of whether to sow
three grains together at yard in-
tervals or single grains a foot
apart. In all it was easier with
single grains—so single grains it
was.
That done, then on again with
the plough—four times up and
four times down now, and then
the sowing once more.
The land widened; the moon
sank to the western hills and
the first light of dawn quivered
in the east. Birds woke and
twittered and sang, and the
kookaburras laughed harshly
and joyously. Distant roosters
crowed, and the high hill to the

rounded masses of the cabbage-

said Mrs. Brady. The idea! To

was agreed that he could go to
early Mass —eight o’clock, and
do as he liked after that. There
was still a good day left, and
he made the most of it.
It went on the next week, early

matter so much—Jim could
manage pretty well now by star-

first planting of seed was begin-

could faintly trace the rows
already—and fairly straight, too,

wanted the rows to be straight.

good as it might have been, that
was Mr. Brady’s fault.
“He’s a difficult patient,” he
complained to Mrs. Brady. Mrs.
Brady said “Yes, doctor, he is
difficult.”
Another week gone, another
Saturday and Sunday, and the
job was nearly done. Jim broke
a share on a huge stone —they
were only cast shares; one
should have steel shares in such
ground. He raced through the
scrub to Farran’s, and was
fortunate enough to get another
share, and hardly stayed long
enough to tell old Farran what
for. That was the second Satur-
day.
Old Farran laughed in his
thin cackling way as he watched
Jim race off. “He! he! Corn
into the oat stubble! Did you
ever hear?” He added with
satisfaction: “Great farmers,
those Bradys!” But the job
went on again.
The following Wednesday the
job was finished —the whole 10
acres planted out, and Jim more
exhilarated with his success
than he had been with anything
in his life. And not an hour
missed from school, and the
cows milked as usual, and his
homework done. Not so well
perhaps, for Jim was pretty tired
by night time, but still it was
done.
His father was out of all
danger now, weak, but convales-
cent. Dr. Small said: “No,
you’ll do nothing for weeks. For
weeks! I said. Do you hear?
What’s that you said? Noth-
ing! All right. But if you go
getting round I’ll not be respon-
sible for you. Do you hear?”
But Mr. Brady was not so
anxious to be getting round. For
once he was taking the knock.
He was weak, pleasantly, pain-
lessly weak, and satisfied at last
to let things go. Mrs. Swannel
had gone home. Good soul —
the house was different without
her, even if she did make a
noise when she drank tea.
Jim had kept saying to his
father “You’ll see! But not a
word, Dad.”
Mr. Brady, if curious, was
satisfied; and Mrs. Brady
couldn’t keep down a feeling of
satisfaction that only a little of
the corn could have been
planted. In a way it was a small
victory td her. Very small, but
a victory against the land.
LATE spring that year was a
good one. Rain every week
or two—good soaking rain, and
the ground never dried out
properly. The 10-acre was wav-
ing dark green, corn two feet
high and more when Mr. Brady
was at last deemed fit for a tour
of inspection. He was not back
to his old self yet —it must have
been more than pneumonia that
had got him, but whatever it
was he had beaten it.
Jim had dreamt for days and
weeks of this —this tour of in-
spection. It was Saturday morn-
ing—clear and mild and not like
mid-December with its too often
searing winds. The slopes and
flats had not yet browned off
properly to their usual uniform
for the summer.
“I’ll take Tub along,” said
Jim.
“What for?” asked his father,
“Oh, you’ll see.”
They went up the track past
the cowyard, and then along the
sidling, walking slowly, with
Tub plodding patiently behind.
At the end of the sidling, where
the dry track sloped down to
the hollow, was a thin strip of
timber, yellow-box and grey
gum, saplings mostly, but a
screen for what lay beyond.
Through the timber they went,
and then the 10-acre burst upon
them in all its glory. Mr. Brady
stood and gazed and tried to
convince himself. At last he said
“Who?”
> Jim, bursting with pride, but
suddenly modest, couldn’t look
at his father. He was longing
to say “I did, Dad,” but he
couldn’t.
“You did?”
Jim nodded.
“By the Lord Harry, boy, but
I’m proud of you. You’ll be a
better farmer nor ever I was!”
And then “But when, boy?”
“Oh, just at odd times, Dad.”
“You’re a real farmer, Jim.”
It was music to Jim.
THEY went down to the slip-
rails and gloated over the
crop. And no crop is finer to
look upon than healthy corn.
And no plant more beautiful
than a healthy stalk of dark-
green corn —strong and grace-
ful and proud. Full of promise
of the good earth’s giving.
“Man alive —but that crop
should go fifty bushels. Fifty if
I know anything.”
“Do you reckon, Dad?” Fifty
was almost unheard of for corn
on the red-soil slopes. And there
were all the barriers of the sum-
mer months before the cobs
could be picked.
“Fifty—and call me a liar if
it doesn’t!”
Mr. Brady’s eyes fairly
sparkled, and he seemed to
throw off the last of his sickness.
“Now, Dad, you just mustn’t,
you know. You are going to
rest on these bags here in the
shade. Tub and I are going
through with the scuffler.”
Jim fitted an ingenious muzzle
of netting-wire over Tub’s nose
to stop the irresistible tempta-
tion to snatch at the growing
corn. He apologised to Tub as
he did it. “Never mind —I’ll
make it up afterwards.” And
he commenced scuffling the long
rows,
A light breeze stirred the
corn —a sweet rustling music,
Mr. Brady couldn’t keep still,
couldn’t stay on those empty
sacks in the shade. He ran long
corn leaves through his fingers
—a silky sound.
“Man alive!” he’d say as Jim
and Tub emerged from a row.
“Man alive —fifty bushels —and
call me a liar if it isn’t.”
A WEEK later Mr. Brady was
in town —Saturday after-
noon, shopping afternoon. He
met Dr. Small.
“You’re a lucky man, Brady,
I hope you know.”
“I am lucky, doctor.”
“I’ll tell you now —touch and
a go it was.”
The inference was ' plain—it
would have been “go” but for
Dr. Small.
“And I’m thanking you, too,
doctor, but you didn’t do it all.
Not by a long chalk.”
“How?” and Dr. Small gave
one of his quick penetrating
glances,
“I’m thanking young Jim, I
am, for a deal of it.”
“Jim!”
“Yes, Jim. Man alive, you
ought to see that corn crop he
put in!”
“Corn! Ah, yes, to be sure.”
The doctor had almost for-
gotten about the corn.
“And I’m telling you, doctor
—fifty bushels —and you can
call me a liar if it isn’t! ”
In the sequel Mr. Brady
escaped this terrible penalty by
something like half a bushel to
the acre. Good yellow-dent!
Nor were the Cuban Queens far
behind in their excellence.
Perhaps Mrs. Brady was able
to enthuse a, little, too.

“I hardly thought there could

“He is rather unique,” she

“Every dog must have his

“Your accent,” said Mrs. Van

A “Quiet Period.”
“After months of a colossally ex-
pensive advertising campaign the
‘Government’s’ objective of a Per-
manent ‘Army’ of 19,000 —less than
the full strength of one 1914-18
division —has fallen short in volun-
tary enlistments by alraqst 80 per
cent. Minister for the Army Cham-
bers described it is a ‘quiet period
of enlistment.’ ”
As the Deputy Director of
Voluntary Enlistments remarked
exultantly to the Army’s Union
Liaison Officer (salary £l5OO
p.a., allowances, super Buick,
secretary, etc.) they’d simply
gone mad early that week. ,
On Monday a whole three
of them had made inquiries.
Unfortunately one had mistaken
it for the Salvation Army and
was re-directed. Another offered
to enlist if he could start off as
a brigadier. The third, a fat
fellow, took one look at the
model of a tank and decided he
wouldn’t join the armored corps
as he felt the available tanks
would fit him too tightly across
the stomach.
They almost landed one the
next morning. The prospective
recruit was on the point of
signing-up when the Union
Liaison Officer warned him that
those who didn’t take out a
union ticket would suffer certain
pecuniary and promotional dis-
advantages compared with
unionists and would have to do
extra guard- and fatigue-duty.
Just after the prospective re-
cruit had given vivid instructions
to the U.L.O. as to the disposal
of the job and departed the
D.D.V.E.’s flagging spirits were
revived by the arrival of one
who announced that he was
anxious to enlist. He had had
long experience as a chef. He
would like a job in the cook-
house, if he- could get it. He
was informed he couldn’t have
that —the only vacant cookhouse
job had been given a few days
before to a fitter and turner.
However, if he joined up the
Army would give him a chance
to learn fittirfg and turning.
When this hectic rush of re-
cruits began to slacken off it was
decided to intensify the adver-
tising campaign—after all, it was
only the taxpayers’ money, and
up to date, the getting of each
recruit had cost no more than
£ 1720 in advertising. Among the
new amenities promised, in addi-
“What time do We get back to Funland Park, darling?”
tion to free beer and unlimited
supplies of bath salts, were two
weeks’ notice of intention to hold
rifle- and kit-inspections, a strict
“dafg” to be enforced on the
output of right-turns, left-wheels
and halts, recognition of the
sacred right to ; strike if any por-
tion of a log of claims in a new
award were refused, privates to
enjoy the right to refuse to obey
such orders by officers con-
sidered by the union delegate to
be unreasonable or undignified,
one batman for each private,
free lottery ticket each week and
unfettered s.p. facilities.
So wonderful was the response
that the Minister for the Army
couldn’t get a wink of sleep after
nine in the morning, and though
it was estimated tha't the adver-
tising-cost per enlisted man
would shoot up to £2380 it was
considered well worth it.
The new Permanent Army
now had a Major-General, an
Adjutant-General, a Quarter-
master-General, four brigadiers,
17 staff-captains and two staff-
sergeants, and the Government
considered that with a few
privates a well-balanced force
capable of repelling any invader
would be in sight.
On a bright morning shortly
after the new advertising cam-
paign had been launched there
reverberated around the bar-
racks-square a stentorian,
raucous “Squ-a-ad, for-rm —
wail for it, dammit, wait for it!
—for-r-m singles!” On hear-
ing this a colonel who was just
having a whisky-and-soda in-
haled the rest of it, a brigade-
major sobbingly started polish-
ing his own boots, and a staff-
captain, who was shaving, was
so overcome he began lathering-
up his nose.
The G.0.C., when his blood-
pressure had simmered down to
around 230, roared for the
nearest officer.-
“What’s that adjectival half-
wit out-there giving the order to
form singles for?” he barked.
“I’ve never heard of”
“It’s a staff-sergeant, Sir,” in-
terrupted the lieutenant hastily.
“He’s parading the total week’s
recruitment. He can’t form any-
thing else but singles—there’s
only one of ’em. Sir! ”

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND

A Northern Story
That account of the Hill brothers’ trip
overland from Higginsfield to Cairns (B.
7/1 / ’4B) will evoke both reminiscences
and admiration from several thousand
troops who made the trip in September,
1943, and particularly from members of
the Fd. Co. R.A.E., which preceded the
main body to make passable the many
deep dry sandy river-beds of the lower
part of the peninsula and to build tempo-
rary bridges across the many rivers in
the upper part.
If, before they set out on the trip with
26-ton lorries, the Hill brothers knew
what they had to face, my admiration for
their courage is all the greater.
I was by no means the first to make
the trip during the war, but I went ahead
of the field company to reconnoitre the
route, which was apparently the same as
that followed by the Hills. Our vehicles
were a jeep and a command-car. Even
those, lightly loaded and powerful, had
considerable difficulty in negotiating some
of the unbridged river-crossings in the
far north. We would have said at that
time that it was impossible to take a
26-ton lorry over the “road,” and, know-
ing the road, we doff our hats to the
seven men who did it.
There was one unforgettable incident in
the field company’s trip. One night the
convoy camped near Wrotham Park
homestead, 30 miles south of Mitchell
River. Just on dusk a temporary driver,
in changing the wheels of his vehicle,
undid the wrong nuts —the ones painted
ted which held the split-wheel together
and which all experienced drivers know
must be undone only when the tyre is
deflated. Most who made the mistake
were killed instantly. Our sapper had
his skull laid open and the brain exposed.
The medical officer travelling with the
company said that, if he could be opera-
ted on within five hours, he’d have a
fair chance of living.
By this time heavy rain began to fall.
The O.C. convoy had to go 10 miles to
the nearest telephone and, after some
difficulty, got in touch with the control
officer at Cairns aerodrome. He ex-
plained that there was an emergency strip
near Wrotham Park, but that it had not
been used for some years and its condition
was unknown. R.A.A.F. didn’t hesitate,
but said they’d try to get an ambulance
plane in and gave instructions as to light-
ing the strip with vehicle headlights.
The O.C. set off back to camp to
get the vehicles out to the strip and, inci-
dentally, to remove a fence which, in
the years of its disuse, had been built
across the landing strip. Half-way back
his truck became hopelessly bogged in
the black soil, so he had to run the re-
maining five miles. By that time the
plane was about due, so the vehicles had
to move out to the strip without lights.
As they neared the field the plane was
heard overhead —to have found the
emergency strip was, in itself, no mean
feat. The O.C. immediately switched
on lights and‘got the vehicles into posi-
tion. The plane came back, made a trial
run over the strip and then came in to
land, with brakes hard on.
The pilot was asked how much length
he needed for a landing. He said he
really needed 1700 ft. —he had done it in
the 700 ft. available. As well as pilot
and co-pilot, the plane carried a medical
officer and a nurse. The patient was taken
aboard and within five hours of the
accident he underwent a successful opera-
tion in Cairns and ultimately made a com-
plete recovery.
The names of the crew of that plane
are not known to members of the field
company. Perhaps such hazardous flights
were all in the day’s work for them. If
the four members of the crew of that
plane should read this may they know
that every member of the field company
will always pay tribute to their courage
in risking their lives to save our cobber.
—K. M. C. (N.S.W.).
“Nationalised”
All the old familiar phenomena of Gov-
ernmental enterprise are being repeated
b y T.-A.A. The Airlines Commission
proposes to cut T.-A.A. fares to counter
competition, the idea —first minted by a
competitor—-being to provide a “second-
class” service, eliminate frills —“air-
hostesses” and the like —and abandon un-
profitable services. If it works the com-
mission will no doubt drive perfectly
good private airlines out of business, and
for this loss the public will have to pay,
as it had to pay the half-million lost last
year by T.-A.A., whose incredibly ornate
headquarters opposite Phar Lap’s stable
in Swanslon-street, Melbourne, would
make a good venue for a luxury Holly-
wood film.
State Governments running insolvent
railways object, because reduction would
bring T.-A.A. fares below the cost of
first-class long-distance rail travel. And
what is the use of the nationalised service,
anyway? It enables orchids and frangi-
pani to be flown from Queensland to
compete with Victorian growers. It
allows oysters and fish to be fetched
from Tasmania when Victorian barra-
couta is being thrown into the incinerators
to keep the price up. But what gain is
there to set against the loss of half a
million of taxpayers’ money, and the
other losses in prospect? —C. Q. (Vic.).
Indignation Meeting
I quote from B. 31/12/’47. “Only
blackmarketeers and the booze and bet-
ting interests will benefit when prices have
caught up.”
Aside from an occasional ticket in a
certain consultation, I am not a betting
man, and have had no dealings with black-
marketeers, either as buyer or seller ; but
it seems I do come under the heading of
“booze interests,” as your scribe so elo-
quently puts it.
For your edification I run a very re-
spectable hotel, and it is my duty, by
law, to supply liquor to a traveller, and
the public, within the prescribed hours,
when they require it. Ido just that. I
very much resent the inference that I am
in the same category as your aquaintances
abovementioned. If you are worth your
salt you will apologise. If you don’t I
couldn’t care less.
P.S.; For the edification of you Sydney-
siders, just because your own hotels are
unable to satisfy your Sravenous appetites
you should not presume that that state
of affairs prevails throughout the nation.
It does not. — John C. O’Brien (S.A.).
Made to Last
There was a time when things were
made to last, and some of the things
around our house seem to defy time and
wear—pots and pans still as good as the
day they were bought a copper kettle
which was second-hand on the day we
started housekeeping 20 years ago, and
suitcases which have years of life ahead
of them yet.
We have a clock and watches made
many decades ago and which can still be
depended on to tell the correct time.
There is a portable spirit-stove which
I used in my batching days, over 25 years
ago, and which still boils the kettle in
a jiffy. Boot-brushes in constant use by
many people in our house day after day
for 20 years are still going strong.
Who hasn’t admired in an old house
the solid timbers, well-made locks on the
doors and the sturdy hinges which have
been there for half a century and are
good f or ano ther 50 years? I’m afraid
the next generation won’t have many
such tales to tell of the utility and
austerity goods which are all we can buy
today.— Scotty (Q.).

Housing
While I was in the Army my wife and
two children went to live with my parents.
On my return we immediately set out to
build a new home on a block of land we
already had. When our third child was
born 12 months later we were still trying
to find material to build, and decided,
out of consideration for my parents, to
take a converted Army hut at Herne Bay
settlement (N.S.W.). Here we “lived”
for some months.
Eventually fed up with searching for
materials, we gave up the idea of build-
ing and decided to buy a housed Vacant
possession was promised within a month
by the present tenants, who were in the
last stages of building their own home.
That was five months ago—our tenants
cannot quit' our house because they have
been prevented by shortages from finish-
ing off their own.
It is more than two years since we
began trying to build, and we are still
“living” in a thinly-walled Army hut. My
wife nearly forgets what it feels like to
have a home of her own, and my
children are growing up to accept as nor-
mal a communal “life” in cramped
quarters. Meanwhile our politicians are
busy with banks, taxation and trips over-
seas —far too busy, it seems, to make a
proper effort towards housing the people
whose interests they profess to have at
heart—D. R. I. (N.S.W.).
The Old Order
Labor politicians seem to think that to
be poor is to be miserable, and that higher
wages will bring happiness, contentment
and better homes. 1 wonder. Are the
children of today, with picture-theatres,
free libraries, school meals and generous
pocket money, as happy as I was in the
“Old Order”?
We had no electric radiators or gas
stoves, but a warm kitchen corner on the
floor beside the wood-box, with a westerly
roaring outside, makes a bed of romance.
It was a warm room, and I lay and
blinked at the crimson embers of the
grate and the “fairies” twinkling as the
soot caught fire, and peeped in sleepy
content at the somnolent cat curled upon
the hearth-rug. Sometimes I woke to see
my mother bending forward in the halo
of a kerosene-lamp, peering tiredly at the
needlework with which four lusty boys
filled her basket.
The school was two miles from home,
so I walked four miles a day. We took
dinner sandwiches, thick and bity. We
longed for wet days—then school had
no terrors, but beckoned to us across the
flooding gravel canals we called gutters,
and the long swishing grass that coated
our pants with a fur of seeds. At the
back of our home, climbing the hill, was
a long sloping garden. All I remember
is the ecstasy of the scent of verbena in
it, the humming of bees, the flash of
dragonfly and butterfly, the shade of the
gold of trees in the hot sun, and the grove
of monkey-ropes which inspired us to
play Tarzan among the hanging vines.
The garden is now buried under a row
of jerry-built cottages.
I can recall moments of rapture —
picking mushrooms in misty dawns,
searching for bush violets and shivery-
grass beneath the hedges, lying under a
hedge of wild roses while the hay was
stacked in a near-by field, and the pigeons
and butcher-birds sent down shafts of
music, shouting for joy in the old level
meadow, bathing naked in a tree-hung
creek, and climbing giant Moreton Bay
figs and feeling like pirates in the swaying
mast-tops,
Why aren’t we enjoying this vaunted
New Order? Well, as I recall slink-
ing across a paddock with shirt bulg-
ing with yellow apricots, I ask, “What
was wrong with the Old?” — Macnell
(Vic.).

A Fading Red
There was a time -when Adelaide’s
Botanic Park echoed to the chorus of
“The Internationale” and when large
crowds congregated at the Comrades’
Ring, but times are changing. The same
motley crew are there with the same
threadbare propaganda, but they, have
only trees for an audience.
Speakers made heavy weather of it
last time I was there. A girl had the
stump, but even that novelty fell flat. At
the end of her speech she asked for ques-
tions, but judging by her disregard for
the King’s English she should be asking
questions for a long time to come. She
was the curtain-raiser for the star
speaker, but loud handclaps for him
from the ‘‘applause committee” drew
only an extra one or two to the audience.
He began with the usual diatribe about
“exploitation,” a word that comes naturally
to every Marxist, but which is meaning-
less in Australia. Idle it is for a dema-
gogue to assert that “it is impossible for
a man to get rich honestly.” The prin-
ciples upon which all commerce is
founded are sound to the core, and a man
can become rich by honest industry to-
day as surely as he could a hundred
years ago.
Then I recalled the other days at that
same spot when crowds and enthusiasm
held sway. Only one cbnclusion can be
drawn. The people are tired of this
“comrade” stuff. If the comrades are
wise they will transfer their attention else-
where. They could begin in their spiritual
Fatherland, where millions of slaves await
emancipation,—A, D. (S.A.).
Civilisation or the Bush
£o “Nugget” thinks a revulsion against
civilisation is brewing and that we are
all headed back to the bush (B. 7/1/’4B).
Don’t you believe it —maybe you feel
that way, but what about the missus?
Woman frankly loves the gadgets of
civilisation and hasn’t any time for such
amenities of the bush as ants, flies, dust,
rain and cooking rabbits (after cleaning
’em) squatted on her heels over a smoky
fire.
I think I know that general manager
who hankers for his hut in the moun-
tains, his shorts and his suntan. It had
been raining like hell for a week when
he barged into me on his way down that
mountain to the village, where his £lOOO
car was parked. He’d had the simple life
and all he wanted was his flat at Darling
Point, a decent meal, drinks out of the
refrig., his armchair and his radio. For
the average citizen bush shacks, boats,
camps and trailers are strictly for holi-
day use only, with a line of retreat open
in case the weather breaks.
As a sidelight on the drift to the cities,
after many years of the simple life cir-
cumstances forced me to move into town.
My wife objected strenuously because she
loved life in the free, open bush. But
suggest today that she leave electric lights,
stove, refrig., shops just round the comer
and cinema down the street to go back

Farms and Farmers
Name one grant which is not a “hard
business deal” (B. 31/12/’47)? All right,
what about drought-relief? A farmer
with a substantial credit balance in his
bank, and a farm absolutely free of debt,
collects a couple of hundred pounds for
relief because his crop was rained by
drought. As this is a free grant by the
Government, it follows that the bill is
met by the rest of the taxpayers, in-
cluding the salaried worker, who, per-
haps, hasn’t two bob in the world apart
from his screw.
Various adjustments made by th,e
Farmers’ Debts Adjustment Boards in the
different States also afford ample illus-
tration.
Many unfortunate farmers, through no
fault of their own, have had to seek aid
from the boards, but there are many
others whose troubles are caused solely
by their own muddling and inefficiency.
They are the ones who would be better
forced off the land. Creditors have been
obliged to take a few shillings in the
pound and the boards have also put in
taxpayers’ money to keep these inefficients
on their* holdings.
The mere fact that these Debt Adjust-
ment Boards had to be set up is con-
demnatory in itself. I have never heard
of a Grocers’ Debt Adjustment Board.
For everyone else there is the good old
bankruptcy legislation.
“H.A.C.” says Australia’s rural popu-
lation has declined alarmingly during the
last census interval. Well, there must be
some other reason for that —possibly the
number of farm workers (as distinct from
the cocky himself) has declined because
of the increased use of machinery.
The fact remains that whenever a farm
comes on the market there are buyers
in plenty and the very many returned
soldiers claiming farms cannot be sup-
plied—Harry the Horse (Vic.).


Fhe New Army
I have just been scanning the Army
advertisement for recruits with its photo-
genic soldier waving a roll of notes and
a paybook over his head. Now comes
the hookwn that our bodyguard will
wear an “officer’s-type” uniform, with
collar, tie and shoes, while he receives an
education to fit him to take his place
among his less fortunate fellow-men.
I enlisted 42 years ago today in an
army where the officers wore boots--
“slacks” were the equivalent of sports
clothes and a man wearing spectacles or
false teeth was the laughing-stock of his
mates. A shilling a day was very good
pay then, and, if a man were wounded, he
paid 6d. a day out of that for hospital
stoppages. Our food was lib. of bread,
£lb. of meat and 4d.-worth of tea, sugar,
bacon and what haven’t you. If there are
any “Old Contemptibles” still around
they will remember the first issue of plum-
and-apple jam, and how we built our first
dugouts with the unopened cases, believ-
ing that “pozzy” is not a fit food for
soldiers.
The recruiting sergeant didn’t offer
security then; he offered adventure, and
we got a bellyful of it. It is a fact, too,
that regular soldiers won the Victoria
Crosses and D.C.Ms., and set the example
for later volunteers. Few of these men
qualified for more than a gratuity of £l2
after 12 years’ service, and many
thousands of them are counted in
Britain’s unnamed dead.
I am now waiting to hear whether the
modern soldier places his umbrella beside
his bathrobe at kit-inspections, or
whether this protective weapon is a
“public property” and kept in store with
the rifle, as was a common practice in the
Coast Artillery unit I served with in the
recent disturbance.
Yes, I’m jealous—jealous of the soldier’s
reputation since the publicity experts have
got to work on what is expected from
him. Incidentally, some of The Bulle-
tin’s word-butchers may connect the
soldier’s use of the word “pozzy” in those
early days with the later supposition that
it is a corruption of “position.”— Ole
Bill (N.S.W.).
British Liberals
The trend of world politics over the
last 20 years can be seen by studying the
history of the British Liberals (B.
31/12/’47). They have declined in num-
bers in the Commons from over 300 in
1906 to half a score today. The middle
party of reasonableness 1 , a party of social
justice rather than socialism, it has
steadily declined step by step with the
universal trend to the extremes.
H. Holman is correct when he says
that many Conservatives are Liberals
without knowing it. The recent Tory
Industrial Charter is nothing if rjot
Liberal, and there is little difference be-
tween the policies of the young Tories
Quintin Hogg and Harold MacMillan
and Liberals Isaac Foot and the late
Ramsay Muir. But the relation can be
stressed too far —written policies may be
the same, but there’s an obvious differ-
ence in practice.
Liberalism is all but dead, writes
“H.H.” Well, the party received fulls
2,250,000 votes in the 1945 election when
it contested only half the seats. That
figure is one-fifth of the Tory vote, and
that party contested almost all the seats.
The first-past-the-post voting, as well as
boosting socialist seats to an absurd
figure, ruined the Liberals, who should
have five times as many seats as they
have.
Conservatism is leagues nearer liberal-
ism than is socialism, but this is no rea-
son for liberal-minded Britons to desert
the Liberal party for the Conservatives,
The Liberal party is not dead yet.—
Nedrium (Vic.).
Government Insurance Rates
Under “The Little Man” (B.
10/12/’47), “R.H.C.” refers to the cost
of workers’ compensation insurance in
respect of bushworkers and timber-
getters, and goes on to say:
He cannot face the enormous respon-
sibility now. Insurance in the timber game
is £ll 10s. per £lOO wages paid. Govern-
ment insurance offices charge more.
In Western Australia, the tariff rate
is £lO 10s. per cent., and the rate of the
State Government Insurance Office is
£lO per cent. In N. S. Wales the official
rate of the Insurance Premiums Com-
mittee is £ll 19s. per cent., and our own
rate is £lO per cent. The rates are high,
but they are warranted on the claims
experience.
“R.H.G.’s” statement that Government
insurance offices charge more than the
tariff companies for this type of risk is
incorrect. —General Manager, N. S. Wales
Government Insurance Office.
The Press
There are more ways of silencing a
watchdog than hitting it over the head
with a waddy. It can be starved or
muzzled, or its tail can be cut off just
behind the ears.
The first step towards dictatorship is
the silencing of the press. It is done
suddenly by decree when possible, or by
degrees when necessary, but it must be
done somehow before a nation can be
robbed of its four freedoms and reduced
to the status of a mob of dumb, driven
cattle.
In Australia the starvation treatment
is being applied in the sacred name of
dollar economy, but it will be just as
effective as if it were called political ex-
pediency. Neither the editor nor his old
friend “Pro Bono
Publico” can ex-
press “dangerous
thoughts'” when
space is rationed to
vanishing point.
World-shaking news
must be boiled down
and presented with-
out comment.
Events of national
or local interest
must be reported
curtly or ignored.
The public is kept
i n ignorance o f
social and anti-
social movements
that affect its wel-
fare.
With all its faults,
the press is the
watchdog of the
people’s rights, and
its ability to bark
and bite is worth
more than all the
dollars ever printed.
Economy should be-
gin an Canberra. If
this were done there would be no need
to reduce the press to the condition of a
Belsen skeleton. —Bow Wow (S.A.),
The 40-Hour Week
In most trades shorter working hours
can only mean reduced production, higher
costs and increased prices, particularly
as the demand for goods that are scarce
becomes more frantic.
Why not allow a man to work as and
when he desires with payment by results
and a minimum wage to take care of the
infirm or less skilful worker? In spite
of the noisy minority who prefer to loaf
or take things easily, most men like their
work. Employers and employees must
get together and work out their joint sal-
vation. They need each other’s co-opera-
tion badly if they are to survive. Other-
wise they’ll all be in State jobs, and then
Heaven help the nation, for it will need
help.—A. G. Ricola (Q.).
Where is the logic in cutting down
working hours in face of the undeniable
shortage of labor and goods? Where is
the sensei —or justice—in legislating to
cause a bricklayer to work only 40 hours
a week for his boss if he is going to take
on a contract to lay bricks in his spare
time? If his need for leisure is so great,
or the strain on his health is so severe
he should be doing anything but brick-
laying. Otherwise the community is best
served by the bricklayer pulling his weight
in his boss’s team.
Service to the community, truly, is
something that went out of fashion on
September 3, 1939. That date ushered
in a new era which has little to commend
it and which, it seems, will only be ended
by a first-class depression when men will
realise that their chance of employment
will be gauged by their worth to the
community, when the men who are pre-
pared to work will get what jobs are
available, and when competition for those
jobs will result in a return to a decent
day’s effort.
This country is suffering more than
ever before because the working man
thinks he is hurting the “boss” by refus-
ing to work more than so many hours
or to turn out more than so much work.
The cost of his loafing goes on to the
finished product, for which, in the long
run, the working-man pays.
If private employers throw in the towel
and the Government takes over produc-
tion of consumer goods, the working-
man will get it in the neck. Any deficit
on the sale of Government production
will always be made up out of taxation
—and it’s always the working-man who
pays taxes till it hurts. — Jindivick
(N.S.W.).
“Pidgin”
Without joining issue on any other
matter in The Bulletin’s leader on New
Guinea (10/12/’47), I protest that the
article shows a poor appreciation of New
Guinea pidgin.
Pidgin is a language which has grown
up in N.G. It was derived from the
English of the sailing-ship crews who
visited it before the Germans took over
the country. When the Germans came,
they found that the natives could not
leam German readily, so the Germans
learnt pidgin. It is interesting that the
only two words of pidgin derived from
German are “raus” (get out) and “shut-
man” (policeman), which is rather a com-
mentary on the German contribution to
culture. Native languages, principally
Blanche Bay dialect, were drawn on for
names of flora and fauna. The Chinese
contributed “Masski.” And, too, the
original pronunciation of English words
became “nativised,” an example being the
word “boundary” which is now “arride”
(ar-ri-day).
With use, a simple grammar was
evolved. Future and past tenses are
“Have you any domestic Worry ?”
denoted by the words “behain” (behind)
and “bifor” (before). Transitive verbs
are distinguished from the intransitive by
the suffix “im” (as in “mi killim pig”
compared with “mi go”), while nouns
and verbs of personal function are dupli-
cated words, as in “kaikai” and others
which come too easily to the memory.
Even the dual inclusive plural was
adopted from the native speech, as in “mi
tufelo i go” (me two fellow he go),
though there is no distinction between the
singular and the plural in the pronoun
or the verb.
After 1914, more English words were
introduced, enlarging the vocabulary,
but the native pronunciation was applied
to the new words. Strangely enough, a
few words which should have been
English weren’t, as, for instance, “balus”
meaning aeroplane. (“Balus” is Blanche
Bay language for pigeon, but in pidgin,
the word “pidgin” means any bird. That
is how easy it all is.) In all, the vocabu-
lary grew to about a thousand words.
In N.G. there is a different native
language about every 20 miles. As a
result, few natives can speak to each
other except in pidgin, which they can
learn in a year. This is its great virtue as
a language. It suits the native mentality,
and is also the only medium between
most Asiatics and Europeans.
Phonetic spelling was introduced for
native names, including names of places.
There was no alternative. Missionaries
learned native languages and reduced
them to writing, using phonetic spelling.
Again there was no alternative. Then
natives were taught to read and write
their own languages, and these soon wrote
pidgin, using thp phonetic spelling to
which they were accustomed. Pidgin
developed into a written as well as a
spoken language, by native usage and
without the aid of any “socialistic bureau-
crats.” Incidentally, one of the greatest
champions of phonetic spelling of native
names was Hubert Murray.
Whether the Administration should or
should not publish a native newspaper
may be debatable, but there can be no
doubt that, if one is published, it should
be in pidgin as the natives write it. —
Also Ran (Q.).
Unpaid Clerks
Who, asks The Bulletin (7/1/’4B), is
to collect the rents from sojourners in
N. S. Wales “Labor’s” proposed holiday-
camps for workers? The answer, of
course, is the wages-clerks employed by
the cursed capitalists.
The inventors of the holiday-camps
scheme propose that workers should save
for their holidays by weekly deductions
from their wages, and weary wages-clerks
sigh “Another flamin’ deduction! ” It
would be interesting if some statistically-
minded fellow would work out what per-
centage of a wages-clerk’s time is taken up
in actually calculating wages (no simple
job with the silly tangle of fractional
hourly rates which our “system” has
saddled on to them) and in making
“deductions” in the interests of some-
body who doesn’t pay a red cent towards
the cost.
. Each “deduction” involves the keeping
of separate records —ledger accounts.
personal accounts for each employee,
payments and what not. It’s no joke
when the payroll runs to several hundreds
of names. What are these “deductions”?
Well, income tax, union dues, hospital
contributions, ambulance ditto, group in-
surance, savings certificates, Common-
wealth-loan instalments, rents for Gov-
ernment houses —no doubt some Sad
Sack can add to this list. — Kell (N.S.W.).
Root of the Matter
Queensland “Labor” is showing the
electors they won’t get anything done
unless they put “Labor” in every time.
Before the State elections last year, the
Government called tenders for the build-
ing of a new hospital at Dalby (Q.) but,
after “Labor” got the boot in Dalby, the
Public Works Department vetoed the
scheme with the excuse that it would cost
too much money. The money question
apparently didn’t matter when there was
a chance of “Labor” getting in again—
before the elections about £2OOO was spent
on plans for the hospital.—W. C. (Q.).
I was pleased to hear from my infor-
mative little wireless-set that Australia is
now producing fighter aircraft—“ Mustang
fighters are now coming off the assembly
line in Australia.” If we continue to
produce them I feel sure that no aggressive
foreign Power will dare antagonise us,
especially if they have only those new-
fangled jet and rocket planes to back
them up.— Lim-Limbu (N.G.).
Scouting round the shops for a reel of
ordinary white cotton I got only curt re-
fusals and the kind of looks that used to
go with “Don’t you know there’s a war
on?” Giving up in disgust, I wondered
why Australia doesn’t grow its own cot-
ton instead of relying on other countries.
Queensland, of course, grows a bit, but
not nearly enough. We’ll have to do
something about it soon —what with a
world shortage of the stuff and the “dollar
position,” cotton may soon be scarcer
here than ever. And our sheets and
pillow-cases can’t last for ever. — Mac
(N.S.W.).
I’d recommend Emerald, Capella and
Clermont districts of Queensland to
soldiers determined to go on the land.
Twenty-four-inch rainfall, heavy downs
alternating with ridges of lighter soils
and all in the same “lie” of country as
Roma and Kingaroy. The market-value
of properties is the lowest in the State.
Although the Queensland Lands Depart-
ment says “No,” I believe the country
suitable for raising fat lambs, and Cannon
Hill (fat market) to be near enough.
Several old sheep stations there grew
fodder crops as a regular thing. Pests?
White speargrass, feather-top, mint and
worms. Climate, pests and general
problems would need studying, but for a
resolute man a 24-inch rainfall, good
land, low capital cost and rail connection
looks all right to me. — Hadley Propsting
(Q-).
“A.F.D.” (B. 19/11 /’47) made some
good points in his remarks about the
condition of the Kendall Monument
(N.S.W.). How many of those who
have scratched their unworthy names on
the stone had ever heard of Kendall? It
is a safe bet that not one could name
two of his poems. That brings up the
question of whether we appreciate our
native bards. Why isn’t more taught of
such men in our schools, and less about
how many people live in Tibet or what
are the rivers in Paraguay?—L. A. W.
(N.S.W.).
For years we’ve had it drummed into
us that young Australians are the best
immigrants. Yet about 95 per cent,
of young couples getting married today
are compelled to live in one room among
“in-laws” without the remotest chance
of a home for years. The slender hope
they do possess of renting a house is lost
once a child arrives, and the financial
burden shouldered by people with a
family automatically precludes them from
competing with “blackmarket” sharks
who obtain the few houses being sold
these days. No wonder the authorities
are chasing all over the world for immi-
grants. —K. V. H. (Vic.).
It’s a pity that Australian bushrangers,
convicts and other misfortunes are made
into talkies. We’ve had one excellent
talkie featuring the life of Sir Charles
Kingsford Smith, and it would be well
to follow that with stories of such char-
acters as Caroline Chisholm, John
Forrest and even Tyson. Such great
undertakings as the crossing of the
Blue Mountains, the building of the
transcontinental railway and the over-
land telegraph line, the Kalgoorlie watei
supply and even the Sydney harbor bridge
would all provide good film material. —
