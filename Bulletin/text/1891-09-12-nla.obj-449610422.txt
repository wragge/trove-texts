The Co-Operative
SYSTEM, the nearest approach to Socialism that can be achieved tinder the
present conditions of life, has met with phenomenal success wherever it has
been applied to any object. In England, even the Co-operative Societies
benefit some millions of persons —their membership exceeding a million and
a-half, and hold invested capital to the amount of eleven millions of money.
This success is owing to the fact that the investor sees not only a fair com-
mercial return on his investment, but a proprietary division of profits, which
he would not receive from any other organisation. It has been left to Aus-
tralia to apply this communistic principle to

SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 1891.
The Second Ballot.
Last week another of the vital principles in
the New 7 South Wales Electoral Bill was
thrown overboard, on Parkes’ own motion,
and the unfortunate measure has now 7
scarcely enough principles left to furnish a
sporting newspaper. The original purpose
of this; misguided measure, as set forth in
the Bill’s title, was to provide that every
man should have one vote, and that the
majority should rule in all cases ; but as the
project now stands the majority will not rule
in the future any more than in the past, and
one man shall have one vote now and then
as a matter of accident, and things in general
will be very much as they have been all
along. The moral and mental “innards”
have been eaten out of the Bill, and now 7 the
House is merely squabbling about the hollow
shell—the empty husk out of which all the
contents have been lost. And yet—so
strangely are politicians constituted —the
New South Wales Legislature scrambles for
the bottle, after the liquor has been spilt,
with exactly the same fervour as it scrambled
for the full bottle a few w 7 eeks ago. It does
this, seemingly, from sheer force of habit.
The legislators of the province want an
Electoral Bill, and a Bill with principles in
it or a Bill with nothing in it at all seems to
suit them .equally well. Apparently it would
have answered the purpose in every way if
Parkes had introduced a brown paper bag
instead of a Bill at the beginning, and then
the bag could have been read three times in
the orthodox manner, and amended in com-
mittee, and sent along to the Upper House
in due course, and by-and-bye the Governor
would have graciously assented to the bag,
and it would have been enrolled among the
statutes under the style and title of an Act
for the better Representation of the People.
The consequences to the nation would have
been just the same. A Bill out of which
everything has been dropped, save the paper
and the preamble, is a thing of no account,
and is as hopeless as a religion founded on
the binding-boards of a lost and forgotten
Scripture.
«• # #
The second ballot was abandoned on the
plea that it was in no sense a vital feature of
the great Electoral Bill, and in that case it is
difficult to imagine that tho famous scheme
ever possessed any features whatever. For
as a means of securing the principle of
government by majorities only, the second
ballot fills a want which no other scheme at
present available can fill. The principle of
One-Man-One-Vote was devised to ensure
that a majority of men only should run the
State, and not a minority eked out with
bricks and mortar ; but this reform is of
little account if the minority is still allowed
to rule without the bricks and mortar.
Under the present electoral system a small
but compact body of monopolists, aided by
the mute and soulless votes of wool-stores,
and ash-heaps, and rotting wharves, and
slimy, untenantable swamps, can man down
a large body of mere human beings ; and if
the electoral system is continued, with
merely the abolition of the property vote,
the same body of monopolists will, in a large
number of cases, get there just the same.
It will require a little more organisation, a
little harder swindling, and a new variety of
hard lying, but there will be no difference in
the result. A hitherto somewhat neglected
fraud will be.put into more active operation,
and an old and hard-worked fraud will have
a long and well-deserved rest, but otherwise
there will be ilo change 1 .
* * #
When the old plural vote is abolished, the
one purpose of the party organiser—which
is a gentle synonym for the party swindler
—will be to split the hostile party by putting
up bogus candidates. This scheme has been
worked very successfully in the past, only
the political bosses were too busy falsifying
the electoral-rolls to give it the attention it
deserved The absurd system by which the
nation is debarred from giving its opinion on
any subject, save by supporting or ejecting
the Government, makes the work compara-
tively easy. There arc seldom less than a
dozen burning questions before the electors,
and the individual voter who takes an
interest in all these issues, probably finds
that the party in power represents about six
of his principles, and that the party in oppo-
sition represents the other six. Conse-
quently, he must vote against one-half his
creed, and he has to choose as best he can
which half is tho more important. There-
fore, of two individuals who believe in
Protection and Republicanism, one may vote
for a Freetrader who is a Republican, and
the other for a Protectionist and Imperialist,
according as either decides which is tho
principle that can best be spared. Under
these circumstances, it is difficult to resolve
on which issues the election will be decided,
and any party that, by judicious organisa-
tion, can secure the nomination of a number
of candidates on various side issues, can
effectually split up the votes of its oppo-
nents. To do this, money and influence
arc the two essentials. Sometimes the
“sidecandidate” is an open traitor, who has
to be bought with hard cash at ordinary
sausage rates ; very often he is an ambitious
but impecunious individual, who merely
requires to have his expenses paid by some
philanthropic supporter—in which case his
opponents supply the philanthropy and the
supporter; sometimes he is simply an
elaborate ass who needs judicious “cokurn”
to induce him to come forward, and in that
case the other side pays for the “cokum;” In
any case money is necessary for conducting
the swindle, and here the party of property
finds its opportunity, and the party without
property gets left.
# # #
Given the candidate, who is always pro-
curable, the rest of the process is simple,
If the issue hinges on the rival questions of
Protection and Foreign-trade, and the
Foreign-trade party is conducting the poli-
tical fraud of tho hour, then the bogus
individual is probably put up on the cold-
water ticket, with a leaning towards Protec-
tion as a secondary article of faith. His
case is hopeless from the start, but he is too
solemn a fanatic to be aware of the fact.
He successfully, and in a strictly honourable
manner, divides the party’s vote, for he
scoops the suffrages of ail those teetotal
Protectionists whose ideas upon drinkables
are more pronounced than their ideas on
fiscal subjects, and he wrecks the Protec-
tionist candidate without any possible
benefit to himself. At the same time he
identifies the Protectionist party, to some
extent, with his cold and tasteless fluid, and
diverts the public-house vote to the Foreign-
trade cause. In the same fashion the
Sabbatarian faction can be made use of, for
any shred or fraction of a party, even if it
consists of no more than six men and a dog,
will run a candidate of its own with due and
sufficient encouragement—financial or other-
wise Federation, pious dogmatism, land
problems, coloured labour, white labour—
any question which occupies a reasonably
strong second place can be used in this
manner, and if any of those questions chance
to occupy the first place, then the fiscal issue
becomes the theory on which the bogus can-
didate travels, for the scheme is one which
•answers under any possible circumstances—
save the almost impossible circumstance of
there being no second issue at all to travel on.
* # *
Moreover, the bogus candidate is a pro-
duct which often springs up spontaneously ;
he thrives best when artificially grown, and
manured with coin, but he will grow, if
necessary, on las own account —especially
when election deposr s are obolished. And he
almost always disorganises the majority vote,
and very seldom indeed that of the minority.
If the main contest lies between Labour and
Capital, and Labour is in a powerful
majority, then the teetotal body, or the
Sabbatarian section, or any similar organisa-
tion w'hich proposes to nominate a candidate
of its ow 11, naturally nominates one who will
command the sympathy of the 'Stronger
party. If its choice lies between one ram-
pant abstainer who is identified with Labour
and another, equally rampant, who is iden-
tified with Capital, it chooses the former, for
the sufficient reason that it is easier to steal
votes from a large party than a small one.
The fanatic wlm travels on one single fad,
and believes that all human wisdom is em-
bodied in his one nostrum, whether the
nostrum be Freetrade or Protection, Single-
tax, Republicanism, Imperialism, or any
other under the sun, is. always prepared to
sink all other earthly considerations into the
tophet of hopeless oblivion. If he knows
that the nation has been toiling for years to
reach a certain goal, he will chderfully blast
all its hopes and aspirations in the very
moment when success seems certain, in
order to advertise his one inspiration by
running a squadron of hopeless candidates on
the ticket of his foundered creed. He is a
bowelless individual who has lost all human
sympathy in his devotion to his solitary idea,
and through him the organised minority will
continue to reign in Australia—the boasted
One-man-one-vote system notwithstanding.

The principle of the second ballot is that
the greatest number must rule, and though
not in itself a perfect scheme it is the nearest
approach to perfection of which the present
circumstances admit. If the candidate who
heads the list has an actual majority of the
votes polled, then he is obviously the man of
whom the constituency approves, and his
election is decided ; if no one candidate has
a majority, then the two at the top of the
list must go through the ordeal of a second
election. If there are six issues before the
country, then it is obvious, under the pre-
sent crude and cumbersome system, that the
election must be decided upon one of them
only, for the electoral policy now 7 in use only
admits of the consideration of one question
at a time. The two candidates at the head
of the list almost invariably represent the
different sides of the one question on which
the election must ultimately turn ; and the
second ballot gives those voters who had
previously neglected that question an oppor-
tunity to register their opinions thereon. If
one seat h is been contested by four candi-
dates representing respectively Freetrade,
Protection, Labour, and Capital, and the
two former occupy the leading places, then
it becomes evident that the fiscal question is
tho one on which the decision ultimately
hinges. Meanwhile, however, nearly one-
half of the electors may have expressed no
opinion whatever on this same question, and
until they do so the poll in no sense repre-
sents the feeling of the constituency. The
individuals who have been “ side-tracked” on
to the wrong issue may be three-fourths Pro-
tectionists, or three-fourths Freetraders, and
when the contest is narrowed down to the
one problem on which a settlement can be
arrived at they may completely alter the
result that was first obtained. Until the
principle of the Referendum is introduced,
so that the nation can give a coherent
decision on any one question without destroy-
ing a Parliament and overturning a Govern-
ment to do it, the best that can be hoped for
is that an election will furnish a definite ex-
pression of opinion upon one amid the
dozen great questions of the day. The in-
troduction of the second ballot will enable it
to do this much with reasonable certainty ;
the present system enables it to do nothing
at all, and leads only to dire confusion. At
the last New South Wales election the nation
endeavoured to resolve three great questions,
the settlement of the Labour difficulties, the
establishment of a Protective tariff, and the
Federation of Australia, and the only things
it has gained are Parkes and Freetrade. It
wanted neither of them, but it got wrecked
among three separate ambitions, and a party
which represents none of the three now runs
the political show in consequence.
* * «
The Bulletin freely admits that its own
principles have frequently come uppermost
in the dire confusion that arises out of the
present miscellaneous system, and that its
own party has more than once gained a
success by accident in the general chaos of
politics. More than one Protectionist has
gained a seat which would have otherwise
fallen to some rampant individual of the im-
ported shoddy persuasion, and more than
one Democrat has got in because a Sab-
batarian or teetotal fanatic has split the
hostile vote just sufficiently to keep out the
bloated groveller who would otherwise have
been successful. And this circumstance is
in itself a sufficient proof that the methods
now in use are unjust and exceedingly lop-
sided. The Legislature should be, for good
or evil, the true reflex of the nation. If the
nation wants its importer, or if it pines after
its bloated groveller, it is entitled, by every
axiom of justice, to have him. If it desires
to elect, on an absolutely fair basis, without
undue influence of any kind, a whole Legis-
lature of grovellers and Imperialists and
assorted monopolists,, it certainly should
have every facility to do so. This paper
would doubtless cast strong aspersions on the
sense of the community which could harbour
such a diseased ambition, but against the
equity of the arrangement it would have
nothing whatever to say. The Parliament
of a free country should represent the intel-
ligence of the nation, if it has any ; if it
has no intelligence, then it should accurately
represent the want of that article instead
If it fails to do this, then it is a representa-
tive institution no longer.
# # *
It has been urged against the principle of
the second ballot that it might require half-
a-dozen successive elections before any
definite result was arrived at, but this
argument is too thin to need refutation.
Vet, even if it were true, it counts for very
little. All the vast expense of a general
election is incurred to ascertain the decision
of the people, and if, as under the present
system, no decision is ascertained, then
there might almost as well be no election at
all. Either it is not worth while to expend
a vast amount of toil and hard cash to secure
the return of the people’s representatives, or
it is worth while to spend enough of both to
secure legislators who actually do represent
the people. Apart from the question of
expense there is actually nothing to be urged
against the proposed reform, save that it
will be a serious blow to the great system of
fraud that goes by the name of party organi-
sation. It may be inferred, therefore, with
every show of reason, that the members who
so unanimously dropped the principle of the
second ballot were all individuals who hoped,
at some time or other in the future, to secure
a seat in the Legislature otherwise than by
the suffrages of the majority. No doubt
a very large number of them will come
to grief over their decision, and in-
stead of gaining by the present systun of
election by accident they will be crowded
out by abler shufflers than themselves, but
with amazing unanimity they resolved to
run the risk of being swindled on the off-
chance of swindling somebody else instead;
Out of about ninety members present in the
New 7 South Wales Assembly there was only
one who either preferred to stand or fall on
an honest basis by the vote of the majority,
or else who doubted his abilily to “ do ” his
opponent, and therefore objected to play at
a game in which the other side held the best
cards. His name was O’Sullivan and he
stood absolutely alone in upholding the
democratic principle that the majority must
rule. He wasn’t able even to find a teller to
count him in the division, so he had to
count himself, and when he was added up
the total was exactly one.
The Imperial Stead and His Royal
Highness.
Save us from our friends ! especially the
friends whose only desire appears to be our
salvation. This is an age of missions and
armies—salvation armies and blue-ribbon
armies and boys’ refuge societies, social purity
organisations and societies for rescuing fallen
women. Mr. W. T. Stead, the Dan O’Connor
of ephemeral literature, the Barnum of British
journalism, is a man whose life consists of
engaging in various sporadic missions. He is
the self-constituted saviour of British society,
the originator of Help, Cod’s newspaper vice’-
gerent upon earth. He has damned Mr.
Parnell and Sir Charles Dilke— or thinks
that he has ; he has essayed the rescue of Eliza
Armstrong ; he has now formed himself into
a missionary-societv to save the Prince of
Wales.
* * *
The Review of Reviews, for July, contains
two long articles', both of them apparently from
the pen of the alleged keeper of “ the Noncon-
formist Conscience,” One is a plea for Albert
Edward, the other a glorification of Oliver
Cromwell and his Independents— John Milton
and others. We draw no invidious comparison!
In another part of. Stead’s review appears a
portrait of the present Emperor of Germany.
The “ Plea for the Prince of Wales ” is accom-
panied by no portrait of H.R.H., but in lieu
thereof it is “illustrated with caricatures by
the satirists of the world’s press.” Again, no
invidious comparison ! These little things show
only W.T.S.’s private views of the poo~ "V
creature whose defence he has undertaken
# * #
The keeper of the nonconformist conscience
explains in stai'ting that prayer is not worth a
red cent, and that the more a nation prays the
worse it is for it, and the less likely is it fo
get the thing it prays for. W.T. next knocks
the bottom out of any idea of a personal God,
by insisting that we must not worry about a
superintending Providence. If we have aiiy
troubles we must carry them, not to the
throne of grace, but to the editorial sanctum
— God is a myth, but Stead is a reality,
and there are very few things that cannot
be righted on this terrestrial globe by an
appeal to the proper authority, namely—
the editor of the Review of Reviews. The
next step in the “Plea” is a comparison
instituted between the similarity of conditions
which produce, on the one hand, Albert
Edward, and on the other, a slum prostitute.
Further along the Prince’s position is likened
to that of a long-sentenced criminal in Hollo-
way Gaol, and he is warned and lectured and
chidden throughout the entire length of a very
long article. The fun of it all is that Mr.
Stead tries to shift the responsibility of the
Prince’s actions from his own shoulders on to
those of the people, and further, makes a
demand for Imperialism in order to give
Albert Edward a billet as a tyrant which
would keep him out of mischief as a debauchee.
# * #
The twaddle Stead writes about Albert
Edward’s baccarat adventures nee I not detain
us a moment. Let us get at the gist of the
article. The Prince’s defender makes no
attempt to deny that the subject of his paper is
not a saint. Not at all! He admits that: His
Royal Highness has been a mighty bad egg in
his day. He objects, however, to anyone
“slanging the Prince of Wales after he has
become a grandfather for the sins of his youth. ’
In this very article, and in other parts of this
same number of his magazine, Mr. Stead
“slangs” both Parnell and Dilke for past
offences, and denies strenuously the sincerity of
their repentance. Evidently these persecuted
statesmen have only to become “ grandfathers
and everything will be condoned. Happy
thought ! / Who knows that they are not grand-
fathers now ?
# # #
Mr. Stead is altogether too brutally rough
on the Prince ! Listen to this :
Even supposing all the current gossip to be correct,
the exaggerated condemnation passed upon baccarat con-
trasts so much with the silence observed about the olher
things, as to imply that card-playing is far more heinous
than other offences which, although not judicially proved,
are nevertheless almost universally assumed to he true.


r m ie defence set up for the* Prince by Mr.-
Stkad is that being shut out of an administra-
tive billet, he feels very bored and takes up
( i-playing ; and, in his hot youth, he took up
Ither things. The same excuse will apply to
the gentle murderer whb, feeling “ bored,” fills
lus spare time with delicate experiments in
infanticide. The remedy for the Prince’s
wickedness is finding him something to do
similar to that so ably carried out by his
nephew, the Emperor of Germany. Failing the
establishment of a respectable tyranny which
would furnish the little fat baccarat man with a
congenial job, he might serve on a Royal Com-
mission or so —say, on the Labour Commission,
or on a Commission to cement the bonds, &c.,
between the dear old mother-thingummy and
our “children over the sea”—with the usual
Steadian frillings. And if this cannot be done
Lwell, he is still a grandfather, and a deal may
1)e expected from a bald, elderly gentleman over
30 w ho is neither, to use Stead’s words, “an
imbecile nor a genius.”,
# * *
The proposition to save the Prince by con-
verting the English constitution from a limited
monarchy into a sort of Russian or German
Czarite is direct and undisguised. These are
the words used by the Imperial Stead
How it could be done ! The Prince remarked, the
other day, to a friend of his, somewhat pensively, upon
the difference between his nephew, William, of Germany,
and himself. “Look at my nephew,” he said. “He is
but a youth, but he is the centre of everything. He
orders everything, directs everything, is everything,
whereas lam not allowed to do anything at all.” That
expression of His Royal Highness’s justifies a hope that
there is in him sufficient aspiration after higher things to
make it worth while to utilise the Heir-Apparent in the
service of the Empire.
Pity Mr. Stead cannot see anything justifica-
tory in the assertions and aspirations of the two
men he so frantically inveighs against and
whose offences cannot be worse than those of
the Royal thing of whom his defender says that
the “ mistakes, follies, and sins of his earlier
life form a dark background which to some
affords plausible reason for thinking ill of the
most innocent of his diversions.
* * *
Let us conclude this note on Mr. Stead’s
“ Plea for the Prince ” by a quotation from an
article, also presumably from his pen, which
appears also in the July number of the Review
of Reviews. It is called “ Cromwell and his
Independents; or, the Pounders of Modern
Democracy.” It shows the chameleonic many-
sidedness of the modern keeper of the non-
conformist conscience. After defending a
Prince, putting up a prayer for the continuance
of monarchy and aristocracy, and demanding
the establishment of an Imperial form of Govern-
ment in order to supply a royal ass with work
which would keep him out of mischief, the Dan.
O’Connor of cheap journalistic enthusiasm
writes; —
The prelates and the princes, the swashbucklers and
the bravoes, will survive. But they will go under. The
future is not with those who seek to set up again the
dead past upon its throne. It lies with the men of
stronger faith and clearer insight, who first saw in the
simple Christian polity of the New Testament Church the
clue to the solution of the difficulties of the modern state.
In other words, Mr. Stead here tells us that if
we want to go ahead we must knock Princes
and nincompoops on the head. That’s so, and
we intend to do it every time. This is doubt-
less what Stead really believes ; we wonder
what was the inducement held out to him to
take a brief to whitewash the Prince of Wales !
The Lawyers’ Trade Union.
Bear Bulletin, —Looking at the thing all-
round I don’t quite see how the general public
is going to get much benefit out of the amalga-
mation of the legal profession, if Crick’s Bill
becomes law in N.S.W., beyond the fact that
Crick and other non-barristers blessed with the
gift of advocacy will then be able to lift up their
voices in the Supreme Court. The principle of
the Bill is good so far as it goes, because theo-
retically it widens the range of choice of the
man who wants a lawyer to put his case before
a jury. It is a step in the direction of abolish-
ing all restriction, and allowing an individual
with a lawsuit to have it treated, if he likes, by
the cheapest man he can get, lawyer or no
lawyer. (This seems to open up the way for a
few remarks on the subject of freedom of con-
tract, but I refrain.) Practically, however, it
seems to me that amalgamation will leave things
pretty much as they are. To begin with, you
can’t abolish the specialist in law any more
than in medicine, and you don’t want to, at any
rate so long as the law is a maze of such
heartbreaking complications as at present.
Anyone who makes his mark by working
his Jaw in Court would stick to that particular
line of business, for the simple reason that it
will pay him to stick to it, and it wouldn’t pay
him to turn to some other line where people
don’t want him so much. Whether the nominal
distinction between the barrister and solicitor
is kept up or not, there will always be a practi-
cal distinction between the man whose chief
occupation is collecting coin from his clients for
talking to them, and the one whose chief occu-
pation is collecting it for talking to jurymen or
a Judge. The big barrister with a persuasive
style of cross-examination and a bulgy fee-book
Won’t waste half a morning giving three
guineas’-worth of advice in person to a talkative
client, while two or three solicitors are waiting
for him in the passage with fifty-guinea briefs.
He can’t afford to do it. People seem to think
that he will go into partnership with a solicitor.
Hut that wouldn’t pay the barrister in a large
Way of business. All the other solicitors would
take their work away from him, and he would
be exchanging briefs from nearly every firm ni
the city for the briefs of one solitary firm.
# * *
On the other hand, the big solicitor can t
afford to go into court, because the bulk of his
business depends on personal interviews with
clients, and he has to stop in his office to see
them. If he conducted one client’s case in per-
son, he would have to neglect the business of
ftbout twenty others, who would promptly take
their custom to an solicitor who
Would give it his personal attention. He
Wouldn’t go into partnership with a barrister,
because he couldn’t get a tip-top man to go into
partnership with him, and nobody else would
Clients with large si/ed jobs want the pick
of the bar, and they wouldn’t put up with a
second-rate man merely because he was their
solicitor’s partner. Besides, if the barrister
were of only second-rate standing, it would be
cheaper for the solicitor to hire him as he was
wanted and pay him by the piece, than to keep
him on the premises and give him a big salary
or a share in the business.
* # #
Of course with solicitors or barristers who
don’t do much business the case is different.
The few clients they get they can attend to,
and they can find time, so far as that is con-
cerned, to do all that is to be done in a case in
court or out of it. If they do it well, and dis-
tinguish themselves, the chances are they will
get business, and sooner or later they will have
to choose between one branch and the other. No
busy man can attend to both. Perhaps it will be
an improvement that the separation of the two
branches of the profession will take place on
the lines of natural selection and the survival of
the fittest, but anyone who thinks that amalga-
mation is going to do away with the separation
altogether is not in it. The only lawyers who
will be able to do double duty will be young
beginners and unsuccessful men.
• * *
So far as experience in other places shows,
the change isn’t likely to cheapen law much
either. But it leads the way to a little further
change that might have that effect. If Parlia-
ment passes the Bill, it will be an admission
that barristers are competent to do solicitors’
work, and that solicitors are competent to do
barristers’ work. Now, anyone who wants to
qualify as a barrister is compelled to pass a lot
of examinations in dead languages, history,
mathematics, Roman law, constitutional law,
and other lumber before he is allowed to show
whether he knows enough Australian law to be
fit to practice. A solicitor is not required to do
all this. If Parliament admits that a barrister’s
work can be done by a man who hasn’t gone
through this particular grind, then it must
admit that the grind is absolutely unnecessary,
and ought to be abolished. Again, nobody
is put on the roll as a solicitor unless
he has served a long term of apprenticeship in
a solicitor’s office—three years in the case of a
University graduate, and five years in other
cases. If the barrister who hasn’t served this
apprenticeship is, nevertheless, qualified to set
up as a solicitor, it is a proof that the said
service is another ancient, useless relic that
should be swept away.
* * *
In point of fact, Mr. Crick’s Bill, as it stands,
is a virtual assertion that the only qualification
that any man ought to lie asked to show before
being allowed to practise in New South Wales,
either as a solicitor or at the bar, is the posses-
sion of a competent knowledge of the law in
force in New South Wales. That could be
ascertained by a simple examination, without
any service of articles or other prohibitory
probation. Now, while Parliament is about it,
why can’t it say that in so many words ? The
question of law-costs would soon settle itself
under the benign of good, healthy
competition. —Y ours,
BUSH LAWYER.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
In Camera.
What is the exact process by which a person
can get a divorce in secret in New South
Wales ? The Bulletin asks this question from
a soulful desire for information. It has ob-
served that some cases are heard with closed
doors in the early morning or in the solemn
hours of night ; and that others are heard
openly, and the gallery cackles with suppressed
glee when the barrister drags out from the
wretched co-respondent the tale of how he
serenaded his lady-love on the back-fence at
midnight. Then there is smothered laughter
over the evidence of the help who watched at a
key-hole and saw the parties hug each other, and
there are suppressed hysterics about the bad puns
of the humorist on the Bench, and then there is
a full report in all the evening papers and a
Bowdlerised report in the virtuous morning
paper, and in various other ways things are
made very unpleasant. How is it, then, that
some few suitors contrive to dodge this inflic-
tion, while the others supply joyous reading
matter for the women-folk '! Presumably money
and influence have nothing to do with it,,
for several people with no coin and very
little furniture, and no relations of any import-
ance, even down to the third cousin of the
Government dust-man, have got through on
this process. Possibly the way to arrange it is.
to hire the right barrister, and let him breathe
softly into the Judge’s ear on the subject; or,
possibly, it is all a matter of accident. Anyhow,
The Bulletin does not object to the individual
whose case is heard in camera (or heard early
“in open Court” but kept out of the law-list),
but it does object strongly to the individual
whose case is heard in public. Any man or any
woman can get lawfully married in profound
secresy, and there is absolutely no reason why
they should not be unmarried in the same
manner. A separation, like a marriage, is
(provided proper provision be made for the
children, if any) strictly the business of
the parties concerned. The law doesn’t
rush a prospective married couple into
the witness-box, and read over their
love-letters to a gaping multitude, and make
hideous puns about their prospects before
it allows them to be married, and there is no
earthly cause why it should do so before it
allows thorn to become un-married. The whole
trouble is a species of moral disease, but it is
the parties’ own disease ; and there is no more
reason why it should be treated in public than
there is why a hospital operation should be
performed hi a theatre, amid the cheers of the
excited public, and thus a malignant tumour be
turned into gate-money, and the surgeon take
a benefit on the strength of a thrilling abscess
in three acts, with an amputation for an
after-piece. Public morality, it is claimed,
demands that divorce proceedings should be open
to public inspection, but this reasoning proves
altogether too much; the individual who gets a
tumour may have got it in quite as sinful a
manner as the one who gets a divorce, and if
the one operation should be done in public so
also should the other. Also, the same theory
can be made to cover public hangings and a
good many other things equally offensive. Of
course, if any of the defendants demand a
public hearing they must have it; if the plain-
tiff declines the arrangement, she or he must go
without a divorce. But when all the parties,
as is usually the case, prefer secresy, it is
entirely their own funeral, and the public has
no more right to climb into another man s
divorce-case in search of information than to
climb into the same man’s bedroom for the same
purpose.
Civilisation.
Italy lias joined the other Powers in the measures that
are being taken to coerce China to extend protection to
foreigners. The American Secretory of State has
declared that though he received assurances from the
Emperor of China that he would grant redress tor the
outrages inflicted on American subjects in China, yet the
United States Government had determined to send every
man-of-war of the Pacific squadron to co-operate with the
vessels of the European Powers against China.— (Cable.)
According to latest statistics felo-de-se is boom-
ing in Austi’alia and the last half-year’s
suicides is considerably above the average. I* or
the second half of 1891 the prospects are also
good, and the ripe suicide is falling oft the tree
of life in large quantities. He is a delicate
fruit, and is greatly affected by climatic condi-
tions, but of late years the harvest has kept
much above previous averages. It is now
claimed by some authorities that Australia pro-
duces three times as much suicide in proportion
to population as the United States, and the
Melbourne Age gives way to tearful lamenta-
tion in a leading article upon the subject. For
our own part, we fail to see that the question
is of much importance. Where suicide arises
from poverty and sheer misery then it is the
business of the State to remove the cause of
the evil; but in a great number of cases it
is only the hurried exit of individuals who
have grown tired of the monotony of life
tired of money, and victuals, and bricks, and
drink, and tramcars, and civilisation generally
—who have grown to loathe the sight of their
own feet, and have given everything up for one
universal bad job. When a man gets so weary
as all this, he may as well die if he wants to.
Anybody has a right to die if he wants to. He
does no one any harm by it, and if he thinks he
is doing himself any good, he has every right to
make the experiment. He isn’t any deader if
he shoots himself than he would be if he
nerished of slow consumption, and a long list
of deaths by consumption is a vast amount
more objectionable than an equally long list
of deaths by self-destruction. The latter com-
plaint only cuts off those who want to die ; the
former generally takes those who do not want to
die. If consumption and cancer could be abolished
and the bills of mortality made up by more
suicides—so long as the latter did not arise
from want and misery—then The Bulletin
would consider that things were about square.
The people who wanted to die would be dead,,
and the people who didn’t want to die would be
left alive, and everything would be as satisfac-
tory as anybody could make it. It is no good
worrying about the death of the person who
wants to be dead. The suicide who isn’t dead
is a subject for lamentation, because he is a man
who has failed, and failure is always pathetic j
the dead suicide is all right*

The Victorian Government have successfully
prosecuted the promoters of a Melbourne art-
union lottery at a net loss of some £27. This
test case was tried before the St, Kilda bench,
composed of four honorary magistrates whose
sympathy with the defendants oozed out of
them all the time. In the end they found
themselves reluctantly compelled to assert the
majesty of the law by a five-shilling fine all
round and three guinea* costs against the secre-
tary of the art-union. This nominal fine was
sufficient under the circumstances, but the
refusal to allow more than a tenth of the
Crown’s costs was a palpable instance of how
mayors and councillors sitting on the judgment
seat are ever ready to assist their local friends,
or sons of their friends and acquaintances, at
the expense of public principles. But, perhaps,
the country ought to have known, as private-
individuals are constantly discovering to their
cost, that it is a suicidal policy to fight a strange
cock on his own local manure-heap. The
spectacle of Crown-Prosecutor Smyth, trying,
to convince the Solomons of St. Kilda that they
ought to be ashamed of themselves was pathetic
in its absurdity.
When diggers declare in the fiery North
That Chinamen must disappear ;
When down in the South the command issues
forth
That Australia’s a Caucasian sphere ;
When, over the seas, where the stars and stripes
throw
Their scowls at oppressions and frauds,
The mandate is heard that the Chinese must
go —
Then Civilisation applauds.
But when in the valleys of Hoonan arise
The voices of Mongols who say,
That the land of their fathers, its fields and its
skies,
Is theirs, shall be theirs from to-day ;
When daughters and mothers united appear
To stand by their fathers and sons
To drive out the foreigners —what do we hear?
Why Civilisation sends guns !
The Registry-Office Spiders.
Dear Bulletin, —Paradoxical as the fact may
appear, the agencies for the engagement of
labour increase everywhere in Australia with
the scarcity of employment. When work is
non-existent the registry offices are legion,
and the jobs they undertake to supply to all-
comers are innumerable. Yet, though 100 separate
billets are advertised in each window, and a crowd
of spirit-broken men hang round each door, evi-
dently waiting for billets of exactly that descrip-
tion, the men and the employment seem never to
come together. In one Sydney street alone, for in-
stance, there between 20 Mid 30of these establish-
ments, conducted usually by women. The observer
will presently learn, beyond the possibility of a
doubt, that three-fourths of the “institutes’
flourish upon ignorance and credulity, and that
some of them are nothing better than places of
assignation. The harpies in charge, when not
engaged in sweating a client, are standing
at the door, watching, with artificial smiles,
for fresh victims, for competition is particu-
larly keen at the present season of the year.
They greet the new-comer, especially if young
and green and feminine, with an oily grin and a
maternal aspect, but the harridan and Tartar
appear directly the client manifests obstinacy or
discontent on the spot cash question. There is
never any uncertainty about places after the appli-
cant has paid up. He or she is usually sent to an
employer with whom it is certain no servant will
stay for more than a week. Eight or ten are
frequently told off for one “job.” Of course, the
disappointed ones return, full of complaints, but
all the comfort they receive is a promise to look
out something equally suitable immediately.
“Will-1 return the registry-fee?” replied one
female to a crestfallen girl last w T eek. “ I should
think pot. indeed. How do you think this
establishment is kept up ? I send you to a place,
I am bound to give employers a choice, and if you
didn’t get it I’m sure it is not my fault. I will
look out something for you to-morrow.” If the
cheated client eventually gets a place, she will
have to pay a second fee. One of the chief
registry-offices in Sydney sends men regularly
week after week to a wood - and - coal
yard, where the hours of labour are 6
a.m. to 6 s p.m. The proprietor of this
yard finds fault with the new man at the end
of the day’s work, and dismisses him as a loafer
and declines to pay him any money. The unfor-
tunate employe, utterly destitute and friendless,
resorts again to the registry-office and receives—
the promise of a better job in the sweet by-and-
bye. This trick is good for the wood-and-coal-
man, and equally good for the registry-office-
keeper, the former getting a perennial supply of
labour for the value of two meals per man per
diem, and the latter the fees for introducing labour
to capital. There is a second wood-and-coal yard
situate in a marine suburb, the proprietor of
which is built on much the same plan. He
engages men at 15s. a week and their board, but
no one stays with him so long as one week, nor
waits for his wages. Some of the females in charge
of the registry-offices are undoubtedly procuresses,
while others are quite cognisant of the fact that
their premises are the recruiting-grounds of pros-
titution. Women of known infamous character-
may be seen in the waiting-rooms, ostensibly in
quest of servants, but in reality in search of.
unsophisticated girls to inveigle them into
brothels. Many months ago it was elicited
that a female keeper of a registry-office was in
the habit of letting a hay-loft to some half-
dozen girls, all under the age of 16, for sleep-
ing purposes. They paid 3s. a week each for the
use of this roosting-place, access to which was
gained by a ladder. She should have been awane
how these unfortunate waifs gained a living. The
harpies are notoriously in league with the worst
sweating dens among the fourth-rate cookshops
and restaurants, for the supply of waitresses,
kitchenmen, and cooks who, owing to the tyranny
to which they are subjected, seldom remain a
week. Half the notices of places in the registry-
office windows are extracted from the daily papers.
Suppose a railway contractor advertises for 60
men, the harpy sticks in her window a notice that
100 navvies are wanted, and to “apply within.
She has meanwhile written to the contractor in-
timating that the “ office ” knows of suitable men,
and requests permission to send them along. Of
course the contractor acquiesces. Thus, men
walk into the spider’s web, and pay their 10s. for
employment which they could just as easily have
got by going straight to the works. They only
discover the swindle when they have paid the fee.
The same practice of pirating the bi lets adver-
tised in the press is carried on wherever the
address of the employer is given. The harpy is as
cruel as she is unscrupulous. A decent, elderly
woman was sent, the other day, on a 300 miles
sea-voyage for a situation which had been already
filled from the same establishment. To her grief
and dismay she found that there was no opening
of any kind, and on returning to Sydney she
demanded a refund of the fee paid, together with
the costs of her journey. In honeyed phrase she
was told that a refund was “irregular and con-
trary to the rules of the institute,” and having no
money to invoke the aid of the law the poor
creature has to put up with the loss. To show
that these bloodsuckers are conscious of their
“soaliness,” it may be mentioned that a member
of the Trades and'Labour Council sailed straight
into a “Home” the other day, alid terrified
the -scoundrel in charge into disgorging 10s.
which ihe had obtained from a poor fellow on
the ipromise to find him a situation. The' average
registry-ikeeper has a face of brass and a heart of
iron. She is a parasite ot the worst order, living
on the miseries and necessities of her kind, and it
is high time that her iniquities were ended by
the introduction of a Government Labour Bureau,
having branches in various parts of the city and
suburbs.—Yours, etc.,

In Liverpool (N.S.W.) Asylum there are
nearly 1000 patients, most of them quite infirm,

only asylum doctor, it appears, is allowed (and
enjoys a large) private practice, and this in the
face of the fact that there are over 300 patients in
the asylum hospital.
The New York state officials announce—as
a conclusive proof of the suddenness of death by
electricity—that one of the last batch of prisoners
was making a remark when the operator turned
on the current, and the electric fluid struck him
so violently right in the middle of a word that he
went off to a better land leaving it unfinished.
Therefore, it is inferred that electrocution is
noi a slow process of cremating the living offender,
and that his end is painless and instantaneous.
Somehow the argument looks rather thin. If the
word was a long scientific term a man might
reasonably leave it unfinished, though he died of
consumption or old age. And even if it was a
word of one syllable a man who feels all at once
that he is being frizzled alive has his mind
•distracted a good deal and hasn’t much attention
to give to extraneous observations. If the prisoner
bad been walloped to death he would have broken
that word off short all the same, simply because
his attention would have been distracted by the
walloping. Execution is a thing that takes up
the whole of a person’s attention ; he is so busy
becoming a mangled corpse that he has no leisure
for anything else. Therefore, despite this new
evidence, Thk Bulletin' adheres to its old con-
viction that death by electricity is a failure, and
if New York was even the beginning of a civilised
state it would chloroform its murderer and then
, kill him in ajhumane manner with a hoe.

846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney, Sept. 9,1891.
M y Dear Moorabinda, —
There has been a tremendous revolution in the servants’
hall of a certain establishment in Sydney-the chatelaine
having ukased that hereafter she will employ nobody hut
ladies (of the nursery-governess-lady-help-cheap-music-
teacher brand) as domestics in her “menagerie.” They
are paid and treated as the ordinary slipshod Mary Ann—
hut the strict proviso is that they are not to recognise
any former acquaintances chancing to visit their mistress.
A gentleman got rather a shock at a house the other day,
when the door was opened to him, for the first time, by a
pretty girl, a friend of his. “ What! you here?” “Hush!”
she said, laying a cautious finger on her lips, “ you must
not remember me !”
Charming though it must be to get away from nursery-
governessing in pokey families to parlormaiding in large
ones, it is just possible that this innovation will fall
gently through after a hit, hut the hirelings won’t he the
first to find fault with it, I’ll wager. The nice-looking,
well-mannered girl w 7 ho ordinarily doesn’t get a chance at
the gilded Johnnie” will gladly embrace the lovely
opportunity—and, if she looks pretty in a cap, and has to
let him out after dinner—well, there really is no telling
how such things come about. There would be something
appealing in a real lady with pathetic eyes dusting the
furniture in an educated manner and announcing your
name in a far-away voice, and most men—while the idea
is new for a certainty—will find their eyes following the
movements of the lady-housemaid, “ Pitying the poor
soul, bai Jove !”—see if they don’t. And as real young
ladies do not always coldly refuse masculine sympathy
and have been known to sometimes work a clever
connubial trick or two, there are likely to be one or two
prizes in stove for the philanthropists who recruit their
kitchens from the Governesses’ Home.
But (harping on the lady servant plan now on trial) if
it becomes a general thing, how about Miss Bridget
Murphy? Biddy has been saucy, and has threatened to
unionise and have every night out, but yet I wouldn’t
like to see her superseded. For she has more pluck
than “lady” domestic? will ever have, and will fight
cheerfully to keep the wage-rate up and secure a reason-
ably good time for herself as these shame-faced girls
never would. Just as clerks won’t go in for a low, vulgar
trades-unionism, so tiie lady slavey will politely acquiesce
in anything just hecauseitis her nature to. No “servants’
union ’ for the housemaid-daughter of some dead-and-
gone doctor or parson: she will straighten her shabby
shoulders and politely murmur something about being
“only too happy to meet Mrs. Blank’s wishes” as the
once more omnipotent mistress knocks sixpence a week
off her wages “ only for the summer, Parker.”
An Australian vice-regal lady’s dire threat to serve only
pop-waters to slake the thirst of her female visitants
because of their scandalous partiality tor the sparkling
glass, evidently wasn’t in going order at a very recent
gubernatorial sociality, at which (I am told) one or two
society butterflies liberally over-estimated their carrying
capacity, with the result that their carriages were sharply
sent for. Rumour has it that the obfuscation of these
culprits was quite a different thing from the common or
garden hip-hip-hoorayishness of the ordinary champagne
girl who betrays her mental haze to the uninitiated by
the hilarious way in which she goes wrong in the Lancers
and the fishy glare in her flushed eye as she hangs over
her partner’s shoulder—all mere girlish fun to the latest
behaviour of these latest feminine Tosspots, one of whom
went the length of playfully aiming a champagne-glass at
somebody’s head!
Which reminds me that the Sydney ladies’ rendezvous
for getting lemonade with a bead on it has largely
altered from a Pitt-street cafe to a swell bathing-house.
But everyone who goes in doesn’t go in to wash—at least
not externally. Some of the less open-and-ahove-board
visitors conscientiously plod through the hot and cold
water to get to the whisky, but the old crusted variety
just cut the bath right out of it and go straight for the
reviver. There is a whisk into a dressing-room with a
wink of the other eye, followed by a gentle tap on the
door, and in comes a tray with a teapot on it (perhaps).
A “young man ” announces in the morning paper that
he “ wishes to communicate with young lady with means;
genuine.” Of course it’s the means which need to be
genuine-not the girl. She may have two wooden legs
and a wig aggravated by artificial teeth, and a glass eye,
but that isn’t of the slightest consequence. Any well-
regulated young man would overlook anything like that
provided her income was well and hearty. As one might
beautifully and pathetically put it: —
Talking about advertisements, the little prayer which
appeared recently in the morning papers imploring
“Lady Student” to make another appointment, caused a
wide grin among the naughty undergrads, at Sydney
University. For a bit of waggery a scented, gilt-edged
“ scrap of paper,” signed “Lady Student,” was sent to
the victim appointing a meeting at a dim twilight hour in
the ’Varsity Park. Prompt to the semi-second the eager
swain turned up, but instead of being welcomed by the
soft dalliance of an unknow n Minerva, was received with
a shower of flour-bags from ambuscaded jokers. However,
it takes more than a bag of flour to smother the average
undergrad.’s unshakeable faith in his own irresistible
fascinations.
A Vegetarian Society has sprouted in Sydney, to the
great joy, no doubt, of the Chinese gardeners. Vege-
tarians generally are quasi-hygienics-cum-religiosos,
though I suspect most of the women who swear to con-
form to the cabbage menu are actuated by a tender
yearning after a boiled-pork pallor and alabaster hands
rather than rude and glowing health. From a bird’s-eye-
view of the subject a grass diet is not more hygienic than
meat three times per day, judging by visible results. The
typical vegetarian is a damp, flabby, pasty-faced person-
age who neither smokes nor drinks wine, and fanatically
adheres to a whole lot of isms. Because he hasn’t the
digestive vigour necesjary to assimilate a chop, he holds
that chop up to public contempt; and because he hasn’t
enough physical “ go ” left in him to stick his chest out
and walk off the consequences of a pound of beefsteak, he
considers beefsteak as another name for the graveyard.
Whenever a woman solemnly renounces beef, you may
he almost sure she is on a complexion-hunt—though it is
quite an open question if she will turn out an “ alabaster
angel” in the long run. Rice is a vegetable supposed to
whiten the cuticle, but how about Ah Sin’s blushing
cheek, the colour of his boot soles ? Still, it is his
staple of diet. Yet some women give up being carnivora,
not for their cheeks' sake, hut because they have studied
the thing too deeply. I knew one girl who forswore
meat for the rest of her life, simply because she once saw 7
a greasy-haired butcher carry a slaughtered sheep into a
shop in the approved fashion—its gory forelegs held
round his neck ; another fled to bread and radishes
because she encountered a butcher’s mixed-up tray, and
I have heard of a girl who has eaten no meat since
witnessing the untrammeled cavortings of a mongrel
around a butcher’s block. But, after all, if you will allow
yourself to become morbid over such matters, there is
only starvation left. Who, for instance, would crisply
order lunch in a cafe, if she began to figure out all the
possibilities ?
Cardinal Moran has evidently never learnt what some
youths call the “barn-darnce,” or else he wouldn’t put his
foot down so hard on eleemosynary out-breaks set to
time. His last “bull” extinguishes Tempe Refuge ball
forever—or until a waltzing Cardinal comes along—his
reason being (let me whisper it behind my little hand)
that as Tempe Refuge is for fallen sisters who perhaps
attribute their troubles to hall-room influences, it is not fit-
ting that the probable bane should also he the antidote—
see ? Therefore, the last Tempe ball was the final one of a
long series. It wasn’t largely attended, and the “gate”
hadn’t to be shunted home on a wheelbarrow 7 —therefore
the Cardinal’s ukase strikes one as having its full share of
commercial expediency, after all.
An English friend writes me that bizarre dresses were
the order of the day at Goodwood. Some of them were
in truth real startlers. Fancy a costume of blue and
yellow striped silk, with a bright green waistcoat, and
this topped by an enormous Leghorn hat covered with
ostrich feathers! There w 7 as also a green foulard w 7 ith
pink spots, worn with a tiny bonnet composed of pink
roses. The wearer was uncommonly good-looking.
Another striking creation w 7 as of tulle, with pink and
yellow 7 roses dotted over it, worn over a green silk petti-
coat. This was accompanied by a very wide-brimmed
straw hat lined with yellow and pink flowers and trimmed
with roses of every hue known to horticulture. Even this
extraordinary rig-out did not look half as had as one
would think from the description. I hope to see it at
Randw'iok meeting.
Not long ago, the utterly impossible mother of a
wealthily-married Sydney Hebe, sw 7 anned into a little
shanty opposite the daughter’s mansion, and hung a
notice on the gate—“ Washing done here by Mrs. Blank’s
mother!” The young lady has now bought the old lady
off.
The happy heir to the Moss money, over which they
litigated so lately in the Melbourne Courts, has just come
into the whole of it through the death of his father. Mr.
Moss, junior, followed the business of a mercantile broker
in Sydney, and had just done what would technically he
described as a “good deal in whisky” when the news
reached him. Besides the estate, he comes into a per-
petual annuity of £5OO a year granted to grandfather
Moss and his heirs after him. It is sometimes a great and
paying thing to have a grandfather.
Gov. Jersey had a colicky time of it at the Horticultural
Show the other day. At the fruit-tables generous chips
w 7 ere sliced off gigantic apples, and I am sure his Ex-
must have inwardly murmured Fluellen's “Must I eat?”
as they pressed each sample upon him. An excellent
vice-regal accomplishment would be the art practised on
the stage of putting food into your mouth and finding it
up your sleeve.
On dit the reason why a recent club-warming hall was
so formal was that a strict rule limiting the ladies to
“ wives or daughters of members ” was enforced, and con-
seqentiy the gay and untrammelled Johnnie, who didn’t
own either, couldn’t introduce some charming being as
his “ sister” in the old, glad way, and the festivities went
lame in consequence. Under the liberal heading of
“ female relations ” a man can get a card tor anybody if
he wants to, since any girl will do as a cousin or a well-
preserved aunt, but to represent a wife is rather a dif-
ferent matter. A man may have a battalion of female
relatives, hut he must produce only one wife.
St. Vincent’s Hospital hall will be held in Centennial
Hall on 14th inst. (during race week). Messrs. Hughes
and Freehill are hon. secs., and as half the people one
meets signify their intention of attending, a good “ gate ’’
should result.”
The spring hall given by the Jerseys eventuated at
Government House on 4th inst., and wasn’t a great
dancing success, owing to the sultry, thunderous nature
of the evening. The vice-regal hostess was nicely
arrayed in ivory-white texture with diamond additions,
and the rooms were florally decorated, though a dado of
blocks of ice and punkahs would have better fitted the
occasion, me thinks. Yet another vice-regal hop will have
happened ere this appears in print.
“Nobody” went out to TattersalTs race-meeting on the
sth owing to the unmistakeable weather, and the meeting
was simply a blank as far as dressing went, i am told. All
the Saturday excitements suffered from the wet. The
half-crown ferry-boats that were to rush down to the
Heads to see the “Squadron” come in at 4 p.m., were
patronised most by the captain and his attendant deck-
sweep artistically arrayed in bright canary oilskins witli
a damp band crowding round the furnace, though as the
fleet (mostly ugly Orlando replicas) got in hours before
advertised time, it is just possible these damp amphibia
didn’t have to put to sea.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH,
lb is untrue that there is a serious split in
the S.A. Labour-party, although considerable
difference of opinion certainly does exist as to
the definition of the term “wage-earner.” The
narrow construction put upon the term by the
party has debarred some of its ablest champions
from receiving parliamentary nomination.
“ Weep not for hair of golden hue
And eye of soft and sapphire blue ”
(Quoth rich mamma one day.)
“ Your pa and I are plain to view,
And you are ‘ interesting,’ too,
As flatterers would say.
But better far than golden locks
Are bonds and shares and scrip and stocks
To gain rapt love on earth—
And all the men—he who they may—
Will worship your nez retrousse
When they know what you’re worth.”

“Twenty Minutes Under an Umbrella ”
introduced Edward Sass and Emma Gwynne
(Mrs. Sass) to a Sydney Criterion audience, who
warmly received them, on Saturday night last,
and raised the curtain ok a very beautiful wood-
land scene. The object of this trifle is to repre-
sent a lovers’ quarrel and subsequent engage-
ment, but it is scarcely attained, for the lines are
not so consistently silly as to be habitually
clever and harmoniously natural. Nevertheless,
the morceau was followed by a little ripple of
laughter pervaded by an occasional guffaw, and
the artists got a big call on curtain-fall. The
author’s name is withheld for no apparent reason.

“ Devotion ” is not a particularly good nor
particularly well acted play. Its aims are high,
but the author falls short of his object, princi-
pally in consequence of a want of definiteness, a
lack of consistence and continuity in the
characters, and because the more interesting
events take place elsewhere and are conveyed to
the audience by means of dialogue always bright
and snappy, but usually bereft of good excuse for
its introduction. As an instance, it is not
necessary to the plot that the Abbe de Condi
(played now, as at the London Court production
of ’B4, by the author) should be about to divorce
the Church in order that he may espouse a wife,
and his conduct in lightly blackening the reputation
of Marie de Chevreuse, his Genevieve’s lady friend,
is contrary to human nature. As for the acting, all
the performers are modern in manner and move
awkwardly in the doublet and hose of the period.
On opening night they all “fluffed” dreadfully,
though this may have been caused by the accident
to the mail, which delayed their arrival. Mrs.
Brough, who was enthusiastically received, seemed
much incommoded by her lengthy court train,
and, here and there, gabbled her lines—as did
Percy Lynda!, who looked like the prints of
Charles II. —in a most meaningless fashion.
Titheradge was good in the comedy scene at
the close of the second act and strong in the
third act, but apparently ill at ease in his finery,
while his speech at times, like that of Dot Bouci-
cault, was pervaded by a soupjon of the Irish
accent. Arthur Lawrence made the most of his
silhouette of a soldier, but none of the characters
are flesh and blood ; they are mere phantasmagoria
that come and go, leaving no footprints on the
sands of time or impression on the memory of the
audience. The best feature of the show is the
scenery, particularly an interior in the Louvre,
painted by Messrs. Spong and Churchward.

feet of ice-cold water and swim twenty yards

the while convulsively to a batten) from a watery
tank. Audiences will probably continue to be
large until “The Dancing Girl” comes along

ski]) this way, and Melbourne seems likely to have
all the best of the exchange. “ The Babes in the

“The Ambassador,” a dramatisation by
Phillips and Grundy of the former’s novel, “The
Daughter of the Dean,” is the story of a hypo-
critical, fleshpot-loving parson (Charles Cart-
wright), who sells his lovely and innocent daughter
(Olga Nethersole) to a broken-down rake who
neglects her. She then has a tenderness for a
lovely and rich young man (Cosgrove), whose
appeals for elopement she withstands, but
who, being caught under suspicions circum-
stances by her husband in her hotel sitting-
room, whence he (the lovely one) had just
expelled a more importunate and less scru-
pulous admirer, a Russian prince (Lawrence
Cautley), is made co-respondent in a successful
divorce-suit. The wronged lady then adopts
an assumed name and the protector of distressed
damsels, seriously wounded in duel with the
Russian ravisher, temporarily becomes “dotty.”
Meantime the divorcee becomes the pen see of
another Lord (Harry Diver), whose ma (Jenny
Watt-Tanner) is about to wed the authors’ high-
class Chadband-Stiggins-Aminadab-Sleek. This
individual, apparently out of sheer cussedness,
reveals his daughter’s “shameful past,” and his
denunciations are backed up by those of the
wicked old husband who, likeZouroff, in “Moths,”
is supposed to have had a feminine reason
for divorcing his too painfully spotless wife. The
much-maligned female then releases the lordling
from his promise, and prepares to wander forth
alone, slowly and sadly, down this vale of tears,
.Inst then the co-respondent, who has been seeking
her vainly for years, bursts in, she madly shrieks
“George!” he throws his arms round her, ex-
claiming “ My wife !” and the curtain falls.
* * *
“ The Ambassador'’ is far from being a
bad play, and is very ably handled; its chief
weakness lies in its somewhat feeble conclusion.
The comedy is supplied by a giddy gusher,
nightly played by Mary Kingsley, the dod-
dering army dude of Fred Neebe, and the
wicked, little, French maid of Nellie Lyons.
Cartwright is at his best in “character,” therefore
his dean, an impossible, crawling snob, is more
attractive than anything he has done since “ The
Middleman,” and Miriam, a kindred soul to the
Vere of “Moths,” sitslightlyon the shoulders of the
lady star. This play is right up to date, Cosgrove
—he can’t make love worth a cent —remarks that
“ Marriage is the only contract binding for life by
law” and so on. Cautley’s Russian is somewhat
too noisy in passion but effective, and Harold
Russell’s peer of the realm is an unmitigated cad.
Other folks are equal to small opportunities'.
Calls are now taken at this house before the
curtain, except by “the stars” who take the
centre of the stage and have the rag rolled up.
“ The Ambassador ” would probably draw as well
as anything else for a fortnight, but it is intended
to devote next week to revivals while “ The
Village Priest” is being licked into shape. The
Darrells take up the running in three weeks.

“ lolanthe,” put up for six nights only,
has quite revived biz., at Sydney Royal. Nellie
Stewart, Leonora Braham, Benharn, and other old
favourites identified with this tender and tuneful
tale are much missed, but their successors are by
no means bad substitutes, and the whole opera
although laden with the odours of old-time
memories, has the breezy freshness of new-mown
hay. Charles Ryley’s Strephon has been uni-
versally pronounced to be the feature of the per-
formance, though Elsie Cameron’s Fairy Queen,
from a vocal standpoint chiefly, is also a big
success. Henry Braoy, now in very good voice, is
a good if languid Mountararat; Syd. Deane’s
Tolloller is about his best up to date, and Grundy’s
Private Willis isn't half bad. Flora Graupner
and Violet Varley are just about as good as they
have been in anything else, though handicapped
by memories, as Phyllis and lolanthe ; and
Howard Vernon’s Lord Chancellor seems to have
improved with age. “ Absence makes the part go
stronger.”

In “Charity Begins at Home,” a musical
proverb by B. C. Stephenson and Alfred Cellier,
and another old favourite, Billy Elton’s extra-
ordinary charity boy, of course, has all the fat
and makes all the fun. With Ida Osborne, Elsie
Cameron, Lissant, and Rosevear in the cast this
trifle is stronger vocally than on prior occasion,
and it whizzes along as merrily as a fat man down
a buttered slide. The London Gaiety Company
open on Saturday in “ Ruy Bias, or the Blase
Roue,” which will be followed by “ Cinder-
Ellen.” Frank Emery is already busily engaged
on “The Forty Thieves ” for Christmas.

Someone wants to know why folks usually
like best the first-seen personation of any
character." Chiefly, because the character is after-
wards insensibly clothed with the individuality of
its first impersonator, -supposing that such per-
sonality does not too obviously clash with the
author’s conception. However, should the first
impersonator be incapacitated, mentally or physi-
cally, from conceiving or embodying the author’s
idea, then, a second and more worthy representa-
tive will have no difficulty in effacing any
impression left by the prior performance. As the
“ creators ”of parts, however, are usually selected
because of their peculiar fitness for their imper-
sonation —if, indeed, in these modern days, the
parts be not purposely written for them—
“ original ” performances are, as a rule, the best,
and inevitably become afterwards the standard of
comparison.

“Jane,” that wild, disordered narrative
of what may happen to a parlourmaid on the
modern stage, received a red-hot welcome at
Melbourne Bijou on Saturday night. The reasons
that compelled “Jane’s” success in Sydney are
tolerably certain to operate with equal vigour
upon the Melbourne mind, for cne touch of
naughtiness makes the whole of the kawlinies kin,
and there are several incitements to blush in the
course of this three-act shriek. Not that “Jane’s”
morals are other than irreproachable, by any
means. She is merely just naughty enough to ho
nice, and will stand the scrutiny of any Social
Purist who may come boring a hole through the
back of the dress-circle with his little gimlet. The
adventures of this much-married maid-servant
were recently told at length in The Bulletin,
and they haven’t altered for the worse in the
meantime. Her laughing eye is still fixed on the
main chance, which is a milk-run, and she con-
tinues to be hugged by her young master and his
gloating nunky in the interests of everybody in
general, and the valet in particular, until the
latter martyr gets tired of trying to contain his
feelings, and explodes with aloud report. “Jane”
has no dramatic purpose, except to prove that a
brand-new husband can’t reduce himself to filling
the coal-scuttle and answering the front-door bell
whilst his bride is tapping a bald-headed inter-
loper with a spoon. As a lesson in human nature,
the revolt of William Tipson is superfluous. No
loving husband on earth has ever been able to
occupy the first hours of the honeymoon in watch-
ing his partner for life fall upon the chest of a
giddy bachelor, or encourage an amorous nunky
to sip nectar from her lips. When the object of
affection is built on the lines of Pattie Browne the
mere thought of such a conjugal experiment
becomes monstrous. One’s heart bleeds for
William all the evening. A change from the
Sydney cast is Anson in Lawrence’s former char-
acter of “ Uncle,” and the howling success of that
trusty institution can be taken for granted. Other
parts are filled as before. Pattie Browne is the
pretty Jane who never looks so shy, Cecil Ward
officiates as the father of a rag baby under false
pretences, Brough (somewhat heavy and careworn
in style) re-appears as the real husband, and Miss
Romer accounts for most of the remaining fun.
Also “Jane” is fitted with the same old suitable
interior, and the audience are fastened into their
places with “Hook and Eye.”

At the Royal the Laura Yilliers company
are slowly ebbing away in “Lost in London,” an
oft-tried melodrama by the late Watts-Phillips-
It is the old tearful story of the fair-haired frail
female, in humble circumstances, who leaves her
husband for a life of gilded sin and repentance
with a vile seducer, and her repentance is so
eternally wearisome that the vile person gets full
up of his bargain. After being turned loose upon
a cold world, the erring female totters back to her

Ostler Joe (a grimy miner who wears knicker-
bockers, in this instance) and dies. Sometimes a
lot of angels waft her upwards to the flies, but the
writer can’t say whether this ascension occurred
mi Saturday because he wasn’t in at the death, so
to speak. However, “ Lost in London ”is a well-
written melodrama anyway, and two or three of
the company cut a creditable dash amidst the woe.
They have the advantage of a Lancashire dialect
(stage version), which, as everybody knows, sounds
ruggedly pathetic to slow music. “ What ails
t’lass?” is a much more touching enquiry than
“ What’s the matter with the girl ?” although it
comes to the same thing in the end. Clifton
Alderson puts some life into the deserted hus-
band, and Miss Yilliers seems much less lost in
Australia than she has seemed on some previous
occasions. But it is painfully evident that several
of her satellites are dispirited and lack courage to
try and do their best, even if they have a best.
The present bill will last the season out, presum-
ably. It closes on the 19th, and two nights later
the fvignolds will come to the rescue in “ Merry
Wives of Windsor.”

Snazelle, assisted by his daughter, John

The Gaiety Company are giving their last
kicks before" full attendances at Melbourne
Princess’. They have worn so well through a ten-
weeks’ season that the management tried to work
an extension of their sparkling imbecility, but the
London manipulator of the sacred burlesque
lamp wired back —“Regret impossible; company
must sail 31-t October.” He doesn’t explain
whose regret is impossible, but the main fact
sticks out with awful distinctness. The deah
girls, and the two Fvveds- funny tiling there
should be two Fweds, doncherkuow—- must go.
It will be a terrible wrench for the wandering
Johnnies who can’t accompany them to Sydney as
camp followers, and a poignant grief for the
Toorak portion of “Burke’s Colonial Gentry.” Yet
such is life. To-night (Thursday) the bouquets
will fall thick at Nellie Barren’s feet, for she and
Leslie intend to honour the occasion with their
benefit. To-morrow there will be two farewell
performances to meet the wants of all classes,
and then the sacred lamp crosses the
Murray. “ The Late Lamented,” farcical
comedy, is to occupy the boards that fairy
feet have trod. A gratifying feature of this pro-
duction will be the reappearance of Maggie
Moore, and if that child of mirth, flanked by
Snazelle, Royce, Gourlay, Maggie Knight, Edwin
Kelly and other bright people, can’t make “The
Late Lamented ” hum—why that deceased indi-
vidual will be alone to blame.
&* * *
Meanwhile sassiety doesn’t '‘rally round
the Italian standard as it ought to, and the
ground floor of the Alexandra is the only properly
patronised part of the house. The uppah closes
may perhaps incline their hearts to grand opera
when they can’t get any more comic songs and
tights, because everyone speaks well of the present
Simonsen company. Signora Outtica’s rendering
of the “ mad ” airs in “Lucia de Lammermoor ”
has aroused a furore of applause, arid although
the mounting of the operas is unworthy of such
fine singing, it is absurd to charge the manage-
ment with the faults of people who don't come
along to support the best all-round musical enter-
tainment offered to them for many a long day.
“The Huguenots,” with Guidotti and Yilalta at
the head of affairs, was to go up on Tuesday, and
be played every night this week except Thursday,
when the Cutticas chip in again with “Lucia.”
“ Lohengrin ” comes next on the list, from which,
by the way, “Barber of Seville ” might very well
be left out. The company don’t shine in light
opera, and the funny basso is best in serious
situations. Moreover, subscribers —being mostly
bearded men with billiard-ball heads —don’t want
“The Barber ” in any case.

Mons. Wiegand succeeded in witching a
fair sized crowd with his Town Hall organ recital
on Saturday. The Melbourne folks are not mucli
wrapped up in their somewhat aged instrument,
however, and Wiegand’s sudden recall to Sydney
was not such a blow to them as some people
intended it to be.

Other shows are there as usual—Frank
Clark’s, the Victoria Hall, Cyclorama, and Wax-
works. At this latter establishment the prize
twins are dividing public favor with Colston’s
knife. Visitors may be noticed glancing from the
twins to the implement of destruction in a horribly
suggestive way.

“ May I ask if all the English actors who
have come over, and are now favourites here,
were successes from the first ?” said Laura Yilliers
in her sorrowful letter to the Agk. That question
can be promptly answered in the affirmative.
Titheradge took the town’s fancy right away.
Brough received good notices for his Tam-
bour Major, and shouts of approbation for his
second performance—the Lord Chancellor in
“ lolanthe.” Boucicault knocked ’em at the start
with his Harvey Duff in “The Shaughraun.”
Anson was immediately recognised as a first-class
artist, although his opening piece was a failure.
Elton was a prime favourite within five minutes
of making his bow in “ Blow for Blow.” Hand-
some Jarge, as Henry Vee, was idolised from the
Jump, and Brother William’s picture of the York-
shireman made an instantaneous impression.
Snazelle becairie a popular institution on the first
flight of “Paul Jones.” Amongst the resident
leading ladies, Kate Bishop had a triumphant
OlgaNethersole “ came off” in “Moths,”and Mrs.
Brough was reckoned uncommonly nice in comic
opera, even before she began to ascend the ladder
of public favour as a winsome comedy actress.
These are plain faets which annihilate the
ridiculous Villieresque assumption that English
performers have to overcome prejudice when they
lace Australian audiences. Two years ago Garner
sent over what was by no means a “star’’com-
pany from England. Being a fairly capable
crowd all-round, however, they were able
to play “ The Pointsman ” for five weeks to good
business, in the very theatre where Miss Villiers
& Co. have suffered such significant neglect since
their opening night. If this last comparison
doesn’t convince Miss V. she must be more
sweetly unreasonable than most of her sex. So
there now !
At Poverty Point.
A certain operatic artiste who not long ago “filed,”
now does Sydney in a private carriage and pair and a
livened coachman.
Dolly Hayes, a young lady of Sydney, for whom
musician Gus Kuster had fotsaken his wife and family,
woke up the other morning and found him pendant from
the bedpost. When she retired to rest Kuster was copy-
ing music, but he left a note, saying: “Goodbye, Dolly.
May I be the last you will drive to destruction, and may
this be a lesson to you, and also to all men that have any
dealings with you.” Kuster once led the orchestra at
Sydney Opera House, where he started Sunday night
conceits. One of his last Sydney appearances as conduc-
tor was at a variety-show in the since demolished Academy
of Alusic. The last time we heard of him he had just
escaped from Broken Hill in charge of a corpse, booked
to Adelaide, with five shillings and a free passage. Let
his ghastly death be an awful warning to those who start
Sunday concerts.
Bill “ Arrowsmith ” Ryan once had a curious experience
with Henry Neill Warner at the old Prince of Wales
Theatre in Lonsdale-street, Melbourne. The dressing-
room of the “ great tragedian ” was fitted up in the stage
box. Something went wrong and he flew, with tiger-hke
ferocity, at Bill, who, being somewhat of a dab with his
fists, defended himself with much spirit. The curtains
were torn down, and the contest was continued in full
view of the audience. Warner, however, proved the
victor, as, with a cross-buttock, he sent Ryan flying on to
the stage, where he gracefully bowed his acknowledge-
ments, to the ironical applause of the audience.
Remenyi, the violinist, is in America. Some of the
artistes who assisted at the concert he gave at Colonel
North’s would like him to be in England. His late agent,
Foster, after doing nothing for some time, is resting.
An Adelaide paper publishes something that looks
like the portrait of a young Alontenegrin soldier—a
handsome, smooth-faced boy in a regimental jacket of
barbaric splendour—and calls him Aliss Lily Dampier.
“ Jim ” M’Carthy, bill-sticker and bell-ringer of Gren-
fell, N.S.W., who has just joined the majority, arrived in
the district when the Weddin diggings—the original name
—first broke out. He was then connected with a travel-
ling theatrical company, but gave up roaming and
“ camped.” He was a good Shakesperian reader, could
tell some rare anecdotes of old times and people, was
given a little to practical joking, and was not as good a
water-drinker as 1.0.G.T. Clark could desire. However,
peace to his ashes.
“ Henry Irving seriously thinks about a trip to Aus-
tralia—you may take this on good authority,” says our
correspondent. “Everything, of course, depends on
what Ellen will do. You may also contradict any
interested rumours—set about by people who want to en-
gineer him—that any arrangements have been made. ’
So many mediocrities and impostors are now announc-
ing themselves in Europe as “Australian musicians”
that it is quite a pleasure to hear that Aliss Bessie Doyle,
who has been studying the violin in Leipsic for the last
few years, is really a genius. Her professor says he has
never had such a pupil, and adds that there are few
violinists before the public who can hold a candle to her.
Unfortunately, Miss Doyle is poor and has no influential
friends to help her in making a noisy debut in London,
and, therefore, she will have to depend upon her merits
in making her appearance. She is connected by mar-
riage, we hear, with rich TcmCadell, of N.S.W. Another
young Australian lady who is making good progress with
her musical studies in Germany is the daughter of Mr.
Middleton, the head of the Goulburn (N.S.W.) Telegraph-
office. Miss Middleton promises to have a distinguished
career.
“ Your very own Nellie Stewart,” writes our London
correspondent, “is definitely engaged to create the princi-
pal part in the new Gilbert-Cellier opera, which is to be
produced early in the coming season at the Prince of
Wales. I don’t think that the lady will be quite so
capricious in this instance as she was in the case of the
Nautoh Girl. Still, that little episode was not half a bad
advertisement for her. She has been a great deal talked
about since, and there is considerable curiosity to see
whether she is worth all the fuss which was made about
her. Nellie Stewart is one of the best-dressed women in
London, and her victoria is the cynosure of neighbouring
eyes in the Park, being one of the smartest turned out.
Pier diminutive “tiger” is the envy of everybody.
Where all the money comes from to keep up such style
would be a mystery, did we not know how wealthy the
average prima donna of opera-bouffe becomes in Aus-
tralia.”
“ Lucia ” is by far the greatest success of the Simonsen
Opera Co. The Cutticas go up top, but, oh, one wishes
they were not such a pair of bolsters. But ’twas ever so.
Fat and melody were wedded in the beginning of all
things.
The relations of John Rogers and Minnie Palmer are
now said to be on the strictest business footing: they call
each other “ Sir ” and “ Alum.” Alum’s the w ord.
It is persistently asserted by the British cablegrammer
that a certain beauteous creature’s career on the stage is
ended. According to the yarn, Abington Baird bought
her a splendid mansion at Regent’s Park (London), and
then came home one night to find her entertaining the
other fellow in the house which had cost so many
thousands of his legal tender. Further, the narrative
goes on to say that Baird dashed the other fellow down
the front steps, and then whaled the ex-society beauty,
and tramped on her bright countenance, disfiguring her
for life. When he got sober he squared the thing for
£25,000, but her small pink ear will never get shifted
back to its correct place, and her beauteous eye is off the
straight. This is the story that is going round New
York, and it is a remarkably good lie, and a respectable
advertisement.
Jim Byers is again on the war-path—this time at
Bathurst—with “The Dagworth Murder.” Jim is author
and hero.
David Christie Murray, who stigmatises Australians as
rowdy, is reminded by a contemporary that if they had
been very rowdy, they would not so calmly have accepted
that celebrated explanation of his when he kept them
waiting three-quarters of an hour for a lecture—that he
had fallen asleep after dinner at the “ kah-lub.”
Musical artistes are as vain as ever. British and foreign,
they are all alike. An unfortunate French musician
named Duvivier, composer as well as instrumentalist, had
fallen into great poverty, and his friends had organised a
benefit for him at a hall in Piccadilly. He was so poor
that he couldn’t pay the parish rates, and only the day
before his concert was charged at the police-court with
putting a revolver to the head of the bailiff who had come
to levy on his scanty effects. Amongst the vocalists who
had promised to sing at the concert were Maurel and Ben
Davies, an excellent tenor; but when the concert came
off both these men refused to appear because they had
not been “starred” in the bills. Fortunately Max O’Rell
happened to he present with his wife, and, sympathising
with his compatriot, Duvivier, he volunteered to give two
recitations in place of the two absent singers.
Like the wonderful success of Sara Bernhardt in Aus-
tralia, which no one foresaw, is the long run of “ L’ En-
fant Prodigue,” at the Prince of Wales Theatre, London.
No one expected it. In a season remarkable for its
theatrical failures, this drama without words had been
running for more than 160 nights when the last mail left,
and when several of the theatres had had to close. Many
people go to see the little French pantomime twice, and
the Princess of Wales went four times. Two Australian
managers have applied for the Australian right of the
piece ; but R. S. Smythe is doubtful it it would be a great
success in Australia. West-End audiences include a good
proportion of foreigners, who are fond of pantomime on
as well as off the stage ; and we have no leader of society
who, like the Princess of Wales, suffers from deafness,
and who therefore doesn’t care about dialogue.
Although Paderewski will not perform again in London
before October, seats for his recitals were being secured
in July.
Clifford Harrison is the only reciter who makes any
money in England, and he makes a lot.
R. S. Smythe, writing from London, says that if Henry
Stockwell had gone to England three years ago with Amy
Sherwin, lived quietly, and studied hard, he could now
command fifty pounds a week in England, so scarce are
good tenors.
Frank Bradley, the organist, who travelled as pianist
first with Santley and afterwards with Marian Burton’s
company through New Zealand, went to New York, but
is back in England, and would like to return to Australia.
This somehow reminds us, by the way, that it would make
Marian Burton sit up to see what the Yankee papers say
about her and the Waterlow.
In the Era, the Melbourne Theatre Royal is advertised,
rather unhappily, as “ the Drury Lane of the Australias.”
Old Drury has now a sound unmusical to Thespians’ ears.
Fred. Leslie maintains that no chestnut is too old to

“I don’t ask any poor man’s child to do anything n J'

Melbourne: “La Sonnamhula,” “Faust,” “Lohengrin,”
“ Ernani,” “Lucrezia Borgia,” “ Rigoletto,” “Norma,”

“Lost in London” fetches to mind Watts-Phillips, its
unlucky author, father of Miss Roland Watts-Phillips.
He was really clever, not only as dramatist, but also as
satirist, and as artist, witness that remarkable Punch
rival, Diogenes. His mischief was to fall into the clutches
of Adelphi Webster, who kept such splendid plays as the
“ Dead Heart ” and “ Lost in London ” on hand for long,
weary years, until “ Lost in London ” was actually stolen
making a hit in New York.
Chas. Warner is unlucky in stage accidents, and was
much injured by a recent fall of feen?ry on him, in
“ Drink”—the play, Drury Lane. Some years ago he got
hacked in “ Michsel Strogoff,” just as Darrell was in
“ Sunny South.” There’s such a thing as backsheesh, to
Props and Co., and who hasn’t heard of the men failing
to be behind the flip-flap to catch the poor clown ?
Photographer Falk has taken some photos, of the “Old

According to B. and 8., Alec. Alayne has not officially
announced the engagement of Mrs. Langtry. Should she
come along, however, she will probably avoid her last
London failure, “ Lady Barter,” and open in Grundy’s
“Esther Sandraz,” to be followed by “The Country
Girl,” “ She Stoops to Conquer,” and “ As You Like It.”
“ When Thou Art Near,” the sweet and tender ballad
written and composed by L6on Caron for Charles Ryley,
and sung by that tuneful baritone in “ The Old Guard,”

Galignani says that Mrs. Brown-Potter married Bellew
at Hong Kong, immediately on receipt of a cable from
New York announcing that her husband had secured a

According to commentators, the Shakesperean line—
“ For his nose was as sharp as a pin and a battled o’ green
fields,” should read : “For his nose was as sharp as a pin
on a table of green frieze.”
The lately-jugged histrions aver that the juggee hadn’t
the rights of the play that caused the trouble until a late
date, and that they are prepared to pay him a royalty of
three guineas for their every performance of it since he
became possessed of these rights. Aleantime, an action
of £lOOO for unauthorised use of play, &c., is pending,
and of £5OOO on the other side for malicious imprison-
ment.
Gladys Evelyn, the actress, “ deserted and betrayed ” by
Journalist Hurlbert, has been telling her tale of woe by
means of a lecture, badly written and very well read, to
London audiences, at the Royal Aquarium. She states
that she met her seducer, “ one of the six best talkers in
London,” and a man who never smokes because he
believes that “ the cigar stays the kiss,” while riding “ in
an honest British’bus in the gloaming of a winter after-
noon,” and that, “not being a slave to these austere rules
of British prejudice,” she at once listened to his tale of
love and prompt offer of marriage.
A Sydney man writes a letterto the Pam. Alall Gazette
in which he states, in reference to the refusal of Lady
Jersey to attend a ..“Doll's House” matinde given by
Janet Achurch in aid of Sydney Women’s College, that
the lady, when refusing her patronage, “ stated that from
what she had heard of Ibsen she had no wish to witness
one of his plays.” He also states that Lady Jersey’s letter
contained “a very cruel and gratuitous insult to Janet
Achurch about the impossibility of the actress who could
play such a piece being a lady.” He concludes by saying
that: “The Governor’s wife came to us with the reputa- '
tion of being an intellectual and broad-minded woman ;
but an act such as the one mentioned goes far to shake
that reputation.” Why didn’t they publish Lady Jersey’s
letter, instead of mere fragments of it, so as to put both
sides before the public ?
Anyone who wants to get square with a man who plays
a wind-instrument in public can do it by sucking a lemon
in front of him—that is, if the eminentjrhorn-blower is at
all sensitive on the subject of acids. This dodge was
discovered by a man who pined after the beauteous
daughter of a flute-obligato person, and who was roused
to frenzy by the violence with whicli (lie flute man cast
hint out and blighted his young affections. He took a
front seat and a huge green lemon at the next great con-
cert, and lay low with thunder and poison in his soul.
Then the flute-blower started his great performance in
B flat, and in the midst of it his enemy began to cough,
and having arrested the musician’sattention, proceeded to
chew the lemon with a loud, chumping, swallowing noise,
and to spill the juice all over the place, and to make
hideous grimaces. The great artist’s mouth go 1 - out of
shape on the instant, and with a wild, discordant wail,
and a snort in C or thereabouts, he fled from the stage.
Next day he caved in, on the express understanding that
his son-in-law would never bring fruit to the theatre so
long as he lived. What The Bulletin wants to know
now is how many lemons it would take to disorganise a
German brass band, and what effect a shipload of green
apples might have on a Salvation drummer ? Also, would
a jar of sulphuric acid, eaten publicly on the front seat,
break up a bad opera company ?
Isidor Wertheimer, Countess Belle Rilton Clancarty’ f
platonic friend, is at last bankrupt-debts, £lO,OOOl
assets, £99-he would not tell a lie and swear to the even
hundred. He says he was for years depending on a small
salary from his father. Having lost that he has “ lived
on the gifts of his friends.”
Francis Abigail, writing to the press says
that sure imprisonment on conviction will have as
much effect upon professional gamblers as
flogging had upon garotters. Now it has never
been proved that flogging put down garotting.
On the other hand statistics (vide P. A. Taylor’s
speech in the Commons) go to prove exactly the
reverse. It is hard to burst up cherished beliefs
and to convert people who argue from effect to
cause, but there is as little proof that it was
flogging which put down garotting as there is that
the earth is flat. When a garotter is caught and
put in gaol then he ceases to garotte. That was
what put down garotting. Garotting is essentially
a crime committed in secret, and its professor,
like the deliberate murderer, always reckons, not
on being Hogged, but on escaping with his
plunder.

POLITICAL POINTS
The Sydney Reform Club is no longer a
political power in N.S.W. It is said to be in a
moribund condition.
S. A. Railway revenue for year ending
June 30, 1891, was £1,222,000, and working
expenses, £602,000 !
Ex-Speaker Groom asserts that out of 72
members returned at the last Queensland general
, election, 50 were avowed Protectionists.
Nepotism is rampant in the Parliamentary
departments of N.S. Wales, notwithstanding the
existence of an Act to govern the filling of vacant
offices. ,
The Maoriland Parliament has. taken up a
logical attitude on the female suffrage question by
providing that women shall be eligible to sit in
the Legislature.
D. B. Morehead asks how • it is that
M‘llwraith is mean enough to'sit beside the man
who once described him as a thief, and has never
apologised for doing so ?
“ Free labour, Freetrade and freedom of
contract may all be very appropriately run
together; but as for trades-unionism, that is part
and parcel of the policy of Protection.”
The Victorian Eight-hours Day might
well be adopted by the trades throughout Aus-
tralia, so as to make the annual labour celebration
a national instead of a parochial event.
To gratify the loyal and pious aspiration
-of Armytage, M.P. (Vic.), that he may go to the
nethermost hell ere he sees the Australian
Republic arise, would, indeed, be an unjustifiable
waste of Sheol.
Billy Little, member for Woothakata,
X.Q., thinks that hon. members ought to be paid
by results instead of receiving a definite salary.
By the yard ? or by the hour ? or by the pint ?
What are results, anyhow?
Deakin airily suggests that fresh taxation
is required to meet the debit which the late Vic-
torian Government left on the credit side of the
ledger. But he doesn’t want Gillies and Co. to
be taxed too much on the subject.
A weakness in the organisation of the
N.S.W. Trades and Labour Council is that some
of its members are delegates for trades other than
those at which they labour. There is no manciple
violated here, but it is a mistake all the same.
G. R. Dibbs continues to lie very low in
the political arena of N.S.W. He is not often to
be seen in the House after midnight; and his
absence is excused by some on the ground that ho
is drafting a Bill to abolish imprisonment for
debt.
It is obvious that the N.S. W. Labour-
party clearly perceives that the workman hasliltlc
to hope from the publican. livery man with a
decently-balanced brain sees plainly that un-
restrained Bung and the prohibitionist crank are
equally the foes of liberty.
It is stated that the Italians who are to
be indented numerously to Queensland, are tc.
receive the magnificent wages of 11s. per week.
The Bulletin fears that proper foreign-agree-
ments’ legislation can never be passed in Australia
until the Republic comes along.
Glassey's amendment in Queensland Elec-
tion Bill provides for universal suffrage on a six
months’ Queensland residential qualification, and
seeks to exclude aboriginals, Indians, Chinese,
South Sea niggers, and other trash from the
franchise. Amen.
Electoral reform in N.S.W. is heavily
handicapped by Parkes’weak health. His physical
feebleness obliges him to leave the Assembly before
midnight as a rule; and his alleged “great”
measure gets stuck up for hours in the hands of
the garrulous Carruthers, who never knows when
to end a speech.
The German Emperor ukases that no
< ferman babies are to be named after democrats.
Parents are now restricted in their choice of names
to “ the list of national heroes and princes and the
calendar of saints.” In Berlin, for instance, no
one now dares to name his infant son “Hancock
Sauerkraut,” or “Andy Kelly Sausagestein.”
Began, M.P. (N.S.W.), says that he has
known hon. members to squint up at the Press
gallery on rising to address the House, and, seeing
no reporters in the boxes, to sit down again with"
out speaking. Quite right. Broadly speaking,
no speech ever changed a vote. A M.P.’s business
is not to convert the House but to justify himself
before the country.
“ The fundamental article of my political
f creed is that despotism, or unlimited sovereignty,
'or absolute power, is the same in a majority of
a popular assembly, an aristocratical council, an
oligarchical junto, and a single emperor ; equally
arbitrary, cruel, bloody, and in every respect
diabolical.”— Jokn Adams to Thomas Jefferson
November 13, 1815.
Freetraders are constantly administering
the emetic of selecting some exceptional article o*f
commerce as a complete refutation of the argu-
ments of Protectionists. They forget that Pro-
motion is inherently an expedient, and that its
P™p¥ »s the judicious selection of sample lines,
which are hardly likely to. include any of the
favourite illustrations of Freetraders.
The special tram and railway service,
otate-provided for the use of members, is respon-
sible for nearly every late sitting of the N.S.W.
-Parliament. As a matter of fact, N.S.W. thus
expressly subsidises late sittings. In no other of
the Australias are such facilities provided, and in
no other province are late Parliamentary sittings
so common as in N.S.W. The money now wasted
on early-morning Parliamentary trains and trains
would almost bring out Hansard daily,
“ The power of The Bulletin is at last
grudgingly acknowledged in England,” writes a
correspondent by last mail. “Speaking of the
return of so many Labour candidates at the last
\t Section in N.S.W., a member of the
Upper House, at present on a visit here,
told a prominent politician that it was entirely
the work of The Bulletin. He added that you
had done more in ten years to educate the people
in Republican ideas than the whole of the rest
of the colonial press could counteract in twenty.”
Ned Palmer, M.P. for Carpentaria, Q.,
was the other night very sarcastic on Toowoomba
Groom concerning his Protection hobby. The
canny Ned is a man who believes in buying in the
cheapest and selling in the dearest market. He
owns Gulf property, and when we knew him he
used, when on the road, never to stop at a town-
ship. His habit was to camp half-a-mile “out-
side, boil his own billy, and be his own landlord
under the “ blue canopy.” Such a man is “ free-
trade to himself with protection against the
world.”
THe Canadian Government intend hence-
forth to present heads of families arriving from
the U. K. with 15 dollars, the wife, and each
member of the family over 12 years of age,
with 7h dollars, and each member of the family
above 18 years of age, taking up land, with a
further bonus of 7h dollars, in addition to the 1(50-
acre lots now parcelled out to newly-arrived
THE ADVANTAGES OF ADVERTISING.
APPARITION: “I see yer adwertisement in this mornin’s paper for a “companion,” Mum,
and I’ve got a Native here as’ll suit yer right away down to therground!”
families. It is playing it low down on the
Canadian workers to tax them to the extent of at
least 25 dollars for every family arriving in the
much - hood led count ry.
The “ Labour” barometer rose rapidly in
N.S. Wales when the Legislative Assembly, with-
out much ado, passed a Bill repealing the con-
spiracy laws of George IV. The leaders of the
Labour-party developed symptoms of “big bead,”
pointing to that measure as an instalment of the
radical alterations to be made in the statutes.
But the sequel is sad, and shows how little sym-
pathy the Labour-party can hope to receive from
Parkes. No man can be found in the .Council to
.take charge of Mr. Lonsdale’s Bill! Not one man
there to voice the aspirations of democracy ! And
so it will be with other “ planks ” when they are
sent up to that political vault.
A hint to the Anti-Opium Leaguers. Agi-
tate for the prohibition of that sort of specially-
prepared opium that is cooked ready for smoking
and is put up in tins or pots, but admit the gum-
opium, as the ordinary chemist knows it. Herein
is an easy distinction between the medicinal
opium and that designed only for smoking pur-
poses. The illicit sale of opium within Aus-
tralia, to Chinese manipulators who desired to
prepare it for smoking, could be fairly well-con-
trolled by a rigid clause in a Sale of Poisons Act,
and, if the penalties were made heavy enough,
and Customs vigilance were sufficiently alive, the
“ smoking ” opium would become so dear that the
opium habit would dwindle of itself.
Teetotal Macfarlane, M.P. for Ipswich (Q.),
being asked whether he would tax beer, said —“l
would tax all things evil.” Run this sentiment
down the incline and where is Mac. landed ? His
plan would, for revenue-purposes, legalise a lot
of illicit enterprises, and not only legalise them
but make them monopolies. Already, harlotry
is a State institution in Queensland ; but among
“all things evil ’’ are also burglary, garotting,
ravishment, opiatic vices, cant, cattle-duffing, the
“Sup-press,” dummying, usury, fraudulent bank-
ruptcy, bank-clerkism, politics, anti-republicanism,
capitalism, and Godsaverqueenism, &c., &c. The
plan ha,.® its ad vantages. It would enable Trea-
surer MTlwraith to pay off the Queensland debt
in one act and start lending money to foreign
countries. “ All things evil ’ —what a revenue !
The ruins of the Victorian “ Freetrade
Democratic Association ” are now trying to
enliven the dead thing by supplying (good old
Pulsfordiau dodge !) leading articles on Freetrade
gratis to the country papers. But nobody pub-i
lishes them. The country editor simply shoves
them into the W.P.8., and expends his sWeetttVSS
on the bloated melon as of old. The readers may
stand the melon, but they Won’t stall'd Freetrade.
They don’t want to see the old political dead cats
of the Cobden Club glaring at them during break-
fast. The ForeigU-trade doctrine is just old
enough to be horribly dead, and not old enough to
make it worth publishing its skeleton as a
curiosity ; it is like a dirty saint who is suffi-
ciently new to be contagious, and yet too new to
excite reverence by his antiquity; and therefore
nobody can do anything with it. The remains pt
the Victorian Democratic Association should
adjourn for 800 years, and then start afresh.
That Gov. Kin tope has no appreciation pf
Australian aspirations has long been aippareVi't.
His latest idea is to sever Sotith Australia in half
and to have the N.T. proclaimed a Crown colony
—as a stepping-stone to\vanls the realisation of
his Chinophile policy ! Kintore has leanied
nothing from the recent history of Western Aus-
tralia $ nor has the trend of Republican federation
sentiment any lesson whatever for his political
narrowness. It is patent to anyone with eyes and
ears that to create a new Crown colony in Aus-
tralia would be resented by three-fourths of the
whole population of the Australian continent as
retarding that federation and nationalisation that
cannot long be delayed. Any such an Imperial
Act would electrically evoke the Watchword—
“ Hands off, England.” So, in the interests of
speedy Australian development, let the experi-
ment be tried.
In reply to a direct question put in the
N.S.W. Legislative Assembly, the Minister for
Justice said that no. goods manufactured in gaol
were sold to the general public. A Very specious
answer. As Mr. Could is merely the mouthpiece
of the permanent prison authorities, We will take
it for granted that the answer was made by the
Minister in all good faith. But we can give the
Minister the information that his officers have
withheld. It is a notorious fact that the large
city retail houses obtain quantities of goods from
Darlinghurst prison. It is also a fact that all
cricket clubs who need matting get it from the
gaol. Is not. bookbinding for the Schools of Arts
throughout the country done in Darlinghurst and
in the country gaols? One gaoler informed us
that he did a lot of work for the town shopkeepers
but had to deliver it at night so that the public
should not know of it.
Premier Parkes persistently obstructs the
awkward and pertinent defence • enquiries of
Dr. Creed, M.L.C., and says that the doors
of the different divisions of the N.S.W.
Colonial Secretary's department have had to be
actually barred against the inquisitive Doctor.
However, this is no answer to Dr. Creed’s allega-
tions concerning N.S.W. military corruption
dr incapacity, or both. It is no answer to the
charges that one Government contractor has been
over-paid more than £OOOO on his contract; that
three millions of state-paid-for cartridges, costing
£13,000. have been condemned as useless ; that on
a single £2lOO contract for soldiers’ clothing a loss
of over £lOOO lias been made; that guns bought
for £lOO,OOO were unpacked years after arrival
and found to be defective in essential parts ; that
£2OOO worth of material—-the purchase of which
was never authorised—is in store, and that 97 per
cent of it has become useless through mismanage-
ment and old age. Premier Parkes has consis-
tently stood the friend of one of the most
scandalously rotten and mismanaged departments
out of Canada or Turkey.
Tom Mann’s cabled assertion that Labour
cannot yet be adequately represented in the
House of Commons is unfortunately correct. It
shows, moreover, that Thomas is'a better man
than several of his predecessors who have dreamt

Various sigll-s are noticeable, 'especially in UiS
early stages of disease. Afterwards, When the
complaint has blade more progress, the symp-
toms are not so prollolinced owing to the in-
creasing nervOUs prostration and debility ; if
proper treatment is adopted in the first
stages of disease, a restoration of lost vitality
soon takes place—if neglected, rapid decline
takes place, and life is ruthlessly sacrificed.
The greatest danger lies in the prevalence of
many well-known signs—headachcs, nervous-
ness, neuralgia, tired aching limbs, and such
pains are so very common that people attach
but little importance to them, they are con-
sequently frequently neglected, and the patient's
life is sacrificed unless timely aid is rendered.
An early use of Clements Tonic Is essential in
all such cases. This remedy acts directly on
the various organs that govern human life, it
quickens the appetite, aids digestion, stimulates
tlie liver and kidneys, preserves tissue and
forms new bone, muscle, and blood, and entirely
rebuilds shattered constitutions, no matter by
what means debilitated. Mr. W. H. Rowe,
Brisbane (Q), writes under date May 24. —“I
gratefully acknowledge publicly the great re-
storation affected in my general state of health
by the use of Clements Tonic ; for years I have
been in a state of extreme debility owing to
residence in tropical climates, hardship and
exposure, sometimes being confined to bed for
three months at a time, suffering tortures no
pen can describe. I have consulted nine doctors,
and none gave me relief except by stimulants.
Eventually, a friend sent me some Clements
Tonic, and after a continued course of this
remedy my health was much improved. I
continued its use for some months, and now I
enjoy better health than I have known for
years ; I am able to follow my employment,
and never feel ill or sick, and am confident that
had I not used your remedy I should long
ago have occupied a premature grave. You
may use this letter if of service ; for as Clements
Tonic restored my strength, I am naturally
grateful,”

Mr. M. S. Haste, who entered the N.S.W,

request of Mr. John Williams, retires on pension
with his chief.
The salary of the N.S.W. Crown Solicitor
has been raised to £lBOO. The lately-retired John

The Playford Government have introduced

One of the escaped French New Cale-

It is rumoured in London that some of
John i lorsfall’s.old friends contemplate presenting
him with a strong hoop to obviate the danger of
an explosion, in consequence of his connection
with the august and ancient house of Carrington.
In the back parlour of Henry Parkes’ shop
in Hunter-street. Sydney, Edmund Hammond
Hargreaves dictated to David Blair his account of
the first discovery of gold in N.S.W., and next
morning it was published, for the first time, in the
Em pike new- paper.
Jimmy Mirams denies that he made his
first reappearance on the Collins-street “Block”
in the company of the Age proprietor. Some-
body no doubt saw Jimmy being congratulated
by a gentleman, and took it for granted that the
other party was David Syme.
An interview with Mr. James Mirams, in
Melbourne Heliald, reveals firstly that little Jim
is disgusted with Chief-Justice Higinbotham ;
secondly, that he has hopes of being included in
the next Ministry, re-election to Parliament being
taken as read ; and lastly, but not leastly, that
he looks forward to becoming wealthy very soon.
Lady Macdonald’s peerage lias become a
standing joke in Canada, now that each day brings
fresh revelations of the rottenness and corruption
bred by the Government of her late dear, good,

in time to escape being slung out of office on his
Tory ear.
Insolvent Adcock, who elects to stay in
Adelaide gaol rather than give certain information
to his creditors, is now reported to be going mad.
When Adcock was out on bail, sometime back,

it can scarcely be prison discipline that is turning
the gentleman’s brain, anyway. Besides, be-
liever appeared very compos mentis fit the best of

holds a high appointment in the Imperial service.
It was unfortunate for Prince Kruse that he was
not in London during the visit of the German
Emperor; but the date of his marriage was fixed
long before that of the Imperial visit.
Mrs. Proctor, the pretty widow of the
astronomer, after spending several months in
England and Ireland, lecturing occasionally,
sailed from Liverpool for New York, on July
25th. Her mother and relatives live at St Joseph,
Missouri. R. S. Smythe called on her two or
three times in London, and talked of the pleasant
time he had with the genial scientist in Australia,
in which Mrs. Proctor always feels an interest, as
her first'husband was a brewer at Bourke,
N.S.W., where he died.
The late Richmond Thatcher, to whom a
subscription memorial is to be raised, once went
up to engineer Charley Roberts’ candidature for
East Macquarie, and deluged the Plains with
electioneering literature of a brand utterly strange
to the local cockies. Roberts’ opponents were
described as “starvelings,” and their supporters
by every epithet that could be raked up in
Thatcher’s abundant vocabulary. No doubt
Dick’s diatribes lost Roberts the election. Mr.
Peeohey was elected, but he never took his seat,
for he was killed in a main street of Bathurst
through a cur frightening his horses.
The redoubtable Dr. Lang had no admira-
tion for Sir A’fred Stephen, either as a jurist or as
a politician. Wfiat sort of a Roland has Sir Alfred
penned in his autobiography, in reply to this
Oliver from the political parson of the early fifties:
“This gentleman, although evidently designed
by Nature for a comparatively humble position in
the world, has been transformed by Downing-
street influence into an Australian Judge. His
talents are of the humblest order; his devotion to
constituted authority, however absolute, perfectly
abject; and his zeal against everything like popu-
lar freedom and the rights of men, tierce and
rabid.”
G. R. Sims pokes mild fun at the
wretched newspaper fiction that the voice of the
king is the voice of the people, when he remarks :
“ The German Emperor’s visit has had absolutely
no political significance. It may have ‘strength-
ened the bond of union between two great
nations,’ but it hasn’t in the least degree lessened
the indignation with which John Bull beholds the
British Government getting its lead-pencils from
Germany.” Yet, there are thousands of chuckle-
headed old Britishers who honestly believe that
the “ splendid reception ” of a foreign potentate
is full of national significance, just as there are
plenty of puffy, pompous parties in Australia whe
think that the desire for Federation would be
greatly promoted by a fraternal meeting of
Governors, and a grand vice-regal “ drunk.”
When Lord Something Phipps was getting
his colonial experience on Bulloo Downs he
expressed his belief that a droving-trip on the
i-oads would just about finish his education. The
manager, knowing that his lordship would never
get through “on his own nut,” put a withered-up
old cuss, called “Terrible Billy,” in charge, but
gave Phipps the cheque-book. Billy was very
proud of having a real, live lord under his wing,
and never failed to let people know in a don’t-you-
forget-it sort of way. When they arrived at Bal-
ranald, Phipps, according to custom, invited Billy
to liquor up, and Billy, to show what sort of com-
pany he travelled in, drew the barman mys-
teriously aside and whispered—“ That’s Lord
Phipps.” “Yes,” quoth the barman; “and I
suppose you are the Lord Almighty.”
BLUE LIGHTS.
Mate of pilot Schooner: “By heavens, there’s a steamer sunk!”
DECK-HAND: “Yes, I see’d blue lights but I didn’t think much on ’em, so I didn’t rouse
yer.”
The old hands who were lately on Charters
Towers will remember one-armed George Smith,
the leader of the miners in that famous shindy
known as “ The Butchers’ Riot.” Despite his
mutilation, George was a crack miner, and when
the Palmer rush broke out he was one of the first
on the field. After several years of “ hard graft ”
and worse luck, Smith succumbed to the com-
bined effects of poor food and bad grog, and joined
the great majority. His mates buried him about
a mile south of where the present town of Lime-
stone is located, surrounded the grave with a neat
fence, and in a tree inside the enclosure hung the
iron hook that deceased had used as an artificial
arm. For years, notwithstanding the scarcity
and high price of iron, that hook remained in the
tree undisturbed ; even the Chinamen and niggers
having too much respect for the dead to interfere
with it. However, about 18 months since, along
came a white man—in skin —who promptly
established himself as the meanest man in Aus-
tralia by stealing the hook and taking it to his
home, where he now uses it to hang meat on,
Most people have heard of the Texas man who
was so mean that when the church-choir sang
“Old Hundred,” he saved one per cent, by
singing ninety and nine. But he will certainly
have to take a back seat when the Devil’s box-
office opens and the hookist from Limestone
appears.
When murderer Bertrand was apprised
suddenly of the intention to shift him from Mait-
land Gaol to Darlinghurst he shook visibly.
“ What is the reason ?” ho asked, in the tone of
servile deference which is engendered by the
regulations. “ I can’t exactly tell you,” the
Deputy-Governor is reported to have said, “but I
think I am warranted in saying that the change
will be all for your good.” And an hour after-
wards he was in transit under the charge of Chief
Warder Steel. He plaintively implored that his
cat “ Minnie ” should be fed and properly cared
for, and the prison authorities readily undertook
the charge. For Bertrand is the father of Mait-
land, as Old Dorrit was the father of the Marshal-
sea. Twenty-six years ho has been immured
within the high stone-walls of a gaol, and this
was the second opportunity which he had enjoyed
during that period for a phantasmal glimpse of
liberty,, life, and unfettered movement. He was
transferred from Sydney for alleged “ trafficking.”
It is understood that Bertrand will shortly be
released. Every one knows why the wretch.-is
kept in prison—it is not as if capital punishment
had been abolished in favour of astern, unbending
system of imprisonment for life. Bertrand went
in heavily for-the study of Spanish painting and
the organ. During his prison career he joined
Rome first, and then leaped into the bosom of the
Anglican Church. Which goes to show that ; f
you keep a Jew long enough he will become an
orthodox pickle. He used to lead the choir of the
blest at Maitland, as his nasal intonation attested
full well. The unfortunate man is dying slowly
from abscesses, with which his protracted confine-
ment has perhaps had something to do, and it is
only a marvel that he has survived so long. His
release depends mainly upon the result of a
medical examination, and then release will be con-
ditional upon exile.
A friend in need is a man to be avoided.
The trouble about the rival Holy Coats
recalls the difficulty concerning the two skulls of
Cromwell. “ You see, this is his skull when he
was a boy.”
Judge Miller was at Barcaldine, Q., re-
cently, and stayed at Shakespeare’s Hotel. Set-
tling himself down with an interesting book, he
was much disturbed by the vocal hilarity of a
number of convivial revellers in the coffee-room,
including half-a-dozen “commercials.” Judge
Miller despatched an expostulatory messenger to
these merry wights, and the messenger said—
“ Judge Miller says, will you make less noise,
please, as he can’t read.” Instantaneously came
the response from an impudent bagman—“Tell
the Judge he ought to be ashamed of himself, not
to be able to read at his time of life. Why, I
could read before I was 10 years old, and I ain't
no judge.”
A London “ professor ” advertises : “ Red
noses bleached while you wait. Permanent and
sure.” It wouldn’t surprise us if somebody were
shortly called away from Sydney to England on
business.
Somebody writing of the meeting of the
German Emperor with the Lord Mayor of
London, reports that: “The Lady Mayoress
seated herself with delightful ease!” Did she?
And the Emperor stood up in a way that
amounted to genius, and wore his ear in an able
manner, and the presence of mind with which his
hair was joined on to his cranium drew forth
thunders of applause. Also, he ate beautifully.
Law would be a comparatively simple
thing if it were not for lawyers. For example, a
little while ago the Melbourne police attempted a
prosecution for over-crowding, the charge being
that tramcar No. 12 was licensed to carry 20 pas-
sengers, and it was loaded down with Exactly 4p.
The matter looked simple enough ; there was
absolute proof of the identity of the car, and of
the over-crowding; but the company’s lawyer
sailed in gaily and overturned the case in short
order. He demanded to know if this vehicle was
a tramcar “within the meaning of the Act,” and
though everybody knew it was, nobody could
prove it. He wanted to know if it belonged to
the Tramway Company, and though it was quite
obvious that the Tramway Company would have
claimed it if it had found anybody running away
with it, this point raised another difficulty. He
wanted to know if it was licensed, and when a
city official produced the register of the license he
wanted to know further if the license was
good, seeing that it was issued under an
Act passed before tramcars were thought of,
and therefore it wasn’t an Act for the
licensing of tramcars. Everybody Knew the
licence was good, but nobody could prove it—in
fact, nothing ever is or ever will be proved, if it
comes to that—and the case broke down. And
now the present writer is seized with an idea. Ho
intends to kill a man—the Tramway Company’s
lawyer, if possible - and when the case comes on
he will raise the technical point that nobodyfean
demonstrate that he was killed at all, for the pro-
cess of killing is transposing a live thing into a
dead one, and unless some one can give a legal
definition of life, and can tell what death consists
of, nobody can prove that anybody is dead. He
will demand absolute proof that the object on the
Bench is a Judge, and that the place he is in is a
court, and when he gets right down into the un-
fathomable bowels of facts in general he will
defy anybody to prove either circumstance. He
will also want proof that he is the prisoner, and
though everybody may know that he is, they
can't prove it. Nobody can prove anything, in
fact, because he can’t prove himself to begin
with.
The Gospel of Heredity.
Whether or not the assumption that maternal
or pre-parturitive impressions descend to progeny
be true, we can at least affirm that diseases arc
hereditary, and often the only legacies parents can
bequeath to the frail creature yet sojourning in
the land of the unborn. Sociologists and
apologists for crime have endeavoured to show
that the thought, however transitory of the father
to-day, may be the mental food of the child of the
next decade. This would appear to be in unison
with the fact that nature never loses anything,
even the smallest, and actually means that the
perfect animal may forget, but the embryo never.
At any rate this position is too deep and involved
for debate in the limits of the present article, and
we have only just now to deal with the gospel of
heredity as applied to diseases of the body. That
diseases are hereditary is of course a known fact,
and the location of the disease of the parent in the
body of the child is without exception to be found
in the blood, the easiest and most congenial
domicile for its germination. Kidney disease in
its aggravated stages and sometimes in its
initiatory ones, taints the blood to a very
appreciable extent, and this taint is transmissable
through future generations. All men, women,
and children, whose parents have died of kidney
disease should be particularly careful to prevent
this most murderous malady from gaining a hold
on their system. Now Warner’s Safe Cure is the
only known specific for any form of kidney
derangement. And these are simply legion. In
the first place, kidney disorders are terribly
insidious in their attacks. The disease may be far
advanced without any suspicion on the part of the
patient. The sensitised nerves of the organs are
very few and so no danger signal is shown by the
pains usually heralding disease. The presence of
the foe is only known by general symptoms, and
these differ materially in different people. The
effects usually produced are, albumen in the water,
parts of the kidneys called tube casts, the little
tile like drainage tubes of the kidneys destroyed
by congestion and inflammation passed in the
water, an unusual flow of water especially at
night, or an unusually scanty supply, backache,
nausea, dropsical swelling of the ankles, dyspepsia,
flatulency, colic, and headache. The disease
rarely advances much without sympathetically
affecting the liver, and producing irritation of the
bladder. Sometimes the uric acid in the blood
induces a rheumatic state of which neuralgia and
sciatica are the accompaniments. Warner’s safe
cure and pills are infallible in these cases.
Thousands of people in Australasia have attested
the truth of this, and the remedy was discovered
by its curing aggravated kidney disease in Mr.
H. H. Warner.

An enterprising chemist in the small
Thames-side town, Great Marlow, in Bucks, com-
plains sadly of Australian want of appreciation of
a perfume of his invention which he named after
Lord Carington, and of which he shipped a
quantity to Sydney, relying on the reputed popu-
larity of the ex-N.S.W. Governor to get rid of it
at a good profit. He found, however, to his dis-
gust that “ Chawley’s ” popularity did not run to
that extent, and all he has to show is a nicely-
worded certificate from his lordship expressing
approval of the compound. But, as he plaintively
says, “ this won’t pay the rent, will it ? ” He has
been advised to try Burdekin.

“ Look down this list,” said a man to a

Melbourne coffee-palace the other day, “and tell

“Nothing,” replied his friend, “except that it
cmtains an enormous number of Joneses.’ ’
That’s just it. One of the burdens which help to
weigh down the unhappy individual who tries to
runa respectable coffee-palace anywhere in Aus-
tralia is the number of couples who come in with
a carpet-bag full newspapers and bricks, and
register as “Mr. and Mrs. Jones.” They never
have anything but that one carpet-bag, and it is a

Just about half as many folks went a-sail-

its promontories to greet the just-arrived Aus-

ago at a champion boat-race, or a popular publi-
can's funeral. The Government House party
went down in a launch, all the clubs, sailing and
social, were afloat, yachts and rowboats filled the
fair-way, and both Houses of Parliament were
represented on board a couple of particularly
filthy steamers, one of which, a silt-boat, went at
the same time past the Heads to dump out a
cargo of uncleanliness, yet inadvisedly lost an
opportunity of creating vacancies in the Legisla-
ture. No enthusiasm was manifested and a feeble
one-man cheer went up from a crowded steamer
as the war-vessels steamed in. The new-comers
have on board a large assortment of prospective
husbands in blue and brass—especially brass.

interest felt in 44 the arrival of the Australian

Plenty of diseased meat is being sold
around Sydney—cancerous meat, meat carrying
hydatid cysts, likewise tuberculous meat. In other
words, one’s morning chop may plant in him the
ineradicable seeds of phthisis or of that ghastly
hydatid disease which is an Australian speciality.
Eor all the world knows to the contrary the cancer
of cattle is reproducible in humans. Now, if a
grocer sells you half-an-ounce of strychnine in a
pound of sugar he finishes you up promptly and
can be held for murder or manslaughter, but the
butcher who sells you tuberculous kidneys or a
cancerous steak or a flukey leg of mutton, and
who doesn’t polish you off with a spasm or two,
but inflicts on you perhaps years of agony ending
in a horrible death, is not punishable by law.

When the Queen received Kaiser William
at Windsor Castle she wore the epaulettes apper-
taining to her rank as colonel of a German
regiment.
The Sydney Hotel and Caterers’ Employes
Union (a purely male association) has resolved, if
possible, to bring about the abolition of barmaids.
This means, we presume, that the male employe
wants the barmaid’s billet, and doesn’t care what
becomes of that little maiden so long as he gets
it. There is nothing demoralising in being a bar-
maid—at least nothing more demoralising than
in being a toil-worn slavey, or a washerwoman, or
an exhausted hag in a shirt-making establishment
—only the wages are a little better, and therefore
the male apparently wants to get the situation
and throw the female out. The chief argument
against the enfranchisement of woman is that she
was created to look after the comfort and refresh-
ment of man, but the instant she begins to get
more than 10s. a week for doing so some man or
other wants to takethe business into his own hands.
The other argument is that her sphere lies in the
peaceful sanctity of home, but provided there
isn’t too much work to do in the sanctity of home,
the male flunkey is always willing to cut her out.
He even goes into the millinery business when
there is money in it ; and the cookery trade ; and
we have strong suspicions that he goes baby-farm-
ing on the quiet. And he doesn’t feel in the least
ashamed of any of these occupations. The oiled
lie-darling with the scent and the doubtful
jewellery who wants to be a sort of male duckey
in a fashionable bar is about as proud as the
average duke; and the two haughtiest men on
earth are an emperor and the garish gentleman
housemaid in a rich man’s mansion. As for the
barmaid, let her stay where she is if she wants to.
She is an integral portion of the cheerfulness of
the places which serve as homes to many ( men
quite as good as any to be found in the Social
Purity Society ;
Whoe’er hath travelled life’s dull round,
Where’er his changeful tour hath been,
Will sigh to think how oft he found
His warmest welcome at an inn.

A Sydney loan-office advertises that it will
give 10 per cent, per annum for money on deposit.
In the same advertisement it offers to lend money
on mortgage at 5 per cent! Perhaps it means 5

means shixty per shent.

Ex-Governor Carington was amongst the
cream-laid crowd of “respectable ” earls and dukes
invited to meet Albert' Edward on his recent visit
to the mine-owning Lord Fitzwilliam. It was
remarked of these great “nobs” that they were
not people to play baccarat themselves, or allow
it to be played in their houses by any Prince this
side of Heaven. Prom which it would appear
that Baron Bob’s reputation is going up in the
market. Time ivas when he could assist his royal
patron in chucking a nobleman’s furniture, after
a last farewell bachelor banquet, out of the dining-
room window, or dance a hornpipe whilst the
Heir Apparent poured quarts of fizz into ms
(Oarington’s) piano. When the ornaments of the
peerage get particularly “fresh” they always start
filling the piano with Dry. Monopole, or mixing a
claret cup in the coal scuttle. They are terrors
for drinking out of the scuttle.
Of all the regal sights that please
The dreamy, goggle eyes
Of “loyal-toasting” C.M.G.’s
There never shall arise
A vinous vision half so quaint
As this, the poet bets.
. Dear reader, can your fancy paint
The Queen in epaulettes ?
We knew she was the colonel of
A Shaman reg-f-ment,
But, as a soldier, thought the Sov.
Was scarcely worth a cent;
It seems she’s proud to pose as chief
Of troops that fought at Metz—
Her martial spirit finds relief
In wearing epaulettes.
We’ve pictured her with crown of gold
Upon her silvered head, '
Mdit “Womanly ” of ladies old
Who are alive or dead —
Conceived her in the noble act
Of paying Bertie’s debts,
But ne’er conceived, aiid that’s a fact.
The Queen in epaulettes’.
The peace of Europe is her care ;
We always used to think,
When war’s alarms were in the air,
She couldn’t sleep a wink,
But beat her forehead with her hand
Expressing wild regrets ;
’Ti» difficult to understand
The QuCen in epaulettes.
She hares her bosom for the ball :
Dear reader, breathe again
She’ll never like a soldier fall
Upon some open plain ;
Yet O ! it must have been a sight
Eor gods and young cadets —
The marble hall—the jewels bright—
The Queen in epaulettes I

Dear Sirs, —1 have been a great sufferer for oyer
sixteen years from pains in the legs from the hips
down to the toes, and also in great misery for
nine years from a kidney disease, during which
time I found I was losing the use of my legs,
particularly the right one, from weakness in the
joints. I tried nearly every known remedy, and
received but little relief until I commenced to use
the MICROBE KILLER.
It is now eight weeks since 1 commenced its
use, and having used two one-gallon jars, I find
myself an entirely different man. I believe a
little more will entirely cure my complaints, as I
can say that I have not felt so well for eight or
nine years, and can now do my work as well as
ever I could, and also enjoy my meals, which for
many years I could not.—l remain, yours thank-

Apropos of the amalgamation of the legal
profession. A correspondent tells us of a case
typical of what happens frequently under the
existing legal regime. A man engaged a leading
barrister and a junior counsel to conduct his case.
The other side did the same. The two seniors,
having much work on hand, made an unholy com-
pact to stay out of court altogether and leave the
work to the juniors. This was done, but all the
same the seniors drew their fees, including re-
freshers—which were specially asked for although
neither big barrister had shown his face inside
court at any single period of the whole case !
Thus were 60 guineas added to the cost of getting
justice. One of these noble barristers is a member
of the N.S.W. Upper House and will, of course,
vote on patriotic grounds against the Amalgama-
tion Bill.

\. There are quite a number of houses in the
vicinity of Sydney which are empty on account of
ghosts, or else are let at reduced rentals by reason
of the nefarious spectre within. They are'shabby,
red-nosed goblins; q.s a rulqkwil)i ( Hb digiifiA a,bo\it
ihym, but they depreciate the property woefully.
One of these places is located in the eastern
suburbs, and anyone who wants a mansion at an
exceedingly reduced figure might take it with
advantage. A long time ago the tenant fell down-
stairs and broke his miserable neck at 1 a.in., and
for ten years past he is said to have fallen down
these same stairs with unfailing regularity every
night. If anybody happens to be on tlm stairs
the Spectrb falls fight, throUgh him. He isn’t
visible; there iS merely A holldw Void ctashihg

apparition falling into his hall night after night;

DYING MAN (to his loving wife): “James is well up in the business. You had better marry him, my
dear, when I am gone.”
THE GOOD WOMAN: “Don’t worry about that, John. We have already settled it.”— (And married then
were.)
and the adjacent houses go rattier cheap, for
nervous people can hear the bounding of the dead
visitant in the distance, and then they pack up
their goods and shift. Possibly, if the stairs were
removed the spook would quit for want of a
place to fall into, but this doesn’t seem likely;
more probably he would come along as usual, and
prance down a phantom stairway, and crash into
an imaginary hall with just as much racket as if
he were crashing into the real article. Spectres
are very persistent when once they get started.

Anyone who wants to look at one of the
grand old veterans of England can find a sample
hero roosting, almost any day in the week, at the
corner of Collins and Queen-streets, Melbourne.
He is a joyous-looking old soldier, who was bat-
tered and damaged in the famous Indian Mutiny,
and finally crippled and reduced to utter wreck
while fighting for his beloved motherland in the
Zulu campaign at a remuneration of Is. per diem,
with about lOd. knocked off for “deductions.”
Then his grateful country hove him out, and his
gracious Queen turned him up, and the wildly-
applauding nation bounced him. as being no
longer any use. He has a pinched, shrunken,
hungry-looking wife who is still young and was
once rather pretty, but a long course of concertma-
playing at a damp and windy corner has reduced
her to a ragged and forlorn condition. Ihe con-
certina isn’t up to much ; there is a tumour or
something in the meter, and whooping-cough in
the top note( and business Is bad. at that latnp-
bbst whbr'e the Veteran boosts ahd thinks of his

The other day a woman entered a Sydney
chemist’s shop and bought a small bottle of
chlorodyne (the law, curiously enough, provides
that you needn’t sign the poison-book and bring a
witness when you buy chlorodyne, though you
must when you buy laudanum, a not more
dangerous poison). She immediately took out the
cork and swallowed the whole contents of the
bottle. “ Good Lord ! ” yelled the chemist start-
ing to mix an emetic, “why you have poisoned
yourself, woman!” “Oh, no,” laughed she,
“that’s all right, I often drink a bottle ’’—and so
it appears she really does. Druggists will tell
you there are lots of women around wbo consume,
on the average, a bottle of chlorodyne in two
days. Chlorodyne, it may be mentioned, consists
to no small extent of prussic acid and morphia,
and a dose such as that woman took would
ordinarily kill at least four people.

Even the baby-farming industry has un-
remunerative spots in it. In Sydney the com-
petition is getting to be serious, and when an
infant is to be obliterated, there are about eleven
harridans wanting to obliterate that infant. Off-
spring have to be extirpated at a mere shade over
cost price, and the profits of the trade are fading
away. The other day the bailiffs pervaded the
establishment of a lady once in a large way of
business —a person who was tried on a charge of
murder in past times, through undue vigour in
shoving progeny into a better land and found
the stock reduced to three miserable little infants.

which was to be smothered on a cash basis ; and
she fled round to the mother of this unborn en-
cumbrance; and implored her with tears to pay
something m advance. The mother refused to part

time got down to four hours-—then to three—then

The Referee, discussing interments at
Westminster, wants to know why new bodies
can’t be b.uried in the graves where old ones must
have turned to dust long ago.
The Harmy have lilt upon an ingenious
substitute for “The Dead March in Saul.” They
plant their departed “adjutants” and things to
the strains of “ Home, Sweet Home,” which must
sound most comforting to the spirit that has
recently fled to the wrong place.
A strike of engineers employed on the
Thames works of Samuda & Co. has resulted in
the “firm’’giving way, but we don’t notice that
the Sydney Morning Herald or Argus has
preached a sermon on this text.
Hunk of Sydney police-court evidence. A
boy, badly bitten by a dog, was taken to the hos
pi tab It was found that the boy’s parents resided
in a place of two rooms and a washhouse in a lane
in Woolloomooloo. There were about half-a-dozen
in the family, the father being a wharf-labourer
earning some los. per week.
Harry Stockdale’s party of buffalo and
pony hunters, now at Port Essington, is said to
have been formed as much with a view to profit
as to sport, and will encounter considerable
business opposition from numerous other hunters
already on the ground. According to the N.T.
Times (Port Darwin), “ the traffic in ponies and
buffaloes may be found before long to bo a very
imaginary kind of thing.”
In Japan the dead are always buried with
the head towards the north and the feet to the
south. This may be a very fine and large position
to be placed in, but it is infinitely better not to die
at all, and although that is practically impossible,
as we have the tacit affidavits of numerous
deceased that life must come to an end some day,
it may be prolonged to the maximum number of
years by using the prescription of the Bethel
Electric Medical Baths Co., Lonsdale-street,
Melbourne. The Bethel system of curative bath-
ing in electric currents is protected by universal
patents, and the Melbourne institution is one of
the only two in the world.
There is deep, poetic sentiment even inahat
when the finer shades of feeling are evoked by the
artist who compounded it. Messrs. Monntcastle
and Co., of George-street, Sydney, having realised
this fact, have done their utmost to bring out the
hidden pathos which lies concealed in the ordinary
hat, and have met with great success in the effort.
Their featherweight opera hats are a symphony in
felt. Their straw hats in all varieties, including
the newest American shapes, are calm and repose-
ful, and there is an impassioned fervour about their
helmets —made on the premises—and a tranquil,
almost mournful, hang about the puggaree
on the firm’s summer hats which is in itself
a fine artistic effort. The black skin caps
for travelling are calculated to smooth the way of
the pilgrim, and many hundreds of them are now
at the bottom of the sea, the wearers having gone
down in collisions and wrecks, and hung on to
this cap even in death, because they knew they
would never find its equal. The firm also supplies
ladies’ Bond-street shapes for walking and riding,
ladies’ straws in all colours, and are sole agents
for Cooksey’s famous London felts. The latter
article would soothe a martyr in his final moments,
if the martyr knew anything about hats, and in
his last words he would bequeath the hat to his
persecutors, as a symbol of forgiveness and eternal
peace. This statement can be supported by thou-
sands of competent witnesses, if necessary.*

COLGATE’S
SOAPS and PERFUMES
SPORTING NOTIONS.
If there is a single square game in all the froWsy
realm of sport the public has not yet found it out. Pro-
bably they never will. Pretty nearly every adult male !
Australian takes a money-interest in some variety of
sport, and the result seems to be that this nation is one
great unanimous Juggins from one end to the other. The
one and only thing which preserved an outward semblance
of honesty in connection with sport was the totaiisator,
and, judging from the revelations of an ex-totalisator-
oler’k in Sydney D.T., it did this only because it was the
largest fraud of the lot. In fact, as a mechanical iron
liar the private “tote” seems to be the biggest tiling on
earth. In the first place, the greasy rowdy in charge
takes all the big dividends himself. When there is
a very large dividend paid it is through there
being’ only one subscriber on the winner, and
that 0 subscriber is almost always the totaiisator
man. He closes his instrument say 30 minutes before
the race is run, and puts up the list of subscribers 20
minutes before. In the 10 minutes interval he gets the
scratohings by wire from the course, and if there are about
100 subscribers on the scratched horses he knocks off 60
of these, and annexes 60 subscriptions in one act. Also
he "cts the latest tips, and with part of the stolen capital
he backs all the likely outsiders which have few or no
supporters. Consequently ho often scoops half the public
money to begin with, and draws three-fourths of the final
dividend to end with. Every carrier-pigeon which is
despatched from the course, when the scratchings are
announced (the pigeons all most in his back premises
where the human pigeons can’t see them), and pretty
nearly every telegram, represents one more totaiisator
swindle ‘ * • «
There are about 200 totalizators in Sydney and
suburbs, and it is asserted that 196 of these are vile
swindles. The figures look exceedingly probable. They
are supposed to take about £2,000,000 per annum, and
of this the well - oiled proprietors take £200,0C0 in
commission, and about £1,000,000 in underhand frauds,
having £BOO,OOO for the public. Presumably, the police,
or somebody, is tipped by the owners of these frauds, for
the force could rush in and collar about 200 glaring
law-breakers every week, and on an average they only
take one per month. As the average “ cop ” is always
hungering for a good case to help him on the road to
promotion, it is presumed he has good reason for not
hungering after these particular cases. Also, it may be
presumed that his bosses have also good reasons of some
kind or other, else they would sack him forletting 200
criminals get away every Saturday. And as a deoently-
prosperous totaiisator fiend can often make £2OO out of
one ordinary Saturday’s racing, he can afford to give a
helping hand to the honest, struggling constable and
make things pleasant all round. For a great swindle,
supported by the greatest Juggins on record, the betting
instrument and its supporters seem to take the cake.
» * *
“James Burrows,” the author of a £25,000 con-
sultation, was nipped in the bud the other day, being
s 'ruffed by the detectives on the steps of Sydney G.P.O.
just as he was collecting the day’s crop of hard cash. He
was a man with a bogus name and a bogus address, having
blandly used the street number of a decent George-street
jeweller to give an air of respectability to the show, and
he called himself “Secretary to the National Club,”
which was probably correct, seeing that he was the whole
club as well. And the money rolled in gaily on the
strength of these circumstances. He simply invited the
public to send their cash to a man they had never
seen or heard of before—an individual who, for all the
evidence to the contrary, might have been a Chinese leper
or an intoxicated aboriginal; and they sent it. They
always do. If a sweep-promoter rung anybody’s door-
bell, and asked to he allowed to borrow the owner's watch
without security, on his hare, unvarnished promise to
bring it back some day, he would ho kicked, hut when he
puts an equally cheeky advertisement in the papers about
half the population will trust him at once, and when he
swindles them- as he generally does—they will trust the
next man just the same.

Last week there were on show at Ghinnery’s, in
Hunter-street, Sydney, some phenomenal and probably
unique specimens of black bream. One of them weighed
7Jlb., one 6jlh., and there were many others ver 41b.
These “old-men” fish are said to have been netted at
Ulladulla.

Dear Bulletin,—Your correspondent, “ Thos.
W. Webb, Swan Hotel, Richmond, Melbourne,” is in
error. He is evidently confounding Alfred M’Laren with
his brother Bob. The latter came from ’Frisco direct
early in the Fifties and imported his brother Alf. from
England. This I know to be a fact. If “Dick ” Hunt,
the old-time fighting man, be still alive, he can give
interesting particulars of the M'Larens. —Yours, P.

“ Fancy Gloucestershire playing a cricket-match
without W.G. ? ” exclaims an English correspondent,
“ yet, such was the case the other day when that county
met Notts, at Nottingham. The ‘ veteran ’ strained his
back practising, and was unable to take part in the game.
W.G. is being taken out with Lord Sheffield’s team as a
‘ draw,’ but I fear he will be a failure. He is falling fast
into flesh, and even with the enormous amount of exer-
cise he takes, and the temperate life he leads, has quite
lost his elasticity. He has been dead out of form all this
season, and I much fear that his end as a cricketer has
come. At all events he is sure to he a disappointment in
Australia, except to those who want to gape at the
greatest cricketer of all time as they would at some
strange beast. Singular to say, both Lord Hawke and
Hornby are also hors de combat, and are unable to play
for their county. Another of the ‘has beens’ is Billy
Murdoch, who is as fat as a whale and as stiff as a crutch.
He plays a good deal for the M.C.C., hut he never comes
off. Ferris, too, has failed to realise expectations, though
he occasionally does big things on a wicket which suits
him. But, then, almost any man who has any pre-
tensions to being a bowler can get wickets on tricky turf.”
* # *
Common doesn’t read like a very dead bird for
the Doncaster St. Leger, since Surefoot donkey-licked
him, at weight-for-age, in the recent Eclipse Stakes.
However, they seem to be laying slight odds on Common,
upon the assumption that the Derby winner is the best
of a bad lot of three-year-olds. He carries Tummy’s
“ sugar,” too, so The Bulletin has offered up a short
prayer for his success.
* # #
Carbine’s swelled leg is reported to be getting
better. A number of his backers suffered from swollen
heads after last Melbourne Clip—cases of champagne on
the brain, no doubt -hut they got better in lime. There
is consequently no reason why the ’orse shouldn’t pull
round again.

A batch of Chinamen have just been fined in

As a batting performance, the 1411 runs match
at Sydney in 1882, between N.S. W. and Victoria, doesn’t
compare with the Sussex v. Cambridge record of last-
June, when the aggregate scores amounted to 1402
Whereas the Australians took five days to make their
runs, the Britishers knocked up almost the same number
in three days, and only one man, Mr. George Brann,
exceeded the “century’.’ in a single innings.

Blanc, of the Monaco gambling tables, seems
to have succeeded Lagrange and Lefevre as the Franco-
Knglish racing “star,” and will probably carry off the
coming Legcr at Doncaster. They are not remarkable
for high moral principle, these Frenchmen who take to
the English turf. Count Lagrange was several times in
danger cf a mauling by the “scum” through his bare-
faced “roping” of horses in big events. Lefevre (who
originally raced as “Lombard”) was not respected for
his undoubtedly honest racing policy, because everybody
knew that the man had filched his fortune out of a certain
Honduras loan. As for Blanc, decent people can t regard
him as much cleaner than the keeper of a high-toned
bagnio.

From 1885 to 1889 inclusive there were 37
thoroughbred yearlings sold in England f0r95,350 guineas,
giving an average of about £2700 for each yearling.
Twenty-one of these reckless speculations never brought
hack a penny in stakes to the purchasers, and probably
lost them a good deal extra in bets. The remaining 16
won stakes amounting to £28,381. Yet, it by no means
follows that expensive yearlings are not as sound invest-
ments as cheap ones. The chances are just about the
same as in backing horses. A man who bets sovereigns is
apt to lose about twenty times as much during a year as
the impecunious outsider who supports his fancy with
shillings. Only the bigger the money, the more obvious
the moral. And now what price Correze for the Cup?
That’s a regular “ moral.”

Mr. R. J. M'Culloeh, late sporting editor of
the Leader, takes the V.R.C. judgeship, vice Dakin,
promoted to the handicapper’s billet. The interest of the
Leader with racing clubs is somewhat unaccountable.
Bond, a predecessor of M'Cullooh, left the same “ repre-
sentative ” publication to become secretary to the
V.A.T.C. The appointment, of course, is not popular
with the Australasian, which openly gnashes its teeth.
The new judge is a most competent man and a good all-
round sport.
* * *
The Dillon case calls attention to the lament-
able want of a sound policy for guiding the decisions of
leading racing clubs in Victoria. The horse, Dillon, his
owner and jockey, were disqualified for two years by the
Caulfield stewards. An inevitable appeal to the mighty
Y.R.C. resulted, in the first instance, in the case being
sent hack for reconsideration. And when the Caulfield
had endorsed the original verdict the V.R.C. coolly
accepted the explanation of owner and jockey (for the
quadruped couldn’t throw any light on the trouble) and
revoked the opposition club’s sentence. Wherefore the
public are left to assume that either the V.R.C. com-
mittee, or the V.A.T.C. stewards, are ready to swear that
black is white, or vice versa.

An American authority gives to Slavin ‘‘ the
crown of the foremost fighter in the world. There is no
mistake as to the crushing power of this towering, glower-
ing, beetle-browed pirate. He is wicked in every aspect of
him—his height, his reach, his look, and his handling of
himself. Here, indeed, is a lion for the combat, and bones
crunch in his path.” This is the apotheosis of the big,
glorified prize-fighter. He is a individual with a halo of
crunched bones and banged stomachs, and a wreath of
damaged smellers is twined about his noble brow.

A more pitiable exhibition, writes our cor-
respondent, than that made by Smith in his recent
fight (?) with Ted Pritchard never was seen. How on
earth such ari impostor ever achieved the reputation of
being a fighting man, I cannot imagine. In his battle
with Jackson he showed the white feather, but it would
be hard to say what was the colour of the plume he ex-
hibited when tackled by Pritchard. In the first round he
made a mad rush, and by sheer force of weight floored his
plucky opponent, who had much difficulty to come up to
time. Once up, however, Pritchard soon found out a
soft spot in Smith, and knocked him all over the place,
until at last the cock-tail champion covered his face with
his hands, after the manner of a cowardly schoolboy,
then turned his hack and never once attempted to strike
a blow. In this position he allowed himself to he floored,
and there he remained until the stipulated time
had elapsed, and the verdict was given to
Pritchard, who is now dubbed “ Champion of England !!”
Pritchard is a plucky fellow and a good boxer, and it will
take a good man of his own weight to put him out. But
he is a tool if he thinks that he can ever hope to cope with
Slavin and men of that calibre, each fit and well. Slavin
for the moment is keeping very quiet, but I suppose we
shall soon hear of him again, now that we have a new
champion of England. His friend, Mr. Charles Mitchell,
has been showing some of his rowdiness again, and
has been hauled before the beaks for beating a poor,
inoffensive Swiss waiter. It must cost “ Pony ” Moore a
small fortune to square all these little matters for his pre-
cious son-in-law.
Ifc will be noticed by our advertising
announcements that the office of the Freehold
Investment and Deposit Bank has been removed
to commodious and handsomely fitted up premises
situate 335 a George-street, Sydney (two doors from
Wynyard-street). The lines upon which the
operations of this institution are carried on should
be a guarantee to the investing public of “sound-
ness. The result of economical management in
this case, combined with absence of a share-list, is
the division of the profits among depositors as
interest.*

gorgeous champion belt presented to him. His presence
in London is urgently' requested by' the big pug-bosses,

THE STRONGEST ARGUMENT.
A recent issue of tne Wolverhampton
Chronicle contains the following : “ We have for
a long time heard various reports of the wonder-
ful effects produced by the use of St. Jacobs Oil
in chronic cases which had been given up as in-
curable, but had always supposed these were
enlarged upon for advertising purposes, like all
other patent or proprietory medicines, but the
reports from all our leading chemists must be
considered one of the strongest arguments which
can be advanced respecting the value of any
leading article of trade in their line. The
uniformity of these reports will be noted at once.
All speak in the highest terms of the value of St.
Jacobs Oil as an outward application for pain.
The oil is only advertised to cure rheumatism,
neuralgia, gout, sciatica, and those bodily pains
where an outward application is used. The pro-
prietors of this popular remedy never advertise
the oil to cure those diseases which it will not
actually cure. By so doing they have gained the
confidence of the people. Wo sec by the Liverpool
papers that St. Jacobs Oil is used largely on
board of nearly every steamship that sails from
that port. Many companies, including the
Ounard, White Star, and some of the South
American lines, do not even consider their ships
ready for sea unless a sufficient supply of this
popular remedy is on board to last the voyage.
Latterly we are informed that all H.M. troopships
leaving Portsmouth take a large supply of the od
on board. The oil is in yellow wrappers for
veterinary purposes, is being used with equally
good results by the leading omnibus and cab
companies of London and provincial cities for use
on horses for sprains, sore shoulders, and general
ailments where an embrocation is required.”
“ A leading article in a recent issue of the
Chemist and Druggist stated that St. Jacobs Oil
had the largest sale of any medicine in the world ;
and when an article possesses the actual merit
which St. Jacobs Oil undoubtedly does possess,
the proprietors are entitled to receive the benefit
of the enormous sale which this popular remedy
has.”
NOT A LUXURY,
BUT A NECESSITY.
THAT IS LUXENE.
Although it is luxurious in the sense that it
affords the most pure, brilliant, and safe light
that it is possible to obtain for the home, the
factory, and the workshop, for public halls,
churches, concert rooms, schools of art, and all
and sundry buildings whatsoever and wheresoever -
situated.
LUXENE, the new illuminant, is one of the
stepping stones that mark the rapid strides of
progress in an age that must and e ill have its
novelties, but wants them good, and not too high
priced.
LUXENE is a source of assured comfort ta all
house holders, male and female, and more particu-
larly to the anxious, nervous members of that
great family, by reason of its incomparable purity
and safety.
LUXENE is also a pleasure to use, inasmuch
as it is not requisite to own tools, or to borrow
the contents of your neighbor’s tool-chest, before
you can get it out of the tin, which is fitted with
a patent faucet that a child can work.
LUXENE is moreover the most economical
light in present use. It gives better results and
costs less money, proportionately, than any other
kind of oil used for the purpose.
LUXENE has made a host of friends for itself
in the short time that has elapsed since its first
introduction to this country. And the more it
makes the more it continues to make.
LUXENE is an accomplished fact, and it’s no
use trying to wrestle with it. Ask Messrs. John
Barlow and Co. ; T. W. Eady and Son ; D

Pour out that wine—’tis Lethe’s cup—
And let the wild war-song go up;
To-night we’ll drink to godlike men
Whose words shall chain the ages—then,
To-night we’ll drink that other sphere,
Whose domed temples dim appear
Beyond the mists, beyond the shades.
Beyond the shot-rent barricades.
Hark ! how the world-storm shrieks without;
Hear! fierce and long the myriad shout
In hall, and square, in mart, and street —
Where worms rob, lie, drink, brawl, and eat ;
Prey on themselves ! The murd’rer so.wls,
The wanton leers, the bald rake prowls.
See ? Innocence to death is trod,
And Love is—Lust, and Mammon—God.
Shut out that street, its yellow glai’e,
Its mud, its woe, its grim despair.
Close well the door ! let sight and sound
In wild uncurbed joys be drowned.
This wine is red—more red than blood—
Their blood. The rich grape’s purple flood
Is ours. The fruits of earth, the flowers,
The corn, the oil are ours—all ours.
And theirs ? But what of them—above ?
The All-Good watches, and his love
(So the priests say) is strong and great —
Then, if they hunger—let them wait.
On with the feast! My latest girl
Is opal-eyed ; her teeth are pearl;
She’s Love’s own child, and her red lips
Are red as the red wine she sips.
On with the feast! We are alone.
This drink is strong —the guests have flown.
’Tis late ! How now ? My love, no doubt,
Is drunk. What’s this ! The lights are out.
Ah ! found at last! Awake! Awake!
Have I not lost all for thy sake ?
And have I not My God !! her breath’s

Sydney, August 3, 1891.
Says Sydney Echo : —
Under present sociological conditions, capital crimes
are a matter of averages. All the punishments of the in-
human past did not check them; all the penal codes of
the present do not disarrange the average number of such
atrocious offences.
Starting from this premise, the Echo does not
conclude, as might be expected, that capital
punishments are therefore unwarranted, because
inoperative, but simply demands mildly that “ no
torture shall bo added to the last vengeance of
mankind.” Had the Echo the desire or the
capacity to be logical, it would have argued that
capital punishment, being avowedly no deterrent,
is not the less undesirable, because the sole
remaining excuse for retention is as a means of
social vengeance. The community should be, and
is, more moral, more self-restrained than any one
of its components; but when it sets a bad example
to individuals by slaying in the name of all, it
simply perpetuates the crime that it would prevent.
Two ladies of the sort who go round col-
lecting for bazaars and church - swindles, and
getting donations for the sin-remover, struck a
dreadfully hard snag in Sydney the other day.
They had been “ laying for ” a man in the fancy-
goods line, and had haunted his shop off and on
for six weeks to get a workbox or a desk or a
bronze horse out of him for the great cause. Some-
times he was out, sometimes he dived below the
counter just in time, or fled upstairs when he saw
them coining; but at last they took him unawares
and button-holed him. One of them vvas a large,
hard-featured female with a bag ; the, other was a
small, roley-poley lady with another bag, and
they each wore a great, heavenly smile and large
boots. Roley-poley spoke first. “Ian so glad to
see you, Mr. Smith. We just called in to ask
if you wouldn't like to give something to our
church bazaar, and ” “I’m very sorry,
indeed,” said the importer, blandly; “if you
had called when I was in I might have been
able to do something for you. Unfortunately,
I’m out to-day.” “You’re ic/wf?” “ I’m cut—
from home —unavoidably detained, you know—
had to go into the country.” The little, fat
woman looked at him in perplexity, and the large
fat woman glared, “ I beg ycur pardon, I’m sure,
but where did you say you were ?” “ Out! Had
to remain at home owing to a dreadful attack of
toothache. I’m awfully sorry. I’ll be back again
sometime next year.” “ But—really— I don’t
quite understand. It was Mr. Smith we wanted
to see.’’ “Quite so, madam.” “Well, you are
Mr. Smith, are you not?” “Certainly, and I
would be most happy to see you if 1 were in, but
then unfortunately I’m not. Just went out a
minute ago, to have a bath, in point of fact.”
“Oh, I see!” murmured the small, fat woman
vaguely, falling back against the counter. “I
quite understand. You’re o-o-cut, of course.”
Then the large woman grasped her bag and
advanced fiercely. “Mr. Smith,” she said sternly,
“ will you please stop this fooling and give us an
answer ?” The importer never turned a hair. “ I
assure you, madam,” he responded blandly, “I’m
not fooling. I’ve only gone over to Melbourne.
Went over by the express yesterday.” There was
such a heavenly calm about him when he said it
that the two fat women turned and fled. And as
they went a wild howl of insane mirth arose
behind them, and when she heard it the big, fat
woman swore out loud in the street, and the small
round female burst into tears.

The proprietor of the London Pelican Club
has been fined for selling liquor to a non-member,
an excise officer, who«fcalmly walked into the club'
and called for his drink. Mr. Cooke, the magis-
trate who heard the case, ought to be wittily
described as the. Pelican’s beak. The Bulletin
generously places this joke at the disposal of the
London press.
An unqualified man, named Steedraan,
has practised for eight years in Dublin as Dr.
Macredy, the real Maeredy, who is an invalid,
never knowing-/ that his personality had been
fomped after his ‘retirement from business. Sus-
picion was first attracted to Steedman by the
ridiculous rapidity with which he cured his
patients. The wretched impostor was so shock-
ingly unqualified, that he couldn’t keep ’em from
getting well in the ordinary course of nature, and
all the regular practitioners of Dublin are exulting
over the accident which brought about the ex-
posure of such an insult to a learned profession.
The Argus is developing a turn for serious
humour, and the Saturday edition now includes a
couple of columns of copy that might strike a full-
grown elephant as being peculiarly light. The
funny man of the staff has- evidently received
orders to sparkle all he knows, and the result is a
gleaming compound of paragraph and verse which
doesn’t seem too much out of keeping with the
rest of the paper- It isn’t robust humour exactly,
or delicate huniohr, or well-defined wit that opens
and shuts up with a snap. But it is good, sound
Argus persiflage which Ought to commend itself
to the Pastoralists’ Union and be the cause of
many a hearty laugh in deeply religious circle's.

There’s no deception about the stage
champagne they drink in “ Cinder Ellen.” It
isn’t what Fred. Leslie calls “ Property jiere et fils

—a new dry Imperial indigenous to the soil. In
point of fact, it is Weigel and Co.’s champagne, the
rare gaseous tipple which got such a gushing free
advt. from Hopetoun at the Agricultural Show.

A correspondent writes
Dear Bulletin - ,— So a Mr. Dick denies that a Melbourne
mannas the inventor of the “Wolseley” sheep-shearing
machine. I assure you that Mr. John Howard is the
inventor of the machine now working under the name of
the “Wolseley,” and that Howard is still employed by
the company at the rate of £lO a week and per centage.
The machine was first made in Edward street, E. Bruns-
wick, Melb. (in Mr. barter’s workshop). Mr. Wolseley
did make a machine, but it was Howard who made it
work. His first exhibition of its capacity was when lie
shore rabbits with it at East Brunswick.—J. E. K,
Prirna-facie, the fact seems to be that Mr. Wol-
seley conceived the idea and that Mr. Howard
worked it out and improved upon it. The ques-
tion could presumably be settled by a word from
Mr. Wolseley.
We have received a, prospectus of an
association known as the “Institute of Bankers of
N.S.W.” which has just started—or is just about
to start—in Sydney. The new movement lias 31
rules; the first one refines it as an Association of
“gentlemen.connected with various branches of
banking,” anil S'JO Sydney and suburban bank
officials have' already joined without a single one,
it would seem, being rejected on the ground that
he isn’t a gentleman. The'lnstitute proposes to
consider and discuss “ Matters of interest to the
profession”—2s per shent interest, most probably
which opens up a large field of inquiry. The
matters The Bulletin would like to see discussed
are sornewhat numerous, and it trusts the bankers
will find time to look info the following questions ;
(1) Why is it that nobody can find the reserve fund
after the bank busts ? (2) When a bank offers 10 or
12 per cent for deposits fixed for a term of years,
is the whole institution going to skip before the
term is up, or is it going to.pay up the interest out
of the next lot of deposits? (3) What becomes of the
moral bank clerk when he comes out of gaol? (4)
Is it, advisable to appoint an advanced con-
-8 m Pt Was mam-ger, so that after his death the
slu rtag!,"can be put down as the result of his
defalcations, or is it best to select a man with
chronically afflicted with the fantods ? (5) Ought
(ill the directors’ uncles to have a large, unsecured
overdraft apiece? (0) Is it the better policy to
declare a 1(J per cent, dividend the week
before the smash, when there are no assets left
but a hatful! of bad bills, or to reduce the dividend
to 10 per cent, and carry a large sum to the
reserve as an evidence of the stability of the
institution ? and (7), when the manager and the
secretary find there is only £IOOO left in the whole
shop, and the said £IOOO is a dep sit by a widow,
and they toss up to see which will take £750 and
be the base individual who slid with the whole
concern, and which will take £250 and stay
behindhand be the weeping down-trodden victim
then where does the widow come in ? Various
other questions are hold Over.
All these are lawful ; but to hold aloof
-And spy upoh the guest beneath thy roof,
Again to set the table, and to watch
Until suspicion ripens into proof—
Far, .far from thee he such unworthy arts,
Whether thou mix with bounders or with harts,
Let not a public scandalised behold
Hosts ahd detedtives thus exchanging parts.
Safe shall thy secret be when shared with ten,
My son, and only seven among them men ?
Ay, if thou pack me up yon brood of chicks
dnoe -more in eggs heneath the sitting hen !

Spread the Truth.
Brave tne anger of the wealthy ! Scorn their
bitter lying spite !
Pen the truth in simple language, when you know
that you are right!
And they’ll road it by the slush-lamps in the
station huts at night.
I have seen the People’s triumph in the visions o
my dreams;
It is pictured by the camp-fires down the lonely
western streams,
And the teamsters talk about it as they tramp
beside their teams.
Write the Truth in simple language, and you sluu
not write in vain !
Sing a ringing song of freedom, and you’ll hear the
same refrain
Where the drovers ride together far across the
western plain.
Write of wrongs that you are hating with the
grand old burning hate !
For the lonely digger reads it when the western
day is late,
And he marks it in the paper he is sending to his
mate.
Write the Truth in simple language when you feel
it in your breast !
It will roach the far selections in the wide Aus-
tralian west,
Where the bushmen yarn together on a sunny day
of rest.
Oh! the workers’ new religion spreads beneath
the southern skies,
And the bearded fathers read it, for its words are
kind and wise,
And the little children listen to the Truth with
wondering eyes.

There are rumours in Sydney of a new
morning paper—apart from the one contemplated
by the N.S.W. Trades and Labour Council—and
it is said, on good authority, that the necessary
machinery has been ordered. Now, a newspaper-
plant almost invariably means a newspaper.
Granted the existence in idleness of some old
rickety machine associated with a dozen failures,
and a lot of “pyed” half-worn type, you will
always find someone or some set of people ready
to spend thousands around that ruin. “ How oft
the sight of means,” &c.
The successful achievement of Ross, the
latest murderer—the Gippsland throat-slitter of
Freitag—is another and bloody illustration that
the gallows is no deterrent from crime. With
the universally-advertised Colston’s “ dull thud ”
yet reverberating in his ears, with a processional
panorama of judicially-strangled victims dangling
from gallows-trees yet before his eyes, Ross
calmly sharpened up his knife and proceeded to
slice off Freitag’s head. Not all the recent “ dull
thuds,” not all the “affecting orations ” from the
Judges, not all the black-cap terrors and “God
have mercy on your souls,” had the slightest effect
on Ross, who, remarking—“l was born to do
it ” —did it.
Mr. Justice Foster (N S.W.) has been
ordered to Europe by the doctors.
Who is the new N.S.W. Crown Solicitor 1
Why “Mr. Smith, from England.”
With the fall of the Bank of “ Van
- Diemen’s Land,” the old name of Tasmania finally
dies.
It is cabled that Mr. Hall Smith, secretary
of the Royal Bank of Queensland at London, has,
within the past month, lost his wife and four
children from diphtheria—the result of sevver-gas.
Nobodies never die. The advertisement
of an Anglo-Australian Bank states that a London
Director is Mr. Vesey Fitzgerald, the J.V.F.L.
Foster of nigh 40 years ago, when he was sent to
Melbourne as Sir Chas Hotham’s Chief Secretary,
to help foment the Eureka Stockade trouble.
Miss Gurney, who has had the luck to
capture Lord Dudley, is “well-born,” but her
parents met with reverses of fortune, and her
mother started in business as a fashionable dress-
maker, having been the first to embark in that
now common but precarious occupation. She
failed.
How on earth can a Judge be expected to
do justice in court when his very household goods
are being sold off by creditors; and attorneys
who appear before him to argue cases have
judgments against him in their pockets? The
scandal is in everyone’s mouth and is becoming
insupportable.
“ A straw shows,” &c. In a letter to
S.M. Herald, Dr. Creed is made to say: “I
never have, nor do I desire to attack Sir Henry
Parkes in his private character, but his political
career is public property. As his opinion of my
strength has varied from time to time, I havehad ex-
perience of both of these phases of his character,”
We read the letter over and over again in order to
discover what were the phases of character
referred to. The mystery was, however, solved
on taking up the other Sydney morning paper.
In the D.T., whose editor had not “ toned down ”
the Doctor’s letter, following “ public property,”
were these words: “and of it I say, without
hesitation, that he has always been a toady to the
strong, and a tyrant to the weak.”
The Australian Mercantile, Loan, and
Guarantee Company, which came to hopeless grief
the other day in Sydney, seems to have been a
good little “bank ”in its way—as banks go. It
was a bottomless grave for deposits—a burial-
place for the shareholders’money—a region where
unlimited legal tender was swallowed and put out
of sight. Its chief asset seems to have been
£50,000 paid, or said to be paid, for the goodwill
of a business which consisted chiefly of an office and
an uncertificated bankrupt, A large number of its
shares were sold to itself; its original manager
was a kind of self-appointed individual who
existed principally to own a salary and a
big overdraft. The securities can’t be found, the
shareholders are either non-existent or have bolted,
or are dead broke; the two most enterprising
directors have skipped with a large amount of the
cash ; the scrip on which advances have been made
is partly absent and partly waste-paper; the
books and the balance-sheet are chaos; and the
shortage, so far, is £129,000. Consequently the
few genuine shareholders bid fair to be cleaned
out to the last cent to pay the costs of liquidation,
.and the prospects for the depositors are as nearly
nil as anything earthly can be. And of such is
the kintrdora of Heaven.

Cloete, sometime Water-Police Magistrate at

According to the latest Theosophist, there
is only one cause of death —wearing out of the
will-power. If the patient sits up resolutely
even in his last extremity, and swears with
sufficient mental vigour that he won’t die, he will
remain alive indefinitely. He must simply
resolve that Death will have to climb over his
dead body to get at him, and the thing is done.
The individual who faces the Destroyer with iron
resolution can live for ever.
“Take the ordinary day-labourer, who>
by industry and frugality, manages to get his son
educated into a superior class, and get his
daughter married into a class above her.” This is
a gag by a “National” Association orator in a
Melbourne suburb last week, followed by “ laugh-
ter.” That seraphic day-labourer, unless than a
policeman’s wages, gets his daughter married to
the dashing Mr. M. Bezzler.
Despite the N.S.W. Supreme Court
decision to the contrary, the Wilcannia (N.S.W.)
P.M. holds that the Salvation Army has no right
to hold meetings in the public streets. They know
law much better in Wilcannia than they do in
Sydney. It was a Wilcannia magistrate, for
instance, who lately sentenced a man to gaol and
a lashing for applying to him an opprobrious
epithet. When the convicted man reached
Darlinghurst prison it was found that there was
no law for the penalty imposed and the man had
to be sent back—at the expense of the State !
The N.S.W. Art Society’s Exhibition was
officially opened on Saturday last, with consider-
able eclat. On the evening of the same day,
the members and many distinguished visitors
foregathered in solemn conclave round the groan-
ing board and exchanged soft sawder over stuffed
turkey, and made many compliments to the dulcet
chink of glasses. Late in the course of events
it was after ten o’clock—speeches were delivered ;
Mr. J. R. Ashton, His Excellency Lord Jersey,
the Jaynil Dan, and others variously distin-
guished themselves. The artistic show, apart
from the gubernatorial and gastronomic aspects
of the opening ceremony, is distinctly good.
Without having, perhaps, any one picture of
extraordinary merit, the general display is of a high
character, and the exhibition, taken as a whole, is
of more consistent quality than that of any pre-
ceding year. The most striking picture in the
room is, in the opinion of the writer, Albert J.
Hanson’s “ In the golden gleam of a summer
sun.” Other prominent paintings are J. Mather’s
“Harbour Lights,’’ Lister Lister’s “Flowing
Tide,” G. P. Nerli’s portrait of Dr. Marano, a
clever landscape by W. H. Howes, which he calls
“Frogs’ Marsh,” and Sydney Harbour by moon-
light, by A. H. Fullwood. The strong side
of the show is, however, distinctly water-
colour, in which section the work of J. Mather,
J. R. Ashton and B. E. Minns stands prominently
forth. The trustees of the National Art Gallery
have purchased several specimens of alleged Aus-
tralian art, comprising, amongst some pictures
really and genuinely typical of our country, a
diagram of a lobster {not a “pot-boder”) and a
panel of roses.
The two belles of the Melbourne hunt are
sisters—daughters of a millionaire squatter. They
insist on growing their own horses and attending
to them altogether. Yet one relishes more the
style of Hopetoun’s Estella and Dorothea, milking
the Macedon cows and making hay.
Dear Bulletin, —Let mo tell you about
my visit to the now-departed Sara Bernhardt. I
was going to the post when I met a lady friend
who asked me to come with her to the Australia
to see Madame. Regardless of my frayed gloves
and somewhat neglige attire, I accepted the invite
with avidity. My (and Madame’s) friend rushed
into the Bernhardt’s room without knocking, and
were received with effusion. I was surprised to
see the utterly natural and unassuming woman
who welcomed me, and stared very rudely at every
detail of her face and dress. Shew rea“softgown
in graceful deshabille ; the folds fell in harmonious
lines emphasising the graceful outlines of her
form ” {d la Sydney Telegraph !) her hair, which
really is very rufous, was knotted loosely back,
leaving a big, frizzy halo round her face —which
was almost plain till she smiled, and then a great
and magical change turned its plainness into
beauty. Her voice was not so sweet as cn the
stage, but her manner is most fascinating. Just
like a snake ! She indeed recalls an elegant ser-
pent, with her sinuous, slow, stealthy movements,
and her brilliant, black eyes. A big Newfound-
land dog, named “Auckland” (he hails from
Maoriland), sat awkwardly and solemnly by,
and Sara tried to make him sit up, but the poor,
unwieldy fellow kept rolling over, and at last,
with the cry of “Stupide!” and that fearful yell
of disgust she so often gives when acting (as
though all the gall in her body had poisoned her
soul), she left him, quite crestfallen, with his big,
honest heart only too willing to please, but, as
she says, “We do not understand each other
yet, he does not know my language, and I do not
know his.” As we went into the bedroom,
the little, ugly pug-dog sat deliberately on
Madame’s train, and she dragged him across
the room, saying, “Ah ! this is his favourite
vay of amusing himself.” It was very
funny, but made a pretty picture, Madame
walking in her usual picturesque way, looking
over her shoulder at the ugly pug, chatter-
ing affectionately to him in French diminutives,
and wearing (grotesque to relate) that inex-
pressibly “fetching” air which we all know so
well in the “ love-scenes,” specially “ La Tosoa,”
under the big hat!! The first thing I noticed in
her room was its untidiness. (Perhaps it would be
more polite touseaFrench equivalent for the word).
The chairs were awry, and no wonder, when the
dogs played havoc with them. And the bed was a
rumpled wilderness; seeing my eyes rest there,
Madame, of the Titian rose locks, said ; “Ah,
that is my pug, he loves a frolic on the bed, and
sleeps there.” I must confess I did not like this
trait of Madame’s. We saw the star’s robes
and her big, brown, feathery travelling-hat—from
whence have come the remarks : “Have you seen
La Bernhardt ?” “No, but I have seen her hat.”
The dresses were lovely but needed the charm of
the wearer to be “ quite too utterly bewitching,”
as the Sydney newspaper man says. . . . And
strangest of all that I care so little for this honour
which some folks might have grown a couple of
inches after having reefived. T his is a true and
unvarnished, unreported tite-u-tHtc visit.—M.H.

No. XIV.—John Price’s Bar of Steel.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The sea-breeze fanned the symmetrical
stems of the giant Araucaria transplanted by
Colonel Foveaux to the front of Government
Cottage, and swept from its fronds a chord or two
of the music which the undisturbed centuries had
there garnered. The nearer face of Mount Pitt,
alpine in its solitude, was flushed with the pallor
of a South Sea moon ; the blue of the ocean lay
intersected witli broad, fan-like beams of pearly
radiance. It was such a night as poets dream of
and delight in, and, in other climes, as the nightin-
gale sings to the listening rose ; such a night as,
in this newest clime, John Price enjoyed to the
utmost.
* * *
A born captain of men, and knowing the
seamy side of human nature, as (to the evil
Deities’sorrow) few men who have visited these
colonies have done, he was so constituted as to in-
tensely enjoy every form of physical beauty. In
the midst of any scenic splendour, or in the
presence of finely-proportioned man, convicted or
not, or beautiful woman, he would forget even to
fix his eyeglass; and the hard grey of his eyes
would lose that dreadful faculty of penetration in
which consisted the main source of his power over
the convict creature and the newer penal official.
And when John Price’s face lost the use of the
stony stare of the crystal disc, and the metallic
keenness of the unveiled eye, then John Price was
not himself.
There were frequent moments when he was not
himself. Take any of the sparse convict survivors
of the Old Regime, or any of the scarcely more
numerous representatives of the subordinate Penal
Officialdom, and they would deny this. They
would assert that John Price was never aught but
himself —that is to say, the sternest of discipli-
narians, the most sceptical of moralists, the most
saturnine of humourists, and the most exquisite of
torturers. That drawing of him is about as true
in perspective as that other picture limned by the
partial hand of superior officers and of personal
friends, in which the figure of the Commandant
stands clothed with a majesty of character little
short, considering his temptations, of saintliness.
John Price was neither a saint, nor yet of that
high degree among demons which would entitle
him to a shout of “Hail, brother!” from the
sovereign and princes of the damned on his
entrance into the Nether World. He was, truly,
a many-sided man, the majority of whose facets
were, unfortunately for himself, shaped by the
planing-steelofthe System. The System put under
its knife the material which, under other conditions,
wielded as a sword against its natural enemies,
would have formed a general of inspired audacity,
a leader of dauntless courage, and an adminis-
trator of unerring prescience. But—the Fates
were just! If there was scarcely a convict whom
the System and the Regime did not spoil more or
less, neither did they spare the officials. And as
John Price from his varied service in three
colonies was the instrument of contamination to
more destinies than was any other administrator,
it was only to be expected that the loss he person-
ally suffered should have exceeded that of all other
servants of the System. The life which might have
ended at the doors of Westminster Abbey was
miserably let out by felon’s hand on Williams-
town Pier. He whom the System created, died
by the System. Which was justice according to
the System.
* * *
On this night, when Despair, throned im-
perially in her realm of Norfolk Island, decked
herself with the effulgence of Heaven in mockery of
the twelve hundred kindred mortals who sweated
terror-drops beneath their stamped blankets, or in
the embrace of fetters which they nursed tenderly
so that the iron should not enter too deeply at
night into the wounds it had punctured during
the day; on this night, John Price, Civil Com-
mandant, passed with a guest, from his dining-
room to the verandah, and gazed on the glory.
He thrust the less-known facets of his character
into the view of his guest.
“ A heavenly evening,” he said; “I never saw
a finer.”
“ Nor I!” was the answer.
They exchanged no other word. Each steeped
himself in the rapture of the moment, and forgot
his companion. Price gazed in the direction of
Phillip Island, his visitor to the zenith.
Then a child’s voice broke the silence. A tiny,
white-gowned figure glided out the hall doorway,
and called its father.
“Fa’ver ! Where is you, fa'ver?”
“Here, sonnie. But.' fie ! Not in bed yet?”
The youngster trots on his naked feet half the
length of the verandah, and, at his father’s side,
holds out his hands so that he might be lifted up.
“I t’udn’t do to bed, fa’ver, not wi’out saying
my new prayer.”
“A new prayer!” The stern Commandant
stoops and gathers the little one within his arms.
The guest thinks if he were the father he would
have echoed the words ashamedly, for there is
something discrepant between the position of an
absolute ruler of twelve hundred slaves and the
function of a father listening to the lisping of an
infant’s benison. Not so, thinks John Price.
With all his faults, he did not fear God, man,
nor devil, and it is only the coward who insincerely
gives heed to another’s opinions. The whole
world might have stood by, and John Price would
have done just the same.
“ Ees, a new prayer, fa’ver ! Danny teachod it
me, an’ I isn’t to tell on’y you, fa’ver.”
“ AH right, little man, go on.”
The child slipped from the strong grasp, and
knelt on the bare verandah boards.
“You believe in training up a child in the way
he should go, even if it isn’t your way, eh, Price?”
chuckled the guest.
TheC.C., though Dr. Hampton was his official
superior for the time being (inasmuch as that
Lesser Providence to 40,000 souls, the Governor
of Van Demonia, had entrusted to the ex-convict-
ship-surgeon the potential duty of reporting on
the “ moral state of Norfolk Island ”), imperiously
hushed him into silence.
“I believe in religion,” he said, “for children
and transports.”
And the Doctor good-humoredly—for Price was
a useful official—accepted the snub, with a re-
joinder—
“ Who, after all, are only children of a larger
growth. They’ve to be fed, and put to bed, and
whipped and locked up like children. But I’m
interrupting—go on, my little boy !”
“I’s not you’s ’ittle boy—l’s fa’vers—isn’t I,
fa’ver ?”
“Yes, yes ! But say your prayers, sonnie !
You’ll get cold here. _ Hadn’t you better say them
to mamma or nurse, inside.”
“No, fa’vei, for Danny tol’ me to say my new
pwayer to you wery ownself, fa’ver.”
“ Well, well, go on !”
# # *
The child whispered the Lord’s Prayer.
His little head, curl-crowned, was reverently bent
above his pressed palms.
After the one prayer, which has been the voice
of all men in all the ages of Christendom, he
whispered his—
Gentle Jesus, meek and mild,
Look ’pon, ’ittle chil’.
and thereafter, his piping struggling with drowsi'
ness, his
“ God b’ess fa'ver, mu’ver, ’ittle sister, Sir John
Fwan-in, where’s he ever is, an’ Lady Fwan-in,
an’ all—dear fr’ens—” The curls, burdened by
sleep, fell upon the loosened hands, and the child-
ish accents dropped.
# # #
The father stooped to lift the boy, when
Hampton, curious, said loudly—
“ You haven’t said your new prayer, my little
man !”
The child, aroused, rubbed his knuckles into his
eyes, and murmured a response.
“Oh, no—l’s a-forgettin’. I’ll say it now,
fa’ver !”
He slipped again to the floor, and, putting him-
self once more into the posture of prayer, breathed
with a palpable reverence which made the words
doubly terrible.
“ God, p’ease damn John Price !”
# * *
It’s a toss-up who developed a more
refined capacity for cruelty—John Price or some
of the transports whom John Price trained.
# * *
When Dr. Hampton was Governor of
Western Australia he was accustomed to remark
that never had he known or heard of John Price
flinching, except on two occasions. The first was
on a certain day in Tasmania, whose history we
have yet to tell. The second was on this night.
The father shrank visibly as the child’s voice
breathed its innocent malediction. The pallor of
his face was not that of the moonlight alone.
“Danny-taught—you—to say that?” he ques-
tioned the laddie.
But the child’s head pressed against his knees
in slumber. The father gathered the boy into his
arms, and carried him into the house. As he
placed the little fellow in his cot he paused,
battled with himself for a moment as to whether
he could touch those lips which had emitted so
poignant a sting, and then, stooping, kissed the
rich redness of their curves and dimples.
The child, semi-roused, stirred, and murmured
caressingly—“Fa’ver !”
# * *
“What are you going to do with the
pris’ner who put him up to saying that ?” ques-
tioned Hampton as the Commandant came forth
again to the verandah.
“Wait!”
“Why?”
“Because I can’t punish the scoundrel now
without confronting him with the child. Doing
that would fix the—the —thing in the little cove’s
mind, and would help him to remember it. The
words will slip away from his recollection if I do
nothing to impress them upon him. Besides-—.’
“What?”
“ To reveal to the pris’ner that he has ” —-He
paused again.
“Hurt you?” suggested Hampton, with that
delicate malevolence, like a feline claw-scratch,
which was one of his characteristics.
“If you like —sir!” Price was compelled to
remind himself the doctor was not only his
superior, but his guest. “To let him know that
he has hurt me—as you say—would be to incite
every servant I have to play me the same trick.
Don’t you know, Doctor, with all your experience
of pris’ners, that the way to break ’em of a trick or
practice not expressly prohibited by regulation is
to say nothing about it? And that if you punish
’rn for it, you’ll give it an increased importance in
their eyes ?”
As an administrator in a large way, and truly
meriting Mr. Gladstone’s encomium that “ he was
thoroughly qualified for the most responsible
offices in connection with convict discipline,”
Hampton was accustomed to consider himself
John Price’s superior, but he deferred to the C.C.
in all matters of precise knowledge. He said so
now, and not so much fearful that Price would be
excited to an unusual exercise of magnanimity, as
curious as to the way he should punish the con-
vict who had invented this newest devil’s trick,
asked the Commandant “Was he prepared to
overlook the matter?”
“I said I would wait,” replied Price.
# * #
All things come to the man who waits.
Daniel Duncan, lifer, per Westmoreland, was
one of the four men allowed by Grace of the
Authorities to the Commandant for domestic
service. He had been selected by the previous
Commandant, and Price had retained him in the
entourage of Government Cottage till he had seen
whether he could be replaced by a more deserving
man —that is to say, in the language of the
System, a man who was likely to be more useful
in the house.
Unfortunately for Danny, such a man. was not
long in presenting himself to the Commandant’s
august notice. Somebody or other, who was so
contemptible a creature in the keen eyes of the
Lords of Evil, as to be awarded by them a mere
trifle of seven years’confinement amid the beauties
of the island, was discovered to possess a pretty
faculty for artistic gardening. He had suggested
one or two striking means of improving the view
from the Cottage, and, as the System was always
anxious to improve upon Nature, he was to bo
granted a chance of gilding refined gold, by being
told off to reduce the tangled exquisiteness of
the pine-glades, and the honeyed sweetness of
the spice-land, to the order so beloved of Penal
Officialdom.
Now, Order is a very fine thing, and, as a vile
body on which the Regime had performed count-
less experiments, with the object of instilling a
sense of orderliness into his soul, Daniel Duncan
should have been appreciative of Mr. Price’s
motive in superseding him by the other prisoner.
But even so admirably-devised a plan of
morality, as was comprised in the Transportation
System, could not eradicate from Duncan’s nature
that tendency towards selfishness which the less'
pious surroundings of his youth had encour-
aged. Instead of meeting Mr. Price half-way, so
to speak, and welcoming his relegation to the
gaol-cell as an opportunity for enjoying that self-
communion which is so essential to the culture of
good character, he resented his removal. And
resenting it, had directed the innocence of the
Commandant’s little child into the channel of
cursing. Of course it was not prudent of Danny
to act in this fashion, but wherever, since the
epoch of Eden, did splenetic man act prudently ?
He knew it was imprudent, and he knew, more-
over, that it was damnable to teach child-lips to


*Wet Quarry.—The work in the quarry was so destruc-
tive to the (jankers’ clothes that, in the mercy of the
System, they were permitted a second or working suit
made of condemned blankets ! The comfort and protec-
tion afforded by clothes composed of materials too rotten
to be served out to a Norfolk Island dormitory may be
inferred, but not valued !

syllable imprecations. And with all his know-
ledge, he risked the consequences of the impru-
dence for the sake of the damnableness. Which
was a corollary of the System.
# * *
He knew it was the beginning of the con-
sequences when, standing on the verandah-steps,
the morning after the night, the Commandant
said, smilingly; “Make the most of your last
day, Duncan ! You go into the gaol-gang to-
morrow.”
The prisoner looked defiantly into the disc of
unrimned glass—and trembled as he saluted.
“ Yes, sir ! ”
“ And, Duncan ”
“ Sir ! ”
“You are fond of children, Duncan?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Then, as you have, I believe, served the cot-
tage pretty well, you shall have one indulgence,
Duncan —the youngsters shall come over some-
times. But no more prayers, Duncan, no more
prayers.” _ ,
Duncan, though the world was singing in its
warm bath of sunlight, shivered again, and bowed
his head over the mattock. He regretted his im-
prudence now.
# * *
Thi’ee days later the main guard—-the
gaol—turned out as Dr. Hampton and the Com-
mandant arrived to inspect.
“Muster!” ordered the C. 0., speaking to
Assistant-Superintendent Tuff.
The occupants of the gaol, saving those waiting
trial who were doubly-ironed in the cells, were
ranged in the corridor.
The authorities intended to “re-form the gangs”
that day, and “ out ” labour had ceased for the
time being—a circumstance which was unpalatable
to Tuff and disastrous to Danny Duncan. For
the gaol-men were usually mustered by their
gangs, and Tuff’s special lot for muster could be
comprehended by a glance, and he could rattle off
the names from the muster-book as though he
were reading them. Read them he could not,
unless they were written in text-hand. With
forty men, however, to call over, this mechanical
process was impossible, and he could not read the
names from the roll, because the entries were
made in a running hand.
“ Muster!” repeated the Civil Commandant.
Tuff, saluting in deprecatory tones, informed their
Honors that “ the names wasn’t large ’nuff, for his
weak eyes to see, yer Honors.”
“ Weak eyes ! ” echoed the Commandant. “ I
didn’t know you had weak eyes.”
“ Yes, sir ! But they’re jest come on, sir !
They’ll be better shortly, sir !” And Tuff vowed
to himself that he would give some of the hospital
rations of rum and tobacco to some convict to
coach him in reading “ small-hand.” “Be better
shortly, sir. An’ shall one of the men read over
sir ? ”
The Commandant took no notice of the question,
but pursued his motive of enquiry.
“ Just come on, has the weakness ! Now, how
weak are they ? Look at Duncan there, Duncan
41—392, Duncan of the Westmoreland. Can you
see that bar of steel —a dangerous weapon
specially prohibited by regulat on to be in the
possession of pris’ners—which he has?”
Tuff looks stupidly at Duncan ; Duncan regards
himself as stupidly ; there is a forward craning of
necks down the line, as crows ranged on a rock,
might protrude their beaks to watch the turning of
a living substance into carrion.
For a second there is nothing to be seen by any-
one; Duncan’s hands are, as per regulation,
clapped at his sides. Where, what, can be the
bar of steel ?
The Civil Commandant, John Price, steps for-
ward, pauses an instant to adjust his eye-glass,
and with his index-finger touched the fatal
object.
"Present this pris'ner after muster for having
in his possession a dangerous weapon, and report
yourself to the Doctor forthwith, Mr. Tuff, in
order to have that weakness remedied. It’s time
something was done to correct your sight when
you allow pris’ners—and gaol-gangers above all
others—to carry bars of steel on their persons.
Give me the book !”
# # *
The muster began, proceeded, ended.
And then Duncan, Daniel, No. 41 —392 per West-
moreland, was presented at Court. Assistant-
Superintendent Tuff presented, and Civil Com-
mandant, John Price, acting as magistrate, pre-
sided. And Dr. Hampton, as an interested
spectator, was accommodated with a seat.
“ Defence, pris’ner ?” demanded the Court.
“ What d’ye say ?”
“ Only that your boy brought it me—l was
a-making him sails for his toy boat when you
transferred me, sir, and the little chap, when he
see me yesterday, brought it me, sir, to finish
’em. From his mammy, he said, sir.”
“ You admit another offence as well ? Holding
communication with free person’s children is
illegal, and you know it. But we’ll leave that to
another day. No other defence ?”
The prisoner held his breath. So did all the
Court, save the Commandant and Dr. Hampton.
They breathed easily enough, you may depend.
Only a Secretary of State could affect their
respiration.
“ Then 50 lashes—and the wet quarry* for six
months —and the article to be forfeited. May I
ask your opinion, sir?”
“ A very proper sentence in my judgment,”
approved the Inspecting-Officer, “Very!” And
he gazed steadily into the eye-glass, and saw in the
steely eyes an interpretation of the sentence
which expressed his own mind. John Price had
waited only three days.
* * *
Fame is a product of accident. So is
infamy.
But it is questionable whether it was altogether
by accident that Danny Duncan, per Westmore-
land, became possessed of that common sewing-
needle—size No. 2.

an arrangement of iron bars in front of it, so that
the fresh air may get to the sausages and tripe and
the sheep’s kidneys ; and when you look through
these bars the faithful dog may be seen gambolling
over the chops and other things in an inspiriting
fashion. We don’t know whether he does this
every night—perhaps he was unusually lively the
evening we saw him, but on that occasion we
watched him for ten minutes, and he was leaping

LITTLE OE THE GUN; NOTHING OE
THE DOG.
When Rip Van Winkle awoke from his nap in
the Catskill Mountains in America, he found him-
self an old man. His dog was dead long ago, and
nothing was left of his gun but the lock and
barrel. And when he went back to the village of
Falling Water, where he used to live, nobody
recognised him. His wife, believing him dead,
had married an innkeeper. Right enough too,
for Rip had lain on the mountain-side, sound
asleep, for twenty years.
A long enooze ; but it seems to me I'd rather be
asleep half my life at a stretch than to stop awake
and be miserable. Yet here is a woman who says,
“ I can truthfully say that for eighteen years I
was never free from pain for a single day.”
Mercy ! think of that. What a wretched way
to live! Yet I suppose millions of folk crawl
along through the world in that style. Not be-
cause they want to. Heavens, no ! But because
they can’t help it. This was her situation, and
an army of other women (besides crowds of men)
ban sympathise with her.
She says : “ For over twenty years I was weak
and sickly. At first I had a bad taste in the
mouth, poor appetite, and an uncomfortable feel-
ing at my chest and sides, and often tried to
obtain ease by holding my sides with my hands.
After eating I had great pain ; it was like a load
at my chest, and I could not bear it until I
vomited all my food up. I would be quite faint
from the want of food but was ajraid to eat. At
times I had bad attacks of spasms which nearly
doubled me up, and I rambled up and down the
house for hours together, for I could not even lie
down. Of course I lost a deal of sleep, and in a
morning was so weak and faint I scarcely knew
how to get out of bed and downstairs. For
eighteen years I teas never free from pain for a
single day.
*• I saw doctor after do tor, and took a great
quantity of medicine without finding any real
relief. They would not say what was the cause of
my ailment. I was fast wasting away, and did
not think I could live much longer, when one day
in 1881 my husband heard from Mr. Joseph
Cooper, of Bourne, of a medicine called Mother
Seigel’s Curative Syrup, which he said had cured
him. c lf lam spared,’ I said to ray husband, ‘ I
will try it.’ I did so, and before I had taken the
first bottle I found relief, and after taking four
beetles more I was quite well and strong.
“ That is now ten years ago, and 1 have been in
good health ever since, taking just an occasional
dose of the syrup. After my recovery the clergy-
man said to my husband, “ Your missis gets
about very different to what she used to do,’and
lie told him that Mother Seigel’s Syrup had
wrought the cure. People tell me I look better
than I did twenty years ago, and I feel so strong
that I can now dig potatoes and do work with
. anyone, notwithstanding I am 65 years of age.
“ My husband suffered terribly from rheuma-
tism and flux, and has found wonderful benefit
from the same medicine. He says he would have
been in the churchyard long ago but for Mother
Seigel's Syrup. For myself, I can say it saved my
life, and 1 wish others to know what it has done
for me and mine. (Signed) Mrs. Esther Ayr,
wife of William Ayr, of Thurlby, near Bourne,
Lincolnshire.”
In this brief and simple way Mrs. Ayr tells a
story the full details of which would fill a book.
What hopes and fears ! what hours of keen sorrow
and deep darkness she must have experienced.
Yes, indeed. None can even imagine it except
those who belong to the great Sisterhood of Suffer-
ing. ’Where she mentions one symptom of her
disease she actually could have named a dozen.
F r her malady—the fearfully common and fatal
one, indigestion and dyspepsia—has as many signs
and forms as the mind iias fancies, or the heavens
have clouds. From it, as from sin, come a thou-
sand pangs and pains to torment and to crush
he’pless humanity. Seeing what her great dis-
covery has accomplished in this and multitudes of
like eases, how good a friend to her kind was
Mother Seigel ! Rip Van Winkle awoke from his
nap to find himself old ; Mrs. Ayr awoke from her
long night of illness to find herself young again.
Is -not the moral plain enough for all the suffering
millions in England?
Tho Tramcars.
(With apologies to Henry Lawson.)
I sit beside the window as the cars go fleeting by,
With lights that shine like meteors against the murky
sky;
And above the ceaseless clatter of a thousand hurrying
feet,
The wheels grind out a melody as they hurry down the
street.
VVith an endless clang and beat
Like an army's iron-shod feet;
There is horror in that melody grind out in the
street.
“ We come from dusty suburbs where the fields are brown
and bare,
And the ruined fences totter like wooden drunkards there,
And the garbage all is festering in the summer’s glare and
heat,
And we scatter dogs and infants as we speed along the
street.
And the people that we meet,
They bolt with hurried feet,
And we sometimes squash a cripple as we tear along the
street.
“ We come from foetid byways where the air is thick and
dank,
Where a knock-kneed race of people grow long and sad
and lank ;
And the dull and brutish faces that look out from their
retreat
Look like one great, sombre countenance as we travel
through the street,
For our wheels are fast and fleet,
And the soulless eyes we meet,
Seem like the eye of one lost soul as we fly along the
street.
“ We come from haunts of brass and iron and ashes dull
and gray',
Through smoke and blight and ancient rust we hurry on
our way ;
We run races, too, with corpses in the rain and slush and
sleet,
When some ancient pauper’s funeral is lumbering down
the street.
And with a yell we greet .
The “ deaders” that we meet,
As they jog on to a sloppy grave away far down the street.
“ We gather up all sorts and shapes of ugliness and sin,
We convey the fatted publican and take the leper in,
It matters not to us which are the tares and which the
wheat,
The Fiend can ride for twopence as we whiz along the
street.
And underneath the seat
He can shove his cloven feet,
And his trident counts as luggage as he journeys down the
street.”
I sit beside the window, and I listen to the song,
Of the jarring wheels that ever and for ever speed along.
And even in my dreams I hear the ceaseless roar and beat
Of spectral cars that clatter down a never-ending street.
Like an army's mad retreat
In the hour of its defeat,
An army ever rolling down a long, eternal street.

For the Cure of
All throat and lung diseases, Ayer’s Cherry
Pectoral is the best known remedy. When tho
bronchial tubes are sore and obstructed with
phlegm, this medicine is invaluable. It is an
anodyne expectorant, and. in cases of deep
seated consumption, it cures the coughing,
soothes and heals the lacerated tissues, and
induces refreshing sleep. A few doses are usu-
ally sufficient to afford speedy relief in cases of
Colds and Coughs
It ia_also as speedily efficacious, and prompt
to dl©y the distressing symptoms of asthma,
bronchitis, sore throat, hoarseness, croup, and
whooping cough, and, in thousands of fami-
lies, is the only cure used. It is the best emer-
gency medicine and should always be at hand.
No household in which there are young chil-
dren, can afford to be without

A Wine Song:
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Bearded brothers, fierce eyed brother.!, gather
round the board,
Let ns feast and reap tbo harvest that was
grown
Seventy summers since, in vineyards where the
sun
Kisses fiercer, kisses warmer, and the winds are
blown
Over scented fields of corn, reddening ’neath the
ruddy sun.
Ripe and red the sparkling sun glistens o’er the
fields of gold.
Hot the ruddy sun droops downward, heavy,
warm
On tho dead limbs of the dead trees, white-trunked,
worn,
By the bit’er, bleak and stormy winds of winter
tossed and torn.
Red the ruby wine is sparkling, brothers, let us
quaff
To tho memory that is rushing, to the memory
that is gushing,
With the rushing and the gushing cf the ruddy
wine,
Flushing with the rosclight, with tho face and
forehead flushing.
Raise your cups to him who with us,
When the earth was golden and the noontide
sky was blue,
Drank and sang, and warmed and pladdened,
In the days that maddened, in the days that
gladdened, in the days that flew.
Oh, the sad days ! Oh, tho mad days ! bitter with
the unshed tear,
Flaming with the flash of wrath, and fading sad
and sere.
Madder days we know not, merrier days we trow
not,
FJcw on pleasure’s pinions in the passing of a
year.
The bitter, bitter days, the ashen-tinted days,
When the redness of oar passion gloomed and
greyed,
When the ruddy wine no longer flew in foamy
froth asunder,
And the redness cf the rosy cheek began to
fade.
Wine and women, song and warfare, madness that
is cherished
By the high gods throned above us, by the king of
gods, the mighty
Jove, who hurls the thunder, with his hurtling
blast
Fear ye, brother ? Dread yo that ho smite ye ?
Tremble at his Furies? See them fast advancing—
Locks of knotted snakes and stony eyes that
fright -
Shall we dread the darkness? We who walked
unfearing,
Wo who met undrcadiiig all the ills of light?
Ho, the rubies sparkling ! Ho, tho roselight
flashing !
Harvest of the vine—the clustering vine that grew
Reddening hi \ath the ruddy sun and ripening
under skies of blue,
Flushing red and flashing redder under summer
skies of blue!
WANDERER.
G. R. Sims says that the motto of bigotry
and intolerance is—“ When in doubt, play hell.”
The Japanese have no humour. For
instance, the Governor of the province in which
the Czarovitch was so badly knocked about
recent y has been sacked, and ‘ Ids friends unani-
mously advise him to commit suicide.” A gentle-
man living in the to vn where the incident took
place felt so hurt about the disgrace to l)is locality
that he was starting for St. Petersburg to per-
sonally disembowel himself in the presence of the
Czar, and scatter his entrails over the carpet, and
was restrained from his purpose with difficulty.
The name of the town where the affair took place
has been altered, and the judges who tried the
assassin have resigned because they feel contami-
nated, and are also thinking of disembowelling
themselves in public. And nobody even smiles
at these proceedings. Fancy trying to run a
humorous paper in a country like that !

Sir Wilfrid Lawson styles the German
flag “the sears and swipes.”
The Victorian (Teetotal) Alliance had no
sooner swallowed their breakfast at Melbourne
Town Hall last week, than the company stood up
and sang “God Save the Queen.” In short, they
seized the earliest possible opportunity to express
their love for a lady who believes in wine and
whisky. Then a number of the more shining
lights ascended the platform, and Treasurer
Munro, who pays (out of the estimates) for as
much strong liquor as any entertainer in the
province, solemnly seated himself in the chair. A
very consistent performance all round.
The Bulletin issues this intimation as a
general answer to several hundred correspondents.
It does NOT want stories which consist entirely
of a bright-eyed girl who gets married and lives
happily ever afterwards. It doesn’t want tales
which are made up solely of a brutal outrage on
an abandoned goldfield ; or tales about a pale,
repentant girl under a lamp-post on a wet Xmas
night, with a wailing illegitimate infant in her
arms ; or tales about that perennial small boy on
the same date, who sleeps out on a doorstep, and
is found there by a fat, impossible philanthropist.
It also objects to narratives about the honest
selector who hugs his best girl over a gate.
Manuscripts concerning the same old digger who
suddenly finds a big nugget just when he is dead-
broke, will be put in the waste-paper basket.
Manuscripts concerning bland and harmless
curates will be shied out of the window. Manu-
scripts that depend entirely on mangled remains
and bones and similar police-court slush will be
fired into the stove. Anybody who has a really
humorous tale or episode to tell is cordially invited
to tell it. Anybody who has a thrillingly pathetic
tale, or a gruesome tale which is wildly original
and yet not coarse or offensive, is invited to tell
it also. Anybody who has any other kind of a
tale is invited to coil it up and sit upon it, and for
ever hold his peace. This last remark isn’t
original exactly, but it expresses the situation to
perfection. Another thing: The Bulletin doesn’t
offer a prize for the best story, arid then calmly
annex gratis all the other competitive stories sent
in. If it prints a story it pays for it.
Sydney Parthenon, a ladies’ paper, with
a picture of a female in a night-dress on the
cover, publishes four columns of remembersome
slush about the flight of that strange gang of
defeated assassins, who went into Manipur to
arrest a friendly statesman by treachery in the
midst of his own council, and didn’t manage it.
The back end of this “poem” is made up of
allusions to the writer’s gracious queen, and the
front bit is mostly technicalities out of a Hindu-
stanee lexicon. It is a wild, soulful song, but a
good deal disfigured by things like this :
Out from the land of the peepul and jungle,
Where the sleek tiger steels swift through night s gloom,
Out from the land where the wild nullah mingles
Its toofau-swung tides with the nuddee’s dull boom,
When ’mid the hills of the Luohais and Kukis,
Where the gentle tatao sleeps soft through the night,
Its last remnant fled—nor copaya—nor palki.
Nor obsequious biggaree had part in that flight.
There are whole ass-loads of pathos in the picture
of these lost fugitives skedaddling by night over
the hills without any biggaree, and with the
nuddee making a sheol of a row in the distance,
and the other articles hereinbeforementioned per-
vading the premises. We can see them in our
mind’s eye. The goshwallop was hanging round,
also the slork and the gampstraggler, and other
savage animals and bits of Asiatic languages.
There were long polysyllables glaring fiercely from
the trees with their hair hanging down their backs;
and tameless nine-jointed expressions barked at
them in the ditches : and dark, fierce, bloodshot
hunks of grammar chased the flying heroine and
her friends. Most of them had left their bull-
whizzle behind, and there were women weeping
bitterly in that night-march for the loss of their
hogbroggalyskew—we forget the rest of the word,
but it doesn’t matter. Our Hindustanee gives out
here, too, and we can’t go another yard.
According to an English paper. Her
Gracious Goodness was lately pleased to command
that a certain Tuesday “should be Collar Day.”
The Bulletin always thought that, for Victoria,
every day was Collar Day.

The Beggar.
(After Turgenief.)
A loathsome beggar stops me in the way
In unclean rags, with tearful, bloodshot eyes,
The mean lines of his haggard face betray
Revolting vice and want. His whining sighs
Fill me with hate. With hold, disgusting lies
He stretches forth his swollen, dirty hand
And begs for alms in shrill, distressing cries.
By chance without a coin, perplexed I stand,
Till, by an all-compelling impulse caught,
I grasp the hand and say in kindest tone :
“ Forgive me, brother, I can give thee naught.”
He smiles as if a jewel had been thrown.
“ You give me, brother, more than I have sought.”
Then I, too, find a brother’s gift my own.
TWENTIETH CENTURY.
The Prodigals.
When the roses of summer were budding and blooming
And the yellow wheat bent ’neath its burden of gold,
The Prodigal Son came, world-weary and tattered,
To the home where his footsteps had echoed of old.
And they clung to his garments wdth tears and caresses,
Till the cup of his welcome ran over with joy,
And the flowers of love and forgiveness were woven
In the blossoming crown for the Prodigal Boy.
When the icicles hung from the eaves and the branches,
And the winter winds moaned round the dwellings cl
men,
Forsaken and homeless, the Prodigal Daughter
Crept back to the home of her girlhood again.
But they turned her away in the storm and the darkness
To the icy-cold winds with their chill, piercing breath,
And the pitiless curses that followed her footsteps
Were fierce as the tempest and cruel as death.

I.
O human lover, thou hast peace at last!
Tho’ we should pray or murmur low and deep,
We wake no echoes down that vale of sleep—
The near dominion of the awful past,
The solemn waste outfolded dim and vast,
Where Thought sows daily but may never reap
One precious seedling from its barren steep,
Nor hear one answer to its questions cast.
But thou hast left us from thy life fulfilled,
That rose ascendant and proclaimed aloud
Time’s only message to the witless crowd,
Truth, old and new, earth’s bravest souls have willed.
And tho’ thy voice be now for ever stilled,
Thy songs are wrapped not in thy silent shroud.
11.
Because no eyes shall see thee, and no ears
Shall hear again that lyric voice of thine—
Earth’s gift more holy than of aught divine—
We bow not down with unavailing tears ;
We love not more than in those quickening years
When thy pure songs, for Earth’s high human shrine,
The newer music and the last, in fine,
Fell clear and full ’mid all that mortal hears.
From naked depths to heights of life sublime,
From righteous duty and from brutal wrong,
Rose shapes and symbols for thy fervent song.
O human-poet in the front of time
Shall not thy notes in its new paeans chime?
Amid the singing of brave hearts and strong.

Sir Baclic CunartI was asked why the
Cunard line, in 50 years, never lost a passenger
through any of its accidents, and his reply was—
“ Because we never employ cheap men.”
Some thrilling scenes would have been
observed, if there had been daylight during the
terrible disaster in Port Phillip last week. It is
impossible of course for them all to be recorded,
and the experiences and the agony of some of
those even who escaped the rush of waters to-
wards the “gut” will never be known to the
world at large, In the case of one man—a poor
wretch who was going steerage to meet his wife
in the southern capital, after long months of
separation—never did the waves have their cruel
grasp withdrawn after a more bitter struggle.
Poor fellow. He desires to have his name with-
held. But his was a terrible night. He had seen
that the boat was well inside the Heads, and that
he would probably wake up in the morning to find
himself alongside the wharf in the Yarra, and he
meant to sleep soundly, dreaming no doubt of the
welcome which would await him by those from
whom he had been separated, owing to want of
work at home, for nearly 12 months past. Then
came the sudden crash, the start of terror, the cry
“all hands on deck,” and half dazed, half blinded,
with nothing to cover him but his shirt and
trousers, he rushed upstairs forgetting his hard
earned money and his all, in the struggle for dear
life. But even now he could see that there was a
strong probability that he could not get on to one
of the boats ; and eventually he only became
with difficulty one of the occupants of the ill-fated
life-boat which turned turtle, and he was thrown
out into the open bay. He was a cool man and a
brave one, however, and—seeing that in a few
moments the ship must go down, and he would be
sucked into the vortex if he remamed close to
her - ho struck out, being a fairly good swimmer,
in the hope that he would be picked up later on.
At this point began a struggle which he felt later
must end in death. He soon felt the effect of the
current towards the Heads, and do what he might
he seemed to be unable to fight the waves, and
keeo within a range in which he could hope to be
rescued. There was not a plank, or a hencoop, or
anything to sustain him, and at the end of an
hour his strength was rapidly diminishing. But
he held up bravely, and struggled on, giving a
cry for help now and again, and anon almost
swooning away from exhaustion. It was in fact
in such a condition that he was picked up by a
rescue boat finally, as he was floating, almost
senseless, bn the surface. When he recovered, he
said that he would to the end of his days bless the
time that he had spent in Sydney. Asked as to
his reason for this he said that during the ten or
eleven months he had been here, he had almost
constantly attended the Natatorium swimming
baths in Pitt-strest, summer and winter, and
though he could scarcely swim a stroke when he
started, he was able by his constant practice to
learn enough of the art to carry him through that
awful time. There are doubtless others amongst
the saved who can also testify to the advantage
they have derived from attending the baths at
this institution.
Baldness may be prevented, and a thick growth
of hair stimulated, by the use of Ayer’s Hair
Vigor. This preparation also restores the natural
color to gray hair, and renders it soft, pliant, and
glossy.

SWORN CERTIFICATE.— One of Thousands more.
To H. F. Kugblmann, Esq.
Dear Sir,—This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. I consulted
more than one doctor, and during that time took a great
quantity of medicine ivithout it doing me the slightest
good, but I became worse every day, wasting away until
I became a perfect skeleton. About February last I began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I
was expectorating every day, I became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. I agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. At the
end of three months I was taken bad one morning, and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time I commenced to improve, and
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, I am as well as ever.
Declared and subscribed before me, one of Her Majesty’s
Justices of the Peace, for the Southern Bailiwick, in the
County of Grant, this 10th day of December, 1888.
