Fox Bill Jim's Memorial
that asked this page to dis-
cover fa/fWitnUe inscription for its Billjim
monument, has range of choice.
The selections seDt in naturally fall into
two classes: Quotations from Australian
writers, and original compositions. Many
of the former class are fine enough in senti-
ment, but unsuitable for this particular pur-
pose. The obvious reason is that the poets
did not design their rimes for mortuary pur-
poses.
The following are the best of the quota-
tions from our poets:—
For those who gave their gallant aid in
honor, not in hire.
Will H. Ogilvxe.
Submitted by Clias. Chauvel.
They were the squadrons of the dawn,
They were the vanguard of the day.

(Extract from Anzac Book.)
Submitted by Ted Manning.
In honor's name, for honor’s shining sake,
For us your yielded youth is gathered up,
Like to the wine in God’s uplifted cup,
Which kneeling at His altar steps we take.
Mabgabet Ruth Betts.
Submitted by S. W. McAlister.
From torrents thundering at his birth,
And red drought ravening while he played,

The bravest thing God ever made—
An Australian.
Will Ogilvie.
Submitted by M. M. Glassford.
They came as lovers come, all else forsaking,
The bonds of home and, kindred proudly
breaking;
They live in splendor lone —
The nation of their making,
Their everlasting throne!

Ah! when Death's hand our own warm hand
hath ta’en
Down the dark isles his sceptre rules

And let the dreamers dream!

Of nobler futures. ’l’was for us they died.

These there were, who lost their everything.
Gave all! and left the earth a vaster sphere
In memories: ....
’Twas not the shed of blood, but fearless
mirth
That set a wondrous pattern to the earth.
And these, within a corner that is theirs,
Are laid in smiling peace-—a rich content.
The pain has been —the glory is.
I,EON GELLERT.
These lines were submitted by H. G.
Timms, by C. V. Jervis and by Ethel G.
Norman, reaching us in that order. But
H. G. Timms included two lines that Ethel
G. Norman was wise enough to omit:
... .Old cares
Have dropped, and left no drooping wonder-
ment.
And C. Y. Jervis merely entered the whole
poem, “The Dead.” and certain quotations
from it, not so suitable as that selected by
Ethel G. Norman.
W. F. Anderson asks for a relaxation of
the rule that the quotation must be from an
Australian author, in order to enter General
lan Hamilton’s historic cable, just after the
Landing:—•
“Speaking out of a full heart, may I be
permitted to say how gloriously the Aus-
tralian and New Zealand contingents have
upheld the finest traditions of our race
during the struggle still in progress. At
first with audacity and dash, then with
sleepless valor and untiring resource, they
have already created for their countries an
imperishable record of military virtue.”
Sir lan Hamilton.
The following include the best of the
many original compositions submitted :
They died; to live imperishably in our
hearts, achieving grandly, sacrificing nobly;
their souls are God’s; their deeds our race’s
long inheritance.
F. W.
Australia! Measure not the lives of these
soldier sons of yours by length of days, but
by their glorious deeds,' and thank God for
the mothers who reared such men to set your
standard high. •
Six-and-Eight.
Any old failure can live, but it takes a
man to fight, smile and die.'
E. Y. O’Brien.
Counting the cost,
They have gone out into the black night
war,
With light on their faces.
They have died,
Butdying, have raised before the nations
new people
By whose hands the despoilers are slain
And the widowed and fatherless are fed.
R.B.
Honored and loved,
They did their bit.
S. Corrigan.
To the men from the land of wattle and
sunshine who suffered and died for the
World’s Freedom,
To our sons, brothers and mates,
Salute f
K.
Australians! Pause oft before these
names, for while your nation wore its swad-
dling-clothes, these of her sons, to early
manhood grown, gave np their virile lives
that you might see Australia’s destiny.
Yablton Rayment.
Our glorious Dead ennoble us. High pride
Trumpets their names who for Australia
died.
Mary W. L. Roper.
For them the journeying over leagues of
heaving sea, for them the death in that first
charge up bristling cliff and spur, for them
the long, cold nights in lands afar, the days
of rain and nights of storm —for us the
quiet streets of towns we love, the sunshine
of the bush, the song of birds: they lost all
these for honor’s sake. Shall we not prove
worthy of those who exchanged for the quiet
streets, the ocean; for the sunshine of the
bush, the star-shell’s light; for the song o]
the birds, the thunder of the gunsf Shah
this not be our watchword: Carry on!
R. L. Jamieson.
Salute!
Here's luck!
So long!
Z. Z.
To live nobly is man’s duty. To die as
thfjge, sealing the test of young nationhood, is
the noblest life of aU.
Ernest Osborne.
What is lifet But a day upon a waggon
behind a lazy team of bullocks and a camp
at night beneath its shelter from which
there is no awakening to a mortal day; but
a soldier’s death upon the field of battle is
a glorious gallop at the dawn of day with a
leap into Eternity.
Edgar L. Stevens.
Mates !
We did our bit.
It’s up to you to carry on —
To prove Australia worthy—not of us,
But of our sacrifice!
So long!
Zip.
These have lived and fought and died.
They have drunk full all that life can give.
Why weep? We cannot have more,
And we, too, must die.
Edgar L. Stevens.
In a hundred ways the names here in-
scribed are endeared to us, recalling as they
do once familiar forms athrob with love and
laughter. But in far-off days when other
eyes alight hereon and other lips pronounce
these names may it be said: “Australia still
cherishes the memory of her noble dead who
hewed a way for Liberty.”
, Simon.
Note these for this our land have rounded
off their noble lives in a decorous death;
and laid it upon us to show their sacrifice
has not been vain.
Ethel Pawley.
They rest behind the rampart of the years,
They ask for neither monument nor tears;
Only that we who use the track they cut
Shall justify their sacrificed careers.
F. C.
Not abject age, nor manhood’s slow decline,
Could cloud their destiny:
Dying in life’s full tide, as One divine,
They died to make men free.
Guy Innes.
To follow unflinchingly the call of duty, to
suffer cheerfully, fight courageously, and to
die without fear —that is immortal.
OUYAH.
They gave their all.
Let you who pass, saluting here their names,
See that through you no slur, nor stain, nor
shame
Falls on the land for which they gave their
lives —
Australia.
G. M. Johnston.
What we freely offered, we have given.
Wm. Eason.
Australians! Brothers! Have us in re-
membrance. Rear your sons to follow the
road tve died to keep clear.
Helen M. Thompson.
Rita Sunyasee submits inscriptions not for
a roll of honor, but for the grave of a
Billjim:—
With thousands of cobbers he fighting fell
Giving the Germans a taste of Hell! —
Content was he to throw a seven
Heedless of haloes, Hell or Heaven!
Climbing the giddy heights o’ Fame,
Blazing his country's deathless name,
This devil-me-care, amazing euss,
Played war’s grim game —•
Who for?—
FOR US'
One correspondent suggests a roll of ill-
fame for the shirkers. On the hero’s roll of
honor would be the words, “We scrapped for
honor”: on the shirkers’ roll the legend
would be, “We scrapped our honor.”
Jt
This page’s choice lies between the entries
of G. M. Johnston, F.C:, Helen M. Thomp-
son, Edgar L Stevens (“What is Life?”)
and the quotations from L.L. and Leon
Gellert. L.L.’s brief lines make a moi’e
direct appeal than Leon Gellert’s finer
poetry. L.L.’s is more suitable, too, for a
Billjim memorial. Edgar L. Stevens’s splen-
did metaphors are splendidly Australian;
but the sentiment expressed—merely a glori-
fication of a soldier’s death —would be
equally suitable for a monument in Potsdam.
Helen M. Thompson, F. O. and G. M.
Johnston all express the same idea. F.C.’s
first line is hardly necessary; and Helen
M. Thompson’s rendering has not the dignity
or the noble cadence of that of G. M. John-
ston. The prize is therefore awarded to
G. M. Johnston, which turns out to be a
pen-name adopted by Mrs. T. de Burgh,
Wangat, N.S.W.
Tamworth, however, will make its own
choice.
This page cordially commends to our vari-
ous Education Departments and to parents
Jane Ada Fletcher’s Nature and Adventure
for Beys and Girls (Macmillan). The
author not only knows the wild life of the
Australian bush but knows how to write
about it in a way to gain the kiddy’s in-
terest. Her first story, “The Departing
Birds,” tells charmingly of the amazing
annual migrations of our swallows to the
northern hemisphere. At the touch of winter
our swallows and other swift-flying birds
journey to India, Timor, the East Indies,
even to the tundras of Siberia. Books such
as these —and few are so attractive and so
interesting or so well illustrated by actual
photographs—are invaluable for the Austra-
lian kid; though before our bird-life becomes
part of our children’s lives the question of a
less clumsy nomenclature should be settled.
Here is an immediate and congenial task for
our naturalist societies—or, better still, for
a committee of expert Abo.-w T riters.

Alfred J. Taylor, chief librarian of the
Hobart Public Library, publishes a pamph-
let, Epilepsy and Crime, in order to call the
attention of the Bench to the recent conclu-
sions of medical science that crime may be
committed by a person subject to epilepsy
without the patient’s knowledge of his
act, that an outburst of passion, during
which the crime may be committed, may
occur in place of an ordinary epileptic fit,
and that thus there arises the grave possi-
bility of the occurrence of a miscarriage of
justice. He supports his statement with the
conclusions of medical experts.
The same author publishes an enlarged
edition of The Effective Use of Sulphur in
the Prevention and Cure of Consuinption
(Daily Post, Collins-street, Hobart; Is.).
He makes out a good case for his simple
cure—burning sulphur in the patient’s room
each night. Is the medical profession in-
terested ?
♦
“Ex-Dominie”: I am with “Chink” in his attack
upon the utterly un-Australian aspect, outlook and
atmosphere of The State School Magazine op
October issue (Bird-month number) of
the N.S.vV. School Paper is a flabby apology for
an Australian Bird Number. The few Australian
contnoutions appear to have been inserted apologeti-
a j lf “Chink” only knew the High Persons of
the Sydney Education Head Office as well as the
writer used to before he secured more congenial and
more lemunerative work, he’d quite understand that
even a small amount- of ardent Australianism is
frowned upon by the official heads.
The kiddy verses of Furnley Maurice, pub-
lished as The*Bay and Padie Book, illustra-
ted by Vera Hamilton and Cyril Dobbs
(Endacott, Melb.), are interesting. A flew?
as will be seen, are excellent. The author,
instead of confining himself either to the point
of view of the child-mind, or that of the adult
that finds humor in the child-mind, attempts
to embrace both audiences. And these two
audiences are worlds apart. Hence this is
not a book for children. It is doubtful
whether they could see the humor or be inter-
ested in the view-point of the' nrojjority of
these verses. The adult will. The illustra-
tions are sometimes quite charming; and the
get-up of the book is delightful.
Architecture, the official journal of the
Institute of Architects of N. S. Wales and
four other States, fills a useful place. The
September issue insists that Sydney must
take seriously to flat-building in order to
relieve the congestion that is coming. San
Francisco’s example is held up for imita-
tion. Most of the thousands of flats in
Sydney are impossibly expensive, and are
not at all modern or complete. The result
is that they are unprofitable, since they are
so often vacant. The author insists that
flats should have a continuous hot-water
supply, disappearing wall-beds, vacuum-
cleaners, large basements, lifts, and steam-
heat. And rents of up-to-date flats need
not be as high as are now charged for the
pi’esent inconvenient flats, since rents (and
profit) could be calculated on a basis of
permanent tenancy. The present exorbitant
rent-charges are due to the huge demand and
the necessity of allowing for frequent
periods during which flats arq untenanted.
Australian
Kenneth Scott, author of War Verses and
Others (Hassell, Adelaide), expresses himself
beautifully, but has nothing to say. His sim-
iles are commonplace, his metaphors muddy.
He writes correctly of war and death and
God, but there is no thrill in his verses. He
is best —as all cold writers are—in the son-
net form. Here is a sample, with four rimes
in the octette—in this page’s judgment
among the best in the book
TO THE FALLEN.
Live on, heroic dead, where’er you dwell.
Mindful that yet the thankful earth is bright,
Illumined with your fame. Nor day, nor night
Steals from the world without a tongue to tell
Some eulogy of you with pride or pain.
What faintest British heart could e’er forget
The blood you gave for us; the ghastly fret
That stormed your souls, and which you fought
amain ?
Now you are hallowed names, above the powers
And ceaseless trials of the tedious years,
That still surround us with their untold woes:
You are the dead who would not have our tears;
The purchasers of Peace which must be ours; '
The envied faithful in your long repose.
Kiddy Songs by Furnley Maurice
SUNDAY DINNER.
The butcher corned and he bringed Up
But he crawled in the
And he patted ms hand among theVfLr
And catchcd the father hen. 1 ■
He catched it as hard as anything
But it didn't once crowed at all
And he tied its feet with a bundle of strinn ’
And hanged it up on the wall, n °
And now and again its wings went g nn
But that didn't frighten me! l '’
I rnnned for my little brother chav
To come outside and see.
The father hen's not crowing now
The ittooest ittoo bit; ’
We're going to tell our father hoic
The butcher's hurted it!
Our father has mended the bathroom door
And the leg of the rocking chair-
He mended the fence long time before
And he bought my horse some hair.
He made the bikes so they wouldn’t saueal
And he made the bunny to talk ■
He hammered some tacks in the engine wheel
When the engine couldn't walk.
And he cured the teddy when it teas dead
And he mended the barrow for me ’
So father will mend the rooster’s head
Before he haves his tea.
NONSENSE IMMORIAL.
From France, or Spain or the Himalayas
Out of the hearts of unknown loons, ' ’
In toothless mouths of old soothsayers,
On hairy lips of wandering players ’
Come the lullabies, come the croons.
Lords have lashed and poets have pondered
Blood has -flowed in the runnels deep, ’
Beacons have broken and faiths been sauan-
dered;
Through dank forests these songs have wan-
dered
Quietly crooning our babes to sleep.
Oi-andmother melodies, grandmother fancies
i Crooned by the Oxus ever endure!
Epics of valor and throne romances
Have much honor and take big chances,
But the clowns who sang for the 'babes
are sure.
The goblin speaks while in old caves moulder
Priest-made destinies and lord-made law ,
2he goblin leered from the monarch’s
shoulder
And, his sight being true and his young
heart bolder,
’ Ttoas only the goblin the baby saw!
So the god's death agonies are baby chatter!
A ball on the floor of the nursery room
The red earth rolls, for what can matter
If old John Spratt licks clean his platter
And the brown cows go to the broom?
BABY SONG.
The grandmas talked with worried dies
And said it teas a shame —
Nobody wanted Littley then
Before our Littley came.
Boyo's nose will be out of joint,
He’s a toddling baby yet,
And now there's another one coming along,
Poor little pet!
But Littley rode through the storm of doubt
And the cloud of the troubled brow;
Nobody wanted Littley then—
But you should hear them now!
From “The Bay and Padie Book.”

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S ‘FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

Trance.
The glassy panels of these office-walls
Patiently watch me with unblinking stare;
And here I’m seated in an office-chair,
Prisoned by trade in his barbaric halls.
No faeries gleam nor magian-whisper calls ;
Yet in a sudden trance afar I fare,
Dreamily wafted on wide wings of air,
While the grey world beneath me fades and
falls.
Then like a joyous ghost I wander free
Above the landscape of eternity,
Soaring and circling onward and away,
Until the stars are flecks of foam that fly
Up from the silvery cascades of the sky,
And life is but a sun-glint on the spray.
MAORILAND.
BARTLETT ADAMSON.
The Traveller.
By what mighty necromancy,
Lightning-like as any thought,
By what hand of golden fancy
Has this wonder-change been wrought?
Here was I engulfed and shrouded,
Chilled by mist around, above;
Every prospect walled and clouded —
Not a way that I might move.
Scared of stillness, scared of motion,
Neither might I stay nor shift;
Lost, as on a shipless ocean
Rudderless a boat may drift.
“Halt!” and “On!” cried inner voices
(No man lives but hearkens these) ;
“Death may be the best of choices —
Better death than stagnant ease!”
Thus I stood, the Moment proving
What I dare not, what I dare;
Thus I loathed to stand unmoving,
Thus I feared to forward fare.
Then—God’s love!—a wind came charging,
Shouting loud with shrill delight,
With a sudden sw r eep enlarging
Narrow ways to infinite ;
Showed me pathways, rugged, shrunken,
Cliff-walls, rock-falls, heights afrown;
Quicksands, where I might have sunken
Down and down and ever down.
, Showed. a roadway, broad and splendid,
Winding on by cliff and sea,
Where, auspiciously attended,
I might move secure and free.

A Love Song.
Yea, the old love is a cold love,
Though its embers smoulder still:
Which once burned like a beacon
On the summit of a hill;
For the man is disenchanted
When the lover has his will.
But the old days were as gold days;
For the eyes of love are blind
To the facts of human nature
In englamored humankind.
And the glories of illusion
Leave long memories behind.
Sweet the notion of Devotion —-
Flower fair that cannot fade,
Passing onward as an heirloom
From the mother to the maid.
By the law of human nature
Which must ever be obeyed.
Yea, the old love is a cold love,
Though its embers smoulder yet;
The hot sun of enchantment
In the western sky has set.
A debt was due to Nature
And Passion paid the debt.
Is the new love, then, the true love,
Whilst it holds your fancy fast,
Learning nothing of the future
In the lesson of the past?
Ay, the new love is the true love
For as long as it may last—
Till the old days are as gold days,
And a retrospective gleam
Of their bright, immortal gladness
Gilds the fabric of a dream.
Most facts of life are falsehoods,
And its truths the things that seem.
VICTORIA.
EDMUND FISHER.
The Vagabonds.
I was made for laughter,
And you were made for love!
The wind is blowing after,
The skies are clear above.
Wrens on happy feather
May flirt amid the green;
Golden is the weather
And golden is its queen.
Luck beats early rising.
What makes your lips so red?
O girl, you’re appetising.
And love must be fed.
Merry sunlight sprawling
O’er lands far away;
Somebody is calling
A king and queen to play.
Care’s a hoary sinner.
Leave him far behind.
AYe’ll have nought for dinner ;
But love’s sweet and blind —•
Love without a shilling—
And all the road is fair
If you’re laughter-willing
And we’ve a kiss to shgre!

“AUSTRALIA FIRST.”
Up to the beginning of this week it appeared
to The Bulletin as if the main result of a
lot of talk and print had been to tie the
community into a knot. Because an alarm-
ingly confused and garrulous stranger had
announced that “Australia should come
first,” fierce controversy was raging in news-
papers, tramcars and back yards concerning
the alleged disloyalty, wisdom or fatuity of
such a doctrine; and the beginning,
middle and end of the uproar seemed to be
decorated with a demented idea that any-
one who put Australian interests first had
good reason for voting “No,” and that a
citizen before answering “Yes” must have
arrived at the conclusion that “the Empire”
should be given the greater weight. Alto-
gether it was a weird sort of rumpus, the
most noticeable feature being a revelation
of the facility with which public sentiment
can be distorted until it is without a vestige
of meaning. But this paper is not going to
contemplate the opinions nearest Jo the
heart of every good Australian being dragged
into the gutter, nor see the loyalty of the
native-born to their country perverted to the
basest treachery, without lodging a caveat
against the proceedings. Nor is it, because
of a distaste for everything savoring of
sectarianism, going to be deterred from ex-
pressing its opinions on a subject which by
the accident of an individual’s clerical
status and controversial cunning ha£ lit the
flames of religious intolerance and bigotry.
Questions relating to the civic duty of the
Australian citizen and the public policy of
the Australian nation do not turn upon the
merits of a particular religion, and The
Bulletin puts aside as irrelevant the fact
that the man who started monkeying with
the phrase “Australia first” happens to be
the R.(\ Archbishop of Melbourne. It views
Dr. Mannix merely as Daniel Mannix,
and examines his social and political theories
without reference to his doctrinal beliefs.
* * * *
Now, there could be no possible objection
to Mannix urging Australians to put their
country first in all things. Certainly The
Bulletin could find no objection, for it has
done this very thing itself week after week
for a generation and intends to keep on
doing it. Unless Australians can become
habituated to thinking in terms of Australia,
then their patriotism will be almost as poor
as that of the Esquimaux, their claim to
nationality bogus and their conceptions of
the future a disordered and nebulous dream.
With them Australia must come first. There
is, nevertheless, no question of the Empire
standing down, for. as the world of reality
stands to-day, the bedrock interests of Aus-
tralia are the interests of Britain and of
South Africa and of Canada. Nor are those
interests in any sense separated by cultiva-
tion of the strongest national feeling in
each separate country. A glimmering of this
has penetrated the minds of the wilder Im-
perialists since the war broke out. And
some apprehension of its real significance
seems to have taken root in the understand-
ing of equally wild individuals who, for
ulterior purposes, yearn to see Australians
become victims of a sham Nationalism
which would bring the Commonwealth to
ruin within a year after their lunacy had
become the ruling influence in public con-
duct. This is just where Mannix comes
in. He is an anti-Conscriptionist. He is a
Sinn Feiner. He regards the war as a
sordid affair of trade. He is entitled to his
selection of opinions on all these subjects.
But he is not entitled to claim exemp-
tion from the reproach of being a malignant
enemy of Australian Nationalism when he
presents the watchword of “Australia first”
in a setting as alien to Australian thoughts
as a kangaroo would be to the pastures of
Connemara. The case he puts forward is
this: —
You in Australia are Sinn Feiners. Ireland, for-
tunately or unfortunately, is part of the British
Empire. Now is the time for Ireland —now or never 1
Irishmen must put Ireland first. If there is a colli-
sion between you in Australia and the Empire, put
Australia first. Do not touch compulsory military
service with a 40ft. pole. Do not allow yourself to
be influenced by the suggestion that Germany might
win the war.
The meaning of all this is clear enough.
Mannix is telling the Irish-Australian that
if he puts Australia first he will not fight
for her—that he can best serve the Com-
monwealth by acting upon the theory that
in the war there is a cleavage between
Britain and Australia. Of course, other
things are meant, but they don’t matter just
now.
* * * *
The reply The Bulletin has to make is
to tell the native-born Australian that
Mannix, this newcomer to Australia, is not
putting Australia first when he opposes com-
pulsory military service, nor is he thinking
of Australia. He is inverting the patriotic
instinct of Australians —asking them to put
Australia out of their mind and forget that
they are Australian-born with all the obli-
gations to their country that birth and the
■ dest freedom imnose. To sneer at the
n who have gone to fight for Australia;
•f' ridicule the sincerity of the people’s
■ dmiration for the lads in that splendid
army of theirs; to scoff at the relief and
comfort that may be sent to the boys in the
trenches from their homeland —to do this is
bad and mean enough, Heaven knows. But
to tell an Australian that he is putting his
country first by abandoning his mates to
the enemy is almost blasphemous. Mannix
does not do this because he is a Roman
Catholic prelate. No more powerful in-
dictments of Germany have been made than
by men holding high places in the Roman
Catholic Hierarchy. Religion is not ar£
issue in this thing. It is a case of a man
whose hatreds have become an obsession, and
who would transfer them to Australia and
use Australia as his catspaw. If the “antis”
are proud of his assistance this paper does
not envy them their satisfaction. But it
would be well for them to remember that it
is betrayal of Australia that their fugleman
is preaching.
THE STATE.
When the families of Hairyfist, the cave-
man. and Blackwhiskers, the jungle-
prowler, got utterly tired of a diet of slugs
and watercress they combined together to
hunt down a pig. With the weapons at hand
a single family had a very poor chance of
rounding up pork by their unaided efforts;
but when all the members of both families,
from the patriarch down to the toddling
infant, got after the improved menu, they
had a big hope of success. That family com-
bine, out of which grew a sort of feeling
which, if not love, was wholly unlike the
usual hate and distrust of those remote
days, was the rudimentary form of the tribe
which was in turn the rudimentary form of
the State. In process of time the ambition
to slaughter and roast an elephant drew
family after family into the food union, and
the larger and more hairy persons or those
who possessed the greatest craft and cunning
were recognised as leaders. Then war came
along. Few animals war on their own
species. The female spider eats her husband
with great cheerfulness ; the busy bee, under
certain circumstances, makes a considerable
slaughter of its own innocent but useless
companions; the various tribes of ants battle
fiercely for glory and blunder and even make
slaves of the conquered. But the battles
among the higher animals, except in the case
of mankind, never get beyond the personal
scrap or at worst a faction fight. It was the
rivalry of the primitive States that led to
the institution of war as a regular human
pastime. It rankled in the breasts of the
people of the scrub country that the dwellers
among the rocks had more food than they
because they ran over richer hunting-
grounds. Man was easier to kHI than a m<r
and slower of fbot than a rabbit; and a sur-
prise attack could get rid of the hated hunt-
ing rivalry with a few sudden blows of the
stone axe and hardwood club. This gave a
new force and impetus to the idea of the
State. Broken remnants of defeated tribes
combined in bitterness of heart to smash one
of their conquerors. Bigger and bigger chiefs
rose with every triumph of blows or cunning,
and the State became associated with the
titles of kings and other bosses —hairy-
chested or deep-eyed men who grabbed the
largest part of the spoil and took the heavi-
est risks in the dangerous business of living.
Then war became War, and organised
slaughter drove the peoples into closer and
closer unions and greater and greater depend-
ence on their leaders because of the awful
risks taken by the people who tried to occupy
even a cave outside the protected areas. The
citizens of the State thought of it in terms
of protection from the bigger evils; and when
that protection worked there arose a rudi-
mentary love of the nation and of nation-
hood, which blossomed at last into finest
patriotism.
Under the protection of the State grew
agriculture, industry and art. Citizens
acquired personal property; and certain of
the dangers which primal man combined to
avoid rose out of the natural greed and cun-
ning by which individual sought to beat his
fellow for his possessions. Not even under
the best protection from the outside foe was
a man sure that his throat wouldn’t be cut
or his hen-roost robbed. The State strove to
grapple with these dangers also, and the king
sat to judge all causes. YY T hen the causes
grew too many or the king too tired, judges
and courts were instituted, juries invented
and the whole elaborate machinery of the
law got into motion. Then some heavy-
thoughted persons with the joints of their in-
tellect a trifle stiff wrote books to convince
the people that the State existed for judg-
ment, as if the first alliance of Hairyfoot
and Blackwhiskers had been to get a
tribal pronouncement on the right of one to
take 161 b. of pork while the other had to
make a meal out of 111 b. Law and justice
were really late developments of the com-
munal life, and could never have existed
until the food combine and the war combine
for external defence were established on a
good foundation. But the need of law turned
the best-protected States to a consideration
of the business of law-making. The king’s
word was the first law —a law that remained
effective just as long as the man who shouted
it was effective. After that the king got his
relatives and pals to assist him in making
laws that would stay on even after the
makers were dead. That they should make
those laws to suit themselves was inevitable ;
and it was equally inevitable that in course
of time the people who counted for little as
individuals, but for a tremendous lot in the
aggregate, should rise up in wrath and take
the job of law-making into their own hands.
Thus the State achieved democracy, or
fancied it did, and, roaring loudly about
freedom, imagined that the whole landscape
was altered because it had tackled work of
whose intricacies it had only the most
shadowy sort of knowledge. The king might
act basely and play for his own hand; but
he and his companions had a very fair idea
of the game they were playing. The people,
on the other hand, knew a lot of things that
the king didn’t, and were a good deal more
honest about those things; but the State was
a conception that had got beyond them, and
an effective national consciousness was a
very difficult thing to create.
* * * *
Democracy’s chief danger lies in the fact
that it never very clearly grasps what it is
there for. The machine of the State with
a vast multitude of cranks and pinions had
come down from a remote past. Every age
some man with a large hand for affairs had
tried to fit it for the needs of his own time
or class or party, and the average citizen had
quite lost the purpose of the contrivance in
his contemplation of the elaborate mechan-
ism. Australian democracies have risen to
some height of purpose and enthusiasm in
certain directions; but never do the free
voters of this Commonwealth seem''to have
settled in their own minds what their politi-
cal system is all about, and to what ends it
works. There are immense possibilities
before the State that is rooted and grounded
in the intelligent co-operation of the people.
Wealth production on a scale hitherto un-
dreamt of, fine educational movements that
will leave no man a clod and no citizen
incapable of trained thought, large efforts
for public health and for the fostering of
the national soul’s health by encouraging
those things that are more than bread- —all
these the true State may accomplish.
But the State will do nothing effectively
and well until it understands why it is a
State. The old reasons for the organised
community are as strong to-day as they were
ten thousand years ago. The first purpose
of the State is to secure by co-operative
effort the means of living; the second to
secure an adequate defence against any pos-
sible foe. • Reading citizenship of the State
in the light of these facts, the citizen’s first
duty is to bear his share of the general work,
his second to bear his share of the general
defence. To absolutely eliminate idleness
the basest crime against the communal life
is clearly the first work of practical states-
manship ; and closely following upon it is the
Provision for adequate armed protection.
Within the past year the idleness caused by
strikes has been so much a feature of the
Australian manscape that the production
and distribution of the means of life was
seriously retarded, and little more than
twelve months ago the voters of the Com-
monwealth deliberately turned down a
national call to arms at the moment when
everything Australians cherish was seri-
ously endangered by a too successful foe.
Ihese grim facts furnish clear enough evi-
dence that the Australian democracy does not
know the foundations on which as a State
the whole community rests. The very best
laws dealing with other aspects of' civic
organisation might be passed, the apex of the
pyramid of joint effort might get up among
the stars; but if the foundations are unsound
the whole structure is wrong. A country
filled with idleness and unwilling to put out
its whole effort for its own defence might
call itself a republic or a socialism or by any
other title it pleased; but it would be in
reality a mere anarchy denying the fund',
mental reasons for its own existence. d "

CHINA IN REVOLUTION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sun Yat-sen, President of half a Republic
and generalissimo of the Provisional Govern-
ment, is the Kerensky of Asia. His romantic
career parallels that of the Russian in many
particulars. Their psychology is not unlike
Oriental quietism and Western radicalism
battle for mastery, and the result is com-
promise. Herbert Spencer’s “Life i s
Activity” and Laotsze’s “Occupy yourself
with doing nothing” meet in the same breasts
and explain why the two men appear to fail
just when success lies within their grasn
Pieter Elberfeld, who dreamed of Javanese
emancipation, sought his goal by means of
the knife; Rizal, who died for Filipino
liberties, appealed to pure Reason. Sun
Yat-sen alternately uses one weapon and
the other.
In 1896 London was startled to learn
through the indiscreet gossiping of a servant’
that a Chinese had been kidnapped in its
streets in broad daylight, and was being held
a prisoner in the Chinese Embassy until he
could be smuggled away on the plea of
lunacy to China, where the long arm of
Manchu power was waiting to fold him to
its spiked and secret bosom. This method of
political expediency, a commonplace in Asia,
was too much for London, and the Embassy
was compelled to deliver up its prey. That
was the first the world heard of Sun Yat-
sen. Yet he had for long been a thorn in
the side of Chinese officialdom. Born in
1867 near Canton, he had imbibed a know-
ledge of medicine and revolutionary ethics in
the English schools of Hongkong. Later, he
practised surgery in Macao, performing
operations, it is said, with remarkable skill.
But the diseased condition of the Chinese
body politic attracted his knife with irresisti-
ble appeal. He threw up his practice, and.
dressed as a pedlar, carried a new and
strange gospel of political heaven on earth
through the length and breadth of China. He
was a well-intentioned revolutionary, and his
aim was always to appeal to reason rather
than to force, to leaven the inert mass of
superstition that lay on the spirit of his
countrymen and to create a class of enlight-
ened and educated patriots who would in the
fulness of time promote a bloodless revolu-
tion. But events moved too quickly for him.
His motley gang of followers, time-servers
and adventurers were as alien to his ideals
as the Manchu enemy; and soon he found
himself involved in an ill-advised attempt to
seize Canton. It failed, and he fled the
country. His career from thence until the
Revolution of 1912 sounds like a romance by
Stanley YVeyman done into Chinese. In
broad daylight in the streets of European
cities he was not safe from Manchu ven-
geance. He was poisoned in Hawaii and
bombs were thrown at him in San Francisco.
But the seeds that had been sown in China
were already fructifying, while he was active
in obtaining the support of the wealthy
Chinese communities abroad. How much he
had to do with the actual engineering of the
Revolution it is hard to say; it came, like
the Russian Revolution, in a night. The
silken, befigured splendor of Manchu power
crumbled like an effigy of straw, and an
urgent telegram called Sun Yat-sen from
London to take the leadership of the new
Government at Nanking. But now the fatal
duality of Sun’s character reappeared.
Quietism. the logic of pure Reason,
triumphed, and with success in his grasp
he temporised, abdicated suddenly in favor
of Yuan Shih-k’ai, and thenceforward
again became the fugitive, with a republican
instead of an imperial price upon his head.
One of the most exquisite bits of satire in
history is that of the Chinese Empress Dow-
ager, wherein she suggests, in a final edict
before her abdication, that from her retire-
ment she will “watch with satisfaction the
glorious establishment and the consumma-
tion of a perfect government.” Sun's history
after the Revolution is the stormy history
of the Kuomintang, the “people's party,
which with pathetic faith believed that it
could replace the ancient theocratic rule ot
the Son of Heaven by a party government
founded on the" Parliamentary systems ot
Switzerland, America and England. At the
end of a year it had not settled the rules ot
its own procedure, much less produced a
single governmental act. It was dissolved b.v
Yuan according to the precedent set by
Cromwell, and 400 members of the Kuo-
mintang fled to the comparative security ot
the foreign settlements and to Japan, fol-
lowed by the knives and pistols of hundred
of government agents. The present writer
remembers that eruption of long-haired,
wild-eyed parliamentarians which filled tne
hotels of Shanghai and added to the pwtu-
resqueness of that Asiatic Geneva by making
assassinations, bomb outrages, kidnapping
and rumors of war our daily pabulum. Dr.
Sun was the genius of the play. His organ,
the Chinese Republican, waxed so hot
to be a danger even to the asbestos-line
neutrality of the Foreign Settlement, and 1
was suppressed. His old familiars, sna
Japanese adventurers, ex-generals a
admirals, journalistic freelances and t
agents of European munition-makers beg
to gather round him. Funds were obtai
by the simple expedient of running resp
able Chinese citizens, out for a walk in
evening, over the borders of the settlem
into the native city, where a ransom con
extracted by the application of a little
ture. Again, force was resorted to. A
house coolie was recruited in the ca , ip( j
liberty and equality, and went out a J? , j.
for $4 cash. There was a good deal of .
shed, a satisfactory expenditure of am
tion, and, in due course, when the game
up, the rebel generals, having trans ,
large banking accounts to Tokio. dP> ,
for Japan, while Sun Yat-sen disappear?
in the same direction. • t 0
In Japan Sun seems to have S ot ' j
the hands of a vicious cabal of intern
conspirators, and his name appears apt'
to an agreement between himself a


tain capitalists of the Land of the Rising
Sun to promote a fresh revolution. The
mysterious death of Yuan Siiih-k’ai brought
the Ivuomintang back a measure of power,
and the tragic farce of Parliamentary Gov-
ernment was resumed in Peking. The coun-
try, however, was fast learning its lesson.
The Son of Heaven, the chief patriarch of
China’s paternal system, had disappeared.
There was only an abstraction called a
Constitution reigning in Peking, and the
wrangling of a hundred political parties
was its chief manifestation. As in Russia,
individual liberty had become a catchword.
Provinces declared their independence and
made war upon one another. Cities, fus
and hsiens, even villages, threw off their
allegiance to the Central Government.
Bands of brigands marched to and fro,
their transport and commissariat being
supplied by trembling villagers. Generals
established a feudal system and their armies
sat astride strategic railways, levying tri-
bute on the countryside. Such is the coun-
try which Sun Yat-sen and his Kuomin-
tang followers aspired to guide into the
paths of constitutionalism. A military
autocracy saved the North, and the last
remnants of Young China fled with the
Navy to Canton. Here they have set up a
provisional Government on the approved
party lines, and Sun Yat-sen has re-
appeared to take its head. One of its first
acts, in imitation of the Peking Govern-
ment, has been a declaration of war on
Germany. But a storm is gathering in the
North, and before these lines are posted
another revolution may have taken place.
The most astonishing quality of China is
its unity. Knit loosely together, its parts
fly easily asunder. South bays at North;
all is chaos and dissension. But the tre-
mendous force contained in that State
principle, “All under Heaven are one
family,’’ draws the warring elements
together. A hundred years of foreign
aggression have left essential China invio-
late. She has absorbed all her conquerors.
Sun Yat-sen and the Revolution are like
a momentary breaking of the step in the
slow, enormous march of her destiny.
FENG-SHUI.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Are the Antis Relying on Volunteers or
Quitters?
Frank Tudor and Arthur Rae and
Bananaland’s Ryan and Mannix and the
Worker and Vida Goldstein have been for
a fortnight copiously perspiring in a
struggle with words and arithmetic, but up to
the present have not explained themselves.
This paper therefore suggests that as only
three weeks have to pass before the poll is
taken, the time is ripe to get down to bed-
rock. A convenient way of doing this would
be to knock off talking about Prussians and
Hughes and peace and Sinn Fein and
answer a couple of simple questions. These
are:—
1. Where are reinforcements for the army to come
from ?
2. If they do not come at all, what is to happen
next?
It looks, to say the least of it, dishonest to
imply one moment that voluntary effort will
fill the blanks, and then to wave a collection
of dubiods figures to prove that there are
no blanks that want filling. And there
seems to be a lack of candor about issuing
one day a pronunciamento expressive of
intense desire to see the allied arms victori-
ous, and shortly afterwards giving notice
that the best thing to do is to have a peace
conference with an unbeaten disturber of
the peace. Those people who vote “Yes”
on December 20 will know that there is
nothing in the Federal Government’s pro-
posals to interfere with voluntaryism, but
that, if voluntaryism fails, then the hole will
be repaired. The affirmative vote therefore
answers the question which Tudor and the
others have so far overlooked in reference to
where the men are to come from. The per-
son who votes “No” will, on the other hand,
do so either because he believes that volun-
tary effort is adequate to produce reinforce-
ments, or because he believes that it will
not produce reinforcements. Under such cir-
cumstances as this it would only be decent if
Tudor could manage to announce whether,
if he does not associate himself with the
cart-backing section, he has any alternative
to compulsion in case the volunteers are in-
adequate. And the direct advocates of turn-
ing-tail would look considerably more honest
if they explained whether they want to
surreptitiously identify themselves with the
other individuals who are declaring that the
voluntary system will produce the volun-
teers. Leaving matters as they are will
most certainly lead to confusion in the in-
terpretation of the “No” vote. For this
reason The Bulletin puts it to the
opponents of compulsion that they should,
in the interests of fair dinkum, get busy
repudiating one another during the week, or
they will, whatever the result of the vote
may be, have quite a lot on hand to repudi-
ate subsequently.

Booty.
The character of German kultur is often
as clearly written in the Teuton’s language
as in his mode of eating soup. When the
tribes beyond the Rhine first got a chance
to break from their savage forests, because
Rome, after cultivating the warlike spirit
out of their natural foes, withdrew her pro-
tective legions, they had no word for victory.
It had been a thing as scarce as they are
now finding it along the Western Front.
But when they burst into Gaul they cap-
tured a Celtic word to serve their purpose.
That word appears to-day in German as
“beute” and in English as “booty”—both
standing for war-plunder. The obvious in-
ference is that to the German, as well as
to the Teutonic Saxons who conquered
Britain, victory meant merely plunder;
while to the higher Celtic races victory had
a moral value and meaning not necessarily
connected at all with collaring the goods
of the man whose throat you had cut. Even
to-day the Teutonic element in the British
race makes it difficult to see a triumph of
arms without spoils as a reward ; but nations
like France, in which the feeling of the Celt
is dominant, can imagine a clean-out win
without so much as a crinkled hairpin
stolen from the vanquished. Germany is,
however, the country which elevates plunder
to an ideal. Not even the failure of the
submarine and the increasing cracks in the
Hindenbukg line can make the Prussian
forget his dreams of loot. To him victory
is still a material thing of lands and goods;
and the roaring of his cannon for world
conquest is merely another form of the
big brigandage which is the keynote of
kultur.

Struggling on the Verge.
With a population of 300,000, a State debt
of £40,000,000 plus a partnership share of
about £20,000,000 in the Commonwealth debt,
and afflicted with the headache supervening
on a prolonged spree with Scaddan, West-
ralia is meeting the dreadful realities by
overhauling the premises for stray thrums.
Treasurer Gardiner made a statement last
week of what the search had revealed so
far, and it reads like an old-time In Memor-
iam notice. He reckoned his revenue was
going to be £75,000 short of what it was last
year, but he was able to announce a decrease
of expenditure amounting to £104,844. As
this decrease would be achieved by suspend-
ing payment of sinking funds aggregating
£186,185, the fact is that the alleged decrease
in expenditure is to be accomplished by
spending £81,339 more. All of which con-
forms with the highest standards of latter-
day public finance in Australia. The net
result is the prospect of a deficit of £564,924.
This money has, of course, to be got from
somewhere, and one part of the proposed
footpaddery is to oblige all fire insur-
ance cos. doing business in the State
to deposit £5OOO apiece with the Treasury,
not for the protection of premium-
payers, but by way of loan at 4£
per cent. This will give about £150,000 to
play with for “the development of primary
and secondary industries,” a proceeding
which will mean, to begin with, an increase
in taxation. The annual charge on this
£150,000 will be £6750, and the practical
consequence thereof will be that, by taking
this additional sum from the local citizens’
earnings, the State will be able to go on
maintaining its ridiculous Cocked Hat, its
superfluity of Houses of Parliament and its
collection of officialdom in unimpaired dig-
nity. The annual cost of Westralia’s Cocked
Hat is £6500, of the Ministry £BO3O, of its
Parliaments, Select Committees and Royal
Commissions £40,000, the aggregate bill for
the outfit being £66,299. Treasurer Gardi-
ner announces that the principal thing to
consider just now is whether the outlay on
gaols, lunatic asylums, public health, educa-
tion and State children should be reduced.
The Bulletin suggests that the clamant
issue is whether this monstrous outlay on an
incompetent, wasteful Parliament and a
decorative stranger employed to open poultry
shows should be continued for even a day at
its present standard. The existence of insti-
tutions which are only maintained by raising
forced loans and telling numerous creditors
to renew the p.n. should come first under
review, and to adjourn the job is to perpe-
trate a fraud upon every youngster in the
country.
«
Universal Peace and Mrs. Gamp.
At a pacifist meeting in Sydney the other
day one of the women speakers announced
that “the time would come when the women
of the world would have to decide whether
they shall bear sons to be slaughtered.”
This does not seem to have very much to
do with the business of interrupting the
progress of individuals who are yearning to
slaughter the sons already produced. But
it opens up a vista to the imagination. It
is simply no good rejecting as fantastic the
idea of an international congress of women
met to consider this question. It is quite
possible, and just as probable as many other
things which only just before had been pro-
nounced inconceivable. Whether the Syd-
ney meeting which burst into wild applause
when the strike against son-production was
mentioned recognised that great encourage-
ment might thereby be given to the employ-
ment of women as hodcarriers and coal-
lumpers was not explained. Nor did any-
one make it clear what should be done in
the meantime when it is a case either of
slaughtering the other party or of getting
treated that way yourself. Yet that is at least
worth thinking over. Indeed, The
Bulletin urges the pacifist matrons to
vote a thunderous “Yes” as the only pos-
sible means by which they will get a fair
run for their notions and escape being
ordered to hand over a son per annum for
the further glory of Prussia.

The Brisbane Tramways.
Brisbane is in a difficulty, and the Govern-
ment proposes to lift it out by means which
call for more serious consideration than
seems to have been given them. For many
years the city had wretched horse-trams, of
which it was almost as much ashamed as of
its sewerage system. It badly wanted some-
thing better, but neither State nor munici-
pal authority was in a position to provide it.
Outside capital, however, saw that, though
there was not much prospect of an early
return, good profits might be made later on.
Public authority agreed to take the risk,
satisfied with a provision for acquiring the
whole undertaking, without paying anything
for goodwill, in 1920, and, if not then
acquired, at specified dates subsequently.
There was no howl about it. The Bulletin
warned Queensland that syndicate-owned
public utilities almost always squeezed the
public in the end ; but Brisbane was content
to risk being squeezed at some distant date
in return for an immediate convenience. It
got the immediate convenience, and now
doesn’t like the squeezing; wherefore two
bills have been introduced to the Assembly,
one providing for the rearrangement of sec-
tions, the fixing of fares and a limitation of
profit apparently to 5 per cent.; the other
for the purchase of the tramways on certain
terms. That some of the charges on the
Brisbane trams were excessive, especially
prior to the recent advance in running and
maintenance costs, scarcely admits of argu-
ment. But the blame for that lies not so
much with the company as with those who
gave the company the right to make those
charges. The Government would be more
than justified in negotiating with the com-
pany to relieve the public of the hardship
which it suffers in this respect. But if a
contract was made between the State and
the company, then the last thing in the
world that the State can afford to do is to
repudiate it. Morally it makes no differ-
ence what the State proposes to put in place
of that contract. But in practice it makes a
great deal of difference if what it proposes is
something so less favorable that the co.
would never have invested its money had
those conditions and limitations been there
in the beginning. And certainly no co.
would have looked at the proposition if
there bad been a provision that, no matter
how much lost interest there might be during
the construction period, and no matter what
losses on working there might be in the
early years of the service, profits might be
limited to 5 per cent, in the later years of
the concession. The one thing apart from
negotiation which the Government seems
morally entitled to do is to clear away any
doubts that may have been suggested as to
the right of the community to acquire the
undertaking without any payment for good-
will. No such doubts existed until recently,
and there is no question that, when the con-
cession was granted and Brisbane applauded
the start of construction, the public believed
that it had the right of purchase by paying
fair value for the plant, permanent way and
premises necessary for carrying on the busi-
ness. If there is a shadow of doubt now on
that point the clear intention of the State
ought to be reaffirmed. If the company offers
any objection to that, there will be evidence
that it wants something besides that square
deal upon which it is now insisting, and upon
which it has every right to insist. At pre-
sent it certainly looks as if it was inclined
to offer an objection. In a memorandum
addressed to all Queensland M’s.P. General-
manager Badger says:—
The valuation of a public utility is a very intricate
matter. Among the items which in all fairness
should be taken into consideration are development
expenses; reasonable promotion profit, including
compensation for risk of capital; expenses incurred
in raising capital; interest during construction
period; expenses incurred in building up the operat-
ing organisation; going value, which is quite dis-
tinct from goodwill, and other items too numerous
to mention.
Had the company been limited to a 6 per
cent. or> 7 per cent, dividend throughout the
life of the concession there might be some-
thing in all this. But in the absence of that
limitation there is not one of these items
that csin fairly be taken into account. The co.
is and has been for some years past paying
a dividend far beyond the average earnings
on an investment, and the excess is in return
for those very things which Badger enumer-
ates. If the community is required to pay
for them in a lump, then it will pay for them
twice over; and that ought to be resisted to
the utmost.
A letter from a Tasmanian mother to a
school-teacher who had asked why little
Billy wasn’t in his class: —
My husband and two sons have been accepted
for service abroad. One is now on his way to
England, and my husband and the other son are
in camp getting ready to go. As I feel the parting
very hard, as they have all gone in a month; I
feel so lonely without the eldest. All that are able
to go from my home are gone. The eldest at home is
14 years in a few days. I did not want dada to
go yet, as he is 45, and my boys who have gone are
both under 20; but they have heard the duty call,
and home ties must not hold them back. I am left
with seven young children, the youngest nine
months old, to battle along, and not strong myself;
yet I would not dare call them back. Duty’s call
must come first. In homes like ours is where the
real meaning of this terrible war is felt.
That’s what your voluntary system does!
It is haphazard, wasteful, unscientific and
uncertain. It is true that, under the Federal
Government's present scheme, voluntary
recruiting is still to be continued. But note
the difference. This man, like many another
earnest man with a large family, has gone
because the needed reinforcements were not
coming forward. Under the Government
scheme the man who knows how heavy his
family responsibilities are will also know
that the reinforcements will be provided—
that if those who should go don’t go volun-
tarily, at any rate the shame will not be
upon Australia of leaving Billjim in the
lurch.

After 3J years of war-lessons, in the course
of which several millions of tonnage have
gone under, the British Board of Trade has
made up its mind that at least four members
of the crew of every British ship over
2500 tons must be certificated look-outs.
For anything under that tonnage the crew
may, apparently, be as blind as cabbages
and monarchies. It is an amazing fact that,
although keen eyesight is so essential in the
seafaring profession, there is no obligation
on the sailorman to undergo tests for color
or form vision. He may voluntarily present
himself for examination, but should he fail
to obtain a certificate there has been nothing
to stop him returning to any ship as a full-
blown look-out! Even shipmasters are
exempt from any regulation, except in some
of the big lines which take their own pre-
cautions ; and it is but lately that pilots
have been tested, and that only because
somebody suffering from myopia aggravated
by senile decay ran a passenger boat full-
tilt into Point Nepean, outside Melbourne.

At the time of writing it looks as if Jerusa-

with a gondola in Venice. Australian
Light Horsemen days ago occupied the spot
where St. Peter got his instructive vision
let down in a sheet from Heaven, and
British troops have pushed the Turks out
over the very hills where David sang to his
sheep. Bethlehem, Bethany and Bethel are
all within the sweep of the new advance;
and any day now the City of the Great King-
may be completely invested. The capture
of Jerusalem might be a comparatively
small thing from a strategical point of view;
but sentimentally—and the psychological
value of sentiment is great in war the
event would be one of tremendous import-
ance. Jew, Mohammedan and Christian all
regard the city as sacred ; and the inability
of Turkey to ‘hold it even with German aid
would be proof of weakness in countless mil-
lion eyes. Venice may fall; and that
would be a fearful Italian calamity. But
the taking of Jerusalem might far more
than counterbalance even that. According to
many very devout and cocksure students of
prophecy, Armageddon is to be fought out
in the valley just north of ancient
Samaria; and Jerusalem lies far back on
the road to that interesting spot. It seems
almost up to the Turk to make a grand
stand for evil in the true prophetic spirit
at the right place. It would encourage the
ardent student, besides making the person
in baggy trousers feel that he had thoroughly
done his duty in being properly licked just
where he ought to be.
“J.P.H.”: Shell-shock and other mental
and nerve cases among returned soldiers
constitute one of the large problems ahead
of us; and thus far the Defence Department
has given it the most niggardly attention.
This is quite characteristic. It is, indeed,
neglect to thoroughly examine the recruit
in the first place that produces subsequently
so large a crop of mental and nerve cases.
Few develop these troubles rapidly ; usually
they are the result of long-standing dis-
eases, very often hereditary. Army medical
men have no proper way of examining the
nerves, and if a man is found otherwise fit
he is passed. In cases where neurasthenia
is very apparent in the form of severe
trembling or when blood-pressure is high,
the recruit is passed out; but in many
serious cases bodily trembling is scarcely
apparent even to the patient himself. Thus
the neurotic is often sent off to train. The
lucky ones break down before they get to
the Front and the nerve-strains that may
shatter their health for ever. I understand
Senator Pearce has stated that 60,000 men
have been discharged from Australian camps
as unfit to be sent to the Front. It would
be interesting to ascertain the causes for
their discharge. That would give medical
officers a “line” for future examinations.
“Cleveland”: “M.G.” (B. 28/6/T7) writes
to the point on the subject of defective re-
cruits, but does not indicate what a colcnsal
expense the perfunctory examination of men
in Australia is running us into. In the
reinforcements I crossed with, and which
consisted of 150 men, 14 were weeded out
at the first medical exam, on the score of
age alone. Evidently it has been found that,
however a middle-aged man may feel, he is
not able to stand the training, or, later on,
the real thing. So, if a man says he is
44 11-12ths and looks 50, he is not regarded
as being worth while preparing for battle.
In addition to the over-aged 14, there were
four “shrewdies” who suddenly remembered
old weaknesses, “crook” knees being a
speciality. The trouble is that such shirkers
can return to Australia and swank round
with the colors up just as if they had been
“over the top” in France with the best of
them. I was informed, on good authority,
that 700 men who had never seen the firing-
line were sent back to Australia in one recent
month. As it costs £lOO to land a man
here, that means £70,000 thrown overboard
in one splash.
Those who vote “No” thinking that they
thereby vote for voluntaryism must have
been wandering about with their eyes closed.
Especially during the last 12 months a vast
proportion of those who have gone into camp
have been youngsters who have done it, not
because they had thrashed the matter out
in their own minds, but because they
dreaded the jeers of their mates of both
sexes. The sensitive youngster has been
driven with wdiips more stinging than any
Parliament Could ever plait. There was
something like a general strike the other
day, and. as everybody knows, thousands of
men who were utterly opposed to the stop-
page threw up their jobs. That sort of thing
always happens: there is a compelling force
behind these men far too strong for them
to resist. It is the same with thousands
of lads and even older men with regard to
enlistment. You can’t at this stage of the
tragedy get voluntaryism all round by vot-
ing against compulsion. You get only a
pretence of it—you only get voluntaryism
in spots. And every unionist who has gone
out on a strike of which he did not person-
ally approve knows it.

Senator Pearce would be doing good work
if he could arrange to have the Australians
who have been taken prisoners bv the Turks
exchanged. Food is not particularly plenti-
ful with Abdul, and, not accustomed to
worry much about, the tucker his own sol-
diers get, he cannot be expected to rise to
great heights in looking after those whom
Allah has placed" in his hands. All the
same, Billjim generally reports well of
him as a fighting man. and he would per-
haps consider reasonably a proposal for
exchange. Some mothers and fathers in
Australia would hear with great joy of a
move being made in the direction, anyhow.
If Russia should break into fragments, the
largest will be the Ukraine, covering a
population of 30,000,000 and stretching
from near Lemberg to the Sea of Azov.
Moreover, it will be largely unsympathetic
with the rest of the fractions, since it differs
from them all in political ideals, and is
further separated by a language that is only
dimly related to all the other Aryan-Slavic
tongues. Apart from that, the Ruthenian
is animated by an implacable Sinn Feinism
that grew fat on persecution and revealed
its strength when the ex-Czar went to war.
From the outset the readiest to surrender to
the Huns were Ruthenian peasants from the
south of Russia, while the Czar’s bitterest
foes were the small Ruthenian detachments
raised by Austria in Galicia. Until recently
these people carried on in Geneva a violent
propaganda against Russia. They issued a
magazine called the Ruthenian Review,

sent opportunity to realise its old dreams and
break away, it is individualist and
romantic enough to prefer the swank
of a monarchy to the drab useful-
ness of a republic. About the beginning of
the 18th century there was a proposal to
set it up as a separate kingdom, and it is on
historical record that the throne was offered
to England’s great soldier, Marlborough. If
it still has a gold hat to spare, why not

An Unexpected Call and a Played-out
Bear.
Apparently Von llindenburg was so satis-
fied with the strength of the masonry he had
skipped back to after the battle of the Somme
that the last thing lie thought of was that
anyone would drop in there without giving
notice. And Von llindenburg had good
reason to feel that way; for, after all, there
had been very little imagination in the strategy
of the Allies in this war, and the formula of
attack had become almost stereotyped. But
things happened to produce a change. In
all probability British Headquarters learned
that consequent on the proceedings in the
vicinity of Ypres and on the Italian frontier
the German had skinned his line east and
south of Arras, where for a long time there
had been nothing doing. The problem then was
whether an intended assault should be pro-
claimed by a bombardment or w r hether this
item of the programme should be cut out
and a surprise party arranged. The latter
being chosen, Fritz’s protecting belts of wire
were demolished at dawn by a fleet of tanks;
cavalry, infantry and guns were then rushed
into the breach and a nasty hole torn in
an elaborate system of fortifications. It was
a remarkably fine piece of work; out though
it is not yet clear what the effect of the
operations may be, the character of the
German defences and the rapidity with
which the enemy gathered himself together
to resist the inflowing tide suggest that the
visitors would have had a horrible reception
if the other side had got word of the pending
call. The thrust carries the British troops
to within two or three miles of Cambi’ai, one
of the most important railway junctions
behind the enemy lines, but just now
a particularly unpleasant place of resi-
dence. Yet gratifying though the success
has been to hear about, the ringing
of “joybells'’ in Sydney the other day
and the perambulating of bands and all the
other evidence of a modified Maffick made
an outburst which might well have been
postponed. We need to get and keep things
in right perspective, and we never will do
that while we humbug ourselves and one
another. The advance by General Byng’s
army is. in truth, a mere detail of incom-
parably less significance than the uniformly
calamitous happenings in Russia. And
there is the further consideration that the
fate of Northern Italy is far from being cer-
tain. Russia is going rapidly from bad to
worse. The news that the Russian ambas-
sador at Washington is throwing up his job
and that the Embassies of the Allied Powers
are leaving for their homes, added to the
tales about offers of a truce to Germany, are
ominous of events that may shake the Allies
to their boots. A Russia at Germany’s
mercy and the enemy armies on the
Western Front strengthened by the forces
drawn away from the neighborhood of the
Bear are less pleasant to think about than
the Christmas holidays. But these things
have to be thought about, all the same, and
the easiest way to do it is to start by disre-
garding all forms of blither. The Allies
are not winning the war. They have not
commenced to win it. And the meaning of
that to Australians, in spite of flaring head-
lines in the newspapers and joybells and
bands, is that their country is in the direst
peril.

The Bulletin respectfully puts it to P. M.
Glynn, Minister for Home Affairs, that he
should within the next day or two explain
what precautions are being taken to keep the
Immigration Act from acquiring serious
damage at a very important place. That Act
prohibits the entrance of any person suffer-
ing from a serious transmissible disease.
Soldiers, of course, have to be admitted. But
soldiers are not the only people arriving in
Australia just now. and what this paper
w~nts *-<•> know is whether, in the event of a
vessel discharging a large number of passen-
gers nom oversea, Glynn is taking any
measures to protect Australia against addi-
tional supplies of horror. If he isn’t he
might explain why. And if he asserts that
there is no cause for alarm, he might oblige
by detailing his reasons for that com-
placency. Meanwhile suspicion that parts of
the Act have been devoured by ants is fairly
common; and they won’t be any less common
if Glynn says nothing and does less.
From Canon Dickinson (Melb.) :
In a paragraph of November 22 ydu imply that, as
a canon of St. James’s Old Cathedral, I ought to
have prevented, or at least protested against, any
of the buildings erected on its grounds being used
“for beer-stores or whisky-finance” (I quote your
words), and that, not having done this, my protest
against the Government of Victoria drawing revenue
from licenses to sell intoxicating liquor must be
ineffectual. I am sure that you will allow me to
explain that canons of the Old Cathedral had no
right to interfere in any way with the property:
this belonged to the trustees of St. James’s. The
leases did not come, in any way, under our cogni-
sance. In fact, we were appointed by Bishop Perry
in recognition of work done for the diocese and
with no definite functions. As to amendment of
the State liquor laws, I have always, consistently,
and with all my little influence, under Bishops Perry
and Moorhouse, and to this day, advocated that.
As a trustee of St. Luke’s, South Melbourne, and
with the hearty concurrence of my co-trustees, a
clause was inserted in every lease granted prohibiting
any sale of intoxicating liquor on the premises. I
fervently hope and pray that this newlv-elected Par-
liament will place the decision of this vital question
in the hands of the people by local option.
The two foremost political persons-of-the-
hour in Vic. now that the elections are over
are both pilgrims on the Inky Way. John
Bowser, the new Premier, is part-proprietor
and editor of the Wangaratta Chronicle.
He is about 60, and among country press-
men is reckoned “white” through and
through. A Scotchman, he graduated in ink
at Edinburgh, and takes both his press work
and his politics verra seriously. He figured
in a libel action once in which he likened
the reptile round the corner to an aged and
cunning old horse with an appetite for beans.
The old horse aforesaid bit John's paper for
a few hundreds before a judge and jury:
since when the lion, member for Wangaratta
and Rutherglen has been very cautious in
his comments, especially regarding aged
horses. The other pilgrim is .J. J. Hall, who
left his billet with the Bendigo Advertiser
to take on the secretaryship of the Farmers’
Union. Besides whipping up cocky votes,, he
edits the weekly print run in the Union’s
interests and just at present is also fighting a
protest against his return for Kara Kara.
Hall is proving a versatile person, and if he
keeps the old size in hats promises to go
far in Vic. politics.
“8.A.” raises a point for the defence: —
John Storey, N.S.W. Labor leader, denounces Con-
scription, though “nothing would give him greater
delight than to see the big loafing squatter sent
to the Front.” On this The Bulletin remarks that
the referendum gives John a chance to have his way.
It doesn’t, because Hughes in his Bendigo speech
said that woolgrowers and rural workers would be
exempt.
But John Storey’s objection was not to men
who grow r w’ool. It w r as to loafers, and
The Bulletin can find no record of
Hughes or anyone else having promised to
exempt men w’ho shirk both work and mili-
tary service. Exemption of rural workers,
shipbuilders and so on does not apply to
people who are not rural workers or who
do not build ships. The only way of getting
at these people is to use compulsion. If
“8.A.” knows of any other way by which a
loafer can be prevented from sheltering
behind voluntaryism he ought to produce it.
The Law in S. Aus. has had its beard
pulled by Villeneuve Smith, who was de-
fending a man charged with making a cash
book on the City racecourse. Others up on
the same charge had pleaded guilty, merely
alleging the foolishness of betting being
allowed on one side of the fence (the side
where the totalisator is) and not on the
other; to which the S.M. replied that such
is the law, and that cricket is lawful on the
Oval but not in King William-street. When
the turn of V. Smith’s client came, he
pleaded boldly that there was no offence, as
he was charged under the Act of 1907. which
had been repealed by a consolidating Act
this session. There was a hasty adjourn-
ment to find out whether the new Act had
yet been assented to, and, as it apparently
had been, the one of 1907 is dead. So not
only did this defendant go free, but the two
others just previously fined were recalled
and told they were technically Not Guilty.
Monday next, December 3. will be the
63rd anniversary of Eureka Stockade.
Owen C. T\ illiams. who died at Colombo
lately, aged 70, was born in Tasmania and
joined the London Chartered Bank (Melb.)
in 1864. Ten years later he transferred to
the Bank of Australasia, and after manag-
ing in divers places wound up as manager
of the chief Sydney branch. He played
inter-State cricket for Vic. years ago. and
was also a noted cyclist and tennis-player.
A son (Capt. O. B. Williams) is with the
Australian Engineers in France.
Crawford Vaughan, lately Premier of S.
Aus.. and now in America on a speech-
making mission, “may retire from political
life on his return,” suggested the Register
the other day. “It is understood that after
his campaign in America he will proceed to
London, where an important position may
be offered to him.” But Mrs. Vaughan
promptly wrote to contradict this, assuring
the public that he has no intention of giving
up S. Aus. Before marriage she was a
Goode, whose brother —unmarried —was
Vaughan's Minister for Lands. An older
married brother has just been returned after
being wounded.
Mrs. Helen Barton, of the W.C.T.U., has
sized up the Melbourne male, and finds him
an unthrifty wretch. The W.C. is strong on
women’s thrift-meetings, but Mrs. Barton’s
idea is that the gatherings would be better
attended by men, who need instruction in
how to look after their money. Tobacco is
Mrs. Barton’s special aversion. Its use in-
volves “a most prodigious waste,” and the
money spent on smokes “could be used to
better advantage in the War Loan.” Man’s
use of tobacco seems to be in the same ex-
pensive class as woman’s—well, let Mrs.
Barton count up the things she has that she
might do without, from ribbons round her
hat t 0... .The Bulletin declines to pursue
the matter any further.
The Vic. State election has eased things a
little for the worried reporter. In the last
Leg. Assembly there were 10 members with
only five names between them, and the press-
men got hold of the wrong bird occasionally.
The two Billsons, J.W. and A.A., have
both come back, and so have James Cam-
eron and A.F. But Dave Smith is the
only one of his family in the House now that
W.lv. has been knocked out by Slater in
Dundas. The defeat of ex-R„ilway Minis-
ter Hugh McKenzie for Echuca has left
M. K. McKenzie alone to represent the
clan. As for the two Grays, John and
Achilles, they have both gone.
“O. Blin”: The story about Uncle Sam
paralysing the Huns with a flock of 100.000
’planes in the early New Year seems ridic-
ulous beside an official admission that Uncle
will be happy if he has 20,000 in commission
by next midsummer. But that number over-
rates Uncle’s potentiality, for he will follow
the wise British and French system of keep-
ing two and even three machines in reserve
for every one aloft. This means that his
striking force for a while will be a maximum
of 5000, which will be kept very busy spot-
ting for the Yankee artillery and performing
other familiar duties without indulging in
those week-ends at Essen which the kerb-
stone strategist appears to expect. As the
average life of a ’plane is about three months
the maintenance of the fleet involves an
annual programme of 20,000 apart from the
continuous supply of personnel, the first
drafts of which have just started training.
The U.S. voted over $6<M >.000.000 for its
aeroplane service, and a like sum is threat-
ened at an early date; but those are only
measures of preparation which will not bear
fruit for several months yet. Still, the best
that the Yankee means trouble is
Fritz’s redoubled activity in the construction
of ’planes. He has even turned the Zeppelin
works at Friedrichshafen into a big “’bus”-
factory. and is generally speeding-up by every
means in his power. (P.S. —By an oversight
he omitted to have a referendum on the sub-
ject.)
“T. 0.1.”: The tailor had a hand in an
expulsion from the Vic. Assembly that was
not mentioned in a recent Bulletin. The
party on that occasion—it happened in
November. 1861—was Patrick Costello, of
North Melbourne. Pat got the kick-out for
taking part in a conspiracy at Mornington
when James McCulloch was returned. An
extensive wardrobe of second-hand clothing
was taken to Snapper Point, where a num-
ber of absentees and dead men were imper-
sonated. some men voting two and three
times with a change of clothing.
David Storey in 1911:
For the last 10 rears I hare been speaking against
the practice of having Honorary Ministers. I shall
certainly vote against the practice.
To-day a somewhat different Storey, though
wearing the same brand of hats, is Hon.
Minister in the Holman-Fuller Government.
The old story was that a man was made an
Hon. Minister “to placate him, to keep him
quiet. ’ The new story on that point has
not yet been told.
Two good handbooks on the horribly-involved sub-
ject of income taxes have lately been published.
Through Butterworth’s Dr. Waddell and F. L. Coffey
have issued “X.S.W. Income Tax Acts,” which in-
cludes not only the statutes and regulations and
forms in force, but examples illustrating the com-
putation of assessment and tables for the purpose,
these latter supplied by Commissioner Whiddon.
The other guide has been prepared by Federal Com-
missioner Ewing to explain the War Time Profits
Act, the subjects dealt with or arising out of the
law being arranged alphabetically. Both volumes
are well indexed.

A four-act drama by an Australian author
was the unusual fare provided by Adelaida
Repertory Theatre at its “last night of th!
year.” It is by Alec Melrose, a local lawyer
of literary tastes, but not hitherto (and he
is past his first youth) suspected of active
production. It is a hard, brilliant, machine
made comedy-drama on the lines of Pinero
or II. A. Jones, completely un-Australian in
setting and sentiment. The theme is one of
the most hackneyed—the intervention of one
male friend to save another from a supposed
adventuress. Greenhill is an English play-
wright, staying at Mentone to worn-
through a play which will not finish itself
and Eve, a charming widow, joins him there
by arrangement. Sellick, the woman-hater
intervenes on behalf of Mrs. Greenhill, who
also turns up to argue her own cause. The
scene between these two and Eve is delight-
ful, but marred by an unaccountable argu-
ment from each woman. Eve, appealed to
to go home before anything actually wrong
develops, replies that Greenhill has earned
her gratitude, and she can’t go. Why should
not the wife ask him to leave, she suggests ■
but the wife refuses to “humiliate” him in
that way. This doubtful psychology is per-
haps needed to lead up to the great scheme
by which Eve is to compromise herself with
someone else in order to choke off Green-
hill ; and the stiff Sellick has to consent to
play the part of compromiser. There is
genuine humor in a restaurant scene. They
have shed elaborate trails for Greenhill to
track them by, and instructed the amazed
landlord to show-in the gentleman who will
follow; and by a series of pleasant mis-
understandings he first shows-in all the
minor characters of the play instead. The
last act. of course, presents Eve as an
estimable person with whom Sellick can
fairly pair off for life.
There is the literary touch in this "Ad-
venture of an Adventuress.” It 1. soon made
clear that Greenhill is working out in his
own person the ending of the play for which
as author he could find no end. There is a
closing scene, after the other characters
hatve left, which may be something of an
anti-climax: but one would not have it
away. A shrewd manager recites the vari-
ous plans for working out an ending—rail-
way collision for melodrama, suicide for the
“The Rainbow,” at
Sydney Criterion.

of Homes.”
intense drama, and
so on; “and of
course if it's Rep-
ertory stuff you
end nowhere and
leave the audience
guessing.” "But if
it is real life?” the
unhappy playwright
asks. “Oh, then,
the man says, ‘I’ve
been a damn fool.
I’m going home to
my wife.’ ” And it
is precisely this
which Greenhill is
remarking to him-
self at curtain-fall.
The acting was
good from the ama-
t e u r standpoint,
but hardly up to
the standard the
Adelaide Rep. has
made for itself. Its

Beryl Cook was the worthy but angular wife

At the Haymarket Ivathlyn Williams flits
through “The Big Timber” all in snowy
white. The plot is hackneyed, but the film
holds the attention by an interesting display
of lumber operations. The Palace is consid-
ering the case of “Idle Wives.”

The impulsive Majah Bagnal is still gloat-
ing on the unexpected feast of girl and glad-
ness in his dinky little bedroom at Melbourne
Royal. Fortune had never previously fur-
nished such a dazzling menu, and the war-
rior naturally appreciates his luck by grab-
bing the titbit without saying grace.
Heaven knows how the affair would have
progressed had nottSammy Thornhill inter-
vened with a virtuous cough. Considering
that Sam ought to have been dumb with
amazement, his corf, under the circs., is a
miraculous performance. At any rate it
appeals to the lady as a tip from Providence
that she is in a tight place, and she retires
in good order just as her eyes are saying
“Kamerad!” and other nice things. To-
morrow she and hen “Pair of Silk Stock-
ings” come off altogether, and on Saturday a
new problem, “Mrs. Dot,” will take the stage.
Caesar is being butchered once more at
Melbourne King’s. G. Kay Souper again
figures as the distinguished corpse and poses
himself in death like a warrior and a gentle-
man. Also lan Maclaren is not less physi-
cally impressive than before, but his speech
in the Forum still lacks poison. One hardly
feels the incitement to vengeance behind his
periods. A. E. Greenaway continues to
make Cassius the cunning lagoist who fills
Brutus’s ear with subtle insurrection.
Greenaway’s performance remains the most
admirable'in the piece; it accentuates the
simplicitv of Brutus (George Bryant), who
is still afflicted with a voice too ponderous
for conspiracy. Bryant rather justifies
Antony’s sneer that he is an "honorable
man.” He suggests the virtue of a Roman
who is too dull to be wicked. The wifely
solicitude of Mrs. Brutus is repeated by
Miss Sutcliffe, but a new Calphurma
(Rosslyn Yavne) now utters her premoni-
tions to Imperial Caesar. Caesar will perish
in his purple until to-morrow, and on Satur-
day the heavy atmosphere of tragedy will be
dispersed by the pastoral gaiety of ‘ As Aou
Like It.”
Hall Caine’s narrative of “The Woman
Thou Gavest Me” is still touring the world
at Melbourne Princess’s. It gets sunburn
at Naples and rheumatism in Ireland, and
is partially boiled at Port Said on its way
to the Antarctic, where it is speedily frost-
bitten in several places. But in the frozen
South it has its most interesting develop-
ments, for here the hero learns that his be-
loved Lady Raa is gnawing her last maca-
roon in a garret in London. This
information is vouchsafed in a vision which
Heaven and ’AH Caine arrange on the back
curtain, and the sight is so affecting to the
lady’s adorer that he postpones his Polar
sprint and darts home to the rescue,
** * *
Connie Ediss and her freak husband,
Alfred Frith, continue to air their differ-
ences in “You’re in Love” at Melbourne
Majesty’s. Frith is a strange object to
take into holy partnership. When you look
at Connie you realise that marriage may
mean a lot. When you look at him you
realise that it means a lottery.
At Melbourne Tivoli Ada Reeve and Co.
are on the point of departure, and a new
crowd of artists will bound in on Saturday.
Ada departs with The Bulletin’s best
wishes for the recovery of a throat which
kept her out of sight for a couple of nights
last week and threatened to end her season
before she had finished it.
** * *
Ethel Clayton and Bessie Love are the
current heroines at Melbourne Britannia.
Ethel is making matrimony a priceless pro-
fession in “The World Beneath,” whilst
Bessie follows the old sport of baiting land-
lords in the Triangle drama, “Wee Lady
Betty.” Dustin Farnum is staggering
humanity at the Melba with fist and fortune
in a novel disturbance called “Playing Fair.”
To-day also Nat Gould's old story, “The
Chance of a Lifetime,” takes the screen for a
gallop.
Hoyt’s reliable enchantress, Olga Petrova,
has arrived in Melbourne in a new tragedy,
“To the Death,” which has a Corsican set-
ting and is very Corsican in plot and feeling.
Olga is the passionate avenger of her sister’s
ruin, and with Woman’s customary inaccu-
racy plants her dagger in the wrong man.
As the victim is her best boy the lady has
to marry him to make amends for her error.
Jean Sothern is the biggest knot in the
other tangle, “Miss Deception.” The story
deals with a prairie female who becomes a
“hit” in Noo Yurk sassiety, and Miss Sothern
demonstrates how she does it.
Adelaide is supping with the ghosts of
dead plays. Wondergraph shows on the
film “Bella Donna,” in which Julius Knight
used to just prevent Irene Browne from
poisoning her husband, Martin Lewis. “The
Whip” at West’s proves how the Yankees
have broken two commandments, first an-

MAJESTY’S, MELBOURNE.

nexing the old Drury Lane play, and then
adulterating it. But fox-hunt and race-
course and railway smash, which could be
only faintly indicated on the stage, are the
reai things on the screen. At the Majestic
the Tom Haverley crowd are serving up the
aged “Muldoon’s Picnic” ; at the Tivoli “A
Girl’s Temptation” is liKe the ghost of all
the melodramas that ever were. Finally, at
the Itoyal, “The White Chrysanthemum”
recalls one serious opera by its title and at
least four comic ones by the capers of its
English newcomers in Asiatic surroundings.
The last night of the Chrysanthemum, with
a wealth of flowers and toy-presents for
all concerned, was the absolute last of the
play and of the Tait Co. in its present
form. The co. will now take in Bert Bailey
as a Dame and start to rehearse “Aladdin.”
AT POVERTY POINT.
Evelyn Beerbohm has been killed by shell
explosion in France. Sydney society gave
him pink teas and glad eyes when he first
came here some 10 years ago, and this sDoke
well for Sydney’s disinterestedness, for the
ex-Guardsman hadn’t a copper, lie appeared
here later in the Waller and Madge Titheradge
company. Beerbohm married a beautiful
Sydney girl named Anderson, daughter of a
prominent shipping man.
Jo Smith’s personal experience :
My name having crept into the Poverty Point dis-
cussion as to whether an Australian playwright can
get a hearing, it may be of interest for me to state
exactly how I have fared. I read my “Miner’s
Trust” to Meynell, Clarke and Gunn, and before I
left the theatre I had sold it to them at a big
figure. Anderson heard that I was writing “The
Bushwoman” and asked me to give him first chance.
I sold it to him four days after I had finished writ-
ing it. He asked for more, and I wrote “The Girl
of the Never Never,’’ and placed it at a satisfactory
price before the ink was quite dry. I submitted
“Before the Dawn” to Williamson’s, who read it at
once, but said it would not suit them. To Bailey
and Grant I mentioned the fact that I had written
the comedy, and they invited me to read it to them
the next day. They liked it, but thought it was
not their stuff —an opinion that I shared with them.
I did not submit “The Reveille” to anybody, as
I wanted to make a few hundred pounds for soldiers
out of the first performance. But I invited leading
managements to see the piece, and three out of the
four were present in person at the Auditorium on
August 8. They thought, as I do, that the strong
recruiting flavor of the play would be against it as
a commercial proposition. I mentioned to Fullers
that I was the owner of the acting rights Of “The
Miner’s Trust,” and within a few days had concluded
arrangements with them for production. It will
thus be seen that I have nothing to complain of as
regards the chance of getting a hearing; and as
far as public appreciation is concerned, I produced
“Before the Dawn” and “The Reveille” in the inter-
ests of Soldiers’ Funds with good amateurs, and by
25 performances raised £l5OO nett.
“Penden”: I hadn’t booked and there
wasn’t a decent unreserved seat to be seen
until I. pressed a bob into the palm of the
usher. Then he came to life and found a
bogus “reserve’.’ for me in the front stalls.
Seems to me that a shilling or so will whip
the card off every second seat in Melbourne.
Do the managers run the theatres for the
ushers now?
“E.T.’’: Australia’s old friend Teddy
Royee is still at work in England. He was
recently, at the age of 77, playing Gaspard,
the miser, in “Les Cloches de Corneville.”
Muriel Starr has got back from her native
America and, once more under J.C.W., Ltd.,
is to make her re-appearance in Melbourne
during the Christmas holidays as the hero-
ine of a Hawaiian romance called “The Bird
of Paradise.” George Barnum produces..
“Dick Sniveller”: Surprising where all
the comedians come from! In spite of the
high cost of laughter and the impossibility
of importing any new manufacturers Aus-
tralian managers are able to supply the
casts this year of three pantomimes—
“ Robinson Crusoe,” “Aladdin” and “Dick
Whittington.” I believe the shows will be
as funny as usual, too. But what about
the managers’ oft-repeated assertion that
local talent is at a discount in this class of
work —that the public must have “new
faces”? The Kaiser has done more for
Australian industries than he will ever
know, and the corpses of the old stinking-
fish party are strewed all over the land.
“The Immature”: One of the salient
features of “Mr. Manhattan” is the absence
of the capering chorus gent. Isn’t there
enough of him to go round, or has the inane
“business” driven him to the war?
Composer Alfred Hill, who, in conjunc-
tion with Arthur Adams, manufactured a
comic opera, “Tapu,” for J. C. Williamson
some years ago, and D. H. Soutex-, inventor
of the notorious cat and writer of some
bright Bulletin stories, have collaborated
in the production of a pantomime, which is
to be put on at the Little Theatre (Syd-
ney) at Christmas. Souter has designed
the scenery and dresses, a guarantee that
they will be both striking and picturesque,
and Hill has built some charming melodies
on a basis of old Indian folk-songs and
ceremonial marches.
“Buskin”: Horace Lingard’s successful
tour of Austi’alia in the ’seventies with “Our
Boys” (B. 22/11/T7) was not the only Aus-
tralian venture he made with the ancient
comedy. Some 30 years later he appeared
in Melbourne with Van Biene and “The
Broken Melody.” During the tour he parted
from the old man, and once more, in the
Spring of 1906, took a flier on his lone-
some w 7 ith Byron’s money-maker. He put
“Our Boys” on at the Bijou, then a sure
luck-bi-inger (bad luck always), with Lucy
Coppin and Hans Phillips as the best-known
of his assistants, and played for six nights
to a dozen people a night. Then the curtain
fell quietly, and Horace pushed off along the
track, carrying a slender swag and with
sewn in the lining of his vest. He was popu-
lar with the co., and everybody was sorry to
see him go, particularly as—well, everybody
was sorry to see him go.
The Alhambra revue, “The Bing Boys are
Here,” with which Oswald Stoll brought
back fortune to the old Leicester Square
establishment, is shortly to be put on at
Her Majesty’s, Sydney.
“Private Boxer” : Joan Meynell, daughter
of Clyde, of the J.C.W. firm, is in the cast
of “The Boy,” the new musical-comedy ver-
sion of Pinero’s “Magistrate” at London
Adelphi. The good-looking lady had vari-
ous small parts in several Clarke and Mey-
nell shows, and subsequently distinguished
herself by marrying the handsome “juven-
ile,” A. J. Patrick, then with Williamson
and now, as Jerome Patrick, an ornament of
the American stage.
When Ada Reeve’s throat forced her out
of Melbourne Tivoli programme, the man-
agement went racing about in search of
local talent to fill the gap and found it in
four Melba pupils : —Violet Concanen, Emily
Head, Vera O’Donnell and Jean Lewis.
They went on as the “Melba Quartet,” offer-
ing solos and concerted numbers, and very
successfully filled what might have been an
aching void.
Olive Godwin, after being absent from the
stage for two years, is returning for the
“Aladdin” pantomime, which Bailey-Grant
and the Taits are putting on at the King’s
for Christmas.
From the U.S.A.:—
Allen Doone, billed as “the Australian actor-
manager,” recently found some vacant dates at the
48th Street Theatre and put up “Lucky O’Shea,”
with Leonard Willey in the cast. Fred Niblo is
scoring in a new piece, “Love and Learn,” and
his brother-in-law, J. M. Cohan, is biographing him-
self in “Seven Keys to Baldpate.” Dad Cohan, by
the way, died the other day. His name was really
O’Cohan, and he was descended from O’Caomhan, a
onee-famous harper in the West of Ireland.
Katherine Kaelred, whom Australia knew as Elbert
Orton, was lately fastened to the leading part in
“Misalliance.” Hale Hamilton has been in a
N’York revival of “What Happened to Jones.” His
wife, Myrtle Tannehill, is in “Poor Butterflies,” a
new Smith and Golden production. Henry Kolker
is leading man in George Broadhurst's latest, “Over
the ’Phone.” Rapley Holmes, whom Charles Wal-
dron took to Australia, has been drawing a salary
from Willie Collier as a heavyweight sundry in
“Nothing but the Truth.” Another old “Squaw
Man” identity, Hardee Kirkland, is to support
George Arliss in a historical drama entitled
“Hamilton,” dealing with the life and times of
Unc. Sam’s first Sec. of the Treasury. Oscar
Asche’s “Chu Chin Chow,” at Manhattan Opera
House, has provided a gaudy billet for Tyrone
Power. 0. P. Heggie, still a Repertorian and a
realist, has made another artistic success in Gals-
worthy’s “Little Bit o’ Love” at San Francisco.
Margaret Anglin is in vaudeville. The Russian
Revolution was lately pictured and played by an
American co. Nance O’Neil had the part of the
ex-Czarina. Young Australian Ronald Byram, who
keeps the best of company, has done nice work in
“Cheating Cheaters,” which, I believe, J.C.W. has
bought for Australia, and a comic fantasy, “De
Luxe Annie,” will be one of the Tait offerings in
Australia next year. War hasn’t made any holes
in the profits yet; but McCormack, Caruso, Pad-
erewski, Kreisler and others have formed themselves
into a travelling concert party to cheer up young
Samuel in the training-carfips, which shows that
things are getting different.
“H.” : Oscar Asche and Lily Brayton have
established a record at His Majesty’s, Lon-
don, surpassing the best achievement of
Herbert Tree, with all his undoubted talents
and ability. They have made a play run
there for an entire year, with every pros-
pect of completing another. The anniver-
sary night of “Chu Chin Chow” was natu-
rally made the occasion for a big congratu-
latory roll-up by Oscar’s numerous brother-
and sister-Australian natives now in Lon-
don, and supplemented by a considerable
Cockney contingent they filled the capacious
house from floor to ceiling. Nobody would
have predicted 12 months ago that this spec-
tacular Oriental medley, a new version of
the old story of “The Forty Thieves,” was
destined to celebrate its birthday. Oscar
and Lily signalised the occasion with the
introduction of new and more gorgeous cos-
tumes than ever, additional musical num-
bers. and a fresh, wonderfully realistic
desert scene. The Daily Telegraph gently
remonstrates with Oscar over the “sensa-
tional—one might even say daring—dresses
in the mannequin scene,” and Oscar’s prim,
puritanical, native city of Geelong would
certainly hold up its hands in holy horror at
the sight of them.
To economise food Yankee plays are to
be Hooverised and the mummer in future
will have to guzzle cold-tea wine and sup
off papier-mache chicken. This ruling will
remove the only touch of reality from many
Yankdramas.

SOCIETY
MINCHINBURY
BLUR BALLAD.
[Fob The Bulletin.]
The black night-brats that whine about my pillow
Are weary company;
Bobbing with glee each swaying dream-negrillo
Grins wide at me.
But when the dawn, with pale lax fingers groping,
Limps through my window-pane,
I find myself incontinently hoping
For night again.
Dawn, bent to pull the plug with sloven slackness,
Lets out the tide of dark,
And, faint at first, from out the sinking blackness
Stand objects stark.
That square-edged isle that holds the shape of sable,
Deep-curved and rising sheer,
Is only proof that on the dressing-table
Is last night’s beer.
The dark grey ghost, in helpless posture sprawling
As though in death grotesque,
Is but the coat in which I’m daily crawling
From stool to desk.
The brownish fluff that, growing clear, is knotted
With strange white-twisted hills,
Resolves itself into my washstand, dotted
With unpaid bills.
So, one by one as on a bigot mission,
The dawn drags in his gifts,
Each one a mark of workaday attrition
And mean drab shifts.
The black night-brats have flown, but in their places
I rise for work to glimpse
The sharp teeth, lancet claws and hatchet faces
Of Day’s damned imps.

THE GUEST LIST.
HUSBAND: “ What made you ask that awful
Mrs. Potts to tennis? She’s right over
the odds.”
WIFE: “I know. But I like her hookety-up
skirts, and I wanted to get another
look at them.”
“Cleveland”: Smith enlisted about 18
months ago and was posted to the Light
Horse. The night before the unit sailed,
Smith, in the fervor of his leave-takings, got
considerably blithered and missed the boat.
He turned up at camp next morning, and
some brainy individual whispered to him that
as his papers had all gone with the unit the
best thing for him to do was to re-enlist.
Smith, sour and soreheaded, growled “Go-
terell!” or some other password, and went
home, subsequently taking up his civil job
where he had dropped it. Months rolled by,
and one day two duly-authorised persons
ploughed their way to the home of Smith’s
mother, and broke the news to her that he
(Smith) was missing. They also said that
her brave son had added fresh lustre to Aus-
tralian arms somewhere in France. Then
they left, mistaking the woman’s stupefac-
tion for silent grief. In the course of time
Smith again heard the call, and on this occa-
sion got safely away with my reinforcement,
finally reaching Salisbury Plains, where he
ascertained that the chap who had silently
stepped, into his vacant shoes on the ship had
fought in upwards of 11 battles and was now
posted as missing. Smith got to know of it
through being suspected of being the missing
soldier in disguise. They bore exactly the
same name, came from the same place, were
the same age. Headquarters are still scratch-
ing their ears and wondering what it all
means.
“Karee”; No game-shooting is allowed
near the line, but still a bit of it was done
in the Ypres sector, where are clumps of
wood and a lake near Dickebusch. We
often dined off wild duck and hare, and a
stray pheasant; but our ambition, or the
cook’s, was to bring down a wandering deer
or roebuck which optimists averred roamed
between Scottish and Suicide Woods and
Burmeister Farm. Kolodsky, our cook’s
offsider, an Italian or something, sneaked
out most nights. He nearly got frostbite
but nothing else until the memorable even-
ing he was put on the alert by the snapping
of a twig, followed by muffled footfalls. On
seeing a bush move Kolodsky let fly, and
two shots were answered by a fall, a
struggle and unmistakable grunts. The
bag was two Boches! One was dead and
the other close up. Brought up before the
skipper, the offsider owned up that he had
gone out after smaller game. He was duly
congratulated on his luck, and granted four
days’ stoppage of pay for being absent from
his lines and a mention in despatches for
having killed a German scout-officer and
man. The elusive “deer” ultimately turned
out to be a venerable and highly-perfumed
goat of the wrong persuasion.
* * * *
From a camp in England :—■
The peaked cap has gone, the only lid Billjim
may wear now on parade being the turned-up felt.
Orders to this effect were issued, but Bill regarded
the matter with his usual nonchalance and jambed
on the first lid that came to hand when “fall in”
sounded. Some of him hadn’t any felt hat, any-
how. Next morning a choleric colonel blew on to
the parade-ground and found us rigged out in varie-
gated headgear, the ratio of hats to caps being
about six to four. He roared like a bull and
solemnly promised that any man who appeared on
battalion parade next morning wearing a cap would
be shot, or words to that effect. Next morning
the Colonel was late, and when he arrived he was
the only man there wearing a cap. He looked over
us as we stood stiff and stark at attention, then
said between his teeth, “If my four felt hats are
back in my cubicle by 4 p.m. to-day no questions
will be asked. If not, the whole damn lot of you
will get an hour’s pack drill every night for a
month. Carry on!” I don’t know if he got his
hats, but we didn’t get the pack drill.
* * * *
“Trooper Bluegum”: I dined with the
Australian airmen at Rafa one night lately
and I felt like one of the Pay Corps in the
presence of a real soldier. All youngsters
keen as razors —anything from 20 to 25,
and they didn’t care a lost button if the
odds were on the foe. A submarine had
lately sunk a ship from England bringing
a consignment of the latest aeroplanes, and
the Australian airmen were flying in old
’buses that could do SO miles an hour while
Fritz ran rings round them aboard 120-mi le-
an-hour machines. Yet, in spite of this
disparity, the kids went up gaily day after
day. Some never came back. (Salute!)
Every time there is a call for pilots or
observers dozens of A.I.F. officers volun-
teer. But I have never yet seen an Aus-
tralian officer hero willingly take on a job
out of the danger line.
“Jimmy” : “Cyril Surcingle” (B. 15/11/T7)
mentions the absurd and wasteful method of
training the Citizen Forces. My own experi-
ence supports him. I have been at every
Citizen Force camp (they rejected me for the
A.1.F.) since compulsory service has been
the law. At the first camp, five years ago. I
was taught to form fours and turn to the
right, and was given a very detailed descrip-
tion of the position of attention. I was a
raw recruit then and it was all new. But
after five years’ training I and all my pals
are still being lined up with the recruits and
wearied to death with the stale elementarv
stuff by a more or less competent C.F. officer,
repeated six hours a day for eight continuous
days. I got so fed up this year that I
transferred to the A.M.C. It’s a bit more
interesting there because you can play poker
all day, have a read at the Y.M.C.A. or sit
around the doc. occasionally and hear a dis-
course on bandaging. I don’t know whether
anybody is out to deliberately kill our citizen
training system, the one bit of compulsion
we have; but it is only with difficulty I can
believe that a friend is responsible for the
administration.
THINGS WE HAVE TO STAND.
FOREMAN OF PRINTING MACHINE (to boy, regardless of the fact that the spring poet is
standing by watching the wheels go round) : “Screw that crank in, can't you?”
“Cadet L.8.M.” : I happen to be the only
Australian in the -—th Squadron of the
R.F.C. Two Canadian airmen are the only-
other “colonials” in the flock, and w-e new-
chums felt pretty happy until we were
handed typed slips headed “Rules for the
Guidance of YYmng Officers Joining —th
Squadron, R.F.C.” We remained quite calm
while we plodded through harmless stuff like
this: —
You are much more likely to be granted a favor if
you ask nicely than if you try to “hotstuff” it.
Remember always to rise when the C.O. enters the
ante-room.
But three freezingly-polite “colonials” lodged
a formal complaint after considering the
following
This is nasty, but necessary. If you are a newly-
commissioned Colonial officer, do not imagine that
the C.O. is nobody and the Adjutant less.
I may add that the Chesterfields responsible
for this bit of snobbery had not signed their
quaint handbill on manners.
AGREED AT LAST.
I haven't got a dress that I'm not ashamed
to go down the street in.”
“Em glad to hear you confess it! I've been
ashamed of them for months.”
“Liles”: They’ve watered the beer down
so industriously in England that Aussies
when ordering their pint ask for a glass of
legs and arms.” Ask ’em why they call it
that and they’ll tell you it has neither body
nor head. It’s a cruel war!
* * *
“Tralas”: He was a desert-stained Bill-
jim of the Camel Corps. He had just been
admitted to hospital and was palpitating
under the joint examination of the M.O. and
the sister. The doc. could not understand
his patient s. nervousness, till Bill eonfid-
ingly told him “he didn’t like the sisters
fiddling round him.” “Nonsense.” said the
doctor. “You’ll have them ‘fiddling round’
you a good deal before you’re better.” “Oh
well, ’ was the resigned answer, “I suppose
1 11 get used to them—same as I did the
camels.”
* * *
“1.5.”: Dear, dear, what mistakes the
most unerring of us can make! After Mrs.
A. had sorrowed without interruption over
the grave of her late husband for 18 months.
she arrived one fine day
at the cemetery laden
with the usual floral
offerings and found a
new tombstone inscribed
with a stranger's name
and virtues fixed above
poor Richard’s grave.
Very soon the inhabitants
saw a widow going at
full speed in search of a
cemetery clerk. Presently
V idow 8., who had
caused the new stone to
be put up, was discov-
ered, and a tearful argu-
ment raged. Widow B.
insisted that she was jus-
tified in having the tomb-
stone erected, as it was
her late husband’s burial
place. As the cemetery
trustees supported her,
M idow A., after appeal-
ing to the Board of
Health and various soci-
eties, demanded a disin-
terment, and when event-
ually’ the interesting
ceremonv came off she
was found to be right. Incidentally. Widow
A. is to foot the bill for the investigation
and removal of tombstone.
Huffin-Guffin ’: This war is making a
difference. They keep goats in Toorak now r .
I recently saw in large Toorakian grounds
about a dozen nannies and billies grazing.
As I stared over the park fence I saw a
humble bloke (probably a member of the
Melbourne Club in disguise) sneak up to the
tethered herd and start the evening milking.
Some simple Toorakese goatherd with all the
old Spartan virtues my yet lead us out of
the Wilderness of Debt!


SOMEWHERE IN FRANCE. NURSE FRANCES, V.A.D., writes of Clements Toivic.
The proprietors of one of the leading weekly newspapers, Wellington, N.Z., whose letter can be seen if necessary, writes:
“Nurse Frances has Just returned from the firing-line in France and used your Clements Tonic there. I m sure her
testimony is of veri great public value.” Nurse Frances herself writes; “I shou d like to tell you how very
pleased I am with your Tonic as a nerve restorer. I have used it with very beneficial results. Several of our
nurses in France have also proved its worth. I can highly recommend it to any one suffering from brain-iag.

“Dad” : Twelve of our chaps, three Bal-
larat boys among them, had made themselves
comfortable in the butt end of a German
trench well in advance of the crowd that had
just knocked out of old Fritz and
toppled him right off the hill. They were
waiting for the come-back, but I ritz was
showing noble reluctance to provoke a sec-
ond helping of the hot stuff he had just
sampled. Presently, however, the lieutenant
noticed a German creeping in their direc-
tion, taking cover where he could. The
officer held up a hand. “Don't shoot,” he
said. “We’ll have a live specimen. He’s
coming back to help a wounded comrade,
FAIR WARNING.
COACHIE (sotto voce, to mild curate):
“Lookee here, sir, we'll have to he care-
ful of our language while we've a lady
aboard!”
poor devil!” This seemed to be the truth.
The man was found to be busy on a fallen
German, and was presently ( surprised in the
act by two rifle muzzles and the pip of an
automatic pistol. “Were you going to take
him in?” asked the lieutenant, pointing at
the wounded man. “Nein ! nein !” protested
the Hun. “I forgot to save his trousers.
It is forbidden not to save his trousers.”
True enough, most of the dead and wounded
Germans were found to be trouserless. Evi-
THE DOUBTFUL COMPLIMENT.
THE LADY: “Guess whom I saw yesterday, Doctor!"
THE DOCTOR : “I don't know — I’m a very bad guesser."
THE LADY: “What nonsense —you at the top of your profession!”
dently a sudden shortage of those garments
had led to the issuing of an order command-
ing men to save trousers wherever possible.
It is characteristic of German method that
this hero was pulling the pants off his
wounded comrade when it would have been
far easier to have taken in the man.
“S.S.”: The death of Rodin reminds me
that there is somewhere in Melbourne a man,
or a few men, who should have a long job
whipping a large cat. These men are re-
sponsible for the fact that Melbourne Gal-
lery does not now possess some samples of
the most magnificent of Rodin’s work; in
fact, replicas of his
finest groups and
single figures—the
very marbles that the
sculptor presented to
the British nation a
year ago. When the
Australian artist Am-
brose Patterson re-
turned from Paris to
his native place he
brought with him
large photographs of
these statues and a
commission to dispose
of them to the Vic-
torian Gallery. The
works were Rodin’s
own replicas executed
with all the perfection
that marked the orig-
inals, and the price
was ridiculously low
remembering the
man’s market value,
even if one is careless
of his genius. The
offer was, however,
abruptly turned down,
and the Melbourne
Gallery lost a prize tliat would have adorned
any art collection on earth, and in the
possession of which any civilised community
might exult.
From a French soldier in Sydney
Your Premier Holman’s story about rent being
claimed for trenches is a bit hot. At any rate,
I’ve never seen it done. For one thing, original
owners of trench soil are usually refugees, 20 miles
or so back. The cockies certainly insist on payment
for billeting, and do you blame them ? A peasant
gets id. per horse in stable and per man sleeping in
a barn, and per officer supplied with bed and
room. The French or Belgian interpreter attached
to units settles all accounts, also any claims re
breakages. Should a unit elect to camp in a field
or picket horses or mules in same, no rent or dam-
ages are due, and no matter how careful a unit may
be there are always damages of some kind. At
Fleurbaix, for instance, two Australian ammunition
sections camped in a small grass paddock. When
they left there wasn’t a blade of grass —all was
I mud; the mules had “rung” a lot of fruit-trees,'
w r hile the men, having no coal, had used the fence as
a substitute. Yet the old lady just shrugged her
shoulders with a “C’est la guerre!’’ and the only
charge she made was the usual for the coffee and
rum.

“Captain F.”: He was a silent bushman
and we were never quite certain of him. I
never saw him laugh. During the German
retreat he was missing for two days. All
the wise ones sneered —“Knew he was. no
flaming good!” Then he turned up with
four Germans. During our chase he some-
how suspected a dug-out, and hid himself
handy for two days, at the end of which
time the rats came out and the human
terrier pounced. Asked why he brought the
prisoners up to tne front line instead of
going back, he replied, “Thought I’d have
to report for being absent first.” Later on
we found that during the two interminable
days he had existed on a couple of biscuits.
He is as silent as ever.

“Boyd Cable” : Although in the air there’s
no Hun trench to get over and one can float
across and look right down on any scrap
that’s going on downstairs, it’s sur-
prising how little one actually sees of
the dust-up. Looked at from above, the
lighting zone is merely a dirty brown strip
winding, across a green carpet. Wriggling
lines of trenches can be picked out, on our
side especially, but very faintly on the Hun
side because his trenches are shelled out of
any shape—much more so than ours. Spat-
tered about the green on either side of the
brown strip are puffy clouds of smoke, and
the brown itself is more or less hidden in a
drifting veil of smoke and dust, with little
winking flashes and pinpoints of fire. The
noise that on the ground deafens and half-
stuns you is drowned to the airman by the
roar of his own engine and shriek of the
wind, so that looking down on a battle is
something like looking at a. blurred and
smoky flickergraph show of it. Moreover,
the flying man is usually too busy minding
his own little job to worry much about the
groundlings, and when you’re casting
anxious eyes around and above and below to
spot the sudden arrival of Hun fliers, or
even when you’re circling round watching
for a particular shell to hit a particular
target, you’re apt to overlook battle
generalities. All this refers, of course, to
the high-fliers at 10,000 to 20,000 feet up-
The contour-chaser, the scout who flies up

even that is a mighty hasty 100-mile-an-hour
look.
The day that Fiji bubbled :
Lately, when the report was circulated that the
W as bringing six German prisoners, excitement
ran riot.
It was quite casually done. An Indian put in at
Levuka and reported that strange men were on
Wakaya. Word was flashed to Suva, and an order
given in reply that the was to be installed
with wireless and despatched to investigate. She
was carrying cattle and they were shielded with
tarpaulins. That little fact saved the ——. A
sub-inspector of police and two native police weie
sent ashore, unarmed. They met a beautifully -
equipped launch coming from the island with Count
Von Luckner, two lieutenants and three sailors, all
on their way to a schooner they had captured to
take them back to Germany. When they saw the
——• in the distance they imagined the cattle and
tarpaulin to be armed soldiers! So they surren-
dered —handed in their firearms, also their latest-
pattern machine-gun, the only one that F iji now
possesses, all because of a few sleepy, dull-eyed
cattle going to be slaughtered!
When the arrived in Suva with her freight
the excitement of the residents bubbled. Dinner at
the hotels was suspended. Cooks and guests all
tumbled down to the wharf. Natives, Indians, half-
castes, Samoans, Chinese, Japanese, whites, old and
young, jabbering, excited crowds, rushed to vantage
places. The prisoners were brought ashore by
native police, and the strong escort realised the neces-
sity of hurrying their captives into motor-cars.
They were driven to the Rest .House, a fine stone
building erected for natives when they visit the
capital. While in this building they were seen
signalling. So they were taken to the prison.
Their launch was discovered to be finely stocked.
There was a case or two of champagne, and about
£2OOO in English money aboard. Naturally the
question was asked —where was the remainder of
the crew? Wild rumors were circulated by Indians,
mostly that strange men were seen on the Rewa.
Instantly willing volunteers donned ill-fitting khaki,
shouldered their rifles and began a search. Messages
poured in that strange footprints were discovered
in certain places, and instantly a batch of armed
residents tore out in motor-cars. Despatch-riders
raced down the streets, motor-cars buzzed up and
down, day and night, carrying relieving guards.
Never in all its life had Fiji experienced such thrill-
ing thrills. Business was almost suspended. The
banks opened for two hours a day. Khaki-clad clerks
wearily served you, and you felt a culprit in needing
money at such a time. Then, after a week of sus-
pense, the bubble burst, and one breathed more
freely, yet with a certain amount of disappointment.
What it all means we don’t know even now. All
we do know is that at last the Germans of Fiji have
PROOF.

been interned and taken to an Australian port. They
demanded that they should be allowed to travel first-
class. The Governor, it is said, was willing, but for-
tunately the steamship co. refused. So, with an
armed guard, 49, women and children included, were
deported from their pleasant surroundings. They
confessed that they had had three years of freedom,
much to their surprise, and, as they had done good
work in more ways than is or ever will be known,
they took their removal philosophically.
THE ILLITERATE LOVERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Spell me her name with the apple-peel,
Spell it clear to my eyes!”
He had been watching the shadows steal
From the dark hills up to the skies,
While she, with her white and skilful hands,
Peeled apples rosy and bright.
“What’s the letter,” she said, “that stands
For the girl whom you love to-night?”
Back from his shadows and dreams he came,
And touched an apple round.
“Never an apple could tell her name,”
He sighed, “with its pleasant sound.”
“But try with this apple of' splendid size.
So sweet and fair,” urged she ;
“It was grown ’neath the blue of Australian
skies
On the sunny side of the tree.”
“Apples are evil, O lady fair !
They teach that all things fall
To earth, from the heights of dreaming rare,
And mankind most of all.
How shall we trust this one to say,
To tell what no man knows?”
“By using a knife in the proper way,”
She answered, “I suppose.”
So he took a knife and slowly flayed
That apple large and round.
The peel, all wriggling, fell and made
Strange patterns on the ground.
“Adam and Eve,” he rambled on,
“Could spell no more than I,
Yet they managed”. .. .A light in her dark eyes
shone,
And made him strangely shy.
In the warm, brow’n dusk, they both bent low.
Her hair just touched his cheek.
It filled his heart with a summer glow
Till he could scarcely speak.
And there on the earth was a ricketty E
And a V with a waist-line trim.
“Is the third an A or an E?” said she
In the scented darkness dim.
“You have tempted me thus with apple-peels,”
He said. “Now, read the name
That ever into my being steals
Like a wind that is warm with flame?”
She smiled with her lips, in a manner wise.
“Could I neither read nor write,”
She said, “I could spell the name, in your eyes,
Of the girl that you 10ve... .to-night.”

The great Rodin, just dead at 77, never
missed a chance to make money. Once, when
at the height of his fame, he delighted the
attractive Australian wife of another artist
by asking her if she would sit to him for a
portrait bust. The lady sat as requested,
and months later the treasure was duly deliv-
ered with the sculptor’s compliments. But
with it was a bill for a staggering number of
francs! The lady wept, her artist-husband
stormed, and finally the beautiful marble
was moaned over, re-packed in its straw-

Long, of Bathurst (N.S.W.), who is pack-
ing his gaiters for France, will be the first
Australian Anglican bishop in the field. His
selection was due to comparative youth
(43) and fine physique. His job is to be
that of fourth-class chaplain, which will, in
the military line, bring him below young-
sters who were still fagging at Melbourne
Uni. after he had bagged his M.A. Long’s
pulpit and platform speed, when he is
warmed up, equals that of any other public
man in Australia. Deakin would rank as a
steadygoer alongside him. Long will do a
lot of press writing for a Sydney daily

J. R. Hooper, who recently died at
Dunedin (M.L.), made the most of a long
life. Ninety-one years ago he was born in
London, and when he started to earn a
crust it was in the office of Willis, Gann and
Co., who ran the pioneer ships to M.L.
Hooper’s father was senior partner in the
firm, which was the beginning of the Shaw,
Savill and Albion Co. At 22 young Hooper
went to Mexico with a brother, and they
dabbled in mining ; then back to England and
off to M.L. in 1851. He had a spell after-
wards in Japan, but finally settled down in
Dunedin, where the inhabitants live to a
ripe old age on whusky.
Joe Davis, recently Director-General of
Works in N. S. Wales, is going off on a

always falls on his feet handy to the cup-
board.
Rabbi Danglow, of St. Kilda Synagogue
(Vie.), goes to the war. This is a return of
compliments, for very early in the proceed-
ings the war came to him when he was
aboard the German mail steamer Roon,
steaming from Colombo to Fremantle. One
afternoon the acute rabbi and others per-
ceived that the sun was setting in the wrong
place. That was the first intimation the
travellers got that the vessel’s course had
been changed in response to a wireless
whisper. The Roon finally stopped her
engines in the beastly little dead-end port of
Tjilatjap, Java.
Tommy Ryan, just elected to the Vic.
Assembly for Essendon, has at last resigned
his seat for Sturt (S.A.). The push of the
little man is well shown by his getting Vic-
torian electors to accept him before he was
really settled among them. His old asso-
ciates in the Trades and Labor Hall of
Adelaide had already done their best to
shunt him. They got his name moved from
the electoral roll of Sturt, as being a non-
resident ; but the Speaker of S.A. Assembly
ruled that this did not affect his sitting as
a member.
Private Wilfred Barber, killed
in France, was the only son of
that W. Barber whom most
Sydney Uni. men of the past
quarter-century will remember
as assistant to the “yeoman
bedell” on the Uni. staff. Young
Barber was rejected at his first
offer for the A.1.F., so he went
to England and made muni-
tions for 12 months. Return-
ing to Sydney, he was accepted
for the fighting ranks, and had
been wearing Australian khaki
nearly two years before the end
came.
Old Peter Rasmussen, who
died at Apia, Samoa, lately,
was by way of being a walking
picture-gallery. He was a
Danish sailor, and as a memento
of shipwreck on the group in
1868 he was tattooed from
neck to ankles in the best
fa’a-Samoa fashion. Peter had
a bad time at the hands of the
brown artist, but the recom-
pense lay in the fact that it
was a chief’s tattoo, and so
gave him mana among the
Island folk and assured him
plenty of kaikai and the pick
of the giddy young things of
Upolu. For many a year he
was the boss man of the
big Mulifanua plantation, and
there weren’t many better
authorities on things native. Peter had seen
many a queer happening in war-vexed
Samoa; he had dodged bullets, tomahawks
and head-knives, and if he had only taken it
into his head to write a book it would have
been the real stuff in South Sea romance.

machines and earn-
ing the M.C. He

incidentally was the Synod’s leading autho-

escapes while making sketches for the official

Once he was injured in the face, and another

Latest news is that he has been wounded in
an arm and leg, the injuries being painful
but not serious. He is now in Blighty being
nursed by Mrs. Bill, known to Bulletin

most is that the explosion made a sketch oyer
which he had expended much pains look like

POSTS AND RAILS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He stumbled up the ridges
With his old cattle-dog ;
He took his maul and wedges
From underneath a log—
His wedges, maul and crosscut,
So light to drive and draw ;
And he rubbed well with suet
The dew-rust on the saw.
He marked a tree and felled it,
As lone-hand splitters do ;
He measured it and cut it —
The cuts were straight and true.
And all day in December,
When dust and heat prevails,
From out the groaning timber
He belted posts and rails.
He’d come across the water ;
His thoughts were far away—
His little fair-haired daughter
Was buried yesterday,
And till the sun was setting,
And milk-cows sought the yard,
He worked like one forgetting,
And never worked so hard.
His hope was now a far light
And dim across the seas ;
He would have worked by starlight
His aching heart to ease ;
But up the dark’ning siding,
Beneath the fading dome,
His eldest son came riding
To take his father home.
The posts and rails are rotten,
And vanished is the plough ; *
The homestead is forgotten—
The place a “stud farm” now.
And sullen touts are shirking,
Where men, in days gone by,
Died hopeless, but died working,
When their turn came to die.
I'd rather—oh, I’d a rather,
When weary and way-worn,
My little foreign father
Had died where he was born.
I know not what the curse is ;
But I, when daylight fails,
From long years of reverses
Sit splitting posts and rails.

Since the year’s accounts were issued the
T. & G. has suffered a great loss by the
sudden death of J. McK. Henry, its general
manager and secretary. When he was
brought from Maoriland to take hold of the
society it was in a poor way. It had
drifted into the backwater, and when an
insurance office gets there it takes a lot of
shifting. Every policy it gets has to be
fought for; and then it has to fight to keep
the business. Henry, backed up by John
Sutherland, the actuary, resolved upon a
daring policy. New tables were produced
at which older or more conservative actu-
aries were perturbed. They frankly did not
believe that the society was justified in mak-
ing such offers. Had the society not im-
proved its expense rate and its earnings, it
might have got into difficulties. But Henry’s
policy justified itself to this extent, at any
rate—it brought business in a volume previ-
ously unknown to the office, the expense
rate was reduced by about 71 p.c. in the
Ordinary department and 15 p.c. in the
Industrial, and the interest earnings were
improved by over 1 p.c.
Look first at the expense rate: —
Expenses Compared with Total Income.
Sept., Ordinary. Industrial.
1905 .. £2l 1 1 p.c. £52 18 2 p.c.
1910 .. 22 19 7 „ 38 4 4 „
1913 .. 15 1 0 „ 36 0 1 „
1914 . . 14 18 8 „ 38 10 3 ~
1915 .. 13 9 11 „ 36 5 8 „
1916 .. 13 14 11 „ 35 7 3 „
1917 .. 15 10 2 „ 35 7 9 „
That rate for Ordinary business is not ex-
ceptionally good. There are offices which
show better figures. But taking into account
the new business secured, the present rate is
distinctly satisfactory. Assume that the old
or renewal business last year cost 7 p.c.,
then the new business cost 69 p.c. of the
first-year premiums received; and that is
exceptionally cheap business, especially as
the policies issued were for amounts averag-
ing less than £145 each. The Industrial
organisation has no doubt been a powerful
factor in producing this result. But there is
no reason to suspect that exes, properly
chargeable to the Ordinary department have
been loaded on to the Industrial; for, though
£35 7s. 9d. p.c. is a lot to cut out of every
£lOO paid up by these latter policy-holders, it
compares well with the experience of other
offices. The reduction of nearly p.c. in
the Ordinary expense rate in the past seven
years means a saving of £19,000 per year on
the present premium income. Assuming that
the present expense rate can be maintained,
this means, roughly, that the society could
afford to offer present policy-holders £400,000
more than it could have done had the old
expense rate been maintained.
The management lias been less responsible
for the improvement in the interest earnings :
Interest Earnings p.c. of Average Funds.
1910 ..£4 10 6 p.c. I 1914 ..£4 12 6 p.c.
1911 .. 410 9 ~ 1 1915 . . 413 0,,
1912 .. 4 11 0 „ I 1916 .. 4 14 7 „
1913 .. 4 11 6 ~ ! 1917 .. 417 6 „
In the Ordinary department the improve-
ment of 7s. p.c. shown in the past
seven years means a gain of £5325
a year on the present funds and £3ooo
in the Industrial department; and, it
anything, a further improvement may be
expected. Capitalise this gain at 5 p.c.
and you get an improvement oi £166,300 in
the Ordinary and £71.000 in the Industrial
department. McHenry did not live long
enough to prove conclusively that he was
right and his critics were wrong; but they
will at least admit that on the present
figures he is far more likely to have been
right than seemed probable a few years ago.
John Sutherland signed his last actuarial
report for this office in 1913, and H. M.
Jackson has since been issuing the annual
certificate. He declares the surplus in the
Ordinary department for the past year to be
£47,964, of which £43.487 is distributed,
equal to about 171 p.c. of the premiums. In
the Industrial department the ascertained
surplus was £33.122. of which £13,418 is
distributed on account of certain policies.
The least satisfactory feature of the business
on the books is the small proportion of
whole-life policies in force. Of a total of
£6,193,283. insured, whole-life policies stand
for only £873,749. Yet this paper says once
more that, for the young man of small means
who wants to make the largest possible pro-
vision for a wife and family, the whole-life
policy is the one that ought to have first con-
sideration. It will be quite time for him to
turn to endowment policies when, having
made some other provision for his family, he
is looking for investments, or when he can
no longer satisfy the doctor that he is a
good subject for the whole-life table.
Only one other feature remains to be
glanced at, and that is the nature of the
funds. Though this paper has doubts about
the wisdom of large investments in freeholds
for insurance purposes, in other respects, at
any rate, the investments have lately changed
for the better: —
1913. 1917.
Government and municipal securities 36.0 p.c. 42.8 p.c.
Loans 49.2 „ 38.3 „
Freeholds .. .. .. .. 12.3 „ 14.3 „
Cash and sundries . . . . . . 2.5 ~ 4.6 ~
Public securities have been practically
doubled in these four years—from £570,000
to £1,130,000. Yet something more might
reasonably have been done. In the past two
years £572,000 has been received in excess of
outgoings and only £416,000 has been added
to the investment in War Loans and other
public securities.

The profits for the past four years don't look
as good as those for the four years prior to
the outbreak of war; but notice a couple of
things: (1) There has been a steady im-
provement for the past three years; (2)
£l4OO was reserved to provide for deprecia-
tion of leaseholds in 1916 and a further £3OO
in the past year, and these amounts are not
included with the profits. No co. with ad-
vances to protect or stock on its shelves can
make its accounts more than an estimate;
and when the clouds are dark and the future
uncertain, it is natural enough for a manage-
ment to make exceptional provision for con-
tingencies. This co. had £153,000 out in
advances at the balance a month or two after
war started ; and the apparent shrinkage in
subsequent profits may have been due partly
to more liberal provision for bad and doubt-
ful debts. In any case, there is a nice mar-
gin in excess of the dividend ; and the posi-
tion has been further improved, in this
paper’s opinion, by the reduction of advances:
1900. 1910. 1916. 1917.
Debts due on
mortgage ..£78,000 £45,000 £45,000 £45,000

Leaseholds .. 9,086 8,786
Advances, etc.. . 173,082 170,634 192,139 150,467
Of the present advances, etc., £15,000 is War
Loan ; so that advances proper are substanti-
ally less. And though advances against wool
and other produce sent for sale are mostly
sound enough and often unavoidable, the
fewer general advances that wool-broking
and stock-selling firms make the better. There
is generally a tendency to take a risk for the
sake of securing commission business.
The eo.’s capital is £lOO.OOO. and the undi-
vided profits have now crept past that total.
In the last 10 years, besides paying a divi-
dend averaging only a shade under 10 p.c..
an amount equal to nearly three-fourths of
the capital has been accumulated. This has
enabled the co. to pay off nearly £60.000 of
debt and spend £20.000 on premises. The
freeholds, which have cost the co. £190,626
now stand in the books at £143.112 ; the old
goodwill item, originally £40,000, has been
completely wiped out; and, as shown above,
there is a reserve of £l7OO against the lease-
hold. which cost £10,486. Assuming that the
advances are good, the strength of the co.’s
position has thus been very substantially in-
creased ; and, with over £2 of assets net for
every £1 of capital, after writing off the
whole of the goodwill and £47,513 from free-
hold property account, shareholders may
reasonably conclude that the management has
made them very comfortable.

This is the co. which has joined with the
three Sydney breweries to save Bung from
Bung. Until lately all attempts to bump up
retail prices to meet the increased cost of
beer were frustrated by the price-cutter. So
the licensed victuallers’ associations in most
of the States made an arrangement with the
breweries whereby the former constitute
themselves a sort of price-fixing Board, and
the brewers act as policemen to see that
Bung adheres to the prices decided upon.
The only benefit the breweries get from this
arrangement is alleged to be that “they
know they are dealing with solvent people.”
Anyhow, something had to be done in the
matter of prices. The Castlemaine and
Wood Co. has been affected in this way by
trading restrictions, taxes and increased cost
of materials:—
1914. 1915. 1916. 1917.
Receipts . . £90,858 £107,874 £110,698 £102,537
Expenses . . 63,182 80,744 90,923 84,547
Trading profit £27,676 £27,130 £19,775 £17,990
The position is not likely to improve for
some time, either. Beer ingredients may
remain at about present prices, but con-
sumption cannot be expected to increase
much even in Newcastle, while cost of pro-
duction will remain high- and additional
taxation is certain.
According to the co.’s balance-sheet, re-
serves amount to £48,500, but goodwill as
written down still figures at £3o,ooo—hence
the reserves of £18,500 shown above. Going
back 10 years gives this comparison :
1907. 1915. 1916. 1917.
Liabilities . . £60,896 £101,926 £105,242 £104,572
Properties, 1

Bills, cash, etc. 9,159 4,048 987 3,451
Stock . . . . 22,959 33,118 35,988 34,157
So while capital has remained at £250,000,
liabilities to the public have increased by
£43,676. On the other side, the brewery,
plant, etc., are now worth more than when
10 years ago these items were lumped with
goodwill, and £23,816 has been added to pub
properties, etc. Of course, all depends on
the basis of valuation; and. as to
that, notice that in 1912, on a re-
valuation, assets were actually written up.
As to the future, it’s no use guessing. The
last couple of assaults by the prohibitionists
have failed before the attacks had properly
developed. So far as this co. is concerned, it
has at its doorstep a big and growing indus-
trial field which will never vote itself dry.
The market, however, sees no joy in the
future, and is willing to pay no more than
9s. 9d. for the co.’s £1 shares—a price which
rewards the plucky with a return of about 8
p.c. p.a.

The history of this eo. is good ,
pessimists. There are plenty n f d !. Clne for
wlneh have restored wrPSV ,S»*
selling the written-down properties -n
prices after hanging on to them for a ? S
.rears. But this co. lias restored the >vh | V
of the written-off capital and still ]La 0
to a great part of the old
perty and other assets, though they ,wi
stand now at their lowest writtenlwn
value—they were revalued and written
bit in 1907. Still there is no doubt ?h if
the co. had three or four years ago I
to sell the properties in possession at hit
values, then about £74 000, it wouldn’t have
had to look long for buyers. Apparently !
few more properties have fallen in sin™
then, so that the item stands now at £76 979
which is very nearly half of the gross asset?
Total assets are £172,518, and the balanee
consists of mortgages £55,553, St Josenh’l,
Buildings £12.000, and deposits, etc The
average assets last year were approximately
16 ?i ( ?^nVi tlle , ! r \ tei : est an d rents amounted
to £l3.i 99. which is equal to about £8 3s
p.c. on the lot. From which it is
pretty clear that some of the properties in
possession are producing a great return
No doubt they are not all young ’uns- vet
the repairs account doesn’t average more
than £lOO a year.
The capital, which was down tn
£28,588 in 1900, has been restored to
£95,292; and all liabilities total £4B 008
This includes £36,249 of old debt. When the
society got into the usual trouble in 1892 it
owed about £300,000. It went ahead realis-
ing where it could and paying off when it
could, until 10 years ago it owed only
£74.000. Then, taking advantage of recent
legislation, it made an arrangement with its
creditors to pay off the debt by 20 annual
instalments. That gives the society nine or
10 years to get rid of the remaining £36,000.
Meantime, however, as opportunity offers, it
is buying up these old deposits in advance;
and probably very substantial discount could
be earned that way. As a building society
St. Joseph’s hasn’t much of a future; almost
everywhere the State is too anxious to assist
people to build homes of their own to allow
Private Enterprise to make much out of the
business. And the co. seems to have gone
right out of land-subdivision, in which there
have been such glorious pickings during the
last few years. But the co. looks as though
it might sit down quite comfortably as a
landlord who bought well, and has also a
few thousands to invest in safe mortgages.

The co. has acted very discreetly in transfer-
ring £lOO,OOO from undivided profits to capi-
tal, which enables the directors to pay away
the same amount in dividend and call it 124
p.c. instead of 25 p.c. The reserves as at
September 30, 1916, were £418,431. The
premium income for that year was £161,932.
It is generally reckoned by conservative in-
surance men that an underwriter has made
fair provision for unexpired risks if he has
40 p.c. of the year’s premiums put by. In
this case that would mean £64.770. Always
(having its headquarters in Dunedin) in-
clined to have saxpence or so more in hand
than necessary, the unearned premium re-
serve of this co. was £66.000 at that date.
Deduct this from the reserves = £352.431. So
at September 30, 1916, the co. had in the
business £452.431 of its own money; and the
dividend was equal to only 54 p.c. upon that.
It was rather absurd, therefore, to do any-
thing that might give the impression that
the co. was making 25 p.c. out of the busi-
ness.
As a matter of fact, the co.’s investments
earned more than enough interest in the past
year to pay all the dividend, leaving the
whole of the profit from the business avail-
able to meet future claims. No doubt the
fact that the capital has been small has
made it easier to catch hold of the amount
paid out in dividend and keep it down. That
meant a pretty rapid growth of reserves.
At the same time, while there has been a
steady growth of business, there has bem'
nothing phenomenal about it. The joint
result is that the funds are now extraordi-
narily large compared with the risks as
measured by the premiums. It is general!}
a fair thing if a co. has funds equal to some-
thing between 150 p.c. and 175 p.c. of tne
year’s premiums. The National of Maon-
land has 330 p.c. It has assets equal to

But whereas Government taxes used to keep
under £6OOO prior to the war, they were
£11,827 last year; and the extra £6OOO or
thereabouts means, say, 3.8 p.c. Apart from
taxation, exes, have thus been smaller than
usual. The only other point calling for
notice is the investment of the funds. These
directors had for many years a partiality for
mortgages, a form of security which was* pro-
bably more common down south in Maori-
land than any other; but since war started
all the funds that have become available
have been put into “debentures,” presumably
War Loan. Loans on mortgage stand at
£306,685 ; “debentures” £172,949 —together
65 p.c. of the gross assets. The balance con-
sists of freeholds (£9BOO =lf p.c.) and cash
and agency balances. There is, by the way,
a quaint sign of the times in the auditors’
report: “The S. Australia branch vouchers
for August and London branch vouchers for
March quarter were lost in the Pt. Kembla
and Mongolia respectively.”

The large amounts written off go to the
reduction of plant account. The directors
say this year that they “consider it wise to
continue to write it down.” No other explana-
tion is offered. Probably the co. has on hand
plant which has been superseded ; for these
are special appropriations. Which seems to
mean that the figures shown in the first
column are profits less ordinary depreciation.
If this is so, the position looks very
pleasant, for the special appropriations must
end soon. Capital is £121.500; and, though
stocks run into £72,931 and premises and
plant into £54,922, book debts are kept
within bounds, so that the liabilities at the
end of the half-year did not exceed £35,010.

Mining cos. controlled from Sydney have,
as a rule, had precious little of the bulldog
about them. The June. North is in the short
list of exceptions; and the Palmers have
been mainly responsible for it. This meant
an optimism which, though it kept the
wheels turning, was sometimes humorous to
the person who could look on coldly from
the outside; aud the misfortune even now
is that there doesn’t seem the least likeli-
hood of the stickers getting decently recom-
pensed. Still, the shareholder is nearer a
bite than he has been for many years. When
the directors came to the sad conclusion
that they didn’t have much of a mine left
(there are only 200,000 tons of ore devel-
oped, and little "chance of finding much more)
it plunged in slimes, and to raise the wind
borrowed at Shylock rates of interest.
Almost all this debt has now been paid off:
total liabilities on September 30 were
£10,798. On the other side there were float-
ing assets valued at £160,473. It is worth
while making a list of them :
Cash balances . . . . . . . . £14,073

Concentrates on floors .. . . • • 36,926

Sundry debtors .. .. . . .. 34,067
Ore purchased on floors . . . . 10
Total . . . . . * . • £160,473
Those sundry debtors include German metal
firms which owe £9SGO on final settlements
under old contracts. This debt may be a
lot better than it looks. There is a super-
stition that the upas-tree has been pulled up
and the German canker cut out of the metal
market; but it is far more likely that the
upas-tree is still growing fine crops of
cankers. The German metal magnates
move in a mysterious way their waistcoats
to adorn ; and the chances are that, if they
haven’t been permitted to make as much out
of their own country as our own metal-mining
patriots have made out of us ana our Allies,
they have made a nice bit out of the U.S.A.,
and, through the U.S.A., out of Britain and
France.
The Junction North had to send 31,924
tons of its dumped slimes and 17,427 tons of
crude ore to the treatment plants last half-
year to make its gross profit of £19,729, or
about £18,200 if you deduct what it actually
spent on the plant during the term. But
the profit is more or less of a guess, because
the co. had concentrates which it values at
£37.000 on the floors at the end of the year,
and much depends upon what they finally
realise. It has an agreement with the Asso-
ciated Smelters to take its lead concen-
trates ; but as the capacity at Fort Pirie is
limited the co. has been working part of
its mill only two days a week. As for zincs,
of which it produces just about as much as
of lead concentrates, it was compelled to
join the Zinc Producers’ Asssoc., and there-
upon the directors make this remark:—
The buyers expressed satisfaction with the quality
of the concentrate we delivered and made us a
definite offer in writing for our estimated output for
the years 1918 and 1919. The offer was entirely suit-
able to our requirements, and we requested the Zinc
Producers’ Association to accept it on our behalf on
June 19, 1917 ; the committee has not yet accepted
the offer, although it has sold large quantities of
zinc concentrates for every other co. since then for
future delivery. Further information about this
offer and our connection with the Association will be
given at a meeting of shareholders in Sydney on
November 22.
The zinc concentrate delivered under recent
contracts went to Japan.
War prices will end suddenly; but good
prices for metals should be available after
the war. The co. should therefore easily get
its money back for the purchased slime still
dumped at the mine, and there should be
some profit also in the 200,000 tons of ore.
as it is all ready for stoping. For the rest
the future is very doubtful, the prospect
of making considerable purchases of eithei*
ore or slimes being poor. Anything that the
Junction North may pay must therefore be
regarded as return of capital.
From one of the prospectors and vendors:
The way the Goobarragandra (N.S.W.) is being
handled away from the mine isn’t fair to us or
the people who bought shares on our representa-
tions. There were plenty of reports about the
concern when bnly money was going out in plant,
shaft-sinking, etc., but, later, when there have been
satisfactory developments in the mine, a deep
silence is the only thing that has been heard. In
a tunnel put in to crosscut the lodes at a depth two
highly-payable reefs have been met, one disclosing
values up to nearly £4O per ton, but about this
absolutely nothing is known by the majority of the
shareholders. High prices were at one time paid
for shares in the belief that big values would be
won; but when a large parcel of ore was treated
and returns were far below anticipations prices
came down with a run. The whole trouble was
that the values in the ore were not recovered, the
bulk being lost—which could easily happen- oh
account of the gold being very fine and through
the nature of the stone in which it was contained.
On the developments at the mine I believe it has
great prospects; but this policy of secrecy is lead-
ing people to sacrifice shares and doing no good to
the reputation of the men who were responsible for
introducing the show to the public.

W. H. Cundy (surveyor), Donald Clark
(metallurgist) and Angas Mackay (news-
paper owner) are sponsors for Central Nell
Gwynne, Bendigo. The main thing to be
said about the claim is that it is a position
block within the rich zone embracing Great
Extended Hustlers, Garden Gully and Lan-
sell’s No. 180. The bit of scratching done by
the old miner ended at 420 ft., and the new
programme is to test the big slide below that
point at its intersection with centre country.
This proposition has at least as much merit
as most of the bob shows patronised by the
Beehive. Bendigo certainly won’t revive
itself by putting its head on the pillow.
* * * *
Some of the last Bendigo Amalgamated
crushings are deplorable: Virginia, 1348
tons for 6s. per ton; Carlisle 1441 tons and
Constellation 642 tons for 15s. per ton. The
month’s run of 11,565 tons only gave 27650 z.,
which can’t more than pay exes, and pro-
vide for a little development. Of course
the collapse at the Carlisle 1140 south level,
together with the smash-up of the winding
plant, cut off some of the best-grade stone
from the mill. Dyason intends to stab into
the Paddy’s Gully centre-country with the
diamond drill at 669 ft. to try what lies
under the big fault there. His bag of speci-
mens got at 1500 ft. in workings off the
Garden Gully main shaft tipped the scales at
loz. per lb. This patch seems to have been
Nature’s final effort at this point. At 2240
in Koch’s the reef got smaller and poorer.
Things are more promising at the old
Johnson’s No. 2 shaft; but, taken generally.
Dyason hasn’t had a scrap of luck since he
hammered his big show into shape. Bendigo,
however, is a place of surprises, and another
three months may alter everything.
Dargo Prop., after hiding its head in the
snows of the High Plains for five years, is
being transplanted to Mount Murphy, at
the back of Benambra (Vic.). Alluvial isn’t
on the menu this time, the sustaining diet
prescribed by J. C. Dunster being from 1 to
5 p.c. wolfram. What that means per ton
in £ s. d. is not detailed in any of the stories
that have come this way. Still, as Queen-
street is jubilant over a 1 p.c. wolfram
formation at King Island, it looks as if
Dunster, with a quarter-mile dyke to frivol
over and six parallel veins of up to 6 p.c.
stuff to macerate, will have a chance to get
arrayed as gloriously as Solomon. The
nigger in the wood-pile is the advent of a
syndicate. This is credited with having
mopped up 50,000 shares. But, apart from
that, if all in the garden is so prime, why
are 4s. paid shares floating round at Od. a
piece. Is the selling due to kindness? Or
does somebody want to get on velvet at a
very early stage of a new mining flutter?
Golden Butterfly has apparently drawn
another blank in Tuckabianna (W.A.). Bat-
tery returns were considerably below assay
values recorded in the progress reports, and
many t’othersiders who bought on the
strength of official estimates have fallen in.
There are several shows in the neighborhood
which have yielded rich returns, and the
Butterfly may fluke some, too, but nothing
having the appearance of permanency has
yet been found there. The Butterfly was
told this in a special report furnished by an
expert some time ago.
Edna May Battler (W.A.) is in the midst
of financial reorganisation, and to help
matters shareholders have been informed (1)
that several gold-bearing lodes, apparently
cross-reefs, are likely to junction with the
main body at a depth of from 300 ft. to 400 ft.,
and (2) that they can reasonably expect not
only larger formations but a recurrence of
sensational gold deposits characteristic of
Westralia. All The Bulletin can promise
them is disappointment. The Battler is too
small for a co. of this sort.
* * * *
Years ago a rich deposit of telluride of
gold and silver was struck in the Hidden
Secret at the north end of the Kalgoorlie
field, and from it a local syndicate, mostly
Italians, obtained a lot of money. Then the
shoot cut out. Now after more years of
unsuccessful prospecting in deeper ground
the owners want the Mines Department to
send along a geologist to help in the search.
The late ex-Federal Labor Minister Charlie
Fraser was a shareholder, but he bought in
after most of the gold had been taken out,
and did not benefit much.
There was far less bite in his election
policy speech than in Alec Peacock's half-
yearly report on Edna Consolidated. Man-
ager J. M. Aldridge backs Peacock up by
testifying that the mine has 40,000 tons of
50s. ore in sight. With the levels shallow,
costs ought not to be above 255. per ton, so
that on a register of 65,000 shares the pro-
fits should represent roughly the market
price of scrip. Aldridge’s values explain why
some of the fat jobbers have frozen so tight
on to the show. A width of 65ft. is allotted
to the Middle reef bulge. Length isn’t yet
recorded, but with a 15dwt. average to draw
on Aldridge shouldn’t need to worry if a
few blank spots are met. He can spice up
with his 20ft. of 22dwt. dirt said to be in
sight at the Main reef. Per contra, Perth,
building on the fact that the hardest job
undertaken by most Westonia managers has
been to live up to estimates, steadily plugs
away at Consolidateds. These bears put the
late lOdwt. crushing down as the very best
the mine can do. Well, the new battery is
to play with 2500 tons monthly, so it will
soon be known who is backing the right
horse. Aldridge advises that he intends to
run to a 40s. grade. That perhaps explains
why the initial run of the mill didn’t come
up to the expectations of the market.
“Bad Australian” from S. America :
When I first knew Chuquicamata (Northern Chile),
about 12 years ago, it was a typical Spanish-American
mining camp with a population of 500 or 600 toughs
and homicides, the chief industries being robbery
varied by gambling and bandicooting the richer veins
which traverse the immense deposits of low-grade
copper ore. These deposits and those of El Abra,
about 18 miles further north, were worked by the
Incas. The remains of the slagheaps and an occa-
sional copper-cured mummy and bronze drill or chisel
found in the old workings testify to this.
Chuquicamata would probably be the same old
suburb of Gehenna if the Guggenheims, under the
guise of the Chile Copper Co., hadn't taken hold
and straightened the place out commercially and
socially. After about a year of experimenting, the
co. decided to adopt the electrolytic process, and a
power plant capable of transmitting 110,000 volts,
was installed at Tocopilla, about 75 miles away. A
pipe line was constructed to supply the works witli
water, Chuquicamata being in the rainless belt, and
a small city was built for the accommodation of the
administration and workmen. Railroad tracks and
stock, steam shovels, crushers and leaching tanks
were installed, and the plant is now handling 10,000
tons of ore daily and producing 7,000,0001 b. of copper
per month. Not satisfied with these results the
owners are planning a treatment plant calculated to
handle about 27,000 tons per day—and all this is
being done with a mountain of ore which averages
about 2 p.c.
Just 10 years ago, recognising the possibilities of
the Chuquicamata and El Abra copper deposits, I
tried to interest British capital in their develop-
ment, but the animal merely snorted and advised me
that there were no end of wild-cats much nearer
home. And when 1 think of what my cut rtiight
have been if that supercilious animal had as much
science and enterprise in its composition as its
Yankee-German relatives, it leaves me cold and exas-
perated.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
DAVID
JONES
FOR
SMART
MILLINERY
Sydney, November 26, 1917.
Aly Dear Akim, —
The big fair in the Town Hall for St.
Alary’s building fund was opened with, a
flourish. Crowds wedged their way towards
the platform to hear the new Papal Dele-
gate, Archbishop Cattaneo, give his blessing
to the affair. He’s a genial, humorous-look-
ing prelate, who kissed his hand to those
present when his English gave signs of
exhaustion. The stalls will collect the
ultimate copper from those who pass their
way till December 10.
On the platform was Justice Ileydon, who
recently rapped the knuckles of Dr. Alannix.
As the Papal Delegate’s millinery floated
past, his Honor, coming forward, kissed the
Anostolic ring and retired to his nook in
the organ seats. Tom Hughes, AI.L.C.,
bowed low, sat near his friend the Judge.
Guess Premier Holman didn’t know,
when he stayed at the St. Francis Hotel in
’Frisco, that a fellow-lodger—though she
didn’t know it at the time either —was Airs.
Norman Rogers, from Goulburn. She didn’t
find out till she picked 1 up a local chatter-
paper and read this :
The distinguished citizens of the reception com-
mittee waited in the lobby of the St. Francis Hotel
on Monday morning for Premier Holman, of New
South Wales, to come downstairs and be received.
But the Premier did not come. His secretary
telephoned explanations—various explanations—from
time to time, and the distinguished citizens con-
tinued to wait.
The true explanation did not come until the desk
clerk called Eddie Rainey over and explained thus:
“That guy can’t come down till we find his shoes.”
Like a true Britisher, Premier Holman had put
his only pair of shoes outside the door the night
before to be cleaned. Someone mistook them for a
gift for Belgium.
“Our Day” is November 30 —not that you
can forget it. When Friday dawns the flag
and badge stalls will be fluttering their
pennons. There are two opinions as to the
wisdom of cutting out the ordinary trading.
It’s a beautiful and uplifting thing to give
something to the Red Cross and get nothing
but an inch or two of bunting in return.
But—well, the homely rasher and the reli-
able egg have brought a welter of cash to
every Australian war fund hitherto.
The Alunro Fairgusons get back to Alel-
bourne from the West on November 30. Then
on to Sydney by December 4.
The French-Australian League of Help,
which mothers Frangois-of-the-Islands on his
way to or from the Big Fight, gave a delight-
ful water-party to a recent contingent.
Fiance is calling up her 19 to 21 class, and
her possessions at this end are being combed
for eligibles. “Only old women, children
and old men left now,” said one of the lads
in grey-blue the other afternoon. “And they
are doing what they can. Here is my
twin-brother’s picture,” and he points to
a little medallion on his breast. “He was
killed in France. I go to take his place.
What will you ? It must be. Of our family,
only the old grandmother is left!” Sydney
women picked their way through school-
French as the big snub-nosed steamer lent
by the Sydney Ferries forged ahead for
Cabarita. Not a syllable of English had
the visitors in their kit! Colored soldiers
who go to fight for France were the kiddies
of the company. They rushed the swings
and see-saws, stuck bright blooms behind
their ears, and sang Tahitian part-songs all
the way home. Captain Sicard and Lieut.
Raynaud were in charge of the lively com-
pany. Airs. Joseph Playoust, Aliss Gurney,
Airs. Jewett, the Alaymans, Airs. Angele
Higinbothom and Air. Shard were among the
hosts.
Brown brother in the uniform of incompar-
able France has been a source of delight
to Sydney for the last couple of weeks.
Churches attract him more than beer. And
zoos perhaps more than churches. He
haunts every brand of theology, darts in
and out St. Alary’s, squats on St. James’s
steps, puts his merry grin round the demure
doors of Scotchbyterian kirks. And if you’ll
go over to the Zoo wharf (and chance get-
ting soaked, for there’s no shelter-shed)
you’ll find him by the score waiting for the
gates to open.
One of the most successful among recent
comforts shows was the Aliners’ Corps affair
opened by the Cullen lady in the Oxford
Hall. Airs. David, wife of the gallant old
Professor who helped to form the Corps
(remember its tunnelling at AlessinesV), is
on the other side. In her place as president
reigns Air. Brain. Airs. Clunies Ross is
hon. sec. and Dr. Cohen’s wife is a hard-
working hon. treasurer. About £2OO fell
into the till in the recent raid. A fruit and
vegetables stall —such pineapples and
’taties ! —wms the housewives’ hub.
A cretonne girl sitting in a cretonne stall
at the Economy Exhibition was a floral island
entirely surrounded by chintz —boxes, para-
sols, bags and hats. The millinery is
attractive and shady, and the bags are
roomy enough to hold the socks-in-making,
groceries and coupons of a blameless life. The
cretonne vogue was advertised by Farmer’s
show at the Town Hall, and a few thousand
girls will presently try it on the seaside
spectators, or run up and down Govett’s
Leap in the lively drapery. What the
mountain wallaby will think of a flower-bed
dashing through the scrub is not likely to
appear in print.
Through the clarion call to the sock
brigade you may still catch the small, plead-
ing voice of the beautiful Home for Incur-
ables at Ryde. The Home started in an
old cottage at Redfern in 1900. Later on
Henry Aloses, AI.L.C., offered Weemala, with
42 acres of land, at half its value. The
committee scraped the money together and
bought the haven. Saturday’s Rite in the
grounds brought in about £240. As the
chief workers were amongst the Incurables
it’s a fine result.
Airs. Lewis, who used to be Gertrude
Tait, superintendent of the Commonwealth’s
little nursing army in Papua, came home
the other day with baby. Eighteen months
ago baby was taken to see daddy, who had
left for the Front before it was bom ; and
the staggering news awaited the little
mother that her husband had been killed in
France on the eve of his furlough. Since
then she has been waiting to come home —
and incidentally storing up impressions of
England at War. There, as in Australia,
the big, easy money which is being made in
the munition and other industries seems to
this earnest woman to be blinding many
people to the horrors across the Channel.
The population is so great that the sorrow
of the individual is obscured. “I can’t
agree with those who say that Australia
shows no trace of the great tragedy. In the
faces of the people I see the war written
more clearly in Australia than in England,”
she says. “And far more busy fingers knit-
ting,” she adds.
When the Society
of Artists opens its
portals on December
I—said1 —said portals be-
ing approached by a
winding stair in
Queen Victoria Mar-
kets—the work of
W. Hardy Wilson
will attract lovers
of delicate coloring.
An architect by pro-
fession. this old
town by the sea is
Wilson’s birthplace;
but a seven years
visit to British and
other art Aleccas
moulded the taste
that flings a glamor
over early Sydnev
when he handles it. The future chronicler
of Australian history will find inspiration
from a tome, still in the making, of
Georgian architecture in N. S. Wales as
revealed by Hardy Wilson’s pencil sketches.
Governor Alacquarie left many fine bits of
early nineteenth-century masonry, and the
artist is giving the world a permanent record
of them, revelling in such old mansions as
Greystanes, at Prospect, and Newington,
near Parramatta. Here he is as his friend
George Lambert sketched him in 1908.
There was about 2|d. on the premises.
This was the first impression of the gather-
ing—heavily laden with brown-paper pack-
ages—that drifted in to the Alayor's room
to hear Airs. G. F. Abbott’s remarks. The
money came along later. James Burns, Dr.
Alackellar, Russell French, ex-Senator
AValker, Dugald Thomson and other clansmen
then gathered round the Alayor’s mahogany.
The small, tense woman, who is, with
vibrant eloquence, voicing the cause of the
Scottish AVomen’s Hospitals, means (acting
on advice) to hold back the collection-plate
till after November 30. Then, judging by
her backers, you’ll hear some heavy cheques
fall. She was almost submerged under a
big feather-trimmed hat till the time came
to talk about the heroism of the women who
have made hospitals out of shanties in
typhus-smitten Servia. Then a delicately-
featured face materialised under the milli-
nery, and a graphic story brought a sympa-
thetic sniff from the tender-hearted. I
believe the fair raider will remove £20,000
from Australia. She’s got a taking way
with her.
A very young citizen faded away last
week, when the Fiaschis’ infant daughter
Guilia died in a Sydney hospital. She was
born on the voyage between U.S.A. and our
side, and spent a brief three weeks m this
distracted planet.
There’s a home in Edgecliff-road, Louis
Henderson’s, where the second rap of 1 ate
upon the door has been heard within the
year. First, the eldest son was. killed in
France. Now a son-in-law, Flight-Lieut.
Gibbes, formerly of a station near Can-
berra, is reported missing on the Western
Front. His wife was the pretty Alarjone
Henderson of a few years ago. The Aus-
tralian flying-man was an electrical engi-
neer, with big American schemes in his mind
when the row began. Airs. Gibbes and a
small child are in England.
Brig.-General Jack Antill is on this side
again, after long service at the usual tryst.
He is in indifferent health, or was when he
left England.
Under this canopy
of feathers the
ostrich owes her
many a grudge—is
the winsome face of
Alary Alarlowe. The
Victorian girl I
fancy her name is
Shannon —after ab-
sence on the other
side, came back to
Australia in 1912
under engagement
with Bert Bailey.
She was cast for the
name-part in “The
Squatter’s Daughter”
—a role she filled in
her cradle. Even
droughts and lean
years have left her
with a comfy little income to silver-line her
globe-trotting. After leaving Australia
again, she was the heroine in a movie play
amongst the Canadian Rockies. A very
live bear in the cast chased Mary with unre-
hearsed vigor, and she cooled to the film
business. There’s a recent word from the
wanderer, who is now a Y.A. in an English
auxiliary Red Cross hospital. It’s on the
coast, and bombs fall bi-weekly. “But the
Boche hasn’t killed any of our wounded to
date,” she chirps. Her fresh outbreak, a
novel called “Kangaroos in King’s Land,”
has just been published by Simpkin
Marshall. In this tale Alary throws a kiss
to our own South Head Light, which sends
out a long, friendly finger to welcome home-
sick Australians.
Wesley College opens with thanksgiving
on December 1. Deputy-Gov. Cullen, as
Chancellor of the Uni. (the college is within
the ’Varsity), passes the key on to the
Methody Conference’s president; and Scott
Fletcher, recently of Brisbane, stays behind
to see that the young gentlemen attend to
their books.
Only a few friends watched the knot tied
in St. Paul’s, Chatswood, when Alollie
Black, a daughter of Reggie, AI.L.C., took a
plain gold ring from Lieut. Tom Nixson,
R.A.N. The sailor is a son of a late English
parson—of Cheshire, where the cheese and
cats come from.
Our Eastern Suburbs are buzzing with
the news of the engagement of Captain Jack
Goldie to Janet Yeomans, deftest of Red
Cross spinsters. The ’groom-elect is the
only son of that old Etonian and veteran
pedagogue Chas. J. I). Goldie, who has been
a master at Sydney Grammar for 38 years.
Jack was doing something in Fiji for the
Sugar Co. when the war began, and went
straight to the Cold Country, where he got
a commission and was sent to Salonika. He
has been wearing three stars for some time
past. It isn’t his first captaincy, for he was
head of the Sydney Grammar boat club a
few years ago, and later on stroked the
inter-State eight-oar crew for two years.
The Goldies are traditionally a rowing
family (do be careful how you pronounce
that adjective, my dear!) at Eton and Cam-
bridge : the Goldie boat-house, in which
Cambridge ’Varsity keeps its fleet of “light
ships,” was built and named in memory of
Captain Jack’s uncle. Just-retired Justice
A. H. Simpson, of the Equity Court—-also a
Cambridge man—is another uncle.
The bride-to-be is one of an old Sydney
family which divides its time between grow-
ing wool and chasing costs. Her father
(now deceased) was partner with his
brothers in Gilgoin station, out Brewarrina
way. Another uncle is a Sydney solicitor;
and a couple of dozen rowing and legal
Fitzhardinges are uncles and cousins. Jack
Goldie is now on the water, heading for this
country; and the cake will be cut shortly
after his arrival.
Airs. Hugh Ward is back in town, so the
rumors that the family were going to settle
in U.S.A., merely making trips this way, are
melting into air.
Nancy Chisholm, the youngest of the late
Arthur Chisholm’s five daughters, is engaged
to .Lieut. Ivan Young, of Yetholme station
(A ic.) and recently of the long, long Front.
I.lie Chisholms inherited a cosv income
apiece, and since the war they’ve done tv,-;,
toll of work. Nancy went off to Adelaide
a while ago to show the demure
all she knew about spinning. messes
11. H. Wallace, a nephew of Rose Spoh
has gone to ALL. with Cyril Maude’s co
lie continues with Grumpy in the coming
L.S. tour. Re Maude, an up-country youn»
ster (girl, of course) wrote to tell him she’d"
seen his play and liked it so much that
she hoped he’d come to , her wayback
town. “You could stay with us, dear Air
Maude, and the rest of the company could
stay with Aunt Margaret There’s a hall
in the town and I’m sure you could fill it!'’
The lied Crossers who are troubled about
many things are hoping for a good response
to a forthcoming carnival at Bathurst. It’s
to help the Western Home for Convalescent
Soldiers. The Continental begins on Novem-
ber 29 and finishes up December 1.
At the Cheer-o Girls’ brisk show in the
Repertory on Saturday night in aid of the
Animals’ Protection Society, caps worn
with frothy muslin gowns by the sweet-
sellers were dainty notions—puffs 0 f
whipped cream flecked with pink. The girls
have bettered their programme with a
Hawaiian song—supplied by Gertrude and
Beatrice Edmonds in bleached-grass drapery.
There’s a novel cake competition with
prizes up to £5. It’s for the A.S.C. Comforts
Fund and closes next Tuesday. ,309 George-
street for details.
Anita Onslow, another Sydneysider who
toils long hours for our boys, has turned her
attention for the time being to “Sammy,”
and is doing office-work for the new Ameri-
can Red Cross depot and club in Russell-
square or thereabouts.
There’s a cry from No. 7 Wynyard-street
Come and help us! It’s the Red Cross
fruit and cabbage depot, where the useful
green is handed out to the families of sick
and wounded soldiers. Your humblest
parsnip will be gratefully accepted.
The years roll past on velvet wings, and
young Noel Bridges, who left a billet in the
Alalay States to hurry to the Front, is now
a major with several “mentions”, in his
career. He is a son of the late General
Bridges.
Silk socks with elastic tops artfully
smothered in puckered ribbon are Auntie
Sam’s latest. Possibly the worthy matron
doesn’t wear them in public, but Aliss New
York is trying how they go with her short
skirts. The Australian skirt is descending
an inch or two. Hence the autumn winds
will hardly toss the hem higher than the silk
sock tops—if the frivolous half-hose does
come this way.
The last word about brainy Southern
singer Lucille Benstead, from the heart of
Australia, is that she’s back in London after
a big provincial tour.
There’s a recent photo of Dora Ohlfsen in
the picturesque white drapery of an Italian
Red Cross nurse. The Australian artist
went through the mill in a nurses’ training
school over there before binding up the
wounds of the brave men who are fighting
to save Italy from the barbarians.
In spite of war-time thrift (as practised
assiduously and almost exclusively by those
whom long use has made adepts in the art),
the dressmakers are very busy for Christmas.
Women who suddenly feel as if they de-
served a new frock complain that there’s
“not a soul to touch the stuff till after the
New Year.”
How d’you like the jumper blouse now
it’s held in place at the waist with threaded
ribbon? The clothes-prop figure has it all
the time in these overall duds, but I hare
seen the plump lady achieve a triumph in
the belted affair. It’s a blessing the sack-
cloth, “All is Lost” brigade don’t rule the
roost, anyhow. Put 15st. of feminine charms
in a sugar-bag tied round the middle with
a clothes-line, and I can’t imagine it feeling
any better equipped for turning the heel of
a sock.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

his favorite steed.

My Dear Yarrie.—
At the consecration of the Horsfall
Memorial Chapel, in Trinity, the donor’s
young widow sat in the transept—a vision in
a big black haf, with rare filmy laces at the
leek of her trim tailorings. Two nieces, the
Blairs, were in the choir with rows of sweet
girl-graduates in full panonly and headed
by Sugden, who looked like an overgrown
cherubic choir-boy in his purple and crimson
satin gown. Warden Deeper stood in magni-
ficence and pink-trimmed crimson. The
Archbishop got a real stage effect when his
cardinal robes swept down over the marble
steps of the altar. ’Varsity importants were
crowded into the big Gothic chapel.
The young widow Carse, just returned
sadly from England, was in the choir.
Gran’ma Carse, in deep mourning, was one
of the congregation. Mrs. Carty Salmon
occupied a seat of honor, for her late hus-
band was a distinguished Trinity man as
well as chairman of the Council and a
trustee of the College. After the long church
service the released company strolled over
to Trinity to sip afternoon-tea and listen to
Warden Leeper return thanks for the dead
benefactor’s gift.
The Carty Salmon widow is drooping
round town in very sable weeds and complet-
ing necessary legal business. She is going to
“place” her boys for the long Christmas
vacation and then get back to her beloved
Sydney for a rest.
Mrs. Burt (here for the races from
Westralia) is finishing her holiday by going
into a hospital for some patching. The
invalid was once Miss Roberts and a Mel-
bourne beauty.
The Gordon girls from Sydney are visit-
ing Auntie Dick Horsfall, at Orrong,
Toorak (Mrs. Dick was a Fosbery, same as
their mother) ; but when they are extra
rushed socially they put in a spell at
Menzies’. They had a Savoy supper-party
last week with 60 young-men guests and 40
girls, so the fox-trotting never flagged.
Mrs. Fan Dango Mackay will climb
s board the transcontinental next week. She
goes to Westralia on the heels of hubby.
The Malvern Ladies’ Rifle Club had a
great party at the Quamby in order to hand
over a wedding present to one of their crack
shots, Edith Hope Campbell—she really
originated the Club, too. In the absence of
the Forrest dame (president), Mrs. Rogers
Thompson handed the complimentary speech
and the silver salver.
The W. J. T. Clarke matron lightened
the social gloom last Tuesday evening by
hostessing a dinner and Tom Noddy frivol
for daughters Roma and Nesta. Gambling
games seem to be the prevailing craze. Sas-
siety will yet be found killing time and bank
accounts with two-up.
Handsome Pauline Curran, who came
here from the Speck with her mother for
the Cup diversions, hostessed a gay two-
step at the Savoy on Monday evening. There
are still a few civilian dancing men of sorts
to be found, if you know where to look for
them.
Howard Berry presided over a meeting
of gentlemen of substance at Scott’s on Fri-
day, called to consider ways and means of
recognising ex-Gaud Mayor Ilennessy’s ser-
vices to the Empire and the World. It was
decided to have him preserved in oils in the
Town Hall.
Freda Sternberg, Melba’s stylish young
secretary for 12 months past, is packing up
her fountain-pen and powder-puff and label-
ling them U.S.A.
Guido Baracclii. who was lately lime-
lighted by the Uni. authorities and the
Argus for laying bare his anti-fighting soul
in the Shop’s highly-proper monthly maga-
zine. is nowadays platforming in opposition
to the Conscription proposals. On the soap-
box Guido appears as a cultured young
man with a clear and “superior” voice, given
to speaking his mind in the language of the
best writers. But I’m afraid he arouses
about as much enthusiasm as a cold potato
does in the soul of a washlady.
There is to be an outburst of “Pinafore”
at the Naval College before the place
empties for the Christmas holidays. Little
Buttercup and all the sisters, .cousins and
aunts will be joyous young males in skirts.
"Scott’s” was drawn into the Lucky Bag
whirl last week. The big hotel which is
Man’s last stronghold has rarely had such
an invasion of women. Manager Wilson
gave them all a hearty welcome, and Sas-
siety came in and drank tea for the good
of the cause. There was a fine programme
of music, and a few heroes ventured into the
gale of afternoon gossip. Squatter Robertson
handed over a fiver to the secretary and
then fled. Ralph Falkiner was the only
man at his wife’s table, and he gave bak-
sheesh to all the sweets girls. Mrs. Carlyle
Smythe, Mrs. Pohlman and Mrs. Gabb had
tables. Mrs. Gillespie and the Hidgcock
girls hostessed together. Mrs. Johnnie
Fuller blew in after driving loads of re-
turned soldiers from a homecoming ship, and
had tea with Mrs. Barry Thompson. Miss
Butler George and Mrs. Tawse had another
corner. Mrs. Jack Sternberg was helping.
A covey of feathered and silk-clad women
fluttered round the sacred smoking-room and
lounge until well into dinner-time, when the
men inmates were looking hopelessly dis-
tressed.
Squatter Horsfall left something like
£20,000 for a memorial hall at the Uni., and
invitations were lately sent out in handfuls
for the opening ceremonies. The benefactor’s
young widow received one of the cards and
read with interest the caution attached:
"Please send acceptance at once, as the seat-
ing accommodation is most limited.”
A cousin of King George's, the Hon. Mrs.
Edwardes, whose daughter is the Countess
Gleichen, a well-known sculptress, runs a
cheery club in London for overseas officers.
Here Australians, Maorilanders, Canadians
and S’Africans mingle. Occasionally Royalty
drops in, and when other entertainment is
wanted, Rosina Phillipi, Irene Browne, Pollie
Emery and Ivy Shilling supply it.
A cooee from the Holy Land says that
Major Reg Franklin has won the D.S.O.
Reg, who got away with the first lot of
Bananaland Light Horse, is brother of Mel-
bourne Grammar headmaster, who has just
changed a sergeant’s stripes for a gunnery
lieutenant’s stars, but hasn’t made a move
to the Front yet. Still another Franklin
wears the blue and brass-buttons of a Naval
College instructor.
From “Rosna” in London :— ■
Sergt. Penleigh Boyd, who dropped his paint-brush
to join up with the Australians, was gassed the other
day and is now in the Australian hospital at South-
all. It is probable the Flying Corps will seize him
on his recovery, delicate artist hands being much
in demand in that quarter. His younger brother
Martin, who had a commission in the Buffs, has
returned from France to join the R.F.C.
Flying-man Captain Ashcroft has gone
over to Sydney on a military job. The much-
wounded aviator (he was badly smashed
twice) is anxious to get back to active ser-
vice, and is living the simple life to hasten
the glad day. He is particularly interested
in extending aviation to North Australia.
The Hilda Murray Jones girl has been
looking pale and anxious ever since fianc6
Major Gregor Knox was reported “severely
wounded.” His injured leg has since been
amputated. Now comes a cheering message
from England that a bar has been added to
the Major’s Military Cross. The disabled
hero is coming back to Australia directly.
Colonel Charles Mason, son of the late
Speaker, now wears the D.S.O. Justice
Hodges is beaming. Charley was his asso-
ciate before the war.
The best-fed Anglo-Australians are finding
life intolerably dull since the war regulations
stopped private motor-cars for weeks on
end. Sweet girl shovers who used to take
Billjims for country airings moan in draw-
ing-rooms, and denounce the other absurd
regulation which forbids invalid officers to
be out after 6 p.m. without a guardian.
To tell the truth this beastly war is ceasing
to be an entertainment.
Prosaic Barker’s-road forms part of the
boundary between Kew and Hawthorn, "and
in the little gardens, so green and grave and
still, many shadows walk to and fro.” On
one side is Xavier .College, whence young
Peter Lalor went to join the Foreign Legion
and afterwards the Billjim battalion in whose
service he lost his life, after killing seven
Turks on Sari Bair. Many another Xavier has
followed him, and many still survive, among
them Lt.-Col. Harold Cohen, of the Artillery.
Nearly opposite is the house where lived
Lance-corporal W. A. Tourrier. a machine-
gunner who won the Military Medal at
Bullecourt. Further along is the lawn on
which once sat dark-haired Gladys Taylor,
telling a merry circle of her adventures in the
mazes of the law. She afterwards married
Captain Rex Ilain, and dropped her legal
practice to go to Blighty and write "The
Coo-ee Contingent,” in which she included
some of the stories of brother-in-law Captain
Percy On the same side of the street
is a house of mourning, to which the news
has just come of the death in action of its
kindly head. Major W. A. Adams, D. 5.0., of
the 3rd Pioneers. He used to be with the
Austral Otis, and his son Norman —one of
five children —is still at the Front.
Noel, eldest boy of Col. Cox Taylor, left
lately for Somewhere. There were three
generations of his family in soldiers’ colors
before this fine youngster left. His father,
the colonel, is in charge of the Artillery
&mp at Liverpool. His grandfather, Colonel
Spalding—an old Permanent gunner in N. S.
Wales before Federation—is spending his
Imperial pension on the N. S. Wales North
Coast and whipping-up recruits. His father,
by the way, was a greater colonel still. The
straight, sturdy young who left
the other day had made a fair start with
two stripes on his sleeve.
Miss Adelaide’s confidences
Their Exes, have taken a house at Victor Harbor
for the summer months. Mid-December will find
them on the wallaby.
Clubdom and the Bar turned up in force at the
Queen’s Hall on Saturday night, when the Repertory
Theatre staged Alec Melrose’s “Adventures of an
Adventuress.” The author, who is one of the squat-
ting Melroses, though he has chosen the law as a
profession, was billed as “Alec Sommerville,” but
no one was much surprised when shouts for “author”
brought Melrose on the stage. The Galways, who
always take a kindly interest in Repertory work,
were in the front pews.
Capt. Gordon Campbell, who won the M.C. about
a year ago, has had a bar attached to it.
The estate of the late jeweller J. M. Wendt, one
of our ancient institutions, panned out at £33,500.
Cheerful news comes from the Rosman family in
London, where Mrs. Bowyer-Rosman’s book of verses
has won criticisms that have delighted her. Lady
Eardley Wilmot, who has illustrated editions de luxe
of Omar, “The Light of Asia” and other classics, was
so much struck With Mrs. Rosman’s effort that she
has asked the publishers to let her illustrate a new
edition. Meanwhile, Alice Grant Rosman, who is
dividing her time between writing and doing all
sorts of practical jobs for Billjim, has had great
success with “Tower Wall,” her latest novel.
On Wednesday night at the Cheer-Up Hut Surgeon-
Captain Duguid, just back from Palestine, where he
was with the mounted units in the desert, yarned as
freely as the censorship would permit of their pluck
and their achievements and of his unbounded admi-
ration for the men. He spoke with a simple sincerity
that gave every word weight, and those present felt
that, albeit innocently, they had done very scant
justice to the Australians in the Holy Land. The
lecture is to be repeated in the Town Hall.
Some weeks ago the Australian Trained Nurses’
Association decided that £3 3s. a week would be
an improvement on £2 25., the rate then ruling, and
the Royal British Nurses’ Association will probably
make a move to the same end. Seeing that £3 3s.
is the fee in N. S. Wales, we don’t see why it should
be only £2 2s. here. Do you?
Florence Fitz Gerald, who in private life is Mrs.
Follen Bishop, has transferred that gorgeous pest
Salvation Jane to canvas with remarkable success.
I suppose you know that Jane is the flower-smothered
weed that comes in the spring-time to fling a blue
carpet across the landscape amidst the loud applause
(or something) of the cocky.
The William Smith widow signals from
England that Lorna, the younger girl, is
about to say “I will” to Captain Fender. No
particulars as to the captain’s nationality
or front name. The elder Smith daughter is
booked for matrimony with Major Dease, an
Irishman who left Australia to get into
khaki.
Lately one of Melbourne’s well-provided-
for Utopians, after distinguishing himself in
a small way as a cultured platform advocate
of less work and more afternoons off, became
engaged to dashing damsel with a nice
taste in glad rags. Presently the uplifter
decided, in spite of his comparative affluence,
to share the labors of the toiling masses, and
to that end sought a job in a factory. In
the intervals of his pilgrimages he had
several heart-to-heart talks with his love as
to their future together, which was to be
located in a humble cottage and no washing
given out. The lady soon settled the matter
tor herself, hot suds and the frying-pan
making no appeal to her. The little grey
home in Collingwood has faded right out of
the picture, the engagement is disengaged,
and the devoted friend of the downtrodden
goes excelsioring on his wealthy lonesome.
Kathleen, daughter of the Burnewang
Hunters, has just said “Yes” to Flight-Lieut.
W atson. Kathleen is the third of three
pietty sisters to venture into matrimony.
Dorothy, the eldest, set the good example
by marrying well-known Jack Dane, and
now keeps house in London. Caroline, the
beauty, is now Mrs. Goldie, and presides
over a station home in the Western District.
Edith Hope Campbell is to marry
widowed squatter Roland Graham, on
December o, at St. George’s. Toorak. One
t, , the , Hope Campbell brothers married a
Graham sister, so the clans will be
well united. Squatter Graham’s first wife
was one of the lovely Affleck girls. She died
many years ago.
Titian-haired Molly Carew, the merry
joung songs-at-the-pianist who had her
musical education at the Uni. Conserva-
tonum is now the mother of a British maid

Rumors reach the outside world that tenor
Walter Ivirby is recovering from his anp en

the Christian Year bound in leather. f
Doloies harl her big patriotic concert on
Saturday night There was great enthusiasm
all through, and the sweet singer was given
a thunderous welcome back to the platform
after her long absence. A huge Australian
flag was handed up to her, with French and
Italian colors in ribbon streamers. Dimples
held it as she sang, though it was several
feet higher than herself. The white-robed
Philharmonics helped with songbursts from
the organ seats. Dolores wore diamonds
with a pink gown, the short skirt of which
was turned in at the hem in the fashionable
Pierrette style and showed very trim tiny
pink-shod feet and ankles.
Melba writes from Yankeeland that she
has met the Belgian pianist in Chicago. The
diva is exultant because America has recog-
nised the talent which appealed to her even
before she took the young Belgian home to
Coornbe Cottage to feed him up. In the
same letter she tells of much work done by
herself and Lady Susan while they were in
Canada on the way from Australia.
Ted Dyson is going about nowadays try-
ing hard not to look too consciously meritori-
ous, for unto him a daughter has been given
-—the most wonderful infant that has ever
blessed the home of an Australian poet since
Arthur Adams’s youngster made its first
public appearance. It is related that the
day after its birth the Dyson infant, left
alone for a few seconds, made a desperate
effort to gain possession of a fountain-pen
and a sheet of copy-paper.
Billy Greene, now starring in “You’re in
Love,” has turned down an American
engagement and made a new contract with
J.C.W. He and his pretty ginger-haired
missus have picked out a Frankston farmlet
for spare time and week-ends.
Ruby Hooper, a pretty flapper with a
turn for stage compositions, gave a new in-
spiration to the suburban world last week.
It was an extravaganza labelled “The Golden
Butterfly,” and fluttered through its copy-
right performance at the St. Kilda Town
Hall in aid of the Purple Cross. Ruby is a
great horsewoman as well as a good stage-
manager and a very live organiser.
In fiction it is always the stage-struck
Adolphus or the designing Hoggenheimer who
sends offerings to the goddess ; in fact, it is
mostly another woman. She pays the com-
pliment anonymously, perhaps, even though
she sends a little note with it. Sometimes
a costly gift comes without a w T ord. When
Dorothy Gumming played Lady Teazle in
.Sydney she carried, on the first night, a fan
of no importance. Next day somebody sent
her a lovely old fan, wrapped in venerable
paper, from which she guessed that the kindly
donor was probably an old lady who thought
that such a fan was just what Lady Teazle
ought to hide her blushes with. But the
actress doesn’t know whom to thank.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

“Snell”: A blind man who for several
years earned his living in Melbourne streets by making
unrecognisable remarks on the middle string of a
hump-backed violin, and was always attended by a
cattle-dog named John, regained his sight some time
back and is now endowed with almost normal
vision, and can go about his business as a builder
of brooms and feather-dusters without any assist-
ance, much to the dog’s disgust. But John refuses
to abandon his guardianship, and if his owner goes
abroad without him raises such a hullabaloo that
the family is forced to liberate him to save the peace
of the district. In the early days of Blank’s delivery
from darkness, John had the most harrowing time.
He could not understand Blank’s recklessness at
crossings, and pranced about him in a state of con-
sternation, flying at horses, holding up cars, and
playing the deuce with traffic and law and order.
He carried his leading strap to Blank every morning
at the accustomed hour, and will probably never get
over the idea that Blank’s failure to make use of his
services is the result of a dangerous dementia that
calls for careful watching. The other day Blank,
having met an old friend, betook himself to a
Swanston-street bar, and there lingered over pleasur-
able recollections. John lost patience after the
first quarter of an hour; in 20 minutes he began to
play up, and insist on assuming possession of his
charge. Then he disappeared—to reappear later on,
lame and dusty. Ranging up he thrust something
into Blank’s hand. It was his old harness and the
leading-strap. “I humored him,” says the ex-blind
man: “I put the harness on and let him take me
home. Perhaps by this time he was quite right in
his surmise. Nowadays if Ido get a little bit
blind once in a way, it is only to make the old dog
happy!”
* * * *
“Azack”: Kindly advise “O’Regan” (B.
8/11/’l7), who asked if swinging a dog around by
the back legs will cure it when poisoned, that that
is only half the cure. Before stalking the merry-go-
round, give the hound a bellyful of salt. This can
best be done by filling the animal’s mouth, and then
forcing the jaws shut and holding them so for a few
minutes. Three or four such mouthfuls will do the
trick. Then take hold of the legs that support the
tail and let her go. If the patient dies after this
treatment it will be from old age.
“B.B.” : A man told a Maoriland military
service board at Hamilton in the North Island that
he and his wife milked 109 cows between them. On
one occasion she met with an accident, breaking a
rib and a bone in her wrist, but at four o’clock next
morning she was at her place in the shed. There are
worse jobs than going to war.
“Gerald Sinclair” : The recent fairly strong
earthquake at Wellington (M.L.) revived memories
of mv youth in the Shaky Isles. As youngsters we
were taught that on the arrival of the oscillation
one of us must grab hold of the kerosene-lamp
whilst another promptly opened the door. Latter
edict was a relic of the days of mud habitations,
when the doors frequently jambed.
The biggest shake of my experi-
ence was at Wellington in August,
1904. One who saw the movement
from a hillside described its effect
as resembling an advancing wave
of the sea. I was working for a
hardware firm which carried a
particularly heavy stock upstairs,
and we abruptly sought fresh-air.
Only one man stayed in the
building, and he did it because
the tvpiste hung round his neck.
But Wellington forgets, and each
year taller stone edifices are built
despite the experience of ’Frisco
and Messina, where only ferro-
concrete stood the test; forget-
ting, also, the ’quake of the
’fifties, which raised part of Te
An> flat sft., and disregarding the
standing warning near the entrance to her own
harbor, where exist some four earthquake-raised
beaches, each about 9ft. above the other.
“Pick” : A dainty nest is that of the little
hooded robin among the scrub pines. The tenement,
usually in the hollow of a tree, is a marvellous imi-
tation of a small basin, and measurements of a
number will reveal no variation in depth or diam-
eter. The walls are of thin strips of colored bark
interwoven with moss, and the whole is smoothlv
bound and rounded off with spider’s-web. In this
symmetrical edifice the drab henbird attends to her
three apple-green eggs, whilst her gaily-ornamented
mate serves up the dishes of fruit- and vegetable-
destroying beetles.
“Mrs. Lance Rawson”: When living 25
miles the other side of Nowhere, one of my young-
sters cut his foot very badly and was bleedin°-
severely. I was muddling along in a funk when Old
Kitty blew in. “Alrigh’, alrigh' ; mine get it,” she
exclaimed. She returned in a few minutes with a
handful of young eucalyptus leaves, which she chewed
up and spat into a saucer. When she’d a good quan-
tity she plastered the poultice on to the cut, and the
bleeding stopped at once. In a few days the wound
was healed. I have seen this done many times by
the blacks, and I never knew inflammation to result.
There is wonderful virtue in eucalyptus leaves, and all
bush mothers should know it. A good bunch bruised
and put into the baby’s hot bath will make him sleep
when he is restless or cross, and may save him and
the old man from convulsions.
DONE BY ONE OF THE OLD MASTERS.
THE ARTIST: “I believe you cut my hair last time?”
THE BARBER : Don t think so, sir—only been here twelve months."
“Nonp.”: Recent remarks by “D.D.” and
“Yalgun” re black people turning white remind
me of a strange trick of Nature’s. A woman in
the U.S.A. married a full-blooded negro. They had
no children. He died and she married again, this
time a pure-blooded white. They had two children
and although they were white they had most pro-
nounced negro features—high cheekbones, thick lips,
broad nose, etc. Her black husband had been dead
! three years!
“5.0. H.”: So far as I have met them, the
various native tribes of Westralia show preference
for the foreign nig. If an American darky hits a
camp he is made a guest of honor. He gets a mia
to himself, and is allowed to have any gin he may
choose for a wife. Yet if you take a De Grey nigger
into the country of the other tribes he must be kept
close to a white man, or he’s dead-meat. In an over-
landing party a couple of years ago we had an Ash-
burton native with us. One of the horses couldn’t
be found with the rest one morning, and as there
was a mob close behind us we decided to push on to
the next well and send the blaekboy back next day to
find her. The boy started off at daybreak with strict
instructions not to go into any of the Gascoyne
niggers’ camps. He did not return that night, so we
guessed what had happened. The boss gave me a
rifle and sent me back to pick him up. I found the
boy in a camp, but laid out stiff. I examined him
all over, but couldn’t find a mark on .him. It is my
opinion he was smothered, or else poisoned. Of
course, none of them were guilty, and I hadn't
enough bullets to aerate the lot, so I left orders for
them to come up for sentence on the Day of Judg-
ment.
“John Quill”: No need to shoot a dog
when he has picked up a bait. A handful of tobacco
or salt thrown down his throat, or a strong drink of
mustard and water, will fix him. I have always found
that a lump of bluestone forced down a dog’s throat is
reliable, but as it is exceedingly caustic care should
be taken not to use too much. A fragment the
size of a pea is sufficient.
“Beargrass”: An oldest inhabitant of the
writer’s youthful acquaintance was wont to main-
tain loudly thai the popular derivation of the name
of the Yarra *it is supposed to be the aboriginal
word for water, duplicated to describe much water —
was all nonsense. His story was that Batman,
when asking the native name of the river, pointed,
as the aboriginals thought, to a prominent tree on
the bank. This was of a species well known to
them, being the manna-tree, of which the dried
sweet secretion formed a favorite article of sum-’
mer diet in the best aboriginal circles, and of
which the native name, according to him, was
yarra-yarra.
“Mellish Reef”: After a lot of careful
observation of the flying-fish, my testimony is that
very frequently, when rising out of the water, the
fish uses his wings to steady himself and also to gain
momentum ; but once that is attained he uses them
monoplane fashion. I have been a “flying-fish
sailor” (a tropical waters man) for a good few years
now, but cannot equal “Lance Jack” (B. 18/10/T7)
*dth his “300 yards and more” in a flight. The fish
often alight on the decks, particularly at night-time,
and in doing so sometimes smash their heads in
against the deckhouses. The lights seem to have an
attraction for them. The flesh makes very fine eat-
ing, the taste somewhat between whiting and garfish.
JUST VENGEANCE.
“Jack says he's been cooking for some Ger-
man prisoners.”
“Good enough for the cows —they deserve
it!”
“Sarto”: Beware the onion weed, which
has sprung up in the highways and byways, in the
lanes and fields, and is choking anything that falls
among it. In some parts of Southern Riverina I
have seen it growing so thick that, from a distance,
it looked like a well-kept lawn. Cattle won't eat it:
it’s so tough that they can’t bite it through. It’s hard
to cut, even with a hoe. It has a small, star-shaped
pink flower. What part of Sheol did it spring from.'

NOON ON THE BARRIER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The saltbush steeped in drowsy stillness lies,
The mulga seems to swoon,
A hawk hangs poised within the burning skies,
And it is noon.
The river-gums, their leaf-pores closed, distil
No fresh and cooling breath;
I stand upon an old, hard-bitten hill,
Wide plains beneath.
Here stood tall mountains when the world was
young,
Their peaks uplifted high;
Here was the song of many waters sung
In days gone by.
The monarch Change, whose will no power witn-
stands,
Vast lord of might,
At work by night and day with tirelesss hands,
Planed down their height.
With such to see, and seeing ponder on,
Such mighty ruin wrought,
Why should we wonder at proud Babylon
Brought down to nought?
Be not amazed though princes be displaced
And kingdoms overcast;
Are empires more than mountains, basalt-based,
That they should last?
A sense of things unreal, seen in dream,
Is over plain and heights—
The time-worn rocks, the crumbled earth, the gleam
Of mirage lights;
The horseman riding with a slackened rein
Alone, a silent man;
The weird dust-sprites that whirl across the plain
A little span;
The earth-hued lizard, on the sun-baked rock
Stretched out in stirless sleep;
The far-off drover and his dusty flock
Of travelling sheep ;
The hidden birds that break the hush, and call,
And sink again to rest,
The dust-storm, hanging, like a crimson shawl,
Within the west;
The white quartz glittering on the umber track,
The claypans, cracked and bare;
The poised hawk, hanging, like a menace black,
In middle air;
EVEN IN HIS DREAMS.
PHOTOGRAPHER: “How about taking a photo,
of your team, mate?”
BULLOCKY: “I see enough of the cows with-
out lookin' at pictures of 'em!”
The wonder pf the spacious plain and sky,
The splendor of it all:
The all that is not I —so wide, so high—•
And I so small!
The sun swings on, and up the western verge
The great shawl-cloud spreads wide,
Till sky and plain in oneness meet and merge,
Fierce lit, red-dyed.
A wind, hell-hot and surged with fury, whips
The trees upon its path,
And all is sudden turmoil and eclipse,
And cries of wrath.
A choking darkness draws across the sun
And clouds his splendor o’er,
And though but half his pilgrimage be done,
’Tis noon no more.

“Pick”: During last summer and early
autumn many broods of starlings were reared under
the roof-tree and eaves of my shack. I spent much
time watching their foraging parties unload botflies,
blowflies, grasshoppers and caterpillars into the
yawning cavities of the offspring, and decided that
at last I had discovered a wild-bird importation that
wasn’t a nark. Just about then myriads of reddish-
grey lice, so diminutive that they were almost un-
diseeraed individually, invaded everything from
wardrobe to tucker-bag in the camp. I traced these
pests back to the nesting area, and thereupon
promptly issued notices to the starlings to quit.
Being met with persistent refusals I outed the whole
alien settlement with the fumes of burning sulphurj

“Galaxis”: There is nothing novel about
the man who suckled an infant (B. 8/11/T7). About
2 per cent, of men have relatively well-developed
mammary glands which only need a stimulus to
bring them into activity. Gould’s “Curiosities of
Medicine” records a number of authoritative cases.
Cancer of the breast is not very infrequent amongst
men.
* * * *
“Te Whare”: Black brother was by no
means a bad surgeon in his primitive way. In the
case of a badly-crushed arm he would swathe it in
bandages of tea-tree bark kept constantly moist with
cold water, and confine the patient’s diet to the
pounded root of the edible fern, i.e., bracken. This
was done on one occasion after a European medico
had urged immediate amputation. The sufferer
recovered. For dysentery, fomentations and infusions
prepared from the leaves of the native currant and
certain other plants were used, while ulcers were
sprinkled with alkaline-wood ashes. Snakebites were
treated by ligature and sucking, and the poisoned
party sometimes stood in cold water, so that the blood
might chill and prevent quick circulation of the
venom. Rheumatism was treated by shampooing and
bleeding the affected part, while wounds were plas-
tered with mud and ashes, or, if septic, cauterised
with a firestiek.
ALL DWESSED UP.
BACKBLOX : “ Blimey, why all the glory?"
VISITING ENGLISH COUSIN: “Don’t you werhembah? You awsked me to help you kill a
few wabbits and advised me to dwess suitably."
ON HIS DIGNITY.
MR. BENJAMINS (to prospective borrower) : “If I vos to sharge you twenty-five per
shent — vy, ye’d call me a shark, vouldn't you? Veil, I vouldn’t like it; so I
sharges yeh seventy-five, an’ den yeh can call me a t’ief, if yeh likes.”
“Ornis”: “Myall” (B. 1/11/T7) is not
the only one to be puzzled why the yellow-tail builds
a top storey to its shack. Every birdologist from
Gould down has had a shot at explaining the curi-
osity, and many and varied have been the theories.
The most generally accepted is that it serves as a
roosting-place for hubby when he arrives home and
doesn’t wish to disturb his better half as she sits
on her eggs. Another theory is that it serves as a
blind to enemies, such as the cuckoos, who finding
a seemingly empty nest call elsewhere. I have
found tits’ nests with a cuckoo’s egg in the “cock
roost.” A third guess is that it serves as a shelter
for the young when grown too big for the nest
proper, but not old enough to shift for themselves. I
can’t see any reason why the three surmises should
not dove-tail one into the other—a blind to enemies,
a shelter for the old man, and a refuge for the kids.
“Wandi” : A sly and active little poultry
thief is the bushy-tailed rat, or brush-tailed pouched
mouse. It is smaller than the native eat and hard
to see at night as it crouches in a low fork or lies
lengthways on a limb. The body is grey, the tail
long, black and bushy. It is more productive than
the native cat, having half a dozen, sometimes as
many as eight, to a litter, which are carried for a
brief period in the pouch. It nests in small hol-
lows, preferably in low spouts. Though small, this
nimble creature can wrestle with the biggest hen on
the roost. It seizes the victim by the neck, just
behind the head, and retains its grip in the inevit-
able tumble from the perch and the subsequent
violent struggle on the ground. Its smallness and
smartness make it the hardest of all nocturnal
raiders to get under a vengeful waddy.
‘‘John Quill”: “E. 8.” (B. 8/11/T7) may
distinguish Mr. Magpie from his wife by the plumage.
The former’s is generally the brighter; the female’s
a duller or a dirtier color.
* * * *
“Cave Man”: A theory held by a great
many bushmen is that the female white rabbit
(albino) will not breed. To-day, a persistent bloke
poked one out of a hollow log. She was suckling
one litter and making preparations for the
arrival of another. As she was a genuine albino,
this old myth can now range up alongside the one
about the birth of the kangaroo.
* * * *
“Birregurra”: Here’s my dozen for the
beauteous-bird competition: Regent honev-eater, with
his richly-contrasted' black and gold; the now rare
pink cockatoo, a glory of rose-pink, white and crim-
son , the dainty Australian bee-eater, or rainbow
bird ; the well-known king parrot; the blue-bellied
or Blue Mountain, lorikeet; the saucy blue wren;
the yellow shrike-tit, with the double attraction of
bright yellow breast and rakish black and white
crest; the black-shouldered kite, possessing dozens of
shades of delicate greys and blacks; and the spine-
tailed swift, of sombre beauty, with browns, greens
and white. The Australian roller, white crane and
spotted-diamond bird are the last, but by no means
the tail end, of this brilliant bevy of Australians.
The courtesies of the Bush. From Wagga
(N.S.W.) Advertiser:—
Notice.— Mr. P. R. Higgins having declared that
in future he will ignore me, I have decided to sever
my connection with Wagga, as life without Higgins
would be like love without a woman.— Alice Smith.

Silas Snell”: Concerning the curiosities
of bush courtships, I have the case of Sam and
Louise, also Andy, to bring into view. Louise was
a general at Mahon’s, with a better complexion
than you’d expect. Think of everything that can be
done about a farm, and Louise did it. She also
kept Mahon’s accounts and cut the family hair. Sam’s
old man owned an adjacent farm of 700 acres;
Andy was a sort of under-manager at John Sitson’s’,
who topped-off cattle for the Melbourne market.
Sam had been drifting about Mahon’s for a long time
offering furtive, half-hearted attentions to the maid’
Andy had lurched in occasionally an .i , ,
things, offering Louise diffident admiration^ ° n
tance. One Sunday afternoon Sam Svef
m the orchard, with nothing to do for t-u Louise
but work a hand spray, and he got down fn
“Look ’ere, Loo,” he said, “dyeh happen t’^T®'
get married?” Louise blushed and mLed f
tree. “Oh, I dunno,” she said, with, SPP ' e
that brought the spray to play on Sam.L’»
e.v, S™ took hold, ~,,1 .«°.eL the ”
orchard generally.’ “Say if you do or y OU ‘ dn
he insisted. Louise wriggled, and the spray refrl’
Sam again. “Oh, I dunno,” she replied coqueS,
What if I do?” “Well, if yeh do dead ho?!’
Andy Brown’s willin’. lie’ll take yeh anv
Louise drew off with great hauteur and worked d.
spray with perfect precision. “Don’t «
Brown,” she said. “Wouldn’t have him if 1/!?
loaded down.” Sam scratched his head “Sur 8
won’t have him ?” he continued. “lie’s ' eot . Z
good billet with Sitson, five quid a week V
Mind; what yer doin’, chuckin’ away a chance ike
that. I won’t have him.” “There’s no ’urrv-!
Andy’ll wait.” “Not in a thousan’ years, I won’t”
“Oh, very well, if you won’t you won’t,'” he said
“Now, then, what about me? Will yeh have me
Lo° ?” Sam got the spray in his left eye this time’
....When dates and other preliminaries were settled
said Louise: “What did yeh want me to marrv Andv
Brown for when you was after me yourself’” “Well”
he said, “Brown was willin’ to give ten quid if’i
could get you to marry him, and I thought I’d have
a try for the money first.”
* * * *
“D.F.”; Some of the old hands used the
leaves of the tea-tree for something else than making
tea. In Tasmania old-time shepherds and bush-
whackers used occasionally to smoke the leaves when
they ran out of baccy. Talking about tea, some of
those who have used the seeds of the kurrajong
roasted and crushed, in place of coffee say that they
are not at all a bad substitute.
* * * *
“H.V.E.”: The azure kingfisher which
nests in tunnels in the banks of rivers, ponds and
estuaries appears to resort to the same spot year
after year. This September I found four tunnels
within an area of about four square yards of bank.
On probing one with a light twig the dapper little
proprietor sturried out in great consternation. The
four pearl-white, glossy eggs are laid in a hollow at
the end of the tunnel, which penetrates into the
bank for about 18in. This primitive incubator is
sometimes lined with fish-scales. It is not wise to
thrust a hand in, for brother black-snake sometimes
enters these places, scoffs the eggs or nestlings, and
then coils there for a snooze, with his business end
outwards. This beautifully-colored kingfisher, with
dark-blue coat and orange vest, is (or was) not
uncommon about Middle Harbor (N.S.W.), and was
figured and described by Lewin in his “Birds of New
South Wales” over 80 years ago. The bird shoots
through the air with outstretched beak when in quest
of fish fry, in the semblance of an aerial torpedo.
A GOOD UNIONIST.
THE VALIANT TALKER : “Got a crutch, I
see! Wounded?”
BILLJIM (wearily): “No. Just left it to you
and Billy Hughes. When I saw the re-
sult of the elections — well, I said, ‘I’ve
never done a man out of a job, so if
this one belongs to him and Hughes,
they can ’ave it. I’m off home.’”
“Yarrum” : Here-is a sure cure for dogs
affected by ticks. Boil the common fern (bracken
will do), and give the sufferer a little of the liquid
a couple of times a day. I’ve won with it scores of
times. I got the cure from a blackfellow.
PROVISION FOR THE FUTURE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Her name was Kate. She was a dame
Of two-score years and four;
She’d wed and doused a feeble flame
When hardly yet a score.
At thirty she had buried two,
At forty she’d a hubby new,
And there were hopes of still a few.
When Danny’s hut took fire at night,
Kate rushed to lend a hand.
She strove with Amazonian might;
Then, given to understand
That Dan was in his bedroom shut,
She soused herself well in the butt,
And rushed within the flaming hut.
She brought him forth, all singed and black,
And bore him home, and then
She nobly nursed the settler back
To health and strength again.
“Men’s scarce,” she said, disclaiming praise ;
“I may be wantin’, if you plaze,
Another, wan of these fine days.”

“Melb”: Bert Bailey is announced as
Dame in the King’s pantomime. I do not
recall another Australian Dame, except
Martyn llagan, once Greville, who had the
job in Marcus Clarke’s only panto., “Goody
Two Shoes and Boy Blue.” After swigging
ar a bottle. Dame Hagan exclaimed, "Oh,
dear, I’m getting the Delicious Trembles!”’
Friend in the dress-circle to Clarke: “How-
ever can you write such rubbish?” Clarke:
“Don’t ask me ! My dialogue has vanished.
Greville writes his own part.”
“Cockaigne”: On the evening of their
marriage, Mr. and Mrs. Kendal acted in
“As You Like It.” Voice from the Gallery:
“How do you like it, Madge?” Madge: “I

Kean on the evening of their marriage acted

“Ivlematis”: Re Cyril Maude’s perform-
ance of Eccles in “Caste.” Have seen the
old comedy played scores of times in Eng-
land and Australia, but never expect to see
it presented again as the Brough and Bouci-
cault co. played it at Melbourne Bijou over
20 years ago. What an Eccles G. W. Anson
was! Then there was Geo. Titheradge as
Hawtrey, Cecil Ward as the Hon. Delroy,
Mrs. Brough as Esther Eccles, and Pattie
Browne as Polly. I saw no difference be-
tween Maude’s Grumpy and his Eccles.
“Quan” : Westcourt did not win the Mel-
bourne Cup. There was not a close finish
for the race. Neither did the race take place
at Flemington or any other course within
hundreds of miles of Melbourne. The race
was won by a nag with No. 3 on his saddle-
cloth —Westcourt’s was branded “12.” More-
over, the race was run right-handed—which
is not the way races are run. at Flemington
or any 7 other course in Victoria. I know all
about it. I saw the proceedings screened
at a Sydney suburban picture-show the other
night.
“Norbell”: Walter Bentley, general sec.
Actors’ Association, quoting me from B.
8/11/T7, declares that the Actors’ Associa-
tion was not started as a counterblast to the
Struggling Actors’ Union, nor has the Assoc,
"done its damnedest” to help the manage-
ments squelch the Union. What it did, he
claims, was to assist the managements to
protect the profession against a bogus
attempt at unionism. The profession so
“protected” will smile loudly. Soon after
the Union was formed, primarily to protect
the profession from being exploited by those
same managements —it was composed of
many well-known actors and actresses—it
was deregistered, largely through the activi-
ties of the Assoc. According to Bentley the
Assoc, doesn’t want to register itself, yet this
is an excerpt from a report which bears his
signature:—
During the month the most important business that
has occupied the attention of the council has been
the proposal made by Mr. Walter Baker, vice-presi-
dent, and agreed to by the council, _ that the Associa-
tion be formed into a theatrical union.
Now, who’s playing with a double-headed

“Corio”: On a little plot of li acres,
washed over by a small creek near the great
spud-growing district of Warrnambool
(Vic.), settlers at different periods have
tried to grow a crop, with the result that
the flood-waters washed all growth away
year after year. One Lucky Jim, however,
fluked a crop one dry season when the flood
missed, and bagged 37 tons to the acre.
Record, gentlemen?
“D.F.”: Local authorities say that the
first full-rigged ship built in Tasmania was
the 232-ton Maria Orr, turned out at
Macquarie Point in 1838. The Government
of the day gave her a suit of sails to mark
the event. She was in the whaling business
for a long time (during part of which her
owner had the appropriate name of Seal;
and used to work up into the North Pacific,
going as far on one trip as the Aleutian
Islands, off Alaska. The oil she brought to
Hobart, where it was transhipped to London.
“8.T.” : How soon we settle down to new
conditions! I tried to buy some confec-
tionery with a half-sovereign the other day
in a Melbourne suburb, but the girl behind
the counter shied at the coin. “V by, I
said, “it’s a good half-sovereign.” ‘Yes,
said the girl, “but those aren’t money now.
“Spud-sneaker” : The latest Yankee method
of growing potatoes is the “cubical bed.’ A
space about Sft. x lift, is enclosed with stout
battens set horizontally a couple of inches
apart. The ground inside is well broken up,
and a six-inch layer of soil spread over it.
Straw is used at the sides to keep the soil
in. Lines are drawn 12 inches apart, and
where they cross a piece of seed-
potato is planted. Some rotted manure
is put over them, and another 6-inch layer
of earth. The process is repeated to a
height of six feet till the bin is full, the
earth being sloped in at the top to hold
moisture. About the fourth layer a piece
of timber is inserted for a couple of feet
into the bin to serve as an opening for test-
ing the moisture and heat. The potatoes are
said to mature in 90 days, and to do well in
'liot weather because moisture, ventilation
and drainage are all under accurate control.
When the potatoes are ready, the bin is
taken down and the spuds raked out, thus
saving digging costs. If this and the new
nitrogenised peat method are successful, the
denizens of Dungaree and NA\. Tasmania
will find the wind blowing very chilly
through their whiskers.
“C.F.E.”: This country is borrowing on
what it can produce. At present this comes
mostly from the soil. It has been shown
that in many parts of Victoria pastures
are being impoverished owing to the entire
absence of the practice of top-dressing with
phosphates. This must eventually take toll
of the wool and cattle _ industry. We are
exporting wheat whole, instead of returning
to the soil, in some measure, via bran and
pollard, the phosphates taken to form the
grain. We should mill all our wheat here,
exporting only flour, and make the offal
cheap and within easy reach of the small
farmer. We import from Ocean and Mar-
shall Islands phospliatic rock. The other
day, Herman, Vic. Government Geologist,
stated that phosphatic deposits exist in the
State, but so far have not been proved ! So
all the money and efforts of an expensive
Government department have gone to prove
the existence of already-known saddle reefs,
dykes, indicators and deep leads, while the
“great primary industry” has to look to
imported mineral to carry on. After all
these years of guff, bluff, blither and blather
we learn that our great necessity (plios-
phate), although known to exist, has not
yet been proved. Truly an indictment ot
ignorance in the farmers and politicians
alike ! So much so that, at a conterence ot
the former lately held in Melbourne, no men-
tion was made of Herman’s statement,
though all must have read it in the papers.
The mining of phosphatic rock will surely
leave a hole in the ground, but it will yield
a greater golden harvest than the multitude
of so-called gold-mines with which this State
of Victoria and Australia generally are
riddled.
* -*• "*■
“Papua” : An alteration in the Australian
tariff to allow Papuan products to enter the
Commonwealth on fair terms would be the
means of establishing several big industries
—if Australia is in earnest about such
things. For instance, the jungles teem with
about a dozen sorts of rattan-cane, all of
value in the manufacture of furniture, etc.
Many varieties of gum abound ; the tests of
these, according to the commercial chemists
who examined them, show that they are all
suitable for the preparation of varnish,, muci-
lage, etc. Maize is grown to perfection on
the flat lands, and four crops a year are cer-
tain. The products of maize are many, and
include meal, oil, cake for stock, etc., besides
cheap glucose. Bananas grow everywhere
without much cultivation, and a great trade
in oranges, pineapples, limes, lemons, etc.,
could be worked up by preferential freights
and a low tariff. Sugar is indigenous, and
most of the present best canes grown in
Australia and Fiji came from Papua. Huge
tracts of sugar land are available, and native
labor is sufficient for many years to come.
The plantations of rubber and cocoanuts
already established show what can be done,
and ere many more years the rich lands
will be rushed by investors from America
and Europe, unless the Australian winds up
his alarm clock.

a crabbed and moth-eaten look, suggestive
of the need of somebody’s dead-sure worm-
tablets earlier in life. One thing led to
another, and Jennings told me about “Square
Deal” Henningham. It seemed, apropos of
the afflicted apples, that there was only one
man in this country more insistent on a “fair
do” than he —Jennings—and that man had,
as it were, taken medals for it. “Jes’ t’
let yeh see,” said Jennings, wagging an im-
pressive forefinger at me. “This feller was
cornin’ up from Tanbark one day, after
deliA r erin’ a few tubs iv butter, when he
comes on Bill Eagles’s missus lyin’ in the
grass, all broke up ’n’ battered. It seems
Bill had took rum fer his lumbago to such
an extent he wasn’t responsible, ’n’ he’d got
to Annie, ’n’ more’n ’arf killed her. Well,
Henningham put Mrs. Eagles in his cart, ’n’
brought her home. Her left arm was broke,
’n' Henningham, bein’ a handy man with
tools, set it. He made a good job of it, too,
and though it did mend with two elbows,
Mrs. Eagles could milk with it much about
as good as new. Well, six months passed,
’n’ Bill Eagles got over his lumbago ’n’
repented, ’n’ he called on Henningham one
day. What d’ yeh think? Dam’ if he didn’t
want his wife back! Henningham heard
him out, ’n’ sez he: ‘The law’s with yeh, ’n’
if you want her back after all I done for her
I can’t stop you. But I’m ‘Square Deal’
Henningham. ’n’ I stands for me rights. You
know how I mended that woman. What
about compensation?’ Bill Eagles wouldn’t
hear of it. ‘Square deal,’ sez Henningham.
‘l’ll have my wife,’ sez Eagles. ‘Oh, very
well, then,’ Henningham sez, ’n’ he marches
in. ’n’ presently brings out the woman half
faintin’ ’n’ hands her over. ‘Square deal,’
sez he. Square deal it was— he'd broken her
arm again!”

“D.F.”: The Federal Council of Science
and Industry has proclaimed: with a flourish
of trumpets that the production of potash
from kelp is one of the things which it ought
to throw a little light upon. Well, Tas-
mania is far enough behind the times; but
even there Eric Wright set to work long ago
at making potash out of the Southport kelp
beds. Perhaps he could save these scientists
trouble and give the Council a few points on
how it is done.
“Khaki”: The Jap has scored another
point against local industry. This time it’s
green peas, preserved. The imported article
is vastly inferior to that produced locally,
but it is cheaper, which, of course, tickles
that bad Australian, the housekeeper, in the
right place. The few manufacturers w 7 ho
have shown? enterprise in this line are now
standing by helplessly while their market is
annexed, because the Phews Government is
the biggest fraud this country ever did
penance for. We'll be importing wallabies'
next.
SPEND A FEW BOB ON THE WIFE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh, say, don’t you remember the sweets that you
bought her
Before she was married to j r ou,
In the old jealous days when she was somebody s
daughter
And other men haunted her too ?
Now she's tied to the back of your thirty-bob cot-
tage—
She’s tied just as tight as the pup —-
When she might have been queen of young Broad-
meadows’ squattage
If only she’d “given you up” !
But she didn’t, God bless her! The way women
reason,
You tell all your friends, drives you mad ;
All her relatives worried her right through your
season
And told her what money Broad, had.
She was obstinate, very! You’ve noticed that fail-
ing,
And told her quite frankly, my friend,
And it’s true! If it wasn’t, you wouldn’t be
sailing
'With her for a mate till the end.
Yes, she’s struggling at home with the housework
unending
(The maid's got a better “place” now),
And the work and the children, the worry and mend-
ing.
Have furrowed her housewifely brow.
If she sighs now and then for the ease she rejected
When she promised to share all your life —
Well, perhaps it’s because she feels rather neglected ;
So spend a few bob on the wife.
Never mind if your conscience says “Son, you can t
spare it!”
You can if you want to, so “part” !
Give her something worth while! Let Jier eat it
or wear it;
’Twill show her you still have a heart.
She will scold you for wasting your money—but
waste it,
Though it means a trade war to the knife ! i
Married courtship’s good fun and you certainly taste
it
When you spend a few bob on the wife.

RUINED BY RAIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“This wet weather will put a lot of hens off
laying and induce many to moult. Eggs will be
much scarcer within a few days:”
Down comes the rain ! Up goes the breakfast egg!
The hen moults sadly in the streaming yard
Ami dreams of chicks upon one frozen leg.
(The ways of Nature are extremely hard.)
'lhe grocer groans behind his precious shells
And pleads the rain because their price is high;
The dripping customer, with anger swells
And plainly signals “Liar” with her eye.
Cakes taste like sawdust ; puddings are absurd ;
Wives rail and grocers grumble in deep bins.
Out in the rain a wet, neglected bird
Wonders if she is chickless for her sins.
She sees her feathers drop and sail away,
And puzzles why the old trick wasn't recur;
An hour ago —or was it yesterday?—-
She only had to cluck, and there you were!
Bring on your conjurers with sleeves turned back
Who smile and find eggs floating in the air!
Set them to work around this ancient hack
Who croaks and shivers in her eggless lair.
No use! The old egg-factory is shut
Until the sun comes out and feathers stay;
Then will the rooster, bursting from his hut,
Proclaim: “She’s off! Score one to us!
Hooray!”

tion or adjustment.

mended conditions.

FORMER for low-voltage trip fur-
nished when low voltage trip is used

LOW-VOLTAGE TRIP furnished
when desired. This is a mechanical
trip and operates independently of the
overload trip coils.
FIXED CONTACTS are flared at
lower ends to form arcing tips. This
construction reduces to a minimum
the burning or pitting of working con-
tact surfaces.
MOVABLE CONTACTS are
wedge shaped and confine arc to top
of blades and flared portion of contact
fingers. Contacts are kept clean and
bright by rubbing action when
switch is operated.
BARRIERS of laminated wood
separate the poles of the switch when
closed and furnish additional insula-
tion between phases.
OIL VESSEL of sheet steel marked
with line which indicates depth vessel
should be filled for best operation.
'
GUARDS cover dashpots and calibrating
tubes and protect them from injury.
IRON COVER is fastened to frame
by four screws. Easily removed for
examination of connections or mech-
anism.
MOUNTED on any fiat vertical
surface on side opposite operating
handle.
CALIBRATION over wide range.
Figures in white on black calibration
tube. Each trip coil individually
calibrated.
AUTOMATIC TRIP coils in series
with line and act directly on mech-
anism. With inverse time dashpot
trip, switch will not open on motor
starting current, but will trip if over-
load is continuous or if motor runs
single-phase. Automatic switches
cannot be held closed on overload or
short circuit.
OPERATING HANDLE held in
closed position by locking latch which
is lifted to open switch by hand.
OUST CLIP prevents dust or lint
collecting in calibrating tube and
interfering with operation of time-
limit overload trip.
WIRING: Switches arranged for
open or conduit wiring. When shipped
all but two entrances are closed by
removable metal disks.
The Type F Form K2O switch is in line with safety first principles. All the live parts are enclosed,
the connections inside the cover and the contacts under oil. Recommended for use in textile,
flour and powder mills, coal mines, gas works, oil refineries, etc., where inflammable material or
explosive gases are prevalent..

Used the
World Over
PEOPLE WITH THIN BLOOD.
Some people have a tendency to become
thin-blooded, just as others have an inherited
tendency to rheumatism or to nervous dis-
orders. The condition in which the blood
becomes so thin that the whole body suffers
comes on so gradually and stealthily that
anyone with a natural disposition in that
direction should watch the symptoms care-
fully. Bloodlessness, or anaemia, as the
medical term is, can be corrected much more
easily in the earlier stages than later. It
begins with a tired feeling that rest does
not overcome, the complexion becomes pale,
and breathlessness on slight exertion, such
as going upstairs, is noticed.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are a home
remedy that has been most successful in
the treatment of diseases caused by thin
blood. With pure air and wholesome food
these blood-making pills afford the correct
treatment when the symptoms described are
noticed. A former sufferer from anaemia
says: “I was emaciated and did not have a
particle of color. I had severe headaches,
had no ambition, and could just drag
around. Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills quickly
restored appetite, flesh and health.” Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills are to be had of all
dealers who sell medicine.
A valuable little book on “Building Up
the Blood’” will be sent free to any address
on application to the Dr. Williams’ Medi-
cine Co., Box 594, G.P.0., Sydney.— Advt.

TRY MAGNESIA FOR YOUR
STOMACH TROUBLE.
IT NEUTRALISES ACIDITY AND
PREVENTS FERMENTATION.
Before giving up hope and deciding that
you are a chronic dyspeptic, just try the
effect of a little magnesia—not the ordi-
nary carbonates, oxides or citrates, but
bisurated magnesia, which you can obtain
from practically any chemist in either
powder or tablet form. Take half a tea-
spoonful of the powder or two compressed
tablets with a little water after your next
meal. It will neutralise the harmful acid
in your stomach, dispel the wind, soothe
and heal your inflamed stomach, and quickly
relieve your indigestion. Many hundreds of
sufferers have gained relief from this simple
remedy, amongst them Mr. P. V. Anderson,
of Cooray, Queensland, who says:—“'l h a( *
suffered from indigestion for about five
years, and had tried all sorts of treatment
without success, when a friend advised me
to give bisurated magnesia a trial. I ain
very glad I did so, for I experienced imme-
diate relief and am now completely cured
of my trouble.” Did space permit, many
identical experiences might be quoted, all
tending to prove that, if you keep your
stomach free from harmful acids by taking
bisurated magnesia after meals, you need
never fear any serious form of digestive or
stomach trouble. But, of course, it m us
be bisurated magnesia—other forms might do
more harm than good.— Advt.

POLITICAL
POINTS
[4l Telegraph Chambers, Queen-street, Brisbane.]
This is not a bad test: How would you
vote if you were a German?
Hobart Daily Post had its little joke
after Hughes delivered his Bendigo speech.
It submitted its report to the Censor on the
ground that the matter was, in its opinion,
prejudicial to recruiting.
Frank Tudor, Arthur Rae and the rest
say that voluntaryism will supply all the
men that are wanted. Very well, then they
can safely vote Yes; for not a man will be
conscripted if what they say is true. And if
what they say isn’t true, why should any-
body follow them?
“Australia has done enough”—a very good
argument applied to anything except re-
inforcements. There is a job for three horses,
and a contractor sends them. But if one of
them is killed, would he say: “I sent three
horses. One has been killed. I can’t help
that; I have done enough—let the driver
flog the other two”? Is Australia going to
treat Billjim worse than it would a mule-
team?
MORE FRIGHTFUL NESS.
“They say when the Germans were here
they stahled their horses in some of
these cathedrals.”
‘That’ll show you what they are! A horse
might easy slip on them smooth stone
floors."
Canberra lias been bad enough; but if
Wilfrid Blacket had been sent to the North-
ern Territory to investigate the manner in
which public works have been carried out
there by the Commonwealth, all he said
about the Federal capital would sound like
compliments. Nearly five years have been
spent constructing 60 miles of railway from
Pine Creek to Katherine. The country is
almost level, yet the cost to date has been
nearly £12,000 per mile. And even then
almost everything in connection with the
job is done either wrongly or badly, and a
good deal is not yet done at all. The river
and creek abutments are insufficient and
unstable, the bridges are not completed and
in some instances hardly touched, and
the ballasting is a disgrace. Such white
labor as there is in the Northern Territory
seems bent upon proving all that the oppo-
nents of white labor for the North have
ever said. Millar Bros., using Chinese
coolies under white supervision, completed
the line from Darwin to Pine Creek in two
years. The first 77 miles cost them £BOO
per mile; the remaining 69 miles cost £lBOO
—less than half the contract price and one-
sixth of what the extension has cost the
Commonwealth.
Frank Anstey is absolutely opposed to it:
I am against the war because I cannot see it makes
for the advance of civilisation.
But what in the name of Heaven is the good
of announcing to a war that F. Anstey is
against it? Anstey might just as well ascend
to a high place when the next Antarctic dis-
turbance bursts through Port Phillip Heads
and proclaim his opposition to gales, rain,
thunder, lightning and hail. It wouldn’t pre-
vent him getting blown into the bay if he
omitted to hold on.
[MUIR AULD, 214 George-street, Sydney.]
SEVERE TREATMENT.
HE: “I say — aw — you're jolly hard on a
chap, aren’t you? First of all, you turn
me down, and now you’re going to rote
for Conscription."
The opening of the Anti-Conscription cam-
paign by Opposition-leader Frank Tudor, at
a Richmond (Vic.) picture-theatre, began
with a vaudeville tprn by two kid-acrobats,
followed by a “serio-comic” songstress. Then
the curtain was dropped, while the audience
hummed like a hive, and presently a tableau
of Tudor and his pals was disclosed upon the
stage, amid frantic cheering and a complete
absence of guffaws. The introduction of
vaudeville at a political meeting of sup-
posedly national importance, with the grand
llamas of the movement in the background, is
the sort of impossible thing one dreams of
after beer-and-crayfish.
“Geo. Logist” : I was having a look round
Wynbring (S.A.), on the East-West line,
while tilings were being prepared for the
opening ceremony on November 12. A newly-
erected rain-gauge caught my eye, and closer
inspection showed it to be a brand-new.

There was a time when Mr. Speaker was
re-elected by his constituents as a matter of
course. But Mr. Speaker is no longer a
demigod. The last two elections in N. S.
Wales have emptied the chair; and now, in
Victoria, Frank [Madden finds himself look-
ing up from the bottom of the poll at
Boroondara, which he had more or less rep-
resented for 23 years.
When Mrs. Cochrane left Melbourne
Divorce Court the other day she not only
disconnected herself from a deserting hus-
band but ‘also from a moderate income. In
November, ’l3, Cochrane married the lady,
she being then 24 and he 17. In the follow-
ing September he enlisted and allowed her
£2 2s. a fortnight out of his pay. A month
later lie was discharged as medically unfit,
and disappeared from the Defence records.
But the Department continued paying Mrs.
Cochrane the guinea a week, and would pro-
bably have kept on paying it till the end of
time but for her frankly reporting the cir-
cumstance. After that it seemed hardly
necessary for the Commission which is in-
quiring into the business management of
Pearce’s slovenly department to mention
that it would recommend a few changes in
practice.
There is a howl from a few dozen news-
paper offices in Australia that the gag is
being applied. This paper can’t work up
much sympathy for most of those who are
suffering, or are in danger of suffering.
They knew what happened before; they
knew who was responsible for it happening;
and they took no steps to remove the power
from the hand that had used, or abused, it.
The Worker and those on the Labor side
may reasonably kick ; as for the Liberals, or
Nationalists, they have earned all that they
get.
“Try Fluke” : The agile Hindu, overflow-
ing from Fiji, is pushing farther into the
country districts of Northern M.L. They
may quit when the boys come home ; but all
the' king’s horses and all the king’s men
won’t be able to undo some of the dirty work
they are doing among the native girls. Tan-
gata Maori is much perturbed, and one
Upper Wanganui rangatira told me he in-
tended petitioning Guv’mint to send all the
tangata mangumangu —“blackfellows” —back
to their own country and save the Maori
race from further pollution. But it shouldn’t
be necessary for the Maori to petition in
order to secure the protection of the Govern-
ment in a matter of this kind.
Ryan, of Bananaland, struck a high note
the other day. Learning that Hughes had
threatened to drop the War Precautions Act
on anyone “telling lies” about compulsory
military service, Ryan smote the atmosphere
with indignant noise. “I refuse to be in-
timidated,” he announced. “I will defy”——
But the rest was blown through the roof
with the applause of those who admire
defiance of everybody except W. Hohenzol-
lern.
There have been 35 Ministries in N. S.
Wales since Responsible Government was
granted in 1856, and 34 of them have been
named after their Premiers. But the
“Parliamentary Record,” recently issued,
indicates the present crowd not as the
Holman, but as the National Ministry.
Hurried journalists of the future will skir-
mish through the reference books to see if he
had a front name.
Of 46 “Australian” civilians interned at
Ruhleben (Germany) 22 carry German
names. Here are some of them: Wagner,
Fritsch, Rosentaegel, Johannson, Ivahle,
Reuther, Ludwig. Stormer, Lehmann,
Issberner, Koschave, Lorenz, Brambach,
Leruschew and Steitz. But they came from
Australia, so 'in they went on general prin-
ciples. It rs only the “silly, stupid Pritish”
who chance it.
The Vic. elections were above all else a
triumph for the machines. It cost the
unattached George Meudell £5O, besides his
expenses, to discover that the electors don’t
want a good Australian, with brains and
energy, to represent them in Parliament.
Like another patriotic battler in the Federal
sphere—Charles Atkins —he adorned the tail
of the procession, getting but one vote of
every 14 cast in Grenville. Yet either
Meudell or Atkins is worth a score of ordi-
nary party hacks.

must. Before .1914 Australian ham- and
bacon-c-urers never or hardly ever used Aus-
tralian salt —it wasn’t suitable. They actu-
ally paid more for English salt than they
could have bought good Australian for. But
in 1914 Wilhelm von Botzdam levied his
tariff and, ever since, the pig-curers have
used the good Australian article. Also
they make no complaint about it: it isn’t
any use, any more than it would have been
if a really Protective tariff had been in force
all along.
Vic. Labor-leader’s Elmslie’s comment on
the result of the State elections —that “he
regarded it as satisfactory from the Labor
point of view”—is evidence of the dry rot
that has attacked all the old stumps of ttie
party. Labor gained four seats and lost one
and now has barely a third of the member-
ship of the people’s House. Yet, with the
discredited Peacock Ministry tottering, the
Opposition had a chance that comes about
once in a generation.
Japan lately launched a 9000-ton steamer
in three months from the time of laying the
keel, and 10 days later she ran her trials.
Still, why worry? Doesn’t Australia’s great
shipbuilding project still provide Hughes
with a subject for talk about what he’s going
to do ?

To print their red into our unstained shores ?

White faces look towards the autumn skies,
Drained of their life blood to make red those feet.
How small are some of those bare skeletons
The turning ploughshares in the brown earth meet!
The merry babes that o’er her fields should dance
Have helped to make the weeds grow long in France.
The condor wing has lain on Belgium,
The condor head is reaching over France;
The great beak strikes intp the quivering land.
Men of Australia, shall that wing perchance
Lie like a damned cloud across our sun?
Answer, Australia, with the shouldered gun!

At W arwick Farm on Saturday the
punters got one* in the eye to start with; but it
goes on happening and they go on trying to beat it.
There was a field of 23 in the Maiden, and Ottadeni,
an Earlston filly that had shown speed last season as
a two-year-old, was backed down to 7 to 4. No one
noticed the Grafton colt Gurranang, mainly perhaps
because this nag in a couple of starts on preceding
Saturdays had shown a disinclination to take part
in the final proceedings. But that didn’t stop him
winning this time. It was a 20 to 1 chance and
benefited no one but Ike. The glorious uncertainty of
racing is all very well to read about, but the fre-
quency with which people try to show that there is
nothing in the yarn is only equalled by their per-
sistency in clinging to the delusion that what hap-
pened yesterday is going to repeat itself to-morrow.
The imported mare Chantarella, owned by
the proprietors of Polycrates and for a time made a
boom in Sydney by more or less irresponsible per-
sons, hurried up at the right end last week. A
couple of weeks before she did well in the Granville
Stakes at Rosehill, and on Saturday at Warwick
Farm she upset a hot-pot for the Farm Stakes in
Tressamita. There was about enough merit in the
performance to make a few' people call themselves
names when they remembered having followed the
Chantarella boom and backed her for the Epsom of
a year ago.

Trainer Jim Scobie led in his seventh Ben-
digo Cup winner when Rosanna took the prize
this year. Beginning with Kallara in ’96, Scobie
followed up with The Bride (two occasions),
Sinnang, Glue and Stageland (last year). Incident-
ally Bobby Lewis, the stable’s lucky jockey, has
steered seven winners.
* * * *
Dead —James Wilson, one of the last of
the old-time-Australian horseowners and trainers. The
finish was at Bendigo last week ; the time, 88. Wilson,
known wherever the thoroughbred is talked about
as founder of the St. Albans stud which gave Aus-
tralia some of its most famous nags, hailed from
Yorkshire, but came to. Australia as a lad, and for
the best part of half a century was closely identi-
fied with the turf. Among the best horses he raced
were Ebor, My Dream, Miss Jessie, Bresis, Don Juan,
Abundance, First King, Savanaka, Mermaid, Pro-
gress. He won all the important races in Vie. and
N. S. Wales once or more, including the Melbourne
Cup (twice), Australian Cup (four times), and Syd-
nev Cup (ditto). The first horse the old man ran
at Flemington was Paul Jones, in ’47. His last
win was with Hush Money two years ago.
* * * *
London Referee has been discussing the
old question whether a greyhound is as fast as a
horse. The general opinion seems to be that it is
faster. Walter Winans says that, riding a thorough-
bred at 10st., he has found it impossible to live
with foxhounds running in view of the fox, or even
on a good scent; and the greyhound is much faster
than the other dog. Robert A. Smith drops in with
a reminiscence of the Rangitikei race-track, where
(years ago, he thinks about 1886) a young grey-
hound joined in a race and beat the horses by 50
yards. He believes a mature greyhound at top
form “would beat the best horse ever foaled.”
“B.B.” : You’re never sure of these wow-
sers. The other day in M.L. Chief Justice Stout, a
very eminent saint, knocked a very sporty barrister
sideways by rapping at him, during the hearing of
a racing case, that he (Stout) might know more
about the backing of horses than he (the sport)
thought. “I trust that your Honor does,” said
that party hopeful!}'. Dunno where the Chief does
his betting, unless he punts with the furtive odds
merchant, because he hasn’t been on a racecourse
since 1888, when he allowed himself to be led
astray by tile then Governor of Victoria.
* * * *
The late G. G. Stead, for many years the
biggest racing man in M.L., had his home near Cheli
(M.L.) ; and the place is now being turned into a
Presbyterian Boys’ College. Its associations ought to
make the kids pretty slick at sums, anywav.
* * * *
As Newcastle coal-baron W. Brown is pass-
ing out of the racing business, his stud goes up for
sale. Brown bred horses in a big way and had been
racing long enough to make his livery very well
known; but probably the game cost him a lot more
cash than he ever got out of it. He took the Melbourne
Cup of ’l5 with Piastre, and lately had that really
good mare Thana racing for him. The Brown outfit
is the third big Australian stud to come under the
hammer during the year.
* * * *
An engagement between Albert Lloyd and
Fred Kay at Sydney Stadium on Saturday called
for deliberation by a jury consisting of Arthur
Scott, the proceedings not having terminated when
the closing hour arrived. Scott returned a verdict
in favor of Kay, each side to keep its own damages.
For what happened Lloyd can blame Kay’s educated
feet more than his punch. The long Westralian was
livelier than usual and evaded the heavier man much
in the same way as a mosquito dodges an enraged
citizen who, finding himself bitten in 17 places,
springs frantically around looking for what did it.
The consequence was that Lloyd missed frequently,
and as Kay wriggled away from the punch awaiting
him there were loud demands from the crowd for an
encore. Otherwise there was not much in it all.
Scott’s calculations were probably based on the dam-
age which Kay made the other party fail to inflict
through being somewhere else.

Big Bill (William Irving) Cosgrove, who
died last week, aged 77, was one of Sydney’s best-
known sports of the ’eighties ; and then, as relatives
of his had just missed a fortune at the Barrier
(where Cosgrove’s wouldn’t have been swapped at
one time for the Broken Hill Prop.), he pushed off
early to Coolgardie to see whether he could get
nearer it himself. But he found more money in a
Bay ley-street auction mart than in anything else.
Horses and guns iVere his specialties in the old days.
“Merrigal”: George Henry Taylor, who
dropped out at Dubbo the other day, was a promi-
nent racing man in what Sydney calls the West when
the Lees (Bathurst), the Rouses (Mudgee), Gip
Ford, Tom Ivory and Jack De Clouet (Dublin Jack)
and Honest John (Tait) introduced their nags into
the £2OO and £3OO arguments then prevalent at
Bathurst, Mudgee, Wellington and Dubbo. Though
invading neddies usually outed the locally-tutored
ones, the ’72 Melbourne Cup winner, The Quack, had
been previously beaten at Dubbo by Jack Readford’s
Birmingham, and the ’74 Metrop. victor Sterling
only just beat Gillar in the principal event the fol-
lowing year. But Sterling had won the Cup at
Wellington on the day prior, and had been led the
34 miles separating the two courses.
A good sport went over the hill when

Owen Charles Williams, dead in Ceylon
at 70, was one of the men who helped to make the
East Melbourne Cricket Club. As secretary in the
late ’sixties and early ’seventies, he had a strenuous
time pursuing
subscriptions, and
more than once
had to take round
the hat to rescue
the club’s property
from Cohen. Per-
haps it was this
experience that
helped Williams to
achieve subsequent
success in the
financial world. As
a batsman he had
great disrespect
for bowlers, and
in the field was a
rival of T. J. D.
Kelly, the great
“point” of the
time. Williams

fair success, and

“B.”: With Tibbie Cotter’s death in
action, the Australian XI at the Front has lost its
first wicket. Out of a wide choice the best side
that could be selected in the lines and the camps
would be Macartney, Kellaway, Massie, Minnett,
Taylor (N.S.W.), Matthews, Park (Vic.), Moves,
Pellew, Campbell (S.A.). These, with Cotter, would,
on form, have been a tough proposition for any of
’em.
* * * *
“Slogger” : Last Saturday, from an almost
uninhabited grandstand, I watched a team of timid
batsmen pottering about on a reasonably good wicket
and thought of Cotter, the courageous hitter, dead
in Palestine. The pennant game presently fizzled
to an uninteresting end, and I went out into the
park in the hope of seeing some merry hitting
amongst the rough grass. Not a sign of it! The
pair of average-haunted junior batsmen were potter-
ing and blocking worse than the pennant players,
although one of them had the shoulders of a Lyons.
It’s a fine game if it’s played by sportsmen, but it
makes d —d dull science. I wonder if the war will
put any life into it!

B. B. Barrack (Uni.), with six wickets
for 18 runs, assisted to hand Paddington a halo for
the lowest score (46) in Sydney premiership cricket
this year. It took only 91 balls to finish the innings.
Barrack’s 19 wickets this season have been got at an
average cost of 16.10.
Waverley’s skipper, H. Carter, made a
vigorous 149 against Sydney on Saturday. Finding
the wicket damaged, Carter adopted a policy of biff,
and smote one sixer and 16 fours —70 in boundary
strokes. Afterwards he stumped three and caught
one of Sydney’s seven wickets which toppled in the
second innings. Carter’s last century was 131 against
Paddington in ’l5. This season he has piled up
220 runs at an average of 44, and behind the sticks
his bag has been five stumped and seven caught, and
he has given only 28 byes in an aggregate of 1083
runs. This looks like a return to the form which
pushed Carter into the 1902 Australian XI. as Jim
Kelly’s understudy.

“Pick”: Bill the Blutwurst was respon-
sible for the death of still another good Australian
when in France recently a Hun bullet stopped
David Hunter. In his not-far-back Newington Col-
lege (Sydney) days he was a footballer and all-
round athlete. Later, though he wore the flat hat
of a Methodist parson, he often took on the strenuous
job of football referee, and no man ever commanded
greater respect behind the whistle. To the hosts
of Anzac he was just a good cobber.
There is an account extant of the first long
walk for a wager in Australia. As far back as
August 31, 1794, Lieut.-Gov. Francis Grose in a
despatch to the Right Hon. Henry Dundas wrote:
“I have caused a very good road to be made from
Sydney to the Hawkesbury, by which we discover
the distance from this place by land is much less
than was expected. An officer, who is by no means
considered as being particularly active, undertook
for a trifling wager to walk there from Sydney in
nine hours, and with great ease to himself per-
formed the journey in eight hours and two minutes.
He computed the distance to be two-and-thirty
miles.” The old chap was not far out, as Windsor
is 34 miles by rail.
Scot, the speedy 18-footer, has won three
times in succession this season on Sydney Harbor,
getting away with £36. The handieapper is won-
dering how much more she has up her main sleeve.

“Rimfire”: The Bulletin (8/11/T7) did
not give any performances of E. Mitchell’s rifle-
shooting daughters of Peak" Hill (N.S.W.), so we
can’t make comparisons with the best on the Vic.
side. However, I think Kitty Jackson, of Footscray,
would be quite able to defend the title of champion
lady shot of Australia with small-bore rifle. In
11 shoots she averaged 69J out of 70, and has made
runs of 20, 13, 12 and 10 consecutive bull’s-eyes.
At the recent M.C.C. carnival she won the Murchison
Championship Trophy against all comers with three
possibles. The conditions of this competition were
“as many tries as you like, best three to count,”
and the Red Cross funds benefited considerably
owing to many well-known riflemen ndeavoring to
equal Miss Jackson’s performance. She needed three
tries only! On Saturday week at Williamstown,
in her first attempt with a service weapon, she put
up the respectable score of 34 out of 35 at 200
yards on an Bin. bull.
“The Oldest”: The father of Australian
bowls is, so far as I can trace its ancestry, the late
Alexander Johnstone, of Parramatta, who in 1868
had a set of “wood” turned out by Thomas Fades,
of Pennant-street, Parramatta. Johnstone practised
all by himself at Elizabeth Farm, and was looked
upon as an amiable crank. Presently he interested
three friends in the game, one being Nat Payten,
of the Woolpaek Inn, another Tom Hellyer, an old-
time solicitor. Payten was so enchanted that he
laid down a green at the hotel, the first rink in
Australasia, and there also the first club was formed.
Clarence Weber is to be handed down to
posterity in a portrait painting by Nelson Wood, of
Adelaide, “The Boomerang Thrower,” which shows
his manly proportions in a fine attitude and with the
least possible encumbrance of clothing. It has been
suggested that the picture might be bought by the
Adelaide Art Gallery, but the skin texture is pro-
bably too hard in the rendering for the work to
reach that height.
A big suburban Adelaide tennis club
announces an odd but perfectly genuine reason for
holding a tournament this Christmas. Adelaide has
taken the war very seriously, and first-class tennis
(like first-class everything else) is suspended. But
this club enlarged its grounds just as the war started,
and incurred a big liability, which was shared among
the members. About 20 of them have since gone to
the. Front, but their personal liability continues, and
it is to ease the strain on the affairs of these good
practical patriots that money is to be earned from
the stay-at-homes by a tournament.

Wild deer have been observed within four
miles of Adelaide G.P.O. They are not very wild
•' et ’ having only lately been allowed liberty from a
park where the owner had reared them on the hill
slopes. They have been running longer on Hind-
marsh Island, in the lake near the Murray mouth,
and as wild there as you please.

A new record for 100 miles in a motor-
car was set up by the French driver, Louis Chevro-
let, on the Speedway at Sheepshead Bay, New York,
on September 22. He never changed the pace, and
the car, running without a falter, clipped 24min.
off Dario Resta’s time, finishing in 54min. 20sec.
A week later Chevrolet was beaten on a “dirt-track”
run over five miles by Barnev Oldfield. The dis-
tance was covered in smin. I6see.—a world’s record.
On the same day the Frenchman arrived ahead of
Barney at the end of 10 miles on the same track,
in 12min. losec. Then they had a 15-miles flutter
(it occupied 18min. 37sec.), and at the end Oldfield
had won the rubber.

At Domain (Sydney) baths on Saturday
Tom Morris made a second attack on the record for
the world’s mile back-stroke. Clothed this time in
the regulation neck-to-knee costume he left the

“A Voice from the Bush” : “Nemo’s” state-
ment re the tote being misused, the windoyvs not
being closed while a race was run at an unregis-
tered meeting near Sydney (B. 30/8/’l7), takes my
memory back to a similar occurrence at the Great
Northern meeting at Gladstone (S.A.) in 1881.
When the steeplechase was run I was standing near
the judge's box, and on looking around saw that the
tote windows were gaping. I did a sprint to the
machine that would have been a credit to the late
Frank Hewitt in his palmy days, but, alas, I found
the sports already lined up 10 deep putting their
money on the winner! As I couldn’t get my bit on
I turned dog and gave the show away, calling out to
Sandy Gordon, who was managing the tote, that the
race was over. I then ducked for safety, and the
howls of execration that followed my going haunt
me still.

Why take chances with an inflammable roof when we can
supply a roofing that insurance companies regard as “ equal
to tin, slate or tile” in fire-resisting qualities. This roofing is

In a recent test “Piles of wood
shavings and sawdust, saturated
with gasoline, were burne d for
19 minutes —until consumed —
on the surface of RU -BER-010

the embers were removed and it
was found that the roofing was
blistered but still intact.”
ftU-BER-010 contains no coal tar,
asphaltum oils, wood fibre, paper,
or other inflammable substances.
It costs much less than either tin,
slate or tile.

This co. sticks pretty closely to its commis-
sion business, and doesn’t allow itself to be
enticed far into pastoral finance. Probably
the affluent sheep-breeders of Tasmania don’t
need financing. Or probably the co. keeps
its share capital small in order to have a
good excuse for not making advances. Still
the question is whether it couldn’t do a good
deal better if it let itself go a bit. Really
for a co. over 30 years old with such agencies
as this one already has and could command,
a capital of £B5OO is a bit ludicrous. Apart
from premises (£10.000) and yards, plant
and stock (£6911), the only assets are book
debts of one sort or another, mostly advances
against consignments. £41,124. But by
reason of the _poor little capital, even these
small figures demanded that the co. incur
overdrafts and other liabilities of £34,082.

“Fitzroy” concerning a resurrection :
The Dee, 20 miles out from Mount Morgan, is
the mystery mine of Bananaland. In the
’seventies work proceeded on a large scale
for those days; but there is no official record
of results. I paid a visit to the field a few weeks
ago. Standing out amidst gums and blooming
wattle are half a dozen handsome red-brick chimneys.
A quarter of a mile away, on the bank of a deep
creek, are two 60ft. stacks from a brace of rever-
beratory furnaces. Not a brick is out of place nor
has an iron girder shifted, the arches of the furnaces
being perfect and ready to be fired again within a
week, although a fire has not burned in them for 40
years. But for a 20ft. white cedar growing from
the roof of a furnace and a huge fig-tree between
the stacks the show looks as though it might have
been abandoned only a couple of years. They made
good firebricks in those days; probably these were
brought from England by some windjammer. The
10,000 tons of dump lying around give evidence
of the co.'s activity. The underground development
is considerable, the principal workings being two
shafts on the side of the hill. Bushfires have cleaned
up all but the stumps of the poppet legs, but a
whim which provided the winding gear of the day
still stands. A mile away is a 120 ft. tunnel with
crosscuts and winzes thickly populated with flying-
foxes and snakes. When the mine closed, and why,
nobod\ seems to be able to say, though possibly
there's one man in Sydney who could tell a tale.
The probability i? that it was a sink for some
of the English capital which poured into Queensland
mining propositions in the ’seventies, and the shut-
ters went up when the overseas crowd got tired of
paying calls. Assays taken by some Mount Morgan
men were good enough to make them want to
reopen and work the show. But the owners, the
Scottish Australian Mining Co., have hitherto asked
prohibitive terms. There has been no chance of the
Government training a gun on the co., as the pro-
perty is held under mineral freehold tenure, which
gives them the right to do as they please, and they
chose to rent it to a grazier. However, at last the
co. has been prevailed upon to listen to reason, and
arrangements are now being made to reopen the
mine and explore the ore bodies. The working of
the mine has been made a lot easier by the building
of the Dawson Valley line, which is only three miles
away.
* * * .
F. A. Govett has again been holding forth
on the burdens of Westrafian gold-mining.
At the Lake View and Star meeting lie
talked of the “Australian Governments’ con-
stant support of labor, their apathy about
gold stealing, their insistence on high rail
fi eights, and the high import duties on min-
ing materials. But all these were insigni-
ficant compared with the “senseless tax-
ation" which was imposed. The interests
of gold-mining were subordinated to the
Governments’ need for revenue, whereas the
wisest thing to do would be to relieve the
industry of all taxation, direct and indirect,
and admit all mining materials free. Then
he proceeded to mention that mines were a
wasting asset and what looked like profits
generally weren't profits. That is quite
true. But Govett, old campaigner that he
is, made a mistake in mentioning it in this
connection. For, a mine being a wasting
asset, the State is bound to recover the
capital sunk in railways, waterworks, etc.,
to sen e it. And how it can recover the capi-
tal except through freights, taxes, etc.. Gov-
ett doesn’t mention. There never were a
group of capitalists in all the world, per-
haps, who had so much done for them and
were called on to do so little in return as
the London Jews, etc., who skimmed Kal-
goorlie. If they had paid 10 times what
they have paid to the State they would not
have disgorged a penny too much. As it is
they have the tens of millions of gold ; the
State has the tens of millions 0 f debt And
the gratitude the State gets is this greedv
old man’s abuse.
*
Westralia’s gold yield this year will prob-
ably be about IOO.OOOoz. below that of 1916,
and but little more than half of what it was
in the zenith year 1903. The causes of the
shrinkage are: (1) exhaustion of phenome-
nally rich surface stone; (2) war-time costs
being too heavy for low-grade producers to
stand up against. Yilgarn, propped up by
Westonia. is the only field that is not likely
to show a substantial falling-off in the year’s
production. Meantime the almost-desperate
Government is doing all it can to impart a
stimulus to the industry by giving pros-
pectors loans and equipment and by the
State battery system.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
.Vo notice (except of a hostile character ) will be
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on the MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
Australian Woman: Dear lady, the truth
is never dirty. It is the suppression of it that
causes all the trouble. And a woman who blushes
to read it has need of a few earnest moments with
her own conscience. .. .F.S.S.: Interesting; but
there might be trouble about the disclosures....
Nobby: All light, have it that way—the Jones
Brothers was wrecked, not while trying to get out
of Newcastle Harbor, but while trying to come back
after trying to get out... .Catamain: Too du11....
Semper: The difficulties are obvious enough. Can
you tell us how to overcome them ?.... Marion E.:
Maybe; but you can’t disprove off-hand like that.
....Bill Bullen: Yes, Bill; but you’re several years
too late with it... . Mentora: Not what we want,
but try again... .Tongio: None up, but have
another shot... .H.P.T.: Hardly; but it might be
acceptable to one of the dailies. Returning copy.
. ...K.B. (W.A.) : (1) When did Maud Allen play
that? (2) Good luck to him.... Moore: N 0....
M.R.11.: You should have sent stamps. That sub-
ject is a bit frayed, anyway... .Notabean (S.
Africa): You’ll never have a bean if you depend
on selling us that old cabbage. .. .R.C.: Doesn’t
strike us... .G.D.C.: Just commonplace rhymes... .
W.G.T.: “Sympathy” lacks any sort of distinction.
J. : Not our style... ,H.L.: Doesn't seem to
quite carry the story .R.J.J.A.: There isn’t a
yarn in that 1.0. G.: It is too frail O.B.: We
like the nut-cracker effect in the last stanza: —
The Boss came back, caught them in the act,
Except poor old Billy, and poor old Jack Mack ;
Playing cards, and not on the contract.
All received notice and got the sack.
... .E.F.C.: No use... .Orion: “Rockies” hasn’t
enough meat... .M.R.: Nice verse, but no force in
it....Wao: 0ut.... A.A.K.: “The Lamp” isn't
bright enough... .A.8.C.: Stories not our style....
K. : Verses don’t shout for publication... .F.C.8.:
Dreary rhymes... .P.A.: You belong to the gentle,
wilting school. .. .W.A.0.: That’s a fine finish:—
War-statesman baits his hookies;
He sighs
Of bonus or of tax;
And cries
Of what the nation lacks.
His eyes
Are blind, without the knacks
Of learning from the chookies.
. ...C.M.L.: A long, long way off. ... J.G.M.: No
use. .. .H.C.: Glad you call them poems. We’ve
seen no worse verse for a whole day J.K.8.: Not
up L.E.8.: A hint of promise in them....
H.A.S.: Weak little thing. .. .E.R.: No. .. . A.H.N.:
Too thin F.S.: Not for us, thanks E.P.P.:
Wants either more strength or better craftsmanship.
. —E.C.C.: It doesn’t get anywhere... .R.S.: Knock
‘Australian Desert” into better shape and let us
see it again G. 8.: Not up E.A.A.: Some
cleverness, but the verse is not well enough
handled.... Bill Bluegum : This should get them: —
Twelve long months of halcyon-losing war
Have now passed by
Since Australia, as she’d ne’er done before,
Deserted her own countrymen—-
Brave gunners and infantrymen.
Now has Australia one more chance to show,
All may rely,
That one and all would ne’er again vote “No,”
But, turning on all shirkers, exclaim “Go!”
....Liz: “Recruit” doesn’t quite convince....
Stanholm: Pompous verse which amounts to
nothing. .. .L.J.: The feeble sort of verse that
fumbles along harmlessly Fernlaaf: You’re im-
proving; but you can stand more ef it Warrego
William: Not enough in it S.C.C.: Crude work.
... . J.A.: “The Influx” is nothing. If you want to
write verse, write it. Chopped prose won't do
Rene Roo: Too clumsy F.G.S.: Rubbish....
A.F.F.: Bumpy stuff with no skill. .. .J.H.S.:
Feeble effort Nico: Awful.... Aragun: Not up... .
G.A.: No use... .E.F.8.: N 0... .Cornstalk :It doesn’t
grip. .. .P.8.P.: When did you ever see anything
faintly resembling that in this paper? AAV.:
“Melted Butter” won’t run through these pages....
G. 8.: “Prodigal” is the limit of commonplace....
Philos: If you know, as you say, that it is neither
up to our standard nor in our style, why send it ?
. ... A.S.: Don’t care for the “Drvad”... .
V. : Easy verse without purpose or force.
Looks as if you would have to feel something before
you could write about it. .. .H.T.0.: Nothing...,
E.N.D.: The usual tame prose masquerading as
verse R.F.: Sorry; but “Vignettes” don't quite
get us C.G.: “Fish” a little too cheap J.H.:
Neither version of “Silence” quite satisfies. But
there is promise in both S.A.K.: “Modern
Novel” no good 0.C.: Tame sort of mirth that.
. ...M.S.: Not up....C.L.: Feeble stuff... .Jock :
Horror,.. .V.J.: The “Situation” doesn’t appeal.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
1.J.5.: Stodgy production. Where are the stamps
for its return fare? Bott: Don't quite see why the
aeroplanist should fall into the cemetery.... Snake-
frog. Not worth while. Always write name and
address on the back of your drawings.... G.M.: Idea
too slight, and sketch too rough. ... A.1.W.: One of
its faults is that the aboriginal has two left feet....
W. : A dazzling collection of blots and smudges.
Acquire a better style F.W.H.: Not enough in-
terest in it, and the. drawing isn’t correct... .S.T.:
You’re a long, long way from publication L.G.:
Sorry, seventeen! Study and improve your line....
M. 8.: You’ve just started, and we cannot prophesy.
C.W.T.: Nothing there for us. By the way, the
pen-name “Cross-cut” is the property of an old
Bulletin- contributor. Get another JAV.L.: Sad
thing and r.o stamps to go home with. .. .G.C.: Take
away your pancake people and study perspective.
The Deans, of Adelaide, must have some-
thing like a record for military commissions.
Colonel George, the father, had long been
one of S.A.’s chief non-professional soldiers.
He nearly died of enteric on Gallipoli, and
has since been in charge of transports. Of
his sons. Edwin went away as a major in
command of a battery, and is now Colonel
and D.S.O. at 32. Alan, who was on Gal-
lipoli, is a staff-captain in France. Xance,
who went as a bombardier, is a lieut. in
France. Leslie sailed this month as a lieut.
of artillery. And William (whom the doc-
tors will not accept) is in charge of the
recruiting-office in Adelaide. That accounts
for all the sons. The only daughter is the
wife of Duncan Hughes, an Adelaide lawyer
who is captain of artillery in France.

What Bui lock-driver R, WHITE- Says:
Mr. R. White, bullock-driver to the Beenak Sawmilling Co., of Gippsland, Vidloria, writes to say that delay in the arrival
of his Meggitt Linseed Meal left his bullocks without their usual feed. His teams fell off in condition, work, and refused their food.
When the Meal arrived his bullocks —but read what he says :
Messrs.

Meggitt Ltd., Sydney. Yarra Junction, 19/4/’ 17.
Dear Sirs,—Since using your Linseed Meal my bullocks have done wonderfully well.
After one week on the Heal their coats shone and looked glossy. Bullocks fed on Heal never get com=
They won’t eat the chaff now without the Meal. R. WHITE, Beenak Sawmilling Co.

PHOSPHATE ENHANCES VALUE OF
FOOD.
MAINTAINS STRENGTH AND IN-
CREASES VIM, VIGOR AND VITALIK
Never before has there been so much
public discussion of the relative values of
various foods, but the most important phase
of the whole subject has been overlooked and
passed by. We learn that one article pos-
sesses greater food value than another, but
the term “food value” is not clearly defined.
Food is eaten to satisfy hunger, but if we
merely eat of available foods until hunger
is appeased, we display no greater intelli-
gence than the animals. Averaee men ana
women of to-day, though, take a real inter-
est in what they eat, and carefully select
foods suitable to their needs. Careful obser-
vation will show that foods rich in phosphate
are being chosen to-day, because it is well
known that the phosphate extracted fro®
such foods by the process of digestion *
quickly absorbed by the nerves and trans-
formed into much-needed strength, vigor MP*
vitality. Nervous strength is the source anfl
foundation of all strength, both mental aM
physical, and phosphate is the only known
element capable of creating nervous strengt •
Thus we see the importance of daily supp.
ing the nerves with a sufficiency of pn°
phate. But it is not necessary that }
whole of this phosphate should be “ er . iy
from food by the laborious process of op -
tion. A far better plan is to eat modern .
of plain, inexpensive, easily digested ro -
und then take a 5-grain tablet of o'
phosphate immediately after every ® ■
Bitro-phospliate greatly increases, the ne
nutrient value of foods. It is r * a •
absorbed by the nerves and rapidly tr
formed into vital nervous energy, 1
creasing strength and raising the vitality ,
the body to a high level. —Advt.

IN BANANA LAND
Died at Charleville this week one of
Bananaland’s oldest residents —Donald Gil-
lies. He was born in Invernesshire, and
after a lot of seafaring went ashore in South
Aus. in 1858. Shortly afterwards he decided
to move up to the sunshine, and, settling
dywn, he reared a family of 10. They, with
their mother, are left to battle with the
climate, which struck him down when he
was six months off a mere 100.
"Jonah”: Recently a deep-water steamer
loaded at one of our ports. While the job
was in progress an armed guard was on the
pier night and day, no Britisher being
allowed to come near without a permit. Now,
take a long breath. The wharfinger’s name
was Keinhamer and his assistant’s Bismarck.
‘‘F. Deed”: Some devout Bananalanders
have hatched out a new scheme for getting
the Lord’s work done. Every egg that the
fowls lay on Sunday is to be carefully put
by to be called for by the church secretary.
Evidently the fowls have heard of it, for
on a recent Sunday morning, when the rev.
gent, of a Rockhampton church was busy
preparing the ‘‘sacrea elements,” he came
across a fine plump Orpington comfortably
nestled on the communion-table. With a
little “shoo,” up jumps Mrs. Orp., leaving
behind her a brown egg as a thankoffering.
“Cato” : Randolph Bedfo: d ,(B. 22/11/’l7),
from the luxury of a seat in the Leg. Coun-
cil, spouts enthusiastically the praises of
“Ryan and his mates.” The new M.L.C. is
so enamored of the men who hung “Hon.”
in front of his name that his language is
that of a love-sick maiden for her hero. He
says Ryan and Co. are tl-e Australians
Ministering these times. It all depends upon
what “Australian” means. They have no
rivals for pride of place as good—nay even
the best —Australians if being Australian
means being unconcerned with the greatest
feature of our life to-day—the war. The
Cabinet has more concern for cheap chops
than for the great question of reinforcements.
The Empire’s necessity, summed up in The
Meat for Imperial Uses Act, has been em-
ployed to secure an advantage for the State
butcher-shops. No Minister has come for-
ward and urged the cause of reinforcements.
Conscription must not be mentioned within
a mile of their haunts. John Adamson paid
the price of his loyalty. No one with sense
gainsays that Ryan, Theodore and Fihelly
are strong men. Ryan is the ablest leader
in party politics in Australia to-day. A
party almost hopelessly divided over the
industrialist movement has to thank its lucky
stars it has Ryan. Without him Queens-
land Labor would have been hopelessly
bogged. The trouble with them is simply
Funk. The Government has settled a rail-
way strike by Funk. It is afraid of the
demands of the public servants. Simmering
discontent in the Southern railways is allayed
from time to time by compromises that are
only Funk. Its anti-Conscription is nothing
more nor less than Funk. The vote of the
A.W.U. is the powerful factor in Banana-
land’s politics. The Government moves in
terror of that vote. Its real masters are not
Parliament but the A.W.U. It is difficult to
understand how any democrat, such as
Bedford was, can find satisfaction in such
a position. Government of the people by
the people—where is it in Queensland to-
day? Where can it be when a Ministry
moves in terror of one small, well-organised
body of class voters?
“Coree” tells how Brisbane was planned :
There was deplorable lack of foresight when Bris-
bane was laid out; and as it expanded, the interests
of the land shark were more looked after than those
of the public. The result is that the city is now,
almost anywhere, a good imitation of a slum area.
The city was originally designed in the late ’3o’s
by Sir James Warner, who made provision for
streets 100 ft. wide. Governor Gipps of N. S. Wales,
of which Queensland was then a part, rejected the
plans, remarking that it was ridiculous to have
streets so wide in such a hot climate, and fixed them
at one chain. High buildings, he said, would pro-
tect the narrower streets from the sun, and also
form a sort of tunnel for cooling breezes. Apparently
LONG PAST THAT.
BOSS: “How is your little son getting on, Jacky—can he talk yet?”
J ACKY: “Talk! Cripe, Boss, him swearin’ now!”
it was Gipps who started the libel on Bananaland’s
climate.
Oxley passed up the Brisbane River in 1823, but
made no attempts at surveys until 1824, when he
traversed the Bremer River to Ipswich. Major Lock-
yer, of the 57th Regiment, in the following year
made the first complete survey of the Brisbane River,
and opened the way to the founders of Brisbane. It
was not, however, until 1839 that any plans for
settlement were made: in 1842 Henry Wade, Dixon
and Galloway commenced the surveys of Brisbane
proper. • Two of the principal features of that design
were a public reserve between Creek, Queen and
Eagle streets, and a water reserve between George,
Turbot and Ann streets. Both are now freehold in
several titles, and not fine public squares as the
planners intended.
Henry Wade had large ideas of town-planning, and
in 1843 he prepared a design of the area enclosed by
Queen-street and the river ; also of the area near the
south bank from Victoria Bridge to Kangaroo Point.
Along the north bank from the bridge to Petrie’s
Bight he proposed an esplanade ranging in width
from one and a half chains to three chains, and
on the south bank another esplanade three chains
wide from the bridge to Kangaroo Point. He called
it Stanley Quay. The north bank esplanade was,
however, wiped off the plan, and Stanley Quay was
shifted back four chains from the river and reduced
in width to one chain, and is now Stanley-street. The
land between the street and the river became free-
hold, to be for the most part later resumed by the
Government at a big cost for wharves and railway
access. The congestion there to-day is evidence of
how wise Wade was.
Another early town-planner, associated with
Warner and Wade, was the late J. C. Heusder, a
merchant in the late forties, who was instrumental
in getting the width of Queen-street increased to 120
links, and was largely responsible for the creation of
Magket-square. The City Bumbles now propose to
obliterate part of that with a Town Hall.
A feature of later and more demoralised surveys
was the inadequate railway approaches through the
double-track tunnels from Roma and' Brunswick
streets. Now to increase the approaches means
resuming some of the most valuable city properties
and undermining a cathedral.
Nevertheless, a map of Brisbane and suburbs still
shows numerous green patches varying in area from
five to 20 acres. They are referred to as parks, but
are very often council rubbish-tips and waste land.
The Botanical Garden is the only one worthy of the
name, and of the original 75 acres set aside, 20
acres have been cut out for Parliament House, the
Technical College and the University. The choicest
parts of the 200 acres of Victoria Park behind Spring
Hill have been cut out for the future University and
railway branch line and extensions, and the re-
mainder is too broken and rough for a goat pasture.
When an old-man flood of the ’93 type strikes the
congested area of South Brisbane, the time will be
ripe to think of shifting and doing some town-
planning elsewhere.
“W. 8.” : Although very near the 45 mark,
Alf Buchanan, editor of the Daily Mail,
made up his mind the other day that he
ought to be chasing the Hun. The recruit-
ing-officer, however, cast doubts on his
physical fitness, and he is now awaiting the
verdict of the P.M.O. Ilis brother Leslie,
editor of the Darling Downs Gazette, is
already in France.
“Cubbie”: The Bananaland Government,
by Order-in-Council, has prevented classified
public servants in receipt of £3OO a year
and over from asking the Arbitration Court
for increased pay ; and this is how it works
out. Railway draftsmen, at £3OO a year,
design locomotives which other men drive at
pay of over £320 plus privileges ; the guards
get up to £350 and uniform ; stationmasters,
in J:he South, to £325 and in the North to
£350. A railway deputation told Premier
Ryan the other day that ‘“in many cases
guards, engine-drivers and station-masters
were receiving more than traffic-managers.”
The incongruity is so marked that recently
a public servant in receipt of £3OO applied to
be reduced below that figure so that he
might have a chance to rise above it!
A Requiem.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I will not cry, but you have died to me.
And since no shroud axvaits the soul,
Let Dead Desire a weaver be!
For damp the grave and deep the hole
Where lies the casket for your soul.
I will not cry, but you have died to me.
And here I now erect a tomb
To mark the spot where once.... But see!
How mad it is to dwell in gloom
When you, my god, are in a tomb!
I will not cry that you have died to me.
But I will dance the Dance of Death,
And I will shout that I am free.
For deep I drank from your last breath
The ecstasy of Life in Death.
* * * *
Oh. rich with Life’s red wine at last
I leave the Garden of the Past
And strew red poppies side by side
Where you have lived, where you have died.

Brisbane, November 24.
My Dear Tiiabgomindah,—
Having returned from the
other frivolities of the South, theii
rolled up their sleeves, tied on the •
regal bowyangs, and a day or two
down to work. On Wednesday th/o* 0
ernor opened the Y.M.C.A. Hut n!\’ !'
Quay for Billjim. The following
was encored for a similar performance Vf
new ward at the Children’s Hospital &t a
The Hut is a joy. There was a ‘w
Ron on ednesday, prior to the o ffi3
breaking and entering. Mrs. T. Jr,
the State Commandant and his nice
and other law-abiding citizens graced th
proceedings, and were politely enthusiastic
over the musical menu that Gladvs P fn
served. m
It has dawned on some of our 2 0rir i
hearted people that the mercantile mariner
deserves a little more appreciation so a
piano and a billiard-table made’ their
appearance last week at the Seamen’s Mis-
sion- The piano was an anonvmous <dfp
the billiard-table came from the city rj
chants.
When the committee of inquiry into the
running of the refreshment-stall at the Exhi-
bition in aid of the Soldiers’ Residential
Club reported that “‘there had been mis-
management, but not greater than is usual
with patriotic and church movements”
a deafening chorus of protest went up. R
hasn’t subsided yet, but when it does I’ll
ask for a few balance-sheets and then we’ll
know.
The local Miss Inkyfingers is going
around with a tired smile. Last year some
of the fraternity got up an entertainment in
aid of the Soldiers’ Residential Club, and
raked in about £5O. At the official opening
of the club, not one of them was asked if she
would trot along —no; I’m wrong. At the
last hour one of them received a sort-of
invitation through the ’phone, which, of
course, she embraced !
The Musical Union gave an Elgar pro-
gramme on Tuesday—main items “The Music-
Makers” (Lena Hammond singing the con-
tralto solo) and "For the Fallen” (Ethel
Osborn, soloist). Both ladies were rewarded
with an armful of vegetation. Miss Ham-
mond sang from the interior of a shot-gold
taffeta gown, with a posy of black-velvet
flowers at the waist, and Miss Osborn was
upholstered in pale pink and lace.
Collectors are out for the benefit of
Heroes’ Day (December 1). This Saturday
lost-looking males wandered about with
boxes in their hands, begging contributions
in voices of surpassing meekness. Langley
Simmonds, who is the high priest of these
ceremonies, ordained that a covey of well-
known men should flap around in this way,
They seemed to be, oh, so happy! .
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.

Simple and Effective Methods.

I-ondon, Eng.
To Kill Hoots of Superfluous Hair.
Women annoyed with disfiguring growths
of superfluous hair wish to know not merely
how to temporarily remove the hair, but how
to kill the hair roots permanently. For this
purpose pure powdered pheminol may be
applied directly to the objectionable hair-
growth. The recommended treatment is
designed not only to instantly remove the
hair, but to actually kill the roots so that
the growth will not return. About an ounce
of pheminol, obtainable from the chemist,
should be sufficient.
Removing Her Skin.
The quickest and surest way to make a
good complexion out of a bad one is to
actually remove the thin veil of faded or dis-
colored outer skin from the face. This can
he done easily, safely and privately by any
woman. The process is one of gentle absorp-
tion.
Get some pure mercolised wax from your
chemist and apply it at night like cold cream,
washing it off in the morning. In a few
days the mercolide in the wax will have
absorbed the disfiguring cuticle, revealing
the fresh young skin underneath; you will
have a beautiful, clear, natural complexion.
The process is pleasant and harmless, making
the face look brilliantly attractive and youth-
ful. It also effectually removes such blem-
ishes as freckles, tan, moth patches, liver
spots, pimples, etc. Every woman should
keep a little mercolised wax on hand, as this
simple, old-fashioned remedy is the best eom-
plexioned beautifier and preserver known.
Blackheads Instantly Go.
A very simple, harmless and pleasant pro-
cess is now used to remove blackheads and
correct greasiness and large pores in the
skin. You have only to drop a tablet of
stymol, obtained from the chemist, into a
glass of hot water and bathe the face with
the liquid after the effervescence has sub-
sided- The blackheads Will then come right
off on the towel. The enlarged pores immedi-
ately contract to normal and the greasiness
disappears, leaving the skin smooth, soft and
cool and free from blemish. But to make sure
that this desirable result is permanent it is
advisable to repeat the treatment several
iimes at intervals of say about four or five
days.
Grey Hair Unnecessary.
One need not resort to the very question-
able expedient of hair dye in order not to
have grey hair. The grey hair can easily be
changed back to a natural color in a few
days’ time merely by the application of a
simple, old-fashioned and perfectly harmless
home-made lotion. Procure from your chem-
ist two ounces of tammalite concentrate and
mix it with three ounces of bay rum. Apply
this to the hair a few times with a small
sponge, and you will soon have the pleasure
of seeing your grey hair gradually darkening
to the desired shade. The lotion is pleasant,
not sticky or greasy, and does not injure the
hair in any way.
Naturally Wavy Hair.
Good stallax not only makes the best possi-
ble shampoo, but has the peculiar property of
leaving the hair with a pronounced natural
“wave,” an effect presumably desired by many
ladies. A teaspoonful of the stallax granules,
dissolved in a cup of hot water, is ample for
a luxurious head wash, and leaves the hair
with a peculiar lustre and flufllness obtainable
from nothing else as far as known. It is per-
fectly harmless, and can be obtained from
most chemists, although since it has been but
little used for this purpose it comes only in
lib. sealed original packages, enough to make
up 25 or 30 individual shampoos. [2

tralian interests, being a partner in
Antony Gibbs and Sous, which becomes
Gibbs, Bright and Co. in Australia. He
entered the office of Antony Gibbs in 1883
and managed the firm’s branches in Chile
(1886-1000). His mother was a Gibbs.
The memory of Fred. Holder, several-
times Premier of S. Aus. and first Speaker
of the Federal Reps., is to be kept green
in his own State Parliament House by a
portrait painting. George Webb is the
artist, and the picture is a gift from
Langdon Bonython, old friend of Holder
and himself one of the first M.H.R.’s.
“The Oldest Inhabitant” : That’s a pretty
story “Simon” tells (B. 15/11/’l7) about
“Wee Davie,” the unknown child who has a
monument in Waverley (Sydney) Cemetery.
But it is fiction. “Wee Davie” was my
three-year-old boy, who died at Heretord-
street, Glebe Point, 40 years ago, just after
the cemetery was opened ; and alongside him
I hope to rest my weary bones when the
time comes, in (say) 1940.
“Grantley,” from the West: —
The Bulletin' (11/10/’l?) was correct when it
stated that S. M. Rocke. of South Fremantle, was the
surprise packet of the W.A. elections. He won by
six votes as an Independent Laborite, beating Bolton,
who gave Labor best while away on active service.
Dunn, editor of Truth, was selected Labor candi-
date, but stood down when the heads at Fremantle
decided not to “officially” oppose any Khaki candi-
dates. Running for Perth, Dunn was beaten after
a wordy scrap. Rocke, who was a warder in Fre-
mantle Gaol and secretary of the South Fremantle
Labor organisation, got his three weeks’ annual
leave at the psychological moment, nominated as
Independent Labor, paid his own exes., and just
scraped in. A supporter, describing him, said: “He
says prayers very nicely.” Rocke is a Victorian. He
will sit with the Labor party in Opposition.
When you elect a body of foreign-traders
to win-the-war you can be quite sure they
won’t do it by encouraging Australian indus-
try. When the Federal Government pro-
hibited the importation of perfumes as
luxuries it simultaneously raised the excise
on Australian perfumes from 10s. to 15s. per
gallon. This looked fair enough; but the
other day the same Government relaxed the
prohibition to the extent of allowing the
entrance of half the quantity imported in
former years, so the local manufacturer finds
himself deeper in the soup than ever.
“It cost us less to build here to-day than
it would to have imported it before the war.
It was made in our own workshops of Aus-
tralian material, with the exception of part
of the motor chassis.” Thus Chief-Officer
Lee, of Melbourne’s Fire Brigade, concern-
ing a new extension ladder, one of the larg-
est in the world, which climbs up 89 feet
from the roadway and will carry six men
aloft. Even the go-slow policy, the high
cost of living and the difficulty of obtaining
raw material are of no avail against the
Protective policy enforced by the Hun sub-
marines.
“Lou” from his Observation Post: —
If the Vic. P.L.C. doesn’t soon wake up it will
get pushed off the track by the Socialist party. This
is the group that Tom Mann tried hard to boost into
prominence, but somehow it did not go in the desired
direction until Bob Ross took hold. Since then its
roll-call is about a thousand. Ross engaged Adela
Prankhurst and shifted the flag from an attic in
Elizabeth-street to the roomy and more convenient
Democratic Hall in Exhibition-street. Now it runs
Sunday-night concerts and lectures, employs perma-
nently Scott Bennett (who resigned from a State
seat up Ballarat way about 12 years ago) ; Joe
Sweblesses, secretary; Arthur Wallace, assistant sec. ;
Ross, editor Socialist; and three others. It keeps a
brass band, an orchestra and a grocery, and its latest
move is a Repertory Theatre. Last year the organi-
sation handled over £2OOO, while the P.L.C.’s in-
come was about £l5OO. The latter body seems to
have a fixed determination not to extend operations
beyond a Sunday-night meeting in the Gaiety
Theatre, with the result that advanced Laborites are
swelling the ranks of the opposition crowd.
Major Edward G. Clerk, fighting with the
South African Scottish, is a Queenslander
who has done good work. He went over to
Africa for the Boer trouble, and rose from
private to captain before the end. Then he
settled down in Maritzburg, and saw service
m the Zulu rebellion with Royston’s Horse.
His bravery at that time obtained recogni-
tion, and a wound secured him a pension of
114 a month. When the Kaiser set the
world afire Clerk was one of the first to
come forward, giving up his pension. He
helped to crush the rebellion, then went
through the German West Africa scrap, and
alter that joined up in Flanders. The latest
about him was that he had been severely
wounded.
“O. Darling’s” bitter memories:—
Mention by “Hugh” of lan Maclaren’s uncontrol-
lable Great Dane (B. 8/11/’l7) recalls my own
unhappy experience with one of the breed. Vera
and I were very nice to one another in those days,
and as \eras fa it hful Numa Pompilius escorted her
on many of her expeditions, I was also very nice to
Numa. The enormous animal was absolutely lamb-
like with Vera and would obey her slightest whim.
One afternoon, when I had a date with her in the
city, she brought Numa along on a leash. Vera
had to go and buy a few little things at an iron-
monger’s and would I please hold Numa while she
went in? Why, certainly, Sweetness! So off
went Vera, omitting to bid Numa be good and stay
put. Almost immediately, wrestling with Numa on
the kerb, I began to gather a crowd. Numa felt
that he was wanted inside the ironmongery shop,
which was also a crockery shop. In a few moments
he began to foam at the mouth in his efforts to
be gone, leaping up and down on his hind legs and
glaring wildly at the shop-entrance. The crowd
grew in volume and intensity and so did
the perspiration on my brow. At this stage, on the
outskirts of the concourse, I observed two shiny
helmets approaching and flung away the chance of
a lifetime in despair. I resignedly let the devoted
Numa tear himself away in one final plunge, and as
he bounded into the store I merged unobtrusively
with the crowd. Above the noise there came the
sudden sound of smashing crockery and general up-
heaval, after which I turned into a handy tavern to
reorganise my collar and tie. When Vera’s little
pet arrived, festooned with broken bedroom-ware
and trailing clouds of mousetraps, goodness knows
what Vera felt. I don’t, anyway, for we never met
again except as utter strangers.


STOPAIN
A BOON TO MOTHERS.
After much thought and experiment
we have at last succeeded in completing
what we believe is the most successful
treatment known for toothache. We
have placed it on the market under the
name of
STOPAIN
A Toothache Gum.
Besides being the latest and most
successful treatment for toothache,
Stopain is both simple and economical,
It is in the form of a gum and all you
have to do is to fill the cavity of the
tooth with it. It excludes the air and
stops toothache immediately.
No more burnt gums or blistered
tongues by liquid “cures” and this
alone means a lot to mothers.
Not only does Stopain relieve the pain,
but it also assists to preserve the tooth
until dental aid can be obtained, thus
making it invaluable to families in the
country who are often a day’s journey
from tiie nearest dentist.
Stopain is a boon to mothers. No
home should be without Stopain ; it is so
convenient and never fails to bring relief.
Stopain has been tried bv thousands of
people and we have never yet known it
to fail when used according to directions.
Get it now for you never know when it
may be needed.
Stopain is sold by most retailers at Is.
per box, but if yours hasn't got it in
stock it will be sent, to anv address
postage paid, upon receipt of price by

the ROM) TO COOD HEALTH
has been found by thousands of sufferers from stomach
and liver troubles.
They took Chamberlain’s Tablets for the stomach
and liver at the very first symptom and found that they
were the only remedy that would give them relief.
Every sick person should follow their example. They
are good for Headache, Costiveness. Sour Stomach,
Indigestion and Biliousness.
Why not start on the road to good health today with
CHAMBERLAINSIABLETS

BE PREPARED
Like many other dangerous maladies diarrhoea often comes on unexpectedly and frequently
before the patient is aware of it some serious disorder has developed. During the warm
weather attacks of this kind are very frequent and often so swift in their results that life is in danger before the physician
can be summoned.
Those who have the interests of their family at heart keep a bottle of Chamberlain s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy on
hand for immediate use in cases of this kind. It is without doubt the best medicine prepared for diarrhoea, dysentery and
other disorders of the bowels. If given at the first unusual looseness of the bowels the attack may be avoided but even in
advanced stages it is a quick and most effective remedy. ,
Never leave home without a bottle of Chamberlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy in your luggage. The excitement
incidental to travelling and change of water and food often bring on diarrhoea, colic and pains in the stomach for which
speedy relief must be obtained and Chamberlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy can always be relied upon to do this.

The Guard House in front
of Whitehall Palace was
originally built in 1641. The
present building was erect-
ed in 1751-3, and was used
as Headquarters by the
Secretary of State for War,
the Commander -in - Chief
and his Staff until 1872.
The Clock was famous for
its accuracy, and, in olden
times, was used as the
standard of time (as
Greenwich is now).

known particulars of famous places in the Heart of the Empire.
It is interesting to know that the War Office of to-day is situated
almost opposite the Horse Guards and has requisitioned huge supplies
of strong, enduring and dependable AVON TYRES ever since the
outbreak of war. And, although hundreds of Avon employees are
now in the firing line proving the “ mettle of their pasture,”
the supplies of Avon Tyres are fully maintained by their
comrades and are helping the Allies along the road to Victory.

THE woman who tries Bostock shoes for the first
time realises, as soon as her foot slides home,
that here is something different, something
easier and more flexible, than anything she
has yet dreamed of. Then, when she steps out in
them, what an exultant feeling she has of lightness,
buoyancy and freedom. On the top of this, too, there
is that delightful confidence and assurance that come
of being well-dressed and knowing it. For Bostock
shoes are always designed with one eye on the
fashions of the day and one eye on the ultimate sat-
isfaction of the wearer. The result is shoes so well
fitting and so easy, that they feel just like one’s best-
loved old pair, yet so dainty, so original, so
thoroughly well-made that they look and, after quite
a lot of wear, continue to look the rfewest and smart-
est things imaginable.

The Inky Way
“Y.Z.”: My friend Goe is on the press.
For years, besides doing his ordinary jobs, he
has conducted a more or less frivolous column
in mildly jocund prose and rhyme, invari-
ably falling back upon the weather when
other subjects failed. He estimates that in 15
years he has earned £3OO by paragraphs and
verse dealing with familiar astronomical
variations. Being free for a day recently,
and having co-operated with a number of
friends for a motor picnic in the country,
Goe arose to find a grey, cold day, and the
rain tumbling down with dreary insistence.
The disgusted pressman cut loose. “When
I think of all I have written about the
beastly climate of this country,” said he,
“and then contemplate a day like this, I
simply despair of the power of the press!”
Yegetable-eating insects have been terribly
plentiful in Tassy this year, and the Hobart
bookseller who advertised C. J. Dennis’s
latest achievement as “The Slugs of Gosh”
probably had the kitchen-garden on his mind
at the moment.
“Robert Brothers”: Another Australian
Inky Wayfarer to pay the great price •is
F. J. Griffin, wounded to death while fight-
ing Avith South Africans in Flanders. He
arrived in Durban four years ago and joined
the Natal Witness, where he did good and
strenuous work till he followed the colors.
Griffin had a big heart but a poor physique.
He had been turned down by the recruiting-
officers, but after six months he made another
attempt and secured his uniform. He fell
in his first battle.

Harrie Nowland writes that she never
claimed to be the first presswoman in Aus-
tralia to do gallery notes in Parliament.
“For aught that I know, there previously
may have been others, but there is no chance
of error attached to the publication of the
statement that I, who, by the way, am only
a Queenslander by adoption, was the first
in this Northern State.”
Andrew Frederick Laurie and John
Watson, proprietors of the Border Watch,
of Mt. Gambier (S.A.), have been in part-
nership for 54 years. They are both still
young men, the former 76 and the latter
but seven years older. Watson landed in
Melbourne in ’57, and Laurie was born at
sea when the ship which was bringing his
parents to the new land was in sight of
Portland Bay (Vic.).
Mrs. R. V. Kearney : I’m glad to see that
Miss Shirley and Miss Nowland were offi-
cially accorded the right to chairs in the
Bananaland Parliament’s press gallery.
Nearly 20 years ago I was in the habit of
regularly taking notes in the N.S.W.
Ladies’ Gallery, and the late Emily Soldene
frequently did the same at that time. Per-
haps because we were both personally well
known to the politicians of the day, no one
ever questioned our right. But some 15
years ago I essayed to do the same thing in
the Westralian Ladies’ Gallery, and within 20
minutes a very large and imposing Sergeant-
at-Arms came to inquire what it was I held
in my right hand and to deny my right to
do anything on the premises except listen.
After a chat he advised me to at once apply
to the Speaker (George Lee Steere) through
the Clerk of Parliaments for permission
to take notes in the press gallery. A note
in reply from Mr. Lee Steere led to an
interview, in which I was informed in diplo-
matic language that the Speaker would not
object to my taking notes in the Ladies’
Gallery providing I did not let him actually
see me so engaged.

“Bram”: Did The Bulletin tremble on
the morning of April 7, 1894? Amongst my
old papers is a file of the New Order, and
on the day mentioned the rag was born. On
the front page is a cartoon, by Monty Scott,
wherein “Hop,” of The Bulletin (wearing
a top hat, by the way), is engaged in white-
washing G. R. Dibbs. W. M. Hughes and
Holman were the staff. It is perfectly
shocking to read their thoughts in those
days, and their allusions to the established
gods show a lack of consideration which I
rejoice to see they have both repented of.
The paper lived for only 23 numbers. It
was published on the second floor of Kid-
man’s Buildings, George and Market streets,
and had a hilarious life. Hughes some years
ago in Copy, issued by the A.J.A.. gave an
account of the rise and fall of the New
Order. Their principal poet was Desmond.
“When anything had to be said that could
not be safely said in prose, it was entrusted
to Desmond.” The occasional poet was
Holman. “To see that gifted man sit-
ting on a box whacking out poetry on a
hired typewriter (that might at any moment
be seized by the myrmidons of Capital) was
a sight for the gods !”
INSPIRATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The poet searched the depth of night, and saw
A star of rapture and of wistful awe;
Low in the western sky she set her throne,
And ruled in spectral stateliness alone.
So great her glory, yet so chaste her beam,
His soul took heat of her. There came a dream
Of wonder-beauty weaving into words
That sang about him like impassioned birds.
He wrote his song with all his blood, while, seen
Through flow of vines and dip of frond, the Queen
Of Night expanded, and with silver aureoled
Flamed now to crimson, now to burnished gold.
He set the throbbing universe to song,
The sweep of God from darkness, and the long
Grey dawn ere love and fruitfulness took light,
And with eternal roses sowed the night.
He read again his song when came the morn,
And knew a deathless thing of him was born ;
But saw, e’en while exulting o’er the lines, :
His star, a scrap of tinsel in the vines!

This is the wonderful
Re-creation Instrument
The NEW EDISON
This is the instrument that music-lovers are installing in their homes;
it embodies a new art, that of actual Re-creation of all forms of music,
and is vastly superior to ordinary talking-machines.
Get one for YOUR Home
this Christmas.
It will delight your wife; it will teach the children exactly what really good
music is like, and encourage them to seek the best in music; it will
entertain your friends. They will enjoy with you the clear, sweet
natural tone, which cannot be distinguished from the original rendering.
Madame Marie Rappold, prima-donna soprano of the Metropolitan Opera
Company, is one of many to make an actual Tone Test in comparison
with The NEW EDISON. Commenting on it, one writer stated: “The
golden notes pouring from her (Marie Rappold’s) throat blended per-
fectly with their Re-creation by The NEW EDISON. It was impossible
for those present to distinguish her living voice from its Re-creation.”

To carry a crew in the teeth of a

Swing her to lee’ard, heave ho, and abaft,
Then run up the mizzen and reef in the

In our stealthy black lugger with skull

“Full speed” is the order, “her nose to the

And drops his best alley-tor into my lap ;

The Spaniard we’ll ram as she runs for

And I am the bride wno was stolen for

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WALTER ROSSITTER listened to
the Maorilander’s story of the mur-
der of his mate by aboriginals
whom they had trained to work with me mods
of easy, almost flabby, kindness. These, to
the blackfellows’ mind, established fear; or,
at least, a softness incapable of self-defence.
That, to the furtive man, is temptation ines-
capable ; weakness, unpreparedness, trustful-
ness invite the aggression of the coward as
a sick man invites flies.
‘Tie came from Auckland with me,” said
Harney, still white-faced and drawn with tne
anguish of losing a good mate by murder
that seemed without purpose. “And what
I’m to tell his people I don’t know. I’ve
put off writing until I can say the mur-
derers are punished ; and God knows when
that will be! We haven’t a trace of them.”
“You’ll never see hair or hide of the nig-
ger that did it if you don’t get a tracker on,”
replied Walter Rossitter, whom a trip to the
Straits at the end of the muster now left at
Russell River, 000 miles north and east of
his own to.uri by Mount Remarkable.
“We haven’t any,” said Harney, help-
lessly. “After the murder the other boys
cleared out from poor Harrison’s camp as
well as the actual killers, so we don’t know
which were the murderers.”
“They all thought they’d be accused, and
so they went bush —quite natural! But if
you'd had a tracker on quickly he would
have come up with some of them, and the first
one you pinched would have trained your
gun for you on the real Mackay.”
“I wouldn’t take life,” replied Harney.
“That’s the business of the law. As it is',
we’ve sent for the police.”
“The police are a fine lot of chaps,” said
Rossitter, “but they’ve got to move in a
mysterious way their wonders to perform;
and that mysterious way is slower than the
way of the man who can get a flying start.
Why didn’t you get to it at once?”
“You’ve got methods in Australia the
Maorilander never thinks of using with
natives.”
“It’s all the difference between an island
and a continent,” said Rossitter. “And
then, too, the Maori fought you to a stand-
still and therefore you respect him. Now, the
old hands in Australia always had the dice
loaded against the nig.; and because they
licked him—often as the coward gives a mor-
tal blow to the brave man —they despise
him.”
“Don’t you?”
“I don’t. The best of him has all the
makings of genius—a free soul, a sense of
humor, and observation that never makes a
mistake. Your Maori is a born soldier ; and
few soldiers feed themselves. That way
they’re most helpless. Now, Australia isn’t
a rich, droughtless country like Maoriland,
with food ready for the taking, mostly, and it
never had any Captain Cook to intro-
duce new diet in the way of pigs. The
Australian has to scratch for his living;
all his fighting is for his food and his own
preservation; and he was perfectly equipped
for that until the white man came along
with a gun and rum, and the Pongs brought
opium charcoal to finish him off._ The worst
of him is his likeness to criminal white men
—unable to beat any impulse. And, for
that, white men who ‘go bush’ take the risks,
and must take the law in their own hands.”
“It’s training, I suppose,” said Harney,
with something like helplessness. “But it
never occurred to me. to track the killers and
shoot them, though I want revenge for my
poor mate. But it seemed the natural thing
to hand over the job to the police, and sit
down to wait for the law.”
“How was he found?”
“Dead —pinned by a spear to the soft cedar
of a box flume he was building to bring water
on to the alluvial terraces near his camp.
He’d scratched up the ground around him
with his finger-nails, poor old Dick!”
“What boys had he?”
“There was one bringing in the timber,
and two with cane-knives and picks cutting
the channel for the race through the scrub.”
“What boys were they?”
“All scrub boys—Koranda, Bandicoot and
Alligator.”
“He treated them well? But of course he
did !”
“We treat all our nigs, too well”
“Joke with them, too, eh? That’s bad!
For all low-class whites and ’most all nig-
gers. Did he have any particular sort of
stores they’d hanker after?”
“Only the usual camp stuff —and a lot of
canned tucker.”
“Clothes?”
“Just about ordinary.”
“What you think ordinary might be an
extraordinary temptation to a nig. What
about riding out to his camp?”
“All right,” replied Harney. Then, as if
he didn’t like the job: “It hurts to see the
place since I found my poor mate and buried
him. But I’ll pilot you there.”
* * * *
Over “potato furrows,” through jungle,
saturated with the almost ceaseless rain,
Harney and Walter Rossitter rode towards
the high, moist shadows that hid Bellenden
Ker. The depression of the saturated jungle
settled down on Harney. In the hours of the
slow slipping of the horses over the potato
furrows he said no word except to point out
listlessly the scars in the clay at the head
of the race—scars which the bush was rapidly
covering with a new skin of green. Then
at half a mile from the dead man’s old camp
Rossitter saw the spider legs of the box
flume where the race crossed a gully—the
idle water dripping from the joints of the
cedar boards.
At the farther end of the gully Harney
stopped where the flume entered the ground-
race, as the gully rose to the level again.
The rock showed in places where the sand
had been torn away as with a garden fork
—the marks of the despairing fingers of the
white man struggling to tear his body from
its impalement on the spear fixed in the cedar
of the flume.
“Poor Dick!” said Ilarney for the tenth
time. “My poor mate!”
“Let’s get the nig. who did it,”said Walter
Rossitter. “You’ll feel better then.”
They rode on to the camp.
It was deserted ; the partially-fastened en-
trance-flap drifted idly in the rainy wind;
a . prospecting dish flashed back wate’ry
glimpses of the sun. Within was disorder —
cases opened and boxes smashed by blows
of a pick; a sluggish stream of molasses
from a can pierced by a pick-point spread
upon the earth; a plug of white man’s to-
bacco, a corner bitten off by strong teeth,
lay on the sleeping place ; a biscuit broken
by a naked foot and crushed into the mud
near the fore-pole.
“See what’s missing,” said Walter JRossit-
ter. “You knew the stores your male had,
I suppose.”
“Yes, I knew. But it’s little use now five
days after his death.”
“You never know. If you tell me what’s
missing we’re a point nearer finding the man
who did it—unless he’s eaten most of the
evidence by this time.”
Ilarney lost his listlessness at the sugges-
tion of even preliminary action. As the
stock-taking proceeded be became almost
energetic.
“The stores were delivered the day before
the killing,” he said.
“Strong evidence in favor of the killing
being done to get the stores.”
“Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen —nine tins of
corn-beef and curried-mutton missing. Six-
teen tins of kippered-herring gone.”
“Now we’re getting to it.”
“About three pounds of Derby tobacco
gone.”
“White man’s tobacco. A flash nig. could
cut a big swathe with that.”
“Dick had a lot of silk handkerchiefs —all
gone.”
“Colored, of course?”
“Yes, red. Two Crimean shirts missing.
All the jam gone.”
“What jam—-strawberry?”
“Yes—but how did you know that?”
“Strawberry, black currant, lemon and
melon —most nigs, would sell a man’s life for
that. Most nigs., I mean, unless they like
the man the stuff belongs to.”
He looked up suddenly, as the grey air
became darkened at the tent-flap, and he saw
the head of a black man —a comically ugly
black, with eyes bright and roving as a
bird’s; face held on one side as if it would
help the upward twist of the broken nose ;
the face of a comedian, but a comedian in
trouble.
“What name this one?” asked Rossitter,
and Harney replied: “That one Monkey—
good boy that. He’s been working at my
camp where we were this morning; and he
used to camp half-way between there and
here. What’s up, monkey?”
“I bein’ crooked inside altogether,” replied
Monkey, his air of woe making him appear a
finer comedian than before. “My gin been
camp longa’ me —I go away three-feller day
alonga you. When come back altogether
clear out that one. Track been come this
way.”
“Lubra belonga you go bush ’longa other
fellow?” asked Rossitter.
“Altogether too much walk about that
one,” said the deserted husband. “That
one been wantem white Mary clothes,
wantem trorbry jam, wantem tin pish—all
that one”
“Ha ! Ha !” interrupted Harney. “She
has done it!”
“Not on your life.” said Walter Rossitter.
“She might have been the cause of it; and
she’s probably sharing the spoil. Don’t
move about, Harney. Let Monkey pick up
the tracks here.”
Monkey knelt over the now-blurred and
confused book of the bush, its print marred
and partly obliterated, line over line, sen-
tence confounding sentence. He picked up
the meaning laboriously, here the impression
of a heel, here of a toe, there of the ball of
a foot, blurred by the white men’s boots,
spelling out the full signature of the foot as
a white man might unravel a cryptogram by
determining the cypher of E.
He settled the track signature of the man
who had looted the tent; ran outside; and,
abandoning the examination of the clearing
without the tent —where the white men had
walked about discussing the murder, and
horses had destroyed the document by stamp-
ing one puddle out of shape and so making
another —he went to the far side of the

WEEK in, week out, there is the ever-present
risk of accident at home as well as in the
workshop. Hence it is necessary to have
Zam=Buk handy for the safe and speedy healing 0 f
every kind of superficial injury, More accidents
occur in the home than anywhere
else. This fact drives home very
forcibly the necessity of always
having within reach a handy pot of
Zam=Buk, which can be depended
upon better than anything else, not
only to swiftly soothe away the first
pain of a cut, bruise, sprain, burn or
scald, but also to keep the broken skin
free from infection by dirt and disease
and make it heal up quickly and natu-
rally. There is a soothing, healing and
antiseptic power concentrated within
Zam-Buk, the like of which has never
been known before.
EVERY HOME NEEDS ZAM-BUK.
Zam-Buk is invalu-
able for eczema,
bad legs, ringworm,
sores, ulcers, cuts,
burns, bruises,
bites, sprains, itch,
wounds, old sores,
abscesses, barcoo
rot, sunburn and
injured & diseased
conditions of the
skin. Sold by all
Chemists & Stores
at 1/6 and 3/6 per
pot. Always keep a
pot handy for the
accidents that WILL
happen.
A Mother’s Praise for Zam-BuK.
“As a general household healing halm for every-day
mishaps I have found Zam-Buk unequalled,” says Mrs.
E. Larcombe, a resident of 515 Riley Street, Surry Hills,
Sydney.
“Cuts, bruises, knocks, wounds, abrasions and festering
sores are practically daily occurrences among my children,
but a few applications of Zam-Buk soon heals their skin
and makes their sores well.
“My little girl was bitten by 7 some insect. The part
began to itch, and she scratched it, with the result that
the tiny bite of an insect developed into a nasty, festering
sore. I applied Zam-Buk, and after a few dressings the
sore went completely away.”

clearing and prospected the outer edge of
its ring.
They watched him stop at the point most
distant from the tent and he stiffened in the
discovery of that he sought and seemed to
grow taller with victory.
"He’s got it, Harney. What is it,
Monkey?”
"Two feller boy wait longa there. One
feller boy longa my gin catchem plenty
tucker longa tent. Then all feller go that
away.”
He pointed to the clouds that swaddled
Bellenden Iver.
“Which boy come to the tent with your
gin? Koranda, Bandicoot or Alligator?”
“No been knowem that one. Been knowem
track alonga my gin. I been go after that
one.”
He took his spear which he had rested
against the tent, with his scrub-knife of
murderous appearance—not a billhook, not
a cane-knife, not a battle-axe, but something
of all three.
“You no kill that one,” said the law-abiding
Maorilander, warninglv. “You find him;
then tell me; then I tell trooper.”
The black comedian became tremendously
impressive. He read a sermon to Harney,
until Harney felt ashamed of himself as a
heathen.
“Marmi!” said Monkey, appealing directly
to Walter Rossitter, knowing, with the quick
observation of the aboriginal, that here was
the leader and the master, “One feller boy
longa this place no good. Mitter Dick good
feller —givem all feller boy t’bacca, givem
jam, givem tin dog that one; that feller boy
been spearem Mitter Dick. Killem that one.
White man all right—black feller no good.

S’pose I findem I been killem that one boy—
then him no been killem white man no more
altogether.”
Thus far he had spoken with great earnest-
ness and seeming purity of motive. He had
been judicial as the law, which is cold and
unrevengeful even when hanging the mur-
derer. But now he concluded with a state-
ment of the personal motive.
“Altogether been bad feller that one,”
repeated Monkey. “Killem white feller —
stealem my gin!”
“You mustn’t kill him, Monkey.”
“Let him go,” said Rossitter. “He’s on
private as well as official business. Go on,
Monkey. Good luck !”
“All right that one,” replied the comedian.
“I go quick feller.”
He took the spear in his right hand and
the scrub-knife in his left, gave a final look
at the opening sentence of the track, and
disappeared in the wall of jungle.
“My time’s up,” said Walter Rossitter
three days later. “I’ll have to quit to-
morrow.”
“I’m sorry,” said Harney. “I’ve got the
blues all right. I wouldn’t feel so bad if I
had my poor mate’s murderer under lock and
key.”
“Monkey will account for him, if I know
Monkey’s thoughts.”
And when Monkey returned that night,
with a gin who was very sore with a beating
and very submissive to her husband, they
knew that Monkey had accounted.
The white men went to Monkey’s camp,
and found it newly furnished and illumin-
ated. In his ragged tent under a bark wurly
sat Monkey at his ease and in glory. He
had even a lantern, of a bottomless beer
bottle, a candle burning in the neck thereof.
“H’lo, Monkey. You find ’em that feller
killem Mister Dick?”
. “Yowi, find ’em.”
“Which one?”
“Koranda.”
“How did you know that?” asked the
Maorilander.
Monkey gestured contempt. “That one
Koranda I findem longa my gin.”
He half-turned to where she sat behind
him in the shadow, and the gin shrank like
a beaten dog.
“Why did the other fellers run away,
too?”
“Altogether frikened. Arpeter I been
killem Koranda they been run away again.”
“How you killem?”
“I been think it no good catchem three
feller one time, spos’em been killem me! I
been say longa Koranda: ‘You good feller
boy. I no been wantem that one gin—you
been tak’em.’ Then Koranda he say: ‘My
word! Good feller you—l give trorbry
jam!’ Trorbry jam!—that make this one
gin along me run away longa Koranda! I
been eatem trorbry jam, he givem me two
feller hankcheap, plenty Derby t’bacca —no
been givem tin pish. Then he been say he
gettem work cuttem track longa miner feller
—he askit me been work longa him. ‘Sun
he come up I go longa him longa scrub. We
been cuttem track —scrub-knife gettem plenty
not sharp that one. Miner feller sendem
grindstone makem knife sharp. Then
Koranda been turnem grindstone; I been
sharpen ’em scrub-knife good feller.’ Then I
been show Koranda little feller stump longa
track. I been say ‘More better cuttem off
stump so horse no been catch him foot!’
Koranda sit down cuttem off stump. Then
I been liftem cane-knife hittem strong
''feller”
“My God ! Killed him!” said the Maori-
lander, horrified.
- “Cut him head off altogether close up,”
replied Monkey, placidly. “Then him been
cry. ‘You no killem me?’ Then I been say,
‘Ah! bad feller. You no killem white man
no more!’ Him been cry strong feller; I
been takem sipear—not sipear belongem me,
sipear belongem Bandicoot, so white man
been think Bandicoot do that one.”
. “Machiavelli! By God !”
“What name that one? I been pushem
sipear through that one feller neck, then
Koranda die —quick feller—tearem up grass
longa finger. Then him bin say, ‘Guggle
guggle’ longa neck, then altogether finish.
Bad feller! No been killem white man no
more altogether.”
“Justice is done, anyhow,” said Harney
“Monkey wouldn’t see a white man killed.”
Walter Rossitter laughed at his own better
knowledge.
“Monkey.” he said, “you knowem that
one Justice?”
“Justus! What name that one?” de-
manded Monkey. “Arpeter I been killem
Koranda I gettem” He paused and
breathed heavily at the itemisation of the
spoils to the victor —“I getem two feller
red hankcheap, three feller trorbry jam,
plenty Derby t’bacca, my word. This one
feller gin”
"Is that all. Monkey?”
Monkey swelled with the wonder of it all
-—towered like little Julius Caesar returned
from Gaul and entering Rome with captive
kings at his chariot-wheels and the golden
nakedness of the dancing-girls going on
before. He held up a tin of kippered herring
and cried in triumph :
“Two feller tin pish!”
RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
A Wayside Idyll.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SHE was a dainty little wisp of a girl,
and the coarse working clothes could
not hide the neat, slender lines of
her figure, nor could the untidy hair conceal
the piquant face and mischievous eyes of
her. She was hoeing a field of turnips, and
Bill the Digger, passing by with full pack
up, and looking like a cdothes-peg for the
hanging of his multitudinous gas-helmets,
etc., stopped and smiled. What else could
any digger do? .
"Bonjour, Monsieur,” she said in friendly
fashion.
Bill’s French was limited, and he was
accustomed to dole it out in niggardly
fashion on these occasions so as to prolong
the conversation as much as possible. But
this was a special occasion and he rashly
bankrupted himself at once.
“Bonjour, Mademoiselle —fait beau
temps —eight o’clock feenee—napoo —pro-
menade ce soir!” he said in one breath.
She laughed merrily—oh, she was a
roguish little lady. “No promenade,” she
said. “Apres la guerre, oui.”
“Apres la guerre finit,
Soldat Anglais parti,”
trolled Bill, in the words of the familiar
ditty.
“Deux souvenirs en Armentieres,
No bally bon for me,”
she concluded for him, smiling more roguishly
than ever.
Bill was enchanted. Clearly a regular
introduction must be effected. “Bill,” he
said, pointing to himself. “Compree Bill?'’
“Beel!” she repeated adorably. “Moi, je
suis Jeanne!”
“’Shun?’ mused Bill. “Sounds like par-
ade. Well, Shun, I jerry to your name and
you jerry to mine, see? So we’re set —•
compree set! Promenade now, Shun —
mantnong—toot sweet!” he pleaded.
Jeanne looked at her unhoed turnips and
looked at Bill —a big, brown, comely chap,
Bill, and a terrible way with him. “Oui,
Beel,” she said softly.
They walked along the dusty white road
together. Presently Bill unshipped his pack
on the side of the road and they sat on it.
A pack is too small for two people to sit on
ordinarily, but not when those two people are
Bill and Jeanne, compree? Bill soon tiring
of repeating his small stock of French, they
discovered a new and wonderful method of
communication —a sort of labial Esperanto,
which just came to them, somehow.
“Je vous aime, Beel,” she whispered.
“You’ll do me, Shun!” he told her hap-
pily.
Irreverent soldiers, passing by, hailed
them. “You’re doin’ no harm, digger,” they
called. “Any show of puttin’ in a cobber?”
“Silly cows!’’ commented Bill contemptu-
ously, and thereafter ignored them.
Bill told her, with the aid of many signs,
that he was a cow-puncher from Taranaki
—“compree cow-puncher?” (gestures illus-
trative of milking a cow).
“Vaehier!” she suggested.
“Oui!” said Bill delightedly. “Milkay un
Vash !”
“Fiancee en Nouvelle Zelande?” she asked
fearfully.
“Nong!” (indignantly). “You’re my tart
—compree tart?” (Movements illustrative
of being one’s tart.)
Jeanne, told him she was a “fermiere —
travailler aux champs—on ferme—compree?”
“Dam shame!” said Bill.
The afternoon wore away.
* * * *
Bill looked at his watch and started.
“Gotter imshi,” he said ruefully. “On the
mat if I don’t. But I want to see y’ again
• —revore, compree?”
“Revoir,” she acquiesced.
“Demang sank hur?” asked Bill.
“Oui, demain a cinq heures. Beel,” she
agreed. “Au revoir, Beel —adieu !”
“Orevore—ajoo !” said Bill.
* * * #
Bill put dow r n his oil-sheet on the stone
floor of the billet that night, took off his
boots, and, having thus prepared for “bed,”
pulled his blankets over him.
“Met a fine little tabby this afternoon,” he
told his cobber, confidentially.
‘Didger ?” said the cobber, without in-
terest.
“Yes,” said Bill. “She’ll do me!”
“She’ll do me!” he repeated drowsily a
few minutes afterwards, as he sank to sleep.

Heart’s Desire.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN my true love walks with me
Through the fields of Fantasy,
All in rosy scented fire
Dance the elves of Heart’s Desire;
And the fairy moon and white
Drops the laughter of Delight,
While the leaves and branches sing
In my sweet imagining;
And the wee folk, two and two,
Kiss me with their kirtles blue.
Oh, I lilt with them along
To the measure of their song,
And I sip the curds and wine
That they serve beneath the vine,
With a moonbeam dipped in dew
And the star-spice running through ;
Till a spell begins to spin
All the charms of Elfland in.
When my true love walks with me
Through the fields of Fantasy.

SOMETHING
BETTER!
If Engineers and Steam-plant Owners would only
realise the importance of EFFICIENTLY insulating
their Boilers, Steam Pipes, etc., more attention might
be paid to this particular matter. Great economies
can be effected in this direction, in some cases the coal
consumption being reduced as much as 50%. But the
insulating material must be of the very best.
Carbonate of Magnesia is to-day recognised as the best
non-conductor of heat. Newall’s Coverings are com-
posed of 85% of this material, and 15% Asbestos—the
Asbestos being used for binding purposes only— and in
addition possess innumejfcle advantages over all other
forms of lagging. Newals Coverings are used, practi-
cally exclusively, by the British Admiralty, N.S.W.
and Victorian Governments, and have been used
throughout the Ultimo, White Bay, Melbourne, Perth
and Canberra Power Stations.
