CHASING SHADOWS.
IT was night, but a night almost as bright
as day. The moon had .risen round
and full, turning commonplace to romance;
even the brown, fallen leaves looked pic-
turesque ; and up ip the heavens a few soft,
snowy clouds floated about in contrast with the
sky. ,
But none of this Em saw. She went across the
green towardthe house, crying.
“Ted’s been jumping on my head all the night
and crushing it to pieces,” she said sobbingly to
her eldest sister.
“Jumping on your head !” exclaimed Nell.
“ Yes ; no matter how I bobbed about he
bobbed quicker and stamped on it and squashed
it.”
“ How silly you children are—the idea of crying
because one treads on the other’s shadow ! Go
back and tread on his.”
“I can’t,” Em answered, still crying dismally,
“ I’ve tried—he’s too quick for me.”
“ Try again—there’s nothing like trying again,”
Nell said. The tone was cheerful, and Em, drying
her eyes, brightened up and went out. But soon
she came back.
“I can’t,” she wailed, “I can’t at all. Just
when I think I’m smashing it he’s sitting down
with his head under him, an’ if I run up to him to
try and get at it, he jumps up straight, and his
head shoots right aw-, aw-, away ! ”
“ What’s the matter?” the mother asked, coming
into the room.
“ Ted’s been jumping on me head,” Em said.
“ What!”
“ Ted’s been jumping on me head ! ”
“ Juinping on your head ! Where is he ? Come
here—let me see.”
“Not this head,” Em said ; “ me other head—
the one that runs along the ground when I go
into the moonlight.”
Nell burst out laughing, and explained.
The mother laughed too, but Em stood glum
and wondered what it was that amused them. To
her the case was serious ; what Ted had done had
wounded her as if he actually had trodden on her
head. She turned to go: but her mother hid her
smiles, and called her back.
“Remember, dear, that you are weaker than
Nan and Ted ; consequently you can’t expect to
fight them with their own weapons—you must
plot a little.”
“They have n’t got any weapons,’’Em answered.
“We were all playing jumping on moonlight
heads, an’ Ted’s been jumping on mine all night,
an’ I can’t catch anybody’s.”
* ‘Don’t cry, dear, ” her mother said comfortingly,
taking her on her lap. “Just sit about and wait.
They’ll think you ’re not playing then, and some
of them are sure to come near you, then you can
jump up and give them a woeful time.”
Em thought this was a good idea, and slid
down and out. Going to the shed, she 1 emptied
out the smallest hen’s nest and took the
box. Dragging it across, she placed it on the
outskirts of their playground and sat down, pre-
tending to be tired and uninterested in the
game. Presently Ted and Harry walked toward
her, seemingly spent and wanting a rest. Their
shadows fell out in front, and, watching
eagerly, Em got ready for a spring. Now they
were close, and, jumping quickly up, she had
stamped on both several times before they had
taken in what she was doing.
“ Hooray !” shouted Nan, who had seen; “go
it, Em.”
But . Ted and Harry, boiling with humiliation,
were in in hot pursuit of the offender, who,
happy at last, raced madly for the house. It was
a close race, but Em won.
TICKLING FEET.
PRESENTLY the other children went home,
and Nan and Ted came in.
Em was in bed.
“You tickle my foot and I’ll tickle
yours, ” she said, as Nan entered.
“Alright.”
Nan hurriedly undressed and got into bed, and
Em began to tickle her foot, Nan insisting
that hers should be done first.
“One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
nine, ten ” '
“That’s too fast,” Nan said,-“they’re not
seconds. This is the way you ought to count:
One -- - two -- - three -- - four ---five , and
keep tickling all the time ; you keep leaving off.”
“’Tis not,” Em said, “ the clock does n’t tick
that slow. You only want me to tickle your foot
more than five minutes, but I won’t.”
“I ought to be counting while you tickle,” Nan
said.
“ You ought not,” snapped Em, “ you count
too slow.”
“ And you count too fast.”
“Well, let Ted count. Ted ! Ted ! come and
count while I tickle Nan’s foot.”
Ted came in.
“You ’re pulling all the blankets off me,” Em
cried, tugging at the bedclothes.
Nan felt to see if this was the ease. “You
fibber, I’m not. They ’re hanging nearly to the
floor on your side. I’ve got scarcely any.”
“Well, you’ve got all the sheet then.”
“ Yes, and that’s all I have got. ”
“If you don’t stop snarling I won’t count,”
Ted put in. “An’ you ’ll have to tickle both my
feet for counting. You can have one each, that ’ll
get it over at the same time.”
“ Who ’ll count ?” Em asked.
“I will, of course,” answered Ted.
“No you won’t,” they both cried; “the one
that’s getting their foot tickled always counts too
■slow.”
“ And the one that’s tickling always counts too
But I’ll be getting both of mine tickled,
and Nell says two negertives makes one’firmative.
That brings it right, does n’t it ? ”
The two girls thought a bit, and agpeed.
“ Make haste, then. Go on tickling, Em. And
you count, Ted. We’ll do yours last so’s to be
sure you ’ll count all the time. If we don’t be
quick we won’t get them done before Mother
comes in to see if we ’re asleep.”
“I’ll sing out‘yes,’” Ted said, “that’ll fix it
up G
Em began to tickle and Ted to count, and Nan
closed her eyes and lay back in the height of bliss.
But when the five minutes were up, either by
accident or design Nan was sound asleep.
“Nan! Nan!” Em said, “that’s all, you’ve
got to tickle mine now.”
Nan began to snore.
. “Nan!” Em called loudly, “wake up and
tickle my foot.”
But Nan snored even more loudly than before.
Em shook her. It was no use; Nan was in
dreamland. Now she began to talk. “ Era’s got a
turn-up nose. Hang a pot on it, did you say ?”
1! h a Y e n’t got a turnip nose,” Em shouted.
“ Eyes like a guinea-pig— a few flaxen tresses
sticking to her head ? ” Nan continued.
Em shook her furiously.
“I haven’t got them things sticking to me
head.”
Nan was still in dreamland. “Did you say
ears like a donkey ?”
“I have not,” Em said, now on the verge of
tears.
“ What’s that, Harry ? ” Nan Continued. “ Ted
can’t fire straight out of a catapult. You killed
six leatherheads in the fruit trees and Ted killed
none? Duffer, did you say^”
Ted was up like a shot. “ Here, you ’re not going
to go dreaming about me—l’ll wake her, Era.”
And putting his hand under the bedclothes he
pinched her toe —as he thought; but a shrill
screech rang out, arid Em out on the floor
dancing a hornpipe.
Nan snored on.
Seeing that Eriv’s"screams continued, and would
sooner or later bring their mother, Ted did not
Wait to repair his mistake, but scuttled off to his
own room and to bed. And Em, seeing it was no
use standing in the cold, crying, got back into bed
and settled down to sleep.
Nan ceased to snore and laughed to herself.
Presently she too went to sleep.
D. M. Ross (of Hamilton, Maoriland) whose
substantial book of verses, The Afterglow, is just
published,for subscribers at Auckland, is a writer
who needs only a stronger pulse and a finer taste
to be memorable. His work is often right in
grain: given a little exaltation of his fancy, a
little more delicacy in his phrases and harmonies,
and one could praise him and enjoy him. Much of
The Afterglou’ is curiously flat, a mere superficies
©f verbiage destitute of emotion. The author
seems to feel his themes, he handles them
not unskilfully, but he rarely conveys his
feeling to. the reader. He attempts sonnets
and blank verse, and succeeds in both forms : his
soiffi'ets, in fact, are the most satisfactory ex-
pression of him. In addition there are some two
hundred pages of verse in various metres, rarely
bad and never quite good : an even performance
on an ordinary plane.
Rass’s dedicatory verse is addressed to every-
body who will accept it—
Within a garden old
That yonder lies,
Guarded by gates of gold
Near Paradise,
I planted little seeds
Of hopes and fears,
That grew to flowers, and weeds
Bedewed with tears.
And some, too frail for light,
Hid in tfle shade;
While some crept f rom the night,
ris half afraid.
This only blossom rose
Bi ave o’er the sod,
And it I pluck for those
Beloved of God. .
It jars. Ross’s sense and knowledge of words
are fair only. He writes—
Within my breast the pulses beat
At dream-clasps, holding me full tight. . .
or—
In a palace that’s old and radiant
A single high stairway stands . . .
With a slur that even a tyro should avoid. Or he
rhymes poesy with rosy, and addresses his subject
as thou -and you in juxtaposed verses. For com-
pensation he will write—
I went to Love’s old treasure-house last night. .4
And saw the miser Memory, grown gray
With years of jealous counting of his gems. ..
“ And this,” he said, “ is gold from out her hair.
And this the moonlight that she wandered in,
With here a rose, enarrielled by her bveath,
That blQomed in glory ’tween her breasts, and here
The brimming sun-cup that she quaffed at noon,
And here the star that cheered her in the night...
or—
Far on the Mount of Olives, little vrinds
Whispered each other of the laggard morn :
The cedars shook themselves away from sleep. ..
And it is such lines as the last that give hope he
will write better.
At present this sonnet may fairly measure his
mettle—
TELLING DREAMS.
JVTEXT morning Ted and Em had forgotten
\ their wrongs, thanks to Nan, whose
-A-l efforts to amuse them had been un-
flagging since early morning.
“I dreamt last night,” Nan said at the break-
fast-table, “ that we were going to have stewed
fowl. I saw it stewing on the fire. And when
we took it up to eat it, it was a blacking-brush.”
Ted laughed loudly.
“ I dreamt that, too,” Em said.
“ You did ?” jeered Ted. “ What sort of a pot
was the fowl in ? ”
“A four-legged one.”
“ Got you ! Pots only have three legs.”
“ It must have been a boiler, then.”
“Boilers h<ave no legs.”
“Well, it must have been a gridiron, then—
they’ve got four legs.”
“ Here Ted shouted lustily, and -teased unmer-
cifully. “ Who ever heard of boiling Anything in
a gridiron ! ’’—and he laughed again, Nan help-
ing him this time.
Em began to cry.
“I’ll tell you what I dreamt. Nan,” and Ted
made haste to swallow what was in his mouth.
“I dreamt I saw two crows fighting, a little
one and a big one, and the little one was getting
the worst of it, so I ran out with a big stick to
part them, and they turned into a thousand blacks
with spears, and they rushed at me all at once,
and I stood in the middle and whirled the stick
round and round and kept them off, and every
time one’d make a dash at me I’d down-him, till
at last I downed the lot. Then I looked round
and there was only the two crows fighting, and
the little one was getting the best of it.”
Next morning the breakfast-table listened to
more dreams.
“I dreamt two such funny things last night,”
Jsan said. “I dreamt there was a bank with
creepers and things growing all over it, and there
were three birds there, two swallows, and I don’t
know what the other was, but it was bigger than
the swallows. And it had the two little swallows
hanging to a vine, and was pecking at their hearts,
and the poor little swallows were frightened and
shivering with pain. I thought I rushed at the
big cruel bird and caught it and crushed it in my
hand—and it felt soft. Then I thought I looked
at it, and it was pretty and quiet and little—and
it shivered, too.
“ The other dream was about fairies. I dreamt
I was in a wood—l thought I was lost, and I
came to a lovely dell where I could hear singing
and hells jingling, and all sorts of lovely music,
and I thought I went towards where the music
came from, and there was a gate—such a funny
one, it was made of twisted saplings and leaves —-
and all sorts of fruit grew on it—funny kinds
of fruit, not like any we get at all.
Some of it was white as snow, and some blue and
some yellow and red and greerf, and I could see
right, through them all. And, instead of stones,
like our fruit’s got, they had diamonds and rubies
and pearls in the middle. (Oh, it was lovely ! I
just stood there and looked and looked),
“Then the gate flew open and a big flash of
light came out and nearly blinded me (you ought
to have seen it!). Then thousands and thousands
of fairies came out on horseback—such pretty
fipsy fairies, all laughing and talking ! —and they
ad little packs of silk arid satin and lace and all
sorts of lovely things in front of them (I suppose
they were taking them away to sell), and the
horses had three rows of little tiny bells round
their necks, and they all tinkled different tunes.
I could n’t hear the horses’ tread—they seemed as
if ithey were shod with velvet. Then the
fairies began to sing, and oh ! their eyes
shond , like—like—like pieces of glass in the
sun, and their hair was like fires—it glistened so
lovely, arid-when they moved about or shook with
laughing, thousands and thousands of sparks flew
up and went out. I stood at the fruit gate till
they all passed out, then I slipped in and looked
at their dell, and there were only the old fairies
left. Such old men and old women—all bent, and
lame, and withered, and oh, so ugly. Then I
woke. That’sail.”
“Cripps, Nan, you do dream grand things.
Wish I could see those lovely things,” Ted said.
“ I dreamt the very same,” Em added.
“Gahn,” mocked Ted. “What sort of legs
did the fairies have?”
“ Withered ones.”
“llow did you see rhem ? ”
“When they were getting on their horses.”
“ Did n’t they have any stockings on ? ”
Em thought a bit, then said : “One of them’s
stockings was down.”
“Did any of them have their stockings down,
Nan?” Ted asked.
“ No, I did n’t notice any. They all looked nice
and neat.”
“I told you so,” Ted said, turning to Em, “ I
don’t believe you ever dreamt anything in your
life. All you ’re good for’s snoring.”
I don’t snore,” Em squealed, and began a dis-
mal howl.
Ted had dreamed nothing that night, but the
following morning he ran in to his breakfast
wildly excited.
“I’m going to tell mine first this morning, Nan,
—I can’t wait. I’ve dreamt something splendid—
grander than all yours put”together. It’s magnifi-
center ! ”
Nan straightened herself, smoothed out her
pinafore, and leaning her head on her hand, pre-
pared to listen.
Em looked lingeringly—approved Nan’s atti-
tude, and copied.
Ted could n’t sit down to tell his dream—he was
bursting with importance—so he stood up, folded
his arms and began.
“ I thought 1 was a long, long way out West,
where the trees had no leaves and the grass was
burnt up, and it looked as if a big wind had swept
the ground clean. And there was a long, long,
winding road, and away, right away down the
road, a long black thing—it looked like a tremen-
jous snake—was coming along. When it got
closer I saw it was a funeral and I took off my hat
while it passed, then afterwards I followed it and
asked one of the funeral who was dead, and he
said ‘ The king. ’ Then I asked him what king,
and he said ‘ King Drought.’ He said he was the
greatest fighter in the world and killed everything
he came near with his tremenjous sword. Then
he said ‘ But he’s dead now,’ and looked sorry-
like. And I said ‘ Aren’t you glad ?’ and he said
‘No,’ and I said ‘Why?’ and he said ‘Oh, wo
thought he was cruel once, but we don’t now,
because we’re ever s« much happier than we were
before.’ Then afterwards he said ‘You wait,
you’ll see.’ And he said they were all dead and
they knew. Then the funeral stopped and one of
them read out of a prayer book, and when he was
finished they all began to erv. Then I woke, and
the rain was coming down in torrents. Look at
it now, Nan, it’s pouring still ! ”
“I dreamt ” Em stopped.
"You did not! Don’t you dare to ..say you
dreamt that or I’ll knock you down. Yes, I’ll
knock you down. I dasli well won’t let you
dream what I dream. Nobody but me could
dream it—nobody ! nobody, I tell you ! ”
Em cowered towards Nan. Ted did not look
quite himself. But presently he grew calmer,
and the three looked out and watched the rain
beat down as it had not done for years.
C.M.A.
THE SILENT TIDE.
I heard Old Ocean raise her voice and cry
In that still hour between the night and day ;
1 saw the answering tides, green-robed and gray.
Turn to her with a low, contented sigh ;
Marching with silent feet they passed me by,
For the white moon had taught them to obey.
And scarce a wavelet broke in fretful spray
As they went forth to kiss the stooping slcy.
So, to my heart, when the last sunray sleeps,
And the wan night, impatient for the moon.
Throws her gray mantle over land and sea,
There comes a call from out Life’s nether deeps.
And tides, like some old ocean in a swoon.
Flow out, in soundless majesty, to thee.
——r—
“ Every city, like every mortal,” writes Herbert
Vivian, “has a physiognomy wherein those who
run may read an index of character. Berlin
always stands to attention with, her houses drawn
up as though on parade ; Vienna stands at ease,
but you feel that she has not laid aside her arms ;
.Paris wears a hollow, leering laugh and a frayed
skirt; Madrid conveys an air of hospitality, whose
parents are poverty and pride. . . . Bucharest may
be summed up as a city of pleasures and palaces,
a metropolis of perpetual carnival, a temple of
boisterous joviality. Pier engaging people com-
bine the colour, the grace and the hospitable
instincts of the East with the comfort and con-
venienhe of the West; every instant spent among
them yields a quintessence of life and joy and
warmth and colour. A small Paris indeed? Nay,
by Cock ! ’tis a little Paradise.”
“The Irish theatre is a house of dreams in a
street of gaunt realities. ”

Fred Bussell 'on Ventriloquism (Melb., Allen

DUCK.
Roll the tonyue towards the bapk part of the palate,
say “ Wuack ! vvuack ! not “quack”—down in the
throat, and send the sound through the nose.
Already many local politicians have benefited by
this advice : their speeches prove it nightly.
Gertrude Atherton grows less vigorous, and her
men and women do not meet nowadays with the
exuberant passion that roared through the Cali-
fornian redwoods. Still, she feels things, and
occasionally she says things in the mode aforetime!
Love, my dear, is one exquisite disappointment from
start to finish —for the woman, I mean... But I have
also wondered, ma chfere, if, did man give us what that
craving thing we call our soul demands, would we enjoy
ourselves even as much as we do. .. However, the fact
remains that man is eternally unsatisfactory and the
woman eternally unsatisfied.
And so on, without particular conviction. The
passage occurs in Rulers of Kings (Macmillan ;
2s. Oil.), which catches the very model of a moral
Yankee millionaire in the act of marrying a
daughter of the Emperor of Austria. Poor
Emperrir ! if he does not agree he is told that,
thanks to Yankee inventions, Austria will become
a province of Russia. -
One London Season, by Caroline Fisher (Black-
wood ; 2s. 6 d.), and The Kiw/s Fool, by Michael
Barrington (Blackwood; 2s. fid.),■ unite with The
Adventures of Elizabeth in Riigen (Macmillan ;

stimulus in them; and the old favorites can
better soothe.

HEBE IS A WAN!
WHO WANTS HIM?
“ He’s all here, what there is of him. He’s sound of limb, no bones
broken, and carries no superfluous flesh. He has as many ribs as
anyone—you can count them; and all he needs is a new supply of
Vitality, and that he can get from Dr. McLaughlin’s Electric Belt.”
Give us a man who is Broken in Health, who is Nervous, whose Brain and Body are Weak, whose
Strength and Vitality are Failing, who Sleeps Badly, Awakes More Tired than when he goes to Bed, who
is easily Discouraged, inclined to brood over imaginary troubles, who has Lost Energy and Ambition
to tackle hard problems, or who Lacks Animal Electricity, and in Less Than Three Months we will
Reorganise his entire Nervous System, Build Up where he is Broken Down, Invigorate his Circulation,
and pump his system full of New Life, New Energy, and New Vigor.
Dr. McLaughlin’s Electric Belt
will do it for every Weak Man who has lost his power and strength, men who have allowed themselves
to go into decline through excesses and bad habits, causing a waste of the amount of Electricity Nature
will positively Cure All Pains or Aches, Rheumatism, Sciatica, Weak Back, Sprains, and All Troubles of the Liver,
Marvellous results are obtained where Ailments have been of fifteen and twenty years’ standing.
READ THESE LETTERS:
FULLERTON, N.S.W.
Gentlemen,—l am proud and happy to inform you that the
High-Grade Belt y.m sent is making a new man of me, although
I am seventv-seven years of age. The pains in my back,
shoulders and hips are all gone, and I have no more use for
other so-called remedies. My digestive organs are improving
very fast, and lam full of life and energy. I am, indeed, thank-
ful for what the McLaughlin Electric Belt has done for me.
Truly yours, S. M. SMITH.
SHEPLEY, BLACKHEATH, N.B.W.
Dear Sirs,—l have now been using your Belt for sixty days,
and am exceedingly pleased with the marked improvement in
my strength and general health ; in fact, I am quite a different
man since using it. The results have exceeded my most sanguine
expectations. My friends are suprised at the great change and
improvement in my appearance, and I tell them it is all owing to
the use of your Belt. Yours respectfully
JOHN BASTIN.
HOPTOWN, JUNG JUNG, VIO.
Dear Sirs,—With reference to my health. I beg to state that
I am bitter than ever I was in my life. I consider the Dr.
McLaughlin Electric Belt one of the best inventions of the age.
I have been wearing your Belt for two months, and have received
the greatest benefits from its use, and I can safely recommend it
to anyone troubled with a weakness. lam now strong, notweak
lik&. i used to be before using the Belt. Wishing you every
success, I remain, yours faithfully, GEORGE F. MOTTRAM.

BAD COMPLEXIONS
Dry Thin and Falling Hair and Red
Rough Hands Prevented by
CUTICURA SOAP
MILLIONS use Cuticura Soap, assisted by Cuticura Ointment,
for preserving, purifying, and beautifying the skin, for cleans-
ing the scalp of crusts, scales, and dandruff, and the stopping
of falling hair, for softening, -whitening, and soothing red,
rough, and sore hands, for baby rashes, itchings, and chafings, in the
form of baths for annoying irritations and inflammations, or too free
or offensive perspiration, in the form of washes, for ulcerative weak-
nesses, and for many sanative, antiseptic, cleansing purposes which
readily suggest themselves to women, especially mothers, and for all
the purposes of the toilet, bath, and nursery. Cuticura Soap com-
bines delicate emollient properties derived from Cuticura Ointment,
the great skin cure, with the purest of cleansing ingredients and
the most refreshing of flower odours. No other medicated soap is to
be compared with it for preserving, purifying, and beautifying the
skin, scalp, hair, and hands. No other foreign or domestic toilet soap,
however expensive, is to be compared with it for all the purposes of
the toilet, bath, and nursery. Thus it combines in One Soap at One
Price, the best skin and complexion soap, and the best toilet and
baby soap in the world.
COMPLETE EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL TREATMENT FOREVERY HUMOUR,
Consisting of Cuticura Soap, to cleanse the skin of crusts and scales, and soften the
tjuckenecf cuticle; Cuticura Ointment, to instantly allay itching, inflammation, and
irritation, and soothe and heal; and Cuticura Resolvent Pills, to cool and cleanse the
blood. A Single Set is often sufficient to cure torturing, disfiguring humours, eczemas,
rashes, and irritations, with loss of hair, when all else fails. Soid throughout the world.

Beauty Treatments.
The newspapers of all the big centres of the
world have recently been filled with articles
on the various kinds of ‘ ‘ Beauty Treatments
that now seem to be so popular in the attempt
to patch up people’s complexions. All sorts
of appliances are in use and those that promote
them are loud in their claims as to the good
they do. But there is a very much simpler
way to carry on a “beauty treatment and
that is by making the health so perfect that
Nature will take care of the effect. This is
best obtained by a course of Scott s Emulsion,
which throws the impurities out of the blood,
cuts off the insidious approach of diseases of
the throat and lungs and puts people in sound
health. With sound health, we can obtain
all of the beauty that Nature intended us to
have. Scott’s Emulsion is cod liver oil with
hypophosphites of lime and soda and glycerine
in such proportions and of such purity as
guarantee you in always securing the effects
that are promised. If you need health, send
4d. (for postage) to Scott and Bowne, Ltd.,
483 Kent-street, Sydney, mention this paper,
and you will receive a sample bottle. All
chemists sell Scott’s Emulsion.

Next year they’ll rise and “ shoot the moon,” who

We sit to-day in Parliament who last year were in

We hear the heathen’s far lament—the local poor
may wail.
No matter what our fortune is, a million or a

We gamble with the same old foe—that grinning
thing called Time.
Our schedules vast to-day we file for half-pence in

New debts to-morrow will we pile—when credit

We moderns dread maternity, that once all women
loved ;
We monkey with Eternity with fingers neatly
gloved ;
We hire us fools to preach to us, behind whose
backs we laugh ;
We gag all those who’d teach to us no gospel half-

We pat our vices lovingly, and call them virtues
grand—
Should e’er man speak reprovingly, we yell “Go
on the land ! ”
We are a most amusing lot—we’re mostly daubed
with slime,
And down the stream we speed between the
muddy banks of Time.
On thrones and such we keep a lot of puppet gods

Then lo ! there comes a reaper-lot—and U ! their
reaping stings ! , ■
With flashing scythes they hew them down, the
kings and gods we made ;
Forgetting we once threw them down, we curse
the mowing blade !
A paltry thing’s our memory, a paltry thing’s our
mind— ' : ...
The grinding of life’s emery has shorn the precious
rind.!
What’s crowned to-day to-morrow .dieSj per scaffold

We gasp and then our sorrow dies—fresh play-
things are in stc ck !
We’re pleased and then we tire of them, wo
mourn them in a rhyme,
And set the verse to music ground out by the
wheels of Time.
We give and take in marriages (we strive to make
it “take”); ... . . ~
In costly cabs and carriages rides virtue with the
We prate about our holiness when both hands
reek of sin—
No vestige of a soul in us automatons a-grm.
We leer and lie right cheerfully when, on the
cushioned seats, .
We eye those hanging fearfully behind on straps
and cleats;
We drive in style perhaps to-day, to-morrow we
may be .

The Night Steamer.
The steamer late at night
Came gliding to the quay
With scarce a ripple white—
She moved so silently.
The people at her rail,
Who peered into the gloom,
They looked like phantoms pale
That hover near a tomb.
The people on the quay—
Whereon a dim light gleamed,
Fitful and faint—to me
A crowd of shadows seemed.
Then from an unseen tower
A clock, to men below,
Tolled forth the midnight hour
With solemn voice and slow.
Thus, when to me has passed
Life, love, and drink, and rhyme,
I’ll listen to the last
Mocking farewell of Time.
And, waiting by a dark,
Still water, I shall so
See Captain Charon’s barque
Glide in with fires banked low.

White Poppies.
Roses for love, with fairest broidery
Of immortelles, and frail forget-me-not;
Pansies for tender thoughts, and rosemary
For those who cannot bear to be forget.
But strew on me, when I am buried deep,
White poppies for sound sleep.
Roses for stricken love—but love is care,
And old remembrance is remembered woe
Anguish, and fret, and bitter words are there;
But here, within the dark, wouldst have it so.
Better to rest, and with the poppies drowse,
Where whirlwinds cannot rouse.
Lilies for lovers’ tears, but far more sweet .
The languid blossoms that can soothe all pam,
Pansies for thoughts —but let me rather greet
Dull poppied dreams that still the drowsy brain.
Let other blossoms be—l charge you spread
White poppies round my bed.

A DISMAL TIME.
Vitality Restored to
an Enfeebied System
The Case of ti[r. A. W. LYON.
(BY OUR SPUfIrAL REPORTER.)
Among the instances in which an attempt
has been made to deal with questions attain-
ing a wide popularity is that appearing here-
iurider, and the facts that have been adduced
iby Mr. Alfred William Lyon, of No. 56
Brougham-street, Glebe, will enable a fairly
intelligent man to come to a definite con-
elusion upon those phases of the subject
about which he may now be doubtful.
“ I can trace the origin of my adversities
to a mishap which I encountered whilst in
the act of taking a stone from the hoof of a
horse,” said Mr. Lyon to our reporter. “As
I stooped to raise his hoof I received a kick
on the head, and although I was almost
stunned I managed to pick myself up, and
•was making my escape when the horse
kicked me again, but that time on my
ribs.”
“ It is a wonder you were not killed,”
interrupted the writer.
“It is, indeed ; but I was not out of
danger for a long time, as I was laid up for
fourteen weeks and became quite a wreck.
When at last my injuries were repaired I
went back to work, although I was almost
too weak to do so, and on the 20th March,
1899, I again met with another accident. I
was removing scenery and effects to a
theatre, and whilst taking a heavy box to
the cellar I severely strained myself. Mind
you, 1 felt pains about the kidneys from the
time I was first injured, but I did not think
they were in any way diseased. I thought
the pains were the direct result of the heavy
blow I had received, but the acute torture
which now caught me across the back made
me realise only too bitterly that my kidneys
were greatly disordered. When I stooped
I could not get up again, and had to sit
there. Such terrible agony I had never ex-
perienced before. There was a sharp pain
in my side as if the flesh was being drawn
from me, and I could not remain in an up-
right position for the excruciating tortures
that were bearing me down.”
“ I suppose you were compelled to leave
your work again ?”
“ Indeed I was, and was so helpless that
for three weeks I could not leave my bed. 1
really thought it was all over with me, my
parents also being deeply concerned at the
terrible condition I was in. You see, I fell
away in flesh so rapidly that at the end of
the third week after my accident I was two
stone lighter. There is no doubt that I was
just like a shadow, and so miserable at
being ill and unable to do my work that I
did not have a moment’s cheerfulness of
mind either day or night. I never had the
least desire for food, the smell of which
turned me sick, and if by any chance 1 did
succeed in getting anything down, every bit
of it came back again, for I hardly
remember a meal which was not soon
followed by a violent fit of vomiting. That
was the main reason why I become so fright-
fully thin, but another cause of the hopeless
feeling which weighed on my spirits was
that I could not get a quarter of the amount
of sleep I required. Through lying down
all day my body was so racked with aches
that I could never feel comfortable, but
occasionally I became so overcome with
fatigue that I dozed off in spite of all my
tortures, and evqn then I was not much
better off, as I always had horrible dreams
that woke me up with a trembling start.
What a dismal life it was to be sure ! My
head ached to such a maddening extent that
I could not bear the weight of my hair, so I
had it shaved off". If I stood up I felt top-
heavy and dizzy, and had to hold on to
something to steady myself, while the
swollen feeling about my eyes was so dis-
tracting that sometimes I could hardly see.
This dreadful state of affairs went on for
seventeen or eighteen moil hs, increased
suffering being my portion from day to
day ; and I can tell you I was thoroughly
sick and tired of it all. My stomach
bulged out with wind, which 'ilso
gave me a lot of pain, and many
an anxious fear I have had through my heart
palpitating to excess. I ceased to care how
things would end, fori was almost too weak
to hope for a recovery, and everything
I possible seemed to go against me. Why,
even my taste wa3 destroyed by a sense of
I bitterness which would not go away, and
my tongue was so rough that it was more
like a brush than anything else. The
1 medicines I took to remove my painful
symptoms were not the least good to me,
and when there was not a thread of hope to
cling to I realised what an awful thing it is
to suffer in despair. I gave up asking
advice, but the best I had yet received came
when it was most urgently required.”
“ What advice was that? ”
“ It was to take Clements Tonic, and as I
was willing to take anything at all, I bought
some—not that I thought it would cure
me ; but when I had drank one bottle I was
certainly no worse, so I purchased a couple
more. Then I seemed to liven up a bit, as
though Clements Tonic had put some
vitality into my enfeebled system, and in
another week I found that this idea was
right, sure enough. The suffering I had
endured all these months was undoubtedly
minimised, the pains in my back being won-
derfully relieved, and, to my utter astonish-
ment, my appetite came back. Very little
more time elapsed before the vomiting
troubles had entirely ceased, and from then
I moved along quickly to the recovery of
my health, which uothing but Clements
Tonic could bring about. I felt as jubilant
as any man could be, and who would not
feel so at such a surprising liberation from
physical captivity? A new and happy
existence came to me by using Clements
Tonic, which rectified dizziness, headaches,
and stomach pains so surely that they have
never troubled me since, and by soothing
and quietening my nerves I gained so much
comfort from the use of that medicine that
I was soon able to sleep as soundly as I
could when a boy at school. My mouth
was freed from its nasty taste, my tongue
was cleansed, and in all respects I gained
by using Clements Tonic, even to being
released from the pains in my side and
chest and having my heart affections
abolished. I was soon able to go back to
work, but my employer did not know me, I
had altered so ; but by sticking to Clements
Tonic the lines of suffering were obliterated
from my face, and my body again filled out
with flesh.”
“ Did Clements Tonic cure you thorough-
ly ? ”
“ I can conscientiously say it did, and as
I am sure Clements Tonic is the most
reliable medicine in the country, I always
recommend it to my friends, and you may
publish our conversation in any way you
want.”

FREE CURE.
Wonderful Home Treatment that Cures
Without Pain or Loss of Time.
Dr. W. 8. Rice (Dept. 1317), 8 & 9, Stonecutter
Street, London, E.C., has invented a method that
cures rupture without pain, danger, operation, or
an hour’s loss of time from the day's work. To
bcv
avoid all questions of doubt, he
sends free to every sufferer a
free trial of his method, and
there can be no earthly reason
why anyone, rich or poor, should
not avail themselves of this
generous offer. As an instance
of this remarkable method,
the cure of Mr. J. J. Hogan,
Cobar, N.S.W., is well worth
noticing. He was cured at the
age of 70 years, after suffering
10 years. He made an affidavit

Mr. J. Embank, a farmer of Yarloop, Western
Australia, was cured after suffering 48 years from
a scrotal rupture. Mrs. F. Medley, 177, Sturt
Street, Ballarat, Victoria, Australia, was cured
after suffering 5 years. Mr. A. Docherty, 23, War-
wick Street, Birkenhead, Cheshire, England, was
cured of an irreducible scrotal rupture—one of the
worst kinds known. No treatment he had used
would enable him to return the rupture to its
proper place. He tried the method of Dr. Rice,
which not only reduced the rupture, but also
effected its complete cure, and he is now as sound
as a bell.«A full description and sample 'of this
remarkable method of cure will be gladly sent
upon application. It has cured thousands «Do not

THE CHANCE FOE A MAN WITH
AN IDEA.
In the State politics of New South Wales just now
everything is old, frayed, stale, unprofitable, and
sham. It seems that the Parliament which fizzled
out last January for want of a quorum, or common
sense, or a knowledge of when to come in out of
the wet —the Parliament which didn’t know it
was dead, and went on talking after its decease,
and had to be interrupted by the news that it was
defunct —won’t meet again. If it had met and
done something vigorous—abolished the Upper
House, passed a graduated land-tax, established a
Greater Sydney, declared against borrowing—if it
had met and done almost anything definite, it
might have gone to a country that took some
interest in it. As it is, it is a limp, brown, useless
thing going in three sections to an uninterested com-
munity. Premier See is angry and superfluous,
and has no policy and no management. Oppo-
sition-leader Carruthers is voluble, oleaginous,
and polysyllabic, and has nO vestige of a policy. He
talks at vast length about “reform,” and won’t
say what he is going to reform ; he clatters like
an illimitable Browning poem about “ economy,”
but apparently wild horses won’t drag from him a
jiint as to whether “economy” means borrowing a
million a year or five millions—whether it means
peaking ends meet or having not more than a half-
million shortage. And the Labor party, under
ihe slow, mild, respectable, timid M‘Gowen, has
done so little for the last two years that it might
almost as well be a prayer-meeting or a stamp-
collecting society. It is difficult to remember any
previous occasion when three parties went to the
Country without an idea among them, but on pre-
sent appearances that is about what will happen
in N.S.W. this year.
* * * »
If a man with an idea appeared now he might
sweep the country. He need not be a very big
man —only intelligent, honest, courageous, perse-
vering, and possessed of an idea. Just now, an
idea would loom up on the political horizon like a
piast in a.boundless ocean. The country is tired
pf the old mouldy generalities—the “settlement
of the people on the land,” the “ development of
our great natural resources,” the “ restoration of
constitutional government,” the “encouragement
p|industry,phe. “judicious expenditure of loan
moneys in order R> provide, the people with access
to the natural opportunities of the country,” the
“restoration of credit,” the tweedledum and
tweedledee, and the boojum and the snark, and
all the rest pf _ the mouthings that mean nothing,
and are not intended to mean anything. It is
weary of being governed by aldermen, and church-
wardens, and insects, and trifles. If one politician
pjf size would go to the country with a
big idea—one that hadn’t been mumbled among
the dry bones till the people were tired of
its very name—with an idea so definite that
there could be no mistaking what was meant, and
so emphatic that it would stand out among the
withered platitudes like a good deed in Sheol—an
idea that would make one-half the press revere
the author of it and the other half urge that he be
deposited in a luriatic asylum if somebody would
arise with an idea that would fill the land with
fight, he would be the most blessed individual in
N.S.W. politics to-day.
Almost the only possible war-cry is the aboli-
tion of borrowing. It is new—-none of the small,
pottering men have ever dared to touch it, and no
election has ever been fought on it before.
It is absolutely definite—not a hazy catch-
word like the “development of the great
natural resources” or the “upholding of
the Protestant faith” or the other old brown
moans that have become so familiar that even the
wind utters them every time it blows through an
empty bottle left by the roadside, If a politician
of any size raged through the country as the
leader and organiser of a party which undertook
to utterly abolish borrowing except : for the re-
newal of old loans as thby fell due, to provide a
small sinking fund on those' renewed loans, and to
find £1,500,000 a year out of revenue for public
works purposes, he would be the first man to get
out of the ruck. He would be the best-advertised
man in Australia, and there would be half-a-
columii of English opinions about him in the in-
dignant morning papers. One half the press would
call him a demi-god, and the other half would
describe Rim as a lunatic. He would be the be-
ginning of a new era. And the work which he pro-
posed to do would, after all, be perfectly possible.
It is merely necessary for N.S.W. to pay its way, as
almost every other country in the world does in
peace time, out of its taxation revenue and the
revenue from public services; and the land receipts
would provide the public works fund and the
sinking fund. The problem is so simple that no
politician ever had a chance to be a great man or
an utterly unusual man on such easy terms
before.
*,*. . * *
As things are just' now it isn’t worth while being
a big man in N.S.W. politics. The small men do
just as well. The fiscal issue has gone out of the
reach of the State Parliament. The Federation
campaign is over and done with. The Unification
campaign hasn’t commenced. Arbitration and
old age pensions are both questions that have
been attended to. Local Government is still to
be completed, but that question has been mauled
for so many years by so many political hacks
that the party which went to the country on it
would only be laughed at. No one will believe in
Local Government till it arrives. A proposal to
abolish the Upper House would hardly make a
ripple just now. The Upper House is doing no
harm at present except being foolish, useless and
not ornamental, and a needless expense. It isn’t
getting in the way of any great public measures
because there are none. Politics have got down
to be a struggle after small loans, a receiving of
deputations, a pottering about culverts, and a
quarrel about some little Jew wrongly convicted
of receiving stolen goods, and about some policeman
having been “removed”; and while they remain
at that level John Kidd is just about as good as
Solomon, and Waddell answers as well as Moses
or Bismarck or Aristides. Solomon couldn’t
look any wiser while inspecting a culvert than
J ohn Kidd ; it would merely be a grievous waste
of good Solomon. The only way whereby a
big man can assert himself is by lifting-
politics above the culvert and Kidd level—by
throwing into the political arena a question that
is beyond the small men’s capacity ; and if there
is a big man available, or one who thinks himself
a big man, the chance is here. That man will
never look any bigger than anybody else while
politics consist mainly of culverts. Napoleon
chasing a mouse doesn’t look any greater a general
than Pa Brunker ; therefore Napoleon, being a
big man, took to chasing emperors instead —which
is a case in point. And the man who went to the
country on this principle Would at least have some-
thing to talk about—something more than the
“development of tire great natural resources” and
the alleged injustice done to a policeman who
wasn’t paid overtime on polling-day. He could
lay before the country a tale of profligacy, bank-
ruptcy, folly, incapacity, and dry-rot that would
out-shrielc every yellow novel yet published. If
he told his story well, N.S.W. would have burnt
its boats. No more foreign loans would 'be
possible.
* * * *
The position of leader in this matter is open to
men of all parties. The Carruthers crowd was
in office three years under ParkEs and had three
shameful deficits; also, it was in office five years
under Reid and put up almost the record deficit-
over £600,000 in one year. The present Govern-
ment has been in office for four years under Lyne
and See and has had four deficits—though all of
them put together don’t equal Reid’s awful record
for a single year. The Carruihers crowd, with
no resumptions to_pay for, ran up the loan ex-
penditure in 1891 to £4 3s. 2d. per inhabitant;
the See-owe’Sullivan crowd went as high, in
1902, as £3 11s. 7d. per inhabitant, though a
large portion of that went to pay for land
resumptions which were forced on their pre-
decessor, Lyne, by a panic-stricken Parliament in
the plague scare time— Carruthers and his friends
assisting. The Labor party has connived at all
these profligacies and said nothing. Under these
circumstances the man who moves in the matter
can simply say that he is the individual who came
to his senses first. His opponents will enjoy the
blessed consistency of remaining in a state of
lunacy ; he will be the inconsistent person who re-
covers. And if he is a man who likes fight—who
doesn’t want to doze away his whole life on the lee
of a hedge, or to potter it away among people like
Perry and Kidd and John Stinson— he has a
chance to have a really good time.
COTTON AND COOLIES.
Sixty years ago there was a noisy and influential
gang of mean and ignorant whites in England who
were sure that the country’s industries would
perish if they were not watered with the blood
and sweat of women and children. When at
length all but silk factories were closed to children
under nine, and when in other factories children
of from nine to 13 were only allowed to be worked
for 48 hours a week, these same mean whites,
dreading the economical results of the loss of
children’s labor, induced the Government to pro-
pose that children over 11 should be allowed to
work the full time of 69 hours per week. For
years after that the same gang blocked every
change in the working of mines, alleging that the
mineral could not possibly be broken at a profit
if women and children were barred from going
underground. Since then every one of these
predictions, and a thousand others of the same
sort, have been stamped as lies. Yet exactly the
same mean gang tells exactly the same kind of
mean lie to-day. Barred from employing women
and infants, they seek precisely the same results
by demanding the right to employ cheap colored
labor; and they back up their demands with the
same arguments. Almost every page of last
century’s history laughs at their fears, tears their
argument to tatters, and convicts them in many
cases of an inhuman selfishness; and yet their
blind leaders in the Sydney daily papers, and in a
good many papers outside Sydney, hold up these
men as the only true patriots and the pure merinoes
of the Christian flock.
» * * *
In Australia the battle was fought in connection
with Victorian mining between 20 and 30 years
ago. The richest of the surface gold gone, the
poor, mean white who had no inventive faculty
himself, and whose one miserable and aboriginal
scheme of cheapening production was the employ-
hient of cheap labor, declared that if he could
not have the cheap Chinaman the industry was
doomed. Fortunately the Victorian goldfields
had some of the spirit of Eureka Stockade left;
the attempt to sandwich one white miner between
two Chinese assistants was resisted with so much
vigor that it was dropped. Then what the mean
white with his little brain could not do without
the cheap, yellow foreigner, the engineer and the
chemist did, and did far better ; so that, after
50 years’ continuous working, the Victorian mines
are producing to-day as much as they did 25 years
ago, and in the first quarter of this year paid
£148,915 in dividends on an output of 182,2250 z.
To-day, therefore, the. old demand for the cheap
Chinaman is only a memory.
* * * *
But the mean white, who has so poor an opinion
of his race that he can only see salvation through
a race which he professes to despise, is-as per-
sistent in other directions as ever. No suggestion
for the establishment of a new industry is ever
made, but he flies to this one refuge of cheap labor.
He was convinced of nothing so firmly as that the
sugar industry was doomed if the Kanaka were
not forthcoming; yet Kanaka immigration has
been stopped, and never as much sugar was grown
before as was cut last season. In all the years of
the Kanaka’s reign not one single improvement of
the slightest importance was made in connection
with the work which these cheap men were put to
do. Aborigines on the very lowest rungs of the
ladder of civilisation, they had no idea of evolving
any of thpse mechanical aids which almost
alone have made nations rich and prosperous.
Compare the progress made in connection with
that industry with that which has marked Vic-
torian mining, where an opposite policy has
been pursued ; and the cheap aboriginal human
machine, incapable of improvement, stands con-
demned.
• * * •
Yet this utterly discredited policy—a policy
with hundreds of failures against it, and not one
success —is now being advocated in connection
with cotton-growing, which it is suggested Aus-
tralia might take up. The cotton plant will grow
luxuriantly in parts of. this continent; that is
proved. It does not even have to be acclimatised.
Mr. Holtze, curator of the Palmerston (N.T.)
Gardens, declares it to be “ indigenous to the
Wildman River district of the Northern
Territory, and exists as an escape from culti-
vation in other parts.” In Queensland, fibre
of the finest quality has been produced, and
at one time nearly 15,000 acres were under
cultivation, as much as 2,500,0001b5. being ex-
ported in one year. Prices, however, fell; the
State did not interest itself in the business; other
industries boomed and distracted attention from
this one; and it was permitted to die out. But
that an industry languished 20 years ago is no
reason why it should not thrive to-day. That
“ interference with private enterprise,” which so
shocks the stupid Tory person, has done wonders.
A good deal less than 20 years ago the Austral-
asian butter trade amounted to less than
2,000,0001b5. a year ; it was resurrected by State
interference in Victoria, Maoriland, and else-
where, and now it has reached 45,000,0001b5. The
S. Australian wine business, directed by State
experts and the State Export DepOt, has had a
similar history. And neither in butter-making
nor wine-making has either Kanaka or Chinaman
had a hand. After all, it does seem possible for
the white man to live without them.
* * * *
There is nothing about cotton-growing, either,
which specially calls for the cheap laborer. So far
from being a poor crop, it is one of the very rich-
est. It bears much the same relation to wheat
that the Great Boulder mine bears to a tailings
dump. In S. Australia the average value of the
wheat yield for 10 years past has been 14s. lid.
per acre; and white men live on that, and some of
them pay exorbitant rents. What a cotton crop
would return cannot be said absolutely, but
wherever it is grown it leaves all grain crops out of
sight as a source of profit. Some of the estimates
recently issued run to remarkable figures. Fifty
pounds per acre is spoken of as a minimiim, and
English cotton experts estimate that an acre will
grow 900 plants, and that in fibre and seed, each
plant is good for about half-a-crown, which
would work out at £ll2 10s. per acre.
The white man can make a living out of a crop
which yields 14s. lid. per acre; and not even
Jenkins Iscariot suggests that wheat-growing is
doomed if it doesn’t get the coolie. But such a
wretched opinion has the mean white of his own
race that he is appalled at the idea of making a
living out of a crop which yields up to £5O. He
confesses himself a poor, miserable person who
can’t make even that pay without calling in a
coolie of some sort to help him. And then he
talks about the “sturdy independence of the
Anglo-Saxon race.”
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Anti-Borrowing Party in N.S.W.
The Bulletin has issued a circular to members of
the Assembly and candidates for a place therein,
with a view to finding the material for an anti-
borrowing party—a manly national party which is
prepared to maintain that an Australian isn’t
necessarily the poorest specimen on earth, and
that he can live on his own resources just as well
as a Dutchman or a Dago. The circular asked
these three short and simple questions :
Are you (1) In favor of an absolute cessation of borrow-
ing, except for renewal purposes— i.e., are you against
any increase of the public debt ?
(2) In favor of establishing a sinking fund for the repay-
ment of existing debts ?
(3) In favor of setting aside an adequate sum out of
revenue for the maintenance of public works and the con-
struction of necessary new works ?
These questions put a straight issue, away from
all the indefinite vaporings about “economy”
which mean nothing, and all the musty generalities
about “ the restoration of our credit ” which mean
less than nothing. They practically amount to
the proposal that N.S.W. should pay the ordinary
expenses of government out of taxation and
receipts from services, as almost every other
country does, and apply its land revenue—a rich
endowment such as is enjoyed by no other com-
munity of the same size in all this earth —to pay-
ing for public works and providing a sinking fund
for the reduction of the existing debt. At time of
writing, The Bulletin had already received
cordial assurances from the following fourteen
M.s.L.A. and two candidates, that they approved
of every item of the non-borrowing gospel:—
E. C. Y. Broughton, M.L.A.
J. R. Dacey, M.L.A.
Eden George, M.L.A.
John Hurley, M.L.A.
J. B. Nicholson, M.L.A
Philip H. Sullivan, M.L.A.
W. N. Willis, M.L.A.
E. M. Clarke, M.L.A.
J. O. L. Fitzpatrick, M.L. A
John Gillies, M.L. A.
Andrew Kelly, M.L. A.
C. W. Oakes, M.L.A.
Dr. Boss, M.L.A.
Edward Terry, M.L.A.
John D. Fitzgerald.
Wilfred Blackett.
These names represent the first batch of replies,
and they are even now quite numerous enough to
show that any real leader who comes forward on
the non-borrowing ticket will not lack for a party.
Before election day arrives there may be enough
names to show that it will be the other kind of
leader who will want for a party. So far the
unfavorable replies from members of the Assembly
number only five, as follows
W. P. Latimer, M.L.A., holds that to wholly cease bor-
rowing would “check the further development of this
young country.” Prom which The Bulletin gathers that
because a country is young and has, by reason of its
youth, a revenue of £2,000,000 a year from its unsold
public estate, therefore the only way to develop it is to
spend the land revenue, go in debt for all our public
works, and leave the repayment of the debt to a time
when there may be no land revenue left.
O. G. Wade, M.L.A., is in favor of a sinking fund, but is
of opinion that “we must look to loan money for purposes
of development of the State.” He also believes the way to
wealth lies in spending the land revenue, and doing the
development with the aid of a mortgage, and looking
forward to a cheerful time when we will have-little or no
land revenue left, and all our accumulated development to
pay for out of revenue (for loans must be repaid some
day), and, our credit being stopped (for credit stops some
day), all our future development to pay for out of
revenue also.
John Garland, M.L.A., is in favor of all three non-
borrowing propositions, with the curious proviso that
“ there are certain railways the construction of which
would do so much for the development of the country
that I would advocate borrowing money to construct
them, provided that money can be obtained at a
reasonable rate ” —the loan to have a si nlti ng fund attached.
P. E. Winchcombe, M.L.A., believes in borrowing for
reproductive works, with a sinking fund attached to each
new loan, sufficient to extinguish it in 30 years.
E. D. Meagher, M.L. A., is unfavorable in a general way.
Another member, G. A. Jones, M.L. A., is favor-
able to all three propositions with certain reserva-
tions, so the anti-loan party may be said to
already number 15 M’s.L.A. The Bulletin is
now waiting anxiously to hear from the Owe’-
Sullivan ; also from J. H. Carruthers and a few
other prominent economists. Up to now every
person heard from, save one, has either wholly dis-
approved of borrowing or has proposed borrowing
with a sinking fund attached to each loan, and in
no other way. So far as the inquiry has gone,
therefore, it has resulted in a unanimous con-
demnation of the present methods. And the con-
demnation will probably be a great deal louder
before election day.
The Shadow of a Dissolution.
George Reid is to “ take definite action ” daring
this week with regard to the Watson Govern-
ment. So his press supporters say. That means
that he will summon up enough courage to try to
assassinate the Government on the threshold of its
work. He probably believes that he will succeed..
The Bulletin is inclined to think otherwise. But
should Reid carry a vote of censure by one
or two votes—and his most sanguine sup-
porters do not hint at anything better than
that —a dissolution must follow, and the Demo-
cratic party is taking time by the forelock and
organising now for that event. In the case of cn
appeal to the country every seat held by a supporter
of the Reid motion will be challenged, either by a
direct Labor candidate or a Radical in sympathy
with the Watson Ministry. Those members who
vote with the Government will receive the Labor
support whether they are of the direct Labor
party or not. The rapid action taken to meet a
possible situation, and the ready inclination shawm
in all the States by the Labor organisations to
adopt the methods most likely of success in
support of the Watson administration, shows how
thoroughly the present Cabinet holds the sym-
pathy of the democracy. A general election on
the issue of a malicious and purposeless defeat of
the Government can, in the nature of things, have
but one result. Those who follow Reid to the
country on such a question may only hope to
return if they represent distinctly Tory con-
stituencies.
The Dodges of Joseph.
A few days ago Joseph Carruthers, leader of
the N.S.W. Deform party, fell in. Joseph is
afflicted with a grievous lack of large principles,
therefore one-half his speeches consist of foggy
generalities about politics and the other half of
petty P.D.A. tittle-tattle, mostly without names,
dates or particulars, about how the Government, at
the instance of the Pope of Rome, or the Patriarch
of Constantinople or the Chief Buddhist, or the
Boss Mohammedan, vilely threw a stone at a
Protestant’s goat, and thereby demonstrated its
utter unfitness for office. The nearest approach
to particulars came about when Joseph declared
that a certain magistrate and policeman had been
“removed” for doing their duty, and this one
approach to definiteness was where Joseph fell in.
The following interesting correspondence ensued :
Attorney-General Wise Asking Joseph for Par-
ticulars (21/5/’O4).
Sir,—ln yesterday’s issue of the Sydney Morning
Herald you are reported to have stated, at a meeting
at Wellington the preceding evening, that—" This was
the second attempt on the part of the Government to
tamper with the administration of justice, and they only
needed to go to a neighboring town to find a case in
which a police magistrate and a policeman, who were
just enough and brave enough to do their duty, were
removed from the town —not removed for neglect of duty,
but because they were determined to do their duty.”
These words contain, as far as relates to the police
magistrate, a very grave charge against this Department
and the Public Service Board, and I therefore have to ask
that you will furnish me with the name of the magis-
trate to whom (if correctly reported) you made reference.
In view of the seriousness of this matter, I shall be glad
if you will reply by return post.
Attorney-General Wise Prodding Joseph into Activity
(27/5/-04).
Sir, —I would invite your attention to my letter of the
21st instant asking you to furnish me with the name of
the magistrate to whom it is reported you made reference
when addressing a meeting at Wellington on the 19th
instant, to which I have not yet received a reply.
Joseph to Wise (28/5/’o4)—Faint Cry Like Kitten m
the Distance.
Dear Sir,—Your letter re the Police Magistrate to whom
I at Wellington only reached me last Wednesday,
on account of my absence from town until that day, and
since then I have been too much engaged in work of
importance to give it my attention. I am gathering,
however, particulars, which I will either forward to you
or deal with in my place in Parliament. I shall be glad
to know if you will permit me to peruse the Depart-
mental papers relating to the matter, in order to readily
refer to papers which otherwise it may take me some time
to collect, as they have, since I perused them, been sent
away by me to others in the country, and it will take
some time to get them back.
Wise Again Asking Joseph for Particulars (30/5/’O4).
Dear Sir,—l am in receipt of your letter of the 28th
instant, wherein you ask permission to peruse the Depart-
mental papers relating to the matter of the removal of
the police magistrate to whom you referred at Welling-
ton. As you have not complied with my-request to be
furnished with the name of the police magistrate to whom
you referred, I do not know what papers you are desirous
of perusing. As, however, I am desirous of assisting you
in every way, I will give instructions that you be allowed


to see the papers in the case, when you have furnished
me with the name of the gentleman.
Wise Calling Loudly in Joseph’s Ear (2/6/04).
Dear Sir,— Mav I again remind you that I have not yet
received a reply to my communications to you, dated, re-
spectively, the 21st, 27th, and 30th ultimo, asking you to
furnish the name of the Police Magistrate to whom you
referred when addressing a meeting at:Wellington on the
19th May. As the statement made by you ltflccts so
seriously on this department and the Public Service
Board, I must express my surprise that you have not
furnished me with the information asked for
Sudden Yap from Joseph (3/6/04).
Deir Sir—l recognise no right that you possess
to adopt the tone in your correspondence re the
police magistrate referred to in my address at
Wellington. The proper place to discuss matters
of this kind is in the Parliament which your
Ministry has kept closed to the people and their repre-
sentatives, and where one can command practically with
the concurrence of the House the production of necessary
papers. Your letter reached me eight days ago, being
addressed to the city whilst I was travelling in the
country. On receiving your letter I at once wrote to the
district for the full particulars, which have not yet reached
me although I wired again for them. I have made no
reflection on the Public Service Board, and beg you to
keep their name out of our controversy as I am just as
strong a believer in the integrity of that Board as anyone
in the community.
Wise Withdraws His Ambassador from Joseph’s
Court (4/6/’O4).
Dear Sir,—ln reply to your letter of the 3rd June,
permit me to remind you that you made a definite
and grave charge at a public meeting that a
police magistrate and policeman, “ who were just
enough and brave enough to do their duty, were
removed, not for neglect of duty, but because
they were determined to do their duty.” You cannot
deny that, in using these words, you knew that you were
imputing, and that you- intended to impute, to the
Government of which I am a member the grave offence,
to use your own words, of “ tampering with the adminis-
tration of justice.” I at once called upon you to name
the police magistrate, and although I have written four
letters to you on the subject, I |am up to the present-
unable to extract from you the name of the police magis-
trate referred to or the district in which he resided. You
now evade the request to substantiate this foul slander by
declaring that you will wait to do so until Parliament
meets. You did not wait to utter the slander until you
had reached a place where it could have been denied as
promptly as it was made, and where you would
either have been compelled to substantiate your
words, or make a humiliating withdrawal; but you
uttered the infamous assertion at a public meeting know-
ing full well that none of your audience would be
able to contradict you, and trusting that the falsehood
would gain credence owing to the public position which
you occupy. You now say that your charge does not
reflect on the Public Service Board. No one should know
better than yourself that the removal of a police magis-
trate from one district to another, even in the ordinary
course of Departmental changes, cannot be effected
without the sanction of the Public Service Board, and
that it would have been impossible to remove such an
officer by way of punishment without all the circumstances
being put before the Public Service Board and being
inquired into by them. Further, the police magistrate
could not have been appointed to another district without
the Board’s recommendation, so that your calumny rests
on them as directly as it does upon the Department of
which I have the honor to be the Ministerial head. In
fact, the Public Service Board have already drawn the
attention of the Under-Secretary of this Department to
the matter- Further, your words involve a charge of
gross dereliction on the part of the Inspector-General of
Police, because you also allege that a policeman was simi-
larly punished for doing his duty. Surely, under the cir-
cumstances, you will have the manliness either to with-
draw your charge, or by mentioning the person to whom
you refer, give me an opportunity of proving its falseness.
That was as far as the painful showing up of
Joseph had got when The Bulletin went to press,
but Joseph had by then started a brand-new lie
by stating that the Australian Senate wished to
seize a big area of N.S.W. land to form a “ Com-
munistic settlement.”
The Groper Election.
“J.E.W.” writes: Westralian general elections
transpire on June 28, or thereabouts. Happenings
which may be forecasted with certainty are that
the Labor party will gain a good many seats and
that the present ‘ ‘ direct Opposition ” —composed
of Pigott, the black-labor pearler, and a few
dreadful Groper Tories —will get lost. Beyond—
auguries are generally foggy and confused. The
country is thick with leagues and parties, and
such-like furniture, and candidates are falling over
one another. There is the National Political
League, an anaemic and scoffed-at relative of Kya-
bram, which is running candidates for Perth and
the suburbs. It has no truck with Premier
Jimmy’s crowd, and is opposing Labor candidates.
The publicans have also got a party—a lone, be-
wildered faction which is opposed to Jimmy be-
cause of his State pub., and to the Laborists
because State control is in their platform, and
which looks with a cold eye on the National
League because an ex-parson is its chief
panjandrum. Kalgoorlie lobs along under a
timid, tinpot Citizens’ Reform League, which will
be more than satisfied if it captures one seat.
There is a Cocky party also, with a Groper-Tory
policy, and a habit of running six candidates for
one seat. Then comes the Jimmy party, which
labels itself the Liberal party, and reckons to get
returned on what it has done. Next the Pigott
party, at present lost somewhere up Broome way.
Finally the Labor party. And in the general
crush of parties, and leagues and candidates, the
only crowd that seems to know what it is doing,
and where it is going to, is the Labor party. The
Laborists are contesting 39 of the 50 seats, and are
confident of winning 20. Some of them reckon on
an absolute majority. Their chief drawback is that
they go to the country without a leader. Hastie,
their nominal leader, achieved a reputation in
the last Parliament of being a political
plaything of the Government, and only cap-
tured his selection ballot by a few votes.
With a proved leader, a level-headed, practical
man like Chris. Watson, the Labor men could
win the election easily, despite all the opposing
forces of Groperism, J imesism, Bungism, and an
unfair redistribution. As it is they have a decent
chance. All the Ministers except Kingsmill
(returned unopposed for the House of llackett)
are being opposed, and two of them— Nanson and
Gregory —will probably get beaten. The Premier’s
own seat at East Perth—Laborist Casson is
running against him—is none too safe.
The Cant Phrase, “ Minority Rule.”
Last week the Watson Government got to the
point where it had to be decided whether it could
command a majority or not, and on the
of the inclusion of railway servants
Arbitration Bill—the question which
Government into existence —it mustered 36 votes
against the 24 which were all that Deakin and
Reid could gather between them. And yet, so
virulent a thing is habit and prejudice, that about
one-third of the newspapers of this country still
talks of the Watson Ministry as a shocking
example of the evils of minority rule. The party
idea is a curious survival and leads to curious
logic. There never was, and never is, and
never can be minority rule in Australia
so long as measures have to be carried by a
majority; a million fools and several dozen
fool papers may still babble about “ minority rule”
but while the alleged minority is 36 and tha
alleged majority is 24, they are only arguing
against accomplished facts. But there are two
ways of having a majority. One is to be seen in
all its beauty when the majority is pledged in
advance —when it undertakes to follow a certain
leader whether he does right or wrong; to approve
of what he does whether it is bad or good ; to sup-
port him even when he is obviously ruining the
country, as the Gillies-Deakin party did in Vic-
toria when the Gillies-Deakin Ministry was
building up the fearsome boom and preparing the
fearsome burst; to lie for him ; to sell the public
interests for him; and only to leave him when
further adherence means the loss of its seat.
That is what is called “majority rule,” in
the cant phrase of the daily paper, and
it is to restore that process of government
by the vote of a blind, mechanical, servile,
wooden, dead majority that the Deakin and Reid
parties are urged to sell their principles to each
other at a great reduction. The other kind of
majority rule is the kind where the Government
has not behind it an overwhelming party which
undertakes to say that the Government’s conduct
is wise and honorable even when it knows the
statement is a lie —where the Ministry has to live
by showing itself so fair, just and sagacious that
men who aren’t pledged to it, and even men who
are pledged to its enemies, are constrained to vote
for its measures. That is the sort of majority the
Watson Government is living on. It has a pre-
carious following which is to be relied upon only
so long as it is constrained to admit, often against
its will and against all the evil traditions of party
government, that the Watson policy is the best
that is offering. And the daily papers which
advocate coalition want to see this system abolished
and replaced by one under which Parliament will
vote for the Governmeet even though it recognises
that its policy is about the worst that is offering.
Meanwhile these papers fill in time by describing
the measure that is carried by 36 yotes against 24
as a shocking example of minority rule.

Bent, and How to Destroy Him.
The Victorian elections have left Bent still in
Eower, but with such a majority as will make the
olding of office a precarious and uncertain matter
for a man who takes his size in feet and falls over
them and himself at every turn. They have also
almost destroyed the old Opposition, the party
which went to the country in the hopeless position
of having been Peacock’s party, and having given
a weak-minded support to most of the atrocities of
the Irvine-Bent administration; and they have
increased the relative strength of the Labor party
by something like 100 per cent. There is, in all
this, some reason for gratification, but a good
deal more for disappointment. The one fact that
Victoria, at a general election, could return a
sufficient number of his followers to keep Bent
in power is in itself a ghastly reflection on the
popular intelligence and ability to distinguish hog
from human in the political stockyard. Bent
is a person who defies all the adjectives of the
English language ; the language confesses its de-
feat by falling back upon the term “ unspeakable ”
to express the feeling which all decent men hold
towards him. He has neither political nor private
character, and the proposals on which he stumped
the country were almost wholly suggestions for
cruelty, for repudiation and for tyranny. Yet
he was returned to power. His party lost
heavily; it received the warning of
what might be coming by the enormous
increase in the Labor vote. But it still holds the
Treasury benches. Yet there is this to be said for
Victoria —it would almost certainly have done
much better with a very little extra inducement.
Many Victorian electors, doubtless, voted Bent
because they were offered so very little practical
alternative. The Opposition party, led by
M‘Kinnon, was almost colorless. It seemed more
gentlemanly than the Bent party, but it had no
definite ideas of any size. In the previous
Parliament it had followed Irvine and Bent
in almost every iniquity. For the next
Parliament it promised better things under
M‘KiNNON, a personally decent man and a
moderate Liberal, but the promise was neither
very vigorous nor very distinct. There was no
sure guarantee to the electors that in voting for
an Opposition candidate they would not be voting
for a Bent supporter in disguise, and if one wants
to make a friend of a pig one may as well meet
him in his sty ; so they voted Bent. The key to
the position was in the hands of the Labor party,
but it refused to organise for a general victory,
and marshalled its forces only to cut off outposts.
With better tactics on the part of the Labor party
—to which fell the real responsibility of opposi-
tion —the result would have been very different.
Had it proclaimed that the destruction of Bent
was clearly the one pressing political duty
ahead; had it invited the Opposition to co-operate
in the task, insisting on that Opposition coming
to the alliance with a policy progressive enough to
fulfil reasonable reform requirements for the life
of one Parliament, and dropping members who
would not go that far ; had it further grappled
with the financial question, and put forward a
platform of economy without sweating, of sol-
vency without gaoling the sick poor, and of pro-
gress without borrowing—there would be another
Labor-Liberal Ministry forming in Melbourne
this month. But the Labor party had no such
statesmanlike grip of the situation. It put for-
ward what was, to all intents and purposes, a purely
negative platform of hostility to Bent, and said
not a word about taking up the duties and re-
sponsibilities of office when Bent’s political funeral
had been attended to. It asked the State to get
rid of Bent, and didn’t offer a successor. The
dreadful Tom Mann was sent raging through the
land with a portmanteau full of tattered adjec-
tives and moth-eaten perorations. The occasion
called for a definite reform programme—a declar-
ation that to overthrow Bent did not mean casting
the state into anarchy but the substitution of a
Cabinet, inexperienced perhaps, yet honest and
capable of making practical proposals. And the
occasion was met by an excited orator who used to
sell beer, calling on the populace to shake off its
manacles and prepare for the next bottle—or
battle. Manacles and battles don’t square the
revenue accounts, or provide a workable scheme
of government. Many a Victorian elector
who wanted to vote straight against Bent
didn’t see anything practical in voting on the
manacles issue. So much for the past; it is for
the Labor party now to face the future. ‘ Do
you know that I can’t believe in a personal God ? ”
said a “viewy” and would-be smart Oxford
student to Jowett, the master of his college.
“Well,” snapped Jowett, as he took out his
watch,’ “you find a belief in a personal God in
half-an-hour or leave the college.” In Australian
politics, nowadays, a financial policy is as virtually
necessary as was a belief to that student. 1 he party
that cannot find an honest financial policy must,
very shortly, whatever its views on other jioints,
retire from politics. To the Victorian Labor
members now The Bulletin urges: Show your-
selves to be practical men ; abjure Tom Mann and
the manacles tommy-rot; draw up a definite, con-
cise policy of administration, showing that you
can run the country without sweating the civil
servants, starving the aged poor, or shutting up
the hospitals ; if fresh taxation is necessary, don t
be afraid to propose it and, whether the step is
necessary from a revenue standpoint or not, go
solidly for absentee and graduated land taxes by
reason of their economic benefits. Do this and
offer to such of the Oppositionists as are genuinely
progressive the chance to co-operate with you on
fair terms. Then there will be an Opposition with
a policy, not an Opposition with a shriek. Bent,
under such circumstances, will not last long.

The Threatened Revolution of Joseph and the
Three Johns.
When The Bulletin went to press, Premier
John See, of N.S.W., was very angry over the
Federal capital problem, and Opposition-leader
Joey Carruthers was frantic or thereabouts.
This is John on the subject:—
When I was at Tumut, some time ago, I stated dis-
tinctly that I was absolutely opposed to the alienation of
a larger area than was provided for by the Constitution
Act, namely, 100 square miles. The Federal Parliament
may, therefore, just as well pass a resolution to take the
whole of New South Wales as to decide upon having 900
square miles.
And this is Joe : ~'v . . . A
I regret to notice the attitude of the Federal Senate on
the capital question. To attempt to “ filch ” away from
New South Wales 5000 square miles, or 3,200,000 acres, is
enough to open the eyes of the sleepiest amongst us as to
the intentions and feelings of the dominant factions
in the other States. And this proposal was for the
double purpose of robbing us and of creating a Com-
munistic settlement. . . . What is more probable is that
the time is not far distant when the people of N.S.W. will
demand one of two things, either a full recognition of the
spirit and the letter of the Federal compact or the with-
drawal of this State from a Federal union that is disfigur-
ing its early history with a callous violation of good faith
and a reckless disregard of honorable obligations. It will
not take very much to rouse the people of New South
Wales to the most united movement ever known in our
history directed against the Constitution as at present
administered.
Leaving out Joseph Carruthers’ outrageous and
contemptible lie to the effect that the Watson
Government intended establishing a communistic
settlement round the Federal city— Joseph’s
utter inability to fight fairly being too well known
to require comment —the business aspect of the
situation is now about this :
(1) N.S.W. accepted the Federal Constitution as at first
drafted, when it contained no proviso for fixing the
capital over 100 miles from Sydney, or for surrendering
any territory to the Federal authority.
(2) The State Parliament, at the instance of certain
members of the Carruthers party, annulled the people’s
vote.
(3) The Premier (Reid), in whose Ministry Carruthers
had a place, then got the Constitution amended by the
insertion of a clause providing that the capital was to be
100 miles or any greater distance from Sydney provided it
was in N.S.W., and that the Commonwealth Government
was to receive from N.S.W. 100 square miles or any
greater area to form a Federal territory. And N.S.W.
accepted the measure again, with these provisions that
the Carruthers party had insisted on dragging into it.
(4) The Federal Senate, which possibly knows some-
thing—all wisdom not being confined to Joe and John,
and their friend Johnny (whose other name is Haynes)
and their friend Jack (whose other name is Want)—
reckons that 900 square miles is about the right thing,
which is strictly constitutional seeing that Carruthers’
friend Reid got it decreed that the area should be any-
thing over 100 square miles. Also it proposes to fix the
capital over 100 miles from Sydney as provided by the
Constitution when it was refixed by Carruthers’ friend
Reid.
(5) The theory of Joe and John and Johnny and their
friend Jack is that N.S.W. won’t let the Commonwealth
have the area it regards as necessary, and won’t let any
other State supply the area. Also that the Constitution
is to be read (in defiance of what it says) as providing that
the capital territory is to be just 100 miles from Sydney and
is to consist of just 100 square miles. Likewise that these
four individuals are to decide what is the feeling of N.S.W.
on the matter, and the feeling of N.S.W., as interpreted
by Joe and the three Johns, is to outvote not only the
Constitution but the opinion of all the rest of Australia.
And if they can’t wholly run the show in this
fashion, Joey Carruthers threatens to revolushe,
as John Haynes did some months ago in a back
room of Sydney School of Arts.
Tlie N.S.W. Liberal and Deform Lolly.
The Bulletin has just received a sticky red,
white and blue object wrapped up in tissue paper,
which object proves, on inspection, to be the
N.S.W. Liberal and Deform lolly. It hails from
Redfern, and is apparently issued in the interests
of “ Alderman George W. llowe, J.P.,” who has
been selected to carry in that region the tattered
banner of the crowd that has no definite prin-
ciples. The party holds meetings in Redfern, and
announces itself by a small handbill the color of
freshly-killed beef ; and the usual Deformers talk
vaguely about “economy,” and refuse, amid a
mist of words, to say whether by “economy”'
they mean that they will give up borrowing or
only borrow about £4,000,000 a year regularly—in
fact, they flatly refuse to say what they mean.
But where Alderman George W. Howe’s sup-
porters are gathered together every lady receives,
instead of definite information, something the shape
of a newly-severed toe, but which is really a bit of
stickjaw worth about one-sixth of a penny. On
this there is an inscription urging the recipient in
impassioned blue and red remarks to give her vote
to Howe. The Carruthers party is out stiongly
after the woman voter ; some of its representatives
are trying to buy her with affability and a cup of
tea, while others offer a bright smile and a sticky
piece of boiled sugar. Sydney, in fact, is full of
Deform candidates urging the woman voter to
have a snack, and the electoral battle is only
beginning as yet. When it gets really hot other
varieties of refreshment will doubtless arrive on
the scene, and one Carruthers candidate will
press his claims with a pound of sausages, while
another speaks feelingly about the age of consent
while tendering a hot pie. Even the pig’s-trotter
candidate and the one who offers Jib. of bacon
may come in time. If anything could increase the
contempt of every healthy-minded citizen for the
whole sickly Carruthers push, this endeavor to
attract votes with a very small quantity of
some gummy and indigestible substance, worth
about 3|d. a lb., would do it. The Carruthers
party seems to live chiefly by offering something
drinkable to female deputations that call on it to
talk about illegitimacy, and by a general handing
round of broken victuals. It includes the small
‘ ‘ good ” candidate, the small pious candidate with
lank hair, the social purity candidate who rubs his
hands when talking to you, the little pale obstet-
rical-minded candidate, the candidate whose con-
versation Suggests that of a mild Baptist family
at tea on a wet Sunday, the shocked-curate
kind of candidate, the tea-meeting-and-bit-of-
eake candidate, and the lolly candidate.
It will probably yet include the underclothing
candidate. The conduct of the Carruthers
party will yet necessitate an amendment of the
N.S.W. Electoral Law—an amendment making it
unlawful for a candidate to offer any kind of wet
or sticky refreshment to a lady elector for at least
three months before polling day. Failing that,
N.S.W. will one day be ruled by a Toffee or Tea-
and-Bun Government, which will depend mostly
on the votes of young women in the gum-chewing
period of life, elderly afternoon-tea cats, and
people of the kind who admire “ East Lynne.”
A Bank “The Bulletin” Knows.
Those who join in the parrot-cryagainst “ Govern-
ment interference with the banking institutions of
the country ” ought to sit down quietly and think
over the recent history of the A.J.S. Bank. For
years past it professed to have a paid capital
of about £1,170,000. It showed, as against
this capital and several millions of deposits, bills,
advances, and other debts amounting to just upon
£6,000,000. It added that these assets were in-
cluded at “old valuations,” but it proffered
no new valuations. Year after year it has
issued these balance sheets, broadcasting them
through newspaper advertisements. And all the
time it knew perfectly well that the assets were
really worth so much less than the advertised
figures that it would require a sum equal to the
whole of the capital, and more, to make up the
deficiency. In January, 1897, a committee of
experts, appointed on behalf of British investors
to go into the whole position, found that on pas-
toral properties alone £611,569 had been lost—in
other words, that even at that time the assets of
this one class alone were worth that_ much less
than the amount at which they were included in
the advertised balance-sheet. And still the
fictitious figures (with the saving remark,
“at old valuations”) were put before the
Sublic subsequently no less than 13 times!
Iven now it is quite possible that nothing
would have been done, and that the same old
figures would have gone before the public for
an indefinite number of years longer, had it not
been for indirect Government interference —this
interference which is said to be so unnecessary
and so uncalled for. The fact was that the bank
had lent vast sums to Western tenants of N.S.W.
public lands, and when those tenants asked (for
about the 17th time) for better terms, including
still further reduced rents and a longer lease, the
Government hesitated. “We are perfectly willing
to help you,” it said in effect; “we quite recog-
nise that you have had a hard time; but even
if we do what you ask, you will not
benefit, because you are carrying an impossible
debt. Unless that debt is reduced, any conces-
sion we make would be not to you but simply to
the mortgagee.” Therefore, before any concession
was made, such an amount of the debt had to be
written off as to give the holder a reasonable
chance of keeping afloat ; and that forced the
A. J.S. Bank’s hand. If it didn’t write off part of
the debt, its mortgagors could get no concessions ;
in other words, it would, as the holder or man in
possession of many leases, have to go on paying the
old rate of rent, and its leases would not be
extended. If it did write off part of the debt,
then it would have to prick the pretty bladder
which it had been sending up for the public to
look at and admire for seven years past. Very
sensibly it decided to prick the bladder—to grab
the bone which the Government offered, and let
the silly old shadow slide. Of course the
daily papers, which are so sure that “ Government
interference ” in banking matters is quite unneces-
sary, say that at last the bank has done the proper
thing ; they even screw up courage to suggest that
it might well have done it before. But the fact
remains that through all these years it didn’t do
what was so obviously the proper thing, and
that even in the end it didn’t do it until this
“ Government interference ” happened. Also, it
is worth noting, though this “Government inter-
ference ” means pricking a pretty painted bladder,
it also means an actual saving to the bank and its
customers of probably £20,000 a year.
Agricultural Arbitration.
If the Australian Parliament decides to include
farm laborers in the Arbitration Bill it will do an
act which is strictly right, provided the Parlia-
ment is prepared to accept the responsibilities
which go along with it, and utterly wrong other-
wise. As the Federal Arbitration Act will only
apply to disputes which extend to more than one
State, the inclusion of farm workers might lead to
nothing in particular; yet, at the same time, it
might lead to a great deal. In any case there
would always be' a possibility of circumstances
arising under which it would be the duty of a
Federal court to order that the Australian farm
toiler should be paid a reasonable wage for reason-
able hours of work. Then the court would bring
up with a shook against the fact that many
tenant farmers in the western district of Victoria,
and in various regions of N.S.W. and S.A;, can't
pay a decent wage because of the outrageous rents
exacted from them by the great landholders.
If Parliament makes it a possibility that the
Federal courts will have to order the payment of a
fair wage, then it should set to work to abolish
the big landlord by a heavy graduated land-tax,
and to turn the rack-rented tenant farmer into a
small freeholder cultivating his own property, so
that he will be able to pay the fair wage when
ordered to do so. Further, the man who owns
and lets out 300 acres at an exorbitant rent re-
quires to be suppressed as much as the one whq
does the same with 60,000 acres. A tax on agri-
cultural rents is wanted in addition to the gradu-
ated land-tax. If land paid a rent tax when it
was occupied and cultivated by anybody save the
owner, and was free of rent tax when farmed by
the owner, there would be a constant tendency,
not only towards subdivision, but towards making
the owner and occupier of the sub-divided area the
same individual. That is a purpose which every
democratic Government should keep in. view. It
may not be land nationalisation, but it gets there
almost the same. After all, it matters very little
to the individual if he owns a one-millionth share
in the general public estate, or owns his one-
millionth as a separate bit with a fence round it,
and sometimes it is easier to let him have his own
bit with the fence around it.
The Democratic Government in Queensland is
finding out why, under the Piiilp “business-
man ” rule, the nigger was necessary on the sugar
plantations. This is one case :
A syndicate, owning land worth about 10s. an acre, got
an advance to erect a central mill. When the mill was
built (with Government money) the land was cut up and
sold for £lO an acre, the syndicate holding mortgages. The
mill was put into a 60,000 share co. ; the syndicate retained
58,000 shares. The actual cane-growers, mustering only
2000, had no power. The sharks paid themselves fees as
directors, managers, &c. So the cane-grower had to pay
(1) all the additional value (£9 10s.) which the Investment
of public money-had given to the land ; (2) interest on
the balance of the purchase money ; (3) interest (as cane-
growers) on the cost of the mill, which was far greater
than the actual area under cultivation warranted (the
syndicate was, of course, looking forward to selling more
land, and collaring more £9 10s. an acre unearned incre-
ment) ; (4) fees for the sharks ; (5) working expenses of a
mill run for the benefit of the sharks, and over which the
actual growers had no control.
The simple fact in this case was that cane-growing
wouldn’t support both syndicate-sharks and white
workmen, and the Philp crowd made things easy
for the sharks.

As a picture show, ‘ ‘ The Darling of the
Gods,” produced at Her Majesty’s, Sydney, on
Saturday night, is worth a guinea a visit. If the
scenery of Japan is so beautiful, if the golden
mists brood so softly over moon-flowers and lakes,
if the almond-petals carpet the garden paths so
thickly, and the sun sinks to rest so redly behind the
giant bamboos, and the moonlight is of such
ivory whiteness, no wonder Japan has become the
tourists’ Mecca. The nature-loving tourist, of
course. In fact, in “ The Darling of the Gods ” every
prospect pleases and only man is biled or other-
wise maltreated. But the wickedness is qualified
with courtesy. “Deign to graciously enter my
unworthy torture chamber,” says the Minister
for Assault and Battery to the outlaw whom
he has captured. There’s a jolt in the his-
torical accuracy of the drama. The Mikado’s
edict against the Samurai was issued in 1875, when
Japan was already pretty well Europeanized, and
when a Minister of State (or of no state) would
not be likely to run a torture-chamber on his pre-
mises. However, that trifling anachronism makes
no great difference, and the audience continues to
think it is looking at a play of mediaeval Japan.
Japan, in drama, is the place where anything may
happen so long as a fan happens along with it.
The drama, three hours long, is crowded with
incident, and the action goes with a rush that is
wonderful, considering its cumbrous skirts and
other tails and impedimenta. Swords are drawn
and daggers gleam, there is a midnight assassina-
tion, the groans of the tortured are heard, and before
each act a strange, banshee-like wailing arises
from afar. Yet the audience remains jocund. It
is deeply impressed (especially when the Minister
raises a trapdoor in the floor of his reception-room
and lets up the red glare of the hot chamber), but
it is never moved. It doesn’t take its Japan seri-
ously enough to be moved. It doesn’t even take
the noble rebel seriously, for who could rebel in
those clothes ? It just sees a swarm of admirably
manoeuvred lay figures fight, and dance, and make
love and torture, and bang and blare on strange
musical instruments against the most picturesque
of backgrounds. Maud Jeffries, as Yo-San, makes
up capitally as the romantic pagan child-woman
who, ‘ ‘ until three days ago, ” had lived in the temple
and found dancing before the gods “honorably
dull.” She is always on the stage, and always bleat-
ing in the thin little head-voice of the Jap ingenue,
but she has no acting worth the name. As for the
men’s roles, the secondary character of Zakkuri,
the sinister war-lord, is really the principal one.
E. A. Warburton takes this part and gives it a
very probable representation. If it was possible
for there ever to be a Minister who looked like
Mr. Warburton then the feeling that Mr. War-
burton looks like that Minister is irresistible.
Julius Knight, as the princely outlaw Kara, acts
as if he had been hypnotised and told to go
through his part j ust diplomatically. Yet probably
he acts it as well as such a lay-figure character
could be acted. The River of Souls and the cloudy
Paradise, in which the lovers meet after 1000
years of separation, are two of the finest tableaux
Sydney has ever looked upon.

“The Marriage of Kitty ” is still happen-
ing nightly and on Wednesday afternoons at the
Criterion; but “Cousin Kate” is in rehearsal,
and the new English Comedy Co. will soon be
seen in that recent Haymarket success, with
tragic “ Madame Butterfly” to keep it company.

The many bright and cheering features of
“Theßose of the Riviera ” have attracted crowded
houses to Sydney Lyceum during the week, and
the management hopes that the piece will last out
the necessarily short Sydney season. Someone
has carefully hung a number of local gags on the
projecting corners of the play. On the whole they
are bright gags, and have been hung to advantage.

If Herr Albert Friedenthal has not had
very full houses for his pianoforte recitals he has
had most attentive audiences. His listeners
hung on every note like a drowning inhabitant
clutching a straw, and listened as to music of the
spheres (whatever that may be). And when
at the close of each number he arose and tossed
his mane in a bow to worshippers, they
made as much appreciative noise as if the
Centenary Hall were filled to the doors.
Eriedenthal’s playing is justly described as
“scholarly” and “distinguished,” and anyone
who has once heard him play his adaptation of the
Storm Scene from “The Flying Dutchman” will
remember it all the time his mental musical-box
lasts.

“The Golden Ladder” will be withdrawn
from Sydney Royal at the close of this week, and
on Saturday “ The Price of Peace ” is to be staged.
The new piece is by the same author as “ The
Great Millionaire,” and is said to be of the same
type. “The Price of Peace” suggests naturally
the necessity for raising a loan—the price of every-
thing is raised here by the permanent and repro-
ductive loan.

That cheerful show, the Mutoscope, which
has been located in Sydney till it became almost
an institution, is to develop for a time into a
travelling entertainment. It goes up to Cairns
(Q.), and after giving that Chinaman-haunted
town good value for its money, it will work south
to Sydney again, and take up its abode in more
commodious quarters, which are now being got
ready for it. In the old premises, it was found
that the back of the man who was seeing why
Kitty put the light out, collided with the back of
the man who was trying to find out, at the other
instrument, why Catherine left the light in, and
the lack of space became aggravating.

Presumably as a delicate compliment to
the muscular development of Britain’s Heir Ap-
parent, Nawn’s co. added two boxers to the show
at the Palace on P. of W. Birthday. These two
—Arthur Cripps and Hock Keys—sparred a bit,
and then joined Nawn in a farce, “Fun in a
Gymnasium.” There is more genuine fun, though,
in Nawn’s revived comedietta, “Pat and the
Genii,” with Nawn, of course, in another of his
droll Irish characters. For the rest the excellent
variety show continues to scatter amusement and
keep its legs covered in the same refined manner
as hitherto.

Wrestler Carkeek’s engagement under the
Rickards management was for only 16 weeks, and
as Melbourne and Adelaide have yet to see the
vast Cornishman, Sydney will lose sight of him
this week—for a time, anyway. The hardest nut
he has yet met is Merzouk, the crazy-quilted
Algerian, whom he gripped last week and is grip-
ping again while this is being printed, unless some-
thing has happened which isn’t mentioned in the
advertisement. Grseco-Roman is Merzouk’s style
and it isn’t Carkeek's; therefore, Carkeek failed
last week to throw the Algerian gentleman in the
stipulated 15 minutes, and had to hand over £25.
Now the Algerian gentleman has undertaken to
throw Carkeek in 30 minutes, or hand the £25
back again. Nat Clifford has changed his turns ;
the last week is announced of May Moore Duprez,
whose “business” isn’t what it was when she
started ; and the little Scotch balladist continues
to deserve a good word.

J. S. Ryan and his comedy co. have been
responsible for a certain amount of excitement, at
Sydney Queen’s Hall, with a two-act play entitled
“Night and Morning.” It is a title of infinite
possibilities, suggesting all manner of cheerful
riots, and a head next day; and it caught
the public eye and brought good houses to see
what it was all about.
At feeble song or feebler dance
The moody poet looks askance,
And wonders —Why that extra shilling ?
“George Edwardes’s Famous London Co.”
previously introduced to Melbourne (at the
Princess’s) in a somewhat unique musical play is
now showing what it can and can’t do in an
ordinary musical comedy. “ Three Little Maids ”
can be very effectively presented in a quiet style
by a co. which has not one fetching vocalist
or first-class dancer in the crowd. “The Girl
from Kay’s ” for the most part needs to be played
with plenty of dash, broad humor and “variety”
talent, as far as the principals are concerned,
and furthermore there are good opportu-
nities for a brilliant chorus. The whole of
Saturday’s performance was open to unfavor-
able comparison with the brightest work of
the Williamson Comic Opera Co. The girls
in the background are not pretty, the chorus
men not smart. Melbourne expected something
better from a co. that is labelled “George
Edwardes, London.” Nevertheless the general
public, for whom “Three Little Maids ’’ had
no attractions, will probably prefer this produc-
tion, because there is more movement and melody
in it. The music is graceful, the song words are
catchy, and the broken story has some sharp,
satirical points. Also, it depicts a bride forlorn,
and women are naturally fond of mournful bridal
scenes.
* * * *
Hoggenheimer, a shocking German Jew
millionaire, wanders ponderously through the
three acts in chase of the artful drapery girl from
Kay’s. George Huntly imparts to this gorged
capitalist some of the same slow mannerisms which
marked Lord Cheyne in the previous piece, but
his artistic make-up and his German accent give
the old characteristics a new interest. Hoggen-
heimer seems to spend all his spare time in pur-
chasing beauty’s smile. He mentions his notorious'
name to a girl as though he were a dead sure
buyer, and she enters into negotiations at once.
The simple directness of Hoggenheimer’s method
compels a certain amount of reverence.
Maurice Earkoa is exactly the same amorous
Anglo-Erenchman as before, differently circum-
stanced. He kisses the tricky girl from Kay’s on
his wedding day, and his bride (Miss Delia MasOn)
catching him in the act, denies him all the com-
forts of a honeymoon until she has grown tired of
being estranged. Their duet, “Semi-detached,”
is the most pleasing musical number in the show.
Miss Mason is the typical sentimental young angel
—rather insipid, but exceedingly graceful, with an
educatedhalf-tone voice. Miss Ryan, as a frivolous
lady’s maid, and Miss Madge Crichton, in the name
part, are rather weak when they sing and dance, and
there is no air of importance about anything they
do. Miss Hobson is out of her element as a weak-
minded mother-in-law; George Carroll imper-
sonates a dwarf hall-porter. Edward Fraser and
R. St. George do a grave injustice to their respec-
tive character parts. The one has a little humor
and no force, the other is loud, aggressive and
humorless. But this namesake of England’s
patron saint appears to be only one of several im-
ported people whose presence suggests a note of
interrogation.

The much-rescued lady and her dumb
cheeild-in-arms will retire from Melbourne Royal
stage on Friday, to make way for “ The Great
World of London,” an Andersonian flower of
literature which has not yet bloomed in Mel-
bourne. Thirty-nine previous articles at the same
house have carried “London” in their titles, but
none of them amounted to quite the same thing as
this. Much spectacular effect is promised for the
forthcoming production, and Anderson’s piomise
in such matters spells Performance, with a loud P.

Her Majesty’s, of Melbourne, is for the

ments. It will be open again to an anxious public
on Saturday, 18th, when the cigar of Sherlock
Holmes will once again glow like a thirsty citizen’s

The Opera House parts company with the
Bells and the Empire Girls this week. Those
estimable half dozen of trade unionists are to
shake their friendly toes at the audience for the
last time on Friday. Then Carkeek will come
along and wrestle for a living.
Madame Freid-Griselda, the Californian
soprano, gives concerts at Melb. Town Hall on
the 16th and 18th. Madame has engaged a pro-
fessional orchestra of 50 performers to surround
her on these occasions, and Alberto Zelrnan will
control the musical force.
*« * *
At Adelaide Tivoli an assorted Rickards
co. is doing well, with the Uessems as the star
attraction. Wilson and Morris put in a good
Chinese turn, and in these days of Japanese
alliances the intelligent monkey, Darwin, gives
much food for thought. The bioscope pictures of
Hackenschmidt are interesting; but Adelaide
hasn’t seen any wrestling for so long that it
had forgotten what it is like, and is rather
disappointed to find that it chiefly consists of
one big man grovelling on a mat, while another
big man perseveringly paws him all over. Worth’s
circus has moved off, after giving some extra
nights. At the Royal “A Stranger in a Strange
Land ” is running its mixed Red Indians for one
week only. But Stine at the Tivoli, at 3-2-1, has
rather spoiled the market for Willoughby
in much the same kind of drollery at 5-3-1.
Also, South Australia is just now spending all
its spare cash on skating, in fancy dress and
otherwise, at the Jubilee Exhibition building.
The bard might praise
“ The Girl from Kay’s,”
Despite its lack of chorus-frilling,
Nor would he raise,
In sad amaze,
His eyebrows at the gentle trilling
Of voices which are small, but sweet,
Nor sigh because the ladies neat
Can’t dance like some we often meet
In shows with less pretentious billing,
//—underline the mighty “ if”—
The tariff did not make a dif.
’Twixt this and shows more gay and thrilling.
The Wild Cat Column.
Sydney papers report that, on the matter of the
capital site, mild J. T. Walker “ fought a valiant battle in
the Senate in the interests of N.S. Wales.” On the clause
that the area be 900 square miles, he “ moved to make the
area 100 square miles, which was the area mentioned in
the Constitution.” Now the Constitution says “not less
than 100 square miles.” Part of the present constitution
of the A.M.P. is that no premium of less than £l. shall be
accepted. Presumably J. T. Walker, who has been a
director of the A.M.P. for many years, therefore regards
£1 as the amount mentioned in the A.M.P.’s constitution,
and will hereafter fight a valiant battle against anybody
being permitted to pay in more than £l.

The financial year of all the Commonwealth
States except Tasmania will close on June 30; and Tas-
mania will, to get in line with the rest, also begin a new
year on July 1. With the returns for 11 months more or
less available, it is therefore now.possible tog-et some idea
as to what size in deficits the States will take this year.
As to Victoria, however, nothing definite can be said ;
there is nothing to go upon save Bent’s electioneering
say-so that that State has a surplus. And, in any case,
there are various ways of making a surplus. One way is
to steal it by bringing forward the previous year’s surplus,
which may itself have been stolen out of t.-ust or
sinking funds in the first place; and thus make the
one stolen surplus do two years running. Every other
State, except possibly S. Australia, is booked for a deficit;
but it is still in doubt whether N ( S.W. or Westralia will
have the largest on the actual operations of the year.
The past month showed a falling-off in revenue
in most cases :—-

May, 1903, was the month when Bent was completing his
triumph as a railway administrator by bringing- traffic to
a standstill; so that the comparison in the Victorian case
doesn’t count. There >*Vere also extraordinarily heavy
excise payments last' month. The small decrease in
N.S.W. resulted mainly from a large falling--away in
Customs and land revenue, partly counter-balanced by
a substantial improvement in railways (£278,470 against
£257,109). Bringipg together the revenue for the whole
year so far as figures are available, these results show
up:—

In N.S.W. railway revenue has been £124,250 more than
last year, and land revenue £81,089 more ; but Common-
wealth refunds (Customs) have been £168,900 less.

S. Australia (9 mos.) 1,820,029 1,877,932 Inc. 57,903
Victoria does not publish expenditure returns, which
makes it easier for a Treasurer to predict a huge deficit
during the year, and subsequently, when the deficit
doesn’t materialise worse than usual, to pose as a statesman
who has saved his country. Tasmania is in the same
position ; and S. Australia publishes figures only once a
quarter.
The general position so far as it can be made
out compares with that of two years past in this way:—

1902. 1903. 1904.
Queensland (11 mos.) £156,213 £281,981 £500,289
The actual Queensland deficits as at May 31st have been
approximately :—1902, £464,000 ; 1903, £354,000 ; 1904,
£145,000. Compared with last year N.S. Wales is £138,680
better ; S.A., £37,868 worse ; Westralia, £350,662 worse ;
and Queensland, about £209,000 better. In the last month
of the year large payments are usually made to N.S. Wales’
revenue ; last year these and other adjustments reduced
the actual deficit to £171,166. This year, however, no
large final refunds will come from the Commonwealth, as
they did last year, so that Treasurer Waddell may have a
deficit of about £200,000. Westralia began the year with
an accumulated credit balance of £231,659, all but £54,804
of which has now disappeared ; and as the June
expenditure is usually heavy, it is highly probable
that the Westralian year’s deficit will exceed £200,000,
and get ahead of N.S. Wales’ shortage. In Victoria
Bent boasts that his surplus will be £500,000. How
S. Australia will end up it is impossible to say, as
the Treasury may receive a windfall from the death duties
on the Angas estate, or it may not. If, however, the cur-
rent quarter pans out the same as the corresponding
quarter of last year (when there was a moderate windfall),
there will be a deficit on June 30th of £38,000 —apart,
that is, from the chronic Northern Territory deficit.
Queensland continues to make good progress in getting
out of the awful bog into which a succession of syndicate
Governments landed it.

ing loan expenditure :

The N.S.W. total for the 11 months is £2,305,903, which is
£2,169,614 less than for 11 months of 1903. Last month,
only £74,810 was spent on this account, which was the
least for any month for many years past.

Ex-Treasurer Turner’s Estimates, at which
several of the State Treasurers scoffed early in the year,
are proving remarkably accurate. Below are his figures

the figures for 12 months assuming that June collections
are the average of those of the past 11 months :

Ex-Treasurer Cribb, of Queensland, was the most furious
over Turner’s estimate, and, refusing to accept the latter
figures, bumped them up several thousands on his own
account; yet even Turner’s figures have not been reached
in that State. Oribb’s juggle was fairly characteristic
of the way in which Queensland finances have been run
by Philp politicians, and explains a good deal of how the
chronic deficit has been managed. N.S. Wales may ex-
pect to get over £170,000 in excess of the estimate. And
still it will probably end up with a deficit of about
£200,000. In other words, after it has squared the other
bills, there will be £200,000 of interest due which it will
have to pay with borrowed money, notwithstanding that
it has a phenomenal harvest, and the revenue has been
£170,000 in excess of the estimate in one line alone.

Carruthers, M.L.A., leader of the Down-with-
Socialism party, pleading to a audience at Forest Reefs,
a N.S.W. mining centre : “His party would erect State
batteries on poor men’s fields so as to give a chance to
the working miner to g-o on his own. If by an expendi-
ture of £50,000 capital and £5OOO a year, they could erect
and run 50 batteries with 10 head of stampers, giving an
inducement to 1000 miners to win2s,ooooz. of gold a year,
valued at £lOO,OOO, they would thereby increase the wages
fund of the country by that amount each year, for all
time.’’ (Cheers and “ Hooray.”) Here is something
definite from Joseph at last. He is in favor of spending
loan money on a large socialistic experiment in the way
of State batteries to aid miners. And he thinks gold-
mining lasts “ for all time.”

The Wilfley Concentrator has now reached a
very exalted position in the Concentration industry. It
had been long recognised that older types of concentrators
were unsatisfactory in many respects, being small in
capacity, intricate in construction, costly in maintenance,
difficult of adjustment and required constant supervision ;
but the “Wilfley,” while retaining all advantages that
may have been possessed by its predecessors, was superior
to them in the following important respects. It will
handle several times more material than any belt con-
centrator made, without exception. It will save a higher
percentage of the values than any other table, and will
catch any float gold, amalgam, or quicksilver which may
escape from the amalgamating plates. It will make
cleaner and more valuable concentrates, thus saving use-
less expense for transportation of valueless material, and
also reducing the smelter charges. It requires little or no
attention when once adjusted, and no expert is required,
either to adjust or run the machine. It handles the
pulp with less power and less floor space per ton than any
other concentrator. It has no expensive belts to crack
and wear out and no complicated machinery to keep in
repair. The Sole Agents and Manufacturers for Australia
are the Austral Otis Engineering Company, Limited,

Hampton Plains Estate (W.A.) has recently
been boring on the Hampton Boulder, which contains a
big formation about 200 ft. wide, and the results have been
satisfactory, if any result from a borehole can be called
satisfactory. At a depth of 138 ft. a lode was met with
averaging about 12dwt. for a width of Bft. At 164 ft. a
second lode averaging 9£dwt. for Bft. was pierced. At 338 ft.
a third lode 2ft. wide and worth 3oz. was met. If these
finds should by any chance be confirmed, the co.’s position
will be greatly improved. On the surface the lode on
the Hampton Boulder is very patchy, nearly all the gold
being found in nuggety pieces with practically no fine
gold. This is very deceptive, as one dish of dirt may give
a phenomenal prospect, while the next dozen yield
nothing. The lode is too big, and the gold too patchy,
to prove payable.

While Carruthers is pursuing Treasurer Waddell
in the latter’s district, and imploring Cowra to throw
Waddell over in favor of Tom Bose, who used to know
better till he became a barrister, it is just as well to see
what sort of a mess it was that was made by the Govern*
ments of which Joseph was a member. There were two
of them—the first led by Henry Parkes ; the second by
Beid, Parkes’ enemy and supplanter. The first lasted
most of ’B9, all ’9O, and to nearly the end of ’9l; the
second from 1894 to July, 1899 ; and here are the official
records of those periods :

Net Deficits .. £1,427,427
It s a very fine record for any man to chase a Treasurer
with. Carruthers says that Waddell, if he was against
running into debt, ought to have resigned from the Cabi-
net, and that, as he didn’t resign, he must be held account-
able. There isn’t any record of Carruthers having
resigned while Beid was busy piling up his £607,523
deficit, or his £207,367 deficit; therefore Carruthers must
be held accountable for those deficits, which easily knock
out the worst yet accomplished by the present Govern-
ment. The See-Owe’Sullivan-Waddell Ministry’s three
years’ misbehavior has been as follows :
Deficit
1900- .. .. ..£117,319
1901- 12,749
1902- 171,166
Total .. .. £301,234
Even if Waddell accomplishes a £200,000 deficit this year,
his average will be only £125,000 a year, as against the
spotless Joseph’s £190,000 a year. Moreover, when
Joseph didn’t clear out from temptation in 1891, as he
says Waddell should have done in 1903, the N.S.W. wheat
yield averaged £2 os. lOd. per acre ; and still there was a
deficit (for which Carruthers, on his own showing, must
be held responsible) of £442,488. In Waddell’s three
years the average value of the wheat yield per
acre has been only £1 3s. Bd., and has never been
more than £1 16s. 3d. In 1895-6 Carruthers also
was responsible for a deficit of £607,523 ; and the wheat
harvest was worth £1 17s. per acre, or better than
Waddell’s best, when he got his deficit down to £12,749.
In 1896-7 there was another Carruthers’ deficit of £207,367,
and the wheat harvest figured out at £2 3s. sd. per acre.
Thus, on the only occasions he ever had to show what he
could really do if he had the chance, Carruthers, though
helped by exceptionally favorable conditions, did infinitely
worse than Waddell has done, and never showed any in-
clination or ability to do anything better. In fact, he
doesn’t seem able to see that anything better is called for.

Premier Jimmy, of Westralia, who can’t make
out why people won’t take him for a red-hot radical, got
a cheer at Collie the other day for talking about coal-mine
nationalisation ; he didn’t see, he said, why the State
should not take over the Collie mines. If Zeb. Lane
hadn’t been so far away he would certainly have
said, “Hear, hear,” with great emphasis. Premier
Jimmy apparently had Seddon’s M.L. experiment
in mind. But the position in Westralia is that
if the State knocked off taking coal from Collie, the
mines would shut up tight. Last year their whole out-
turn was 133,250 tons, of which 105,000 tons were taken
by the Bailways alone, and some more by other State
departments. If, therefore, the State ceased to be a cus-
tomer, at something above a fair market price, these
mines would have practically no value ; yet it is tolerably
certain that if the State proceeded to take over the mines,
as Premier Jimmy suggests, it would have to pay a pretty
large figure—assuming that Premier Jimmy acted up to
his reputation. To get at what the State ought fairly to
pay if it did take these mines over, it would be simply
necessary to find out what the shows would be worth sup-
posing the State did what Westralian private consumers
appear to be doing so unanimously—either opened up a
new mine of its own (as Seddon has done) or
bought from some other field. As it is, it seems that the
whole value of the Collie mines is created by the State
buying their coal and giving them special concessions in
railway rates for their coal. Now, does Premier Jimmy
propose that the State should pay for the mines at their
value with special State support, or at their value without
special State support ?

The yarn that capital is being rushed out of
Australia, and that the country is rapidly going to ruin
through Democratic legislation, looks particularly silly
when the extent of bank deposits now and 10 years ago is
compared. Here are the sworn averages for the first
quarter of 1894 and 1904 respectively :
First Quarter, First Quarter,
lfiQ4 IQO4- Tnorpiispti
Commonwealth.. £87,313,496 £90,302,569 £2,989,073
Maoriland .. 14,153,756 19,154,581 5,000,825
The one State which shows a very considerable decrease
(which, however, the other States have far more than
counterbalanced) is Victoria; and Victoria is the State
which hasn’t even yet recovered from the raid made upon
its credit by the deplorably incompetent crowd that ran
its financial affairs from 10 to 15 years ago. Moreover,
it is a State in which the Labor party has never got a
firm footing, in which the House of Bich Landlords still
hangs on to the neck of the community, and where Bent,
himself a land-bank boomer, is still possible as a Premier.
And the State which has had the greatest increase in
deposits is Maoriland, which has also had most of the sort
of government that is alleged to do the scaring and
ruining. On a population basis, the figures are :
Deposits per Head of Population.
First Quarter, First Quarter,

Commonwealth .. £25 14 0 £23 14 0 Dec. £2 0 0
Maoriland .. .. 21 1 0 24 12 0 Inc. 3 11 0
Victoria—Bent’s State—is almost wholly responsible for
the shrinkage so far as the Commonwealth is concerned ;
that State has lost £3 6s. per head of population, which
is about what Maoriland —the State of Ballance and
Seddon —has gained. This high protective tariffs, liberal
land laws, and arbitration courts seem to attract the
capital which incompetent bank directors, land boomers,
and Irvine and Bent scare away.
* * * *
Of its 900 habitable properties in the Sydney
Harbor resumed area, N.S.W. Government had only 15
empty the other day. Since the State went into the busi-
ness of landlord it has reduced rents in many cases 15 per
cent., and has spent liberally on repairs; also in “the
Bocks” area it is alleged that there have been only three
bailiff’s sales since Bill Lyne took possession. It is satis-
factory to find that the State is a considerate landlord;
but, all the same, it has to remember that landlording is
a business (run, moreover, on borrowed money) and not
either a charity or a scheme for -getting votes ; and the
candidate who tries to get votes from the tenants by de-
nouncing the rents as too high needs sitting on hard.

uoon them the dividend represents 20 per cent, per annum.
If anything like present rate of profits can be maintained,
it looks as though the co. might have got a good deal
more from the new issue to add to the already very fine
reserve fund. Of the assets, £114,731 are sunk in hotel
properties, from which nothing has been written off cost
since 1896. Of the rest, £59,/18 is in brewery land and
buildings, from which also nothing has been written off
cost since 1896. These two items stand for £174,449—the
whole of the reserves and about half of the capital and
nothing has been written off since 1896, an< *
that only £1350. The remarkable progress of Perth ma,y
have justified this ; yet, as extremely rapid progress is
often followed by something equally rapid in the way of
a slump, it might be just as well for shareholders and the
co. not to take their reserves too seriously. At present,
certainly, the co. is having a glorious time; net profits on
shareholders’ funds last half-year were at the rate of about
29 per cent, per annum. And, as far as can be made out,
the profit seems to be in the beer ; anyway, it is on
trading account, for the freehold hotel properties don t
seem to be returning much above 9 per cent, gross.

N.S.W., having now got what looks like a rea-
sonably settled policy of Protection in a small way, has
just established its first wine distillery for the production
of pure brandy. The first Australian election took place
in March, 1901 ; by the end of the year Protection for
Australian industries was a settled thing ; in January,
1902, a distillery co. was formed among the Hunter
Yalley vignerons ; and last week, close upon 100,000
gallons having already been distilled, “Success to the
Oo.” was drunk in Sydney in the co.’s own spirit.

As a result of Sydney Gas Co.’s brassy effort to
meet the various municipalities’ rating of their mains by
sticking on an extra £1 per street lamp per year, Wil-
loughby Council has decided to have its own gas works ;
Ashfield Council has decided to inquire as to the possi-
bilities of municipal electric light; Leichhardt Council
has discovered that there is sufficient power going to
waste from its garbage destructor to. supply the borough
with electric light; and other municipalities. are calling
meetings to devise schemes for gas or electric light. With
a Creater Sydney one comprehensive gas scheme would
be possible, and it could cut prices at least 33| per cent.

The Bull co. which owns the Perth tramways
had its meeting lately, but the dividend which was said
to be coming wasn’t mentioned. Receipts “ showed a
substantial increase,” and that sort of thing ; but, as a
matter of fact, the div. on the 6 per cent, cumulative
preference shares to June 30, 1902, was only paid during
last year, when power to borrow another £50,000 was
also got. Co. now struggles with £lOO,OOO 6 per cent,
cumulative preference shares, £lOO,OOO ordinary shares,
£198,203 5 per cent, first mortgage debentures, in addition
to the £50,000 authorised last year. All its proceedings
are kept pretty dark.

The only weak point seems to be that almost the whole of
the funds, both shareholders’ and trust, are in mortgages
and real estate ; £14,305 belonging to shareholders and
£168,705 belonging to trust estates is thus accounted for,
and of the balance only £5OOO is in State securities. This
is no doubt the way to make big profits ; but in a State
like Westralia, which is fast working out what are pre-
sumably its richest gold deposits, it looks risky.

“F.C.” : At times I doubt the sanity of people
who deal in land, as also of many who go on it. Lately I
inquired the history of an 18-acre block beyond Ring-
wood, 20 miles from Melbourne. It lies between two
roads, unfenced, and was bought from a fruitgrower in
the boom days for £lOO an acre. The inevitable bank
holds it now and wants £2O an acre, though better land
can be got five miles nearer town for £lO. A year or two
back some sanguine individual started to buy five acres of
the block, carted thither a four-roomed w.b. cottage,
built on a brick kitchen, chimney, etc., half fenced his
property—then abandoned the whole outfit. To-day the
cottage is.fast disappearing, as swaggies are not particular
what they use for firewood. Singular to say there still
remains in one of the front rooms a big circular table of
deal, stained to resemble mahogany. It has no doubt
proved too big for a single person to annex and too tough
for campers to break up.

The Victorian and Tasmanian breweries are
still tearing one another’s profits out. Last year, the four
big Melbourne breweries made a net profit of £6539 on a
paid capital of £485,336 and a debenture and mortgage
debt of £1,401,184. When they put up the price of beer
to end this appalling state of things, the Tasmanian
breweries cut in. The Melbourne combine then sent
across a few barrels of beer for Speck consumption, by
way of a hint, which the Tasmanians didn’t take. Now
the combine has bought two Hobart pubs., and is bidding
for the Speck thirst at 2d. a time.

Broken Hill is getting anxious about its water
supply again. It has had no rain since last December.
The Pinnacles, which is not connected with the Water
Co.’s service, has had to shut down its mill.
* * * *
About the most remarkable development made
in the last couple of years by Broken Hill Prop, is the
smelting of concentrator slimes, which for years were
practically refuse. Three years ago co. tried what could
be done by roasting them in open kilns. It was found
that they "carried enough sulphur to sinter themselves,
with the help of a handful of wood as a start. Since then
other changes have been made at Pt. Pirie which allow
of still more of this former refuse being used, till now
about 10,000 tons a month are going away—first to be
kiln-roasted or sintered a few miles outside Broken Hill ;
then on to Pirie to be smelted. Profit worked out a while
ago at £1 per ton, and further economies in handling,
&c., have been made since then.
* * * *
Official estimate of ore in sight in British Broken
Hill at the beginning of this year, 344,000 tons; since
when something more than the odd 44,000 tons have been
taken out. The supply would last only about two years
more at present rate of going. Twice before the co. has
been stuck up for want of ore and had to close, and it will
be in the same hole again if it doesn t look lively. In the
circumstances, the recent div. should certainly not have
been paid, as it left the co. with a credit balance of on y
£3230. On last published figures profit equalled only
2s. Id. per ton of ore, which, with a market like that for
lead, is too narrow a margin to feel comfortable on.

“ C.P.” : Just put in a fortnight’s exploration
of the sandstone ranges between Capertee Valley and the
Windsor-Singleton Road (N.S.W.). Evidently an archi-
pelago at one time ; creeks walled with cliffs, and full of
caverns hollowed by ancient surf. Much struck by the
probabilities of shale and oil discoveries. The Glen Alice
Coal and Shale Co. holds properties on the Capertee
River. Seams are under sandstone cliffs on side of
the stream, and vary from three to four feet. They have
been traced for several miles ; it really appears as if they
lay under the sandstone everywhere. A little tunnelling*
has been done by the co., but the development isn t much.
Five years ag*o writer saw the river running* under a film
of oil, and no doubt in time “gushers" will be struck.
The country is less known than Centralia. In 500 square
miles there is no permanent inhabitant, and m a fort-
night’s travelling writer saw no one. Systematic pro-
specting should give good results.

“Sessil” : The workers in the N.S.W. Shale
Co.’s ground, at Airlie (N.S.W.), are in a chronic state of
strike. They urg*e, with good reason, that their wages
are inadequate to the risk. Hardly a man escapes wounds
and gashes about the face. A leading wether or two may
make good money, but this is no criterion of general
earnings.

A syndicate is to test very promising beach
sands on N.S.W. north coast; prospects said to be
excellent. Victorian and English capitalists are also
nibbling. Cyanide or plates suggested as best treatment,
gold being extremely fine.
“ Sessil ” : What a farce the Mining on Private
Properties Act is! As the owner can refuse right-of-way
unless the prospector pays for a new road, and can deny
either timber or water, it is, nine times out of ten, far
better to come to terms with him in the old-fashioned
way. Like many more ostensibly liberal measures, its
liberalism lies chiefly in its title.

Accounts of the Tarcoola Blocks G.M. Co.
show what it costs to run a mine in far north S. Australia.
The mine is about the biggest S. Australia has at work
now ; last half-year (to April 21st) it returned 33540 z. gold,
an average (including cyanide gold) of nearly loz. sdwt.
Yet, after writing off £l5OO for depreciation of plant, a
profit of only £2B remains. The co. seems to be getting
pretty deep into the mire; it has sundry creditors for
£6404, and its liquid assets amount to considerably less
than half that.

Chairman Green, of New Moon Co., Bendigo,
in reply to The Bulletin’s question why, with nine years
stone in sight, the co. did not increase its output instead
of workina' for other shows : “ We have only one shaft to
work through. To get air we sometimes break through to
the South New Moon (south); other times we have to
go to the Suffolk (north). Although The Bulletin
says the New Moon is a big mine, it has only from 800 to
1000 ft. on the line of reef and can be worked from one
shaft. To sink another shaft and keep it going would
about double the cost of development work. We might
then work out the ground faster, perhaps even faster than
we could get on with the development work, but at
greater cost, and in the end the shareholders would not
get as much in divs. There have been too many
instances in mining where payable stone has been
rushed out at great cost, and afterwards co.’s had
to make calls to do the development work which
should have been done while the gold was being taken
out; and many mines have been shut down through that
system of working. We are working from seven different
levels and are getting about as much work done through
the shaft as we can venture to do, as there are many other
things to be attended to besides raising stone. Most, if
not all, shareholders appear satisfied with the manage-
ment, and we think they have reason to be, as the mine
has been worked for the benefit of the shareholders, not
for the market, and very few mines can boast this record
for eight years :—Crushed, 195,999 loads for 79,4540 z. of
gold, value £314,628 ; average per load, Bdwt. 2gr. ; divs.,
£157,800 ; expended in machinery, £20,248.”
Waldemar Lindgren, U.S. geologist, playing
the part of Dr. Peters to alluvial mining in Victoria, gives
for Bull’s delectation the following estimates : —Moolort
goldfields, lead 800 ft. wide, length 20,000 ft., equal to
443,000 fathoms, value £3 a fathom, total £1,329,000,
profit £400,000 ; Loddon Valley goldfields, lead 500 to
1000 ft. wide, wash worth £1,700,000, one-third profit ;
Options Blpck, payable ; Victorian Deep Leads, profit per
running foot of five miles, £l5. Let’s ask Lindgren a few
questions :—As the wash has never been entered in one of
Bull’s mines at Moolort, how does he know that the run of
gold is not confined to 100 ft. of the gutter ? And, for the
matter of that, how can he know the gold is there at all ?
How can he know, even if gold is there, that it will average
£3 a fathom, and how can he tell that one-third of the
value of the dirt will come back as profit, for that is not
the universal experience in Vic. ? What right has he to
assume that he will, by simply pumping from reef-drives,
get the wash dry (vide the experience of the West Berry
Consols and other mines, where bands of pug have to be
tapped) ? And how can he tell, from the bit of pumping
done so far at any of the Moolort mines, what water he will
have to contend with in the miles of gutter to be
drained ? Lindgren used honestly tell the men he met
on the fields that he knew nothing about Australian alluvial
mining. They believed him, and they can’t think, after
reading what they have seen of his report in the Arous,
that his mining education has been much improved
during his six months’ stay in Victoria. Another expert,
Daly, reported on some of the Moolort mines before they
were passed on to Bewick, Moreing and Co. He said
they were seas of undergrouild water. Is he to wear the
fool’s cap or U.S. geologist Lindgren ?
* * * »
Perhaps it was not nice to kick Henry Gore,
ex-M.L.C., off the Prentice and Southern, Rutherglen
(Vic.) board, but it was inevitable. He told Visick and
Morey and Boyd six months ago they were wrong about
the gutter, and the fact that he was right didn’t help him
a bit. Gore is old enough to know that it’s a fool who
decries a best girl to her man. He ought to have taken
his licking over the London deal quietly. In addition,
whether rightly or wrongly, he was credited with having
had a hand in pointing out to the Government that the
co. was slack in its interest payments. Altogether, from
different causes, he was impossible to the present board,
and so had to go. However, as he was right as to the
time it will take to get the wash dry, he goes down with
colors flying. That’s some consolation to a gritty sport.
* * * *
Somebody whispered the news about striking
the wash to the north in the Great Southern Consols,
Rutherglen (Vic.), before it reached the public, and shares
were snapped up smartly. Those who lost their scrip are
whimpering.
* * * *
West Berry Consols’ (Creswick, Yic.) share-
holders shuddered when yield dropped to 50oz. Squire,
the mine manager, was hustled down from the mine, and he
proved the fall was only temporary, caused by loss of time
through shifting men from one rise to another. He says
that he can promise 1400 z., and if so, the co. ought to
wipe off overdraft. The claim never had any luck.
* * * *
Most sensational drop at Bendigo of late has
been United Ulster’s decline to 245. ; but it ought to
have been expected, for no one dare say that the co. has
that value stone in sight in the mine. However, a fair-
sized block of good dirt has to be broken down at 900 ft.,
and that will keep the pot boiling.
* * * *
Manager Browne, at the Spring Hill Leads,
Creswick, is getting the water under splendidly. Some
talk about it being out in a fortnight, but that is too san-
guine. It might be found, after all, that the “ burst,”
though costly, will be cheap in the end by bringing the
water away in a lump.
* * * *
This is the sort of stuff sent from Ballarat: —
“ Lode north of crosscourse in Britannia United carries
good rough gold, and is heavily charged with minerals.
The material is regarded as payable.” If good coarse
gold and a high percentage of minerals doesn’t mean pay-
dirt, what does?
* * * *
White Heather Main Reefs, Kanowna (W.A.),
is in a pretty sad condition, as before the management
was passed on to Bewick, Moreing and Co., nearly every-
thing of value had been rooted out. The return for
January totalled 1600 oz. bullion ; while, since 8., M. and
Co. took charge, the output has dropped to 850 oz. fine
gold, and is "likely to drop further. Pollard, the new
manager installed by 8., M. and Co., has been withdrawn
and placed in charge of the Perseverance. 8., M. and Co.
have managed to reduce costs, and apparently are now
able to treat lower grade ore. This, however, is simpli-
fied by using “ short ” tons. “ Short tons ”is a very con-
venient and very elastic expression. The net result for
April panned out a profit of £5 only, which won’t leave
much for directors’ fees after paying for cables. The
taking over of a mine in such a depleted condition
doesn’t say much for the astuteness of 8., M. and Co.
* * * *
As expected, Queen Margaret, Bulong (W.A.),
has not scored much by firing out tributors. During the
six months mine was under tribute, co.’s royalty averaged
£9OO monthly from an average gold yield of IOOOoz. Dur-
ing this time, co. itself only averaged about 200 oz.
monthly. For April, co. won 1350 z. fine gold from 647
tons, while the solitary tribute party won 1330 z. from 27
tons. Manager Davies gives costs as follows: —Mining,
Is. lid. ; treatment, 3s. Bd.—total, ss. 7d. per ton. This
looks imposing. But they forget to mention that the
ore treated came from a surface dump and an open cut
not a dozen feet deep, and that no real mining was
required ! Yet treatment costs are low, and, if correct,
manager deserves credit for economy. As the gold won
was worth £570, and the costs work out at £lBO, there is
an apparent profit of £390. Royalty would add £llO to
tins ; total, £5OO. Co.’s South Gippsland leases returned
4740 z. from 284 tons, an average of 33dwt., the best for a
long time. Co.’s future is too uncertain to make scrip
anything but a gamble.
The lode found in Boulder Deep Levels is the
Great Boulder’s main lode, which trends through Boulder
Main Reef and Hannan’s Star, where it is known as
Morrison Lode. As the chutes dip south, this chute’s
origin may be found in Hannan’s Star or Main Reef.
Star’s deepest workings are at 675 ft., while Main Reef is
opened down to 1400 ft. Both co.’s are now looking
for the chute, and Main Reef has abandoned its lower
levels for its upper. This find should give a fillip to
mining generally, as it was made in a supposed wild cat.
* * * »
Paringa, Kalgoorlie, now in the B.M. stable,
is being thoroughly prospected from all three shafts
in the upper levels. Several small leaders have been met,
but only one, so far, holds out any prospects. At 52ft.
east of the main shaft a leader 12 to 18in. wide has been
opened up for a short distance, and assays have shown
from 2 to 18 oz. This is nothing much to boast of, but still
8., M. & Co.’s luck may prevail, and something good be
found. The Paringa is not on the trend of any known
line of lode, though it has lodes on all sides, and may pos-
sibly turn out trumps in the land of surprises. A crosscut
is being put in from the bottom level of the Paringa right
across the Brown Hill to prospect the ground in that
property. So far, the Brown Hill has proved a frost below
the famous rich chute, and it will be highly important to
the Brown Hill and other mines south if a fresh chute is
located. The Paringa’s shaft is 500 to 600 ft. deeper than
anything on the Brown Hill.

“ Friv.” : Touching your par. (8., 7/4/’O4)
re Jook of York’s boots : When a Melbourne
lady visited, in Hobson’s Bay, the warship which
carried the mighty atom, she begged to be shown
the royal bedroom. There, catching sight of the
soap with which his nibs had washed his hands,
she dropped on her knees and fervently kissed it,
exclaiming “Thank Heaven for that.” And she

Ambulance matters in one Australian city
are somewhat mixed. Some time ago the St.
George’s Society started a waggon for the
removal of injured persons to the hospi-
tal. This waggon, after many vicissi-
tudes, found accommodation at a city
stable. Then the owners of the stable
found out that St. George’s was paid in
many cases, and that the removal of
maimed and damaged people appeared
to be a profitable concern. They started
a competition, the St. David’s, and the
spectacle of the two ambulance carts
tearing up a small suburban street, the
drivers frantically whipping up their
steeds, after a dead ’un or an invalid
became common. The city now is waiting
for a St. Patrick’s cart to make its
appearance, and then, when a struggle
for a would-be suicide takes place among
the three, there will probably be witnessed
three carts making full speed for the
hospital with the patient in sections.
Meanwhile a Jew is fixing up a real, up-
to-date ambulance, which is to be called
St. Moses’.
Fremantle Methodists boast of a
dozen or so Chinese converts, who occupy
the front seats at services and are clad
in black suits, high, shining white collars,

The Anglican Bishop of Ballarat is very
cross with some young men and maidens who
lately figured at a fancy dress carnival in aid of a
local church club. There was nothing conspicu-
ously un-Christian about the carnival, considerin'?
that it realised a profit of £lOO for the good cause!
but the subsequent behavior of the masqueraders
has grieved the Bishop more than respectable
words can express. The frivolous young people
instead of attending divine service at the Cathedral
on next Sunday morning, grouped themselves in
tlieir fancy costumes outside the sacred building
and were photographed. Apart from the spiritual
danger they incurred by thus dolling themselves
up on the Lord s Day, the church clubbites seem
to have courted damnation by keeping themselves
and others outside the tabernacle during business
hours. No wonder the Bishop is “highly in-
censea.
OUR DEAR FAMILIAR PHILANTHROPIC UNCLE.
MAGISTRATE: "If you have means, why are you found roaming the streets in

Some bones and other reminiscences :
The hummocks on Garden Island (Sydney Harbor),
which are about to be levelled to provide an exercise-
ground for men-o’-warsmen, used to contain the bones of
two ancient Imperial officers, John Ovens and Ellis Bent,
nent. died in 1815 and was buried on the island ; Ovens
died in 1825, and requested to be buried in the same grave
as his friend, Bent. The bones were removed some years
ago to St. Thomas’ Cemetery, North Sydney, where they
now are. Sydney Evening News, in a recent article, said
that another notability was interred in the same grave on
the island—Oapt. Logan, Commandant at Moreton Bay
who was mysteriously murdered by the blacks while out
exploring, in 1830. The convicts were said to have incited
the blacks to slaughter the Commandant, he being noto-
riously a most cruel officer. Logan’s widow brought the
remains to Sydney and had them buried in the old Sand-
hills, she being' afraid that if interred in Brisbane the con
victs would desecrate the grave. The newspapers of the
day give an account of the burial, but no trace of Logan
f °: mdwh , e . n the tenants of the Sandhills were
eing shifted to La 1 erouse. The same with the remains
°L Ur ' Wardell, barrister, who was murdered four years
on his property at Petersham. In
the old Sandhills were two elaborate monuments covering
vaults, but without any indication as to the rude fore-
fathers who slept below. Logan was not buried on
Garden Island, but the aboriginal monarch, King Bun-
garee, was. The authorities, in shifting Bent and Ovens
took no stock m Bungaree, whose bones are still in the
hummock. His Majesty’s consort, Gooseberry, who died
of rum was buried in the Presbyterian burial-ground,
evonshire-street, a stone being placed over her remains
by publican Edward Bolton, who had given the Queen
shelter for some months prior to her death.
“The Prooshan” (after this the
subject drops into the deepest place going—
Gehenna or elsewhere): —
1 stiil maintain in spite of “One of ’Em "and other
scribes, that, on the whole, the country teacher is better
circumstanced than his town brother, who, with multi-
tudinous calls upon his purse, the strain of constant and
unremunerated coaching of pupil teachers, for whose
passes he is held immediately responsible, whether they
have brains or bran in their noddles, and the hacking he
gets on behalf of the public, is reduced to the level of that
drop of human sweat called the postmaster. But when
one reflects that many country teachers are malcontents
and hate their work simply because it is work, and not an
arm chair with punkahs and cigars laid on, argument is
useless. I happen to like my work and my community
and find, after 15 years’ experience, that communities are
pretty well what you make them.

N\S. W. Solicitor-General Pollock evidently
reckons that _Mr. Reid is coming back to State
politics. Reid defended and Pollock prosecuted
for the Crown in the Leichhardt tragedy case, and
Pollock went out of his way to speak of Reid’s
speech as “ the most eloquent that had ever been
heard m that historic court,” and further slimed
over the politician in terms of fulsome eulogy.
Mr. Pollock is an adaptable young man. He
made himself very handy to Mr. Jack Want when
that gentleman of the deceptive iron jaw was
Attorney - General. The legal profession mar-
velled at Mr. Pollock’s quick progress, but said
sagely “ Wait until there is a change of Govern-
ment.” There came a change and, 10, Mr. Pol-
lock was more handy to Mr. Wise than he had
even been to Mr. Want, and there was further
advancement. When the Friedman case threat-
ened the See Government, Pollock prepared to be
very polite to Carruthers—giving an interview
“agm” the Government to the D.T. Now
that Mr. Pollock licks Mr. Reid all over, it is an
indication that he again thinks something is about
to happen. There are slimes as well as straws
which show the direction of the wind.

“F.” writes from Melbourne :
A gory fight which recently transpired at Her Majesty’s
.Theatre, Ballarat, to the sinful delight of 1500 noble-art
patrons, and which was denounced as a horrible exhibition
by ex-Mayor Brokenshire of the Methodist Sunday School,
has called forth an interesting story from the other side.
A local sport states that he was among the doorkeeper s
at Her Majesty’s on one occasion long ago, when the
building was called the Academy of Music, and a revivalist
preacher was running a salvation season. The audiences,
says the reminiscent sport, behaved like an undisciplined
mob as compared with the orderly people who attend
prize fights. They rushed in and scrambled for places in
a disgraceful manner, and when “a well-known and
respectable citizen,” who had been a foremost pusher at
six successive meetings, was asked to give up his seat to a
country visitor, the pietist merely squared his elbows,
turned up the whites of his eyes, and replied : “ I have
my own soul to save.” ! The Christian influence of hot-
gospelling is strikingly evidenced in this story. From the
speaker’s point of view the preacher was dispensing salva-
tion to as many souls as could squeeze into the show, and
the duty of every true believer was to wolf all the salva-
tion he could g'et both hands on. If he took twice as
much as he really required, and left none at all for some-
body else, that was somebody else’s lookout. The picture
of a man who is saved twice as much as he really needs
trying to carry two tons of superfluous piety up to the
gate, and break ng his back lialf-way, has many possi-
bilities for an artist.

“W.S.T.” : One of the most skilful and
daring of American burglars was recently dumped
down in Sydney from a Californian mailboat. He
was brought before a ’Frisco court about six weeks
back, and given 24 hours to get out of the country.
He was shepherded on board the liner, too, to
insure that Australia should get the benefit of him.
Some of the Australian States have the same free-
and-easy method of getting rid of their criminals,
and, as N.S.W. has no Influx of Criminals Pre-
vention Act, the exported crooks remain loose in
N.S.W. until they commit some crime, and then
sometimes they manage to keep loose. The new
Federal Minister for Home Affairs should look
to it.
THE WINTER GIRL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Her name is Lily. She is fair,
With soft blue eyes and flaxen hair,
And breath as Sweet as spices.
Her cheek is round, and soft, and white.
I do not like my darling quite
So fair in Winter, nor delight
In hints of Arctic ices.
So she has warmed with chemist’s gold
The silken net which, fold on fold,
Enframes her face completely ;
And with a magic touch she grows
In each cheek’s Puritanic snows
One fragrant rose of red that glows
With summer ardor sweetly.
Her brows are darker than they were,
Her lips are redder, and I swear
Her tenderest caresses
Are tipped with painless flame that seeks
Heart hidden raptures. Folly speaks
Who says to paint my Lily’s cheeks
Ridiculous excess is !
E.D.
TO DIANA—AND ANOTHER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I kiss your hand 1 I hardly dare ;
So calm your pose, so cold your air.
With form and face an artist’s dream—
But cold as ice, without its gleam—
You stand, all unresponsive, there.
Divine, but hardly debonnair ;
Above all love or lover’s care ;
Of frig-id excellence the cream,
I kiss your hand.
I kiss your hand, my shy love, fair ;
I kiss your lips, your eyes, your hair.
Warm, tender, made for love, you seem,
And that’s the better part, I deem.
Though Dian be a jewel rare,
I kiss your hand.

THE
BEST
WORLD
IN
THE
GENERAL VIEW OF THE NEW SYLLABUS IN N.S.W. SCHOOLS.
The Salvarmy—the most stupendous
cadge concern in the universe has made
another begging move by erecting a “Samaritan
Hospital” (to cost £lO,OOO, without the internal
furnishings) at Punt-road, Richmond (Vic.). The
utter callousness of Salvarmy methods as com-
pared with the admirable secular charitable
institutions of all kinds already in existence,
which are half-starving on account of the bad
times, should warn the public off subscribing.
One purpose that the new hospital is intended to
fulfil is to train a legion of nurses who will toil for
nothing save a crust, uniform, and the glory of Booth
and Co., to compete against the army of women
who have taken up nursing as a means of liveli-
hood. These gratis nurses will, of course, be
missionaries of Booth, and will haunt the sick bed
to breathe big drum into the sufferer’s ear, and
bid him leap in the gutter of the spirit seeing that
the flesh is laid up. The ideal Booth world begins
to loom ahead. Every kind of industry will be
run by wild-eyed unpaid persons in uniform, and the
proceeds of the sale of the goods -will go to Booth.
Everybody, instead of getting a fixed wage, will
pass the hat, and will keep such of the proceeds as
Booth doesn’t want for himself. The world will
be one vast cadge and hallelujah, and the hat will
be 18ft. deep and 3yds. across. The whole unpaid
population will jump in the gutters in the even-
ings, and everything will belong to Booth, whose
fortune will be £743,000,000,000,000,000, 000. The
Booth mystery is, after all, very simple.
Formerly you paid Mrs. Jones ss. to do your
washing. Now you pay Booth 45., and he allows
Mrs. Jones, who has been “saved,” Is. 6d. and a
hallelujah out of it. The law will yet have to
come down heavily on the holy and corybantie
Pa Delohery, of Potts Point and of the
N.S.W. Public Service Board, has triumphed
in his case of “ ancient lights.” For 20 years has
the light of day streamed through the windows of
the Delohery villa, and, basing his claim on an
Act passed in George I.’s reign, Pa Delohery
grabs that light as his own—his light-of-way, so
to speak. So when a co. started to build next
door and promised to block up some of his
windows, the head of the family protested. But
the co. went on, so Pa Delohery, with a barrister
son on his right and a solicitor son on his left,
demanded redress from the law. He was refused
an injunction, and the case dragged on from
court to court until the co. had finished the
building. Now the High Court has restored to
Pa Delohery his ancient lights, holding that
George I.’s Act applies to the Commonwealth.
So a good action for damages now appears to lie
against the co., unless the ramifications of the law
hit the Delohery family in some unexpected way.

South Australia has had a sorrowful in-
stance of the failure of a scientist when put to do
administrative work. A couple of years ago it
imported an American agriculturist, Professor
Towar, to help the farmers along, and he was doing
all right till he was run in to manage the Agricul-
tural College at Poseworthy. Then the dreamy
person just let things slide, the youngsters got out
of hand, and chaos came with great promptness.
The Government appointed a commission to in-
quire into the ructions ; the professor, who was a
deeply religious and Quakerish soul in a broad-
brimmed hat, made no defence, remarking that it
was against his principles to fight; and, as the
result of about the most ’stinging report ever
written in South Australia, he resigned, and
quietly moved back to America without making
so much as a single kick.

The N.S.W. United Furniture Trades
Union has decided to remonstrate with the
Government on the question of goal labor. It
says that “the amount of furniture made in the
gaols for Government offices constitutes a serious
and unfair rivalry with the workmen engaged in
the trade outside the gaol.” This is the sort of
thing that always happens. When a State gets
tired of paying from £5O to £lOO a year for the
maintenance in idleness of a prisoner who is sup-
posed to be at hard labor, and sets him earning
his own living for a change, somebody calls round
and complains of the ‘ ‘ unfair competition ” of the
goal industry. Prisoners have to be kept; and
the whole question is whether they shall be com-
pelled to keep themselves or whether the more or
less honest people outside shall be taxed to keep
them. Evidently the furniture makers reckon
that the prisoners should have a good long loaf at
the expense of the public. In that case Heaven
only knows why we should go to the trouble of
running them in at al 7 .
The S.M. Herald continues to pipe like a
flustered old dame who has told a drawing-room
what a fearful thing it is that Mrs. Jones has
run away to America with the bank teller, and
that she deeply regrets that Mrs. Brown has gone
to the mountains with Mr. Jones, whereupon
Mrs, Jones and Mrs. Brown come out of the
shadow of the palm where they have been drink-
ing their tea, and tell the old dame that it’s a
beautiful afternoon. The S.M. Herald has told
awful yarns of the things that would happen
if the Federal Labor party ever got a chance to
hold office, and now that it has got a chance and
none of the terrible things has happened, the
old soul pipes—-“ Yes, Mrs. Jones hasn’t run away
yet, just to spite me; but, mark my words, she
will. Also mark my words if Mrs. Brown doesn’t
go away with Mr. Jones soon.” Even an afternoon-
tea party would have sense enough to see that
evidently the old lady wasn’t an authority on the
Brown and Jones family affairs ; but quite several
people still take the old lady Herald seriously.

THE PROOF OF THE PUDDING.
“I hear your famous chef has left you suddenly.
How hard on your wife after all the trouble
she had to get him.”
“ Well, perhaps—but she’s gone with him.”
Melbourne thieves have disgusted Chief
Commissioner of Railways Tait with their impu-
dence. It is found that they have been in the
habit of hiding stolen property by the simple
device of leaving it in the luggage room at Spencer-
street till called- for. The fact that the Depart-
ment has been acting as a receiver was given away
by a nervous purloiner last week, and now there
is a policeman stowed under the counter, awaiting
applicants for parcels reasonably presumed to have
been stolen. Which recalls the fact that a few
vears ago a thief who got away from a Melbourne
pawnbrokery with a bunch of watches wrapped up
in a pair of moleskin trousers (he did up his swag-
while Moses Aaron was testing some alleged gold),
being hard pressed, carefully lost his bundle m the
General P. 0., and repurchased it at the next sale
of unclaimed property. He confessed his wicked-
ness to the “ d.'s” on being taken for another
little affair with a, stolen watch in every pocket
and two more down his back.

A scene, which looked like an extract from
a Bland Holt melodrama, was staged at Bendigo
police court last week. Mrs. Bessie Pickett,
suing her husband for means of support, stated
that she had buried a previous husband, Patrick
Francis O’Bryan, at the time when Melbourne was
erecting triumphal, arches in honor of the little
Dookoyork. An accident, she said, occurred m
the building of an arch, whereby Patrick afore-
said became a mangled corpse, and she, the horror-
stricken widow, identified his remains at the
morgue, previous to planting them in the cowrd
ground. In June last year she led James Pickett
t > a matrimonial agency, and he called h°r wife
until Easter week, when he confronted her with a
man who claims to be the original O’Bryan, She
denied all knowledge of this person, whereas
Pickett took him for granted and cleared out of
the complication. Hence, the lady’s suit against
Pickett, the only husband whom she accepts as
an actual living fact. The Bench having
heard Mrs. P.’s evidence, called for the. alleged
O’Bryan. The man from the grave cheerfully
proclaimed himself the missing husband, and Mrs.
Pickett positively stated that he wasn’t. Matters
were further complicated by Mrs. P.’s lawyer.
He wanted a warrant for wife desertion against
the man whom Mrs. Pickett wouldn’t identify as
her husband. Then the lawyer for husband
Pickett demanded a bigamy warrant against the
woman, and the Bench depided to give things time
to adjust themselves. Mrs. Pickett left the court
with her relatives, who mostly told her she was
Mrs. O’Bryan sure enough. The police at latest
dates had satisfied themselves that no person
O’Bryan or otherwise —met with a fatal accident
during the erection of any Dookoyork arch. The
question whether Mrs. O’Bryan buried the wxong
man, or the right man, or merely dreamed an
accident which never came to pass, has probably
been settled ere now to the satisfaction of every-
body concerned.

Alfred Russell, who shot a Sydney suburban
builder who, so he thought, had swindled him over
a time-payment transaction, has been acquitted
of a charge of murder on the grounds of insanity.
The Bulletin is not a bloodthirsty paper, but it
would cordially welcome an epidemic of shooting
at and, say, nearly killing, swindling solicitors,
land agents, company promoters, and so on. Aus-
tralian law gives but very slight protection to the
victims of such people ; if the victims made some
law of their own on the subject it would act at
once as a deterrent, and as a stimulant to legisla-
tive reform in the matter. Russell may have been
entirely wrong in his notions about the unfortunate
man whom he killed, but there’s not the least
doubt that many a suburban builder will now
take counsel with himself as to whether it would
not be better to play a bit fairer in the future.
Russell, unfortunately, didn’t shoot a solicitor,
and a wholesome lesson to the legal profession was
thus lost.

The establishment of the Federation Club,
the headquarters of the Victorian employers, is
another nail driven in the Melbourne publican’s
coffin. Comfortable room 3, with two large
billiard-tables and a well-stocked bar, are
great inducements to hold frequent meet-
ings of violent protest against “ Social-
ism.” The Federation Club is a
very comfortable boozing den.
Politically, the club is a huge
farce, but the whisky is Al.

Two Victorian municipal
councils, Sale and Castlemaine,
are just now at loggerheads with
their medical officers. Each place
possesses what it is pleased to
call “ornamental lakes,” the
ornaments chiefly consisting of
mud and drowned goats and the
remains of Old Dog Tray. The
local doctors have taken to
making insulting reports about
these things. The Sale officer
straightly charged the councillors
with encouraging fevers and
other “dirt ” epidemics, while
the Castlemaine man told
his employers that if their
dirty - smelling water-
holes were on private
property they would
not be tolerated for
a moment. And
of course, instead
of cleaning out
their cess-
pools, both
sets of
councillors
said the
medieof
should
speak more
respectfully of
their bosses, and
not disparage local
institutions. It seems
probable that the serpent in Eden was really
the original councillor, and all the trouble
arose through him making a tip of the choicest
flower-beds.

The inquiry into the military row between
Neild of the fearsome moustache, and Hutton of
the powerful language and the code telegram, is
already complicated by the fact that one document
is missing, and another has been “tampered
with.” This reads like the beginning of a Drey-
fus mystery in Australia. Doubtless there will be
a row about forged documents later on, and
strange conspirators will meet Hutton at street
corners and give him letters, and there will be a
long series of inquiries and ramifications, and in
the end Neild will be wrongfully sentenced to do
seven years on Eriday Island or will be exiled to
the extreme end of Wilson’s Promentory without
any bear’s grease for his moustache. Neild as a
lonesome figure pining in a striking attitude on
the top of the Promontory whenever a ship went
bv would be most interesting.

Governor Le Ilunte put the Adelaide
National Memorial Committee in a hole by invit-
ing Bishop Harmer and Archbishop O’Reily to
join his party at the unveiling of the monument,
although his private secretary had been informed
that no beads of religious denominations were
being asked to the ceremony. Gards were hur-
riedly sent to all the other representative parsons
in order to prevent bloodshed and the upsetting
of hats and gaiters in the gutter. There was
trouble, too, over the statue of M'Douall Stuart,
the explorer, the soured Jenkins and his colleagues
refusing to attend because Kingston’s law-partner,
M‘Lachlan, did the unveiling. Jenkins is angry

Sydney developed something considerable
in the way of a sordid mystery last week. A
young man and woman were found dead in one
of the ancient houses of Castlereagh-street on
Friday night; they had been dead for a day, but
it was the sort of house where strange things may
happen without anybody getting hurriedly in-
quisitive about them. The young man had a revolver
in his hand which seemed to have been placed
there loosely ; also there was a note addressed to
the world at large in the woman’s writing
intimating that she was going to shoot the
man and then herself. Even the afternoon
paper reporter wasn’t able to see any dark
and awful mystery about the business, until
the police doctor (who has made a study , of
the different ways in which you can kill your-
self and other people) swore that, if the woman
did the shooting, she must almost have tied her-
self into a knot to do it; and as there wasn’t any
indication of that, he believed that, if the man
didn’t do all the shooting, then some third party
did it; and if there was a third party m the case,
then the mystery presented a deeper mystery than
ever. It was too tangled for a coroner’s jury to
settle off-hand ; so it was hung up for a week,
apparently in the hope that meanimne it might
untangle itself.
IN VAIN.
COOKY: “Rode over to church to-day, and 'ad all
my trouble fer nothin'."
WIFE : “Didn't parson turn up?"
COCKY : “ Oh, he turned up all right, but a man
I arranged to meet there didn’t.”
The extreme casualness of Maoriland !
On. the night of May 21st at Wellington (M.L.),
a seaman arrived with a cargo of beer and
a loaded revolver at the house of his wife,
from whom he had for over a year been sepa-
rated. There was another person there, in the
usual happensome fashion, and a fight ensued.
During the struggle the revolver was discharged
twice, and one shot struck the lodger. A neighbor
wandered in and urged the men to stop, and they
stopped. When the wife arrived on the scene the
two men were seated in the room where the fight
took place, arguing the matter out. Then the
wounded person wandered out, and shortly after-
wards the husband went away to his boarding
house. The wounded man happened along to a
police station, and remarked that someone had
fired at him. The police displayed ho great in-
terest, and just went on happening, and the com-
plainant dawdled along the street, having a few
drinks on the way, and arrived at another police
station. There he also hazarded the observation
that he had been made a target of, but omitted to
say whether he had been hit, and the police didn’t
happen to ask. Feeling that his news was rather
uninteresting and the pubs being closed, he went
home again about this time, and remarked that he
felt unwell. He went to bed, and it occurred to
somebody to send for a doctor, with the result that
the drifter was removed to the hospital, where, -
next day, he happened to die. The husband, is
under arrest on a charge of murder, but it will
probably be set up as a defence that the direct
cause of death was the way the lodger floated
about the street, making imperfect explanations to
policemen, publicans, dust-bins and the like.
Apart from the original shooting it was all in-
ust a series of happens.

Most people had either forgotten all about
the Melbourne Queen’s Memorial Statue, or thought
the blessed thing was erected somewhere long ago,,
but now it seems it isn’t started yet. After much
toil and frequent passing of the plate some £6OOO
was got together—in place of the £50,000 expected
when Syme started the “ loyal outburst ” —but that .
only allows for a granite and stucco pedestal and
some very plain steps at bottom. Now, the cona-
mittee wants a pedestal of white marble, three,
courses of steps, also four blocks, each carrying an
imitation lion (at least, bronze lions in imitation
of those in Trafalgar Square). The beasties are
expected to cost £250 each, and the other embel-
lishments will call for an additional £O5O. The
committee is now asking good citizens who want
to glue their advertisement on the dead Queen’s
gravestone, in a manner of speaking, fo ante up
the coin.
THE STUDENT AND THE MAID.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
f met her by the clearing on the track,
Her eyes were full of mischief looking back ;
She was tall and straight and slender,
And her mouth was red and tender—
4nd I do a lot of walking up the track.
There’s a pretty sheltered corner by a hedge,
With ferns that cluster on a rocky ledge ;
And one morn while strolling there
I’d a glimpse of maiden hair
'Neath a vastly pretty bonnet, by the hedge.
So I alternate between these spots each day,
In the hope that luck will send a maid my way ;
Hang my law exams, and duty,
Let me rather watch for Beauty,
With her eyes more full of mischief every day !

THE VARNISHED BOARD
A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, June 7, 1904.
My Dear Arini
I break my bones to you. I make you a double
bow. The past week has been honorably lively.
From this you may guess that “ The Darling of the
Gods” has trivially bitten me. Those Heaven-borns,
the Rawsons, and their highly-scented staff, and cer-
tain lotus-flower girls deigned to enter the play-
house, thereby extracting from the honorable
audience a thousand welcomes, as the night air
distils the perfume from the moon flowers. The
exceeding courtesy of the Togos and Itos and Yo
Sans affected me so strongly that when I had to
arise at midnight to admit our “Tweeny,” I
found myself saying “ I must beg you to graciously
accept an unworthy discharge.”
To come back to the usual George-street speech.
One stone the more swung to its place when Lady
Northcote laid the foundation rock of the Child-
ren’s Hospital. The site is fairly close to the
Sydney University (and therefore to the medical
school), on what was Mr. J. Lucas’ property. A
prosperous-looking crowd, marked by silken rustle
and gleaming top-hat and sheen of furs, assembled
by invitation to watch the very ordinary cube of
grey granite (never a frill round its neck nor
a bit of ribbon on its tail) set down on the
mortar and dabbled by her Ex. with an ivory and
silver mallet. She no more laid the stone than I
did. A crane swung it into position. What I
would like to see would be Lady Northcote, and
Lady Rawson, and the latter’s daughter, and Miss
Eadith Walker, and Mrs. Wise, and Mrs. Walter
Hall, and Mrs. John Hay, and as many more of
Sydney society as could clutch a handful of the
granite, with streams of toil running down their
faces, personally hoist the stone on to its
mortar. That would be a genuine laying. Mr.
Francis Suttor made a speech into a Moreton
Bay fig-tree, whose branches were loaded with
ragged small boys, and mentioned that £14,000
had been received in cash and promises, but that
£34,000 would be necessary for construction.
Queen Alexandra sent her cheque for 10 guineas,
and the donations included £lOOO from Mr. and
Mrs. Walter Hall, and £5OOO from Mr. Todman.
• The amount actually laid on the stone was
£4,500. A little boy, Reggie Paxton, was pre-
sented to the Northcote and Rawson ladies as the
collector of a sum of £215 within a year. The
youngster has an ideal face for a saintly chorister.
He took up the collecting fad on his own initiative,
and used to go to factories and shops on pay days.
A pair of big grey eyes, with quarter yard black
lashes, must have stood him in good stead—but
what about the truant officer ? Reggie must have
played the wag pretty often.
The C. I. lady’s gown was of heliotrope cloth with
yak lace, and her hat—the back of it flattened well
down over her hair—was trimmed with great sprays
of wistaria and yellow acacia flowers, and had dia-
mond ornaments on the front of the drooping brim.
Lady Rawson faced the brilliant sunshine in a
light gray tweed, a black velvet coat and a
Russian squirrel toque with violets. The Misses
Ruby and Lily See were present with their father.
The former, who are of course in mourning, were
beautifully furred. Miss Eadith Walker carried
arctic foxes—snowy-white, very soft furs. Premier
John See looks a good advertisement for Rotorua,
where he has been for some time. He is thinner,
of a healthy mahogany hue, and looks not afraid
of coalitions, crises, elections, or any other like
indigestible roots.
Our recent visitor, Bulkeley-Johnston, is tour-
ing M.L. 8.-J. has done the Wanganui River,
Taupo, and Rotorua. He is running over the
place in the interests of the Northcotes, who
intend to tour M.L. before the end of the year.
In fact, he is, so to speak, the dog on whom M.L.
is being tried. Girl clerks in the various offices
which 8.-J. had to visit were' quite unable to
thump the typewriters for some hours after sight
of him. His Goliath person and flamingo com-
plexion are not everyday items.
Upon an afternoon lately I chanced to see the
State Governor’s carriage toiling into town up
those steep hills from “Cranbrook.” It was
taking Lady Rawson to open some old mission
show. At night pretty well all the “ Cranbrook ”
vehicles did the same cruel ups and downs on their
way to a charity ball, and the horses looked just
as exhausted as the poor “Cranbrook” lady. A
Sb can be too stiddy. And a State Government
ouse may be too far from town. The man,
or men, who planted the stiddy-job Governor down
at the back of the beyond, when that Macquarie-
street place was available, must have had, not one
rat, but a whole nest. The Governor-General is
with us, on an average, about one month out of
the 12, yet it costs us many thousands a year to
keep up Federal Government House. Why, in
the name of a spook, shouldn’t the State Governor
inhabit the place, and when a Gov.-Gen. and con-
sort arrive they could have a nice balcony-room in
the same humpy. Or a pavilion might be erected
in the grounds for them. But I fancy a com-
fortable, balcony room, fully furnished, would
suit a respectable married couple like the North-
cotes.
A while ago the Government offered Governor
Rawson a motor car, but he declined it on the
score that the finances of the country did not per-
mit of the expense. If the Government only saw
those jaded brumbies carrying their overworked
owners to their jobs sometimes three times a day,
the sight would make the Government sob, and it
would force the motor car on Cranbrook for the
sake of the horses, or else, for the sake of the
humans, shift the household to Macquarie-street.
Some women have the fortune-teller “ rat” very
badly. A woman whom no one credits with any
literary ability has for three months been going to
fortune-tellers—from the sixpenny ones up to the
five shillingers—to find out if she will take the
£lOO prize that the S.M.H. is offering for a story.
She has only just begun the story, but to quote
herself “she wanted cumulative evidence that
her’s would be the prize tale before she would
tackle the drudgery of writing it.” According to
the Sydney witches she will win.
A lady—she looked the genuine thing—rode
cavalier fashion on horseback through a part of
Sydney last week, and excited considerable atten-
tion Her divided skirts fell over either leg as far
as the neat foot, and if she and the horse had no
objection to the innovation no one else could hint
at any.
Miss Aileen Ward, only daughter of J. G.
Ward of r M.L., has won a prize of nine guineas
in a competitive examination organised by the
London Trinity College of Music.
I noticed a few pretty conceits in the dressing
at Her Majesty’s on the opening night of what
Laun at the Lyceum has called “ The Snarling of
the Dogs. ” One was a lace butterfly, large lif e-size,
poised on top of a girl’s rolled-back hair. Two
wings lay flat and two were erect. Mrs. L.
Beaton wore a wreath of Virginia creeper,
autumn tints, and someone near her had a spray
of white maiden-hair along the top of her roll.
Juliet caps are becoming general enough, but as a
rule the cap is not properly made or the face
below it is not the kind of face that goes with that
land of cap.
Miss Edna Hayward, a daughter of the captain
of the Sonoma, is engaged to be married to one
Butler, of San Francisco—“son of a millionaire,”
says the announcement. The Hayward girls were
here during the Crossley visit, and seemed very
chummy with the contralto.
Sydney is full of half backs, three-quarter
backs and full backs. The Te Aute (Maori)
footballers are stopping at Manly, where their
behavior is as decorous as a flock of curates. The
sonorous saying of their grace before and after
meals is a quite musicianly circumstance.
Very few other-Staters came over to our A.J.C.
Birthday races, and even this State sent only a
Omall contingent. _ A chroniclesome figure was the
Lady Northcote, in her putty-white, oyster-white,
or cream cloth gown. You may take your choice
of shades. I heard it called all three. Her
cloak, of the same tone, had a mauve and yellow
flower design painted on the collar and cuffs.
Lady Rawson wrapped herself in a black velvet
coat and fufs, and the Girl looked very well in a
navy-blue frock and a “ clever ” hat. Mrs. Bland
Holt, with a sac coat of Russian squirrel over her
brown velvet skirt, and with turquoises in her ears,
helped to brighten the meeting. Among her escort
was Mr. Ernest Tyson, who, by the way, has just
Gold his motor car to Mr. Jack Want, and now the
Want girls are busy learning the ways of the
demon in the car. I’m told that you’ve got to
feed the brute so largely that he comes expensive.
Mrs. Monty Severn, who owns an infantile com-
plexion, showed up under a big white felt hat with
ostrich plumes, and inside a cardinal red gown
with white facings. She had a considerable naval
escort, but as it was in mufti it looked quite like
any other Reginald Percy.
On the public holiday, Monday, the racecourse
was of a degree of liveliness that gave it the aspect
of being the burial-day of a person of no import-
ance instead of the birthday of the P. of W. Two
imported beauties varied the monotony of the
faces that are always with us. One, Maud
Jeffries, wearing a longer-than-herself pale blue
cloth coat over her brown dress looked out .tired
and pasty from under a cigar-colored hat. An.
other was Florence Hamer, the brunette who is
seized with such attractive hysterics every night
at the Criterion. She had the biggest brown eyes
of the meeting, and with her arctic fox furs and
the huge turquoise studs in her ears, her grey
gown and light-blue hairy toque, she certainly
didn’t make sorrier this sorry scheme of things.
Mrs. Ph’lip Morton, who had a moleskin coat,
suggested a figure seen through smoked glass.
She was smokily-dressed all over, and if it were
not for her face and the mass of * superb orchids
at her breast, you’d say she ought to be
curling .up through the chimney. A slight revival
of the tailor-made gown was apparent. Mrs. Col-
man Burke’s navy-blue tight-fitter was strapped
with blue velvet, and the radiant, green bird in
front of her black panne hat must have got out of
Yo-San’s garden-aviary. There was one baby-
lamb coat present—Miss Caro inside it. Read
somewhere lately that, in New York, girl bridge-
maniacs in poor circumstances strive to win enough
to buy themselves a jacket of infant lambskin.
Miss Lalla Walshe, of Randwick, is the winner
of Mrs. J. C. Williamson’s prize in the historical
head-dress guessing competition in connection
with the Consumptive Homes ball last week.
Mrs. Burton Dibbs, one of the hon. secs, for the
function, issued 1500 ballot papers, but only 15
guessers responded. None was entirely successful.
And no wonder. One lady’s head, for instance,
represented “ Charles the Second’s sister.” If she
had carried Charles the First’s head, labelled
“ Pa,” in her arms the guessers would have had a
clue. Both vice-regal families came along wearing
their longest tails, and it was a brilliant and well-
organised function.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent
“Much truth in that ‘Gaiety’ verse which
apostrophises, ‘ You men, simple men ! ’ A meek
bonnet is quite enough to hoodwink a man as to the
any thing-but-meek woman who wears it. A sweetly -
pretty barmaid, travelling by sea t’other day,
chose to dress as a nurse. The captain knew quite
well that the lady’s likeness to a ministering-angel
began and ended with her dovelike vesture.
Nevertheless, when a motherless baby was brought
aboard and he had to decide whose cabin-mate it
should be, he delightedly handed it over to
‘Nursie,’ as ‘Flossie’ chose to call herself for the
time being. Next morning the parrakeet in
pigeon’s plumage was shrilly threatening to throw
the imp overboard, aud, as soon as the skipper
appeared, he received a formal complaint of the
squaller’s conduct. All the other women were
desperately seasick, and the stewardess was too busy
to take the responsibility of an urchin just old
enough to crawl into mischief. Then an undemon-
strative girl submitted to the infant’s company.
She kept it fenced into the foot of her berth as she
lay in misery, and continually passed it news-
papers to tear up. And they both got to port
alive.
“ Victoria’s Talbot goes golfing o’spare after-
noons. Aide Buchanan, whose job is, after all,
mostly a caddy one, doesn’t carry the sticks for
golf. He rings up the other kind of caddy before-
hand, so that by the time Gov. Reggie and his
junior staff mote to Caulfield, the links are cleared
for a Talbot drive. Caulfield is not the Victorian
most-particular club, but the handiest. All the
same, the Sandringham crowd can’t see that the
trip to their tony links offers insuperable difficul-
ties, with the motor in the Stonington stable.
This club adjusts its eye-glass and is cross over
the matter —devilish cross.
Melbourne has a nice, old solicitor up in the
Chancery Lane quarters whose particular line of
business brings him into association with green
young things ; or perhaps they are oftener young
than verdant. After the negotiations have been
concluded, His Nibs gently murmurs that he is
going to ask a favor, and before the client has had
time to revolve this thoroughly in her mind, he
sweetly asks might he kiss her on the cheek—‘ just
in a fatherly way ’ ? As a rule, the youthful thing
hereabouts isn’t taking any such fatherly ways,
and says so bluntly. He doesn’t add his blighted
hopes to the bill. The ageing Lothario intimates
that he isn’t hurt, that he bears no ill-will, and
that she must forget his foolishness. He’s a useful,
obliging old fellow, so the maiden shrugs her
shoulders and forgives easily.
’‘Tourists tell of pale face being in vogue in
Europe. Paris taboos the bourgeois rosy cheek ;
but lip-salve is permitted more than ever. Tiny
sticks of the salve are slid into a side pocket of the
purse. With much black dressing, pallid faces
strike one as far more wicked than the gaudy
scheme of complexion.
“ State Governor Reggie and two aides in
full Reggiementals went to Geelong, the other
day, to unveil a statue to Queen \ ictoria. After
dinner the Governor got to work, but the veil
refused to unveil when Gov. Reggie pulled the
string. Then somebody ran (at Geelong pace)
into a backyard for a clothes-prop, and after some
eight minutes’ tugging and prodding the veil came
off. Even unveiling is a slow matter at Geelong.
“ That poor little Jewess who, having mysteri-
ously disappeared three months ago, was found
drowned t’other day near St. Kilda baths, was as
bright and energetic a girl as one was likely to
meet. As a schoolgirl in Sydney she interviewed
Kipling when he visited that city, and he
was a good deal impressed by the literary and
oratorical promise of the vivacious Miss. Gifted
with a pleasant voice and a good memory, Miss
Ackman took it into her sanguine young head
that she was destined to become an orator.
She might have done so, had manner without
matter sufficed, but when after much preliminary
excitement, she gave her first lecture in Mel-
bourne, the general verdict was that deeper ac-
quaintance with her subject would be desirable
before undertaking a second oration. At her age,
this should not have been a crushing blow, but, no
doubt, the would-be lecturess found it a de-
pressingly hard task to fan up support and
encouragement for a second attempt. At all
events, she did not orate in public again, though
that first try took place some years ago. She was
only twenty-eight when she died. If (as her
friends seem inclined to believe) her death was due
to disappointment, surely her despair was as pre-
mature as her early hopes of success.
“All the household effects that made Mr. Peter
Tyson’s Bolac Station one of the show plaoes of
the Western District passed under the hammer
last week. Crowds hustled to the sacrifice. Some
exquisite Satsuma ware went for a little more than
the cost of a gramophone selection. House-
holders gathered for far less than half their
original price cabinet treasures and ornate bric-a-
brac that took the owner years of travel, good
judgment and a long purse to capture in gorgeous,
smellful Asia. Bolac Station changed hands
recently when the Tyson estate was marketed.
“The pushful wife of one Federal ex-Minister is
so annoyed at her big man being out of office that
she has acquired the use of that efficient word,
‘ Rats ! ’ and turns it on to every inconsiderate
gossip who touches on the subject of politics. She
is irate and shuts up the bothering people who will
start the hateful subject with plain, blunt ‘ Rats!’
Now ‘ Rats ’ requires to be said with a winking
accompaniment, or a negative but a good-tem-
pered shrug, or, at the least, a comic grimace.
But the Federal dame says it with palpable ill-
temper, and it becomes a vicious snap. Why
show such anger? It only makes the enjoyment of
the other cat the greater.
“ The ordinary bazaar siren is seldom thanked.
She is reckoned to have sufficiently profited by
her pleasure, her ‘ mashing ’ excitements, and her
notoriety, to square the gratitude account. But
the Rev. Robinson entertained 80 of his fair
fleecers at a theatre-party to the ‘ Three Little
Maids’ last week. Of course though, the Rev. R.
is running a sweep, too, and the £2O or so spent
meant a good advt.
“The matrons of Melbourne are circulating
cards for a fancy hop to break into the grey
melancholy of July. Bachelors are chiefly exer-
cised in evolving a cute character-dress. One poli-
tician from the West ponders whether he dare
work a point for his pet play-ground and appear
in the head-dress and feathers of a Papuan chief.
He will submit the notion to the Dress Censor
Committee next week.
“A riotous splendor of petticoat is one of the
strong attractions of ‘ The Girl from Kay’s.’ To
such extent is the under-silk swirling carried on
that Miss Madge Crichton (The Girl) gets away
from the rainbow flare of the background dazzlers
in cerise, mauve, turquoise, and buttercup, with
sub-layers of most respectable chocolate. The
Girl, too, is putting in a week-end giddily with
the Hoggenheimer, whose pet-name is ‘ Piggie,’
and the subdued brown petticoat doesn’t
harmonise with such loose scarlet behavior.
Miss Maud Hobson has some fine dress effects.
One is a faint poetic grey, flowering into beautiful
scrolly lines, and owning a Moonlight-on-the-
Danube effect in the glitter of its sequins. A
flight of snowy plumes comes down the left slope
of a haughty hat —the other slope is given over
to a group of lace frills aud millinery gems.
The packed house that jammed the Princess to
see the ‘ Girl ’ was prinked out to the uttermost
degree. Mrs. Ernest Brooke among the stall
sparklers, Miss Landale in one of the detached
pens, and Mrs. Jack Fisher in the circle,
accumulated most dress points. A French model
creation in a pale pink carnation m inner, with
no end of real lace spreading to starboard,
sported by Mrs. J. C. William ,o i, from Sydney-
side, scored heavily.
The hall-porters at Menzies’ were driven to
desperation at the time of Julius Knight’s bron-
chial attack. Hundreds of feminines were inquir-
ing personally or per tube for the Knight thorax
from dawn to misty eve. A lorry-load of cards
were left for him. Being a beauty actor is a great
game—only rivalled in its opportunities of
peacocking before women by being a baboon who
can smoke a cigar and drink wine out of a glass.
“ The Victorian Agent-General, his dame and
niece are quartered in the neighborhood of Queen’s
Club Gardens, Kensington. This will suit Mrs.
Taverner sweetly. The stout, good-natured dame
has a short neck, but a tall ambition. She is one
of those whose bustling, jolly manner indicates a
simplicity of nature which they have not. The
deep purpose and the remote aim are in safe reser-
vation all the time. The astute woman who can
talk breezily of nothing and laugh a lot is
whole fathoms deeper than the one with close lips
and inscrutable eyes. An ex-Minister’s wife on
the Victorian side of the Federal domain was one
of the former. She made so much noise, chatted
so incessantly, wore so much smile that few to
this day guess her backstairs influence, her weight
with a Gr.-Gr. like Hopetoun, and her power in
several high quarters.
“ The insolvency of brewer John M ‘Gee broke
upon the Brighton folk as a sudden shock. The
cold, grey brewer scheduled to the extent of over
£51,465. The tall-necked doctor son, whose high
crop of hair has bristled haughtily ever since he
physicked Earl Beauchamp (when in Melbourne),
is set down as one of his Dad’s creditors. The
only daughter of the family—Miss Faerie M‘Gee
—is classed as a society beauty. She is tall,
copper-haired, piquant but subdued in manner.
“On State polling day Mrs. Donald Maclrinnon
passed through town in a slap-dash hop-sac, a
snug toque, and her saucy nose in the air. The
large, effective dame showed less interest in the
elections than the wife of the hard-fighting candi-
date generally does, but her friends knew that she
cared much and had a lot of real anxiety stowed
away somewhere. Mrs. Donald Mac. stands out
from all the other swagger Mackinnon dames as
the owner of all the looks. The clan of Argus
fame are noted for a lot of frill and a dearth of
attractiveness. And their airs are intolerable.
Handsome Mr.s. Donald is sporty and her rather
retrousse nose is friendly and humorous.
“ The Misses Landale are the only dazzlers who
get effect out of a wintry drive. They strike
russet-red or leaf-brown tones, perhaps even warm
freys, and sit among brown cushions, supporting
rown parasols that are like a fluttersome roof of
quivering brown leaves. They might be a couple
of gay woodland blossoms in an autumn setting.
“ A Melb. charmer who has earned divorce and
much kindred fame in your city, has startled the
fellow-lodgers at the hotel she favors by passing
to and from the bathroom in her magnificent
dream-garb. It has a train, and a ‘waist,’ and a
scale of ruffles about the neck, and is preferred as
a decorative garb to the kimono. But the women
are all shocked.
“Names mentioned in connection with recent
English weddings seem fairly familiar to Aus-
tralians. One reads of the third Miss Duff,
daughter of late Gov. Duff (N.S.W.), as a bride.
Lord Hindlip, a small, pale youth with receding
chin, faintly remembered as a member of the
Brassey suite, is mentioned as a bridegroom.
Miss Buxton, daughter of ex-Gov. Buxton (S.A.),
has also been leading lady in- an altar pageant.
The Buxton bride’s mother, as Lady Victoria
Noel, was bridesmaid to Queen Victoria, and her
mother before that was lady in waiting to Queen
Adelaide. The descendant of these staid court
favorites has different tastes. She has travelled
much in little-known places, and knows all about
tobogganing, canoeing, etc.
“ Cleaver Portia Geach is giving an exhibition of
cabinet pictures at the Athenaeum Hall this week
and next. ‘ Tales from Tennyson ’ are illustrated ;
also Grimm’s ‘ Fairy Tales ’ have been drawn upon
for subjects. This class of picture show commands
a solid popularity in the Big Smoke.
“ A swagger party starts off for a cruise of th»
South Sea islands next month. There will be
some nice toothsome girls amongst them, and
cannibal subscribers will doubtless make a note of
the fact when they read this.
Yours Affectionately,
AKENEHI.
An astonishing tale of the kidnapping of a
wife by the Jenkins Government comes from S.A.
A miner named Camp—a comparatively affluent
citizen of nearly 60 and a perfectly sane individual
of good character—was in hospital, and there he
made the acquaintance of a woman patient aged
25. When they were convalescent he married
her, and they went to his home to live happily
and help along the birthrate. But they had
hardly commenced to live .-.happily when Jenkins’
policeman seized the wife and took her to a re-
formatory. It appears that she had been an in-
mate of the institution, putting in an indefinite
term, before she went to the hospital, and the
Jenkins State is so anxious to keep On maintain-
ing her that it won’t even discharge her to her
husband’s keeping. What most enrages the
old miner, however, is that, after he had
written a number of letters requesting’ the release
of Fanny Camp, he at last extracted a cold official
document from the Jenkins “ State Children’s
Department,” saying it wasn’t prepared to dis-
charge “Fanny Carbis” just at present. He
wants to know, first, what a State Children’s De-
partment is doing with his full-grown wife, and,
second, whether the Jenkins department can’t
read the name on the lady’s marriage certificate,
and he intends to speak severely to Jenkins in the
American language about it.

INFLUENZA CURED.
“Oh it’s only a cold,” you say. Perhaps it is; but an Influenza epidemic rages everywhere. Nearly
every cold turns to this dread complaint, because at this time of the year your blood is poor—it hasn’t strength
enough to ward off the germs of Influenza. Thousands are sick in bed with Influenza—your turn may be next.
Remember, Influenza leaves its victim a weary, wretched wreck. An attack may last only a week, but
the deadly poison in your blood remains. Your lungs, chest, heart and nerves are permanently weakened, and
you fall a victim to Pneumonia, Bronchitis, Consumption, Rheumatic Fever, or racking Kidney Troubles.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People never fail to ward off Influenza or cure its ill effects—because
thev purify the blood and sweep away its poisonous germs. Every dose helps to make the warm, fresh blood
which drives all poison from the system. Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills enrich the blood, brace up the nerves,
strengthen the lungs, and give new power to every organ of the body. But take them now. Here’s
proof of Cure
“ I caught a cold last June, which settled in my head,” says Mr. J. J. Talbot, 6 Smith’s Terrace, Edward-street, Wagga
Waa-o-a “ I turned feverish, and had horrible boring pains over the head and eves. My legs, arms and back ached all over.
T turned quite sick in the stomach. I couldn’t eat anything-. All food tasted just like paper. The doctor told me I had
influenza very badly, and I had to take to bed. The prescriptions did not strengthen me, and I was so weak and ill that I
didn’t care whether I lived or died. Then a friend who had been cured by Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills told me they were the very
W thinsr to build up my blood and drive out all disease. And I found they were. Even three doses made my head a little
clearer One box drove away the aching- pains and created an appetite. A few more boxes made me the strong, hearty man
again that I have been ever since.”

PERSONAL ITEMS.
There is now George Turner, jun., at the
Vic. bar, and the firm is George Turner and Son.
A very old inhabitant writes to say that
he knew Victorian Premier Bent when he was the
Brighton garbage man in ’54 or thereabouts.
A Sydney Tory who holds family prayers
before retiring, inserts a clause asking for special
blessings on the Deform candidates and the
Japanese army.
Late reputed millionaire Angas, of S.
Australia, left only one son and one daughter.
Yet he was a m m who could afford to prop up
the birth-rate a little.
Of two candidates for a certain N.S.W.
city seat one has confined his drink the last fort-
night to hot milk, the other to hot rum ; one
smells like a cowyard, the other like a distillery,
and bets are on as to which will first go down.
Recently died at Fremantle (W.A.) one
Samuel Walcott, aged 80 years. The old gentle-
man lived in Fremantle 73 years, and during that
time never went a longer journey than to Perth,
12 miles away. He didn’t go there until the rail-
way came along.
Adelaide on Saturday uncovered its statue
of M‘Douall Stuart, the first explorer to cross the
Australian continent. And the “ great Australian
daily,” the S.M. Herald, which knows all about
Japanese generals and the politics of Lapland,
called him “M‘Dougall Sturt.”
One moderately-bloated, but quite un-
known, landlord got into Vic. Leg. Council, un-
opposed, at very little trouble. A single speech,
a nomination paper, and a deposit were all that
were needed to elect Martin Cussen, of Mooroopna,
farmer and grazier. A Rodney farmer, seemingly,
and that is all that is known of him.
The late W. Hugo, of Adelaide Bushmen’s
Home, travelled the S.A. bush for some years as
a missionary. He was known as “William,” and
would give no surname. He refused to take a
lift, and also to drink tea. Being sufficiently
advertised by these eccentricities, he finally got
a very snug billet. He then declared hitnself to
be a nephew of Victor Hugo. Late millionaire
Angas’s idea of the Bushmen’s Home was a good
one. It didn’t keep one type of man off the
drink, but it gave another kind a chance of a little
quiet comfort.
FBIEDENTHAL, PIANIST.
Rev, “Bleeds” Fitchett, giving hints to
Melbourne Argus on “How to prepare a ser-
mon” :
The preaching that draws a crowd and holds it unre-
laxingly has about it an atmosphere of unseen worlds.
Precisely; and the usual Fitchett article on politics
has about it an atmosphere of unhappaned facts.
Deplorable par. now going the rounds of
the English papers :
The Prince of Wales has written an able paper, entitled
! Notes on the postal issues of the United Kingdom
during the present reign,” and recently he read it himself
before the London Philatelic Society. The future King
is a believer in the Carlylean doctrine of Work.
Work !
Some men do have to battle for their
seats. In 1894, ex-Age compositor, Alf. Bailes,
just lost his Bendigo seat. In ’97 he won it by 9
votes—Bailes, 1981; Lazarus, 1972. In 1902 he
scraped through with 9 to the good—Bailes, 1592 ;
Abraham Harkness, 1583. And now, in a triangular
duel, he wins by a whole 30—Bailes, 992 : Laborite
Glass, 962.
Tetley Gant, who has been made Chair-
man of Committees in the Tasmanian House of
Dodery, is mentioned in Walch’s “ Red Book.”
lhe record of Gant’s public services before he
went into Parliament the other day is that he was
chairman of a graveyard. Now his billet is to
, a ., u P to President Dodery the corpses of Bills
killed in Committee.
For the first time for just upon a quarter
of a century there will be no Ham in Vic. Parlia-
ment. Old Cornelius Job, who has sat for Mel-
bourne for over 20 years, has given the State a
rest, and David, who is nearly as long-standing a
Calamity, was left at the bottom of the poll for
Veihngton, which had returned him without
a murmur since 1886.
Dr. Kevin I. O’Doherty, the fine old
Queensland relic of the Young Ireland days,
found lately that Gratitude isn’t dead. Through
• a^e a , . infirmities he had it in his mind to
° • , U P fi JS tw °. °r three small Government ap-
pointments—which meant his living. Two well-
known Bnsbane doctors, who heard of it, promptly
came aiong with offers to relieve the veteran of
Hri w !, actua . 1 Wol 'k, leaving him nothing to do but
-.x ~ e f.W. The Government agreed, and
the old patriot is thus fairly provided for.
Sydney Town Clerk Nesbitt seems to be
as badly afflicted with disordered eloquence as
Dan O’Connor ; his official correspondence —i s
shown by the published letters re the Bacchus
Marsh Concentrated Milk case—shows none of
the usual official restraint, but splashes eloquence
about as if it was being hurled out of a bucket.
Given a habit of versifying, which may develop,
and Sydney’s Nesbitt will rival Melbourne’s
Fitzgibbon.
Professor Towar, ex-Principal of Rose-
worthy (S. A.) Agricultural College, seems to have
rather enjoyed his two years’ sojourn in the Crow
State. The Board of Inquiry’s report, which led
to his resignation, shows that during the sessions
of 1903-4 (88 weeks in all) Towar was absent from
the college only 127 times. This was consequent
on a liberal and humorous interpretation of the
Minister’s suggestion that he should endeavor to
see as much of the country as possible.
Dreadful slab from the Parliamentary poet
Caldwell on Handyside, M.P. of S.A., who died
suddenly the other day :
Peace to his ashes ! He will walk no more
Amongst his fellows in the noisy street ;
Nor will he enter the Assembly door
When public duty bids the members meet.
Caldwell turns out about 30 lines of this kind of
thing whenever anybody in S.A. dies, or gets
better, or in any way comes before the public eye.
B. C. Harriman, of Yic. Law Department,
lately deceased, was a classmate of Blackmore, the
novelist, at Tiverton school. Harriman was a
kindly man, about the most noted and most
liberal-minded of permanent heads in the Vic.
Law Department. When Isaac Isaacs, the Beech-
worth boy, was found a billet in the Protho-
notary’s office, by Premier Kerferd, afterwards a
Judge of the Supreme Court, Harriman worked
the oracle with the Minister to allow the brilliant
youth to attend at the University during office
hours. Isaacs owes much to Kerferd and
Harriman.
“B.” : The late Alexander Oliver owned
the official mind in a high state of development
and training. That mind is generally a cross
between the literary and the clerkly. Even as a
sportsman Mr. Oliver, balancing his gun on one
arm, suggested the penman who took down flying
thoughts as well as foxes. His Parliamentary
draftsmanship has had more than 30 years’ praise,
but truly N.S.W. draftsmanship is a sorry enough
feature of Parliamentary history. Still in many
c uses it was the House which spoiled his work. As
a high public officer of the Critchett Walker type
Mr. Oliver deserves his niche.
“Andy” Dawson, the Minister for
Defence, had one curious experience. He
was one of the first to go to the Kimberley
rush 20 years ago, and was one of the party of
diggers who paid the skipper of a schooner £1
for a passage from Wyndham to Port Darwin.
The passengers had to feed themselves, and
they thought four days’ tucker would be ample.
The skipper, however, filled up with stores,
and the way that passage was prolonged was
a caution. For days Melville Island would
rise up almost alongside, and the men would
turn in, confident that daylight the following
morning would see the schooner at anchor at
the Port. But the morning would reveal the
island almost out of sight and the schooner
beating up again, the skipper explaining that
she had been driven off during the night. This
went on for 15 days, until all the stores on
the schooner were consumed at famine prices,
and then the little vessel reached port. On
landing the skipper was burnt in effigy. To
“ Andy ” fell the task of delivering the funeral
oration, and he made it so caustic that it
penetrated the hide of the skipper, who came
ashore with many oaths to “chew up” the
orator whom he said he would know by his
voice. “ Andy ” stepped up to him in the pub
and said, “Would you know my voice?”
“ Why, yes, sonny,” replied the bully, meekly ;
“ come and have a drink.”
G. F. Cleland, of the firm which makes
about two-thirds of the 20,000 gallons of pure
olive oil which S. Australia will produce this
year, told a party of visitors lately how the
business began. The Clelands are nephews
of Samuel Davenport, one of S. Australia’s
old pioneers—the doyen of the gardeners and
wine-makers of the State. Davenport planted
the first seedlings about 40 years ago ; young
Cleland borrowed Mrs. Davenport’s sausage
machine, minced the berries, and spooned off
2gal. of oil. Even that took some mincing, for
a ton of berries only yields 40 gallons of oil,
worth about Bs. a gallon. They don’t use
Mrs. Davenport’s sausage machine now.
Related of North of Ireland native, Tam
Duncan, M.L. Minister for Lands, who is com-
monly cartooned wearing a kilt and a plate of
porridge, that he was taken to task by a Liberal-
Prohibitionist in the Wairarapa lately: “The
idea that whisky kills the microbes in water is a
fallacy that has been exploded by science ; alcohol
is not fatal to microbes,” remarked the cold-tea
apostle, “Maybe,” rejoined Duncan, in his slow
style. “Maybe—but a’ thenk it disables them
somewhat.” It is the only joke Duncan is known
to have made.
NOT FIT FOR PUBLICATION.
CHILD : “Oh, uncle, if aunty were to die people would call you a widower, wouldn't they ?"
MAN : “ Yes, girlie, I suppose they would.”
CHILD : “ But what would they call you if you were to marry again? ”
MAN (in a whisper): “A dashed fool! ”
Thorold Waters, who, whilst travelling
along the Inky Way, cultivated a sweet tenor
voice, is off to Europe soon, to have it
finished. Waters graduated on suburban journal-
ism, and has been on the staffs of Sydney Tele-
graph and Melbourne Age. On the Age, he
had charge of Bent’s Parliament, and a man who
can listen to Bent three nights a week and still
keep a sweet tenor voice is something of a prodigy.
“Melb.”: Maloney had his first conspicuous
innings in the Keps over the Government Policy
debate. The matter of his speech was excellent,
and Maloney’s flamboyant manner catches on well
with the Representatives. His speech evidently
pleased all round, even if only as a work of rhetoric
and elocution. An infusion of his warmth would
benefit other speakers. They need not be so
coldly business-like merely because Chamberlain
is cold or Cuyler Hastings is frozen. Maloney
uses his arms freely, and semaphores about, and it
is evident that the passion with which he is
charged to the muzzle is genuine. If an orator
is thrilled himself, it goes a long way. Besides,
the courtesy of Maloney is so beautiful.
The late William Lynch, solicitor, of Mel-
bourne, who died suddenly at the Australian
Club, had a splendid collection of pictures which
were sold the other day. Lynch’s picture-gallery
was the old Catholic Church at Brighton, built by
Father Niall away in the fifties, when Dr. Goold
was bishop. Lynch’s house was built right up
against the old church, which became part and
parcel of his home. When Father Niall built the
little brick place fifty years ago, he never dreamt
that one day it would be hung with Fra Angelicas
and Bellinis. His own pictures were probably
bought at Stanley’s in Lonsdale-street, at half-a-
crown a-piece.
Tummy Bent, who is not always incapable
of saying the artful thing in the right place, some-
times pauses in his platform ramblings to mention
that he was denied the advantages of a “ collidge
education ” when a boy. This is an effective
regret (especially when a drop of perspiration
chances to trickle down the side of his nose like a
tear), but it misrepresents the fundamental cause
of the old man’s ignorance. Blastiferous Bent was a
strong-willed citizen even in his knickerbocker
days, and his rugged progenitor used to whop him
for playing “wag.” White-haired Melbourne
identities chuckle over the recollection of little
Tommy Bent being pushed to school by his father —
in a wheelbarrow. The awful young urchin had
to be tied to the barrow. When his hard-working
dad had a better use for the barrow, boy Tommy
missed a day’s schooling.
The recent announcement of the death of
Mrs. Dry served to revive an interesting story of
Van Diemen’s Land. Deceased lady, herself a
Tasmanian native, was the widow of Richard Dry,
whose father was one of the first Irish rebels
transported to the island. Dry senior, the emi-
nent convict, bequeathed something more than a
fine estate to his son Dick (born in 1815 at Laun-
ceston). Dick, as a young man, was elected to the
Legislative Council, and there he headed the re-
bellion of the “Patriotic Six” against the British
Government system of charging all its heavy gaol
and police expenses to the local Treasury. In
1851 Dick Dry, the hereditary battler for justice,
was appointed Speaker of the Council. In 18C8
he took a trip to England and came back with a
handle to his name. Eleven years later he died,
Premier of the State where his father had landed,
a “lifer,” at the beginning of the century.
“ Pressman ” writes :
Old Scotch Jock Nimmo died in the Scotland he loved,
and whose national poet he quoted at all times, and in all
places, and under every circumstance. Twelve years ago,
he left Victoria in disgust because he had been prosecuted
as one of the directors of the Premier Building Society, of
which “ Jimmy ” Mirams was founder and secretary. The
Premier was the first financial society to go under, and
Victoria was wildly indignant, and Mirams was made the
awful example. Later on, worse trespassers than Jimmy
were dragged from their cellars, but the public had got
used to the business, and become perverted, and convic-
tions couldn’t be got. I was in court every day during
the long trial of the Premier directors. Every day, at
lunch-time, John Nimmo would stroll up to the reporters’
table and, with tearful eye, remark that he didn’t care for
himself, but his heart was broken for “ the dear old wife.”
When the verdict of acquittal against all, except Mirams,
was brought in, the foreman said that Mr. Nimmo left the
court without a stain upon his character, but another of
the jurymen promptly rose and said that the jury hadn’t
agreed to that. Mirams handed up to Chief Justice
Higinbotham a bulky set of reasons “ why sentence
should not be passed upon him,” and Higinbotham took a
night to read over the ponderous MS., which was like a
novel on its way to the publisher.
Harry Newman, M.P., just dead at Orange
(N. S. W.), had a personality. For 40 years he lived
at Lucknow—the locality of one of the richest
gold mines of the “patchy” kind in N.S.W., and
they were 40 years of strife and of varying for-
tune. As miner, storekeeper, speculator, and
politician Newman made and spent much money.
His “cellar” at Lucknow held rare wines that you
could get perhaps nowhere else out of Sydney and
Melbourne, and he was fond of dispensing a lavish
and ostentatious hospitality. When the Lucknow
mines, after many sensational developments, in
most of which Newman took a prominent part,
passed over to a big English co., which dispensed
with Newman’s services and installed Warnford
Lock and a johnny staff in the management, New-
man worried considerably and constantly intrigued
against Lock. Finally the mines went over to
Newman’s control again; but their happy days
seemed to be past. But he had, or professed to
have, an indomitable faith in their possibilities,
and at the time of his death was working hard to
get capital “to restore Lucknow to its old position
as a gold-producer.”
An analysis of the occupations given by
the candidates at the Victorian elections panned
out as follows. For the Council: 8 storekeepers,
manufacturers and merchants, 1 newspaper pro-
prietor, 9 “gentlemen” (this, by the way, seems
a splendid occupation for our boys), 8 graziers,
1 contractor, 3 farmers, 6 barristers and solicitors,
1 butcher, 4 auctioneers, 2 engineers and archi-
tects, 6 shareholders and investors, 1 land-owner,
1 medical practitioner, 1 brewer, 1 State school
teacher, and 1 secretary. For the Assembly: 9
agents, 1 stone cutter, 2 contractors, 3 printers
and publishers, 13 barristers and solicitors, 4
investors, 1 laborer (Frank Anstey of Brunswick),
1 artist, 3 travellers, 1 meat-salesman, 1 machine-
maker, 5 legal managers and managers, 1 painter,
1 hay salesman, 4 accountants, 6 secretaries, 10
auctioneers, 2 builders, joiners and carpenters,
1 wood-turner, 2 surveyors and engineers, 2
bricklayers, 4 “gentlemen,” 14 storekeepers,
manufacturers and merchants, 2 bootmakers, 2
engine-drivers, 1 hatter, 8 journalists, 1 wig-
maker, 13 graziers, 1 engraver, 1 cutter, 1 draper,
13 farmers, 1 watchmaker and jeweller, 1 baker,
2 miners, 1 director, 1 architect, 1 valuer, 4 hotel-
keepers, 1 medical practitioner, 1 bookseller, 3
State school teachers, and 5 railway employees.
Roaring Bent’s occupation was given as “Premier,”
and that of James Howlin Graves for Upper
Goulburn as “grazier and Executive Councillor.”

TOM (disgustedly, from below): “ Just my luck!
When there’s a parson there ain’t any girl.”
“ W.J.W.” : In reference to “Incubator’s”
par. (8., 3/3/’O4) re turkeys. If supplied with
eggs and well fed, I believe these birds would sit
all the year round. At our place some years ago
a flock of turkeys ran almost wild in a paddock
full of thistles, hut came home to roost at night.
One evening we missed one of the hens. A careful
search was made, but she could not be found.
Long after, when the thistles had pretty well died
off, I came across the remains of the old turkey
in the paddock. Though dead, she was still
sitting on a couple of stones in a well-formed nest.
This is the only case of the kind I have ever seen,
as the birds seldom forego their food; but I have
often known them to sit for three and four months
at a stretch.

“D.” : Read a Bulletin par. re cattle
being drowned at crossings to an old drover
yesterday. “In my time,” he said, “there were
rivers outback that moved ; and all I had to do
was to pick out a spot where the current was swift
and walk ’em over. The water was going that
fast they hadn’t time to sink in it.”
“ Nomad ” writes in a scattered sort of
strain from Westralia :
A woman shrieks painfully (Aboriginaliar col., 14/4/’O4)
re, the delinquencies of Biljim and his mate on the
Gascoigne. Her story is a palpable lie. But why do the
women and parsons who object to the matrimonial
arrangements of bushmen harp on the cruelty of the
thing? I have met scores of “combos” here and in
Queensland —drovers, squatters, prospectors, etc.—but
have never known or heard of a case in which their women
were ill-treated. A man may ill-use his wife, but very
seldom his mistress, and that rule holds good in spite of
color.
A young gin, employed as housemaid on a Gascoigne
cattle station, ran away twice in one week —first with a
passing drover, second time with a blackfellow. On each
occasion she was tracked and brought back, but not
otherwise punished. She ran away Decause the white
man in charge—the only white on the station—was too
moral. She did not “ hide her face in my frock ” to tell
me this, but looked me square in the eyes, showing a per-
fect set of teeth, and evidently thinking she gave a very
sufficient reason.
A lucky fossicker on the Gascoigne bought a dress—a
Christmas present for his gin. It was one of those long
loose things that fasten down the front; pale blue satin,
with lace trimmings and a red silk lining—very neat. It
cost the digger £5, but, as it was “ Maudie’s ” only gar-
ment, and she—partly owing to the heat, partly to the
lining—generally preferred to wear it unfastened, flying
free, the effect was more striking than beautiful.
There have been cases of cruelty—they are all things of
the past. The law is impartially and strictly adminis-
tered nowadays. Anderson, the notorious Bendhu nigger-
slayer, was only released the other day, having served
fully three years of his sentence, so that flogging one or
two natives Ito death, besides cruelly torturing two baby
girls, is a serious offence in Westralia—quite equivalent to
stealing a tin of baking-powder in N.S.W.
The Bulletin isn’t quite sure that the fact of
Maudie, the gin, wearing her blue and red frock
unfastened down the front is absolute refutation
of the previous correspondent’s charges of cruelty
and immorality, but. the matter may pass. It
takes all sorts of logic and aborigines to make a
world.

Boat on Brisbane River. Four gins at the
oars tugging for all they are worth against wind
and tide. Buck blackfellow lolling at ease in the
stern hailed by passing craft with, " Where to,
Harry?” “Oh, just takin’ these plurry women
down the river for a blow.”
“ So-So” : Met two trappers
rcently who drive heavy loads of
rabbits over hilly country, and never
use a breeching-strap. Both sit on
the front of the waggon, and when
a steep hill occurs, they affectionately press their
feet against the horse’s hindquarters. They have
feet like tombstones.

The S.A. Insolvency Court, the other day,
had before it a fine example of the sturdy, inde-
pendent, anti-socialistic farmer that the city daily
papers talk so much about. He had held 4000 or
5000 acres of land near the Murray for four or five
years at a rental of an acre—and had only paid
one year’s rent! He had got one lot of seed wheat
from the Government, and hadn’t repaid it. Then
he had got from the State an advance to get
another lot of seed wheat, had reaped 350 bags of
wheat and cut 22 tons of hay, and hadn’t repaid
that advance either. “ Didn’t you pay the Govern-
ment back?” the Commissioner asked. “No,”
he said, “it didn’t strike me that I ought to.”
What a fine, manly spirit of independence the
sand does breed ! So different from the poor
spirit of the pampered factory.
“ Oatley ” : There is an ancient cockatoo
at Tam worth (N.S.W.) that is a pretty useful
sort of bird. When everyone living in the house
goes out the orders for the tradespeople are left
with cocky, who delivers them verbally: “Two
loaves, please, baker,” or “ A pound and a half of
steak, butcher, and mind it’s rump steak, not like
the last,” and so on. Though the orders vary, he
never makes a mistake. Cocky is incorruptible,
like Maximilian Robespierre, and when with a
former owner, if the maid-servant asserted falsely
that the master was out, cocky would shriek out:
“ It’s a lie; he’s in !”
A TRIP TO CHINATOWN.

“Bushman”: Has any-
body experimented to _ find
the range of an ant’s eyesight?
A lot of people think when
they see an ant climb up a
bullrush, fool about for a
while on the top of it, and
then climb down again, that
he did it out of pure stupid t /.
They know nothing. He wt n t
up to get the lay of the coun-
try and to locate any dead
flias, beetles or other game
that might be within a three-
mile radius of his lookout.
I threw a stick at a bull-dog
ant that was taking a stroll
about 15 yards away. He
threw up his head, looked all
round, and located my camp
at once. Then he
made a wide detour
around me, keeping
his face to the foe all
the time. About 20
minutes later he re-
turned humping a
beetle skeleton (it
was no earthly use
for food, so I reck-
oned him up as an
ant doctor). He
made the same
circle round me and
tripped over the
skeleton about 18
times through try-
ing to look whether
I was going to throw
another stick at him.
There is a lot of
the “ push ” instinct
about ants. If a
bed is disturbed
each is trying to
push his neighbor
out to the fight,
while the real wary
ones sneak round
behind you and take
you unawares. Also,
when in company with
two or three other festive
ants, one ant meets a maimed
ant coming home from a football match with one leg
missing, they set upon him and bash him unmerci-
fully. Altogether the ant is a useless, low-down,
thieving rowdy, and is only held up as an example
of thrift and industry by men who have met an
occasional spectacled ant and listened to his yarns.
“E.L.L.”: Like her white sister, the
Papuan lady sometimes finds her lord’s attention
monotonous, and longs for “a change.” Some
local masher, with loops in the lobes of his
ears large enough to hold a watch-glass, and
wearing a shell nose-bar lOin. in length,
has caught her fancy, and she loses very little
time in letting him know —by surreptitiously
slipping a betel into his hand or in some other
Papuan feminine fashion —that she has suc-
cumbed to his charms. If he is a gentleman, he
will get under the lady’s residence after dark, and

a string passed through the floor. A gentle tug
informs the lady, who has the other end tied to
her little finger, that her lover waits. Making
some excuse to the “old man,” she slowly walks
out and seats herself by the fire, until certain that
said old man is really asleep. The light tapping
of a stick guides her, and she disappears among
the luxuriant foliage of that tropical country,
where the nude co-respondent waits.
OUR PARSON.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Down through the aisles of the tall old gums,
Sanctu’ries shady and dim ;
There where the fluttering, feathered folk sing,
Sounding a thanksgiving hymn ;
Past where the swift dancing waters emerge,
Into the heat and the glare,
Rides our bush parson adown the track,
Up on his old bush mare.
Riding out under the roof of his God,
Into his church of the Bush ;
Down where the little mock waterfalls plash,
Breaking the soft summer hush ;
Down through the gullies where tall dank ferns
Lift their green arms to the air
Comes our old parson along the track,
Up on his old brown mare.
Over the rain-swollen stream he comes,
Plods through the sodden soil,
Putting his own deep sorrows aside
To lighten our daily toil.
Even the worst of us don’t blaspheme—
Somehow forget to swear ;
He has ridden his way to our hardened hearts—
He and his scarecrow mare.
There was old Jerry, the hopeless wreck ;
There was Jem Watson’s son ;
There was that girl from the Cross Forks —ay,
And many another one—
Stockmen and drovers and derelict hulks,
Almost too many to tell,
Snatched by our parson on his old mare,
Out of the jaws of Hell.
And when the thread of our cold hard lives
Breaks on the Spinner’s loom,
And we flow out on the ebbing tide,
Fearful to meet our doom—
Even the worst of us sinful chaps
Of Heaven will not despair :
There’ll be our parson to point the track,
Up on his old gaunt mare.
HIPHEN.
“ Hiphen ” : Only once have I tried to
be soulful to a male animal. Never again ! It
was at Healesville. Four of us
were away for rest and quiet, and
sought for both by playing solo-
whist into the hours that are the
size of a Japanese admiral. It
was about 2.30 one morning that a
friend and myself went to the room
that we shared, high in the tower
of the hotel. I happened to look
out of the open window and there
was a magnificent view unfolded.
The whole countryside was illumin-
ated by a faint, opalescent glow.
Then gradually the wind crept up.
Its roaring could be heard miles
away through the trees before the
storm reached us. It sounded like
a mountain torrent broken loose.
The clouds came down from the
mountains till all the valley ap-
peared like one great sea of foam.
Over all was a soft, pinky glow.
I waxed enthusiastic. Hastily
calling my friend to the window,
I said, “Look at that. Isn’t it
magnificent? Yet Australians go
to Switzerland for scenery. It re-
minds me of an impressionist’s
masterpiece. Doesn’t it you ? ”
He looked out of the window
vacantly and scratched his chin.
“Um—yes!” he remarked. “By
gosh! though, I can’t get over
that last hand. If you had led the
three of clubs through him he ”
There was a short struggle, and as
the cold, grey dawn was breaking
I buried his body on the mountain
side and went to bed.
Ernest Favenc : I have found out lately
that the much-disputed term “never-never” goes
back a long way in our short history. But not
until pastoral settlement had reached the lower
courses of the western-flowing Lachlan and
Murrumbidgee does the word appear to have been
used. Then it seems to have borne the sense of
“ without limit.” Unknown plain country gives
you much better the idea of a boundless expanse
than does unknown mountainous or rugged coun-
try, and as the plains grew vaster to the westward,
so the term was used to express the limitless un-
known. The term “Jackeroo,” which with us
was first used as an equivalent to “ colonial
experiencer ” (one who gives his services gratis on a
station in return for the experience he is supposed
to gain) is, according to Stewart Russell, who
wrote the “ Genesis of Queensland,” a name given
by the Brisbane River blacks to the first white men
who rode down from the Darling Downs. Thev
were reported as six-legged animals, big dogs,
which had a leg out either side and a man’s body
on them. The blacks entreated the commandant
of Ipswich to send some soldiers out to shoot them.
As the colonial-experiencers were no favorites with
the old bushmen, it is probable that these seized
upon the taking name of “Jackeroo” as a vague
and ridiculous appellation.
“ Esmi ” tells the story of an unpardon
able sin:—
There were six of them, and they appeared to spend all
their evenings playing euchre in the back parlor of the
second class suburban pub. from which I get my supper
beer. At least, four of them played and the other two,
after the game was over, showed the losers what they
would have done. It was by offering them expert advice
on the game that I made their acquaintance. The general
favorite of the party was Bill—a really humorous cuss.
Noticing Bill’s absence for six consecutive nights, I asked
if he were ill, and Samuel told me he did not know, but
that he was “ano-class blank that no respectable bloke
would be seen with in the morgue.” I told Samuel that
I liked Bill, and therefore he had said too much or too
little. So he explained thusly : “ Well, you see, Bill got
chasing another bloke’s missus, and the other bloke
collared him. We didn’t think nothink of that, an’ stuck
to Bill and subscribed for a lawyer for him when the other
bloke went for a divorce. But, my oath, what came out
about Bill fair blew us out. The other bloke works in a
brewery, and he used to get a lot of bottled beer a week
for himself to take home. He said he got it on the square
and paid for it, but I believe the brewery say it was
crook. Well, anyhow, none of us set up to be no better
than the next, and as I said, we didn’t mind about the
other bloke’s missus, but when a bloke sneaks a man’s
missus he ain’t doing the square thing to drink her old
man’s beer as well, and that’s what come out about Bill.
In fact, it was missing the beer that put the other bloke
on the track of Bill. It was playing it down too low, so
we passed Bill out. Don’t you think it was a fair thing ? ”
I agreed that Bill’s offence was unpardonable if the
“ other bloke” could prove he came by the beer honestly-•
if otherwise, that Bill should be held “not guilty "—but
the point apparently was too subtle for them. I’m afraid
I have seen the last of Bill, and he was really a humorous
cuss.

Dr. W. E. Thomas’ Dental Establishment, 57 and 69
Swanston-street, Melbourne, a marvel of ornamentation,
comfort and up-to-date dental surgery. Whilst pictures
and statuary enchant the eye, and luxurious furniture
affords ease to the body, the latest discoveries in dental
science provide painless and effective dentistry. As Dr.
W. E. Thomas’firm are the only dentists in Australasia
who are members of the Manufacturers’ Association of
England and America his patients have the benefit, in
reduced charges, of the doctor’s ability to buy at first
cost, thus saving middlemen’s charges. This, conjoined
with the fact that he has a splendid staff of assistants
from the leading dentists of England and America, has
made the doctor’s establishment famous throughout the
Commonwealth, Tasmania and Maoriland.*

“ Curlew ” on the J.P. :
Have often noticed the manner in which the J.’sP. that
ran across Bulletin paragraphists always breathe heavily
and suspiciously as they lean on the pen to trace their
signatures. None of the J.’sP. I know are built quite
that way. Most of him inhabits a 12 x 6 partitioned office,
richly furnished with ledgers. He looks worried, and is
palpably troubled with liver. With a mind leatherbound
in his precious ledgers, he drives his signature recklessly
across the bottom of the paper, dabs his initials where
you point, and casts a weather-beaten scrap of “blog”
towards you as you depart so that you may blot his auto-
graph. Sometimes it is necessary to swear things, but
the Bible is invariably lost in some odd corner among
ancient files and worn-out day-books. Whereat the con-
scientious affidavit clerk takes the nearest memo.-book,
licks some of the dust off it, and murmurs a few words of
praise. The signature gets there all the same. If a man
in a decent line of business stopped to read half the docu-
ments presented to him in one day, he wouldn’t have
time for anything else but signing. Also, he might be
boycotted. ’Tisn’t always convenient to answer queries
in Mildura ’bout a local affidavit, though it may read all
right in Melbourne. Anyhow, he simply leans on the im-
punity clauses of the Act, and mixes as little J.P.-ism as
may be with his ordinary business.

“Eiddal” : Few of our native birds in-
dulge in polygamy to the extent of the wee tom-
tits that haunt the flood flotsam and jetsam on the
Murray. Here the cockbird — a frowsy dot of a
Turk with a blue cap, black bib, black coat-tails,
and cream vest —has a harem numbering over a
dozen. These tits are sociable little creatures, and
are, in places, the only signs of bird life the angler
can discern nowadays on the big trickle between
Albury and Yarrawonga.

Broken Hill, where sparrows once could not
live owing to the lead and sulphur fumes from the
mines, is now the home of numerous “colonies.”
Other small birds have also of late taken up their
residence in the town, and even cats, about the
most easily lead-poisoned of all animals, are now
able to rear large families.

“A.P.R.” : Saw a hawker recently smok-

“ Mandarin ” : Have noticed several refer-
ences by correspondents to the ‘ 1 cussedness of
the Victorian cocky. Reminds me that N.S.W.
is not behind in that inspect. For pure
downright cussedness and political contra-
diction the Central Cumberland fruit-
grower takes the bun. He’s a 1' reetrader
to the backbone, but wants a prohibitive
duty on Sicilian lemons and other imported
fruit. That is an exception, he tells you.
He thinks he remembers getting 255. per
case for fruit in Hairy Parkes’s time, and
fondly imagines that he’d get 30s. now, if it
wasn’t for bad legislation. Curses the
Federal duties, which he (the consumer)
says he has to pay; double curses the
Maori land fruit duties, which he (the pro-
ducer) says he also has to pay; and attributes
his present day hardupishness to the
socialistic and democratic trend of legisla-
tion. He is either too apathetic or idiotic
to co-operate, but continues to pay the agent
Is. per case commission, same as he did in
the boom-times, and trusts that something
goodwill happen. The “Queensland fly”
is troubling him now, and has eaten up
almost everything chewable, barring the
mortgage.

“Marat”: Nowadays, parents of
Chow-African heroes haul the blanket of
oblivion over that part of the son’s career.
Put up for the night with a family on the
Southern line, and the youngest son had
just started to tell me about his brother
Bill “who had been to the war,” when the
old man fell on him, and, after cuffing him
round the head, handed him one-sixteenth of
an inch of greasy candle and packed him off to
bed. “ He’s got too much to say,” was the only
explanation he tendered. I didn’t see Bill; he
came home about 1 a.m., and was in bed when 1
left to catch the 9.30 train. I think he habitually
hid himself in the scrub for fear somebody who
knew about his military career should see him.

“A.H.T.”: Be Georgina cattle smash
(B. 5/5/W). Recall a bigger one at Wonaminta
Water hole on the Mount Brown road, west of the
Darling, in the drought of ’B4. Some 1300 bul-
locks, five days without water, were travelling
from Bourke to the Darling, and got away from
the drover (Bruce Taylor, whose horse, like the
horses of his men, was dead beat), lhe cattle
rushed the steep stony side of the water-hole,
with the result that 600 were smothered and
trampled to death. Also your correspondent has
omitted one of the main tools of Burgess when
crossing cattle, viz. : “Tom Tit,’ the horse he
always used in the water. When Jack Burgess
climbed on a ringing mob to straighten them, the
horse would swim about down stream waiting for
his owner to dive or swim to him. I have seen
this horse swim the Darling when a banker, 17
times backwards and forwards, and never put a
foot on bottom. Also he earned his owner a big
“divvy” during the ’9O flood crossing the mails
for Cobb and Co. Harnessed to a canvas boat

HE : “ Why, look for the hose, of course."
with small wheels, and driven by Burgess, he
negotiated deep and shallow water alike for the
seven miles between Wilcannia and the 70-Mile
Sandhills.

“ Matchbox ” : Found near Horsham
(Vic.), a few days ago, a skeleton supposed to
be that of an aboriginal, because (says the Hor-
sham Times) “atone time aboriginal corroborees
were held in that particular spot.” Was it a
custom of the aboriginal to dance over his dead
cobber’s grave ? I thought he only danced on his
missus occasionally.

Alexander Oliver, who died last week,

known work was done lately when he reported on
the Federal Capital sites for the N.S.W. State
Government. While he was Parliamentary
draughtsman he edited “ Oliver’s Statutes,” and
wrote heavy stuff for the S.M. Herald, and
lighter stuff for the Australasian and other
papers. Though he had only one arm (he lost the
other through an accident), he was an enthusiastic
fisherman and yachtsman, and was practically the
founder of what N.S.W. has in the way of a
Fisheries Department. _ Most of his literary
earnings he spent on his library, which is one of
the best in private hands in Australia.
British House of Commons occasionally
leaps far ahead of any Australian Parliament in
socialistic and restrictive legislation. Latest
example is a Bill —which has been favorably
received—making it an offence, punishable by fine
or imprisonment, to state an untruth in giving a
“ reference ” to a departing servant.

MAKES EASY
It is wearing enough to care for a child tor-
mented with teething troubles during the day,
but being up half the night with more of the
same is appalling! Both day and by night
all these troubles and fretfulness and the fever
—even the convulsions —can be avoided for
your little one by giving Scott’s Emulsion,
the greatest friend a mother ever had in her
nursery ! Prevent the trouble by beginning
early when the teeth are due. The remedy is
at the nearest chemist’s. It is Scott’s Emul-
sion ! It is the sure, safe road to easy teeth-
ing. Thousands of mothers throughout the
world have had cause to be grateful to Scott’s
Emulsion, which kept their little ones free
from pain during teething time. Get Scott’s
Emulsion, and have the house comfortable,
instead of upset. From our crowded files we
take this pleasant letter :
Wyman-street, Broken Hill, N.S.W.
August 26th, 1903.
Hear Sirs,—l would like to give you an
account of the benefit that my little daughter,
who has been delicate and fragile from birth,
Margaret Logan.
has derived from
Scott’s Emulsion.
It seems in-
credulous, the dif-
ference it has made.
She has gained
greatly in weight,
and has cut teeth
without any trouble.
On former occa-
sions, when cutting
her teeth before
having your Emul-
sion—she was very
ill; but, thanks to
your Scott’s Emul-
sion, she has had no
trouble whatever with the last teeth. She is
now 18 months old, and both my husband and
myself are delighted with the good that Scott s
Emulsion has effected. Yours faithfully,
F. Logan.

FISHER’S Phospherine
The Famous Cure for Headaches,
Indigestion, Gastritis & Liver Troubles!
A GRAND TESTIMONIAL.
Mr. THOMAS FORSYTH, of Ashfield, writes, and declares on oath, the following
“ I suffered from acute inflammation of the stomach, with a burning pain. My tongue got a
thick coating over it, and I constantly suffered from nausea. Why, I used to be almost con-
stantly vomiting. I consulted two doctors in Ashfield for years, without getting relief. But
in three weeks FISHER’S PHOSPHERINE completely cured me. lam Noble Grand for
the Loval Ashfield M U 0.0. F. I have been in the Lodge for 18 years. Most of the mem-
bers know of my illness. Five or ten drops of FISHER’S PHOSPHERINE always takes
away a sour taste in my mouth, and keeps my stomach in regular order. Let everyone know
of my case.”

Remarkable Testimony.
A Sydney Reporter interviewed Mrs. Elizabeth Wilson,
406 Harris-street, Ultimo.
“I understand, Mrs. Wilson, that you and your family have been using FISHER & CO.’S
PHOSPHERINK for some time past. Would you mind telling me if you have derived benefit
from it ? ”
“Benefit, indeed ! I should say so, or I would not waste my time talking to you. My husband
here can prove it also. I’ll swear to it if you like. I told you before what good it did me. Through
worry and overwork I became debilitated, grew nervous, had no proper rest at night, felt languid,
and, I’ll tell you more, often felt disinclined to take my regular meals. Anything seemed to upset me ;
I used to go to bed completely fagged out, falling off to sleep immediately in a dead sort of way, and
waking up in the morning unrefreshed. This continued for some time, until I, a strong woman, often
felt disinclined to exert myself. An inertness seemed to oppress me, which I feared would eventually
end all active work ; but from the time I took FISHER & CO.’S PHOSPHERINE I can honestly
say that all these troubles are a thing of the past.
“Whenever I feel a tired, weary feeling, a few drops (five I generally take) soon fix me up, and
I can do as much work as ever I could. 0

The Tuppenny-Tube Imperialist.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In his Guildhall speech, Chamberlain told the
people of London to learn to think imperially ;
and probably there was not one Londoner who
read the words who did not regard the advice as
needless in his particular case. Yet there is no
such thing as an Imperial sentiment in London.
There is not even patriotism. In the eyes of the
Londoner the British Empire extends from the
Bank to Shepherd’s Bush—the eight miles that
are covered by the Tuppenny Tube. As for Eng_-
land, that is one of London’s dependencies, and
in various corners of the globe he is aware that
there are a number of spots, useful in their insig-
nificant way to the Tuppenny Tube empire, which
he lumps together in the generic term of “The
Colonies.” To the England of the past, the
England of history, the Londoner will accord
some scraps of patronising respect, but the Eng-
land of the present is deemed merely an inferior,
but possibly necessary, part of the scheme of
things that enables the Eight Mile Empire to
endure. It is merely the means. The fog-swept,
germ-laden, crushed and blackened buildings
along the Tuppenny Tube constitute the end.
And how fervent is his devotion to that empire he
has built in his own imagination! How these
poor little street-bred people do vapor and fume
and brag about Harfleur and Poictiers and Agin-
court, as if the Tuppenny Tube had fought them
all.
When I crossed the Channel from Calais, a
young Londoner, who travelled with me from
Colombo, drew me proudly to the bows, and point-
ing where the distant fog was least thick, cried
triumphantly, “Ah ! there are the white cliffs of
Dover.” I glanced at the uninteresting landscape.
“ Isn’t that where Julius Caesar gave your fellows
a bad doing some time ago ?” I asked. My fellow-
traveller did not reply. He went to another part
of the boat, and ten minutes later I thought it
best to approach him. “I say,” I remarked, “I
didn’t intend to hurt your feelings ; I hope you’re
not offended.” “No, old chap,” he said, with
some hesitation, “ I’m not exactly offended, but I
don’t think that remark of yours about Julius
Caesar was in very good taste.”
In the streets of London, the evidences of Eng-
land’s work in the past are everywhere, and every-
where does the Londoner arrogate to himself the
credit for this work. He is fortified in his
conceit by an overwhelming ignorance which
seems something more than instinctive. It
is so thorough and well-grounded that it
must have been acquired by hard and
patient study. I never passed the Polytechnic
and other technical schools without expecting to
see on the notice-board among the subjects taught
“ Ignorance, 6s. a quarter.” You are prepared to
find the Londoner ignorant of foreign countries or
the outlying portions of the British Empire, but a
stranger is rather surprised when he discovers how
little the Londoner knows of his own land—even
of his own city. When I had seen enough of the
place to be filled with a proper disgust for it, a
captain of artillery asked me, one day, how I
would like to live in London. I replied that I
thought Captain Cook was the greatest man that
ever lived. “Well, old chap,” he observed,
“some of your fellows did excellent work at the
war.” Another professional man I met on the
mail-boat lost his temper with me because I main-
tained that Beaconsfield and Disraeli were one and
the same person. The Londoner, as a rule, knows
his London just about as well as he knows its his-
tory. He knows the place where he lives, and he
can find his way to the place where he works,
when it isn’t foggy, ‘but outside that he is as lost
as he would be on the banks of the Bogan. When-
ever you find a man standing on the kerb crying
because he has lost his way, and waiting for an
Australian or an American to come along and tell
him where he is, you know that he is a Londoner.
But his patriotism for the place he doesn’t know
is transcendent, marvellous, and an example to
the Australian who thinks much less of a far
better place. The very ’bus on which I used to
travel up the Strand flew at its bows a small
1 T "ion Jack as a gage of defiance to all foreign
vehicles.
ui tne colonies, the Londoner knows nothing
and cares less. The Tuppenny-Tube Imperialist
of the better-informed class regards Australia,
Canada, and South Africa much as l’ierpont
Morgan regards the individual Polish laborer in
his iron works. They are so much material, so
many tools of trade, and exist merely that they
may assist the one-shade-less-despised extra-
London English in the work of glorifying the Tup-
penny Tube. As for the uninformed Londoner,
meaning not the submerged tenth or even the
working classes, but everyone who does not take
an especial interest in international events, he is
hardly aware that such places exist. He knows
that Australia and Canada are on the maps;
South Africa is recalled by an almost forgotten
war, but that is all known of them. In our
conceit, we in Australia are in the habit of
regulating our national life by the feeling that
the eye of London is upon us. As a matter of
fact, Australia is almost non-existent to the mass
of Londoners. The success or failure of the Labor
or any other party troubles London not one-scrap,
for the simple reason that it isn’t aware of the
fact. The prevalent feeling in Australia is that
the first thing the Londoner does every morning
is to seize his paper and read the latest awful
news from Australia, and that, when the result of
the last Federal elections was cabled through,
London turned to its wife and announced, “ It’s
all over Maria, I’ve done with Australia now,”
while the whole of the big town was plunged into
grief. The truth was that the news affected Lon-
don just as the announcement of the death of the
oldest inhabitant of Burnt Creek affects the aver-
age reader of Melbourne or Sydney.
The Londoner’s idea of Australia, when you lead
him to it, is as comical in its way as the Australian’s
idea of London. He has got over the stage of
thinking everybody is black, but he still regards
the aborigines as a menace to life and property.
Invariably confusing Australia with Maoriland, he
will ask if the Maoris—pronounced “Ma-or-ies”
—are very troublesome about Melbourne,. and
it is difficult to make him believe that the
cowboy element is not prevalent, and lawlessness
tempered with frequent lynching does not repre-
sent the social condition of the people. “You
know about the perlice ’ere ? ” said a Whitechapel
girl to me once. “No,” I answered, “what about
them ? ” She looked up with the air of one who
meant to, save me. “If yer use a pistol ’ere they’ll
ang yer.” I expressed great surprise and horror
at a community being so lost to all sense of humor
as to prevent promiscuous shooting, and thanked
her for the warning.
Among the better educated of the Londoners
the separation of Australia as an independent re-
public is regarded as a foregone conclusion. “I
suppose you fellows will be setting up a nation of
your own when you get a bit more population,”
1 heard fully fifty times during my stay. There
is no ill-feeling about the expectation. The
Londoner’s instinct tells him what education has
tailed to tell many Australians—that it is useless
to quarrel with the inevitable. The average
Australian separatist, who pictures another
Lexington, with British warships in the ports and
a real live Australian George Washington securing
a final admission of independence, lets his conceit
run away with him. If Australia were to declare
independence to-morrow, all the Londoner would
do would be to turn over his paper lazily and
remark to his wife, “I see one of the colonies—
Australia or Trinidad or Antigua or some such
funny name—has broken away from us.” And
thenceforward he would regard Australia with
the respect that he accords to the United States
and other foreign countries, for the foreigner is
respected, though hated, while the colonial is
deemed an inferior, a lackey, a pawn to back up
the knights of England and the kings of London,
and to serve the interests of the Tuppenny Tube.
Australia is not alone as a colonial outcast.
Despite the stories told and the big English
emigration to Canada, less is known of that country
in London than in Australia. The Tuppenny-
Tube Imperialist cannot tell you whether Win-
nepeg or Montreal is the nearer, or whether Mani-
toba or Quebec is the wheat-producing area. The
Canadian emigrants are drawn from England—
the place that has colonised worlds —while London
continues to grow and become more and more
dependent upon the outsider for the breakfast
that will one day cease to be served. To emigrate
is still looked upon as something of a disgrace—a
last resort, like recruiting for the army, only more
blameworthy, seeing that the emigrant cannot be
in the same state of hopeless destitution as the man
who listens to the solicitation of the recruiting
sergeants of Trafalgar Square. One day a young
Londoner disappeared, and after weeks of fruitless
search, his friends discovered he had been caught
red-handed in a burglary and sentenced to seven
years. With heavy hearts they sought to break
the news to his anxious old mother, and when
finally she asked “Is he dead ? ” they told her the
awful truth. “Thank God ! it’s no worse,”
observed the old woman, piously, “ I thought ’e
might ha’ gone to the colonies.”
LONDON.
M‘G.
One of Adelaide’s most fashionable dress-
makers left for Zion city recently. A few weeks
previously a society dame ordered an evening
bodice, but when she informed Madame how low
it was to be cut the saved milliner refused
point blank to make it. She said it was
immodest, and that she wouldn’t risk her
chances of Heaven by making a _ bodice
in which another woman would frisk to
Hell. After all, Zion is, perhaps, the best place
for a fashionable dressmaker who ventures an
opinion on the modesty of her customers.
“ Steve” : Is there anything dangerous or
infectious about our Governor-General or our
State Exeresences? I notice S.M.H., whenever
mentioning them in its personal column, separates
them from the other personals with a “ rule” and
plenty of intervening space. Reminds me of the
old stockyard in a Sydney church, a barrier which
railed off the convict worshippers. English papers
mention Edward Rex without putting a fence
round him and laying waste an inch of the paper
to prevent him breaking out and mixing with the
general public. Is the Herald idea a precaution
against rabbits, or ticks, or what ?

Joseph Carruthers told a Muswellbrook
(N.S.W.) audience that the See Government
“ was undermining the manhood of the country,”
but if he were put into office he would restore it.
So Joseph is now a “ manhood restored ” party ;
£1 is sufficient to send, etc., etc.
Eight members have been returned unop-
posed in Westralia, and the Labor party has
secured no less than five of the seats. Two other
members are supporters of the mildly Liberal
Jimmy Government, and one old hardshell Groper
stands for the direct Opposition.
Though 35 seats have been obliterated
from N.S.W. Assembly, only three members have
definitely announced their intention to retire.
These are honorary Minister Hayes, auctioneer
Griffith of Albury, and S. T. Whiddon, a faithful
’bus horse of the old Reid party.
Up to time of writing it looked as if the
Bible-in-sehools crowd had fallen with a memorable
thud at the Victorian referendum. If that proves
to be the case, it will be “up to” certain parsons
to explain how they cooked or falsified the returns
at that private referendum which they say they
took on the subject.
Even the refusal of the Commonwealth
Postmaster General to be harried by State poli-
ticians wanting post-offices has struck Sydney
Telegraph as an outrage on State Frights. Post-
offices aren’t the State member’s business. The
State politician hasn’t to find the money for them,
and so he courts a little cheap popularity by
demanding a £lO,OOO post-office for a one-dog
village, and then denouncing “Federal extrava-
gance.” Also if the Federal P.M.G. is to be
harried, not only by the Federal members, but by
the contents of 12 State Houses of Parliament, his
whole time will be taken up refusing post-offices.
Henry Copeland, notwithstanding the bad
political company he has been keeping of late,
writes a friend to lose no time in killing off the
N.S.W. Legislative Council. “It was never much
good,” he writes, “but
with Federation it is
none at all.” And the
case is worse than
that.
THE RETURN OF THE PREMIER.
Premier See has returned to Sydney. Asked his opinion about Opposition leader Carruthers,
he said he would say nothing; but
Vic. Premier Bent lmde a beautiful blun-
der the day before the elections. In fulfilment of
a promise he, in Executive Council, constituted
the shire of Coburg a borough. Next day a Trea-
sury officer pointed out that the act was quite
illegal; that if Coburg was constituted a borough
the former shire of Coburg thereby ceased to exist,
and as it owed some £39,000, it couldn’t van-
ish in this off-hand fashion without seeing its
creditors about the matter. So there was another
hasty Council which lowered Coburg back to its
old status as a mere shire with a large debt.
A month or so back a row was raised over
the number of Italians (allegedly introduced under
contract) who were working in Westralian mines,
and an inquiry was demanded. A local mines
inspector then went round, and as a result it was
reported that the state of things wasn’t anything
like as bad as had been represented. But the
reason why it wasn’t as bad as had been repre-
sented wasn’t mentioned—there had just been a
wholesale deportation of Italians. One train
alone carried 35 through Kalgoorlie from the
Leonora district. Now local miners are wonder-
ing whether they have been deported for good, or
only hidden away till the row is forgotten.
It is commonly reported that if N.S.W.
Premier See resigns, the Labor party will commit
the amazing folly of barracking for spendthrift
Owe’Sullivan as his successor. If it does, the
party should thereafter go out and hang itself
gracefully on a nice green tree and be done with
itself. This isn’t the time when any body of poli-
ticians can afford to advertise itself as the Fool-
Loan party pure and simple.
The gerrymander in the interests of the
Victorian Deform fowl panned out all right. The
scheme won Eaglehawk for ancient patent pill
promoter Hay Kirkwood ; the mining vote of old
Eaglehawk, including California Gully and Sailor
Gully, gave Laborite Hampson 774 votes against
the Deformer’s 498; but the tack of the “safe”
agricultural district neutralised that and just
landed Kirkwood a winner.
J. Watchorn, M.L.C. (Tasmania) :
I have never heard anybody allude to the Council hut
who said they were thankful there was a Legislative
Council.
Would Mr. Watchorn like to put that statement
in an affidavit and swear to it ? Or would he
repeat it on his death-bed, assuming that he
believes in a Hereafter and expects to appear
before the Great White Throne ?
Carruthers’ ‘ 1 Liberal and Reform ” League
won’t select J. S. Hawthorne, present member for
Leichhardt, because he supported a small vote to
the Westmead Boys’ Home, an unsectarian insti-
tution though controlled by R.C.’s. The noisome
P.D.A. objects to Hawthorne on that account,
and the Carruthers organisation is the mere tool
of the P.D.A. It is going to be a dirty election
in N.S.W. this year—one of small men and mean
issues.
Two good and noble episodes of the Vic-
torian election were the defeat of dull old Samuel
Lancaster, the head and front of that “Reform”
movement which was really an effort of the rich
and swindling farmers of Kyabram to repudiate
their irrigation liabilities ; and the downfall of
Irvine’s disgraced ex-Minister of Lands, M'Kenzie,
in Upper Goulburn. The severe collapse of
Irvine’s friend Trashworth was another cheering
circumstance.
Premier Jenkins, the cantankerous book
hawker of S. Australia, now intimates that he
won’t allow the Commonwealth to build, at its
own expense, the much-needed railway to connect
Westralia with S.A. and the east unless he is
allowed to dictate the route and the gauge. The
route is to be by Tarcoola, S.A.’s very hopeless
goldfield, and the gauge is to be 3ft. Gin. So that
the whole line will require to be re-laid when
Australia goes in for a uniform railway gauge.
“ F.” writes :
All things considered, the strangest outcome of the
Victorian elections was Frank Madden’s return for his old
but very much reconstructed constituency. The dull,
forbidding fat man didn’t beat the sprightly Lumsden
with much to spare, but he got home, anyhow. One can
understand why Bent’s push at Brighton should vote for
Bent. The election of that huge outrageous person is
deplorable, but comprehensible. He has ever been a per-
sistent local jobber. But the supporters of Frank
Madden hope for nothing from him. Seemingly he is
elected on his relationship to the Waxcellency.
A plaint:—
District Court Judge Murray’s decision that a boy
bringing a written order from an adult may be legally
served with tobacco by a tobacconist knocks a disastrous
round hole in Dr. Ross’s Juvenile Smoking Act. The men
who build laws have not only to say what they mean,
which is sometimes hard enough ; "they have also to
struggle against the intense desire of Judges to decide
that they didn’t mean what they said. An Act forbidding
the sale of tobacco to children seems so plain that even
the most intricate Judge can’t decide that it means any-
thing, save that tobacco is not to be sold to children.
Yet a Judge decides, almost at the first try, that it really
means that tobacco is to be sold to any infant who brings
an order from an adult—apparently from any adult, or
from anybody purporting to be an adult. Something
like: “ Please give bearer apacket of cigarettes.—(Signed)
John Smith.”
MR. G. P. HUNTLEY, as Lord Cheyne in
“ Three Little Maids.”
N.S.W. Premier John See remarks “he
had only seen one person begging in Maoriland,
and that one was an Australian ” ; but he does not
propose to follow the M.L. example, and urge the
Federation towards higher Protection, and to him-
self put on a graduated land-tax and an absentee-
tax, nor to start State life and fire and accident
insurance offices, State collieries, and State
farming settlements. He is content to admire
pauper-free Maoriland, and to greet with horror
any proposal to put N.S.W. on the same path.
A Victorian girl-teacher lately lost her
father, whose interment took place on a Thursday.
She was ill on the Friday, but returned on the
following Monday. Sachse, Minister of Edu-
cation, deducted three days' pay (for Friday,
Saturday, and Sunday) from her small monthly
salary, though she was in reality but one day
absent without leave. This is the regular system
in Victoria now. If a girl-teacher gets a day off
on Friday or Monday she is also docked by the
dog-mean Government for Saturday and Sunday.
Federal Attorney-General Higgins, in the
Vic. law courts lately, struck the New South
Wales Chief Justice in the place where he badly
wanted it. Isaacs was arguing a case before
Justice Hood, and remarked that if a certain thing
were allowed “it would be making a scoff of the
law.” Hood interjected : “ Well, that has been
done before now, hasn’t it ? ” And Higgins said,
“ Why, it’s only the other day that the Chief
Justice of New South Wales was scoffing at the
law of his own State !” Then a thick misty
silence settled down on the court.
David Syme, whose paper has lately caught
a sort of Scottish glimmering of the humor of the
Yes-Noness of Reid, has taken an emphatically
positive-negative attitude towards the Labor
parties. While barracking for a Deakin-Watson
combine the Age uttered pathetic warnings to the
electors to have no truck with the Labor men at
the State election, and instructed them to vote
straight for Bent Thomas. The Age is more
radical for the Commonwealth than the State.
David is wise enough to bow to the people of Aus-
tralia, but conceited enough to think he still con-
trols those of Victoria.
Slice from London Daily Chronicle, for
the special benefit of Melb. Argus, which believes
that no country in the world has yet tried a State
bank :
There is nothing absolutely new in their (the Watson
Govt.’s) programme. They think that the tobacco and
liquor trades are “ripe lor nationalisation.” As for
tobacco, that has long been a State monopoly in France
and other European countries, whose example Japan is
about to follow. The Russian Government has recently
taken over the trade in drink, and the Gothenburg system
in Scandinavia is a long step towards national control.
Further, Messrs. M‘Gregor and Watson would like to
establish a Federal State Bank, such as some of the most
conservative countries have long possessed.
It is marvellous how much the Argus’ hundred
eyes can’t see —or won’t.
“ F.C.” writes about Bent’s victory :
The result of Bent’s comprehensive bellow at the State
of Victoria, which transpired last Wednesday, is to return
that unmannerly person to power with a much-diminished
majority—a majority which, in fact, may fade away at
almost any moment. Bent and the Tory press certainly
claim it as a “great Ministerial victory,” but analyses of
the figures show that these parties “are romancing as
usual. In the last Parliament Irvine had, to com-
mence with, 66 Deformers, against 15 Oppositionists
and 14 Labor men. To have merely held their own, in
the reduced House, the parties should have num-
bered—Deform 47, Opposition 11 and Labor 10,
yet the figures to-day are—Ministry 36, Opposition
11, Labor 19, Independent 2; so that Bent has
practically lost 11 seats in a House of 68, nine of which go
to the Labor party. If this is a great victory Bent is
welcome to it. The State as a whole thought so little of
the coarse, ignorant person who mistakes bullying for
statesmanship that it gave him the bare working majority
of four ; the citizens of Melbourne, who know Bent and
his manners and customs best, returned 11 Labor men and
two Oppositionists against eight Ministerialists ; and
Bent’s own employees, who naturally know him best of all
—the public and railway servants—emphasised their
opinion of their “ true friend ” by returning three Labor
men, all by heavy majorities.
Sydney Telegraph on the Federal capital
site discussion:—
The Government and most of the representatives of the
other States persisted that N.S.W., which was lured into
the Federation by the promise op the capital, &c., &c.
There is something pathetic about the struggle to
point out simultaneously, that N.S.W. was the
noble and beneficent creator of the Commonwealth
and that its G. Reid, by calling together the
Federal conference and bringing about the Federal
convention, was the author of the whole splendid
business—also that some base Victorian or S.A.
conspirator created the horrid object and “lured”
N.S.W. into it by false promises.
Deputations always rush newly-fledged
Ministers in the hope of profiting by a new man’s
inexperience. Q. Home Secretary Peter Airey is
besieged by people who want half-a-million or so.
Airey deals with them in a diplomatic manner
every time. A deputation recently inter-
viewed Peter with a view of securing financial
assistance for the badly bankrupt Brisbane
Hospital. Peter willingly offered to see Treasurer
Kidston about it, but mildly snorted when a
deputationist suggested charging ss. per head for
electoral rights the money to go towards main-
taining the hospitals throughout Queensland.
“Ah,” replied the political poet, “another poll
tax ? ”
This Vic. election has scraped oft' some
very ancient barnacles. That wonderful old joke,
Nat. Levi, whose Parliamentary uselessness ran
back 44 years, has been dropped. J. H. Abbott,
who was helping to run a paper at Bendigo 50 years
ago, has been squeezed out. Ballarat threw over
David Ham ; but he had been hanging on only 19
years—the same as Dowling, of Nelson, who is also
scraped off. John Gavan Duffy was beaten for
Dalhousie, which he began to represent more than
30 years ago, leaving Vic. politics without a Duffy
for the first time in 49 years. And Howling
Graves, who had been clinging pretty tight for 27
years, has been removed with extraordinary
violence.
East Fremantle (W.A.) District-Registrar
has asked the Revision Court to reinstate over
1400 names struck off the rolls at the instance of
the Tory “National Political League” on the
ground of “departure from.the district.” Evi-
dence showed that the objectors swore to having
visited every house to verify absence, but investiga-
tion proved that in one case the person objected
to had lived in the same house for 2G years. And
the National Association swore it called there and
couldn’t hear of him. There were many other
like cases, and as persons objected to were given
only one day’s notice, the objectors evidently ex-
pected a brilliant coup d? etat. But time was ex-
tended for a week on the facts coming out, and a
particularly vile dodge was struck on the head.
Sample of that flapdoodle which J. H.
Carruthers passes off as his policy for the saving
of N.S.W.:—
It was a lot of little political marionettes who posed as
the Labor party. Who had benefited the people hut the
great thinkers of the State ? The Liberal party believed
that the best solution of the labor difficulty was to widen
the opportunities of labor, so that men could get employ-
ment upon that which was most productive of wealth
until at last a man would become his own employer, de-
voting his labor to the land, and having the fruit of his
labor to himself. (Applause.)
Well, Joey Carruthers and the other great tinkers
of his party were quite a long while in power, and
Joey himself was the great slinker in charge of the
Lands Department; and yet it is impossible to be
a blinker of the fact that the Golden Age did not
materialise.
HIS FIRST VISIT TO THE COUNTRY.
"Heigh! Heigh! Billy, where? re you off to?"
“ Come on, quick I Uncle David sez the horse
down here is eating his head off.”
When Conroy brayed forth his disastrous
yarn about Socialists and free love the Free-
traders trembled with one simultaneous quiver
that shook the building. Remarkable stories drift
round concerning some of the Freetraders.
Conroy’s action was heartily condemned by his
own party, which fully expected to see some
Laborite rise and inquire if, because lived
in a state of bigamy with two sisters, the great
Freetrade Party advocated the demoralisation of
sisters-in-law in general. But no one did. One
member merely observed that, though some of the
Freetrade party not only believed in bigamy but
also practised it, the Laborites didn’t charge the
party with believing in bigamy as a general thing.

CONSUMPTION
NIPPED IN THE BUD BY
VITADATIO
Brunswick, 10 Eveline-street,
Off Glenlyon Road.
Dear Sir, —My son, who is now fourteen years of age,
has been very ill off and on since he was four years, and
about three years ago he was so ill that the doctor told
me he was developing consumption. He had a terrible
couch, which was distressing to listen to ; he had fallen
away to almost a skeleton. At this time Mr. Luxton,
Sydney Road, Cobury, advised me to try VITADATIO,
which I did. After the first bottle I saw a great improve-
ment. I continued the medicine ; he gradually improved
until he became quite well. I consider VITADATIO a
wonderful medicine, as it has made a different boy of my
son, who I never expected to see healthy again. I can
recommend it to anyone, and will be glad to give any in-
formation to anyone suffering from the same complaint.—l
remain,
EMILY MACKEY.
Sydney Road, Coburg.
I hereby certify to the above. I have known the boy
for four years, during which time he was in very bad
health. I advised his mother to give VITADATIO a trial,
with the above results.
Yours faithfully,

Malthoid Roofing
Is just as permanent in character of material as slate or tile or even
lead. It is made of wool felt saturated with a certain substance which
is absolutely waterproof, and coated on the top of that with
a non-oxidizing substance which makes it absolutely weatherproof.
Two pretty good qualifications for a roofing— waterproof and
weatherproof. What else do tiles, slates or lead possess? This
—they are costly and often break and let through the wet.
This cannot happen to P & B Malthoid Roofing, which is cheap,
and pliable, soft, strong, easy to lay, and everlasting in wear.
You would do well if you sent for a Booklet, and probably save
money, worry and expense. Who knows ?

For a Hebrew maiden, Miss Isaura
Aokman, who lately suicided by drowning, was
a phenomenally advanced woman. She was
reared in luxury, and received a liberal education.
Afterwards she lived for some years amidst
artistic surroundings at Florence, with a cousin
who had made a reputation as a sculptress. On
her return to Melbourne the intellectual woman
beci ne a member of the Austral Salon, and
start jd lecturing on philosophical subjects, which
fell rather flat. Her philosophy was not appre-
ciated, and she took too much to heart her failure
to shine as an intellectual leader.
“Melb.” : I was gazing from the re-
porters’ gallery on Thursday night upon a melan-
choly lone figure sitting at the, corner of the
Opposition bench. There he remained musing for
an hour at a time, like Bonaparte at St. Helena.
Could this be the gay, the light and airy, the pro-
fusely conversational Austin Chapman, who used to
dance round the Chamber like a frivolous nothing
or a ball of fluff off the top of a dandeli n, in the
days when he was whip ? Chappie was plainly
thinking to himself “ What chance have I of being
in the next little lot.” Well, he had a good time,
and what can man ask for more ? But he looks
2cwt. heavier since his fall.

“ Jimmy S.” is impressed by the reverend
gentleman’s skirt and petticoat:—
The parson had been preaching- 13 year?, and should
soon be finished now, I thought. ’Twas my birthday. A
man should have birthdays and go to church occasionally.
Heard something about sevej gates being on the East,
and 19 defunct caterpillars the West, and Milldacky
biting the Pope’s toe on the South, and Zion Howie’s
whiskers burning in the North. The congregation seemed
about to rise and call the minister blessed. I looked at the
congregation, at the minister, and the choir, and then at
Deuteronomy xxii., 5 : “The woman shall not wear that
which pertaineth to a man, neither shall a man put on a
woman’s garment, for all that do so are abomination
unto the Lord.”
“T.S.”: This is the latest from the ex-
clusive suburb of East Melbourne : Some little
time before midnight, on my way home a motor-
car came tearing round the corner from Clarendon-
street into Albert-street. This car seemed to be
at once followed by two persons running on the
footpath—the woman, hatless and swearing, natu-
rally enough being in the rear. The agonised
female was screaming out “Stop ! Stop ! Police !
Police ! ” A weedy youth on the corner ejaculated
“Bli’me! I’m off for the police ! ” A man came
out from the front door of a neighboring house and
called out, asking me what the noise was about.
“Dunno,” said I, “but I believe someone has
stolen a motor-car.” By this time the motor was
disappearing over the top of the hill. The afore-
said agonised female had ceased screaming and
she and her companion were standing on the foot-
path. “ Let’s see if we can do anything for these
people,” said the inquiring householder, and we
crossed the road towards the distressed ones.
“It’s all right. It’s only me in a jealous fit.”
We gazed on her. “Don’t you even know those
people in the motor-car?” I asked dazedly.
“No,” she said, quite surprised; “I never saw
them in my life.” Then we went away too full
for utterance and wondered at the unaccountable-
ness of hatless women

Doderyism in Vandemonia.
A few weeks ago the old-time Vandemonians, who
are becoming a small and feeble folk, suffered a
severe shock in the sweeping defeat of Adye
Douglas, who offered himself for re-election to
the House of Dodery’ for the seat of Launceston.
For years Douglas had been giving picturesque
and striking proof of his utter unfitness to hold
responsible office in a legislative chamber. He
has been in the habit of joining in debate, some-
times insultingly enough, from his President’s
seat, and doing man v other curious things. In
short, Adye, while being to his own satisfaction
a law unto himself, has been a considerable scandal
in a community which is almost persuaded to be-
come progressive ; for Launceston is really a pro-
gressive town when its prejudices are not roused.
But the curse of Doderyism in Vandemonia is not
dead, and Dodery himself is President of the
Upper House now. Now William Dodery is an
amiable old gentleman, and when he dies the
irreverent democracy—which is rather apt to
ignore symbols and portents and causes that work
secretly to direful ends—will probably remember
him for a month as a harmless old cuss. There is
no political form or comeliness in William
Dodery, that any live man or woman should
desire him. As a, legislator, he toils not neither
does he spin, being chiefly concerned in fraying
the weft and woof that stronger hands have
woven; but not Solomon in all his glory had a
better opinion of himself. The House of Dodery
is a decorative institution gone bald and palsied—a
sort of decrepit legislative gaud. The Assembly
builds, and the House of Dodery destroys . . .
blessed be gaud ! They sit there, these dismal
Doderyites, querulously at war with a bold, bad
world that has got some centuries ahead of them
they sit and blink in the light like mouldy old
moths. As moths, they neither preserve nor con-
struct ; their mission is to destroy. No one pre-
tends that they possess any special intelligence, or
any informing sense of legislative decency. In the
fiercest heat of their debates they only mumble,
slavering in their pathetic senility, deeming that
fpublic may be daunted by the clash of their
teeth, though nothing can be heard but the
oozy squidge of their gums. Intelligence is
not required of them, nor shrewdness, nor
patriotism, nor any generous merit. They
are unfit survivals of that medievalism which
is rotting as it dies. They have no faiths, nor
any fair ideal. On their most firm beliefs, all
thinkers of the wider world have been spitting in
derision for half a century; but the wider world
they wot not of nor see. For them the very uni-
verse of God is Vandemonia, and they would
s £ ol ujr consent to the destruction of Hesperus and
the hosts of Heaven than put another halfpenny
on the land-tax. They are elected on a shamefully
narrow franchise, or they could not live in politics
a day. They were left high and dry by the re-
ceding tides of convictism, as uninteresting and
useless a row of fossils as ever justified a curse in
all the wide Australias. They represent the Vote
Greed. Their whole purpose in life is to see
that the bulk of the taxes are paid by the poorest
class, and that the sweater and the monopolist
and the land-shark and the scab are tenderly
shielded from every wind of Heaven. Aus-
tralians have their Legislative Councils—bad
enough in some instances; but the Legislative
Council of Vandemonia is a gross offence that
stinks to heaven and shames the blessed sun, and
no untravelled mainlander can appreciate or realise
it. But William Dodery, its prophet, has be-
come its President, and is only 85 years old ; and
the people are therefore going to pay William a
larger salary than heretofore for spoiling law and
sweeping back the sea. Jubilate! Meantime the
democracy grows stronger and feels its strength,
even in Tasmania. _ And the democracy begins to
recognise the conspicuous fact that, in Tasmania,
with its less than 200,000 people, the stupidly ob-
structive House of Dodery is a luxury that can be
done without. So that, sooner or later, the awful
institution will be flung forth. It will crumble in
corruption as it falls, and all men will marvel at
the stench thereof.
The Fat Man’s Socialism.
“ T.H.” traces Socialism to its lair and finds the
beast at home :
Desiring to get some evidence of the awful evils of
socialistic legislation, I made a careful search of Mel-
bourne Argus of Friday, May 13. Not counting any
references to the subject in the heavy columns of
reports of political speeches in which Premier Bent was
advocating measures for the prevention of the adul-
teration of foods, drinks, fabrics, manures, etc., and
Minister Swinburne was urging the expenditure of
millions on additional waterworks, I made out the
following list. An article advocating the extension of the
Dookie Agricultural College work run by the State;
an article describing an experiment in the expor-
tation of onions, made by the State Agricultural
Department ; a promise by Minister Cameron
of assistance to the Maffra Shire Council in
the construction of roads and bridges; a long list of
Government and Metropolitan Board of Works accepted
contracts ; a request from Caulfield Shire Council for
further police protection ; control of motor traffic by the
same council; promises by Bent of financial assistance to
Carrum Swamp settlers, in connection with flood damages;
a request to the S.A. Government to control the inflow of
salt water at the mouth of the Murray Diver ; a request
to the Tasmanian Government to open up a new port at
Kelso Bay; an experiment by the same Government in ship-
ment of produce to Manila ; Maoriland Government order
for plant for sterilising bone-dust; Victorian Government
urged to build new central railway station ; Victorian
Government requested to make improvements to railway
pier and yard at Geelong; a request of the Warragul
shire for grant of £5OO for roads and bridges ; a request
to the Victorian Railway Commissioners for additional
railway to Mornington Peninsula ; Victorian Government
asked to increase facilities for delivery of Sydney mails in
Melbourne ; Government weather forecast, synopsis and
river gaugings ; Government urged to establish a colony
for epileptics; a request from the Drysdale shire
council to Government not to reduce municipal subsidy;
Drouin Fruitgrowers’ Association’s invitation to Govern-
mentlpoultry expert to lecture before its members ; request
for erection of a new post-office and telegraph office at
Korumburra; new school asked for at Moe : intimation
that Sunbury shire council was fixing weight-limits for
certain bridges. In addition to these items I found quite
a host of cases where the State was interfering with pri-
vate enterprise, or assisting private enterprise, through
the agency of the police and the law courts. There were
about 200 cases of probate having been granted to wills
half-a-dozen insolvency cases settled, two divorce cases’
five Supreme Court cases, two important maintenance
cases, the winding up of the Premier Permanent Building
and Land Investment Association, 16 police-court cases
the search (at public expense) for a missing grazier, and
the execution (at public expense) of Horton for wife
ln -Adelaide. It is wonderful what a small portion
of the news of the Argus of that day had any reference to
the great god Private Enterprise, or his worship.
Our Friend, the Birthrate.
Melbourne Age recently published these solemn
truths about the poor old birth-rate and the callous
employer who does his best to abolish it
It is nothing'short of pathetic to see the “helpmeet”
principle dying- at the hands of employers. Nothing
shows the attitude of these individuals more strongly than
the use of the word encumbrance. “No encumbrance”
means no wife or child, and surely when it comes to
calling-what ought to be a man’s most honored possession
by such a name as this, public opinion might well rouse
itself to effect an alteration in the conditions ruling the
destinies of our young men and women.
While this sentencing of young men to celibacy in towns
I? snough, it is actually worse in the country. The
bachelor managers, overseers, bookkeepers, and “hands”
on the big 1 stations alone would make a most presentable
army of young men. Of course, the squatter might well
stand aghast at the vision of this army, each blessed with
a wife and family, being maintained on the individual
stations. Here, again, the question may be asked, What
right has the squatter to interfere ? So long as the man
he employs works to his satisfaction, why should he con-
cern himself about his responsibilities ? It is the man
himself who has to support them. If his work is worse
done than it would be by a single man, then, and then
only, should he be made to suffer. The same thing
applies to farms, factories, banks, and every other kind of
country institutions employing men. If the wages of the
individual justify him in marrying, his taking unto him-
self a wife should be left to his own discretion. Time was
when various concessions were made, especially on
stations, to married men. That day has gone by, and n@
rational worker nowadays expects the squatter, the com-
pany or the management to adopt a philanthropic attitude
towards his family.
These bachelor forces in the country are well worth
studying. The further north one goes the more marked
become their characteristics. Murray townships and
scores of towns in New South Wales and Queensland can
gather to themselves at a day’s notice as fine a lot of
possible husbands as any settlements anywhere. If anv
one of these bachelors marries he is safe to be regarded
a « sotted. ” He is settled in this way, that his chances
of bettering himself are practically shattered. If he
happens to he in a bank, the chances are he will find him-
self unemployed before he is much older. If he occupies
a good position on a station the most he can hope for is to
be left to occupy it in peace. If he leaves it he will find
himself doing what hundreds of others have done before
him wandering from one possible employer to another to
be met everlastingly with the assurance that single men
suit them better than married ones. To see, as hundreds of
them have seen, genial, light-hearted young men drifting
into lonely middle age, cynical attitudes and regrettable
habits is sufficient to give one pause. The bachelor is
rarely a success—the spinster has a hundred advantages
over him—and this wholesale manufacturing of an un-
desirable commodity is a really deplorable circumstance.

“J.E.W.” writes from Perth about the cheerful
immunity enjoyed by the Sandgroping homicide
Murderers have a good time in Westralia. The Dago-
land criminal law has it that there are three kinds of
homicide for which a man may be scragged, but juries
and executives have such an astonishing way of getting
round the law that, though killings are moderately fre-
quent, white men are rarely or never hanged—only black
and brown aliens. Recently transpired that nor’-west
squatter Anderson, sentenced to life imprisonment for
helping to flog three blacks to death in 1897, was released
on ticket-of-leave more than a year ago. Anderson’s was
a peculiarly horrible case, and ex-Ohief Justice Onslow,
who sat on the Bench, badly wanted to hang him, but was
blocked by a lenient jury. The murderer is related to
certain well-known Westralian families, so tongues have
been wagging hard. The worst facts about the business
are that the notice of Anderson’s release wasn’t gazetted
as is usual, and that he hasn’t been made to conform
to the ordinary ticket-of-leave regulations. In fact, the
whole thing was kept a close official secret. But
Anderson’s isn’t the worst case Westralia has seen. There
is a man at large in the country who got seven years for
killing his wife (he sawed the body into small pieces after
death), and served three. In two other cases of homicide,
or rather plain, deliberate murder, the accused were
acquitted by complaisant juries, although well known by
the whole community (one’s guilt was self-confessed) to
be guilty. During three years or so past there have been
four cases of self-confessed man-slaying on the fields,
which resulted in one accused being sentenced to 18
months, another to 12, while the other two were
acquitted. Three of the four were arraigned for murder.
J ustice is a peculiar animal in Westralia.

The “Australian Social Reform League’s”
conference in Sydney was mostly to discuss
tne birth-rate question. The league carefully
drafted a programme, avoiding, of course, the
kernel of the trouble—so far as there is
any trouble. Therefore, though “ the more effec-
tive , suppression of indecent pictures and litera-
ture” has a place (though Heaven knows how that
is going to be dragged into the empty cradle),
there isn’t a word about the encouragement of
Australian industry, which would allow the Aus-
tralian workman to look with some confidence to
being able to find a billet for his youngster
if he had one. The conference is to discuss
“ the need of an industrial farm to train boys
in agriculture, and thus give them an inclina-
tion _to settle on the land ” ; but its silence con-
cerning the means of supplying good accessible land
to settle the boys on is tremendous. Presumably
it thinks that there is land somewhere at the back
of Bourke, and that once the boys get there the
birth-rate will boom. The “Social Reform
League ” seems to consist pretty largely of par-
son ; and the average parson has a simply superb
nose for “illegal instruments,” and “quackery,”
and “indecent pictures and literature,” and an
equally superb capacity for dodging the toes of
the fat people in the front pews. Yet, so far as
there is a birth-rate trouble, it is those persons in
the front pews that are mostly responsible for it.

A letter from Chow Africa
Don’t be surprised if there is a revolution in South
Africa before many months. Poverty throughout the
land, is unparalleled. The bottom has fallen out of busi-
ness, and cash is an unknown quantity. Meanwhile,
foodstuffs were never dearer. White men who have the
fare are clearing out fast, and the fellows who cannot
get out of the Gehenna are ready for the word “ rise ! ”
Milner has made an amazing mess of things. He hasn’t
the administrative capacity of a Paddy’s market manager,
and he has surrounded himself with a bevy of silly im-
ported johnnies who should not trust themselves outside
a private bar without a lady escort. The Britisher
on the spot has been bankrupted in the midst
of the richest auriferous and diamondiferous areas in
the world, and he has realised the reason why, and
means mischief. The Boers are keeping' ominously quiet,
and just as the British didn’t succeed in disarming the
Kaffirs, so they didn’t disarm the Boers. It is a matter of
notoriety that the Boers have more than enough rifles to
go round, and that, should responsible Government be too
long deferred, they will attempt a coup d’etat. It is a moral
certainty that if they rose simultaneously it would require
another £200,000,000 to fix up a second peace of Vereenig-
ing. The British taxpayer is hardly ready to foot such a bill.
It may be said that the Boers will honorably keep the
compact, but that compact has already been broken by
Britain in spirit and in letter. The leakage of £1,500,000
of the £3,000,000 ag'reed to be paid for repatriation, and
the Chinese ordinance constitute violations of the treaty
of peace, and absolve the Boers of any moral obligation to
keep faith with the faithless. I am thoroughly in touch
with Boer feeling and sentiment, and have no reason to
discredit the rumors of a skilfully-planned scheme of re-
volution—and a bloodless revolution at that, for British
disaffection plays into the hands of the Boers. The thing
that may avert a rising is the prompt appearance of a
Liberal administration, and the departure of that exploded
bubble, Milner.
Apparently there will be no dissolution in
Tasmania on any matter of lofty principle while
Propsting is Premier. Evidences multiply that
Proppy intends to stick to office even if he can’t
stick to his opinions. Before he came to power
he was valorous and determined, and many people
had high hopes of him ; but he is very meek and
vacillating now, and few there be that have any
word to say in his defence. His opinions become
daily more “ moderate,” his democracy is decorous
(if not dubious) in the extreme. The man who
was is dead, and this is a new and quite superiah
person. The wretched itch of sassiety is in his
blood; he sees himself already Sir Bispham
Propsting. He has lost all his grit, and half his
gumption, and his attitude towards the insensate
House of Dodery is now an extra subdued sort of
Christian resignation.


Brain Food.
Not long since there was a great run on the fish
markets, because it was announced that fish was
b
food for the brain. Of
course'the fallacy of the
fad was soon exploded.
Normally, the food we
eat nourishes brain,
nerves, muscle, bones,
etc., each part of the
body assimilating
phosphorous salts, lime,
according to its need.
When the brain begins
to show weakness, or
the nerves become sen-
sitive, it is a sign that
there is a loss of the
nutrition contained in
the food eaten, and this
loss is, in general, due
to disease of the
stomach, and its allied
organs. Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills aid
the digestion and
assimilation of food. It
is not the quantity of
food eaten, but the
amount of nourishment
which is retained that
benefits the system. If from any cause the
nourishment in the food is not extracted the whole
body suffers. Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, by
keeping the liver and kidneys active, the stomach
clean, and the blood pure, tone the entire system.
They are a positive and permanent cure for all
diseases arising from a disordered stomach, liver
and kidneys, and are an infallible remedy for
constipation, biliousness, sick headaches, piles,
pimples, boils, skin diseases and female ailments.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The “ outer ” of a Sydney racecourse is that spot
outside the fence where assemble impecunious but ardent
sports, and the exiled riff-raff of the sporting community.
It has its ring of “ bookmakers,” and by a system of
“ tick-tacking,” or signalling, the little circle keeps
cognisant of all the proceedings inside. The wagering is
interesting. You can see 2to 1 about a horse accepted
in empty beer-bottles, or a punter taking eighteenpence
against his pocket-knife and tobacco. But in most cases
the business is done in cash —the value of the “books”
made being anything from a shilling to £5.

“ F.” : The Australian horse has had its praises
sung by the “authorities,” military and otherwise, in
India, S’Africa, and Japan. It is sa-d to show exceptional
powers of endurance in a foreign climate ; to be, in short,
the most desirable of horses everywhere. This country
talks more about Horse than any other country, but none
of its six Governments has thusfar proposed to establish
a system of stud farms for breeding the noble animal. In
Westralia a lot of breeding is effected on Crown lands,
though not under proper supervision, for the steed multi-
plies in a wild state and unconsciously reproves the
Government for not developing the valuable natural re-
sources of the country.

South Australian turfdom is much exercised
over the big drop in tote operations evidenced at
S.A. J.C. Autumn meet. These are the figures :
1899.. .. £45,178 1902.. .. £42,179
1900.. .. 40,132 1903 .. .. 38,388
1901 .. .. 30,491 1904 .. .. 29,383
Chief cause of the trouble is that Mo is increasing and
multiplying fast and, as he doesn’t pay a license, race
promoters get nothing out of him to make up for the
diminished tote yield caused by his ever increasing
presence. Neither police nor clubs care to move against
him in the matter owing to previous sets-back. Remedy
is, give clubs the power to levy taxes from Ikey or intro-
duce a provision that will wipe him off the S. A. betting
earth completely. Otherwise horse racing in Crow-eater
State will peter away to something very small indeed.

Gladsome case is still matter for much press
comment and discussion in M.L. sporting resorts. Many
leading lawyers opine that decision of appeal judges of
M.L. racing conference is not justified, in equity or law,
by the rules of racing. Plain English of the rules is that
only when they knowingly employ an unlicensed jockey
are owners liable. Fact of tiiis being- so clearly set out
demonstrates that it was never intended the penalty
should be inflicted upon an owner in Mr. J. B. Reid’s
position. Everyone is satisfied—turf rulers and the
public generally—that he was unaware the apprentice
had not the necessary license —never gave the matter a
thought, in fact, because Jones had been doing so much
riding without objection being raised.

Prize money given away at latest Q.T.C. meet
totalled £2825, and 31 owners participated—probably a
record distribution. Biggest scoops were—J. McGill
£865, W. J. Tucker £330, and L. A. Cooper £240. Most
successful jockeys engaged were—A. Scott, E. Best, and
W. H. Smith, three wins each ; and Grafton headed the
list of winning sires with a trio of successes through Fitz-
Grafton (twice) and Truce.

Died recently, at Wanganui (M.L.), George
Elliott, for years identified with the publication of the
Maoriland Stud Book, brought into existence and nur-
tured by his dad before him. Elliott pere arrived in Nel-
son 64 years ago, and established the Nelson Examiner.
He died 30 years ago. The Stud Book was produced
at considerable loss, and had not Elliott, junr. , been an
out-and-out enthusiast, this work—one of national turf
importance—would probably have been dropped alto-
gether. Maoriland Racing- Conference took the Stud Book
over before George Elliott’s death.

On appearances (as far as character and size are
concerned) Truce is more of a Derby colt than his-elder
brother (Queensland’s champion, Fitz-Grafton), but latter
is shapely and a proven great galloper and stayer, which
is considerably more to the point than good looks. Lots
of racing men who saw Fitz-Grafton perform at the recent
Queensland meeting rate him at least the equal of Mel-
bourne and Sydney Cups’ winner, Lord Cardigan. Fitz-
Grafton’s quality is unquestionably high above that of
every horse his age (3yrs.) that has annexed a two-mile
race in Queensland. Years gone have seen several 3-year-
olds appropriate Queensland and Brisbane Cups, but none
showed anything like as well as this first foal from the
Buckthorpe mare, Olive Branch.

Steeplechase on first day (Saturday) of A. J.C.’s
Prince of Wales Birthday meeting was the best seen at
Randwick for years. Nine stripped, and generally fenced
in excellent style. Most money came for South Coast
performers Driscoll and Grafter, former lining up slightly
the better favorite. Of others, Skylark and Coal King
had best support. Coal King, after showing well in front
for a while, came a cropper, and the next set—the palings
—saw Sateen bump the ground hard. Skylark held the
lead till nearing the final obstacle, when Driscoll headed
and beat him easily.

First day of A. J.C. meeting provided another
staggering- instance of how nags dodge punters and play
into the hands of Mo. Backed heavily at Rosehill a week
previously, in a field of four, Florine ran a bad last. On
Saturday, in the Novice Handicap, when she was the least
fancied of a big field (20’s being freely offered), without a
cent of stable-money on her, the mare, in an interesting-
finish, snatched victory on the post, with another abso-
lutely unlucky one, The Irish Horse (imp.), barely a head
away, second. Even-money favorite Margaros cut out the
work for seven furlongs, but wasn’t within a long distance
of the winner at the end. Another unusually heavy knock
for backers same day was the Ellesmere Handicap, which
went to rank outsider Praleen, with favorite, The Relic,
second.

Adelaide’s Birthday meeting got through its
second section, or final half, or something, last Saturday
and Monday. On Saturday the chief event was the
Birthday Cup, a mile-and-a-half gamble. Seaport
(7st. 71b.) carried most of the public favor and £6lt ss.
of the £3ooBinvested on the race. Bright Pilgrim came
next with £597 15s. Antilles, the winner, carried only
£lB9 10s., while Combat, the third placed, had £245.
Twelve started. Antilles, who w'as carrying a ten
pounds penalty, sw-ept through the field all in
a hundred yards, and at the mile from home was
only a couple of lengths behind Rifler. Bright Pilgrim
had fallen away to second last. At the sfur. Antilles shot
past Rifler who fell back to sixth place. Combat
streaked up, and when Antilles entered the straight was
only three paces away ; then Seaport flashed out, but the
Carlyon-Queen of Nations mare w'as never bustled, and
finished three lengths ahead of Seaport, with Combat
third. Dividends, £lO 14s. and 225. On Monday 11
started for the Alderman Cup, for which Seaport w-as
favorite. Rifler was withdrawn. Avalon finished a length
and a half to the good, with Bright Pilgrim the same dis-
tance behind Discussion. Tote showed £2547 invested,
and paid £8 2s. and 375.

V.R.C. Birthday meeting (Monday) saw Sweep
Clean run the best race of his life in winning Birthday
Handicap. During past three weeks the colt, in eight
races, has w'on four and been second on a similar number
of occasions. Princess May Handicap, for two-year-olds,
was responsible for a nasty accident. Near the finish
Kamimura fell, apparently through striking Langraf’s
hindleg. Kamimura’s rider, Curtain, was thrown over
his mount’s head and sustained concussion of the brain.
Most promising of Victorian jumpers (MuGuinness) toppled
over the last fence in the Steeplechase and broke his
neck ; he only had to stand up to w-in.

Looks as if matters lepping (hitherto very much
off) are going to brighten up in Sydney, for second ’Chase
(Monday) of A. J.O. meeting proved every bit as interest-
ing as Saturday’s event and a genuine treat. Driscoll won
again—this time humping the steadier of 11.6 and doing
it like a thorough top-notcher. Skylark gave a capital
display of fencing and finished second once more. Six
stripped, and there were no falls.

Biggest winner at A.J.C. two days meet was
Mr. T. Driscoll, owner of ’chaser Driscoll—his cheque was
£3Bl. The ltelic’s second on Saturday and first on Mon-
day brought Mr. T. Brown £3OB, and Mr. J. Samuels,
owner of Eegio who gathered Princess May Stakes, came
in for £2OS.

Though Mo. had a heap the better of punters
on first day of A. J.O. meeting, they got more than even
with him Monday, when first favorites scored in every
race. But betting generally was close, so that the bags
probably always held enough to pay out without their
owners being driven to the heart-breaking necessity of
drawing upon reserves.

How race club profits come. During its
recently closed financial year Canterbury J.O. (M.L.)
gathered £14,435 through the tote and paid the Govern-
ment £2256 as tax. It gave away £20,250 in prize
money, but entry fees, etc., brought nearly £5OOO back.

Te Aute College men gave an exhibition of
gentlemanly football at Sydney Cricket Ground on Satur-
day, when they ran over St. Joseph’s College team in a
pleasant, by-your-leave, well-bred manner. They were a
fine, handsome set of boys, but it is doubtful if in all
Sydney’s first-grade Rugby there were any heavier backs,
and it looked a most unequal match between them and
the spry little fellows from Sti Joseph’s. It took two and
three of the little ones to stop a Maori back when he
got properly going, and against such superior weight the
St. Joseph lads made a very creditable display. The for-
wards especially played a brilliant game, which com-
pletely outclassed that of their much-vaunted, colored
brethren. The Maori tendency to get offside on
every possible occasion was as marked as ever, and
earned penalty kicks every few minutes. The
rapidity with which the Maori winger and backs got
down on the leather prevented St. Joseph’s backs
turning to any account the excellent heeling of their
forwards in the scrums. The Maori running was
picturesque and tricky, but their passing was only fair,
while their picking up was deplorable. They were evi-
dently still suffering from the effects of the voyage over,
when some of them are understood to have been rent in
twain and doubled right up. Against a team like the
University, Saturday’s crowd would have made a very
poor showing, but by the time that match eventuates the
Te Autes will have recovered their form. As it was, they
had a match that suited their racial temperament exactly,
wherein a physically inferior team struggled gamely and
put up a sufficiently strong resistance to take away the
appearance of a rug-over. It looks magnificent to
see a towering figure in a red and black jersey, his face
of rich brown wreathed in smiles, ploughing through a
host of small boys, knocking them right and left, and
dragging them after him, but it isn’t a fair match. It
was not until a few minutes before the end that the St.
Joseph’s succeeded in dribbling the ball across the line
and falling on it. The game concluded in favor of Te
Aute by 23 to 3 ; the Maoris doing a triumphant haka as
they came off the field. They won’t feel so fresh the
afternoon they play University—the only team anywhere
near their own weight.
* * * ♦
“ Canny ” : Reading about visit of the Te Aute
College footballers to Australia reminds me of something.
I once refereed in a Maori football match at which no man
wore boots. After the first big scrum one player emerged
with the calf of his leg in his hand, and remarked :
“Look here, Mr. Referee, I think that the next time
Henare play the pushball he cut his plurry toe-nail.” But
I suppose this sort of question isn’t likely to arise with
the Te Aute men.

Football as an aid to the detection of criminals
is strongly believed in by the Sydney force. Gangs that
can hide underground six days of the week in defiance of
all other temptations, voluntarily crawl out on Saturday
afternoon when a big game is announced. They are
watchful at the start, but as the game quickens they
warm up and forget themselves, and call each other by
their real names quite recklessly.
* * * *
This season’s Victorian football already begins
to assume many of the unpleasant characteristics of for-
mer years. Saturday before last saw previous year’s
placed clubs—’Wood, ’Roy and Carlton—level, with three
wins and one defeat each. Carlton lost to ’Roy ; ’Roy
was walloped handily by ’Wood,“and ’Wood unaccountably
went under to “Sowth.” It was this latter result that
caused the talk, Collingwood being undoubtedly the
better team. Tote-man Wren is generally understood to
finance ’Wood, while Caterer Skinner is credited with per-
forming a similar kind office for “Sowth.” Fitzroy had
made a holy show of Melbourne, which ’Wood could only
barely defeat; then latter went under badly to “ Sowth,”
and, of course, the odds against them for the Fitzroy
match lengthened. Latter was a fine, fast, open game,
and though there were 25,000 excited people on the
ground, it was an orderly crowd that didn’t lose its tem-
per, like the pushes that swarmed to watch Richmond
beat North Melbourne, in the Association. The barrackers
of these semi-senior clubs are. less seasoned than the
League followers, and fights were frequent. Towards
half-time, a slice of the picket fence round the playing
area gave way, and while five mounted troopers chased
the spectators away from the players, other excitable
onlookers were using the pickets as waddies. Half-a-
dozen were subsequently escorted to the lock-up to
cool off.

Sydney first grade Rugby drew 10,000 spectators
on Saturday, although only three matches were played,
Balmain having gone on strike and forfeited to North
Sydney. University’s fast passing rushes demoralised the
Western Suburbs men, who, except for a few good
dribbling rushes, played a defensive game. Uni. won by
16 to 7. At the University Oval, Newtown defeated Glebe
by Bto nil. It might have been more but for the New-
town backs indulging in the ridiculous habit of racing
right across the field. Newtown’s kicking was wretched,
and one of the team was sent off the field for letting a
.hasty and grimy right fall on the countenance of a Glebe
back. South Sydney and Eastern Suburbs seemed
about equal in mediocrity, although South Sydney
was handicapped early in the game by having
a man sent off the field for illegal tackling.
The contest was only interesting in spots, and ended
in a draw, with three points each. Burley and Quinsey,
South Sydney’s three-quarters, showed a proper apprecia-
tion of opportunities by trying to pot goals. They failed
but that did not detract from the wisdom of the effort.
Monday’s round ended with University still un-
beaten, that team having won all the six matches played.
North Sydney is next, with four wins, one defeat, and one
draw. Then Newtown, with four wins and two defeats.
Western Suburbs so far has not succeeded in winning a
match, but pleads for recognition with a couple of
draws. Balmain, which has won one match and
lost five (including the two forfeited), is quite
proud in comparison, although in points Western
Suburbs’ two draws count as much as Balmain’s
solitary victory, and leaves them both with two points to
credit. South Sydney has lost two, won three, and drawn
one ; Eastern Suburbs show one win, four defeats, and one
draw. Glebe, through Balmain’s forfeit, has won two,
lost three, and drawn one. But there’s plenty of time yet
for any club to come to the front.
Balmain’s strike is the joke of the season. Three
of the Balmainiacs insulted the Rugby Union committee
last season, and the Union dealt out sudden death. Two
apologised and were resurrected, while the third,
Hutcheson, considered he was too dead to apologise, and
the Union declares he shall remain defunct till he does.
Then his club demanded his resurrection, and threatened
to commit the happy despatch by withdrawing from the
first grade competition unless the demand was acceded
to. It wasn’t, and the team forfeited to North Sydney
and Glebe. So far Balmain has not been such a vast
success that it will be seriously missed from the competi-
tion if it decides to make a fool of itself.
Another round of first-grade Rugby was played
off in Sydney on Monday, but apparently the strain of
rejoicing- over a certain small birthday had affected the
nerves of the ’bailers, and play generally was not up to
Saturday’s standard. Twelve thousand people were at
the Agricultural Ground to watch the struggle between
University and Eastern Suburbs. Eastern Suburbs were
the premiers last year, and the Uni. is the leader in this
season’s competition so far. University started with a
tremendous rush, and in two minutes had scored a try
which Verge converted. Then the effects of “loyalty”
began to show, and although there were spasmodic flashes
afterwards, there was nothing with a sheen on it.
Eastern Suburbs would undoubtedly have won the match
but for their erratic passing, if such a wild fashion
of heaving the ball anywhere when threatened can
be called passing—as often as not it was thrown
on the ground nearer to a University than an E.S. man.
The game ended without any further score being made by
either side. At the Oval, Newtown and Western Suburbs
both showed a fine lack of head work, and flung the
leather away promiscuously. Both teams kicked deplor-
ably, and a rushing, racing tussle ended in a win for
Newtown by 6to 3. The best match of the day was
that between North and South Sydney at the Sports
Ground. One of the fastest and most vigorous games
of the season came to an end with an extra brilliant
passing rush, which resulted in a goal, leaving South Syd-
ney victorious by 11 points to North’s four.

Maoriland’s record football match was played at
Wanganui on Saturday. At Wanganui the gentle tough
got loose, and, in proportion to numbers engaged, Om-
durman and Nan Shan were not in it for bloodshed. One
player was kicked in the stomach, and promptly sent to
hospital ; a whole pack fell on another and kicked him on
the head, cut him over the eye, broke bis collarbone, and
left him stunned ; a third had his hand broken ; and a
number of others received “minor injuries,” which pro-
bably means that they were wrecked. There have been
loud complaints about rough football all over Maoriland
lately, but this is the culmination.

Just before his departure for the great pork-
and-beans republic Major Taylor announced that he would
not go to either France or England, and the World’s
Championships would be run off without him. As he is
likely to be back in Australia in November he will, he
says, rest till then. Meanwhile he is beginning to have
doubts if ’Murka is God’s own country. He has acquired
such a liking for Australia that he took away a small
menagerie of ’possums, young wallabies, and a bandicoot
or two to keep its memory green. He was anxious to
secure a bunyip and a platypus, but failed. He reckons
that a bunyip would shake up even the blas6 Yankees.

The position of the £750, Sydney Thousand
first prize, now is that the Summer Nights Amusement
Ltd. has paid the amount into the court, and left O’Brien
and Corbett to fight for it. None of the lawyers who are
appearing in the case took part in the race, but they are
going to get a fair share of the prize-money all the same.

Melbourne has also got a cycling case in the
courts. The promoters of the matches between Taylor
and Ivor Lawson lodged £75 stake-money with the Leag-ue
of Wheelmen. Owing to Lawson being disqualified for
having bumped Major Taylor, the match was not con-
cluded, and neither Taylor nor Lawson got the money,
which in such cases generally goes to the controlling
body. The promoters don’t see why it should and are
suing the League of Wheelmen for a refund.

Members of the Melbourne Bicycle Club just
now have a decent-sized quarrel on hand. It seems that
a number of members found it difficult to get certain
financial information which they badly wanted. They
moved to get it in the annual balance-sheet. After some
twistings the committee agreed to issue an amended
balance sheet. This showed several important things;
among them that a fair percentage had not been
deducted for depreciation of furniture and fixings, and
that a scoring-board that was admittedly worthless had
been put down as an asset worth £B2. Then the office-
bearers for the current year were elected in a hole and
corner sort of fashion to which strong objection was taken
by the disaffected members. First the committee refused
to hold another election ; then it climbed down. In
addition a member has given notice of motion to appoint
a select committee to dredge up the finances of the
institution, there being an impression that a very little
dredging will bring further grievances to the surface.

South Australian League delegates at the
Federal Cycling Council meeting in Melbourne launched
a proposal that in future the Australian leagues should
co-operate and import over-sea riders instead of
leaving the matter to sports promoters. The idea
deserved a better fate than being heaved under the table.
The only objection to the innovation appeared to be that
a company had hitherto brought out the “ stars ” and
made an alleged good profit out of the transaction, and
the leagues couldn’t be bothered over the matter.
Cycling bodies in Australia have for a long time set up an
awful howl that the pastime isn’t a lucrative one, but how
can the leagues amass a credit balance when sports pro-
moters are allowed to take the first profits, leaving the
leagues to struggle over the remains ?

Among Sydney’s rising pugs, Watson, who
squelched “ Yank ” Pearl at the Newtown Pastime Club
the other night, stands out most, and bears the impress
of a probable champion of the near future. He shows
cleverness, pluck and force considerably in front of the
ordinary, though yet far from maturity. Watson will
build up a deal and possibly be a middleweight a year or
so hence.

The narrative of a retired pug as told to “X.Q.” :
“It was like this. The blokes up at the factory, knowing
I could go a bit, was always at me to have a lash at one
of these champions. Well, at last they put up a tenner
for me to fight that Dog Flat bloke, as he was about my
class. The chaps was to get half the stake if I won.
I got a trainer and went out to board at National
Park, and put in two months getting fit. The chaps
made it up with one of the halls to pay all expenses,
and to divide the rest of the gate money between the
winner and loser—7s per cent, to the winner. Well, the
fight came off and I won. It was a month before I was fit
to tackle graft again. And what for ? For blooming well
nothing and a doing into the bargain. When they made
up the gate money there was £ll6 in the house. The
hall, the advertisements, gas, tickets, blokes for the cash
box and looking after the seats, and other expenses
swamped £35. That left £Bl between us. I got
£6O, and £2O went to him, and the £1 was done-
in shouting. How the other bloke got on I don’t
know, but this is how I came out of it. Board and lodg-
ing for me and my trainer, £l6 ; his cut a tenner—he got
the other half of the tenner stake, too ; about a fiver in
fares, towels, shoes, and giving the blokes in my corner
something. That’s £3l out of £6O ; left me £29. I lost
12 weeks’ work—that’s £36 ; and I might have got
stiffened or broke up so as to be no good for work. But,
blime, what do you think ? My cobber grot poking about
the ticket box, and the back of it was loose so that the
fellow in the office selling tickets could put his hand
through the partition into it, take out the tickets and
sell ’em again. That was the knock out. No !—no more
fight for me. Three jim a week constant at the factory
is good enough—being a champion’s like serving yer time
to lug-biting.”

The big crowd at Sydney National Sporting
Club to see negro Felix knockout elongated Bill Smith
of Wallsend, in six rounds was disappointed, and appar-
ently very pleased to be so. Both fighters exceeded 6ft
Felix topping his competitor by a couple of inches. Why
the black was picked as a knocker-out is still a mystery •
he has never displayed sufficient of either punching power
or alacrity for that class of work, although he is probably
the cleverest of present-day Australian heavyweights.
Smith stood up and mixed things through the first
round, and also a portion of the second, which saw him
roughed to the boards, after which he depended mostly
on his footwork. Felix landed occasionally, but the
other, whose game was defence, did some clever evasive
work. When the sixth and last round was three parts
over Felix landed a heavy right swing on the jaw ; Smith
ducked and slipped on to one knee, and before the black
had grasped the situation he had swung another right,
which just grazed Smith’s countenance, whereupon the
referee declared Smith winner on a foul. Considering
that the offence was purely unintentional—and the
referee admitted it was—the judgment was harsh, if not
actually unfair. A caution would have met the case
amply. The crowd of alleged sports present continually
applauded the white and boohooed the black in a most
disgraceful fashion. Why, Heaven only knows. Felix is
a most gentlemanly fighter, a generous opponent who
conducts himself well in and out of the ring, and is one
of the most exemplary citizens in the Australian prize-
ring. The alleged “ British ” fair-play is not a feature of
the Australian bruise audiences.

Half-a-dozen star American amateur athletes—
the pick of the bunch who compete at the St. Louis exhi-
bition—will trip to Maoriland immediately on the con-
clusion of the Olympian games. M.L., however, doesn’t
feel equal to standing all the expenses, and would like
Australia to contribute. The Yanks will come over here
after skinning the land of the cold tea fanatic, and will
show the Commonwealth how to beat the pistol in six
different styles.

Saturday’s Commonwealth inter-’Varsity 8-oar
race was the 17th rowed. Of 16 previous contests Sydney
had appropriated nine, Melbourne five, and Adelaide two.
Melbourne led from go with Crow-eaters and Cornstalks
neck and neck till within 100yds. of the end, when a
mighty effort brought Adelaide second, three lengths
behind the winners and a length in front of Sydney.

The Dunlop Tyre Co. has made arrangements
for the competitors in the Goulburn Sydney road race to
be supplied with breakfast at Moss Yale (breakfast is
always enjoyable at Moss Yale), and other refreshments
at Picton and Campbelltown respectively, free of charge.
The distance is about 130 miles, and the first spin of 47
miles should generate a very healthy appetite ; the next
gap between refreshments is 37 miles, and the third only
20 miles. The winning post is the Town Hall, Ashfield.

The first day of English cricket (April 28) saw
W. G. Grace make the first 50 of the season. He was run
close by a most unlikely person, Tom Bichardson, who hit
up an astonishing 49. \V. L. Murdoch, the old Australian
captain, made the first 0 of the season. Braund only
made 8, and took one wicket.

The wail of “Louis M.” : “Can nothing be
done to check the rampant crookedness of some outback
amateur turf clubs ? The term amateur should suggest a
reputable engagement in the sport, but as a matter of
fact it is a name, under cover of which a certain class of
all-wool spielers work such scandalous ‘ readies ’ as would
put to the blush any professional pony-racing sharper. At
the initial meeting of a recently formed club the would-be
riders of outside horses were, on the first day, refused
admission to membership (a necessary qualification), the
consequence being that the only jockeys available to
visiting owners w 7 ere such as w'ould ride not as instructed
by the owners but as other interested members desired.
Visitors thus found themselves in much the same position
as the gent who tried his luck at Dandaloo. On the
second day, of course, it was a case of 1 let ’em all come ! ’
—things were smashed beyond mending by then. In one
of the races on the first day ‘ Johnny Armstrong’ was so
palpably in evidence that punters indulged in a demon-
stration, hurling hats and clods of dirt at the ‘ stiff un ’
and his puller. The g'rass-fed races at these meetings are
the most barefaced frauds, most of the horses being hard
and full with corn clandestinely supplied to them u’hilst
in the paddock. In cases where the owner of the paddock
is running horses himself, or is ‘in ’ w’ith others so placed
(which frequently happens), they are ‘ worked ’ as well as
corn fed.”

RAW and CHAPPED
HANDS
CARELESSNESS in dry-
ing after washing in cold
weather will producesore-
ness in the hardest hands;
but the pain endured by those
who have the misfortune in
winter to possess a sensitive skin
approaches positive torture. The
knuckles crack and bleed, the
cold enters a wound every time
it is newly broken; and inflam-
mation of a more or less serious
character is very liable to set in.
But the worst danger present is that of
blood poisoning which may ensue from
getting into the sores any grit and dirt
while cleaning. While ZAM-BUK is very use-
ful in preventing raw chapped hands (aild if
applied regularly will keep the skin all winter
quite soft and healthy), yet it is even more
valuable as a healer when this condition has
arisen. The hand should be first cleansed in
warm water and then annointed with ZAM-
BUK either with the finger or first spread on a
piece of clean linen. A few applications of
this kind will ensure the skin thoroughly heal-
ing up; more sensitive skins Should have
ZAM-BUK applied each night as required
and an ok! giove be worn till morning. The following is a striking
illustration i

There are the usual remarkable differences
between the values on which S. Australia land-
lords pay land-tax and the values which they
name when the matter of purchase for closer-
settlement purposes is broached. One estate,
for which the State actually paid £4 4s. per acre,
had been paying tax on 30s. per acre ; another, for
which an offer of £2 15s. per acre was refused with
extraordinary vehemence, had been paying on
under £1 per acre. S. Australia’s House of Land-
lords threw out a Bill a while ago authorising a
new assessment—on the ground, of course, that it
was hasty and ill-considered legislation.

Australia’s new malady is a weird anxiety
re seating accommodation. When Deakin fell off
the Treasury benches through bowing too slavishly
to Irvine and Bent, the Australian Parliament
was threatened with a free fight as to who should
sit on certain front benches. The discussion
spread all over the country, and in tram-cars and
on boats and on lonely roads people quarrelled
and nearly fought over the question whether the
ears and tail of Conroy should be elevated on the
cross benches or otherwise. The ears and tail of
Conroy would have been just as asinine no matter
where they were elevated, and even a hayloft
could not make them more so. Now, simultane-
ously with the announcement of the practical
obliteration of the Victorian “ direct Opposition,”
the great dailies are wondering what seats the
increased Labor party will occupy. The chief
concern of a Parliament, according to the great
dailies, is not the welfare of the country, but
where its members shall sit.
When N.S.W. Chief Justice Parley lifted
up his voice on the bench to express his private
and personal opinion on N.S.W. Arbitration Act,
he probably never expected that his first lapse
from dignified judicial impartiality would land
him in the shafts of the Fat Man’s political
donkey cart. But it has with a vengeance.
They’ve harnessed him up, branded him “ Vic.
Employers’ Union ” on the off, and he’s being
driven round Australia, with his judicial robes
trailing in the wintry slush, as an advocate of un-
limited sweating, unrestricted competition in
labor, and the inalienable right of the soft-
goods employer to pay wages which will drive
his workwomen to the streets to gain some of the
comforts of life. When the judge goes in for
politics on the bench it won’t be long before tbe
public insists on having the sort of politics there
that suits it ; and that meansan elective judiciary.
Mr.. Parley and his “brothers” can very easily set
such a. movement going—they have only to go
straight on, and get the Vic. Employers’ Union to
help them.
The Watchman has found out that Rome
was really responsible for the failure of the Reid-
Deakin coalition :
To those who have not been closely watching: the trend
of Federal and State Labor polities, it may be surprising'
to find how completely throughout the Commonwealth
Rome has nobbled the Labor party. Her political hopes
just now are centred in that party, not because she has
any sincere regard for the party or the people it is sup-
posed to represent—he would need to be blind, deaf, and
dumb who could make himself believe that—but because
it is the party out of which she thinks she can squeeze
most concessions for the time being. A Reid-Deakin
coalition would spoil Rome’s plans with the Labor party.
That yarn was probably inspired by Reid himself.
When a man falls through his own treachery
it is much nicer to say that he was a person of
such vast importance that all the machinery of
Rome was set in motion to crush him, and that
the huge conspiracy succeeded after a tremendous
fight in which Rome got severe bruises.
The Sydney Telegraph’s latest lie is to the
effect that Watson’s party wants to establish a
communistio settlement on the Federal territory.
It blathered in this wise :
Even the Senate, which is capable of doing many strange
things, was not equal to following a scheme for a magnifi-
cent communistic settlement in which miners, farmers,
clergymen, pastoralists, fishermen, legislators, and Minis-
ters would be mingled in a vast human olla podrida, all
living on each other, sharing each other’s means, doing
each other’s work in turn—the Ministers hurrying off into
the paddock to milk cows occasionally ; the milkman
rushing into the House to lead the Government. Ten
Senators out of the 34 in the Chamber were found voting
for this frenzied grasp for the millenium.
Nobody proposed a communistic settlement. The
alleged discussion about a communistic settlement
didn’t happen. No ten Senators voted for com-
munism. In fact, the whole yarn is a lie—the
mean lie of a hog-mean paper, which holds that
no slander is too low and no invention too monstrous
provided it is aimed at the Democratic Govern-
ment.

ONE WORD ONLY.
If you stop and think a minute, you will realise how impossible
ft is to depend upon certain words in the English language. There
are some words which have been used so promiscuously that they
have lost all significance. . . . > #
Take our English word “GIRL”—-it means a female child
anywhere between 3 «md 21 years of age; but, nowadays, we call
them all “girls” up to 100. When the baby’s sex is asked, we say “IT
is a girl,” and, when you engage a 65 year old cook, she is still “a

If you are a smoker, you will have found out by now, that
according to the Tobacconist, everything is “THE BEST,”
“COOLEST SMOKING,” “SWEETEST,” and a few other super-
latives in common use. The fact is, that you cannot, in the
least, depend on adjectives when tobacco is up for discussion;
but use one word only • ♦ . . .

NOTHING TO PAY.
W. : A Bulletin correspondent in a re-
cent issue instanced polo as a “ sport ” which runs
pigeon-shooting close for downright cruelty. Well, he
knows nothing about his text. I have had an intimate
acquaintance with both polo and pigeon shooting, and for
sheer, damnable, devilish cruelty the fowl-murdering
business wins in a canter. The polo pony is mostly a
well-cared-for, proud, aristocratic animal who takes a
delight in the game and earns a particularly good crust
by doing fast exercise for a few hours weekly. There is
not much cruelty in that; we don’t want to be hyper-
critical. On the other side I have seen 4 0 pigeons
smothered in the crates while waiting to be shot. During
the Championship and double rise shoots at Botany, when
the specially reserved birds, bred and trained at the care-
taker’s residence, are trapped, the pens and lofts are lit-
tered with mangled birds that managed to struggle the
few hundred yards between the slaughtering ground
•and their pens. Have also seen a pigeon, minus
legs, that flew from Hampden Shooting Grounds,
Pennant Hills, back to its loft in Sydney,
•and expired on the landing board. It was a prize homer
which had been stolen some few days before. Those are
particular instances. Take the ordinary routine of the
“ sport ” and see the butchery that the Sydney Telegraph,
the paper that attacked boxing, reports under the head of
“ Sporting.” A man armed with a seventy guinea gun
and the most improved ammunition fires at a half-stifled
bird that rises slowly from a trap at a range varying from
21 to 33 yards. If he only wounds the bird with the first
barrel, he can either call the dog to retrieve the maimed
fowl or put in the second and blow the bird to atoms.
When there are no wagers on his shot the mangled bird
■generally receives the second barrel to make things sure,
but if he has supported his first barrel to the extent of a
few paltry shillings the dog is called, and the spectacle of
a retriever chasing a wounded pigeon while the bookmaker
prays it will fly the boundary and the hen exterminator
hopes it won’t, is a sight that the religious editor of the
Telegraph should not miss. When the dog does run
down the bird he takes his time in returning to the
pavilion, and the pigeon, which may only have a broken
wing, takes a gallop round the grounds in the dog’s
mouth before having its neck wrung by the trap boy.
This goes on hour after hour. At the two weekly shoots
of the N.S.W- Gun Club at Botany about 600 birds are
mangled in this manner by a score of cheap and squalid
birdicides, who mostly hide their identity under shooting
aliases. Pigeon shooting stands alone as a most brutal,
iunclean game that calls for legislation and gaol.
“Jumbo”: Acted as judge in a William-goat
jrace ; distance, two miles. Each goat was attached to a
light cart, made out of a kerosene case, and carried a boy
■driver, weight sst. I started the race—one mile each
way—and took the time. The winner came in a yard in
front of the other. Time, smin. Neither competitor was
■ exhausted.

“Nat” : Contemplated conversion of old Exhi-
bition Building, Prince Alfred Park, Sydney, into swim-
ming .baths at an estimated cost of £BOOO, if carried out,
is sure to result in a dead loss. With sea-baths every-
where round the city, people won’t bathe where
it will be impossible to have the water fresh except
on the day that it is pumped in. No city swim-
ming bath could have had a better chance than the
old Pitt-street Natatorium, now a Salvation Army insti-
tution-well and attractively built, and full of up-to-date
appointments. Yet it broke almost every man connected
with it. Redfern Baths (now a boot factory) and the
Parramatta Baths, which cost £9OOO, were both huo-e
failures. It used to occupy a whole day to empty and re-
fill one of the Natatorium basins, and that could only be
done on Sunday, thus leaving the water in the other for a
fortnight. And until this city has got a big Japanese
population there’ll be no profit in fortnight-old water.

■ ' * Hyphen ” : It is not generally known that the
■dusky “Starlight” once wanted to take on world-
- champion Jeffries, and was refused. Jeffries, some seven
years ago, after his defeat of Fitzsimmons, was showing
at the London Aquarium. While there, he issued an open
challenge, in which he offered 2000dol. to the man who
could stand up to him for three rounds. “Starlight,”
who was in London at the time, went down to the
Aquarium to take him on. “ Star.” had a very healthy
reputation, however, having put up good scraps against
Bob Fitzsimmons and men in that class in Australia, and
Jeffries declined with thanks.
* * * *
Touching the first English cricket team (H. H.
Stephenson’s) that visited Australia, a writer in London
Referee wanted to know whether the elm trees which
Stephenson and Co. planted around the Melbourne 0.0.
Oval are still alive and flourishing. Some of them are
there—hale and hearty 42-year-old trees. Others had to
be cut down. They were in the way when improvements
came along. It is the ordinary fate of specially-planted
trees to be in the wrong place when they grow up.
“Right Timer”: Your contributor “Old Timer”
has a treacherous memory. It is true that Snelling, killed
in recent Randwick tram accident, acted as one of the
seconds to Christie in his fight with Jack Thompson, but
it is certainly not true that “ one punch settled Christie.”
The alleged pugilist who previously or subsequently got
knocked out in one round was Joe Thompson, brother of
Jack aforesaid, and afterwards known as the “Leviathan”
Victorian bookmaker. “ Old Timer ” must have had the
story of Joe’s discomfiture in his mind when he wrote the
par. The prize-fight between champion Christie (now
detective Christie, of the Vic. Customs) and chal-
lenger Jack Thompson, for a stake of £2OO, is recorded in
a Melbourne police-court report. The principals and their
seconds were charged with “ unlawfully assembling,” &c.,
at Black Rock, Brighton, on June 22,1877. The late Julian
Thomas, ‘ 1 the Vagabond,” was also included as a defendant,
in the character of a spectator of the mill, and among the
counsel engaged on the case were Purves and Bryan O’Logh-
len. Mounted-constable Eagleson was principal witness
for the Crown. Stated that on “information received,"
he rode off to Black Rock, and found Christie and Thomp-
son in fighting costume going for one another with the
“raws ” (no gloves or Queensberry rules at that time) in
a 24ft. ring. Tried to stop the battle, but was treated
with contumely by the crowd, so he stood aside and
“took notes of the proceedings.” Notes as follows :
“Mr. James Wilson acted as referee. Christie was
seconded by Tom Curran and Bill Snelling. Thompson
by Jem Mace and Sam Grim wade. The fight lasted about
35 minutes. There were nine rounds fought. Christie
was knocked down eight times ; at the finish he was
nearly blind.” Petec. Christie is a white-haired veteran
nowadays, but he is still a hard, wiry bit of stuff,
and it would take a powerful punch to settle him even
now. Presumably it was weight, rather than science,
that he lacked in his memorable go with Jack Thompson.
Jack, as I remember, was quite as tall as Christie, and a
lot thicker.

Announced from a reliable quarter that Jim
Stanbury, out of the sculling game since his defeat years
ago by Gaudaur in England, will challenge the winner of
the coming’ Towns-Tresidder match. If Stanbury can
get anything like fit, he’ll probably make things very
warm. Newspaper men generally appear to be mixed
regarding the ages and measurements of Towns and
Tresidder ; some assert the latter is much the elder and
bigger. As a fact, Towns is really two years the senior
(35), though appearing much younger. Towns is sft. BJin.
high, and will row list. ; while Tresidder is sft. 10Jin.,
and will sit in his boat on the day weighing about 12st.

The chance of any Australian pot-hunters going
to the Olympian Games at St. Louis (U.S.A.) at the
expense of the public is fading away. The Vic. Amateur
Athletic Association intimates that it is not in a position
to donate more than £25 towards the expenses of the
trip, but thinks that if a Victorian rep. were included
(irrespective of his sprinting capacity), local enthusiasm
might be flogged into parting up a trifle more. When
such a representative body can put up only just sufficient
money to land one rep. on the wharf at San Francisco
with a bob or two in his pocket, and the dreary gap
between St. Louis and ’Frisco is left for him to get over at
his own expense, the project is just about squashed.
Acting-Premier Wise has promised to introduce
a Bill during next session of N.S.W. State Parliament to
give people in charge of sporting grounds full power to
courteously deposit on his hearing organ outside the gates
any person found betting after being warned not to. Then
there will be some fun. Ikey Mo will go down to the
place of business surrounded with a barb-wire entangle-
ment and with a push of hired toughs in the rear, and,
safely entrenched behind his nose, bellow the odds as he
darned well pleases.

Tanunda, perhaps the most German of all S.A.
townships, has again had its annual “kingship” of the
rifle won by an Australian unconnected with the Father-
land. The £7O worth of prizes, and the hospitable wel-
come of the Teutons, now attract crack shots from Ade-
laide. Last year’s winner was J. T. Lake, of Bisley
experience, who made himself unpopular at the time by
modestly declining to wear a laurel wreath and walk at
the head of the customary procession. This year, how-
ever, he consented to be “ regally ” escorted to the ground,
but lost his title and his throne vegetable to A. H. Hill,
who had no previous reputation except with the small-
bore. The latter competition was won hy Hill for the
third successive year, and he completed a remarkable
double by winning the “ any rifle ” kingship as well. So
he had to wear two wreaths, and parade the streets of
Tanunda on the way to the customary banquet amid a
violent display of Teutonic enthusiasm and lager.
A Sydney suburban Deform candidate,
after firing off a torrent of abuse at the Labor
party, rounded off the attack by saying, “ In fact,
gentlemen, I think they’re only a crowd of otto-
mans.” The Deformer intended to say “auto-
matons,” and got reasonably near for one of his
class.

Dear Sir,—As a life-long abstainer, a Son of Temperance,
and Good Templar, I, for years past, recognised
Drunkenness—a disease, not a crime. When you, in
1896, introduced your Eucrasy Treatment I became
keenly interested and recommended it, so that I could
more closely watch its results. My experience, with what
1 may term my patients, has been such that I can without
hesitation testify to its curative effects, and, without any
soliciting on your part, I give you this testimonial
believing sincerely that by so doing I am carrying out my
Temperance pledges, “ To do all in my power to advance
the cause.”
I wish you success, for every patient cured adds to the
influence the Temperance Party require to enact
Prohibitory laws.
You are at liberty to use this testimonial as you deem
It. Yours sincerely,
W. F. STANTON, J.P.

Premier Seddon lately stated that lie had
a surplus of three-quarters of a million, and little
Fred Pirani’s paper, Petone Chronicle, made it
“ three quarters of mutton.” It was a humorous
mistake, and the comp, still holds his billet.
Federal Minister Mahon is frequently mis-
taken by Melbourne people for Argus associate
editor Cunningham. He is the same height, has
the same colored hair, wears glasses and wrinkles,
walks with the same swing, tailors in exactly the
same style, and is identical in every particular
save his treufi of political thought. Mahon is as
democratic as you make them, and Cunningham
has spent many years bolstering up the man with
a stake in Flinders-lane.
Some recent figures comparing the cost
ordinary burial and cremation are interest-
ing. Average cost of a burial in Britain is
£l4. The cost of cremation at Woking (Eng.)
is £6, which includes an urn for the ashes; at
Colders Green, one guinea for residents of the
borough and three for outsiders ; and at Glasgow,
£2, though if the incinerator were used more
widely the cost could be reduced to 10s. In
countries where cremation is widely practised the
cost is trifling. In Denmark it is 8s ; at Zurich
3s. 6d. ; at Breslau 3s. ; at Padua 2s. 4d. ; and in
Japan as low as Is. 9d.
Rev. Robert Powell, of the China Inland
Mission, told a Sydney Telegraph interviewer,
the other day, that he had dropped across one of
those colonies of Chinese which are alleged to be
of Jewish origin :
The number of Chinese was few, but there could be no
doubt from their appearance, observance of certain cere-
monies, records and institutions that they were of ancient
Hebrew origin. They have of late greatly diminished in
numbers, owing, in some measure, to inter-marriage and
assimilation, and in the Hou-nan district were only about
140 persons. He did not think they had much knowledge
of their ancient religion. They were known as “ the
pick-out sinew religion ” after the incident mentioned in
Genesis, chapter xxxii, verses 24 to 32. Once they had
beautiful Synagogues, but they had been destroyed. In
one case a solitary stone remained bearing the names of
Abraham, Moses, Adam, &c., with an account of their re-
ligion. They had now ceased to observe any religious
ordinances.
“D’Harum” talks with a mounted con-
stable :
No, I’m just a common trooper. I had a stripe one
time, but I lost it in less than 24 hours. There was a
vacancy in the vice-regal escort, and I was appointed to
fill it. The other three troopers were either corporals, or
sergeants, so to promote uniformity I was made a cor-
poral. To celebrate my rise in position, the others per-
suaded me to adjourn to a neighboring pub. I did, and
got back to the barracks hopelessly drunk. Soon we
were called out. With a good deal of trouble I mounted
my horse. “Corporal, sit back in your saddle.” I tried,
but flopped down on the horse’s neck again. “Advance !”
ordered the officer. We did. “Dismount!” he roared
again. I did—horizontally, in a heap. The officer in
charge came up with another superior. “ The man’s
drunk,” one said. “Corporal, stand up and salute a
superior officer.” I stood up and : fell right on to the
superior officer. “ Corporals Murphy and Jones, take this
man to the guard-house,” and after having - the stripe torn
from my arm, I was carried to the guard-house by the
pals for whom I had just shouted. That’s how I was
made corporal for a term of one day.
“H.”: One of the best cyclopaedias
makes the error of stating that all the Bounty
mutineers went to Pitcairn Island. Laying
down Becke and Jeffery’s excellent fiction, I
thought of sloppy accounts in different places,
and put together the facts, mainly with the aid of
the Dictionary of National Biography. Lieut.
Bligh accompanied Cook in his second voyage..
Then Bligh was entrusted with a small vessel, the
Bounty, under 250 tons, to introduce breadfruit
from Tahiti to the West Indies. The Bounty
stayed six months at Tahiti. The mutiny was
near the Friendly Islands. There were 44 men,
all told, on the Bounty. The mutineers put
Bligh in the boat with 18 men. This left 25 on
the Bounty. Bligh and party went 3618 miles,
to Timor. The Bounty returned to Tahiti.
Sixteen mutineers stopped there, and nine
went away in the Bounty to seek another
Ce. Shortly after Bligh reached Eng.-
, the Pandora, Captain Edwards, was
sent to bring the mutineers to justice.
Edwards went to Tahiti, and there found 14 sur-
vivors of the 16 mutineers. They were all taken
in custody, and the ship left. It was wrecked on
the Australian Barrier Reef, and four of the muti-
neers perished. This left 10 in hand. All the
survivors from the Pandora got to Timor in the
boats. The 10 mutineers were taken to England,
and tried by naval court martial. Three were
convicted and hanged. Three were convicted and
pardoned. Four were acquitted. Bligh went in
the Providence, and introduced the long-postponed
breadfruit, from Tahiti, to the West Indies. The
nine mutineers who left Tahiti in the Bounty were
not heard of for a q uarter of a century. They took
with them to Pitcairn six Tahiti men, 12 women
and several children. At Pitcairn, the Tahiti
men killed all the white men, except Adams.
Then the white men’s wives killed all the Tahiti
men. This left John Adams and a harem of eight
or nine women to found a new colony. Adams’
real name was Alexander Smith. Possibly he
concealed himself under an alms till he got his
house built, or possibly because clothing ran short.
“Johnnyßaw” sendsthis dubious story :
On receiving my annual seven days’ respite from the
“ weary round of toil ” lately, I took a trip over to Hobart.
Found Appletown dull as a day of humiliation, and blessed
my luck for deciding to spend four of the seven days in
the “lap of luxury”; said lap being the saloon of the
Oonah, and the luxury mostly a hurried rush to the
side. Met a Great Scot aboard. Discovered him on the
hurricane deck, feasting on the rugged, pillar-like forma-
tion of Cape Raoul after a hearty breakfast. Straightway
he claimed for the Land of Heather and Herrings supre-
macy in all things, human and divine, and inflicted his
predatory history and opinions upon me for the next two
hours. He had been a master printer in Glasgow for
30 years, when a long-suffering Providence laid him low.
An operation prolonged his days, and then he was
advised to try the sea. The advice, he told me, cost
two guineas, but the operation and the six weeks’
residence in the infirmary cost “ fust naething.”
“Ye see, ma meenister gied me a ‘line’ and made
that richt.” I suggested it was a pity he had not
got a “ line ” for that two guineas’ worth of advice also.
He assented, but excused himself by Saying, “ Weel, mon,
ye dinna think o’ the details when ye’re as faur through
as I wis. However I got a big reduction on ma ticket,
through a freend in the shipping way, an’ that was some
consolation.” Just then the bell rang, and I discovered
he was travelling round the world on a steerage ticket for
his health ! Sydney was his ideal “ toon,” for, as he said,
“ye can get a richt guid meal for saxpence.” Hobart was
a braw place, but there were some anomalies he culdna
understan’. “ The shops in the busy pairt chairge aboot
a-third mair nor the shops higher up; an’ I met a
Greenock mon at breakfast this mornin’. He’s been idle
for 10 weeks and, wad ye believe it, he wis sittin’ doon tae
a shullin’ breakfast, the same as mysel’! ’’ The thing that
puzzled him most was the absence of any visible dire
effects of socialistic legislation

Lidgey, late manager of Hampton Plains
(W.A.), and previously Government geologist in Victoria,
is now running a cyanide plant at Coolgardie. His electric
ore-finding apparatus, like the human article of the same
sort, seems to have proved a dismal failure. As a matter
of fact, the alleged success of the apparatus in Wales was
absolutely denied at the time by a director of the Welsh
Co., for which it was said to have located a lode. There
have been, and still are, dozens of divining-rod experts bn
the W.A. fields, but, like the professors of phrenologj r and
other dark arts, they are as poor as church mice. When
The Bulletin finds a man who has become a millionaire
per the divining rod it will think about getting converted.
Victory United, Cuddingwara (W.A.), doesn’t
look a very promising proposition, judging from the pub-
lished report of O. L. Fernald, of Kalgoorlie, whom writer
doesn’t know. Fernald states that the chute, so far as
proved, is unpayable, and consequently co. has no future,
except by dipping into the pockets of shareholders. He
suggests spending a mere £4OOO. Even if that is forth-
coming Fernald is anything but certain of the result.
Five to six years ago co. paid three divs. of 6d., and since
then has been systematically bleeding the shareholders by
continuous calls, and is likely to continue doing so till
the shareholders button up their pockets.
* * * *
Divs. already declared for June by W.A. mines
tot up £2o4,l4oGreat Boulder £87,500, Oroya-Brown
Hill £67,500, Sons of Gwalia £48,750, and Golden Ridge
£390. Total for half-year, £1,012,624 ; or fully £BO,OOO
more than for first half of 1903, although Associated
Northern, Peak Hill, Burbank’s Birthday Gift, Queensland
Menzies, and Island Eureka have failed to toe the mark.
* * * *
Lake View Consols' (W.A.) appears to well
maintain its ore reserves, though most of that lately
opened up is poor. Latest estimate gives about 170,000
tons, worth fully lOdwt. A rich vein is being driven on
north at 1600 ft., but is too narrow to materially affect-
results. Profit, after allowing for all ordinary expendi-
ture on mine, pans out about £4OOO a month, but most of
this is going into new plant. Present grade of ore would
have been absolutely worthless under a former extrava-
gant regime ; it is only by close economy that mine can
be kept jigging.
* * * *
Boulder Deep Levels, Kalgoorlie, have at length
issued official information of the rich strike at 900 ft.
The lode was encountered 180 ft. west of Gardner’s shaft,
and considerably less than that from Hannan’s Star
boundary. Width is 9to 12ft. for a length of nearly 250 ft.
driven, and the average values, 3oz. In places Ofe is very
rich. In the north drive the lode is heavy sulphide, but
going south it is free milling and also much richer.
According to present trend of lode, co. will have quite
2000 ft. before it passes out. Shaft is to be immediately
sunk another 100 ft., and a level driven at 1000 ft. Manage-
ment talks of erecting a treatment plant, but, with no ore
developed, that seems premature. If directors only place
the 70,000 reserve shares while the boom lasts, co. will
have enough cash to thoroughly open up the mine, and
provide a treatment plant. Recently-paid call of 6d.
realised £7OOO and makes the shares 19s. paid.
* * * *
Brown Hill Extended (W.A.) has driven 700 ft.
west at 700 ft. without meeting anything of value. Mine
appears to be last of the gold zone as, in spite of much
genuine prospecting by mines on the same belt, no pay
ore has been discovered. At recent general meeting-,
directors talked of giving present property best, and look-
ing out for a new one. Before taking this drastic step
manager Johns suggests crosscutting to western bound-
ary at 800 ft. This is not likely to strike success, but may
be worth trying as it won’t cost much. Company has
still over £30,000 in hand, so is in a good position to ac-
quire a new mine if anything good enough offers.
Recently registered in Perth (W.A.), Great
Fingall Associated G.M. Co. : capital, £125,000, in 10s.
shares, of which the vendors only take half and £lO,OOO
cash. The deepest shaft is a hole 130 ft. deep ; there is no
machinery ; in fact, there is nothing except 59 acres of
unproved land lying between the Fingall and the Rubicon,
known for years and consistently despised. The pro-
prietors appeal to the patriotism of Westralians to take up
shares: “ Every man and woman of this wealthy State—
the Golden West —should realise that the rich mineral
deposits of the country belong as a heritage to the people.
There is reason to deplore the fact that so few of our
mines are owned locally, and that the best of them are
yielding up their wealth to fill the pockets and swell the
coffers of the absentee proprietors.” Wonder how many
times the vendors or former owners tried to induce
London speculators to buy them out before they thought
of this “ patriotic ” gag. Somebody said that patriotism
was the last refuge of the company-promoter.
* * * *
Brilliant Extended, Charters Towers (Q.), ends
the half year to May 25 with a loss of £7328, so an effort is
being made to shift some of the directors. Doubtful if it
will come off, as those in power sit with large interests
behind them. That management has not been of the best
is indicated in report of the new manager, M‘Leod, or else
M‘Leod is talking wildly. He says :—“ A large mine
with any future at all in front of it cannot afford to neg-
lect profits resulting from crushing at its own mill, and
unless every possible reduction be made in this and
other surface costs, underground economies will be
wiped out by surface losses, and the condition of
the mine will never improve on the present
low grade stone.” Also, “ I believe that an all-round
reduction in mining and treatment of at least 16s. per
ton can be made.” M’Leod’s contention concerning
ownership of mill is sound ; it is astounding to note the
number of mines in Bananaland which are merely
working- for the millowners. In many cases shareholders
own the mine and directors own the mill —very sweet
arrangement. (This sort of thing is a common disease in
Queensland, where Government has put up loads of
money to help the sugar-growers, from whose labor the
privately-owned mills and refineries get most benefit.)
M’Leod’s statement as to a 16s. reduction in costs is
courageous, bht a lot of development in Brilliant Ex-
tended is required before figure will be realised. He
calculates on an output of 45,000 tons per annum, and if
he can turn this out, ore averaging 12dwt. should yield
dividends. But the co. must have its own mill, and
worthless material must be kept out of it. Worthless
material brings down tonnage costs, but it does not help
the dividend account. M‘Leod advocates sorting tables
and pickers. He’s on the right track.
* * * *
How consistently news leaks out about affairs of
Mount Lyell. Stock Exchange jobbers knew about the
big output long ahead and wired to London to cover.

An analysis of the figures in the Briseis (Tas. ) re-
port for 1903 is desirable in the light of Lake and Currie’s
revised estimate of the property of May, 1902. Overburden
to go off the Briseis Hill was, according to Currie,
875,650 cub. yds. ; taken off in 12 months, 273,000 cub.
yards, leaving nearly all the solid basalt to be shifted.
Overburden at the Southern workings, 906,000 yds. ; re-
moved, 131,640 cub. yds. Currie’s estimate of drift in the
mine, 2,711,000 cub. yds. ; sluiced during- the year,
256,940 yds. Overdraft on December 31, 1902, £38,050 ;
on December 31, 1903, £37,130. Therefore, while
reserves of tin-drift were trenched on to the extent of
nearly one-tenth, only a quarter of the over-
burden, and that the softest part, was removed.
Currie would not endeavor to estimate the tin contents of
the drift, but he hinted that it might range between 41b.
and 111 b. per cubic yard, This estimate pretty well hit
the mark, for the bottom dirt at the Ringarooma faces
avfeaged last year 7 - 151 b., while the middle and top drifts
went 2-531 b. per cubic yard. Briseis A, C, and D faces
went respectively 2’231b., 2 - 441 b. and 3-431 b. per cubic
yard. On the basis of metallic tin, the past half-year’s
sluicing was 2-641 b per cubic yard dealt with, or a monetary
value of under 2s. lOd. per cubic yard. Raise this amount
to 45., and on Currie’s estimate of 2,711,000 cubic yards
of drift, the value of the mine is about £550,000. Out of
this has to come the value of tin won during the year,
and the overdraft, or, together, over £70,000 ; and also
the costs of future working. Lindsay Clark’s work on
drift and overburden cost over Is. per cubic yard for the
past six months. Cut future operations down to 9d., and
over £lOO,OOO will be eaten up in that direction. Now
take £170,000 from £550,000, divide by 600,000, and the
probable value per share of the mine is arrived at —about
12s. Bd.

Little Longford, of Melbourne, who put up
Brothers 1 from Bs. to 15s. lately and scored as usual, has
been for a fortnight at Derby (Tas.), where he is said to
have secured 500 acres of Briseis tin country ; so appar-
ently a deal of. some size is coming.
Mt. Read (Tas.) shareholders met in London a
few weeks ago, and decided to keep on doing nothing.
Mine has large bodies of highly complex sulphide ores
which there is no known method of treating, and if a
process were discovered co. has no money left wherewith
to provide plant, though there is still 3s. per share
callable on 150,000 shares. Bull bought the mine in 1901,
and has got nothing out of it since, and if he fobgets he
ever owned it he may be all the happier.
Why doesn’t someone tell the facts about the
New Dalcoath (Tas.) option? Either Hertzig inspected
for Bewick-Moreing or he didn’t. When he was at the
mine no one troubled to contradict the report that he was
there for the firm. Now that the firm reports that it
won’t touch the mine, Go. says, “ You never had an
option.” Then who did?
Waihi (M.L.) made a net profit of £364,944 for
Cohen last year, as against £273,737 in 1902. Bullion was
valued at £658,393, from 231,323 tons. Directors paid 10s.
in divs. with a 2s. bonus, put £20,000 to the reserve fund
(now £120,000), and carried forward £21,650 (£30,353 had
been brought forward). There were 583,464 tons of ore
in sight at the end of the year, and the No. 7 level was on
the way to reach the reef system. On its 495,000 shares
the dividends were equal to £297,000. This puts the
Waihi second only to the Perseverance in the matter of
divs. paid by Australasian mining co.’s last year. The
Perseverance paid £300,000.

Rockhampton (Q.) is still waiting for J. Bull to
develop the anthracite coal measures which are supposed
to exist in the district. Twelve months ago, Adelaide
speculators caused a little flutter by sponsoring the
Mammoth Anthracite Coal Co. Charles Angell went to
London and found a hopeful-looking Cohen, but the
money which was “ a certainty” if the “expert’s report ”
was favorable, has not yet arrived. The “expert’s
report” wheeze is played out as far as Queensland is
concerned, and had better be pensioned off. What Bull
wants just now is concessions ; Government to take all
risk. Reported recently that Mammoth had been floated
for £lOO,OOO in London. Wrong. Facts are an option haa
been taken over the property to form a co. with a capital
of £50,000, which is a very different matter. Mammoth
people have spent a little money in testing parts of pro-
perty, and good coal has been struck. But, unfortunately,
property is not very favorably situated. It is off the
central line, and a branch line would be necessary. Then,
if the central line were tapped—somewhere near Black-
water—the product would have to be railed approximately
120 miles to seaboard. Promoters urge that the superior
quality of the coal will stand this ; but the superior
quality has yet to be demonstrated. The alleged
anthracites of Queensland, despite good analyses, have
not proved glorious successes in steam trials so" far. It is
said the steam tests were not conducted intelligently.
“ Chasselas ” : The time-honored ruse whereby
Vic. cookies evaded paying income tax was rudely exposed
in Vic. law courts lately. The income tax crowd scented
their prey—a cocky with two sons working for him on a
clothes and tucker basis. When called on to pay income
tax he trotted out his sons as partners in the concern and
the profits, when divided into three, didn’t run into a tax-
able amount. Evidence showed the sons had no interest
in the land and had no banking account. The J.P. bench
found in favor of the fanner, of course, but the income
tax prosecutor brought the case before a judge, who
reversed the magistrates’ decision and with costs against
the cocky. The income tax officials are on a strong scent
of boodle, and if they run the trail closely the wail of the
cookies will be as the wail of Dent when he goeth about
raging against socialism.

was only 10’7dwt. —less than that of the lowest mine on
the Rand list —and still, without any cheap Chow,
£98,835 was paid in divs., and a fine lot of prospecting
was done into the bargain.

“ W.W.” : lie gold-mining rents, I say that until
the miner pays royalty the mining laws never will do jus-
tice to a large number of miners. For instance, one man
secures 10 acres in hard country, and doesn’t get enough
out of it to pay for pointing his picks, and does not
damage a quarter-acre of soil. He pays £lOO in rent.
Another secures 100 acres, and in one year or less, if it be
shallow ground, destroys the whole lot and also damages
hundreds of other acres. But no matter whether they
get loz. or 1,000,0000 z., and whether they spoil the land
or not, they pay the same amount. I don’t agree that
mining land should be classed as pastoral land, nor do I
say a miner who pays £1 per acre yearly rent for land
(not worth a shilling an acre sometimes) pays too much ;
I only say miners should pay royalty, or that a distinction
should be made between sluicing and other claims.

Spite of their alleged failure, coal-cutting
machines continue to show up in the Newcastle (N.S.W-)
collieries. A.A. Co.’s Hebburn No. 1 and Seaham Co.’s
Abermain are both just introducing them, the latter to
be worked by electric power.

In order to bring the mines regulations up to
date in Westralia, a commission has been appointed to
take the work of drafting a new Act off the shoulders of
a weary department. Seven members have been ap-
pointed, including the State mining engineer, and ex-
Government Geologist Jack (late of Queensland). All
seven draw three g-uineas a sitting and travelling ex-
penses. It may not be the correct thing, but in Westralia
all members of Royal Commissions, whether drawing- pay
as Parliamentary representatives or not, are paid for
attending sittings of Royal Commissions. The confi-
dential clerk of the Minister for Mines has been appointed
secretary—a very common thing in Westralia, where
officials have a lien on secretaryships and anything else
carrying a good salary. Labor people are angrily asking
how civil servants who are supposed to be overworked—
at the time the Estimates are being considered—can
find time to accompany Royal Commissions over the
country, drawing salaries and expenses, whilst their
ordinary work is being done without extra assistance.

The remarkable effects of Protection on the iron
and steel industry are shown in figures prepared for the
British Tariff Reform Commission. From 1876 to 1880
Britain produced 45 per cent, of the world’s pig-iron ; under
Freetrade the proportion fell steadily, until in 1902 it pro-
duced only 19 per cent. Moderately-protected Germany’s
figures rose from 14 to 18 per cent., and the highly-
protected United States’ from 14 to 36 per cent. Tho
foreign-trader says that Australian consumption isn’t
large enough to give the industry a hope. On this point
American figures are suggestive : for, with the means to
supply it, the demand there has grown so enormously
that for every 100 tons of steel used in 1876-80 1081 tons
were used in 1902.
* * *
“M.C.” : Official figures from copper and lead
mining co.’s indicate that the end of some of them as
large producers is near. Comparatively a few mines
supply the bulk of the world’s copper and lead. In 1900
Colorado had eight mines producing 80,000 tons lead, in-
cluding the Lake mine with an output of 24,000 tons.
Five Broken Hill mines produce 120,000 tons lead from
approximately 1,200,000 tons ore. In copper, such pro-
ducers as the Anaconda, United Verde, Calumet and
Hecla, and Rio Tinto are down to very deep levels, and
waste dumps and tailings are becoming used up. To get
much metal from very poor ore soon tells a tale. New
discoveries are made infrequently. On a 10 per cent,
basis of recovered lead from each ton of ore, Broken Hill
at present rate would exhaust 12,000,000 tons of ore in
ten years ; and it takes that much to maintain the world’s
lead supply for less than 18 months. As a whole, con-
sumption is rapidly outpacing development, and must
produce a highly speculative range of prices.
AT POVERTY POINT.
A star she-mummCr wrote with a dramatic flourish in
an autograph bore’s book the other day, “We live in
moments.” The he-star of the co. followed on with—
“ And those moments cost us our life.” And now that
autograph Miss is wondering thickly what kind of a joke
is this.
Beauty actress Elsie Moore’s father is Commissioner
of Lands and Public Works in Fiji. His wife, for health
reasons, resides with the children in Melbourne.
George Rignold was once playing at Newcastle, and
there was a scene in which the excited village maidens
were supposed to stand in groups outside the church, or
the stable, or some place, and chatter volubly to each
other. But they were mostly new hands, and stared
woodenly at the audience, and didn’t chatter worth a
cent. Then came a voice from the wings that was audible
all over the house —the voice of George with a hiss of rage
in it: “ Smile, blast you ! ”
The new Gaiety production was originally called “ The
Girl from Jay’s.” Though the title was a good advt., the
proprietors of Jay’s, a big London drapery shop, objected,
so “ Kay’s ” was substituted.
Winton, without M’Ginty, gave a professional opinion
about tights the other day. His wife wanted to publicly
put them on ; M’Ginty’s partner objected, and there was
coldness in the family, which ended in a rule nisi return-
able in six months. Winton’s name for this one appear-
ance only was White—plain John White.
“Melbourne”: Bulletin (26/5/’O4) credits Miss Maud
Ohetwynd with having severed, last year, the tie binding
her to her husband. This is incorrect. Her petition for
divorce, listed as “Singleton v. Singleton,” is set down
for hearing in August, on her return from M.L.
Scribner’s Magazine lately published the yarn of a
gullible Yankee re the crowds who used to assemble out-
side the doors of Irving’s Lyceum when a new production
was coming along. According to this artless romancer
“the queue often gathered 24 hours and more before the
opening of the door . . . and in the morning, after that
long, cold night, Ellen Terry came out from the theatre
and with her own hand gave each weary worshipper a
sandwich and a cup of sustaining coffee.” The notion of
the eager Saturday night crowd beginning to line up
what time the Friday nigliters were also waiting for ad-
mission is not funnier than the picture of Ellen conveying
sandwiches and coffee from the theatre in the early next
day, as though she slept on the premises beside a refresh-
ment-stall.
At a recent meeting of Adelaide fruit-growers, the first
speaker was O. M. Leumane, the old comic opera tenor,
the original (or nearly so) Australian Nanki Poo in the
“Mikado.” His last singing engagement was with
Musgrove’s Wagnerian opera co.
“Hiphen”: Went to “The Darling of the Gods” last
week, and it was a good 3s. worth ! Murders, tortures,
happy despatches, sudden deaths and tears, with a bird’s-
eye view of Heaven and hell thrown in. It is a play that
would wring pity from a pawnbroker ! Julius Knight, of
the kinky kerosene shampoo kiss-curls, does not appear,
but a new Marcus Superbus sort of Julius, with a most
unromantic topknot, holds the stage. He looks not a
little bit pretty—only fat, stodgy and respectable. He is
the leader of a push, and his fondness for Yo-San, a Jap
princess disguised as Miss Maud Jeffries, is his long suit.
But the villain, the Minister for Battle and Commissariat,
gathers him in and deals severely with him, till his girl
“ blows the gaff on his ten cobbers,” and so secures his
temporary release on ticket-of-leave. As punishment for
this betrayal, she is disqualified from the abiding place of
the gods for the term of 1000 years, pending an
inquiry. Thereupon the lovers arrange a meet,
-under the clock, one thousand years hence, and,
after pledging each other to punctuality, com-
mit suicide in a most orderly and tidy manner.
They keep the appointment; but what I want to know
is: Where was Maud Jeffries during that 1000-year
interval ? She wasn’t in heaven, having- been disqualified
for not pacing Major Taylor or something. She wasn’t in
Sheol, for her clothes aren’t burnt off her. And if Wil-
liamson doesn’t explain where she was, I’ll wreck the
theatre and throw the pay-box and Julius Knight’s kiss-
curl into the Pacific. lam not a person to be fooled with
impunity. Can J. Cassius W. fight ?
“ And,” said Cuyler Hastings, impressively, in the first
‘act of “ Sherlock Holmes,” “ if that cry is heard ” (here an
infant howled like a shocking banshee in the gallery), “ it
will be” (in a terrible voice) “ a very onfortunate thing
for those who are responsible ” (here the alarmed mother,
thinking Sherlock meant to slay her offspring, gathered
up the infant and fled). Cuyler is subject to coincidences
like that. One night, he had just stated, as blind Dick
Heldar, “ I’ll stand in no man’s way,” when a yell of “ Sit
down in front ” temporarily suspended proceedings.
“F.”: Apropos Mr. George Coppin and his 85th birth-
day, I have just dug up a par. from a London newspaper
dated Oct. 27, 1855. “ Before leaving Sydney' for Mel-
bourne Mr. G. V. Brooke and his manager, Mr. George
Coppin, gave £326 to the Patriotic Fund.” The Crimean
Patriotic Fund first obtained for Dan Cooper his knight-
hood, -and the Lancashire- Relief Fund got him his
baronetcy.
Aleck M'Kinley, of Melbourne, the pale,
humorless man who runs Paunch, put up for East
Yarra Province, in the interests of paunch
generally, and was licked. Aleck came forward
with a splendid scheme for relieving the taxpayer
of the heat and burden of the public service pen-
sions, but it proved to be only the ingenious old
device of handing the burden on to posterity, or
else it was an appalling miscalculation and a fear-
some drunkenness of figures. Bent adopted the
idea for a while, and walked heavily .round it, like
a hen circumnavigating its solitary chicken, but
very little has been heard about it of late.
One of the most useful Institutions of this
country promises to be The Diabetic Institute of
London, established for scientific research into the
origin, cause and treatment of Diabetes and the
secondary symptoms: gout, rheumatism, car-
buncles, &c. Hardly any disease is so little
understood, and at the same time so insidious and
dangerous as Diabetes, which, according to the
highest modern authorities, is curable after all,
when treated in time. If interested, write to the

A Carcoar (N.S.W.) alderman the
kerbing and guttering creature of a small town—
thus explains the Constitution of Australia :
The Mayor said New South Wales was being- openly
tricked by Federal legislators out of her undoubted
rights, and he thought the time had come when the
State Parliament should take a hand in the matter by
making a definite offer of Lyndhurst to the Federal
Parliament.
Mr. V. B. MacDermott said that the Constitution Act
was very clear on the question of surrender 'of territory.
New South Wales would be acting legally in offering to
the Federal Government the site she considered most
suitable. The 100 miles radius limit meant that the
capital should he located as near to the limit as possible,
and not in a remote corner of the State. He considered
that Lyndhurst should be offered by the State Parlia-
ment.
Now that a bush alderman has explained that the
Constitution clearly intended the Federal capital
to be in his back yard the matter may presumably
be regarded as settled.
One of the highest-grade tobaccos ever put upon
the Australian market is Sunol, for which Mick Simmons
is sole agent for Australasia. Any smoker in city or coun-
try who reads this paragraph ought to cut it out and send
it, together with ss. 6d. for cut or plug, to Mick Simmons’,
Haymarket, Sydney. By return, post free, the sender
will receive one pound of Sunol. The new tobacco is free
from impurities or adulteration of any kind. It is cool
smoking, and has no perfume other than a natural aroma.
For purity and excellence it took first prize at the last
Royal Agricultural Society’s Exhibition, and the judges,
who are all veteran smokers, have smoked none other
ever since. You cannot go wrong in trying it for your-
self. It has caused quite a sensation among- the city
smokers.*

Sydney Daily Telegraph announces that
Austin Chapman is one of the eager workers
among the Protectionists for a Reid coalition. A
malicious slander surely ! Nothing would kill
Chapman’s political future more surely than to
become a Reidite. In the event of a dissolution,
Chapman’s Monaro seat would be very seriously
threatened by a representative of the Watson
Government, the only one which has so far shown
itself in earnest over the Federal Capital.
W. N. Willis, M.L.A., as a land agent

The affidavit of Melbourne insolvent, John
M‘Gee, is probably unique in its way. Veteran
M‘Gee, who is just now running a brewery,
states that he 1 ‘ was previously in financial diffi-
culties in 1855 and 1870, and at last became
unable to pay his debts as they fell due in 1901.”
His experience of business troubles thus covers a
period of half a century. And all these years of
worry haven’t killed John M‘Gee.

from which 1 suffered for many
years. Your Medical Treatment
has done me more physical good than
I ever anticipated."
Mr. Q. H. BERNARD.
Mr. G. H. BERNARD was a sufferer,
and —to quote his words— '' a physical
wreck ” —in 1902. Yet here is an
extract from his letters sent after a
few weeks’ treatment:
“ Qanmain Station, via Wagga.
“ 1 am getting on steadily and surely.
My nerves are in a much better state
now. 1 am not now subject to those
severe frontal headaches. My brain is
quite capable of executing any reason-
able amount of labor offered it."
Mr. 0. D. HAILEY.
From Toorak, Victoria, Mr. G. D.
HAILEY chronicles his improvement
from chronic dyspepsia, from which he
was a great sufferer. In his reply to our
queries concerning his health, he
states:
“1 am (jetting on first-class. 1 have
not had better health for many years.
The medicine you sent me was the very
thing in every respect. / feel certain
that I will continue to improve, and
ultimately regain my usual health."

SIGNOR CARLO DANI.
SIGNOR CARLO DANI, the dis-
tinguished operatic tenor of the Royal
Italian Opera Company, Sydney, says
in reference to the treatment he
received:
“ I desire to inform you that, owing
to the great lassitude I have experienced
here, due no doubt to sudden climatic
changes, I tried your treatment, from
which I have obtained great benefit to
my muscular and nerve systems."
Mr. CHAS. KENNINGHAM.
Mr. CHAS. KEHNIKCKAM, prin
cipal tenor Royal English Opera
Company, Savoy Theatre, London,
and Royal Comic Opera Company,
Sydney, declares that he has in a
few weeks been completely cured
of Insomnia :
“ For years past I have suffered
from Insomnia. Your treatment,
ivas brought to my notice, with
the result that lam now sleeping
reasonably, and my general health
is much improved."

“ Burglar Bill ” : Saw three Chinese
prisoners, with sentences of four, six and nine
months, arrive at a country gaol. The warder
who escorted the prisoners didn’t know one pagan
from the other on arrival, and the three seemed
to have got mixed themselves, for when he called
out “ One Lung ” all three smiled in recognition
and nodded vaguely; and when he called “ Hop
Fat ” they did the same; and when he read from
the list the name of “Ah Sing” they again
bobbed unanimously Warder Hooligan was non-
plussed. He put them into different cells while
he reviewed the situation. Next morning I found
he had sorted them out, and a description card
with number and sentence swung at the door of
each cell. The sweeper in the wing said that
Hooligan wrote the three names on bits of paper,
put them in his cap and made each Chow draw
one and thus select his own identity, so to speak.
I believe this must have been so. The heathen
that got the nine months swore fearfully in Boxer
dialect when the second man was released, and
threatened to murder Hooligan with a chopstick if
he ever met him in Sydney.
“ Squidge ” sends this more or less truth-
ful narrative :—-
Re Bulletin par. (5/5/’O4) about laxity of discipline in
S. Aus. labor prison. The fashion in which such things are
run on the Tasmanian West Coast would just about knock
even the S.A. prison warder silly. I once went to call on
a man who was supposed to be doing a month at Strahan
gaol. I reached the gaol—a structure about up to the
knee of the average prison over here —at 11 a.m., and
asked the “ wide asleep ” warder for prisoner Jones.
“ Jim Jones ? ” replied the warder, reflectively—“ Oh,
’e’s down ther town gettin’ a skinful, I reckon. He got a
bit er galener yesterday fer some work ’e done for the
town board. 'E’ll be back to dinner, p’raps. Any’ow
’e’ll turn up before dark. We ’as orders to stop prisoners’
libertj' ef they stays out after dark.”
“But,” I expostulated, “what the”
“’E couldn’t git away,” said his wardership, anticipat-
ing my objections ; “ now’ere to git to. Any’ow, Tassy
Gov’mint couldn’t afford warders ter watch blokes like
Jones.”
Later I had occasion to travel from Queenstown to
Strahan by way of Mt. Lyell’s expensive Abt track.
At former sulphurous inferno I saw the sub-inspector of
police come sauntering down to the railway station
accompanied by a pair of unshaven, dirty-looking black-
guards, who got into my compartment of the train. Mr.
Sub-inspector stood talking to the stationmaster, but
just as we moved off he stuck his head into the compart-
ment and said : “ Oh, there —are you ? You’ll be
all right now. Ta ! ta! ” I had romantic visions of
detectives in disguise about to raid some shanty in the
hills and capture some ferocious criminal. So I questioned
a Lyellite who sat beside me, and found that the two
worthies were just prisoners going to Strahan for a
month. “ You see,” explained my fellow traveller,
“they never send any vermilion bobbies with them
because they scarlet well haven’t got any to spare—and,
anyhow, the men cannot escape to any gory where.”
(N.B. —Everybody on Lyell talks like that—that is, all
simple-minded folk. The language of the more intelli-
gent Lyellite is much more complex.)
When we got to Strahan a policeman leisurely came up
to the two alleged prisoners and said “ Hello !—back
again ? ’’
“ Yes, ’ere we are, Pete ! ” replied one of them, and the
trio strolled off towards the infant gaol.
Yet Strahan is Macquarie Harbor, and still has relics of
Garden Island, the coal mines, and all the other devil-
doms of the old penal days. Truly tempora mutcmtur.
A case of which the “great Freetrade
cause ” ought to be proud has lately been dug up
in Marylebone, England: three generations of one
family in one workhouse ! The grandfather is there
because “he could not get work.” His wife is
there for the same reason. Two of their daughters,
married, are inmates ; and the four children of one
and the one child of the other are now “on the
parish.” Most of these latter were born in the
workhouse. “ A large number of women habitu-
ally come into the workhouse when their children
are about to be bom,” the medical officer reports.
Merry England !


Two Sides of a Story.
It is astonishing how different the figures come
out when a man is claiming damages against a rail-
way company for injuries which prevent him
following his business, and when he is making a
statement of his income for the information of the
Income Tax Assessors. There is only one parallel
to this strange phenomenon, and that is what some
medicines are said to do and what they really will
do. Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup is the ex-
ception that proves the rule. That this great
remedy is an infallible cure for indigestion and all
bilious diseases has been established by countless
cases. Here is one of them. “Tor three yearsT
suffered from chronic indigestion, and in all that
time was unable to obtain any relief, ” writes Mrs.
Champion, of 17, Rose Road, Surrey Hills, Sydney,
N.S.W. “ I had no appetite, and the little I ate
caused me great distress. Sleepless at night, and
with headache by day, my condition was very
serious. But Mother Seigel’s Syrup was equal, to
my case. Eight bottles of that wonderful medicine
cured me.”*

READ THIS
LITTLE BIT OF
OUR HISTORY,
IN the year eighteen-seventy-one we occu-
pied a small store in Park Road, Liver-
pool, England, where we sold a watch
now and again, but not nearly so often as
we would have liked nor as often as we con-
sidered such reliable watches should be sold.
We were confident that our watches were as
good as could be got—the trouble was how
to get the public to know. We pondered
over this subject day and night and finally
concluded that we would try what the news-
papers could do for us. Such a thing as
selling watches through advertisements had
never been done in England before, still we
were convinced that once the general public
knew that our watches were what we said
they were—Reliable—we must succeed.
You know how it is with a man who has a
dependable watch—he is proud of it and
loves to speak of its accuracy, and naturally
the firm who supplied the watch comes in for
a full share of the credit. Well—we put
our everything into the venture. How we
succeeded our eight splendid Australasian
stores give testimony. Orders flowed in
from all over the World, particularly from
Australia and New Zealand In fact, so
numerous were the orders that we decided
to open in Sydney. Our success was
phenomenal, and in Melbourne, Auckland,
and Dunedin we had to open shops, followed
later by Perth, Wellington, Christchurch,
and Brisbane, each being a success. What
better proof of the satisfactory performance
of our watches do you want ?
vv
This is a 14ct. Gold Keyless Hunting Cased Watch,
suitable for young ladies. It has a reliable jewelled
movement—exquisitively engraved solid 14ct. gold
cases—strong keyless work, and altogether is a sound
and serviceable watch. It is possible to sell a gold
watch at a lower price, but as the time-keeping and
construction is not such as would give lasting satis-
faction to our customers, we do not stock them.
Price, £4 IQs.

This Watch, for either gentlemen or youths, is
rightly named the “ Triumph,” inasmuch as, although
sold by us at such a low price, it is a gigantic
“Triumph” in quality over any other low-priced watch
already in the market. It has a very fine-finished,
full-jewelled keyless short-winding movement, and
the case is made of a very hard nickel, beautifully
polished, fitted with unbreakable crystal glass. Price
18/6. With Silver Case, 30/-.

Some Monaro Notes.
Natube designed the Monaro to provide the
citadel of the Australian nation. The district is
well watered, fertile, climatically perfect and,
perched as it is on the “roof” of the continent,
admirably designed for a fortress territory. The
resources possible to an area of, say, 5000 miles in
the Monaro district are almost incredible vast.
The climate would range from the frigid
of the mountain tops to the sub-tropical of
the coast, the vegetation from the palm to
the edelweiss. The products could range
from gooseberries to grapes, from barley to
maize. There would be embraced great forests,
promising mineral reefs, rolling wheat plains and
rich pastures, a fine seaport and the greatest
mountain in Australia. Innumerable streams
would give water and motive power for industries,
and a matchless climate the bodily vigor which
prompts to enterprise. Most Australian mountain
districts are barren; the Blue Mountains in N. S. W.
will hardly grow grass. But the Monaro tableland
buttressing the great Snowy Range is built up of a
rich volcanic loam which will produce almost any-
thing. At Mr. Ronald Campbell’s station, just
outside Bombala —where, according to the mis-
understood humor of Mr. Bill Lyne, “ trees won’t
grow”—there is one of the finest collections of
trees and shrubs to be seen outside the Sydney
Botanical Gardens. But, more important than
the vegetation, men can grow on the Monaro.
In that champagne air the body grows vigorous,
and the “tired feeling” of the coast and the hot
plains vanishes. Consider the climate, how it
makes the man to grow, and a good deal of the
reason will be found for the bustling, energetic,
Protective spirit which pushed Victoria ahead on
such slight motive power whilst N.S.W. slept on
giant resources, lotos-eating and professing Free-
trade views.
It seems now almost certain that the Australian
Parliament will endow the Australian capital with
the Monaro climate. Other districts are fading
out of the race and leaving but two sites in the
running—Bombala and Dalgety. These two
towns differ but little except in magnitude.
Bombala is the capital of the Southern Monaro
district, and its chief distributing centre. Dalgety,
or Buckley’s Crossing, to the N.E., is a much
smaller place. The character of the surrounding
country is in each case the same.
An easy day’s drive from Cooma, the terminus
of the Southern railway, brings a traveller to
Bombala. The town itself is situated in a hollow,
surrounded by little hills ; nevertheless, the
Bombala River flowing through the town, the
general greenness of the landscape in this
drought-proof land, and the clearness of the atmos-
phere make the place attractive enough. Some
three miles out is the proposed Federal capital
site, a great stretch of green and gold plain,
bounded by low hills and watered by Campbalong
Creek and the Bombala River. From this point
the distance to Twofold Bay is about 60 miles ; by
railway it would be a little more. A line of rail-
way has been surveyed to the coast and it offers
no very great engineering difficulties. At present a
coach road runs from Bombala to Eden down the Big
Jack mountain ; the proposed railway would take a
longer and an easier route. To Sydney a railway
from Bombala might pass through the flourishing
little town of Nimitybelle (to reach which it would
have to climb up and down an extra 1000 ft.), or,
avoiding that town, take a more direct route. To
Melbourne, a railway would be possible from a
point on the proposed coastline called Bondi,
through the upper Gippsland, at a cost of some-
thing like £650,000. Roughly, the Bombala site,
with a coast railway, would be about 10 Pours
from Sydney, 14 hours from Melbourne, and tvJo
hours from Twofold Bay. There is not a certainty
of a large supply of water by gravitation to Bom-
bala, but any amount is available by pumping.
To see the Dalgety site at its best, travel
direct from Bombala, crossing the M‘Lachlan
River by a little-used road. As you reach the
top of a steep rise from the valley of the
M‘Lachlan there opens a glorious view of the
Snowy River Plain, with Dalgety in the middle-
distance and the great Snowy Mountains—the
snow fields glistening like bosses of silver on
shields of blue—in the background. It is a noble
prospect, those mountains, decked _in silver,
standing as guardians over the plains, golden
with summer grasses. It pleads for Dalgety
powerfully. The further advantage that Dalgety
has over Bombala is of water, the Snowy River
providing an ample gravitation supply and
also having vast possibilities for the generation
of electric current. So far as distances go
Dalgety, compared with Bombala, is somewhat
nearer to Sydney, somewhat further from Mel-
bourne, and half as far again from the coast. If
the extent of the area to be resumed for a Federal
territory were to be guided by Australian national
considerations alone and 5000 square miles were
obtainable, I would be inclined to favor Dalgety
as against Bombala, since such an area would
allow of the land stretching down to Twofold Bay.
As things are, with a mistaken N.S.W. pro-
vincialism jealous to keep the resumed area down
to the smallest possible limits, there is better hope
of getting a port with Bombala than with Dalgety,
and Bombala with a port would be much better
than Dalgety without a port. Bombala should
be, therefore, still the Australian national choice.

A Ballarat miner appeared at the police
court the other day with a waxed moustache on

She got an order for 12s. 6d. a week and the Bench
said that defendant’s conduct had been disgraceful.
Fact is, the men who twist the ends of their lip
whiskers into greasy spikes are very apt to be con-
temptible domestic characters. On the wall of
every woman’s club and workroom there ought to

■“ Beware of Spikey Mo ! ”
Victorian Treasurer Bent having squeezed
an alleged surplus of £500,000 out of the sweated
public servants, the pensioners, and other poor
unfortunates —“ it is actually in the bank,” Bent
says—is now promising all and sundry a bite out
of the beautiful half-million. Bent doesn’t seem
to realise that the money isn’t his to spend. Vic-
toria already possesses an accumulated deficit of
£2,600,000, money temporarily taken from Savings
Bank depositors, the deposits of insurance com-
panies and so forth—and honest George Turner,
in ’97, passed the Trust Funds Act, which
specifically directs future Treasurers to devote all
surpluses to the liquidation of previous deficits.
Apparently Bent considers himself above the law
—the law which honest Treasurer Turner passed
for the restraint of dishonest Treasurers like Bent.
Victorian Minister of Lands has on the
records of his department a family of five sons.
The first is Uriah Melancthon Wyeliffe Gabriel
Wesley; the second Paul Ooutsey Joshua John
Huss; the third Rose Cranmer Ridley Gideon

William, and the youngest Amos Coverdale Lati-
mer James Whitfield. These people have all
taken up land. When one wants to drive in a
post he takes on all his names and jumps heavily.

Extracts from recent leading article in
Sydney Evening News
Japan has shown herself, too, progressive, capable and
energetic in such an extraordinary degree as to, in an in-
credibly short time, raise herself from the position of a
barbaric nonentity to a high place among the world’s
great powers.
The fine arts were flourishing in Japan when Britons
wore woad in place of wool.
The pro-Buddhist crowd is rather worried these
times. It is always calling on us to admire the
Japanese as a race which has sprung in 30 years
from barbarism to advanced civilisation. Then
when the Jap is called an upstart the pro-Buddhist
gets angry and says Japan has been in an advance d
state of civilisation for twenty centuries.
A correspondent inquires :
What is an Australian, who is a democrat and who does
not believe in kings and governors, etc., to do when the
National Anthem is played and he does not want to look a
boor ? Should he stand and take off his hat ?>
The Bulletin reckons that if its correspondent
had intended to keep on his hat . or to remain
sitting, the unexpected repetition of a bit of very
bad verse should make no difference in his in-
tentions. And if anyone says that his conduct in
ignoring the anthem stamps him as a boor that
person isn’t telling the truth. Any person save a
boor would rise up and take off his hat to greet a
lady, but the anthem isn’t a lady.
An item from Propsting’s island : — 1
The much-travelled J. S. 0. Elkington, Chief Medical
Officer of Tasmania, continues to show a healthy deter-
mination to straighten things up and astonish the natives.
In his travels about the island he has already routed
various ancient and abominable abuses, and demonstrated
the tom-foolishness of certain accepted traditions. There
is a tradition, for instance, that old Dan Burke’s munici-
pality of Westbury is the model municipality of Vande-
moni'a; but right at that spot, flourishing and un-
ashamed, Elkington found certain of the foulest dairies
of his experience. Just at present he is lecturing. He
draws moving pictures of the horror of the old-established
diseases, purples into positive oratory over the virtues of
cleanliness and sanitary decency, and illustrates all this
effective talk with lantern-slides of a most extraordinary
and gruesome character. He says, in effect, “If you
don’t clean up your foetid back-yards, and flush your un-
speakable drains, and generally drop your Vandemonian
apathy and begin to take care of yourselves, you’ll almost
certainly be stricken with loathsome diseases, so that
your fevered flesh will deliquesce into exceedingly objec-
tionable pus, and all the fires of —ah —Hades will seem to
get adrift in your blood and entrails, and you’ll be the
horror of your unfortunate nurses till you make an ex-
ceptionally bad death. If you reform, you may escape
these disagreeables. If you don’t —well, I have warned
you, and it’s your —ah —funeral, anyway.” And at that
the very energetic officer subsides with an air of great
languor. That is his way.
The anti-socialistic farmer of Westralia
begins to call loudly for State flour mills. One,
described as a representative farmer of Northam,
told an interviewer, the other day, that he was
satisfied farmers were “ practically unanimous in
favor of State mills being erected.” Westralian
flour commands a poor price compared with South
Australian; yet it is alleged that Westralian
wheat is quite as good as that grown in the
Eastern States, and that the loss is simply through
faulty milling in mills run by private enterprise.
But they will probably go on returning men to
Parliament who denounce State interference with
private enterprise as an invention of the devil;
and even if they get a member who will allow
them their little bit of interference, they will
pledge him to sit down hard when anybody else
wants a little bit for himself.
Died, recently, at Liverpool (N.S.W.),
William Broughton, who was born at Appin in
1828. He was the grandson of William Broughton,
whose name appears in the Records as Govern-
ment storekeeper at Parramatta —appointed to the
post by Governor Phillip, Feb., 1789. Though a
“first fleeter,” Mr. Storekeeper Broughton came
out free. The recently-deceased gentleman was
related to an unobtrusive public benefactor—
O’Brien, of Yass, who in slack times (1842) dis-
covered that sheep, which were worth Is. a head
running about, were worth Bs. turned into tallow.

MAGIC.
In ancient days the remarkable curative properties of a medicine which possessed the power to
complaints so, seemingly, different in their origin as
Rheumatism
Gout
Neuralgia
Backache
Sciatica
Indigestion
Anaemia
Blood Disorders
Biliousness
Jaundice
Gravel
Stone
Bladder Troubles
General Debility
Sick Headache
would have been regarded as magical, but Mrgic is dead and Science reigns supreme. I\o effect is
now allowed to be attributed to a supernatural came. We demand in each case a scientific explana-
tion, definite, dear, and comprehensive. In orc.er that it may be fully understood why
Warner’s Safe Cure
•ures, as it does, all of the above-mentioned disorders completely and permanently, it must be realised
that each of them is but the manifestation of a diseased or inactive condition of the
KIDNEYS AND LIVER
If these vital organs are working freely and perfectly, none of the disorders in the list given can
afflict us. This important fact will be fully realised by reading the following description of the won-
derful functions performed by the kidneys and liver.
Tlie Kidneys filter and extract from the blood about three pints of urine every day. In this
quantity of urine are dissolved about an ounce of urea, ten to twelve grains,in weight of uric acid,
together with other animal and mineral matter varying from a third of an ounce to nearly an ounce.
When the kidneys are in health, all this solid matter is in solution and is invisible. Directly the
kidneys, through either weakness or disease, become unfit to do their duty properly, a proportion of
the solid matter remains in the blood, becomes actively poisonous and causes us to suffer from uric
disorders such as Rheumatism, Gout, Neuralgia, Lumbago, Backache, Sciatica, Gravel,
Stone, Bladder Troubles, and Bright’s Disease. A simple test to make as to the condition
of the kidneys is to place some urine, passed the first thing in the morning, in a covered glass, and
let it stand until next morning. If it is then cloudy, or there is a brick-dust like sediment, or if
particles float about in it, or it is of an unnatural color, the kidneys are not healthy, and no time must
be lost in adopting remedial measures, or Bright’s Disease, Diabetes, or some less serious but more
painful illness will result.
The Liver. —In the liver various substances are actually made from the blood. Two or three
pounds of bile are thus made from the blood every day. The liver takes sugar from the blood,
uonverts it into another form, and stores it up so as to be able to again supply it to the blood,
gradually, as the latter requires enrichment. The liver changes uric acid, which is insoluble, into
urea, which is completely soluble, and the liver also deals with blood corpuscles which have lived their
life and are useful no longer. When the liver is inactive or diseased we suffer from Indigestion,
Biliousness, Anaemia, Sick Headache and Blood Disorders.
The health of the liver and of the kidneys is so closely connected that it is almost impossible for
the kidneys to be affected, and the liver to remain healthy, or vice versa.
It is nearly thirty years since scientific research, directed specially to diseases of the Kidneys
and Liver, was rewarded by the discovery of the medicine now known throughout the world as
Warner’s Safe Cure. It was realised, at the outset of the investigation, that it was necessary
to find a curative agent which would act equally upon the kidneys and, upon the liver, these
organs being so immediately associated in the work of dealing with the body’s waste material, and,
after many disappointments, the medicine which possessed the required action in the fullest
degree was at length discovered. Warner’s Safe Cure cures all diseases of the kidneys
and liver, and, by restoring their activity, these vital organs are enabled to rid the body, through
the natural channels, of the urinary and biliary poisons, the presence of which in the system, are the
cause of Rheumatism, Gout, Neuralgia, Lumbago, Backache, Sciatica, Blood Disorders, Anaemia,
Indigestion, Biliousness, Jaundice, Sick Headache, Gravel, Stone, Bladder Troubles, and General
Debility. Warner’s Sate Cure cures all these disorders simply by removing the cause of tie disorder,
is the reason why cures effected by Warner’s Safe Cure are permanent cures. [24.
Sydney Heads.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ON wide white wing, above the seaway noise,
Where beats the wanton wave with futile
force
Against the rocks, the great gulls pause, and poise,
Or, through the air, cleave out a careless course
On powerful pinions, circle, sweep and fly;
And far below, grim, gaunt and still we lie.
We watch, unmoved, the wandering wastes of sea,
The great, grey waves that gather, curl and comb,
The snarling surges wolfwise racing free,
The tumbling tumult flecked with fairy foam.
Still, silent sentinels, we stand and gaze,
To sight the ships from all the world’s highways.
From all the world, white weft or sea-grimed sail,
Showing the sign of every flag that flies,
Black ocean tramp, and freshly-painted mail,
Bear in their bulk of motley merchandise,
Gay, glittering gauds of bracelet, brooch and ring,
Foodstuffs and cloth, and goodly gear they bring.
We see the ships heave out past reach and rocks,
Wool-laden, bale on close-packed bale and brand,
The full-tale tribute of a thousand flocks,
From shearing shed and station far inland.
Out and away, in-tide or seaward flow,
By night and day, the ships glide forth and go.
Or ever men traversed the traceless track
From main to main, in liner, tramp, or sail,
Abiding Time, enduring rage and rack
Of howling hurricane and shrieking gale,
We held our place, head-high above the stress
Of straining seas and wild tumultuousness.
All night the South Head light glows out and
gleams;
All night the waves, in whispers to the land,
Half-sleeping, tell their thousand thoughts and
dreams,
Whilst far above we hear and understand.
The murmuring waters weave a subtle spell
Of glamor round the endless tales they tell.
O ! wondrous tales of marvels hidden deep,
Fathoms beneath green ocean’s tireless tide,
Sad songs of death, of weary eyes that sleep,
For ever closed, of sluggish men who died
Fighting for life, till gathered by the sea,
Cradled and rocked, their riving souls set free.
Spent sailormen, whose weary souls had fled,
Sloughing the shell swayed in its shifting womb,
Stout ships and strong, borne under, spar and
shred,
Midst stress and strife and tossing salt sea spume.
Aye, many other things the green waste saith,
And much it speaks of Love, but most of Death.
All time and ever, landmarks fixed and plain,
By day, by night, in calm or heading swell,
We greet the ships, in from the outer main,
We give the outward-bound a last farewell;
And plunging past, with brine-bright bows, they
steer
To open sea, nor ever heed nor hear.
N.S.W.
EDGAR HEANE HARRIS.
A Pair of Creamies.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ nm *~R. BARRY ’ere?”
|W| Barry took the wire from the khaki-
clad messenger, and, after perusing it,
blithely flung his topee heavenward.
“ Boys,” he cried, “ I’ve got a shift south. Fill
’em up again, and drink the health of tbe G.Mi—
may his soul frizzle for not thinking of me
sooner! ” he concluded, devoutly, as the drinks
disappeared.
Barry had been managing Binjie Downs for the
past six years, on behalf of the Equatorial Finance
Company. During that period he had been chiefly
remarkable for his capacity for holding alcohol,
the size and variety of his fabrications, and the
number of his amours noirs, none of which amiable
weaknesses detracted from his popularity in the
township of Undilla, where he was wont to spend
his hours of relaxation. A tendency which he had
towards practical joking was not so favorably
looked upon, but as he stood seventy-four inches
high, and carried fifteen stone of hard bone and
muscle, he generally escaped any unpleasant con-
sequences which might arise from what he termed
his “little divarshuns.”
Barry started over to the telegraph office to
reply to his Wire, while the rest of the company
discussed the news.
Gilder, of the bank, mooted the question of a
send-off, and the others acclaimed the suggestion
unanimously, with the single exception of Macin-
tosh, the doctor, who was troubled with liver at
the moment, and who also had a grievance against
Barry—a grievance connected with the painting
of the medico’s house in stripes one “wet” night.
“ However, if ye put it in the licht o’ a thanks-
offerin’ for deleeverance from the deevil, ah’m
yere mon,” said the doctor, ungraciously.
Gilder (who acted as understudy to Barry in
his jocular moments) made a sarcastic allusion to
carpenter’s tools in connection with Scotchmen’s
heads and humor, whereupon the man of physic,
fixing his gaze upon him, rejoined with some
emphasis:—
“ Ah’ve no doot ye’re speakin’ from experience,
Mr. Gilder, for from my knowledge a’ anahtomy,
ah’d stake my professional reputation that yere
heid-piece was no made wi’oot the aid o’ a turnin’-
lathe an’ chisel, an’ a dom’d weel-tempered one at
that.”
While the crestfallen banker was ruminating
over, a suitable retort, the rest were occupied in
forming a committee to carry out the farewelling
of Barry in a manner befitting the reputation of
Undilla, and by the time the large man returned,
all preliminaries had been arranged. Everyone
was eager to shake the departing friend by the
hand with assurances of goodwill, and as each of
these ceremonies necessitated an adjournment to
the bar, the hour was late and the company mellow
by the time the fifteenth man had expressed his
feelings. Barry was overcome by emotion at this
ue-timony of the esteem in which he was held, and
wept copiously, the tears dropping from a great
ne:ght.
“Boys,” he said, “as to the place I’ll say
nothing, but for yourselves, it’s sorry I am to
leave you. There’s one thing I’d like to mention,
though; I have a slashing pair of creamies at
Binjie, and I don’t want to leave ’em to the
mercies of a stranger. Now, I’d like you all to
have ’em, but as you can’t do that, I propose to
raffle ’em, and then when I’m gone I’ll know a
friend will be looking after the beauties.”
All present applauded the proposition, with the
exception of the Doctor again, upon whom whisky
seemed to have a souring effect..
“ Ah’ve never obsairved ye wi’ a pair o’ creamies,
Barry,” he said.
“No, you haven’t seen ’em, Doc. You see I
bred ’em myself, and have just broken ’em in
quietly. Haven’t had ’em in here yet, but I’m
open to bet there’s nothing better bred in this
district,” was the reply.
“ Binjie-bred ” was a synonym for equine ex-
cellence round about Undilla, so the amount
required, made of notes, cheques, and I O U’s,
was soon forthcoming to fill up the raffle.
Despite Barry’s appeal that they should post-
pone the drawing until the prizes arrived in town,
the speculators insisted on the event coming off
there and then. Dice were procured, and, amid
some excitement, Gilder was adjudged the lucky
man at the conclusion of the throwing.
(Condensed from the Undilla Chronicle).
The farewell banquet tendered to Mr. Thomas Barry,
of Binjie Downs, was held last night at the Royal Hotel,
and was a most successful function. Nearly every repre-
sentative man of the town and district was present, and
the tables groaned beneath (etc., etc.) . . . Our worthy
P;M. occupied the chair, and in felicitous terms proposed
the toast of the guest of the evening. Mr. Barry in
responding appeared much affected, and feelingly observed
that he would never forget . . . (and so forth). He was
proud to see So many of his friends present, more especially
his old and intimate friend, Mr. Gilder, whom he was
pleased to say had become the possessor of his pair of
favorite creamies. (Loud applause.) He would conclude
with the hope, that when he had departed from among
them, their thoughts would still revert sometimes to
their old friend Barry of Binjie. (Prolonged cheering).
Immediately on the conclusion of the banquet, Mr.
Barry left by Cobb’s coach for the South.
Gn the morning after the send-off, Gilder woke
up in his quarters at the Reconstructed Bank
with a most aggressive “head,” and, lifting his
voice, he besought his junior to bring him a pick-
me-up, and save his iife. With a promptitude
worthy of the Humane Society’s medal, the one
appealed to came in with a hissing whisky and
soda, and, while Gilder was drinking, informed
him that a black gin was waiting to see him with
a letter,
“Barry’s creamies arrived yet?” inquired the
manager.
“ No, haven’t seen them,” was the reply.
“Well, I’ll be out in a minute,” said Gilder, as
he tried to reduce the size of his head with cold
water.
On the verandah he found an abnormally fat gin
nursing two half-caste piccaninnies, apparently
twins.
“ What is it, Mary ? ” he asked.
“ Mr. Barry been send ’em,” she replied.
“ Send what ? The horses ? ”
“Baal horse. Piccaninny. Belonga paper-
yabber,” she said, producing a letter.
Gilder took the missive and with gradually dis-
tending eyes and drooping jaw read the following:
Dear Gilder, —With this note you will receive the two
creamies that you, were fortunate enough to win in my
raffle. I can assure you that they are, as I previously
told you, better bred than anything in your God-forsaken
district, and I trust that the care and training of them
will cause you to be sometimes reminiscent of your old
friend, Tom Barry.
JASON.
The Watson Government intends to wipe
out the German lottery confidence men who have
hitherto been allowed to flood the Commonwealth
with their circulars. The Postmaster-General has
issued a prohibition against transmission of letters
to three Hamburg “ bankers,” who will, most
likely, rush to Yon Bfilow for redress and ask for
German Government intervention against “Aus-
tralian aggression! ”
“Hermes” has a spell of looking back-
ward :
I don’t often get retrospective, but when I watched
that huge procession of the Cycling Union filing through
Centennial Park, Sydney, I thought of what a tame affair
their outing was to the last procession I joined in. There
were 200 of us, and all on the old-fashioned, high
machines, The captains and marshals rode in front, and
we all had our legs over the handles, riding- down
Muldoon’s Hilt We couldn’t have stopped to save the
blessed British Empire, so we looked calm and rode on
austerely. The marshal wound round the curving- hill-
road, and from his invisibility roared something which,
though we could not understand it, we knew was a
warning. But we could not stop, so we rode on
austerely and saw the marshal lying in the road, with
Muldoon’s old bull standing sentry over him. Two
hundred throats cursed as one bellow, two hundred bells
clanged simultaneously : Muldoon’s bull flung up his head
and dashed across the road after Strawberry ana Spot,
and when I got out of that gorse hedge I felt I was carry-
ing away more of Muldoon’s property than I could bear.
It cost me a few pounds to get the doctor to pick all the
property out of me. I swore then that though “ safeties ”
might be effeminate I would ride nothing else in future.
Then I went away to the country, sold my spider to a man
who had caught the craze and thought he would look
imposing on a high wheel ; and bought a dream of a
“ safety.” The conditions of the sale provided that I
should call round on my friend at his home, eight miles
away, on Sunday and teach him how to ride.
When I arrived there that fresh dewy morning he told me
proudly that he had “learned himself ” through the week,
and was going to ride down to my place for dinner. Then
he inquired anxiously, “ Are there any telegraph poles or
lamps handy to your place ? ” “ Heaps ! ” I said, “ why ? ”
“ Oh, nothing, nothing—l thought there were, that was
all.” My place was a pub which we dignified by the name
of “the Club,” and where they always had turkeys on
Sunday. The man on the “ spider ” rode excellently—he
even wanted to race me occasionally, and he seemed so
much at home on the ordinary, which I wasn’t on the
tender-nosed “safety,” that I began to regret having
parted with the high one. When we arrived within view
of “ the Club,” we found the usual gaping crowd on the
verandah. “ Are there any telegraph poles round the
corner?” asked my mate flurnedly. “Oh, yes, any
quantity—why are you so interested in telegraph poles ? ”
I rode up to the verandah and dismounted, but the man
on the ordinary swept on round the corner. “ Here !
here—this is my place ! ” I yelled, running after him.
The crowd, having nothing better to do, followed. We
all arrived round the corner just in time to see my mate
ride up to a telegraph pole and clutch it with
both arms, and when the bike had wandered away
from beneath him about half a mile down the
road into a horse pond, he slid down to the ground
uninjured. He blushingly explained that he always got
off that way, and that he never rode where there were no
telegraph or lamp-posts. After dinner we fished out the
bike and cleaned it, and started back for his sylvan home
by the gorse bush. Half-way there, where there wasn’t
a telegl-aph pole within miles, a fiend in human form
came to the door of a house and waved a whisky bottle
and an invitation. I dismounted at once, but the man on
the ordinary hesitated and kept going slowly. Then the
fiend waved the whisky bottle again, and the man on the
ordinary tried it. He raised his right leg cautiously—the
machine raised its back wheel just as warily. The
man put his right leg down in a hurry and tried to grip
the pedal, the machine turned its back wheel round a
little and heeled over, and then the man lost his balance
and fell clean through the middle of it. To save him
from death by strangulation we had to cut the tyre from
round his neck in three pieces with a pruning-knife.
Then we carried him inside and tugged all the broken
spokes out of him, and to bring the fellow round the fiend
poured all the whisky down his throat, and there was
none left forme
Some facts trotted out by Rev. C. Tregear
at a recent Pleasant Sunday Afternoon gathering
in Wesley Church, Melbourne :
The Duke of Sutherland owns one-eighth of Scotland.
Parts of his property, which used to send out 1000 fighting
men, are now occupied by two gamekeepers and some
pheasants or deer. Four-fifths of England’s foodstuff
used to be home-grown ; now only one-third is home-
grown Seven thousand persons own four-fifths of the
United Kingdom. In the Western District of Victoria,
i 79 people own 5,000,000 acres of fertile land. Nothing if,
done with it. It is valued for taxation at £2 and worth
at least £lO per acre. Chirnsides’ land at Werribee is
valued at £2 per acre for purposes of taxation, Chirn-
sides asked the Metropolitan Board of Works £25 per
acre ; they got £l7 per acre for 9000 acres.

IS THIS YOUR STORY?
The back always aching; work impossible ;no rest at
night; afraid to bend ; standing erect causes a sharp, stab-
like pain that almost takes away your breath, and leaves
you weak, nervous and despairing —is this your story ?
But you can be cured, and your neighbor, a Sydney
man, who has been permanently cured, tells you how.
Urinary disorders, puffy eyes, swollen ankles, dizziness,
sallow and pimply complexion, irregular heart —all these
and many other troubles are caused by the kidney poisons
in the body, and they are the thin edge of the wedge of
Bright’s disease and dropsy.

Are You Nervous and Irritable?
Are You Run-Down or Rheumatic?
Kidney trouble affects the Whole System.
" Every Picture tells a Story. ”
DOAN'S
Backache
Kidney Pills
The Genuine Doans, help the kidneys to take out all the
kidney poisons ; they strengthen the kidneys, and that is
why cures are lasting. The Genuine Doan’s have no
action on the bowels.
The word of this Sydney resident is good evidence of
the great merit of Doan’s Backache Kidney PiPs in all
forms of kidney and bladder troubles. They relieve the
tired, aching back ; drive out the poisonous uric acid which
causes gravel, pains in the joints, head and muscles; and
permanently cure the cause of urinary disorders and
bladder complaint.
SYDNEY PROOF.
Mr. Jos. Grieve, Wood and Goal Merchant. 18 Albion-street, Surry
Hills, states: “For the past five or six years I suffered from kidney dis-
order, which caused me constant pain. The symptoms of this terrible
complaint were severe backache, and irregularity of the secretions of the
kidneys. The pain has such complete mastery over me that at times I could
not rise from my bed. I went to doctors to see what their skill could do for
me, but gained no benefit from them. I tried medicines, with no better
results. One day I saw an advertisement regarding a remedy for kidney
trouble, and as it was not a nostrum said to cure everything under the sun,
I procured a box of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. I felt a sense of relief
right from the first dose. My pain gradually grew less, and finally disap-
peared, as did the other symptoms of kidney disorder.” _
This is Mr. Grieve’s testimony, given twelve months’ later: “Twelve
months ago I was cured by Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. I am still a
believer in these Pills, having never had a return of my complaint since,
except on one occasion, when I got wet; but a few doses of these pills
quickly set me right again. I had been a terrible sufferer with the kidneys,
and nothing ever gave me relief but Doan’s. Backache Kidney Pills, and
they cured me. If I hear anybody complaining of a bad back I always tell
them of the medicine which cured me.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are sold by all Chemists and Store-
keepers at 2s 9d per box (six boxes 15s 3d) or will be posted on receipt of
price by Foster-McClellan Co., 76 Pitt-street, Sydney.
But be Sure they are DOAN’S.
ECZEMA.
Nothing spoils a good disposition quicker.
Nothing taxes a man’s patience
Like any irritation of the skin.
Piles almost drive you crazy.
All day they make you miserable.
All night they keep you awake.
Just the same with Eczema.
Such miseries are daily decreasing.
People are learning they can be cured.
Learning the merit of Doan’s Ointment. .
Plenty of proof that Doan’s Ointment will
cure Piles, ...
Eczema, or any irritation of the skin.
Read the testimony of a Sydney citizen
Mrs. Peters, 15 Edward-street, Redfern,
says : “ About two years ago I testified that
Doan’s Ointment had cured me of Eczema of
five years’ standing. lam better able to
bear out the statement now than I was two
years ago, as the cure has been proven since
then. I’ve been free of the itch ever since ;
in fact, perfectly cured. At the time-two
years ago—l had suffered with burning itch
on the leg that was very hard to-bear. In
hot weather it used to be terrible. I had a
good deal of treatment. I had it seen to bv
a number of doctors, but it baffled them, and
I was also treated as an outdoor patient at
the hospital without better result. I came
to use Doan’s Ointment by hearing so many
people speak of it as an excellent remedy for
itching skin trouble.”
Doan’s Ointment is splendid in all diseases
of the skin, eczema, piles, hives, sores, insect
bites, chilblains, &c. It is perfectly safe
and very effective. Very often two or three
pots have cured chronic cases, where other
remedies have failed for years.
Doan’s Ointment is sold by all Chemists
and Storekeepers at 2s. 9d. per pot, or will
be posted on receipt of price by Foster-

The Wondrous World is Wide.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OH! the Wondrous World is wide, and for
you and me beside.
And for everyone that’s in it there is
room;
There is plenty and to spare to give everyone a
share,
And none need pine in sorrow and in gloom.
Oh, the summer rains fell fast, but the sun shone
out at last,
And smiled upon the mellow, fruitful Earth ;
Then the crops grew rank and green, but the
weeds grew in between—
Just as sorrow ever mingles with our mirth.
Oh ! the fruitful Earth is kind. If the wooing’s
to her mind,
The dowry will the wooing well repay ;
Eor there’s wealth that may be won, though
there’s labor to be done
And the weak may fall and perish by the way.
Oh ! the ripened golden grain they have garnered
once again—
But the reaper’s only share was in the toil.
Eor the robber’s yellow gold the earth is bought
and sold,
And Earth’s true children driven from the soil.
Eor the ripened golden grain, and the ships upon
the main,
The treasures of the sea, the field and mine,
The flowers that bloom and blow ’neath the sum-
mer’s sunny glow,
No joy they bring to either mine or thine.
Eor the greedy robber crew they neither dare nor
do,
They sit at home and laugh and 101 l and feast,
And drink the rich red wine and dress in raiment
fine —
While the Worker pays his tribute to the Beast.
Oh! the world is turning fast, and the years are
flying past;
As it was, it is, and so it will remain,
Till our eyes discern the light, and we learn the
lesson right—•
That the reaper and the sower own the grain.
Oh ! the Wondrous World so wide re-echoes to
the stride
Of the weary, restless ones who toil and die.
Through the earth they come and go, and wander
to and fro—
Eor their weary heads they find no place to he.
Oh ! the Wondrous World so wide in the market
has been cried,
Tfcey have bartered it and sold it o’er and o’er.
And our birthright they have stole, from Pole
around to Pole—
And the Wondrous World is wide for us no more.
Oh! how long, O Lord ! how long, shall the
burden and the wrong
Be placed upon the shoulders of the weak ?
And the robbers own the soil, while the workers
own the toil ?
We are waiting for Thy mighty voice to speak.
Oh ! the Wondrous World is wide, and for you
and me beside,
And for everyone that’s in it there is room ;
But “ ’tis ours,” the robbers rave—for the workers
there’s the grave;
Like a bride, the grave is waiting for the groom.
Q.
AUSTIN DODD.
Alligators, &c.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
** ■ "V ON’T you think we could cross now ? ”
| W inquired the red-headed man, as we sat
watching the falling creek.
“Well, I don’t think it’s quite a swim, but
there’s an alligator been seen about this crossing
lately, so I think we had better wait a bit,” I
replied.
“ These alligators are curious critters,” said the
man with the red head. “ Last time I was in this
district me and Bill Blakey were getting sleepers
for the railway down at Alligator Creek. We
were camped right on the bank of the creek, and
any scraps of meat we had left over we used to
throw into the water, so as not to bring the ants
about. Before we had been there long we noticed
there was something waiting for those scraps-
regular every meal. At first, we reckoned fish,
but soon discovered it was alligators.
“Competition got so keen amongst them that
they would spring half out of the water when they
saw anything coming, and catch it like a dog.
Kangaroos and wallabies were very plentiful about
there, and Bill had a gun, so he used to shoot one
or two every day just to feed our pets, as he called
them. They kept getting tamer and tamer, until
they used to come crawling up the bank regular
every meal-time to get their rations. There were
six of them constant, and sometimes seven, if they
happened to have a friend calling on them ; and
they got so tame, eventually, that they came up
within three yards of the table, and sat in a half-
circle in front of us while we were at our meals—
just like dogs. We christened them, and in less
than a month they would all answer to their
names. When we called one to open his mouth
be would split about a third of the way and show
a cavern you could have backed a dray into,
whilst the others would sit as politely as you
please, just gently wagging their tails and
smiling, waiting their turn. They were the
politest animals I ever see—no crowding or
jostling about them.
“ Things went on like this for weeks, and then
our pets seemed to get restless all of a sudden.
We could see them crawling over a sandbank
about a hundred yards below our camp, day and
night, as if they were looking for something
and couldn’t find it. ‘ By gosh ! ’ says Bill to
me at last, ‘I know what’s the matter—they
wants to lay.’ And with that he picks up a shovel
and takes half-a-dozen eggs we’d got that day
from a cocky, and off he goes down to the sand-
bank. Well, he scoops out half-a-dozen holes in
the sand and pops an egg in each. Before we
went to bed that night we sees the alligators a-
crawling over the bank examining the holes. Next
morning, when we were having breakfast, our
pets turned up with a serene, contented expression
on their faces that had been foreign to them for
days past. Before going to work Bill suggested
that we should go down and have a look at the
nests; so down we goes and rakes in 49 dozen and
7 eggs.
“ The next morning we gets even more, and
they averaged from 50 to 60 dozen a night for
weeks. We had a lot of cases about the place that
we had got goods in, so we packs them all full of
eggs, and when the Frenchman came down wii,i
his cutter for the sleepers we sends up a consign-
ment of eggs to the Mackay market. We soon
swamped the local market, and then we exported
them to Townsville and the Towers, where they
met with a ready sale. There were pars, in the
Mackay papers about ‘ our new poultry-raising
industry,’ and everything was booming, and we
were simply coining money, when an unforeseen
occurrence gave the show away.
“ It seems that a lot of the people who had pur-
chased eggs had set them under hens to hatch—a
thing we had never thought of. When the chickens
ought to have appeared they didn’t. The shells
were found empty, but the chickens —‘Where,
oh ! where were they ? ’ About the same time the
yards were found to be overrun with a new sort of
lizard, which was at first suspected of having
destroyed the chickens. Some children tried to
catch the lizards and got their fingers snapped off.
Then it dawned on our customers what sort of
eggs they had been buying, and a deputation of
them started down to interview us with axes. For-
tunately the Frenchman managed to send us the
tip in time, and we created remoteness between us
and the deputation. It was an awful pity our
industry got bust-up just then, as Bill was going
to try some experiments in crossing alligators with
poultry, and we had great hopes of producing fine,
large table crocodiles with wings that would be the
finest layers in creation. But it’s always the way
in this blasted country. What with socialistic
legislation and the control of the Labor party,
as soon as a man settles down and gets into a
good way of making a living, something’s sure to
happen.”
“You do seem to have hard luck," I remarked,
“ but you must have cleared a bit out of the eggs.”
“ Yes; but what good was that to me ? I lost it
all shortly afterwards in the poultry business.
You see, I’d been telling Bill about that magnetic
iron country up North and happened to mention
that there were an awful lot of emus running about
there, so nothing would do him but we must go up
and catch a team of 16 or 18 of them, and break
them into harness. He said we could both make a
good living out of them driving people round
some zoological garden in a big town. He said
riding round on the elephant for twopence was
getting stale, and lots of people would sooner pay
sixpence to be driven round with a team of emus.
I didn’t think much of the idea myself, but Bill
had a hankering after that sort of business. He
had been sort of brought up in a menagerie him-
self. He told me the first job he ever had was
chewing liver for orphan cubs, and then he had
been promoted to feeding the animals as he grew
up, and he longed for that sort of life.
“ ‘But how are you going to catch these bloom-
ing emus?’ I asked him. ‘You leave that to
me,’ he says, as confident as you please. ‘ I know
more about animals and fowls of all sorts than you
do, and I never heard of more favorable condi-
tions for catching emus.’
“Well, I allows myself to be persuaded, and
we rides up to Bowen and ships ourselves and our
horses to Cooktown, along with a light buck-
board buggy that we bought in Townsville, cheap.
Then we drove out to the station where the
magnetic ironstone was, and fixed our camp. Bill
had brought about a cwt. of small sorap-iron with
him, in a bag, and now we polished this by
running it backwards and forwards in the bag
with some sand until we got it bright. Then we
placed it out near the patches of magnetic iron-
stone, and Bill stuck up a lot of sticks with pieces
of red rag on them —to attract the notice of the
emus. I didn’t know what the deuce he was
driving at, at first, but by-and-by it began to
dawn on me, and I saw the whole scheme.
“Of course, the emus came and scoffed up that
scrap-iron, and then all we had to do was to dodge
them over a patch of the magnetic ironstone.
There was about twenty of them in the mob and
it was rum to see them when they struck a patch
of the magnetic stone. They went running along,
getting down lower and lower as the attraction
worked on them, until suddenly they went down
flop, and there they were as if glued to the stone.
We went up aiid short-hobbled them all. Then we
tried to pull them off the stone, but we couldn’t
—they were simply froze there and wouldn’t shift.
Then Bill pulls a bottle out of his pocket and gives
one of them an emetic; but it was no use—the
bird turned white at the gills and started a sort of
hiccough, but it couldn’t bring anything up.’
“‘Well, I’m blowed!’ said Bill. ‘I never
reckoned on anything so powerful as this.’ Then
we got sort of aggravated, and caught hold of a
leg each and pulled for all we were worth, and we
got that bird off, but its inside remained. stuck to
the stone, and, of course, being dead, it was no
use to us.
“ ‘ Now, this is a pretty to-do,’ says Bill, ‘ to be
baulked like this just on the point of success.
Let’s sit down and have a smoke, and I’ll think of
some way out of the difficulty.’
“Well, we hadn’t been smoking five minutes
when Bill jumps up and says, ‘By gosh ! I’ve got
it ’; and he explains, and I sees it at once. We
went and got a big loose slab of magnetic rock,
just as heavy as we could carry, and holds it over
their backs to counteract the influence of the rock
underneath, as it were, and slithers them off one
by one on to the grass, where we coupled them up.
“Bill took a couple of days breaking-in and
mouthing the team, and then we starts off for
Cooktown again, Bill driving 18 emus and me
riding my own horse and leading his. My swag,
with all my money in it, was in the buggy, and
I’ve never seen it from that day to this, nor Bill
neither. He must have travelled about 150 miles
a-day, for when I managed to reach Cooktown he
and his team of emus had gone by steamer a week
before, and I was left with a pair of miserable
scallywags of horses that I could not get a fiver
for. I heard afterwards that Bill simply coined
money in London and Paris, but I have never
been able to raise enough to pay my passage
there, or I’d go after him and get my share of the
proceeds, or there would be a row, I can tell you.”
“You do seem to have been a bit unlucky,” I
said. “But hadn’t Bill any scheme for crossing
alligators with emus and producing a new stamp
of draught stock that would work well in boggy
ground and lay eggs in their spare time ? ”
“I never heard him mention it,” said the red-
haired one, “ but it sounds feasible enough. Bill,
however, preferred to cross the ocean with the
emus, and produce a considerable distance between
him and me.”

A Blood-Purifier
Impure Blood. Abscesses. Now Strong and Robust.

Mrs. Annie
Snook, of Auck-
land, New Zealand,
sends us her photo-
graph, and says:
“ I was a strong,
healthy woman
until about live
years ago. While
living in England,
on recovering from
an attack of the
measles, I took a
cli £l, had a relapse,
and came very near
dying. My blood
was left in a very
bad state. Ab-
scesses formed on
my body. I was
confined to my bed
two-thirds of the
time, and at times
unable to move.
For two years I
failed to obtain any
relief, and was advised to come to New Zealand. On arriving lieie I con-
tinued about the same, trying many remedies without any relief. About a
year ago I thought I would try Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. Very soon the abscesses
began to heal, and my general health improved. I followed up the treatment,
until now lam as strong and robust as ever. I cannot too strongly recommend
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla as a blood-purifier and tonic.”
You will notice it was “Ayer’s ” Sarsaparilla that made this splendid cure
for Mrs. Snook. There are many other Sarsaparillas on the market, but
there is only one “Ayer’s” Sarsaparilla. It is the old, original, genuine
Sarsaparilla. The Sarsaparilla that has been tested and tried for over sixty
years. Do not run the risk of trying some other kind.

Ch*s. Kean, in coming to Australia. Jefferson has a
pathetic bit in his autobiograpy. While in Melbourne he
strolled in Albert Park, and found Kean sitting discon-
solately on a bench. “ I was too old,” sighed Kean, as
he gazed vaguely over the waters of the lagoon. Barry
Sullivan extinguished the Keans in Melbourne. They
opened with “The Gamester,” .at Ooppin’s Haymarket.
Sullivan at once put on a better performance of the same
play, and followed them thus with “ Richard 111., ’

to be annoyed by a mummer co. staging “Othello,” when
the stage manager came out and said that Desdemona
had suddenly got the cramp, and, as she had no under-
study, they could not play Shakspeare’s drama. He
knew it was a disappointment (?) to the highly intellec-
tual (??) audience, but if they would give the actors half-
an-hour to make-up, the co. would produce Who Killed
Him,” or “ The Midnight Murder,” or “ The Body m the
Paddock’’—whichever the audience pleased. The audi-
ence chose the last, and I was glad that Desdemona bad
the cramp. If these people had acted “Othello’ like
that, and left his b)ack remains in a paddock at Venice, it
would have been terrible.

“ J.S.” on the buried past: — *
Took % walk round the Haymarket (Sydney) last Satur-
day night,-and followed some people into the old Alhambra
Music Hall. How are the mighty fallen ! When
Frank Smith was coining money in the late ’Bo’s, the pro-
grammes and advts. used to bear the heading .
“ Minstrels shows may come and go,
But we go on for ever.”
But they didn’t. The last time 1 was in the Hall a lot of
lads were roughing in a ring, a pair at a time, for the
whisper-weight or winkweiglit championship ; prize, hait-
a-crown and a packet of fags, or a million pound purse—
X forget the exact amount. On my present visit
the “ vestibule ” or lodge or whatever the entrance way
used to be called, was full of sacks of chaff, peas,
oats, and other fodder. Inside, fowls and ducks and
geese in cages and crates filled the auditorium. Instead,
of a man grinding out music, a poultry expert was grind-
ing bones or grit. In the stalls and orchestra a Johnny
Allsorts’ shop—fowl medicine, cases of eggs, and incm> a -
tors. On the stage, where-Teddy Shipp and the Pullen
Sisters, Amy Rowe, Harry Barrington and others danced
and sang and gagged, was a loaded incubator, lit up, and
hatching chickens instead of gags. It was labelled,
“ Hatching—Don’t Touch,” and was silently fulfilling
a three weeks’ engagement. I sat down on the
lee side of an unsold rooster and dreamed. As I
dreamed the incubator,disappeared; the churning and
grinding of bone mills tuned into an overture, and the
shuffle of the marketers and cackle of the poultry sounded
like the clatter of a squeezing, pushing, merry audience
of 18 years back. Overture by the company ; Barrington,
interlocutor; Shipp and Gardner and Johnny—the old
and famous Johnny Cowan—and another on the corners.
Singers, Florence Schuler and Amy Rowe, Lawler

gag was going strong even then —song- and dance;
Johnny Cowan in a “speciality” and a farce. Bo vis
Brothers, song and dance ; Walsh and King, song- and
dance. What a mob there was—Florne Martin, Alf
James, Clara Spencer, Delohery, Craydon, and Holland,
the Davis pair, Johnny Collins, and ever so many more.
Then the stage and players fade, and the smell of the in-
cubator lamp remains. That noise wasn’t applause a
fowl lias escaped and a woman holds another by the leg,
and its wings flap. When, the Hicks-Sawyer quartette
sang “In the Sweet By-and-Bye” over Frank Smiths
coffin, and the clods fell in, the glory of the Alhambra
must have been buried along with the old boss.
Charles Fanning, Harry Barrington, and a few others still
play their parts as they did in the old temple which now
serves as a fowl-house. The jackal used to be the symbol
that the glory had departed—he came and howled in
king’s palaces, with the hyena and the scorpion to help
him. I think the. sordid commercial fowl, trying to sell
herself for 3s. 6d. when she knows she is only worth half-
a-crown, is an even sadder emblem of decay.

“ F.” on a vexed, question :
Arthur Gamer, one-time partner of Williamson and
Musgrove, wrote a letter to London Referee some weeks
ago, touching the interminable subject of the first Aus-
tralian theatrical performance, and the fraudulent epi-
logue—
“ True patriots we, for, be it understood.
We left our country for our country’s good,
which was not spoken by a convict on that occasion, and
was never composed by George Barrington or any other
early Australian citizen. Garner s- correction of the
stereotyped mis-statement re the epilogue is
what appears to be an incorrect statement of his own.
He says: “I have a copy of the original playbill betoie
me, and no mention is made of a prologue, neithei does
the name of Barrington appear. . . The plays peifoi med
were ‘ The Busybody ’ .and ‘ The Old Soldier. The per-
Emnfe dSVot tie pta* to the !«««,,»
slab hut was built at a cost of £lOO. The Vic. was
not built until many years afterwards. Garners old
•nlavbill notwithstanding, it is pretty certain that
the 3 first play attempted in the £lOO hut of wdiich he
speaks was Dr. Young’s tragedy of The Reyenge Tw q
o-enuine books by George Barrington (the histories
credited to him were faked up m London from subse-
quent works) are in evidence— A Voyage to
Wales,” called ‘ Botany Bay on the title pa e , and A
Sequel to-Barrington’s Voyage to New South Wales. It
the last chapter of the Sequel the narrator refers to
oneniiw of the first theatre on Saturday, lfitli Januai \
1796 with “ The Revenge ” aforesaid. He gives a nuinbei
of details (quoted in “ Poverty Point not long^since),
hut savs nothing about a printed programme. Perhaps
he wrote from memory, and had got mixed in his
theatrical recollections (the “Sequel waswJlhtlfiav
1801), but the chances are that he named the right plaj.
What is the date on Gamer’s bill, anyhow l

The CARD Concentrator
This Machine has broken Records in the United States, and will do likewise in Australia.
The Mining Investor, Colorado Springs, U.S.A., Nov., 1903, says: “It now becomes the duty of any
mine management to thoroughly inspect, and have it demonstrated to them, the merits of this New Con-
centrator before accepting as a fact that other machines are as good or better, simply because in the years
that are past one or other of these machines have ranked as the best.”
